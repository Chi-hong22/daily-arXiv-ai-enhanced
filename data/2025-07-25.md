### [1] [Lumina-mGPT 2.0: Stand-Alone AutoRegressive Image Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17801)
*Yi Xin,Juncheng Yan,Qi Qin,Zhen Li,Dongyang Liu,Shicheng Li,Victor Shea-Jay Huang,Yupeng Zhou,Renrui Zhang,Le Zhuo,Tiancheng Han,Xiaoqing Sun,Siqi Luo,Mengmeng Wang,Bin Fu,Yuewen Cao,Hongsheng Li,Guangtao Zhai,Xiaohong Liu,Yu Qiao,Peng Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lumina-mGPT 2.0是一个独立的自回归模型，通过从头训练实现高质量图像生成，性能媲美扩散模型，支持多任务处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视并振兴自回归范式，以实现高质量图像生成，同时摆脱对预训练组件或混合架构的依赖。

Method: 采用独立的自回归架构，统一的分词方案支持多任务处理，结合高效解码策略提升生成质量和速度。

Result: 在文本到图像基准测试中表现优异，部分超越扩散模型，并在多任务基准Graph200K上表现突出。

Conclusion: Lumina-mGPT 2.0是一个强大且灵活的统一多模态生成基础模型。

Abstract: We present Lumina-mGPT 2.0, a stand-alone, decoder-only autoregressive model
that revisits and revitalizes the autoregressive paradigm for high-quality
image generation and beyond. Unlike existing approaches that rely on pretrained
components or hybrid architectures, Lumina-mGPT 2.0 is trained entirely from
scratch, enabling unrestricted architectural design and licensing freedom. It
achieves generation quality on par with state-of-the-art diffusion models such
as DALL-E 3 and SANA, while preserving the inherent flexibility and
compositionality of autoregressive modeling. Our unified tokenization scheme
allows the model to seamlessly handle a wide spectrum of tasks-including
subject-driven generation, image editing, controllable synthesis, and dense
prediction-within a single generative framework. To further boost usability, we
incorporate efficient decoding strategies like inference-time scaling and
speculative Jacobi sampling to improve quality and speed, respectively.
Extensive evaluations on standard text-to-image benchmarks (e.g., GenEval, DPG)
demonstrate that Lumina-mGPT 2.0 not only matches but in some cases surpasses
diffusion-based models. Moreover, we confirm its multi-task capabilities on the
Graph200K benchmark, with the native Lumina-mGPT 2.0 performing exceptionally
well. These results position Lumina-mGPT 2.0 as a strong, flexible foundation
model for unified multimodal generation. We have released our training details,
code, and models at https://github.com/Alpha-VLLM/Lumina-mGPT-2.0.

### [2] [SV3.3B: A Sports Video Understanding Model for Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17844)
*Sai Varun Kodathala,Yashwanth Reddy Vutukoori,Rakesh Vunnam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SV3.3B是一个轻量级的3.3B参数视频理解模型，用于自动化体育视频分析，通过创新的时间运动差异采样和自监督学习实现高效设备端部署，性能优于GPT-4o变体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统体育视频分析模型计算密集且缺乏对运动细节的理解，无法捕捉关键的生物力学过渡阶段。

Method: 采用DWT-VGG16-LDA关键帧提取机制和V-DWT-JEPA2编码器，结合LLM解码器，通过自监督学习和掩码去噪目标进行预训练。

Result: 在NSVA篮球数据集上，SV3.3B在文本生成和体育特定评估指标上表现优异，性能提升29.2%，信息密度和动作复杂性显著改善。

Conclusion: SV3.3B为体育视频分析提供了高效且技术细节丰富的解决方案，适合设备端部署。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of automated sports video analysis, which
has traditionally been limited by computationally intensive models requiring
server-side processing and lacking fine-grained understanding of athletic
movements. Current approaches struggle to capture the nuanced biomechanical
transitions essential for meaningful sports analysis, often missing critical
phases like preparation, execution, and follow-through that occur within
seconds. To address these limitations, we introduce SV3.3B, a lightweight 3.3B
parameter video understanding model that combines novel temporal motion
difference sampling with self-supervised learning for efficient on-device
deployment. Our approach employs a DWT-VGG16-LDA based keyframe extraction
mechanism that intelligently identifies the 16 most representative frames from
sports sequences, followed by a V-DWT-JEPA2 encoder pretrained through
mask-denoising objectives and an LLM decoder fine-tuned for sports action
description generation. Evaluated on a subset of the NSVA basketball dataset,
SV3.3B achieves superior performance across both traditional text generation
metrics and sports-specific evaluation criteria, outperforming larger
closed-source models including GPT-4o variants while maintaining significantly
lower computational requirements. Our model demonstrates exceptional capability
in generating technically detailed and analytically rich sports descriptions,
achieving 29.2% improvement over GPT-4o in ground truth validation metrics,
with substantial improvements in information density, action complexity, and
measurement precision metrics essential for comprehensive athletic analysis.

### [3] [Detail++: Training-Free Detail Enhancer for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17853)
*Lifeng Chen,Jiner Wang,Zihao Pan,Beier Zhu,Xiaofeng Yang,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Detail++提出了一种无需训练的框架，通过渐进式细节注入策略（PDI）解决复杂提示下多主体属性绑定的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成模型在处理复杂提示（尤其是多主体属性）时表现不佳，受人类绘画过程启发，提出分阶段生成方法。

Method: 将复杂提示分解为简化子提示，利用自注意力机制分阶段生成，并通过交叉注意力机制和质心对齐损失减少绑定噪声。

Result: 在T2I-CompBench和新构建的风格组合基准测试中，Detail++显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Detail++通过分阶段生成和属性绑定优化，有效提升了复杂提示下的图像生成质量。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) generation have led to impressive
visual results. However, these models still face significant challenges when
handling complex prompt, particularly those involving multiple subjects with
distinct attributes. Inspired by the human drawing process, which first
outlines the composition and then incrementally adds details, we propose
Detail++, a training-free framework that introduces a novel Progressive Detail
Injection (PDI) strategy to address this limitation. Specifically, we decompose
a complex prompt into a sequence of simplified sub-prompts, guiding the
generation process in stages. This staged generation leverages the inherent
layout-controlling capacity of self-attention to first ensure global
composition, followed by precise refinement. To achieve accurate binding
between attributes and corresponding subjects, we exploit cross-attention
mechanisms and further introduce a Centroid Alignment Loss at test time to
reduce binding noise and enhance attribute consistency. Extensive experiments
on T2I-CompBench and a newly constructed style composition benchmark
demonstrate that Detail++ significantly outperforms existing methods,
particularly in scenarios involving multiple objects and complex stylistic
conditions.

### [4] [FishDet-M: A Unified Large-Scale Benchmark for Robust Fish Detection and CLIP-Guided Model Selection in Diverse Aquatic Visual Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17859)
*Muayad Abujabal,Lyes Saad Saoud,Irfan Hussain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FishDet-M是一个统一的水下鱼类检测基准，整合了13个公开数据集，评估了28种目标检测模型，并提出了基于CLIP的模型选择框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决水下鱼类检测中数据集碎片化、成像条件不一致和评估协议不统一的问题。

Method: 整合13个数据集，使用COCO风格标注，评估28种模型（包括YOLO系列、R-CNN和DETR），并提出CLIP-based模型选择框架。

Result: 模型性能差异显著，CLIP-based选择框架在零样本条件下表现优异。

Conclusion: FishDet-M为水下计算机视觉提供了标准化平台，支持未来研究。

Abstract: Accurate fish detection in underwater imagery is essential for ecological
monitoring, aquaculture automation, and robotic perception. However, practical
deployment remains limited by fragmented datasets, heterogeneous imaging
conditions, and inconsistent evaluation protocols. To address these gaps, we
present \textit{FishDet-M}, the largest unified benchmark for fish detection,
comprising 13 publicly available datasets spanning diverse aquatic environments
including marine, brackish, occluded, and aquarium scenes. All data are
harmonized using COCO-style annotations with both bounding boxes and
segmentation masks, enabling consistent and scalable cross-domain evaluation.
We systematically benchmark 28 contemporary object detection models, covering
the YOLOv8 to YOLOv12 series, R-CNN based detectors, and DETR based models.
Evaluations are conducted using standard metrics including mAP, mAP@50, and
mAP@75, along with scale-specific analyses (AP$_S$, AP$_M$, AP$_L$) and
inference profiling in terms of latency and parameter count. The results
highlight the varying detection performance across models trained on FishDet-M,
as well as the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency across models of
different architectures. To support adaptive deployment, we introduce a
CLIP-based model selection framework that leverages vision-language alignment
to dynamically identify the most semantically appropriate detector for each
input image. This zero-shot selection strategy achieves high performance
without requiring ensemble computation, offering a scalable solution for
real-time applications. FishDet-M establishes a standardized and reproducible
platform for evaluating object detection in complex aquatic scenes. All
datasets, pretrained models, and evaluation tools are publicly available to
facilitate future research in underwater computer vision and intelligent marine
systems.

### [5] [Towards Facilitated Fairness Assessment of AI-based Skin Lesion Classifiers Through GenAI-based Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17860)
*Ko Watanabe. Stanislav Frolov. Adriano Lucieri. Andreas Dengel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了利用生成式AI（GenAI）评估皮肤癌分类器的公平性，发现合成数据在公平性评估中具有潜力，但需注意训练数据的匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在皮肤癌筛查中的应用潜力巨大，但存在潜在偏见问题，评估和改进公平性至关重要。

Method: 利用先进的生成式AI模型（LightningDiT）评估公开可用的黑色素瘤分类器的公平性。

Result: 合成数据在公平性评估中表现良好，但若评估模型与合成数据训练集不匹配，公平性验证会变得困难。

Conclusion: 研究提出了一种利用合成数据评估和改进医学影像AI系统公平性的新方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Deep Learning and its application on the edge hold
great potential for the revolution of routine screenings for skin cancers like
Melanoma. Along with the anticipated benefits of this technology, potential
dangers arise from unforseen and inherent biases. Thus, assessing and improving
the fairness of such systems is of utmost importance. A key challenge in
fairness assessment is to ensure that the evaluation dataset is sufficiently
representative of different Personal Identifiable Information (PII) (sex, age,
and race) and other minority groups. Against the backdrop of this challenge,
this study leverages the state-of-the-art Generative AI (GenAI) LightningDiT
model to assess the fairness of publicly available melanoma classifiers. The
results suggest that fairness assessment using highly realistic synthetic data
is a promising direction. Yet, our findings indicate that verifying fairness
becomes difficult when the melanoma-detection model used for evaluation is
trained on data that differ from the dataset underpinning the synthetic images.
Nonetheless, we propose that our approach offers a valuable new avenue for
employing synthetic data to gauge and enhance fairness in medical-imaging GenAI
systems.

### [6] [Improving Bird Classification with Primary Color Additives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18334)
*Ezhini Rasendiran R,Chandresh Kumar Maurya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过将频率信息嵌入到声谱图中，提出了一种改进鸟类物种分类的方法，显著提升了分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决鸟类鸣声分类中的环境噪声、重叠鸣叫和标签缺失问题，现有模型在低信噪比或多物种录音中表现不佳。

Method: 通过可视化鸟类的音高模式、速度和重复（称为motifs），并将频率信息嵌入声谱图中以增强物种区分。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在F1、ROC-AUC和CMAP指标上分别提升了7.3%、6.2%和6.6%，超越了BirdCLEF 2024的获胜模型。

Conclusion: 通过颜色化嵌入频率信息有效提升了鸟类物种分类的准确性。

Abstract: We address the problem of classifying bird species using their song
recordings, a challenging task due to environmental noise, overlapping
vocalizations, and missing labels. Existing models struggle with low-SNR or
multi-species recordings. We hypothesize that birds can be classified by
visualizing their pitch pattern, speed, and repetition, collectively called
motifs. Deep learning models applied to spectrogram images help, but similar
motifs across species cause confusion. To mitigate this, we embed frequency
information into spectrograms using primary color additives. This enhances
species distinction and improves classification accuracy. Our experiments show
that the proposed approach achieves statistically significant gains over models
without colorization and surpasses the BirdCLEF 2024 winner, improving F1 by
7.3%, ROC-AUC by 6.2%, and CMAP by 6.6%. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of incorporating frequency information via colorization.

### [7] [DiNAT-IR: Exploring Dilated Neighborhood Attention for High-Quality Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17892)
*Hanzhou Liu,Binghan Li,Chengkai Liu,Mi Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Transformer的图像修复方法DiNAT-IR，通过结合局部注意力和全局上下文，解决了传统方法在计算效率和局部细节上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer在图像修复任务中因自注意力机制的高计算成本而难以扩展至高分辨率图像，且现有方法可能忽略局部细节。

Method: 引入Dilated Neighborhood Attention (DiNA)结合滑动窗口注意力和混合膨胀因子，并加入通道感知模块以整合全局上下文。

Result: 提出的DiNAT-IR在多个基准测试中取得竞争性结果，为低层次计算机视觉问题提供了高质量解决方案。

Conclusion: DiNAT-IR通过平衡全局与局部信息，有效提升了图像修复的质量和效率。

Abstract: Transformers, with their self-attention mechanisms for modeling long-range
dependencies, have become a dominant paradigm in image restoration tasks.
However, the high computational cost of self-attention limits scalability to
high-resolution images, making efficiency-quality trade-offs a key research
focus. To address this, Restormer employs channel-wise self-attention, which
computes attention across channels instead of spatial dimensions. While
effective, this approach may overlook localized artifacts that are crucial for
high-quality image restoration. To bridge this gap, we explore Dilated
Neighborhood Attention (DiNA) as a promising alternative, inspired by its
success in high-level vision tasks. DiNA balances global context and local
precision by integrating sliding-window attention with mixed dilation factors,
effectively expanding the receptive field without excessive overhead. However,
our preliminary experiments indicate that directly applying this global-local
design to the classic deblurring task hinders accurate visual restoration,
primarily due to the constrained global context understanding within local
attention. To address this, we introduce a channel-aware module that
complements local attention, effectively integrating global context without
sacrificing pixel-level precision. The proposed DiNAT-IR, a Transformer-based
architecture specifically designed for image restoration, achieves competitive
results across multiple benchmarks, offering a high-quality solution for
diverse low-level computer vision problems.

### [8] [AFRDA: Attentive Feature Refinement for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17957)
*Md. Al-Masrur Khan,Durgakant Pushp,Lantao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自适应特征细化（AFR）模块，用于无监督域自适应语义分割（UDA-SS），通过结合高低分辨率特征和高频组件提升分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有UDA-SS方法难以平衡局部细节与全局上下文信息，导致复杂区域分割错误。

Method: AFR模块通过语义先验细化高分辨率特征，整合高频组件，并通过不确定性驱动注意力平衡局部与全局信息。

Result: 在GTA V→Cityscapes和Synthia→Cityscapes上分别提升1.05%和1.04%的mIoU。

Conclusion: AFR模块轻量且高效，可无缝集成到HRDA方法中，实现最先进的性能。

Abstract: In Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation (UDA-SS), a model is
trained on labeled source domain data (e.g., synthetic images) and adapted to
an unlabeled target domain (e.g., real-world images) without access to target
annotations. Existing UDA-SS methods often struggle to balance fine-grained
local details with global contextual information, leading to segmentation
errors in complex regions. To address this, we introduce the Adaptive Feature
Refinement (AFR) module, which enhances segmentation accuracy by refining
highresolution features using semantic priors from low-resolution logits. AFR
also integrates high-frequency components, which capture fine-grained
structures and provide crucial boundary information, improving object
delineation. Additionally, AFR adaptively balances local and global information
through uncertaintydriven attention, reducing misclassifications. Its
lightweight design allows seamless integration into HRDA-based UDA methods,
leading to state-of-the-art segmentation performance. Our approach improves
existing UDA-SS methods by 1.05% mIoU on GTA V --> Cityscapes and 1.04% mIoU on
Synthia-->Cityscapes. The implementation of our framework is available at:

### [9] [OPEN: A Benchmark Dataset and Baseline for Older Adult Patient Engagement Recognition in Virtual Rehabilitation Learning Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17959)
*Ali Abedi,Sadaf Safa,Tracey J. F. Colella,Shehroz S. Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文介绍了OPEN数据集，用于AI驱动的老年人虚拟学习参与度识别，包含多模态特征和标注，模型准确率达81%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚拟学习中参与度测量困难，尤其是老年人群数据稀缺，现有方法缺乏上下文和长期性分析。

Method: 收集11名老年人6周的虚拟康复数据，提取面部、手部和身体特征，标注参与度、情感和行为状态。

Result: 构建了OPEN数据集，训练模型实现81%的参与度识别准确率。

Conclusion: OPEN为老年人个性化参与度建模提供了可扩展的基础，推动了参与度识别研究。

Abstract: Engagement in virtual learning is essential for participant satisfaction,
performance, and adherence, particularly in online education and virtual
rehabilitation, where interactive communication plays a key role. Yet,
accurately measuring engagement in virtual group settings remains a challenge.
There is increasing interest in using artificial intelligence (AI) for
large-scale, real-world, automated engagement recognition. While engagement has
been widely studied in younger academic populations, research and datasets
focused on older adults in virtual and telehealth learning settings remain
limited. Existing methods often neglect contextual relevance and the
longitudinal nature of engagement across sessions. This paper introduces OPEN
(Older adult Patient ENgagement), a novel dataset supporting AI-driven
engagement recognition. It was collected from eleven older adults participating
in weekly virtual group learning sessions over six weeks as part of cardiac
rehabilitation, producing over 35 hours of data, making it the largest dataset
of its kind. To protect privacy, raw video is withheld; instead, the released
data include facial, hand, and body joint landmarks, along with affective and
behavioral features extracted from video. Annotations include binary engagement
states, affective and behavioral labels, and context-type indicators, such as
whether the instructor addressed the group or an individual. The dataset offers
versions with 5-, 10-, 30-second, and variable-length samples. To demonstrate
utility, multiple machine learning and deep learning models were trained,
achieving engagement recognition accuracy of up to 81 percent. OPEN provides a
scalable foundation for personalized engagement modeling in aging populations
and contributes to broader engagement recognition research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于YOLO模型的自动化系统，用于实时监测鬃狮蜥的行为，包括晒太阳和捕食。YOLOv8s表现最佳，但捕食检测因蟋蟀识别较弱而不够准确。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监测鬃狮蜥行为的方法耗时且易出错，需要一种高效、自动化的解决方案。

Method: 使用五种YOLO变体（v5-v12）在1200张自定义图像上训练，通过帧间坐标提取、时间插值和基于规则的逻辑分类行为。

Result: YOLOv8s在准确性和速度上表现最佳（mAP@0.5:0.95=0.855），但蟋蟀检测较弱（mAP@0.5=0.392）影响了捕食行为分类。

Conclusion: 自动化系统显著提升了研究效率，未来需改进蟋蟀检测以优化捕食行为分类。

Abstract: Traditional monitoring of bearded dragon (Pogona Viticeps) behaviour is
time-consuming and prone to errors. This project introduces an automated system
for real-time video analysis, using You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection
models to identify two key behaviours: basking and hunting. We trained five
YOLO variants (v5, v7, v8, v11, v12) on a custom, publicly available dataset of
1200 images, encompassing bearded dragons (600), heating lamps (500), and
crickets (100). YOLOv8s was selected as the optimal model due to its superior
balance of accuracy (mAP@0.5:0.95 = 0.855) and speed. The system processes
video footage by extracting per-frame object coordinates, applying temporal
interpolation for continuity, and using rule-based logic to classify specific
behaviours. Basking detection proved reliable. However, hunting detection was
less accurate, primarily due to weak cricket detection (mAP@0.5 = 0.392).
Future improvements will focus on enhancing cricket detection through expanded
datasets or specialised small-object detectors. This automated system offers a
scalable solution for monitoring reptile behaviour in controlled environments,
significantly improving research efficiency and data quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了首个空中-地面跨模态视频行人重识别数据集AG-VPReID.VIR，并设计了TCC-VPReID三流架构解决跨平台和跨模态的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集主要关注地面视角，存在遮挡、覆盖范围有限等问题，而空中视角能解决这些问题。

Method: 引入AG-VPReID.VIR数据集，并提出TCC-VPReID三流架构，通过风格鲁棒特征学习、基于记忆的跨视角适应和中介引导的时间建模来弥合领域差距。

Conclusion: AG-VPReID.VIR和TCC-VPReID为跨模态行人重识别提供了新基准和解决方案。

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) across visible and infrared modalities is
crucial for 24-hour surveillance systems, but existing datasets primarily focus
on ground-level perspectives. While ground-based IR systems offer nighttime
capabilities, they suffer from occlusions, limited coverage, and vulnerability
to obstructions--problems that aerial perspectives uniquely solve. To address
these limitations, we introduce AG-VPReID.VIR, the first aerial-ground
cross-modality video-based person Re-ID dataset. This dataset captures 1,837
identities across 4,861 tracklets (124,855 frames) using both UAV-mounted and
fixed CCTV cameras in RGB and infrared modalities. AG-VPReID.VIR presents
unique challenges including cross-viewpoint variations, modality discrepancies,
and temporal dynamics. Additionally, we propose TCC-VPReID, a novel
three-stream architecture designed to address the joint challenges of
cross-platform and cross-modality person Re-ID. Our approach bridges the domain
gaps between aerial-ground perspectives and RGB-IR modalities, through
style-robust feature learning, memory-based cross-view adaptation, and
intermediary-guided temporal modeling. Experiments show that AG-VPReID.VIR
presents distinctive challenges compared to existing datasets, with our
TCC-VPReID framework achieving significant performance gains across multiple
evaluation protocols. Dataset and code are available at

*Emma A. M. Stanley,Raghav Mehta,Mélanie Roschewitz,Nils D. Forkert,Ben Glocker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究了医学影像数据中标签偏差对深度学习模型特征学习和性能的影响，发现偏差子群的大小和可分离性显著影响模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨医学影像数据中特定子群的系统性标签偏差（即标签偏差）对医学AI系统公平性的影响。

Method: 使用EMBED数据集训练深度学习模型进行二元组织密度分类，模拟可分离和不可分离子群的标签偏差。

Result: 标签偏差导致模型特征表示显著偏移，且偏移程度取决于子群大小和可分离性；验证集标签是否干净显著影响子群性能。

Conclusion: 标签偏差对医学影像AI子群公平性有重要影响，需关注偏差子群的特性和验证集标签质量。

Abstract: Systematic mislabelling affecting specific subgroups (i.e., label bias) in
medical imaging datasets represents an understudied issue concerning the
fairness of medical AI systems. In this work, we investigated how size and
separability of subgroups affected by label bias influence the learned features
and performance of a deep learning model. Therefore, we trained deep learning
models for binary tissue density classification using the EMory BrEast imaging
Dataset (EMBED), where label bias affected separable subgroups (based on
imaging manufacturer) or non-separable "pseudo-subgroups". We found that
simulated subgroup label bias led to prominent shifts in the learned feature
representations of the models. Importantly, these shifts within the feature
space were dependent on both the relative size and the separability of the
subgroup affected by label bias. We also observed notable differences in
subgroup performance depending on whether a validation set with clean labels
was used to define the classification threshold for the model. For instance,
with label bias affecting the majority separable subgroup, the true positive
rate for that subgroup fell from 0.898, when the validation set had clean
labels, to 0.518, when the validation set had biased labels. Our work
represents a key contribution toward understanding the consequences of label
bias on subgroup fairness in medical imaging AI.

### [13] [Registration beyond Points: General Affine Subspace Alignment via Geodesic Distance on Grassmann Manifold](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17998)
*Jaeho Shin,Hyeonjae Gil,Junwoo Jang,Maani Ghaffari,Ayoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文首次推导了基于刚性变换的可优化Grassmannian特征距离函数，并提出了适用于配准问题的优化成本函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法将Grassmannian特征的距离表示为刚性变换的显式函数，限制了其在配准问题中的应用。

Method: 通过数学证明，利用高维线性子空间的基作为成本的显式表示，并基于变换基提出可优化成本函数。

Result: 提出的方法能够直接最小化测地距离，优于基于向量参数的方法，并在计算机视觉任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 本文的方法为Grassmannian特征的配准问题提供了全局最优解，并显著提升了现有解决方案的性能。

Abstract: Affine Grassmannian has been favored for expressing proximity between lines
and planes due to its theoretical exactness in measuring distances among
features. Despite this advantage, the existing method can only measure the
proximity without yielding the distance as an explicit function of rigid body
transformation. Thus, an optimizable distance function on the manifold has
remained underdeveloped, stifling its application in registration problems.
This paper is the first to explicitly derive an optimizable cost function
between two Grassmannian features with respect to rigid body transformation
($\mathbf{R}$ and $\mathbf{t}$). Specifically, we present a rigorous
mathematical proof demonstrating that the bases of high-dimensional linear
subspaces can serve as an explicit representation of the cost. Finally, we
propose an optimizable cost function based on the transformed bases that can be
applied to the registration problem of any affine subspace. Compared to vector
parameter-based approaches, our method is able to find a globally optimal
solution by directly minimizing the geodesic distance which is agnostic to
representation ambiguity. The resulting cost function and its extension to the
inlier-set maximizing \ac{BnB} solver have been demonstrated to improve the
convergence of existing solutions or outperform them in various computer vision
tasks. The code is available on

Conclusion: GRR-CoCa的改进架构在多模态任务中表现出更好的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) image and text generation models are multimodal
models that have many similarities to large language models (LLMs). Despite
achieving strong performances, leading foundational multimodal model
architectures frequently lag behind the architectural sophistication of
contemporary LLMs. We propose GRR-CoCa, an improved SOTA Contrastive Captioner
(CoCa) model that incorporates Gaussian error gated linear units, root mean
squared normalization, and rotary positional embedding into the textual
decoders and the vision transformer (ViT) encoder. Each architectural
modification has been shown to improve model performance in LLMs, but has yet
to be adopted in CoCa. We benchmarked GRR-CoCa against Baseline CoCa, a model
with the same modified textual decoders but with CoCa's original ViT encoder.
We used standard pretraining and fine-tuning workflows to benchmark the models
on contrastive and generative tasks. Our GRR-CoCa significantly outperformed
Baseline CoCa on the pretraining dataset and three diverse fine-tuning
datasets. Pretraining improvements were 27.25% in contrastive loss, 3.71% in
perplexity, and 7.15% in CoCa loss. The average fine-tuning improvements were
13.66% in contrastive loss, 5.18% in perplexity, and 5.55% in CoCa loss. We
show that GRR-CoCa's modified architecture improves performance and
generalization across vision-language domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI技术的快速发展导致DeepFake视频类型多样化，现有数据集缺乏多样性，无法支持泛化性检测模型的开发。

Method: 基于Celeb-DF数据集，构建了Celeb-DF++数据集，包含三种常见伪造场景（Face-swap、Face-reenactment、Talking-face），使用22种不同方法生成高质量伪造视频。

Result: Celeb-DF++数据集覆盖了多种DeepFake类型，并评估了24种检测方法的泛化性，揭示了现有方法的局限性。

Conclusion: Celeb-DF++为泛化性检测提供了挑战性基准，强调了开发更强大检测方法的必要性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI technologies has significantly increased the
diversity of DeepFake videos circulating online, posing a pressing challenge
for \textit{generalizable forensics}, \ie, detecting a wide range of unseen
DeepFake types using a single model. Addressing this challenge requires
datasets that are not only large-scale but also rich in forgery diversity.
However, most existing datasets, despite their scale, include only a limited
variety of forgery types, making them insufficient for developing generalizable
detection methods. Therefore, we build upon our earlier Celeb-DF dataset and
introduce {Celeb-DF++}, a new large-scale and challenging video DeepFake
benchmark dedicated to the generalizable forensics challenge. Celeb-DF++ covers
three commonly encountered forgery scenarios: Face-swap (FS), Face-reenactment
(FR), and Talking-face (TF). Each scenario contains a substantial number of
high-quality forged videos, generated using a total of 22 various recent
DeepFake methods. These methods differ in terms of architectures, generation
pipelines, and targeted facial regions, covering the most prevalent DeepFake
cases witnessed in the wild. We also introduce evaluation protocols for
measuring the generalizability of 24 recent detection methods, highlighting the
limitations of existing detection methods and the difficulty of our new
dataset.

Motivation: 现有的3D场景修复方法在处理不规则结构和多视角一致性方面存在挑战，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 结合自动掩模优化（高斯场景过滤和反向投影）和不确定性引导的细粒度优化策略，修复稀疏视角下的3D场景。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法在视觉质量和视角一致性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为3D场景修复提供了一种高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-view 3D reconstruction and novel-view synthesis,
particularly through Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS), have greatly enhanced the fidelity and efficiency of 3D content
creation. However, inpainting 3D scenes remains a challenging task due to the
inherent irregularity of 3D structures and the critical need for maintaining
multi-view consistency. In this work, we propose a novel 3D Gaussian inpainting
framework that reconstructs complete 3D scenes by leveraging sparse inpainted
views. Our framework incorporates an automatic Mask Refinement Process and
region-wise Uncertainty-guided Optimization. Specifically, we refine the
inpainting mask using a series of operations, including Gaussian scene
filtering and back-projection, enabling more accurate localization of occluded
regions and realistic boundary restoration. Furthermore, our Uncertainty-guided
Fine-grained Optimization strategy, which estimates the importance of each
region across multi-view images during training, alleviates multi-view
inconsistencies and enhances the fidelity of fine details in the inpainted
results. Comprehensive experiments conducted on diverse datasets demonstrate
that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual
quality and view consistency.

Conclusion: 讨论了情感识别在心理健康评估中的应用（如抑郁和自闭症检测）以及未来研究方向。

Abstract: Emotion recognition through body movements has emerged as a compelling and
privacy-preserving alternative to traditional methods that rely on facial
expressions or physiological signals. Recent advancements in 3D skeleton
acquisition technologies and pose estimation algorithms have significantly
enhanced the feasibility of emotion recognition based on full-body motion. This
survey provides a comprehensive and systematic review of skeleton-based emotion
recognition techniques. First, we introduce psychological models of emotion and
examine the relationship between bodily movements and emotional expression.
Next, we summarize publicly available datasets, highlighting the differences in
data acquisition methods and emotion labeling strategies. We then categorize
existing methods into posture-based and gait-based approaches, analyzing them
from both data-driven and technical perspectives. In particular, we propose a
unified taxonomy that encompasses four primary technical paradigms: Traditional
approaches, Feat2Net, FeatFusionNet, and End2EndNet. Representative works
within each category are reviewed and compared, with benchmarking results
across commonly used datasets. Finally, we explore the extended applications of
emotion recognition in mental health assessment, such as detecting depression
and autism, and discuss the open challenges and future research directions in
this rapidly evolving field.

Motivation: 深度伪造技术威胁媒体真实性，传统检测方法在泛化和对抗恶意攻击方面表现不足。

Method: ViGText将图像分块，构建图文图，利用图神经网络进行多级特征提取和分析。

Result: ViGText在泛化测试中F1分数从72.45%提升至98.32%，召回率提高11.1%，对抗攻击时性能下降小于4%。

Conclusion: ViGText通过详细视觉和文本分析，为深度伪造检测设定了新标准，保障媒体真实性和信息完整性。

Abstract: The rapid rise of deepfake technology, which produces realistic but
fraudulent digital content, threatens the authenticity of media. Traditional
deepfake detection approaches often struggle with sophisticated, customized
deepfakes, especially in terms of generalization and robustness against
malicious attacks. This paper introduces ViGText, a novel approach that
integrates images with Vision Large Language Model (VLLM) Text explanations
within a Graph-based framework to improve deepfake detection. The novelty of
ViGText lies in its integration of detailed explanations with visual data, as
it provides a more context-aware analysis than captions, which often lack
specificity and fail to reveal subtle inconsistencies. ViGText systematically
divides images into patches, constructs image and text graphs, and integrates
them for analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify deepfakes.
Through the use of multi-level feature extraction across spatial and frequency
domains, ViGText captures details that enhance its robustness and accuracy to
detect sophisticated deepfakes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViGText
significantly enhances generalization and achieves a notable performance boost
when it detects user-customized deepfakes. Specifically, average F1 scores rise
from 72.45% to 98.32% under generalization evaluation, and reflects the model's
superior ability to generalize to unseen, fine-tuned variations of stable
diffusion models. As for robustness, ViGText achieves an increase of 11.1% in
recall compared to other deepfake detection approaches. When facing targeted
attacks that exploit its graph-based architecture, ViGText limits
classification performance degradation to less than 4%. ViGText uses detailed
visual and textual analysis to set a new standard for detecting deepfakes,
helping ensure media authenticity and information integrity.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合Dual-Scale-Former（DSFormer）和块聚类策略的新框架，用于提升视觉地点识别（VPR）的鲁棒性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉地点识别在移动机器人定位中至关重要，但在环境变化和视角变化下性能不稳定。

Result: 在多数基准数据集上达到最优性能，减少30%训练数据需求，提升计算效率。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了VPR的鲁棒性和效率，适用于环境变化和视角变化场景。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is crucial for robust mobile robot
localization, yet it faces significant challenges in maintaining reliable
performance under varying environmental conditions and viewpoints. To address
this, we propose a novel framework that integrates Dual-Scale-Former
(DSFormer), a Transformer-based cross-learning module, with an innovative block
clustering strategy. DSFormer enhances feature representation by enabling
bidirectional information transfer between dual-scale features extracted from
the final two CNN layers, capturing both semantic richness and spatial details
through self-attention for long-range dependencies within each scale and shared
cross-attention for cross-scale learning. Complementing this, our block
clustering strategy repartitions the widely used San Francisco eXtra Large
(SF-XL) training dataset from multiple distinct perspectives, optimizing data
organization to further bolster robustness against viewpoint variations.
Together, these innovations not only yield a robust global embedding adaptable
to environmental changes but also reduce the required training data volume by
approximately 30\% compared to previous partitioning methods. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
across most benchmark datasets, surpassing advanced reranking methods like
DELG, Patch-NetVLAD, TransVPR, and R2Former as a global retrieval solution
using 512-dim global descriptors, while significantly improving computational
efficiency.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TAV的数据集，用于提升AI生成视频中场景转换的连贯性，解决了当前模型在多场景视频生成中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI生成视频模型在单场景短片段上表现良好，但在多场景长视频中缺乏连贯的场景转换能力，主要因为无法从提示中推断何时需要转换。

Method: 提出了Transition-Aware Video (TAV)数据集，包含多场景转换的视频片段，并通过后训练提升模型的场景转换理解能力。

Result: 实验表明，使用TAV数据集后训练能改善场景转换理解，缩小生成场景与需求场景的差距，同时保持图像质量。

Conclusion: TAV数据集为多场景视频生成提供了有效解决方案，提升了模型的场景转换能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated video have shown strong performance on
\emph{text-to-video} tasks, particularly for short clips depicting a single
scene. However, current models struggle to generate longer videos with coherent
scene transitions, primarily because they cannot infer when a transition is
needed from the prompt. Most open-source models are trained on datasets
consisting of single-scene video clips, which limits their capacity to learn
and respond to prompts requiring multiple scenes. Developing scene transition
awareness is essential for multi-scene generation, as it allows models to
identify and segment videos into distinct clips by accurately detecting
transitions.
  To address this, we propose the \textbf{Transition-Aware Video} (TAV)
dataset, which consists of preprocessed video clips with multiple scene
transitions. Our experiment shows that post-training on the \textbf{TAV}
dataset improves prompt-based scene transition understanding, narrows the gap
between required and generated scenes, and maintains image quality.

Conclusion: 通过合成具有透明度的真实前景，解决了可扩展配对数据不足的问题，平衡了真实性和场景多样性。

Abstract: We introduce BokehDiff, a novel lens blur rendering method that achieves
physically accurate and visually appealing outcomes, with the help of
generative diffusion prior. Previous methods are bounded by the accuracy of
depth estimation, generating artifacts in depth discontinuities. Our method
employs a physics-inspired self-attention module that aligns with the image
formation process, incorporating depth-dependent circle of confusion constraint
and self-occlusion effects. We adapt the diffusion model to the one-step
inference scheme without introducing additional noise, and achieve results of
high quality and fidelity. To address the lack of scalable paired data, we
propose to synthesize photorealistic foregrounds with transparency with
diffusion models, balancing authenticity and scene diversity.

Result: 在多样场景实验中，VLM-IMI在定量指标和感知质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VLM-IMI通过语义指导和动态融合，显著提升了低光图像增强的效果。

Abstract: Most existing low-light image enhancement (LLIE) methods rely on pre-trained
model priors, low-light inputs, or both, while neglecting the semantic guidance
available from normal-light images. This limitation hinders their effectiveness
in complex lighting conditions. In this paper, we propose VLM-IMI, a novel
framework that leverages large vision-language models (VLMs) with iterative and
manual instructions (IMIs) for LLIE. VLM-IMI incorporates textual descriptions
of the desired normal-light content as enhancement cues, enabling semantically
informed restoration. To effectively integrate cross-modal priors, we introduce
an instruction prior fusion module, which dynamically aligns and fuses image
and text features, promoting the generation of detailed and semantically
coherent outputs. During inference, we adopt an iterative and manual
instruction strategy to refine textual instructions, progressively improving
visual quality. This refinement enhances structural fidelity, semantic
alignment, and the recovery of fine details under extremely low-light
conditions. Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate that
VLM-IMI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and
perceptual quality. The source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺癌预后差，EUS图像分割因噪声和低对比度而困难，现有方法依赖大量标注数据。

Method: 结合BiomedCLIP文本编码器和LoRA架构调整，仅需调整0.86%参数，实现自动分割。

Result: 在公开数据集上，Dice达82.69%，NSD达85.28%，优于现有SOTA模型。

Conclusion: TextSAM-EUS为EUS图像分割提供了高效、鲁棒的解决方案，首次将提示学习引入SAM医学图像分割。

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer carries a poor prognosis and relies on endoscopic
ultrasound (EUS) for targeted biopsy and radiotherapy. However, the speckle
noise, low contrast, and unintuitive appearance of EUS make segmentation of
pancreatic tumors with fully supervised deep learning (DL) models both
error-prone and dependent on large, expert-curated annotation datasets. To
address these challenges, we present TextSAM-EUS, a novel, lightweight,
text-driven adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) that requires no
manual geometric prompts at inference. Our approach leverages text prompt
learning (context optimization) through the BiomedCLIP text encoder in
conjunction with a LoRA-based adaptation of SAM's architecture to enable
automatic pancreatic tumor segmentation in EUS, tuning only 0.86% of the total
parameters. On the public Endoscopic Ultrasound Database of the Pancreas,
TextSAM-EUS with automatic prompts attains 82.69% Dice and 85.28% normalized
surface distance (NSD), and with manual geometric prompts reaches 83.10% Dice
and 85.70% NSD, outperforming both existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) supervised
DL models and foundation models (e.g., SAM and its variants). As the first
attempt to incorporate prompt learning in SAM-based medical image segmentation,
TextSAM-EUS offers a practical option for efficient and robust automatic EUS
segmentation. Our code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize relevant temporal segments in
videos given natural language queries. Despite recent progress with large
vision-language models (LVLMs) and instruction-tuning, existing approaches
often suffer from limited temporal awareness and poor generalization. In this
work, we introduce a two-stage training framework that integrates supervised
fine-tuning with reinforcement learning (RL) to improve both the accuracy and
robustness of VTG models. Our approach first leverages high-quality curated
cold start data for SFT initialization, followed by difficulty-controlled RL to
further enhance temporal localization and reasoning abilities. Comprehensive
experiments on multiple VTG benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing models, particularly in challenging and open-domain
scenarios. We conduct an in-depth analysis of training strategies and dataset
curation, highlighting the importance of both high-quality cold start data and
difficulty-controlled RL. To facilitate further research and industrial
adoption, we release all intermediate datasets, models, and code to the
community.

Conclusion: 该模型成功捕捉了刺激和神经响应的长时程结构，为脑活动预测提供了新方法。

Abstract: The Algonauts 2025 Challenge called on the community to develop encoding
models that predict whole-brain fMRI responses to naturalistic multimodal
movies. In this submission, we propose a sequence-to-sequence Transformer that
autoregressively predicts fMRI activity from visual, auditory, and language
inputs. Stimulus features were extracted using pretrained models including
VideoMAE, HuBERT, Qwen, and BridgeTower. The decoder integrates information
from prior brain states, current stimuli, and episode-level summaries via dual
cross-attention mechanisms that attend to both perceptual information extracted
from the stimulus as well as narrative information provided by high-level
summaries of narrative content. One core innovation of our approach is the use
of sequences of multimodal context to predict sequences of brain activity,
enabling the model to capture long-range temporal structure in both stimuli and
neural responses. Another is the combination of a shared encoder with partial
subject-specific decoder, which leverages common structure across subjects
while accounting for individual variability. Our model achieves strong
performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, demonstrating
the effectiveness of temporally-aware, multimodal sequence modeling for brain
activity prediction. The code is available at

Motivation: 传统方法如MC Dropout仅关注模型或数据不确定性，未能与OoD检测的语义目标对齐，因此需要一种更全面的方法。

Method: 提出自由能后验网络，结合Beta分布的自由能密度估计器和后验网络中的损失函数，直接从不需随机采样的学习参数中估计不确定性。

Result: 在Fishyscapes、RoadAnomaly和Segment-Me-If-You-Can等基准上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过Beta分布的方差学习OoD区域，提供了语义明确且计算高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating uncertainty from deep neural networks is a widely used approach
for detecting out-of-distribution (OoD) samples, which typically exhibit high
predictive uncertainty. However, conventional methods such as Monte Carlo (MC)
Dropout often focus solely on either model or data uncertainty, failing to
align with the semantic objective of OoD detection. To address this, we propose
the Free-Energy Posterior Network, a novel framework that jointly models
distributional uncertainty and identifying OoD and misclassified regions using
free energy. Our method introduces two key contributions: (1) a
free-energy-based density estimator parameterized by a Beta distribution, which
enables fine-grained uncertainty estimation near ambiguous or unseen regions;
and (2) a loss integrated within a posterior network, allowing direct
uncertainty estimation from learned parameters without requiring stochastic
sampling. By integrating our approach with the residual prediction branch (RPL)
framework, the proposed method goes beyond post-hoc energy thresholding and
enables the network to learn OoD regions by leveraging the variance of the Beta
distribution, resulting in a semantically meaningful and computationally
efficient solution for uncertainty-aware segmentation. We validate the
effectiveness of our method on challenging real-world benchmarks, including
Fishyscapes, RoadAnomaly, and Segment-Me-If-You-Can.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) models have shown remarkable performance in generating
visually reasonable scenes, while their capability to leverage world knowledge
for ensuring semantic consistency and factual accuracy remains largely
understudied. In response to this challenge, we propose T2VWorldBench, the
first systematic evaluation framework for evaluating the world knowledge
generation abilities of text-to-video models, covering 6 major categories, 60

physics, nature, activity, culture, causality, and object. To address both
human preference and scalable evaluation, our benchmark incorporates both human
evaluation and automated evaluation using vision-language models (VLMs). We
evaluated the 10 most advanced text-to-video models currently available,
ranging from open source to commercial models, and found that most models are
unable to understand world knowledge and generate truly correct videos. These
findings point out a critical gap in the capability of current text-to-video

Abstract: In the medical image analysis field, precise quantification of curve
tortuosity plays a critical role in the auxiliary diagnosis and pathological
assessment of various diseases. In this study, we propose a novel framework for
tortuosity quantification and demonstrate its effectiveness through the
evaluation of meibomian gland atrophy uniformity,serving as a representative
application scenario.
  We introduce an information entropy-based tortuosity quantification framework
that integrates probability modeling with entropy theory and incorporates
domain transformation of curve data. Unlike traditional methods such as
curvature or arc-chord ratio, this approach evaluates the tortuosity of a
target curve by comparing it to a designated reference curve. Consequently, it
is more suitable for tortuosity assessment tasks in medical data where
biologically plausible reference curves are available, providing a more robust
and objective evaluation metric without relying on idealized straight-line
comparisons.
  First, we conducted numerical simulation experiments to preliminarily assess
the stability and validity of the method. Subsequently, the framework was
applied to quantify the spatial uniformity of meibomian gland atrophy and to
analyze the difference in this uniformity between \textit{Demodex}-negative and
\textit{Demodex}-positive patient groups. The results demonstrated a
significant difference in tortuosity-based uniformity between the two groups,
with an area under the curve of 0.8768, sensitivity of 0.75, and specificity of
0.93. These findings highlight the clinical utility of the proposed framework
in curve tortuosity analysis and its potential as a generalizable tool for
quantitative morphological evaluation in medical diagnostics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种双向扩散优化机制，通过联合建模低光和正常光图像的退化过程，提升图像增强质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有扩散方法因单向建模退化而难以捕捉真实世界退化模式的问题。

Method: 采用双向扩散（低光到正常光、正常光到低光）训练，引入自适应特征交互块（AFI）和反射感知校正模块（RACM）。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上定量和定性评估均优于现有方法，泛化能力强。

Conclusion: 双向扩散机制和辅助模块显著提升了低光图像增强的效果，更符合人类视觉感知。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement aims to improve the visibility of degraded images
to better align with human visual perception. While diffusion-based methods
have shown promising performance due to their strong generative capabilities.
However, their unidirectional modelling of degradation often struggles to
capture the complexity of real-world degradation patterns, leading to
structural inconsistencies and pixel misalignments. To address these
challenges, we propose a bidirectional diffusion optimization mechanism that
jointly models the degradation processes of both low-light and normal-light
images, enabling more precise degradation parameter matching and enhancing
generation quality. Specifically, we perform bidirectional diffusion-from
low-to-normal light and from normal-to-low light during training and introduce
an adaptive feature interaction block (AFI) to refine feature representation.
By leveraging the complementarity between these two paths, our approach imposes
an implicit symmetry constraint on illumination attenuation and noise
distribution, facilitating consistent degradation learning and improving the
models ability to perceive illumination and detail degradation. Additionally,
we design a reflection-aware correction module (RACM) to guide color
restoration post-denoising and suppress overexposed regions, ensuring content
consistency and generating high-quality images that align with human visual
perception. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and
qualitative evaluations while generalizing effectively to diverse degradation
scenarios. Code at https://github.com/hejh8/BidDiff

Result: 在四个基准测试中平均mAP提升4.5%，超越现有最优方法。

Conclusion: WaveMamba通过高效融合RGB和IR图像的频率特征，显著提升了目标检测性能。

Abstract: Leveraging the complementary characteristics of visible (RGB) and infrared
(IR) imagery offers significant potential for improving object detection. In
this paper, we propose WaveMamba, a cross-modality fusion method that
efficiently integrates the unique and complementary frequency features of RGB
and IR decomposed by Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). An improved detection
head incorporating the Inverse Discrete Wavelet Transform (IDWT) is also
proposed to reduce information loss and produce the final detection results.
The core of our approach is the introduction of WaveMamba Fusion Block (WMFB),
which facilitates comprehensive fusion across low-/high-frequency sub-bands.
Within WMFB, the Low-frequency Mamba Fusion Block (LMFB), built upon the Mamba
framework, first performs initial low-frequency feature fusion with channel
swapping, followed by deep fusion with an advanced gated attention mechanism
for enhanced integration. High-frequency features are enhanced using a strategy
that applies an ``absolute maximum" fusion approach. These advancements lead to
significant performance gains, with our method surpassing state-of-the-art
approaches and achieving average mAP improvements of 4.5% on four benchmarks.

such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Single Shot Detectors (SSDs), and
You Only Look Once (YOLO) have demonstrated high performance in terms of

Conclusion: 结合对比预训练和精细化集成伪标签，能有效解决复杂域差距问题，无需目标域标注。

Abstract: Addressing performance degradation in 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation due to
domain shifts (e.g., sensor type, geographical location) is crucial for
autonomous systems, yet manual annotation of target data is prohibitive. This
study addresses the challenge using Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) and
introduces a novel two-stage framework to tackle it. Initially, unsupervised
contrastive learning at the segment level is used to pre-train a backbone
network, enabling it to learn robust, domain-invariant features without labels.
Subsequently, a multi-model pseudo-labeling strategy is introduced, utilizing
an ensemble of diverse state-of-the-art architectures (including projection,
voxel, hybrid, and cylinder-based methods). Predictions from these models are
aggregated via hard voting to generate high-quality, refined pseudo-labels for
the unlabeled target domain, mitigating single-model biases. The contrastively
pre-trained network is then fine-tuned using these robust pseudo-labels.
Experiments adapting from SemanticKITTI to unlabeled target datasets
(SemanticPOSS, SemanticSlamantic) demonstrate significant improvements in
segmentation accuracy compared to direct transfer and single-model UDA
approaches. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining contrastive
pre-training with refined ensemble pseudo-labeling for bridging complex domain
gaps without requiring target domain annotations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习在数据稀缺场景中因过拟合噪声和无关模式而泛化能力受限的问题。

Method: 提出Diff-UMamba架构，集成UNet和mamba机制，并引入噪声抑制模块（NRM）过滤无关激活。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上表现优于基线方法1-3%，在低数据条件下提升4-5%。

Conclusion: Diff-UMamba在医学图像分割中显著提升准确性和鲁棒性，尤其适用于数据稀缺场景。

Abstract: In data-scarce scenarios, deep learning models often overfit to noise and
irrelevant patterns, which limits their ability to generalize to unseen
samples. To address these challenges in medical image segmentation, we
introduce Diff-UMamba, a novel architecture that combines the UNet framework
with the mamba mechanism for modeling long-range dependencies. At the heart of
Diff-UMamba is a Noise Reduction Module (NRM), which employs a signal
differencing strategy to suppress noisy or irrelevant activations within the
encoder. This encourages the model to filter out spurious features and enhance
task-relevant representations, thereby improving its focus on clinically
meaningful regions. As a result, the architecture achieves improved
segmentation accuracy and robustness, particularly in low-data settings.
Diff-UMamba is evaluated on multiple public datasets, including MSD (lung and
pancreas) and AIIB23, demonstrating consistent performance gains of 1-3% over
baseline methods across diverse segmentation tasks. To further assess
performance under limited-data conditions, additional experiments are conducted
on the BraTS-21 dataset by varying the proportion of available training
samples. The approach is also validated on a small internal non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) dataset for gross tumor volume (GTV) segmentation in cone beam
CT (CBCT), where it achieves a 4-5% improvement over the baseline.

TL;DR: MatSSL是一种简化的自监督学习架构，通过门控特征融合整合多级表示，适用于小规模未标注数据，在金属材料显微图像分析中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前金属材料的显微图像分析依赖监督方法，需针对每个新数据集重新训练，且标注样本少时性能不稳定。自监督学习虽有望解决此问题，但现有方法通常依赖大规模数据集。MatSSL旨在克服这一限制。

Method: MatSSL采用门控特征融合整合多级表示，先在小规模未标注数据上进行自监督预训练，再在多个基准数据集上微调模型。

Result: 在MetalDAM数据集上达到69.13% mIoU，优于ImageNet预训练编码器的66.73%；在EBC数据集上平均mIoU提升近40%。

Conclusion: MatSSL仅需少量未标注数据即可有效适应金属材料领域，同时保留从大规模自然图像预训练中学到的丰富可迁移特征。

Abstract: MatSSL is a streamlined self-supervised learning (SSL) architecture that
employs Gated Feature Fusion at each stage of the backbone to integrate
multi-level representations effectively. Current micrograph analysis of
metallic materials relies on supervised methods, which require retraining for
each new dataset and often perform inconsistently with only a few labeled
samples. While SSL offers a promising alternative by leveraging unlabeled data,
most existing methods still depend on large-scale datasets to be effective.
MatSSL is designed to overcome this limitation. We first perform
self-supervised pretraining on a small-scale, unlabeled dataset and then
fine-tune the model on multiple benchmark datasets. The resulting segmentation
models achieve 69.13% mIoU on MetalDAM, outperforming the 66.73% achieved by an
ImageNet-pretrained encoder, and delivers consistently up to nearly 40%
improvement in average mIoU on the Environmental Barrier Coating benchmark
dataset (EBC) compared to models pretrained with MicroNet. This suggests that
MatSSL enables effective adaptation to the metallographic domain using only a
small amount of unlabeled data, while preserving the rich and transferable
features learned from large-scale pretraining on natural images.

Conclusion: TeEFusion在保持高质量生成的同时，显著提升了效率，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image synthesis largely benefit from sophisticated
sampling strategies and classifier-free guidance (CFG) to ensure high-quality
generation. However, CFG's reliance on two forward passes, especially when
combined with intricate sampling algorithms, results in prohibitively high
inference costs. To address this, we introduce TeEFusion (\textbf{Te}xt
\textbf{E}mbeddings \textbf{Fusion}), a novel and efficient distillation method
that directly incorporates the guidance magnitude into the text embeddings and
distills the teacher model's complex sampling strategy. By simply fusing
conditional and unconditional text embeddings using linear operations,
TeEFusion reconstructs the desired guidance without adding extra parameters,
simultaneously enabling the student model to learn from the teacher's output
produced via its sophisticated sampling approach. Extensive experiments on
state-of-the-art models such as SD3 demonstrate that our method allows the
student to closely mimic the teacher's performance with a far simpler and more
efficient sampling strategy. Consequently, the student model achieves inference
speeds up to 6$\times$ faster than the teacher model, while maintaining image
quality at levels comparable to those obtained through the teacher's complex
sampling approach. The code is publicly available at

Conclusion: LEAF高效且不改动模型架构，适用于医学图像分割任务。

Abstract: Leveraging the powerful capabilities of diffusion models has yielded quite
effective results in medical image segmentation tasks. However, existing
methods typically transfer the original training process directly without
specific adjustments for segmentation tasks. Furthermore, the commonly used
pre-trained diffusion models still have deficiencies in feature extraction.
Based on these considerations, we propose LEAF, a medical image segmentation
model grounded in latent diffusion models. During the fine-tuning process, we
replace the original noise prediction pattern with a direct prediction of the
segmentation map, thereby reducing the variance of segmentation results. We
also employ a feature distillation method to align the hidden states of the
convolutional layers with the features from a transformer-based vision encoder.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method enhances the performance of
the original diffusion model across multiple segmentation datasets for
different disease types. Notably, our approach does not alter the model
architecture, nor does it increase the number of parameters or computation
during the inference phase, making it highly efficient.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D测试时自适应方法依赖计算昂贵的空间域优化且可能需要额外训练数据，而点云的不规则和无序结构进一步增加了挑战。

Method: 通过图傅里叶变换（GFT）将点云转换到图谱域，仅优化最低10%频率成分以高效捕获全局结构特性，并结合自训练策略迭代优化。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，GSDTTA优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GSDTTA通过图谱域自适应和高效优化策略，显著提升了3D点云分类的性能。

Abstract: While test-time adaptation (TTA) methods effectively address domain shifts by
dynamically adapting pre-trained models to target domain data during online
inference, their application to 3D point clouds is hindered by their irregular
and unordered structure. Current 3D TTA methods often rely on computationally
expensive spatial-domain optimizations and may require additional training
data. In contrast, we propose Graph Spectral Domain Test-Time Adaptation
(GSDTTA), a novel approach for 3D point cloud classification that shifts
adaptation to the graph spectral domain, enabling more efficient adaptation by
capturing global structural properties with fewer parameters. Point clouds in
target domain are represented as outlier-aware graphs and transformed into
graph spectral domain by Graph Fourier Transform (GFT). For efficiency,
adaptation is performed by optimizing only the lowest 10% of frequency
components, which capture the majority of the point cloud's energy. An inverse
GFT (IGFT) is then applied to reconstruct the adapted point cloud with the
graph spectral-driven point shift. This process is enhanced by an
eigenmap-guided self-training strategy that iteratively refines both the
spectral adjustments and the model parameters. Experimental results and
ablation studies on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GSDTTA,
outperforming existing TTA methods for 3D point cloud classification.

Abstract: Feature-level fusion shows promise in collaborative perception (CP) through
balanced performance and communication bandwidth trade-off. However, its
effectiveness critically relies on input feature quality. The acquisition of
high-quality features faces domain gaps from hardware diversity and deployment
conditions, alongside temporal misalignment from transmission delays. These
challenges degrade feature quality with cumulative effects throughout the
collaborative network. In this paper, we present the Domain-And-Time Alignment
(DATA) network, designed to systematically align features while maximizing
their semantic representations for fusion. Specifically, we propose a
Consistency-preserving Domain Alignment Module (CDAM) that reduces domain gaps
through proximal-region hierarchical downsampling and observability-constrained
discriminator. We further propose a Progressive Temporal Alignment Module
(PTAM) to handle transmission delays via multi-scale motion modeling and
two-stage compensation. Building upon the aligned features, an Instance-focused
Feature Aggregation Module (IFAM) is developed to enhance semantic
representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DATA achieves
state-of-the-art performance on three typical datasets, maintaining robustness
with severe communication delays and pose errors. The code will be released at

Abstract: In recent years, foundation models for monocular depth estimation have
received increasing attention. Current methods mainly address typical daylight
conditions, but their effectiveness notably decreases in low-light
environments. There is a lack of robust foundational models for monocular depth
estimation specifically designed for low-light scenarios. This largely stems
from the absence of large-scale, high-quality paired depth datasets for
low-light conditions and the effective parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
strategy. To address these challenges, we propose DepthDark, a robust
foundation model for low-light monocular depth estimation. We first introduce a
flare-simulation module and a noise-simulation module to accurately simulate
the imaging process under nighttime conditions, producing high-quality paired
depth datasets for low-light conditions. Additionally, we present an effective
low-light PEFT strategy that utilizes illumination guidance and multiscale
feature fusion to enhance the model's capability in low-light environments. Our
method achieves state-of-the-art depth estimation performance on the
challenging nuScenes-Night and RobotCar-Night datasets, validating its
effectiveness using limited training data and computing resources.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-view scene reconstruction have been significant,
yet existing methods face limitations when processing streams of input images.
These methods either rely on time-consuming offline optimization or are
restricted to shorter sequences, hindering their applicability in real-time
scenarios. In this work, we propose LONG3R (LOng sequence streaming 3D
Reconstruction), a novel model designed for streaming multi-view 3D scene
reconstruction over longer sequences. Our model achieves real-time processing
by operating recurrently, maintaining and updating memory with each new
observation. We first employ a memory gating mechanism to filter relevant
memory, which, together with a new observation, is fed into a dual-source
refined decoder for coarse-to-fine interaction. To effectively capture
long-sequence memory, we propose a 3D spatio-temporal memory that dynamically
prunes redundant spatial information while adaptively adjusting resolution
along the scene. To enhance our model's performance on long sequences while
maintaining training efficiency, we employ a two-stage curriculum training
strategy, each stage targeting specific capabilities. Experiments demonstrate
that LONG3R outperforms state-of-the-art streaming methods, particularly for
longer sequences, while maintaining real-time inference speed. Project page:

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) plays a vital role in numerous
practical applications. In pursuit of determining the performance boundaries,
researchers employ large and expensive manual-labeling data for representation
learning. Nevertheless, this approach renders the state-of-the-art ISTD methods
highly fragile in real-world challenges. In this paper, we first study the
variation in detection performance across several mainstream methods under
various scarcity -- namely, the absence of high-quality infrared data -- that
challenge the prevailing theories about practical ISTD. To address this
concern, we introduce the Gaussian Agnostic Representation Learning.
Specifically, we propose the Gaussian Group Squeezer, leveraging Gaussian
sampling and compression for non-uniform quantization. By exploiting a diverse
array of training samples, we enhance the resilience of ISTD models against
various challenges. Then, we introduce two-stage diffusion models for
real-world reconstruction. By aligning quantized signals closely with
real-world distributions, we significantly elevate the quality and fidelity of
the synthetic samples. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art
detection methods in various scarcity scenarios demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed approach.

weighting was the main analytical method; lung function mediation was assessed
using the delta method. The results showed a significant positive causal effect
of dental caries on overall lung cancer and its subtypes. Specifically, a one
standard deviation increase in dental caries incidence was associated with a
188.0% higher risk of squamous cell lung carcinoma (OR = 2.880, 95% CI =
1.236--6.713, p = 0.014), partially mediated by declines in forced vital
capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), accounting
for 5.124% and 5.890% of the total effect. No causal effect was found for
periodontitis. These findings highlight a causal role of dental caries in lung
cancer risk and support integrating dental care and pulmonary function
monitoring into cancer prevention strategies.

TL;DR: LMM-Det是一种无需专用检测模块即可利用大型多模态模型进行对象检测的简单有效方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型（LMMs）在多模态任务中表现优异，但在对象检测能力上与专用检测器存在显著差距，需填补这一差距。

Method: 提出LMM-Det，通过数据分布调整和推理优化提升召回率，并重组指令对话以增强对象检测能力。

Result: 实验证明LMM-Det有效，大型多模态模型具备无需额外检测模块的检测能力。

Conclusion: LMM-Det展示了大型多模态模型在对象检测中的潜力，无需依赖专用检测模块。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have garnered wide-spread attention and
interest within the artificial intelligence research and industrial
communities, owing to their remarkable capability in multimodal understanding,
reasoning, and in-context learning, among others. While LMMs have demonstrated
promising results in tackling multimodal tasks like image captioning, visual
question answering, and visual grounding, the object detection capabilities of
LMMs exhibit a significant gap compared to specialist detectors. To bridge the
gap, we depart from the conventional methods of integrating heavy detectors
with LMMs and propose LMM-Det, a simple yet effective approach that leverages a
Large Multimodal Model for vanilla object Detection without relying on
specialized detection modules. Specifically, we conduct a comprehensive
exploratory analysis when a large multimodal model meets with object detection,
revealing that the recall rate degrades significantly compared with specialist
detection models. To mitigate this, we propose to increase the recall rate by
introducing data distribution adjustment and inference optimization tailored
for object detection. We re-organize the instruction conversations to enhance
the object detection capabilities of large multimodal models. We claim that a
large multimodal model possesses detection capability without any extra
detection modules. Extensive experiments support our claim and show the
effectiveness of the versatile LMM-Det. The datasets, models, and codes are
available at https://github.com/360CVGroup/LMM-Det.

TL;DR: FieldLVLM框架通过结合领域感知语言生成和数据压缩多模态模型调优，显著提升了大型视觉语言模型在科学领域数据理解上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在科学领域（尤其是复杂现场数据理解）的应用尚未充分探索，FieldLVLM旨在填补这一空白。

Method: FieldLVLM包含两个核心组件：领域感知语言生成策略（提取关键物理特征并转换为结构化文本）和数据压缩多模态模型调优（简化输入并保留关键信息）。

Result: 实验表明，FieldLVLM在科学领域数据任务中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FieldLVLM为大型视觉语言模型在科学研究中的应用提供了新思路，缩小了大模型与领域特定发现之间的差距。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
across a range of tasks that integrate visual and textual understanding, such
as image captioning and visual question answering. These models are trained on
large-scale image and video datasets paired with text, enabling them to bridge
visual perception and natural language processing. However, their application
to scientific domains, especially in interpreting complex field data commonly
used in the natural sciences, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce
FieldLVLM, a novel framework designed to improve large vision-language models'
understanding of field data. FieldLVLM consists of two main components: a
field-aware language generation strategy and a data-compressed multimodal model
tuning. The field-aware language generation strategy leverages a
special-purpose machine learning pipeline to extract key physical features from
field data, such as flow classification, Reynolds number, and vortex patterns.
This information is then converted into structured textual descriptions that
serve as a dataset. The data-compressed multimodal model tuning focuses on
LVLMs with these generated datasets, using a data compression strategy to
reduce the complexity of field inputs and retain only the most informative
values. This ensures compatibility with the models language decoder and guides
its learning more effectively. Experimental results on newly proposed benchmark
datasets demonstrate that FieldLVLM significantly outperforms existing methods
in tasks involving scientific field data. Our findings suggest that this
approach opens up new possibilities for applying large vision-language models
to scientific research, helping bridge the gap between large models and
domain-specific discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG标注对临床诊断至关重要，但公开标注数据稀缺限制了深度学习进展，半监督学习可利用大量未标注数据。

Method: 整合多个公共数据集，采用五种代表性SemiSeg算法，在卷积网络和Transformer架构上实现，并评估域内和跨域性能。

Result: Transformer在半监督ECG标注中表现优于卷积网络。

Conclusion: 该基准为半监督ECG标注方法的发展奠定了基础，并推动该领域进一步研究。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) delineation, the segmentation of meaningful waveform
features, is critical for clinical diagnosis. Despite recent advances using
deep learning, progress has been limited by the scarcity of publicly available
annotated datasets. Semi-supervised learning presents a promising solution by
leveraging abundant unlabeled ECG data. In this study, we present the first
systematic benchmark for semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SemiSeg) in ECG
delineation. We curated and unified multiple public datasets, including
previously underused sources, to support robust and diverse evaluation. We
adopted five representative SemiSeg algorithms from computer vision,
implemented them on two different architectures: the convolutional network and
the transformer, and evaluated them in two different settings: in-domain and
cross-domain. Additionally, we propose ECG-specific training configurations and
augmentation strategies and introduce a standardized evaluation framework. Our
results show that the transformer outperforms the convolutional network in
semi-supervised ECG delineation. We anticipate that our benchmark will serve as
a foundation for advancing semi-supervised ECG delineation methods and will
facilitate further research in this domain.

Motivation: 现有方法在结合局部和全局信息时需要调参，且缺乏理论保证，MNN旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 定义MNN族范数，通过变换矩阵并应用核范数，联合捕捉局部和全局信息。

Result: MNN在Robust PCA和矩阵补全任务中表现优异，实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: MNN提供了一种灵活且统一的方法，适用于结构化低秩恢复任务。

Abstract: The nuclear norm (NN) has been widely explored in matrix recovery problems,
such as Robust PCA and matrix completion, leveraging the inherent global
low-rank structure of the data. In this study, we introduce a new modified
nuclear norm (MNN) framework, where the MNN family norms are defined by
adopting suitable transformations and performing the NN on the transformed
matrix. The MNN framework offers two main advantages: (1) it jointly captures
both local information and global low-rankness without requiring trade-off
parameter tuning; (2) Under mild assumptions on the transformation, we provided
exact theoretical recovery guarantees for both Robust PCA and MC tasks-an
achievement not shared by existing methods that combine local and global
information. Thanks to its general and flexible design, MNN can accommodate
various proven transformations, enabling a unified and effective approach to
structured low-rank recovery. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method. Code and supplementary material are available at

Conclusion: GVCCS数据集和深度学习框架为改进尾迹监测和物理模型校准提供了高质量数据和方法，有助于更准确地评估气候影响。

Abstract: Aviation's climate impact includes not only CO2 emissions but also
significant non-CO2 effects, especially from contrails. These ice clouds can
alter Earth's radiative balance, potentially rivaling the warming effect of
aviation CO2. Physics-based models provide useful estimates of contrail
formation and climate impact, but their accuracy depends heavily on the quality
of atmospheric input data and on assumptions used to represent complex
processes like ice particle formation and humidity-driven persistence.
Observational data from remote sensors, such as satellites and ground cameras,
could be used to validate and calibrate these models. However, existing
datasets don't explore all aspect of contrail dynamics and formation: they
typically lack temporal tracking, and do not attribute contrails to their
source flights. To address these limitations, we present the Ground Visible
Camera Contrail Sequences (GVCCS), a new open data set of contrails recorded
with a ground-based all-sky camera in the visible range. Each contrail is
individually labeled and tracked over time, allowing a detailed analysis of its
lifecycle. The dataset contains 122 video sequences (24,228 frames) and
includes flight identifiers for contrails that form above the camera. As
reference, we also propose a unified deep learning framework for contrail
analysis using a panoptic segmentation model that performs semantic
segmentation (contrail pixel identification), instance segmentation (individual
contrail separation), and temporal tracking in a single architecture. By
providing high-quality, temporally resolved annotations and a benchmark for
model evaluation, our work supports improved contrail monitoring and will
facilitate better calibration of physical models. This sets the groundwork for
more accurate climate impact understanding and assessments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将体素的感受野限制在图像的固定位置，缺乏对几何和上下文信息的动态整合，且计算冗余。

Method: 引入几何和上下文感知聚合模块，动态调整多视角贡献；提出稀疏体积构建策略，选择高占用概率的体素进行特征优化。

Result: 在ScanNet、ScanNet200和ARKitScenes数据集上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SGCDet通过自适应体积构建和稀疏优化，实现了高效且高性能的3D物体检测，仅需3D边界框监督。

Abstract: This work presents SGCDet, a novel multi-view indoor 3D object detection
framework based on adaptive 3D volume construction. Unlike previous approaches
that restrict the receptive field of voxels to fixed locations on images, we
introduce a geometry and context aware aggregation module to integrate
geometric and contextual information within adaptive regions in each image and
dynamically adjust the contributions from different views, enhancing the
representation capability of voxel features. Furthermore, we propose a sparse
volume construction strategy that adaptively identifies and selects voxels with
high occupancy probabilities for feature refinement, minimizing redundant
computation in free space. Benefiting from the above designs, our framework
achieves effective and efficient volume construction in an adaptive way. Better
still, our network can be supervised using only 3D bounding boxes, eliminating
the dependence on ground-truth scene geometry. Experimental results demonstrate
that SGCDet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet, ScanNet200
and ARKitScenes datasets. The source code is available at

Motivation: 人类能够跨视角传递和整合知识，但多模态大语言模型在此能力上尚未被探索。

Method: 构建EgoExoBench基准，包含11个子任务，分为语义对齐、视角关联和时序推理三大挑战，评估了13个先进模型。

Result: 现有模型在单视角任务上表现优秀，但在跨视角语义对齐、视角关联和时序推理上表现较差。

Conclusion: EgoExoBench为研究跨视角智能提供了重要资源，有助于开发更接近人类智能的代理和助手。

Abstract: Transferring and integrating knowledge across first-person (egocentric) and
third-person (exocentric) viewpoints is intrinsic to human intelligence,
enabling humans to learn from others and convey insights from their own
experiences. Despite rapid progress in multimodal large language models
(MLLMs), their ability to perform such cross-view reasoning remains unexplored.
To address this, we introduce EgoExoBench, the first benchmark for
egocentric-exocentric video understanding and reasoning. Built from publicly
available datasets, EgoExoBench comprises over 7,300 question-answer pairs
spanning eleven sub-tasks organized into three core challenges: semantic
alignment, viewpoint association, and temporal reasoning. We evaluate 13
state-of-the-art MLLMs and find that while these models excel on single-view
tasks, they struggle to align semantics across perspectives, accurately
associate views, and infer temporal dynamics in the ego-exo context. We hope
EgoExoBench can serve as a valuable resource for research on embodied agents
and intelligent assistants seeking human-like cross-view intelligence.

Abstract: Bias in computer vision models remains a significant challenge, often
resulting in unfair, unreliable, and non-generalizable AI systems. Although
research into bias mitigation has intensified, progress continues to be
hindered by fragmented implementations and inconsistent evaluation practices.
Disparate datasets and metrics used across studies complicate reproducibility,
making it difficult to fairly assess and compare the effectiveness of various
approaches. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Visual Bias
Mitigator (VB-Mitigator), an open-source framework designed to streamline the
development, evaluation, and comparative analysis of visual bias mitigation
techniques. VB-Mitigator offers a unified research environment encompassing 12
established mitigation methods, 7 diverse benchmark datasets. A key strength of
VB-Mitigator is its extensibility, allowing for seamless integration of
additional methods, datasets, metrics, and models. VB-Mitigator aims to
accelerate research toward fairness-aware computer vision models by serving as
a foundational codebase for the research community to develop and assess their
approaches. To this end, we also recommend best evaluation practices and
provide a comprehensive performance comparison among state-of-the-art
methodologies.

Motivation: 解决现有可变形卷积难以捕捉长距离全局特征的问题，并适应复杂形状特征的需求。

Method: 利用注意力机制和前馈网络学习子像素位移场，自适应地变形特征图，而非直接变形卷积核，实现全局特征变形。

Result: 在眼底血管分割任务中，提出的GDCUnet模型在公开数据集上达到最优性能，且模块显著提升了复杂特征的学习能力。

Conclusion: 该模块适用于具有复杂全局自相似特征的机器视觉任务，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Deformable convolution can adaptively change the shape of convolution kernel
by learning offsets to deal with complex shape features. We propose a novel
plug and play deformable convolutional module that uses attention and
feedforward networks to learn offsets, so that the deformable patterns can
capture long-distance global features. Compared with previously existing
deformable convolutions, the proposed module learns the sub pixel displacement
field and adaptively warps the feature maps across all channels rather than
directly deforms the convolution kernel , which is equivalent to a relative
deformation of the kernel sampling grids, achieving global feature deformation
and the decoupling of kernel size and learning network. Considering that the
fundus blood vessels have globally self similar complex edges, we design a deep
learning model for fundus blood vessel segmentation, GDCUnet, based on the
proposed convolutional module. Empirical evaluations under the same
configuration and unified framework show that GDCUnet has achieved state of the
art performance on public datasets. Further ablation experiments demonstrated
that the proposed deformable convolutional module could more significantly
learn the complex features of fundus blood vessels, enhancing the model
representation and generalization capabilities.The proposed module is similar
to the interface of conventional convolution, we suggest applying it to more
machine vision tasks with complex global self similar features.

Abstract: Advances in generative modeling have significantly enhanced digital content
creation, extending from 2D images to complex 3D and 4D scenes. Despite
substantial progress, producing high-fidelity and temporally consistent dynamic
4D content remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose MVG4D, a novel
framework that generates dynamic 4D content from a single still image by
combining multi-view synthesis with 4D Gaussian Splatting (4D GS). At its core,
MVG4D employs an image matrix module that synthesizes temporally coherent and
spatially diverse multi-view images, providing rich supervisory signals for
downstream 3D and 4D reconstruction. These multi-view images are used to
optimize a 3D Gaussian point cloud, which is further extended into the temporal
domain via a lightweight deformation network. Our method effectively enhances
temporal consistency, geometric fidelity, and visual realism, addressing key
challenges in motion discontinuity and background degradation that affect prior
4D GS-based methods. Extensive experiments on the Objaverse dataset demonstrate
that MVG4D outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in CLIP-I, PSNR, FVD, and
time efficiency. Notably, it reduces flickering artifacts and sharpens
structural details across views and time, enabling more immersive AR/VR
experiences. MVG4D sets a new direction for efficient and controllable 4D
generation from minimal inputs.

Abstract: Current approaches to pose generation rely heavily on intermediate
representations, either through two-stage pipelines with quantization or
autoregressive models that accumulate errors during inference. This fundamental
limitation leads to degraded performance, particularly in long-term pose
generation where maintaining temporal coherence is crucial. We propose a novel
one-stage architecture that directly generates poses in continuous coordinate
space from minimal context - a single RGB image and text description - while
maintaining consistent distributions between training and inference. Our key
innovation is eliminating the need for intermediate representations or
token-based generation by operating directly on pose coordinates through a
relative movement prediction mechanism that preserves spatial relationships,
and a unified placeholder token approach that enables single-forward generation
with identical behavior during training and inference. Through extensive
experiments on Penn Action and First-Person Hand Action Benchmark (F-PHAB)
datasets, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing
quantization-based and autoregressive methods, especially in long-term
generation scenarios.

Abstract: Full-body Human inverse rendering based on physically-based rendering aims to
acquire high-quality materials, which helps achieve photo-realistic rendering
under arbitrary illuminations. This task requires estimating multiple material
maps and usually relies on the constraint of rendering result. The absence of
constraints on the material maps makes inverse rendering an ill-posed task.
Previous works alleviated this problem by building material dataset for
training, but their simplified material data and rendering equation lead to
rendering results with limited realism, especially that of skin. To further
alleviate this problem, we construct a higher-quality dataset (OpenHumanBRDF)
based on scanned real data and statistical material data. In addition to the
normal, diffuse albedo, roughness, specular albedo, we produce displacement and
subsurface scattering to enhance the realism of rendering results, especially
for the skin. With the increase in prediction tasks for more materials, using
an end-to-end model as in the previous work struggles to balance the importance
among various material maps, and leads to model underfitting. Therefore, we
design a model (HumanMaterial) with progressive training strategy to make full
use of the supervision information of the material maps and improve the
performance of material estimation. HumanMaterial first obtain the initial
material results via three prior models, and then refine the results by a
finetuning model. Prior models estimate different material maps, and each map
has different significance for rendering results. Thus, we design a Controlled
PBR Rendering (CPR) loss, which enhances the importance of the materials to be
optimized during the training of prior models. Extensive experiments on
OpenHumanBRDF dataset and real data demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: We introduce Iwin Transformer, a novel position-embedding-free hierarchical
vision transformer, which can be fine-tuned directly from low to high
resolution, through the collaboration of innovative interleaved window
attention and depthwise separable convolution. This approach uses attention to
connect distant tokens and applies convolution to link neighboring tokens,
enabling global information exchange within a single module, overcoming Swin
Transformer's limitation of requiring two consecutive blocks to approximate
global attention. Extensive experiments on visual benchmarks demonstrate that
Iwin Transformer exhibits strong competitiveness in tasks such as image
classification (87.4 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K), semantic segmentation and

Result: 在ISIC2018、DSB2018和MoNuSeg数据集上，DCFFSNet在所有指标上均优于现有主流方法，Dice和IoU提升显著。

Conclusion: DCFFSNet有效解决了分割碎片化问题，实现了平滑的边缘过渡，显著提升了临床实用性。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation leverages topological connectivity theory to
enhance edge precision and regional consistency. However, existing deep
networks integrating connectivity often forcibly inject it as an additional
feature module, resulting in coupled feature spaces with no standardized
mechanism to quantify different feature strengths. To address these issues, we
propose DCFFSNet (Dual-Connectivity Feature Fusion-Separation Network). It
introduces an innovative feature space decoupling strategy. This strategy
quantifies the relative strength between connectivity features and other
features. It then builds a deep connectivity feature fusion-separation
architecture. This architecture dynamically balances multi-scale feature
expression. Experiments were conducted on the ISIC2018, DSB2018, and MoNuSeg
datasets. On ISIC2018, DCFFSNet outperformed the next best model (CMUNet) by
1.3% (Dice) and 1.2% (IoU). On DSB2018, it surpassed TransUNet by 0.7% (Dice)
and 0.9% (IoU). On MoNuSeg, it exceeded CSCAUNet by 0.8% (Dice) and 0.9% (IoU).
The results demonstrate that DCFFSNet exceeds existing mainstream methods
across all metrics. It effectively resolves segmentation fragmentation and
achieves smooth edge transitions. This significantly enhances clinical
usability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声成像数据获取和标注困难，自监督学习能利用未标注数据提升性能。

Method: 采用V-JEPA框架，结合3D定位辅助任务改进ViT表示。

Result: 实验显示分割性能显著提升，数据利用率提高。

Conclusion: V-JEPA结合辅助任务是超声视频数据分析的有效方法。

Abstract: Acquiring and annotating large datasets in ultrasound imaging is challenging
due to low contrast, high noise, and susceptibility to artefacts. This process
requires significant time and clinical expertise. Self-supervised learning
(SSL) offers a promising solution by leveraging unlabelled data to learn useful
representations, enabling improved segmentation performance when annotated data
is limited. Recent state-of-the-art developments in SSL for video data include
V-JEPA, a framework solely based on feature prediction, avoiding pixel level
reconstruction or negative samples. We hypothesise that V-JEPA is well-suited
to ultrasound imaging, as it is less sensitive to noisy pixel-level detail
while effectively leveraging temporal information. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to adopt V-JEPA for ultrasound video data.
Similar to other patch-based masking SSL techniques such as VideoMAE, V-JEPA is
well-suited to ViT-based models. However, ViTs can underperform on small
medical datasets due to lack of inductive biases, limited spatial locality and
absence of hierarchical feature learning. To improve locality understanding, we
propose a novel 3D localisation auxiliary task to improve locality in ViT
representations during V-JEPA pre-training. Our results show V-JEPA with our
auxiliary task improves segmentation performance significantly across various
frozen encoder configurations, with gains up to 3.4\% using 100\% and up to
8.35\% using only 10\% of the training data.

Conclusion: NLML-HPE方法在有限数据下表现优异，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Head pose estimation (HPE) plays a critical role in various computer vision
applications such as human-computer interaction and facial recognition. In this
paper, we propose a novel deep learning approach for head pose estimation with
limited training data via non-linear manifold learning called NLML-HPE. This
method is based on the combination of tensor decomposition (i.e., Tucker
decomposition) and feed forward neural networks. Unlike traditional
classification-based approaches, our method formulates head pose estimation as
a regression problem, mapping input landmarks into a continuous representation
of pose angles. To this end, our method uses tensor decomposition to split each
Euler angle (yaw, pitch, roll) to separate subspaces and models each dimension
of the underlying manifold as a cosine curve. We address two key challenges: 1.
Almost all HPE datasets suffer from incorrect and inaccurate pose annotations.
Hence, we generated a precise and consistent 2D head pose dataset for our
training set by rotating 3D head models for a fixed set of poses and rendering
the corresponding 2D images. 2. We achieved real-time performance with limited
training data as our method accurately captures the nature of rotation of an
object from facial landmarks. Once the underlying manifold for rotation around
each axis is learned, the model is very fast in predicting unseen data. Our
training and testing code is available online along with our trained models:

Result: 微调后的MLLMs在问答任务中零样本性能提升73.2%，在意图预测和识别任务中性能提升最高达12.5%和11.0%。

Conclusion: PDB-Eval能有效缩小MLLMs与驾驶领域的差距，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Understanding a driver's behavior and intentions is important for potential
risk assessment and early accident prevention. Safety and driver assistance
systems can be tailored to individual drivers' behavior, significantly
enhancing their effectiveness. However, existing datasets are limited in
describing and explaining general vehicle movements based on external visual
evidence. This paper introduces a benchmark, PDB-Eval, for a detailed
understanding of Personalized Driver Behavior, and aligning Large Multimodal
Models (MLLMs) with driving comprehension and reasoning. Our benchmark consists
of two main components, PDB-X and PDB-QA. PDB-X can evaluate MLLMs'
understanding of temporal driving scenes. Our dataset is designed to find valid
visual evidence from the external view to explain the driver's behavior from
the internal view. To align MLLMs' reasoning abilities with driving tasks, we
propose PDB-QA as a visual explanation question-answering task for MLLM
instruction fine-tuning. As a generic learning task for generative models like
MLLMs, PDB-QA can bridge the domain gap without harming MLLMs'
generalizability. Our evaluation indicates that fine-tuning MLLMs on
fine-grained descriptions and explanations can effectively bridge the gap
between MLLMs and the driving domain, which improves zero-shot performance on
question-answering tasks by up to 73.2%. We further evaluate the MLLMs
fine-tuned on PDB-X in Brain4Cars' intention prediction and AIDE's recognition
tasks. We observe up to 12.5% performance improvements on the turn intention
prediction task in Brain4Cars, and consistent performance improvements up to
11.0% on all tasks in AIDE.

Result: 框架成功将模拟攻击转移到真实LiDAR系统，并提供了影响攻击成功因素的分析。

Conclusion: 该框架促进了公平比较和加速研究，同时深化了对真实LiDAR感知中对抗鲁棒性的理解。

Abstract: Adversarial robustness in LiDAR-based 3D object detection is a critical
research area due to its widespread application in real-world scenarios. While
many digital attacks manipulate point clouds or meshes, they often lack
physical realizability, limiting their practical impact. Physical adversarial
object attacks remain underexplored and suffer from poor reproducibility due to
inconsistent setups and hardware differences. To address this, we propose a
device-agnostic, standardized framework that abstracts key elements of physical
adversarial object attacks, supports diverse methods, and provides open-source
code with benchmarking protocols in simulation and real-world settings. Our
framework enables fair comparison, accelerates research, and is validated by
successfully transferring simulated attacks to a physical LiDAR system. Beyond
the framework, we offer insights into factors influencing attack success and
advance understanding of adversarial robustness in real-world LiDAR perception.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication plays a crucial role in autonomous
driving, enabling cooperation between vehicles and infrastructure. While
simulation has significantly contributed to various autonomous driving tasks,
its potential for data generation and augmentation in V2X scenarios remains
underexplored. In this paper, we introduce CRUISE, a comprehensive
reconstruction-and-synthesis framework designed for V2X driving environments.
CRUISE employs decomposed Gaussian Splatting to accurately reconstruct
real-world scenes while supporting flexible editing. By decomposing dynamic
traffic participants into editable Gaussian representations, CRUISE allows for
seamless modification and augmentation of driving scenes. Furthermore, the
framework renders images from both ego-vehicle and infrastructure views,
enabling large-scale V2X dataset augmentation for training and evaluation. Our
experimental results demonstrate that: 1) CRUISE reconstructs real-world V2X
driving scenes with high fidelity; 2) using CRUISE improves 3D detection across
ego-vehicle, infrastructure, and cooperative views, as well as cooperative 3D
tracking on the V2X-Seq benchmark; and 3) CRUISE effectively generates
challenging corner cases.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in medical images is an important yet challenging task due
to the diversity of possible anomalies and the practical impossibility of
collecting comprehensively annotated data sets. In this work, we tackle
unsupervised medical anomaly detection proposing a modernized autoencoder-based
framework, the Q-Former Autoencoder, that leverages state-of-the-art pretrained
vision foundation models, such as DINO, DINOv2 and Masked Autoencoder. Instead
of training encoders from scratch, we directly utilize frozen vision foundation
models as feature extractors, enabling rich, multi-stage, high-level
representations without domain-specific fine-tuning. We propose the usage of
the Q-Former architecture as the bottleneck, which enables the control of the
length of the reconstruction sequence, while efficiently aggregating multiscale
features. Additionally, we incorporate a perceptual loss computed using
features from a pretrained Masked Autoencoder, guiding the reconstruction
towards semantically meaningful structures. Our framework is evaluated on four
diverse medical anomaly detection benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art
results on BraTS2021, RESC, and RSNA. Our results highlight the potential of
vision foundation model encoders, pretrained on natural images, to generalize
effectively to medical image analysis tasks without further fine-tuning. We

Abstract: Accurate detection of Plasmodium falciparum in Giemsa-stained blood smears is
an essential component of reliable malaria diagnosis, especially in developing
countries. Deep learning-based object detection methods have demonstrated
strong potential for automated Malaria diagnosis, but their adoption is limited
by the scarcity of datasets with detailed instance-level annotations. In this
work, we present an enhanced version of the publicly available NIH malaria
dataset, with detailed bounding box annotations in COCO format to support
object detection training. We validated the revised annotations by training a
Faster R-CNN model to detect infected and non-infected red blood cells, as well
as white blood cells. Cross-validation on the original dataset yielded F1
scores of up to 0.88 for infected cell detection. These results underscore the
importance of annotation volume and consistency, and demonstrate that automated
annotation refinement combined with targeted manual correction can produce
training data of sufficient quality for robust detection performance. The
updated annotations set is publicly available via GitHub:

Motivation: 现有防御机制多为被动策略，依赖预定义假设，难以适应动态3D环境中的对抗攻击。

Method: Rein-EAD采用多步目标优化防御策略，结合预测精度与熵最小化，并通过不确定性导向的奖励机制高效更新策略。

Result: 实验表明Rein-EAD显著降低了攻击成功率，同时保持标准精度，并能泛化至未见过的攻击。

Conclusion: Rein-EAD是一种适用于复杂3D任务的高效主动防御框架。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks in 3D environments have emerged as a critical threat to
the reliability of visual perception systems, particularly in safety-sensitive
applications such as identity verification and autonomous driving. These
attacks employ adversarial patches and 3D objects to manipulate deep neural
network (DNN) predictions by exploiting vulnerabilities within complex scenes.
Existing defense mechanisms, such as adversarial training and purification,
primarily employ passive strategies to enhance robustness. However, these
approaches often rely on pre-defined assumptions about adversarial tactics,
limiting their adaptability in dynamic 3D settings. To address these
challenges, we introduce Reinforced Embodied Active Defense (Rein-EAD), a
proactive defense framework that leverages adaptive exploration and interaction
with the environment to improve perception robustness in 3D adversarial
contexts. By implementing a multi-step objective that balances immediate
prediction accuracy with predictive entropy minimization, Rein-EAD optimizes
defense strategies over a multi-step horizon. Additionally, Rein-EAD involves
an uncertainty-oriented reward-shaping mechanism that facilitates efficient
policy updates, thereby reducing computational overhead and supporting
real-world applicability without the need for differentiable environments.
Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Rein-EAD, demonstrating
a substantial reduction in attack success rates while preserving standard
accuracy across diverse tasks. Notably, Rein-EAD exhibits robust generalization
to unseen and adaptive attacks, making it suitable for real-world complex
tasks, including 3D object classification, face recognition and autonomous
driving.

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous driving are moving towards mapless approaches,
where High-Definition (HD) maps are generated online directly from sensor data,
reducing the need for expensive labeling and maintenance. However, the
reliability of these online-generated maps remains uncertain. While
incorporating map uncertainty into downstream trajectory prediction tasks has
shown potential for performance improvements, current strategies provide
limited insights into the specific scenarios where this uncertainty is
beneficial. In this work, we first analyze the driving scenarios in which
mapping uncertainty has the greatest positive impact on trajectory prediction
and identify a critical, previously overlooked factor: the agent's kinematic
state. Building on these insights, we propose a novel Proprioceptive Scenario
Gating that adaptively integrates map uncertainty into trajectory prediction
based on forecasts of the ego vehicle's future kinematics. This lightweight,
self-supervised approach enhances the synergy between online mapping and
trajectory prediction, providing interpretability around where uncertainty is
advantageous and outperforming previous integration methods. Additionally, we
introduce a Covariance-based Map Uncertainty approach that better aligns with
map geometry, further improving trajectory prediction. Extensive ablation
studies confirm the effectiveness of our approach, achieving up to 23.6%
improvement in mapless trajectory prediction performance over the
state-of-the-art method using the real-world nuScenes driving dataset. Our
code, data, and models are publicly available at

Abstract: In goal-directed visual tasks, human perception is guided by both top-down
and bottom-up cues. At the same time, foveal vision plays a crucial role in
directing attention efficiently. Modern research on bio-inspired computational
attention models has taken advantage of advancements in deep learning by
utilizing human scanpath data to achieve new state-of-the-art performance. In
this work, we assess the performance of SemBA-FAST, i.e. Semantic-based
Bayesian Attention for Foveal Active visual Search Tasks, a top-down framework
designed for predicting human visual attention in target-present visual search.
SemBA-FAST integrates deep object detection with a probabilistic semantic
fusion mechanism to generate attention maps dynamically, leveraging pre-trained
detectors and artificial foveation to update top-down knowledge and improve
fixation prediction sequentially. We evaluate SemBA-FAST on the COCO-Search18
benchmark dataset, comparing its performance against other scanpath prediction
models. Our methodology achieves fixation sequences that closely match human
ground-truth scanpaths. Notably, it surpasses baseline and other top-down
approaches and competes, in some cases, with scanpath-informed models. These
findings provide valuable insights into the capabilities of semantic-foveal
probabilistic frameworks for human-like attention modelling, with implications
for real-time cognitive computing and robotics.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful technique for
extracting human-interpretable features from neural networks activations.
Previous works compared different models based on SAE-derived features but
those comparisons have been restricted to models within the same modality. We
propose a novel indicator allowing quantitative comparison of models across SAE
features, and use it to conduct a comparative study of visual, textual and
multimodal encoders. We also propose to quantify the Comparative Sharedness of
individual features between different classes of models. With these two new
tools, we conduct several studies on 21 encoders of the three types, with two
significantly different sizes, and considering generalist and domain specific
datasets. The results allow to revisit previous studies at the light of
encoders trained in a multimodal context and to quantify to which extent all
these models share some representations or features. They also suggest that
visual features that are specific to VLMs among vision encoders are shared with
text encoders, highlighting the impact of text pretraining. The code is

Abstract: Object detection is one of the main applications of computer vision in remote
sensing imagery. Despite its increasing availability, the sheer volume of
remote sensing data poses a challenge when detecting rare objects across large
geographic areas. Paradoxically, this common challenge is crucial to many
applications, such as estimating environmental impact of certain human
activities at scale. In this paper, we propose to address the problem by
investigating the methane production and emissions of bio-digesters in France.
We first introduce a novel dataset containing bio-digesters, with small
training and validation sets, and a large test set with a high imbalance
towards observations without objects since such sites are rare. We develop a
part-based method that considers essential bio-digester sub-elements to boost
initial detections. To this end, we apply our method to new, unseen regions to
build an inventory of bio-digesters. We then compute geostatistical estimates
of the quantity of methane produced that can be attributed to these
infrastructures in a given area at a given time.

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction is one of the crucial tasks of autonomous
driving. It enables precise and safe interpretation and navigation in complex
environments. Reliable predictions rely on effective sensor fusion, as
different modalities can contain complementary information. Unlike conventional
methods that depend on dense grid representations, our approach,
GaussianFusionOcc, uses semantic 3D Gaussians alongside an innovative sensor
fusion mechanism. Seamless integration of data from camera, LiDAR, and radar
sensors enables more precise and scalable occupancy prediction, while 3D
Gaussian representation significantly improves memory efficiency and inference
speed. GaussianFusionOcc employs modality-agnostic deformable attention to
extract essential features from each sensor type, which are then used to refine
Gaussian properties, resulting in a more accurate representation of the

the versatility of our approach. By leveraging the robustness of multi-modal
fusion and the efficiency of Gaussian representation, GaussianFusionOcc

Result: 在多个开源模型上取得最优效果，并在IntentVC挑战中获得亚军。

Conclusion: IntentVCNet有效提升了模型在视频序列中建模空间细节的能力，实现精确的意图导向描述生成。

Abstract: Intent-oriented controlled video captioning aims to generate targeted
descriptions for specific targets in a video based on customized user intent.
Current Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have gained strong instruction
following and visual comprehension capabilities. Although the LVLMs
demonstrated proficiency in spatial and temporal understanding respectively, it
was not able to perform fine-grained spatial control in time sequences in
direct response to instructions. This substantial spatio-temporal gap
complicates efforts to achieve fine-grained intention-oriented control in
video. Towards this end, we propose a novel IntentVCNet that unifies the
temporal and spatial understanding knowledge inherent in LVLMs to bridge the
spatio-temporal gap from both prompting and model perspectives. Specifically,
we first propose a prompt combination strategy designed to enable LLM to model
the implicit relationship between prompts that characterize user intent and
video sequences. We then propose a parameter efficient box adapter that
augments the object semantic information in the global visual context so that
the visual token has a priori information about the user intent. The final
experiment proves that the combination of the two strategies can further
enhance the LVLM's ability to model spatial details in video sequences, and
facilitate the LVLMs to accurately generate controlled intent-oriented
captions. Our proposed method achieved state-of-the-art results in several open
source LVLMs and was the runner-up in the IntentVC challenge. Our code is

TL;DR: EDA扩展了基于任意噪声的扩散模型设计空间，解决了EDM中固定高斯噪声模式在图像恢复中的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EDM的固定高斯噪声模式限制了图像恢复的进展，强制注入高斯噪声会破坏退化图像并增加恢复复杂性。

Method: EDA通过扩展噪声模式的自由度，同时保留EDM的模块灵活性，理论证明增加噪声复杂性不会带来额外计算开销。

Result: EDA在MRI偏置场校正、CT金属伪影减少和自然图像阴影去除任务中表现优异，仅需5次采样步骤即超越多数任务专用方法。

Conclusion: EDA在噪声模式灵活性上取得突破，为图像恢复任务提供了高效且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: EDM elucidates the unified design space of diffusion models, yet its fixed
noise patterns restricted to pure Gaussian noise, limit advancements in image
restoration. Our study indicates that forcibly injecting Gaussian noise
corrupts the degraded images, overextends the image transformation distance,
and increases restoration complexity. To address this problem, our proposed EDA
Elucidates the Design space of Arbitrary-noise-based diffusion models.
Theoretically, EDA expands the freedom of noise pattern while preserving the
original module flexibility of EDM, with rigorous proof that increased noise
complexity incurs no additional computational overhead during restoration. EDA
is validated on three typical tasks: MRI bias field correction (global smooth
noise), CT metal artifact reduction (global sharp noise), and natural image
shadow removal (local boundary-aware noise). With only 5 sampling steps, EDA
outperforms most task-specific methods and achieves state-of-the-art
performance in bias field correction and shadow removal.

Abstract: Scaling visual generation models is essential for real-world content
creation, yet requires substantial training and computational expenses.
Alternatively, test-time scaling has garnered growing attention due to resource
efficiency and promising performance. In this work, we present TTS-VAR, the
first general test-time scaling framework for visual auto-regressive (VAR)
models, modeling the generation process as a path searching problem. To
dynamically balance computational efficiency with exploration capacity, we
first introduce an adaptive descending batch size schedule throughout the
causal generation process. Besides, inspired by VAR's hierarchical
coarse-to-fine multi-scale generation, our framework integrates two key
components: (i) At coarse scales, we observe that generated tokens are hard for
evaluation, possibly leading to erroneous acceptance of inferior samples or
rejection of superior samples. Noticing that the coarse scales contain
sufficient structural information, we propose clustering-based diversity
search. It preserves structural variety through semantic feature clustering,
enabling later selection on samples with higher potential. (ii) In fine scales,
resampling-based potential selection prioritizes promising candidates using
potential scores, which are defined as reward functions incorporating
multi-scale generation history. Experiments on the powerful VAR model Infinity
show a notable 8.7% GenEval score improvement (from 0.69 to 0.75). Key insights
reveal that early-stage structural features effectively influence final
quality, and resampling efficacy varies across generation scales. Code is

Motivation: 现有MVS模型在无姿态重建任务中因内存限制和输入图像数量增加而精度下降，需一种高效解决方案。

Method: 通过分区图像子集、全局映射点云，结合概率Procrustes对齐和软垃圾箱机制，联合优化几何与姿态。

Result: 在Waymo和KITTI数据集上实现了高精度重建和姿态估计，达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了无姿态3DGS重建问题，为大规模户外场景提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a core technique for 3D
representation. Its effectiveness largely depends on precise camera poses and
accurate point cloud initialization, which are often derived from pretrained
Multi-View Stereo (MVS) models. However, in unposed reconstruction task from
hundreds of outdoor images, existing MVS models may struggle with memory limits
and lose accuracy as the number of input images grows. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel unposed 3DGS reconstruction framework that
integrates pretrained MVS priors with the probabilistic Procrustes mapping
strategy. The method partitions input images into subsets, maps submaps into a
global space, and jointly optimizes geometry and poses with 3DGS. Technically,
we formulate the mapping of tens of millions of point clouds as a probabilistic
Procrustes problem and solve a closed-form alignment. By employing
probabilistic coupling along with a soft dustbin mechanism to reject uncertain
correspondences, our method globally aligns point clouds and poses within
minutes across hundreds of images. Moreover, we propose a joint optimization
framework for 3DGS and camera poses. It constructs Gaussians from
confidence-aware anchor points and integrates 3DGS differentiable rendering
with an analytical Jacobian to jointly refine scene and poses, enabling
accurate reconstruction and pose estimation. Experiments on Waymo and KITTI
datasets show that our method achieves accurate reconstruction from unposed
image sequences, setting a new state of the art for unposed 3DGS
reconstruction.

Conclusion: 该方法无需手动初始化，对超声视野变化鲁棒，具有可解释性。

Abstract: Intraoperative registration of real-time ultrasound (iUS) to preoperative
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains an unsolved problem due to severe
modality-specific differences in appearance, resolution, and field-of-view. To
address this, we propose a novel 3D cross-modal keypoint descriptor for MRI-iUS
matching and registration. Our approach employs a patient-specific
matching-by-synthesis approach, generating synthetic iUS volumes from
preoperative MRI. This enables supervised contrastive training to learn a
shared descriptor space.
  A probabilistic keypoint detection strategy is then employed to identify
anatomically salient and modality-consistent locations. During training, a
curriculum-based triplet loss with dynamic hard negative mining is used to
learn descriptors that are i) robust to iUS artifacts such as speckle noise and
limited coverage, and ii) rotation-invariant . At inference, the method detects
keypoints in MR and real iUS images and identifies sparse matches, which are
then used to perform rigid registration. Our approach is evaluated using 3D
MRI-iUS pairs from the ReMIND dataset. Experiments show that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art keypoint matching methods across 11 patients, with
an average precision of $69.8\%$. For image registration, our method achieves a
competitive mean Target Registration Error of 2.39 mm on the ReMIND2Reg
benchmark.
  Compared to existing iUS-MR registration approach, our framework is
interpretable, requires no manual initialization, and shows robustness to iUS
field-of-view variation. Code is available at

Conclusion: DRWKV不仅提升了图像增强效果，还在低光多目标跟踪任务中表现出良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement remains a challenging task, particularly in
preserving object edge continuity and fine structural details under extreme
illumination degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel model, DRWKV
(Detailed Receptance Weighted Key Value), which integrates our proposed Global
Edge Retinex (GER) theory, enabling effective decoupling of illumination and
edge structures for enhanced edge fidelity. Secondly, we introduce Evolving WKV
Attention, a spiral-scanning mechanism that captures spatial edge continuity
and models irregular structures more effectively. Thirdly, we design the
Bilateral Spectrum Aligner (Bi-SAB) and a tailored MS2-Loss to jointly align
luminance and chrominance features, improving visual naturalness and mitigating
artifacts. Extensive experiments on five LLIE benchmarks demonstrate that DRWKV
achieves leading performance in PSNR, SSIM, and NIQE while maintaining low
computational complexity. Furthermore, DRWKV enhances downstream performance in
low-light multi-object tracking tasks, validating its generalization
capabilities.

Conclusion: VideoMind为细粒度跨模态对齐和深度视频理解提供了强大基准，推动了情感和意图识别等领域的发展。

Abstract: This paper introduces VideoMind, a video-centric omni-modal dataset designed
for deep video content cognition and enhanced multi-modal feature
representation. The dataset comprises 103K video samples (3K reserved for
testing), each paired with audio and systematically detailed textual
descriptions. Specifically, every video and its audio is described across three
hierarchical layers (factual, abstract, and intent), progressing from surface
to depth. It contains over 22 million words, averaging ~225 words per sample.
VideoMind's key distinction from existing datasets is its provision of intent
expressions, which require contextual integration across the entire video and
are not directly observable. These deep-cognitive expressions are generated
using a Chain-of-Thought (COT) approach, prompting the mLLM through
step-by-step reasoning. Each description includes annotations for subject,
place, time, event, action, and intent, supporting downstream recognition
tasks. Crucially, we establish a gold-standard benchmark with 3,000 manually
validated samples for evaluating deep-cognitive video understanding. We design
hybrid-cognitive retrieval experiments, scored by multi-level retrieval
metrics, to appropriately assess deep video comprehension. Evaluation results
for models (e.g., InternVideo, VAST, UMT-L) are released. VideoMind serves as a
powerful benchmark for fine-grained cross-modal alignment and advances fields
requiring in-depth video understanding, such as emotion and intent recognition.

Conclusion: SynC为优化合成数据提供了一种有效策略，显著提升了零样本图像描述任务的性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot Image Captioning (ZIC) increasingly utilizes synthetic datasets
generated by text-to-image (T2I) models to mitigate the need for costly manual
annotation. However, these T2I models often produce images that exhibit
semantic misalignments with their corresponding input captions (e.g., missing
objects, incorrect attributes), resulting in noisy synthetic image-caption
pairs that can hinder model training. Existing dataset pruning techniques are
largely designed for removing noisy text in web-crawled data. However, these
methods are ill-suited for the distinct challenges of synthetic data, where
captions are typically well-formed, but images may be inaccurate
representations. To address this gap, we introduce SynC, a novel framework
specifically designed to refine synthetic image-caption datasets for ZIC.
Instead of conventional filtering or regeneration, SynC focuses on reassigning
captions to the most semantically aligned images already present within the
synthetic image pool. Our approach employs a one-to-many mapping strategy by
initially retrieving multiple relevant candidate images for each caption. We
then apply a cycle-consistency-inspired alignment scorer that selects the best
image by verifying its ability to retrieve the original caption via
image-to-text retrieval. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SynC
consistently and significantly improves performance across various ZIC models
on standard benchmarks (MS-COCO, Flickr30k, NoCaps), achieving state-of-the-art
results in several scenarios. SynC offers an effective strategy for curating
refined synthetic data to enhance ZIC.

Abstract: The poultry industry has been driven by broiler chicken production and has
grown into the world's largest animal protein sector. Automated detection of
chicken carcasses on processing lines is vital for quality control, food
safety, and operational efficiency in slaughterhouses and poultry processing
plants. However, developing robust deep learning models for tasks like instance
segmentation in these fast-paced industrial environments is often hampered by
the need for laborious acquisition and annotation of large-scale real-world
image datasets. We present the first pipeline generating photo-realistic,
automatically labeled synthetic images of chicken carcasses. We also introduce
a new benchmark dataset containing 300 annotated real-world images, curated
specifically for poultry segmentation research. Using these datasets, this
study investigates the efficacy of synthetic data and automatic data annotation
to enhance the instance segmentation of chicken carcasses, particularly when
real annotated data from the processing line is scarce. A small real dataset
with varying proportions of synthetic images was evaluated in prominent
instance segmentation models. Results show that synthetic data significantly
boosts segmentation performance for chicken carcasses across all models. This
research underscores the value of synthetic data augmentation as a viable and
effective strategy to mitigate data scarcity, reduce manual annotation efforts,
and advance the development of robust AI-driven automated detection systems for
chicken carcasses in the poultry processing industry.

Result: 在多种零样本适应场景中表现优异，尤其在复杂域中，同时显著减少适应时间。

Conclusion: SIDA通过合成图像和高效模块设计，实现了更优的零样本域适应性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot domain adaptation is a method for adapting a model to a target
domain without utilizing target domain image data. To enable adaptation without
target images, existing studies utilize CLIP's embedding space and text
description to simulate target-like style features. Despite the previous
achievements in zero-shot domain adaptation, we observe that these text-driven
methods struggle to capture complex real-world variations and significantly
increase adaptation time due to their alignment process. Instead of relying on
text descriptions, we explore solutions leveraging image data, which provides
diverse and more fine-grained style cues. In this work, we propose SIDA, a
novel and efficient zero-shot domain adaptation method leveraging synthetic
images. To generate synthetic images, we first create detailed, source-like
images and apply image translation to reflect the style of the target domain.
We then utilize the style features of these synthetic images as a proxy for the
target domain. Based on these features, we introduce Domain Mix and Patch Style
Transfer modules, which enable effective modeling of real-world variations. In
particular, Domain Mix blends multiple styles to expand the intra-domain
representations, and Patch Style Transfer assigns different styles to
individual patches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by showing
state-of-the-art performance in diverse zero-shot adaptation scenarios,
particularly in challenging domains. Moreover, our approach achieves high
efficiency by significantly reducing the overall adaptation time.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel deep learning-based approach for simultaneous age
and gender classification from facial images, designed to enhance the
effectiveness of targeted advertising campaigns. We propose a custom
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, optimized for both tasks,
which leverages the inherent correlation between age and gender information
present in facial features. Unlike existing methods that often treat these
tasks independently, our model learns shared representations, leading to
improved performance. The network is trained on a large, diverse dataset of
facial images, carefully pre-processed to ensure robustness against variations
in lighting, pose, and image quality. Our experimental results demonstrate a
significant improvement in gender classification accuracy, achieving 95%, and a
competitive mean absolute error of 5.77 years for age estimation. Critically,
we analyze the performance across different age groups, identifying specific
challenges in accurately estimating the age of younger individuals. This
analysis reveals the need for targeted data augmentation and model refinement
to address these biases. Furthermore, we explore the impact of different CNN
architectures and hyperparameter settings on the overall performance, providing
valuable insights for future research.

Result: 方法在性能上显著优于现有方法，并生成高保真度的去合成人脸图像。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了合成复制问题，适用于多种合成技术和人脸风格，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: A morph is created by combining two (or more) face images from two (or more)
identities to create a composite image that is highly similar to both
constituent identities, allowing the forged morph to be biometrically
associated with more than one individual. Morph Attack Detection (MAD) can be
used to detect a morph, but does not reveal the constituent images. Demorphing
- the process of deducing the constituent images - is thus vital to provide
additional evidence about a morph. Existing demorphing methods suffer from the
morph replication problem, where the outputs tend to look very similar to the
morph itself, or assume that train and test morphs are generated using the same
morph technique. The proposed method overcomes these issues. The method
decomposes a morph in latent space allowing it to demorph images created from
unseen morph techniques and face styles. We train our method on morphs created
from synthetic faces and test on morphs created from real faces using arbitrary
morph techniques. Our method outperforms existing methods by a considerable
margin and produces high fidelity demorphed face images.

Result: 在SDXL上优于DMD2，GPU时间更少；在SD3和CogVideoX上创高效合成新基准。

Conclusion: DMDX为高效图像和视频合成提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) is a promising score distillation
technique that compresses pre-trained teacher diffusion models into efficient
one-step or multi-step student generators. Nevertheless, its reliance on the
reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence minimization potentially induces mode
collapse (or mode-seeking) in certain applications. To circumvent this inherent
drawback, we propose Adversarial Distribution Matching (ADM), a novel framework
that leverages diffusion-based discriminators to align the latent predictions
between real and fake score estimators for score distillation in an adversarial
manner. In the context of extremely challenging one-step distillation, we
further improve the pre-trained generator by adversarial distillation with
hybrid discriminators in both latent and pixel spaces. Different from the mean
squared error used in DMD2 pre-training, our method incorporates the
distributional loss on ODE pairs collected from the teacher model, and thus
providing a better initialization for score distillation fine-tuning in the
next stage. By combining the adversarial distillation pre-training with ADM
fine-tuning into a unified pipeline termed DMDX, our proposed method achieves
superior one-step performance on SDXL compared to DMD2 while consuming less GPU
time. Additional experiments that apply multi-step ADM distillation on
SD3-Medium, SD3.5-Large, and CogVideoX set a new benchmark towards efficient
image and video synthesis.

Result: 在ScanNet、ScanNet200和nuScenes等数据集上达到SOTA性能，验证了方法的有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: HybridTM成功整合了Transformer和Mamba的优势，为3D语义分割提供了高效且强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in 3D
semantic segmentation through their powerful attention mechanisms, but the
quadratic complexity limits their modeling of long-range dependencies in
large-scale point clouds. While recent Mamba-based approaches offer efficient
processing with linear complexity, they struggle with feature representation
when extracting 3D features. However, effectively combining these complementary
strengths remains an open challenge in this field. In this paper, we propose
HybridTM, the first hybrid architecture that integrates Transformer and Mamba
for 3D semantic segmentation. In addition, we propose the Inner Layer Hybrid
Strategy, which combines attention and Mamba at a finer granularity, enabling
simultaneous capture of long-range dependencies and fine-grained local
features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization of our HybridTM on diverse indoor and outdoor datasets.
Furthermore, our HybridTM achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet,
ScanNet200, and nuScenes benchmarks. The code will be made available at

TL;DR: Scenethesis是一种新的3D软件合成方法，通过领域特定语言ScenethesisLang实现用户需求与生成软件的追踪，支持细粒度修改和复杂约束表达。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D软件生成方法无法修改特定元素且难以处理复杂空间和语义约束，Scenethesis旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 基于ScenethesisLang，将3D软件合成分解为多个阶段，支持独立验证、目标修改和系统约束满足。

Result: Scenethesis能准确捕捉80%以上用户需求，满足90%以上硬约束，并在视觉评估中比现有方法提升42.8%。

Conclusion: Scenethesis在3D软件生成中表现出色，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (UI) software has undergone a fundamental
transformation from traditional two-dimensional (2D) desktop/web/mobile
interfaces to spatial three-dimensional (3D) environments. While existing work
has made remarkable success in automated 2D software generation, such as
HTML/CSS and mobile app interface code synthesis, the generation of 3D software
still remains under-explored. Current methods for 3D software generation
usually generate the 3D environments as a whole and cannot modify or control
specific elements in the software. Furthermore, these methods struggle to
handle the complex spatial and semantic constraints inherent in the real world.
To address the challenges, we present Scenethesis, a novel
requirement-sensitive 3D software synthesis approach that maintains formal
traceability between user specifications and generated 3D software. Scenethesis
is built upon ScenethesisLang, a domain-specific language that serves as a
granular constraint-aware intermediate representation (IR) to bridge natural
language requirements and executable 3D software. It serves both as a
comprehensive scene description language enabling fine-grained modification of
3D software elements and as a formal constraint-expressive specification
language capable of expressing complex spatial constraints. By decomposing 3D
software synthesis into stages operating on ScenethesisLang, Scenethesis
enables independent verification, targeted modification, and systematic
constraint satisfaction. Our evaluation demonstrates that Scenethesis
accurately captures over 80% of user requirements and satisfies more than 90%
of hard constraints while handling over 100 constraints simultaneously.
Furthermore, Scenethesis achieves a 42.8% improvement in BLIP-2 visual
evaluation scores compared to the state-of-the-art method.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个基准测试，用于通过图像识别提示中调用的艺术家名称，并评估了多种方法在不同泛化场景下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究文本到图像模型中明确调用艺术家名称的争议性使用，并提供一个公共测试平台以促进负责任的内容审核。

Method: 构建包含110位艺术家的1.95M图像数据集，评估特征相似性基线、对比风格描述符、数据归因方法、监督分类器和少样本原型网络。

Result: 监督和少样本模型在已知艺术家和复杂提示下表现最佳，风格描述符在艺术家风格明显时泛化更好，多艺术家提示最具挑战性。

Conclusion: 基准测试揭示了改进空间，并提供了促进进一步研究的公开数据集和测试平台。

Abstract: A common and controversial use of text-to-image models is to generate
pictures by explicitly naming artists, such as "in the style of Greg
Rutkowski". We introduce a benchmark for prompted-artist recognition:
predicting which artist names were invoked in the prompt from the image alone.
The dataset contains 1.95M images covering 110 artists and spans four
generalization settings: held-out artists, increasing prompt complexity,
multiple-artist prompts, and different text-to-image models. We evaluate
feature similarity baselines, contrastive style descriptors, data attribution
methods, supervised classifiers, and few-shot prototypical networks.
Generalization patterns vary: supervised and few-shot models excel on seen
artists and complex prompts, whereas style descriptors transfer better when the
artist's style is pronounced; multi-artist prompts remain the most challenging.
Our benchmark reveals substantial headroom and provides a public testbed to
advance the responsible moderation of text-to-image models. We release the
dataset and benchmark to foster further research:

Motivation: 解决短电影生成中长范围叙事和视觉一致性的挑战。

Method: 采用自上而下的关键帧规划和自下而上的视频合成，结合多模态扩散变换器（MM-DiT）进行训练。

Result: 实验表明，Captain Cinema能高效生成视觉连贯且叙事一致的短电影。

Conclusion: 该框架为自动化生成高质量短电影提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present Captain Cinema, a generation framework for short movie generation.
Given a detailed textual description of a movie storyline, our approach firstly
generates a sequence of keyframes that outline the entire narrative, which
ensures long-range coherence in both the storyline and visual appearance (e.g.,
scenes and characters). We refer to this step as top-down keyframe planning.
These keyframes then serve as conditioning signals for a video synthesis model,
which supports long context learning, to produce the spatio-temporal dynamics
between them. This step is referred to as bottom-up video synthesis. To support
stable and efficient generation of multi-scene long narrative cinematic works,
we introduce an interleaved training strategy for Multimodal Diffusion
Transformers (MM-DiT), specifically adapted for long-context video data. Our
model is trained on a specially curated cinematic dataset consisting of
interleaved data pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that Captain Cinema
performs favorably in the automated creation of visually coherent and narrative
consistent short movies in high quality and efficiency. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估不同通信策略对LLM代理协作问题解决效率的影响，以优化AI教育中的应用。

Method: 在基于GPT-4o的双代理聊天环境中，测试四种通信模式（师生互动、同伴协作、互教互学、批判性辩论），并使用MATH数据集进行评估。

Result: 双代理协作优于单代理，同伴协作模式准确率最高；对话行为（如陈述、确认、提示）对协作至关重要。

Conclusion: 多代理框架提升计算任务效率，但有效的通信策略是解决AI教育中复杂问题的关键。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly utilized in AI-aided
education to support tutoring and learning. Effective communication strategies
among LLM agents improve collaborative problem-solving efficiency and
facilitate cost-effective adoption in education. However, little research has
systematically evaluated the impact of different communication strategies on
agents' problem-solving. Our study examines four communication modes,
\textit{teacher-student interaction}, \textit{peer-to-peer collaboration},
\textit{reciprocal peer teaching}, and \textit{critical debate}, in a
dual-agent, chat-based mathematical problem-solving environment using the
OpenAI GPT-4o model. Evaluated on the MATH dataset, our results show that
dual-agent setups outperform single agents, with \textit{peer-to-peer
collaboration} achieving the highest accuracy. Dialogue acts like statements,
acknowledgment, and hints play a key role in collaborative problem-solving.
While multi-agent frameworks enhance computational tasks, effective
communication strategies are essential for tackling complex problems in AI
education.

Conclusion: AI系统能有效减轻行政负担，提升医疗效率和质量。

Abstract: Clinician burnout has motivated the growing adoption of ambient medical
scribes in the clinic. In this work, we introduce a custom-built ambient scribe
application integrated into the EHR system at Included Health, a personalized
all-in-one healthcare company offering telehealth services. The application
uses Whisper for transcription and a modular in-context learning pipeline with
GPT-4o to automatically generate SOAP notes and patient instructions. Testing
on mock visit data shows that the notes generated by the application exceed the
quality of expert-written notes as determined by an LLM-as-a-judge. The
application has been widely adopted by the clinical practice, with over 540
clinicians at Included Health using the application at least once. 94% (n = 63)
of surveyed clinicians report reduced cognitive load during visits and 97% (n =
66) report less documentation burden when using the application. Additionally,
we show that post-processing notes with a fine-tuned BART model improves
conciseness. These findings highlight the potential for AI systems to ease
administrative burdens and support clinicians in delivering efficient,
high-quality care.

Motivation: 数字时代中，社交媒体对青少年身体形象的影响日益显著，研究旨在比较抖音和微信两大平台的不同影响。

Method: 采用平台化视角，对395名10至24岁男性青少年进行问卷调查，使用MBSRQ-AS量表评估身体形象。

Result: 抖音使用与外貌评价和身体满意度显著相关，微信则无显著影响。

Conclusion: 研究强调平台特性对社交媒体影响的重要性，为应对中国男性青少年身体形象问题提供见解。

Abstract: In the digital era, social media platforms play a pivotal role in shaping
adolescents' body image perceptions. This study examines how Douyin and WeChat,
two contrasting Chinese social media platforms, influence body image among
Chinese male adolescents. Employing a platformization perspective, we surveyed
395 male adolescents aged 10 to 24 using the Multidimensional Body-Self
Relations Questionnaire-Appearance Scales (MBSRQ-AS) to assess self-evaluation
and body satisfaction. Our findings reveal that Douyin usage is significantly
correlated with appearance evaluation and body area satisfaction, while WeChat
usage shows no significant correlation with any body image dimensions. These
results suggest that Douyin's algorithm-driven, video-centric environment
intensifies exposure to idealized body standards, impacting users at a
cognitive level. This study underscores the importance of considering
platform-specific characteristics in understanding social media's impact on
body image. It contributes to the broader discourse on how technological design
and content modalities mediate psychological outcomes, offering insights for
addressing body image concerns among male adolescents in China.

their usual T1D management. Findings: The BrisT1D dataset features both device
data from the T1D management systems and smartwatches used by participants, as
well as transcripts of monthly interviews and focus groups conducted during the
study. The device data is provided in a processed state, for usability and more
rapid analysis, and in a raw state, for in-depth exploration of novel insights
captured in the study. Conclusions: This dataset has a range of potential
applications. The quantitative elements can support blood glucose prediction,
hypoglycaemia prediction, and closed-loop algorithm development. The
qualitative elements enable the exploration of user experiences and opinions,

Conclusion: DHMS表现良好，但需进一步测试集成、用户接受度和扩展性。

Abstract: Traditional hostel management practices in academic institutions often suffer
from inefficiencies, delays, and fragmented communication. These systems fail
to meet the expectations of digitally native students and place a significant
operational burden on hostel staff. This paper introduces DHMS (Digital Hostel
Management System), a modular and integrated platform designed to digitize and
streamline essential hostel management functions. DHMS leverages modern web
technologies, artificial intelligence, and cloud infrastructure to automate
room allotment, grievance redressal, gate pass logistics, and communication via
a natural language chatbot. In simulation tests, DHMS achieved a 92% student
satisfaction rate in room allocation and maintained an average chatbot response
time below one second. Additional features include predictive analytics for
proactive maintenance planning and sentiment analysis for feedback processing.
While promising, the system requires further testing for integration across
multiple hostel blocks, user acceptance, scalability under load, and ERP
compatibility before campus-wide deployment. This work discusses the system
architecture, implementation approach, and factors critical to improving user
experience, administrative efficiency, and decision-making processes.

together with the user to co-construct an explanation that is simultaneously
useful to the user as well as grounded in data provenance. To illustrate this
vision, we present: 1) an initial prototype of such an agent; and 2) a scalable
evaluation framework based on user simulations and a large language model as a

Conclusion: 结论表明，通过区分共享任务和特定任务，可视化设计可以满足多用户群体的需求，提升整体实用性。

Abstract: Domain-specific visualizations sometimes focus on narrow, albeit important,
tasks for one group of users. This focus limits the utility of a visualization
to other groups working with the same data. While tasks elicited from other
groups can present a design pitfall if not disambiguated, they also present a
design opportunity -- development of visualizations that support multiple
groups. This development choice presents a trade off of broadening the scope
but limiting support for the more narrow tasks of any one group, which in some
cases can enhance the overall utility of the visualization. We investigate this
scenario through a design study where we develop \textit{Guidepost}, a
notebook-embedded visualization of supercomputer queue data that helps
scientists assess supercomputer queue wait times, machine learning researchers
understand prediction accuracy, and system maintainers analyze usage trends. We
adapt the use of personas for visualization design from existing literature in
the HCI and software engineering domains and apply them in categorizing tasks
based on their uniqueness across the stakeholder personas. Under this model,
tasks shared between all groups should be supported by interactive
visualizations and tasks unique to each group can be deferred to scripting with
notebook-embedded visualization design. We evaluate our visualization with nine
expert analysts organized into two groups: a "research analyst" group that uses
supercomputer queue data in their research (representing the Machine Learning
researchers and Jobs Data Analyst personas) and a "supercomputer user" group
that uses this data conditionally (representing the HPC User persona). We find
that our visualization serves our three stakeholder groups by enabling users to
successfully execute shared tasks with point-and-click interaction while
facilitating case-specific programmatic analysis workflows.

Result: 算法通过R2作为置信度指标验证，在自然碰撞避免数据中表现良好，具有高效性和通用性。

Conclusion: 该算法高效、通用，适用于多种道路用户和场景，但存在一定局限性。

Abstract: Response timing measures play a crucial role in the assessment of automated
driving systems (ADS) in collision avoidance scenarios, including but not
limited to establishing human benchmarks and comparing ADS to human driver
response performance. For example, measuring the response time (of a human
driver or ADS) to a conflict requires the determination of a stimulus onset and
a response onset. In existing studies, response onset relies on manual
annotation or vehicle control signals such as accelerator and brake pedal
movements. These methods are not applicable when analyzing large scale data
where vehicle control signals are not available. This holds in particular for
the rapidly expanding sets of ADS log data where the behavior of surrounding
road users is observed via onboard sensors. To advance evaluation techniques
for ADS and enable measuring response timing when vehicle control signals are
not available, we developed a simple and efficient algorithm, based on a
piecewise linear acceleration model, to automatically estimate brake onset that
can be applied to any type of driving data that includes vehicle longitudinal
time series data. We also proposed a manual annotation method to identify brake
onset and used it as ground truth for validation. R2 was used as a confidence
metric to measure the accuracy of the algorithm, and its classification
performance was analyzed using naturalistic collision avoidance data of both
ADS and humans, where our method was validated against human manual annotation.
Although our algorithm is subject to certain limitations, it is efficient,
generalizable, applicable to any road user and scenario types, and is highly
configurable.

Conclusion: 研究为AI辅助教育研究提供了可扩展模型，并揭示了生成式AI在教育中的新兴角色。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into educational tools has
the potential to substantially impact how teachers plan instruction, support
diverse learners, and engage in professional reflection. Yet little is known
about how educators actually use these tools in practice and how their
interactions with AI can be meaningfully studied at scale. This paper presents
a human-AI collaborative methodology for large-scale qualitative analysis of
over 140,000 educator-AI messages drawn from a generative AI platform used by
K-12 teachers. Through a four-phase coding pipeline, we combined inductive
theme discovery, codebook development, structured annotation, and model
benchmarking to examine patterns of educator engagement and evaluate the
performance of LLMs in qualitative coding tasks. We developed a hierarchical
codebook aligned with established teacher evaluation frameworks, capturing
educators' instructional goals, contextual needs, and pedagogical strategies.
Our findings demonstrate that LLMs, particularly Claude 3.5 Haiku, can reliably
support theme identification, extend human recognition in complex scenarios,
and outperform open-weight models in both accuracy and structural reliability.
The analysis also reveals substantive patterns in how educators inquire AI to
enhance instructional practices (79.7 percent of total conversations), create
or adapt content (76.1 percent), support assessment and feedback loop (46.9
percent), attend to student needs for tailored instruction (43.3 percent), and
assist other professional responsibilities (34.2 percent), highlighting
emerging AI-related competencies that have direct implications for teacher
preparation and professional development. This study offers a scalable,
transparent model for AI-augmented qualitative research and provides
foundational insights into the evolving role of generative AI in educational
practice.

Conclusion: 研究为优化2D标量场可视化设计提供了实证依据，强调了显示方式和分布特性的重要性。

Abstract: In this work we study the identification of spatial correlation in
distributions of 2D scalar fields, presented across different forms of visual
displays. We study simple visual displays that directly show color-mapped
scalar fields, namely those drawn from a distribution, and whether humans can
identify strongly correlated spatial regions in these displays. In this
setting, the recognition of correlation requires making judgments on a set of
fields, rather than just one field. Thus, in our experimental design we compare
two basic visualization designs: animation-based displays against juxtaposed
views of scalar fields, along different choices of color scales. Moreover, we
investigate the impacts of the distribution itself, controlling for the level
of spatial correlation and discriminability in spatial scales. Our study's
results illustrate the impacts of these distribution characteristics, while
also highlighting how different visual displays impact the types of judgments
made in assessing spatial correlation. Supplemental material is available at

*Nisha Devasia,Georgia Kenderova,Michele Newman,Julie Kientz,Jin Ha Lee*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究探讨了数字游戏中eudaimonic体验（与个人意义和成长相关）的感知结果及其形成要素，填补了现有理论中对效果研究的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注游戏的享乐体验（如愉悦感），而对eudaimonic体验的效果及其对个人积极结果的影响研究较少。

Method: 通过调查（n=166）和混合方法分析，分类了游戏体验的效果并识别了其形成的关键子成分。

Result: 发现有意义游戏体验能带来反思、学习、社交、健康和职业等积极效果。

Conclusion: 研究扩展了eudaimonic游戏体验的理论模型，为研究者和从业者提供了促进玩家积极结果的实践启示。

Abstract: While much of the research in digital games has emphasized hedonic
experiences, such as flow, enjoyment, and positive affect, recent years have
seen increased interest in eudaimonic gaming experiences, typically
mixed-affect and associated with personal meaningfulness and growth. The
formation of such experiences in games is theorized to have four constituent
elements: motivation, game use, experience, and effects. However, while the
first three elements have been relatively well explored in the literature, the
effects - and how they may influence positive individual outcomes - have been
underexplored thus far. To this end, in this work, we investigate the perceived
outcomes of eudaimonic gaming and how different components of the experience
influence these effects. We conducted a survey (n = 166) in which respondents
recounted meaningful gaming experiences and how they affected their present
lives. We used a mixed-methods approach to classify effects and identify
significant subcomponents of their formation. We contribute an empirical
understanding of how meaningful gaming experiences can lead to positive
reflective, learning, social, health, and career effects, extending current
theoretical models of eudaimonic gaming experiences and offering implications
for how researchers and practitioners might use these findings to promote
positive outcomes for players.

### [104] [Effects of variation in system responsiveness on user performance in virtual environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18085)
*Benjamin Watson,Neff Walker,William Ribarsky,Victoria Spaulding*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文研究了虚拟环境中的系统响应性（SR），分析了其统计特性（MSR和SDSR）对抓取和放置任务性能的影响，发现SDSR仅在高阈值（82ms以上）时影响性能，且放置任务对SR更敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨虚拟环境中系统响应性的统计特性及其对用户任务性能的影响，为优化人机交互界面提供依据。

Method: 通过三项实验（分别有11、12和10名参与者）研究MSR和SDSR对抓取和放置任务的影响。

Result: SDSR仅在超过82ms时影响性能；放置任务对SR更敏感，需要更频繁的视觉反馈。

Conclusion: 虚拟环境设计无需严格控制SDSR，可根据视觉反馈需求调整SR控制，适用于多种交互式图形应用。

Abstract: System responsiveness (SR) is defined as the elapsed time until a system
responds to user control. SR fluctuates over time, so it must be described
statistically with mean (MSR) and standard deviation (SDSR). In this paper, we
examine SR in virtual environments (VEs), outlining its components and methods
of experimental measurement and manipulation. Three studies of MSR and SDSR
effects on performance of grasp and placement tasks are then presented. The
studies used within-subjects designs with 11, 12, and 10 participants,
respectively. Results showed that SDSR affected performance only if it was
above 82 ms. Placement required more frequent visual feedback and was more
sensitive to SR. We infer that VE designers need not tightly control SDSR and
may wish to vary SR control based on required visual feedback frequency. These
results may be used to improve the human-computer interface in a wide range of
interactive graphical applications, including scientific visualization,
training, mental health, and entertainment.

*Shizhen Zhang,Shengxin Li,Quan Li*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Understood是一个基于混合现实（MR）的系统，旨在帮助成人ADHD患者在现实沟通中减少认知负荷、提高流畅度和保持话题聚焦。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 成人ADHD患者因执行功能障碍和情绪失调面临沟通挑战，现有干预措施主要针对儿童，缺乏适合成人的日常沟通支持工具。

Method: 通过半结构化访谈和设计研讨会确定需求，开发了具备实时对话摘要、上下文感知词建议和话题转移检测功能的MR系统。

Result: 用户研究和专家访谈表明，Understood在支持沟通方面高效且易用。

Conclusion: Understood为成人ADHD患者提供了一种有效的沟通辅助工具，可作为治疗干预的补充。

Abstract: Adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) often experience
communication challenges, primarily due to executive dysfunction and emotional
dysregulation, even after years of social integration. While existing
interventions predominantly target children through structured or intrusive
methods, adults lack tools that translate clinical strategies into daily
communication support. To address this gap, we present Understood, a Mixed
Reality (MR) system implemented on Microsoft HoloLens 2, designed to assist
adults with ADHD in real-world communication. Through formative semi-structured
interviews and a design workshop, we identified critical communication barriers
and derived design goals for the system. Understood combines three key
features: (1) real-time conversation summarization to reduce cognitive load,
(2) context-aware subsequent word suggestions during moments of disfluency, and
(3) topic shifting detection and reminding to mitigate off-topic transitions. A
within-subjects user study and expert interviews demonstrate that Understood
effectively supports communication with high usability, offering a complement
to therapist-mediated interventions.

### [106] [ProactiveVA: Proactive Visual Analytics with LLM-Based UI Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18165)
*Yuheng Zhao,Xueli Shu,Liwen Fan,Lin Gao,Yu Zhang,Siming Chen*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ProactiveVA的框架，通过LLM驱动的UI代理主动监控用户交互并提供上下文感知的辅助。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM辅助的VA系统仅在用户明确请求时提供帮助，无法在用户最需要时主动提供建议。

Method: 通过用户交互日志分析帮助寻求行为，设计了三阶段的UI代理流程（感知、推理、行动），并在两种VA系统中实现。

Result: 框架通过算法评估、案例和专家研究及用户研究验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 讨论了主动VA的设计权衡和未来探索方向。

Abstract: Visual analytics (VA) is typically applied to complex data, thus requiring
complex tools. While visual analytics empowers analysts in data analysis,
analysts may get lost in the complexity occasionally. This highlights the need
for intelligent assistance mechanisms. However, even the latest LLM-assisted VA
systems only provide help when explicitly requested by the user, making them
insufficiently intelligent to offer suggestions when analysts need them the
most. We propose a ProactiveVA framework in which LLM-powered UI agent monitors
user interactions and delivers context-aware assistance proactively. To design
effective proactive assistance, we first conducted a formative study analyzing
help-seeking behaviors in user interaction logs, identifying when users need
proactive help, what assistance they require, and how the agent should
intervene. Based on this analysis, we distilled key design requirements in
terms of intent recognition, solution generation, interpretability and
controllability. Guided by these requirements, we develop a three-stage UI
agent pipeline including perception, reasoning, and acting. The agent
autonomously perceives users' needs from VA interaction logs, providing
tailored suggestions and intuitive guidance through interactive exploration of
the system. We implemented the framework in two representative types of VA
systems, demonstrating its generalizability, and evaluated the effectiveness
through an algorithm evaluation, case and expert study and a user study. We
also discuss current design trade-offs of proactive VA and areas for further
exploration.

*Lorenzo Porcaro,Chiara Monaldi*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究通过访谈意大利音乐听众，分析其对推荐系统的理解，揭示文化背景下的认知不足和性别差异问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨推荐系统在音乐领域可能带来的代表性伤害，尤其是从心理社会和文化角度分析听众的认知。

Method: 采用情感文本分析法（Emotional Textual Analysis）分析意大利音乐听众的访谈叙事。

Result: 听众对推荐系统缺乏批判性理解，性别差异问题未被充分认识。

Conclusion: 需跨学科研究解决代表性伤害，提升算法意识和数字素养以构建可信推荐系统。

Abstract: Recommender systems shape music listening worldwide due to their widespread
adoption in online platforms. Growing concerns about representational harms
that these systems may cause are nowadays part of the scientific and public
debate, wherein music listener perspectives are oftentimes reported and
discussed from a cognitive-behaviorism perspective, but rarely contextualised
under a psychosocial and cultural lens. We proceed in this direction, by
interviewing a group of Italian music listeners and analysing their narratives
through Emotional Textual Analysis. Thanks to this, we identify shared cultural
repertoires that reveal people's complex relationship with listening practices:
even when familiar with online platforms, listeners may still lack a critical
understanding of recommender systems. Moreover, representational issues,
particularly gender disparities, seem not yet fully grasped in the context of
online music listening. This study underscores the need for interdisciplinary
research to address representational harms, and the role of algorithmic
awareness and digital literacy in developing trustworthy recommender systems.

*Dongyang Guo,Yasmeen Abdrabou,Enkeleda Thaqi,Enkelejda Kasneci*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多模态人机协作框架，用于从眼动追踪数据中提取认知模式，结合专家评分和LLM分析，提升了准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 眼动追踪数据虽能揭示用户认知状态，但其结构化、非语言特性使其难以分析，而LLM在处理此类数据时存在局限性。

Method: 框架包括多阶段管道、专家-模型协同评分模块和混合异常检测模块，结合LLM和专家判断。

Result: 实验显示，该方法在一致性、可解释性和性能上均有提升，难度预测任务准确率最高达50%。

Conclusion: 该方法为认知建模提供了可扩展、可解释的解决方案，适用于自适应学习、人机交互和教育分析。

Abstract: Eye-tracking data reveals valuable insights into users' cognitive states but
is difficult to analyze due to its structured, non-linguistic nature. While
large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning over text, they struggle with
temporal and numerical data. This paper presents a multimodal human-AI
collaborative framework designed to enhance cognitive pattern extraction from
eye-tracking signals. The framework includes: (1) a multi-stage pipeline using
horizontal and vertical segmentation alongside LLM reasoning to uncover latent
gaze patterns; (2) an Expert-Model Co-Scoring Module that integrates expert
judgment with LLM output to generate trust scores for behavioral
interpretations; and (3) a hybrid anomaly detection module combining LSTM-based
temporal modeling with LLM-driven semantic analysis. Our results across several
LLMs and prompt strategies show improvements in consistency, interpretability,
and performance, with up to 50% accuracy in difficulty prediction tasks. This
approach offers a scalable, interpretable solution for cognitive modeling and
has broad potential in adaptive learning, human-computer interaction, and
educational analytics.

*Rhys Jacka,Paola R. Peña,Sophie Leonard,Éva Székely,Benjamin R. Cowan*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究探讨了语言不流利性对人类-机器对话（HMD）中视角采择和听众设计的影响，发现不流利的语音代理被认为更胜任，但未显著影响对话灵活性或人类相似性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言不流利性在HMD中的作用，填补了人类-人类交流（HHC）与HMD之间研究的空白。

Method: 61名参与者在在线Namer-Matcher任务中与流利或不流利的语音代理互动，完成前后问卷评估。

Result: 不流利代理被认为更胜任，但未显著影响其他评估维度；与不流利代理互动可能增加自我中心沟通。

Conclusion: 语言不流利性可能影响HMD中的伙伴模型和语言生成，但效果尚不明确，需进一步研究。

Abstract: Speech disfluencies play a role in perspective-taking and audience design in
human-human communication (HHC), but little is known about their impact in
human-machine dialogue (HMD). In an online Namer-Matcher task, sixty-one
participants interacted with a speech agent using either fluent or disfluent
speech. Participants completed a partner-modelling questionnaire (PMQ) both
before and after the task. Post-interaction evaluations indicated that
participants perceived the disfluent agent as more competent, despite no
significant differences in pre-task ratings. However, no notable differences
were observed in assessments of conversational flexibility or human-likeness.
Our findings also reveal evidence of egocentric and allocentric language
production when participants interact with speech agents. Interaction with
disfluent speech agents appears to increase egocentric communication in
comparison to fluent agents. Although the wide credibility intervals mean this
effect is not clear-cut. We discuss potential interpretations of this finding,
focusing on how disfluencies may impact partner models and language production
in HMD.

*Mahiro Ozaki,Li Chen,Shotaro Naganuma,Valdemar Švábenský,Fumiya Okubo,Atsushi Shimada*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: PALM是一个学习分析仪表盘，通过整合课程级信息解决学习分析的可扩展性问题，提升学习者的学习规划和反思能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统学习分析主要关注单一课程或学习者，缺乏对课程间关系和学习长期轨迹的框架。PALM旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 开发PALM，整合多层教育数据到课程地图中，并进行系统评估，测试其对学习行为意识和现有系统性能的影响。

Result: PALM显著提升学习者的学习规划和反思能力，视觉吸引力和可用性优于现有系统。

Conclusion: PALM通过提供新见解增强自主学习，代表了学习分析向全面可扩展方法的重要进展。

Abstract: This study proposes and evaluates the PAnoramic Learning Map (PALM), a
learning analytics (LA) dashboard designed to address the scalability
challenges of LA by integrating curriculum-level information. Traditional LA
research has predominantly focused on individual courses or learners and often
lacks a framework that considers the relationships between courses and the
long-term trajectory of learning. To bridge this gap, PALM was developed to
integrate multilayered educational data into a curriculum map, enabling
learners to intuitively understand their learning records and academic
progression. We conducted a system evaluation to assess PALM's effectiveness in
two key areas: (1) its impact on students' awareness of their learning
behaviors, and (2) its comparative performance against existing systems. The
results indicate that PALM enhances learners' awareness of study planning and
reflection, particularly by improving perceived behavioral control through the
visual presentation of individual learning histories and statistical trends,
which clarify the links between learning actions and outcomes. Although PALM
requires ongoing refinement as a system, it received significantly higher
evaluations than existing systems in terms of visual appeal and usability. By
serving as an information resource with previously inaccessible insights, PALM
enhances self-regulated learning and engagement, representing a significant
step beyond conventional LA toward a comprehensive and scalable approach.

TL;DR: 本文探讨多感官整合（MSI）的关键因素及其在研究设计中的应用，强调多模态交互的复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多感官整合的动机在于理解多种感官如何协同工作以形成统一感知，尤其是在多模态（三种及以上）交互未被充分探索的情况下。

Method: 通过分析跨模态对应性、一致性、认知负荷和刺激时间等关键因素，设计有效的MSI研究协议。

Result: 文章总结了多感官整合研究中需考虑的核心因素，为未来研究提供了设计框架。

Conclusion: 多感官整合研究需综合考虑多种因素，以更全面地理解多模态交互的复杂性。

Abstract: We experience the world through multiple senses that work together to create
a cohesive perception, whether in daily life or immersive technologies.
Understanding this multisensory integration (MSI) requires examining the
interactions between sensory modalities, each with unique temporal dynamics and
characteristics. While most research focuses on unimodal or bimodal cues, the
integration of three or more modalities remains underexplored. MSI studies must
account for factors like cross-modal correspondence, congruence, cognitive
load, and stimulus timing, which become increasingly complex as modalities
multiply. This article examines these key factors and how they can be applied
to 8 design effective MSI study protocols.

TL;DR: 提出了一种描述决策问题的方案，帮助可视化研究更精确地支持决策任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有任务模型常忽略决策的背景条件，需改进以更好地支持决策任务。

Method: 通过数据、用户和任务上下文的关键属性描述决策问题。

Result: 方案能更精确地指定决策支持声明，并指导视觉编码和交互设计。

Conclusion: 该方案为决策中心的可视化研究提供了未来方向。

Abstract: Decision-making is a central yet under-defined goal in visualization
research. While existing task models address decision processes, they often
neglect the conditions framing a decision. To better support decision-making
tasks, we propose a characterization scheme that describes decision problems
through key properties of the data, users, and task context. This scheme helps
visualization researchers specify decision-support claims more precisely and
informs the design of appropriate visual encodings and interactions. We
demonstrate the utility of our approach by applying it to characterize decision
tasks targeted by existing design studies, highlighting opportunities for
future research in decision-centric visualization.

Motivation: 解决多维数据可视化中高维无损可视化能力不足及遮挡问题。

Method: 使用同心坐标（Concentric Coordinates），作为平行坐标和圆形坐标的紧凑推广形式，支持机器学习算法可视化。

Result: 实现了高维数据的无损可视化，避免了遮挡问题，并支持人机交互。

Conclusion: 同心坐标框架为多维数据可视化提供了高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: The visualization of multi-dimensional data with interpretable methods
remains limited by capabilities for both high-dimensional lossless
visualizations that do not suffer from occlusion and that are computationally
capable by parameterized visualization. This paper proposes a low to high
dimensional data supporting framework using lossless Concentric Coordinates
that are a more compact generalization of Parallel Coordinates along with
former Circular Coordinates. These are forms of the General Line Coordinate
visualizations that can directly support machine learning algorithm
visualization and facilitate human interaction.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: ForcePinch是一种新型的力响应空间交互方法，通过捏合力动态调整跟踪速度，平衡效率与精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有技术将跟踪速度调整与手部动作直接耦合，降低了交互灵活性，受物理世界中自然摩擦控制启发，提出ForcePinch。

Method: 开发了集成压力传感器的硬件原型，将捏合力映射为跟踪速度调整，并与Go-Go和PRISM技术对比。

Result: 用户研究表明，ForcePinch在不同交互场景中表现独特，尤其在快速与精确运动间平滑过渡。

Conclusion: 力响应交互具有情境意义和多功能性，为未来空间交互设计提供启示。

Abstract: Spatial interaction in 3D environments requires balancing efficiency and
precision, which requires dynamic tracking speed adjustments. However, existing
techniques often couple tracking speed adjustments directly with hand
movements, reducing interaction flexibility. Inspired by the natural friction
control inherent in the physical world, we introduce ForcePinch, a novel
force-responsive spatial interaction method that enables users to intuitively
modulate pointer tracking speed and smoothly transition between rapid and
precise movements by varying their pinching force. To implement this concept,
we developed a hardware prototype integrating a pressure sensor with a
customizable mapping function that translates pinching force into tracking
speed adjustments. We conducted a user study with 20 participants performing
well-established 1D, 2D, and 3D object manipulation tasks, comparing ForcePinch
against the distance-responsive technique Go-Go and speed-responsive technique
PRISM. Results highlight distinctive characteristics of the force-responsive
approach across different interaction contexts. Drawing on these findings, we
highlight the contextual meaning and versatility of force-responsive
interactions through four illustrative examples, aiming to inform and inspire
future spatial interaction design.

TL;DR: PosterMate是一个海报设计助手，通过生成多样化的用户角色代理提供反馈，并模拟讨论以达成共识，帮助设计师捕捉不同视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海报设计需要多样化的用户反馈，但实际收集和协调这些反馈具有挑战性。生成式AI可以模拟人类互动，但其在设计反馈中的应用尚不明确。

Method: PosterMate通过营销文档构建用户角色代理，收集反馈并模拟讨论，最终整合共识到设计中。

Result: 用户研究（N=12）表明PosterMate能捕捉被忽视的视角；在线评估（N=100）显示角色代理的反馈与其身份一致，讨论能有效综合不同视角。

Conclusion: PosterMate展示了生成式AI在设计反馈中的潜力，可作为有效的原型工具。

Abstract: Poster designing can benefit from synchronous feedback from target audiences.
However, gathering audiences with diverse perspectives and reconciling them on
design edits can be challenging. Recent generative AI models present
opportunities to simulate human-like interactions, but it is unclear how they
may be used for feedback processes in design. We introduce PosterMate, a poster
design assistant that facilitates collaboration by creating audience-driven
persona agents constructed from marketing documents. PosterMate gathers
feedback from each persona agent regarding poster components, and stimulates
discussion with the help of a moderator to reach a conclusion. These
agreed-upon edits can then be directly integrated into the poster design.
Through our user study (N=12), we identified the potential of PosterMate to
capture overlooked viewpoints, while serving as an effective prototyping tool.
Additionally, our controlled online evaluation (N=100) revealed that the
feedback from an individual persona agent is appropriate given its persona
identity, and the discussion effectively synthesizes the different persona
agents' perspectives.

Motivation: 科研可重复性是良好科学实践的重要组成部分，尤其是在地学等领域，研究人员使用交互式和沉浸式可视化工具处理地理空间数据。

Method: 研究评估了一种DLB工具，记录用户与虚拟野外工作工具的交互，并标注可视化状态。通过用户研究比较了沉浸式和非沉浸式环境下工具的易用性和实用性。

Result: 参与者认为DLB既实用又易用，沉浸式环境下的易用性感知略高，但使用模式上无显著组间差异。

Conclusion: DLB工具在支持科研可重复性方面具有潜力，尤其是在沉浸式环境中可能更易用。

Abstract: Ensuring reproducibility of research is an integral part of good scientific
practice. One way to support this is through provenance: information about
research workflows from data gathering to researchers' sensemaking processes
leading to published results. This is highly important in disciplines such as
geosciences, where researchers use software for interactive and immersive
visualizations of geospatial data, doing virtual measurements in simulated
fieldwork on 3D models. We evaluated a provenance management tool, which allows
recording of interactions with a virtual fieldwork tool and annotating
different states of the visualization. The user study investigated how
researchers used this Digital Lab Book (DLB) and whether perceived ease of use
and perceived usefulness differed between groups in immersive or non-immersive
settings. Participants perceived the DLB as both useful and easy to use. While
there were indications of differences in perceived ease of use (higher for
immersive setting), usage patterns showed no significant group differences.

*Fatih Erdem Kizilkaya,David Kempe*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 论文研究了单胜者排名选举中多数原则与少数原则的权衡，提出了$k$-Approval Veto投票规则，分析了其在社会福祉与少数群体保护之间的折衷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨民主系统中多数原则（最大化社会福利）与少数原则（保护少数群体）之间的冲突与平衡。

Method: 使用度量失真框架衡量社会福利，引入$\ell$-mutual minority准则衡量少数保护，分析$k$-Approval Veto投票规则的性能。

Result: $k$-Approval Veto提供少数保护至少$k$，但社会福祉随$k$增加而降低。功利目标失真线性增长，$\alpha$-百分位目标在$\alpha \ge k/(k+1)$时最优，平等目标失真恒为3。

Conclusion: $k$-Approval Veto投票规则能灵活平衡多数与少数原则，但需在保护与社会福祉间权衡。

Abstract: In the context of single-winner ranked-choice elections between $m$
candidates, we explore the tradeoff between two competing goals in every
democratic system: the majority principle (maximizing the social welfare) and
the minority principle (safeguarding minority groups from overly bad
outcomes).To measure the social welfare, we use the well-established framework
of metric distortion subject to various objectives: utilitarian (i.e., total
cost), $\alpha$-percentile (e.g., median cost for $\alpha = 1/2$), and
egalitarian (i.e., max cost). To measure the protection of minorities, we
introduce the $\ell$-mutual minority criterion, which requires that if a
sufficiently large (parametrized by $\ell$) coalition $T$ of voters ranks all
candidates in $S$ lower than all other candidates, then none of the candidates
in $S$ should win. The highest $\ell$ for which the criterion is satisfied
provides a well-defined measure of mutual minority protection (ranging from 1
to $m$).
  Our main contribution is the analysis of a recently proposed class of voting
rules called $k$-Approval Veto, offering a comprehensive range of trade-offs
between the two principles. This class spans between Plurality Veto (for $k=1$)
- a simple voting rule achieving optimal metric distortion - and Vote By Veto
(for $k=m$) which picks a candidate from the proportional veto core. We show
that $k$-Approval Veto has minority protection at least $k$, and thus, it
accommodates any desired level of minority protection. However, this comes at
the price of lower social welfare. For the utilitarian objective, the metric
distortion increases linearly in $k$. For the $\alpha$-percentile objective,
the metric distortion is the optimal value of 5 for $\alpha \ge k/(k+1)$ and
unbounded for $\alpha < k/(k+1)$. For the egalitarian objective, the metric
distortion is the optimal value of 3 for all values of $k$.

Motivation: 探索在个性化双值效用下，如何高效且公平地分配不可分割物品，填补现有研究在帕累托最优和EFX分配方面的空白。

Method: 通过刻画帕累托最优分配的条件，提出多项式时间算法（整数价值比）并证明一般情况下的coNP完全性。同时证明EFX分配的存在性及多项式时间可计算性。

Conclusion: 扩展了双值效用下的结果，提出了EFX与帕累托最优共存的开问题，为未来研究指明方向。

Abstract: We study the fair division problem of allocating $m$ indivisible goods to $n$
agents with additive personalized bi-valued utilities. Specifically, each agent
$i$ assigns one of two positive values $a_i > b_i > 0$ to each good, indicating
that agent $i$'s valuation of any good is either $a_i$ or $b_i$. For
convenience, we denote the value ratio of agent $i$ as $r_i = a_i / b_i$.
  We give a characterization to all the Pareto-optimal allocations. Our
characterization implies a polynomial-time algorithm to decide if a given
allocation is Pareto-optimal in the case each $r_i$ is an integer. For the
general case (where $r_i$ may be fractional), we show that this decision
problem is coNP-complete. Our result complements the existing results: this
decision problem is coNP-complete for tri-valued utilities (where each agent's
value for each good belongs to $\{a,b,c\}$ for some prescribed $a>b>c\geq0$),
and this decision problem belongs to P for bi-valued utilities (where $r_i$ in
our model is the same for each agent).
  We further show that an EFX allocation always exists and can be computed in
polynomial time under the personalized bi-valued utilities setting, which
extends the previous result on bi-valued utilities. We propose the open problem
of whether an EFX and Pareto-optimal allocation always exists (and can be
computed in polynomial time).

### [120] [Enhancing Quantization-Aware Training on Edge Devices via Relative Entropy Coreset Selection and Cascaded Layer Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17768)
*Yujia Tong,Jingling Yuan,Chuang Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QuaRC是一种在边缘设备上使用核心集进行量化感知训练（QAT）的框架，通过相对熵评分和级联层校正策略，显著减少量化误差并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘设备上低比特量化模型的需求增加，但传统QAT依赖完整数据集且计算成本高，同时隐私限制要求敏感数据只能在边缘处理。

Method: QuaRC包含两个阶段：1) 使用相对熵评分选择核心集；2) 采用级联层校正策略对齐量化模型与全精度模型的中间层输出。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K数据集上，QuaRC使用1%数据子集量化ResNet-18至2比特时，Top-1准确率比现有技术提高5.72%。

Conclusion: QuaRC有效解决了小规模数据集下的量化误差问题，显著提升了边缘设备上量化模型的性能。

Abstract: With the development of mobile and edge computing, the demand for low-bit
quantized models on edge devices is increasing to achieve efficient deployment.
To enhance the performance, it is often necessary to retrain the quantized
models using edge data. However, due to privacy concerns, certain sensitive
data can only be processed on edge devices. Therefore, employing
Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) on edge devices has become an effective
solution. Nevertheless, traditional QAT relies on the complete dataset for
training, which incurs a huge computational cost. Coreset selection techniques
can mitigate this issue by training on the most representative subsets.
However, existing methods struggle to eliminate quantization errors in the
model when using small-scale datasets (e.g., only 10% of the data), leading to
significant performance degradation. To address these issues, we propose QuaRC,
a QAT framework with coresets on edge devices, which consists of two main
phases: In the coreset selection phase, QuaRC introduces the ``Relative Entropy
Score" to identify the subsets that most effectively capture the model's
quantization errors. During the training phase, QuaRC employs the Cascaded
Layer Correction strategy to align the intermediate layer outputs of the
quantized model with those of the full-precision model, thereby effectively
reducing the quantization errors in the intermediate layers. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. For instance, when
quantizing ResNet-18 to 2-bit using a 1% data subset, QuaRC achieves a 5.72%
improvement in Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset compared to
state-of-the-art techniques.

TL;DR: 提出了一种低复杂度、通用的AI模型，利用因果不变学习改进语义通信中信道解码器的数据重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决用户数据多样化导致的语义通信中数据重建和知识一致性问题。

Method: 采用生成对抗网络（GAN）结合因果不变学习，提取数据的因果和非因果表示，并设计稀疏更新协议。

Result: 因果不变知识确保跨设备一致性，分类任务表现优异，数据重建性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在语义通信中表现出高效性和鲁棒性，适用于多样化数据场景。

Abstract: In this study, we design a low-complexity and generalized AI model that can
capture common knowledge to improve data reconstruction of the channel decoder
for semantic communication. Specifically, we propose a generative adversarial
network that leverages causality-invariant learning to extract causal and
non-causal representations from the data. Causal representations are invariant
and encompass crucial information to identify the data's label. They can
encapsulate semantic knowledge and facilitate effective data reconstruction at
the receiver. Moreover, the causal mechanism ensures that learned
representations remain consistent across different domains, making the system
reliable even with users collecting data from diverse domains. As
user-collected data evolves over time causing knowledge divergence among users,
we design sparse update protocols to improve the invariant properties of the
knowledge while minimizing communication overheads. Three key observations were
drawn from our empirical evaluations. Firstly, causality-invariant knowledge
ensures consistency across different devices despite the diverse training data.
Secondly, invariant knowledge has promising performance in classification
tasks, which is pivotal for goal-oriented semantic communications. Thirdly, our
knowledge-based data reconstruction highlights the robustness of our decoder,
which surpasses other state-of-the-art data reconstruction and semantic
compression methods in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR).

TL;DR: GraphEXT是一个基于合作博弈论和社会外部性的GNN可解释性框架，通过分解图节点为联盟并量化节点重要性，显著提升GNN的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN的'黑盒'特性导致其可解释性不足，现有方法难以捕捉节点间复杂的交互模式。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，GraphEXT在多种GNN架构中的保真度优于基线方法。

Conclusion: GraphEXT通过强调节点交互和结构变化的影响，显著提升了GNN的可解释性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved outstanding performance across a
wide range of graph-related tasks. However, their "black-box" nature poses
significant challenges to their explainability, and existing methods often fail
to effectively capture the intricate interaction patterns among nodes within
the network. In this work, we propose a novel explainability framework,
GraphEXT, which leverages cooperative game theory and the concept of social
externalities. GraphEXT partitions graph nodes into coalitions, decomposing the
original graph into independent subgraphs. By integrating graph structure as an
externality and incorporating the Shapley value under externalities, GraphEXT
quantifies node importance through their marginal contributions to GNN
predictions as the nodes transition between coalitions. Unlike traditional
Shapley value-based methods that primarily focus on node attributes, our
GraphEXT places greater emphasis on the interactions among nodes and the impact
of structural changes on GNN predictions. Experimental studies on both
synthetic and real-world datasets show that GraphEXT outperforms existing
baseline methods in terms of fidelity across diverse GNN architectures ,
significantly enhancing the explainability of GNN models.

Conclusion: 调整特征网络的自相似性程度可有效提升深度神经网络的分类性能，尤其在MLP和注意力架构中表现显著。

Abstract: Current research has found that some deep neural networks exhibit strong
hierarchical self-similarity in feature representation or parameter
distribution. However, aside from preliminary studies on how the power-law
distribution of weights across different training stages affects model
performance,there has been no quantitative analysis on how the self-similarity
of hidden space geometry influences model weight optimization, nor is there a
clear understanding of the dynamic behavior of internal neurons. Therefore,
this paper proposes a complex network modeling method based on the output
features of hidden-layer neurons to investigate the self-similarity of feature
networks constructed at different hidden layers, and analyzes how adjusting the
degree of self-similarity in feature networks can enhance the classification
performance of deep neural networks. Validated on three types of networks MLP
architectures, convolutional networks, and attention architectures this study
reveals that the degree of self-similarity exhibited by feature networks varies
across different model architectures. Furthermore, embedding constraints on the
self-similarity of feature networks during the training process can improve the
performance of self-similar deep neural networks (MLP architectures and
attention architectures) by up to 6 percentage points.

Motivation: 目标是通过强化学习方法减少计算成本，并解释优化结果在流场中的作用。

Result: 在简单流体动力学问题上，方法能加速全局优化并提供特征重要性评分。

Conclusion: 该方法在降维优化中有效，能减少计算量并解释优化结果。

Abstract: We introduce a reinforcement learning (RL) based adaptive optimization
algorithm for aerodynamic shape optimization focused on dimensionality
reduction. The form in which RL is applied here is that of a surrogate-based,
actor-critic policy evaluation MCMC approach allowing for temporal 'freezing'
of some of the parameters to be optimized. The goals are to minimize
computational effort, and to use the observed optimization results for
interpretation of the discovered extrema in terms of their role in achieving
the desired flow-field.
  By a sequence of local optimized parameter changes around intermediate CFD
simulations acting as ground truth, it is possible to speed up the global
optimization if (a) the local neighbourhoods of the parameters in which the
changed parameters must reside are sufficiently large to compete with the
grid-sized steps and its large number of simulations, and (b) the estimates of
the rewards and costs on these neighbourhoods necessary for a good step-wise
parameter adaption are sufficiently accurate. We give an example of a simple
fluid-dynamical problem on which the method allows interpretation in the sense
of a feature importance scoring.

TL;DR: 论文指出，当前多智能体强化学习（MARL）的成功依赖于简单约定而非有效信号恢复，并提出需要设计更真实的测试环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨当前MARL算法在Dec-POMDP框架下的局限性，揭示其成功依赖于简单约定而非环境观察和记忆。

Method: 通过案例研究，分析智能体在合作任务中的行为模式，尤其是与非适应性智能体合作时的失败情况。

Result: 研究发现智能体可以学习脆弱的约定，任务设计不足导致模型未能真正测试Dec-POMDP的核心假设。

Conclusion: 呼吁设计新的合作环境，强调基于观察的行为和基于记忆的推理，以测试智能体的真实能力。

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is typically formalised
as a Decentralised Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP),
where agents must reason about the environment and other agents' behaviour. In
practice, current model-free MARL algorithms use simple recurrent function
approximators to address the challenge of reasoning about others using partial
information. In this position paper, we argue that the empirical success of
these methods is not due to effective Markov signal recovery, but rather to
learning simple conventions that bypass environment observations and memory.
Through a targeted case study, we show that co-adapting agents can learn
brittle conventions, which then fail when partnered with non-adaptive agents.
Crucially, the same models can learn grounded policies when the task design
necessitates it, revealing that the issue is not a fundamental limitation of
the learning models but a failure of the benchmark design. Our analysis also
suggests that modern MARL environments may not adequately test the core
assumptions of Dec-POMDPs. We therefore advocate for new cooperative
environments built upon two core principles: (1) behaviours grounded in
observations and (2) memory-based reasoning about other agents, ensuring
success requires genuine skill rather than fragile, co-adapted agreements.

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on massive datasets, including large language
models (LLMs), vision-language models (VLMs), and large multimodal models, have
demonstrated remarkable success in diverse downstream tasks. However, recent
studies have shown fundamental limitations of these models: (1) limited
representational capacity, (2) lower adaptability, and (3) diminishing
scalability. These shortcomings raise a critical question: is Euclidean
geometry truly the optimal inductive bias for all foundation models, or could
incorporating alternative geometric spaces enable models to better align with
the intrinsic structure of real-world data and improve reasoning processes?
Hyperbolic spaces, a class of non-Euclidean manifolds characterized by
exponential volume growth with respect to distance, offer a mathematically
grounded solution. These spaces enable low-distortion embeddings of
hierarchical structures (e.g., trees, taxonomies) and power-law distributions
with substantially fewer dimensions compared to Euclidean counterparts. Recent
advances have leveraged these properties to enhance foundation models,
including improving LLMs' complex reasoning ability, VLMs' zero-shot
generalization, and cross-modal semantic alignment, while maintaining parameter
efficiency. This paper provides a comprehensive review of hyperbolic neural
networks and their recent development for foundation models. We further outline
key challenges and research directions to advance the field.

Conclusion: Moving Out基准测试和BASS方法为物理约束环境下的人机协作提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The ability to adapt to physical actions and constraints in an environment is
crucial for embodied agents (e.g., robots) to effectively collaborate with
humans. Such physically grounded human-AI collaboration must account for the
increased complexity of the continuous state-action space and constrained
dynamics caused by physical constraints. In this paper, we introduce
\textit{Moving Out}, a new human-AI collaboration benchmark that resembles a
wide range of collaboration modes affected by physical attributes and
constraints, such as moving heavy items together and maintaining consistent
actions to move a big item around a corner. Using Moving Out, we designed two
tasks and collected human-human interaction data to evaluate models' abilities
to adapt to diverse human behaviors and unseen physical attributes. To address
the challenges in physical environments, we propose a novel method, BASS
(Behavior Augmentation, Simulation, and Selection), to enhance the diversity of
agents and their understanding of the outcome of actions. Our experiments show
that BASS outperforms state-of-the-art models in AI-AI and human-AI
collaboration. The project page is available at

Motivation: LLM在排序和评估任务中存在位置偏差和重复不一致性，传统方法通过多次重复调用和多数投票解决，但计算成本高。

Method: 提出动态早停方法，根据实例自适应确定重复次数，并引入基于置信度的改进版本。

Conclusion: 动态早停方法有效降低了计算成本，同时保持了任务准确性，为LLM的实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: When using LLMs to rank items based on given criteria, or evaluate answers,
the order of candidate items can influence the model's final decision. This
sensitivity to item positioning in a LLM's prompt is known as position bias.
Prior research shows that this bias exists even in large models, though its
severity varies across models and tasks. In addition to position bias, LLMs
also exhibit varying degrees of low repetition consistency, where repeating the
LLM call with the same candidate ordering can lead to different rankings. To
address both inconsistencies, a common approach is to prompt the model multiple
times with different candidate orderings and aggregate the results via majority
voting. However, this repetition strategy, significantly increases
computational costs. Extending prior findings, we observe that both the
direction -- favoring either the earlier or later candidate in the prompt --
and magnitude of position bias across instances vary substantially, even within
a single dataset. This observation highlights the need for a per-instance
mitigation strategy. To this end, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping method
that adaptively determines the number of repetitions required for each
instance. Evaluating our approach across three LLMs of varying sizes and on two
tasks, namely re-ranking and alignment, we demonstrate that transitioning to a
dynamic repetition strategy reduces the number of LLM calls by an average of
81%, while preserving the accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a confidence-based
adaptation to our early-stopping method, reducing LLM calls by an average of
87% compared to static repetition, with only a slight accuracy trade-off
relative to our original early-stopping method.

Conclusion: CICME通过结合全局和个体领域数据分析，显著提升了因果机制推断的准确性。

Abstract: To gain deeper insights into a complex sensor system through the lens of
causality, we present common and individual causal mechanism estimation
(CICME), a novel three-step approach to inferring causal mechanisms from
heterogeneous data collected across multiple domains. By leveraging the
principle of Causal Transfer Learning (CTL), CICME is able to reliably detect
domain-invariant causal mechanisms when provided with sufficient samples. The
identified common causal mechanisms are further used to guide the estimation of
the remaining causal mechanisms in each domain individually. The performance of
CICME is evaluated on linear Gaussian models under scenarios inspired from a
manufacturing process. Building upon existing continuous optimization-based
causal discovery methods, we show that CICME leverages the benefits of applying
causal discovery on the pooled data and repeatedly on data from individual
domains, and it even outperforms both baseline methods under certain scenarios.

Conclusion: LSDM在移动流量预测中表现出卓越的泛化能力和适应性，结合LLM后性能显著提升。

Abstract: Service-level mobile traffic prediction for individual users is essential for
network efficiency and quality of service enhancement. However, current
prediction methods are limited in their adaptability across different urban
environments and produce inaccurate results due to the high uncertainty in
personal traffic patterns, the lack of detailed environmental context, and the
complex dependencies among different network services. These challenges demand
advanced modeling techniques that can capture dynamic traffic distributions and
rich environmental features. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models
in distribution modeling and Large Language Models (LLMs) in contextual
understanding, we propose an LLM-Enhanced Spatio-temporal Diffusion Model
(LSDM). LSDM integrates the generative power of diffusion models with the
adaptive learning capabilities of transformers, augmented by the ability to
capture multimodal environmental information for modeling service-level
patterns and dynamics. Extensive evaluations on real-world service-level
datasets demonstrate that the model excels in traffic usage predictions,
showing outstanding generalization and adaptability. After incorporating
contextual information via LLM, the performance improves by at least 2.83% in
terms of the coefficient of determination. Compared to models of a similar
type, such as CSDI, the root mean squared error can be reduced by at least
8.29%. The code and dataset will be available at:

Abstract: We propose a novel framework that harnesses the power of generative
artificial intelligence and copula-based modeling to address two critical
challenges in multivariate time-series analysis: delivering accurate
predictions and enabling robust anomaly detection. Our method, Copula-based
Conformal Anomaly Identification for Multivariate Time-Series (CoCAI),
leverages a diffusion-based model to capture complex dependencies within the
data, enabling high quality forecasting. The model's outputs are further
calibrated using a conformal prediction technique, yielding predictive regions
which are statistically valid, i.e., cover the true target values with a
desired confidence level. Starting from these calibrated forecasts, robust
outlier detection is performed by combining dimensionality reduction techniques
with copula-based modeling, providing a statistically grounded anomaly score.
CoCAI benefits from an offline calibration phase that allows for minimal
overhead during deployment and delivers actionable results rooted in
established theoretical foundations. Empirical tests conducted on real
operational data derived from water distribution and sewerage systems confirm
CoCAI's effectiveness in accurately forecasting target sequences of data and in
identifying anomalous segments within them.

Conclusion: GenSelect有效结合了LLM的比较优势，并在大规模采样预算下高效扩展。

Abstract: Generative reward models with parallel sampling have enabled effective
test-time scaling for reasoning tasks. Current approaches employ pointwise
scoring of individual solutions or pairwise comparisons. However, pointwise
methods underutilize LLMs' comparative abilities, while pairwise methods scale
inefficiently with larger sampling budgets. We introduce GenSelect, where the
LLM uses long reasoning to select the best solution among N candidates. This
leverages LLMs' comparative strengths while scaling efficiently across parallel
sampling budgets. For math reasoning, we demonstrate that reasoning models,
such as QwQ and DeepSeek-R1-0528, excel at GenSelect, outperforming existing
scoring approaches with simple prompting.

Conclusion: WGAN框架不仅提升了降水降尺度的视觉真实感，还为降水数据集的评估和质量控制提供了新思路。

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) precipitation prediction is essential for reducing
damage from stationary and localized heavy rainfall; however, HR precipitation
forecasts using process-driven numerical weather prediction models remains
challenging. This study proposes using Wasserstein Generative Adversarial
Network (WGAN) to perform precipitation downscaling with an optimal transport
cost. In contrast to a conventional neural network trained with mean squared
error, the WGAN generated visually realistic precipitation fields with
fine-scale structures even though the WGAN exhibited slightly lower performance
on conventional evaluation metrics. The learned critic of WGAN correlated well
with human perceptual realism. Case-based analysis revealed that large
discrepancies in critic scores can help identify both unrealistic WGAN outputs
and potential artifacts in the reference data. These findings suggest that the
WGAN framework not only improves perceptual realism in precipitation
downscaling but also offers a new perspective for evaluating and
quality-controlling precipitation datasets.

TL;DR: ARBoids结合深度强化学习与Boids模型，提出一种自适应残差强化学习框架，用于拦截机动性更强的敌方无人水面舰艇，性能优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 敌方无人水面舰艇（USV）机动性优于防御方时，传统拦截策略效果不佳，需开发更高效的拦截方法。

Method: 提出ARBoids框架，结合Boids模型的力基多智能体协调与深度强化学习（DRL）的残差策略，优化防御方行动。

Result: 在高仿真Gazebo环境中验证，ARBoids性能优于纯力基方法和普通DRL策略，且对敌方不同机动性表现强适应性。

Conclusion: ARBoids框架在拦截机动性强的敌方USV时表现出色，具有鲁棒性和泛化能力，代码将公开。

Abstract: The target defense problem (TDP) for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs)
concerns intercepting an adversarial USV before it breaches a designated target
region, using one or more defending USVs. A particularly challenging scenario
arises when the attacker exhibits superior maneuverability compared to the
defenders, significantly complicating effective interception. To tackle this
challenge, this letter introduces ARBoids, a novel adaptive residual
reinforcement learning framework that integrates deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) with the biologically inspired, force-based Boids model. Within this
framework, the Boids model serves as a computationally efficient baseline
policy for multi-agent coordination, while DRL learns a residual policy to
adaptively refine and optimize the defenders' actions. The proposed approach is
validated in a high-fidelity Gazebo simulation environment, demonstrating
superior performance over traditional interception strategies, including pure
force-based approaches and vanilla DRL policies. Furthermore, the learned
policy exhibits strong adaptability to attackers with diverse maneuverability
profiles, highlighting its robustness and generalization capability. The code
of ARBoids will be released upon acceptance of this letter.

Result: 在20个零样本实验中，生成更多样且成功的分子设计。

Conclusion: 分子任务算术简单高效，有望成为分子设计的标准迁移学习策略。

Abstract: The scarcity of molecules with desirable properties (i.e., 'positive'
molecules) is an inherent bottleneck for generative molecule design. To
sidestep such obstacle, here we propose molecular task arithmetic: training a
model on diverse and abundant negative examples to learn 'property directions'
$--$ without accessing any positively labeled data $--$ and moving models in
the opposite property directions to generate positive molecules. When analyzed
on 20 zero-shot design experiments, molecular task arithmetic generated more
diverse and successful designs than models trained on positive molecules.
Moreover, we employed molecular task arithmetic in dual-objective and few-shot
design tasks. We find that molecular task arithmetic can consistently increase
the diversity of designs while maintaining desirable design properties. With
its simplicity, data efficiency, and performance, molecular task arithmetic
bears the potential to become the $\textit{de-facto}$ transfer learning
strategy for de novo molecule design.

Result: MFNO在分辨率泛化上表现优异，生成样本路径速度远超经典数值方法。

Conclusion: MFNO在理论和实践中均表现出色，为随机系统建模提供了高效工具。

Abstract: This paper introduces an operator-based neural network, the mirror-padded
Fourier neural operator (MFNO), designed to learn the dynamics of stochastic
systems. MFNO extends the standard Fourier neural operator (FNO) by
incorporating mirror padding, enabling it to handle non-periodic inputs. We
rigorously prove that MFNOs can approximate solutions of path-dependent
stochastic differential equations and Lipschitz transformations of fractional
Brownian motions to an arbitrary degree of accuracy. Our theoretical analysis
builds on Wong--Zakai type theorems and various approximation techniques.
Empirically, the MFNO exhibits strong resolution generalization--a property
rarely seen in standard architectures such as LSTMs, TCNs, and DeepONet.
Furthermore, our model achieves performance that is comparable or superior to
these baselines while offering significantly faster sample path generation than
classical numerical schemes.

Method: 扩展已知下界，分析高斯均值估计和线性回归中分布偏移的影响。

Result: 小偏移时需大量数据估计私有参数，大偏移时公共数据无益。

Conclusion: 分布偏移程度决定了公共数据在差分隐私学习中的有效性。

Abstract: The most effective differentially private machine learning algorithms in
practice rely on an additional source of purportedly public data. This paradigm
is most interesting when the two sources combine to be more than the sum of
their parts. However, there are settings such as mean estimation where we have
strong lower bounds, showing that when the two data sources have the same
distribution, there is no complementary value to combining the two data
sources. In this work we extend the known lower bounds for public-private
learning to setting where the two data sources exhibit significant distribution
shift. Our results apply to both Gaussian mean estimation where the two
distributions have different means, and to Gaussian linear regression where the
two distributions exhibit parameter shift. We find that when the shift is small
(relative to the desired accuracy), either public or private data must be
sufficiently abundant to estimate the private parameter. Conversely, when the
shift is large, public data provides no benefit.

Motivation: 传统机器学习需要数据集中存储，而FL通过分布式设备训练共享模型，解决了数据隐私和计算资源限制的问题，尤其在云机器人操作中具有潜力。

Result: FL为云机器人操作提供了灵活性和可靠性，但也带来了效率和可扩展性等挑战。

Conclusion: FL在云机器人操作中具有广阔前景，但需进一步研究以解决实际应用中的挑战。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging distributed machine learning paradigm,
where the collaborative training of a model involves dynamic participation of
devices to achieve broad objectives. In contrast, classical machine learning
(ML) typically requires data to be located on-premises for training, whereas FL
leverages numerous user devices to train a shared global model without the need
to share private data. Current robotic manipulation tasks are constrained by
the individual capabilities and speed of robots due to limited low-latency
computing resources. Consequently, the concept of cloud robotics has emerged,
allowing robotic applications to harness the flexibility and reliability of
computing resources, effectively alleviating their computational demands across
the cloud-edge continuum. Undoubtedly, within this distributed computing
context, as exemplified in cloud robotic manipulation scenarios, FL offers
manifold advantages while also presenting several challenges and opportunities.
In this paper, we present fundamental concepts of FL and their connection to
cloud robotic manipulation. Additionally, we envision the opportunities and
challenges associated with realizing efficient and reliable cloud robotic
manipulation at scale through FL, where researchers adopt to design and verify
FL models in either centralized or decentralized settings.

Conclusion: 该方法为生成具有目标特性的新材料提供了高效工具，数据集和代码将开源以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: The ultimate aim of the study is to explore the inverse design of porous
metamaterials using a deep learning-based generative framework. Specifically,
we develop a property-variational autoencoder (pVAE), a variational autoencoder
(VAE) augmented with a regressor, to generate structured metamaterials with
tailored hydraulic properties, such as porosity and permeability. While this
work uses the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) to generate intrinsic permeability
tensor data for limited porous microstructures, a convolutional neural network
(CNN) is trained using a bottom-up approach to predict effective hydraulic
properties. This significantly reduces the computational cost compared to
direct LBM simulations. The pVAE framework is trained on two datasets: a
synthetic dataset of artificial porous microstructures and CT-scan images of
volume elements from real open-cell foams. The encoder-decoder architecture of
the VAE captures key microstructural features, mapping them into a compact and
interpretable latent space for efficient structure-property exploration. The
study provides a detailed analysis and interpretation of the latent space,
demonstrating its role in structure-property mapping, interpolation, and
inverse design. This approach facilitates the generation of new metamaterials
with desired properties. The datasets and codes used in this study will be made
open-access to support further research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释SOTA神经网络的性能，并量化其层质量指标（如alpha和alpha-hat），无需依赖训练或测试数据。

Method: 结合统计力学、随机矩阵理论和量子化学方法，推导SETOL理论，并通过3层MLP和SOTA神经网络验证。

Result: SETOL理论预测与实验数据高度一致，ERG指标与HTSR的alpha指标表现相似。

Conclusion: SETOL为神经网络学习提供了新的理论框架，并验证了其在实际模型中的有效性。

Abstract: We present a SemiEmpirical Theory of Learning (SETOL) that explains the
remarkable performance of State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) Neural Networks (NNs). We
provide a formal explanation of the origin of the fundamental quantities in the
phenomenological theory of Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HTSR): the
heavy-tailed power-law layer quality metrics, alpha and alpha-hat. In prior
work, these metrics have been shown to predict trends in the test accuracies of
pretrained SOTA NN models, importantly, without needing access to either
testing or training data. Our SETOL uses techniques from statistical mechanics
as well as advanced methods from random matrix theory and quantum chemistry.
The derivation suggests new mathematical preconditions for ideal learning,
including a new metric, ERG, which is equivalent to applying a single step of
the Wilson Exact Renormalization Group. We test the assumptions and predictions
of SETOL on a simple 3-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP), demonstrating
excellent agreement with the key theoretical assumptions. For SOTA NN models,
we show how to estimate the individual layer qualities of a trained NN by
simply computing the empirical spectral density (ESD) of the layer weight
matrices and plugging this ESD into our SETOL formulas. Notably, we examine the
performance of the HTSR alpha and the SETOL ERG layer quality metrics, and find
that they align remarkably well, both on our MLP and on SOTA NNs.

Motivation: 当前对抗性提示数据集要么规模小且不平衡（人类编写），要么缺乏真实性和创意（机器生成），需要一种结合两者优势的方法。

Method: 提出Seed2Harvest方法，通过引导扩展人类编写的对抗性提示种子，生成既保留人类创意又具备规模的数据集。

Conclusion: 人机协作能够结合人类创意和机器计算能力，为文本到图像模型的安全性评估提供全面且可扩展的红队测试。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have become prevalent across numerous
applications, making their robust evaluation against adversarial attacks a
critical priority. Continuous access to new and challenging adversarial prompts
across diverse domains is essential for stress-testing these models for
resilience against novel attacks from multiple vectors. Current techniques for
generating such prompts are either entirely authored by humans or synthetically
generated. On the one hand, datasets of human-crafted adversarial prompts are
often too small in size and imbalanced in their cultural and contextual
representation. On the other hand, datasets of synthetically-generated prompts
achieve scale, but typically lack the realistic nuances and creative
adversarial strategies found in human-crafted prompts. To combine the strengths
of both human and machine approaches, we propose Seed2Harvest, a hybrid
red-teaming method for guided expansion of culturally diverse, human-crafted
adversarial prompt seeds. The resulting prompts preserve the characteristics
and attack patterns of human prompts while maintaining comparable average
attack success rates (0.31 NudeNet, 0.36 SD NSFW, 0.12 Q16). Our expanded
dataset achieves substantially higher diversity with 535 unique geographic
locations and a Shannon entropy of 7.48, compared to 58 locations and 5.28
entropy in the original dataset. Our work demonstrates the importance of
human-machine collaboration in leveraging human creativity and machine
computational capacity to achieve comprehensive, scalable red-teaming for
continuous T2I model safety evaluation.

Motivation: 现有方法在人口流动预测中存在静态空间假设、跨城市泛化能力不足、计算成本高和空间结构捕捉不充分等问题，限制了城市范围分析的实用性。

Method: UrbanPulse采用时间图卷积编码器和基于Transformer的解码器建模多尺度时空依赖，并通过三阶段迁移学习策略（预训练、冷启动适应和强化学习微调）实现跨城市泛化。

Result: 在加州三个大都市区的1.03亿条GPS记录上测试，UrbanPulse实现了最先进的准确性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: UrbanPulse通过高效迁移学习，为高分辨率AI城市预测在不同城市的实际部署迈出了关键一步。

Abstract: Accurate population flow prediction is essential for urban planning,
transportation management, and public health. Yet existing methods face key
limitations: traditional models rely on static spatial assumptions, deep
learning models struggle with cross-city generalization, and Large Language
Models (LLMs) incur high computational costs while failing to capture spatial
structure. Moreover, many approaches sacrifice resolution by clustering Points
of Interest (POIs) or restricting coverage to subregions, limiting their
utility for city-wide analytics. We introduce UrbanPulse, a scalable deep
learning framework that delivers ultra-fine-grained, city-wide OD flow
predictions by treating each POI as an individual node. It combines a temporal
graph convolutional encoder with a transformer-based decoder to model
multi-scale spatiotemporal dependencies. To ensure robust generalization across
urban contexts, UrbanPulse employs a three-stage transfer learning strategy:
pretraining on large-scale urban graphs, cold-start adaptation, and
reinforcement learning fine-tuning.Evaluated on over 103 million cleaned GPS
records from three metropolitan areas in California, UrbanPulse achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy and scalability. Through efficient transfer learning,
UrbanPulse takes a key step toward making high-resolution, AI-powered urban
forecasting deployable in practice across diverse cities.

system leverages the XIAO-nRF52840 Sense microcontroller and the LSM6DS3 IMU
sensor to capture motion data, including acceleration and angular velocity,
from four distinct activities: walking, stationary, going upstairs, and going
downstairs. The data collected is processed through Edge Impulse, an edge AI
platform, which enables the training of machine learning models that can be
deployed directly onto the microcontroller for real-time activity
classification.The data preprocessing step involves extracting relevant
features from the raw sensor data using techniques such as sliding windows and
data normalization, followed by training a Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifier
for activity recognition. The model achieves over 80% accuracy on a test
dataset, demonstrating its ability to classify the four activities effectively.
Additionally, the platform enables anomaly detection, further enhancing the
robustness of the system. The integration of Tiny ML ensures low-power
operation, making it suitable for battery-powered or energy-harvesting devices.

Method: MFTRR框架包含局部-全局语义关联推理模块和多层次证据关系推理模块，结合多模态数据和排名任务。

Result: 在三个新构建的数据集和公开数据集上，MFTRR显著优于基线方法，NDCG@3提升最高达9.52%。

Conclusion: MFTRR通过模仿人类认知过程，有效解决了帖子质量评估中的关键问题，为多模态关系推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Accurately assessing post quality requires complex relational reasoning to
capture nuanced topic-post relationships. However, existing studies face three
major limitations: (1) treating the task as unimodal categorization, which
fails to leverage multimodal cues and fine-grained quality distinctions; (2)
introducing noise during deep multimodal fusion, leading to misleading signals;
and (3) lacking the ability to capture complex semantic relationships like
relevance and comprehensiveness. To address these issues, we propose the
Multimodal Fine-grained Topic-post Relational Reasoning (MFTRR) framework,
which mimics human cognitive processes. MFTRR reframes post-quality assessment
as a ranking task and incorporates multimodal data to better capture quality
variations. It consists of two key modules: (1) the Local-Global Semantic
Correlation Reasoning Module, which models fine-grained semantic interactions
between posts and topics at both local and global levels, enhanced by a maximum
information fusion mechanism to suppress noise; and (2) the Multi-Level
Evidential Relational Reasoning Module, which explores macro- and micro-level
relational cues to strengthen evidence-based reasoning. We evaluate MFTRR on
three newly constructed multimodal topic-post datasets and the public
Lazada-Home dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that MFTRR significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 9.52% NDCG@3
improvement over the best unimodal method on the Art History dataset.

Abstract: Accurate modeling and explaining geospatial tabular data (GTD) are critical
for understanding geospatial phenomena and their underlying processes. Recent
work has proposed a novel transformer-based deep learning model named
GeoAggregator (GA) for this purpose, and has demonstrated that it outperforms
other statistical and machine learning approaches. In this short paper, we
further improve GA by 1) developing an optimized pipeline that accelerates the
dataloading process and streamlines the forward pass of GA to achieve better
computational efficiency; and 2) incorporating a model ensembling strategy and
a post-hoc model explanation function based on the GeoShapley framework to
enhance model explainability. We validate the functionality and efficiency of
the proposed strategies by applying the improved GA model to synthetic
datasets. Experimental results show that our implementation improves the
prediction accuracy and inference speed of GA compared to the original
implementation. Moreover, explanation experiments indicate that GA can
effectively captures the inherent spatial effects in the designed synthetic
dataset. The complete pipeline has been made publicly available for community
use (https://github.com/ruid7181/GA-sklearn).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医疗等领域的表格数据偏移问题，同时应对隐私限制和复杂噪声的挑战。

Method: 提取隐私合规统计摘要，使用双XGBoost模型和LLM辅助去噪，通过Pareto加权决策树合并结果。

Result: 在MEPS数据集上F1得分为0.85，优于基线方法；在18个EHR数据集上F1为0.86-0.96（无噪声）和≥0.75（有噪声）。

Conclusion: SIFOTL提供了一种可解释、隐私保护且对噪声鲁棒的工作流程。

Abstract: Identifying the factors driving data shifts in tabular datasets is a
significant challenge for analysis and decision support systems, especially
those focusing on healthcare. Privacy rules restrict data access, and noise
from complex processes hinders analysis. To address this challenge, we propose
SIFOTL (Statistically-Informed Fidelity-Optimization Method for Tabular
Learning) that (i) extracts privacy-compliant data summary statistics, (ii)
employs twin XGBoost models to disentangle intervention signals from noise with
assistance from LLMs, and (iii) merges XGBoost outputs via a Pareto-weighted
decision tree to identify interpretable segments responsible for the shift.
Unlike existing analyses which may ignore noise or require full data access for
LLM-based analysis, SIFOTL addresses both challenges using only privacy-safe
summary statistics. Demonstrating its real-world efficacy, for a MEPS panel
dataset mimicking a new Medicare drug subsidy, SIFOTL achieves an F1 score of
0.85, substantially outperforming BigQuery Contribution Analysis (F1=0.46) and
statistical tests (F1=0.20) in identifying the segment receiving the subsidy.
Furthermore, across 18 diverse EHR datasets generated based on Synthea ABM,
SIFOTL sustains F1 scores of 0.86-0.96 without noise and >= 0.75 even with
injected observational noise, whereas baseline average F1 scores range from
0.19-0.67 under the same tests. SIFOTL, therefore, provides an interpretable,
privacy-conscious workflow that is empirically robust to observational noise.

methods, it also raises concerns regarding privacy, cybersecurity, and data
freshness. These issues can erode public trust in intelligent transportation
systems. Recently, regulations have introduced the "right to be forgotten",
allowing users to request the removal of their private data from models. As
machine learning models can remember old data, simply removing it from back-end
databases is insufficient in such systems. To address these challenges, this
study introduces a novel learning paradigm for TSEP-Machine Unlearning
TSEP-which enables a trained TSEP model to selectively forget
privacy-sensitive, poisoned, or outdated data. By empowering models to
"unlearn," we aim to enhance the trustworthiness and reliability of data-driven
traffic TSEP.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于强化学习的LLM微调计算成本高的问题。

Method: 提出预测框架，建模训练动态，并通过实验总结出基于模型大小、初始性能和训练进度的经验规律。

Result: 发现训练分为三个阶段（缓慢启动、快速提升、平台期），并证明提前停止可减少计算成本而不影响性能。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于多种模型类型，为高效GRPO微调提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for reasoning tasks using
reinforcement learning methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
is computationally expensive. To address this, we propose a predictive
framework that models training dynamics and helps optimize resource usage.
Through experiments on Llama and Qwen models (3B 8B), we derive an empirical
scaling law based on model size, initial performance, and training progress.
This law predicts reward trajectories and identifies three consistent training
phases: slow start, rapid improvement, and plateau. We find that training
beyond certain number of an epoch offers little gain, suggesting earlier
stopping can significantly reduce compute without sacrificing performance. Our
approach generalizes across model types, providing a practical guide for
efficient GRPO-based fine-tuning.

Motivation: 海洋学中高分辨率数据对沿海管理、环境监测和海上安全至关重要，但现有卫星数据（如Copernicus）和全球海洋模型的空间分辨率不足。

Method: 采用监督深度学习框架和神经算子，提出降尺度模型，可建模替代PDE并在任意分辨率下预测解。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效解决高分辨率需求问题，并适用于任意输入分辨率的预测。

Abstract: Accurate modeling of physical systems governed by partial differential
equations is a central challenge in scientific computing. In oceanography,
high-resolution current data are critical for coastal management, environmental
monitoring, and maritime safety. However, available satellite products, such as
Copernicus data for sea water velocity at ~0.08 degrees spatial resolution and
global ocean models, often lack the spatial granularity required for detailed
local analyses. In this work, we (a) introduce a supervised deep learning
framework based on neural operators for solving PDEs and providing arbitrary
resolution solutions, and (b) propose downscaling models with an application to
Copernicus ocean current data. Additionally, our method can model surrogate
PDEs and predict solutions at arbitrary resolution, regardless of the input
resolution. We evaluated our model on real-world Copernicus ocean current data
and synthetic Navier-Stokes simulation datasets.

performs sequence-level clipping, rewarding, and optimization. We demonstrate
that GSPO achieves superior training efficiency and performance compared to the

TL;DR: C-AAE结合匿名自编码器和差分编码技术，有效保护用户隐私并减少数据量，同时保持活动识别的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可穿戴设备的行为数据可能泄露用户身份，隐私保护对医疗应用至关重要。

Method: C-AAE结合匿名自编码器（AAE）和自适应差分脉冲编码调制（ADPCM），先提取活动特征并抑制身份信息，再进一步压缩数据。

Result: 实验显示，C-AAE将用户重识别F1分数降低10-15%，数据量减少75%，活动识别F1分数仅下降5%。

Conclusion: C-AAE在医疗传感器数据中实现了隐私保护与实用性的平衡。

Abstract: Wearable accelerometers and gyroscopes encode fine-grained behavioural
signatures that can be exploited to re-identify users, making privacy
protection essential for healthcare applications. We introduce C-AAE, a
compressive anonymizing autoencoder that marries an Anonymizing AutoEncoder
(AAE) with Adaptive Differential Pulse-Code Modulation (ADPCM). The AAE first
projects raw sensor windows into a latent space that retains activity-relevant
features while suppressing identity cues. ADPCM then differentially encodes
this latent stream, further masking residual identity information and shrinking
the bitrate. Experiments on the MotionSense and PAMAP2 datasets show that C-AAE
cuts user re-identification F1 scores by 10-15 percentage points relative to
AAE alone, while keeping activity-recognition F1 within 5 percentage points of
the unprotected baseline. ADPCM also reduces data volume by roughly 75 %,
easing transmission and storage overheads. These results demonstrate that C-AAE
offers a practical route to balancing privacy and utility in continuous,
sensor-based activity recognition for healthcare.

TL;DR: Squeeze10-LLM 是一种分阶段混合精度的后训练量化框架，通过将80%的权重量化为1位、20%量化为4位，平均每权重1.6位，显著减少存储和加速推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）部署面临参数庞大和计算成本高的问题，极低比特量化虽能减少存储和加速推理，但极端压缩会导致性能严重下降。

Method: 提出 Squeeze10-LLM，结合后二值化激活鲁棒性（PBAR）和全信息激活监督（FIAS）两种创新方法，优化量化效果。

Result: 在 LLaMA 和 LLaMA2 上实验，Squeeze10-LLM 在子2位权重量化中达到最先进性能，零样本分类任务准确率从43%提升至56%。

Conclusion: Squeeze10-LLM 显著提升了极低比特量化的性能，为 LLM 部署提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) is challenging due to their massive
parameters and high computational costs. Ultra low-bit quantization can
significantly reduce storage and accelerate inference, but extreme compression
(i.e., mean bit-width <= 2) often leads to severe performance degradation. To
address this, we propose Squeeze10-LLM, effectively "squeezing" 16-bit LLMs'
weights by 10 times. Specifically, Squeeze10-LLM is a staged mixed-precision
post-training quantization (PTQ) framework and achieves an average of 1.6 bits
per weight by quantizing 80% of the weights to 1 bit and 20% to 4 bits. We
introduce Squeeze10LLM with two key innovations: Post-Binarization Activation
Robustness (PBAR) and Full Information Activation Supervision (FIAS). PBAR is a
refined weight significance metric that accounts for the impact of quantization
on activations, improving accuracy in low-bit settings. FIAS is a strategy that
preserves full activation information during quantization to mitigate
cumulative error propagation across layers. Experiments on LLaMA and LLaMA2
show that Squeeze10-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance for sub-2bit
weight-only quantization, improving average accuracy from 43% to 56% on six
zero-shot classification tasks--a significant boost over existing PTQ methods.
Our code will be released upon publication.

Motivation: 在数据稀缺或标注成本高的场景中，如何利用额外监督信息（如置信度）提升分类模型的准确性是一个关键问题。

Method: 将硬标签和额外监督信息视为概率分布，通过它们的仿射组合构建软标签，并分析额外监督信息对软标签优化的作用。

Conclusion: 额外监督信息和混合系数在优化软标签中起互补作用，理论框架为设计有效的监督信息提供了指导。

Abstract: In scenarios where training data is limited due to observation costs or data
scarcity, enriching the label information associated with each instance becomes
crucial for building high-accuracy classification models. In such contexts, it
is often feasible to obtain not only hard labels but also {\it additional
supervision}, such as the confidences for the hard labels. This setting
naturally raises fundamental questions: {\it What kinds of additional
supervision are intrinsically beneficial?} And {\it how do they contribute to
improved generalization performance?} To address these questions, we propose a
theoretical framework that treats both hard labels and additional supervision
as probability distributions, and constructs soft labels through their affine
combination. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the essential component of
additional supervision is not the confidence score of the assigned hard label,
but rather the information of the distribution over the non-hard-labeled
classes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the additional supervision and the
mixing coefficient contribute to the refinement of soft labels in complementary
roles. Intuitively, in the probability simplex, the additional supervision
determines the direction in which the deterministic distribution representing
the hard label should be adjusted toward the true label distribution, while the
mixing coefficient controls the step size along that direction. Through
generalization error analysis, we theoretically characterize how the additional
supervision and its mixing coefficient affect both the convergence rate and
asymptotic value of the error bound. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate
that, based on our theory, designing additional supervision can lead to
improved classification accuracy, even when utilized in a simple manner.

Result: PDA-DRL方法比优化平均延迟约束的DRL模型降低了38%的平均延迟，且个性化权重共享方法优于传统聚合方法。

Conclusion: PDA-DRL方法在延迟优化和资源分配方面表现出色，个性化权重共享技术为多MVNOs协作提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the challenge of radio access network (RAN) slicing
within an open RAN (O-RAN) architecture. Our focus centers on a network that
includes multiple mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) competing for
physical resource blocks (PRBs) with the goal of meeting probabilistic delay
upper bound constraints for their clients while minimizing PRB utilization.
Initially, we derive a reward function based on the law of large numbers (LLN),
then implement practical modifications to adapt it for real-world experimental
scenarios. We then propose our solution, the Percentile-based Delay-Aware Deep
Reinforcement Learning (PDA-DRL), which demonstrates its superiority over
several baselines, including DRL models optimized for average delay
constraints, by achieving a 38\% reduction in resultant average delay.
Furthermore, we delve into the issue of model weight sharing among multiple
MVNOs to develop a robust personalized model. We introduce a reward-based
personalization method where each agent prioritizes other agents' model weights
based on their performance. This technique surpasses traditional aggregation
methods, such as federated averaging, and strategies reliant on traffic
patterns and model weight distance similarities.

Conclusion: 该方法有效诱导目标代理做出次优决策，且无需环境修改，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in fields like
robotics and autonomous driving, but adversarial attacks designed to mislead RL
systems remain challenging. Existing approaches often rely on modifying the
environment or policy, limiting their practicality. This paper proposes an
adversarial attack method in which existing agents in the environment guide the
target policy to output suboptimal actions without altering the environment. We
propose a reward iteration optimization framework that leverages large language
models (LLMs) to generate adversarial rewards explicitly tailored to the
vulnerabilities of the target agent, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of
inducing the target agent toward suboptimal decision-making. Additionally, a
critical state identification algorithm is designed to pinpoint the target
agent's most vulnerable states, where suboptimal behavior from the victim leads
to significant degradation in overall performance. Experimental results in
diverse environments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing
approaches.

Motivation: 探索语言模型在数学推理任务中如何通过自身置信度实现性能提升，减少对外部验证的依赖。

Method: 使用前缀置信度选择最有可能的尝试，并在五个数学推理数据集（GSM8K、MATH500、AMC23、AIME24、AIME25）上评估其效果。

Result: 前缀置信度缩放（仅32个标记）在准确性与计算效率上优于多数投票，且对长度偏差的敏感性较低。

Conclusion: 前缀置信度缩放是一种高效的方法，优于多数投票和测试时训练，但测试时训练未超越前缀置信度缩放。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that language models can self-improve by maximizing
their own confidence in their predictions, without relying on external
verifiers or reward signals. In this work, we study the test-time scaling of
language models for mathematical reasoning tasks, where the model's own
confidence is used to select the most promising attempts. Surprisingly, we find
that we can achieve significant performance gains by continuing only the most
promising attempt, selected by the model's prefix-confidence. We systematically
evaluate prefix-confidence scaling on five mathematical reasoning datasets: the
school-level GSM8K and MATH500, and the competition-level AMC23, AIME24, and
AIME25. We find that prefix-confidence scaling with prefixes of only 32 tokens
achieves a better accuracy-compute trade-off than majority voting. Moreover,
prefix-confidence scaling appears less susceptible than BoN to length biases.
Finally, we also evaluate test-time training with prefix-confidence and find
that, while outperforming the base model, it does not improve over
prefix-confidence scaling.

Abstract: Class-imbalanced graph node classification is a practical yet underexplored
research problem. Although recent studies have attempted to address this issue,
they typically assume clean and reliable labels when processing
class-imbalanced graphs. This assumption often violates the nature of
real-world graphs, where labels frequently contain noise. Given this gap, this
paper systematically investigates robust node classification for
class-imbalanced graphs with noisy labels. We propose GraphALP, a novel Graph
Augmentation framework based on Large language models (LLMs) and
Pseudo-labeling techniques. Specifically, we design an LLM-based oversampling
method to generate synthetic minority nodes, producing label-accurate minority
nodes to alleviate class imbalance. Based on the class-balanced graphs, we
develop a dynamically weighted pseudo-labeling method to obtain high-confidence
pseudo labels to reduce label noise ratio. Additionally, we implement a
secondary LLM-guided oversampling mechanism to mitigate potential class
distribution skew caused by pseudo labels. Experimental results show that
GraphALP achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on
class-imbalanced graphs with noisy labels.

Result: 理论证明框架在噪声条件下的收敛性和稳定性，实验验证其在合成和真实数据集上的先进性能。

Conclusion: ChronoSelect通过动态时间分析显著提升了噪声标签下的学习效果，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks on real-world datasets is often hampered by the
presence of noisy labels, which can be memorized by over-parameterized models,
leading to significant degradation in generalization performance. While
existing methods for learning with noisy labels (LNL) have made considerable
progress, they fundamentally suffer from static snapshot evaluations and fail
to leverage the rich temporal dynamics of learning evolution. In this paper, we
propose ChronoSelect (chrono denoting its temporal nature), a novel framework
featuring an innovative four-stage memory architecture that compresses
prediction history into compact temporal distributions. Our unique sliding
update mechanism with controlled decay maintains only four dynamic memory units
per sample, progressively emphasizing recent patterns while retaining essential
historical knowledge. This enables precise three-way sample partitioning into
clean, boundary, and noisy subsets through temporal trajectory analysis and
dual-branch consistency. Theoretical guarantees prove the mechanism's
convergence and stability under noisy conditions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate ChronoSelect's state-of-the-art performance across synthetic and
real-world benchmarks.

Result: 在跨数据集评估（Argoverse2训练，NuScenes测试）中展示了目标选择过程的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法在未见场景中表现更好，提升了自动驾驶预测模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: To achieve full autonomous driving, a good understanding of the surrounding
environment is necessary. Especially predicting the future states of other
traffic participants imposes a non-trivial challenge. Current SotA-models
already show promising results when trained on real datasets (e.g. Argoverse2,
NuScenes). Problems arise when these models are deployed to new/unseen areas.
Typically, performance drops significantly, indicating that the models lack
generalization. In this work, we introduce a new Graph Neural Network (GNN)
that utilizes a heterogeneous graph consisting of traffic participants and
vectorized road network. Latter, is used to classify goals, i.e. endpoints of
the predicted trajectories, in a multi-staged approach, leading to a better
generalization to unseen scenarios. We show the effectiveness of the goal
selection process via cross-dataset evaluation, i.e. training on Argoverse2 and
evaluating on NuScenes.

Motivation: 现有联邦图学习方法依赖同步通信效率低，而异步方法未考虑图形数据的拓扑特性，可能导致语义漂移和表示不一致。

Method: 提出FedSA-GCL框架，结合客户端标签分布差异和图拓扑特性，通过ClusterCast机制实现高效训练。

Conclusion: FedSA-GCL在效率和鲁棒性上表现优异，解决了联邦图学习中的关键问题。

Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is a distributed learning paradigm that
enables collaborative training over large-scale subgraphs located on multiple
local systems. However, most existing FGL approaches rely on synchronous
communication, which leads to inefficiencies and is often impractical in
real-world deployments. Meanwhile, current asynchronous federated learning
(AFL) methods are primarily designed for conventional tasks such as image
classification and natural language processing, without accounting for the
unique topological properties of graph data. Directly applying these methods to
graph learning can possibly result in semantic drift and representational
inconsistency in the global model. To address these challenges, we propose
FedSA-GCL, a semi-asynchronous federated framework that leverages both
inter-client label distribution divergence and graph topological
characteristics through a novel ClusterCast mechanism for efficient training.
We evaluate FedSA-GCL on multiple real-world graph datasets using the Louvain
and Metis split algorithms, and compare it against 9 baselines. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves strong robustness and
outstanding efficiency, outperforming the baselines by an average of 2.92% with
the Louvain and by 3.4% with the Metis.

Result: SINDy-LOM在柴油发动机空气路径系统中验证了其有效性，模型更简洁且可靠。

Conclusion: SINDy-LOM显著减轻用户负担，提升模型可靠性，适用于复杂系统。

Abstract: The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) approach can discover
the governing equations of dynamical systems based on measurement data, where
the dynamical model is identified as the sparse linear combination of the given
basis functions. A major challenge in SINDy is the design of a library, which
is a set of candidate basis functions, as the appropriate library is not
trivial for many dynamical systems. To overcome this difficulty, this study
proposes SINDy with library optimization mechanism (SINDy-LOM), which is a
combination of the sparse regression technique and the novel learning strategy
of the library. In the proposed approach, the basis functions are parametrized.
The SINDy-LOM approach involves a two-layer optimization architecture: the
inner-layer, in which the data-driven model is extracted as the sparse linear
combination of the candidate basis functions, and the outer-layer, in which the
basis functions are optimized from the viewpoint of the recursive long-term
(RLT) prediction accuracy; thus, the library design is reformulated as the
optimization of the parametrized basis functions. The resulting SINDy-LOM model
has good interpretability and usability, as the proposed approach yields the
parsimonious model. The library optimization mechanism significantly reduces
user burden. The RLT perspective improves the reliability of the resulting
model compared with the traditional SINDy approach that can only ensure the
one-step-ahead prediction accuracy. The validity of the proposed approach is
demonstrated by applying it to a diesel engine airpath system, which is a
well-known complex industrial system.

Abstract: Despite their theoretical appeal, totally corrective boosting methods based
on linear programming have received limited empirical attention. In this paper,
we conduct the first large-scale experimental study of six LP-based boosting
formulations, including two novel methods, NM-Boost and QRLP-Boost, across 20
diverse datasets. We evaluate the use of both heuristic and optimal base
learners within these formulations, and analyze not only accuracy, but also
ensemble sparsity, margin distribution, anytime performance, and hyperparameter
sensitivity. We show that totally corrective methods can outperform or match
state-of-the-art heuristics like XGBoost and LightGBM when using shallow trees,
while producing significantly sparser ensembles. We further show that these
methods can thin pre-trained ensembles without sacrificing performance, and we
highlight both the strengths and limitations of using optimal decision trees in
this context.

TL;DR: SiamSA-PPM是一种结合Siamese学习和统计增强的自监督学习框架，用于预测性流程监控，通过生成语义有效的轨迹变体提升数据多样性和模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习PPM方法因现实事件日志的低变异性和小规模而受限的问题。

Method: 提出三种基于统计的转换方法，结合Siamese学习框架，生成语义有效的轨迹变体并学习通用表示。

Result: 在真实事件日志上表现优于现有方法，显著提升数据变异性。

Conclusion: SiamSA-PPM为流程预测中的数据增强提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) enables forecasting future events or
outcomes of ongoing business process instances based on event logs. However,
deep learning PPM approaches are often limited by the low variability and small
size of real-world event logs. To address this, we introduce SiamSA-PPM, a
novel self-supervised learning framework that combines Siamese learning with
Statistical Augmentation for Predictive Process Monitoring. It employs three
novel statistically grounded transformation methods that leverage control-flow
semantics and frequent behavioral patterns to generate realistic, semantically
valid new trace variants. These augmented views are used within a Siamese
learning setup to learn generalizable representations of process prefixes
without the need for labeled supervision. Extensive experiments on real-life
event logs demonstrate that SiamSA-PPM achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to the SOTA in both next activity and final outcome
prediction tasks. Our results further show that statistical augmentation
significantly outperforms random transformations and improves variability in
the data, highlighting SiamSA-PPM as a promising direction for training data
enrichment in process prediction.

Result: 在两种PDE（线性抛物方程和波动方程）上测试，网格点减少10倍，同时保留关键点动态。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于任意由演化偏微分方程描述的系统。

Abstract: Due to the high computational load of modern numerical simulation, there is a
demand for approaches that would reduce the size of discrete problems while
keeping the accuracy reasonable. In this work, we present an original algorithm
to coarsen an unstructured grid based on the concepts of differentiable
physics. We achieve this by employing k-means clustering, autodifferentiation
and stochastic minimization algorithms. We demonstrate performance of the
designed algorithm on two PDEs: a linear parabolic equation which governs
slightly compressible fluid flow in porous media and the wave equation. Our
results show that in the considered scenarios, we reduced the number of grid
points up to 10 times while preserving the modeled variable dynamics in the
points of interest. The proposed approach can be applied to the simulation of
an arbitrary system described by evolutionary partial differential equations.

Conclusion: 论文提出的方法解决了持续学习中安全回归的关键问题，为恶意软件检测的可靠更新提供了支持。

Abstract: Malware evolves rapidly, forcing machine learning (ML)-based detectors to
adapt continuously. With antivirus vendors processing hundreds of thousands of
new samples daily, datasets can grow to billions of examples, making full
retraining impractical. Continual learning (CL) has emerged as a scalable
alternative, enabling incremental updates without full data access while
mitigating catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we analyze a critical yet
overlooked issue in this context: security regression. Unlike forgetting, which
manifests as a general performance drop on previously seen data, security
regression captures harmful prediction changes at the sample level, such as a
malware sample that was once correctly detected but evades detection after a
model update. Although often overlooked, regressions pose serious risks in
security-critical applications, as the silent reintroduction of previously
detected threats in the system may undermine users' trust in the whole updating
process. To address this issue, we formalize and quantify security regression
in CL-based malware detectors and propose a regression-aware penalty to
mitigate it. Specifically, we adapt Positive Congruent Training (PCT) to the CL
setting, preserving prior predictive behavior in a model-agnostic manner.
Experiments on the ELSA, Tesseract, and AZ-Class datasets show that our method
effectively reduces regression across different CL scenarios while maintaining
strong detection performance over time.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为TIDSIT的新架构，用于处理电池健康监测中的不规则时间序列数据，显著提高了SoH预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电池健康监测对安全和效率至关重要，但现有模型难以处理实际测量中的不规则性。

Method: 采用时间嵌入和动态序列倒置变换器（TIDSIT），处理非均匀间隔和变长输入。

Result: 在NASA数据集上，TIDSIT将预测误差降低50%以上，SoH误差低于0.58%。

Conclusion: TIDSIT在电池健康监测中表现优异，且适用于其他不规则时间序列任务。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of battery-powered vehicles and energy storage systems
over the past decade has made battery health monitoring increasingly critical.
Batteries play a central role in the efficiency and safety of these systems,
yet they inevitably degrade over time due to repeated charge-discharge cycles.
This degradation leads to reduced energy efficiency and potential overheating,
posing significant safety concerns. Accurate estimation of a State of Health
(SoH) of battery is therefore essential for ensuring operational reliability
and safety. Several machine learning architectures, such as LSTMs,
transformers, and encoder-based models, have been proposed to estimate SoH from
discharge cycle data. However, these models struggle with the irregularities
inherent in real-world measurements: discharge readings are often recorded at
non-uniform intervals, and the lengths of discharge cycles vary significantly.
To address this, most existing approaches extract features from the sequences
rather than processing them in full, which introduces information loss and
compromises accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel
architecture: Time-Informed Dynamic Sequence Inverted Transformer (TIDSIT).
TIDSIT incorporates continuous time embeddings to effectively represent
irregularly sampled data and utilizes padded sequences with temporal attention
mechanisms to manage variable-length inputs without discarding sequence
information. Experimental results on the NASA battery degradation dataset show
that TIDSIT significantly outperforms existing models, achieving over 50%
reduction in prediction error and maintaining an SoH prediction error below
0.58%. Furthermore, the architecture is generalizable and holds promise for
broader applications in health monitoring tasks involving irregular time-series
data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决HyperDeepONets因高参数数量导致的高内存和计算成本问题。

Method: 利用LoRA将超网络的输出层权重矩阵分解为两个低秩矩阵，减少可训练参数并引入额外正则化。

Result: 在常微分和偏微分方程实验中，参数减少70%，预测精度和泛化能力优于常规HyperDeepONets。

Conclusion: PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets在降低复杂度的同时，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: HyperDeepONets were introduced in Lee, Cho and Hwang [ICLR, 2023] as an
alternative architecture for operator learning, in which a hypernetwork
generates the weights for the trunk net of a DeepONet. While this improves
expressivity, it incurs high memory and computational costs due to the large
number of output parameters required. In this work we introduce, in the
physics-informed machine learning setting, a variation, PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets,
which leverage low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to reduce complexity by decomposing
the hypernetwork's output layer weight matrix into two smaller low-rank
matrices. This reduces the number of trainable parameters while introducing an
extra regularization of the trunk networks' weights. Through extensive
experiments on both ordinary and partial differential equations we show that
PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets achieve up to 70\% reduction in parameters and
consistently outperform regular HyperDeepONets in terms of predictive accuracy
and generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准LLMs在不确定性量化方面存在挑战，传统贝叶斯和集成方法计算成本高。

Method: 将需要多次前向传播的教师模型蒸馏为紧凑的学生模型，采用LoRA微调，比较两种蒸馏策略：传统softmax输出和Dirichlet分布输出。

Result: 学生模型在分类数据集上表现与教师模型相当或更优，且仅需单次前向传播。

Conclusion: 首次证明通过证据蒸馏可在LLMs中实现即时且稳健的不确定性量化。

Abstract: Accurate uncertainty quantification remains a key challenge for standard
LLMs, prompting the adoption of Bayesian and ensemble-based methods. However,
such methods typically necessitate computationally expensive sampling,
involving multiple forward passes to effectively estimate predictive
uncertainty.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel approach enabling efficient and effective
uncertainty estimation in LLMs without sacrificing performance. Specifically,
we distill uncertainty-aware teacher models - originally requiring multiple
forward passes - into compact student models sharing the same architecture but
fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). We compare two distinct
distillation strategies: one in which the student employs traditional
softmax-based outputs, and another in which the student leverages
Dirichlet-distributed outputs to explicitly model epistemic uncertainty via
evidential learning.
  Empirical evaluations on classification datasets demonstrate that such
students can achieve comparable or superior predictive and uncertainty
quantification performance relative to their teacher models, while critically
requiring only a single forward pass. To our knowledge, this is the first
demonstration that immediate and robust uncertainty quantification can be
achieved in LLMs through evidential distillation.

Abstract: With the global population growing and arable land resources becoming
increasingly scarce,smart agriculture and precision agriculture have emerged as
key directions for the future ofagricultural development.Artificial
intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly deep learning models, have found
widespread applications in areas such as crop monitoring and pest detection. As
an emerging generative model, diffusion models have shown significant promise
in tasks like agricultural image processing, data augmentation, and remote
sensing. Compared to traditional generative adversarial networks (GANs),
diffusion models offer superior training stability and generation quality,
effectively addressing challenges such as limited agricultural data and
imbalanced image samples. This paper reviews the latest advancements in the
application of diffusion models in agriculture, focusing on their potential in
crop pest and disease detection, remote sensing image enhancement, crop growth
prediction, and agricultural resource management. Experimental results
demonstrate that diffusion models significantly improve model accuracy and
robustness in data augmentation, image generation, and denoising, especially in
complex environments. Despite challenges related to computational efficiency
and generalization capabilities, diffusion models are expected to play an
increasingly important role in smart and precision agriculture as technology
advances, providing substantial support for the sustainable development of
global agriculture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决数据稀缺地区洪水预测和水资源管理中的准确性问题。

Method: 使用贝叶斯模型平均（BMA）结合43个未校准的水文模型，再通过储层计算（RC）进行误差修正。

Result: 在数据丰富和稀缺场景下，HYPER性能优于LSTM，计算效率更高。

Conclusion: HYPER为未测量流域提供了一种高效、通用的流量预测解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the critical need for accurate flood prediction and water management,
many regions lack sufficient river discharge observations, limiting the skill
of rainfall-runoff analyses. Although numerous physically based and machine
learning models exist, achieving high accuracy, interpretability, and
computational efficiency under data-scarce conditions remains a major
challenge. We address this challenge with a novel method, HYdrological
Prediction with multi-model Ensemble and Reservoir computing (HYPER) that
leverages multi-model ensemble and reservoir computing (RC). Our approach first
applies Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to 43 "uncalibrated" catchment-based
conceptual hydrological models. An RC model is then trained via linear
regression to correct errors in the BMA output, a non-iterative process that
ensures high computational efficiency. For ungauged basins, we infer the
required BMA and RC weights by linking them to catchment attributes from gauged
basins, creating a generalizable framework. We evaluated HYPER using data from
87 river basins in Japan. In a data-rich scenario, HYPER (median Kling-Gupta
Efficiency, KGE, of 0.56) performed comparably to a benchmark LSTM (KGE 0.55)
but required only 5% of its computational time. In a data-scarce scenario (23%
of basins gauged), HYPER maintained robust performance (KGE 0.55) and lower
uncertainty, whereas the LSTM's performance degraded significantly (KGE -0.04).
These results reveal that individual conceptual hydrological models do not
necessarily need to be calibrated when an effectively large ensemble is
assembled and combined with machine-learning-based bias correction. HYPER
provides a robust, efficient, and generalizable solution for discharge
prediction, particularly in ungauged basins, making it applicable to a wide
range of regions.

Conclusion: 改进的双模拟度量在理论和实验上均表现出优越性，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Bisimulation metric has long been regarded as an effective control-related
representation learning technique in various reinforcement learning tasks.
However, in this paper, we identify two main issues with the conventional
bisimulation metric: 1) an inability to represent certain distinctive
scenarios, and 2) a reliance on predefined weights for differences in rewards
and subsequent states during recursive updates. We find that the first issue
arises from an imprecise definition of the reward gap, whereas the second issue
stems from overlooking the varying importance of reward difference and
next-state distinctions across different training stages and task settings. To
address these issues, by introducing a measure for state-action pairs, we
propose a revised bisimulation metric that features a more precise definition
of reward gap and novel update operators with adaptive coefficient. We also
offer theoretical guarantees of convergence for our proposed metric and its
improved representation distinctiveness. In addition to our rigorous
theoretical analysis, we conduct extensive experiments on two representative
benchmarks, DeepMind Control and Meta-World, demonstrating the effectiveness of
our approach.

Conclusion: GLANCE为异质图学习提供了高效且可解释的新方法。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant success in
learning from graph-structured data but often struggle on heterophilous graphs,
where connected nodes differ in features or class labels. This limitation
arises from indiscriminate neighbor aggregation and insufficient incorporation
of higher-order structural patterns. To address these challenges, we propose
GLANCE (Graph Logic Attention Network with Cluster Enhancement), a novel
framework that integrates logic-guided reasoning, dynamic graph refinement, and
adaptive clustering to enhance graph representation learning. GLANCE combines a
logic layer for interpretable and structured embeddings, multi-head
attention-based edge pruning for denoising graph structures, and clustering
mechanisms for capturing global patterns. Experimental results in benchmark
datasets, including Cornell, Texas, and Wisconsin, demonstrate that GLANCE
achieves competitive performance, offering robust and interpretable solutions
for heterophilous graph scenarios. The proposed framework is lightweight,
adaptable, and uniquely suited to the challenges of heterophilous graphs.

Abstract: We introduce C2G-KD, a data-free knowledge distillation framework where a
class-conditional generator is trained to produce synthetic samples guided by a
frozen teacher model and geometric constraints derived from PCA. The generator
never observes real training data but instead learns to activate the teacher's
output through a combination of semantic and structural losses. By constraining
generated samples to lie within class-specific PCA subspaces estimated from as
few as two real examples per class, we preserve topological consistency and
diversity. Experiments on MNIST show that even minimal class structure is
sufficient to bootstrap useful synthetic training pipelines.

Conclusion: FMB定律为理解和设计跨学科学习算法提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Diverse learning algorithms, optimization methods, and natural selection
share a common mathematical structure, despite their apparent differences. Here
I show that a simple notational partitioning of change by the Price equation
reveals a universal force-metric-bias (FMB) law: $\Delta\mathbf{\theta} =
\mathbf{M}\,\mathbf{f} + \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{\xi}$. The force $\mathbf{f}$
drives improvement in parameters, $\Delta\mathbf{\theta}$, through the
covariance between the parameters and performance. The metric $\mathbf{M}$
rescales movement by inverse curvature. The bias $\mathbf{b}$ adds momentum or
changes in the frame of reference. The noise $\mathbf{\xi}$ enables
exploration. This framework unifies natural selection, Bayesian updating,
Newton's method, stochastic gradient descent, stochastic Langevin dynamics,
Adam optimization, and most other algorithms as special cases of the same
underlying process. The Price equation also reveals why Fisher information,
Kullback-Leibler divergence, and d'Alembert's principle arise naturally in
learning dynamics. By exposing this common structure, the FMB law provides a
principled foundation for understanding, comparing, and designing learning
algorithms across disciplines.

Result: GPTQ的误差传播步骤获得几何解释，并在无剪裁条件下继承了Babai算法的误差上界。

Conclusion: 研究为GPTQ奠定了理论基础，并启发了未来量化算法的设计。

Abstract: Quantizing the weights of large language models (LLMs) from 16-bit to lower
bitwidth is the de facto approach to deploy massive transformers onto more
affordable accelerators. GPTQ emerged as one of the standard methods for
one-shot post-training quantization at LLM scale. Yet, its inner workings are
described as a sequence of ad-hoc algebraic updates that obscure any geometric
meaning or worst-case guarantees. In this work, we show that, when executed
back-to-front (from the last to first dimension) for a linear layer, GPTQ is
mathematically identical to Babai's nearest plane algorithm for the classical
closest vector problem (CVP) on a lattice defined by the Hessian matrix of the
layer's inputs. This equivalence is based on a sophisticated mathematical
argument, and has two analytical consequences: (i) the GPTQ error propagation
step gains an intuitive geometric interpretation; (ii) GPTQ inherits the error
upper bound of Babai's algorithm under the no-clipping condition. Taken
together, these results place GPTQ on firm theoretical footing and open the
door to importing decades of progress in lattice algorithms towards the design
of future quantization algorithms for billion-parameter models.

Abstract: As AI becomes prevalent in high-risk domains and decision-making, it is
essential to test for potential harms and biases. This urgency is reflected by
the global emergence of AI regulations that emphasise fairness and adequate
testing, with some mandating independent bias audits. However, procuring the
necessary data for fairness testing remains a significant challenge.
Particularly in industry settings, legal and privacy concerns restrict the
collection of demographic data required to assess group disparities, and
auditors face practical and cultural challenges in gaining access to data.
Further, internal historical datasets are often insufficiently representative
to identify real-world biases. This work focuses on evaluating classifier
fairness when complete datasets including demographics are inaccessible. We
propose leveraging separate overlapping datasets to construct complete
synthetic data that includes demographic information and accurately reflects
the underlying relationships between protected attributes and model features.
We validate the fidelity of the synthetic data by comparing it to real data,
and empirically demonstrate that fairness metrics derived from testing on such
synthetic data are consistent with those obtained from real data. This work,
therefore, offers a path to overcome real-world data scarcity for fairness
testing, enabling independent, model-agnostic evaluation of fairness, and

TL;DR: 提出了一种线性内存需求的SE(2)不变注意力机制，用于处理自动驾驶中的空间数据，性能优于非不变架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 处理空间数据在自动驾驶任务中至关重要，现有方法因显式计算所有对象对的相对位姿而需要二次内存。

Method: 设计了SE(2)不变的点积注意力机制，内存需求与对象数量成线性关系。

Result: 实验证明该方法易于实现，且性能优于非不变架构。

Conclusion: SE(2)不变注意力机制在内存效率和性能上均有优势，适用于大规模场景。

Abstract: Processing spatial data is a key component in many learning tasks for
autonomous driving such as motion forecasting, multi-agent simulation, and
planning. Prior works have demonstrated the value in using SE(2) invariant
network architectures that consider only the relative poses between objects
(e.g. other agents, scene features such as traffic lanes). However, these
methods compute the relative poses for all pairs of objects explicitly,
requiring quadratic memory. In this work, we propose a mechanism for SE(2)
invariant scaled dot-product attention that requires linear memory relative to
the number of objects in the scene. Our SE(2) invariant transformer
architecture enjoys the same scaling properties that have benefited large
language models in recent years. We demonstrate experimentally that our
approach is practical to implement and improves performance compared to
comparable non-invariant architectures.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蛋白质的生物学功能由多级结构决定，现有条件扩散模型在可靠生成蛋白质方面仍存在问题。

Method: 提出多级条件扩散模型，整合序列和结构信息，同时生成多级表示，并设计Protein-MMD评估指标。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验证明了生成框架和评估指标的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能高效生成功能性蛋白质，并通过新指标可靠评估生成质量。

Abstract: Generating novel and functional protein sequences is critical to a wide range
of applications in biology. Recent advancements in conditional diffusion models
have shown impressive empirical performance in protein generation tasks.
However, reliable generations of protein remain an open research question in de
novo protein design, especially when it comes to conditional diffusion models.
Considering the biological function of a protein is determined by multi-level
structures, we propose a novel multi-level conditional diffusion model that
integrates both sequence-based and structure-based information for efficient
end-to-end protein design guided by specified functions. By generating
representations at different levels simultaneously, our framework can
effectively model the inherent hierarchical relations between different levels,
resulting in an informative and discriminative representation of the generated
protein. We also propose a Protein-MMD, a new reliable evaluation metric, to
evaluate the quality of generated protein with conditional diffusion models.
Our new metric is able to capture both distributional and functional
similarities between real and generated protein sequences while ensuring
conditional consistency. We experiment with the benchmark datasets, and the
results on conditional protein generation tasks demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed generation framework and evaluation metric.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究缺乏直接量化音色残留的指标，且去除音色信息常导致内容损失。本文旨在解决这些问题，通过可解释性方法优化音色解耦。

Method: 提出了InterpTRQE-SptME基准和InterpTF-SptME方法，分别用于量化音色残留和基于SHAP技术的音色过滤。

Result: 实验显示SHAP Noise方法能将音色残留从18.05%降至近0%，同时保持内容完整性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著优化了音色解耦，提升了内容相关任务性能，并防止音色隐私泄露。

Abstract: Speech pretrained models contain task-specific information across different
layers, but decoupling content and timbre information remains challenging as
removing speaker-specific information often causes content loss. Current
research lacks direct metrics to quantify timbre residual in model encodings,
relying on indirect evaluation through downstream tasks. This paper addresses
these challenges through interpretability-based speaker disentanglement in
speech pretraining models. We quantitatively evaluate timbre residual in model
embeddings and improve speaker disentanglement using interpretive
representations. Our contributions include: (1) InterpTRQE-SptME Benchmark - a
timbre residual recognition framework using interpretability. The benchmark
concatenates content embeddings with timbre embeddings for speaker
classification, then applies Gradient SHAP Explainer to quantify timbre
residual. We evaluate seven speech pretraining model variations. (2)
InterpTF-SptME method - an interpretability-based timbre filtering approach
using SHAP Noise and SHAP Cropping techniques. This model-agnostic method
transforms intermediate encodings to remove timbre while preserving content.
Experiments on VCTK dataset with HuBERT LARGE demonstrate successful content
preservation and significant speaker disentanglement optimization. Results show
the SHAP Noise method can reduce timbre residual from 18.05% to near 0% while
maintaining content integrity, contributing to enhanced performance in
content-related speech processing tasks and preventing timbre privacy leakage.

Result: 模型在音频和视觉领域均表现出对训练数据的记忆，生成与原始内容高度相似的输出。

Conclusion: 揭示了转录条件多模态生成中的关键漏洞，引发对版权、安全和内容来源的担忧。

Abstract: Lyrics-to-Song (LS2) generation models promise end-to-end music synthesis
from text, yet their vulnerability to training data memorization remains
underexplored. We introduce Adversarial PhoneTic Prompting (APT), a novel
attack where lyrics are semantically altered while preserving their acoustic
structure through homophonic substitutions (e.g., Eminem's famous "mom's
spaghetti" $\rightarrow$ "Bob's confetti"). Despite these distortions, we
uncover a powerful form of sub-lexical memorization: models like SUNO and YuE
regenerate outputs strikingly similar to known training content, achieving high
similarity across audio-domain metrics, including CLAP, AudioJudge, and
CoverID. This vulnerability persists across multiple languages and genres. More
surprisingly, we discover that phoneme-altered lyrics alone can trigger visual
memorization in text-to-video models. When prompted with phonetically modified
lyrics from Lose Yourself, Veo 3 reconstructs visual elements from the original
music video -- including character appearance and scene composition -- despite
no visual cues in the prompt. We term this phenomenon phonetic-to-visual
regurgitation. Together, these findings expose a critical vulnerability in
transcript-conditioned multimodal generation: phonetic prompting alone can
unlock memorized audiovisual content, raising urgent questions about copyright,
safety, and content provenance in modern generative systems. Example
generations are available on our demo page (jrohsc.github.io/music_attack/).

Abstract: Recent advances in Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable
capabilities across textual and multimodal domains. In parallel,
diffusion-based language models have emerged as a promising alternative to the
autoregressive paradigm, offering improved controllability, bidirectional
context modeling, and robust generation. However, their application to the
audio modality remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce
\textbf{DIFFA}, the first diffusion-based Large Audio-Language Model designed
to perform spoken language understanding. DIFFA integrates a frozen diffusion
language model with a lightweight dual-adapter architecture that bridges speech
understanding and natural language reasoning. We employ a two-stage training
pipeline: first, aligning semantic representations via an ASR objective; then,
learning instruction-following abilities through synthetic audio-caption pairs
automatically generated by prompting LLMs. Despite being trained on only 960
hours of ASR and 127 hours of synthetic instruction data, DIFFA demonstrates
competitive performance on major benchmarks, including MMSU, MMAU, and
VoiceBench, outperforming several autoregressive open-source baselines. Our
results reveal the potential of diffusion-based language models for efficient
and scalable audio understanding, opening a new direction for speech-driven AI.

Abstract: Designing a Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme that enables a mobile robot
to safely navigate through an obstacle-filled environment is a complicated yet
essential task in robotics. In this technical report, safety refers to ensuring
that the robot respects state and input constraints while avoiding collisions
with obstacles despite the presence of disturbances and measurement noise. This
report offers a step-by-step approach to implementing Nonlinear Model
Predictive Control (NMPC) schemes addressing these safety requirements.
Numerous books and survey papers provide comprehensive overviews of linear MPC
(LMPC) \cite{bemporad2007robust,kouvaritakis2016model}, NMPC
\cite{rawlings2017model,allgower2004nonlinear,mayne2014model,grune2017nonlinear,saltik2018outlook},
and their applications in various domains, including robotics
\cite{nascimento2018nonholonomic,nguyen2021model,shi2021advanced,wei2022mpc}.
This report does not aim to replicate those exhaustive reviews. Instead, it
focuses specifically on NMPC as a foundation for safe mobile robot navigation.
The goal is to provide a practical and accessible path from theoretical
concepts to mathematical proofs and implementation, emphasizing safety and
performance guarantees. It is intended for researchers, robotics engineers, and
practitioners seeking to bridge the gap between theoretical NMPC formulations
and real-world robotic applications.

Conclusion: MLLMs能够有效提升机器人对复杂语言指令的理解和执行能力，适用于开放世界的导航任务。

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong
common-sense reasoning abilities, making them promising for robotic navigation
and planning tasks. However, despite recent progress, bridging the gap between
language descriptions and actual robot actions in the open-world, beyond merely
invoking limited predefined motion primitives, remains an open challenge. In
this work, we aim to enable robots to interpret and decompose complex language
instructions, ultimately synthesizing a sequence of trajectory points to
complete diverse navigation tasks given open-set instructions and open-set
objects. We observe that multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit
strong cross-modal understanding when processing free-form language
instructions, demonstrating robust scene comprehension. More importantly,
leveraging their code-generation capability, MLLMs can interact with
vision-language perception models to generate compositional 2D bird-eye-view
value maps, effectively integrating semantic knowledge from MLLMs with spatial
information from maps to reinforce the robot's spatial understanding. To
further validate our approach, we effectively leverage large-scale autonomous
vehicle datasets (AVDs) to validate our proposed zero-shot vision-language
navigation framework in outdoor navigation tasks, demonstrating its capability
to execute a diverse range of free-form natural language navigation
instructions while maintaining robustness against object detection errors and
linguistic ambiguities. Furthermore, we validate our system on a Husky robot in
both indoor and outdoor scenes, demonstrating its real-world robustness and
applicability. Supplementary videos are available at

Conclusion: 模块化方法在多子系统状态估计中有效避免了信息重复计算，并在通信受限情况下保持了良好的性能。

Abstract: In this paper we propose a modular nonlinear least squares filtering approach
for systems composed of independent subsystems. The state and error covariance
estimate of each subsystem is updated independently, even when a relative
measurement simultaneously depends on the states of multiple subsystems. We
integrate the Covariance Intersection (CI) algorithm as part of our solution in
order to prevent double counting of information when subsystems share estimates
with each other. An alternative derivation of the CI algorithm based on least
squares estimation makes this integration possible. We particularise the
proposed approach to the robot-landmark localization problem. In this problem,
noisy measurements of the bearing angle to a stationary landmark position
measured relative to the SE(2) pose of a moving robot couple the estimation
problems for the robot pose and the landmark position. In a randomized
simulation study, we benchmark the proposed modular method against a monolithic
joint state filter to elucidate their respective trade-offs. In this study we
also include variants of the proposed method that achieve a graceful
degradation of performance with reduced communication and bandwidth
requirements.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach that combines the advantages of both
model-based and learning-based frameworks to achieve robust locomotion. The
residual modules are integrated with each corresponding part of the model-based
framework, a footstep planner and dynamic model designed using heuristics, to
complement performance degradation caused by a model mismatch. By utilizing a
modular structure and selecting the appropriate learning-based method for each
residual module, our framework demonstrates improved control performance in
environments with high uncertainty, while also achieving higher learning
efficiency compared to baseline methods. Moreover, we observed that our
proposed methodology not only enhances control performance but also provides
additional benefits, such as making nominal controllers more robust to
parameter tuning. To investigate the feasibility of our framework, we
demonstrated residual modules combined with model predictive control in a real
quadrupedal robot. Despite uncertainties beyond the simulation, the robot
successfully maintains balance and tracks the commanded velocity.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a subsystem, using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV),
for search and rescue missions, focusing on people detection, face recognition
and tracking of identified individuals. The proposed solution integrates a UAV
with ROS2 framework, that utilizes multiple convolutional neural networks (CNN)
for search missions. System identification and PD controller deployment are
performed for autonomous UAV navigation. The ROS2 environment utilizes the
YOLOv11 and YOLOv11-pose CNNs for tracking purposes, and the dlib library CNN
for face recognition. The system detects a specific individual, performs face
recognition and starts tracking. If the individual is not yet known, the UAV
operator can manually locate the person, save their facial image and
immediately initiate the tracking process. The tracking process relies on
specific keypoints identified on the human body using the YOLOv11-pose CNN
model. These keypoints are used to track a specific individual and maintain a
safe distance. To enhance accurate tracking, system identification is
performed, based on measurement data from the UAVs IMU. The identified system
parameters are used to design PD controllers that utilize YOLOv11-pose to
estimate the distance between the UAVs camera and the identified individual.
The initial experiments, conducted on 14 known individuals, demonstrated that
the proposed subsystem can be successfully used in real time. The next step
involves implementing the system on a large experimental UAV for field use and
integrating autonomous navigation with GPS-guided control for rescue operations
planning.

Conclusion: MoRPI-PINN是一种轻量级、适用于边缘设备的导航解决方案。

Abstract: A fundamental requirement for full autonomy in mobile robots is accurate
navigation even in situations where satellite navigation or cameras are
unavailable. In such practical situations, relying only on inertial sensors
will result in navigation solution drift due to the sensors' inherent noise and
error terms. One of the emerging solutions to mitigate drift is to maneuver the
robot in a snake-like slithering motion to increase the inertial
signal-to-noise ratio, allowing the regression of the mobile robot position. In
this work, we propose MoRPI-PINN as a physics-informed neural network framework
for accurate inertial-based mobile robot navigation. By embedding physical laws
and constraints into the training process, MoRPI-PINN is capable of providing
an accurate and robust navigation solution. Using real-world experiments, we
show accuracy improvements of over 85% compared to other approaches. MoRPI-PINN
is a lightweight approach that can be implemented even on edge devices and used
in any typical mobile robot application.

Conclusion: MediaPipe算法有潜力整合到医疗程序中，但需进一步优化精度。

Abstract: The use of robotics, computer vision, and their applications is becoming
increasingly widespread in various fields, including medicine. Many face
detection algorithms have found applications in neurosurgery, ophthalmology,
and plastic surgery. A common challenge in using these algorithms is variable
lighting conditions and the flexibility of detection positions to identify and
precisely localize patients. The proposed experiment tests the MediaPipe
algorithm for detecting facial landmarks in a controlled setting, using a
robotic arm that automatically adjusts positions while the surgical light and
the phantom remain in a fixed position. The results of this study demonstrate
that the improved accuracy of facial landmark detection under surgical lighting
significantly enhances the detection performance at larger yaw and pitch
angles. The increase in standard deviation/dispersion occurs due to imprecise
detection of selected facial landmarks. This analysis allows for a discussion
on the potential integration of the MediaPipe algorithm into medical
procedures.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ReSem3D是一个统一的机器人操作框架，通过结合视觉基础模型和多模态大语言模型，实现细粒度语义约束和实时闭环规划，解决了现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在语义约束建模、实时规划和环境鲁棒性方面存在不足，ReSem3D旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 利用MLLMs和VFMs的协同作用，通过分层递归推理构建3D空间约束，并将其编码为实时优化目标。

Result: 在仿真和真实环境中验证了ReSem3D的零样本适应性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: ReSem3D在语义多样的环境中表现出色，适用于多样化操作任务。

Abstract: Semantics-driven 3D spatial constraints align highlevel semantic
representations with low-level action spaces, facilitating the unification of
task understanding and execution in robotic manipulation. The synergistic
reasoning of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Vision Foundation
Models (VFMs) enables cross-modal 3D spatial constraint construction.
Nevertheless, existing methods have three key limitations: (1) coarse semantic
granularity in constraint modeling, (2) lack of real-time closed-loop planning,
(3) compromised robustness in semantically diverse environments. To address
these challenges, we propose ReSem3D, a unified manipulation framework for
semantically diverse environments, leveraging the synergy between VFMs and
MLLMs to achieve fine-grained visual grounding and dynamically constructs
hierarchical 3D spatial constraints for real-time manipulation. Specifically,
the framework is driven by hierarchical recursive reasoning in MLLMs, which
interact with VFMs to automatically construct 3D spatial constraints from
natural language instructions and RGB-D observations in two stages: part-level
extraction and region-level refinement. Subsequently, these constraints are
encoded as real-time optimization objectives in joint space, enabling reactive
behavior to dynamic disturbances. Extensive simulation and real-world
experiments are conducted in semantically rich household and sparse chemical
lab environments. The results demonstrate that ReSem3D performs diverse
manipulation tasks under zero-shot conditions, exhibiting strong adaptability
and generalization. Code and videos at https://resem3d.github.io.

Method: 利用基础模型提取物体局部几何特征，构建部分级功能标注数据集，并推理复杂机制生成控制代码。

Result: 仿真和真实实验表明AdaRPG在新型铰接物体类别上具有强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: AdaRPG通过局部几何特征和基础模型知识，有效提升了机器人对铰接物体的适应性操作能力。

Abstract: Articulated objects pose diverse manipulation challenges for robots. Since
their internal structures are not directly observable, robots must adaptively
explore and refine actions to generate successful manipulation trajectories.
While existing works have attempted cross-category generalization in adaptive
articulated object manipulation, two major challenges persist: (1) the
geometric diversity of real-world articulated objects complicates visual
perception and understanding, and (2) variations in object functions and
mechanisms hinder the development of a unified adaptive manipulation strategy.
To address these challenges, we propose AdaRPG, a novel framework that
leverages foundation models to extract object parts, which exhibit greater
local geometric similarity than entire objects, thereby enhancing visual
affordance generalization for functional primitive skills. To support this, we
construct a part-level affordance annotation dataset to train the affordance
model. Additionally, AdaRPG utilizes the common knowledge embedded in
foundation models to reason about complex mechanisms and generate high-level
control codes that invoke primitive skill functions based on part affordance
inference. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate AdaRPG's strong
generalization ability across novel articulated object categories.

Motivation: 解决单传感器系统（如LiDAR或GPS）在烟雾、隧道和恶劣天气等复杂动态环境中性能下降的问题。

Result: 在数据集和真实机器人环境中验证，表现优于现有方法，尤其在烟雾和隧道等挑战性条件下。

Conclusion: AF-RLIO通过多传感器融合显著提升了复杂环境中的里程计估计鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: In robotic navigation, maintaining precise pose estimation and navigation in
complex and dynamic environments is crucial. However, environmental challenges
such as smoke, tunnels, and adverse weather can significantly degrade the
performance of single-sensor systems like LiDAR or GPS, compromising the
overall stability and safety of autonomous robots. To address these challenges,
we propose AF-RLIO: an adaptive fusion approach that integrates 4D
millimeter-wave radar, LiDAR, inertial measurement unit (IMU), and GPS to
leverage the complementary strengths of these sensors for robust odometry
estimation in complex environments. Our method consists of three key modules.
Firstly, the pre-processing module utilizes radar data to assist LiDAR in
removing dynamic points and determining when environmental conditions are
degraded for LiDAR. Secondly, the dynamic-aware multimodal odometry selects
appropriate point cloud data for scan-to-map matching and tightly couples it
with the IMU using the Iterative Error State Kalman Filter. Lastly, the factor
graph optimization module balances weights between odometry and GPS data,
constructing a pose graph for optimization. The proposed approach has been
evaluated on datasets and tested in real-world robotic environments,
demonstrating its effectiveness and advantages over existing methods in
challenging conditions such as smoke and tunnels.

Conclusion: G2S-ICP SLAM通过几何感知的高斯表示和优化框架，实现了实时高保真3D重建和相机跟踪。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel geometry-aware RGB-D Gaussian Splatting
SLAM system, named G2S-ICP SLAM. The proposed method performs high-fidelity 3D
reconstruction and robust camera pose tracking in real-time by representing
each scene element using a Gaussian distribution constrained to the local
tangent plane. This effectively models the local surface as a 2D Gaussian disk
aligned with the underlying geometry, leading to more consistent depth
interpretation across multiple viewpoints compared to conventional 3D
ellipsoid-based representations with isotropic uncertainty. To integrate this
representation into the SLAM pipeline, we embed the surface-aligned Gaussian
disks into a Generalized ICP framework by introducing anisotropic covariance
prior without altering the underlying registration formulation. Furthermore we
propose a geometry-aware loss that supervises photometric, depth, and normal
consistency. Our system achieves real-time operation while preserving both
visual and geometric fidelity. Extensive experiments on the Replica and
TUM-RGBD datasets demonstrate that G2S-ICP SLAM outperforms prior SLAM systems
in terms of localization accuracy, reconstruction completeness, while
maintaining the rendering quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的Pure Pursuit控制和MPC方法在车辆轨迹跟踪中存在建模精度与计算效率的权衡问题，影响控制性能。

Method: 采用双线性MPC架构：LMPC基于车辆运动学模型计算基础控制输入，神经网络RKMPC计算补偿输入，两者叠加得到最终控制指令。

Result: 实验表明，RKMPC仅需传统KMPC 20%的训练数据，横向误差减少11.7%-22.1%，航向误差减少8.9%-15.8%，前轮转向稳定性提升27.6%。

Conclusion: RKMPC在保持传统模型可靠性的同时，通过残差建模优化性能，适用于车辆轨迹跟踪任务。

Abstract: In vehicle trajectory tracking tasks, the simplest approach is the Pure
Pursuit (PP) Control. However, this single-point preview tracking strategy
fails to consider vehicle model constraints, compromising driving safety. Model
Predictive Control (MPC) as a widely adopted control method, optimizes control
actions by incorporating mechanistic models and physical constraints. While its
control performance critically depends on the accuracy of vehicle modeling.
Traditional vehicle modeling approaches face inherent trade-offs between
capturing nonlinear dynamics and maintaining computational efficiency, often
resulting in reduced control performance. To address these challenges, this
paper proposes Residual Koopman Model Predictive Control (RKMPC) framework.
This method uses two linear MPC architecture to calculate control inputs: a
Linear Model Predictive Control (LMPC) computes the baseline control input
based on the vehicle kinematic model, and a neural network-based RKMPC
calculates the compensation input. The final control command is obtained by
adding these two components. This design preserves the reliability and
interpretability of traditional mechanistic model while achieving performance
optimization through residual modeling. This method has been validated on the
Carsim-Matlab joint simulation platform and a physical 1:10 scale F1TENTH
racing car. Experimental results show that RKMPC requires only 20% of the
training data needed by traditional Koopman Model Predictive Control (KMPC)
while delivering superior tracking performance. Compared to traditional LMPC,
RKMPC reduces lateral error by 11.7%-22.1%, decreases heading error by
8.9%-15.8%, and improves front-wheel steering stability by up to 27.6%. The
implementation code is available at: https://github.com/ZJU-DDRX/Residual

Abstract: Robotic-assisted dressing has the potential to significantly aid both
patients as well as healthcare personnel, reducing the workload and improving
the efficiency in clinical settings. While substantial progress has been made
in robotic dressing assistance, prior works typically assume that garments are
already unfolded and ready for use. However, in medical applications gowns and
aprons are often stored in a folded configuration, requiring an additional
unfolding step. In this paper, we introduce the pre-dressing step, the process
of unfolding garments prior to assisted dressing. We leverage imitation
learning for learning three manipulation primitives, including both high and
low acceleration motions. In addition, we employ a visual classifier to
categorise the garment state as closed, partly opened, and fully opened. We
conduct an empirical evaluation of the learned manipulation primitives as well
as their combinations. Our results show that highly dynamic motions are not
effective for unfolding freshly unpacked garments, where the combination of
motions can efficiently enhance the opening configuration.

Abstract: In recent years, Compressed Sensing (CS) has gained significant interest as a
technique for acquiring high-resolution sensory data using fewer measurements
than traditional Nyquist sampling requires. At the same time, autonomous
robotic platforms such as drones and rovers have become increasingly popular
tools for remote sensing and environmental monitoring tasks, including
measurements of temperature, humidity, and air quality. Within this context,
this paper presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first investigation into
how the structure of CS measurement matrices can be exploited to design
optimized sampling trajectories for robotic environmental data collection. We
propose a novel Monte Carlo optimization framework that generates measurement
matrices designed to minimize both the robot's traversal path length and the
signal reconstruction error within the CS framework. Central to our approach is
the application of Dictionary Learning (DL) to obtain a data-driven sparsifying
transform, which enhances reconstruction accuracy while further reducing the
number of samples that the robot needs to collect. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method through experiments reconstructing $NO_2$ pollution
maps over the Gulf region. The results indicate that our approach can reduce
robot travel distance to less than $10\%$ of a full-coverage path, while
improving reconstruction accuracy by over a factor of five compared to
traditional CS methods based on DCT and polynomial dictionaries, as well as by
a factor of two compared to previously-proposed Informative Path Planning (IPP)
methods.

Abstract: This paper studies the experimental comparison of two different whole-body
control formulations for humanoid robots: inverse dynamics whole-body control
(ID-WBC) and passivity-based whole-body control (PB-WBC). The two controllers
fundamentally differ from each other as the first is formulated in task
acceleration space and the latter is in task force space with passivity
considerations. Even though both control methods predict stability under ideal
conditions in closed-loop dynamics, their robustness against joint friction,
sensor noise, unmodeled external disturbances, and non-perfect contact
conditions is not evident. Therefore, we analyze and experimentally compare the
two controllers on a humanoid robot platform through swing foot position and
orientation control, squatting with and without unmodeled additional weights,
and jumping. We also relate the observed performance and characteristic
differences with the controller formulations and highlight each controller's
advantages and disadvantages.

Abstract: Multi-agent collaboration enhances situational awareness in intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions. Ad hoc networks of unmanned

their provided information in a decentralized fashion. Trust-informed data
fusion prioritizes fusing data from reliable sources, enhancing resilience and

Conclusion: RMA有效减轻建模负担，加速决策过程，适用于工业系统设计。

Abstract: Designing industrial systems, such as building, improving, and automating
distribution centers and manufacturing plants, involves critical
decision-making with limited information in the early phases. The lack of
information leads to less accurate designs of the systems, which are often
difficult to resolve later. It is effective to use simulators to model the
designed system and find out the issues early. However, the modeling time
required by conventional simulators is too long to allow for rapid model
creation to meet decision-making demands. In this paper, we propose a Rapid
Modeling Architecture (RMA) for a lightweight industrial simulator that
mitigates the modeling burden while maintaining the essential details in order
to accelerate and improve decision-making. We have prototyped a simulator based
on the RMA and applied it to the actual factory layout design problem. We also
compared the modeling time of our simulator to that of an existing simulator,
and as a result, our simulator achieved a 78.3% reduction in modeling time
compared to conventional simulators.

Abstract: Small-signal stability issues-induced broadband oscillations pose significant
threats to the secure operation of multi-inverter systems, attracting extensive
research attention. Researches revealed that system instability is led by the
lacking of positive damping, yet it has not been clearly specified how much the
exact amount of damping compensation required to sufficiently ensure system
global stability. This paper presents a feasible solution for quantitative
damping calculation and compensation to enhance the global stability of
inverter-based systems. First, based on the system nodal admittance model, a
quantitative damping calculation algorithm is presented, which can suggest the
required damping compensation as well as compensation location for sufficient
stability improvement. Then, we propose a specific AD with output current
feedforward control strategy, which make the AD be quasi-pure resistive and can
effectively enhance system damping efficiency. Finally, a testing system with
three inverters is used as case study, showing that the proposed method
provides a promising solution to efficiently enhance the global stability
improvement of inverter-based systems. Simulations and experiments validate the
proposed method.

Abstract: Power systems decarbonization are at the focal point of the clean energy
transition. While system operators and utility companies increasingly publicize
system-level carbon emission information, it remains unclear how emissions from
individual generators are transported through the grid and how they impact
electricity users at specific locations. This paper presents a novel and
computationally efficient approach for exact quantification of nodal average
and marginal carbon emission rates, applicable to both AC and DC optimal power
flow problems. The approach leverages graph-based topological sorting and
directed cycle removal techniques, applied to directed graphs formed by
generation dispatch and optimal power flow solutions. Our proposed algorithm
efficiently identifies each generator's contribution to each node, capturing
how emissions are spatially distributed under varying system conditions. To
validate its effectiveness and reveal locational and temporal emission patterns
in the real world, we simulate the 8,870-bus realistic California grid using
actual CAISO data and the CATS model. Based on year long hourly data on nodal
loads and renewable generation, obtained or estimated from CAISO public data,
our method accurately estimates power flow conditions, generation mixes, and
systemwide emissions, and delivers fine grained spatiotemporal emission
analysis for every California county. Both our algorithm and the California
study are open-sourced, providing a foundation for future research on grid
emissions, planning, operations, and energy policy.

Conclusion: 所提出的去中心化方法在通信基础设施受损时仍能有效提升微电网的韧性。

Abstract: Mobile power sources (MPSs) have been gradually deployed in microgrids as
critical resources to coordinate with repair crews (RCs) towards resilience
enhancement owing to their flexibility and mobility in handling the complex
coupled power-transport systems. However, previous work solves the coordinated
dispatch problem of MPSs and RCs in a centralized manner with the assumption
that the communication network is still fully functioning after the event.
However, there is growing evidence that certain extreme events will damage or
degrade communication infrastructure, which makes centralized decision making
impractical. To fill this gap, this paper formulates the resilience-driven
dispatch problem of MPSs and RCs in a decentralized framework. To solve this
problem, a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning method featuring a
two-level framework is proposed, where the high-level action is used to switch
decision-making between power and transport networks, and the low-level action
constructed via a hybrid policy is used to compute continuous scheduling and
discrete routing decisions in power and transport networks, respectively. The
proposed method also uses an embedded function encapsulating system dynamics to
enhance learning stability and scalability. Case studies based on IEEE 33-bus
and 69-bus power networks are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the
proposed method in load restoration.

frequency-constrained models for power system security. However, most existing
literature only considers uniform frequency security, while neglecting
frequency spatial differences in different regions. To fill this gap, this
paper proposes a novel planning model for the optimal sizing problem of power
systems, capturing regional frequency security and inter-area frequency
oscillations. Specifically, regional frequency constraints are first extracted
via an enhanced input convex neural network (ICNN) and then embedded into the
original optimisation for frequency security, where a principled weight
initialisation strategy is adopted to deal with the gradient vanishing issues
of non-negative weights in traditional ICNNs and enhance its fitting ability.
An adaptive genetic algorithm with sparsity calculation and local search is
developed to separate the planning model into two stages and effectively solve
it iteratively. Case studies have been conducted on three different power
systems to verify the effectiveness of the proposed frequency-constrained
planning model in ensuring regional system security and obtaining realistic
investment decisions.

### [212] [Two-Stage TSO-DSO Services Provision Framework for Electric Vehicle Coordination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18110)
*Yi Wang,Dawei Qiu,Fei Teng,Goran Strbac*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种两阶段框架，协调电动汽车（EVs）为输电系统运营商（TSOs）提供频率服务，同时为配电系统运营商（DSOs）提供电压支持。通过分散式操作和高效通信的强化学习算法，解决了大规模EVs的实时调度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高比例可再生能源导致电力系统惯性降低，频率响应需求增加。EVs通过V2G能力可为TSOs提供经济高效的频率服务，但可能对DSOs的电压安全造成影响。

Method: 提出两阶段服务框架：第一阶段为TSO-DSO日前交互，规划频率储备；第二阶段为实时调度，支持DSO电压。采用分散式操作和高效通信的强化学习算法。

Result: 在6节点输电和33/69节点配电网络上的案例研究表明，该方法能有效协调EVs的频率服务和电压支持，且具有可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了EVs在频率服务和电压支持中的协调问题，并通过分散式强化学习算法实现了高效的大规模调度。

Abstract: High renewable penetration has been witnessed in power systems, resulting in
reduced system inertia and increasing requirements for frequency response
services. Electric vehicles (EVs), owing to their vehicle-to-grid (V2G)
capabilities, can provide cost-effective frequency services for transmission
system operators (TSOs). However, EVs that are inherently connected to
distribution networks may pose voltage security issues for distribution system
operators (DSOs) when supporting TSO frequency. To coordinate both TSO
frequency and DSO voltage, this paper proposes a two-stage service provision
framework for multi-EVs. At stage one, EVs participate in day-ahead TSO-DSO
interactions for frequency reserve schedules; at stage two, EVs make real-time
dispatching behaviors in distribution networks for reserve delivery while
supporting DSO voltage. Considering the potentially large EV number and
environment complexity, a decentralized operation paradigm is introduced for
real-time EV dispatches at stage two, while a communication-efficient
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed to reduce the communication
overhead during large-scale multi-agent RL training without compromising policy
performance. Case studies are carried out on a 6-bus transmission and 33-bus
distribution network as well as a 69-bus distribution network to evaluate the
effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method in enabling EVs for
frequency service and voltage support.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于数据驱动的降阶模型（ROM）构建框架，适用于未知数学模型的非线性动态系统，并通过仿真函数和半定规划保证模型准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维动态系统的降阶模型在控制器设计中至关重要，但非线性项和未知系统模型增加了构建难度。

Method: 利用两组输入-状态轨迹数据构建系统闭环表示，通过仿真函数和半定规划同时构造ROM和SF。

Result: 数据驱动的ROM可用于控制器设计，并通过接口函数将结果映射回原系统，验证了在非线性动态系统中的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架为未知非线性系统提供了有效的降阶模型构建方法，并展示了在控制器设计中的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Model order reduction simplifies high-dimensional dynamical systems by
deriving lower-dimensional models that preserve essential system
characteristics. These techniques are crucial to controller design for complex
systems while significantly reducing computational costs. Nevertheless,
constructing effective reduced-order models (ROMs) poses considerable
challenges, particularly for dynamical systems characterized by highly
nonlinear terms. These challenges are further exacerbated when the actual
system model is unavailable, a scenario frequently encountered in real-world
applications. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework for the
construction of ROMs for both continuous- and discrete-time nonlinear dynamical
systems with unknown mathematical models. By leveraging two sets of data
collected from the system, referred to as two input-state trajectories, we
first construct a data-based closed-loop representation of the system. We then
establish a similarity relation between the output trajectories of the original
system and those of its data-driven ROM employing the notion of simulation
functions (SFs), thereby enabling a formal characterization of their closeness.
To achieve this, we propose data-dependent semidefinite programs as sufficient
conditions to simultaneously construct both ROMs and SFs, while offering
correctness guarantees. We demonstrate that the obtained data-driven ROMs can
be employed for synthesizing controllers that ensure the unknown system
satisfies high-level logic properties. This is accomplished by first designing
controllers for the data-driven ROMs and then translating the results back to
the original system through an interface function. We evaluate the efficacy of
our data-driven findings through four benchmark case studies involving unknown
dynamics with highly nonlinear terms.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理大规模子系统时样本复杂度呈指数增长，不适用于实际应用，因此需要一种更高效的数据驱动方法。

Method: 通过重构delta-ISS Lyapunov条件为鲁棒优化程序（ROP），再转化为场景优化程序（SOP），利用子系统轨迹数据构建delta-ISS Lyapunov函数，并通过小增益组合条件验证互联网络的稳定性。

Conclusion: 该数据驱动组合方法在大规模网络中具有高效性和实用性，为未知动态网络的稳定性验证提供了新思路。

Abstract: This work focuses on a compositional data-driven approach to verify
incremental global asymptotic stability (delta-GAS) over interconnected
homogeneous networks of degree one with unknown mathematical dynamics. Our
proposed approach leverages the concept of incremental input-to-state stability
(delta-ISS) of subsystems, characterized by delta-ISS Lyapunov functions. To
implement our data-driven scheme, we initially reframe the delta-ISS Lyapunov
conditions as a robust optimization program (ROP). However, due to the presence
of unknown subsystem dynamics in the ROP constraints, we develop a scenario
optimization program (SOP) by gathering data from trajectories of each unknown
subsystem. We solve the SOP and construct a delta-ISS Lyapunov function for
each subsystem with unknown dynamics. We then leverage a small-gain
compositional condition to facilitate the construction of an incremental
Lyapunov function for an unknown interconnected network with unknown dynamics
based on its data-driven delta-ISS Lyapunov functions of individual subsystems,
while providing correctness guarantees. We demonstrate that our data-driven
compositional approach aligns sample complexity with subsystem granularity,
resulting in a linear increase in required data as the number of subsystems
rises. In contrast, the existing monolithic approach in the literature exhibits
exponential growth in sample complexity with increasing number of subsystems,
rendering it impractical for real-world applications. To validate the
effectiveness of our compositional data-driven approach, we apply it to an
unknown nonlinear homogeneous network of degree one, comprising 10000
subsystems. By gathering data from each unknown subsystem, we demonstrate that
the interconnected network is delta-GAS with a correctness guarantee.

Conclusion: 燃料循环感知的灵活性建模对核反应堆的准确调度至关重要，并为核能集成到能源系统模型提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Nuclear reactors are often modeled as inflexible, baseload generators with
fixed downtimes and restrictive ramping limits. In practice, however, a
reactor's operational flexibility is closely tied to it's fuel cycle stage and
the associated reactivity margin. A key physical constraint to power
maneuverability is xenon poisoning, caused by an increase in neutron absorbing
xenon concentration following a power ramp down. This can delay or even prevent
subsequent power ramp up due to suppressed core reactivity. Additionally, if a
reactor is shutdown during periods of low reactivity, restart times can vary
significantly due to these xenon transients, leading to longer downtimes. This
work introduces a physics informed, metaheuristic modeling approach that embeds
fuel cycle dynamics directly with a unit commitment (UC) framework. The
framework tracks reactivity margin, dynamically activates xenon related
constraints, and endogenously implements refueling outages based on the core
conditions. By capturing intra-cycle reactivity evolution and the conditional
onset of xenon poisoning, the formulation allows for operation dependent
nuclear dispatch that reflects both regulatory limits and physical behavior.
When applied to a representative reactor fleet operating in distinct modes of
operation -- ranging from baseload to part load -- the framework reveals that
flexible operation can slow reactivity degradation and extend fuel cycles. The
results show that fuel cycle aware flexibility modeling is critical for
accurate scheduling of nuclear reactors and offers a tractable pathway to
integrate nuclear power in energy system models.

Conclusion: 该框架扩展了控制器设计范围，减少了保守性约束，并通过通信提升了性能。

Abstract: We consider the problem of designing learning-based reactive power
controllers that perform voltage regulation in distribution grids while
ensuring closed-loop system stability. In contrast to existing methods, where
the provably stable controllers are restricted to be decentralized, we propose
a unified design framework that enables the controllers to take advantage of an
arbitrary communication infrastructure on top of the physical power network.
This allows the controllers to incorporate information beyond their local bus,
covering existing methods as a special case and leading to less conservative
constraints on the controller design. We then provide a design procedure to
construct input convex neural network (ICNN) based controllers that satisfy the
identified stability constraints by design under arbitrary communication
scenarios, and train these controllers using supervised learning. Simulation
results on the the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) microgrid testbed
illustrate the effectiveness of the framework and highlight the role of
communication in improving control performance.

Method: 开发MILP模型，结合温度离散化和动态特性，进行多情景分析，考虑碳税和CO2排放。

Result: 模型收敛性提升，太阳能集成达11,932 m²，但增加天然气依赖和TES损失；生物质锅炉降低太阳能依赖但限制可再生渗透。

Conclusion: 高碳税促进太阳能采用但存储效率低，生物质提升成本效益和系统稳定性。

Abstract: The integration of renewable sources is essential for decarbonizing heat
production in district energy networks. Beyond biomass-based solutions, solar
thermal energy, with or without heat pumps, presents a significant opportunity.
However, system performance is highly dependent on outdoor and setpoint
temperatures. This study aims to optimize system design using a multi-criteria
approach that considers techno-economic and environmental (CO2) factors. A
Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model is developed, incorporating
temperature discretization for problem linearization and capturing key dynamic
characteristics of heat generators. The model improves convergence, reducing a
19% MIP gap in 26 hours to 10% in 12 hours by dissipating 6% excess solar heat.
A multi-scenario analysis under two carbon taxation levels and different CO2
emission cases revealed solar integration up to 11,932 m${}^2$ but increased
gas reliance (50%) and TES losses (49%). Wood boiler inclusion reduced solar
dependency, covering 45% of heat, lowered LCOH, but limited renewable
penetration. Higher carbon taxes boosted solar adoption but faced storage
inefficiencies, while biomass enhanced cost efficiency and system stability.

Motivation: 垂直农业因其能提供稳定、高质量、无虫害的蔬菜生产，并与能源系统和城市发展协同，受到关注。标准化设计和操作指南对提高能效和降低成本至关重要。

Method: 研究分析了垂直农业系统的生产性能和能耗，评估其效率、可持续性和经济性。通过162种情景（温度、PPFD、CO2浓度、气候区和绝缘厚度组合）进行评估。

Result: PPFD是作物生长（相关性0.85）和能耗（相关性0.73）的主要因素。最佳经济性配置为24C、250 PPFD、1400 ppm CO2。

Conclusion: 只有接近脱碳的能源系统才能在不增加CO2排放的情况下支持垂直农业。

Abstract: The increasing interest in vertical farming arises from its ability to ensure
consistent, high-quality, and pest-free vegetable production while supporting
synergies with energy systems and urban development. Accordingly, standardized
design and operation guidelines are essential to improve energy efficiency and
lower costs. This study analyzes the production performance and energy
consumption of a vertical farming system, assessing its efficiency,
sustainability, and economic viability. A total of 162 scenarios were evaluated
by combining three levels of temperature, photosynthetic photon flux density
(PPFD), and CO2 concentration across three distinct climatic zones, namely
Norway, China, and Dubai, which also differ from a socio-environmental
viewpoint. Two insulation thicknesses were also tested in each scenario.
Results indicate that due to the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning and
dehumidification (HVACD) system, neither the insulation layer nor the external
climate significantly influences crop productivity. PPFD proved to be the
dominant factor in crop growth (correlation: 0.85), followed by CO2 (0.36) and
indoor temperature (0.22). PPFD also emerged as the primary driver of overall
energy consumption (correlation: 0.73), as it affects both lighting and HVACD
loads. Notably, the lowest specific energy consumption (SEC) coincided with the
lowest crop productivity (55 kg/m2). The levelized cost of lettuce (LCoL),
balancing productivity and energy use, identified the most cost-effective setup
as 24C, 250 PPFD, 1400 ppm CO2, with insulation, consistent across all
climates. Ultimately, only nearly decarbonized energy systems can support
vertical farming without increasing CO2 emissions compared to imported lettuce.

Abstract: Water utilities aim to reduce the high electrical costs of Water Distribution
Networks (WDNs), primarily driven by pumping. However, pump scheduling is
challenging due to model uncertainties and water demand forecast errors. This
paper presents a Robust Model Predictive Control (RMPC) method for optimal and
reliable pump scheduling, extending a previous efficient robust control method
tailored to our model. A linear model with bounded additive disturbances is
used to represent tank water level evolution, with uncertainty bounds derived
from WDN simulation and demand data. At each time step, a pump scheduling
policy, affine in past disturbances, is optimized to satisfy system constraints
over a prediction horizon. The resulting policies are then applied in a
receding horizon fashion. The optimization problem is formulated to require
$\mathcal{O}(N^6)$ computations per iteration with an interior-point method,
which is reduced to $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ by reformulating it into a sparse form.
When evaluated on a model representing the water distribution network of
Randers, a medium-sized town in Denmark, the method surpasses nominal and
constraint-tightening model predictive control (MPC) approaches in terms of
meeting constraints and provides comparable economic outcomes.

Conclusion: 提出的框架成功应用于两帧系统的GES观测器设计，并通过非平凡示例验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Linear observed systems on groups encode the geometry of a variety of
practical state estimation problems. In this paper, we propose a unified
observer framework for a class of linear observed systems by restricting a
bi-invariant system on a Lie group to its normal subgroup. This structural
property powerfully enables a system immersion of the original system into a
linear time-varying system. Leveraging the immersion, an observer is
constructed by first designing a Kalman-like observer for the immersed system
and then reconstructing the group-valued state via optimization. Under a rank
condition, global exponential stability (GES) is achieved provided one global
optimum of the reconstruction optimization is found, reflecting the topological
difficulties inherent to the non-Euclidean state space. Semi-global stability
is guaranteed when input biases are jointly estimated. The theory is applied to
the GES observer design for two-frame systems, capable of modeling a family of
navigation problems. Two non-trivial examples are provided to illustrate
implementation details.

Conclusion: NMC是一种通用且可编程的低功耗计算架构，适用于稀疏算法和迭代优化等特定应用场景。

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing (NMC) is increasingly viewed as a low-power
alternative to conventional von Neumann architectures such as central
processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs), however the
computational value proposition has been difficult to define precisely.
  Here, we explain how NMC should be seen as general-purpose and programmable
even though it differs considerably from a conventional stored-program
architecture. We show that the time and space scaling of NMC is equivalent to
that of a theoretically infinite processor conventional system, however the
energy scaling is significantly different. Specifically, the energy of
conventional systems scales with absolute algorithm work, whereas the energy of
neuromorphic systems scales with the derivative of algorithm state. The unique
characteristics of NMC architectures make it well suited for different classes
of algorithms than conventional multi-core systems like GPUs that have been
optimized for dense numerical applications such as linear algebra. In contrast,
the unique characteristics of NMC make it ideally suited for scalable and
sparse algorithms whose activity is proportional to an objective function, such
as iterative optimization and large-scale sampling (e.g., Monte Carlo).

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升乘法器能效，适用于生产系统，且通过进一步优化可实现更高能效。

Abstract: This work presents a method to maximize power-efficiency of fixed point
multiplier units by decomposing them into sub-components. First, an encoder
block converts the operands from a two's complement to a sign magnitude
representation, followed by a multiplier module which performs the compute
operation and outputs the resulting value in the original format. This allows
to leverage the power-efficiency of the Sign Magnitude encoding for the
multiplication. To ensure the computing format is not altered, those two
components are synthesized and optimized separately. Our method leads to
significant power savings for input values centered around zero, as commonly
encountered in AI workloads. Under a realistic input stream with values
normally distributed with a standard deviation of 3.0, post-synthesis
simulations of the 4-bit multiplier design show up to 12.9% lower switching
activity compared to synthesis without decomposition. Those gains are achieved
while ensuring compliance into any production-ready system as the overall
circuit stays logic-equivalent. With the compliance lifted and a slightly
smaller input range of -7 to +7, switching activity reductions can reach up to
33%. Additionally, we demonstrate that synthesis optimization methods based on
switching-activity-driven design space exploration can yield a further 5-10%
improvement in power-efficiency compared to a power agnostic approach.

Abstract: Echo-State Networks (ESNs) distil a key neurobiological insight: richly
recurrent but fixed circuitry combined with adaptive linear read-outs can
transform temporal streams with remarkable efficiency. Yet fundamental
questions about stability, memory and expressive power remain fragmented across
disciplines. We present a unified, dynamical-systems treatment that weaves
together functional analysis, random attractor theory and recent
neuroscientific findings. First, on compact multivariate input alphabets we
prove that the Echo-State Property (wash-out of initial conditions) together
with global Lipschitz dynamics necessarily yields the Fading-Memory Property
(geometric forgetting of remote inputs). Tight algebraic tests translate
activation-specific Lipschitz constants into certified spectral-norm bounds,
covering both saturating and rectifying nonlinearities. Second, employing a
Stone-Weierstrass strategy we give a streamlined proof that ESNs with
polynomial reservoirs and linear read-outs are dense in the Banach space of
causal, time-invariant fading-memory filters, extending universality to
stochastic inputs. Third, we quantify computational resources via
memory-capacity spectrum, show how topology and leak rate redistribute
delay-specific capacities, and link these trade-offs to Lyapunov spectra at the
\textit{edge of chaos}. Finally, casting ESNs as skew-product random dynamical
systems, we establish existence of singleton pullback attractors and derive
conditional Lyapunov bounds, providing a rigorous analogue to cortical
criticality. The analysis yields concrete design rules-spectral radius, input
gain, activation choice-grounded simultaneously in mathematics and
neuroscience, and clarifies why modest-sized reservoirs often rival fully
trained recurrent networks in practice.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于控制理论的预疾病治疗方法MCSC，通过稀疏控制器识别干预候选状态，验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在老龄化社会中延长健康寿命，需在疾病前状态预防疾病，但预疾病治疗的数学框架尚未完善。

Method: 基于马尔可夫链的概率分布时间演化，设计稀疏控制器识别干预候选状态。

Result: 通过数值模拟和真实数据分析验证了MCSC的有效性。

Conclusion: MCSC为预疾病治疗提供了可行的数学框架。

Abstract: To extend healthy life expectancy in an aging society, it is crucial to
prevent various diseases at pre-disease states. Although dynamical network
biomarker theory has been developed for pre-disease detection, mathematical
frameworks for pre-disease treatment have not been well established. Here I
propose a control theory-based approach for pre-disease treatment, named Markov
chain sparse control (MCSC), where time evolution of a probability distribution
on a Markov chain is described as a discrete-time linear system. By designing a
sparse controller, a few candidate states for intervention are identified. The
validity of MCSC is demonstrated using numerical simulations and real-data
analysis.

Abstract: Building on the conceptual framework presented in our previous work on
agentic AI for pharmaceutical research, this paper provides a comprehensive
technical analysis of Tippy's multi-agent system implementation for drug
discovery laboratory automation. We present a distributed microservices
architecture featuring five specialized agents (Supervisor, Molecule, Lab,
Analysis, and Report) that coordinate through OpenAI Agents SDK orchestration
and access laboratory tools via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The system
architecture encompasses agent-specific tool integration, asynchronous
communication patterns, and comprehensive configuration management through
Git-based tracking. Our production deployment strategy utilizes Kubernetes
container orchestration with Helm charts, Docker containerization, and CI/CD
pipelines for automated testing and deployment. The implementation integrates
vector databases for RAG functionality and employs an Envoy reverse proxy for
secure external access. This work demonstrates how specialized AI agents can
effectively coordinate complex laboratory workflows while maintaining security,
scalability, reliability, and integration with existing laboratory
infrastructure through standardized protocols.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于条件自回归图生成的多智能体系统（MAS）设计方法ARG-Designer，解决了现有方法依赖模板和预定义结构的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MAS设计方法依赖模板图和预定义结构，限制了适应性和任务定制能力。

Method: 将MAS设计重新定义为条件自回归图生成任务，提出ARG-Designer模型，动态生成协作图。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，ARG-Designer实现了最优性能，并显著提高了效率和可扩展性。

Conclusion: ARG-Designer通过动态生成协作图，为MAS设计提供了灵活、高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) based on large language models (LLMs) have emerged
as a powerful solution for dealing with complex problems across diverse
domains. The effectiveness of MAS is critically dependent on its collaboration
topology, which has become a focal point for automated design research.
However, existing approaches are fundamentally constrained by their reliance on
a template graph modification paradigm with a predefined set of agents and
hard-coded interaction structures, significantly limiting their adaptability to
task-specific requirements. To address these limitations, we reframe MAS design
as a conditional autoregressive graph generation task, where both the system
composition and structure are designed jointly. We propose ARG-Designer, a
novel autoregressive model that operationalizes this paradigm by constructing
the collaboration graph from scratch. Conditioned on a natural language task
query, ARG-Designer sequentially and dynamically determines the required number
of agents, selects their appropriate roles from an extensible pool, and
establishes the optimal communication links between them. This generative
approach creates a customized topology in a flexible and extensible manner,
precisely tailored to the unique demands of different tasks. Extensive
experiments across six diverse benchmarks demonstrate that ARG-Designer not
only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also enjoys significantly
greater token efficiency and enhanced extensibility. The source code of
ARG-Designer is available at https://github.com/Shiy-Li/ARG-Designer.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于认知博弈论的形式化模型，用于开发符合利益相关者价值观的自主交通代理（ATAs）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保ATAs在安全的同时，还能在法律、社会和道德维度上与利益相关者的价值观保持一致。

Method: 采用认知博弈论中的冲突模型，分析价值冲突，并将其应用于设计过程中的价值提取、能力规范、解释和系统优化。

Result: 提出了Value-Aligned Operational Design Domains（VODDs）概念，用于根据上下文价值优先级构建自主行为。

Conclusion: 通过在设计阶段预测和结构化价值敏感行为，减少运行时道德困境的发生。

Abstract: Autonomous traffic agents (ATAs) are expected to act in ways tat are not only
safe, but also aligned with stakeholder values across legal, social, and moral
dimensions. In this paper, we adopt an established formal model of conflict
from epistemic game theory to support the development of such agents. We focus
on value conflicts-situations in which agents face competing goals rooted in
value-laden situations and show how conflict analysis can inform key phases of
the design process. This includes value elicitation, capability specification,
explanation, and adaptive system refinement. We elaborate and apply the concept
of Value-Aligned Operational Design Domains (VODDs) to structure autonomy in
accordance with contextual value priorities. Our approach shifts the emphasis
from solving moral dilemmas at runtime to anticipating and structuring
value-sensitive behaviour during development.

TL;DR: 提出了一种零样本框架，用于文本到视频模型中的动态概念个性化，无需微调即可生成高质量视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要针对每个实例进行微调，限制了可扩展性，因此需要一种无需微调的动态概念个性化方法。

Method: 利用结构化2x2视频网格组织输入输出对，训练轻量级Grid-LoRA适配器，并通过Grid Fill模块完成部分观察的布局。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能生成高质量且一致的视频，适用于未见过的动态概念和编辑场景。

Conclusion: 该方法在单次前向传播中完成，无需测试时优化，具有高扩展性和通用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have enabled high-quality
synthesis from text and image prompts. While the personalization of dynamic
concepts, which capture subject-specific appearance and motion from a single
video, is now feasible, most existing methods require per-instance fine-tuning,
limiting scalability. We introduce a fully zero-shot framework for dynamic
concept personalization in text-to-video models. Our method leverages
structured 2x2 video grids that spatially organize input and output pairs,
enabling the training of lightweight Grid-LoRA adapters for editing and
composition within these grids. At inference, a dedicated Grid Fill module
completes partially observed layouts, producing temporally coherent and
identity preserving outputs. Once trained, the entire system operates in a
single forward pass, generalizing to previously unseen dynamic concepts without
any test-time optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate high-quality and
consistent results across a wide range of subjects beyond trained concepts and
editing scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: GeoAvatar通过自适应几何处理和高斯点优化，显著提升了3D头部虚拟形象的质量。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in 3D head avatar generation, balancing identity
preservation, i.e., reconstruction, with novel poses and expressions, i.e.,
animation, remains a challenge. Existing methods struggle to adapt Gaussians to
varying geometrical deviations across facial regions, resulting in suboptimal
quality. To address this, we propose GeoAvatar, a framework for adaptive
geometrical Gaussian Splatting. GeoAvatar leverages Adaptive Pre-allocation
Stage (APS), an unsupervised method that segments Gaussians into rigid and
flexible sets for adaptive offset regularization. Then, based on mouth anatomy
and dynamics, we introduce a novel mouth structure and the part-wise
deformation strategy to enhance the animation fidelity of the mouth. Finally,
we propose a regularization loss for precise rigging between Gaussians and 3DMM
faces. Moreover, we release DynamicFace, a video dataset with highly expressive
facial motions. Extensive experiments show the superiority of GeoAvatar
compared to state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction and novel animation
scenarios.

Abstract: Integrating inverse rendering with multi-view photometric stereo (MVPS)
yields more accurate 3D reconstructions than the inverse rendering approaches
that rely on fixed environment illumination. However, efficient inverse
rendering with MVPS remains challenging. To fill this gap, we introduce the
Gaussian Splatting for Multi-view Photometric Stereo (PS-GS), which efficiently
and jointly estimates the geometry, materials, and lighting of the object that
is illuminated by diverse directional lights (multi-light). Our method first
reconstructs a standard 2D Gaussian splatting model as the initial geometry.
Based on the initialization model, it then proceeds with the deferred inverse
rendering by the full rendering equation containing a lighting-computing
multi-layer perceptron. During the whole optimization, we regularize the
rendered normal maps by the uncalibrated photometric stereo estimated normals.
We also propose the 2D Gaussian ray-tracing for single directional light to
refine the incident lighting. The regularizations and the use of multi-view and
multi-light images mitigate the ill-posed problem of inverse rendering. After
optimization, the reconstructed object can be used for novel-view synthesis,
relighting, and material and shape editing. Experiments on both synthetic and
real datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms prior works in terms of
reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: The training of high-quality, robust machine learning models for
speech-driven 3D facial animation requires a large, diverse dataset of
high-quality audio-animation pairs. To overcome the lack of such a dataset,
recent work has introduced large pre-trained speech encoders that are robust to
variations in the input audio and, therefore, enable the facial animation model
to generalize across speakers, audio quality, and languages. However, the
resulting facial animation models are prohibitively large and lend themselves
only to offline inference on a dedicated machine. In this work, we explore
on-device, real-time facial animation models in the context of game
development. We overcome the lack of large datasets by using hybrid knowledge
distillation with pseudo-labeling. Given a large audio dataset, we employ a
high-performing teacher model to train very small student models. In contrast
to the pre-trained speech encoders, our student models only consist of
convolutional and fully-connected layers, removing the need for attention
context or recurrent updates. In our experiments, we demonstrate that we can
reduce the memory footprint to up to 3.4 MB and required future audio context
to up to 81 ms while maintaining high-quality animations. This paves the way
for on-device inference, an important step towards realistic, model-driven
digital characters.
