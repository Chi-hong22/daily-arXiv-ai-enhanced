TL;DR: F-MPPI是一种改进的MPPI框架，通过引入局部线性反馈增益，显著提升了实时控制性能，适用于复杂机器人任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准MPPI在实时高频机器人控制中因计算需求大而受限，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: F-MPPI通过灵敏度分析计算局部线性反馈增益，实现快速闭环修正，避免每一步的完全重新优化。

Result: 在四足机器人和四旋翼飞行器上的实验表明，F-MPPI显著提升了控制性能和稳定性。

Conclusion: F-MPPI通过局部反馈增益实现了高效、鲁棒的实时控制，适用于复杂机器人系统。

Abstract: Model Predictive Path Integral control is a powerful sampling-based approach
suitable for complex robotic tasks due to its flexibility in handling nonlinear
dynamics and non-convex costs. However, its applicability in real-time,
highfrequency robotic control scenarios is limited by computational demands.
This paper introduces Feedback-MPPI (F-MPPI), a novel framework that augments
standard MPPI by computing local linear feedback gains derived from sensitivity
analysis inspired by Riccati-based feedback used in gradient-based MPC. These
gains allow for rapid closed-loop corrections around the current state without
requiring full re-optimization at each timestep. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of F-MPPI through simulations and real-world experiments on two
robotic platforms: a quadrupedal robot performing dynamic locomotion on uneven
terrain and a quadrotor executing aggressive maneuvers with onboard
computation. Results illustrate that incorporating local feedback significantly
improves control performance and stability, enabling robust, high-frequency
operation suitable for complex robotic systems.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation by drones using onboard sensors combined with machine
learning and computer vision algorithms is impacting a number of domains,
including agriculture, logistics, and disaster management. In this paper, we
examine the use of drones for assisting visually impaired people (VIPs) in
navigating through outdoor urban environments. Specifically, we present a
perception-based path planning system for local planning around the
neighborhood of the VIP, integrated with a global planner based on GPS and maps
for coarse planning. We represent the problem using a geometric formulation and
propose a multi DNN based framework for obstacle avoidance of the UAV as well
as the VIP. Our evaluations conducted on a drone human system in a university
campus environment verifies the feasibility of our algorithms in three
scenarios; when the VIP walks on a footpath, near parked vehicles, and in a
crowded street.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的一阶方法ALSPG，通过几何投影改进实时性能，适用于机器人运动生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人运动生成面临复杂挑战，现有方法未能充分利用几何约束。

Method: 采用ALSPG方法，结合欧几里得投影、Minkowski和基函数。

Result: ALSPG在实时性能上显著优于现有方法，并在无约束情况下与二阶方法竞争。

Conclusion: ALSPG在仿真和实际机器人实验中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Generating motions for robots interacting with objects of various shapes is a
complex challenge, further complicated by the robot geometry and multiple
desired behaviors. While current robot programming tools (such as inverse
kinematics, collision avoidance, and manipulation planning) often treat these
problems as constrained optimization, many existing solvers focus on specific
problem domains or do not exploit geometric constraints effectively. We propose
an efficient first-order method, Augmented Lagrangian Spectral Projected
Gradient Descent (ALSPG), which leverages geometric projections via Euclidean
projections, Minkowski sums, and basis functions. We show that by using
geometric constraints rather than full constraints and gradients, ALSPG
significantly improves real-time performance. Compared to second-order methods
like iLQR, ALSPG remains competitive in the unconstrained case. We validate our
method through toy examples and extensive simulations, and demonstrate its
effectiveness on a 7-axis Franka robot, a 6-axis P-Rob robot and a 1:10 scale
car in real-world experiments. Source codes, experimental data and videos are
available on the project webpage: https://sites.google.com/view/alspg-oc

TL;DR: FEAST是一个灵活的用餐辅助系统，支持个性化定制，适应不同用户需求，并通过模块化硬件和多样化交互方法实现安全透明的个性化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决家庭用餐辅助机器人面临的多样化活动和用户需求挑战。

Method: 采用模块化硬件、多样化交互方法和参数化行为树，结合大型语言模型实现个性化定制。

Result: FEAST在透明和安全的个性化方面表现优异，优于固定定制基线，并在实际用户研究中成功满足个体需求。

Conclusion: FEAST展示了在家庭环境中灵活、安全、透明的个性化用餐辅助的潜力。

Abstract: Physical caregiving robots hold promise for improving the quality of life of
millions worldwide who require assistance with feeding. However, in-home meal
assistance remains challenging due to the diversity of activities (e.g.,
eating, drinking, mouth wiping), contexts (e.g., socializing, watching TV),
food items, and user preferences that arise during deployment. In this work, we
propose FEAST, a flexible mealtime-assistance system that can be personalized
in-the-wild to meet the unique needs of individual care recipients. Developed
in collaboration with two community researchers and informed by a formative
study with a diverse group of care recipients, our system is guided by three
key tenets for in-the-wild personalization: adaptability, transparency, and
safety. FEAST embodies these principles through: (i) modular hardware that
enables switching between assisted feeding, drinking, and mouth-wiping, (ii)
diverse interaction methods, including a web interface, head gestures, and
physical buttons, to accommodate diverse functional abilities and preferences,
and (iii) parameterized behavior trees that can be safely and transparently
adapted using a large language model. We evaluate our system based on the
personalization requirements identified in our formative study, demonstrating
that FEAST offers a wide range of transparent and safe adaptations and
outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline limited to fixed customizations. To
demonstrate real-world applicability, we conduct an in-home user study with two
care recipients (who are community researchers), feeding them three meals each
across three diverse scenarios. We further assess FEAST's ecological validity
by evaluating with an Occupational Therapist previously unfamiliar with the
system. In all cases, users successfully personalize FEAST to meet their
individual needs and preferences. Website: https://emprise.cs.cornell.edu/feast

### [5] [Time-Optimized Safe Navigation in Unstructured Environments through Learning Based Depth Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14975)

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于轻量级传感器的四旋翼无人机实时导航系统，通过融合立体和单目深度估计构建密集3D地图，并实现时间最优的全局轨迹规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 四旋翼无人机在复杂未知环境中实现自主导航面临传感器限制和实时计算的挑战。

Method: 采用视觉深度估计融合技术构建3D地图，结合快速全局轨迹规划和实时更新策略。

Result: 系统在计算效率和避障能力上优于现有方法，并通过室内外实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该系统为四旋翼无人机在未知环境中的安全自主导航提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Quadrotors hold significant promise for several applications such as
agriculture, search and rescue, and infrastructure inspection. Achieving
autonomous operation requires systems to navigate safely through complex and
unfamiliar environments. This level of autonomy is particularly challenging due
to the complexity of such environments and the need for real-time decision
making especially for platforms constrained by size, weight, and power (SWaP),
which limits flight time and precludes the use of bulky sensors like Light
Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) for mapping. Furthermore, computing globally
optimal, collision-free paths and translating them into time-optimized, safe
trajectories in real time adds significant computational complexity. To address
these challenges, we present a fully onboard, real-time navigation system that
relies solely on lightweight onboard sensors. Our system constructs a dense 3D
map of the environment using a novel visual depth estimation approach that
fuses stereo and monocular learning-based depth, yielding longer-range, denser,
and less noisy depth maps than conventional stereo methods. Building on this
map, we introduce a novel planning and trajectory generation framework capable
of rapidly computing time-optimal global trajectories. As the map is
incrementally updated with new depth information, our system continuously
refines the trajectory to maintain safety and optimality. Both our planner and
trajectory generator outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of
computational efficiency and guarantee obstacle-free trajectories. We validate
our system through robust autonomous flight experiments in diverse indoor and
outdoor environments, demonstrating its effectiveness for safe navigation in
previously unknown settings.

### [6] [Six-DoF Hand-Based Teleoperation for Omnidirectional Aerial Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15009)
*Jinjie Li,Jiaxuan Li,Kotaro Kaneko,Liming Shu,Moju Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用人类手部全方位运动实现空中机器人远程操作的系统，通过手势和运动跟踪实现多模式交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有远程操作方法未能充分利用全向旋转自由度，且未充分利用人类手指的灵活性。

Method: 系统包括肩部和手部运动跟踪标记及数据手套，设计了四种交互模式以适应不同任务。

Result: 在真实阀门旋转任务中验证了系统的有效性，展示了各模式对精确操作的贡献。

Conclusion: 该框架将人类灵活性与空中机器人结合，为复杂环境中的远程操作提供了新思路。

Abstract: Omnidirectional aerial robots offer full 6-DoF independent control over
position and orientation, making them popular for aerial manipulation. Although
advancements in robotic autonomy, operating by human remains essential in
complex aerial environments. Existing teleoperation approaches for multirotors
fail to fully leverage the additional DoFs provided by omnidirectional
rotation. Additionally, the dexterity of human fingers should be exploited for
more engaged interaction. In this work, we propose an aerial teleoperation
system that brings the omnidirectionality of human hands into the unbounded
aerial workspace. Our system includes two motion-tracking marker sets -- one on
the shoulder and one on the hand -- along with a data glove to capture hand
gestures. Using these inputs, we design four interaction modes for different
tasks, including Spherical Mode and Cartesian Mode for long-range moving as
well as Operation Mode and Locking Mode for precise manipulation, where the
hand gestures are utilized for seamless mode switching. We evaluate our system
on a valve-turning task in real world, demonstrating how each mode contributes
to effective aerial manipulation. This interaction framework bridges human
dexterity with aerial robotics, paving the way for enhanced teleoperated aerial
manipulation in unstructured environments.

### [7] [Context Matters: Learning Generalizable Rewards via Calibrated Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15012)
*Alexandra Forsey-Smerek,Julie Shah,Andreea Bobu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种显式建模上下文不变偏好与上下文相关特征显著性的方法，显著提高了奖励学习的样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将每个新上下文视为独立任务，导致数据需求大且效率低。本文观察到上下文影响的是特征显著性而非偏好本身，因此提出显式分离建模以提高效率。

Method: 引入校准特征捕捉上下文对特征显著性的影响，并设计专用配对比较查询以高效学习。

Result: 实验表明，该方法比基线方法少用10倍偏好查询即可达到相同奖励准确性，在低数据量下性能提升15%。用户研究证实其有效性。

Conclusion: 显式分离建模偏好与特征显著性能显著提升奖励学习的适应性和个性化能力。

Abstract: A key challenge in reward learning from human input is that desired agent
behavior often changes based on context. Traditional methods typically treat
each new context as a separate task with its own reward function. For example,
if a previously ignored stove becomes too hot to be around, the robot must
learn a new reward from scratch, even though the underlying preference for
prioritizing safety over efficiency remains unchanged. We observe that context
influences not the underlying preference itself, but rather the
$\textit{saliency}$--or importance--of reward features. For instance, stove
heat affects the importance of the robot's proximity, yet the human's safety
preference stays the same. Existing multi-task and meta IRL methods learn
context-dependent representations $\textit{implicitly}$--without distinguishing
between preferences and feature importance--resulting in substantial data
requirements. Instead, we propose $\textit{explicitly}$ modeling
context-invariant preferences separately from context-dependent feature
saliency, creating modular reward representations that adapt to new contexts.
To achieve this, we introduce $\textit{calibrated features}$--representations
that capture contextual effects on feature saliency--and present specialized
paired comparison queries that isolate saliency from preference for efficient
learning. Experiments with simulated users show our method significantly
improves sample efficiency, requiring 10x fewer preference queries than
baselines to achieve equivalent reward accuracy, with up to 15% better
performance in low-data regimes (5-10 queries). An in-person user study (N=12)
demonstrates that participants can effectively teach their unique personal
contextual preferences using our method, enabling more adaptable and
personalized reward learning.

*Winston Smith,Andrew Boateng,Taha Shaheen,Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多任务机器人任务分配框架，考虑了多任务引入的物理约束，并通过加权MAX-SAT和贪心启发式方法实现高效分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有任务分配方法假设机器人单任务运行，这在某些场景下效率低下或不可行，因此需要支持多任务分配。

Method: 提出了一种任务分配框架，将问题编译为加权MAX-SAT问题，并引入贪心启发式方法。

Result: 在合成领域和模拟场景中验证了多任务分配的优势，并通过物理实验展示了实际效率提升。

Conclusion: 多任务分配框架能显著提升任务效率，尤其在复杂任务交互场景中表现优异。

Abstract: One simplifying assumption in existing and well-performing task allocation
methods is that the robots are single-tasking: each robot operates on a single
task at any given time. While this assumption is harmless to make in some
situations, it can be inefficient or even infeasible in others. In this paper,
we consider assigning multi-robot tasks to multitasking robots. The key
contribution is a novel task allocation framework that incorporates the
consideration of physical constraints introduced by multitasking. This is in
contrast to the existing work where such constraints are largely ignored. After
formulating the problem, we propose a compilation to weighted MAX-SAT, which
allows us to leverage existing solvers for a solution. A more efficient greedy
heuristic is then introduced. For evaluation, we first compare our methods with
a modern baseline that is efficient for single-tasking robots to validate the
benefits of multitasking in synthetic domains. Then, using a site-clearing
scenario in simulation, we further illustrate the complex task interaction
considered by the multitasking robots in our approach to demonstrate its
performance. Finally, we demonstrate a physical experiment to show how
multitasking enabled by our approach can benefit task efficiency in a realistic
setting.

### [9] [EmojiVoice: Towards long-term controllable expressivity in robot speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15085)
*Paige Tuttösí,Shivam Mehta,Zachary Syvenky,Bermet Burkanova,Gustav Eje Henter,Angelica Lim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: EmojiVoice是一个免费的、可定制的文本转语音工具包，旨在为社交机器人提供长期变化的表达性语音，通过表情符号提示实现细粒度控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交机器人通常使用单调的“快乐”语音，缺乏人类语音中的长期变化，而现有的基础模型难以离线部署。

Method: 使用轻量级Matcha-TTS框架和表情符号提示技术，实现实时生成表达性语音。

Result: 在讲故事任务中，表情符号提示显著提升了语音的感知和表达性，但在助手场景中表达性语音不受欢迎。

Conclusion: EmojiVoice为社交机器人提供了灵活的表达性语音生成方案，但需根据场景调整使用。

Abstract: Humans vary their expressivity when speaking for extended periods to maintain
engagement with their listener. Although social robots tend to be deployed with
``expressive'' joyful voices, they lack this long-term variation found in human
speech. Foundation model text-to-speech systems are beginning to mimic the
expressivity in human speech, but they are difficult to deploy offline on
robots. We present EmojiVoice, a free, customizable text-to-speech (TTS)
toolkit that allows social roboticists to build temporally variable, expressive
speech on social robots. We introduce emoji-prompting to allow fine-grained
control of expressivity on a phase level and use the lightweight Matcha-TTS
backbone to generate speech in real-time. We explore three case studies: (1) a
scripted conversation with a robot assistant, (2) a storytelling robot, and (3)
an autonomous speech-to-speech interactive agent. We found that using varied
emoji prompting improved the perception and expressivity of speech over a long
period in a storytelling task, but expressive voice was not preferred in the
assistant use case.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的视觉触觉传感器（VTS），通过引入棱镜和近红外相机扩展成像通道，解决了曲面触觉感知中的光照不足和重建模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了实现仿人手的触觉感知，需要将传统的平面VTS扩展到生物仿生曲面结构，但现有技术面临光照不足、重建模糊和复杂边界条件等挑战。

Method: 研究开发了GelSplitter3D，结合棱镜和近红外相机；提出了一种基于CAD的光度立体神经网络校准触觉几何；设计了带有深度先验信息的边界约束法纠正表面积分误差。

Result: 实验表明，触觉感知性能显著提升，法线估计精度提高了40%，传感器形状在抓取和操作任务中表现出优势。

Conclusion: 该研究为仿人手触觉传感器的曲面设计提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了触觉感知的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: To achieve human-like haptic perception in anthropomorphic grippers, the
compliant sensing surfaces of vision tactile sensor (VTS) must evolve from
conventional planar configurations to biomimetically curved topographies with
continuous surface gradients. However, planar VTSs have challenges when
extended to curved surfaces, including insufficient lighting of surfaces,
blurring in reconstruction, and complex spatial boundary conditions for surface
structures. With an end goal of constructing a human-like fingertip, our
research (i) develops GelSplitter3D by expanding imaging channels with a prism
and a near-infrared (NIR) camera, (ii) proposes a photometric stereo neural
network with a CAD-based normal ground truth generation method to calibrate
tactile geometry, and (iii) devises a normal integration method with boundary
constraints of depth prior information to correcting the cumulative error of
surface integrals. We demonstrate better tactile sensing performance, a 40$\%$
improvement in normal estimation accuracy, and the benefits of sensor shapes in
grasping and manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: DyNaVLM通过三项创新（动态动作空间、协作图记忆、无训练部署），为可扩展的机器人导航建立了新范式。

Abstract: We present DyNaVLM, an end-to-end vision-language navigation framework using
Vision-Language Models (VLM). In contrast to prior methods constrained by fixed
angular or distance intervals, our system empowers agents to freely select
navigation targets via visual-language reasoning. At its core lies a
self-refining graph memory that 1) stores object locations as executable
topological relations, 2) enables cross-robot memory sharing through
distributed graph updates, and 3) enhances VLM's decision-making via retrieval
augmentation. Operating without task-specific training or fine-tuning, DyNaVLM
demonstrates high performance on GOAT and ObjectNav benchmarks. Real-world
tests further validate its robustness and generalization. The system's three
innovations: dynamic action space formulation, collaborative graph memory, and
training-free deployment, establish a new paradigm for scalable embodied robot,
bridging the gap between discrete VLN tasks and continuous real-world
navigation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏针对语言教学机器人的任务特定语音合成，这可能影响教学效果。

Method: 1. 使用微调的Matcha-TTS和表情符号提示创建表达力强的语音；2. 根据环境调整语音的音高和速率；3. 为L2学习者优化英语TTS系统，通过延长紧张元音提高清晰度。

Conclusion: 任务特定的语音合成能显著提升语言教学机器人的效果，尤其在表达力和环境适应性方面。

Abstract: While the use of social robots for language teaching has been explored, there
remains limited work on a task-specific synthesized voices for language
teaching robots. Given that language is a verbal task, this gap may have severe
consequences for the effectiveness of robots for language teaching tasks. We
address this lack of L2 teaching robot voices through three contributions: 1.
We address the need for a lightweight and expressive robot voice. Using a
fine-tuned version of Matcha-TTS, we use emoji prompting to create an
expressive voice that shows a range of expressivity over time. The voice can
run in real time with limited compute resources. Through case studies, we found
this voice more expressive, socially appropriate, and suitable for long periods
of expressive speech, such as storytelling. 2. We explore how to adapt a
robot's voice to physical and social ambient environments to deploy our voices
in various locations. We found that increasing pitch and pitch rate in noisy
and high-energy environments makes the robot's voice appear more appropriate
and makes it seem more aware of its current environment. 3. We create an
English TTS system with improved clarity for L2 listeners using known
linguistic properties of vowels that are difficult for these listeners. We used
a data-driven, perception-based approach to understand how L2 speakers use
duration cues to interpret challenging words with minimal tense (long) and lax
(short) vowels in English. We found that the duration of vowels strongly
influences the perception for L2 listeners and created an "L2 clarity mode" for
Matcha-TTS that applies a lengthening to tense vowels while leaving lax vowels
unchanged. Our clarity mode was found to be more respectful, intelligible, and
encouraging than base Matcha-TTS while reducing transcription errors in these
challenging tense/lax minimal pairs.

Result: 实验表明，VIMS在水下环境中显著提高了状态估计的鲁棒性和准确性。

Conclusion: VIMS通过创新的传感器融合和分层方案，有效解决了水下SLAM的挑战。

Abstract: In this study, we present a novel simultaneous localization and mapping
(SLAM) system, VIMS, designed for underwater navigation. Conventional
visual-inertial state estimators encounter significant practical challenges in
perceptually degraded underwater environments, particularly in scale estimation
and loop closing. To address these issues, we first propose leveraging a
low-cost single-beam sonar to improve scale estimation. Then, VIMS integrates a
high-sampling-rate magnetometer for place recognition by utilizing magnetic
signatures generated by an economical magnetic field coil. Building on this, a
hierarchical scheme is developed for visual-magnetic place recognition,
enabling robust loop closure. Furthermore, VIMS achieves a balance between
local feature tracking and descriptor-based loop closing, avoiding additional
computational burden on the front end. Experimental results highlight the
efficacy of the proposed VIMS, demonstrating significant improvements in both
the robustness and accuracy of state estimation within underwater environments.

Abstract: Recent advancements in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to significant
progress in humanoid robot locomotion, simplifying the design and training of
motion policies in simulation. However, the numerous implementation details
make transferring these policies to real-world robots a challenging task. To
address this, we have developed a comprehensive code framework that covers the
entire process from training to deployment, incorporating common RL training
methods, domain randomization, reward function design, and solutions for
handling parallel structures. This library is made available as a community
resource, with detailed descriptions of its design and experimental results. We
validate the framework on the Booster T1 robot, demonstrating that the trained
policies seamlessly transfer to the physical platform, enabling capabilities
such as omnidirectional walking, disturbance resistance, and terrain
adaptability. We hope this work provides a convenient tool for the robotics
community, accelerating the development of humanoid robots. The code can be

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人形机器人在全身接触操作中面临的高计算成本和广泛接触测量难题。

Conclusion: TACT策略成功实现了人形机器人的全身接触操作，同时保持平衡和行走能力。

Abstract: Manipulation with whole-body contact by humanoid robots offers distinct
advantages, including enhanced stability and reduced load. On the other hand,
we need to address challenges such as the increased computational cost of
motion generation and the difficulty of measuring broad-area contact. We
therefore have developed a humanoid control system that allows a humanoid robot
equipped with tactile sensors on its upper body to learn a policy for
whole-body manipulation through imitation learning based on human teleoperation
data. This policy, named tactile-modality extended ACT (TACT), has a feature to
take multiple sensor modalities as input, including joint position, vision, and
tactile measurements. Furthermore, by integrating this policy with retargeting
and locomotion control based on a biped model, we demonstrate that the
life-size humanoid robot RHP7 Kaleido is capable of achieving whole-body
contact manipulation while maintaining balance and walking. Through detailed
experimental verification, we show that inputting both vision and tactile

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在步态变化时高精度和鲁棒性不足的问题，提升外骨骼对个体步态变化的适应能力。

Method: 结合时间卷积和Transformer层，提出通道掩码重建预训练策略，将步态相位状态向量与IMU信号联合建模。

Result: 在稳定地形下步态相位RMSE为2.729±1.071%，地形变化时为3.215±1.303%，硬件验证证实其可靠性和适应性。

Conclusion: 该方法为更智能、自适应的外骨骼系统奠定了基础，提升人机交互的安全性和效率。

Abstract: Gait phase estimation based on inertial measurement unit (IMU) signals
facilitates precise adaptation of exoskeletons to individual gait variations.
However, challenges remain in achieving high accuracy and robustness,
particularly during periods of terrain changes. To address this, we develop a
gait phase estimation neural network based on implicit modeling of human
locomotion, which combines temporal convolution for feature extraction with
transformer layers for multi-channel information fusion. A channel-wise masked
reconstruction pre-training strategy is proposed, which first treats gait phase
state vectors and IMU signals as joint observations of human locomotion, thus
enhancing model generalization. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method outperforms existing baseline approaches, achieving a gait
phase RMSE of $2.729 \pm 1.071%$ and phase rate MAE of $0.037 \pm 0.016%$ under
stable terrain conditions with a look-back window of 2 seconds, and a phase
RMSE of $3.215 \pm 1.303%$ and rate MAE of $0.050 \pm 0.023%$ under terrain
transitions. Hardware validation on a hip exoskeleton further confirms that the
algorithm can reliably identify gait cycles and key events, adapting to various
continuous motion scenarios. This research paves the way for more intelligent
and adaptive exoskeleton systems, enabling safer and more efficient human-robot
interaction across diverse real-world environments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种鲁棒的上下文模仿学习算法（RIP），通过利用Student's t回归模型来减少LLM生成的幻觉轨迹，从而提升任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的即时策略在机器人领域存在幻觉问题，导致轨迹偏离演示，影响可靠性。

Method: 提出RIP算法，生成多个候选轨迹并通过Student's t分布聚合，忽略异常值（幻觉）。

Result: 在仿真和真实环境中，RIP显著优于现有方法，任务成功率提升至少26%。

Conclusion: RIP在低数据场景下表现优异，为日常任务提供了可靠的模仿学习解决方案。

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) aims to enable robots to perform tasks autonomously
by observing a few human demonstrations. Recently, a variant of IL, called
In-Context IL, utilized off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) as instant
policies that understand the context from a few given demonstrations to perform
a new task, rather than explicitly updating network models with large-scale
demonstrations. However, its reliability in the robotics domain is undermined
by hallucination issues such as LLM-based instant policy, which occasionally
generates poor trajectories that deviate from the given demonstrations. To
alleviate this problem, we propose a new robust in-context imitation learning
algorithm called the robust instant policy (RIP), which utilizes a Student's
t-regression model to be robust against the hallucinated trajectories of
instant policies to allow reliable trajectory generation. Specifically, RIP
generates several candidate robot trajectories to complete a given task from an
LLM and aggregates them using the Student's t-distribution, which is beneficial
for ignoring outliers (i.e., hallucinations); thereby, a robust trajectory
against hallucinations is generated. Our experiments, conducted in both
simulated and real-world environments, show that RIP significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art IL methods, with at least $26\%$ improvement in task success
rates, particularly in low-data scenarios for everyday tasks. Video results

TL;DR: SHeRLoc是一种针对异构雷达设计的深度网络，通过RCS极坐标匹配和多尺度特征聚合，显著提升了异构雷达地点识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多局限于同质雷达传感器，忽视了异构雷达技术的集成和跨模态挑战，导致难以泛化到多样雷达数据类型。

Method: 提出SHeRLoc，采用RCS极坐标匹配对齐多模态雷达数据，基于层次最优传输的特征聚合方法生成旋转鲁棒的多尺度描述符，并利用FFT相似性数据挖掘和自适应边界三元组损失实现FOV感知度量学习。

Conclusion: SHeRLoc不仅适用于雷达，还可推广到LiDAR，为跨模态地点识别和异构传感器SLAM开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Despite the growing adoption of radar in robotics, the majority of research
has been confined to homogeneous sensor types, overlooking the integration and
cross-modality challenges inherent in heterogeneous radar technologies. This
leads to significant difficulties in generalizing across diverse radar data
types, with modality-aware approaches that could leverage the complementary
strengths of heterogeneous radar remaining unexplored. To bridge these gaps, we
propose SHeRLoc, the first deep network tailored for heterogeneous radar, which
utilizes RCS polar matching to align multimodal radar data. Our hierarchical
optimal transport-based feature aggregation method generates rotationally
robust multi-scale descriptors. By employing FFT-similarity-based data mining
and adaptive margin-based triplet loss, SHeRLoc enables FOV-aware metric
learning. SHeRLoc achieves an order of magnitude improvement in heterogeneous
radar place recognition, increasing recall@1 from below 0.1 to 0.9 on a public
dataset and outperforming state of-the-art methods. Also applicable to LiDAR,
SHeRLoc paves the way for cross-modal place recognition and heterogeneous
sensor SLAM. The source code will be available upon acceptance.

Motivation: 提高水下滑翔机在放射性源探测任务中的效率，同时确保安全导航。

Method: 评估了TSP、MST和OCP三种路径规划方法，通过MATLAB模拟比较处理时间、未覆盖区域、路径长度和遍历时间。

Result: OCP在时间受限时表现更优，但计算成本高；MST提供快速但次优的解决方案。

Conclusion: 根据任务优先级选择算法，平衡效率和计算可行性。

Abstract: In many applications, including underwater robotics, the coverage problem
requires an autonomous vehicle to systematically explore a defined area while
minimizing redundancy and avoiding obstacles. This paper investigates coverage
path planning strategies to enhance the efficiency of underwater gliders,
particularly in maximizing the probability of detecting a radioactive source
while ensuring safe navigation.
  We evaluate three path-planning approaches: the Traveling Salesman Problem
(TSP), Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), and Optimal Control Problem (OCP).
Simulations were conducted in MATLAB, comparing processing time, uncovered
areas, path length, and traversal time. Results indicate that OCP is preferable
when traversal time is constrained, although it incurs significantly higher
computational costs. Conversely, MST-based approaches provide faster but less
optimal solutions. These findings offer insights into selecting appropriate
algorithms based on mission priorities, balancing efficiency and computational
feasibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂环境中，全局模型难以应对大量不确定的物理对象，因此需要上下文感知的局部模型来提升控制的可泛化性和可解释性。

Method: 扩展DeLaN为上下文感知模型，结合循环网络进行在线系统识别，并与MPC集成；同时利用残差动力学模型增强机器人名义模型。

Result: 在7自由度机械臂的轨迹跟踪实验中，该方法将末端执行器跟踪误差降低了39%，优于基线方法的21%改进。

Conclusion: 上下文感知的DeLaN结合MPC和残差模型，显著提升了复杂环境中的机器人控制性能。

Abstract: Controlling a robot based on physics-informed dynamic models, such as deep
Lagrangian networks (DeLaN), can improve the generalizability and
interpretability of the resulting behavior. However, in complex environments,
the number of objects to potentially interact with is vast, and their physical
properties are often uncertain. This complexity makes it infeasible to employ a
single global model. Therefore, we need to resort to online system
identification of context-aware models that capture only the currently relevant
aspects of the environment. While physical principles such as the conservation
of energy may not hold across varying contexts, ensuring physical plausibility
for any individual context-aware model can still be highly desirable,
particularly when using it for receding horizon control methods such as Model
Predictive Control (MPC). Hence, in this work, we extend DeLaN to make it
context-aware, combine it with a recurrent network for online system
identification, and integrate it with a MPC for adaptive, physics-informed
control. We also combine DeLaN with a residual dynamics model to leverage the
fact that a nominal model of the robot is typically available. We evaluate our
method on a 7-DOF robot arm for trajectory tracking under varying loads. Our
method reduces the end-effector tracking error by 39%, compared to a 21%
improvement achieved by a baseline that uses an extended Kalman filter.

Abstract: Offensive Robot Cybersecurity introduces a groundbreaking approach by
advocating for offensive security methods empowered by means of automation. It
emphasizes the necessity of understanding attackers' tactics and identifying
vulnerabilities in advance to develop effective defenses, thereby improving
robots' security posture. This thesis leverages a decade of robotics
experience, employing Machine Learning and Game Theory to streamline the
vulnerability identification and exploitation process. Intrinsically, the
thesis uncovers a profound connection between robotic architecture and
cybersecurity, highlighting that the design and creation aspect of robotics
deeply intertwines with its protection against attacks. This duality -- whereby
the architecture that shapes robot behavior and capabilities also necessitates
a defense mechanism through offensive and defensive cybersecurity strategies --
creates a unique equilibrium. Approaching cybersecurity with a dual perspective
of defense and attack, rooted in an understanding of systems architecture, has
been pivotal. Through comprehensive analysis, including ethical considerations,
the development of security tools, and executing cyber attacks on robot
software, hardware, and industry deployments, this thesis proposes a novel
architecture for cybersecurity cognitive engines. These engines, powered by
advanced game theory and machine learning, pave the way for autonomous
offensive cybersecurity strategies for robots, marking a significant shift
towards self-defending robotic systems. This research not only underscores the
importance of offensive measures in enhancing robot cybersecurity but also sets
the stage for future advancements where robots are not just resilient to cyber
threats but are equipped to autonomously safeguard themselves.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在动态障碍物环境中导航时，如何高效且稳定地移动障碍物以遵循全局路径的问题。

Method: 采用分层强化学习框架，高层策略生成考虑环境约束的推动指令，低层策略通过全身协调运动精确执行。

Result: 实验显示在导航任务中成功率提高、路径长度缩短、到达时间减少，且障碍物属性估计准确可靠。

Conclusion: 该框架在动态障碍物导航中表现出高效性和可靠性，为复杂环境下的机器人导航提供了新思路。

Abstract: We propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) framework for
efficient Navigation Among Movable Obstacles (NAMO) using a mobile manipulator.
Our approach combines interaction-based obstacle property estimation with
structured pushing strategies, facilitating the dynamic manipulation of
unforeseen obstacles while adhering to a pre-planned global path. The
high-level policy generates pushing commands that consider environmental
constraints and path-tracking objectives, while the low-level policy precisely
and stably executes these commands through coordinated whole-body movements.
Comprehensive simulation-based experiments demonstrate improvements in
performing NAMO tasks, including higher success rates, shortened traversed path
length, and reduced goal-reaching times, compared to baselines. Additionally,
ablation studies assess the efficacy of each component, while a qualitative
analysis further validates the accuracy and reliability of the real-time
obstacle property estimation.

TL;DR: MCOO-SLAM是一种多相机全方位物体SLAM系统，利用环绕视角相机配置，在复杂户外场景中实现鲁棒、一致且语义丰富的建图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SLAM方法依赖RGB-D或单目相机，视野窄、易受遮挡且深度感知有限，导致物体建模不准确和数据关联不可靠。

Method: 整合点特征和物体级地标，引入语义-几何-时间融合策略，设计全方位闭环模块，并构建分层3D场景图。

Result: 实验表明，MCOO-SLAM在定位和物体级建图方面表现准确，对遮挡、姿态变化和环境复杂性具有更强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MCOO-SLAM通过多相机配置和语义增强，显著提升了复杂户外场景中的SLAM性能。

Abstract: Object-level SLAM offers structured and semantically meaningful environment
representations, making it more interpretable and suitable for high-level
robotic tasks. However, most existing approaches rely on RGB-D sensors or
monocular views, which suffer from narrow fields of view, occlusion
sensitivity, and limited depth perception-especially in large-scale or outdoor
environments. These limitations often restrict the system to observing only
partial views of objects from limited perspectives, leading to inaccurate
object modeling and unreliable data association. In this work, we propose
MCOO-SLAM, a novel Multi-Camera Omnidirectional Object SLAM system that fully
leverages surround-view camera configurations to achieve robust, consistent,
and semantically enriched mapping in complex outdoor scenarios. Our approach
integrates point features and object-level landmarks enhanced with
open-vocabulary semantics. A semantic-geometric-temporal fusion strategy is
introduced for robust object association across multiple views, leading to
improved consistency and accurate object modeling, and an omnidirectional loop
closure module is designed to enable viewpoint-invariant place recognition
using scene-level descriptors. Furthermore, the constructed map is abstracted
into a hierarchical 3D scene graph to support downstream reasoning tasks.
Extensive experiments in real-world demonstrate that MCOO-SLAM achieves
accurate localization and scalable object-level mapping with improved
robustness to occlusion, pose variation, and environmental complexity.

Conclusion: SurfAAV为水下、水面和空中运动提供了一种高效新方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in the research of aquatic-aerial robots,
existing configurations struggle to efficiently perform underwater, surface,
and aerial movement simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel
multimodal surfing aquatic-aerial vehicle, SurfAAV, which efficiently
integrates underwater navigation, surface gliding, and aerial flying
capabilities. Thanks to the design of the novel differential thrust vectoring
hydrofoil, SurfAAV can achieve efficient surface gliding and underwater
navigation without the need for a buoyancy adjustment system. This design
provides flexible operational capabilities for both surface and underwater
tasks, enabling the robot to quickly carry out underwater monitoring
activities. Additionally, when it is necessary to reach another water body,
SurfAAV can switch to aerial mode through a gliding takeoff, flying to the
target water area to perform corresponding tasks. The main contribution of this
letter lies in proposing a new solution for underwater, surface, and aerial
movement, designing a novel hybrid prototype concept, developing the required
control laws, and validating the robot's ability to successfully perform
surface gliding and gliding takeoff. SurfAAV achieves a maximum surface gliding
speed of 7.96 m/s and a maximum underwater speed of 3.1 m/s. The prototype's
surface gliding maneuverability and underwater cruising maneuverability both
exceed those of existing aquatic-aerial vehicles.

Conclusion: 该方法显著优于现有技术，适用于实际应用，代码已开源。

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for the real-time initialization of unknown
Ultra-Wideband (UWB) anchors in UWB-aided navigation systems. The method is
designed for localization solutions where UWB modules act as supplementary
sensors. Our approach enables the automatic detection and calibration of
previously unknown anchors during operation, removing the need for manual
setup. By combining an online Positional Dilution of Precision (PDOP)
estimation, a lightweight outlier detection method, and an adaptive robust
kernel for non-linear optimization, our approach significantly improves
robustness and suitability for real-world applications compared to
state-of-the-art. In particular, we show that our metric which triggers an
initialization decision is more conservative than current ones commonly based
on initial linear or non-linear initialization guesses. This allows for better
initialization geometry and subsequently lower initialization errors. We
demonstrate the proposed approach on two different mobile robots: an autonomous
forklift and a quadcopter equipped with a UWB-aided Visual-Inertial Odometry
(VIO) framework. The results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed method
with robust initialization and low positioning error. We open-source our code
in a C++ library including a ROS wrapper.

Abstract: The workspace limits the operational capabilities and range of motion for the
systems with robotic arms. Maximizing workspace utilization has the potential
to provide more optimal solutions for aerial manipulation tasks, increasing the
system's flexibility and operational efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a
novel planning framework for aerial grasping that maximizes workspace
utilization. We formulate an optimization problem to optimize the aerial
manipulator's trajectory, incorporating task constraints to achieve efficient
manipulation. To address the challenge of incorporating the delta arm's
non-convex workspace into optimization constraints, we leverage a Multilayer
Perceptron (MLP) to map position points to feasibility
probabilities.Furthermore, we employ Reversible Residual Networks (RevNet) to
approximate the complex forward kinematics of the delta arm, utilizing
efficient model gradients to eliminate workspace constraints. We validate our
methods in simulations and real-world experiments to demonstrate their
effectiveness.

Result: GRIM仅需少量示例即可实现强泛化性能。

Conclusion: GRIM为任务导向抓取提供了一种高效、无需训练的解决方案。

Abstract: Task-Oriented Grasping (TOG) presents a significant challenge, requiring a
nuanced understanding of task semantics, object affordances, and the functional
constraints dictating how an object should be grasped for a specific task. To
address these challenges, we introduce GRIM (Grasp Re-alignment via Iterative
Matching), a novel training-free framework for task-oriented grasping.
Initially, a coarse alignment strategy is developed using a combination of
geometric cues and principal component analysis (PCA)-reduced DINO features for
similarity scoring. Subsequently, the full grasp pose associated with the
retrieved memory instance is transferred to the aligned scene object and
further refined against a set of task-agnostic, geometrically stable grasps
generated for the scene object, prioritizing task compatibility. In contrast to
existing learning-based methods, GRIM demonstrates strong generalization
capabilities, achieving robust performance with only a small number of
conditioning examples.

Conclusion: ViA通过结合硬件设计和学习策略，为机器人主动感知和操作任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We present Vision in Action (ViA), an active perception system for bimanual
robot manipulation. ViA learns task-relevant active perceptual strategies
(e.g., searching, tracking, and focusing) directly from human demonstrations.
On the hardware side, ViA employs a simple yet effective 6-DoF robotic neck to
enable flexible, human-like head movements. To capture human active perception
strategies, we design a VR-based teleoperation interface that creates a shared
observation space between the robot and the human operator. To mitigate VR
motion sickness caused by latency in the robot's physical movements, the
interface uses an intermediate 3D scene representation, enabling real-time view
rendering on the operator side while asynchronously updating the scene with the
robot's latest observations. Together, these design elements enable the
learning of robust visuomotor policies for three complex, multi-stage bimanual
manipulation tasks involving visual occlusions, significantly outperforming

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of deformable objects is challenging due to their
diverse physical properties and the difficulty of estimating states from
limited visual information. We address these challenges with a neural dynamics
framework that combines object particles and spatial grids in a hybrid
representation. Our particle-grid model captures global shape and motion
information while predicting dense particle movements, enabling the modeling of
objects with varied shapes and materials. Particles represent object shapes,
while the spatial grid discretizes the 3D space to ensure spatial continuity
and enhance learning efficiency. Coupled with Gaussian Splattings for visual
rendering, our framework achieves a fully learning-based digital twin of
deformable objects and generates 3D action-conditioned videos. Through
experiments, we demonstrate that our model learns the dynamics of diverse
objects -- such as ropes, cloths, stuffed animals, and paper bags -- from
sparse-view RGB-D recordings of robot-object interactions, while also
generalizing at the category level to unseen instances. Our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art learning-based and physics-based simulators,
particularly in scenarios with limited camera views. Furthermore, we showcase
the utility of our learned models in model-based planning, enabling
goal-conditioned object manipulation across a range of tasks. The project page

Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) continue to evolve, their
cognitive and reasoning capabilities have seen remarkable progress. However,
challenges in visual fine-grained perception and commonsense causal inference
persist. This paper introduces Argus Inspection, a multimodal benchmark with
two levels of difficulty, emphasizing detailed visual recognition while
incorporating real-world commonsense understanding to evaluate causal reasoning
abilities. Expanding on it, we present the Eye of Panoptes framework, which
integrates a binary parametric Sigmoid metric with an indicator function,
enabling a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs' responses in opinion-based
reasoning tasks. Experiments conducted on 26 mainstream MLLMs reveal that the
highest performance in visual fine-grained reasoning reaches only 0.46,
highlighting considerable potential for enhancement. Our research offers
valuable perspectives for the continued refinement of MLLMs.

Conclusion: ViLLa通过分离感知、理解和推理，提供了透明且模块化的解决方案。

Abstract: Monitoring animal populations in natural environments requires systems that
can interpret both visual data and human language queries. This work introduces
ViLLa (Vision-Language-Logic Approach), a neuro-symbolic framework designed for
interpretable animal monitoring. ViLLa integrates three core components: a
visual detection module for identifying animals and their spatial locations in
images, a language parser for understanding natural language queries, and a
symbolic reasoning layer that applies logic-based inference to answer those
queries. Given an image and a question such as "How many dogs are in the
scene?" or "Where is the buffalo?", the system grounds visual detections into
symbolic facts and uses predefined rules to compute accurate answers related to
count, presence, and location. Unlike end-to-end black-box models, ViLLa
separates perception, understanding, and reasoning, offering modularity and
transparency. The system was evaluated on a range of animal imagery tasks and
demonstrates the ability to bridge visual content with structured,
human-interpretable queries.

Method: 提出Dual Gaussians Graph Attention，动态构建几何图和语义图，结合多尺度图注意力框架优化边界和拓扑。

Result: 在SurroundOcc数据集上mIoU达24.10%，GPU内存降至6.1GB，性能提升1.97%，内存减少13.7%。

Conclusion: GraphGSOcc模型有效提升3D语义占用预测性能，同时降低计算资源需求。

Abstract: Addressing the task of 3D semantic occupancy prediction for autonomous
driving, we tackle two key issues in existing 3D Gaussian Splating (3DGS)
methods: (1) unified feature aggregation neglecting semantic correlations among
similar categories and across regions, and (2) boundary ambiguities caused by
the lack of geometric constraints in MLP iterative optimization. We propose the
GraphGSOcc model, a novel framework that combines semantic and geometric graph
Transformer for 3D Gaussian Splating-based Occupancy Prediction. We propose the
Dual Gaussians Graph Attenntion, which dynamically constructs dual graph
structures: a geometric graph adaptively calculating KNN search radii based on
Gaussian poses, enabling large-scale Gaussians to aggregate features from
broader neighborhoods while compact Gaussians focus on local geometric
consistency; a semantic graph retaining top-M highly correlated nodes via
cosine similarity to explicitly encode semantic relationships within and across
instances. Coupled with the Multi-scale Graph Attention framework, fine-grained
attention at lower layers optimizes boundary details, while coarse-grained
attention at higher layers models object-level topology. Experiments on the
SurroundOcc dataset achieve an mIoU of 24.10%, reducing GPU memory to 6.1 GB,
demonstrating a 1.97% mIoU improvement and 13.7% memory reduction compared to
GaussianWorld

Conclusion: 可解释的检测方法为AI生成视频的可信识别提供了新方向。

Abstract: As AI-generated video becomes increasingly pervasive across media platforms,
the ability to reliably distinguish synthetic content from authentic footage
has become both urgent and essential. Existing approaches have primarily
treated this challenge as a binary classification task, offering limited
insight into where or why a model identifies a video as AI-generated. However,
the core challenge extends beyond simply detecting subtle artifacts; it
requires providing fine-grained, persuasive evidence that can convince auditors
and end-users alike. To address this critical gap, we introduce DAVID-X, the
first dataset to pair AI-generated videos with detailed defect-level,
temporal-spatial annotations and written rationales. Leveraging these rich
annotations, we present DAVID-XR1, a video-language model designed to deliver
an interpretable chain of visual reasoning-including defect categorization,
temporal-spatial localization, and natural language explanations. This approach
fundamentally transforms AI-generated video detection from an opaque black-box
decision into a transparent and verifiable diagnostic process. We demonstrate
that a general-purpose backbone, fine-tuned on our compact dataset and enhanced
with chain-of-thought distillation, achieves strong generalization across a
variety of generators and generation modes. Our results highlight the promise
of explainable detection methods for trustworthy identification of AI-generated
video content.

Conclusion: 视频-SALMONN 2通过MrDPO和LoRA优化，在视频描述任务中表现出色，同时在小规模模型中保持竞争力。

Abstract: Videos contain a wealth of information, and generating detailed and accurate
descriptions in natural language is a key aspect of video understanding. In
this paper, we present video-SALMONN 2, an advanced audio-visual large language
model (LLM) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) designed for enhanced video (with
paired audio) captioning through directed preference optimisation (DPO). We
propose new metrics to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of video
descriptions, which are optimised using DPO. To further improve training, we
propose a novel multi-round DPO (MrDPO) approach, which involves periodically
updating the DPO reference model, merging and re-initialising the LoRA module
as a proxy for parameter updates after each training round (1,000 steps), and
incorporating guidance from ground-truth video captions to stabilise the
process. Experimental results show that MrDPO significantly enhances
video-SALMONN 2's captioning accuracy, reducing the captioning error rates by
28\%. The final video-SALMONN 2 model, with just 7 billion parameters,
surpasses leading models such as GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro in video captioning
tasks, while maintaining highly competitive performance to the state-of-the-art
on widely used video question-answering benchmarks among models of similar

Result: 在KITTI和nuScenes数据集上表现优异，具有广泛适用性。

Conclusion: MonoVQD显著提升了单目和多视角3D检测的性能，展示了强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Precisely localizing 3D objects from a single image constitutes a central
challenge in monocular 3D detection. While DETR-like architectures offer a
powerful paradigm, their direct application in this domain encounters inherent
limitations, preventing optimal performance. Our work addresses these
challenges by introducing MonoVQD, a novel framework designed to fundamentally
advance DETR-based monocular 3D detection. We propose three main contributions.
First, we propose the Mask Separated Self-Attention mechanism that enables the
integration of the denoising process into a DETR architecture. This improves
the stability of Hungarian matching to achieve a consistent optimization
objective. Second, we present the Variational Query Denoising technique to
address the gradient vanishing problem of conventional denoising methods, which
severely restricts the efficiency of the denoising process. This explicitly
introduces stochastic properties to mitigate this fundamental limitation and
unlock substantial performance gains. Finally, we introduce a sophisticated
self-distillation strategy, leveraging insights from later decoder layers to
synergistically improve query quality in earlier layers, thereby amplifying the
iterative refinement process. Rigorous experimentation demonstrates that
MonoVQD achieves superior performance on the challenging KITTI monocular
benchmark. Highlighting its broad applicability, MonoVQD's core components
seamlessly integrate into other architectures, delivering significant
performance gains even in multi-view 3D detection scenarios on the nuScenes
dataset and underscoring its robust generalization capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MLLMs在图表到代码生成任务中表现不佳，直接提示模型生成代码效果不理想。因此，需要一种方法能够更精确地理解视觉元素并将其转化为结构化代码。

Method: 提出ChartIR方法，将任务分为视觉理解和代码翻译两部分。设计描述和差异两种结构化指令，将视觉特征转化为语言表示。进一步将生成流程分为初始代码生成和迭代优化两个阶段。

Result: 实验表明，ChartIR在开源模型Qwen2-VL和闭源模型GPT-4o上均优于其他方法。

Conclusion: ChartIR通过结构化指令和迭代优化，显著提升了MLLMs在图表到代码生成任务中的性能。

Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have attracted increasing
research attention due to their powerful visual understanding capabilities.
While they have achieved impressive results on various vision tasks, their
performance on chart-to-code generation remains suboptimal. This task requires
MLLMs to generate executable code that can reproduce a given chart, demanding
not only precise visual understanding but also accurate translation of visual
elements into structured code. Directly prompting MLLMs to perform this complex
task often yields unsatisfactory results. To address this challenge, we propose
{ChartIR}, an iterative refinement method based on structured instruction.
First, we distinguish two tasks: visual understanding and code translation. To
accomplish the visual understanding component, we design two types of
structured instructions: description and difference. The description
instruction captures the visual elements of the reference chart, while the
difference instruction characterizes the discrepancies between the reference
chart and the generated chart. These instructions effectively transform visual
features into language representations, thereby facilitating the subsequent
code translation process. Second, we decompose the overall chart generation
pipeline into two stages: initial code generation and iterative refinement,
enabling progressive enhancement of the final output. Experimental results show
that, compared to other method, our method achieves superior performance on
both the open-source model Qwen2-VL and the closed-source model GPT-4o.

Motivation: 在数据稀缺领域，构建图像分类模型困难，传统方法依赖大规模标注数据。ICL为少样本分类提供了新思路，但现有研究忽视了图像嵌入模型的关键作用。

Method: 提出PictSure框架，系统研究不同视觉编码器类型、预训练目标和微调策略对少样本分类性能的影响。

Result: 实验表明，嵌入模型的预训练方式显著影响训练成功率和跨域性能。PictSure在跨域任务中优于现有ICL模型，同时保持域内任务性能。

Conclusion: PictSure通过优化嵌入模型设计，为少样本图像分类提供了更高效的解决方案，尤其在跨域场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Building image classification models remains cumbersome in data-scarce
domains, where collecting large labeled datasets is impractical. In-context
learning (ICL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for few-shot image
classification (FSIC), enabling models to generalize across domains without
gradient-based adaptation. However, prior work has largely overlooked a
critical component of ICL-based FSIC pipelines: the role of image embeddings.
In this work, we present PictSure, an ICL framework that places the embedding
model -- its architecture, pretraining, and training dynamics -- at the center
of analysis. We systematically examine the effects of different visual encoder
types, pretraining objectives, and fine-tuning strategies on downstream FSIC
performance. Our experiments show that the training success and the
out-of-domain performance are highly dependent on how the embedding models are
pretrained. Consequently, PictSure manages to outperform existing ICL-based
FSIC models on out-of-domain benchmarks that differ significantly from the
training distribution, while maintaining comparable results on in-domain tasks.

Motivation: CNN中核大小的选择通常被忽视，但它对模型的感受野、特征提取、计算成本和准确性有重要影响。

Method: BKSEF框架结合信息论、信号处理和学习理论，通过信息增益、计算效率和精度提升的平衡，确定最优核大小。

Result: 实验表明，BKSEF引导的模型在多个数据集上精度提升达3.1%，FLOPs减少42.8%，并在实际应用中验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: BKSEF为CNN设计提供了理论和实践支持，证明核大小是可优化的参数，适用于神经架构搜索和实时系统。

Abstract: Kernel size selection in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is a critical
but often overlooked design decision that affects receptive field, feature
extraction, computational cost, and model accuracy. This paper proposes the
Best Kernel Size Estimation Function (BKSEF), a mathematically grounded and
empirically validated framework for optimal, layer-wise kernel size
determination. BKSEF balances information gain, computational efficiency, and
accuracy improvements by integrating principles from information theory, signal
processing, and learning theory. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
ImageNet-lite, ChestX-ray14, and GTSRB datasets demonstrate that BKSEF-guided
architectures achieve up to 3.1 percent accuracy improvement and 42.8 percent
reduction in FLOPs compared to traditional models using uniform 3x3 kernels.
Two real-world case studies further validate the approach: one for medical
image classification in a cloud-based setup, and another for traffic sign
recognition on edge devices. The former achieved enhanced interpretability and
accuracy, while the latter reduced latency and model size significantly, with
minimal accuracy trade-off. These results show that kernel size can be an
active, optimizable parameter rather than a fixed heuristic. BKSEF provides
practical heuristics and theoretical support for researchers and developers
seeking efficient and application-aware CNN designs. It is suitable for
integration into neural architecture search pipelines and real-time systems,
offering a new perspective on CNN optimization.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于深度学习的零售视频自动标注方法，显著降低成本并保持标注质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统零售视频标注依赖人工，效率低且成本高。

Method: 利用深度神经网络学习特征，结合目标检测技术实现自动标注。

Result: 方法准确性接近人工标注，成本节省2倍，人工仅需验证5%的帧。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且经济，适用于零售领域的多种应用。

Abstract: Accurate video annotation plays a vital role in modern retail applications,
including customer behavior analysis, product interaction detection, and
in-store activity recognition. However, conventional annotation methods heavily
rely on time-consuming manual labeling by human annotators, introducing
non-robust frame selection and increasing operational costs. To address these
challenges in the retail domain, we propose a deep learning-based approach that
automates key-frame identification in retail videos and provides automatic
annotations of products and customers. Our method leverages deep neural
networks to learn discriminative features by embedding video frames and
incorporating object detection-based techniques tailored for retail
environments. Experimental results showcase the superiority of our approach
over traditional methods, achieving accuracy comparable to human annotator
labeling while enhancing the overall efficiency of retail video annotation.
Remarkably, our approach leads to an average of 2 times cost savings in video
annotation. By allowing human annotators to verify/adjust less than 5% of
detected frames in the video dataset, while automating the annotation process
for the remaining frames without reducing annotation quality, retailers can
significantly reduce operational costs. The automation of key-frame detection
enables substantial time and effort savings in retail video labeling tasks,
proving highly valuable for diverse retail applications such as shopper journey
analysis, product interaction detection, and in-store security monitoring.

Conclusion: 该方法在高效性和泛化性上表现优异，适用于新物体类别且无需额外训练。

Abstract: Some perspectives naturally provide more information than others. How can an
AI system determine which viewpoint offers the most valuable insight for
accurate and efficient 3D object reconstruction? Active view selection (AVS)
for 3D reconstruction remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. The
aim is to identify the minimal set of views that yields the most accurate 3D
reconstruction. Instead of learning radiance fields, like NeRF or 3D Gaussian
Splatting, from a current observation and computing uncertainty for each
candidate viewpoint, we introduce a novel AVS approach guided by neural
uncertainty maps predicted by a lightweight feedforward deep neural network,
named UPNet. UPNet takes a single input image of a 3D object and outputs a
predicted uncertainty map, representing uncertainty values across all possible
candidate viewpoints. By leveraging heuristics derived from observing many
natural objects and their associated uncertainty patterns, we train UPNet to
learn a direct mapping from viewpoint appearance to uncertainty in the
underlying volumetric representations. Next, our approach aggregates all
previously predicted neural uncertainty maps to suppress redundant candidate
viewpoints and effectively select the most informative one. Using these
selected viewpoints, we train 3D neural rendering models and evaluate the
quality of novel view synthesis against other competitive AVS methods.
Remarkably, despite using half of the viewpoints than the upper bound, our
method achieves comparable reconstruction accuracy. In addition, it
significantly reduces computational overhead during AVS, achieving up to a 400
times speedup along with over 50\% reductions in CPU, RAM, and GPU usage

TL;DR: 论文提出DPO-Kernels方法，通过混合损失、核化表示和散度选择增强文本到图像模型的对齐性，并引入DETONATE基准和AQI指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像模型在忠实用户意图、安全性和公平性方面的对齐问题。

Method: 结合混合损失（嵌入与概率目标）、核化表示（RBF、多项式、小波核）和散度选择（Wasserstein、Rényi）。

Result: 提出DETONATE基准（10万对图像）和AQI指标，验证DPO-Kernels的泛化性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DPO-Kernels显著提升模型对齐性，公开了DETONATE和代码。

Abstract: Alignment is crucial for text-to-image (T2I) models to ensure that generated
images faithfully capture user intent while maintaining safety and fairness.
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), prominent in large language models
(LLMs), is extending its influence to T2I systems. This paper introduces
DPO-Kernels for T2I models, a novel extension enhancing alignment across three
dimensions: (i) Hybrid Loss, integrating embedding-based objectives with
traditional probability-based loss for improved optimization; (ii) Kernelized
Representations, employing Radial Basis Function (RBF), Polynomial, and Wavelet
kernels for richer feature transformations and better separation between safe
and unsafe inputs; and (iii) Divergence Selection, expanding beyond DPO's
default Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularizer by incorporating Wasserstein and
R'enyi divergences for enhanced stability and robustness. We introduce
DETONATE, the first large-scale benchmark of its kind, comprising approximately
100K curated image pairs categorized as chosen and rejected. DETONATE
encapsulates three axes of social bias and discrimination: Race, Gender, and
Disability. Prompts are sourced from hate speech datasets, with images
generated by leading T2I models including Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, Stable
Diffusion XL, and Midjourney. Additionally, we propose the Alignment Quality
Index (AQI), a novel geometric measure quantifying latent-space separability of
safe/unsafe image activations, revealing hidden vulnerabilities. Empirically,
we demonstrate that DPO-Kernels maintain strong generalization bounds via
Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR). DETONATE and complete code are
publicly released.

Result: 在5个多图像和3个单图像基准测试中，PeRL显著优于现有方法，达到多图像任务的领先性能。

Conclusion: PeRL在多图像任务中表现卓越，同时保持单图像任务的竞争力，为多模态推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Inspired by the impressive reasoning capabilities demonstrated by
reinforcement learning approaches like DeepSeek-R1, recent emerging research
has begun exploring the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance
vision-language models (VLMs) for multimodal reasoning tasks. However, most
existing multimodal reinforcement learning approaches remain limited to spatial
reasoning within single-image contexts, yet still struggle to generalize to
more complex and real-world scenarios involving multi-image positional
reasoning, where understanding the relationships across images is crucial. To
address this challenge, we propose a general reinforcement learning approach
PeRL tailored for interleaved multimodal tasks, and a multi-stage strategy
designed to enhance the exploration-exploitation trade-off, thereby improving
learning efficiency and task performance. Specifically, we introduce
permutation of image sequences to simulate varied positional relationships to
explore more spatial and positional diversity. Furthermore, we design a rollout
filtering mechanism for resampling to focus on trajectories that contribute
most to learning optimal behaviors to exploit learned policies effectively. We
evaluate our model on 5 widely-used multi-image benchmarks and 3 single-image
benchmarks. Our experiments confirm that PeRL trained model consistently
surpasses R1-related and interleaved VLM baselines by a large margin, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on multi-image benchmarks, while preserving
comparable performance on single-image tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在医疗图像等敏感领域的应用引发了隐私问题，现有MIA方法因图像固有难度和高频细节重建困难而效果不佳。

Method: 通过分析反向扩散过程，聚焦中频范围的重建误差，排除高频和低频区域，计算结构相似性指数得分，并与阈值比较确定成员身份。

Result: 实验表明，FCRE方法在多个医疗图像数据集上优于现有MIA方法。

Conclusion: FCRE方法有效解决了医疗图像扩散模型的隐私风险评估问题，为敏感领域提供了更可靠的MIA解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing use of diffusion models for image generation, especially in
sensitive areas like medical imaging, has raised significant privacy concerns.
Membership Inference Attack (MIA) has emerged as a potential approach to
determine if a specific image was used to train a diffusion model, thus
quantifying privacy risks. Existing MIA methods often rely on diffusion
reconstruction errors, where member images are expected to have lower
reconstruction errors than non-member images. However, applying these methods
directly to medical images faces challenges. Reconstruction error is influenced
by inherent image difficulty, and diffusion models struggle with high-frequency
detail reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a
Frequency-Calibrated Reconstruction Error (FCRE) method for MIAs on medical
image diffusion models. By focusing on reconstruction errors within a specific
mid-frequency range and excluding both high-frequency (difficult to
reconstruct) and low-frequency (less informative) regions, our
frequency-selective approach mitigates the confounding factor of inherent image
difficulty. Specifically, we analyze the reverse diffusion process, obtain the
mid-frequency reconstruction error, and compute the structural similarity index
score between the reconstructed and original images. Membership is determined
by comparing this score to a threshold. Experiments on several medical image
datasets demonstrate that our FCRE method outperforms existing MIA methods.

Motivation: 区分夸克和胶子喷注对高能物理研究至关重要，但现有方法（如CNN）在全局上下文建模方面存在局限，ViT的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用模拟的2012年CMS开放数据，构建多通道喷注图像（ECAL、HCAL和重建轨迹），并评估ViT及ViT-CNN混合模型的性能。

Conclusion: ViT架构在喷注分类中表现出色，为未来研究提供了系统框架和性能基准。

Abstract: Distinguishing between quark- and gluon-initiated jets is a critical and
challenging task in high-energy physics, pivotal for improving new physics
searches and precision measurements at the Large Hadron Collider. While deep
learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has advanced jet
tagging using image-based representations, the potential of Vision Transformer
(ViT) architectures, renowned for modeling global contextual information,
remains largely underexplored for direct calorimeter image analysis, especially
under realistic detector and pileup conditions. This paper presents a
systematic evaluation of ViTs and ViT-CNN hybrid models for quark-gluon jet
classification using simulated 2012 CMS Open Data. We construct multi-channel
jet-view images from detector-level energy deposits (ECAL, HCAL) and
reconstructed tracks, enabling an end-to-end learning approach. Our
comprehensive benchmarking demonstrates that ViT-based models, notably
ViT+MaxViT and ViT+ConvNeXt hybrids, consistently outperform established CNN
baselines in F1-score, ROC-AUC, and accuracy, highlighting the advantage of
capturing long-range spatial correlations within jet substructure. This work
establishes the first systematic framework and robust performance baselines for
applying ViT architectures to calorimeter image-based jet classification using
public collider data, alongside a structured dataset suitable for further deep
learning research in this domain.

Result: 模型在多种指标下表现优异，显著优于基线方法，但较硬物体预测更具挑战性。

Conclusion: 提出的模型能有效提升顺应性预测精度，但需进一步研究硬物体的预测问题。

Abstract: Compliance is a critical parameter for describing objects in engineering,
agriculture, and biomedical applications. Traditional compliance detection
methods are limited by their lack of portability and scalability, rely on
specialized, often expensive equipment, and are unsuitable for robotic
applications. Moreover, existing neural network-based approaches using
vision-based tactile sensors still suffer from insufficient prediction
accuracy. In this paper, we propose two models based on Long-term Recurrent
Convolutional Networks (LRCNs) and Transformer architectures that leverage RGB
tactile images and other information captured by the vision-based sensor
GelSight to predict compliance metrics accurately. We validate the performance
of these models using multiple metrics and demonstrate their effectiveness in
accurately estimating compliance. The proposed models exhibit significant
performance improvement over the baseline. Additionally, we investigated the
correlation between sensor compliance and object compliance estimation, which
revealed that objects that are harder than the sensor are more challenging to
estimate.

Motivation: 历史地图中的文本信息具有重要价值，但现有方法难以有效提取，尤其是面对复杂背景和多样化的文本样式。

Result: PALETTE在历史地图数据集上表现优于现有方法，并成功应用于大规模地图标注项目。

Conclusion: PALETTE结合SynthMap+为历史地图文本提取提供了高效解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Text on historical maps contains valuable information providing georeferenced
historical, political, and cultural contexts. However, text extraction from
historical maps is challenging due to the lack of (1) effective methods and (2)
training data. Previous approaches use ad-hoc steps tailored to only specific
map styles. Recent machine learning-based text spotters (e.g., for scene
images) have the potential to solve these challenges because of their
flexibility in supporting various types of text instances. However, these
methods remain challenges in extracting precise image features for predicting
every sub-component (boundary points and characters) in a text instance. This
is critical because map text can be lengthy and highly rotated with complex
backgrounds, posing difficulties in detecting relevant image features from a
rough text region. This paper proposes PALETTE, an end-to-end text spotter for
scanned historical maps of a wide variety. PALETTE introduces a novel
hyper-local sampling module to explicitly learn localized image features around
the target boundary points and characters of a text instance for detection and
recognition. PALETTE also enables hyper-local positional embeddings to learn
spatial interactions between boundary points and characters within and across
text instances. In addition, this paper presents a novel approach to
automatically generate synthetic map images, SynthMap+, for training text
spotters for historical maps. The experiment shows that PALETTE with SynthMap+
outperforms SOTA text spotters on two new benchmark datasets of historical
maps, particularly for long and angled text. We have deployed PALETTE with
SynthMap+ to process over 60,000 maps in the David Rumsey Historical Map
collection and generated over 100 million text labels to support map searching.

Motivation: 解决传统风格迁移方法中的问题，并统一不同任务的框架，实现艺术家级别的风格迁移和文本驱动风格化。

Method: 1. 基于BLIP和CLIP空间的语义风格注入方法；2. 基于人类反馈的数据增强策略；3. 无训练的三重扩散过程，通过自注意力层特征操作实现风格注入。

Result: 实现了高质量的风格迁移和文本驱动风格化，首次在风格迁移过程中实现了图像颜色编辑。

Conclusion: StyleWallfacer框架在风格迁移领域具有革命性意义，能够高效、无漂移地注入风格知识，同时保持对文本的控制。

Abstract: In this pioneering study, we introduce StyleWallfacer, a groundbreaking
unified training and inference framework, which not only addresses various
issues encountered in the style transfer process of traditional methods but
also unifies the framework for different tasks. This framework is designed to
revolutionize the field by enabling artist level style transfer and text driven
stylization. First, we propose a semantic-based style injection method that
uses BLIP to generate text descriptions strictly aligned with the semantics of
the style image in CLIP space. By leveraging a large language model to remove
style-related descriptions from these descriptions, we create a semantic gap.
This gap is then used to fine-tune the model, enabling efficient and drift-free
injection of style knowledge. Second, we propose a data augmentation strategy
based on human feedback, incorporating high-quality samples generated early in
the fine-tuning process into the training set to facilitate progressive
learning and significantly reduce its overfitting. Finally, we design a
training-free triple diffusion process using the fine-tuned model, which
manipulates the features of self-attention layers in a manner similar to the
cross-attention mechanism. Specifically, in the generation process, the key and
value of the content-related process are replaced with those of the
style-related process to inject style while maintaining text control over the
model. We also introduce query preservation to mitigate disruptions to the
original content. Under such a design, we have achieved high-quality
image-driven style transfer and text-driven stylization, delivering
artist-level style transfer results while preserving the original image
content. Moreover, we achieve image color editing during the style transfer
process for the first time.

Result: 实验和理论分析验证了方法的有效性，实现了近100%的码本利用率。

Conclusion: 通过Wasserstein距离对齐分布，显著改善了向量量化的性能。

Abstract: The success of autoregressive models largely depends on the effectiveness of
vector quantization, a technique that discretizes continuous features by
mapping them to the nearest code vectors within a learnable codebook. Two
critical issues in existing vector quantization methods are training
instability and codebook collapse. Training instability arises from the
gradient discrepancy introduced by the straight-through estimator, especially
in the presence of significant quantization errors, while codebook collapse
occurs when only a small subset of code vectors are utilized during training. A
closer examination of these issues reveals that they are primarily driven by a
mismatch between the distributions of the features and code vectors, leading to
unrepresentative code vectors and significant data information loss during
compression. To address this, we employ the Wasserstein distance to align these
two distributions, achieving near 100\% codebook utilization and significantly
reducing the quantization error. Both empirical and theoretical analyses
validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Result: 实验表明SynPo性能接近基于训练的最先进少样本方法。

Conclusion: SynPo通过优化提示选择，显著提升了无训练方法在医学图像分割中的表现。

Abstract: The advent of Large Vision Models (LVMs) offers new opportunities for
few-shot medical image segmentation. However, existing training-free methods
based on LVMs fail to effectively utilize negative prompts, leading to poor
performance on low-contrast medical images. To address this issue, we propose
SynPo, a training-free few-shot method based on LVMs (e.g., SAM), with the core
insight: improving the quality of negative prompts. To select point prompts in
a more reliable confidence map, we design a novel Confidence Map Synergy Module
by combining the strengths of DINOv2 and SAM. Based on the confidence map, we
select the top-k pixels as the positive points set and choose the negative
points set using a Gaussian distribution, followed by independent K-means
clustering for both sets. Then, these selected points are leveraged as
high-quality prompts for SAM to get the segmentation results. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SynPo achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art training-based few-shot methods.

Conclusion: PDSA模块有效解决了点云分析中的问题，实验和可视化结果证明了其合理性和有效性。

Abstract: Point cloud analysis is the cornerstone of many downstream tasks, among which
aggregating local structures is the basis for understanding point cloud data.
While numerous works aggregate neighbor using three-dimensional relative
coordinates, there are irrelevant point interference and feature hierarchy gap
problems due to the limitation of local coordinates. Although some works
address this limitation by refining spatial description though explicit
modeling of cross-stage structure, these enhancement methods based on direct
geometric structure encoding have problems of high computational overhead and
noise sensitivity. To overcome these problems, we propose the Point
Distribution Set Abstraction module (PDSA) that utilizes the correlation in the
high-dimensional space to correct the feature distribution during aggregation,
which improves the computational efficiency and robustness. PDSA distinguishes
the point correlation based on a lightweight cross-stage structural descriptor,
and enhances structural homogeneity by reducing the variance of the neighbor
feature matrix and increasing classes separability though long-distance
modeling. Additionally, we introducing a key point mechanism to optimize the
computational overhead. The experimental result on semantic segmentation and
classification tasks based on different baselines verify the generalization of
the method we proposed, and achieve significant performance improvement with
less parameter cost. The corresponding ablation and visualization results
demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of our method. The code and

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have
revolutionized image processing, demonstrating significant potential in medical
applications. Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle (LV) in
echocardiograms is crucial for diagnostic procedures and necessary treatments.
However, ultrasound images are notoriously noisy with low contrast and
ambiguous LV boundaries, thereby complicating the segmentation process. To
address these challenges, this paper introduces Echo-DND, a novel dual-noise
diffusion model specifically designed for this task. Echo-DND leverages a
unique combination of Gaussian and Bernoulli noises. It also incorporates a
multi-scale fusion conditioning module to improve segmentation precision.
Furthermore, it utilizes spatial coherence calibration to maintain spatial
integrity in segmentation masks. The model's performance was rigorously
validated on the CAMUS and EchoNet-Dynamic datasets. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing SOTA models. It
achieves high Dice scores of 0.962 and 0.939 on these datasets, respectively.
The proposed Echo-DND model establishes a new standard in echocardiogram
segmentation, and its architecture holds promise for broader applicability in
other medical imaging tasks, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy across
various medical domains. Project page: https://abdur75648.github.io/Echo-DND

Result: ReSeDis为多模态搜索系统提供了更全面的测试平台。

Conclusion: ReSeDis为未来研究提供了方向，展示了统一检索与定位的潜力。

Abstract: Large-scale visual search engines are expected to solve a dual problem at
once: (i) locate every image that truly contains the object described by a
sentence and (ii) identify the object's bounding box or exact pixels within
each hit. Existing techniques address only one side of this challenge. Visual
grounding yields tight boxes and masks but rests on the unrealistic assumption
that the object is present in every test image, producing a flood of false
alarms when applied to web-scale collections. Text-to-image retrieval excels at
sifting through massive databases to rank relevant images, yet it stops at
whole-image matches and offers no fine-grained localization. We introduce
Referring Search and Discovery (ReSeDis), the first task that unifies
corpus-level retrieval with pixel-level grounding. Given a free-form
description, a ReSeDis model must decide whether the queried object appears in
each image and, if so, where it is, returning bounding boxes or segmentation
masks. To enable rigorous study, we curate a benchmark in which every
description maps uniquely to object instances scattered across a large, diverse
corpus, eliminating unintended matches. We further design a task-specific
metric that jointly scores retrieval recall and localization precision.
Finally, we provide a straightforward zero-shot baseline using a frozen
vision-language model, revealing significant headroom for future study. ReSeDis
offers a realistic, end-to-end testbed for building the next generation of
robust and scalable multimodal search systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in medical image analysis have led to the development of
highly specialized models tailored to specific clinical tasks. These models
have demonstrated exceptional performance and remain a crucial research
direction. Yet, their applicability is limited to predefined tasks, requiring
expertise and extensive resources for development and adaptation. In contrast,
generalist models offer a different form of utility: allowing medical
practitioners to define tasks on the fly without the need for task-specific
model development. In this work, we explore how to train generalist models for
the domain of retinal optical coherence tomography using visual in-context
learning (VICL), i.e., training models to generalize across tasks based on a
few examples provided at inference time. To facilitate rigorous assessment, we
propose a broad evaluation protocol tailored to VICL in OCT. We extensively
evaluate a state-of-the-art medical VICL approach on multiple retinal OCT
datasets, establishing a first baseline to highlight the potential and current
limitations of in-context learning for OCT. To foster further research and
practical adoption, we openly release our code.

Motivation: 随着视觉语言预训练模型语义理解能力的提升，公开图像容易被搜索引擎等工具利用，需保护用户隐私。

Result: 实验证明PSIC在多种下游任务中有效保护隐私并保持图像质量。

Conclusion: PSIC是一种即插即用的方法，可集成到现有图像压缩模型中，有效平衡隐私保护与图像质量。

Abstract: The improved semantic understanding of vision-language pretrained (VLP)
models has made it increasingly difficult to protect publicly posted images
from being exploited by search engines and other similar tools. In this
context, this paper seeks to protect users' privacy by implementing defenses at
the image compression stage to prevent exploitation. Specifically, we propose a
flexible coding method, termed Privacy-Shielded Image Compression (PSIC), that
can produce bitstreams with multiple decoding options. By default, the
bitstream is decoded to preserve satisfactory perceptual quality while
preventing interpretation by VLP models. Our method also retains the original
image compression functionality. With a customizable input condition, the
proposed scheme can reconstruct the image that preserves its full semantic
information. A Conditional Latent Trigger Generation (CLTG) module is proposed
to produce bias information based on customizable conditions to guide the
decoding process into different reconstructed versions, and an
Uncertainty-Aware Encryption-Oriented (UAEO) optimization function is designed
to leverage the soft labels inferred from the target VLP model's uncertainty on
the training data. This paper further incorporates an adaptive multi-objective
optimization strategy to obtain improved encrypting performance and perceptual
quality simultaneously within a unified training process. The proposed scheme
is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly integrated into most existing Learned
Image Compression (LIC) models. Extensive experiments across multiple

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于两阶段扩散模型的融合网络（DM-FNet），用于多模态医学图像融合（MMIF），通过增强特征识别能力和自适应处理不同模态图像，显著提升了融合图像的质量和信息密度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MMIF方法在传统训练中难以捕捉细节特征，且跨模态特征交互不足，导致融合图像质量不佳。

Method: 采用两阶段扩散模型：第一阶段训练UNet进行图像重建，第二阶段将不同步骤的噪声图像输入融合网络，结合三个关键融合模块自适应处理多模态图像。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在客观评价指标上表现优异，融合图像保留了适当的亮度、放射性示踪剂分布、丰富纹理和清晰边缘。

Conclusion: DM-FNet通过创新的网络结构和混合损失函数，有效提升了多模态医学图像融合的质量和信息密度。

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion (MMIF) extracts the most meaningful
information from multiple source images, enabling a more comprehensive and
accurate diagnosis. Achieving high-quality fusion results requires a careful
balance of brightness, color, contrast, and detail; this ensures that the fused
images effectively display relevant anatomical structures and reflect the
functional status of the tissues. However, existing MMIF methods have limited
capacity to capture detailed features during conventional training and suffer
from insufficient cross-modal feature interaction, leading to suboptimal fused
image quality. To address these issues, this study proposes a two-stage
diffusion model-based fusion network (DM-FNet) to achieve unified MMIF. In
Stage I, a diffusion process trains UNet for image reconstruction. UNet
captures detailed information through progressive denoising and represents
multilevel data, providing a rich set of feature representations for the
subsequent fusion network. In Stage II, noisy images at various steps are input
into the fusion network to enhance the model's feature recognition capability.
Three key fusion modules are also integrated to process medical images from
different modalities adaptively. Ultimately, the robust network structure and a
hybrid loss function are integrated to harmonize the fused image's brightness,
color, contrast, and detail, enhancing its quality and information density. The
experimental results across various medical image types demonstrate that the
proposed method performs exceptionally well regarding objective evaluation
metrics. The fused image preserves appropriate brightness, a comprehensive
distribution of radioactive tracers, rich textures, and clear edges. The code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RaCalNet提出了一种无需密集监督的毫米波雷达深度估计方法，通过稀疏LiDAR监督实现高精度深度预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖密集LiDAR监督，成本高且数据密集。RaCalNet旨在减少监督需求，同时保持精度。

Method: 通过稀疏雷达点校准和优化构建深度先验，引导单目深度预测，避免密集监督。

Result: 在ZJU-4DRadarCam数据集上，RMSE降低35.30%和34.89%，优于现有密集监督方法。

Conclusion: RaCalNet证明了稀疏监督的可行性，显著提升了深度估计的精度和效率。

Abstract: Dense metric depth estimation using millimeter-wave radar typically requires
dense LiDAR supervision, generated via multi-frame projection and
interpolation, to guide the learning of accurate depth from sparse radar
measurements and RGB images. However, this paradigm is both costly and
data-intensive. To address this, we propose RaCalNet, a novel framework that
eliminates the need for dense supervision by using sparse LiDAR to supervise
the learning of refined radar measurements, resulting in a supervision density
of merely around 1% compared to dense-supervised methods. Unlike previous
approaches that associate radar points with broad image regions and rely
heavily on dense labels, RaCalNet first recalibrates and refines sparse radar
points to construct accurate depth priors. These priors then serve as reliable
anchors to guide monocular depth prediction, enabling metric-scale estimation
without resorting to dense supervision. This design improves structural
consistency and preserves fine details. Despite relying solely on sparse
supervision, RaCalNet surpasses state-of-the-art dense-supervised methods,
producing depth maps with clear object contours and fine-grained textures.
Extensive experiments on the ZJU-4DRadarCam dataset and real-world deployment
scenarios demonstrate its effectiveness, reducing RMSE by 35.30% and 34.89%,
respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR船舶检测面临多尺度变化、小目标噪声和复杂背景等挑战，需要提升检测精度和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出C-AFBiFPN框架，包括卷积特征增强模块（CFE）和创新的AFBiFPN网络，结合BiFormer注意力机制优化特征融合。

Result: 在SSDD数据集上，该方法显著提升了小目标检测精度、抗遮挡能力和多尺度适应性。

Conclusion: C-AFBiFPN框架有效解决了SAR船舶检测中的关键问题，提升了整体性能。

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) enables submeter-resolution imaging and
all-weather monitoring via active microwave and advanced signal processing.
Currently, SAR has found extensive applications in critical maritime domains
such as ship detection. However, SAR ship detection faces several challenges,
including significant scale variations among ships, the presence of small
offshore vessels mixed with noise, and complex backgrounds for large nearshore
ships. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel feature enhancement
and fusion framework named C-AFBiFPN. C-AFBiFPN constructs a Convolutional
Feature Enhancement (CFE) module following the backbone network, aiming to
enrich feature representation and enhance the ability to capture and represent
local details and contextual information. Furthermore, C-AFBiFPN innovatively
integrates BiFormer attention within the fusion strategy of BiFPN, creating the
AFBiFPN network. AFBiFPN improves the global modeling capability of cross-scale
feature fusion and can adaptively focus on critical feature regions. The
experimental results on SAR Ship Detection Dataset (SSDD) indicate that the
proposed approach substantially enhances detection accuracy for small targets,
robustness against occlusions, and adaptability to multi-scale features.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的基准测试，用于评估大型视觉语言模型在长期记忆和推理任务中的表现，特别是在机器人控制领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在处理长期记忆和大量图像时表现不佳，且缺乏针对具体机器人任务的评估标准。

Method: 在Habitat模拟器中设计了一个包含60个任务的基准测试，这些任务需要长期记忆和上下文感知能力。

Result: 提出了基线模型，结合了先进的视觉语言模型和低级导航策略，并评估了它们在记忆密集型任务中的表现。

Conclusion: 该基准测试为未来研究提供了可扩展的评估工具，并指出了改进方向。

Abstract: Large vision-language models have recently demonstrated impressive
performance in planning and control tasks, driving interest in their
application to real-world robotics. However, deploying these models for
reasoning in embodied contexts is limited by their ability to incorporate
long-term experience collected across multiple days and represented by vast
collections of images. Current VLMs typically struggle to process more than a
few hundred images concurrently, highlighting the need for more efficient
mechanisms to handle long-term memory in embodied settings. To effectively
evaluate these models for long-horizon control, a benchmark must specifically
target scenarios where memory is crucial for success. Existing long-video QA
benchmarks overlook embodied challenges like object manipulation and
navigation, which demand low-level skills and fine-grained reasoning over past
interactions. Moreover, effective memory integration in embodied agents
involves both recalling relevant historical information and executing actions
based on that information, making it essential to study these aspects together
rather than in isolation. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark for
long-range embodied tasks in the Habitat simulator. This benchmark evaluates
memory-based capabilities across 60 tasks requiring sustained engagement and
contextual awareness in an environment. The tasks can also be procedurally
extended to longer and more challenging versions, enabling scalable evaluation
of memory and reasoning. We also present baselines that integrate
state-of-the-art VLMs with low level navigation policies, assessing their
performance on these memory-intensive tasks and highlight areas for
improvement.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖精确相机位姿先验，在复杂轨迹下表现不佳，需要更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 采用增量式流程，结合NeRF的光度一致性和流驱动位姿调节，引入隐式位姿滤波器消除噪声。

Result: 在Tanks&Temple和NeRFBuster数据集上，RA-NeRF在位姿估计和视觉质量上达到最优。

Conclusion: RA-NeRF在复杂相机轨迹下表现出高效性和鲁棒性，为场景重建提供了新思路。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have emerged
as powerful tools for 3D reconstruction and SLAM tasks. However, their
performance depends heavily on accurate camera pose priors. Existing approaches
attempt to address this issue by introducing external constraints but fall
short of achieving satisfactory accuracy, particularly when camera trajectories
are complex. In this paper, we propose a novel method, RA-NeRF, capable of
predicting highly accurate camera poses even with complex camera trajectories.
Following the incremental pipeline, RA-NeRF reconstructs the scene using NeRF
with photometric consistency and incorporates flow-driven pose regulation to
enhance robustness during initialization and localization. Additionally,
RA-NeRF employs an implicit pose filter to capture the camera movement pattern
and eliminate the noise for pose estimation. To validate our method, we conduct
extensive experiments on the Tanks\&Temple dataset for standard evaluation, as
well as the NeRFBuster dataset, which presents challenging camera pose
trajectories. On both datasets, RA-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art results in
both camera pose estimation and visual quality, demonstrating its effectiveness
and robustness in scene reconstruction under complex pose trajectories.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RetroMem的回忆增强COD架构，通过整合历史知识动态调制伪装模式感知与推理，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏获取历史背景的机制，限制了其在复杂伪装场景中的适应性和有效性。

Method: 采用两阶段训练范式（学习阶段和回忆阶段），设计了密集多尺度适配器（DMA）和动态记忆机制（DMM）及推理模式重建（IPR）。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，RetroMem显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: RetroMem通过动态整合历史知识，有效提升了伪装场景的理解能力。

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) primarily focuses on learning subtle yet
discriminative representations from complex scenes. Existing methods
predominantly follow the parametric feedforward architecture based on static
visual representation modeling. However, they lack explicit mechanisms for
acquiring historical context, limiting their adaptation and effectiveness in
handling challenging camouflage scenes. In this paper, we propose a
recall-augmented COD architecture, namely RetroMem, which dynamically modulates
camouflage pattern perception and inference by integrating relevant historical
knowledge into the process. Specifically, RetroMem employs a two-stage training
paradigm consisting of a learning stage and a recall stage to construct,
update, and utilize memory representations effectively. During the learning
stage, we design a dense multi-scale adapter (DMA) to improve the pretrained
encoder's capability to capture rich multi-scale visual information with very
few trainable parameters, thereby providing foundational inferences. In the
recall stage, we propose a dynamic memory mechanism (DMM) and an inference
pattern reconstruction (IPR). These components fully leverage the latent
relationships between learned knowledge and current sample context to
reconstruct the inference of camouflage patterns, thereby significantly
improving the model's understanding of camouflage scenes. Extensive experiments
on several widely used datasets demonstrate that our RetroMem significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: DBACS方法显著提升了DA技术在半导体领域的应用效果，减少了资源消耗并提高了效率。

Abstract: In the semiconductor sector, due to high demand but also strong and
increasing competition, time to market and quality are key factors in securing
significant market share in various application areas. Thanks to the success of
deep learning methods in recent years in the computer vision domain, Industry
4.0 and 5.0 applications, such as defect classification, have achieved
remarkable success. In particular, Domain Adaptation (DA) has proven highly
effective since it focuses on using the knowledge learned on a (source) domain
to adapt and perform effectively on a different but related (target) domain. By
improving robustness and scalability, DA minimizes the need for extensive
manual re-labeling or re-training of models. This not only reduces
computational and resource costs but also allows human experts to focus on
high-value tasks. Therefore, we tested the efficacy of DA techniques in
semi-supervised and unsupervised settings within the context of the
semiconductor field. Moreover, we propose the DBACS approach, a
CycleGAN-inspired model enhanced with additional loss terms to improve
performance. All the approaches are studied and validated on real-world
Electron Microscope images considering the unsupervised and semi-supervised
settings, proving the usefulness of our method in advancing DA techniques for
the semiconductor field.

Motivation: 现有INR方法在细节密集和快速变化视频内容上表现不佳，主要原因是网络特征利用不足和缺乏视频特定设计。

Method: 采用多尺度特征融合框架，包括时间窗口增强时间一致性、GoP级网格背景表示、多尺度空间解码器和尺度自适应损失函数。

Result: 在HEVC ClassB和UVG数据集上，MSNeRV在表示能力和压缩效率上优于现有INR方法，并超越VTM-23.7。

Conclusion: MSNeRV通过多尺度特征融合和视频特定设计，显著提升了神经视频表示的性能和压缩效率。

Abstract: Implicit Neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a promising approach
for video compression, and have achieved comparable performance to the
state-of-the-art codecs such as H.266/VVC. However, existing INR-based methods
struggle to effectively represent detail-intensive and fast-changing video
content. This limitation mainly stems from the underutilization of internal
network features and the absence of video-specific considerations in network
design. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-scale feature fusion
framework, MSNeRV, for neural video representation. In the encoding stage, we
enhance temporal consistency by employing temporal windows, and divide the
video into multiple Groups of Pictures (GoPs), where a GoP-level grid is used
for background representation. Additionally, we design a multi-scale spatial
decoder with a scale-adaptive loss function to integrate multi-resolution and
multi-frequency information. To further improve feature extraction, we
introduce a multi-scale feature block that fully leverages hidden features. We
evaluate MSNeRV on HEVC ClassB and UVG datasets for video representation and
compression. Experimental results demonstrate that our model exhibits superior
representation capability among INR-based approaches and surpasses VTM-23.7
(Random Access) in dynamic scenarios in terms of compression efficiency.

Abstract: Laparoscopic liver surgery, while minimally invasive, poses significant
challenges in accurately identifying critical anatomical structures. Augmented
reality (AR) systems, integrating MRI/CT with laparoscopic images based on
2D-3D registration, offer a promising solution for enhancing surgical
navigation. A vital aspect of the registration progress is the precise
detection of curvilinear anatomical landmarks in laparoscopic images. In this
paper, we propose BCRNet (Bezier Curve Refinement Net), a novel framework that
significantly enhances landmark detection in laparoscopic liver surgery
primarily via the Bezier curve refinement strategy. The framework starts with a
Multi-modal Feature Extraction (MFE) module designed to robustly capture
semantic features. Then we propose Adaptive Curve Proposal Initialization
(ACPI) to generate pixel-aligned Bezier curves and confidence scores for
reliable initial proposals. Additionally, we design the Hierarchical Curve
Refinement (HCR) mechanism to enhance these proposals iteratively through a
multi-stage process, capturing fine-grained contextual details from multi-scale
pixel-level features for precise Bezier curve adjustment. Extensive evaluations
on the L3D and P2ILF datasets demonstrate that BCRNet outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant performance improvements. Code

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary movements of the face that
occur spontaneously when a person experiences an emotion but attempts to
suppress or repress the facial expression, typically found in a high-stakes
environment. In recent years, substantial advancements have been made in the
areas of ME recognition, spotting, and generation. However, conventional
approaches that treat spotting and recognition as separate tasks are
suboptimal, particularly for analyzing long-duration videos in realistic
settings. Concurrently, the emergence of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) offers promising new avenues
for enhancing ME analysis through their powerful multimodal reasoning
capabilities. The ME grand challenge (MEGC) 2025 introduces two tasks that
reflect these evolving research directions: (1) ME spot-then-recognize
(ME-STR), which integrates ME spotting and subsequent recognition in a unified
sequential pipeline; and (2) ME visual question answering (ME-VQA), which
explores ME understanding through visual question answering, leveraging MLLMs
or LVLMs to address diverse question types related to MEs. All participating

Abstract: Pathology image classification plays a crucial role in accurate medical
diagnosis and treatment planning. Training high-performance models for this
task typically requires large-scale annotated datasets, which are both
expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Active Learning (AL) offers a solution
by iteratively selecting the most informative samples for annotation, thereby
reducing the labeling effort. However, most AL methods are designed under the
assumption of a closed-set scenario, where all the unannotated images belong to
target classes. In real-world clinical environments, the unlabeled pool often
contains a substantial amount of Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data, leading to low
efficiency of annotation in traditional AL methods. Furthermore, most existing
AL methods start with random selection in the first query round, leading to a
significant waste of labeling costs in open-set scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose OpenPath, a novel open-set active learning approach for
pathological image classification leveraging a pre-trained Vision-Language
Model (VLM). In the first query, we propose task-specific prompts that combine
target and relevant non-target class prompts to effectively select
In-Distribution (ID) and informative samples from the unlabeled pool. In
subsequent queries, Diverse Informative ID Sampling (DIS) that includes
Prototype-based ID candidate Selection (PIS) and Entropy-Guided Stochastic
Sampling (EGSS) is proposed to ensure both purity and informativeness in a
query, avoiding the selection of OOD samples. Experiments on two public
pathology image datasets show that OpenPath significantly enhances the model's
performance due to its high purity of selected samples, and outperforms several
state-of-the-art open-set AL methods. The code is available at

Abstract: We introduce a new task of open-world object counting in videos: given a text
description, or an image example, that specifies the target object, the
objective is to enumerate all the unique instances of the target objects in the
video. This task is especially challenging in crowded scenes with occlusions
and similar objects, where avoiding double counting and identifying
reappearances is crucial. To this end, we make the following contributions: we
introduce a model, CountVid, for this task. It leverages an image-based
counting model, and a promptable video segmentation and tracking model to
enable automated, open-world object counting across video frames. To evaluate
its performance, we introduce VideoCount, a new dataset for our novel task
built from the TAO and MOT20 tracking datasets, as well as from videos of
penguins and metal alloy crystallization captured by x-rays. Using this
dataset, we demonstrate that CountVid provides accurate object counts, and
significantly outperforms strong baselines. The VideoCount dataset, the
CountVid model, and all the code are available at

unique markings found on an animal's skin or fur, into a canonical UV space,
enabling more robust feature matching. Our method uses surface normal
estimation to guide the unwrapping process while preserving the geometric
consistency between the 3D surface and the 2D texture space. We focus on two
challenging species: Saimaa ringed seals (Pusa hispida saimensis) and leopards
(Panthera pardus). Both species have distinctive yet highly deformable fur
patterns. By integrating our pattern-preserving UV mapping with existing
re-identification techniques, we demonstrate improved accuracy across diverse
poses and viewing angles. Our framework does not require ground truth UV
annotations and can be trained in a self-supervised manner. Experiments on seal
and leopard datasets show up to a 5.4% improvement in re-identification
accuracy.

TL;DR: DDIS是一种基于扩散模型的数据无关图像合成方法，通过引入领域对齐指导和类别对齐标记，显著提升了合成图像的质量和与训练数据分布的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源预训练模型在训练数据不可用时效用下降，现有数据无关图像合成方法因缺乏自然图像先验知识导致合成样本偏离训练数据分布。

Method: 提出DDIS方法，利用文本到图像扩散模型作为图像先验，结合领域对齐指导（DAG）和类别对齐标记（CAT）优化合成过程。

Result: 在PACS和ImageNet上的实验表明，DDIS优于现有方法，生成更符合训练数据分布的样本，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: DDIS通过结合扩散模型和领域对齐技术，显著提升了数据无关图像合成的质量，为相关应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Open-source pre-trained models hold great potential for diverse applications,
but their utility declines when their training data is unavailable. Data-Free
Image Synthesis (DFIS) aims to generate images that approximate the learned
data distribution of a pre-trained model without accessing the original data.
However, existing DFIS meth ods produce samples that deviate from the training
data distribution due to the lack of prior knowl edge about natural images. To
overcome this limitation, we propose DDIS, the first Diffusion-assisted
Data-free Image Synthesis method that leverages a text-to-image diffusion model
as a powerful image prior, improving synthetic image quality. DDIS extracts
knowledge about the learned distribution from the given model and uses it to
guide the diffusion model, enabling the generation of images that accurately
align with the training data distribution. To achieve this, we introduce Domain
Alignment Guidance (DAG) that aligns the synthetic data domain with the
training data domain during the diffusion sampling process. Furthermore, we
optimize a single Class Alignment Token (CAT) embedding to effectively capture
class-specific attributes in the training dataset. Experiments on PACS and Ima
geNet demonstrate that DDIS outperforms prior DFIS methods by generating
samples that better reflect the training data distribution, achieving SOTA
performance in data-free applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为NERO的新型OOD评分机制，通过神经元级相关性增强OOD检测能力，并在医学影像数据上验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学影像领域，确保深度学习模型的可靠性至关重要，尤其是检测OOD样本以避免潜在诊断错误。现有方法未能充分捕捉OOD多样性，因此需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: NERO利用特征层的神经元级相关性，聚类形成代表性中心，并引入相关性距离度量样本与中心的偏差。同时结合缩放相关性和特征范数优化性能。

Result: 在胃肠道影像基准测试中，NERO优于现有OOD检测方法，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: NERO通过神经元级相关性和可解释性设计，显著提升了OOD检测能力，为医学影像的可靠性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Ensuring reliability is paramount in deep learning, particularly within the
domain of medical imaging, where diagnostic decisions often hinge on model
outputs. The capacity to separate out-of-distribution (OOD) samples has proven
to be a valuable indicator of a model's reliability in research. In medical
imaging, this is especially critical, as identifying OOD inputs can help flag
potential anomalies that might otherwise go undetected. While many OOD
detection methods rely on feature or logit space representations, recent works
suggest these approaches may not fully capture OOD diversity. To address this,
we propose a novel OOD scoring mechanism, called NERO, that leverages
neuron-level relevance at the feature layer. Specifically, we cluster
neuron-level relevance for each in-distribution (ID) class to form
representative centroids and introduce a relevance distance metric to quantify
a new sample's deviation from these centroids, enhancing OOD separability.
Additionally, we refine performance by incorporating scaled relevance in the
bias term and combining feature norms. Our framework also enables explainable
OOD detection. We validate its effectiveness across multiple deep learning
architectures on the gastrointestinal imaging benchmarks Kvasir and
GastroVision, achieving improvements over state-of-the-art OOD detection
methods.

Motivation: 由于缺乏大规模4D人-物交互数据集，现有方法难以实现高质量的4D HOI合成。

Method: 第一阶段使用Object-AnchorNet从3D HOI数据集中重建稀疏3D关键帧；第二阶段通过Contact-Aware Diffusion Model（ContactDM）插值生成密集4D序列。

Result: 在OMOMO和3D-FUTURE数据集上取得了最先进的结果，展示了强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: GenHOI框架有效减少了对大规模4D数据集的依赖，同时实现了高质量的4D HOI生成。

Abstract: While diffusion models and large-scale motion datasets have advanced
text-driven human motion synthesis, extending these advances to 4D human-object
interaction (HOI) remains challenging, mainly due to the limited availability
of large-scale 4D HOI datasets. In our study, we introduce GenHOI, a novel
two-stage framework aimed at achieving two key objectives: 1) generalization to
unseen objects and 2) the synthesis of high-fidelity 4D HOI sequences. In the
initial stage of our framework, we employ an Object-AnchorNet to reconstruct
sparse 3D HOI keyframes for unseen objects, learning solely from 3D HOI
datasets, thereby mitigating the dependence on large-scale 4D HOI datasets.
Subsequently, we introduce a Contact-Aware Diffusion Model (ContactDM) in the
second stage to seamlessly interpolate sparse 3D HOI keyframes into densely
temporally coherent 4D HOI sequences. To enhance the quality of generated 4D
HOI sequences, we propose a novel Contact-Aware Encoder within ContactDM to
extract human-object contact patterns and a novel Contact-Aware HOI Attention
to effectively integrate the contact signals into diffusion models.
Experimental results show that we achieve state-of-the-art results on the
publicly available OMOMO and 3D-FUTURE datasets, demonstrating strong
generalization abilities to unseen objects, while enabling high-fidelity 4D HOI
generation.

Conclusion: CLAIM为心肌瘢痕合成与分割提供了可控且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning-based myocardial scar segmentation from late gadolinium
enhancement (LGE) cardiac MRI has shown great potential for accurate and timely
diagnosis and treatment planning for structural cardiac diseases. However, the
limited availability and variability of LGE images with high-quality scar
labels restrict the development of robust segmentation models. To address this,
we introduce CLAIM: \textbf{C}linically-Guided \textbf{L}GE
\textbf{A}ugmentation for Real\textbf{i}stic and Diverse \textbf{M}yocardial
Scar Synthesis and Segmentation framework, a framework for anatomically
grounded scar generation and segmentation. At its core is the SMILE module
(Scar Mask generation guided by cLinical knowledgE), which conditions a
diffusion-based generator on the clinically adopted AHA 17-segment model to
synthesize images with anatomically consistent and spatially diverse scar
patterns. In addition, CLAIM employs a joint training strategy in which the
scar segmentation network is optimized alongside the generator, aiming to
enhance both the realism of synthesized scars and the accuracy of the scar
segmentation performance. Experimental results show that CLAIM produces
anatomically coherent scar patterns and achieves higher Dice similarity with
real scar distributions compared to baseline models. Our approach enables
controllable and realistic myocardial scar synthesis and has demonstrated
utility for downstream medical imaging task.

Motivation: 现有基于预训练文本到图像扩散模型的方法在布局控制上存在定位不准和伪影问题，WinWinLay旨在解决这些缺陷。

Method: 提出非局部注意力能量函数以消除空间分布偏差，并引入基于Langevin动力学的自适应更新规则以保持预训练域内更新。

Result: WinWinLay在元素布局控制和视觉逼真度上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: WinWinLay通过两种策略显著提升了布局到图像生成的精度和真实性。

Abstract: Layout-to-Image generation aims to create complex scenes with precise control
over the placement and arrangement of subjects. Existing works have
demonstrated that pre-trained Text-to-Image diffusion models can achieve this
goal without training on any specific data; however, they often face challenges
with imprecise localization and unrealistic artifacts. Focusing on these
drawbacks, we propose a novel training-free method, WinWinLay. At its core,
WinWinLay presents two key strategies, Non-local Attention Energy Function and
Adaptive Update, that collaboratively enhance control precision and realism. On
one hand, we theoretically demonstrate that the commonly used attention energy
function introduces inherent spatial distribution biases, hindering objects
from being uniformly aligned with layout instructions. To overcome this issue,
non-local attention prior is explored to redistribute attention scores,
facilitating objects to better conform to the specified spatial conditions. On
the other hand, we identify that the vanilla backpropagation update rule can
cause deviations from the pre-trained domain, leading to out-of-distribution
artifacts. We accordingly introduce a Langevin dynamics-based adaptive update
scheme as a remedy that promotes in-domain updating while respecting layout
constraints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WinWinLay excels in
controlling element placement and achieving photorealistic visual fidelity,
outperforming the current state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 超高空间分辨率土地覆盖分类面临像素级标注成本高、尺度变化大和大规模视觉模型适应性有限的问题。

Method: 采用半监督分割框架，结合SAM2知识和FreqWeaver适配器，仅占模型总参数的5.96%。

Result: 在未标注数据的有效利用和低参数开销下，实现了结构一致性更强的分割结果，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在0.3米分辨率影像上表现出色，为高分辨率遥感分割提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Ultra-high Spatial Resolution Land Cover Classification is essential for
fine-grained land cover analysis, yet it remains challenging due to the high
cost of pixel-level annotations, significant scale variation, and the limited
adaptability of large-scale vision models. Existing methods typically focus on
1-meter spatial resolution imagery and rely heavily on annotated data, whereas
practical applications often require processing higher-resolution imagery under
weak supervision. To address this, we propose a parameter-efficient
semi-supervised segmentation framework for 0.3 m spatial resolution imagery,
which leverages the knowledge of SAM2 and introduces a remote sensing-specific
FreqWeaver Adapter to enhance fine-grained detail modeling while maintaining a
lightweight design at only 5.96% of the total model parameters. By effectively
leveraging unlabeled data and maintaining minimal parameter overhead, the
proposed method delivers robust segmentation results with superior structural
consistency, achieving a 1.78% improvement over existing parameter-efficient
tuning strategies and a 3.44% gain compared to state-of-the-art high-resolution

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模非破坏性AGB估计提供了可行解决方案，并推动了无人机激光扫描（ULS）的广泛应用。

Abstract: Estimating forest above-ground biomass (AGB) is crucial for assessing carbon
storage and supporting sustainable forest management. Quantitative Structural
Model (QSM) offers a non-destructive approach to AGB estimation through 3D tree
structural reconstruction. However, current QSM methods face significant
limitations, as they are primarily designed for individual trees,depend on
high-quality point cloud data from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), and also
require multiple pre-processing steps that hinder scalability and practical
deployment. This study presents a novel unified framework that enables
end-to-end processing of large-scale point clouds using an innovative
graph-based pipeline. The proposed approach seamlessly integrates tree
segmentation,leaf-wood separation and 3D skeletal reconstruction through
dedicated graph operations including pathing and abstracting for tree topology
reasoning. Comprehensive validation was conducted on datasets with varying leaf
conditions (leaf-on and leaf-off), spatial scales (tree- and plot-level), and
data sources (TLS and UAV-based laser scanning, ULS). Experimental results
demonstrate strong performance under challenging conditions, particularly in
leaf-on scenarios (~20% relative error) and low-density ULS datasets with
partial coverage (~30% relative error). These findings indicate that the
proposed framework provides a robust and scalable solution for large-scale,
non-destructive AGB estimation. It significantly reduces dependency on
specialized pre-processing tools and establishes ULS as a viable alternative to
TLS. To our knowledge, this is the first method capable of enabling seamless,
end-to-end 3D tree reconstruction at operational scales. This advancement
substantially improves the feasibility of QSM-based AGB estimation, paving the
way for broader applications in forest inventory and climate change research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于稳定扩散（SD）的Real-VSR方法在时间一致性上牺牲了空间细节，导致视觉质量不佳。

Method: 通过交叉帧检索（CFR）模块和一致性-LoRA（C-LoRA）模块提取时间一致性先验，再训练细节-LoRA（D-LoRA）增强空间细节，交替优化。

Result: DLoRAL在单步扩散中实现了高质量的细节和时间一致性，实验表明其在准确性和速度上表现优异。

Conclusion: DLoRAL通过双LoRA学习范式，有效解决了Real-VSR中细节与一致性的平衡问题。

Abstract: It is a challenging problem to reproduce rich spatial details while
maintaining temporal consistency in real-world video super-resolution
(Real-VSR), especially when we leverage pre-trained generative models such as
stable diffusion (SD) for realistic details synthesis. Existing SD-based
Real-VSR methods often compromise spatial details for temporal coherence,
resulting in suboptimal visual quality. We argue that the key lies in how to
effectively extract the degradation-robust temporal consistency priors from the
low-quality (LQ) input video and enhance the video details while maintaining
the extracted consistency priors. To achieve this, we propose a Dual LoRA
Learning (DLoRAL) paradigm to train an effective SD-based one-step diffusion
model, achieving realistic frame details and temporal consistency
simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a Cross-Frame Retrieval (CFR) module
to aggregate complementary information across frames, and train a
Consistency-LoRA (C-LoRA) to learn robust temporal representations from
degraded inputs. After consistency learning, we fix the CFR and C-LoRA modules
and train a Detail-LoRA (D-LoRA) to enhance spatial details while aligning with
the temporal space defined by C-LoRA to keep temporal coherence. The two phases
alternate iteratively for optimization, collaboratively delivering consistent
and detail-rich outputs. During inference, the two LoRA branches are merged
into the SD model, allowing efficient and high-quality video restoration in a
single diffusion step. Experiments show that DLoRAL achieves strong performance
in both accuracy and speed. Code and models are available at

TL;DR: M2M-Reg提出了一种新的多模态图像配准框架，通过单模态相似性训练模型，解决了传统方法在多模态配准中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于多模态图像（如PET和FA）与结构参考（如MRI）的异质性，传统无监督配准方法难以学习可靠的空间映射，导致图像失真。

Method: 提出M2M-Reg框架，利用单模态相似性训练多模态配准模型，并引入GradCyCon正则化器促进微分同胚。框架还支持半监督学习。

Result: 在ADNI数据集上，M2M-Reg在PET-MRI和FA-MRI配准中的DSC指标比现有方法提高了2倍。

Conclusion: M2M-Reg有效解决了高度异质多模态配准问题，且无需真实变换或分割掩码，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: In clinical practice, imaging modalities with functional characteristics,
such as positron emission tomography (PET) and fractional anisotropy (FA), are
often aligned with a structural reference (e.g., MRI, CT) for accurate
interpretation or group analysis, necessitating multi-modal deformable image
registration (DIR). However, due to the extreme heterogeneity of these
modalities compared to standard structural scans, conventional unsupervised DIR
methods struggle to learn reliable spatial mappings and often distort images.
We find that the similarity metrics guiding these models fail to capture
alignment between highly disparate modalities. To address this, we propose
M2M-Reg (Multi-to-Mono Registration), a novel framework that trains multi-modal
DIR models using only mono-modal similarity while preserving the established
architectural paradigm for seamless integration into existing models. We also
introduce GradCyCon, a regularizer that leverages M2M-Reg's cyclic training
scheme to promote diffeomorphism. Furthermore, our framework naturally extends
to a semi-supervised setting, integrating pre-aligned and unaligned pairs only,
without requiring ground-truth transformations or segmentation masks.
Experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset
demonstrate that M2M-Reg achieves up to 2x higher DSC than prior methods for
PET-MRI and FA-MRI registration, highlighting its effectiveness in handling
highly heterogeneous multi-modal DIR. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D目标检测方法依赖密集点云重建，计算和内存开销大，难以实时部署。

Method: 使用Cubify Anything和CLIP进行单视图检测，通过关联模块和优化模块融合多视图检测结果。

Result: 在ScanNetV2和CA-1M数据集上达到在线方法的SOTA性能，支持超1000平方米环境的实时感知。

Conclusion: 无需重建的框架具有高效性和泛化能力，适用于实时3D目标检测。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D object detection has gained significant interest due to
its critical applications in autonomous driving and embodied AI. Existing
detection methods, whether offline or online, typically rely on dense point
cloud reconstruction, which imposes substantial computational overhead and
memory constraints, hindering real-time deployment in downstream tasks. To
address this, we propose a novel reconstruction-free online framework tailored
for memory-efficient and real-time 3D detection. Specifically, given streaming
posed RGB-D video input, we leverage Cubify Anything as a pre-trained visual
foundation model (VFM) for single-view 3D object detection by bounding boxes,
coupled with CLIP to capture open-vocabulary semantics of detected objects. To
fuse all detected bounding boxes across different views into a unified one, we
employ an association module for correspondences of multi-views and an
optimization module to fuse the 3D bounding boxes of the same instance
predicted in multi-views. The association module utilizes 3D Non-Maximum
Suppression (NMS) and a box correspondence matching module, while the
optimization module uses an IoU-guided efficient random optimization technique
based on particle filtering to enforce multi-view consistency of the 3D
bounding boxes while minimizing computational complexity. Extensive experiments
on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance among online methods. Benefiting from this novel
reconstruction-free paradigm for 3D object detection, our method exhibits great
generalization abilities in various scenarios, enabling real-time perception
even in environments exceeding 1000 square meters.

*Roey Ron,Guy Tevet,Haim Sawdayee,Amit H. Bermano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HOIDiNi是一个基于文本驱动的扩散框架，用于生成真实且合理的人-物交互（HOI），通过Diffusion Noise Optimization（DNO）在预训练扩散模型的噪声空间中优化，实现了高真实性和物理准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的人-物交互生成方法在真实性和物理正确性之间存在权衡，HOIDiNi旨在同时实现这两者。

Method: HOIDiNi将问题分为两个阶段：对象中心阶段（选择手-物接触位置）和人体中心阶段（优化全身动作），通过DNO在噪声空间中直接优化。

Result: 在GRAB数据集上的定量、定性和主观评估表明，HOIDiNi在接触准确性、物理有效性和整体质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HOIDiNi能够仅通过文本提示生成复杂且可控的交互动作，如抓取、放置和全身协调。

Abstract: We present HOIDiNi, a text-driven diffusion framework for synthesizing
realistic and plausible human-object interaction (HOI). HOI generation is
extremely challenging since it induces strict contact accuracies alongside a
diverse motion manifold. While current literature trades off between realism
and physical correctness, HOIDiNi optimizes directly in the noise space of a
pretrained diffusion model using Diffusion Noise Optimization (DNO), achieving
both. This is made feasible thanks to our observation that the problem can be
separated into two phases: an object-centric phase, primarily making discrete
choices of hand-object contact locations, and a human-centric phase that
refines the full-body motion to realize this blueprint. This structured
approach allows for precise hand-object contact without compromising motion
naturalness. Quantitative, qualitative, and subjective evaluations on the GRAB
dataset alone clearly indicate HOIDiNi outperforms prior works and baselines in
contact accuracy, physical validity, and overall quality. Our results
demonstrate the ability to generate complex, controllable interactions,
including grasping, placing, and full-body coordination, driven solely by
textual prompts. https://hoidini.github.io.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现，多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视觉质量与性能之间存在矛盾：图像偏离人类感知的高保真度时，模型表现反而更好。为此，作者提出了一种轻量级适配模块VQ-TTT，动态调整输入图像以适应任务需求，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉输入质量对MLLMs性能的影响，发现高保真图像未必带来更好的模型表现，反而存在矛盾现象。

Method: 提出VQ-TTT模块，通过插入可学习的低秩核和微调浅层视觉编码器，动态调整输入图像以适应模型偏好。

Result: VQ-TTT显著提升了MLLMs在多个数据集上的平均准确率，且无需外部模型或额外训练数据。

Conclusion: 研究重新定义了MLLMs的“更好”视觉输入标准，强调需要自适应而非普遍“干净”的图像，以适应AI作为主要数据消费者的新时代。

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel on benchmark
vision-language tasks, yet little is known about how input visual quality
shapes their responses. Does higher perceptual quality of images already
translate to better MLLM understanding? We conduct the first systematic study
spanning leading MLLMs and a suite of vision-language benchmarks, applying
controlled degradations and stylistic shifts to each image. Surprisingly, we
uncover a visual-quality paradox: model, task, and even individual-instance
performance can improve when images deviate from human-perceived fidelity.
Off-the-shelf restoration pipelines fail to reconcile these idiosyncratic
preferences. To close the gap, we introduce Visual-Quality Test-Time Tuning
(VQ-TTT)-a lightweight adaptation module that: (1) inserts a learnable,
low-rank kernel before the frozen vision encoder to modulate frequency content;
and (2) fine-tunes only shallow vision-encoder layers via LoRA. VQ-TTT
dynamically adjusts each input image in a single forward pass, aligning it with
task-specific model preferences. Across the evaluated MLLMs and all datasets,
VQ-TTT lifts significant average accuracy, with no external models, cached
features, or extra training data. These findings redefine ``better'' visual
inputs for MLLMs and highlight the need for adaptive, rather than universally
``clean'', imagery, in the new era of AI being the main data customer.

TL;DR: ViMaR是一种两阶段推理框架，通过结合时间差分价值模型和边缘感知奖励调整，提升视觉语言模型的效率和输出保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法计算成本高且易产生低置信度生成，导致持续幻觉问题。

Method: 两阶段框架：首阶段筛选高价值候选描述，次阶段选择性优化弱视觉基础部分，并引入边缘惩罚机制。

Result: ViMaR显著提升描述的可靠性、准确性和细节，速度提升4倍以上，且能跨模型泛化。

Conclusion: ViMaR具有灵活性、可扩展性和自训练潜力，为高效、准确的视觉语言模型解码策略。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in inference-time search for vision-language
models (VLMs), existing approaches remain both computationally expensive and
prone to unpenalized, low-confidence generations which often lead to persistent
hallucinations. We introduce \textbf{Value-guided Inference with Margin-based
Reward (ViMaR)}, a two-stage inference framework that improves both efficiency
and output fidelity by combining a temporal-difference value model with a
margin-aware reward adjustment. In the first stage, we perform a single pass to
identify the highest-value caption among diverse candidates. In the second
stage, we selectively refine only those segments that were overlooked or
exhibit weak visual grounding, thereby eliminating frequently rewarded
evaluations. A calibrated margin-based penalty discourages low-confidence
continuations while preserving descriptive richness. Extensive experiments
across multiple VLM architectures demonstrate that ViMaR generates captions
that are significantly more reliable, factually accurate, detailed, and
explanatory, while achieving over 4$\times$ speedup compared to existing
value-guided methods. Specifically, we show that ViMaR trained solely on LLaVA
Mistral-7B, \textit{generalizes effectively to guide decoding in a stronger
unseen model}. To further validate this, we adapt the ViMaR to steer generation
in LLaVA-OneVision-Qwen2-7B, leading to consistent improvements in caption
quality and demonstrating robust cross-model guidance. This cross-model
generalization highlights ViMaR's flexibility and modularity, positioning it as
a scalable and transferable inference-time decoding strategy. Furthermore, when
ViMaR-generated captions are used for self-training, the underlying models
achieve substantial gains across a broad suite of visual comprehension
benchmarks, underscoring the potential of fast, accurate, and self-improving
VLM pipelines.

Motivation: 解决现有端到端重光照模型因多光照数据稀缺而泛化能力不足的问题，以及两阶段方法在复杂光照或材质下易出错和输出不真实的局限性。

Method: 联合估计反照率和生成重光照输出的单阶段方法，结合视频扩散模型的生成能力，利用合成多光照数据和自动标注的真实视频进行训练。

Result: 模型在多种领域表现出强泛化能力，在视觉保真度和时间一致性上超越先前方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过单阶段联合优化，显著提升了重光照任务的真实性和泛化能力。

Abstract: We address the challenge of relighting a single image or video, a task that
demands precise scene intrinsic understanding and high-quality light transport
synthesis. Existing end-to-end relighting models are often limited by the
scarcity of paired multi-illumination data, restricting their ability to
generalize across diverse scenes. Conversely, two-stage pipelines that combine
inverse and forward rendering can mitigate data requirements but are
susceptible to error accumulation and often fail to produce realistic outputs
under complex lighting conditions or with sophisticated materials. In this
work, we introduce a general-purpose approach that jointly estimates albedo and
synthesizes relit outputs in a single pass, harnessing the generative
capabilities of video diffusion models. This joint formulation enhances
implicit scene comprehension and facilitates the creation of realistic lighting
effects and intricate material interactions, such as shadows, reflections, and
transparency. Trained on synthetic multi-illumination data and extensive
automatically labeled real-world videos, our model demonstrates strong
generalization across diverse domains and surpasses previous methods in both
visual fidelity and temporal consistency.

Abstract: Video generation techniques have made remarkable progress, promising to be
the foundation of interactive world exploration. However, existing video
generation datasets are not well-suited for world exploration training as they
suffer from some limitations: limited locations, short duration, static scenes,
and a lack of annotations about exploration and the world. In this paper, we
introduce Sekai (meaning ``world'' in Japanese), a high-quality first-person
view worldwide video dataset with rich annotations for world exploration. It
consists of over 5,000 hours of walking or drone view (FPV and UVA) videos from
over 100 countries and regions across 750 cities. We develop an efficient and
effective toolbox to collect, pre-process and annotate videos with location,
scene, weather, crowd density, captions, and camera trajectories. Experiments
demonstrate the quality of the dataset. And, we use a subset to train an
interactive video world exploration model, named YUME (meaning ``dream'' in
Japanese). We believe Sekai will benefit the area of video generation and world
exploration, and motivate valuable applications.

TL;DR: ECAD是一种基于遗传算法的方法，通过学习高效的缓存调度来加速扩散模型的推理，无需修改网络参数或参考图像，显著提升速度并保持质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型生成高质量图像但推理速度慢且计算成本高，现有方法依赖固定启发式规则，效果有限。

Method: 提出ECAD，利用遗传算法学习每个模型的缓存调度，形成帕累托前沿，仅需少量校准提示。

Result: 在多个模型和基准测试中，ECAD显著提升推理速度（如PixArt-alpha加速至2.58倍），同时保持或提升生成质量。

Conclusion: ECAD是一种可扩展且通用的扩散模型加速方法，适用于不同模型和分辨率。

Abstract: Diffusion-based image generation models excel at producing high-quality
synthetic content, but suffer from slow and computationally expensive
inference. Prior work has attempted to mitigate this by caching and reusing
features within diffusion transformers across inference steps. These methods,
however, often rely on rigid heuristics that result in limited acceleration or
poor generalization across architectures. We propose Evolutionary Caching to
Accelerate Diffusion models (ECAD), a genetic algorithm that learns efficient,
per-model, caching schedules forming a Pareto frontier, using only a small set
of calibration prompts. ECAD requires no modifications to network parameters or
reference images. It offers significant inference speedups, enables
fine-grained control over the quality-latency trade-off, and adapts seamlessly
to different diffusion models. Notably, ECAD's learned schedules can generalize
effectively to resolutions and model variants not seen during calibration. We
evaluate ECAD on PixArt-alpha, PixArt-Sigma, and FLUX-1.dev using multiple
metrics (FID, CLIP, Image Reward) across diverse benchmarks (COCO, MJHQ-30k,
PartiPrompts), demonstrating consistent improvements over previous approaches.
On PixArt-alpha, ECAD identifies a schedule that outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art method by 4.47 COCO FID while increasing inference speedup
from 2.35x to 2.58x. Our results establish ECAD as a scalable and generalizable
approach for accelerating diffusion inference. Our project website is available

Conclusion: EffVR为可持续移动VR提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Mobile Virtual Reality (VR) is essential to achieving convenient and
immersive human-computer interaction and realizing emerging applications such
as Metaverse. However, existing VR technologies require two separate renderings
of binocular images, causing a significant bottleneck for mobile devices with
limited computing capability and power supply. This paper proposes an approach
to rendering optimization for mobile VR called EffVR. By utilizing the
per-pixel attribute, EffVR can generate binocular VR images from the monocular
image through genuinely one rendering, saving half the computation over
conventional approaches. Our evaluation indicates that, compared with the
state-of-art, EffVRcan save 27% power consumption on average while achieving
high binocular image quality (0.9679 SSIM and 34.09 PSNR) in mobile VR
applications. Additionally, EffVR can increase the frame rate by 115.2%. These
results corroborate EffVRsuperior computation/energy-saving performance, paving
the road to a sustainable mobile VR. The source code, demo video, android app,

Conclusion: 该方法为松散IMU姿态估计提供了新方向，未来研究潜力大。

Abstract: Motion capture using sparse inertial sensors has shown great promise due to
its portability and lack of occlusion issues compared to camera-based tracking.
Existing approaches typically assume that IMU sensors are tightly attached to
the human body. However, this assumption often does not hold in real-world
scenarios. In this paper, we present a new task of full-body human pose
estimation using sparse, loosely attached IMU sensors. To solve this task, we
simulate IMU recordings from an existing garment-aware human motion dataset. We
developed transformer-based diffusion models to synthesize loose IMU data and
estimate human poses based on this challenging loose IMU data. In addition, we
show that incorporating garment-related parameters while training the model on
simulated loose data effectively maintains expressiveness and enhances the
ability to capture variations introduced by looser or tighter garments.
Experiments show that our proposed diffusion methods trained on simulated and
synthetic data outperformed the state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and
qualitatively, opening up a promising direction for future research.

Conclusion: 该方法更便捷且适用性更广，数据集将公开。

Abstract: Face sketch synthesis is a technique aimed at converting face photos into
sketches. Existing face sketch synthesis research mainly relies on training
with numerous photo-sketch sample pairs from existing datasets. However, these
large-scale discriminative learning methods will have to face problems such as
data scarcity and high human labor costs. Once the training data becomes
scarce, their generative performance significantly degrades. In this paper, we
propose a one-shot face sketch synthesis method based on diffusion models. We
optimize text instructions on a diffusion model using face photo-sketch image
pairs. Then, the instructions derived through gradient-based optimization are
used for inference. To simulate real-world scenarios more accurately and
evaluate method effectiveness more comprehensively, we introduce a new
benchmark named One-shot Face Sketch Dataset (OS-Sketch). The benchmark
consists of 400 pairs of face photo-sketch images, including sketches with
different styles and photos with different backgrounds, ages, sexes,
expressions, illumination, etc. For a solid out-of-distribution evaluation, we
select only one pair of images for training at each time, with the rest used
for inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can
convert various photos into realistic and highly consistent sketches in a
one-shot context. Compared to other methods, our approach offers greater
convenience and broader applicability. The dataset will be available at:

Result: 实验表明，Nabla-R2D3在少量微调步骤内能获得更高奖励并减少先验遗忘。

Conclusion: Nabla-R2D3为3D生成提供了一种高效且样本利用率高的对齐方法。

Abstract: Generating high-quality and photorealistic 3D assets remains a longstanding
challenge in 3D vision and computer graphics. Although state-of-the-art
generative models, such as diffusion models, have made significant progress in
3D generation, they often fall short of human-designed content due to limited
ability to follow instructions, align with human preferences, or produce
realistic textures, geometries, and physical attributes. In this paper, we
introduce Nabla-R2D3, a highly effective and sample-efficient reinforcement
learning alignment framework for 3D-native diffusion models using 2D rewards.
Built upon the recently proposed Nabla-GFlowNet method, which matches the score
function to reward gradients in a principled manner for reward finetuning, our
Nabla-R2D3 enables effective adaptation of 3D diffusion models using only 2D
reward signals. Extensive experiments show that, unlike vanilla finetuning
baselines which either struggle to converge or suffer from reward hacking,
Nabla-R2D3 consistently achieves higher rewards and reduced prior forgetting
within a few finetuning steps.

Result: 模型能够识别并证明借贷协议的经济和策略动态相关关键特性。

Conclusion: 形式化模型有助于评估借贷协议的结构和经济特性，分析用户策略和潜在攻击。

Abstract: Lending protocols are one of the main applications of Decentralized Finance
(DeFi), enabling crypto-assets loan markets with a total value estimated in the
tens of billions of dollars. Unlike traditional lending systems, these
protocols operate without relying on trusted authorities or off-chain
enforcement mechanisms. To achieve key economic goals such as stability of the
loan market, they devise instead trustless on-chain mechanisms, such as
rewarding liquidators who repay the loans of under-collateralized borrowers by
awarding them part of the borrower's collateral. The complexity of these
incentive mechanisms, combined with their entanglement in low-level
implementation details, makes it challenging to precisely assess the structural
and economic properties of lending protocols, as well as to analyze user
strategies and attacks. Crucially, since participation is open to anyone, any
weaknesses in the incentive mechanism may give rise to unintended emergent
behaviours, or even enable adversarial strategies aimed at making profits to
the detriment of legit users, or at undermining the stability of the protocol.
In this work, we propose a formal model of lending protocols that captures the
essential features of mainstream platforms, enabling us to identify and prove
key properties related to their economic and strategic dynamics.

TL;DR: EFX分配问题在图论中的复杂性分析，揭示了二分图和多色图的算法界限，并探讨了参数化方法对问题可解性的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EFX分配在公平分割中是一个核心概念，但其存在性和计算复杂性尚未完全解决。研究旨在探索EFX-orientation在图论中的算法边界，特别是二分图和多色图的区别。

Method: 通过参数化图算法分析EFX-orientation的复杂性，重点关注二分图、对称二元估值以及图的树宽限制。

Result: 发现二分图是多项式时间可解的，而即使接近二分图或引入非二元估值，问题仍为NP难。此外，树宽有限的图可在线性时间内解决。

Conclusion: EFX-orientation的复杂性高度依赖于图的结构和估值类型，参数化方法为特定情况提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Since its introduction, envy-freeness up to any good (EFX) has become a
fundamental solution concept in fair division of indivisible goods. Its
existence remains elusive -- even for four agents with additive utility
functions, it is unknown whether an EFX allocation always exists.
Unsurprisingly, restricted settings to delineate tractable and intractable
cases have been explored. Christadolou, Fiat et al.[EC'23] introduced the
notion of EFX-orientation, where the agents form the vertices of a graph and
the items correspond to edges, and an agent values only the items that are
incident to it. The goal is to allocate items to one of the adjacent agents
while satisfying the EFX condition.
  Building on the work of Zeng and Mehta'24, which established a sharp
complexity threshold based on the structure of the underlying graph --
polynomial-time solvability for bipartite graphs and NP-hardness for graphs
with chromatic number at least three -- we further explore the algorithmic
landscape of EFX-orientation using parameterized graph algorithms.
  Specifically, we show that bipartiteness is a surprisingly stringent
condition for tractability: EFX orientation is NP-complete even when the
valuations are symmetric, binary and the graph is at most two edge-removals
away from being bipartite. Moreover, introducing a single non-binary value
makes the problem NP-hard even when the graph is only one edge removal away
from being bipartite. We further perform a parameterized analysis to examine
structures of the underlying graph that enable tractability. In particular, we
show that the problem is solvable in linear time on graphs whose treewidth is
bounded by a constant and that the complexity of an instance is closely tied to
the sizes of acyclic connected components on its one-valued edges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习系统在关键决策中的作用增强，人类可理解的解释需求增加。现有XAI评估常忽视认知可访问性，尤其是对视觉障碍用户。

Method: 提出CUE模型，通过实验（N=455）测试不同颜色热图（BWR、Cividis、Coolwarm）对视觉障碍用户的影响。

Result: 任务表现相似，但视觉障碍用户的信心和努力较低，且可访问性颜色图（如Cividis）未改善甚至加剧差距。

Conclusion: 结果挑战了感知优化假设，支持自适应XAI界面需求，验证了CUE模型，并强调用户定制化XAI的重要性。

Abstract: As machine learning systems increasingly inform critical decisions, the need
for human-understandable explanations grows. Current evaluations of Explainable
AI (XAI) often prioritize technical fidelity over cognitive accessibility which
critically affects users, in particular those with visual impairments. We
propose CUE, a model for Cognitive Understanding of Explanations, linking
explanation properties to cognitive sub-processes: legibility (perception),
readability (comprehension), and interpretability (interpretation). In a study
(N=455) testing heatmaps with varying colormaps (BWR, Cividis, Coolwarm), we
found comparable task performance but lower confidence/effort for visually
impaired users. Unlike expected, these gaps were not mitigated and sometimes
worsened by accessibility-focused color maps like Cividis. These results
challenge assumptions about perceptual optimization and support the need for
adaptive XAI interfaces. They also validate CUE by demonstrating that altering
explanation legibility affects understandability. We contribute: (1) a
formalized cognitive model for explanation understanding, (2) an integrated
definition of human-centered explanation properties, and (3) empirical evidence
motivating accessible, user-tailored XAI.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: WebXAII是一个开源框架，旨在简化人类与可解释人工智能（XAI）交互的研究，提供可复用的实验协议实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: XAI领域快速发展，但现有研究通常使用临时接口，缺乏共享和可复现性。

Method: 设计并实现WebXAII，一个基于web的平台，支持完整实验协议的配置和执行，通过结构化文件定义架构。

Result: 成功复现了文献中的先进研究协议，验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: WebXAII为XAI交互研究提供了灵活且易用的工具，促进实验的共享和复现。

Abstract: This article introduces WebXAII, an open-source web framework designed to
facilitate research on human interaction with eXplainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) systems. The field of XAI is rapidly expanding, driven by
the growing societal implications of the widespread adoption of AI (and in
particular machine learning) across diverse applications. Researchers who study
the interaction between humans and XAI techniques typically develop ad hoc
interfaces in order to conduct their studies. These interfaces are usually not
shared alongside the results of the studies, which limits their reusability and
the reproducibility of experiments. In response, we design and implement
WebXAII, a web-based platform that can embody full experimental protocols,
meaning that it can present all aspects of the experiment to human participants
and record their responses. The experimental protocols are translated into a
composite architecture of generic views and modules, which offers a lot of
flexibility. The architecture is defined in a structured configuration file, so
that protocols can be implemented with minimal programming skills. We
demonstrate that WebXAII can effectively embody relevant protocols, by
reproducing the protocol of a state-of-the-art study of the literature. The
framework is available at https://github.com/PAJEAN/WebXAII.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于CLIP模型的AI工具，用于分析媒体内容中角色的性别和年龄分布，并通过用户研究验证了其有用性和可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探讨AI生成的性别和年龄分布数据对公众的实际用处和可信度。

Method: 方法包括开发基于CLIP模型的工具来分析视觉数据，设计可视化界面，并进行用户研究。

Result: 结果显示用户认为工具总体有用，但对AI模型的信任度中等偏低，且希望增加更多人口统计类别和上下文信息。

Conclusion: 结论是AI工具在角色分析中有潜力，但需改进以提升用户信任和实用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI has enabled automated analysis of complex media content
at scale and generate actionable insights regarding character representation
along such dimensions as gender and age. Past work focused on quantifying
representation from audio/video/text using various ML models, but without
having the audience in the loop. We ask, even if character distribution along
demographic dimensions are available, how useful are they to the general
public? Do they actually trust the numbers generated by AI models? Our work
addresses these questions through a user study, while proposing a new AI-based
character representation and visualization tool. Our tool based on the
Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) foundation model to analyze
visual screen data to quantify character representation across dimensions of
age and gender. We also designed effective visualizations suitable for
presenting such analytics to lay audience. Next, we conducted a user study to
seek empirical evidence on the usefulness and trustworthiness of the
AI-generated results for carefully chosen movies presented in the form of our
visualizations. We note that participants were able to understand the analytics
from our visualization, and deemed the tool `overall useful'. Participants also
indicated a need for more detailed visualizations to include more demographic
categories and contextual information of the characters. Participants' trust in
AI-based gender and age models is seen to be moderate to low, although they
were not against the use of AI in this context. Our tool including code,
benchmarking, and data from the user study can be found here:

Result: 首次将IS成功模型应用于生成式AI系统，提出混合评估框架并实现风险控制。

Conclusion: LLM可有效加速数据收集并保持问卷质量，混合评估和保障措施支持其负责任地集成到IS工作流程中。

Abstract: Surveys are a cornerstone of Information Systems (IS) research, yet creating
high-quality surveys remains labor-intensive, requiring both domain expertise
and methodological rigor. With the evolution of large language models (LLMs),
new opportunities emerge to automate survey generation. This paper presents the
real-world deployment of an LLM-powered system designed to accelerate data
collection while maintaining survey quality. Deploying such systems in
production introduces real-world complexity, including diverse user needs and
quality control. We evaluate the system using the DeLone and McLean IS Success
Model to understand how generative AI can reshape a core IS method. This study
makes three key contributions. To our knowledge, this is the first application
of the IS Success Model to a generative AI system for survey creation. In
addition, we propose a hybrid evaluation framework combining automated and
human assessments. Finally, we implement safeguards that mitigate
post-deployment risks and support responsible integration into IS workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于降维可视化分析中存在固有的失真等问题，文献中提出了多种方法以提高其可靠性，但文献的多样性和广泛性使新手难以入手。

Method: 基于先前对相关文献的分类，提出了一份指南，帮助用户评估当前DR专业知识并选择适合的文献。

Result: 通过与三位DR和数据可视化专家的访谈研究，验证了指南的重要性、全面性和实用性。

Conclusion: 该指南为新手提供了可靠的起点，帮助他们在DR可视化分析领域进一步学习和研究。

Abstract: Visual analytics using dimensionality reduction (DR) can easily be unreliable
for various reasons, e.g., inherent distortions in representing the original
data. The literature has thus proposed a wide range of methodologies to make
DR-based visual analytics reliable. However, the diversity and extensiveness of
the literature can leave novice analysts and researchers uncertain about where
to begin and proceed. To address this problem, we propose a guide for reading
papers for reliable visual analytics with DR. Relying on the previous
classification of the relevant literature, our guide helps both practitioners
to (1) assess their current DR expertise and (2) identify papers that will
further enhance their understanding. Interview studies with three experts in DR
and data visualizations validate the significance, comprehensiveness, and
usefulness of our guide.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文探讨了AI4SI（AI for Social Impact）项目在实现实际社会影响时面临的挑战，包括合作困难、项目难以规模化以及学术界对其认可不足等问题，并提出了一些实践策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI4SI项目旨在利用AI技术解决社会问题，如医疗和社会公正，但实际落地和规模化面临诸多障碍。本文试图揭示这些挑战，并为研究者提供实用指导。

Method: 通过半结构化访谈六位领先的AI4SI研究者，并结合作者自身经验，进行主题分析，识别出部署AI4SI解决方案的关键障碍。

Result: 研究发现，结构性、组织性、沟通、协作和操作性问题是实现AI4SI项目实际影响的主要障碍。

Conclusion: 尽管没有简单解决方案，但本文总结了最佳实践和可操作策略，为AI4SI研究者和合作伙伴提供了实用参考。

Abstract: In an attempt to tackle the UN SDGs, AI for Social Impact (AI4SI) projects
focus on harnessing AI to address societal issues in areas such as healthcare,
social justice, etc. Unfortunately, despite growing interest in AI4SI,
achieving tangible, on-the-ground impact remains a significant challenge. For
example, identifying and engaging motivated collaborators who are willing to
co-design and deploy AI based solutions in real-world settings is often
difficult. Even when such partnerships are established, many AI4SI projects
"fail" to progress beyond the proof-of-concept stage, and hence, are unable to
transition to at-scale production-level solutions. Furthermore, the unique
challenges faced by AI4SI researchers are not always fully recognized within
the broader AI community, where such work is sometimes viewed as primarily
applied and not aligning with the traditional criteria for novelty emphasized
in core AI venues. This paper attempts to shine a light on the diverse
challenges faced in AI4SI research by diagnosing a multitude of factors that
prevent AI4SI partnerships from achieving real-world impact on the ground.
Drawing on semi-structured interviews with six leading AI4SI researchers -
complemented by the authors' own lived experiences in conducting AI4SI research
- this paper attempts to understand the day-to-day difficulties faced in
developing and deploying socially impactful AI solutions. Through thematic
analysis, we identify structural and organizational, communication,
collaboration, and operational challenges as key barriers to deployment. While
there are no easy fixes, we synthesize best practices and actionable strategies
drawn from these interviews and our own work in this space. In doing so, we
hope this paper serves as a practical reference guide for AI4SI researchers and
partner organizations seeking to engage more effectively in socially impactful
AI collaborations.

### [107] [Structured Moral Reasoning in Language Models: A Value-Grounded Evaluation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14948)
*Mohna Chakraborty,Lu Wang,David Jurgens*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于价值的框架，用于评估和提炼大型语言模型（LLMs）中的结构化道德推理，发现显式道德提示能提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在道德理解领域表现不足，其推理常与人类道德推理脱节，导致复杂场景中的偏见决策。

Method: 通过基于价值系统、伦理理论和认知推理策略的提示分类法，评估了12个开源模型在四个道德数据集上的表现。

Result: 显式道德提示显著提升了准确性和连贯性，尤其是基于第一原则推理和Schwartz+关怀伦理的框架。监督蒸馏方法成功将道德能力从小模型转移到大模型。

Conclusion: 研究为开发可解释且基于价值的模型提供了可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in domains requiring
moral understanding, yet their reasoning often remains shallow, and misaligned
with human reasoning. Unlike humans, whose moral reasoning integrates
contextual trade-offs, value systems, and ethical theories, LLMs often rely on
surface patterns, leading to biased decisions in morally and ethically complex
scenarios. To address this gap, we present a value-grounded framework for
evaluating and distilling structured moral reasoning in LLMs. We benchmark 12
open-source models across four moral datasets using a taxonomy of prompts
grounded in value systems, ethical theories, and cognitive reasoning
strategies. Our evaluation is guided by four questions: (1) Does reasoning
improve LLM decision-making over direct prompting? (2) Which types of
value/ethical frameworks most effectively guide LLM reasoning? (3) Which
cognitive reasoning strategies lead to better moral performance? (4) Can
small-sized LLMs acquire moral competence through distillation? We find that
prompting with explicit moral structure consistently improves accuracy and
coherence, with first-principles reasoning and Schwartz's + care-ethics
scaffolds yielding the strongest gains. Furthermore, our supervised
distillation approach transfers moral competence from large to small models
without additional inference cost. Together, our results offer a scalable path
toward interpretable and value-grounded models.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合DALL-E 3与材料数据集的管道，为AI生成的设计提供可持续性指标和材料使用洞察，并通过用户测试验证其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI（如文本到图像模型）在室内建筑设计中的应用虽然快速且视觉效果好，但缺乏可操作的数据支持设计师。因此，需要一种方法将可持续性指标融入设计流程。

Method: 提出一种管道，在DALL-E 3生成设计图像后，通过后处理模块识别材料并匹配CO2e值，从而提供环境影响的即时评估。通过三种用户测试验证效果。

Result: 引入可持续性指标（尤其是定量CO2e数据）能促进更明智的设计决策，但也可能引发决策疲劳和满意度下降。多数用户在测试中开始整合可持续性原则。

Conclusion: 平衡设计自由与实用约束是关键，该研究为AI辅助建筑设计提供了数据驱动的可持续解决方案路径。

Abstract: Generative AI, specifically text-to-image models, have revolutionized
interior architectural design by enabling the rapid translation of conceptual
ideas into visual representations from simple text prompts. While generative AI
can produce visually appealing images they often lack actionable data for
designers In this work, we propose a novel pipeline that integrates DALL-E 3
with a materials dataset to enrich AI-generated designs with sustainability
metrics and material usage insights. After the model generates an interior
design image, a post-processing module identifies the top ten materials present
and pairs them with carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) values from a general
materials dictionary. This approach allows designers to immediately evaluate
environmental impacts and refine prompts accordingly. We evaluate the system
through three user tests: (1) no mention of sustainability to the user prior to
the prompting process with generative AI, (2) sustainability goals communicated
to the user before prompting, and (3) sustainability goals communicated along
with quantitative CO2e data included in the generative AI outputs. Our
qualitative and quantitative analyses reveal that the introduction of
sustainability metrics in the third test leads to more informed design
decisions, however, it can also trigger decision fatigue and lower overall
satisfaction. Nevertheless, the majority of participants reported incorporating
sustainability principles into their workflows in the third test, underscoring
the potential of integrated metrics to guide more ecologically responsible
practices. Our findings showcase the importance of balancing design freedom
with practical constraints, offering a clear path toward holistic, data-driven
solutions in AI-assisted architectural design.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AD/ADRD照顾者面临巨大压力，而生成式AI（如LLMs）在心理健康支持方面的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 开发Carey聊天机器人，通过情景驱动的半结构化访谈与16名照顾者互动，并进行主题分析。

Result: 识别出照顾者的六大需求主题及对AI的矛盾心理，提出了设计建议。

Conclusion: 研究为设计更可信、以照顾者为中心的AI系统提供了理论与实践指导。

Abstract: Family caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Related
Dementia (AD/ADRD) face significant emotional and logistical challenges that
place them at heightened risk for stress, anxiety, and depression. Although
recent advances in generative AI -- particularly large language models (LLMs)
-- offer new opportunities to support mental health, little is known about how
caregivers perceive and engage with such technologies. To address this gap, we
developed Carey, a GPT-4o-based chatbot designed to provide informational and
emotional support to AD/ADRD caregivers. Using Carey as a technology probe, we
conducted semi-structured interviews with 16 family caregivers following
scenario-driven interactions grounded in common caregiving stressors. Through
inductive coding and reflexive thematic analysis, we surface a systemic
understanding of caregiver needs and expectations across six themes --
on-demand information access, emotional support, safe space for disclosure,
crisis management, personalization, and data privacy. For each of these themes,
we also identified the nuanced tensions in the caregivers' desires and
concerns. We present a mapping of caregiver needs, AI chatbot's strengths,
gaps, and design recommendations. Our findings offer theoretical and practical
insights to inform the design of proactive, trustworthy, and caregiver-centered
AI systems that better support the evolving mental health needs of AD/ADRD
caregivers.

Abstract: As robots enter collaborative workspaces, ensuring mutual understanding
between human workers and robotic systems becomes a prerequisite for trust,
safety, and efficiency. In this position paper, we draw on the cooperation
scenario of the AIMotive project in which a human and a cobot jointly perform
assembly tasks to argue for a structured approach to intent communication.
Building on the Situation Awareness-based Agent Transparency (SAT) framework
and the notion of task abstraction levels, we propose a multidimensional design
space that maps intent content (SAT1, SAT3), planning horizon (operational to
strategic), and modality (visual, auditory, haptic). We illustrate how this
space can guide the design of multimodal communication strategies tailored to
dynamic collaborative work contexts. With this paper, we lay the conceptual
foundation for a future design toolkit aimed at supporting transparent
human-robot interaction in the workplace. We highlight key open questions and
design challenges, and propose a shared agenda for multimodal, adaptive, and
trustworthy robotic collaboration in hybrid work environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统AI教学中单向知识传递的局限性，探索不同模态信息的整合。

Method: 采用基于MHNG的人类-AI互动模型，通过在线实验（69名参与者）测试三种AI代理类型的效果。

Result: MH-based AI显著提升了分类准确性，人类接受行为与MH概率高度一致。

Conclusion: 共创学习为人类与AI的动态对齐提供了新路径，推动了共生AI系统的发展。

Abstract: We propose co-creative learning as a novel paradigm where humans and AI,
i.e., biological and artificial agents, mutually integrate their partial
perceptual information and knowledge to construct shared external
representations, a process we interpret as symbol emergence. Unlike traditional
AI teaching based on unilateral knowledge transfer, this addresses the
challenge of integrating information from inherently different modalities. We
empirically test this framework using a human-AI interaction model based on the
Metropolis-Hastings naming game (MHNG), a decentralized Bayesian inference
mechanism. In an online experiment, 69 participants played a joint attention
naming game (JA-NG) with one of three computer agent types (MH-based,
always-accept, or always-reject) under partial observability. Results show that
human-AI pairs with an MH-based agent significantly improved categorization
accuracy through interaction and achieved stronger convergence toward a shared
sign system. Furthermore, human acceptance behavior aligned closely with the
MH-derived acceptance probability. These findings provide the first empirical
evidence for co-creative learning emerging in human-AI dyads via MHNG-based
interaction. This suggests a promising path toward symbiotic AI systems that
learn with humans, rather than from them, by dynamically aligning perceptual
experiences, opening a new venue for symbiotic AI alignment.

Abstract: Large Language Models have brought a radical change in the process of remote
learning students, among other aspects of educative activities. Current
retrieval of remote learning resources lacks depth in contextual meaning that
provides comprehensive information on complex student queries. This work
proposes a novel approach to enhancing remote learning retrieval by integrating
GPT-based models within the LangChain framework. We achieve this system in a
more intuitive and productive manner using CoT reasoning and prompt
engineering. The framework we propose puts much emphasis on increasing the
precision and relevance of the retrieval results to return comprehensive and
contextually enriched explanations and resources that best suit each student's
needs. We also assess the effectiveness of our approach against paradigmatic
LLMs and report improvements in user satisfaction and learning outcomes.

Motivation: 生成式AI（GenAI）对高中环境的影响日益显著，但此前研究很少关注高中生的视角。本研究旨在填补这一空白，通过学生的参与设计，为GenAI在学校的整合提供依据。

Method: 研究组织了17名高中生参与的参与式设计工作坊，学生设计了GenAI工具和学校政策，重点关注偏见、犯罪、过度依赖AI和学术不端指控等问题。

Result: 学生提出了理想的GenAI工具功能、学校使用规范和法规，研究基于这些见解提出了针对教育技术设计者的新指南。

Conclusion: 研究强调在GenAI技术开发和学校AI政策制定中应更多纳入学生视角，以确保技术的合理应用。

Abstract: As generative AI (GenAI) emerges as a transformative force, clear
understanding of high school students' perspectives is essential for GenAI's
meaningful integration in high school environments. In this work, we draw
insights from a participatory design workshop where we engaged 17 high school
students -- a group rarely involved in prior research in this area -- through
the design of novel GenAI tools and school policies addressing their key
concerns. Students identified challenges and developed solutions outlining
their ideal features in GenAI tools, appropriate school use, and regulations.
These centered around the problem spaces of combating bias & misinformation,
tackling crime & plagiarism, preventing over-reliance on AI, and handling false
accusations of academic dishonesty. Building on our participants'
underrepresented perspectives, we propose new guidelines targeted at
educational technology designers for development of GenAI technologies in high
schools. We also argue for further incorporation of student voices in
development of AI policies in their schools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策复杂且易受认知偏差和不完整信息影响，现有LLM工具的单次交互模式难以满足实际需求。

Method: 开发MedSyn框架，支持医师与LLM动态对话，挑战建议并探讨替代方案。

Result: 开源LLM在模拟实验中显示出作为医师助手的潜力。

Conclusion: 未来将通过真实医师交互验证MedSyn在诊断准确性和患者结果中的实用性。

Abstract: Clinical decision-making is inherently complex, often influenced by cognitive
biases, incomplete information, and case ambiguity. Large Language Models
(LLMs) have shown promise as tools for supporting clinical decision-making, yet
their typical one-shot or limited-interaction usage may overlook the
complexities of real-world medical practice. In this work, we propose a hybrid
human-AI framework, MedSyn, where physicians and LLMs engage in multi-step,
interactive dialogues to refine diagnoses and treatment decisions. Unlike
static decision-support tools, MedSyn enables dynamic exchanges, allowing
physicians to challenge LLM suggestions while the LLM highlights alternative
perspectives. Through simulated physician-LLM interactions, we assess the
potential of open-source LLMs as physician assistants. Results show open-source
LLMs are promising as physician assistants in the real world. Future work will
involve real physician interactions to further validate MedSyn's usefulness in
diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种二维并行回火算法（2D-PT），通过引入惩罚强度的第二维度副本，解决了传统并行回火算法在约束优化问题中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机器学习和优化中，Boltzmann概率分布的采样是关键，但现有方法（如Ising机）在处理约束时面临惩罚强度难以调优的问题。

Method: 扩展了并行回火算法，增加了一个惩罚强度的副本维度，确保约束满足并提升混合效率。

Result: 在图形稀疏化和Wishart实例中，2D-PT表现出理想混合效果，显著优于传统PT。

Conclusion: 2D-PT适用于广泛约束Ising问题，可直接部署于现有Ising机，无需手动调优惩罚强度。

Abstract: Sampling Boltzmann probability distributions plays a key role in machine
learning and optimization, motivating the design of hardware accelerators such
as Ising machines. While the Ising model can in principle encode arbitrary
optimization problems, practical implementations are often hindered by soft
constraints that either slow down mixing when too strong, or fail to enforce
feasibility when too weak. We introduce a two-dimensional extension of the
powerful parallel tempering algorithm (PT) that addresses this challenge by
adding a second dimension of replicas interpolating the penalty strengths. This
scheme ensures constraint satisfaction in the final replicas, analogous to
low-energy states at low temperature. The resulting two-dimensional parallel
tempering algorithm (2D-PT) improves mixing in heavily constrained replicas and
eliminates the need to explicitly tune the penalty strength. In a
representative example of graph sparsification with copy constraints, 2D-PT
achieves near-ideal mixing, with Kullback-Leibler divergence decaying as
O(1/t). When applied to sparsified Wishart instances, 2D-PT yields orders of
magnitude speedup over conventional PT with the same number of replicas. The
method applies broadly to constrained Ising problems and can be deployed on
existing Ising machines.

Motivation: 解决小规模临床数据集的稳定性和可解释性问题，同时探索高效应子群的发现方法。

Method: NetraAI结合收缩映射、信息几何和进化算法，通过伪时间嵌入和长程记忆探索特征交互，并引入LLM作为元进化层。

Result: 在精神分裂症、抑郁症和胰腺癌案例中，NetraAI显著提升模型性能（AUC从0.50-0.68提升至接近完美分类）。

Conclusion: NetraAI为动态系统、信息几何和进化学习的结合体，提供了可解释的自适应AI，加速临床发现。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved into an ecosystem of specialized
"species," each with unique strengths. We analyze two: DeepSeek-V3, a
671-billion-parameter Mixture of Experts large language model (LLM)
exemplifying scale-driven generality, and NetraAI, a dynamical system-based
framework engineered for stability and interpretability on small clinical trial
datasets. We formalize NetraAI's foundations, combining contraction mappings,
information geometry, and evolutionary algorithms to identify predictive
patient cohorts. Features are embedded in a metric space and iteratively
contracted toward stable attractors that define latent subgroups. A
pseudo-temporal embedding and long-range memory enable exploration of
higher-order feature interactions, while an internal evolutionary loop selects
compact, explainable 2-4-variable bundles ("Personas").
  To guide discovery, we introduce an LLM Strategist as a meta-evolutionary
layer that observes Persona outputs, prioritizes promising variables, injects
domain knowledge, and assesses robustness. This two-tier architecture mirrors
the human scientific process: NetraAI as experimentalist, the LLM as theorist,
forming a self-improving loop.
  In case studies (schizophrenia, depression, pancreatic cancer), NetraAI
uncovered small, high-effect-size subpopulations that transformed weak baseline
models (AUC ~0.50-0.68) into near-perfect classifiers using only a few
features. We position NetraAI at the intersection of dynamical systems,
information geometry, and evolutionary learning, aligned with emerging
concept-level reasoning paradigms such as LeCun's Joint Embedding Predictive
Architecture (JEPA). By prioritizing reliable, explainable knowledge, NetraAI
offers a new generation of adaptive, self-reflective AI to accelerate clinical
discovery.

Motivation: 探索神经网络损失景观中的特殊结构及其对优化和计算能力的影响。

Method: 通过分析梯度动态、几何结构和功能解释，识别和表征这些通道。

Result: 梯度流求解器在多种回归设置中高概率到达这些通道，最终形成门控线性单元。

Conclusion: 这些通道揭示了全连接层的计算能力，并提供了对损失景观中准平坦区域的全面理解。

Abstract: The loss landscapes of neural networks contain minima and saddle points that
may be connected in flat regions or appear in isolation. We identify and
characterize a special structure in the loss landscape: channels along which
the loss decreases extremely slowly, while the output weights of at least two
neurons, $a_i$ and $a_j$, diverge to $\pm$infinity, and their input weight
vectors, $\mathbf{w_i}$ and $\mathbf{w_j}$, become equal to each other. At
convergence, the two neurons implement a gated linear unit:
$a_i\sigma(\mathbf{w_i} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + a_j\sigma(\mathbf{w_j} \cdot
\mathbf{x}) \rightarrow \sigma(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + (\mathbf{v} \cdot
\mathbf{x}) \sigma'(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x})$. Geometrically, these
channels to infinity are asymptotically parallel to symmetry-induced lines of
critical points. Gradient flow solvers, and related optimization methods like
SGD or ADAM, reach the channels with high probability in diverse regression
settings, but without careful inspection they look like flat local minima with
finite parameter values. Our characterization provides a comprehensive picture
of these quasi-flat regions in terms of gradient dynamics, geometry, and
functional interpretation. The emergence of gated linear units at the end of
the channels highlights a surprising aspect of the computational capabilities
of fully connected layers.

Motivation: 解决非侵入性EEG在开放词汇场景下解码自然语言的挑战，传统方法因噪声和变异性表现不佳。

Method: 整合EEG与同步眼动追踪数据，用于开放词汇文本生成和情感分类任务。

Result: 在BLEU和Rouge分数上表现优异，情感分类F1分数提升10%，且能处理多源数据。

Conclusion: ETS框架在开放词汇EEG解码中具有高性能潜力。

Abstract: Decoding natural language from brain activity using non-invasive
electroencephalography (EEG) remains a significant challenge in neuroscience
and machine learning, particularly for open-vocabulary scenarios where
traditional methods struggle with noise and variability. Previous studies have
achieved high accuracy on small-closed vocabularies, but it still struggles on
open vocabularies. In this study, we propose ETS, a framework that integrates
EEG with synchronized eye-tracking data to address two critical tasks: (1)
open-vocabulary text generation and (2) sentiment classification of perceived
language. Our model achieves a superior performance on BLEU and Rouge score for
EEG-To-Text decoding and up to 10% F1 score on EEG-based ternary sentiment
classification, which significantly outperforms supervised baselines.
Furthermore, we show that our proposed model can handle data from various
subjects and sources, showing great potential for high performance open
vocabulary eeg-to-text system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统Ricci流求解器全局更新成本高和贪婪启发式方法收敛慢或调参困难的问题。

Method: 采用贪婪综合征解码步骤定位并修正最大曲率误差，辅以两个轻量级神经网络模块动态选择顶点和步长。

Result: 在110个SJTU-TMQA网格上，迭代次数减少2.4倍，曲率分布更紧，UV失真与MOS相关性达-0.93，单次迭代仅增加0.25毫秒。

Conclusion: MicroRicci适用于实时、资源受限的图形和仿真应用，具有高效、自适应和高精度的特点。

Abstract: Real-time mesh smoothing at scale remains a formidable challenge: classical
Ricci-flow solvers demand costly global updates, while greedy heuristics suffer
from slow convergence or brittle tuning. We present MicroRicci, the first truly
self-tuning, local Ricci-flow solver that borrows ideas from coding theory and
packs them into just 1K + 200 parameters. Its primary core is a greedy
syndrome-decoding step that pinpoints and corrects the largest curvature error
in O(E) time, augmented by two tiny neural modules that adaptively choose
vertices and step sizes on the fly. On a diverse set of 110 SJTU-TMQA meshes,
MicroRicci slashes iteration counts from 950+=140 to 400+=80 (2.4x speedup),
tightens curvature spread from 0.19 to 0.185, and achieves a remarkable
UV-distortion-to-MOS correlation of r = -0.93. It adds only 0.25 ms per
iteration (0.80 to 1.05 ms), yielding an end-to-end 1.8x runtime acceleration
over state-of-the-art methods. MicroRicci's combination of linear-time updates,
automatic hyperparameter adaptation, and high-quality geometric and perceptual
results makes it well suited for real-time, resource-limited applications in
graphics, simulation, and related fields.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在训练高精度神经网络时，常忽视L∞误差，且非凸优化和超参数调优困难。

Result: 在多个基准问题上验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: HiPreNets框架显著提升了神经网络的整体精度，尤其在L∞误差方面表现优异。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are powerful tools for solving nonlinear problems in
science and engineering, but training highly accurate models becomes
challenging as problem complexity increases. Non-convex optimization and
numerous hyperparameters to tune make performance improvement difficult, and
traditional approaches often prioritize minimizing mean squared error (MSE)
while overlooking $L^{\infty}$ error, which is the critical focus in many
applications. To address these challenges, we present a progressive framework
for training and tuning high-precision neural networks (HiPreNets). Our
approach refines a previously explored staged training technique for neural
networks that improves an existing fully connected neural network by
sequentially learning its prediction residuals using additional networks,
leading to improved overall accuracy. We discuss how to take advantage of the
structure of the residuals to guide the choice of loss function, number of
parameters to use, and ways to introduce adaptive data sampling techniques. We
validate our framework's effectiveness through several benchmark problems.

Result: 方法在数据分布变化、领域扩展和任务更新方面表现良好，但对噪声数据的适应性较差。

Conclusion: 迁移学习方法在流动参数预测中具有潜力，尤其在适应变化的数据分布和任务更新方面，但需进一步优化噪声数据处理。

Abstract: Determining onflow parameters is crucial from the perspectives of wind tunnel
testing and regular flight and wind turbine operations. These parameters have
traditionally been predicted via direct measurements which might lead to
challenges in case of sensor faults. Alternatively, a data-driven prediction
model based on surface pressure data can be used to determine these parameters.
It is essential that such predictors achieve close to real-time learning as
dictated by practical applications such as monitoring wind tunnel operations or
learning the variations in aerodynamic performance of aerospace and wind energy
systems. To overcome the challenges caused by changes in the data distribution
as well as in adapting to a new prediction task, we propose a transfer learning
methodology to predict the onflow parameters, specifically angle of attack and
onflow speed. It requires first training a convolutional neural network
(ConvNet) model offline for the core prediction task, then freezing the weights
of this model except the selected layers preceding the output node, and finally
executing transfer learning by retraining these layers. A demonstration of this
approach is provided using steady CFD analysis data for an airfoil for i)
domain adaptation where transfer learning is performed with data from a target
domain having different data distribution than the source domain and ii) task
adaptation where the prediction task is changed. Further exploration on the
influence of noisy data, performance on an extended domain, and trade studies
varying sampling sizes and architectures are provided. Results successfully
demonstrate the potential of the approach for adaptation to changing data
distribution, domain extension, and task update while the application for noisy
data is concluded to be not as effective.

Conclusion: PIPE通过嵌入物理信息，显著提升了多模态时间序列预测的准确性。

Abstract: Multimodal time series forecasting is foundational in various fields, such as
utilizing satellite imagery and numerical data for predicting typhoons in
climate science. However, existing multimodal approaches primarily focus on
utilizing text data to help time series forecasting, leaving the visual data in
existing time series datasets untouched. Furthermore, it is challenging for
models to effectively capture the physical information embedded in visual data,
such as satellite imagery's temporal and geospatial context, which extends
beyond images themselves. To address this gap, we propose physics-informed
positional encoding (PIPE), a lightweight method that embeds physical
information into vision language models (VLMs). PIPE introduces two key
innovations: (1) a physics-informed positional indexing scheme for mapping
physics to positional IDs, and (2) a variant-frequency positional encoding
mechanism for encoding frequency information of physical variables and
sequential order of tokens within the embedding space. By preserving both the
physical information and sequential order information, PIPE significantly
improves multimodal alignment and forecasting accuracy. Through the experiments
on the most representative and the largest open-sourced satellite image
dataset, PIPE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both deep learning
forecasting and climate domain methods, demonstrating superiority across
benchmarks, including a 12% improvement in typhoon intensity forecasting over
prior works. Our code is provided in the supplementary material.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了多深度存储系统的检索问题，并具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: In modern industrial and logistics environments, the rapid expansion of fast
delivery services has heightened the demand for storage systems that combine
high efficiency with increased density. Multi-deep autonomous vehicle storage
and retrieval systems (AVS/RS) present a viable solution for achieving greater
storage density. However, these systems encounter significant challenges during
retrieval operations due to lane blockages. A conventional approach to mitigate
this issue involves storing items with homogeneous characteristics in a single
lane, but this strategy restricts the flexibility and adaptability of
multi-deep storage systems.
  In this study, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based framework to
address the retrieval problem in multi-deep storage systems with heterogeneous
item configurations. Each item is associated with a specific due date, and the
objective is to minimize total tardiness. To effectively capture the system's
topology, we introduce a graph-based state representation that integrates both
item attributes and the local topological structure of the multi-deep
warehouse. To process this representation, we design a novel neural network
architecture that combines a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a Transformer
model. The GNN encodes topological and item-specific information into
embeddings for all directly accessible items, while the Transformer maps these
embeddings into global priority assignments. The Transformer's strong
generalization capability further allows our approach to be applied to storage
systems with diverse layouts. Extensive numerical experiments, including
comparisons with heuristic methods, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
neural network architecture and the effectiveness of the trained agent in
optimizing retrieval tardiness.

Abstract: High quality real world datasets are essential for advancing data driven
approaches in type 1 diabetes (T1D) management, including personalized therapy

in this area has been limited by the scarcity of publicly available datasets

over 6 to 8 weeks for each patient. Notably, the dataset provides granular
details on bolus insulin delivery (i.e., total dose, bolus type, correction
specific amounts) features that are rarely found in existing datasets. By
offering rich, naturalistic data, AZT1D supports a wide range of artificial
intelligence and machine learning applications aimed at improving clinical
decision making and individualized care in T1D.

Motivation: 重复概念漂移是时间序列中常见的问题，现有方法通过参数更新延迟遗忘，但可能导致部分知识丢失且缺乏知识保留机制。CEP旨在保留所有概念知识并在概念重现时充分利用。

Method: CEP通过存储不同概念的预测器实例，选择最接近测试样本的预测器并学习其邻近样本特征（检索）。若邻近样本不足，则从当前最近样本演化新模型存储新概念知识，同时清除过时知识。

Result: 在不同架构模型和八个真实数据集上的实验表明，CEP能有效保留不同概念知识，在重复概念场景下显著提升预测效果。

Conclusion: CEP通过动态存储和更新知识，解决了重复概念漂移问题，显著提升了在线预测的准确性。

Abstract: Recurring concept drift, a type of concept drift in which previously observed
data patterns reappear after some time, is one of the most prevalent types of
concept drift in time series. As time progresses, concept drift occurs and
previously encountered concepts are forgotten, thereby leading to a decline in
the accuracy of online predictions. Existing solutions employ parameter
updating techniques to delay forgetting; however, this may result in the loss
of some previously learned knowledge while neglecting the exploration of
knowledge retention mechanisms. To retain all conceptual knowledge and fully
utilize it when the concepts recur, we propose the Continuous Evolution Pool
(CEP), a pooling mechanism that stores different instances of forecasters for
different concepts. Our method first selects the forecaster nearest to the test
sample and then learns the features from its neighboring samples - a process we
refer to as the retrieval. If there are insufficient neighboring samples, it
indicates that a new concept has emerged, and a new model will evolve from the
current nearest sample to the pool to store the knowledge of the concept.
Simultaneously, the elimination mechanism will enable outdated knowledge to be
cleared to ensure the prediction effect of the forecasters. Experiments on
different architectural models and eight real datasets demonstrate that CEP
effectively retains the knowledge of different concepts. In the scenario of
online forecasting with recurring concepts, CEP significantly enhances the
prediction results.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在蛋白质语言模型（PLM）的推理阶段注入dropout层，无需重新训练即可提升零样本预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何在不重新训练或微调PLM的情况下，通过简单方法提升其零样本预测能力。

Method: 在PLM的特征提取层和Transformer层之间注入dropout层，并通过类似蒙特卡洛dropout的方式平均输出。

Result: 在ProteinGym数据集子集上，零样本性能显著提升，0.1的dropout率表现最佳。

Conclusion: 推理阶段注入dropout是一种简单有效的方法，可提升PLM的零样本预测性能。

Abstract: Protein Language Models (PLMs) such as ESM2 have been shown to be capable of
zero-shot prediction of critical scalar properties of proteins (fitness). In
this work, we show that injecting a dropout layer at inference time between a
PLM's featurizer/embedding layer and its transformer, and averaging its output
akin to Monte-Carlo dropout increases zero-shot performance on a subset of the
ProteinGym dataset. This is the case even when the model was not trained with
dropouts to begin with, and does not require retraining or finetuning of the
PLM. A dropout of 0.1 seems performant across all models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为“Assembly-of-Experts”（AoE）的新方法，用于高效生成混合专家模型的子模型，显著降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型预训练的计算成本极高（$10^{13}$-$10^{15}$ FLOPs），效率低下，希望通过AoE方法更好地利用预训练模型的资源。

Method: 通过线性时间内对父模型的权重张量进行插值，增强或抑制语义特征，生成功能强大的子模型。

Result: 生成的子模型（如DeepSeek R1T "Chimera"）在保持父模型智能水平的同时，显著减少了输出标记数量（约40%），推理更紧凑有序。

Conclusion: AoE方法无需微调或蒸馏即可高效生成高性能子模型，为模型空间探索提供了简单直接的途径。

Abstract: Requiring $10^{13}$-$10^{15}$ FLOPs to calculate one 8 bit weight in an LLM
during pretraining is extremely expensive and seems inefficient. To better
leverage the huge investments made into pretrained models, we develop the new
"Assembly-of-Experts" (AoE) construction method to create capable child
variants of existing Mixture-of-Experts parent models in linear time. Model
weight tensors get interpolated individually, allowing to enhance or suppress
semantic features of the parents.
  Varying the proportion of weights taken from the parent models, we observe
some properties of the AoE child model changing gradually, while other
behavioral traits emerge with a sharp transition. Surprisingly, nearly every
generated model is functional and capable, which makes searching the model
space straightforward.
  We construct the DeepSeek R1T "Chimera", a 671B open-weights hybrid model
combining DeepSeek's V3-0324 and R1 model variants. The child inherits only the
routed expert tensors of R1, but still achieves about R1-level intelligence. At
the same time, it uses about 40\% fewer output tokens, close to V3 speed.
Constructed without any fine-tuning or distillation, the Chimera exhibits
surprisingly compact, orderly reasoning compared to its parent models.

Motivation: 研究智能系统如何在支持广泛泛化的同时保持输入身份的选择性，揭示这种权衡的基本限制。

Method: 通过理论推导和实验验证，分析了表征相似性衰减对泛化和识别概率的影响，并在不同模型中进行验证。

Result: 发现泛化与识别概率受限于普适的Pareto前沿，且复杂模型中同样存在这种限制。

Conclusion: 研究提供了泛化与识别权衡的精确理论，揭示了语义分辨率对深度网络和大脑表征能力的影响。

Abstract: Intelligent systems must deploy internal representations that are
simultaneously structured -- to support broad generalization -- and selective
-- to preserve input identity. We expose a fundamental limit on this tradeoff.
For any model whose representational similarity between inputs decays with
finite semantic resolution $\varepsilon$, we derive closed-form expressions
that pin its probability of correct generalization $p_S$ and identification
$p_I$ to a universal Pareto front independent of input space geometry.
Extending the analysis to noisy, heterogeneous spaces and to $n>2$ inputs
predicts a sharp $1/n$ collapse of multi-input processing capacity and a
non-monotonic optimum for $p_S$. A minimal ReLU network trained end-to-end
reproduces these laws: during learning a resolution boundary self-organizes and
empirical $(p_S,p_I)$ trajectories closely follow theoretical curves for
linearly decaying similarity. Finally, we demonstrate that the same limits
persist in two markedly more complex settings -- a convolutional neural network
and state-of-the-art vision-language models -- confirming that
finite-resolution similarity is a fundamental emergent informational
constraint, not merely a toy-model artifact. Together, these results provide an
exact theory of the generalization-identification trade-off and clarify how
semantic resolution shapes the representational capacity of deep networks and
brains alike.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer架构在时间序列预测中存在计算复杂度高的问题，ss-Mamba旨在提供一种高效且性能相当的替代方案。

Method: 采用Mamba选择性状态空间模型，结合语义索引嵌入和样条KAN网络，动态捕获复杂时间特征。

Result: 实验证明ss-Mamba在准确性、鲁棒性和可解释性上优于传统Transformer模型，计算复杂度从二次降至线性。

Conclusion: ss-Mamba是一种高效、多功能的时间序列预测模型，有望替代传统Transformer架构。

Abstract: We propose ss-Mamba, a novel foundation model that enhances time series
forecasting by integrating semantic-aware embeddings and adaptive spline-based
temporal encoding within a selective state-space modeling framework. Building
upon the recent success of Transformer architectures, ss-Mamba adopts the Mamba
selective state space model as an efficient alternative that achieves
comparable performance while significantly reducing computational complexity
from quadratic to linear time. Semantic index embeddings, initialized from
pretrained language models, allow effective generalization to previously unseen
series through meaningful semantic priors. Additionally, spline-based
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) dynamically and interpretably capture complex
seasonalities and non-stationary temporal effects, providing a powerful
enhancement over conventional temporal feature encodings. Extensive
experimental evaluations confirm that ss-Mamba delivers superior accuracy,
robustness, and interpretability, demonstrating its capability as a versatile
and computationally efficient alternative to traditional Transformer-based
models in time-series forecasting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管动量在梯度优化方法中至关重要，但离散动力学与连续时间近似之间的离散化误差尚未被充分研究。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 设计了一阶分段连续微分方程，通过添加反项显式处理离散化误差，实现对步长任意阶误差的控制。

Conclusion: 理论结果通过数值实验验证，为深度学习中的优化方法提供了新的理论工具。

Abstract: This paper establishes a continuous time approximation, a piece-wise
continuous differential equation, for the discrete Heavy-Ball (HB) momentum
method with explicit discretization error. Investigating continuous
differential equations has been a promising approach for studying the discrete
optimization methods. Despite the crucial role of momentum in gradient-based
optimization methods, the gap between the original discrete dynamics and the
continuous time approximations due to the discretization error has not been
comprehensively bridged yet. In this work, we study the HB momentum method in
continuous time while putting more focus on the discretization error to provide
additional theoretical tools to this area. In particular, we design a
first-order piece-wise continuous differential equation, where we add a number
of counter terms to account for the discretization error explicitly. As a
result, we provide a continuous time model for the HB momentum method that
allows the control of discretization error to arbitrary order of the step size.
As an application, we leverage it to find a new implicit regularization of the
directional smoothness and investigate the implicit bias of HB for diagonal
linear networks, indicating how our results can be used in deep learning. Our
theoretical findings are further supported by numerical experiments.

Motivation: VLMs结合了视觉模态和大型语言模型（LLMs），而LLMs对提示词敏感，因此需要研究VLMs是否继承这种敏感性。

Method: 提出PARC框架，包括（1）语言和视觉领域的合理提示词变化，（2）带有保证的新型模型可靠性评分，（3）校准步骤以支持跨数据集和提示词的分析。

Result: VLMs在视觉领域对提示词的敏感性与LLMs类似，InternVL2家族模型表现最稳健，且提示词敏感性与训练数据相关。

Conclusion: PARC框架有效分析了VLMs的提示词敏感性，为模型选择和优化提供了依据。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) respond to user-crafted text prompts and visual
inputs, and are applied to numerous real-world problems. VLMs integrate visual
modalities with large language models (LLMs), which are well known to be
prompt-sensitive. Hence, it is crucial to determine whether VLMs inherit this
instability to varying prompts. We therefore investigate which prompt
variations VLMs are most sensitive to and which VLMs are most agnostic to
prompt variations. To this end, we introduce PARC (Prompt Analysis via
Reliability and Calibration), a VLM prompt sensitivity analysis framework built
on three pillars: (1) plausible prompt variations in both the language and
vision domain, (2) a novel model reliability score with built-in guarantees,
and (3) a calibration step that enables dataset- and prompt-spanning prompt
variation analysis. Regarding prompt variations, PARC's evaluation shows that
VLMs mirror LLM language prompt sensitivity in the vision domain, and most
destructive variations change the expected answer. Regarding models,
outstandingly robust VLMs among 22 evaluated models come from the InternVL2
family. We further find indications that prompt sensitivity is linked to
training data. The code will be at https://github.com/NVlabs/PARC.

Method: 采用Model-Router框架，动态选择适合不同需求模式（平滑、块状或间歇性）的预测模型，包括经典方法、机器学习和深度学习方法。

Result: 在大规模Favorita数据集上，深度学习路由器（InceptionTime）比单一模型基准提升了11.8%的预测精度（NWRMSLE），推理时间快4.67倍。

Conclusion: 该框架显著减少了缺货和库存浪费，展示了智能自适应AI在优化供应链中的关键作用。

Abstract: Sparse and intermittent demand forecasting in supply chains presents a
critical challenge, as frequent zero-demand periods hinder traditional model
accuracy and impact inventory management. We propose and evaluate a
Model-Router framework that dynamically selects the most suitable forecasting
model-spanning classical, ML, and DL methods for each product based on its
unique demand pattern. By comparing rule-based, LightGBM, and InceptionTime
routers, our approach learns to assign appropriate forecasting strategies,
effectively differentiating between smooth, lumpy, or intermittent demand
regimes to optimize predictions. Experiments on the large-scale Favorita
dataset show our deep learning (Inception Time) router improves forecasting
accuracy by up to 11.8% (NWRMSLE) over strong, single-model benchmarks with
4.67x faster inference time. Ultimately, these gains in forecasting precision
will drive substantial reductions in both stockouts and wasteful excess
inventory, underscoring the critical role of intelligent, adaptive Al in
optimizing contemporary supply chain operations.

sacrifice plasticity to scale. Experiments conducted in benchmark continuous
control and visual problems reveal that the proposed approach achieves greater
knowledge transfer and performance than alternative methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于3D光学图像生物标志物的半监督学习模型（$p$-Laplacian回归模型），用于预测人体成分变量（如ALM、BFP、BMD），以替代昂贵的DXA扫描。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DXA扫描成本高且耗时，而传统监督学习算法需要大量数据，但医疗数据获取面临技术和法律限制。因此，需要一种在数据受限环境下仍能有效预测的方法。

Method: 使用847名患者的数据，应用统计和机器学习模型（包括$p$-Laplacian回归模型和SVR等监督算法）对3D光学图像提取的生物标志物进行预测。

Result: $p$-Laplacian模型在仅10%训练数据时，对ALM、BMD、BFP的预测误差分别为13%、10%、20%；SVR在80%数据时对ALM和BMD的误差为8%，对BFP为11%。

Conclusion: $p$-Laplacian模型在数据受限的医疗应用中具有潜力，可作为DXA扫描的替代方案。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of anthropometric body composition variables, such as
Appendicular Lean Mass (ALM), Body Fat Percentage (BFP), and Bone Mineral
Density (BMD), is essential for early diagnosis of several chronic diseases.
Currently, researchers rely on Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scans to
measure these metrics; however, DXA scans are costly and time-consuming. This
work proposes an alternative to DXA scans by applying statistical and machine
learning models on biomarkers (height, volume, left calf circumference, etc)
obtained from 3D optical images. The dataset consists of 847 patients and was
sourced from Pennington Biomedical Research Center. Extracting patients' data
in healthcare faces many technical challenges and legal restrictions. However,
most supervised machine learning algorithms are inherently data-intensive,
requiring a large amount of training data. To overcome these limitations, we
implemented a semi-supervised model, the $p$-Laplacian regression model. This
paper is the first to demonstrate the application of a $p$-Laplacian model for
regression. Our $p$-Laplacian model yielded errors of $\sim13\%$ for ALM,
$\sim10\%$ for BMD, and $\sim20\%$ for BFP when the training data accounted for
10 percent of all data. Among the supervised algorithms we implemented, Support
Vector Regression (SVR) performed the best for ALM and BMD, yielding errors of
$\sim 8\%$ for both, while Least Squares SVR performed the best for BFP with
$\sim 11\%$ error when trained on 80 percent of the data. Our findings position
the $p$-Laplacian model as a promising tool for healthcare applications,
particularly in a data-constrained environment.

Abstract: Despite tremendous recent advances in large model reasoning ability,
vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle with detailed visual reasoning,
especially when compute resources are limited. To address this challenge, we
draw inspiration from methods like Deepseek-r1 for VLMs and train smaller-scale
models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to use external tools
such as zoom. The greatest benefit is obtained with a combination of GRPO
learning, a simple reward structure, a simplified tool-calling interface,
allocating additional tokens to the result of the tool call, and a training
data mix that over-represents visually difficult examples. Compared to
similarly-sized baseline models, our method achieves better performance on some
visual question-answering (VQA) tasks, thanks to the detailed visual
information gathered from the external tool.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在现实场景中面临分布式数据和隐私要求的挑战，现有联邦学习方法无法适应其大规模和通信需求。

Method: FedNano通过NanoEdge模块（包含模态特定编码器、连接器和低秩适配器）实现客户端轻量化，仅传输NanoAdapter更新，减少存储和通信开销。

Result: 实验表明，FedNano显著优于现有联邦学习方法，客户端存储减少95%，通信开销仅占模型参数的0.01%。

Conclusion: FedNano为多模态AI系统的可扩展和去中心化部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in tasks like multimodal
reasoning and cross-modal retrieval but face deployment challenges in
real-world scenarios due to distributed multimodal data and strict privacy
requirements. Federated Learning (FL) offers a solution by enabling
collaborative model training without centralizing data. However, realizing FL
for MLLMs presents significant challenges, including high computational
demands, limited client capacity, substantial communication costs, and
heterogeneous client data. Existing FL methods assume client-side deployment of
full models, an assumption that breaks down for large-scale MLLMs due to their
massive size and communication demands. To address these limitations, we
propose FedNano, the first FL framework that centralizes the LLM on the server
while introducing NanoEdge, a lightweight module for client-specific
adaptation. NanoEdge employs modality-specific encoders, connectors, and
trainable NanoAdapters with low-rank adaptation. This design eliminates the
need to deploy LLM on clients, reducing client-side storage by 95%, and
limiting communication overhead to only 0.01% of the model parameters. By
transmitting only compact NanoAdapter updates, FedNano handles heterogeneous
client data and resource constraints while preserving privacy. Experiments
demonstrate that FedNano outperforms prior FL baselines, bridging the gap
between MLLM scale and FL feasibility, and enabling scalable, decentralized
multimodal AI systems.

Abstract: Surrogate modeling techniques have become indispensable in accelerating the

This study systematically evaluates the fitting performance of four prominent
surrogate models conventional Gaussian Processes(cGP), Deep Gaussian
Processes(DGP), encoder-decoder neural networks for multi-output regression and
XGBoost applied to a hybrid dataset of experimental and computational
properties in the AlCoCrCuFeMnNiV HEA system. We specifically assess their
capabilities in predicting correlated material properties, including yield
strength, hardness, modulus, ultimate tensile strength, elongation, and average
hardness under dynamic and quasi-static conditions, alongside auxiliary
computational properties. The comparison highlights the strengths of
hierarchical and deep modeling approaches in handling heteroscedastic,
heterotopic, and incomplete data commonly encountered in materials informatics.
Our findings illustrate that DGP infused with machine learning-based prior
outperform other surrogates by effectively capturing inter-property
correlations and input-dependent uncertainty. This enhanced predictive accuracy
positions advanced surrogate models as powerful tools for robust and
data-efficient materials design.

Abstract: Aiming at the critical role of SSD health state prediction in data
reliability assurance, this study proposes a hybrid BiGRU-MHA model that
incorporates a multi-head attention mechanism to enhance the accuracy and
stability of storage device health classification. The model innovatively
integrates temporal feature extraction and key information focusing
capabilities. Specifically, it leverages the bidirectional timing modeling
advantages of the BiGRU network to capture both forward and backward
dependencies of SSD degradation features. Simultaneously, the multi-head
attention mechanism dynamically assigns feature weights, improving the model's
sensitivity to critical health indicators. Experimental results show that the
proposed model achieves classification accuracies of 92.70% on the training set
and 92.44% on the test set, with a minimal performance gap of only 0.26%,
demonstrating excellent generalization ability. Further analysis using the
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve shows an area under the curve
(AUC) of 0.94 on the test set, confirming the model's robust binary
classification performance. This work not only presents a new technical
approach for SSD health prediction but also addresses the generalization
bottleneck of traditional models, offering a verifiable method with practical
value for preventive maintenance of industrial-grade storage systems. The
results show the model can significantly reduce data loss risks by providing
early failure warnings and help optimize maintenance costs, supporting
intelligent decision-making in building reliable storage systems for cloud
computing data centers and edge storage environments.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is used to tackle various tasks, such as disease
classification and prediction. The effectiveness of ML models relies heavily on
having large amounts of complete data. However, healthcare data is often
limited or incomplete, which can hinder model performance. Additionally, issues
like the trustworthiness of solutions vary with the datasets used. The lack of
transparency in some ML models further complicates their understanding and use.
In healthcare, particularly in the case of Age-related Macular Degeneration
(AMD), which affects millions of older adults, early diagnosis is crucial due
to the absence of effective treatments for reversing progression. Diagnosing
AMD involves assessing retinal images along with patients' symptom reports.
There is a need for classification approaches that consider genetic, dietary,
clinical, and demographic factors. Recently, we introduced the -Comprehensive
Abstraction and Classification Tool for Uncovering Structures-(CACTUS), aimed
at improving AMD stage classification. CACTUS offers explainability and
flexibility, outperforming standard ML models. It enhances decision-making by
identifying key factors and providing confidence in its results. The important
features identified by CACTUS allow us to compare with existing medical
knowledge. By eliminating less relevant or biased data, we created a clinical
scenario for clinicians to offer feedback and address biases.

### [148] [Generalized Reference Kernel With Negative Samples For Support Vector One-class Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14895)
*Jenni Raitoharju*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的GRKneg方法用于OC-SVM，通过利用少量负样本优化核函数，显著提升了小规模单类分类的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小规模单类分类问题中负样本有限时的性能优化需求。

Method: 提出GRKneg方法，改进OC-SVM的核函数，利用负样本优化参考向量选择。

Result: GRKneg在负样本较少时优于标准OC-SVM和二元SVM。

Conclusion: GRKneg在小规模单类分类中表现优异，尤其在负样本稀缺时效果显著。

Abstract: This paper focuses on small-scale one-class classification with some negative
samples available. We propose Generalized Reference Kernel with Negative
Samples (GRKneg) for One-class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM). We study
different ways to select/generate the reference vectors and recommend an
approach for the problem at hand. It is worth noting that the proposed method
does not use any labels in the model optimization but uses the original OC-SVM
implementation. Only the kernel used in the process is improved using the
negative data. We compare our method with the standard OC-SVM and with the
binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) using different amounts of negative
samples. Our approach consistently outperforms the standard OC-SVM using Radial
Basis Function kernel. When there are plenty of negative samples, the binary
SVM outperforms the one-class approaches as expected, but we show that for the
lowest numbers of negative samples the proposed approach clearly outperforms
the binary SVM.

*Ganyu Wang,Boyu Wang,Bin Gu,Charles Ling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种事件驱动的在线垂直联邦学习（VFL）框架，解决了数据异步到达和非凸模型在非平稳环境中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线学习在VFL中更具适应性，但数据异步到达和非凸模型问题被以往研究忽视。

Method: 提出事件驱动的在线VFL框架，仅激活部分客户端，并引入动态局部遗憾（DLR）处理非凸和非平稳问题。

Result: 实验表明该框架在非平稳数据下更稳定，显著降低了通信和计算成本。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了在线VFL中的关键挑战，提升了性能和效率。

Abstract: Online learning is more adaptable to real-world scenarios in Vertical
Federated Learning (VFL) compared to offline learning. However, integrating
online learning into VFL presents challenges due to the unique nature of VFL,
where clients possess non-intersecting feature sets for the same sample. In
real-world scenarios, the clients may not receive data streaming for the
disjoint features for the same entity synchronously. Instead, the data are
typically generated by an \emph{event} relevant to only a subset of clients. We
are the first to identify these challenges in online VFL, which have been
overlooked by previous research. To address these challenges, we proposed an
event-driven online VFL framework. In this framework, only a subset of clients
were activated during each event, while the remaining clients passively
collaborated in the learning process. Furthermore, we incorporated
\emph{dynamic local regret (DLR)} into VFL to address the challenges posed by
online learning problems with non-convex models within a non-stationary
environment. We conducted a comprehensive regret analysis of our proposed
framework, specifically examining the DLR under non-convex conditions with
event-driven online VFL. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our proposed
framework was more stable than the existing online VFL framework under
non-stationary data conditions while also significantly reducing communication
and computation costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦黑盒提示调优方法忽视了云端LLM服务的高查询成本，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出FedOne框架，通过理论分析证明每轮仅激活一个客户端（FedOne策略）能实现最优查询效率，并进行了数值实验验证。

Result: 实验结果显示FedOne显著提升了查询效率，与理论分析一致。

Conclusion: FedOne是一种高效的联邦黑盒离散提示学习方法，适用于云端LLM交互场景。

Abstract: Black-Box Discrete Prompt Learning is a prompt-tuning method that optimizes
discrete prompts without accessing model parameters or gradients, making the
prompt tuning on a cloud-based Large Language Model (LLM) feasible. Adapting
federated learning to BDPL could further enhance prompt tuning performance by
leveraging data from diverse sources. However, all previous research on
federated black-box prompt tuning had neglected the substantial query cost
associated with the cloud-based LLM service. To address this gap, we conducted
a theoretical analysis of query efficiency within the context of federated
black-box prompt tuning. Our findings revealed that degrading FedAvg to
activate only one client per round, a strategy we called \textit{FedOne},
enabled optimal query efficiency in federated black-box prompt learning.
Building on this insight, we proposed the FedOne framework, a federated
black-box discrete prompt learning method designed to maximize query efficiency
when interacting with cloud-based LLMs. We conducted numerical experiments on
various aspects of our framework, demonstrating a significant improvement in
query efficiency, which aligns with our theoretical results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于自编码器在异常检测中使用的重建误差阈值非标准化且直接影响检测性能，因此需要一种自动定义阈值的方法。

Method: 评估了三种机器学习算法（K-最近邻、K-均值和支持向量机）来自动定义重建误差阈值。

Result: 未明确提及具体结果，但通过算法评估提出了解决方案。

Conclusion: 自动定义阈值的方法有望提升异常检测系统的性能。

Abstract: Currently, digital security mechanisms like Anomaly Detection Systems using
Autoencoders (AE) show great potential for bypassing problems intrinsic to the
data, such as data imbalance. Because AE use a non-trivial and nonstandardized
separation threshold to classify the extracted reconstruction error, the
definition of this threshold directly impacts the performance of the detection
process. Thus, this work proposes the automatic definition of this threshold
using some machine learning algorithms. For this, three algorithms were
evaluated: the K-Nearst Neighbors, the K-Means and the Support Vector Machine.

Conclusion: 研究为开发更稳健可靠的规划策略提供了指导，明确了理想模型行为的具体场景。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted as the cognitive
core of embodied agents. However, inherited hallucinations, which stem from
failures to ground user instructions in the observed physical environment, can
lead to navigation errors, such as searching for a refrigerator that does not
exist. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of hallucinations
in LLM-based embodied agents performing long-horizon tasks under scene-task
inconsistencies. Our goal is to understand to what extent hallucinations occur,
what types of inconsistencies trigger them, and how current models respond. To
achieve these goals, we construct a hallucination probing set by building on an
existing benchmark, capable of inducing hallucination rates up to 40x higher
than base prompts. Evaluating 12 models across two simulation environments, we
find that while models exhibit reasoning, they fail to resolve scene-task
inconsistencies-highlighting fundamental limitations in handling infeasible
tasks. We also provide actionable insights on ideal model behavior for each
scenario, offering guidance for developing more robust and reliable planning
strategies.

Motivation: 当前强化学习在大型语言模型（LLM）推理中的应用主要集中在数学和代码领域，缺乏对其他推理领域的广泛研究。

Method: 构建了Guru语料库，包含六个领域的示例，并通过领域特定的奖励设计、去重和过滤确保其可靠性。基于Guru，重新审视了RL在LLM推理中的表现。

Result: 研究发现，RL在不同领域的表现差异显著：常见领域（如数学、代码）可通过跨领域训练受益，而罕见领域（如逻辑、模拟）需领域内训练才能提升性能。Guru-7B和Guru-32B模型在公开数据训练的模型中表现最佳。

Conclusion: RL不仅能激发预训练模型的知识，还能促进新技能的获取。Guru语料库和模型为通用推理研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach to improve
large language model (LLM) reasoning, yet most open efforts focus narrowly on
math and code, limiting our understanding of its broader applicability to
general reasoning. A key challenge lies in the lack of reliable, scalable RL
reward signals across diverse reasoning domains. We introduce Guru, a curated
RL reasoning corpus of 92K verifiable examples spanning six reasoning
domains--Math, Code, Science, Logic, Simulation, and Tabular--each built
through domain-specific reward design, deduplication, and filtering to ensure
reliability and effectiveness for RL training. Based on Guru, we systematically
revisit established findings in RL for LLM reasoning and observe significant
variation across domains. For example, while prior work suggests that RL
primarily elicits existing knowledge from pretrained models, our results reveal
a more nuanced pattern: domains frequently seen during pretraining (Math, Code,
Science) easily benefit from cross-domain RL training, while domains with
limited pretraining exposure (Logic, Simulation, and Tabular) require in-domain
training to achieve meaningful performance gains, suggesting that RL is likely
to facilitate genuine skill acquisition. Finally, we present Guru-7B and
Guru-32B, two models that achieve state-of-the-art performance among open
models RL-trained with publicly available data, outperforming best baselines by
7.9% and 6.7% on our 17-task evaluation suite across six reasoning domains. We
also show that our models effectively improve the Pass@k performance of their
base models, particularly on complex tasks less likely to appear in pretraining
data. We release data, models, training and evaluation code to facilitate
general-purpose reasoning at: https://github.com/LLM360/Reasoning360

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的误差估计方法（ODD），用于解决现有方法（DIS²）在源域和目标域重叠区域的竞争问题，从而更准确地预测目标域性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法DIS²在估计ML模型在未见目标域的误差时，存在源域和目标域重叠区域的竞争问题，导致误差估计不够准确。

Method: 提出Overlap-aware Disagreement Discrepancy（ODD），通过仅在非重叠目标域最大化分歧，避免竞争，并使用域分类器估计域重叠。

Result: 实验表明，ODD在多种基准测试中优于DIS²，提高了性能估计的准确性，同时保持有效性和可靠性。

Conclusion: ODD方法通过避免重叠区域的竞争，显著提升了目标域误差估计的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Reliable and accurate estimation of the error of an ML model in unseen test
domains is an important problem for safe intelligent systems. Prior work uses
disagreement discrepancy (DIS^2) to derive practical error bounds under
distribution shifts. It optimizes for a maximally disagreeing classifier on the
target domain to bound the error of a given source classifier. Although this
approach offers a reliable and competitively accurate estimate of the target
error, we identify a problem in this approach which causes the disagreement
discrepancy objective to compete in the overlapping region between source and
target domains. With an intuitive assumption that the target disagreement
should be no more than the source disagreement in the overlapping region due to
high enough support, we devise Overlap-aware Disagreement Discrepancy (ODD).
Maximizing ODD only requires disagreement in the non-overlapping target domain,
removing the competition. Our ODD-based bound uses domain-classifiers to
estimate domain-overlap and better predicts target performance than DIS^2. We
conduct experiments on a wide array of benchmarks to show that our method
improves the overall performance-estimation error while remaining valid and
reliable. Our code and results are available on GitHub.

Motivation: 早期预测多发性硬化症的残疾进展具有挑战性，因为疾病异质性高。研究旨在利用临床和数字化数据提升预测准确性。

Method: 使用最先进的表格和时间序列基础模型（FMs）、自定义多模态注意力变换器及机器学习方法，整合临床和数字化数据。

Result: 尽管早期预测困难（AUROC 0.63），但通过先进模型整合数字化数据提升了性能。多模态变换器表现最佳，优于单模态。

Conclusion: 研究展示了基础模型和多模态方法在从复杂临床和数字化数据中提取预测信号的潜力，有望为MS及其他复杂疾病提供更准确的预后。

Abstract: Early multiple sclerosis (MS) disability progression prediction is
challenging due to disease heterogeneity. This work predicts 48- and 72-week
disability using sparse baseline clinical data and 12 weeks of daily digital
Floodlight data from the CONSONANCE clinical trial. We employed
state-of-the-art tabular and time-series foundation models (FMs), a custom
multimodal attention-based transformer, and machine learning methods. Despite
the difficulty of early prediction (AUROC 0.63), integrating digital data via
advanced models improved performance over clinical data alone. A transformer
model using unimodal embeddings from the Moment FM yielded the best result, but
our multimodal transformer consistently outperformed its unimodal counterpart,
confirming the advantages of combining clinical with digital data. Our findings
demonstrate the promise of FMs and multimodal approaches to extract predictive
signals from complex and diverse clinical and digital life sciences data (e.g.,
imaging, omics), enabling more accurate prognostics for MS and potentially
other complex diseases.

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了多智能体环境下的公平性与性能优化问题。

Abstract: We propose a multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MA-MAB) framework aimed at
ensuring fair outcomes across agents while maximizing overall system
performance. A key challenge in this setting is decision-making under limited
information about arm rewards. To address this, we introduce a novel probing
framework that strategically gathers information about selected arms before
allocation. In the offline setting, where reward distributions are known, we
leverage submodular properties to design a greedy probing algorithm with a
provable performance bound. For the more complex online setting, we develop an
algorithm that achieves sublinear regret while maintaining fairness. Extensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our approach
outperforms baseline methods, achieving better fairness and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ICU时间序列数据中状态表示训练不稳定的问题，及其对强化学习策略性能的负面影响。

Method: 采用CDE状态表示，结合早期停止或稳定化方法确保训练稳定性，并通过与临床评分（SOFA、SAPS-II、OASIS）的相关性正则化增强表示。

Result: 稳定训练的CDE表示与临床评分高度相关，支持强化学习策略取得优异性能（WIS回报>0.9），而不稳定训练则导致策略失败（WIS回报~0）。

Conclusion: 训练稳定性对CDE在临床强化学习中的应用至关重要，需结合稳定性和临床相关性以实现有效策略。

Abstract: Effective reinforcement learning (RL) for sepsis treatment depends on
learning stable, clinically meaningful state representations from irregular ICU
time series. While previous works have explored representation learning for
this task, the critical challenge of training instability in sequential
representations and its detrimental impact on policy performance has been
overlooked. This work demonstrates that Controlled Differential Equations (CDE)
state representation can achieve strong RL policies when two key factors are
met: (1) ensuring training stability through early stopping or stabilization
methods, and (2) enforcing acuity-aware representations by correlation
regularization with clinical scores (SOFA, SAPS-II, OASIS). Experiments on the
MIMIC-III sepsis cohort reveal that stable CDE autoencoder produces
representations strongly correlated with acuity scores and enables RL policies
with superior performance (WIS return $> 0.9$). In contrast, unstable CDE
representation leads to degraded representations and policy failure (WIS return
$\sim$ 0). Visualizations of the latent space show that stable CDEs not only
separate survivor and non-survivor trajectories but also reveal clear acuity
score gradients, whereas unstable training fails to capture either pattern.
These findings highlight practical guidelines for using CDEs to encode
irregular medical time series in clinical RL, emphasizing the need for training
stability in sequential representation learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SFT方法对所有令牌一视同仁，忽视了关键任务信息可能仅集中在部分令牌中。

Method: SFT-GO根据令牌重要性分组，结合最差组损失和标准交叉熵损失进行优化。

Result: SFT-GO在多个基准测试中表现优于基线方法，且适用于不同数据集和基础模型。

Conclusion: SFT-GO通过自适应强调关键令牌组，提升了模型学习动态和性能。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has become an essential step in tailoring large
language models (LLMs) to align with human expectations and specific downstream
tasks. However, existing SFT methods typically treat each training instance as
a uniform sequence, giving equal importance to all tokens regardless of their
relevance. This overlooks the fact that only a subset of tokens often contains
critical, task-specific information. To address this limitation, we introduce
Supervised Fine-Tuning with Group Optimization (SFT-GO), a novel approach that
treats groups of tokens differently based on their importance.SFT-GO groups
tokens in each sample based on their importance values and optimizes the LLM
using a weighted combination of the worst-group loss and the standard
cross-entropy loss. This mechanism adaptively emphasizes the most challenging
token groups and guides the model to better handle different group
distributions, thereby improving overall learning dynamics. We provide a
theoretical analysis of SFT-GO's convergence rate, demonstrating its
efficiency. Empirically, we apply SFT-GO with three different token grouping
strategies and show that models trained with SFT-GO consistently outperform
baseline approaches across popular LLM benchmarks. These improvements hold
across various datasets and base models, demonstrating the robustness and the
effectiveness of our method.

Motivation: 研究词汇量对训练动态的影响，弥补μP理论中词汇量固定假设的不足，以优化大型语言模型的预训练效率。

Method: 通过理论分析词汇量对训练动态的作用，提出LV机制，并通过实验验证嵌入学习率的最优缩放规则。

Result: 词汇量增加时，训练动态从μP机制过渡到LV机制，嵌入学习率与隐藏学习率的最优比例应为Θ(√width)，与μP的Θ(width)不同。

Conclusion: 词汇量对训练动态有显著影响，LV机制下的缩放规则更符合实际需求，实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Pretraining large language models is a costly process. To make this process
more efficient, several methods have been proposed to optimize model
architecture/parametrization and hardware use. On the parametrization side,
$\mu P$ (Maximal Update Parametrization) parametrizes model weights and
learning rate (LR) in a way that makes hyperparameters (HPs) transferable with
width (embedding dimension): HPs can be tuned for a small model and used for
larger models without additional tuning. While $\mu$P showed impressive results
in practice, recent empirical studies have reported conflicting observations
when applied to LLMs. One limitation of the theory behind $\mu$P is the fact
that input dimension (vocabulary size in LLMs) is considered fixed when taking
the width to infinity. This is unrealistic since vocabulary size is generally
much larger than width in practice. In this work, we provide a theoretical
analysis of the effect of vocabulary size on training dynamics, and
subsequently show that as vocabulary size increases, the training dynamics
\emph{interpolate between the $\mu$P regime and another regime that we call
Large Vocab (LV) Regime}, where optimal scaling rules are different from those
predicted by $\mu$P. Our analysis reveals that in the LV regime, the optimal
embedding LR to hidden LR ratio should roughly scale as $\Theta(\sqrt{width})$,
surprisingly close to the empirical findings previously reported in the
literature, and different from the $\Theta(width)$ ratio predicted by $\mu$P.
We conduct several experiments to validate our theory, and pretrain a 1B model
from scratch to show the benefit of our suggested scaling rule for the
embedding LR.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is essential for neural architecture search and
hyperparameter optimization, but the conventional approaches impede widespread
use due to prohibitive time and computational costs. Inspired by DeepSeek-V3
multi-token prediction architecture, we propose Sequential Policy Gradient
modeling (SPG), a novel trajectory generation paradigm for lightweight online
hyperparameter optimization. In contrast to conventional policy gradient
methods, SPG extends the base model with temporary modules, enabling it to
generate state-action (padded) trajectories in a single forward pass. Our
experiments demonstrate that models gain performance when retrained with SPG on
their original datasets and also outperform standard transfer fine-tuning. We
evaluate on five datasets spanning computer vision (ImageNet, COCO), natural
language processing (GLUE, SQuAD), and audio (SUPERB) to assess the industrial
applicability of SPG. The proposed method demonstrates consistent improvements
across widely adopted models, achieving performance gains of $+0.2\sim7\%$,
with significantly low computational costs. Fully reproducible code and

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The pursuit of faster optimization algorithms remains an active and important
research direction in deep learning. Recently, the Muon optimizer [JJB+24] has
demonstrated promising empirical performance, but its theoretical foundation
remains less understood. In this paper, we bridge this gap and provide a
theoretical analysis of Muon by placing it within the Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ family
of optimizers [CLLL24]. Specifically, we show that Muon corresponds to
Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ when equipped with the nuclear norm, and we leverage the
theoretical results of Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ to establish that Muon (with
decoupled weight decay) implicitly solves an optimization problem that enforces
a constraint on the spectral norm of weight matrices. This perspective not only
demystifies the implicit regularization effects of Muon but also leads to
natural generalizations through varying the choice of convex map $\mathcal{K}$,
allowing for the exploration of a broader class of implicitly regularized and
constrained optimization algorithms.

Abstract: Modern intelligent transportation systems rely on accurate spatiotemporal
traffic analysis to optimize urban mobility and infrastructure resilience.
However, pervasive missing data caused by sensor failures and heterogeneous
sensing gaps fundamentally hinders reliable traffic modeling. This paper
proposes a Neural Canonical Polyadic Factorization (NCPF) model that synergizes
low-rank tensor algebra with deep representation learning for robust traffic
data imputation. The model innovatively embeds CP decomposition into neural
architecture through learnable embedding projections, where sparse traffic
tensors are encoded into dense latent factors across road segments, time
intervals, and mobility metrics. A hierarchical feature fusion mechanism
employs Hadamard products to explicitly model multilinear interactions, while
stacked multilayer perceptron layers nonlinearly refine these representations
to capture complex spatiotemporal couplings. Extensive evaluations on six urban
traffic datasets demonstrate NCPF's superiority over six state-of-the-art
baselines. By unifying CP decomposition's interpretable factor analysis with
neural network's nonlinear expressive power, NCPF provides a principled yet
flexible approaches for high-dimensional traffic data imputation, offering
critical support for next-generation transportation digital twins and adaptive
traffic control systems.

Abstract: With growing demands for privacy protection, security, and legal compliance
(e.g., GDPR), machine unlearning has emerged as a critical technique for
ensuring the controllability and regulatory alignment of machine learning
models. However, a fundamental challenge in this field lies in effectively
verifying whether unlearning operations have been successfully and thoroughly
executed. Despite a growing body of work on unlearning techniques, verification
methodologies remain comparatively underexplored and often fragmented. Existing
approaches lack a unified taxonomy and a systematic framework for evaluation.
To bridge this gap, this paper presents the first structured survey of machine
unlearning verification methods. We propose a taxonomy that organizes current
techniques into two principal categories -- behavioral verification and
parametric verification -- based on the type of evidence used to assess
unlearning fidelity. We examine representative methods within each category,
analyze their underlying assumptions, strengths, and limitations, and identify
potential vulnerabilities in practical deployment. In closing, we articulate a
set of open problems in current verification research, aiming to provide a
foundation for developing more robust, efficient, and theoretically grounded
unlearning verification mechanisms.

Abstract: Jointly addressing Byzantine attacks and privacy leakage in distributed
machine learning (DML) has become an important issue. A common strategy
involves integrating Byzantine-resilient aggregation rules with differential
privacy mechanisms. However, the incorporation of these techniques often
results in a significant degradation in model accuracy. To address this issue,
we propose a decentralized DML framework, named ImprovDML, that achieves high
model accuracy while simultaneously ensuring privacy preservation and
resilience to Byzantine attacks. The framework leverages a kind of resilient
vector consensus algorithms that can compute a point within the normal
(non-Byzantine) agents' convex hull for resilient aggregation at each
iteration. Then, multivariate Gaussian noises are introduced to the gradients
for privacy preservation. We provide convergence guarantees and derive
asymptotic learning error bounds under non-convex settings, which are tighter
than those reported in existing works. For the privacy analysis, we adopt the
notion of concentrated geo-privacy, which quantifies privacy preservation based
on the Euclidean distance between inputs. We demonstrate that it enables an
improved trade-off between privacy preservation and model accuracy compared to
differential privacy. Finally, numerical simulations validate our theoretical
results.

Conclusion: SKIL通过组合表示提供了一种简洁、原则性的方法，解释了复杂动物行为如何从基本运动原语的动态组合中产生。

Abstract: Animals flexibly recombine a finite set of core motor primitives to meet
diverse task demands, but existing behavior-segmentation methods oversimplify
this process by imposing discrete syllables under restrictive generative
assumptions. To reflect the animal behavior generation procedure, we introduce
skill-based imitation learning (SKIL) for behavior understanding, a
reinforcement learning-based imitation framework that (1) infers interpretable
skill sets, i.e., latent basis functions of behavior, by leveraging
representation learning on transition probabilities, and (2) parameterizes
policies as dynamic mixtures of these skills. We validate our approach on a
simple grid world, a discrete labyrinth, and unconstrained videos of freely
moving animals. Across tasks, it identifies reusable skill components, learns
continuously evolving compositional policies, and generates realistic
trajectories beyond the capabilities of traditional discrete models. By
exploiting generative behavior modeling with compositional representations, our
method offers a concise, principled account of how complex animal behaviors
emerge from dynamic combinations of fundamental motor primitives.

Conclusion: 研究为科学模型提供了新的泛化评估基准，并提出了基于格林函数的可解释性分析框架。

Abstract: While there are many applications of ML to scientific problems that look
promising, visuals can be deceiving. For scientific applications, actual
quantitative accuracy is crucial. This work applies the rigor of numerical
analysis for differential equations to machine learning by specifically
quantifying the accuracy of applying different ML techniques to the elementary
1D Poisson differential equation. Beyond the quantity and discretization of
data, we identify that the function space of the data is critical to the
generalization of the model. We prove generalization bounds and convergence
rates under finite data discretizations and restricted training data subspaces
by analyzing the training dynamics and deriving optimal parameters for both a
white-box differential equation discovery method and a black-box linear model.
The analytically derived generalization bounds are replicated empirically.
Similar lack of generalization is empirically demonstrated for deep linear
models, shallow neural networks, and physics-specific DeepONets and Neural
Operators. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that generalization to
the true physical equation is not guaranteed in each explored case.
Surprisingly, we find that different classes of models can exhibit opposing
generalization behaviors. Based on our theoretical analysis, we also
demonstrate a new mechanistic interpretability lens on scientific models
whereby Green's function representations can be extracted from the weights of
black-box models. Our results inform a new cross-validation technique for
measuring generalization in physical systems. We propose applying it to the
Poisson equation as an evaluation benchmark of future methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全微调的高存储和计算成本，以及现有PEFT方法的延迟、收敛差或固定秩问题。

Method: 结合Kronecker乘积和SVD初始化，动态选择秩，提取权重更新的主成分。

Result: 在LLaMA2-7B上，SoKA仅需0.99M参数，性能优于LoRA/PiSSA，收敛更快且梯度更稳定。

Conclusion: SoKA是一种高效、鲁棒的PEFT方法，适用于大规模模型微调。

Abstract: Large pre-trained Transformer models achieve state-of-the-art results across
diverse language and reasoning tasks, but full fine-tuning incurs substantial
storage, memory, and computational overhead. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) methods mitigate these costs by learning only a small subset of
task-specific parameters, yet existing approaches either introduce
inference-time latency (adapter modules), suffer from suboptimal convergence
(randomly initialized low-rank updates), or rely on fixed rank choices that may
not match task complexity (Kronecker-based decompositions).
  We propose SoKA (SVD on Kronecker Adaptation), a novel PEFT strategy that
combines Kronecker-product tensor factorization with SVD-driven initialization
and spectrum-aware dynamic rank selection. Our Kronecker-Product SVD (KPSVD)
procedure extracts principal components of the full weight update into compact
Kronecker factors, while an adaptive rank selection algorithm uses
energy-threshold and elbow-point criteria to prune negligible components.
  Empirical evaluation on LLaMA2-7B across arithmetic reasoning (GSM8K), formal
mathematics (MATH), and code generation (MBPP) demonstrates that SoKA requires
only 0.99M trainable parameters, 25% fewer than LoRA/PiSSA, while matching or
exceeding baseline performance. Moreover, SoKA exhibits faster convergence and
more stable gradients, highlighting its robustness and efficiency for
large-scale model adaptation.

Abstract: Federated learning allows each client to keep its data locally when training
machine learning models in a distributed setting. Significant recent research
established the requirements that the input must satisfy in order to guarantee
convergence of the training loop. This line of work uses averaging as the
aggregation rule for the training models. In particular, we are interested in
whether federated learning is robust to Byzantine behavior, and observe and
investigate a tradeoff between the average/centroid and the validity conditions
from distributed computing. We show that the various validity conditions alone
do not guarantee a good approximation of the average. Furthermore, we show that
reaching good approximation does not give good results in experimental settings
due to possible Byzantine outliers. Our main contribution is the first lower
bound of $\min\{\frac{n-t}{t},\sqrt{d}\}$ on the centroid approximation under
box validity that is often considered in the literature, where $n$ is the
number of clients, $t$ the upper bound on the number of Byzantine faults, and
$d$ is the dimension of the machine learning model. We complement this lower
bound by an upper bound of $2\min\{n,\sqrt{d}\}$, by providing a new analysis
for the case $n<d$. In addition, we present a new algorithm that achieves a
$\sqrt{2d}$-approximation under convex validity, which also proves that the
existing lower bound in the literature is tight. We show that all presented
bounds can also be achieved in the distributed peer-to-peer setting. We
complement our analytical results with empirical evaluations in federated
stochastic gradient descent and federated averaging settings.

Motivation: 现有数据集推断方法需要与训练数据分布匹配的私有数据集，这在实践中难以获取，限制了DI的适用性。

Result: 实验表明，生成的合成数据作为替代私有数据集，能高置信度检测原始训练数据，同时保持低误报率。

Conclusion: 该方法为数据所有者提供了检测未经授权数据使用的可靠工具，适用于实际版权纠纷。

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be mainly
attributed to their massive training datasets, which are often scraped from the
internet without respecting data owners' intellectual property rights. Dataset
Inference (DI) offers a potential remedy by identifying whether a suspect
dataset was used in training, thereby enabling data owners to verify
unauthorized use. However, existing DI methods require a private set-known to
be absent from training-that closely matches the compromised dataset's
distribution. Such in-distribution, held-out data is rarely available in
practice, severely limiting the applicability of DI. In this work, we address
this challenge by synthetically generating the required held-out set. Our
approach tackles two key obstacles: (1) creating high-quality, diverse
synthetic data that accurately reflects the original distribution, which we
achieve via a data generator trained on a carefully designed suffix-based
completion task, and (2) bridging likelihood gaps between real and synthetic
data, which is realized through post-hoc calibration. Extensive experiments on
diverse text datasets show that using our generated data as a held-out set
enables DI to detect the original training sets with high confidence, while
maintaining a low false positive rate. This result empowers copyright owners to
make legitimate claims on data usage and demonstrates our method's reliability
for real-world litigations. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着电动汽车普及，需要一种能够兼顾城市、郊区和农村需求的基础设施规划工具。

Method: 方法包括数据栅格化、图神经网络中心性模型、Voronoi分割、队列模型和贪心算法。

Result: 在乔治亚州应用中，覆盖范围提升12%，低收入居民充电距离减半，且满足电力限制。

Conclusion: DOVA-PATBM展示了多分辨率方法在学术优化与可部署政策之间的桥梁作用。

Abstract: The accelerating uptake of battery-electric vehicles demands infrastructure
planning tools that are both data-rich and geographically scalable. Whereas
most prior studies optimise charging locations for single cities, state-wide
and national networks must reconcile the conflicting requirements of dense
metropolitan cores, car-dependent exurbs, and power-constrained rural
corridors.
  We present DOVA-PATBM (Deployment Optimisation with Voronoi-oriented,
Adaptive, POI-Aware Temporal Behaviour Model), a geo-computational framework
that unifies these contexts in a single pipeline. The method rasterises
heterogeneous data (roads, population, night lights, POIs, and feeder lines)
onto a hierarchical H3 grid, infers intersection importance with a
zone-normalised graph neural network centrality model, and overlays a Voronoi
tessellation that guarantees at least one five-port DC fast charger within
every 30 km radius. Hourly arrival profiles, learned from loop-detector and
floating-car traces, feed a finite M/M/c queue to size ports under
feeder-capacity and outage-risk constraints. A greedy maximal-coverage
heuristic with income-weighted penalties then selects the minimum number of
sites that satisfy coverage and equity targets.
  Applied to the State of Georgia, USA, DOVA-PATBM (i) increases 30 km tile
coverage by 12 percentage points, (ii) halves the mean distance that low-income
residents travel to the nearest charger, and (iii) meets sub-transmission
headroom everywhere -- all while remaining computationally tractable for
national-scale roll-outs. These results demonstrate that a tightly integrated,
GNN-driven, multi-resolution approach can bridge the gap between academic
optimisation and deployable infrastructure policy.

Result: 在合成和真实数据上的实验验证了模型在信用风险评估和贷款规模确定方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究是生成式AI在CBEC SCF风险管理中的开创性应用，为提升信用实践和改善中小企业融资渠道奠定了基础。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of cross-border e-commerce (CBEC) has created significant
opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), yet financing
remains a critical challenge due to SMEs' limited credit histories. Third-party
logistics (3PL)-led supply chain finance (SCF) has emerged as a promising
solution, leveraging in-transit inventory as collateral. We propose an advanced
credit risk management framework tailored for 3PL-led SCF, addressing the dual
challenges of credit risk assessment and loan size determination. Specifically,
we leverage conditional generative modeling of sales distributions through
Quantile-Regression-based Generative Metamodeling (QRGMM) as the foundation for
risk estimation. We propose a unified framework that enables flexible
estimation of multiple risk measures while introducing a functional risk
measure formulation that systematically captures the relationship between these
risk measures and varying loan levels, supported by theoretical guarantees. To
capture complex covariate interactions in e-commerce sales data, we integrate
QRGMM with Deep Factorization Machines (DeepFM). Extensive experiments on
synthetic and real-world data validate the efficacy of our model for credit
risk assessment and loan size determination. This study represents a pioneering
application of generative AI in CBEC SCF risk management, offering a solid
foundation for enhanced credit practices and improved SME access to capital.

Conclusion: SecFwT为隐私保护LLM微调提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed numerous fields, yet their
adaptation to specialized tasks in privacy-sensitive domains, such as
healthcare and finance, is constrained by the scarcity of accessible training
data due to stringent privacy requirements. Secure multi-party computation
(MPC)-based privacy-preserving machine learning offers a powerful approach to
protect both model parameters and user data, but its application to LLMs has
been largely limited to inference, as fine-tuning introduces significant
computational challenges, particularly in privacy-preserving backward
propagation and optimizer operations. This paper identifies two primary
obstacles to MPC-based privacy-preserving fine-tuning of LLMs: (1) the
substantial computational overhead of backward and optimizer processes, and (2)
the inefficiency of softmax-based attention mechanisms in MPC settings. To
address these challenges, we propose SecFwT, the first MPC-based framework
designed for efficient, privacy-preserving LLM fine-tuning. SecFwT introduces a
forward-only tuning paradigm to eliminate backward and optimizer computations
and employs MPC-friendly Random Feature Attention to approximate softmax
attention, significantly reducing costly non-linear operations and
computational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that SecFwT delivers
substantial improvements in efficiency and privacy preservation, enabling
scalable and secure fine-tuning of LLMs for privacy-critical applications.

Abstract: Simultaneously optimizing molecules against multiple therapeutic targets
remains a profound challenge in drug discovery, particularly due to sparse
rewards and conflicting design constraints. We propose a structured active
learning (AL) paradigm integrating a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) variational
autoencoder (VAE) into iterative loops designed to balance chemical diversity,
molecular quality, and multi-target affinity. Our method alternates between
expanding chemically feasible regions of latent space and progressively
constraining molecules based on increasingly stringent multi-target docking
thresholds. In a proof-of-concept study targeting three related coronavirus
main proteases (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV), our approach efficiently
generated a structurally diverse set of pan-inhibitor candidates. We
demonstrate that careful timing and strategic placement of chemical filters
within this active learning pipeline markedly enhance exploration of beneficial
chemical space, transforming the sparse-reward, multi-objective drug design
problem into an accessible computational task. Our framework thus provides a
generalizable roadmap for efficiently navigating complex polypharmacological
landscapes.

Result: 单层模型无法利用未标记数据，而多层或循环模型能通过隐式构造多项式有效利用未标记数据。

Conclusion: 通过循环现成的表格基础模型，可以显著提升半监督学习性能。

Abstract: Recent research shows that in-context learning (ICL) can be effective even
when demonstrations have missing or incorrect labels. To shed light on this
capability, we examine a canonical setting where the demonstrations are drawn
according to a binary Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and a certain fraction of
the demonstrations have missing labels. We provide a comprehensive theoretical
study to show that: (1) The loss landscape of one-layer linear attention models
recover the optimal fully-supervised estimator but completely fail to exploit
unlabeled data; (2) In contrast, multilayer or looped transformers can
effectively leverage unlabeled data by implicitly constructing estimators of
the form $\sum_{i\ge 0} a_i (X^\top X)^iX^\top y$ with $X$ and $y$ denoting
features and partially-observed labels (with missing entries set to zero). We
characterize the class of polynomials that can be expressed as a function of
depth and draw connections to Expectation Maximization, an iterative
pseudo-labeling algorithm commonly used in semi-supervised learning.
Importantly, the leading polynomial power is exponential in depth, so mild
amount of depth/looping suffices. As an application of theory, we propose
looping off-the-shelf tabular foundation models to enhance their
semi-supervision capabilities. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets
show that our method significantly improves the semisupervised tabular learning
performance over the standard single pass inference.

Abstract: Clinical laboratory results are ubiquitous in any diagnosis making.
Predicting abnormal values of not prescribed tests based on the results of
performed tests looks intriguing, as it would be possible to make early
diagnosis available to everyone. The special place is taken by the Common Blood
Count (CBC) test, as it is the most widely used clinical procedure. Combining
routine biochemical panels with CBC presents a set of test-value pairs that
varies from patient to patient, or, in common settings, a table with missing
values. Here we formulate a tabular modeling problem as a set translation
problem where the source set comprises pairs of GPT-like label column embedding
and its corresponding value while the target set consists of the same type
embeddings only. The proposed approach can effectively deal with missing values
without implicitly estimating them and bridges the world of LLM with the
tabular domain. Applying this method to clinical laboratory data, we achieve an
improvement up to 8% AUC for joint predictions of high uric acid, glucose,
cholesterol, and low ferritin levels.

Abstract: Neural network potentials (NNPs) offer a powerful alternative to traditional
force fields for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Accurate and stable MD
simulations, crucial for evaluating material properties, require training data
encompassing both low-energy stable structures and high-energy structures.
Conventional knowledge distillation (KD) methods fine-tune a pre-trained NNP as
a teacher model to generate training data for a student model. However, in
material-specific models, this fine-tuning process increases energy barriers,
making it difficult to create training data containing high-energy structures.
To address this, we propose a novel KD framework that leverages a
non-fine-tuned, off-the-shelf pre-trained NNP as a teacher. Its gentler energy
landscape facilitates the exploration of a wider range of structures, including
the high-energy structures crucial for stable MD simulations. Our framework
employs a two-stage training process: first, the student NNP is trained with a
dataset generated by the off-the-shelf teacher; then, it is fine-tuned with a
smaller, high-accuracy density functional theory (DFT) dataset. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our framework by applying it to both organic (polyethylene
glycol) and inorganic (L$_{10}$GeP$_{2}$S$_{12}$) materials, achieving
comparable or superior accuracy in reproducing physical properties compared to
existing methods. Importantly, our method reduces the number of expensive DFT
calculations by 10x compared to existing NNP generation methods, without
sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Recent developments in application of deep learning models to acoustic Full
Waveform Inversion (FWI) are marked by the use of diffusion models as prior
distributions for Bayesian-like inference procedures. The advantage of these
methods is the ability to generate high-resolution samples, which are otherwise
unattainable with classical inversion methods or other deep learning-based
solutions. However, the iterative and stochastic nature of sampling from
diffusion models along with heuristic nature of output control remain limiting
factors for their applicability. For instance, an optimal way to include the
approximate velocity model into diffusion-based inversion scheme remains
unclear, even though it is considered an essential part of FWI pipeline. We
address the issue by employing a Schr\"odinger Bridge that interpolates between
the distributions of ground truth and smoothed velocity models. To facilitate
the learning of nonlinear drifts that transfer samples between distributions we
extend the concept of Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge
($\text{I}^2\text{SB}$) to conditional sampling, resulting in a conditional
Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge (c$\text{I}^2\text{SB}$) framework. To
validate our method, we assess its effectiveness in reconstructing the
reference velocity model from its smoothed approximation, coupled with the
observed seismic signal of fixed shape. Our experiments demonstrate that the
proposed solution outperforms our reimplementation of conditional diffusion
model suggested in earlier works, while requiring only a few neural function
evaluations (NFEs) to achieve sample fidelity superior to that attained with
supervised learning-based approach. The supplementary code implementing the
algorithms described in this paper can be found in the repository

<details>

Motivation: 现有黑盒设置下的单次运行审计方法在实证下界与理论上界之间存在较大差距，因此需要改进。

Method: 利用分位数回归进行成员推理攻击（MIA），以提升审计效果。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，提出的方法能够获得更紧密的隐私保证下界，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: 通过结合更强的MIA方法，可以在黑盒设置下有效改进单次运行审计的性能。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) auditing aims to provide empirical lower bounds on
the privacy guarantees of DP mechanisms like DP-SGD. While some existing
techniques require many training runs that are prohibitively costly, recent
work introduces one-run auditing approaches that effectively audit DP-SGD in
white-box settings while still being computationally efficient. However, in the
more practical black-box setting where gradients cannot be manipulated during
training and only the last model iterate is observed, prior work shows that
there is still a large gap between the empirical lower bounds and theoretical
upper bounds. Consequently, in this work, we study how incorporating approaches
for stronger membership inference attacks (MIA) can improve one-run auditing in
the black-box setting. Evaluating on image classification models trained on
CIFAR-10 with DP-SGD, we demonstrate that our proposed approach, which utilizes
quantile regression for MIA, achieves tighter bounds while crucially
maintaining the computational efficiency of one-run methods.

Conclusion: DiTMC展示了架构选择和对称性先验对样本质量和效率的影响，为大规模分子结构生成建模提供了方向。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated strong performance in
generative modeling, particularly in image synthesis, making them a compelling
choice for molecular conformer generation. However, applying DiTs to molecules
introduces novel challenges, such as integrating discrete molecular graph
information with continuous 3D geometry, handling Euclidean symmetries, and
designing conditioning mechanisms that generalize across molecules of varying
sizes and structures. We propose DiTMC, a framework that adapts DiTs to address
these challenges through a modular architecture that separates the processing
of 3D coordinates from conditioning on atomic connectivity. To this end, we
introduce two complementary graph-based conditioning strategies that integrate
seamlessly with the DiT architecture. These are combined with different
attention mechanisms, including both standard non-equivariant and
SO(3)-equivariant formulations, enabling flexible control over the trade-off
between between accuracy and computational efficiency. Experiments on standard
conformer generation benchmarks (GEOM-QM9, -DRUGS, -XL) demonstrate that DiTMC
achieves state-of-the-art precision and physical validity. Our results
highlight how architectural choices and symmetry priors affect sample quality
and efficiency, suggesting promising directions for large-scale generative
modeling of molecular structures. Code available at

Conclusion: 该方法在scRNA-seq数据上验证了其有效性和可解释性，为多疾病分析提供了新工具。

Abstract: Optimal transport provides a robust framework for comparing probability
distributions. Its effectiveness is significantly influenced by the choice of
the underlying ground metric. Traditionally, the ground metric has either been
(i) predefined, e.g., as the Euclidean distance, or (ii) learned in a
supervised way, by utilizing labeled data to learn a suitable ground metric for
enhanced task-specific performance. Yet, predefined metrics typically cannot
account for the inherent structure and varying importance of different features
in the data, and existing supervised approaches to ground metric learning often
do not generalize across multiple classes or are restricted to distributions
with shared supports. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach
for learning metrics for arbitrary distributions over a shared metric space.
Our method provides a distance between individual points like a global metric,
but requires only class labels on a distribution-level for training. The
learned global ground metric enables more accurate optimal transport distances,
leading to improved performance in embedding, clustering and classification
tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of our approach
using patient-level scRNA-seq data spanning multiple diseases.

Abstract: Exploration is critical for solving real-world decision-making problems such
as scientific discovery, where the objective is to generate truly novel designs
rather than mimic existing data distributions. In this work, we address the
challenge of leveraging the representational power of generative models for
exploration without relying on explicit uncertainty quantification. We
introduce a novel framework that casts exploration as entropy maximization over
the approximate data manifold implicitly defined by a pre-trained diffusion
model. Then, we present a novel principle for exploration based on density
estimation, a problem well-known to be challenging in practice. To overcome
this issue and render this method truly scalable, we leverage a fundamental
connection between the entropy of the density induced by a diffusion model and
its score function. Building on this, we develop an algorithm based on mirror
descent that solves the exploration problem as sequential fine-tuning of a
pre-trained diffusion model. We prove its convergence to the optimal
exploratory diffusion model under realistic assumptions by leveraging recent
understanding of mirror flows. Finally, we empirically evaluate our approach on
both synthetic and high-dimensional text-to-image diffusion, demonstrating
promising results.

Abstract: The Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model is a widely used model for
the spread of information and infectious diseases, particularly non-immunizing
ones, on a graph. Given a highly contagious disease, a natural question is how
to best vaccinate individuals to minimize the disease's extinction time. While
previous works showed that the problem of optimal vaccination is closely linked
to the NP-hard Spectral Radius Minimization (SRM) problem, they assumed that
the graph is known, which is often not the case in practice. In this work, we
consider the problem of minimizing the extinction time of an outbreak modeled
by an SIS model where the graph on which the disease spreads is unknown and
only the infection states of the vertices are observed. To this end, we split
the problem into two: learning the graph and determining effective vaccination
strategies. We propose a novel inclusion-exclusion-based learning algorithm
and, unlike previous approaches, establish its sample complexity for graph
recovery. We then detail an optimal algorithm for the SRM problem and prove
that its running time is polynomial in the number of vertices for graphs with
bounded treewidth. This is complemented by an efficient and effective
polynomial-time greedy heuristic for any graph. Finally, we present experiments
on synthetic and real-world data that numerically validate our learning and
vaccination algorithms.

Abstract: Modern AI systems frequently rely on opaque black-box models, most notably
Deep Neural Networks, whose performance stems from complex architectures with
millions of learned parameters. While powerful, their complexity poses a major
challenge to trustworthiness, particularly due to a lack of transparency.
Explainable AI (XAI) addresses this issue by providing human-understandable
explanations of model behavior. However, to ensure their usefulness and
trustworthiness, such explanations must be rigorously evaluated. Despite the
growing number of XAI methods, the field lacks standardized evaluation
protocols and consensus on appropriate metrics. To address this gap, we conduct
a systematic literature review following the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and introduce a
unified framework for the eValuation of XAI (VXAI). We identify 362 relevant
publications and aggregate their contributions into 41 functionally similar
metric groups. In addition, we propose a three-dimensional categorization
scheme spanning explanation type, evaluation contextuality, and explanation
quality desiderata. Our framework provides the most comprehensive and
structured overview of VXAI to date. It supports systematic metric selection,
promotes comparability across methods, and offers a flexible foundation for
future extensions.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), agents continually interact with the
environment and use the feedback to refine their behavior. To guide policy
optimization, reward models are introduced as proxies of the desired
objectives, such that when the agent maximizes the accumulated reward, it also
fulfills the task designer's intentions. Recently, significant attention from
both academic and industrial researchers has focused on developing reward
models that not only align closely with the true objectives but also facilitate
policy optimization. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of
reward modeling techniques within the deep RL literature. We begin by outlining
the background and preliminaries in reward modeling. Next, we present an
overview of recent reward modeling approaches, categorizing them based on the
source, the mechanism, and the learning paradigm. Building on this
understanding, we discuss various applications of these reward modeling
techniques and review methods for evaluating reward models. Finally, we
conclude by highlighting promising research directions in reward modeling.
Altogether, this survey includes both established and emerging methods, filling
the vacancy of a systematic review of reward models in current literature.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that, under certain assumptions, zero-shot
reinforcement learning (RL) methods can generalise to any unseen task in an
environment after reward-free pre-training. Access to Markov states is one such
assumption, yet, in many real-world applications, the Markov state is only
partially observable. Here, we explore how the performance of standard
zero-shot RL methods degrades when subjected to partially observability, and
show that, as in single-task RL, memory-based architectures are an effective
remedy. We evaluate our memory-based zero-shot RL methods in domains where the
states, rewards and a change in dynamics are partially observed, and show
improved performance over memory-free baselines. Our code is open-sourced via:

Result: 在八个真实数据集上，RHO能有效学习多样同质性，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RHO通过自适应学习同质性模式，解决了现有方法的局限性，提升了异常检测性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised graph anomaly detection (GAD) utilizes a small set of labeled
normal nodes to identify abnormal nodes from a large set of unlabeled nodes in
a graph. Current methods in this line posit that 1) normal nodes share a
similar level of homophily and 2) the labeled normal nodes can well represent
the homophily patterns in the normal class. However, this assumption often does
not hold well since normal nodes in a graph can exhibit diverse homophily in
real-world GAD datasets. In this paper, we propose RHO, namely Robust Homophily
Learning, to adaptively learn such homophily patterns. RHO consists of two
novel modules, adaptive frequency response filters (AdaFreq) and graph
normality alignment (GNA). AdaFreq learns a set of adaptive spectral filters
that capture different frequency components of the labeled normal nodes with
varying homophily in the channel-wise and cross-channel views of node
attributes. GNA is introduced to enforce consistency between the channel-wise
and cross-channel homophily representations to robustify the normality learned
by the filters in the two views. Experiments on eight real-world GAD datasets
show that RHO can effectively learn varying, often under-represented, homophily
in the small normal node set and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art
competing methods. Code is available at https://github.com/mala-lab/RHO.

Method: 通过简化扭曲路径，提出了一种新技术，用于突出、量化和可视化关键变换。

Result: 该方法能够更清晰地展示子序列之间的匹配关系，从而提升时间序列比较的可解释性。

Conclusion: 该技术填补了弹性距离测量中定性比较的空白，为时间序列分析提供了更直观的工具。

Abstract: Comparing time series is essential in various tasks such as clustering and
classification. While elastic distance measures that allow warping provide a
robust quantitative comparison, a qualitative comparison on top of them is
missing. Traditional visualizations focus on point-to-point alignment and do
not convey the broader structural relationships at the level of subsequences.
This limitation makes it difficult to understand how and where one time series
shifts, speeds up or slows down with respect to another. To address this, we
propose a novel technique that simplifies the warping path to highlight,
quantify and visualize key transformations (shift, compression, difference in
amplitude). By offering a clearer representation of how subsequences match
between time series, our method enhances interpretability in time series
comparison.

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques map high-dimensional data into
lower-dimensional spaces. Yet, current DR techniques are not designed to
explore semantic structure that is not directly available in the form of
variables or class labels. We introduce a novel user-guided projection
framework for image and text data that enables customizable, interpretable,
data visualizations via zero-shot classification with Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). We enable users to steer projections dynamically via
natural-language guiding prompts, to specify high-level semantic relationships
of interest to the users which are not explicitly present in the data
dimensions. We evaluate our method across several datasets and show that it not
only enhances cluster separation, but also transforms DR into an interactive,
user-driven process. Our approach bridges the gap between fully automated DR
techniques and human-centered data exploration, offering a flexible and
adaptive way to tailor projections to specific analytical needs.

Conclusion: LIT-LVM不仅提升预测精度，还提供了特征的低维可视化表示，有助于分析特征关系。

Abstract: Some of the simplest, yet most frequently used predictors in statistics and
machine learning use weighted linear combinations of features. Such linear
predictors can model non-linear relationships between features by adding
interaction terms corresponding to the products of all pairs of features. We
consider the problem of accurately estimating coefficients for interaction
terms in linear predictors. We hypothesize that the coefficients for different
interaction terms have an approximate low-dimensional structure and represent
each feature by a latent vector in a low-dimensional space. This
low-dimensional representation can be viewed as a structured regularization
approach that further mitigates overfitting in high-dimensional settings beyond
standard regularizers such as the lasso and elastic net. We demonstrate that
our approach, called LIT-LVM, achieves superior prediction accuracy compared to
elastic net and factorization machines on a wide variety of simulated and real
data, particularly when the number of interaction terms is high compared to the
number of samples. LIT-LVM also provides low-dimensional latent representations
for features that are useful for visualizing and analyzing their relationships.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Post-hoc attribution methods aim to explain deep learning predictions by
highlighting influential input pixels. However, these explanations are highly
non-robust: small, imperceptible input perturbations can drastically alter the
attribution map while maintaining the same prediction. This vulnerability
undermines their trustworthiness and calls for rigorous robustness guarantees
of pixel-level attribution scores. We introduce the first certification
framework that guarantees pixel-level robustness for any black-box attribution
method using randomized smoothing. By sparsifying and smoothing attribution
maps, we reformulate the task as a segmentation problem and certify each
pixel's importance against $\ell_2$-bounded perturbations. We further propose
three evaluation metrics to assess certified robustness, localization, and
faithfulness. An extensive evaluation of 12 attribution methods across 5
ImageNet models shows that our certified attributions are robust,
interpretable, and faithful, enabling reliable use in downstream tasks. Our
code is at https://github.com/AlaaAnani/certified-attributions.

Conclusion: 论文为时空图神经网络的设计提供了理论指导和实践验证，揭示了其独特的时空信息传播特性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across various
domains. However, recent theoretical advances have identified fundamental
limitations in their information propagation capabilities, such as
over-squashing, where distant nodes fail to effectively exchange information.
While extensively studied in static contexts, this issue remains unexplored in
Spatiotemporal GNNs (STGNNs), which process sequences associated with graph
nodes. Nonetheless, the temporal dimension amplifies this challenge by
increasing the information that must be propagated. In this work, we formalize
the spatiotemporal over-squashing problem and demonstrate its distinct
characteristics compared to the static case. Our analysis reveals that
counterintuitively, convolutional STGNNs favor information propagation from
points temporally distant rather than close in time. Moreover, we prove that
architectures that follow either time-and-space or time-then-space processing
paradigms are equally affected by this phenomenon, providing theoretical
justification for computationally efficient implementations. We validate our
findings on synthetic and real-world datasets, providing deeper insights into
their operational dynamics and principled guidance for more effective designs.

Conclusion: RePCS为RAG系统提供了一种高效的黑盒保障，特别适用于安全关键应用。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a common strategy for
updating large language model (LLM) responses with current, external
information. However, models may still rely on memorized training data, bypass
the retrieved evidence, and produce contaminated outputs. We introduce
Retrieval-Path Contamination Scoring (RePCS), a diagnostic method that detects
such behavior without requiring model access or retraining. RePCS compares two
inference paths: (i) a parametric path using only the query, and (ii) a
retrieval-augmented path using both the query and retrieved context by
computing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between their output
distributions. A low divergence suggests that the retrieved context had minimal
impact, indicating potential memorization. This procedure is model-agnostic,
requires no gradient or internal state access, and adds only a single
additional forward pass. We further derive PAC-style guarantees that link the
KL threshold to user-defined false positive and false negative rates. On the
Prompt-WNQA benchmark, RePCS achieves a ROC-AUC of 0.918. This result
outperforms the strongest prior method by 6.5 percentage points while keeping
latency overhead below 4.7% on an NVIDIA T4 GPU. RePCS offers a lightweight,
black-box safeguard to verify whether a RAG system meaningfully leverages
retrieval, making it especially valuable in safety-critical applications.

TL;DR: 本文通过简化分析，复现了Zou等人关于SGD在线性回归中的偏差和方差界限，避免了复杂的PSD矩阵操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在使SGD在线性回归中的分析更易理解，并为后续研究（如小批量处理和学习率调度）提供基础。

Method: 使用简单的线性代数工具，简化了SGD在过参数化线性模型中的理论分析。

Result: 成功复现了Zou等人的偏差和方差界限，且无需处理PSD矩阵。

Conclusion: 该简化分析使SGD的理论更易理解，有望推动实际模型训练的改进。

Abstract: Theoretically understanding stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in
overparameterized models has led to the development of several optimization
algorithms that are widely used in practice today. Recent work
by~\citet{zou2021benign} provides sharp rates for SGD optimization in linear
regression using constant learning rate, both with and without tail iterate
averaging, based on a bias-variance decomposition of the risk. In our work, we
provide a simplified analysis recovering the same bias and variance bounds
provided in~\citep{zou2021benign} based on simple linear algebra tools,
bypassing the requirement to manipulate operators on positive semi-definite
(PSD) matrices. We believe our work makes the analysis of SGD on linear
regression very accessible and will be helpful in further analyzing
mini-batching and learning rate scheduling, leading to improvements in the
training of realistic models.

TL;DR: PRISM框架通过识别和评分多义性特征，解决了现有方法在神经网络特征描述中的局限性，提升了描述的准确性和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征描述方法假设神经元是单义的（monosemantic），但实际中神经元常是多义的（polysemantic），限制了描述的全面性和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出PRISM框架，为多义性和单义性特征提供更细致的描述方法。

Result: PRISM在语言模型中表现优于现有方法，提升了描述质量和多义性捕捉能力。

Conclusion: PRISM通过更复杂的特征描述方法，显著改进了神经网络的可解释性。

Abstract: Automated interpretability research aims to identify concepts encoded in
neural network features to enhance human understanding of model behavior.
Current feature description methods face two critical challenges: limited
robustness and the flawed assumption that each neuron encodes only a single
concept (monosemanticity), despite growing evidence that neurons are often
polysemantic. This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature
descriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors
encoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe
Identification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework that captures the
inherent complexity of neural network features. Unlike prior approaches that
assign a single description per feature, PRISM provides more nuanced
descriptions for both polysemantic and monosemantic features. We apply PRISM to
language models and, through extensive benchmarking against existing methods,
demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and faithful feature
descriptions, improving both overall description quality (via a description
score) and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is
present (via a polysemanticity score).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统输入输出观察不足以在极限下学习一般递归函数，因此需要引入更现实的约束条件，如计算复杂性限制或近似时间限制观察。

Method: 扩展Gold的归纳推理框架，引入时间限制观察和策略轨迹观察，并构建围绕计算代理观察的正式框架。

Result: 通过补充时间限制观察或计算复杂性约束，克服了学习一般递归函数的障碍。策略轨迹观察将问题简化为从输入输出学习有理函数。

Conclusion: 计算或多项式质量特征集对于线性时间可计算函数不存在，即使使用策略轨迹观察。

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of learning computable functions in the limit
by extending Gold's inductive inference framework to incorporate
\textit{computational observations} and \textit{restricted input sources}.
Complimentary to the traditional Input-Output Observations, we introduce
Time-Bound Observations, and Policy-Trajectory Observations to study the
learnability of general recursive functions under more realistic constraints.
While input-output observations do not suffice for learning the class of
general recursive functions in the limit, we overcome this learning barrier by
imposing computational complexity constraints or supplementing with approximate
time-bound observations. Further, we build a formal framework around
observations of \textit{computational agents} and show that learning computable
functions from policy trajectories reduces to learning rational functions from
input and output, thereby revealing interesting connections to finite-state
transducer inference. On the negative side, we show that computable or
polynomial-mass characteristic sets cannot exist for the class of linear-time
computable functions even for policy-trajectory observations.

Conclusion: 研究为深度强化学习的扩展提供了有效解决方案，并通过多种环境和智能体验证。

Abstract: Scaling deep reinforcement learning networks is challenging and often results
in degraded performance, yet the root causes of this failure mode remain poorly
understood. Several recent works have proposed mechanisms to address this, but
they are often complex and fail to highlight the causes underlying this
difficulty. In this work, we conduct a series of empirical analyses which
suggest that the combination of non-stationarity with gradient pathologies, due
to suboptimal architectural choices, underlie the challenges of scale. We
propose a series of direct interventions that stabilize gradient flow, enabling
robust performance across a range of network depths and widths. Our
interventions are simple to implement and compatible with well-established
algorithms, and result in an effective mechanism that enables strong
performance even at large scales. We validate our findings on a variety of
agents and suites of environments.

Conclusion: DAILOC通过联合处理时间和设备引起的域偏移，显著提升了室内定位的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Wi-Fi fingerprinting-based indoor localization faces significant challenges
in real-world deployments due to domain shifts arising from device
heterogeneity and temporal variations within indoor environments. Existing
approaches often address these issues independently, resulting in poor
generalization and susceptibility to catastrophic forgetting over time. In this
work, we propose DAILOC, a novel domain-incremental learning framework that
jointly addresses both temporal and device-induced domain shifts. DAILOC
introduces a novel disentanglement strategy that separates domain shifts from
location-relevant features using a multi-level variational autoencoder.
Additionally, we introduce a novel memory-guided class latent alignment
mechanism to address the effects of catastrophic forgetting over time.
Experiments across multiple smartphones, buildings, and time instances
demonstrate that DAILOC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving up to 2.74x lower average error and 4.6x lower worst-case error.

Motivation: 现有深度学习室内定位模型缺乏可解释性，难以应对环境动态变化，影响长期可靠性。

Method: 提出LogNet框架，通过逻辑门设计实现透明推理，识别关键接入点并分析环境噪声对定位决策的影响。

Result: LogNet在多个真实场景中显著降低定位误差（1.1x-2.8x）、减小模型大小（3.4x-43.3x）和延迟（1.5x-3.6x）。

Conclusion: LogNet不仅提升了深度学习模型的可解释性，还优化了性能，适用于长期稳定的室内定位部署。

Abstract: Indoor localization using deep learning (DL) has demonstrated strong accuracy
in mapping Wi-Fi RSS fingerprints to physical locations; however, most existing
DL frameworks function as black-box models, offering limited insight into how
predictions are made or how models respond to real-world noise over time. This
lack of interpretability hampers our ability to understand the impact of
temporal variations - caused by environmental dynamics - and to adapt models
for long-term reliability. To address this, we introduce LogNet, a novel logic
gate-based framework designed to interpret and enhance DL-based indoor
localization. LogNet enables transparent reasoning by identifying which access
points (APs) are most influential for each reference point (RP) and reveals how
environmental noise disrupts DL-driven localization decisions. This
interpretability allows us to trace and diagnose model failures and adapt DL
systems for more stable long-term deployments. Evaluations across multiple
real-world building floorplans and over two years of temporal variation show
that LogNet not only interprets the internal behavior of DL models but also
improves performance-achieving up to 1.1x to 2.8x lower localization error,
3.4x to 43.3x smaller model size, and 1.5x to 3.6x lower latency compared to
prior DL-based models.

TL;DR: DP-GRAPE是一种新型差分隐私训练方法，通过梯度随机投影显著减少内存使用，同时保持与现有方法相当的效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决DP-Adam等标准差分隐私方法因逐样本梯度裁剪导致的高内存开销问题，提升可扩展性。

Method: 引入梯度随机投影（DP-GRAPE），包括梯度投影后私有化、使用高斯随机矩阵替代SVD子空间，以及在反向传播中应用投影。

Result: 实验显示DP-GRAPE可减少63%以上的内存使用（如ViT预训练）和70%以上（如RoBERTa-Large微调），且性能不降。

Conclusion: DP-GRAPE在保持隐私-效用平衡的同时，显著降低了内存需求，适用于大规模模型训练。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) protects sensitive data during neural network
training, but standard methods like DP-Adam suffer from high memory overhead
due to per-sample gradient clipping, limiting scalability. We introduce
DP-GRAPE (Gradient RAndom ProjEction), a DP training method that significantly
reduces memory usage while maintaining utility on par with first-order DP
approaches. Rather than directly applying DP to GaLore, DP-GRAPE introduces
three key modifications: (1) gradients are privatized after projection, (2)
random Gaussian matrices replace SVD-based subspaces, and (3) projection is
applied during backpropagation. These contributions eliminate the need for
costly SVD computations, enable substantial memory savings, and lead to
improved utility. Despite operating in lower-dimensional subspaces, our
theoretical analysis shows that DP-GRAPE achieves a privacy-utility trade-off
comparable to DP-SGD. Our extensive empirical experiments show that DP-GRAPE
can reduce the memory footprint of DP training without sacrificing accuracy or
training time. In particular, DP-GRAPE reduces memory usage by over 63% when
pre-training Vision Transformers and over 70% when fine-tuning RoBERTa-Large as
compared to DP-Adam, while achieving similar performance. We further
demonstrate that DP-GRAPE scales to fine-tuning large models such as OPT with
up to 6.7 billion parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的广泛应用引发了安全问题，即使对齐后的模型也可能因微调而削弱安全保护。

Method: 基于安全关键低秩子空间的敏感性，提出LoX方法，外推对齐LLM的安全子空间。

Result: LoX显著降低了攻击成功率（11%至54%），同时保持模型对新任务的适应性。

Conclusion: LoX通过将参数移动到更平坦区域，减少对扰动的敏感性，提升了安全鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable in real-world
applications. However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety
concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite
substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models
can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning -
even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we
empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of
safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building
on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank
Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety
subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness
of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both
benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's
adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute
reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning
attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the
success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter
zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations. The code is available at
github.com/VITA-Group/LoX.

Result: 实验结果表明，GFLC在性能和公平性指标之间取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: GFLC是一种有效的方法，能够在校正标签噪声的同时保持数据集的公平性。

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning (ML) has a critical importance for building
trustworthy machine learning system as artificial intelligence (AI) systems
increasingly impact various aspects of society, including healthcare decisions
and legal judgments. Moreover, numerous studies demonstrate evidence of unfair
outcomes in ML and the need for more robust fairness-aware methods. However,
the data we use to train and develop debiasing techniques often contains biased
and noisy labels. As a result, the label bias in the training data affects
model performance and misrepresents the fairness of classifiers during testing.
To tackle this problem, our paper presents Graph-based Fairness-aware Label
Correction (GFLC), an efficient method for correcting label noise while
preserving demographic parity in datasets. In particular, our approach combines
three key components: prediction confidence measure, graph-based regularization
through Ricci-flow-optimized graph Laplacians, and explicit demographic parity
incentives. Our experimental findings show the effectiveness of our proposed
approach and show significant improvements in the trade-off between performance
and fairness metrics compared to the baseline.

Abstract: $\textbf{Objective:}$ Brain-predicted age difference (BrainAGE) is a
neuroimaging biomarker reflecting brain health. However, training robust
BrainAGE models requires large datasets, often restricted by privacy concerns.
This study evaluates the performance of federated learning (FL) for BrainAGE
estimation in ischemic stroke patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy,
and investigates its association with clinical phenotypes and functional
outcomes.
  $\textbf{Methods:}$ We used FLAIR brain images from 1674 stroke patients
across 16 hospital centers. We implemented standard machine learning and deep
learning models for BrainAGE estimates under three data management strategies:
centralized learning (pooled data), FL (local training at each site), and
single-site learning. We reported prediction errors and examined associations
between BrainAGE and vascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, smoking), as well as functional outcomes at three months
post-stroke. Logistic regression evaluated BrainAGE's predictive value for
these outcomes, adjusting for age, sex, vascular risk factors, stroke severity,
time between MRI and arterial puncture, prior intravenous thrombolysis, and
recanalisation outcome.
  $\textbf{Results:}$ While centralized learning yielded the most accurate
predictions, FL consistently outperformed single-site models. BrainAGE was
significantly higher in patients with diabetes mellitus across all models.
Comparisons between patients with good and poor functional outcomes, and
multivariate predictions of these outcomes showed the significance of the
association between BrainAGE and post-stroke recovery.
  $\textbf{Conclusion:}$ FL enables accurate age predictions without data
centralization. The strong association between BrainAGE, vascular risk factors,
and post-stroke recovery highlights its potential for prognostic modeling in
stroke care.

TL;DR: AutoRule是一种自动化方法，通过从偏好反馈中提取规则并转化为基于规则的奖励，提升强化学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于规则的奖励方法依赖人工规则设计，AutoRule旨在实现完全自动化。

Method: AutoRule分三阶段：利用推理模型解释用户偏好，从推理链中提取候选规则，并合成统一规则集。使用语言模型验证器计算规则满足度作为辅助奖励。

Result: 在Llama-3-8B模型上，AutoRule在AlpacaEval2.0上相对提升28.6%的胜率，在MT-Bench子集上提升6.1%。

Conclusion: AutoRule提取的规则与数据集偏好一致，减少奖励破解，并能捕捉不同数据集的独特价值。

Abstract: Rule-based rewards offer a promising strategy for improving reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF), but current approaches often rely on
manual rule engineering. We present AutoRule, a fully automated method for
extracting rules from preference feedback and formulating them into rule-based
rewards. AutoRule extraction operates in three stages: it leverages a reasoning
model to interpret user preferences, identifies candidate rules from the
reasoning chain of these interpretations, and synthesizes them into a unified
rule set. Leveraging the finalized rule set, we employ language-model verifiers
to compute the fraction of rules satisfied by each output, using this metric as
an auxiliary reward alongside the learned reward model during policy
optimization. Training a Llama-3-8B model with AutoRule results in a 28.6\%
relative improvement in length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2.0, and a
6.1\% relative gain in second-turn performance on a held-out MT-Bench subset,
compared to a GRPO baseline trained with the same learned reward model but
without the rule-based auxiliary reward. Our analysis confirms that the
extracted rules exhibit good agreement with dataset preference. We find that
AutoRule demonstrates reduced reward hacking compared to a learned reward model
when run over two episodes. Finally, our case study suggests that the extracted
rules capture unique qualities valued in different datasets. The extracted
rules are provided in the appendix, and the code is open-sourced at

Result: 在D4RL基准测试中，CAWR能从次优数据中学习到更优策略，显著提升性能。

Conclusion: CAWR通过鲁棒损失和优先经验回放有效解决了AWR方法因数据质量导致的保守问题。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) algorithms often require
additional constraints or penalty terms to address distribution shift issues,
such as adding implicit or explicit policy constraints during policy
optimization to reduce the estimation bias of functions. This paper focuses on
a limitation of the Advantage-Weighted Regression family (AWRs), i.e., the
potential for learning over-conservative policies due to data corruption,
specifically the poor explorations in suboptimal offline data. We study it from
two perspectives: (1) how poor explorations impact the theoretically optimal
policy based on KL divergence, and (2) how such poor explorations affect the
approximation of the theoretically optimal policy. We prove that such
over-conservatism is mainly caused by the sensitivity of the loss function for
policy optimization to poor explorations, and the proportion of poor
explorations in offline datasets. To address this concern, we propose
Corruption-Averse Advantage-Weighted Regression (CAWR), which incorporates a
set of robust loss functions during policy optimization and an advantage-based
prioritized experience replay method to filter out poor explorations. Numerical
experiments on the D4RL benchmark show that our method can learn superior
policies from suboptimal offline data, significantly enhancing the performance
of policy optimization.

Result: 密集潜在特征形成对偶对，重构残差流中的特定方向，并在不同层中表现出结构、语义和输出导向的功能。

Conclusion: 密集潜在特征是语言模型计算中的功能性组成部分，不应被视为训练噪声。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are designed to extract interpretable features
from language models by enforcing a sparsity constraint. Ideally, training an
SAE would yield latents that are both sparse and semantically meaningful.
However, many SAE latents activate frequently (i.e., are \emph{dense}), raising
concerns that they may be undesirable artifacts of the training procedure. In
this work, we systematically investigate the geometry, function, and origin of
dense latents and show that they are not only persistent but often reflect
meaningful model representations. We first demonstrate that dense latents tend
to form antipodal pairs that reconstruct specific directions in the residual
stream, and that ablating their subspace suppresses the emergence of new dense
features in retrained SAEs -- suggesting that high density features are an
intrinsic property of the residual space. We then introduce a taxonomy of dense
latents, identifying classes tied to position tracking, context binding,
entropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and
principal component reconstruction. Finally, we analyze how these features
evolve across layers, revealing a shift from structural features in early
layers, to semantic features in mid layers, and finally to output-oriented
signals in the last layers of the model. Our findings indicate that dense
latents serve functional roles in language model computation and should not be
dismissed as training noise.

Motivation: 生物神经元网络中突触延迟对学习过程至关重要，但现有SNN模拟中很少包含延迟。

Method: 扩展STDP方法，同时学习突触权重和延迟，并在分类任务的无监督学习SNN模型中验证。

Result: 新方法在多种测试场景中表现优于现有方法，并揭示了突触效能与延迟的相互作用。

Conclusion: 新方法为SNN中突触延迟的学习提供了有效解决方案，并展示了其潜在优势。

Abstract: Synaptic delays play a crucial role in biological neuronal networks, where
their modulation has been observed in mammalian learning processes. In the
realm of neuromorphic computing, although spiking neural networks (SNNs) aim to
emulate biology more closely than traditional artificial neural networks do,
synaptic delays are rarely incorporated into their simulation. We introduce a
novel learning rule for simultaneously learning synaptic connection strengths
and delays, by extending spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), a Hebbian
method commonly used for learning synaptic weights. We validate our approach by
extending a widely-used SNN model for classification trained with unsupervised
learning. Then we demonstrate the effectiveness of our new method by comparing
it against another existing methods for co-learning synaptic weights and delays
as well as against STDP without synaptic delays. Results demonstrate that our
proposed method consistently achieves superior performance across a variety of
test scenarios. Furthermore, our experimental results yield insight into the

### [209] [The Pitfalls and Potentials of Adding Gene-invariance to Optimal Mixing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15222)
*Anton Bouter,Dirk Thierens,Peter A. N. Bosman*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: GI-GOMEA结合了基因不变性技术，改进了GOMEA，解决了种群多样性问题，并在多种问题上表现优异，包括层次性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典OM算法的高选择压力导致种群多样性下降，难以解决层次性问题，需要一种简单且无偏的解决方案。

Method: 受GIGA启发，提出GI-GOMEA，通过保持基因频率不变，与GOMEA结合。

Result: GI-GOMEA在多种问题上优于GOMEA，并能有效解决层次性问题。

Conclusion: GI-GOMEA是一种简单有效的改进方法，适用于复杂优化问题。

Abstract: Optimal Mixing (OM) is a variation operator that integrates local search with
genetic recombination. EAs with OM are capable of state-of-the-art optimization
in discrete spaces, offering significant advantages over classic
recombination-based EAs. This success is partly due to high selection pressure
that drives rapid convergence. However, this can also negatively impact
population diversity, complicating the solving of hierarchical problems, which
feature multiple layers of complexity. While there have been attempts to
address this issue, these solutions are often complicated and prone to bias. To
overcome this, we propose a solution inspired by the Gene Invariant Genetic
Algorithm (GIGA), which preserves gene frequencies in the population throughout
the process. This technique is tailored to and integrated with the Gene-pool
Optimal Mixing Evolutionary Algorithm (GOMEA), resulting in GI-GOMEA. The
simple, yet elegant changes are found to have striking potential: GI-GOMEA
outperforms GOMEA on a range of well-known problems, even when these problems
are adjusted for pitfalls - biases in much-used benchmark problems that can be
easily exploited by maintaining gene invariance. Perhaps even more notably,
GI-GOMEA is also found to be effective at solving hierarchical problems,
including newly introduced asymmetric hierarchical trap functions.

Motivation: 解决漂移分析中手动构造漂移函数和计算线性边界系数的局限性。

Method: 通过击中概率的漂移分析，引入路径处理多模态适应度景观，构建显式表达式计算击中概率。

Result: 能够估计击中时间的上下界，并比较两种算法的性能，应用于背包问题的两种算法分析。

Conclusion: 提出的方法简化了击中时间估计，但两种约束处理技术在性能上无显著差异。

Abstract: Drift analysis is a powerful tool for analyzing the time complexity of
evolutionary algorithms. However, it requires manual construction of drift
functions to bound hitting time for each specific algorithm and problem. To
address this limitation, general linear drift functions were introduced for
elitist evolutionary algorithms. But calculating linear bound coefficients
effectively remains a problem. This paper proposes a new method called drift
analysis of hitting probability to compute these coefficients. Each coefficient
is interpreted as a bound on the hitting probability of a fitness level,
transforming the task of estimating hitting time into estimating hitting
probability. A novel drift analysis method is then developed to estimate
hitting probability, where paths are introduced to handle multimodal fitness
landscapes. Explicit expressions are constructed to compute hitting
probability, significantly simplifying the estimation process. One advantage of
the proposed method is its ability to estimate both the lower and upper bounds
of hitting time and to compare the performance of two algorithms in terms of
hitting time. To demonstrate this application, two algorithms for the knapsack
problem, each incorporating feasibility rules and greedy repair respectively,
are compared. The analysis indicates that neither constraint handling technique
consistently outperforms the other.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了一种基于被动声学监测的野生动物研究方法，使用自动化录音设备（ARUs）收集数据，并通过PNW-Cnet模型实现自动化信号检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手动处理大规模声学数据效率低下，需要自动化工具支持。

Method: 部署ARUs收集声学数据，利用PNW-Cnet模型自动检测目标信号（如物种叫声或环境噪声）。

Result: PNW-Cnet模型已扩展至检测约80种森林野生动物及多种噪声信号。

Conclusion: pycnet-audio提供了一种高效的声学数据处理流程，适用于大规模监测项目。

Abstract: Passive acoustic monitoring is an emerging approach in wildlife research that
leverages recent improvements in purpose-made automated recording units (ARUs).
The general approach is to deploy ARUs in the field to record on a programmed
schedule for extended periods (weeks or months), after which the audio data are
retrieved. These data must then be processed, typically either by measuring or
analyzing characteristics of the audio itself (e.g. calculating acoustic
indices), or by searching for some signal of interest within the recordings,
e.g. vocalizations or other sounds produced by some target species,
anthropogenic or environmental noise, etc. In the latter case, some method is
required to locate the signal(s) of interest within the audio. While very small
datasets can simply be searched manually, even modest projects can produce
audio datasets on the order of 105 hours of recordings, making manual review
impractical and necessitating some form of automated detection. pycnet-audio
(Ruff 2024) is intended to provide a practical processing workflow for acoustic
data, built around the PNW-Cnet model, which was initially developed by the
U.S. Forest Service to support population monitoring of northern spotted owls
(Strix occidentalis caurina) and other forest owls (Lesmeister and Jenkins
2022; Ruff et al. 2020). PNW-Cnet has been expanded to detect vocalizations of
ca. 80 forest wildlife species and numerous forms of anthropogenic and
environmental noise (Ruff et al. 2021, 2023).

Result: U-Net在噪声抑制上表现最佳（SNR提升显著），CMGAN在感知质量上得分最高（PESQ分数领先），而Wave-U-Net在说话人特征保留上更优（VeriSpeak分数提升）。

Conclusion: 研究表明不同模型在语音增强的不同方面各有优势，为实际应用中的权衡选择提供了依据，可能推动语音生物识别、法医音频分析等领域的发展。

Abstract: Speech enhancement, particularly denoising, is vital in improving the
intelligibility and quality of speech signals for real-world applications,
especially in noisy environments. While prior research has introduced various
deep learning models for this purpose, many struggle to balance noise
suppression, perceptual quality, and speaker-specific feature preservation,
leaving a critical research gap in their comparative performance evaluation.
This study benchmarks three state-of-the-art models Wave-U-Net, CMGAN, and
U-Net, on diverse datasets such as SpEAR, VPQAD, and Clarkson datasets. These
models were chosen due to their relevance in the literature and code
accessibility. The evaluation reveals that U-Net achieves high noise
suppression with SNR improvements of +71.96% on SpEAR, +64.83% on VPQAD, and
+364.2% on the Clarkson dataset. CMGAN outperforms in perceptual quality,
attaining the highest PESQ scores of 4.04 on SpEAR and 1.46 on VPQAD, making it
well-suited for applications prioritizing natural and intelligible speech.
Wave-U-Net balances these attributes with improvements in speaker-specific
feature retention, evidenced by VeriSpeak score gains of +10.84% on SpEAR and
+27.38% on VPQAD. This research indicates how advanced methods can optimize
trade-offs between noise suppression, perceptual quality, and speaker
recognition. The findings may contribute to advancing voice biometrics,
forensic audio analysis, telecommunication, and speaker verification in
challenging acoustic conditions.

Motivation: 丰富音乐数据库并推动音乐AI研究，通过生成准确反映音乐特征的详细描述。

Method: 提出多任务模型SonicVerse，结合描述生成与辅助特征检测（如调性检测、人声检测等），通过投影架构将音频和特征输出转换为语言标记。

Result: 实验表明，结合音乐特征提升了生成描述的细节和质量，并能生成时间相关的长音乐描述。

Conclusion: SonicVerse通过多任务框架有效提升音乐描述的丰富性和准确性，为音乐AI研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: Detailed captions that accurately reflect the characteristics of a music
piece can enrich music databases and drive forward research in music AI. This
paper introduces a multi-task music captioning model, SonicVerse, that
integrates caption generation with auxiliary music feature detection tasks such
as key detection, vocals detection, and more, so as to directly capture both
low-level acoustic details as well as high-level musical attributes. The key
contribution is a projection-based architecture that transforms audio input
into language tokens, while simultaneously detecting music features through
dedicated auxiliary heads. The outputs of these heads are also projected into
language tokens, to enhance the captioning input. This framework not only
produces rich, descriptive captions for short music fragments but also directly
enables the generation of detailed time-informed descriptions for longer music
pieces, by chaining the outputs using a large-language model. To train the
model, we extended the MusicBench dataset by annotating it with music features
using MIRFLEX, a modular music feature extractor, resulting in paired audio,
captions and music feature data. Experimental results show that incorporating
features in this way improves the quality and detail of the generated captions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管自动语音识别（ASR）在近年来取得了显著进展，但ALT仍因音乐伴奏的干扰而具有挑战性。音乐源分离技术的进步为提升ALT性能提供了可能，但其效果尚未被系统研究。

Method: 使用Whisper模型评估原始音频、分离人声和人声干声在短篇和长篇转录任务中的表现。针对短篇提出拼接方法，针对长篇提出基于源分离的片段边界检测算法。

Result: 在Jam-ALT长篇基准测试中，该方法实现了开源系统的最佳性能，且无需训练或微调。同时发布了首个公开可用的长篇歌词转录数据集MUSDB-ALT。

Conclusion: 音乐源分离显著提升了ALT性能，提出的方法在开源系统中达到了最先进水平，为未来研究提供了实用工具和数据集。

Abstract: Automatic lyrics transcription (ALT) remains a challenging task in the field
of music information retrieval, despite great advances in automatic speech
recognition (ASR) brought about by transformer-based architectures in recent
years. One of the major challenges in ALT is the high amplitude of interfering
audio signals relative to conventional ASR due to musical accompaniment. Recent
advances in music source separation have enabled automatic extraction of
high-quality separated vocals, which could potentially improve ALT performance.
However, the effect of source separation has not been systematically
investigated in order to establish best practices for its use. This work
examines the impact of source separation on ALT using Whisper, a
state-of-the-art open source ASR model. We evaluate Whisper's performance on
original audio, separated vocals, and vocal stems across short-form and
long-form transcription tasks. For short-form, we suggest a concatenation
method that results in a consistent reduction in Word Error Rate (WER). For
long-form, we propose an algorithm using source separation as a vocal activity
detector to derive segment boundaries, which results in a consistent reduction
in WER relative to Whisper's native long-form algorithm. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results for an open source system on the Jam-ALT long-form ALT
benchmark, without any training or fine-tuning. We also publish MUSDB-ALT, the
first dataset of long-form lyric transcripts following the Jam-ALT guidelines
for which vocal stems are publicly available.

Result: 该方法无需额外训练模型，且不降低生成速度，成功实现了乐器编辑。

Conclusion: 通过合理选择时间步长，可以在不牺牲生成效率的情况下，有效编辑乐器音色。

Abstract: Breakthroughs in text-to-music generation models are transforming the
creative landscape, equipping musicians with innovative tools for composition
and experimentation like never before. However, controlling the generation
process to achieve a specific desired outcome remains a significant challenge.
Even a minor change in the text prompt, combined with the same random seed, can
drastically alter the generated piece. In this paper, we explore the
application of existing text-to-music diffusion models for instrument editing.
Specifically, for an existing audio track, we aim to leverage a pretrained
text-to-music diffusion model to edit the instrument while preserving the
underlying content. Based on the insight that the model first focuses on the
overall structure or content of the audio, then adds instrument information,
and finally refines the quality, we show that selecting a well-chosen
intermediate timestep, identified through an instrument classifier, yields a
balance between preserving the original piece's content and achieving the
desired timbre. Our method does not require additional training of the
text-to-music diffusion model, nor does it compromise the generation process's
speed.

Motivation: 现有音乐AI模型通常依赖人工标注标签，而许多标注（如和弦）可以自然地通过音乐模态本身表达。这为统一理解和生成任务提供了可能。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在和弦识别、旋律生成和鼓轨生成等任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 通过音乐模态的统一建模，论文展示了参数高效解决方案在多任务音乐处理中的潜力，并公开了所有资源。

Abstract: Many music AI models learn a map between music content and human-defined
labels. However, many annotations, such as chords, can be naturally expressed
within the music modality itself, e.g., as sequences of symbolic notes. This
observation enables both understanding tasks (e.g., chord recognition) and
conditional generation tasks (e.g., chord-conditioned melody generation) to be
unified under a music-for-music sequence modeling paradigm. In this work, we
propose parameter-efficient solutions for a variety of symbolic music-for-music
tasks. The high-level idea is that (1) we utilize a pretrained Language Model
(LM) for both the reference and the target sequence and (2) we link these two
LMs via a lightweight adapter. Experiments show that our method achieves
superior performance among different tasks such as chord recognition, melody
generation, and drum track generation. All demos, code and model weights are
publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统TTS训练需要高质量、对齐良好的数据，限制了可扩展性和说话人多样性。TTSOps旨在利用现代TTS模型的噪声鲁棒性，并通过低质量但信息丰富的样本提升性能。

Method: TTSOps包含三个核心组件：1) 从“暗数据”自动收集数据；2) 基于训练数据质量的动态数据清洗方法选择；3) 使用预测MOS评分进行闭环数据选择。

Result: 在日语YouTube数据上的实验表明，TTSOps在合成语音的自然度和说话人多样性上优于传统基于声学质量的方法。

Conclusion: TTSOps通过闭环优化数据选择和模型训练，显著提升了TTS系统的性能和实用性。

Abstract: This paper presents TTSOps, a fully automated closed-loop framework for
constructing multi-speaker text-to-speech (TTS) systems from noisy, uncurated
web-scale speech data, often referred to as ``dark data,'' such as online
videos. Conventional TTS training pipelines require well-curated corpora with
high acoustic quality and accurate text-speech alignment, which severely limits
scalability, speaker diversity, and real-world applicability. While recent
studies have proposed acoustic-quality-based data selection techniques, they
often overlook two critical aspects: (1) the inherent robustness of modern TTS
models to noise, and (2) the potential contribution of perceptually low-quality
yet informative samples. To address these issues, TTSOps introduces a
data-centric training pipeline that integrates three core components: (1)
automated data collection from dark data sources, (2) utterance-level dynamic
selection of data cleansing methods based on training data quality, and (3)
evaluation-in-the-loop data selection using automatically predicted mean
opinion scores (MOS) to estimate each utterance's impact on model performance.
Furthermore, TTSOps jointly optimizes the corpus and the TTS model in a
closed-loop framework by dynamically adapting both data selection and data
cleansing processes to the characteristics of the target TTS model. Extensive
experiments on Japanese YouTube data demonstrate that TTSOps outperforms
conventional acoustic-quality-based baselines in both the naturalness and
speaker diversity of synthesized speech.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于混合交通环境中联网自动驾驶车辆（CAV）的长时自主控制器，重点解决允许红灯右转的交叉路口问题，通过控制屏障函数（CBFs）确保安全性和实时可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自动驾驶车辆的快速普及，混合交通环境成为下一代移动系统的关键组成部分，而V2I（车与基础设施通信）的集成仍是一个具有挑战性的问题。

Method: 首先推导自由流交通下CAV的最优控制策略，然后利用CBFs将智能交通灯的穿越时间约束映射为控制器边界，并实时识别可行穿越间隔。

Result: 通过MATLAB仿真验证了控制策略的可行性，确保CAV在指定时间间隔内安全穿越交叉路口。

Conclusion: 提出的控制策略不仅兼容CAV和HDV，还能始终提供可行的解决方案，为混合交通环境中的自主控制提供了有效方法。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of autonomous vehicle has established mixed traffic
environments, comprising both autonomous and human-driven vehicles (HDVs), as
essential components of next-generation mobility systems. Along these lines,
connectivity between autonomous vehicles and infrastructure (V2I) is also a
significant factor that can effectively support higher-level decision-making.
At the same time, the integration of V2I within mixed traffic environments
remains a timely and challenging problem. In this paper, we present a
long-duration autonomy controller for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs)
operating in such environments, with a focus on intersections where right turns
on red are permitted. We begin by deriving the optimal control policy for CAVs
under free-flow traffic. Next, we analyze crossing time constraints imposed by
smart traffic lights and map these constraints to controller bounds using
Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), with the aim to drive a CAV to cross the
intersection on time. We also introduce criteria for identifying, in real-time,
feasible crossing intervals for each CAV. To ensure safety for the CAVs, we
present model-agnostic safety guarantees, and demonstrate their compatibility
with both CAVs and HDVs. Ultimately, the final control actions are enforced
through a combination of CBF constraints, constraining CAVs to traverse the
intersection within the designated time intervals while respecting other
vehicles. Finally, we guarantee that our control policy yields always a
feasible solution and validate the proposed approach through extensive
simulations in MATLAB.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in autonomous vehicle (AV) technology promise enhanced
safety and operational efficiency. However, frequent lane changes and merging
maneuvers continue to pose significant safety risks and disrupt traffic flow.
This paper introduces the Minimizing Lane Change Algorithm (MLCA), a
state-machine-based approach designed to reduce unnecessary lane changes,
thereby enhancing both traffic safety and efficiency. The MLCA algorithm
prioritizes maintaining lane stability unless safety-critical conditions
necessitate a lane change. The algorithm's effectiveness was evaluated through
simulations conducted on the SUMO platform, comparing its performance against
established models, including LC2017 and MOBIL. Results demonstrate substantial
reductions in lane changes and collisions, leading to smoother traffic flow and
improved safety metrics. Additionally, the study highlights the MLCA's
adaptability to various traffic densities and roadway configurations,
showcasing its potential for wide-scale deployment in real-world AV systems.
Future work aims to validate these findings in more complex scenarios using the
CARLA simulator, which will enable the testing of the algorithm under more
dynamic and high-fidelity conditions, such as urban traffic environments with
diverse road users. Moreover, the integration of cybersecurity measures for
vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication will be explored to ensure robust and
secure data exchange, further enhancing the reliability and safety of AV
operations. This research contributes to the broader goal of developing
intelligent traffic systems that optimize both individual vehicle performance
and overall traffic network efficiency.

Result: 实验证实了FOM_SILD的互易性，仿真显示其与误码率（BER）趋势高度相关。

Conclusion: 该方法为下一代超高速互连中的偏斜分析提供了可靠的框架。

Abstract: The rise of AI workloads and growing data center demands have driven the need
for ultra-high-speed interconnects exceeding 200 Gb/s. As unit intervals (UI)
shrink, even a few picoseconds of P/N skew can degrade serializer-deserializer
(SerDes) performance. Traditional methods for quantifying skew fall short in
capturing its impact. We introduce two new metrics: 1) Skew-Induced Insertion
Loss Deviation (SILD) and 2) its complementary Figure of Merit (FOM_SILD),
analytically developed to assess P/N skew effects. Measured S-parameters
confirm FOM_SILD reciprocity, while simulations of 224G PAM4 SerDes show strong
correlation with bit error rate (BER) trends. This approach offers a robust
framework for analyzing skew in next-generation ultra-high-speed interconnects.

Conclusion: 首次实现噪声梯度下的精确收敛和差分隐私，量化了隐私成本。

Abstract: Distributed aggregative optimization underpins many cooperative optimization
and multi-agent control systems, where each agent's objective function depends
both on its local optimization variable and an aggregate of all agents'
optimization variables. Existing distributed aggregative optimization
approaches typically require access to accurate gradients of the objective
functions, which, however, are often hard to obtain in real-world applications.
For example, in machine learning, gradients are commonly contaminated by two
main sources of noise: the randomness inherent in sampled data, and the
additional variability introduced by mini-batch computations. In addition to
the issue of relying on accurate gradients, existing distributed aggregative
optimization approaches require agents to share explicit information, which
could breach the privacy of participating agents. We propose an algorithm that
can solve both problems with existing distributed aggregative optimization
approaches: not only can the proposed algorithm guarantee mean-square
convergence to an exact optimal solution when the gradients are subject to
noise, it also simultaneously ensures rigorous differential privacy, with the
cumulative privacy budget guaranteed to be finite even when the number of
iterations tends to infinity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
algorithm able to guarantee both accurate convergence and rigorous differential
privacy in distributed aggregative optimization. Besides characterizing the
convergence rates under nonconvex/convex/strongly convex conditions, we also
rigorously quantify the cost of differential privacy in terms of convergence
rates. Experimental results on personalized machine learning using benchmark
datasets confirm the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: This paper proposes an upper-limb exoskeleton teleoperation system based on
magnetorheological (MR) clutches, aiming to improve operational accuracy and
enhance the immersive experience during lunar sampling tasks. Conventional
exoskeleton teleoperation systems commonly employ active force feedback
solutions, such as servo motors, which typically suffer from high system
complexity and increased energy consumption. Furthermore, force feedback
devices utilizing motors and gear reducers generally compromise backdrivability
and pose safety risks to operators due to active force output. To address these
limitations, we propose a semi-active force feedback strategy based on MR
clutches. Dynamic magnetic field control enables precise adjustment of joint
stiffness and damping, thereby providing smooth and high-resolution force
feedback. The designed MR clutch exhibits outstanding performance across key
metrics, achieving a torque-to-mass ratio (TMR) of 93.6 Nm/kg, a
torque-to-volume ratio (TVR) of 4.05 x 10^5 Nm/m^3, and a torque-to-power ratio
(TPR) of 4.15 Nm/W. Notably, the TMR represents an improvement of approximately
246% over a representative design in prior work. Experimental results validate
the system's capability to deliver high-fidelity force feedback. Overall, the
proposed system presents a promising solution for deep-space teleoperation with
strong potential for real-world deployment in future missions.

Abstract: With the increasing prevalence of distributed generators, islanded operation
based on distributed generation is considered a vital means to enhance the
reliability and resilience of smart grids. This paper investigates the main
factors in islanding partition of smart grids and establishes a mathematical
model for islanding division. A method to determine the maximum power supply
range of distributed energy resources (DERs) based on the reachability matrix
and power circle algorithm is proposed to improve computational efficiency. A
dynamic programming method based on breadth-first search (BFS) is used to solve
the islanding partition scheme, and a region correction method is applied to
modify the maximum power supply area by considering controllable loads and
prioritizing critical load restoration, thereby enhancing system resilience.
Finally, simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm
in improving smart grid resilience.

Abstract: Modern low-carbon power systems come with many challenges, such as increased
inverter penetration and increased uncertainty from renewable sources and
loads. In this context, the microgrid concept is a promising approach, which is
based on a segmentation of the grid into independent smaller cells that can run
either in grid-connected or standalone mode.In microgrids, droop control is
widely used for primary control. It enables proportional power sharing,
depending on the droop gains. Operation control schemes considering droop
control often assume fixed droop gains. However, using adaptive droop gains for
grid-forming units allow to shape power sharing in presence of fluctuations,
enhancing flexibility while maintaining a safe microgrid operation,
particularly under uncertainty. This work introduces a bilinear formulation for
microgrid operation control that finds optimal power setpoints and droop gains
on a timescale of minutes by solving a finite horizon optimization problem. In
detail, a robust minmax model predictive control scheme is designed for a
standalone microgrid, comprising a fuel cell, a photovoltaic system and an
energy storage. Closed-loop simulations are performed with and without variable
droop gains. The results show an increase in renewable utilization of up to 7.5
% while reducing the power output of the fuel cell by 6 %, when allowing
variable droop gains.

Result: 无模型控制为闭环DBS提供了一种现代控制方法，有望优化治疗效果。

Conclusion: 无模型控制方法为闭环DBS的临床应用提供了新思路，可能克服现有技术的局限性。

Abstract: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an advanced surgical treatment for the
symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), involving electrical stimulation of
neurons within the basal ganglia region of the brain. DBS is traditionally
delivered in an open-loop manner using fixed stimulation parameters, which may
lead to suboptimal results. In an effort to overcome these limitations, closed
loop DBS, using pathological subthalamic beta (13--30 Hz) activity as a
feedback signal, offers the potential to adapt DBS automatically in response to
changes in patient symptoms and side effects. However, clinically implemented
closed-loop techniques have been limited to date to simple control algorithms,
due to the inherent uncertainties in the dynamics involved. Model-free control,
which has already seen successful applications in the field of bioengineering,
offers a way to avoid this limitation and provides an alternative method to
apply modern control approach to selective suppression of pathological
oscillations.

Abstract: This study focuses on the novel municipal-scale rural integrated energy
system (RIES), which encompasses energy supply and application. By constructing
a seven-dimensional evaluation system including energy efficiency, energy
supply, low-carbon sustainability, environmental impact, energy economy, social
benefits, and integrated energy system development, this research combines the
improved analytic hierarchy process (IAHP) and entropy weight method (EWM) by
sum of squares of deviations to balance expert experience and data objectivity.
Furthermore, the cloud model is introduced to handle the fuzziness and
randomness in the evaluation. This method can quantify the differences in
system performance before and after the planning implementation. The results
indicate that after planning, the comprehensive score has increased from 83.12
to 87.55, the entropy value has decreased from 6.931 to 5.336, indicating
enhanced system stability. The hyper-entropy has dropped from 3.08 to 2.278,
reflecting a reduction in uncertainty. The research findings provide a
scientific basis for the planning optimization, policy-making, and sustainable
development of rural integrated energy systems, possessing both theoretical
innovation and practical guiding value.

Conclusion: MPC路径跟随方法在四旋翼无人机上具有实用性和灵活性，为复杂任务自动化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Automating drone-assisted processes is a complex task. Many solutions rely on
trajectory generation and tracking, whereas in contrast, path-following control
is a particularly promising approach, offering an intuitive and natural
approach to automate tasks for drones and other vehicles. While different
solutions to the path-following problem have been proposed, most of them lack
the capability to explicitly handle state and input constraints, are formulated
in a conservative two-stage approach, or are only applicable to linear systems.
To address these challenges, the paper is built upon a Model Predictive
Control-based path-following framework and extends its application to the
Crazyflie quadrotor, which is investigated in hardware experiments. A cascaded
control structure including an underlying attitude controller is included in
the Model Predictive Path-Following Control formulation to meet the challenging
real-time demands of quadrotor control. The effectiveness of the proposed
method is demonstrated through real-world experiments, representing, to the
best of the authors' knowledge, a novel application of this MPC-based
path-following approach to the quadrotor. Additionally, as an extension to the
original method, to allow for deviations of the path in cases where the precise
following of the path might be overly restrictive, a corridor path-following
approach is presented.

Abstract: This article addresses the problem of data-driven numerical optimal control
for unknown nonlinear systems. In our scenario, we suppose to have the
possibility of performing multiple experiments (or simulations) on the system.
Experiments are performed by relying on a data-driven tracking controller able
to steer the system towards a desired reference. Our proposed DATA-DRIVEN
PRONTO algorithm iteratively refines a tentative solution of the optimal
control problem by computing an approximate descent direction via a local
trajectory perturbation. At each iteration, multiple trajectories are gathered
by perturbing the current trajectory with a suitable dither signal, and then
used to obtain a data-driven, time-varying linearization. The exploration is
guided by the tracking controller, so that perturbed trajectories are obtained
in closed loop. We show local convergence of DATA-DRIVEN PRONTO to a ball about
an isolated optimal solution, whose radius depends on the amplitude of the
dither signal. We corroborate the theoretical results by applying it to an
underactuated robot.

Conclusion: 提出的框架能准确学习分数阶系统动态，分数阶模型优于整数阶模型。

Abstract: This paper presents a data-integrated framework for learning the dynamics of
fractional-order nonlinear systems in both discrete-time and continuous-time
settings. The proposed framework consists of two main steps. In the first step,
input-output experiments are designed to generate the necessary datasets for
learning the system dynamics, including the fractional order, the drift vector
field, and the control vector field. In the second step, these datasets, along
with the memory-dependent property of fractional-order systems, are used to
estimate the system's fractional order. The drift and control vector fields are
then reconstructed using orthonormal basis functions. To validate the proposed
approach, the algorithm is applied to four benchmark fractional-order systems.
The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework in learning the
system dynamics accurately. Finally, the same datasets are used to learn
equivalent integer-order models. The numerical comparisons demonstrate that
fractional-order models better capture long-range dependencies, highlighting
the limitations of integer-order representations.
