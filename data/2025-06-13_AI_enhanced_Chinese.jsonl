Despite recent progress, significant challenges remain due to\nthe semantic gap between music and dance motion, as music offers only abstract\ncues, such as melody, groove, and emotion, without explicitly specifying the\nphysical movements.

This is suboptimal because resampling can\nintroduce artifacts due to interpolation. To address this, we present\nRealKeyMorph (RKM), a resolution-agnostic method for image registration. RKM is\nan extension of KeyMorph, a registration framework which works by training a\nnetwork to learn corresponding keypoints for a given pair of images, after\nwhich a closed-form keypoint matching step is used to derive the transformation\nthat aligns them. To avoid resampling and enable operating on the raw data, RKM\noutputs keypoints in real-world coordinates of the scanner. To do this, we\nleverage the affine matrix produced by the scanner (e.g., MRI machine) that\nencodes the mapping from voxel coordinates to real world coordinates.

Despite some progress, the lack of high-quality\nreal-world datasets hinders the development of trustworthy detectors. In this\npaper, we propose GenWorld, a large-scale, high-quality, and real-world\nsimulation dataset for AI-generated video detection. GenWorld features the\nfollowing characteristics: (1) Real-world Simulation: GenWorld focuses on\nvideos that replicate real-world scenarios, which have a significant impact due\nto their realism and potential influence; (2) High Quality: GenWorld employs\nmultiple state-of-the-art video generation models to provide realistic and\nhigh-quality forged videos; (3) Cross-prompt Diversity: GenWorld includes\nvideos generated from diverse generators and various prompt modalities (e.g.,\ntext, image, video), offering the potential to learn more generalizable\nforensic features. We analyze existing methods and find they fail to detect\nhigh-quality videos generated by world models (i.e., Cosmos), revealing\npotential drawbacks of ignoring real-world clues.
