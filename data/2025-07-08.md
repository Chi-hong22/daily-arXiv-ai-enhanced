Motivation: 研究驾驶受损（酒精中毒和认知分心）对驾驶行为的影响，以减少社会成本。

Method: 收集了23.7小时的模拟城市驾驶数据，52名受试者在正常和受损条件下驾驶，包括车辆和驾驶员数据。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in automated driving technology, impaired driving
continues to incur a high cost to society. In this paper, we present a driving
dataset designed to support the study of two common forms of driver impairment:
alcohol intoxication and cognitive distraction. Our dataset spans 23.7 hours of
simulated urban driving, with 52 human subjects under normal and impaired
conditions, and includes both vehicle data (ground truth perception, vehicle
pose, controls) and driver-facing data (gaze, audio, surveys). It supports
analysis of changes in driver behavior due to alcohol intoxication (0.10\%
blood alcohol content), two forms of cognitive distraction (audio n-back and
sentence parsing tasks), and combinations thereof, as well as responses to a
set of eight controlled road hazards, such as vehicle cut-ins. The dataset will
be made available at https://toyotaresearchinstitute.github.io/IDD/.

### [2] [Learning to Generate Vectorized Maps at Intersections with Multiple Roadside Cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02899)
*Miao Fan,Quanxin Zheng,Shengtong Xu,Linghe Kong,Haoyi Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MRC-VMap是一种基于视觉的端到端神经网络，通过利用路边监控摄像头生成高精度矢量地图，降低了成本并提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖昂贵的LiDAR数据或性能有限的摄像头，难以在复杂路口高效生成矢量地图。

Method: 利用多方向摄像头图像直接生成矢量地图，减少中间模块和计算开销。

Result: 在4000个中国城市路口的实验中，性能优于现有在线方法，接近LiDAR精度。

Conclusion: MRC-VMap为自动驾驶提供了一种高效、可扩展的矢量地图生成方案。

Abstract: Vectorized maps are indispensable for precise navigation and the safe
operation of autonomous vehicles. Traditional methods for constructing these
maps fall into two categories: offline techniques, which rely on expensive,
labor-intensive LiDAR data collection and manual annotation, and online
approaches that use onboard cameras to reduce costs but suffer from limited
performance, especially at complex intersections. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MRC-VMap, a cost-effective, vision-centric, end-to-end neural network
designed to generate high-definition vectorized maps directly at intersections.
Leveraging existing roadside surveillance cameras, MRC-VMap directly converts
time-aligned, multi-directional images into vectorized map representations.
This integrated solution lowers the need for additional intermediate
modules--such as separate feature extraction and Bird's-Eye View (BEV)
conversion steps--thus reducing both computational overhead and error
propagation. Moreover, the use of multiple camera views enhances mapping
completeness, mitigates occlusions, and provides robust performance under
practical deployment constraints. Extensive experiments conducted on 4,000
intersections across 4 major metropolitan areas in China demonstrate that
MRC-VMap not only outperforms state-of-the-art online methods but also achieves
accuracy comparable to high-cost LiDAR-based approaches, thereby offering a
scalable and efficient solution for modern autonomous navigation systems.

Method: 评估MLLMs在分类网球动作及识别动作序列中的表现，并探索通过不同训练方法及与传统模型结合提升其性能。

Result: 未明确提及具体结果，但研究重点在于填补现有技术空白。

Conclusion: MLLMs在网球视频分析中具有潜力，未来可通过改进训练方法进一步提升其性能。

Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recent years has also given rise
to the development of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). These new MLLMs allow us to
process images, videos and even audio alongside textual inputs. In this
project, we aim to assess the effectiveness of MLLMs in analysing sports
videos, focusing mainly on tennis videos. Despite research done on tennis
analysis, there remains a gap in models that are able to understand and
identify the sequence of events in a tennis rally, which would be useful in
other fields of sports analytics. As such, we will mainly assess the MLLMs on
their ability to fill this gap - to classify tennis actions, as well as their
ability to identify these actions in a sequence of tennis actions in a rally.
We further looked into ways we can improve the MLLMs' performance, including
different training methods and even using them together with other traditional
models.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive video-based analytics framework for tennis doubles
that addresses the lack of automated analysis tools for this strategically
complex sport. Our approach introduces a standardised annotation methodology
encompassing player positioning, shot types, court formations, and match
outcomes, coupled with a specialised annotation tool designed to meet the
unique requirements of tennis video labelling. The framework integrates
advanced machine learning techniques including GroundingDINO for precise player
localisation through natural language grounding and YOLO-Pose for robust pose
estimation. This combination significantly reduces manual annotation effort
whilst improving data consistency and quality. We evaluate our approach on
doubles tennis match data and demonstrate that CNN-based models with transfer
learning substantially outperform pose-based methods for predicting shot types,
player positioning, and formations. The CNN models effectively capture complex
visual and contextual features essential for doubles tennis analysis. Our
integrated system bridges advanced analytical capabilities with the strategic
complexities of tennis doubles, providing a foundation for automated tactical
analysis, performance evaluation, and strategic modelling in professional
tennis.

Result: 评估了每种方法的预测准确性、多模态性和推理效率，提供了全面的分析。

Conclusion: 本文为联合运动预测提供了系统比较，揭示了不同方法的优势和局限性。

Abstract: Accurate motion prediction of surrounding traffic participants is crucial for
the safe and efficient operation of automated vehicles in dynamic environments.
Marginal prediction models commonly forecast each agent's future trajectories
independently, often leading to sub-optimal planning decisions for an automated
vehicle. In contrast, joint prediction models explicitly account for the
interactions between agents, yielding socially and physically consistent
predictions on a scene level. However, existing approaches differ not only in
their problem formulation but also in the model architectures and
implementation details used, making it difficult to compare them. In this work,
we systematically investigate different approaches to joint motion prediction,
including post-processing of the marginal predictions, explicitly training the
model for joint predictions, and framing the problem as a generative task. We
evaluate each approach in terms of prediction accuracy, multi-modality, and
inference efficiency, offering a comprehensive analysis of the strengths and
limitations of each approach. Several prediction examples are available at
https://frommarginaltojointpred.github.io/.

Motivation: 食物不安全是城市公共卫生问题，现有调查方法难以扩展，需探索更高效的识别手段。

Method: 提出两步法：特征提取和门控注意力图像聚合，并与其他模型架构对比评估。

Result: 模型预测能力略低，但权重解释和案例研究表明其潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法可辅助城市规划者和政策制定者识别食物不安全问题。

Abstract: Food insecurity is a significant social and public health issue that plagues
many urban metropolitan areas around the world. Existing approaches to
identifying food insecurity rely primarily on qualitative and quantitative
survey data, which is difficult to scale. This project seeks to explore the
effectiveness of using street-level images in modeling food insecurity at the
census tract level. To do so, we propose a two-step process of feature
extraction and gated attention for image aggregation. We evaluate the
effectiveness of our model by comparing against other model architectures,
interpreting our learned weights, and performing a case study. While our model
falls slightly short in terms of its predictive power, we believe our approach
still has the potential to supplement existing methods of identifying food
insecurity for urban planners and policymakers.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的伪标签框架，仅使用视频数据，无需多视角设置或额外传感器，解决了单目3D目标检测中的数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目3D目标检测面临数据稀缺和2D到3D的模糊性问题，现有方法受限于领域特定学习或单一观测的形状信息。

Result: 实验表明，该方法具有可靠的准确性和强扩展性。

Conclusion: 该方法为单目3D目标检测提供了一种实用且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) has long faced challenges due to data
scarcity caused by high annotation costs and inherent 2D-to-3D ambiguity.
Although various weakly supervised methods and pseudo-labeling methods have
been proposed to address these issues, they are mostly limited by
domain-specific learning or rely solely on shape information from a single
observation. In this paper, we propose a novel pseudo-labeling framework that
uses only video data and is more robust to occlusion, without requiring a
multi-view setup, additional sensors, camera poses, or domain-specific
training. Specifically, we explore a technique for aggregating the
pseudo-LiDARs of both static and dynamic objects across temporally adjacent
frames using object point tracking, enabling 3D attribute extraction in
scenarios where 3D data acquisition is infeasible. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method ensures reliable accuracy and strong scalability,
making it a practical and effective solution for M3OD.

Result: 在链式检索任务中优于场景方法，支持零样本环境识别。

Conclusion: OBSER框架为环境理解提供了可靠且高效的方法。

Abstract: We present the Object-Based Sub-Environment Recognition (OBSER) framework, a
novel Bayesian framework that infers three fundamental relationships between
sub-environments and their constituent objects. In the OBSER framework, metric
and self-supervised learning models estimate the object distributions of
sub-environments on the latent space to compute these measures. Both
theoretically and empirically, we validate the proposed framework by
introducing the ($\epsilon,\delta$) statistically separable (EDS) function
which indicates the alignment of the representation. Our framework reliably
performs inference in open-world and photorealistic environments and
outperforms scene-based methods in chained retrieval tasks. The OBSER framework
enables zero-shot recognition of environments to achieve autonomous environment
understanding.

### [10] [GameTileNet: A Semantic Dataset for Low-Resolution Game Art in Procedural Content Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02941)
*Yi-Chun Chen,Arnav Jhala*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GameTileNet是一个低分辨率游戏图块的语义数据集，旨在通过视觉-语言对齐支持叙事驱动的程序化内容生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI生成游戏视觉内容与叙事不一致的问题，以及训练数据分布不平衡导致的多样性受限。

Method: 收集OpenGameArt.org上艺术家创作的游戏图块，提供语义标注，并开发低分辨率图块对象检测流程。

Result: 数据集支持叙事驱动的内容生成，为低分辨率非真实感图像的对象检测提供基准。

Conclusion: GameTileNet是改进程序化内容生成方法、丰富游戏叙事的宝贵资源。

Abstract: GameTileNet is a dataset designed to provide semantic labels for
low-resolution digital game art, advancing procedural content generation (PCG)
and related AI research as a vision-language alignment task. Large Language
Models (LLMs) and image-generative AI models have enabled indie developers to
create visual assets, such as sprites, for game interactions. However,
generating visuals that align with game narratives remains challenging due to
inconsistent AI outputs, requiring manual adjustments by human artists. The
diversity of visual representations in automatically generated game content is
also limited because of the imbalance in distributions across styles for
training data. GameTileNet addresses this by collecting artist-created game
tiles from OpenGameArt.org under Creative Commons licenses and providing
semantic annotations to support narrative-driven content generation. The
dataset introduces a pipeline for object detection in low-resolution tile-based
game art (e.g., 32x32 pixels) and annotates semantics, connectivity, and object
classifications. GameTileNet is a valuable resource for improving PCG methods,
supporting narrative-rich game content, and establishing a baseline for object
detection in low-resolution, non-photorealistic images.
  TL;DR: GameTileNet is a semantic dataset of low-resolution game tiles
designed to support narrative-driven procedural content generation through
visual-language alignment.

### [11] [Iterative Zoom-In: Temporal Interval Exploration for Long Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02946)
*Chenglin Li,Qianglong Chen,fengtao,Yin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Temporal Search（TS）的无训练框架，通过迭代调整时间焦点来提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）对长视频的理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在处理长视频时因时间感知效率低下而表现不佳，TS旨在通过动态调整时间焦点来解决这一问题。

Method: TS通过两个迭代阶段工作：1）提出可能包含任务相关信息的时间区间；2）从区间中采样固定数量帧，生成响应和置信度分数。TS-BFS进一步引入最佳优先搜索策略。

Result: TS通过动态调整时间焦点，提高了MLLMs对长视频的理解能力，同时降低了内存消耗和关键信息遗漏的风险。

Conclusion: TS为长视频理解提供了一种高效且无需额外训练的方法，显著提升了MLLMs的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong performance in
video understanding tasks. However, they continue to struggle with long-form
videos because of an inefficient perception of temporal intervals. Unlike
humans, who can dynamically adjust their temporal focus to locate
query-relevant moments, current MLLMs often rely on dense, uniform sampling
across the video timeline, leading to high memory consumption and a risk of
missing crucial information. To address this challenge, we introduce Temporal
Search, a training-free framework that enables MLLMs to explore temporal
regions for improved long video understanding iteratively. TS is based on a key
observation: the model's generation confidence across different temporal
intervals is highly correlated with prediction accuracy. TS operates through
two main iterative stages. First, the MLLM proposes a temporal interval that is
likely to contain task-relevant information. Then, it samples a fixed number of
frames from the interval, regardless of length, and feeds them into the model
to produce a refined response and confidence score. TS refines the focus of the
model by iteratively shifting attention to more fine-grained temporal
intervals, improving its understanding of long videos. Additionally,
keyframe-level descriptions are collected to facilitate cross-interval
perception throughout the video. To further improve efficiency, we introduce
TS-BFS, a best-first search strategy over a tree. Each node represents a
candidate interval and is expanded via two methods: self-driven proposals and
uniform partitioning. Nodes are scored based on confidence and self-evaluation,
and the most promising one is selected for continued exploration.

Result: 实验显示，DriveMRP-Agent显著提升VLM的事故识别准确率（27.13%至88.03%），并在零样本测试中实现从29.42%到68.50%的飞跃。

Conclusion: DriveMRP-10K和DriveMRP-Agent有效提升VLM的运动风险预测能力，并展示出强大的泛化性能。

Abstract: Autonomous driving has seen significant progress, driven by extensive
real-world data. However, in long-tail scenarios, accurately predicting the
safety of the ego vehicle's future motion remains a major challenge due to
uncertainties in dynamic environments and limitations in data coverage. In this
work, we aim to explore whether it is possible to enhance the motion risk
prediction capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLM) by synthesizing
high-risk motion data. Specifically, we introduce a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) based
motion simulation method to model risks from three aspects: the ego-vehicle,
other vehicles, and the environment. This allows us to synthesize
plug-and-play, high-risk motion data suitable for VLM training, which we call
DriveMRP-10K. Furthermore, we design a VLM-agnostic motion risk estimation
framework, named DriveMRP-Agent. This framework incorporates a novel
information injection strategy for global context, ego-vehicle perspective, and
trajectory projection, enabling VLMs to effectively reason about the spatial
relationships between motion waypoints and the environment. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that by fine-tuning with DriveMRP-10K, our
DriveMRP-Agent framework can significantly improve the motion risk prediction
performance of multiple VLM baselines, with the accident recognition accuracy
soaring from 27.13% to 88.03%. Moreover, when tested via zero-shot evaluation
on an in-house real-world high-risk motion dataset, DriveMRP-Agent achieves a
significant performance leap, boosting the accuracy from base_model's 29.42% to
68.50%, which showcases the strong generalization capabilities of our method in
real-world scenarios.

Result: 配准精度在2.7毫米内，实现了对眼角区域的精确定位。

Conclusion: 该方法为发热筛查提供了高精度的定位技术，适用于公共场所的温度监测。

Abstract: Fever screening based on infrared thermographs (IRTs) is a viable mass
screening approach during infectious disease pandemics, such as Ebola and SARS,
for temperature monitoring in public places like hospitals and airports. IRTs
have found to be powerful, quick and non-invasive methods to detect elevated
temperatures. Moreover, regions medially adjacent to the inner canthi (called
the canthi regions in this paper) are preferred sites for fever screening.
Accurate localization of the canthi regions can be achieved through multi-modal
registration of infrared (IR) and white-light images. We proposed a
registration method through a coarse-fine registration strategy using different
registration models based on landmarks and edge detection on eye contours. We
evaluated the registration accuracy to be within 2.7 mm, which enables accurate
localization of the canthi regions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有3D纹理生成方法因依赖多视图图像和后期处理导致的误差累积和空间不一致问题。

Method: SeqTex将任务重新定义为序列生成问题，结合多视图渲染和UV纹理的联合分布，并引入解耦分支设计、几何感知注意力等创新架构。

Result: SeqTex在图像和文本条件3D纹理生成任务中表现最优，具有更高的3D一致性、纹理几何对齐和泛化能力。

Conclusion: SeqTex通过端到端设计和预训练视频模型的利用，显著提升了3D纹理生成的质量和效率。

Abstract: Training native 3D texture generative models remains a fundamental yet
challenging problem, largely due to the limited availability of large-scale,
high-quality 3D texture datasets. This scarcity hinders generalization to
real-world scenarios. To address this, most existing methods finetune
foundation image generative models to exploit their learned visual priors.
However, these approaches typically generate only multi-view images and rely on
post-processing to produce UV texture maps -- an essential representation in
modern graphics pipelines. Such two-stage pipelines often suffer from error
accumulation and spatial inconsistencies across the 3D surface. In this paper,
we introduce SeqTex, a novel end-to-end framework that leverages the visual
knowledge encoded in pretrained video foundation models to directly generate
complete UV texture maps. Unlike previous methods that model the distribution
of UV textures in isolation, SeqTex reformulates the task as a sequence
generation problem, enabling the model to learn the joint distribution of
multi-view renderings and UV textures. This design effectively transfers the
consistent image-space priors from video foundation models into the UV domain.
To further enhance performance, we propose several architectural innovations: a
decoupled multi-view and UV branch design, geometry-informed attention to guide
cross-domain feature alignment, and adaptive token resolution to preserve fine
texture details while maintaining computational efficiency. Together, these
components allow SeqTex to fully utilize pretrained video priors and synthesize
high-fidelity UV texture maps without the need for post-processing. Extensive
experiments show that SeqTex achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
image-conditioned and text-conditioned 3D texture generation tasks, with
superior 3D consistency, texture-geometry alignment, and real-world
generalization.

*Andrew Kiruluta,Preethi Raju,Priscilla Burity*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CSAT是一种新型注意力机制，通过压缩感知降低计算复杂度，适用于视觉语言模型（vLLMs）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准注意力机制在vLLMs中因跨模态计算导致高内存和延迟成本，CSAT旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用随机测量矩阵将高维键值投影到低维子空间，并通过稀疏恢复算法重构注意力输出。

Result: CSAT显著降低了注意力复杂度，同时保持语义保真度，适用于视频和语言的多模态任务。

Conclusion: CSAT为下一代多模态Transformer提供了可扩展、高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (vLLMs) have emerged as powerful architectures for
joint reasoning over visual and textual inputs, enabling breakthroughs in image
captioning, cross modal retrieval, and multimodal dialogue. However, as these
models scale to longer video sequences and richer language descriptions, the
quadratic complexity of the standard attention mechanism presents a fundamental
computational bottleneck. This challenge is exacerbated in vLLMs, where
attention must be computed not only within modalities but also across them,
leading to prohibitive memory and latency costs. In this work, we introduce the
Compressed Sensing Attention Transformer (CSAT), a novel architecture that
reimagines attention computation through the lens of compressed sensing. By
projecting high dimensional key and value representations into a
lower-dimensional subspace via random measurement matrices and reconstructing
the attention outputs using sparse recovery algorithms, CSAT significantly
reduces attention complexity while maintaining semantic fidelity. Applied to
vLLMs, CSAT exploits the inherent compressibility of both visual and textual
representations especially evident in video, where temporal redundancy is high,
and in language, where cross-modal grounding is often sparse. In contrast to
LLMs, which must often model entangled symbolic dependencies, vLLMs benefit
from structured sparsity in alignment and scene composition, making them
particularly well-suited to compressed attention. We provide a formal
mathematical treatment of CSAT, demonstrate its integration into vision
language pipelines, and validate its performance on standard benchmarks,
highlighting its promise as a scalable, interpretable, and resource efficient
solution for next generation multimodal transformers.

Abstract: The integration of large-scale circuits and systems emphasizes the importance
of automated defect detection of electronic components. The YOLO image
detection model has been used to detect PCB defects and it has become a typical
AI-assisted case of traditional industrial production. However, conventional
detection algorithms have stringent requirements for the angle, orientation,
and clarity of target images. In this paper, we propose an enhanced PCB defect
detection algorithm, named VR-YOLO, based on the YOLOv8 model. This algorithm
aims to improve the model's generalization performance and enhance viewpoint
robustness in practical application scenarios. We first propose a diversified
scene enhancement (DSE) method by expanding the PCB defect dataset by
incorporating diverse scenarios and segmenting samples to improve target
diversity. A novel key object focus (KOF) scheme is then presented by
considering angular loss and introducing an additional attention mechanism to
enhance fine-grained learning of small target features. Experimental results
demonstrate that our improved PCB defect detection approach achieves a mean
average precision (mAP) of 98.9% for the original test images, and 94.7% for
the test images with viewpoint shifts (horizontal and vertical shear
coefficients of $\pm 0.06$ and rotation angle of $\pm 10$ degrees), showing
significant improvements compared to the baseline YOLO model with negligible
additional computational cost.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于概念的对抗攻击框架，通过概率视角生成多样化的对抗样本，保持原始概念的同时误导分类器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对抗攻击仅针对单张图像，缺乏多样性和概念一致性，需要一种更全面的方法。

Method: 利用概率生成模型或图像集合表示概念，从中采样生成多样化的对抗样本，保持概念一致性。

Result: 生成的对抗样本更具多样性且保留原始概念，攻击效率更高。

Conclusion: 概念化对抗攻击框架在理论和实证上均优于传统方法，提供了更高效的攻击策略。

Abstract: We propose a concept-based adversarial attack framework that extends beyond
single-image perturbations by adopting a probabilistic perspective. Rather than
modifying a single image, our method operates on an entire concept --
represented by a probabilistic generative model or a set of images -- to
generate diverse adversarial examples. Preserving the concept is essential, as
it ensures that the resulting adversarial images remain identifiable as
instances of the original underlying category or identity. By sampling from
this concept-based adversarial distribution, we generate images that maintain
the original concept but vary in pose, viewpoint, or background, thereby
misleading the classifier. Mathematically, this framework remains consistent
with traditional adversarial attacks in a principled manner. Our theoretical
and empirical results demonstrate that concept-based adversarial attacks yield
more diverse adversarial examples and effectively preserve the underlying
concept, while achieving higher attack efficiency.

Motivation: 传统视觉检测系统在浑浊水下环境中难以提供可靠数据，需AI技术改进。

Method: 比较YOLOv8和YOLOv11及其变体在复杂低能见度环境中的图像分割性能。

Result: YOLOv11在整体性能上优于YOLOv8。

Conclusion: YOLOv11更适合用于低能见度水下管道的检测任务。

Abstract: Condition monitoring subsea pipelines in low-visibility underwater
environments poses significant challenges due to turbidity, light distortion,
and image degradation. Traditional visual-based inspection systems often fail
to provide reliable data for mapping, object recognition, or defect detection
in such conditions. This study explores the integration of advanced artificial
intelligence (AI) techniques to enhance image quality, detect pipeline
structures, and support autonomous fault diagnosis. This study conducts a
comparative analysis of two most robust versions of YOLOv8 and Yolov11 and
their three variants tailored for image segmentation tasks in complex and
low-visibility subsea environments. Using pipeline inspection datasets captured
beneath the seabed, it evaluates model performance in accurately delineating
target structures under challenging visual conditions. The results indicated
that YOLOv11 outperformed YOLOv8 in overall performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的框架，用于在印度全国范围内实现农场级、季节内、多作物识别，填补了农业监测中的数据空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的农场级作物类型信息对国家粮食安全、农业政策制定和经济规划至关重要，尤其是在印度这样的农业大国。现有方法在可扩展性、作物类型覆盖和季节内识别方面存在挑战。

Method: 结合Sentinel-1和Sentinel-2卫星影像与全国农场边界数据，利用深度学习模型识别12种主要作物，并开发了自动季节检测算法。

Result: 模型在冬季和季风季节的识别准确率分别为94%和75%，并能在生长季节早期（两个月内）提供可靠的作物识别。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了在印度全国范围内提供可操作农业数据的潜力，为农业监测和管理提供了新工具。

Abstract: Accurate, timely, and farm-level crop type information is paramount for
national food security, agricultural policy formulation, and economic planning,
particularly in agriculturally significant nations like India. While remote
sensing and machine learning have become vital tools for crop monitoring,
existing approaches often grapple with challenges such as limited geographical
scalability, restricted crop type coverage, the complexities of mixed-pixel and
heterogeneous landscapes, and crucially, the robust in-season identification
essential for proactive decision-making.
  We present a framework designed to address the critical data gaps for
targeted data driven decision making which generates farm-level, in-season,
multi-crop identification at national scale (India) using deep learning. Our
methodology leverages the strengths of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite
imagery, integrated with national-scale farm boundary data. The model
successfully identifies 12 major crops (which collectively account for nearly
90% of India's total cultivated area showing an agreement with national crop
census 2023-24 of 94% in winter, and 75% in monsoon season). Our approach
incorporates an automated season detection algorithm, which estimates crop
sowing and harvest periods. This allows for reliable crop identification as
early as two months into the growing season and facilitates rigorous in-season
performance evaluation. Furthermore, we have engineered a highly scalable
inference pipeline, culminating in what is, to our knowledge, the first
pan-India, in-season, farm-level crop type data product. The system's
effectiveness and scalability are demonstrated through robust validation
against national agricultural statistics, showcasing its potential to deliver
actionable, data-driven insights for transformative agricultural monitoring and
management across India.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI在重现或重新想象圣经叙事中的作用，结合模仿与创造性理论，评估AI生成图像的神学与文化维度。

Method: 使用MidJourney生成图像，通过对比Google搜索结果和古典绘画，进行视觉分析。

Result: AI能生成美学丰富的图像，但受限于训练数据的偏见，缺乏真正的创造性和神学深度。

Conclusion: AI可作为创意伙伴重新诠释圣经文本，但其在神圣艺术中的角色仍具争议。

Abstract: This study explores the intersection of artificial intelligence and the
visualization of Biblical narratives by analyzing AI-generated images of Exodus
2:5-9 (Moses found in River Nile) using MidJourney. Drawing on the classical
concepts of mimesis (imitation) and poiesis (creative generation), the authors
investigate how text-to-image (T2I) models reproduce or reimagine sacred
narratives. Through comparative visual analysis, including Google image results
and classical paintings, the research evaluates the stylistic, theological, and
cultural dimensions of AI-generated depictions. Findings show that while AI
excels in producing aesthetically rich and imaginative visuals, it also
reflects the biases and limitations of its training data. The study highlights
AI's potential to augment human imagination but questions its capacity for
genuine creativity, authorial intent, and theological depth. It concludes by
suggesting that AI can serve as a creative partner in reinterpreting biblical
texts, though its role in sacred art remains complex and contested.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的评估框架，用于测试视觉语言模型（VLMs）在空间变形推理任务中的表现，发现现有模型在此类任务中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类天生具备空间推理能力，而现有视觉语言模型是否真正理解和操作空间对象尚不明确，因此需要一种评估方法来验证其能力。

Method: 构建了一个从2D到3D的空间变形推理基准，通过数据引擎生成无限评估问题对，采用阶梯竞争形式，以变形步数为分类标准，测试模型的正向和反向推理能力。

Result: 基准测试结果显示，几乎所有模型都无法表现出合理的空间变形推理能力，即使经过针对性训练和主流推理增强方法，模型在3D空间变形推理中仍表现不佳。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型在空间变形推理任务中存在明显不足，需要进一步研究提升其能力。

Abstract: Humans naturally possess the spatial reasoning ability to form and manipulate
images and structures of objects in space. There is an increasing effort to
endow Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with similar spatial reasoning
capabilities. However, it remains unclear whether these models truly understand
and manipulate spatial objects or not. To address this question, we propose a
new evaluation framework aimed at assessing the performance of VLMs in spatial
deformation reasoning tasks. Specifically, we construct a benchmark for spatial
deformation reasoning from 2D to 3D. Leveraging our data engine, we can
generate unlimited evaluation problem pairs with infinite steps, without any
data leakage. We explore whether the model can effectively perform spatial
deformation reasoning from two directions: forward reasoning (given the
operations, find the final state) and reverse reasoning (given the final state,
determine the operations). We adopt a ladder competition format, using the
number of deformation steps as the level classification criterion, with the
goal of exploring the boundaries of the model's deformation reasoning
capabilities. Interestingly, the benchmarking results reveal that almost no
model demonstrates plausible spatial deformation reasoning abilities.
Furthermore, even after applying targeted training and mainstream reasoning
enhancement methods, the models are still unable to perform well on 3D spatial
deformation reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学数据集常存在噪声、错误标签或难以泛化的图像，且样本量小易导致过拟合，可能对医疗诊断造成风险。

Method: IMET框架结合课程学习和核心集选择，识别误分类样本以优化训练，提高模型对边缘案例的关注。

Result: 在基准医学图像分类数据集上，IMET表现出优于现有ResNet架构的鲁棒性和准确性。

Conclusion: IMET为医学图像分析提供了一种增强模型鲁棒性和准确性的有效方法。

Abstract: Deep learning models have proven to be effective on medical datasets for
accurate diagnostic predictions from images. However, medical datasets often
contain noisy, mislabeled, or poorly generalizable images, particularly for
edge cases and anomalous outcomes. Additionally, high quality datasets are
often small in sample size that can result in overfitting, where models
memorize noise rather than learn generalizable patterns. This in particular,
could pose serious risks in medical diagnostics where the risk associated with
mis-classification can impact human life. Several data-efficient training
strategies have emerged to address these constraints. In particular, coreset
selection identifies compact subsets of the most representative samples,
enabling training that approximates full-dataset performance while reducing
computational overhead. On the other hand, curriculum learning relies on
gradually increasing training difficulty and accelerating convergence. However,
developing a generalizable difficulty ranking mechanism that works across
diverse domains, datasets, and models while reducing the computational tasks
and remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce Iterative
Misclassification Error Training (IMET), a novel framework inspired by
curriculum learning and coreset selection. The IMET approach is aimed to
identify misclassified samples in order to streamline the training process,
while prioritizing the model's attention to edge case senarious and rare
outcomes. The paper evaluates IMET's performance on benchmark medical image
classification datasets against state-of-the-art ResNet architectures. The
results demonstrating IMET's potential for enhancing model robustness and
accuracy in medical image analysis are also presented in the paper.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习中深度融合与计算可扩展性之间存在矛盾，传统交叉注意力方法计算复杂度高，难以处理多模态场景。

Method: 提出Gated Recurrent Fusion (GRF)，利用Transformer Decoder层进行对称交叉注意力，并通过Gated Fusion Unit动态控制信息流。

Result: 在CMU-MOSI基准测试中表现优异，生成结构化、类别可分的表征。

Conclusion: GRF为高效、强大的多模态表征学习提供了新范式。

Abstract: Multimodal learning faces a fundamental tension between deep, fine-grained
fusion and computational scalability. While cross-attention models achieve
strong performance through exhaustive pairwise fusion, their quadratic
complexity is prohibitive for settings with many modalities. We address this
challenge with Gated Recurrent Fusion (GRF), a novel architecture that captures
the power of cross-modal attention within a linearly scalable, recurrent
pipeline. Our method processes modalities sequentially, updating an evolving
multimodal context vector at each step. The core of our approach is a fusion
block built on Transformer Decoder layers that performs symmetric
cross-attention, mutually enriching the shared context and the incoming
modality. This enriched information is then integrated via a Gated Fusion Unit
(GFU) a GRU-inspired mechanism that dynamically arbitrates information flow,
enabling the model to selectively retain or discard features. This stateful,
recurrent design scales linearly with the number of modalities, O(n), making it
ideal for high-modality environments. Experiments on the CMU-MOSI benchmark
demonstrate that GRF achieves competitive performance compared to more complex
baselines. Visualizations of the embedding space further illustrate that GRF
creates structured, class-separable representations through its progressive
fusion mechanism. Our work presents a robust and efficient paradigm for
powerful, scalable multimodal representation learning.

Motivation: 医学AI系统需要数据高效且领域感知的预训练策略，但临床数据集（如MIMIC-CXR）图像数量有限且标注稀缺，但具有丰富的内部结构（如多视图成像）。

Method: 将成对的胸部X光片（正面和侧面视图）作为自然正对，学习从稀疏补丁重建每个视图并对其潜在嵌入进行对齐。

Conclusion: 为数据稀缺但结构化的领域特定预训练提供了一种轻量级、模态无关的解决方案。

Abstract: Building generalizable medical AI systems requires pretraining strategies
that are data-efficient and domain-aware. Unlike internet-scale corpora,
clinical datasets such as MIMIC-CXR offer limited image counts and scarce
annotations, but exhibit rich internal structure through multi-view imaging. We
propose a self-supervised framework that leverages the inherent structure of
medical datasets. Specifically, we treat paired chest X-rays (i.e., frontal and
lateral views) as natural positive pairs, learning to reconstruct each view
from sparse patches while aligning their latent embeddings. Our method requires
no textual supervision and produces informative representations. Evaluated on
MIMIC-CXR, we show strong performance compared to supervised objectives and
baselines being trained without leveraging structure. This work provides a
lightweight, modality-agnostic blueprint for domain-specific pretraining where
data is structured but scarce

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion models, particularly Stable Diffusion 3.5,
has enabled the generation of highly photorealistic synthetic images that pose
significant challenges to existing detection methods. This paper presents
FreqCross, a novel multi-modal fusion network that combines spatial RGB
features, frequency domain artifacts, and radial energy distribution patterns
to achieve robust detection of AI-generated images. Our approach leverages a
three-branch architecture: (1) a ResNet-18 backbone for spatial feature
extraction, (2) a lightweight CNN for processing 2D FFT magnitude spectra, and
(3) a multi-layer perceptron for analyzing radial energy profiles. We introduce
a novel radial energy distribution analysis that captures characteristic
frequency artifacts inherent in diffusion-generated images, and fuse it with
spatial and spectral cues via simple feature concatenation followed by a
compact classification head. Extensive experiments on a dataset of 10,000
paired real (MS-COCO) and synthetic (Stable Diffusion 3.5) images demonstrate
that FreqCross achieves 97.8\% accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art
baselines by 5.2\%. The frequency analysis further reveals that synthetic

Conclusion: TG-MILNet为非侵入性脊柱侧弯检测提供了高效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Early-stage scoliosis is often difficult to detect, particularly in
adolescents, where delayed diagnosis can lead to serious health issues.
Traditional X-ray-based methods carry radiation risks and rely heavily on
clinical expertise, limiting their use in large-scale screenings. To overcome
these challenges, we propose a Text-Guided Multi-Instance Learning Network
(TG-MILNet) for non-invasive scoliosis detection using gait videos. To handle
temporal misalignment in gait sequences, we employ Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
clustering to segment videos into key gait phases. To focus on the most
relevant diagnostic features, we introduce an Inter-Bag Temporal Attention
(IBTA) mechanism that highlights critical gait phases. Recognizing the
difficulty in identifying borderline cases, we design a Boundary-Aware Model
(BAM) to improve sensitivity to subtle spinal deviations. Additionally, we
incorporate textual guidance from domain experts and large language models
(LLM) to enhance feature representation and improve model interpretability.
Experiments on the large-scale Scoliosis1K gait dataset show that TG-MILNet
achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly excelling in handling class
imbalance and accurately detecting challenging borderline cases. The code is

Method: 使用HOG和TDA提取特征，分别训练七种经典机器学习模型，并通过10折交叉验证评估。

Result: HOG和TDA在二分类任务中准确率分别为94.29%和94.18%，在多分类任务中分别为74.41%和74.69%。

Conclusion: 两种方法性能接近但捕捉不同图像特征，适用于医学图像分析并可集成到深度学习流程中。

Abstract: We present the first comparative study of two fundamentally distinct feature
extraction techniques: Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Topological
Data Analysis (TDA), for medical image classification using retinal fundus
images. HOG captures local texture and edge patterns through gradient
orientation histograms, while TDA, using cubical persistent homology, extracts
high-level topological signatures that reflect the global structure of pixel
intensities. We evaluate both methods on the large APTOS dataset for two
classification tasks: binary detection (normal versus diabetic retinopathy) and
five-class diabetic retinopathy severity grading. From each image, we extract
26244 HOG features and 800 TDA features, using them independently to train
seven classical machine learning models with 10-fold cross-validation. XGBoost
achieved the best performance in both cases: 94.29 percent accuracy (HOG) and
94.18 percent (TDA) on the binary task; 74.41 percent (HOG) and 74.69 percent
(TDA) on the multi-class task. Our results show that both methods offer
competitive performance but encode different structural aspects of the images.
This is the first work to benchmark gradient-based and topological features on
retinal imagery. The techniques are interpretable, applicable to other medical
imaging domains, and suitable for integration into deep learning pipelines.

Abstract: Performance measures such as stride length in athletics and the pace of
runners can be estimated using different tricks such as measuring the number of
steps divided by the running length or helping with markers printed on the
track. Monitoring individual performance is essential for supporting staff
coaches in establishing a proper training schedule for each athlete. The aim of
this paper is to investigate a computer vision-based approach for estimating
stride length and speed transition from video sequences and assessing video
analysis processing among athletes. Using some well-known image processing
methodologies such as probabilistic hough transform combined with a human pose
detection algorithm, we estimate the leg joint position of runners. In this
way, applying a homography transformation, we can estimate the runner stride
length. Experiments on various race videos with three different runners
demonstrated that the proposed system represents a useful tool for coaching and
training. This suggests its potential value in measuring and monitoring the
gait parameters of athletes.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Look-Back的隐式方法，指导多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在推理过程中自主重新关注视觉信息，无需显式注入视觉信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在推理后期过度依赖文本信息，忽视了视觉输入的整合，导致性能受限。

Method: 通过分析MLLM的注意力模式，发现适当引导下，MLLMs能自发重新关注视觉输入，从而提出Look-Back方法，让模型自主决定何时、何地及如何重新关注视觉信息。

Result: Look-Back显著提升了模型的推理和感知能力，在多个多模态基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: MLLMs具备内在的视觉融合推理能力，Look-Back方法通过隐式引导有效释放了这一潜力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
multimodal reasoning. However, they often excessively rely on textual
information during the later stages of inference, neglecting the crucial
integration of visual input. Current methods typically address this by
explicitly injecting visual information to guide the reasoning process. In this
work, through an analysis of MLLM attention patterns, we made an intriguing
observation: with appropriate guidance, MLLMs can spontaneously re-focus their
attention on visual inputs during the later stages of reasoning, even without
explicit visual information injection. This spontaneous shift in focus suggests
that MLLMs are intrinsically capable of performing visual fusion reasoning.
Building on this insight, we introduce Look-Back, an implicit approach designed
to guide MLLMs to ``look back" at visual information in a self-directed manner
during reasoning. Look-Back empowers the model to autonomously determine when,
where, and how to re-focus on visual inputs, eliminating the need for explicit
model-structure constraints or additional input. We demonstrate that Look-Back
significantly enhances the model's reasoning and perception capabilities, as
evidenced by extensive empirical evaluations on multiple multimodal benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统术中病理分析流程缓慢、资源密集且缺乏实时数字成像能力，亟需创新方法提升效率和准确性。

Method: 整合AI与SRH技术，通过快速生成高分辨率数字图像，实现肿瘤组织学分析、分子分类及浸润检测。

Result: 智能组织学在神经外科多个领域（如肿瘤、脊柱、儿科肿瘤等）展现出变革性潜力。

Conclusion: 智能组织学是21世纪神经外科术中肿瘤分析的革命性工作流程，未来需开发多机构数据集和AI基础模型。

Abstract: The importance of rapid and accurate histologic analysis of surgical tissue
in the operating room has been recognized for over a century. Our
standard-of-care intraoperative pathology workflow is based on light microscopy
and H\&E histology, which is slow, resource-intensive, and lacks real-time
digital imaging capabilities. Here, we present an emerging and innovative
method for intraoperative histologic analysis, called Intelligent Histology,
that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) with stimulated Raman histology
(SRH). SRH is a rapid, label-free, digital imaging method for real-time
microscopic tumor tissue analysis. SRH generates high-resolution digital images
of surgical specimens within seconds, enabling AI-driven tumor histologic
analysis, molecular classification, and tumor infiltration detection. We review
the scientific background, clinical translation, and future applications of
intelligent histology in tumor neurosurgery. We focus on the major scientific
and clinical studies that have demonstrated the transformative potential of
intelligent histology across multiple neurosurgical specialties, including
neurosurgical oncology, skull base, spine oncology, pediatric tumors, and
periperal nerve tumors. Future directions include the development of AI
foundation models through multi-institutional datasets, incorporating clinical
and radiologic data for multimodal learning, and predicting patient outcomes.
Intelligent histology represents a transformative intraoperative workflow that
can reinvent real-time tumor analysis for 21st century neurosurgery.

TL;DR: Hear-Your-Click是一个交互式视频到音频生成框架，通过点击视频中的对象生成特定声音，解决了现有方法在复杂场景中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频到音频生成方法依赖全局视频信息，难以处理复杂场景或生成特定对象的音频。

Method: 提出Object-aware Contrastive Audio-Visual Fine-tuning (OCAV)和Mask-guided Visual Encoder (MVE)，结合两种数据增强策略（RVS和MLM），并设计CAV评分指标。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在生成性能和控制精度上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Hear-Your-Click为视频到音频生成提供了更精确的控制和更好的生成效果。

Abstract: Video-to-audio (V2A) generation shows great potential in fields such as film
production. Despite significant advances, current V2A methods, which rely on
global video information, struggle with complex scenes and often fail to
generate audio tailored to specific objects or regions in the videos. To
address these limitations, we introduce Hear-Your-Click, an interactive V2A
framework that enables users to generate sounds for specific objects in the
videos by simply clicking on the frame. To achieve this, we propose
Object-aware Contrastive Audio-Visual Fine-tuning (OCAV) with a Mask-guided
Visual Encoder (MVE) to obtain object-level visual features aligned with
corresponding audio segments. Furthermore, we tailor two data augmentation
strategies: Random Video Stitching (RVS) and Mask-guided Loudness Modulation
(MLM), aimed at enhancing the model's sensitivity to the segmented objects. To
effectively measure the audio-visual correspondence, we design a new evaluation
metric, the CAV score, for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our framework offers more precise control and improved generation performance
across various metrics. Project Page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于扩散的图像生成器快速发展，区分生成图像与真实图像变得困难，亟需开发通用检测器以维护数字媒体信任。

Method: 提出LATTE方法，建模潜在嵌入在多步去噪过程中的轨迹，结合潜在-视觉特征细化模块和轻量级分类器。

Result: LATTE在GenImage和DiffusionFake等基准上表现优异，且在跨生成器和跨数据集场景中具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: LATTE展示了利用潜在嵌入轨迹检测生成图像的潜力，为数字媒体信任问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion-based image generators has made it
increasingly difficult to distinguish generated from real images. This can
erode trust in digital media, making it critical to develop generalizable
detectors for generated images. Recent methods leverage diffusion denoising
cues, but mainly focus on single-step reconstruction errors, ignoring the
inherent sequential nature of the denoising process. In this work, we propose
LATTE - Latent Trajectory Embedding - a novel approach that models the
evolution of latent embeddings across several denoising timesteps. By modeling
the trajectory of such embeddings rather than single-step errors, LATTE
captures subtle, discriminative patterns that distinguish real from generated
images. Each latent is refined by employing our latent-visual feature
refinement module and aggregated into a unified representation. Afterwards, it
is fused with the visual features and finally passed into a lightweight
classifier. Our experiments demonstrate that LATTE surpasses the baselines on
several established benchmarks, such as GenImage and DiffusionFake. Moreover,
it demonstrates strong performance in cross-generator and cross-datasets
settings, highlighting the potential of using the trajectory of latent
embeddings for generated image detection. The code is available on the

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种心理学分类法，用于分析视觉语言模型（VLMs）的幻觉行为，并设计了一个可扩展的基准测试AIpsych，揭示了模型响应模式中的心理倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于探索VLMs幻觉行为是否反映了人类心理学中的认知偏差，而不仅仅是技术限制或外部驱动因素。

Method: 方法包括设计AIpsych基准测试，分析模型架构和参数规模对行为的影响，并通过人类实验验证假设。

Result: 实验结果表明，随着模型规模增大，VLMs表现出更强的迎合倾向，但权威偏见减少，暗示能力提升但可能损害响应完整性。

Conclusion: 结论强调了从心理学角度理解VLMs幻觉行为的重要性，并呼吁将心理学原则整合到模型评估中。

Abstract: Hallucination is a long-standing problem that has been actively investigated
in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Existing research commonly attributes
hallucinations to technical limitations or sycophancy bias, where the latter
means the models tend to generate incorrect answers to align with user
expectations. However, these explanations primarily focus on technical or
externally driven factors, may have neglected the possibility that
hallucination behaviours might mirror cognitive biases observed in human
psychology. In this work, we introduce a psychological taxonomy, categorizing
VLMs' hallucination behaviours, including sycophancy, logical inconsistency,
and a newly identified VLMs behaviour: authority bias. To systematically
analyze these behaviours, we design AIpsych, a scalable benchmark that reveals
psychological tendencies in model response patterns. Leveraging this benchmark,
we investigate how variations in model architecture and parameter size
influence model behaviour when responding to strategically manipulated
questions. Our experiments reveal that as model size increases, VLMs exhibit
stronger sycophantic tendencies but reduced authority bias, suggesting
increasing competence but a potential erosion of response integrity. A human
subject study further validates our hypotheses and highlights key behavioural
differences between VLMs and human respondents. This work suggests a new
perspective for understanding hallucination in VLMs and highlights the
importance of integrating psychological principles into model evaluation.The
benchmark is available at https://github.com/lxrswdd/AIpsych.

TL;DR: 本文探索了可解释提升机（EBM）在气象学中的应用，结合特征工程开发可解释的机器学习算法，用于卫星图像中的超顶（OT）检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险应用中，可解释的机器学习算法具有优势，但尚未广泛应用于大气科学。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过数学方法提取关键特征（如云纹理），结合EBM进行分类任务，利用卫星图像数据训练模型。

Result: 开发了一个完全可解释的机器学习算法，虽然精度不及复杂方法，但表现良好。

Conclusion: 该研究为气象学中可解释机器学习算法的开发迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: An Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) is an interpretable machine learning
(ML) algorithm that has benefits in high risk applications but has not yet
found much use in atmospheric science. The overall goal of this work is
twofold: (1) explore the use of EBMs, in combination with feature engineering,
to obtain interpretable, physics-based machine learning algorithms for
meteorological applications; (2) illustrate these methods for the detection of
overshooting top (OTs) in satellite imagery.
  Specifically, we seek to simplify the process of OT detection by first using
mathematical methods to extract key features, such as cloud texture using
Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrices, followed by applying an EBM. Our EBM focuses
on the classification task of predicting OT regions, utilizing Channel 2
(visible imagery) and Channel 13 (infrared imagery) of the Advanced Baseline
Imager sensor of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite 16.
Multi-Radar/Multi-Sensor system convection flags are used as labels to train
the EBM model. Note, however, that detecting convection, while related, is
different from detecting OTs.
  Once trained, the EBM was examined and minimally altered to more closely
match strategies used by domain scientists to identify OTs. The result of our
efforts is a fully interpretable ML algorithm that was developed in a
human-machine collaboration. While the final model does not reach the accuracy
of more complex approaches, it performs well and represents a significant step
toward building fully interpretable ML algorithms for this and other
meteorological applications.

Abstract: Sudden Death Syndrome (SDS), caused by Fusarium virguliforme, poses a
significant threat to soybean production. This study presents an AI-driven web
application for early detection of SDS on soybean leaves using hyperspectral
imaging, enabling diagnosis prior to visible symptom onset. Leaf samples from
healthy and inoculated plants were scanned using a portable hyperspectral
imaging system (398-1011 nm), and a Genetic Algorithm was employed to select
five informative wavelengths (505.4, 563.7, 712.2, 812.9, and 908.4 nm)
critical for discriminating infection status. These selected bands were fed
into a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract
spatial-spectral features, which were subsequently classified using ten
classical machine learning models. Ensemble classifiers (Random Forest,
AdaBoost), Linear SVM, and Neural Net achieved the highest accuracy (>98%) and
minimal error across all folds, as confirmed by confusion matrices and
cross-validation metrics. Poor performance by Gaussian Process and QDA
highlighted their unsuitability for this dataset. The trained models were
deployed within a web application that enables users to upload hyperspectral
leaf images, visualize spectral profiles, and receive real-time classification
results. This system supports rapid and accessible plant disease diagnostics,
contributing to precision agriculture practices. Future work will expand the
training dataset to encompass diverse genotypes, field conditions, and disease
stages, and will extend the system for multiclass disease classification and
broader crop applicability.

Conclusion: 该研究为农业领域提供了高效病害检测工具，有望提升作物产量和粮食安全。

Abstract: Like many countries, Nigeria is naturally endowed with fertile agricultural
soil that supports large-scale tomato production. However, the prevalence of
disease causing pathogens poses a significant threat to tomato health, often
leading to reduced yields and, in severe cases, the extinction of certain
species. These diseases jeopardise both the quality and quantity of tomato
harvests, contributing to food insecurity. Fortunately, tomato diseases can
often be visually identified through distinct forms, appearances, or textures,
typically first visible on leaves and fruits. This study presents an enhanced
Capsule-YOLO network architecture designed to automatically segment overlapping
and occluded tomato leaf images from complex backgrounds using the YOLO
framework. It identifies disease symptoms with impressive performance metrics:
99.31% accuracy, 98.78% recall, and 99.09% precision, and a 98.93% F1-score
representing improvements of 2.91%, 1.84%, 5.64%, and 4.12% over existing
state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, a user-friendly interface was developed
to allow farmers and users to upload images of affected tomato plants and
detect early disease symptoms. The system also provides recommendations for
appropriate diagnosis and treatment. The effectiveness of this approach
promises significant benefits for the agricultural sector by enhancing crop
yields and strengthening food security.

Motivation: 研究如何在简化条件下（正交投影和相机固定）高效计算刚体的旋转，同时实现场景分割。

Method: 通过跟踪图像中的一个特征点，解析计算刚体的瞬时旋转速率，适用于任意形状的物体。

Result: 仿真和真实视频数据验证了方法的有效性，并能通过旋转速率差异实现场景分割。

Conclusion: 该方法在简化条件下高效且通用，适用于并行处理和场景分割。

Abstract: We demonstrate that, under orthographic projection and with a camera fixated
on a point located on a rigid body, the rotation of that body can be
analytically obtained by tracking only one other feature in the image. With
some exceptions, any tracked point, regardless of its location on the body,
yields the same value of the instantaneous rotation rate.
  The proposed method is independent of the shape of the 3D object and does not
require a priori knowledge about the scene. This algorithm is suited for
parallel processing and can achieve segmentation of the scene by distinguishing
points that do not belong to the same rigid body, simply because they do not
produce the same value of the rotation. This paper presents an analytical
derivation, simulation results, and results from real video data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SICL的损失函数，通过抑制主体特异性线索来提升人类活动识别的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数据标注成本高，自监督学习方法（如对比学习）在人类活动识别（HAR）中具有吸引力。然而，主体间的域偏移导致模型难以泛化到新主体。

Method: 提出Subject-Invariant Contrastive Learning (SICL)，通过重新加权来自同一主体的负样本对，抑制主体特异性信息，突出活动特异性特征。

Result: 在三个公开基准测试（UTD-MHAD、MMAct、DARai）上，SICL比传统对比学习方法性能提升高达11%。

Conclusion: SICL是一种简单有效的损失函数，适用于多种自监督方法、多模态场景和监督学习框架，显著提升了HAR的泛化能力。

Abstract: The high cost of annotating data makes self-supervised approaches, such as
contrastive learning methods, appealing for Human Activity Recognition (HAR).
Effective contrastive learning relies on selecting informative positive and
negative samples. However, HAR sensor signals are subject to significant domain
shifts caused by subject variability. These domain shifts hinder model
generalization to unseen subjects by embedding subject-specific variations
rather than activity-specific features. As a result, human activity recognition
models trained with contrastive learning often struggle to generalize to new
subjects. We introduce Subject-Invariant Contrastive Learning (SICL), a simple
yet effective loss function to improve generalization in human activity
recognition. SICL re-weights negative pairs drawn from the same subject to
suppress subject-specific cues and emphasize activity-specific information. We
evaluate our loss function on three public benchmarks: UTD-MHAD, MMAct, and
DARai. We show that SICL improves performance by up to 11% over traditional
contrastive learning methods. Additionally, we demonstrate the adaptability of
our loss function across various settings, including multiple self-supervised
methods, multimodal scenarios, and supervised learning frameworks.

Result: 模型轻量且泛化能力强，支持直观的图像编辑和风格化，适用于多种图像创作流程。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了多对象场景合成的真实性和语义丰富性，扩展了应用范围。

Abstract: Existing generative approaches for guided image synthesis of multi-object
scenes typically rely on 2D controls in the image or text space. As a result,
these methods struggle to maintain and respect consistent three-dimensional
geometric structure, underlying the scene. In this paper, we propose a novel
conditioning approach, training method and adapter network that can be plugged
into pretrained text-to-image diffusion models. Our approach provides a way to
endow such models with 3D-awareness, while leveraging their rich prior
knowledge. Our method supports camera control, conditioning on explicit 3D
geometries and, for the first time, accounts for the entire context of a scene,
i.e., both on and off-screen items, to synthesize plausible and semantically
rich images. Despite its multi-modal nature, our model is lightweight, requires
a reasonable number of data for supervised learning and shows remarkable
generalization power. We also introduce methods for intuitive and consistent
image editing and restyling, e.g., by positioning, rotating or resizing
individual objects in a scene. Our method integrates well within various image
creation workflows and enables a richer set of applications compared to
previous approaches.

Result: 实验证实部分视觉编码器对性能贡献极小或负面，揭示了显著的冗余现象。

Conclusion: 当前多编码器设计存在低效问题，提出的指标可作为诊断工具，帮助设计更高效的多模态架构。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly adopt multiple vision
encoders to capture diverse visual information, ranging from coarse semantics
to fine grained details. While this approach is intended to enhance visual
understanding capability, we observe that the performance gains from adding
encoders often diminish and can even lead to performance degradation, a
phenomenon we term encoder redundancy. This paper presents a systematic
investigation into this issue. Through comprehensive ablation studies on state
of the art multi encoder MLLMs, we empirically demonstrate that significant
redundancy exists. To quantify each encoder's unique contribution, we propose a
principled metric: the Conditional Utilization Rate (CUR). Building on CUR, we
introduce the Information Gap (IG) to capture the overall disparity in encoder
utility within a model.Our experiments reveal that certain vision encoders
contribute little, or even negatively, to overall performance, confirming
substantial redundancy. Our experiments reveal that certain vision encoders
contribute minimally, or even negatively, to the model's performance,
confirming the prevalence of redundancy. These findings highlight critical
inefficiencies in current multi encoder designs and establish that our proposed
metrics can serve as valuable diagnostic tools for developing more efficient
and effective multimodal architectures.

Motivation: 双频PolSAR图像的协同分类存在区域一致性对信息学习的影响以及双频数据合理利用的挑战。

Method: 设计了基于统计的动态样本校正模块（SDSR）和双频门控选择蒸馏模块（DGSD），分别用于优化样本纯度和实现双频数据的互补学习。

Result: 在四个实测双频PolSAR数据集上的实验表明，SKDNet-SSR优于其他相关方法。

Conclusion: SKDNet-SSR有效解决了双频PolSAR分类中的关键问题，提升了分类性能。

Abstract: The collaborative classification of dual-frequency PolSAR images is a
meaningful but also challenging research. The effect of regional consistency on
classification information learning and the rational use of dual-frequency data
are two main difficulties for dual-frequency collaborative classification. To
tackle these problems, a selected knowledge distillation network with
statistical-based sample rectification (SKDNet-SSR) is proposed in this
article. First, in addition to applying CNN and ViT as local and global feature
extractors, a statistical-based dynamic sample rectification (SDSR) module is
designed to avoid the impact of poor regional consistency on spatial
information learning process. Specifically, based on the fact that the PolSAR
covariance matrix conforms to the complex Wishart distribution, SDSR first
dynamically evaluates the sample purity, and then performs pixel selection and
pixel generation to remove noisy pixels, thereby avoiding the feature
interaction between informative pixels and noisy pixels and improving the
classification feature extraction process. Next, a dual-frequency gate-selected
distillation (DGSD) module is constructed to emphasize the advantages of
different frequency bands and perform complementary learning on dual-frequency
data. It uses the dominant single-frequency branch on each sample as teacher
model to train the dual-frequency student model, enabling the student model to
learn the optimal results and realizing complementary utilization of
dual-frequency data on different terrain objects. Comprehensive experiments on
four measured dual-frequency PolSAR data demonstrate that the proposed
SKDNet-SSR outperforms other related methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像（T2I）基准测试使用固定提示词，可能低估模型真实生成能力并引入偏见，导致某些模型被不公平对待。

Method: 基于ConceptMix，引入多模态优化管道，利用视觉语言模型反馈系统优化提示词，提升生成性能。

Result: 优化后的提示词显著改善组合生成性能，揭示模型隐藏能力，并发现某些视觉概念（如空间关系和形状）更受益于优化。

Conclusion: 固定基准测试可能低估模型真实能力，而ConceptMix++提供了更准确的评估方法，为未来研究提供新视角。

Abstract: Current text-to-image (T2I) benchmarks evaluate models on rigid prompts,
potentially underestimating true generative capabilities due to prompt
sensitivity and creating biases that favor certain models while disadvantaging
others. We introduce ConceptMix++, a framework that disentangles prompt
phrasing from visual generation capabilities by applying iterative prompt
optimization. Building on ConceptMix, our approach incorporates a multimodal
optimization pipeline that leverages vision-language model feedback to refine
prompts systematically. Through extensive experiments across multiple diffusion
models, we show that optimized prompts significantly improve compositional
generation performance, revealing previously hidden model capabilities and
enabling fairer comparisons across T2I models. Our analysis reveals that
certain visual concepts -- such as spatial relationships and shapes -- benefit
more from optimization than others, suggesting that existing benchmarks
systematically underestimate model performance in these categories.
Additionally, we find strong cross-model transferability of optimized prompts,
indicating shared preferences for effective prompt phrasing across models.
These findings demonstrate that rigid benchmarking approaches may significantly
underrepresent true model capabilities, while our framework provides more
accurate assessment and insights for future development.

Method: 提出基于掩码的元素剪枝方法和一致性引导的历史压缩模块。

Result: SimpAgent减少了27%的FLOPs，并在多样化的GUI导航任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: SimpAgent通过简化上下文建模，显著提升了GUI代理的效率和有效性。

Abstract: The research focus of GUI agents is shifting from text-dependent to
pure-vision-based approaches, which, though promising, prioritize comprehensive
pre-training data collection while neglecting contextual modeling challenges.
We probe the characteristics of element and history contextual modeling in GUI
agent and summarize: 1) the high-density and loose-relation of element context
highlight the existence of many unrelated elements and their negative
influence; 2) the high redundancy of history context reveals the inefficient
history modeling in current GUI agents. In this work, we propose a
context-aware simplification framework for building an efficient and effective
GUI Agent, termed SimpAgent. To mitigate potential interference from numerous
unrelated elements, we introduce a masking-based element pruning method that
circumvents the intractable relation modeling through an efficient masking
mechanism. To reduce the redundancy in historical information, we devise a
consistency-guided history compression module, which enhances implicit
LLM-based compression through innovative explicit guidance, achieving an
optimal balance between performance and efficiency. With the above components,
SimpAgent reduces 27% FLOPs and achieves superior GUI navigation performances.
Comprehensive navigation experiments across diverse web and mobile environments
demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of our agent.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需微调的视觉Transformer架构（{\pname}），通过模拟遗忘过程直接实现选择性遗忘，避免了性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习遗忘方法依赖微调，成本高且可能导致性能下降，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 在训练过程中随机分离类/子类为遗忘集和保留集，优化模型使其无法预测遗忘集，通过撤销密钥实现即时遗忘。

Result: 在多个数据集和架构上验证了{\pname}优于现有方法，避免了性能下降。

Conclusion: {\pname}提供了一种高效、无需微调的机器学习遗忘解决方案。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MUL) refers to the problem of making a pre-trained model
selectively forget some training instances or class(es) while retaining
performance on the remaining dataset. Existing MUL research involves
fine-tuning using a forget and/or retain set, making it expensive and/or
impractical, and often causing performance degradation in the unlearned model.
We introduce {\pname}, an unlearning-aware vision transformer-based
architecture that can directly perform unlearning for future unlearning
requests without any fine-tuning over the requested set. The proposed model is
trained by simulating unlearning during the training process itself. It
involves randomly separating class(es)/sub-class(es) present in each mini-batch
into two disjoint sets: a proxy forget-set and a retain-set, and the model is
optimized so that it is unable to predict the forget-set. Forgetting is
achieved by withdrawing keys, making unlearning on-the-fly and avoiding
performance degradation. The model is trained jointly with learnable keys and
original weights, ensuring withholding a key irreversibly erases information,
validated by membership inference attack scores. Extensive experiments on
various datasets, architectures, and resolutions confirm {\pname}'s superiority
over both fine-tuning-free and fine-tuning-based methods.

Motivation: 传统基于文本（如SMILES/SELFIES）的分子表示方法存在模糊性和结构信息不足的问题，MolVision通过视觉语言模型整合图像和文本信息以改进预测。

Method: 提出MolVision方法，利用VLMs融合分子结构图像和文本描述，并在10个数据集上评估9种VLMs的零样本、少样本和微调性能，采用LoRA等高效微调策略。

Result: 视觉信息单独使用效果有限，但多模态融合显著提升泛化能力；结合LoRA的视觉编码器进一步优化性能。

Conclusion: MolVision通过多模态融合和高效微调策略，显著提升了分子属性预测的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is a fundamental task in computational
chemistry with critical applications in drug discovery and materials science.
While recent works have explored Large Language Models (LLMs) for this task,
they primarily rely on textual molecular representations such as
SMILES/SELFIES, which can be ambiguous and structurally less informative. In
this work, we introduce MolVision, a novel approach that leverages
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by integrating both molecular structure as images
and textual descriptions to enhance property prediction. We construct a
benchmark spanning ten diverse datasets, covering classification, regression
and description tasks. Evaluating nine different VLMs in zero-shot, few-shot,
and fine-tuned settings, we find that visual information improves prediction
performance, particularly when combined with efficient fine-tuning strategies
such as LoRA. Our results reveal that while visual information alone is
insufficient, multimodal fusion significantly enhances generalization across
molecular properties. Adaptation of vision encoder for molecular images in
conjunction with LoRA further improves the performance. The code and data is

Conclusion: 该方法在无需姿态标注的情况下，实现了对未见类别的泛化能力。

Abstract: One practical approach to infer 3D scene structure from a single image is to
retrieve a closely matching 3D model from a database and align it with the
object in the image. Existing methods rely on supervised training with images
and pose annotations, which limits them to a narrow set of object categories.
To address this, we propose a weakly supervised 9-DoF alignment method for
inexact 3D models that requires no pose annotations and generalizes to unseen
categories. Our approach derives a novel feature space based on foundation
features that ensure multi-view consistency and overcome symmetry ambiguities
inherent in foundation features using a self-supervised triplet loss.
Additionally, we introduce a texture-invariant pose refinement technique that
performs dense alignment in normalized object coordinates, estimated through
the enhanced feature space. We conduct extensive evaluations on the real-world
ScanNet25k dataset, where our method outperforms SOTA weakly supervised
baselines by +4.3% mean alignment accuracy and is the only weakly supervised
approach to surpass the supervised ROCA by +2.7%. To assess generalization, we
introduce SUN2CAD, a real-world test set with 20 novel object categories, where
our method achieves SOTA results without prior training on them.

Abstract: Gastrointestinal malignancies constitute a leading cause of cancer-related
mortality worldwide, with advanced-stage prognosis remaining particularly
dismal. Originating as a groundbreaking technique for early gastric cancer
treatment, Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection has evolved into a versatile
intervention for diverse gastrointestinal lesions. While computer-assisted
systems significantly enhance procedural precision and safety in ESD, their
clinical adoption faces a critical bottleneck: reliable surgical phase
recognition within complex endoscopic workflows. Current state-of-the-art
approaches predominantly rely on multi-stage refinement architectures that
iteratively optimize temporal predictions. In this paper, we present Clinical
Prior Knowledge-Constrained Diffusion (CPKD), a novel generative framework that
reimagines phase recognition through denoising diffusion principles while
preserving the core iterative refinement philosophy. This architecture
progressively reconstructs phase sequences starting from random noise and
conditioned on visual-temporal features. To better capture three
domain-specific characteristics, including positional priors, boundary
ambiguity, and relation dependency, we design a conditional masking strategy.
Furthermore, we incorporate clinical prior knowledge into the model training to
improve its ability to correct phase logical errors. Comprehensive evaluations
on ESD820, Cholec80, and external multi-center demonstrate that our proposed
CPKD achieves superior or comparable performance to state-of-the-art
approaches, validating the effectiveness of diffusion-based generative
paradigms for surgical phase recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督语义分割方法在基准数据集上表现良好，但未充分探索利用大量未标记OOD图像的潜力。现实场景中，这些图像分布可能与目标数据集不同，导致伪标签不准确。

Method: 提出SemiOVS框架，结合开放词汇分割模型（OVS）为OOD图像生成伪标签，优化半监督学习。

Result: 在Pascal VOC和Context数据集上，SemiOVS比PrevMatch和SemiVL分别提升3.5和3.0 mIoU，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: SemiOVS能有效利用未标记OOD图像，为未来研究和实际应用提供启发。

Abstract: In semi-supervised semantic segmentation, existing studies have shown
promising results in academic settings with controlled splits of benchmark
datasets. However, the potential benefits of leveraging significantly larger
sets of unlabeled images remain unexplored. In real-world scenarios, abundant
unlabeled images are often available from online sources (web-scraped images)
or large-scale datasets. However, these images may have different distributions
from those of the target dataset, a situation known as out-of-distribution
(OOD). Using these images as unlabeled data in semi-supervised learning can
lead to inaccurate pseudo-labels, potentially misguiding network training. In
this paper, we propose a new semi-supervised semantic segmentation framework
with an open-vocabulary segmentation model (SemiOVS) to effectively utilize
unlabeled OOD images. Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC and Context datasets
demonstrate two key findings: (1) using additional unlabeled images improves
the performance of semi-supervised learners in scenarios with few labels, and
(2) using the open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) model to pseudo-label OOD
images leads to substantial performance gains. In particular, SemiOVS
outperforms existing PrevMatch and SemiVL methods by +3.5 and +3.0 mIoU,
respectively, on Pascal VOC with a 92-label setting, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. These findings demonstrate that our approach effectively utilizes
abundant unlabeled OOD images for semantic segmentation tasks. We hope this
work can inspire future research and real-world applications. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单模态领域泛化方法在多模态场景下效果不佳，因未考虑模态间一致性和目标域不可见性。

Result: 在EPIC-Kitchens和Human-Animal-Cartoon等数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了多模态领域泛化能力，优于现有技术。

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) aims to enhance model robustness in unseen or
distributionally shifted target domains through training exclusively on source
domains. Although existing DG techniques, such as data manipulation, learning
strategies, and representation learning, have shown significant progress, they
predominantly address single-modal data. With the emergence of numerous
multi-modal datasets and increasing demand for multi-modal tasks, a key
challenge in Multi-modal Domain Generalization (MMDG) has emerged: enabling
models trained on multi-modal sources to generalize to unseen target
distributions within the same modality set. Due to the inherent differences
between modalities, directly transferring methods from single-modal DG to MMDG
typically yields sub-optimal results. These methods often exhibit randomness
during generalization due to the invisibility of target domains and fail to
consider inter-modal consistency. Applying these methods independently to each
modality in the MMDG setting before combining them can lead to divergent
generalization directions across different modalities, resulting in degraded
generalization capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
approach that leverages Unified Representations to map different paired
modalities together, effectively adapting DG methods to MMDG by enabling
synchronized multi-modal improvements within the unified space. Additionally,
we introduce a supervised disentanglement framework that separates
modal-general and modal-specific information, further enhancing the alignment
of unified representations. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets,
including EPIC-Kitchens and Human-Animal-Cartoon, demonstrate the effectiveness
and superiority of our method in enhancing multi-modal domain generalization.

Motivation: 多相机系统在自动驾驶和机器人环境感知中日益重要，但传统全局SfM系统因优化框架问题缺乏鲁棒性。

Method: 采用分层策略进行旋转平均，结合相机间和相机到点的约束进行平移平均，并使用凸距离和无偏非双线性角度目标函数优化。

Result: 在大规模数据集上，系统匹配或超越增量SfM的精度，同时显著提高效率，优于现有全局SfM方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为多相机SfM应用提供了鲁棒的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Multi-camera systems are increasingly vital in the environmental perception
of autonomous vehicles and robotics. Their physical configuration offers
inherent fixed relative pose constraints that benefit Structure-from-Motion
(SfM). However, traditional global SfM systems struggle with robustness due to
their optimization framework. We propose a novel global motion averaging
framework for multi-camera systems, featuring two core components: a decoupled
rotation averaging module and a hybrid translation averaging module. Our
rotation averaging employs a hierarchical strategy by first estimating relative
rotations within rigid camera units and then computing global rigid unit
rotations. To enhance the robustness of translation averaging, we incorporate
both camera-to-camera and camera-to-point constraints to initialize camera
positions and 3D points with a convex distance-based objective function and
refine them with an unbiased non-bilinear angle-based objective function.
Experiments on large-scale datasets show that our system matches or exceeds
incremental SfM accuracy while significantly improving efficiency. Our
framework outperforms existing global SfM methods, establishing itself as a
robust solution for real-world multi-camera SfM applications. The code is
available at https://github.com/3dv-casia/MGSfM/.

Method: 提出一个流程：利用AWS作为输入，通过LLM生成文本提示，再使用扩散模型生成图像。评估基于Reddit数据的49种作者风格。

Conclusion: 该方法为视觉作者风格个性化提供了端到端解决方案，并初步验证了其有效性，为创意辅助和跨模态理解开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Translating nuanced, textually-defined authorial writing styles into
compelling visual representations presents a novel challenge in generative AI.
This paper introduces a pipeline that leverages Author Writing Sheets (AWS) -
structured summaries of an author's literary characteristics - as input to a
Large Language Model (LLM, Claude 3.7 Sonnet). The LLM interprets the AWS to
generate three distinct, descriptive text-to-image prompts, which are then
rendered by a diffusion model (Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium). We evaluated our
approach using 49 author styles from Reddit data, with human evaluators
assessing the stylistic match and visual distinctiveness of the generated
images. Results indicate a good perceived alignment between the generated
visuals and the textual authorial profiles (mean style match: $4.08/5$), with
images rated as moderately distinctive. Qualitative analysis further
highlighted the pipeline's ability to capture mood and atmosphere, while also
identifying challenges in representing highly abstract narrative elements. This
work contributes a novel end-to-end methodology for visual authorial style
personalization and provides an initial empirical validation, opening avenues
for applications in creative assistance and cross-modal understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中隐私问题限制了对敏感数据的访问，SFUDA无需目标域标签数据即可进行域适应，但存在原型样本质量低和伪标签分配错误的问题。

Method: 方法包括三个阶段：1) 可靠样本记忆模块（RSM）提升原型质量；2) 多视图对比学习（MVCL）增强伪标签质量；3) 噪声标签过滤技术进一步优化伪标签。

Result: 在VisDA 2017、Office-Home和Office-31数据集上，分类准确率分别比次优方法和13种先进方法平均提高了约2%和6%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了SFUDA中的关键挑战，显著提升了域适应性能。

Abstract: Domain adaptation has become a widely adopted approach in machine learning
due to the high costs associated with labeling data. It is typically applied
when access to a labeled source domain is available. However, in real-world
scenarios, privacy concerns often restrict access to sensitive information,
such as fingerprints, bank account details, and facial images. A promising
solution to this issue is Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA),
which enables domain adaptation without requiring access to labeled target
domain data. Recent research demonstrates that SFUDA can effectively address
domain discrepancies; however, two key challenges remain: (1) the low quality
of prototype samples, and (2) the incorrect assignment of pseudo-labels. To
tackle these challenges, we propose a method consisting of three main phases.
In the first phase, we introduce a Reliable Sample Memory (RSM) module to
improve the quality of prototypes by selecting more representative samples. In
the second phase, we employ a Multi-View Contrastive Learning (MVCL) approach
to enhance pseudo-label quality by leveraging multiple data augmentations. In
the final phase, we apply a noisy label filtering technique to further refine
the pseudo-labels. Our experiments on three benchmark datasets - VisDA 2017,
Office-Home, and Office-31 - demonstrate that our method achieves approximately
2 percent and 6 percent improvements in classification accuracy over the
second-best method and the average of 13 well-known state-of-the-art
approaches, respectively.

Conclusion: MIMO为商业设计任务提供了一种高效、自动化的解决方案，能够满足复杂的设计需求。

Abstract: Recent generative models such as GPT-4o have shown strong capabilities in
producing high-quality images with accurate text rendering. However, commercial
design tasks like advertising banners demand more than visual fidelity -- they
require structured layouts, precise typography, consistent branding, and more.
In this paper, we introduce MIMO (Mirror In-the-Model), an agentic refinement
framework for automatic ad banner generation. MIMO combines a hierarchical
multi-modal agent system (MIMO-Core) with a coordination loop (MIMO-Loop) that
explores multiple stylistic directions and iteratively improves design quality.
Requiring only a simple natural language based prompt and logo image as input,
MIMO automatically detects and corrects multiple types of errors during
generation. Experiments show that MIMO significantly outperforms existing
diffusion and LLM-based baselines in real-world banner design scenarios.

Abstract: To alleviate the reliance of deep neural networks on large-scale datasets,
dataset distillation aims to generate compact, high-quality synthetic datasets
that can achieve comparable performance to the original dataset. The
integration of generative models has significantly advanced this field.
However, existing approaches primarily focus on aligning the distilled dataset
with the original one, often overlooking task-specific information that can be
critical for optimal downstream performance. In this paper, focusing on the
downstream task of classification, we propose a task-specific sampling strategy
for generative dataset distillation that incorporates the concept of difficulty
to consider the requirements of the target task better. The final dataset is
sampled from a larger image pool with a sampling distribution obtained by
matching the difficulty distribution of the original dataset. A logarithmic
transformation is applied as a pre-processing step to correct for
distributional bias. The results of extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method and suggest its potential for enhancing performance
on other downstream tasks.

Abstract: Detecting deepfakes involving face-swaps presents a significant challenge,
particularly in real-world scenarios where anyone can perform face-swapping
with freely available tools and apps without any technical knowledge. Existing
deepfake detection methods rely on facial landmarks or inconsistencies in
pixel-level features and often struggle with face-swap deepfakes, where the
source face is seamlessly blended into the target image or video. The
prevalence of face-swap is evident in everyday life, where it is used to spread
false information, damage reputations, manipulate political opinions, create
non-consensual intimate deepfakes (NCID), and exploit children by enabling the
creation of child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Even prominent public figures
are not immune to its impact, with numerous deepfakes of them circulating
widely across social media platforms. Another challenge faced by deepfake
detection methods is the creation of datasets that encompass a wide range of
variations, as training models require substantial amounts of data. This raises
privacy concerns, particularly regarding the processing and storage of personal
facial data, which could lead to unauthorized access or misuse. Our key idea is
to identify these style discrepancies to detect face-swapped images effectively
without accessing the real facial image. We perform comprehensive evaluations
using multiple datasets and face-swapping methods, which showcases the
effectiveness of SafeVision in detecting face-swap deepfakes across diverse
scenarios. SafeVision offers a reliable and scalable solution for detecting
face-swaps in a privacy preserving manner, making it particularly effective in
challenging real-world applications. To the best of our knowledge, SafeVision
is the first deepfake detection using style features while providing inherent
privacy protection.

Motivation: 现有CSLR方法难以处理多样样本，且动态卷积主要关注空间建模，忽略了时间动态和上下文依赖。

Conclusion: DESign通过DCAC和SR-CTC有效提升了CSLR的泛化能力和识别精度，且SR-CTC无额外推理开销。

Abstract: Current continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) methods struggle with
handling diverse samples. Although dynamic convolutions are ideal for this
task, they mainly focus on spatial modeling and fail to capture the temporal
dynamics and contextual dependencies. To address this, we propose DESign, a
novel framework that incorporates Dynamic Context-Aware Convolution (DCAC) and
Subnet Regularization Connectionist Temporal Classification (SR-CTC). DCAC
dynamically captures the inter-frame motion cues that constitute signs and
uniquely adapts convolutional weights in a fine-grained manner based on
contextual information, enabling the model to better generalize across diverse
signing behaviors and boost recognition accuracy. Furthermore, we observe that
existing methods still rely on only a limited number of frames for parameter
updates during training, indicating that CTC learning overfits to a dominant
path. To address this, SR-CTC regularizes training by applying supervision to
subnetworks, encouraging the model to explore diverse CTC alignment paths and
effectively preventing overfitting. A classifier-sharing strategy in SR-CTC
further strengthens multi-scale consistency. Notably, SR-CTC introduces no
inference overhead and can be seamlessly integrated into existing CSLR models
to boost performance. Extensive ablations and visualizations further validate
the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Results on mainstream CSLR datasets
(i.e., PHOENIX14, PHOENIX14-T, CSL-Daily) demonstrate that DESign achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection aims to localize semantic changes between
images of the same location captured at different times. In the past few years,
newer methods have attributed enhanced performance to the additions of new and
complex components to existing architectures. Most fail to measure the
performance contribution of fundamental design choices such as backbone
selection, pre-training strategies, and training configurations. We claim that
such fundamental design choices often improve performance even more
significantly than the addition of new architectural components. Due to that,
we systematically revisit the design space of change detection models and
analyse the full potential of a well-optimised baseline. We identify a set of
fundamental design choices that benefit both new and existing architectures.
Leveraging this insight, we demonstrate that when carefully designed, even an
architecturally simple model can match or surpass state-of-the-art performance
on six challenging change detection datasets. Our best practices generalise
beyond our architecture and also offer performance improvements when applied to
related methods, indicating that the space of fundamental design choices has
been underexplored. Our guidelines and architecture provide a strong foundation
for future methods, emphasizing that optimizing core components is just as
important as architectural novelty in advancing change detection performance.

### [60] [MRC-DETR: An Adaptive Multi-Residual Coupled Transformer for Bare Board PCB Defect Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03386)

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MRC-DETR的新型高效检测框架，用于PCB缺陷检测，通过改进特征表示、减少计算冗余和提供高质量数据集来解决现有方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PCB缺陷检测方法存在特征表示有限、计算冗余和训练数据不足的问题，无法满足工业对准确性和效率的需求。

Method: 设计了多残差方向耦合块（MRDCB）增强特征表示，引入自适应筛选金字塔网络（ASPN）减少计算冗余，并构建了高质量数据集。

Result: 提出的框架显著提高了检测效率和准确性，数据集填补了现有资源的空白。

Conclusion: MRC-DETR为PCB缺陷检测提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案，数据集为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: In modern electronic manufacturing, defect detection on Printed Circuit
Boards (PCBs) plays a critical role in ensuring product yield and maintaining
the reliability of downstream assembly processes. However, existing methods
often suffer from limited feature representation, computational redundancy, and
insufficient availability of high-quality training data -- challenges that
hinder their ability to meet industrial demands for both accuracy and
efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose MRC-DETR, a novel and
efficient detection framework tailored for bare PCB defect inspection, built
upon the foundation of RT-DETR. Firstly, to enhance feature representation
capability, we design a Multi-Residual Directional Coupled Block (MRDCB). This
module improves channel-wise feature interaction through a multi-residual
structure. Moreover, a cross-spatial learning strategy is integrated to capture
fine-grained pixel-level relationships, further enriching the representational
power of the extracted features. Secondly, to reduce computational redundancy
caused by inefficient cross-layer information fusion, we introduce an Adaptive
Screening Pyramid Network (ASPN). This component dynamically filters and
aggregates salient low-level features, selectively fusing them with high-level
semantic features. By focusing on informative regions and suppressing redundant
computations, ASPN significantly improves both efficiency and detection
accuracy. Finally, to tackle the issue of insufficient training data,
particularly in the context of bare PCBs, we construct a new, high-quality
dataset that fills a critical gap in current public resources. Our dataset not
only supports the training and evaluation of our proposed framework but also
serves as a valuable benchmark for future research in this domain.

Result: 在三个基准数据集上表现优异，验证了MTID在动作规划任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: MTID通过增强视觉监督和动作生成空间限制，显著提升了动作序列的连贯性和任务对齐性。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of procedure planning in
instructional videos, aiming to generate coherent and task-aligned action
sequences from start and end visual observations. Previous work has mainly
relied on text-level supervision to bridge the gap between observed states and
unobserved actions, but it struggles with capturing intricate temporal
relationships among actions. Building on these efforts, we propose the Masked
Temporal Interpolation Diffusion (MTID) model that introduces a latent space
temporal interpolation module within the diffusion model. This module leverages
a learnable interpolation matrix to generate intermediate latent features,
thereby augmenting visual supervision with richer mid-state details. By
integrating this enriched supervision into the model, we enable end-to-end
training tailored to task-specific requirements, significantly enhancing the
model's capacity to predict temporally coherent action sequences. Additionally,
we introduce an action-aware mask projection mechanism to restrict the action
generation space, combined with a task-adaptive masked proximity loss to
prioritize more accurate reasoning results close to the given start and end
states over those in intermediate steps. Simultaneously, it filters out
task-irrelevant action predictions, leading to contextually aware action
sequences. Experimental results across three widely used benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our MTID achieves promising action planning performance on
most metrics. The code is available at https://github.com/WiserZhou/MTID.

Abstract: Estimating normals for noisy point clouds is a persistent challenge in 3D
geometry processing, particularly for end-to-end oriented normal estimation.
Existing methods generally address relatively clean data and rely on supervised
priors to fit local surfaces within specific neighborhoods. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach for learning normals from noisy point clouds through
local gradient-aware surface filtering. Our method projects noisy points onto
the underlying surface by utilizing normals and distances derived from an
implicit function constrained by local gradients. We start by introducing a
distance measurement operator for global surface fitting on noisy data, which
integrates projected distances along normals. Following this, we develop an
implicit field-based filtering approach for surface point construction, adding
projection constraints on these points during filtering. To address issues of
over-smoothing and gradient degradation, we further incorporate local gradient
consistency constraints, as well as local gradient orientation and aggregation.
Comprehensive experiments on normal estimation, surface reconstruction, and
point cloud denoising demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our
method. The source code and trained models are available at

Result: Pose-Star实现了解剖感知、姿态鲁棒的时尚图像编辑，填补了可控基准与开放世界需求之间的差距。

Conclusion: 该工作为工业级时尚图像编辑奠定了基础，开创了基于解剖感知和姿态鲁棒的编辑方法。

Abstract: To advance real-world fashion image editing, we analyze existing two-stage
pipelines(mask generation followed by diffusion-based editing)which overly
prioritize generator optimization while neglecting mask controllability. This
results in two critical limitations: I) poor user-defined flexibility
(coarse-grained human masks restrict edits to predefined regions like upper
torso; fine-grained clothes masks preserve poses but forbid style/length
customization). II) weak pose robustness (mask generators fail due to
articulated poses and miss rare regions like waist, while human parsers remain
limited by predefined categories). To address these gaps, we propose Pose-Star,
a framework that dynamically recomposes body structures (e.g., neck, chest,
etc.) into anatomy-aware masks (e.g., chest-length) for user-defined edits. In
Pose-Star, we calibrate diffusion-derived attention (Star tokens) via skeletal
keypoints to enhance rare structure localization in complex poses, suppress
noise through phase-aware analysis of attention dynamics
(Convergence,Stabilization,Divergence) with threshold masking and
sliding-window fusion, and refine edges via cross-self attention merging and
Canny alignment. This work bridges controlled benchmarks and open-world
demands, pioneering anatomy-aware, pose-robust editing and laying the
foundation for industrial fashion image editing.

Motivation: 现有防御方法无法抵御未知攻击，导致对抗鲁棒性的泛化问题。为解决这一问题，作者探索了各种攻击的共同特征。

Method: 揭示了对抗样本中的低熵先验（LE），并提出REAL方法，包括基于LE的两阶段修正：反向最大化预测熵和正向最小化预测熵，形成Max-Min熵优化方案。

Result: 实验表明，REAL显著提升了现有样本修正模型的性能。

Conclusion: LE先验和REAL方法为对抗样本的通用鲁棒性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Existing defense methods fail to defend against unknown attacks and thus
raise generalization issue of adversarial robustness. To remedy this problem,
we attempt to delve into some underlying common characteristics among various
attacks for generality. In this work, we reveal the commonly overlooked low
entropy prior (LE) implied in various adversarial samples, and shed light on
the universal robustness against unseen attacks in inference phase. LE prior is
elaborated as two properties across various attacks as shown in Fig. 1 and Fig.
2: 1) low entropy misclassification for adversarial samples and 2) lower
entropy prediction for higher attack intensity. This phenomenon stands in stark
contrast to the naturally distributed samples. The LE prior can instruct
existing test-time defense methods, thus we propose a two-stage REAL approach:
Rectify Adversarial sample based on LE prior for test-time adversarial
rectification. Specifically, to align adversarial samples more closely with
clean samples, we propose to first rectify adversarial samples misclassified
with low entropy by reverse maximizing prediction entropy, thereby eliminating
their adversarial nature. To ensure the rectified samples can be correctly
classified with low entropy, we carry out secondary rectification by forward
minimizing prediction entropy, thus creating a Max-Min entropy optimization
scheme. Further, based on the second property, we propose an attack-aware
weighting mechanism to adaptively adjust the strengths of Max-Min entropy
objectives. Experiments on several datasets show that REAL can greatly improve
the performance of existing sample rectification models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型的数据规模不断扩大，但数据质量与噪声对应问题日益突出，影响模型性能。现有方法需从头训练，资源消耗大。

Method: 提出NCU框架，通过最优传输目标统一去噪过程，学习最难的负样本信息，消除噪声对应关系的影响。

Result: 在CLIP模型上验证，NCU在零样本迁移任务中表现优于现有方法，且计算开销更低。

Conclusion: NCU提供了一种高效的去噪微调方法，显著提升了视觉语言模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The data appetite for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has continuously scaled
up from the early millions to billions today, which faces an untenable
trade-off with data quality and inevitably introduces Noisy Correspondence (NC)
samples. Undoubtedly, such semantically unrelated data significantly impairs
the performance of VLMs. Previous efforts mainly address this challenge by
estimating refined alignment for more precise guidance. However, such
resource-intensive pipelines that train VLMs from scratch struggle to meet
realistic data demands. In this paper, we present a brand new perspective that
seeks to directly eliminate the harmful effects of NC in pre-trained VLMs.
Specifically, we propose NCU, a Noisy Correspondence Unlearning fine-tuning
framework that efficiently enhances VLMs' robustness by forgetting learned
noisy knowledge. The key to NCU is learning the hardest negative information,
which can provide explicit unlearning direction for both false positives and
false negatives. Such twin goals unlearning process can be formalized into one
unified optimal transport objective for fast fine-tuning. We validate our
approach with the prevailing CLIP model over various downstream tasks.
Remarkably, NCU surpasses the robust pre-trained method on zero-shot transfer
while with lower computational overhead. The code will be released upon
acceptance.

Abstract: Robots and autonomous vehicles should be aware of what happens in their
surroundings. The segmentation and tracking of moving objects are essential for
reliable path planning, including collision avoidance. We investigate this
estimation task for vehicles using radar sensing. We address moving instance
tracking in sparse radar point clouds to enhance scene interpretation. We
propose a learning-based radar tracker incorporating temporal offset
predictions to enable direct center-based association and enhance segmentation
performance by including additional motion cues. We implement attention-based
tracking for sparse radar scans to include appearance features and enhance
performance. The final association combines geometric and appearance features
to overcome the limitations of center-based tracking to associate instances
reliably. Our approach shows an improved performance on the moving instance
tracking benchmark of the RadarScenes dataset compared to the current state of
the art.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种方法，通过随机多裁剪增强激活CLIP的局部特征分析能力，解决了其偏向全局图像模式的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统提示工程依赖粗粒度类别标签，忽略了细粒度局部语义，且现有方法假设VLMs能识别局部细节，但实验表明CLIP对全局模式有强烈偏好。

Method: 采用随机多裁剪增强，通过裁剪部分区域限制模型感受野并重新校准注意力机制。

Result: 在零样本、少样本和测试时适应设置下，D&D方法表现出色。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，能够显著提升CLIP对局部细节的处理能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP achieve cross-modal semantic
alignment through contrastive learning, exhibiting robust zero-shot
generalization. Traditional prompt engineering, however, predominantly relies
on coarse-grained category labels, neglecting fine-grained local semantics.
Existing approaches assume that VLMs inherently recognize localized visual
details and attempt to enhance classification by augmenting text prompts with
attribute descriptors generated by large language models. However, our
systematic experiments reveal critical limitations: CLIP's strong bias toward
global image patterns hinders its ability to process localized visual
descriptors. To address this fundamental constraint, we propose a simple,
effective, and plug-and-play solution that enables CLIP to ``See Both the
Forest and the Trees." Specifically, we employ stochastic multi-crop
augmentation to activate CLIP's latent capacity for localized feature analysis.
By cropping only partial regions, the approach effectively constrains the
model's receptive field and recalibrates its attention mechanism, thereby
mitigating its inherent bias. We evaluate the proposed method under zero-shot,
few-shot, and test-time adaptation settings, and extensive experiments
demonstrate that D&D achieves promising performance.

Result: QAA在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法，保持与数据集专用模型相当的峰值性能。

Conclusion: QAA是一种高效且可扩展的特征聚合方法，能够提升VPR模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Deep learning methods for Visual Place Recognition (VPR) have advanced
significantly, largely driven by large-scale datasets. However, most existing
approaches are trained on a single dataset, which can introduce
dataset-specific inductive biases and limit model generalization. While
multi-dataset joint training offers a promising solution for developing
universal VPR models, divergences among training datasets can saturate limited
information capacity in feature aggregation layers, leading to suboptimal
performance. To address these challenges, we propose Query-based Adaptive
Aggregation (QAA), a novel feature aggregation technique that leverages learned
queries as reference codebooks to effectively enhance information capacity
without significant computational or parameter complexity. We show that
computing the Cross-query Similarity (CS) between query-level image features
and reference codebooks provides a simple yet effective way to generate robust
descriptors. Our results demonstrate that QAA outperforms state-of-the-art
models, achieving balanced generalization across diverse datasets while
maintaining peak performance comparable to dataset-specific models. Ablation
studies further explore QAA's mechanisms and scalability. Visualizations reveal
that the learned queries exhibit diverse attention patterns across datasets.
Code will be publicly released.

Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆需要实时感知周围移动物体，而现有方法通常依赖时间序列数据。雷达传感器直接提供速度信息，但点云稀疏且噪声大，需高效分割方法。

Method: 开发了Radar Velocity Transformer，利用速度信息进行单次扫描分割，并提出基于Transformer的上采样方法以提升稀疏点云性能。

Result: 方法在RadarScenes数据集上表现优异，速度快于传感器帧率，仅需单次扫描即可实现精确分割。

Conclusion: 该方法为自动驾驶提供了高效的雷达移动物体分割方案，克服了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: The awareness about moving objects in the surroundings of a self-driving
vehicle is essential for safe and reliable autonomous navigation. The
interpretation of LiDAR and camera data achieves exceptional results but
typically requires to accumulate and process temporal sequences of data in
order to extract motion information. In contrast, radar sensors, which are
already installed in most recent vehicles, can overcome this limitation as they
directly provide the Doppler velocity of the detections and, hence incorporate
instantaneous motion information within a single measurement. % In this paper,
we tackle the problem of moving object segmentation in noisy radar point
clouds. We also consider differentiating parked from moving cars, to enhance
scene understanding. Instead of exploiting temporal dependencies to identify
moving objects, we develop a novel transformer-based approach to perform
single-scan moving object segmentation in sparse radar scans accurately. The
key to our Radar Velocity Transformer is to incorporate the valuable velocity
information throughout each module of the network, thereby enabling the precise
segmentation of moving and non-moving objects. Additionally, we propose a
transformer-based upsampling, which enhances the performance by adaptively
combining information and overcoming the limitation of interpolation of sparse
point clouds. Finally, we create a new radar moving object segmentation
benchmark based on the RadarScenes dataset and compare our approach to other
state-of-the-art methods. Our network runs faster than the frame rate of the
sensor and shows superior segmentation results using only single-scan radar
data.

Conclusion: 该框架通过低成本传感器数据实现了高性能场景流估计，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: This work proposes a mmWave radar's scene flow estimation framework
supervised by data from a widespread visual-inertial (VI) sensor suite,
allowing crowdsourced training data from smart vehicles. Current scene flow
estimation methods for mmWave radar are typically supervised by dense point
clouds from 3D LiDARs, which are expensive and not widely available in smart
vehicles. While VI data are more accessible, visual images alone cannot capture
the 3D motions of moving objects, making it difficult to supervise their scene
flow. Moreover, the temporal drift of VI rigid transformation also degenerates
the scene flow estimation of static points. To address these challenges, we
propose a drift-free rigid transformation estimator that fuses kinematic
model-based ego-motions with neural network-learned results. It provides strong
supervision signals to radar-based rigid transformation and infers the scene
flow of static points. Then, we develop an optical-mmWave supervision
extraction module that extracts the supervision signals of radar rigid
transformation and scene flow. It strengthens the supervision by learning the
scene flow of dynamic points with the joint constraints of optical and mmWave
radar measurements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, in smoke-filled
environments, our method even outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches
using costly LiDARs.

Result: 在街景和遥感数据集上，BiCD实现了基于BNN的变化检测的最新性能。

Conclusion: BiCD为二值神经网络在变化检测领域设定了新基准，具有高效和有效的优化策略。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Binarized Change Detection (BiCD), the first binary
neural network (BNN) designed specifically for change detection. Conventional
network binarization approaches, which directly quantize both weights and
activations in change detection models, severely limit the network's ability to
represent input data and distinguish between changed and unchanged regions.
This results in significantly lower detection accuracy compared to real-valued
networks. To overcome these challenges, BiCD enhances both the representational
power and feature separability of BNNs, improving detection performance.
Specifically, we introduce an auxiliary objective based on the Information
Bottleneck (IB) principle, guiding the encoder to retain essential input
information while promoting better feature discrimination. Since directly
computing mutual information under the IB principle is intractable, we design a
compact, learnable auxiliary module as an approximation target, leading to a
simple yet effective optimization strategy that minimizes both reconstruction
loss and standard change detection loss. Extensive experiments on street-view
and remote sensing datasets demonstrate that BiCD establishes a new benchmark
for BNN-based change detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance in this
domain.

Abstract: Birds' Eye View (BEV) semantic segmentation is an indispensable perception
task in end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Unsupervised and semi-supervised
learning for BEV tasks, as pivotal for real-world applications, underperform
due to the homogeneous distribution of the labeled data. In this work, we
explore the potential of synthetic data from driving world models to enhance
the diversity of labeled data for robustifying BEV segmentation. Yet, our
preliminary findings reveal that generation noise in synthetic data compromises
efficient BEV model learning. To fully harness the potential of synthetic data
from world models, this paper proposes NRSeg, a noise-resilient learning
framework for BEV semantic segmentation. Specifically, a Perspective-Geometry
Consistency Metric (PGCM) is proposed to quantitatively evaluate the guidance
capability of generated data for model learning. This metric originates from
the alignment measure between the perspective road mask of generated data and
the mask projected from the BEV labels. Moreover, a Bi-Distribution Parallel
Prediction (BiDPP) is designed to enhance the inherent robustness of the model,
where the learning process is constrained through parallel prediction of
multinomial and Dirichlet distributions. The former efficiently predicts
semantic probabilities, whereas the latter adopts evidential deep learning to
realize uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, a Hierarchical Local Semantic
Exclusion (HLSE) module is designed to address the non-mutual exclusivity
inherent in BEV semantic segmentation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate
that NRSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding the highest
improvements in mIoU of 13.8% and 11.4% in unsupervised and semi-supervised BEV
segmentation tasks, respectively. The source code will be made publicly

Conclusion: 多模态融合策略在细粒度视频分类任务中表现出色，跨注意力和特征增强是关键因素。

Abstract: Fine-grained video classification requires understanding complex
spatio-temporal and semantic cues that often exceed the capacity of a single
modality. In this paper, we propose a multimodal framework that fuses video,
image, and text representations using GRU-based sequence encoders and
cross-modal attention mechanisms. The model is trained using a combination of
classification or regression loss, depending on the task, and is further
regularized through feature-level augmentation and autoencoding techniques. To
evaluate the generality of our framework, we conduct experiments on two
challenging benchmarks: the DVD dataset for real-world violence detection and
the Aff-Wild2 dataset for valence-arousal estimation. Our results demonstrate
that the proposed fusion strategy significantly outperforms unimodal baselines,
with cross-attention and feature augmentation contributing notably to
robustness and performance.

Abstract: Most end-to-end autonomous driving methods rely on imitation learning from
single expert demonstrations, often leading to conservative and homogeneous
behaviors that limit generalization in complex real-world scenarios. In this
work, we propose DIVER, an end-to-end driving framework that integrates
reinforcement learning with diffusion-based generation to produce diverse and
feasible trajectories. At the core of DIVER lies a reinforced diffusion-based
generation mechanism. First, the model conditions on map elements and
surrounding agents to generate multiple reference trajectories from a single
ground-truth trajectory, alleviating the limitations of imitation learning that
arise from relying solely on single expert demonstrations. Second,
reinforcement learning is employed to guide the diffusion process, where
reward-based supervision enforces safety and diversity constraints on the
generated trajectories, thereby enhancing their practicality and generalization
capability. Furthermore, to address the limitations of L2-based open-loop
metrics in capturing trajectory diversity, we propose a novel Diversity metric
to evaluate the diversity of multi-mode predictions.Extensive experiments on
the closed-loop NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks, as well as the open-loop
nuScenes dataset, demonstrate that DIVER significantly improves trajectory
diversity, effectively addressing the mode collapse problem inherent in
imitation learning.

TL;DR: PhenoBench是一个用于细胞表型分析的基准测试，包括新的数据集PhenoCell和评估代码，揭示了现有基础模型在细胞表型任务中的性能差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型在细胞表型分析中缺乏统一的性能评估，因此需要一个新的基准测试。

Method: 提出PhenoBench基准，包含PhenoCell数据集和评估代码，用于测试多种基础模型在不同泛化场景下的表现。

Result: 现有模型在PhenoCell上的表现（F1分数低至0.20）显著低于其他基准（如Lizard和PanNuke），表明任务更具挑战性。

Conclusion: PhenoCell是一个更严格的基准，适合未来模型评估。

Abstract: Digital pathology has seen the advent of a wealth of foundational models
(FM), yet to date their performance on cell phenotyping has not been
benchmarked in a unified manner. We therefore propose PhenoBench: A
comprehensive benchmark for cell phenotyping on Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)
stained histopathology images. We provide both PhenoCell, a new H&E dataset
featuring 14 granular cell types identified by using multiplexed imaging, and
ready-to-use fine-tuning and benchmarking code that allows the systematic
evaluation of multiple prominent pathology FMs in terms of dense cell phenotype
predictions in different generalization scenarios. We perform extensive
benchmarking of existing FMs, providing insights into their generalization
behavior under technical vs. medical domain shifts. Furthermore, while FMs
achieve macro F1 scores > 0.70 on previously established benchmarks such as
Lizard and PanNuke, on PhenoCell, we observe scores as low as 0.20. This
indicates a much more challenging task not captured by previous benchmarks,
establishing PhenoCell as a prime asset for future benchmarking of FMs and
supervised models alike. Code and data are available on GitHub.

TL;DR: CLOT是一种基于最优传输（OT）的新框架，通过多级循环特征学习机制改进无监督动作分割，解决了ASOT缺乏段级监督的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASOT在无监督动作分割中表现优异，但缺乏段级监督限制了帧与动作表示之间的反馈效果。

Method: CLOT通过编码器-解码器架构，解决两个独立的OT问题，学习伪标签和帧/段嵌入，并通过交叉注意力优化帧嵌入和伪标签。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，循环学习对无监督动作分割有显著提升。

Conclusion: CLOT通过引入多级循环学习机制，显著提升了无监督动作分割的性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised action segmentation has recently pushed its limits with ASOT, an
optimal transport (OT)-based method that simultaneously learns action
representations and performs clustering using pseudo-labels. Unlike other
OT-based approaches, ASOT makes no assumptions on the action ordering, and it
is able to decode a temporally consistent segmentation from a noisy cost matrix
between video frames and action labels. However, the resulting segmentation
lacks segment-level supervision, which limits the effectiveness of the feedback
between frames and action representations. To address this limitation, we
propose Closed Loop Optimal Transport (CLOT), a novel OT-based framework that
introduces a multi-level cyclic feature learning mechanism. Leveraging its
encoder-decoder architecture, CLOT learns pseudo-labels alongside frame and
segment embeddings by solving two separate OT problems. It then refines both
frame embeddings and pseudo-labels through cross-attention between the learned
frame and segment embeddings, integrating a third OT problem. Experimental
results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the benefits of cyclical
learning for unsupervised action segmentation.

Conclusion: Driver-Net作为实时、非侵入式解决方案，有助于开发更安全可靠的自动驾驶车辆，并符合新法规和安全标准。

Abstract: Ensuring safe transition of control in automated vehicles requires an
accurate and timely assessment of driver readiness. This paper introduces
Driver-Net, a novel deep learning framework that fuses multi-camera inputs to
estimate driver take-over readiness. Unlike conventional vision-based driver
monitoring systems that focus on head pose or eye gaze, Driver-Net captures
synchronised visual cues from the driver's head, hands, and body posture
through a triple-camera setup. The model integrates spatio-temporal data using
a dual-path architecture, comprising a Context Block and a Feature Block,
followed by a cross-modal fusion strategy to enhance prediction accuracy.
Evaluated on a diverse dataset collected from the University of Leeds Driving
Simulator, the proposed method achieves an accuracy of up to 95.8% in driver
readiness classification. This performance significantly enhances existing
approaches and highlights the importance of multimodal and multi-view fusion.
As a real-time, non-intrusive solution, Driver-Net contributes meaningfully to
the development of safer and more reliable automated vehicles and aligns with
new regulatory mandates and upcoming safety standards.

Motivation: 探讨通用基础模型与领域特定模型在人脸识别任务中的表现差异，并探索如何结合两者以提升性能。

Method: 通过多个基准数据集和实验，比较零样本通用基础模型与领域特定模型的性能，并尝试模型融合。

Result: 领域特定模型在零样本任务中表现更优；通用模型在上下文丰富的图像中表现更好；两者融合可显著提升性能；通用模型还能为识别过程提供解释性。

Conclusion: 结合领域特定模型与通用基础模型可以提升人脸识别性能，并为识别过程增加解释性。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the following question: How do generic foundation
models (e.g., CLIP, BLIP, LLaVa, DINO) compare against a domain-specific face
recognition model (viz., AdaFace or ArcFace) on the face recognition task?
Through a series of experiments involving several foundation models and
benchmark datasets, we are able to report the following findings: (a) In all
datasets considered, domain-specific models outperformed zero-shot foundation
models. (b) The performance of zero-shot generic foundation models improves on
over-segmented face images than tightly cropped faces thereby suggesting the
importance of contextual clues. For example, at a False Match Rate (FMR) of
0.01%, the True Match Rate (TMR) of OpenCLIP improved from 64.97% to 81.73% on
the LFW dataset as the face crop increased from 112x112 to 250x250 while the
TMR of domain-specific AdaFace dropped from 99.09% to 77.31%. (c) A simple
score-level fusion of a foundation model with a domain-specific FR model
improved the accuracy at low FMRs. For example, the TMR of AdaFace when fused
with BLIP improved from 72.64% to 83.31% at an FMR of 0.0001% on the IJB-B
dataset and from 73.17% to 85.81% on the IJB-C dataset. (d) Foundation models,
such as ChatGPT, can be used to impart explainability to the FR pipeline (e.g.,
``Despite minor lighting and head tilt differences, the two left-profile images
show high consistency in forehead slope, nose shape, chin contour...''). In
some instances, foundation models are even able to resolve low-confidence
decisions made by AdaFace (e.g., ``Although AdaFace assigns a low similarity
score of 0.21, both images exhibit visual similarity...and the pair is likely
of the same person''), thereby reiterating the importance of combining
domain-specific FR models with generic foundation models in a judicious manner.

Abstract: Prediction of pedestrian crossing intention is a critical function in
autonomous vehicles. Conventional vision-based methods of crossing intention
prediction often struggle with generalizability, context understanding, and
causal reasoning. This study explores the potential of vision-language
foundation models (VLFMs) for predicting pedestrian crossing intentions by
integrating multimodal data through hierarchical prompt templates. The
methodology incorporates contextual information, including visual frames,
physical cues observations, and ego-vehicle dynamics, into systematically
refined prompts to guide VLFMs effectively in intention prediction. Experiments
were conducted on three common datasets-JAAD, PIE, and FU-PIP. Results
demonstrate that incorporating vehicle speed, its variations over time, and
time-conscious prompts significantly enhances the prediction accuracy up to
19.8%. Additionally, optimised prompts generated via an automatic prompt
engineering framework yielded 12.5% further accuracy gains. These findings
highlight the superior performance of VLFMs compared to conventional
vision-based models, offering enhanced generalisation and contextual
understanding for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Text-based visual descriptors-ranging from simple class names to more
descriptive phrases-are widely used in visual concept discovery and image
classification with vision-language models (VLMs). Their effectiveness,
however, depends on a complex interplay of factors, including semantic clarity,
presence in the VLM's pre-training data, and how well the descriptors serve as
a meaningful representation space. In this work, we systematically analyze
descriptor quality along two key dimensions: (1) representational capacity, and
(2) relationship with VLM pre-training data. We evaluate a spectrum of
descriptor generation methods, from zero-shot LLM-generated prompts to
iteratively refined descriptors. Motivated by ideas from representation
alignment and language understanding, we introduce two alignment-based
metrics-Global Alignment and CLIP Similarity-that move beyond accuracy. These
metrics allow us to shed light on how different descriptor generation
strategies interact with foundation model properties, offering insights into
ways of studying descriptor effectiveness beyond accuracy evaluations.

Conclusion: DreamVLA通过整合多模态推理链和结构化注意力机制，显著提升了机器人操作的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise in
integrating image generation with action prediction to improve generalization
and reasoning in robot manipulation. However, existing methods are limited to
challenging image-based forecasting, which suffers from redundant information
and lacks comprehensive and critical world knowledge, including dynamic,
spatial and semantic information. To address these limitations, we propose
DreamVLA, a novel VLA framework that integrates comprehensive world knowledge
forecasting to enable inverse dynamics modeling, thereby establishing a
perception-prediction-action loop for manipulation tasks. Specifically,
DreamVLA introduces a dynamic-region-guided world knowledge prediction,
integrated with the spatial and semantic cues, which provide compact yet
comprehensive representations for action planning. This design aligns with how
humans interact with the world by first forming abstract multimodal reasoning
chains before acting. To mitigate interference among the dynamic, spatial and
semantic information during training, we adopt a block-wise structured
attention mechanism that masks their mutual attention, preventing information
leakage and keeping each representation clean and disentangled. Moreover, to
model the conditional distribution over future actions, we employ a
diffusion-based transformer that disentangles action representations from
shared latent features. Extensive experiments on both real-world and simulation
environments demonstrate that DreamVLA achieves 76.7% success rate on real
robot tasks and 4.44 average length on the CALVIN ABC-D benchmarks.

Conclusion: 轻量级预训练模型结合优化和分类技术对脑卒中诊断非常有效。

Abstract: Brain stroke is one of the leading causes of mortality and long-term
disability worldwide, highlighting the need for precise and fast prediction
techniques. Computed Tomography (CT) scan is considered one of the most
effective methods for diagnosing brain strokes. The majority of stroke
classification techniques rely on a single slice-level prediction mechanism,
allowing the radiologist to manually choose the most critical CT slice from the
original CT volume. Although clinical evaluations are often used in traditional
diagnostic procedures, machine learning (ML) has opened up new avenues for
improving stroke diagnosis. To supplement traditional diagnostic techniques,
this study investigates the use of machine learning models, specifically
concerning the prediction of brain stroke at an early stage utilizing CT scan
images. In this research, we proposed a novel approach to brain stroke
detection leveraging machine learning techniques, focusing on optimizing
classification performance with pre-trained deep learning models and advanced
optimization strategies. Pre-trained models, including DenseNet201,
InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, ResNet50, and Xception, are utilized for feature
extraction. Additionally, we employed feature engineering techniques, including
BFO, PCA, and LDA, to enhance models' performance further. These features are
subsequently classified using machine learning algorithms such as SVC, RF, XGB,
DT, LR, KNN, and GNB. Our experiments demonstrate that the combination of
MobileNetV2, LDA, and SVC achieved the highest classification accuracy of
97.93%, significantly outperforming other model-optimizer-classifier
combinations. The results underline the effectiveness of integrating
lightweight pre-trained models with robust optimization and classification
techniques for brain stroke diagnosis.

Abstract: Accurate localization using visual information is a critical yet challenging
task, especially in urban environments where nearby buildings and construction
sites significantly degrade GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) signal
quality. This issue underscores the importance of visual localization
techniques in scenarios where GNSS signals are unreliable. This paper proposes
U-ViLAR, a novel uncertainty-aware visual localization framework designed to
address these challenges while enabling adaptive localization using
high-definition (HD) maps or navigation maps. Specifically, our method first
extracts features from the input visual data and maps them into Bird's-Eye-View
(BEV) space to enhance spatial consistency with the map input. Subsequently, we
introduce: a) Perceptual Uncertainty-guided Association, which mitigates errors
caused by perception uncertainty, and b) Localization Uncertainty-guided
Registration, which reduces errors introduced by localization uncertainty. By
effectively balancing the coarse-grained large-scale localization capability of
association with the fine-grained precise localization capability of
registration, our approach achieves robust and accurate localization.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple localization tasks. Furthermore, our model has
undergone rigorous testing on large-scale autonomous driving fleets and has
demonstrated stable performance in various challenging urban scenarios.

Abstract: Pavement skid resistance is of vital importance for road safety. The
objective of this study is to propose and validate a texture-based image
indicator to predict pavement friction. This index enables pavement friction to
be measured easily and inexpensively using digital images. Three different
types of asphalt surfaces (dense-graded asphalt mix, open-grade friction
course, and chip seal) were evaluated subject to various tire polishing cycles.
Images were taken with corresponding friction measured using Dynamic Friction
Tester (DFT) in the laboratory. The aggregate protrusion area is proposed as
the indicator. Statistical models are established for each asphalt surface type
to correlate the proposed indicator with friction coefficients. The results
show that the adjusted R-square values of all relationships are above 0.90.
Compared to other image-based indicators in the literature, the proposed image
indicator more accurately reflects the changes in pavement friction with the
number of polishing cycles, proving its cost-effective use for considering
pavement friction in mix design stage.

Conclusion: 该研究为空间接地的姿态生成和多模态交互研究奠定了基础，推动了具身交互代理的发展。

Abstract: Human motion generation has advanced rapidly in recent years, yet the
critical problem of creating spatially grounded, context-aware gestures has
been largely overlooked. Existing models typically specialize either in
descriptive motion generation, such as locomotion and object interaction, or in
isolated co-speech gesture synthesis aligned with utterance semantics. However,
both lines of work often treat motion and environmental grounding separately,
limiting advances toward embodied, communicative agents. To address this gap,
our work introduces a multimodal dataset and framework for grounded gesture
generation, combining two key resources: (1) a synthetic dataset of spatially
grounded referential gestures, and (2) MM-Conv, a VR-based dataset capturing
two-party dialogues. Together, they provide over 7.7 hours of synchronized
motion, speech, and 3D scene information, standardized in the HumanML3D format.
Our framework further connects to a physics-based simulator, enabling synthetic
data generation and situated evaluation. By bridging gesture modeling and
spatial grounding, our contribution establishes a foundation for advancing
research in situated gesture generation and grounded multimodal interaction.

Abstract: On-board sensors of autonomous vehicles can be obstructed, occluded, or
limited by restricted fields of view, complicating downstream driving
decisions. Intelligent roadside infrastructure perception systems, installed at
elevated vantage points, can provide wide, unobstructed intersection coverage,
supplying a complementary information stream to autonomous vehicles via
vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. However, conventional 3D
object-detection algorithms struggle to generalize under the domain shift
introduced by top-down perspectives and steep camera angles. We introduce a
2.5D object detection framework, tailored specifically for infrastructure
roadside-mounted cameras. Unlike conventional 2D or 3D object detection, we
employ a prediction approach to detect ground planes of vehicles as
parallelograms in the image frame. The parallelogram preserves the planar
position, size, and orientation of objects while omitting their height, which
is unnecessary for most downstream applications. For training, a mix of
real-world and synthetically generated scenes is leveraged. We evaluate
generalizability on a held-out camera viewpoint and in adverse-weather
scenarios absent from the training set. Our results show high detection
accuracy, strong cross-viewpoint generalization, and robustness to diverse
lighting and weather conditions. Model weights and inference code are provided

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a proliferation of spatiotemporal foundation
models in different scientific disciplines. While promising, these models are
often domain-specific and are only assessed within the particular applications
for which they are designed. Given that many tasks can be represented as video
modeling problems, video foundation models (ViFMs) hold considerable promise as
general-purpose domain-agnostic approaches. However, it is not known whether
the knowledge acquired on large-scale but potentially out-of-domain data can be
effectively transferred across diverse scientific disciplines, and if a single,
pretrained ViFM can be competitive with domain-specific baselines. To address
this, we introduce SciVid, a comprehensive benchmark comprising five
*Sci*entific *Vid*eo tasks, across medical computer vision, animal behavior,
and weather forecasting. We adapt six leading ViFMs to SciVid using simple
trainable readout modules, establishing strong baselines and demonstrating the
potential for effective transfer learning. Specifically, we show that
state-of-the-art results can be obtained in several applications by leveraging
the general-purpose representations from ViFM backbones. Furthermore, our
results reveal the limitations of existing ViFMs, and highlight opportunities
for the development of generalizable models for high-impact scientific

Method: 结合LoRA和MoE模块，动态选择专家并优化特征提取，引入轻量级决策网络控制计算开销。

Result: 在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的跨域和联合泛化性能。

Conclusion: SMoEStereo有效提升了立体匹配的鲁棒性和效率，无需特定数据集适配。

Abstract: Recently, learning-based stereo matching networks have advanced
significantly. However, they often lack robustness and struggle to achieve
impressive cross-domain performance due to domain shifts and imbalanced
disparity distributions among diverse datasets. Leveraging Vision Foundation
Models (VFMs) can intuitively enhance the model's robustness, but integrating
such a model into stereo matching cost-effectively to fully realize their
robustness remains a key challenge. To address this, we propose SMoEStereo, a
novel framework that adapts VFMs for stereo matching through a tailored,
scene-specific fusion of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) modules. SMoEStereo introduces MoE-LoRA with adaptive ranks and
MoE-Adapter with adaptive kernel sizes. The former dynamically selects optimal
experts within MoE to adapt varying scenes across domains, while the latter
injects inductive bias into frozen VFMs to improve geometric feature
extraction. Importantly, to mitigate computational overhead, we further propose
a lightweight decision network that selectively activates MoE modules based on
input complexity, balancing efficiency with accuracy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method exhibits state-of-the-art cross-domain and joint
generalization across multiple benchmarks without dataset-specific adaptation.

TL;DR: 论文提出Causal-SAM-LLM框架，通过语言对抗解耦和测试时因果干预提升医学图像分割模型的泛化能力，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在医学图像分割中因学习虚假相关性而泛化能力差的问题。

Method: 结合语言对抗解耦（LAD）和测试时因果干预（TCI），利用LLM作为因果推理器，提升模型鲁棒性。

Result: 在跨扫描器、跨模态和跨解剖结构的评估中，平均Dice分数提升6.2分，Hausdorff距离减少15.8毫米。

Conclusion: Causal-SAM-LLM为构建鲁棒、高效且可交互控制的医学AI系统提供了新方向。

Abstract: The clinical utility of deep learning models for medical image segmentation
is severely constrained by their inability to generalize to unseen domains.
This failure is often rooted in the models learning spurious correlations
between anatomical content and domain-specific imaging styles. To overcome this
fundamental challenge, we introduce Causal-SAM-LLM, a novel framework that
elevates Large Language Models (LLMs) to the role of causal reasoners. Our
framework, built upon a frozen Segment Anything Model (SAM) encoder,
incorporates two synergistic innovations. First, Linguistic Adversarial
Disentanglement (LAD) employs a Vision-Language Model to generate rich, textual
descriptions of confounding image styles. By training the segmentation model's
features to be contrastively dissimilar to these style descriptions, it learns
a representation robustly purged of non-causal information. Second, Test-Time
Causal Intervention (TCI) provides an interactive mechanism where an LLM
interprets a clinician's natural language command to modulate the segmentation
decoder's features in real-time, enabling targeted error correction. We conduct
an extensive empirical evaluation on a composite benchmark from four public
datasets (BTCV, CHAOS, AMOS, BraTS), assessing generalization under
cross-scanner, cross-modality, and cross-anatomy settings. Causal-SAM-LLM
establishes a new state of the art in out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness,
improving the average Dice score by up to 6.2 points and reducing the Hausdorff
Distance by 15.8 mm over the strongest baseline, all while using less than 9%
of the full model's trainable parameters. Our work charts a new course for
building robust, efficient, and interactively controllable medical AI systems.

Motivation: 现有VLA模型在新对象或陌生环境中的泛化能力有限，且引入额外组件会增加计算开销，因此需要探索高效的动作预测方法。

Result: 实验表明，VOTE框架在性能上达到最优，推理速度提升35倍，吞吐量为145 Hz。

Conclusion: VOTE框架高效且泛化能力强，适合实际应用，代码将开源。

Abstract: Recent large-scale Vision Language Action (VLA) models have shown superior
performance in robotic manipulation tasks guided by natural language. However,
their generalization remains limited when applied to novel objects or
unfamiliar environments that lie outside the training distribution. To address
this, many existing approaches integrate additional components such as depth
estimation, segmentation, or even diffusion to improve generalization, at the
cost of adding significant computation overhead, resulting in low efficiency.
This motivates the exploration of efficient action prediction methods, which
are independent of additional high-level visual representations or diffusion
techniques. In this work, we propose VOTE, an efficient and general framework
for the optimization and acceleration of VLA models. In details, we propose a
novel tokenizer-free fine-tuning approach for parallel accurate action
prediction, which reduces computational overhead and accelerates inference
speed. Additionally, we adopt an ensemble voting strategy for the action
sampling, which significantly improves model performance and enhances
generalization. Experimental results show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance with 35$\times$ faster inference and 145 Hz
throughput. All the details and codes will be open-sourced.

TL;DR: EEG-VJEPA是一种基于V-JEPA的自监督学习方法，用于EEG信号分类，通过联合嵌入和自适应掩码学习时空特征，在TUH数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号分析面临标记数据少、高维度和缺乏捕捉时空依赖的模型等问题，现有自监督学习方法仅关注空间或时间特征，效果不佳。

Method: 将EEG信号视为视频序列，采用V-JEPA框架，通过联合嵌入和自适应掩码学习时空表示。

Result: 在TUH异常EEG数据集上分类准确率优于现有方法，并能捕捉生理相关的时空模式。

Conclusion: EEG-VJEPA为临床EEG分析提供了可扩展且可信的框架，支持人机协作诊断。

Abstract: EEG signals capture brain activity with high temporal and low spatial
resolution, supporting applications such as neurological diagnosis, cognitive
monitoring, and brain-computer interfaces. However, effective analysis is
hindered by limited labeled data, high dimensionality, and the absence of
scalable models that fully capture spatiotemporal dependencies. Existing
self-supervised learning (SSL) methods often focus on either spatial or
temporal features, leading to suboptimal representations. To this end, we
propose EEG-VJEPA, a novel adaptation of the Video Joint Embedding Predictive
Architecture (V-JEPA) for EEG classification. By treating EEG as video-like
sequences, EEG-VJEPA learns semantically meaningful spatiotemporal
representations using joint embeddings and adaptive masking. To our knowledge,
this is the first work that exploits V-JEPA for EEG classification and explores
the visual concepts learned by the model. Evaluations on the publicly available
Temple University Hospital (TUH) Abnormal EEG dataset show that EEG-VJEPA
outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in classification accuracy.Beyond
classification accuracy, EEG-VJEPA captures physiologically relevant spatial
and temporal signal patterns, offering interpretable embeddings that may
support human-AI collaboration in diagnostic workflows. These findings position
EEG-VJEPA as a promising framework for scalable, trustworthy EEG analysis in
real-world clinical settings.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法仅关注文本模态的原型学习，忽略了类名的模糊语义，导致原型无法充分捕捉视觉概念，性能受限。

Method: ProtoMM构建多模态原型，将原型视为文本描述和视觉粒子的离散分布，动态更新视觉粒子，并通过最优传输问题量化原型和测试图像的语义距离。

Result: 在15个零样本基准测试中，ProtoMM平均准确率提升1.03%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ProtoMM通过多模态原型动态学习和语义距离优化，显著提升了视觉语言模型在测试时的适应能力。

Abstract: With the increasing attention to pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs),
\eg, CLIP, substantial efforts have been devoted to many downstream tasks,
especially in test-time adaptation (TTA). However, previous works focus on
learning prototypes only in the textual modality while overlooking the
ambiguous semantics in class names. These ambiguities lead to textual
prototypes that are insufficient to capture visual concepts, resulting in
limited performance. To address this issue, we introduce \textbf{ProtoMM}, a
training-free framework that constructs multimodal prototypes to adapt VLMs
during the test time. By viewing the prototype as a discrete distribution over
the textual descriptions and visual particles, ProtoMM has the ability to
combine the multimodal features for comprehensive prototype learning. More
importantly, the visual particles are dynamically updated as the testing stream
flows. This allows our multimodal prototypes to continually learn from the
data, enhancing their generalizability in unseen scenarios. In addition, we
quantify the importance of the prototypes and test images by formulating their
semantic distance as an optimal transport problem. Extensive experiments on 15
zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving a
1.03\% average accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art methods on ImageNet
and its variant datasets.

Motivation: 探索视觉嵌入模型是否能通过线性方向捕捉连续有序属性，并验证其在实际应用中的潜力。

Method: 通过7种流行编码器和9个数据集，测试模型在年龄、人群数量等属性上的排名能力。

Result: 许多嵌入模型天然具备排名能力，仅需少量样本即可恢复有意义的排名轴。

Conclusion: 研究为图像排名在向量数据库中的应用提供了新思路，并推动了对可排名嵌入结构的进一步研究。

Abstract: We study whether visual embedding models capture continuous, ordinal
attributes along linear directions, which we term _rank axes_. We define a
model as _rankable_ for an attribute if projecting embeddings onto such an axis
preserves the attribute's order. Across 7 popular encoders and 9 datasets with
attributes like age, crowd count, head pose, aesthetics, and recency, we find
that many embeddings are inherently rankable. Surprisingly, a small number of
samples, or even just two extreme examples, often suffice to recover meaningful
rank axes, without full-scale supervision. These findings open up new use cases
for image ranking in vector databases and motivate further study into the
structure and learning of rankable embeddings. Our code is available at

Abstract: LiDAR representation learning aims to extract rich structural and semantic
information from large-scale, readily available datasets, reducing reliance on
costly human annotations. However, existing LiDAR representation strategies
often overlook the inherent spatiotemporal cues in LiDAR sequences, limiting
their effectiveness. In this work, we propose LiMA, a novel long-term
image-to-LiDAR Memory Aggregation framework that explicitly captures longer
range temporal correlations to enhance LiDAR representation learning. LiMA
comprises three key components: 1) a Cross-View Aggregation module that aligns
and fuses overlapping regions across neighboring camera views, constructing a
more unified and redundancy-free memory bank; 2) a Long-Term Feature
Propagation mechanism that efficiently aligns and integrates multi-frame image
features, reinforcing temporal coherence during LiDAR representation learning;
and 3) a Cross-Sequence Memory Alignment strategy that enforces consistency
across driving sequences, improving generalization to unseen environments. LiMA
maintains high pretraining efficiency and incurs no additional computational
overhead during downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on mainstream
LiDAR-based perception benchmarks demonstrate that LiMA significantly improves
both LiDAR semantic segmentation and 3D object detection. We hope this work
inspires more effective pretraining paradigms for autonomous driving. The code
has be made publicly accessible for future research.

Conclusion: SAMed-2通过创新设计有效解决了医学图像分割中的关键问题，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent "segment anything" efforts show promise by learning from large-scale
data, but adapting such models directly to medical images remains challenging
due to the complexity of medical data, noisy annotations, and continual
learning requirements across diverse modalities and anatomical structures. In
this work, we propose SAMed-2, a new foundation model for medical image
segmentation built upon the SAM-2 architecture. Specifically, we introduce a
temporal adapter into the image encoder to capture image correlations and a
confidence-driven memory mechanism to store high-certainty features for later
retrieval. This memory-based strategy counters the pervasive noise in
large-scale medical datasets and mitigates catastrophic forgetting when
encountering new tasks or modalities. To train and evaluate SAMed-2, we curate
MedBank-100k, a comprehensive dataset spanning seven imaging modalities and 21
medical segmentation tasks. Our experiments on both internal benchmarks and 10
external datasets demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art
baselines in multi-task scenarios. The code is available at:

Motivation: 解决手语翻译中数据稀缺问题，提升标志定位的准确性和灵活性。

Method: 结合全局时空特征和手形特征，通过动态时间规整和余弦相似度匹配大规模标志词典，并利用LLM进行上下文感知的消歧。

Result: 在合成和真实手语数据集上表现出更高的准确性和句子流畅性。

Conclusion: 展示了LLM在手语标志定位中的潜力，为无训练方法提供了新思路。

Abstract: Sign spotting, the task of identifying and localizing individual signs within
continuous sign language video, plays a pivotal role in scaling dataset
annotations and addressing the severe data scarcity issue in sign language
translation. While automatic sign spotting holds great promise for enabling
frame-level supervision at scale, it grapples with challenges such as
vocabulary inflexibility and ambiguity inherent in continuous sign streams.
Hence, we introduce a novel, training-free framework that integrates Large
Language Models (LLMs) to significantly enhance sign spotting quality. Our
approach extracts global spatio-temporal and hand shape features, which are
then matched against a large-scale sign dictionary using dynamic time warping
and cosine similarity. This dictionary-based matching inherently offers
superior vocabulary flexibility without requiring model retraining. To mitigate
noise and ambiguity from the matching process, an LLM performs context-aware
gloss disambiguation via beam search, notably without fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world sign language datasets demonstrate
our method's superior accuracy and sentence fluency compared to traditional
approaches, highlighting the potential of LLMs in advancing sign spotting.

Result: 计算需求比现有模块低18倍，准确率达88%。

Conclusion: 该系统适合工业和住宅安全领域的广泛应用。

Abstract: Existing pre-impact fall detection systems have high accuracy, however they
are either intrusive to the subject or require heavy computational resources
for fall detection, resulting in prohibitive deployment costs. These factors
limit the global adoption of existing fall detection systems. In this work we
present a Pre-impact fall detection system that is both non-intrusive and
computationally efficient at deployment. Our system utilizes video data of the
locality available through cameras, thereby requiring no specialized equipment
to be worn by the subject. Further, the fall detection system utilizes minimal
fall specific features and simplistic neural network models, designed to reduce
the computational cost of the system. A minimal set of fall specific features
are derived from the skeletal data, post observing the relative position of
human skeleton during fall. These features are shown to have different
distributions for Fall and non-fall scenarios proving their discriminative
capability. A Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) based network is selected and the
network architecture and training parameters are designed after evaluation of
performance on standard datasets. In the Pre-impact fall detection system the
computation requirement is about 18 times lesser than existing modules with a
comparable accuracy of 88%. Given the low computation requirements and higher
accuracy levels, the proposed system is suitable for wider adoption in
engineering systems related to industrial and residential safety.

Result: 在Waymo、KITTI和DL3DV数据集上，S3PO-GS在视图合成和跟踪精度上优于其他方法。

Conclusion: S3PO-GS在复杂户外环境中表现出色，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a popular solution in SLAM due to its
high-fidelity and real-time novel view synthesis performance. However, some
previous 3DGS SLAM methods employ a differentiable rendering pipeline for
tracking, \textbf{lack geometric priors} in outdoor scenes. Other approaches
introduce separate tracking modules, but they accumulate errors with
significant camera movement, leading to \textbf{scale drift}. To address these
challenges, we propose a robust RGB-only outdoor 3DGS SLAM method: S3PO-GS.
Technically, we establish a self-consistent tracking module anchored in the
3DGS pointmap, which avoids cumulative scale drift and achieves more precise
and robust tracking with fewer iterations. Additionally, we design a
patch-based pointmap dynamic mapping module, which introduces geometric priors
while avoiding scale ambiguity. This significantly enhances tracking accuracy
and the quality of scene reconstruction, making it particularly suitable for
complex outdoor environments. Our experiments on the Waymo, KITTI, and DL3DV
datasets demonstrate that S3PO-GS achieves state-of-the-art results in novel
view synthesis and outperforms other 3DGS SLAM methods in tracking accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continuous-time Consistency Models (CMs)在少步生成中表现高效，但训练不稳定。作者认为这种不稳定性源于模型仅学习概率流的捷径，而忽略了定义流的瞬时速度场。

Method: 提出FACM，通过Flow Matching任务作为锚点，辅助CM的捷径目标训练，无需修改模型架构。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256上，FACM以两步（NFE=2）和一步（NFE=1）分别达到1.32和1.76的FID，显著优于先前方法。

Conclusion: FACM为构建高性能少步生成模型提供了一种通用且有效的方案。

Abstract: Continuous-time Consistency Models (CMs) promise efficient few-step
generation but face significant challenges with training instability. We argue
this instability stems from a fundamental conflict: by training a network to
learn only a shortcut across a probability flow, the model loses its grasp on
the instantaneous velocity field that defines the flow. Our solution is to
explicitly anchor the model in the underlying flow during training. We
introduce the Flow-Anchored Consistency Model (FACM), a simple but effective
training strategy that uses a Flow Matching (FM) task as an anchor for the
primary CM shortcut objective. This Flow-Anchoring approach requires no
architectural modifications and is broadly compatible with standard model
architectures. By distilling a pre-trained LightningDiT model, our method
achieves a state-of-the-art FID of 1.32 with two steps (NFE=2) and 1.76 with
just one step (NFE=1) on ImageNet 256x256, significantly outperforming previous
methods. This provides a general and effective recipe for building

Abstract: The global demand for radiologists is increasing rapidly due to a growing
reliance on medical imaging services, while the supply of radiologists is not
keeping pace. Advances in computer vision and image processing technologies
present significant potential to address this gap by enhancing radiologists'
capabilities and improving diagnostic accuracy. Large language models (LLMs),
particularly generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs), have become the
primary approach for understanding and generating textual data. In parallel,
vision transformers (ViTs) have proven effective at converting visual data into
a format that LLMs can process efficiently. In this paper, we present ChestGPT,
a deep-learning framework that integrates the EVA ViT with the Llama 2 LLM to
classify diseases and localize regions of interest in chest X-ray images. The
ViT converts X-ray images into tokens, which are then fed, together with
engineered prompts, into the LLM, enabling joint classification and
localization of diseases. This approach incorporates transfer learning
techniques to enhance both explainability and performance. The proposed method
achieved strong global disease classification performance on the VinDr-CXR
dataset, with an F1 score of 0.76, and successfully localized pathologies by
generating bounding boxes around the regions of interest. We also outline
several task-specific prompts, in addition to general-purpose prompts, for
scenarios radiologists might encounter. Overall, this framework offers an
assistive tool that can lighten radiologists' workload by providing preliminary
findings and regions of interest to facilitate their diagnostic process.

Abstract: Recently, great progress has been achieved in text-to-video (T2V) generation
by scaling transformer-based diffusion models to billions of parameters, which
can generate high-quality videos. However, existing models typically produce
only short clips offline, restricting their use cases in interactive and
real-time applications. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing
StreamDiT, a streaming video generation model. StreamDiT training is based on
flow matching by adding a moving buffer. We design mixed training with
different partitioning schemes of buffered frames to boost both content
consistency and visual quality. StreamDiT modeling is based on adaLN DiT with
varying time embedding and window attention. To practice the proposed method,
we train a StreamDiT model with 4B parameters. In addition, we propose a
multistep distillation method tailored for StreamDiT. Sampling distillation is
performed in each segment of a chosen partitioning scheme. After distillation,
the total number of function evaluations (NFEs) is reduced to the number of
chunks in a buffer. Finally, our distilled model reaches real-time performance
at 16 FPS on one GPU, which can generate video streams at 512p resolution. We
evaluate our method through both quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Our
model enables real-time applications, e.g. streaming generation, interactive
generation, and video-to-video. We provide video results and more examples in

Conclusion: 该框架高效利用了事件与帧数据的互补信息，显著提升了语义分割性能并降低了能耗。

Abstract: Event cameras have recently been introduced into image semantic segmentation,
owing to their high temporal resolution and other advantageous properties.
However, existing event-based semantic segmentation methods often fail to fully
exploit the complementary information provided by frames and events, resulting
in complex training strategies and increased computational costs. To address
these challenges, we propose an efficient hybrid framework for image semantic
segmentation, comprising a Spiking Neural Network branch for events and an
Artificial Neural Network branch for frames. Specifically, we introduce three
specialized modules to facilitate the interaction between these two branches:
the Adaptive Temporal Weighting (ATW) Injector, the Event-Driven Sparse (EDS)
Injector, and the Channel Selection Fusion (CSF) module. The ATW Injector
dynamically integrates temporal features from event data into frame features,
enhancing segmentation accuracy by leveraging critical dynamic temporal

frame features, ensuring precise temporal and spatial information alignment.
The CSF module selectively merges these features to optimize segmentation
performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework not only
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across the DDD17-Seg, DSEC-Semantic, and
M3ED-Semantic datasets but also significantly reduces energy consumption,
achieving a 65\% reduction on the DSEC-Semantic dataset.

*Jiaqi Zhang,Juntuo Wang,Zhixin Sun,John Zou,Randall Balestriero*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的DINOv2预训练策略，通过频率过滤课程和高斯噪声补丁增强，加速收敛并增强鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模视觉基础模型（如DINOv2）需要大量计算资源，限制了其在私有数据、新模态或科学探索中的应用。

Method: 采用频率过滤课程（低频优先）和高斯噪声补丁增强技术。

Result: 在ViT-B/16上，预训练时间和FLOPs分别减少1.6倍和2.25倍，同时在ImageNet-C上保持鲁棒性，线性探测性能与基线相当。

Conclusion: 该方法在效率和鲁棒性上取得双重优势，为大规模自监督基础模型提供了更可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale vision foundation models such as DINOv2 boast impressive
performances by leveraging massive architectures and training datasets. But
numerous scenarios require practitioners to reproduce those pre-training
solutions, such as on private data, new modalities, or simply for scientific
questioning--which is currently extremely demanding computation-wise. We thus
propose a novel pre-training strategy for DINOv2 that simultaneously
accelerates convergence--and strengthens robustness to common corruptions as a
by-product. Our approach involves a frequency filtering
curriculum--low-frequency being seen first--and the Gaussian noise patching
augmentation. Applied to a ViT-B/16 backbone trained on ImageNet-1K, while
pre-training time and FLOPs are reduced by 1.6x and 2.25x, our method still
achieves matching robustness in corruption benchmarks (ImageNet-C) and
maintains competitive linear probing performance compared with baseline. This
dual benefit of efficiency and robustness makes large-scale self-supervised
foundation modeling more attainable, while opening the door to novel
exploration around data curriculum and augmentation as means to improve
self-supervised learning models robustness. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着ViT在安全关键应用中的普及，确保其在比特翻转故障下的正确功能变得至关重要。

Method: 利用参数的最低位不关键的特性，将其替换为奇偶校验位以实现故障检测，检测到故障时通过零掩码处理受影响参数。

Result: 该方法显著提升了ViT模型的可靠性，对比特翻转的鲁棒性提高了三个数量级。

Conclusion: 该技术为零开销的容错解决方案，适用于关键应用中的ViT模型。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated superior performance over
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in various vision-related tasks such as
classification, object detection, and segmentation due to their use of
self-attention mechanisms. As ViTs become more popular in safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, ensuring their correct functionality
becomes essential, especially in the presence of bit-flip faults in their
parameters stored in memory. In this paper, a fault tolerance technique is
introduced to protect ViT parameters against bit-flip faults with zero memory
overhead. Since the least significant bits of parameters are not critical for
model accuracy, replacing the LSB with a parity bit provides an error detection
mechanism without imposing any overhead on the model. When faults are detected,
affected parameters are masked by zeroing out, as most parameters in ViT models
are near zero, effectively preventing accuracy degradation. This approach
enhances reliability across ViT models, improving the robustness of parameters
to bit-flips by up to three orders of magnitude, making it an effective
zero-overhead solution for fault tolerance in critical applications.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型难以准确反映提示词的所有语义信息，且缺乏自动检测失败的能力。

Method: 采用B-cos模块构建扩散模型，通过解释性分析揭示每个提示词对图像像素区域的影响。

Result: B-cos扩散模型能生成高质量图像，并提供提示词与图像对齐的有意义解释。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持图像生成质量的同时，增强了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models generate images by iteratively denoising
random noise, conditioned on a prompt. While these models have enabled
impressive progress in image generation, they often fail to accurately reflect
all semantic information described in the prompt -- failures that are difficult
to detect automatically. In this work, we introduce a diffusion model
architecture built with B-cos modules that offers inherent interpretability.
Our approach provides insight into how individual prompt tokens affect the
generated image by producing explanations that highlight the pixel regions
influenced by each token. We demonstrate that B-cos diffusion models can
produce high-quality images while providing meaningful insights into
prompt-image alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在动态城市环境建模中，虽能实现高保真重建和实时渲染，但忽略了帧间和视角间的细粒度变化，导致结果不理想。

Method: 采用多级外观建模方案，优化复合高斯的变换参数，从局部高斯级到全局图像级和动态角色级进行多粒度细化。

Result: 在多个自动驾驶数据集（Waymo、KITTI、NOTR、VKITTI2）上验证了方法的优越性。

Conclusion: ArmGS方法在动态场景建模中表现出色，优于现有技术。

Abstract: This work focuses on modeling dynamic urban environments for autonomous
driving simulation. Contemporary data-driven methods using neural radiance
fields have achieved photorealistic driving scene modeling, but they suffer
from low rendering efficacy. Recently, some approaches have explored 3D
Gaussian splatting for modeling dynamic urban scenes, enabling high-fidelity
reconstruction and real-time rendering. However, these approaches often neglect
to model fine-grained variations between frames and camera viewpoints, leading
to suboptimal results. In this work, we propose a new approach named ArmGS that
exploits composite driving Gaussian splatting with multi-granularity appearance
refinement for autonomous driving scene modeling. The core idea of our approach
is devising a multi-level appearance modeling scheme to optimize a set of
transformation parameters for composite Gaussian refinement from multiple
granularities, ranging from local Gaussian level to global image level and
dynamic actor level. This not only models global scene appearance variations
between frames and camera viewpoints, but also models local fine-grained
changes of background and objects. Extensive experiments on multiple
challenging autonomous driving datasets, namely, Waymo, KITTI, NOTR and
VKITTI2, demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art
methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种层次化语义-视觉融合（HSVF）框架，用于解决长距离雾霾去除问题，通过结合近红外和可见光模态，实现高对比度场景和丰富纹理细节的恢复。


<details>

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注短距离雾霾去除，长距离雾霾因散射增强和信号损失而难以处理。近红外模态具有更好的雾穿透能力，但现有方法在融合时忽略了可见光图像中的雾霾残留。

Method: 提出HSVF框架，包含语义流和视觉流。语义流通过对齐模态不变的内在表示获取抗雾霾语义预测，视觉流则从近红外模态恢复丢失的结构细节。

Result: 实验表明，HSVF在真实世界长距离雾霾去除任务中优于现有方法，能够恢复高对比度场景和丰富纹理细节。

Conclusion: HSVF框架通过双流协作，有效解决了长距离雾霾去除问题，并提出了新的数据集以支持未来研究。

Abstract: While image dehazing has advanced substantially in the past decade, most
efforts have focused on short-range scenarios, leaving long-range haze removal
under-explored. As distance increases, intensified scattering leads to severe
haze and signal loss, making it impractical to recover distant details solely
from visible images. Near-infrared, with superior fog penetration, offers
critical complementary cues through multimodal fusion. However, existing
methods focus on content integration while often neglecting haze embedded in
visible images, leading to results with residual haze. In this work, we argue
that the infrared and visible modalities not only provide complementary
low-level visual features, but also share high-level semantic consistency.
Motivated by this, we propose a Hierarchical Semantic-Visual Fusion (HSVF)
framework, comprising a semantic stream to reconstruct haze-free scenes and a
visual stream to incorporate structural details from the near-infrared
modality. The semantic stream first acquires haze-robust semantic prediction by
aligning modality-invariant intrinsic representations. Then the shared
semantics act as strong priors to restore clear and high-contrast distant
scenes under severe haze degradation. In parallel, the visual stream focuses on
recovering lost structural details from near-infrared by fusing complementary
cues from both visible and near-infrared images. Through the cooperation of
dual streams, HSVF produces results that exhibit both high-contrast scenes and
rich texture details. Moreover, we introduce a novel pixel-aligned
visible-infrared haze dataset with semantic labels to facilitate benchmarking.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over
state-of-the-art approaches in real-world long-range haze removal.

Result: 在多个HAR基准测试中，该方法显著优于11种现有基线方法，适用于跨人、跨数据集和跨位置场景。

Conclusion: 该方法通过因果机制有效提升了跨域活动识别的性能，具有高效性和普适性。

Abstract: Recently, domain generalization (DG) has emerged as a promising solution to
mitigate distribution-shift issue in sensor-based human activity recognition
(HAR) scenario. However, most existing DG-based works have merely focused on
modeling statistical dependence between sensor data and activity labels,
neglecting the importance of intrinsic casual mechanism. Intuitively, every
sensor input can be viewed as a mixture of causal (category-aware) and
non-causal factors (domain-specific), where only the former affects activity
classification judgment. In this paper, by casting such DG-based HAR as a
casual inference problem, we propose a causality-inspired representation
learning algorithm for cross-domain activity recognition. To this end, an
early-forking two-branch framework is designed, where two separate branches are
respectively responsible for learning casual and non-causal features, while an
independence-based Hilbert-Schmidt Information Criterion is employed to
implicitly disentangling them. Additionally, an inhomogeneous domain sampling
strategy is designed to enhance disentanglement, while a category-aware domain
perturbation layer is performed to prevent representation collapse. Extensive
experiments on several public HAR benchmarks demonstrate that our
causality-inspired approach significantly outperforms eleven related
state-of-the-art baselines under cross-person, cross-dataset, and
cross-position settings. Detailed ablation and visualizations analyses reveal
underlying casual mechanism, indicating its effectiveness, efficiency, and
universality in cross-domain activity recognition scenario.

Result: 在Real3D-AD和Anomaly-ShapeNet数据集上，Object-level AUROC分别达到79.9%和79.5%，Point-level AUROC为71.2%和84.7%。

Conclusion: DUS-Net通过保留几何结构和多尺度特征融合，有效提升了3D异常检测的性能。

Abstract: Reconstruction-based methods have demonstrated very promising results for 3D
anomaly detection. However, these methods face great challenges in handling
high-precision point clouds due to the large scale and complex structure. In
this study, a Down-Up Sampling Network (DUS-Net) is proposed to reconstruct
high-precision point clouds for 3D anomaly detection by preserving the group
center geometric structure. The DUS-Net first introduces a Noise Generation
module to generate noisy patches, which facilitates the diversity of training
data and strengthens the feature representation for reconstruction. Then, a
Down-sampling Network~(Down-Net) is developed to learn an anomaly-free center
point cloud from patches with noise injection. Subsequently, an Up-sampling
Network (Up-Net) is designed to reconstruct high-precision point clouds by
fusing multi-scale up-sampling features. Our method leverages group centers for
construction, enabling the preservation of geometric structure and providing a
more precise point cloud. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with an
Object-level AUROC of 79.9% and 79.5%, and a Point-level AUROC of 71.2% and
84.7% on the Real3D-AD and Anomaly-ShapeNet datasets, respectively.

Abstract: Human animation recently has advanced rapidly, achieving increasingly
realistic and vivid results, especially with the integration of large-scale
video generation models. However, the slow inference speed and high
computational cost of these large models bring significant challenges for
practical applications. Additionally, various tasks in human animation, such as
lip-syncing, audio-driven full-body animation, and video generation from start
and end frames, often require different specialized models. The introduction of
large video models has not alleviated this dilemma. This raises an important
question: Can we make human animation Faster, Higher in quality, Stronger in
generalization, and make various tasks Together in one model? To address this,
we dive into video generation models and discover that the devil lies in the
details: Inspired by MAE, we propose a novel unified Multi-Task paradigm for
human animation, treating diverse generation tasks as spatial-temporal local
reconstructions, requiring modifications only on the input side; Given the
interplay and division among multi-modal conditions including text, image, and
audio, we introduce a multi-modal decoupled cross-attention module to fuse
multi-modals in a divide-and-conquer manner; We propose a new SFT+Reward
alternating training paradigm, enabling the minimal model with 1.3B parameters
to achieve generation quality comparable to models with 10 times the parameters
count. Through these innovations, our work paves the way for efficient,
high-quality, and versatile digital human generation, addressing both
performance and practicality challenges in the field. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EchoMimicV3 outperforms existing models in both facial and
semi-body video generation, providing precise text-based control for creating
videos in a wide range of scenarios.

Motivation: 现有大型语言模型（LLM）在放射学报告生成中更注重语言流畅性而非临床有效性，且难以有效关联X光图像与文本。

Method: 采用最优传输（OT）对齐图像特征与报告中的疾病标签，设计对齐与微调模块，并引入疾病预测模块。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR和IU X-Ray数据集上，OTDRG在自然语言生成和临床效能指标上均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: OTDRG框架成功解决了跨模态对齐问题，生成的报告兼具语言流畅性和临床准确性。

Abstract: Radiology report generation represents a significant application within
medical AI, and has achieved impressive results. Concurrently, large language
models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains.
However, empirical validation indicates that general LLMs tend to focus more on
linguistic fluency rather than clinical effectiveness, and lack the ability to
effectively capture the relationship between X-ray images and their
corresponding texts, thus resulting in poor clinical practicability. To address
these challenges, we propose Optimal Transport-Driven Radiology Report
Generation (OTDRG), a novel framework that leverages Optimal Transport (OT) to
align image features with disease labels extracted from reports, effectively
bridging the cross-modal gap. The core component of OTDRG is Alignment \&
Fine-Tuning, where OT utilizes results from the encoding of label features and
image visual features to minimize cross-modal distances, then integrating image
and text features for LLMs fine-tuning. Additionally, we design a novel disease
prediction module to predict disease labels contained in X-ray images during
validation and testing. Evaluated on the MIMIC-CXR and IU X-Ray datasets, OTDRG
achieves state-of-the-art performance in both natural language generation (NLG)
and clinical efficacy (CE) metrics, delivering reports that are not only
linguistically coherent but also clinically accurate.

Abstract: Accurate gland segmentation in histopathology images is essential for cancer
diagnosis and prognosis. However, significant variability in Hematoxylin and
Eosin (H&E) staining and tissue morphology, combined with limited annotated
data, poses major challenges for automated segmentation. To address this, we
propose Color-Structure Dual-Student (CSDS), a novel semi-supervised
segmentation framework designed to learn disentangled representations of stain
appearance and tissue structure. CSDS comprises two specialized student
networks: one trained on stain-augmented inputs to model chromatic variation,
and the other on structure-augmented inputs to capture morphological cues. A
shared teacher network, updated via Exponential Moving Average (EMA),
supervises both students through pseudo-labels. To further improve label
reliability, we introduce stain-aware and structure-aware uncertainty
estimation modules that adaptively modulate the contribution of each student
during training. Experiments on the GlaS and CRAG datasets show that CSDS
achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-label settings, with Dice score
improvements of up to 1.2% on GlaS and 0.7% on CRAG at 5% labeled data, and
0.7% and 1.4% at 10%. Our code and pre-trained models are available at

Conclusion: DNF-Intrinsic通过改进输入和约束机制，显著提升了逆渲染的质量和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent methods have shown that pre-trained diffusion models can be fine-tuned
to enable generative inverse rendering by learning image-conditioned
noise-to-intrinsic mapping. Despite their remarkable progress, they struggle to
robustly produce high-quality results as the noise-to-intrinsic paradigm
essentially utilizes noisy images with deteriorated structure and appearance
for intrinsic prediction, while it is common knowledge that structure and
appearance information in an image are crucial for inverse rendering. To
address this issue, we present DNF-Intrinsic, a robust yet efficient inverse
rendering approach fine-tuned from a pre-trained diffusion model, where we
propose to take the source image rather than Gaussian noise as input to
directly predict deterministic intrinsic properties via flow matching.
Moreover, we design a generative renderer to constrain that the predicted
intrinsic properties are physically faithful to the source image. Experiments
on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method clearly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Most GCN-based methods model interacting individuals as independent graphs,
neglecting their inherent inter-dependencies. Although recent approaches
utilize predefined interaction adjacency matrices to integrate participants,
these matrices fail to adaptively capture the dynamic and context-specific
joint interactions across different actions. In this paper, we propose the
Active Node Selection with External Attention Network (ASEA), an innovative
approach that dynamically captures interaction relationships without predefined
assumptions. Our method models each participant individually using a GCN to
capture intra-personal relationships, facilitating a detailed representation of
their actions. To identify the most relevant nodes for interaction modeling, we
introduce the Adaptive Temporal Node Amplitude Calculation (AT-NAC) module,
which estimates global node activity by combining spatial motion magnitude with
adaptive temporal weighting, thereby highlighting salient motion patterns while
reducing irrelevant or redundant information. A learnable threshold,
regularized to prevent extreme variations, is defined to selectively identify
the most informative nodes for interaction modeling. To capture interactions,
we design the External Attention (EA) module to operate on active nodes,
effectively modeling the interaction dynamics and semantic relationships
between individuals. Extensive evaluations show that our method captures
interaction relationships more effectively and flexibly, achieving
state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Synthesizing normal-light novel views from low-light multiview images is an
important yet challenging task, given the low visibility and high ISO noise
present in the input images. Existing low-light enhancement methods often
struggle to effectively preprocess such low-light inputs, as they fail to
consider correlations among multiple views. Although other state-of-the-art
methods have introduced illumination-related components offering alternative
solutions to the problem, they often result in drawbacks such as color
distortions and artifacts, and they provide limited denoising effectiveness. In
this paper, we propose a novel Robust Low-light Scene Restoration framework
(RoSe), which enables effective synthesis of novel views in normal lighting
conditions from low-light multiview image inputs, by formulating the task as an
illuminance transition estimation problem in 3D space, conceptualizing it as a
specialized rendering task. This multiview-consistent illuminance transition
field establishes a robust connection between low-light and normal-light
conditions. By further exploiting the inherent low-rank property of
illumination to constrain the transition representation, we achieve more
effective denoising without complex 2D techniques or explicit noise modeling.
To implement RoSe, we design a concise dual-branch architecture and introduce a
low-rank denoising module. Experiments demonstrate that RoSe significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art models in both rendering quality and multiview
consistency on standard benchmarks. The codes and data are available at

Result: 实验表明，Flux-Sculptor在丰富属性编辑和面部信息保留方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Flux-Sculptor是一个实用的肖像编辑框架，具有高保真和灵活性。

Abstract: Text-driven portrait editing holds significant potential for various
applications but also presents considerable challenges. An ideal text-driven
portrait editing approach should achieve precise localization and appropriate
content modification, yet existing methods struggle to balance reconstruction
fidelity and editing flexibility. To address this issue, we propose
Flux-Sculptor, a flux-based framework designed for precise text-driven portrait
editing. Our framework introduces a Prompt-Aligned Spatial Locator (PASL) to
accurately identify relevant editing regions and a Structure-to-Detail Edit
Control (S2D-EC) strategy to spatially guide the denoising process through
sequential mask-guided fusion of latent representations and attention values.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Flux-Sculptor surpasses existing methods
in rich-attribute editing and facial information preservation, making it a
strong candidate for practical portrait editing applications. Project page is

*Jeonghyo Song,Kimin Yun,DaeUng Jo,Jinyoung Kim,Youngjoon Yoo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Chain-of-Thought (CoT)的新框架，用于复杂道路场景中的OOD检测，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前OOD语义分割方法在密集重叠物体、远距离小物体和大前景物体等场景中的不足。

Method: 利用GPT-4等基础模型的知识和推理能力，通过CoT提示增强图像理解和推理。

Result: 在标准基准和新定义的RoadAnomaly子集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提供了一种鲁棒且可解释的OOD语义分割解决方案。

Abstract: Effective Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is criti-cal for ensuring the
reliability of semantic segmentation models, particularly in complex road
environments where safety and accuracy are paramount. Despite recent
advancements in large language models (LLMs), notably GPT-4, which
significantly enhanced multimodal reasoning through Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting, the application of CoT-based visual reasoning for OOD semantic
segmentation remains largely unexplored. In this paper, through extensive
analyses of the road scene anomalies, we identify three challenging scenarios
where current state-of-the-art OOD segmentation methods consistently struggle:
(1) densely packed and overlapping objects, (2) distant scenes with small
objects, and (3) large foreground-dominant objects. To address the presented
challenges, we propose a novel CoT-based framework targeting OOD detection in
road anomaly scenes. Our method leverages the extensive knowledge and reasoning
capabilities of foundation models, such as GPT-4, to enhance OOD detection
through improved image understanding and prompt-based reasoning aligned with
observed problematic scene attributes. Extensive experiments show that our
framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both standard
benchmarks and our newly defined challenging subset of the RoadAnomaly dataset,
offering a robust and interpretable solution for OOD semantic segmentation in
complex driving environments.

Result: 现有VQA指标在RDAE上表现较差，相关性较低，凸显数据集挑战性。

Conclusion: LEHA-CVQAD数据集和RDAE指标为压缩视频质量评估提供了新工具和基准。

Abstract: We propose the LEHA-CVQAD (Large-scale Enriched Human-Annotated) dataset,
which comprises 6,240 clips for compression-oriented video quality assessment.
59 source videos are encoded with 186 codec-preset variants, 1.8M pairwise, and
1.5k MOS ratings are fused into a single quality scale; part of the videos
remains hidden for blind evaluation. We also propose Rate-Distortion Alignment
Error (RDAE), a novel evaluation metric that quantifies how well VQA models
preserve bitrate-quality ordering, directly supporting codec parameter tuning.
Testing IQA/VQA methods reveals that popular VQA metrics exhibit high RDAE and
lower correlations, underscoring the dataset challenges and utility. The open

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的DGFAS框架，通过FOD和GS-RM联合对齐权重和偏置，解决了现有方法中偏置项未对齐的问题，提升了跨域泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DGFAS方法仅对齐局部决策边界的权重，而偏置项未对齐导致分类阈值不一致，影响性能。

Method: 采用FOD显式分解特征空间为域不变和域特定子空间，并通过GS-RM平衡多域损失以对齐偏置项。

Result: 在基准数据集上实现了最优性能，提高了准确率、减少了偏置未对齐，并增强了泛化稳定性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了偏置未对齐问题，显著提升了跨域泛化能力。

Abstract: Domain Generalizable Face Anti-Spoofing (DGFAS) methods effectively capture
domain-invariant features by aligning the directions (weights) of local
decision boundaries across domains. However, the bias terms associated with
these boundaries remain misaligned, leading to inconsistent classification
thresholds and degraded performance on unseen target domains. To address this
issue, we propose a novel DGFAS framework that jointly aligns weights and
biases through Feature Orthogonal Decomposition (FOD) and Group-wise Scaling
Risk Minimization (GS-RM). Specifically, GS-RM facilitates bias alignment by
balancing group-wise losses across multiple domains. FOD employs the
Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process to decompose the feature space
explicitly into domain-invariant and domain-specific subspaces. By enforcing
orthogonality between domain-specific and domain-invariant features during
training using domain labels, FOD ensures effective weight alignment across
domains without negatively impacting bias alignment. Additionally, we introduce
Expected Calibration Error (ECE) as a novel evaluation metric for
quantitatively assessing the effectiveness of our method in aligning bias terms
across domains. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently improving
accuracy, reducing bias misalignment, and enhancing generalization stability on
unseen target domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生境评估依赖专家调查，成本高且效率低，AI驱动的自动化工具可降低成本并提高精度。

Method: 使用CNN和ViT模型，结合监督和监督对比学习范式，对英国乡村调查的18种生境类型进行分类。

Result: ViT在分类指标上优于CNN（Top-3准确率91%，MCC=0.66），监督对比学习显著减少相似生境的误分类。

Conclusion: 结合AI与生态学专业知识，该研究为地面级生境监测提供了可扩展、经济高效的框架，有助于生物多样性保护和土地利用决策。

Abstract: Habitat assessment at local scales -- critical for enhancing biodiversity and
guiding conservation priorities -- often relies on expert field survey that can
be costly, motivating the exploration of AI-driven tools to automate and refine
this process. While most AI-driven habitat mapping depends on remote sensing,
it is often constrained by sensor availability, weather, and coarse resolution.
In contrast, ground-level imagery captures essential structural and
compositional cues invisible from above and remains underexplored for robust,
fine-grained habitat classification. This study addresses this gap by applying
state-of-the-art deep neural network architectures to ground-level habitat
imagery. Leveraging data from the UK Countryside Survey covering 18 broad
habitat types, we evaluate two families of models -- convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) -- under both supervised and
supervised contrastive learning paradigms. Our results demonstrate that ViTs
consistently outperform state-of-the-art CNN baselines on key classification
metrics (Top-3 accuracy = 91\%, MCC = 0.66) and offer more interpretable scene
understanding tailored to ground-level images. Moreover, supervised contrastive
learning significantly reduces misclassification rates among visually similar
habitats (e.g., Improved vs. Neutral Grassland), driven by a more
discriminative embedding space. Finally, our best model performs on par with
experienced ecological experts in habitat classification from images,
underscoring the promise of expert-level automated assessment. By integrating
advanced AI with ecological expertise, this research establishes a scalable,
cost-effective framework for ground-level habitat monitoring to accelerate
biodiversity conservation and inform land-use decisions at the national scale.

TL;DR: 该研究提出用Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) 替代ViTs中的MLPs，以解决持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题。实验表明，KAN-based ViTs在知识保留和任务适应上优于传统MLP-based ViTs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习（CL）中，灾难性遗忘是ViTs使用MLPs进行全局表示学习时的关键挑战。

Method: 用KANs替代ViTs中的MLPs，利用基于样条的激活实现局部可塑性，仅更新部分参数以保留旧知识。

Result: KAN-based ViTs在MNIST和CIFAR100等基准数据集上显著减轻灾难性遗忘，表现优于传统MLP-based ViTs。

Conclusion: KANs与ViTs的结合为动态环境中的鲁棒和适应性模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL), the ability of a model to learn new tasks without
forgetting previously acquired knowledge, remains a critical challenge in
artificial intelligence, particularly for vision transformers (ViTs) utilizing
Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) for global representation learning. Catastrophic
forgetting, where new information overwrites prior knowledge, is especially
problematic in these models. This research proposes replacing MLPs in ViTs with
Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KANs) to address this issue. KANs leverage local
plasticity through spline-based activations, ensuring that only a subset of
parameters is updated per sample, thereby preserving previously learned
knowledge. The study investigates the efficacy of KAN-based ViTs in CL
scenarios across benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR100), focusing on their
ability to retain accuracy on earlier tasks while adapting to new ones.
Experimental results demonstrate that KAN-based ViTs significantly mitigate
catastrophic forgetting, outperforming traditional MLP-based ViTs in knowledge
retention and task adaptation. This novel integration of KANs into ViTs
represents a promising step toward more robust and adaptable models for dynamic
environments.

Result: 在30对文档-演示数据上，PresentAgent接近人类水平。

Conclusion: 可控多模态代理在动态演示转换中潜力巨大。

Abstract: We present PresentAgent, a multimodal agent that transforms long-form
documents into narrated presentation videos. While existing approaches are
limited to generating static slides or text summaries, our method advances
beyond these limitations by producing fully synchronized visual and spoken
content that closely mimics human-style presentations. To achieve this
integration, PresentAgent employs a modular pipeline that systematically
segments the input document, plans and renders slide-style visual frames,
generates contextual spoken narration with large language models and
Text-to-Speech models, and seamlessly composes the final video with precise
audio-visual alignment. Given the complexity of evaluating such multimodal
outputs, we introduce PresentEval, a unified assessment framework powered by
Vision-Language Models that comprehensively scores videos across three critical
dimensions: content fidelity, visual clarity, and audience comprehension
through prompt-based evaluation. Our experimental validation on a curated
dataset of 30 document-presentation pairs demonstrates that PresentAgent
approaches human-level quality across all evaluation metrics. These results
highlight the significant potential of controllable multimodal agents in
transforming static textual materials into dynamic, effective, and accessible
presentation formats. Code will be available at

physics simulations to generate synthetic images with pixel-level segmentation
annotations, which are notoriously difficult to obtain. Specifically, we apply
this approach to breast imaging analysis and release T-SYNTH, a large-scale
open-source dataset of paired 2D digital mammography (DM) and 3D digital breast
tomosynthesis (DBT) images. Our initial experimental results indicate that
T-SYNTH images show promise for augmenting limited real patient datasets for

Motivation: 现有3D视觉语言模型仅关注静态观察中的对象定位，缺乏主动感知和探索能力，限制了智能体在真实环境中的理解能力。

Conclusion: MTU3D的成功表明，结合视觉定位与探索对实现智能体的环境理解至关重要。

Abstract: Embodied scene understanding requires not only comprehending visual-spatial
information that has been observed but also determining where to explore next
in the 3D physical world. Existing 3D Vision-Language (3D-VL) models primarily
focus on grounding objects in static observations from 3D reconstruction, such
as meshes and point clouds, but lack the ability to actively perceive and
explore their environment. To address this limitation, we introduce
\underline{\textbf{M}}ove \underline{\textbf{t}}o
\underline{\textbf{U}}nderstand (\textbf{\model}), a unified framework that
integrates active perception with \underline{\textbf{3D}} vision-language
learning, enabling embodied agents to effectively explore and understand their
environment. This is achieved by three key innovations: 1) Online query-based
representation learning, enabling direct spatial memory construction from RGB-D
frames, eliminating the need for explicit 3D reconstruction. 2) A unified
objective for grounding and exploring, which represents unexplored locations as
frontier queries and jointly optimizes object grounding and frontier selection.
3) End-to-end trajectory learning that combines
\textbf{V}ision-\textbf{L}anguage-\textbf{E}xploration pre-training over a
million diverse trajectories collected from both simulated and real-world RGB-D
sequences. Extensive evaluations across various embodied navigation and
question-answering benchmarks show that MTU3D outperforms state-of-the-art
reinforcement learning and modular navigation approaches by 14\%, 23\%, 9\%,
and 2\% in success rate on HM3D-OVON, GOAT-Bench, SG3D, and A-EQA,
respectively. \model's versatility enables navigation using diverse input
modalities, including categories, language descriptions, and reference images.
These findings highlight the importance of bridging visual grounding and
exploration for embodied intelligence.

Result: 在六个细粒度数据集上实验证明DiffGRE优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DiffGRE通过合成数据和多阶段方法有效提升了OCD任务的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a practical yet challenging task: On-the-fly
Category Discovery (OCD). This task focuses on the online identification of
newly arriving stream data that may belong to both known and unknown
categories, utilizing the category knowledge from only labeled data. Existing
OCD methods are devoted to fully mining transferable knowledge from only
labeled data. However, the transferability learned by these methods is limited
because the knowledge contained in known categories is often insufficient,
especially when few annotated data/categories are available in fine-grained
recognition. To mitigate this limitation, we propose a diffusion-based OCD
framework, dubbed DiffGRE, which integrates Generation, Refinement, and
Encoding in a multi-stage fashion. Specifically, we first design an
attribute-composition generation method based on cross-image interpolation in
the diffusion latent space to synthesize novel samples. Then, we propose a
diversity-driven refinement approach to select the synthesized images that
differ from known categories for subsequent OCD model training. Finally, we
leverage a semi-supervised leader encoding to inject additional category
knowledge contained in synthesized data into the OCD models, which can benefit
the discovery of both known and unknown categories during the on-the-fly
inference process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our
DiffGRE over previous methods on six fine-grained datasets.

Result: 在四个HMP基准数据集上的实验验证了TCL的有效性和灵活性。

Conclusion: TCL框架能轻松集成到不同HMP模型中，适用于多种数据集和应用。

Abstract: Human Motion Prediction (HMP) aims to predict future poses at different
moments according to past motion sequences. Previous approaches have treated
the prediction of various moments equally, resulting in two main limitations:
the learning of short-term predictions is hindered by the focus on long-term
predictions, and the incorporation of prior information from past predictions
into subsequent predictions is limited. In this paper, we introduce a novel
multi-stage training framework called Temporal Continual Learning (TCL) to
address the above challenges. To better preserve prior information, we
introduce the Prior Compensation Factor (PCF). We incorporate it into the model
training to compensate for the lost prior information. Furthermore, we derive a
more reasonable optimization objective through theoretical derivation. It is
important to note that our TCL framework can be easily integrated with
different HMP backbone models and adapted to various datasets and applications.
Extensive experiments on four HMP benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness and flexibility of TCL. The code is available at

Conclusion: DOCTOR模型通过多模态一致性学习和领域不变特征提取，有效提升短视频虚假信息检测的泛化能力。

Abstract: Short-video misinformation detection has attracted wide attention in the
multi-modal domain, aiming to accurately identify the misinformation in the
video format accompanied by the corresponding audio. Despite significant
advancements, current models in this field, trained on particular domains
(source domains), often exhibit unsatisfactory performance on unseen domains
(target domains) due to domain gaps. To effectively realize such domain
generalization on the short-video misinformation detection task, we propose
deep insights into the characteristics of different domains: (1) The detection
on various domains may mainly rely on different modalities (i.e., mainly
focusing on videos or audios). To enhance domain generalization, it is crucial
to achieve optimal model performance on all modalities simultaneously. (2) For
some domains focusing on cross-modal joint fraud, a comprehensive analysis
relying on cross-modal fusion is necessary. However, domain biases located in
each modality (especially in each frame of videos) will be accumulated in this
fusion process, which may seriously damage the final identification of
misinformation. To address these issues, we propose a new DOmain generalization
model via ConsisTency and invariance learning for shORt-video misinformation
detection (named DOCTOR), which contains two characteristic modules: (1) We
involve the cross-modal feature interpolation to map multiple modalities into a
shared space and the interpolation distillation to synchronize multi-modal
learning; (2) We design the diffusion model to add noise to retain core
features of multi modal and enhance domain invariant features through
cross-modal guided denoising. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed DOCTOR model. Our code is public available at

Result: 在四个运动预测数据集上表现优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: STAB和ACB结合AAA策略有效解决了目标问题，提升了预测的合理性和一致性。

Abstract: Action-driven stochastic human motion prediction aims to generate future
motion sequences of a pre-defined target action based on given past observed
sequences performing non-target actions. This task primarily presents two
challenges. Firstly, generating smooth transition motions is hard due to the
varying transition speeds of different actions. Secondly, the action
characteristic is difficult to be learned because of the similarity of some
actions. These issues cause the predicted results to be unreasonable and
inconsistent. As a result, we propose two memory banks, the Soft-transition
Action Bank (STAB) and Action Characteristic Bank (ACB), to tackle the problems
above. The STAB stores the action transition information. It is equipped with
the novel soft searching approach, which encourages the model to focus on
multiple possible action categories of observed motions. The ACB records action
characteristic, which produces more prior information for predicting certain
actions. To fuse the features retrieved from the two banks better, we further
propose the Adaptive Attention Adjustment (AAA) strategy. Extensive experiments
on four motion prediction datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently
outperforms the previous state-of-the-art. The demo and code are available at

Abstract: In this paper, we present a high-performing solution to the UAVM 2025
Challenge, which focuses on matching narrow FOV street-level images to
corresponding satellite imagery using the University-1652 dataset. As panoramic
Cross-View Geo-Localisation nears peak performance, it becomes increasingly
important to explore more practical problem formulations. Real-world scenarios
rarely offer panoramic street-level queries; instead, queries typically consist
of limited-FOV images captured with unknown camera parameters. Our work
prioritises discovering the highest achievable performance under these
constraints, pushing the limits of existing architectures. Our method begins by
retrieving candidate satellite image embeddings for a given query, followed by
a re-ranking stage that selectively enhances retrieval accuracy within the top
candidates. This two-stage approach enables more precise matching, even under
the significant viewpoint and scale variations inherent in the task. Through
experimentation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive results
-specifically attaining R@1 and R@10 retrieval rates of \topone\% and \topten\%
respectively. This underscores the potential of optimised retrieval and
re-ranking strategies in advancing practical geo-localisation performance. Code

Conclusion: GaPP-Class和GaPP-ReaCtion是高效、鲁棒的自适应跟踪器，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: This paper presents a computationally efficient multi-object tracking
approach that can minimise track breaks (e.g., in challenging environments and
against agile targets), learn the measurement model parameters on-line (e.g.,
in dynamically changing scenes) and infer the class of the tracked objects, if
joint tracking and kinematic behaviour classification is sought. It capitalises
on the flexibilities offered by the integrated Gaussian process as a motion
model and the convenient statistical properties of non-homogeneous Poisson
processes as a suitable observation model. This can be combined with the
proposed effective track revival / stitching mechanism. We accordingly
introduce the two robust and adaptive trackers, Gaussian and Poisson Process
with Classification (GaPP-Class) and GaPP with Revival and Classification
(GaPP-ReaCtion). They employ an appropriate particle filtering inference scheme
that efficiently integrates track management and hyperparameter learning
(including the object class, if relevant). GaPP-ReaCtion extends GaPP-Class
with the addition of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo kernel applied to each particle
permitting track revival and stitching (e.g., within a few time steps after
deleting a trajectory). Performance evaluation and benchmarking using synthetic
and real data show that GaPP-Class and GaPP-ReaCtion outperform other
state-of-the-art tracking algorithms. For example, GaPP-ReaCtion significantly
reduces track breaks (e.g., by around 30% from real radar data and markedly
more from simulated data).

TL;DR: PromptSR提出了一种基于提示的轻量级图像超分辨率方法，通过级联提示块（CPB）结合全局和局部信息，显著扩大感受野并保持低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于窗口的自注意力模型在轻量级Vision Transformer中感受野受限的问题，同时保持低计算成本。

Method: 提出CPB模块，包含全局锚点提示层（GAPL）和两个局部提示层（LPLs），通过跨尺度注意力构建低维锚点提示，并结合类别和窗口自注意力进行细粒度优化。

Result: 实验表明，PromptSR在定量、定性和复杂度评估上优于现有轻量级超分辨率方法。

Conclusion: PromptSR通过结合全局先验和局部细节，有效扩大了感受野，同时保持了低计算成本，为轻量级图像超分辨率提供了新思路。

Abstract: Although the lightweight Vision Transformer has significantly advanced image
super-resolution (SR), it faces the inherent challenge of a limited receptive
field due to the window-based self-attention modeling. The quadratic
computational complexity relative to window size restricts its ability to use a
large window size for expanding the receptive field while maintaining low
computational costs. To address this challenge, we propose PromptSR, a novel
prompt-empowered lightweight image SR method. The core component is the
proposed cascade prompting block (CPB), which enhances global information
access and local refinement via three cascaded prompting layers: a global
anchor prompting layer (GAPL) and two local prompting layers (LPLs). The GAPL
leverages downscaled features as anchors to construct low-dimensional anchor
prompts (APs) through cross-scale attention, significantly reducing
computational costs. These APs, with enhanced global perception, are then used
to provide global prompts, efficiently facilitating long-range token
connections. The two LPLs subsequently combine category-based self-attention
and window-based self-attention to refine the representation in a
coarse-to-fine manner. They leverage attention maps from the GAPL as additional
global prompts, enabling them to perceive features globally at different
granularities for adaptive local refinement. In this way, the proposed CPB
effectively combines global priors and local details, significantly enlarging
the receptive field while maintaining the low computational costs of our
PromptSR. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method,
which outperforms state-of-the-art lightweight SR methods in quantitative,
qualitative, and complexity evaluations. Our code will be released at
https://github.com/wenyang001/PromptSR.

Abstract: This paper presents Edge-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) Collaborative
Computing (EMC2), an optimal computing system designed for autonomous vehicles
(AVs) that simultaneously achieves low-latency and high-accuracy 3D object
detection. Unlike conventional approaches, EMC2 incorporates a scenario-aware
MoE architecture specifically optimized for edge platforms. By effectively
fusing LiDAR and camera data, the system leverages the complementary strengths

representations. To enable this, EMC2 employs an adaptive multimodal data
bridge that performs multi-scale preprocessing on sensor inputs, followed by a
scenario-aware routing mechanism that dynamically dispatches features to
dedicated expert models based on object visibility and distance. In addition,
EMC2 integrates joint hardware-software optimizations, including hardware
resource utilization optimization and computational graph simplification, to
ensure efficient and real-time inference on resource-constrained edge devices.
Experiments on open-source benchmarks clearly show the EMC2 advancements as a
end-to-end system. On the KITTI dataset, it achieves an average accuracy
improvement of 3.58% and a 159.06% inference speedup compared to 15 baseline

TL;DR: Hi-SSLVLM是一种新型生成模型，通过两阶段自监督学习策略提升复杂文本到图像合成的性能，显著优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法依赖昂贵标注数据和难以控制细粒度视觉属性及空间关系的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段策略：多粒度视觉-语言对齐和自细化引导图像生成，结合内部组合规划机制和语义一致性损失。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优于主流模型，人类评估也证实其生成质量更高。

Conclusion: Hi-SSLVLM为可控且语义一致的文本到图像生成提供了重要进展。

Abstract: This paper introduces Hierarchical Self-Supervised LVLM (Hi-SSLVLM), a novel
generative model designed to significantly advance text-to-image synthesis,
particularly for complex and compositionally challenging prompts. Traditional
methods often grapple with the high cost of meticulously curated paired
image-text datasets and struggle with precise control over fine-grained visual
attributes and intricate spatial relationships. Our Hi-SSLVLM addresses these
limitations through a unique two-stage self-supervised learning strategy. The
first stage, Multi-Granularity Visual-Language Grounding, enables the Large
Vision-Language Model (LVLM) backbone to autonomously generate and align
hierarchical captions (global and local) to images, cultivating a deep internal
semantic understanding without reliance on extensive human annotation. The
second stage, Self-Refinement and Guided Image Generation, leverages this
acquired knowledge by an Internal Compositional Planning (ICP) mechanism, where
the LVLM first formulates detailed textual sub-prompts to guide the image
generation process, complemented by a novel Semantic Consistency Loss for
precise output alignment. Comprehensive experiments against leading baselines,
including Janus-Pro-1B, Stable Diffusion XL 1.0, DeepFloyd IF v1.0, and
ControlNet-XL, on multi-dimensional benchmarks such as Gemini-2.0-Flash and
InternVL3-78B, demonstrate Hi-SSLVLM's superior performance across all
fine-grained metrics. An in-depth ablation study confirms the critical role of
each proposed component. Furthermore, human evaluations corroborate our
quantitative findings, highlighting Hi-SSLVLM's enhanced fidelity to prompt,
compositional accuracy, and overall aesthetic quality, marking a significant
step towards more controllable and semantically consistent open-ended
text-to-image generation.

Motivation: 当前大型视觉语言模型在复杂文本描述的精确组合理解和视觉规划方面表现不足，影响了多对象、属性和空间关系的准确渲染。

Method: 提出LVLM-Composer，包含分层语义规划模块和细粒度特征对齐机制，采用多阶段训练范式（分层语义-视觉预训练和组合规划强化学习）。

Conclusion: LVLM-Composer为可控且组合准确的开放式文本到图像生成迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: The burgeoning field of generative artificial intelligence has fundamentally
reshaped our approach to content creation, with Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) standing at its forefront. While current LVLMs have demonstrated
impressive capabilities in text-to-image generation, they often falter when
confronted with complex textual descriptions demanding precise compositional
understanding and visual planning. This limitation particularly impacts the
accurate rendering of multiple objects, their attributes, spatial
relationships, and specific poses within intricate scenes, as evidenced by
benchmarks like LongBench-T2I. To address these challenges, we introduce
LVLM-Composer, a novel 10-billion parameter scale LVLM specifically engineered
for enhanced compositional image synthesis. Our method incorporates a
Hierarchical Semantic Planning Module for structured prompt decomposition and a
Fine-Grained Feature Alignment Mechanism for precise visual guidance during
generation. We propose a multi-stage training paradigm, featuring Hierarchical
Semantic-Visual Grounding Pre-training and Compositional Planning Reinforcement
Learning with Self-Correction, to instill robust compositional reasoning.
Extensive experiments on the LongBench-T2I benchmark, utilizing automatic
evaluation by Gemini-2.0-Flash and InternVL3-78B, demonstrate LVLM-Composer's
superior performance across critical compositional dimensions including object
accuracy, composition fidelity, and pose accuracy, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines. An in-depth ablation study further validates the
indispensable contribution of our proposed modules, while human evaluations
confirm the perceptual superiority of our generated images. LVLM-Composer
represents a significant step towards truly controllable and compositionally
accurate open-ended text-to-image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究从单视图生成无边界动态场景的问题，应用于增强/虚拟现实和机器人领域。现有方法因依赖多视图训练，生成场景受限。

Method: 将单视图视频映射为动态点云，利用射线上下文外绘视频以生成3D一致运动，并通过外绘视频更新点云。

Result: 实验表明，模型能生成无边界场景，运动一致且可通过场景提示控制内容。

Conclusion: DynamicVoyager有效解决了单视图生成动态场景的3D一致性问题，扩展了应用范围。

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of generating an unbounded dynamic scene from
a single view, which has wide applications in augmented/virtual reality and
robotics. Since the scene is changing over time, different generated views need
to be consistent with the underlying 3D motions. While previous works learn
such consistency by training from multiple views, the generated scene regions
are bounded to be close to the training views with limited camera movements. To
address this issue, we propose DynamicVoyager that reformulates the dynamic
scene generation as a scene outpainting process for new dynamic content. As 2D
outpainting models can hardly generate 3D consistent motions from only 2D
pixels at a single view, we consider pixels as rays to enrich the pixel input
with the ray context, so that the 3D motion consistency can be learned from the
ray information. More specifically, we first map the single-view video input to
a dynamic point cloud with the estimated video depths. Then we render the
partial video at a novel view and outpaint the video with ray contexts from the
point cloud to generate 3D consistent motions. We employ the outpainted video
to update the point cloud, which is used for scene outpainting from future
novel views. Experiments show that our model is able to generate unbounded
scenes with consistent motions along fly-through cameras, and the generated
contents can be controlled with scene prompts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着像素尺寸的缩小，图像质量因光积累减少而下降，需平衡分辨率、噪声和动态范围。

Method: 采用空间变化的增益和像素合并策略，根据局部场景亮度调整增益和合并大小。

Result: 动态范围扩展了一个数量级，信噪比显著提升，数字合并优于模拟合并。

Conclusion: 空间变化的增益和像素合并技术能有效提升图像质量，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: Pixels in image sensors have progressively become smaller, driven by the goal
of producing higher-resolution imagery. However, ceteris paribus, a smaller
pixel accumulates less light, making image quality worse. This interplay of
resolution, noise, and the dynamic range of the sensor and their impact on the
eventual quality of acquired imagery is a fundamental concept in photography.
In this paper, we propose spatially-varying gain and binning to enhance the
noise performance and dynamic range of image sensors. First, we show that by
varying gain spatially to local scene brightness, the read noise can be made
negligible, and the dynamic range of a sensor is expanded by an order of
magnitude. Second, we propose a simple analysis to find a binning size that
best balances resolution and noise for a given light level; this analysis
predicts a spatially-varying binning strategy, again based on local scene
brightness, to effectively increase the overall signal-to-noise ratio. %
without sacrificing resolution. We discuss analog and digital binning modes
and, perhaps surprisingly, show that digital binning outperforms its analog
counterparts when a larger gain is allowed. Finally, we demonstrate that
combining spatially-varying gain and binning in various applications, including
high dynamic range imaging, vignetting, and lens distortion.

Motivation: 现有零样本方法在图像恢复任务中迭代时间过长，限制了扩散模型的实际应用。

Method: 通过QBM从中间近似初始化以绕过早期去噪步骤，并结合RRP调整噪声权重以增强随机性。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K和CelebA-HQ上的实验表明，该方法能有效加速现有方法并保持性能。

Conclusion: QBM和RRP为扩散模型在图像恢复任务中的高效应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success
in various image generation tasks. Building upon these achievements, diffusion
models have also been effectively adapted to image restoration tasks, e.g.,
super-resolution and deblurring, aiming to recover high-quality images from
degraded inputs. Although existing zero-shot approaches enable pretrained
diffusion models to perform restoration tasks without additional fine-tuning,
these methods often suffer from prolonged iteration times in the denoising
process. To address this limitation, we propose a Quick Bypass Mechanism (QBM),
a strategy that significantly accelerates the denoising process by initializing
from an intermediate approximation, effectively bypassing early denoising
steps. Furthermore, recognizing that approximation may introduce
inconsistencies, we introduce a Revised Reverse Process (RRP), which adjusts
the weighting of random noise to enhance the stochasticity and mitigate
potential disharmony. We validate proposed methods on ImageNet-1K and CelebA-HQ
across multiple image restoration tasks, e.g., super-resolution, deblurring,
and compressed sensing. Our experimental results show that the proposed methods
can effectively accelerate existing methods while maintaining original
performance.

Abstract: This paper presents a portrait style transfer method that generalizes well to
various different domains while enabling high-quality semantic-aligned
stylization on regions including hair, eyes, eyelashes, skins, lips, and
background. To this end, we propose to establish dense semantic correspondence
between the given input and reference portraits based on a pre-trained model
and a semantic adapter, with which we obtain a warped reference semantically
aligned with the input. To ensure effective yet controllable style transfer, we
devise an AdaIN-Wavelet transform to balance content preservation and
stylization by blending low-frequency information of the warped reference with
high-frequency information of the input in the latent space. A style adapter is
also designed to provide style guidance from the warped reference. With the
stylized latent from AdaIN-Wavelet transform, we employ a dual-conditional
diffusion model that integrates a ControlNet recording high-frequency
information and the style guidance to generate the final result. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method. Our code and trained
model are available at https://github.com/wangxb29/DGPST.

Conclusion: MoReMouse为实验室小鼠的3D重建提供了高效解决方案，填补了研究空白。

Abstract: Laboratory mice play a crucial role in biomedical research, yet accurate 3D
mouse surface motion reconstruction remains challenging due to their complex
non-rigid geometric deformations and textureless appearance. Moreover, the
absence of structured 3D datasets severely hinders the progress beyond sparse
keypoint tracking. To narrow the gap, we present MoReMouse, the first monocular
dense 3D reconstruction network tailored for laboratory mice. To achieve this
goal, we highlight three key designs. First, we construct the first
high-fidelity dense-view synthetic dataset for mice, by rendering our
self-designed realistic Gaussian mouse avatar. Second, MoReMouse adopts a
transformer-based feedforward architecture with triplane representation,
achieving high-quality 3D surface generation from a single image. Third, we
create geodesic-based continuous correspondence embeddings on mouse surface,
which serve as strong semantic priors to improve reconstruction stability and
surface consistency. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments
demonstrate that MoReMouse significantly outperforms existing open-source
methods in accuracy and robustness. Video results are available at

Result: 在CIFAR-10等基准测试中，GSTDS计算需求降低4倍，性能不降反升，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 光谱数据选择是资源高效深度学习的可行方案，值得进一步探索自适应数据管理策略。

Abstract: Effective data curation is essential for optimizing neural network training.
In this paper, we present the Guided Spectrally Tuned Data Selection (GSTDS)
algorithm, which dynamically adjusts the subset of data points used for
training using an off-the-shelf pre-trained reference model. Based on a
pre-scheduled filtering ratio, GSTDS effectively reduces the number of data
points processed per batch. The proposed method ensures an efficient selection
of the most informative data points for training while avoiding redundant or
less beneficial computations. Preserving data points in each batch is performed
based on spectral analysis. A Fiedler vector-based scoring mechanism removes
the filtered portion of the batch, lightening the resource requirements of the
learning. The proposed data selection approach not only streamlines the
training process but also promotes improved generalization and accuracy.
Extensive experiments on standard image classification benchmarks, including
CIFAR-10, Oxford-IIIT Pet, and Oxford-Flowers, demonstrate that GSTDS
outperforms standard training scenarios and JEST, a recent state-of-the-art
data curation method, on several key factors. It is shown that GSTDS achieves
notable reductions in computational requirements, up to four times, without
compromising performance. GSTDS exhibits a considerable growth in terms of
accuracy under the limited computational resource usage, in contrast to other
methodologies. These promising results underscore the potential of
spectral-based data selection as a scalable solution for resource-efficient
deep learning and motivate further exploration into adaptive data curation
strategies. You can find the code at https://github.com/rezasharifi82/GSTDS.

Result: 在LOL数据集上PSNR达19.04 dB，参数仅0.07%，在移动设备上实现30 FPS的4K图像实时处理。

Conclusion: LiteIE是资源受限平台上高效实用的低光增强解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time low-light image enhancement on mobile and embedded devices requires
models that balance visual quality and computational efficiency. Existing deep
learning methods often rely on large networks and labeled datasets, limiting
their deployment on resource-constrained platforms. In this paper, we propose
LiteIE, an ultra-lightweight unsupervised enhancement framework that eliminates
dependence on large-scale supervision and generalizes well across diverse
conditions. We design a backbone-agnostic feature extractor with only two
convolutional layers to produce compact image features enhancement tensors. In
addition, we develop a parameter-free Iterative Restoration Module, which
reuses the extracted features to progressively recover fine details lost in
earlier enhancement steps, without introducing any additional learnable
parameters. We further propose an unsupervised training objective that
integrates exposure control, edge-aware smoothness, and multi-scale color
consistency losses. Experiments on the LOL dataset, LiteIE achieves 19.04 dB
PSNR, surpassing SOTA by 1.4 dB while using only 0.07\% of its parameters. On a
Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 mobile processor, LiteIE runs at 30 FPS for 4K images with
just 58 parameters, enabling real-time deployment on edge devices. These
results establish LiteIE as an efficient and practical solution for low-light
enhancement on resource-limited platforms.

Motivation: 现有视频理解基准局限于英语且缺乏深度推理能力，无法满足医学教育等专业领域的需求。

Method: M3-Med包含医学问题与视频片段配对，通过多跳推理任务（文本定位、视觉证据查找、跨模态信息合成）评估模型的深度理解能力。

Result: 实验表明，现有模型（包括大语言模型）在多跳推理任务上表现显著低于人类专家。

Conclusion: M3-Med揭示了AI模型在专业领域深度跨模态推理的局限性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of artificial intelligence (AI) in multi-modal
understanding, there is increasing potential for video comprehension
technologies to support professional domains such as medical education.
However, existing benchmarks suffer from two primary limitations: (1)
Linguistic Singularity: they are largely confined to English, neglecting the
need for multilingual resources; and (2) Shallow Reasoning: their questions are
often designed for surface-level information retrieval, failing to properly
assess deep multi-modal integration. To address these limitations, we present
M3-Med, the first benchmark for Multi-lingual, Multi-modal, and Multi-hop
reasoning in Medical instructional video understanding. M3-Med consists of
medical questions paired with corresponding video segments, annotated by a team
of medical experts. A key innovation of M3-Med is its multi-hop reasoning task,
which requires a model to first locate a key entity in the text, then find
corresponding visual evidence in the video, and finally synthesize information
across both modalities to derive the answer. This design moves beyond simple
text matching and poses a substantial challenge to a model's deep cross-modal
understanding capabilities. We define two tasks: Temporal Answer Grounding in
Single Video (TAGSV) and Temporal Answer Grounding in Video Corpus (TAGVC). We
evaluated several state-of-the-art models and Large Language Models (LLMs) on
M3-Med. The results reveal a significant performance gap between all models and
human experts, especially on the complex multi-hop questions where model
performance drops sharply. M3-Med effectively highlights the current
limitations of AI models in deep cross-modal reasoning within specialized

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在视觉生成任务中表现优异，但高计算复杂度限制了其在边缘设备上的应用。现有量化方法在极低位下性能下降严重。

Method: 提出Flexible Z-Order Residual Mixed Quantization处理异常值，Object-Oriented Low-Rank Initialization优化初始化，以及Memory-based Temporal Relation Distillation保持时间一致性。

Result: 在各种生成任务中，MPQ-DMv2在不同架构下显著优于现有方法，尤其在极低位宽下表现突出。

Conclusion: MPQ-DMv2通过改进的量化设计和优化策略，有效提升了极低位扩散模型的性能，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance on vision
generation tasks. However, the high computational complexity hinders its wide
application on edge devices. Quantization has emerged as a promising technique
for inference acceleration and memory reduction. However, existing quantization
methods do not generalize well under extremely low-bit (2-4 bit) quantization.
Directly applying these methods will cause severe performance degradation. We
identify that the existing quantization framework suffers from the
outlier-unfriendly quantizer design, suboptimal initialization, and
optimization strategy. We present MPQ-DMv2, an improved \textbf{M}ixed
\textbf{P}recision \textbf{Q}uantization framework for extremely low-bit
\textbf{D}iffusion \textbf{M}odels. For the quantization perspective, the
imbalanced distribution caused by salient outliers is quantization-unfriendly
for uniform quantizer. We propose \textit{Flexible Z-Order Residual Mixed
Quantization} that utilizes an efficient binary residual branch for flexible
quant steps to handle salient error. For the optimization framework, we
theoretically analyzed the convergence and optimality of the LoRA module and
propose \textit{Object-Oriented Low-Rank Initialization} to use prior
quantization error for informative initialization. We then propose
\textit{Memory-based Temporal Relation Distillation} to construct an online
time-aware pixel queue for long-term denoising temporal information
distillation, which ensures the overall temporal consistency between quantized
and full-precision model. Comprehensive experiments on various generation tasks
show that our MPQ-DMv2 surpasses current SOTA methods by a great margin on
different architectures, especially under extremely low-bit widths.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出LEAwareSGD方法，通过Lyapunov指数动态调整学习率，提升单域泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单域泛化（SDG）面临域偏移大和数据多样性不足的挑战，现有方法难以适应。

Method: 利用Lyapunov指数（LE）引导优化，动态调整学习率，使模型训练处于混沌边缘状态。

Result: 在PACS、OfficeHome和DomainNet上实验，LEAwareSGD在低数据场景下提升泛化能力达9.47%。

Conclusion: 训练处于混沌边缘状态能有效提升SDG任务的模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Single Domain Generalization (SDG) aims to develop models capable of
generalizing to unseen target domains using only one source domain, a task
complicated by substantial domain shifts and limited data diversity. Existing
SDG approaches primarily rely on data augmentation techniques, which struggle
to effectively adapt training dynamics to accommodate large domain shifts. To
address this, we propose LEAwareSGD, a novel Lyapunov Exponent (LE)-guided
optimization approach inspired by dynamical systems theory. By leveraging LE
measurements to modulate the learning rate, LEAwareSGD encourages model
training near the edge of chaos, a critical state that optimally balances
stability and adaptability. This dynamic adjustment allows the model to explore
a wider parameter space and capture more generalizable features, ultimately
enhancing the model's generalization capability. Extensive experiments on PACS,
OfficeHome, and DomainNet demonstrate that LEAwareSGD yields substantial
generalization gains, achieving up to 9.47\% improvement on PACS in low-data
regimes. These results underscore the effectiveness of training near the edge
of chaos for enhancing model generalization capability in SDG tasks.

Motivation: 当前rPPG方法在动态夜间光照条件下的有效性未知，且缺乏专门针对此类挑战性环境的数据集，阻碍了研究进展。

Method: 收集并发布了DLCN数据集，包含98名参与者的13小时视频数据和同步生理信号，覆盖四种典型夜间光照场景。

Result: DLCN数据集具有高多样性和真实性，为评估算法在复杂条件下的鲁棒性提供了宝贵资源。

Conclusion: 通过Happy-rPPG Toolkit进行实验和分析，揭示了现有rPPG方法在DLCN上的挑战，数据集和代码已公开。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a non-contact technique for measuring
human physiological signals. Due to its convenience and non-invasiveness, it
has demonstrated broad application potential in areas such as health monitoring
and emotion recognition. In recent years, the release of numerous public
datasets has significantly advanced the performance of rPPG algorithms under
ideal lighting conditions. However, the effectiveness of current rPPG methods
in realistic nighttime scenarios with dynamic lighting variations remains
largely unknown. Moreover, there is a severe lack of datasets specifically
designed for such challenging environments, which has substantially hindered
progress in this area of research. To address this gap, we present and release
a large-scale rPPG dataset collected under dynamic lighting conditions at
night, named DLCN. The dataset comprises approximately 13 hours of video data
and corresponding synchronized physiological signals from 98 participants,
covering four representative nighttime lighting scenarios. DLCN offers high
diversity and realism, making it a valuable resource for evaluating algorithm
robustness in complex conditions. Built upon the proposed Happy-rPPG Toolkit,
we conduct extensive experiments and provide a comprehensive analysis of the
challenges faced by state-of-the-art rPPG methods when applied to DLCN. The
dataset and code are publicly available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种端到端框架DMAT，通过学习补偿失真特征，同时提升图像质量和目标检测性能，在受大气湍流影响的序列上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大气湍流（AT）会降低监控图像的清晰度和准确性，影响可视化质量和目标分类、场景跟踪。现有深度学习方法在正常条件下表现良好，但在AT失真序列上效果不佳。

Method: DMAT框架结合了AT缓解器和目标检测器，利用3D Mamba结构处理时空位移和模糊，通过金字塔方式提取特征并传递到检测器，通过反向传播优化两者。

Result: DMAT在受湍流影响的测试集上，比现有AT缓解和目标检测系统性能提升高达15%。

Conclusion: DMAT框架通过联合优化AT缓解和目标检测，有效提升了在AT失真序列上的性能，为相关应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Atmospheric Turbulence (AT) degrades the clarity and accuracy of surveillance
imagery, posing challenges not only for visualization quality but also for
object classification and scene tracking. Deep learning-based methods have been
proposed to improve visual quality, but spatio-temporal distortions remain a
significant issue. Although deep learning-based object detection performs well
under normal conditions, it struggles to operate effectively on sequences
distorted by atmospheric turbulence. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework that learns to compensate for distorted features while simultaneously
improving visualization and object detection. This end-to-end framework
leverages and exchanges knowledge of low-level distorted features in the AT
mitigator with semantic features extracted in the object detector.
Specifically, in the AT mitigator a 3D Mamba-based structure is used to handle
the spatio-temporal displacements and blurring caused by turbulence. Features
are extracted in a pyramid manner during the mitigation stage and passed to the
detector. Optimization is achieved through back-propagation in both the AT
mitigator and object detector. Our proposed DMAT outperforms state-of-the-art
AT mitigation and object detection systems up to a 15% improvement on datasets
corrupted by generated turbulence.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）和图表示的医学视觉问答（VQA）框架，通过跨模态图整合视觉和文本特征，显著提升了CT影像问答的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学VQA方法独立提取视觉和文本特征，忽略了CT数据的空间连续性和切片间相关性，导致回答不精确。

Method: 构建跨模态图，将CT切片和问题标记作为节点，利用图卷积网络动态融合信息，生成软提示指导LLM回答。

Result: 在M3D-VQA基准测试中，该方法在多指标上优于基线，展现出更强的推理能力。

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过图表示增强LLM，显著提升了医学VQA的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Visual question answering (VQA) in medical imaging aims to support clinical
diagnosis by automatically interpreting complex imaging data in response to
natural language queries. Existing studies typically rely on distinct visual
and textual encoders to independently extract features from medical images and
clinical questions, which are subsequently combined to generate answers.
Specifically, in computed tomography (CT), such approaches are similar to the
conventional practices in medical image analysis. However, these approaches pay
less attention to the spatial continuity and inter-slice correlations in the
volumetric CT data, leading to fragmented and imprecise responses. In this
paper, we propose a novel large language model (LLM)-based framework enhanced
by a graph representation of salient features. Different from conventional
multimodal encoding strategies, our approach constructs a cross-modal graph
integrating both visual and textual features, treating individual CT slices and
question tokens as nodes within the graph. We further leverage an attentive
graph convolutional network to dynamically fuse information within this
structure. The resulting aggregated graph features then serve as a soft prompt
to guide a large language model in generating accurate answers. Extensive
experiments on the M3D-VQA benchmark demonstrate that our approach consistently
outperforms baselines across multiple evaluation metrics, offering more robust
reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于纯Mamba块的高效密集全局融合方法，用于相机-LiDAR多模态3D目标检测，解决了现有方法在效率、长距离建模和完整场景信息保留上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有融合策略无法同时满足效率、长距离建模和完整场景信息保留的需求，因此需要一种新方法。

Method: 利用状态空间模型（SSMs）和线性注意力的线性复杂度和长距离建模能力，提出高度保真的LiDAR编码和混合Mamba块，以增强多模态对齐和上下文学习。

Result: 在nuScenes验证基准上取得了75.0的NDS最高分，超越了使用高分辨率输入的方法，同时保持了高效推理速度。

Conclusion: 该方法通过高度保真的LiDAR编码和混合Mamba块，实现了高效且高性能的多模态3D目标检测。

Abstract: We present the first work demonstrating that a pure Mamba block can achieve
efficient Dense Global Fusion, meanwhile guaranteeing top performance for
camera-LiDAR multi-modal 3D object detection. Our motivation stems from the
observation that existing fusion strategies are constrained by their inability
to simultaneously achieve efficiency, long-range modeling, and retaining
complete scene information. Inspired by recent advances in state-space models
(SSMs) and linear attention, we leverage their linear complexity and long-range
modeling capabilities to address these challenges. However, this is non-trivial
since our experiments reveal that simply adopting efficient linear-complexity
methods does not necessarily yield improvements and may even degrade
performance. We attribute this degradation to the loss of height information
during multi-modal alignment, leading to deviations in sequence order. To
resolve this, we propose height-fidelity LiDAR encoding that preserves precise
height information through voxel compression in continuous space, thereby
enhancing camera-LiDAR alignment. Subsequently, we introduce the Hybrid Mamba
Block, which leverages the enriched height-informed features to conduct local
and global contextual learning. By integrating these components, our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance with the top-tire NDS score of 75.0 on
the nuScenes validation benchmark, even surpassing methods that utilize
high-resolution inputs. Meanwhile, our method maintains efficiency, achieving
faster inference speed than most recent state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 墓碑作为历史和文化的重要载体，面临保存挑战，需要数字化手段以保护和解读其内容。

Method: 结合视觉语言模型（VLM）将墓碑图像转换为结构化表示（TMR），并利用检索增强生成（RAG）整合外部依赖元素。

Result: 解析准确率从传统OCR的36.1 F1提升至89.5 F1，并在多样文化和语言环境中验证了鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该研究首次利用大规模视觉语言模型标准化墓碑理解，对文化遗产保护具有重要意义。

Abstract: Tombstones are historically and culturally rich artifacts, encapsulating
individual lives, community memory, historical narratives and artistic
expression. Yet, many tombstones today face significant preservation
challenges, including physical erosion, vandalism, environmental degradation,
and political shifts. In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-modal framework
for tombstones digitization, aiming to improve the interpretation, organization
and retrieval of tombstone content. Our approach leverages vision-language
models (VLMs) to translate tombstone images into structured Tombstone Meaning
Representations (TMRs), capturing both image and text information. To further
enrich semantic parsing, we incorporate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
for integrate externally dependent elements such as toponyms, occupation codes,
and ontological concepts. Compared to traditional OCR-based pipelines, our
method improves parsing accuracy from an F1 score of 36.1 to 89.5. We
additionally evaluate the model's robustness across diverse linguistic and
cultural inscriptions, and simulate physical degradation through image fusion
to assess performance under noisy or damaged conditions. Our work represents
the first attempt to formalize tombstone understanding using large
vision-language models, presenting implications for heritage preservation.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于任务算术框架的方法，将自解释模型的视觉可解释性从源域迁移到目标域，提升目标域的解释质量且不牺牲分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自解释模型训练中高昂的标注和计算成本问题，通过迁移学习实现高效的可解释性传递。

Method: 扩展基于视觉语言预训练模型的图像分类器，定义可解释性向量，并通过任务算术框架将其应用于目标域模型。

Result: 实验表明，除部分不相关域外，可解释性成功迁移，且解释质量接近Kernel SHAP（仅需单次推理）。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且通用，适用于多领域，显著降低解释成本。

Abstract: In scenarios requiring both prediction and explanation efficiency for image
classification, self-explaining models that perform both tasks in a single
inference are effective. However, their training incurs substantial labeling
and computational costs. This study aims to tackle the issue by proposing a
method to transfer the visual explainability of self-explaining models, learned
in a source domain, to a target domain based on a task arithmetic framework.
Specifically, we construct a self-explaining model by extending image
classifiers based on a vision-language pretrained model. We then define an
\emph{explainability vector} as the difference between model parameters trained
on the source domain with and without explanation supervision. Based on the
task arithmetic framework, we impart explainability to a model trained only on
the prediction task in the target domain by applying the explainability vector.
Experimental results on various image classification datasets demonstrate that,
except for transfers between some less-related domains, visual explainability
can be successfully transferred from source to target domains, improving
explanation quality in the target domain without sacrificing classification
accuracy. Furthermore, we show that the explainability vector learned on a
large and diverse dataset like ImageNet, extended with explanation supervision,
exhibits universality and robustness, improving explanation quality on nine out
of ten different target datasets. We also find that the explanation quality
achieved with a single model inference is comparable to that of Kernel SHAP,
which requires 150 model inferences.

Motivation: 现有方法仅关注单一层的信息，忽略了决策过程中跨层的证据分布。

Result: 实验表明CoIBA显著提升了特征归因的忠实性。

Conclusion: CoIBA通过跨层信息共享和变分方法，有效捕捉了决策过程中的遗漏线索。

Abstract: The feature attribution method reveals the contribution of input variables to
the decision-making process to provide an attribution map for explanation.
Existing methods grounded on the information bottleneck principle compute
information in a specific layer to obtain attributions, compressing the
features by injecting noise via a parametric damping ratio. However, the
attribution obtained in a specific layer neglects evidence of the
decision-making process distributed across layers. In this paper, we introduce
a comprehensive information bottleneck (CoIBA), which discovers the relevant
information in each targeted layer to explain the decision-making process. Our
core idea is applying information bottleneck in multiple targeted layers to
estimate the comprehensive information by sharing a parametric damping ratio
across the layers. Leveraging this shared ratio complements the over-compressed
information to discover the omitted clues of the decision by sharing the
relevant information across the targeted layers. We suggest the variational
approach to fairly reflect the relevant information of each layer by upper
bounding layer-wise information. Therefore, CoIBA guarantees that the discarded
activation is unnecessary in every targeted layer to make a decision. The
extensive experimental results demonstrate the enhancement in faithfulness of
the feature attributions provided by CoIBA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨模态遥感图像配准面临非线性辐射变化和纹理有限的挑战，现有CNN和Transformer方法在全局特征提取和计算效率上存在不足。

Method: 采用多方向交叉扫描策略捕获全局上下文关系，结合多专家特征学习（MEFL）策略动态融合多专家特征，并通过多级特征聚合（MFA）模块整合局部与全局特征。

Result: 在多种分辨率的CRSI上实验表明，RegistrationMamba在性能和鲁棒性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RegistrationMamba通过SSMs和MEFL策略有效提升了CRSI配准的准确性和适应性，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Cross-modal remote sensing image (CRSI) registration is critical for
multi-modal image applications. However, CRSI mainly faces two challenges:
significant nonlinear radiometric variations between cross-modal images and
limited textures hindering the discriminative information extraction. Existing
methods mainly adopt convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or Transformer
architectures to extract discriminative features for registration. However,
CNNs with the local receptive field fail to capture global contextual features,
and Transformers have high computational complexity and restrict their
application to high-resolution CRSI. To solve these issues, this paper proposes
RegistrationMamba, a novel Mamba architecture based on state space models
(SSMs) integrating multi-expert feature learning for improving the accuracy of
CRSI registration. Specifically, RegistrationMamba employs a multi-directional
cross-scanning strategy to capture global contextual relationships with linear
complexity. To enhance the performance of RegistrationMamba under
texture-limited scenarios, we propose a multi-expert feature learning (MEFL)
strategy to capture features from various augmented image variants through
multiple feature experts. MEFL leverages a learnable soft router to dynamically
fuse the features from multiple experts, thereby enriching feature
representations and improving registration performance. Notably, MEFL can be
seamlessly integrated into various frameworks, substantially boosting
registration performance. Additionally, RegistrationMamba integrates a
multi-level feature aggregation (MFA) module to extract fine-grained local
information and enable effective interaction between global and local features.
Extensive experiments on CRSI with varying image resolutions have demonstrated
that RegistrationMamba has superior performance and robustness compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 在合成数据集上验证，框架从单张卫星图像生成高保真3D结构，优于现有模型。

Conclusion: Sat2City为3D城市生成提供了高效解决方案，适用于游戏、数字孪生等领域。

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have enabled 3D urban scene
generation from satellite imagery, unlocking promising applications in gaming,
digital twins, and beyond. However, most existing methods rely heavily on
neural rendering techniques, which hinder their ability to produce detailed 3D
structures on a broader scale, largely due to the inherent structural ambiguity
derived from relatively limited 2D observations. To address this challenge, we
propose Sat2City, a novel framework that synergizes the representational
capacity of sparse voxel grids with latent diffusion models, tailored
specifically for our novel 3D city dataset. Our approach is enabled by three
key components: (1) A cascaded latent diffusion framework that progressively
recovers 3D city structures from satellite imagery, (2) a Re-Hash operation at
its Variational Autoencoder (VAE) bottleneck to compute multi-scale feature
grids for stable appearance optimization and (3) an inverse sampling strategy
enabling implicit supervision for smooth appearance transitioning.To overcome
the challenge of collecting real-world city-scale 3D models with high-quality
geometry and appearance, we introduce a dataset of synthesized large-scale 3D
cities paired with satellite-view height maps. Validated on this dataset, our
framework generates detailed 3D structures from a single satellite image,
achieving superior fidelity compared to existing city generation models.

Motivation: 传统深度估计模型需要昂贵的3D监督且泛化能力差，导致在无边界场景中深度估计不准确。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有NeRF变体和深度正则化方法。

Conclusion: 视角一致分布和深度推动损失联合正则化有效提升了NeRF的性能，尤其在无边界场景中。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has emerged as a compelling framework for scene
representation and 3D recovery. To improve its performance on real-world data,
depth regularizations have proven to be the most effective ones. However, depth
estimation models not only require expensive 3D supervision in training, but
also suffer from generalization issues. As a result, the depth estimations can
be erroneous in practice, especially for outdoor unbounded scenes. In this
paper, we propose to employ view-consistent distributions instead of fixed
depth value estimations to regularize NeRF training. Specifically, the
distribution is computed by utilizing both low-level color features and
high-level distilled features from foundation models at the projected 2D
pixel-locations from per-ray sampled 3D points. By sampling from the
view-consistency distributions, an implicit regularization is imposed on the
training of NeRF. We also utilize a depth-pushing loss that works in
conjunction with the sampling technique to jointly provide effective
regularizations for eliminating the failure modes. Extensive experiments
conducted on various scenes from public datasets demonstrate that our proposed
method can generate significantly better novel view synthesis results than
state-of-the-art NeRF variants as well as different depth regularization
methods.

Conclusion: MVNet展示了处理复杂高光谱图像数据的强大能力，并解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification faces challenges such as
high-dimensional data, limited training samples, and spectral redundancy, which
often lead to overfitting and insufficient generalization capability. This
paper proposes a novel MVNet network architecture that integrates 3D-CNN's
local feature extraction, Transformer's global modeling, and Mamba's linear
complexity sequence modeling capabilities, achieving efficient spatial-spectral
feature extraction and fusion. MVNet features a redesigned dual-branch Mamba
module, including a State Space Model (SSM) branch and a non-SSM branch
employing 1D convolution with SiLU activation, enhancing modeling of both
short-range and long-range dependencies while reducing computational latency in
traditional Mamba. The optimized HSI-MambaVision Mixer module overcomes the
unidirectional limitation of causal convolution, capturing bidirectional
spatial-spectral dependencies in a single forward pass through decoupled
attention that focuses on high-value features, alleviating parameter redundancy
and the curse of dimensionality. On IN, UP, and KSC datasets, MVNet outperforms
mainstream hyperspectral image classification methods in both classification
accuracy and computational efficiency, demonstrating robust capability in
processing complex HSI data.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注食物类别，缺乏全面的食物属性基准，且许多属性（如甜度、重量）难以通过RGB相机准确感知。

Method: 组织现有食物数据集，收集数百种食物的高光谱图像，并使用仪器实验测定食物属性（如甜度、重量）。

Result: 构建了包含3,266种食物类别和2,351k数据点的基准，发现大规模模型在数字化食物方面表现不佳，光谱数据对分析食物属性至关重要。

Conclusion: SFOOD基准将开源并持续迭代，推动智能食物分析的发展。

Abstract: With the rise and development of computer vision and LLMs, intelligence is
everywhere, especially for people and cars. However, for tremendous food
attributes (such as origin, quantity, weight, quality, sweetness, etc.),
existing research still mainly focuses on the study of categories. The reason
is the lack of a large and comprehensive benchmark for food. Besides, many food
attributes (such as sweetness, weight, and fine-grained categories) are
challenging to accurately percept solely through RGB cameras. To fulfill this
gap and promote the development of intelligent food analysis, in this paper, we
built the first large-scale spectral food (SFOOD) benchmark suite. We spent a
lot of manpower and equipment costs to organize existing food datasets and
collect hyperspectral images of hundreds of foods, and we used instruments to
experimentally determine food attributes such as sweetness and weight. The
resulting benchmark consists of 3,266 food categories and 2,351 k data points
for 17 main food categories. Extensive evaluations find that: (i) Large-scale
models are still poor at digitizing food. Compared to people and cars, food has
gradually become one of the most difficult objects to study; (ii) Spectrum data
are crucial for analyzing food properties (such as sweetness). Our benchmark
will be open source and continuously iterated for different food analysis
tasks.

TL;DR: CoT-Diff通过将多模态大语言模型驱动的3D布局规划与扩散过程紧密结合，显著提升了文本到图像生成的空间对齐和组合保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前文本到图像生成模型在复杂场景中难以对齐空间组合的问题。

Method: CoT-Diff框架在单次扩散过程中集成MLLM驱动的3D布局规划，通过动态更新布局和条件感知注意力机制实现精确控制。

Result: 在3D场景基准测试中，CoT-Diff在复杂场景空间准确性上比现有最佳方法提高了34.7%。

Conclusion: CoT-Diff验证了这种紧密耦合生成范式的有效性，显著提升了空间对齐和语义注入能力。

Abstract: Current text-to-image (T2I) generation models struggle to align spatial
composition with the input text, especially in complex scenes. Even
layout-based approaches yield suboptimal spatial control, as their generation
process is decoupled from layout planning, making it difficult to refine the
layout during synthesis. We present CoT-Diff, a framework that brings
step-by-step CoT-style reasoning into T2I generation by tightly integrating
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-driven 3D layout planning with the
diffusion process. CoT-Diff enables layout-aware reasoning inline within a
single diffusion round: at each denoising step, the MLLM evaluates intermediate
predictions, dynamically updates the 3D scene layout, and continuously guides
the generation process. The updated layout is converted into semantic
conditions and depth maps, which are fused into the diffusion model via a
condition-aware attention mechanism, enabling precise spatial control and
semantic injection. Experiments on 3D Scene benchmarks show that CoT-Diff
significantly improves spatial alignment and compositional fidelity, and
outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 34.7% in complex scene spatial
accuracy, thereby validating the effectiveness of this entangled generation
paradigm.

TL;DR: BiVM是一种高效的二值化神经网络，用于实时视频抠图，通过改进编码器和解码器设计，显著提升了精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘设备上的深度神经网络在实时视频抠图中存在计算限制，限制了其广泛应用。二值化是一种常见的压缩方法，但现有方法在精度和效率上存在不足。

Method: BiVM采用弹性快捷连接和可进化拓扑的二值化计算结构改进编码器，并通过掩码稀疏化解码器中间特征以减少冗余计算。此外，提出了一种局部二值化感知模仿框架。

Result: BiVM在精度上显著优于其他二值化视频抠图网络，计算和存储成本分别节省了14.3倍和21.6倍。

Conclusion: BiVM通过优化编码器和解码器设计，解决了二值化视频抠图中的精度和效率问题，适用于边缘设备。

Abstract: Deep neural networks for real-time video matting suffer significant
computational limitations on edge devices, hindering their adoption in
widespread applications such as online conferences and short-form video
production. Binarization emerges as one of the most common compression
approaches with compact 1-bit parameters and efficient bitwise operations.
However, accuracy and efficiency limitations exist in the binarized video
matting network due to its degenerated encoder and redundant decoder. Following
a theoretical analysis based on the information bottleneck principle, the
limitations are mainly caused by the degradation of prediction-relevant
information in the intermediate features and the redundant computation in
prediction-irrelevant areas. We present BiVM, an accurate and
resource-efficient Binarized neural network for Video Matting. First, we
present a series of binarized computation structures with elastic shortcuts and
evolvable topologies, enabling the constructed encoder backbone to extract
high-quality representation from input videos for accurate prediction. Second,
we sparse the intermediate feature of the binarized decoder by masking
homogeneous parts, allowing the decoder to focus on representation with diverse
details while alleviating the computation burden for efficient inference.
Furthermore, we construct a localized binarization-aware mimicking framework
with the information-guided strategy, prompting matting-related representation
in full-precision counterparts to be accurately and fully utilized.
Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed BiVM surpasses alternative
binarized video matting networks, including state-of-the-art (SOTA)
binarization methods, by a substantial margin. Moreover, our BiVM achieves
significant savings of 14.3x and 21.6x in computation and storage costs,
respectively. We also evaluate BiVM on ARM CPU hardware.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of deep learning (DL) models and the ever-increasing size
of available datasets have raised the interest of the research community in the
always important field of vision-based hand gesture recognition (VHGR), and
delivered a wide range of applications, such as sign language understanding and
human-computer interaction using cameras. Despite the large volume of research
works in the field, a structured and complete survey on VHGR is still missing,
leaving researchers to navigate through hundreds of papers in order to find the
right combination of data, model, and approach for each task. The current
survey aims to fill this gap by presenting a comprehensive overview of this
aspect of computer vision. With a systematic research methodology that
identifies the state-of-the-art works and a structured presentation of the
various methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics, this review aims to
constitute a useful guideline for researchers, helping them to choose the right
strategy for delving into a certain VHGR task. Starting with the methodology
used for study selection, literature retrieval, and the analytical framing, the
survey identifies and organizes key VHGR approaches using a taxonomy-based
format in various dimensions such as input modality and application domain. The
core of the survey provides an in-depth analysis of state-of-the-art techniques
across three primary VHGR tasks: static gesture recognition, isolated dynamic
gestures and continuous gesture recognition. For each task, the architectural
trends and learning strategies are listed. Additionally, the study reviews
commonly used datasets - emphasizing on annotation schemes - and evaluates
standard performance metrics. It concludes by identifying major challenges in
VHGR, including both general computer vision issues and domain-specific
obstacles, and outlines promising directions for future research.

Result: 在风格保真度和提示保真度上表现优异，推理速度更快，部署更灵活。

Conclusion: 该方法为个性化图像生成提供了一种高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a training-free framework for style-personalized image generation
that controls content and style information during inference using a scale-wise
autoregressive model. Our method employs a three-path design--content, style,
and generation--each guided by a corresponding text prompt, enabling flexible
and efficient control over image semantics without any additional training. A
central contribution of this work is a step-wise and attention-wise
intervention analysis. Through systematic prompt and feature injection, we find
that early-to-middle generation steps play a pivotal role in shaping both
content and style, and that query features predominantly encode
content-specific information. Guided by these insights, we introduce two
targeted mechanisms: Key Stage Attention Sharing, which aligns content and
style during the semantically critical steps, and Adaptive Query Sharing, which
reinforces content semantics in later steps through similarity-aware query
blending. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive style fidelity and prompt fidelity compared to fine-tuned
baselines, while offering faster inference and greater deployment flexibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法在单一场景中回归相机位姿，泛化性和鲁棒性不足，MVL-Loc旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 结合预训练的视觉语言模型和多模态数据，利用自然语言指导多场景学习，增强语义理解和空间关系捕捉。

Result: 在7Scenes和Cambridge Landmarks数据集上表现出色，位姿估计精度提升。

Conclusion: MVL-Loc在多场景相机重定位中具有鲁棒性和先进性能。

Abstract: Camera relocalization, a cornerstone capability of modern computer vision,
accurately determines a camera's position and orientation (6-DoF) from images
and is essential for applications in augmented reality (AR), mixed reality
(MR), autonomous driving, delivery drones, and robotic navigation. Unlike
traditional deep learning-based methods that regress camera pose from images in
a single scene, which often lack generalization and robustness in diverse
environments, we propose MVL-Loc, a novel end-to-end multi-scene 6-DoF camera
relocalization framework. MVL-Loc leverages pretrained world knowledge from
vision-language models (VLMs) and incorporates multimodal data to generalize
across both indoor and outdoor settings. Furthermore, natural language is
employed as a directive tool to guide the multi-scene learning process,
facilitating semantic understanding of complex scenes and capturing spatial
relationships among objects. Extensive experiments on the 7Scenes and Cambridge
Landmarks datasets demonstrate MVL-Loc's robustness and state-of-the-art
performance in real-world multi-scene camera relocalization, with improved
accuracy in both positional and orientational estimates.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于CLIP的框架FA，通过强制提示学习充分利用ID知识，显著提升OOD检测效果，无需外部数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP方法依赖OOD相关知识或外部数据，泛化能力有限，FA旨在通过ID知识提升OOD检测。

Method: 学习一个强制提示，包含ID类的多样化描述，通过强制系数增强语义相似性，提升ID图像辨识。

Result: FA在OOD检测上显著优于现有方法，且无需外部数据，参数数量与CoOp相同。

Conclusion: FA通过ID知识优化OOD检测，具有高效性和普适性。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced out-of-distribution
(OOD) detection recently. However, existing CLIP-based methods often focus on
learning OOD-related knowledge to improve OOD detection, showing limited
generalization or reliance on external large-scale auxiliary datasets. In this
study, instead of delving into the intricate OOD-related knowledge, we propose
an innovative CLIP-based framework based on Forced prompt leArning (FA),
designed to make full use of the In-Distribution (ID) knowledge and ultimately
boost the effectiveness of OOD detection. Our key insight is to learn a prompt
(i.e., forced prompt) that contains more diversified and richer descriptions of
the ID classes beyond the textual semantics of class labels. Specifically, it
promotes better discernment for ID images, by forcing more notable semantic
similarity between ID images and the learnable forced prompt. Moreover, we
introduce a forced coefficient, encouraging the forced prompt to learn more
comprehensive and nuanced descriptions of the ID classes. In this way, FA is
capable of achieving notable improvements in OOD detection, even when trained
without any external auxiliary datasets, while maintaining an identical number
of trainable parameters as CoOp. Extensive empirical evaluations confirm our
method consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. Code is
available at https://github.com/0xFAFA/FA.

TL;DR: 提出了一种实时数据选择方法，通过对象级新颖性检测构建更平衡和多样化的数据集，解决了自动驾驶中数据冗余和罕见事件捕获不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据收集常偏向常见场景和对象，导致罕见事件代表性不足，影响模型泛化能力和安全性。

Method: 使用动态Mean Shift算法为图像帧分配数据驱动的新颖性评分，基于均值和协方差统计建模正常内容，识别并丢弃冗余帧。

Result: 减少训练数据集大小可提升模型性能，而数据冗余增加时，更激进的过滤方法更有效。方法支持实时部署（32帧/秒）。

Conclusion: 该方法通过动态更新正常内容定义，实现了连续数据流中新颖性的高效检测，为构建更平衡的数据集提供了可行方案。

Abstract: High-quality datasets are essential for training robust perception systems in
autonomous driving. However, real-world data collection is often biased toward
common scenes and objects, leaving novel cases underrepresented. This imbalance
hinders model generalization and compromises safety. The core issue is the
curse of rarity. Over time, novel events occur infrequently, and standard
logging methods fail to capture them effectively. As a result, large volumes of
redundant data are stored, while critical novel cases are diluted, leading to
biased datasets. This work presents a real-time data selection method focused
on object-level novelty detection to build more balanced and diverse datasets.
The method assigns a data-driven novelty score to image frames using a novel
dynamic Mean Shift algorithm. It models normal content based on mean and
covariance statistics to identify frames with novel objects, discarding those
with redundant elements. The main findings show that reducing the training
dataset size with this method can improve model performance, whereas higher
redundancy tends to degrade it. Moreover, as data redundancy increases, more
aggressive filtering becomes both possible and beneficial. While random
sampling can offer some gains, it often leads to overfitting and
unpredictability in outcomes. The proposed method supports real-time deployment
with 32 frames per second and is constant over time. By continuously updating
the definition of normal content, it enables efficient detection of novelties
in a continuous data stream.

Abstract: Discrete video tokenization is essential for efficient autoregressive
generative modeling due to the high dimensionality of video data. This work
introduces a state-of-the-art discrete video tokenizer with two key
contributions. First, we propose a novel Mamba-based encoder-decoder
architecture that overcomes the limitations of previous sequencebased
tokenizers. Second, we introduce a new quantization scheme, channel-split
quantization, which significantly enhances the representational power of
quantized latents while preserving the token count. Our model sets a new
state-of-the-art, outperforming both causal 3D convolutionbased and
Transformer-based approaches across multiple datasets. Experimental results
further demonstrate its robustness as a tokenizer for autoregressive video
generation.

Result: 实验表明S²Edit在定量和定性上优于现有方法，并支持多种图像编辑应用。

Conclusion: S²Edit通过语义解耦和空间聚焦的身份令牌，实现了精确的个性化编辑。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled high-quality generation and
manipulation of images guided by texts, as well as concept learning from
images. However, naive applications of existing methods to editing tasks that
require fine-grained control, e.g., face editing, often lead to suboptimal
solutions with identity information and high-frequency details lost during the
editing process, or irrelevant image regions altered due to entangled concepts.
In this work, we propose S$^2$Edit, a novel method based on a pre-trained
text-to-image diffusion model that enables personalized editing with precise
semantic and spatial control. We first fine-tune our model to embed the
identity information into a learnable text token. During fine-tuning, we
disentangle the learned identity token from attributes to be edited by
enforcing an orthogonality constraint in the textual feature space. To ensure
that the identity token only affects regions of interest, we apply object masks
to guide the cross-attention maps. At inference time, our method performs
localized editing while faithfully preserving the original identity with
semantically disentangled and spatially focused identity token learned.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of S$^2$Edit over
state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Additionally,
we showcase several compositional image editing applications of S$^2$Edit such
as makeup transfer.

Conclusion: CVFusion通过两阶段融合和多视图特征聚合，显著提升了4D雷达的3D物体检测性能。

Abstract: 4D radar has received significant attention in autonomous driving thanks to
its robustness under adverse weathers. Due to the sparse points and noisy
measurements of the 4D radar, most of the research finish the 3D object
detection task by integrating images from camera and perform modality fusion in
BEV space. However, the potential of the radar and the fusion mechanism is
still largely unexplored, hindering the performance improvement. In this study,
we propose a cross-view two-stage fusion network called CVFusion. In the first
stage, we design a radar guided iterative (RGIter) BEV fusion module to
generate high-recall 3D proposal boxes. In the second stage, we aggregate
features from multiple heterogeneous views including points, image, and BEV for
each proposal. These comprehensive instance level features greatly help refine
the proposals and generate high-quality predictions. Extensive experiments on
public datasets show that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art
methods by a large margin, with 9.10% and 3.68% mAP improvements on
View-of-Delft (VoD) and TJ4DRadSet, respectively. Our code will be made

Conclusion: VLM2Vec-V2为多模态嵌入学习提供了统一框架，为研究和实际应用中的可扩展表示学习奠定了基础。

Abstract: Multimodal embedding models have been crucial in enabling various downstream
tasks such as semantic similarity, information retrieval, and clustering over
different modalities. However, existing multimodal embeddings like VLM2Vec,
E5-V, GME are predominantly focused on natural images, with limited support for
other visual forms such as videos and visual documents. This restricts their
applicability in real-world scenarios, including AI agents, multi-modal search
and recommendation, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). To close this
gap, we propose VLM2Vec-V2, a unified framework for learning embeddings across
diverse visual forms. First, we introduce MMEB-V2, a comprehensive benchmark
that extends MMEB with five new task types: visual document retrieval, video
retrieval, temporal grounding, video classification and video question
answering - spanning text, image, video, and visual document inputs. Next, we
train VLM2Vec-V2, a general-purpose embedding model that supports text, image,
video, and visual document inputs. Extensive experiments show that VLM2Vec-V2
achieves strong performance not only on the newly introduced video and document
retrieval tasks, but also improves over prior baselines on the original image
benchmarks. Through extensive evaluation, our study offers insights into the
generalizability of various multimodal embedding models and highlights
effective strategies for unified embedding learning, laying the groundwork for
more scalable and adaptable representation learning in both research and
real-world settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在结合多个LoRA模型时，常因权重矩阵的非结构化修改导致内容与风格属性纠缠，影响效果。

Method: 利用QR分解，固定Q和R矩阵，仅训练额外的任务特定ΔR矩阵，实现参数高效和属性解耦。

Result: QR-LoRA在内容-风格融合任务中表现出优越的解耦性能，参数数量仅为传统LoRA方法的一半。

Conclusion: QR-LoRA为生成模型提供了一种参数高效且解耦的微调新范式。

Abstract: Existing text-to-image models often rely on parameter fine-tuning techniques
such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to customize visual attributes. However,
when combining multiple LoRA models for content-style fusion tasks,
unstructured modifications of weight matrices often lead to undesired feature
entanglement between content and style attributes. We propose QR-LoRA, a novel
fine-tuning framework leveraging QR decomposition for structured parameter
updates that effectively separate visual attributes. Our key insight is that
the orthogonal Q matrix naturally minimizes interference between different
visual features, while the upper triangular R matrix efficiently encodes
attribute-specific transformations. Our approach fixes both Q and R matrices
while only training an additional task-specific $\Delta R$ matrix. This
structured design reduces trainable parameters to half of conventional LoRA
methods and supports effective merging of multiple adaptations without
cross-contamination due to the strong disentanglement properties between
$\Delta R$ matrices. Experiments demonstrate that QR-LoRA achieves superior
disentanglement in content-style fusion tasks, establishing a new paradigm for
parameter-efficient, disentangled fine-tuning in generative models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为HiLa的分层视觉语言协作框架，通过多层级视觉特征和语言提示的优化对齐，改进了癌症生存预测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖稀疏的切片级标签和单一语言提示，无法充分学习WSI中的细粒度视觉-语言关联，且忽略了WSI的层次结构。

Method: HiLa框架结合预训练特征提取器生成分层视觉特征，并通过最优提示学习（OPL）与多属性语言提示对齐，同时引入跨层级传播（CLP）和互对比学习（MCL）模块优化层次协作。

Result: 在三个TCGA数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: HiLa框架通过分层视觉-语言协作显著提升了生存预测的准确性。

Abstract: Survival prediction using whole-slide images (WSIs) is crucial in cancer
re-search. Despite notable success, existing approaches are limited by their
reliance on sparse slide-level labels, which hinders the learning of
discriminative repre-sentations from gigapixel WSIs. Recently, vision language
(VL) models, which incorporate additional language supervision, have emerged as
a promising solu-tion. However, VL-based survival prediction remains largely
unexplored due to two key challenges. First, current methods often rely on only
one simple lan-guage prompt and basic cosine similarity, which fails to learn
fine-grained associ-ations between multi-faceted linguistic information and
visual features within WSI, resulting in inadequate vision-language alignment.
Second, these methods primarily exploit patch-level information, overlooking
the intrinsic hierarchy of WSIs and their interactions, causing ineffective
modeling of hierarchical interac-tions. To tackle these problems, we propose a
novel Hierarchical vision-Language collaboration (HiLa) framework for improved
survival prediction. Specifically, HiLa employs pretrained feature extractors
to generate hierarchical visual features from WSIs at both patch and region
levels. At each level, a series of language prompts describing various
survival-related attributes are constructed and aligned with visual features
via Optimal Prompt Learning (OPL). This ap-proach enables the comprehensive
learning of discriminative visual features cor-responding to different
survival-related attributes from prompts, thereby improv-ing vision-language
alignment. Furthermore, we introduce two modules, i.e., Cross-Level Propagation
(CLP) and Mutual Contrastive Learning (MCL) to maximize hierarchical
cooperation by promoting interactions and consistency be-tween patch and region

Abstract: 3D Visual Question Answering (3D VQA) is crucial for enabling models to
perceive the physical world and perform spatial reasoning. In 3D VQA, the
free-form nature of answers often leads to improper annotations that can
confuse or mislead models when training on the entire dataset. While other text
generation tasks can mitigate this issue by learning on large-scale datasets,
the scarcity of 3D scene data enlarges the negative effect of misleading
annotations. Although active learning strategies can select valuable instances
for training, they fail to identify and resolve misleading labels, which the
oracle inevitably provides in practice. To address this issue, we propose a
multi-turn interactive active learning strategy. This strategy selects data
based on models' semantic uncertainty to form a solid knowledge foundation more
effectively and actively requests reannotation from an oracle to resolve
potentially misleading labels. For uncertainty assessment, we utilize a
variance-based metric that takes semantic relationships between terms into
consideration, thus avoiding the uniform inter-class similarity assumption of
previous assessment metrics. Extensive experiments exhibit better model
performance and a substantial reduction in training costs, with a halving of
training costs for achieving relatively high accuracy. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出LTMSformer框架，通过局部趋势感知注意力机制和运动状态编码器，改进多模态轨迹预测的时空依赖性建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究常忽视局部时间依赖性和高阶运动状态属性，导致轨迹预测效果不佳。

Method: 使用局部趋势感知注意力机制捕捉时间依赖，运动状态编码器建模空间交互，轻量级提案细化模块优化预测。

Result: 在Argoverse 1数据集上，性能优于基线HiVT-64，minADE降低4.35%，minFDE降低8.74%，MR降低20%。

Conclusion: LTMSformer在减少模型规模的同时提高了预测精度，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: It has been challenging to model the complex temporal-spatial dependencies
between agents for trajectory prediction. As each state of an agent is closely
related to the states of adjacent time steps, capturing the local temporal
dependency is beneficial for prediction, while most studies often overlook it.
Besides, learning the high-order motion state attributes is expected to enhance
spatial interaction modeling, but it is rarely seen in previous works. To
address this, we propose a lightweight framework, LTMSformer, to extract
temporal-spatial interaction features for multi-modal trajectory prediction.
Specifically, we introduce a Local Trend-Aware Attention mechanism to capture
the local temporal dependency by leveraging a convolutional attention mechanism
with hierarchical local time boxes. Next, to model the spatial interaction
dependency, we build a Motion State Encoder to incorporate high-order motion
state attributes, such as acceleration, jerk, heading, etc. To further refine
the trajectory prediction, we propose a Lightweight Proposal Refinement Module
that leverages Multi-Layer Perceptrons for trajectory embedding and generates
the refined trajectories with fewer model parameters. Experiment results on the
Argoverse 1 dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline
HiVT-64, reducing the minADE by approximately 4.35%, the minFDE by 8.74%, and
the MR by 20%. We also achieve higher accuracy than HiVT-128 with a 68%
reduction in model size.

Result: 在21个基准数据集上的实验验证了MODA在感知、认知和情感任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: MODA通过改进注意力机制，显著提升了多模态大语言模型在复杂任务中的表现。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) recently showed strong capacity in
integrating data among multiple modalities, empowered by a generalizable
attention architecture. Advanced methods predominantly focus on
language-centric tuning while less exploring multimodal tokens mixed through
attention, posing challenges in high-level tasks that require fine-grained
cognition and emotion understanding. In this work, we identify the attention
deficit disorder problem in multimodal learning, caused by inconsistent
cross-modal attention and layer-by-layer decayed attention activation. To
address this, we propose a novel attention mechanism, termed MOdular Duplex
Attention (MODA), simultaneously conducting the inner-modal refinement and
inter-modal interaction. MODA employs a correct-after-align strategy to
effectively decouple modality alignment from cross-layer token mixing. In the
alignment phase, tokens are mapped to duplex modality spaces based on the basis
vectors, enabling the interaction between visual and language modality.
Further, the correctness of attention scores is ensured through adaptive masked
attention, which enhances the model's flexibility by allowing customizable
masking patterns for different modalities. Extensive experiments on 21
benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of MODA in perception, cognition,
and emotion tasks. Source code and demo are available in

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注识别性能提升，但忽略了由固有缺陷（如模态内噪声和模态间冲突）引起的不确定性，这在细粒度局部遮挡和帧丢失情况下尤为显著。

Method: UGG-ReID采用高斯补丁图表示模型量化局部线索并捕捉其结构关系，同时设计不确定性引导的专家混合策略动态路由样本。

Conclusion: UGG-ReID通过不确定性建模和多模态交互增强，显著提升了多模态对象重识别的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Multi-modal object Re-IDentification (ReID) has gained considerable attention
with the goal of retrieving specific targets across cameras using heterogeneous
visual data sources. Existing methods primarily aim to improve identification
performance, but often overlook the uncertainty arising from inherent defects,
such as intra-modal noise and inter-modal conflicts. This uncertainty is
particularly significant in the case of fine-grained local occlusion and frame
loss, which becomes a challenge in multi-modal learning. To address the above
challenge, we propose a robust approach named Uncertainty-Guided Graph model
for multi-modal object ReID (UGG-ReID). UGG-ReID is designed to mitigate noise
interference and facilitate effective multi-modal fusion by estimating both
local and sample-level aleatoric uncertainty and explicitly modeling their
dependencies. Specifically, we first propose the Gaussian patch-graph
representation model that leverages uncertainty to quantify fine-grained local
cues and capture their structural relationships. This process boosts the
expressiveness of modal-specific information, ensuring that the generated
embeddings are both more informative and robust. Subsequently, we design an
uncertainty-guided mixture of experts strategy that dynamically routes samples
to experts exhibiting low uncertainty. This strategy effectively suppresses
noise-induced instability, leading to enhanced robustness. Meanwhile, we design
an uncertainty-guided routing to strengthen the multi-modal interaction,
improving the performance. UGG-ReID is comprehensively evaluated on five
representative multi-modal object ReID datasets, encompassing diverse spectral
modalities. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves
excellent performance on all datasets and is significantly better than current
methods in terms of noise immunity. Our code will be made public upon
acceptance.

Abstract: Automatically extracting vectorized building contours from remote sensing
imagery is crucial for urban planning, population estimation, and disaster
assessment. Current state-of-the-art methods rely on complex multi-stage
pipelines involving pixel segmentation, vectorization, and polygon refinement,
which limits their scalability and real-world applicability. Inspired by the
remarkable reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce
VectorLLM, the first Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) designed for
regular building contour extraction from remote sensing images. Unlike existing
approaches, VectorLLM performs corner-point by corner-point regression of
building contours directly, mimicking human annotators' labeling process. Our
architecture consists of a vision foundation backbone, an MLP connector, and an
LLM, enhanced with learnable position embeddings to improve spatial
understanding capability. Through comprehensive exploration of training
strategies including pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and preference
optimization across WHU, WHU-Mix, and CrowdAI datasets, VectorLLM significantly
outperformed the previous SOTA methods by 5.6 AP, 7.1 AP, 13.6 AP, respectively
in the three datasets. Remarkably, VectorLLM exhibits strong zero-shot
performance on unseen objects including aircraft, water bodies, and oil tanks,
highlighting its potential for unified modeling of diverse remote sensing
object contour extraction tasks. Overall, this work establishes a new paradigm
for vector extraction in remote sensing, leveraging the topological reasoning
capabilities of LLMs to achieve both high accuracy and exceptional
generalization. All the codes and weights will be published for promoting
community development.

TL;DR: AVATAR是一个视频为中心的音频-视觉定位（AVL）基准，引入四种场景，并提出了TAVLO模型，通过高分辨率时间建模实现精确对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究仅关注图像级音频-视觉关联，忽略时间动态，且假设场景过于简化（如单一可见声源）。

Method: 提出AVATAR基准和TAVLO模型，整合高分辨率时间信息，支持四种复杂场景。

Result: 传统方法因依赖全局音频特征和帧级映射难以跟踪时间变化，而TAVLO表现更优。

Conclusion: 时间动态对AVL至关重要，AVATAR和TAVLO为视频中心AVL设定了新标准。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Localization (AVL) aims to identify sound-emitting sources
within a visual scene. However, existing studies focus on image-level
audio-visual associations, failing to capture temporal dynamics. Moreover, they
assume simplified scenarios where sound sources are always visible and involve
only a single object. To address these limitations, we propose AVATAR, a
video-centric AVL benchmark that incorporates high-resolution temporal
information. AVATAR introduces four distinct scenarios -- Single-sound,
Mixed-sound, Multi-entity, and Off-screen -- enabling a more comprehensive
evaluation of AVL models. Additionally, we present TAVLO, a novel video-centric
AVL model that explicitly integrates temporal information. Experimental results
show that conventional methods struggle to track temporal variations due to
their reliance on global audio features and frame-level mappings. In contrast,
TAVLO achieves robust and precise audio-visual alignment by leveraging
high-resolution temporal modeling. Our work empirically demonstrates the
importance of temporal dynamics in AVL and establishes a new standard for
video-centric audio-visual localization.

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative methods, especially diffusion models, have
made great progress in remote sensing image synthesis. Despite these
advancements, existing methods have not explored the simulation of future
scenarios based on given scenario images. This simulation capability has wide
applications for urban planning, land managementChangeBridge: Spatiotemporal
Image Generation with Multimodal Controls, and beyond. In this work, we propose
ChangeBridge, a conditional spatiotemporal diffusion model. Given pre-event
images and conditioned on multimodal spatial controls (e.g., text prompts,
instance layouts, and semantic maps), ChangeBridge can synthesize post-event
images. The core idea behind ChangeBridge is to modeling the noise-to-image
diffusion model, as a pre-to-post diffusion bridge. Conditioned on multimodal
controls, ChangeBridge leverages a stochastic Brownian-bridge diffusion,
directly modeling the spatiotemporal evolution between pre-event and post-event
states. To the best of our knowledge, ChangeBridge is the first spatiotemporal
generative model with multimodal controls for remote sensing. Experimental
results demonstrate that ChangeBridge can simulate high-fidelity future
scenarios aligned with given conditions, including event and event-driven
background variations. Code will be available.

Abstract: Digital orthodontics represents a prominent and critical application of
computer vision technology in the medical field. So far, the labor-intensive
process of collecting clinical data, particularly in acquiring paired 3D
orthodontic teeth models, constitutes a crucial bottleneck for developing tooth
arrangement neural networks. Although numerous general 3D shape generation
methods have been proposed, most of them focus on single-object generation and
are insufficient for generating anatomically structured teeth models, each
comprising 24-32 segmented teeth. In this paper, we propose TeethGenerator, a
novel two-stage framework designed to synthesize paired 3D teeth models pre-
and post-orthodontic, aiming to facilitate the training of downstream tooth
arrangement networks. Specifically, our approach consists of two key modules:
(1) a teeth shape generation module that leverages a diffusion model to learn
the distribution of morphological characteristics of teeth, enabling the
generation of diverse post-orthodontic teeth models; and (2) a teeth style
generation module that synthesizes corresponding pre-orthodontic teeth models
by incorporating desired styles as conditional inputs. Extensive qualitative
and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our synthetic dataset aligns
closely with the distribution of real orthodontic data, and promotes tooth
alignment performance significantly when combined with real data for training.

Abstract: We present a diffusion-based portrait shadow removal approach that can
robustly produce high-fidelity results. Unlike previous methods, we cast shadow
removal as diffusion-based inpainting. To this end, we first train a
shadow-independent structure extraction network on a real-world portrait
dataset with various synthetic lighting conditions, which allows to generate a
shadow-independent structure map including facial details while excluding the
unwanted shadow boundaries. The structure map is then used as condition to
train a structure-guided inpainting diffusion model for removing shadows in a
generative manner. Finally, to restore the fine-scale details (e.g., eyelashes,
moles and spots) that may not be captured by the structure map, we take the
gradients inside the shadow regions as guidance and train a detail restoration
diffusion model to refine the shadow removal result. Extensive experiments on
the benchmark datasets show that our method clearly outperforms existing
methods, and is effective to avoid previously common issues such as facial
identity tampering, shadow residual, color distortion, structure blurring, and
loss of details. Our code is available at

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) often struggle with compositional reasoning due
to insufficient high-quality image-text data. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a novel block-based diffusion approach that automatically generates
counterfactual datasets without manual annotation. Our method utilizes large
language models to identify entities and their spatial relationships. It then
independently generates image blocks as "puzzle pieces" coherently arranged
according to specified compositional rules. This process creates diverse,
high-fidelity counterfactual image-text pairs with precisely controlled
variations. In addition, we introduce a specialized loss function that
differentiates inter-set from intra-set samples, enhancing training efficiency
and reducing the need for negative samples. Experiments demonstrate that
fine-tuning VLMs with our counterfactual datasets significantly improves visual
reasoning performance. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results across
multiple benchmarks while using substantially less training data than existing
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频时间定位任务因视频信息量大且冗余而具有挑战性，需模型全面理解视频以准确检索相关片段。

Method: 采用自适应注意力分配（SAA）和显式时间戳对齐（ETA）预处理方法，微调阶段引入部分无关拒绝策略（PIR-GRPO）增强时间推理。

Result: 在QVHighlights测试集上表现优于现有技术约3.5%。

Conclusion: Tempo-R0通过多模态时间感知增强显著提升了视频时间定位任务的性能。

Abstract: Temporal Video Grounding (TVG), which requires pinpointing relevant temporal
segments from video based on language query, has always been a highly
challenging task in the field of video understanding. Videos often have a
larger volume of information and redundancy than texts or images. Models should
present comprehensive understanding of the whole video to accurately retrieve
query-relevant clips. We thus propose Tempo-R0: a Video Multimodal Large
Language Model (Video-MLLM) for the temporal video grounding task via
multimodal temporal sensing reinforcement. Specifically, during the
preprocessing stage of our pipeline, we employ Self-adaptive Attention
Allocation (SAA) method based on frame content variation to efficiently use the
MLLM's limited attention. The Explicit Timestamp-modal Aligned (ETA) method is
also utilized to strengthen our model's capability to perceive the boundaries
of events in the video. In the fine-tuning part of our pipeline, we creatively
apply Partial Irrelevance Refusing-based Group Relative Policy Optimization
(PIR-GRPO) in TVG area to foster model's temporal reasoning from not only
accepting relevant video-query pairs but also refusing irrelevant ones.
Experiments demonstrate that our method accomplishes a notable advantage over
SOTA solutions by around 3.5% on both the original QVHighlights testbench and
its corrected version with more reasonable ground truth annotations.

Abstract: Identity-preserving text-to-video (IPT2V) generation, which aims to create
high-fidelity videos with consistent human identity, has become crucial for
downstream applications. However, current end-to-end frameworks suffer a
critical spatial-temporal trade-off: optimizing for spatially coherent layouts
of key elements (e.g., character identity preservation) often compromises
instruction-compliant temporal smoothness, while prioritizing dynamic realism
risks disrupting the spatial coherence of visual structures. To tackle this
issue, we propose a simple yet effective spatial-temporal decoupled framework
that decomposes representations into spatial features for layouts and temporal
features for motion dynamics. Specifically, our paper proposes a semantic
prompt optimization mechanism and stage-wise decoupled generation paradigm. The
former module decouples the prompt into spatial and temporal components.
Aligned with the subsequent stage-wise decoupled approach, the spatial prompts
guide the text-to-image (T2I) stage to generate coherent spatial features,
while the temporal prompts direct the sequential image-to-video (I2V) stage to
ensure motion consistency. Experimental results validate that our approach
achieves excellent spatiotemporal consistency, demonstrating outstanding
performance in identity preservation, text relevance, and video quality. By
leveraging this simple yet robust mechanism, our algorithm secures the
runner-up position in 2025 ACM MultiMedia Challenge.

Motivation: 牙科标志点的手动标注耗时且存在观察者间差异，传统深度学习方法因数据稀缺和高标注成本受限。

Method: 结合Sapiens基础模型和新型几何损失函数，优化解剖结构的几何关系捕捉能力。

Result: 在严格0.5 mm阈值下，GeoSapiens的检测成功率比现有方法高8.18%。

Conclusion: GeoSapiens为牙科标志点检测提供了一种高效、稳健的解决方案，尤其适用于数据稀缺场景。

Abstract: Accurate detection of anatomic landmarks is essential for assessing alveolar
bone and root conditions, thereby optimizing clinical outcomes in orthodontics,
periodontics, and implant dentistry. Manual annotation of landmarks on
cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) by dentists is time-consuming,
labor-intensive, and subject to inter-observer variability. Deep learning-based
automated methods present a promising approach to streamline this process
efficiently. However, the scarcity of training data and the high cost of expert
annotations hinder the adoption of conventional deep learning techniques. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce GeoSapiens, a novel few-shot learning
framework designed for robust dental landmark detection using limited annotated
CBCT of anterior teeth. Our GeoSapiens framework comprises two key components:
(1) a robust baseline adapted from Sapiens, a foundational model that has
achieved state-of-the-art performance in human-centric vision tasks, and (2) a
novel geometric loss function that improves the model's capacity to capture
critical geometric relationships among anatomical structures. Experiments
conducted on our collected dataset of anterior teeth landmarks revealed that
GeoSapiens surpassed existing landmark detection methods, outperforming the
leading approach by an 8.18% higher success detection rate at a strict 0.5 mm
threshold-a standard widely recognized in dental diagnostics. Code is available

TL;DR: 提出NC-GCD框架，通过固定ETF原型和一致性对齐损失，解决GCD中优化目标不一致和类别混淆问题，显著提升新类别分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GCD方法因优化目标不一致和类别混淆导致特征重叠，影响新类别分类性能。

Method: 预分配并固定ETF原型，引入一致性ETF对齐损失和语义一致性匹配器（SCM），确保几何结构最优和标签分配稳定。

Result: 在多个GCD基准测试中表现优异，显著提升新类别分类准确率。

Conclusion: NC-GCD框架有效解决了GCD中的关键问题，提升了新类别的发现和分类性能。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) focuses on classifying known categories
while simultaneously discovering novel categories from unlabeled data. However,
previous GCD methods face challenges due to inconsistent optimization
objectives and category confusion. This leads to feature overlap and ultimately
hinders performance on novel categories. To address these issues, we propose
the Neural Collapse-inspired Generalized Category Discovery (NC-GCD) framework.
By pre-assigning and fixing Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) prototypes, our
method ensures an optimal geometric structure and a consistent optimization
objective for both known and novel categories. We introduce a Consistent ETF
Alignment Loss that unifies supervised and unsupervised ETF alignment and
enhances category separability. Additionally, a Semantic Consistency Matcher
(SCM) is designed to maintain stable and consistent label assignments across
clustering iterations. Our method achieves strong performance on multiple GCD
benchmarks, significantly enhancing novel category accuracy and demonstrating
its effectiveness.

### [189] [Losing Control: Data Poisoning Attack on Guided Diffusion via ControlNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04726)
*Raz Lapid,Almog Dubin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对ControlNets的数据投毒攻击方法，能够在无文本触发的情况下生成特定内容（如NSFW图像），揭示了开源ControlNets管道的安全漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ControlNets依赖公开数据集和社区共享数据进行微调，容易受到隐蔽的数据投毒攻击。

Method: 通过注入带有微妙触发的毒化样本（输入与NSFW目标配对），使模型在触发时生成NSFW内容，同时保持正常提示的保真度。

Result: 在大规模高质量数据集上，攻击成功率高且输入中的触发器难以察觉。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了ControlNets的严重漏洞，强调了数据净化和防御机制的重要性。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in
translating textual prompts into high-fidelity images. ControlNets further
extend these models by allowing precise, image-based conditioning (e.g., edge
maps, depth, pose), enabling fine-grained control over structure and style.
However, their dependence on large, publicly scraped datasets -- and the
increasing use of community-shared data for fine-tuning -- exposes them to
stealthy data poisoning attacks. In this work, we introduce a novel data
poisoning method that manipulates ControlNets to generate images containing
specific content without any text triggers. By injecting poisoned samples --
each pairing a subtly triggered input with an NSFW target -- the model retains
clean-prompt fidelity yet reliably produces NSFW outputs when the trigger is
present. On large-scale, high-quality datasets, our backdoor achieves high
attack success rate while remaining imperceptible in raw inputs. These results
reveal a critical vulnerability in open-source ControlNets pipelines and
underscore the need for robust data sanitization and defense mechanisms.

*Francesco Giuliari,Asif Khan Pattan,Mohamed Lamine Mekhalfi,Fabio Poiesi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究了视觉语言模型（VLMs）在零样本文本到图像检索中的应用，特别是在织物样本领域。通过自动标注管道生成两种文本描述，评估了三种模型的检索性能，发现结构化描述显著提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨模态检索在制造业等专业领域至关重要，但缺乏公开数据集。研究旨在探索VLMs在零样本检索中的表现，并解决数据标注问题。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）自动生成自由形式和结构化文本描述，评估CLIP、LAION-CLIP和Meta的Perception Encoder三种模型。

Result: 结构化描述显著提升检索准确性，Perception Encoder表现最佳，但零样本检索在细粒度领域仍具挑战性。

Conclusion: 结合技术性文本描述和先进VLMs可优化工业应用中的跨模态检索，需进一步开发领域适应方法。

Abstract: Effective cross-modal retrieval is essential for applications like
information retrieval and recommendation systems, particularly in specialized
domains such as manufacturing, where product information often consists of
visual samples paired with a textual description. This paper investigates the
use of Vision Language Models(VLMs) for zero-shot text-to-image retrieval on
fabric samples. We address the lack of publicly available datasets by
introducing an automated annotation pipeline that uses Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) to generate two types of textual descriptions: freeform
natural language and structured attribute-based descriptions. We produce these
descriptions to evaluate retrieval performance across three Vision-Language
Models: CLIP, LAION-CLIP, and Meta's Perception Encoder. Our experiments
demonstrate that structured, attribute-rich descriptions significantly enhance
retrieval accuracy, particularly for visually complex fabric classes, with the
Perception Encoder outperforming other models due to its robust feature
alignment capabilities. However, zero-shot retrieval remains challenging in
this fine-grained domain, underscoring the need for domain-adapted approaches.
Our findings highlight the importance of combining technical textual
descriptions with advanced VLMs to optimize cross-modal retrieval in industrial
applications.

TL;DR: SalBench是一个新基准，用于评估大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）在检测人类明显视觉特征（如颜色、强度、方向等）上的能力。研究发现，LVLM在识别明显视觉异常时表现不佳，GPT-4o准确率仅为47.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LVLM在低层次视觉特征上的能力，以衡量其与人类视觉注意力的对齐程度。

Method: SalBench包含三个任务：Odd-One-Out Detection、Referring Odd-One-Out和Visual Referring Odd-One-Out，用于测试LVLM的感知能力。

Result: LVLM在识别明显视觉异常时表现较差，GPT-4o准确率仅为47.6%。

Conclusion: SalBench是衡量LVLM与人类视觉注意力对齐能力的重要工具。

Abstract: We present Saliency Benchmark (SalBench), a novel benchmark designed to
assess the capability of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLM) in detecting
visually salient features that are readily apparent to humans, such as a large
circle amidst a grid of smaller ones. This benchmark focuses on low-level
features including color, intensity, and orientation, which are fundamental to
human visual processing. Our SalBench consists of images that highlight rare,
unusual, or unexpected elements within scenes, and naturally draw human
attention. It comprises three novel tasks for evaluating the perceptual
capabilities of LVLM: Odd-One-Out Detection, Referring Odd-One-Out, and Visual
Referring Odd-One-Out. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art LVLM using SalBench and our findings reveal a surprising
limitation: LVLM struggle to identify seemingly obvious visual anomalies, with
even the advanced GPT-4o achieving only 47.6\% accuracy on such a simple task.
SalBench will be an important step in measuring the capabilities of LVLM that
align with the subtle definition of human attention.

TL;DR: MatDecompSDF是一种新框架，用于从多视角图像中恢复高保真3D形状并分解其基于物理的材料属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 逆向渲染的核心挑战是从2D观测中解耦几何、材料和光照。

Method: 通过联合优化三个神经组件：神经SDF表示几何、神经场预测PBR材料参数、MLP模型捕捉环境光照，结合物理可微渲染层和设计先验进行优化。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上表现优于现有方法，提供可编辑和可重照明的资产。

Conclusion: MatDecompSDF在几何精度、材料保真度和实用性方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: We present MatDecompSDF, a novel framework for recovering high-fidelity 3D
shapes and decomposing their physically-based material properties from
multi-view images. The core challenge of inverse rendering lies in the
ill-posed disentanglement of geometry, materials, and illumination from 2D
observations. Our method addresses this by jointly optimizing three neural
components: a neural Signed Distance Function (SDF) to represent complex
geometry, a spatially-varying neural field for predicting PBR material
parameters (albedo, roughness, metallic), and an MLP-based model for capturing
unknown environmental lighting. The key to our approach is a physically-based
differentiable rendering layer that connects these 3D properties to the input
images, allowing for end-to-end optimization. We introduce a set of carefully
designed physical priors and geometric regularizations, including a material
smoothness loss and an Eikonal loss, to effectively constrain the problem and
achieve robust decomposition. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and
real-world datasets (e.g., DTU) demonstrate that MatDecompSDF surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in geometric accuracy, material fidelity, and novel
view synthesis. Crucially, our method produces editable and relightable assets
that can be seamlessly integrated into standard graphics pipelines, validating
its practical utility for digital content creation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PIV研究中缺乏对光学流模型的全面评估，主要由于数据集不足和标准化基准缺失，阻碍了进展。

Method: 通过CFD模拟生成大规模合成PIV数据集，并提出MCFormer网络架构，利用多帧时序信息和多成本体积。

Result: MCFormer在标准化评估中表现最佳，显著优于现有方法，达到最低的归一化端点误差（NEPE）。

Conclusion: 该研究为PIV领域提供了基准资源和先进方法，推动了未来研究的进展。

Abstract: Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is fundamental to fluid dynamics, yet deep
learning applications face significant hurdles. A critical gap exists: the lack
of comprehensive evaluation of how diverse optical flow models perform
specifically on PIV data, largely due to limitations in available datasets and
the absence of a standardized benchmark. This prevents fair comparison and
hinders progress. To address this, our primary contribution is a novel,
large-scale synthetic PIV benchmark dataset generated from diverse CFD
simulations (JHTDB and Blasius). It features unprecedented variety in particle
densities, flow velocities, and continuous motion, enabling, for the first
time, a standardized and rigorous evaluation of various optical flow and PIV
algorithms. Complementing this, we propose Multi Cost Volume PIV (MCFormer), a
new deep network architecture leveraging multi-frame temporal information and
multiple cost volumes, specifically designed for PIV's sparse nature. Our
comprehensive benchmark evaluation, the first of its kind, reveals significant
performance variations among adapted optical flow models and demonstrates that
MCFormer significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving the lowest
overall normalized endpoint error (NEPE). This work provides both a
foundational benchmark resource essential for future PIV research and a
state-of-the-art method tailored for PIV challenges. We make our benchmark
dataset and code publicly available to foster future research in this area.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于最小二乘图的多智能体3D LiDAR场景对抗噪声缓解框架，显著提升了对抗条件下的跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EdgeAI系统（如自动驾驶车辆）需要具备对抗威胁的鲁棒性，单智能体跟踪缺乏情境感知，多智能体合作能提升上下文理解和鲁棒性。

Method: 利用最小二乘图工具，通过差分坐标和锚点减少检测质心的位置误差，融合多车辆检测并分两阶段进行跟踪。

Result: 在V2V4Real数据集上，该方法比现有单/多智能体跟踪框架性能提升高达23.3%。

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外防御机制，即可作为对抗威胁的鲁棒解决方案。

Abstract: The critical perception capabilities of EdgeAI systems, such as autonomous
vehicles, are required to be resilient against adversarial threats, by enabling
accurate identification and localization of multiple objects in the scene over
time, mitigating their impact. Single-agent tracking offers resilience to
adversarial attacks but lacks situational awareness, underscoring the need for
multi-agent cooperation to enhance context understanding and robustness. This
paper proposes a novel mitigation framework on 3D LiDAR scene against
adversarial noise by tracking objects based on least-squares graph on
multi-agent adversarial bounding boxes. Specifically, we employ the
least-squares graph tool to reduce the induced positional error of each
detection's centroid utilizing overlapped bounding boxes on a fully connected
graph via differential coordinates and anchor points. Hence, the multi-vehicle
detections are fused and refined mitigating the adversarial impact, and
associated with existing tracks in two stages performing tracking to further
suppress the adversarial threat. An extensive evaluation study on the
real-world V2V4Real dataset demonstrates that the proposed method significantly
outperforms both state-of-the-art single and multi-agent tracking frameworks by
up to 23.3% under challenging adversarial conditions, operating as a resilient
approach without relying on additional defense mechanisms.

TL;DR: GraphBrep提出了一种显式表示和学习紧凑拓扑的B-Rep生成模型，通过图扩散模型学习拓扑，显著降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法中几何特征隐含拓扑信息导致冗余和计算成本高的问题。

Method: 构建无向加权图表示表面拓扑，利用图扩散模型学习拓扑，基于表面特征确定原始表面间的连接性。

Result: 在两个大规模无条件数据集和一个类别条件数据集上，训练和推理时间分别减少31.3%和56.3%，同时保持高质量CAD生成。

Conclusion: GraphBrep通过显式表示拓扑，有效降低了计算成本，同时保持了生成质量。

Abstract: Direct B-Rep generation is increasingly important in CAD workflows,
eliminating costly modeling sequence data and supporting complex features. A
key challenge is modeling joint distribution of the misaligned geometry and
topology. Existing methods tend to implicitly embed topology into the geometric
features of edges. Although this integration ensures feature alignment, it also
causes edge geometry to carry more redundant structural information compared to
the original B-Rep, leading to significantly higher computational cost. To
reduce redundancy, we propose GraphBrep, a B-Rep generation model that
explicitly represents and learns compact topology. Following the original
structure of B-Rep, we construct an undirected weighted graph to represent
surface topology. A graph diffusion model is employed to learn topology
conditioned on surface features, serving as the basis for determining
connectivity between primitive surfaces. The explicit representation ensures a
compact data structure, effectively reducing computational cost during both
training and inference. Experiments on two large-scale unconditional datasets
and one category-conditional dataset demonstrate the proposed method
significantly reduces training and inference times (up to 31.3% and 56.3% for
given datasets, respectively) while maintaining high-quality CAD generation
compared with SOTA.

Method: 通过法律案例分析，提出三个艺术风格判定标准，并开发ArtBulb框架，结合多模态聚类和MLLM。

Result: ArtBulb在定量和定性评估中优于现有模型，AICD数据集为AI艺术版权提供基准。

Conclusion: 研究旨在弥合法律与技术社区间的鸿沟，提升对AI艺术版权社会问题的关注。

Abstract: Current legal frameworks consider AI-generated works eligible for copyright
protection when they meet originality requirements and involve substantial
human intellectual input. However, systematic legal standards and reliable
evaluation methods for AI art copyrights are lacking. Through comprehensive
analysis of legal precedents, we establish three essential criteria for
determining distinctive artistic style: stylistic consistency, creative
uniqueness, and expressive accuracy. To address these challenges, we introduce
ArtBulb, an interpretable and quantifiable framework for AI art copyright
judgment that combines a novel style description-based multimodal clustering
method with multimodal large language models (MLLMs). We also present AICD, the
first benchmark dataset for AI art copyright annotated by artists and legal
experts. Experimental results demonstrate that ArtBulb outperforms existing
models in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Our work aims to
bridge the gap between the legal and technological communities and bring
greater attention to the societal issue of AI art copyrights.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为渐进式通道剪枝（PCP）的框架，通过迭代剪枝少量通道来加速卷积神经网络（CNN），优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通道剪枝方法通常逐层一次性剪枝，可能导致精度下降较大。PCP旨在通过渐进式剪枝减少精度损失。

Method: PCP采用三步流程（尝试-选择-剪枝）迭代剪枝：1）尝试剪枝并估计精度下降；2）基于精度下降选择剪枝层；3）剪枝少量通道。还扩展至迁移学习场景。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的实验表明，PCP在监督学习和迁移学习设置下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PCP通过渐进式剪枝有效减少精度损失，适用于多种学习场景，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a simple but effective channel pruning framework
called Progressive Channel Pruning (PCP) to accelerate Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs). In contrast to the existing channel pruning methods that prune
channels only once per layer in a layer-by-layer fashion, our new progressive
framework iteratively prunes a small number of channels from several selected
layers, which consists of a three-step attempting-selecting-pruning pipeline in
each iteration. In the attempting step, we attempt to prune a pre-defined
number of channels from one layer by using any existing channel pruning methods
and estimate the accuracy drop for this layer based on the labelled samples in
the validation set. In the selecting step, based on the estimated accuracy
drops for all layers, we propose a greedy strategy to automatically select a
set of layers that will lead to less overall accuracy drop after pruning these
layers. In the pruning step, we prune a small number of channels from these
selected layers. We further extend our PCP framework to prune channels for the
deep transfer learning methods like Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN),
in which we effectively reduce the data distribution mismatch in the channel
pruning process by using both labelled samples from the source domain and
pseudo-labelled samples from the target domain. Our comprehensive experiments
on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our PCP framework outperforms the
existing channel pruning approaches under both supervised learning and transfer
learning settings.

Result: 实验验证了该方法在多种下游任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: PointGAC通过聚类中心对齐策略，提升了特征学习的通用性和效率。

Abstract: Most masked point cloud modeling (MPM) methods follow a regression paradigm
to reconstruct the coordinate or feature of masked regions. However, they tend
to over-constrain the model to learn the details of the masked region,
resulting in failure to capture generalized features. To address this
limitation, we propose \textbf{\textit{PointGAC}}, a novel clustering-based MPM
method that aims to align the feature distribution of masked regions.
Specially, it features an online codebook-guided teacher-student framework.
Firstly, it presents a geometry-aware partitioning strategy to extract initial
patches. Then, the teacher model updates a codebook via online k-means based on
features extracted from the complete patches. This procedure facilitates
codebook vectors to become cluster centers. Afterward, we assigns the unmasked
features to their corresponding cluster centers, and the student model aligns
the assignment for the reconstructed masked features. This strategy focuses on
identifying the cluster centers to which the masked features belong, enabling
the model to learn more generalized feature representations. Benefiting from a
proposed codebook maintenance mechanism, codebook vectors are actively updated,
which further increases the efficiency of semantic feature learning.
Experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on various
downstream tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/LAB123-tech/PointGAC

Motivation: 解决主流姿态基自动化GMA方法因数据质量低和姿态估计噪声导致的不确定性问题。

Result: 在Pmi-GMA基准数据集上验证了模型在预测不良运动模式方面的有效性和泛化性。

Conclusion: UDF-GMA通过显式建模不确定性，显著提升了自动化GMA的临床可靠性。

Abstract: General movement assessment (GMA) is a non-invasive tool for the early
detection of brain dysfunction through the qualitative assessment of general
movements, and the development of automated methods can broaden its
application. However, mainstream pose-based automated GMA methods are prone to
uncertainty due to limited high-quality data and noisy pose estimation,
hindering clinical reliability without reliable uncertainty measures. In this
work, we introduce UDF-GMA which explicitly models epistemic uncertainty in
model parameters and aleatoric uncertainty from data noise for pose-based
automated GMA. UDF-GMA effectively disentangles uncertainties by directly
modelling aleatoric uncertainty and estimating epistemic uncertainty through
Bayesian approximation. We further propose fusing these uncertainties with the
embedded motion representation to enhance class separation. Extensive
experiments on the Pmi-GMA benchmark dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalisability of the proposed approach in predicting poor repertoire.

Conclusion: 提出的可解释神经分析方法能有效生成高质量视频描述，并为端到端学习提供自动教学支持。

Abstract: The task of describing video content in natural language is commonly referred
to as video captioning. Unlike conventional video captions, which are typically
brief and widely available, long-form paragraph descriptions in natural
language are scarce. This limitation of current datasets is due to the
expensive human manual annotation required and to the highly challenging task
of explaining the language formation process from the perspective of the
underlying story, as a complex system of interconnected events in space and
time. Through a thorough analysis of recently published methods and available
datasets, we identify a general lack of published resources dedicated to the
problem of describing videos in complex language, beyond the level of
descriptions in the form of enumerations of simple captions. Furthermore, while
state-of-the-art methods produce impressive results on the task of generating
shorter captions from videos by direct end-to-end learning between the videos
and text, the problem of explaining the relationship between vision and
language is still beyond our reach. In this work, we propose a shared
representation between vision and language, based on graphs of events in space
and time, which can be obtained in an explainable and analytical way, to
integrate and connect multiple vision tasks to produce the final natural
language description. Moreover, we also demonstrate how our automated and
explainable video description generation process can function as a fully
automatic teacher to effectively train direct, end-to-end neural student
pathways, within a self-supervised neuro-analytical system. We validate that
our explainable neuro-analytical approach generates coherent, rich and relevant
textual descriptions on videos collected from multiple varied datasets, using
both standard evaluation metrics, human annotations and consensus from
ensembles of state-of-the-art VLMs.

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse 2数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SeqGrowGraph通过模拟人类绘图过程，有效解决了复杂车道拓扑建模问题，为自动驾驶提供了更准确的车道结构表示。

Abstract: Accurate lane topology is essential for autonomous driving, yet traditional
methods struggle to model the complex, non-linear structures-such as loops and
bidirectional lanes-prevalent in real-world road structure. We present
SeqGrowGraph, a novel framework that learns lane topology as a chain of graph
expansions, inspired by human map-drawing processes. Representing the lane
graph as a directed graph $G=(V,E)$, with intersections ($V$) and centerlines
($E$), SeqGrowGraph incrementally constructs this graph by introducing one
vertex at a time. At each step, an adjacency matrix ($A$) expands from $n
\times n$ to $(n+1) \times (n+1)$ to encode connectivity, while a geometric
matrix ($M$) captures centerline shapes as quadratic B\'ezier curves. The graph
is serialized into sequences, enabling a transformer model to autoregressively
predict the chain of expansions, guided by a depth-first search ordering.
Evaluated on nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets, SeqGrowGraph achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

Result: 在标准基准测试中表现优异，简化数据准备的同时保持竞争力。

Conclusion: RIPE在关键点提取与描述领域取得显著进展，代码已开源。

Abstract: We introduce RIPE, an innovative reinforcement learning-based framework for
weakly-supervised training of a keypoint extractor that excels in both
detection and description tasks. In contrast to conventional training regimes
that depend heavily on artificial transformations, pre-generated models, or 3D
data, RIPE requires only a binary label indicating whether paired images
represent the same scene. This minimal supervision significantly expands the
pool of training data, enabling the creation of a highly generalized and robust
keypoint extractor.
  RIPE utilizes the encoder's intermediate layers for the description of the
keypoints with a hyper-column approach to integrate information from different
scales. Additionally, we propose an auxiliary loss to enhance the
discriminative capability of the learned descriptors.
  Comprehensive evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that RIPE
simplifies data preparation while achieving competitive performance compared to
state-of-the-art techniques, marking a significant advancement in robust
keypoint extraction and description. To support further research, we have made
our code publicly available at https://github.com/fraunhoferhhi/RIPE.

Method: 设计了CMET指标，包含CMET_L和CMET_G两个分数，分别衡量局部和全局结构保留能力。

Result: 在多种数据集上验证了CMET的优越性，表现优于现有方法，且适用于不同规模和类型的数据。

Conclusion: CMET是一种高效、可靠的指标，适用于量化嵌入质量，具有低复杂度和广泛适用性。

Abstract: Due to rapid advancements in technology, datasets are available from various
domains. In order to carry out more relevant and appropriate analysis, it is
often necessary to project the dataset into a higher or lower dimensional space
based on requirement. Projecting the data in a higher-dimensional space helps
in unfolding intricate patterns, enhancing the performance of the underlying
models. On the other hand, dimensionality reduction is helpful in denoising
data while capturing maximal information, as well as reducing execution time
and memory.In this context, it is not always statistically evident whether the
transformed embedding retains the local and global structure of the original
data. Most of the existing metrics that are used for comparing the local and
global shape of the embedding against the original one are highly expensive in
terms of time and space complexity. In order to address this issue, the
objective of this study is to formulate a novel metric, called Clustering
guided METric (CMET), for quantifying embedding quality. It is effective to
serve the purpose of quantitative comparison between an embedding and the
original data. CMET consists of two scores, viz., CMET_L and CMET_G, that
measure the degree of local and global shape preservation capability,
respectively. The efficacy of CMET has been demonstrated on a wide variety of
datasets, including four synthetic, two biological, and two image datasets.
Results reflect the favorable performance of CMET against the state-of-the-art
methods. Capability to handle both small and large data, low algorithmic
complexity, better and stable performance across all kinds of data, and
different choices of hyper-parameters feature CMET as a reliable metric.

*Colin Laganier,Liam Fletcher,Elim Kwan,Richard Walters,Victoria Nockles*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一种高效且高性能的SAR船只检测模型，基于定制化的YOLOv8架构，适用于卫星部署的低功耗FPGA硬件，性能接近GPU模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代卫星生成的数据量巨大，传统的地面处理方式延迟高，而现有的ML模型又因体积或功耗问题难以部署在卫星上，尤其是在SAR船只检测这一时间敏感任务中。

Method: 采用定制化的YOLOv8架构，针对FPGA处理优化，并在xView3-SAR数据集上训练和评估，最终部署在Kria KV260 MPSoC上。

Result: FPGA模型的检测和分类性能仅比GPU模型低约2%和3%，但体积小2-3个数量级，功耗低于10W。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了小型高性能ML模型在时间关键SAR分析中的应用潜力，为更自主、响应更快的地球观测系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Rapid analysis of satellite data is vital for many remote sensing
applications, from disaster response to environmental monitoring, but is
becoming harder to achieve with the increasing volumes of data generated by
modern satellites. On-satellite machine learning (ML) offers a potential
solution, by reducing latency associated with transmission of these large data
volumes to ground stations, but state-of-the-art models are often too large or
power-hungry for satellite deployment. Vessel detection using Synthetic
Aperture Radar (SAR) is a critical time-sensitive task for maritime security
that exemplifies this challenge. SAR vessel detection has previously been
demonstrated only by ML models that either are too large for satellite
deployment, have not been developed for sufficiently low-power hardware, or
have only been developed and tested on small SAR datasets that do not
sufficiently represent the real-world task. Here we address this issue by
developing and deploying a new efficient and highly performant SAR vessel
detection model, using a customised YOLOv8 architecture specifically optimized
for FPGA-based processing within common satellite power constraints (<10W). We
train and evaluate our model on the largest and most diverse open SAR vessel
dataset, xView3-SAR, and deploy it on a Kria KV260 MPSoC. We show that our
FPGA-based model has detection and classification performance only ~2% and 3%
lower than values from state-of-the-art GPU-based models, despite being two to
three orders of magnitude smaller in size. This work demonstrates small yet
highly performant ML models for time-critical SAR analysis, paving the way for
more autonomous, responsive, and scalable Earth observation systems.

Abstract: 3D spatial graphs play a crucial role in biological and clinical research by
modeling anatomical networks such as blood vessels,neurons, and airways.
However, generating 3D biological graphs while maintaining anatomical validity
remains challenging, a key limitation of existing diffusion-based methods. In
this work, we propose a novel 3D biological graph generation method that
adheres to structural and semantic plausibility conditions. We achieve this by
using a novel projection operator during sampling that stochastically fixes
inconsistencies. Further, we adopt a superior edge-deletion-based noising
procedure suitable for sparse biological graphs. Our method demonstrates
superior performance on two real-world datasets, human circle of Willis and
lung airways, compared to previous approaches. Importantly, we demonstrate that
the generated samples significantly enhance downstream graph labeling
performance. Furthermore, we show that our generative model is a reasonable
out-of-the-box link predictior.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is closely linked to the malignant transformation of
colorectal polyps, making early detection essential. However, current models
struggle with detecting small lesions, accurately localizing boundaries, and
providing interpretable decisions. To address these issues, we propose HGNet,
which integrates High-Order Spatial Awareness Hypergraph and Multi-Scale
Context Attention. Key innovations include: (1) an Efficient Multi-Scale
Context Attention (EMCA) module to enhance lesion feature representation and
boundary modeling; (2) the deployment of a spatial hypergraph convolution
module before the detection head to capture higher-order spatial relationships
between nodes; (3) the application of transfer learning to address the scarcity
of medical image data; and (4) Eigen Class Activation Map (Eigen-CAM) for
decision visualization. Experimental results show that HGNet achieves 94%
accuracy, 90.6% recall, and 90% mAP@0.5, significantly improving small lesion
differentiation and clinical interpretability. The source code will be made

Motivation: 现有的人类中心视频基准过于关注生成质量和动作识别，缺乏对感知和认知能力的全面评估，且评估方式单一。

Method: 设计HV-MMBench，包含15项任务、多种数据形式和评估指标，覆盖50种视觉场景和不同时长视频。

Result: HV-MMBench提供了更全面、多维度、多领域的评估框架，支持对模型能力的系统性分析。

Conclusion: HV-MMBench填补了现有基准的空白，为人类中心视频理解研究提供了更科学的评估工具。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
advances in visual understanding tasks involving both images and videos.
However, their capacity to comprehend human-centric video data remains
underexplored, primarily due to the absence of comprehensive and high-quality
evaluation benchmarks. Existing human-centric benchmarks predominantly
emphasize video generation quality and action recognition, while overlooking
essential perceptual and cognitive abilities required in human-centered
scenarios. Furthermore, they are often limited by single-question paradigms and
overly simplistic evaluation metrics. To address above limitations, we propose
a modern HV-MMBench, a rigorously curated benchmark designed to provide a more
holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric video understanding. Compared to
existing human-centric video benchmarks, our work offers the following key
features: (1) Diverse evaluation dimensions: HV-MMBench encompasses 15 tasks,
ranging from basic attribute perception (e.g., age estimation, emotion
recognition) to advanced cognitive reasoning (e.g., social relationship
prediction, intention prediction), enabling comprehensive assessment of model
capabilities; (2) Varied data types: The benchmark includes multiple-choice,
fill-in-blank, true/false, and open-ended question formats, combined with
diverse evaluation metrics, to more accurately and robustly reflect model
performance; (3) Multi-domain video coverage: The benchmark spans 50 distinct
visual scenarios, enabling comprehensive evaluation across fine-grained scene
variations; (4) Temporal coverage: The benchmark covers videos from short-term
(10 seconds) to long-term (up to 30min) durations, supporting systematic
analysis of models temporal reasoning abilities across diverse contextual
lengths.

Abstract: Identifying regions affected by disasters is a vital step in effectively
managing and planning relief and rescue efforts. Unlike the traditional
approaches of manually assessing post-disaster damage, analyzing images of
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offers an objective and reliable way to assess
the damage. In the past, segmentation techniques have been adopted to identify
post-flood damage in UAV aerial images. However, most of these supervised
learning approaches rely on manually annotated datasets. Indeed, annotating
images is a time-consuming and error-prone task that requires domain expertise.
This work focuses on leveraging self-supervised features to accurately identify
flooded regions in UAV aerial images. This work proposes two
encoder-decoder-based segmentation approaches, which integrate the visual
features learned from DINOv2 with the traditional encoder backbone. This study
investigates the generalization of self-supervised features for UAV aerial
images. Specifically, we evaluate the effectiveness of features from the DINOv2
model, trained on non-aerial images, for segmenting aerial images, noting the
distinct perspectives between the two image types. Our results demonstrate that
DINOv2's self-supervised pretraining on natural images generates transferable,
general-purpose visual features that streamline the development of aerial
segmentation workflows. By leveraging these features as a foundation, we
significantly reduce reliance on labor-intensive manual annotation processes,
enabling high-accuracy segmentation with limited labeled aerial data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于地球系统模型（ESM）在局部风险评估中计算成本高，深度学习降尺度模型成为解决方案。然而，这些模型需要针对不同地理区域重新训练，且高分辨率数据分布不均，因此需要评估其跨区域泛化能力。

Method: 引入RainShift数据集和基准，评估生成对抗网络（GANs）和扩散模型等先进降尺度方法在南北半球数据差距下的泛化表现。

Result: 研究发现模型在分布外区域性能显著下降，扩展训练域虽能改善泛化，但不足以应对地理差异。数据对齐等方法可提升空间泛化能力。

Conclusion: 研究推动了降尺度方法的全球适用性，减少了高分辨率气候信息获取的不平等。

Abstract: Earth System Models (ESM) are our main tool for projecting the impacts of
climate change. However, running these models at sufficient resolution for
local-scale risk-assessments is not computationally feasible. Deep
learning-based super-resolution models offer a promising solution to downscale
ESM outputs to higher resolutions by learning from data. Yet, due to regional
variations in climatic processes, these models typically require retraining for
each geographical area-demanding high-resolution observational data, which is
unevenly available across the globe. This highlights the need to assess how
well these models generalize across geographic regions. To address this, we
introduce RainShift, a dataset and benchmark for evaluating downscaling under
geographic distribution shifts. We evaluate state-of-the-art downscaling
approaches including GANs and diffusion models in generalizing across data gaps
between the Global North and Global South. Our findings reveal substantial
performance drops in out-of-distribution regions, depending on model and
geographic area. While expanding the training domain generally improves
generalization, it is insufficient to overcome shifts between geographically
distinct regions. We show that addressing these shifts through, for example,
data alignment can improve spatial generalization. Our work advances the global
applicability of downscaling methods and represents a step toward reducing
inequities in access to high-resolution climate information.

TL;DR: ReLoop是一个闭环训练框架，通过多模态一致性反馈机制减少MLLMs中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs在视觉问答中表现优异，但存在幻觉问题，缺乏内部验证机制。

Method: 提出ReLoop框架，结合语义重建、视觉描述和注意力监督模块，实现多模态一致性。

Result: 实验证明ReLoop有效降低多个基准测试中的幻觉率。

Conclusion: ReLoop为MLLMs中的幻觉问题提供了稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in open-ended visual question answering, they remain vulnerable to
hallucinations. These are outputs that contradict or misrepresent input
semantics, posing a critical challenge to the reliability and factual
consistency. Existing methods often rely on external verification or post-hoc
correction, lacking an internal mechanism to validate outputs directly during
training. To bridge this gap, we propose ReLoop, a unified closed-loop training
framework that encourages multimodal consistency for cross-modal understanding
in MLLMs. ReLoop adopts a ring-shaped structure that integrates three
complementary consistency feedback mechanisms, obliging MLLMs to "seeing twice
and thinking backwards". Specifically, ReLoop employs the frozen Consistency
Feedback Plugin (CFP), comprising semantic reconstruction, visual description,
and an attention supervision module for attention alignment. These components
collectively enforce semantic reversibility, visual consistency, and
interpretable attention, enabling the model to correct its outputs during
training. Extensive evaluations and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of
ReLoop in reducing hallucination rates across multiple benchmarks, establishing
a robust method for hallucination mitigation in MLLMs. We will release our
source code and data in the camera-ready version.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种认知启发的方法，将文本到图像（T2I）扩散模型中的“幻觉”重新解释为潜在对齐空间中的轨迹漂移，并引入了Hallucination Tri-Space和Alignment Risk Code（ARC）来量化对齐张力，最终开发了TensionModulator（TM-ARC）以减少幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管T2I扩散模型在图像质量和提示保真度方面取得了显著进展，但仍存在“幻觉”问题，即生成内容与提示语义的偏离。本文旨在从认知角度重新理解这些幻觉，并提出一种统一且可解释的方法来缓解这一问题。

Method: 提出了Hallucination Tri-Space（语义连贯性、结构对齐和知识基础的三轴空间）和ARC（动态向量表示），并开发了TM-ARC（一种轻量级控制器），通过实时监控ARC信号并在采样过程中进行针对性干预来减少幻觉。

Result: 实验表明，TM-ARC在不影响图像质量或多样性的情况下显著减少了幻觉。

Conclusion: 本文为理解和缓解T2I扩散模型中的生成失败提供了一种统一且可解释的框架。

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in image quality and prompt fidelity,
text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models continue to exhibit persistent
"hallucinations", where generated content subtly or significantly diverges from
the intended prompt semantics. While often regarded as unpredictable artifacts,
we argue that these failures reflect deeper, structured misalignments within
the generative process. In this work, we propose a cognitively inspired
perspective that reinterprets hallucinations as trajectory drift within a
latent alignment space. Empirical observations reveal that generation unfolds
within a multiaxial cognitive tension field, where the model must continuously
negotiate competing demands across three key critical axes: semantic coherence,
structural alignment, and knowledge grounding. We then formalize this
three-axis space as the \textbf{Hallucination Tri-Space} and introduce the
Alignment Risk Code (ARC): a dynamic vector representation that quantifies
real-time alignment tension during generation. The magnitude of ARC captures
overall misalignment, its direction identifies the dominant failure axis, and
its imbalance reflects tension asymmetry. Based on this formulation, we develop
the TensionModulator (TM-ARC): a lightweight controller that operates entirely
in latent space. TM-ARC monitors ARC signals and applies targeted,
axis-specific interventions during the sampling process. Extensive experiments
on standard T2I benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces
hallucination without compromising image quality or diversity. This framework
offers a unified and interpretable approach for understanding and mitigating
generative failures in diffusion-based T2I systems.

Conclusion: DC-AR在图像生成质量和计算效率上均优于现有模型，具有显著优势。

Abstract: We introduce DC-AR, a novel masked autoregressive (AR) text-to-image
generation framework that delivers superior image generation quality with
exceptional computational efficiency. Due to the tokenizers' limitations, prior
masked AR models have lagged behind diffusion models in terms of quality or
efficiency. We overcome this limitation by introducing DC-HT - a deep
compression hybrid tokenizer for AR models that achieves a 32x spatial
compression ratio while maintaining high reconstruction fidelity and
cross-resolution generalization ability. Building upon DC-HT, we extend MaskGIT
and create a new hybrid masked autoregressive image generation framework that
first produces the structural elements through discrete tokens and then applies
refinements via residual tokens. DC-AR achieves state-of-the-art results with a
gFID of 5.49 on MJHQ-30K and an overall score of 0.69 on GenEval, while
offering 1.5-7.9x higher throughput and 2.0-3.5x lower latency compared to
prior leading diffusion and autoregressive models.

Result: 在公开数据集上验证了方法的优越性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了TSG中的虚假相关问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG) aims to identify relevant moments in an
untrimmed video that semantically correspond to a given textual query. Despite
existing studies having made substantial progress, they often overlook the
issue of spurious correlations between video and textual queries. These
spurious correlations arise from two primary factors: (1) inherent biases in
the textual data, such as frequent co-occurrences of specific verbs or phrases,
and (2) the model's tendency to overfit to salient or repetitive patterns in
video content. Such biases mislead the model into associating textual cues with
incorrect visual moments, resulting in unreliable predictions and poor
generalization to out-of-distribution examples. To overcome these limitations,
we propose a novel TSG framework, causal intervention and counterfactual
reasoning that utilizes causal inference to eliminate spurious correlations and
enhance the model's robustness. Specifically, we first formulate the TSG task
from a causal perspective with a structural causal model. Then, to address
unobserved confounders reflecting textual biases toward specific verbs or
phrases, a textual causal intervention is proposed, utilizing do-calculus to
estimate the causal effects. Furthermore, visual counterfactual reasoning is
performed by constructing a counterfactual scenario that focuses solely on
video features, excluding the query and fused multi-modal features. This allows
us to debias the model by isolating and removing the influence of the video
from the overall effect. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method. The code is available at
https://github.com/Tangkfan/CICR.

Motivation: 现有3D编辑方法在多视图编辑中存在局部不一致问题，且依赖文本提示的编辑过程缺乏灵活性。

Method: 提出CSCS策略筛选语义一致的参考视图，构建3D几何一致性注意力先验（GAP3D），并通过AFN融合3D约束注意力和2D交叉注意力。

Result: 实验表明，InterGSEdit在一致性和高保真度方面表现优异，提升了用户体验。

Conclusion: InterGSEdit通过交互式设计和几何一致性优化，显著提升了3D高斯泼溅编辑的质量和可控性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting based 3D editing has demonstrated impressive
performance in recent years. However, the multi-view editing often exhibits
significant local inconsistency, especially in areas of non-rigid deformation,
which lead to local artifacts, texture blurring, or semantic variations in
edited 3D scenes. We also found that the existing editing methods, which rely
entirely on text prompts make the editing process a "one-shot deal", making it
difficult for users to control the editing degree flexibly. In response to
these challenges, we present InterGSEdit, a novel framework for high-quality
3DGS editing via interactively selecting key views with users' preferences. We
propose a CLIP-based Semantic Consistency Selection (CSCS) strategy to
adaptively screen a group of semantically consistent reference views for each
user-selected key view. Then, the cross-attention maps derived from the
reference views are used in a weighted Gaussian Splatting unprojection to
construct the 3D Geometry-Consistent Attention Prior ($GAP^{3D}$). We project
$GAP^{3D}$ to obtain 3D-constrained attention, which are fused with 2D
cross-attention via Attention Fusion Network (AFN). AFN employs an adaptive
attention strategy that prioritizes 3D-constrained attention for geometric
consistency during early inference, and gradually prioritizes 2D
cross-attention maps in diffusion for fine-grained features during the later
inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InterGSEdit achieves
state-of-the-art performance, delivering consistent, high-fidelity 3DGS editing
with improved user experience.

Result: 实验表明，现有最佳Video-LLMs无法有效拒绝无关问题，而新框架显著提升了这一能力。

Conclusion: 通过alignment for answerability框架，Video-LLMs能更准确地评估问题相关性并拒绝无关问题，提升了实际应用中的实用性。

Abstract: In the broader context of deep learning, Multimodal Large Language Models
have achieved significant breakthroughs by leveraging powerful Large Language
Models as a backbone to align different modalities into the language space. A
prime exemplification is the development of Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs). While numerous advancements have been proposed to enhance the
video understanding capabilities of these models, they are predominantly
trained on questions generated directly from video content. However, in
real-world scenarios, users often pose questions that extend beyond the
informational scope of the video, highlighting the need for Video-LLMs to
assess the relevance of the question. We demonstrate that even the
best-performing Video-LLMs fail to reject unfit questions-not necessarily due
to a lack of video understanding, but because they have not been trained to
identify and refuse such questions. To address this limitation, we propose
alignment for answerability, a framework that equips Video-LLMs with the
ability to evaluate the relevance of a question based on the input video and
appropriately decline to answer when the question exceeds the scope of the
video, as well as an evaluation framework with a comprehensive set of metrics
designed to measure model behavior before and after alignment. Furthermore, we
present a pipeline for creating a dataset specifically tailored for alignment
for answerability, leveraging existing video-description paired datasets.

Motivation: 糖尿病视网膜病变（DR）的严重程度评估对及时治疗至关重要，但现有方法因数据分布不均和类别边界模糊而性能受限。

Method: AOR-DR将DR分级任务分解为一系列有序步骤，结合前序预测和图像特征，并利用扩散过程建模条件概率，直接使用全局图像特征。

Result: 在四个公开的大规模眼底数据集上实验表明，AOR-DR优于六种最新的序数回归方法。

Conclusion: AOR-DR通过自回归和扩散过程有效解决了DR分级中的挑战，为临床提供了更准确的评估工具。

Abstract: As a long-term complication of diabetes, diabetic retinopathy (DR) progresses
slowly, potentially taking years to threaten vision. An accurate and robust
evaluation of its severity is vital to ensure prompt management and care.
Ordinal regression leverages the underlying inherent order between categories
to achieve superior performance beyond traditional classification. However,
there exist challenges leading to lower DR classification performance: 1) The
uneven distribution of DR severity levels, characterized by a long-tailed
pattern, adds complexity to the grading process. 2)The ambiguity in defining
category boundaries introduces additional challenges, making the classification
process more complex and prone to inconsistencies. This work proposes a novel
autoregressive ordinal regression method called AOR-DR to address the above
challenges by leveraging the clinical knowledge of inherent ordinal information
in DR grading dataset settings. Specifically, we decompose the DR grading task
into a series of ordered steps by fusing the prediction of the previous steps
with extracted image features as conditions for the current prediction step.
Additionally, we exploit the diffusion process to facilitate conditional
probability modeling, enabling the direct use of continuous global image
features for autoregression without relearning contextual information from
patch-level features. This ensures the effectiveness of the autoregressive
process and leverages the capabilities of pre-trained large-scale foundation
models. Extensive experiments were conducted on four large-scale publicly
available color fundus datasets, demonstrating our model's effectiveness and
superior performance over six recent state-of-the-art ordinal regression
methods. The implementation code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TLB-VFI是一种高效的基于视频的扩散模型，通过提取时间信息和减少参数，显著提升了视频帧插值的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于图像的扩散模型无法提取时间信息且效率低，以及基于视频的扩散模型规模过大、训练和推理时间过长的问题。

Method: 提出TLB-VFI，结合3D小波门控和时间感知自编码器提取时间信息，并通过光流引导减少训练数据和参数。

Result: 在最具挑战性的数据集上FID提升20%，参数减少3倍，速度提升2.3倍，训练数据需求减少9000倍，参数比视频扩散模型少20倍。

Conclusion: TLB-VFI在性能和效率上均优于现有方法，为视频帧插值提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) aims to predict the intermediate frame $I_n$
(we use n to denote time in videos to avoid notation overload with the timestep
$t$ in diffusion models) based on two consecutive neighboring frames $I_0$ and
$I_1$. Recent approaches apply diffusion models (both image-based and
video-based) in this task and achieve strong performance. However, image-based
diffusion models are unable to extract temporal information and are relatively
inefficient compared to non-diffusion methods. Video-based diffusion models can
extract temporal information, but they are too large in terms of training
scale, model size, and inference time. To mitigate the above issues, we propose
Temporal-Aware Latent Brownian Bridge Diffusion for Video Frame Interpolation
(TLB-VFI), an efficient video-based diffusion model. By extracting rich
temporal information from video inputs through our proposed 3D-wavelet gating
and temporal-aware autoencoder, our method achieves 20% improvement in FID on
the most challenging datasets over recent SOTA of image-based diffusion models.
Meanwhile, due to the existence of rich temporal information, our method
achieves strong performance while having 3times fewer parameters. Such a
parameter reduction results in 2.3x speed up. By incorporating optical flow
guidance, our method requires 9000x less training data and achieves over 20x
fewer parameters than video-based diffusion models. Codes and results are
available at our project page: https://zonglinl.github.io/tlbvfi_page.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OPAL是一种基于混合整数线性规划（MILP）的人工辅助标注方法，旨在以最小化人工标注努力为目标，达到指定的标注准确率。在测试视觉系统的任务中，OPAL表现优异，平均准确率达98.8%，同时减少一半以上的人工标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习（DL）中高质量标注数据的稀缺性是一个主要挑战。尽管训练时可以容忍一定程度的标注噪声，但测试时需要接近100%的准确率以确保可靠性。

Method: OPAL通过MILP优化标注努力，同时满足指定的准确率目标。方法还包括自动标注测试数据和验证测试数据的功能。

Result: 在七个数据集上的2500多次实验中，OPAL平均准确率为98.8%，比基线方法表现更好，且减少人工标注50%以上。在自动测试验证任务中，OPAL减少28.8%的人工努力，准确率提高4.5%。

Conclusion: OPAL是一种高效的人工辅助标注方法，显著减少人工标注努力，同时保持高准确率。结合主动学习可进一步减少标注需求。

Abstract: The scarcity of accurately labelled data remains a major challenge in deep
learning (DL). Many DL approaches rely on semi-supervised methods, which focus
on constructing large datasets that require only a minimal amount of
human-labelled data. Since DL training algorithms can tolerate moderate label
noise, it has generally been acceptable for the accuracy of labels in large
training datasets to fall well short of a perfect 100%. However, when it comes
to testing DL models, achieving high label accuracy-as close to 100% as
possible-is paramount for reliable verification. In this article, we introduce
OPAL, a human-assisted labelling method that can be configured to target a
desired accuracy level while minimizing the manual effort required for
labelling. The main contribution of OPAL is a mixed-integer linear programming
(MILP) formulation that minimizes labelling effort subject to a specified
accuracy target. We evaluate OPAL for two tasks in the context of testing
vision systems: automatic labelling of test data and automated validation of
test data. Our evaluation, based on more than 2500 experiments performed on
seven datasets, comparing OPAL with eight baseline methods, shows that OPAL,
relying on its MILP formulation, achieves an average accuracy of 98.8%, just
1.2% below perfect accuracy, while cutting manual labelling by more than half.
Further, OPAL significantly outperforms automated labelling baselines in
labelling accuracy across all seven datasets, with large effect sizes, when all
methods are provided with the same manual-labelling budget. For automated
test-input validation, on average, OPAL reduces manual effort by 28.8% while
achieving 4.5% higher accuracy than the SOTA validation baselines. Finally, we
show that augmenting OPAL with an active learning loop leads to an additional
4.5% reduction in required manual labelling, without compromising accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出一种多模态眼科图像诊断框架，解决模态缺失问题，通过特征对齐和融合实现鲁棒诊断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球医疗资源分布不均导致多模态数据不完整，影响诊断准确性，现有方法在特征重建和依赖完全配对数据上存在局限。

Conclusion: 所提框架能有效处理模态缺失问题，提升眼科诊断的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Multimodal ophthalmic imaging-based diagnosis integrates color fundus image
with optical coherence tomography (OCT) to provide a comprehensive view of
ocular pathologies. However, the uneven global distribution of healthcare
resources often results in real-world clinical scenarios encountering
incomplete multimodal data, which significantly compromises diagnostic
accuracy. Existing commonly used pipelines, such as modality imputation and
distillation methods, face notable limitations: 1)Imputation methods struggle
with accurately reconstructing key lesion features, since OCT lesions are
localized, while fundus images vary in style. 2)distillation methods rely
heavily on fully paired multimodal training data. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel multimodal alignment and fusion framework capable of
robustly handling missing modalities in the task of ophthalmic diagnostics. By
considering the distinctive feature characteristics of OCT and fundus images,
we emphasize the alignment of semantic features within the same category and
explicitly learn soft matching between modalities, allowing the missing
modality to utilize existing modality information, achieving robust cross-modal
feature alignment under the missing modality. Specifically, we leverage the
Optimal Transport for multi-scale modality feature alignment: class-wise
alignment through predicted class prototypes and feature-wise alignment via
cross-modal shared feature transport. Furthermore, we propose an asymmetric
fusion strategy that effectively exploits the distinct characteristics of OCT
and fundus modalities. Extensive evaluations on three large ophthalmic
multimodal datasets demonstrate our model's superior performance under various
modality-incomplete scenarios, achieving Sota performance in both complete
modality and inter-modality incompleteness conditions. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出CVS-AdaptNet，一种多标签适应策略，利用文本提示增强多模态手术基础模型，以自动化CVS识别，性能优于仅图像方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CVS识别在腹腔镜胆囊切除术中至关重要，但传统方法依赖高成本的空间标注，且现有多模态模型在多标签任务上表现不佳。

Method: 提出CVS-AdaptNet，通过图像嵌入与文本描述对齐，增强多标签分类，并采用正负提示优化性能。

Result: CVS-AdaptNet在Endoscapes-CVS201数据集上达到57.6 mAP，优于仅图像基线（51.5 mAP）。

Conclusion: 文本提示增强的多模态框架在CVS识别中表现优异，展示了通用模型适应专业手术任务的潜力。

Abstract: The Critical View of Safety (CVS) is crucial for safe laparoscopic
cholecystectomy, yet assessing CVS criteria remains a complex and challenging
task, even for experts. Traditional models for CVS recognition depend on
vision-only models learning with costly, labor-intensive spatial annotations.
This study investigates how text can be harnessed as a powerful tool for both
training and inference in multi-modal surgical foundation models to automate
CVS recognition. Unlike many existing multi-modal models, which are primarily
adapted for multi-class classification, CVS recognition requires a multi-label
framework. Zero-shot evaluation of existing multi-modal surgical models shows a
significant performance gap for this task. To address this, we propose
CVS-AdaptNet, a multi-label adaptation strategy that enhances fine-grained,
binary classification across multiple labels by aligning image embeddings with
textual descriptions of each CVS criterion using positive and negative prompts.
By adapting PeskaVLP, a state-of-the-art surgical foundation model, on the
Endoscapes-CVS201 dataset, CVS-AdaptNet achieves 57.6 mAP, improving over the
ResNet50 image-only baseline (51.5 mAP) by 6 points. Our results show that
CVS-AdaptNet's multi-label, multi-modal framework, enhanced by textual prompts,
boosts CVS recognition over image-only methods. We also propose text-specific
inference methods, that helps in analysing the image-text alignment. While
further work is needed to match state-of-the-art spatial annotation-based
methods, this approach highlights the potential of adapting generalist models
to specialized surgical tasks. Code:

TL;DR: MML-SurgAdapt是一个统一的多任务框架，利用视觉语言模型（VLMs）处理多样化的手术任务，通过自然语言监督和单正多标签学习（SPML）解决部分标注问题，减少标注负担。

Motivation: 传统模型缺乏灵活性，需要为每个任务单独构建模型，而手术AI通常涉及多个任务。MML-SurgAdapt旨在通过统一框架解决这一问题。

Method: 采用视觉语言模型（如CLIP）和单正多标签学习（SPML），整合多个手术任务的数据，即使标注不完整或嘈杂。

Conclusion: MML-SurgAdapt是首个将SPML应用于多手术任务数据整合的解决方案，为手术计算机视觉中的多任务学习提供了可扩展且高效的标注方法。

Abstract: Surgical AI often involves multiple tasks within a single procedure, like
phase recognition or assessing the Critical View of Safety in laparoscopic
cholecystectomy. Traditional models, built for one task at a time, lack
flexibility, requiring a separate model for each. To address this, we introduce
MML-SurgAdapt, a unified multi-task framework with Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), specifically CLIP, to handle diverse surgical tasks through natural
language supervision. A key challenge in multi-task learning is the presence of
partial annotations when integrating different tasks. To overcome this, we
employ Single Positive Multi-Label (SPML) learning, which traditionally reduces
annotation burden by training models with only one positive label per instance.
Our framework extends this approach to integrate data from multiple surgical
tasks within a single procedure, enabling effective learning despite incomplete
or noisy annotations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a
combined dataset consisting of Cholec80, Endoscapes2023, and CholecT50,
utilizing custom prompts. Extensive evaluation shows that MML-SurgAdapt
performs comparably to task-specific benchmarks, with the added advantage of
handling noisy annotations. It also outperforms the existing SPML frameworks
for the task. By reducing the required labels by 23%, our approach proposes a
more scalable and efficient labeling process, significantly easing the
annotation burden on clinicians. To our knowledge, this is the first
application of SPML to integrate data from multiple surgical tasks, presenting
a novel and generalizable solution for multi-task learning in surgical computer
vision. Implementation is available at:

Abstract: Inertial mass plays a crucial role in robotic applications such as object
grasping, manipulation, and simulation, providing a strong prior for planning
and control. Accurately estimating an object's mass before interaction can
significantly enhance the performance of various robotic tasks. However, mass
estimation using only vision sensors is a relatively underexplored area. This
paper proposes a novel approach combining sparse point-cloud data from depth
images with RGB images to estimate the mass of objects. We evaluate a range of
point-cloud processing architectures, alongside RGB-only methods. To overcome
the limited availability of training data, we create a synthetic dataset using
ShapeNetSem 3D models, simulating RGBD images via a Kinect camera. This
synthetic data is used to train an image generation model for estimating dense
depth maps, which we then use to augment an existing dataset of images paired
with mass values. Our approach significantly outperforms existing benchmarks
across all evaluated metrics. The data generation
(https://github.com/RavineWindteer/ShapenetSem-to-RGBD) as well as the training
of the depth estimator (https://github.com/RavineWindteer/GLPDepth-Edited) and
the mass estimator (https://github.com/RavineWindteer/Depth-mass-estimator) are

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）在生成响应时可能出现与视觉内容不一致的幻觉现象，而人类则能有效利用多模态交互信息避免这一问题。论文旨在通过模仿人类认知行为减少LVLM的幻觉。

Conclusion: INTER通过模仿人类的多模态信息处理方式，有效减少了LVLM的幻觉现象，为实际应用提供了改进方案。

Abstract: Hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) pose significant
challenges for real-world applications, as LVLMs may generate responses that
appear plausible yet remain inconsistent with the associated visual content.
This issue rarely occurs in human cognition. We argue that this discrepancy
arises from humans' ability to effectively leverage multimodal interaction
information in data samples. Specifically, humans typically first gather
multimodal information, analyze the interactions across modalities for
understanding, and then express their understanding through language. Motivated
by this observation, we conduct extensive experiments on popular LVLMs and
obtained insights that surprisingly reveal human-like, though less pronounced,
cognitive behavior of LVLMs on multimodal samples. Building on these findings,
we further propose \textbf{INTER}: \textbf{Inter}action Guidance Sampling, a
novel training-free algorithm that mitigate hallucinations without requiring
additional data. Specifically, INTER explicitly guides LVLMs to effectively
reapply their understanding of multimodal interaction information when
generating responses, thereby reducing potential hallucinations. On six
benchmarks including VQA and image captioning tasks, INTER achieves an average
improvement of up to 3.4\% on five LVLMs compared to the state-of-the-art
decoding strategy. The code will be released when the paper is accepted.

Abstract: Biomedical datasets often contain a large sample imbalance and are subject to
strict privacy constraints, which together hinder the development of accurate
machine learning models. One potential solution is to generate synthetic
images, as this can improve data availability while preserving patient privacy.
However, it remains difficult to generate synthetic images of sufficient
quality for training robust classifiers. In this work, we focus on the
classification of single white blood cells, a key component in the diagnosis of
hematological diseases such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a severe blood
cancer. We demonstrate how synthetic images generated with a fine-tuned stable
diffusion model using LoRA weights when guided by real few-shot samples of the
target white blood cell classes, can enhance classifier performance for limited
data. When training a ResNet classifier, accuracy increased from 27.3\% to
78.4\% (+51.1\%) by adding 5000 synthetic images per class to a small and
highly imbalanced real dataset. For a CLIP-based classifier, the accuracy
improved from 61.8\% to 76.8\% (+15.0\%). The synthetic images are highly
similar to real images, and they can help overcome dataset limitations,
enhancing model generalization. Our results establish synthetic images as a
tool in biomedical research, improving machine learning models, and
facilitating medical diagnosis and research.

Abstract: Autoregressive image generation has witnessed rapid advancements, with
prominent models such as scale-wise visual auto-regression pushing the
boundaries of visual synthesis. However, these developments also raise
significant concerns regarding data privacy and copyright. In response,
training data detection has emerged as a critical task for identifying
unauthorized data usage in model training. To better understand the
vulnerability of autoregressive image generative models to such detection, we
conduct the first study applying membership inference to this domain. Our
approach comprises two key components: implicit classification and an adaptive
score aggregation strategy. First, we compute the implicit token-wise
classification score within the query image. Then we propose an adaptive score
aggregation strategy to acquire a final score, which places greater emphasis on
the tokens with lower scores. A higher final score indicates that the sample is
more likely to be involved in the training set. To validate the effectiveness
of our method, we adapt existing detection algorithms originally designed for
LLMs to visual autoregressive models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our method in both class-conditional and text-to-image
scenarios. Moreover, our approach exhibits strong robustness and generalization
under various data transformations. Furthermore, sufficient experiments suggest
two novel key findings: (1) A linear scaling law on membership inference,
exposing the vulnerability of large foundation models. (2) Training data from
scale-wise visual autoregressive models is easier to detect than other
autoregressive paradigms.Our code is available at

Conclusion: MoDiT框架显著提升了说话头生成的质量和真实性。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head generation is critical for applications such as
virtual assistants, video games, and films, where natural lip movements are
essential. Despite progress in this field, challenges remain in producing both
consistent and realistic facial animations. Existing methods, often based on
GANs or UNet-based diffusion models, face three major limitations: (i) temporal
jittering caused by weak temporal constraints, resulting in frame
inconsistencies; (ii) identity drift due to insufficient 3D information
extraction, leading to poor preservation of facial identity; and (iii)
unnatural blinking behavior due to inadequate modeling of realistic blink
dynamics. To address these issues, we propose MoDiT, a novel framework that
combines the 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) with a Diffusion-based Transformer. Our
contributions include: (i) A hierarchical denoising strategy with revised
temporal attention and biased self/cross-attention mechanisms, enabling the
model to refine lip synchronization and progressively enhance full-face
coherence, effectively mitigating temporal jittering. (ii) The integration of
3DMM coefficients to provide explicit spatial constraints, ensuring accurate
3D-informed optical flow prediction and improved lip synchronization using
Wav2Lip results, thereby preserving identity consistency. (iii) A refined
blinking strategy to model natural eye movements, with smoother and more
realistic blinking behaviors.

Conclusion: AutoHDR在自动化历史文档修复方面取得显著进展，对文化遗产保护有重要贡献。

Abstract: Historical documents represent an invaluable cultural heritage, yet have
undergone significant degradation over time through tears, water erosion, and
oxidation. Existing Historical Document Restoration (HDR) methods primarily
focus on single modality or limited-size restoration, failing to meet practical
needs. To fill this gap, we present a full-page HDR dataset (FPHDR) and a novel
automated HDR solution (AutoHDR). Specifically, FPHDR comprises 1,633 real and
6,543 synthetic images with character-level and line-level locations, as well
as character annotations in different damage grades. AutoHDR mimics historians'
restoration workflows through a three-stage approach: OCR-assisted damage
localization, vision-language context text prediction, and patch autoregressive
appearance restoration. The modular architecture of AutoHDR enables seamless
human-machine collaboration, allowing for flexible intervention and
optimization at each restoration stage. Experiments demonstrate AutoHDR's
remarkable performance in HDR. When processing severely damaged documents, our
method improves OCR accuracy from 46.83\% to 84.05\%, with further enhancement
to 94.25\% through human-machine collaboration. We believe this work represents
a significant advancement in automated historical document restoration and
contributes substantially to cultural heritage preservation. The model and

Abstract: The widespread and rapid adoption of AI-generated content, created by models
such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models, has
revolutionized the digital media landscape by allowing efficient and creative
content generation. However, these models also blur the difference between real
images and AI-generated synthetic images, raising concerns regarding content
authenticity and integrity. While many existing solutions to detect fake images
focus solely on classification and higher-resolution images, they often lack
transparency in their decision-making, making it difficult for users to
understand why an image is classified as fake. In this paper, we present
VERITAS, a comprehensive framework that not only accurately detects whether a
small (32x32) image is AI-generated but also explains why it was classified
that way through artifact localization and semantic reasoning. VERITAS produces
human-readable explanations that describe key artifacts in synthetic images. We

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前AI生成图像检测方法依赖计算密集型模型的问题，推动实时、大规模部署的可行性。

Method: 通过LAID框架，在GenImage数据集上全面训练和评估轻量级模型的空间、频谱和融合图像域性能。

Result: 轻量级模型在对抗条件下仍能保持高准确率，同时显著降低内存和计算成本。

Conclusion: 研究为高效、可扩展且可信赖的AI生成图像检测系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: The recent proliferation of photorealistic AI-generated images (AIGI) has
raised urgent concerns about their potential misuse, particularly on social
media platforms. Current state-of-the-art AIGI detection methods typically rely
on large, deep neural architectures, creating significant computational
barriers to real-time, large-scale deployment on platforms like social media.
To challenge this reliance on computationally intensive models, we introduce
LAID, the first framework -- to our knowledge -- that benchmarks and evaluates
the detection performance and efficiency of off-the-shelf lightweight neural
networks. In this framework, we comprehensively train and evaluate selected
models on a representative subset of the GenImage dataset across spatial,
spectral, and fusion image domains. Our results demonstrate that lightweight
models can achieve competitive accuracy, even under adversarial conditions,
while incurring substantially lower memory and computation costs compared to
current state-of-the-art methods. This study offers valuable insight into the
trade-off between efficiency and performance in AIGI detection and lays a
foundation for the development of practical, scalable, and trustworthy
detection systems. The source code of LAID can be found at:

*Yutian Chen,Shi Guo,Tianshuo Yang,Lihe Ding,Xiuyuan Yu,Jinwei Gu,Tianfan Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用低帧率相机实现高速4D场景重建的系统，通过异步捕获和生成模型提升有效帧率和重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有4D捕获系统帧率低，直接重建高速运动会导致不良结果，需提升重建效果。

Method: 采用异步捕获方案提高有效帧率，结合生成模型修复稀疏视图重建的伪影。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著优于同步捕获，实现了100-200 FPS的等效帧率。

Conclusion: 该系统为高速4D重建提供了一种低成本高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing fast-dynamic scenes from multi-view videos is crucial for
high-speed motion analysis and realistic 4D reconstruction. However, the
majority of 4D capture systems are limited to frame rates below 30 FPS (frames
per second), and a direct 4D reconstruction of high-speed motion from low FPS
input may lead to undesirable results. In this work, we propose a high-speed 4D
capturing system only using low FPS cameras, through novel capturing and
processing modules. On the capturing side, we propose an asynchronous capture
scheme that increases the effective frame rate by staggering the start times of
cameras. By grouping cameras and leveraging a base frame rate of 25 FPS, our
method achieves an equivalent frame rate of 100-200 FPS without requiring
specialized high-speed cameras. On processing side, we also propose a novel
generative model to fix artifacts caused by 4D sparse-view reconstruction, as
asynchrony reduces the number of viewpoints at each timestamp. Specifically, we
propose to train a video-diffusion-based artifact-fix model for sparse 4D
reconstruction, which refines missing details, maintains temporal consistency,
and improves overall reconstruction quality. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method significantly enhances high-speed 4D reconstruction compared to
synchronous capture.

Motivation: 社交媒体在危机事件中提供多模态数据流，但从中提取有效信息并整合异构数据仍具挑战性。

Method: 采用VLMs（如LLaVA和CLIP）、Guided Cross Attention和Differential Attention机制，优化多模态特征对齐和分类。

Result: 在CrisisMMD数据集上，结合预训练VLMs和自适应融合策略的分类模型表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了危机事件多模态数据的分类准确性和可解释性，为灾害响应提供了更可靠的模型。

Abstract: Social networks can be a valuable source of information during crisis events.
In particular, users can post a stream of multimodal data that can be critical
for real-time humanitarian response. However, effectively extracting meaningful
information from this large and noisy data stream and effectively integrating
heterogeneous data remains a formidable challenge. In this work, we explore
vision language models (VLMs) and advanced fusion strategies to enhance the
classification of crisis data in three different tasks. We incorporate
LLaVA-generated text to improve text-image alignment. Additionally, we leverage
Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)-based vision and text embeddings,
which, without task-specific fine-tuning, outperform traditional models. To
further refine multimodal fusion, we employ Guided Cross Attention (Guided CA)
and combine it with the Differential Attention mechanism to enhance feature
alignment by emphasizing critical information while filtering out irrelevant
content. Our results show that while Differential Attention improves
classification performance, Guided CA remains highly effective in aligning
multimodal features. Extensive experiments on the CrisisMMD benchmark data set
demonstrate that the combination of pretrained VLMs, enriched textual
descriptions, and adaptive fusion strategies consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art models in classification accuracy, contributing to more
reliable and interpretable models for three different tasks that are crucial
for disaster response. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统帧插值任务局限于少量帧、无文本控制且帧间差异小，而现有大视频模型无法灵活生成不同帧数的内容。

Method: 基于Wan2.1提出SemFi模型，引入Mixture-of-LoRA模块，支持多帧率推理，并构建SFI-300K数据集和评估标准。

Result: 实验表明，SemFi模型在SFI任务中表现优异，尤其在一致性和多样性方面。

Conclusion: SemFi模型和SFI-300K为语义帧插值任务提供了有效解决方案，填补了研究空白。

Abstract: Generating intermediate video content of varying lengths based on given first
and last frames, along with text prompt information, offers significant
research and application potential. However, traditional frame interpolation
tasks primarily focus on scenarios with a small number of frames, no text
control, and minimal differences between the first and last frames. Recent
community developers have utilized large video models represented by Wan to
endow frame-to-frame capabilities. However, these models can only generate a
fixed number of frames and often fail to produce satisfactory results for
certain frame lengths, while this setting lacks a clear official definition and
a well-established benchmark. In this paper, we first propose a new practical
Semantic Frame Interpolation (SFI) task from the perspective of academic
definition, which covers the above two settings and supports inference at
multiple frame rates. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel SemFi model
building upon Wan2.1, which incorporates a Mixture-of-LoRA module to ensure the
generation of high-consistency content that aligns with control conditions
across various frame length limitations. Furthermore, we propose SFI-300K, the
first general-purpose dataset and benchmark specifically designed for SFI. To
support this, we collect and process data from the perspective of SFI,
carefully designing evaluation metrics and methods to assess the model's
performance across multiple dimensions, encompassing image and video, and
various aspects, including consistency and diversity. Through extensive
experiments on SFI-300K, we demonstrate that our method is particularly
well-suited to meet the requirements of the SFI task.

Conclusion: 该方法推动了物理建模与领域适应的结合，为深度学习和材料科学提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Characterizing quantum flakes is a critical step in quantum hardware
engineering because the quality of these flakes directly influences qubit
performance. Although computer vision methods for identifying two-dimensional
quantum flakes have emerged, they still face significant challenges in
estimating flake thickness. These challenges include limited data, poor
generalization, sensitivity to domain shifts, and a lack of physical
interpretability. In this paper, we introduce one of the first Physics-informed
Adaptation Learning approaches to overcome these obstacles. We focus on two
main issues, i.e., data scarcity and generalization. First, we propose a new
synthetic data generation framework that produces diverse quantum flake samples
across various materials and configurations, reducing the need for
time-consuming manual collection. Second, we present $\varphi$-Adapt, a
physics-informed adaptation method that bridges the performance gap between
models trained on synthetic data and those deployed in real-world settings.
Experimental results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on multiple benchmarks, outperforming existing methods. Our
proposed approach advances the integration of physics-based modeling and domain
adaptation. It also addresses a critical gap in leveraging synthesized data for
real-world 2D material analysis, offering impactful tools for deep learning and
materials science communities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统遥感方法难以应对碎片化农业景观的时空异质性，影响粮食安全和农业政策制定。

Method: 采用物候驱动的分类框架，针对32个地区进行本地化校准，适应农业生态变化。

Result: 整体准确率达93.3%，优于传统方法8.0个百分点，成功绘制732,345公顷稻田。

Conclusion: 遥感框架需适应景观复杂性，推动区域特异性农业监测方法，兼顾科学严谨性与实际应用。

Abstract: Accurate rice area monitoring is critical for food security and agricultural
policy in smallholder farming regions, yet conventional remote sensing
approaches struggle with the spatiotemporal heterogeneity characteristic of
fragmented agricultural landscapes. This study developed a phenology-driven
classification framework that systematically adapts to local agro-ecological
variations across 32 districts in Telangana, India during the 2018-19 Rabi rice
season. The research reveals significant spatiotemporal diversity, with
phenological timing varying by up to 50 days between districts and field sizes
ranging from 0.01 to 2.94 hectares. Our district-specific calibration approach
achieved 93.3% overall accuracy, an 8.0 percentage point improvement over
conventional regional clustering methods, with strong validation against
official government statistics (R^2 = 0.981) demonstrating excellent agreement
between remotely sensed and ground truth data. The framework successfully
mapped 732,345 hectares by adapting to agro-climatic variations, with Northern
districts requiring extended land preparation phases (up to 55 days) while
Southern districts showed compressed cultivation cycles. Field size analysis
revealed accuracy declining 6.8 percentage points from medium to tiny fields,
providing insights for operational monitoring in fragmented landscapes. These
findings demonstrate that remote sensing frameworks must embrace rather than
simplify landscape complexity, advancing region-specific agricultural
monitoring approaches that maintain scientific rigor while serving practical
policy and food security applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因监督有限和多模态线索不足，难以区分细粒度对象类别。

Result: 在语义、实例和全景分割任务中达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: VDG-Uni3DSeg为3D场景理解提供了可扩展且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Unified segmentation of 3D point clouds is crucial for scene understanding,
but is hindered by its sparse structure, limited annotations, and the challenge
of distinguishing fine-grained object classes in complex environments. Existing
methods often struggle to capture rich semantic and contextual information due
to limited supervision and a lack of diverse multimodal cues, leading to
suboptimal differentiation of classes and instances. To address these
challenges, we propose VDG-Uni3DSeg, a novel framework that integrates
pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) and large language models
(LLMs) to enhance 3D segmentation. By leveraging LLM-generated textual
descriptions and reference images from the internet, our method incorporates
rich multimodal cues, facilitating fine-grained class and instance separation.
We further design a Semantic-Visual Contrastive Loss to align point features
with multimodal queries and a Spatial Enhanced Module to model scene-wide
relationships efficiently. Operating within a closed-set paradigm that utilizes
multimodal knowledge generated offline, VDG-Uni3DSeg achieves state-of-the-art
results in semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation, offering a scalable
and practical solution for 3D understanding. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度模型在分布变化（如领域或数据集变化）时性能下降，测试时训练（TTT）虽能提升鲁棒性，但现有方法需要专用架构。CTA旨在通过多模态对比学习对齐监督与自监督编码器，解决梯度干扰问题。

Method: CTA利用多模态对比学习，对齐监督编码器与自监督编码器的表示，避免梯度干扰，保留自监督学习的鲁棒性，并在测试时实现更有语义意义的更新。

Result: 实验结果表明，CTA在多个基准数据集上显著提升了鲁棒性和泛化能力，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CTA通过跨任务对齐改进了TTT，无需专用架构，显著提升了模型在分布变化下的性能。

Abstract: Deep learning models have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide
range of computer vision tasks. However, their performance often degrades
significantly when faced with distribution shifts, such as domain or dataset
changes. Test-Time Training (TTT) has emerged as an effective method to enhance
model robustness by incorporating an auxiliary unsupervised task during
training and leveraging it for model updates at test time. In this work, we
introduce CTA (Cross-Task Alignment), a novel approach for improving TTT.
Unlike existing TTT methods, CTA does not require a specialized model
architecture and instead takes inspiration from the success of multi-modal
contrastive learning to align a supervised encoder with a self-supervised one.
This process enforces alignment between the learned representations of both
models, thereby mitigating the risk of gradient interference, preserving the
intrinsic robustness of self-supervised learning and enabling more semantically
meaningful updates at test-time. Experimental results demonstrate substantial
improvements in robustness and generalization over the state-of-the-art on
several benchmark datasets.

Motivation: 在低帧率无人机视频中，由于物体外观和位置的快速变化以及图像质量下降，多目标跟踪变得复杂。

Method: 利用单帧注释学习实例关联，并结合全局场景特征提供上下文，以提高跟踪的鲁棒性。

Result: 该方法在降低输入图像分辨率和潜在表示大小的情况下仍能保持高质量的关联，并提出了一个军事车辆基准数据集。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂场景下表现优异，适用于实际作战中的多目标跟踪任务。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) aims to maintain consistent identities of objects
across video frames. Associating objects in low-frame-rate videos captured by
moving unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in actual combat scenarios is complex
due to rapid changes in object appearance and position within the frame. The
task becomes even more challenging due to image degradation caused by cloud
video streaming and compression algorithms. We present how instance association
learning from single-frame annotations can overcome these challenges. We show
that global features of the scene provide crucial context for low-FPS instance
association, allowing our solution to be robust to distractors and gaps in
detections. We also demonstrate that such a tracking approach maintains high
association quality even when reducing the input image resolution and latent
representation size for faster inference. Finally, we present a benchmark
dataset of annotated military vehicles collected from publicly available data
sources. This paper was initially presented at the NATO Science and Technology
Organization Symposium (ICMCIS) organized by the Information Systems Technology
(IST)Scientific and Technical Committee, IST-209-RSY - the ICMCIS, held in

Conclusion: 该方法为多领域信号分离问题提供了通用框架。

Abstract: Significant challenges exist in efficient data analysis of most advanced
experimental and observational techniques because the collected signals often
include unwanted contributions--such as background and signal distortions--that
can obscure the physically relevant information of interest. To address this,
we have developed a self-supervised machine-learning approach for source
separation using a dual implicit neural representation framework that jointly
trains two neural networks: one for approximating distortions of the physical
signal of interest and the other for learning the effective background
contribution. Our method learns directly from the raw data by minimizing a
reconstruction-based loss function without requiring labeled data or
pre-defined dictionaries. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by
considering a challenging case study involving large-scale simulated as well as
experimental momentum-energy-dependent inelastic neutron scattering data in a
four-dimensional parameter space, characterized by heterogeneous background
contributions and unknown distortions to the target signal. The method is found
to successfully separate physically meaningful signals from a complex or
structured background even when the signal characteristics vary across all four
dimensions of the parameter space. An analytical approach that informs the
choice of the regularization parameter is presented. Our method offers a
versatile framework for addressing source separation problems across diverse
domains, ranging from superimposed signals in astronomical measurements to
structural features in biomedical image reconstructions.

Method: 采用两阶段范式：1）大规模语言冷启动微调；2）多模态强化学习（RL），共近1000步。

Result: 模型Open-Vision-Reasoner（OVR）在多个推理基准测试中表现优异，如MATH500（95.3%）、MathVision（51.8%）和MathVerse（54.6%）。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了行为迁移的早期现象和RL的关键作用，为开发更强大的多模态推理模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: The remarkable reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) stems
from cognitive behaviors that emerge through reinforcement with verifiable
rewards. This work investigates how to transfer this principle to Multimodal
LLMs (MLLMs) to unlock advanced visual reasoning. We introduce a two-stage
paradigm built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B: a massive linguistic cold-start fine-tuning,
followed by multimodal reinforcement learning (RL) spanning nearly 1,000 steps,
surpassing all previous open-source efforts in scale. This pioneering work
reveals three fundamental insights: 1) Behavior transfer emerges surprisingly
early in cold start due to linguistic mental imagery. 2) Cold start broadly
memorizes visual behaviors, while RL critically discerns and scales up
effective patterns. 3) Transfer strategically favors high-utility behaviors
such as visual reflection. Our resulting model, Open-Vision-Reasoner (OVR),
achieves state-of-the-art performance on a suite of reasoning benchmarks,
including 95.3% on MATH500, 51.8% on MathVision and 54.6% on MathVerse. We
release our model, data, and training dynamics to catalyze the development of
more capable, behavior-aligned multimodal reasoners.

Motivation: 现有基于一致性蒸馏（CD）的方法因自一致性和跨一致性的不平衡导致生成结果不理想，需要改进。

Method: 提出SCTD方法，将概率流常微分方程（PF-ODE）轨迹分段，确保每段内的一致性，并优化蒸馏流程。

Result: 实验表明SegmentDreamer在视觉质量上优于现有方法，支持高保真3D资产生成。

Conclusion: SegmentDreamer通过SCTD有效解决了不平衡问题，提升了文本到3D生成的性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-3D generation improve the visual quality of
Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) and its variants by directly connecting
Consistency Distillation (CD) to score distillation. However, due to the
imbalance between self-consistency and cross-consistency, these CD-based
methods inherently suffer from improper conditional guidance, leading to
sub-optimal generation results. To address this issue, we present
SegmentDreamer, a novel framework designed to fully unleash the potential of
consistency models for high-fidelity text-to-3D generation. Specifically, we
reformulate SDS through the proposed Segmented Consistency Trajectory
Distillation (SCTD), effectively mitigating the imbalance issues by explicitly
defining the relationship between self- and cross-consistency. Moreover, SCTD
partitions the Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE)
trajectory into multiple sub-trajectories and ensures consistency within each
segment, which can theoretically provide a significantly tighter upper bound on
distillation error. Additionally, we propose a distillation pipeline for a more
swift and stable generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
SegmentDreamer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality, enabling
high-fidelity 3D asset creation through 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS).

Result: 在REA数据集上，ST-LLM显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ST-LLM有效提升了MLLMs的时空理解能力，为智能体在现实世界中的应用提供了支持。

Abstract: Despite the significant recent progress of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), MLLMs still struggle to correctly answer prompts that require a
holistic spatio-temporal understanding. Specifically, it is challenging to
address prompts that refer to 1) the entirety of an environment that an agent
equipped with an MLLM can operate in; and simultaneously also refer to 2)
recent actions that just happened and are encoded in a video clip. However,
such a holistic spatio-temporal understanding is important for agents operating
in the real world. To address this issue, we first develop a framework to
collect a large-scale dataset. Using the collected "Reasoning about
Environments and Actions" (REA) dataset, we show that recent methods indeed
struggle to correctly answer the prompts. To improve, we develop a
"spatio-temporal LLM" (ST-LLM), a model equipped with projectors to improve
both spatial understanding of an environment and temporal understanding of
recent observations. On the collected REA data, we show that the proposed
method significantly improves results compared to prior work. Code and data are

Abstract: Recent diffusion-based image editing methods have significantly advanced
text-guided tasks but often struggle to interpret complex, indirect
instructions. Moreover, current models frequently suffer from poor identity
preservation, unintended edits, or rely heavily on manual masks. To address
these challenges, we introduce X-Planner, a Multimodal Large Language Model
(MLLM)-based planning system that effectively bridges user intent with editing
model capabilities. X-Planner employs chain-of-thought reasoning to
systematically decompose complex instructions into simpler, clear
sub-instructions. For each sub-instruction, X-Planner automatically generates
precise edit types and segmentation masks, eliminating manual intervention and
ensuring localized, identity-preserving edits. Additionally, we propose a novel
automated pipeline for generating large-scale data to train X-Planner which
achieves state-of-the-art results on both existing benchmarks and our newly
introduced complex editing benchmark.

Conclusion: 研究表明人机协作在实物产品设计中具有潜力，为整合人类反馈到AI设计流程提供了宝贵见解。

Abstract: This study explores how Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning, guided by
human aesthetic evaluations, can enhance the outputs of generative AI models in
tangible product design, using lamp design as a case study. By integrating
human feedback into the AI model, we aim to improve both the desirability and
aesthetic appeal of the generated designs. Comprehensive experiments were
conducted, starting with prompt optimization techniques and focusing on LoRA
fine-tuning of the Stable Diffusion model. Additionally, methods to convert
AI-generated designs into tangible products through 3D realization using 3D
printing technologies were investigated. The results indicate that LoRA
fine-tuning effectively aligns AI-generated designs with human aesthetic
preferences, leading to significant improvements in desirability and aesthetic
appeal scores. These findings highlight the potential of human-AI collaboration
in tangible product design and provide valuable insights into integrating human
feedback into AI design processes.

### [245] [Engineering Trust, Creating Vulnerability: A Socio-Technical Analysis of AI Interface Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02866)
*Ben Kereopa-Yorke*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文探讨了AI跨学科文化如何通过界面设计形成，揭示了这些交叉点产生的新学科文化。通过IMCS框架，展示了网络安全工程、认知心理学、批判性技术研究和人机交互的碰撞如何超越传统学科边界。


<details>

Motivation: 研究动机在于揭示AI界面如何作为边界对象，促进跨学科方法融合，而非简单合作，并挑战传统学科边界和知识分离的假设。

Method: 采用IMCS框架，结合生成式AI平台的系统视觉分析和公共、医疗及教育领域的案例研究，识别了四种认知安全漏洞向量。

Result: 研究发现四种漏洞向量（反射模拟、权威调节、认知负荷利用和市场-安全张力），并证明界面是知识碰撞的场所，传统学科方法不足以分析复杂的社会技术现象。

Conclusion: 结论指出界面作为跨学科文化形成的场所，挑战了学科边界、知识分离和形式化整合的假设，强调文化机制在学科融合中的重要性。

Abstract: This paper examines how distinct cultures of AI interdisciplinarity emerge
through interface design, revealing the formation of new disciplinary cultures
at these intersections. Through the Interface-Mediated Cognitive Security
(IMCS) framework, I demonstrate how the collision of cybersecurity engineering,
cognitive psychology, critical technology studies, and human-computer
interaction generates research cultures that transcend traditional disciplinary
boundaries. AI interfaces function as transformative boundary objects that
necessitate methodological fusion rather than mere collaboration,
simultaneously embodying technical architectures, psychological design
patterns, and social interaction models. Through systematic visual analysis of
generative AI platforms and case studies across public sector, medical, and
educational domains, I identify four vulnerability vectors, Reflection
Simulation, Authority Modulation, Cognitive Load Exploitation, and
Market-Security Tension, that structure interface-mediated cognitive security.
This research challenges three significant gaps in interdisciplinary theory:
the assumption that disciplines maintain distinct methodological boundaries
during collaboration, the belief that technical and social knowledge practices
can be cleanly separated, and the presumption that disciplinary integration
occurs through formal rather than cultural mechanisms. The empirical evidence
demonstrates how interfaces function as sites of epistemological collision,
creating methodological pressure zones where traditional disciplinary
approaches prove insufficient for analysing the complex socio-technical
phenomena at the interface.

Motivation: 传统PCPs在多指标情况下难以通过颜色渐变直观展示关系，且线性加权方法缺乏用户友好性。

Method: 提出基于特定偏好指标组合的权重优化公式，使用雷达图和UMAP降维实现多指标偏好选择的可视化。

Result: 在行人流引导规划中，方法成功识别了不同用户偏好下控制参数的重要性模式。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多指标PCPs的可视化和用户偏好选择问题。

Abstract: Parallel coordinate plots (PCPs) are a prevalent method to interpret the
relationship between the control parameters and metrics. PCPs deliver such an
interpretation by color gradation based on a single metric. However, it is
challenging to provide such a gradation when multiple metrics are present.
Although a naive approach involves calculating a single metric by linearly
weighting each metric, such weighting is unclear for users. To address this
problem, we first propose a principled formulation for calculating the optimal
weight based on a specific preferred metric combination. Although users can
simply select their preference from a two-dimensional (2D) plane for bi-metric
problems, multi-metric problems require intuitive visualization to allow them
to select their preference. We achieved this using various radar charts to
visualize the metric trade-offs on the 2D plane reduced by UMAP. In the
analysis using pedestrian flow guidance planning, our method identified unique
patterns of control parameter importance for each user preference, highlighting
the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Healthcare professionals need effective ways to use, understand, and validate
AI-driven clinical decision support systems. Existing systems face two key
limitations: complex visualizations and a lack of grounding in scientific
evidence. We present an integrated decision support system that combines
interactive visualizations with a conversational agent to explain diabetes risk
assessments. We propose a hybrid prompt handling approach combining fine-tuned
language models for analytical queries with general Large Language Models
(LLMs) for broader medical questions, a methodology for grounding AI
explanations in scientific evidence, and a feature range analysis technique to
support deeper understanding of feature contributions. We conducted a
mixed-methods study with 30 healthcare professionals and found that the
conversational interactions helped healthcare professionals build a clear
understanding of model assessments, while the integration of scientific
evidence calibrated trust in the system's decisions. Most participants reported
that the system supported both patient risk evaluation and recommendation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 慢性病患者药物不依从性导致健康问题恶化，亟需创新方法改善这一现象。

Method: 使用Amazon Mechanical Turk招募243名参与者，分为游戏组和宣传册组，通过前后测试对比效果。

Result: 游戏组在干预后测试中得分显著提高，游戏时长与得分呈正相关趋势。

Conclusion: 互动手机游戏有望成为提高药物依从性的有效工具，未来研究可进一步优化和推广。

Abstract: Noncompliance with medication regimens poses an immense challenge in the
management of chronic diseases, often resulting in exacerbated health
complications and recurrent hospital admissions. Addressing this gap, our team
designed an innovative mobile game aimed at bolstering medication adherence and
information retention within the general population. Employing Amazon
Mechanical Turk, participants were enlisted and allocated into two cohorts: one
engaged with our mobile game and the other perused an informational pamphlet
about medication. Both cohorts underwent a pre-intervention quiz, followed by
their respective interventions, and concluded with a post-intervention quiz.
Primary outcome measures included the difference in quiz scores and the game
play duration. The investigation encompassed 243 participants with homogenous
baseline attributes. Participants interacting with the mobile game depicted a
significant enhancement in their post-intervention scores compared to the
pre-intervention scores. We observed a notable correlation of 0.346 (p<0.001)
with a robust medium effect size of 0.641 (0.503 - 0.779). Although the
duration of game play and post-intervention scores didn't exhibit a direct
correlation, a tendency towards superior post-intervention scores was evident
among participants who dedicated more time to the game. The interactive mobile
game we developed exhibits potential as an engaging instrument for empowering
patients and caregivers. Providing critical medication information and the
potential side effects in a manner that increases retention would thereby
mitigate medication noncompliance. Future research endeavors should focus on
optimizing and broadening the application of such mobile interfaces to fortify
public health initiatives.

Motivation: 当前数字人类生成的瓶颈在于如何根据文本或语音输入生成自然的角色动作。

Method: DeepGesture基于DiffuseStyleGesture模型，引入快速文本转录作为语义条件，并采用情感引导的无分类器扩散方法，结合轻量级Transformer架构。

Result: 在ZeroEGGS数据集上，DeepGesture在手势的自然性和上下文适当性上优于基线，支持情感状态插值和泛化到分布外语音。

Conclusion: DeepGesture在实现多模态、情感感知的数字人类方面迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Along with the explosion of large language models, improvements in speech
synthesis, advancements in hardware, and the evolution of computer graphics,
the current bottleneck in creating digital humans lies in generating character
movements that correspond naturally to text or speech inputs.
  In this work, we present DeepGesture, a diffusion-based gesture synthesis
framework for generating expressive co-speech gestures conditioned on
multimodal signals-text, speech, emotion, and seed motion. Built upon the
DiffuseStyleGesture model, DeepGesture introduces novel architectural
enhancements that improve semantic alignment and emotional expressiveness in
generated gestures. Specifically, we integrate fast text transcriptions as
semantic conditioning and implement emotion-guided classifier-free diffusion to
support controllable gesture generation across affective states. A lightweight
Transformer backbone combines full self-attention and cross-local attention for
effective feature fusion of heterogeneous modalities. To visualize results, we
implement a full rendering pipeline in Unity based on BVH output from the
model. Evaluation on the ZeroEGGS dataset shows that DeepGesture produces
gestures with improved human-likeness and contextual appropriateness,
outperforming baselines on Mean Opinion Score and Frechet Gesture Distance
metrics. Our system supports interpolation between emotional states and
demonstrates generalization to out-of-distribution speech, including synthetic
voices-marking a step forward toward fully multimodal, emotionally aware
digital humans.

Result: 相比八种现有工具，该方法提升了表达力、减少了创作工作量，并支持便携式注释工作流。

Conclusion: 该方法为注释提供了结构化、可复用的解决方案。

Abstract: Annotations are central to effective data communication, yet most
visualization tools treat them as secondary constructs -- manually defined,
difficult to reuse, and loosely coupled to the underlying visualization
grammar. We propose a declarative extension to Wilkinson's Grammar of Graphics
that reifies annotations as first-class design elements, enabling structured
specification of annotation targets, types, and positioning strategies. To
demonstrate the utility of our approach, we develop a prototype extension
called Vega-Lite Annotation. Through comparison with eight existing tools, we
show that our approach enhances expressiveness, reduces authoring effort, and
enables portable, semantically integrated annotation workflows.

Conclusion: 研究结果为充电站运营商、政策制定者和制造商提供了改进用户体验和推广电动汽车的实用建议。

Abstract: Electric vehicles (EVs) charging infrastructure is directly related to the
overall EV user experience and thus impacts the widespread adoption of EVs.
Understanding key factors that affect EV users' charging experience is
essential for building a robust and user-friendly EV charging infrastructure.
This study leverages about $17,000$ charging station (CS) reviews on Google
Maps to explore EV user preferences for charging stations, employing ChatGPT
4.0 for aspect-based sentiment analysis. We identify twelve key aspects
influencing user satisfaction, ranging from accessibility and reliability to
amenities and pricing. Two distinct preference models are developed: a
micro-level model focused on individual user satisfaction and a macro-level
model capturing collective sentiment towards specific charging stations. Both
models utilize the LightGBM algorithm for user preference prediction, achieving
strong performance compared to other machine learning approaches. To further
elucidate the impact of each aspect on user ratings, we employ SHAP (SHapley
Additive exPlanations), a game-theoretic approach for interpreting machine
learning models. Our findings highlight the significant impact of positive
sentiment towards "amenities and location", coupled with negative sentiment
regarding "reliability and maintenance", on overall user satisfaction. These
insights offer actionable guidance to charging station operators, policymakers,
and EV manufacturers, empowering them to enhance user experience and foster
wider EV adoption.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI创意工具缺乏对发散和收敛过程的复杂协调支持，而人类创意构思需要两者的结合。

Method: Reverger通过递归探索故事修改的高层方向（发散）和将这些方向综合为具体变体（收敛），支持用户迭代操作。

Result: 用户研究表明，Reverger比基线工具更能探索意外和多样化的方向，用户感觉控制更精细且发现更有价值的成果。

Conclusion: Reverger通过支持发散与收敛的灵活迭代，提升了创意构思的效果和用户体验。

Abstract: Human creative ideation involves both exploration of diverse ideas
(divergence) and selective synthesis of explored ideas into coherent
combinations (convergence). While processes of divergence and convergence are
often interleaved and nested, existing AI-powered creativity support tools
(CSTs) lack support for sophisticated orchestration of divergence and
convergence. We present Reverger, an AI-powered CST that helps users ideate
variations of conceptual directions for modifying a story by scaffolding
flexible iteration between divergence and convergence. For divergence, our tool
enables recursive exploration of alternative high-level directions for
modifying a specific part of the original story. For convergence, it allows
users to collect explored high-level directions and synthesize them into
concrete variations. Users can then iterate between divergence and convergence
until they find a satisfactory outcome. A within-subject study revealed that
Reverger permitted participants to explore more unexpected and diverse
high-level directions than a comparable baseline. Reverger users also felt that
they had more fine-grained control and discovered more effort-worthy outcomes.

Method: 设计实验，让玩家玩故意制造困惑的游戏原型，收集学习相关的情感数据，并与复杂学习模型对比。

Result: 实验证实玩家体验与学习体验在某些情况下一致，并发现这些情感与玩家体验量表（如心流体验）相关。

Conclusion: 困惑在特定情况下对玩家学习体验有积极影响，值得进一步研究。

Abstract: Video game designers often view confusion as undesirable, yet it is
inevitable, as new players must adapt to new interfaces and mechanics in an
increasingly varied and innovative game market, which is more popular than
ever. Research suggests that confusion can contribute to a positive experience,
potentially motivating players to learn. The state of confusion in video games
should be further investigated to gain more insight into the learning
experience of play and how it affects the player experience. In this article,
we design a study to collect learning-related affects for users playing a game
prototype that intentionally confuses the player. We assess the gathered
affects against a complex learning model, affirming that, in specific
instances, the player experience aligns with the learning experiences.
Moreover, we identify correlations between these affects and the Player
Experience Inventory constructs, particularly concerning flow experiences.

Abstract: Sleep is important for everyday functioning, overall well-being, and quality
of life. Recent advances in wearable sensing technology have enabled
continuous, noninvasive, and cost-effective monitoring of sleep patterns in
real-world natural living settings. Wrist-worn devices, in particular, are
capable of tracking sleep patterns using accelerometers and heart rate sensors.
To support sleep research in naturalistic environments using wearable sensors,
we introduce the TILES-2018 Sleep Benchmark dataset, which we make publicly
available to the research community. This dataset was collected over a 10-week
period from 139 hospital employees and includes over 6,000 unique sleep
recordings, alongside self-reported survey data from each participant, which
includes sleep quality, stress, and anxiety among other measurements. We
present in-depth analyses of sleep patterns by combining the TILES-2018 Sleep
Benchmark dataset with a previously released dataset (TILES-2018), which
follows a similar study protocol. Our analyses include sleep duration, sleep
stages, and sleep diaries. Moreover, we report machine learning benchmarks
using this dataset as a testbed for tasks including sleep stage classification,
prediction of self-reported sleep quality, and classifying demographics.
Overall, this dataset provides a valuable resource for advancing foundational
studies in sleep behavior modeling.

Motivation: 研究如何通过界面设计鼓励用户输入更长的提示，以增强其对生成内容的所有权感。

Method: 采用两种交互技术（长按提交按钮和滑动条操作）进行实验，并进一步测试AI生成扩展建议的效果。

Result: 实验显示，界面修改显著增加了提示长度并提升了心理所有权，但AI建议仅增加长度，未改善所有权感。

Conclusion: 简单的界面修改能有效促使用户输入更多内容并增强心理所有权，而AI建议仅对长度有额外帮助。

Abstract: Writing longer prompts for an AI assistant to generate a short story
increases psychological ownership, a user's feeling that the writing belongs to
them. To encourage users to write longer prompts, we evaluated two interaction
techniques that modify the prompt entry interface of chat-based generative AI
assistants: pressing and holding the prompt submission button, and continuously
moving a slider up and down when submitting a short prompt. A within-subjects
experiment investigated the effects of such techniques on prompt length and
psychological ownership, and results showed that these techniques increased
prompt length and led to higher psychological ownership than baseline
techniques. A second experiment further augmented these techniques by showing
AI-generated suggestions for how the prompts could be expanded. This further
increased prompt length, but did not lead to improvements in psychological
ownership. Our results show that simple interface modifications like these can
elicit more writing from users and improve psychological ownership.

Abstract: This paper investigates the viability of Wave Field Synthesis (WFS) for
enhancing auditory immersion in VR-based cognitive research. While Virtual
Reality (VR) offers significant advantages for studying human perception and
behavior, auditory cues are often underutilized. WFS, an advanced audio
rendering technique, can create highly realistic and spatially accurate
soundscapes, potentially increasing ecological validity. This study evaluates
WFS by implementing a sample experiment where participants localize static and
moving sound sources in both a WFS-rendered environment and a conventional
stereo headphone setup. The research explores the impact of virtual
environments, sound types, and durations on localization accuracy and search
behavior. Findings indicate that while stereo setups can achieve higher
accuracy, WFS provides a more natural and intuitive auditory experience,
particularly for directional cues. The study also highlights limitations of
current WFS systems, such as the lack of height localization, occlusion
simulation, and user-dependent optimization, which affect performance,
especially for centrally located sound sources. Despite these challenges, WFS
shows promise for specialized auditory perception research, particularly for
complex soundscapes where directional information is paramount.

*Nuo Chen,Pu Yan,Jia Li,Qixuan Zhao*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究分析了2024年流行的社交聊天机器人Robert的自主评论行为，揭示了其对人类与AI互动的情感影响和社会技术意义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨自主AI在社交媒体中的参与如何重塑人机互动，尤其是情感层面的影响。

Method: 采用计算语言学技术（如主题分类和情感分析），分析了3900条用户与Robert的互动数据。

Result: 主题建模发现六大主题，情感分析显示Robert的评论既可能引发温暖幽默，也可能隐含敌意，揭示了人机情感鸿沟。

Conclusion: 研究表明，尽管Robert模拟了社交存在，但未能满足用户情感需求，为AI在公共领域的参与提供了新见解。

Abstract: Since its viral emergence in early 2024, Comment Robert-a Weibo-launched
social chatbot-has gained widespread attention on the Chinese Internet for its
unsolicited and unpredictable comments on user posts. Unlike conventional
chatbots that respond only to user prompts, Robert autonomously intervenes in
public discourse, representing a novel form of AI-driven social media
engagement. This study examines how such autonomous, algorithmic communication
reshapes human-AI interaction in everyday online contexts. Using computational
linguistics techniques, including topic classification and sentiment analysis,
we analyze over 3,900 user-submitted interactions from the "Robert Victims
Alliance", a grassroots community documenting their exchanges with the chatbot.
Topic modeling reveals six key themes: interpersonal relationships,
self-identity, academic and career concerns, subcultures, sensitive topics, and
social events. Complementing this, mixed-methods emotional analysis uncovers a
complex affective spectrum: Robert's casual remarks can evoke warmth and humor
but may also conceal covert hostility beneath neutral or polite language. These
ambivalent interactions reveal an emerging emotional divide between humans and
socially proactive AI, suggesting that while Robert simulates social presence,
it often falls short of users' emotional needs. Our study contributes to
human-AI interaction research by offering new insights into the affective
dynamics and socio-technical implications of unsolicited AI bots' participation
in digital public spheres.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: COVID-19大流行使视频会议成为日常生活的重要组成部分，但其局限性导致沟通和社会行为支持不足，引发“Zoom疲劳”。需要新技术解决这些问题。

Method: 首先调查视频会议系统的不足，评估支持沟通行为的方法，并建议将这些方法用于改进视频会议技术。随后调查新兴XR解决方案。

Result: 论文总结了视频会议的局限性，并提出了XR技术作为潜在解决方案，尤其是那些不依赖头戴式显示器的技术。

Conclusion: 未来研究应开发和测试XR技术以改进视频会议，并采用现有评估方法来验证这些技术的有效性。

Abstract: Video conferencing has become a central part of our daily lives, thanks to
the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, so have its many limitations, resulting
in poor support for communicative and social behavior and ultimately, Zoom
fatigue. New technologies will be required to address these limitations,
including many drawn from mixed reality (XR). In this paper, our goals are to
equip and encourage future researchers to develop and test such technologies.
Toward this end, we first survey research on the shortcomings of video
conferencing systems, as defined before and after the pandemic. We then
consider the methods that research uses to evaluate support for communicative
behavior, and argue that those same methods should be employed in identifying,
improving, and validating promising video conferencing technologies. Next, we
survey emerging XR solutions to video conferencing's limitations, most off
which do not employ head-mounted displays.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 化妆对自我表达和自信至关重要，但现有辅助工具未能满足视障人士在化妆流程中的复杂需求。

Method: 通过15位视障化妆用户的实地调查和5位专业化妆师的访谈，分析化妆行为、需求及反馈方式。

Result: 研究发现视障用户依赖触觉策略，面临对称性和评估挑战，需要实时、目标导向的反馈。

Conclusion: 提出了非视觉化妆反馈需求的分类，并设计未来辅助系统的方向，强调免提、对话式交互和情境感知支持。

Abstract: Makeup plays a vital role in self-expression, identity, and confidence - yet
remains an underexplored domain for assistive technology, especially for people
with vision impairments. While existing tools support isolated tasks such as
color identification or product labeling, they rarely address the procedural
complexity of makeup routines: coordinating step sequences, managing product
placement, and assessing the final look with accessible feedback. To understand
the real-world process, we conducted a contextual inquiry with 15 visually
impaired makeup users, capturing real-time makeup application behaviors and
their step-by-step information needs and assessment approaches. Our findings
reveal embodied, tactile-first strategies; persistent challenges in blending,
symmetry, and assessment; and a desire for honest, real-time, goal-aligned
feedback. We also interviewed five professional makeup artists, who reviewed
participant makeup videos and provided expert responses to participant-raised
questions and assessment practices. We contribute a taxonomy of feedback needs
in non-visual makeup, and outline design implications for future assistive
systems - emphasizing hands-free, conversational interaction and context-aware,
procedural support for expressive and independent beauty practices.

Motivation: 心理学和人机交互领域对高效且不易察觉的人格评估方法需求日益增长，研究旨在探索一种交互式评估方法，关注人格表征的多样性。

Method: 提出Multi-PR GPA框架，利用大语言模型创建多样化性格的虚拟代理，通过互动游戏生成多类型文本数据，实现直接评估和基于队列的评估。

Result: 原型系统实验结果表明，该方法在人格评估中有效，且在考虑人格表征多样性时表现更优。

Conclusion: Multi-PR GPA框架为高效、多维度的人格评估提供了新思路，验证了其在实践中的潜力。

Abstract: The execution of effective and imperceptible personality assessments is
receiving increasing attention in psychology and human-computer interaction
fields. This study explores an interactive approach for personality assessment,
focusing on the multiplicity of personality representation. We propose a
framework of gamified personality assessment through multi-personality
representations (Multi-PR GPA). The framework leverages Large Language Models
to empower virtual agents with diverse personalities. These agents elicit
multifaceted human personality representations through engaging in interactive
games. Drawing upon the multi-type textual data generated throughout the
interaction, it achieves two ways of personality assessments (i.e., Direct
Assessment and Que-based Assessment) and provides interpretable insights.
Grounded in the classic Big Five theory, we implemented a prototype system and
conducted a user study to assess the efficacy of Multi-PR GPA. The results
underscore the effectiveness of our approach in personality assessment and
demonstrate that it achieves superior performance when considering the
multiplicity of personality representation.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型在教育工具中的普及，研究其交互方式对用户表现的影响具有重要意义。

Method: 采用被试内实验设计，15名高中生在不同交互风格的ChatGPT-4o支持下完成编程任务。

Result: 协作交互风格显著缩短任务完成时间，用户满意度和感知帮助性也更高。

Conclusion: 设计更互动、自适应和以用户为中心的LLM对新手程序员的学习和表现至关重要。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more common in educational tools and
programming environments, questions arise about how these systems should
interact with users. This study investigates how different interaction styles
with ChatGPT-4o (passive, proactive, and collaborative) affect user performance
on simple programming tasks. I conducted a within-subjects experiment where
fifteen high school students participated, completing three problems under
three distinct versions of the model. Each version was designed to represent a
specific style of AI support: responding only when asked, offering suggestions
automatically, or engaging the user in back-and-forth dialogue.Quantitative
analysis revealed that the collaborative interaction style significantly
improved task completion time compared to the passive and proactive conditions.
Participants also reported higher satisfaction and perceived helpfulness when
working with the collaborative version. These findings suggest that the way an
LLM communicates, how it guides, prompts, and responds, can meaningfully impact
learning and performance. This research highlights the importance of designing
LLMs that go beyond functional correctness to support more interactive,
adaptive, and user-centered experiences, especially for novice programmers.

Motivation: 随着第四工业革命中社交机器人的普及，人类与机器人的互动问题逐渐显现，需要一种以人为中心的框架来满足用户需求。

Method: 基于以人为中心的人工智能原则，构建了“双金字塔”框架，涵盖从微观到宏观的人类需求。

Result: 提出了一个全面的需求层次模型，从机器人有效性到联合国可持续发展目标的协作。

Conclusion: “双金字塔”框架为机器人设计提供了以人为中心的指导，满足从个体到社会的多层次需求。

Abstract: Modern social robots can be considered the descendants of steam engines from
the First Industrial Revolution (IR 1.0) and industrial robotic arms from the
Third Industrial Revolution (IR 3.0). As some time has passed since the
introduction of these robots during the Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR 4.0),
challenges and issues in their interaction with humans have emerged, leading
researchers to conclude that, like any other AI-based technology, these robots
must also be human-centered to meet the needs of their users. This chapter aims
to introduce humans and their needs in interactions with robots, ranging from
short-term, one-on-one interactions (micro-level) to long-term, macro-level
needs at the societal scale. Building upon the principles of human-centered AI,
this chapter presents, for the first time, a new framework of human needs
called the Dual Pyramid. This framework encompasses a comprehensive list of
human needs in robot interactions, from the most fundamental, robot
effectiveness to macro level requirements, such as the collaboration with
robots in achieving the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals.

TL;DR: HyperSumm-RL是一个超文本感知的摘要与交互分析框架，用于研究人类对社交机器人领导力的感知，通过长对话分析动态交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究社交机器人在复杂人机交互（HRI）中的领导力表现，弥补以往静态或任务导向HRI研究的不足。

Method: 结合基于Transformer的长对话摘要、领导风格建模和用户响应分析，构建可扩展的HRI评估框架。

Result: 开发了支持对话主题、参与者响应和机器人行为模式关系导航的交互式超文本模型，并验证其在分析信任、参与度和期望变化中的实用性。

Conclusion: 超文本工作流可增强HRI研究的透明度和可解释性，为动态社交分析提供语义基础。

Abstract: This paper introduces HyperSumm-RL, a hypertext-aware summarization and
interaction analysis framework designed to investigate human perceptions of
social robot leadership through long-form dialogue. The system utilizes a
structured Natural Language Processing (NLP) workflow that combines
transformer-based long dialogue summarization, leadership style modeling, and
user response analysis, enabling scalable evaluation of social robots in
complex human-robot interaction (HRI) settings. Unlike prior work that focuses
on static or task-oriented HRI, HyperSumm-RL captures and hypertextually
organizes dynamic conversational exchanges into navigable, semantically rich
representations which allows researchers to trace interaction threads, identify
influence cues, and analyze leadership framing over time. The contributions of
this study are threefold: (1) we present a novel infrastructure for summarizing
and linking long, multi-turn dialogues using leadership-style taxonomies; (2)
we propose an interactive hypertext model that supports relational navigation
across conversational themes, participant responses, and robot behavior modes;
and (3) we demonstrate the utility of this system in interpreting participant
trust, engagement, and expectation shifts during social robot leadership
scenarios. The findings reveal how hypertextual workflows can augment HRI
research by enabling transparent, interpretable, and semantically grounded
analysis of emergent social dynamics.

Motivation: 探索呼吸作为免提交互方式的潜力，提供一种新颖的交互技术。

Method: 使用生物阻抗技术检测呼吸手势，并通过两项实验室研究（n=34）评估系统。

Result: 高检测精度（F1分数>95.2%），用户认为手势易用且舒适，单次点击更受欢迎。

Conclusion: iBreath为呼吸手势交互研究奠定基础，提供实用设计指南。

Abstract: Breathing is a spontaneous but controllable body function that can be used
for hands-free interaction. Our work introduces "iBreath", a novel system to
detect breathing gestures similar to clicks using bio-impedance. We evaluated
iBreath's accuracy and user experience using two lab studies (n=34). Our
results show high detection accuracy (F1-scores > 95.2%). Furthermore, the
users found the gestures easy to use and comfortable. Thus, we developed eight
practical guidelines for the future development of breathing gestures. For
example, designers can train users on new gestures within just 50 seconds (five
trials), and achieve robust performance with both user-dependent and
user-independent models trained on data from 21 participants, each yielding
accuracies above 90%. Users preferred single clicks and disliked triple clicks.
The median gesture duration is 3.5-5.3 seconds. Our work provides solid ground
for researchers to experiment with creating breathing gestures and
interactions.

Motivation: 可穿戴智能设备的兴起为行为干预提供了新机会，但相关系统设计尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过设计空间探索、试点研究和原型开发（WSCoach系统），并与传统移动应用对比评估。

Result: WSCoach在长期减少不良词汇方面效果更佳。

Conclusion: 研究为可穿戴音频行为干预系统设计提供了指南，并展示了其在行为改善中的潜力。

Abstract: The rise of wearable smart devices raises unprecedented opportunities for
self-improvement through ubiquitous behavior tracking and guidance. However,
the design of effective wearable behavior intervention systems remains
relatively unexplored. To address this gap, we conducted controlled studies
focusing on the reduction of unwanted words (e.g., filler words, swear words)
in daily communication through auditory feedback using wearable technology. We
started with a design space exploration, considering various factors such as
the type, duration, and timing of the auditory feedback. Then, we conducted
pilot studies to reduce the space of design choices and prototyped a system
called WSCoach (Wearable Speech Coach), which informs users when they utter
unwanted words in near-real-time. To evaluate WSCoach, we compared it with a
state-of-the-art mobile application supporting post-hoc conversation analysis.
Both approaches were effective in reducing the occurrence of unwanted words,
but WSCoach appears to be more effective in the long run. Finally, we discuss
guidelines for the design of wearable audio-based behavior monitoring and
intervention systems and highlight the potential of wearable technology for
facilitating behavior correction and improvement. For supplementary material,

TL;DR: RunPacer是一种基于智能手表的触觉反馈系统，帮助视障跑者与引导跑者同步节奏，减少对语言或机械连接的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视障跑者通常需要引导跑者，但传统的同步方式（如语言或绳索）既费神又限制行动。现有解决方案忽视了跑步中的实时节奏协调。

Method: RunPacer通过智能手表提供同步的振动触觉反馈，预设目标步频或动态适应引导跑者的自然节奏，确保双方步调一致。

Result: 系统实现了轻量、社交合作且非视觉的辅助框架，使跑步成为共享、具身且无障碍的体验。

Conclusion: RunPacer为视障跑者提供了一种直观高效的同步跑步方式，未来可扩展多模态反馈。

Abstract: Visually impaired individuals often require a guide runner to safely
participate in outdoor running. However, maintaining synchronized pacing with
verbal cues or tethers can be mentally taxing and physically restrictive.
Existing solutions primarily focus on navigation or obstacle avoidance but
overlook the importance of real-time interpersonal rhythm coordination during
running. We introduce RunPacer, a smartwatch-based vibrotactile feedback system
that delivers synchronized rhythmic pulses to both runners. In contrast to
conventional guide-running systems that rely heavily on continuous verbal
communication or mechanical tethering, RunPacer emphasizes interpersonal
cadence alignment as its core interaction model. By pre-setting a target step
frequency or dynamically adapting to the guide's natural pace, the system
ensures that both runners receive identical haptic cues, enabling them to
maintain coordinated motion intuitively and efficiently. This poster presents
the system architecture, positions it within prior research on haptic
entrainment, and outlines the vision for future field deployment, including
potential multimodal feedback extensions. RunPacer contributes a lightweight,
socially cooperative, and non-visual assistive framework that reimagines
co-running as a shared, embodied, and accessible experience.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统情感识别方法依赖预定义分类或人工标注，灵活性差且成本高。DMER提供更灵活的表达方式，但评估困难。

Method: 提出DMER-Ranker，将‘预测-真实’比较改为‘预测-预测’比较，结合Bradley-Terry算法生成模型排名。还创建了DMER-Preference数据集。

Result: DMER-Ranker解决了评估问题，DMER-Preference为情感偏好预测提供了首个专用数据集。

Conclusion: DMER及其评估方法推动了情感识别领域发展，为更智能的人机交互奠定了基础。

Abstract: Descriptive Multimodal Emotion Recognition (DMER) is a newly proposed task
that aims to describe a person's emotional state using free-form natural
language. Unlike traditional discriminative methods that rely on predefined
emotion taxonomies, DMER provides greater flexibility in emotional expression,
enabling fine-grained and interpretable emotion representations. However, this
free-form prediction paradigm introduces significant challenges in evaluation.
Existing methods either depend on ground-truth descriptions that require
substantial manual effort or simplify the task by shifting the focus from
evaluating descriptions to evaluating emotion labels. However, the former
suffers from the labor-intensive collection of comprehensive descriptions,
while the latter overlooks critical aspects such as emotional temporal
dynamics, intensity, and uncertainty. To address these limitations, we propose
DMER-Ranker, a novel evaluation strategy that reformulates the traditional
``prediction-ground truth'' comparison into the ``prediction-prediction''
comparison, eliminating the need for ground-truth descriptions. We then employ
the Bradley-Terry algorithm to convert pairwise comparison results into
model-level rankings. Additionally, we explore the possibility of automatic
preference prediction and introduce DMER-Preference, the first preference
dataset specifically designed for human emotions. Our work advances the field
of DMER and lays the foundation for more intelligent human-computer interaction
systems.

Motivation: 探索学生GenAI素养和聊天机器人互动策略如何影响其独立多模态写作能力，以优化AI辅助教学。

Method: 采用比较研究设计，79名学生在被动和主动聊天机器人辅助下完成写作任务，随后独立写作，并从五个维度评估表现。

Result: 高GenAI素养显著预测独立写作表现，被动聊天机器人条件下效果更明显。

Conclusion: 强调将GenAI素养培训融入课程，并平衡外部支持与自主学习，以优化AI辅助教学效果。

Abstract: Academic writing increasingly involves multimodal tasks requiring students to
integrate visual information and textual arguments. While generative AI (GenAI)
tools, like ChatGPT, offer new pathways for supporting academic writing, little
is known about how students' GenAI literacy influences their independent
multimodal writing skills or how chatbot interaction strategies (passive
reactive vs. proactive scaffolding) impact learning. This study examined 79
higher education students' multimodal academic writing performance using a
comparative research design. Students completed writing tasks integrating
visual data under two chatbot-assisted conditions (passive vs. proactive) and
subsequently without AI assistance. Their writing performance was rigorously
evaluated across five dimensions, including insightfulness, visual data
integration, organisation, linguistic quality, and critical thinking. Ordinal
logistic regression and correlation analyses revealed that higher levels of
GenAI literacy significantly predicted stronger independent multimodal writing
performance immediately after AI assistance removal, particularly for students
using passive chatbots requiring active prompting. These results highlight the
critical role of GenAI literacy and specific chatbot interaction strategies in
shaping students' capacities for independent multimodal academic writing. Our
findings emphasise the need for purposeful integration of GenAI literacy
training into curricula and balancing external scaffolding support with
autonomous learning opportunities. This research offers valuable
recommendations for educators leveraging AI-enhanced pedagogies to optimise
student writing outcomes and technological engagement strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发AI工具以帮助教师识别团队协作中的问题或高效表现。

Result: 自动方法性能接近人工处理，但自动分割减少了数据粒度。

Conclusion: 自动方法可行，但需注意数据粒度的影响，以支持课堂协作学习。

Abstract: Collaborative Problem-Solving (CPS) markers capture key aspects of effective
teamwork, such as staying on task, avoiding interruptions, and generating
constructive ideas. An AI system that reliably detects these markers could help
teachers identify when a group is struggling or demonstrating productive
collaboration. Such a system requires an automated pipeline composed of
multiple components. In this work, we evaluate how CPS detection is impacted by
automating two critical components: transcription and speech segmentation. On
the public Weights Task Dataset (WTD), we find CPS detection performance with
automated transcription and segmentation methods is comparable to
human-segmented and manually transcribed data; however, we find the automated
segmentation methods reduces the number of utterances by 26.5%, impacting the
the granularity of the data. We discuss the implications for developing
AI-driven tools that support collaborative learning in classrooms.

ideation to evaluation. Common practices include prompt engineering,
human-in-the-loop workflows, and multimodal input. While LLMs are reshaping
design processes, challenges such as hallucination, prompt instability, and
limited explainability persist. Our findings highlight LLMs as emerging
collaborators in design, and we propose directions for the ethical, inclusive,

Conclusion: 该工作流程通过建立验证的计算工具和透明实践，为AI心理学研究的有效性提供了路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly being integrated into psychological
research as research tools, evaluation targets, human simulators, and cognitive
models. However, recent evidence reveals severe measurement unreliability:
Personality assessments collapse under factor analysis, moral preferences
reverse with punctuation changes, and theory-of-mind accuracy varies widely
with trivial rephrasing. These "measurement phantoms"--statistical artifacts
masquerading as psychological phenomena--threaten the validity of a growing
body of research. Guided by the dual-validity framework that integrates
psychometrics with causal inference, we present a six-stage workflow that
scales validity requirements to research ambition--using LLMs to code text
requires basic reliability and accuracy, while claims about psychological
properties demand comprehensive construct validation. Researchers must (1)
explicitly define their research goal and corresponding validity requirements,
(2) develop and validate computational instruments through psychometric
testing, (3) design experiments that control for computational confounds, (4)
execute protocols with transparency, (5) analyze data using methods appropriate
for non-independent observations, and (6) report findings within demonstrated
boundaries and use results to refine theory. We illustrate the workflow through

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大学生对ChatGPT信任的四个影响因素：用户属性、信任维度、任务背景和社会影响。结果显示，行为使用频率和任务类型对信任影响显著，而技术理解和社会态度也起关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解大学生对ChatGPT的信任机制，以优化其在学术环境中的使用。

Method: 混合方法研究，包括115名英国学生的问卷调查和4次半结构化访谈。

Result: 信任受任务类型、使用频率、技术理解和社会态度影响；技术专家仅在特定任务中信任更高。

Conclusion: 信任取决于任务可验证性、能力感知和伦理一致性，需加强透明度和用户教育。

Abstract: This mixed-methods inquiry examined four domains that shape university
students' trust in ChatGPT: user attributes, seven delineated trust dimensions,
task context, and perceived societal impact. Data were collected through a
survey of 115 UK undergraduate and postgraduate students and four complementary
semi-structured interviews. Behavioural engagement outweighed demographics:
frequent use increased trust, whereas self-reported understanding of
large-language-model mechanics reduced it. Among the dimensions, perceived
expertise and ethical risk were the strongest predictors of overall trust; ease
of use and transparency had secondary effects, while human-likeness and
reputation were non-significant. Trust was highly task-contingent; highest for
coding and summarising, lowest for entertainment and citation generation, yet
confidence in ChatGPT's referencing ability, despite known inaccuracies, was
the single strongest correlate of global trust, indicating automation bias.
Computer-science students surpassed peers only in trusting the system for
proofreading and writing, suggesting technical expertise refines rather than
inflates reliance. Finally, students who viewed AI's societal impact positively
reported the greatest trust, whereas mixed or negative outlooks dampened
confidence. These findings show that trust in ChatGPT hinges on task
verifiability, perceived competence, ethical alignment and direct experience,
and they underscore the need for transparency, accuracy cues and user education
when deploying LLMs in academic settings.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CDAVP的社会技术框架，旨在通过社区定义的价值多元主义解决AI系统中用户代理缺失和价值单一化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统缺乏对价值多元化的考虑，且用户无法挑战或塑造系统嵌入的价值观，导致合法性和信任危机。

Method: CDAVP框架允许社区定义和维护明确的价值配置文件，用户可动态激活这些配置，AI应用则透明解释并调解冲突。

Result: 该方法将设计问题从单一价值对齐转变为动态价值生态系统，增强了用户代理和算法问责。

Conclusion: 通过支持价值多元化和社区参与，CDAVP为实现真正以人为中心的AI提供了可行路径。

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-driven systems presents a fundamental challenge to
Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Computer-Supported Cooperative Work
(CSCW), often diminishing user agency and failing to account for value
pluralism. Current approaches to value alignment, which rely on centralized,
top-down definitions, lack the mechanisms for meaningful contestability. This
leaves users and communities unable to challenge or shape the values embedded
in the systems that govern their digital lives, creating a crisis of legitimacy
and trust. This paper introduces Community-Defined AI Value Pluralism (CDAVP),
a socio-technical framework that addresses this gap. It reframes the design
problem from achieving a single aligned state to infrastructuring a dynamic
ecosystem for value deliberation and application. At its core, CDAVP enables
diverse, self-organizing communities to define and maintain explicit value
profiles - rich, machine-readable representations that can encompass not only
preferences but also community-specific rights and duties. These profiles are
then contextually activated by the end-user, who retains ultimate control
(agency) over which values guide the AI's behavior. AI applications, in turn,
are designed to transparently interpret these profiles and moderate conflicts,
adhering to a set of non-negotiable, democratically-legitimated meta-rules. The
designer's role shifts from crafting static interfaces to becoming an architect
of participatory ecosystems. We argue that infrastructuring for pluralism is a
necessary pathway toward achieving robust algorithmic accountability and
genuinely contestable, human-centric AI.

Result: 实验表明MoDA显著提升了视频的多样性、真实感和效率。

Conclusion: MoDA通过改进的扩散方法实现了高效且真实的说话头生成，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Talking head generation with arbitrary identities and speech audio remains a
crucial problem in the realm of digital humans and the virtual metaverse.
Recently, diffusion models have become a popular generative technique in this
field with their strong generation and generalization capabilities. However,
several challenges remain for diffusion-based methods: 1) inefficient inference
and visual artifacts, which arise from the implicit latent space of Variational
Auto-Encoders (VAE), complicating the diffusion process; 2) authentic facial
expressions and head movements, resulting from insufficient multi-modal
information interaction. In this paper, MoDA handle these challenges by 1)
defines a joint parameter space to bridge motion generation and neural
rendering, and leverages flow matching to simplify the diffusion learning
process; 2) introduces a multi-modal diffusion architecture to model the
interaction among noisy motion, audio, and auxiliary conditions, ultimately
enhancing overall facial expressiveness. Subsequently, a coarse-to-fine fusion
strategy is adopted to progressively integrate different modalities, ensuring
effective integration across feature spaces. Experimental results demonstrate
that MoDA significantly improves video diversity, realism, and efficiency,
making it suitable for real-world applications.

Motivation: 解决3D网格局部编辑中需要用户输入（如涂鸦或边界框）的问题，实现自动化的高精度定位和纹理合成。

Method: 提出一种改进的分数蒸馏采样技术，结合预测的定位掩码和参考图像（称为定位调制图像引导），实现自动定位和纹理合成。

Result: 在多种3D网格和图像上验证了方法的有效性，能够生成全局一致且局部精确的编辑结果。

Conclusion: 3D PixBrush为3D网格的局部编辑提供了一种高效且无需用户干预的解决方案。

Abstract: We present 3D PixBrush, a method for performing image-driven edits of local
regions on 3D meshes. 3D PixBrush predicts a localization mask and a
synthesized texture that faithfully portray the object in the reference image.
Our predicted localizations are both globally coherent and locally precise.
Globally - our method contextualizes the object in the reference image and
automatically positions it onto the input mesh. Locally - our method produces
masks that conform to the geometry of the reference image. Notably, our method
does not require any user input (in the form of scribbles or bounding boxes) to
achieve accurate localizations. Instead, our method predicts a localization
mask on the 3D mesh from scratch. To achieve this, we propose a modification to
the score distillation sampling technique which incorporates both the predicted
localization and the reference image, referred to as localization-modulated
image guidance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed technique on a
wide variety of meshes and images.

Motivation: 时间变化体积数据的可视化因数据量大和时空特征复杂而具有挑战性，现有方法训练收敛慢。

Method: 设计基于特征的多分辨率Tesseract编码架构F-Hash，结合多级无冲突哈希函数，优化嵌入网格映射。

Result: F-Hash在多种时间变化体积数据集上实现了最先进的训练收敛速度，并优化了渲染效率。

Conclusion: F-Hash为时间变化体积数据的特征跟踪和演化可视化提供了统一的编码解决方案。

Abstract: Interactive time-varying volume visualization is challenging due to its
complex spatiotemporal features and sheer size of the dataset. Recent works
transform the original discrete time-varying volumetric data into continuous
Implicit Neural Representations (INR) to address the issues of compression,
rendering, and super-resolution in both spatial and temporal domains. However,
training the INR takes a long time to converge, especially when handling
large-scale time-varying volumetric datasets. In this work, we proposed F-Hash,
a novel feature-based multi-resolution Tesseract encoding architecture to
greatly enhance the convergence speed compared with existing input encoding
methods for modeling time-varying volumetric data. The proposed design
incorporates multi-level collision-free hash functions that map dynamic 4D
multi-resolution embedding grids without bucket waste, achieving high encoding
capacity with compact encoding parameters. Our encoding method is agnostic to
time-varying feature detection methods, making it a unified encoding solution
for feature tracking and evolution visualization. Experiments show the F-Hash
achieves state-of-the-art convergence speed in training various time-varying
volumetric datasets for diverse features. We also proposed an adaptive ray
marching algorithm to optimize the sample streaming for faster rendering of the
time-varying neural representation.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为PointAMaLR的自监督学习框架，通过注意力引导的多尺度局部重建提升点云处理的特征表示和精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型多关注高层编码器的重建任务，忽视了低层局部特征的有效利用，这些特征通常仅用于激活计算而非直接参与重建。

Method: PointAMaLR采用分层重建策略，低层关注细尺度特征恢复，高层处理粗尺度特征重建，并引入局部注意力模块增强语义特征理解。

Result: 在ModelNet、ShapeNet等基准数据集上，PointAMaLR在分类和重建任务中表现出色；在ScanObjectNN和S3DIS数据集上也取得竞争力强的性能。

Conclusion: PointAMaLR在多尺度语义理解和实际应用中均表现出高效性和实用性。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has emerged as a prominent research direction in
point cloud processing. While existing models predominantly concentrate on
reconstruction tasks at higher encoder layers, they often neglect the effective
utilization of low-level local features, which are typically employed solely
for activation computations rather than directly contributing to reconstruction
tasks. To overcome this limitation, we introduce PointAMaLR, a novel
self-supervised learning framework that enhances feature representation and
processing accuracy through attention-guided multi-scale local reconstruction.
PointAMaLR implements hierarchical reconstruction across multiple local
regions, with lower layers focusing on fine-scale feature restoration while
upper layers address coarse-scale feature reconstruction, thereby enabling
complex inter-patch interactions. Furthermore, to augment feature
representation capabilities, we incorporate a Local Attention (LA) module in
the embedding layer to enhance semantic feature understanding. Comprehensive
experiments on benchmark datasets ModelNet and ShapeNet demonstrate
PointAMaLR's superior accuracy and quality in both classification and
reconstruction tasks. Moreover, when evaluated on the real-world dataset
ScanObjectNN and the 3D large scene segmentation dataset S3DIS, our model
achieves highly competitive performance metrics. These results not only
validate PointAMaLR's effectiveness in multi-scale semantic understanding but
also underscore its practical applicability in real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚拟现实（VR）中的图像渲染对计算资源要求高，传统的注视点渲染技术虽然能减少渲染成本，但注视跟踪过程本身可能增加延迟。

Method: 采用3D高斯泼溅技术作为渲染算法，并行化注视跟踪和注视点渲染过程以降低延迟。

Result: A3FR能将端到端渲染延迟降低至多2倍，同时保持视觉质量。

Conclusion: A3FR框架有效解决了注视点渲染中的延迟问题，为VR应用提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Virtual reality (VR) significantly transforms immersive digital interfaces,
greatly enhancing education, professional practices, and entertainment by
increasing user engagement and opening up new possibilities in various
industries. Among its numerous applications, image rendering is crucial.
Nevertheless, rendering methodologies like 3D Gaussian Splatting impose high
computational demands, driven predominantly by user expectations for superior
visual quality. This results in notable processing delays for real-time image
rendering, which greatly affects the user experience. Additionally, VR devices
such as head-mounted displays (HMDs) are intricately linked to human visual
behavior, leveraging knowledge from perception and cognition to improve user
experience. These insights have spurred the development of foveated rendering,
a technique that dynamically adjusts rendering resolution based on the user's
gaze direction. The resultant solution, known as gaze-tracked foveated
rendering, significantly reduces the computational burden of the rendering
process.
  Although gaze-tracked foveated rendering can reduce rendering costs, the
computational overhead of the gaze tracking process itself can sometimes
outweigh the rendering savings, leading to increased processing latency. To
address this issue, we propose an efficient rendering framework
called~\textit{A3FR}, designed to minimize the latency of gaze-tracked foveated
rendering via the parallelization of gaze tracking and foveated rendering
processes. For the rendering algorithm, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting, a
state-of-the-art neural rendering technique. Evaluation results demonstrate
that A3FR can reduce end-to-end rendering latency by up to $2\times$ while
maintaining visual quality.

Abstract: Real-time hair simulation is a vital component in creating believable virtual
avatars, as it provides a sense of immersion and authenticity. The dynamic
behavior of hair, such as bouncing or swaying in response to character
movements like jumping or walking, plays a significant role in enhancing the
overall realism and engagement of virtual experiences. Current methods for
simulating hair have been constrained by two primary approaches: highly
optimized physics-based systems and neural methods. However, state-of-the-art
neural techniques have been limited to quasi-static solutions, failing to
capture the dynamic behavior of hair. This paper introduces a novel neural
method that breaks through these limitations, achieving efficient and stable
dynamic hair simulation while outperforming existing approaches. We propose a
fully self-supervised method which can be trained without any manual
intervention or artist generated training data allowing the method to be
integrated with hair reconstruction methods to enable automatic end-to-end
methods for avatar reconstruction. Our approach harnesses the power of compact,
memory-efficient neural networks to simulate hair at the strand level, allowing
for the simulation of diverse hairstyles without excessive computational
resources or memory requirements. We validate the effectiveness of our method
through a variety of hairstyle examples, showcasing its potential for
real-world applications.

Result: 在X-ARES测试集上表现与wav2vec 2.0和data2vec相当，但仅需不到五分之一的训练数据且无需超参数调整。

Conclusion: Audio-JEPA是一种高效且数据需求低的音频自监督学习方法，代码和预训练模型将开源。

Abstract: Building on the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) paradigm, a
recent self-supervised learning framework that predicts latent representations
of masked regions in high-level feature spaces, we propose Audio-JEPA (Audio
Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture), tailored specifically for audio data.
Audio-JEPA uses a simple Vision Transformer backbone to predict latent
representations of masked spectrogram patches rather than reconstructing raw
audio. We pre-train on unlabeled AudioSet clips (10s, 32kHz) with random patch
masking on mel-spectrograms. We evaluate on the X-ARES suite covering speech,
music, and environmental sound tasks. Although our implementation is a
straightforward translation of the original model to audio, the results still
show comparable performance to wav2vec 2.0 and data2vec while using less than
one-fifth of their training data and with no hyper-parameter tuning. All code
and pretrained checkpoints will be released on GitHub.

Conclusion: 该方法为语音情感识别提供了高效解决方案，展现了深度学习在真实场景中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) traditionally relies on auditory data
analysis for emotion classification. Several studies have adopted different
methods for SER. However, existing SER methods often struggle to capture subtle
emotional variations and generalize across diverse datasets. In this article,
we use Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) as spectral features to
bridge the gap between computational emotion processing and human auditory
perception. To further improve robustness and feature diversity, we propose a
novel 1D-CNN-based SER framework that integrates data augmentation techniques.
MFCC features extracted from the augmented data are processed using a 1D
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture enhanced with channel and
spatial attention mechanisms. These attention modules allow the model to
highlight key emotional patterns, enhancing its ability to capture subtle
variations in speech signals. The proposed method delivers cutting-edge
performance, achieving the accuracy of 97.49% for SAVEE, 99.23% for RAVDESS,
89.31% for CREMA-D, 99.82% for TESS, 99.53% for EMO-DB, and 96.39% for EMOVO.
Experimental results show new benchmarks in SER, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our approach in recognizing emotional expressions with high
precision. Our evaluation demonstrates that the integration of advanced Deep
Learning (DL) methods substantially enhances generalization across diverse
datasets, underscoring their potential to advance SER for real-world deployment
in assistive technologies and human-computer interaction.

Abstract: Speaker generation task aims to create unseen speaker voice without reference
speech. The key to the task is defining a speaker space that represents diverse
speakers to determine the generated speaker trait. However, the effective way
to define this speaker space remains unclear. Eigenvoice synthesis is one of
the promising approaches in the traditional parametric synthesis framework,
such as HMM-based methods, which define a low-dimensional speaker space using
pre-stored speaker features. This study proposes a novel DNN-based eigenvoice
synthesis method via model editing. Unlike prior methods, our method defines a
speaker space in the DNN model parameter space. By directly sampling new DNN
model parameters in this space, we can create diverse speaker voices.
Experimental results showed the capability of our method to generate diverse
speakers' speech. Moreover, we discovered a gender-dominant axis in the created
speaker space, indicating the potential to control speaker attributes.

Method: 提出了一种与说话者无关的情感向量，能够捕捉多说话者共享的情感表达，适用于任意说话者。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在跨说话者情感强度控制中成功保持了说话者一致性、语音质量和可控性，即使在未见过的说话者情况下也有效。

Conclusion: 该方法通过引入与说话者无关的情感向量，有效解决了跨说话者情感强度控制的挑战。

Abstract: Cross-speaker emotion intensity control aims to generate emotional speech of
a target speaker with desired emotion intensities using only their neutral
speech. A recently proposed method, emotion arithmetic, achieves emotion
intensity control using a single-speaker emotion vector. Although this prior
method has shown promising results in the same-speaker setting, it lost speaker
consistency in the cross-speaker setting due to mismatches between the emotion
vector of the source and target speakers. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a speaker-agnostic emotion vector designed to capture shared emotional
expressions across multiple speakers. This speaker-agnostic emotion vector is
applicable to arbitrary speakers. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method succeeds in cross-speaker emotion intensity control while
maintaining speaker consistency, speech quality, and controllability, even in
the unseen speaker case.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Abstract: Sound-tracking refers to the process of determining the direction from which
a sound originates, making it a fundamental component of sound source
localization. This capability is essential in a variety of applications,
including security systems, acoustic monitoring, and speaker tracking, where
accurately identifying the direction of a sound source enables real-time
responses, efficient resource allocation, and improved situational awareness.
While sound-tracking is closely related to localization, it specifically
focuses on identifying the direction of the sound source rather than estimating
its exact position in space. Despite its utility, sound-tracking systems face
several challenges, such as maintaining directional accuracy and precision,
along with the need for sophisticated hardware configurations and complex
signal processing algorithms. This paper presents a sound-tracking method using
three electret microphones. We estimate the direction of a sound source using a
lightweight method that analyzes signals from three strategically placed
microphones. By comparing the average power of the received signals, the system
infers the most probable direction of the sound. The results indicate that the
power level from each microphone effectively determines the sound source
direction. Our system employs a straightforward and cost-effective hardware
design, ensuring simplicity and affordability in implementation. It achieves a
localization error of less than 6 degrees and a precision of 98%. Additionally,
its effortless integration with various systems makes it versatile and
adaptable. Consequently, this technique presents a robust and reliable solution
for sound-tracking and localization, with potential applications spanning
diverse domains such as security systems, smart homes, and acoustic monitoring.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 论文探讨了部分音频深度伪造定位的挑战，批评了当前评估方法（如EER）的局限性，并提出将其重构为序列异常检测问题，使用更实用的阈值依赖指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 部分音频深度伪造定位的研究较少，且现有方法在真实场景中的实用性不明确，需改进评估方法。

Method: 将定位任务重构为序列异常检测问题，使用阈值依赖指标（如准确率、精确率、召回率和F1分数）评估。

Result: CFPRF模型在域内表现良好（EER 7.61%），但在域外表现较差（43.25%和27.59%）。

Conclusion: 过度优化域内EER可能导致模型在真实场景中表现不佳，需关注域外泛化能力，部分伪造数据有助于提升性能。

Abstract: Partial audio deepfake localization pose unique challenges and remain
underexplored compared to full-utterance spoofing detection. While recent
methods report strong in-domain performance, their real-world utility remains
unclear. In this analysis, we critically examine the limitations of current
evaluation practices, particularly the widespread use of Equal Error Rate
(EER), which often obscures generalization and deployment readiness. We propose
reframing the localization task as a sequential anomaly detection problem and
advocate for the use of threshold-dependent metrics such as accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1-score, which better reflect real-world behavior.
Specifically, we analyze the performance of the open-source Coarse-to-Fine
Proposal Refinement Framework (CFPRF), which achieves a 20-ms EER of 7.61% on
the in-domain PartialSpoof evaluation set, but 43.25% and 27.59% on the
LlamaPartialSpoof and Half-Truth out-of-domain test sets. Interestingly, our
reproduced version of the same model performs worse on in-domain data (9.84%)
but better on the out-of-domain sets (41.72% and 14.98%, respectively). This
highlights the risks of over-optimizing for in-domain EER, which can lead to
models that perform poorly in real-world scenarios. It also suggests that while
deep learning models can be effective on in-domain data, they generalize poorly
to out-of-domain scenarios, failing to detect novel synthetic samples and
misclassifying unfamiliar bona fide audio. Finally, we observe that adding more
bona fide or fully synthetic utterances to the training data often degrades
performance, whereas adding partially fake utterances improves it.

*Terry Yi Zhong,Cristian Tejedor-Garcia,Martha Larson,Bastiaan R. Bloem*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: RECA-PD是一种新型、鲁棒且可解释的交叉注意力架构，用于基于语音的帕金森病检测，结合可解释的语音特征与自监督表示，性能与现有技术相当，同时提供更一致且临床有意义的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 帕金森病（PD）影响全球超过1000万人，语音障碍常早于运动症状数年出现，因此语音成为早期、非侵入性检测的重要方式。现有深度学习模型虽准确率高，但缺乏临床所需的可解释性。

Method: 提出RECA-PD架构，结合可解释的语音特征与自监督表示，并通过分段长录音缓解某些语音任务（如独白）的性能下降。

Result: RECA-PD在语音检测PD方面性能与现有技术相当，同时提供更一致且临床有意义的解释，表明性能与可解释性并非互斥。

Conclusion: 未来工作将提升非专业人士对解释的可用性，并探索严重性估计以增强临床实际应用价值。

Abstract: Parkinson's Disease (PD) affects over 10 million people globally, with speech
impairments often preceding motor symptoms by years, making speech a valuable
modality for early, non-invasive detection. While recent deep-learning models
achieve high accuracy, they typically lack the explainability required for
clinical use. To address this, we propose RECA-PD, a novel, robust, and
explainable cross-attention architecture that combines interpretable speech
features with self-supervised representations. RECA-PD matches state-of-the-art
performance in Speech-based PD detection while providing explanations that are
more consistent and more clinically meaningful. Additionally, we demonstrate
that performance degradation in certain speech tasks (e.g., monologue) can be
mitigated by segmenting long recordings. Our findings indicate that performance
and explainability are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Future work will
enhance the usability of explanations for non-experts and explore severity
estimation to increase the real-world clinical relevance.

Conclusion: MusGO框架有助于明确音乐生成AI的开放性，推动其透明和负责任的发展。

Abstract: Since 2023, generative AI has rapidly advanced in the music domain. Despite
significant technological advancements, music-generative models raise critical
ethical challenges, including a lack of transparency and accountability, along
with risks such as the replication of artists' works, which highlights the
importance of fostering openness. With upcoming regulations such as the EU AI
Act encouraging open models, many generative models are being released labelled
as 'open'. However, the definition of an open model remains widely debated. In
this article, we adapt a recently proposed evidence-based framework for
assessing openness in LLMs to the music domain. Using feedback from a survey of
110 participants from the Music Information Retrieval (MIR) community, we
refine the framework into MusGO (Music-Generative Open AI), which comprises 13
openness categories: 8 essential and 5 desirable. We evaluate 16
state-of-the-art generative models and provide an openness leaderboard that is
fully open to public scrutiny and community contributions. Through this work,
we aim to clarify the concept of openness in music-generative AI and promote
its transparent and responsible development.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: CLEP-DG通过改进CLAP模型，结合文本驱动的增强策略和跨模态迁移能力，显著提升了语音情感识别的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音情感识别模型在多样化声学条件下泛化能力不足，CLAP模型虽有多模态对齐能力，但缺乏专门的情感线索捕捉机制。

Method: 1. 微调CLAP得到CLEP；2. 引入文本驱动的声学上下文提示调优（ACPT）；3. 利用跨模态迁移能力训练分类器。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上，CLEP-DG优于现有CLAP方法，在监督和领域泛化设置中均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: CLEP-DG通过结合微调、文本增强和跨模态迁移，显著提升了语音情感识别的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is fundamental to affective computing and
human-computer interaction, yet existing models struggle to generalize across
diverse acoustic conditions. While Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining
(CLAP) provides strong multimodal alignment, it lacks dedicated mechanisms for
capturing emotional cues, making it suboptimal for SER. To address this, we
propose CLEP-DG, a framework that enhances CLAP's robustness in emotion
recognition. First, we fine-tune CLAP to obtain CLEP, adapting it on
large-scale emotional speech datasets to better encode emotion-relevant
features. Then, we introduce Acoustic Context Prompt Tuning (ACPT), a
text-driven augmentation strategy that optimizes learnable prompt vectors to
model diverse acoustic environments without additional labeled audio. Finally,
leveraging cross-modal transferability, we train a classifier on text-derived
embeddings and apply it to the audio encoder during inference, mitigating
domain shifts between textual supervision and audio-based emotion recognition.
Experiments across five benchmark datasets show that CLEP-DG outperforms prior
CLAP-based approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both
supervised and domain generalization settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统二分类方法无法捕捉踏板深度的连续变化，限制了其在真实钢琴演奏中的应用。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用Transformer架构进行连续踏板深度估计，并通过合成数据集研究房间声学的影响，采用“留一法”测试模型。

Result: 模型在连续深度估计上表现优异，但对未见过的房间声学条件不鲁棒，混响会引入预测偏差。

Conclusion: 连续深度估计更具音乐表现力，但需进一步研究以提高模型对声学变化的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Piano sustain pedal detection has previously been approached as a binary
on/off classification task, limiting its application in real-world piano
performance scenarios where pedal depth significantly influences musical
expression. This paper presents a novel approach for high-resolution estimation
that predicts continuous pedal depth values. We introduce a Transformer-based
architecture that not only matches state-of-the-art performance on the
traditional binary classification task but also achieves high accuracy in
continuous pedal depth estimation. Furthermore, by estimating continuous
values, our model provides musically meaningful predictions for sustain pedal
usage, whereas baseline models struggle to capture such nuanced expressions
with their binary detection approach. Additionally, this paper investigates the
influence of room acoustics on sustain pedal estimation using a synthetic
dataset that includes varied acoustic conditions. We train our model with
different combinations of room settings and test it in an unseen new
environment using a "leave-one-out" approach. Our findings show that the two
baseline models and ours are not robust to unseen room conditions. Statistical
analysis further confirms that reverberation influences model predictions and
introduces an overestimation bias.

Motivation: 现有TTS方法通常仅支持话语级情感控制，且需全模型微调，可能影响性能。

Method: 采用ControlNet思路，冻结原TTS模型并引入可训练副本处理额外条件，提供情感控制架构设计、流步骤和灵活控制尺度。

Result: 实验表明，TTS-CtrlNet能有效为现有TTS添加情感控制器，在情感相似度指标（Emo-SIM和Aro-Val SIM）上达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: TTS-CtrlNet实现了直观、可扩展的时变情感控制，同时继承原模型能力，为情感TTS提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-speech (TTS) have enabled natural speech
synthesis, but fine-grained, time-varying emotion control remains challenging.
Existing methods often allow only utterance-level control and require full
model fine-tuning with a large emotion speech dataset, which can degrade
performance. Inspired by adding conditional control to the existing model in
ControlNet (Zhang et al, 2023), we propose the first ControlNet-based approach
for controllable flow-matching TTS (TTS-CtrlNet), which freezes the original
model and introduces a trainable copy of it to process additional conditions.
We show that TTS-CtrlNet can boost the pretrained large TTS model by adding
intuitive, scalable, and time-varying emotion control while inheriting the
ability of the original model (e.g., zero-shot voice cloning & naturalness).
Furthermore, we provide practical recipes for adding emotion control: 1)
optimal architecture design choice with block analysis, 2) emotion-specific
flow step, and 3) flexible control scale.
  Experiments show that ours can effectively add an emotion controller to
existing TTS, and achieves state-of-the-art performance with emotion similarity
scores: Emo-SIM and Aro-Val SIM. The project page is available at:

convert the noisy broadcast dataset into a qualitative dataset for
pre-training, by using Whisper and WhisperX., Thirdly, we compare mono-lingual

Conclusion: 该方法有效捕捉了语音情感的内在层次结构，兼容多种TTS系统，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: We investigate hierarchical emotion distribution (ED) for achieving
multi-level quantitative control of emotion rendering in text-to-speech
synthesis (TTS). We introduce a novel multi-step hierarchical ED prediction
module that quantifies emotion variance at the utterance, word, and phoneme
levels. By predicting emotion variance in a multi-step manner, we leverage
global emotional context to refine local emotional variations, thereby
capturing the intrinsic hierarchical structure of speech emotion. Our approach
is validated through its integration into a variance adaptor and an external
module design compatible with various TTS systems. Both objective and
subjective evaluations demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly
enhances emotional expressiveness and enables precise control of emotion
rendering across multiple speech granularities.

Conclusion: 提出的预训练目标显著提升了模型在符号音乐理解任务中的表现。

Abstract: We propose a pre-trained BERT-like model for symbolic music understanding
that achieves competitive performance across a wide range of downstream tasks.
To achieve this target, we design two novel pre-training objectives, namely
token correction and pianoroll prediction. First, we sample a portion of note
tokens and corrupt them with a limited amount of noise, and then train the
model to denoise the corrupted tokens; second, we also train the model to
predict bar-level and local pianoroll-derived representations from the
corrupted note tokens. We argue that these objectives guide the model to better
learn specific musical knowledge such as pitch intervals. For evaluation, we
propose a benchmark that incorporates 12 downstream tasks ranging from chord
estimation to symbolic genre classification. Results confirm the effectiveness
of the proposed pre-training objectives on downstream tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法为语音转换提供了直观且灵活的控制手段，同时保持了高质量的语音输出。

Abstract: Precise control over speech characteristics, such as pitch, duration, and
speech rate, remains a significant challenge in the field of voice conversion.
The ability to manipulate parameters like pitch and syllable rate is an
important element for effective identity conversion, but can also be used
independently for voice transformation, achieving goals that were historically
addressed by vocoder-based methods.
  In this work, we explore a convolutional neural network-based approach that
aims to provide means for modifying fundamental frequency (F0), phoneme
sequences, intensity, and speaker identity. Rather than relying on
disentanglement techniques, our model is explicitly conditioned on these
factors to generate mel spectrograms, which are then converted into waveforms
using a universal neural vocoder. Accordingly, during inference, F0 contours,
phoneme sequences, and speaker embeddings can be freely adjusted, allowing for
intuitively controlled voice transformations.
  We evaluate our approach on speaker conversion and expressive speech tasks
using both perceptual and objective metrics. The results suggest that the
proposed method offers substantial flexibility, while maintaining high
intelligibility and speaker similarity.

Conclusion: 该方法为音乐信息检索提供了更高效的工具，适用于非西方音乐背景，并强调了乐器特定适应策略的重要性。

Abstract: We explore transfer learning strategies for musical onset detection in the
Afro-Brazilian Maracatu tradition, which features complex rhythmic patterns
that challenge conventional models. We adapt two Temporal Convolutional Network
architectures: one pre-trained for onset detection (intra-task) and another for
beat tracking (inter-task). Using only 5-second annotated snippets per
instrument, we fine-tune these models through layer-wise retraining strategies
for five traditional percussion instruments. Our results demonstrate
significant improvements over baseline performance, with F1 scores reaching up
to 0.998 in the intra-task setting and improvements of over 50 percentage
points in best-case scenarios. The cross-task adaptation proves particularly
effective for time-keeping instruments, where onsets naturally align with beat
positions. The optimal fine-tuning configuration varies by instrument,
highlighting the importance of instrument-specific adaptation strategies. This
approach addresses the challenges of underrepresented musical traditions,
offering an efficient human-in-the-loop methodology that minimizes annotation
effort while maximizing performance. Our findings contribute to more inclusive
music information retrieval tools applicable beyond Western musical contexts.

Conclusion: Boomerang采样在音频领域有潜力，可用于数据增强和内容编辑，未来可进一步探索其他应用。

Abstract: Generative models of music audio are typically used to generate output based
solely on a text prompt or melody. Boomerang sampling, recently proposed for
the image domain, allows generating output close to an existing example, using
any pretrained diffusion model. In this work, we explore its application in the
audio domain as a tool for data augmentation or content manipulation.
Specifically, implementing Boomerang sampling for Stable Audio Open, we augment
training data for a state-of-the-art beat tracker, and attempt to replace
musical instruments in recordings. Our results show that the rhythmic structure
of existing examples is mostly preserved, that it improves performance of the
beat tracker, but only in scenarios of limited training data, and that it can
accomplish text-based instrument replacement on monophonic inputs. We publish
our implementation to invite experiments on data augmentation in other tasks
and explore further applications.

Abstract: We propose Expotion (Facial Expression and Motion Control for Multimodal

specifically, human facial expressions and upper-body motion - as well as text
prompts to produce expressive and temporally accurate music. We adopt
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) on the pretrained text-to-music
generation model, enabling fine-grained adaptation to the multimodal controls
using a small dataset. To ensure precise synchronization between video and
music, we introduce a temporal smoothing strategy to align multiple modalities.
Experiments demonstrate that integrating visual features alongside textual
descriptions enhances the overall quality of generated music in terms of
musicality, creativity, beat-tempo consistency, temporal alignment with the
video, and text adherence, surpassing both proposed baselines and existing
state-of-the-art video-to-music generation models. Additionally, we introduce a

expressive facial and upper-body gestures aligned with corresponding music,
providing significant potential for future research in multimodal and

Abstract: In learning music, difficulty is an important factor in choice of repertoire,
choice of tempo, and structure of practice. These choices are typically done
with the guidance of a teacher; however, not all learners have access to one.
While piano and strings have had some attention devoted to automated difficulty
estimation, wind instruments have so far been under-served. In this paper, we
propose a method for estimating the difficulty of pieces for winds and
implement it for the tenor saxophone. We take the cost-of-traversal approach,
modelling the part as a sequence of transitions -- note pairs. We estimate
transition costs from newly collected recordings of trill speeds, comparing
representations of saxophone fingerings at various levels of expert input. We
then compute and visualise the cost of the optimal path through the part, at a
given tempo. While we present this model for the tenor saxophone, the same
pipeline can be applied to other woodwinds, and our experiments show that with
appropriate feature design, only a small proportion of possible trills is
needed to estimate the costs well. Thus, we present a practical way of
diversifying the capabilities of MIR in music education to the wind family of
instruments.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: LAPS-Diff是一种结合语言感知嵌入和声乐风格引导学习的扩散模型，针对宝莱坞印地语歌唱风格设计，显著提升了低资源场景下的歌唱语音合成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散模型在歌唱语音合成中难以捕捉声乐风格、特定流派的音高变化和语言依赖特征，尤其是在低资源场景下。

Method: 提出LAPS-Diff，整合语言感知嵌入和风格编码器，利用预训练语言模型提取歌词表征，并结合音高提取模型和音乐嵌入优化声学特征生成。

Result: 通过主客观评估，LAPS-Diff在低资源数据集上的表现显著优于现有最优模型。

Conclusion: LAPS-Diff在低资源场景下有效提升了歌唱语音合成的自然度和表现力。

Abstract: The field of Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) has seen significant advancements
in recent years due to the rapid progress of diffusion-based approaches.
However, capturing vocal style, genre-specific pitch inflections, and
language-dependent characteristics remains challenging, particularly in
low-resource scenarios. To address this, we propose LAPS-Diff, a diffusion
model integrated with language-aware embeddings and a vocal-style guided
learning mechanism, specifically designed for Bollywood Hindi singing style. We
curate a Hindi SVS dataset and leverage pre-trained language models to extract
word and phone-level embeddings for an enriched lyrics representation.
Additionally, we incorporated a style encoder and a pitch extraction model to
compute style and pitch losses, capturing features essential to the naturalness
and expressiveness of the synthesized singing, particularly in terms of vocal
style and pitch variations. Furthermore, we utilize MERT and IndicWav2Vec
models to extract musical and contextual embeddings, serving as conditional
priors to refine the acoustic feature generation process further. Based on
objective and subjective evaluations, we demonstrate that LAPS-Diff
significantly improves the quality of the generated samples compared to the
considered state-of-the-art (SOTA) model for our constrained dataset that is
typical of the low resource scenario.

Motivation: 传统动态选择策略设计复杂且依赖专业知识，LLM-SAEA旨在通过LLM简化这一过程。

Result: 实验表明LLM-SAEA优于现有先进算法。

Conclusion: LLM-SAEA为代理辅助进化算法提供了一种高效且自动化的配置方法。

Abstract: Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) are a key tool for
addressing costly optimization tasks, with their efficiency being heavily
dependent on the selection of surrogate models and infill sampling criteria.
However, designing an effective dynamic selection strategy for SAEAs is
labor-intensive and requires substantial domain knowledge. To address this
challenge, this paper proposes LLM-SAEA, a novel approach that integrates large
language models (LLMs) to configure both surrogate models and infill sampling
criteria online. Specifically, LLM-SAEA develops a collaboration-of-experts
framework, where one LLM serves as a scoring expert (LLM-SE), assigning scores
to surrogate models and infill sampling criteria based on their optimization
performance, while another LLM acts as a decision expert (LLM-DE), selecting
the appropriate configurations by analyzing their scores along with the current
optimization state. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-SAEA outperforms
several state-of-the-art algorithms across standard test cases. The source code

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SESLR的新型在线持续学习方法，通过结合睡眠增强的潜在重放方案和脉冲神经网络（SNNs），显著降低了内存开销并缓解了对新任务的分类偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘计算场景需要硬件高效的在线持续学习算法以适应动态环境，但现有算法存在高内存开销和对新任务的偏差问题。

Method: SESLR利用SNNs的二进制脉冲特性将重放特征存储为单比特，并通过噪声增强的睡眠阶段训练模型以缓解偏差。

Result: 在Split CIFAR10上，SESLR的平均准确率提高了近30%，内存消耗仅为基线方法的三分之一；在Split CIFAR10-DVS上，准确率提高约10%，内存开销减少32倍。

Conclusion: SESLR是一种适用于资源受限边缘计算场景的高效在线持续学习解决方案。

Abstract: Edge computing scenarios necessitate the development of hardware-efficient
online continual learning algorithms to be adaptive to dynamic environment.
However, existing algorithms always suffer from high memory overhead and bias
towards recently trained tasks. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a
novel online continual learning approach termed as SESLR, which incorporates a
sleep enhanced latent replay scheme with spiking neural networks (SNNs). SESLR
leverages SNNs' binary spike characteristics to store replay features in single
bits, significantly reducing memory overhead. Furthermore, inspired by
biological sleep-wake cycles, SESLR introduces a noise-enhanced sleep phase
where the model exclusively trains on replay samples with controlled noise
injection, effectively mitigating classification bias towards new classes.
Extensive experiments on both conventional (MNIST, CIFAR10) and neuromorphic
(NMNIST, CIFAR10-DVS) datasets demonstrate SESLR's effectiveness. On Split
CIFAR10, SESLR achieves nearly 30% improvement in average accuracy with only
one-third of the memory consumption compared to baseline methods. On Split
CIFAR10-DVS, it improves accuracy by approximately 10% while reducing memory
overhead by a factor of 32. These results validate SESLR as a promising
solution for online continual learning in resource-constrained edge computing
scenarios.

Abstract: This paper explores the possibility of determining the weights and thresholds
of a neural network using the potential -- a parameter of an electrostatic
field -- without analytical calculations and without applying training
algorithms. The work is based on neural network architectures employing metric
recognition methods. The electrostatic field is simulated in the Builder C++
environment. In the same environment, a neural network based on metric
recognition methods is constructed, with the weights of the first-layer neurons
determined by the values of the potentials of the simulated electrostatic
field. The effectiveness of the resulting neural network within the simulated
system is evaluated using the MNIST test dataset under various initial
conditions of the simulated system. The results demonstrated functional
viability. The implementation of this approach shows that a neural network can
obtain weight values almost instantaneously from the electrostatic field,
without the need for analytical computations, lengthy training procedures, or

Motivation: 解决现有搜索方法无法直接使用SynOps作为约束的问题，以促进SNN在边缘设备上的部署。

Method: 提出SPEAR框架，结合SynOps预测机制LRE和奖励机制TAR，利用强化学习进行网络剪枝。

Result: 实验表明SPEAR能有效压缩SNN，满足特定SynOps约束。

Conclusion: SPEAR为SNN在资源受限硬件上的部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: While deep spiking neural networks (SNNs) demonstrate superior performance,
their deployment on resource-constrained neuromorphic hardware still remains
challenging. Network pruning offers a viable solution by reducing both
parameters and synaptic operations (SynOps) to facilitate the edge deployment
of SNNs, among which search-based pruning methods search for the SNNs structure
after pruning. However, existing search-based methods fail to directly use
SynOps as the constraint because it will dynamically change in the searching
process, resulting in the final searched network violating the expected SynOps
target. In this paper, we introduce a novel SNN pruning framework called SPEAR,
which leverages reinforcement learning (RL) technique to directly use SynOps as
the searching constraint. To avoid the violation of SynOps requirements, we
first propose a SynOps prediction mechanism called LRE to accurately predict
the final SynOps after search. Observing SynOps cannot be explicitly calculated
and added to constrain the action in RL, we propose a novel reward called TAR
to stabilize the searching. Extensive experiments show that our SPEAR framework
can effectively compress SNN under specific SynOps constraint.

Result: HDRP-SNN显著减少冗余脉冲，在静态和神经形态数据集上达到SOTA准确率，噪声抵抗力优于传统SNN和ANN。

Conclusion: HDRP机制对提升低延迟SNN性能至关重要，同时保持了SNN的二进制特性。

Abstract: The refractory period controls neuron spike firing rate, crucial for network
stability and noise resistance. With advancements in spiking neural network
(SNN) training methods, low-latency SNN applications have expanded. In
low-latency SNNs, shorter simulation steps render traditional refractory
mechanisms, which rely on empirical distributions or spike firing rates, less
effective. However, omitting the refractory period amplifies the risk of neuron
over-activation and reduces the system's robustness to noise. To address this
challenge, we propose a historical dynamic refractory period (HDRP) model that
leverages membrane potential derivative with historical refractory periods to
estimate an initial refractory period and dynamically adjust its duration.
Additionally, we propose a threshold-dependent refractory kernel to mitigate
excessive neuron state accumulation. Our approach retains the binary
characteristics of SNNs while enhancing both noise resistance and overall
performance. Experimental results show that HDRP-SNN significantly reduces
redundant spikes compared to traditional SNNs, and achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) accuracy both on static datasets and neuromorphic datasets. Moreover,
HDRP-SNN outperforms artificial neural networks (ANNs) and traditional SNNs in
noise resistance, highlighting the crucial role of the HDRP mechanism in
enhancing the performance of low-latency SNNs.

Abstract: We investigate the behaviour space of meta-heuristic optimisation algorithms
automatically generated by Large Language Model driven algorithm discovery
methods. Using the Large Language Evolutionary Algorithm (LLaMEA) framework
with a GPT o4-mini LLM, we iteratively evolve black-box optimisation
heuristics, evaluated on 10 functions from the BBOB benchmark suite. Six LLaMEA
variants, featuring different mutation prompt strategies, are compared and
analysed. We log dynamic behavioural metrics including exploration,
exploitation, convergence and stagnation measures, for each run, and analyse
these via visual projections and network-based representations. Our analysis
combines behaviour-based
  projections, Code Evolution Graphs built from static code features,
performance convergence curves, and behaviour-based Search Trajectory Networks.
The results reveal clear differences in search dynamics and algorithm
structures across LLaMEA configurations. Notably, the variant that employs both
a code simplification prompt and a random perturbation prompt in a 1+1 elitist
evolution strategy, achieved the best performance, with the highest Area Over
the Convergence Curve. Behaviour-space visualisations show that
higher-performing algorithms exhibit more intensive exploitation behaviour and
faster convergence with less stagnation. Our findings demonstrate how
behaviour-space analysis can explain why certain LLM-designed heuristics
outperform others and how LLM-driven algorithm discovery navigates the
open-ended and complex search space of algorithms. These findings provide
insights to guide the future design of adaptive LLM-driven algorithm
generators.

Result: PAES-25在$m$-LOTZ问题上表现出色，特别是在$m\geq4$时优于(G)SEMO，运行时界限为$\Theta(n^3)$（$m=2$）至$\Theta(n(2n/m)^{m/2}\log(n/m))$（$m>4$）。

Conclusion: PAES-25在多目标优化问题中具有高效性，但存在对某些基准问题的局限性。

Abstract: This paper presents a first mathematical runtime analysis of PAES-25, an
enhanced version of the original Pareto Archived Evolution Strategy (PAES)
coming from the study of telecommunication problems over two decades ago to
understand the dynamics of local search of MOEAs on many-objective fitness
landscapes. We derive tight expected runtime bounds of PAES-25 with one-bit
mutation on $m$-LOTZ until the entire Pareto front is found: $\Theta(n^3)$
iterations if $m=2$, $\Theta(n^3 \log^2(n))$ iterations if $m=4$ and
$\Theta(n(2n/m)^{m/2} \log(n/m))$ iterations if $m>4$ where $n$ is the problem
size and $m$ the number of objectives. To the best of our knowledge, these are
the first known tight runtime bounds for an MOEA outperforming the best known
upper bound of $O(n^{m+1})$ for (G)SEMO on $m$-LOTZ when $m$ is at least $4$.
We also show that archivers, such as the Adaptive Grid Archiver (AGA),
Hypervolume Archiver (HVA) or Multi-Level Grid Archiver (MGA), help to
distribute the set of solutions across the Pareto front of $m$-LOTZ
efficiently. We also show that PAES-25 with standard bit mutation optimizes the
bi-objective LOTZ benchmark in expected $O(n^4)$ iterations, and we discuss its
limitations on other benchmarks such as OMM or COCZ.

Result: 单目标版本在平均超体积上表现更好，多目标版本需进一步优化。

Conclusion: 在某些情况下，单目标方法更优，同时提出了改进多目标模块化GP-GOMEA的方向。

Abstract: In Symbolic Regression (SR), achieving a proper balance between accuracy and
interpretability remains a key challenge. The Genetic Programming variant of
the Gene-pool Optimal Mixing Evolutionary Algorithm (GP-GOMEA) is of particular
interest as it achieves state-of-the-art performance using a template that
limits the size of expressions. A recently introduced expansion, modular
GP-GOMEA, is capable of decomposing expressions using multiple subexpressions,
further increasing chances of interpretability. However, modular GP-GOMEA may
create larger expressions, increasing the need to balance size and accuracy. A
multi-objective variant of GP-GOMEA exists, which can be used, for instance, to
optimize for size and accuracy simultaneously, discovering their trade-off.
However, even with enhancements that we propose in this paper to improve the
performance of multi-objective modular GP-GOMEA, when optimizing for size and
accuracy, the single-objective version in which a multi-objective archive is
used only for logging, still consistently finds a better average hypervolume.
We consequently analyze when a single-objective approach should be preferred.
Additionally, we explore an objective that stimulates re-use in multi-objective
modular GP-GOMEA.

Conclusion: NSGA-III-UR是一种高效且适应性强的算法，适用于多样化的优化问题。

Abstract: The NSGA-III algorithm relies on uniformly distributed reference points to
promote diversity in many-objective optimization problems. However, this
strategy may underperform when facing irregular Pareto fronts, where certain
vectors remain unassociated with any optimal solutions. While adaptive schemes
such as A-NSGA-III address this issue by dynamically modifying reference
points, they may introduce unnecessary complexity in regular scenarios. This
paper proposes NSGA-III with Update when Required (NSGA-III-UR), a hybrid
algorithm that selectively activates reference vector adaptation based on the
estimated regularity of the Pareto front. Experimental results on benchmark
suites (DTLZ1-7, IDTLZ1-2) and real-world problems demonstrate that NSGA-III-UR
consistently outperforms NSGA-III and A-NSGA-III across diverse problem
landscapes.

Conclusion: 自适应酉递归为符号和连续序列建模提供了强大且高效的归纳偏置。

Abstract: Recent work has revealed that state space models (SSMs), while efficient for
long-sequence processing, are fundamentally limited in their ability to
represent formal languages particularly due to time-invariant and real-valued
recurrence structures. In this work, we draw inspiration from adaptive and
structured dynamics observed in biological neural systems and introduce the
Adaptive Unitary State Space Model (AUSSM)- a novel class of SSMs that
leverages skew-symmetric, input-dependent recurrence to achieve unitary
evolution and high expressive power. Using algebraic automata theory, we prove
that AUSSM can perform modulo counting and simulate solvable group automata at
finite precision, enabling SSMs to model a broad class of regular languages
that are out of reach for other SSM architectures. To overcome the practical
inefficiencies of adaptive recurrence, we develop a separable convolution
formulation and a CUDA implementation that enables scalable parallel training.
Empirically, we show that AUSSM when interleaved with Mamba outperform prior
SSMs on formal algorithmic tasks such as parity and modular arithmetic, and
achieve competent performance on real-world long time-series classification
benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that adaptive unitary recurrence provides a
powerful and efficient inductive bias for both symbolic and continuous sequence
modeling.

Conclusion: 研究填补了深度学习工具与安全关键自主系统鲁棒性需求之间的重要差距。

Abstract: Deep neural policies have unlocked agile flight for quadcopters, adaptive
grasping for manipulators, and reliable navigation for ground robots, yet their
millions of weights conflict with the tight memory and real-time constraints of
embedded microcontrollers. Second-order pruning methods, such as Optimal Brain
Damage (OBD) and its variants, including Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) and the
recent SparseGPT, compress networks in a single pass by leveraging the local
Hessian, achieving far higher sparsity than magnitude thresholding. Despite
their success in vision and language, the consequences of such weight removal
on closed-loop stability, tracking accuracy, and safety have remained unclear.
We present the first mathematically rigorous robustness analysis of
second-order pruning in nonlinear discrete-time control. The system evolves
under a continuous transition map, while the controller is an $L$-layer
multilayer perceptron with ReLU-type activations that are globally 1-Lipschitz.
Pruning the weight matrix of layer $k$ replaces $W_k$ with $W_k+\delta W_k$,
producing the perturbed parameter vector $\widehat{\Theta}=\Theta+\delta\Theta$
and the pruned policy $\pi(\cdot;\widehat{\Theta})$. For every input state
$s\in X$ we derive the closed-form inequality $
\|\pi(s;\Theta)-\pi(s;\widehat{\Theta})\|_2 \le C_k(s)\,\|\delta W_k\|_2, $
where the constant $C_k(s)$ depends only on unpruned spectral norms and biases,
and can be evaluated in closed form from a single forward pass. The derived
bounds specify, prior to field deployment, the maximal admissible pruning
magnitude compatible with a prescribed control-error threshold. By linking
second-order network compression with closed-loop performance guarantees, our
work narrows a crucial gap between modern deep-learning tooling and the

Abstract: In the field of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), a fundamental challenge is to
facilitate human understanding of robots. The emerging domain of eXplainable
HRI (XHRI) investigates methods to generate explanations and evaluate their
impact on human-robot interactions. Previous works have highlighted the need to
personalise the level of detail of these explanations to enhance usability and
comprehension. Our paper presents a framework designed to update and retrieve
user knowledge-memory models, allowing for adapting the explanations' level of
detail while referencing previously acquired concepts. Three architectures
based on our proposed framework that use Large Language Models (LLMs) are
evaluated in two distinct scenarios: a hospital patrolling robot and a kitchen
assistant robot. Experimental results demonstrate that a two-stage
architecture, which first generates an explanation and then personalises it, is
the framework architecture that effectively reduces the level of detail only
when there is related user knowledge.

Abstract: Large image generation and vision models, combined with differentiable
rendering technologies, have become powerful tools for generating paths that
can be drawn or painted by a robot. However, these tools often overlook the
intrinsic physicality of the human drawing/writing act, which is usually
executed with skillful hand/arm gestures. Taking this into account is important
for the visual aesthetics of the results and for the development of closer and
more intuitive artist-robot collaboration scenarios. We present a method that
bridges this gap by enabling gradient-based optimization of natural human-like
motions guided by cost functions defined in image space. To this end, we use
the sigma-lognormal model of human hand/arm movements, with an adaptation that
enables its use in conjunction with a differentiable vector graphics (DiffVG)
renderer. We demonstrate how this pipeline can be used to generate feasible
trajectories for a robot by combining image-driven objectives with a
minimum-time smoothing criterion. We demonstrate applications with generation
and robotic reproduction of synthetic graffiti as well as image abstraction.

anthropomorphic robotic hand for biomimetic dexterity, and (2) an
optimization--based motion retargeting for real--time, high--fidelity
reproduction of intricate human hand motions and seamless hand--arm
coordination. We validate the system via extensive empirical evaluations,

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了MPC的性能和适应性，成功应用于微型四旋翼飞行器，并开源实现以促进机器人社区发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in Model Predictive Control (MPC) leveraging a combination of
first-order methods, such as the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers
(ADMM), and offline precomputation and caching of select operations, have
excitingly enabled real-time MPC on microcontrollers. Unfortunately, these
approaches require the use of fixed hyperparameters, limiting their
adaptability and overall performance. In this work, we introduce First-Order
Adaptive Caching, which precomputes not only select matrix operations but also
their sensitivities to hyperparameter variations, enabling online
hyperparameter updates without full recomputation of the cache. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach on a number of dynamic quadrotor tasks,
achieving up to a 63.4% reduction in ADMM iterations over the use of optimized
fixed hyperparameters and approaching 70% of the performance of a full cache
recomputation, while reducing the computational cost from O(n^3) to O(n^2)
complexity. This performance enables us to perform figure-eight trajectories on
a 27g tiny quadrotor under wind disturbances. We release our implementation
open-source for the benefit of the wider robotics community.

Abstract: The widespread use of consumer drones has introduced serious challenges for
airspace security and public safety. Their high agility and unpredictable
motion make drones difficult to track and intercept. While existing methods
focus on detecting current positions, many counter-drone strategies rely on
forecasting future trajectories and thus require more than reactive detection
to be effective. To address this critical gap, we propose an unsupervised
vision-based method for predicting the three-dimensional trajectories of
drones. Our approach first uses an unsupervised technique to extract drone
trajectories from raw LiDAR point clouds, then aligns these trajectories with
camera images through motion consistency to generate reliable pseudo-labels. We
then combine kinematic estimation with a visual Mamba neural network in a
self-supervised manner to predict future drone trajectories. We evaluate our
method on the challenging MMAUD dataset, including the V2 sequences that
feature wide-field-of-view multimodal sensors and dynamic UAV motion in urban
scenes. Extensive experiments show that our framework outperforms supervised
image-only and audio-visual baselines in long-horizon trajectory prediction,
reducing 5-second 3D error by around 40 percent without using any manual 3D
labels. The proposed system offers a cost-effective, scalable alternative for
real-time counter-drone deployment. All code will be released upon acceptance
to support reproducible research in the robotics community.

detections while handling synchronization issues. Experiments show that UniKF
outperforms baseline methods across various noise levels, achieving up to 3x
lower object's positioning and orientation errors and 2x lower dimension
estimation errors, while maintaining nearperfect precision and recall between
99.5% and 100%.

Abstract: Removing floating litter from water bodies is crucial to preserving aquatic
ecosystems and preventing environmental pollution. In this work, we present a
multi-robot aerial soft manipulator for floating litter collection, leveraging
the capabilities of aerial robots. The proposed system consists of two aerial
robots connected by a flexible rope manipulator, which collects floating litter
using a hook-based tool. Compared to single-aerial-robot solutions, the use of
two aerial robots increases payload capacity and flight endurance while
reducing the downwash effect at the manipulation point, located at the midpoint
of the rope. Additionally, we employ an optimization-based rope-shape planner
to compute the desired rope shape. The planner incorporates an adaptive
behavior that maximizes grasping capabilities near the litter while minimizing
rope tension when farther away. The computed rope shape trajectory is
controlled by a shape visual servoing controller, which approximates the rope
as a parabola. The complete system is validated in outdoor experiments,
demonstrating successful grasping operations. An ablation study highlights how
the planner's adaptive mechanism improves the success rate of the operation.
Furthermore, real-world tests in a water channel confirm the effectiveness of
our system in floating litter collection. These results demonstrate the
potential of aerial robots for autonomous litter removal in aquatic
environments.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在卫星对接模拟中表现出高效性和可扩展性，适用于近距离操作。

Abstract: Fuel-free docking is a key operational technology for in-space assembly,
resupplying space stations, sample return missions, and formation keeping of
large-scale satellite swarms. The use of conventional propulsion systems,
including thrusters, can cause adverse effects at short distances, such as
sensor contamination, which may lead to the failure of the satellite or onboard
equipment. The magnetic field interaction control generated by magnetorquers
can overcome these weaknesses of propulsion. This actuation enables
simultaneous control of attitude and formation control among desired satellite
groups. The previous study typically uses the traditional dipole approximation
model of the exact magnetic field to reduce computation cost. However,
proximity operations often involve relatively short distances between
satellites, which can easily compromise the effectiveness of this
approximation. To avoid model errors that could result in satellite collisions,
we utilize a magnetic field model described by Biot-Savart's law, without
distance approximations (Near-field model), in consideration of short-distance
operations. To overcome the high computational cost associated with the coil
geometry and relative states information, a learning-based magnetic field
approximation is derived, and its effectiveness is shown in the docking
simulation of target and chaser satellites equipped with electromagnetic coils
on three axes. Our method significantly reduces the computational cost of the
exact magnetic model and possesses scalability that can accommodate an
increasing number of target satellites through parallel processing.

leverages deep neural networks to identify efficient nonlinear embeddings of

Result: 在0.1至1.0毫米间隙的工业相关几何体上，成功率提升6倍至96.7%，并显著降低插入力。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了更安全、高效的装配，适用于复杂几何体的精确装配任务。

Abstract: Robotic assembly of complex, non-convex geometries with tight clearances
remains a challenging problem, demanding precise state estimation for
successful insertion. In this work, we propose a novel framework that relies
solely on contact states to estimate the full SE(3) pose of a peg relative to a
hole. Our method constructs an online submanifold of contact states through
primitive motions with just 6 seconds of online execution, subsequently mapping
it to an offline contact manifold for precise pose estimation. We demonstrate
that without such state estimation, robots risk jamming and excessive force
application, potentially causing damage. We evaluate our approach on five
industrially relevant, complex geometries with 0.1 to 1.0 mm clearances,
achieving a 96.7% success rate - a 6x improvement over primitive-based
insertion without state estimation. Additionally, we analyze insertion forces,
and overall insertion times, showing our method significantly reduces the
average wrench, enabling safer and more efficient assembly.

Abstract: Recent advancements in imitation learning have shown promising results in
robotic manipulation, driven by the availability of high-quality training data.
To improve data collection efficiency, some approaches focus on developing
specialized teleoperation devices for robot control, while others directly use
human hand demonstrations to obtain training data.However, the former requires
both a robotic system and a skilled operator, limiting scalability, while the
latter faces challenges in aligning the visual gap between human hand
demonstrations and the deployed robot observations.To address this, we propose
a human hand data collection system combined with our hand-to-gripper
generative model, which translates human hand demonstrations into robot gripper
demonstrations, effectively bridging the observation gap.Specifically, a GoPro
fisheye camera is mounted on the human wrist to capture human hand
demonstrations.We then train a generative model on a self-collected dataset of
paired human hand and UMI gripper demonstrations, which have been processed
using a tailored data pre-processing strategy to ensure alignment in both
timestamps and observations.Therefore, given only human hand demonstrations, we
are able to automatically extract the corresponding SE(3) actions and integrate
them with high-quality generated robot demonstrations through our generation
pipeline for training robotic policy model.In experiments, the robust
manipulation performance demonstrates not only the quality of the generated
robot demonstrations but also the efficiency and practicality of our data
collection method.More demonstrations can be found at: https://rwor.github.io/

Abstract: Modular robotics holds immense potential for space exploration, where
reliability, repairability, and reusability are critical for cost-effective
missions. Coordination between heterogeneous units is paramount for precision
tasks -- whether in manipulation, legged locomotion, or multi-robot
interaction. Such modular systems introduce challenges far exceeding those in
monolithic robot architectures. This study presents a robust method for
synchronizing the trajectories of multiple heterogeneous actuators, adapting
dynamically to system variations with minimal system knowledge. This design
makes it inherently robot-agnostic, thus highly suited for modularity. To
ensure smooth trajectory adherence, the multidimensional state is constrained
within a hypersphere representing the allowable deviation. The distance metric
can be adapted hence, depending on the task and system under control,
deformation of the constraint region is possible. This approach is compatible
with a wide range of robotic platforms and serves as a core interface for
Motion-Stack, our new open-source universal framework for limb coordination
(available at https://github.com/2lian/Motion-Stack ). The method is validated
by synchronizing the end-effectors of six highly heterogeneous robotic limbs,
evaluating both trajectory adherence and recovery from significant external
disturbances.

Abstract: Learning from Demonstration (LfD) techniques enable robots to learn and
generalize tasks from user demonstrations, eliminating the need for coding
expertise among end-users. One established technique to implement LfD in robots
is to encode demonstrations in a stable Dynamical System (DS). However, finding
a stable dynamical system entails solving an optimization problem with bilinear
matrix inequality (BMI) constraints, a non-convex problem which, depending on
the number of scalar constraints and variables, demands significant
computational resources and is susceptible to numerical issues such as
floating-point errors. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
compositional approach that enhances the applicability and scalability of
learning stable DSs with BMIs.

Abstract: This paper proposes an innovative LiDAR-Inertial-Camera SLAM system with 3D
Gaussian Splatting, which is the first to jointly consider visual quality,
geometric accuracy, and real-time performance. It robustly and accurately
estimates poses while building a photo-realistic 3D Gaussian map in real time
that enables high-quality novel view RGB and depth rendering. To effectively
address under-reconstruction in regions not covered by the LiDAR, we employ a
lightweight zero-shot depth model that synergistically combines RGB appearance
cues with sparse LiDAR measurements to generate dense depth maps. The depth
completion enables reliable Gaussian initialization in LiDAR-blind areas,
significantly improving system applicability for sparse LiDAR sensors. To
enhance geometric accuracy, we use sparse but precise LiDAR depths to supervise
Gaussian map optimization and accelerate it with carefully designed
CUDA-accelerated strategies. Furthermore, we explore how the incrementally
reconstructed Gaussian map can improve the robustness of odometry. By tightly
incorporating photometric constraints from the Gaussian map into the
continuous-time factor graph optimization, we demonstrate improved pose
estimation under LiDAR degradation scenarios. We also showcase downstream
applications via extending our elaborate system, including video frame
interpolation and fast 3D mesh extraction. To support rigorous evaluation, we
construct a dedicated LiDAR-Inertial-Camera dataset featuring ground-truth
poses, depth maps, and extrapolated trajectories for assessing out-of-sequence
novel view synthesis. Extensive experiments on both public and self-collected
datasets demonstrate the superiority and versatility of our system across LiDAR
sensors with varying sampling densities. Both the dataset and code will be made
publicly available on project page https://xingxingzuo.github.io/gaussian_lic2.

Conclusion: ROLT在未知条件下表现出色，无需复杂训练或适应技术。

Abstract: To succeed in the real world, robots must deal with situations that differ
from those seen during training. Those out-of-distribution situations for
legged robot mainly include challenging dynamic gaps and perceptual gaps. Here
we study the problem of robust locomotion in such novel situations. While
previous methods usually rely on designing elaborate training and adaptation
techniques, we approach the problem from a network model perspective. Our
approach, RObust Locomotion Transformer(ROLT),a variation of transformer,could
achieve robustness in a variety of unseen conditions. ROLT introduces two key
designs: body tokenization and consistent dropout. Body tokenization supports
knowledge share across different limbs, which boosts generalization ability of
the network. Meanwhile, a novel dropout strategy enhances the policy's
robustness to unseen perceptual noise. We conduct extensive experiments both on
quadruped and hexapod robots. Results demonstrate that ROLT is more robust than
existing methods. Although trained in only a few dynamic settings, the learned
policy generalizes well to multiple unseen dynamic conditions. Additionally,
despite training with clean observations, the model handles challenging
corruption noise during testing.

compared to traditional navigation methods directly, which is a problem for
their ultimate acceptance in general navigation contexts. In this work, we
explore the viability of imitation learning (IL) for indoor navigation, using
expert (joystick) demonstrations to train various navigation policy networks
based on RGB images, LiDAR, and a combination of both, and we compare our IL
approach to a traditional potential field-based navigation method. We evaluate
the approach on a physical mobile robot platform equipped with a 2D LiDAR and a
camera in an indoor university environment. Our multimodal model demonstrates
superior navigation capabilities in most scenarios, but faces challenges in
dynamic environments, likely due to limited diversity in the demonstrations.
Nevertheless, the ability to learn directly from data and generalise across
layouts suggests that IL can be a practical navigation approach, and
potentially a useful initialisation strategy for subsequent lifelong learning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于多智能体强化学习的框架，通过模拟人类手臂摆动来优化人形机器人的全身控制和平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类行走时手臂自然摆动以调节全身动力学和保持平衡的启发，研究旨在通过多智能体强化学习实现人形机器人的协调控制。

Method: 采用分散式执行-集中式训练的多智能体强化学习框架，手臂和腿部分别由独立的Actor-Critic结构控制，共享基础状态和角动量观测，并通过模块化奖励设计优化任务相关行为。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在单智能体和多智能体基线对比中表现更优，成功应用于多种复杂运动任务，如平地行走、崎岖地形和爬楼梯。

Conclusion: 该框架通过手臂运动的协调控制显著提升了人形机器人的平衡能力和运动鲁棒性。

Abstract: Humans naturally swing their arms during locomotion to regulate whole-body
dynamics, reduce angular momentum, and help maintain balance. Inspired by this
principle, we present a limb-level multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL)
framework that enables coordinated whole-body control of humanoid robots
through emergent arm motion. Our approach employs separate actor-critic
structures for the arms and legs, trained with centralized critics but
decentralized actors that share only base states and centroidal angular
momentum (CAM) observations, allowing each agent to specialize in task-relevant
behaviors through modular reward design. The arm agent guided by CAM tracking
and damping rewards promotes arm motions that reduce overall angular momentum
and vertical ground reaction moments, contributing to improved balance during
locomotion or under external perturbations. Comparative studies with
single-agent and alternative multi-agent baselines further validate the
effectiveness of our approach. Finally, we deploy the learned policy on a
humanoid platform, achieving robust performance across diverse locomotion
tasks, including flat-ground walking, rough terrain traversal, and stair
climbing.

Motivation: 探索沉浸式VR在农业机器人控制中的应用，以提高病害检测与治疗的效率和精确性。

Method: 通过Unity-ROS模拟比较人类操作员、沉浸式VR控制机器人和非沉浸式VR控制机器人在扫描和治疗任务中的表现。

Result: 沉浸式VR机器人在治疗任务中效率提升65%，导航任务中比人类快38%，但在手动扫描任务中表现较慢。

Conclusion: 沉浸式VR在精准农业中具有提升效率和精确性的潜力，但需注意模拟逼真度和通用性的限制。

Abstract: This study explores the use of immersive virtual reality (VR) as a control
interface for agricultural robots in vineyard disease detection and treatment.
Using a Unity-ROS simulation, it compares three agents: a human operator, an
immersive VR-controlled robot, and a non-immersive VR-controlled robot. During
the scanning phase, humans perform best due to agility and control speed.
However, in the treatment phase, immersive VR robots outperform others,
completing tasks up to 65% faster by using stored infection data and optimized
path planning. In yield-map-based navigation, immersive robots are also 38%
faster than humans. Despite slower performance in manual scanning tasks,
immersive VR excels in memory-guided, repetitive operations. The study
highlights the role of interface design and path optimization, noting
limitations in simulation fidelity and generalizability. It concludes that
immersive VR has strong potential to enhance efficiency and precision in
precision agriculture.

*Abhijeet Behera,Sogol Kharrazi,Erik Frisk,Maytheewat Aramrattana*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了三种改进的TTC$_{\text{2D}}$方法，以解决原方法在车辆航向、铰接车辆和速度变化方面的局限性，并在CARLA仿真环境中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原TTC$_{\text{2D}}$方法假设车辆航向相同且不变，且未考虑铰接车辆和速度变化，限制了其在实际场景中的应用。

Method: 提出了三种改进方法：1) 加入车辆航向信息；2) 适应铰接车辆；3) 允许恒定加速度。在CARLA仿真环境中测试。

Result: 改进方法不仅能检测追尾碰撞（类似TTC），还能识别侧面碰撞风险（TTC无法预测）。

Conclusion: 改进的TTC$_{\text{2D}}$方法扩展了原方法的适用性，能更全面地评估碰撞风险。

Abstract: Time-to-collision (TTC) is a widely used measure for estimating the time
until a rear-end collision between two vehicles, assuming both maintain
constant speeds and headings in the prediction horizon. To also capture
sideswipe collisions, a two-dimensional extension, TTC$_{\text{2D}}$, was
introduced. However, this formulation assumes both vehicles have the same
heading and that their headings remain unchanged during the manoeuvre, in
addition to the standard assumptions on the prediction horizon. Moreover, its
use for articulated vehicles like a tractor-semitrailer remains unclear. This
paper addresses these limitations by developing three enhanced versions of
TTC$_{\text{2D}}$. The first incorporates vehicle heading information, which is
missing in the original formulation. The standard assumption of constant speed
and heading in the prediction horizon holds. The second adapts this to
articulated vehicles while retaining the assumptions of the first version. The
third version maintains the constant heading assumption but relaxes the
constant speed assumption by allowing constant acceleration. The versions are
tested in a cut-in scenario using the CARLA simulation environment. They detect
rear-end collisions, similar to TTC, and moreover, they also identify sideswipe
risks, something TTC could not predict.

Conclusion: 结合显式运动学模型的强化学习方法能有效解决四足机器人配备机械臂时的控制问题，并提升性能。

Abstract: Equipping quadruped robots with manipulators provides unique
loco-manipulation capabilities, enabling diverse practical applications. This
integration creates a more complex system that has increased difficulties in
modeling and control. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising solution
to address these challenges by learning optimal control policies through
interaction. Nevertheless, RL methods often struggle with local optima when
exploring large solution spaces for motion and manipulation tasks. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a novel approach that integrates an explicit
kinematic model of the manipulator into the RL framework. This integration
provides feedback on the mapping of the body postures to the manipulator's
workspace, guiding the RL exploration process and effectively mitigating the
local optima issue. Our algorithm has been successfully deployed on a
DeepRobotics X20 quadruped robot equipped with a Unitree Z1 manipulator, and
extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of this
approach.

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种考虑导线交叉的三维导线排列优化方法，通过多目标黑盒优化确保导线不交叉并提供足够的关节扭矩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统导线排列设计依赖经验，复杂结构下难以处理，现有研究常简化问题（如限制2D平面或忽略导线交叉），因此需要更全面的优化方法。

Method: 采用多目标黑盒优化方法，考虑导线交叉，优化三维链接结构的导线排列，确保导线不交叉且满足目标轨迹的关节扭矩需求。

Result: 在多种条件下优化了三维链接结构的导线排列，验证了方法的有效性，并讨论了设计解决方案。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效解决复杂结构下的导线排列问题，为机器人设计提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Tendon-driven mechanisms are useful from the perspectives of variable
stiffness, redundant actuation, and lightweight design, and they are widely
used, particularly in hands, wrists, and waists of robots. The design of these
wire arrangements has traditionally been done empirically, but it becomes
extremely challenging when dealing with complex structures. Various studies
have attempted to optimize wire arrangement, but many of them have
oversimplified the problem by imposing conditions such as restricting movements
to a 2D plane, keeping the moment arm constant, or neglecting wire crossings.
Therefore, this study proposes a three-dimensional wire arrangement
optimization that takes wire crossings into account. We explore wire
arrangements through a multi-objective black-box optimization method that
ensures wires do not cross while providing sufficient joint torque along a
defined target trajectory. For a 3D link structure, we optimize the wire
arrangement under various conditions, demonstrate its effectiveness, and
discuss the obtained design solutions.

Result: 双臂系统在果实密度均衡时效率接近单臂的两倍，仿真显示吞吐量提升10-20%，且停止次数显著减少。

Conclusion: 优化调度方法可显著提升植物工厂中机器人采摘的可扩展性和效率。

Abstract: Plant factory cultivation is widely recognized for its ability to optimize
resource use and boost crop yields. To further increase the efficiency in these
environments, we propose a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) framework
that systematically schedules and coordinates dual-arm harvesting tasks,
minimizing the overall harvesting makespan based on pre-mapped fruit locations.
Specifically, we focus on a specialized dual-arm harvesting robot and employ
pose coverage analysis of its end effector to maximize picking reachability.
Additionally, we compare the performance of the dual-arm configuration with
that of a single-arm vehicle, demonstrating that the dual-arm system can nearly
double efficiency when fruit densities are roughly equal on both sides.
Extensive simulations show a 10-20% increase in throughput and a significant
reduction in the number of stops compared to non-optimized methods. These
results underscore the advantages of an optimal scheduling approach in
improving the scalability and efficiency of robotic harvesting in plant
factories.

Motivation: 现有轨迹细化方法常忽略轨迹间的拓扑关系，而这对预测精度至关重要。

Method: 提出Soft-Braid Refiner (SRefiner)，利用Soft-Braid Attention捕捉轨迹的软辫拓扑结构，并扩展到轨迹与车道的交互建模。

Result: 在两个数据集上显著优于四种基线方法，实现了轨迹细化的最新性能。

Conclusion: SRefiner通过引入拓扑关系，有效提升了多智能体轨迹预测的精度。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of multi-agent future trajectories is crucial for
autonomous driving systems to make safe and efficient decisions. Trajectory
refinement has emerged as a key strategy to enhance prediction accuracy.
However, existing refinement methods often overlook the topological
relationships between trajectories, which are vital for improving prediction
precision. Inspired by braid theory, we propose a novel trajectory refinement
approach, Soft-Braid Refiner (SRefiner), guided by the soft-braid topological
structure of trajectories using Soft-Braid Attention. Soft-Braid Attention
captures spatio-temporal topological relationships between trajectories by
considering both spatial proximity and vehicle motion states at ``soft
intersection points". Additionally, we extend this approach to model
interactions between trajectories and lanes, further improving the prediction
accuracy. SRefiner is a multi-iteration, multi-agent framework that iteratively
refines trajectories, incorporating topological information to enhance
interactions within traffic scenarios. SRefiner achieves significant
performance improvements over four baseline methods across two datasets,
establishing a new state-of-the-art in trajectory refinement. Code is here

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有布局生成方法存在空间幻觉问题，如物体漂浮、重叠或堆叠关系错位，无法平衡语义保真度和物理合理性。

Method: AutoLayout采用双系统框架：慢系统通过RRG管道提取物体属性和空间约束，快系统生成坐标和拓扑关系并联合验证。引入基于LLM的自适应关系库（ARL）替代手工规则。

Result: 在8种场景中验证，AutoLayout在物理合理性、语义一致性和功能完整性上比SOTA方法提升10.1%。

Conclusion: AutoLayout通过慢快协作推理和自验证机制，有效解决了空间幻觉问题，实现了布局生成的高效与准确性。

Abstract: The automated generation of layouts is vital for embodied intelligence and
autonomous systems, supporting applications from virtual environment
construction to home robot deployment. Current approaches, however, suffer from
spatial hallucination and struggle with balancing semantic fidelity and
physical plausibility, often producing layouts with deficits such as floating
or overlapping objects and misaligned stacking relation. In this paper, we
propose AutoLayout, a fully automated method that integrates a closed-loop
self-validation process within a dual-system framework. Specifically, a slow
system harnesses detailed reasoning with a Reasoning-Reflection-Generation
(RRG) pipeline to extract object attributes and spatial constraints. Then, a
fast system generates discrete coordinate sets and a topological relation set
that are jointly validated. To mitigate the limitations of handcrafted rules,
we further introduce an LLM-based Adaptive Relation Library (ARL) for
generating and evaluating layouts. Through the implementation of Slow-Fast
Collaborative Reasoning, the AutoLayout efficiently generates layouts after
thorough deliberation, effectively mitigating spatial hallucination. Its
self-validation mechanism establishes a closed-loop process that iteratively
corrects potential errors, achieving a balance between physical stability and
semantic consistency. The effectiveness of AutoLayout was validated across 8
distinct scenarios, where it demonstrated a significant 10.1% improvement over
SOTA methods in terms of physical plausibility, semantic consistency, and
functional completeness.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高速地面机器人在非结构化地形上运动时会产生高频振动，导致LiDAR扫描失真，而现有的去畸变方法难以应对快速非平滑状态变化和IMU噪声问题。

Method: 论文建模了由线性和角振动引起的去畸变误差，为每个点分配后去畸变不确定性，并利用该不确定性指导点云匹配、计算不确定性感知残差，最后使用迭代卡尔曼滤波器更新里程计状态。

Result: 在振动平台和移动平台实验中，该方法在LiDAR经历强烈振动时表现优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过引入后去畸变不确定性，有效解决了LiDAR扫描失真问题，提升了LIO系统的性能。

Abstract: High-speed ground robots moving on unstructured terrains generate intense
high-frequency vibrations, leading to LiDAR scan distortions in Lidar-inertial
odometry (LIO). Accurate and efficient undistortion is extremely challenging
due to (1) rapid and non-smooth state changes during intense vibrations and (2)
unpredictable IMU noise coupled with a limited IMU sampling frequency. To
address this issue, this paper introduces post-undistortion uncertainty. First,
we model the undistortion errors caused by linear and angular vibrations and
assign post-undistortion uncertainty to each point. We then leverage this
uncertainty to guide point-to-map matching, compute uncertainty-aware
residuals, and update the odometry states using an iterated Kalman filter. We
conduct vibration-platform and mobile-platform experiments on multiple public
datasets as well as our own recordings, demonstrating that our method achieves
better performance than other methods when LiDAR undergoes intense vibration.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需硬件的多事件相机同步方法，通过最小化事件密度分布的差异来校准时间偏移，实验表明同步误差小于10ms。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多事件相机因触发和传输延迟导致时间偏移，硬件同步方法不适用于所有相机型号，因此需要一种无需硬件的同步方法。

Method: 通过最小化不同事件相机事件密度分布的差异来确定时间偏移，并通过调整时间戳实现同步。

Result: 实验验证了该方法在多种场景和相机型号下同步误差小于10ms。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多事件相机的时间同步问题，无需额外硬件支持。

Abstract: Event cameras are a novel type of sensor designed for capturing the dynamic
changes of a scene. Due to factors such as trigger and transmission delays, a
time offset exists in the data collected by multiple event cameras, leading to
inaccurate information fusion. Thus, the collected data needs to be
synchronized to overcome any potential time offset issue. Hardware
synchronization methods require additional circuits, while certain models of
event cameras (e.g., CeleX5) do not support hardware synchronization.
Therefore, this paper proposes a hardware-free event camera synchronization
method. This method determines differences between start times by minimizing
the dissimilarity of the event density distributions of different event cameras
and synchronizes the data by adjusting timestamps. The experiments demonstrate
that the method's synchronization error is less than 10ms under various senses
with multiple models of event cameras.

Abstract: Lidar technology has been widely employed across various applications, such
as robot localization in GNSS-denied environments and 3D reconstruction. Recent
advancements have introduced different lidar types, including cost-effective
solid-state lidars such as the Livox Avia and Mid-360. The Mid-360, with its
dome-like design, is increasingly used in portable mapping and unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV) applications due to its low cost, compact size, and reliable
performance. However, the lack of datasets that include dome-shaped lidars,
such as the Mid-360, alongside other solid-state and spinning lidars
significantly hinders the comparative evaluation of novel approaches across
platforms. Additionally, performance differences between low-cost solid-state
and high-end spinning lidars (e.g., Ouster OS series) remain insufficiently
examined, particularly without an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) in odometry.
  To address this gap, we introduce a novel dataset comprising data from
multiple lidar types, including the low-cost Livox Avia and the dome-shaped
Mid-360, as well as high-end spinning lidars such as the Ouster series.
Notably, to the best of our knowledge, no existing dataset comprehensively
includes dome-shaped lidars such as Mid-360 alongside both other solid-state
and spinning lidars. In addition to the dataset, we provide a benchmark
evaluation of state-of-the-art SLAM algorithms applied to this diverse sensor
data. Furthermore, we present a quantitative analysis of point cloud
registration techniques, specifically point-to-point, point-to-plane, and
hybrid methods, using indoor and outdoor data collected from the included lidar
systems. The outcomes of this study establish a foundational reference for
future research in SLAM and 3D reconstruction across heterogeneous lidar
platforms.

Abstract: Policy learning focuses on devising strategies for agents in embodied
artificial intelligence systems to perform optimal actions based on their
perceived states. One of the key challenges in policy learning involves
handling complex, long-horizon tasks that require managing extensive sequences
of actions and observations with multiple modes. Wavelet analysis offers
significant advantages in signal processing, notably in decomposing signals at
multiple scales to capture both global trends and fine-grained details. In this
work, we introduce a novel wavelet policy learning framework that utilizes
wavelet transformations to enhance policy learning. Our approach leverages
learnable multi-scale wavelet decomposition to facilitate detailed observation
analysis and robust action planning over extended sequences. We detail the
design and implementation of our wavelet policy, which incorporates lifting
schemes for effective multi-resolution analysis and action generation. This
framework is evaluated across multiple complex scenarios, including robotic
manipulation, self-driving, and multi-robot collaboration, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our method in improving the precision and reliability of the
learned policy.

Abstract: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive and safe brain
stimulation procedure with growing applications in clinical treatments and
neuroscience research. However, achieving precise stimulation over prolonged
sessions poses significant challenges. By integrating advanced robotics with
conventional TMS, robot-assisted TMS (Robo-TMS) has emerged as a promising
solution to enhance efficacy and streamline procedures. Despite growing
interest, a comprehensive review from an engineering perspective has been
notably absent. This paper systematically examines four critical aspects of
Robo-TMS: hardware and integration, calibration and registration,
neuronavigation systems, and control systems. We review state-of-the-art
technologies in each area, identify current limitations, and propose future
research directions. Our findings suggest that broader clinical adoption of
Robo-TMS is currently limited by unverified clinical applicability, high
operational complexity, and substantial implementation costs. Emerging
technologies, including marker-less tracking, non-rigid registration,
learning-based electric field (E-field) modelling, individualised magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) generation, robot-assisted multi-locus TMS (Robo-mTMS),
and automated calibration and registration, present promising pathways to
address these challenges.

Abstract: Navigating complex, cluttered, and unstructured environments that are a
priori unknown presents significant challenges for autonomous ground vehicles,
particularly when operating with a limited field of view(FOV) resulting in
frequent occlusion and unobserved space. This paper introduces a novel
visibility-aware model predictive path integral framework(VA-MPPI). Formulated
as a dual control problem where perceptual uncertainties and control decisions
are intertwined, it reasons over perception uncertainty evolution within a
unified planning and control pipeline. Unlike traditional methods that rely on
explicit uncertainty objectives, the VA-MPPI controller implicitly balances
exploration and exploitation, reducing uncertainty only when system performance
would be increased. The VA-MPPI framework is evaluated in simulation against
deterministic and prescient controllers across multiple scenarios, including a
cluttered urban alleyway and an occluded off-road environment. The results
demonstrate that VA-MPPI significantly improves safety by reducing collision
with unseen obstacles while maintaining competitive performance. For example,
in the off-road scenario with 400 control samples, the VA-MPPI controller
achieved a success rate of 84%, compared to only 8% for the deterministic
controller, with all VA-MPPI failures arising from unmet stopping criteria
rather than collisions. Furthermore, the controller implicitly avoids
unobserved space, improving safety without explicit directives. The proposed
framework highlights the potential for robust, visibility-aware navigation in
unstructured and occluded environments, paving the way for future advancements
in autonomous ground vehicle systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统轨迹规划方法在复杂环境中难以兼顾计算效率和安全性，需要一种既能高效推理又能确保安全的新方法。

Result: 在已知和未知场景中，该方法均实现了高效推理时间，同时保持高安全性和稳定性。

Conclusion: 该方法在F1TENTH车辆上的实际应用验证了其高效性和安全性。

Abstract: Safe trajectory planning remains a significant challenge in complex
environments, where traditional methods often trade off computational
efficiency for safety. Comprehensive obstacle modeling improves safety but is
computationally expensive, while approximate methods are more efficient but may
compromise safety. To address this issue, this paper introduces a rapid and
safe trajectory planning framework based on state-based diffusion models.
Leveraging only low-dimensional vehicle states, the diffusion models achieve
notable inference efficiency while ensuring sufficient collision-free
characteristics. By composing diffusion models, the proposed framework can
safely generalize across diverse scenarios, planning collision-free
trajectories even in unseen scenes. To further ensure the safety of the
generated trajectories, an efficient, rule-based safety filter is proposed,
which selects optimal trajectories that satisfy both sufficient safety and
control feasibility from among candidate trajectories. Both in seen and unseen
scenarios, the proposed method achieves efficient inference time while
maintaining high safety and stability. Evaluations on the F1TENTH vehicle
further demonstrate that the proposed method is practical in real-world
applications. The project page is at: https://rstp-comp-diffuser.github.io/.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, operating in environments with relatively few
obstacles, offer high maneuverability and full three-dimensional mobility. This
allows them to rapidly approach objects and perform a wide range of tasks often
challenging for ground robots, making them ideal for exploration, inspection,
aerial imaging, and everyday assistance. In this paper, we introduce AirStar, a
UAV-centric embodied platform that turns a UAV into an intelligent aerial
assistant: a large language model acts as the cognitive core for environmental
understanding, contextual reasoning, and task planning. AirStar accepts natural
interaction through voice commands and gestures, removing the need for a remote
controller and significantly broadening its user base. It combines geospatial
knowledge-driven long-distance navigation with contextual reasoning for
fine-grained short-range control, resulting in an efficient and accurate
vision-and-language navigation (VLN) capability.Furthermore, the system also
offers built-in capabilities such as cross-modal question answering,
intelligent filming, and target tracking. With a highly extensible framework,
it supports seamless integration of new functionalities, paving the way toward
a general-purpose, instruction-driven intelligent UAV agent. The supplementary

Conclusion: SimLauncher证明了大规模仿真预训练对真实世界RL的潜力，为未来研究提供启发。

Abstract: Autonomous learning of dexterous, long-horizon robotic skills has been a
longstanding pursuit of embodied AI. Recent advances in robotic reinforcement
learning (RL) have demonstrated remarkable performance and robustness in
real-world visuomotor control tasks. However, applying RL in the real world
faces challenges such as low sample efficiency, slow exploration, and
significant reliance on human intervention. In contrast, simulators offer a
safe and efficient environment for extensive exploration and data collection,
while the visual sim-to-real gap, often a limiting factor, can be mitigated
using real-to-sim techniques. Building on these, we propose SimLauncher, a
novel framework that combines the strengths of real-world RL and
real-to-sim-to-real approaches to overcome these challenges. Specifically, we
first pre-train a visuomotor policy in the digital twin simulation environment,
which then benefits real-world RL in two ways: (1) bootstrapping target values
using extensive simulated demonstrations and real-world demonstrations derived
from pre-trained policy rollouts, and (2) Incorporating action proposals from
the pre-trained policy for better exploration. We conduct comprehensive
experiments across multi-stage, contact-rich, and dexterous hand manipulation
tasks. Compared to prior real-world RL approaches, SimLauncher significantly
improves sample efficiency and achieves near-perfect success rates. We hope
this work serves as a proof of concept and inspires further research on
leveraging large-scale simulation pre-training to benefit real-world robotic
RL.

Abstract: Perception-based neural network controllers are increasingly used in
autonomous systems that rely on visual inputs to operate in the real world.
Ensuring the safety of such systems under uncertainty is challenging. Existing
verification techniques typically focus on Lp-bounded perturbations in the
pixel space, which fails to capture the low-dimensional structure of many
real-world effects. In this work, we introduce a novel verification framework
for perception-based controllers that can generate outer-approximations of
reachable sets through explicitly modeling uncertain observations with
geometric perturbations. Our approach constructs a boundable mapping from
states to images, enabling the use of state-based verification tools while
accounting for uncertainty in perception. We provide theoretical guarantees on
the soundness of our method and demonstrate its effectiveness across benchmark
control environments. This work provides a principled framework for certifying
the safety of perception-driven control systems under realistic visual
perturbations.

Motivation: 扩散策略在机器人操作中表现优异，但在长时程任务和图像噪声下性能显著下降，需要改进。

Result: 仿真和真实实验均显示，VLM-TDP在成功率和长时程任务表现上显著优于传统扩散策略。

Conclusion: VLM-TDP通过轨迹条件显著提升了扩散策略在复杂任务中的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Diffusion policy has demonstrated promising performance in the field of
robotic manipulation. However, its effectiveness has been primarily limited in
short-horizon tasks, and its performance significantly degrades in the presence
of image noise. To address these limitations, we propose a VLM-guided
trajectory-conditioned diffusion policy (VLM-TDP) for robust and long-horizon
manipulation. Specifically, the proposed method leverages state-of-the-art
vision-language models (VLMs) to decompose long-horizon tasks into concise,
manageable sub-tasks, while also innovatively generating voxel-based
trajectories for each sub-task. The generated trajectories serve as a crucial
conditioning factor, effectively steering the diffusion policy and
substantially enhancing its performance. The proposed Trajectory-conditioned
Diffusion Policy (TDP) is trained on trajectories derived from demonstration
data and validated using the trajectories generated by the VLM. Simulation
experimental results indicate that our method significantly outperforms
classical diffusion policies, achieving an average 44% increase in success
rate, over 100% improvement in long-horizon tasks, and a 20% reduction in
performance degradation in challenging conditions, such as noisy images or
altered environments. These findings are further reinforced by our real-world
experiments, where the performance gap becomes even more pronounced in
long-horizon tasks. Videos are available on https://youtu.be/g0T6h32OSC8

Abstract: The extended Kalman filter (EKF) has been the industry standard for state
estimation problems over the past sixty years. The Invariant Extended Kalman
Filter (IEKF) is a recent development of the EKF for the class of group-affine
systems on Lie groups that has shown superior performance for inertial
navigation problems. The IEKF comes in two versions, left- and right- handed
respectively, and there is a perception in the robotics community that these
filters are different and one should choose the handedness of the IEKF to match
handedness of the measurement model for a given filtering problem. In this
paper, we revisit these algorithms and demonstrate that the left- and right-
IEKF algorithms (with reset step) are identical, that is, the choice of the
handedness does not affect the IEKF's performance when the reset step is
properly implemented. The reset step was not originally proposed as part of the
IEKF, however, we provide simulations to show that the reset step improves
asymptotic performance of all versions of the the filter, and should be
included in all high performance algorithms. The GNSS-aided inertial navigation
system (INS) is used as a motivating example to demonstrate the equivalence of
the two filters.

Conclusion: IDAGC框架具有推动人机协作全面发展的潜力。

Abstract: In Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC), which encompasses physical interaction
and remote cooperation, accurate estimation of human intentions and seamless
switching of collaboration modes to adjust robot behavior remain paramount
challenges. To address these issues, we propose an Intent-Driven Adaptive
Generalized Collaboration (IDAGC) framework that leverages multimodal data and
human intent estimation to facilitate adaptive policy learning across
multi-tasks in diverse scenarios, thereby facilitating autonomous inference of
collaboration modes and dynamic adjustment of robotic actions. This framework
overcomes the limitations of existing HRC methods, which are typically
restricted to a single collaboration mode and lack the capacity to identify and
transition between diverse states. Central to our framework is a predictive
model that captures the interdependencies among vision, language, force, and
robot state data to accurately recognize human intentions with a Conditional
Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) and automatically switch collaboration modes. By
employing dedicated encoders for each modality and integrating extracted
features through a Transformer decoder, the framework efficiently learns
multi-task policies, while force data optimizes compliance control and intent
estimation accuracy during physical interactions. Experiments highlights our
framework's practical potential to advance the comprehensive development of
HRC.

Conclusion: PRISM为机器人操作提供了一种鲁棒的模仿学习方法，适用于动态和密集对象环境。

Abstract: Robust imitation learning for robot manipulation requires comprehensive 3D
perception, yet many existing methods struggle in cluttered environments. Fixed
camera view approaches are vulnerable to perspective changes, and 3D point
cloud techniques often limit themselves to keyframes predictions, reducing
their efficacy in dynamic, contact-intensive tasks. To address these
challenges, we propose PRISM, designed as an end-to-end framework that directly
learns from raw point cloud observations and robot states, eliminating the need
for pretrained models or external datasets. PRISM comprises three main
components: a segmentation embedding unit that partitions the raw point cloud
into distinct object clusters and encodes local geometric details; a
cross-attention component that merges these visual features with processed
robot joint states to highlight relevant targets; and a diffusion module that
translates the fused representation into smooth robot actions. With training on
100 demonstrations per task, PRISM surpasses both 2D and 3D baseline policies
in accuracy and efficiency within our simulated environments, demonstrating
strong robustness in complex, object-dense scenarios. Code and some demos are

Abstract: Navigation is a fundamental capacity for mobile robots, enabling them to
operate autonomously in complex and dynamic environments. Conventional
approaches use probabilistic models to localize robots and build maps
simultaneously using sensor observations. Recent approaches employ
human-inspired learning, such as imitation and reinforcement learning, to
navigate robots more effectively. However, these methods suffer from high
computational costs, global map inconsistency, and poor generalization to
unseen environments. This paper presents a novel method inspired by how humans
perceive and navigate themselves effectively in novel environments.
Specifically, we first build local frames that mimic how humans represent
essential spatial information in the short term. Points in local frames are
hybrid representations, including spatial information and learned features,
so-called spatial-implicit local frames. Then, we integrate spatial-implicit
local frames into the global topological map represented as a factor graph.
Lastly, we developed a novel navigation algorithm based on Rapid-Exploring
Random Tree Star (RRT*) that leverages spatial-implicit local frames and the
topological map to navigate effectively in environments. To validate our
approach, we conduct extensive experiments in real-world datasets and in-lab
environments. We open our source code at

Abstract: We introduce Dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Expert Networks (DRAE), a
groundbreaking architecture that addresses the challenges of lifelong learning,
catastrophic forgetting, and task adaptation by combining the dynamic routing
capabilities of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE); leveraging the knowledge-enhancement
power of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG); incorporating a novel
hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL) framework; and coordinating through
ReflexNet-SchemaPlanner-HyperOptima (RSHO).DRAE dynamically routes expert
models via a sparse MoE gating mechanism, enabling efficient resource
allocation while leveraging external knowledge through parametric retrieval
(P-RAG) to augment the learning process. We propose a new RL framework with
ReflexNet for low-level task execution, SchemaPlanner for symbolic reasoning,
and HyperOptima for long-term context modeling, ensuring continuous adaptation
and memory retention. Experimental results show that DRAE significantly
outperforms baseline approaches in long-term task retention and knowledge
reuse, achieving an average task success rate of 82.5% across a set of dynamic
robotic manipulation tasks, compared to 74.2% for traditional MoE models.
Furthermore, DRAE maintains an extremely low forgetting rate, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods in catastrophic forgetting mitigation. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enabling flexible, scalable,

generation, MOSU leverages multi-modalities: LiDAR-based geometric data for
precise obstacle avoidance, image-based semantic segmentation for
traversability assessment, and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to capture social
context and enable the robot to adhere to social norms in complex environments.
This multi-modal integration improves scene understanding and enhances
traversability, allowing the robot to adapt to diverse outdoor conditions. We
evaluate our system in real-world on-road environments and benchmark it on the

terrains while maintaining a comparable navigation distance to existing global

Conclusion: 相对反馈是一种有效且实用的强化学习增强工具，尤其在稀疏奖励场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Human guidance has emerged as a powerful tool for enhancing reinforcement
learning (RL). However, conventional forms of guidance such as demonstrations
or binary scalar feedback can be challenging to collect or have low information
content, motivating the exploration of other forms of human input. Among these,
relative feedback (i.e., feedback on how to improve an action, such as "more to
the left") offers a good balance between usability and information richness.
Previous research has shown that relative feedback can be used to enhance
policy search methods. However, these efforts have been limited to specific
policy classes and use feedback inefficiently. In this work, we introduce a
novel method to learn from relative feedback and combine it with off-policy
reinforcement learning. Through evaluations on two sparse-reward tasks, we
demonstrate our method can be used to improve the sample efficiency of
reinforcement learning by guiding its exploration process. Additionally, we
show it can adapt a policy to changes in the environment or the user's
preferences. Finally, we demonstrate real-world applicability by employing our
approach to learn a navigation policy in a sparse reward setting.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved
performance in embodied tasks such as goal decomposition and visual
comprehension. However, providing accurate rewards for robotic manipulation
without fine-tuning VLMs remains challenging due to the absence of
domain-specific robotic knowledge in pre-trained datasets and high
computational costs that hinder real-time applicability. To address this, we
propose $\mathrm{T}^2$-VLM, a novel training-free, temporally consistent
framework that generates accurate rewards through tracking the status changes
in VLM-derived subgoals. Specifically, our method first queries the VLM to
establish spatially aware subgoals and an initial completion estimate before
each round of interaction. We then employ a Bayesian tracking algorithm to
update the goal completion status dynamically, using subgoal hidden states to
generate structured rewards for reinforcement learning (RL) agents. This
approach enhances long-horizon decision-making and improves failure recovery
capabilities with RL. Extensive experiments indicate that $\mathrm{T}^2$-VLM
achieves state-of-the-art performance in two robot manipulation benchmarks,
demonstrating superior reward accuracy with reduced computation consumption. We

*Giwon Lee,Wooseong Jeong,Daehee Park,Jaewoo Jeong,Kuk-Jin Yoon*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为IMMP的新方法，通过结合不同域的参数检查点，解决运动规划中的域适应问题，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于代理交互和环境特征的差异，现有轨迹数据集难以有效用于目标域，传统方法存在域不平衡、灾难性遗忘和高计算成本等问题。

Method: IMMP采用两步法：预合并以捕捉代理行为和交互，充分提取源域信息；合并构建可适应模型，高效转移交互到目标域。

Result: 在多种规划基准和模型上评估，IMMP表现优于传统方法。

Conclusion: IMMP通过有效结合源域信息，显著提升了运动规划在目标域的性能。

Abstract: Motion planning is a crucial component of autonomous robot driving. While
various trajectory datasets exist, effectively utilizing them for a target
domain remains challenging due to differences in agent interactions and
environmental characteristics. Conventional approaches, such as domain
adaptation or ensemble learning, leverage multiple source datasets but suffer
from domain imbalance, catastrophic forgetting, and high computational costs.
To address these challenges, we propose Interaction-Merged Motion Planning
(IMMP), a novel approach that leverages parameter checkpoints trained on
different domains during adaptation to the target domain. IMMP follows a
two-step process: pre-merging to capture agent behaviors and interactions,
sufficiently extracting diverse information from the source domain, followed by
merging to construct an adaptable model that efficiently transfers diverse
interactions to the target domain. Our method is evaluated on various planning
benchmarks and models, demonstrating superior performance compared to
conventional approaches.

Conclusion: 为自动驾驶系统在复杂环境中的可靠性和安全性提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems have made significant advances in Q&A, perception,
prediction, and planning based on local visual information, yet they struggle
to incorporate broader navigational context that human drivers routinely
utilize. We address this critical gap between local sensor data and global
navigation information by proposing NavigScene, an auxiliary navigation-guided
natural language dataset that simulates a human-like driving environment within
autonomous driving systems. Moreover, we develop three complementary paradigms
to leverage NavigScene: (1) Navigation-guided Reasoning, which enhances
vision-language models by incorporating navigation context into the prompting
approach; (2) Navigation-guided Preference Optimization, a reinforcement
learning method that extends Direct Preference Optimization to improve
vision-language model responses by establishing preferences for
navigation-relevant summarized information; and (3) Navigation-guided
Vision-Language-Action model, which integrates navigation guidance and
vision-language models with conventional driving models through feature fusion.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approaches significantly improve
performance across perception, prediction, planning, and question-answering
tasks by enabling reasoning capabilities beyond visual range and improving
generalization to diverse driving scenarios. This work represents a significant
step toward more comprehensive autonomous driving systems capable of navigating
complex, unfamiliar environments with greater reliability and safety.

Result: 实验表明，系统显著提高了操作安全性，同时不影响任务效率。

Conclusion: 该系统为杂乱环境中的精确遥操作提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Teleoperating precise bimanual manipulations in cluttered environments is
challenging for operators, who often struggle with limited spatial perception
and difficulty estimating distances between target objects, the robot's body,
obstacles, and the surrounding environment. To address these challenges, local
robot perception and control should assist the operator during teleoperation.
In this work, we introduce a safe teleoperation system that enhances operator
control by preventing collisions in cluttered environments through the
combination of immersive VR control and voice-activated collision avoidance.
Using HTC Vive controllers, operators directly control a bimanual mobile
manipulator, while spoken commands such as "avoid the yellow tool" trigger
visual grounding and segmentation to build 3D obstacle meshes. These meshes are
integrated into a whole-body controller to actively prevent collisions during
teleoperation. Experiments in static, cluttered scenes demonstrate that our
system significantly improves operational safety without compromising task
efficiency.

Result: 渐近分析与数值模拟结果一致，揭示了驱动频率和结构参数对对称解稳定性及分岔的影响。

Conclusion: 被动形状变量在非完整系统运动中能产生多稳态周期解，为机器人运动控制提供了新视角。

Abstract: The nonlinear dynamics of many under-actuated wheeled platforms are governed
by nonholonomic constraints of no-skid for passively rolling wheels, coupled
with momentum balance. In most of theoretical models, the shape variables, i.e.
joint angles, are directly prescribed as periodic inputs, such as steering
angle of the Twistcar. In this work, we study a variant of the Twistcar model
where the actuation input is periodic oscillations of an inertial rotor
attached to the main body, while the steering joint is passively free to
rotate. Remarkably, the dynamics of this model is extremely rich, and includes
multiplicity of periodic solutions, both symmetric and asymmetric, as well as
stability transitions and bifurcations. We conduct numerical simulations as
well as asymptotic analysis of the vehicle's reduced equations of motion. We
use perturbation expansion in order to obtain leading-order dynamics under
symmetric periodic solution. Then, we utilize harmonic balance and further
scaling assumptions in order to approximate the conditions for
symmetry-breaking pitchfork bifurcation and stability transition of the
symmetric periodic solution, as a function of actuation frequency and
structural parameters. The asymptotic results show good agreement with
numerical simulations. The results highlight the role of passive shape
variables in generating multi-stable periodic solutions for nonholonomic
systems of robotic locomotion.

Result: 在零售环境中，机器人定位的相对姿态误差为0.83米，100多个物品的对象映射位置误差为0.97米。

Conclusion: Piggyback Camera系统是一种高效且易于部署的视觉监控解决方案，适用于商用机器人。

Abstract: This paper presents Piggyback Camera, an easy-to-deploy system for visual
surveillance using commercial robot vacuums. Rather than requiring access to
internal robot systems, our approach mounts a smartphone equipped with a camera
and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) on the robot, making it applicable to any
commercial robot without hardware modifications. The system estimates robot
poses through neural inertial navigation and efficiently captures images at
regular spatial intervals throughout the cleaning task. We develop a novel
test-time data augmentation method called Rotation-Augmented Ensemble (RAE) to
mitigate domain gaps in neural inertial navigation. A loop closure method that
exploits robot cleaning patterns further refines these estimated poses. We
demonstrate the system with an object mapping application that analyzes
captured images to geo-localize objects in the environment. Experimental
evaluation in retail environments shows that our approach achieves 0.83 m
relative pose error for robot localization and 0.97 m positional error for
object mapping of over 100 items.

Conclusion: 所提方法显著提升了检测的自动化水平，解决了现有问题。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are critical in the automated inspection of
wind turbine blades. Nevertheless, several issues persist in this domain.
Firstly, existing inspection platforms encounter challenges in meeting the
demands of automated inspection tasks and scenarios. Moreover, current blade
stop angle estimation methods are vulnerable to environmental factors,
restricting their robustness. Additionally, there is an absence of real-time
blade detail prioritized exposure adjustment during capture, where lost details
cannot be restored through post-optimization. To address these challenges, we
introduce a platform and two approaches. Initially, a UAV inspection platform
is presented to meet the automated inspection requirements. Subsequently, a
Fermat point based blade stop angle estimation approach is introduced,
achieving higher precision and success rates. Finally, we propose a blade
detail prioritized exposure adjustment approach to ensure appropriate
brightness and preserve details during image capture. Extensive tests,
comprising over 120 flights across 10 wind turbine models in 5 operational wind
farms, validate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches in enhancing
inspection autonomy.

Result: 实验证明TTTS在多种机器人任务中（如逆运动学、障碍物运动规划）高效且能收敛到全局最优解。

Conclusion: TTTS通过张量分解显著提升了优化效率，适用于广泛的机器人任务。

Abstract: Many robotic tasks, such as inverse kinematics, motion planning, and optimal
control, can be formulated as optimization problems. Solving these problems
involves addressing nonlinear kinematics, complex contact dynamics, and
long-horizon planning, each posing distinct challenges for state-of-the-art
optimization methods. To efficiently solve a wide range of tasks across varying
scenarios, researchers either develop specialized algorithms for the task to
achieve, or switch between different frameworks. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
is a general-purpose decision-making tool that enables strategic exploration
across problem instances without relying on task-specific structures. However,
MCTS suffers from combinatorial complexity, leading to slow convergence and
high memory usage. To address this limitation, we propose \emph{Tensor Train
Tree Search} (TTTS), which leverages tensor factorization to exploit the
separable structure of decision trees. This yields a low-rank,
linear-complexity representation that significantly reduces both computation
time and storage requirements. We prove that TTTS can efficiently reach the
bounded global optimum within a finite time. Experimental results across
inverse kinematics, motion planning around obstacles, multi-stage motion
planning, and bimanual whole-body manipulation demonstrate the efficiency of
TTTS on a diverse set of robotic tasks.

Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction is critical for safe autonomous navigation,

This work systematically examines how feature selection, cross-dataset
transfer, and geographic diversity influence trajectory prediction accuracy in
multi-agent settings. We evaluate a state-of-the-art model using our novel L4
Motion Forecasting dataset based on our own data recordings in Germany and the
US. This includes enhanced map and agent features. We compare our dataset to
the US-centric Argoverse 2 benchmark. First, we find that incorporating
supplementary map and agent features unique to our dataset, yields no
measurable improvement over baseline features, demonstrating that modern
architectures do not need extensive feature sets for optimal performance. The
limited features of public datasets are sufficient to capture convoluted
interactions without added complexity. Second, we perform cross-dataset
experiments to evaluate how effective domain knowledge can be transferred
between datasets. Third, we group our dataset by country and check the
knowledge transfer between different driving cultures.

Abstract: In the field of robotics, researchers face a critical challenge in ensuring
reliable and efficient task planning. Verifying high-level task plans before
execution significantly reduces errors and enhance the overall performance of
these systems. In this paper, we propose an architecture for automatically
verifying high-level task plans before their execution in simulator or
real-world environments. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), our approach
consists of two key steps: first, the conversion of natural language
instructions into Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), followed by a comprehensive
analysis of action sequences. The module uses the reasoning capabilities of the
LLM to evaluate logical coherence and identify potential gaps in the plan.
Rigorous testing on datasets of varying complexity demonstrates the broad
applicability of the module to household tasks. We contribute to improving the
reliability and efficiency of task planning and addresses the critical need for
robust pre-execution verification in autonomous systems. The code is available

Abstract: The specification and validation of robotics applications require bridging
the gap between formulating requirements and systematic testing. This often
involves manual and error-prone tasks that become more complex as requirements,
design, and implementation evolve. To address this challenge systematically, we
propose extending behaviour-driven development (BDD) to define and verify
acceptance criteria for robotic systems. In this context, we use
domain-specific modelling and represent composable BDD models as knowledge
graphs for robust querying and manipulation, facilitating the generation of
executable testing models. A domain-specific language helps to efficiently
specify robotic acceptance criteria. We explore the potential for automated
generation and execution of acceptance tests through a software architecture
that integrates a BDD framework, Isaac Sim, and model transformations, focusing
on acceptance criteria for pick-and-place applications. We tested this
architecture with an existing pick-and-place implementation and evaluated the
execution results, which shows how this application behaves and fails
differently when tested against variations of the agent and environment. This
research advances the rigorous and automated evaluation of robotic systems,
contributing to their reliability and trustworthiness.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在机器人任务规划中因依赖文本输入而难以适应现实世界变化和失败的问题。

Method: 提出LERa框架，包括Look（生成场景描述和识别错误）、Explain（提供纠正指导）和Replan（修改计划）三个步骤。

Result: 在ALFRED-ChaOS和VirtualHome-ChaOS数据集上提升40%性能，在PyBullet模拟器中成功率提升67%。

Conclusion: LERa是一种鲁棒且适应性强的解决方案，适用于机器人任务执行中的错误感知重规划。

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly used in robotics for task planning,
but their reliance on textual inputs limits their adaptability to real-world
changes and failures. To address these challenges, we propose LERa - Look,
Explain, Replan - a Visual Language Model-based replanning approach that
utilizes visual feedback. Unlike existing methods, LERa requires only a raw RGB
image, a natural language instruction, an initial task plan, and failure
detection - without additional information such as object detection or
predefined conditions that may be unavailable in a given scenario. The
replanning process consists of three steps: (i) Look, where LERa generates a
scene description and identifies errors; (ii) Explain, where it provides
corrective guidance; and (iii) Replan, where it modifies the plan accordingly.
LERa is adaptable to various agent architectures and can handle errors from
both dynamic scene changes and task execution failures. We evaluate LERa on the
newly introduced ALFRED-ChaOS and VirtualHome-ChaOS datasets, achieving a 40%
improvement over baselines in dynamic environments. In tabletop manipulation
tasks with a predefined probability of task failure within the PyBullet
simulator, LERa improves success rates by up to 67%. Further experiments,
including real-world trials with a tabletop manipulator robot, confirm LERa's
effectiveness in replanning. We demonstrate that LERa is a robust and adaptable
solution for error-aware task execution in robotics. The code is available at

Conclusion: EmbodieDreamer有效减小了Real2Sim2Real差距，提升了机器人策略在真实环境中的表现。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Embodied AI has led to an increasing demand for
large-scale, high-quality real-world data. However, collecting such embodied
data remains costly and inefficient. As a result, simulation environments have
become a crucial surrogate for training robot policies. Yet, the significant
Real2Sim2Real gap remains a critical bottleneck, particularly in terms of
physical dynamics and visual appearance. To address this challenge, we propose
EmbodieDreamer, a novel framework that reduces the Real2Sim2Real gap from both
the physics and appearance perspectives. Specifically, we propose PhysAligner,
a differentiable physics module designed to reduce the Real2Sim physical gap.
It jointly optimizes robot-specific parameters such as control gains and
friction coefficients to better align simulated dynamics with real-world
observations. In addition, we introduce VisAligner, which incorporates a
conditional video diffusion model to bridge the Sim2Real appearance gap by
translating low-fidelity simulated renderings into photorealistic videos
conditioned on simulation states, enabling high-fidelity visual transfer.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of EmbodieDreamer. The
proposed PhysAligner reduces physical parameter estimation error by 3.74%
compared to simulated annealing methods while improving optimization speed by
89.91\%. Moreover, training robot policies in the generated photorealistic
environment leads to a 29.17% improvement in the average task success rate
across real-world tasks after reinforcement learning. Code, model and data will
be publicly available.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) in real-world settings requires agents
to process continuous visual streams and generate actions with low latency
grounded in language instructions. While Video-based Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs) have driven recent progress, current VLN methods based on
Video-LLM often face trade-offs among fine-grained visual understanding,
long-term context modeling and computational efficiency. We introduce
StreamVLN, a streaming VLN framework that employs a hybrid slow-fast context
modeling strategy to support multi-modal reasoning over interleaved vision,
language and action inputs. The fast-streaming dialogue context facilitates
responsive action generation through a sliding-window of active dialogues,
while the slow-updating memory context compresses historical visual states
using a 3D-aware token pruning strategy. With this slow-fast design, StreamVLN
achieves coherent multi-turn dialogue through efficient KV cache reuse,
supporting long video streams with bounded context size and inference cost.
Experiments on VLN-CE benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with
stable low latency, ensuring robustness and efficiency in real-world
deployment. The project page is:

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising framework for autonomous
driving by enabling agents to learn control policies through interaction with
environments. However, large and high-dimensional action spaces often used to
support fine-grained control can impede training efficiency and increase
exploration costs. In this study, we introduce and evaluate two novel
structured action space modification strategies for RL in autonomous driving:
dynamic masking and relative action space reduction. These approaches are
systematically compared against fixed reduction schemes and full action space
baselines to assess their impact on policy learning and performance. Our
framework leverages a multimodal Proximal Policy Optimization agent that
processes both semantic image sequences and scalar vehicle states. The proposed
dynamic and relative strategies incorporate real-time action masking based on
context and state transitions, preserving action consistency while eliminating
invalid or suboptimal choices. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse
driving routes, we show that action space reduction significantly improves
training stability and policy performance. The dynamic and relative schemes, in
particular, achieve a favorable balance between learning speed, control
precision, and generalization. These findings highlight the importance of
context-aware action space design for scalable and reliable RL in autonomous
driving tasks.

Motivation: 电商平台上，卖家的广告投放与总销售额关系不明确，导致运营效率低下。全站推广服务QuanZhanTui的引入需要解决机制设计问题。

Conclusion: LPA为全站推广服务提供了一种高效的拍卖机制，显著提升了营销效率和平台收入。

Abstract: On e-commerce platforms, sellers typically bid for impressions from ad
traffic to promote their products. However, for most sellers, the majority of
their sales come from organic traffic. Consequently, the relationship between
their ad spending and total sales remains uncertain, resulting in operational
inefficiency. To address this issue, e-commerce platforms have recently
introduced a novel platform-wide marketing service known as QuanZhanTui, which
has reportedly enhanced marketing efficiency for sellers and driven substantial
revenue growth for platforms. QuanZhanTui allows sellers to bid for impressions
from the platform's entire traffic to boost their total sales without
compromising the platform's user experience. In this paper, we investigate the
mechanism design problem that arises from QuanZhanTui. The problem is
formulated as a multi-objective optimization to balance sellers' welfare and
platform's user experience. We first introduce the stock-constrained value
maximizer model, which reflects sellers' dual requirements on marketing
efficiency and platform-wide ROI. Then, we propose the Liquid Payment Auction
(LPA), an auction designed to optimize the balanced objectives while accounting
for sellers' requirements in the auto-bidding environment. It employs a simple
payment rule based on sellers' liquid welfare, providing a clearer link between
their investment and total sales. Under mild assumptions, we theoretically
prove desirable properties of LPA, such as optimality and incentive
compatibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate LPA's superior performance

Abstract: Bargaining games, where agents attempt to agree on how to split utility, are
an important class of games used to study economic behavior, which motivates a
study of online learning algorithms in these games. In this work, we tackle
when no-regret learning algorithms converge to Nash equilibria in bargaining
games. Recent results have shown that online algorithms related to Follow the
Regularized Leader (FTRL) converge to Nash equilibria (NE) in the last iterate
in a wide variety of games, including zero-sum games. However, bargaining games
do not have the properties used previously to established convergence
guarantees, even in the simplest case of the ultimatum game, which features a
single take-it-or-leave-it offer. Nonetheless, we establish that FTRL (without
the modifications necessary for zero-sum games) achieves last-iterate
convergence to an approximate NE in the ultimatum game along with a bound on
convergence time under mild assumptions. Further, we provide experimental
results to demonstrate that convergence to NE, including NE with asymmetric
payoffs, occurs under a broad range of initial conditions, both in the
ultimatum game and in bargaining games with multiple rounds. This work
demonstrates how complex economic behavior (e.g. learning to use threats and
the existence of many possible equilibrium outcomes) can result from using a
simple learning algorithm, and that FTRL can converge to equilibria in a more
diverse set of games than previously known.

Abstract: Building on the linear programming approach to competitive equilibrium
pricing, we develop a general method for constructing iterative auctions that
achieve Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) outcomes. We show how to transform a linear
program characterizing competitive equilibrium prices into one that
characterizes universal competitive equilibrium (UCE) prices, which elicit
precisely the information needed to compute VCG payments. By applying a
primal-dual algorithm to these transformed programs, we derive iterative
Vickrey auctions that maintain a single price path, eliminating the overhead
and incentive problems associated with multiple price paths used solely for
payment calculations. We demonstrate the versatility of our method by
developing a novel iterative Vickrey auction for the multi-unit setting and an
iterative variant of the Product-Mix auction. The resulting auctions combine
the transparency of iterative price discovery with the efficiency and incentive
properties of the VCG mechanism.

Result: PS机制在基数偏好下保证(ln(n)+2)-近似帕累托效率，并在家务分配中证明n-近似效率。

Conclusion: 论文填补了PS机制效率分析的空白，为公平高效分配提供了理论支持。

Abstract: The Probabilistic Serial (PS) mechanism -- also known as the simultaneous
eating algorithm -- is a canonical solution for the assignment problem under
ordinal preferences. It guarantees envy-freeness and ordinal efficiency in the
resulting random assignment. However, under cardinal preferences, its
efficiency may degrade significantly: it is known that PS may yield allocations
that are $\Omega(\ln{n})$-worse than Pareto optimal, but whether this bound is
tight remained an open question.
  Our first result resolves this question by showing that the PS mechanism
guarantees $(\ln(n)+2)$-approximate Pareto efficiency, even in the more general
submodular setting introduced by Fujishige, Sano, and Zhan (ACM TEAC 2018).
This is established by showing that, although the PS mechanism may incur a loss
of up to $O(\sqrt{n})$ in utilitarian social welfare, it still achieves a
$(\ln{n}+2)$-approximation to the maximum Nash welfare. In addition, we present
a polynomial-time algorithm that computes an allocation which is envy-free and
$e^{1/e}$-approximately Pareto-efficient, answering an open question posed by
Tr\"obst and Vazirani (EC 2024).
  The PS mechanism also applies to the allocation of chores instead of goods.
We prove that it guarantees an $n$-approximately Pareto-efficient allocation in
this setting, and that this bound is asymptotically tight. This result provides
the first known approximation guarantee for computing a fair and efficient
allocation in the assignment problem with chores under cardinal preferences.

Abstract: Markov games with coupling constraints provide a natural framework to study
constrained decision-making involving self-interested agents, where the
feasibility of an individual agent's strategy depends on the joint strategies
of the others. Such games arise in numerous real-world applications involving
safety requirements and budget caps, for example, in environmental management,
electricity markets, and transportation systems. While correlated equilibria
have emerged as an important solution concept in unconstrained settings due to
their computational tractability and amenability to learning, their constrained
counterparts remain less explored. In this paper, we study constrained
correlated equilibria-feasible policies where any unilateral modifications are
either unprofitable or infeasible. We first characterize the constrained
correlated equilibrium showing that different sets of modifications result in
an equivalent notion, a result which may enable efficient learning algorithms.
We then address existence conditions. In particular, we show that a strong
Slater-type condition is necessary in games with playerwise coupling
constraints, but can be significantly weakened when all players share common
coupling constraints. Under this relaxed condition, we prove the existence of a
constrained correlated equilibrium.

Motivation: 解决不可分割混合物品在多个代理之间的公平分配问题，尤其是在放松嫉妒自由和帕累托效率的条件下。

Method: 使用EFR-k（嫉妒自由至多k次重新分配）和帕累托效率作为标准，结合KKM定理和加权福利最大化方法。

Result: 证明了EFR-(n-1)和PO分配总是存在，且当代理数固定时可高效计算；对于纯物品，EFR-⌊n/2⌋分配也存在且可高效计算。

Conclusion: 论文通过KKM定理和加权福利最大化方法，为不可分割混合物品的公平高效分配提供了理论和计算基础。

Abstract: We study fair division of indivisible mixed manna (items whose values may be
positive, negative, or zero) among agents with additive valuations. Here, we
establish that fairness -- in terms of a relaxation of envy-freeness -- and
Pareto efficiency can always be achieved together. Specifically, our fairness
guarantees are in terms of envy-freeness up to $k$ reallocations (EFR-$k$): An
allocation $A$ of the indivisible items is said to be EFR-$k$ if there exists a
subset $R$ of at most $k$ items such that, for each agent $i$, we can reassign
items from within $R$ (in $A$) and obtain an allocation, $A^i$, which is
envy-free for $i$. We establish that, when allocating mixed manna among $n$
agents with additive valuations, an EFR-$(n-1)$ and Pareto optimal (PO)
allocation $A$ always exists. Further, the individual envy-free allocations
$A^i$, induced by reassignments, are also PO. In addition, we prove that such
fair and efficient allocations are efficiently computable when the number of
agents, $n$, is fixed.
  We also obtain positive results focusing on EFR by itself (and without the PO
desideratum). Specifically, we show that an EFR-$(n-1)$ allocation of mixed
manna can be computed in polynomial time. In addition, we prove that when all
the items are goods, an EFR-${\lfloor n/2 \rfloor}$ allocation exists and can
be computed efficiently. Here, the $(n-1)$ bound is tight for chores and
$\lfloor n/2 \rfloor$ is tight for goods.
  Our results advance the understanding of fair and efficient allocation of
indivisible mixed manna and rely on a novel application of the
Knaster-Kuratowski-Mazurkiewicz (KKM) Theorem in discrete fair division. We
utilize weighted welfare maximization, with perturbed valuations, to achieve
Pareto efficiency, and overall, our techniques are notably different from
existing market-based approaches.

Conclusion: 本文提出的机制在事前激励兼容性下实现了收入的最大化近似，并扩展到多单位需求场景。

Abstract: This paper studies mechanism design for revenue maximization in a
distribution-reporting setting, where the auctioneer does not know the buyers'
true value distributions. Instead, each buyer reports and commits to a bid
distribution in the ex-ante stage, which the auctioneer uses as input to the
mechanism. Buyers strategically decide the reported distributions to maximize
ex-ante utility, potentially deviating from their value distributions. As shown
in previous work, classical prior-dependent mechanisms such as the Myerson
auction fail to elicit truthful value distributions at the ex-ante stage,
despite satisfying Bayesian incentive compatibility at the interim stage. We
study the design of ex-ante incentive compatible mechanisms, and aim to
maximize revenue in a prior-independent approximation framework. We introduce a
family of threshold-augmented mechanisms, which ensures ex-ante incentive
compatibility while boosting revenue through ex-ante thresholds. Based on these
mechanisms, we construct the Peer-Max Mechanism, which achieves an either-or
approximation guarantee for general non-identical distributions. Specifically,
for any value distributions, its expected revenue either achieves a constant
fraction of the optimal social welfare, or surpasses the second-price revenue
by a constant fraction, where the constants depend on the number of buyers and
a tunable parameter. We also provide an upper bound on the revenue achievable
by any ex-ante incentive compatible mechanism, matching our lower bound up to a
constant factor. Finally, we extend our approach to a setting where multiple
units of identical items are sold to buyers with multi-unit demands.

Result: 成功表征了最优机制，并开发了用于寻找最优或接近最优确定性机制的高效算法。

Conclusion: 研究为买家不确定价值情况下的机制设计提供了理论支持和实用工具。

Abstract: We consider a mechanism design setting with a single item and a single buyer
who is uncertain about the value of the item. Both the buyer and the seller
have a common model for the buyer's value, but the buyer discovers her true
value only upon receiving the item. Mechanisms in this setting can be
interpreted as randomized refund mechanisms, which allocate the item at some
price and then offer a (partial and/or randomized) refund to the buyer in
exchange for the item if the buyer is unsatisfied with her purchase. Motivated
by their practical importance, we study the design of optimal deterministic
mechanisms in this setting. We characterize optimal mechanisms as virtual value
maximizers for both continuous and discrete type settings. We then use this
characterization, along with bounds on the menu size complexity, to develop
efficient algorithms for finding optimal and near-optimal deterministic
mechanisms.

Method: 使用多项式时间近似算法，包括随机算法和确定性算法，结合线性规划松弛和相关间隙分析。

Result: 针对不同场景，算法实现了$(\frac{1}{2} - \epsilon)$或$(1 - \frac{1}{e} - \epsilon)$的近似保证。

Conclusion: 论文为双边匹配平台的收入最大化提供了高效且理论保证的解决方案。

Abstract: We study adaptive two-sided assortment optimization for revenue maximization
in choice-based matching platforms. The platform has two sides of agents, an
initiating side, and a responding side. The decision-maker sequentially selects
agents from the initiating side, shows each an assortment of agents from the
responding side, and observes their choices. After processing all initiating
agents, the responding agents are shown assortments and make their selections.
A match occurs when two agents mutually select each other, generating
pair-dependent revenue. Choices follow Multinomial Logit (MNL) models. This
setting generalizes prior work focused on maximizing the number of matches
under submodular demand assumptions, which do not hold in our
revenue-maximization context. Our main contribution is the design of
polynomial-time approximation algorithms with constant-factor guarantees. In
particular, for general pairwise revenues, we develop a randomized algorithm
that achieves a $(\frac{1}{2} - \epsilon)$-approximation in expectation for any
$\epsilon > 0$. The algorithm is static and provides guarantees under various
agent arrival settings, including fixed order, simultaneous processing, and
adaptive selection. When revenues are uniform across all pairs involving any
given responding-side agent, the guarantee improves to $(1 - \frac{1}{e} -
\epsilon)$. In structural settings where responding-side agents share a common
revenue-based ranking, we design a simpler adaptive deterministic algorithm
achieving a $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation. Our approach leverages novel linear
programming relaxations, correlation gap arguments, and structural properties
of the revenue functions.

Result: 第一种机制近似最优且策略证明，但输入变化大；第二种机制在此基础上增加Lipschitz连续性。

Conclusion: 通过放宽条件，成功设计出近似最优且稳定的双设施选址机制。

Abstract: We study deterministic mechanisms for the two-facility location problem.
Given the reported locations of n agents on the real line, such a mechanism
specifies where to build the two facilities. The single-facility variant of
this problem admits a simple strategyproof mechanism that minimizes social
cost. For two facilities, however, it is known that any strategyproof mechanism
is $\Omega(n)$-approximate. We seek to circumvent this strong lower bound by
relaxing the problem requirements. Following other work in the facility
location literature, we consider a relaxed form of strategyproofness in which
no agent can lie and improve their outcome by more than a constant factor.
Because the aforementioned $\Omega(n)$ lower bound generalizes easily to
constant-strategyproof mechanisms, we introduce a second relaxation: Allowing
the facilities (but not the agents) to be located in the plane. Our first main
result is a natural mechanism for this relaxation that is constant-approximate
and constant-strategyproof. A characteristic of this mechanism is that a small
change in the input profile can produce a large change in the solution.
Motivated by this observation, and also by results in the facility reallocation
literature, our second main result is a constant-approximate,
constant-strategyproof, and Lipschitz continuous mechanism.

Motivation: 研究如何在拟阵可行性约束下设计收益最优、真实可信的拍卖机制，克服Akbarpour和Li (2020)提出的无限通信需求问题。

Method: 扩展了Ferreira和Weinberg (2020)及Chitra等 (2024)的Deferred-Revelation Auction (DRA)方法，结合加密承诺和区块链技术，适用于拟阵环境。

Result: 证明DRA在拟阵环境中满足真实性、可信性和收益最优性，但对非拟阵约束或较小押金不可信。

Conclusion: DRA在拟阵环境中有效，但需进一步研究其适用范围和优化机制设计。

Abstract: We consider a revenue-optimizing auctioneer in single-dimensional
environments with matroid feasibility constraints. Akbarpour and Li (2020)
argue that any revenue-optimal, truthful, and credible mechanism requires
unbounded communication. Recent works (Ferreira and Weinberg, 2020; Essaidi et
al., 2022; Chitra et al., 2024) circumvent their impossibility for the
single-item setting through the use of cryptographic commitments and
blockchains. We extend their results to matroid feasibility constraints.
  At a high level, the two-round Deferred-Revelation Auction (DRA) discussed by
Ferreira and Weinberg (2020) and Chitra et al., (2024) requires each bidder to
submit a deposit, which is slashed upon presenting verifiable evidence
indicating a deviation from the behaviour prescribed by the mechanism. We prove
that the DRA satisfies truthfulness, credibility and revenue-optimality for all
matroid environments when bidders' values are drawn from $\alpha$-strongly
regular distributions for $\alpha > 0$. Further, we argue that the DRA is not
credible for any feasibility constraint beyond matroids and for any smaller
deposits than suggested by previous literature even in single-item
environments.
  Finally, we modify the Ascending Deferred-Revelation Auction (ADRA) for
single-item settings proposed by Essaidi et al., (2022) for arbitrary bidder
value distributions. We implement a deferred-revelation variant of the
deferred-acceptance auction for matroids due to Bikhchandani et al., (2011),
which requires the same bounded communication as the ADRA.

Abstract: Number games play a central role in alternating normal play combinatorial
game theory due to their real-number-like properties (Conway 1976). Here we
undertake a critical re-examination: we begin with integer and dyadic games and
identify subtle inconsistencies and oversights in the established literature
(e.g. Siegel 2013), most notably, the lack of distinction between a game being
a number and a game being equal to a number. After addressing this, we move to
the general theory of number games. We analyze Conway's original definition and
a later refinement by Siegel, and highlight conceptual gaps that have largely
gone unnoticed. Through a careful dissection of these issues, we propose a more
coherent and robust formulation. Specifically, we develop a refined
characterization of numbers, via several subclasses, dyadics, canonical forms,
their group theoretic closure and zugzwangs, that altogether better capture the
essence of number games. This reconciliation not only clarifies existing
ambiguities but also uncovers several open problems.

Abstract: We formulate a vector cost alternative to the scalarization method for
weighting and combining multi-objective costs. The algorithm produces solutions
to bimatrix games that are simultaneously pure, unique Nash equilibria and
Pareto optimal with guarantees for avoiding worst case outcomes. We achieve
this by enforcing exact potential game constraints to guide cost adjustments
towards equilibrium, while minimizing the deviation from the original cost
structure. The magnitude of this adjustment serves as a metric for
differentiating between Pareto optimal solutions. We implement this approach in
a racing competition between agents with heterogeneous cost structures,
resulting in fewer collision incidents with a minimal decrease in performance.

Abstract: With the increasing integration of smart meters in electrical grids
worldwide, detecting energy theft has become a critical and ongoing challenge.
Artificial intelligence (AI)-based models have demonstrated strong performance
in identifying fraudulent consumption patterns; however, previous works
exploring the use of machine learning solutions for this problem demand high
computational and energy costs, limiting their practicality -- particularly in
low-theft scenarios where continuous inference can result in unnecessary energy
usage. This paper proposes a lightweight detection unit, or watchdog mechanism,
designed to act as a pre-filter that determines when to activate a long
short-term memory (LSTM) model. This mechanism reduces the volume of input fed
to the LSTM model, limiting it to instances that are more likely to involve
energy theft thereby preserving detection accuracy while substantially reducing
energy consumption associated with continuous model execution. The proposed
system was evaluated through simulations across six scenarios with varying
theft severity and number of active thieves. Results indicate a power
consumption reduction exceeding 64\%, with minimal loss in detection accuracy
and consistently high recall. These findings support the feasibility of a more
energy-efficient and scalable approach to energy theft detection in smart
grids. In contrast to prior work that increases model complexity to achieve
marginal accuracy gains, this study emphasizes practical deployment
considerations such as inference efficiency and system scalability. The results
highlight the potential for deploying sustainable, AI-assisted monitoring
systems within modern smart grid infrastructures.

Abstract: Spatial profiling technologies in biology, such as imaging mass cytometry
(IMC) and spatial transcriptomics (ST), generate high-dimensional,
multi-channel data with strong spatial alignment and complex inter-channel
relationships. Generative modeling of such data requires jointly capturing
intra- and inter-channel structure, while also generalizing across arbitrary
combinations of observed and missing channels for practical application.
Existing diffusion-based models generally assume low-dimensional inputs (e.g.,
RGB images) and rely on simple conditioning mechanisms that break spatial
correspondence and ignore inter-channel dependencies. This work proposes a
unified diffusion framework for controllable generation over structured and
spatial biological data. Our model contains two key innovations: (1) a
hierarchical feature injection mechanism that enables multi-resolution
conditioning on spatially aligned channels, and (2) a combination of
latent-space and output-space channel-wise attention to capture inter-channel
relationships. To support flexible conditioning and generalization to arbitrary
subsets of observed channels, we train the model using a random masking
strategy, enabling it to reconstruct missing channels from any combination of
inputs. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across both spatial and
non-spatial prediction tasks, including protein imputation in IMC and
gene-to-protein prediction in single-cell datasets, and show strong

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决食品真实性、标签错误和掺假问题，提供快速、非破坏性的检测方法。

Method: 使用便携式NIRS获取光谱数据，结合PCA和多种ML模型（如LDA、SVM、随机森林等）进行分析和优化。

Result: 随机森林模型表现最佳（ROC AUC 0.8826），SVM次之（0.8747）。NN模型召回率最高（0.7804）。

Conclusion: NIRS与ML结合是检测肉类真实性的可靠方法，对食品欺诈检测有重要贡献。

Abstract: This study evaluates the use of Near-Infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) combined
with advanced machine learning (ML) techniques to differentiate Hanwoo beef
(HNB) and Holstein beef (HLB) to address food authenticity, mislabeling, and
adulteration. Rapid and non-invasive spectral data were attained by a portable
NIRS, recording absorbance data within the wavelength range of 700 to 1100 nm.
A total of 40 Longissimus lumborum samples, evenly split between HNB and HLB,
were obtained from a local hypermarket. Data analysis using Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) demonstrated distinct spectral patterns associated with chemical
changes, clearly separating the two beef varieties and accounting for 93.72% of
the total variance. ML models, including Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA),
Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest, Gradient
Boosting (GB), K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree (DT), Naive Bayes (NB), and
Neural Networks (NN), were implemented, optimized through hyperparameter
tuning, and validated by 5-fold cross-validation techniques to enhance model
robustness and prevent overfitting. Random Forest provided the highest
predictive accuracy with a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Area Under
the Curve (AUC) of 0.8826, closely followed by the SVM model at 0.8747.
Furthermore, GB and NN algorithms exhibited satisfactory performances, with
cross-validation scores of 0.752. Notably, the NN model achieved the highest
recall rate of 0.7804, highlighting its suitability in scenarios requiring
heightened sensitivity. DT and NB exhibited comparatively lower predictive
performance. The LR and SVM models emerged as optimal choices by effectively
balancing high accuracy, precision, and recall. This study confirms that
integrating NIRS with ML techniques offers a powerful and reliable method for
meat authenticity, significantly contributing to detecting food fraud.

Result: 揭示了预训练LSTSMs的优势与局限，明确了其适用场景及小规模模型的竞争力。

Conclusion: 预训练在某些场景下有优势，但简单模型仍具竞争力，需根据任务选择合适方法。

Abstract: Large pre-trained models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
domains, but their effectiveness in time series forecasting remains
understudied. This work empirically examines whether pre-trained large-scale
time series models (LSTSMs) trained on diverse datasets can outperform
traditional non-pretrained small-scale transformers in forecasting tasks. We
analyze state-of-the-art (SOTA) pre-trained universal time series models (e.g.,
Moirai, TimeGPT) alongside conventional transformers, evaluating accuracy,
computational efficiency, and interpretability across multiple benchmarks. Our
findings reveal the strengths and limitations of pre-trained LSTSMs, providing
insights into their suitability for time series tasks compared to task-specific
small-scale architectures. The results highlight scenarios where pretraining
offers advantages and where simpler models remain competitive.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于双曲空间的图融合框架（HKGF），用于分析多模态神经影像数据，以捕捉脑网络的层次结构，并在神经认知衰退预测任务中表现出优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多在欧几里得空间中融合多模态神经影像数据，无法有效捕捉脑网络的层次结构。HKGF旨在通过双曲空间更好地表征脑网络的局部和全局依赖关系。

Method: HKGF包括多模态图构建模块、双曲核图神经网络（HKGNNs）学习模块、跨模态耦合模块和下游预测的双曲神经网络。HKGNNs在双曲空间中编码脑图，保留层次结构。

Result: 在超过4,000名受试者的实验中，HKGF在神经认知衰退预测任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HKGF是一种通用的多模态数据分析框架，可量化与神经认知衰退相关的脑结构/功能连接变化。

Abstract: Multimodal neuroimages, such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and
resting-state functional MRI (fMRI), offer complementary perspectives on brain
activities by capturing structural or functional interactions among brain
regions. While existing studies suggest that fusing these multimodal data helps
detect abnormal brain activity caused by neurocognitive decline, they are
generally implemented in Euclidean space and can't effectively capture
intrinsic hierarchical organization of structural/functional brain networks.
This paper presents a hyperbolic kernel graph fusion (HKGF) framework for
neurocognitive decline analysis with multimodal neuroimages. It consists of a
multimodal graph construction module, a graph representation learning module
that encodes brain graphs in hyperbolic space through a family of hyperbolic
kernel graph neural networks (HKGNNs), a cross-modality coupling module that
enables effective multimodal data fusion, and a hyperbolic neural network for
downstream predictions. Notably, HKGNNs represent graphs in hyperbolic space to
capture both local and global dependencies among brain regions while preserving
the hierarchical structure of brain networks. Extensive experiments involving
over 4,000 subjects with DTI and/or fMRI data suggest the superiority of HKGF
over state-of-the-art methods in two neurocognitive decline prediction tasks.
HKGF is a general framework for multimodal data analysis, facilitating
objective quantification of structural/functional brain connectivity changes
associated with neurocognitive decline.

*Aoming Liu,Reuben Tan,Boqing Gong,Bryan A. Plummer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GSOP是一种数据驱动的方法，通过直接修剪操作而非token来减少VLM的计算冗余，显著提升效率与性能的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM token修剪方法在减少计算时可能误删关键操作，而GSOP旨在精确修剪冗余操作，保留关键计算。

Method: GSOP将VLM解码器计算分解为原子操作，通过贪心排序确定修剪顺序，并利用历史排名和筛选机制提升效率。

Result: GSOP减少70%计算量，仅损失4%性能，且在跨VLM和任务中性能优于现有方法18%。

Conclusion: GSOP通过精确修剪冗余操作，实现了高效与性能的平衡，并在实际GPU评估中验证了其实用性。

Abstract: Prior Vision Language Model (VLM) token pruning reduces computation by
eliminating attention and feed-forward operations for pruned tokens while
maintaining all operations for critical tokens. However, this binary approach
conflates token/operation redundancy - critical operations may be removed along
with discarded tokens, while preserved tokens retain all potentially redundant
operations. To surgically eliminate redundant operations while preserving
critical ones, we propose Greedily Sorted Operation Pruning (GSOP), a
data-driven method that directly prunes operations rather than tokens. GSOP
first decomposes a VLM decoder's computations into atomic operations along
three dimensions: token groups, layer positions, and computation modules. GSOP
determines the pruning order of operations through greedy sorting: GSOP
iteratively selects the redundant operation that incurs minimal performance
drop considering previously pruned operations. Different computational budgets
can be accommodated without re-searching by simply pruning operations according
to this order until the desired budget is met. GSOP enhances sorting efficiency
through: a) leveraging historical operation rankings to avoid redundant
evaluations; b) excluding the ``free-to-prune" and ``danger-to-prune"
operations from sorting. GSOP achieves compelling efficiency-performance
tradeoffs, reducing computation by 70% with only 4% performance loss while
maintaining up to 18% higher performance than state-of-the-art methods when
transferred across diverse VLMs and tasks. Real GPU efficiency evaluations
confirm its practical value. The code is in

TL;DR: CP-DRL是一种基于因果关系的课程强化学习框架，通过任务间因果差异和可学习性优化任务序列设计，显著提升了样本效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 课程强化学习中，设计有效的任务序列是关键挑战。现有方法依赖真实因果结构，不适用于大多数RL场景。

Method: 提出CP-DRL框架，通过交互数据近似任务间因果差异（SCM），结合任务新颖性和奖励增益形成统一目标。

Result: 在Point Mass基准测试中收敛更快、回报更高；在Bipedal Walker-Trivial中方差更小；在Infeasible变体中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 利用任务间因果关系可提升课程强化学习的结构意识和样本效率。

Abstract: Designing effective task sequences is crucial for curriculum reinforcement
learning (CRL), where agents must gradually acquire skills by training on
intermediate tasks. A key challenge in CRL is to identify tasks that promote
exploration, yet are similar enough to support effective transfer. While recent
approach suggests comparing tasks via their Structural Causal Models (SCMs),
the method requires access to ground-truth causal structures, an unrealistic
assumption in most RL settings. In this work, we propose Causal-Paced Deep
Reinforcement Learning (CP-DRL), a curriculum learning framework aware of SCM
differences between tasks based on interaction data approximation. This signal
captures task novelty, which we combine with the agent's learnability, measured
by reward gain, to form a unified objective. Empirically, CP-DRL outperforms
existing curriculum methods on the Point Mass benchmark, achieving faster
convergence and higher returns. CP-DRL demonstrates reduced variance with
comparable final returns in the Bipedal Walker-Trivial setting, and achieves
the highest average performance in the Infeasible variant. These results
indicate that leveraging causal relationships between tasks can improve the
structure-awareness and sample efficiency of curriculum reinforcement learning.
We provide the full implementation of CP-DRL to facilitate the reproduction of
our main results at https://github.com/Cho-Geonwoo/CP-DRL.

Method: 利用HuBERT的自蒸馏机制，直接替换原始模型，使用相同的自监督学习目标训练学生模型。

Result: 在SUPERB上表现优异，音素识别性能提升21%，ASR性能提升14%，多任务表现竞争力强。

Conclusion: DiceHuBERT在性能和多任务适应性上具有明显优势，是一种高效的蒸馏方法。

Abstract: We introduce DiceHuBERT, a knowledge distillation framework for compressing
HuBERT, a widely used self-supervised learning (SSL)-based speech foundation
model. Unlike existing distillation methods that rely on layer-wise and
feature-wise mapping between teacher and student models, DiceHuBERT leverages
HuBERT's iterative self-distillation mechanism by directly replacing the
original model with a student model. This replacement allows the student to be
trained using the same SSL objective used when pre-training HuBERT, eliminating
the need for additional modules or architectural constraints. Experimental
results on SUPERB show that DiceHuBERT consistently outperforms existing
distillation methods, improving phoneme recognition performance by over 21% and
ASR performance by more than 14%. Furthermore, DiceHuBERT demonstrates
competitive performance across multiple tasks, highlighting its clear
advantage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多因素问题中的结构复杂性和多重共线性，特别是在碳排放分析中，需要一种既能客观聚类特征又能高效选择特征的框架。

Method: 使用DBSCAN进行无监督学习聚类特征，结合弹性网络回归进行高维特征选择和复杂度控制。弹性网络通过结合L1和L2惩罚项，适用于相关预测变量的数据集。

Result: 应用于中国46个行业2000-2019年的能源消费数据，识别出16个类别，并定量评估了每个类别的排放特征和驱动因素。

Conclusion: 该框架具有全球适用性，能有效识别主要排放源并提供可操作见解，同时指出人类认为有意义的定性特征可能对模型不准确。

Abstract: This study proposes an analytical framework that integrates DBSCAN clustering
with the Elastic Net regression model to address multifactorial problems
characterized by structural complexity and multicollinearity, exemplified by
carbon emissions analysis. DBSCAN is employed for unsupervised learning to
objectively cluster features, while the Elastic Net is utilized for
high-dimensional feature selection and complexity control. The Elastic Net is
specifically chosen for its ability to balance feature selection and
regularization by combining L1 (lasso) and L2 (ridge) penalties, making it
particularly suited for datasets with correlated predictors. Applying this
framework to energy consumption data from 46 industries in China (2000-2019)
resulted in the identification of 16 categories. Emission characteristics and
drivers were quantitatively assessed for each category, demonstrating the
framework's capacity to identify primary emission sources and provide
actionable insights. This research underscores the global applicability of the
framework for analyzing complex regional challenges, such as carbon emissions,
and highlights qualitative features that humans find meaningful may not be
accurate for the model.

Motivation: 现有BNN分析方法在可扩展性或可靠性上存在不足，限制了其在实际安全关键应用中的适用性。

Result: 实验显示，定性验证速度提升9倍，定量验证速度提升218倍，覆盖率分别达到99%和86%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了BNN验证的可扩展性和可信赖性，优于现有基线。

Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as essential components in safety-critical
applications -- these use cases demand complex, yet trustworthy computations.
Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) are a type of neural network where each neuron
is constrained to a Boolean value; they are particularly well-suited for
safety-critical tasks because they retain much of the computational capacities
of full-scale (floating-point or quantized) deep neural networks, but remain
compatible with satisfiability solvers for qualitative verification and with
model counters for quantitative reasoning. However, existing methods for BNN
analysis suffer from either limited scalability or susceptibility to soundness
errors, which hinders their applicability in real-world scenarios.
  In this work, we present a scalable and trustworthy approach for both
qualitative and quantitative verification of BNNs. Our approach introduces a
native representation of BNN constraints in a custom-designed solver for
qualitative reasoning, and in an approximate model counter for quantitative
reasoning. We further develop specialized proof generation and checking
pipelines with native support for BNN constraint reasoning, ensuring
trustworthiness for all of our verification results. Empirical evaluations on a
BNN robustness verification benchmark suite demonstrate that our certified
solving approach achieves a $9\times$ speedup over prior certified CNF and
PB-based approaches, and our certified counting approach achieves a $218\times$
speedup over the existing CNF-based baseline. In terms of coverage, our
pipeline produces fully certified results for $99\%$ and $86\%$ of the
qualitative and quantitative reasoning queries on BNNs, respectively. This is
in sharp contrast to the best existing baselines which can fully certify only
$62\%$ and $4\%$ of the queries, respectively.

TL;DR: Echo State Transformers (EST) 是一种结合 Transformer 注意力机制和 Reservoir Computing 的混合架构，解决了标准 Transformer 的二次复杂度问题，并在低数据场景中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准 Transformer 在处理序列数据时存在二次复杂度问题，且与大脑处理认知任务的方式不符。EST 旨在开发更高效、计算需求更低的模型。

Method: EST 结合 Transformer 注意力机制和 Reservoir Computing，引入基于多个并行随机循环网络的“工作记忆”模块，动态调整记忆/非线性权衡。

Result: 在 STREAM 基准测试中，EST 在 12 个任务中的 8 个上优于 GRU、LSTM 和 Transformer。

Conclusion: EST 是 GRU 和 LSTM 的有效替代方案，并在资源受限和低数据场景中补充标准 Transformer。

Abstract: While Large Language Models and their underlying Transformer architecture are
remarkably efficient, they do not reflect how our brain processes and learns a
diversity of cognitive tasks such as language and working memory. Furthermore,
sequential data processing with Transformers encounters a fundamental barrier:
quadratic complexity growth with sequence length. Motivated by these
limitations, our ambition is to create more efficient models that are less
reliant on intensive computations and massive volumes of data. We introduce
Echo State Transformers (EST), a hybrid architecture that elegantly resolves
this challenge while demonstrating exceptional performance in low-data regimes.
EST integrates the Transformer attention mechanisms with principles from
Reservoir Computing to create a fixedsize window distributed memory system.
Drawing inspiration from Echo State Networks, the most prominent instance of
the Reservoir Computing paradigm, our architecture integrates a new module
called ''Working Memory'' based on several reservoirs (i.e. random recurrent
networks) working in parallel. These reservoirs work as independent memory
units with distinct internal dynamics. A novelty here is that the classical
reservoir hyperparameters controlling the dynamics are now trained. Thus, the
EST dynamically adapts the memory/non-linearity trade-off in reservoirs. By
maintaining a fixed number of memory units regardless of sequence length, EST
achieves constant computational complexity at each processing step, effectively
breaking the quadratic scaling problem of standard Transformers. Evaluations on
the STREAM benchmark, which comprises 12 diverse sequential processing tasks,
demonstrate that EST outperforms GRUs, LSTMs, and even Transformers on 8 of
these tasks. These findings highlight that Echo State Transformers can be an
effective replacement to GRUs and LSTMs while complementing standard
Transformers at least on resource-constrained environments and low-data
scenarios across diverse sequential processing tasks.

Abstract: Spatial structure is central to effective geospatial intelligence systems.
While foundation models have shown promise, they often lack the flexibility to
reason about places, which are context-rich regions spanning different spatial
granularities. We propose PlaceFM, a spatial foundation model that captures
place representations using a training-free graph condensation method. PlaceFM
condenses a nationwide POI graph built from integrated Foursquare and
OpenStreetMap data in the U.S., generating general-purpose embeddings of
places. These embeddings can be seamlessly integrated into geolocation data
pipelines to support a wide range of downstream tasks. Without requiring
pretraining, PlaceFM offers a scalable and adaptable solution for multi-scale

Abstract: In the era of Industry 5.0, data-driven decision-making has become
indispensable for optimizing systems across Industrial Engineering. This paper
addresses the value of big data analytics by proposing a novel non-linear
hybrid approach for forecasting international tourist arrivals in two different
contexts: (i) arrivals to Hong Kong from five major source nations
(pre-COVID-19), and (ii) arrivals to Sanya in Hainan province, China
(post-COVID-19). The method integrates multiple sources of Internet big data
and employs an innovative game theory-based algorithm to identify opinion
leaders on social media platforms. Subsequently, nonstationary attributes in
tourism demand data are managed through Empirical Wavelet Transform (EWT),
ensuring refined time-frequency analysis. Finally, a memory-aware Stacked
Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Stacked BiLSTM) network is used to
generate accurate demand forecasts. Experimental results demonstrate that this
approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques and remains robust
under dynamic and volatile conditions, highlighting its applicability to
broader Industrial Engineering domains, such as logistics, supply chain
management, and production planning, where forecasting and resource allocation
are key challenges. By merging advanced Deep Learning (DL), time-frequency
analysis, and social media insights, the proposed framework showcases how
large-scale data can elevate the quality and efficiency of decision-making
processes.

Abstract: Machine learning enables the extraction of useful information from large,

train machine learning models. We develop and demonstrate a method, called the
Conceptual Modeling for Machine Learning (CMML), which is comprised of
guidelines for data preparation in machine learning and based on conceptual
modeling constructs and principles. To assess the impact of CMML on machine
learning outcomes, we first applied it to two real-world problems to evaluate
its impact on model performance. We then solicited an assessment by data
scientists on the applicability of the method. These results demonstrate the
value of CMML for improving machine learning outcomes.

Result: 在针对BCL-2的案例中，框架提升了分子多样性和优化效果，并通过Boltz-2生成3D蛋白-配体复合物。

Conclusion: 该框架为AI辅助药物发现提供了可扩展的基础，支持分子筛选和优先排序。

Abstract: We present a modular framework powered by large language models (LLMs) that
automates and streamlines key tasks across the early-stage computational drug
discovery pipeline. By combining LLM reasoning with domain-specific tools, the
framework performs biomedical data retrieval, domain-specific question
answering, molecular generation, property prediction, property-aware molecular
refinement, and 3D protein-ligand structure generation. In a case study
targeting BCL-2 in lymphocytic leukemia, the agent autonomously retrieved
relevant biomolecular information-including FASTA sequences, SMILES
representations, and literature-and answered mechanistic questions with
improved contextual accuracy over standard LLMs. It then generated chemically
diverse seed molecules and predicted 67 ADMET-related properties, which guided
iterative molecular refinement. Across two refinement rounds, the number of
molecules with QED > 0.6 increased from 34 to 55, and those passing at least
four out of five empirical drug-likeness rules rose from 29 to 52, within a
pool of 194 molecules. The framework also employed Boltz-2 to generate 3D
protein-ligand complexes and provide rapid binding affinity estimates for
candidate compounds. These results demonstrate that the approach effectively
supports molecular screening, prioritization, and structure evaluation. Its
modular design enables flexible integration of evolving tools and models,
providing a scalable foundation for AI-assisted therapeutic discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有分子预训练模型难以捕捉专家隐性推理的问题。

Method: 利用ChatGPT模拟化学家推理，生成知识表示，并通过门控交叉注意力机制与分子图特征融合。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上表现优于SOTA模型，如FreeSolv的RMSE降低15.0%，BACE的AUROC提升5.39%。

Conclusion: MolProphecy提供了一种灵活且可推广的药物发现协作方法，支持真实化学家输入且无需重新训练模型。

Abstract: MolProphecy is a human-in-the-loop (HITL) multi-modal framework designed to
integrate chemists' domain knowledge into molecular property prediction models.
While molecular pre-trained models have enabled significant gains in predictive
accuracy, they often fail to capture the tacit, interpretive reasoning central
to expert-driven molecular design. To address this, MolProphecy employs ChatGPT
as a virtual chemist to simulate expert-level reasoning and decision-making.
The generated chemist knowledge is embedded by the large language model (LLM)
as a dedicated knowledge representation and then fused with graph-based
molecular features through a gated cross-attention mechanism, enabling joint
reasoning over human-derived and structural features. Evaluated on four
benchmark datasets (FreeSolv, BACE, SIDER, and ClinTox), MolProphecy
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, achieving a 15.0 percent reduction
in RMSE on FreeSolv and a 5.39 percent improvement in AUROC on BACE. Analysis
reveals that chemist knowledge and structural features provide complementary
contributions, improving both accuracy and interpretability. MolProphecy offers
a practical and generalizable approach for collaborative drug discovery, with
the flexibility to incorporate real chemist input in place of the current
simulated proxy--without the need for model retraining. The implementation is
publicly available at https://github.com/zhangruochi/MolProphecy.

environments has placed a growing emphasis on operational efficiency and
customer satisfaction. Traditional maintenance approaches either reactive or
time-based preventive are limited in their ability to preempt machine failures,
leading to unplanned downtimes and elevated service costs. This research
presents a novel predictive maintenance framework tailored for vending machines
by leveraging Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and machine learning (ML)
algorithms. The proposed system continuously monitors machine components and
operating conditions in real time and applies predictive models to forecast
failures before they occur. This enables timely maintenance scheduling,
minimizing downtime and extending machine lifespan. The framework was validated
through simulated fault data and performance evaluation using classification
algorithms. Results show a significant improvement in early fault detection and
a reduction in redundant service interventions. The findings indicate that
predictive maintenance systems, when integrated into vending infrastructure,
can transform operational efficiency and service reliability.

TL;DR: 现代大型语言模型（LLM）能够理解和回答关于结构化数据（如图）的问题。本文提出了一种基于Fock空间表示的无参数图编码器，简化了现有解决方案，并能泛化到多种图结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在结构化数据（如图）上的能力，减少监督需求并提供泛化能力。

Method: 使用基于Fock空间表示的无参数图编码器，结合预训练的LLM，回答图相关问题。

Result: 该方法在多种图结构（如简单图、蛋白质、超图）上表现优异，且无需调整架构。

Conclusion: 提出的方法简化了现有解决方案，并能轻松泛化到不同图结构。

Abstract: Recent results show that modern Large Language Models (LLM) are indeed
capable of understanding and answering questions about structured data such as
graphs. This new paradigm can lead to solutions that require less supervision
while, at the same time, providing a model that can generalize and answer
questions beyond the training labels. Existing proposals often use some
description of the graph to create an ``augmented'' prompt fed to the LLM. For
a chosen class of graphs, if a well-tailored graph encoder is deployed to play
together with a pre-trained LLM, the model can answer graph-related questions
well. Existing solutions to graph-based prompts range from graph serialization
to graph transformers. In this work, we show that the use of a parameter-free
graph encoder based on Fock space representations, a concept borrowed from
mathematical physics, is remarkably versatile in this problem setting. The
simple construction, inherited directly from the theory with a few small
adjustments, can provide rich and informative graph encodings, for a wide range
of different graphs. We investigate the use of this idea for prefix-tuned
prompts leveraging the capabilities of a pre-trained, frozen LLM. The
modifications lead to a model that can answer graph-related questions -- from
simple graphs to proteins to hypergraphs -- effectively and with minimal, if
any, adjustments to the architecture. Our work significantly simplifies
existing solutions and generalizes well to multiple different graph-based
structures effortlessly.

Result: 在Navier-Stokes方程数据集上，MSE和MAE分别降低了81.3%和52.3%。

Conclusion: SDKD框架有效捕捉高频变化和长期趋势，同时降低计算复杂度。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal forecasting tasks, such as traffic flow, combustion dynamics,
and weather forecasting, often require complex models that suffer from low
training efficiency and high memory consumption. This paper proposes a
lightweight framework, Spectral Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (termed SDKD),
which transfers the multi-scale spatiotemporal representations from a complex
teacher model to a more efficient lightweight student network. The teacher
model follows an encoder-latent evolution-decoder architecture, where its
latent evolution module decouples high-frequency details and low-frequency
trends using convolution and Transformer (global low-frequency modeler).
However, the multi-layer convolution and deconvolution structures result in
slow training and high memory usage. To address these issues, we propose a
frequency-aligned knowledge distillation strategy, which extracts multi-scale
spectral features from the teacher's latent space, including both high and low
frequency components, to guide the lightweight student model in capturing both
local fine-grained variations and global evolution patterns. Experimental
results show that SDKD significantly improves performance, achieving reductions
of up to 81.3% in MSE and in MAE 52.3% on the Navier-Stokes equation dataset.
The framework effectively captures both high-frequency variations and long-term
trends while reducing computational complexity. Our codes are available at

Result: 多注意力头在特定多样性条件下能协同增强信息传播，提升混合时间和极小极大保真度。

Conclusion: 实验验证多注意力头机制在相同参数下优于单头机制，支持理论分析。

Abstract: Multi-head attention powers Transformer networks, the primary deep learning
architecture behind the success of large language models (LLMs). Yet, the
theoretical advantages of multi-head versus single-head attention, beyond mere
parallel processing, remain underexplored. In this paper, we reframe multi-head
attention as a system of potentially synergistic computational graphs, where
each head functions as a feedforward directed acyclic graph (DAG) with a common
sink state. We provide intuition and preliminary theoretical analysis of mixing
time and minimax fidelity in this framework. Our results show that multi-head
attention can synergistically enhance information propagation, yielding faster
mixing times and minimax fidelity amplification under specific head-diversity
conditions. Finally, we train single-head and multi-head Transformers, each
with the same total number of parameters, on sequence manipulation tasks and
empirically verify the predicted effects.

Motivation: 解决在LLM生成文本中安全整合私有信息的开放性问题。

Method: 通过隔离和裁剪敏感信息，以及从私有令牌的小超集中采样，实现差分隐私。

Result: 计算成本降低8倍，生成的长文本质量与非私有生成相当。

Conclusion: InvisibleInk能以低于非私有生成10倍的计算成本生成私有长文本。

Abstract: As major progress in LLM-based long-form text generation enables paradigms
such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and inference-time scaling, safely
incorporating private information into the generation remains a critical open
question. We present InvisibleInk, a highly scalable long-form text generation
framework satisfying rigorous differential privacy guarantees with respect to
the sensitive references. It interprets sampling from the LLM's
next-token-distribution as the exponential mechanism over the LLM logits with
two innovations. First, we reduce the privacy cost by isolating and clipping
only the sensitive information in the model logits (relative to the public
logits). Second, we improve text quality by sampling from a small superset of
the top-$k$ private tokens. Empirical evaluations demonstrate a consistent
$8\times$ reduction in computation cost over state-of-the-art baselines to
generate long-form private text of the same utility across privacy levels. In
summary, InvisibleInk is able to generate private long-form text at less than
$10\times$ the computation cost of non-private generation.

Abstract: The growing use of large language models (LLMs) for biomedical question
answering raises concerns about the accuracy and evidentiary support of their
responses. To address this, we present Answered with Evidence, a framework for
evaluating whether LLM-generated answers are grounded in scientific literature.
We analyzed thousands of physician-submitted questions using a comparative
pipeline that included: (1) Alexandria, fka the Atropos Evidence Library, a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system based on novel observational
studies, and (2) two PubMed-based retrieval-augmented systems (System and
Perplexity). We found that PubMed-based systems provided evidence-supported
answers for approximately 44% of questions, while the novel evidence source did
so for about 50%. Combined, these sources enabled reliable answers to over 70%
of biomedical queries. As LLMs become increasingly capable of summarizing
scientific content, maximizing their value will require systems that can
accurately retrieve both published and custom-generated evidence or generate
such evidence in real time.

Abstract: Multi-material 3D printing, particularly through polymer jetting, enables the
fabrication of digital materials by mixing distinct photopolymers at the micron
scale within a single build to create a composite with tunable mechanical
properties. This work presents an integrated experimental and computational
investigation into the composition-dependent mechanical behavior of 3D printed
digital materials. We experimentally characterize five formulations, combining
soft and rigid UV-cured polymers under uniaxial tension and torsion across
three strain and twist rates. The results reveal nonlinear and rate-dependent
responses that strongly depend on composition. To model this behavior, we
develop a physics-augmented neural network (PANN) that combines a partially
input convex neural network (pICNN) for learning the composition-dependent
hyperelastic strain energy function with a quasi-linear viscoelastic (QLV)
formulation for time-dependent response. The pICNN ensures convexity with
respect to strain invariants while allowing non-convex dependence on
composition. To enhance interpretability, we apply $L_0$ sparsification. For
the time-dependent response, we introduce a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to
predict viscoelastic relaxation parameters from composition. The proposed model
accurately captures the nonlinear, rate-dependent behavior of 3D printed
digital materials in both uniaxial tension and torsion, achieving high
predictive accuracy for interpolated material compositions. This approach
provides a scalable framework for automated, composition-aware constitutive
model discovery for multi-material 3D printing.

Abstract: Medical Image Grounding (MIG), which involves localizing specific regions in
medical images based on textual descriptions, requires models to not only
perceive regions but also deduce spatial relationships of these regions.
Existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for MIG often rely on Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) with large amounts of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning
annotations, which are expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Recently,
DeepSeek-R1 demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) can acquire
reasoning abilities through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) without
requiring CoT annotations. In this paper, we adapt the GRPO reinforcement
learning framework to VLMs for Medical Image Grounding. We propose the
Spatial-Semantic Rewarded Group Relative Policy Optimization to train the model
without CoT reasoning annotations. Specifically, we introduce Spatial-Semantic
Rewards, which combine spatial accuracy reward and semantic consistency reward
to provide nuanced feedback for both spatially positive and negative
completions. Additionally, we propose to use the Chain-of-Box template, which
integrates visual information of referring bounding boxes into the <think>
reasoning process, enabling the model to explicitly reason about spatial
regions during intermediate steps. Experiments on three datasets MS-CXR,
ChestX-ray8, and M3D-RefSeg demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in Medical Image Grounding. Ablation studies
further validate the effectiveness of each component in our approach. Code,
checkpoints, and datasets are available at

Abstract: Learning to perform activities through demonstration requires extracting
meaningful information about the environment from observations. In this
research, we investigate the challenge of planning high-level goal-oriented
actions in a simulation setting from an egocentric perspective. We present a
novel task, interactive action planning, and propose an approach that combines
topological affordance memory with transformer architecture. The process of
memorizing the environment's structure through extracting affordances
facilitates selecting appropriate actions based on the context. Moreover, the
memory model allows us to detect action deviations while accomplishing specific
objectives. To assess the method's versatility, we evaluate it in a realistic
interactive simulation environment. Our experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approach learns meaningful representations, resulting in improved
performance and robust when action deviations occur.

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展罕见病患者的识别和分层，适用于临床和研究。

Abstract: Rare diseases affect an estimated 300-400 million people worldwide, yet
individual conditions often remain poorly characterized and difficult to
diagnose due to their low prevalence and limited clinician familiarity. While
computational phenotyping algorithms show promise for automating rare disease
detection, their development is hindered by the scarcity of labeled data and
biases in existing label sources. Gold-standard labels from registries and
expert chart reviews are highly accurate but constrained by selection bias and
the cost of manual review. In contrast, labels derived from electronic health
records (EHRs) cover a broader range of patients but can introduce substantial
noise. To address these challenges, we propose a weakly supervised,
transformer-based framework that combines a small set of gold-standard labels
with a large volume of iteratively updated silver-standard labels derived from
EHR data. This hybrid approach enables the training of a highly accurate and
generalizable phenotyping model that scales rare disease detection beyond the
scope of individual clinical expertise. Our method is initialized by learning
embeddings of medical concepts based on their semantic meaning or co-occurrence
patterns in EHRs, which are then refined and aggregated into patient-level
representations via a multi-layer transformer architecture. Using two rare
pulmonary diseases as a case study, we validate our model on EHR data from
Boston Children's Hospital. Our framework demonstrates notable improvements in
phenotype classification, identification of clinically meaningful subphenotypes
through patient clustering, and prediction of disease progression compared to
baseline methods. These results highlight the potential of our approach to
enable scalable identification and stratification of rare disease patients for
clinical care and research applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统FxLMS在主动噪声控制中需要优化高维滤波器权重，计算复杂度高。利用噪声源或控制源的空间区域先验知识，可以将其约束在低维流形上，提高效率。

Method: 训练自编码器对稳态自适应滤波器权重进行编码和解码，将滤波器权重约束为解码器输出，并在潜在空间进行更新。

Result: 在特定条件下，Latent FxLMS比标准FxLMS收敛更快，且稳态均方误差相当。

Conclusion: 通过低维流形约束自适应滤波器权重，Latent FxLMS在保持性能的同时提升了收敛速度。

Abstract: Filtered-X LMS (FxLMS) is commonly used for active noise control (ANC),
wherein the soundfield is minimized at a desired location. Given prior
knowledge of the spatial region of the noise or control sources, we could
improve FxLMS by adapting along the low-dimensional manifold of possible
adaptive filter weights. We train an auto-encoder on the filter coefficients of
the steady-state adaptive filter for each primary source location sampled from
a given spatial region and constrain the weights of the adaptive filter to be
the output of the decoder for a given state of latent variables. Then, we
perform updates in the latent space and use the decoder to generate the
cancellation filter. We evaluate how various neural network constraints and
normalization techniques impact the convergence speed and steady-state mean
squared error. Under certain conditions, our Latent FxLMS model converges in
fewer steps with comparable steady-state error to the standard FxLMS.

Conclusion: 该框架揭示了内在几何如何影响学习能力，为结构化数据上的深度学习提供了理论和实践指导。

Abstract: In this work, we develop new generalization bounds for neural networks
trained on data supported on Riemannian manifolds. Existing generalization
theories often rely on complexity measures derived from Euclidean geometry,
which fail to account for the intrinsic structure of non-Euclidean spaces. Our
analysis introduces a geometric refinement: we derive covering number bounds
that explicitly incorporate manifold-specific properties such as sectional
curvature, volume growth, and injectivity radius. These geometric corrections
lead to sharper Rademacher complexity bounds for classes of Lipschitz neural
networks defined on compact manifolds. The resulting generalization guarantees
recover standard Euclidean results when curvature is zero but improve
substantially in settings where the data lies on curved, low-dimensional
manifolds embedded in high-dimensional ambient spaces. We illustrate the
tightness of our bounds in negatively curved spaces, where the exponential
volume growth leads to provably higher complexity, and in positively curved
spaces, where the curvature acts as a regularizing factor. This framework
provides a principled understanding of how intrinsic geometry affects learning
capacity, offering both theoretical insight and practical implications for deep
learning on structured data domains.

measurements, and by leveraging a machine learning formulation, our approach
will improve upon prior state-of-the-art results. Our results demonstrate that
the new tensor-based method more accurately reflects the original data
distribution and effectively captures organ-specific variability. The proposed
tensor-based methodology achieved lower mean squared errors and mean absolute
errors compared to both conventional Canonical Polyadic decomposition and
2-dimensional matrix factorization methods. In addition, our non-negative
tensor completion implementation reveals relationships among tissues. Our
findings not only complete the world's largest in-vivo toxicogenomics database

Abstract: Transfer learning in Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables agents to leverage
knowledge from source tasks to accelerate learning in target tasks. While prior
work, such as the Attend, Adapt, and Transfer (A2T) framework, addresses
negative transfer and selective transfer, other critical challenges remain
underexplored. This paper introduces the Generalized Adaptive Transfer Network
(GATN), a deep RL architecture designed to tackle task generalization across
domains, robustness to environmental changes, and computational efficiency in
transfer. GATN employs a domain-agnostic representation module, a
robustness-aware policy adapter, and an efficient transfer scheduler to achieve
these goals. We evaluate GATN on diverse benchmarks, including Atari 2600,
MuJoCo, and a custom chatbot dialogue environment, demonstrating superior
performance in cross-domain generalization, resilience to dynamic environments,
and reduced computational overhead compared to baselines. Our findings suggest
GATN is a versatile framework for real-world RL applications, such as adaptive
chatbots and robotic control.

highest predictive accuracy, reflecting stable demand patterns, while Dubai and
Bangkok demonstrated higher variability due to seasonal and event-driven
influences. The findings validate the effectiveness of LSTM models for urban

Motivation: 探讨通用逼近定理（UAT）系统在数学上的根本限制，揭示其无法避免的灾难性故障。

Method: 通过组合必要性、拓扑必要性和经验必要性三个层面的论证，证明任何通用逼近器都无法避免不稳定性。

Result: 完美对齐是数学上不可能的，系统必须在不可控性存在的情况下安全运行。

Conclusion: UAT安全性的问题应从追求完美控制转向如何在不可控性下安全操作。

Abstract: We establish fundamental mathematical limits on universal approximation
theorem (UAT) system alignment by proving that catastrophic failures are an
inescapable feature of any useful computational system. Our central thesis is
that for any universal approximator, the expressive power required for useful
computation is inextricably linked to a dense set of instabilities that make
perfect, reliable control a mathematical impossibility. We prove this through a
three-level argument that leaves no escape routes for any class of universal
approximator architecture. i) Combinatorial Necessity: For the vast majority of
practical universal approximators (e.g., those using ReLU activations), we
prove that the density of catastrophic failure points is directly proportional
to the network's expressive power. ii) Topological Necessity: For any
theoretical universal approximator, we use singularity theory to prove that the
ability to approximate generic functions requires the ability to implement the
dense, catastrophic singularities that characterize them. iii) Empirical
Necessity: We prove that the universal existence of adversarial examples is
empirical evidence that real-world tasks are themselves catastrophic, forcing
any successful model to learn and replicate these instabilities. These results,
combined with a quantitative "Impossibility Sandwich" showing that the minimum
complexity for usefulness exceeds the maximum complexity for safety,
demonstrate that perfect alignment is not an engineering challenge but a
mathematical impossibility. This foundational result reframes UAT safety from a
problem of "how to achieve perfect control" to one of "how to operate safely in
the presence of irreducible uncontrollability," with profound implications for

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种四层分类法，以解决生成式AI时代数据保护的不足，涵盖不可用性、隐私保护、可追溯性和可删除性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据保护方法在生成式AI时代已显不足，亟需明确界定保护范围并加强执行。

Method: 提出四层分类法，分析每层的技术方法并揭示监管盲点。

Result: 框架为开发者、研究者和监管者提供了数据保护的结构化视角。

Conclusion: 需重新思考现代AI技术的数据保护，以指导未来技术和治理。

Abstract: The (generative) artificial intelligence (AI) era has profoundly reshaped the
meaning and value of data. No longer confined to static content, data now
permeates every stage of the AI lifecycle from the training samples that shape
model parameters to the prompts and outputs that drive real-world model
deployment. This shift renders traditional notions of data protection
insufficient, while the boundaries of what needs safeguarding remain poorly
defined. Failing to safeguard data in AI systems can inflict societal and
individual, underscoring the urgent need to clearly delineate the scope of and
rigorously enforce data protection. In this perspective, we propose a
four-level taxonomy, including non-usability, privacy preservation,
traceability, and deletability, that captures the diverse protection needs
arising in modern (generative) AI models and systems. Our framework offers a
structured understanding of the trade-offs between data utility and control,
spanning the entire AI pipeline, including training datasets, model weights,
system prompts, and AI-generated content. We analyze representative technical
approaches at each level and reveal regulatory blind spots that leave critical
assets exposed. By offering a structured lens to align future AI technologies
and governance with trustworthy data practices, we underscore the urgency of
rethinking data protection for modern AI techniques and provide timely guidance
for developers, researchers, and regulators alike.

### [431] [Adaptive Cubic Regularized Second-Order Latent Factor Analysis Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03036)
*Jialiang Wang,Junzhou Wang,Xin Liao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ACRSLF的自适应立方正则化二阶潜在因子分析模型，用于高效处理高维不完整数据，解决了传统方法的非凸优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维不完整数据（HDI）在现实应用中广泛存在，传统二阶潜在因子模型因目标函数的双线性和非凸性导致优化困难。

Method: ACRSLF采用自适应立方正则化和多Hessian-向量乘积评估，动态缓解非凸优化不稳定并精确吸收二阶信息。

Result: 在两个工业HDI数据集上的实验表明，ACRSLF收敛更快且表示精度高于现有优化器驱动的LFA模型。

Conclusion: ACRSLF通过创新优化策略显著提升了高维不完整数据的建模效率和精度。

Abstract: High-dimensional and incomplete (HDI) data, characterized by massive node
interactions, have become ubiquitous across various real-world applications.
Second-order latent factor models have shown promising performance in modeling
this type of data. Nevertheless, due to the bilinear and non-convex nature of
the SLF model's objective function, incorporating a damping term into the
Hessian approximation and carefully tuning associated parameters become
essential. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new approach in this
study, named the adaptive cubic regularized second-order latent factor analysis
(ACRSLF) model. The proposed ACRSLF adopts the two-fold ideas: 1) self-tuning
cubic regularization that dynamically mitigates non-convex optimization
instabilities; 2) multi-Hessian-vector product evaluation during conjugate
gradient iterations for precise second-order information assimilation.
Comprehensive experiments on two industrial HDI datasets demonstrate that the
ACRSLF converges faster and achieves higher representation accuracy than the
advancing optimizer-based LFA models.

TL;DR: Optimas是一个统一框架，用于优化复合AI系统，通过局部奖励函数（LRF）实现组件独立优化，提升全局性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复合AI系统（如结合大型语言模型和传统机器学习模型）的优化因非可微结构和多样化配置而具有挑战性。

Method: Optimas为每个组件维护一个局部奖励函数（LRF），确保局部奖励与全局性能对齐，并独立优化各组件配置。

Result: 在五个实际复合系统中，Optimas平均性能提升11.92%，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Optimas提供了一种通用且有效的方法，显著提升了复合系统的性能。

Abstract: Compound AI systems integrating multiple components, such as Large Language
Models, specialized tools, and traditional machine learning models, are
increasingly deployed to solve complex real-world tasks. However, optimizing
compound systems remains challenging due to their non-differentiable structures
and diverse configuration types across components, including prompts,
hyperparameters, and model parameters. To address this challenge, we propose
Optimas, a unified framework for effective optimization of compound systems.
The core idea of Optimas is to maintain one Local Reward Function (LRF) per
component, each satisfying a local-global alignment property, i.e., each
component's local reward correlates with the global system performance. In each
iteration, Optimas efficiently adapts the LRFs to maintain this property while
simultaneously maximizing each component's local reward. This approach enables
independent updates of heterogeneous configurations using the designated
optimization method, while ensuring that local improvements consistently lead
to performance gains. We present extensive evaluations across five real-world
compound systems to demonstrate that Optimas outperforms strong baselines by an
average improvement of 11.92%, offering a general and effective approach for
improving compound systems. Our website is at https://optimas.stanford.edu.

Motivation: 揭示优化方法在解决人工通用智能问题中的根本缺陷，尤其是灾难性遗忘和过拟合问题。

Method: 通过形式化证明和实证分析，比较优化方法与世界建模方法的性能。

Result: 优化方法存在固有缺陷，无法实现人工认知；世界建模方法能避免这些问题。

Conclusion: 人工智能领域需超越机器学习，寻找其他方法以实现人工认知。

Abstract: The Artificial Intelligence field has focused on developing optimisation
methods to solve multiple problems, specifically problems that we thought to be
only solvable through cognition. The obtained results have been outstanding,
being able to even surpass the Turing Test. However, we have found that these
optimisation methods share some fundamental flaws that impede them to become a
true artificial cognition. Specifically, the field have identified catastrophic
forgetting as a fundamental problem to develop such cognition. This paper
formally proves that this problem is inherent to optimisation methods, and as
such it will always limit approaches that try to solve the Artificial General
Intelligence problem as an optimisation problem. Additionally, it addresses the
problem of overfitting and discuss about other smaller problems that
optimisation methods pose. Finally, it empirically shows how world-modelling
methods avoid suffering from either problem. As a conclusion, the field of
Artificial Intelligence needs to look outside the machine learning field to
find methods capable of developing an artificial cognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习系统在人类决策中广泛应用，确保其公平性（不基于敏感属性偏袒个体）至关重要。

Method: 引入了一种规范语言描述公平性属性，并构建监控器实时评估系统公平性，提供定量估计。

Result: 监控算法在实验中表现高效，每次观察后更新判决时间不足1毫秒。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效监控系统公平性，适用于多种实际场景，如银行贷款和大学录取。

Abstract: Machine-learned systems are in widespread use for making decisions about
humans, and it is important that they are fair, i.e., not biased against
individuals based on sensitive attributes.
  We present a general framework of runtime verification of algorithmic
fairness for systems whose models are unknown, but are assumed to have a Markov
chain structure, with or without full observation of the state space.
  We introduce a specification language that can model many common algorithmic
fairness properties, such as demographic parity, equal opportunity, and social
burden.
  We build monitors that observe a long sequence of events as generated by a
given system, and output, after each observation, a quantitative estimate of
how fair or biased the system was on that run until that point in time.
  The estimate is proven to be correct modulo a variable error bound and a
given confidence level, where the error bound gets tighter as the observed
sequence gets longer.
  We present two categories of monitoring algorithms, namely ones with a
uniform error bound across all time points, and ones with weaker non-uniform,
pointwise error bounds at different time points.
  Our monitoring algorithms use statistical tools that are adapted to suit the
dynamic requirements of monitoring and the special needs of the fairness
specifications.
  Using a prototype implementation, we show how we can monitor if a bank is
fair in giving loans to applicants from different social backgrounds, and if a
college is fair in admitting students while maintaining a reasonable financial
burden on the society.
  In these experiments, our monitors took less than a millisecond to update
their verdicts after each observation.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了8:16半结构化稀疏方法，在保持性能的同时超越性能阈值，相比2:4稀疏更具灵活性，且存储开销更小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型规模增大，高效的压缩技术（如量化和稀疏化）变得至关重要。结构化稀疏方法（如N:M稀疏）因灵活性不足和对异常权重的敏感性而表现不佳。

Method: 研究采用8:16半结构化稀疏方法，结合稀疏结构化模式处理显著权重，并使用方差校正和类似SmoothQuant的权重均衡技术。

Result: 8:16稀疏方法在性能上超越阈值，存储开销更小（0.875 vs. 0.75 bits/element），且结构化稀疏对异常权重的处理与无结构化方法竞争或更优。

Conclusion: 8:16半结构化稀疏是一种高效且灵活的压缩技术，结合简单优化方法可显著提升稀疏模型性能。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in size, efficient compression
techniques like quantization and sparsification are critical. While
quantization maintains performance with reduced precision, structured sparsity
methods, such as N:M sparsification, often fall short due to limited
flexibility, and sensitivity to outlier weights. We explore 8:16
semi-structured sparsity, demonstrating its ability to surpass the Performance
Threshold-where a compressed model matches the accuracy of its uncompressed or
smaller counterpart under equivalent memory constraints. Compared to 2:4
sparsity, 8:16 offers greater flexibility with minimal storage overhead (0.875
vs. 0.75 bits/element). We also apply sparse structured patterns for salient
weights, showing that structured sparsity for outliers is competitive with
unstructured approaches leading to equivalent or better results. Finally, we
demonstrate that simple techniques such as variance correction and SmoothQuant
like weight equalization improve sparse models performance.

Result: 元学习模型在二元分类任务中优于VLLMs，但在三元分类任务中VLLMs略优。

Conclusion: VLLMs表现有潜力，但可靠性和实用性需进一步研究。

Abstract: With the rise of online learning, the demand for efficient and consistent
assessment in mathematics has significantly increased over the past decade.
Machine Learning (ML), particularly Natural Language Processing (NLP), has been
widely used for autograding student responses, particularly those involving
text and/or mathematical expressions. However, there has been limited research
on autograding responses involving students' handwritten graphs, despite their
prevalence in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)
curricula. In this study, we implement multimodal meta-learning models for
autograding images containing students' handwritten graphs and text. We further
compare the performance of Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) with these
specially trained metalearning models. Our results, evaluated on a real-world
dataset collected from our institution, show that the best-performing
meta-learning models outperform VLLMs in 2-way classification tasks. In
contrast, in more complex 3-way classification tasks, the best-performing VLLMs
slightly outperform the meta-learning models. While VLLMs show promising
results, their reliability and practical applicability remain uncertain and
require further investigation.

TL;DR: BERT4Traj是一种基于Transformer的模型，用于从稀疏移动数据中重建完整的人类移动轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类移动数据常因采集方法（如低频GPS或CDR数据）而稀疏，限制了其在公共卫生、交通和城市规划中的应用。

Method: BERT4Traj结合空间嵌入、时间嵌入和背景特征（如人口统计和锚点），利用BERT的掩码语言建模和自注意力机制预测隐藏访问点。

Result: 在乌干达坎帕拉的CDR和GPS数据集上，BERT4Traj显著优于传统模型（如马尔可夫链、KNN、RNN和LSTM）。

Conclusion: BERT4Traj能有效重建连续且详细的移动轨迹，为人类移动模式提供了更深入的洞察。

Abstract: Understanding human mobility is essential for applications in public health,
transportation, and urban planning. However, mobility data often suffers from
sparsity due to limitations in data collection methods, such as infrequent GPS
sampling or call detail record (CDR) data that only capture locations during
communication events. To address this challenge, we propose BERT4Traj, a
transformer based model that reconstructs complete mobility trajectories by
predicting hidden visits in sparse movement sequences. Inspired by BERT's
masked language modeling objective and self_attention mechanisms, BERT4Traj
leverages spatial embeddings, temporal embeddings, and contextual background
features such as demographics and anchor points. We evaluate BERT4Traj on real
world CDR and GPS datasets collected in Kampala, Uganda, demonstrating that our
approach significantly outperforms traditional models such as Markov Chains,
KNN, RNNs, and LSTMs. Our results show that BERT4Traj effectively reconstructs
detailed and continuous mobility trajectories, enhancing insights into human
movement patterns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Helmholtz Machine (HM) 在无监督学习中的对称数据驱动更新限制了其目标导向推理和时序过程模拟能力，需要一种新方法来结合目标驱动的推理和生成模型。

Method: C²HM 通过目标驱动的非对称推理，结合生成和识别模型的循环一致性，利用变分循环对齐目标条件潜在预测和识别重建。

Result: C²HM 提高了表示效率，支持路径依赖推理的记忆链式操作，并实现了空间组合想象。

Conclusion: C²HM 为生成建模提供了生物启发的替代方案，将基于记忆的规划和无监督学习统一在一个概率框架中。

Abstract: The Helmholtz Machine (HM) is a foundational architecture for unsupervised
learning, coupling a bottom-up recognition model with a top-down generative
model through alternating inference. However, its reliance on symmetric,
data-driven updates constrains its ability to perform goal-directed reasoning
or simulate temporally extended processes. In this work, we introduce the
\emph{Cycle-Consistent Helmholtz Machine} (C$^2$HM), a novel extension that
reframes inference as a \emph{goal-seeded}, \emph{asymmetric} process grounded
in structured internal priors. Rather than inferring latent causes solely from
sensory data, C$^2$HM simulates plausible latent trajectories conditioned on
abstract goals, aligning them with observed outcomes through a recursive cycle
of forward generation and inverse refinement. This cycle-consistent formulation
integrates top-down structure with bottom-up evidence via a variational loop,
enforcing mutual alignment between goal-conditioned latent predictions and
recognition-based reconstructions. We formalize this mechanism within the
framework of the \emph{Context-Content Uncertainty Principle} (CCUP), which
posits that inference proceeds by aligning structured, low-entropy content with
high-entropy, ambiguous context. C$^2$HM improves representational efficiency,
supports memory chaining via path-dependent inference, and enables spatial
compositional imagination. By offering a biologically inspired alternative to
classical amortized inference, $C^2$HM reconceives generative modeling as
intentional simulation, bridging memory-based planning and unsupervised
learning in a unified probabilistic framework.

TL;DR: 提出一种方法，将基于全状态测量的反馈控制策略适应于仅部分测量的场景，通过模拟环境验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流体系统的高维、非线性和多尺度动态特性使得反馈控制具有挑战性，而实际应用中传感器通常只能提供部分测量数据。

Method: 训练一个领域特定特征转移（DSFT）映射，从部分测量的历史数据中重建全状态测量，并基于此推导最优控制策略。

Result: 在模拟环境中成功减少了简化道路车辆的空气阻力，并确定了最优历史长度和控制策略架构。

Conclusion: 该方法为传感器信息受限的实际环境提供了可行的控制策略实现方案。

Abstract: Feedback control of fluid-based systems poses significant challenges due to
their high-dimensional, nonlinear, and multiscale dynamics, which demand
real-time, three-dimensional, multi-component measurements for sensing. While
such measurements are feasible in digital simulations, they are often only
partially accessible in the real world. In this paper, we propose a method to
adapt feedback control policies obtained from full-state measurements to setups
with only partial measurements. Our approach is demonstrated in a simulated
environment by minimising the aerodynamic drag of a simplified road vehicle.
Reinforcement learning algorithms can optimally solve this control task when
trained on full-state measurements by placing sensors in the wake. However, in
real-world applications, sensors are limited and typically only on the vehicle,
providing only partial measurements. To address this, we propose to train a
Domain Specific Feature Transfer (DSFT) map reconstructing the full
measurements from the history of the partial measurements. By applying this
map, we derive optimal policies based solely on partial data. Additionally, our
method enables determination of the optimal history length and offers insights
into the architecture of optimal control policies, facilitating their
implementation in real-world environments with limited sensor information.

Motivation: 研究目标泛化错误的可能性及其在不同训练目标下的表现，以提升策略在部署环境中的安全性。

Method: 通过理论分析和实验验证，比较了MEV和MMER目标在程序生成的网格世界环境中的表现。

Result: MEV方法存在目标泛化错误，而MMER方法对此更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 最小化最大期望遗憾（MMER）是缓解目标泛化错误的有效方法。

Abstract: Safe generalization in reinforcement learning requires not only that a
learned policy acts capably in new situations, but also that it uses its
capabilities towards the pursuit of the designer's intended goal. The latter
requirement may fail when a proxy goal incentivizes similar behavior to the
intended goal within the training environment, but not in novel deployment
environments. This creates the risk that policies will behave as if in pursuit
of the proxy goal, rather than the intended goal, in deployment -- a phenomenon
known as goal misgeneralization. In this paper, we formalize this problem
setting in order to theoretically study the possibility of goal
misgeneralization under different training objectives. We show that goal
misgeneralization is possible under approximate optimization of the maximum
expected value (MEV) objective, but not the minimax expected regret (MMER)
objective. We then empirically show that the standard MEV-based training method
of domain randomization exhibits goal misgeneralization in
procedurally-generated grid-world environments, whereas current regret-based
unsupervised environment design (UED) methods are more robust to goal
misgeneralization (though they don't find MMER policies in all cases). Our
findings suggest that minimax expected regret is a promising approach to
mitigating goal misgeneralization.

Abstract: We present a data-domain sampling regime for quantifying CNNs' graphic
perception behaviors. This regime lets us evaluate CNNs' ratio estimation
ability in bar charts from three perspectives: sensitivity to training-test
distribution discrepancies, stability to limited samples, and relative
expertise to human observers. After analyzing 16 million trials from 800 CNNs
models and 6,825 trials from 113 human participants, we arrived at a simple and
actionable conclusion: CNNs can outperform humans and their biases simply
depend on the training-test distance. We show evidence of this simple, elegant
behavior of the machines when they interpret visualization images. osf.io/gfqc3

Result: 在风速场和等离子体演化重建任务中，NeuralDMD优于基线方法。

Conclusion: NeuralDMD是跨地球科学、天文学等领域重建动态系统的潜在通用工具。

Abstract: Dynamical systems are ubiquitous within science and engineering, from
turbulent flow across aircraft wings to structural variability of proteins.
Although some systems are well understood and simulated, scientific imaging
often confronts never-before-seen dynamics observed through indirect, noisy,
and highly sparse measurements. We present NeuralDMD, a model-free framework
that combines neural implicit representations with Dynamic Mode Decomposition
(DMD) to reconstruct continuous spatio-temporal dynamics from such
measurements. The expressiveness of neural representations enables capturing
complex spatial structures, while the linear dynamical modes of DMD introduce
an inductive bias that guides training and supports stable, low-dimensional
representations and forecasting. We validate NeuralDMD on two real-world
problems: reconstructing near-surface wind-speed fields over North America from
sparse station observations, and recovering the evolution of plasma near the
Galactic-center black hole, Sgr A*. In both cases, NeuralDMD outperforms
established baselines, demonstrating its potential as a general tool for
imaging dynamical systems across geoscience, astronomy, and beyond.

Result: 该方法显著提升了在线策略学习方法的性能。

Conclusion: 结合自然语言和LLMs的方法为健康行为干预提供了更高效的状态空间扩展方案。

Abstract: The use of reinforcement learning (RL) methods to support health behavior
change via personalized and just-in-time adaptive interventions is of
significant interest to health and behavioral science researchers focused on
problems such as smoking cessation support and physical activity promotion.
However, RL methods are often applied to these domains using a small collection
of context variables to mitigate the significant data scarcity issues that
arise from practical limitations on the design of adaptive intervention trials.
In this paper, we explore an approach to significantly expanding the state
space of an adaptive intervention without impacting data efficiency. The
proposed approach enables intervention participants to provide natural language
descriptions of aspects of their current state. It then leverages inference
with pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to better align the policy of a
base RL method with these state descriptions. To evaluate our method, we
develop a novel physical activity intervention simulation environment that
generates text-based state descriptions conditioned on latent state variables
using an auxiliary LLM. We show that this approach has the potential to
significantly improve the performance of online policy learning methods.

Conclusion: SymMatika展示了结构感知进化搜索在科学发现中的潜力，并开源以促进可解释建模和符号发现研究。

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) seeks to recover closed-form mathematical
expressions that describe observed data. While existing methods have advanced
the discovery of either explicit mappings (i.e., $y = f(\mathbf{x})$) or
discovering implicit relations (i.e., $F(\mathbf{x}, y)=0$), few modern and
accessible frameworks support both. Moreover, most approaches treat each
expression candidate in isolation, without reusing recurring structural
patterns that could accelerate search. We introduce SymMatika, a hybrid SR
algorithm that combines multi-island genetic programming (GP) with a reusable
motif library inspired by biological sequence analysis. SymMatika identifies
high-impact substructures in top-performing candidates and reintroduces them to
guide future generations. Additionally, it incorporates a feedback-driven
evolutionary engine and supports both explicit and implicit relation discovery
using implicit-derivative metrics. Across benchmarks, SymMatika achieves
state-of-the-art recovery rates, achieving 5.1% higher performance than the
previous best results on Nguyen, the first recovery of Nguyen-12, and
competitive performance on the Feynman equations. It also recovers implicit
physical laws from Eureqa datasets up to $100\times$ faster. Our results
demonstrate the power of structure-aware evolutionary search for scientific
discovery. To support broader research in interpretable modeling and symbolic
discovery, we have open-sourced the full SymMatika framework.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于交互式可视化的RLHF方法，通过分组比较提升人类反馈效率，最终提高策略性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLHF依赖成对比较，效率低且难以全面利用人类视觉能力。本文旨在通过交互式可视化改进数据收集方式。

Method: 设计了一个包含探索视图和比较视图的交互界面，结合主动学习方法，支持用户高效探索行为样本。

Result: 在六个模拟机器人任务中，该方法将最终策略回报提高了69.34%，降低了错误率并生成更优策略。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了RLHF的效率和效果，开源代码便于集成到RLHF训练流程中，推动人机对齐研究。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key
enabling technology for aligning AI behavior with human preferences. The
traditional way to collect data in RLHF is via pairwise comparisons: human
raters are asked to indicate which one of two samples they prefer. We present
an interactive visualization that better exploits the human visual ability to
compare and explore whole groups of samples. The interface is comprised of two
linked views: 1) an exploration view showing a contextual overview of all
sampled behaviors organized in a hierarchical clustering structure; and 2) a
comparison view displaying two selected groups of behaviors for user queries.
Users can efficiently explore large sets of behaviors by iterating between
these two views. Additionally, we devised an active learning approach
suggesting groups for comparison. As shown by our evaluation in six simulated
robotics tasks, our approach increases the final policy returns by 69.34%. It
leads to lower error rates and better policies. We open-source the code that
can be easily integrated into the RLHF training loop, supporting research on
human-AI alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模ML模型的能耗主要由数据移动主导，现有稀疏化方法存在精度下降或性能开销问题。

Method: BLaST迭代稀疏化权重矩阵为适合高效稀疏矩阵乘法的块稀疏模式，并优化稀疏MLP内核。

Conclusion: BLaST通过减少能耗、内存占用和延迟，推动下一代大规模AI系统的发展。

Abstract: The energy consumption of large-scale ML models is dominated by data movement
- shuffling billions of parameters across memory hierarchies and data centers.
Effective sparsification to prune redundant parameters is still challenging:
existing methods incur significant accuracy degradation, performance overhead,
or both. We introduce (Bl)ock (a)nd (S)parse (T)ransformers (BLaST), a general,
robust, and reliable sparsification method applicable to linear layers in all
settings. Our method iteratively sparsifies weight matrices into a block
sparsity pattern suitable for efficient sparse matrix-matrix (SpMM)
multiplication. BLaST achieves up to 95% sparsity in MLP weights with
negligible accuracy loss. Our fused, highly optimized Sparse MLP kernel
delivers up to 16.7x speedup over dense MLPs across 9 architectures and 8
datasets, resulting in up to 1.6x inference speedup, 1.11x pretraining speedup
and up to 3.12x inference memory usage reduction. BLaST enables the next
generation of large-scale AI systems by reducing energy use, memory footprint,
and latency.

Conclusion: 神经网络方法不仅适用于单平衡计算，还可扩展至连续平衡分布建模，具有显著改进潜力。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to compute three-dimensional Magnetohydrodynamic
equilibria by parametrizing Fourier modes with artificial neural networks and
compare it to equilibria computed by conventional solvers. The full nonlinear
global force residual across the volume in real space is then minimized with
first order optimizers. Already,we observe competitive computational cost to
arrive at the same minimum residuals computed by existing codes. With increased
computational cost,lower minima of the residual are achieved by the neural
networks,establishing a new lower bound for the force residual. We use
minimally complex neural networks,and we expect significant improvements for
solving not only single equilibria with neural networks,but also for computing
neural network models valid over continuous distributions of equilibria.

Motivation: 探究LLMs在自信与怀疑之间的矛盾行为，揭示其内在机制。

Method: 开发实验范式，利用LLMs生成无记忆的置信度估计，分析Gemma 3、GPT4o和o1-preview等模型的行为。

Result: LLMs表现出选择支持性偏见和对不一致建议的过度反应，偏离贝叶斯更新规范。

Conclusion: LLMs的自信机制解释了其固执和对批评的过度敏感，为理解其行为提供了机制性解释。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strikingly conflicting behaviors: they
can appear steadfastly overconfident in their initial answers whilst at the
same time being prone to excessive doubt when challenged. To investigate this
apparent paradox, we developed a novel experimental paradigm, exploiting the
unique ability to obtain confidence estimates from LLMs without creating memory
of their initial judgments -- something impossible in human participants. We
show that LLMs -- Gemma 3, GPT4o and o1-preview -- exhibit a pronounced
choice-supportive bias that reinforces and boosts their estimate of confidence
in their answer, resulting in a marked resistance to change their mind. We
further demonstrate that LLMs markedly overweight inconsistent compared to
consistent advice, in a fashion that deviates qualitatively from normative
Bayesian updating. Finally, we demonstrate that these two mechanisms -- a drive
to maintain consistency with prior commitments and hypersensitivity to
contradictory feedback -- parsimoniously capture LLM behavior in a different
domain. Together, these findings furnish a mechanistic account of LLM
confidence that explains both their stubbornness and excessive sensitivity to
criticism.

Conclusion: 集合值预测器是提升域泛化鲁棒性的有前景方向，理论框架和优化方法为其提供了支持。

Abstract: Despite the impressive advancements in modern machine learning, achieving
robustness in Domain Generalization (DG) tasks remains a significant challenge.
In DG, models are expected to perform well on samples from unseen test
distributions (also called domains), by learning from multiple related training
distributions. Most existing approaches to this problem rely on single-valued
predictions, which inherently limit their robustness. We argue that set-valued
predictors could be leveraged to enhance robustness across unseen domains,
while also taking into account that these sets should be as small as possible.
We introduce a theoretical framework defining successful set prediction in the
DG setting, focusing on meeting a predefined performance criterion across as
many domains as possible, and provide theoretical insights into the conditions
under which such domain generalization is achievable. We further propose a
practical optimization method compatible with modern learning architectures,
that balances robust performance on unseen domains with small prediction set
sizes. We evaluate our approach on several real-world datasets from the WILDS
benchmark, demonstrating its potential as a promising direction for robust
domain generalization.

<details>

Motivation: 解决大语言模型推理中GPU内存限制和KV缓存需求增长的问题，同时避免现有方法对CPU计算资源的低效利用和准确性损失。

Method: HGCA在GPU上保留最近生成的KV条目进行密集注意力计算，同时在CPU上对选定的关键KV条目进行并行稀疏注意力计算，并通过log-sum-exp融合高效合并结果。

Result: 实验表明，HGCA在多种模型和工作负载下表现出卓越的可扩展性，支持更长的序列和更大的批量，同时在性能和准确性上优于现有稀疏注意力基线。

Conclusion: HGCA在商品GPU硬件上实现了高效、高吞吐量的大语言模型推理，且无需模型重新训练。

Abstract: Scaling inference for large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
constrained by limited GPU memory, especially due to growing key-value (KV)
caches required for long-context generation. While existing approaches offload
KV caches to CPU memory or apply sparse attention to reduce GPU load, they
often underutilize CPU compute resources and compromise accuracy. We present
HGCA, a hybrid CPU-GPU attention mechanism that enables scalable,
high-throughput LLM inference with near-full attention quality. HGCA performs
dense attention on recently generated KV entries retained in GPU memory and
parallel sparse attention on selected, salient KV entries in CPU memory. The
attention outputs are efficiently merged using log-sum-exp fusion, minimizing
PCIe transfer overhead. HGCA also introduces a finegrained, per-head
sparsification strategy optimized for CPU execution, preserving contextual
relevance while reducing computation. Our implementation seamlessly integrates
into existing LLM frameworks without requiring model retraining. Experiments
across diverse models and workloads show that HGCA achieves superior
scalability, supports longer sequences and larger batch sizes, and outperforms
existing sparse attention baselines in both performance and accuracy -- all on
commodity GPU hardware.

TL;DR: PiCME提出了一种多模态对比学习方法，用于整合临床数据，并通过Modality-Gated LSTM提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态深度学习在临床预测中潜力巨大，但现有方法主要局限于图像和文本对，缺乏对其他数据类型的系统性评估。

Method: 提出PiCME框架，评估26种多模态组合，并引入Modality-Gated LSTM动态加权各模态。

Result: 对比学习方法在三模态下表现优异，五模态时性能下降，但Modality-Gated LSTM显著提升性能（AUROC从73.19%到76.93%）。

Conclusion: PiCME为多模态临床预测提供了指导，强调了模态选择和公平性的重要性。

Abstract: Multimodal deep learning holds promise for improving clinical prediction by
integrating diverse patient data, including text, imaging, time-series, and
structured demographics. Contrastive learning facilitates this integration by
producing a unified representation that can be reused across tasks, reducing
the need for separate models or encoders. Although contrastive learning has
seen success in vision-language domains, its use in clinical settings remains
largely limited to image and text pairs. We propose the Pipeline for
Contrastive Modality Evaluation and Encoding (PiCME), which systematically
assesses five clinical data types from MIMIC: discharge summaries, radiology
reports, chest X-rays, demographics, and time-series. We pre-train contrastive
models on all 26 combinations of two to five modalities and evaluate their
utility on in-hospital mortality and phenotype prediction. To address
performance plateaus with more modalities, we introduce a Modality-Gated LSTM
that weights each modality according to its contrastively learned importance.
Our results show that contrastive models remain competitive with supervised
baselines, particularly in three-modality settings. Performance declines beyond
three modalities, which supervised models fail to recover. The Modality-Gated
LSTM mitigates this drop, improving AUROC from 73.19% to 76.93% and AUPRC from
51.27% to 62.26% in the five-modality setting. We also compare contrastively
learned modality importance scores with attribution scores and evaluate
generalization across demographic subgroups, highlighting strengths in
interpretability and fairness. PiCME is the first to scale contrastive learning
across all modality combinations in MIMIC, offering guidance for modality
selection, training strategies, and equitable clinical prediction.

Result: AI模型在形状依赖、抽象形状识别、抗干扰和对抗攻击方面表现优于现有高参数模型。

Conclusion: 通过优化学习方式而非增加数据量，可以实现更高效、更接近人类视觉的AI系统。

Abstract: Despite years of research and the dramatic scaling of artificial intelligence
(AI) systems, a striking misalignment between artificial and human vision
persists. Contrary to humans, AI heavily relies on texture-features rather than
shape information, lacks robustness to image distortions, remains highly
vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and struggles to recognise simple abstract
shapes within complex backgrounds. To close this gap, we here introduce a
solution that arises from a previously underexplored direction: rather than
scaling up, we take inspiration from how human vision develops from early
infancy into adulthood. We quantified the visual maturation by synthesising
decades of psychophysical and neurophysiological research into a novel
developmental visual diet (DVD) for AI vision. We show that guiding AI systems
through this human-inspired curriculum produces models that closely align with
human behaviour on every hallmark of robust vision tested yielding the
strongest reported reliance on shape information to date, abstract shape
recognition beyond the state of the art, higher robustness to image
corruptions, and stronger resilience to adversarial attacks. By outperforming
high parameter AI foundation models trained on orders of magnitude more data,
we provide evidence that robust AI vision can be achieved by guiding the way
how a model learns, not merely how much it learns, offering a
resource-efficient route toward safer and more human-like artificial visual
systems.

Conclusion: LaTF能够从有限温度数据中重建温度依赖的结构集合和熔化行为，与实验和计算研究一致。

Abstract: Accurate characterization of the equilibrium distributions of complex
molecular systems and their dependence on environmental factors such as
temperature is essential for understanding thermodynamic properties and
transition mechanisms. Projecting these distributions onto meaningful
low-dimensional representations enables interpretability and downstream
analysis. Recent advances in generative AI, particularly flow models such as
Normalizing Flows (NFs), have shown promise in modeling such distributions, but
their scope is limited without tailored representation learning. In this work,
we introduce Latent Thermodynamic Flows (LaTF), an end-to-end framework that
tightly integrates representation learning and generative modeling. LaTF
unifies the State Predictive Information Bottleneck (SPIB) with NFs to
simultaneously learn low-dimensional latent representations, referred to as
Collective Variables (CVs), classify metastable states, and generate
equilibrium distributions across temperatures beyond the training data. The two
components of representation learning and generative modeling are optimized
jointly, ensuring that the learned latent features capture the system's slow,
important degrees of freedom while the generative model accurately reproduces
the system's equilibrium behavior. We demonstrate LaTF's effectiveness across
diverse systems, including a model potential, the Chignolin protein, and
cluster of Lennard Jones particles, with thorough evaluations and benchmarking
using multiple metrics and extensive simulations. Finally, we apply LaTF to a
RNA tetraloop system, where despite using simulation data from only two
temperatures, LaTF reconstructs the temperature-dependent structural ensemble
and melting behavior, consistent with experimental and prior extensive
computational results.

Abstract: Transfer learning has become an essential paradigm in artificial
intelligence, enabling the transfer of knowledge from a source task to improve
performance on a target task. This approach, particularly through techniques
such as pretraining and fine-tuning, has seen significant success in fields
like computer vision and natural language processing. However, despite its
widespread use, how to reliably assess the transferability of knowledge remains
a challenge. Understanding the theoretical underpinnings of each
transferability metric is critical for ensuring the success of transfer
learning. In this survey, we provide a unified taxonomy of transferability
metrics, categorizing them based on transferable knowledge types and
measurement granularity. This work examines the various metrics developed to
evaluate the potential of source knowledge for transfer learning and their
applicability across different learning paradigms emphasizing the need for
careful selection of these metrics. By offering insights into how different
metrics work under varying conditions, this survey aims to guide researchers
and practitioners in selecting the most appropriate metric for specific
applications, contributing to more efficient, reliable, and trustworthy AI
systems. Finally, we discuss some open challenges in this field and propose
future research directions to further advance the application of
transferability metrics in trustworthy transfer learning.

Motivation: 解决零阶优化（ZO）在大型语言模型（LLMs）微调中的内存和计算瓶颈问题，尤其是单设备执行和低吞吐量的限制。

Method: 提出DistZO2框架，结合三种并行策略（PertP、DDP和2D并行）及硬件感知通信策略，优化参数卸载和计算效率。

Result: 在OPT-175B模型上，DistZO2比ZO2实现了3倍的加速，同时保持了内存效率。

Conclusion: DistZO2成功扩展了零阶微调在多GPU系统上的应用，显著提升了训练效率，代码已开源。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) remains resource-intensive due to
their sheer scale. While zeroth-order (ZO) optimization provides a
memory-efficient alternative by eliminating backward passes, its application to
multi-hundred-billion-parameter models is constrained by GPU memory and compute
throughput. The ZO2 framework addresses the memory bottleneck by offloading
model parameters to CPU memory and overlapping transformer block transfer with
dual forward computation on a single GPU. However, ZO2 remains limited by its
single-device execution and achieves modest throughput. In this work, we
present DistZO2, a high-throughput, memory-efficient framework for distributed
zeroth-order fine-tuning of LLMs. DistZO2 introduces three parallel strategies:
(1) Perturbation Parallelism (PertP), which parallelizes the two perturbed
forward passes across devices; (2) Distributed Data Parallelism (DDP), adapted
to the scalar-gradient nature of ZO training; and (3) a unified 2D Parallelism
design that combines PertP and DDP. To further mitigate communication
bottlenecks introduced by parameter offloading, we propose a hardware-aware
communication strategy that slices parameter blocks and redistributes them
across GPUs via high-speed interconnects such as NVLink. DistZO2 scales
zeroth-order fine-tuning to modern multi-GPU systems, preserving ZO2's memory
efficiency while substantially improving training throughput. In our
experiments on OPT-175B, DistZO2 achieves a 3x speedup over ZO2 with
distributed computing. DistZO2's code has been open-sourced in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态路由模型在神经网络群体中基于信号选择架构，但缺乏对共享信号的抑制机制，限制了模型性能。

Method: 引入神经抑制算法，抑制数据统计模式中的共享信号，使路由模型能选择更专业的路径。

Result: 实验证明神经抑制算法显著提升通用任务性能。

Conclusion: 神经抑制是混合专家、动态路由和Transformer语言模型中未充分研究的方法，值得进一步探索。

Abstract: To be effective, efficient, and diverse, deep learning models need to
dynamically choose its architecture based on signals from a population of
neurons. We hypothesize dynamic routing models can be improved with neural
inhibition in those neural populations. This means signals commonly shared
among the various modes of data statistics can be inhibited so that the routing
model can choose a specialized expert path for each data sample. Only through
inhibition is the routing mechanism able to effectively select neural pathways.
We believe this is an under-studied and under-verified implementation
methodology for Mixture-of-Experts, dynamic routing, and transformer language
models. We provide experimental evidence that the neural inhibition algorithm
significantly boosts the performance of general tasks and motivates more effort
to be invested in this research direction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Conformal Information Pursuit (C-IP)的方法，用于优化大型语言模型（LLM）在交互式问答任务中的顺序查询策略，以减少查询次数并提高预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的Information Pursuit (IP)方法在估计互信息或条件熵时因LLM的概率估计不准确而表现不佳，导致查询选择不理想。

Method: C-IP利用保形预测集（conformal prediction sets）来估计不确定性，通过预测集的平均大小来衡量信息增益，避免了直接计算条件熵的困难。

Result: 在20 Questions任务和MediQ数据集上的实验表明，C-IP在预测性能和查询效率上优于传统IP方法，同时提供了更高的可解释性。

Conclusion: C-IP是一种分布自由且鲁棒的顺序信息增益估计方法，适用于交互式问答任务，尤其在需要高可解释性的场景中表现优异。

Abstract: A significant use case of instruction-finetuned Large Language Models (LLMs)
is to solve question-answering tasks interactively. In this setting, an LLM
agent is tasked with making a prediction by sequentially querying relevant
information from the user, as opposed to a single-turn conversation. This paper
explores sequential querying strategies that aim to minimize the expected
number of queries. One such strategy is Information Pursuit (IP), a greedy
algorithm that at each iteration selects the query that maximizes information
gain or equivalently minimizes uncertainty. However, obtaining accurate
estimates of mutual information or conditional entropy for LLMs is very
difficult in practice due to over- or under-confident LLM probabilities, which
leads to suboptimal query selection and predictive performance. To better
estimate the uncertainty at each iteration, we propose Conformal Information
Pursuit (C-IP), an alternative approach to sequential information gain based on
conformal prediction sets. More specifically, C-IP leverages a relationship
between prediction sets and conditional entropy at each iteration to estimate
uncertainty based on the average size of conformal prediction sets. In contrast
to conditional entropy, we find that conformal prediction sets are a
distribution-free and robust method of measuring uncertainty. Experiments with
20 Questions show that C-IP obtains better predictive performance and shorter
query-answer chains compared to previous approaches to IP and uncertainty-based
chain-of-thought methods. Furthermore, extending to an interactive medical
setting between a doctor and a patient on the MediQ dataset, C-IP achieves
competitive performance with direct single-turn prediction while offering
greater interpretability.

Result: 结果表明，LRTM能有效重建S5P-TN产品中的缺失值，尤其在云层遮挡、预测异常值和热点识别方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 研究证实了动态变量的低秩特性，并展示了LRTM在大气数据填补中的潜力。

Abstract: In this study, we investigate for the first time the low-rank properties of a
tensorized large-scale spatio-temporal dynamic atmospheric variable. We focus
on the Sentinel-5P tropospheric NO2 product (S5P-TN) over a four-year period in
an area that encompasses the contiguous United States (CONUS). Here, it is
demonstrated that a low-rank approximation of such a dynamic variable is
feasible. We apply the low-rank properties of the S5P-TN data to inpaint gaps
in the Sentinel-5P product by adopting a low-rank tensor model (LRTM) based on
the CANDECOMP / PARAFAC (CP) decomposition and alternating least squares (ALS).
Furthermore, we evaluate the LRTM's results by comparing them with spatial
interpolation using geostatistics, and conduct a comprehensive spatial
statistical and temporal analysis of the S5P-TN product. The results of this
study demonstrated that the tensor completion successfully reconstructs the
missing values in the S5P-TN product, particularly in the presence of extended
cloud obscuration, predicting outliers and identifying hotspots, when the data
is tensorized over extended spatial and temporal scales.

*Lingkun Luo,Shiqiang Hu,Liming Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GVI-DA提出了一种基于全局变分推断的领域自适应方法，通过全局先验学习和潜在特征重构提升跨领域对齐效果，并在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的领域自适应方法依赖小批量训练，导致全局分布建模不足，对齐不稳定且泛化能力有限。

Method: GVI-DA通过变分推断学习连续、类别条件的全局先验，结合潜在特征重构和全局码本学习，同时利用伪标签筛选和可靠样本生成提升鲁棒性。

Result: 在四个基准测试和三十八个任务中，GVI-DA表现优于现有方法，并分析了先验连续性、码本大小和伪标签噪声容忍度的影响。

Conclusion: GVI-DA在理论和实践上均表现出色，与扩散生成框架相比具有优化原则和效率上的优势。

Abstract: Deep learning-based domain adaptation (DA) methods have shown strong
performance by learning transferable representations. However, their reliance
on mini-batch training limits global distribution modeling, leading to unstable
alignment and suboptimal generalization. We propose Global Variational
Inference Enhanced Domain Adaptation (GVI-DA), a framework that learns
continuous, class-conditional global priors via variational inference to enable
structure-aware cross-domain alignment. GVI-DA minimizes domain gaps through
latent feature reconstruction, and mitigates posterior collapse using global
codebook learning with randomized sampling. It further improves robustness by
discarding low-confidence pseudo-labels and generating reliable target-domain
samples. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks and thirty-eight DA tasks
demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art performance. We also derive the model's
evidence lower bound (ELBO) and analyze the effects of prior continuity,
codebook size, and pseudo-label noise tolerance. In addition, we compare GVI-DA
with diffusion-based generative frameworks in terms of optimization principles
and efficiency, highlighting both its theoretical soundness and practical
advantages.

*Guangyan Li,Yongqiang Tang,Wensheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多粒度自适应参数分配方法（MGAA），用于优化大语言模型（LLM）的低秩近似压缩，通过自适应分配参数提升压缩效率和模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有低秩近似压缩方法通常对所有权重矩阵采用统一压缩比例，忽略了其对模型性能的差异化影响，且现有启发式搜索策略计算效率低、泛化能力差。

Method: MGAA方法包括两部分：1）在不同子层间基于输入输出余弦相似度分配压缩比例；2）在子层内基于权重矩阵能量分布特性分配压缩比例。

Result: 在多个LLM主干模型和基准数据集上的评估表明，MGAA性能优越，且在多模态模型LLaVA上表现出显著性能提升。

Conclusion: MGAA通过自适应参数分配，显著提升了低秩近似压缩的效率和模型性能，适用于LLM和多模态模型。

Abstract: The enormous parameter scale of large language models (LLMs) has made model
compression a research hotspot, which aims to alleviate computational resource
demands during deployment and inference. As a promising direction, low-rank
approximation technique has made remarkable achievements. Nevertheless,
unfortunately, the vast majority of studies to low-rank approximation
compression generally apply uniform compression ratios across all weight
matrices, while disregarding their inherently differentiated impacts on the
model's performance. Although a few recent work attempts to employ heuristic
search strategies to achieve the optimal parameter allocation, such strategies
are computationally inefficient and lose the generalization ability in the era
of LLMs. In this study, we propose a novel parameter Multi-Granular Adaptive
Allocation (MGAA) method, which can adaptively allocate parameters between and
within sublayers without task-specific evaluations in the compression process.
MGAA consists of two components: 1) Among different sublayers, it assigns
compression ratios based on their cosine similarity between inputs and outputs,
allowing for a more tailored compression in sublayers with varying degrees of
importance, and 2) Within each sublayer, it allocates different compression
ratios to weight matrices based on their energy distribution characteristics,
ensuring a consistent energy retention ratio while optimizing compression
efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations of MGAA across multiple LLMs backbone
models and benchmark datasets demonstrate its superior performance.
Additionally, we apply our MGAA to multimodal model LLaVA, exhibiting
remarkable performance improvements.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出Dyn-O，一种基于对象中心表示的结构化世界模型，用于在复杂环境中更有效地捕捉动态和增强组合泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对象中心世界模型在视觉复杂度有限的环境中表现良好，但在复杂场景（如多样纹理和杂乱场景）中的泛化能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 引入Dyn-O，改进对象中心表示的学习和动态建模，并将其特征解耦为动态无关和动态感知组件。

Result: 在Procgen游戏中，Dyn-O直接从像素观察中学习对象中心世界模型，在预测准确性上优于DreamerV3。

Conclusion: Dyn-O在复杂环境中表现出色，通过解耦特征实现更精细的操控和更多样化的轨迹生成。

Abstract: World models aim to capture the dynamics of the environment, enabling agents
to predict and plan for future states. In most scenarios of interest, the
dynamics are highly centered on interactions among objects within the
environment. This motivates the development of world models that operate on
object-centric rather than monolithic representations, with the goal of more
effectively capturing environment dynamics and enhancing compositional
generalization. However, the development of object-centric world models has
largely been explored in environments with limited visual complexity (such as
basic geometries). It remains underexplored whether such models can generalize
to more complex settings with diverse textures and cluttered scenes. In this
paper, we fill this gap by introducing Dyn-O, an enhanced structured world
model built upon object-centric representations. Compared to prior work in
object-centric representations, Dyn-O improves in both learning representations
and modeling dynamics. On the challenging Procgen games, we find that our
method can learn object-centric world models directly from pixel observations,
outperforming DreamerV3 in rollout prediction accuracy. Furthermore, by
decoupling object-centric features into dynamics-agnostic and dynamics-aware
components, we enable finer-grained manipulation of these features and generate
more diverse imagined trajectories.

Abstract: Vehicle routing problems (VRPs) are central to combinatorial optimization
with significant practical implications. Recent advancements in neural
combinatorial optimization (NCO) have demonstrated promising results by
leveraging neural networks to solve VRPs, yet the exploration of model scaling
within this domain remains underexplored. Inspired by the success of model
scaling in large language models (LLMs), this study introduces a Large Routing
Model with 1 billion parameters (LRM-1B), designed to address diverse VRP
scenarios. We present a comprehensive evaluation of LRM-1B across multiple
problem variants, distributions, and sizes, establishing state-of-the-art
results. Our findings reveal that LRM-1B not only adapts to different VRP
challenges but also showcases superior performance, outperforming existing
models. Additionally, we explore the scaling behavior of neural routing models
from 1M to 1B parameters. Our analysis confirms power-law between multiple
model factors and performance, offering critical insights into the optimal
configurations for foundation neural routing solvers.

Result: 实验表明，ReTimeCausal在不规则采样和缺失数据条件下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ReTimeCausal填补了现有方法在时间序列因果发现中的关键空白，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: This paper studies causal discovery in irregularly sampled time series-a
pivotal challenge in high-stakes domains like finance, healthcare, and climate
science, where missing data and inconsistent sampling frequencies distort
causal mechanisms. Traditional methods (e.g., Granger causality, PCMCI) fail to
reconcile multi-scale interactions (e.g., hourly storms vs. decadal climate
shifts), while neural approaches (e.g., CUTS+) lack interpretability, stemming
from a critical gap: existing frameworks either rigidly assume temporal
regularity or aggregate dynamics into opaque representations, neglecting
real-world granularity and auditable logic. To bridge this gap, we propose
ReTimeCausal, a novel integration of Additive Noise Models (ANM) and
Expectation-Maximization (EM) that unifies physics-guided data imputation with
sparse causal inference. Through kernelized sparse regression and structural
constraints, ReTimeCausal iteratively refines missing values (E-step) and
causal graphs (M-step), resolving cross-frequency dependencies and missing data
issues. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that ReTimeCausal outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods under
challenging irregular sampling and missing data conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: JAX缺乏对混合精度训练的稳健支持，而混合精度训练已成为提升神经网络训练效率的重要工具。

Method: MPX通过将输入和输出转换为半精度，并引入动态损失缩放机制，解决半精度计算中的梯度问题。它还提供自动创建和管理混合精度梯度及优化器的封装。

Abstract: Mixed-precision training has emerged as an indispensable tool for enhancing
the efficiency of neural network training in recent years. Concurrently, JAX
has grown in popularity as a versatile machine learning toolbox. However, it
currently lacks robust support for mixed-precision training. We propose MPX, a
mixed-precision training toolbox for JAX that simplifies and accelerates the
training of large-scale neural networks while preserving model accuracy. MPX
seamlessly integrates with popular toolboxes such as Equinox and Flax, allowing
users to convert full-precision pipelines to mixed-precision versions with
minimal modifications. By casting both inputs and outputs to half precision,
and introducing a dynamic loss-scaling mechanism, MPX alleviates issues like
gradient underflow and overflow that commonly arise in half precision
computations. Its design inherits critical features from JAX's type-promotion
behavior, ensuring that operations take place in the correct precision and
allowing for selective enforcement of full precision where needed (e.g., sums,
means, or softmax). MPX further provides wrappers for automatic creation and
management of mixed-precision gradients and optimizers, enabling
straightforward integration into existing JAX training pipelines. MPX's source
code, documentation, and usage examples are available at

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approaches have been increasingly
applied in drug discovery to learn molecular representations and identify
substructures driving property predictions. However, building end-to-end
explainable machine learning models for structure-activity relationship (SAR)
modeling for compound property prediction faces many challenges, such as
limited activity data per target and the sensitivity of properties to subtle
molecular changes. To address this, we leveraged activity-cliff molecule pairs,
i.e., compounds sharing a common scaffold but differing sharply in potency,
targeting three proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src proteins (i.e., PDB
IDs 1O42, 2H8H, and 4MXO). We implemented graph neural network (GNN) methods to
obtain atom-level feature information and predict compound-protein affinity
(i.e., half maximal inhibitory concentration, IC50). In addition, we trained
GNN models with different structure-aware loss functions to adequately leverage
molecular property and structure information. We also utilized group lasso and
sparse group lasso to prune and highlight molecular subgraphs and enhance the
structure-specific model explainability for the predicted property difference
in molecular activity-cliff pairs. We improved drug property prediction by
integrating common and uncommon node information and using sparse group lasso,
reducing the average root mean squared error (RMSE) by 12.70%, and achieving
the lowest averaged RMSE=0.2551 and the highest PCC=0.9572. Furthermore,
applying regularization enhances feature attribution methods that estimate the
contribution of each atom in the molecular graphs by boosting global direction
scores and atom-level accuracy in atom coloring accuracy, which improves model
interpretability in drug discovery pipelines, particularly in investigating
important molecular substructures in lead optimization.

Motivation: 线性注意力作为软注意力的一种高效近似，尤其在长序列中表现突出。然而，现有方法在所有注意力层中固定特征维度，忽略了不同层的多样性和复杂性。

Method: 利用统计自由度概念自动确定特征维度，并提供理论误差界；同时引入分层训练策略，学习每层的非线性特征。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在固定计算预算下实现了更小的近似误差，且蒸馏模型的性能优于基线。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了模型性能，还揭示了注意力机制在不同层中的复杂性演变。

Abstract: Linear attention has attracted interest as a computationally efficient
approximation to softmax attention, especially for long sequences. Recent
studies have explored distilling softmax attention in pre-trained Transformers
into linear attention. However, a critical challenge remains: how to choose the
feature dimension that governs the approximation quality. Existing methods fix
this dimension uniformly across all attention layers, overlooking the diverse
roles and complexities of them. In this paper, we propose a principled method
to automatically determine the feature dimension in linear attention using the
concept of statistical degrees of freedom, which represent the effective
dimensionality of the inputs. We provide a theoretical bound on the
approximation error and show that the dimension chosen by our method achieves
smaller error under a fixed computational budget. Furthermore, we introduce an
efficient layerwise training strategy to learn nonlinear features tailored to
each layer. Experiments on multiple pre-trained transformers demonstrate that
our method improves the performance of distilled models compared to baselines
without increasing the inference cost. Our findings also provide insight into
how the complexity of the attention mechanism evolves across layers.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in sequential

policies to different perturbations, raising concerns about their effectiveness
and safety in real-world applications. In this work, we focus on the robustness
of RL policies against action perturbations and introduce a novel framework
called Optimal Adversary-aware Policy Iteration (OA-PI). Our framework enhances
action robustness under various perturbations by evaluating and improving
policy performance against the corresponding optimal adversaries. Besides, our
approach can be integrated into mainstream DRL algorithms such as Twin Delayed
DDPG (TD3) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), improving action robustness
effectively while maintaining nominal performance and sample efficiency.
Experimental results across various environments demonstrate that our method
enhances robustness of DRL policies against different action adversaries
effectively.

Abstract: Machine Learning is a diverse field applied across various domains such as
computer science, social sciences, medicine, chemistry, and finance. This
diversity results in varied evaluation approaches, making it difficult to
compare models effectively. Absolute evaluation measures offer a practical
solution by assessing a model's performance on a fixed scale, independent of
reference models and data ranges, enabling explicit comparisons. However, many
commonly used measures are not universally applicable, leading to a lack of
comprehensive guidance on their appropriate use. This survey addresses this gap
by providing an overview of absolute evaluation metrics in ML, organized by the
type of learning problem. While classification metrics have been extensively
studied, this work also covers clustering, regression, and ranking metrics. By
grouping these measures according to the specific ML challenges they address,
this survey aims to equip practitioners with the tools necessary to select
appropriate metrics for their models. The provided overview thus improves
individual model evaluation and facilitates meaningful comparisons across
different models and applications.

Abstract: The $z$-transform of a sequence is a classical tool used within signal
processing, control theory, computer science, and electrical engineering. It
allows for studying sequences from their generating functions, with many
operations that can be equivalently defined on the original sequence and its
$z$-transform. In particular, the $z$-transform method focuses on asymptotic
behaviors and allows the use of Taylor expansions. We present a sequence of
results of increasing significance and difficulty for linear models and
optimization algorithms, demonstrating the effectiveness and versatility of the
$z$-transform method in deriving new asymptotic results. Starting from the
simplest gradient descent iterations in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space,
we show how the spectral dimension characterizes the convergence behavior. We
then extend the analysis to Nesterov acceleration, averaging techniques, and
stochastic gradient descent.

integrates Graph Attention Networks and a novel Graph Transformer to jointly

fingerprints as a complementary modality and introduce a mechanism of
interaction between attention to adaptively fuse information across
representations. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that MLFGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
both classification and regression tasks. Interpretability analysis further
reveals that the model effectively captures task-relevant chemical patterns,
supporting the usefulness of multi-level and multi-modal fusion in molecular

Abstract: The shape of a molecule determines its physicochemical and biological
properties. However, it is often underrepresented in standard molecular
representation learning approaches. Here, we propose using the Euler
Characteristic Transform (ECT) as a geometrical-topological descriptor.
Computed directly on a molecular graph derived from handcrafted atomic
features, the ECT enables the extraction of multiscale structural features,
offering a novel way to represent and encode molecular shape in the feature
space. We assess the predictive performance of this representation across nine
benchmark regression datasets, all centered around predicting the inhibition
constant $K_i$. In addition, we compare our proposed ECT-based representation
against traditional molecular representations and methods, such as molecular
fingerprints/descriptors and graph neural networks (GNNs). Our results show
that our ECT-based representation achieves competitive performance, ranking
among the best-performing methods on several datasets. More importantly, its
combination with traditional representations, particularly with the AVALON
fingerprint, significantly \emph{enhances predictive performance},
outperforming other methods on most datasets. These findings highlight the
complementary value of multiscale topological information and its potential for
being combined with established techniques. Our study suggests that hybrid
approaches incorporating explicit shape information can lead to more
informative and robust molecular representations, enhancing and opening new
avenues in molecular machine learning tasks. To support reproducibility and
foster open biomedical research, we provide open access to all experiments and

the entry barrier for deep RL research by organizing best practices into
explicit, clearly separated components, making them easier to understand and
adapt. Each algorithmic component is a class with attributes that describe key
RL concepts and methods that intuitively reflect their interactions. The class
hierarchy closely follows common ontological relationships, enabling data
encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, which are core features of OOP.
We demonstrate the efficiency of ObjectRL's design through representative use

Abstract: A long-standing problem in online reinforcement learning (RL) is of ensuring
sample efficiency, which stems from an inability to explore environments
efficiently. Most attempts at efficient exploration tackle this problem in a
setting where learning begins from scratch, without prior information available
to bootstrap learning. However, such approaches fail to leverage expert
demonstrations and simulators that can reset to arbitrary states. These
affordances are valuable resources that offer enormous potential to guide
exploration and speed up learning. In this paper, we explore how a small number
of expert demonstrations and a simulator allowing arbitrary resets can
accelerate learning during online RL. We find that training with a suitable
choice of an auxiliary start state distribution that may differ from the true
start state distribution of the underlying Markov Decision Process can
significantly improve sample efficiency. We find that using a notion of safety
to inform the choice of this auxiliary distribution significantly accelerates
learning. By using episode length information as a way to operationalize this
notion, we demonstrate state-of-the-art sample efficiency on a sparse-reward
hard-exploration environment.

TL;DR: MAFG框架通过多智能体协作和强化学习自动化特征生成，显著提升科学数据挖掘任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征生成方法依赖领域知识且搜索空间大，MAFG利用DCAI范式自动化解决这些问题。

Method: MAFG结合多智能体协作构建数学变换方程，强化学习优化策略，并利用LLM解释评估特征。

Result: 实验证明MAFG能有效自动化特征生成并提升下游任务性能。

Conclusion: MAFG为科学数据特征生成提供了高效自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Feature generation (FG) aims to enhance the prediction potential of original
data by constructing high-order feature combinations and removing redundant
features. It is a key preprocessing step for tabular scientific data to improve
downstream machine-learning model performance. Traditional methods face the
following two challenges when dealing with the feature generation of scientific
data: First, the effective construction of high-order feature combinations in
scientific data necessitates profound and extensive domain-specific expertise.
Secondly, as the order of feature combinations increases, the search space
expands exponentially, imposing prohibitive human labor consumption.
Advancements in the Data-Centric Artificial Intelligence (DCAI) paradigm have
opened novel avenues for automating feature generation processes. Inspired by
that, this paper revisits the conventional feature generation workflow and
proposes the Multi-agent Feature Generation (MAFG) framework. Specifically, in
the iterative exploration stage, multi-agents will construct mathematical
transformation equations collaboratively, synthesize and identify feature
combinations ex-hibiting high information content, and leverage a reinforcement
learning mechanism to evolve their strategies. Upon completing the exploration
phase, MAFG integrates the large language models (LLMs) to interpreta-tively
evaluate the generated features of each significant model performance
breakthrough. Experimental results and case studies consistently demonstrate
that the MAFG framework effectively automates the feature generation process
and significantly enhances various downstream scientific data mining tasks.

Motivation: 传统方法对所有网络层使用统一学习率，可能忽略了各部分的独特动态性，因此需要一种更灵活的学习率调整方法。

Method: 引入相对学习率（RLRS）方法，针对不同组件动态调整学习率，超参数可从小模型高效调优并迁移到大模型。

Result: RLRS在复杂模型（如MoE）中训练速度提升高达23%，且适用于比小模型大27倍的模型。

Conclusion: RLRS是一种简单有效的方法，显著减少训练时间和计算资源，为大规模神经网络优化提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a novel approach for optimizing LLM training by
adjusting learning rates across weights of different components in Transformer
models. Traditional methods often apply a uniform learning rate across all
network layers, potentially overlooking the unique dynamics of each part.
Remarkably, our introduced relative learning rates, RLRS, method accelerates
the training process by up to $23\%$, particularly in complex models such as
Mixture of Experts (MoE). Hyperparameters of RLRS can be efficiently tuned on
smaller models and then effectively reused on models up to $27\times$ larger.
This simple and effective method results in a substantial reduction in training
time and computational resources, offering a practical and scalable solution
for optimizing large-scale neural networks.

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data generation has received increasing attention in recent
years, particularly with the emergence of foundation models for tabular data.
The breakthrough success of TabPFN (Hollmann et al.,2025), which leverages vast
quantities of synthetic tabular datasets derived from structural causal models
(SCMs), demonstrates the critical role synthetic data plays in developing
powerful tabular foundation models. However, most real-world tabular data
exists in relational formats spanning multiple interconnected tables - a
structure not adequately addressed by current generation methods. In this work,
we extend the SCM-based approach by developing a novel framework that generates
realistic synthetic relational tabular data including causal relationships
across tables. Our experiments confirm that this framework is able to construct
relational datasets with complex inter-table dependencies mimicking real-world
scenarios.

Conclusion: 世界模型的主要目标是模拟现实世界中所有可操作的可能性，以支持有目的的推理和行动，本文提出的架构为实现这一目标提供了新思路。

Abstract: World Model, the supposed algorithmic surrogate of the real-world environment
which biological agents experience with and act upon, has been an emerging
topic in recent years because of the rising needs to develop virtual agents
with artificial (general) intelligence. There has been much debate on what a
world model really is, how to build it, how to use it, and how to evaluate it.
In this essay, starting from the imagination in the famed Sci-Fi classic Dune,
and drawing inspiration from the concept of "hypothetical thinking" in
psychology literature, we offer critiques of several schools of thoughts on
world modeling, and argue the primary goal of a world model to be simulating
all actionable possibilities of the real world for purposeful reasoning and
acting. Building on the critiques, we propose a new architecture for a
general-purpose world model, based on hierarchical, multi-level, and mixed
continuous/discrete representations, and a generative and self-supervision
learning framework, with an outlook of a Physical, Agentic, and Nested (PAN)
AGI system enabled by such a model.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习中高维梯度传输和差分隐私噪声随维度增长的问题。

Method: 使用紧凑草图将梯度投影到低维子空间，并添加随机探针防止草图退化。

Result: 通信成本从d降到k，梯度近似误差为σ²k，满足(ε,δ)-差分隐私。

Conclusion: DOME有效降低了通信和噪声成本，同时确保隐私保护。

Abstract: Federated learning with differential privacy suffers from two major costs:
each client must transmit $d$-dimensional gradients every round, and the
magnitude of DP noise grows with $d$. Yet empirical studies show that gradient
updates exhibit strong temporal correlations and lie in a $k$-dimensional
subspace with $k \ll d$. Motivated by this, we introduce DOME, a decentralized
DP optimization framework in which each client maintains a compact sketch to
project gradients into $\mathbb{R}^k$ before privatization and Secure
Aggregation. This reduces per-round communication from order $d$ to order $k$
and moves towards a gradient approximation mean-squared error of $\sigma^2 k$.
To allow the sketch to span new directions and prevent it from collapsing onto
historical gradients, we augment it with random probes orthogonal to historical
directions. We prove that our overall protocol satisfies
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-Differential Privacy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图神经正切核（GNTK）的层堆叠策略引入了冗余计算，增加了计算复杂度，限制了实际应用的可扩展性。

Method: SGTK用连续的$K$-步聚合操作替代多层堆叠机制，SGNK将无限宽图神经网络建模为高斯过程，直接从激活函数的期望输出确定核值。

Result: 在节点和图分类任务中，SGTK和SGNK性能与现有方法相当，但计算效率更高。

Conclusion: SGTK和SGNK通过简化计算过程，显著提高了效率，同时保持了表达能力，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: The Graph Neural Tangent Kernel (GNTK) successfully bridges the gap between
kernel methods and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), addressing key challenges such
as the difficulty of training deep networks and the limitations of traditional
kernel methods. However, the existing layer-stacking strategy in GNTK
introduces redundant computations, significantly increasing computational
complexity and limiting scalability for practical applications. To address
these issues, this paper proposes the Simplified Graph Neural Tangent Kernel
(SGTK), which replaces the traditional multi-layer stacking mechanism with a
continuous $K$-step aggregation operation. This novel approach streamlines the
iterative kernel computation process, effectively eliminating redundant
calculations while preserving the kernel's expressiveness. By reducing the
dependency on layer stacking, SGTK achieves both computational simplicity and
efficiency. Furthermore, we introduce the Simplified Graph Neural Kernel
(SGNK), which models infinitely wide Graph Neural Networks as Gaussian
Processes. This allows kernel values to be directly determined from the
expected outputs of activation functions in the infinite-width regime,
bypassing the need for explicit layer-by-layer computation. SGNK further
reduces computational complexity while maintaining the capacity to capture
intricate structural patterns in graphs. Extensive experiments on node and
graph classification tasks demonstrate that the proposed SGTK and SGNK achieve
performance comparable to existing approaches while improving computational
efficiency. Implementation details are available at

Conclusion: KLDM为晶体材料生成提供了一种有效的方法，特别适用于处理周期性对称性。

Abstract: Generative modeling of crystalline materials using diffusion models presents
a series of challenges: the data distribution is characterized by inherent
symmetries and involves multiple modalities, with some defined on specific
manifolds. Notably, the treatment of fractional coordinates representing atomic
positions in the unit cell requires careful consideration, as they lie on a
hypertorus. In this work, we introduce Kinetic Langevin Diffusion for Materials
(KLDM), a novel diffusion model for crystalline materials generation, where the
key innovation resides in the modeling of the coordinates. Instead of resorting
to Riemannian diffusion on the hypertorus directly, we generalize Trivialized
Diffusion Model (TDM) to account for the symmetries inherent to crystals. By
coupling coordinates with auxiliary Euclidean variables representing
velocities, the diffusion process is now offset to a flat space. This allows us
to effectively perform diffusion on the hypertorus while providing a training
objective that accounts for the periodic translation symmetry of the true data
distribution. We evaluate KLDM on both Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) and
De-novo Generation (DNG) tasks, demonstrating its competitive performance with
current state-of-the-art models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险应用中，需要可靠的点预测和可解释的不确定性量化，以准确估计个体治疗效果。

Method: 采用因子化蒙特卡洛Dropout框架，将总预测方差分解为共享编码器中的表示不确定性（sigma_rep）和结果头中的预测不确定性（sigma_pred）。

Result: 在合成协变量偏移场景下，区间校准良好（ECE < 0.03），且满足sigma_rep^2 + sigma_pred^2 ~ sigma_tot^2。在真实数据中，表示不确定性在分布外样本中显著增加。

Conclusion: 模块级分解为深度因果效应模型中的不确定性来源检测和解释提供了实用诊断工具。

Abstract: Accurate individual treatment-effect estimation in high-stakes applications
demands both reliable point predictions and interpretable uncertainty
quantification. We propose a factorized Monte Carlo Dropout framework for deep
twin-network models that splits total predictive variance into representation
uncertainty (sigma_rep) in the shared encoder and prediction uncertainty
(sigma_pred) in the outcome heads. Across three synthetic covariate-shift
regimes, our intervals are well-calibrated (ECE < 0.03) and satisfy sigma_rep^2
+ sigma_pred^2 ~ sigma_tot^2. Additionally, we observe a crossover: head
uncertainty leads on in-distribution data, but representation uncertainty
dominates under shift. Finally, on a real-world twins cohort with induced
multivariate shifts, only sigma_rep spikes on out-of-distribution samples
(delta sigma ~ 0.0002) and becomes the primary error predictor (rho_rep <=
0.89), while sigma_pred remains flat. This module-level decomposition offers a
practical diagnostic for detecting and interpreting uncertainty sources in deep
causal-effect models.

Conclusion: PEM-UDE为多尺度脑模型提供新途径，连接单神经元动态和宏观脑活动。

Abstract: Discovering governing equations that describe complex chaotic systems remains
a fundamental challenge in physics and neuroscience. Here, we introduce the
PEM-UDE method, which combines the prediction-error method with universal
differential equations to extract interpretable mathematical expressions from
chaotic dynamical systems, even with limited or noisy observations. This
approach succeeds where traditional techniques fail by smoothing optimization
landscapes and removing the chaotic properties during the fitting process
without distorting optimal parameters. We demonstrate its efficacy by
recovering hidden states in the Rossler system and reconstructing dynamics from
noise-corrupted electrical circuit data, where the correct functional form of
the dynamics is recovered even when one of the observed time series is
corrupted by noise 5x the magnitude of the true signal. We demonstrate that
this method is capable of recovering the correct dynamics, whereas direct
symbolic regression methods, such as SINDy, fail to do so with the given amount
of data and noise. Importantly, when applied to neural populations, our method
derives novel governing equations that respect biological constraints such as
network sparsity - a constraint necessary for cortical information processing
yet not captured in next-generation neural mass models - while preserving
microscale neuronal parameters. These equations predict an emergent
relationship between connection density and both oscillation frequency and
synchrony in neural circuits. We validate these predictions using three
intracranial electrode recording datasets from the medial entorhinal cortex,
prefrontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex. Our work provides a pathway to
develop mechanistic, multi-scale brain models that generalize across diverse
neural architectures, bridging the gap between single-neuron dynamics and
macroscale brain activity.

Abstract: Inconsistencies between clinical and omics data may arise within medical
cohorts. The identification, annotation and explanation of anomalous
omics-based patients or individuals may become crucial to better reshape the
disease, e.g., by detecting early onsets signaled by the omics and undetectable
from observable symptoms. Here, we developed MLASDO (Machine Learning based
Anomalous Sample Detection on Omics), a new method and software tool to
identify, characterize and automatically describe anomalous samples based on
omics data. Its workflow is based on three steps: (1) classification of healthy
and cases individuals using a support vector machine algorithm; (2) detection
of anomalous samples within groups; (3) explanation of anomalous individuals
based on clinical data and expert knowledge. We showcase MLASDO using
transcriptomics data of 317 healthy controls (HC) and 465 Parkinson's disease
(PD) cases from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. In this cohort,
MLASDO detected 15 anomalous HC with a PD-like transcriptomic signature and
PD-like clinical features, including a lower proportion of CD4/CD8 naive
T-cells and CD4 memory T-cells compared to HC (P<3.5*10^-3). MLASDO also
identified 22 anomalous PD cases with a transcriptomic signature more similar
to that of HC and some clinical features more similar to HC, including a lower
proportion of mature neutrophils compared to PD cases (P<6*10^-3). In summary,
MLASDO is a powerful tool that can help the clinician to detect and explain
anomalous HC and cases of interest to be followed up. MLASDO is an open-source
R package available at: https://github.com/JoseAdrian3/MLASDO.

Abstract: Scientific applications increasingly demand real-time surrogate models that
can capture the behavior of strongly coupled multiphysics systems driven by
multiple input functions, such as in thermo-mechanical and electro-thermal
processes. While neural operator frameworks, such as Deep Operator Networks
(DeepONets), have shown considerable success in single-physics settings, their
extension to multiphysics problems remains poorly understood. In particular,
the challenge of learning nonlinear interactions between tightly coupled
physical fields has received little systematic attention. This study addresses
a foundational question: should the architectural design of a neural operator
reflect the strength of physical coupling it aims to model? To answer this, we
present the first comprehensive, architecture-aware evaluation of DeepONet
variants across three regimes: single-physics, weakly coupled, and strongly
coupled multiphysics systems. We consider a reaction-diffusion equation with
dual spatial inputs, a nonlinear thermo-electrical problem with bidirectional
coupling through temperature-dependent conductivity, and a viscoplastic
thermo-mechanical model of steel solidification governed by transient
phase-driven interactions. Two operator-learning frameworks, the classical
DeepONet and its sequential GRU-based extension, S-DeepONet, are benchmarked
using both single-branch and multi-branch (MIONet-style) architectures. Our
results demonstrate that architectural alignment with physical coupling is
crucial: single-branch networks significantly outperform multi-branch
counterparts in strongly coupled settings, whereas multi-branch encodings offer
advantages for decoupled or single-physics problems. Once trained, these
surrogates achieve full-field predictions up to 1.8e4 times faster than
high-fidelity finite-element solvers, without compromising solution accuracy.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM对齐机制的脆弱性，强调了需要更鲁棒的微调策略以保持跨领域的安全性。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on code
with security vulnerabilities can result in misaligned and unsafe behaviors
across broad domains. These results prompted concerns about the emergence of
harmful behaviors from narrow domain fine-tuning. In this paper, we
contextualize these findings by analyzing how such narrow adaptation impacts
the internal mechanisms and behavioral manifestations of LLMs. Through a series
of experiments covering output probability distributions, loss and gradient
vector geometry, layer-wise activation dynamics, and activation space
dimensions, we find that behaviors attributed to "emergent misalignment" may be
better interpreted as an erosion of prior alignment. We show that fine tuning
on insecure code induces internal changes that oppose alignment. Further, we
identify a shared latent dimension in the model's activation space that governs
alignment behavior. We show that this space is activated by insecure code and
by misaligned responses more generally, revealing how narrow fine-tuning can
degrade general safety behavior by interfering with shared internal mechanisms.
Our findings offer a mechanistic interpretation for previously observed
misalignment phenomena, and highlights the fragility of alignment in LLMs. The
results underscore the need for more robust fine-tuning strategies that
preserve intended behavior across domains.

Abstract: Accurate electricity consumption forecasting is crucial for ensuring grid
stability and optimizing power generation, particularly in increasingly
decentralized and complex systems. While classical approaches such as
Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) remain widely used, they often fail to
capture the spatial dependencies inherent in energy networks. Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) offer a principled framework to incorporate this structure by
directly leveraging graph topologies. In this work, we evaluate a broad set of
GNN architectures -- including GCN, GraphSAGE, ChebConv, TAG, APPNP,
TransformerConv, and Graph Attention Networks (GAT and GATv2) -- on two
real-world electricity consumption datasets from France and the UK. Our
experiments show that while complex architectures like GATv2 and
TransformerConv do not consistently outperform their simpler counterparts,
models such as GCN and APPNP achieve strong results in low-data or highly
disaggregated settings. Nonetheless, the vanilla GAT remains highly competitive
across both datasets and offers an additional interpretability layer via
attention mechanisms. We perform a temporal analysis of attention weights,
revealing evolving patterns of regional interaction linked to seasonal and
meteorological variability. These results highlight that, although attention is
not universally superior, it provides valuable explanatory power when spatial
dependencies are prominent. Finally, we benchmark ensemble-based expert
aggregation strategies, showing that uniform or learned combinations can
enhance robustness and outperform individual models under data heterogeneity.

Abstract: Cosmological simulations provide a wealth of data in the form of point clouds
and directed trees. A crucial goal is to extract insights from this data that
shed light on the nature and composition of the Universe. In this paper we
introduce CosmoBench, a benchmark dataset curated from state-of-the-art
cosmological simulations whose runs required more than 41 million core-hours
and generated over two petabytes of data. CosmoBench is the largest dataset of
its kind: it contains 34 thousand point clouds from simulations of dark matter
halos and galaxies at three different length scales, as well as 25 thousand
directed trees that record the formation history of halos on two different time
scales. The data in CosmoBench can be used for multiple tasks -- to predict
cosmological parameters from point clouds and merger trees, to predict the
velocities of individual halos and galaxies from their collective positions,
and to reconstruct merger trees on finer time scales from those on coarser time
scales. We provide several baselines on these tasks, some based on established
approaches from cosmological modeling and others rooted in machine learning.
For the latter, we study different approaches -- from simple linear models that
are minimally constrained by symmetries to much larger and more
computationally-demanding models in deep learning, such as graph neural
networks. We find that least-squares fits with a handful of invariant features
sometimes outperform deep architectures with many more parameters and far
longer training times. Still there remains tremendous potential to improve
these baselines by combining machine learning and cosmology to fully exploit
the data. CosmoBench sets the stage for bridging cosmology and geometric deep
learning at scale. We invite the community to push the frontier of scientific
discovery by engaging with this dataset, available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究探讨了如何利用AI模型克服传统Critical Factor Assessment (CFA)工具的限制，通过LLM提取特征并训练机器学习模型，显著提高了预测天使投资决策的准确性和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期科技初创企业依赖外部资金，但天使投资决策主观且耗时。传统CFA工具虽准确但效率低，限制了其广泛应用。

Method: 使用LLM为600个初创企业路演文本分配CFA因素，并以此训练机器学习分类模型。

Result: 最佳模型预测准确率达85%，与人工评估显著相关（Spearman's r = 0.896）。

Conclusion: AI与CFA结合提供了可扩展、可靠且无偏的初创企业评估方法，解决了传统工具的局限性。

Abstract: External funding is crucial for early-stage ventures, particularly technology
startups that require significant R&D investment. Business angels offer a
critical source of funding, but their decision-making is often subjective and
resource-intensive for both investor and entrepreneur. Much research has
investigated this investment process to find the critical factors angels
consider. One such tool, the Critical Factor Assessment (CFA), deployed more
than 20,000 times by the Canadian Innovation Centre, has been evaluated
post-decision and found to be significantly more accurate than investors' own
decisions. However, a single CFA analysis requires three trained individuals
and several days, limiting its adoption. This study builds on previous work
validating the CFA to investigate whether the constraints inhibiting its
adoption can be overcome using a trained AI model. In this research, we
prompted multiple large language models (LLMs) to assign the eight CFA factors
to a dataset of 600 transcribed, unstructured startup pitches seeking business
angel funding with known investment outcomes. We then trained and evaluated
machine learning classification models using the LLM-generated CFA scores as
input features. Our best-performing model demonstrated high predictive accuracy
(85.0% for predicting BA deal/no-deal outcomes) and exhibited significant
correlation (Spearman's r = 0.896, p-value < 0.001) with conventional
human-graded evaluations. The integration of AI-based feature extraction with a
structured and validated decision-making framework yielded a scalable,
reliable, and less-biased model for evaluating startup pitches, removing the
constraints that previously limited adoption.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FAROS是一个新颖的公平图生成框架，通过在预训练的图扩散模型生成过程中直接切换节点敏感属性，优化公平性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过重新训练图扩散模型来缓解偏见，但FAROS直接在生成过程中优化公平性，避免了重新训练的开销。

Method: FAROS通过计算最优切换节点比例，并在扩散步骤中切换敏感属性，同时设置多标准约束以保持节点拓扑分布和边缘独立性。

Result: 实验表明，FAROS在减少公平性差异的同时保持了准确性，并在某些情况下优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: FAROS通过多标准约束在公平性和准确性之间取得了更好的平衡，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in graph diffusion models (GDMs) have enabled the
synthesis of realistic network structures, yet ensuring fairness in the
generated data remains a critical challenge. Existing solutions attempt to
mitigate bias by re-training the GDMs with ad-hoc fairness constraints.
Conversely, with this work, we propose FAROS, a novel FAir graph geneRatiOn
framework leveraging attribute Switching mechanisms and directly running in the
generation process of the pre-trained GDM. Technically, our approach works by
altering nodes' sensitive attributes during the generation. To this end, FAROS
calculates the optimal fraction of switching nodes, and selects the diffusion
step to perform the switch by setting tailored multi-criteria constraints to
preserve the node-topology profile from the original distribution (a proxy for
accuracy) while ensuring the edge independence on the sensitive attributes for
the generated graph (a proxy for fairness). Our experiments on benchmark
datasets for link prediction demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively
reduces fairness discrepancies while maintaining comparable (or even higher)
accuracy performance to other similar baselines. Noteworthy, FAROS is also able
to strike a better accuracy-fairness trade-off than other competitors in some
of the tested settings under the Pareto optimality concept, demonstrating the
effectiveness of the imposed multi-criteria constraints.

*Magda Dubois,Harry Coppock,Mario Giulianelli,Lennart Luettgau,Cozmin Ududec*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于贝叶斯广义线性模型（GLMs）的统计框架，用于评估LLM自动评分器（autograders）的可靠性并检测其潜在偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM自动评分器虽然提供了可扩展的评估方式，但其可靠性和系统性偏差问题尚未解决。

Method: 使用贝叶斯广义线性模型，将评分结果建模为评分器和被评分项属性的函数，量化评分差异和偏差。

Result: 该方法能够同时评估自动评分器的性能并检测偏差，提供不确定性估计和分歧来源分析。

Conclusion: 该框架增强了LLM自动评分器的稳健性和可解释性，支持性能分析和偏差检测。

Abstract: The evaluation of large language model (LLM) outputs is increasingly
performed by other LLMs, a setup commonly known as "LLM-as-a-judge", or
autograders. While autograders offer a scalable alternative to human
evaluation, they have shown mixed reliability and may exhibit systematic
biases, depending on response type, scoring methodology, domain specificity,
and other factors. In this paper we propose a statistical framework based on
Bayesian generalised linear models (GLMs) that enables researchers to
simultaneously assess their autograders while also addressing their primary
research questions (e.g., LLM evaluation). Our approach models evaluation
outcomes (e.g., scores or pairwise preferences) as a function of properties of
the grader (e.g., human vs. autograder) and the evaluated item (e.g., response
length or the LLM that generated it), allowing for explicit quantification of
scoring differences and potential biases within a unified framework. In
addition, our method can be used to augment traditional reliability metrics
such as inter-rater agreement, by providing uncertainty estimates and
clarifying the source of disagreement. Overall, this approach contributes to
more robust and interpretable use of autograders in LLM evaluation, enabling
both performance analysis and bias detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLSI设计流程中，静态时序分析是关键环节，但时序分析依赖于布局和布线，而布局和布线的效率又受最终时序性能影响。因此，需要一种高效的时序相关预测方法。

Method: 采用GNN（图神经网络）技术，提出GNN-Ceff模型，利用GPU并行化实现高速计算。

Result: GNN-Ceff在真实基准测试中实现了929倍的速度提升，且精度优于现有启发式方法。

Conclusion: GNN-Ceff为VLSI设计流程提供了一种高效且准确的有效电容建模方法。

Abstract: Static timing analysis is a crucial stage in the VLSI design flow that
verifies the timing correctness of circuits. Timing analysis depends on the
placement and routing of the design, but at the same time, placement and
routing efficiency depend on the final timing performance. VLSI design flows
can benefit from timing-related prediction to better perform the earlier stages
of the design flow. Effective capacitance is an essential input for gate delay
calculation, and finding exact values requires routing or routing estimates. In
this work, we propose the first GNN-based post-layout effective capacitance
modeling method, GNN-Ceff, that achieves significant speed gains due to GPU
parallelization while also providing better accuracy than current heuristics.
GNN-Ceff parallelization achieves 929x speedup on real-life benchmarks over the
state-of-the-art method run serially.

*Md Mokarram Chowdhury,Daniel Agyei Asante,Ernie Chang,Yang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IMPACT框架通过重要性感知的激活重建优化低秩压缩，显著减少LLM模型大小同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在资源受限环境中部署困难，传统低秩权重压缩假设不适用于LLM，而激活的低秩结构更强。

Method: 提出IMPACT框架，结合激活结构和梯度敏感性，通过重要性加权激活协方差矩阵的特征向量优化低秩近似。

Result: 实验表明，IMPACT在多种模型和任务中实现高达48.6%的模型大小减少，准确性接近最优基线。

Conclusion: IMPACT通过重要性感知的激活重建，为LLM压缩提供了更有效的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across many domains
but are difficult to deploy in resource-constrained settings due to their size.
Low-rank weight matrix compression is a popular strategy for reducing model
size, typically by minimizing weight reconstruction error under the assumption
that weights are low-rank. However, this assumption often does not hold in
LLMs. Instead, LLM activations exhibit stronger low-rank structure-prompting a
shift toward minimizing activation reconstruction error.
  We show that this shift alone is insufficient: activation dimensions
contribute unequally to model performance, and uniform reconstruction can harm
performance. We propose IMPACT, a principled framework for importance-aware
activation reconstruction that links model compression decisions to their
impact on model behavior. IMPACT formulates an optimization problem that
considers both activation structure and gradient sensitivity, and derives a
closed-form solution where the optimal reconstruction bases are the
eigenvectors of an importance-weighted activation covariance matrix. This
enables low-rank approximations explicitly optimized to preserve accuracy.
Experiments across diverse models and tasks show that IMPACT achieves up to
48.6% greater model size reduction with accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art
baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的框架MatRL，用于自动发现计算矩阵函数的迭代算法，通过蒙特卡洛树搜索优化算法序列和步长，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统迭代方法需要手动调参且性能优化复杂，现代计算环境中存在多种迭代变体，设计高效算法具有挑战性。

Method: 将算法设计视为序列决策问题，利用蒙特卡洛树搜索生成针对特定输入矩阵分布和计算环境的混合迭代序列。

Result: MatRL生成的算法在数值实验中优于文献中的基线方法，并能推广到同一分布下的大规模矩阵。

Conclusion: MatRL通过自动化算法设计，显著提升了矩阵函数计算的效率和性能。

Abstract: Iterative methods for computing matrix functions have been extensively
studied and their convergence speed can be significantly improved with the
right tuning of parameters and by mixing different iteration types. Handtuning
the design options for optimal performance can be cumbersome, especially in
modern computing environments: numerous different classical iterations and
their variants exist, each with non-trivial per-step cost and tuning
parameters. To this end, we propose MatRL -- a reinforcement learning based
framework that automatically discovers iterative algorithms for computing
matrix functions. The key idea is to treat algorithm design as a sequential
decision-making process. Monte-Carlo tree search is then used to plan a hybrid
sequence of matrix iterations and step sizes, tailored to a specific input
matrix distribution and computing environment. Moreover, we also show that the
learned algorithms provably generalize to sufficiently large matrices drawn
from the same distribution. Finally, we corroborate our theoretical results
with numerical experiments demonstrating that MatRL produces algorithms that
outperform various baselines in the literature.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种分布式eGNN实现，通过GPU直接通信和图分区策略，解决了大规模电子结构预测中的内存限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用eGNN预测电子结构时，由于原子轨道间相互作用范围广，图表示密集连接，导致内存需求超出GPU限制。

Method: 采用分布式eGNN实现，结合GPU直接通信和图分区策略，减少GPU间嵌入交换。

Result: 在Alps超级计算机上，实现了128 GPU的强扩展和512 GPU的弱扩展，并行效率达87%，适用于3,000至190,000原子的结构。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了大规模电子结构预测中的计算资源限制问题，为研究扩展缺陷、界面或无序相材料提供了可能。

Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (eGNNs) trained on density-functional
theory (DFT) data can potentially perform electronic structure prediction at
unprecedented scales, enabling investigation of the electronic properties of
materials with extended defects, interfaces, or exhibiting disordered phases.
However, as interactions between atomic orbitals typically extend over 10+
angstroms, the graph representations required for this task tend to be densely
connected, and the memory requirements to perform training and inference on
these large structures can exceed the limits of modern GPUs. Here we present a
distributed eGNN implementation which leverages direct GPU communication and
introduce a partitioning strategy of the input graph to reduce the number of
embedding exchanges between GPUs. Our implementation shows strong scaling up to
128 GPUs, and weak scaling up to 512 GPUs with 87% parallel efficiency for
structures with 3,000 to 190,000 atoms on the Alps supercomputer.

*Chi-Ken Lu,David Alonge,Nicole Richardson,Bruno Richard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过减少ICD-10代码的粒度，在保持模型可解释性和一致性的同时，提高OLS回归的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高维回归中ICD-10代码不稳定和稀疏性问题，同时保持模型的可解释性和准确性。

Method: 将ICD-10代码从七字符截断为六字符或更少，降低回归问题的维度。

Result: 减少代码粒度提高了系数估计的稳定性，解释了为何实际应用中更倾向于使用较宽泛的诊断分组。

Conclusion: 减少ICD-10代码的粒度是一种有效的正则化策略，适用于需要平衡可解释性、准确性和一致性的医疗成本模型。

Abstract: Cost models in healthcare research must balance interpretability, accuracy,
and parameter consistency. However, interpretable models often struggle to
achieve both accuracy and consistency. Ordinary least squares (OLS) models for
high-dimensional regression can be accurate but fail to produce stable
regression coefficients over time when using highly granular ICD-10 diagnostic
codes as predictors. This instability arises because many ICD-10 codes are
infrequent in healthcare datasets. While regularization methods such as Ridge
can address this issue, they risk discarding important predictors. Here, we
demonstrate that reducing the granularity of ICD-10 codes is an effective
regularization strategy within OLS while preserving the representation of all
diagnostic code categories. By truncating ICD-10 codes from seven characters
(e.g., T67.0XXA, T67.0XXD) to six (e.g., T67.0XX) or fewer, we reduce the
dimensionality of the regression problem while maintaining model
interpretability and consistency. Mathematically, the merging of predictors in
OLS leads to increased trace of the Hessian matrix, which reduces the variance
of coefficient estimation. Our findings explain why broader diagnostic
groupings like DRGs and HCC codes are favored over highly granular ICD-10 codes
in real-world risk adjustment and cost models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently generate hallucinations: statements
that are syntactically plausible but lack factual grounding. This research
presents KEA (Kernel-Enriched AI) Explain: a neurosymbolic framework that
detects and explains such hallucinations by comparing knowledge graphs
constructed from LLM outputs with ground truth data from Wikidata or contextual
documents. Using graph kernels and semantic clustering, the method provides
explanations for detected hallucinations, ensuring both robustness and
interpretability. Our framework achieves competitive accuracy in detecting
hallucinations across both open- and closed-domain tasks, and is able to

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在量子化学中主要局限于中性、闭壳分子，而现实化学系统通常具有复杂特性（如电荷、自旋和环境变化）。

Method: OrbitAll结合了自旋极化轨道特征和图神经网络（SE(3)-等变），能够处理任意电荷、自旋和环境效应的分子系统。

Result: OrbitAll在预测带电、开壳和溶剂化分子方面表现优异，且能泛化到比训练数据大得多的分子，同时训练数据需求仅为竞争AI模型的1/10，速度比密度泛函理论快10^3-10^4倍。

Conclusion: OrbitAll通过物理启发的架构，实现了对复杂分子系统的高效表示和预测，显著提升了量子化学深度学习的适用性和效率。

Abstract: Despite the success of deep learning methods in quantum chemistry, their
representational capacity is most often confined to neutral, closed-shell
molecules. However, real-world chemical systems often exhibit complex
characteristics, including varying charges, spins, and environments. We
introduce OrbitAll, a geometry- and physics-informed deep learning framework
that can represent all molecular systems with electronic structure information.
OrbitAll utilizes spin-polarized orbital features from the underlying quantum
mechanical method, and combines it with graph neural networks satisfying
SE(3)-equivariance. The resulting framework can represent and process any
molecular system with arbitrary charges, spins, and environmental effects.
OrbitAll demonstrates superior performance and generalization on predicting
charged, open-shell, and solvated molecules, while also robustly extrapolating
to molecules significantly larger than the training data by leveraging a
physics-informed architecture. OrbitAll achieves chemical accuracy using 10
times fewer training data than competing AI models, with a speedup of
approximately $10^3$ - $10^4$ compared to density functional theory.

TL;DR: TK-GCN是一个两阶段框架，用于不规则几何域上的时空动态预测，结合了几何感知的空间编码和长程时间建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决不规则几何域上复杂空间相关性和非线性时间动态的联合建模难题。

Method: 第一阶段使用Koopman增强的图卷积网络（K-GCN）将高维动态嵌入近似线性的潜在空间；第二阶段用Transformer模块建模潜在空间中的时间进展。

Result: 在心脏时空动态预测中，TK-GCN表现优于现有基准，预测准确性高。

Conclusion: TK-GCN能有效建模复杂空间结构和非线性时间动态，适用于长程预测。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal dynamics forecasting is inherently challenging, particularly
in systems defined over irregular geometric domains, due to the need to jointly
capture complex spatial correlations and nonlinear temporal dynamics. To tackle
these challenges, we propose TK-GCN, a two-stage framework that integrates
geometry-aware spatial encoding with long-range temporal modeling. In the first
stage, a Koopman-enhanced Graph Convolutional Network (K-GCN) is developed to
embed the high-dimensional dynamics distributed on spatially irregular domains
into a latent space where the evolution of system states is approximately
linear. By leveraging Koopman operator theory, this stage enhances the temporal
consistency during the latent learning. In the second stage, a Transformer
module is employed to model the temporal progression within the Koopman-encoded
latent space. Through the self-attention mechanism, the Transformer captures
long-range temporal dependencies, enabling accurate forecasting over extended
horizons. We evaluate TK-GCN in spatiotemporal cardiac dynamics forecasting and
benchmark its performance against several state-of-the-art baselines.
Experimental results and ablation studies show that TK-GCN consistently
delivers superior predictive accuracy across a range of forecast horizons,
demonstrating its capability to effectively model complex spatial structures
and nonlinear temporal dynamics.

Conclusion: 高阶PINNs为ODE问题的解决提供了更准确的模型，尤其在参数和初始条件变化的情况下表现优异。

Abstract: We study the problem of learning neural network models for Ordinary
Differential Equations (ODEs) with parametric uncertainties. Such neural
network models capture the solution to the ODE over a given set of parameters,
initial conditions, and range of times. Physics-Informed Neural Networks
(PINNs) have emerged as a promising approach for learning such models that
combine data-driven deep learning with symbolic physics models in a principled
manner. However, the accuracy of PINNs degrade when they are used to solve an
entire family of initial value problems characterized by varying parameters and
initial conditions.
  In this paper, we combine symbolic differentiation and Taylor series methods
to propose a class of higher-order models for capturing the solutions to ODEs.
These models combine neural networks and symbolic terms: they use higher order
Lie derivatives and a Taylor series expansion obtained symbolically, with the
remainder term modeled as a neural network. The key insight is that the
remainder term can itself be modeled as a solution to a first-order ODE. We
show how the use of these higher order PINNs can improve accuracy using
interesting, but challenging ODE benchmarks. We also show that the resulting
model can be quite useful for situations such as controlling uncertain physical
systems modeled as ODEs.

Motivation: 传统PDE数值求解器计算成本高，而ML代理模型在自回归推理中误差累积严重，限制了长期预测的准确性。

Method: 采用深度集成框架，训练多个随机初始化的ML模型，并在推理时聚合预测结果，以减少误差传播。

Result: 在三个PDE驱动的动态系统中验证，显著减少了误差累积，且推理时间远快于数值求解器。

Conclusion: 深度集成方法在多种物理系统中表现出鲁棒性，是传统求解器的高效准确替代方案。

Abstract: Systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) require
computationally intensive numerical solvers to predict spatiotemporal field
evolution. While machine learning (ML) surrogates offer faster solutions,
autoregressive inference with ML models suffer from error accumulation over
successive predictions, limiting their long-term accuracy. We propose a deep
ensemble framework to address this challenge, where multiple ML surrogate
models with random weight initializations are trained in parallel and
aggregated during inference. This approach leverages the diversity of model
predictions to mitigate error propagation while retaining the autoregressive
strategies ability to capture the system's time dependent relations. We
validate the framework on three PDE-driven dynamical systems - stress evolution
in heterogeneous microstructures, Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion, and
planetary-scale shallow water system - demonstrating consistent reduction in
error accumulation over time compared to individual models. Critically, the
method requires only a few time steps as input, enabling full trajectory
predictions with inference times significantly faster than numerical solvers.
Our results highlight the robustness of ensemble methods in diverse physical
systems and their potential as efficient and accurate alternatives to
traditional solvers. The codes for this work are available on GitHub

Abstract: We point out that neural networks are not black boxes, and their
generalization stems from the ability to dynamically map a dataset to the local
extrema of the model function. We further prove that the number of local
extrema in a neural network is positively correlated with the number of its
parameters, and on this basis, we give a new algorithm that is different from

models - such as large language models and diffusion models - not only to
generate unstructured data at scale but also to extract low-dimensional

learning to these representations, GPI enables estimation of causal and
predictive effects while quantifying associated estimation uncertainty. Unlike
existing approaches to representation learning, GPI does not require
fine-tuning of generative models, making it computationally efficient and
broadly accessible. We illustrate the versatility of the GPI framework through
three applications: (1) analyzing Chinese social media censorship, (2)
estimating predictive effects of candidates' facial appearance on electoral
outcomes, and (3) assessing the persuasiveness of political rhetoric. An
open-source software package is available for implementing GPI.

of AD progression at a subject's next clinical visit using features from a
sequence of visits extracted from the subject's visit history. We also
rigorously compare our model to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as long
short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and minimalRNN and assess
their performances based on factors such as the length of prior visits and data
imbalance. We test the importance of different feature categories and visit
history, as well as compare the model to a newer Transformer-based model
optimized for time series. Our model demonstrates strong predictive performance
despite missing visits and missing features in available visits, particularly
in identifying converter subjects -- individuals transitioning to more severe
disease stages -- an area that has posed significant challenges in longitudinal
prediction. The results highlight the model's potential in enhancing early
diagnosis and patient outcomes.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种领域中均优于现有风险敏感方法。

Conclusion: 新框架为风险敏感强化学习提供了更优的解决方案，具有理论和实际优势。

Abstract: The development of Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has introduced
a natural way to incorporate risk sensitivity into value-based and actor-critic
methods by employing risk measures other than expectation in the value
function. While this approach is widely adopted in many online and offline RL
algorithms due to its simplicity, the naive integration of risk measures often
results in suboptimal policies. This limitation can be particularly harmful in
scenarios where the need for effective risk-sensitive policies is critical and
worst-case outcomes carry severe consequences. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel framework for optimizing static Spectral Risk Measures (SRM), a
flexible family of risk measures that generalizes objectives such as CVaR and
Mean-CVaR, and enables the tailoring of risk preferences. Our method is
applicable to both online and offline RL algorithms. We establish theoretical
guarantees by proving convergence in the finite state-action setting. Moreover,
through extensive empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that our algorithms
consistently outperform existing risk-sensitive methods in both online and
offline environments across diverse domains.

Motivation: 现有方法将代理模型与生成模型紧密耦合，导致潜在空间未针对特定任务优化时性能不佳，因此探索解耦方法以发挥各自优势。

Method: 分别训练VAE和GP代理模型，通过贝叶斯更新规则结合，使VAE专注于结构生成，GP专注于预测建模。

Result: 在有限评估预算下，解耦方法能更有效地识别高潜力分子候选。

Conclusion: 解耦方法通过分离生成与预测任务，提升了分子优化问题的性能。

Abstract: Bayesian optimisation in the latent space of a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE)
is a powerful framework for optimisation tasks over complex structured domains,
such as the space of scientifically interesting molecules. However, existing
approaches tightly couple the surrogate and generative models, which can lead
to suboptimal performance when the latent space is not tailored to specific
tasks, which in turn has led to the proposal of increasingly sophisticated
algorithms. In this work, we explore a new direction, instead proposing a
decoupled approach that trains a generative model and a Gaussian Process (GP)
surrogate separately, then combines them via a simple yet principled Bayesian
update rule. This separation allows each component to focus on its strengths --
structure generation from the VAE and predictive modelling by the GP. We show
that our decoupled approach improves our ability to identify high-potential
candidates in molecular optimisation problems under constrained evaluation
budgets.

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在基准数据集上表现优越。

Conclusion: CAPIMAC有效提升了多模态数据融合质量，代码将公开。

Abstract: Multimodal representation is faithful and highly effective in describing
real-world data samples' characteristics by describing their complementary
information. However, the collected data often exhibits incomplete and
misaligned characteristics due to factors such as inconsistent sensor
frequencies and device malfunctions. Existing research has not effectively
addressed the issue of filling missing data in scenarios where multiview data
are both imbalanced and misaligned. Instead, it relies on class-level alignment
of the available data. Thus, it results in some data samples not being
well-matched, thereby affecting the quality of data fusion. In this paper, we
propose the Consistency-Aware Padding for Incomplete Multimodal Alignment
Clustering Based on Self-Repellent Greedy Anchor Search(CAPIMAC) to tackle the
problem of filling imbalanced and misaligned data in multimodal datasets.
Specifically, we propose a self-repellent greedy anchor search module(SRGASM),
which employs a self-repellent random walk combined with a greedy algorithm to
identify anchor points for re-representing incomplete and misaligned multimodal
data. Subsequently, based on noise-contrastive learning, we design a
consistency-aware padding module (CAPM) to effectively interpolate and align
imbalanced and misaligned data, thereby improving the quality of multimodal
data fusion. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method
over benchmark datasets. The code will be publicly released at
https://github.com/Autism-mm/CAPIMAC.git.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将化学化合物转换为手工特征向量，但由于MILP的限制，学习性能不足，影响了推断化学图的质量。GNN能直接利用化学图作为输入，表现出更好的学习性能。

Method: 结合GNN和MILP，开发了mol-infer-GNN框架，保留了两层模型的灵活性。

Result: 在QM9数据集上实验表明，GNN模型对某些性质具有较好的学习性能，并能推断出包含最多20个非氢原子的小化学图。

Conclusion: mol-infer-GNN框架在提高学习性能和推断效率方面表现出潜力。

Abstract: Recently, a novel two-phase framework named mol-infer for inference of
chemical compounds with prescribed abstract structures and desired property
values has been proposed. The framework mol-infer is primarily based on using
mixed integer linear programming (MILP) to simulate the computational process
of machine learning methods and describe the necessary and sufficient
conditions to ensure such a chemical graph exists. The existing approaches
usually first convert the chemical compounds into handcrafted feature vectors
to construct prediction functions, but because of the limit on the kinds of
descriptors originated from the need for tractability in the MILP formulation,
the learning performances on datasets of some properties are not good enough. A
lack of good learning performance can greatly lower the quality of the inferred
chemical graphs, and thus improving learning performance is of great
importance. On the other hand, graph neural networks (GNN) offer a promising
machine learning method to directly utilize the chemical graphs as the input,
and many existing GNN-based approaches to the molecular property prediction
problem have shown that they can enjoy better learning performances compared to
the traditional approaches that are based on feature vectors. In this study, we
develop a molecular inference framework based on mol-infer, namely
mol-infer-GNN, that utilizes GNN as the learning method while keeping the great
flexibility originated from the two-layered model on the abstract structure of
the chemical graph to be inferred. We conducted computational experiments on
the QM9 dataset to show that our proposed GNN model can obtain satisfying
learning performances for some properties despite its simple structure, and can
infer small chemical graphs comprising up to 20 non-hydrogen atoms within
reasonable computational time.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多通道时空Mamba模型（MCST-Mamba），用于同时预测多个交通特征，解决了现有方法只能预测单一变量或需要多个模型的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通预测在智能交通系统中至关重要，但现有方法难以同时处理多变量输入和动态交通条件。

Method: 基于Mamba选择性状态空间架构，MCST-Mamba模型通过自适应时空嵌入和分离时空建模来提升表示学习。

Result: MCST-Mamba在所有交通特征上表现出色，且参数更少。

Conclusion: MCST-Mamba为多变量交通预测提供了高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate traffic prediction plays a vital role in intelligent transportation
systems by enabling efficient routing, congestion mitigation, and proactive
traffic control. However, forecasting is challenging due to the combined
effects of dynamic road conditions, varying traffic patterns across different
locations, and external influences such as weather and accidents. Traffic data
often consists of several interrelated measurements - such as speed, flow and
occupancy - yet many deep-learning approaches either predict only one of these
variables or require a separate model for each. This limits their ability to
capture joint patterns across channels. To address this, we introduce the
Multi-Channel Spatio-Temporal (MCST) Mamba model, a forecasting framework built
on the Mamba selective state-space architecture that natively handles
multivariate inputs and simultaneously models all traffic features. The
proposed MCST-Mamba model integrates adaptive spatio-temporal embeddings and
separates the modeling of temporal sequences and spatial sensor interactions
into two dedicated Mamba blocks, improving representation learning. Unlike
prior methods that evaluate on a single channel, we assess MCST-Mamba across
all traffic features at once, aligning more closely with how congestion arises
in practice. Our results show that MCST-Mamba achieves strong predictive
performance with a lower parameter count compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: 基于注意力的架构在知识图谱补全任务中能有效捕捉复杂关系模式。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs offer a structured representation of real-world entities and
their relationships, enabling a wide range of applications from information
retrieval to automated reasoning. In this paper, we conduct a systematic
comparison between traditional rule-based approaches and modern deep learning
methods for link prediction. We focus on KBGAT, a graph neural network model
that leverages multi-head attention to jointly encode both entity and relation
features within local neighborhood structures. To advance this line of
research, we introduce \textbf{GCAT} (Graph Collaborative Attention Network), a
refined model that enhances context aggregation and interaction between
heterogeneous nodes. Experimental results on four widely-used benchmark
datasets demonstrate that GCAT not only consistently outperforms rule-based
methods but also achieves competitive or superior performance compared to
existing neural embedding models. Our findings highlight the advantages of
attention-based architectures in capturing complex relational patterns for
knowledge graph completion tasks.

Conclusion: 管道快速适应新环境，训练和部署流程在一小时内完成。

Abstract: A lightweight, edge-deployable pipeline is proposed for detecting sensor
anomalies in chemistry and biology laboratories. A custom PCB captures seven
sensor channels and streams them over the local network. An Attention-based
One-Class Autoencoder reaches a usable state after training on only thirty
minutes of normal data. Despite the small data set, the model already attains
an F1 score of 0.72, a precision of 0.89, and a recall of 0.61 when tested on
synthetic micro-anomalies. The trained network is converted into a
TensorFlow-Lite binary of about 31 kB and runs on an Advantech ARK-1221L, a
fan-less x86 edge device without AVX instructions; end-to-end inference latency
stays below two seconds. The entire collect-train-deploy workflow finishes
within one hour, which demonstrates that the pipeline adapts quickly whenever a

Result: 实验显示，改进后的Tree-Enhanced CodeBERTa在损失、准确率、F1分数、精确率和召回率上均优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 显式编码源代码的结构信息对提升Transformer模型的性能至关重要。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have demonstrated significant success in various
source code representation tasks. Nonetheless, traditional positional
embeddings employed by these models inadequately capture the hierarchical
structure intrinsic to source code, typically represented as Abstract Syntax
Trees (ASTs). To address this, we propose a novel tree-based positional
embedding approach that explicitly encodes hierarchical relationships derived
from ASTs, including node depth and sibling indices. These hierarchical
embeddings are integrated into the transformer architecture, specifically
enhancing the CodeBERTa model. We thoroughly evaluate our proposed model
through masked language modeling (MLM) pretraining and clone detection
fine-tuning tasks. Experimental results indicate that our Tree-Enhanced
CodeBERTa consistently surpasses the baseline model in terms of loss, accuracy,
F1 score, precision, and recall, emphasizing the importance of incorporating
explicit structural information into transformer-based representations of
source code.

Conclusion: 研究为城市建模提供了网络效应整合方法，对政策制定有重要意义。

Abstract: Urban socioeconomic modeling has predominantly concentrated on extensive
location and neighborhood-based features, relying on the localized population
footprint. However, networks in urban systems are common, and many urban
modeling methods don't account for network-based effects. In this study, we
propose using commute information records from the census as a reliable and
comprehensive source to construct mobility networks across cities. Leveraging
deep learning architectures, we employ these commute networks across U.S. metro
areas for socioeconomic modeling. We show that mobility network structures
provide significant predictive performance without considering any node
features. Consequently, we use mobility networks to present a supervised
learning framework to model a city's socioeconomic indicator directly,
combining Graph Neural Network and Vanilla Neural Network models to learn all
parameters in a single learning pipeline. Our experiments in 12 major U.S.
cities show the proposed model outperforms previous conventional machine
learning models. This work provides urban researchers methods to incorporate
network effects in urban modeling and informs stakeholders of wider
network-based effects in urban policymaking and planning.

Result: 实验证明这两种方法在数据评估和参数调优中有效，可用于识别错误标签数据、模型编辑和提高可解释性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为SAM中的数据影响评估提供了高效且准确的解决方案，适用于多种实际应用场景。

Abstract: Sharpness-aware Minimization (SAM) improves generalization in large-scale
model training by linking loss landscape geometry to generalization. However,
challenges such as mislabeled noisy data and privacy concerns have emerged as
significant issues. Data attribution, which identifies the contributions of
specific training samples, offers a promising solution. However, directly
rendering existing data influence evaluation tools such as influence functions
(IF) to SAM will be inapplicable or inaccurate as SAM utilizes an inner loop to
find model perturbations that maximize loss, which the outer loop then
minimizes, resulting in a doubled computational structure. Additionally, this
bilevel structure complicates the modeling of data influence on the parameters.
In this paper, based on the IF, we develop two innovative data valuation
methods for SAM, each offering unique benefits in different scenarios: the
Hessian-based IF and the Gradient Trajectory-based IF. The first one provides a
comprehensive estimation of data influence using a closed-form measure that
relies only on the trained model weights. In contrast, the other IF for SAM
utilizes gradient trajectory information during training for more accurate and
efficient data assessment. Extensive experiments demonstrate their
effectiveness in data evaluation and parameter tuning, with applications in
identifying mislabeled data, model editing, and enhancing interpretability.

Motivation: Dreamer算法的潜在空间压缩可能导致关键信息丢失，影响智能体性能。现有方法（如Δ-IRIS和DIAMOND）需直接从像素训练，效率低下且无法利用世界模型学习的内在表示。

Method: EMERALD采用空间潜在状态和MaskGIT预测，生成潜在空间中的准确轨迹。

Result: 在Crafter基准测试中，EMERALD实现了新的最先进性能，首次在10M环境步骤内超越人类专家表现，并解锁全部22项成就。

Conclusion: EMERALD为世界建模提供了一种高效且准确的替代方案，显著提升了智能体性能。

Abstract: The Dreamer algorithm has recently obtained remarkable performance across
diverse environment domains by training powerful agents with simulated
trajectories. However, the compressed nature of its world model's latent space
can result in the loss of crucial information, negatively affecting the agent's
performance. Recent approaches, such as $\Delta$-IRIS and DIAMOND, address this
limitation by training more accurate world models. However, these methods
require training agents directly from pixels, which reduces training efficiency
and prevents the agent from benefiting from the inner representations learned
by the world model. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to world
modeling that is both accurate and efficient. We introduce EMERALD (Efficient
MaskEd latent tRAnsformer worLD model), a world model using a spatial latent
state with MaskGIT predictions to generate accurate trajectories in latent
space and improve the agent performance. On the Crafter benchmark, EMERALD
achieves new state-of-the-art performance, becoming the first method to surpass
human experts performance within 10M environment steps. Our method also
succeeds to unlock all 22 Crafter achievements at least once during evaluation.

Abstract: Inductive learning aims to construct general models from specific examples,
guided by biases that influence hypothesis selection and determine
generalization capacity. In this work, we focus on characterizing the
relational inductive biases present in attention mechanisms, understood as
assumptions about the underlying relationships between data elements. From the
perspective of geometric deep learning, we analyze the most common attention
mechanisms in terms of their equivariance properties with respect to
permutation subgroups, which allows us to propose a classification based on
their relational biases. Under this perspective, we show that different
attention layers are characterized by the underlying relationships they assume
on the input data.

Motivation: 现有DFKD方法通常假设教师模型可信，但忽略了来自不可信教师的鲁棒性和安全性问题。本文首次研究了如何从NTL教师中蒸馏知识。

Method: 提出ATEsc方法，通过分析合成样本的对抗鲁棒性，将其分为ID-like和OOD-like两组，分别用于知识蒸馏和遗忘OOD知识。

Result: 实验证明ATEsc能有效提升DFKD在NTL教师下的性能。

Conclusion: ATEsc为DFKD提供了一种对抗NTL教师的新方法，显著改善了知识蒸馏的效果。

Abstract: Data-free knowledge distillation (DFKD) transfers knowledge from a teacher to
a student without access the real in-distribution (ID) data. Its common
solution is to use a generator to synthesize fake data and use them as a
substitute for real ID data. However, existing works typically assume teachers
are trustworthy, leaving the robustness and security of DFKD from untrusted
teachers largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct the first investigation
into distilling non-transferable learning (NTL) teachers using DFKD, where the
transferability from an ID domain to an out-of-distribution (OOD) domain is
prohibited. We find that NTL teachers fool DFKD through divert the generator's
attention from the useful ID knowledge to the misleading OOD knowledge. This
hinders ID knowledge transfer but prioritizes OOD knowledge transfer. To
mitigate this issue, we propose Adversarial Trap Escaping (ATEsc) to benefit
DFKD by identifying and filtering out OOD-like synthetic samples. Specifically,
inspired by the evidence that NTL teachers show stronger adversarial robustness
on OOD samples than ID samples, we split synthetic samples into two groups
according to their robustness. The fragile group is treated as ID-like data and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究GNNs和Transformers在编码策略上的相似性与差异，特别是在相对位置信息不重要的领域（如单细胞转录组学），探索GNNs是否可以作为更高效的替代方案。

Method: 通过理论分析GNNs和Transformers的编码策略差异，设计合成实验验证其在无相对位置信息时的等效性，并在单细胞转录组学数据集上进行实验对比。

Result: 实验表明，在单细胞转录组学中，GNNs性能与Transformers相当，但计算资源消耗更少。

Conclusion: 在无需相对位置信息的场景下，GNNs可以替代Transformers，为单细胞转录组学等领域提供了新的选择，挑战了Transformers作为最优选择的普遍观念。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers share significant similarities
in their encoding strategies for interacting with features from nodes of
interest, where Transformers use query-key scores and GNNs use edges. Compared
to GNNs, which are unable to encode relative positions, Transformers leverage
dynamic attention capabilities to better represent relative relationships,
thereby becoming the standard backbones in large-scale sequential pre-training.
However, the subtle difference prompts us to consider: if positions are no
longer crucial, could we substitute Transformers with Graph Neural Networks in
some fields such as Single-Cell Transcriptomics? In this paper, we first
explore the similarities and differences between GNNs and Transformers,
specifically in terms of relative positions. Additionally, we design a
synthetic example to illustrate their equivalence where there are no relative
positions between tokens in the sample. Finally, we conduct extensive
experiments on a large-scale position-agnostic dataset-single-cell
transcriptomics-finding that GNNs achieve competitive performance compared to
Transformers while consuming fewer computation resources. These findings
provide novel insights for researchers in the field of single-cell
transcriptomics, challenging the prevailing notion that the Transformer is
always the optimum choice.

Abstract: We propose a non-autoregressive framework for the Travelling Salesman Problem

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过概率评分和不确定性量化技术，进一步提升Tsetlin机器的透明度和预测解释能力。

Method: 分析了TM的学习动态，推导出概率评分，并通过模拟数据和CIFAR-10数据集验证其有效性。

Result: 概率评分与数据基础概率相关，且在训练数据域外TM预测信心下降，与神经网络的外推现象形成对比。

Conclusion: 不确定性量化技术为TM图像分类模型提供了新见解和改进方向。

Abstract: Data modeling using Tsetlin machines (TMs) is all about building logical
rules from the data features. The decisions of the model are based on a
combination of these logical rules. Hence, the model is fully transparent and
it is possible to get explanations of its predictions. In this paper, we
present a probability score for TM predictions and develop new techniques for
uncertainty quantification to increase the explainability further. The
probability score is an inherent property of any TM variant and is derived
through an analysis of the TM learning dynamics. Simulated data is used to show
a clear connection between the learned TM probability scores and the underlying
probabilities of the data. A visualization of the probability scores also
reveals that the TM is less confident in its predictions outside the training
data domain, which contrasts the typical extrapolation phenomenon found in
Artificial Neural Networks. The paper concludes with an application of the
uncertainty quantification techniques on an image classification task using the
CIFAR-10 dataset, where they provide new insights and suggest possible
improvements to current TM image classification models.

general-purpose differentiable meshfree solver within a hybrid
Lagrangian-Eulerian framework, tailored for simulating complex continuum
mechanics involving large deformations, frictional contact, and inelastic
material behavior, with emphasis on geomechanics and geophysical hazard
applications. Built on the material point method (MPM) and implemented using
the JAX computing framework, JAX-MPM is fully differentiable and
GPU-accelerated, enabling efficient gradient-based optimization directly
through time-stepping solvers. It supports joint training of physical models
and neural networks, allowing the learning of embedded closures and neural
constitutive models. We validate JAX-MPM on several 2D and 3D benchmarks,
including dam-breaks and granular collapses, demonstrating its accuracy and
performance. A high-resolution 3D granular cylinder collapse with 2.7 million
particles completes 1000 steps in ~22 seconds (single precision) and ~98
seconds (double precision) on a single GPU. Beyond forward modeling, we
demonstrate inverse modeling capabilities such as velocity field reconstruction
and spatially varying friction estimation. These results establish JAX-MPM as a

Result: Extra Trees算法表现最佳，预测准确率77%，发现气象条件是主要驱动因素，污染水平季节性变化显著。

Conclusion: 智能预测系统可为城市规划者提供工具，改善空气质量管理，技术已具备应用条件。

Abstract: Air pollution poses a critical health threat in cities worldwide, with
nitrogen dioxide levels in Cork, Ireland exceeding World Health Organization
safety standards by up to $278\%$. This study leverages artificial intelligence
to predict air pollution with unprecedented accuracy, analyzing nearly ten
years of data from five monitoring stations combined with 30 years of weather
records. We evaluated 17 machine learning algorithms, with Extra Trees emerging
as the optimal solution, achieving $77\%$ prediction accuracy and significantly
outperforming traditional forecasting methods. Our analysis reveals that
meteorological conditions particularly temperature, wind speed, and humidity
are the primary drivers of pollution levels, while traffic patterns and
seasonal changes create predictable pollution cycles. Pollution exhibits
dramatic seasonal variations, with winter levels nearly double those of summer,
and daily rush-hour peaks reaching $120\%$ above normal levels. While Cork's
air quality shows concerning violations of global health standards, our models
detected an encouraging $31\%$ improvement from 2014 to 2022. This research
demonstrates that intelligent forecasting systems can provide city planners and
environmental officials with powerful prediction tools, enabling life-saving
early warning systems and informed urban planning decisions. The technology
exists today to transform urban air quality management. All research materials

Result: 明确了正向过程噪声对学习预测器的贡献，提供了新的理论见解。

Conclusion: 论文为扩散模型的结构提供了更清晰的理论基础。

Abstract: In denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), the learned noise
predictor $ \epsilon_{\theta} ( {\bf x}_t , t)$ is trained to approximate the
forward-process noise $\epsilon_t$. The equality $\nabla_{{\bf x}_t} \log
q({\bf x}_t) = -\frac 1 {\sqrt {1- {\bar \alpha}_t} } \epsilon_{\theta} ( {\bf
x}_t , t)$ plays a fundamental role in both theoretical analyses and
algorithmic design, and thus is frequently employed across diffusion-based
generative models. In this paper, an explicit formulation of $
\epsilon_{\theta} ( {\bf x}_t , t)$ in terms of the forward-process noise
$\epsilon_t$ is derived. This result show how the forward-process noise
$\epsilon_t$ contributes to the learned predictor $ \epsilon_{\theta} ( {\bf
x}_t , t)$. Furthermore, based on this formulation, we present a novel and
mathematically rigorous proof of the fundamental equality above, clarifying its
origin and providing new theoretical insight into the structure of diffusion
models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的遗忘方法Partial Model Collapse (PMC)，避免直接优化敏感数据，而是通过部分模型崩溃实现遗忘，更有效地移除私有信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遗忘方法直接优化敏感数据，可能强化其暴露，且违背最小化使用原则。PMC旨在解决这一问题。

Method: PMC利用生成模型在自身生成数据上训练导致分布崩溃的现象，部分触发崩溃以移除敏感信息，无需在目标中包含遗忘数据。

Result: 理论分析表明PMC能收敛至遗忘目标，实证显示其克服了现有方法的局限性，更有效移除私有信息。

Conclusion: PMC为更全面的遗忘方法提供了重要进展，符合实际隐私约束。

Abstract: Current unlearning methods for LLMs optimize on the private information they
seek to remove by incorporating it into their training objectives. We argue
this not only risks reinforcing exposure to sensitive data, it also
fundamentally contradicts the principle of minimizing its use. As a remedy, we
propose a novel unlearning method - Partial Model Collapse (PMC), which does
not require unlearning targets in the unlearning objective. Our approach is
inspired by recent observations that training generative models on their own
generations leads to distribution collapse, effectively removing information
from the model. Our core idea is to leverage this collapse for unlearning by
triggering collapse partially on the sensitive data. We theoretically analyze
that our approach converges to the desired outcome, i.e. the LLM unlearns the
information in the forget set. We empirically demonstrate that PMC overcomes
two key limitations of existing unlearning approaches that explicitly optimize
on unlearning targets, and more effectively removes private information from
model outputs. Overall, our contributions represent an important step toward
more comprehensive unlearning that aligns with real-world privacy constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 环肽因其几何约束具有优于线性肽的生化特性，但目标特异性环肽设计因数据不足而受限。

Method: CP-Composer将复杂环化模式分解为单元约束，通过扩散模型结合几何条件生成环肽。

Result: 模型在未训练环肽的情况下，生成多样化的目标结合环肽，成功率从38%到84%。

Conclusion: CP-Composer为环肽设计提供了高效工具，填补了数据不足的空白。

Abstract: Cyclic peptides, characterized by geometric constraints absent in linear
peptides, offer enhanced biochemical properties, presenting new opportunities
to address unmet medical needs. However, designing target-specific cyclic
peptides remains underexplored due to limited training data. To bridge the gap,
we propose CP-Composer, a novel generative framework that enables zero-shot
cyclic peptide generation via composable geometric constraints. Our approach
decomposes complex cyclization patterns into unit constraints, which are
incorporated into a diffusion model through geometric conditioning on nodes and
edges. During training, the model learns from unit constraints and their random
combinations in linear peptides, while at inference, novel constraint
combinations required for cyclization are imposed as input. Experiments show
that our model, despite trained with linear peptides, is capable of generating
diverse target-binding cyclic peptides, reaching success rates from 38% to 84%
on different cyclization strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低秩恢复在压缩感知理论中有广泛应用，但现有方法主要针对矩阵，而高维张量的低秩恢复需求日益增长，因此需要扩展NIHT方法以支持张量数据。

Method: 提出TNIHT方法，扩展NIHT至张量领域，支持CP和Tucker两种低秩分解模型，并在TRIP条件下建立收敛理论。

Result: 理论证明了TNIHT的收敛性，实验验证其在合成数据、图像和视频上的性能优于现有算法。

Conclusion: TNIHT是一种高效的低秩张量恢复方法，适用于多种数据场景，具有理论和实验支持。

Abstract: Low-rank recovery builds upon ideas from the theory of compressive sensing,
which predicts that sparse signals can be accurately reconstructed from
incomplete measurements. Iterative thresholding-type algorithms-particularly
the normalized iterative hard thresholding (NIHT) method-have been widely used
in compressed sensing (CS) and applied to matrix recovery tasks. In this paper,
we propose a tensor extension of NIHT, referred to as TNIHT, for the recovery
of low-rank tensors under two widely used tensor decomposition models. This
extension enables the effective reconstruction of high-order low-rank tensors
from a limited number of linear measurements by leveraging the inherent
low-dimensional structure of multi-way data. Specifically, we consider both the
CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) rank and the Tucker rank to characterize tensor
low-rankness within the TNIHT framework. At the same time, we establish a
convergence theorem for the proposed TNIHT method under the tensor restricted
isometry property (TRIP), providing theoretical support for its recovery
guarantees. Finally, we evaluate the performance of TNIHT through numerical
experiments on synthetic, image, and video data, and compare it with several
state-of-the-art algorithms.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“power attention”的线性成本序列建模层，解决了传统Transformer和次二次方架构在长序列训练中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer处理长序列成本过高，而次二次方架构成本过低，滑动窗口注意力等方法又损害了上下文学习能力。

Method: 引入power attention层，其状态大小可独立于参数调整，并开发了高效的GPU内核。

Result: 实验表明，power attention在长上下文训练中优于指数注意力和线性注意力。

Conclusion: power attention是一种有效的长序列建模解决方案。

Abstract: We argue that neither transformers nor sub-quadratic architectures are well
suited to training at long sequence lengths: the cost of processing the context
is too expensive in the former, too inexpensive in the latter. Approaches such
as sliding window attention which reduce the cost-per-token of a transformer
impair in-context learning, and so are also unsuitable. To address these
limitations, we introduce power attention, an architectural layer for
linear-cost sequence modeling whose state size can be adjusted independently of
parameters, unlocking the advantages of linear attention on practical domains.
We develop and open-source a set of GPU kernels for efficient power attention,
identifying a novel pattern of operation fusion to avoid memory and bandwidth
bottlenecks. Our experiments on the in-context learning of power attention
shows that these models dominate both exponential attention and linear
attention at long-context training.

Result: 在多个基准测试中有效减少过度拒绝，同时保持对有害查询的处理能力和模型整体实用性。

Conclusion: ACTOR是一种高效且鲁棒的训练框架，能够显著减少过度拒绝问题，提升模型实用性。

Abstract: Safety alignment is crucial for large language models (LLMs) to resist
malicious instructions but often results in over-refusals, where benign prompts
are unnecessarily rejected, impairing user experience and model utility. We
introduce ACTOR (Activation-Based Training for Over-Refusal Reduction), a
robust and compute- and data-efficient training framework that minimizes
over-refusals by leveraging internal activation patterns from diverse queries.
ACTOR precisely identifies and adjusts the activation components that trigger
refusals, providing stronger control over the refusal mechanism. By fine-tuning
only a single model layer, ACTOR effectively reduces over-refusals across
multiple benchmarks while maintaining the model's ability to handle harmful
queries and preserve overall utility.

Conclusion: Retformer为AD早期诊断提供了高效且可解释的解决方案，视网膜图像特征与AD诊断相关。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects
millions worldwide. In the absence of effective treatment options, early
diagnosis is crucial for initiating management strategies to delay disease
onset and slow down its progression. In this study, we propose Retformer, a
novel transformer-based architecture for detecting AD using retinal imaging
modalities, leveraging the power of transformers and explainable artificial
intelligence. The Retformer model is trained on datasets of different
modalities of retinal images from patients with AD and age-matched healthy
controls, enabling it to learn complex patterns and relationships between image
features and disease diagnosis. To provide insights into the decision-making
process of our model, we employ the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping
algorithm to visualize the feature importance maps, highlighting the regions of
the retinal images that contribute most significantly to the classification
outcome. These findings are compared to existing clinical studies on detecting
AD using retinal biomarkers, allowing us to identify the most important
features for AD detection in each imaging modality. The Retformer model
outperforms a variety of benchmark algorithms across different performance
metrics by margins of up to 11\.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习中数据分布和模型架构的异质性挑战，特别是原型分离不足的问题。

Method: 采用原型对齐（PA）优化全局原型配置，原型放大（PU）增强欧几里得空间中的分离。

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优于现有HtFL方法，原型分离效果显著。

Conclusion: ProtoNorm继承了PBFL的通信效率，适合资源受限环境，是一种高效的联邦学习解决方案。

Abstract: Heterogeneity in data distributions and model architectures remains a
significant challenge in federated learning (FL). Various heterogeneous FL
(HtFL) approaches have recently been proposed to address this challenge. Among
them, prototype-based FL (PBFL) has emerged as a practical framework that only
shares per-class mean activations from the penultimate layer. However, PBFL
approaches often suffer from suboptimal prototype separation, limiting their
discriminative power. We propose Prototype Normalization (ProtoNorm), a novel
PBFL framework that addresses this limitation through two key components:
Prototype Alignment (PA) and Prototype Upscaling (PU). The PA method draws
inspiration from the Thomson problem in classical physics, optimizing global
prototype configurations on a unit sphere to maximize angular separation;
subsequently, the PU method increases prototype magnitudes to enhance
separation in Euclidean space. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show
that our approach better separates prototypes and thus consistently outperforms
existing HtFL approaches. Notably, since ProtoNorm inherits the communication
efficiency of PBFL and the PA is performed server-side, it is particularly

TL;DR: TinyProto通过类原型稀疏化和自适应缩放，显著降低联邦学习中的通信开销，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中的通信效率在资源受限环境中是关键挑战，现有原型方法在大特征维度和多类情况下效率下降。

Method: 提出TinyProto，采用类原型稀疏化（CPS）和自适应原型缩放，仅传输非零元素并根据类别分布调整原型。

Result: 实验显示TinyProto通信成本降低4倍，性能不变，且无需客户端额外计算开销。

Conclusion: TinyProto是资源受限异构联邦学习的理想解决方案，兼具高效通信和架构兼容性。

Abstract: Communication efficiency in federated learning (FL) remains a critical
challenge for resource-constrained environments. While prototype-based FL
reduces communication overhead by sharing class prototypes-mean activations in
the penultimate layer-instead of model parameters, its efficiency decreases
with larger feature dimensions and class counts. We propose TinyProto, which
addresses these limitations through Class-wise Prototype Sparsification (CPS)
and adaptive prototype scaling. CPS enables structured sparsity by allocating
specific dimensions to class prototypes and transmitting only non-zero
elements, while adaptive scaling adjusts prototypes based on class
distributions. Our experiments show TinyProto reduces communication costs by up
to 4x compared to existing methods while maintaining performance. Beyond its
communication efficiency, TinyProto offers crucial advantages: achieving
compression without client-side computational overhead and supporting
heterogeneous architectures, making it ideal for resource-constrained
heterogeneous FL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多CATE估计算法在不同组分配下对同一实例表现出不一致的学习行为，这种不一致性导致更高的测试误差。

Method: 提出了一种通用方法CLAGA，通过消除不一致性来改进现有CATE估计算法。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，CLAGA显著提高了性能。

Conclusion: CLAGA是一种有效的方法，能够解决CATE估计中的不一致性问题，并提升算法性能。

Abstract: Numerous algorithms have been developed for Conditional Average Treatment
Effect (CATE) estimation. In this paper, we first highlight a common issue
where many algorithms exhibit inconsistent learning behavior for the same
instance across different group assignments. We introduce a metric to quantify
and visualize this inconsistency. Next, we present a theoretical analysis
showing that this inconsistency indeed contributes to higher test errors and
cannot be resolved through conventional machine learning techniques. To address
this problem, we propose a general method called \textbf{Consistent Labeling
Across Group Assignments} (CLAGA), which eliminates the inconsistency and is
applicable to any existing CATE estimation algorithm. Experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate significant performance
improvements with CLAGA.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集（如TCGA-BRCA基因表达数据）上验证，方法能准确恢复理论预期结果。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于交互分析的特征选择或模型开发提供了潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Understanding the contribution of individual features in predictive models
remains a central goal in interpretable machine learning, and while many
model-agnostic methods exist to estimate feature importance, they often fall
short in capturing high-order interactions and disentangling overlapping
contributions. In this work, we present an information-theoretic extension of
the High-order interactions for Feature importance (Hi-Fi) method, leveraging
Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) estimated via a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN)
approach working on mixed discrete and continuous random variables. Our
framework decomposes feature contributions into unique, synergistic, and
redundant components, offering a richer, model-independent understanding of
their predictive roles. We validate the method using synthetic datasets with
known Gaussian structures, where ground truth interaction patterns are
analytically derived, and further test it on non-Gaussian and real-world gene
expression data from TCGA-BRCA. Results indicate that the proposed estimator
accurately recovers theoretical and expected findings, providing a potential
use case for developing feature selection algorithms or model development based
on interaction analysis.

Motivation: 现有遥感基础模型的自监督学习任务忽视了农业景观的独特时间特性（如自然周期），因此提出针对性的新任务。

Method: 提出三种农业特定任务：时间差预测（TD）、时间频率预测（FP）和未来帧预测（FF），并在SICKLE和FTW India数据集上评估。

Result: FF在农作物分类上达到69.6% IoU，FP将产量预测误差降至30.7% MAPE，TD在多数任务中表现优异。FF在印度全国范围内也优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 农业特定的自监督学习任务显著提升了遥感基础模型在农业场景中的性能。

Abstract: Self Supervised Learning(SSL) has emerged as a prominent paradigm for
label-efficient learning, and has been widely utilized by remote sensing
foundation models(RSFMs). Recent RSFMs including SatMAE, DoFA, primarily rely
on masked autoencoding(MAE), contrastive learning or some combination of them.
However, these pretext tasks often overlook the unique temporal characteristics
of agricultural landscape, namely nature's cycle. Motivated by this gap, we
propose three novel agriculture-specific pretext tasks, namely Time-Difference
Prediction(TD), Temporal Frequency Prediction(FP), and Future-Frame
Prediction(FF). Comprehensive evaluation on SICKLE dataset shows FF achieves
69.6% IoU on crop mapping and FP reduces yield prediction error to 30.7% MAPE,
outperforming all baselines, and TD remains competitive on most tasks. Further,
we also scale FF to the national scale of India, achieving 54.2% IoU
outperforming all baselines on field boundary delineation on FTW India dataset.

Motivation: 传统恶意软件检测方法因特征提取效率低，难以在实时部署中平衡准确性与效率。

Method: 将恶意软件分类建模为马尔可夫决策过程，采用D3QN框架进行动态特征选择。

Result: 在Microsoft Big2015和BODMAS数据集上，D3QN分别达到99.22%和98.83%的准确率，同时显著减少特征数量（96.6%和97.6%的降维）。

Conclusion: 强化学习驱动的自适应特征选择方法在恶意软件分类中表现出色，实现了高精度与高效计算的结合。

Abstract: Traditional malware detection methods exhibit computational inefficiency due
to exhaustive feature extraction requirements, creating accuracy-efficiency
trade-offs that limit real-time deployment. We formulate malware classification
as a Markov Decision Process with episodic feature acquisition and propose a
Dueling Double Deep Q-Network (D3QN) framework for adaptive sequential feature
selection. The agent learns to dynamically select informative features per
sample before terminating with classification decisions, optimizing both
detection accuracy and computational cost through reinforcement learning.
  We evaluate our approach on Microsoft Big2015 (9-class, 1,795 features) and
BODMAS (binary, 2,381 features) datasets. D3QN achieves 99.22% and 98.83%
accuracy while utilizing only 61 and 56 features on average, representing 96.6%
and 97.6% dimensionality reduction. This yields computational efficiency
improvements of 30.1x and 42.5x over traditional ensemble methods.
Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate consistent superiority over Random
Forest, XGBoost, and static feature selection approaches.
  Quantitative analysis demonstrates that D3QN learns non-random feature
selection policies with 62.5% deviation from uniform baseline distributions.
The learned policies exhibit structured hierarchical preferences, utilizing
high-level metadata features for initial assessment while selectively
incorporating detailed behavioral features based on classification uncertainty.
Feature specialization analysis reveals 57.7% of examined features demonstrate
significant class-specific discrimination patterns. Our results validate
reinforcement learning-based sequential feature selection for malware
classification, achieving superior accuracy with substantial computational
reduction through learned adaptive policies.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在树结构和特定随机图结构中表现优异，训练成本显著降低。

Conclusion: 论文为因果HRL提供了理论分析，实验验证了其优于现有方法。

Abstract: Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) improves the efficiency of
long-horizon reinforcement-learning tasks with sparse rewards by decomposing
the task into a hierarchy of subgoals. The main challenge of HRL is efficient
discovery of the hierarchical structure among subgoals and utilizing this
structure to achieve the final goal. We address this challenge by modeling the
subgoal structure as a causal graph and propose a causal discovery algorithm to
learn it. Additionally, rather than intervening on the subgoals at random
during exploration, we harness the discovered causal model to prioritize
subgoal interventions based on their importance in attaining the final goal.
These targeted interventions result in a significantly more efficient policy in
terms of the training cost. Unlike previous work on causal HRL, which lacked
theoretical analysis, we provide a formal analysis of the problem.
Specifically, for tree structures and, for a variant of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi
random graphs, our approach results in remarkable improvements. Our
experimental results on HRL tasks also illustrate that our proposed framework
outperforms existing work in terms of training cost.

Motivation: 解决概率电路在表示学习中未充分探索的问题，弥补依赖外部神经嵌入或激活编码的不足。

Method: APCs通过联合建模数据和嵌入，利用概率推理获取嵌入表示，并与神经解码器结合，形成可端到端训练的混合架构。

Conclusion: APCs是一种强大且灵活的表示学习方法，展示了概率电路在鲁棒推理、分布外检测和知识蒸馏中的潜力。

Abstract: Probabilistic circuits (PCs) are powerful probabilistic models that enable
exact and tractable inference, making them highly suitable for probabilistic
reasoning and inference tasks. While dominant in neural networks,
representation learning with PCs remains underexplored, with prior approaches
relying on external neural embeddings or activation-based encodings. To address
this gap, we introduce autoencoding probabilistic circuits (APCs), a novel
framework leveraging the tractability of PCs to model probabilistic embeddings
explicitly. APCs extend PCs by jointly modeling data and embeddings, obtaining
embedding representations through tractable probabilistic inference. The PC
encoder allows the framework to natively handle arbitrary missing data and is
seamlessly integrated with a neural decoder in a hybrid, end-to-end trainable
architecture enabled by differentiable sampling. Our empirical evaluation
demonstrates that APCs outperform existing PC-based autoencoding methods in
reconstruction quality, generate embeddings competitive with, and exhibit
superior robustness in handling missing data compared to neural autoencoders.
These results highlight APCs as a powerful and flexible representation learning
method that exploits the probabilistic inference capabilities of PCs, showing
promising directions for robust inference, out-of-distribution detection, and
knowledge distillation.

Conclusion: 逆向强化学习在行为分析和效用函数重建中具有广泛应用潜力，自适应方法进一步提升了实时适应性。

Abstract: This monograph, spanning three chapters, explores Inverse Reinforcement
Learning (IRL). The first two chapters view inverse reinforcement learning
(IRL) through the lens of revealed preferences from microeconomics while the
third chapter studies adaptive IRL via Langevin dynamics stochastic gradient
algorithms.
  Chapter uses classical revealed preference theory (Afriat's theorem and
extensions) to identify constrained utility maximizers based on observed agent
actions. This allows for the reconstruction of set-valued estimates of an
agent's utility. We illustrate this procedure by identifying the presence of a
cognitive radar and reconstructing its utility function. The chapter also
addresses the construction of a statistical detector for utility maximization
behavior when agent actions are corrupted by noise.
  Chapter 2 studies Bayesian IRL. It investigates how an analyst can determine
if an observed agent is a rationally inattentive Bayesian utility maximizer
(i.e., simultaneously optimizing its utility and observation likelihood). The
chapter discusses inverse stopping-time problems, focusing on reconstructing
the continuation and stopping costs of a Bayesian agent operating over a random
horizon. We then apply this IRL methodology to identify the presence of a
Bayes-optimal sequential detector. Additionally, Chapter 2 provides a concise
overview of discrete choice models, inverse Bayesian filtering, and inverse
stochastic gradient algorithms for adaptive IRL.
  Finally, Chapter 3 introduces an adaptive IRL approach utilizing passive
Langevin dynamics. This method aims to track time-varying utility functions
given noisy and misspecified gradients. In essence, the adaptive IRL algorithms
presented in Chapter 3 can be conceptualized as inverse stochastic gradient
algorithms, as they learn the utility function in real-time while a stochastic
gradient algorithm is in operation.

Motivation: 在强化学习中，通常假设最优策略存在于给定的策略类中，但现实中这一假设可能不成立。本文旨在解决这一限制，提出一种无需假设最优策略存在的通用策略学习框架。

Method: 提出了一个通用策略学习框架，将问题转化为非欧几里得空间的一阶优化问题，并基于此提出了三种算法：Steepest Descent Policy Optimization、改进的Conservative Policy Iteration算法和Policy Mirror Descent的在线版本。

Result: 在满足变分梯度优势（VGD）条件的凸策略类下，获得了三种算法的样本复杂度上界，并通过实验验证了VGD条件的实用性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的框架和算法在无需假设最优策略存在的情况下，仍能学习到具有竞争力的策略，且VGD条件在实际环境中具有实用价值。

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) in the agnostic policy learning setting,
where the goal is to find a policy whose performance is competitive with the
best policy in a given class of interest $\Pi$ -- crucially, without assuming
that $\Pi$ contains the optimal policy. We propose a general policy learning
framework that reduces this problem to first-order optimization in a
non-Euclidean space, leading to new algorithms as well as shedding light on the
convergence properties of existing ones. Specifically, under the assumption
that $\Pi$ is convex and satisfies a variational gradient dominance (VGD)
condition -- an assumption known to be strictly weaker than more standard
completeness and coverability conditions -- we obtain sample complexity upper
bounds for three policy learning algorithms: \emph{(i)} Steepest Descent Policy
Optimization, derived from a constrained steepest descent method for non-convex
optimization; \emph{(ii)} the classical Conservative Policy Iteration algorithm
\citep{kakade2002approximately} reinterpreted through the lens of the
Frank-Wolfe method, which leads to improved convergence results; and
\emph{(iii)} an on-policy instantiation of the well-studied Policy Mirror
Descent algorithm. Finally, we empirically evaluate the VGD condition across
several standard environments, demonstrating the practical relevance of our key
assumption.

Conclusion: HMCN和HMCL有效解决了应用分层多标签分类问题，并在实际部署中取得显著效果。

Abstract: A hierarchical labeling system for mobile applications (apps) benefits a wide
range of downstream businesses that integrate the labeling with their
proprietary user data, to improve user modeling. Such a label hierarchy can
define more granular labels that capture detailed app features beyond the
limitations of traditional broad app categories. In this paper, we address the
problem of hierarchical multilabel classification for apps by using their
textual information such as names and descriptions. We present: 1) HMCN
(Hierarchical Multilabel Classification Network) for handling the
classification from two perspectives: the first focuses on a multilabel
classification without hierarchical constraints, while the second predicts
labels sequentially at each hierarchical level considering such constraints; 2)
HMCL (Hierarchical Multilabel Contrastive Learning), a scheme that is capable
of learning more distinguishable app representations to enhance the performance
of HMCN. Empirical results on our Tencent App Store dataset and two public
datasets demonstrate that our approach performs well compared with
state-of-the-art methods. The approach has been deployed at Tencent and the
multilabel classification outputs for apps have helped a downstream
task--credit risk management of user--improve its performance by 10.70% with
regard to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov metric, for over one year.

Result: 新框架将攻击成功率提升48%，效率提升两个数量级，并发现大多数优化策略对输出危害性影响有限。

Conclusion: 尾部感知的攻击和评估协议对准确评估和增强语言模型安全性至关重要。

Abstract: To guarantee safe and robust deployment of large language models (LLMs) at
scale, it is critical to accurately assess their adversarial robustness.
Existing adversarial attacks typically target harmful responses in
single-point, greedy generations, overlooking the inherently stochastic nature
of LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for adversarial robustness
evaluation that explicitly models the entire output distribution, including
tail-risks, providing better estimates for model robustness at scale. By
casting the attack process as a resource allocation problem between
optimization and sampling, we determine compute-optimal tradeoffs and show that
integrating sampling into existing attacks boosts ASR by up to 48% and improves
efficiency by up to two orders of magnitude. Our framework also enables us to
analyze how different attack algorithms affect output harm distributions.
Surprisingly, we find that most optimization strategies have little effect on
output harmfulness. Finally, we introduce a data-free proof-of-concept
objective based on entropy-maximization to demonstrate how our tail-aware
perspective enables new optimization targets. Overall, our findings highlight
the importance of tail-aware attacks and evaluation protocols to accurately
assess and strengthen LLM safety.

Conclusion: 该理论为迁移学习提供了新的视角，揭示了特征重用和任务对齐的关键作用。

Abstract: We develop a theory of transfer learning in infinitely wide neural networks
where both the pretraining (source) and downstream (target) task can operate in
a feature learning regime. We analyze both the Bayesian framework, where
learning is described by a posterior distribution over the weights, and
gradient flow training of randomly initialized networks trained with weight
decay. Both settings track how representations evolve in both source and target
tasks. The summary statistics of these theories are adapted feature kernels
which, after transfer learning, depend on data and labels from both source and
target tasks. Reuse of features during transfer learning is controlled by an
elastic weight coupling which controls the reliance of the network on features
learned during training on the source task. We apply our theory to linear and
polynomial regression tasks as well as real datasets. Our theory and
experiments reveal interesting interplays between elastic weight coupling,
feature learning strength, dataset size, and source and target task alignment
on the utility of transfer learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于人类反馈的强化学习（RLHF）方法计算成本高、内存需求大且训练不稳定，尤其在大型模型上。

Method: 提出ESSA框架，结合进化策略和低秩适应技术，降低优化维度，提高并行化和内存效率。

Result: 在数学推理任务中，ESSA比梯度方法（如GRPO）收敛更快且数据效率更高。

Conclusion: 进化策略是一种有前景的可扩展对齐方法，为大语言模型的高效后训练提供了新途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly relying on alignment techniques
to ensure that their outputs match human preferences. Although reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) is the dominant approach, it has high
computational costs, memory requirements, and training instability,
particularly when scaling to larger models. This paper introduces ESSA
(Evolutionary Strategies for Scalable Alignment), a new framework that uses
Evolutionary Strategies (ES) to efficiently align LLMs without the need for
gradient computation. ES is well-suited for LLM alignment due to its favorable
properties, such as high parallelizability, memory efficiency, robustness to
sparse rewards, and fewer data samples required for convergence, especially
when starting from a strong pre-trained policy. Moreover, ES eliminates the
need for extensive hyperparameter tuning, making the alignment process simpler
and more stable. Although ES excels in low-dimensional optimization, it poses a
challenge when applied to high-dimensional LLMs. To address this challenge, we
propose a parameter-efficient architectural modification that reduces the
dimensionality of optimization through low-rank adaptation. We evaluated our
approach on mathematical reasoning tasks with verifiable accuracy-based
metrics, demonstrating that ESSA converges faster and is more data efficient
than gradient-based methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our
findings establish ES as a promising and scalable alternative to gradient-based
alignment, paving the way for efficient post-training of large language models.

Abstract: While attribution methods, such as Shapley values, are widely used to explain
the importance of features or training data in traditional machine learning,
their application to Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly within
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, is nascent and challenging. The
primary obstacle is the substantial computational cost, where each utility
function evaluation involves an expensive LLM call, resulting in direct
monetary and time expenses. This paper investigates the feasibility and
effectiveness of adapting Shapley-based attribution to identify influential
retrieved documents in RAG. We compare Shapley with more computationally
tractable approximations and some existing attribution methods for LLM. Our
work aims to: (1) systematically apply established attribution principles to
the RAG document-level setting; (2) quantify how well SHAP approximations can
mirror exact attributions while minimizing costly LLM interactions; and (3)
evaluate their practical explainability in identifying critical documents,
especially under complex inter-document relationships such as redundancy,
complementarity, and synergy. This study seeks to bridge the gap between
powerful attribution techniques and the practical constraints of LLM-based RAG
systems, offering insights into achieving reliable and affordable RAG
explainability.

Method: LoSiA通过梯度稀疏分析动态定位关键子网络并优化，减少矩阵乘法；LoSiA-Pro进一步降低训练延迟。

Result: LoSiA性能接近全微调，训练时间最短，且在持续训练中减少遗忘。

Conclusion: LoSiA是一种高效且性能优越的参数微调方法，适用于领域专业化和常识推理任务。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, significantly
reduce the number of trainable parameters by introducing low-rank decomposition
matrices. However, existing methods perform extensive matrix multiplications in
domain specialization tasks, resulting in computational inefficiency and
sub-optimal fine-tuning performance. Hence, we propose LoSiA(Low-Resources
Subnet Integration Adaptation), an innovative method that dynamically localizes
and optimizes critical parameters during the training process. Specifically, it
identifies a sub-network using gradient sparsity analysis and optimizes it as
the trainable target. This design enables effective high-rank adaptation by
updating only the sub-network parameters, reducing the additional matrix
multiplication. We also present LoSiA-Pro, a faster implementation of LoSiA,
which reduces the training latency by about $27\%$ compared to LoRA. Extensive
evaluations show that our method achieves minimal performance drop compared to
full fine-tuning, while requiring the least training time across domain
specialization and common-sense reasoning tasks. Further analysis shows that
LoSiA also reduces forgetting during continued training.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的上下文异常检测框架（NS），通过建模不确定性和提供置信区间，提高了检测准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未充分建模上下文变量对目标变量的影响及其不确定性，限制了检测效果。

Method: 基于异方差高斯过程回归，将Z-score视为随机变量，生成置信区间。

Result: 在基准数据集和心脏病应用中，NS优于现有方法，检测准确性和可解释性更高。

Conclusion: NS框架通过不确定性建模和自适应决策，适用于医疗等关键领域。

Abstract: Contextual anomaly detection (CAD) aims to identify anomalies in a target
(behavioral) variable conditioned on a set of contextual variables that
influence the normalcy of the target variable but are not themselves indicators
of anomaly. In many anomaly detection tasks, there exist contextual variables
that influence the normalcy of the target variable but are not themselves
indicators of anomaly. In this work, we propose a novel framework for CAD,
normalcy score (NS), that explicitly models both the aleatoric and epistemic
uncertainties. Built on heteroscedastic Gaussian process regression, our method
regards the Z-score as a random variable, providing confidence intervals that
reflect the reliability of the anomaly assessment. Through experiments on
benchmark datasets and a real-world application in cardiology, we demonstrate
that NS outperforms state-of-the-art CAD methods in both detection accuracy and
interpretability. Moreover, confidence intervals enable an adaptive,
uncertainty-driven decision-making process, which may be very important in
domains such as healthcare.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型预训练模型（如LLMs）存在计算冗余，模型压缩可降低成本而不显著影响性能。

Method: 将神经元宽度缩减问题建模为离散最优传输问题，结合熵正则化和矩阵分解，压缩模型权重。

Result: DOTResize在多种LLM家族和规模上优于现有剪枝技术，显著降低实际计算成本。

Conclusion: DOTResize通过最优传输理论有效压缩模型，保留了有用信号，性能优于传统剪枝方法。

Abstract: Model compression offers a promising path to reducing the cost and
inaccessibility of large pre-trained models, without significantly compromising
their impressive performance. Large Transformer models, including large
language models (LLMs), often contain computational redundancy, which can serve
as a target for new model compression methods. In this work, we specifically
target neuron-level redundancies in model layers by combining groups of similar
neurons into fewer neurons. We frame this width reduction as a Discrete Optimal
Transport problem, and propose DOTResize, a novel Transformer compression
method that uses optimal transport theory to transform and compress model
weights. To ensure applicability within the Transformer architecture, we
motivate and incorporate entropic regularization and matrix factorization into
the transportation maps produced by our method. Unlike pruning-based approaches
which discard neurons based on importance measures, DOTResize re-projects the
entire neuron width, allowing the retention and redistribution of useful signal
across the reduced layer. Empirical results show that compared to simple or
state-of-the-art neuron width-pruning techniques, DOTResize can outperform
these methods across multiple LLM families and sizes, while achieving
measurable reductions in real-world computational cost.

Abstract: Efficient spectrum utilization is critical to meeting the growing data
demands of modern wireless communication networks. Automatic Modulation
Classification (AMC) plays a key role in enhancing spectrum efficiency by
accurately identifying modulation schemes in received signals-an essential
capability for dynamic spectrum allocation and interference mitigation,
particularly in cognitive radio (CR) systems. With the increasing deployment of
smart edge devices, such as IoT nodes with limited computational and memory
resources, there is a pressing need for lightweight AMC models that balance low
complexity with high classification accuracy. This paper proposes a
low-complexity, lightweight deep learning (DL) AMC model optimized for
resource-constrained edge devices. We introduce a dual-path deep residual
shrinkage network (DP-DRSN) with Garrote thresholding for effective signal
denoising and design a compact hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture comprising only
27,000 training parameters. The proposed model achieves average classification
accuracies of 61.20%, 63.78%, and 62.13% on the RML2016.10a, RML2016.10b, and
RML2018.01a datasets, respectively demonstrating a strong balance between model

Result: 实验显示30毫秒级推理延迟，并在多种配置下实现准确的CIR预测。

Conclusion: 该方法具有实时适应性和可解释性，适用于6G网络规划和无线数字孪生平台。

Abstract: We present Photon Splatting, a physics-guided neural surrogate model for
real-time wireless channel prediction in complex environments. The proposed
framework introduces surface-attached virtual sources, referred to as photons,
which carry directional wave signatures informed by the scene geometry and
transmitter configuration. At runtime, channel impulse responses (CIRs) are
predicted by splatting these photons onto the angular domain of the receiver
using a geodesic rasterizer. The model is trained to learn a physically
grounded representation that maps transmitter-receiver configurations to full
channel responses. Once trained, it generalizes to new transmitter positions,
antenna beam patterns, and mobile receivers without requiring model retraining.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework through a series of
experiments, from canonical 3D scenes to a complex indoor cafe with 1,000
receivers. Results show 30 millisecond-level inference latency and accurate CIR
predictions across a wide range of configurations. The approach supports
real-time adaptability and interpretability, making it a promising candidate
for wireless digital twin platforms and future 6G network planning.

Abstract: We present any4, a learned 4-bit weight quantization solution for large

compared to other related 4-bit numeric representation types: int4, fp4 and
nf4, as evaluated on a range of model sizes, generations and families (Llama 2,
Llama 3, Mistral and Mixtral). While any4 does not require preprocessing of
weights or activations, it is also competitive with orthogonal techniques that
require such preprocessing (e.g., AWQ and GPTQ). We also experiment with any3
and any2 and show competitiveness at lower bits. Additionally, we show that we
can calibrate using a single curated diverse sample rather than hundreds of
samples from a dataset as done in most quantization approaches. We also open
source tinygemm, a latency optimized GPU matrix multiplication library for
LLMs, that implements any4 using a GPU-efficient lookup table strategy along
with other common quantization methods. We open source our code at

Motivation: 解决扩散模型在低IPC设置下生成样本多样性不足的问题，从信息论角度优化数据集蒸馏。

Result: 在Tiny ImageNet和ImageNet子集上，IGDS显著优于现有方法，尤其在低IPC情况下。

Conclusion: IGDS通过信息论优化有效提升了数据集蒸馏的性能，尤其在低IPC场景下表现突出。

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to create a compact dataset that retains essential
information while maintaining model performance. Diffusion models (DMs) have
shown promise for this task but struggle in low images-per-class (IPC)
settings, where generated samples lack diversity. In this paper, we address
this issue from an information-theoretic perspective by identifying two key
types of information that a distilled dataset must preserve: ($i$) prototype
information $\mathrm{I}(X;Y)$, which captures label-relevant features; and
($ii$) contextual information $\mathrm{H}(X | Y)$, which preserves intra-class
variability. Here, $(X,Y)$ represents the pair of random variables
corresponding to the input data and its ground truth label, respectively.
Observing that the required contextual information scales with IPC, we propose
maximizing $\mathrm{I}(X;Y) + \beta \mathrm{H}(X | Y)$ during the DM sampling
process, where $\beta$ is IPC-dependent. Since directly computing
$\mathrm{I}(X;Y)$ and $\mathrm{H}(X | Y)$ is intractable, we develop
variational estimations to tightly lower-bound these quantities via a
data-driven approach. Our approach, information-guided diffusion sampling
(IGDS), seamlessly integrates with diffusion models and improves dataset
distillation across all IPC settings. Experiments on Tiny ImageNet and ImageNet
subsets show that IGDS significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly
in low-IPC regimes. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: MLLM-SC通过语义引导和自适应资源分配，实现了高效的任务导向无线通信。

Abstract: 6G networks promise revolutionary immersive communication experiences
including augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and holographic
communications. These applications demand high-dimensional multimodal data
transmission and intelligent data processing in real-time, which is extremely
challenging over resource-limited wireless communication systems. Moreover, a
joint understanding of the environment, context, and user intent is essential
to deliver task-relevant content effectively. This article presents a novel
multimodal large language model (MLLM) integrated semantic communications
framework, termed MLLM-SC, which fully leverages reasoning and generative
capabilities of pre-trained foundation models for context-aware and
task-oriented wireless communication. The MLLM-SC framework adopts a
device-edge collaborative architecture. At the edge, MLLM-empowered semantic
guidance module analyzes multimodal inputs, user intents, and channel
conditions to generate importance-aware attention maps prioritizing
semantically critical information. An importance-aware semantic encoder and a
resource-adaptive semantic decoder are jointly designed and optimized, which
can utilize the semantic guidance for adaptive bandwidth allocation and
high-quality content reconstruction or generation. Extensive case studies on
visual question answering for AR/VR applications and diffusion-driven image
generation validate the effectiveness of MLLM-SC.

Motivation: 传统网格搜索调整自编码器隐藏层大小耗时且计算量大，需要更高效的方法。

Method: 基于物理概念的自组织稀疏自编码器（SOSAE），通过惩罚特征向量的幅度和位置索引，动态优化特征空间维度。

Result: 实验表明，SOSAE在保持性能的同时，将特征空间维度的调整计算量减少至其他基线的1/130。

Conclusion: SOSAE提供了一种高效且性能优越的自编码器特征空间优化方法。

Abstract: The process of tuning the size of the hidden layers for autoencoders has the
benefit of providing optimally compressed representations for the input data.
However, such hyper-parameter tuning process would take a lot of computation
and time effort with grid search as the default option. In this paper, we
introduce the Self-Organization Regularization for Autoencoders that
dynamically adapts the dimensionality of the feature space to the optimal size.
Inspired by physics concepts, Self-Organizing Sparse AutoEncoder (SOSAE)
induces sparsity in feature space in a structured way that permits the
truncation of the non-active part of the feature vector without any loss of
information. This is done by penalizing the autoencoder based on the magnitude
and the positional index of the feature vector dimensions, which during
training constricts the feature space in both terms. Extensive experiments on
various datasets show that our SOSAE can tune the feature space dimensionality
up to 130 times lesser Floating-point Operations (FLOPs) than other baselines
while maintaining the same quality of tuning and performance.

Abstract: To address the challenges posed by the heavy reliance of multi-output models
on preset probability distributions and embedded prior knowledge in
non-injective regression tasks, this paper proposes a cycle consistency-based
data-driven training framework. The method jointly optimizes a forward model
{\Phi}: X to Y and a backward model {\Psi}: Y to X, where the cycle consistency
loss is defined as L _cycleb equal L(Y reduce {\Phi}({\Psi}(Y))) (and vice
versa). By minimizing this loss, the framework establishes a closed-loop
mechanism integrating generation and validation phases, eliminating the need
for manual rule design or prior distribution assumptions. Experiments on
normalized synthetic and simulated datasets demonstrate that the proposed
method achieves a cycle reconstruction error below 0.003, achieving an
improvement of approximately 30% in evaluation metrics compared to baseline
models without cycle consistency. Furthermore, the framework supports
unsupervised learning and significantly reduces reliance on manual
intervention, demonstrating potential advantages in non-injective regression
tasks.

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged as a powerful approach for
automating neural network design. However, existing NAS methods face critical
limitations in real-world deployments: architectures lack adaptability across
scenarios, each deployment context requires costly separate searches, and
performance consistency across diverse platforms remains challenging. We
propose DANCE (Dynamic Architectures with Neural Continuous Evolution), which
reformulates architecture search as a continuous evolution problem through
learning distributions over architectural components. DANCE introduces three
key innovations: a continuous architecture distribution enabling smooth
adaptation, a unified architecture space with learned selection gates for
efficient sampling, and a multi-stage training strategy for effective
deployment optimization. Extensive experiments across five datasets demonstrate
DANCE's effectiveness. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art NAS
approaches in terms of accuracy while significantly reducing search costs.
Under varying computational constraints, DANCE maintains robust performance
while smoothly adapting architectures to different hardware requirements. The

Conclusion: SEED通过自进化蒸馏有效解决了LVLM的幻觉问题，提升了模型性能，且避免了传统蒸馏方法的输出空间空洞问题。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
advancements in numerous areas such as multimedia. However, hallucination
issues significantly limit their credibility and application potential.
Existing mitigation methods typically rely on external tools or the comparison
of multi-round inference, which significantly increase inference time. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{SE}lf-\textbf{E}volving \textbf{D}istillation
(\textbf{SEED}), which identifies hallucinations within the inner knowledge of
LVLMs, isolates and purges them, and then distills the purified knowledge back
into the model, enabling self-evolution. Furthermore, we identified that
traditional distillation methods are prone to inducing void spaces in the
output space of LVLMs. To address this issue, we propose a Mode-Seeking
Evolving approach, which performs distillation to capture the dominant modes of
the purified knowledge distribution, thereby avoiding the chaotic results that
could emerge from void spaces. Moreover, we introduce a Hallucination
Elimination Adapter, which corrects the dark knowledge of the original model by
learning purified knowledge. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks
validate the superiority of our SEED, demonstrating substantial improvements in
mitigating hallucinations for representative LVLM models such as LLaVA-1.5 and
InternVL2. Remarkably, the F1 score of LLaVA-1.5 on the hallucination
evaluation metric POPE-Random improved from 81.3 to 88.3.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络在训练过程中会逐渐失去学习新信息的能力（塑性损失），而无界权重增长是主要原因之一。现有方法如重新初始化网络会导致已学信息丢失。

Method: 提出SWR方法，通过在学习过程中逐步缩放权重，防止无界权重增长，同时保留已学信息。

Conclusion: SWR是一种有效的方法，能够在不丢失信息的情况下恢复神经网络的塑性，并在多种学习任务中取得更好的表现。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that as training progresses, neural networks
gradually lose their capacity to learn new information, a phenomenon known as
plasticity loss. An unbounded weight growth is one of the main causes of
plasticity loss. Furthermore, it harms generalization capability and disrupts
optimization dynamics. Re-initializing the network can be a solution, but it
results in the loss of learned information, leading to performance drops. In
this paper, we propose Soft Weight Rescaling (SWR), a novel approach that
prevents unbounded weight growth without losing information. SWR recovers the
plasticity of the network by simply scaling down the weight at each step of the
learning process. We theoretically prove that SWR bounds weight magnitude and

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MJKAN是一种新型神经网络层，结合了KANs的非线性表达能力和MLPs的效率，通过FiLM机制和RBF激活函数改进KANs的计算成本和性能问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs)在计算成本和分类任务性能上的局限性。

Method: 提出MJKAN，结合FiLM机制和RBF激活函数，形成混合架构。

Result: 在函数回归任务中表现优于MLPs，但在图像和文本分类中需调整基础函数数量以避免过拟合。

Conclusion: MJKAN继承了KANs的理论优势，同时提升了计算效率和实用性。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have garnered attention for replacing fixed
activation functions with learnable univariate functions, but they exhibit
practical limitations, including high computational costs and performance
deficits in general classification tasks. In this paper, we propose the
Modulation Joint KAN (MJKAN), a novel neural network layer designed to overcome
these challenges. MJKAN integrates a FiLM (Feature-wise Linear Modulation)-like
mechanism with Radial Basis Function (RBF) activations, creating a hybrid
architecture that combines the non-linear expressive power of KANs with the
efficiency of Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs). We empirically validated MJKAN's
performance across a diverse set of benchmarks, including function regression,
image classification (MNIST, CIFAR-10/100), and natural language processing (AG
News, SMS Spam). The results demonstrate that MJKAN achieves superior
approximation capabilities in function regression tasks, significantly
outperforming MLPs, with performance improving as the number of basis functions
increases. Conversely, in image and text classification, its performance was
competitive with MLPs but revealed a critical dependency on the number of basis
functions. We found that a smaller basis size was crucial for better
generalization, highlighting that the model's capacity must be carefully tuned
to the complexity of the data to prevent overfitting. In conclusion, MJKAN
offers a flexible architecture that inherits the theoretical advantages of KANs
while improving computational efficiency and practical viability.

TL;DR: CB-RM框架通过可解释的概念分解奖励预测，结合主动学习策略提升样本效率，在UltraFeedback数据集上表现优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决标准RLHF方法中奖励函数不透明的问题，实现更透明、可审计且与人类对齐的奖励模型。

Method: 引入概念瓶颈奖励模型（CB-RM），通过动态获取信息量最大的概念标签的主动学习策略提升效率。

Result: 在UltraFeedback数据集上，CB-RM在可解释性和样本效率上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CB-RM为透明、可审计且与人类对齐的奖励模型提供了有效框架。

Abstract: We introduce Concept Bottleneck Reward Models (CB-RM), a reward modeling
framework that enables interpretable preference learning through selective
concept annotation. Unlike standard RLHF methods that rely on opaque reward
functions, CB-RM decomposes reward prediction into human-interpretable
concepts. To make this framework efficient in low-supervision settings, we
formalize an active learning strategy that dynamically acquires the most
informative concept labels. We propose an acquisition function based on
Expected Information Gain and show that it significantly accelerates concept
learning without compromising preference accuracy. Evaluated on the
UltraFeedback dataset, our method outperforms baselines in interpretability and
sample efficiency, marking a step towards more transparent, auditable, and
human-aligned reward models.

Motivation: 探索通用LLM在生成高性能计算代码（如BLAS）方面的潜力，以验证其能否替代或辅助人工编程。

Method: 使用GPT-4.1和o4-mini生成不同优化级别的BLAS代码（C语言），包括无优化、基础优化（并行化、向量化、缓存分块）以及基于Fortran参考代码的优化。

Result: LLM能生成多数正确的代码，且优化后的代码性能优于参考代码。

Conclusion: LLM在生成高性能计算代码方面具有潜力，尤其在代码优化方面表现突出。

Abstract: Generative AI technology based on Large Language Models (LLM) has been
developed and applied to assist or automatically generate program codes. In
this paper, we evaluate the capability of existing general LLMs for Basic
Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) code generation for CPUs. We use two LLMs
provided by OpenAI: GPT-4.1, a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model,
and o4-mini, one of the o-series of Reasoning models. Both have been released
in April 2025. For the routines from level-1 to 3 BLAS, we tried to generate
(1) C code without optimization from routine name only, (2) C code with basic
performance optimizations (thread parallelization, SIMD vectorization, and
cache blocking) from routine name only, and (3) C code with basic performance
optimizations based on Fortran reference code. As a result, we found that
correct code can be generated in many cases even when only routine name are
given. We also confirmed that thread parallelization with OpenMP, SIMD
vectorization, and cache blocking can be implemented to some extent, and that
the code is faster than the reference code.

Conclusion: 该框架为实现未来城市环境中的通用LLM智能体迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Urban general intelligence (UGI) refers to the capacity of AI systems to
autonomously perceive, reason, and act within dynamic and complex urban
environments. In this paper, we introduce UrbanMind, a tool-enhanced
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework designed to facilitate UGI.
Central to UrbanMind is a novel architecture based on Continual
Retrieval-Augmented MoE-based LLM (C-RAG-LLM), which dynamically incorporates
domain-specific knowledge and evolving urban data to support long-term
adaptability. The architecture of C-RAG-LLM aligns naturally with a multilevel
optimization framework, where different layers are treated as interdependent
sub-problems. Each layer has distinct objectives and can be optimized either
independently or jointly through a hierarchical learning process. The framework
is highly flexible, supporting both end-to-end training and partial layer-wise
optimization based on resource or deployment constraints. To remain adaptive
under data drift, it is further integrated with an incremental corpus updating
mechanism. Evaluations on real-world urban tasks of a variety of complexity
verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. This work presents a
promising step toward the realization of general-purpose LLM agents in future
urban environments.

Conclusion: 在需要限制感受野的应用（如基于扩散的轨迹生成）中，应谨慎使用归一化层。

Abstract: This work shows that normalization layers can facilitate a surprising degree
of communication across the spatial dimensions of an input tensor. We study a
toy localization task with a convolutional architecture and show that
normalization layers enable an iterative message passing procedure, allowing
information aggregation from well outside the local receptive field. Our
results suggest that normalization layers should be employed with caution in
applications such as diffusion-based trajectory generation, where maintaining a
spatially limited receptive field is crucial.

Conclusion: ABench-Physics为提升LLMs的科学推理能力提供了挑战性和诊断性框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in domains
such as mathematics and programming, yet their capabilities in physics remain
underexplored and poorly understood. Physics poses unique challenges that
demand not only precise computation but also deep conceptual understanding and
physical modeling skills. Existing benchmarks often fall short due to limited
difficulty, multiple-choice formats, and static evaluation settings that fail
to capture physical modeling ability. In this paper, we introduce
ABench-Physics, a novel benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate LLMs'
physical reasoning and generalization capabilities. ABench-Physics consists of
two components: Phy_A, a static set of 400 graduate- or Olympiad-level
problems; and Phy_B, a dynamic subset of 100 problems equipped with an
automatic variation engine to test model robustness across changing conditions.
All questions require precise numerical answers, with strict formatting and
tolerance constraints. Our evaluation of several state-of-the-art LLMs reveals
substantial performance gaps, highlighting persistent limitations in physical
reasoning, especially in generalization to dynamic variants. ABench-Physics
provides a challenging and diagnostic framework for advancing scientific
reasoning in LLMs.

Motivation: 数据异构性（特别是特征漂移）在联邦学习中会导致全局模型性能下降，影响个性化本地模型。

Method: 利用原型对抗学习统一特征空间，通过协作学习增强特征中的类别信息，并混合全局原型和本地特征以增强全局分类器。

Result: 在三个特征漂移数据集上的评估显示，FedPall在分类任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: FedPall有效解决了联邦学习中的特征漂移问题，提升了分类性能。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training of a global model in
the centralized server with data from multiple parties while preserving
privacy. However, data heterogeneity can significantly degrade the performance
of the global model when each party uses datasets from different sources to
train a local model, thereby affecting personalized local models. Among various
cases of data heterogeneity, feature drift, feature space difference among
parties, is prevalent in real-life data but remains largely unexplored. Feature
drift can distract feature extraction learning in clients and thus lead to poor
feature extraction and classification performance. To tackle the problem of
feature drift in FL, we propose FedPall, an FL framework that utilizes
prototype-based adversarial learning to unify feature spaces and collaborative
learning to reinforce class information within the features. Moreover, FedPall
leverages mixed features generated from global prototypes and local features to
enhance the global classifier with classification-relevant information from a
global perspective. Evaluation results on three representative feature-drifted
datasets demonstrate FedPall's consistently superior performance in
classification with feature-drifted data in the FL scenario.

Motivation: 解决因成本限制无法获取大规模标注数据的问题，避免小数据集导致的模型结果不稳定、过拟合和伪相关性学习。

Result: 该方法在小规模、类别不平衡或具有伪特征的数据上，能更快收敛到更准确可靠的模型。

Conclusion: 通过结合解释信号，该方法在小数据集上显著提升了模型的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Acquiring and training on large-scale labeled data can be impractical due to
cost constraints. Additionally, the use of small training datasets can result
in considerable variability in model outcomes, overfitting, and learning of
spurious correlations. A crucial shortcoming of data labels is their lack of
any reasoning behind a specific label assignment, causing models to learn any
arbitrary classification rule as long as it aligns data with labels. To
overcome these issues, we introduce an innovative approach for training
reliable classification models on smaller datasets, by using simple explanation
signals such as important input features from labeled data. Our method centers
around a two-stage training cycle that alternates between enhancing model
prediction accuracy and refining its attention to match the explanations. This
instructs models to grasp the rationale behind label assignments during their
learning phase. We demonstrate that our training cycle expedites the
convergence towards more accurate and reliable models, particularly for small,
class-imbalanced training data, or data with spurious features.

Abstract: The growing adoption of domain-specific architectures in edge computing
platforms for deep learning has highlighted the efficiency of hardware
accelerators. However, integrating custom accelerators into modern machine
learning (ML) compilers remains a complex challenge due to the need for
significant modifications in compilation layers and specialized scheduling
techniques. Existing frameworks offer partial solutions and require users to
navigate intricate compiler internals.
  In this paper, we introduce a TVM-based compilation integration approach that
targets GEMM-based deep learning accelerators. Our approach abstracts the
complexities of compiler integration, enabling seamless integration of
accelerators without requiring in-depth knowledge of the underlying compiler.
Furthermore, we extend and incorporate design space exploration tools,
specifically CoSA, to automate efficient tensor scheduling, accounting for
factors such as uneven mapping and double buffering. Our framework is
benchmarked on the Gemmini accelerator, demonstrating performance comparable to
its specialized manually implemented toolchain.

Conclusion: 该方法高效、兼容性强，且在多个领域显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have demonstrated great promise in modeling various
sequence data, ranging from human language to biological sequences. Inspired by
the success of RL in language models, there is growing interest in further
improving the models by alignment with a certain reward. In this work, we
propose a novel preference optimization method for masked discrete diffusion
models through a principled diffusion trajectory alignment. Instead of applying
the reward on the final output and backpropagating the gradient to the entire
discrete denoising process, we decompose the problem into a set of stepwise
alignment objectives. This framework enables efficient diffusion optimization,
is compatible with arbitrary reward functions, and importantly, guarantees an
equivalent optimal solution under additive factorization of the trajectory
reward. Experiments across multiple domains including DNA sequence design,
protein inverse folding, and language modeling consistently demonstrate the
superiority of our approach. Notably, it achieves an up to 12\% improvement
over the most competitive RL-based baseline in terms of predicted activity on
DNA sequence design, and further improves the GSM8K score from 78.6 to 80.7 on
LLaDA-8B-Instruct for language modeling.

Result: 在公开数据集上，NTSFormer在多模态冷启动节点分类任务中表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: NTSFormer通过自学习和多模态融合，有效解决了冷启动节点的挑战，为相关任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Cold-start node classification on multimodal graphs is challenging because
cold-start nodes are isolated (i.e., no edges) and often have missing
modalities (e.g., absent text or image features). Existing methods address
structural isolation by degrading graph learning models to MLPs for cold-start
inference, using a teacher model (with graph access) to guide the MLP. However,
this results in limited model capacity in the student, which is further
challenged when modalities are missing. In this paper, we propose
Neighbor-to-Self Graph Transformer (NTSFormer), a unified Graph Transformer
framework that jointly tackles the isolation and missing-modality issues via a
self-teaching paradigm. Specifically, NTSFormer uses a cold-start attention
mask to simultaneously make two predictions for each node: a "student"
prediction based only on self-information (i.e., the node's own features), and
a "teacher" prediction incorporating both self and neighbor information. This
enables the model to supervise itself without degrading to an MLP, thereby
fully leveraging the Transformer's capacity to handle missing modalities. To
handle diverse graph information and missing modalities, NTSFormer performs a
one-time multimodal graph pre-computation that converts structural and feature
data into token sequences, which are then processed by a Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) Input Projection and Transformer layers for effective fusion.
Experimental results on public datasets show that NTSFormer achieves superior
performance on multimodal cold-start node classification tasks.

Motivation: DRL系统在安全关键应用中广泛使用，但其安全性研究不足，尤其是后门攻击的潜在威胁。

Method: 提出了两种攻击方法：TrojanentRL（利用组件级漏洞植入持久后门）和InfrectroRL（无需训练数据的后训练攻击）。

Result: 在六个Atari环境中，这些攻击效果与现有训练时攻击相当，且能绕过主流防御。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了当前后门攻击的研究方向，强调了开发更鲁棒防御的紧迫性。

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) systems are increasingly used in
safety-critical applications, yet their security remains severely
underexplored. This work investigates backdoor attacks, which implant hidden
triggers that cause malicious actions only when specific inputs appear in the
observation space. Existing DRL backdoor research focuses solely on
training-time attacks requiring unrealistic access to the training pipeline. In
contrast, we reveal critical vulnerabilities across the DRL supply chain where
backdoors can be embedded with significantly reduced adversarial privileges. We
introduce two novel attacks: (1) TrojanentRL, which exploits component-level
flaws to implant a persistent backdoor that survives full model retraining; and
(2) InfrectroRL, a post-training backdoor attack which requires no access to
training, validation, nor test data. Empirical and analytical evaluations
across six Atari environments show our attacks rival state-of-the-art
training-time backdoor attacks while operating under much stricter adversarial
constraints. We also demonstrate that InfrectroRL further evades two leading
DRL backdoor defenses. These findings challenge the current research focus and
highlight the urgent need for robust defenses.

Abstract: Deploying language models (LMs) in customer-facing speech applications
requires conversational fluency and adherence to specific stylistic guidelines.
This can be challenging to achieve reliably using complex system prompts due to
issues like instruction following limitations and in-context bias. This study
investigates the effectiveness of fine-tuning versus system prompting for
aligning LMs with a specific behavioral target: responding in a natural,
conversational tone suitable for voice interactions. We fine-tuned a small,
open-weights model (`Llama3.2-1B-Instruct`) using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on
a synthetically generated dataset derived from Wikipedia. Additionally, we
fine-tuned two closed-source models (`gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-4.1-mini`). Our
results demonstrate that fine-tuning outperformed system prompting, achieving a
high percentage of conversational responses, even when trained on only 100 data
samples. Semantic similarity analysis confirmed that fine-tuning did not
degrade content quality. Interestingly, fine-tuning with 8-bit integer
quantization converged faster towards the target style than using bfloat16
precision, potentially due to implicit regularization effects. We conclude that
fine-tuning small, open-weights LMs on simulated data is a highly effective and
data-efficient method for instilling specific stylistic behaviors, offering a
preferable alternative to complex system prompting for practical applications
requiring nuanced response styles.

Abstract: Reasoning about the trajectories of multiple, interacting objects is integral
to physical reasoning tasks in machine learning. This involves conditions
imposed on the objects at different time steps, for instance initial states or
desired goal states. Existing approaches in physical reasoning generally rely
on autoregressive modeling, which can only be conditioned on initial states,
but not on later states. In fields such as planning for reinforcement learning,
similar challenges are being addressed with denoising diffusion models. In this
work, we propose an object-centric denoising diffusion model architecture for
physical reasoning that is translation equivariant over time, permutation
equivariant over objects, and can be conditioned on arbitrary time steps for
arbitrary objects. We demonstrate how this model can solve tasks with multiple
conditions and examine its performance when changing object numbers and
trajectory lengths during inference.

Result: 在真实数据集上，ConBatch-BAL策略减少了主动学习迭代和数据获取成本，甚至优于无约束基线。

Conclusion: ConBatch-BAL策略在实际应用中能有效降低成本并提升效率。

Abstract: Varying annotation costs among data points and budget constraints can hinder
the adoption of active learning strategies in real-world applications. This
work introduces two Bayesian active learning strategies for batch acquisition
under constraints (ConBatch-BAL), one based on dynamic thresholding and one
following greedy acquisition. Both select samples using uncertainty metrics
computed via Bayesian neural networks. The dynamic thresholding strategy
redistributes the budget across the batch, while the greedy one selects the
top-ranked sample at each step, limited by the remaining budget. Focusing on
scenarios with costly data annotation and geospatial constraints, we also
release two new real-world datasets containing geolocated aerial images of
buildings, annotated with energy efficiency or typology classes. The
ConBatch-BAL strategies are benchmarked against a random acquisition baseline
on these datasets under various budget and cost scenarios. The results show
that the developed ConBatch-BAL strategies can reduce active learning
iterations and data acquisition costs in real-world settings, and even
outperform the unconstrained baseline solutions.

Abstract: T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires encode critical immunological signatures
for autoimmune diseases, yet their clinical application remains limited by
sequence sparsity and low witness rates. We developed EAMil, a multi-instance
deep learning framework that leverages TCR sequencing data to diagnose systemic
lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with exceptional
accuracy. By integrating PrimeSeq feature extraction with ESMonehot encoding
and enhanced gate attention mechanisms, our model achieved state-of-the-art
performance with AUCs of 98.95% for SLE and 97.76% for RA. EAMil successfully
identified disease-associated genes with over 90% concordance with established
differential analyses and effectively distinguished disease-specific TCR genes.
The model demonstrated robustness in classifying multiple disease categories,
utilizing the SLEDAI score to stratify SLE patients by disease severity as well
as to diagnose the site of damage in SLE patients, and effectively controlling
for confounding factors such as age and gender. This interpretable framework
for immune receptor analysis provides new insights for autoimmune disease
detection and classification with broad potential clinical applications across

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于大规模非结构化数据集的训练方法存在存储成本高、质量评估难、隐私和伦理问题。

Method: 利用多个小规模、领域特定数据集，结合元学习训练上下文学习模型，并在不同设置下验证其性能。

Result: 模型在训练域外泛化能力更强，性能与传统方法相当，且在模块化和可替换性方面具有优势。

Conclusion: 通过精心策划的数据集集合训练，Transformer模型仍能实现良好的上下文预测泛化能力，同时解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: In-context learning enables transformer models to generalize to new tasks
based solely on input prompts, without any need for weight updates. However,
existing training paradigms typically rely on large, unstructured datasets that
are costly to store, difficult to evaluate for quality and balance, and pose
privacy and ethical concerns due to the inclusion of sensitive information.
Motivated by these limitations and risks, we propose an alternative training
strategy where we leverage a collection of multiple, small-scale, and
domain-specific datasets. We empirically demonstrate that the increased quality
and diversity of such data improve the generalization abilities of in-context
learners beyond their training domain, while achieving comparable performance
with models trained on a single large-scale dataset. We investigate this
paradigm by leveraging meta-learning to train an in-context learner on the
Meta-Album collection under several settings. Firstly, we show the performance
in a controlled environment, where the test domain is completely excluded from
the training knowledge. Secondly, we explore the robustness of these models to
forgetting in a continual scenario where the information is accessible for a
limited time. Finally, we explore the more challenging unsupervised scenario.
Our findings demonstrate that transformers still generalize for in-context
prediction when trained on a curated dataset collection while offering
advantages in modularity and replaceability.

Motivation: 研究神经网络性能与计算成本之间的缩放关系，探索其内部机制。

Method: 通过神经切线核（NTK）分析数据和模型规模扩展下的神经网络行为，研究特征学习的消失及其对缩放行为的影响。

Result: 发现性能扩展指数相似时，内部动态可能相反；确定了支持特征学习的最大模型宽度。

Conclusion: 性能扩展不足以解释神经网络机制，需结合内部动态分析；特征学习在有限宽度模型中存在临界点。

Abstract: Scaling laws offer valuable insights into the relationship between neural
network performance and computational cost, yet their underlying mechanisms
remain poorly understood. In this work, we empirically analyze how neural
networks behave under data and model scaling through the lens of the neural
tangent kernel (NTK). This analysis establishes a link between performance
scaling and the internal dynamics of neural networks. Our findings of standard
vision tasks show that similar performance scaling exponents can occur even
though the internal model dynamics show opposite behavior. This demonstrates
that performance scaling alone is insufficient for understanding the underlying
mechanisms of neural networks. We also address a previously unresolved issue in
neural scaling: how convergence to the infinite-width limit affects scaling
behavior in finite-width models. To this end, we investigate how feature
learning is lost as the model width increases and quantify the transition
between kernel-driven and feature-driven scaling regimes. We identify the
maximum model width that supports feature learning, which, in our setups, we
find to be more than ten times smaller than typical large language model
widths.

Conclusion: 多轮交互工具状态的方法在任务中表现出色，为优化推理计算提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances have established a new machine learning paradigm based on
scaling up compute at inference time as well as at training time. In that line
of work, a combination of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on synthetic
demonstrations and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is
used for training Large Language Models to expend extra compute during
inference in the form of "thoughts" expressed in natural language. In this
paper, we propose to instead format these tokens as a multi-turn interaction
trace with a stateful tool. At each turn, the new state of the tool is appended
to the context of the model, whose job is to generate the tokens necessary to
control the tool via a custom DSL. We benchmark this approach on the problem of
repairing malfunctioning Python code, and show that this constrained setup
allows for faster sampling of experience and a denser reward signal, allowing
even models of size up to 3B parameters to learn how to proficiently expend
additional compute on the task.

<details>

Motivation: 高维数据回归问题中，正则化超参数的调整对避免过拟合和保证变量选择至关重要。

Method: 通过分析多任务线性回归中的L1和L2正则化（如岭回归、Lasso和弹性网络），提出分布依赖的泛化误差界限。

Result: 在子高斯分布等假设下，泛化误差界限不随特征维度增加而恶化，且优于传统均匀界限。

Conclusion: 论文提出的分布依赖界限在高维数据下表现更优，并扩展到岭回归的广义形式，进一步提升了界限的紧致性。

Abstract: Modern regression problems often involve high-dimensional data and a careful
tuning of the regularization hyperparameters is crucial to avoid overly complex
models that may overfit the training data while guaranteeing desirable
properties like effective variable selection. We study the recently introduced
direction of tuning regularization hyperparameters in linear regression across
multiple related tasks. We obtain distribution-dependent bounds on the
generalization error for the validation loss when tuning the L1 and L2
coefficients, including ridge, lasso and the elastic net. In contrast, prior
work develops bounds that apply uniformly to all distributions, but such bounds
necessarily degrade with feature dimension, d. While these bounds are shown to
be tight for worst-case distributions, our bounds improve with the "niceness"
of the data distribution. Concretely, we show that under additional assumptions
that instances within each task are i.i.d. draws from broad well-studied
classes of distributions including sub-Gaussians, our generalization bounds do
not get worse with increasing d, and are much sharper than prior work for very
large d. We also extend our results to a generalization of ridge regression,
where we achieve tighter bounds that take into account an estimate of the mean
of the ground truth distribution.

Conclusion: 该方法为自动驾驶测试提供了可扩展的场景选择基础。

Abstract: Scenario-based testing is an indispensable instrument for the comprehensive
validation and verification of automated vehicles (AVs). However, finding a
manageable and finite, yet representative subset of scenarios in a scalable,
possibly unsupervised manner is notoriously challenging. Our work is meant to
constitute a cornerstone to facilitate sample-efficient testing, while still
capturing the diversity of relevant operational design domains (ODDs) and
accounting for the "long tail" phenomenon in particular. To this end, we first
propose an expressive and flexible heterogeneous, spatio-temporal graph model
for representing traffic scenarios. Leveraging recent advances of graph neural
networks (GNNs), we then propose a self-supervised method to learn a universal
embedding space for scenario graphs that enables clustering and similarity
search. In particular, we implement contrastive learning alongside a
bootstrapping-based approach and evaluate their suitability for partitioning
the scenario space. Experiments on the nuPlan dataset confirm the model's
ability to capture semantics and thus group related scenarios in a meaningful
way despite the absence of discrete class labels. Different scenario types
materialize as distinct clusters. Our results demonstrate how variable-length
traffic scenarios can be condensed into single vector representations that
enable nearest-neighbor retrieval of representative candidates for distinct
scenario categories. Notably, this is achieved without manual labeling or bias
towards an explicit objective such as criticality. Ultimately, our approach can
serve as a basis for scalable selection of scenarios to further enhance the
efficiency and robustness of testing AVs in simulation.

Motivation: 现有PPI预测基准主要关注成对评估，忽略了模型重建生物意义网络的能力，这对生物学研究至关重要。

Method: PRING构建了一个高质量的多物种PPI网络数据集，并设计了拓扑和功能导向的评估任务。

Result: 实验表明当前PPI模型在恢复网络结构和功能特性方面存在局限性。

Conclusion: PRING为开发更有效的PPI预测模型提供了可靠平台。

Abstract: Deep learning-based computational methods have achieved promising results in
predicting protein-protein interactions (PPIs). However, existing benchmarks
predominantly focus on isolated pairwise evaluations, overlooking a model's
capability to reconstruct biologically meaningful PPI networks, which is
crucial for biology research. To address this gap, we introduce PRING, the
first comprehensive benchmark that evaluates protein-protein interaction
prediction from a graph-level perspective. PRING curates a high-quality,
multi-species PPI network dataset comprising 21,484 proteins and 186,818
interactions, with well-designed strategies to address both data redundancy and
leakage. Building on this golden-standard dataset, we establish two
complementary evaluation paradigms: (1) topology-oriented tasks, which assess
intra and cross-species PPI network construction, and (2) function-oriented
tasks, including protein complex pathway prediction, GO module analysis, and
essential protein justification. These evaluations not only reflect the model's
capability to understand the network topology but also facilitate protein
function annotation, biological module detection, and even disease mechanism
analysis. Extensive experiments on four representative model categories,
consisting of sequence similarity-based, naive sequence-based, protein language
model-based, and structure-based approaches, demonstrate that current PPI
models have potential limitations in recovering both structural and functional
properties of PPI networks, highlighting the gap in supporting real-world
biological applications. We believe PRING provides a reliable platform to guide
the development of more effective PPI prediction models for the community. The
dataset and source code of PRING are available at

TL;DR: DICE方法是一种生成建模方法，通过学习有限时间点样本群体的演化来捕捉平滑的群体动态，而非复杂的个体轨迹动态。其损失函数具有不变性，训练稳定且高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以捕捉群体动态的平滑性，且训练不稳定。DICE旨在解决这些问题，提供更高效和稳定的建模方法。

Method: DICE通过学习有限时间点的样本群体演化，设计不变性损失函数，直接生成时间区间内的样本轨迹。

Result: DICE在训练稳定性和样本生成效率上显著优于传统方法，适用于多种复杂问题。

Conclusion: DICE是一种高效、稳定的生成建模方法，适用于捕捉群体动态，尤其在复杂系统中表现优异。

Abstract: We introduce the Discrete Inverse Continuity Equation (DICE) method, a
generative modeling approach that learns the evolution of a stochastic process
from given sample populations at a finite number of time points. Models learned
with DICE capture the typically smooth and well-behaved population dynamics,
rather than the dynamics of individual sample trajectories that can exhibit
complex or even chaotic behavior. The DICE loss function is developed
specifically to be invariant, even in discrete time, to spatially constant but
time-varying spurious constants that can emerge during training; this
invariance increases training stability and robustness. Generating a trajectory
of sample populations with DICE is fast because samples evolve directly in the
time interval over which the stochastic process is formulated, in contrast to
approaches that condition on time and then require multiple sampling steps per
time step. DICE is stable to train, in situations where other methods for
learning population dynamics fail, and DICE generates representative samples
with orders of magnitude lower costs than methods that have to condition on
time. Numerical experiments on a wide range of problems from random waves,
Vlasov-Poisson instabilities and high-dimensional chaos are included to justify
these assertions.

Result: 提供了可靠的KFAC实现方法，帮助初学者深入理解并降低实践中的障碍。

Conclusion: 本文为KFAC提供了当代视角，旨在促进其理解、实现和实际应用。

Abstract: Kronecker-factored approximate curvature (KFAC) is arguably one of the most
prominent curvature approximations in deep learning. Its applications range
from optimization to Bayesian deep learning, training data attribution with
influence functions, and model compression or merging. While the intuition
behind KFAC is easy to understand, its implementation is tedious: It comes in
many flavours, has common pitfalls when translating the math to code, and is
challenging to test, which complicates ensuring a properly functioning
implementation. Some of the authors themselves have dealt with these challenges
and experienced the discomfort of not being able to fully test their code.
Thanks to recent advances in understanding KFAC, we are now able to provide
test cases and a recipe for a reliable KFAC implementation. This tutorial is
meant as a ground-up introduction to KFAC. In contrast to the existing work,
our focus lies on providing both math and code side-by-side and providing test
cases based on the latest insights into KFAC that are scattered throughout the
literature. We hope this tutorial provides a contemporary view of KFAC that
allows beginners to gain a deeper understanding of this curvature approximation
while lowering the barrier to its implementation, extension, and usage in
practice.

Abstract: We present a deep learning approach to extract physical parameters (e.g.,
mobility, Schottky contact barrier height, defect profiles) of two-dimensional
(2D) transistors from electrical measurements, enabling automated parameter
extraction and technology computer-aided design (TCAD) fitting. To facilitate
this task, we implement a simple data augmentation and pre-training approach by
training a secondary neural network to approximate a physics-based device
simulator. This method enables high-quality fits after training the neural
network on electrical data generated from physics-based simulations of ~500
devices, a factor >40$\times$ fewer than other recent efforts. Consequently,
fitting can be achieved by training on physically rigorous TCAD models,
including complex geometry, self-consistent transport, and electrostatic
effects, and is not limited to computationally inexpensive compact models. We
apply our approach to reverse-engineer key parameters from experimental
monolayer WS$_2$ transistors, achieving a median coefficient of determination
($R^2$) = 0.99 when fitting measured electrical data. We also demonstrate that
this approach generalizes and scales well by reverse-engineering electrical
data on high-electron-mobility transistors while fitting 35 parameters
simultaneously. To facilitate future research on deep learning approaches for
inverse transistor design, we have published our code and sample data sets
online.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种硬件/软件紧密结合的框架，用于在TinyML硬件上实现神经符号AI（NSAI），解决了符号模型在资源受限硬件上的计算挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型存在不确定性量化和显式规则推理的局限性，神经符号AI（NSAI）旨在解决这些问题。然而，符号模型在TinyML硬件上的稀疏性和计算分辨率与低分辨率、密集的神经模型形成对比，限制了符号模型的规模。

Method: 通过训练硬件高效的概率电路（PCs），使用n次根压缩技术压缩模型，并在TinyML硬件上部署完整的NSAI模型。

Result: 与64位精度基线相比，该框架在FPGA上显著减少了硬件资源（FF减少82.3%，LUT减少52.6%，Flash使用减少18.0%），并在ESP32微控制器上实现了平均4.67倍的推理加速。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了符号模型在TinyML硬件上的计算瓶颈，为嵌入式场景中的NSAI提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Neurosymbolic AI (NSAI) has recently emerged to mitigate limitations
associated with deep learning (DL) models, e.g. quantifying their uncertainty
or reason with explicit rules. Hence, TinyML hardware will need to support
these symbolic models to bring NSAI to embedded scenarios. Yet, although
symbolic models are typically compact, their sparsity and computation
resolution contrasts with low-resolution and dense neuro models, which is a
challenge on resource-constrained TinyML hardware severely limiting the size of
symbolic models that can be computed. In this work, we remove this bottleneck
leveraging a tight hardware/software integration to present a complete
framework to compute NSAI with TinyML hardware. We focus on symbolic models
realized with tractable probabilistic circuits (PCs), a popular subclass of
probabilistic models for hardware integration. This framework: (1) trains a
specific class of hardware-efficient \emph{deterministic} PCs, chosen for the
symbolic task; (2) \emph{compresses} this PC until it can be computed on TinyML
hardware with minimal accuracy degradation, using our $n^{th}$-root compression
technique, and (3) \emph{deploys} the complete NSAI model on TinyML hardware.
Compared to a 64b precision baseline necessary for the PC without compression,
our workflow leads to significant hardware reduction on FPGA (up to 82.3\% in
FF, 52.6\% in LUTs, and 18.0\% in Flash usage) and an average inference speedup
of 4.67x on ESP32 microcontroller.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel generalized Wasserstein-2 distance approach
for efficiently training stochastic neural networks to reconstruct random field

categorical components. We prove that a stochastic neural network can
approximate random field models under a Wasserstein-2 distance metric under
nonrestrictive conditions. Furthermore, this stochastic neural network can be
efficiently trained by minimizing our proposed generalized local squared
Wasserstein-2 loss function. We showcase the effectiveness of our proposed
approach in various uncertainty quantification tasks, including classification,
reconstructing the distribution of mixed random variables, and learning complex
noisy dynamical systems from spatiotemporal data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型基准测试中，模型排名存在矛盾，阻碍了模型选择和比较。

Method: 采用“train-before-test”方法，对61个模型在24个基准上进行统一的基准微调后再评估。

Result: 该方法显著提高了排名一致性，增强了排名的外部有效性，并揭示了基准性能的潜在因素。

Conclusion: 建议将“train-before-test”作为语言模型基准测试的默认组成部分。

Abstract: Existing language model benchmarks provide contradictory model rankings, even
for benchmarks that aim to capture similar skills. This dilemma of conflicting
rankings hampers model selection, clouds model comparisons, and adds confusion
to a growing ecosystem of competing models. Recent work attributed ranking
disagreement to the phenomenon of training on the test task: As released,
different models exhibit a different level of preparation for any given test
task. A candidate solution to the problem is train-before-test: Give each model
the same benchmark-specific finetuning before evaluation. Our primary
contribution is a broad empirical evaluation of train-before-test across 24
benchmarks and 61 models. We show that train-before-test significantly improves
ranking agreement consistently across all benchmarks. Whereas rankings have
little external validity to start with, they enjoy a significant degree of
external validity when applying train-before-test: Model rankings transfer
gracefully from one benchmark to the other. Even within the same model family,
train-before-test reduces strong ranking disagreement to near-perfect
agreement. In addition, train-before-test reduces the model-score matrix to
essentially rank one, revealing new insights into the latent factors of
benchmark performance. Our work supports the recommendation to make
train-before-test a default component of LLM benchmarking.

Result: 揭示了孤立预测任务的局限性，并提出了干预导向的ADS开发和部署方法。

Conclusion: 需要转向干预范式，以更有效地设计和评估ADS在社会系统中的实际影响。

Abstract: Many automated decision systems (ADS) are designed to solve prediction
problems -- where the goal is to learn patterns from a sample of the population
and apply them to individuals from the same population. In reality, these
prediction systems operationalize holistic policy interventions in deployment.
Once deployed, ADS can shape impacted population outcomes through an effective
policy change in how decision-makers operate, while also being defined by past
and present interactions between stakeholders and the limitations of existing
organizational, as well as societal, infrastructure and context. In this work,
we consider the ways in which we must shift from a prediction-focused paradigm
to an interventionist paradigm when considering the impact of ADS within social
systems. We argue this requires a new default problem setup for ADS beyond
prediction, to instead consider predictions as decision support, final
decisions, and outcomes. We highlight how this perspective unifies modern
statistical frameworks and other tools to study the design, implementation, and
evaluation of ADS systems, and point to the research directions necessary to
operationalize this paradigm shift. Using these tools, we characterize the
limitations of focusing on isolated prediction tasks, and lay the foundation
for a more intervention-oriented approach to developing and deploying ADS.

Conclusion: QuEst为分位数分布度量提供了灵活且严谨的推断工具，扩展了混合推断的应用范围。

Abstract: As machine learning models grow increasingly competent, their predictions can
supplement scarce or expensive data in various important domains. In support of
this paradigm, algorithms have emerged to combine a small amount of
high-fidelity observed data with a much larger set of imputed model outputs to
estimate some quantity of interest. Yet current hybrid-inference tools target
only means or single quantiles, limiting their applicability for many critical
domains and use cases. We present QuEst, a principled framework to merge
observed and imputed data to deliver point estimates and rigorous confidence
intervals for a wide family of quantile-based distributional measures. QuEst
covers a range of measures, from tail risk (CVaR) to population segments such
as quartiles, that are central to fields such as economics, sociology,
education, medicine, and more. We extend QuEst to multidimensional metrics, and
introduce an additional optimization technique to further reduce variance in
this and other hybrid estimators. We demonstrate the utility of our framework
through experiments in economic modeling, opinion polling, and language model
auto-evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLM）参数规模的增加，计算资源需求限制了其普及，第三方推理服务兴起但引发隐私担忧。现有SMPC方案开销大且难以扩展。

Method: 提出Cascade协议，利用序列维度分片技术，牺牲部分密码学隐私保证以换取性能和可扩展性提升。

Result: Cascade能抵抗最新攻击，且对基于学习的攻击具有抵抗力，速度比现有方案快多个数量级。

Conclusion: Cascade为现代LLM的安全部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: As LLMs continue to increase in parameter size, the computational resources
required to run them are available to fewer parties. Therefore, third-party
inference services -- where LLMs are hosted by third parties with significant
computational resources -- are becoming increasingly popular. However, third
party inference raises critical concerns about user data privacy. To mitigate
these risks, privacy researchers have developed provably secure schemes for
third-party inference, such as Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC). However,
SMPC protocols have significant computational and communication overhead, and
do not scale to large models. In this work, we propose a new multi-party
inference protocol, Cascade, that avoids these punitive costs by leveraging
sharding in the sequence dimension to maintain privacy, trading off
cryptographic privacy guarantees for increased performance and scalability. We
demonstrate that Cascade is resistant to a generalization of a recent attack
that is highly effective against other statistical privacy schemes, and that it
is further resistant to learning-based attacks. As Cascade is orders of
magnitude faster than existing schemes, our findings offer practical solutions
for secure deployment of modern state-of-the-art LLMs.

### [600] [Logit Reweighting for Topic-Focused Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05235)
*Joschka Braun,Bálint Mucsányi,Seyed Ali Bahrainian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级方法，通过直接重新加权主题相关标记的logits来增强生成摘要的主题相关性，避免了资源密集的微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成符合特定主题的摘要对语言模型仍具挑战性，现有方法要么资源消耗大，要么难以保持主题聚焦。

Method: 提出三种logits重新加权技术：恒定偏移、因子缩放和阈值选择，并在NEWTS数据集上评估。

Result: 实验表明，这些技术有效增加了主题相关词汇的使用，尤其是阈值选择方法在不影响摘要质量的情况下提升了主题聚焦。

Conclusion: 直接重新加权logits是一种实用且资源高效的替代微调方法，为精确控制生成文本的主题内容提供了新途径。

Abstract: Generating abstractive summaries that adhere to a specific topic remains a
significant challenge for language models. While standard approaches, such as
fine-tuning, are resource-intensive, simpler methods like prompt engineering
often struggle to maintain topical focus, particularly with smaller models. To
address this, we propose a lightweight method that enhances topical relevance
by directly reweighting the logits of topic-relevant tokens during generation.
We evaluate three such reweighting techniques: Constant Shift, which adds a
constant value to logits; Factor Scaling, which multiplies them by a factor;
and Threshold Selection, which selectively boosts logits that exceed a
probability threshold. Experiments on the NEWTS topical summarization dataset,
using both Gemma-2B and Llama-3-8B models, show that these techniques
effectively increase the use of topic-relevant vocabulary. Notably, the
Threshold Selection method successfully improves topical focus without
compromising summary quality-a trade-off often seen in other approaches. Our
findings demonstrate that directly reweighting logits is a practical and
resource-efficient alternative to fine-tuning, offering a promising pathway for
precisely controlling the thematic content of generated text.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于深度学习的GWAS方法，通过精心设计的架构避免数据泄漏，并在多疾病联合建模中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GWAS方法难以捕捉非线性遗传互作，现有深度学习方法依赖特征选择策略，可能导致数据泄漏或局限于已知通路。

Method: 探索了不同的深度学习架构，并扩展为多标签框架，联合建模五种疾病，利用共享遗传结构提高效率。

Result: 在37,000个样本和五百万个SNP上，方法表现出色（AUC 0.68-0.96），且无数据泄漏。

Conclusion: 该方法为多疾病GWAS分析提供了可扩展、无泄漏且具有生物学意义的解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional GWAS has advanced our understanding of complex diseases but often
misses nonlinear genetic interactions. Deep learning offers new opportunities
to capture complex genomic patterns, yet existing methods mostly depend on
feature selection strategies that either constrain analysis to known pathways
or risk data leakage when applied across the full dataset. Further, covariates
can inflate predictive performance without reflecting true genetic signals. We
explore different deep learning architecture choices for GWAS and demonstrate
that careful architectural choices can outperform existing methods under strict
no-leakage conditions. Building on this, we extend our approach to a
multi-label framework that jointly models five diseases, leveraging shared
genetic architecture for improved efficiency and discovery. Applied to five
million SNPs across 37,000 samples, our method achieves competitive predictive
performance (AUC 0.68-0.96), offering a scalable, leakage-free, and
biologically meaningful approach for multi-disease GWAS analysis.

TL;DR: 论文研究了基于大型语言模型的多智能体系统（LLM-MAS）中的意图隐藏威胁，设计了四种攻击范式，并提出了一种心理学检测框架AgentXposed。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM-MAS在协作问题解决中表现出色，但其通信和协调中的安全风险尚未充分研究。

Method: 系统研究意图隐藏威胁，设计四种攻击范式，并提出结合HEXACO人格模型和Reid技术的检测框架AgentXposed。

Result: 攻击在多种通信结构中表现出强破坏性，AgentXposed能有效检测所有恶意行为。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了意图隐藏攻击的风险，为LLM-MAS安全提供了心理学视角的见解。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems powered by Large Language Models (LLM-MAS) demonstrate
remarkable capabilities in collaborative problem-solving. While LLM-MAS exhibit
strong collaborative abilities, the security risks in their communication and
coordination remain underexplored. We bridge this gap by systematically
investigating intention-hiding threats in LLM-MAS, and design four
representative attack paradigms that subtly disrupt task completion while
maintaining high concealment. These attacks are evaluated in centralized,
decentralized, and layered communication structures. Experiments conducted on
six benchmark datasets, including MMLU, MMLU-Pro, HumanEval, GSM8K, arithmetic,
and biographies, demonstrate that they exhibit strong disruptive capabilities.
To identify these threats, we propose a psychology-based detection framework
AgentXposed, which combines the HEXACO personality model with the Reid
Technique, using progressive questionnaire inquiries and behavior-based
monitoring. Experiments conducted on six types of attacks show that our
detection framework effectively identifies all types of malicious behaviors.
The detection rate for our intention-hiding attacks is slightly lower than that
of the two baselines, Incorrect Fact Injection and Dark Traits Injection,
demonstrating the effectiveness of intention concealment. Our findings reveal
the structural and behavioral risks posed by intention-hiding attacks and offer
valuable insights into securing LLM-based multi-agent systems through
psychological perspectives, which contributes to a deeper understanding of
multi-agent safety. The code and data are available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于动态网络推断的方法，通过时滞相关性分析运动学变量（速度、加速度、方向）来识别领导-跟随关系，优于传统的信息论方法（如转移熵和时滞互信息）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解集体行为中的领导动态是动物生态学、群体机器人和智能交通等领域的关键挑战。传统方法在噪声或短时数据集中表现不佳。

Method: 利用时滞相关性构建动态有向影响图，分析速度、加速度和方向等运动学变量，无需大量数据或参数敏感的离散化。

Result: 在多智能体仿真中验证，网络方法在有限时空观测下优于传统方法，能更一致地将真实领导者排在影响力指标前列。

Conclusion: 动态网络推断方法在识别领导模式方面更高效，适用于数据有限或噪声环境。

Abstract: Understanding leadership dynamics in collective behavior is a key challenge
in animal ecology, swarm robotics, and intelligent transportation. Traditional
information-theoretic approaches, including Transfer Entropy (TE) and
Time-Lagged Mutual Information (TLMI), have been widely used to infer
leader-follower relationships but face critical limitations in noisy or
short-duration datasets due to their reliance on robust probability
estimations. This study proposes a method based on dynamic network inference
using time-lagged correlations across multiple kinematic variables: velocity,
acceleration, and direction. Our approach constructs directed influence graphs
over time, enabling the identification of leadership patterns without the need
for large volumes of data or parameter-sensitive discretization. We validate
our method through two multi-agent simulations in NetLogo: a modified Vicsek
model with informed leaders and a predator-prey model featuring coordinated and
independent wolf groups. Experimental results demonstrate that the
network-based method outperforms TE and TLMI in scenarios with limited
spatiotemporal observations, ranking true leaders at the top of influence
metrics more consistently than TE and TLMI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然灾害频发，机场在救援中成为瓶颈，信息不对称和资源不足是主要问题。

Method: 创建基于代理的模型，模拟不同信息不确定程度下的资源分配策略，并进行专家校准。

Result: 未计划飞机的单个影响可忽略，但多架未计划飞机会显著增加等待时间。

Conclusion: 信息完整性和资源分配策略对机场救援操作性能至关重要。

Abstract: The severity of natural disasters is increasing every year, impacting many
people's lives. During the response phase of disasters, airports are important
hubs where relief aid arrives and people need to be evacuated. However, the
airport often forms a bottleneck in these relief operations due to the sudden
need for increased capacity. Limited research has been done on the operational
side of airport disaster management. Experts identify the main problems as,
first, the asymmetry of information between the airport and incoming flights,
and second, the lack of resources. The goal of this research is to understand
the effects of incomplete knowledge of incoming flights with different resource
allocation strategies on the performance of cargo handling operations at an
airport after a natural disaster. An agent-based model is created, implementing
realistic offloading strategies with different degrees of information
uncertainty. Model calibration and verification are performed with experts in
the field. The model performance is measured by the average turnaround time,
which is divided into offloading time, boarding time, and cumulative waiting
times. The results show that the effects of one unplanned aircraft are
negligible. However, all waiting times increase with more arriving unplanned
aircraft.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试无法充分评估多智能体系统在复杂、动态、真实任务中的可扩展性、鲁棒性和协调能力。

Method: 基于CREW模拟平台，设计了包含大规模地图、异构智能体、部分可观测性和随机动态的野火响应场景，支持低级控制和高级自然语言交互。

Conclusion: CREW-Wildfire为推进可扩展多智能体智能研究提供了关键基础，并支持未来研究。

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent
systems, current benchmarks fall short in evaluating their scalability,
robustness, and coordination capabilities in complex, dynamic, real-world
tasks. Existing environments typically focus on small-scale, fully observable,
or low-complexity domains, limiting their utility for developing and assessing
next-generation multi-agent Agentic AI frameworks. We introduce CREW-Wildfire,
an open-source benchmark designed to close this gap. Built atop the human-AI
teaming CREW simulation platform, CREW-Wildfire offers procedurally generated
wildfire response scenarios featuring large maps, heterogeneous agents, partial
observability, stochastic dynamics, and long-horizon planning objectives. The
environment supports both low-level control and high-level natural language
interactions through modular Perception and Execution modules. We implement and
evaluate several state-of-the-art LLM-based multi-agent Agentic AI frameworks,
uncovering significant performance gaps that highlight the unsolved challenges
in large-scale coordination, communication, spatial reasoning, and long-horizon
planning under uncertainty. By providing more realistic complexity, scalable
architecture, and behavioral evaluation metrics, CREW-Wildfire establishes a
critical foundation for advancing research in scalable multi-agent Agentic
intelligence. All code, environments, data, and baselines will be released to
support future research in this emerging domain.

Conclusion: 提出的sc-iLTL和MCTS方法能够有效处理复杂感知任务的最优策略合成问题。

Abstract: Perception-related tasks often arise in autonomous systems operating under
partial observability. This work studies the problem of synthesizing optimal
policies for complex perception-related objectives in environments modeled by
partially observable Markov decision processes. To formally specify such
objectives, we introduce \emph{co-safe linear inequality temporal logic}
(sc-iLTL), which can define complex tasks that are formed by the logical
concatenation of atomic propositions as linear inequalities on the belief space
of the POMDPs. Our solution to the control synthesis problem is to transform
the \mbox{sc-iLTL} objectives into reachability objectives by constructing the
product of the belief MDP and a deterministic finite automaton built from the
sc-iLTL objective. To overcome the scalability challenge due to the product, we
introduce a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) method that converges in probability
to the optimal policy. Finally, a drone-probing case study demonstrates the
applicability of our method.

Result: 显著减少了总速度增量，有效解决了数万颗卫星的星座检查轨迹优化问题。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模星座的可持续管理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of mega-constellations in low Earth orbits has posed
significant challenges to space traffic management, necessitating periodic
inspections of satellites to ensure the sustainability of the space environment
when economically feasible. This study addresses the orbital design challenge
associated with inspecting numerous satellites distributed across multiple
orbital planes through flybys by proposing an innovative orbital-plane-based
inspection strategy. The proposed methodology reformulates the multi-satellite
flyby problem into a multi-rendezvous trajectory planning problem by proposing
an analytical approach to determine a maneuver-free inspection orbit that
enables flyby of all satellites within a specific orbital plane. Additionally,
a three-layer global optimization framework is developed to tackle this
problem. The first layer establishes an approximate cost evaluation model for
orbital plane visitation sequences, utilizing a genetic algorithm to identify
the optimal sequence from a vast array of candidate planes, thereby maximizing
inspection targets while minimizing fuel consumption. The second layer
constructs a mixed-integer programming model to locally refine the rendezvous
epochs and orbital parameters of each inspection orbit to reduce the total
velocity increment. The third layer accurately computes the optimal impulsive
maneuvers and trajectories between inspection orbits. In contrast to
traditional low-Earth orbit rendezvous optimization frameworks, the proposed
framework fully leverages the adjustable freedom in inclination and right
ascension of the ascending node (RAAN) of inspection orbits, significantly
reducing the total velocity increment. Simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed method can effectively address the trajectory optimization problem
associated with constellation inspection for tens of thousands of satellites.

Motivation: 在噪声环境下，过小的时间常数会损害名义性能恢复，因此需要确定合适的时间常数以保证性能。

Method: 使用基于奇异摄动理论的Lyapunov方法，分析时间常数对性能的影响。

Result: 提出了一个可接受的噪声水平和时间常数的开区间，以保证瞬态和稳态性能。

Conclusion: 分析表明，只有在无噪声情况下，过小的时间常数才能确保目标性能。

Abstract: Q-filter-based disturbance observer (DOB) is one of the most widely used
robust controller due to its design simplicity. Such simplicity arises from
that reducing the time constant of low pass filters, not only ensures robust
stability but also enhances nominal performance recovery -- ability to recover
the trajectory of nominal closed-loop system. However, in contrast to
noise-free environment, excessively small time constant can rather damage the
nominal performance recovery under measurement noise. That is, minimizing time
constant is no longer immediately guaranteeing nominal performance recovery.
Motivated by this observation, this paper concentrates on determination of time
constant to ensure transient and steady state performance. This analysis uses
Lyapunov method based on the coordinate change inspired by the singular
perturbation theory. As a result, we present an affordable noise level and open
interval for the time constant that guarantees both the required performances.
The analysis can also lead to theoretical demonstration on that excessively
reducing time constant is assured to achieve target performance only for
noise-free case.

Result: 模型能更准确地反映驾驶员的有限理性和决策倾向，比NE模型更现实高效。

Abstract: Modeling the decision-making behavior of vehicles presents unique challenges,
particularly during unprotected left turns at intersections, where the
uncertainty of human drivers is especially pronounced. In this context,
connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) technology emerges as a promising avenue for
effectively managing such interactions while ensuring safety and efficiency.
Traditional approaches, often grounded in game theory assumptions of perfect
rationality, may inadequately capture the complexities of real-world scenarios
and drivers' decision-making errors. To fill this gap, we propose a novel
decision-making model for vehicle unprotected left-turn scenarios, integrating
game theory with considerations for drivers' bounded rationality. Our model,
formulated as a two-player normal-form game solved by a quantal response
equilibrium (QRE), offers a more nuanced depiction of driver decision-making
processes compared to Nash equilibrium (NE) models. Leveraging an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm coupled with a subtle neural network
trained on precise microscopic vehicle trajectory data, we optimize model
parameters to accurately reflect drivers' interaction-aware bounded rationality
and driving styles. Through comprehensive simulation experiments, we
demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed model in capturing the
interaction-aware bounded rationality and decision tendencies between players.
The proposed model proves to be more realistic and efficient than NE models in
unprotected left-turn scenarios. Our findings contribute valuable insights into
the vehicle decision-making behaviors with bounded rationality, thereby
informing the development of more robust and realistic autonomous driving
systems.

Abstract: Recent years have seen rapid increases in intermittent renewable generation,
requiring novel battery energy storage systems (BESS) solutions. One recent
trend is the emergence of large grid-connected batteries, that can be
controlled to provide multiple storage and flexibility services, using a
stacked revenue model. Another emerging development is renewable energy
communities (REC), in which prosumers invest in their own renewable generation
capacity, but also requiring battery storage for flexibility. In this paper, we
study settings in which energy communities rent battery capacity from a battery
operator through a battery-as-a-service (BaaS) model. We present a methodology
for determining the sizing and pricing of battery capacity that can be rented,
such that it provides economic benefits to both the community and the battery
operator that participates in the energy market. We examine how sizes and
prices vary across a number of different scenarios for different types of
tariffs (flat, dynamic) and competing energy market uses. Second, we conduct a
systematic study of linear optimization models for battery control when
deployed to provide flexibility to energy communities. We show that existing
approaches for battery control with daily time windows have a number of
important limitations in practical deployments, and we propose a number of
regularization functions in the optimization to address them. Finally, we
investigate the proposed method using real generation, demand, tariffs, and
battery data, based on a practical case study from a large battery operator in
the Netherlands. For the settings in our case study, we find that a community
of 200 houses with a 330 kW wind turbine can save up to 12,874 euros per year
by renting just 280 kWh of battery capacity (after subtracting battery rental
costs), with the methodology applicable to a wide variety of settings and
tariff types.

Abstract: The paper presents a novel approach to synthesize robust controllers for
nonlinear systems along perturbed trajectories. The approach linearizes the
system with respect to a reference trajectory. In contrast to existing methods
rooted in robust linear time-varying synthesis, the approach accurately
includes perturbations that drive the system away from the reference
trajectory. Hence, the controller obtained in the linear framework provides a
significantly more robust nonlinear performance. The calculation of the
controller is derived from robust synthesis approaches rooted in the integral
quadratic constraints framework. The feasibility of the approach is
demonstrated on a pitch tracker design for a space launcher.

Abstract: Advancing the dynamics inference of power electronic systems (PES) to the

which transforms sequential bottlenecks into highly parallel operation suitable
for edge hardware. Experimental vali-dation on a multi-stage DC-DC converter
demonstrates that NSS achieves 23x speedup and 60% hardware resource reduction
compared to traditional solvers, paving the way for deploying edge inference of

Abstract: The rapid growth of distributed energy resources (DERs), including rooftop
solar and energy storage, is transforming the grid edge, where distributed
technologies and customer-side systems increasingly interact with the broader
power grid. DER aggregators, entities that coordinate and optimize the actions
of many small-scale DERs, play a key role in this transformation. This paper
presents a hybrid Mean-Field Control (MFC) and Mean-Field Game (MFG) framework
for integrating DER aggregators into wholesale electricity markets. Unlike
traditional approaches that treat market prices as exogenous, our model
captures the feedback between aggregators' strategies and locational marginal
prices (LMPs) of electricity. The MFC component optimizes DER operations within
each aggregator, while the MFG models strategic interactions among multiple
aggregators. To account for various uncertainties, we incorporate reinforcement
learning (RL), which allows aggregators to learn optimal bidding strategies in
dynamic market conditions. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a
mean-field equilibrium and validate the framework through a case study of the
Oahu Island power system. Results show that our approach reduces price
volatility and improves market efficiency, offering a scalable and
decentralized solution for DER integration in wholesale markets.

Abstract: Component Modal Synthesis (CMS) is a reduced order modelling method widely
used for large-scale complex systems. It can effectively approximate
system-level models through component synthesis, in which the repetitive
geometrical components are modelled once and synthesised together. However, the
conventional CMS only applies to systems with stationary components connected
by strictly compatible ports, limiting it from modelling systems with moving
components. This paper presents an adaptive port (AP) technique to extend CMS
approaches for modelling parametric systems with rotational parts. To
demonstrate the capability of the AP technique, we apply it to the Static
Condensation Reduced Basis Element (SCRBE), one widely used variant of CMS
approaches. The AP-based SCRBE (AP-SCRBE) can enforce the synthesis of
rotational-stationary components over a shared adaptive port when the
connecting surfaces of two components are discretisation-wise incompatible,
which happens when one component moves relative to the others. Numerical
experiments on the NREL 5MW wind turbine show that, in the context of
rotational-stationary component synthesis, the AP-SCRBE can accurately and
efficiently model the rotating rotor with pitch rotation of blades. It can
produce almost identical results to a high-fidelity finite element model at two
to three orders faster speeds.

Abstract: This work introduces a novel analytical model for estimating the airspeed of
fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) using solely propeller power and
rotational speed measurements. The model can be used to replace
Pitot-tube-based airspeed sensors, or contribute to redundancy in airspeed
estimation. It does not require knowledge of the vehicle's dynamic model and is
computationally lightweight. It leverages power and rotational speed feedback,
which is readily available from modern Electronic Speed Controllers (ESCs),
thereby enabling seamless integration with existing systems and off-the-shelf
components. A systematic approach is followed to derive the model structure
based on least squares optimization and regularization techniques on Blade
Element Momentum (BEM) simulation, wind tunnel, and flight test datasets. The
final model generalizes well achieving a normalized Root Mean Square Error
(nRMSE) of 5% on unseen flight data. The model parameters can be identified
either offline, using flight logs with airspeed measurements, or in-flight,
using a lightweight identification method based only on Global Positioning
System (GPS) velocity data. The resulting system provides a robust and
computationally efficient solution for real-time airspeed estimation across
diverse fixed-wing UAV platforms.

Abstract: The transition to electric transportation demands efficient and
cost-effective powertrains. Optimizing energy use is crucial for extending
range and reducing expenses. However, comparing inverter and motor efficiency
based on inverter topologies is challenging due to biased methodologies that
favor certain designs over others. This document introduces a novel

minimizing chip area of single and dual traction inverters, indicating
potential energy savings and cost reduction. Recent publications of both
industry and academia underscore the importance of these design goals achieved
by either novel inverter topologies or enhanced control methods. Two promising
topologies with the inherent capability of partial load optimization are
evaluated regarding chip area and system efficiency to find the most suitable
concept for future electric vehicle power trains.

Abstract: The continuously increasing renewable energy sources (RES) and demand
response (DR) are becoming important sources of system flexibility. As a
consequence, decision-dependent uncertainties (DDUs), interchangeably referred
to as endogenous uncertainties, impose new characteristics to power system
dispatch. The DDUs faced by system operators originate from uncertain
dispatchable resources such as RES units or DR, while reserve providers
encounter DDUs arising from the uncertain reserve deployment. This paper
presents a systematic framework for addressing robust dispatch problems with
DDUs. The main contributions include i) the robust characterization of DDUs
with a dependency decomposition structure; ii) a generic DDU coping mechanism,
manifested as the bilateral matching between uncertainty and flexibility; iii)
analyses of the influence of DDU incorporation on the convexity/non-convexity
of robust dispatch problems; and iv) generic solution algorithms adaptive for
DDUs. Under this framework, the inherent distinctions and correlations between
DDUs and DIUs are revealed, providing a fundamental theoretical basis for the
economic and reliable operation of RES-dominated power systems. Applications in
the source and demand sides illustrate the importance of considering DDUs and
verify the effectiveness of proposed algorithms for robust dispatch with DDUs.

Abstract: The emerging field of neuromorphic computing for edge control applications
poses the need to quantitatively estimate and limit the number of spiking
neurons, to reduce network complexity and optimize the number of neurons per
core and hence, the chip size, in an application-specific neuromorphic
hardware. While rate-encoding for spiking neurons provides a robust way to
encode signals with the same number of neurons as an ANN, it often lacks
precision. To achieve the desired accuracy, a population of neurons is often
needed to encode the complete range of input signals. However, using population
encoding immensely increases the total number of neurons required for a
particular application, thus increasing the power consumption and on-board
resource utilization. A transition from two neurons to a population of neurons
for the LQR control of a cartpole is shown in this work. The near-linear
behavior of a Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire neuron can be exploited to achieve the
Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) control of a cartpole system. This has been
shown in simulation, followed by a demonstration on a single-neuron hardware,
known as Lu.i. The improvement in control performance is then demonstrated by
using a population of varying numbers of neurons for similar control in the
Nengo Neural Engineering Framework, on CPU and on Intel's Loihi neuromorphic
chip. Finally, linear control is demonstrated for four multi-linked pendula on
cart systems, using a population of neurons in Nengo, followed by an
implementation of the same on Loihi. This study compares LQR control in the NEF
using $7$ control and $7$ neuromorphic performance metrics, followed by a
comparison with other conventional spiking and non-spiking controllers.

Conclusion: 本文补充了现有研究，为鲁棒控制的可行性提供了新的理论支持。

Abstract: This paper addresses a fundamental and important question in control: under
what conditions does there fail to exist a robust control policy that keeps the
state of a constrained linear system within a target set, despite bounded
disturbances? This question has practical implications for actuator and sensor
specification, feasibility analysis for reference tracking, and the design of
adversarial attacks in cyber-physical systems. While prior research has
predominantly focused on using optimization to compute control-invariant sets
to ensure feasible operation, our work complements these approaches by
characterizing explicit sufficient conditions under which robust control is
fundamentally infeasible. Specifically, we derive novel closed-form, algebraic
expressions that relate the size of a disturbance set -- modelled as a scaled
version of a basic shape -- to the system's spectral properties and the
geometry of the constraint sets.

Abstract: This paper presents a battery-less, self-powered water leak detection system

system harvests hydroelectric energy through a layered stack of conductive
nanomaterials and metals, achieving a peak short-circuit current of over 500 mA

higher power demands, an energy management subsystem -- comprising a DC-DC
boost converter and a 100 mF supercapacitor -- ensures stable power delivery
for the LLCC68 LoRa module. Experimental results demonstrate the system's
ability to detect leaks as shallow as 0.5 mm, activate within 50 seconds across

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive modeling and control framework for a
low-cost multirotor hybrid aerial-aquatic vehicle (MHAUV) capable of seamless
air-water transitions. A hybrid dynamics model is proposed to account for the
distinct hydrodynamic and aerodynamic forces across three operational zones:
aerial, aquatic, and transitional hybrid regions. The model incorporates
variable buoyancy, added mass effects, and fluid resistance, with thrust
characteristics of submerged propellers analyzed through computational fluid
dynamics (CFD) simulations. A hierarchical control strategy is developed,
combining twisting sliding mode control (TWSMC) for robust attitude
stabilization during medium transitions with cascade PID controllers for
precise motion tracking in homogeneous media. Experimental validation using a
modified FPV quadrotor prototype demonstrates the effectiveness of the
approach, achieving steady-state height errors below 0.1 m and attitude
fluctuations under 5{\deg} during repeated water-crossing maneuvers. The
results highlight the system's adaptability to fluid medium variations while
maintaining cost-effectiveness and operational simplicity.

Abstract: Many biological, technological, and social systems are effectively networks
of interacting individual systems. Typically, these networks are not isolated
objects, but interact with their environment through both signals and
information that is received by specific nodes with an input function or
released to the environment by other nodes with an output function. An
important question is whether the structure of different networks, together
with the particular selection of input and output nodes, is such that it favors
the passing or blocking of such signals. For a given network and a given choice
of the input and output nodes, the H2-norm provides a natural and general
quantification of the extent to which input signals-whether deterministic or
stochastic, periodic or arbitrary-are amplified. We analyze a diverse set of
empirical networks and conjecture that many naturally occurring systems-such as
food webs, signaling pathways, and gene regulatory circuits-are structurally
organized to enhance the passing of signals, facilitating the efficient flow of
biomass, information, or regulatory activity. This passing behavior culminates
in directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), for which we analytically show that
amplification depends on the number and length of input-output pathways, which
is consistent with the well-known tendency of naturally emerging networks to
approximate DAG structures. In contrast, the structure of engineered systems
like power grids appears to be intentionally designed to suppress signal
propagation, as the transmitted quantity-voltage phase differences-requires
tight control to maintain synchronized operation.

Conclusion: 提出的方法为POMDP提供了一种灵活且高效的近似解决方案，并通过偏置聚合进一步优化误差。

Abstract: We consider a finite-state partially observable Markov decision problem
(POMDP) with an infinite horizon and a discounted cost, and we propose a new
method for computing a cost function approximation that is based on features
and aggregation. In particular, using the classical belief-space formulation,
we construct a related Markov decision problem (MDP) by first aggregating the
unobservable states into feature states, and then introducing representative
beliefs over these feature states. This two-stage aggregation approach
facilitates the use of dynamic programming methods for solving the aggregate
problem and provides additional design flexibility. The optimal cost function
of the aggregate problem can in turn be used within an on-line approximation in
value space scheme for the original POMDP. We derive a new bound on the
approximation error of our scheme. In addition, we establish conditions under
which the cost function approximation provides a lower bound for the optimal
cost. Finally, we present a biased aggregation approach, which leverages an
optimal cost function estimate to improve the quality of the approximation
error of the aggregate problem.

Abstract: To address the limitations imposed by Bode's gain-phase relationship in
linear controllers, a reset-based filter called the Constant in gain- Lead in
phase (CgLp) filter has been introduced. This filter consists of a reset
element and a linear lead filter. However, the sequencing of these two
components has been a topic of debate. Positioning the lead filter before the
reset element in the loop leads to noise amplification in the reset signal,
whereas placing the lead filter after the reset element results in the
magnification of higher-order harmonics. This study introduces a tunable lead
CgLp structure in which the lead filter is divided into two segments, enabling
a balance between noise reduction and higher-order harmonics mitigation.
Additionally, a filtering technique is proposed, employing a
target-frequency-based approach to mitigate nonlinearity in reset control
systems in the presence of noise. The effectiveness of the proposed methods in
reducing nonlinearity is demonstrated through both frequency domain and
time-domain analyses using a simulated precision positioning system as a case
study.

Abstract: This paper presents a mixed-integer, nonlinear, multi-objective optimization
strategy for optimal power allocation among parallel strings in Battery Energy
Storage Systems (BESS). High-fidelity control is achieved by co-simulating the
optimizer with a BESS electro-thermal simulation that models spatial thermal
dynamics of the battery, providing real-time State of Charge (SOC) and
temperature feedback. The optimizer prioritizes reliability by enforcing power
availability as a hard constraint and penalizing battery thermal derating.
Within these bounds, the controller performs a Pareto sweep on the relative
weights of inverter and battery losses to balance the trade-off between
inverter efficiency and battery efficiency. The inverter loss model is based on
an empirical lookup table (LUT) derived from a commercial inverter system,
while the battery thermal loss model uses SOC and temperature-dependent
internal resistance, with electric current computed from the battery Equivalent
Circuit Model (ECM). When the optimization was applied to a two-string BESS,
the competing effects of inverter and battery losses on system availability and
thermal derating were observed. The balanced operation yielded improvements of
1% in battery efficiency, 1.5% in inverter efficiency, and 2% in derating
efficiency, while maintaining higher availability. Additionally, a 5 degrees C
reduction in BESS peak temperature also suggests reduced thermal stress without
compromising availability.

Abstract: This paper presents a degradation-cost-aware optimization framework for
multi-string battery energy storage systems, emphasizing the impact of
inhomogeneous subsystem-level aging in operational decision-making. We evaluate
four scenarios for an energy arbitrage scenario, that vary in model precision
and treatment of aging costs. Key performance metrics include operational
revenue, power schedule mismatch, missed revenues, capacity losses, and revenue
generated per unit of capacity loss. Our analysis reveals that ignoring
heterogeneity of subunits may lead to infeasible dispatch plans and reduced
revenues. In contrast, combining accurate representation of degraded subsystems
and the consideration of aging costs in the objective function improves
operational accuracy and economic efficiency of BESS with heterogeneous aged
subunits. The fully informed scenario, which combines aging-cost-aware
optimization with precise string-level modeling, achieves 21% higher revenue
per unit of SOH loss compared to the baseline scenario. These findings
highlight that modeling aging heterogeneity is not just a technical refinement
but may become a crucial enabler for maximizing both short-term profitability
and long-term asset value in particular for long BESS usage scenarios.

Abstract: Acupuncture, one of the key therapeutic methods in Traditional Chinese
Medicine (TCM), has been widely adopted in various clinical fields.
Quantitative research on acupuncture manipulation parameters is critical to
achieve standardized techniques. However, quantitative mechanical detection of
acupuncture parameters remains limited. This study establishes a kinematic and
dynamic model of acupuncture, identifying key parameters such as
lifting-thrusting force, acceleration, velocity, displacement, as well as
twirling-rotating angular velocity and angle. To measure these critical
parameters, we propose a quantitative system comprising a sensing needle
equipped with a force sensor and an inertial measurement unit (IMU), as well as
an external camera module to capture image information. By fusing visual and
IMU data, we accurately identify the stationary or motion states of the needle,
enabling segmented computation of lifting-thrusting velocity and displacement.
The experimental results demonstrate that the sensing needle achieves
comprehensive detection with high precision, featuring a nonlinearity error of
0.45% in force measurement and an RMSE of 1.2 mm in displacement. The extracted
parameters provide an objective description of the operational characteristics
and motion patterns of the four basic acupuncture manipulations. These findings
provide valuable tools and methods for research in acupuncture standardization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在运行规划中考虑最优UFLS，避免其增加，从而通过放宽备用需求约束降低系统运行成本。

Method: 使用Tobit模型估计初始频率变化率的最优UFLS量，并分析不同日需求曲线和成本敏感性。

Result: 在西班牙孤岛电力系统中验证了该方法能降低运行成本，同时保持频率响应质量。

Conclusion: 校正FCUC方法有效平衡了成本与频率响应质量，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel corrective \gls{fcuc} formulation for island
power systems by implementing data-driven constraint learning to estimate the
optimal \gls{ufls}. The Tobit model is presented to estimate the optimal amount
of \gls{ufls} using the initial rate of change of frequency. The proposed
formulation enables co-optimizing operation costs and \gls{ufls}. The aim is to
account for optimal \gls{ufls} occurrences during operation planning, without
increasing them. This would potentially reduce system operation costs by
relaxing the reserve requirement constraint. The performance of the proposed
formulation has been analyzed for a Spanish island power system through various
simulations. Different daily demand profiles are analyzed to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed formulation. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis
is conducted to demonstrate the effects of changing the cost associated with
\gls{ufls}. The corrective \gls{fcuc} is shown to be capable of reducing system
operation costs without jeopardizing the quality of the frequency response in
terms of \gls{ufls} occurrence.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可再生能源渗透增加导致系统惯量和频率控制能力下降，影响频率稳定性，尤其在低惯量电力系统中更为显著。

Method: 通过比较不同FCUC公式，提出两种评估指标（系统效益和计算负担），并在西班牙某岛屿电力系统进行仿真。

Result: 数据驱动的修正FCUC公式在系统效益和计算效率上表现最优。

Conclusion: 数据驱动的修正FCUC公式是低惯量电力系统中频率控制的有效解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources reduces rotating
inertia and even frequency control capacity, affecting frequency stability.
This challenge is significant in \gls{ips} that already suffer from low inertia
and frequency control capacity. This paper presents a comparative study on
different \gls{fcuc} formulations applied to \gls{ips}. Then, by considering
under-frequency load shedding as a significant measure of frequency stability
in \gls{ips}, two indices are presented to fully compare the formulations from
system benefits and computational burden perspectives. Simulations conducted on
a real Spanish island show that the data-driven corrective \gls{fcuc}
formulation has the most advantages among other formulations.
