At the core of the proposed machine is an\nasynchronous autoencoder architecture that captures higher-order interactions\nby directly manipulating Ising clauses instead of Ising spins, thereby\nmaintaining resource complexity independent of interaction order. Asymptotic\nconvergence to the Ising ground state is ensured by sampling the autoencoder\nlatent space defined by the spins, based on the annealing dynamics of the\nFowler-Nordheim quantum mechanical tunneling. To demonstrate the advantages of\nthe proposed higher-order neuromorphic Ising machine, we systematically solved\nbenchmark combinatorial optimization problems such as MAX-CUT and MAX-SAT,\ncomparing the results to those obtained using a second-order Ising machine\nemploying the same annealing process. Our findings indicate that the proposed\narchitecture consistently provides higher quality solutions in shorter time\nframes compared to the second-order model across multiple runs. Additionally,\nwe show that the techniques based on the sparsity of the interconnection\nmatrix, such as graph coloring, can be effectively applied to higher-order\nneuromorphic Ising machines, enhancing the solution quality and the\ntime-to-solution. The time-to-solution can be further improved through hardware\nco-design, as demonstrated in this paper using a field-programmable gate array\n(FPGA).

Spray\nbooms' width of 38m, combined with 30 kph driving speeds, varying terrain, and\nmachine dynamics when maneuvering complex field boundaries, make controls of\nthese booms very complex. However, there is no quantitative knowledge on the\nextent of boom movement to systematically develop a solution that might include\nboom designs and responsive boom control systems. Therefore, this study was\nconducted to develop an automated computer vision system to quantify the boom\nmovement of various agricultural sprayers. A computer vision system was\ndeveloped to track a target on the edge of the sprayer boom in real time. YOLO\nV7, V8, and V11 neural network models were trained to track the boom's\nmovements in field operations to quantify effective displacement in the\nvertical and transverse directions. An inclinometer sensor was mounted on the\nboom to capture boom angles and validate the neural network model output.

The DIPCA-based method\nworks efficiently for dynamical systems devoid of any algebraic relations.\nHowever, several dynamical systems operate under feedback control and/or are\ncoupled with conservation laws, leading to differential-algebraic (DAE) or\nmixed causal systems. In this work, a method, namely the partition of variables\n(PoV), for causal discovery in LTI-DAE systems is proposed. This method is\nsuperior to the method that was presented by Kathari and Tangirala (2022), as\nPoV also works for pure dynamical systems, which are devoid of algebraic\nequations. The proposed method identifies the causal drivers up to a minimal\nsubset. PoV deploys DIPCA to first determine the number of algebraic relations\n($n_a$), the number of dynamical relations ($n_d$) and the constraint matrix.\nSubsequently, the subsets are identified through an admissible partitioning of\nthe constraint matrix by finding the condition number of it. Case studies are\npresented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."}

A key challenge in comparing AR and MDM paradigms is their\ntypical architectural difference: AR models are often decoder-only, while MDMs\nhave largely been encoder-only. This practice of changing both the modeling\nparadigm and architecture simultaneously makes direct comparisons unfair, as\nit's hard to distinguish whether observed differences stem from the paradigm\nitself or the architectural shift.

This\ndenoising process can be interpreted as a form of hill climbing in a learned\nlatent space, where the model iteratively refines the sample toward regions of\nhigher probability. However, diffusion models often converge to local optima\nthat are locally visually coherent yet globally inconsistent or conditionally\nmisaligned, due to latent space complexity and suboptimal initialization. Prior\nefforts attempted to address this by strengthening guidance signals or\nmanipulating the initial noise distribution. We introduce Controlled Random\nZigzag Sampling (Ctrl-Z Sampling), a novel sampling strategy designed to detect\nand escape such local maxima during conditional generation. The method first\nidentifies potential local maxima using a reward model. Upon detection, it\ninjects noise and reverts to a previous, noisier state to escape the current\noptimization plateau. The reward model then evaluates candidate trajectories,\naccepting only those that offer improvement, while progressively deeper retreat\nenables stronger escapes when nearby alternatives fail. This controlled random\nzigzag process allows dynamic alternation between forward refinement and\nbackward exploration, enhancing both alignment and visual quality in the\ngenerated outputs. The proposed Ctrl-Z Sampling is model-agnostic and\ncompatible with existing diffusion frameworks. Experimental results show that\nCtrl-Z Sampling substantially improves generation quality with only around 7.6X\nincrease in function evaluations."}

The Supporter assists the Seeker\nby transmitting a compressed representation of its local map under bandwidth\nconstraints to support the Seeker's path-planning task. We introduce a bit-rate\nmetric based on the expected binary codeword length to quantify communication\ncost. Using this metric, we formulate the compression design problem as a\nrate-distortion optimization problem that determines when to communicate, which\nregions of the map should be included in the compressed representation, and at\nwhat resolution (i.e., quantization level) they should be encoded. Our\nformulation allows different map regions to be encoded at varying quantization\nlevels based on their relevance to the Seeker's path-planning task. We\ndemonstrate that the resulting optimization problem is convex, and admits a\nclosed-form solution known in the information theory literature as reverse\nwater-filling, enabling efficient, low-computation, and real-time\nimplementation. Additionally, we show that the Seeker can infer the compression\ndecisions of the Supporter independently, requiring only the encoded map\ncontent and not the encoding policy itself to be transmitted, thereby reducing\ncommunication overhead.

This study presents the first learning-based Quick\nResponse (QR) code decoding and investigates learning functions of medium\nsensitivity. Our experiments reveal that Transformers can successfully decode\nQR codes, even beyond the theoretical error-correction limit, by learning the\nstructure of embedded texts. They generalize from English-rich training data to\nother languages and even random strings. Moreover, we observe that the\nTransformer-based QR decoder focuses on data bits while ignoring\nerror-correction bits, suggesting a decoding mechanism distinct from standard\nQR code readers."}

Existing forgery detection methods typically rely on single visual\nfeatures to capture predefined artifacts, such as spatial-domain cues to detect\nforged objects like roads or buildings in RSI, or frequency-domain features to\nidentify artifacts from up-sampling operations in adversarial generative\nnetworks (GANs). However, the nature of artifacts can significantly differ\ndepending on geographic terrain, land cover types, or specific features within\nthe RSI. Moreover, these complex artifacts evolve as generative models become\nmore sophisticated. In short, over-reliance on a single visual cue makes\nexisting forgery detectors struggle to generalize across diverse remote sensing\ndata. This paper proposed a novel forgery detection framework called SFNet,\ndesigned to identify fake images in diverse remote sensing data by leveraging\nspatial and frequency domain features. Specifically, to obtain rich and\ncomprehensive visual information, SFNet employs two independent feature\nextractors to capture spatial and frequency domain features from input RSIs.

In this paper, we introduce HiWave, a training-free,\nzero-shot approach that substantially enhances visual fidelity and structural\ncoherence in ultra-high-resolution image synthesis using pretrained diffusion\nmodels. Our method employs a two-stage pipeline: generating a base image from\nthe pretrained model followed by a patch-wise DDIM inversion step and a novel\nwavelet-based detail enhancer module. Specifically, we first utilize inversion\nmethods to derive initial noise vectors that preserve global coherence from the\nbase image. Subsequently, during sampling, our wavelet-domain detail enhancer\nretains low-frequency components from the base image to ensure structural\nconsistency, while selectively guiding high-frequency components to enrich fine\ndetails and textures. Extensive evaluations using Stable Diffusion XL\ndemonstrate that HiWave effectively mitigates common visual artifacts seen in\nprior methods, achieving superior perceptual quality. A user study confirmed\nHiWave's performance, where it was preferred over the state-of-the-art\nalternative in more than 80% of comparisons, highlighting its effectiveness for\nhigh-quality, ultra-high-resolution image synthesis without requiring\nretraining or architectural modifications."}

These images\nare widely shared across Online Social Networks (OSNs), raising concerns about\ntheir misuse. Existing deepfake detection methods overlook the ``block effects\"\nintroduced by compression in OSNs, which obscure deepfake artifacts, and\nprimarily focus on raw images, rarely encountered in real-world scenarios. To\naddress these challenges, we propose PLADA (Pay Less Attention to Deceptive\nArtifacts), a novel framework designed to tackle the lack of paired data and\nthe ineffective use of compressed images. PLADA consists of two core modules:\nBlock Effect Eraser (B2E), which uses a dual-stage attention mechanism to\nhandle block effects, and Open Data Aggregation (ODA), which processes both\npaired and unpaired data to improve detection. Extensive experiments across 26\ndatasets demonstrate that PLADA achieves a remarkable balance in deepfake\ndetection, outperforming SoTA methods in detecting deepfakes on OSNs, even with\nlimited paired data and compression. More importantly, this work introduces the\n``block effect\" as a critical factor in deepfake detection, providing a robust\nsolution for open-world scenarios.

Under Review", "summary": "We propose DemoDiffusion, a simple and scalable method for enabling robots to\nperform manipulation tasks in natural environments by imitating a single human\ndemonstration. Our approach is based on two key insights. First, the hand\nmotion in a human demonstration provides a useful prior for the robot's\nend-effector trajectory, which we can convert into a rough open-loop robot\nmotion trajectory via kinematic retargeting. Second, while this retargeted\nmotion captures the overall structure of the task, it may not align well with\nplausible robot actions in-context. To address this, we leverage a pre-trained\ngeneralist diffusion policy to modify the trajectory, ensuring it both follows\nthe human motion and remains within the distribution of plausible robot\nactions. Our approach avoids the need for online reinforcement learning or\npaired human-robot data, enabling robust adaptation to new tasks and scenes\nwith minimal manual effort. Experiments in both simulation and real-world\nsettings show that DemoDiffusion outperforms both the base policy and the\nretargeted trajectory, enabling the robot to succeed even on tasks where the\npre-trained generalist policy fails entirely.
