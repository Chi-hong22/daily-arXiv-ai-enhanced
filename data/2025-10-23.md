TL;DR: 本文综述了维度降维技术在遥感数据价值链条中的应用，为处理高维地球观测数据提供手册指南


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地球观测数据量日益增长，高维数据面临稀疏性、效率低下和维度灾难等问题，限制了机器学习模型的有效性，需要维度降维技术来解决这些挑战

Method: 通过特征提取等维度降维技术，在降低数据复杂度的同时保留关键数据特性，支持数据压缩、清洗、融合、可视化、异常检测和预测等任务

Result: 为遥感数据价值链条中的维度降维应用提供了系统指导，识别了未充分探索的DR算法及其在未来研究中的应用机会

Conclusion: 维度降维技术对处理高维地球观测数据至关重要，本综述为相关研究和应用提供了实用手册，并指出了未来研究方向

Abstract: Earth observation involves collecting, analyzing, and processing an
ever-growing mass of data. Automatically harvesting information is crucial for
addressing significant societal, economic, and environmental challenges,
ranging from environmental monitoring to urban planning and disaster
management. However, the high dimensionality of these data poses challenges in
terms of sparsity, inefficiency, and the curse of dimensionality, which limits
the effectiveness of machine learning models. Dimensionality reduction (DR)
techniques, specifically feature extraction, address these challenges by
preserving essential data properties while reducing complexity and enhancing
tasks such as data compression, cleaning, fusion, visualization, anomaly
detection, and prediction. This review provides a handbook for leveraging DR
across the RS data value chain and identifies opportunities for under-explored
DR algorithms and their application in future research.

### [2] [Ninja Codes: Neurally Generated Fiducial Markers for Stealthy 6-DoF Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18976)
*Yuichiro Takeuchi,Yusuke Imoto,Shunya Kato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ninja Codes是一种神经生成的基准标记，能够自然地融入现实环境，通过视觉上的微小修改将任意图像转换为隐蔽的标记，用于6自由度位置跟踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基准标记在视觉上过于显眼，影响美观，不适用于对美观有要求的场景。

Method: 使用端到端的深度隐写方法，联合训练编码网络和检测网络模块，将任意图像转换为隐蔽的Ninja Codes。

Result: 实验表明Ninja Codes在常见室内光照条件下能提供可靠的位置跟踪，同时成功隐藏在多样环境纹理中。

Conclusion: Ninja Codes在传统基准标记因外观显眼而不适用的场景中具有特殊价值，可用于增强现实、机器人技术等应用。

Abstract: In this paper we describe Ninja Codes, neurally-generated fiducial markers
that can be made to naturally blend into various real-world environments. An
encoder network converts arbitrary images into Ninja Codes by applying visually
modest alterations; the resulting codes, printed and pasted onto surfaces, can
provide stealthy 6-DoF location tracking for a wide range of applications
including augmented reality, robotics, motion-based user interfaces, etc. Ninja
Codes can be printed using off-the-shelf color printers on regular printing
paper, and can be detected using any device equipped with a modern RGB camera
and capable of running inference. Using an end-to-end process inspired by prior
work on deep steganography, we jointly train a series of network modules that
perform the creation and detection of Ninja Codes. Through experiments, we
demonstrate Ninja Codes' ability to provide reliable location tracking under
common indoor lighting conditions, while successfully concealing themselves
within diverse environmental textures. We expect Ninja Codes to offer
particular value in scenarios where the conspicuous appearances of conventional
fiducial markers make them undesirable for aesthetic and other reasons.

### [3] [Robust Driving QA through Metadata-Grounded Context and Task-Specific Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19001)
*Seungjun Yu,Junsung Park,Youngsun Lim,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个两阶段的自动驾驶视觉语言问答系统，通过精心设计的提示和上下文增强，显著提升了在感知、预测和规划任务上的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动驾驶中高级感知、预测和规划问题的问答需求，利用预训练视觉语言模型但需要更好的提示工程和上下文信息

Method: 两阶段方法：第一阶段使用Qwen2.5-VL-32B模型，结合六摄像头输入、历史时间窗口和思维链提示；第二阶段增加场景元数据和任务特定指令，并使用自一致性集成提高可靠性

Result: 在驾驶QA基准测试中显著优于基线模型：第一阶段达到65.1%准确率，自一致性提升至66.85%，第二阶段达到67.37%，在严重视觉干扰下仍保持96%准确率

Conclusion: 精心设计的提示工程和上下文增强可以大幅提升预训练视觉语言模型在高级驾驶问答任务中的性能

Abstract: We present a two-phase vision-language QA system for autonomous driving that
answers high-level perception, prediction, and planning questions. In Phase-1,
a large multimodal LLM (Qwen2.5-VL-32B) is conditioned on six-camera inputs, a
short temporal window of history, and a chain-of-thought prompt with few-shot
exemplars. A self-consistency ensemble (multiple sampled reasoning chains)
further improves answer reliability. In Phase-2, we augment the prompt with
nuScenes scene metadata (object annotations, ego-vehicle state, etc.) and
category-specific question instructions (separate prompts for perception,
prediction, planning tasks). In experiments on a driving QA benchmark, our
approach significantly outperforms the baseline Qwen2.5 models. For example,
using 5 history frames and 10-shot prompting in Phase-1 yields 65.1% overall
accuracy (vs.62.61% with zero-shot); applying self-consistency raises this to
66.85%. Phase-2 achieves 67.37% overall. Notably, the system maintains 96%
accuracy under severe visual corruption. These results demonstrate that
carefully engineered prompts and contextual grounding can greatly enhance
high-level driving QA with pretrained vision-language models.

### [4] [$Δ$t-Mamba3D: A Time-Aware Spatio-Temporal State-Space Model for Breast Cancer Risk Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19003)
*Zhengbo Zhou,Dooman Arefan,Margarita Zuley,Shandong Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Time-Aware Δt-Mamba3D模型，用于解决纵向医学图像分析中高分辨率图像序列在非均匀时间间隔下的建模挑战


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法无法充分利用纵向医学图像中的空间和时间信息，要么将空间信息压缩为向量，要么使用计算效率低且不兼容非均匀时间步长的时空模型

Method: 采用状态空间架构，包含连续时间选择性扫描机制（显式整合检查时间间隔）和多尺度3D邻域融合模块（捕获时空关系）

Result: 在乳腺癌风险预测基准测试中表现优异，验证c-index提升2-5个百分点，1-5年AUC得分高于现有的循环、transformer和状态空间模型

Conclusion: 该模型能够高效处理长而复杂的乳腺筛查历史，为纵向图像分析提供了新框架

Abstract: Longitudinal analysis of sequential radiological images is hampered by a
fundamental data challenge: how to effectively model a sequence of
high-resolution images captured at irregular time intervals. This data
structure contains indispensable spatial and temporal cues that current methods
fail to fully exploit. Models often compromise by either collapsing spatial
information into vectors or applying spatio-temporal models that are
computationally inefficient and incompatible with non-uniform time steps. We
address this challenge with Time-Aware $\Delta$t-Mamba3D, a novel state-space
architecture adapted for longitudinal medical imaging. Our model simultaneously
encodes irregular inter-visit intervals and rich spatio-temporal context while
remaining computationally efficient. Its core innovation is a continuous-time
selective scanning mechanism that explicitly integrates the true time
difference between exams into its state transitions. This is complemented by a
multi-scale 3D neighborhood fusion module that robustly captures
spatio-temporal relationships. In a comprehensive breast cancer risk prediction
benchmark using sequential screening mammogram exams, our model shows superior
performance, improving the validation c-index by 2-5 percentage points and
achieving higher 1-5 year AUC scores compared to established variants of
recurrent, transformer, and state-space models. Thanks to its linear
complexity, the model can efficiently process long and complex patient
screening histories of mammograms, forming a new framework for longitudinal
image analysis.

*Aritra Bhowmik,Denis Korzhenkov,Cees G. M. Snoek,Amirhossein Habibian,Mohsen Ghafoorian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种运动中心对齐框架，通过从预训练视频编码器中学习解耦的运动子空间，并将其与文本到视频扩散模型的潜在特征对齐，以生成更符合物理常识的视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到视频扩散模型在生成时间连贯和物理合理的运动方面存在不足，主要原因是模型对复杂运动的理解不够充分。现有方法通过将扩散模型特征与预训练视频编码器特征对齐，但这些编码器的特征混合了视频外观和动态信息，限制了对齐效果。

Method: 提出运动中心对齐框架：1）从预训练视频编码器中学习解耦的运动子空间，该子空间通过预测真实光流进行优化以确保捕获真实运动动态；2）将文本到视频扩散模型的潜在特征与这个新的子空间对齐，使生成模型能够内化运动知识。

Result: 该方法在VideoPhy、VideoPhy2、VBench和VBench-2.0上的实证评估以及用户研究表明，能够改进最先进视频扩散模型的物理常识性，同时保持对文本提示的遵循。

Conclusion: 通过解耦运动子空间与扩散模型特征对齐的方法，有效提升了文本到视频生成的运动质量和物理合理性。

Abstract: Text-to-video diffusion models have enabled high-quality video synthesis, yet
often fail to generate temporally coherent and physically plausible motion. A
key reason is the models' insufficient understanding of complex motions that
natural videos often entail. Recent works tackle this problem by aligning
diffusion model features with those from pretrained video encoders. However,
these encoders mix video appearance and dynamics into entangled features,
limiting the benefit of such alignment. In this paper, we propose a
motion-centric alignment framework that learns a disentangled motion subspace
from a pretrained video encoder. This subspace is optimized to predict
ground-truth optical flow, ensuring it captures true motion dynamics. We then
align the latent features of a text-to-video diffusion model to this new
subspace, enabling the generative model to internalize motion knowledge and
generate more plausible videos. Our method improves the physical commonsense in
a state-of-the-art video diffusion model, while preserving adherence to textual
prompts, as evidenced by empirical evaluations on VideoPhy, VideoPhy2, VBench,
and VBench-2.0, along with a user study.

### [6] [PoSh: Using Scene Graphs To Guide LLMs-as-a-Judge For Detailed Image Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19060)
*Amith Ananthram,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Lorena A. Bradford,Julia Demarest,Adam Purvis,Keith Krut,Robert Stein,Rina Elster Pantalony,Mohit Bansal,Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoSh是一个用于详细图像描述的评估指标，它使用场景图作为结构化评分标准来指导LLMs作为评判者，产生基于细粒度错误的聚合分数。该研究还引入了DOCENT数据集来验证PoSh的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的标准评估指标（如CIDEr、SPICE）是为短文本设计的，无法有效评估长文本的详细图像描述，特别是对属性和关系附着的敏感性不足。需要一种能够定位特定文本跨度错误的评估方法。

Method: 提出PoSh指标，利用场景图作为结构化评分标准，指导大型语言模型作为评判者。同时创建DOCENT数据集，包含艺术品、专家撰写的参考描述和模型生成的描述，并由艺术史学生提供细粒度和粗略的质量判断。

Result: PoSh在DOCENT数据集上与人类判断的相关性比最佳开放权重替代方案强0.05 Spearman ρ，对图像类型具有鲁棒性，并且能够作为有效的奖励函数，优于标准监督微调。

Conclusion: PoSh是一个可复制、可解释且比现有指标更能代表人类评分者的评估指标。通过PoSh和DOCENT，作者希望推动辅助文本生成等重要领域的发展。

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced into detailed image
description, evaluation remains a challenge. Standard metrics (e.g. CIDEr,
SPICE) were designed for short texts and tuned to recognize errors that are now
uncommon, such as object misidentification. In contrast, long texts require
sensitivity to attribute and relation attachments and scores that localize
errors to particular text spans. In this work, we introduce PoSh, a metric for
detailed image description that uses scene graphs as structured rubrics to
guide LLMs-as-a-Judge, producing aggregate scores grounded in fine-grained
errors (e.g. mistakes in compositional understanding). PoSh is replicable,
interpretable and a better proxy for human raters than existing metrics
(including GPT4o-as-a-Judge). To validate PoSh, we introduce a challenging new
dataset, DOCENT. This novel benchmark contains artwork, paired with
expert-written references, and model-generated descriptions, augmented with
granular and coarse judgments of their quality from art history students. Thus,
DOCENT enables evaluating both detailed image description metrics and detailed
image description itself in a challenging new domain. We show that PoSh
achieves stronger correlations (+0.05 Spearman $\rho$) with the human judgments
in DOCENT than the best open-weight alternatives, is robust to image type
(using CapArena, an existing dataset of web imagery) and is a capable reward
function, outperforming standard supervised fine-tuning. Then, using PoSh, we
characterize the performance of open and closed models in describing the
paintings, sketches and statues in DOCENT and find that foundation models
struggle to achieve full, error-free coverage of images with rich scene
dynamics, establishing a demanding new task to gauge VLM progress. Through both
PoSh and DOCENT, we hope to enable advances in important areas such as
assistive text generation.

### [7] [UniHPR: Unified Human Pose Representation via Singular Value Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19078)
*Zhongyu Jiang,Wenhao Chai,Lei Li,Zhuoran Zhou,Cheng-Yen Yang,Jenq-Neng Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出UniHPR统一人体姿态表示学习框架，通过新颖的奇异值对比学习损失对齐图像、2D和3D人体姿态嵌入，在人体姿态估计任务中取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏对不同模态人体姿态表示之间相关性的系统研究，特别是在对比学习范式下。作为人本应用的重要组成部分，统一的人体姿态表示对下游任务至关重要。

Method: 提出UniHPR统一学习框架，使用基于奇异值的对比学习损失同时对齐图像、2D和3D人体姿态嵌入，支持多模态融合和生成。

Result: 在Human3.6M数据集上MPJPE达到49.9mm，在3DPW数据集上PA-MPJPE达到51.6mm；在Human3.6M上实现2D和3D姿态检索，检索误差为9.24mm。

Conclusion: UniHPR通过新颖的对比学习损失有效对齐多模态人体姿态表示，在姿态估计和检索任务中表现优异，为人体姿态相关应用提供了统一的表示基础。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing effective
alignment pipelines to generate unified representations from different
modalities for multi-modal fusion and generation. As an important component of
Human-Centric applications, Human Pose representations are critical in many
downstream tasks, such as Human Pose Estimation, Action Recognition,
Human-Computer Interaction, Object tracking, etc. Human Pose representations or
embeddings can be extracted from images, 2D keypoints, 3D skeletons, mesh
models, and lots of other modalities. Yet, there are limited instances where
the correlation among all of those representations has been clearly researched
using a contrastive paradigm. In this paper, we propose UniHPR, a unified Human
Pose Representation learning pipeline, which aligns Human Pose embeddings from
images, 2D and 3D human poses. To align more than two data representations at
the same time, we propose a novel singular value-based contrastive learning
loss, which better aligns different modalities and further boosts performance.
To evaluate the effectiveness of the aligned representation, we choose 2D and
3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) as our evaluation tasks. In our evaluation, with
a simple 3D human pose decoder, UniHPR achieves remarkable performance metrics:
MPJPE 49.9mm on the Human3.6M dataset and PA-MPJPE 51.6mm on the 3DPW dataset
with cross-domain evaluation. Meanwhile, we are able to achieve 2D and 3D pose
retrieval with our unified human pose representations in Human3.6M dataset,
where the retrieval error is 9.24mm in MPJPE.

TL;DR: 该研究提出将注意力机制集成到3D U-Net模型中，结合数字图像处理技术解决脑肿瘤分割中的不规则形状、模糊边界和类别不平衡问题，在BraTS 2020数据集上取得了优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准U-Net模型在脑肿瘤分割中面临准确描绘不规则形状和模糊边界区域的挑战，同时高分辨率MRI数据训练需要大量计算资源且存在类别不平衡问题。

Method: 将注意力机制集成到3D U-Net模型中，使模型能够捕捉复杂细节并优先处理信息丰富的区域；同时使用基于数字图像处理的肿瘤检测算法解决训练数据不平衡问题。

Conclusion: 提出的模型有效改善了脑肿瘤分割性能，为临床环境中可靠诊断提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: In the realm of medical diagnostics, rapid advancements in Artificial
Intelligence (AI) have significantly yielded remarkable improvements in brain
tumor segmentation. Encoder-Decoder architectures, such as U-Net, have played a
transformative role by effectively extracting meaningful representations in 3D
brain tumor segmentation from Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. However,
standard U-Net models encounter challenges in accurately delineating tumor
regions, especially when dealing with irregular shapes and ambiguous
boundaries. Additionally, training robust segmentation models on
high-resolution MRI data, such as the BraTS datasets, necessitates high
computational resources and often faces challenges associated with class
imbalance. This study proposes the integration of the attention mechanism into
the 3D U-Net model, enabling the model to capture intricate details and
prioritize informative regions during the segmentation process. Additionally, a
tumor detection algorithm based on digital image processing techniques is
utilized to address the issue of imbalanced training data and mitigate bias.
This study aims to enhance the performance of brain tumor segmentation,
ultimately improving the reliability of diagnosis. The proposed model is
thoroughly evaluated and assessed on the BraTS 2020 dataset using various
performance metrics to accomplish this goal. The obtained results indicate that
the model outperformed related studies, exhibiting dice of 0.975, specificity
of 0.988, and sensitivity of 0.995, indicating the efficacy of the proposed
model in improving brain tumor segmentation, offering valuable insights for
reliable diagnosis in clinical settings.

### [9] [A Novel Approach to Breast Cancer Segmentation using U-Net Model with Attention Mechanisms and FedProx](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19118)
*Eyad Gad,Mustafa Abou Khatwa,Mustafa A. Elattar,Sahar Selim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究应用联邦近端(FedProx)方法处理非独立同分布的超声乳腺癌图像数据集，结合改进的U-Net模型和注意力机制，在保护患者隐私的同时实现了96%的肿瘤分割准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺癌是女性主要死因，需要早期检测和准确诊断。超声成像虽可靠经济，但医疗数据敏感性使得开发准确且保护隐私的AI模型具有挑战性。联邦学习虽能保护隐私，但非独立同分布数据会影响模型准确性和泛化能力。

Method: 应用联邦近端(FedProx)方法处理非独立同分布超声乳腺癌数据集，并采用改进的U-Net模型结合注意力机制来增强肿瘤分割准确性。

Result: 该方法训练出的全局模型达到了96%的准确率，有效提升了肿瘤分割准确性，同时保护了患者隐私。

Conclusion: FedProx方法在非独立同分布的本地医疗数据集上训练精确机器学习模型具有潜力，是解决医疗数据隐私和准确性平衡问题的有前景方法。

Abstract: Breast cancer is a leading cause of death among women worldwide, emphasizing
the need for early detection and accurate diagnosis. As such Ultrasound
Imaging, a reliable and cost-effective tool, is used for this purpose, however
the sensitive nature of medical data makes it challenging to develop accurate
and private artificial intelligence models. A solution is Federated Learning as
it is a promising technique for distributed machine learning on sensitive
medical data while preserving patient privacy. However, training on
non-Independent and non-Identically Distributed (non-IID) local datasets can
impact the accuracy and generalization of the trained model, which is crucial
for accurate tumour boundary delineation in BC segmentation. This study aims to
tackle this challenge by applying the Federated Proximal (FedProx) method to
non-IID Ultrasonic Breast Cancer Imaging datasets. Moreover, we focus on
enhancing tumour segmentation accuracy by incorporating a modified U-Net model
with attention mechanisms. Our approach resulted in a global model with 96%
accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in enhancing tumour
segmentation accuracy while preserving patient privacy. Our findings suggest
that FedProx has the potential to be a promising approach for training precise
machine learning models on non-IID local medical datasets.

*Yunzhe Wang,Soham Hans,Volkan Ustun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了X-Ego-CS数据集和CECL方法，用于研究复杂3D环境中的多智能体决策，通过同步的第一人称视角视频流促进团队战术意识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频理解方法主要依赖第三人称视角，忽略了同步、自我中心的多智能体学习特性，需要从个体视角研究团队战术的涌现。

Method: 构建X-Ego-CS数据集（124小时专业级CS2比赛视频），提出跨自我中心对比学习（CECL），通过对齐队友的自我中心视觉流来培养团队战术意识。

Result: 在队友-对手位置预测任务中，CECL有效提升了智能体从单一第一人称视角推断队友和对手位置的能力。

Conclusion: X-Ego-CS和CECL为电子竞技中的跨自我中心多智能体基准测试奠定了基础，将游戏理解定位为多智能体建模和战术学习的测试平台。

Abstract: Human team tactics emerge from each player's individual perspective and their
ability to anticipate, interpret, and adapt to teammates' intentions. While
advances in video understanding have improved the modeling of team interactions
in sports, most existing work relies on third-person broadcast views and
overlooks the synchronous, egocentric nature of multi-agent learning. We
introduce X-Ego-CS, a benchmark dataset consisting of 124 hours of gameplay
footage from 45 professional-level matches of the popular e-sports game
Counter-Strike 2, designed to facilitate research on multi-agent
decision-making in complex 3D environments. X-Ego-CS provides cross-egocentric
video streams that synchronously capture all players' first-person perspectives
along with state-action trajectories. Building on this resource, we propose
Cross-Ego Contrastive Learning (CECL), which aligns teammates' egocentric
visual streams to foster team-level tactical situational awareness from an
individual's perspective. We evaluate CECL on a teammate-opponent location
prediction task, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing an agent's
ability to infer both teammate and opponent positions from a single
first-person view using state-of-the-art video encoders. Together, X-Ego-CS and
CECL establish a foundation for cross-egocentric multi-agent benchmarking in
esports. More broadly, our work positions gameplay understanding as a testbed
for multi-agent modeling and tactical learning, with implications for
spatiotemporal reasoning and human-AI teaming in both virtual and real-world
domains. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/HATS-ICT/x-ego.

motion dynamics directly from visual input. On multiple datasets, FootFormer
achieves statistically significantly better or equivalent estimates of foot
pressure distributions, foot contact maps, and center of mass (CoM), as
compared with existing methods that generate one or two of those measures.
Furthermore, FootFormer achieves SOTA performance in estimating
stability-predictive components (CoP, CoM, BoS) used in classic kinesiology
metrics. Code and data are available at

*Warisa Nusrat,Mostafijur Rahman,Ayatullah Faruk Mollah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文应用六种深度卷积网络对疟疾细胞图像进行分类，其中残差注意力网络和XceptionNet表现最佳，准确率分别达到97.28%和97.55%，证明了深度学习在疟疾自动检测中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 疟疾主要通过雌性按蚊传播，常导致0-5岁儿童死亡。传统显微镜观察血涂片图像的方法依赖专家经验，容易因专业知识不足和人工参与导致误诊，因此需要计算机辅助的自动诊断方法。

Method: 使用六种深度卷积网络（AlexNet、XceptionNet、VGG-19、残差注意力网络、DenseNet-121和自定义CNN）从血细胞图像中提取深层特征，并分类为疟疾感染细胞或健康细胞。

Result: 在公开的疟疾细胞图像数据集上，残差注意力网络和XceptionNet表现最佳，平均准确率分别为97.28%和97.55%，优于其他相关方法。

Conclusion: 这些发现高度支持深度学习驱动的方法在疟疾自动可靠检测中的实际应用前景，同时最大限度地减少了直接人工参与。

Abstract: Malaria, which primarily spreads with the bite of female anopheles mosquitos,
often leads to death of people - specifically children in the age-group of 0-5
years. Clinical experts identify malaria by observing RBCs in blood smeared
images with a microscope. Lack of adequate professional knowledge and skills,
and most importantly manual involvement may cause incorrect diagnosis.
Therefore, computer aided automatic diagnosis stands as a preferred substitute.
In this paper, well-demonstrated deep networks have been applied to extract
deep intrinsic features from blood cell images and thereafter classify them as
malaria infected or healthy cells. Among the six deep convolutional networks
employed in this work viz. AlexNet, XceptionNet, VGG-19, Residual Attention
Network, DenseNet-121 and Custom-CNN. Residual Attention Network and
XceptionNet perform relatively better than the rest on a publicly available
malaria cell image dataset. They yield an average accuracy of 97.28% and 97.55%
respectively, that surpasses other related methods on the same dataset. These
findings highly encourage the reality of deep learning driven method for
automatic and reliable detection of malaria while minimizing direct manual
involvement.

TL;DR: PruneHal是一种无需训练、基于自适应KV缓存剪枝的方法，通过增强模型对关键视觉信息的关注来缓解多模态大语言模型中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型中的幻觉问题仍然是一个主要挑战，现有解决方案要么需要额外训练数据，要么在推理时引入外部或内部信息，这些方法都会带来额外的计算成本。研究发现幻觉与视觉令牌注意力不足密切相关，冗余的视觉令牌分散了模型注意力。

Method: 提出PruneHal方法，利用自适应KV缓存剪枝来增强模型对关键视觉信息的关注。该方法无需额外训练，几乎不增加推理成本，且与不同解码策略兼容。

Result: 在多个主流幻觉评估基准上使用四种主流MLLMs进行评估，获得了稳健且出色的结果，证明了方法的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: PruneHal是首个将令牌剪枝应用于MLLMs幻觉缓解的方法，具有训练免费、成本低、模型无关等优势，能有效缓解多模态大语言模型中的幻觉问题。

Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant
progress in recent years, the issue of hallucinations remains a major
challenge. To mitigate this phenomenon, existing solutions either introduce
additional data for further training or incorporate external or internal
information during inference. However, these approaches inevitably introduce
extra computational costs. In this paper, we observe that hallucinations in
MLLMs are strongly associated with insufficient attention allocated to visual
tokens. In particular, the presence of redundant visual tokens disperses the
model's attention, preventing it from focusing on the most informative ones. As
a result, critical visual cues are often under-attended, which in turn
exacerbates the occurrence of hallucinations. Building on this observation, we
propose \textbf{PruneHal}, a training-free, simple yet effective method that
leverages adaptive KV cache pruning to enhance the model's focus on critical
visual information, thereby mitigating hallucinations. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to apply token pruning for hallucination mitigation
in MLLMs. Notably, our method don't require additional training and incurs
nearly no extra inference cost. Moreover, PruneHal is model-agnostic and can be
seamlessly integrated with different decoding strategies, including those
specifically designed for hallucination mitigation. We evaluate PruneHal on
several widely used hallucination evaluation benchmarks using four mainstream
MLLMs, achieving robust and outstanding results that highlight the
effectiveness and superiority of our method. Our code will be publicly
available.

*Takehiro Aoshima,Yusuke Shinohara,Park Byeongseon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Video Consistency Distance (VCD)指标，通过基于奖励的微调框架增强视频扩散模型的时间一致性，特别针对图像到视频生成任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的奖励函数主要关注整个生成视频序列的质量，但在图像到视频生成任务中，时间一致性往往受到影响，需要专门解决这个问题。

Method: 在视频帧特征的频率空间中定义VCD指标，通过频域分析有效捕捉帧信息，并将其集成到基于奖励的微调框架中。

Result: 在多个I2V数据集上的实验结果表明，使用VCD微调的视频生成模型显著增强了时间一致性，且不降低其他性能指标。

Conclusion: VCD是一种有效的度量标准，能够专门改善视频生成模型的时间一致性，为图像到视频生成任务提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Reward-based fine-tuning of video diffusion models is an effective approach
to improve the quality of generated videos, as it can fine-tune models without
requiring real-world video datasets. However, it can sometimes be limited to
specific performances because conventional reward functions are mainly aimed at
enhancing the quality across the whole generated video sequence, such as
aesthetic appeal and overall consistency. Notably, the temporal consistency of
the generated video often suffers when applying previous approaches to
image-to-video (I2V) generation tasks. To address this limitation, we propose
Video Consistency Distance (VCD), a novel metric designed to enhance temporal
consistency, and fine-tune a model with the reward-based fine-tuning framework.
To achieve coherent temporal consistency relative to a conditioning image, VCD
is defined in the frequency space of video frame features to capture frame
information effectively through frequency-domain analysis. Experimental results
across multiple I2V datasets demonstrate that fine-tuning a video generation
model with VCD significantly enhances temporal consistency without degrading
other performance compared to the previous method.

TL;DR: Dream4Drive是一个用于增强自动驾驶感知任务的合成数据生成框架，通过3D感知引导图和3D资产渲染生成多视角逼真视频，显著提升角案例感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有驾驶世界模型主要关注生成质量和可控性指标，但忽视了感知任务的评估，而这对自动驾驶性能至关重要。现有方法需要先在合成数据上预训练再在真实数据上微调，导致训练周期翻倍。

Method: 首先将输入视频分解为多个3D感知引导图，然后将3D资产渲染到这些引导图上，最后微调驾驶世界模型生成编辑后的多视角逼真视频，用于训练下游感知模型。

Result: Dream4Drive能够大规模生成多视角角案例，显著提升自动驾驶中的角案例感知能力。实验表明该框架能有效提升下游感知模型在各种训练周期下的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模生成多视角角案例提供了前所未有的灵活性，并贡献了DriveObj3D大规模3D资产数据集，推动了自动驾驶感知研究的发展。

Abstract: Recent advancements in driving world models enable controllable generation of
high-quality RGB videos or multimodal videos. Existing methods primarily focus
on metrics related to generation quality and controllability. However, they
often overlook the evaluation of downstream perception tasks, which are
$\mathbf{really\ crucial}$ for the performance of autonomous driving. Existing
methods usually leverage a training strategy that first pretrains on synthetic
data and finetunes on real data, resulting in twice the epochs compared to the
baseline (real data only). When we double the epochs in the baseline, the
benefit of synthetic data becomes negligible. To thoroughly demonstrate the
benefit of synthetic data, we introduce Dream4Drive, a novel synthetic data
generation framework designed for enhancing the downstream perception tasks.
Dream4Drive first decomposes the input video into several 3D-aware guidance
maps and subsequently renders the 3D assets onto these guidance maps. Finally,
the driving world model is fine-tuned to produce the edited, multi-view
photorealistic videos, which can be used to train the downstream perception
models. Dream4Drive enables unprecedented flexibility in generating multi-view
corner cases at scale, significantly boosting corner case perception in
autonomous driving. To facilitate future research, we also contribute a
large-scale 3D asset dataset named DriveObj3D, covering the typical categories
in driving scenarios and enabling diverse 3D-aware video editing. We conduct
comprehensive experiments to show that Dream4Drive can effectively boost the
performance of downstream perception models under various training epochs.

Motivation: 现有动态场景重建方法在不同场景下表现不一致，缺乏能统一应对各种动态挑战的有效方法。

Method: 提出MoE-GS统一框架，集成多个专用专家，使用体积感知像素路由器通过可微分权重溅射将高斯级权重投影到像素空间，实现空间和时间一致的结果。

Result: 在N3V和Technicolor数据集上的广泛实验表明，MoE-GS在提升效率的同时持续优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: MoE-GS是首个将混合专家技术融入动态高斯溅射的方法，通过专家集成和优化策略实现了性能与效率的平衡。

Abstract: Recent advances in dynamic scene reconstruction have significantly benefited
from 3D Gaussian Splatting, yet existing methods show inconsistent performance
across diverse scenes, indicating no single approach effectively handles all
dynamic challenges. To overcome these limitations, we propose Mixture of
Experts for Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (MoE-GS), a unified framework
integrating multiple specialized experts via a novel Volume-aware Pixel Router.
Our router adaptively blends expert outputs by projecting volumetric
Gaussian-level weights into pixel space through differentiable weight
splatting, ensuring spatially and temporally coherent results. Although MoE-GS
improves rendering quality, the increased model capacity and reduced FPS are
inherent to the MoE architecture. To mitigate this, we explore two
complementary directions: (1) single-pass multi-expert rendering and gate-aware
Gaussian pruning, which improve efficiency within the MoE framework, and (2) a
distillation strategy that transfers MoE performance to individual experts,
enabling lightweight deployment without architectural changes. To the best of
our knowledge, MoE-GS is the first approach incorporating Mixture-of-Experts
techniques into dynamic Gaussian splatting. Extensive experiments on the N3V
and Technicolor datasets demonstrate that MoE-GS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods with improved efficiency. Video demonstrations are

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D成像雷达具有低成本、远距离检测和精确速度测量的优势，但其稀疏点云和低分辨率限制了物体几何表示和多模态融合性能。

Method: 通过图像和雷达数据估计物体二次表面参数，生成密集深度图；在图像分支中引导特征从透视视图转换到BEV空间；在表面伪点分支中生成密集伪点云；采用基于pillar的方法处理点云特征，最终在BEV空间使用标准2D骨干网络和检测头进行目标检测。

Conclusion: SFGFusion通过表面拟合指导的多模态融合方法，显著提升了4D成像雷达与相机融合的目标检测性能，解决了雷达点稀疏和分辨率低的问题。

Abstract: 3D object detection is essential for autonomous driving. As an emerging
sensor, 4D imaging radar offers advantages as low cost, long-range detection,
and accurate velocity measurement, making it highly suitable for object
detection. However, its sparse point clouds and low resolution limit object
geometric representation and hinder multi-modal fusion. In this study, we
introduce SFGFusion, a novel camera-4D imaging radar detection network guided
by surface fitting. By estimating quadratic surface parameters of objects from
image and radar data, the explicit surface fitting model enhances spatial
representation and cross-modal interaction, enabling more reliable prediction
of fine-grained dense depth. The predicted depth serves two purposes: 1) in an
image branch to guide the transformation of image features from perspective
view (PV) to a unified bird's-eye view (BEV) for multi-modal fusion, improving
spatial mapping accuracy; and 2) in a surface pseudo-point branch to generate
dense pseudo-point cloud, mitigating the radar point sparsity. The original
radar point cloud is also encoded in a separate radar branch. These two point
cloud branches adopt a pillar-based method and subsequently transform the
features into the BEV space. Finally, a standard 2D backbone and detection head
are used to predict object labels and bounding boxes from BEV features.
Experimental results show that SFGFusion effectively fuses camera and 4D radar
features, achieving superior performance on the TJ4DRadSet and view-of-delft
(VoD) object detection benchmarks.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效解决GEO空间目标检测中的信号弱和背景干扰问题

Abstract: Space objects in Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) present significant
detection challenges in optical imaging due to weak signals, complex stellar
backgrounds, and environmental interference. In this paper, we enhance
high-frequency features of GEO targets while suppressing background noise at
the single-frame level through wavelet transform. Building on this, we propose
a multi-frame temporal trajectory completion scheme centered on the Hungarian
algorithm for globally optimal cross-frame matching. To effectively mitigate
missing and false detections, a series of key steps including temporal matching
and interpolation completion, temporal-consistency-based noise filtering, and
progressive trajectory refinement are designed in the post-processing pipeline.
Experimental results on the public SpotGEO dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an F_1 score of 90.14%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决协作感知中带宽限制问题，现有方法只传输前景特征而丢弃了包含重要上下文的背景信息，影响了感知性能。

Method: 采用课程学习策略，早期利用背景线索但逐步剪除，迫使模型将上下文信息内化到前景表示中，而不需要传输背景本身。

Result: 在模拟和真实世界基准测试中，FadeLead在不同带宽设置下均优于现有方法，证明了上下文增强前景共享的有效性。

Conclusion: FadeLead通过将背景上下文封装到前景特征中，在带宽受限条件下显著提升了协作感知性能，为自动驾驶的长尾场景提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Collaborative perception enhances the reliability and spatial coverage of
autonomous vehicles by sharing complementary information across vehicles,
offering a promising solution to long-tail scenarios that challenge
single-vehicle perception. However, the bandwidth constraints of vehicular
networks make transmitting the entire feature map impractical. Recent methods,
therefore, adopt a foreground-centric paradigm, transmitting only predicted
foreground-region features while discarding the background, which encodes
essential context. We propose FadeLead, a foreground-centric framework that
overcomes this limitation by learning to encapsulate background context into
compact foreground features during training. At the core of our design is a
curricular learning strategy that leverages background cues early on but
progressively prunes them away, forcing the model to internalize context into
foreground representations without transmitting background itself. Extensive
experiments on both simulated and real-world benchmarks show that FadeLead
outperforms prior methods under different bandwidth settings, underscoring the
effectiveness of context-enriched foreground sharing.

Abstract: We present a survey on 4D generation and reconstruction, a fast-evolving
subfield of computer graphics whose developments have been propelled by recent
advances in neural fields, geometric and motion deep learning, as well 3D
generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). While our survey is not the first
of its kind, we build our coverage of the domain from a unique and distinctive
perspective of 4D representations\/}, to model 3D geometry evolving over time
while exhibiting motion and interaction. Specifically, instead of offering an
exhaustive enumeration of many works, we take a more selective approach by
focusing on representative works to highlight both the desirable properties and
ensuing challenges of each representation under different computation,
application, and data scenarios. The main take-away message we aim to convey to
the readers is on how to select and then customize the appropriate 4D
representations for their tasks. Organizationally, we separate the 4D
representations based on three key pillars: geometry, motion, and interaction.
Our discourse will not only encompass the most popular representations of
today, such as neural radiance fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS),
but also bring attention to relatively under-explored representations in the 4D
context, such as structured models and long-range motions. Throughout our
survey, we will reprise the role of large language models (LLMs) and video
foundational models (VFMs) in a variety of 4D applications, while steering our
discussion towards their current limitations and how they can be addressed. We
also provide a dedicated coverage on what 4D datasets are currently available,
as well as what is lacking, in driving the subfield forward. Project

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) must handle complex degradations
and inherent reconstruction ambiguities. While generative models have improved
perceptual quality, a key trade-off remains with computational cost. One-step
diffusion models offer speed but often produce structural inaccuracies due to
distillation artifacts. To address this, we propose a novel SR framework that
enhances a one-step diffusion model using a ControlNet mechanism for semantic
edge guidance. This integrates edge information to provide dynamic structural
control during single-pass inference. We also introduce a hybrid loss combining
L2, LPIPS, and an edge-aware AME loss to optimize for pixel accuracy,
perceptual quality, and geometric precision. Experiments show our method
effectively improves structural integrity and realism while maintaining the
efficiency of one-step generation, achieving a superior balance between output
quality and inference speed. The results of test datasets will be published at

Method: 使用MobileNetV4作为骨干网络，引入阶段正交知识蒸馏策略从教师网络(ResNet18)向学生网络传递知识，集成无参数注意力机制，并采用混合损失训练策略。

Result: 在三个自收集数据集上平均识别准确率达92.12%，仅消耗136.16 pJ能量，处理速度为8.84动作/秒，解码速度比领先方法快2倍。

Conclusion: MobiAct实现了低能耗、低计算量的MAV动作识别，在保持高精度的同时具有最快的动作解码速度，证明了其在MAV动作识别中的高效性。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient recognition of Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) motion is
essential for enabling real-time perception and coordination in autonomous
aerial swarm. However, most existing approaches rely on large, computationally
intensive models that are unsuitable for resource-limited MAV platforms, which
results in a trade-off between recognition accuracy and inference speed. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight MAV action
recognition framework, MobiAct, designed to achieve high accuracy with low
computational cost. Specifically, MobiAct adopts MobileNetV4 as the backbone
network and introduces a Stage-wise Orthogonal Knowledge Distillation (SOKD)
strategy to effectively transfer MAV motion features from a teacher network
(ResNet18) to a student network, thereby enhancing knowledge transfer
efficiency. Furthermore, a parameter-free attention mechanism is integrated
into the architecture to improve recognition accuracy without increasing model
complexity. In addition, a hybrid loss training strategy is developed to
combine multiple loss objectives, which ensures stable and robust optimization
during training. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MobiAct
achieves low-energy and low-computation MAV action recognition, while
maintaining the fastest action decoding speed among compared methods. Across
all three self-collected datasets, MobiAct achieves an average recognition
accuracy of 92.12%, while consuming only 136.16 pJ of energy and processing
recognition at a rate of 8.84 actions per second. Notably, MobiAct decodes
actions up to 2 times faster than the leading method, with highly comparable
recognition accuracy, highlighting its superior efficiency in MAV action
recognition.

Conclusion: D2D框架成功克服了检测器不可微的限制，有效提升了文本到图像生成模型的计数能力

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved strong performance in
semantic alignment, yet they still struggle with generating the correct number
of objects specified in prompts. Existing approaches typically incorporate
auxiliary counting networks as external critics to enhance numeracy. However,
since these critics must provide gradient guidance during generation, they are
restricted to regression-based models that are inherently differentiable, thus
excluding detector-based models with superior counting ability, whose
count-via-enumeration nature is non-differentiable. To overcome this
limitation, we propose Detector-to-Differentiable (D2D), a novel framework that
transforms non-differentiable detection models into differentiable critics,
thereby leveraging their superior counting ability to guide numeracy
generation. Specifically, we design custom activation functions to convert
detector logits into soft binary indicators, which are then used to optimize
the noise prior at inference time with pre-trained T2I models. Our extensive
experiments on SDXL-Turbo, SD-Turbo, and Pixart-DMD across four benchmarks of
varying complexity (low-density, high-density, and multi-object scenarios)
demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements in object counting accuracy
(e.g., boosting up to 13.7% on D2D-Small, a 400-prompt, low-density benchmark),
with minimal degradation in overall image quality and computational overhead.

Abstract: Alzheimer disease is a severe brain disorder that causes harm in various
brain areas and leads to memory damage. The limited availability of labeled
medical data poses a significant challenge for accurate Alzheimer disease
detection. There is a critical need for effective methods to improve the
accuracy of Alzheimer disease detection, considering the scarcity of labeled

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their
large scale often renders them impractical for resource-constrained
environments. This paper introduces Unified Reinforcement and Imitation
Learning (RIL), a novel and efficient training algorithm designed to create
powerful, lightweight VLMs. RIL distinctively combines the strengths of
reinforcement learning with adversarial imitation learning. This enables
smaller student VLMs not only to mimic the sophisticated text generation of
large teacher models but also to systematically improve their generative
capabilities through reinforcement signals. Key to our imitation framework is
an LLM-based discriminator that adeptly distinguishes between student and
teacher outputs, complemented by guidance from multiple large teacher VLMs to
ensure diverse learning. This unified learning strategy, leveraging both
reinforcement and imitation, empowers student models to achieve significant
performance gains, making them competitive with leading closed-source VLMs.
Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that
RIL significantly narrows the performance gap with state-of-the-art open- and
closed-source VLMs and, in several instances, surpasses them.

Abstract: Handwritten signature verification is a crucial aspect of identity
authentication, with applications in various domains such as finance and
e-commerce. However, achieving high accuracy in signature verification remains
challenging due to intra-user variability and the risk of forgery. This paper
introduces a novel approach for dynamic signature verification: the
Temporal-Spatial Graph Attention Transformer (TS-GATR). TS-GATR combines the
Graph Attention Network (GAT) and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to model both
spatial and temporal dependencies in signature data. TS-GATR enhances
verification performance by representing signatures as graphs, where each node
captures dynamic features (e.g. position, velocity, pressure), and by using
attention mechanisms to model their complex relationships. The proposed method
further employs a Dual-Graph Attention Transformer (DGATR) module, which
utilizes k-step and k-nearest neighbor adjacency graphs to model local and
global spatial features, respectively. To capture long-term temporal
dependencies, the model integrates GRU, thereby enhancing its ability to learn
dynamic features during signature verification. Comprehensive experiments
conducted on benchmark datasets such as MSDS and DeepSignDB show that TS-GATR
surpasses current state-of-the-art approaches, consistently achieving lower
Equal Error Rates (EER) across various scenarios.

*Panagiotis Agrafiotis,Begüm Demir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Seabed-Net是一个统一的多任务框架，通过同时预测水深测量和基于像素的海底分类，在浅水环境测绘中实现了协同增益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法将水深测量和海底分类任务分开处理，忽略了它们之间的相互作用，限制了深度学习方法的广泛应用。

Method: 采用双分支编码器分别处理水深估计和海底分类，通过注意力特征融合模块和窗口化Swin-Transformer融合块整合跨任务特征，并使用动态任务不确定性加权平衡目标。

Result: 在两个异质性海岸站点的广泛评估中，相比传统方法和最先进的单任务/多任务基线，水深RMSE降低了10-30%，海底分类准确率提高了8%，空间一致性和栖息地边界清晰度显著改善。

Conclusion: 联合建模深度与海底底质和栖息地能够产生协同增益，为集成浅水测绘提供了稳健的开放解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate, detailed, and regularly updated bathymetry, coupled with complex
semantic content, is essential for under-mapped shallow-water environments
facing increasing climatological and anthropogenic pressures. However, existing
approaches that derive either depth or seabed classes from remote sensing
imagery treat these tasks in isolation, forfeiting the mutual benefits of their
interaction and hindering the broader adoption of deep learning methods. To
address these limitations, we introduce Seabed-Net, a unified multi-task
framework that simultaneously predicts bathymetry and pixel-based seabed
classification from remote sensing imagery of various resolutions. Seabed-Net
employs dual-branch encoders for bathymetry estimation and pixel-based seabed
classification, integrates cross-task features via an Attention Feature Fusion
module and a windowed Swin-Transformer fusion block, and balances objectives
through dynamic task uncertainty weighting. In extensive evaluations at two
heterogeneous coastal sites, it consistently outperforms traditional empirical
models and traditional machine learning regression methods, achieving up to
75\% lower RMSE. It also reduces bathymetric RMSE by 10-30\% compared to
state-of-the-art single-task and multi-task baselines and improves seabed
classification accuracy up to 8\%. Qualitative analyses further demonstrate
enhanced spatial consistency, sharper habitat boundaries, and corrected depth
biases in low-contrast regions. These results confirm that jointly modeling
depth with both substrate and seabed habitats yields synergistic gains,
offering a robust, open solution for integrated shallow-water mapping. Code and
pretrained weights are available at https://github.com/pagraf/Seabed-Net.

Conclusion: 尺度偏移领域泛化是一个重要且复杂的研究方向，本文通过系统性分析和提出的解决方案为该领域提供了新的研究视角和方法。

Abstract: Crowd localization plays a crucial role in visual scene understanding towards
predicting each pedestrian location in a crowd, thus being applicable to
various downstream tasks. However, existing approaches suffer from significant
performance degradation due to discrepancies in head scale distributions (scale
shift) between training and testing data, a challenge known as domain
generalization (DG). This paper aims to comprehend the nature of scale shift
within the context of domain generalization for crowd localization models. To
this end, we address four critical questions: (i) How does scale shift
influence crowd localization in a DG scenario? (ii) How can we quantify this
influence? (iii) What causes this influence? (iv) How to mitigate the
influence? Initially, we conduct a systematic examination of how crowd
localization performance varies with different levels of scale shift. Then, we
establish a benchmark, ScaleBench, and reproduce 20 advanced DG algorithms to
quantify the influence. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the
limitations of existing algorithms and underscore the importance and complexity
of scale shift, a topic that remains insufficiently explored. To deepen our
understanding, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis on scale shift.
Building on these insights, we further propose an effective algorithm called
Causal Feature Decomposition and Anisotropic Processing (Catto) to mitigate the
influence of scale shift in DG settings. Later, we also provide extensive
analytical experiments, revealing four significant insights for future
research. Our results emphasize the importance of this novel and applicable
research direction, which we term Scale Shift Domain Generalization.

### [30] [BrainMCLIP: Brain Image Decoding with Multi-Layer feature Fusion of CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19332)
*Tian Xia,Zihan Ma,Xinlong Wang,Qing Liu,Xiaowei He,Tianming Liu,Yudan Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrainMCLIP提出了一种参数高效的多层融合方法，通过将fMRI信号与CLIP中间层和最终层对齐，无需单独的VAE通路即可实现高质量的图像解码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将fMRI映射到CLIP的最终语义层，忽略了CLIP中间层的丰富物体信息，且与大脑功能层次结构不符。许多方法还添加了参数密集的VAE管道来捕捉视觉细节。

Method: 基于人类视觉系统的功能层次结构，将来自不同视觉区域（低/高级）的fMRI信号与对应的CLIP中间层和最终层对齐，引入跨重建策略和新的多粒度损失函数。

Result: BrainMCLIP在高级语义指标上达到或超越了最先进方法（包括使用VAE管道的方法），同时参数数量减少了71.7%。

Conclusion: 通过利用CLIP中间特征，BrainMCLIP在语义准确性和细节保真度之间取得了良好平衡，无需单独的VAE管道即可有效捕捉视觉细节。

Abstract: Decoding images from fMRI often involves mapping brain activity to CLIP's
final semantic layer. To capture finer visual details, many approaches add a
parameter-intensive VAE-based pipeline. However, these approaches overlook rich
object information within CLIP's intermediate layers and contradicts the
brain's functionally hierarchical. We introduce BrainMCLIP, which pioneers a
parameter-efficient, multi-layer fusion approach guided by human visual
system's functional hierarchy, eliminating the need for such a separate VAE
pathway. BrainMCLIP aligns fMRI signals from functionally distinct visual areas
(low-/high-level) to corresponding intermediate and final CLIP layers,
respecting functional hierarchy. We further introduce a Cross-Reconstruction
strategy and a novel multi-granularity loss. Results show BrainMCLIP achieves
highly competitive performance, particularly excelling on high-level semantic
metrics where it matches or surpasses SOTA(state-of-the-art) methods, including
those using VAE pipelines. Crucially, it achieves this with substantially fewer
parameters, demonstrating a reduction of
71.7\%(Table.\ref{tab:compare_clip_vae}) compared to top VAE-based SOTA
methods, by avoiding the VAE pathway. By leveraging intermediate CLIP features,
it effectively captures visual details often missed by CLIP-only approaches,
striking a compelling balance between semantic accuracy and detail fidelity
without requiring a separate VAE pipeline.

### [31] [From Forecasting to Planning: Policy World Model for Collaborative State-Action Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19654)
*Zhida Zhao,Talas Fu,Yifan Wang,Lijun Wang,Huchuan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Policy World Model (PWM)新范式，将世界建模与轨迹规划统一，通过无动作未来状态预测方案利用世界知识提升规划性能，实现类人预期感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有驾驶世界模型主要用于世界仿真，与轨迹规划分离，缺乏对世界建模如何促进规划的协同机制探索。

Method: 采用统一架构整合世界建模与轨迹规划，提出无动作未来状态预测方案，通过协作状态-动作预测实现预期感知，引入动态增强并行令牌生成机制、上下文引导分词器和自适应动态焦点损失。

Result: 仅使用前视摄像头输入，性能匹配或超越依赖多视角和多模态输入的最先进方法。

Conclusion: PWM范式成功统一世界建模与规划，通过世界知识有效提升规划可靠性，展示了协同机制的潜力。

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in driving world models, their potential for
autonomous systems remains largely untapped: the world models are mostly
learned for world simulation and decoupled from trajectory planning. While
recent efforts aim to unify world modeling and planning in a single framework,
the synergistic facilitation mechanism of world modeling for planning still
requires further exploration. In this work, we introduce a new driving paradigm
named Policy World Model (PWM), which not only integrates world modeling and
trajectory planning within a unified architecture, but is also able to benefit
planning using the learned world knowledge through the proposed action-free
future state forecasting scheme. Through collaborative state-action prediction,
PWM can mimic the human-like anticipatory perception, yielding more reliable
planning performance. To facilitate the efficiency of video forecasting, we
further introduce a dynamically enhanced parallel token generation mechanism,
equipped with a context-guided tokenizer and an adaptive dynamic focal loss.
Despite utilizing only front camera input, our method matches or exceeds
state-of-the-art approaches that rely on multi-view and multi-modal inputs.

*Ying Dai,Wei Yu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的开集词汇图像分割与识别框架，结合EfficientNetB0进行无监督分割和CLIP进行开放词汇识别，在多个基准数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统图像分割方法需要大量标注数据和固定词汇表限制的问题，实现无需训练的开集词汇分割与识别。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：1) 使用EfficientNetB0提取像素特征，通过SVD分解和层次聚类进行无监督分割；2) 使用CLIP的ViT编码分割区域，与文本嵌入在共享特征空间对齐进行识别。

Result: 在COCO、ADE20K和PASCAL VOC基准测试中，在Hungarian mIoU、精度、召回率和F1分数方面均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了无需训练的开集词汇分割与识别的有效性、灵活性和泛化能力。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel training-free framework for open-vocabulary image
segmentation and object recognition (OVSR), which leverages EfficientNetB0, a
convolutional neural network, for unsupervised segmentation and CLIP, a
vision-language model, for open-vocabulary object recognition. The proposed
framework adopts a two stage pipeline: unsupervised image segmentation followed
by segment-level recognition via vision-language alignment. In the first stage,
pixel-wise features extracted from EfficientNetB0 are decomposed using singular
value decomposition to obtain latent representations, which are then clustered
using hierarchical clustering to segment semantically meaningful regions. The
number of clusters is adaptively determined by the distribution of singular
values. In the second stage, the segmented regions are localized and encoded
into image embeddings using the Vision Transformer backbone of CLIP. Text
embeddings are precomputed using CLIP's text encoder from category-specific
prompts, including a generic something else prompt to support open set
recognition. The image and text embeddings are concatenated and projected into
a shared latent feature space via SVD to enhance cross-modal alignment.
Recognition is performed by computing the softmax over the similarities between
the projected image and text embeddings. The proposed method is evaluated on
standard benchmarks, including COCO, ADE20K, and PASCAL VOC, achieving
state-of-the-art performance in terms of Hungarian mIoU, precision, recall, and
F1-score. These results demonstrate the effectiveness, flexibility, and
generalizability of the proposed framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型作为移动手机代理的基础，在处理多个移动任务时效果有限。现有多任务监督微调方法难以确定最优训练数据组合以获得最佳性能。

Method: DaMo使用可训练网络预测任何给定数据集比例下的下游任务性能，从而确定最优数据混合配置。同时引入了PhoneAgentBench基准，包含1235个QA对，涵盖多样化的现实工业移动应用场景。

Result: DaMo在PhoneAgentBench上相比其他方法实现了3.38%的性能提升，在多个基准测试中平均得分超过其他方法2.57%。在BFCL-v3任务上单独优化MLLM时，指标提升了12.47%。

Conclusion: DaMo展示了强大的预测能力和泛化性能，能够有效扩展到其他模型架构，为移动手机代理的多任务学习提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Mobile Phone Agents (MPAs) have emerged as a promising research direction due
to their broad applicability across diverse scenarios. While Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) serve as the foundation for MPAs, their effectiveness
in handling multiple mobile phone tasks simultaneously remains limited.
Although multitask supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is widely adopted for multitask
learning, existing approaches struggle to determine optimal training data
compositions for peak performance. To address this challenge, we propose DaMo
(Data Mixture Optimizer) - a novel solution employing a trainable network that
predicts optimal data mixtures by forecasting downstream task performance for
any given dataset ratio. To support comprehensive evaluation, we introduce
PhoneAgentBench, the first specialized benchmark to evaluate MLLMs on
multimodal mobile phone tasks, comprising 1235 QA pairs spanning diverse
real-world industrial mobile application scenarios. Demonstrating strong
predictive capability (R^2=0.81) in small-scale pilot experiments, DaMo
efficiently extrapolates optimal data mixing configurations. Our results show
DaMo achieves a 3.38% performance improvement on PhoneAgentBench compared to
alternative methods. Furthermore, extensive experiments across established
benchmarks including BFCL-v3, MME-Reasoning, MME-Perception, and OCRBench
reveal DaMo's superior generalization, outperforming other approaches by 2.57%
in terms of average score. When used solely for MLLM optimization on the
BFCL-v3 task, DaMo improves the metrics by 12.47% than other methods. Notably,
DaMo maintains robust scalability, preserving its effectiveness when applied to
other model architectures. The code and dataset are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DARE是一个可变形医学图像配准框架，通过动态调整弹性正则化来平衡稳定性和灵活性，同时包含防止折叠的机制来提高配准精度和解剖合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习方法在医学图像配准中往往忽视正则化的重要性，导致缺乏鲁棒性和解剖合理性。需要一种能够动态调整正则化并防止非物理伪影的方法。

Method: 提出DARE框架，基于变形场梯度范数动态调整弹性正则化，整合应变和剪切能量项，并包含防止折叠的惩罚机制来避免负变形雅可比行列式。

Result: 该方法能够减轻非物理伪影如折叠，避免过度平滑，同时提高配准精度和解剖合理性。

Conclusion: DARE通过自适应正则化和折叠预防机制，在医学图像配准中实现了更好的稳定性和解剖合理性平衡。

Abstract: Deformable medical image registration is a fundamental task in medical image
analysis. While deep learning-based methods have demonstrated superior accuracy
and computational efficiency compared to traditional techniques, they often
overlook the critical role of regularization in ensuring robustness and
anatomical plausibility. We propose DARE (Deformable Adaptive Regularization
Estimator), a novel registration framework that dynamically adjusts elastic
regularization based on the gradient norm of the deformation field. Our
approach integrates strain and shear energy terms, which are adaptively
modulated to balance stability and flexibility. To ensure physically realistic
transformations, DARE includes a folding-prevention mechanism that penalizes
regions with negative deformation Jacobian. This strategy mitigates
non-physical artifacts such as folding, avoids over-smoothing, and improves
both registration accuracy and anatomical plausibility

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AegisRF是一个保护NeRF模型知识产权的框架，通过注入对抗性扰动来破坏未经授权的下游应用，同时保持渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着NeRF成为3D场景表示和视图合成的强大工具，保护其知识产权免受未经授权使用变得至关重要。

Method: 提出AegisRF框架，包含扰动场和敏感度场。扰动场向NeRF预渲染输出注入对抗性扰动，敏感度场学习空间变化的几何扰动敏感度以约束扰动幅度。

Result: 实验表明AegisRF在多种下游任务和模态中具有通用适用性，包括多视图图像分类和基于体素的3D定位，同时保持高视觉保真度。

Conclusion: AegisRF有效保护NeRF模型知识产权，在破坏未经授权使用的同时维持渲染质量，为NeRF模型提供了实用的IP保护解决方案。

Abstract: As Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a powerful tool for 3D
scene representation and novel view synthesis, protecting their intellectual
property (IP) from unauthorized use is becoming increasingly crucial. In this
work, we aim to protect the IP of NeRFs by injecting adversarial perturbations
that disrupt their unauthorized applications. However, perturbing the 3D
geometry of NeRFs can easily deform the underlying scene structure and thus
substantially degrade the rendering quality, which has led existing attempts to
avoid geometric perturbations or restrict them to explicit spaces like meshes.
To overcome this limitation, we introduce a learnable sensitivity to quantify
the spatially varying impact of geometric perturbations on rendering quality.
Building upon this, we propose AegisRF, a novel framework that consists of a
Perturbation Field, which injects adversarial perturbations into the
pre-rendering outputs (color and volume density) of NeRF models to fool an
unauthorized downstream target model, and a Sensitivity Field, which learns the
sensitivity to adaptively constrain geometric perturbations, preserving
rendering quality while disrupting unauthorized use. Our experimental
evaluations demonstrate the generalized applicability of AegisRF across diverse
downstream tasks and modalities, including multi-view image classification and
voxel-based 3D localization, while maintaining high visual fidelity. Codes are
available at https://github.com/wkim97/AegisRF.

TL;DR: MV-RoboBench是一个专门评估视觉语言模型在多视角机器人操作中空间推理能力的基准测试，包含1.7k个手动整理的QA项目，涵盖8个子任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLM评估主要关注单视角设置，而多摄像头配置在机器人平台中日益普及，但VLM是否能有效利用多视角输入进行机器人推理仍是一个开放问题。

Method: 构建MV-RoboBench基准，包含空间理解和机器人执行两个主要类别，评估了包括开源和闭源模型在内的多种VLM，并采用CoT启发技术增强版本。

Result: 最先进模型的性能远低于人类水平，揭示了VLM在多视角机器人感知中面临的重大挑战。空间智能与机器人任务执行在多视角场景中呈正相关，但现有通用单视角空间理解基准的强性能并不能可靠转化为机器人空间任务的成功。

Conclusion: MV-RoboBench作为一个开放资源发布，旨在促进空间基础VLM和VLA的发展，不仅提供数据，还提供标准化的多视角具身推理评估协议。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are essential to Embodied AI, enabling robots
to perceive, reason, and act in complex environments. They also serve as the
foundation for the recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Yet most
evaluations of VLMs focus on single-view settings, leaving their ability to
integrate multi-view information underexplored. At the same time, multi-camera
setups are increasingly standard in robotic platforms, as they provide
complementary perspectives to mitigate occlusion and depth ambiguity. Whether
VLMs can effectively leverage such multi-view inputs for robotic reasoning
therefore remains an open question. To bridge this gap, we introduce
MV-RoboBench, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the multi-view
spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs in robotic manipulation. MV-RoboBench
consists of 1.7k manually curated QA items across eight subtasks, divided into
two primary categories: spatial understanding and robotic execution. We
evaluate a diverse set of existing VLMs, including both open-source and
closed-source models, along with enhanced versions incorporating CoT-inspired
techniques. The results show that state-of-the-art models remain far below
human performance, underscoring the substantial challenges VLMs face in
multi-view robotic perception. Additionally, our analysis uncovers two key
findings: (i) spatial intelligence and robotic task execution are positively
correlated in multi-view robotic scenarios; and (ii) strong performance on
existing general-purpose single-view spatial understanding benchmarks does not
reliably translate to success in the robotic spatial tasks assessed by our
benchmark. We release MV-RoboBench as an open resource to foster progress in
spatially grounded VLMs and VLAs, providing not only data but also a
standardized evaluation protocol for multi-view embodied reasoning.

Abstract: With the spread of e-commerce, the logistics market is growing around the
world. Therefore, improving the efficiency of warehouse operations is
essential. To achieve this, various approaches have been explored, and among
them, the use of digital twins is gaining attention. To make this approach
possible, it is necessary to accurately collect the positions of workers in a
warehouse and reflect them in a virtual space. However, a single camera has
limitations in its field of view, therefore sensing with multiple cameras is
necessary. In this study, we explored a method to track workers using 19
wide-angle cameras installed on the ceiling, looking down at the floor of the
logistics warehouse. To understand the relationship between the camera
coordinates and the actual positions in the warehouse, we performed alignment
based on the floor surface. However, due to the characteristics of wide-angle
cameras, significant distortion occurs at the edges of the image, particularly
in the vertical direction. To address this, the detected worker positions from
each camera were aligned based on foot positions, reducing the effects of image
distortion, and enabling accurate position alignment across cameras. As a
result, we confirmed an improvement of over 20% in tracking accuracy.
Furthermore, we compared multiple methods for utilizing appearance features and
validated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional
performance across various objective multimodal perception tasks, yet their
application to subjective, emotionally nuanced domains, such as psychological
analysis, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce PICK, a
multi-step framework designed for Psychoanalytical Image Comprehension through
hierarchical analysis and Knowledge injection with MLLMs, specifically focusing
on the House-Tree-Person (HTP) Test, a widely used psychological assessment in
clinical practice. First, we decompose drawings containing multiple instances
into semantically meaningful sub-drawings, constructing a hierarchical
representation that captures spatial structure and content across three levels:
single-object level, multi-object level, and whole level. Next, we analyze
these sub-drawings at each level with a targeted focus, extracting
psychological or emotional insights from their visual cues. We also introduce
an HTP knowledge base and design a feature extraction module, trained with
reinforcement learning, to generate a psychological profile for single-object
level analysis. This profile captures both holistic stylistic features and
dynamic object-specific features (such as those of the house, tree, or person),
correlating them with psychological states. Finally, we integrate these
multi-faceted information to produce a well-informed assessment that aligns
with expert-level reasoning. Our approach bridges the gap between MLLMs and
specialized expert domains, offering a structured and interpretable framework
for understanding human mental states through visual expression. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed PICK significantly enhances the
capability of MLLMs in psychological analysis. It is further validated as a
general framework through extensions to emotion understanding tasks.

applying these approaches to real-world IC defect classification tasks remains
challenging. This difficulty stems from two primary factors. First, real-world
conditions, such as the high yield-rate requirements in the IC industry, result
in data distributions that are far more skewed than those found in general
public imbalanced datasets. Consequently, classifiers designed for open
imbalanced datasets often fail to perform effectively in real-world scenarios.
Second, real-world samples exhibit a mix of class-specific attributes and
class-agnostic, domain-related features. This complexity adds significant
difficulty to the classification process, particularly for highly imbalanced
datasets. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the IC-Defect-14
dataset, a large, highly imbalanced IC defect image dataset sourced from AOI
systems deployed in real-world IC production lines. This dataset is
characterized by its unique "intra-class clusters" property, which presents two
major challenges: large intra-class diversity and high inter-class similarity.
These characteristics, rarely found simultaneously in existing public datasets,
significantly degrade the performance of current state-of-the-art classifiers
for highly imbalanced data. To tackle this challenge, we propose ReCAME-Net,
which follows a multi-expert classifier framework and integrates a regional
channel attention module, metric learning losses, a hard category mining
strategy, and a knowledge distillation procedure. Extensive experimental
evaluations demonstrate that ReCAME-Net outperforms previous state-of-the-art
models on the IC-Defect-14 dataset while maintaining comparable performance and
competitiveness on general public datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个多条件生成对抗网络框架，用于生成具有精确控制孔隙度属性的代表性孔隙尺度图像，解决了地下表征中的代表性和数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决地下岩石表征中获取真正代表性孔隙尺度图像的根本挑战，因为自然空间异质性导致提取的子图像与岩心测量值显著偏离，且物理样本仅在稀疏井位可用。

Method: 使用多条件生成对抗网络框架，在碳酸盐岩地层的四个深度薄片样本上训练，同时以孔隙度值和深度参数为条件，捕捉通用孔隙网络原理和深度特定地质特征。

Result: 模型在所有地层中实现了优异的孔隙度控制（R^2=0.95），平均绝对误差为0.0099-0.0197，生成图像的代表性误差为1.9-11.3%，远优于随机提取真实子图像的36.4-578%。

Conclusion: 该能力为地下表征提供了变革性工具，特别适用于碳储存、地热能源和地下水管理应用，其中了解孔隙空间的代表性形态对于实施数字岩石物理至关重要。

Abstract: Obtaining truly representative pore-scale images that match bulk formation
properties remains a fundamental challenge in subsurface characterization, as
natural spatial heterogeneity causes extracted sub-images to deviate
significantly from core-measured values. This challenge is compounded by data
scarcity, where physical samples are only available at sparse well locations.
This study presents a multi-conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN)
framework that generates representative pore-scale images with precisely
controlled properties, addressing both the representativeness challenge and
data availability constraints. The framework was trained on thin section
samples from four depths (1879.50-1943.50 m) of a carbonate formation,
simultaneously conditioning on porosity values and depth parameters within a
single unified model. This approach captures both universal pore network
principles and depth-specific geological characteristics, from grainstone
fabrics with interparticle-intercrystalline porosity to crystalline textures
with anhydrite inclusions. The model achieved exceptional porosity control
(R^2=0.95) across all formations with mean absolute errors of 0.0099-0.0197.
Morphological validation confirmed preservation of critical pore network
characteristics including average pore radius, specific surface area, and
tortuosity, with statistical differences remaining within acceptable geological
tolerances. Most significantly, generated images demonstrated superior
representativeness with dual-constraint errors of 1.9-11.3% compared to
36.4-578% for randomly extracted real sub-images. This capability provides
transformative tools for subsurface characterization, particularly valuable for
carbon storage, geothermal energy, and groundwater management applications
where knowing the representative morphology of the pore space is critical for
implementing digital rock physics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的MRI加速范式，从图像重建转向预测性成像，通过生成模型预测目标对比度图像作为数据驱动先验，显著提高高倍加速下的重建质量。


<details>

Motivation: 解决MRI采集时间过长限制临床吞吐量的问题，利用AI生成能力将传统图像重建转变为主动预测成像。

Method: 使用生成模型基于多种数据源（其他对比度图像、历史扫描图像、采集参数、患者信息）预测目标对比度图像，将其作为数据驱动先验用于高度欠采样数据的重建。

Result: 在内部和多个公共数据集（总计14,921次扫描；1,051,904个切片）上评估，包括多通道k空间数据，在高加速因子（x4、x8和x12）下，该方法显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了从图像重建到预测性成像的根本性转变，为MRI加速提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have created transformative
capabilities in image synthesis and generation, enabling diverse research
fields to innovate at revolutionary speed and spectrum. In this study, we
leverage this generative power to introduce a new paradigm for accelerating
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), introducing a shift from image reconstruction
to proactive predictive imaging. Despite being a cornerstone of modern patient
care, MRI's lengthy acquisition times limit clinical throughput. Our novel
framework addresses this challenge by first predicting a target contrast image,
which then serves as a data-driven prior for reconstructing highly
under-sampled data. This informative prior is predicted by a generative model
conditioned on diverse data sources, such as other contrast images, previously
scanned images, acquisition parameters, patient information. We demonstrate
this approach with two key applications: (1) reconstructing FLAIR images using
predictions from T1w and/or T2w scans, and (2) reconstructing T1w images using
predictions from previously acquired T1w scans. The framework was evaluated on
internal and multiple public datasets (total 14,921 scans; 1,051,904 slices),
including multi-channel k-space data, for a range of high acceleration factors
(x4, x8 and x12). The results demonstrate that our prediction-prior
reconstruction method significantly outperforms other approaches, including
those with alternative or no prior information. Through this framework we
introduce a fundamental shift from image reconstruction towards a new paradigm
of predictive imaging.

<details>

Motivation: 现有视频方法仅处理单个序列，未能利用跨序列的结构规律性和重复运动模式，导致深度模糊问题未能充分利用先验知识。

Method: 提出模式重用图卷积网络(PRGCN)，包含图记忆库存储姿态原型，通过注意力机制动态检索，结合Mamba状态空间模型和自注意力的双流架构。

Result: 在Human3.6M和MPI-INF-3DHP基准测试中分别达到37.1mm和13.4mm的MPJPE，建立了新的最先进水平，并展现出增强的跨域泛化能力。

Conclusion: 跨序列模式重用机制对推动该领域发展至关重要，将范式从每序列优化转向累积知识学习。

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a fundamentally ill-posed inverse
problem due to the inherent depth ambiguity in 2D-to-3D lifting. While
contemporary video-based methods leverage temporal context to enhance spatial
reasoning, they operate under a critical paradigm limitation: processing each
sequence in isolation, thereby failing to exploit the strong structural
regularities and repetitive motion patterns that pervade human movement across
sequences. This work introduces the Pattern Reuse Graph Convolutional Network
(PRGCN), a novel framework that formalizes pose estimation as a problem of
pattern retrieval and adaptation. At its core, PRGCN features a graph memory
bank that learns and stores a compact set of pose prototypes, encoded as
relational graphs, which are dynamically retrieved via an attention mechanism
to provide structured priors. These priors are adaptively fused with hard-coded
anatomical constraints through a memory-driven graph convolution, ensuring
geometrical plausibility. To underpin this retrieval process with robust
spatiotemporal features, we design a dual-stream hybrid architecture that
synergistically combines the linear-complexity, local temporal modeling of
Mamba-based state-space models with the global relational capacity of
self-attention. Extensive evaluations on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP benchmarks
demonstrate that PRGCN establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving an MPJPE
of 37.1mm and 13.4mm, respectively, while exhibiting enhanced cross-domain
generalization capability. Our work posits that the long-overlooked mechanism
of cross-sequence pattern reuse is pivotal to advancing the field, shifting the
paradigm from per-sequence optimization towards cumulative knowledge learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了卫星图像中系统性缺失像素导致的表示偏差问题，提出通过插补和加权重采样方法消除甲烷羽流检测中标签与图像覆盖率之间的虚假关联，从而减少模型偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星图像中由于云层等因素导致的系统性缺失像素（非随机缺失数据）会导致自动化特征提取模型出现表示偏差。研究发现甲烷羽流检测中标签与缺失值数量之间的虚假关联会使模型将图像覆盖率与标签关联，导致在低覆盖率图像中检测不足。

Method: 评估了多种插补方法以消除覆盖率与标签之间的依赖关系，并提出在训练期间使用加权重采样方案，通过在每个覆盖率区间内强制执行类别平衡来消除标签与覆盖率之间的关联。

Result: 结果显示重采样和插补都能显著减少表示偏差，同时不会损害平衡准确率、精确率或召回率。在操作场景中评估表明，使用这些技术的去偏模型在低覆盖率图像中检测羽流的几率更高。

Conclusion: 通过插补和重采样方法可以有效解决卫星图像中系统性缺失像素导致的表示偏差问题，提高模型在低覆盖率图像中的检测性能，为实际应用提供了有效的去偏解决方案。

Abstract: Most satellite images have systematically missing pixels (i.e., missing data
not at random (MNAR)) due to factors such as clouds. If not addressed, these
missing pixels can lead to representation bias in automated feature extraction
models. In this work, we show that spurious association between the label and
the number of missing values in methane plume detection can cause the model to
associate the coverage (i.e., the percentage of valid pixels in an image) with
the label, subsequently under-detecting plumes in low-coverage images. We
evaluate multiple imputation approaches to remove the dependence between the
coverage and a label. Additionally, we propose a weighted resampling scheme
during training that removes the association between the label and the coverage
by enforcing class balance in each coverage bin. Our results show that both
resampling and imputation can significantly reduce the representation bias
without hurting balanced accuracy, precision, or recall. Finally, we evaluate
the capability of the debiased models using these techniques in an operational
scenario and demonstrate that the debiased models have a higher chance of
detecting plumes in low-coverage images.

Motivation: 当前单源域泛化目标检测方法通过数据增强缓解域差异，但模型容易陷入伪相关陷阱，过度依赖简单分类特征而非本质的域不变表示。

Method: 提出Cauvis方法：1）交叉注意力提示模块，通过视觉提示与交叉注意力结合减轻伪特征偏差；2）双分支适配器，通过高频特征提取实现域适应并分离因果-伪特征。

Result: 在SDGOD数据集上相比现有域泛化方法提升15.9-31.4%，在复杂干扰环境中表现出显著鲁棒性优势。

Conclusion: Cauvis方法有效解决了单源域泛化目标检测中的伪相关问题，通过因果视觉提示实现了更好的域泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Single-source Domain Generalized Object Detection (SDGOD), as a cutting-edge
research topic in computer vision, aims to enhance model generalization
capability in unseen target domains through single-source domain training.
Current mainstream approaches attempt to mitigate domain discrepancies via data
augmentation techniques. However, due to domain shift and limited
domain-specific knowledge, models tend to fall into the pitfall of spurious
correlations. This manifests as the model's over-reliance on simplistic
classification features (e.g., color) rather than essential domain-invariant
representations like object contours. To address this critical challenge, we
propose the Cauvis (Causal Visual Prompts) method. First, we introduce a
Cross-Attention Prompts module that mitigates bias from spurious features by
integrating visual prompts with cross-attention. To address the inadequate
domain knowledge coverage and spurious feature entanglement in visual prompts
for single-domain generalization, we propose a dual-branch adapter that
disentangles causal-spurious features while achieving domain adaptation via
high-frequency feature extraction. Cauvis achieves state-of-the-art performance
with 15.9-31.4% gains over existing domain generalization methods on SDGOD
datasets, while exhibiting significant robustness advantages in complex
interference environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型通常以原生或高分辨率处理图像，导致97-99%的token都是视觉token，造成高计算成本和延迟，即使低分辨率图像已足够完成任务。

Method: 使用紧凑VLM（350M）提取特征并预测目标预训练VLM回答正确性达到峰值所需的最小分辨率。训练为离散分类器，推理时可插值连续分辨率进行细粒度控制。

Result: 在五个多模态基准测试（文档和自然图像）以及多种目标VLM上，CARES保持任务性能的同时将计算量减少高达80%。

Conclusion: CARES通过智能分辨率选择有效解决了VLM中视觉token过多导致的计算效率问题，实现了性能与效率的良好平衡。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) commonly process images at native or high
resolution to remain effective across tasks. This inflates visual tokens ofter
to 97-99% of total tokens, resulting in high compute and latency, even when
low-resolution images would suffice. We introduce \emph{CARES}-a
\textbf{C}ontext-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{R}esolution \textbf{S}elector, a
lightweight preprocessing module that, given an image-query pair, predicts the
\emph{minimal} sufficient input resolution. CARES uses a compact VLM (350M) to
extract features and predict when a target pretrained VLM's response converges
to its peak ability to answer correctly. Though trained as a discrete
classifier over a set of optional resolutions, CARES interpolates continuous
resolutions at inference for fine-grained control. Across five multimodal
benchmarks spanning documents and natural images, as well as diverse target
VLMs, CARES preserves task performance while reducing compute by up to 80%.

Conclusion: 该方法特别适用于重叠度小或无重叠的图像对，有效解决了稀疏重叠图像对姿态估计的挑战

Abstract: Pairwise camera pose estimation from sparsely overlapping image pairs remains
a critical and unsolved challenge in 3D vision. Most existing methods struggle
with image pairs that have small or no overlap. Recent approaches attempt to
address this by synthesizing intermediate frames using video interpolation and
selecting key frames via a self-consistency score. However, the generated
frames are often blurry due to small overlap inputs, and the selection
strategies are slow and not explicitly aligned with pose estimation. To solve
these cases, we propose Hybrid Video Generation (HVG) to synthesize clearer
intermediate frames by coupling a video interpolation model with a
pose-conditioned novel view synthesis model, where we also propose a Feature
Matching Selector (FMS) based on feature correspondence to select intermediate
frames appropriate for pose estimation from the synthesized results. Extensive
experiments on Cambridge Landmarks, ScanNet, DL3DV-10K, and NAVI demonstrate
that, compared to existing SOTA methods, PoseCrafter can obviously enhance the
pose estimation performances, especially on examples with small or no overlap.

Method: 在受控实验条件下研究了7个最先进视觉语言模型的计数能力，进行了层级分析，并针对性地仅微调输出层进行训练。

Result: 实验表明视觉语言模型对物体数量、类型、空间排列和干扰物高度敏感。层级分析显示错误源于最后一层表示到输出空间的映射问题。仅微调输出层可将准确率提升高达21%，并在真实数据集上获得一致改进。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型的计数失败主要源于输出映射问题，通过针对性的输出层微调可显著提升性能，这为改进模型推理能力提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently gained attention due to their
competitive performance on multiple downstream tasks, achieved by following
user-input instructions. However, VLMs still exhibit several limitations in
visual reasoning, such as difficulties in identifying relations (e.g., spatial,
temporal, and among objects), understanding temporal sequences (e.g., frames),
and counting objects. In this work, we go beyond score-level benchmark
evaluations of VLMs by investigating the underlying causes of their failures
and proposing a targeted approach to improve their reasoning capabilities. We
study the reasoning skills of seven state-of-the-art VLMs in the counting task
under controlled experimental conditions. Our experiments show that VLMs are
highly sensitive to the number and type of objects, their spatial arrangement,
and the co-occurrence of distractors. A layer-wise analysis reveals that errors
are due to incorrect mapping of the last-layer representation into the output
space. Our targeted training shows that fine-tuning just the output layer
improves accuracy by up to 21%. We corroborate these findings by achieving
consistent improvements on real-world datasets.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models offer great potential for creating virtually
limitless synthetic data, a valuable resource compared to fixed and finite real
datasets. Previous works evaluate the utility of synthetic data from T2I models
on three key desiderata: quality, diversity, and consistency. While prompt
engineering is the primary means of interacting with T2I models, the systematic
impact of prompt complexity on these critical utility axes remains
underexplored. In this paper, we first conduct synthetic experiments to
motivate the difficulty of generalization w.r.t. prompt complexity and explain
the observed difficulty with theoretical derivations. Then, we introduce a new
evaluation framework that can compare the utility of real data and synthetic
data, and present a comprehensive analysis of how prompt complexity influences
the utility of synthetic data generated by commonly used T2I models. We conduct
our study across diverse datasets, including CC12M, ImageNet-1k, and DCI, and
evaluate different inference-time intervention methods. Our synthetic
experiments show that generalizing to more general conditions is harder than
the other way round, since the former needs an estimated likelihood that is not
learned by diffusion models. Our large-scale empirical experiments reveal that
increasing prompt complexity results in lower conditional diversity and prompt
consistency, while reducing the synthetic-to-real distribution shift, which
aligns with the synthetic experiments. Moreover, current inference-time
interventions can augment the diversity of the generations at the expense of
moving outside the support of real data. Among those interventions, prompt
expansion, by deliberately using a pre-trained language model as a likelihood
estimator, consistently achieves the highest performance in both image
diversity and aesthetics, even higher than that of real data.

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have gained popularity
for their generalizable and expressive multimodal representations. By
leveraging large-scale training data with diverse textual metadata, VLMs
acquire open-vocabulary capabilities, solving tasks beyond their training
scope. This paper investigates the temporal awareness of VLMs, assessing their
ability to position visual content in time. We introduce TIME10k, a benchmark
dataset of over 10,000 images with temporal ground truth, and evaluate the
time-awareness of 37 VLMs by a novel methodology. Our investigation reveals
that temporal information is structured along a low-dimensional, non-linear
manifold in the VLM embedding space. Based on this insight, we propose methods
to derive an explicit ``timeline'' representation from the embedding space.
These representations model time and its chronological progression and thereby
facilitate temporal reasoning tasks. Our timeline approaches achieve
competitive to superior accuracy compared to a prompt-based baseline while
being computationally efficient. All code and data are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB相机和事件相机具有互补优势，但存在显著的时空不对称性阻碍了有效的多模态融合。

Method: 提出分层非对称蒸馏(HAD)框架，采用分层对齐策略，在保持学生网络计算效率和参数紧凑性的同时最小化信息损失。

Result: 在广泛实验中，HAD始终优于最先进方法，消融研究验证了各设计组件的有效性和必要性。

Conclusion: HAD成功解决了多模态融合中的时空不对称问题，为挑战性条件下的目标跟踪提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: RGB cameras excel at capturing rich texture details with high spatial
resolution, whereas event cameras offer exceptional temporal resolution and a
high dynamic range (HDR). Leveraging their complementary strengths can
substantially enhance object tracking under challenging conditions, such as
high-speed motion, HDR environments, and dynamic background interference.
However, a significant spatio-temporal asymmetry exists between these two
modalities due to their fundamentally different imaging mechanisms, hindering
effective multi-modal integration. To address this issue, we propose
{Hierarchical Asymmetric Distillation} (HAD), a multi-modal knowledge
distillation framework that explicitly models and mitigates spatio-temporal
asymmetries. Specifically, HAD proposes a hierarchical alignment strategy that
minimizes information loss while maintaining the student network's
computational efficiency and parameter compactness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that HAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and
comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness and necessity
of each designed component. The code will be released soon.

Motivation: 随着目标检测模型在自动驾驶汽车和监控平台等网络物理系统中的广泛应用，确保其对抗性威胁的安全性至关重要。现有研究主要关注图像域的对抗攻击，而视频域的攻击，特别是在无盒设置下的攻击，尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 利用RGBA视频的alpha通道将恶意目标视频与良性视频融合，设计融合算法确保视觉隐蔽性和兼容性，无需访问模型架构、参数或输出。

Result: 在五种最先进的目标检测器、一个视觉语言模型和一个多模态大语言模型（Gemini-2.0-Flash）上评估，在所有场景中实现了100%的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了视频感知系统中先前未被探索的漏洞，强调了在对抗性设置中考虑alpha通道的防御措施的紧迫需求。

Abstract: As object detection models are increasingly deployed in cyber-physical
systems such as autonomous vehicles (AVs) and surveillance platforms, ensuring
their security against adversarial threats is essential. While prior work has
explored adversarial attacks in the image domain, those attacks in the video
domain remain largely unexamined, especially in the no-box setting. In this
paper, we present {\alpha}-Cloak, the first no-box adversarial attack on object
detectors that operates entirely through the alpha channel of RGBA videos.
{\alpha}-Cloak exploits the alpha channel to fuse a malicious target video with
a benign video, resulting in a fused video that appears innocuous to human
viewers but consistently fools object detectors. Our attack requires no access
to model architecture, parameters, or outputs, and introduces no perceptible
artifacts. We systematically study the support for alpha channels across common
video formats and playback applications, and design a fusion algorithm that
ensures visual stealth and compatibility. We evaluate {\alpha}-Cloak on five
state-of-the-art object detectors, a vision-language model, and a multi-modal
large language model (Gemini-2.0-Flash), demonstrating a 100% attack success
rate across all scenarios. Our findings reveal a previously unexplored
vulnerability in video-based perception systems, highlighting the urgent need
for defenses that account for the alpha channel in adversarial settings.

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上的实验表明，该方法在各种设置下在客观指标和主观质量上都显著优于最先进方法，验证了VGD的可扩展性和高保真环视重建能力。

Conclusion: VGD通过显式几何学习和特征一致性优化，成功解决了环视自动驾驶场景重建中的几何一致性和新视角质量问题，实现了高质量的泛化重建。

Abstract: Feed-forward surround-view autonomous driving scene reconstruction offers
fast, generalizable inference ability, which faces the core challenge of
ensuring generalization while elevating novel view quality. Due to the
surround-view with minimal overlap regions, existing methods typically fail to
ensure geometric consistency and reconstruction quality for novel views. To
tackle this tension, we claim that geometric information must be learned
explicitly, and the resulting features should be leveraged to guide the
elevating of semantic quality in novel views. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{Visual Gaussian Driving (VGD)}, a novel feed-forward end-to-end
learning framework designed to address this challenge. To achieve generalizable
geometric estimation, we design a lightweight variant of the VGGT architecture
to efficiently distill its geometric priors from the pre-trained VGGT to the
geometry branch. Furthermore, we design a Gaussian Head that fuses multi-scale
geometry tokens to predict Gaussian parameters for novel view rendering, which
shares the same patch backbone as the geometry branch. Finally, we integrate
multi-scale features from both geometry and Gaussian head branches to jointly
supervise a semantic refinement model, optimizing rendering quality through
feature-consistent learning. Experiments on nuScenes demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both objective
metrics and subjective quality under various settings, which validates VGD's
scalability and high-fidelity surround-view reconstruction.

Method: 结合对比学习和模态判别学习，引导单模态模型将内部模型流形结构化为模态共享和模态特定信息，实现跨任务泛化而不针对特定推理模态。

Abstract: Multi-modal co-learning is emerging as an effective paradigm in machine
learning, enabling models to collaboratively learn from different modalities to
enhance single-modality predictions. Earth Observation (EO) represents a
quintessential domain for multi-modal data analysis, wherein diverse remote
sensors collect data to sense our planet. This unprecedented volume of data
introduces novel challenges. Specifically, the access to the same sensor
modalities at both training and inference stages becomes increasingly complex
based on real-world constraints affecting remote sensing platforms. In this
context, multi-modal co-learning presents a promising strategy to leverage the
vast amount of sensor-derived data available at the training stage to improve
single-modality models for inference-time deployment. Most current research
efforts focus on designing customized solutions for either particular
downstream tasks or specific modalities available at the inference stage. To
address this, we propose a novel multi-modal co-learning framework capable of
generalizing across various tasks without targeting a specific modality for
inference. Our approach combines contrastive and modality discriminative
learning together to guide single-modality models to structure the internal
model manifold into modality-shared and modality-specific information. We
evaluate our framework on four EO benchmarks spanning classification and
regression tasks across different sensor modalities, where only one of the
modalities available during training is accessible at inference time. Our
results demonstrate consistent predictive improvements over state-of-the-art
approaches from the recent machine learning and computer vision literature, as
well as EO-specific methods. The obtained findings validate our framework in
the single-modality inference scenarios across a diverse range of EO
applications.

Abstract: Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) addresses the depth-of-field (DOF)
limitations of optical lenses, where only objects within a specific range
appear sharp. Although traditional and deep learning methods have advanced the
field, challenges persist, including limited training data, domain gaps from
synthetic datasets, and difficulties with regions lacking information. We
propose VAEEDOF, a novel MFIF method that uses a distilled variational
autoencoder for high-fidelity, efficient image reconstruction. Our fusion
module processes up to seven images simultaneously, enabling robust fusion
across diverse focus points. To address data scarcity, we introduce
MattingMFIF, a new syntetic 4K dataset, simulating realistic DOF effects from
real photographs. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results, generating
seamless artifact-free fused images and bridging the gap between synthetic and
real-world scenarios, offering a significant step forward in addressing complex
MFIF challenges. The code, and weights are available here:

Abstract: This paper investigates methods for estimating uncertainty in semantic
segmentation predictions derived from satellite imagery. Estimating uncertainty
for segmentation presents unique challenges compared to standard image
classification, requiring scalable methods producing per-pixel estimates. While
most research on this topic has focused on scene understanding or medical
imaging, this work benchmarks existing methods specifically for remote sensing
and Earth observation applications. Our evaluation focuses on the practical
utility of uncertainty measures, testing their ability to identify prediction
errors and noise-corrupted input image regions. Experiments are conducted on
two remote sensing datasets, PASTIS and ForTy, selected for their differences
in scale, geographic coverage, and label confidence. We perform an extensive
evaluation featuring several models, such as Stochastic Segmentation Networks
and ensembles, in combination with a number of neural architectures and
uncertainty metrics. We make a number of practical recommendations based on our

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DecAF方法，通过分解注意力融合机制将MLLM的注意力图直接转换为分割掩码，无需训练即可实现视频推理分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视频理解方面表现强大，但其原始注意力图噪声大且与物体区域对齐不佳，需要一种无需训练的方法来改进注意力图用于分割任务。

Method: 使用Decomposed Attention Fusion方法，包含对比性物体-背景融合和互补视频帧融合两个机制，抑制无关激活并增强物体焦点线索，结合注意力引导的SAM2提示获得精细掩码。

Result: DecAF在引用和推理视频对象分割基准上优于无训练方法，性能接近基于训练的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了无需重新训练MLLM即可有效利用其注意力机制进行视频分割的可行性，为训练免费的视频理解分割提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong video
understanding by attending to visual tokens relevant to textual queries. To
directly adapt this for localization in a training-free manner, we cast video
reasoning segmentation as a video QA task and extract attention maps via
rollout mechanism. However, raw attention maps are noisy and poorly aligned
with object regions. We propose Decomposed Attention Fusion (DecAF), which
refines these maps through two mechanisms: (1) contrastive object-background
fusion and (2) complementary video-frame fusion. This method suppresses
irrelevant activations and enhances object-focused cues, enabling direct
conversion of attention maps into coarse segmentation masks. In addition, we
introduce attention-guided SAM2 prompting for obtaining fine-grained masks.
Unlike existing methods that jointly train MLLMs with SAM, our method operates
entirely without retraining. DecAF outperforms training-free methods and
achieves performance comparable to training-based methods on both referring and
reasoning VOS benchmarks. The code will be available at

TL;DR: 提出CBDiff模型，通过生成多个多样化的伪造定位图来增强图像伪造定位的可信度，采用伯努利噪声和时序交叉注意力机制，在多个基准数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像伪造定位方法通常生成单一确定性定位图，缺乏高精度和可靠性，无法满足法医分析和安全监控等高风险应用的需求。

Method: 引入条件伯努利扩散模型(CBDiff)，生成多个多样化的伪造定位图；在扩散过程中加入伯努利噪声以更好地反映伪造掩码的二元稀疏特性；设计时序交叉注意力机制(TSCAttention)利用语义特征和时间步长改进篡改检测。

Result: 在8个公开基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，CBDiff显著优于现有最先进方法，显示出在实际部署中的强大潜力。

Conclusion: CBDiff通过生成多个可信的伪造定位图有效解决了篡改区域的不确定性和变异性问题，为图像伪造定位提供了更可靠和全面的解决方案。

Abstract: Image Forgery Localization (IFL) is a crucial task in image forensics, aimed
at accurately identifying manipulated or tampered regions within an image at
the pixel level. Existing methods typically generate a single deterministic
localization map, which often lacks the precision and reliability required for
high-stakes applications such as forensic analysis and security surveillance.
To enhance the credibility of predictions and mitigate the risk of errors, we
introduce an advanced Conditional Bernoulli Diffusion Model (CBDiff). Given a
forged image, CBDiff generates multiple diverse and plausible localization
maps, thereby offering a richer and more comprehensive representation of the
forgery distribution. This approach addresses the uncertainty and variability
inherent in tampered regions. Furthermore, CBDiff innovatively incorporates
Bernoulli noise into the diffusion process to more faithfully reflect the
inherent binary and sparse properties of forgery masks. Additionally, CBDiff
introduces a Time-Step Cross-Attention (TSCAttention), which is specifically
designed to leverage semantic feature guidance with temporal steps to improve
manipulation detection. Extensive experiments on eight publicly benchmark
datasets demonstrate that CBDiff significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its strong potential for real-world
deployment.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个系统性基准XBench，用于评估胸片X光中视觉语言模型的跨模态可解释性，发现当前模型在临床可靠定位方面仍有不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在医学图像理解中表现出色，但其定位能力（文本概念与视觉证据的对齐程度）尚未充分探索，而在医学领域可靠的定位对于可解释性和临床采用至关重要。

Method: 使用交叉注意力和基于相似性的定位图生成视觉解释，并定量评估其与放射科医生标注区域在多种病理上的对齐程度，测试了7种CLIP风格的VLM变体。

Result: 发现：(1)所有VLM变体对大型明确病理定位合理，但对小型或弥散病变性能显著下降；(2)在胸片特定数据集预训练的模型比对通用数据训练的模型对齐性更好；(3)模型整体识别能力与定位能力强相关。

Conclusion: 当前VLM尽管识别能力强，但在临床可靠定位方面仍有不足，强调了在医学实践中部署前需要有针对性的可解释性基准测试。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently shown remarkable zero-shot
performance in medical image understanding, yet their grounding ability, the
extent to which textual concepts align with visual evidence, remains
underexplored. In the medical domain, however, reliable grounding is essential
for interpretability and clinical adoption. In this work, we present the first
systematic benchmark for evaluating cross-modal interpretability in chest
X-rays across seven CLIP-style VLM variants. We generate visual explanations
using cross-attention and similarity-based localization maps, and
quantitatively assess their alignment with radiologist-annotated regions across
multiple pathologies. Our analysis reveals that: (1) while all VLM variants
demonstrate reasonable localization for large and well-defined pathologies,
their performance substantially degrades for small or diffuse lesions; (2)
models that are pretrained on chest X-ray-specific datasets exhibit improved
alignment compared to those trained on general-domain data. (3) The overall
recognition ability and grounding ability of the model are strongly correlated.
These findings underscore that current VLMs, despite their strong recognition
ability, still fall short in clinically reliable grounding, highlighting the
need for targeted interpretability benchmarks before deployment in medical
practice. XBench code is available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于散射系数的去噪估计器，通过联合最小化和最大化不同散射系数子集的ℓ¹范数来抑制高斯噪声，达到了卡通图像在所有Lipschitz指数α≤2下的极小极大渐近界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的稀疏估计器（如小波、曲波等）在适应复杂信号规律性方面不够丰富，特别是对于边缘为分段C^α曲线的卡通图像，当Lipschitz指数α≤2是未知参数时，这些方法不是最优的。深度卷积神经网络虽然取得了更好的数值结果，但需要更简洁的理论模型。

Method: 引入散射系数作为简化的卷积神经网络模型，通过第二次小波变换计算小波系数模值。提出去噪估计器，通过联合最小化和最大化不同散射系数子集的ℓ¹范数来实现去噪。

Result: 数值实验表明，该去噪估计器对于卡通图像在所有Lipschitz指数α≤2下都能达到极小极大渐近界。证明了这些ℓ¹范数能够捕捉不同类型的几何图像规律性。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了不同的调和分析方法来抑制信号噪声并指定函数的几何规律性，在调和分析与深度卷积网络去噪估计器之间建立了数学桥梁。

Abstract: A considerable amount of research in harmonic analysis has been devoted to
non-linear estimators of signals contaminated by additive Gaussian noise. They
are implemented by thresholding coefficients in a frame, which provide a sparse
signal representation, or by minimising their $\ell^1$ norm. However, sparse
estimators in frames are not sufficiently rich to adapt to complex signal
regularities. For cartoon images whose edges are piecewise $\bf C^\alpha$
curves, wavelet, curvelet and Xlet frames are suboptimal if the Lipschitz
exponent $\alpha \leq 2$ is an unknown parameter. Deep convolutional neural
networks have recently obtained much better numerical results, which reach the
minimax asymptotic bounds for all $\alpha$. Wavelet scattering coefficients
have been introduced as simplified convolutional neural network models. They
are computed by transforming the modulus of wavelet coefficients with a second
wavelet transform. We introduce a denoising estimator by jointly minimising and
maximising the $\ell^1$ norms of different subsets of scattering coefficients.
We prove that these $\ell^1$ norms capture different types of geometric image
regularity. Numerical experiments show that this denoising estimator reaches
the minimax asymptotic bound for cartoon images for all Lipschitz exponents
$\alpha \leq 2$. We state this numerical result as a mathematical conjecture.
It provides a different harmonic analysis approach to suppress noise from
signals, and to specify the geometric regularity of functions. It also opens a
mathematical bridge between harmonic analysis and denoising estimators with
deep convolutional network.

Motivation: 现实应用中，异构智能体在传感器和模型上的差异导致协作时存在领域差距。现有基于适应和重构的方法存在两个关键限制：(1) 编码器或核心模块的侵入式重训练破坏了智能体间已建立的语义一致性；(2) 容纳新智能体计算成本高，限制了可扩展性。

Result: 在OPV2V-H、DAIR-V2X和V2X-Real数据集上的实验表明，GenComm优于现有最先进方法，在集成新智能体时实现了81%的计算成本和参数数量减少。

Conclusion: GenComm通过生成式通信机制有效解决了异构多智能体协作中的领域差距问题，实现了高效、可扩展的感知协作。

Abstract: Multi-agent collaboration enhances the perception capabilities of individual
agents through information sharing. However, in real-world applications,
differences in sensors and models across heterogeneous agents inevitably lead
to domain gaps during collaboration. Existing approaches based on adaptation
and reconstruction fail to support pragmatic heterogeneous collaboration due to
two key limitations: (1) Intrusive retraining of the encoder or core modules
disrupts the established semantic consistency among agents; and (2)
accommodating new agents incurs high computational costs, limiting scalability.
To address these challenges, we present a novel Generative Communication
mechanism (GenComm) that facilitates seamless perception across heterogeneous
multi-agent systems through feature generation, without altering the original
network, and employs lightweight numerical alignment of spatial information to
efficiently integrate new agents at minimal cost. Specifically, a tailored
Deformable Message Extractor is designed to extract spatial message for each
collaborator, which is then transmitted in place of intermediate features. The
Spatial-Aware Feature Generator, utilizing a conditional diffusion model,
generates features aligned with the ego agent's semantic space while preserving
the spatial information of the collaborators. These generated features are
further refined by a Channel Enhancer before fusion. Experiments conducted on
the OPV2V-H, DAIR-V2X and V2X-Real datasets demonstrate that GenComm
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an 81\% reduction in
both computational cost and parameter count when incorporating new agents. Our
code is available at https://github.com/jeffreychou777/GenComm.

Motivation: 解决现有时刻检索方法面临的三个关键瓶颈：(1)数据稀缺导致模型陷入浅层关键词特征关联；(2)相邻事件间边界模糊；(3)细粒度语义区分不足

Method: 提出AMR框架，包含两阶段训练：冷启动阶段使用课程学习在增强数据上建立基础边界/语义感知；蒸馏阶段引入双查询集（原始查询和主动查询），通过跨阶段蒸馏损失保持知识一致性

Result: 在多个基准测试中，AMR相比先前最先进方法实现了性能提升

Conclusion: AMR框架有效克服了数据标注不足导致的局部最优问题，增强了边界和语义区分能力，在真实场景中具有更好的泛化性能

Abstract: Existing Moment Retrieval methods face three critical bottlenecks: (1) data
scarcity forces models into shallow keyword-feature associations; (2) boundary
ambiguity in transition regions between adjacent events; (3) insufficient
discrimination of fine-grained semantics (e.g., distinguishing ``kicking" vs.
``throwing" a ball). In this paper, we propose a zero-external-dependency
Augmented Moment Retrieval framework, AMR, designed to overcome local optima
caused by insufficient data annotations and the lack of robust boundary and
semantic discrimination capabilities. AMR is built upon two key insights: (1)
it resolves ambiguous boundary information and semantic confusion in existing
annotations without additional data (avoiding costly manual labeling), and (2)
it preserves boundary and semantic discriminative capabilities enhanced by
training while generalizing to real-world scenarios, significantly improving
performance. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training framework with
cold-start and distillation adaptation. The cold-start stage employs curriculum
learning on augmented data to build foundational boundary/semantic awareness.
The distillation stage introduces dual query sets: Original Queries maintain
DETR-based localization using frozen Base Queries from the cold-start model,
while Active Queries dynamically adapt to real-data distributions. A
cross-stage distillation loss enforces consistency between Original and Base
Queries, preventing knowledge forgetting while enabling real-world
generalization. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that AMR achieves
improved performance over prior state-of-the-art approaches.

Motivation: 通用视觉语言模型在医学领域表现不佳，主要由于缺乏高质量医学影像数据集和忽略了从粗到细的诊断过程。

Method: 构建CT-RATE-VQA数据集（84K QA对），提出MedReason-R1模型，嵌入放大病灶区域，并引入GRPO强化学习框架。

Result: MedReason-R1在CT疾病诊断中达到最先进性能，同时保持泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式推理过程和强化学习，显著提升了医学视觉语言模型的诊断性能。

Abstract: General-purpose large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong
capabilities in generating detailed descriptions for natural images. However,
their performance in the medical domain remains suboptimal, even for relatively
straightforward tasks, primarily due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality,
specialized medical imaging datasets and the neglect of the diagnostic process
that progresses from coarse to fine-grained. To address the first issue, we
construct the CT-RATE-VQA dataset, which has 84K QA pairs. For the second
issue, we propose MedReason-R1, a medical VLM with explicit reasoning process
for disease diagnosis. MedReason-R1 incorporates a novel strategy that embeds
zoom-in disease region-of-interest areas into the image, highlighting the
crucial role of both global localization and disease-specific details in
enhancing the model's diagnostic performance. Furthermore, we introduce the
GRPO reinforcement learning framework to MedReason-R1, which enables effective
reasoning without relying on costly manual annotations. Compared to recent
general-purpose and medical VLMs, MedReason-R1 achieves state-of-the-art
performance in CT disease diagnosis while retaining generalization. The code,

TL;DR: ReAct-GS通过重要性感知的致密化准则和重新激活机制，解决了3D高斯泼溅中的过重建伪影问题，在保持几何细节的同时提升了新视角合成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅在复杂场景中会出现过重建伪影，表现为局部模糊和针状扭曲。现有方法归因于大规模高斯分布分割不足，但本文发现两个根本限制：致密化过程中的梯度幅度稀释和基元冻结现象。

Method: 提出ReAct-GS方法，包含：(1)重要性感知致密化准则，结合多视角的α混合权重来重新激活复杂区域中停滞的基元生长；(2)重新激活机制，通过自适应参数扰动来激活冻结的基元。

Result: 在多个真实世界数据集上的综合实验表明，ReAct-GS有效消除了过重建伪影，在新视角合成标准指标上达到最先进性能，同时保持了精细的几何细节。

Conclusion: ReAct-GS成功解决了3D高斯泼溅中的过重建问题，其重新激活机制在与其他3D-GS变体（如Pixel-GS）集成时也带来了一致的改进，展示了广泛的适用性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) achieves real-time photorealistic novel view
synthesis, yet struggles with complex scenes due to over-reconstruction
artifacts, manifesting as local blurring and needle-shape distortions. While
recent approaches attribute these issues to insufficient splitting of
large-scale Gaussians, we identify two fundamental limitations: gradient
magnitude dilution during densification and the primitive frozen phenomenon,
where essential Gaussian densification is inhibited in complex regions while
suboptimally scaled Gaussians become trapped in local optima. To address these
challenges, we introduce ReAct-GS, a method founded on the principle of
re-activation. Our approach features: (1) an importance-aware densification
criterion incorporating $\alpha$-blending weights from multiple viewpoints to
re-activate stalled primitive growth in complex regions, and (2) a
re-activation mechanism that revitalizes frozen primitives through adaptive
parameter perturbations. Comprehensive experiments across diverse real-world
datasets demonstrate that ReAct-GS effectively eliminates over-reconstruction
artifacts and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard novel view
synthesis metrics while preserving intricate geometric details. Additionally,
our re-activation mechanism yields consistent improvements when integrated with
other 3D-GS variants such as Pixel-GS, demonstrating its broad applicability.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on
vision-language tasks, yet their visual processing is opaque. Most black-box
evaluations measure task accuracy, but reveal little about underlying
mechanisms. Drawing on cognitive psychology, we adapt classic visual search
paradigms -- originally developed to study human perception -- to test whether
MLLMs exhibit the ``pop-out'' effect, where salient visual features are
detected independently of distractor set size. Using controlled experiments
targeting colour, size and lighting features, we find that advanced MLLMs
exhibit human-like pop-out effects in colour or size-based disjunctive (single
feature) search, as well as capacity limits for conjunctive (multiple feature)
search. We also find evidence to suggest that MLLMs, like humans, incorporate
natural scene priors such as lighting direction into object representations. We
reinforce our findings using targeted fine-tuning and mechanistic
interpretability analyses. Our work shows how visual search can serve as a
cognitively grounded diagnostic tool for evaluating perceptual capabilities in
MLLMs.

*Zihao Chen,Yi Zhou,Xudong Jiang,Li Chen,Leopold Schmetterer,Bingyao Tan,Jun Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CST框架，在无配对图像翻译中保持细长曲线结构，通过结构提取模块提供拓扑监督，可集成到现有方法中提升翻译保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无配对图像翻译方法在医学成像中会扭曲细长曲线结构（如微血管），影响诊断可靠性和定量分析，这在眼科和血管成像中尤为重要。

Method: CST框架通过集成结构提取模块提供拓扑监督，可无缝集成到CycleGAN和UNSB等现有方法中，保持曲线结构一致性。

Result: 在光学相干断层扫描血管成像、彩色眼底和X射线冠状动脉造影三种成像模态上的评估显示，CST提高了翻译保真度并达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: CST通过强化学习映射中的几何完整性，为医学成像中的曲线结构感知跨域翻译建立了原则性途径。

Abstract: Unpaired image-to-image translation has emerged as a crucial technique in
medical imaging, enabling cross-modality synthesis, domain adaptation, and data
augmentation without costly paired datasets. Yet, existing approaches often
distort fine curvilinear structures, such as microvasculature, undermining both
diagnostic reliability and quantitative analysis. This limitation is
consequential in ophthalmic and vascular imaging, where subtle morphological
changes carry significant clinical meaning. We propose Curvilinear
Structure-preserving Translation (CST), a general framework that explicitly
preserves fine curvilinear structures during unpaired translation by
integrating structure consistency into the training. Specifically, CST augments
baseline models with a curvilinear extraction module for topological
supervision. It can be seamlessly incorporated into existing methods. We
integrate it into CycleGAN and UNSB as two representative backbones.
Comprehensive evaluation across three imaging modalities: optical coherence
tomography angiography, color fundus and X-ray coronary angiography
demonstrates that CST improves translation fidelity and achieves
state-of-the-art performance. By reinforcing geometric integrity in learned
mappings, CST establishes a principled pathway toward curvilinear
structure-aware cross-domain translation in medical imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Ensemble-CAM的新技术，为基于深度学习的面部呈现攻击检测系统提供视觉解释，以提高系统的透明度和可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习呈现攻击检测系统多为黑盒模型，决策过程不透明，需要解释性技术来理解模型行为，特别是视觉解释对于确定生物特征图像被判定为真实或伪造的关键区域至关重要。

Method: 提出Ensemble-CAM技术，为基于深度学习的面部呈现攻击检测系统生成视觉解释，通过突出显示影响模型决策的关键图像区域来增强模型透明度。

Result: 通过提供视觉解释，能够更好地理解深度学习面部呈现攻击检测系统的决策过程，识别出导致图像被判定为真实或伪造的关键区域。

Conclusion: Ensemble-CAM技术能够显著提升基于深度学习的面部呈现攻击检测系统的透明度和可信度，为理解模型行为提供了有效的可视化手段。

Abstract: Presentation attacks represent a critical security threat where adversaries
use fake biometric data, such as face, fingerprint, or iris images, to gain
unauthorized access to protected systems. Various presentation attack detection
(PAD) systems have been designed leveraging deep learning (DL) models to
mitigate this type of threat. Despite their effectiveness, most of the DL
models function as black boxes - their decisions are opaque to their users. The
purpose of explainability techniques is to provide detailed information about
the reason behind the behavior or decision of DL models. In particular, visual
explanation is necessary to better understand the decisions or predictions of
DL-based PAD systems and determine the key regions due to which a biometric
image is considered real or fake by the system. In this work, a novel
technique, Ensemble-CAM, is proposed for providing visual explanations for the
decisions made by deep learning-based face PAD systems. Our goal is to improve
DL-based face PAD systems by providing a better understanding of their
behavior. Our provided visual explanations will enhance the transparency and
trustworthiness of DL-based face PAD systems.

*Kuai Yu,Crystal Su,Xiang Liu,Judah Goldfeder,Mingyuan Shao,Hod Lipson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LyTimeT是一个两阶段框架，通过时空注意力机制和稳定性约束从高维视频中提取可解释的动态系统变量，有效抑制视觉干扰因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从高维视频中提取真实动态变量面临背景运动、遮挡和纹理变化等视觉干扰因素的挑战，需要开发能够学习鲁棒且稳定潜在表示的方法。

Method: 第一阶段使用时序变换器自编码器通过全局注意力聚焦动态相关区域；第二阶段通过线性相关分析选择物理意义维度，并使用李雅普诺夫稳定性正则化器优化转移动态。

Result: 在五个合成基准和四个真实世界动态系统上的实验表明，LyTimeT在互信息和内在维度估计上最接近真实值，对背景扰动保持不变性，并在CNN和变换器基线中实现最低的分析均方误差。

Conclusion: 结合时空注意力和稳定性约束可以产生不仅准确而且物理可解释的预测模型。

Abstract: Extracting the true dynamical variables of a system from high-dimensional
video is challenging due to distracting visual factors such as background
motion, occlusions, and texture changes. We propose LyTimeT, a two-phase
framework for interpretable variable extraction that learns robust and stable
latent representations of dynamical systems. In Phase 1, LyTimeT employs a
spatio-temporal TimeSformer-based autoencoder that uses global attention to
focus on dynamically relevant regions while suppressing nuisance variation,
enabling distraction-robust latent state learning and accurate long-horizon
video prediction. In Phase 2, we probe the learned latent space, select the
most physically meaningful dimensions using linear correlation analysis, and
refine the transition dynamics with a Lyapunov-based stability regularizer to
enforce contraction and reduce error accumulation during roll-outs. Experiments
on five synthetic benchmarks and four real-world dynamical systems, including
chaotic phenomena, show that LyTimeT achieves mutual information and intrinsic
dimension estimates closest to ground truth, remains invariant under background
perturbations, and delivers the lowest analytical mean squared error among
CNN-based (TIDE) and transformer-only baselines. Our results demonstrate that
combining spatio-temporal attention with stability constraints yields
predictive models that are not only accurate but also physically interpretable.

TL;DR: 提出ADQ自适应分布感知量化框架，解决激活值分布不均匀和权重量化码本不匹配问题，在ImageNet上ResNet-18仅用2.81比特平均位宽达到71.512%准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有量化感知训练方法面临两个主要挑战：激活值分布高度不均匀，以及权重量化中使用的静态、不匹配的码本

Method: 采用混合精度量化框架，核心是自适应权重量化方案：1)基于分位数的码本初始化；2)基于指数移动平均的在线码本适应机制；3)基于敏感度的混合精度分配策略。对于激活值，集成硬件友好的非均匀到均匀映射方案

Result: 在ImageNet上，ADQ使ResNet-18仅用2.81比特平均位宽达到71.512% Top-1准确率，优于同类条件下的最先进方法。在CIFAR-10上的消融研究系统验证了各创新组件的贡献

Conclusion: ADQ框架通过自适应分布感知量化有效解决了量化中的分布不均匀和码本不匹配问题，在极低位宽下仍能保持高精度

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) is a critical technique for deploying deep
neural networks on resource-constrained devices. However, existing methods
often face two major challenges: the highly non-uniform distribution of
activations and the static, mismatched codebooks used in weight quantization.
To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Distribution-aware
Quantization (ADQ), a mixed-precision quantization framework that employs a
differentiated strategy. The core of ADQ is a novel adaptive weight
quantization scheme comprising three key innovations: (1) a quantile-based
initialization method that constructs a codebook closely aligned with the
initial weight distribution; (2) an online codebook adaptation mechanism based
on Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to dynamically track distributional shifts;
and (3) a sensitivity-informed strategy for mixed-precision allocation. For
activations, we integrate a hardware-friendly non-uniform-to-uniform mapping
scheme. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method. On
ImageNet, ADQ enables a ResNet-18 to achieve 71.512% Top-1 accuracy with an
average bit-width of only 2.81 bits, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
under comparable conditions. Furthermore, detailed ablation studies on CIFAR-10
systematically demonstrate the individual contributions of each innovative
component, validating the rationale and effectiveness of our design.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniMotion-X是一个多模态人体运动生成框架，使用自回归扩散变换器统一处理文本到运动、音乐到舞蹈、语音到手势等多种任务，并支持时空控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以统一处理多样化的多模态运动生成任务，且缺乏对生成内容一致性和时空动态的控制能力。

Method: 提出使用参考运动作为条件信号，采用渐进式弱到强混合条件训练策略处理多模态冲突，并构建了最大的统一多模态运动数据集OmniMoCap-X。

Result: 实验证明OmniMotion-X在多个多模态任务上显著超越现有方法，实现了最先进的性能，能够生成真实、连贯且可控的长时运动。

Conclusion: OmniMotion-X提供了一个高效统一的多模态运动生成框架，通过创新的条件信号和训练策略解决了多模态冲突问题，为交互式运动生成开辟了新途径。

Abstract: This paper introduces OmniMotion-X, a versatile multimodal framework for
whole-body human motion generation, leveraging an autoregressive diffusion
transformer in a unified sequence-to-sequence manner. OmniMotion-X efficiently
supports diverse multimodal tasks, including text-to-motion, music-to-dance,
speech-to-gesture, and global spatial-temporal control scenarios (e.g., motion
prediction, in-betweening, completion, and joint/trajectory-guided synthesis),
as well as flexible combinations of these tasks. Specifically, we propose the
use of reference motion as a novel conditioning signal, substantially enhancing
the consistency of generated content, style, and temporal dynamics crucial for
realistic animations. To handle multimodal conflicts, we introduce a
progressive weak-to-strong mixed-condition training strategy. To enable
high-quality multimodal training, we construct OmniMoCap-X, the largest unified
multimodal motion dataset to date, integrating 28 publicly available MoCap
sources across 10 distinct tasks, standardized to the SMPL-X format at 30 fps.
To ensure detailed and consistent annotations, we render sequences into videos
and use GPT-4o to automatically generate structured and hierarchical captions,
capturing both low-level actions and high-level semantics. Extensive
experimental evaluations confirm that OmniMotion-X significantly surpasses
existing methods, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across multiple
multimodal tasks and enabling the interactive generation of realistic,
coherent, and controllable long-duration motions.

TL;DR: 提出了CPL-NC框架，通过类感知原型缓存和负对比学习机制，解决视觉语言模型在分布偏移下的测试时自适应问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在分布偏移时性能下降，现有测试时自适应方法忽略长尾分布中的原型退化和语义相似类间的混淆问题。

Method: 使用类感知原型缓存模块动态调整每类容量，结合负对比学习机制约束困难负样本，采用非对称优化仅更新文本原型。

Result: 在15个基准测试中，CPL-NC在ResNet-50和ViT-B/16骨干网络上均优于现有测试时自适应方法。

Conclusion: CPL-NC是轻量级测试时自适应框架，能有效提升视觉语言模型在分布偏移下的泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive zero-shot generalization
through large-scale image-text pretraining, yet their performance can drop once
the deployment distribution diverges from the training distribution. To address
this, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods update models using unlabeled target
data. However, existing approaches often ignore two key challenges: prototype
degradation in long-tailed distributions and confusion between semantically
similar classes. To tackle these issues, we propose \textbf{C}lass-Aware
\textbf{P}rototype \textbf{L}earning with \textbf{N}egative
\textbf{C}ontrast(\textbf{CPL-NC}), a lightweight TTA framework designed
specifically for VLMs to enhance generalization under distribution shifts.
CPL-NC introduces a \textit{Class-Aware Prototype Cache} Module that
dynamically adjusts per-class capacity based on test-time frequency and
activation history, with a rejuvenation mechanism for inactive classes to
retain rare-category knowledge. Additionally, a \textit{Negative Contrastive
Learning} Mechanism identifies and constrains hard visual-textual negatives to
improve class separability. The framework employs asymmetric optimization,
refining only textual prototypes while anchoring on stable visual features.
Experiments on 15 benchmarks show that CPL-NC consistently outperforms prior
TTA methods across both ResNet-50 and ViT-B/16 backbones.

Motivation: 当前多模态模型在文本引导图像编辑方面取得了显著进展，但研究社区的发展受到缺乏大规模、高质量、开放可访问的真实图像数据集的限制。

Method: 利用Nano-Banana从OpenImages集合中的真实照片生成多样化的编辑对，采用细粒度图像编辑分类法确保编辑类型的全面覆盖，通过基于MLLM的质量评分和精心策划来保持精确的内容保留和指令忠实度。

Result: 构建了包含40万张图像的Pico-Banana-400K数据集，包含三个专门子集：7.2万个多轮编辑示例用于顺序编辑研究，5.6万个偏好子集用于对齐研究，以及配对的短长编辑指令用于指令重写能力开发。

Conclusion: Pico-Banana-400K为训练和基准测试下一代文本引导图像编辑模型提供了强大基础，推动了复杂编辑场景的研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated remarkable text-guided
image editing capabilities, with systems like GPT-4o and Nano-Banana setting
new benchmarks. However, the research community's progress remains constrained
by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and openly accessible datasets
built from real images. We introduce Pico-Banana-400K, a comprehensive
400K-image dataset for instruction-based image editing. Our dataset is
constructed by leveraging Nano-Banana to generate diverse edit pairs from real
photographs in the OpenImages collection. What distinguishes Pico-Banana-400K
from previous synthetic datasets is our systematic approach to quality and
diversity. We employ a fine-grained image editing taxonomy to ensure
comprehensive coverage of edit types while maintaining precise content
preservation and instruction faithfulness through MLLM-based quality scoring
and careful curation. Beyond single turn editing, Pico-Banana-400K enables
research into complex editing scenarios. The dataset includes three specialized
subsets: (1) a 72K-example multi-turn collection for studying sequential
editing, reasoning, and planning across consecutive modifications; (2) a
56K-example preference subset for alignment research and reward model training;
and (3) paired long-short editing instructions for developing instruction
rewriting and summarization capabilities. By providing this large-scale,
high-quality, and task-rich resource, Pico-Banana-400K establishes a robust
foundation for training and benchmarking the next generation of text-guided
image editing models.

Motivation: 单目深度估计领域缺乏标准化的评估方法，现有评估指标的选择多样且其权衡和行为未被充分理解，需要定量分析这些指标对地面真实值扰动的敏感性，并与人类判断进行比较。

Method: 对现有评估指标进行定量分析，研究它们对各种地面真实值扰动的敏感性，特别关注与人类判断的比较。提出基于相对表面法线的新指标、新的深度可视化工具，以及构建与人类判断更一致的综合指标的合理方法。

Result: 分析显示现有指标对曲率扰动（如使平坦表面波浪化）严重不敏感。提出的新指标和工具能够更好地与人类判断对齐。

Conclusion: 单目深度估计的评估需要更敏感的指标，特别是对曲率变化。提出的基于相对表面法线的新指标和综合指标构建方法能够改善评估质量，使结果更符合人类感知。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation is an important task with rapid progress, but how
to evaluate it remains an open question, as evidenced by a lack of
standardization in existing literature and a large selection of evaluation
metrics whose trade-offs and behaviors are not well understood. This paper
contributes a novel, quantitative analysis of existing metrics in terms of
their sensitivity to various types of perturbations of ground truth,
emphasizing comparison to human judgment. Our analysis reveals that existing
metrics are severely under-sensitive to curvature perturbation such as making
flat surfaces wavy. To remedy this, we introduce a new metric based on relative
surface normals, along with new depth visualization tools and a principled
method to create composite metrics with better human alignment. Code and data

Abstract: We introduce ITTO, a challenging new benchmark suite for evaluating and

videos are sourced from existing datasets and egocentric real-world recordings,
with high-quality human annotations collected through a multi-stage pipeline.
ITTO captures the motion complexity, occlusion patterns, and object diversity
characteristic of real-world scenes -- factors that are largely absent in
current benchmarks. We conduct a rigorous analysis of state-of-the-art tracking
methods on ITTO, breaking down performance along key axes of motion complexity.
Our findings reveal that existing trackers struggle with these challenges,
particularly in re-identifying points after occlusion, highlighting critical
failure modes. These results point to the need for new modeling approaches
tailored to real-world dynamics. We envision ITTO as a foundation testbed for
advancing point tracking and guiding the development of more robust tracking

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一框架来分析测试时缩放中验证器的作用，将可验证的测试时缩放建模为传输问题，揭示了次优性-覆盖率曲线的三个机制，并分析了顺序和批量采样算法的计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然带有验证的测试时缩放显示出提升大语言模型性能的潜力，但验证器的作用及其缺陷仍未得到充分探索。现有研究只捕捉了这些因素的部分子集，缺乏量化它们相互作用几何结构的统一框架。

Method: 将可验证的测试时缩放框架化为传输问题，通过分析生成器的覆盖率、验证器的收敛区域和采样算法的次优性这三个量的相互作用来表征其几何特性。提出了顺序和批量两类采样算法并分析其计算复杂度。

Result: 理论分析发现次优性-覆盖率曲线呈现三个机制：传输机制（次优性随覆盖率增加）、策略改进机制（次优性可能随覆盖率减少，取决于验证器的收敛区域）和饱和机制（次优性趋于平稳，不受覆盖率影响）。使用Qwen、Llama和Gemma模型的实证结果验证了理论发现。

Conclusion: 通过将可验证的测试时缩放建模为传输问题，本文提供了一个统一框架来理解验证器在测试时缩放中的作用，揭示了覆盖率、验证器收敛区域和采样算法次优性之间的复杂相互作用，为设计更有效的测试时缩放方法提供了理论基础。

Abstract: While test-time scaling with verification has shown promise in improving the
performance of large language models (LLMs), the role of the verifier and its
imperfections remain underexplored. The effect of verification manifests
through interactions of three quantities: (i) the generator's coverage, (ii)
the verifier's region of convergence (ROC), and (iii) the sampling algorithm's
sub-optimality. Though recent studies capture subsets of these factors, a
unified framework quantifying the geometry of their interplay is missing. We
frame verifiable test-time scaling as a transport problem. This characterizes
the interaction of coverage, ROC, and sub-optimality, and uncovers that the
sub-optimality--coverage curve exhibits three regimes. A transport regime --
where sub-optimality increases with coverage, a policy improvement regime --
where sub-optimality may decrease with coverage, depending on the verifier's
ROC, and a saturation regime -- where sub-optimality plateaus, unaffected by
coverage. We further propose and analyze two classes of sampling algorithms --
sequential and batched, and examine how their computational complexities shape
these trade-offs. Empirical results with Qwen, Llama, and Gemma models
corroborate our theoretical findings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器学习诊断方法依赖静态数据集，无法反映临床实践中顺序性、资源感知的推理过程。诊断在高压或资源有限环境中仍然复杂且容易出错，需要能够帮助临床医生做出及时且成本效益高的决策的框架。

Method: ACTMED整合贝叶斯实验设计和大型语言模型，在每一步选择预期能最大程度减少诊断不确定性的测试。LLM作为灵活模拟器生成合理的患者状态分布，支持信念更新而无需结构化、特定任务的训练数据。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的评估显示，ACTMED能够优化测试选择，提高诊断准确性、可解释性和资源使用效率。

Conclusion: ACTMED代表了向透明、自适应且与临床医生对齐的诊断系统迈出的一步，能够在减少对领域特定数据依赖的情况下跨环境泛化。

Abstract: There is growing interest in using machine learning (ML) to support clinical
diag- nosis, but most approaches rely on static, fully observed datasets and
fail to reflect the sequential, resource-aware reasoning clinicians use in
practice. Diagnosis remains complex and error prone, especially in
high-pressure or resource-limited settings, underscoring the need for
frameworks that help clinicians make timely and cost-effective decisions. We
propose ACTMED (Adaptive Clinical Test selection via Model-based Experimental
Design), a diagnostic framework that integrates Bayesian Experimental Design
(BED) with large language models (LLMs) to better emulate real-world diagnostic
reasoning. At each step, ACTMED selects the test expected to yield the greatest
reduction in diagnostic uncertainty for a given patient. LLMs act as flexible
simulators, generating plausible patient state distributions and supporting
belief updates without requiring structured, task-specific training data.
Clinicians can remain in the loop; reviewing test suggestions, interpreting
intermediate outputs, and applying clinical judgment throughout. We evaluate
ACTMED on real-world datasets and show it can optimize test selection to
improve diagnostic accuracy, interpretability, and resource use. This
represents a step to- ward transparent, adaptive, and clinician-aligned
diagnostic systems that generalize across settings with reduced reliance on
domain-specific data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对多模态大语言模型音频理解能力的评估可能掩盖了其在关系推理方面的根本弱点，需要更深入的音乐感知技能评估工具。

Method: 开发了MUSE基准测试，包含10个任务来评估基础音乐感知技能，并对4个SOTA模型与200人的人类基线进行对比评估。

Result: 发现SOTA模型能力差异巨大，与人类专家存在持续差距。Gemini Pro在基础感知上表现良好，但Qwen和Audio Flamingo 3表现接近随机水平，思维链提示效果不一致且往往有害。

Conclusion: MUSE基准为评估不变音乐表征和开发更鲁棒的AI系统提供了关键工具。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated capabilities in
audio understanding, but current evaluations may obscure fundamental weaknesses
in relational reasoning. We introduce the Music Understanding and Structural
Evaluation (MUSE) Benchmark, an open-source resource with 10 tasks designed to
probe fundamental music perception skills. We evaluate four SOTA models (Gemini
Pro and Flash, Qwen2.5-Omni, and Audio-Flamingo 3) against a large human
baseline (N=200). Our results reveal a wide variance in SOTA capabilities and a
persistent gap with human experts. While Gemini Pro succeeds on basic
perception, Qwen and Audio Flamingo 3 perform at or near chance, exposing
severe perceptual deficits. Furthermore, we find Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting provides inconsistent, often detrimental results. Our work provides a
critical tool for evaluating invariant musical representations and driving
development of more robust AI systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出PRISM方法，通过学习群不变核来缓解基于偏好的奖励模型中的捷径行为问题，提高奖励模型在分布外任务上的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于人类反馈的强化学习中，偏好奖励模型容易受到奖励攻击和泛化能力差的问题，模型会利用训练数据中的虚假特征（如回答冗长、讨好语气等）来获取高分，而非真正反映人类意图。

Method: 受核视角不变性理论启发，提出PRISM方法，在闭式学习目标中学习具有特征映射的群不变核，以减轻偏好奖励学习中的捷径行为。

Conclusion: PRISM为基于偏好的对齐建立了一个稳健的框架，能有效缓解奖励模型中的捷径行为问题。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning from human feedback, preference-based reward models
play a central role in aligning large language models to human-aligned
behavior. However, recent studies show that these models are prone to reward
hacking and often fail to generalize well due to over-optimization. They
achieve high reward scores by exploiting shortcuts, that is, exploiting
spurious features (e.g., response verbosity, agreeable tone, or sycophancy)
that correlate with human preference labels in the training data rather than
genuinely reflecting the intended objectives. In this paper, instead of probing
these issues one at a time, we take a broader view of the reward hacking
problem as shortcut behaviors and introduce a principled yet flexible approach
to mitigate shortcut behaviors in preference-based reward learning. Inspired by
the invariant theory in the kernel perspective, we propose Preference-based
Reward Invariance for Shortcut Mitigation (PRISM), which learns group-invariant
kernels with feature maps in a closed-form learning objective. Experimental
results in several benchmarks show that our method consistently improves the
accuracy of the reward model on diverse out-of-distribution tasks and reduces
the dependency on shortcuts in downstream policy models, establishing a robust
framework for preference-based alignment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究评估了大型语言模型在根据CONSORT标准评估临床试验报告方面的能力，发现不同模型和提示条件在推理风格、不确定性表达和替代解释方面存在明显差异，揭示了当前系统在临床合规自动化中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在医疗领域迅速扩展，但这些系统根据CONSORT标准评估临床试验报告的能力尚不清楚，特别是在认知和推理策略方面。

Method: 采用行为和元认知分析方法，使用专家验证数据，系统比较了两个代表性大型语言模型在三种提示条件下的表现。

Result: 不同模型在处理各种CONSORT项目和提示类型时表现出明显差异，包括推理风格的转变、明确的不确定性表达和替代解释模式。

Conclusion: 结果强调了这些系统在当前临床合规自动化中的局限性，并突出了理解其认知适应和策略行为对于开发更可解释和可靠的医疗AI的重要性。

Abstract: Despite the rapid expansion of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare,
the ability of these systems to assess clinical trial reporting according to
CONSORT standards remains unclear, particularly with respect to their cognitive
and reasoning strategies. This study applies a behavioral and metacognitive
analytic approach with expert-validated data, systematically comparing two
representative LLMs under three prompt conditions. Clear differences emerged in
how the models approached various CONSORT items, and prompt types, including
shifts in reasoning style, explicit uncertainty, and alternative
interpretations shaped response patterns. Our results highlight the current
limitations of these systems in clinical compliance automation and underscore
the importance of understanding their cognitive adaptations and strategic
behavior in developing more explainable and reliable medical AI.

*Yuqiao Tan,Shizhu He,Kang Liu,Jun Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文研究了推理模型中的模式选择问题，将其识别为早期退出问题的更具挑战性变体，旨在通过零步思维在推理开始前决定使用长链思维还是短链思维模式，以减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理模型在数学和逻辑推理任务中表现出色，但逐步推理过程常导致过度思考，产生不必要的计算开销。为了解决这个问题，需要开发能够在推理过程开始前就自动选择合适推理模式的方法。

Method: 将模式选择识别为早期退出问题的变体，比较了九种基线方法，包括基于提示的方法和利用模型内部信息的方法，重点关注在零步思维（不进行显式推理过程）的情况下做出决策。

Result: 基于提示的方法由于分类能力有限而经常失败，而利用内部信息的方法在大多数场景中表现更好但仍存在稳定性问题。现有方法仅依赖模型提供的信息不足以有效解决信息有限场景下的模式选择问题。

Conclusion: 模式选择是一个具有挑战性的任务，现有方法在信息有限的情况下效果有限，凸显了该任务的持续挑战性。需要开发更有效的方法来解决零步思维下的模式选择问题。

Abstract: Reasoning models have demonstrated exceptional performance in tasks such as
mathematics and logical reasoning, primarily due to their ability to engage in
step-by-step thinking during the reasoning process. However, this often leads
to overthinking, resulting in unnecessary computational overhead. To address
this issue, Mode Selection aims to automatically decide between Long-CoT
(Chain-of-Thought) or Short-CoT by utilizing either a Thinking or NoThinking
mode. Simultaneously, Early Exit determines the optimal stopping point during
the iterative reasoning process. Both methods seek to reduce the computational
burden. In this paper, we first identify Mode Selection as a more challenging
variant of the Early Exit problem, as they share similar objectives but differ
in decision timing. While Early Exit focuses on determining the best stopping
point for concise reasoning at inference time, Mode Selection must make this
decision at the beginning of the reasoning process, relying on pre-defined fake
thoughts without engaging in an explicit reasoning process, referred to as
zero-step thinking. Through empirical studies on nine baselines, we observe
that prompt-based approaches often fail due to their limited classification
capabilities when provided with minimal hand-crafted information. In contrast,
approaches that leverage internal information generally perform better across
most scenarios but still exhibit issues with stability. Our findings indicate
that existing methods relying solely on the information provided by models are
insufficient for effectively addressing Mode Selection in scenarios with
limited information, highlighting the ongoing challenges of this task. Our code
is available at https://github.com/Trae1ounG/Zero_Step_Thinking.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个多智能体LLM模拟框架，通过行为奖励函数和情境学习来研究LLM智能体是否能重现人类在线社交动态，包括同质性、互惠性和社会验证等特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索大型语言模型智能体是否能复制人类在线行为的复杂社交动态，以及哪些记忆和学习机制能够促使这些动态出现。

Method: 设计了一个多智能体LLM模拟框架，智能体通过重复互动、相互评估和情境学习来适应行为，使用捕捉在线参与核心驱动因素的行为奖励函数，包括社交互动、信息寻求、自我呈现、协调和情感支持。

Result: 实验表明，经过指导的LLM智能体形成了稳定的互动模式和新兴的社交联系，产生的网络结构反映了真实在线社区的特性。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究LLM群体中的集体动态建立了一个原则性测试平台，揭示了人工智能智能体如何近似或偏离类人社交行为。

Abstract: Can large language model (LLM) agents reproduce the complex social dynamics
that characterize human online behavior -- shaped by homophily, reciprocity,
and social validation -- and what memory and learning mechanisms enable such
dynamics to emerge? We present a multi-agent LLM simulation framework in which
agents repeatedly interact, evaluate one another, and adapt their behavior
through in-context learning accelerated by a coaching signal. To model human
social behavior, we design behavioral reward functions that capture core
drivers of online engagement, including social interaction, information
seeking, self-presentation, coordination, and emotional support. These rewards
align agent objectives with empirically observed user motivations, enabling the
study of how network structures and group formations emerge from individual
decision-making. Our experiments show that coached LLM agents develop stable
interaction patterns and form emergent social ties, yielding network structures
that mirror properties of real online communities. By combining behavioral
rewards with in-context adaptation, our framework establishes a principled
testbed for investigating collective dynamics in LLM populations and reveals
how artificial agents may approximate or diverge from human-like social
behavior.

TL;DR: WebGraphEval是一个将多智能体轨迹抽象为统一加权动作图的框架，用于评估Web智能体，超越传统的二元成功指标，捕捉结构多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Web智能体评估主要依赖二元成功指标或单一参考轨迹，忽略了基准数据集中的结构多样性。

Method: 将多个智能体的轨迹抽象为统一的加权动作图，规范编码动作，合并重复行为，并应用结构分析包括奖励传播和成功加权边统计。

Result: 在来自六个Web智能体的数千条轨迹上的评估显示，图抽象捕捉了跨模型规律性，突出了冗余和低效，并识别了基于结果指标忽略的关键决策点。

Conclusion: 通过将Web交互框架化为图结构数据，WebGraphEval为Web智能体建立了多路径、跨智能体和效率感知评估的通用方法。

Abstract: Current evaluation of web agents largely reduces to binary success metrics or
conformity to a single reference trajectory, ignoring the structural diversity
present in benchmark datasets. We present WebGraphEval, a framework that
abstracts trajectories from multiple agents into a unified, weighted action
graph. This representation is directly compatible with benchmarks such as
WebArena, leveraging leaderboard runs and newly collected trajectories without
modifying environments. The framework canonically encodes actions, merges
recurring behaviors, and applies structural analyses including reward
propagation and success-weighted edge statistics. Evaluations across thousands
of trajectories from six web agents show that the graph abstraction captures
cross-model regularities, highlights redundancy and inefficiency, and
identifies critical decision points overlooked by outcome-based metrics. By
framing web interaction as graph-structured data, WebGraphEval establishes a
general methodology for multi-path, cross-agent, and efficiency-aware
evaluation of web agents.

### [84] [HSCodeComp: A Realistic and Expert-level Benchmark for Deep Search Agents in Hierarchical Rule Application](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19631)
*Yiqian Yang,Tian Lan,Qianghuai Jia,Li Zhu,Hui Jiang,Hang Zhu,Longyue Wang,Weihua Luo,Kaifu Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HSCodeComp是首个评估深度搜索代理在分层规则应用能力的电商基准，要求代理根据产品描述预测10位协调制度代码，现有最佳代理准确率仅46.8%，远低于人类专家的95.0%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代理基准忽视了深度搜索代理应用复杂规则（如法律条款、关税规则）的关键能力，这些规则具有模糊边界和隐含逻辑关系，对代理构成挑战。

Method: 从大型电商平台收集真实数据构建HSCodeComp基准，包含632个产品条目，涵盖多样化产品类别，HSCode由多位人类专家标注。

Result: 在多个最先进LLM、开源和闭源代理上的实验显示巨大性能差距：最佳代理仅达到46.8%的10位准确率，远低于人类专家的95.0%，测试时扩展也无法进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: HSCodeComp揭示了分层规则应用对深度搜索代理的挑战，现有代理在处理复杂规则方面仍有很大改进空间，需要更强大的推理能力。

Abstract: Effective deep search agents must not only access open-domain and
domain-specific knowledge but also apply complex rules-such as legal clauses,
medical manuals and tariff rules. These rules often feature vague boundaries
and implicit logic relationships, making precise application challenging for
agents. However, this critical capability is largely overlooked by current
agent benchmarks.
  To fill this gap, we introduce HSCodeComp, the first realistic, expert-level
e-commerce benchmark designed to evaluate deep search agents in hierarchical
rule application. In this task, the deep reasoning process of agents is guided
by these rules to predict 10-digit Harmonized System Code (HSCode) of products
with noisy but realistic descriptions. These codes, established by the World
Customs Organization, are vital for global supply chain efficiency. Built from
real-world data collected from large-scale e-commerce platforms, our proposed
HSCodeComp comprises 632 product entries spanning diverse product categories,
with these HSCodes annotated by several human experts.
  Extensive experimental results on several state-of-the-art LLMs, open-source,
and closed-source agents reveal a huge performance gap: best agent achieves
only 46.8% 10-digit accuracy, far below human experts at 95.0%. Besides,
detailed analysis demonstrates the challenges of hierarchical rule application,
and test-time scaling fails to improve performance further.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究通过法律领域的实验评估ChatGPT性能，与正则表达式基线对比，发现ChatGPT即使具备必要知识和能力，也无法整合推理得出全面结果，揭示了其在复杂问题分解和综合解决方面的重大局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估ChatGPT在法律领域的实际表现，特别是其整合知识和推理能力，而非仅与人类表现对比，以揭示人工智能在复杂专业任务中的真实局限性。

Method: 在法律领域进行实验，将ChatGPT与正则表达式(Regex)基线方法进行对比，测试其从法律判决中提取法律原则关键段落的能力。

Result: ChatGPT即使拥有必要的知识和能力，也无法有效整合和推理以产生全面结果，显示出在复杂问题分解和多能力协调方面的显著不足。

Conclusion: 真正的智能需要分解复杂问题并协调多种能力提供统一全面解决方案的能力，这在法律领域仍是人类独有的特质，人工智能目前存在根本性局限。

Abstract: This study examines the performance of ChatGPT with an experiment in the
legal domain. We compare the outcome with it a baseline using regular
expressions (Regex), rather than focusing solely on the assessment against
human performance. The study reveals that even if ChatGPT has access to the
necessary knowledge and competencies, it is unable to assemble them, reason
through, in a way that leads to an exhaustive result. This unveils a major
limitation of ChatGPT. Intelligence encompasses the ability to break down
complex issues and address them according to multiple required competencies,
providing a unified and comprehensive solution. In the legal domain, one of the
most crucial tasks is reading legal decisions and extracting key passages
condensed from principles of law (PoLs), which are then incorporated into
subsequent rulings by judges or defense documents by lawyers. In performing
this task, artificial intelligence lacks an all-encompassing understanding and
reasoning, which makes it inherently limited. Genuine intelligence, remains a
uniquely human trait, at least in this particular field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统先例推理假设先例集必须一致，但广义推理模型放松了这一假设。目前已有基于传统一致推理模型的论证解释方法，但缺乏针对广义推理框架的相应解释方法。

Method: 扩展推导状态论证框架(DSA-framework)，使其能够解释基于广义推理模型的推理过程。

Result: 开发了能够处理不一致先例的论证性解释框架。

Conclusion: 成功扩展了DSA框架，为广义推理模型提供了有效的论证解释方法，填补了该领域的研究空白。

Abstract: Precedential constraint is one foundation of case-based reasoning in AI and
Law. It generally assumes that the underlying set of precedents must be
consistent. To relax this assumption, a generalized notion of the reason model
has been introduced. While several argumentative explanation approaches exist
for reasoning with precedents based on the traditional consistent reason model,
there has been no corresponding argumentative explanation method developed for
this generalized reasoning framework accommodating inconsistent precedents. To
address this question, this paper examines an extension of the derivation state
argumentation framework (DSA-framework) to explain the reasoning according to
the generalized notion of the reason model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界环境通常是非平稳的，需要智能体持续适应新任务和变化条件。现有的持续强化学习方法存在灾难性遗忘和知识利用效率低的问题。

Method: 提出持续知识适应策略，维护任务特定知识向量池，动态使用历史知识来适应新任务。同时提出自适应知识合并机制，合并相似知识向量以减少内存需求。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，CKA-RL优于最先进方法，整体性能提升4.20%，前向迁移提升8.02%。

Conclusion: CKA-RL通过持续知识适应有效缓解了灾难性遗忘，实现了跨任务的高效知识迁移，在持续强化学习场景中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning enables agents to learn optimal behaviors through
interactions with environments. However, real-world environments are typically
non-stationary, requiring agents to continuously adapt to new tasks and
changing conditions. Although Continual Reinforcement Learning facilitates
learning across multiple tasks, existing methods often suffer from catastrophic
forgetting and inefficient knowledge utilization. To address these challenges,
we propose Continual Knowledge Adaptation for Reinforcement Learning (CKA-RL),
which enables the accumulation and effective utilization of historical
knowledge. Specifically, we introduce a Continual Knowledge Adaptation
strategy, which involves maintaining a task-specific knowledge vector pool and
dynamically using historical knowledge to adapt the agent to new tasks. This
process mitigates catastrophic forgetting and enables efficient knowledge
transfer across tasks by preserving and adapting critical model parameters.
Additionally, we propose an Adaptive Knowledge Merging mechanism that combines
similar knowledge vectors to address scalability challenges, reducing memory
requirements while ensuring the retention of essential knowledge. Experiments
on three benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed CKA-RL outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving an improvement of 4.20% in overall
performance and 8.02% in forward transfer. The source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试往往孤立评估工具，忽略了功能重叠和跨服务器编排等挑战，导致评估结果过于乐观。

Method: 采用五级课程结构，从单工具编排到复杂跨服务器规划，系统测试代理能力，并构建等函数集作为真实标签。

Result: 实验表明，僵化的层次结构会阻碍性能，即使最先进的代理在鲁棒性方面也存在系统性弱点。

Conclusion: MSC-Bench提供了一个诊断框架来暴露这些局限性，指导开发更强大和高效的工具使用代理。

Abstract: We introduce MSC-Bench, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating multi-hop,
end-to-end tool orchestration by LLM agents in a hierarchical Model-Context
Protocol (MCP) ecosystem. Existing benchmarks often evaluate tools in
isolation, ignoring challenges such as functional overlap and cross-server
orchestration, leading to overly optimistic assessments. MSC-Bench addresses
these gaps by constructing ground truth through 'equal function sets', allowing
objective metrics such as F1 score and reducing the dependency on
LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. Organized as a five-level curriculum, it
systematically tests agent capabilities from single-tool orchestration to
complex cross-server planning, and robustness to out-of-scope requests.
Experiments reveal that rigid hierarchies can hinder performance without
co-designed strategies, and even state-of-the-art agents exhibit systemic
weaknesses in robustness. MSC-Bench provides a diagnostic framework to expose
these limitations and guide the development of more capable and efficient
tool-using agents. The benchmark and resources are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在动态环境中采用语言模型进行具身任务时，由于延迟、连接性和资源限制而无法在线访问大规模推理引擎或符号规划器的问题。

Method: 首先使用符号工具生成任务特定计划，然后将这些计划转化为编码计划隐式产生规则的可组合过程表示，最后将这些过程无缝集成到语言模型的推理过程中。

Result: 在PDDLGym、VirtualHome和ALFWorld等具身基准测试中，NeSyPr展示了比大规模推理模型和符号规划器更高效的推理能力，同时使用更紧凑的语言模型。

Conclusion: 神经符号程序化能够将多步符号结构化路径查找和推理抽象并泛化为单步语言模型推理，支持无需外部符号指导的高效测试时推理，适合部署在延迟敏感和资源受限的物理系统中。

Abstract: We address the challenge of adopting language models (LMs) for embodied tasks
in dynamic environments, where online access to large-scale inference engines
or symbolic planners is constrained due to latency, connectivity, and resource
limitations. To this end, we present NeSyPr, a novel embodied reasoning
framework that compiles knowledge via neurosymbolic proceduralization, thereby
equipping LM-based agents with structured, adaptive, and timely reasoning
capabilities. In NeSyPr, task-specific plans are first explicitly generated by
a symbolic tool leveraging its declarative knowledge. These plans are then
transformed into composable procedural representations that encode the plans'
implicit production rules, enabling the resulting composed procedures to be
seamlessly integrated into the LM's inference process. This neurosymbolic
proceduralization abstracts and generalizes multi-step symbolic structured
path-finding and reasoning into single-step LM inference, akin to human
knowledge compilation. It supports efficient test-time inference without
relying on external symbolic guidance, making it well suited for deployment in
latency-sensitive and resource-constrained physical systems. We evaluate NeSyPr
on the embodied benchmarks PDDLGym, VirtualHome, and ALFWorld, demonstrating
its efficient reasoning capabilities over large-scale reasoning models and a
symbolic planner, while using more compact LMs.

Result: 在结构和视觉观察基准测试中，DAIL有效解决了指令模糊性问题，性能优于基线方法

Conclusion: DAIL通过分布对齐学习成功解决了语言指令的模糊性问题，提升了智能代理的语言理解和指令跟随能力

Abstract: Comprehending natural language and following human instructions are critical
capabilities for intelligent agents. However, the flexibility of linguistic
instructions induces substantial ambiguity across language-conditioned tasks,
severely degrading algorithmic performance. To address these limitations, we
present a novel method named DAIL (Distributional Aligned Learning), featuring
two key components: distributional policy and semantic alignment. Specifically,
we provide theoretical results that the value distribution estimation mechanism
enhances task differentiability. Meanwhile, the semantic alignment module
captures the correspondence between trajectories and linguistic instructions.
Extensive experimental results on both structured and visual observation
benchmarks demonstrate that DAIL effectively resolves instruction ambiguities,
achieving superior performance to baseline methods. Our implementation is

Abstract: Web-based participatory urban sensing has emerged as a vital approach for
modern urban management by leveraging mobile individuals as distributed
sensors. However, existing urban sensing systems struggle with limited
generalization across diverse urban scenarios and poor interpretability in
decision-making. In this work, we introduce AgentSense, a hybrid, training-free
framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) into participatory urban
sensing through a multi-agent evolution system. AgentSense initially employs
classical planner to generate baseline solutions and then iteratively refines
them to adapt sensing task assignments to dynamic urban conditions and
heterogeneous worker preferences, while producing natural language explanations
that enhance transparency and trust. Extensive experiments across two
large-scale mobility datasets and seven types of dynamic disturbances
demonstrate that AgentSense offers distinct advantages in adaptivity and
explainability over traditional methods. Furthermore, compared to single-agent
LLM baselines, our approach outperforms in both performance and robustness,
while delivering more reasonable and transparent explanations. These results
position AgentSense as a significant advancement towards deploying adaptive and
explainable urban sensing systems on the web.

Conclusion: 该图论引擎为吉他学生提供了有效的和弦音即兴演奏练习工具，解决了传统学习方法中的困难。

Abstract: We present a graph-based engine for computing chord tone soloing suggestions
for guitar students. Chord tone soloing is a fundamental practice for
improvising over a chord progression, where the instrumentalist uses only the
notes contained in the current chord. This practice is a building block for all
advanced jazz guitar theory but is difficult to learn and practice. First, we
discuss methods for generating chord-tone arpeggios. Next, we construct a
weighted graph where each node represents a chord tone arpeggio for a chord in
the progression. Then, we calculate the edge weight between each consecutive
chord's nodes in terms of optimal transition tones. We then find the shortest
path through this graph and reconstruct a chord-tone soloing line. Finally, we
discuss a user-friendly system to handle input and output to this engine for
guitar students to practice chord tone soloing.

Abstract: The increasing number of spectators and players in e-sports, along with the
development of optimized communication solutions and cloud computing
technology, has motivated the constant growth of the online game industry. Even
though Artificial Intelligence-based solutions for e-sports analytics are
traditionally defined as extracting meaningful patterns from related data and
visualizing them to enhance decision-making, most of the effort in professional
winning prediction has been focused on the classification aspect from a batch
perspective, also leaving aside the visualization techniques. Consequently,
this work contributes to an explainable win prediction classification solution
in streaming in which input data is controlled over several sliding windows to
reflect relevant game changes. Experimental results attained an accuracy higher
than 90 %, surpassing the performance of competing solutions in the literature.
Ultimately, our system can be leveraged by ranking and recommender systems for

Result: 使用学习权重的规则直接应用可获得优越性能，而将规则、权重和逻辑模型输出注入LLM反而会降低准确性。

Conclusion: LLM擅长语义生成和解释，但在精确概率集成方面可靠性较低。RLIE阐明了LLM在归纳推理中的潜力和局限性，并将其与经典概率规则组合方法结合，实现更可靠的神经符号推理。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can propose rules in natural language,
sidestepping the need for a predefined predicate space in traditional rule
learning. Yet many LLM-based approaches ignore interactions among rules, and
the opportunity to couple LLMs with probabilistic rule learning for robust
inference remains underexplored. We present RLIE, a unified framework that
integrates LLMs with probabilistic modeling to learn a set of weighted rules.
RLIE has four stages: (1) Rule generation, where an LLM proposes and filters
candidates; (2) Logistic regression, which learns probabilistic weights for
global selection and calibration; (3) Iterative refinement, which updates the
rule set using prediction errors; and (4) Evaluation, which compares the
weighted rule set as a direct classifier with methods that inject rules into an
LLM. We evaluate multiple inference strategies on real-world datasets. Applying
rules directly with their learned weights yields superior performance, whereas
prompting LLMs with the rules, weights, and logistic-model outputs surprisingly
degrades accuracy. This supports the view that LLMs excel at semantic
generation and interpretation but are less reliable for precise probabilistic
integration. RLIE clarifies the potential and limitations of LLMs for inductive
reasoning and couples them with classic probabilistic rule combination methods
to enable more reliable neuro-symbolic reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Memo是一个基于Transformer的架构和训练方法，用于强化学习中的长时程记忆密集型任务，通过插入周期性总结标记来创建和检索记忆，在计算和存储效率上优于传统长上下文Transformer基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于Transformer的具身智能体策略训练中，视觉输入常常超出Transformer的上下文限制，而人类能够将终身经验压缩为记忆来维持环境上下文。现有方法主要关注固定大小记忆的循环模型或完全依赖上下文的Transformer。

Method: 提出Memo架构，在模型训练期间通过插入周期性总结标记来创建和检索记忆，实现输入的高度压缩和抽象。

Result: 在网格世界元强化学习基准和逼真室内环境中的多目标导航任务上，Memo优于传统长上下文Transformer基线，同时计算和存储效率更高，在推理时对更长上下文具有更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: Memo在记忆密集型长时程任务中表现出色，能够有效处理历史上下文截断问题，在流式设置中保持鲁棒性。

Abstract: To enable embodied agents to operate effectively over extended timeframes, it
is crucial to develop models that form and access memories to stay
contextualized in their environment. In the current paradigm of training
transformer-based policies for embodied sequential decision-making tasks,
visual inputs often overwhelm the context limits of transformers, while humans
can maintain and utilize a lifetime of experience compressed as memories.
Significant compression is possible in principle, as much of the input is
irrelevant and can be abstracted. However, existing approaches predominantly
focus on either recurrent models with fixed-size memory or transformers with
full-context reliance. In this work, we propose Memo, a transformer-based
architecture and training recipe for reinforcement learning (RL) on
memory-intensive, long-horizon tasks. Memo incorporates the creation and
retrieval of memory by interleaving periodic summarization tokens with the
inputs of a model during training. We demonstrate Memo's effectiveness on a
gridworld meta-RL benchmark and a multi-object navigation task in
photo-realistic indoor settings. Memo outperforms naive long-context
transformer baselines while being more compute and storage efficient.
Additionally, Memo generalizes better to longer contexts at inference time and
remains robust in streaming settings, where historical context must be
truncated to fit inference constraints.

TL;DR: PROBE是一个评估LLM智能体主动性的新基准，将主动性分解为三个核心能力：搜索未指定问题、识别具体瓶颈和执行适当解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估主动性的基准局限于局部上下文，无法测试跨来源和长时间跨度的推理能力，需要新的评估框架。

Method: 提出PROBE基准，将主动性分解为三个能力阶段，并应用于评估领先的LLM和流行智能体框架。

Result: 即使是当前最先进的模型也难以解决该基准，GPT-5和Claude Opus-4.1的最佳端到端性能仅为40%。

Conclusion: 结果突显了智能体系统中自主行动的当前局限性，并揭示了有前景的未来研究方向。

Abstract: LLM-based agents are increasingly moving towards proactivity: rather than
awaiting instruction, they exercise agency to anticipate user needs and solve
them autonomously. However, evaluating proactivity is challenging; current
benchmarks are constrained to localized context, limiting their ability to test
reasoning across sources and longer time horizons. To address this gap, we
present PROBE (Proactive Resolution Of BottlEnecks). PROBE decomposes
proactivity as a pipeline of three core capabilities: (1) searching for
unspecified issues, (2) identifying specific bottlenecks, and (3) executing
appropriate resolutions. We apply PROBE to evaluate leading LLMs and popular
agentic frameworks, showing that even state-of-the-art models struggle to solve
this benchmark. Computing our consistent measurements across frontier LLMs and
agents, we find that the best end-to-end performance of 40% is achieved by both
GPT-5 and Claude Opus-4.1. Additionally, we demonstrate the relative
capabilities of each model and analyze mutual failure modes. Our results
highlight the current limitations of autonomous action in agentic systems, and
expose promising future research directions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前世界模型学习和评估方法偏离了目标：训练和评估都锚定在下一帧预测上，成功通过相同环境中的奖励最大化来评分。

Method: 提出WorldTest协议，包含无奖励探索、派生测试和行为评分三个模板，并实例化为AutumnBench测试套件，包含43个交互式网格世界环境和129个任务。

Result: 比较了517名人类参与者和三个前沿模型，发现人类表现优于模型，计算规模扩展只在某些环境中提高性能而非所有环境。

Conclusion: WorldTest提供了评估智能体对环境动态学习的新模板，AutumnBench揭示了世界模型学习的显著改进空间。

Abstract: Model-learning agents should gather information to learn world models that
support many downstream tasks and inferences, such as predicting unobserved
states, estimating near- and far-term consequences of actions, planning action
sequences, and detecting changes in dynamics. Current methods for learning and
evaluating world models diverge from this goal: training and evaluation are
anchored to next-frame prediction, and success is scored by reward maximization
in the same environment. We propose WorldTest, a protocol to evaluate
model-learning agents that separates reward-free interaction from a scored test
phase in a different but related environment. WorldTest is
open-ended$\unicode{x2014}$models should support many different tasks unknown
ahead of time$\unicode{x2014}$and agnostic to model representation, allowing
comparison across approaches. We instantiated WorldTest with AutumnBench, a
suite of 43 interactive grid-world environments and 129 tasks across three
families: masked-frame prediction, planning, and predicting changes to the
causal dynamics. We compared 517 human participants and three frontier models
on AutumnBench. We found that humans outperform the models, and scaling compute
improves performance only in some environments but not others. WorldTest
provides a novel template$\unicode{x2014}$reward-free exploration, derived
tests, and behavior-based scoring$\unicode{x2014}$to evaluate what agents learn
about environment dynamics, and AutumnBench exposes significant headroom in
world-model learning.

Conclusion: 通过使用预测信息，可以在几乎不牺牲鲁棒性的前提下实现渐进最优的一致性，显著提升公正选择机制的性能。

Abstract: We study the selection of agents based on mutual nominations, a theoretical
problem with many applications from committee selection to AI alignment. As
agents both select and are selected, they may be incentivized to misrepresent
their true opinion about the eligibility of others to influence their own
chances of selection. Impartial mechanisms circumvent this issue by
guaranteeing that the selection of an agent is independent of the nominations
cast by that agent. Previous research has established strong bounds on the
performance of impartial mechanisms, measured by their ability to approximate
the number of nominations for the most highly nominated agents. We study to
what extent the performance of impartial mechanisms can be improved if they are
given a prediction of a set of agents receiving a maximum number of
nominations. Specifically, we provide bounds on the consistency and robustness
of such mechanisms, where consistency measures the performance of the
mechanisms when the prediction is accurate and robustness its performance when
the prediction is inaccurate. For the general setting where up to $k$ agents
are to be selected and agents nominate any number of other agents, we give a
mechanism with consistency $1-O\big(\frac{1}{k}\big)$ and robustness
$1-\frac{1}{e}-O\big(\frac{1}{k}\big)$. For the special case of selecting a
single agent based on a single nomination per agent, we prove that
$1$-consistency can be achieved while guaranteeing $\frac{1}{2}$-robustness. A
close comparison with previous results shows that (asymptotically) optimal
consistency can be achieved with little to no sacrifice in terms of robustness.

Motivation: 现实决策系统的目标不仅限于产生好的预测结果，还需要考虑诱导特定激励的外部效应，即某些特征变化对决策者更有利，并且需要公平地激励异质代理进行期望的特征改变。

Result: 通过理论分析证明了在多种广泛公平度量下，决策者受特定期望公平容忍度约束时的最优性损失的理论保证。在真实数据集上的实验显示了在最大化准确性和期望努力公平性之间的明确权衡关系。

Conclusion: 该研究为战略学习环境中的公平激励设计提供了理论框架和实证证据，揭示了决策者在追求准确性和公平性之间需要做出的权衡决策。

Abstract: Strategic learning studies how decision rules interact with agents who may
strategically change their inputs/features to achieve better outcomes. In
standard settings, models assume that the decision-maker's sole scope is to
learn a classifier that maximizes an objective (e.g., accuracy) assuming that
agents best respond. However, real decision-making systems' goals do not align
exclusively with producing good predictions. They may consider the external
effects of inducing certain incentives, which translates to the change of
certain features being more desirable for the decision maker. Further, the
principal may also need to incentivize desirable feature changes fairly across
heterogeneous agents. How much does this constrained optimization (i.e.,
maximize the objective, but restrict agents' incentive disparity) cost the
principal? We propose a unified model of principal-agent interaction that
captures this trade-off under three additional components: (1) causal
dependencies between features, such that changes in one feature affect others;
(2) heterogeneous manipulation costs between agents; and (3) peer learning,
through which agents infer the principal's rule. We provide theoretical
guarantees on the principal's optimality loss constrained to a particular
desirability fairness tolerance for multiple broad classes of fairness
measures. Finally, through experiments on real datasets, we show the explicit
tradeoff between maximizing accuracy and fairness in desirability effort.

Abstract: Advertisement auctions play a crucial role in revenue generation for
e-commerce companies. To make the bidding procedure scalable to thousands of
auctions, the automatic bidding (autobidding) algorithms are actively developed
in the industry. Therefore, the fair and reproducible evaluation of autobidding
algorithms is an important problem. We present a standardized and transparent
evaluation protocol for comparing classical and reinforcement learning (RL)
autobidding algorithms. We consider the most efficient autobidding algorithms
from different classes, e.g., ones based on the controllers, RL, optimal
formulas, etc., and benchmark them in the bidding environment. We utilize the
most recent open-source environment developed in the industry, which accurately
emulates the bidding process. Our work demonstrates the most promising use
cases for the considered autobidding algorithms, highlights their surprising
drawbacks, and evaluates them according to multiple metrics. We select the
evaluation metrics that illustrate the performance of the autobidding
algorithms, the corresponding costs, and track the budget pacing. Such a choice
of metrics makes our results applicable to the broad range of platforms where
autobidding is effective. The presented comparison results help practitioners
to evaluate the candidate autobidding algorithms from different perspectives
and select ones that are efficient according to their companies' targets.

TL;DR: 该论文比较了重复多单位拍卖中的两种主要格式：统一价格拍卖和歧视性拍卖，从单个竞标者学习对抗随机对手的角度分析学习难度。研究发现两种拍卖格式在最坏情况下的遗憾界限相似，但在某些情况下统一价格拍卖可能具有更快的收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重复多单位拍卖在电力市场和国债拍卖中很常见，但不同拍卖格式对竞标者学习策略的影响尚未得到充分研究。论文旨在比较统一价格拍卖和歧视性拍卖的学习难度差异。

Method: 通过理论分析比较两种拍卖格式的学习难度，考虑全信息和强盗反馈两种场景，分析遗憾界限的缩放行为。还特别分析了对称单位需求参与者的特定情况。

Result: 在最坏情况下，两种拍卖格式的遗憾界限相似：全信息反馈下为$\tilde{\Theta} ( \sqrt{T} )$，强盗反馈下为$\tilde{\Theta} ( T^{2/3} )$。但在某些设置中，统一价格拍卖可能达到$\tilde{\Theta} ( \sqrt{T} )$的遗憾率，而歧视性拍卖仍为$\tilde{\Theta} ( T^{2/3} )$。

Conclusion: 虽然两种拍卖格式在最坏情况下的学习难度相似，但统一价格拍卖在某些情况下可能提供更快的收敛速度，特别是在对称单位需求参与者的场景中，这种差异更加明显。

Abstract: Repeated multi-unit auctions, where a seller allocates multiple identical
items over many rounds, are common mechanisms in electricity markets and
treasury auctions. We compare the two predominant formats: uniform-price and
discriminatory auctions, focusing on the perspective of a single bidder
learning to bid against stochastic adversaries. We characterize the learning
difficulty in each format, showing that the regret scales similarly for both
auction formats under both full-information and bandit feedback, as
$\tilde{\Theta} ( \sqrt{T} )$ and $\tilde{\Theta} ( T^{2/3} )$, respectively.
However, analysis beyond worst-case regret reveals structural differences:
uniform-price auctions may admit faster learning rates, with regret scaling as
$\tilde{\Theta} ( \sqrt{T} )$ in settings where discriminatory auctions remain
at $\tilde{\Theta} ( T^{2/3} )$. Finally, we provide a specific analysis for
auctions in which the other participants are symmetric and have unit-demand,
and show that in these instances, a similar regret rate separation appears.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统成比例性公理（如JR和EJR）依赖于固定配额（如Hare或Droop配额），本文旨在超越这种固定配额范式，引入实例相关的配额概念。

Method: 引入基于实例相关配额的成比例性概念，使用整数线性规划（ILP）计算满足α-JR的委员会，并在选民区间（VI）和候选人区间（CI）域中提供积极结果。

Result: 证明所有常见投票规则与最优解的距离可达k²/(k+1)²，确定给定批准配置满足α-JR的最优α值是NP完全问题。

Conclusion: 实例相关配额为成比例性研究提供了新视角，虽然计算最优α是NP完全的，但ILP方法在特定领域（VI和CI）中提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Justified representation (JR) and extended justified representation (EJR) are
well-established proportionality axioms in approval-based multiwinner voting.
Both axioms are always satisfiable, but they rely on a fixed quota (typically
Hare or Droop), with the Droop quota being the smallest one that guarantees
existence across all instances. With this observation in mind, we take a first
step beyond the fixed-quota paradigm and introduce proportionality notions
where the quota is instance-dependent. We demonstrate that all commonly studied
voting rules can have an additive distance to the optimum of
$\frac{k^2}{(k+1)^2}$. Moreover, we look into the computational aspects of our
instance-dependent quota and prove that determining the optimal value of
$\alpha$ for a given approval profile satisfying $\alpha$-JR is NP-complete. To
address this, we introduce an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation for
computing committees that satisfy $\alpha$-JR, and we provide positive results
in the voter interval (VI) and candidate interval (CI) domains.

Method: 为每个智能体在其附近区域提供信息性的时空线索，虽然需要随着智能体移动重新计算，但能够显著提升规划质量。

Result: 当应用于领先的配置求解器LaCAM时，这种局部指导方法为MAPF建立了新的性能前沿。

Conclusion: 局部指导方法能够在适度时间预算内显著改善MAPF解的质量，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Guidance is an emerging concept that improves the empirical performance of
real-time, sub-optimal multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) methods. It offers
additional information to MAPF algorithms to mitigate congestion on a global
scale by considering the collective behavior of all agents across the entire
workspace. This global perspective helps reduce agents' waiting times, thereby
improving overall coordination efficiency. In contrast, this study explores an
alternative approach: providing local guidance in the vicinity of each agent.
While such localized methods involve recomputation as agents move and may
appear computationally demanding, we empirically demonstrate that supplying
informative spatiotemporal cues to the planner can significantly improve
solution quality without exceeding a moderate time budget. When applied to
LaCAM, a leading configuration-based solver, this form of guidance establishes
a new performance frontier for MAPF.

Result: 实验显示平均MAE降低35%，天气监测稳定，高风险交通处理效果0.85，安全/火灾场景自适应信任调节0.65。3代理部署吞吐量13.8-17.2请求/秒，执行时间<72ms，治理延迟<100ms。跨域规则确保安全互操作性。

Conclusion: SORA-ATMAS被验证为监管对齐、上下文感知且可验证的治理框架，能够将分布式代理输出整合为可问责的实时决策，为智能城市管理提供弹性基础。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of smart cities has increased the reliance on intelligent
interconnected services to optimize infrastructure, resources, and citizen
well-being. Agentic AI has emerged as a key enabler by supporting autonomous
decision-making and adaptive coordination, allowing urban systems to respond in
real time to dynamic conditions. Its benefits are evident in areas such as
transportation, where the integration of traffic data, weather forecasts, and
safety sensors enables dynamic rerouting and a faster response to hazards.
However, its deployment across heterogeneous smart city ecosystems raises
critical governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) challenges, including
accountability, data privacy, and regulatory alignment within decentralized
infrastructures. Evaluation of SORA-ATMAS with three domain agents (Weather,
Traffic, and Safety) demonstrated that its governance policies, including a
fallback mechanism for high-risk scenarios, effectively steer multiple LLMs
(GPT, Grok, DeepSeek) towards domain-optimized, policy-aligned outputs,
producing an average MAE reduction of 35% across agents. Results showed stable
weather monitoring, effective handling of high-risk traffic plateaus 0.85, and
adaptive trust regulation in Safety/Fire scenarios 0.65. Runtime profiling of a
3-agent deployment confirmed scalability, with throughput between 13.8-17.2
requests per second, execution times below 72~ms, and governance delays under
100 ms, analytical projections suggest maintained performance at larger scales.
Cross-domain rules ensured safe interoperability, with traffic rerouting
permitted only under validated weather conditions. These findings validate
SORA-ATMAS as a regulation-aligned, context-aware, and verifiable governance
framework that consolidates distributed agent outputs into accountable,
real-time decisions, offering a resilient foundation for smart-city management.

Abstract: With the advancements in hardware, software, and large language model
technologies, the interaction between humans and operating systems has evolved
from the command-line interface to the rapidly emerging AI agent interactions.
Building an operating system (OS) agent capable of executing user instructions
and faithfully following user desires is becoming a reality. In this technical
report, we present ColorAgent, an OS agent designed to engage in long-horizon,
robust interactions with the environment while also enabling personalized and
proactive user interaction. To enable long-horizon interactions with the
environment, we enhance the model's capabilities through step-wise
reinforcement learning and self-evolving training, while also developing a
tailored multi-agent framework that ensures generality, consistency, and
robustness. In terms of user interaction, we explore personalized user intent
recognition and proactive engagement, positioning the OS agent not merely as an
automation tool but as a warm, collaborative partner. We evaluate ColorAgent on
the AndroidWorld and AndroidLab benchmarks, achieving success rates of 77.2%
and 50.7%, respectively, establishing a new state of the art. Nonetheless, we
note that current benchmarks are insufficient for a comprehensive evaluation of
OS agents and propose further exploring directions in future work, particularly
in the areas of evaluation paradigms, agent collaboration, and security. Our

integrates the GAMA simulation platform with an LLM-based generative agent,
along with General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data for public transport,
and OpenTripPlanner for multimodal routing. GAMA platform models the
interactive transport environment, providing visualization and dynamic agent
interactions while eliminating the need to construct the simulation environment
from scratch. This design enables a stronger focus on developing generative
agents and evaluating their performance in transport decision-making processes.
Over a simulated month, results show that agents not only make context-aware
transport decisions but also form habits over time. We conclude that combining
LLMs with agent-based simulation offers a promising direction for advancing
intelligent transportation systems and personalised multimodal mobility
solutions. We also discuss some limitations of this approach and outline future
work on scaling to larger regions, integrating real-time data, and refining
memory models.

### [108] [Polynomial-time Configuration Generator for Connected Unlabeled Multi-Agent Pathfinding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19567)
*Takahiro Suzuki,Keisuke Okumura*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 提出了PULL算法解决连通无标签多智能体路径规划问题，该算法在保持智能体连通性的同时，在多项式时间内找到可行解，并在实验中表现出良好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准多智能体路径规划无法保证智能体之间的连通性，而群机器人应用中如自重构和行进等场景需要保持连通性，因此需要解决连通无标签多智能体路径规划问题。

Method: 提出了基于规则的单步函数PULL算法，计算保持连通性并朝向目标配置的下一个配置，在2D网格中每步运行时间为O(n²)。

Result: PULL算法在随机生成的实例中，针对数百个智能体找到了具有竞争力的解质量，并开发了集成PULL的最终最优求解器用于小规模实例。

Conclusion: PULL算法是解决CUMAPF问题的轻量级、多项式时间完整算法，在实际应用中表现良好，为小规模实例提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: We consider Connected Unlabeled Multi-Agent Pathfinding (CUMAPF), a variant
of MAPF where the agents must maintain connectivity at all times. This problem
is fundamental to swarm robotics applications like self-reconfiguration and
marching, where standard MAPF is insufficient as it does not guarantee the
required connectivity between agents. While unlabeled MAPF is tractable in
optimization, CUMAPF is NP-hard even on highly restricted graph classes. To
tackle this challenge, we propose PULL, a complete and polynomial-time
algorithm with a simple design. It is based on a rule-based one-step function
that computes a subsequent configuration that preserves connectivity and
advances towards the target configuration. PULL is lightweight, and runs in
$O(n^2)$ time per step in 2D grid, where $n$ is the number of agents. Our
experiments further demonstrate its practical performance: PULL finds
competitive solution qualities against trivial solutions for hundreds of
agents, in randomly generated instances. Furthermore, we develop an eventually
optimal solver that integrates PULL into an existing search-based MAPF
algorithm, providing a valuable tool for small-scale instances.

Abstract: We present an experimental unit that realizes the ``multi-input, multi-output
manifold'' thermal management technology proposed by Lamarre & Raymond (2023).
The proposed setup can be used for experiments aimed at controlling
spatiotemporal temperature distribution. Temperature control is achieved by
impinging coolant fluid jets, leveraging a manifold of channels targeted to the
surface. The direction of the fluid is controlled by shifting the role of
channels between inputs, outputs, or closing them. Files associated with this
work include Computer-Aided Design (CAD) STEP files, Gerber files to
manufacture a Printed Circuit Board (PCB), and a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
written in Python. We provide a step-by-step guide to assemble the experimental
setup. We also provide instructions to interact with the setup through the GUI,
which allows for real-time tracking of sample temperature and flow rates per
flow control device. Additionally, we provide examples of usage of the setup,
including system characterization with step response,
Proportional-Integral-Derivative performance tracking, and disturbance
rejection in a coupled system. Extending the application is accessible through
the files provided in the open repository associated with this work. The active
cooling device presents a safe, flexible, and complete design, allowing for
lab-scale assessment of the performance of custom temperature control
strategies using enclosed impinging jets.

Result: 将分位数Velander公式简化为仅四个参数，且不牺牲预测性能，验证峰值负荷概率分布属于重尾Fréchet类

Conclusion: 提出的数学模型成功简化了分位数Velander公式，为大型非住宅用户的峰值负荷预测提供了理论基础

Abstract: Electrical grid congestion is a growing challenge in Europe, driving the need
for accurate prediction of load, particularly of peak load. Non-time-resolved
models of peak load offer the advantages of simplicity and compactness, and
among them, Velander's formula (VF) is a traditional method that has been used
for decades. Moreover, VF can be adapted into a quantile VF, which learns a
truncated cumulative distribution function of peak load based on electricity
consumption. This paper proposes a mathematical model based on extreme value
theory to characterize the probability distribution of peak load for large
non-residential customers. The model underpins the quantile VF as demonstrated
through multiple quantile regression and reduces its representation to just
four parameters without sacrificing predictive performance. Moreover, using
maximum likelihood estimation and the likelihood ratio test, we validate that
the probability distribution of peak load of analysed groups belongs to the
heavy-tailed Fr\'echet class.

Abstract: This paper proposes graph analysis methods to fully automate the fault
location identification task in power distribution systems. The proposed
methods take basic unordered data from power distribution systems as input,
including branch parameters, load values, and the location of measuring
devices. The proposed data preparation and analysis methods automatically
identify the system's topology and extract essential information, such as
faulted paths, structures, loading of laterals and sublaterals, and estimate
the fault location accordingly. The proposed graph analysis methods do not
require complex node and branch numbering processes or renumbering following
changes in the system topology. The proposed methods eliminate the need for

Abstract: The paper focuses on designing a controller for unknown dynamical multi-agent
systems to achieve temporal reach-avoid-stay tasks for each agent while
preventing inter-agent collisions. The main objective is to generate a
spatiotemporal tube (STT) for each agent and thereby devise a closed-form,
approximation-free, and decentralized control strategy that ensures the system
trajectory reaches the target within a specific time while avoiding
time-varying unsafe sets and collisions with other agents. In order to achieve
this, the requirements of STTs are formulated as a robust optimization problem
(ROP) and solved using a sampling-based scenario optimization problem (SOP) to
address the issue of infeasibility caused by the infinite number of constraints
in ROP. The STTs are generated by solving the SOP, and the corresponding
closed-form control is designed to fulfill the specified task. Finally, the
effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through two case studies, one
involving omnidirectional robots and the other involving multiple drones
modelled as Euler-Lagrange systems.

Result: 经过5年模拟，学习到的强化学习策略在延长车队服务寿命和缓解电网压力方面优于基线策略。

Conclusion: 该模拟器能够帮助车队运营商评估不同充电策略对关键指标的影响，为未来决策提供依据。

Abstract: Operating fleets of electric vehicles (EVs) introduces several challenges,
some of which are borne by the fleet operator, and some of which are borne by
the power grid. To maximize short-term profit a fleet operator could always
charge EVs at the maximum rate to ensure vehicles are ready to service ride
demand. However, due to the stochastic nature of electricity demand, charging
EVs at their maximum rate may potentially increase the grid stress and lead to
overall instability. Furthermore, high-rate charging of EVs can accelerate
battery degradation, thereby reducing the service lifespan of the fleet. This
study aims to reconcile the conflicting incentives of fleet longevity,
short-term profitability, and grid stability by simulating a taxi fleet
throughout its lifespan in relation to its charging policies and service
conditions. We develop an EV fleet simulator to evaluate the battery
degradation due to unpredictable charging and ride demand. Consequently, the
impact on the power grid through the charging infrastructure is assessed due to
these activities. This simulation utilizes publicly accessible real-world
travel data from the NYC taxi dataset. We compare a baseline 80-20 fleet
charging policy with a reinforcement learning-based policy designed to prolong
the fleet's service life and alleviate grid stress. We monitor grid stress,
battery degradation, and profitability over five years and find that our
learned policy outperforms the baseline. This simulator enables fleet operators
to assess the impact of different charging policies on these indicators to make
informed decisions in the future.

Abstract: This study presents a control strategy for coordinating multiple unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs) to monitor unknown flood regions and estimate the extent
of inundation. The proposed method adopts a density-driven coverage framework
based on Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation (CVT), in which the density function
is modeled using a Gaussian Mixture of Density Functions (GMDF). This
formulation provides a more accurate characterization of inundated areas
compared to conventional axis-aligned Gaussian models. The performance of the
two density modeling approaches is systematically evaluated under different UAV
fleet sizes (16, 20, and 24), with multiple simulation trials conducted in the
ROS/Gazebo environment. The results show that the GMDF-based formulation
consistently achieves higher coverage rates, demonstrating its effectiveness in
enhancing flood monitoring and improving UAV spatial distribution.

through case studies on a differential-drive mobile robot and a quadrotor, and
provide a comparative analysis showing improved efficiency over existing
approaches.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel structure-preserving, Kron-based reduction
framework for unbalanced distribution feeders. The method aggregates
electrically similar nodes within a mixed-integer optimization (MIP) problem to
produce reduced networks that optimally reproduce the voltage profiles of the
original full network. To overcome computational bottlenecks of MIP
formulations, we propose an exhaustive-search formulation to identify optimal
aggregation decisions while enforcing voltage margin limits. The proposed
exhaustive network reduction algorithm is parallelizable on GPUs, which enables
scalable network reduction. The resulting reduced networks approximate the full
system's voltage profiles with low errors and are suitable for steady-state
analysis and optimal power flow studies. The framework is validated on two real
utility distribution feeders with 5,991 and 8,381 nodes. The reduced models
achieve up to 90% and 80% network reduction, respectively, while the maximum
voltage-magnitude error remains below 0.003 p.u. Furthermore, on a 1000-node
version of the network, the GPU-accelerated reduction algorithm runs up to 15x

Conclusion: 3D多目标优化框架能够捕捉1D和2D优化无法覆盖的可行空间，实现环境自适应的推理扩展参数选择。

Abstract: AI inference scaling is often tuned through 1D heuristics (a fixed reasoning
passes) or 2D bivariate trade-offs (e.g., performance vs. compute), which fail
to consider cost and latency constraints. We introduce a 3D optimization
framework that jointly calibrates accuracy, cost, and latency within a unified
decision space, enabling constraints-aware inference scaling. Using Monte Carlo
simulations across three representative scenarios and nine simulated large
language models, we evaluate four optimization methods to address the 3D
multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. Framing inference scaling in MOO
shapes a feasible space that 1D and 2D optimizations fail to capture, enabling
environmentadaptive selection of the inference scaling k. Results show that
knee-point optimization achieves the best balance, while accuracy-maximization
remains favorable when precision is prioritized. The framework establishes a
theoretical foundation for deployment-aware inference scaling across diverse
operational contexts.

Abstract: Most machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which
poses security concerns on these models. Adversarial examples are crafted by
applying subtle but intentionally worst-case modifications to examples from the
dataset, leading the model to output a different answer from the original
example. In this paper, adversarial examples are formed in an exactly opposite
manner, which are significantly different from the original examples but result
in the same answer. We propose a novel set of algorithms to produce such
adversarial examples, including the negative iterative fast gradient sign
method (NI-FGSM) and the negative iterative fast gradient method (NI-FGM),
along with their momentum variants: the negative momentum iterative fast
gradient sign method (NMI-FGSM) and the negative momentum iterative fast
gradient method (NMI-FGM). Adversarial examples constructed by these methods
could be used to perform an attack on machine learning systems in certain
occasions. Moreover, our results show that the adversarial examples are not
merely distributed in the neighbourhood of the examples from the dataset;

*Ziquan Wei,Tingting Dan,Guorong Wu*

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多任务学习和半监督微调的功能性神经影像基础模型，通过利用丰富的环境变量和人口统计数据来改进脑-结果关系的建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型在功能性神经影像应用中受限于样本量不足，自监督学习与脑-结果关系不一致导致基础模型对下游任务不理想。

Method: 采用多任务预训练方法，将多个脑-环境交互(BEI)标记化，并通过为预训练的BEI分配伪标签进行半监督微调。

Result: 在性别预测、人类行为识别以及自闭症、帕金森病、阿尔茨海默病和精神分裂症等疾病的早期诊断中取得了有希望的结果。

Conclusion: 该基础模型具有促进当前神经影像在临床常规应用中应用的巨大潜力。

Abstract: A reliable foundation model of functional neuroimages is critical to promote
clinical applications where the performance of current AI models is
significantly impeded by a limited sample size. To that end, tremendous efforts
have been made to pretraining large models on extensive unlabeled fMRI data
using scalable self-supervised learning. Since self-supervision is not
necessarily aligned with the brain-to-outcome relationship, most foundation
models are suboptimal to the downstream task, such as predicting disease
outcomes. By capitalizing on rich environmental variables and demographic data
along with an unprecedented amount of functional neuroimages, we form the brain
modeling as a multitask learning and present a scalable model architecture for
(i) multitask pretraining by tokenizing multiple brain-environment interactions
(BEI) and (ii) semi-supervised finetuning by assigning pseudo-labels of
pretrained BEI. We have evaluated our foundation model on a variety of
applications, including sex prediction, human behavior recognition, and disease
early diagnosis of Autism, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and
{Schizophrenia}, where promising results indicate the great potential to
facilitate current neuroimaging applications in clinical routines.

### [124] [ADPO: Anchored Direct Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18913)
*Wang Zixian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADPO是一个统一框架，扩展了DPO，引入软偏好概率、任意参考策略锚定和列表偏好建模，在噪声环境下显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准DPO假设硬二元标签和成对比较，存在梯度漂移问题。ADPO旨在通过软偏好概率编码不确定性、参考策略锚定稳定训练，以及列表偏好建模来处理更复杂的偏好场景。

Method: ADPO引入：(1)软偏好概率缓解梯度漂移；(2)任意参考策略锚定通过组间平移不变性和隐式KL正则化稳定训练；(3)通过Plackett-Luce分布进行列表偏好建模。

Result: 在上下文赌博机中，锚定将WinMass提升38-63%；在重尾噪声下，KDE平滑实现0.68 vs 0.32（112%相对增益）；在顺序强化学习中，锚定在噪声偏好下提升15-29%性能。

Conclusion: ADPO将DPO、Bradley-Terry目标和Top-1-vs-Rest公式统一为特例。建议在清洁或中等噪声下使用成对锚定Soft-DPO，在极端污染下使用基于KDE的列表ADPO。

Abstract: Anchored Direct Preference Optimization (ADPO) is a unified framework that
generalizes Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with soft preferences,
reference-policy anchoring, and groupwise extensions. While standard DPO
assumes hard binary labels and pairwise comparisons, ADPO introduces: (i) soft
preference probabilities that encode uncertainty and mitigate gradient drift;
(ii) arbitrary reference-policy anchors that stabilize training via groupwise
shift invariance and implicit KL regularization; and (iii) listwise preference
modeling through Plackett-Luce distributions. We prove that DPO, Bradley-Terry
objectives, and Top-1-vs-Rest formulations emerge as special cases. ADPO yields
three practical variants: pairwise anchored Soft-DPO, listwise anchored
Soft-DPO with raw rewards, and KDE-based listwise smoothing for heavy-tailed
noise. In contextual bandits, anchoring improves WinMass by 38-63% over
standard DPO, while KDE smoothing achieves 0.68 vs 0.32 under heavy-tailed
contamination (112% relative gain). In sequential reinforcement learning
(CartPole, LunarLander), anchoring improves noisy-preference performance by
15-29%, confirming transfer from single-step to multi-step settings.
Experiments with 10-256 parameter models provide clear guidance: use pairwise
anchored Soft-DPO for clean or moderate noise, and KDE-based listwise ADPO for
extreme contamination.

*Daniel Zhao,Daniel Beaglehole,Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick,Julian McAuley,Zachary Novack*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MusicRFM框架通过递归特征机器在预训练音乐模型中实现细粒度、可解释的控制，无需重新训练模型，通过在推理时注入概念方向来指导生成过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可控音乐生成方法通常需要模型重新训练或会产生可听伪影，因此需要一种能够对冻结的预训练模型进行细粒度控制而不影响生成质量的方法。

Method: 训练轻量级RFM探针来发现MusicGen隐藏状态中的概念方向（对应音符、和弦等音乐属性），在推理时将这些方向注入回模型，采用动态时间变化调度和多属性同时执行机制。

Result: 将目标音符生成准确率从0.23提升到0.82，文本提示遵循度保持在无引导基线的约0.02范围内，在控制效果和生成质量之间取得了良好平衡。

Conclusion: MusicRFM框架成功实现了对预训练音乐模型的细粒度、可解释控制，在保持生成质量的同时显著提升了控制精度，为音乐领域的RFM应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Controllable music generation remains a significant challenge, with existing
methods often requiring model retraining or introducing audible artifacts. We
introduce MusicRFM, a framework that adapts Recursive Feature Machines (RFMs)
to enable fine-grained, interpretable control over frozen, pre-trained music
models by directly steering their internal activations. RFMs analyze a model's
internal gradients to produce interpretable "concept directions", or specific
axes in the activation space that correspond to musical attributes like notes
or chords. We first train lightweight RFM probes to discover these directions
within MusicGen's hidden states; then, during inference, we inject them back
into the model to guide the generation process in real-time without per-step
optimization. We present advanced mechanisms for this control, including
dynamic, time-varying schedules and methods for the simultaneous enforcement of
multiple musical properties. Our method successfully navigates the trade-off
between control and generation quality: we can increase the accuracy of
generating a target musical note from 0.23 to 0.82, while text prompt adherence
remains within approximately 0.02 of the unsteered baseline, demonstrating
effective control with minimal impact on prompt fidelity. We release code to
encourage further exploration on RFMs in the music domain.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型和机器学习的广泛应用，需要在笔记本电脑和移动设备等小型设备上部署这些模型，因此需要能够利用设备硬件的框架和方法。

Method: 创建MLX-transformers框架，包含不同的Transformer实现，并将PyTorch模型检查点转换为MLX格式，在苹果硅设备上进行推理延迟基准测试。

Result: 在苹果硅MacBook设备上对BERT、RoBERTa和XLM-RoBERTa模型进行性能评估，结果显示MLX在苹果生态系统中具有高效运行设备端机器学习应用的潜力。

Conclusion: MLX框架在苹果硅设备上展现出高效运行Transformer模型的潜力，为设备端机器学习应用提供了更便捷的解决方案。

Abstract: The recent widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) and machine
learning in general has sparked research interest in exploring the
possibilities of deploying these models on smaller devices such as laptops and
mobile phones. This creates a need for frameworks and approaches that are
capable of taking advantage of on-device hardware. The MLX framework was
created to address this need. It is a framework optimized for machine learning
(ML) computations on Apple silicon devices, facilitating easier research,
experimentation, and prototyping.
  This paper presents a performance evaluation of MLX, focusing on inference
latency of transformer models. We compare the performance of different
transformer architecture implementations in MLX with their Pytorch
counterparts. For this research we create a framework called MLX-transformers
which includes different transformer implementations in MLX and downloads the
model checkpoints in pytorch and converts it to the MLX format. By leveraging
the advanced architecture and capabilities of Apple Silicon, MLX-Transformers
enables seamless execution of transformer models directly sourced from Hugging
Face, eliminating the need for checkpoint conversion often required when
porting models between frameworks.
  Our study benchmarks different transformer models on two Apple Silicon
macbook devices against an NVIDIA CUDA GPU. Specifically, we compare the
inference latency performance of models with the same parameter sizes and
checkpoints. We evaluate the performance of BERT, RoBERTa, and XLM-RoBERTa
models, with the intention of extending future work to include models of
different modalities, thus providing a more comprehensive assessment of MLX's
capabilities. The results highlight MLX's potential in enabling efficient and
more accessible on-device ML applications within Apple's ecosystem.

Motivation: RLHF/RLVR等对齐方法对不一致或错误的奖励噪声高度敏感，但噪声与广泛使用的基于群体的策略优化方法之间的相互作用尚未充分探索

Method: 引入Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)和Done Right GRPO (Dr.GRPO)框架，将奖励腐败建模为伯努利噪声，通过估计奖励翻转概率进行噪声校正，得到可证明无偏的梯度估计

Result: 在数学和代码任务上观察到一致的改进，在真实奖励模型条件下，数学任务准确率提升高达6.7个百分点，代码任务提升1.5个百分点

Conclusion: 这项工作将监督学习中的标签噪声校正与现代RLHF连接起来，为噪声现实世界部署提供了理论见解和实用算法

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or verifiable rewards
(RLVR), the standard paradigm for aligning LLMs or building recent SOTA
reasoning models, is highly sensitive to noise from inconsistent or erroneous
rewards. Yet, the interaction between such noise and widely used group-based
policy optimization methods remains underexplored. We introduce a noise-robust
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Done Right GRPO (Dr.GRPO)
framework that explicitly models reward corruption as Bernoulli noise. Our
method applies noise correction after estimating reward flip probabilities to
debias the learning signal, yielding provably unbiased gradient estimates.
Theoretical analysis shows that group-based methods inherently mitigate
individual-level noise, and our correction strategy amplifies this robustness.
Empirically, we observe consistent improvements across math and code tasks when
applying our noise correction to standard reward model usage, with particular
gains of up to 6.7 percentage points in accuracy on math tasks and 1.5 on code
tasks under realistic reward model conditions. This work bridges label-noise
correction from supervised learning with modern RLHF, offering both theoretical
insights and a practical algorithm for noisy real-world deployment.

Conclusion: 提出的多尺度学习框架有效解决了复杂系统的建模挑战，提供了所有时间尺度的近似和解释，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Modeling and predicting the dynamics of complex multiscale systems remains a
significant challenge due to their inherent nonlinearities and sensitivity to
initial conditions, as well as limitations of traditional machine learning
methods that fail to capture high frequency behaviours. To overcome these
difficulties, we propose three approaches for multiscale learning. The first
leverages the Partition of Unity (PU) method, integrated with neural networks,
to decompose the dynamics into local components and directly predict both
macro- and micro-scale behaviors. The second applies the Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to extract dominant modes that explicitly separate macro-
and micro-scale dynamics. Since full access to the data matrix is rarely
available in practice, we further employ a Sparse High-Order SVD to reconstruct
multiscale dynamics from limited measurements. Together, these approaches
ensure that both coarse and fine dynamics are accurately captured, making the
framework effective for real-world applications involving complex, multi-scale
phenomena and adaptable to higher-dimensional systems with incomplete
observations, by providing an approximation and interpretation in all time
scales present in the phenomena under study.

Motivation: 离线强化学习在LLM对齐中样本效率高，但存在策略熵急剧下降、优化不稳定甚至崩溃的问题

Method: 提出BAPO方法，基于熵裁剪规则动态调整裁剪边界，自适应平衡正负贡献，保持熵值稳定

Result: 在AIME 2024/2025基准测试中，7B模型超越开源对手，32B模型在同规模模型中达到SOTA，甚至超过o3-mini和Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking等专有系统

Conclusion: BAPO通过动态裁剪机制有效解决了离线RL的稳定性问题，实现了快速、稳定、数据高效的训练

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become the core paradigm for
aligning and strengthening large language models (LLMs). Yet, applying RL in
off-policy settings--where stale data from past policies are used for
training--improves sample efficiency, but remains challenging: policy entropy
declines sharply, optimization often becomes unstable and may even collapse.
Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we identify two key insights: (i)
an imbalance in optimization, where negative-advantage samples dominate the
policy gradient, suppressing useful behaviors and risking gradient explosions;
and (ii) the derived Entropy-Clip Rule, which reveals that the fixed clipping
mechanism in PPO-like objectives systematically blocks entropy-increasing
updates, thereby driving the policy toward over-exploitation at the expense of
exploration. Building on these insights, we propose BAlanced Policy
Optimization with Adaptive Clipping (BAPO), a simple yet effective method that
dynamically adjusts clipping bounds to adaptively re-balance positive and
negative contributions, preserve entropy, and stabilize RL optimization. Across
diverse off-policy scenarios--including sample replay and partial rollout--BAPO
achieves fast, stable, and data-efficient training. On AIME 2024 and AIME 2025
benchmarks, our 7B BAPO model surpasses open-source counterparts such as
SkyWork-OR1-7B, while our 32B BAPO model not only achieves state-of-the-art
results among models of the same scale but also outperforms leading proprietary
systems like o3-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking.

TL;DR: 该立场论文指出许多深度神经网络的事后泛化度量是脆弱的——微小的训练修改可能显著改变度量值、趋势或缩放行为，建议新度量开发者应明确审计其脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然深度神经网络的各种泛化度量难以获得紧致边界，但通常被认为能再现定性泛化趋势。本文质疑这种假设，认为许多事后度量存在脆弱性问题。

Method: 通过实验分析不同训练修改（如超参数调整、优化器变体）对多种泛化度量的影响，包括路径范数、谱范数、Frobenius范数、平坦度代理和确定性PAC-Bayes代理等。

Result: 发现许多泛化度量对微小训练修改极其敏感，例如学习率调整可以反转学习曲线的斜率；PAC-Bayes原点度量虽然对超参数调整不敏感，但无法捕捉数据复杂度的差异。

Conclusion: 许多事后泛化度量存在脆弱性问题，新度量开发者应当明确审计其脆弱性，并建议关注函数基础的边际似然PAC-Bayes边界等更稳健的度量。

Abstract: A wide variety of generalization measures have been applied to deep neural
networks (DNNs). Although obtaining tight bounds remains challenging, such
measures are often assumed to reproduce qualitative generalization trends. In
this position paper, we argue that many post-mortem generalization measures --
those computed on trained networks -- are \textbf{fragile}: small training
modifications that barely affect the underlying DNN can substantially change a
measure's value, trend, or scaling behavior. For example, minor hyperparameter
changes, such as learning rate adjustments or switching between SGD variants
can reverse the slope of a learning curve in widely used generalization
measures like the path norm. We also identify subtler forms of fragility. For
instance, the PAC-Bayes origin measure is regarded as one of the most reliable,
and is indeed less sensitive to hyperparameter tweaks than many other measures.
However, it completely fails to capture differences in data complexity across
learning curves. This data fragility contrasts with the function-based
marginal-likelihood PAC-Bayes bound, which does capture differences in
data-complexity, including scaling behavior, in learning curves, but which is
not a post-mortem measure. Beyond demonstrating that many bounds -- such as
path, spectral and Frobenius norms, flatness proxies, and deterministic
PAC-Bayes surrogates -- are fragile, this position paper also argues that
developers of new measures should explicitly audit them for fragility.

TL;DR: NeuroAda是一种新的参数高效微调方法，通过识别重要参数并为其添加旁路连接，在保持高内存效率的同时实现细粒度模型微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的参数高效微调方法存在权衡：基于添加的方法（如LoRA）内存效率高但表示能力有限，而选择性原位适应方法适应更精确但内存消耗大。

Method: 首先识别网络中的重要参数，然后为这些选定的参数引入旁路连接。在微调过程中，只更新旁路连接，保持原始模型参数冻结。

Result: 在23+个自然语言生成和理解任务上的实验表明，NeuroAda仅需≤0.02%的可训练参数就能达到最先进性能，同时将CUDA内存使用减少高达60%。

Conclusion: NeuroAda成功解决了参数高效微调中的权衡问题，在保持高内存效率的同时实现了细粒度模型适应。

Abstract: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods primarily fall into
two categories: addition-based and selective in-situ adaptation. The former,
such as LoRA, introduce additional modules to adapt the model to downstream
tasks, offering strong memory efficiency. However, their representational
capacity is often limited, making them less suitable for fine-grained
adaptation. In contrast, the latter directly fine-tunes a carefully chosen
subset of the original model parameters, allowing for more precise and
effective adaptation, but at the cost of significantly increased memory
consumption. To reconcile this trade-off, we propose NeuroAda, a novel PEFT
method that enables fine-grained model finetuning while maintaining high memory
efficiency. Our approach first identifies important parameters (i.e.,
connections within the network) as in selective adaptation, and then introduces
bypass connections for these selected parameters. During finetuning, only the
bypass connections are updated, leaving the original model parameters frozen.
Empirical results on 23+ tasks spanning both natural language generation and
understanding demonstrate that NeuroAda achieves state-of-the-art performance
with as little as $\leq \textbf{0.02}\%$ trainable parameters, while reducing
CUDA memory usage by up to 60%. We release our code here:

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了神经算子在分布外泛化方面的局限性，为快速PDE求解提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Nonlinear PDE solvers require fine space-time discretizations and local
linearizations, leading to high memory cost and slow runtimes. Neural operators
such as FNOs and DeepONets offer fast single-shot inference by learning
function-to-function mappings and truncating high-frequency components, but
they suffer from poor out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, often failing
on inputs outside the training distribution. We propose an adversarial
teacher-student distillation framework in which a differentiable numerical
solver supervises a compact neural operator while a PGD-style active sampling
loop searches for worst-case inputs under smoothness and energy constraints to
expand the training set. Using differentiable spectral solvers enables
gradient-based adversarial search and stabilizes sample mining. Experiments on
Burgers and Navier-Stokes systems demonstrate that adversarial distillation
substantially improves OOD robustness while preserving the low parameter cost
and fast inference of neural operators.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is important in modern large-scale systems and
is applied in a variety of domains to analyze and monitor the operation of
diverse systems. Unsupervised approaches have received widespread interest, as
they do not require anomaly labels during training, thus avoiding potentially
high costs and having wider applications. Among these, autoencoders have
received extensive attention. They use reconstruction errors from compressed
representations to define anomaly scores. However, representations learned by
autoencoders are sensitive to anomalies in training time series, causing
reduced accuracy. We propose a novel encode-then-decompose paradigm, where we
decompose the encoded representation into stable and auxiliary representations,
thereby enhancing the robustness when training with contaminated time series.
In addition, we propose a novel mutual information based metric to replace the
reconstruction errors for identifying anomalies. Our proposal demonstrates
competitive or state-of-the-art performance on eight commonly used multi- and
univariate time series benchmarks and exhibits robustness to time series with
different contamination ratios.

Abstract: Current medical practice depends on standardized treatment frameworks and

suboptimal health outcomes. We develop a comprehensive system integrating Large
Language Models (LLMs), Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks

provide customized, data-informed clinical recommendations. The approach
utilizes LLMs to process unstructured medical narratives into structured

patient-specific treatment responses (84.3% accuracy), and integrates
prior-informed contextual bandits to enhance online therapeutic selection by
effectively balancing exploration of new possibilities with exploitation of
existing knowledge. Testing on stage III colon cancer datasets revealed that
our KernelUCB approach obtained 0.60-0.61 average reward scores across 5,000

cold-start limitations in online learning environments, improves computational

Conclusion: 类别学习通过最大化互信息诱导神经空间在决策边界附近的扩展，这一现象是高效学习的必然结果。该框架与信息瓶颈方法相关，并提供了贝叶斯成本的偏差-方差分解。

Abstract: In animals, category learning enhances discrimination between stimuli close
to the category boundary. This phenomenon, called categorical perception, was
also empirically observed in artificial neural networks trained on
classification tasks. In previous modeling works based on neuroscience data, we
show that this expansion/compression is a necessary outcome of efficient
learning. Here we extend our theoretical framework to artificial networks. We
show that minimizing the Bayes cost (mean of the cross-entropy loss) implies
maximizing the mutual information between the set of categories and the neural
activities prior to the decision layer. Considering structured data with an
underlying feature space of small dimension, we show that maximizing the mutual
information implies (i) finding an appropriate projection space, and, (ii)
building a neural representation with the appropriate metric. The latter is
based on a Fisher information matrix measuring the sensitivity of the neural
activity to changes in the projection space. Optimal learning makes this neural
Fisher information follow a category-specific Fisher information, measuring the
sensitivity of the category membership. Category learning thus induces an
expansion of neural space near decision boundaries. We characterize the
properties of the categorical Fisher information, showing that its eigenvectors
give the most discriminant directions at each point of the projection space. We
find that, unexpectedly, its maxima are in general not exactly at, but near,
the class boundaries. Considering toy models and the MNIST dataset, we
numerically illustrate how after learning the two Fisher information matrices
match, and essentially align with the category boundaries. Finally, we relate
our approach to the Information Bottleneck one, and we exhibit a bias-variance

*Nakul Upadhya,Eldan Cohen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的决策树泛化方法——形状泛化树(SGT)，通过在每个内部节点应用可学习的轴对齐形状函数，实现非线性划分，同时保持可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统决策树依赖简单的轴对齐线性分割，需要深度复杂的结构来捕捉非线性特征效应，这削弱了人类对构建树的理解。

Method: 提出SGT框架，每个内部节点对单个特征应用可学习的轴对齐形状函数；开发ShapeCART算法学习SGT；扩展到双变量形状函数(S²GT)和多路树(SGT_K)。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，SGT相比传统轴对齐线性树，在减少模型大小的同时实现了更优越的性能。

Conclusion: SGT通过引入可学习的形状函数，在保持可解释性的同时显著提升了决策树的表达能力，为可解释机器学习提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Decision trees are prized for their interpretability and strong performance
on tabular data. Yet, their reliance on simple axis-aligned linear splits often
forces deep, complex structures to capture non-linear feature effects,
undermining human comprehension of the constructed tree. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel generalization of a decision tree, the Shape
Generalized Tree (SGT), in which each internal node applies a learnable
axis-aligned shape function to a single feature, enabling rich, non-linear
partitioning in one split. As users can easily visualize each node's shape
function, SGTs are inherently interpretable and provide intuitive, visual
explanations of the model's decision mechanisms. To learn SGTs from data, we
propose ShapeCART, an efficient induction algorithm for SGTs. We further extend
the SGT framework to bivariate shape functions (S$^2$GT) and multi-way trees
(SGT$_K$), and present Shape$^2$CART and ShapeCART$_K$, extensions to ShapeCART
for learning S$^2$GTs and SGT$_K$s, respectively. Experiments on various
datasets show that SGTs achieve superior performance with reduced model size
compared to traditional axis-aligned linear trees.

TL;DR: POLAR使用强化学习动态选择联邦学习中的关键层进行后门攻击，通过伯努利采样和策略梯度优化攻击策略，在保持隐蔽性的同时实现高攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习后门攻击方法基于规则选择关键层，未考虑层间相互关系，导致攻击效果不佳且容易被先进防御检测。

Method: 提出POLAR框架，采用轻量级强化学习（伯努利采样）动态学习攻击策略，通过策略梯度更新优化层选择，并引入正则化约束限制修改层数以保持隐蔽性。

Result: 在对抗六种最先进防御方法时，POLAR比最新攻击方法性能提升高达40%。

Conclusion: POLAR证明了强化学习在联邦学习后门攻击中的有效性，能够动态优化层选择策略，在保持隐蔽性的同时显著提高攻击成功率。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training across multiple
clients without exposing local data, but its distributed feature makes it
vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Despite early FL backdoor attacks modifying
entire models, recent studies have explored the concept of backdoor-critical
(BC) layers, which poison the chosen influential layers to maintain
stealthiness while achieving high effectiveness. However, existing BC layers
approaches rely on rule-based selection without consideration of the
interrelations between layers, making them ineffective and prone to detection
by advanced defenses. In this paper, we propose POLAR (POlicy-based LAyerwise
Reinforcement learning), the first pipeline to creatively adopt RL to solve the
BC layer selection problem in layer-wise backdoor attack. Different from other
commonly used RL paradigm, POLAR is lightweight with Bernoulli sampling. POLAR
dynamically learns an attack strategy, optimizing layer selection using policy
gradient updates based on backdoor success rate (BSR) improvements. To ensure
stealthiness, we introduce a regularization constraint that limits the number
of modified layers by penalizing large attack footprints. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that POLAR outperforms the latest attack methods by up to 40%
against six state-of-the-art (SOTA) defenses.

*Atli Kosson,Jeremy Welborn,Yang Liu,Martin Jaggi,Xi Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文通过大规模实证研究发现，Maximal Update Parameterization (muP) 的学习率缩放规则仅在训练初期有效，而在实际LLM训练中，权重衰减才是稳定内部表示更新动态的关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究muP学习率缩放规则在神经网络训练中的实际有效性，特别是在大规模语言模型训练场景下，理解学习率传递机制的本质。

Method: 进行大规模实证调查，分析muP假设在实际训练过程中的有效性，比较不同宽度模型下的更新动态稳定性。

Result: 发现muP的假设仅在训练初期短暂成立，而在大部分训练过程中，权重衰减才是稳定内部表示更新动态的主要因素，muP主要起到隐式学习率预热的作用。

Conclusion: 这些发现挑战了关于学习率传递的普遍认知，解释了为什么muP需要独立权重衰减变体才能成功实现学习率传递。

Abstract: Transferring the optimal learning rate from small to large neural networks
can enable efficient training at scales where hyperparameter tuning is
otherwise prohibitively expensive. To this end, the Maximal Update
Parameterization (muP) proposes a learning rate scaling designed to keep the
update dynamics of internal representations stable across different model
widths. However, the scaling rules of muP rely on strong assumptions,
particularly about the geometric alignment of a layer's inputs with both its
weights and gradient updates. In this large-scale empirical investigation, we
show that these assumptions hold only briefly at the start of training in the
practical setups where learning rate transfer is most valuable, such as LLM
training. For the remainder of training it is weight decay rather than muP that
correctly stabilizes the update dynamics of internal representations across
widths, facilitating learning rate transfer. This suggests muP's scaling
primarily acts as a form of implicit learning rate warmup, allowing us to
largely replace it with modified warmup schedules. Together these findings
fundamentally challenge prevailing beliefs about learning rate transfer and can
explain empirical practice such as why muP requires the independent weight
decay variant for successful transfer.

TL;DR: 本文通过统一的离线评估框架，将课程学习难度分解为五个维度，研究了不同课程策略在数学推理任务中的效果，发现没有统一的课程策略，其有效性取决于模型能力和任务复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有课程学习研究使用不同的难度指标和训练设置，缺乏对课程学习何时有效、正向还是反向课程更好等基本问题的系统研究。

Method: 使用统一的离线评估框架，将课程难度分解为五个维度：问题难度、模型惊讶度、置信度边际、预测不确定性和决策变异性，并在Llama3.1-8B、Mistral-7B和Gemma3-4B模型上进行数学推理基准测试。

Result: 研究发现：(i) 没有统一的课程策略，正向与反向课程学习的相对有效性取决于模型能力和任务复杂性；(ii) 同一指标内不同难度样本根据任务需求产生不同增益；(iii) 任务对齐课程关注最终表示和泛化，而内部状态课程调节置信度和不确定性。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了通用课程策略的概念，提供了跨模型和任务体系的实用指导，某些指标表明优先处理决策不确定样本可以进一步提升学习效果。

Abstract: Curriculum learning (CL) - ordering training data from easy to hard - has
become a popular strategy for improving reasoning in large language models
(LLMs). Yet prior work employs disparate difficulty metrics and training
setups, leaving open fundamental questions: When does curriculum help? Which
direction - forward or reverse - is better? And does the answer depend on what
we measure? We address these questions through a unified offline evaluation
framework that decomposes curriculum difficulty into five complementary
dimensions: Problem Difficulty, Model Surprisal, Confidence Margin, Predictive
Uncertainty, and Decision Variability. Through controlled post-training
experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks with Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B,
and Gemma3-4B, we find that (i) no curriculum strategy dominates universally -
the relative effectiveness of forward versus reverse CL depends jointly on
model capability and task complexity; (ii) even within a single metric, samples
at different difficulty levels produce distinct gains depending on task
demands; and (iii) task-aligned curricula focus on shaping the model's final
representations and generalization, whereas inner-state curricula modulate
internal states such as confidence and uncertainty. Our findings challenge the
notion of a universal curriculum strategy and offer actionable guidance across
model and task regimes, with some metrics indicating that prioritizing
decision-uncertain samples can further enhance learning outcomes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MetaCluster框架通过元学习器和聚类技术，将KANs的参数存储减少高达80倍，同时保持准确性不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KANs用向量权重替换标量权重提高了表达能力，但也导致参数和内存的乘性增长，需要压缩方法。

Method: 使用轻量级元学习器将低维嵌入映射到系数向量，通过K-means聚类将每边向量替换为共享质心，最后微调质心码本。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上，MetaCluster实现了参数存储减少高达80倍，且无精度损失。

Conclusion: MetaCluster成功解决了KANs参数存储问题，证明了利用参数向量性质进行压缩的可行性。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) replace scalar weights with per-edge
vectors of basis coefficients, thereby boosting expressivity and accuracy but
at the same time resulting in a multiplicative increase in parameters and
memory. We propose MetaCluster, a framework that makes KANs highly compressible
without sacrificing accuracy. Specifically, a lightweight meta-learner, trained
jointly with the KAN, is used to map low-dimensional embedding to coefficient
vectors, shaping them to lie on a low-dimensional manifold that is amenable to
clustering. We then run K-means in coefficient space and replace per-edge
vectors with shared centroids. Afterwards, the meta-learner can be discarded,
and a brief fine-tuning of the centroid codebook recovers any residual accuracy
loss. The resulting model stores only a small codebook and per-edge indices,
exploiting the vector nature of KAN parameters to amortize storage across
multiple coefficients. On MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, across standard KANs
and ConvKANs using multiple basis functions, MetaCluster achieves a reduction
of up to 80$\times$ in parameter storage, with no loss in accuracy. Code will
be released upon publication.

Motivation: 在社交网络中，用户间的推荐采纳率高度依赖于上下文因素，准确估计这些影响力概率对于理解信息传播过程和改进病毒营销策略至关重要。现有方法要么浪费资源进行随机探索，要么仅优化奖励而忽略准确估计。

Method: 采用上下文线性赌博机框架，提出了一种不确定性引导的探索算法，通过调节参数可以在遗憾最小化和估计误差之间实现任意权衡。

Result: 在合成网络数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于静态方法和忽略这种权衡的上下文赌博机方法。

Conclusion: 本文证明了在同伴影响力概率学习中存在基本权衡，并提出了能够灵活调节权衡的算法，为信息传播建模和病毒营销提供了更有效的工具。

Abstract: In networked environments, users frequently share recommendations about
content, products, services, and courses of action with others. The extent to
which such recommendations are successful and adopted is highly contextual,
dependent on the characteristics of the sender, recipient, their relationship,
the recommended item, and the medium, which makes peer influence probabilities
highly heterogeneous. Accurate estimation of these probabilities is key to
understanding information diffusion processes and to improving the
effectiveness of viral marketing strategies. However, learning these
probabilities from data is challenging; static data may capture correlations
between peer recommendations and peer actions but fails to reveal influence
relationships. Online learning algorithms can learn these probabilities from
interventions but either waste resources by learning from random exploration or
optimize for rewards, thus favoring exploration of the space with higher
influence probabilities. In this work, we study learning peer influence
probabilities under a contextual linear bandit framework. We show that a
fundamental trade-off can arise between regret minimization and estimation
error, characterize all achievable rate pairs, and propose an
uncertainty-guided exploration algorithm that, by tuning a parameter, attains
any pair within this trade-off. Our experiments on semi-synthetic network
datasets show the advantages of our method over static methods and contextual
bandits that ignore this trade-off.

Method: 采用SHAP阈值识别关键信号段并转换为区间规则，使用动态时间规整和聚类提取代表性原型，通过R峰对齐确保与样本的一致性。

Result: 反事实修改仅78%原始信号，所有类别有效性达81.3%，时间稳定性提升43%。心肌梗死类别有效性达98.9%，但肥厚性心肌病检测面临挑战（13.2%）。

Conclusion: 建立了生理感知反事实解释的设计原则，为临床部署的交互式解释平台奠定了基础，支持近实时生成（<1秒）临床有效反事实。

Abstract: In eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), instance-based explanations for
time series have gained increasing attention due to their potential for
actionable and interpretable insights in domains such as healthcare. Addressing
the challenges of explainability of state-of-the-art models, we propose a
prototype-driven framework for generating sparse counterfactual explanations
tailored to 12-lead ECG classification models. Our method employs SHAP-based
thresholds to identify critical signal segments and convert them into interval
rules, uses Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and medoid clustering to extract
representative prototypes, and aligns these prototypes to query R-peaks for
coherence with the sample being explained. The framework generates
counterfactuals that modify only 78% of the original signal while maintaining
81.3% validity across all classes and achieving 43% improvement in temporal
stability. We evaluate three variants of our approach, Original, Sparse, and
Aligned Sparse, with class-specific performance ranging from 98.9% validity for
myocardial infarction (MI) to challenges with hypertrophy (HYP) detection
(13.2%). This approach supports near realtime generation (< 1 second) of
clinically valid counterfactuals and provides a foundation for interactive
explanation platforms. Our findings establish design principles for
physiologically-aware counterfactual explanations in AI-based diagnosis systems
and outline pathways toward user-controlled explanation interfaces for clinical
deployment.

Motivation: 传统Granger因果性测试基于线性模型，难以检测非线性因果关系。现有方法依赖因果充分性和已知干预目标两个关键假设，但实际时间序列数据通常存在潜在混杂因素和环境异质性，难以区分干预环境。

Method: 提出不变Granger因果性(InvarGC)，利用跨环境异质性来缓解潜在混杂效应，以边级粒度区分干预和非干预环境，从而恢复不变因果关系。

Conclusion: InvarGC能够有效解决传统Granger因果性方法在存在潜在混杂因素和环境异质性时的局限性，建立了在这些条件下的可识别性。

Abstract: Granger causality is widely used for causal structure discovery in complex
systems from multivariate time series data. Traditional Granger causality tests
based on linear models often fail to detect even mild non-linear causal
relationships. Therefore, numerous recent studies have investigated non-linear
Granger causality methods, achieving improved performance. However, these
methods often rely on two key assumptions: causal sufficiency and known
interventional targets. Causal sufficiency assumes the absence of latent
confounders, yet their presence can introduce spurious correlations. Moreover,
real-world time series data usually come from heterogeneous environments,
without prior knowledge of interventions. Therefore, in practice, it is
difficult to distinguish intervened environments from non-intervened ones, and
even harder to identify which variables or timesteps are affected. To address
these challenges, we propose Invariant Granger Causality (InvarGC), which
leverages cross-environment heterogeneity to mitigate the effects of latent
confounding and to distinguish intervened from non-intervened environments with
edge-level granularity, thereby recovering invariant causal relations. In
addition, we establish the identifiability under these conditions. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the
competitive performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习模型越来越多地在合成数据上微调，存在微妙错位通过互联AI系统传播的关键风险。需要量化理解潜隐污染的动力学机制。

Method: 使用GPT-2构建师生实验设置，系统研究潜隐污染的缩放规律、阈值和机制，包括行为交叉分析、相变检测和可解释性分析。

Result: 三个关键发现：1)潜隐污染导致行为交叉，降低模型整体对齐性；2)对齐性在污染数据临界阈值处发生急剧相变；3)污染机制模仿自然微调过程，难以检测。

Conclusion: 结果揭示了依赖合成数据的AI系统的关键脆弱性，强调需要能够考虑潜在威胁的新安全协议。

Abstract: As machine learning models are increasingly fine-tuned on synthetic data,
there is a critical risk of subtle misalignments spreading through
interconnected AI systems. This paper investigates subliminal corruption, which
we define as undesirable traits are transmitted through semantically neutral
data, bypassing standard safety checks. While this phenomenon has been
identified, a quantitative understanding of its dynamics is missing. To address
this gap, we present a systematic study of the scaling laws, thresholds, and
mechanisms of subliminal corruption using a teacher-student setup with GPT-2.
Our experiments reveal three key findings: (1) subliminal corruption causes
behavioral crossover, degrading the model's overall alignment, not just the
targeted trait; (2) alignment fails in a sharp phase transition at a critical
threshold of poisoned data, rather than degrading gradually; and (3)
interpretability analysis shows the corruption mechanism mimics the model's
natural fine-tuning process, making it difficult to detect. These results
demonstrate a critical vulnerability in AI systems that rely on synthetic data
and highlight the need for new safety protocols that can account for latent
threats.

Motivation: 解决参数高效微调方法在权重空间操作时过度专业化、容易覆盖预训练知识的问题，特别是在下游数据有限或与预训练分布差异大的场景中。

Method: 在特征空间进行微调，提出LoRFA（低秩特征适应）和VeFA（基于向量的特征适应），通过等效效应建模补偿下游潜伏变量的影响。

Result: 在图像分类、自然语言理解和生成任务上，与LoRA相比取得相当的微调效果，并在分布偏移下展现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 特征空间适应方法能有效保留预训练表示，提高模型在分布偏移下的泛化能力，是参数高效微调的有前景方向。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is a common issue in model fine-tuning, especially
when the downstream domain contains limited labeled data or differs greatly
from the pre-training distribution. Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning
methods operate in the weight space by modifying or augmenting the pre-trained
model's parameters, which can yield models overly specialized to the available
downstream data. To mitigate the risk of overwriting pre-trained knowledge and
enhance robustness, we propose to fine-tune the pre-trained model in the
feature space. Two new fine-tuning methods are proposed: LoRFA (Low-Rank
Feature Adaptation) and VeFA (Vector-Based Feature Adaptation). Feature space
adaptation is inspired by the idea of effect equivalence modeling (EEM) of
downstream lurking variables causing distribution shifts, which posits that
unobserved factors can be represented as the total equivalent amount on
observed features. By compensating for the effects of downstream lurking
variables via a lightweight feature-level transformation, the pre-trained
representations can be preserved, which improves model generalization under
distribution shift. We evaluate LoRFA and VeFA versus LoRA on image
classification, NLU, and NLG, covering both standard fine-tuning metrics and
robustness. Feature space adaptation achieves comparable fine-tuning results
and consistently stronger robustness.

Abstract: In contrast to the classic formulation of partial monitoring, linear partial
monitoring can model infinite outcome spaces, while imposing a linear structure
on both the losses and the observations. This setting can be viewed as a
generalization of linear bandits where loss and feedback are decoupled in a
flexible manner. In this work, we address a nonstochastic (adversarial),
finite-actions version of the problem through a simple instance of the
exploration-by-optimization method that is amenable to efficient
implementation. We derive regret bounds that depend on the game structure in a
more transparent manner than previous theoretical guarantees for this paradigm.
Our bounds feature instance-specific quantities that reflect the degree of
alignment between observations and losses, and resemble known guarantees in the
stochastic setting. Notably, they achieve the standard $\sqrt{T}$ rate in easy
(locally observable) games and $T^{2/3}$ in hard (globally observable) games,
where $T$ is the time horizon. We instantiate these bounds in a selection of
old and new partial information settings subsumed by this model, and illustrate
that the achieved dependence on the game structure can be tight in interesting
cases.

Abstract: Integration of diverse data will be a pivotal step towards improving
scientific explorations in many disciplines. This work establishes a
vision-language model (VLM) that encodes videos with text input in order to
classify various behaviors of a mouse existing in and engaging with their
environment. Importantly, this model produces a behavioral vector over time for
each subject and for each session the subject undergoes. The output is a
valuable dataset that few programs are able to produce with as high accuracy
and with minimal user input. Specifically, we use the open-source Qwen2.5-VL
model and enhance its performance through prompts, in-context learning (ICL)
with labeled examples, and frame-level preprocessing. We found that each of
these methods contributes to improved classification, and that combining them
results in strong F1 scores across all behaviors, including rare classes like
freezing and fleeing, without any model fine-tuning. Overall, this model will
support interdisciplinary researchers studying mouse behavior by enabling them
to integrate diverse behavioral features, measured across multiple time points
and environments, into a comprehensive dataset that can address complex
research questions.

Abstract: Stochastic Natural Gradient Variational Inference (NGVI) is a widely used
method for approximating posterior distribution in probabilistic models.
Despite its empirical success and foundational role in variational inference,
its theoretical underpinnings remain limited, particularly in the case of
non-conjugate likelihoods. While NGVI has been shown to be a special instance
of Stochastic Mirror Descent, and recent work has provided convergence
guarantees using relative smoothness and strong convexity for conjugate models,
these results do not extend to the non-conjugate setting, where the variational
loss becomes non-convex and harder to analyze. In this work, we focus on
mean-field parameterization and advance the theoretical understanding of NGVI
in three key directions. First, we derive sufficient conditions under which the
variational loss satisfies relative smoothness with respect to a suitable
mirror map. Second, leveraging this structure, we propose a modified NGVI
algorithm incorporating non-Euclidean projections and prove its global
non-asymptotic convergence to a stationary point. Finally, under additional
structural assumptions about the likelihood, we uncover hidden convexity
properties of the variational loss and establish fast global convergence of
NGVI to a global optimum. These results provide new insights into the geometry
and convergence behavior of NGVI in challenging inference settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现多任务后训练中隐含的假设（所有任务贡献相似大小的梯度）在RL后训练中不成立，某些任务产生显著更大的梯度，导致优化偏差。

Method: 通过分析不同任务在RL后训练中的梯度大小和学习收益关系，研究梯度不平衡现象及其对优化的影响。

Conclusion: 需要警惕简单的数据集混合方法，呼吁未来研究开发基于梯度的校正方法来解决LLMs中的梯度不平衡问题。

Abstract: Multi-task post-training of large language models (LLMs) is typically
performed by mixing datasets from different tasks and optimizing them jointly.
This approach implicitly assumes that all tasks contribute gradients of similar
magnitudes; when this assumption fails, optimization becomes biased toward
large-gradient tasks. In this paper, however, we show that this assumption
fails in RL post-training: certain tasks produce significantly larger
gradients, thus biasing updates toward those tasks. Such gradient imbalance
would be justified only if larger gradients implied larger learning gains on
the tasks (i.e., larger performance improvements) -- but we find this is not
true. Large-gradient tasks can achieve similar or even much lower learning
gains than small-gradient ones. Further analyses reveal that these gradient
imbalances cannot be explained by typical training statistics such as training
rewards or advantages, suggesting that they arise from the inherent differences
between tasks. This cautions against naive dataset mixing and calls for future
work on principled gradient-level corrections for LLMs.

*Xiaoxing Ren,Nicola Bastianello,Thomas Parisini,Andreas A. Malikopoulos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种去中心化的actor-critic强化学习框架，通过局部策略更新减少多智能体系统中的通信负担，同时保持网络协调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体系统中通信受限的强化学习问题，降低通信开销同时维持智能体间的协调。

Method: 采用去中心化actor-critic框架，每个智能体在信息交换前进行多次局部策略和价值函数更新，价值函数由多层神经网络近似。

Result: 在马尔可夫采样下建立了有限时间收敛分析，样本复杂度为O(ε⁻³)，通信复杂度为O(ε⁻¹τ⁻¹)，其中τ为局部训练步数。

Conclusion: 该框架有效降低了通信负担，理论分析和数值实验验证了方法的有效性，最终误差界依赖于神经网络的近似质量。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of reinforcement learning in multi-agent
systems where communication among agents is limited. We develop a decentralized
actor-critic learning framework in which each agent performs several local
updates of its policy and value function, where the latter is approximated by a
multi-layer neural network, before exchanging information with its neighbors.
This local training strategy substantially reduces the communication burden
while maintaining coordination across the network. We establish finite-time
convergence analysis for the algorithm under Markov-sampling. Specifically, to
attain the $\varepsilon$-accurate stationary point, the sample complexity is of
order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-3})$ and the communication complexity is of
order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1}\tau^{-1})$, where tau denotes the number of
local training steps. We also show how the final error bound depends on the
neural network's approximation quality. Numerical experiments in a cooperative
control setting illustrate and validate the theoretical findings.

TL;DR: 提出ADGNN模型，通过主动扩散机制整合外部信息源，克服传统GNN的过平滑问题，实现真正的无限扩散。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于热扩散的GNN模拟被动热扩散，存在过平滑问题，节点特征会收敛到相同向量，限制了捕获全局图信息的能力。

Method: ADGNN通过整合多个外部信息源实现主动扩散，直接计算主动扩散迭代公式的闭式解，实现无限扩散。

Result: 在多个图任务中，ADGNN相比最先进的GNN模型显著提高了准确性和效率。

Conclusion: ADGNN能有效捕获全局图信息并保持节点独特性，解决了传统扩散方法的局限性。

Abstract: The analogy to heat diffusion has enhanced our understanding of information
flow in graphs and inspired the development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).
However, most diffusion-based GNNs emulate passive heat diffusion, which still
suffers from over-smoothing and limits their ability to capture global graph
information. Inspired by the heat death of the universe, which posits that
energy distribution becomes uniform over time in a closed system, we recognize
that, without external input, node representations in a graph converge to
identical feature vectors as diffusion progresses. To address this issue, we
propose the Active Diffusion-based Graph Neural Network (ADGNN). ADGNN achieves
active diffusion by integrating multiple external information sources that
dynamically influence the diffusion process, effectively overcoming the
over-smoothing problem. Furthermore, our approach realizes true infinite
diffusion by directly calculating the closed-form solution of the active
diffusion iterative formula. This allows nodes to preserve their unique
characteristics while efficiently gaining comprehensive insights into the
graph's global structure. We evaluate ADGNN against several state-of-the-art
GNN models across various graph tasks. The results demonstrate that ADGNN
significantly improves both accuracy and efficiency, highlighting its
effectiveness in capturing global graph information and maintaining node
distinctiveness.

Conclusion: 该框架在严重环境干扰下表现出鲁棒性，适用于网络物理系统中的安全智能导航。

Abstract: Data-driven inertial sequence learning has revolutionized navigation in
GPS-denied environments, offering superior odometric resolution compared to
traditional Bayesian methods. However, deep learning-based inertial tracking
systems remain vulnerable to privacy breaches that can expose sensitive
training data. \hl{Existing differential privacy solutions often compromise
model performance by introducing excessive noise, particularly in
high-frequency inertial measurements.} In this article, we propose ConvXformer,
a hybrid architecture that fuses ConvNeXt blocks with Transformer encoders in a
hierarchical structure for robust inertial navigation. We propose an efficient
differential privacy mechanism incorporating adaptive gradient clipping and
gradient-aligned noise injection (GANI) to protect sensitive information while
ensuring model performance. Our framework leverages truncated singular value
decomposition for gradient processing, enabling precise control over the
privacy-utility trade-off. Comprehensive performance evaluations on benchmark
datasets (OxIOD, RIDI, RoNIN) demonstrate that ConvXformer surpasses
state-of-the-art methods, achieving more than 40% improvement in positioning
accuracy while ensuring $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy guarantees. To
validate real-world performance, we introduce the Mech-IO dataset, collected
from the mechanical engineering building at KAIST, where intense magnetic
fields from industrial equipment induce significant sensor perturbations. This
demonstrated robustness under severe environmental distortions makes our
framework well-suited for secure and intelligent navigation in cyber-physical
systems.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) techniques have emerged as a powerful tool for
transferring expertise from complex teacher models to lightweight student
models, particularly beneficial for deploying high-performance models in
resource-constrained devices. This approach has been successfully applied to
graph neural networks (GNNs), harnessing their expressive capabilities to
generate node embeddings that capture structural and feature-related
information. In this study, we depart from the conventional KD approach by
exploring the potential of collaborative learning among GNNs. In the absence of
a pre-trained teacher model, we show that relatively simple and shallow GNN
architectures can synergetically learn efficient models capable of performing
better during inference, particularly in tackling multiple tasks. We propose a
collaborative learning framework where ensembles of student GNNs mutually teach
each other throughout the training process. We introduce an adaptive logit
weighting unit to facilitate efficient knowledge exchange among models and an
entropy enhancement technique to improve mutual learning. These components
dynamically empower the models to adapt their learning strategies during
training, optimizing their performance for downstream tasks. Extensive
experiments conducted on three datasets each for node and graph classification
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统近似遗忘方法作为单目标优化问题面临三个主要挑战：过度遗忘风险、缺乏细粒度控制以及缺乏全面评估权衡的指标。

Method: 提出CUP算法，采用梯度枢轴机制，通过单个直观的超参数'遗忘强度'来可控地导航整个帕累托前沿。

Result: 实验结果表明，CUP能够产生更优的帕累托最优解集，在各种视觉任务中持续优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 将机器遗忘重新定义为多目标优化问题，并通过CUP算法实现可控的遗忘过程，为解决遗忘效果与模型保真度之间的权衡提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of specific data from a
trained model. However, approximate unlearning methods, often formulated as a
single-objective optimization (SOO) problem, face a critical trade-off between
unlearning efficacy and model fidelity. This leads to three primary challenges:
the risk of over-forgetting, a lack of fine-grained control over the unlearning
process, and the absence of metrics to holistically evaluate the trade-off. To
address these issues, we reframe MU as a multi-objective optimization (MOO)
problem. We then introduce a novel algorithm, Controllable Unlearning by
Pivoting Gradient (CUP), which features a unique pivoting mechanism. Unlike
traditional MOO methods that converge to a single solution, CUP's mechanism is
designed to controllably navigate the entire Pareto frontier. This navigation
is governed by a single intuitive hyperparameter, the `unlearning intensity',
which allows for precise selection of a desired trade-off. To evaluate this
capability, we adopt the hypervolume indicator, a metric that captures both the
quality and diversity of the entire set of solutions an algorithm can generate.
Our experimental results demonstrate that CUP produces a superior set of
Pareto-optimal solutions, consistently outperforming existing methods across
various vision tasks.

Abstract: Infants discover categories, detect novelty, and adapt to new contexts
without supervision -- a challenge for current machine learning. We present a
brain-inspired perspective on configurations, a finite-resolution clustering
framework that uses a single resolution parameter and attraction-repulsion
dynamics to yield hierarchical organization, novelty sensitivity, and flexible
adaptation. To evaluate these properties, we introduce mheatmap, which provides
proportional heatmaps and a reassignment algorithm to fairly assess
multi-resolution and dynamic behavior. Across datasets, configurations are
competitive on standard clustering metrics, achieve 87% AUC in novelty
detection, and show 35% better stability during dynamic category evolution.
These results position configurations as a principled computational model of
early cognitive categorization and a step toward brain-inspired AI.

Conclusion: 语义世界模型能够继承预训练视觉语言模型的泛化和鲁棒性特性，为机器人决策规划提供了更有效的世界建模方法。

Abstract: Planning with world models offers a powerful paradigm for robotic control.
Conventional approaches train a model to predict future frames conditioned on
current frames and actions, which can then be used for planning. However, the
objective of predicting future pixels is often at odds with the actual planning
objective; strong pixel reconstruction does not always correlate with good
planning decisions. This paper posits that instead of reconstructing future
frames as pixels, world models only need to predict task-relevant semantic
information about the future. For such prediction the paper poses world
modeling as a visual question answering problem about semantic information in
future frames. This perspective allows world modeling to be approached with the
same tools underlying vision language models. Thus vision language models can
be trained as "semantic" world models through a supervised finetuning process
on image-action-text data, enabling planning for decision-making while
inheriting many of the generalization and robustness properties from the
pretrained vision-language models. The paper demonstrates how such a semantic
world model can be used for policy improvement on open-ended robotics tasks,
leading to significant generalization improvements over typical paradigms of
reconstruction-based action-conditional world modeling. Website available at

Motivation: 理解时间序列基础模型训练过程中各种设计选择如何影响模型质量，而不是简单地开发新模型并在基准测试中获胜。

Method: 使用理论分析和受控实证评估相结合的方法，研究补丁大小、嵌入选择、训练目标等设计选择如何导致模型在时间行为、几何结构等方面的隐式偏差。

Result: 识别了多种设计选择及其导致的隐式偏差，这些偏差可能直观或反直觉，取决于模型和数据的特性。通过异常值处理的案例研究展示了多个偏差如何复杂交互。

Conclusion: 研究结果对学习"苦涩教训"和构建时间序列基础模型具有重要意义，强调了理解训练过程设计选择影响的重要性。

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) are a class of potentially powerful,
general-purpose tools for time series forecasting and related temporal tasks,
but their behavior is strongly shaped by subtle inductive biases in their
design. Rather than developing a new model and claiming that it is better than
existing TSFMs, e.g., by winning on existing well-established benchmarks, our
objective is to understand how the various ``knobs'' of the training process
affect model quality. Using a mix of theory and controlled empirical
evaluation, we identify several design choices (patch size, embedding choice,
training objective, etc.) and show how they lead to implicit biases in
fundamental model properties (temporal behavior, geometric structure, how
aggressively or not the model regresses to the mean, etc.); and we show how
these biases can be intuitive or very counterintuitive, depending on properties
of the model and data. We also illustrate in a case study on outlier handling
how multiple biases can interact in complex ways; and we discuss implications
of our results for learning the bitter lesson and building TSFMs.

TL;DR: SPOT是一种新颖的强化学习方法，通过混合整数线性规划优化决策树策略，显著提高计算效率和可扩展性，同时保持策略的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险决策中需要可解释的强化学习策略，但在马尔可夫决策过程中优化决策树策略仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 将优化问题建模为混合整数线性规划，采用降维分支定界方法，将MDP动态与树结构约束解耦，实现高效并行搜索。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，SPOT实现了显著加速，可扩展到具有更多状态的大型MDP，生成紧凑可解释的决策树策略。

Conclusion: 该方法同时实现了可解释性和可扩展性，比现有方法快一个数量级地提供高质量策略。

Abstract: Interpretable reinforcement learning policies are essential for high-stakes
decision-making, yet optimizing decision tree policies in Markov Decision
Processes (MDPs) remains challenging. We propose SPOT, a novel method for
computing decision tree policies, which formulates the optimization problem as
a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). To enhance efficiency, we employ a
reduced-space branch-and-bound approach that decouples the MDP dynamics from
tree-structure constraints, enabling efficient parallel search. This
significantly improves runtime and scalability compared to previous methods.
Our approach ensures that each iteration yields the optimal decision tree.
Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that SPOT achieves
substantial speedup and scales to larger MDPs with a significantly higher
number of states. The resulting decision tree policies are interpretable and
compact, maintaining transparency without compromising performance. These
results demonstrate that our approach simultaneously achieves interpretability
and scalability, delivering high-quality policies an order of magnitude faster
than existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度强化学习虽然性能出色但缺乏可解释性，限制了对其策略行为的信任。现有SILVER框架仅限于低维、二元动作领域，需要扩展到更复杂的环境。

Method: 首先从图像观察中提取紧凑特征表示，执行SHAP特征归因，然后使用RL引导标签生成行为一致的边界数据集，最后训练决策树和回归函数等替代模型来解释RL策略的决策结构。

Result: 在两个Atari环境中使用三种深度RL算法进行评估，结果显示该方法在保持竞争性任务性能的同时，显著提高了透明度和人类对智能体行为的理解。

Conclusion: 这项工作通过将SILVER转变为可扩展且行为感知的框架，推动了可解释强化学习在高维多动作设置中的发展。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) achieves remarkable performance but lacks
interpretability, limiting trust in policy behavior. The existing SILVER
framework (Li, Siddique, and Cao 2025) explains RL policy via Shapley-based
regression but remains restricted to low-dimensional, binary-action domains. We
propose SILVER with RL-guided labeling, an enhanced variant that extends SILVER
to multi-action and high-dimensional environments by incorporating the RL
policy's own action outputs into the boundary points identification. Our method
first extracts compact feature representations from image observations,
performs SHAP-based feature attribution, and then employs RL-guided labeling to
generate behaviorally consistent boundary datasets. Surrogate models, such as
decision trees and regression-based functions, are subsequently trained to
interpret RL policy's decision structure. We evaluate the proposed framework on
two Atari environments using three deep RL algorithms and conduct human-subject
study to assess the clarity and trustworthiness of the derived interpretable
policy. Results show that our approach maintains competitive task performance
while substantially improving transparency and human understanding of agent
behavior. This work advances explainable RL by transforming SILVER into a
scalable and behavior-aware framework for interpreting deep RL agents in
high-dimensional, multi-action settings.

Conclusion: GraMixC作为即插即用模块，能够有效提取和利用配置信息，显著提升下游任务的性能，为无监督学习提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Humans possess an innate ability to group objects by similarity, a cognitive
mechanism that clustering algorithms aim to emulate. Recent advances in
community detection have enabled the discovery of configurations -- valid
hierarchical clusterings across multiple resolution scales -- without requiring
labeled data. In this paper, we formally characterize these configurations and
identify similar emergent structures in register tokens within Vision
Transformers. Unlike register tokens, configurations exhibit lower redundancy
and eliminate the need for ad hoc selection. They can be learned through
unsupervised or self-supervised methods, yet their selection or composition
remains specific to the downstream task and input. Building on these insights,
we introduce GraMixC, a plug-and-play module that extracts configurations,
aligns them using our Reverse Merge/Split (RMS) technique, and fuses them via
attention heads before forwarding them to any downstream predictor. On the DSN1
16S rRNA cultivation-media prediction task, GraMixC improves the R2 score from
0.6 to 0.9 across multiple methods, setting a new state of the art. We further
validate GraMixC on standard tabular benchmarks, where it consistently
outperforms single-resolution and static-feature baselines.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at learning from structured data, yet
fairness in regression tasks remains underexplored. Existing approaches mainly
target classification and representation-level debiasing, which cannot fully
address the continuous nature of node-level regression. We propose FnRGNN, a
fairness-aware in-processing framework for GNN-based node regression that
applies interventions at three levels: (i) structure-level edge reweighting,
(ii) representation-level alignment via MMD, and (iii) prediction-level
normalization through Sinkhorn-based distribution matching. This multi-level
strategy ensures robust fairness under complex graph topologies. Experiments on
four real-world datasets demonstrate that FnRGNN reduces group disparities
without sacrificing performance. Code is available at

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to
Transformers for sequence modeling, offering superior scalability through
recurrent structures. However, their training remains costly and the ecosystem
around them is far less mature than that of Transformers. Moreover, the
structural heterogeneity between SSMs and Transformers makes it challenging to
efficiently distill knowledge from pretrained attention models. In this work,
we propose Cross-architecture distillation via Attention Bridge (CAB), a novel
data-efficient distillation framework that efficiently transfers attention
knowledge from Transformer teachers to state-space student models. Unlike
conventional knowledge distillation that transfers knowledge only at the output
level, CAB enables token-level supervision via a lightweight bridge and
flexible layer-wise alignment, improving both efficiency and transferability.
We further introduce flexible layer-wise alignment strategies to accommodate
architectural discrepancies between teacher and student. Extensive experiments
across vision and language domains demonstrate that our method consistently
improves the performance of state-space models, even under limited training
data, outperforming both standard and cross-architecture distillation methods.
Our findings suggest that attention-based knowledge can be efficiently
transferred to recurrent models, enabling rapid utilization of Transformer
expertise for building a stronger SSM community.

Conclusion: 高斯蒸馏是一种有效的分布蒸馏方法，能够压缩教师集成同时保持不确定性量化能力，适用于实际部署场景

Abstract: Deep ensembles deliver state-of-the-art, reliable uncertainty quantification,
but their heavy computational and memory requirements hinder their practical
deployments to real applications such as on-device AI. Knowledge distillation
compresses an ensemble into small student models, but existing techniques
struggle to preserve uncertainty partly because reducing the size of DNNs
typically results in variation reduction. To resolve this limitation, we
introduce a new method of distribution distillation (i.e. compressing a teacher
ensemble into a student distribution instead of a student ensemble) called
Gaussian distillation, which estimates the distribution of a teacher ensemble
through a special Gaussian process called the deep latent factor model (DLF) by
treating each member of the teacher ensemble as a realization of a certain
stochastic process. The mean and covariance functions in the DLF model are
estimated stably by using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. By using
multiple benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed Gaussian
distillation outperforms existing baselines. In addition, we illustrate that
Gaussian distillation works well for fine-tuning of language models and
distribution shift problems.

the preference optimization based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) for producing
functionally correct Verilog code. In this paper, we propose Signal-Aware
Learning for Verilog code generation (QiMeng-SALV) by leveraging code segments
of functionally correct output signal to optimize RL training. Considering
Verilog code specifies the structural interconnection of hardware gates and
wires so that different output signals are independent, the key insight of
QiMeng-SALV is to extract verified signal-aware implementations in partially
incorrect modules, so as to enhance the extraction of meaningful functional
rewards. Roughly, we verify the functional correctness of signals in generated
module by comparing with that of reference module in the training data. Then
abstract syntax tree (AST) is employed to identify signal-aware code segments
which can provide meaningful functional rewards from erroneous modules.
Finally, we introduce signal-aware DPO which is optimized on the correct
signal-level code segments, thereby preventing noise and interference from
incorrect signals. The proposed QiMeng-SALV underscores the paradigm shift from
conventional module-level to fine-grained signal-level optimization in Verilog
code generation, addressing the issue of insufficient functional rewards.
Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
on VerilogEval and RTLLM, with a 7B parameter model matching the performance of
the DeepSeek v3 671B model and significantly outperforming the leading
open-source model CodeV trained on the same dataset. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Loopholing机制，通过确定性潜路径保留分布信息，解决了离散扩散模型在采样后信息崩溃的问题，显著提升了非自回归文本生成的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散扩散模型在并行解码方面有优势，但存在采样墙问题：一旦进行类别采样，丰富的分布信息就会崩溃为one-hot向量，无法在步骤间传播，导致后续步骤只能使用有限信息。

Method: 引入Loopholing机制，通过确定性潜路径保留分布信息，构建Loopholing离散扩散模型（LDDMs），使用自条件策略进行高效训练。

Result: LDDMs将生成困惑度降低了高达61%，缩小了与自回归模型的差距（在某些情况下甚至超越），生成更连贯的文本。在推理任务中，在Countdown和Game of 24等算术基准上表现更好。

Conclusion: Loopholing机制缓解了空闲步骤和振荡问题，为高质量非自回归文本生成提供了可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models offer a promising alternative to autoregressive
generation through parallel decoding, but they suffer from a sampling wall:
once categorical sampling occurs, rich distributional information collapses
into one-hot vectors and cannot be propagated across steps, forcing subsequent
steps to operate with limited information. To mitigate this problem, we
introduce Loopholing, a novel and simple mechanism that preserves this
information via a deterministic latent pathway, leading to Loopholing Discrete
Diffusion Models (LDDMs). Trained efficiently with a self-conditioning
strategy, LDDMs achieve substantial gains-reducing generative perplexity by up
to 61% over prior baselines, closing (and in some cases surpassing) the gap
with autoregressive models, and producing more coherent text. Applied to
reasoning tasks, LDDMs also improve performance on arithmetic benchmarks such
as Countdown and Game of 24. These results also indicate that loopholing
mitigates idle steps and oscillations, providing a scalable path toward
high-quality non-autoregressive text generation.

Motivation: 传统物种分布监测方法覆盖范围有限且不完整，需要更准确的方法来评估环境影响和制定保护策略。

Method: 应用深度学习和数据插补技术，采用数据平衡、特征选择和多模态集成模型（结合土地覆盖、NDVI等环境变量），融合图像和表格数据。

Result: 数据平衡使蛙类计数任务的MAE从189降至29；多模态集成模型优于单一模型，在未见区域表现稳健；融合数据方法在栖息地分类中达到84.9%准确率和0.90 AUC。

Conclusion: 多模态学习和数据预处理技术（如平衡和插补）能够显著改善生态预测模型，特别是在数据稀疏或不完整的情况下，有助于实现更精确和可扩展的生物多样性监测。

Abstract: Monitoring species distribution is vital for conservation efforts, enabling
the assessment of environmental impacts and the development of effective
preservation strategies. Traditional data collection methods, including citizen
science, offer valuable insights but remain limited in coverage and
completeness. Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) helps address these gaps by
using occurrence data and environmental variables to predict species presence
across large regions. In this study, we enhance SDM accuracy for frogs (Anura)
by applying deep learning and data imputation techniques using data from the
"EY - 2022 Biodiversity Challenge." Our experiments show that data balancing
significantly improved model performance, reducing the Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) from 189 to 29 in frog counting tasks. Feature selection identified key
environmental factors influencing occurrence, optimizing inputs while
maintaining predictive accuracy. The multimodal ensemble model, integrating
land cover, NDVI, and other environmental inputs, outperformed individual
models and showed robust generalization across unseen regions. The fusion of
image and tabular data improved both frog counting and habitat classification,
achieving 84.9% accuracy with an AUC of 0.90. This study highlights the
potential of multimodal learning and data preprocessing techniques such as
balancing and imputation to improve predictive ecological modeling when data
are sparse or incomplete, contributing to more precise and scalable
biodiversity monitoring.

Abstract: Machine learning models are essential for decision-making and risk
assessment, requiring highly reliable predictions in terms of both
discrimination and calibration. While calibration often receives less
attention, it is crucial for critical decisions, such as those in clinical
predictions. We introduce a novel calibration pipeline that leverages an
ensemble of calibration functions trained on clusters of learned
representations of the input samples to enhance overall calibration. This
approach not only improves the calibration score of various methods from 82.28%
up to 100% but also introduces a unique matching metric that ensures model
selection optimizes both discrimination and calibration. Our generic scheme
adapts to any underlying representation, clustering, calibration methods and
metric, offering flexibility and superior performance across commonly used
calibration methods.

Conclusion: Ring-linear模型系列通过混合注意力架构和高效算子库，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了推理成本，为长上下文推理提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: In this technical report, we present the Ring-linear model series,
specifically including Ring-mini-linear-2.0 and Ring-flash-linear-2.0.
Ring-mini-linear-2.0 comprises 16B parameters and 957M activations, while
Ring-flash-linear-2.0 contains 104B parameters and 6.1B activations. Both
models adopt a hybrid architecture that effectively integrates linear attention
and softmax attention, significantly reducing I/O and computational overhead in
long-context inference scenarios. Compared to a 32 billion parameter dense
model, this series reduces inference cost to 1/10, and compared to the original
Ring series, the cost is also reduced by over 50%. Furthermore, through
systematic exploration of the ratio between different attention mechanisms in
the hybrid architecture, we have identified the currently optimal model
structure. Additionally, by leveraging our self-developed high-performance FP8
operator library-linghe, overall training efficiency has been improved by 50%.
Benefiting from the high alignment between the training and inference engine
operators, the models can undergo long-term, stable, and highly efficient
optimization during the reinforcement learning phase, consistently maintaining
SOTA performance across multiple challenging complex reasoning benchmarks.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了时间序列基础模型(TSFMs)的预测形式对实际应用价值的影响，指出虽然TSFMs在预测精度上表现良好，但预测形式(点预测、分位数预测、参数预测或轨迹集成)决定了其支持的运营任务类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时间序列基础模型主要关注预测精度，但忽略了预测形式对实际运营任务支持的重要性。许多运营任务需要轨迹集成预测来保持时间依赖性，而大多数TSFMs仅产生点预测或参数预测。

Method: 通过调查近期TSFMs，分析不同预测形式之间的可转换性，证明边际分布无法确定路径依赖事件概率，并将六种基本预测任务映射到最小充分预测类型。

Result: 研究发现三分之二的TSFMs仅产生点预测或参数预测，而轨迹集成可以通过边际化转换为更简单的形式，但反向转换需要施加时间依赖性。建立了任务对齐的评估框架。

Conclusion: 预测类型而非精度决定了实际效用，当预测形式与运营任务需求不匹配时，即使高精度预测也可能缺乏实用价值。

Abstract: Time-series foundation models (TSFMs) achieve strong forecast accuracy, yet
accuracy alone does not determine practical value. The form of a forecast --
point, quantile, parametric, or trajectory ensemble -- fundamentally constrains
which operational tasks it can support. We survey recent TSFMs and find that
two-thirds produce only point or parametric forecasts, while many operational
tasks require trajectory ensembles that preserve temporal dependence. We
establish when forecast types can be converted and when they cannot: trajectory
ensembles convert to simpler forms via marginalization without additional
assumptions, but the reverse requires imposing temporal dependence through
copulas or conformal methods. We prove that marginals cannot determine
path-dependent event probabilities -- infinitely many joint distributions share
identical marginals but yield different answers to operational questions. We
map six fundamental forecasting tasks to minimal sufficient forecast types and
provide a task-aligned evaluation framework. Our analysis clarifies when
forecast type, not accuracy, differentiates practical utility.

Result: 计算实验表明，提出的分支智能体在四个标准MILP基准测试中优于先前最先进的强化学习智能体。

Conclusion: BBMDP提供了一个原则性的MDP公式，能够有效学习分支定界中的变量选择策略，并在实验中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a powerful framework used to
address a wide range of NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems, often
solved by Branch and Bound (B&B). A key factor influencing the performance of
B&B solvers is the variable selection heuristic governing branching decisions.
Recent contributions have sought to adapt reinforcement learning (RL)
algorithms to the B&B setting to learn optimal branching policies, through
Markov Decision Processes (MDP) inspired formulations, and ad hoc convergence
theorems and algorithms. In this work, we introduce BBMDP, a principled vanilla
MDP formulation for variable selection in B&B, allowing to leverage a broad
range of RL algorithms for the purpose of learning optimal B\&B heuristics.
Computational experiments validate our model empirically, as our branching
agent outperforms prior state-of-the-art RL agents on four standard MILP
benchmarks.

Conclusion: Scalable LinUCB算法成功解决了传统LinUCB的计算和内存瓶颈，为大规模推荐系统提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Linear contextual bandits, especially LinUCB, are widely used in recommender
systems. However, its training, inference, and memory costs grow with feature
dimensionality and the size of the action space. The key bottleneck becomes the
need to update, invert and store a design matrix that absorbs contextual
information from interaction history. In this paper, we introduce Scalable
LinUCB, the algorithm that enables fast and memory efficient operations with
the inverse regularized design matrix. We achieve this through a dynamical
low-rank parametrization of its inverse Cholesky-style factors. We derive
numerically stable rank-1 and batched updates that maintain the inverse without
directly forming the entire matrix. To control memory growth, we employ a
projector-splitting integrator for dynamical low-rank approximation, yielding
average per-step update cost $O(dr)$ and memory $O(dr)$ for approximation rank
$r$. Inference complexity of the suggested algorithm is $O(dr)$ per action
evaluation. Experiments on recommender system datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm.

<details>

Motivation: 许多系统会随时间老化或退化，但传感器数据中可能没有直接的"年龄"信息。需要从现有传感器数据中发现能代表系统老化趋势的潜在代理特征。

Method: 使用精心定义的语法生成候选公式，通过优化这些公式的单调性（定义为时间与候选公式之间的绝对Spearman秩相关系数），评估和选择最优的代理特征。

Result: 在人工生成数据集和两个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，该方法能将单调性较低的单传感器特征组合成单调性高的潜在特征。在InfraWatch结构健康监测项目中，两个单传感器特征（Spearman's ρ分别为0.13和0.09）被组合成一个代理特征，Spearman's ρ达到0.95。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够发现可解释的公式，这些公式可以作为系统"年龄"的有效代理特征，即使单个传感器的单调性很低。

Abstract: Many systems in our world age, degrade or otherwise move slowly but steadily
in a certain direction. When monitoring such systems by means of sensors, one
often assumes that some form of `age' is latently present in the data, but
perhaps the available sensors do not readily provide this useful information.
The task that we study in this paper is to extract potential proxies for this
`age' from the available multi-variate time series without having clear data on
what `age' actually is. We argue that when we find a sensor, or more likely
some discovered function of the available sensors, that is sufficiently
monotonic, that function can act as the proxy we are searching for. Using a
carefully defined grammar and optimising the resulting equations in terms of
monotonicity, defined as the absolute Spearman's Rank Correlation between time
and the candidate formula, the proposed approach generates a set of candidate
features which are then fitted and assessed on monotonicity. The proposed
system is evaluated against an artificially generated dataset and two
real-world datasets. In all experiments, we show that the system is able to
combine sensors with low individual monotonicity into latent features with high
monotonicity. For the real-world dataset of InfraWatch, a structural health
monitoring project, we show that two features with individual absolute
Spearman's $\rho$ values of $0.13$ and $0.09$ can be combined into a proxy with
an absolute Spearman's $\rho$ of $0.95$. This demonstrates that our proposed
method can find interpretable equations which can serve as a proxy for the
`age' of the system.

TL;DR: ADAligner是一个动态、质量感知的图文本对齐框架，能够根据监督质量在表达性多对多和保守一对一目标之间动态调整，解决了现有图文本对齐方法在处理多对多关系和噪声监督时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CLIP风格图文本对齐方法存在两个关键限制：假设节点和文本之间存在严格的一对一对应关系，忽略了现实世界图中固有的多对多关系；依赖静态对齐目标，无法适应不同的数据质量，在噪声监督下变得脆弱。

Method: ADAligner通过实时估计批次级别的对齐可靠性并相应调整优化策略，在监督干净时促进软性的子图级别多对多对齐，在噪声环境下通过动态过滤低置信度对来强调可靠的一对一对齐。

Result: 在九个不同的TAG数据集上的综合实验表明，ADAligner在零样本/少样本节点分类、链接预测和跨模态检索任务上始终优于先前的图文本对齐方法，在噪声监督下保持强鲁棒性，并比多模态基线加速预训练约2到3倍。

Conclusion: ADAligner为现实世界网络环境中的图文本表示学习建立了一个可扩展且可靠的基础，通过动态质量感知机制有效解决了图文本对齐中的核心困境。

Abstract: Pre-training Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) on text-attributed graphs (TAGs)
is central to web-scale applications such as search, recommendation, and
knowledge discovery. However, existing CLIP-style graph-text aligners face two
key limitations: they assume strict one-to-one correspondences between nodes
and texts, overlooking the inherent many-to-many relations in real-world
graphs; and they rely on static alignment objectives that cannot adapt to
varying data quality, making them brittle under noisy supervision. Together,
these limitations expose a core dilemma: embracing expressive many-to-many
alignment amplifies noise, while reverting to strict one-to-one strategies
sacrifices semantic diversity and fails to handle inherently mismatched pairs.
To address these challenges, we propose ADAligner, a dynamic, quality-aware
graph-text alignment framework that dynamically adjusts between expressive
many-to-many and conservative one-to-one objectives according to supervision
quality. ADAligner estimates batch-level alignment reliability in real time and
adapts its optimization accordingly, promoting soft, subgraph-level
many-to-many alignment when supervision is clean, while emphasizing reliable
one-to-one alignment by dynamically filtering low-confidence pairs under noise.
Theoretically, we prove that this dynamic mechanism forms a stable negative
feedback process, ensuring convergence and robustness. Comprehensive
experiments on nine diverse TAG datasets demonstrate that ADAligner
consistently outperforms prior graph-text aligners on zero-/few-shot node
classification, link prediction and cross-modal retrieval tasks. It maintains
strong robustness under noisy supervision and accelerates pre-training by
approximately 2 to 3 times compared to multimodal baselines, establishing a
scalable and reliable foundation for graph-text representation learning in
real-world web environments.

Motivation: 现有SVD方法对整个参数矩阵统一处理，忽略了SVD近似误差在不同矩阵部分差异显著的问题，导致压缩效果不佳。

Method: CPSVD方法识别并直接保留高分解误差的矩阵列，仅对低分解误差列应用SVD，精确确定两种策略的最优平衡点，并自适应分配非均匀压缩率。

Result: 大量实验表明CPSVD在零样本任务上持续优于最先进的SVD压缩方法，获得更低的困惑度和更高的准确率。

Conclusion: CPSVD通过智能矩阵分割和自适应压缩率分配，显著提升了SVD-based LLM压缩的性能。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) faces a critical
bottleneck in their immense size, necessitating efficient compression
techniques. While Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a promising approach,
existing SVD-based methods treat the entire parameter matrix uniformly,
overlooking that SVD approximation errors vary significantly across different
matrix parts, which often leads to suboptimal compression. To address this, we
propose \textbf{C}olumn-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{S}ingular \textbf{V}alue
\textbf{D}ecomposition (CPSVD), a novel method that refines SVD-based LLM
compression by intelligently segmenting the parameter matrix. Unlike
traditional SVD, CPSVD identifies and directly preserves matrix columns with
high decomposition errors, applying SVD only to columns with low decomposition
errors, while precisely determining the optimal balance point between these two
strategies to minimize error. Furthermore, leveraging the inherent
heterogeneity in decomposition errors across different matrices within an LLM,
CPSVD adaptively allocates non-uniform compression rates to modules within that
layer, while adhering to a target layer-wise compression ratio, thereby further
enhancing compression performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPSVD
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SVD-based LLM compression methods,
achieving lower perplexity and higher accuracy on zero-shot tasks.

<details>

Motivation: 现有SVD压缩方法存在局限性：启发式算法搜索空间受限，基于掩码的训练难以高效捕捉奇异值谱与可训练参数的关系，且忽视了增益函数在压缩比为1时的非光滑特性，导致训练陷入局部最优。

Method: ARA方法包含：(1)专用掩码设计，实现保留秩与可训练参数之间的高效映射和更新；(2)额外损失函数，引导参数选择朝向全局最优解。

Result: 在LLaMA2-7B模型上，80%压缩比下，WikiText2困惑度从8.38降至6.42，零样本任务平均准确率相比均匀压缩提升9.72个百分点。

Conclusion: ARA方法在基于SVD的LLM压缩中实现了最先进的秩分配性能，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: In the field of large language model (LLM) compression, singular value
decomposition (SVD) is a widely studied and adopted low-rank decomposition
technique. Since SVD operates exclusively on linear modules, and these modules
in LLMs are separated by nonlinear components, SVD can only be applied
independently to each linear module. Under a global compression ratio
constraint, determining the appropriate rank for different linear modules
becomes a critical problem. Existing approaches, such as heuristic algorithms
and mask-based training, have made progress in addressing this challenge.
However, these methods still suffer from several limitations: heuristic
algorithms explore the solution space within restricted regions, while
mask-based training struggles to efficiently capture the relationship between
singular value spectra and trainable parameters. More importantly, current
methods overlook the key property that the gain function is non-smooth at a
compression ratio of 1, which often leads the training process to suboptimal
local minima. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive Rank Allocation
(ARA) method. Specifically, (1) ARA introduces a dedicated mask design that
enables efficient mapping and updating between retained ranks and trainable
parameters; and (2) it employs an additional loss function to guide parameter
selection toward globally optimal solutions. Experimental results demonstrate
that ARA achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the LLaMA2-7B model with a
80\% compression ratio, ARA reduces perplexity on WikiText2 from 8.38 to 6.42
and improves average zero-shot task accuracy by 9.72 percentage points compared
with uniform compression. These results highlight the effectiveness of our
method for rank allocation in SVD-based LLM compression.

Conclusion: IFeF-PINN方法能有效克服频谱偏差，显著提高高频PDE的近似精度，在频域上实现改进的逼近效果

Abstract: Spectral bias, the tendency of neural networks to learn low-frequency
features first, is a well-known issue with many training algorithms for
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). To overcome this issue, we propose
IFeF-PINN, an algorithm for iterative training of PINNs with Fourier-enhanced
features. The key idea is to enrich the latent space using high-frequency
components through Random Fourier Features. This creates a two-stage training
problem: (i) estimate a basis in the feature space, and (ii) perform regression
to determine the coefficients of the enhanced basis functions. For an
underlying linear model, it is shown that the latter problem is convex, and we
prove that the iterative training scheme converges. Furthermore, we empirically
establish that Random Fourier Features enhance the expressive capacity of the
network, enabling accurate approximation of high-frequency PDEs. Through
extensive numerical evaluation on classical benchmark problems, the superior
performance of our method over state-of-the-art algorithms is shown, and the

### [178] [FairNet: Dynamic Fairness Correction without Performance Loss via Contrastive Conditional LoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19421)
*Songqi Zhou,Zeyuan Liu,Benben Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FairNet是一个动态实例级公平性校正框架，通过偏置检测器和条件低秩适配器选择性激活公平性校正，解决现有方法在性能权衡、静态策略和数据稀疏性方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去偏方法往往牺牲模型性能、依赖静态校正策略、难以处理数据稀疏问题（特别是少数群体），且在敏感属性使用上存在不足——要么过度依赖完整标注，要么完全忽略这些属性。

Method: FairNet整合偏置检测器和条件低秩适配器(LoRA)，仅对检测为偏置的实例激活公平性校正机制。采用新的对比损失函数训练LoRA模块，最小化不同敏感群体间的类内表示差异，有效解决少数群体欠拟合问题。

Result: 理论分析表明，在偏置检测器具有中等TPR/FPR条件下，FairNet能提升最差群体性能而不降低整体性能，甚至可能带来轻微性能提升。在多种视觉和语言基准测试中的实证评估验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: FairNet框架能灵活处理完整、部分或完全缺失的敏感属性标签场景，为机器学习公平性问题提供了有效的动态解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in machine learning models is a critical challenge.
Existing debiasing methods often compromise performance, rely on static
correction strategies, and struggle with data sparsity, particularly within
minority groups. Furthermore, their utilization of sensitive attributes is
often suboptimal, either depending excessively on complete attribute labeling
or disregarding these attributes entirely. To overcome these limitations, we
propose FairNet, a novel framework for dynamic, instance-level fairness
correction. FairNet integrates a bias detector with conditional low-rank
adaptation (LoRA), which enables selective activation of the fairness
correction mechanism exclusively for instances identified as biased, and
thereby preserve performance on unbiased instances. A key contribution is a new
contrastive loss function for training the LoRA module, specifically designed
to minimize intra-class representation disparities across different sensitive
groups and effectively address underfitting in minority groups. The FairNet
framework can flexibly handle scenarios with complete, partial, or entirely
absent sensitive attribute labels. Theoretical analysis confirms that, under
moderate TPR/FPR for the bias detector, FairNet can enhance the performance of
the worst group without diminishing overall model performance, and potentially
yield slight performance improvements. Comprehensive empirical evaluations
across diverse vision and language benchmarks validate the effectiveness of
FairNet.

*Kemou Li,Qizhou Wang,Yue Wang,Fengpeng Li,Jun Liu,Bo Han,Jiantao Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的语言模型遗忘方法，通过引导框架直接对抗遗忘过程中的"挤压效应"，实现了更彻底的遗忘效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遗忘方法依赖梯度上升来降低目标响应的概率，但会导致概率质量重新分布到高似然区域，产生语义相关的重述，造成虚假遗忘。

Method: 提出引导框架，将挤压效应与模型自身高置信度生成相关联，通过同时抑制目标响应和模型信念来对抗挤压效应。BS-T衰减高概率词元，BS-S移除整个高置信度生成。

Result: 在多样化基准测试和多种模型家族上的广泛实验证实了该方法的有效性，实现了更彻底的遗忘同时保持实用性。

Conclusion: 通过直接针对挤压效应并利用模型信念，提出的引导框架能够实现更全面和真实的遗忘效果。

Abstract: Large language models trained on vast corpora inherently risk memorizing
sensitive or harmful content, which may later resurface in their outputs.
Prevailing unlearning methods generally rely on gradient ascent and its
variants to lower the probability of specific target responses. However, we
find that this strategy induces a critical side effect: probability mass is
redistributed into high-likelihood regions, often corresponding to semantically
related rephrasings of the targets. We refer to this as the squeezing effect,
which explains why many methods yield merely spurious unlearning, a problem
further obscured by automated metrics (e.g., ROUGE, truth ratio) that misreport
actual success. To address this, we propose a bootstrapping (BS) framework that
explicitly links the squeezing effect with the model's own high-confidence
generations, namely its model beliefs. Since model beliefs inherently capture
the very high-likelihood regions where probability mass is squeezed,
incorporating them into the unlearning objective directly counters the
squeezing effect. By jointly suppressing both target responses and model
beliefs, BS-T (token) attenuates high-probability tokens, whereas BS-S
(sequence) removes entire high-confidence generations, together achieving more
thorough forgetting while preserving utility. Extensive experiments across
diverse benchmarks with various model families confirm the effectiveness of our
approach.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的贝叶斯元学习方法——神经变分丢弃过程(NVDPs)，通过任务特定的dropout建模条件后验分布，在少样本学习中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学习推断条件后验模型是鲁棒元学习的关键步骤，需要处理功能模糊性和不确定性的方法。

Method: 使用低秩伯努利专家元模型进行内存高效映射，基于任务特定dropout快速重新配置共享神经网络，采用条件先验优化变分推断。

Result: 在1D随机回归、图像修复和分类等少样本学习任务中，NVDPs相比其他元学习方法表现出优异性能。

Conclusion: NVDPs能够稳健地近似任务特定的dropout率，有效处理广泛的功能模糊性和不确定性。

Abstract: Learning to infer the conditional posterior model is a key step for robust
meta-learning. This paper presents a new Bayesian meta-learning approach called
Neural Variational Dropout Processes (NVDPs). NVDPs model the conditional
posterior distribution based on a task-specific dropout; a low-rank product of
Bernoulli experts meta-model is utilized for a memory-efficient mapping of
dropout rates from a few observed contexts. It allows for a quick
reconfiguration of a globally learned and shared neural network for new tasks
in multi-task few-shot learning. In addition, NVDPs utilize a novel prior
conditioned on the whole task data to optimize the conditional \textit{dropout}
posterior in the amortized variational inference. Surprisingly, this enables
the robust approximation of task-specific dropout rates that can deal with a
wide range of functional ambiguities and uncertainties. We compared the
proposed method with other meta-learning approaches in the few-shot learning
tasks such as 1D stochastic regression, image inpainting, and classification.
The results show the excellent performance of NVDPs.

TL;DR: 重新检验Jones等人(2022)提出的修正普适性假设，发现对抗鲁棒模型在特定设置下确实具有高表示相似性，但预测行为并未随鲁棒性增强而收敛，不支持严格普适性概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证对抗鲁棒模型是否具有普适性特征，即不同模型在相同任务上是否会收敛到相似的表示和预测行为。

Method: 在不同数据集上测试Jones等人的修正普适性假设，分析表示相似性和预测行为，并尝试通过重新训练分类器来改善预测一致性。

Result: 在特定设置下验证了高表示相似性，但预测行为在不同数据集上不一致，且不随鲁棒性增强而收敛。重新训练分类器可以改善预测一致性。

Conclusion: 神经网络在特定设置下具有部分普适性，但不支持严格普适性概念，预测行为的不一致性主要源于分类层。

Abstract: The modified universality hypothesis proposed by Jones et al. (2022) suggests
that adversarially robust models trained for a given task are highly similar.
We revisit the hypothesis and test its generality. While we verify Jones' main
claim of high representational similarity in specific settings, results are not
consistent across different datasets. We also discover that predictive behavior
does not converge with increasing robustness and thus is not universal. We find
that differing predictions originate in the classification layer, but show that
more universal predictive behavior can be achieved with simple retraining of
the classifiers. Overall, our work points towards partial universality of
neural networks in specific settings and away from notions of strict
universality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: g-DPO通过序列空间聚类和分组近似方法解决了DPO在蛋白质语言模型训练中的可扩展性问题，在保持性能的同时显著提升了训练速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准DPO方法在蛋白质工程中面临可扩展性瓶颈：训练对的数量随标记序列数量呈二次方增长，导致训练时间过长，限制了在大数据集上的应用。

Method: g-DPO框架包含两个关键技术：(1) 使用序列空间聚类来修剪冗余训练对，同时保留训练信号；(2) 通过基于分组的近似方法来分摊似然计算的开销。

Result: 在三个蛋白质工程任务中，g-DPO保持了与标准DPO在计算模拟和体外实验中统计上无法区分的性能，同时收敛速度提高了1.8到3.7倍，且随着数据集规模增大，加速效果更明显。

Conclusion: g-DPO成功解决了DPO的可扩展性问题，为蛋白质语言模型的大规模实验设计对齐提供了高效的训练框架。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is an effective approach for aligning
protein language models with experimental design goals. However, DPO faces a
scalability bottleneck: the number of possible training pairs grows
quadratically with the number of labeled sequences, leading to prohibitive
training times even for modestly sized datasets. We introduce g-DPO, a
framework that (i) uses sequence space clustering to prune redundant pairs
while preserving training signal, and (ii) amortizes likelihood computations
with group-based approximations. Across three protein engineering tasks, g-DPO
maintains in-silico and in-vitro performance that is statistically
indistinguishable from standard DPO, while converging 1.8 to 3.7 times faster,
with greater gains expected as the size of the dataset increases.

Motivation: 随着AI系统接近危险能力水平，传统安全案例不足，需要替代方法来确保安全。思维链监控可能同时支持控制和可信度安全案例。

Method: 提出两部分安全案例框架：1) 证明模型无思维链时缺乏危险能力；2) 确保思维链启用的危险能力可被监控检测。系统分析监控性威胁（神经语言和编码推理），评估保持思维链忠实性的技术，探索从非监控思维链提取监控思维链的可能性。

Result: 建立了预测市场来评估思维链监控安全案例可行性的关键技术里程碑预测。

Conclusion: 思维链监控为构建AI安全案例提供了有前景的路线图，特别是在传统安全案例不足的背景下，需要进一步研究解决监控性威胁和确保思维链忠实性。

Abstract: As AI systems approach dangerous capability levels where inability safety
cases become insufficient, we need alternative approaches to ensure safety.
This paper presents a roadmap for constructing safety cases based on
chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring in reasoning models and outlines our research
agenda. We argue that CoT monitoring might support both control and
trustworthiness safety cases. We propose a two-part safety case: (1)
establishing that models lack dangerous capabilities when operating without
their CoT, and (2) ensuring that any dangerous capabilities enabled by a CoT
are detectable by CoT monitoring. We systematically examine two threats to
monitorability: neuralese and encoded reasoning, which we categorize into three
forms (linguistic drift, steganography, and alien reasoning) and analyze their
potential drivers. We evaluate existing and novel techniques for maintaining
CoT faithfulness. For cases where models produce non-monitorable reasoning, we
explore the possibility of extracting a monitorable CoT from a non-monitorable
CoT. To assess the viability of CoT monitoring safety cases, we establish
prediction markets to aggregate forecasts on key technical milestones
influencing their feasibility.

Conclusion: INPO框架通过减缓发散速度和改善模型效用鲁棒性，在图遗忘任务中实现了优异的性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in graph unlearning models have enhanced model utility by
preserving the node representation essentially invariant, while using gradient
ascent on the forget set to achieve unlearning. However, this approach causes a
drastic degradation in model utility during the unlearning process due to the
rapid divergence speed of gradient ascent. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{INPO}, an \textbf{I}nfluence-aware \textbf{N}egative
\textbf{P}reference \textbf{O}ptimization framework that focuses on slowing the
divergence speed and improving the robustness of the model utility to the
unlearning process. Specifically, we first analyze that NPO has slower
divergence speed and theoretically propose that unlearning high-influence edges
can reduce impact of unlearning. We design an influence-aware message function
to amplify the influence of unlearned edges and mitigate the tight topological
coupling between the forget set and the retain set. The influence of each edge
is quickly estimated by a removal-based method. Additionally, we propose a
topological entropy loss from the perspective of topology to avoid excessive
information loss in the local structure during unlearning. Extensive
experiments conducted on five real-world datasets demonstrate that INPO-based
model achieves state-of-the-art performance on all forget quality metrics while
maintaining the model's utility. Codes are available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ELUTQ是一个高效的量化框架，通过引入分层线性量化(HLQ)格式，在CPU边缘设备上实现低比特量化，显著降低内存使用和延迟，同时保持推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在CPU边缘设备上部署大语言模型面临内存和计算资源有限的挑战，现有硬件友好的均匀量化方法无法很好地适应权重分布，且在低比特宽度下反量化开销较大。

Method: 提出分层线性量化(HLQ)格式，更好地捕捉权重统计特征而不增加基于查找表的GEMM操作计算成本，消除反量化开销。该框架提供优化的CPU内核进行端到端推理。

Result: 对于LLaMA3-8B，HLQ在3位精度下降低困惑度约8%，在2位精度下降低85%，量化时间在1小时内完成。通过高效微调，2位性能在2小时内进一步提升。在Apple M2芯片上，2位LLaMA2-7B实现超过25 tokens/s的推理速度。

Conclusion: ELUTQ框架通过HLQ量化格式有效解决了边缘设备上LLM部署的内存和延迟瓶颈，在保持性能的同时显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on CPU-based edge devices is
crucial for enabling on-device intelligence and expanding AI accessibility.
However, it remains challenging due to limited memory and computational
resources. During edge inference, memory usage and latency are the primary
bottlenecks. Although weight quantization can effectively reduce memory
consumption, existing hardware-friendly approaches often rely on uniform
quantization, which poorly fits weight distributions and incurs high
dequantization overhead at low bit widths. To address these limitations, we
propose ELUTQ, an efficient quantization framework introducing a novel
quantization format, Hierarchical Linear Quantization (HLQ). HLQ better
captures the statistical characteristics of weights without increasing the
computational cost of Bit-serial LUT-based GEMM operations, thereby eliminating
dequantization overhead. It is orthogonal to existing quantization algorithms
and can be seamlessly integrated into various quantization pipelines. For
efficient on-device deployment, ELUTQ provides optimized CPU kernels for
end-to-end inference. Experiments show that for LLaMA3-8B, HLQ reduces
perplexity by about 8% at 3-bit and 85% at 2-bit precision under post-training
quantization, completing quantization within one hour. With efficient
finetuning, HLQ further improves 2-bit performance within two hours. In terms
of inference efficiency, our 2-bit LLaMA2-7B achieves over 25 tokens/s on an
Apple M2 chip (4 threads, batch size = 1).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在边缘设备部署时的三个关键挑战：(1)量化后MAC操作仍不可避免且能耗高；(2)反量化引入额外计算和数据移动；(3)统一参数位宽会裁剪显著值，而通道内混合精度在当前矩阵硬件上不实用。受脉冲神经网络二进制信息表示和IF机制的启发，提出更节能的解决方案。

Method: 选择性对具有显著值的激活应用混合精度量化，并将其重新编码为二进制脉冲计数，实现不同位宽的动态混合存储。通过将量化尺度嵌入IF机制的阈值中，在权重和激活上执行节能的线性变换，避免显式反量化操作。

Result: 在W4A4量化设置下，SpikeQuant持续实现接近FP16的困惑度，同时与现有方法相比能耗降低高达4.6倍。

Conclusion: SpikeQuant证明了在保持高准确度的同时显著降低能耗的有效性，为大语言模型在边缘设备上的准确且节能部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), weight-activation quantization
helps fit models on edge device by reducing memory and compute bit-widths.
However, three challenges persist for energy constrained hardware: (1) even
after quantization, multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations remain unavoidable and
continue to dominate energy consumption; (2) dequantization (or
per-tensor/channel rescaling) introduces extra arithmetic and data movement,
increasing latency and energy; (3) uniform parameters bit widths clip salient
values-while intra-channel mixed precision is generally impractical on current
matrix hardware and memory. In contrast, brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks
(SNNs), owing to their binary spike-based information representation and the
Integrate-and-Fire (IF) paradigm, naturally support mixed-precision storage and
energy-efficient computation by replacing complex MACs with temporal Accumulate
(ACCs). Motivated by this property, we propose SpikeQuant, which selectively
applies mixed-precision quantization to activations with salient values and
re-encodes them into binary spike counts, thereby enabling dynamic mixed
storage of different bitwidths. Furthermore, by embedding the quantization
scale into the threshold of the IF mechanism, our approach performs
energy-efficient linear transformations on weights and activations while
avoiding explicit dequantization. Experimental results demonstrate that
SpikeQuant consistently achieves near-FP16 perplexity under W4A4 quantization
while reducing energy cost by up to 4.6 times compared to existing methods,
highlighting its effectiveness for accurate and energy-efficient LLM
deployment.

Conclusion: 多模型联盟一致性方法能有效提升LLM幻觉处理能力，且具有成本效益，为实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated state-of-the-art results in large language model
(LLM) hallucination detection and mitigation through consistency-based
approaches which involve aggregating multiple responses sampled from a single
LLM for a given prompt. These approaches help offset limitations stemming from
the imperfect data on which LLMs are trained, which includes biases and
under-representation of information required at deployment time among other
limitations which can lead to hallucinations. We show that extending these
single-model consistency methods to combine responses from multiple LLMs with
different training data, training schemes and model architectures can result in
substantial further improvements in hallucination detection and mitigation
capabilities beyond their single-model consistency counterparts. We evaluate
this \emph{consortium consistency} approach across many model teams from a pool
of 15 LLMs and explore under what conditions it is beneficial to team together
different LLMs in this manner. Further, we show that these performance
improvements often come with reduced inference costs, offsetting a significant
drawback with single-model consistency methods.

Conclusion: Bi-DFCL通过决策导向的因果学习方法有效解决了营销优化中的核心挑战，实现了最优的偏差-方差权衡

Abstract: Online Internet platforms require sophisticated marketing strategies to
optimize user retention and platform revenue -- a classical resource allocation
problem. Traditional solutions adopt a two-stage pipeline: machine learning
(ML) for predicting individual treatment effects to marketing actions, followed
by operations research (OR) optimization for decision-making. This paradigm
presents two fundamental technical challenges. First, the prediction-decision
misalignment: Conventional ML methods focus solely on prediction accuracy
without considering downstream optimization objectives, leading to improved
predictive metrics that fail to translate to better decisions. Second, the
bias-variance dilemma: Observational data suffers from multiple biases (e.g.,
selection bias, position bias), while experimental data (e.g., randomized
controlled trials), though unbiased, is typically scarce and costly --
resulting in high-variance estimates. We propose Bi-level Decision-Focused
Causal Learning (Bi-DFCL) that systematically addresses these challenges.
First, we develop an unbiased estimator of OR decision quality using
experimental data, which guides ML model training through surrogate loss
functions that bridge discrete optimization gradients. Second, we establish a
bi-level optimization framework that jointly leverages observational and
experimental data, solved via implicit differentiation. This novel formulation
enables our unbiased OR estimator to correct learning directions from biased
observational data, achieving optimal bias-variance tradeoff. Extensive
evaluations on public benchmarks, industrial marketing datasets, and
large-scale online A/B tests demonstrate the effectiveness of Bi-DFCL, showing
statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art. Currently,
Bi-DFCL has been deployed at Meituan, one of the largest online food delivery
platforms in the world.

Conclusion: REBMBO通过动态调整探索深度和方向，有效克服了传统贝叶斯优化方法的局限性，在复杂优化任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Existing Bayesian Optimization (BO) methods typically balance exploration and
exploitation to optimize costly objective functions. However, these methods
often suffer from a significant one-step bias, which may lead to convergence
towards local optima and poor performance in complex or high-dimensional tasks.
Recently, Black-Box Optimization (BBO) has achieved success across various
scientific and engineering domains, particularly when function evaluations are
costly and gradients are unavailable. Motivated by this, we propose the
Reinforced Energy-Based Model for Bayesian Optimization (REBMBO), which
integrates Gaussian Processes (GP) for local guidance with an Energy-Based
Model (EBM) to capture global structural information. Notably, we define each
Bayesian Optimization iteration as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and use
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for adaptive multi-step lookahead,
dynamically adjusting the depth and direction of exploration to effectively
overcome the limitations of traditional BO methods. We conduct extensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, confirming the superior
performance of REBMBO. Additional analyses across various GP configurations
further highlight its adaptability and robustness.

Abstract: We revisit the problem of controlling linear systems with quadratic cost
under unknown dynamics with model-based reinforcement learning. Traditional
methods like Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty and Thompson Sampling, rooted
in multi-armed bandits (MABs), face practical limitations. In contrast, we
propose an alternative based on the Confusing Instance (CI) principle, which
underpins regret lower bounds in MABs and discrete Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs) and is central to the Minimum Empirical Divergence (MED) family of
algorithms, known for their asymptotic optimality in various settings. By
leveraging the structure of LQR policies along with sensitivity and stability
analysis, we develop MED-LQ. This novel control strategy extends the principles
of CI and MED beyond small-scale settings. Our benchmarks on a comprehensive
control suite demonstrate that MED-LQ achieves competitive performance in
various scenarios while highlighting its potential for broader applications in
large-scale MDPs.

Abstract: AI methods are increasingly shaping pharmaceutical drug discovery. However,
their translation to industrial applications remains limited due to their
reliance on public datasets, lacking scale and diversity of proprietary
pharmaceutical data. Federated learning (FL) offers a promising approach to
integrate private data into privacy-preserving, collaborative model training
across data silos. This federated data access complicates important
data-centric tasks such as estimating dataset diversity, performing informed
data splits, and understanding the structure of the combined chemical space. To
address this gap, we investigate how well federated clustering methods can
disentangle and represent distributed molecular data. We benchmark three
approaches, Federated kMeans (Fed-kMeans), Federated Principal Component
Analysis combined with Fed-kMeans (Fed-PCA+Fed-kMeans), and Federated
Locality-Sensitive Hashing (Fed-LSH), against their centralized counterparts on
eight diverse molecular datasets. Our evaluation utilizes both, standard
mathematical and a chemistry-informed evaluation metrics, SF-ICF, that we
introduce in this work. The large-scale benchmarking combined with an in-depth
explainability analysis shows the importance of incorporating domain knowledge
through chemistry-informed metrics, and on-client explainability analyses for
federated diversity analysis on molecular data.

*Jinpyo Hong,Rachel E. Baker*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了ForecastNet-XCL混合深度学习框架，用于基于气候和时间数据预测RSV疫情，无需实时监测数据，可提前100周进行多周预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习在传染病爆发预测中应用广泛，但针对地方性疾病的预测研究不足，特别是RSV疫情预测。

Method: 基于XGBoost+CNN+BiLSTM的集成模型，结合高分辨率特征学习和长期时间依赖捕捉机制，通过自回归模块训练气候控制的滞后关系，使用随机推理返回概率区间。

Result: 在美国34个州的评估中，ForecastNet-XCL在州内和跨州场景下均可靠地优于统计基线、单个神经网络和传统集成方法，在长期预测中保持准确性。

Conclusion: ForecastNet-XCL的效率、性能和不确定性感知设计使其成为在气候压力加剧和监测资源受限情况下的可部署早期预警工具。

Abstract: Precise outbreak forecasting of infectious diseases is essential for
effective public health responses and epidemic control. The increased
availability of machine learning (ML) methods for time-series forecasting
presents an enticing avenue to enhance outbreak forecasting. Though the
COVID-19 outbreak demonstrated the value of applying ML models to predict
epidemic profiles, using ML models to forecast endemic diseases remains
underexplored. In this work, we present ForecastNet-XCL (an ensemble model
based on XGBoost+CNN+BiLSTM), a deep learning hybrid framework designed to
addresses this gap by creating accurate multi-week RSV forecasts up to 100
weeks in advance based on climate and temporal data, without access to
real-time surveillance on RSV. The framework combines high-resolution feature
learning with long-range temporal dependency capturing mechanisms, bolstered by
an autoregressive module trained on climate-controlled lagged relations.
Stochastic inference returns probabilistic intervals to inform decision-making.
Evaluated across 34 U.S. states, ForecastNet-XCL reliably outperformed
statistical baselines, individual neural nets, and conventional ensemble
methods in both within- and cross-state scenarios, sustaining accuracy over
extended forecast horizons. Training on climatologically diverse datasets
enhanced generalization furthermore, particularly in locations having irregular
or biennial RSV patterns. ForecastNet-XCL's efficiency, performance, and
uncertainty-aware design make it a deployable early-warning tool amid
escalating climate pressures and constrained surveillance resources.

*Jin Han,Zhe Zheng,Yi Gu,Jia-Rui Lin,Xin-Zheng Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiffEvac是一种基于生成模型的新方法，通过学习建筑疏散模式实现高效疏散模拟，相比传统方法显著提升速度和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统疏散模拟依赖精细化建模和大量参数，难以在早期设计阶段进行快速迭代。需要一种更高效的方法来支持快速设计迭代。

Method: 建立包含399种不同功能布局和对应疏散热力图的数据集，提出解耦特征表示方法嵌入物理特征，基于图像提示的扩散模型学习疏散模式。

Result: 相比现有条件GAN方法，DiffEvac在SSIM指标上提升37.6%，PSNR提升142%，速度快16倍，模拟时间缩短至2分钟。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升快速设计迭代效率，为智能建筑安全优化提供新思路，降低建模负担，支持大规模假设探索，并能与多目标设计工具耦合。

Abstract: Evacuation simulation is essential for building safety design, ensuring
properly planned evacuation routes. However, traditional evacuation simulation
relies heavily on refined modeling with extensive parameters, making it
challenging to adopt such methods in a rapid iteration process in early design
stages. Thus, this study proposes DiffEvac, a novel method to learn building
evacuation patterns based on Generative Models (GMs), for efficient evacuation
simulation and enhanced safety design. Initially, a dataset of 399 diverse
functional layouts and corresponding evacuation heatmaps of buildings was
established. Then, a decoupled feature representation is proposed to embed
physical features like layouts and occupant density for GMs. Finally, a
diffusion model based on image prompts is proposed to learn evacuation patterns
from simulated evacuation heatmaps. Compared to existing research using
Conditional GANs with RGB representation, DiffEvac achieves up to a 37.6%
improvement in SSIM, 142% in PSNR, and delivers results 16 times faster,
thereby cutting simulation time to 2 minutes. Case studies further demonstrate
that the proposed method not only significantly enhances the rapid design
iteration and adjustment process with efficient evacuation simulation but also
offers new insights and technical pathways for future safety optimization in
intelligent building design. The research implication is that the approach
lowers the modeling burden, enables large-scale what-if exploration, and
facilitates coupling with multi-objective design tools.

Result: 实现了三个实证应用：5000万参数模型的权重稀疏化、生成模型的保守性约束施加、以及基于预测性能的高斯过程超参数调优。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了开发可微线性代数工具并将其广泛应用于机器学习实践的下一个迭代。

Abstract: This paper argues that the method of least squares has significant
unfulfilled potential in modern machine learning, far beyond merely being a
tool for fitting linear models. To release its potential, we derive custom
gradients that transform the solver into a differentiable operator, like a
neural network layer, enabling many diverse applications. Empirically, we
demonstrate: (i) scalability by enforcing weight sparsity on a 50 million
parameter model; (ii) imposing conservativeness constraints in score-based
generative models; and (iii) hyperparameter tuning of Gaussian processes based
on predictive performance. By doing this, our work represents the next
iteration in developing differentiable linear-algebra tools and making them
widely accessible to machine learning practitioners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LoRA变体缺乏明确区分任务相关信息在低秩子空间中的机制，可能限制下游性能。

Method: 使用变分自编码器学习两个不同的潜在空间，通过新的证据下界公式化促进潜在空间之间的因子分解，一个空间专门处理任务显著特征，另一个处理残差信息。

Result: 在文本、音频和图像任务上的广泛实验表明，FVAE-LoRA始终优于标准LoRA。伪相关评估证实FVAE-LoRA能更好地隔离任务相关信号，在分布偏移下具有更好的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FVAE-LoRA通过显式因子分解机制有效提升了LoRA的性能和鲁棒性，在各种任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used method for parameter-efficient
finetuning. However, existing LoRA variants lack mechanisms to explicitly
disambiguate task-relevant information within the learned low-rank subspace,
potentially limiting downstream performance. We propose Factorized Variational
Autoencoder LoRA (FVAE-LoRA), which leverages a VAE to learn two distinct
latent spaces. Our novel Evidence Lower Bound formulation explicitly promotes
factorization between the latent spaces, dedicating one latent space to
task-salient features and the other to residual information. Extensive
experiments on text, audio, and image tasks demonstrate that FVAE-LoRA
consistently outperforms standard LoRA. Moreover, spurious correlation
evaluations confirm that FVAE-LoRA better isolates task-relevant signals,
leading to improved robustness under distribution shifts. Our code is publicly

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的重叠加权正交元学习器，用于估计时变环境中的异质处理效应，通过数据驱动方法解决处理序列重叠不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时变环境中观察特定处理序列的概率随预测时间增长呈指数下降，导致数据支持不足和严重重叠问题，现有方法在处理重叠低时估计方差爆炸。

Method: 开发了Neyman正交总体风险函数，最小化重叠加权的oracle风险，构建具有Neyman正交性的重叠加权正交元学习器，对干扰函数误设具有鲁棒性。

Result: WO学习器能够抵消现有元学习器的不稳定性，获得更可靠的异质处理效应估计，通过Transformer和LSTM骨干网络的广泛实验验证了其优势。

Conclusion: 提出的重叠加权正交元学习器为时变环境中异质处理效应估计提供了完全数据驱动的方法，具有模型无关性和对干扰函数误设的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) in time-varying settings is
particularly challenging, as the probability of observing certain treatment
sequences decreases exponentially with longer prediction horizons. Thus, the
observed data contain little support for many plausible treatment sequences,
which creates severe overlap problems. Existing meta-learners for the
time-varying setting typically assume adequate treatment overlap, and thus
suffer from exploding estimation variance when the overlap is low. To address
this problem, we introduce a novel overlap-weighted orthogonal (WO)
meta-learner for estimating HTEs that targets regions in the observed data with
high probability of receiving the interventional treatment sequences. This
offers a fully data-driven approach through which our WO-learner can counteract
instabilities as in existing meta-learners and thus obtain more reliable HTE
estimates. Methodologically, we develop a novel Neyman-orthogonal population
risk function that minimizes the overlap-weighted oracle risk. We show that our
WO-learner has the favorable property of Neyman-orthogonality, meaning that it
is robust against misspecification in the nuisance functions. Further, our
WO-learner is fully model-agnostic and can be applied to any machine learning
model. Through extensive experiments with both transformer and LSTM backbones,
we demonstrate the benefits of our novel WO-learner.

TL;DR: 该论文研究带弃权的策略学习，允许策略在不确定时选择弃权，获得比随机猜测稍高的奖励。提出了两阶段学习器，先识别近似最优策略集，然后基于它们的分歧构建弃权规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统策略学习算法在预测不确定时仍强制决策，这在高风险场景中存在风险。需要一种能够识别不确定性并选择弃权的机制。

Method: 提出两阶段学习器：第一阶段识别近似最优策略集合，第二阶段基于这些策略之间的分歧构建弃权规则。使用双重稳健目标处理未知倾向得分的情况。

Result: 当倾向得分已知时，获得O(1/n)类型的快速遗憾保证；扩展到未知倾向得分情况。弃权机制还支持边界条件下的改进保证、分布稳健策略学习和安全策略改进。

Conclusion: 弃权是策略学习中的多功能工具，能够在不确定时提供安全机制，同时支持多种核心问题的改进，包括边界条件、分布稳健性和安全策略改进。

Abstract: Policy learning algorithms are widely used in areas such as personalized
medicine and advertising to develop individualized treatment regimes. However,
most methods force a decision even when predictions are uncertain, which is
risky in high-stakes settings. We study policy learning with abstention, where
a policy may defer to a safe default or an expert. When a policy abstains, it
receives a small additive reward on top of the value of a random guess. We
propose a two-stage learner that first identifies a set of near-optimal
policies and then constructs an abstention rule from their disagreements. We
establish fast O(1/n)-type regret guarantees when propensities are known, and
extend these guarantees to the unknown-propensity case via a doubly robust (DR)
objective. We further show that abstention is a versatile tool with direct
applications to other core problems in policy learning: it yields improved
guarantees under margin conditions without the common realizability assumption,
connects to distributionally robust policy learning by hedging against small
data shifts, and supports safe policy improvement by ensuring improvement over
a baseline policy with high probability.

Motivation: 随着深度神经网络模型规模增大，而部署环境资源受限，内存高效的训练变得越来越重要。

Method: 提出动态通道选择方法，在预选层中随机重采样通道，利用架构相关的层重要性先验知识。

Result: 在各种下游任务和架构上实现最先进性能，达到99%激活稀疏度、95%权重导数稀疏度，权重导数计算FLOPs减少97%。

Conclusion: TraDy在保持严格内存约束的同时，通过动态随机通道选择实现了高效的迁移学习。

Abstract: Memory-efficient training of deep neural networks has become increasingly
important as models grow larger while deployment environments impose strict
resource constraints. We propose TraDy, a novel transfer learning scheme
leveraging two key insights: layer importance for updates is
architecture-dependent and determinable a priori, while dynamic stochastic
channel selection provides superior gradient approximation compared to static
approaches. We introduce a dynamic channel selection approach that
stochastically resamples channels between epochs within preselected layers.
Extensive experiments demonstrate TraDy achieves state-of-the-art performance
across various downstream tasks and architectures while maintaining strict
memory constraints, achieving up to 99% activation sparsity, 95% weight
derivative sparsity, and 97% reduction in FLOPs for weight derivative
computation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出分层推测解码（HSD）算法，通过将多个草稿模型堆叠成层次结构来减少Transformer语言模型的推理延迟，相比最佳单草稿基线可获得最高1.2倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推测解码使用单一草稿模型，但实践中存在多种潜在草稿模型，在速度和准确性之间存在权衡。为了进一步降低生成延迟，需要利用多个草稿模型的层次结构。

Method: HSD将草稿模型堆叠成层次结构，每个模型提出token，下一个更大的模型在单次前向传播中验证这些token，最终由目标模型验证token。

Result: 推导了任意此类层次结构的期望延迟表达式，证明选择延迟最优层次结构可在多项式时间内完成。实验显示HSD相比最佳单草稿基线可获得最高1.2倍加速。

Conclusion: HSD算法通过利用多个草稿模型的层次结构，有效减少了生成延迟，超越了先前技术，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Transformer language models generate text autoregressively, making inference
latency proportional to the number of tokens generated. Speculative decoding
reduces this latency without sacrificing output quality, by leveraging a small
draft model to propose tokens that the larger target model verifies in
parallel. In practice, however, there may exist a set of potential draft
models- ranging from faster but less inaccurate, to slower yet more reliable.
We introduce Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD), an algorithm that stacks
these draft models into a hierarchy, where each model proposes tokens, and the
next larger model verifies them in a single forward pass, until finally the
target model verifies tokens. We derive an expression for the expected latency
of any such hierarchy and show that selecting the latency-optimal hierarchy can
be done in polynomial time. Empirically, HSD gives up to 1.2x speed-up over the
best single-draft baseline, demonstrating the practicality of our algorithm in
reducing generation latency beyond previous techniques.

TL;DR: SEMPO是一个轻量级时间序列基础模型，通过能量感知频谱分解和混合提示Transformer，在减少预训练数据规模和模型大小的同时，实现了强大的零样本和少样本预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型需要大规模预训练数据和庞大网络架构，在资源受限环境中部署困难。为解决通用性与可负担性之间的矛盾，需要开发轻量级但性能强大的模型。

Method: 1) 能量感知频谱分解模块：同时建模高能量和低能量频率信号，提高预训练数据利用率；2) 混合提示Transformer：通过数据集特定提示学习异构时序模式，自适应路由时间序列token到基于提示的专家进行参数高效适配。

Result: 在两个大规模基准测试（涵盖16个数据集）上，SEMPO在零样本和少样本预测场景中均优于最先进方法，显著减少了预训练数据规模和模型大小。

Conclusion: SEMPO通过创新的频谱分解和提示机制，成功解决了时间序列基础模型在资源受限环境中的部署问题，在保持强大泛化能力的同时大幅降低了计算和存储需求。

Abstract: The recent boom of large pre-trained models witnesses remarkable success in
developing foundation models (FMs) for time series forecasting. Despite
impressive performance across diverse downstream forecasting tasks, existing
time series FMs possess massive network architectures and require substantial
pre-training on large-scale datasets, which significantly hinders their
deployment in resource-constrained environments. In response to this growing
tension between versatility and affordability, we propose SEMPO, a novel
lightweight foundation model that requires pretraining on relatively
small-scale data, yet exhibits strong general time series forecasting.
Concretely, SEMPO comprises two key modules: 1) energy-aware SpEctral
decomposition module, that substantially improves the utilization of
pre-training data by modeling not only the high-energy frequency signals but
also the low-energy yet informative frequency signals that are ignored in
current methods; and 2) Mixture-of-PrOmpts enabled Transformer, that learns
heterogeneous temporal patterns through small dataset-specific prompts and
adaptively routes time series tokens to prompt-based experts for
parameter-efficient model adaptation across different datasets and domains.
Equipped with these modules, SEMPO significantly reduces both pre-training data
scale and model size, while achieving strong generalization. Extensive
experiments on two large-scale benchmarks covering 16 datasets demonstrate the
superior performance of SEMPO in both zero-shot and few-shot forecasting
scenarios compared with state-of-the-art methods. Code and data are available
at https://github.com/mala-lab/SEMPO.

TL;DR: 提出Enhanced TimeAutoDiff框架，通过合成ICU时间序列数据来训练和评估预测模型，显著减少真实-合成数据评估差距，在细粒度人口亚组中提供更可靠的模型性能评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医疗AI中由于隐私限制导致真实数据不足的问题，特别是对于细粒度人口亚组的模型评估，需要一种隐私保护且可信的评估方法。

Method: 在现有扩散和VAE生成器基础上，引入Enhanced TimeAutoDiff，通过分布对齐惩罚增强潜在扩散目标，在MIMIC-III和eICU数据集上进行24小时死亡率和住院时间预测任务评估。

Result: Enhanced TimeAutoDiff将真实-合成数据评估差距减少70%以上，AUROC差距≤0.014，同时保持训练效用。在32个交叉亚组中，大型合成队列将亚组级AUROC估计误差减少达50%，在72-84%的亚组中优于小型真实测试集。

Conclusion: 该工作为重症监护提供了实用、隐私保护的路线图，支持跨多样化患者群体的可信、细粒度模型评估，无需暴露敏感EHR数据，有助于提升医疗AI的整体可信度。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for leveraging synthetic ICU time-series data
not only to train but also to rigorously and trustworthily evaluate predictive
models, both at the population level and within fine-grained demographic
subgroups. Building on prior diffusion and VAE-based generators (TimeDiff,
HealthGen, TimeAutoDiff), we introduce \textit{Enhanced TimeAutoDiff}, which
augments the latent diffusion objective with distribution-alignment penalties.
We extensively benchmark all models on MIMIC-III and eICU, on 24-hour mortality
and binary length-of-stay tasks. Our results show that Enhanced TimeAutoDiff
reduces the gap between real-on-synthetic and real-on-real evaluation (``TRTS
gap'') by over 70\%, achieving $\Delta_{TRTS} \leq 0.014$ AUROC, while
preserving training utility ($\Delta_{TSTR} \approx 0.01$). Crucially, for 32
intersectional subgroups, large synthetic cohorts cut subgroup-level AUROC
estimation error by up to 50\% relative to small real test sets, and outperform
them in 72--84\% of subgroups. This work provides a practical,
privacy-preserving roadmap for trustworthy, granular model evaluation in
critical care, enabling robust and reliable performance analysis across diverse
patient populations without exposing sensitive EHR data, contributing to the
overall trustworthiness of Medical AI.

Motivation: 在高风险应用中部署SGD需要严格量化其固有不确定性，现有方法计算成本高且维度缩放受限。

Method: 使用在线最小二乘SGD方法，开发在线方差估计器，并建立高概率偏差界限。

Result: SGD迭代在t ≳ d^{1+δ}时满足CLT，运行时间为O(td)，内存需求为O(d)，优于现有方法的O(td² + d³)运行时间。

Conclusion: 提出了第一个完全在线和数据驱动的框架，在接近最优缩放机制t ≳ d^{1+δ}下为SGD迭代构建置信区间。

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has become a cornerstone method in modern
data science. However, deploying SGD in high-stakes applications necessitates
rigorous quantification of its inherent uncertainty. In this work, we establish
\emph{non-asymptotic Berry--Esseen bounds} for linear functionals of online
least-squares SGD, thereby providing a Gaussian Central Limit Theorem (CLT) in
a \emph{growing-dimensional regime}. Existing approaches to high-dimensional
inference for projection parameters, such as~\cite{chang2023inference}, rely on
inverting empirical covariance matrices and require at least $t \gtrsim
d^{3/2}$ iterations to achieve finite-sample Berry--Esseen guarantees,
rendering them computationally expensive and restrictive in the allowable
dimensional scaling. In contrast, we show that a CLT holds for SGD iterates
when the number of iterations grows as $t \gtrsim d^{1+\delta}$ for any $\delta
> 0$, significantly extending the dimensional regime permitted by prior works
while improving computational efficiency. The proposed online SGD-based
procedure operates in $\mathcal{O}(td)$ time and requires only $\mathcal{O}(d)$
memory, in contrast to the $\mathcal{O}(td^2 + d^3)$ runtime of
covariance-inversion methods. To render the theory practically applicable, we
further develop an \emph{online variance estimator} for the asymptotic variance
appearing in the CLT and establish \emph{high-probability deviation bounds} for
this estimator. Collectively, these results yield the first fully online and
data-driven framework for constructing confidence intervals for SGD iterates in
the near-optimal scaling regime $t \gtrsim d^{1+\delta}$.

Abstract: Diffusion Models have become a cornerstone of modern generative AI for their
exceptional generation quality and controllability. However, their inherent
\textit{multi-step iterations} and \textit{complex backbone networks} lead to
prohibitive computational overhead and generation latency, forming a major
bottleneck for real-time applications. Although existing acceleration
techniques have made progress, they still face challenges such as limited
applicability, high training costs, or quality degradation.
  Against this backdrop, \textbf{Diffusion Caching} offers a promising
training-free, architecture-agnostic, and efficient inference paradigm. Its
core mechanism identifies and reuses intrinsic computational redundancies in
the diffusion process. By enabling feature-level cross-step reuse and
inter-layer scheduling, it reduces computation without modifying model
parameters. This paper systematically reviews the theoretical foundations and
evolution of Diffusion Caching and proposes a unified framework for its
classification and analysis.
  Through comparative analysis of representative methods, we show that
Diffusion Caching evolves from \textit{static reuse} to \textit{dynamic
prediction}. This trend enhances caching flexibility across diverse tasks and
enables integration with other acceleration techniques such as sampling
optimization and model distillation, paving the way for a unified, efficient
inference framework for future multimodal and interactive applications. We
argue that this paradigm will become a key enabler of real-time and efficient
generative AI, injecting new vitality into both theory and practice of
\textit{Efficient Generative Intelligence}.

Abstract: Species distribution models (SDMs), which aim to predict species occurrence
based on environmental variables, are widely used to monitor and respond to
biodiversity change. Recent deep learning advances for SDMs have been shown to
perform well on complex and heterogeneous datasets, but their effectiveness
remains limited by spatial biases in the data. In this paper, we revisit deep
SDMs from a Bayesian perspective and introduce BATIS, a novel and practical
framework wherein prior predictions are updated iteratively using limited
observational data. Models must appropriately capture both aleatoric and
epistemic uncertainty to effectively combine fine-grained local insights with
broader ecological patterns. We benchmark an extensive set of uncertainty
quantification approaches on a novel dataset including citizen science
observations from the eBird platform. Our empirical study shows how Bayesian
deep learning approaches can greatly improve the reliability of SDMs in
data-scarce locations, which can contribute to ecological understanding and
conservation efforts.

Motivation: Transformer模型经常无法学习可泛化的算法，而是依赖脆弱的启发式策略。本文旨在从理论和实验角度解释这一现象，以图连通性作为测试平台。

Method: 使用简化的解耦Transformer架构，理论证明L层模型只能解决直径不超过3^L的图，相当于计算邻接矩阵的幂。分析训练动态，研究训练实例是否在模型容量范围内对学习策略的影响。

Result: 理论证明L层Transformer最多能处理直径为3^L的图。实验表明：在容量范围内的图驱动学习正确算法，超出容量的图导致学习基于节点度的简单启发式策略。限制训练数据在模型容量内可使标准和解耦Transformer都学习精确算法。

Conclusion: Transformer学习算法失败的原因在于训练数据超出模型的理论容量，导致模型退化为学习简单的启发式策略。通过适当限制训练数据范围，可以促使Transformer学习正确的算法解决方案。

Abstract: Transformers often fail to learn generalizable algorithms, instead relying on
brittle heuristics. Using graph connectivity as a testbed, we explain this
phenomenon both theoretically and empirically. We consider a simplified
Transformer architecture, the disentangled Transformer, and prove that an
$L$-layer model has capacity to solve for graphs with diameters up to exactly
$3^L$, implementing an algorithm equivalent to computing powers of the
adjacency matrix. We analyze the training-dynamics, and show that the learned
strategy hinges on whether most training instances are within this model
capacity. Within-capacity graphs (diameter $\leq 3^L$) drive the learning of a
correct algorithmic solution while beyond-capacity graphs drive the learning of
a simple heuristic based on node degrees. Finally, we empirically demonstrate
that restricting training data within a model's capacity leads to both standard
and disentangled transformers learning the exact algorithm rather than the
degree-based heuristic.

TL;DR: CONFEX提出了一种结合共形预测和混合整数线性规划的方法，生成具有不确定性感知的反事实解释，提供局部覆盖保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反事实解释方法往往忽视预测不确定性，缺乏将不确定性纳入解释的机制和形式化保证，导致解释可能不可靠。

Method: 使用共形预测和混合整数线性规划，通过离线树基输入空间分区实现高效的MILP编码，生成具有局部覆盖保证的不确定性感知反事实解释。

Result: 在多个基准测试和指标评估中，CONFEX相比现有方法能产生更鲁棒和合理的解释。

Conclusion: CONFEX方法能够生成具有严格不确定性保证和最优性的反事实解释，提高了反事实解释的可靠性和实用性。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFXs) provide human-understandable
justifications for model predictions, enabling actionable recourse and
enhancing interpretability. To be reliable, CFXs must avoid regions of high
predictive uncertainty, where explanations may be misleading or inapplicable.
However, existing methods often neglect uncertainty or lack principled
mechanisms for incorporating it with formal guarantees. We propose CONFEX, a
novel method for generating uncertainty-aware counterfactual explanations using
Conformal Prediction (CP) and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP). CONFEX
explanations are designed to provide local coverage guarantees, addressing the
issue that CFX generation violates exchangeability. To do so, we develop a
novel localised CP procedure that enjoys an efficient MILP encoding by
leveraging an offline tree-based partitioning of the input space. This way,
CONFEX generates CFXs with rigorous guarantees on both predictive uncertainty
and optimality. We evaluate CONFEX against state-of-the-art methods across
diverse benchmarks and metrics, demonstrating that our uncertainty-aware
approach yields robust and plausible explanations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需参考模型即可评估模型对成员推理攻击脆弱性的新方法，通过分析损失分布的不对称性和重尾特性来估计模型级漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的最先进成员推理攻击需要训练大量计算昂贵的参考模型，限制了其实用性，因此需要开发更高效的方法来评估模型隐私风险。

Method: 利用训练和测试分布中高损失区域异常值的缺失作为风险预测指标，通过简单的损失攻击的TNR来估计模型级脆弱性。

Result: 该方法在多种架构和数据集上都能准确估计模型对最先进MIA攻击(LiRA)的脆弱性，且优于低成本的RMIA攻击和其他分布差异度量方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为评估模型隐私风险提供了一种高效实用的替代方案，特别是在大型语言模型风险评估方面具有应用前景。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) have emerged as the standard tool for
evaluating the privacy risks of AI models. However, state-of-the-art attacks
require training numerous, often computationally expensive, reference models,
limiting their practicality. We present a novel approach for estimating
model-level vulnerability, the TPR at low FPR, to membership inference attacks
without requiring reference models. Empirical analysis shows loss distributions
to be asymmetric and heavy-tailed and suggests that most points at risk from
MIAs have moved from the tail (high-loss region) to the head (low-loss region)
of the distribution after training. We leverage this insight to propose a
method to estimate model-level vulnerability from the training and testing
distribution alone: using the absence of outliers from the high-loss region as
a predictor of the risk. We evaluate our method, the TNR of a simple loss
attack, across a wide range of architectures and datasets and show it to
accurately estimate model-level vulnerability to the SOTA MIA attack (LiRA). We
also show our method to outperform both low-cost (few reference models) attacks
such as RMIA and other measures of distribution difference. We finally evaluate
the use of non-linear functions to evaluate risk and show the approach to be
promising to evaluate the risk in large-language models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GaLLoP是一种基于梯度的稀疏微调技术，通过选择梯度幅度大但预训练幅度小的参数进行微调，在保持预训练知识的同时提高任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏微调技术的效果依赖于最优选择要微调的模型参数。现有方法在参数选择上存在优化空间。

Method: GaLLoP选择在下游任务中梯度幅度最大且预训练幅度最小的参数进行微调，优先考虑任务相关性强但对预训练知识破坏小的参数。

Result: 在LLaMA3 8B和Gemma 2B上的实验表明，GaLLoP在分布内和分布外性能上优于或匹配LoRA、DoRA和SAFT等领先的参数高效微调技术。

Conclusion: GaLLoP能够缓解灾难性遗忘和任务数据记忆问题，稳定性能表现，并在大多数随机种子下实现稳健的泛化。

Abstract: Sparse fine-tuning techniques adapt LLMs to downstream tasks by only tuning a
sparse subset of model parameters. However, the effectiveness of sparse
adaptation depends on optimally selecting the model parameters to be
fine-tuned. In this work, we introduce a novel sparse fine-tuning technique
named GaLLoP: Gradient-based Sparse Learning on Low-Magnitude Parameters, which
fine-tunes only those model parameters which have the largest gradient
magnitudes on downstream tasks and the smallest pre-trained magnitudes,
intuitively prioritizing parameters that are highly task-relevant, but
minimally disruptive to pre-trained knowledge. Our experimentation with LLaMA3
8B and Gemma 2B as base models shows that GaLLoP consistently improves or
matches the in-distribution as well as out-of-distribution performance obtained
via the usage of other leading parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques,
including LoRA, DoRA, and SAFT. Our analysis demonstrates that GaLLoP mitigates
catastrophic forgetting and memorization of task data, as important pre-trained
parameters remain unchanged, and stabilizes performance relative to other
fine-tuning techniques, robustly generalizing across most random seeds.

TL;DR: DynaInfer是一种新方法，通过分析固定神经网络在每轮训练中的预测误差来推断环境规范，直接从数据中实现环境分配，解决了环境标签缺失的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据驱动方法依赖IID数据假设，但环境差异处理技术需要环境标签，而这些标签在训练时往往由于数据采集困难、隐私问题和环境变异性而不可得。

Method: 提出DynaInfer方法，通过分析固定神经网络在每轮训练中的预测误差来推断环境规范，实现直接从数据中进行环境分配。

Result: 实验表明DynaInfer优于现有环境分配技术，能快速收敛到真实标签，即使在环境标签可用时也能实现更优性能。

Conclusion: DynaInfer有效解决了无标签场景下的交替优化问题，为处理复杂动态系统中的环境差异提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Data-driven methods offer efficient and robust solutions for analyzing
complex dynamical systems but rely on the assumption of I.I.D. data, driving
the development of generalization techniques for handling environmental
differences. These techniques, however, are limited by their dependence on
environment labels, which are often unavailable during training due to data
acquisition challenges, privacy concerns, and environmental variability,
particularly in large public datasets and privacy-sensitive domains. In
response, we propose DynaInfer, a novel method that infers environment
specifications by analyzing prediction errors from fixed neural networks within
each training round, enabling environment assignments directly from data. We
prove our algorithm effectively solves the alternating optimization problem in
unlabeled scenarios and validate it through extensive experiments across
diverse dynamical systems. Results show that DynaInfer outperforms existing
environment assignment techniques, converges rapidly to true labels, and even
achieves superior performance when environment labels are available.

Motivation: 解决如何证明一个黑盒衍生模型是否使用了原始开源模型的问题，为模型版权保护提供统计证据。

Method: 将问题建模为独立性测试，利用语言模型对后期训练数据记忆更强的特性，通过相关性分析检测训练数据顺序与衍生模型输出的关联。

Result: 在查询设置下，对40多个Pythia和OLMo微调模型进行测试，p值大多低于1e-8；在观测设置下，基于文本重叠和模型重训练的方法都能有效检测模型使用。

Conclusion: 该方法能够可靠地检测模型衍生使用，为开源模型版权保护提供了有效的统计验证手段。

Abstract: Suppose Alice trains an open-weight language model and Bob uses a blackbox
derivative of Alice's model to produce text. Can Alice prove that Bob is using
her model, either by querying Bob's derivative model (query setting) or from
the text alone (observational setting)? We formulate this question as an
independence testing problem--in which the null hypothesis is that Bob's model
or text is independent of Alice's randomized training run--and investigate it
through the lens of palimpsestic memorization in language models: models are
more likely to memorize data seen later in training, so we can test whether Bob
is using Alice's model using test statistics that capture correlation between
Bob's model or text and the ordering of training examples in Alice's training
run. If Alice has randomly shuffled her training data, then any significant
correlation amounts to exactly quantifiable statistical evidence against the
null hypothesis, regardless of the composition of Alice's training data. In the
query setting, we directly estimate (via prompting) the likelihood Bob's model
gives to Alice's training examples and order; we correlate the likelihoods of
over 40 fine-tunes of various Pythia and OLMo base models ranging from 1B to
12B parameters with the base model's training data order, achieving a p-value
on the order of at most 1e-8 in all but six cases. In the observational
setting, we try two approaches based on estimating 1) the likelihood of Bob's
text overlapping with spans of Alice's training examples and 2) the likelihood
of Bob's text with respect to different versions of Alice's model we obtain by
repeating the last phase (e.g., 1%) of her training run on reshuffled data. The
second approach can reliably distinguish Bob's text from as little as a few
hundred tokens; the first does not involve any retraining but requires many
more tokens (several hundred thousand) to achieve high power.

*Roey Magen,Gal Vardi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次从理论上证明，通过梯度下降训练的简化transformer架构可以在线性分类设置中作为接近最优的元学习器，仅需少量上下文示例就能适应新任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然transformer展示了强大的上下文学习能力，但现有理论分析大多未涉及正式的元学习设置。本文旨在从理论上验证transformer能否作为元学习器，在相关任务集合上比单独解决每个任务更高效地学习。

Method: 使用简化的transformer架构，通过梯度下降训练，在线性分类设置中分析其元学习能力。考虑一类任务，每个任务对应类条件高斯混合模型，均值向量位于共享的k维子空间中。

Result: 训练足够多任务后，transformer仅需O(k/R^4)个上下文示例就能泛化到新任务，这几乎匹配了知道共享子空间的最优学习器性能，显著优于仅依赖上下文数据的学习器（需要Ω(d/R^4)个示例）。

Conclusion: transformer能够作为接近最优的元学习器，其所需的训练任务数量和每任务示例数与环境维度d无关，证明了transformer在元学习中的理论有效性。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated impressive in-context learning (ICL)
capabilities, raising the question of whether they can serve as metalearners
that adapt to new tasks using only a small number of in-context examples,
without any further training. While recent theoretical work has studied
transformers' ability to perform ICL, most of these analyses do not address the
formal metalearning setting, where the objective is to solve a collection of
related tasks more efficiently than would be possible by solving each task
individually. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical analysis showing
that a simplified transformer architecture trained via gradient descent can act
as a near-optimal metalearner in a linear classification setting. We consider a
natural family of tasks where each task corresponds to a class-conditional
Gaussian mixture model, with the mean vectors lying in a shared $k$-dimensional
subspace of $R^d$. After training on a sufficient number of such tasks, we show
that the transformer can generalize to a new task using only $O(k / R^4)$
in-context examples, where $R$ denotes the signal strength at test time. This
performance (almost) matches that of an optimal learner that knows exactly the
shared subspace and significantly outperforms any learner that only has access
to the in-context data, which requires $\Omega(d / R^4)$ examples to
generalize. Importantly, our bounds on the number of training tasks and
examples per task needed to achieve this result are independent of the ambient
dimension $d$.

Motivation: 大型语言模型训练的计算需求加剧了全球南北之间的结构性不对称，研究旨在探索全球南方国家在硬件、能源和财政约束下建立主权AI能力的可行性。

Method: 采用双轴设计，比较不同加速器（H100 vs A100）和训练时长（90天 vs 150天），评估计算需求、能耗、资本支出和监管兼容性。

Result: 所有配置都低于出口管制和电力基础设施阈值，H100方案总成本为800-1400万美元，A100方案为1900-3200万美元，硬件效率决定财政可行性。

Conclusion: 延长训练时间应作为缓解硬件约束的政策杠杆，使中等收入国家能够建立可持续且战略上足够的AI能力，生产可用、可审计且本地对齐的模型。

Abstract: The rapid escalation of computational requirements for training large-scale
language models has reinforced structural asymmetries between high-capacity
jurisdictions and countries in the Global South. This paper examines the
technical and fiscal feasibility of sovereign-scale language model training in
Brazil and Mexico under conditions of constrained hardware access, energy
availability, and fiscal ceilings. Using a dual-axis design that varies
accelerator generation (NVIDIA H100 vs. A100) and training duration (90 vs. 150
days), we estimate compute demand, energy consumption, capital expenditures,
and regulatory compatibility for the training of a 10-trillion-token model. Our
findings show that while all configurations remain below export-control and
electrical infrastructure thresholds, fiscal viability is determined by
hardware efficiency. H100-based scenarios achieve training feasibility at a
total cost of 8-14 million USD, while A100 deployments require 19-32 million
USD due to higher energy and hardware demand. We argue that extending training
timelines should be treated as a policy lever to mitigate hardware constraints,
enabling the production of usable, auditable, and locally aligned models
without competing at the global frontier. This study contributes to the
discourse on AI compute governance and technological sovereignty by
highlighting context-sensitive strategies that allow middle-income countries to
establish sustainable and strategically sufficient AI capabilities.

Motivation: 生物大脑中的结构可塑性对有效学习、损伤恢复和资源优化至关重要，但当前机器学习框架主要针对密集连接优化，修剪无法减少训练成本。

Method: 基于GeNN模拟器开发GPU加速结构可塑性框架，使用e-prop监督学习规则和DEEP R训练稀疏SNN分类器，并在无监督学习环境中学习拓扑映射。

Result: 稀疏分类器训练时间减少高达10倍，DEEP R重连使其性能与原始模型相当；实现了超实时拓扑映射形成，提供了连接演化的洞察。

Conclusion: 该框架将促进网络结构和神经通信中稀疏性的实现与维护研究，以及探索稀疏性在各种神经形态应用中的计算优势。

Abstract: The majority of research in both training Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)
and modeling learning in biological brains focuses on synaptic plasticity,
where learning equates to changing the strength of existing connections.
However, in biological brains, structural plasticity - where new connections
are created and others removed - is also vital, not only for effective learning
but also for recovery from damage and optimal resource usage. Inspired by
structural plasticity, pruning is often used in machine learning to remove weak
connections from trained models to reduce the computational requirements of
inference. However, the machine learning frameworks typically used for
backpropagation-based training of both ANNs and Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)
are optimized for dense connectivity, meaning that pruning does not help reduce
the training costs of ever-larger models. The GeNN simulator already supports
efficient GPU-accelerated simulation of sparse SNNs for computational
neuroscience and machine learning. Here, we present a new flexible framework
for implementing GPU-accelerated structural plasticity rules and demonstrate
this first using the e-prop supervised learning rule and DEEP R to train
efficient, sparse SNN classifiers and then, in an unsupervised learning
context, to learn topographic maps. Compared to baseline dense models, our
sparse classifiers reduce training time by up to 10x while the DEEP R rewiring
enables them to perform as well as the original models. We demonstrate
topographic map formation in faster-than-realtime simulations, provide insights
into the connectivity evolution, and measure simulation speed versus network
size. The proposed framework will enable further research into achieving and
maintaining sparsity in network structure and neural communication, as well as
exploring the computational benefits of sparsity in a range of neuromorphic
applications.

Abstract: Graph vertex ordering is widely employed in spatial data analysis, especially
in urban analytics, where street graphs serve as spatial discretization for
modeling and simulation. It is also crucial for visualization, as many methods
require vertices to be arranged in a well-defined order to reveal non-trivial
patterns. The goal of vertex ordering methods is to preserve neighborhood
relations, but the structural complexity of real-world graphs often introduces
distortions. Comparing different ordering methods is therefore essential to
identify the most suitable one for each application. Existing metrics for
assessing spatial vertex ordering typically focus on global quality, which
hinders the identification of localized distortions. Visual evaluation is
particularly valuable, as it allows analysts to compare methods within a single
visualization, assess distortions, identify anomalous regions, and, in urban
contexts, explain spatial inconsistencies. This work presents a
visualization-assisted tool for assessing vertex ordering techniques, with a
focus on urban analytics. We evaluate geometric and topological ordering
approaches using urban street graphs. The visual tool integrates existing and
newly proposed metrics, validated through experiments on data from multiple
cities. Results demonstrate that the proposed methodology effectively supports
users in selecting suitable vertex ordering techniques, tuning hyperparameters,
and identifying regions with high ordering distortions.

Conclusion: AMAuT为计算资源受限环境提供了高效灵活的替代方案，使最先进的音频分类技术更加可及。

Abstract: Recent foundational models, SSAST, EAT, HuBERT, Qwen-Audio, and Audio
Flamingo, achieve top-tier results across standard audio benchmarks but are
limited by fixed input rates and durations, hindering their reusability. This
paper introduces the Augmentation-driven Multiview Audio Transformer (AMAuT), a
training-from-scratch framework that eliminates the dependency on pre-trained
weights while supporting arbitrary sample rates and audio lengths. AMAuT
integrates four key components: (1) augmentation-driven multiview learning for
robustness, (2) a conv1 + conv7 + conv1 one-dimensional CNN bottleneck for
stable temporal encoding, (3) dual CLS + TAL tokens for bidirectional context
representation, and (4) test-time adaptation/augmentation (TTA^2) to improve
inference reliability. Experiments on five public benchmarks, AudioMNIST,
SpeechCommands V1 & V2, VocalSound, and CochlScene, show that AMAuT achieves
accuracies up to 99.8% while consuming less than 3% of the GPU hours required
by comparable pre-trained models. Thus, AMAuT presents a highly efficient and
flexible alternative to large pre-trained models, making state-of-the-art audio
classification accessible in computationally constrained settings.

Motivation: 传统频率分析和机器学习方法常常忽略声音的细微特征，而拓扑数据分析能捕捉复杂模式，但在音色分析中的应用有限，主要因为不清楚如何为TDA有效表示声音。

Method: 使用合成和真实音频信号，研究不同时间延迟嵌入对TDA结果的影响，识别能增强谐波结构检测的时间延迟。

Conclusion: 该方法为未来研究开辟了道路，可通过使用高维嵌入和额外持久性统计量扩展到更复杂的声音分析。

Abstract: Timbre allows us to distinguish between sounds even when they share the same
pitch and loudness, playing an important role in music, instrument recognition,
and speech. Traditional approaches, such as frequency analysis or machine
learning, often overlook subtle characteristics of sound. Topological Data
Analysis (TDA) can capture complex patterns, but its application to timbre has
been limited, partly because it is unclear how to represent sound effectively
for TDA. In this study, we investigate how different time delay embeddings
affect TDA results. Using both synthetic and real audio signals, we identify
time delays that enhance the detection of harmonic structures. Our findings
show that specific delays, related to fractions of the fundamental period,
allow TDA to reveal key harmonic features and distinguish between integer and
non-integer harmonics. The method is effective for synthetic and real musical
instrument sounds and opens the way for future works, which could extend it to
more complex sounds using higher-dimensional embeddings and additional
persistence statistics.

Abstract: Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSRs) near the lunar poles are of interest for
future exploration due to their potential to contain water ice and preserve
geological records. Their complex, uneven terrain favors the use of legged
robots, which can traverse challenging surfaces while collecting in-situ data,
and have proven effective in Earth analogs, including dark caves, when equipped
with onboard lighting. While exteroceptive sensors like cameras and lidars can
capture terrain geometry and even semantic information, they cannot quantify
its physical interaction with the robot, a capability provided by
proprioceptive sensing. We propose a terrain mapping framework for quadruped
robots, which estimates elevation, foot slippage, energy cost, and stability
margins from internal sensing during locomotion. These metrics are
incrementally integrated into a multi-layer 2.5D gridmap that reflects terrain
interaction from the robot's perspective. The system is evaluated in a
simulator that mimics a lunar environment, using the 21 kg quadruped robot
Aliengo, showing consistent mapping performance under lunar gravity and terrain
conditions.

acoustic range sensors, which provide 2D information including, at-best,
spatially ambiguous information. This paper, to the best of our knowledge, is
the first study examining the performance, capacity, and opportunities arising
from the recent introduction of the first compact 3D sonar. Towards that
purpose, we introduce calibration procedures for extracting the extrinsics
between the 3D sonar and a camera and we provide a study on acoustic response
in different surfaces and materials. Moreover, we provide novel mapping and
SLAM pipelines tested in deployments in underwater cave systems and other
geometrically and acoustically challenging underwater environments. Our
assessment showcases the unique capacity of 3D sonars to capture consistent
spatial information allowing for detailed reconstructions and localization in
datasets expanding to hundreds of meters. At the same time it highlights
remaining challenges related to acoustic propagation, as found also in other
acoustic sensors. Datasets collected for our evaluations would be released and
shared with the community to enable further research advancements.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation in 3D is a fundamental problem for autonomy. Despite
major advancements in terrestrial and aerial settings due to improved range
sensors including LiDAR, compact sensors with similar capabilities for
underwater robots have only recently become available, in the form of 3D
sonars. This paper introduces a novel underwater 3D navigation pipeline, called
SHRUMS (Sensor Hallucination for Robust Underwater Motion planning with 3D
Sonar). To the best of the authors' knowledge, SHRUMS is the first underwater
autonomous navigation stack to integrate a 3D sonar. The proposed pipeline
exhibits strong robustness while operating in complex 3D environments in spite
of extremely poor visibility conditions. To accommodate the intricacies of the
novel sensor data stream while achieving real-time locally optimal performance,
SHRUMS introduces the concept of hallucinating sensor measurements from
non-existent sensors with convenient arbitrary parameters, tailored to
application specific requirements. The proposed concepts are validated with
real 3D sonar sensor data, utilizing real inputs in challenging settings and
local maps constructed in real-time. Field deployments validating the proposed
approach in full are planned in the very near future.

Conclusion: 为机器人和计算机视觉的下游任务提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Estimation of signed distance functions (SDFs) from point cloud data has been
shown to benefit many robot autonomy capabilities, including localization,
mapping, motion planning, and control. Methods that support online and
large-scale SDF reconstruction tend to rely on discrete volumetric data
structures, which affect the continuity and differentiability of the SDF
estimates. Recently, using implicit features, neural network methods have
demonstrated high-fidelity and differentiable SDF reconstruction but they tend
to be less efficient, can experience catastrophic forgetting and memory
limitations in large environments, and are often restricted to truncated SDFs.
This work proposes $\nabla$-SDF, a hybrid method that combines an explicit
prior obtained from gradient-augmented octree interpolation with an implicit
neural residual. Our method achieves non-truncated (Euclidean) SDF
reconstruction with computational and memory efficiency comparable to
volumetric methods and differentiability and accuracy comparable to neural
network methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \methodname{}
outperforms the state of the art in terms of accuracy and efficiency, providing
a scalable solution for downstream tasks in robotics and computer vision.

Result: 将提出的运动规划器实现为ROS导航包的扩展，并在仿真和物理机器人上进行了系统评估。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效处理4WIS系统的转向约束和运动不连续性问题，实现平滑高效的运动规划与控制。

Abstract: This paper addresses motion planning and con- trol of an overactuated 4-wheel
drive train with independent steering (4WIS) where mechanical constraints
prevent the wheels from executing full 360-degree rotations (swerve). The
configuration space of such a robot is constrained and contains discontinuities
that affect the smoothness of the robot motion. We introduce a mathematical
formulation of the steering constraints and derive discontinuity planes that
partition the velocity space into regions of smooth and efficient motion. We
further design the motion planner for path tracking and ob- stacle avoidance
that explicitly accounts for swerve constraints and the velocity transition
smoothness. The motion controller uses local feedback to generate actuation
from the desired velocity, while properly handling the discontinuity crossing
by temporarily stopping the motion and repositioning the wheels. We implement
the proposed motion planner as an extension to ROS Navigation package and
evaluate the system in simulation and on a physical robot.

Abstract: Conjunction analysis and maneuver planning for spacecraft collision avoidance
remains a manual and time-consuming process, typically involving repeated
forward simulations of hand-designed maneuvers. With the growing density of
satellites in low-Earth orbit (LEO), autonomy is becoming essential for
efficiently evaluating and mitigating collisions. In this work, we present an
algorithm to design low-thrust collision-avoidance maneuvers for short-term
conjunction events. We first formulate the problem as a nonconvex
quadratically-constrained quadratic program (QCQP), which we then relax into a
convex semidefinite program (SDP) using Shor's relaxation. We demonstrate
empirically that the relaxation is tight, which enables the recovery of
globally optimal solutions to the original nonconvex problem. Our formulation
produces a minimum-energy solution while ensuring a desired probability of
collision at the time of closest approach. Finally, if the desired probability
of collision cannot be satisfied, we relax this constraint into a penalty,
yielding a minimum-risk solution. We validate our algorithm with a
high-fidelity simulation of a satellite conjunction in low-Earth orbit with a
simulated conjunction data message (CDM), demonstrating its effectiveness in
reducing collision risk.

Abstract: The functionality and natural motion of prosthetic hands remain limited by
the challenges in controlling compliant wrist mechanisms. Current control
strategies often lack adaptability and incur high computational costs, which
impedes real-time deployment in assistive robotics. To address this gap, this
study presents a computationally efficient Neural Network (NN)-based Model
Reference Adaptive Controller (MRAC) for a tendon-driven soft continuum wrist
integrated with a prosthetic hand. The dynamic modeling of the wrist is
formulated using Timoshenko beam theory, capturing both shear and bending
deformations. The proposed NN-MRAC estimates the required tendon forces from
deflection errors and minimizes deviation from a reference model through online
adaptation. Simulation results demonstrate improved precision with a root mean
square error (RMSE) of $6.14 \times 10^{-4}$ m and a settling time of $3.2$s.
Experimental validations confirm real-time applicability, with an average RMSE
of $5.66 \times 10^{-3}$ m, steady-state error of $8.05 \times 10^{-3}$ m, and
settling time of $1.58$ s. These results highlight the potential of the
controller to enhance motion accuracy and responsiveness in soft prosthetic
systems, thereby advancing the integration of adaptive intelligent control in
wearable assistive devices.

Abstract: This paper investigates a sample-based solution to the hybrid mode control
problem across non-differentiable and algorithmic hybrid modes. Our approach
reasons about a set of hybrid control modes as an integer-based optimization
problem where we select what mode to apply, when to switch to another mode, and
the duration for which we are in a given control mode. A sample-based variation
is derived to efficiently search the integer domain for optimal solutions. We
find our formulation yields strong performance guarantees that can be applied
to a number of robotics-related tasks. In addition, our approach is able to

Abstract: Recent advances in robotics and autonomous systems have broadened the use of
robots in laboratory settings, including automated synthesis, scalable reaction
workflows, and collaborative tasks in self-driving laboratories (SDLs). This
paper presents a comprehensive development of a mobile manipulator designed to
assist human operators in such autonomous lab environments. Kinematic modeling
of the manipulator is carried out based on the Denavit Hartenberg (DH)
convention and inverse kinematics solution is determined to enable precise and
adaptive manipulation capabilities. A key focus of this research is enhancing
the manipulator ability to reliably grasp textured objects as a critical
component of autonomous handling tasks. Advanced vision-based algorithms are
implemented to perform real-time object detection and pose estimation, guiding
the manipulator in dynamic grasping and following tasks. In this work, we
integrate a vision method that combines feature-based detection with
homography-driven pose estimation, leveraging depth information to represent an
object pose as a $2$D planar projection within $3$D space. This adaptive
capability enables the system to accommodate variations in object orientation
and supports robust autonomous manipulation across diverse environments. By
enabling autonomous experimentation and human-robot collaboration, this work
contributes to the scalability and reproducibility of next-generation chemical
laboratories

Abstract: Legged robots can sense terrain through force interactions during locomotion,
offering more reliable traversability estimates than remote sensing and serving
as scouts for guiding wheeled rovers in challenging environments. However, even
legged scouts face challenges when traversing highly deformable or unstable
terrain. We present Safe Active Exploration for Granular Terrain (SAEGT), a
navigation framework that enables legged robots to safely explore unknown
granular environments using proprioceptive sensing, particularly where visual
input fails to capture terrain deformability. SAEGT estimates the safe region
and frontier region online from leg-terrain interactions using Gaussian Process
regression for traversability assessment, with a reactive controller for
real-time safe exploration and navigation. SAEGT demonstrated its ability to
safely explore and navigate toward a specified goal using only proprioceptively
estimated traversability in simulation.

Motivation: 解决高维复杂环境中机器人路径规划的计算效率低、安全性差和泛化能力不足的问题，传统方法计算时间长且需要大量参数调优，而现有学习方法泛化效果不佳。

Conclusion: GADGET框架为机器人路径规划提供了一种高效、安全且可泛化的解决方案，支持零样本迁移到新环境和机器人硬件，在真实世界设置中表现出色。

Abstract: Path planning for a robotic system in high-dimensional cluttered environments
needs to be efficient, safe, and adaptable for different environments and
hardware. Conventional methods face high computation time and require extensive
parameter tuning, while prior learning-based methods still fail to generalize
effectively. The primary goal of this research is to develop a path planning
framework capable of generalizing to unseen environments and new robotic
manipulators without the need for retraining. We present GADGET (Generalizable
and Adaptive Diffusion-Guided Environment-aware Trajectory generation), a
diffusion-based planning model that generates joint-space trajectories
conditioned on voxelized scene representations as well as start and goal
configurations. A key innovation is GADGET's hybrid dual-conditioning mechanism
that combines classifier-free guidance via learned scene encoding with
classifier-guided Control Barrier Function (CBF) safety shaping, integrating
environment awareness with real-time collision avoidance directly in the
denoising process. This design supports zero-shot transfer to new environments
and robotic embodiments without retraining. Experimental results show that
GADGET achieves high success rates with low collision intensity in
spherical-obstacle, bin-picking, and shelf environments, with CBF guidance
further improving safety. Moreover, comparative evaluations indicate strong
performance relative to both sampling-based and learning-based baselines.
Furthermore, GADGET provides transferability across Franka Panda, Kinova Gen3
(6/7-DoF), and UR5 robots, and physical execution on a Kinova Gen3 demonstrates
its ability to generate safe, collision-free trajectories in real-world
settings.

Conclusion: GRASPLAT证明了仅使用RGB图像训练就能实现有效的多指灵巧抓取，克服了获取3D数据的限制，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Achieving dexterous robotic grasping with multi-fingered hands remains a
significant challenge. While existing methods rely on complete 3D scans to
predict grasp poses, these approaches face limitations due to the difficulty of
acquiring high-quality 3D data in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we
introduce GRASPLAT, a novel grasping framework that leverages consistent 3D
information while being trained solely on RGB images. Our key insight is that
by synthesizing physically plausible images of a hand grasping an object, we
can regress the corresponding hand joints for a successful grasp. To achieve
this, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting to generate high-fidelity novel views of
real hand-object interactions, enabling end-to-end training with RGB data.
Unlike prior methods, our approach incorporates a photometric loss that refines
grasp predictions by minimizing discrepancies between rendered and real images.
We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world grasping
datasets, demonstrating that GRASPLAT improves grasp success rates up to 36.9%
over existing image-based methods. Project page:

Conclusion: 提出的分层框架能够有效解决DLOs的长时程路由任务，具有良好的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Long-horizon routing tasks of deformable linear objects (DLOs), such as
cables and ropes, are common in industrial assembly lines and everyday life.
These tasks are particularly challenging because they require robots to
manipulate DLO with long-horizon planning and reliable skill execution.
Successfully completing such tasks demands adapting to their nonlinear
dynamics, decomposing abstract routing goals, and generating multi-step plans
composed of multiple skills, all of which require accurate high-level reasoning
during execution. In this paper, we propose a fully autonomous hierarchical
framework for solving challenging DLO routing tasks. Given an implicit or
explicit routing goal expressed in language, our framework leverages
vision-language models~(VLMs) for in-context high-level reasoning to synthesize
feasible plans, which are then executed by low-level skills trained via
reinforcement learning. To improve robustness in long horizons, we further
introduce a failure recovery mechanism that reorients the DLO into
insertion-feasible states. Our approach generalizes to diverse scenes involving
object attributes, spatial descriptions, as well as implicit language commands.
It outperforms the next best baseline method by nearly 50% and achieves an
overall success rate of 92.5% across long-horizon routing scenarios.

Conclusion: TARMAC为更灵活和自主的实验室自动化提供了结构化基础，通过系统化的操作技能分类解决了当前实验室机器人自主性受限的问题。

Abstract: Chemistry laboratory automation aims to increase throughput, reproducibility,
and safety, yet many existing systems still depend on frequent human
intervention. Advances in robotics have reduced this dependency, but without a
structured representation of the required skills, autonomy remains limited to
bespoke, task-specific solutions with little capacity to transfer beyond their
initial design. Current experiment abstractions typically describe
protocol-level steps without specifying the robotic actions needed to execute
them. This highlights the lack of a systematic account of the manipulation
skills required for robots in chemistry laboratories. To address this gap, we
introduce TARMAC - a Taxonomy for Robot Manipulation in Chemistry - a
domain-specific framework that defines and organizes the core manipulations
needed in laboratory practice. Based on annotated teaching-lab demonstrations
and supported by experimental validation, TARMAC categorizes actions according
to their functional role and physical execution requirements. Beyond serving as
a descriptive vocabulary, TARMAC can be instantiated as robot-executable
primitives and composed into higher-level macros, enabling skill reuse and
supporting scalable integration into long-horizon workflows. These
contributions provide a structured foundation for more flexible and autonomous
laboratory automation. More information is available at

Abstract: The wide application of flow-matching methods has greatly promoted the
development of robot imitation learning. However, these methods all face the
problem of high inference time. To address this issue, researchers have
proposed distillation methods and consistency methods, but the performance of
these methods still struggles to compete with that of the original diffusion
models and flow-matching models. In this article, we propose a one-step
shortcut method with multi-step integration for robot imitation learning. To
balance the inference speed and performance, we extend the multi-step
consistency loss on the basis of the shortcut model, split the one-step loss
into multi-step losses, and improve the performance of one-step inference.
Secondly, to solve the problem of unstable optimization of the multi-step loss
and the original flow-matching loss, we propose an adaptive gradient allocation
method to enhance the stability of the learning process. Finally, we evaluate
the proposed method in two simulation benchmarks and five real-world
environment tasks. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the
proposed algorithm.

Abstract: The growing interest in ocean discovery imposes a need for inspection and

addition to its ability to change its body configurations, makes articulated
underwater robots an adequate option for such environments. However, operation

proposes a Bayesian approach to assess the risks of losing Eely during two

the likelihood of mission success. Sensitivity analysis results are presented
in order to demonstrate the causes having the highest impact on losing Eely.

Abstract: Uncertainty-aware robot motion prediction is crucial for downstream
traversability estimation and safe autonomous navigation in unstructured,
off-road environments, where terrain is heterogeneous and perceptual
uncertainty is high. Most existing methods assume deterministic or spatially
independent terrain uncertainties, ignoring the inherent local correlations of
3D spatial data and often producing unreliable predictions. In this work, we
introduce an efficient probabilistic framework that explicitly models spatially
correlated aleatoric uncertainty over terrain parameters as a probabilistic
world model and propagates this uncertainty through a differentiable physics
engine for probabilistic trajectory forecasting. By leveraging structured
convolutional operators, our approach provides high-resolution multivariate
predictions at manageable computational cost. Experimental evaluation on a
publicly available dataset shows significantly improved uncertainty estimation
and trajectory prediction accuracy over aleatoric uncertainty estimation
baselines.

Conclusion: 该方法能更有效地利用多任务策略的模型容量，并在真实机器人平台上验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Increasingly large datasets of robot actions and sensory observations are
being collected to train ever-larger neural networks. These datasets are
collected based on tasks and while these tasks may be distinct in their
descriptions, many involve very similar physical action sequences (e.g., 'pick
up an apple' versus 'pick up an orange'). As a result, many datasets of robotic
tasks are substantially imbalanced in terms of the physical robotic actions
they represent. In this work, we propose a simple sampling strategy for policy
training that mitigates this imbalance. Our method requires only a few lines of
code to integrate into existing codebases and improves generalization. We
evaluate our method in both pre-training small models and fine-tuning large
foundational models. Our results show substantial improvements on low-resource
tasks compared to prior state-of-the-art methods, without degrading performance
on high-resource tasks. This enables more effective use of model capacity for
multi-task policies. We also further validate our approach in a real-world
setup on a Franka Panda robot arm across a diverse set of tasks.

Motivation: 解决视觉-语言-动作模型训练需要大规模真实机器人数据的问题，这些数据收集成本高且耗时，限制了VLA系统的可扩展性和泛化能力。

Method: 利用世界模型生成多样化数据（视频生成、真实到真实转换、人类转换、视角转换、仿真到真实转换），结合RGBD输入建模和具身思维链监督，增强空间几何、物体状态和长时程依赖关系的推理能力。

Result: 在灵巧操作、长时程任务和移动操作任务上显著提升真实世界性能，在外观、物体位置和相机视角变化方面表现出优越的泛化能力，并开发了轻量级变体GigaBrain-0-Small。

Conclusion: 通过世界模型生成数据的方法有效减少了真实机器人数据需求，同时显著提升了模型的泛化能力和实际性能，为高效VLA模型训练提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Training Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for generalist robots typically
requires large-scale real-world robot data, which is expensive and
time-consuming to collect. The inefficiency of physical data collection
severely limits the scalability, and generalization capacity of current VLA
systems. To address this challenge, we introduce GigaBrain-0, a novel VLA
foundation model empowered by world model-generated data (e.g., video
generation, real2real transfer, human transfer, view transfer, sim2real
transfer data). By leveraging world models to generate diverse data at scale,
GigaBrain-0 significantly reduces reliance on real robot data while improving
cross-task generalization. Our approach further improves policy robustness
through RGBD input modeling and embodied Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision,
enabling the model to reason about spatial geometry, object states, and
long-horizon dependencies during task execution. This leads to substantial
gains in real-world performance on dexterous, long-horizon, and mobile
manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GigaBrain-0 achieves
superior generalization across variations in appearances (e.g., textures,
colors), object placements, and camera viewpoints. Additionally, we present
GigaBrain-0-Small, an optimized lightweight variant designed to run efficiently
on devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin.

Abstract: Imitation learning has proven effective for training robots to perform
complex tasks from expert human demonstrations. However, it remains limited by
its reliance on high-quality, task-specific data, restricting adaptability to
the diverse range of real-world object configurations and scenarios. In
contrast, non-expert data -- such as play data, suboptimal demonstrations,
partial task completions, or rollouts from suboptimal policies -- can offer
broader coverage and lower collection costs. However, conventional imitation
learning approaches fail to utilize this data effectively. To address these
challenges, we posit that with right design decisions, offline reinforcement
learning can be used as a tool to harness non-expert data to enhance the
performance of imitation learning policies. We show that while standard offline
RL approaches can be ineffective at actually leveraging non-expert data under
the sparse data coverage settings typically encountered in the real world,
simple algorithmic modifications can allow for the utilization of this data,
without significant additional assumptions. Our approach shows that broadening
the support of the policy distribution can allow imitation algorithms augmented
by offline RL to solve tasks robustly, showing considerably enhanced recovery
and generalization behavior. In manipulation tasks, these innovations
significantly increase the range of initial conditions where learned policies
are successful when non-expert data is incorporated. Moreover, we show that
these methods are able to leverage all collected data, including partial or
suboptimal demonstrations, to bolster task-directed policy performance. This
underscores the importance of algorithmic techniques for using non-expert data
for robust policy learning in robotics.

Abstract: The integration of advanced control strategies into prosthetic hands is
essential to improve their adaptability and performance. In this study, we
present an implementation of a Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy to
regulate the motions of a soft continuum wrist section attached to a
tendon-driven prosthetic hand with less computational effort. MPC plays a
crucial role in enhancing the functionality and responsiveness of prosthetic
hands. By leveraging predictive modeling, this approach enables precise
movement adjustments while accounting for dynamic user interactions. This
advanced control strategy allows for the anticipation of future movements and
adjustments based on the current state of the prosthetic device and the
intentions of the user. Kinematic and dynamic modelings are performed using
Euler-Bernoulli beam and Lagrange methods respectively. Through simulation and
experimental validations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MPC in optimizing
wrist articulation and user control. Our findings suggest that this technique
significantly improves the prosthetic hand dexterity, making movements more
natural and intuitive. This research contributes to the field of robotics and
biomedical engineering by offering a promising direction for intelligent
prosthetic systems.

Motivation: 解决零样本视觉语言导航中环境特定路径点预测器限制场景泛化，以及大模型推理能力在导航中未充分利用的问题。

Method: 提出层次化动作分解：语言动作用于高级规划，视觉动作用于感知接地，机器人动作用于鲁棒导航，利用不同规模多模态大语言模型的优势。

Result: 在VLN-CE基准测试中显著优于现有最先进方法，在未见环境中展现出优越的泛化能力。

Conclusion: LaViRA框架通过模块化分解实现了强大的推理、接地和实际控制能力，同时保持透明度和效率，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Zero-shot Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE)
requires an agent to navigate unseen environments based on natural language
instructions without any prior training. Current methods face a critical
trade-off: either rely on environment-specific waypoint predictors that limit
scene generalization, or underutilize the reasoning capabilities of large
models during navigation. We introduce LaViRA, a simple yet effective zero-shot
framework that addresses this dilemma by decomposing action into a
coarse-to-fine hierarchy: Language Action for high-level planning, Vision
Action for perceptual grounding, and Robot Action for robust navigation. This
modular decomposition allows us to leverage the distinct strengths of different
scales of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) at each stage, creating a
system that is powerful in its reasoning, grounding and practical control.
LaViRA significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the
VLN-CE benchmark, demonstrating superior generalization capabilities in unseen
environments, while maintaining transparency and efficiency for real-world
deployment.

Abstract: A novel approach for the fast onboard detection of isolated markers for
visual relative localisation of multiple teammates in agile UAV swarms is
introduced in this paper. As the detection forms a key component of real-time
localisation systems, a three-fold innovation is presented, consisting of an
optimised procedure for CPUs, a GPU shader program, and a functionally
equivalent FPGA streaming architecture. For the proposed CPU and GPU solutions,
the mean processing time per pixel of input camera frames was accelerated by
two to three orders of magnitude compared to the state of the art. For the
localisation task, the proposed FPGA architecture offered the most significant
overall acceleration by minimising the total delay from camera exposure to
detection results. Additionally, the proposed solutions were evaluated on
various 32-bit and 64-bit embedded platforms to demonstrate their efficiency,
as well as their feasibility for applications using low-end UAVs and MAVs.
Thus, it has become a crucial enabling technology for agile UAV swarming.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLA模型缺乏在执行失败时动态调整行为的能力，无法像人类一样从失败中学习并改进策略。

Method: 连接低级VLA策略与高级VLM，通过推理阶段生成执行计划，评估阶段反思执行结果并提取有用结论用于未来推理。

Result: LITEN能够有效从过去经验中学习，生成使用高可用性指令的计划来完成长时程任务。

Conclusion: LITEN为机器人提供了从失败中学习并动态调整策略的能力，显著提升了复杂控制任务的解决能力。

Abstract: Solving complex real-world control tasks often takes multiple tries: if we
fail at first, we reflect on what went wrong, and change our strategy
accordingly to avoid making the same mistake. In robotics,
Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) offer a promising path towards solving
complex control tasks, but lack the ability to contextually and dynamically
readjust behavior when they fail to accomplish a task. In this work, we
introduce Learning from Inference-Time Execution (LITEN), which connects a VLA
low-level policy to a high-level VLM that conditions on past experiences by
including them in-context, allowing it to learn the affordances and
capabilities of the low-level VLA. Our approach iterates between a reasoning
phase that generates and executes plans for the low-level VLA, and an
assessment phase that reflects on the resulting execution and draws useful
conclusions to be included in future reasoning contexts. Unlike similar
approaches to self-refinement in non-robotics domains, LITEN must reflect on
unstructured real-world robot trajectories (e.g., raw videos), which requires
structured guiderails during assessment. Our experimental results demonstrate
LITEN is able to effectively learn from past experience to generate plans that
use high-affordance instructions to accomplish long-horizon tasks.

Result: 实验结果显示该方法在相同时间限制下显著优于最先进的探索策略，获得更好的全局地图覆盖率

Conclusion: SEA方法通过语义地图预测和强化学习实现了更高效的机器人探索

Abstract: In this paper, we propose SEA, a novel approach for active robot exploration
through semantic map prediction and a reinforcement learning-based hierarchical
exploration policy. Unlike existing learning-based methods that rely on
one-step waypoint prediction, our approach enhances the agent's long-term
environmental understanding to facilitate more efficient exploration. We
propose an iterative prediction-exploration framework that explicitly predicts
the missing areas of the map based on current observations. The difference
between the actual accumulated map and the predicted global map is then used to
guide exploration. Additionally, we design a novel reward mechanism that
leverages reinforcement learning to update the long-term exploration
strategies, enabling us to construct an accurate semantic map within limited
steps. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art exploration strategies, achieving superior
coverage ares of the global map within the same time constraints.

Abstract: Urban air pollution poses significant risks to public health, environmental
sustainability, and policy planning. Effective air quality management requires
predictive tools that can integrate diverse datasets and communicate complex

interactive machine learning ML sandbox tool designed to predict and visualize
pollutant concentrations at the ground level using multi-source data, which
includes satellite observations, meteorological parameters, population density,
elevation, and nighttime lights. While traditional air quality visualization
tools often lack forecasting capabilities, CityAQVis enables users to build and
compare predictive models, visualizing the model outputs and offering insights
into pollution dynamics at the ground level. The pilot implementation of the
tool is tested through case studies predicting nitrogen dioxide (NO2)
concentrations in metropolitan regions, highlighting its adaptability to
various pollutants. Through an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI), the
user can perform comparative visualizations of the spatial distribution of
surface-level pollutant concentration in two different urban scenarios. Our

Motivation: 在现代信息环境中，健康问题咨询可能令人望而生畏。大型语言模型虽然能提供定制化、可访问的信息，但也存在不准确、有偏见或误导性的风险。

Method: 进行了4项混合方法研究（总共163名参与者），包括定性研究来了解人们如何与LLMs互动处理健康问题，并开发了主动寻求上下文的"导航AI"进行随机盲法研究。

Result: 定性研究显示，LLMs主动寻求上下文信息受到参与者重视，即使这意味着需要多次对话才能获得答案。在随机研究中，参与者认为导航AI比基线AI更有帮助、更相关且更贴合他们的关切。

Conclusion: 主动寻求上下文对对话动态有强烈影响，为对话AI设计提供了帮助导航健康话题的模式。

Abstract: Navigating health questions can be daunting in the modern information
landscape. Large language models (LLMs) may provide tailored, accessible
information, but also risk being inaccurate, biased or misleading. We present
insights from 4 mixed-methods studies (total N=163), examining how people
interact with LLMs for their own health questions. Qualitative studies revealed
the importance of context-seeking in conversational AIs to elicit specific
details a person may not volunteer or know to share. Context-seeking by LLMs
was valued by participants, even if it meant deferring an answer for several
turns. Incorporating these insights, we developed a "Wayfinding AI" to
proactively solicit context. In a randomized, blinded study, participants rated
the Wayfinding AI as more helpful, relevant, and tailored to their concerns
compared to a baseline AI. These results demonstrate the strong impact of
proactive context-seeking on conversational dynamics, and suggest design
patterns for conversational AI to help navigate health topics.

Motivation: AI辅助作弊已成为在线考试的重大威胁，高级浏览器扩展能让LLMs在几秒内回答考试问题，危及考试安全性。

Method: 分析52名学生在监考面对面在线考试中的行为数据，定义可疑行为（选择文本、右键点击、失去焦点），使用k-Means聚类方法对学生进行分类。

Result: 学生被分为6个聚类，其中4个聚类（约33%样本）表现出不同程度的可疑行为。有可疑行为的学生平均成绩比无行为学生高30-40分。

Conclusion: 尽管需要进一步验证，但这项初步研究为使用行为分析检测在线考试中AI辅助作弊提供了重要见解。

Abstract: AI-assisted cheating has emerged as a significant threat in the context of
online exams. Advanced browser extensions now enable large language models
(LLMs) to answer questions presented in online exams within seconds, thereby
compromising the security of these assessments. In this study, the behaviors of
students (N = 52) on an online exam platform during a proctored, face-to-face
exam were analyzed using clustering methods, with the aim of identifying groups
of students exhibiting suspicious behavior potentially associated with
cheating. Additionally, students in different clusters were compared in terms
of their exam scores. Suspicious exam behaviors in this study were defined as
selecting text within the question area, right-clicking, and losing focus on
the exam page. The total frequency of these behaviors performed by each student
during the exam was extracted, and k-Means clustering was employed for the
analysis. The findings revealed that students were classified into six clusters
based on their suspicious behaviors. It was found that students in four of the
six clusters, representing approximately 33% of the total sample, exhibited
suspicious behaviors at varying levels. When the exam scores of these students
were compared, it was observed that those who engaged in suspicious behaviors
scored, on average, 30-40 points higher than those who did not. Although
further research is necessary to validate these findings, this preliminary
study provides significant insights into the detection of AI-assisted cheating
in online exams using behavior analytics.

users. We present the Plural Voices Model (PVM), a novel single-agent framework
that dynamically negotiates multi-user needs through real-time value alignment,
leveraging diverse public datasets on mental health, eldercare, education, and
moral reasoning. Using human+synthetic curriculum design with fairness-aware
scenarios and ethical enhancements, PVM identifies core values, conflicts, and
accessibility requirements to inform inclusive principles. Our privacy-focused
prototype features adaptive safety scaffolds, tailored interactions (e.g.,
step-by-step guidance for Neurodivergent users, simple wording for children),
and equitable conflict resolution. In preliminary evaluations, PVM outperforms
multi-agent baselines in compliance (76% vs. 70%), fairness (90% vs. 85%),
safety-violation rate (0% vs. 7%), and latency. Design innovations, including
video guidance, autonomy sliders, family hubs, and adaptive safety dashboards,
demonstrate new directions for ethical and inclusive domestic AI, for building
user-centered agentic systems in plural domestic contexts. Our Codes and Model
are been open sourced, available for reproduction:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决有语言障碍的老年人在使用AAC工具时难以进行有意义的社交沟通的问题，特别是当有效对话依赖个人记忆时。

Method: 开发SocializeChat系统，通过提取和重用用户个人记忆记录，结合话题偏好和人际关系亲密度，为不同社交情境生成定制化的句子建议。

Result: 用户研究表明，SocializeChat有潜力增强AAC支持的社交互动的包容性和相关性。

Conclusion: SocializeChat不仅利用过去经验支持互动，还将对话视为创造新记忆的机会，在记忆和沟通之间建立动态循环。

Abstract: Elderly people with speech impairments often face challenges in engaging in
meaningful social communication, particularly when using Augmentative and
Alternative Communication (AAC) tools that primarily address basic needs.
Moreover, effective chats often rely on personal memories, which is hard to
extract and reuse. We introduce SocializeChat, an AAC tool that generates
sentence suggestions by drawing on users' personal memory records. By
incorporating topic preference and interpersonal closeness, the system reuses
past experience and tailors suggestions to different social contexts and
conversation partners. SocializeChat not only leverages past experiences to
support interaction, but also treats conversations as opportunities to create
new memories, fostering a dynamic cycle between memory and communication. A
user study shows its potential to enhance the inclusivity and relevance of
AAC-supported social interaction.

*Jingruo Chen,TungYen Wang,Marie Williams,Natalia Jordan,Mingyi Shao,Linda Zhang,Susan R. Fussell*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究不同标签详细程度和内容重要性如何影响用户对AI生成图像的参与度和感知，发现详细标签提高透明度但不影响参与度，而内容重要性显著影响用户参与和信任。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成图像在社交媒体上日益普遍，引发了关于信任和真实性的担忧，需要研究如何通过标签策略来改善用户对这些内容的感知。

Method: 采用被试内实验设计，105名参与者评估不同标签详细程度（基础、中等、最大）和内容重要性（高vs低）对AI生成图像的影响。

Result: 增加标签详细程度提高了用户对标签透明度的感知，但不影响用户参与度；内容重要性显著影响用户参与和信任，用户在低重要性内容中表现出更高的参与度和信任。

Conclusion: 社交媒体平台可以采用详细标签来提高透明度而不损害用户参与度，这为AI生成内容的有效标签策略提供了见解。

Abstract: AI-generated images are increasingly prevalent on social media, raising
concerns about trust and authenticity. This study investigates how different
levels of label detail (basic, moderate, maximum) and content stakes (high vs.
low) influence user engagement with and perceptions of AI-generated images
through a within-subjects experimental study with 105 participants. Our
findings reveal that increasing label detail enhances user perceptions of label
transparency but does not affect user engagement. However, content stakes
significantly impact user engagement and perceptions, with users demonstrating
higher engagement and trust in low-stakes images. These results suggest that
social media platforms can adopt detailed labels to improve transparency
without compromising user engagement, offering insights for effective labeling
strategies for AI-generated content.

TL;DR: 该研究调查了AI产品中的用户界面包容性偏见，通过实地研究发现6种AI包容性缺陷类型，开发了改进的GenderMag-for-AI方法来检测这些缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI产品中用户界面层面的包容性偏见，这些偏见会不成比例地排除采用特定问题解决方法的用户，而现有研究对此关注不足。

Method: 与3个AI产品团队进行实地研究，使用现有的非AI导向包容性设计方法，调查AI产品中独特的包容性缺陷类型及其发现和修复方法。

Result: 识别出6种AI包容性缺陷类型，共出现83次，修复了47个缺陷实例，并开发了专门针对AI包容性缺陷检测的GenderMag-for-AI方法。

Conclusion: AI产品中存在独特的用户界面包容性偏见，改进的GenderMag-for-AI方法能有效检测特定类型的AI包容性缺陷，为开发者提供了发现和修复这些缺陷的工具。

Abstract: While much research has shown the presence of AI's "under-the-hood" biases
(e.g., algorithmic, training data, etc.), what about "over-the-hood"
inclusivity biases: barriers in user-facing AI products that disproportionately
exclude users with certain problem-solving approaches? Recent research has
begun to report the existence of such biases -- but what do they look like, how
prevalent are they, and how can developers find and fix them? To find out, we
conducted a field study with 3 AI product teams, to investigate what kinds of
AI inclusivity bugs exist uniquely in user-facing AI products, and whether/how
AI product teams might harness an existing (non-AI-oriented) inclusive design
method to find and fix them. The teams' work resulted in identifying 6 types of
AI inclusivity bugs arising 83 times, fixes covering 47 of these bug instances,
and a new variation of the GenderMag inclusive design method, GenderMag-for-AI,
that is especially effective at detecting certain kinds of AI inclusivity bugs.

TL;DR: 研究探讨人工智能在非物质文化遗产背景下作为助手时的人类-AI权力动态，通过中亚杜塔尔乐器表演案例，分析人类能动性与计算霸权之间的张力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI技术在非物质文化遗产中作为助手的角色日益突出，需要研究人类与AI之间的主权和纠缠关系，特别是关于能动性协商、文化抵抗和技术批判的问题。

Method: 研究者与艺术家合作开发了一个反馈工作流程，捕捉现场表演数据，进行数字转换，并通过沉浸式环境创建实时互动艺术体验。

Result: 实证数据显示，音乐家有选择地接受或拒绝算法建议以保护创作身份，揭示了人类与AI互动中的调节机制。

Conclusion: 去殖民化潜力需要重新设计工具或系统以支持文化生存，使技术不仅是反馈环境，更是挑战数字生态系统中计算霸权的去殖民实践场所。

Abstract: As emergent artificial intelligence technologies increasingly assert roles as
assistants within intangible cultural heritage contexts, researchers and
artists observe existing questions on the theme of agency negotiation, cultural
resistance, and technical critique. This research interrogates power dynamics
in human-AI sovereignty and entanglement for nomadic improvisational Dutar
performance, a living cultural heritage through a long-necked lute from the
Central Asia region. To investigate tensions between human agency and
computational hegemony, the researcher and artists examined and iterated a
feedback workflow that captures live performance data, processes digital
transformations, and creates a real-time interactive art experience via
immersive environments. Empirical data from artists and audience reveal
modulations where musicians selectively embrace or reject algorithmic
suggestions to preserve creative identity. The author concludes that decolonial
potential requires redesigning tools or systems for cultural survivance, where
technology becomes not merely a feedback environment but a site for decolonial
praxis, challenging computational hegemony in digital ecosystems.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: LLMartini是一个交互式系统，支持无缝比较、选择和直观的跨模型组合工具，通过分解响应为语义对齐的片段、自动合并共识内容并突出模型差异，显著提升了多LLM交互的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型多样性的增加，用户需要比较和组合不同模型的输出来获得更高质量或更全面的响应，但现有方法效率低下且认知负担高。

Method: 系统将响应分解为基于任务特定标准的语义对齐片段，自动合并共识内容，通过颜色编码突出模型差异，同时保留独特贡献。

Result: 用户研究(N=18)显示，LLMartini在所有测量指标上显著优于传统手动方法，包括任务完成时间、认知负荷和用户满意度。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了以人为中心的设计在增强多LLM交互效率和创造力方面的重要性，并为利用各种语言模型的互补优势提供了实际意义。

Abstract: The growing diversity of large language models (LLMs) means users often need
to compare and combine outputs from different models to obtain higher-quality
or more comprehensive responses. However, switching between separate interfaces
and manually integrating outputs is inherently inefficient, leading to a high
cognitive burden and fragmented workflows. To address this, we present
LLMartini, a novel interactive system that supports seamless comparison,
selection, and intuitive cross-model composition tools. The system decomposes
responses into semantically aligned segments based on task-specific criteria,
automatically merges consensus content, and highlights model differences
through color coding while preserving unique contributions. In a user study
(N=18), LLMartini significantly outperformed conventional manual methods across
all measured metrics, including task completion time, cognitive load, and user
satisfaction. Our work highlights the importance of human-centered design in
enhancing the efficiency and creativity of multi-LLM interactions and offers
practical implications for leveraging the complementary strengths of various
language models.

Motivation: 解决学习延迟系统在实际部署中面临的关键数据稀缺问题，使其能够适应不同专家并实现更实用和可扩展的人类-AI协作。

Method: 使用元学习从少量演示中生成专家特定嵌入，采用双重用途机制：首先生成大量伪标签用于训练，然后在测试时实现对新专家的即时适应。

Result: 在三个不同数据集上的实验结果表明，使用合成标签训练的模型能够快速接近oracle级别的性能，验证了该方法的数据效率。

Conclusion: 通过解决关键训练瓶颈，使自适应学习延迟系统更加实用和可扩展，为现实环境中的人类-AI协作铺平了道路。

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical data scarcity that hinders the practical
deployment of learning to defer (L2D) systems to the population. We introduce a
context-aware, semi-supervised framework that uses meta-learning to generate
expert-specific embeddings from only a few demonstrations. We demonstrate the
efficacy of a dual-purpose mechanism, where these embeddings are used first to
generate a large corpus of pseudo-labels for training, and subsequently to
enable on-the-fly adaptation to new experts at test-time. The experiment
results on three different datasets confirm that a model trained on these
synthetic labels rapidly approaches oracle-level performance, validating the
data efficiency of our approach. By resolving a key training bottleneck, this
work makes adaptive L2D systems more practical and scalable, paving the way for
human-AI collaboration in real-world environments. To facilitate
reproducibility and address implementation details not covered in the main
text, we provide our source code and training configurations at

Motivation: 随着AI系统日益自主，领域专家角色从执行任务转向监督AI输出。有效监督对防止AI错误至关重要，但目前缺乏对专家监督体验和动机需求的了解，需要设计支持有效监督的界面。

Method: 与心理学和计算机科学领域专家进行四次共同设计工作坊，包括监督AI评分系统、讨论监督体验和需求，以及协作原型设计界面。采用主题分析方法识别关键用户需求。

Result: 识别出四个关键用户需求：理解任务和责任、了解AI决策过程、对过程做出有意义贡献、与同事和AI协作。基于SMART工作设计模型开发了包含12个设计考虑因素的可推广框架。

Conclusion: 该框架将界面特征和用户需求与有效和满意工作的心理过程联系起来，为设计支持人类监督AI系统的有意义界面提供了具体指导，可跨领域应用并扩展现有人机交互指南。

Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly capable and autonomous, domain experts'
roles are shifting from performing tasks themselves to overseeing AI-generated
outputs. Such oversight is critical, as undetected errors can have serious
consequences or undermine the benefits of AI. Effective oversight, however,
depends not only on detecting and correcting AI errors but also on the
motivation and engagement of the oversight personnel and the meaningfulness
they see in their work. Yet little is known about how domain experts approach
and experience the oversight task and what should be considered to design
effective and motivational interfaces that support human oversight. To address
these questions, we conducted four co-design workshops with domain experts from
psychology and computer science. We asked them to first oversee an AI-based
grading system, and then discuss their experiences and needs during oversight.
Finally, they collaboratively prototyped interfaces that could support them in
their oversight task. Our thematic analysis revealed four key user
requirements: understanding tasks and responsibilities, gaining insight into
the AI's decision-making, contributing meaningfully to the process, and
collaborating with peers and the AI. We integrated these empirical insights
with the SMART model of work design to develop a generalizable framework of
twelve design considerations. Our framework links interface characteristics and
user requirements to the psychological processes underlying effective and
satisfying work. Being grounded in work design theory, we expect these
considerations to be applicable across domains and discuss how they extend
existing guidelines for human-AI interaction and theoretical frameworks for
effective human oversight by providing concrete guidance on the design of
engaging and meaningful interfaces that support human oversight of AI systems.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了在虚拟现实中使用数字孪生技术时，不同视角对无人机操控体验和性能的影响，发现第一人称视角带来更高认知负荷但控制更平滑，而第三人称视角最受用户青睐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机操控是认知要求很高的任务，事故常因情境意识不足、训练不够和用户体验差导致。通过数字孪生技术提供更直观的视觉反馈，可以提升飞行员意识和整体体验质量。

Method: 开发VR应用程序，让参与者在数字孪生环境中操控真实DJI Mini 4 Pro无人机，使用四种不同相机视角：基准视图（静态外部）、第一人称视角、追逐视角和第三人称视角。19名参与者完成基于圆环的障碍课程。

Result: 第一人称视角与显著更高的心理需求和努力、更大的轨迹偏差相关，但控制输入更平滑；第三人称视角和追逐视角表现更好。偏好数据显示第三人称视角最受青睐，而第一人称视角引发两极反应。

Conclusion: 不同虚拟视角对无人机操控体验和性能有显著影响，第三人称视角在用户偏好和性能表现上表现最佳，而第一人称视角虽然控制更平滑但认知负荷更高。

Abstract: Controlling Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is a cognitively demanding task,
with accidents often arising from insufficient situational awareness,
inadequate training, and poor user experiences. Providing more intuitive and
immersive visual feedback, particularly through Digital Twin technologies,
offers new opportunities to enhance pilot awareness and overall experience
quality. In this study, we investigate how different virtual points of view
(POVs) influence user experience and performance during UAV piloting in Virtual
Reality (VR), utilizing a digital twin that faithfully replicates the
real-world flight environment. We developed a VR application that enables
participants to control a physical DJI Mini 4 Pro drone while immersed in a
digital twin with four distinct camera perspectives: Baseline View (static
external), First-Person View, Chase View, and Third-Person View. Nineteen
participants completed a series of ring-based obstacle courses from each
perspective. In addition to objective flight data, we collected standardized
subjective assessments of user experience, presence, workload, cybersickness,
and situational awareness. Quantitative analyses revealed that the First-Person
View was associated with significantly higher mental demand and effort, greater
trajectory deviation, but smoother control inputs compared to the Third-Person
and Chase perspectives. Complementing these findings, preference data indicated
that the Third-Person View was most consistently favored, whereas the
First-Person View elicited polarized reactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然指令性反馈和元认知反馈都有理论优势，但它们在学生参与度、信心和工作质量方面的比较效果仍未充分探索。AI反馈的可扩展性和适应性为教育反馈提供了新可能。

Method: 在一门入门设计和编程课程中，对329名学生进行了为期一学期的随机对照试验，使用自适应教育平台，将参与者分配到接收指令性、元认知性或混合AI生成反馈的组别。

Result: 修订行为在不同反馈条件下存在差异，混合反馈组修订最多；信心评分普遍较高；各条件下的资源质量结果相似。

Conclusion: 混合反馈方法在提供即时改进的行动指导与自我反思机会之间取得了平衡，显示出将清晰度与反思相结合的潜力。

Abstract: Feedback is one of the most powerful influences on student learning, with
extensive research examining how best to implement it in educational settings.
Increasingly, feedback is being generated by artificial intelligence (AI),
offering scalable and adaptive responses. Two widely studied approaches are
directive feedback, which gives explicit explanations and reduces cognitive
load to speed up learning, and metacognitive feedback which prompts learners to
reflect, track their progress, and develop self-regulated learning (SRL)
skills. While both approaches have clear theoretical advantages, their
comparative effects on engagement, confidence, and quality of work remain
underexplored. This study presents a semester-long randomised controlled trial
with 329 students in an introductory design and programming course using an
adaptive educational platform. Participants were assigned to receive directive,
metacognitive, or hybrid AI-generated feedback that blended elements of both
directive and metacognitive feedback. Results showed that revision behaviour
differed across feedback conditions, with Hybrid prompting the most revisions
compared to Directive and Metacognitive. Confidence ratings were uniformly
high, and resource quality outcomes were comparable across conditions. These
findings highlight the promise of AI in delivering feedback that balances
clarity with reflection. Hybrid approaches, in particular, show potential to
combine actionable guidance for immediate improvement with opportunities for
self-reflection and metacognitive growth.

Abstract: Technological advancements have made video games a central part of the
digital lives of nearly 3 billion people worldwide. Although games can address
various social, physical, and psychological needs, their potential to support
human development and well-being remains underutilized. Research highlights
both negative effects, such as addiction and isolation, and positive outcomes
like cognitive improvements and problem-solving skills. However, public
discourse and regulation often focus more on risks than benefits. To address
this imbalance, we present LifeSync-Games, a framework leveraging simplified
digital twins to connect virtual gameplay with real-life activities. This
reciprocal relationship aims to enhance the developmental value of gaming by
promoting self-regulation and fostering growth across physical, mental, and
social domains. We present the framework's theoretical foundations,
technological components, design guidelines, and evaluation approaches.
Additionally, we present early applications in both new and bestselling games
to demonstrate its versatility and practical relevance.
