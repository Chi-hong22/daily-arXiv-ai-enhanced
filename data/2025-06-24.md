Abstract: Desktop cleaning demands open-vocabulary recognition and precise manipulation
for heterogeneous debris. We propose a hierarchical framework integrating
reflective Vision-Language Model (VLM) planning with dual-arm execution via
structured scene representation. Grounded-SAM2 facilitates open-vocabulary
detection, while a memory-augmented VLM generates, critiques, and revises
manipulation sequences. These sequences are converted into parametric
trajectories for five primitives executed by coordinated Franka arms. Evaluated
in simulated scenarios, our system achieving 87.2% task completion, a 28.8%
improvement over static VLM and 36.2% over single-arm baselines. Structured
memory integration proves crucial for robust, generalizable manipulation while
maintaining real-time control performance.

*Abhishek Phadke,Shakib Mahmud Dipto,Pratip Rana*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种生成合成LiDAR数据集的仿真工作流，用于支持自动驾驶感知、机器人研究和传感器安全分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为自动驾驶和机器人研究提供高质量合成数据，同时分析LiDAR数据的安全漏洞。

Method: 利用CoppeliaSim仿真环境和Python API，集成多种传感器（LiDAR、图像传感器、二维扫描仪）到模拟车辆平台，自动化数据捕获、存储和标注。

Abstract: This paper presents a simulation workflow for generating synthetic LiDAR
datasets to support autonomous vehicle perception, robotics research, and
sensor security analysis. Leveraging the CoppeliaSim simulation environment and
its Python API, we integrate time-of-flight LiDAR, image sensors, and two
dimensional scanners onto a simulated vehicle platform operating within an
urban scenario. The workflow automates data capture, storage, and annotation
across multiple formats (PCD, PLY, CSV), producing synchronized multimodal
datasets with ground truth pose information. We validate the pipeline by
generating large-scale point clouds and corresponding RGB and depth imagery.
The study examines potential security vulnerabilities in LiDAR data, such as
adversarial point injection and spoofing attacks, and demonstrates how
synthetic datasets can facilitate the evaluation of defense strategies.
Finally, limitations related to environmental realism, sensor noise modeling,
and computational scalability are discussed, and future research directions,
such as incorporating weather effects, real-world terrain models, and advanced
scanner configurations, are proposed. The workflow provides a versatile,
reproducible framework for generating high-fidelity synthetic LiDAR datasets to
advance perception research and strengthen sensor security in autonomous
systems. Documentation and examples accompany this framework; samples of
animated cloud returns and image sensor data can be found at this Link.

### [3] [Kinematic Model Optimization via Differentiable Contact Manifold for In-Space Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17458)
*Abhay Negi,Omey M. Manyar,Satyandra K. Gupta*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种仅需编码器测量和二进制接触检测的机器人运动学参数估计新方法，适用于太空环境中的精确操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 太空机器人操作（如碎片清除和太空制造）需要高精度接触操作，但热变形和编码器偏差导致运动学参数误差，传统校准方法不适用。

Method: 利用接触流形信息估计热变形应变和编码器偏差，包括可微分学习模型和基于优化的参数估计算法。

Result: 该方法仅需编码器数据和接触检测，实现了鲁棒、可解释且数据高效的参数估计。

Conclusion: 为太空环境下的安全精确操作提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Robotic manipulation in space is essential for emerging applications such as
debris removal and in-space servicing, assembly, and manufacturing (ISAM). A
key requirement for these tasks is the ability to perform precise, contact-rich
manipulation under significant uncertainty. In particular, thermal-induced
deformation of manipulator links and temperature-dependent encoder bias
introduce kinematic parameter errors that significantly degrade end-effector
accuracy. Traditional calibration techniques rely on external sensors or
dedicated calibration procedures, which can be infeasible or risky in dynamic,
space-based operational scenarios.
  This paper proposes a novel method for kinematic parameter estimation that
only requires encoder measurements and binary contact detection. The approach
focuses on estimating link thermal deformation strain and joint encoder biases
by leveraging information of the contact manifold - the set of relative SE(3)
poses at which contact between the manipulator and environment occurs. We
present two core contributions: (1) a differentiable, learning-based model of
the contact manifold, and (2) an optimization-based algorithm for estimating
kinematic parameters from encoder measurements at contact instances. By
enabling parameter estimation using only encoder measurements and contact
detection, this method provides a robust, interpretable, and data-efficient
solution for safe and accurate manipulation in the challenging conditions of
space.

### [4] [General-Purpose Robotic Navigation via LVLM-Orchestrated Perception, Reasoning, and Acting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17462)
*Bernard Lange,Anil Yildiz,Mansur Arief,Shehryar Khattak,Mykel Kochenderfer,Georgios Georgakis*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ARNA是一个基于LVLM的通用导航框架，通过自主定义任务流程实现未知环境中的导航和推理，无需预定义地图或固定输入表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有导航系统依赖特定任务神经网络和固定数据流，泛化能力有限，而LVLM提供了更接近人类的知识和推理能力。

Method: ARNA结合感知、推理和导航工具库，运行时自主定义任务流程，迭代查询机器人模块并选择导航动作。

Result: 在HM-EQA基准测试中，ARNA实现了最先进的性能，展示了有效的探索、导航和问答能力。

Conclusion: ARNA为机器人堆栈设计提供了新视角，支持未知环境中的鲁棒导航和推理。

Abstract: Developing general-purpose navigation policies for unknown environments
remains a core challenge in robotics. Most existing systems rely on
task-specific neural networks and fixed data flows, limiting generalizability.
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) offer a promising alternative by embedding
human-like knowledge suitable for reasoning and planning. Yet, prior LVLM-robot
integrations typically depend on pre-mapped spaces, hard-coded representations,
and myopic exploration. We introduce the Agentic Robotic Navigation
Architecture (ARNA), a general-purpose navigation framework that equips an
LVLM-based agent with a library of perception, reasoning, and navigation tools
available within modern robotic stacks. At runtime, the agent autonomously
defines and executes task-specific workflows that iteratively query the robotic
modules, reason over multimodal inputs, and select appropriate navigation
actions. This approach enables robust navigation and reasoning in previously
unmapped environments, providing a new perspective on robotic stack design.
Evaluated in Habitat Lab on the HM-EQA benchmark, ARNA achieves
state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating effective exploration, navigation,
and embodied question answering without relying on handcrafted plans, fixed
input representations, or pre-existing maps.

### [5] [DiLQR: Differentiable Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator via Implicit Differentiation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17473)
*Shuyuan Wang,Philip D. Loewen,Michael Forbes,Bhushan Gopaluni,Wei Pan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DiLQR框架通过隐式微分实现iLQR的可微性，显著提升计算效率和学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: iLQR作为可微分组件的潜力未被充分挖掘，现有方法在扩展性和效率上存在挑战。

Method: 提出DiLQR框架，通过隐式微分解析iLQR梯度，确保恒定反向计算成本。

Result: 在控制基准测试中，DiLQR计算速度提升21-128倍，学习性能提升百万倍。

Conclusion: DiLQR为高维端到端任务提供了高效可微控制器，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: While differentiable control has emerged as a powerful paradigm combining
model-free flexibility with model-based efficiency, the iterative Linear
Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) remains underexplored as a differentiable component.
The scalability of differentiating through extended iterations and horizons
poses significant challenges, hindering iLQR from being an effective
differentiable controller. This paper introduces DiLQR, a framework that
facilitates differentiation through iLQR, allowing it to serve as a trainable
and differentiable module, either as or within a neural network. A novel aspect
of this framework is the analytical solution that it provides for the gradient
of an iLQR controller through implicit differentiation, which ensures a
constant backward cost regardless of iteration, while producing an accurate
gradient. We evaluate our framework on imitation tasks on famous control
benchmarks. Our analytical method demonstrates superior computational
performance, achieving up to 128x speedup and a minimum of 21x speedup compared
to automatic differentiation. Our method also demonstrates superior learning
performance ($10^6$x) compared to traditional neural network policies and
better model loss with differentiable controllers that lack exact analytical
gradients. Furthermore, we integrate our module into a larger network with
visual inputs to demonstrate the capacity of our method for high-dimensional,
fully end-to-end tasks. Codes can be found on the project homepage

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RoboTwin 2.0是一个可扩展的仿真框架，用于生成多样化和真实的双臂操作数据，通过结合多模态大语言模型和领域随机化提升模拟到现实的迁移能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有合成数据集在双臂操作任务中表现不足，缺乏高效、可扩展的数据生成方法以及过于简化的仿真环境。

Method: 构建RoboTwin-OD对象库，结合MLLMs和仿真循环优化自动生成任务级执行代码，并通过五轴领域随机化增强数据多样性。

Result: 在50个双臂任务中生成10万条轨迹，代码生成成功率提升10.9%，VLA模型在未见场景中性能提升367%。

Conclusion: RoboTwin 2.0显著提升了双臂操作的鲁棒性和泛化能力，支持无真实世界监督的强泛化。

Abstract: Simulation-based data synthesis has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
enhancing real-world robotic manipulation. However, existing synthetic datasets
remain insufficient for robust bimanual manipulation due to two challenges: (1)
the lack of an efficient, scalable data generation method for novel tasks, and
(2) oversimplified simulation environments that fail to capture real-world
complexity. We present RoboTwin 2.0, a scalable simulation framework that
enables automated, large-scale generation of diverse and realistic data, along
with unified evaluation protocols for dual-arm manipulation. We first construct
RoboTwin-OD, a large-scale object library comprising 731 instances across 147
categories, each annotated with semantic and manipulation-relevant labels.
Building on this foundation, we develop an expert data synthesis pipeline that
combines multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with simulation-in-the-loop
refinement to generate task-level execution code automatically. To improve
sim-to-real transfer, RoboTwin 2.0 incorporates structured domain randomization
along five axes: clutter, lighting, background, tabletop height and language
instructions, thereby enhancing data diversity and policy robustness. We
instantiate this framework across 50 dual-arm tasks spanning five robot
embodiments, and pre-collect over 100,000 domain-randomized expert
trajectories. Empirical results show a 10.9% gain in code generation success
and improved generalization to novel real-world scenarios. A VLA model
fine-tuned on our dataset achieves a 367% relative improvement (42.0% vs. 9.0%)
on unseen scene real-world tasks, while zero-shot models trained solely on our
synthetic data achieve a 228% relative gain, highlighting strong generalization
without real-world supervision. We release the data generator, benchmark,
dataset, and code to support scalable research in robust bimanual manipulation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PRISM框架通过合成任务和环境数据，将大型语言模型（LLM）的能力蒸馏到小型语言模型（SLM）中，实现机器人规划器的本地化运行，性能接近GPT-4o的93%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前依赖云端LLM的机器人在通信不可靠的环境中（如户外或工业场景）受限，需要本地化解决方案。

Method: PRISM自动合成多样化任务和环境数据，利用LLM生成规划，并用这些数据蒸馏出紧凑的SLM作为替代。

Result: PRISM将Llama-3.2-3B的性能从GPT-4o的10-20%提升至93%以上，且适用于异构机器人平台和多样化环境。

Conclusion: PRISM为机器人提供了高效、本地化的规划能力，解决了云端依赖问题，并展示了良好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) provide robots with powerful contextual
reasoning abilities and a natural human interface. Yet, current LLM-enabled
robots typically depend on cloud-hosted models, limiting their usability in
environments with unreliable communication infrastructure, such as outdoor or
industrial settings. We present PRISM, a framework for distilling small
language model (SLM)-enabled robot planners that run on-device with minimal
human supervision. Starting from an existing LLM-enabled planner, PRISM
automatically synthesizes diverse tasks and environments, elicits plans from
the LLM, and uses this synthetic dataset to distill a compact SLM as a drop-in
replacement of the source model. We apply PRISM to three LLM-enabled planners
for mapping and exploration, manipulation, and household assistance, and we
demonstrate that PRISM improves the performance of Llama-3.2-3B from 10-20% of
GPT-4o's performance to over 93% - using only synthetic data. We further
demonstrate that the distilled planners generalize across heterogeneous robotic
platforms (ground and aerial) and diverse environments (indoor and outdoor). We
release all software, trained models, and datasets at

TL;DR: L1 KNODE-DW MPC框架通过自适应学习和精确动力学模型，解决了四旋翼无人机在紧密编队飞行中的气动干扰问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 紧密编队飞行中复杂的气动干扰难以建模和预测，导致无人机不稳定。

Method: 提出L1 KNODE-DW MPC框架，结合自适应学习和模型预测控制，适应时变气动干扰。

Result: 在两组三无人机编队中表现优于基线MPC，保持垂直对齐。

Conclusion: L1自适应模块与精确动力学模型结合，能有效补偿未建模干扰。

Abstract: The task of flying in tight formations is challenging for teams of quadrotors
because the complex aerodynamic wake interactions can destabilize individual
team members as well as the team. Furthermore, these aerodynamic effects are
highly nonlinear and fast-paced, making them difficult to model and predict. To
overcome these challenges, we present L1 KNODE-DW MPC, an adaptive, mixed
expert learning based control framework that allows individual quadrotors to
accurately track trajectories while adapting to time-varying aerodynamic
interactions during formation flights. We evaluate L1 KNODE-DW MPC in two
different three-quadrotor formations and show that it outperforms several MPC
baselines. Our results show that the proposed framework is capable of enabling
the three-quadrotor team to remain vertically aligned in close proximity
throughout the flight. These findings show that the L1 adaptive module
compensates for unmodeled disturbances most effectively when paired with an
accurate dynamics model. A video showcasing our framework and the physical
experiments is available here: https://youtu.be/9QX1Q5Ut9Rs

### [9] [EASE: Embodied Active Event Perception via Self-Supervised Energy Minimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17516)
*Zhou Chen,Sanjoy Kundu,Harsimran S. Baweja,Sathyanarayanan N. Aakur*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: EASE是一个自监督框架，通过自由能最小化统一时空表示学习和具身控制，无需标注或外部奖励，实现动态事件感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖预定义动作空间和标注数据，限制了在动态场景中的适应性和扩展性。

Method: 结合生成感知模型和动作驱动控制策略，利用预测误差和熵作为内在信号分割事件并跟踪关键目标。

Result: 在仿真和真实环境中验证了EASE的隐私保护和可扩展性，适用于动态任务。

Conclusion: EASE为无脚本动态任务中的具身系统提供了鲁棒基础。

Abstract: Active event perception, the ability to dynamically detect, track, and
summarize events in real time, is essential for embodied intelligence in tasks
such as human-AI collaboration, assistive robotics, and autonomous navigation.
However, existing approaches often depend on predefined action spaces,
annotated datasets, and extrinsic rewards, limiting their adaptability and
scalability in dynamic, real-world scenarios. Inspired by cognitive theories of
event perception and predictive coding, we propose EASE, a self-supervised
framework that unifies spatiotemporal representation learning and embodied
control through free energy minimization. EASE leverages prediction errors and
entropy as intrinsic signals to segment events, summarize observations, and
actively track salient actors, operating without explicit annotations or
external rewards. By coupling a generative perception model with an
action-driven control policy, EASE dynamically aligns predictions with
observations, enabling emergent behaviors such as implicit memory, target
continuity, and adaptability to novel environments. Extensive evaluations in
simulation and real-world settings demonstrate EASE's ability to achieve
privacy-preserving and scalable event perception, providing a robust foundation
for embodied systems in unscripted, dynamic tasks.

Motivation: 解决未来太空探索任务中机器人导航的安全性和可靠性问题，现有生成AI方法缺乏足够的安全保障。

Method: 融合快速学习的“系统1”和基于物理的“系统2”，在训练和推理中共享计算，结合适应性和形式化安全性。

Result: 在NASA JPL的Mars Yard实验中，失败率降低4倍，同时保持目标达成性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合学习与物理模型，显著提升导航安全性，无需额外训练即可利用推理计算。

Abstract: Safe, reliable navigation in extreme, unfamiliar terrain is required for
future robotic space exploration missions. Recent generative-AI methods learn
semantically aware navigation policies from large, cross-embodiment datasets,
but offer limited safety guarantees. Inspired by human cognitive science, we
propose a risk-guided diffusion framework that fuses a fast, learned "System-1"
with a slow, physics-based "System-2", sharing computation at both training and
inference to couple adaptability with formal safety. Hardware experiments
conducted at the NASA JPL's Mars-analog facility, Mars Yard, show that our
approach reduces failure rates by up to $4\times$ while matching the
goal-reaching performance of learning-based robotic models by leveraging
inference-time compute without any additional training.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合颈部运动的机器人模仿学习系统，通过动态视角数据集收集和新网络模型，显著提升了任务成功率和复杂场景适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统固定视角模仿学习限制了任务范围和表现力，而机器人颈部运动能扩展学习场景和动作多样性。

Method: 开发了包含颈部运动的数据集收集系统，并设计了新网络模型以学习包含颈部运动的操作任务。

Result: 模型在动态视角干扰下仍能保持约90%的成功率，尤其在传统模型难以处理的边缘或视野外物体场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了数据集收集效率，并将模仿学习扩展到更复杂和动态的场景中。

Abstract: Most prior research in deep imitation learning has predominantly utilized
fixed cameras for image input, which constrains task performance to the
predefined field of view. However, enabling a robot to actively maneuver its
neck can significantly expand the scope of imitation learning to encompass a
wider variety of tasks and expressive actions such as neck gestures. To
facilitate imitation learning in robots capable of neck movement while
simultaneously performing object manipulation, we propose a teaching system
that systematically collects datasets incorporating neck movements while
minimizing discomfort caused by dynamic viewpoints during teleoperation. In
addition, we present a novel network model for learning manipulation tasks
including active neck motion. Experimental results showed that our model can
achieve a high success rate of around 90\%, regardless of the distraction from
the viewpoint variations by active neck motion. Moreover, the proposed model
proved particularly effective in challenging scenarios, such as when objects
were situated at the periphery or beyond the standard field of view, where
traditional models struggled. The proposed approach contributes to the
efficiency of dataset collection and extends the applicability of imitation
learning to more complex and dynamic scenarios.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLA) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
and promising potential in solving complex robotic manipulation tasks. However,
their substantial parameter sizes and high inference latency pose significant
challenges for real-world deployment, particularly on resource-constrained
robotic platforms. To address this issue, we begin by conducting an extensive
empirical study to explore the effectiveness of model compression techniques
when applied to VLAs. Building on the insights gained from these preliminary
experiments, we propose RLRC, a three-stage recovery method for compressed
VLAs, including structured pruning, performance recovery based on SFT and RL,
and further quantization. RLRC achieves up to an 8x reduction in memory usage
and a 2.3x improvement in inference throughput, while maintaining or even
surpassing the original VLA's task success rate. Extensive experiments show
that RLRC consistently outperforms existing compression baselines,
demonstrating strong potential for on-device deployment of VLAs. Project

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SLAM系统中因轨迹导致的地图估计不准确问题，并改进探索规划和停止条件。

Method: 使用概率分布建模地图不确定性，定义Uncertainty Frontiers（UF）作为目标，引入SiREn衡量覆盖与不确定性。

Result: 方法兼容多种传感器，能自主探索开放空间，解决了探索规划和停止条件问题。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在主动SLAM中有效，代码和数据公开，便于推广和验证。

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of the environment is a central goal of Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems. However, the agent's trajectory can
significantly affect estimation accuracy. This paper presents a new method to
model map uncertainty in Active SLAM systems using an Uncertainty Map (UM). The
UM uses probability distributions to capture where the map is uncertain,
allowing Uncertainty Frontiers (UF) to be defined as key
exploration-exploitation objectives and potential stopping criteria. In
addition, the method introduces the Signed Relative Entropy (SiREn), based on
the Kullback-Leibler divergence, to measure both coverage and uncertainty
together. This helps balance exploration and exploitation through an
easy-to-understand parameter. Unlike methods that depend on particular SLAM
setups, the proposed approach is compatible with different types of sensors,
such as cameras, LiDARs, and multi-sensor fusion. It also addresses common
problems in exploration planning and stopping conditions. Furthermore,
integrating this map modeling approach with a UF-based planning system enables
the agent to autonomously explore open spaces, a behavior not previously
observed in the Active SLAM literature. Code and implementation details are
available as a ROS node, and all generated data are openly available for public
use, facilitating broader adoption and validation of the proposed approach.

Result: 实验表明，RoboMonkey显著提升性能，OOD任务提升25%，ID任务提升8%，新机器人适配性能提升7%。

Conclusion: RoboMonkey通过测试时扩展和验证机制有效增强了VLA模型的鲁棒性和适应性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in visuomotor control, yet ensuring their robustness in unstructured real-world
environments remains a persistent challenge. In this paper, we investigate
test-time scaling through the lens of sampling and verification as means to
enhance the robustness and generalization of VLAs. We first demonstrate that
the relationship between action error and the number of generated samples
follows an exponentiated power law across a range of VLAs, indicating the
existence of inference-time scaling laws. Building on these insights, we
introduce RoboMonkey, a test-time scaling framework for VLAs. At deployment,
RoboMonkey samples a small set of actions from a VLA, applies Gaussian
perturbation and majority voting to construct an action proposal distribution,
and then uses a Vision Language Model (VLM)-based verifier to select the
optimal action. We propose a synthetic data generation pipeline for training
such VLM-based action verifiers, and demonstrate that scaling the synthetic
dataset consistently improves verification and downstream accuracy. Through
extensive simulated and hardware experiments, we show that pairing existing
VLAs with RoboMonkey yields significant performance gains, achieving a 25%
absolute improvement on out-of-distribution tasks and 8% on in-distribution
tasks. Additionally, when adapting to new robot setups, we show that
fine-tuning both VLAs and action verifiers yields a 7% performance increase
compared to fine-tuning VLAs alone.

Abstract: Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) docking in dynamic and uncertain
environments is a critical challenge for underwater robotics. Reinforcement
learning is a promising method for developing robust controllers, but the
disparity between training simulations and the real world, or the sim2real gap,
often leads to a significant deterioration in performance. In this work, we
perform a simulation study on reducing the sim2real gap in autonomous docking
through training various controllers and then evaluating them under realistic
disturbances. In particular, we focus on the real-world challenge of docking
under different payloads that are potentially outside the original training
distribution. We explore existing methods for improving robustness including
randomization techniques and history-conditioned controllers. Our findings
provide insights into mitigating the sim2real gap when training docking
controllers. Furthermore, our work indicates areas of future research that may
be beneficial to the marine robotics community.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了具身化（SAR）与非具身化（聊天机器人）对心理治疗中参与者披露行为的影响，发现具身化随时间推移能显著提升参与度和亲密感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球心理健康危机促使研究者开发可及性治疗技术，但技术效果的长期影响尚不明确。

Method: 采用因子设计，评估具身化和时间对参与者披露行为的影响，26名大学生在两周内使用SAR或聊天机器人完成每日CBT练习。

Result: 具身化条件下，参与度和亲密感随时间显著提升；非具身化条件下则下降。

Conclusion: 具身化设计对长期治疗效果有积极影响，值得进一步研究。

Abstract: Many researchers are working to address the worldwide mental health crisis by
developing therapeutic technologies that increase the accessibility of care,
including leveraging large language model (LLM) capabilities in chatbots and
socially assistive robots (SARs) used for therapeutic applications. Yet, the
effects of these technologies over time remain unexplored. In this study, we
use a factorial design to assess the impact of embodiment and time spent
engaging in therapeutic exercises on participant disclosures. We assessed
transcripts gathered from a two-week study in which 26 university student
participants completed daily interactive Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
exercises in their residences using either an LLM-powered SAR or a disembodied
chatbot. We evaluated the levels of active engagement and high intimacy of
their disclosures (opinions, judgments, and emotions) during each session and
over time. Our findings show significant interactions between time and
embodiment for both outcome measures: participant engagement and intimacy
increased over time in the physical robot condition, while both measures
decreased in the chatbot condition.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了基于学习的控制方法（如强化学习）与传统几何控制器（GC）在四旋翼飞行器轨迹跟踪任务中的性能比较，提出了公平比较的最佳实践，并纠正了先前研究中偏向RL的偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于揭示和解决在比较不同类别控制器（如RL和GC）时存在的潜在偏差，确保公平的性能评估。

Method: 通过案例研究（四旋翼飞行器的敏捷轨迹跟踪任务），开发了一套最佳实践，用于合成和比较RL与GC控制器，并纠正了任务定义、数据集和前馈信息的不对称性。

Result: 研究发现，在对称比较条件下，RL与GC的性能差距比先前研究报道的小；GC在稳态误差上表现更好，而RL在瞬态性能上更优。

Conclusion: 结论强调了公平比较的重要性，并开源了控制器实现代码，以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Learning-based control approaches like reinforcement learning (RL) have
recently produced a slew of impressive results for tasks like quadrotor
trajectory tracking and drone racing. Naturally, it is common to demonstrate
the advantages of these new controllers against established methods like
analytical controllers. We observe, however, that reliably comparing the
performance of such very different classes of controllers is more complicated
than might appear at first sight. As a case study, we take up the problem of
agile tracking of an end-effector for a quadrotor with a fixed arm. We develop
a set of best practices for synthesizing the best-in-class RL and geometric
controllers (GC) for benchmarking. In the process, we resolve widespread
RL-favoring biases in prior studies that provide asymmetric access to: (1) the
task definition, in the form of an objective function, (2) representative
datasets, for parameter optimization, and (3) feedforward information,
describing the desired future trajectory. The resulting findings are the
following: our improvements to the experimental protocol for comparing learned
and classical controllers are critical, and each of the above asymmetries can
yield misleading conclusions. Prior works have claimed that RL outperforms GC,
but we find the gaps between the two controller classes are much smaller than
previously published when accounting for symmetric comparisons. Geometric
control achieves lower steady-state error than RL, while RL has better
transient performance, resulting in GC performing better in relatively slow or
less agile tasks, but RL performing better when greater agility is required.
Finally, we open-source implementations of geometric and RL controllers for
these aerial vehicles, implementing best practices for future development.

Conclusion: 该方法提高了协作机器人抓取算法的透明度和可靠性，适用于工业环境。

Abstract: Neural networks are often regarded as universal equations that can estimate
any function. This flexibility, however, comes with the drawback of high
complexity, rendering these networks into black box models, which is especially
relevant in safety-centric applications. To that end, we propose a pipeline for
a collaborative robot (Cobot) grasping algorithm that detects relevant tools
and generates the optimal grasp. To increase the transparency and reliability
of this approach, we integrate an explainable AI method that provides an
explanation for the underlying prediction of a model by extracting the learned
features and correlating them to corresponding classes from the input. These
concepts are then used as additional criteria to ensure the safe handling of
work tools. In this paper, we show the consistency of this approach and the
criterion for improving the handover position. This approach was tested in an
industrial environment, where a camera system was set up to enable a robot to
pick up certain tools and objects.

Motivation: 复杂动力系统的建模和预测在流体动力学和机器人学等领域至关重要，但几何约束和能量传递的复杂性带来了显著挑战。

Method: GFC利用黎曼和接触几何作为归纳偏置，构建了一个潜在接触哈密顿模型，并通过接触同胚的集合调整模型以适应目标动力学。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在物理系统动力学学习和机器人交互任务控制中表现出色。

Conclusion: GFC框架通过几何约束和不确定性感知的测地线，实现了对未见场景的鲁棒泛化和适应。

Abstract: Accurately modeling and predicting complex dynamical systems, particularly
those involving force exchange and dissipation, is crucial for applications
ranging from fluid dynamics to robotics, but presents significant challenges
due to the intricate interplay of geometric constraints and energy transfer.
This paper introduces Geometric Contact Flows (GFC), a novel framework
leveraging Riemannian and Contact geometry as inductive biases to learn such
systems. GCF constructs a latent contact Hamiltonian model encoding desirable
properties like stability or energy conservation. An ensemble of
contactomorphisms then adapts this model to the target dynamics while
preserving these properties. This ensemble allows for uncertainty-aware
geodesics that attract the system's behavior toward the data support, enabling
robust generalization and adaptation to unseen scenarios. Experiments on
learning dynamics for physical systems and for controlling robots on
interaction tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: 该传感器设计为增强手术机器人术中感知和控制提供了有前景的解决方案，适用于多种连续体机器人架构。

Abstract: Continuum robots have been widely adopted in robot-assisted minimally
invasive surgery (RMIS) because of their compact size and high flexibility.
However, their proprioceptive capabilities remain limited, particularly in
narrow lumens, where lack of environmental awareness can lead to unintended
tissue contact and surgical risks. To address this challenge, this work
proposes a flexible annular sensor structure integrated around the vertebral
disks of continuum robots. The proposed design enables real-time environmental
mapping by estimating the distance between the robotic disks and the
surrounding tissue, thereby facilitating safer operation through advanced
control strategies. The experiment has proven that its accuracy in obstacle
detection can reach 0.19 mm. Fabricated using flexible printed circuit (FPC)
technology, the sensor demonstrates a modular and cost-effective design with
compact dimensions and low noise interference. Its adaptable parameters allow
compatibility with various continuum robot architectures, offering a promising
solution for enhancing intraoperative perception and control in surgical
robotics.

Method: 结合神经网络回归与牛顿-欧拉和欧拉-拉格朗日运动方程，构建物理信息模型，并在MABI MAX 100工业机器人数据上进行比较。

Result: 当估计电机扭矩时，拉格朗日网络因未显式建模耗散扭矩而表现较差，牛顿网络更优。

Conclusion: 在特定条件下，牛顿神经网络更适合工业机器人逆动力学建模。

Abstract: Accurate inverse dynamics models are essential tools for controlling
industrial robots. Recent research combines neural network regression with
inverse dynamics formulations of the Newton-Euler and the Euler-Lagrange
equations of motion, resulting in so-called Newtonian neural networks and
Lagrangian neural networks, respectively. These physics-informed models seek to
identify unknowns in the analytical equations from data. Despite their
potential, current literature lacks guidance on choosing between Lagrangian and
Newtonian networks. In this study, we show that when motor torques are
estimated instead of directly measuring joint torques, Lagrangian networks
prove less effective compared to Newtonian networks as they do not explicitly
model dissipative torques. The performance of these models is compared to
neural network regression on data of a MABI MAX 100 industrial robot.

Motivation: 现有LiDAR SLAM方法在动态物体干扰、点云噪声和非结构化环境中需在定位精度和系统鲁棒性之间权衡，亟需一种兼顾两者的解决方案。

Method: 设计了动态分割头预测动态特征点类别以消除动态点；全局重要性评分头自适应选择高贡献特征点并抑制噪声；构建GLI-GCN模块融合多尺度邻域结构增强特征判别能力。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上测试，取得了优异的结果。

Conclusion: ADA-DPM策略在定位精度和系统鲁棒性方面均表现出色，有效解决了动态干扰和噪声问题。

Abstract: LiDAR SLAM has demonstrated significant application value in various fields,
including mobile robot navigation and high-precision map construction. However,
existing methods often need to make a trade-off between positioning accuracy
and system robustness when faced with dynamic object interference, point cloud
noise, and unstructured environments. To address this challenge, we propose an
adaptive noise filtering SLAM strategy-ADA-DPM, achieving excellent preference
in both aspects. We design the Dynamic Segmentation Head to predict the
category of feature points belonging to dynamic points, to eliminate dynamic
feature points; design the Global Importance Scoring Head to adaptively select
feature points with higher contribution and features while suppressing noise
interference; and construct the Cross Layer Intra-Graph Convolution Module
(GLI-GCN) to fuse multi-scale neighborhood structures, thereby enhancing the
discriminative ability of overlapping features. Finally, to further validate
the effectiveness of our method, we tested it on several publicly available
datasets and achieved outstanding results.

Motivation: 尽管学习-教学（LbT）范式受到关注，但缺乏对自主社交机器人在真实课堂中应用的研究，现有方法多为脚本化或Wizard-of-Oz设计，限制了实时互动学习的理解。

Method: 采用交互式RL作为认知模型，进行两项实验，58名小学生分别通过教学机器人或平板自主学习法语词汇和语法。机器人通过学生的反馈学习。

Result: LbT组学生在语法任务中的记忆保持显著优于自学组，尤其是基础知识较弱的学生。行为数据显示学生调整教学策略并更深入参与推理任务。

Conclusion: 研究提出交互式RL作为可扩展的同伴机器人学习模型，并首次展示多自主机器人在真实课堂中的可行性，表明机器人可作为适应性伙伴提升学习效果。

Abstract: Despite growing interest in Learning-by-Teaching (LbT), few studies have
explored how this paradigm can be implemented with autonomous, peer-like social
robots in real classrooms. Most prior work has relied on scripted or
Wizard-of-Oz behaviors, limiting our understanding of how real-time,
interactive learning can be supported by artificial agents. This study
addresses this gap by introducing Interactive Reinforcement Learning (RL) as a
cognitive model for teachable social robots. We conducted two between-subject
experiments with 58 primary school children, who either taught a robot or
practiced independently on a tablet while learning French vocabulary
(memorization) and grammatical rules (inference). The robot, powered by
Interactive RL, learned from the child's evaluative feedback. Children in the
LbT condition achieved significantly higher retention gains compared to those
in the self-practice condition, especially on the grammar task. Learners with
lower prior knowledge benefited most from teaching the robot. Behavioural
metrics revealed that children adapted their teaching strategies over time and
engaged more deeply during inference tasks. This work makes two contributions:
(1) it introduces Interactive RL as a pedagogically effective and scalable
model for peer-robot learning, and (2) it demonstrates, for the first time, the
feasibility of deploying multiple autonomous robots simultaneously in real
classrooms. These findings extend theoretical understanding of LbT by showing
that social robots can function not only as passive tutees but as adaptive
partners that enhance meta-cognitive engagement and long-term learning
outcomes.

Conclusion: 深入理解和评估复杂形态的皮肤和标记触觉传感器原理对获取准确几何信息至关重要。

Abstract: Vision-Based Tactile Sensors (VBTSs) stand out for their superior performance
due to their high-information content output. Recently, marker-based VBTSs have
been shown to give accurate geometry reconstruction when using stereo cameras.
\uhl{However, many marker-based VBTSs use complex biomimetic skin-marker
arrangements, which presents issues for the geometric reconstruction of the
skin surface from the markers}. Here we investigate how the marker-based skin
morphology affects stereo vision-based tactile sensing, using a novel VBTS
called the StereoTacTip. To achieve accurate geometry reconstruction, we
introduce: (i) stereo marker matching and tracking using a novel
Delaunay-Triangulation-Ring-Coding algorithm; (ii) a refractive depth
correction model that corrects the depth distortion caused by refraction in the
internal media; (iii) a skin surface correction model from the marker
positions, relying on an inverse calculation of normals to the skin surface;
and (iv)~methods for geometry reconstruction over multiple contacts. To
demonstrate these findings, we reconstruct topographic terrains on a large 3D
map. Even though contributions (i) and (ii) were developed for biomimetic
markers, they should improve the performance of all marker-based VBTSs.
Overall, this work illustrates that a thorough understanding and evaluation of
the morphologically-complex skin and marker-based tactile sensor principles are
crucial for obtaining accurate geometric information.

Abstract: The gaze of a person tends to reflect their interest. This work explores what
happens when this statement is taken literally and applied to robots. Here we
present a robot system that employs a moving robot head with a screen-based eye
model that can direct the robot's gaze to points in physical space and present
a reflection-like mirror image of the attended region on top of each eye. We
conducted a user study with 33 participants, who were asked to instruct the
robot to perform pick-and-place tasks, monitor the robot's task execution, and
interrupt it in case of erroneous actions. Despite a deliberate lack of
instructions about the role of the eyes and a very brief system exposure,
participants felt more aware about the robot's information processing, detected
erroneous actions earlier, and rated the user experience higher when eye-based
mirroring was enabled compared to non-reflective eyes. These results suggest a
beneficial and intuitive utilization of the introduced method in cooperative
human-robot interaction.

Abstract: Comprehensive, unbiased, and comparable evaluation of modern generalist
policies is uniquely challenging: existing approaches for robot benchmarking
typically rely on heavy standardization, either by specifying fixed evaluation
tasks and environments, or by hosting centralized ''robot challenges'', and do
not readily scale to evaluating generalist policies across a broad range of
tasks and environments. In this work, we propose RoboArena, a new approach for
scalable evaluation of generalist robot policies in the real world. Instead of
standardizing evaluations around fixed tasks, environments, or locations, we
propose to crowd-source evaluations across a distributed network of evaluators.
Importantly, evaluators can freely choose the tasks and environments they
evaluate on, enabling easy scaling of diversity, but they are required to
perform double-blind evaluations over pairs of policies. Then, by aggregating
preference feedback from pairwise comparisons across diverse tasks and
environments, we can derive a ranking of policies. We instantiate our approach
across a network of evaluators at seven academic institutions using the DROID
robot platform. Through more than 600 pairwise real-robot evaluation episodes
across seven generalist policies, we demonstrate that our crowd-sourced
approach can more accurately rank the performance of existing generalist
policies than conventional, centralized evaluation approaches, while being more
scalable, resilient, and trustworthy. We open our evaluation network to the
community and hope that it can enable more accessible comparisons of generalist
robot policies.

Abstract: The automation of composite sheet layup is essential to meet the increasing
demand for composite materials in various industries. However, draping plans
for the robotic layup of composite sheets are not robust. A plan that works
well under a certain condition does not work well in a different condition.
Changes in operating conditions due to either changes in material properties or
working environment may lead a draping plan to exhibit suboptimal performance.
In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework aimed at refining plans
based on the observed execution performance. Our framework prioritizes the
minimization of uncompacted regions while simultaneously improving time
efficiency. To achieve this, we integrate human expertise with data-driven
decision-making to refine expert-crafted plans for diverse production
environments. We conduct experiments to validate the effectiveness of our
approach, revealing significant reductions in the number of corrective paths
required compared to initial expert-crafted plans. Through a combination of
empirical data analysis, action-effectiveness modeling, and search-based
refinement, our system achieves superior time efficiency in robotic layup.
Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in optimizing the
layup process, thereby advancing the state-of-the-art in composite
manufacturing automation.

Abstract: Multi-robot systems are emerging as a promising solution to the growing
demand for productivity, safety, and adaptability across industrial sectors.
However, effectively coordinating multiple robots in dynamic and uncertain
environments, such as construction sites, remains a challenge, particularly due
to unpredictable factors like material delays, unexpected site conditions, and
weather-induced disruptions. To address these challenges, this study proposes
an adaptive task allocation framework that strategically leverages the
synergistic potential of Digital Twins, Integer Programming (IP), and Large
Language Models (LLMs). The multi-robot task allocation problem is formally
defined and solved using an IP model that accounts for task dependencies, robot
heterogeneity, scheduling constraints, and re-planning requirements. A
mechanism for narrative-driven schedule adaptation is introduced, in which
unstructured natural language inputs are interpreted by an LLM, and
optimization constraints are autonomously updated, enabling human-in-the-loop
flexibility without manual coding. A digital twin-based system has been
developed to enable real-time synchronization between physical operations and
their digital representations. This closed-loop feedback framework ensures that
the system remains dynamic and responsive to ongoing changes on site. A case
study demonstrates both the computational efficiency of the optimization
algorithm and the reasoning performance of several LLMs, with top-performing
models achieving over 97% accuracy in constraint and parameter extraction. The
results confirm the practicality, adaptability, and cross-domain applicability
of the proposed methods.

and adaptive correction. Additionally, we introduce a 3D-printed TPU soft
gripper to facilitate delicate manipulations. Experimental results demonstrate
that Haptic-ACT improves the task success rate, robustness, and adaptability
compared to conventional ACT, particularly in dynamic environments. These
findings highlight the potential of multimodal learning in robotics for

Abstract: With the development of robot electronic skin technology, various tactile
sensors, enhanced by AI, are unlocking a new dimension of perception for
robots. In this work, we explore how robots equipped with electronic skin can
recognize tactile gestures and interpret them as human commands. We developed a
modular robot E-skin, composed of multiple irregularly shaped skin patches,
which can be assembled to cover the robot's body while capturing real-time
pressure and pose data from thousands of sensing points. To process this
information, we propose an equivariant graph neural network-based recognizer
that efficiently and accurately classifies diverse tactile gestures, including
poke, grab, stroke, and double-pat. By mapping the recognized gestures to
predefined robot actions, we enable intuitive human-robot interaction purely
through tactile input.

Abstract: Autonomous tracking of flying aerial objects has important civilian and
defense applications, ranging from search and rescue to counter-unmanned aerial
systems (counter-UAS). Ground based tracking requires setting up
infrastructure, could be range limited, and may not be feasible in remote
areas, crowded cities or in dense vegetation areas. Vision based active
tracking of aerial objects from another airborne vehicle, e.g., a chaser
unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), promises to fill this important gap, along with
serving aerial coordination use cases. Vision-based active tracking by a UAV
entails solving two coupled problems: 1) compute-efficient and accurate
(target) object detection and target state estimation; and 2) maneuver
decisions to ensure that the target remains in the field of view in the future
time-steps and favorably positioned for continued detection. As a solution to
the first problem, this paper presents a novel integration of standard deep
learning based architectures with Kernelized Correlation Filter (KCF) to
achieve compute-efficient object detection without compromising accuracy,
unlike standalone learning or filtering approaches. The proposed perception
framework is validated using a lab-scale setup. For the second problem, to
obviate the linearity assumptions and background variations limiting
effectiveness of the traditional controllers, we present the use of
reinforcement learning to train a neuro-controller for fast computation of
velocity maneuvers. New state space, action space and reward formulations are
developed for this purpose, and training is performed in simulation using
AirSim. The trained model is also tested in AirSim with respect to complex
target maneuvers, and is found to outperform a baseline PID control in terms of
tracking up-time and average distance maintained (from the target) during
tracking.

Result: 在真实场景数据中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为LiDAR-相机标定提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Precise sensor calibration is critical for autonomous vehicles as a
prerequisite for perception algorithms to function properly. Rotation error of
one degree can translate to position error of meters in target object detection
at large distance, leading to improper reaction of the system or even safety
related issues. Many methods for multi-sensor calibration have been proposed.
However, there are very few work that comprehensively consider the challenges
of the calibration procedure when applied to factory manufacturing pipeline or
after-sales service scenarios. In this work, we introduce a fully automatic
LiDAR-camera extrinsic calibration algorithm based on targets that is fast,
easy to deploy and robust to sensor noises such as missing data. The core of
the method include: (1) an automatic multi-stage LiDAR board detection pipeline
using only geometry information with no specific material requirement; (2) a
fast coarse extrinsic parameter search mechanism that is robust to initial
extrinsic errors; (3) a direct optimization algorithm that is robust to sensor
noises. We validate the effectiveness of our methods through experiments on
data captured in real world scenarios.

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of using a robot arm to manipulate a uniformly
rotating chain with its bottom end fixed. Existing studies have investigated
ideal rotational shapes for practical applications, yet they do not discuss how
these shapes can be consistently achieved through manipulation planning. Our
work presents a manipulation strategy for stable and consistent shape
transitions. We find that the configuration space of such a chain is
homeomorphic to a three-dimensional cube. Using this property, we suggest a
strategy to manipulate the chain into different configurations, specifically
from one rotation mode to another, while taking stability and feasibility into
consideration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy in physical
experiments by successfully transitioning from rest to the first two rotation
modes. The concepts explored in our work has critical applications in ensuring
safety and efficiency of drill string and yarn spinning operations.

Abstract: Precise and flexible cart-pushing is a challenging task for mobile robots.
The motion constraints during cart-pushing and the robot's redundancy lead to
complex motion planning problems, while variable payloads and disturbances
present complicated dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel planning and
control framework for flexible whole-body coordination and robust adaptive
control. Our motion planning method employs a local coordinate representation
and a novel kinematic model to solve a nonlinear optimization problem, thereby
enhancing motion maneuverability by generating feasible and flexible push
poses. Furthermore, we present a disturbance rejection control method to resist
disturbances and reduce control errors for the complex control problem without
requiring an accurate dynamic model. We validate our method through extensive
experiments in simulation and real-world settings, demonstrating its
superiority over existing approaches. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work to systematically evaluate the flexibility and robustness of
cart-pushing methods in experiments. The video supplement is available at

Conclusion: 该框架在挑战性环境中能实现可靠且高效的自我运动速度估计。

Abstract: Achieving reliable ego motion estimation for agile robots, e.g., aerobatic
aircraft, remains challenging because most robot sensors fail to respond timely
and clearly to highly dynamic robot motions, often resulting in measurement
blurring, distortion, and delays. In this paper, we propose an IMU-free and
feature-association-free framework to achieve aggressive ego-motion velocity
estimation of a robot platform in highly dynamic scenarios by combining two
types of exteroceptive sensors, an event camera and a millimeter wave radar,
First, we used instantaneous raw events and Doppler measurements to derive
rotational and translational velocities directly. Without a sophisticated
association process between measurement frames, the proposed method is more
robust in texture-less and structureless environments and is more
computationally efficient for edge computing devices. Then, in the back-end, we
propose a continuous-time state-space model to fuse the hybrid time-based and
event-based measurements to estimate the ego-motion velocity in a fixed-lagged
smoother fashion. In the end, we validate our velometer framework extensively
in self-collected experiment datasets. The results indicate that our IMU-free
and association-free ego motion estimation framework can achieve reliable and
efficient velocity output in challenging environments. The source code,
illustrative video and dataset are available at

Conclusion: GraspMAS通过多智能体协作解决了语言驱动抓取检测的关键挑战，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Language-driven grasp detection has the potential to revolutionize
human-robot interaction by allowing robots to understand and execute grasping
tasks based on natural language commands. However, existing approaches face two
key challenges. First, they often struggle to interpret complex text
instructions or operate ineffectively in densely cluttered environments.
Second, most methods require a training or finetuning step to adapt to new
domains, limiting their generation in real-world applications. In this paper,
we introduce GraspMAS, a new multi-agent system framework for language-driven
grasp detection. GraspMAS is designed to reason through ambiguities and improve
decision-making in real-world scenarios. Our framework consists of three
specialized agents: Planner, responsible for strategizing complex queries;
Coder, which generates and executes source code; and Observer, which evaluates
the outcomes and provides feedback. Intensive experiments on two large-scale
datasets demonstrate that our GraspMAS significantly outperforms existing
baselines. Additionally, robot experiments conducted in both simulation and
real-world settings further validate the effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: H-GRAIL为开放学习中的多挑战提供了集成解决方案。

Abstract: Developing agents capable of autonomously interacting with complex and
dynamic environments, where task structures may change over time and prior
knowledge cannot be relied upon, is a key prerequisite for deploying artificial
systems in real-world settings. The open-ended learning framework identifies
the core challenges for creating such agents, including the ability to
autonomously generate new goals, acquire the necessary skills (or curricula of
skills) to achieve them, and adapt to non-stationary environments. While many
existing works tackles various aspects of these challenges in isolation, few
propose integrated solutions that address them simultaneously. In this paper,
we introduce H-GRAIL, a hierarchical architecture that, through the use of
different typologies of intrinsic motivations and interconnected learning
mechanisms, autonomously discovers new goals, learns the required skills for
their achievement, generates skill sequences for tackling interdependent tasks,
and adapts to non-stationary environments. We tested H-GRAIL in a real robotic
scenario, demonstrating how the proposed solutions effectively address the
various challenges of open-ended learning.

Conclusion: 该实验装置为CDPRs的复杂动力学建模和控制算法验证提供了有效平台，未来将用于更高级的运动规划算法验证。

Abstract: In cable driven parallel robots (CDPRs), the payload is suspended using a
network of cables whose length can be controlled to maneuver the payload within
the workspace. Compared to rigid link robots, CDPRs provide better
maneuverability due to the flexibility of the cables and consume lesser power
due to the high strength-to-weight ratio of the cables. However, amongst other
things, the flexibility of the cables and the fact that they can only pull (and
not push) render the dynamics of CDPRs complex. Hence advanced modelling
paradigms and control algorithms must be developed to fully utilize the
potential of CDPRs. Furthermore, given the complex dynamics of CDPRs, the
models and control algorithms proposed for them must be validated on
experimental setups to ascertain their efficacy in practice. We have recently
developed an elaborate experimental setup for a CDPR with three cables and
validated elementary open-loop motion planning algorithms on it. In this paper,
we describe several aspects of the design and fabrication of our setup,
including component selection and assembly, and present our experimental
results. Our setup can reproduce complex phenomenon such as the transverse
vibration of the cables seen in large CDPRs and will in the future be used to
model and control such phenomenon and also to validate more sophisticated
motion planning algorithms.

Abstract: Using 3D point clouds in odometry estimation in robotics often requires
finding a set of correspondences between points in subsequent scans. While
there are established methods for point clouds of sufficient quality,
state-of-the-art still struggles when this quality drops. Thus, this paper
presents a novel learning-based framework for predicting robust point
correspondences between pairs of noisy, sparse and unstructured 3D point clouds
from a light-weight, low-power, inexpensive, consumer-grade System-on-Chip
(SoC) Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar sensor. Our network is
based on the transformer architecture which allows leveraging the attention
mechanism to discover pairs of points in consecutive scans with the greatest
mutual affinity. The proposed network is trained in a self-supervised way using
set-based multi-label classification cross-entropy loss, where the ground-truth
set of matches is found by solving the Linear Sum Assignment (LSA) optimization
problem, which avoids tedious hand annotation of the training data.
Additionally, posing the loss calculation as multi-label classification permits
supervising on point correspondences directly instead of on odometry error,
which is not feasible for sparse and noisy data from the SoC radar we use. We
evaluate our method with an open-source state-of-the-art Radar-Inertial
Odometry (RIO) framework in real-world Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) flights
and with the widely used public Coloradar dataset. Evaluation shows that the
proposed method improves the position estimation accuracy by over 14 % and 19 %
on average, respectively. The open source code and datasets can be found here:

Motivation: 传统LIO方法在几何结构缺失时容易失效，限制了其广泛应用。PG-LIO旨在通过多模态信息融合解决这一问题。

Method: PG-LIO将LiDAR的光度、几何信息与IMU数据融合，通过滑动窗口因子图优化实现实时操作。

Result: 在几何结构良好和自相似场景中，PG-LIO表现优异，尤其在退化场景中显著优于其他方法，如1公里隧道飞行仅1米漂移。

Conclusion: PG-LIO通过多模态融合提升了LIO的鲁棒性，适用于更广泛的场景，代码将开源以促进社区发展。

Abstract: LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) is widely used for accurate state estimation
and mapping which is an essential requirement for autonomous robots.
Conventional LIO methods typically rely on formulating constraints from the
geometric structure sampled by the LiDAR. Hence, in the lack of geometric
structure, these tend to become ill-conditioned (degenerate) and fail.
Robustness of LIO to such conditions is a necessity for its broader deployment.
To address this, we propose PG-LIO, a real-time LIO method that fuses
photometric and geometric information sampled by the LiDAR along with inertial
constraints from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). This multi-modal
information is integrated into a factor graph optimized over a sliding window
for real-time operation. We evaluate PG-LIO on multiple datasets that include
both geometrically well-conditioned as well as self-similar scenarios. Our
method achieves accuracy on par with state-of-the-art LIO in geometrically
well-structured settings while significantly improving accuracy in degenerate
cases including against methods that also fuse intensity. Notably, we
demonstrate only 1 m drift over a 1 km manually piloted aerial trajectory
through a geometrically self-similar tunnel at an average speed of 7.5m/s (max
speed 10.8 m/s). For the benefit of the community, we shall also release our

Conclusion: NOVA证明了仅依赖机载传感器即可实现高速视觉跟踪，无需外部定位或环境假设。

Abstract: Autonomous aerial target tracking in unstructured and GPS-denied environments
remains a fundamental challenge in robotics. Many existing methods rely on
motion capture systems, pre-mapped scenes, or feature-based localization to
ensure safety and control, limiting their deployment in real-world conditions.
We introduce NOVA, a fully onboard, object-centric framework that enables
robust target tracking and collision-aware navigation using only a stereo
camera and an IMU. Rather than constructing a global map or relying on absolute
localization, NOVA formulates perception, estimation, and control entirely in
the target's reference frame. A tightly integrated stack combines a lightweight
object detector with stereo depth completion, followed by histogram-based
filtering to infer robust target distances under occlusion and noise. These
measurements feed a visual-inertial state estimator that recovers the full
6-DoF pose of the robot relative to the target. A nonlinear model predictive
controller (NMPC) plans dynamically feasible trajectories in the target frame.
To ensure safety, high-order control barrier functions are constructed online
from a compact set of high-risk collision points extracted from depth, enabling
real-time obstacle avoidance without maps or dense representations. We validate
NOVA across challenging real-world scenarios, including urban mazes, forest
trails, and repeated transitions through buildings with intermittent GPS loss
and severe lighting changes that disrupt feature-based localization. Each
experiment is repeated multiple times under similar conditions to assess
resilience, showing consistent and reliable performance. NOVA achieves agile
target following at speeds exceeding 50 km/h. These results show that
high-speed vision-based tracking is possible in the wild using only onboard
sensing, with no reliance on external localization or environment assumptions.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel high-level task planning and optimal coordination
framework for autonomous masonry construction, using a team of heterogeneous
aerial robotic workers, consisting of agents with separate skills for brick
placement and mortar application. This introduces new challenges in scheduling
and coordination, particularly due to the mortar curing deadline required for
structural bonding and ensuring the safety constraints among UAVs operating in
parallel. To address this, an automated pipeline generates the wall
construction plan based on the available bricks while identifying static
structural dependencies and potential conflicts for safe operation. The
proposed framework optimizes UAV task allocation and execution timing by
incorporating dynamically coupled precedence deadline constraints that account
for the curing process and static structural dependency constraints, while
enforcing spatio-temporal constraints to prevent collisions and ensure safety.
The primary objective of the scheduler is to minimize the overall construction
makespan while minimizing logistics, traveling time between tasks, and the
curing time to maintain both adhesion quality and safe workspace separation.
The effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving coordinated and
time-efficient aerial masonry construction is extensively validated through
Gazebo simulated missions. The results demonstrate the framework's capability
to streamline UAV operations, ensuring both structural integrity and safety
during the construction process.

Conclusion: TDACloud是一种高效的点云识别方法，适用于复杂场景，且无需GPU训练。

Abstract: Point cloud-based object/place recognition remains a problem of interest in
applications such as autonomous driving, scene reconstruction, and
localization. Extracting meaningful local descriptors from a query point cloud
that can be matched with the descriptors of the collected point clouds is a
challenging problem. Furthermore, when the query point cloud is noisy or has
been transformed (e.g., rotated), it adds to the complexity. To this end, we
propose a novel methodology, named TDACloud, using Topological Data Analysis
(TDA) for local descriptor extraction from a point cloud, which does not need
resource-intensive GPU-based machine learning training. More specifically, we
used the ATOL vectorization method to generate vectors for point clouds. Unlike
voxelization, our proposed technique can take raw point clouds as inputs and
outputs a fixed-size TDA-descriptor vector. To test the quality of the proposed
TDACloud technique, we have implemented it on multiple real-world (e.g., Oxford

*Bao Thach,Siyeon Kim,Britton Jordan,Mohanraj Shanthi,Tanner Watts,Shing-Hei Ho,James M. Ferguson,Tucker Hermans,Alan Kuntz*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DefFusionNet提出了一种基于扩散概率模型的新方法，用于生成多样化的可变形物体目标形状，解决了多模态任务中单一确定性预测的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如DefGoalNet）在多模态任务中表现不佳，因为它们只能生成单一的平均化目标形状，无法适应多样化的任务需求。

Method: DefFusionNet利用扩散概率模型学习所有有效目标形状的分布，从而生成多样化的目标形状。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在仿真和实际机器人任务中均能有效生成多样化的目标形状，适用于制造和手术应用。

Conclusion: DefFusionNet是首个能够为真实世界机器人应用生成多样化目标形状的生成模型。

Abstract: Deformable object manipulation is critical to many real-world robotic
applications, ranging from surgical robotics and soft material handling in
manufacturing to household tasks like laundry folding. At the core of this
important robotic field is shape servoing, a task focused on controlling
deformable objects into desired shapes. The shape servoing formulation requires
the specification of a goal shape. However, most prior works in shape servoing
rely on impractical goal shape acquisition methods, such as laborious
domain-knowledge engineering or manual manipulation. DefGoalNet previously
posed the current state-of-the-art solution to this problem, which learns
deformable object goal shapes directly from a small number of human
demonstrations. However, it significantly struggles in multi-modal settings,
where multiple distinct goal shapes can all lead to successful task completion.
As a deterministic model, DefGoalNet collapses these possibilities into a
single averaged solution, often resulting in an unusable goal. In this paper,
we address this problem by developing DefFusionNet, a novel neural network that
leverages the diffusion probabilistic model to learn a distribution over all
valid goal shapes rather than predicting a single deterministic outcome. This
enables the generation of diverse goal shapes and avoids the averaging
artifacts. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness on robotic tasks inspired
by both manufacturing and surgical applications, both in simulation and on a
physical robot. Our work is the first generative model capable of producing a
diverse, multi-modal set of deformable object goals for real-world robotic
applications.

Motivation: 在带耗散和约束的系统中，传统辛形式退化，导致稳定性与长期预测失效。本文旨在解决这一基础限制。

Method: 结合循环编码器和流匹配目标学习增强相空间动力学，并附加轻量级SympNet以保持能量、动量和约束。

Result: 在ANYmal四足机器人上验证了方法的有效性，首次填补了约束耗散系统与辛学习之间的空白。

Conclusion: PSNs为几何机器学习开辟了新方向，结合第一性原理与数据适应性。

Abstract: Physics-informed deep learning has achieved remarkable progress by embedding
geometric priors, such as Hamiltonian symmetries and variational principles,
into neural networks, enabling structure-preserving models that extrapolate
with high accuracy. However, in systems with dissipation and holonomic
constraints, ubiquitous in legged locomotion and multibody robotics, the
canonical symplectic form becomes degenerate, undermining the very invariants
that guarantee stability and long-term prediction. In this work, we tackle this
foundational limitation by introducing Presymplectification Networks (PSNs),
the first framework to learn the symplectification lift via Dirac structures,
restoring a non-degenerate symplectic geometry by embedding constrained systems
into a higher-dimensional manifold. Our architecture combines a recurrent
encoder with a flow-matching objective to learn the augmented phase-space
dynamics end-to-end. We then attach a lightweight Symplectic Network (SympNet)
to forecast constrained trajectories while preserving energy, momentum, and
constraint satisfaction. We demonstrate our method on the dynamics of the
ANYmal quadruped robot, a challenging contact-rich, multibody system. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first framework that effectively bridges the
gap between constrained, dissipative mechanical systems and symplectic
learning, unlocking a whole new class of geometric machine learning models,
grounded in first principles yet adaptable from data.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SViP框架通过结合视觉运动策略与任务和运动规划（TAMP），解决了小规模演示数据下视觉运动策略泛化能力不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉运动策略在复杂双手操作任务中表现优异，但其泛化能力受限于小规模演示数据和累积误差，尤其是在长时程任务中。

Method: SViP利用语义场景图监控将演示分解为双手和单手操作，并通过关键场景图的连续决策变量训练切换条件生成器，生成参数化脚本原语。

Result: 仅需20个真实世界演示，SViP即可在未见过的初始条件下实现泛化，并在新任务中自动发现有效解决方案。

Conclusion: SViP在真实实验中优于现有生成式模仿学习方法，展示了其在更复杂任务中的广泛适用性。

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL), particularly when leveraging high-dimensional visual
inputs for policy training, has proven intuitive and effective in complex
bimanual manipulation tasks. Nonetheless, the generalization capability of
visuomotor policies remains limited, especially when small demonstration
datasets are available. Accumulated errors in visuomotor policies significantly
hinder their ability to complete long-horizon tasks. To address these
limitations, we propose SViP, a framework that seamlessly integrates visuomotor
policies into task and motion planning (TAMP). SViP partitions human
demonstrations into bimanual and unimanual operations using a semantic scene
graph monitor. Continuous decision variables from the key scene graph are
employed to train a switching condition generator. This generator produces
parameterized scripted primitives that ensure reliable performance even when
encountering out-of-the-distribution observations. Using only 20 real-world
demonstrations, we show that SViP enables visuomotor policies to generalize
across out-of-distribution initial conditions without requiring object pose
estimators. For previously unseen tasks, SViP automatically discovers effective
solutions to achieve the goal, leveraging constraint modeling in TAMP
formulism. In real-world experiments, SViP outperforms state-of-the-art
generative IL methods, indicating wider applicability for more complex tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用模拟器和多曝光数据集BorealHDR的方法，用于离线评估自动曝光（AE）方法，解决了传统在线评估的不可复现性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准数据集的固定传感器参数限制了主动调整传感器参数的方法（如AE方法）的比较，且传统在线评估方式不可复现。

Method: 使用BorealHDR多曝光立体数据集及其扩展，通过模拟器生成不同曝光时间的图像，离线评估AE方法。

Result: 模拟图像的RMSE低于1.78%，评估了8种AE方法，发现经典AE方法表现最佳。

Conclusion: 提出的离线方法提高了AE方法评估的可复现性，经典AE方法仍最优，并分享了数据采集平台的经验。

Abstract: Standard datasets often present limitations, particularly due to the fixed
nature of input data sensors, which makes it difficult to compare methods that
actively adjust sensor parameters to suit environmental conditions. This is the
case with Automatic-Exposure (AE) methods, which rely on environmental factors
to influence the image acquisition process. As a result, AE methods have
traditionally been benchmarked in an online manner, rendering experiments
non-reproducible. Building on our prior work, we propose a methodology that
utilizes an emulator capable of generating images at any exposure time. This
approach leverages BorealHDR, a unique multi-exposure stereo dataset, along
with its new extension, in which data was acquired along a repeated trajectory
at different times of the day to assess the impact of changing illumination. In
total, BorealHDR covers 13.4 km over 59 trajectories in challenging lighting
conditions. The dataset also includes lidar-inertial-odometry-based maps with
pose estimation for each image frame, as well as Global Navigation Satellite
System (GNSS) data for comparison. We demonstrate that by using images acquired
at various exposure times, we can emulate realistic images with a
Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) below 1.78% compared to ground truth images.
Using this offline approach, we benchmarked eight AE methods, concluding that
the classical AE method remains the field's best performer. To further support
reproducibility, we provide in-depth details on the development of our backpack
acquisition platform, including hardware, electrical components, and
performance specifications. Additionally, we share valuable lessons learned
from deploying the backpack over more than 25 km across various environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高斯溅射SLAM方法局限于小规模室内环境，无法满足多智能体户外场景的需求。

Method: 结合局部子图优化的隐式跟踪模块和多机器人闭环检测的位姿图优化框架。

Result: 在Replica室内数据集上PSNR提升28%，在Kimera-Multi户外数据集上多智能体跟踪误差降低91%。

Conclusion: GRAND-SLAM在多智能体户外SLAM中表现出色，优于现有方法。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting has emerged as an expressive scene representation for
RGB-D visual SLAM, but its application to large-scale, multi-agent outdoor
environments remains unexplored. Multi-agent Gaussian SLAM is a promising
approach to rapid exploration and reconstruction of environments, offering
scalable environment representations, but existing approaches are limited to
small-scale, indoor environments. To that end, we propose Gaussian
Reconstruction via Multi-Agent Dense SLAM, or GRAND-SLAM, a collaborative
Gaussian splatting SLAM method that integrates i) an implicit tracking module
based on local optimization over submaps and ii) an approach to inter- and
intra-robot loop closure integrated into a pose-graph optimization framework.
Experiments show that GRAND-SLAM provides state-of-the-art tracking performance
and 28% higher PSNR than existing methods on the Replica indoor dataset, as
well as 91% lower multi-agent tracking error and improved rendering over
existing multi-agent methods on the large-scale, outdoor Kimera-Multi dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频生成模型（VGMs）在机器人统一世界建模中有潜力，但存在生成速度慢和视频与动作一致性差的问题，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出MinD框架，采用双系统设计：低频VGMs提取视频预测特征，高频扩散策略实现实时交互；引入DiffMatcher模块和协同训练策略对齐表示。

Result: MinD在RL-Bench上实现63%+的操纵性能，作为世界模拟器可预测任务成功率，并在潜在空间评估任务可行性。

Conclusion: MinD通过分层扩散模型和协同训练，显著提升了VGMs在机器人中的实时性和一致性，推动了统一世界建模的发展。

Abstract: Video generation models (VGMs) offer a promising pathway for unified world
modeling in robotics by integrating simulation, prediction, and manipulation.
However, their practical application remains limited due to (1) slowgeneration
speed, which limits real-time interaction, and (2) poor consistency between
imagined videos and executable actions. To address these challenges, we propose
Manipulate in Dream (MinD), a hierarchical diffusion-based world model
framework that employs a dual-system design for vision-language manipulation.
MinD executes VGM at low frequencies to extract video prediction features,
while leveraging a high-frequency diffusion policy for real-time interaction.
This architecture enables low-latency, closed-loop control in manipulation with
coherent visual guidance. To better coordinate the two systems, we introduce a
video-action diffusion matching module (DiffMatcher), with a novel co-training
strategy that uses separate schedulers for each diffusion model. Specifically,
we introduce a diffusion-forcing mechanism to DiffMatcher that aligns their
intermediate representations during training, helping the fast action model
better understand video-based predictions. Beyond manipulation, MinD also
functions as a world simulator, reliably predicting task success or failure in
latent space before execution. Trustworthy analysis further shows that VGMs can
preemptively evaluate task feasibility and mitigate risks. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that MinD achieves
state-of-the-art manipulation (63%+) in RL-Bench, advancing the frontier of
unified world modeling in robotics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了使机器人头部能够展示丰富的面部表情，需要改进现有的自动学习方法。

Method: 采用3D标志点及其成对距离作为学习算法的输入，替代之前的面部动作单元。

Result: 在线调查显示，参与者大多偏好新方法生成的映射，但仍需进一步改进。

Conclusion: 新方法在表情映射上表现更优，但仍有优化空间。

Abstract: The ability to display rich facial expressions is crucial for human-like
robotic heads. While manually defining such expressions is intricate, there
already exist approaches to automatically learn them. In this work one such
approach is applied to evaluate and control a robot head different from the one
in the original study. To improve the mapping of facial expressions from human
actors onto a robot head, it is proposed to use 3D landmarks and their pairwise
distances as input to the learning algorithm instead of the previously used
facial action units. Participants of an online survey preferred mappings from
our proposed approach in most cases, though there are still further
improvements required.

Motivation: 研究旨在理解扩散模型在图像生成中的计算机制，特别是自然数据与合成数据处理的差异，为生成模型的行为提供定量基础和干预策略。

Method: 通过对2,000张合成图像和2,000张CelebA人脸图像进行系统性干预实验，分析计算复杂性和注意力机制。

Result: 研究发现真实人脸处理需要更高计算复杂度（1.084±0.008），并识别了八种功能不同的注意力机制（如边缘检测、纹理分析等），干预实验显示性能下降25.6%至128.3%。

Conclusion: 研究为生成模型的算法理解和行为控制提供了定量基础，通过机制干预策略实现更精确的模型调控。

Abstract: We present a quantitative circuit-level analysis of diffusion models,
establishing computational pathways and mechanistic principles underlying image
generation processes. Through systematic intervention experiments across 2,000
synthetic and 2,000 CelebA facial images, we discover fundamental algorithmic
differences in how diffusion architectures process synthetic versus
naturalistic data distributions. Our investigation reveals that real-world face
processing requires circuits with measurably higher computational complexity
(complexity ratio = 1.084 plus/minus 0.008, p < 0.001), exhibiting distinct
attention specialization patterns with entropy divergence ranging from 0.015 to
0.166 across denoising timesteps. We identify eight functionally distinct
attention mechanisms showing specialized computational roles: edge detection
(entropy = 3.18 plus/minus 0.12), texture analysis (entropy = 4.16 plus/minus
0.08), and semantic understanding (entropy = 2.67 plus/minus 0.15).
Intervention analysis demonstrates critical computational bottlenecks where
targeted ablations produce 25.6% to 128.3% performance degradation, providing
causal evidence for identified circuit functions. These findings establish
quantitative foundations for algorithmic understanding and control of
generative model behavior through mechanistic intervention strategies.

Conclusion: SRKD在现实部署场景中表现出高效性和有效性。

Abstract: 3D point cloud segmentation faces practical challenges due to the
computational complexity and deployment limitations of large-scale
transformer-based models. To address this, we propose a novel Structure- and
Relation-aware Knowledge Distillation framework, named SRKD, that transfers
rich geometric and semantic knowledge from a large frozen teacher model (>100M)
to a lightweight student model (<15M). Specifically, we propose an affinity
matrix-based relation alignment module, which distills structural dependencies
from the teacher to the student through point-wise similarity matching,
enhancing the student's capability to learn contextual interactions. Meanwhile,
we introduce a cross-sample mini-batch construction strategy that enables the
student to perceive stable and generalized geometric structure. This aligns
across diverse point cloud instances of the teacher, rather than within a
single sample. Additionally, KL divergence is applied to align semantic
distributions, and ground-truth supervision further reinforces accurate
segmentation. Our method achieves state of the art performance with
significantly reduced model complexity, demonstrating its effectiveness and
efficiency in real-world deployment scenarios. Our Code is available at

Motivation: 阿拉斯加土壤地图对生态和基础设施至关重要，但传统方法依赖实地工作，难以满足需求。气候变化加速冻土融化，急需高分辨率地图以支持监测和规划。

Method: MISO结合地理空间基础模型、隐式神经表示和对比学习，实现连续空间预测和多模态对齐。

Result: MISO在空间交叉验证和区域分析中表现优于RF，泛化能力更强，召回率更高。

Conclusion: MISO展示了先进机器学习在土壤地图中的潜力，为冻土地区的采样和规划提供指导。

Abstract: Fine-scale soil mapping in Alaska, traditionally relying on fieldwork and
localized simulations, remains a critical yet underdeveloped task, despite the
region's ecological importance and extensive permafrost coverage. As permafrost
thaw accelerates due to climate change, it threatens infrastructure stability
and key ecosystem services, such as soil carbon storage. High-resolution soil
maps are essential for characterizing permafrost distribution, identifying
vulnerable areas, and informing adaptation strategies. We present MISO, a
vision-based machine learning (ML) model to produce statewide fine-scale soil
maps for near-surface permafrost and soil taxonomy. The model integrates a
geospatial foundation model for visual feature extraction, implicit neural
representations for continuous spatial prediction, and contrastive learning for
multimodal alignment and geo-location awareness. We compare MISO with Random
Forest (RF), a traditional ML model that has been widely used in soil mapping
applications. Spatial cross-validation and regional analysis across Permafrost
Zones and Major Land Resource Areas (MLRAs) show that MISO generalizes better
to remote, unseen locations and achieves higher recall than RF, which is
critical for monitoring permafrost thaw and related environmental processes.
These findings demonstrate the potential of advanced ML approaches for
fine-scale soil mapping and provide practical guidance for future soil sampling
and infrastructure planning in permafrost-affected landscapes. The project will
be released at https://github.com/knowledge-computing/Peatland-permafrost.

Motivation: 非订阅制零工平台的用户流失预测因缺乏明确标签和动态行为而具有挑战性，现有方法难以捕捉关键的时间线索。

Method: 将用户行为模式建模为雷达图序列，结合预训练的CNN编码器和双向LSTM，捕捉空间和时间模式。

Conclusion: 该方法模块化设计、可解释性强，适用于动态零工平台的大规模流失建模。

Abstract: Predicting user churn in non-subscription gig platforms, where disengagement
is implicit, poses unique challenges due to the absence of explicit labels and
the dynamic nature of user behavior. Existing methods often rely on aggregated
snapshots or static visual representations, which obscure temporal cues
critical for early detection. In this work, we propose a temporally-aware
computer vision framework that models user behavioral patterns as a sequence of
radar chart images, each encoding day-level behavioral features. By integrating
a pretrained CNN encoder with a bidirectional LSTM, our architecture captures
both spatial and temporal patterns underlying churn behavior. Extensive
experiments on a large real-world dataset demonstrate that our method
outperforms classical models and ViT-based radar chart baselines, yielding
gains of 17.7 in F1 score, 29.4 in precision, and 16.1 in AUC, along with
improved interpretability. The framework's modular design, explainability
tools, and efficient deployment characteristics make it suitable for
large-scale churn modeling in dynamic gig-economy platforms.

Motivation: 老龄化加剧导致老年人跌倒风险增加，尤其在浴室等湿滑环境中，现有单模态系统在复杂环境中准确性不足。

Method: 开发传感器评估框架，融合毫米波雷达和3D振动传感，构建隐私保护的多模态数据集；提出双流网络P2MFDS，结合CNN-BiLSTM-Attention和CNN-SEBlock-Self-Attention分支。

Conclusion: 多模态融合方法有效解决了单模态系统的局限性，为老年人浴室跌倒检测提供了高效隐私保护的解决方案。

Abstract: By 2050, people aged 65 and over are projected to make up 16 percent of the
global population. As aging is closely associated with increased fall risk,
particularly in wet and confined environments such as bathrooms where over 80
percent of falls occur. Although recent research has increasingly focused on
non-intrusive, privacy-preserving approaches that do not rely on wearable
devices or video-based monitoring, these efforts have not fully overcome the
limitations of existing unimodal systems (e.g., WiFi-, infrared-, or
mmWave-based), which are prone to reduced accuracy in complex environments.
These limitations stem from fundamental constraints in unimodal sensing,
including system bias and environmental interference, such as multipath fading
in WiFi-based systems and drastic temperature changes in infrared-based
methods. To address these challenges, we propose a Privacy-Preserving
Multimodal Fall Detection System for Elderly People in Bathroom Environments.
First, we develop a sensor evaluation framework to select and fuse
millimeter-wave radar with 3D vibration sensing, and use it to construct and
preprocess a large-scale, privacy-preserving multimodal dataset in real
bathroom settings, which will be released upon publication. Second, we
introduce P2MFDS, a dual-stream network combining a CNN-BiLSTM-Attention branch
for radar motion dynamics with a multi-scale CNN-SEBlock-Self-Attention branch
for vibration impact detection. By uniting macro- and micro-scale features,
P2MFDS delivers significant gains in accuracy and recall over state-of-the-art
approaches. Code and pretrained models will be made available at:

Motivation: 当前自动驾驶领域的研究和实践过于关注模型和算法，而忽视了数据质量的重要性。本文旨在填补这一空白，提出一种框架以解决多源和多模态数据质量不一致的问题。

Method: 提出一个五层框架（数据层、DQ层、任务层、应用层和目标层），并通过nuScenes数据集上的案例研究验证了部分去除多源图像数据冗余可提升YOLOv8目标检测任务性能。

Result: 案例研究表明，部分去除冗余数据可提升任务性能；多模态数据（图像和LiDAR）分析揭示了现有冗余DQ问题。

Conclusion: 本文为自动驾驶领域提出了一个关键但未被充分探索的方向，即数据质量、任务编排和性能导向系统开发的结合，有望推动构建更具适应性、可解释性和鲁棒性的自动驾驶系统。

Abstract: The next-generation autonomous vehicles (AVs), embedded with frequent
real-time decision-making, will rely heavily on a large volume of multisource
and multimodal data. In real-world settings, the data quality (DQ) of different
sources and modalities usually varies due to unexpected environmental factors
or sensor issues. However, both researchers and practitioners in the AV field
overwhelmingly concentrate on models/algorithms while undervaluing the DQ. To
fulfill the needs of the next-generation AVs with guarantees of functionality,
efficiency, and trustworthiness, this paper proposes a novel task-centric and
data quality vase framework which consists of five layers: data layer, DQ
layer, task layer, application layer, and goal layer. The proposed framework
aims to map DQ with task requirements and performance goals. To illustrate, a
case study investigating redundancy on the nuScenes dataset proves that
partially removing redundancy on multisource image data could improve YOLOv8
object detection task performance. Analysis on multimodal data of image and
LiDAR further presents existing redundancy DQ issues. This paper opens up a
range of critical but unexplored challenges at the intersection of DQ, task
orchestration, and performance-oriented system development in AVs. It is
expected to guide the AV community toward building more adaptive, explainable,
and resilient AVs that respond intelligently to dynamic environments and
heterogeneous data streams. Code, data, and implementation details are publicly

Abstract: Even without auxiliary images, single hyperspectral image super-resolution

efficient feedback gate network, which uses various feedbacks and gate
operations involving large kernel convolutions and spectral interactions. In
particular, by providing different guidance for neighboring groups, we can
learn rich band information and hierarchical hyperspectral spatial information
using channel shuffling and dilatation convolution in shuffled and progressive
dilated fusion module(SPDFM). Moreover, we develop a wide-bound perception gate
block and a spectrum enhancement gate block to construct the spatial-spectral
reinforcement gate module (SSRGM) and obtain highly representative
spatial-spectral features efficiently. Additionally, we apply a
three-dimensional SSRGM to enhance holistic information and coherence for
hyperspectral data. The experimental results on three hyperspectral datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed network over the
state-of-the-art methods in terms of spectral fidelity and spatial content
reconstruction.

### [60] [From Drawings to Decisions: A Hybrid Vision-Language Framework for Parsing 2D Engineering Drawings into Structured Manufacturing Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17374)
*Muhammad Tayyab Khan,Lequn Chen,Zane Yong,Jun Ming Tan,Wenhe Feng,Seung Ki Moon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合旋转感知目标检测模型和视觉语言解析器的混合框架，用于高效提取2D工程图中的关键信息，并在实际制造任务中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动提取2D工程图中的关键信息效率低且不可靠，通用OCR模型因复杂布局和工程符号表现不佳，因此需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用YOLOv11-OBB模型定位注释并提取定向边界框（OBB）补丁，再通过微调的轻量级视觉语言模型（VLM）解析为结构化输出。

Result: Donut模型表现优于Florence-2，精度达88.5%，召回率99.2%，F1分数93.5%，幻觉率为11.5%。

Conclusion: 该框架在提取结构化信息支持下游制造任务方面具有实际应用价值，推动了2D工程图解释的现代化。

Abstract: Efficient and accurate extraction of key information from 2D engineering
drawings is essential for advancing digital manufacturing workflows. Such
information includes geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T), measures,
material specifications, and textual annotations. Manual extraction is slow and
labor-intensive, while generic OCR models often fail due to complex layouts,
engineering symbols, and rotated text, leading to incomplete and unreliable
outputs. These limitations result in incomplete and unreliable outputs. To
address these challenges, we propose a hybrid vision-language framework that
integrates a rotation-aware object detection model (YOLOv11-obb) with a
transformer-based vision-language parser. Our structured pipeline applies
YOLOv11-OBB to localize annotations and extract oriented bounding box (OBB)
patches, which are then parsed into structured outputs using a fine-tuned,
lightweight vision-language model (VLM). We curate a dataset of 1,367 2D
mechanical drawings annotated across nine key categories. YOLOv11-OBB is
trained on this dataset to detect OBBs and extract annotation patches. These
are parsed using two open-source VLMs: Donut and Florence-2. Both models are
lightweight and well-suited for specialized industrial tasks under limited
computational overhead. Following fine-tuning of both models on the curated
dataset of image patches paired with structured annotation labels, a
comparative experiment is conducted to evaluate parsing performance across four
key metrics. Donut outperforms Florence-2, achieving 88.5% precision, 99.2%
recall, and a 93.5% F1-score, with a hallucination rate of 11.5%. Finally, a
case study demonstrates how the extracted structured information supports
downstream manufacturing tasks such as process and tool selection, showcasing
the practical utility of the proposed framework in modernizing 2D drawing
interpretation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为STPT的自监督学习方法，用于自动化预测体外受精（IVF）胚胎的存活率，解决了现有方法在处理胚胎发育视频时的内存和时序对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于标记的妊娠结果数据有限，且传统自监督学习方法无法直接应用于胚胎发育视频，论文旨在解决视频长度不一和异常帧导致的语义对齐问题。

Method: STPT分为空间和时间两个阶段：空间阶段学习视频内对齐和增强，时间阶段建模视频嵌入关系，避免逐帧对齐以减少内存需求。

Result: 在23,027个胚胎视频（3,286个标记）上，STPT以0.635的AUC（95% CI: 0.632-0.638）优于基线方法。

Conclusion: STPT方法在有限计算资源下高效处理长视频和时序变化，显著提升了胚胎存活率预测性能。

Abstract: Automating embryo viability prediction for in vitro fertilization (IVF) is
important but challenging due to the limited availability of labeled pregnancy
outcome data, as only a small fraction of embryos are labeled after transfer.
Self-supervised learning (SSL) can leverage both labeled and unlabeled data to
improve prediction. However, existing SSL methods for videos are not directly
applicable to embryo development videos due to two challenges: (1) embryo
time-lapse videos contain hundreds of frames, requiring significant GPU memory
for conventional SSL; (2) the dataset contains videos with varying lengths and
many outlier frames, causing traditional video alignment methods to struggle
with semantic misalignment. We propose Spatial-Temporal Pre-Training (STPT) to
address these challenges. STPT includes two stages: spatial and temporal. In
each stage, only one encoder is trained while the other is frozen, reducing
memory demands. To handle temporal misalignment, STPT avoids frame-by-frame
alignment across videos. The spatial stage learns from alignments within each
video and its temporally consistent augmentations. The temporal stage then
models relationships between video embeddings. Our method efficiently handles
long videos and temporal variability. On 23,027 time-lapse videos (3,286
labeled), STPT achieves the highest AUC of 0.635 (95% CI: 0.632-0.638) compared
to baselines, with limited computational resources.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Vision Mamba RNN（VMRNN）和状态空间模型（SSM）的方法，结合不对称模块，有效捕捉乳腺组织演变的细微趋势，显著提高了癌症发病预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺癌是全球主要死因之一，现有筛查方法多依赖单次检测，而临床实践中更关注时间动态变化。现有方法在利用纵向影像数据的丰富时间动态方面仍有挑战。

Method: 采用VMRNN结合SSM和LSTM类记忆机制，并引入不对称模块（SAD和LAT）来识别临床相关的双侧差异。

Result: 在预测癌症发病方面表现显著提升，尤其对高密度乳腺病例和远期时间点（第四和第五年）效果更优。

Conclusion: 该方法有望推动乳腺癌早期识别，并为个性化筛查策略提供支持。

Abstract: Breast cancer remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide and is typically
detected via screening programs where healthy people are invited in regular
intervals. Automated risk prediction approaches have the potential to improve
this process by facilitating dynamically screening of high-risk groups. While
most models focus solely on the most recent screening, there is growing
interest in exploiting temporal information to capture evolving trends in
breast tissue, as inspired by clinical practice. Early methods typically relied
on two time steps, and although recent efforts have extended this to multiple
time steps using Transformer architectures, challenges remain in fully
harnessing the rich temporal dynamics inherent in longitudinal imaging data. In
this work, we propose to instead leverage Vision Mamba RNN (VMRNN) with a
state-space model (SSM) and LSTM-like memory mechanisms to effectively capture
nuanced trends in breast tissue evolution. To further enhance our approach, we
incorporate an asymmetry module that utilizes a Spatial Asymmetry Detector
(SAD) and Longitudinal Asymmetry Tracker (LAT) to identify clinically relevant
bilateral differences. This integrated framework demonstrates notable
improvements in predicting cancer onset, especially for the more challenging
high-density breast cases and achieves superior performance at extended time
points (years four and five), highlighting its potential to advance early
breast cancer recognition and enable more personalized screening strategies.

TL;DR: 论文提出Trans-CBCT和Trans²-CBCT模型，结合CNN-Transformer和点几何推理，显著提升稀疏视图CBCT重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决稀疏视图CBCT重建中的严重欠采样导致的伪影和空间覆盖不足问题。

Method: 1. 使用TransUNet替代传统编码器，结合CNN和Transformer；2. 引入邻居感知点Transformer增强体积一致性。

Result: 在LUNA16数据集上，Trans-CBCT比基线提升1.17 dB PSNR和0.0163 SSIM；Trans²-CBCT进一步提升0.63 dB PSNR和0.0117 SSIM。

Conclusion: 结合CNN-Transformer特征与点几何推理，有效提升稀疏视图CBCT重建性能。

Abstract: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) using only a few X-ray projection views
enables faster scans with lower radiation dose, but the resulting severe
under-sampling causes strong artifacts and poor spatial coverage. We address
these challenges in a unified framework. First, we replace conventional
UNet/ResNet encoders with TransUNet, a hybrid CNN-Transformer model.
Convolutional layers capture local details, while self-attention layers enhance
global context. We adapt TransUNet to CBCT by combining multi-scale features,
querying view-specific features per 3D point, and adding a lightweight
attenuation-prediction head. This yields Trans-CBCT, which surpasses prior
baselines by 1.17 dB PSNR and 0.0163 SSIM on the LUNA16 dataset with six views.
Second, we introduce a neighbor-aware Point Transformer to enforce volumetric
coherence. This module uses 3D positional encoding and attention over k-nearest
neighbors to improve spatial consistency. The resulting model, Trans$^2$-CBCT,
provides an additional gain of 0.63 dB PSNR and 0.0117 SSIM. Experiments on
LUNA16 and ToothFairy show consistent gains from six to ten views, validating
the effectiveness of combining CNN-Transformer features with point-based
geometry reasoning for sparse-view CBCT reconstruction.

Conclusion: CNN-Bi-GRU模型在RF设备识别中表现出色，适用于复杂无线环境中的设备分类。

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid growth of the Internet of Things technologies and
the widespread adoption of 5G wireless networks have led to an exponential
increase in the number of radiation devices operating in complex
electromagnetic environments. A key challenge in managing and securing these
devices is accurate identification and classification. To address this
challenge, specific emitter identification techniques have emerged as a
promising solution that aims to provide reliable and efficient means of
identifying individual radiation devices in a unified and standardized manner.
This research proposes an approach that leverages transient energy spectrum
analysis using the General Linear Chirplet Transform to extract features from
RF devices. A dataset comprising nine RF devices is utilized, with each sample
containing 900 attributes and a total of 1080 equally distributed samples
across the devices. These features are then used in a classification modeling
framework. To overcome the limitations of conventional machine learning
methods, we introduce a hybrid deep learning model called the CNN-Bi-GRU for
learning the identification of RF devices based on their transient
characteristics. The proposed approach provided a 10-fold cross-validation
performance with a precision of 99.33%, recall of 99.53%, F1-score of 99.43%,
and classification accuracy of 99.17%. The results demonstrate the promising
classification performance of the CNN-Bi-GRU approach, indicating its
suitability for accurately identifying RF devices based on their transient
characteristics and its potential for enhancing device identification and
classification in complex wireless environments.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is essential for the safety and reliability of autonomous

response time, which is critical in time-sensitive driving scenarios. In this
paper, we introduce real-time anomaly detection for autonomous driving,
prioritizing both minimal response time and high accuracy. We propose a novel
multimodal asynchronous hybrid network that combines event streams from event
cameras with image data from RGB cameras. Our network utilizes the high
temporal resolution of event cameras through an asynchronous Graph Neural
Network and integrates it with spatial features extracted by a CNN from RGB
images. This combination effectively captures both the temporal dynamics and
spatial details of the driving environment, enabling swift and precise anomaly
detection. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach
outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and response time, achieving
millisecond-level real-time performance.

Result: 实验表明，现有方法在现实条件下性能下降，而提出的方法在多种任务中表现稳健且高效。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法为医学图像分析中的VLMs提供了一种高效、鲁棒的适应方案，适用于现实场景。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are gaining attention in medical image
analysis. These are pre-trained on large, heterogeneous data sources, yielding
rich and transferable representations. Notably, the combination of
modality-specialized VLMs with few-shot adaptation has provided fruitful
results, enabling the efficient deployment of high-performing solutions.
However, previous works on this topic make strong assumptions about the
distribution of adaptation data, which are unrealistic in the medical domain.
First, prior art assumes access to a balanced support set, a condition that
breaks the natural imbalance in disease prevalence found in real-world
scenarios. Second, these works typically assume the presence of an additional
validation set to fix critical hyper-parameters, which is highly
data-inefficient. This work challenges these favorable deployment scenarios and
introduces a realistic, imbalanced, validation-free adaptation setting. Our
extensive benchmark across various modalities and downstream tasks demonstrates
that current methods systematically compromise their performance when operating
under realistic conditions, occasionally even performing worse than zero-shot
inference. Also, we introduce a training-free linear probe that adaptively
blends visual and textual supervision. Detailed studies demonstrate that the
proposed solver is a strong, efficient baseline, enabling robust adaptation in
challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: SCA-T为医学VLM的迁移学习提供了一种更可靠的预测框架，适用于多种图像模态和任务。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented
transfer capabilities and are being increasingly adopted for data-efficient
image classification. Despite its growing popularity, its reliability aspect
remains largely unexplored. This work explores the split conformal prediction
(SCP) framework to provide trustworthiness guarantees when transferring such
models based on a small labeled calibration set. Despite its potential, the
generalist nature of the VLMs' pre-training could negatively affect the
properties of the predicted conformal sets for specific tasks. While common
practice in transfer learning for discriminative purposes involves an
adaptation stage, we observe that deploying such a solution for conformal
purposes is suboptimal since adapting the model using the available calibration
data breaks the rigid exchangeability assumptions for test data in SCP. To
address this issue, we propose transductive split conformal adaptation (SCA-T),
a novel pipeline for transfer learning on conformal scenarios, which performs
an unsupervised transductive adaptation jointly on calibration and test data.
We present comprehensive experiments utilizing medical VLMs across various
image modalities, transfer tasks, and non-conformity scores. Our framework
offers consistent gains in efficiency and conditional coverage compared to SCP,
maintaining the same empirical guarantees.

Abstract: Despite its importance for performance and injury prevention, golf swing
analysis is limited by isolated metrics, underrepresentation of professional
athletes, and a lack of rich, interpretable movement representations. We
address these gaps with a holistic, data-driven framework for personalized golf
swing analysis from a single wrist-worn sensor. We build a large dataset of
professional swings from publicly available videos, reconstruct full-body 3D
kinematics using biologically accurate human mesh recovery, and generate
synthetic inertial data to train neural networks that infer motion and segment
swing phases from wrist-based input. We learn a compositional, discrete
vocabulary of motion primitives that facilitates the detection and
visualization of technical flaws, and is expressive enough to predict player
identity, club type, sex, and age. Our system accurately estimates full-body
kinematics and swing events from wrist data, delivering lab-grade motion
analysis on-course and supporting early detection of anomalous movement
patterns. Explainability methods reveal subtle, individualized movement
signatures, reinforcing the view that variability is a hallmark of skilled
performance. Longitudinal tracking demonstrates practical value: as one
player's handicap improved from 50 to 2.2 over 1.5 years, our system captured
measurable technical progress and provided targeted, actionable feedback. Our
findings challenge common assumptions, such as swing consistency across clubs
and the existence of a single "ideal" swing, and uncover latent biomarkers
shaped by both intrinsic traits and task-specific constraints. This work
bridges lab and field-based biomechanics, offering scalable, accessible,
high-fidelity motion analysis for research, coaching, and injury prevention,
while opening new directions in movement-based phenotyping, personalized
equipment design, and motor skill development.

Result: 在多个数据集上超越现有开放词汇基线，提供透明推理步骤。

Conclusion: 强化学习与RGB-D视频结合为高效、可信的3D场景理解提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Currently, utilizing large language models to understand the 3D world is
becoming popular. Yet existing 3D-aware LLMs act as black boxes: they output
bounding boxes or textual answers without revealing how those decisions are
made, and they still rely on pre-trained 3D detectors to supply object
proposals. We introduce Scene-R1, a video-grounded framework that learns to
reason about 3D scenes without any point-wise 3D instance supervision by
pairing reinforcement-learning-driven reasoning with a two-stage grounding
pipeline. In the temporal grounding stage, we explicitly reason about the video
and select the video snippets most relevant to an open-ended query. In the
subsequent image grounding stage, we analyze the image and predict the 2D
bounding box. After that, we track the object using SAM2 to produce
pixel-accurate masks in RGB frames, and project them back into 3D, thereby
eliminating the need for 3D detector-based proposals while capturing fine
geometry and material cues. Scene-R1 can also adapt to the 3D visual question
answering task to answer free-form questions directly from video. Our training
pipeline only needs task-level 2D boxes or textual labels without dense 3D
point-wise labels. Scene-R1 surpasses existing open-vocabulary baselines on
multiple datasets, while delivering transparent, step-by-step rationales. These
results show that reinforcement-learning-based reasoning combined with RGB-D
video alone offers a practical, annotation-efficient route to trustworthy 3D
scene understanding.

Abstract: Learning to infer object representations, and in particular part-whole
hierarchies, has been the focus of extensive research in computer vision, in
pursuit of improving data efficiency, systematic generalisation, and
robustness. Models which are \emph{designed} to infer part-whole hierarchies,
often referred to as capsule networks, are typically trained end-to-end on
supervised tasks such as object classification, in which case it is difficult
to evaluate whether such a model \emph{actually} learns to infer part-whole
hierarchies, as claimed. To address this difficulty, we present a SYNthetic
DAtaset for CApsule Testing and Evaluation, abbreviated as SynDaCaTE, and
establish its utility by (1) demonstrating the precise bottleneck in a
prominent existing capsule model, and (2) demonstrating that
permutation-equivariant self-attention is highly effective for parts-to-wholes
inference, which motivates future directions for designing effective inductive
biases for computer vision.

Abstract: Recent studies on Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shifted from the
end-to-end action-generation paradigm toward a pipeline involving task planning
followed by action generation, demonstrating improved performance on various
complex, long-horizon manipulation tasks. However, existing approaches vary
significantly in terms of network architectures, planning paradigms,
representations, and training data sources, making it challenging for
researchers to identify the precise sources of performance gains and components
to be further improved. To systematically investigate the impacts of different
planning paradigms and representations isolating from network architectures and
training data, in this paper, we introduce VLA-OS, a unified VLA architecture
series capable of various task planning paradigms, and design a comprehensive
suite of controlled experiments across diverse object categories (rigid and
deformable), visual modalities (2D and 3D), environments (simulation and
real-world), and end-effectors (grippers and dexterous hands). Our results
demonstrate that: 1) visually grounded planning representations are generally
better than language planning representations; 2) the Hierarchical-VLA paradigm
generally achieves superior or comparable performance than other paradigms on
task performance, pretraining, generalization ability, scalability, and
continual learning ability, albeit at the cost of slower training and inference
speeds.

*Haoxuan Che,Haibo Jin,Zhengrui Guo,Yi Lin,Cheng Jin,Hao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedMRG是首个利用联邦学习（FL）开发隐私保护的、多中心LLM驱动医学报告生成（MRG）模型的框架，解决了数据分散和通信效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像-报告数据分散且隐私受限，阻碍了LLM驱动的MRG模型发展。

Method: 采用低秩分解减少通信开销，结合客户端感知对比学习和双适配器机制处理数据异质性。

Result: FedMRG在多中心数据中表现出良好的泛化性和适应性，生成临床准确报告。

Conclusion: FedMRG为多中心MRG开发提供了高效、隐私保护的解决方案。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated significant potential in Medical Report Generation
(MRG), yet their development requires large amounts of medical image-report
pairs, which are commonly scattered across multiple centers. Centralizing these
data is exceptionally challenging due to privacy regulations, thereby impeding
model development and broader adoption of LLM-driven MRG models. To address
this challenge, we present FedMRG, the first framework that leverages Federated
Learning (FL) to enable privacy-preserving, multi-center development of
LLM-driven MRG models, specifically designed to overcome the critical challenge
of communication-efficient LLM training under multi-modal data heterogeneity.
To start with, our framework tackles the fundamental challenge of communication
overhead in FL-LLM tuning by employing low-rank factorization to efficiently
decompose parameter updates, significantly reducing gradient transmission costs
and making LLM-driven MRG feasible in bandwidth-constrained FL settings.
Furthermore, we observed the dual heterogeneity in MRG under the FL scenario:
varying image characteristics across medical centers, as well as diverse
reporting styles and terminology preferences. To address this, we further
enhance FedMRG with (1) client-aware contrastive learning in the MRG encoder,
coupled with diagnosis-driven prompts, which capture both globally
generalizable and locally distinctive features while maintaining diagnostic
accuracy; and (2) a dual-adapter mutual boosting mechanism in the MRG decoder
that harmonizes generic and specialized adapters to address variations in
reporting styles and terminology. Through extensive evaluation of our
established FL-MRG benchmark, we demonstrate the generalizability and
adaptability of FedMRG, underscoring its potential in harnessing multi-center
data and generating clinically accurate reports while maintaining communication
efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大视觉语言模型（LVLM）在生成文本时可能出现的视觉不接地幻觉问题，避免依赖数据微调或解码策略的资源消耗。

Method: 提出HalluRNN架构，采用跨层循环推理的双门深度传播单元（DG-DPU）模块，自适应传播信息并增强层间一致性。

Result: 仅微调DG-DPU模块，HalluRNN在多个基准测试中表现出强大且稳健的性能。

Conclusion: HalluRNN通过架构创新有效减少幻觉问题，提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Though Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable
performance across various tasks, they are still prone to
hallucinations-generating outputs that are textually plausible but visually
ungrounded. While prior approaches generally address this issue through
data-centric fine-tuning or innovative decoding strategies, these methods often
require substantial resources or task-specific configurations. In this work, we
introduce an architecture-level solution, HalluRNN, which enhances model
stability through recurrent cross-layer reasoning. Specifically, we propose a
novel Dual-Gated Depth Propagation Unit (DG-DPU) module, which is shared across
layers and recurrently refines hidden states. This allows for the adaptive
propagation of information throughout the model, enforces consistency across
layers, and mitigates hallucinations caused by representational drift. By
fine-tuning only the DG-DPU module, HalluRNN achieves strong and robust
performance across multiple benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视觉语言模型在细粒度意图推理方面的不足，并填补多类意图预测在安全关键场景中的评估空白。

Method: 通过自动化标注流程构建DRAMA-X基准，提出SGG-Intent框架，结合场景图和大型语言模型进行推理。

Result: 实验表明，基于场景图的推理能显著提升意图预测和风险评估的准确性。

Conclusion: DRAMA-X为自动驾驶决策提供了结构化评估工具，SGG-Intent框架展示了上下文建模的重要性。

Abstract: Understanding the short-term motion of vulnerable road users (VRUs) like
pedestrians and cyclists is critical for safe autonomous driving, especially in
urban scenarios with ambiguous or high-risk behaviors. While vision-language
models (VLMs) have enabled open-vocabulary perception, their utility for
fine-grained intent reasoning remains underexplored. Notably, no existing
benchmark evaluates multi-class intent prediction in safety-critical
situations, To address this gap, we introduce DRAMA-X, a fine-grained benchmark
constructed from the DRAMA dataset via an automated annotation pipeline.
DRAMA-X contains 5,686 accident-prone frames labeled with object bounding
boxes, a nine-class directional intent taxonomy, binary risk scores,
expert-generated action suggestions for the ego vehicle, and descriptive motion
summaries. These annotations enable a structured evaluation of four
interrelated tasks central to autonomous decision-making: object detection,
intent prediction, risk assessment, and action suggestion. As a reference
baseline, we propose SGG-Intent, a lightweight, training-free framework that
mirrors the ego vehicle's reasoning pipeline. It sequentially generates a scene
graph from visual input using VLM-backed detectors, infers intent, assesses
risk, and recommends an action using a compositional reasoning stage powered by
a large language model. We evaluate a range of recent VLMs, comparing
performance across all four DRAMA-X tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that
scene-graph-based reasoning enhances intent prediction and risk assessment,
especially when contextual cues are explicitly modeled.

TL;DR: SELFI框架通过动态调节身份特征的使用，提升了深度伪造检测的泛化能力，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决身份特征在深度伪造检测中的矛盾使用问题，提出一种自适应控制身份特征的方法。

Method: 提出SELFI框架，包括FAIA提取身份嵌入并投影到伪造相关空间，以及IAFM选择性融合身份和视觉特征。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，SELFI平均AUC提升3.1%，在DFDC数据集上提升6%。

Conclusion: 身份特征应被明确建模和自适应控制，SELFI框架展示了其有效性。

Abstract: Face identity provides a powerful signal for deepfake detection. Prior
studies show that even when not explicitly modeled, classifiers often learn
identity features implicitly. This has led to conflicting views: some suppress
identity cues to reduce bias, while others rely on them as forensic evidence.
To reconcile these views, we analyze two hypotheses: (1) whether face identity
alone is discriminative for detecting deepfakes, and (2) whether such identity
features generalize poorly across manipulation methods. Our experiments confirm
that identity is informative but context-dependent. While some manipulations
preserve identity-consistent artifacts, others distort identity cues and harm
generalization. We argue that identity features should neither be blindly
suppressed nor relied upon, but instead be explicitly modeled and adaptively
controlled based on per-sample relevance. We propose \textbf{SELFI}
(\textbf{SEL}ective \textbf{F}usion of \textbf{I}dentity), a generalizable
detection framework that dynamically modulates identity usage. SELFI consists
of: (1) a Forgery-Aware Identity Adapter (FAIA) that extracts identity
embeddings from a frozen face recognition model and projects them into a
forgery-relevant space via auxiliary supervision; and (2) an Identity-Aware
Fusion Module (IAFM) that selectively integrates identity and visual features
using a relevance-guided fusion mechanism. Experiments on four benchmarks show
that SELFI improves cross-manipulation generalization, outperforming prior
methods by an average of 3.1\% AUC. On the challenging DFDC dataset, SELFI
exceeds the previous best by 6\%. Code will be released upon paper acceptance.

Motivation: 帕金森病（PD）的不可治愈性、快速进展和严重残疾对患者及其家庭造成巨大挑战，老龄化社会对早期检测的需求增加。现有体外诊断方法存在训练数据不足、设备要求高和单模态误诊风险等问题。

Method: 采用轻量级深度学习模型进行特征提取和融合，结合面部表情和行为步态数据，旨在提高诊断准确性并便于移动设备部署。

Result: 建立了最大的多模态PD数据集，并通过实验验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为PD的早期检测提供了一种高效、低成本且易于推广的解决方案。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD), characterized by its incurable nature, rapid
progression, and severe disability, poses significant challenges to the lives
of patients and their families. Given the aging population, the need for early
detection of PD is increasing. In vitro diagnosis has garnered attention due to
its non-invasive nature and low cost. However, existing methods present several
challenges: 1) limited training data for facial expression diagnosis; 2)
specialized equipment and acquisition environments required for gait diagnosis,
resulting in poor generalizability; 3) the risk of misdiagnosis or missed
diagnosis when relying on a single modality. To address these issues, we
propose a novel multimodal in vitro diagnostic method for PD, leveraging facial
expressions and behavioral gait. Our method employs a lightweight deep learning
model for feature extraction and fusion, aimed at improving diagnostic accuracy
and facilitating deployment on mobile devices. Furthermore, we have established
the largest multimodal PD dataset in collaboration with a hospital and
conducted extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our proposed
method.

Motivation: 开发一个可解释且对脑MRI扫描中的人口统计学和技术差异具有鲁棒性的年龄预测模型。

Method: 采用基于Transformer的架构，结合自监督预训练和大规模数据集处理伪3D T1加权MRI扫描，引入stem架构降低计算复杂度。

Result: 在ADNI2 & 3和OASIS3测试集上MAE为3.65年，AIBL数据集上MAE为3.54年，脑年龄差与认知能力显著相关。

Conclusion: 模型融合多视角和体积信息，实现了高精度、高泛化性和可解释性的脑年龄预测，并与神经退行性疾病相关。

Abstract: Purpose: To develop an age prediction model which is interpretable and robust
to demographic and technological variances in brain MRI scans. Materials and
Methods: We propose a transformer-based architecture that leverages
self-supervised pre-training on large-scale datasets. Our model processes
pseudo-3D T1-weighted MRI scans from three anatomical views and incorporates
brain volumetric information. By introducing a stem architecture, we reduce the
conventional quadratic complexity of transformer models to linear complexity,
enabling scalability for high-dimensional MRI data. We trained our model on
ADNI2 $\&$ 3 (N=1348) and OASIS3 (N=716) datasets (age range: 42 - 95) from the
North America, with an 8:1:1 split for train, validation and test. Then, we
validated it on the AIBL dataset (N=768, age range: 60 - 92) from Australia.
Results: We achieved an MAE of 3.65 years on ADNI2 $\&$ 3 and OASIS3 test set
and a high generalizability of MAE of 3.54 years on AIBL. There was a notable
increase in brain age gap (BAG) across cognitive groups, with mean of 0.15
years (95% CI: [-0.22, 0.51]) in CN, 2.55 years ([2.40, 2.70]) in MCI, 6.12
years ([5.82, 6.43]) in AD. Additionally, significant negative correlation
between BAG and cognitive scores was observed, with correlation coefficient of
-0.185 (p < 0.001) for MoCA and -0.231 (p < 0.001) for MMSE. Gradient-based
feature attribution highlighted ventricles and white matter structures as key
regions influenced by brain aging. Conclusion: Our model effectively fused
information from different views and volumetric information to achieve
state-of-the-art brain age prediction accuracy, improved generalizability and
interpretability with association to neurodegenerative disorders.

Motivation: 高分辨率图像特征在多模态大语言模型中表现优异，但计算成本高昂，需多次调用大型图像编码器。

Method: 提出浅层特征增强器，通过特征上采样生成高分辨率特征，减少计算开销。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在训练和推理时间上大幅减少，计算成本降低1.5倍FLOPs，同时保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 浅层特征增强器是高效且高性能的高分辨率特征生成方法。

Abstract: The integration of high-resolution image features in modern multimodal large
language models has demonstrated significant improvements in fine-grained
visual understanding tasks, achieving high performance across multiple
benchmarks. Since these features are obtained from large image encoders like
ViT, they come with a significant increase in computational costs due to
multiple calls to these encoders. In this work, we first develop an intuition
for feature upsampling as a natural extension of high-resolution feature
generation. Through extensive experiments and ablations, we demonstrate how a
shallow feature enricher can achieve competitive results with tremendous
reductions in training and inference time as well as computational cost, with
upto 1.5x saving in FLOPs.

Motivation: 解决专业修图工具的高门槛和现有AI解决方案的局限性，满足多样化和个性化编辑需求。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：Chain-of-Thought监督微调建立基础推理能力，GRPO-R优化决策和工具使用；提出Agent-to-Lightroom协议。

Result: 在MMArt-Bench上表现优异，像素级指标提升60%，同时保持指令跟随能力。

Conclusion: JarvisArt为智能修图开辟了新途径，结合了用户友好性和专业级控制。

Abstract: Photo retouching has become integral to contemporary visual storytelling,
enabling users to capture aesthetics and express creativity. While professional
tools such as Adobe Lightroom offer powerful capabilities, they demand
substantial expertise and manual effort. In contrast, existing AI-based
solutions provide automation but often suffer from limited adjustability and
poor generalization, failing to meet diverse and personalized editing needs. To
bridge this gap, we introduce JarvisArt, a multi-modal large language model
(MLLM)-driven agent that understands user intent, mimics the reasoning process
of professional artists, and intelligently coordinates over 200 retouching
tools within Lightroom. JarvisArt undergoes a two-stage training process: an
initial Chain-of-Thought supervised fine-tuning to establish basic reasoning
and tool-use skills, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization for
Retouching (GRPO-R) to further enhance its decision-making and tool
proficiency. We also propose the Agent-to-Lightroom Protocol to facilitate
seamless integration with Lightroom. To evaluate performance, we develop
MMArt-Bench, a novel benchmark constructed from real-world user edits.
JarvisArt demonstrates user-friendly interaction, superior generalization, and
fine-grained control over both global and local adjustments, paving a new
avenue for intelligent photo retouching. Notably, it outperforms GPT-4o with a
60% improvement in average pixel-level metrics on MMArt-Bench for content
fidelity, while maintaining comparable instruction-following capabilities.

Motivation: 解决EVR中复杂指令和长时序视频的挑战，弥补现有方法在视觉细节和逐步推理上的不足。

Method: 利用LLMs进行高层任务规划，结合VLMs的开放世界视觉感知，通过动态认知地图迭代更新场景上下文。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，尤其在长时序视觉依赖任务中效果显著。

Conclusion: CLiViS通过LLMs和VLMs的协同作用，有效提升了视觉推理能力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Embodied Visual Reasoning (EVR) seeks to follow complex, free-form
instructions based on egocentric video, enabling semantic understanding and
spatiotemporal reasoning in dynamic environments. Despite its promising
potential, EVR encounters significant challenges stemming from the diversity of
complex instructions and the intricate spatiotemporal dynamics in long-term
egocentric videos. Prior solutions either employ Large Language Models (LLMs)
over static video captions, which often omit critical visual details, or rely
on end-to-end Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that struggle with stepwise
compositional reasoning. Consider the complementary strengths of LLMs in
reasoning and VLMs in perception, we propose CLiViS. It is a novel
training-free framework that leverages LLMs for high-level task planning and
orchestrates VLM-driven open-world visual perception to iteratively update the
scene context. Building on this synergy, the core of CLiViS is a dynamic
Cognitive Map that evolves throughout the reasoning process. This map
constructs a structured representation of the embodied scene, bridging
low-level perception and high-level reasoning. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of CLiViS,
especially in handling long-term visual dependencies. Code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了PatchHunter，一种无需优化的对抗性补丁攻击方法，针对立体深度估计（SDE）模型，具有更强的现实适应性和迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SDE模型对抗攻击方法在现实场景中适用性有限，因此需要设计一种物理可实现、场景自适应且可迁移的攻击方法。

Method: 提出PatchHunter，通过强化学习驱动的搜索在视觉模式结构化空间中生成补丁，破坏SDE假设。

Result: PatchHunter在KITTI数据集、CARLA模拟器和真实车辆部署中表现优异，攻击成功率高且迁移性强。

Conclusion: PatchHunter为SDE模型对抗攻击提供了更有效的解决方案，尤其在现实条件下表现突出。

Abstract: Stereo Depth Estimation (SDE) is essential for scene understanding in
vision-based systems like autonomous driving. However, recent studies show that
SDE models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which are often limited to
unrealistic settings, e.g., digital perturbations on separate stereo views in
static scenes, restricting their real-world applicability. This raises a
critical question: how can we design physically realizable, scene-adaptive, and
transferable attacks against SDE under realistic constraints?
  To answer this, we make two key contributions. First, we propose a unified
attack framework that extends optimization-based techniques to four core stages
of stereo matching: feature extraction, cost-volume construction, cost
aggregation, and disparity regression. A comprehensive stage-wise evaluation
across 9 mainstream SDE models, under constraints like photometric consistency,
reveals that optimization-based patches suffer from poor transferability.
Interestingly, partially transferable patches suggest that patterns, rather
than pixel-level perturbations, may be key to generalizable attacks. Motivated
by this, we present PatchHunter, the first optimization-free adversarial patch
attack against SDE. PatchHunter formulates patch generation as a reinforcement
learning-driven search over a structured space of visual patterns crafted to
disrupt SDE assumptions.
  We validate PatchHunter across three levels: the KITTI dataset, the CARLA
simulator, and real-world vehicle deployment. PatchHunter not only surpasses
optimization-based methods in effectiveness but also achieves significantly
better black-box transferability. Even under challenging physical conditions
like low light, PatchHunter maintains high attack success (e.g., D1-all > 0.4),
whereas optimization-based methods fail.

Motivation: 传统OOD检测方法需要大量IID样本训练，限制了实际应用。少样本OOD检测更具挑战性，且现有方法忽略了类间多样性。

Method: 提出AMCN网络，通过自适应提示（可学习的ID提示和固定/自适应的OOD提示）和类间阈值生成自适应边界，并设计提示引导的ID-OOD分离模块。

Result: 实验证明AMCN在少样本OOD检测中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AMCN通过结合文本与图像信息，有效解决了少样本OOD检测问题，为实际应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection attempts to distinguish outlier samples
to prevent models trained on the in-distribution (ID) dataset from producing
unavailable outputs. Most OOD detection methods require many IID samples for
training, which seriously limits their real-world applications. To this end, we
target a challenging setting: few-shot OOD detection, where {Only a few {\em
labeled ID} samples are available.} Therefore, few-shot OOD detection is much
more challenging than the traditional OOD detection setting. Previous few-shot
OOD detection works ignore the distinct diversity between different classes. In
this paper, we propose a novel network: Adaptive Multi-prompt Contrastive
Network (AMCN), which adapts the ID-OOD separation boundary by learning inter-
and intra-class distribution. To compensate for the absence of OOD and scarcity
of ID {\em image samples}, we leverage CLIP, connecting text with images,
engineering learnable ID and OOD {\em textual prompts}. Specifically, we first
generate adaptive prompts (learnable ID prompts, label-fixed OOD prompts and
label-adaptive OOD prompts). Then, we generate an adaptive class boundary for
each class by introducing a class-wise threshold. Finally, we propose a
prompt-guided ID-OOD separation module to control the margin between ID and OOD
prompts. Experimental results show that AMCN outperforms other state-of-the-art
works.

Abstract: Automating medical report generation from histopathology images is a critical
challenge requiring effective visual representations and domain-specific

from the training set with a multimodal in-context learning (ICL) mechanism.
Our method dynamically retrieves semantically similar whole slide image

relevance and generation quality. Evaluated on the HistGen benchmark, the
framework achieves state-of-the-art results, with significant improvements
across BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE-L metrics, and demonstrates robustness across
diverse report lengths and disease categories. By maximizing training data
utility and bridging vision and language with ICL, our work offers a solution
for AI-driven histopathology reporting, setting a strong foundation for future
advancements in multimodal clinical applications.

Abstract: Hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) often stem from the

peaks observed when generating both real and hallucinated entities. To address
this, we propose Memory-Driven Sparse Attention Matrix (MDSAM) , a novel
training-free approach that dynamically captures and refines the attention
allocated to image tokens at each layer. MDSAM memorizes attention patterns and
activates updates through alignment during decoding, enhancing focus on
relevant image tokens while effectively reducing hallucinations. We evaluate
MDSAM on multiple benchmarks for tasks such as image captioning and visual
question answering, demonstrating its ability to consistently reduce
hallucinations and improve reliability. Compatible with various LVLM
architectures, MDSAM highlights its adaptability and effectiveness in
mitigating hallucinations without requiring additional training or external
tools.

Result: CSDN显著提升了检测精度，仅需少量微调即可适配不同尺寸和结构的物体。

Conclusion: CSDN为CNN检测器提供了一种高效且灵活的头部替换方案，避免了大规模重新训练的需求。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have long been the cornerstone of target
detection, but they are often limited by limited receptive fields, which
hinders their ability to capture global contextual information. This paper
believes that the effective utilization of extracted features is as important
as the feature extraction process itself. We critically re-evaluated the
DETR-inspired header network architecture, questioning the indispensable nature
of its self-attention mechanism, and discovering significant information
redundancies. To solve these problems, we introduced the Context-Gated
Scale-Adaptive Detection Network (CSDN), a Transformer-based detection header
inspired by natural language processing architecture and human visual
perception. CSDN aims to efficiently utilize the characteristics of the CNN
backbone network by replacing the traditional stacked self-attention and
cross-attention layers with a novel gating mechanism. This mechanism enables
each region of interest (ROI) to adaptively select and combine feature
dimensions and scale information from multiple attention patterns. CSDN
provides more powerful global context modeling capabilities and can better
adapt to objects of different sizes and structures. Our proposed detection head
can directly replace the native heads of various CNN-based detectors, and only
a few rounds of fine-tuning on the pre-training weights can significantly
improve the detection accuracy, thus avoiding the need to achieve small
improvements. Various layer modules undergo extensive re-training.

Motivation: 解决第一人称视角下动作识别模型在未见环境中性能下降的问题，利用动作序列的一致性用户意图提升泛化能力。

Method: 提出SeqDG方法，包含视觉-文本序列重构目标（SeqRec）和跨领域动作序列混合训练（SeqMix）。

Result: 在EPIC-KITCHENS-100上，跨领域动作识别相对平均提升2.4%；在EGTEA上，域内动作识别Top-1准确率提升0.6%。

Conclusion: SeqDG通过动作序列和跨领域训练有效提升了模型在未见环境中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Recognizing human activities from visual inputs, particularly through a
first-person viewpoint, is essential for enabling robots to replicate human
behavior. Egocentric vision, characterized by cameras worn by observers,
captures diverse changes in illumination, viewpoint, and environment. This
variability leads to a notable drop in the performance of Egocentric Action
Recognition models when tested in environments not seen during training. In
this paper, we tackle these challenges by proposing a domain generalization
approach for Egocentric Action Recognition. Our insight is that action
sequences often reflect consistent user intent across visual domains. By
leveraging action sequences, we aim to enhance the model's generalization
ability across unseen environments. Our proposed method, named SeqDG,
introduces a visual-text sequence reconstruction objective (SeqRec) that uses
contextual cues from both text and visual inputs to reconstruct the central
action of the sequence. Additionally, we enhance the model's robustness by
training it on mixed sequences of actions from different domains (SeqMix). We
validate SeqDG on the EGTEA and EPIC-KITCHENS-100 datasets. Results on
EPIC-KITCHENS-100, show that SeqDG leads to +2.4% relative average improvement
in cross-domain action recognition in unseen environments, and on EGTEA the
model achieved +0.6% Top-1 accuracy over SOTA in intra-domain action
recognition.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在无标注数据下表现优异，计算成本低于传统方法。

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架高效、鲁棒，适用于多模态输入，为说话人验证提供了新思路。

Abstract: Conventional audio-visual methods for speaker verification rely on large
amounts of labeled data and separate modality-specific architectures, which is
computationally expensive, limiting their scalability. To address these
problems, we propose a self-supervised learning framework based on contrastive
learning with asymmetric masking and masked data modeling to obtain robust
audiovisual feature representations. In particular, we employ a unified
framework for self-supervised audiovisual speaker verification using a single
shared backbone for audio and visual inputs, leveraging the versatility of
vision transformers. The proposed unified framework can handle audio, visual,
or audiovisual inputs using a single shared vision transformer backbone during
training and testing while being computationally efficient and robust to
missing modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive performance without labeled data while reducing computational costs
compared to traditional approaches.

TL;DR: DreamJourney提出了一种两阶段框架，利用视频扩散模型生成动态场景的长期视频，解决了现有方法在3D感知和动态对象运动方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法基于2D扩散模型，缺乏3D感知能力且无法处理动态对象运动，导致生成视频中出现扭曲和静态场景限制。

Method: 第一阶段：将输入图像转换为3D点云并渲染部分图像序列，利用视频扩散模型补全缺失区域并增强视觉一致性。第二阶段：通过多模态大语言模型生成描述对象运动的文本提示，并利用视频扩散模型动态化当前视图。两阶段循环执行以实现长期动态场景生成。

Result: 实验表明，DreamJourney在定量和定性上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DreamJourney通过结合3D感知和动态对象运动，实现了高质量的长期动态场景生成。

Abstract: Perpetual view generation aims to synthesize a long-term video corresponding
to an arbitrary camera trajectory solely from a single input image. Recent
methods commonly utilize a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to
synthesize new content of previously unseen regions along camera movement.
However, the underlying 2D diffusion model lacks 3D awareness and results in
distorted artifacts. Moreover, they are limited to generating views of static
3D scenes, neglecting to capture object movements within the dynamic 4D world.
To alleviate these issues, we present DreamJourney, a two-stage framework that
leverages the world simulation capacity of video diffusion models to trigger a
new perpetual scene view generation task with both camera movements and object
dynamics. Specifically, in stage I, DreamJourney first lifts the input image to
3D point cloud and renders a sequence of partial images from a specific camera
trajectory. A video diffusion model is then utilized as generative prior to
complete the missing regions and enhance visual coherence across the sequence,
producing a cross-view consistent video adheres to the 3D scene and camera
trajectory. Meanwhile, we introduce two simple yet effective strategies (early
stopping and view padding) to further stabilize the generation process and
improve visual quality. Next, in stage II, DreamJourney leverages a multimodal
large language model to produce a text prompt describing object movements in
current view, and uses video diffusion model to animate current view with
object movements. Stage I and II are repeated recurrently, enabling perpetual
dynamic scene view generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our DreamJourney over state-of-the-art methods both
quantitatively and qualitatively. Our project page:

Result: 实验证明Programmable-Room在生成和编辑3D房间网格方面具有灵活性和优越性。

Conclusion: Programmable-Room框架通过分解任务和统一支持，实现了高效的3D房间生成和编辑。

Abstract: We present Programmable-Room, a framework which interactively generates and
edits a 3D room mesh, given natural language instructions. For precise control
of a room's each attribute, we decompose the challenging task into simpler
steps such as creating plausible 3D coordinates for room meshes, generating
panorama images for the texture, constructing 3D meshes by integrating the
coordinates and panorama texture images, and arranging furniture. To support
the various decomposed tasks with a unified framework, we incorporate visual
programming (VP). VP is a method that utilizes a large language model (LLM) to
write a Python-like program which is an ordered list of necessary modules for
the various tasks given in natural language. We develop most of the modules.
Especially, for the texture generating module, we utilize a pretrained
large-scale diffusion model to generate panorama images conditioned on text and
visual prompts (i.e., layout, depth, and semantic map) simultaneously.
Specifically, we enhance the panorama image generation quality by optimizing
the training objective with a 1D representation of a panorama scene obtained
from bidirectional LSTM. We demonstrate Programmable-Room's flexibility in
generating and editing 3D room meshes, and prove our framework's superiority to
an existing model quantitatively and qualitatively. Project page is available

Motivation: 盆腔放射损伤（PRI）的精确分割对预后评估和个性化治疗计划至关重要，但自动化分割因复杂器官形态和混淆背景而具有挑战性。

Method: 提出PDC-Net，包含多方向聚合模块（MDA）增强形状拟合能力，记忆引导上下文模块（MGC）提升全局模式区分，以及自适应融合解码器（AFD）动态选择特征。

Result: 在首个大规模盆腔放射损伤数据集上评估，PDC-Net优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PDC-Net通过分而治之的策略有效解决了PRI分割中的挑战，为临床提供了更精确的工具。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of Pelvic Radiation Injury (PRI) from Magnetic
Resonance Images (MRI) is crucial for more precise prognosis assessment and the
development of personalized treatment plans. However, automated segmentation
remains challenging due to factors such as complex organ morphologies and
confusing context. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Pattern
Divide-and-Conquer Network (PDC-Net) for PRI segmentation. The core idea is to
use different network modules to "divide" various local and global patterns
and, through flexible feature selection, to "conquer" the Regions of Interest
(ROI) during the decoding phase. Specifically, considering that our ROI often
manifests as strip-like or circular-like structures in MR slices, we introduce
a Multi-Direction Aggregation (MDA) module. This module enhances the model's
ability to fit the shape of the organ by applying strip convolutions in four
distinct directions. Additionally, to mitigate the challenge of confusing
context, we propose a Memory-Guided Context (MGC) module. This module
explicitly maintains a memory parameter to track cross-image patterns at the
dataset level, thereby enhancing the distinction between global patterns
associated with the positive and negative classes. Finally, we design an
Adaptive Fusion Decoder (AFD) that dynamically selects features from different
patterns based on the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework, ultimately generating
the final segmentation results. We evaluate our method on the first large-scale
pelvic radiation injury dataset, and the results demonstrate the superiority of
our PDC-Net over existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: YOLO系列模型在实时目标检测中表现优异，但缺乏全局高阶相关性建模能力，限制了复杂场景下的检测性能。

Method: 提出HyperACE机制和FullPAD范式，结合深度可分离卷积，减少参数和计算复杂度。

Result: 在MS COCO基准测试中，YOLOv13-N的mAP比YOLO11-N和YOLOv12-N分别提高了3.0%和1.5%。

Conclusion: YOLOv13在保持轻量化的同时，实现了更高的检测精度，为复杂场景下的目标检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The YOLO series models reign supreme in real-time object detection due to
their superior accuracy and computational efficiency. However, both the
convolutional architectures of YOLO11 and earlier versions and the area-based
self-attention mechanism introduced in YOLOv12 are limited to local information
aggregation and pairwise correlation modeling, lacking the capability to
capture global multi-to-multi high-order correlations, which limits detection
performance in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose YOLOv13, an
accurate and lightweight object detector. To address the above-mentioned
challenges, we propose a Hypergraph-based Adaptive Correlation Enhancement
(HyperACE) mechanism that adaptively exploits latent high-order correlations
and overcomes the limitation of previous methods that are restricted to
pairwise correlation modeling based on hypergraph computation, achieving
efficient global cross-location and cross-scale feature fusion and enhancement.
Subsequently, we propose a Full-Pipeline Aggregation-and-Distribution (FullPAD)
paradigm based on HyperACE, which effectively achieves fine-grained information
flow and representation synergy within the entire network by distributing
correlation-enhanced features to the full pipeline. Finally, we propose to
leverage depthwise separable convolutions to replace vanilla large-kernel
convolutions, and design a series of blocks that significantly reduce
parameters and computational complexity without sacrificing performance. We
conduct extensive experiments on the widely used MS COCO benchmark, and the
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance with fewer parameters and FLOPs. Specifically, our YOLOv13-N
improves mAP by 3.0\% over YOLO11-N and by 1.5\% over YOLOv12-N. The code and

Abstract: Transforming static images into interactive experiences remains a challenging
task in computer vision. Tackling this challenge holds the potential to elevate
mobile user experiences, notably through interactive and AR/VR applications.
Current approaches aim to achieve this either using pre-recorded video
responses or requiring multi-view images as input. In this paper, we present
PhysID, that streamlines the creation of physics-based interactive dynamics
from a single-view image by leveraging large generative models for 3D mesh
generation and physical property prediction. This significantly reduces the
expertise required for engineering-intensive tasks like 3D modeling and
intrinsic property calibration, enabling the process to be scaled with minimal
manual intervention. We integrate an on-device physics-based engine for
physically plausible real-time rendering with user interactions. PhysID
represents a leap forward in mobile-based interactive dynamics, offering
real-time, non-deterministic interactions and user-personalization with
efficient on-device memory consumption. Experiments evaluate the zero-shot
capabilities of various Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on diverse
tasks and the performance of 3D reconstruction models. These results
demonstrate the cohesive functioning of all modules within the end-to-end
framework, contributing to its effectiveness.

Conclusion: LoLA-SpecViT为农业、环境监测等实际应用提供了可扩展且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image classification remains a challenging task due to the high
dimensionality of spectral data, significant inter-band redundancy, and the
limited availability of annotated samples. While recent transformer-based
models have improved the global modeling of spectral-spatial dependencies,
their scalability and adaptability under label-scarce conditions remain
limited. In this work, we propose \textbf{LoLA-SpecViT}(Low-rank adaptation
Local Attention Spectral Vision Transformer), a lightweight spectral vision
transformer that addresses these limitations through a parameter-efficient
architecture tailored to the unique characteristics of hyperspectral imagery.
Our model combines a 3D convolutional spectral front-end with local
window-based self-attention, enhancing both spectral feature extraction and
spatial consistency while reducing computational complexity. To further improve
adaptability, we integrate low-rank adaptation (LoRA) into attention and
projection layers, enabling fine-tuning with over 80\% fewer trainable
parameters. A novel cyclical learning rate scheduler modulates LoRA adaptation
strength during training, improving convergence and generalisation. Extensive
experiments on three benchmark datasets WHU-Hi LongKou, WHU-Hi HongHu, and
Salinas demonstrate that LoLA-SpecViT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, achieving up to 99.91\% accuracy with substantially fewer parameters
and enhanced robustness under low-label regimes. The proposed framework
provides a scalable and generalizable solution for real-world HSI applications
in agriculture, environmental monitoring, and remote sensing analytics. Our

Method: 提出FairMoE框架，采用分层混合专家模块动态路由数据，适应组边界情况。

Result: 实验显示FairMoE在保持公平性的同时显著提高准确性。

Conclusion: FairMoE为AI医疗诊断中的公平性问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: AI-based systems have achieved high accuracy in skin disease diagnostics but
often exhibit biases across demographic groups, leading to inequitable
healthcare outcomes and diminished patient trust. Most existing bias mitigation
methods attempt to eliminate the correlation between sensitive attributes and
diagnostic prediction, but those methods often degrade performance due to the
lost of clinically relevant diagnostic cues. In this work, we propose an
alternative approach that incorporates sensitive attributes to achieve
fairness. We introduce FairMoE, a framework that employs layer-wise
mixture-of-experts modules to serve as group-specific learners. Unlike
traditional methods that rigidly assign data based on group labels, FairMoE
dynamically routes data to the most suitable expert, making it particularly
effective for handling cases near group boundaries. Experimental results show
that, unlike previous fairness approaches that reduce performance, FairMoE
achieves substantial accuracy improvements while preserving comparable fairness
metrics.

Motivation: 主流ICL方法依赖网格化策略，缺乏视觉应用所需的灵活性，限制了上下文图像的数量和分辨率。

Method: 提出Temporal方法，通过时间对比自监督目标预训练提示检索器，将ICL任务重新定义为VOS任务，支持可变数量的上下文图像并保持其完整分辨率。

Result: 在MICCAI FLARE 2022上，图像分割Dice分数提升10.64%（90.95%），视频分割提升14.88%（92.45%）。

Conclusion: Temporal方法通过重新定义ICL为VOS任务，解决了网格化方法的局限性，显著提升了分割性能。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables generalization to new tasks with minimal
labeled data. However, mainstream ICL approaches rely on a gridding strategy,
which lacks the flexibility required for vision applications. We introduce
Temporal, a time-contrastive self-supervised objective that pretrains a prompt
retriever for visual ICL, and formulate ICL as a video object segmentation
(VOS) task. Temporal addresses key limitations of grid-based methods that
restrict the number and resolution of context images. By reframing ICL as a VOS
problem, our approach supports a variable number of context images while
preserving their full resolution. To address the challenge of selecting optimal
context sets for queries, we pretrain a prompt retriever on videos via
self-supervised learning, where adjacent frames serve as positives and distant
frames as negatives. For image segmentation, the prompt retriever selects
relevant sequences that, when combined with the query, form coherent videos for
VOS processing. For video segmentation, it identifies keyframes, predicts their
masks using our ICL pipeline, and propagates them throughout the sequence. When
evaluated on MICCAI FLARE 2022, our method achieves substantial improvements
over baselines: 90.95% Dice score for image segmentation (10.64% improvement)
and 92.45% Dice for video segmentation (14.88% improvement).

Abstract: This paper proposes a foreground-background separation (FBS) method with a
novel foreground model based on convolutional sparse representation (CSR). In
order to analyze the dynamic and static components of videos acquired under
undesirable conditions, such as hardware, environmental, and power limitations,
it is essential to establish an FBS method that can handle videos with low
frame rates and various types of noise. Existing FBS methods have two
limitations that prevent us from accurately separating foreground and
background components from such degraded videos. First, they only capture
either data-specific or general features of the components. Second, they do not
include explicit models for various types of noise to remove them in the FBS
process. To this end, we propose a robust FBS method with a CSR-based
foreground model. This model can adaptively capture specific spatial structures
scattered in imaging data. Then, we formulate FBS as a constrained multiconvex
optimization problem that incorporates CSR, functions that capture general
features, and explicit noise characterization functions for multiple types of
noise. Thanks to these functions, our method captures both data-specific and
general features to accurately separate the components from various types of
noise even under low frame rates. To obtain a solution of the optimization
problem, we develop an algorithm that alternately solves its two convex
subproblems by newly established algorithms. Experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our method over existing methods using two types of degraded
videos: infrared and microscope videos.

Abstract: Analyzing fetal body motion and shape is paramount in prenatal diagnostics
and monitoring. Existing methods for fetal MRI analysis mainly rely on
anatomical keypoints or volumetric body segmentations. Keypoints simplify body
structure to facilitate motion analysis, but may ignore important details of
full-body shape. Body segmentations capture complete shape information but
complicate temporal analysis due to large non-local fetal movements. To address
these limitations, we construct a 3D articulated statistical fetal body model
based on the Skinned Multi-Person Linear Model (SMPL). Our algorithm
iteratively estimates body pose in the image space and body shape in the
canonical pose space. This approach improves robustness to MRI motion artifacts
and intensity distortions, and reduces the impact of incomplete surface
observations due to challenging fetal poses. We train our model on
segmentations and keypoints derived from $19,816$ MRI volumes across $53$
subjects. Our model captures body shape and motion across time series and
provides intuitive visualization. Furthermore, it enables automated
anthropometric measurements traditionally difficult to obtain from
segmentations and keypoints. When tested on unseen fetal body shapes, our
method yields a surface alignment error of $3.2$ mm for $3$ mm MRI voxel size.
To our knowledge, this represents the first 3D articulated statistical fetal
body model, paving the way for enhanced fetal motion and shape analysis in
prenatal diagnostics. The code is available at

Motivation: 在野外环境中，RGB和热数据的融合能显著提升语义分割性能，但现有方法（如基于Transformer的方法）计算开销大，难以在资源受限系统中应用。

Method: 提出CM-SSM架构，包含跨模态2D选择性扫描（CM-SS2D）模块和跨模态状态空间关联（CM-SSA）模块，分别建立跨模态状态空间模型和整合全局与局部特征。

Result: 在CART数据集上达到最先进性能，参数更少且计算成本更低；在PST900数据集上验证了泛化能力。

Conclusion: CM-SSM通过线性计算复杂度解决了多源数据融合的计算挑战，同时保持了高性能。

Abstract: The integration of RGB and thermal data can significantly improve semantic
segmentation performance in wild environments for field robots. Nevertheless,
multi-source data processing (e.g. Transformer-based approaches) imposes
significant computational overhead, presenting challenges for
resource-constrained systems. To resolve this critical limitation, we
introduced CM-SSM, an efficient RGB-thermal semantic segmentation architecture
leveraging a cross-modal state space modeling (SSM) approach. Our framework
comprises two key components. First, we introduced a cross-modal
2D-selective-scan (CM-SS2D) module to establish SSM between RGB and thermal
modalities, which constructs cross-modal visual sequences and derives hidden
state representations of one modality from the other. Second, we developed a
cross-modal state space association (CM-SSA) module that effectively integrates
global associations from CM-SS2D with local spatial features extracted through
convolutional operations. In contrast with Transformer-based approaches, CM-SSM

Experimental results show that CM-SSM achieves state-of-the-art performance on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型（Vid-LLMs）缺乏针对手术视频细粒度理解的专业化能力，限制了手术场景的深入分析。

Method: 提出SurgVidLM模型，构建SVU-31K数据集，引入StageFocus机制和Multi-frequency Fusion Attention技术。

Result: SurgVidLM在全貌和细粒度视频理解任务中显著优于现有Vid-LLMs。

Conclusion: SurgVidLM填补了手术视频细粒度理解的空白，为复杂手术场景分析提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models have demonstrated great
potential in the medical domain, facilitating users to understand surgical
scenes and procedures. Beyond image-based methods, the exploration of Video
Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) has emerged as a promising avenue for
capturing the complex sequences of information involved in surgery. However,
there is still a lack of Vid-LLMs specialized for fine-grained surgical video
understanding tasks, which is crucial for analyzing specific processes or
details within a surgical procedure. To bridge this gap, we propose SurgVidLM,
the first video language model designed to address both full and fine-grained
surgical video comprehension. To train our SurgVidLM, we construct the SVU-31K
dataset which consists of over 31K video-instruction pairs, enabling both
holistic understanding and detailed analysis of surgical procedures.
Furthermore, we introduce the StageFocus mechanism which is a two-stage
framework performing the multi-grained, progressive understanding of surgical
videos. We also develop the Multi-frequency Fusion Attention to effectively
integrate low and high-frequency visual tokens, ensuring the retention of
critical information. Experimental results demonstrate that SurgVidLM
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art Vid-LLMs in both full and
fine-grained video understanding tasks, showcasing its superior capability in
capturing complex procedural contexts.

<details>

Motivation: 病理图像的颜色差异可能影响计算机辅助诊断系统的性能，因此需要一种有效的染色归一化方法。

Method: 解耦图像为结构特征和向量量化颜色特征，利用固定颜色向量代码本和交叉注意力机制重新染色，并设计模板图像选择算法。

Result: 实验验证了StainPIDR和模板选择算法的有效性，表明该方法在染色归一化任务中表现良好。

Conclusion: StainPIDR能有效解决病理图像颜色差异问题，代码将公开。

Abstract: The color appearance of a pathological image is highly related to the imaging
protocols, the proportion of different dyes, and the scanning devices.
Computer-aided diagnostic systems may deteriorate when facing these
color-variant pathological images. In this work, we propose a stain
normalization method called StainPIDR. We try to eliminate this color
discrepancy by decoupling the image into structure features and
vector-quantized color features, restaining the structure features with the
target color features, and decoding the stained structure features to
normalized pathological images. We assume that color features decoupled by
different images with the same color should be exactly the same. Under this
assumption, we train a fixed color vector codebook to which the decoupled color
features will map. In the restaining part, we utilize the cross-attention
mechanism to efficiently stain the structure features. As the target color
(decoupled from a selected template image) will also affect the performance of
stain normalization, we further design a template image selection algorithm to
select a template from a given dataset. In our extensive experiments, we
validate the effectiveness of StainPIDR and the template image selection
algorithm. All the results show that our method can perform well in the stain
normalization task. The code of StainPIDR will be publicly available later.

fusion mechanism to align complementary structural information from Synthetic
Aperture Radar (SAR) with spectral characteristics from optical data.
Furthermore, a cloud-aware model update strategy introduces adaptive loss

accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms

Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的3D实例分割方法主要关注场景特征与查询特征的外部关系，缺乏对场景特征内部及查询特征间关系的有效建模。

Method: 提出自适应超点聚合模块和对比学习引导的超点优化模块，增强超点特征表示；引入关系感知自注意力机制，结合位置和几何关系优化查询间关系建模。

Result: 在ScanNetV2、ScanNet++、ScanNet200和S3DIS数据集上表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: Relation3D通过改进关系建模，显著提升了3D实例分割的效果。

Abstract: 3D instance segmentation aims to predict a set of object instances in a
scene, representing them as binary foreground masks with corresponding semantic
labels. Currently, transformer-based methods are gaining increasing attention
due to their elegant pipelines and superior predictions. However, these methods
primarily focus on modeling the external relationships between scene features
and query features through mask attention. They lack effective modeling of the
internal relationships among scene features as well as between query features.
In light of these disadvantages, we propose \textbf{Relation3D: Enhancing
Relation Modeling for Point Cloud Instance Segmentation}. Specifically, we
introduce an adaptive superpoint aggregation module and a contrastive
learning-guided superpoint refinement module to better represent superpoint
features (scene features) and leverage contrastive learning to guide the
updates of these features. Furthermore, our relation-aware self-attention
mechanism enhances the capabilities of modeling relationships between queries
by incorporating positional and geometric relationships into the self-attention
mechanism. Extensive experiments on the ScanNetV2, ScanNet++, ScanNet200 and
S3DIS datasets demonstrate the superior performance of Relation3D.

Conclusion: 该研究填补了工业传送带裂缝数据集的空白，为机器学习在该领域的应用提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Conveyor belt is a category of important equipments in modern industry,
widely applied in production and manufacturing Fields. Its health status is
much critical to operation efficiency and safety hazards. Among the factors
affecting belt health, crack is often one of the most threatening risks.
Currently, considering safety, how to intelligently detect belt cracks is
catching an increasing attention. To implement the intelligent detection with
machine learning, real crack samples are believed to be necessary. However,
existing crack datasets primarily focus on pavement scenarios or synthetic
data, no real-world industrial belt crack datasets at all. To propel machine
learning advancement in this field, this paper constructs the first
sequential-image belt crack detection datasets (BeltCrack14ks and
BeltCrack9kd), from real-world factory scenes. Furthermore, to validate
usability and effectiveness, we propose a special baseline method with
triple-domain (i.e., time-space-frequency) feature hierarchical fusion learning
for the two whole-new datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the
availability and effectiveness of our dataset. Besides, they also show that our
baseline is obviously superior to other similar detection methods. Our datasets

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内中心视觉对AR、VR和机器人应用至关重要，但现有方法依赖2D线索和同步多视角设置，限制了其应用。

Method: EgoWorld通过外中心深度图重建点云，重投影到内中心视角，并利用扩散修复生成语义连贯的内中心图像。

Result: 在H2O和TACO数据集上表现优异，泛化能力强，适用于新对象、动作、场景和主体，甚至在未标记的真实数据上表现良好。

Conclusion: EgoWorld克服了现有方法的局限性，为内中心视觉重建提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Egocentric vision is essential for both human and machine visual
understanding, particularly in capturing the detailed hand-object interactions
needed for manipulation tasks. Translating third-person views into first-person
views significantly benefits augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and
robotics applications. However, current exocentric-to-egocentric translation
methods are limited by their dependence on 2D cues, synchronized multi-view
settings, and unrealistic assumptions such as necessity of initial egocentric
frame and relative camera poses during inference. To overcome these challenges,
we introduce EgoWorld, a novel two-stage framework that reconstructs an
egocentric view from rich exocentric observations, including projected point
clouds, 3D hand poses, and textual descriptions. Our approach reconstructs a
point cloud from estimated exocentric depth maps, reprojects it into the
egocentric perspective, and then applies diffusion-based inpainting to produce
dense, semantically coherent egocentric images. Evaluated on the H2O and TACO
datasets, EgoWorld achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates
robust generalization to new objects, actions, scenes, and subjects. Moreover,
EgoWorld shows promising results even on unlabeled real-world examples.

TL;DR: MMGrounded-PostAlign框架通过多模态对齐增强MLLMs的视觉理解能力，减少幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MLLMs因语言先验导致的虚假相关性和视觉信息利用不足的问题。

Method: 引入多模态基础模块（视觉和文本基础）和负拒绝机制，以及选择性推理机制。

Result: 在多个基准测试（POPE、HaloQuest等）中显著提升了细粒度视觉理解和幻觉抑制能力。

Conclusion: MMGrounded-PostAlign有效提升了MLLMs的视觉理解能力并减少了幻觉现象。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language tasks, such
as image captioning and visual question answering. However, they often suffer
from over-reliance on spurious correlations, primarily due to linguistic priors
that distract the model from leveraging actual visual information. To address
these issues, we introduce MMGrounded-PostAlign, a post-multimodal alignment
framework designed to enhance the visual understanding capabilities and
mitigate the hallucinations of MLLMs. Our framework incorporates a multimodal
grounding module for both visual grounding, which identifies the referred
object in the image, and textual grounding, which generates the rationale for
the final answer, ensuring that outputs are anchored in both visual and textual
evidence. To mitigate the hallucinations, we introduce a negative rejection
mechanism in the visual grounding module to distinguish grounded entities from
non-existent objects influenced by linguistic biases. On the textual grounding
side, we propose a selective reasoning mechanism that adjusts the model's
reasoning strategy based on query complexity. Extensive evaluations are
conducted on benchmarks such as POPE, HaloQuest, VQAv2, MME, and MMBench
showing significant improvements in fine-grained visual understanding and
hallucination suppression.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CEDO的新框架，通过三种机制（MHO、GMS、DLR）从因果和效应角度全面缓解医学视觉问答模型中的语言偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学视觉问答模型存在语言偏差问题，即问题类型与答案类别之间存在虚假关联。

Method: CEDO框架包含三种机制：MHO（模态驱动的异构优化）、GMS（梯度引导的模态协同）和DLR（分布适应的损失重缩放），分别从不同角度缓解语言偏差。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，CEDO表现出优于现有方法的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CEDO通过综合优化机制有效缓解了语言偏差，提升了模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Existing Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) models often suffer from
language biases, where spurious correlations between question types and answer
categories are inadvertently established. To address these issues, we propose a
novel Cause-Effect Driven Optimization framework called CEDO, that incorporates
three well-established mechanisms, i.e., Modality-driven Heterogeneous
Optimization (MHO), Gradient-guided Modality Synergy (GMS), and
Distribution-adapted Loss Rescaling (DLR), for comprehensively mitigating
language biases from both causal and effectual perspectives. Specifically, MHO
employs adaptive learning rates for specific modalities to achieve
heterogeneous optimization, thus enhancing robust reasoning capabilities.
Additionally, GMS leverages the Pareto optimization method to foster
synergistic interactions between modalities and enforce gradient orthogonality
to eliminate bias updates, thereby mitigating language biases from the effect
side, i.e., shortcut bias. Furthermore, DLR is designed to assign adaptive
weights to individual losses to ensure balanced learning across all answer
categories, effectively alleviating language biases from the cause side, i.e.,
imbalance biases within datasets. Extensive experiments on multiple traditional
and bias-sensitive benchmarks consistently demonstrate the robustness of CEDO
over state-of-the-art competitors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在自动驾驶运动规划中存在两大问题：过度依赖历史信息而忽视视觉输入的真实理解，以及推理过程与规划结果的不对齐。

Method: Drive-R1首先在包含长短推理数据的数据集上进行监督微调，随后通过强化学习框架优化推理路径，以提升规划效果。

Result: 在nuScenes和DriveLM-nuScenes基准测试中，Drive-R1表现优于现有最先进的视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: Drive-R1为自动驾驶中推理与规划的结合提供了新方向，具有未来研究和应用的方法学价值。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) for autonomous driving (AD) are evolving
beyond perception and cognition tasks toward motion planning. However, we
identify two critical challenges in this direction: (1) VLMs tend to learn
shortcuts by relying heavily on history input information, achieving seemingly
strong planning results without genuinely understanding the visual inputs; and
(2) the chain-ofthought (COT) reasoning processes are always misaligned with
the motion planning outcomes, and how to effectively leverage the complex
reasoning capability to enhance planning remains largely underexplored. In this
paper, we start from a small-scale domain-specific VLM and propose Drive-R1
designed to bridges the scenario reasoning and motion planning for AD. Drive-R1
first undergoes the supervised finetuning on a elaborate dataset containing
both long and short COT data. Drive-R1 is encouraged to reason step-by-step
from visual input to final planning decisions. Subsequently, Drive-R1 is
trained within a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes the
discovery of reasoning paths that are more informative for planning, guided by
rewards based on predicted trajectories and meta actions. Experimental
evaluations on the nuScenes and DriveLM-nuScenes benchmarks demonstrate that
Drive-R1 achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art
VLMs. We believe that Drive-R1 presents a promising direction for bridging
reasoning and planning in AD, offering methodological insights for future
research and applications.

Abstract: 2D cameras are often used in interactive systems. Other systems like gaming
consoles provide more powerful 3D cameras for short range depth sensing.
Overall, these cameras are not reliable in large, complex environments. In this
work, we propose a 3D stereo vision based pipeline for interactive systems,
that is able to handle both ordinary and sensitive applications, through robust
scene understanding. We explore the fusion of multiple 3D cameras to do full
scene reconstruction, which allows for preforming a wide range of tasks, like
event recognition, subject tracking, and notification. Using possible feedback
approaches, the system can receive data from the subjects present in the
environment, to learn to make better decisions, or to adapt to completely new
environments. Throughout the paper, we introduce the pipeline and explain our
preliminary experimentation and results. Finally, we draw the roadmap for the

Result: 在文本到运动基准测试中，FID分数提升63.8%，运动多样性增加49.9%，达到最新性能。

Conclusion: PlanMoGPT成功解决了多样性-质量的权衡问题，为文本到运动生成设定了新标准。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled breakthroughs in
many multimodal generation tasks, but a significant performance gap still
exists in text-to-motion generation, where LLM-based methods lag far behind
non-LLM methods. We identify the granularity of motion tokenization as a
critical bottleneck: fine-grained tokenization induces local dependency issues,
where LLMs overemphasize short-term coherence at the expense of global semantic
alignment, while coarse-grained tokenization sacrifices motion details. To
resolve this issue, we propose PlanMoGPT, an LLM-based framework integrating
progressive planning and flow-enhanced fine-grained motion tokenization. First,
our progressive planning mechanism leverages LLMs' autoregressive capabilities
to hierarchically generate motion tokens by starting from sparse global plans
and iteratively refining them into full sequences. Second, our flow-enhanced
tokenizer doubles the downsampling resolution and expands the codebook size by
eight times, minimizing detail loss during discretization, while a
flow-enhanced decoder recovers motion nuances. Extensive experiments on
text-to-motion benchmarks demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art
performance, improving FID scores by 63.8% (from 0.380 to 0.141) on
long-sequence generation while enhancing motion diversity by 49.9% compared to
existing methods. The proposed framework successfully resolves the
diversity-quality trade-off that plagues current non-LLM approaches,
establishing new standards for text-to-motion generation.

Conclusion: 该框架在多智能体协作SLAM中表现出色，数据集和代码开源将推动SLAM和3D重建领域的发展。

Abstract: Neural implicit scene representations have recently shown promising results
in dense visual SLAM. However, existing implicit SLAM algorithms are
constrained to single-agent scenarios, and fall difficulties in large-scale
scenes and long sequences. Existing NeRF-based multi-agent SLAM frameworks
cannot meet the constraints of communication bandwidth. To this end, we propose
the first distributed multi-agent collaborative neural SLAM framework with
hybrid scene representation, distributed camera tracking, intra-to-inter loop
closure, and online distillation for multiple submap fusion. A novel
triplane-grid joint scene representation method is proposed to improve scene
reconstruction. A novel intra-to-inter loop closure method is designed to
achieve local (single-agent) and global (multi-agent) consistency. We also
design a novel online distillation method to fuse the information of different
submaps to achieve global consistency. Furthermore, to the best of our
knowledge, there is no real-world dataset for NeRF-based/GS-based SLAM that
provides both continuous-time trajectories groundtruth and high-accuracy 3D
meshes groundtruth. To this end, we propose the first real-world Dense slam
(DES) dataset covering both single-agent and multi-agent scenarios, ranging
from small rooms to large-scale outdoor scenes, with high-accuracy ground truth
for both 3D mesh and continuous-time camera trajectory. This dataset can
advance the development of the research in both SLAM, 3D reconstruction, and
visual foundation model. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method in both mapping, tracking, and
communication. The dataset and code will open-source on

Conclusion: 提出的UDA方法在多模态分布对齐和训练效率上表现优异，适用于自然图像的复杂域自适应任务。

Abstract: We present a novel approach for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for
natural images. A commonly-used objective for UDA schemes is to enhance domain
alignment in representation space even if there is a domain shift in the input
space. Existing adversarial domain adaptation methods may not effectively align
different domains of multimodal distributions associated with classification
problems. Our approach has two main features. Firstly, its neural architecture
uses the deep structure of ResNet and the effective separation of scales of
feature pyramidal network (FPN) to work with both content and style features.
Secondly, it uses a combination of a novel loss function and judiciously
selected existing loss functions to train the network architecture. This
tailored combination is designed to address challenges inherent to natural
images, such as scale, noise, and style shifts, that occur on top of a
multi-modal (multi-class) distribution. The combined loss function not only
enhances model accuracy and robustness on the target domain but also speeds up
training convergence. Our proposed UDA scheme generalizes better than
state-of-the-art for CNN-based methods on Office-Home, Office-31, and
VisDA-2017 datasets and comaparable for DomainNet dataset.

Abstract: Effective human action recognition is widely used for cobots in Industry 4.0
to assist in assembly tasks. However, conventional skeleton-based methods often
lose keypoint semantics, limiting their effectiveness in complex interactions.
In this work, we introduce a novel approach to skeleton-based action
recognition that enriches input representations by leveraging word embeddings
to encode semantic information. Our method replaces one-hot encodings with
semantic volumes, enabling the model to capture meaningful relationships
between joints and objects. Through extensive experiments on multiple assembly
datasets, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves
classification performance, and enhances generalization capabilities by
simultaneously supporting different skeleton types and object classes. Our
findings highlight the potential of incorporating semantic information to
enhance skeleton-based action recognition in dynamic and diverse environments.

Abstract: Medical visual question answering aims to support clinical decision-making by
enabling models to answer natural language questions based on medical images.
While recent advances in multi-modal learning have significantly improved
performance, current methods still suffer from limited answer reliability and
poor interpretability, impairing the ability of clinicians and patients to
understand and trust model-generated answers. To address this, this work first
proposes a Thinking with Visual Grounding (ThinkVG) dataset wherein the answer
generation is decomposed into intermediate reasoning steps that explicitly
ground relevant visual regions of the medical image, thereby providing
fine-grained explainability. Furthermore, we introduce a novel verifiable
reward mechanism for reinforcement learning to guide post-training, improving
the alignment between the model's reasoning process and its final answer.
Remarkably, our method achieves comparable performance using only one-eighth of
the training data, demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness of the
proposal. The dataset is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的增强推理方法（SegChange-R1），通过整合文本描述信息提升变化检测能力，并设计了基于线性注意力的空间变换模块（BEV）解决模态对齐问题。


<details>

Motivation: 提升遥感变化检测的精度和效率，特别是在建筑变化检测中，通过引入文本描述和统一多时相特征的空间对齐。

Method: 结合LLM增强推理和BEV空间变换模块，构建了首个无人机视角的建筑变化检测数据集（DVCD）。

Result: 在四个常用变化检测数据集上表现显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SegChange-R1通过文本引导和空间对齐，有效提升了变化检测的性能和收敛速度。

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection is widely used in a variety of fields such as
urban planning, terrain and geomorphology analysis, and environmental
monitoring, mainly by analyzing the significant change differences of features
(e.g., building changes) in the same spatial region at different time phases.
In this paper, we propose a large language model (LLM) augmented inference
approach (SegChange-R1), which enhances the detection capability by integrating
textual descriptive information and aims at guiding the model to segment the
more interested change regions, thus accelerating the convergence speed.
Moreover, we design a spatial transformation module (BEV) based on linear
attention, which solves the problem of modal misalignment in change detection
by unifying features from different temporal perspectives onto the BEV space.
In addition, we construct the first dataset for building change detection from
UAV viewpoints (DVCD ), and our experiments on four widely-used change
detection datasets show a significant improvement over existing methods. The
code and pre-trained models are available in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的深度学习模型，用于分类街头集市中的帐篷，比较了自定义CNN和EfficientNetB0的性能，结果显示EfficientNetB0在分类任务中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 街头集市是许多地区的重要经济中心，但其非结构化特性使得帐篷等基础设施的自动分类成为挑战。手动分类效率低下，而CNN在此类任务中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 研究使用了126张原始照片，并通过数据增强生成更多图像。比较了自定义CNN和EfficientNetB0的性能，使用了多种评估指标（如准确率、精确率、召回率、F1分数和mAP）。

Result: 自定义CNN的准确率为92.8%，而EfficientNetB0达到98.4%，表明迁移学习在分类任务中更有效。

Conclusion: 预训练模型（如EfficientNetB0）显著提高了分类准确率和泛化能力，适用于街头集市的帐篷分类任务。

Abstract: This research paper proposes an improved deep learning model for classifying
tents in street bazaars, comparing a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
with EfficientNetB0. This is a critical task for market organization with a
tent classification, but manual methods in the past have been inefficient.
Street bazaars represent a vital economic hub in many regions, yet their
unstructured nature poses significant challenges for the automated
classification of market infrastructure, such as tents. In Kyrgyzstan, more
than a quarter of the country's GDP is derived from bazaars. While CNNs have
been widely applied to object recognition, their application to bazaar-specific
tasks remains underexplored. Here, we build upon our original approach by
training on an extended set of 126 original photographs that were augmented to
generate additional images. This dataset is publicly available for download on
Kaggle. A variety of performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall,
F1 score, and mean average precision (mAP), were used to assess the models
comparatively, providing a more extensive analysis of classification
performance.
  The results show that the CNN custom model achieved 92.8% accuracy, and
EfficientNetB0 showed 98.4% accuracy results, confirming the effectiveness of
transfer learning in the bazaar image classification. Also, when analyzing the
confusion matrix, the analysis reveals the weaknesses and strengths of each
model. These findings suggest that using a pre-trained model such as
EfficientNetB0 significantly improves classification accuracy and
generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为空间感知窗口注意力（SWA）的新机制，用于改进语义占用预测（SOP）任务，解决了现有方法在稀疏或遮挡区域性能不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶中的感知系统常因遮挡和数据稀疏性无法获取完整信息，现有基于Transformer的SOP方法缺乏对空间结构的显式建模，导致几何感知能力有限。

Method: 提出SWA机制，将局部空间上下文信息融入注意力计算中，从而增强几何感知能力。

Result: SWA显著提升了场景补全效果，在LiDAR和相机两种模态的SOP任务中均取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SWA通过显式建模空间结构，有效提升了SOP任务在稀疏和遮挡区域的性能，具有跨模态的通用性。

Abstract: Perception systems in autonomous driving rely on sensors such as LiDAR and
cameras to perceive the 3D environment. However, due to occlusions and data
sparsity, these sensors often fail to capture complete information. Semantic
Occupancy Prediction (SOP) addresses this challenge by inferring both occupancy
and semantics of unobserved regions. Existing transformer-based SOP methods
lack explicit modeling of spatial structure in attention computation, resulting
in limited geometric awareness and poor performance in sparse or occluded
areas. To this end, we propose Spatially-aware Window Attention (SWA), a novel
mechanism that incorporates local spatial context into attention. SWA
significantly improves scene completion and achieves state-of-the-art results
on LiDAR-based SOP benchmarks. We further validate its generality by
integrating SWA into a camera-based SOP pipeline, where it also yields
consistent gains across modalities.

Conclusion: 该应用为结核病管理提供了高效解决方案，未来将优化算法并扩展功能。

Abstract: This paper presents a newly developed mobile application designed to diagnose
Latent Tuberculosis Infection (LTBI) using the Mantoux Skin Test (TST).
Traditional TST methods often suffer from low follow-up return rates, patient
discomfort, and subjective manual interpretation, particularly with the
ball-point pen method, leading to misdiagnosis and delayed treatment. Moreover,
previous developed mobile applications that used 3D reconstruction, this app
utilizes scaling stickers as reference objects for induration measurement. This
mobile application integrates advanced image processing technologies, including
ARCore, and machine learning algorithms such as DeepLabv3 for robust image
segmentation and precise measurement of skin indurations indicative of LTBI.
The system employs an edge detection algorithm to enhance accuracy. The
application was evaluated against standard clinical practices, demonstrating
significant improvements in accuracy and reliability. This innovation is
crucial for effective tuberculosis management, especially in resource-limited
regions. By automating and standardizing TST evaluations, the application
enhances the accessibility and efficiency of TB di-agnostics. Future work will
focus on refining machine learning models, optimizing measurement algorithms,
expanding functionalities to include comprehensive patient data management, and
enhancing ARCore's performance across various lighting conditions and
operational settings.

Motivation: 自动驾驶感知因环境中的遮挡和不完整场景数据面临挑战，传统相机方法对所有类别平等处理且依赖局部特征，导致前景对象预测效果不佳。

Method: 提出OC-SOP框架，将检测分支提取的对象中心线索集成到语义占用预测流程中。

Result: 显著提高了前景对象的预测准确性，并在SemanticKITTI上实现了所有类别的最佳性能。

Conclusion: OC-SOP通过对象中心的方法有效解决了传统方法的局限性，提升了自动驾驶感知的性能。

Abstract: Autonomous driving perception faces significant challenges due to occlusions
and incomplete scene data in the environment. To overcome these issues, the
task of semantic occupancy prediction (SOP) is proposed, which aims to jointly
infer both the geometry and semantic labels of a scene from images. However,
conventional camera-based methods typically treat all categories equally and
primarily rely on local features, leading to suboptimal predictions, especially
for dynamic foreground objects. To address this, we propose Object-Centric SOP
(OC-SOP), a framework that integrates high-level object-centric cues extracted
via a detection branch into the semantic occupancy prediction pipeline. This
object-centric integration significantly enhances the prediction accuracy for
foreground objects and achieves state-of-the-art performance among all
categories on SemanticKITTI.

Motivation: LiDAR和4D雷达在自动驾驶中各有优势，但多模态融合中的对齐问题常被忽视。本文旨在结合两者的优势，提升感知性能。

Method: 通过动态运动感知编码模块提取4D雷达的运动信息，并利用实例级不确定性估计减少跨模态对齐误差，优化LiDAR检测结果。

Result: 在VoD数据集上，整个区域的mAP达到74.89%，驾驶走廊内达到88.70%，实时推理速度为30.02 FPS。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多模态融合中的对齐问题，显著提升了检测性能，同时保持了实时性。

Abstract: LiDAR and 4D radar are widely used in autonomous driving and robotics. While
LiDAR provides rich spatial information, 4D radar offers velocity measurement
and remains robust under adverse conditions. As a result, increasing studies
have focused on the 4D radar-LiDAR fusion method to enhance the perception.
However, the misalignment between different modalities is often overlooked. To
address this challenge and leverage the strengths of both modalities, we
propose a LiDAR detection framework enhanced by 4D radar motion status and
cross-modal uncertainty. The object movement information from 4D radar is first
captured using a Dynamic Motion-Aware Encoding module during feature extraction
to enhance 4D radar predictions. Subsequently, the instance-wise uncertainties
of bounding boxes are estimated to mitigate the cross-modal misalignment and
refine the final LiDAR predictions. Extensive experiments on the View-of-Delft
(VoD) dataset highlight the effectiveness of our method, achieving
state-of-the-art performance with the mAP of 74.89% in the entire area and
88.70% within the driving corridor while maintaining a real-time inference
speed of 30.02 FPS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常通过线性融合多尺度特征来评估图像质量，但未能充分捕捉失真对语义内容的影响。

Method: 利用CLIP模型提取多尺度特征，并引入自底向上的多尺度交叉注意力模块，结合40个图像质量形容词增强文本编码器。

Result: 在大多数公共FR和NR IQA基准测试中表现优异，且具有更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: BPCLIP方法通过结合CLIP和自底向上的特征提取，显著提升了图像质量评估的性能。

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) aims to evaluate the perceptual quality of
images based on human subjective perception. Existing methods generally combine
multiscale features to achieve high performance, but most rely on
straightforward linear fusion of these features, which may not adequately
capture the impact of distortions on semantic content. To address this, we
propose a bottom-up image quality assessment approach based on the Contrastive
Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP, a recently proposed model that aligns images
and text in a shared feature space), named BPCLIP, which progressively extracts
the impact of low-level distortions on high-level semantics. Specifically, we
utilize an encoder to extract multiscale features from the input image and
introduce a bottom-up multiscale cross attention module designed to capture the
relationships between shallow and deep features. In addition, by incorporating
40 image quality adjectives across six distinct dimensions, we enable the
pre-trained CLIP text encoder to generate representations of the intrinsic
quality of the image, thereby strengthening the connection between image
quality perception and human language. Our method achieves superior results on
most public Full-Reference (FR) and No-Reference (NR) IQA benchmarks, while
demonstrating greater robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成数据在医学影像中隐私保护潜力大，但法律问题和性能不足限制了其应用。

Method: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的通用框架，生成非个人化合成数据。

Result: 合成数据性能接近真实数据，显著优于不保证隐私的现有方法。

Conclusion: 最大化多样性既能提升性能，又能保护隐私，为合成数据应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Synthetic data has recently reached a level of visual fidelity that makes it
nearly indistinguishable from real data, offering great promise for
privacy-preserving data sharing in medical imaging. However, fully synthetic
datasets still suffer from significant limitations: First and foremost, the
legal aspect of sharing synthetic data is often neglected and data regulations,
such as the GDPR, are largley ignored. Secondly, synthetic models fall short of
matching the performance of real data, even for in-domain downstream
applications. Recent methods for image generation have focused on maximising
image diversity instead of fidelity solely to improve the mode coverage and
therefore the downstream performance of synthetic data. In this work, we shift
perspective and highlight how maximizing diversity can also be interpreted as
protecting natural persons from being singled out, which leads to predicate
singling-out (PSO) secure synthetic datasets. Specifically, we propose a
generalisable framework for training diffusion models on personal data which
leads to unpersonal synthetic datasets achieving performance within one
percentage point of real-data models while significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art methods that do not ensure privacy. Our code is available at

Abstract: Markerless motion capture enables the tracking of human motion without

costs compared to traditional systems. However, these advantages often come at
the expense of higher computational demands and slower inference, limiting
their applicability in real-time scenarios. In this technical report, we
present a fast and reliable neural inverse kinematics framework designed for
real-time capture of human body motions from 3D keypoints. We describe the
network architecture, training methodology, and inference procedure in detail.
Our framework is evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively, and we

Result: 在两个公开数据集上，OSDMamba性能提升8.9%和11.8%。

Conclusion: OSDMamba通过改进感受野和特征融合，显著提升了石油泄漏检测的精度。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is commonly used for Oil Spill Detection (OSD) in
remote sensing images. However, the limited availability of labelled oil spill
samples and class imbalance present significant challenges that can reduce
detection accuracy. Furthermore, most existing methods, which rely on
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), struggle to detect small oil spill areas
due to their limited receptive fields and inability to effectively capture
global contextual information. This study explores the potential of State-Space
Models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, to overcome these limitations, building on
their recent success in vision applications. We propose OSDMamba, the first
Mamba-based architecture specifically designed for oil spill detection.
OSDMamba leverages Mamba's selective scanning mechanism to effectively expand
the model's receptive field while preserving critical details. Moreover, we
designed an asymmetric decoder incorporating ConvSSM and deep supervision to
strengthen multi-scale feature fusion, thereby enhancing the model's
sensitivity to minority class samples. Experimental results show that the
proposed OSDMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding improvements
of 8.9% and 11.8% in OSD across two publicly available datasets.

Conclusion: 论文为HOI检测的鲁棒性提供了新见解和实用改进，并计划公开数据集和代码。

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection has seen substantial advances in
recent years. However, existing works focus on the standard setting with ideal
images and natural distribution, far from practical scenarios with inevitable
distribution shifts. This hampers the practical applicability of HOI detection.
In this work, we investigate this issue by benchmarking, analyzing, and
enhancing the robustness of HOI detection models under various distribution
shifts. We start by proposing a novel automated approach to create the first
robustness evaluation benchmark for HOI detection. Subsequently, we evaluate
more than 40 existing HOI detection models on this benchmark, showing their
insufficiency, analyzing the features of different frameworks, and discussing
how the robustness in HOI is different from other tasks. With the insights from
such analyses, we propose to improve the robustness of HOI detection methods
through: (1) a cross-domain data augmentation integrated with mixup, and (2) a
feature fusion strategy with frozen vision foundation models. Both are simple,
plug-and-play, and applicable to various methods. Our experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly increases the robustness
of various methods, with benefits on standard benchmarks, too. The dataset and
code will be released.

on internal benchmarks for Chinese business documents, and reduce inference
latency by $73.0\%$ to the vanilla version. A key innovation of our work is a
data quality optimization strategy for multimodal document tasks. By employing
a large-scale multimodal pre-trained model to evaluate data, we apply a novel
statistical criterion to filter outliers, ensuring high-quality training data.
Inspired by insights into underutilized intermediate features in multimodal
models, we enhance the ViT representational capacity by decomposing it into

Conclusion: MiCo有效提升了WSI分析的性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) has shown significant promise in
histopathology whole slide image (WSI) analysis for cancer diagnosis and
prognosis. However, the inherent spatial heterogeneity of WSIs presents
critical challenges, as morphologically similar tissue types are often
dispersed across distant anatomical regions. Conventional MIL methods struggle
to model these scattered tissue distributions and capture cross-regional
spatial interactions effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel Multiple instance learning framework with Context-Aware Clustering
(MiCo), designed to enhance cross-regional intra-tissue correlations and
strengthen inter-tissue semantic associations in WSIs. MiCo begins by
clustering instances to distill discriminative morphological patterns, with
cluster centroids serving as semantic anchors. To enhance cross-regional
intra-tissue correlations, MiCo employs a Cluster Route module, which
dynamically links instances of the same tissue type across distant regions via
feature similarity. These semantic anchors act as contextual hubs, propagating
semantic relationships to refine instance-level representations. To eliminate
semantic fragmentation and strengthen inter-tissue semantic associations, MiCo
integrates a Cluster Reducer module, which consolidates redundant anchors while
enhancing information exchange between distinct semantic groups. Extensive
experiments on two challenging tasks across nine large-scale public cancer
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MiCo, showcasing its superiority over
state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

Abstract: With the advancement of Large Language Model (LLM) for natural language

layer can process visual tokens for medical image segmentation tasks.
Specifically, we propose a simple hybrid structure that integrates a

framework (LLM4Seg). Surprisingly, this design improves segmentation
performance with a minimal increase in trainable parameters across various
modalities, including ultrasound, dermoscopy, polypscopy, and CT scans. Our

Result: 在临床和公开数据集上优于现有弱监督方法，甚至优于全监督方法。

Conclusion: CmFNet有效解决了弱监督分割中的问题，具有临床实用价值。

Abstract: Accurate automatic medical image segmentation relies on high-quality, dense
annotations, which are costly and time-consuming. Weakly supervised learning
provides a more efficient alternative by leveraging sparse and coarse
annotations instead of dense, precise ones. However, segmentation performance
degradation and overfitting caused by sparse annotations remain key challenges.
To address these issues, we propose CmFNet, a novel 3D weakly supervised
cross-modal medical image segmentation approach. CmFNet consists of three main
components: a modality-specific feature learning network, a cross-modal feature
learning network, and a hybrid-supervised learning strategy. Specifically, the
modality-specific feature learning network and the cross-modal feature learning
network effectively integrate complementary information from multi-modal
images, enhancing shared features across modalities to improve segmentation
performance. Additionally, the hybrid-supervised learning strategy guides
segmentation through scribble supervision, intra-modal regularization, and
inter-modal consistency, modeling spatial and contextual relationships while
promoting feature alignment. Our approach effectively mitigates overfitting,
delivering robust segmentation results. It excels in segmenting both
challenging small tumor regions and common anatomical structures. Extensive
experiments on a clinical cross-modal nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) dataset
(including CT and MR imaging) and the publicly available CT Whole Abdominal
Organ dataset (WORD) show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art weakly
supervised methods. In addition, our approach also outperforms fully supervised
methods when full annotation is used. Our approach can facilitate clinical
therapy and benefit various specialists, including physicists, radiologists,
pathologists, and oncologists.

*Fanyi Wang,Binzhi Dong,Haotian Hu,Jinjin Xu,Zhiwang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种增量训练策略（Incremental Training Strategy），通过自监督链式思维（COT）数据构建系统和分阶段优化，显著提升了小型视觉语言模型（SVLMs）的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SVLMs因参数少导致推理能力受限，但其低成本和低功耗特性具有高商业价值，因此需要提升其性能。

Method: 1. 构建自监督COT数据；2. 分四阶段优化：SFT注入知识、GRPO对齐格式、GRPO增强推理、CLGRPO约束捕获空间。

Result: 在EMOSet-118K数据集上，1B SVLM的准确率提升2.77，召回率提升0.69，性能接近8B模型。

Conclusion: 增量训练策略有效提升了SVLMs的推理能力，使其在保持低成本的同时性能接近更大模型。

Abstract: Small Vision Language Models (SVLMs) generally refer to models with parameter
sizes less than or equal to 2B. Their low cost and power consumption
characteristics confer high commercial value. However, their reasoning
abilities are limited by the number of parameters. To address this issue, this
paper proposes a post-training optimization paradigm called the Incremental
Training Strategy to enhance the reasoning ability of SVLMs. Firstly, we
constructed a Self-Supervised Chain-of-Thought (COT) Data Construction System,
which leverages multiple LVLMs with 7B parameters or more to transform original
data into COT data in a self-supervised manner. Our proposed Incremental
Training Strategy consists of four stages. Stage 1 injects domain knowledge by
performing Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to the pretrained model on the COT
data. Stage 2 aligns the COT data format by conducting a small amount of Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) training constrained only by format rewards
on the COT data. Stage 3 enhances reasoning ability by applying GRPO training
on the COT data with constraints on both format and accuracy rewards. The
resulting model shows significant improvement compared to the baseline. Stage 4
addresses the limited capacity of the SVLMs and the weak ability to capture
complex patterns by proposing ClipLow GRPO (CLGRPO) to constrain the capture
space of the training process. We conducted extensive comparative and ablation
experiments on the abstract semantic recognition dataset EMOSet-118K.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the
reasoning ability of 1B SVLM. Compared to the baseline model fine-tuned on the
original data, accuracy increased by 2.77 and recall by 0.69, achieving
performance comparable to that of 8B models.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于深度学习的非破坏性小麦穗体积估计方法，使用RGB图像序列和3D扫描作为参考，通过结合DINOv2和LSTM网络，显著优于传统几何方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于二维RGB图像在田间条件下存在深度信息丢失、投影失真和遮挡等问题，准确估计小麦穗的三维形态特征具有挑战性。

Method: 采用自监督视觉变换器DINOv2与单向LSTM网络结合的迁移学习管道，通过深度监督学习增强模型的泛化能力。

Result: 在六视角室内图像上，模型平均绝对百分比误差（MAPE）为6.46%，优于传统方法（9.36%和13.98%）。在单图像田间数据上微调后，MAPE为10.82%。

Conclusion: 深度学习方法在复杂几何形状（如小麦穗）的体积预测中表现优于传统几何方法，形状对预测精度有显著影响。

Abstract: Estimating three-dimensional morphological traits from two-dimensional RGB
images presents inherent challenges due to the loss of depth information,
projection distortions, and occlusions under field conditions. In this work, we
explore multiple approaches for non-destructive volume estimation of wheat
spikes, using RGB image sequences and structured-light 3D scans as ground truth
references. Due to the complex geometry of the spikes, we propose a neural
network approach for volume estimation in 2D images, employing a transfer
learning pipeline that combines DINOv2, a self-supervised Vision Transformer,
with a unidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. By using deep
supervision, the model is able to learn more robust intermediate
representations, which enhances its generalisation ability across varying
evaluation sequences. We benchmark our model against two conventional
baselines: a 2D area-based projection and a geometric reconstruction using
axis-aligned cross-sections. Our deep supervised model achieves a mean absolute
percentage error (MAPE) of 6.46% on six-view indoor images, outperforming the
area (9.36%) and geometric (13.98%) baselines. Fine-tuning the model on
field-based single-image data enables domain adaptation, yielding a MAPE of
10.82%. We demonstrate that object shape significantly impacts volume
prediction accuracy, with irregular geometries such as wheat spikes posing
greater challenges for geometric methods compared to our deep learning
approach.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效提升CBMs在新环境中的性能，无需额外训练或牺牲源域准确性。

Abstract: Deep learning-based medical image classification techniques are rapidly
advancing in medical image analysis, making it crucial to develop accurate and
trustworthy models that can be efficiently deployed across diverse clinical
scenarios. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), which first predict a set of
explainable concepts from images and then perform classification based on these
concepts, are increasingly being adopted for explainable medical image
classification. However, the inherent explainability of CBMs introduces new
challenges when deploying trained models to new environments. Variations in
imaging protocols and staining methods may induce concept-level shifts, such as
alterations in color distribution and scale. Furthermore, since CBM training
requires explicit concept annotations, fine-tuning models solely with
image-level labels could compromise concept prediction accuracy and
faithfulness - a critical limitation given the high cost of acquiring
expert-annotated concept labels in medical domains. To address these
challenges, we propose a training-free confusion concept identification
strategy. By leveraging minimal new data (e.g., 4 images per class) with only
image-level labels, our approach enhances out-of-domain performance without
sacrificing source domain accuracy through two key operations: masking
misactivated confounding concepts and amplifying under-activated discriminative
concepts. The efficacy of our method is validated on both skin and white blood
cell images. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 现代多模态模型依赖语言先验和虚假相关性，导致预测定位不准确，需要一种更可靠的方法。

Method: MUPA采用多路径协作设计，包括视频定位、问题回答、答案反思和聚合，通过三种不同的推理路径和反思代理实现一致的结果。

Result: MUPA在2B参数下优于7B规模的竞争对手，7B参数时在NExT-GQA和DeVE-QA上分别达到30.3%和47.4%的Acc@GQA。

Conclusion: MUPA为可信赖的视频-语言理解提供了有效解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Grounded Video Question Answering (Grounded VideoQA) requires aligning
textual answers with explicit visual evidence. However, modern multimodal
models often rely on linguistic priors and spurious correlations, resulting in
poorly grounded predictions. In this work, we propose MUPA, a cooperative
MUlti-Path Agentic approach that unifies video grounding, question answering,
answer reflection and aggregation to tackle Grounded VideoQA. MUPA features
three distinct reasoning paths on the interplay of grounding and QA agents in
different chronological orders, along with a dedicated reflection agent to
judge and aggregate the multi-path results to accomplish consistent QA and
grounding. This design markedly improves grounding fidelity without sacrificing
answer accuracy. Despite using only 2B parameters, our method outperforms all
7B-scale competitors. When scaled to 7B parameters, MUPA establishes new
state-of-the-art results, with Acc@GQA of 30.3% and 47.4% on NExT-GQA and
DeVE-QA respectively, demonstrating MUPA' effectiveness towards trustworthy
video-language understanding. Our code is available in

Result: 在 AIDE 数据集上实现最先进精度，参数少于 600 万，推理速度达 142.32 FPS。

Conclusion: TEM^3-Learning 高效解决了多任务学习中的负迁移问题，适用于实时驾驶辅助系统。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) can advance assistive driving by exploring
inter-task correlations through shared representations. However, existing
methods face two critical limitations: single-modality constraints limiting
comprehensive scene understanding and inefficient architectures impeding
real-time deployment. This paper proposes TEM^3-Learning (Time-Efficient
Multimodal Multi-task Learning), a novel framework that jointly optimizes
driver emotion recognition, driver behavior recognition, traffic context
recognition, and vehicle behavior recognition through a two-stage architecture.
The first component, the mamba-based multi-view temporal-spatial feature
extraction subnetwork (MTS-Mamba), introduces a forward-backward temporal
scanning mechanism and global-local spatial attention to efficiently extract
low-cost temporal-spatial features from multi-view sequential images. The
second component, the MTL-based gated multimodal feature integrator (MGMI),
employs task-specific multi-gating modules to adaptively highlight the most
relevant modality features for each task, effectively alleviating the negative
transfer problem in MTL. Evaluation on the AIDE dataset, our proposed model
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across all four tasks, maintaining a
lightweight architecture with fewer than 6 million parameters and delivering an
impressive 142.32 FPS inference speed. Rigorous ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and the independent
contributions of each module. The code is available on

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal generative models have unlocked photorealistic,
instruction-aligned image generation, yet leading systems like GPT-4o-Image
remain proprietary and inaccessible. To democratize these capabilities, we
present ShareGPT-4o-Image, the first dataset comprising 45K text-to-image and
46K text-and-image-to-image data, all synthesized using GPT-4o's image
generation capabilities for distilling its advanced image generation abilities.
Leveraging this dataset, we develop Janus-4o, a multimodal large language model
capable of both text-to-image and text-and-image-to-image generation. Janus-4o
not only significantly improves text-to-image generation over its predecessor,
Janus-Pro, but also newly supports text-and-image-to-image generation. Notably,
it achieves impressive performance in text-and-image-to-image generation from
scratch, using only 91K synthetic samples and 6 hours of training on an 8
A800-GPU machine. We hope the release of ShareGPT-4o-Image and Janus-4o will
foster open research in photorealistic, instruction-aligned image generation.

TL;DR: 论文分析了VICReg在自监督学习中的潜在不足，提出改进方法SAG-VICReg，增强泛化能力，并在实验中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VICReg可能因过度依赖训练数据而泛化能力不足，需改进以生成更鲁棒的图像表示。

Method: 提出SAG-VICReg，结合新训练技术，提升全局语义捕捉和泛化能力。

Result: SAG-VICReg在泛化能力上优于现有方法，并在全局语义理解指标上表现突出。

Conclusion: SAG-VICReg有效解决了VICReg的泛化问题，并提出新的无标签评估指标。

Abstract: In this paper, we argue that viewing VICReg-a popular self-supervised
learning (SSL) method--through the lens of spectral embedding reveals a
potential source of sub-optimality: it may struggle to generalize robustly to
unseen data due to overreliance on the training data. This observation invites
a closer look at how well this method achieves its goal of producing meaningful
representations of images outside of the training set as well. Here, we
investigate this issue and introduce SAG-VICReg (Stable and Generalizable
VICReg), a method that builds on VICReg by incorporating new training
techniques. These enhancements improve the model's ability to capture global
semantics within the data and strengthen the generalization capabilities.
Experiments demonstrate that SAG-VICReg effectively addresses the
generalization challenge while matching or surpassing diverse state-of-the-art
SSL baselines. Notably, our method exhibits superior performance on metrics
designed to evaluate global semantic understanding, while simultaneously
maintaining competitive results on local evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we
propose a new standalone evaluation metric for embeddings that complements the
standard evaluation methods and accounts for the global data structure without
requiring labels--a key issue when tagged data is scarce or not available.

Abstract: Polyp detection is crucial for colorectal cancer screening, yet existing
models are limited by the scale and diversity of available data. While
generative models show promise for data augmentation, current methods mainly
focus on enhancing polyp diversity, often overlooking the critical issue of
false positives. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing an adversarial
diffusion framework to synthesize high-value false positives. The extensive
variability of negative backgrounds presents a significant challenge in false
positive synthesis. To overcome this, we introduce two key innovations: First,
we design a regional noise matching strategy to construct a negative synthesis
space using polyp detection datasets. This strategy trains a negative-centric
diffusion model by masking polyp regions, ensuring the model focuses
exclusively on learning diverse background patterns. Second, we introduce the
Detector-guided Adversarial Diffusion Attacker (DADA) module, which perturbs
the negative synthesis process to disrupt a pre-trained detector's decision,
guiding the negative-centric diffusion model to generate high-value,
detector-confusing false positives instead of low-value, ordinary backgrounds.
Our approach is the first to apply adversarial diffusion to lesion detection,
establishing a new paradigm for targeted false positive synthesis and paving
the way for more reliable clinical applications in colorectal cancer screening.
Extensive results on public and in-house datasets verify the superiority of our
method over the current state-of-the-arts, with our synthesized data improving
the detectors by at least 2.6% and 2.7% in F1-score, respectively, over the
baselines. Codes are at https://github.com/Huster-Hq/DADA.

Conclusion: 研究验证了比较分析在医学诊断中的临床价值，为VLMs引入参考图像提供了新策略。

Abstract: Medical imaging diagnosis presents inherent challenges due to diseases that
mimic normal anatomy and exhibit significant inter-patient variability.
Clinicians routinely employ comparative reasoning-using reference images from
healthy controls or previous patient examinations-to discern subtle yet
diagnostically critical abnormalities. However, existing medical
vision-language models (VLMs) focus primarily on single-image or single-series
analyses and lack explicit mechanisms for comparative reasoning. Conversely,
general-purpose VLMs demonstrate strong multi-image comparative reasoning
capabilities but lack essential medical-domain knowledge to identify nuanced
clinical differences. This work aims to bridge this gap by exploring
clinically-inspired comparative analysis within VLMs, leveraging reference
images to enhance diagnostic accuracy. Through extensive empirical analysis, we
show that providing general-purpose VLMs with query and normative matched
reference images, accompanied by clinically-informed comparative prompts,
significantly improves diagnostic outcomes compared to single-image baselines,
especially after supervised finetuning (SFT). Our contributions highlight the
clinical relevance of comparative analysis introduce novel strategies for
leveraging reference images in VLMs, empirically demonstrate enhanced
performance across multiple medical visual question answering (VQA) tasks, and
provide theoretical insights into the efficacy of comparative image analysis in
medical diagnosis.

Method: 利用卷积神经网络（如Faster R-CNN和YOLOv4）识别散焦粒子图像中的模式差异，并通过生成对抗网络生成标记数据。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集中，检测精度和分类准确率达到95-100%，即使存在领域偏移。

Conclusion: 证实了CNN在分散两相流中的相位分离具有可行性，尤其在传统方法不适用时表现优异。

Abstract: This work investigates the feasibility of a post-processing-based approach
for phase separation in defocusing particle tracking velocimetry for dispersed
two-phase flows. The method enables the simultaneous 3D localization
determination of both tracer particles and particles of the dispersed phase,
using a single-camera setup. The distinction between phases is based on pattern
differences in defocused particle images, which arise from distinct light
scattering behaviors of tracer particles and bubbles or droplets. Convolutional
neural networks, including Faster R-CNN and YOLOv4 variants, are trained to
detect and classify particle images based on these pattern features. To
generate large, labeled training datasets, a generative adversarial network
based framework is introduced, allowing the generation of auto-labeled data
that more closely reflects experiment-specific visual appearance. Evaluation
across six datasets, comprising synthetic two-phase and real single- and
two-phase flows, demonstrates high detection precision and classification
accuracy (95-100%), even under domain shifts. The results confirm the viability
of using CNNs for robust phase separation in disperse two-phase DPTV,
particularly in scenarios where traditional wavelength-, size-, or ensemble
correlation-based methods are impractical.

Result: CDG-MAE显著优于仅依赖图像的MAE方法，并大幅缩小与基于视频方法的性能差距。

Conclusion: CDG-MAE为密集对应学习提供了一种高效的自监督解决方案，克服了数据获取的局限性。

Abstract: Learning dense correspondences, critical for application such as video label
propagation, is hindered by tedious and unscalable manual annotation.
Self-supervised methods address this by using a cross-view pretext task, often
modeled with a masked autoencoder, where a masked target view is reconstructed
from an anchor view. However, acquiring effective training data remains a
challenge - collecting diverse video datasets is difficult and costly, while
simple image crops lack necessary pose variations. This paper introduces
CDG-MAE, a novel MAE-based self-supervised method that uses diverse synthetic
views generated from static images via an image-conditioned diffusion model.
These generated views exhibit substantial changes in pose and perspective,
providing a rich training signal that overcomes the limitations of video and
crop-based anchors. We present a quantitative method to evaluate local and
global consistency of generated images, discussing their use for cross-view
self-supervised pretraining. Furthermore, we enhance the standard single-anchor
MAE setting to a multi-anchor strategy to effectively modulate the difficulty
of pretext task. CDG-MAE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MAE methods
reliant only on images and substantially narrows the performance gap to
video-based approaches.

Abstract: Thyroid cancer is among the most common cancers in the United States. Thyroid
nodules are frequently detected through ultrasound (US) imaging, and some
require further evaluation via fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy. Despite its
effectiveness, FNA often leads to unnecessary biopsies of benign nodules,
causing patient discomfort and anxiety. To address this, the American College
of Radiology Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) has been
developed to reduce benign biopsies. However, such systems are limited by
interobserver variability. Recent deep learning approaches have sought to
improve risk stratification, but they often fail to utilize the rich temporal
and spatial context provided by US cine clips, which contain dynamic global
information and surrounding structural changes across various views. In this
work, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Cross Attention for Cine Thyroid
Ultrasound Time Series Classification (STACT-Time) model, a novel
representation learning framework that integrates imaging features from US cine
clips with features from segmentation masks automatically generated by a
pretrained model. By leveraging self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms,
our model captures the rich temporal and spatial context of US cine clips while
enhancing feature representation through segmentation-guided learning. Our
model improves malignancy prediction compared to state-of-the-art models,
achieving a cross-validation precision of 0.91 (plus or minus 0.02) and an F1
score of 0.89 (plus or minus 0.02). By reducing unnecessary biopsies of benign
nodules while maintaining high sensitivity for malignancy detection, our model
has the potential to enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient
outcomes.

Abstract: While deep learning-based architectures have been widely used for correctly
detecting and classifying plant diseases, they require large-scale datasets to
learn generalized features and achieve state-of-the-art performance. This poses
a challenge for such models to obtain satisfactory performance in classifying
leaf diseases with limited samples. This work proposes a few-shot learning
framework, Domain-adapted Expert Network (DExNet), for plant disease
classification that compensates for the lack of sufficient training data by
combining observations of a number of expert critics. It starts with extracting
the feature embeddings as 'observations' from nine 'critics' that are
state-of-the-art pre-trained CNN-based architectures. These critics are 'domain
adapted' using a publicly available leaf disease dataset having no overlapping
classes with the specific downstream task of interest. The observations are
then passed to the 'Feature Fusion Block' and finally to a classifier network
consisting of Bi-LSTM layers. The proposed pipeline is evaluated on the 10
classes of tomato leaf images from the PlantVillage dataset, achieving
promising accuracies of 89.06%, 92.46%, and 94.07%, respectively, for 5-shot,
10-shot, and 15-shot classification. Furthermore, an accuracy of 98.09+-0.7%
has been achieved in 80-shot classification, which is only 1.2% less than
state-of-the-art, allowing a 94.5% reduction in the training data requirement.
The proposed pipeline also outperforms existing works on leaf disease
classification with limited data in both laboratory and real-life conditions in
single-domain, mixed-domain, and cross-domain scenarios.

TL;DR: FMF-SLAM是一种高效的多模态融合SLAM方法，利用FFT提升算法效率，适用于噪声、光照变化和黑暗环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统基于光流的视觉SLAM在噪声、光照变化和黑暗环境中计算资源需求高的问题。

Method: 提出基于傅里叶的自注意力和交叉注意力机制，结合RGB和深度信号特征，并通过多尺度知识蒸馏增强多模态特征交互。

Result: 在TUM、TartanAir和真实数据集上验证了FMF-SLAM在噪声、光照变化和黑暗条件下的先进性能。

Conclusion: FMF-SLAM通过高效的多模态融合和实时性能，适用于复杂环境下的视觉SLAM任务。

Abstract: Visual SLAM is particularly challenging in environments affected by noise,
varying lighting conditions, and darkness. Learning-based optical flow
algorithms can leverage multiple modalities to address these challenges, but
traditional optical flow-based visual SLAM approaches often require significant
computational resources.To overcome this limitation, we propose FMF-SLAM, an
efficient multimodal fusion SLAM method that utilizes fast Fourier transform
(FFT) to enhance the algorithm efficiency. Specifically, we introduce a novel
Fourier-based self-attention and cross-attention mechanism to extract features
from RGB and depth signals. We further enhance the interaction of multimodal
features by incorporating multi-scale knowledge distillation across modalities.
We also demonstrate the practical feasibility of FMF-SLAM in real-world
scenarios with real time performance by integrating it with a security robot by
fusing with a global positioning module GNSS-RTK and global Bundle Adjustment.
Our approach is validated using video sequences from TUM, TartanAir, and our
real-world datasets, showcasing state-of-the-art performance under noisy,
varying lighting, and dark conditions.Our code and datasets are available at

*Ankit Sanjyal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DINO增强的NeRF模型在极少数样本场景下表现不如基线NeRF，PSNR值更低，表明预训练视觉特征可能无益甚至有害。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索预训练视觉特征（如DINO）在极少数样本3D重建中的有效性，验证其是否能提升NeRF的性能。

Method: 系统评估DINO增强的NeRF模型，包括基线NeRF、冻结DINO特征、LoRA微调特征和多尺度特征融合。

Result: 所有DINO变体表现均不如基线NeRF，PSNR值更低（12.9-13.0 vs 14.71），表明预训练特征可能引入有害偏差。

Conclusion: 预训练视觉特征可能不适合极少数样本3D重建，建议关注几何一致性的简单架构。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have revolutionized 3D scene reconstruction
from sparse image collections. Recent work has explored integrating pre-trained
vision features, particularly from DINO, to enhance few-shot reconstruction
capabilities. However, the effectiveness of such approaches remains unclear,
especially in extreme few-shot scenarios. In this paper, we present a
systematic evaluation of DINO-enhanced NeRF models, comparing baseline NeRF,
frozen DINO features, LoRA fine-tuned features, and multi-scale feature fusion.
Surprisingly, our experiments reveal that all DINO variants perform worse than
the baseline NeRF, achieving PSNR values around 12.9 to 13.0 compared to the
baseline's 14.71. This counterintuitive result suggests that pre-trained vision
features may not be beneficial for few-shot 3D reconstruction and may even
introduce harmful biases. We analyze potential causes including feature-task
mismatch, overfitting to limited data, and integration challenges. Our findings
challenge common assumptions in the field and suggest that simpler
architectures focusing on geometric consistency may be more effective for
few-shot scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于深度学习的膝关节对齐（KA）测量方法，通过自动定位膝关节解剖标志，实现高精度测量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统KA测量方法耗时且依赖长腿X光片，需自动化解决方案以提高效率和准确性。

Method: 采用沙漏网络和注意力门结构，自动定位100多个膝关节解剖标志，并测量解剖胫股角。

Result: 与临床测量相比，平均绝对差异约1度，术前ICC为0.97，术后为0.86。

Conclusion: 该方法能高精度自动化KA评估，为临床工作流提供数字化支持。

Abstract: Radiographic knee alignment (KA) measurement is important for predicting
joint health and surgical outcomes after total knee replacement. Traditional
methods for KA measurements are manual, time-consuming and require long-leg
radiographs. This study proposes a deep learning-based method to measure KA in
anteroposterior knee radiographs via automatically localized knee anatomical
landmarks. Our method builds on hourglass networks and incorporates an
attention gate structure to enhance robustness and focus on key anatomical
features. To our knowledge, this is the first deep learning-based method to
localize over 100 knee anatomical landmarks to fully outline the knee shape
while integrating KA measurements on both pre-operative and post-operative
images. It provides highly accurate and reliable anatomical varus/valgus KA
measurements using the anatomical tibiofemoral angle, achieving mean absolute
differences ~1{\deg} when compared to clinical ground truth measurements.
Agreement between automated and clinical measurements was excellent
pre-operatively (intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.97) and good
post-operatively (ICC = 0.86). Our findings demonstrate that KA assessment can
be automated with high accuracy, creating opportunities for digitally enhanced
clinical workflows.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于长波红外（LWIR）偏振的形状估计方法，通过改进偏振模型和结合学习与模型方法，解决了透明物体形状估计的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 透明物体的形状估计因复杂的光传输而困难，传统方法在长波红外偏振（LWIR SfP）中存在较大误差，主要源于偏振模型的不完善，尤其是忽略了反射效应。

Method: 提出了一种新的偏振模型，综合考虑发射和反射效应，并采用基于模型和学习的方法（神经网络）估计表面法线。同时，建模了LWIR偏振成像过程以消除系统误差。

Result: 开发了原型系统和首个真实世界LWIR SfP基准数据集ThermoPol，实验证明该方法在多种材料（包括可见光透明材料）上具有高精度和广泛适用性。

Conclusion: 通过改进偏振模型和结合多种方法，论文成功解决了透明物体在LWIR中的形状估计问题，并提供了实用的数据集和系统。

Abstract: Shape estimation for transparent objects is challenging due to their complex
light transport. To circumvent these difficulties, we leverage the Shape from
Polarization (SfP) technique in the Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR) spectrum, where
most materials are opaque and emissive. While a few prior studies have explored
LWIR SfP, these attempts suffered from significant errors due to inadequate
polarimetric modeling, particularly the neglect of reflection. Addressing this
gap, we formulated a polarization model that explicitly accounts for the
combined effects of emission and reflection. Based on this model, we estimated
surface normals using not only a direct model-based method but also a
learning-based approach employing a neural network trained on a
physically-grounded synthetic dataset. Furthermore, we modeled the LWIR
polarimetric imaging process, accounting for inherent systematic errors to
ensure accurate polarimetry. We implemented a prototype system and created
ThermoPol, the first real-world benchmark dataset for LWIR SfP. Through
comprehensive experiments, we demonstrated the high accuracy and broad
applicability of our method across various materials, including those
transparent in the visible spectrum.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级、可部署于边缘设备的视网膜疾病分类器，通过跨架构知识蒸馏方法，将高性能的ViT教师模型压缩为适合低资源环境的CNN学生模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源有限的地区，缺乏可靠的视网膜疾病诊断设备，因此需要开发一种轻量级且准确的分类器。

Method: 使用I-JEPA自监督学习预训练ViT教师模型，再通过包含PCA投影器、GL投影器和多视图鲁棒训练方法的新框架，将其压缩为CNN学生模型。

Result: 学生模型参数比教师模型少97.4%，分类准确率达89%，保留了教师模型93%的诊断性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了ViT模型的压缩并保持准确性，为资源匮乏地区提供了一种可扩展的AI驱动视网膜疾病筛查方案。

Abstract: Early and accurate identification of retinal ailments is crucial for averting
ocular decline; however, access to dependable diagnostic devices is not often
available in low-resourced settings. This project proposes to solve that by
developing a lightweight, edge-device deployable disease classifier using
cross-architecture knowledge distilling. We first train a high-capacity vision
transformer (ViT) teacher model, pre-trained using I-JEPA self-supervised
learning, to classify fundus images into four classes: Normal, Diabetic
Retinopathy, Glaucoma, and Cataract. We kept an Internet of Things (IoT) focus
when compressing to a CNN-based student model for deployment in
resource-limited conditions, such as the NVIDIA Jetson Nano. This was
accomplished using a novel framework which included a Partitioned
Cross-Attention (PCA) projector, a Group-Wise Linear (GL) projector, and a
multi-view robust training method. The teacher model has 97.4 percent more
parameters than the student model, with it achieving 89 percent classification
with a roughly 93 percent retention of the teacher model's diagnostic
performance. The retention of clinical classification behavior supports our
method's initial aim: compression of the ViT while retaining accuracy. Our work
serves as an example of a scalable, AI-driven triage solution for retinal
disorders in under-resourced areas.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需训练的动态稀疏注意力方法（ADSA），用于优化自回归图像生成模型中的上下文计算，显著减少内存消耗和计算延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归图像生成模型在推理过程中因长上下文导致内存开销大和计算延迟高，需要一种高效的方法来优化注意力计算。

Method: 提出ADSA方法，动态识别关键历史token以维持局部纹理一致性和全局语义连贯性，并引入动态KV-cache更新机制。

Result: 实验表明ADSA在生成质量和资源效率上均表现优越，GPU内存消耗减少约50%。

Conclusion: ADSA是一种高效且无需训练的上下文优化方法，显著提升了自回归图像生成模型的性能。

Abstract: Autoregressive conditional image generation models have emerged as a dominant
paradigm in text-to-image synthesis. These methods typically convert images
into one-dimensional token sequences and leverage the self-attention mechanism,
which has achieved remarkable success in natural language processing, to
capture long-range dependencies, model global context, and ensure semantic
coherence. However, excessively long contexts during inference lead to
significant memory overhead caused by KV-cache and computational delays. To
alleviate these challenges, we systematically analyze how global semantics,
spatial layouts, and fine-grained textures are formed during inference, and
propose a novel training-free context optimization method called Adaptive
Dynamic Sparse Attention (ADSA). Conceptually, ADSA dynamically identifies
historical tokens crucial for maintaining local texture consistency and those
essential for ensuring global semantic coherence, thereby efficiently
streamlining attention computation. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic
KV-cache update mechanism tailored for ADSA, reducing GPU memory consumption
during inference by approximately $50\%$. Extensive qualitative and
quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our
approach in terms of both generation quality and resource efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法TIR和REC分别存在精度不足和扩展性差的问题，无法满足实际场景中实例级检索与定位的需求。

Method: 提出REIR任务，构建REIRCOCO基准，开发CLARE方法，采用双流架构和MORE模块，结合目标检测与REC预训练。

Result: CLARE在REIR任务上表现优异，同时在TIR和REC任务上泛化能力强。

Conclusion: REIR填补了任务空白，CLARE方法高效且通用，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Natural language querying of visual content underpins many vision-language
tasks, typically categorized by text granularity and visual search scope.
Text-Image Retrieval (TIR) retrieves whole images using coarse descriptions,
while Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) localizes objects using
fine-grained expressions within a single image. However, real-world scenarios
often require both instance-level retrieval and localization across large
galleries -- tasks where TIR lacks precision and REC lacks scalability. To
address this gap, we propose a new task: Referring Expression Instance
Retrieval (REIR), which jointly supports instance-level retrieval and
localization. We introduce REIRCOCO, a large-scale benchmark constructed by
prompting vision-language models to generate fine-grained expressions for
MSCOCO and RefCOCO instances. We also present a baseline method, CLARE,
featuring a dual-stream architecture with a Mix of Relation Experts (MORE)
module for capturing inter-instance relationships. CLARE integrates object
detection and REC pretraining with Contrastive Language-Instance Alignment
(CLIA) for end-to-end optimization. Experiments show that CLARE achieves
state-of-the-art performance on REIR and generalizes well to TIR and REC,
highlighting its effectiveness and versatility.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种模型、领域和任务中均优于现有生成攻击方法。

Conclusion: 通过锚定语义显著区域生成扰动，显著提升了对抗迁移性，验证了语义结构感知攻击框架的有效性。

Abstract: Generative adversarial attacks train a perturbation generator on a white-box
surrogate model and subsequently apply the crafted perturbations to unseen
black-box victim models. In contrast to iterative attacks, these methods
deliver superior inference-time efficiency, scalability, and transferability;
however, up until now, existing studies have not fully exploited the
representational capacity of generative models to preserve and harness semantic
information. Specifically, the intermediate activations of the generator encode
rich semantic features--object boundaries and coarse shapes--that remain
under-exploited, thereby limiting the alignment of perturbations with
object-salient regions which are critical for adversarial transferability. To
remedy this, we introduce a semantic structure-aware attack framework based on
the Mean Teacher, which serves as a temporally smoothed feature reference. With
this smoothed reference, we further direct semantic consistency between the
early-layer activations in the student and those of the semantically rich
teacher by feature distillation. By anchoring perturbation synthesis to the
semantically salient early intermediate blocks within the generator based on
empirical findings, our method guides progressive adversarial perturbation on
regions that substantially enhance adversarial transferability. We conduct
extensive experiments over diverse models, domains and tasks to demonstrate
consistent improvements relative to state-of-the-art generative attacks,
comprehensively evaluated using conventional metrics and our newly proposed
Accidental Correction Rate (ACR).

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弱监督时序动作定位任务中仅提供视频级标注，难以直接生成帧级标签。

Result: 通过多尺度时序信息交换，提升了时序动作定位性能。

Conclusion: 两阶段方法有效利用多分辨率信息，显著提升了弱监督时序动作定位的效果。

Abstract: Weakly supervised temporal action localization is a challenging task as only
the video-level annotation is available during the training process. To address
this problem, we propose a two-stage approach to fully exploit multi-resolution
information in the temporal domain and generate high quality frame-level pseudo
labels based on both appearance and motion streams. Specifically, in the first
stage, we generate reliable initial frame-level pseudo labels, and in the
second stage, we iteratively refine the pseudo labels and use a set of selected
frames with highly confident pseudo labels to train neural networks and better
predict action class scores at each frame. We fully exploit temporal
information at multiple scales to improve temporal action localization
performance. Specifically, in order to obtain reliable initial frame-level
pseudo labels, in the first stage, we propose an Initial Label Generation (ILG)
module, which leverages temporal multi-resolution consistency to generate high
quality class activation sequences (CASs), which consist of a number of
sequences with each sequence measuring how likely each video frame belongs to
one specific action class. In the second stage, we propose a Progressive
Temporal Label Refinement (PTLR) framework. In our PTLR framework, two networks
called Network-OTS and Network-RTS, which are respectively used to generate
CASs for the original temporal scale and the reduced temporal scales, are used
as two streams (i.e., the OTS stream and the RTS stream) to refine the pseudo
labels in turn. By this way, the multi-resolution information in the temporal
domain is exchanged at the pseudo label level, and our work can help improve
each stream (i.e., the OTS/RTS stream) by exploiting the refined pseudo labels
from another stream (i.e., the RTS/OTS stream).

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction in the past was considered to require
precise geometric relationships in order to enable effective training. However,
in complex indoor environments, the large-scale and widespread collection of
data, along with the necessity for fine-grained annotations, becomes
impractical due to the complexity of data acquisition setups and privacy
concerns. In this paper, we demonstrate that 3D spatially-accurate training can
be achieved using only indoor Internet data, without the need for any
pre-knowledge of intrinsic or extrinsic camera parameters. In our framework, we
collect a web dataset, YouTube-Occ, which comprises house tour videos from
YouTube, providing abundant real house scenes for 3D representation learning.
Upon on this web dataset, we establish a fully self-supervised model to
leverage accessible 2D prior knowledge for reaching powerful 3D indoor
perception. Specifically, we harness the advantages of the prosperous vision
foundation models, distilling the 2D region-level knowledge into the occupancy
network by grouping the similar pixels into superpixels. Experimental results
show that our method achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on two
popular benchmarks (NYUv2 and OccScanNet

Conclusion: ThermalLoc为热图像重定位提供了高效解决方案，性能显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Thermal cameras capture environmental data through heat emission, a
fundamentally different mechanism compared to visible light cameras, which rely
on pinhole imaging. As a result, traditional visual relocalization methods
designed for visible light images are not directly applicable to thermal
images. Despite significant advancements in deep learning for camera
relocalization, approaches specifically tailored for thermal camera-based
relocalization remain underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce
ThermalLoc, a novel end-to-end deep learning method for thermal image
relocalization. ThermalLoc effectively extracts both local and global features
from thermal images by integrating EfficientNet with Transformers, and performs
absolute pose regression using two MLP networks. We evaluated ThermalLoc on
both the publicly available thermal-odometry dataset and our own dataset. The
results demonstrate that ThermalLoc outperforms existing representative methods
employed for thermal camera relocalization, including AtLoc, MapNet, PoseNet,
and RobustLoc, achieving superior accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: As the deep learning revolution marches on, masked modeling has emerged as a
distinctive approach that involves predicting parts of the original data that
are proportionally masked during training, and has demonstrated exceptional
performance in multiple fields. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reconstruction
is a critical task in medical imaging that seeks to recover high-quality images
from under-sampled k-space data. However, previous MRI reconstruction
strategies usually optimized the entire image domain or k-space, without
considering the importance of different frequency regions in the k-space This
work introduces a diffusion model based on adaptive masks (AMDM), which
utilizes the adaptive adjustment of frequency distribution based on k-space
data to develop a hybrid masks mechanism that adapts to different k-space
inputs. This enables the effective separation of high-frequency and
low-frequency components, producing diverse frequency-specific representations.
Additionally, the k-space frequency distribution informs the generation of
adaptive masks, which, in turn, guide a closed-loop diffusion process.
Experimental results verified the ability of this method to learn specific
frequency information and thereby improved the quality of MRI reconstruction,
providing a flexible framework for optimizing k-space data using masks in the
future.

Abstract: Image explanation has been one of the key research interests in the Deep
Learning field. Throughout the years, several approaches have been adopted to
explain an input image fed by the user. From detecting an object in a given
image to explaining it in human understandable sentence, to having a
conversation describing the image, this problem has seen an immense change
throughout the years, However, the existing works have been often found to (a)
hallucinate objects that do not exist in the image and/or (b) lack identifying
the complete set of objects present in the image. In this paper, we propose a
novel approach to mitigate these drawbacks of inconsistency and incompleteness
of the objects recognized during the image explanation. To enable this, we
propose an interpretable framework that can be plugged atop diverse image
explaining frameworks including Image Captioning, Visual Question Answering
(VQA) and Prompt-based AI using LLMs, thereby enhancing their explanation
capabilities by rectifying the incorrect or missing objects. We further measure
the efficacy of the rectified explanations generated through our proposed
approaches leveraging object based precision metrics, and showcase the
improvements in the inconsistency and completeness of image explanations.
Quantitatively, the proposed framework is able to improve the explanations over
the baseline architectures of Image Captioning (improving the completeness by
81.81% and inconsistency by 37.10%), Visual Question Answering(average of 9.6%
and 37.10% in completeness and inconsistency respectively) and Prompt-based AI
model (0.01% and 5.2% for completeness and inconsistency respectively)
surpassing the current state-of-the-art by a substantial margin.

Abstract: Endoscopic image classification plays a pivotal role in medical diagnostics
by identifying anatomical landmarks and pathological findings. However,
conventional closed-set classification frameworks are inherently limited in
open-world clinical settings, where previously unseen conditions can arise
andcompromise model reliability. To address this, we explore the application of
Open Set Recognition (OSR) techniques on the Kvasir dataset, a publicly
available and diverse endoscopic image collection. In this study, we evaluate
and compare the OSR capabilities of several representative deep learning
architectures, including ResNet-50, Swin Transformer, and a hybrid
ResNet-Transformer model, under both closed-set and open-set conditions.
OpenMax is adopted as a baseline OSR method to assess the ability of these
models to distinguish known classes from previously unseen categories. This
work represents one of the first efforts to apply open set recognition to the
Kvasir dataset and provides a foundational benchmark for evaluating OSR
performance in medical image analysis. Our results offer practical insights
into model behavior in clinically realistic settings and highlight the
importance of OSR techniques for the safe deployment of AI systems in
endoscopy.

Conclusion: 该方法通过智能邻居选择和梯度优化，实现了高效且准确的轨迹预测。

Abstract: This paper presents an architecture for selecting important neighboring
people to predict the primary person's trajectory. To achieve effective
neighboring people selection, we propose a people selection module called the
Importance Estimator which outputs the importance of each neighboring person
for predicting the primary person's future trajectory. To prevent gradients
from being blocked by non-differentiable operations when sampling surrounding
people based on their importance, we employ the Gumbel Softmax for training.
Experiments conducted on the JRDB dataset show that our method speeds up the
process with competitive prediction accuracy.

*Ziyue Guo,Xin Yang,Yutao Shen,Yang Zhu,Lixi Jiang,Haiyan Cen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多视角成像的油菜群体点云补全模型（RP-PCN），用于从幼苗到角果期的3D重建，显著提高了产量预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 完整的冠层结构描述对评估作物光合作用和产量至关重要，但现有3D重建技术因遮挡和复杂结构难以实现准确描述。

Method: 结合虚拟-现实集成（VRI）模拟方法和遮挡点检测算法，设计RP-PCN网络，包含多分辨率动态图卷积编码器（MRDG）和点金字塔解码器（PPD）。

Result: RP-PCN在幼苗、抽薹、开花和角果期的CD值分别为3.35 cm、3.46 cm、4.32 cm和4.51 cm，MRDG和DGCFE模块分别降低CD值10%和23%。

Conclusion: RP-PCN显著提高了产量预测精度，并有望扩展到其他作物，增强田间群体冠层结构的分析能力。

Abstract: Quantitative descriptions of complete canopy architecture are crucial for
evaluating crop photosynthesis and yield to guide ideotype design. Although
three-dimensional (3D) sensing technologies have been developed for plant and
canopy reconstruction, severe occlusion and complex architectures hinder
accurate canopy descriptions. In this study, we propose a point cloud
completion model for 3D reconstruction of rapeseed populations from seeding to
silique stages using multi-view imaging. A complete point cloud generation
framework was developed with the virtual-real integration (VRI) simulation
method and occlusion point detection algorithm to annotate the training dataset
by distinguishing surface from occluded points. The rapeseed population point
cloud completion network (RP-PCN) was designed with a multi-resolution dynamic
graph convolutional encoder (MRDG) and point pyramid decoder (PPD) to predict
occluded points based on input surface point clouds. A dynamic graph
convolutional feature extractor (DGCFE) was introduced to capture structural
variations across the growth period. The effectiveness of point cloud
completion was validated by predicting yield using architectural indicators
from complete point clouds of rapeseed population. The results demonstrated
that RP-PCN achieved chamfer distance (CD) values of 3.35 cm, 3.46 cm, 4.32 cm,
and 4.51 cm at the seedling, bolting, flowering, and silique stages,
respectively. Ablation studies showed the effectiveness of the MRDG and DGCFE
modules, reducing CD values by 10% and 23%, respectively. The silique
efficiency index (SEI) from RP-PCN improved yield prediction accuracy by 11.2%
compared to incomplete point clouds. The RP-PCN pipeline proposed in this study
has the potential to be extended to other crops, significantly enhancing the
analysis of population canopy architectures in field environments.

Conclusion: 研究表明，结合遥感数据和高级建模技术可以有效提升灌溉农业区的作物分类精度。

Abstract: Remote sensing offers a highly effective method for obtaining accurate
information on total cropped area and crop types. The study focuses on crop
cover identification for irrigated regions of Central Punjab. Data collection
was executed in two stages: the first involved identifying and geocoding six
target crops through field surveys conducted in January and February 2023. The
second stage involved acquiring Landsat 8-9 imagery for each geocoded field to
construct a labelled dataset. The satellite imagery underwent extensive
pre-processing, including radiometric calibration for reflectance values,
atmospheric correction, and georeferencing verification to ensure consistency
within a common coordinate system. Subsequently, image fusion techniques were
applied to combine Landsat 8 and 9 spectral bands, creating a composite image
with enhanced spectral information, followed by contrast enhancement. During
data acquisition, farmers were interviewed, and fields were meticulously mapped
using GPS instruments, resulting in a comprehensive dataset of 50,835 data
points. This dataset facilitated the extraction of vegetation indices such as
NDVI, SAVO, RECI, and NDRE. These indices and raw reflectance values were
utilized for classification modeling using conventional classifiers, ensemble
learning, and artificial neural networks. A feature selection approach was also
incorporated to identify the optimal feature set for classification learning.
This study demonstrates the effectiveness of combining remote sensing data and
advanced modeling techniques to improve crop classification accuracy in
irrigated agricultural regions.

*Yiwei Yang,Chung Peng Lee,Shangbin Feng,Dora Zhao,Bingbing Wen,Anthony Z. Liu,Yulia Tsvetkov,Bill Howe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究了多模态大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）中虚假相关性的问题，开发了一个名为SpuriVerse的基准测试，评估了15种模型的表现，并发现通过微调可以显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索LVLMs中非本质特征与目标标签之间的虚假相关性，尤其是在缺乏明确任务监督的预训练模型中。

Method: 方法包括从GPT-4o的错误中提取真实世界的视觉问答（VQA）数据，并通过人工标注和合成反事实评估构建SpuriVerse基准。

Result: 结果显示，即使是顶尖的闭源模型在SpuriVerse上表现不佳（最高37.1%准确率），但通过微调合成样本，性能提升至78.40%。

Conclusion: 结论表明，模型能够通过学习多样化的虚假模式来避免‘捷径’行为，从而更好地关注图像整体上下文。

Abstract: Finetuning can cause spurious correlations to arise between non-essential
features and the target labels, but benchmarks to study these effects involve
contrived settings and narrow tasks. In contrast, we consider spurious
correlations in multi-modal Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) pretrained on
extensive and diverse datasets without explicit task supervision. We develop a
benchmark by sourcing GPT-4o errors on real-world visual-question-answering
(VQA) benchmarks, then curating a subset through LVLM-human annotation and
synthetic counterfactual evaluation to identify errors caused by spurious
correlations. This process yields SpuriVerse, a novel benchmark comprised of
124 distinct types of spurious correlations extracted from real-world datasets,
each containing 1 realistic and 10 synthetic VQA samples for a total of 1364
multiple choice questions. We evaluate 15 open and closed-source LVLMs on
SpuriVerse, finding that even state-of-the-art closed-source models struggle
significantly, achieving at best only 37.1% accuracy. Fine-tuning on synthetic
examples that emphasize the spurious correlation improves performance to
78.40%, suggesting that training on diverse spurious patterns generalizes to
unseen situations: models appear to learn to avoid "shortcuts" and attend to
the overall image context.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement remains a challenging task, particularly in the
absence of paired training data. In this study, we present LucentVisionNet, a
novel zero-shot learning framework that addresses the limitations of
traditional and deep learning-based enhancement methods. The proposed approach
integrates multi-scale spatial attention with a deep curve estimation network,
enabling fine-grained enhancement while preserving semantic and perceptual
fidelity. To further improve generalization, we adopt a recurrent enhancement
strategy and optimize the model using a composite loss function comprising six
tailored components, including a novel no-reference image quality loss inspired
by human visual perception. Extensive experiments on both paired and unpaired
benchmark datasets demonstrate that LucentVisionNet consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art supervised, unsupervised, and zero-shot methods across
multiple full-reference and no-reference image quality metrics. Our framework
achieves high visual quality, structural consistency, and computational
efficiency, making it well-suited for deployment in real-world applications
such as mobile photography, surveillance, and autonomous navigation.

TL;DR: 论文提出PromptSan方法，通过两种变体（PromptSan-Modify和PromptSan-Suffix）净化有害提示词，以降低文本到图像模型生成有害内容的风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像模型的快速发展带来了滥用风险，如生成有害内容（色情、暴力等），违背伦理目标并阻碍可持续发展。

Method: PromptSan包括两种方法：1) PromptSan-Modify通过文本NSFW分类器迭代识别并替换有害提示词；2) PromptSan-Suffix训练优化的后缀标记序列中和有害意图。

Result: 实验表明，PromptSan在减少有害内容生成方面表现优异，平衡了安全性和可用性。

Conclusion: PromptSan是一种无需修改模型架构即可有效减少有害内容生成的新方法。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models, such as Stable
Diffusion, has enhanced their capability to synthesize images from textual
prompts. However, this progress also raises significant risks of misuse,
including the generation of harmful content (e.g., pornography, violence,
discrimination), which contradicts the ethical goals of T2I technology and
hinders its sustainable development. Inspired by "jailbreak" attacks in large
language models, which bypass restrictions through subtle prompt modifications,
this paper proposes NSFW-Classifier Guided Prompt Sanitization (PromptSan), a
novel approach to detoxify harmful prompts without altering model architecture
or degrading generation capability. PromptSan includes two variants:
PromptSan-Modify, which iteratively identifies and replaces harmful tokens in
input prompts using text NSFW classifiers during inference, and
PromptSan-Suffix, which trains an optimized suffix token sequence to neutralize
harmful intent while passing both text and image NSFW classifier checks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that PromptSan achieves state-of-the-art
performance in reducing harmful content generation across multiple metrics,
effectively balancing safety and usability.

Motivation: 现有3D生成模型生成的内容可能不符合人类主观偏好或任务需求，且依赖2D文本到图像模型，缺乏对3D结构的理解。

Method: 提出了一种端到端的可微分偏好学习框架，通过几何感知的奖励函数反向传播人类偏好，优化3D生成流程。

Result: 通过四种新的几何感知奖励函数验证了框架的有效性，实现了更可控和可解释的高质量3D内容生成。

Conclusion: 该框架为从自然语言生成高质量3D内容提供了更可控和可解释的途径。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D generative models have achieved impressive results but
3D contents generated by these models may not align with subjective human
preferences or task-specific criteria. Moreover, a core challenge in the 3D
texture generation domain remains: most existing approaches rely on repeated
calls to 2D text-to-image generative models, which lack an inherent
understanding of the 3D structure of the input 3D mesh object. To address this,
we propose an end-to-end differentiable preference learning framework that
back-propagates human preferences, represented by differentiable reward
functions, through the entire 3D generative pipeline, making the process
inherently geometry-aware. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework
using four proposed novel geometry-aware reward functions, offering a more
controllable and interpretable pathway for high-quality 3D content creation
from natural language.

Motivation: 现有基于Transformer和CNN的方法在医学图像分割中因染色和形态变化难以提取特征，且端到端方法在有限样本下表现不佳。

Result: 在四个数据集上实验表明，方法优于现有SOTA方法，性能提升显著（如MoNuSeg提升2.76%）。

Conclusion: 新方法通过高效特征整合和解码器设计，显著提升了医学图像分割的准确性。

Abstract: Segmenting biomarkers in medical images is crucial for various biotech
applications. Despite advances, Transformer and CNN based methods often
struggle with variations in staining and morphology, limiting feature
extraction. In medical image segmentation, where datasets often have limited
sample availability, recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods achieve higher
accuracy by leveraging pre-trained encoders, whereas end-to-end methods tend to
underperform. This is due to challenges in effectively transferring rich
multiscale features from encoders to decoders, as well as limitations in
decoder efficiency. To address these issues, we propose an architecture that
captures multi-scale local and global contextual information and a novel
decoder design, which effectively integrates features from the encoder,
emphasizes important channels and regions, and reconstructs spatial dimensions
to enhance segmentation accuracy. Our method, compatible with various encoders,
outperforms SOTA methods, as demonstrated by experiments on four datasets and
ablation studies. Specifically, our method achieves absolute performance gains
of 2.76% on MoNuSeg, 3.12% on DSB, 2.87% on Electron Microscopy, and 4.03% on
TNBC datasets compared to existing SOTA methods. Code:

TL;DR: 提出BSMamba模型，通过亮度与语义引导的注意力机制，解决低光图像增强中亮度恢复与语义一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有低光图像增强方法难以同时提升亮度并保持语义一致性和细节，且视觉Mamba模型因固定扫描规则限制了长距离依赖捕捉。

Method: BSMamba包含亮度Mamba和语义Mamba，分别基于亮度与语义相似性建模token交互，突破传统扫描模式限制。

Result: 实验表明BSMamba在低光图像增强任务中达到最优性能，同时保持语义一致性。

Conclusion: BSMamba通过亮度与语义引导的注意力机制，显著提升了低光图像增强的性能与语义保持能力。

Abstract: Current low-light image enhancement (LLIE) methods face significant
limitations in simultaneously improving brightness while preserving semantic
consistency, fine details, and computational efficiency. With the emergence of
state-space models, particularly Mamba, image restoration has achieved
remarkable performance, yet existing visual Mamba approaches flatten 2D images
into 1D token sequences using fixed scanning rules, critically limiting
interactions between distant tokens with causal relationships and constraining
their ability to capture meaningful long-range dependencies. To address these
fundamental limitations, we propose BSMamba, a novel visual Mamba architecture
comprising two specially designed components: Brightness Mamba and Semantic
Mamba. The Brightness Mamba revolutionizes token interaction patterns by
prioritizing connections between distant tokens with similar brightness levels,
effectively addressing the challenge of brightness restoration in LLIE tasks
through brightness-guided selective attention. Complementing this, the Semantic
Mamba establishes priority interactions between tokens sharing similar semantic
meanings, allowing the model to maintain contextual consistency by connecting
semantically related regions across the image, thus preserving the hierarchical
nature of image semantics during enhancement. By intelligently modeling tokens
based on brightness and semantic similarity rather than arbitrary scanning
patterns, BSMamba transcends the constraints of conventional token sequencing
while adhering to the principles of causal modeling. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BSMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in LLIE while
preserving semantic consistency.

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效提升分类性能。

Conclusion: 结合频域信息的方法在少样本学习中具有显著优势。

Abstract: The objective of Few-shot learning is to fully leverage the limited data
resources for exploring the latent correlations within the data by applying
algorithms and training a model with outstanding performance that can
adequately meet the demands of practical applications. In practical
applications, the number of images in each category is usually less than that
in traditional deep learning, which can lead to over-fitting and poor
generalization performance. Currently, many Few-shot classification models pay
more attention to spatial domain information while neglecting frequency domain
information, which contains more feature information. Ignoring frequency domain
information will prevent the model from fully exploiting feature information,
which would effect the classification performance. Based on conventional data
augmentation, this paper proposes an SFIFNet with innovative data
preprocessing. The key of this method is enhancing the accuracy of image
feature representation by integrating frequency domain information with spatial
domain information. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
this method in enhancing classification performance.

Motivation: 在医疗监控、工作场所安全和公共监控等安全关键应用中，检测异常行为至关重要，异常常表现为不寻常的人体姿态。

Method: 通过自回归因子化在关键点级别建模骨架序列密度，利用条件高斯分布预测关键点位置，低密度标志异常。

Result: 在UBnormal、MSAD-HR数据集上优于所有现有方法，在ShanghaiTech数据集上表现竞争性。

Conclusion: SeeKer方法简单有效，在异常检测任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Detecting anomalous human behaviour is an important visual task in
safety-critical applications such as healthcare monitoring, workplace safety,
or public surveillance. In these contexts, abnormalities are often reflected
with unusual human poses. Thus, we propose SeeKer, a method for detecting
anomalies in sequences of human skeletons. Our method formulates the skeleton
sequence density through autoregressive factorization at the keypoint level.
The corresponding conditional distributions represent probable keypoint
locations given prior skeletal motion. We formulate the joint distribution of
the considered skeleton as causal prediction of conditional Gaussians across
its constituent keypoints. A skeleton is flagged as anomalous if its keypoint
locations surprise our model (i.e. receive a low density). In practice, our
anomaly score is a weighted sum of per-keypoint log-conditionals, where the
weights account for the confidence of the underlying keypoint detector. Despite
its conceptual simplicity, SeeKer surpasses all previous methods on the
UBnormal and MSAD-HR datasets while delivering competitive performance on the
ShanghaiTech dataset.

Result: 该方法显著提升了MLLMs的视觉识别和个性化生成能力，在多概念图像描述任务中表现优于现有SFT基线。

Conclusion: RL框架有效解决了数据依赖问题，为MLLMs的个性化图像描述提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to generate
personalized image captions, even when trained on high-quality captions. In
this work, we observe that such limitations persist in existing
post-training-based MLLM personalization methods. Specifically, despite being
post-tuned with large-scale caption data through supervised fine-tuning (SFT),
these models frequently fail to produce faithful descriptions in real-world
scenarios, such as multi-concept image captioning. However, acquiring
large-scale, high-quality captions for such complex settings is both costly and
difficult. To address the data-centric nature of SFT, we propose a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training framework. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first RL-based approach to post-train MLLMs for
personalized image captioning. Our method significantly enhances both visual
recognition and personalized generation capabilities of MLLMs, and consistently
outperforms existing SFT-based baselines, especially in the challenging
multi-concept image captioning task.

Abstract: Recent benchmarks and datasets have been proposed to improve spatial

work, we introduce InternSpatial, the largest open-source dataset for spatial
reasoning in VLMs, along with InternSpatial-Bench, a corresponding evaluation
benchmark designed to assess spatial understanding under diverse instruction
formats. InternSpatial comprises 12 million QA pairs spanning both single-view
and multi-view settings, drawn from diverse visual environments and supporting
19 instruction formats that reflect varied query styles. For evaluation, we
propose InternSpatial-Bench for single-view tasks and expand multi-view
reasoning by introducing a novel rotation angle prediction task that has not
been explored in prior work. Experimental results show that models trained on
InternSpatial achieve 12.1% improvement on InternSpatial-Bench and 10.7% on

We hope these resources will support the development of spatially capable VLMs
in practical applications such as robotics and embodied AI.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法优于其他分布式多目标滤波器。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在分布式多目标滤波中具有优势，能够有效处理PMB密度的融合问题。

Abstract: This paper presents the distributed Poisson multi-Bernoulli (PMB) filter
based on the generalised covariance intersection (GCI) fusion rule for
distributed multi-object filtering. Since the exact GCI fusion of two PMB
densities is intractable, we derive a principled approximation. Specifically,
we approximate the power of a PMB density as an unnormalised PMB density, which
corresponds to an upper bound of the PMB density. Then, the GCI fusion rule
corresponds to the normalised product of two unnormalised PMB densities. We
show that the result is a Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM), which can be
expressed in closed form. Future prediction and update steps in each filter
preserve the PMBM form, which can be projected back to a PMB density before the
next fusion step. Experimental results show the benefits of this approach
compared to other distributed multi-object filters.

existing models provide only binary outputs, offering limited clinical insight.
This work introduces a novel approach that extends beyond classification,
enabling interpretable risk modelling through a Conditional Variational
Autoencoder. The proposed method learns a structured latent space that captures
semantic relationships among lesions, allowing for a nuanced, continuous
assessment of morphological differences. An SVM is also trained on this
representation effectively differentiating between benign nevi and melanomas,
demonstrating strong and consistent performance. More importantly, the learned
latent space supports visual and geometric interpretation of malignancy, with
the spatial proximity of a lesion to known melanomas serving as a meaningful
indicator of risk. This approach bridges predictive performance with clinical
applicability, fostering early detection, highlighting ambiguous cases, and
enhancing trust in AI-assisted diagnosis through transparent and interpretable
decision-making.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds significant promise for improving
prognosis prediction in medical imaging, yet its effective application remains
challenging. In this work, we introduce a structured benchmark explicitly
designed to evaluate and compare the transferability of Convolutional Neural
Networks and Foundation Models in predicting clinical outcomes in COVID-19
patients, leveraging diverse publicly available Chest X-ray datasets. Our
experimental methodology extensively explores a wide set of fine-tuning
strategies, encompassing traditional approaches such as Full Fine-Tuning and
Linear Probing, as well as advanced Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning methods
including Low-Rank Adaptation, BitFit, VeRA, and IA3. The evaluations were
conducted across multiple learning paradigms, including both extensive
full-data scenarios and more clinically realistic Few-Shot Learning settings,
which are critical for modeling rare disease outcomes and rapidly emerging
health threats. By implementing a large-scale comparative analysis involving a
diverse selection of pretrained models, including general-purpose architectures
pretrained on large-scale datasets such as CLIP and DINOv2, to
biomedical-specific models like MedCLIP, BioMedCLIP, and PubMedCLIP, we
rigorously assess each model's capacity to effectively adapt and generalize to
prognosis tasks, particularly under conditions of severe data scarcity and
pronounced class imbalance. The benchmark was designed to capture critical
conditions common in prognosis tasks, including variations in dataset size and
class distribution, providing detailed insights into the strengths and
limitations of each fine-tuning strategy. This extensive and structured
evaluation aims to inform the practical deployment and adoption of robust,
efficient, and generalizable AI-driven solutions in real-world clinical
prognosis prediction workflows.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在保留高频细节和全局语义方面表现优异，解决了现有Transformer方法的局限性。

Abstract: Image inpainting plays a vital role in restoring missing image regions and
supporting high-level vision tasks, but traditional methods struggle with
complex textures and large occlusions. Although Transformer-based approaches
have demonstrated strong global modeling capabilities, they often fail to
preserve high-frequency details due to the low-pass nature of self-attention
and suffer from high computational costs. To address these challenges, this
paper proposes a Transformer-based image inpainting method incorporating
frequency-domain fusion. Specifically, an attention mechanism combining wavelet
transform and Gabor filtering is introduced to enhance multi-scale structural
modeling and detail preservation. Additionally, a learnable frequency-domain
filter based on the fast Fourier transform is designed to replace the
feedforward network, enabling adaptive noise suppression and detail retention.
The model adopts a four-level encoder-decoder structure and is guided by a
novel loss strategy to balance global semantics and fine details. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves the quality
of image inpainting by preserving more high-frequency information.

Conclusion: CPAM是一种高效、零样本的图像编辑框架，能够处理复杂非刚性对象并保留背景细节。

Abstract: Editing natural images using textual descriptions in text-to-image diffusion
models remains a significant challenge, particularly in achieving consistent
generation and handling complex, non-rigid objects. Existing methods often
struggle to preserve textures and identity, require extensive fine-tuning, and
exhibit limitations in editing specific spatial regions or objects while
retaining background details. This paper proposes Context-Preserving Adaptive
Manipulation (CPAM), a novel zero-shot framework for complicated, non-rigid
real image editing. Specifically, we propose a preservation adaptation module
that adjusts self-attention mechanisms to preserve and independently control
the object and background effectively. This ensures that the objects' shapes,
textures, and identities are maintained while keeping the background
undistorted during the editing process using the mask guidance technique.
Additionally, we develop a localized extraction module to mitigate the
interference with the non-desired modified regions during conditioning in
cross-attention mechanisms. We also introduce various mask-guidance strategies
to facilitate diverse image manipulation tasks in a simple manner. Extensive
experiments on our newly constructed Image Manipulation BenchmArk (IMBA), a
robust benchmark dataset specifically designed for real image editing,
demonstrate that our proposed method is the preferred choice among human
raters, outperforming existing state-of-the-art editing techniques.

Result: DIP在多种下游场景理解任务中表现优异，计算高效（单A100 GPU不到9小时）。

Conclusion: DIP为密集图像表示提供了一种简单、高效且实用的改进方案。

Abstract: We introduce DIP, a novel unsupervised post-training method designed to
enhance dense image representations in large-scale pretrained vision encoders
for in-context scene understanding. Unlike prior approaches that rely on
complex self-distillation architectures, our method trains the vision encoder
using pseudo-tasks that explicitly simulate downstream in-context scenarios,
inspired by meta-learning principles. To enable post-training on unlabeled
data, we propose an automatic mechanism for generating in-context tasks that
combines a pretrained diffusion model and the vision encoder itself. DIP is
simple, unsupervised, and computationally efficient, requiring less than 9
hours on a single A100 GPU. By learning dense representations through pseudo
in-context tasks, it achieves strong performance across a wide variety of
downstream real-world in-context scene understanding tasks. It outperforms both
the initial vision encoder and prior methods, offering a practical and
effective solution for improving dense representations. Code available here:

Result: 实验表明，现有模型在时间感知上表现不佳，而AViLA显著提升了准确性和时间感知能力。

Conclusion: AViLA为流数据交互提供了一种有效的解决方案，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: An ideal vision-language agent serves as a bridge between the human users and
their surrounding physical world in real-world applications like autonomous
driving and embodied agents, and proactively provides accurate and timely
responses given user intents. An intriguing challenge arises when agents
interact with the world as a dynamic data stream and ad-hoc queries from users:
supporting knowledge for queries, namely evidence, usually appears
asynchronously with the arrival time of queries, and agents need to ground
their responses in historical data, present observations, and even future
streams. We frame this challenge as Query-Evidence Asynchrony, where user
queries and their supporting evidence typically arrive asynchronously in the
streaming setting. This setting requires not only strong reasoning capabilities
but also the ability to retain past observations and respond to queries with
temporal awareness. In this paper, we introduce a diagnostic benchmark that
evaluates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on their ability to handle
interaction with streaming data. Further, we present AViLA, Asynchronous
Video-Language Agent for streaming data interaction that can handle ad-hoc
queries and give time-aware responses. For this purpose, AViLA consists of
three key modules: comprehensive memory retention, evidence identification, and
evidence-grounded trigger, that are designed to maintain a general-purpose
memory and respond readily and timely to queries. Our experiments show that
existing models often fail to respond at appropriate times, while AViLA
significantly improves both accuracy and temporal awareness. Our code and
dataset will be publicly available.

Motivation: 现有方法忽视了通过扰动查询上下文生成强监督信号的重要性，导致性能受限。

Method: 采用师生学习框架，学生模型输入强增强样本（句子被移除），从教师模型获取强监督信号；随后基于伪标签重新训练模型，利用原始视图与增强视图预测的一致性作为标签置信度。

Result: 实验表明，CCL显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CCL通过统一一致性正则化和伪标签技术，有效提升了半监督视频段落定位的性能。

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Video Paragraph Grounding (SSVPG) aims to localize multiple
sentences in a paragraph from an untrimmed video with limited temporal
annotations. Existing methods focus on teacher-student consistency learning and
video-level contrastive loss, but they overlook the importance of perturbing
query contexts to generate strong supervisory signals. In this work, we propose
a novel Context Consistency Learning (CCL) framework that unifies the paradigms
of consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling to enhance semi-supervised
learning. Specifically, we first conduct teacher-student learning where the
student model takes as inputs strongly-augmented samples with sentences removed
and is enforced to learn from the adequately strong supervisory signals from
the teacher model. Afterward, we conduct model retraining based on the
generated pseudo labels, where the mutual agreement between the original and
augmented views' predictions is utilized as the label confidence. Extensive
experiments show that CCL outperforms existing methods by a large margin.

Motivation: 解决H&E-HER2染色转换任务中缺乏公开数据集和模型性能不明确的问题。

Result: GANs整体表现优于DMs，BBDM表现接近；数据对齐显著提升模型效果。

Conclusion: 研究提供了高质量数据集和模型性能比较，为相关研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Virtual staining is a promising technique that uses deep generative models to
recreate histological stains, providing a faster and more cost-effective
alternative to traditional tissue chemical staining. Specifically for H&E-HER2
staining transfer, despite a rising trend in publications, the lack of
sufficient public datasets has hindered progress in the topic. Additionally, it
is currently unclear which model frameworks perform best for this particular
task. In this paper, we introduce the HER2match dataset, the first publicly
available dataset with the same breast cancer tissue sections stained with both
H&E and HER2. Furthermore, we compare the performance of several Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs), and implement a novel
Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model for H&E-HER2 translation. Our findings indicate
that, overall, GANs perform better than DMs, with only the BBDM achieving
comparable results. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of data alignment,
as all models trained on HER2match produced vastly improved visuals compared to
the widely used consecutive-slide BCI dataset. This research provides a new
high-quality dataset ([available upon publication acceptance]), improving both
model training and evaluation. In addition, our comparison of frameworks offers
valuable guidance for researchers working on the topic.

Conclusion: ShowFlow为可控图像合成提供了高效解决方案，尤其在多概念生成中表现出色。

Abstract: Customizing image generation remains a core challenge in controllable image
synthesis. For single-concept generation, maintaining both identity
preservation and prompt alignment is challenging. In multi-concept scenarios,
relying solely on a prompt without additional conditions like layout boxes or
semantic masks, often leads to identity loss and concept omission. In this
paper, we introduce ShowFlow, a comprehensive framework designed to tackle
these challenges. We propose ShowFlow-S for single-concept image generation,
and ShowFlow-M for handling multiple concepts. ShowFlow-S introduces a
KronA-WED adapter, which integrates a Kronecker adapter with weight and
embedding decomposition, and employs a disentangled learning approach with a
novel attention regularization objective to enhance single-concept generation.
Building on this foundation, ShowFlow-M directly reuses the learned models from
ShowFlow-S to support multi-concept generation without extra conditions,
incorporating a Subject-Adaptive Matching Attention (SAMA) and a layout
consistency strategy as the plug-and-play module. Extensive experiments and
user studies validate ShowFlow's effectiveness, highlighting its potential in
real-world applications like advertising and virtual dressing.

<details>

Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏在长尾数据分布中表现不佳，因为教师模型对头类有偏见，对尾类的监督有限。

Method: 将标准KD目标分解为组间和组内KL散度，引入重新平衡的组间损失和均匀的组内损失。

Result: 在多个数据集上，LTKD显著优于现有KD方法，整体准确率和尾类性能均有提升。

Conclusion: LTKD能够有效从有偏见的教师模型中转移知识，适用于资源受限和不平衡的实际场景。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a widely adopted model compression technique
where a compact student model learns from the output of a larger, pre-trained
teacher. While effective in balanced settings, conventional KD suffers
significantly when applied to long-tailed data distributions, as the teacher
model tends to be biased toward head classes and provides limited supervision
for tail classes. In this paper, we propose Long-Tailed Knowledge Distillation
(LTKD), a novel framework tailored for class-imbalanced scenarios. We begin by
reformulating the standard KD objective into two components: inter-group and
intra-group Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, corresponding to the prediction
distributions across and within class groups (head, medium, tail),
respectively. This decomposition allows us to identify and quantify the sources
of teacher bias. To address them, we introduce (1) a rebalanced inter-group
loss that calibrates the teacher's group-level predictions and (2) a uniform
intra-group loss that ensures equal contribution from all groups during
distillation. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100-LT, TinyImageNet-LT, and
ImageNet-LT show that LTKD consistently outperforms existing KD methods,
achieving significant gains in both overall accuracy and tail-class
performance. Our results demonstrate that LTKD enables effective knowledge
transfer even from biased teachers, making it a strong candidate for real-world
deployment in resource-constrained and imbalanced settings.

Abstract: Recently, vision-language pretraining has emerged as a transformative
technique that integrates the strengths of both visual and textual modalities,
resulting in powerful vision-language models (VLMs). Leveraging web-scale
pretraining data, these models exhibit strong zero-shot capabilities. However,
their performance often deteriorates when confronted with domain-specific or
specialized generalization tasks. To address this, a growing body of research
focuses on transferring or generalizing the rich knowledge embedded in VLMs to
various downstream applications. This survey aims to comprehensively summarize
the generalization settings, methodologies, benchmarking and results in VLM
literatures. Delving into the typical VLM structures, current literatures are
categorized into prompt-based, parameter-based and feature-based methods
according to the transferred modules. The differences and characteristics in
each category are furthered summarized and discussed by revisiting the typical
transfer learning (TL) settings, providing novel interpretations for TL in the
era of VLMs. Popular benchmarks for VLM generalization are further introduced
with thorough performance comparisons among the reviewed methods. Following the
advances in large-scale generalizable pretraining, this survey also discusses
the relations and differences between VLMs and up-to-date multimodal large
language models (MLLM), e.g., DeepSeek-VL. By systematically reviewing the
surging literatures in vision-language research from a novel and practical
generalization prospective, this survey contributes to a clear landscape of
current and future multimodal researches.

Abstract: Translation equivariance is a fundamental inductive bias in image
restoration, ensuring that translated inputs produce translated outputs.
Attention mechanisms in modern restoration transformers undermine this
property, adversely impacting both training convergence and generalization. To
alleviate this issue, we propose two key strategies for incorporating
translation equivariance: slide indexing and component stacking. Slide indexing
maintains operator responses at fixed positions, with sliding window attention
being a notable example, while component stacking enables the arrangement of
translation-equivariant operators in parallel or sequentially, thereby building
complex architectures while preserving translation equivariance. However, these
strategies still create a dilemma in model design between the high
computational cost of self-attention and the fixed receptive field associated
with sliding window attention. To address this, we develop an adaptive sliding
indexing mechanism to efficiently select key-value pairs for each query, which
are then concatenated in parallel with globally aggregated key-value pairs. The
designed network, called the Translation Equivariance Adaptive Transformer
(TEAFormer), is assessed across a variety of image restoration tasks. The
results highlight its superiority in terms of effectiveness, training
convergence, and generalization.

Abstract: Generating multi-view images from human instructions is crucial for 3D
content creation. The primary challenges involve maintaining consistency across
multiple views and effectively synthesizing shapes and textures under diverse
conditions. In this paper, we propose the Multi-View Auto-Regressive (MV-AR)
method, which leverages an auto-regressive model to progressively generate
consistent multi-view images from arbitrary prompts. Firstly, the
next-token-prediction capability of the AR model significantly enhances its
effectiveness in facilitating progressive multi-view synthesis. When generating
widely-separated views, MV-AR can utilize all its preceding views to extract
effective reference information. Subsequently, we propose a unified model that
accommodates various prompts via architecture designing and training
strategies. To address multiple conditions, we introduce condition injection
modules for text, camera pose, image, and shape. To manage multi-modal
conditions simultaneously, a progressive training strategy is employed. This
strategy initially adopts the text-to-multi-view (t2mv) model as a baseline to
enhance the development of a comprehensive X-to-multi-view (X2mv) model through
the randomly dropping and combining conditions. Finally, to alleviate the
overfitting problem caused by limited high-quality data, we propose the
"Shuffle View" data augmentation technique, thus significantly expanding the
training data by several magnitudes. Experiments demonstrate the performance
and versatility of our MV-AR, which consistently generates consistent
multi-view images across a range of conditions and performs on par with leading
diffusion-based multi-view image generation models. Code and models will be

crucial semantic information. The proposed the \underline{h}yperbolic
\underline{s}et-\underline{to}-\underline{s}et \underline{d}istance measure
(HS2SD) integrates both global and local structural information: global
structure through geodesic distances between Einstein midpoints of hyperbolic
sets, and local structure through topological characteristics of the two sets.
To efficiently compute topological differences, we prove that using a finite
Thue-Morse sequence of degree and adjacency matrices can serve as a robust
approximation to capture the topological structure of a set. In this case, by
considering the topological differences, HS2SD provides a more nuanced
understanding of the relationships between two hyperbolic sets. Empirical
evaluation on entity matching, standard image classification, and few-shot
image classification demonstrates that our distance measure outperforms
existing methods by effectively modeling the hierarchical and complex
relationships inherent in hyperbolic sets.

Motivation: 现有双曲学习方法使用固定距离度量，假设数据层次结构均匀，但现实中的层次结构具有多样性，这种假设过于局限。

Method: 通过为每对数据点生成定制投影和曲率，动态调整距离度量；引入低秩分解方案和难对挖掘机制降低计算成本。

Result: 在图像分类、层次分类和少样本学习任务中表现优异，少样本学习任务中性能提升超过5%。

Conclusion: 自适应距离度量能更好地捕捉多样化的层次结构，可视化显示更清晰的类别边界和原型分离。

Abstract: Learning in hyperbolic spaces has attracted increasing attention due to its
superior ability to model hierarchical structures of data. Most existing
hyperbolic learning methods use fixed distance measures for all data, assuming
a uniform hierarchy across all data points. However, real-world hierarchical
structures exhibit significant diversity, making this assumption overly
restrictive. In this paper, we propose a geometry-aware distance measure in
hyperbolic spaces, which dynamically adapts to varying hierarchical structures.
Our approach derives the distance measure by generating tailored projections
and curvatures for each pair of data points, effectively mapping them to an
appropriate hyperbolic space. We introduce a revised low-rank decomposition
scheme and a hard-pair mining mechanism to mitigate the computational cost of
pair-wise distance computation without compromising accuracy. We present an
upper bound on the low-rank approximation error using Talagrand's concentration
inequality, ensuring theoretical robustness. Extensive experiments on standard
image classification (MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100), hierarchical
classification (5-level CIFAR-100), and few-shot learning tasks (mini-ImageNet,
tiered-ImageNet) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our approach
consistently outperforms learning methods that use fixed distance measures,
with notable improvements on few-shot learning tasks, where it achieves over
5\% gains on mini-ImageNet. The results reveal that adaptive distance measures
better capture diverse hierarchical structures, with visualization showing
clearer class boundaries and improved prototype separation in hyperbolic
spaces.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多语义融合的无监督异常检测方法，通过引入正常样本的多语义特征指导异常重建，显著提升了逻辑异常检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 逻辑异常检测比结构异常更具挑战性，现有方法通过低维瓶颈压缩输入，但逻辑异常的全局语义偏差仍可能通过瓶颈传播，导致解码器重建出误导性结果。

Method: 提出多语义融合网络，利用预训练视觉语言网络提取正常样本的全局语义，构建可学习的语义码本存储特征向量，融合多语义特征指导解码器重建。

Result: 在MVTec LOCO AD数据集上达到SOTA性能，pixel-sPRO提升5.7%，image-AUROC提升2.6%。

Conclusion: 通过引入正常样本的多语义特征，有效抑制了逻辑异常的传播，提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Recently, detecting logical anomalies is becoming a more challenging task
compared to detecting structural ones. Existing encoder decoder based methods
typically compress inputs into low-dimensional bottlenecks on the assumption
that the compression process can effectively suppress the transmission of
logical anomalies to the decoder. However, logical anomalies present a
particular difficulty because, while their local features often resemble normal
semantics, their global semantics deviate significantly from normal patterns.
Thanks to the generalisation capabilities inherent in neural networks, these
abnormal semantic features can propagate through low-dimensional bottlenecks.
This ultimately allows the decoder to reconstruct anomalous images with
misleading fidelity. To tackle the above challenge, we propose a novel
normality prior guided multi-semantic fusion network for unsupervised anomaly
detection. Instead of feeding the compressed bottlenecks to the decoder
directly, we introduce the multi-semantic features of normal samples into the
reconstruction process. To this end, we first extract abstract global semantics
of normal cases by a pre-trained vision-language network, then the learnable
semantic codebooks are constructed to store representative feature vectors of
normal samples by vector quantisation. Finally, the above multi-semantic
features are fused and employed as input to the decoder to guide the
reconstruction of anomalies to approximate normality. Extensive experiments are
conducted to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, and it achieves
the SOTA performance on the MVTec LOCO AD dataset with improvements of 5.7% in
pixel-sPRO and 2.6% in image-AUROC. The source code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的声源定位框架，通过生成细粒度语义信息区分发声物体与静默物体，并引入两种新的损失函数（OCA和ORI），显著提升了复杂场景中的定位性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂场景中难以准确区分发声物体与视觉相似的静默物体，主要依赖简单的视听对应关系，无法捕捉语义差异。

Method: 利用MLLMs生成详细上下文信息，明确区分发声前景物体与静默背景物体，并设计OCA和ORI两种损失函数进行优化。

Result: 在MUSIC和VGGSound数据集上的实验表明，该方法在单源和多源定位场景中均显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过细粒度语义信息和新型损失函数，有效解决了复杂场景中的声源定位问题。

Abstract: Audio-visual sound source localization task aims to spatially localize
sound-making objects within visual scenes by integrating visual and audio cues.
However, existing methods struggle with accurately localizing sound-making
objects in complex scenes, particularly when visually similar silent objects
coexist. This limitation arises primarily from their reliance on simple
audio-visual correspondence, which does not capture fine-grained semantic
differences between sound-making and silent objects. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel sound source localization framework leveraging
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate detailed contextual
information that explicitly distinguishes between sound-making foreground
objects and silent background objects. To effectively integrate this detailed
information, we introduce two novel loss functions: Object-aware Contrastive
Alignment (OCA) loss and Object Region Isolation (ORI) loss. Extensive
experimental results on MUSIC and VGGSound datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, significantly outperforming existing methods in
both single-source and multi-source localization scenarios. Code and generated
detailed contextual information are available at:

TL;DR: VQ-Insight是一种新型的推理式视觉语言模型框架，用于评估AI生成视频的质量，通过渐进式学习和多维度评分奖励，显著提升了视频生成任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI生成视频质量评估存在泛化能力有限、缺乏时间意识、依赖大规模标注数据等问题，需要更有效的评估方法。

Method: 提出VQ-Insight框架，结合图像质量预热、任务特定时间学习和联合优化，设计多维度评分、偏好比较和时间建模奖励。

Result: 实验表明VQ-Insight在多维度评分、偏好比较和自然视频评分中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VQ-Insight为视频生成任务提供了更高效的质量评估方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated content (AIGC) have led to the emergence of
powerful text-to-video generation models. Despite these successes, evaluating
the quality of AIGC-generated videos remains challenging due to limited
generalization, lack of temporal awareness, heavy reliance on large-scale
annotated datasets, and the lack of effective interaction with generation
models. Most current approaches rely on supervised finetuning of
vision-language models (VLMs), which often require large-scale annotated
datasets and tend to decouple understanding and generation. To address these
shortcomings, we propose VQ-Insight, a novel reasoning-style VLM framework for
AIGC video quality assessment. Our approach features: (1) a progressive video
quality learning scheme that combines image quality warm-up, general
task-specific temporal learning, and joint optimization with the video
generation model; (2) the design of multi-dimension scoring rewards, preference
comparison rewards, and temporal modeling rewards to enhance both
generalization and specialization in video quality evaluation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that VQ-Insight consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in preference comparison, multi-dimension scoring,
and natural video scoring, bringing significant improvements for video
generation tasks.

TL;DR: VisualChef是一种为烹饪场景生成上下文视觉辅助的方法，通过基于掩码的视觉定位简化对齐，并保持环境一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 烹饪过程中缺乏一致的视觉指导，现有方法依赖复杂的文本-视觉对齐和额外标注。

Method: VisualChef通过识别动作相关对象并分类，实现有针对性的修改，同时提出自动化管道提取高质量帧。

Result: 在三个第一人称视频数据集上的定量和定性评估显示，VisualChef优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VisualChef通过简化视觉-文本对齐和保持环境一致性，有效支持烹饪过程。

Abstract: Cooking requires not only following instructions but also understanding,
executing, and monitoring each step - a process that can be challenging without
visual guidance. Although recipe images and videos offer helpful cues, they
often lack consistency in focus, tools, and setup. To better support the
cooking process, we introduce VisualChef, a method for generating contextual
visual aids tailored to cooking scenarios. Given an initial frame and a
specified action, VisualChef generates images depicting both the action's
execution and the resulting appearance of the object, while preserving the
initial frame's environment. Previous work aims to integrate knowledge
extracted from large language models by generating detailed textual
descriptions to guide image generation, which requires fine-grained
visual-textual alignment and involves additional annotations. In contrast,
VisualChef simplifies alignment through mask-based visual grounding. Our key
insight is identifying action-relevant objects and classifying them to enable
targeted modifications that reflect the intended action and outcome while
maintaining a consistent environment. In addition, we propose an automated
pipeline to extract high-quality initial, action, and final state frames. We
evaluate VisualChef quantitatively and qualitatively on three egocentric video
datasets and show its improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 3D高斯基元方法在渲染速度和高级效果（如重光照和阴影）上仍存在不足，而网格模型表现更好。因此，研究旨在结合两者的优势。

Method: 使用2D三角形面片（2DTS）替代3D高斯基元，通过紧凑性参数直接训练光真实感网格。

Conclusion: 2DTS方法结合了连续体积建模和离散网格的优势，显著提升了渲染质量和速度。

Abstract: Differentiable rendering with 3D Gaussian primitives has emerged as a
powerful method for reconstructing high-fidelity 3D scenes from multi-view
images. While it offers improvements over NeRF-based methods, this
representation still encounters challenges with rendering speed and advanced
rendering effects, such as relighting and shadow rendering, compared to
mesh-based models. In this paper, we propose 2D Triangle Splatting (2DTS), a
novel method that replaces 3D Gaussian primitives with 2D triangle facelets.
This representation naturally forms a discrete mesh-like structure while
retaining the benefits of continuous volumetric modeling. By incorporating a
compactness parameter into the triangle primitives, we enable direct training
of photorealistic meshes. Our experimental results demonstrate that our
triangle-based method, in its vanilla version (without compactness tuning),
achieves higher fidelity compared to state-of-the-art Gaussian-based methods.
Furthermore, our approach produces reconstructed meshes with superior visual
quality compared to existing mesh reconstruction methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于重采样的数据增强策略，用于卫星图像时间序列的对比自监督学习，并在农业分类任务中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于卫星图像时间序列（SITS）中大量未标记数据和少量标记数据的矛盾，需要一种有效的自监督学习方法利用未标记数据。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的重采样增强策略，通过上采样时间序列并提取不重叠的子序列，同时保持时间覆盖。

Result: 在Sentinel-2图像的多个农业分类基准测试中，该方法优于常见的增强方法（如抖动、调整大小和掩码），并在S2-Agri100数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为遥感时间序列提供了一种简单而有效的对比学习增强策略。

Abstract: Given the abundance of unlabeled Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) and the
scarcity of labeled data, contrastive self-supervised pretraining emerges as a
natural tool to leverage this vast quantity of unlabeled data. However,
designing effective data augmentations for contrastive learning remains
challenging for time series. We introduce a novel resampling-based augmentation
strategy that generates positive pairs by upsampling time series and extracting
disjoint subsequences while preserving temporal coverage. We validate our
approach on multiple agricultural classification benchmarks using Sentinel-2
imagery, showing that it outperforms common alternatives such as jittering,
resizing, and masking. Further, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the
S2-Agri100 dataset without employing spatial information or temporal encodings,
surpassing more complex masked-based SSL frameworks. Our method offers a
simple, yet effective, contrastive learning augmentation for remote sensing
time series.

TL;DR: SpaNN是一种新型对抗攻击检测器，其计算复杂度与对抗补丁数量无关，通过构建二值化特征图集合并进行聚类来检测攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法主要针对单补丁攻击，对多补丁攻击效果不佳或计算成本高。

Method: SpaNN通过应用一组显著性阈值生成二值化特征图集合，进行聚类后输入分类器检测攻击。

Result: 在四个数据集上，SpaNN在目标检测和图像分类任务中分别比现有方法提升11%和27%。

Conclusion: SpaNN显著提升了对抗攻击检测的鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: State-of-the-art convolutional neural network models for object detection and
image classification are vulnerable to physically realizable adversarial
perturbations, such as patch attacks. Existing defenses have focused,
implicitly or explicitly, on single-patch attacks, leaving their sensitivity to
the number of patches as an open question or rendering them computationally
infeasible or inefficient against attacks consisting of multiple patches in the
worst cases. In this work, we propose SpaNN, an attack detector whose
computational complexity is independent of the expected number of adversarial
patches. The key novelty of the proposed detector is that it builds an ensemble
of binarized feature maps by applying a set of saliency thresholds to the
neural activations of the first convolutional layer of the victim model. It
then performs clustering on the ensemble and uses the cluster features as the
input to a classifier for attack detection. Contrary to existing detectors,
SpaNN does not rely on a fixed saliency threshold for identifying adversarial
regions, which makes it robust against white box adversarial attacks. We
evaluate SpaNN on four widely used data sets for object detection and
classification, and our results show that SpaNN outperforms state-of-the-art
defenses by up to 11 and 27 percentage points in the case of object detection
and the case of image classification, respectively. Our code is available at

Result: 在多个基准测试和人类评估中，RDPO在动作连贯性和物理真实性方面均有显著提升。

Conclusion: RDPO为视频生成中的物理一致性提供了一种高效且无需标注的解决方案。

Abstract: Video generation techniques have achieved remarkable advancements in visual
quality, yet faithfully reproducing real-world physics remains elusive.
Preference-based model post-training may improve physical consistency, but
requires costly human-annotated datasets or reward models that are not yet
feasible. To address these challenges, we present Real Data Preference
Optimisation (RDPO), an annotation-free framework that distills physical priors
directly from real-world videos. Specifically, the proposed RDPO
reverse-samples real video sequences with a pre-trained generator to
automatically build preference pairs that are statistically distinguishable in
terms of physical correctness. A multi-stage iterative training schedule then
guides the generator to obey physical laws increasingly well. Benefiting from
the dynamic information explored from real videos, our proposed RDPO
significantly improves the action coherence and physical realism of the
generated videos. Evaluations on multiple benchmarks and human evaluations have
demonstrated that RDPO achieves improvements across multiple dimensions. The

Abstract: Automated pathology report generation from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) faces
two key challenges: (1) lack of semantic content in visual features and (2)
inherent information redundancy in WSIs. To address these issues, we propose a
novel Historical Report Guided \textbf{Bi}-modal Concurrent Learning Framework
for Pathology Report \textbf{Gen}eration (BiGen) emulating pathologists'
diagnostic reasoning, consisting of: (1) A knowledge retrieval mechanism to
provide rich semantic content, which retrieves WSI-relevant knowledge from
pre-built medical knowledge bank by matching high-attention patches and (2) A
bi-modal concurrent learning strategy instantiated via a learnable visual token
and a learnable textual token to dynamically extract key visual features and
retrieved knowledge, where weight-shared layers enable cross-modal alignment
between visual features and knowledge features. Our multi-modal decoder
integrates both modals for comprehensive diagnostic reports generation.
Experiments on the PathText (BRCA) dataset demonstrate our framework's
superiority, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 7.4\% relative
improvement in NLP metrics and 19.1\% enhancement in classification metrics for

Conclusion: 新基准和FM-SI指标为评估组织病理学基础模型提供了有效工具，有助于提升模型在实际应用中的性能。

Abstract: Pretraining on large-scale, in-domain datasets grants histopathology
foundation models (FM) the ability to learn task-agnostic data representations,
enhancing transfer learning on downstream tasks. In computational pathology,
automated whole slide image analysis requires multiple instance learning (MIL)
frameworks due to the gigapixel scale of the slides. The diversity among
histopathology FMs has highlighted the need to design real-world challenges for
evaluating their effectiveness. To bridge this gap, our work presents a novel
benchmark for evaluating histopathology FMs as patch-level feature extractors
within a MIL classification framework. For that purpose, we leverage the
AI4SkIN dataset, a multi-center cohort encompassing slides with challenging
cutaneous spindle cell neoplasm subtypes. We also define the Foundation Model -
Silhouette Index (FM-SI), a novel metric to measure model consistency against
distribution shifts. Our experimentation shows that extracting less biased
features enhances classification performance, especially in similarity-based

Conclusion: MedSeg-R通过嵌入细粒度语义先验，有效解决了医学图像分割中的混淆问题，并展示了与SAM系统的兼容性。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is challenging due to overlapping anatomies with
ambiguous boundaries and a severe imbalance between the foreground and
background classes, which particularly affects the delineation of small
lesions. Existing methods, including encoder-decoder networks and prompt-driven
variants of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), rely heavily on local cues or
user prompts and lack integrated semantic priors, thus failing to generalize
well to low-contrast or overlapping targets. To address these issues, we
propose MedSeg-R, a lightweight, dual-stage framework inspired by inspired by
clinical reasoning. Its cognitive stage interprets medical report into
structured semantic priors (location, texture, shape), which are fused via
transformer block. In the perceptual stage, these priors modulate the SAM
backbone: spatial attention highlights likely lesion regions, dynamic
convolution adapts feature filters to expected textures, and deformable
sampling refines spatial support. By embedding this fine-grained guidance
early, MedSeg-R disentangles inter-class confusion and amplifies minority-class
cues, greatly improving sensitivity to small lesions. In challenging
benchmarks, MedSeg-R produces large Dice improvements in overlapping and
ambiguous structures, demonstrating plug-and-play compatibility with SAM-based
systems.

Result: 在五个医学影像数据集上表现出色，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: MARL-MambaContour是一种准确且鲁棒的临床分割工具。

Abstract: We introduce MARL-MambaContour, the first contour-based medical image
segmentation framework based on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). Our
approach reframes segmentation as a multi-agent cooperation task focused on
generate topologically consistent object-level contours, addressing the
limitations of traditional pixel-based methods which could lack topological
constraints and holistic structural awareness of anatomical regions. Each
contour point is modeled as an autonomous agent that iteratively adjusts its
position to align precisely with the target boundary, enabling adaptation to
blurred edges and intricate morphologies common in medical images. This
iterative adjustment process is optimized by a contour-specific Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, further enhanced with the Entropy Regularization
Adjustment Mechanism (ERAM) which dynamically balance agent exploration with
contour smoothness. Furthermore, the framework incorporates a Mamba-based
policy network featuring a novel Bidirectional Cross-attention Hidden-state
Fusion Mechanism (BCHFM). This mechanism mitigates potential memory confusion
limitations associated with long-range modeling in state space models, thereby
facilitating more accurate inter-agent information exchange and informed
decision-making. Extensive experiments on five diverse medical imaging datasets
demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of MARL-MambaContour, highlighting

Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) for enhanced environmental perception, particularly
in challenging weather and lighting conditions. However, efficiently processing
its high-dimensional spectral data remains a significant challenge. This paper
introduces a Multi-scale Spectral Attention Module (MSAM) that enhances
spectral feature extraction through three parallel 1D convolutions with varying
kernel sizes between 1 to 11, coupled with an adaptive feature aggregation
mechanism. By integrating MSAM into UNet's skip connections (UNet-SC), our
proposed UNet-MSAM achieves significant improvements in semantic segmentation
performance across multiple HSI datasets: HyKo-VIS v2, HSI-Drive v2, and
Hyperspectral City v2. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that with
minimal computational overhead (on average 0.02% in parameters and 0.82%
GFLOPS), UNet-MSAM consistently outperforms UNet-SC, achieving average
improvements of 3.61% in mean IoU and 3.80% in mF1 across the three datasets.
Through extensive ablation studies, we have established that multi-scale kernel
combinations perform better than single-scale configurations. These findings
demonstrate the potential of HSI processing for AD and provide valuable
insights into designing robust, multi-scale spectral feature extractors for
real-world applications.

TL;DR: SIM-Net是一种新型2D图像分类架构，通过将2D图像转换为3D点云，融合纹理和几何特征，提升分类性能，尤其在植物标本分类中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统2D图像分类模型在处理复杂背景、非植物元素和遮挡时表现不佳，SIM-Net通过引入3D几何特征来解决这些问题。

Method: SIM-Net通过像素到点的转换生成3D点云，结合CNN和PointNet编码器提取特征，并在统一潜在空间中进行融合。

Result: 在植物标本数据集上，SIM-Net比ResNet101准确率提升9.9%，F-score提升12.3%，且优于多种Transformer架构。

Conclusion: SIM-Net证明了将3D结构推理融入2D图像分类任务的有效性，尤其在复杂场景中表现突出。

Abstract: We introduce the Shape-Image Multimodal Network (SIM-Net), a novel 2D image
classification architecture that integrates 3D point cloud representations
inferred directly from RGB images. Our key contribution lies in a
pixel-to-point transformation that converts 2D object masks into 3D point
clouds, enabling the fusion of texture-based and geometric features for
enhanced classification performance. SIM-Net is particularly well-suited for
the classification of digitized herbarium specimens (a task made challenging by
heterogeneous backgrounds), non-plant elements, and occlusions that compromise
conventional image-based models. To address these issues, SIM-Net employs a
segmentation-based preprocessing step to extract object masks prior to 3D point
cloud generation. The architecture comprises a CNN encoder for 2D image
features and a PointNet-based encoder for geometric features, which are fused
into a unified latent space. Experimental evaluations on herbarium datasets
demonstrate that SIM-Net consistently outperforms ResNet101, achieving gains of
up to 9.9% in accuracy and 12.3% in F-score. It also surpasses several
transformer-based state-of-the-art architectures, highlighting the benefits of
incorporating 3D structural reasoning into 2D image classification tasks.

Abstract: We introduce Matrix-Game, an interactive world foundation model for
controllable game world generation. Matrix-Game is trained using a two-stage
pipeline that first performs large-scale unlabeled pretraining for environment
understanding, followed by action-labeled training for interactive video
generation. To support this, we curate Matrix-Game-MC, a comprehensive
Minecraft dataset comprising over 2,700 hours of unlabeled gameplay video clips
and over 1,000 hours of high-quality labeled clips with fine-grained keyboard
and mouse action annotations. Our model adopts a controllable image-to-world
generation paradigm, conditioned on a reference image, motion context, and user
actions. With over 17 billion parameters, Matrix-Game enables precise control
over character actions and camera movements, while maintaining high visual
quality and temporal coherence. To evaluate performance, we develop GameWorld
Score, a unified benchmark measuring visual quality, temporal quality, action
controllability, and physical rule understanding for Minecraft world
generation. Extensive experiments show that Matrix-Game consistently
outperforms prior open-source Minecraft world models (including Oasis and
MineWorld) across all metrics, with particularly strong gains in
controllability and physical consistency. Double-blind human evaluations
further confirm the superiority of Matrix-Game, highlighting its ability to
generate perceptually realistic and precisely controllable videos across
diverse game scenarios. To facilitate future research on interactive
image-to-world generation, we will open-source the Matrix-Game model weights
and the GameWorld Score benchmark at https://github.com/SkyworkAI/Matrix-Game.

Motivation: 解决生物特征一旦泄露无法撤销的问题，提出可撤销生物特征方案。

Method: 利用深度CNN生成多个识别能力相同但模板不兼容的模型，并探索ViT的适用性。

Result: CNN模型支持可撤销方案，ViT表现不如ResNet。

Conclusion: 深度CNN是实现可撤销生物特征的有效方法，ViT不适用。

Abstract: One common critique of biometric authentication is that if an individual's
biometric is compromised, then the individual has no recourse. The concept of
revocable biometrics was developed to address this concern. A biometric scheme
is revocable if an individual can have their current enrollment in the scheme
revoked, so that the compromised biometric template becomes worthless, and the
individual can re-enroll with a new template that has similar recognition
power. We show that modern deep CNN face matchers inherently allow for a robust
revocable biometric scheme. For a given state-of-the-art deep CNN backbone and
training set, it is possible to generate an unlimited number of distinct face
matcher models that have both (1) equivalent recognition power, and (2)
strongly incompatible biometric templates. The equivalent recognition power
extends to the point of generating impostor and genuine distributions that have
the same shape and placement on the similarity dimension, meaning that the
models can share a similarity threshold for a 1-in-10,000 false match rate. The
biometric templates from different model instances are so strongly incompatible
that the cross-instance similarity score for images of the same person is
typically lower than the same-instance similarity score for images of different
persons. That is, a stolen biometric template that is revoked is of less value
in attempting to match the re-enrolled identity than the average impostor
template. We also explore the feasibility of using a Vision Transformer (ViT)
backbone-based face matcher in the revocable biometric system proposed in this
work and demonstrate that it is less suitable compared to typical ResNet-based
deep CNN backbones.

Motivation: 当前评估生成3D模型的自动化指标与人类感知质量不一致，缺乏有效的评估方法。

Method: 3D Arena通过成对比较收集人类偏好数据，使用ELO排名系统和统计欺诈检测确保数据可靠性。

Result: 平台收集了123,243票，发现高斯溅射输出比网格模型有16.6 ELO优势，带纹理模型比无纹理模型有144.1 ELO优势。

Conclusion: 3D Arena成为生成3D模型的基准评估资源，并提出了改进评估方法的建议。

Abstract: Evaluating Generative 3D models remains challenging due to misalignment
between automated metrics and human perception of quality. Current benchmarks
rely on image-based metrics that ignore 3D structure or geometric measures that
fail to capture perceptual appeal and real-world utility. To address this gap,
we present 3D Arena, an open platform for evaluating image-to-3D generation
models through large-scale human preference collection using pairwise
comparisons.
  Since launching in June 2024, the platform has collected 123,243 votes from
8,096 users across 19 state-of-the-art models, establishing the largest human
preference evaluation for Generative 3D. We contribute the iso3d dataset of 100
evaluation prompts and demonstrate quality control achieving 99.75% user
authenticity through statistical fraud detection. Our ELO-based ranking system
provides reliable model assessment, with the platform becoming an established
evaluation resource.
  Through analysis of this preference data, we present insights into human
preference patterns. Our findings reveal preferences for visual presentation
features, with Gaussian splat outputs achieving a 16.6 ELO advantage over
meshes and textured models receiving a 144.1 ELO advantage over untextured
models. We provide recommendations for improving evaluation methods, including
multi-criteria assessment, task-oriented evaluation, and format-aware
comparison. The platform's community engagement establishes 3D Arena as a
benchmark for the field while advancing understanding of human-centered

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于超像素的补丁池化（SPPP）技术和轻量潜在注意力（LLA）模块，以降低Vision Transformers的计算和内存需求，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers在计算和内存资源上依赖严重，且任务特定迁移学习困难，这些问题源于计算密集的自注意力机制。

Method: 通过SPPP生成语义丰富的补丁嵌入，结合LLA模块引入潜在令牌，动态调整交叉注意力，减少时间和空间复杂度。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高了计算效率，同时性能与现有最佳方法相当。

Conclusion: 该方法为边缘部署提供了高效节能的Transformer解决方案。

Abstract: The evolution of Vision Transformers has led to their widespread adaptation
to different domains. Despite large-scale success, there remain significant
challenges including their reliance on extensive computational and memory
resources for pre-training on huge datasets as well as difficulties in
task-specific transfer learning. These limitations coupled with energy
inefficiencies mainly arise due to the computation-intensive self-attention
mechanism. To address these issues, we propose a novel Super-Pixel Based Patch
Pooling (SPPP) technique that generates context-aware, semantically rich, patch
embeddings to effectively reduce the architectural complexity and improve
efficiency. Additionally, we introduce the Light Latent Attention (LLA) module
in our pipeline by integrating latent tokens into the attention mechanism
allowing cross-attention operations to significantly reduce the time and space
complexity of the attention module. By leveraging the data-intuitive patch
embeddings coupled with dynamic positional encodings, our approach adaptively
modulates the cross-attention process to focus on informative regions while
maintaining the global semantic structure. This targeted attention improves
training efficiency and accelerates convergence. Notably, the SPPP module is
lightweight and can be easily integrated into existing transformer
architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed architecture
provides significant improvements in terms of computational efficiency while
achieving comparable results with the state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting
its potential for energy-efficient transformers suitable for edge deployment.

Motivation: 解决单目视频中动态物体新视角合成的挑战，特别是结构-运动解耦的模糊性和监督信号稀缺问题。

Method: 提出ViDAR框架，结合个性化扩散模型生成伪多视角监督，使用高斯溅射表示，并引入扩散感知损失函数和相机位姿优化策略。

Result: 在DyCheck基准测试中，ViDAR在视觉质量和几何一致性上优于所有现有方法，尤其在动态区域表现突出。

Conclusion: ViDAR通过扩散感知监督和几何对齐策略，显著提升了动态新视角合成的性能，为运动丰富场景的重建提供了新基准。

Abstract: Dynamic Novel View Synthesis aims to generate photorealistic views of moving
subjects from arbitrary viewpoints. This task is particularly challenging when
relying on monocular video, where disentangling structure from motion is
ill-posed and supervision is scarce. We introduce Video Diffusion-Aware
Reconstruction (ViDAR), a novel 4D reconstruction framework that leverages
personalised diffusion models to synthesise a pseudo multi-view supervision
signal for training a Gaussian splatting representation. By conditioning on
scene-specific features, ViDAR recovers fine-grained appearance details while
mitigating artefacts introduced by monocular ambiguity. To address the
spatio-temporal inconsistency of diffusion-based supervision, we propose a
diffusion-aware loss function and a camera pose optimisation strategy that
aligns synthetic views with the underlying scene geometry. Experiments on
DyCheck, a challenging benchmark with extreme viewpoint variation, show that
ViDAR outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines in visual quality and
geometric consistency. We further highlight ViDAR's strong improvement over
baselines on dynamic regions and provide a new benchmark to compare performance
in reconstructing motion-rich parts of the scene. Project page:

Conclusion: PicoSAM2证明了直接在相机上实现高效、可提示的分割是可行的，无需云端或主机处理。

Abstract: Real-time, on-device segmentation is critical for latency-sensitive and
privacy-aware applications like smart glasses and IoT devices. We introduce
PicoSAM2, a lightweight (1.3M parameters, 336M MACs) promptable segmentation
model optimized for edge and in-sensor execution, including the Sony IMX500. It
builds on a depthwise separable U-Net, with knowledge distillation and
fixed-point prompt encoding to learn from the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2).
On COCO and LVIS, it achieves 51.9% and 44.9% mIoU, respectively. The quantized
model (1.22MB) runs at 14.3 ms on the IMX500-achieving 86 MACs/cycle, making it
the only model meeting both memory and compute constraints for in-sensor
deployment. Distillation boosts LVIS performance by +3.5% mIoU and +5.1% mAP.
These results demonstrate that efficient, promptable segmentation is feasible
directly on-camera, enabling privacy-preserving vision without cloud or host
processing.

Abstract: We propose the first framework capable of computing a 4D spatio-temporal grid
of video frames and 3D Gaussian particles for each time step using a
feed-forward architecture. Our architecture has two main components, a 4D video
model and a 4D reconstruction model. In the first part, we analyze current 4D
video diffusion architectures that perform spatial and temporal attention
either sequentially or in parallel within a two-stream design. We highlight the
limitations of existing approaches and introduce a novel fused architecture
that performs spatial and temporal attention within a single layer. The key to
our method is a sparse attention pattern, where tokens attend to others in the
same frame, at the same timestamp, or from the same viewpoint. In the second
part, we extend existing 3D reconstruction algorithms by introducing a Gaussian
head, a camera token replacement algorithm, and additional dynamic layers and
training. Overall, we establish a new state of the art for 4D generation,
improving both visual quality and reconstruction capability.

Result: 实验表明，使用Phantom-Data训练显著提升了提示对齐和视觉质量，同时保持身份一致性。

Conclusion: Phantom-Data是首个通用跨配对主题到视频一致性数据集，有效解决了复制粘贴问题。

Abstract: Subject-to-video generation has witnessed substantial progress in recent
years. However, existing models still face significant challenges in faithfully
following textual instructions. This limitation, commonly known as the
copy-paste problem, arises from the widely used in-pair training paradigm. This
approach inherently entangles subject identity with background and contextual
attributes by sampling reference images from the same scene as the target
video. To address this issue, we introduce \textbf{Phantom-Data, the first
general-purpose cross-pair subject-to-video consistency dataset}, containing
approximately one million identity-consistent pairs across diverse categories.
Our dataset is constructed via a three-stage pipeline: (1) a general and
input-aligned subject detection module, (2) large-scale cross-context subject
retrieval from more than 53 million videos and 3 billion images, and (3)
prior-guided identity verification to ensure visual consistency under
contextual variation. Comprehensive experiments show that training with
Phantom-Data significantly improves prompt alignment and visual quality while
preserving identity consistency on par with in-pair baselines.

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation is key for robotic manipulation, enabling precise
object localization for tasks like grasping. We present RAG-6DPose, a
retrieval-augmented approach that leverages 3D CAD models as a knowledge base
by integrating both visual and geometric cues. Our RAG-6DPose roughly contains
three stages: 1) Building a Multi-Modal CAD Knowledge Base by extracting 2D
visual features from multi-view CAD rendered images and also attaching 3D
points; 2) Retrieving relevant CAD features from the knowledge base based on

Conclusion: 精心设计的时间推理和语义融合能充分发挥MLLMs在时空理解中的潜力。

Abstract: Satellite image time-series analysis demands fine-grained spatial-temporal
reasoning, which remains a challenge for existing multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). In this work, we study the capabilities of MLLMs on a novel
task that jointly targets temporal change understanding and future scene
generation, aiming to assess their potential for modeling complex multimodal
dynamics over time. We propose TAMMs, a Temporal-Aware Multimodal Model for
satellite image change understanding and forecasting, which enhances frozen
MLLMs with lightweight temporal modules for structured sequence encoding and
contextual prompting. To guide future image generation, TAMMs introduces a
Semantic-Fused Control Injection (SFCI) mechanism that adaptively combines
high-level semantic reasoning and structural priors within an enhanced
ControlNet. This dual-path conditioning enables temporally consistent and
semantically grounded image synthesis. Experiments demonstrate that TAMMs
outperforms strong MLLM baselines in both temporal change understanding and
future image forecasting tasks, highlighting how carefully designed temporal
reasoning and semantic fusion can unlock the full potential of MLLMs for
spatio-temporal understanding.

the latent space, enhancing lip-syncing across diverse scenes. To preserve the
capability for prompt-driven control of foundation models while effectively
incorporating audio features, we employ a LoRA-based training approach.
Extensive experiments show that OmniAvatar surpasses existing models in both

Abstract: In this work, we introduce OmniGen2, a versatile and open-source generative

including text-to-image, image editing, and in-context generation. Unlike
OmniGen v1, OmniGen2 features two distinct decoding pathways for text and image
modalities, utilizing unshared parameters and a decoupled image tokenizer. This
design enables OmniGen2 to build upon existing multimodal understanding models
without the need to re-adapt VAE inputs, thereby preserving the original text
generation capabilities. To facilitate the training of OmniGen2, we developed
comprehensive data construction pipelines, encompassing image editing and
in-context generation data. Additionally, we introduce a reflection mechanism
tailored for image generation tasks and curate a dedicated reflection dataset
based on OmniGen2. Despite its relatively modest parameter size, OmniGen2
achieves competitive results on multiple task benchmarks, including
text-to-image and image editing. To further evaluate in-context generation,
also referred to as subject-driven tasks, we introduce a new benchmark named
OmniContext. OmniGen2 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source

Conclusion: MVAA框架在自动视频编辑中表现出高效性和灵活性。

Abstract: Aligning the rhythm of visual motion in a video with a given music track is a
practical need in multimedia production, yet remains an underexplored task in
autonomous video editing. Effective alignment between motion and musical beats
enhances viewer engagement and visual appeal, particularly in music videos,
promotional content, and cinematic editing. Existing methods typically depend
on labor-intensive manual cutting, speed adjustments, or heuristic-based
editing techniques to achieve synchronization. While some generative models
handle joint video and music generation, they often entangle the two
modalities, limiting flexibility in aligning video to music beats while
preserving the full visual content. In this paper, we propose a novel and
efficient framework, termed MVAA (Music-Video Auto-Alignment), that
automatically edits video to align with the rhythm of a given music track while
preserving the original visual content. To enhance flexibility, we modularize
the task into a two-step process in our MVAA: aligning motion keyframes with
audio beats, followed by rhythm-aware video inpainting. Specifically, we first
insert keyframes at timestamps aligned with musical beats, then use a
frame-conditioned diffusion model to generate coherent intermediate frames,
preserving the original video's semantic content. Since comprehensive test-time
training can be time-consuming, we adopt a two-stage strategy: pretraining the
inpainting module on a small video set to learn general motion priors, followed
by rapid inference-time fine-tuning for video-specific adaptation. This hybrid
approach enables adaptation within 10 minutes with one epoch on a single NVIDIA
4090 GPU using CogVideoX-5b-I2V as the backbone. Extensive experiments show
that our approach can achieve high-quality beat alignment and visual
smoothness.

TL;DR: 通用光度立体（PS）旨在从任意光照条件下的物体中恢复高质量表面法线，但面临光照与表面法线特征深度耦合及高频几何细节保留的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决通用光度立体中光照与表面法线特征的深度耦合问题，以及复杂表面上高频几何细节的保留问题。

Method: 不依赖特定光照模型，通过处理光照变化与表面法线的耦合关系，并优化特征处理操作以捕捉复杂几何细节。

Result: 尽管有SDM-UniPS和Uni MS-PS等进展，但仍存在光照与法线特征耦合及高频细节保留的挑战。

Conclusion: 通用光度立体需进一步解决光照与法线特征的耦合问题，并改进复杂几何细节的捕捉方法。

Abstract: Universal photometric stereo (PS) aims to recover high-quality surface
normals from objects under arbitrary lighting conditions without relying on
specific illumination models. Despite recent advances such as SDM-UniPS and Uni
MS-PS, two fundamental challenges persist: 1) the deep coupling between varying
illumination and surface normal features, where ambiguity in observed intensity
makes it difficult to determine whether brightness variations stem from
lighting changes or surface orientation; and 2) the preservation of
high-frequency geometric details in complex surfaces, where intricate
geometries create self-shadowing, inter-reflections, and subtle normal
variations that conventional feature processing operations struggle to capture
accurately.

Motivation: 现有方法局限于特定视频领域或时长，无法处理多样化视频和复杂语言查询。

Method: 结合时间戳标记与视频标记，通过自适应帧缩放处理不同时长视频，利用MLLMs进行时间定位。

Result: 在五个公开基准测试中，UniTime在零样本和微调设置下均优于现有方法，并显著提升长视频问答的准确性。

Conclusion: UniTime是一种通用且鲁棒的视频时间定位模型，适用于复杂视频理解任务。

Abstract: This paper presents a computational model for universal video temporal
grounding, which accurately localizes temporal moments in videos based on
natural language queries (e.g., questions or descriptions). Unlike existing
methods that are often limited to specific video domains or durations, we
propose UniTime, a robust and universal video grounding model leveraging the
strong vision-language understanding capabilities of generative Multi-modal
Large Language Models (MLLMs). Our model effectively handles videos of diverse
views, genres, and lengths while comprehending complex language queries. The
key contributions include: (i) We consider steering strong MLLMs for temporal
grounding in videos. To enable precise timestamp outputs, we incorporate
temporal information by interleaving timestamp tokens with video tokens. (ii)
By training the model to handle videos with different input granularities
through adaptive frame scaling, our approach achieves robust temporal grounding
for both short and long videos. (iii) Comprehensive experiments show that
UniTime outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both zero-shot and
dataset-specific finetuned settings across five public temporal grounding
benchmarks. (iv) When employed as a preliminary moment retriever for long-form
video question-answering (VideoQA), UniTime significantly improves VideoQA
accuracy, highlighting its value for complex video understanding tasks.

Motivation: 探索如何通过4D预训练学习通用的时空表示，以从少量视角和时间点的输入重建任意视角和时间的对象。

Method: 4D-LRM通过学习统一的时空表示，直接从跨时间的姿态图像标记预测每像素的4D高斯基元，支持快速、高质量的渲染。

Conclusion: 研究表明，扩展时空预训练能够实现准确且高效的4D重建，4D-LRM在泛化性和效率方面表现出色。

Abstract: Can we scale 4D pretraining to learn general space-time representations that
reconstruct an object from a few views at some times to any view at any time?
We provide an affirmative answer with 4D-LRM, the first large-scale 4D
reconstruction model that takes input from unconstrained views and timestamps
and renders arbitrary novel view-time combinations. Unlike prior 4D approaches,
e.g., optimization-based, geometry-based, or generative, that struggle with
efficiency, generalization, or faithfulness, 4D-LRM learns a unified space-time
representation and directly predicts per-pixel 4D Gaussian primitives from
posed image tokens across time, enabling fast, high-quality rendering at, in
principle, infinite frame rate. Our results demonstrate that scaling
spatiotemporal pretraining enables accurate and efficient 4D reconstruction. We
show that 4D-LRM generalizes to novel objects, interpolates across time, and
handles diverse camera setups. It reconstructs 24-frame sequences in one
forward pass with less than 1.5 seconds on a single A100 GPU.

Motivation: 旨在通过统一的表示空间实现跨模态输入输出，避免模态特定设计，提升多模态模型的效率和性能。

Method: 采用TA-Tok将图像转换为离散标记，结合两种去标记器（自回归和扩散模型）生成高质量视觉输出，并研究高级预训练任务以增强模态融合。

Result: 实验表明，Tar在多模态LLM方法中表现优异，收敛更快且训练效率更高。

Conclusion: Tar框架成功统一了视觉与文本表示，为多模态任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a multimodal framework that attempts to unify visual
understanding and generation within a shared discrete semantic representation.
At its core is the Text-Aligned Tokenizer (TA-Tok), which converts images into
discrete tokens using a text-aligned codebook projected from a large language
model's (LLM) vocabulary. By integrating vision and text into a unified space
with an expanded vocabulary, our multimodal LLM, Tar, enables cross-modal input
and output through a shared interface, without the need for modality-specific
designs. Additionally, we propose scale-adaptive encoding and decoding to
balance efficiency and visual detail, along with a generative de-tokenizer to
produce high-fidelity visual outputs. To address diverse decoding needs, we
utilize two complementary de-tokenizers: a fast autoregressive model and a
diffusion-based model. To enhance modality fusion, we investigate advanced
pre-training tasks, demonstrating improvements in both visual understanding and
generation. Experiments across benchmarks show that Tar matches or surpasses
existing multimodal LLM methods, achieving faster convergence and greater
training efficiency. Code, models, and data are available at

TL;DR: FilMaster是一个端到端的AI系统，通过整合真实世界的电影制作原则，生成专业级电影内容，解决了现有系统在镜头语言和节奏上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI电影生成系统缺乏多样化的镜头语言和电影节奏，导致视觉效果模板化和叙事不吸引人。FilMaster旨在解决这些问题。

Method: FilMaster采用两阶段设计：参考引导生成阶段和生成后制作阶段，结合多镜头协同RAG模块和观众为中心的节奏控制模块。

Result: 实验表明FilMaster在镜头语言设计和节奏控制上表现优异，推动了生成式AI在专业电影制作中的应用。

Conclusion: FilMaster通过整合电影制作原则和生成式AI模型，显著提升了AI生成电影的专业性和吸引力。

Abstract: AI-driven content creation has shown potential in film production. However,
existing film generation systems struggle to implement cinematic principles and
thus fail to generate professional-quality films, particularly lacking diverse
camera language and cinematic rhythm. This results in templated visuals and
unengaging narratives. To address this, we introduce FilMaster, an end-to-end
AI system that integrates real-world cinematic principles for
professional-grade film generation, yielding editable, industry-standard
outputs. FilMaster is built on two key principles: (1) learning cinematography
from extensive real-world film data and (2) emulating professional,
audience-centric post-production workflows. Inspired by these principles,
FilMaster incorporates two stages: a Reference-Guided Generation Stage which
transforms user input to video clips, and a Generative Post-Production Stage
which transforms raw footage into audiovisual outputs by orchestrating visual
and auditory elements for cinematic rhythm. Our generation stage highlights a
Multi-shot Synergized RAG Camera Language Design module to guide the AI in
generating professional camera language by retrieving reference clips from a
vast corpus of 440,000 film clips. Our post-production stage emulates
professional workflows by designing an Audience-Centric Cinematic Rhythm
Control module, including Rough Cut and Fine Cut processes informed by
simulated audience feedback, for effective integration of audiovisual elements
to achieve engaging content. The system is empowered by generative AI models
like (M)LLMs and video generation models. Furthermore, we introduce FilmEval, a
comprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI-generated films. Extensive
experiments show FilMaster's superior performance in camera language design and
cinematic rhythm control, advancing generative AI in professional filmmaking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 故事可视化中，保持角色和对象的视觉一致性是一个关键挑战，现有方法常导致叙事不连贯。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，通过迭代循环自主识别、修正和优化不一致性，支持多种扩散模型。

Result: 定量和定性实验表明，该方法在多面板一致性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架灵活且模型无关，能有效提升故事可视化的视觉一致性。

Abstract: Story visualization has become a popular task where visual scenes are
generated to depict a narrative across multiple panels. A central challenge in
this setting is maintaining visual consistency, particularly in how characters
and objects persist and evolve throughout the story. Despite recent advances in
diffusion models, current approaches often fail to preserve key character
attributes, leading to incoherent narratives. In this work, we propose a
collaborative multi-agent framework that autonomously identifies, corrects, and
refines inconsistencies across multi-panel story visualizations. The agents
operate in an iterative loop, enabling fine-grained, panel-level updates
without re-generating entire sequences. Our framework is model-agnostic and
flexibly integrates with a variety of diffusion models, including rectified
flow transformers such as Flux and latent diffusion models such as Stable
Diffusion. Quantitative and qualitative experiments show that our method
outperforms prior approaches in terms of multi-panel consistency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在生成逼真且时间一致的视频序列，超越以往专注于游戏风格视觉的工作。

Method: 采用迭代分块预测实现低延迟反馈，结合标记游戏数据和无标记真实视频训练，无需真实动作标注。

Result: 实现了控制信号从虚拟到真实场景的映射，并能控制多种真实实体（如自行车、行人）。

Conclusion: RealPlay展示了从虚拟到真实场景的泛化能力，为交互式视频生成提供了新方向。

Abstract: We introduce RealPlay, a neural network-based real-world game engine that
enables interactive video generation from user control signals. Unlike prior
works focused on game-style visuals, RealPlay aims to produce photorealistic,
temporally consistent video sequences that resemble real-world footage. It
operates in an interactive loop: users observe a generated scene, issue a
control command, and receive a short video chunk in response. To enable such
realistic and responsive generation, we address key challenges including
iterative chunk-wise prediction for low-latency feedback, temporal consistency
across iterations, and accurate control response. RealPlay is trained on a
combination of labeled game data and unlabeled real-world videos, without
requiring real-world action annotations. Notably, we observe two forms of
generalization: (1) control transfer-RealPlay effectively maps control signals
from virtual to real-world scenarios; and (2) entity transfer-although training
labels originate solely from a car racing game, RealPlay generalizes to control
diverse real-world entities, including bicycles and pedestrians, beyond
vehicles. Project page can be found: https://wenqsun.github.io/RealPlay/

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Surfel-Indexed View Memory (VMem)的新型记忆机制，用于构建能够交互式探索环境的视频生成器。该方法通过几何索引过去的视图，高效检索相关信息，显著提升了场景一致性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如2D视图外绘或短上下文窗口的视频生成器）在长期场景一致性和误差累积方面存在局限性，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 引入VMem机制，基于3D表面元素（surfels）几何索引过去的视图，仅检索相关视图生成新视图，减少计算成本。

Result: 在长期场景合成基准测试中表现优异，显著优于现有方法，尤其在场景一致性和相机控制方面。

Conclusion: VMem机制为交互式视频生成提供了一种高效且一致的解决方案，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: We propose a novel memory mechanism to build video generators that can
explore environments interactively. Similar results have previously been
achieved by out-painting 2D views of the scene while incrementally
reconstructing its 3D geometry, which quickly accumulates errors, or by video
generators with a short context window, which struggle to maintain scene
coherence over the long term. To address these limitations, we introduce
Surfel-Indexed View Memory (VMem), a mechanism that remembers past views by
indexing them geometrically based on the 3D surface elements (surfels) they
have observed. VMem enables the efficient retrieval of the most relevant past
views when generating new ones. By focusing only on these relevant views, our
method produces consistent explorations of imagined environments at a fraction
of the computational cost of using all past views as context. We evaluate our
approach on challenging long-term scene synthesis benchmarks and demonstrate
superior performance compared to existing methods in maintaining scene
coherence and camera control.

Motivation: 现有视频重光照技术主要局限于肖像视频或面临时间一致性和计算效率的瓶颈，TC-Light旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用两阶段后优化机制：第一阶段优化外观嵌入以对齐全局光照，第二阶段优化唯一视频张量（UVT）以对齐细粒度和光照。

Result: 实验表明，TC-Light能够实现物理上合理且时间一致的重光照效果，计算成本低。

Conclusion: TC-Light为复杂动态视频的重光照提供了一种高效且一致的解决方案。

Abstract: Editing illumination in long videos with complex dynamics has significant
value in various downstream tasks, including visual content creation and
manipulation, as well as data scaling up for embodied AI through sim2real and
real2real transfer. Nevertheless, existing video relighting techniques are
predominantly limited to portrait videos or fall into the bottleneck of
temporal consistency and computation efficiency. In this paper, we propose
TC-Light, a novel paradigm characterized by the proposed two-stage post
optimization mechanism. Starting from the video preliminarily relighted by an
inflated video relighting model, it optimizes appearance embedding in the first
stage to align global illumination. Then it optimizes the proposed canonical
video representation, i.e., Unique Video Tensor (UVT), to align fine-grained
texture and lighting in the second stage. To comprehensively evaluate
performance, we also establish a long and highly dynamic video benchmark.
Extensive experiments show that our method enables physically plausible
relighting results with superior temporal coherence and low computation cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖复杂架构、显式引导模块或多阶段处理流程的问题，简化动画生成过程。

Method: 将动画生成重新定义为条件未来预测任务，利用预训练的视频扩散变换器进行序列级视觉条件建模。

Result: 实验表明，FramePrompt在多种评估指标上显著优于基线方法，同时简化了训练过程。

Conclusion: 序列级视觉条件化和预训练模型在无需架构修改的情况下，展现了可控动画生成的潜力。

Abstract: Generating controllable character animation from a reference image and motion
guidance remains a challenging task due to the inherent difficulty of injecting
appearance and motion cues into video diffusion models. Prior works often rely
on complex architectures, explicit guider modules, or multi-stage processing
pipelines, which increase structural overhead and hinder deployment. Inspired
by the strong visual context modeling capacity of pre-trained video diffusion
transformers, we propose FramePrompt, a minimalist yet powerful framework that
treats reference images, skeleton-guided motion, and target video clips as a
unified visual sequence. By reformulating animation as a conditional future
prediction task, we bypass the need for guider networks and structural
modifications. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms representative baselines across various evaluation metrics while
also simplifying training. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of
sequence-level visual conditioning and demonstrate the potential of pre-trained
models for controllable animation without architectural changes.

follows a layering-editing-compositing pipeline: (i) segmenting and converting
visual inputs into editable 3D entities (layering), (ii) editing them in
Blender with 3D-grounded control (editing), and (iii) fusing them into a
coherent scene using a generative compositor (compositing). Our generative
compositor extends a pre-trained diffusion model to process both the original

frames with two key training strategies: (i) source masking, enabling flexible
modifications like background replacement; (ii) simulated object jittering,
facilitating disentangled control over objects and camera. BlenderFusion
significantly outperforms prior methods in complex compositional scene editing

Abstract: Recent developments in 3D Gaussian Splatting have made significant advances
in surface reconstruction. However, scaling these methods to large-scale scenes
remains challenging due to high computational demands and the complex dynamic
appearances typical of outdoor environments. These challenges hinder the
application in aerial surveying and autonomous driving. This paper proposes a
novel solution to reconstruct large-scale surfaces with fine details,
supervised by full-sized images. Firstly, we introduce a coarse-to-fine
strategy to reconstruct a coarse model efficiently, followed by adaptive scene
partitioning and sub-scene refining from image segments. Additionally, we
integrate a decoupling appearance model to capture global appearance variations
and a transient mask model to mitigate interference from moving objects.
Finally, we expand the multi-view constraint and introduce a single-view
regularization for texture-less areas. Our experiments were conducted on the
publicly available dataset GauU-Scene V2, which was captured using unmanned
aerial vehicles. To the best of our knowledge, our method outperforms existing
NeRF-based and Gaussian-based methods, achieving high-fidelity visual results
and accurate surface from full-size image optimization. Open-source code will

Motivation: 现有随机纹理过滤（STF）技术在放大时可能产生不良视觉效果，且存在噪声和闪烁问题。

Method: 利用GPU波通信内在特性，在着色器执行中共享解码纹理值，避免重复解压，并提出新的过滤回退方法。

Result: 实现了零误差过滤（放大因子足够大时），并在其他情况下提供了比现有方法更高质量的过滤效果。

Conclusion: 新算法显著提升了纹理放大过滤的质量和效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in texture compression provide major improvements in
compression ratios, but cannot use the GPU's texture units for decompression
and filtering. This has led to the development of stochastic texture filtering
(STF) techniques to avoid the high cost of multiple texel evaluations with such
formats. Unfortunately, those methods can give undesirable visual appearance
changes under magnification and may contain visible noise and flicker despite
the use of spatiotemporal denoisers. Recent work substantially improves the
quality of magnification filtering with STF by sharing decoded texel values
between nearby pixels (Wronski 2025). Using GPU wave communication intrinsics,
this sharing can be performed inside actively executing shaders without memory
traffic overhead. We take this idea further and present novel algorithms that
use wave communication between lanes to avoid repeated texel decompression
prior to filtering. By distributing unique work across lanes, we can achieve
zero-error filtering using <=1 texel evaluations per pixel given a sufficiently
large magnification factor. For the remaining cases, we propose novel filtering
fallback methods that also achieve higher quality than prior approaches.

Method: 将表面切割任务转化为下一个标记预测任务，通过采样点云、编码形状条件，并利用GPT风格变换器顺序预测切割缝段。

Result: 在包含流形和非流形网格的UV展开基准测试中表现优异，并为3D分割工具提供了清晰的边界。

Conclusion: SeamGPT通过模仿专业工作流程，显著提升了表面切割的语义连贯性和性能。

Abstract: Surface cutting is a fundamental task in computer graphics, with applications
in UV parameterization, texture mapping, and mesh decomposition. However,
existing methods often produce technically valid but overly fragmented atlases
that lack semantic coherence. We introduce SeamGPT, an auto-regressive model
that generates cutting seams by mimicking professional workflows. Our key
technical innovation lies in formulating surface cutting as a next token
prediction task: sample point clouds on mesh vertices and edges, encode them as
shape conditions, and employ a GPT-style transformer to sequentially predict
seam segments with quantized 3D coordinates. Our approach achieves exceptional
performance on UV unwrapping benchmarks containing both manifold and
non-manifold meshes, including artist-created, and 3D-scanned models. In
addition, it enhances existing 3D segmentation tools by providing clean
boundaries for part decomposition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加速扩散模型的生成过程，同时保持无损性能。

Method: 结合Dash（预训练扩散模型）和Dot（快速生成残差反馈的模型），通过跳采样和残差反馈策略提升效率。

Result: 在6个图像生成任务中，平均加速1.78X至3.31X，且可推广到其他模型如LCM-SDXL。

Conclusion: Morse在保持性能的同时显著提升了扩散模型的运行效率。

Abstract: In this paper, we present Morse, a simple dual-sampling framework for
accelerating diffusion models losslessly. The key insight of Morse is to
reformulate the iterative generation (from noise to data) process via taking
advantage of fast jump sampling and adaptive residual feedback strategies.
Specifically, Morse involves two models called Dash and Dot that interact with
each other. The Dash model is just the pre-trained diffusion model of any type,
but operates in a jump sampling regime, creating sufficient space for sampling
efficiency improvement. The Dot model is significantly faster than the Dash
model, which is learnt to generate residual feedback conditioned on the
observations at the current jump sampling point on the trajectory of the Dash
model, lifting the noise estimate to easily match the next-step estimate of the
Dash model without jump sampling. By chaining the outputs of the Dash and Dot
models run in a time-interleaved fashion, Morse exhibits the merit of flexibly
attaining desired image generation performance while improving overall runtime
efficiency. With our proposed weight sharing strategy between the Dash and Dot
models, Morse is efficient for training and inference. Our method shows a
lossless speedup of 1.78X to 3.31X on average over a wide range of sampling
step budgets relative to 9 baseline diffusion models on 6 image generation
tasks. Furthermore, we show that our method can be also generalized to improve
the Latent Consistency Model (LCM-SDXL, which is already accelerated with
consistency distillation technique) tailored for few-step text-to-image
synthesis. The code and models are available at

TL;DR: 论文提出WYTWYG框架，利用多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）指导传递函数（TF）优化，解决现有方法探索空间大和泛化性弱的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传递函数设计在直接体渲染中至关重要，但现有方法在探索空间和泛化性方面存在不足。

Method: 提出基于MLLMs的TF优化框架，包含进化探索器和基于MLLMs的渲染质量评估器。

Result: 通过三个案例研究和实验验证了框架的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: WYTWYG框架显著提升了TF优化的效率和泛化能力。

Abstract: Direct volume rendering (DVR) is a fundamental technique for visualizing
volumetric data, with transfer functions (TFs) playing a crucial role in
extracting meaningful structures. However, designing effective TFs remains
unintuitive due to the semantic gap between user intent and TF parameter space.
Researchers have developed numerous TF optimization methods to bridge this gap.
However, existing methods still face two challenges: large exploration space
and weak generalizability. To address these issues, we propose What You Think
is What You Get (WYTWYG) framework, which leveraging Multi-model Large Language
Models (MLLMs) to guide the TF optimization based on user intent. Specifically,
we first introduce a novel TF optimization approach comprising two core
components: (1) an evolution-based explorer for effective exploration of the TF
space, and (2) a volume rendering quality evaluator based on MLLMs to provide
generalizable visual guidance. We further propose a TF interactive design
system based on this approach. We demonstrate the general applicability of our
framework through three case studies, and validate the effectiveness of each
component through extensive experiments. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: BulletGen利用生成模型修正高斯动态场景表示中的错误和缺失信息，通过扩散模型生成帧优化4D高斯模型，实现新颖视角合成和2D/3D跟踪任务的最佳效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单目视频动态场景重建中的未观测区域重建和深度估计模糊问题。

Method: 结合生成模型（扩散模型）与高斯动态场景表示，生成帧用于监督4D高斯模型优化。

Result: 在新颖视角合成和2D/3D跟踪任务中达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: BulletGen成功融合生成内容与静态/动态场景组件，解决了单目视频动态重建的挑战。

Abstract: Transforming casually captured, monocular videos into fully immersive dynamic
experiences is a highly ill-posed task, and comes with significant challenges,
e.g., reconstructing unseen regions, and dealing with the ambiguity in
monocular depth estimation. In this work we introduce BulletGen, an approach
that takes advantage of generative models to correct errors and complete
missing information in a Gaussian-based dynamic scene representation. This is
done by aligning the output of a diffusion-based video generation model with
the 4D reconstruction at a single frozen "bullet-time" step. The generated
frames are then used to supervise the optimization of the 4D Gaussian model.
Our method seamlessly blends generative content with both static and dynamic
scene components, achieving state-of-the-art results on both novel-view
synthesis, and 2D/3D tracking tasks.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: DuetGen是一个新颖的框架，用于从音乐生成交互式双人舞蹈。通过两阶段方法（编码舞蹈动作为离散标记并生成这些标记）和分层掩码建模，实现了同步和交互性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双人舞蹈的交互复杂性要求舞者彼此同步并与音乐同步，现有方法难以有效捕捉这些细节。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1）使用VQ-VAE分层编码舞蹈动作为离散标记；2）用掩码变换器从音乐生成高、低层标记。

Result: 在基准数据集上，DuetGen在动作真实性、音乐-舞蹈对齐和舞伴协调方面表现优异。

Conclusion: DuetGen通过分层建模和交互表示，成功生成了同步且交互性强的双人舞蹈。

Abstract: We present DuetGen, a novel framework for generating interactive two-person
dances from music. The key challenge of this task lies in the inherent
complexities of two-person dance interactions, where the partners need to
synchronize both with each other and with the music. Inspired by the recent
advances in motion synthesis, we propose a two-stage solution: encoding
two-person motions into discrete tokens and then generating these tokens from
music. To effectively capture intricate interactions, we represent both
dancers' motions as a unified whole to learn the necessary motion tokens, and
adopt a coarse-to-fine learning strategy in both the stages. Our first stage
utilizes a VQ-VAE that hierarchically separates high-level semantic features at
a coarse temporal resolution from low-level details at a finer resolution,
producing two discrete token sequences at different abstraction levels.
Subsequently, in the second stage, two generative masked transformers learn to
map music signals to these dance tokens: the first producing high-level
semantic tokens, and the second, conditioned on music and these semantic
tokens, producing the low-level tokens. We train both transformers to learn to
predict randomly masked tokens within the sequence, enabling them to
iteratively generate motion tokens by filling an empty token sequence during
inference. Through the hierarchical masked modeling and dedicated interaction
representation, DuetGen achieves the generation of synchronized and interactive
two-person dances across various genres. Extensive experiments and user studies
on a benchmark duet dance dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of
DuetGen in motion realism, music-dance alignment, and partner coordination.

Conclusion: 该方法为布料模拟提供了一种新的空间离散化方案，具有广阔的应用前景。

Abstract: We present a B-spline finite element method (FEM) for cloth simulation.
Building on quadratic B-spline basis functions, our method provides a globally
$C^1$-continuous displacement field, enabling consistent and accurate
discretization of both membrane and bending energies. This smooth
representation effectively mitigates locking artifacts and mesh dependency
issues commonly observed with linear FEM. To further improve efficiency, we
develop a reduced integration scheme that separately optimizes quadrature rules
for membrane and bending energies, further reducing computational overhead
while maintaining accuracy. We validate our approach through extensive
experiments, demonstrating improved accuracy, visual quality, and efficiency
compared to linear FEM and recent higher-order methods. Our method enables
realistic simulation of complex wrinkling dynamics across varying material
parameters, offering a promising new spatial discretization for cloth
simulation.

Motivation: 探索组合合同模型中计算最优合同的可处理性边界，挑战了以往认为子模性是关键的观点。

Method: 通过分析超模函数（Ultra）的性质，提出新方法处理非子模情况，并扩展到对称加性成本。

Result: 证明超模函数是可处理性的关键，且可处理性扩展到更广泛的成本结构。

Conclusion: 超模函数在经济学中首次应用，揭示了其在最优合同问题中的重要性。

Abstract: We study the optimal contract problem in the framework of combinatorial
contracts, introduced by Duetting et al. [FOCS'21], where a principal delegates
the execution of a project to an agent, and the agent can choose any subset
from a given set of costly actions. At the core of the model is a reward
function - a monotone set function that maps each set of actions taken by the
agent into an expected reward to the principal. To incentivize the agent, the
principal offers a contract specifying the fraction of the reward to be paid,
and the agent responds with their optimal action set. The goal is to compute
the contract that maximizes the principal's expected utility.
  Previous work showed that when the reward function is gross substitutes (GS),
the optimal contract can be computed in polynomial time, but the problem is
NP-hard for the broader class of Submodular functions. This raised the
question: is GS the true boundary of tractability for the optimal contract
problem? We prove that tractability extends to the strictly broader class of
Ultra functions. Interestingly, GS constitutes precisely the intersection of
Ultra and Submodular functions, and our result reveals that it is Ultra - not
Submodular - that drives tractability, overturning the prevailing belief that
the submodularity component of GS is essential. We further extend tractability
beyond additive costs, handling costs that are additive plus symmetric. Our
results require new techniques, as prior approaches relied on the submodularity
of GS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of Ultra
functions in a prominent economic setting.

Motivation: 探索更精细的最优策略标准，以控制计算复杂度并优化策略求解。

Method: 利用代数数的分离界限，包括Lagrange界限和基于Mahler测度及多重性定理的高级技术。

Result: 首次给出了d敏感阈值的界限，并改进了Blackwell阈值的界限。

Conclusion: 通过代数数理论的应用，为游戏理论中的策略优化提供了新的界限和工具。

Abstract: We investigate refinements of the mean-payoff criterion in two-player
zero-sum perfect-information stochastic games. A strategy is Blackwell optimal
if it is optimal in the discounted game for all discount factors sufficiently
close to $1$. The notion of $d$-sensitive optimality interpolates between
mean-payoff optimality (corresponding to the case $d=-1$) and Blackwell
optimality ($d=+\infty$). The Blackwell threshold $\alpha_{\sf Bw} \in [0,1[$
is the discount factor above which all optimal strategies in the discounted
game are guaranteed to be Blackwell optimal. The $d$-sensitive threshold
$\alpha_{\sf d} \in [0,1[$ is defined analogously. Bounding $\alpha_{\sf Bw}$
and $\alpha_{\sf d}$ are fundamental problems in algorithmic game theory, since
these thresholds control the complexity for computing Blackwell and
$d$-sensitive optimal strategies, by reduction to discounted games which can be
solved in $O\left((1-\alpha)^{-1}\right)$ iterations. We provide the first
bounds on the $d$-sensitive threshold $\alpha_{\sf d}$ beyond the case $d=-1$,
and we establish improved bounds for the Blackwell threshold $\alpha_{\sf Bw}$.
This is achieved by leveraging separation bounds on algebraic numbers, relying
on Lagrange bounds and more advanced techniques based on Mahler measures and
multiplicity theorems.

Result: 学习代理可能收敛到均衡，也可能出现周期或混沌行为；研究了稳定性和收敛条件。

Conclusion: 论文为分析自主学习和代理驱动的市场稳定性与收敛性提供了数学基础。

Abstract: Autonomous and learning agents increasingly participate in markets - setting
prices, placing bids, ordering inventory. Such agents are not just aiming to
optimize in an uncertain environment; they are making decisions in a
game-theoretical environment where the decision of one agent influences the
profit of other agents. While game theory usually predicts outcomes of
strategic interaction as an equilibrium, it does not capture how repeated
interaction of learning agents arrives at a certain outcome. This article
surveys developments in modeling agent behavior as dynamical systems, with a
focus on projected gradient and no-regret learning algorithms. In general,
learning in games can lead to all types of dynamics, including convergence to
equilibrium, but also cycles and chaotic behavior. It is important to
understand when we can expect efficient equilibrium in automated markets and
when this is not the case. Thus, we analyze when and how learning agents
converge to an equilibrium of a market game, drawing on tools from variational
inequalities and Lyapunov stability theory. Special attention is given to the
stability of projected dynamics and the convergence to equilibrium sets as
limiting outcomes. Overall, the paper provides mathematical foundations for
analyzing stability and convergence in agentic markets driven by autonomous,
learning agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注选民的比例代表性，而本文转向候选人的公平代表性问题，确保相似选民支持的候选人获得可比代表。

Method: 开发了随机化投票规则（如Softmax-GJCR），满足算法稳定性，并通过调整时间复杂度和代表性要求来优化稳定性。

Result: 提出的规则在多项式时间内满足EJR+，并提供了稳定性保证，同时适用于动态投票和隐私敏感场景。

Conclusion: 稳定的投票规则在动态和隐私敏感环境中具有实用价值，为候选人公平代表提供了新视角。

Abstract: We study approval-based committee voting from a novel perspective. While
extant work largely centers around proportional representation of the voters,
we shift our focus to the candidates while preserving proportionality.
Intuitively, candidates supported by similar voter groups should receive
comparable representation. Since deterministic voting rules cannot achieve this
ideal, we develop randomized voting rules that satisfy ex-ante neutrality,
monotonicity, and continuity, while maintaining strong ex-post proportionality
guarantees.
  Continuity of the candidate selection probabilities proves to be the most
demanding of our ex-ante desiderata. We provide it via voting rules that are
algorithmically stable, a stronger notion of robustness which captures the
continuity of the committee distribution under small changes. First, we
introduce Softmax-GJCR, a randomized variant of the Greedy Justified Candidate
Rule (GJCR) [Brill and Peters, 2023], which carefully leverages slack in GJCR
to satisfy our ex-ante properties. This polynomial-time algorithm satisfies
EJR+ ex post, assures ex-ante monotonicity and neutrality, and provides
$O(k^3/n)$-stability (ignoring $\log$ factors). Building on our techniques for
Softmax-GJCR, we further show that stronger stability guarantees can be
attained by (i) allowing exponential running time, (ii) relaxing EJR+ to an
approximate $\alpha$-EJR+, and (iii) relaxing EJR+ to JR.
  We finally demonstrate the utility of stable voting rules in other settings.
In online dynamic committee voting, we show that stable voting rules imply
dynamic voting rules with low expected recourse, and illustrate this reduction
for Softmax-GJCR. Our voting rules also satisfy a stronger form of stability
that coincides with differential privacy, suggesting their applicability in
privacy-sensitive domains.

Conclusion: 不同货币转移方法在消除嫉妒时有各自的优化目标和限制，需根据具体场景选择合适方法。

Abstract: When allocating indivisible items, there are various ways to use monetary
transfers for eliminating envy. Particularly, one can apply a balanced vector
of transfer payments, or charge each agent a positive amount, or -- contrarily
-- give each agent a positive amount as a ``subsidy''. In each model, one can
aim to minimize the amount of payments used; this aim translates into different
optimization objectives in each setting. This note compares the various models,
and the relations between upper and lower bounds for these objectives.

Result: 参与者对早期关注RAI问题表现出强烈兴趣，并能有效识别低风险高收益的AI概念。

Conclusion: 设计主导的方法有望在AI创新早期嵌入伦理和服务设计思维，为HCI和RAI社区提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: AI projects often fail due to financial, technical, ethical, or user
acceptance challenges -- failures frequently rooted in early-stage decisions.
While HCI and Responsible AI (RAI) research emphasize this, practical
approaches for identifying promising concepts early remain limited. Drawing on
Research through Design, this paper investigates how early-stage AI concept
sorting in commercial settings can reflect RAI principles. Through three design
experiments -- including a probe study with industry practitioners -- we
explored methods for evaluating risks and benefits using multidisciplinary
collaboration. Participants demonstrated strong receptivity to addressing RAI
concerns early in the process and effectively identified low-risk, high-benefit
AI concepts. Our findings highlight the potential of a design-led approach to
embed ethical and service design thinking at the front end of AI innovation. By
examining how practitioners reason about AI concepts, our study invites HCI and
RAI communities to see early-stage innovation as a critical space for engaging
ethical and commercial considerations together.

Abstract: We present Full-body WPT, wireless power networking around the human body
using a meandered textile coil. Unlike traditional inductive systems that emit
strong fields into the deep tissue inside the body, the meander coil enables
localized generation of strong magnetic field constrained to the skin surface,
even when scaled to the size of the human body. Such localized inductive system
enhances both safety and efficiency of wireless power around the body.
Furthermore, the use of low-loss conductive yarn achieve energy-efficient and
lightweight design. We analyze the performance of our design through
simulations and experimental prototypes, demonstrating high power transfer
efficiency and adaptability to user movement and posture. Our system provides a
safe and efficient distributed power network using meandered textile coils
integrated into wearable materials, highlighting the potential of body-centric
wireless power networking as a foundational layer for ubiquitous health

Motivation: 反馈信号在日常交流中至关重要，但AAC用户因技术限制难以实现，影响了交流流畅性。

Method: 通过工作坊（4名AAC用户）和深度访谈（4名语言病理学家）研究反馈信号的独特性和变化。

Result: 发现AAC用户与非AAC用户交流时反馈信号方式不同，并形成独特的沟通文化。

Conclusion: 反馈信号是一种微观文化实践，需重新思考AAC技术中的体现与中介，设计应尊重不同沟通文化并支持多模态反馈。

Abstract: Backchanneling (e.g., "uh-huh", "hmm", a simple nod) encompasses a big part
of everyday communication; it is how we negotiate the turn to speak, it signals
our engagement, and shapes the flow of our conversations. For people with
speech and motor impairments, backchanneling is limited to a reduced set of
modalities, and their Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC)
technology requires visual attention, making it harder to observe non-verbal
cues of conversation partners. We explore how users of AAC technology approach
backchanneling and create their own unique channels and communication culture.
We conducted a workshop with 4 AAC users to understand the unique
characteristics of backchanneling in AAC. We explored how backchanneling
changes when pairs of AAC users communicate vs when an AAC user communicates
with a non-AAC user. We contextualize these findings through four in-depth
interviews with speech-language pathologists (SLPs). We conclude with a
discussion about backchanneling as a micro-cultural practice, rethinking
embodiment and mediation in AAC technology, and providing design
recommendations for timely multi-modal backchanneling while respecting
different communication cultures.

Motivation: 理解C-XAI中概念的泛化是否被人类认可，以及是否能区分泛化与不精确性，以评估AI模型对复杂任务的理解能力。

Method: 通过实验铁路安全场景，参与者评估模拟AI的危险判断，AI提供不同匹配度的概念解释（相关或不相关特征）。

Result: 参与者对不相关特征泛化的评价低于精确匹配，且与系统性错误概念相当；对相关特征的精确性高度敏感。

Conclusion: 人类可能无法自发识别泛化，因此难以通过C-XAI概念判断AI是否真正理解复杂情境。

Abstract: Concept-based explainable artificial intelligence (C-XAI) can help reveal the
inner representations of AI models. Understanding these representations is
particularly important in complex tasks like safety evaluation. Such tasks rely
on high-level semantic information (e.g., about actions) to make decisions
about abstract categories (e.g., whether a situation is dangerous). In this
context, it may desirable for C-XAI concepts to show some variability,
suggesting that the AI is capable of generalising beyond the concrete details
of a situation. However, it is unclear whether people recognise and appreciate
such generalisations and can distinguish them from other, less desirable forms
of imprecision. This was investigated in an experimental railway safety
scenario. Participants evaluated the performance of a simulated AI that
evaluated whether traffic scenes involving people were dangerous. To explain
these decisions, the AI provided concepts in the form of similar image
snippets. These concepts differed in their match with the classified image,
either regarding a highly relevant feature (i.e., relation to tracks) or a less
relevant feature (i.e., actions). Contrary to the hypotheses, concepts that
generalised over less relevant features led to ratings that were lower than for
precisely matching concepts and comparable to concepts that systematically
misrepresented these features. Conversely, participants were highly sensitive
to imprecisions in relevant features. These findings cast doubts on whether
people spontaneously recognise generalisations. Accordingly, they might not be
able to infer from C-XAI concepts whether AI models have gained a deeper
understanding of complex situations.

Abstract: The notion of machine companions has long been embedded in
social-technological imaginaries. Recent advances in AI have moved those media
musings into believable sociality manifested in interfaces, robotic bodies, and
devices. Those machines are often referred to colloquially as "companions" yet
there is little careful engagement of machine companionship (MC) as a formal
concept or measured variable. This PRISMA-guided scoping review systematically
samples, surveys, and synthesizes current scholarly works on MC (N = 71;
2017-2025), to that end. Works varied widely in considerations of MC according
to guiding theories, dimensions of a-priori specified properties (subjectively
positive, sustained over time, co-active, autotelic), and in measured concepts
(with more than 50 distinct measured variables). WE ultimately offer a
literature-guided definition of MC as an autotelic, coordinated connection
between human and machine that unfolds over time and is subjectively positive.

Conclusion: AI Harmonizer是AI辅助音乐表演的重要进展，未来将探索实时实现并开源代码。

Abstract: Vocals harmonizers are powerful tools to help solo vocalists enrich their
melodies with harmonically supportive voices. These tools exist in various
forms, from commercially available pedals and software to custom-built systems,
each employing different methods to generate harmonies. Traditional harmonizers
often require users to manually specify a key or tonal center, while others
allow pitch selection via an external keyboard-both approaches demanding some
degree of musical expertise. The AI Harmonizer introduces a novel approach by
autonomously generating musically coherent four-part harmonies without
requiring prior harmonic input from the user. By integrating state-of-the-art
generative AI techniques for pitch detection and voice modeling with
custom-trained symbolic music models, our system arranges any vocal melody into
rich choral textures. In this paper, we present our methods, explore potential
applications in performance and composition, and discuss future directions for
real-time implementations. While our system currently operates offline, we
believe it represents a significant step toward AI-assisted vocal performance
and expressive musical augmentation. We release our implementation on GitHub.

Conclusion: 讨论了结果并提出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: In this work, we explore the musical interface potential of the MindCube, an
interactive device designed to study emotions. Embedding diverse sensors and
input devices, this interface resembles a fidget cube toy commonly used to help
users relieve their stress and anxiety. As such, it is a particularly
well-suited controller for musical systems that aim to help with emotion
regulation. In this regard, we present two different mappings for the MindCube,
with and without AI. With our generative AI mapping, we propose a way to infuse
meaning within a latent space and techniques to navigate through it with an
external controller. We discuss our results and propose directions for future
work.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个名为Co-Persona的框架，通过结合大型语言模型（LLMs）和专家验证，将大规模社交媒体分析与用户理解联系起来。通过一个中国制造商B.Co的案例研究，分析了小红书上的3800万条帖子，揭示了五种基于夜间行为的用户画像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过整合社交媒体数据和LLMs，帮助制造商更好地理解用户需求和行为，从而优化产品设计和营销策略。

Method: 采用多阶段NLP处理技术，结合LLMs和专家验证，分析社交媒体数据以生成用户画像。

Result: 研究识别出五种用户画像（如健康爱好者、夜猫子等），每种画像具有独特的睡前活动和产品偏好。

Conclusion: Co-Persona框架不仅提升了制造商对社交数据的解读能力，还为用户驱动的创新提供了实用策略，推动了理论画像开发与实际应用的结合。

Abstract: This study introduces \textsc{Co-Persona}, a framework bridging large-scale
social media analysis and user understanding via integration of Large Language
Models (LLMs) and expert validation. Through a case study of B.Co, a Chinese
manufacturer, we applied \textsc{Co-Persona} to bedside lamp development by
analyzing 38 million posts from Xiao Hongshu. Our multi-stage NLP processing
revealed five user personas based on nighttime behaviors: Health Aficionados,
Night Owls, Interior Decorators, Child-care Workers, and Workaholics. These
personas exhibit distinct pre-sleep activities and product preferences. The
method enhances manufacturers' ability to interpret social data while
preserving user-centric insights, offering actionable strategies for targeted
marketing and product design. This work advances both theoretical persona
development and practical consumer-driven innovation.

*Feiqi Gu,Zhixiong Wang,Zhenyu Wang,Dengbo He*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究探讨了通过车辆间通信（V2V）提供超视距（BVR）信息对跟车（CF）安全的影响，设计了四种人机界面（HMI）并进行了模拟驾驶实验。结果显示BVR信息能提升安全，尤其是新手驾驶员，其中Brake-HMI效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管有防撞警告等措施，追尾事故仍频发。驾驶员在跟车时可能依赖更多信息，因此研究BVR信息是否能通过V2V通信提升安全。

Method: 设计了四种BVR信息HMI（Brake-HMI、Dis-HMI、THW-HMI、Video-HMI），通过40名参与者的模拟驾驶实验评估其效果。

Result: BVR信息普遍提升安全，Brake-HMI在链式刹车事件中表现最佳，而Video-HMI增加了注意力负担但无显著益处。

Conclusion: BVR信息通过V2V通信能有效提升跟车安全，尤其是新手驾驶员，Brake-HMI是最优选择。

Abstract: Rear-end collisions constituted a large portion of crashes on the road,
despite efforts to mitigate rear-end collisions, such as forward collision
warnings. The chance of rear-end collisions is closely related to drivers'
car-following (CF) behaviors in the traffic flow. Given that drivers may rely
on more than the information of the direct lead vehicle (DLV) when making CF
decisions, expanding drivers' perceptual range by providing beyond-visual-range
(BVR) information based on vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication may enhance
CF safety. Thus, four different human-machine interfaces (HMIs) providing
various types of BVR information in CF events were designed, including
Brake-HMI showing only brake action of indirect lead vehicles (ILV), Dis-HMI
and THW-HMI showing the relative distance and time headway between the ILV and
DLV, respectively, and Video-HMI showing the live-stream video of ILV from the
perspective of DLV. A driving simulator experiment with 40 participants was
conducted to evaluate the impact of BVR-based HMI on driving safety in CF
events. We found that, in general, BVR information could improve CF safety
without overloading drivers and compromising their visual attention allocation
strategies, particularly among novice drivers, by enabling quicker brake
responses and increasing time headway and time-to-collision in brake events.
The Brake-HMI yielded the safest performance in chain brake events, whereas
Video-HMI increased attentional demands without observable benefits. This
research provides insights into enabling drivers' BVR perception based on V2V
communication to enhance driving safety in CF scenarios.

Motivation: 现有室内定位方法实用性不足，难以广泛部署，PeepLoc旨在提供一种可扩展且易于部署的解决方案。

Method: PeepLoc结合非合作飞行时间测量和行人航位推算，利用现有Wi-Fi接入点和移动设备实现定位。

Result: 在4栋校园建筑中测试，PeepLoc的平均和中位定位误差分别为3.41米和3.06米，优于现有系统。

Conclusion: PeepLoc是一种实用且高效的室内定位方案，性能接近室外GPS。

Abstract: Indoor localization opens the path to potentially transformative
applications. Although many indoor localization methods have been proposed over
the years, they remain too impractical for widespread deployment in the real
world. In this paper, we introduce PeepLoc, a deployable and scalable
Wi-Fi-based solution for indoor localization that relies only on pre-existing
devices and infrastructure. Specifically, PeepLoc works on any mobile device
with an unmodified Wi-Fi transceiver and in any indoor environment with a
sufficient number of Wi-Fi access points (APs) and pedestrian traffic. At the
core of PeepLoc is (a) a mechanism which allows any Wi-Fi device to obtain
non-cooperative time-of-flight (ToF) to any Wi-Fi AP and (b) a novel
bootstrapping mechanism that relies on pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) and
crowdsourcing to opportunistically initialize pre-existing APs as anchor points
within an environment. We implement PeepLoc using commodity hardware and
evaluate it extensively across 4 campus buildings. We show PeepLoc leads to a
mean and median positional error of 3.41 m and 3.06 m respectively, which is
superior to existing deployed indoor localization systems and is competitive
with commodity GPS in outdoor environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖手工启发式或领域特定规则，缺乏通用性和可解释性。CODS旨在提供一种通用且可解释的设计框架。

Method: CODS利用大型语言模型通过结构化提示工程自动生成软硬约束，指导优化过程生成符合用户意图的设计方案。

Result: 在可视化设计和针织品生成两个领域验证，CODS在设计质量、意图对齐和用户偏好上优于现有基于LLM的方法。

Conclusion: CODS为可扩展、可控的AI驱动设计自动化提供了统一基础。

Abstract: We introduce CODS (Computational Optimization in Design Space), a theoretical
model that frames computational design as a constrained optimization problem
over a structured, multi-dimensional design space. Unlike existing methods that
rely on handcrafted heuristics or domain-specific rules, CODS provides a
generalizable and interpretable framework that supports diverse design tasks.
Given a user requirement and a well-defined design space, CODS automatically
derives soft and hard constraints using large language models through a
structured prompt engineering pipeline. These constraints guide the
optimization process to generate design solutions that are coherent,
expressive, and aligned with user intent. We validate our approach across two
domains-visualization design and knitwear generation-demonstrating superior
performance in design quality, intent alignment, and user preference compared
to existing LLM-based methods. CODS offers a unified foundation for scalable,
controllable, and AI-powered design automation.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究通过参与式众包方法收集用户对自动驾驶车辆外部人机界面（eHMI）的设计想法，发现用户偏好使用灯光、符号和文本来传达车辆意图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆在共享环境中需要有效沟通以确保安全，但现有eHMI研究缺乏用户早期参与。

Method: 采用参与式众包方法，分两阶段研究（29人和50人），用户根据风险场景设计eHMI草图。

Result: 用户偏好多模态（灯光、符号、文本）、方向性和适应性设计，强调直观性和熟悉元素。

Conclusion: 用户参与早期设计能优化eHMI，提升自动驾驶车辆的沟通效果。

Abstract: As autonomous vehicles become more integrated into shared human environments,
effective communication with road users is essential for ensuring safety. While
previous research has focused on developing external Human-Machine Interfaces
(eHMIs) to facilitate these interactions, we argue that involving users in the
early creative stages can help address key challenges in the development of
this technology. To explore this, our study adopts a participatory,
crowd-sourced approach to gather user-generated ideas for eHMI designs.
Participants were first introduced to fundamental eHMI concepts, equipping them
to sketch their own design ideas in response to scenarios with varying levels
of perceived risk. An initial pre-study with 29 participants showed that while
they actively engaged in the process, there was a need to refine task
objectives and encourage deeper reflection. To address these challenges, a
follow-up study with 50 participants was conducted. The results revealed a
strong preference for autonomous vehicles to communicate their awareness and
intentions using lights (LEDs and projections), symbols, and text.
Participants' sketches prioritized multi-modal communication, directionality,
and adaptability to enhance clarity, consistently integrating familiar vehicle
elements to improve intuitiveness.

Motivation: 探讨视觉风格如何影响玩家对卡牌实际强度的感知，以提升游戏设计。

Method: 通过单盲调查，使用AI生成的两种风格卡牌（可爱与英雄），分析玩家对其强度的判断。

Result: 部分玩家受视觉风格影响，整体呈正态分布，但个体差异显著。

Conclusion: 视觉风格对玩家感知有影响，但个体差异需在设计时考虑。

Abstract: The visual style of game elements considerably contributes to the overall
experience. Aesthetics influence player appeal, while the abilities of game
pieces define their in-game functionality. In this paper, we investigate how
the visual style of collectible cards influences the players' perception of the
card's actual strength in the game. Using the popular trading card game Magic:
The Gathering, we conduct a single-blind survey study that examines how players
perceive the strength of AI-generated cards that are shown in two contrasting
visual styles: cute and harmless, or heroic and mighty. Our analysis reveals
that some participants are influenced by a card's visual appearance when
judging its in-game strength. Overall, differences in style perception are
normally distributed around a neutral center, but individual participants vary
in both directions: some generally perceive the cute style to be stronger,
whereas others believe that the heroic style is better.

Abstract: The integration of Generative AI (GenAI) into creative communities, like
fanfiction, is reshaping how stories are created, shared, and valued. This
study investigates the perceptions of 157 active fanfiction members, both
readers and writers, regarding AI-generated content in fanfiction. Our research
explores the impact of GenAI on community dynamics, examining how AI affects
the participatory and collaborative nature of these spaces. The findings reveal
responses ranging from cautious acceptance of AI's potential for creative
enhancement to concerns about authenticity, ethical issues, and the erosion of
human-centered values. Participants emphasized the importance of transparency
and expressed worries about losing social connections. Our study highlights the
need for thoughtful AI integration in creative platforms using design
interventions that enable ethical practices, promote transparency, increase
engagement and connection, and preserve the community's core values.

Method: 采用参与式方法，与专业艺术教育者合作设计“与机器人一起绘画”课程，观察互动并访谈参与者。

Result: 老年人喜欢作为策展人评价机器人建议，但机器人反馈有时缺乏对上下文和艺术目标的理解。

Conclusion: LLM增强的机器人有潜力支持创造力，未来需改进其反馈的敏感性和理解力。

Abstract: The goal of this study is to identify factors that support and enhance older
adults' creative experiences in human-robot co-creativity. Because the research
into the use of robots for creativity support with older adults remains
underexplored, we carried out an exploratory case study. We took a
participatory approach and collaborated with professional art educators to
design a course Drawing with Robots for adults aged 65 and over. The course
featured human-human and human-robot drawing activities with various types of
robots. We observed collaborative drawing interactions, interviewed
participants on their experiences, and analyzed collected data. Findings show
that participants preferred acting as curators, evaluating creative suggestions
from the robot in a teacher or coach role. When we enhanced a robot with a
multimodal Large Language Model (LLM), participants appreciated its spoken
dialogue capabilities. They reported however, that the robot's feedback
sometimes lacked an understanding of the context, and sensitivity to their
artistic goals and preferences. Our findings highlight the potential of
LLM-enhanced robots to support creativity and offer future directions for
advancing human-robot co-creativity with older adults.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有计算机化程序（CBPs）与人机界面（HSIs）缺乏语义集成，限制了智能自动化的能力，增加了复杂操作条件下的人为错误风险。

Method: AutoGraph结合了HTRPM跟踪模块、界面元素知识图谱（IE-KG）、文本程序到可执行路径的自动映射以及执行引擎。

Result: 验证显示任务完成时间显著减少，支持实时人类可靠性评估，并展示了在动态HRA框架中的扩展性。

Conclusion: AutoGraph通过增强程序安全和认知性能，为复杂社会技术系统提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Digitalization in nuclear power plant (NPP) control rooms is reshaping how
operators interact with procedures and interface elements. However, existing
computer-based procedures (CBPs) often lack semantic integration with
human-system interfaces (HSIs), limiting their capacity to support intelligent
automation and increasing the risk of human error, particularly under dynamic
or complex operating conditions. In this study, we present AutoGraph, a
knowledge-graph-based framework designed to formalize and automate procedure
execution in digitalized NPP environments.AutoGraph integrates (1) a proposed
HTRPM tracking module to capture operator interactions and interface element
locations; (2) an Interface Element Knowledge Graph (IE-KG) encoding spatial,
semantic, and structural properties of HSIs; (3) automatic mapping from textual
procedures to executable interface paths; and (4) an execution engine that maps
textual procedures to executable interface paths. This enables the
identification of cognitively demanding multi-action steps and supports fully
automated execution with minimal operator input. We validate the framework
through representative control room scenarios, demonstrating significant
reductions in task completion time and the potential to support real-time human
reliability assessment. Further integration into dynamic HRA frameworks (e.g.,
COGMIF) and real-time decision support systems (e.g., DRIF) illustrates
AutoGraph extensibility in enhancing procedural safety and cognitive
performance in complex socio-technical systems.

Conclusion: 系统主义视角为生命科学的概念建模提供了新的工具和方法，有助于解决该领域的复杂问题。

Abstract: All aspects of our society, including the life sciences, need a mechanism for
people working within them to represent the concepts they employ to carry out
their research. For the information systems being designed and developed to
support researchers and scientists in conducting their work, conceptual models
of the relevant domains are usually designed as both blueprints for a system
being developed and as a means of communication between the designer and
developer. Most conceptual modelling concepts are generic in the sense that
they are applied with the same understanding across many applications. Problems
in the life sciences, however, are especially complex and important, because
they deal with humans, their well-being, and their interactions with the
environment as well as other organisms. This work proposes a systemist
perspective for creating a conceptual model of a life scientist's problem. We
introduce the notion of a system and then show how it can be applied to the
development of an information system for handling genomic-related information.
We extend our discussion to show how the proposed systemist perspective can
support the modelling of precision medicine. This research recognizes
challenges in life sciences research of how to model problems to better
represent the connections between physical and digital worlds. We propose a new
notation that explicitly incorporates systemist thinking, as well as the
components of systems based on recent ontological foundations. The new notation
captures important semantics in the domain of life sciences. It may be used to
facilitate understanding, communication and problem-solving more broadly. We
also provide a precise, sound, ontologically supported characterization of the
term system, as a basic construct for conceptual modelling in life sciences.

Abstract: The role of information systems (IS) as representations of real-world systems
is changing in an increasingly digitalized world, suggesting that conceptual
modeling is losing its relevance to the IS field. We argue the opposite:
Conceptual modeling research is more relevant to the IS field than ever, but it
requires an update with current theory. We develop a new theoretical framework
of conceptual modeling that delivers a fundamental shift in the assumptions
that govern research in this area. This move can make traditional knowledge
about conceptual modeling consistent with the emerging requirements of a
digital world. Our framework draws attention to the role of conceptual modeling
scripts as mediators between physical and digital realities. We identify new
research questions about grammars, methods, scripts, agents, and contexts that
are situated in intertwined physical and digital realities. We discuss several
implications for conceptual modeling scholarship that relate to the necessity
of developing new methods and grammars for conceptual modeling, broadening the
methodological array of conceptual modeling scholarship, and considering new
dependent variables.

Result: 分类准确率达到96%，响应延迟为150毫秒，适用于多用户和低功耗嵌入式部署。

Conclusion: BRAVE为非侵入式假肢控制提供了稳健、实时的解决方案。

Abstract: Non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have the potential to enable
intuitive control of prosthetic limbs for individuals with upper limb
amputations. However, existing EEG-based control systems face challenges
related to signal noise, classification accuracy, and real-time adaptability.
In this work, we present BRAVE, a hybrid EEG and voice-controlled prosthetic
system that integrates ensemble learning-based EEG classification with a
human-in-the-loop (HITL) correction framework for enhanced responsiveness.
Unlike traditional electromyography (EMG)-based prosthetic control, BRAVE aims
to interpret EEG-driven motor intent, enabling movement control without
reliance on residual muscle activity. To improve classification robustness,
BRAVE combines LSTM, CNN, and Random Forest models in an ensemble framework,
achieving a classification accuracy of 96% across test subjects. EEG signals
are preprocessed using a bandpass filter (0.5-45 Hz), Independent Component
Analysis (ICA) for artifact removal, and Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) feature
extraction to minimize contamination from electromyographic (EMG) and
electrooculographic (EOG) signals. Additionally, BRAVE incorporates automatic
speech recognition (ASR) to facilitate intuitive mode switching between
different degrees of freedom (DOF) in the prosthetic arm. The system operates
in real time, with a response latency of 150 ms, leveraging Lab Streaming Layer
(LSL) networking for synchronized data acquisition. The system is evaluated on
an in-house fabricated prosthetic arm and on multiple participants highlighting
the generalizability across users. The system is optimized for low-power
embedded deployment, ensuring practical real-world application beyond
high-performance computing environments. Our results indicate that BRAVE offers
a promising step towards robust, real-time, non-invasive prosthetic control.

Conclusion: 提出基于对话的界面设计，探索个性化解释需求，强调医疗场景中复杂解释的必要性。

Abstract: This paper evaluates the user interface of an in vitro fertility (IVF)
outcome prediction tool, focussing on its understandability for patients or
potential patients. We analyse four years of anonymous patient feedback,
followed by a user survey and interviews to quantify trust and
understandability. Results highlight a lay user's need for prediction model
\emph{explainability} beyond the model feature space. We identify user concerns
about data shifts and model exclusions that impact trust. The results call
attention to the shortcomings of current practices in explainable AI research
and design and the need for explainability beyond model feature space and
epistemic assumptions, particularly in high-stakes healthcare contexts where
users gather extensive information and develop complex mental models. To
address these challenges, we propose a dialogue-based interface and explore
user expectations for personalised explanations.

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integrated into
high-stakes domains like healthcare, effective collaboration between healthcare
experts and AI systems is critical. Data-centric steering, which involves
fine-tuning prediction models by improving training data quality, plays a key
role in this process. However, little research has explored how varying levels
of user control affect healthcare experts during data-centric steering. We
address this gap by examining manual and automated steering approaches through
a between-subjects, mixed-methods user study with 74 healthcare experts. Our
findings show that manual steering, which grants direct control over training
data, significantly improves model performance while maintaining trust and
system understandability. Based on these findings, we propose design
implications for a hybrid steering system that combines manual and automated
approaches to increase user involvement during human-AI collaboration.

Motivation: 晕动症是VR广泛采用的主要障碍，尤其是光学流与前庭输入不匹配时会导致感官冲突和不适。

Method: U-MAD通过学习从渲染帧中减弱高强度运动模式，无需网格级编辑或场景特定适配。

Result: 实验表明，U-MAD能持续减少平均光学流并增强时间稳定性，用户研究证实其提高了感知舒适度。

Conclusion: 通过感知引导的光学流调制，U-MAD提供了一种有效且可扩展的方法来改善VR体验。

Abstract: Cybersickness remains a critical barrier to the widespread adoption of
Virtual Reality (VR), particularly in scenarios involving intense or artificial
motion cues. Among the key contributors is excessive optical flow-perceived
visual motion that, when unmatched by vestibular input, leads to sensory
conflict and discomfort. While previous efforts have explored geometric or
hardware based mitigation strategies, such methods often rely on predefined
scene structures, manual tuning, or intrusive equipment. In this work, we
propose U-MAD, a lightweight, real-time, AI-based solution that suppresses
perceptually disruptive optical flow directly at the image level. Unlike prior
handcrafted approaches, this method learns to attenuate high-intensity motion
patterns from rendered frames without requiring mesh-level editing or scene
specific adaptation. Designed as a plug and play module, U-MAD integrates
seamlessly into existing VR pipelines and generalizes well to procedurally
generated environments. The experiments show that U-MAD consistently reduces
average optical flow and enhances temporal stability across diverse scenes. A
user study further confirms that reducing visual motion leads to improved
perceptual comfort and alleviated cybersickness symptoms. These findings
demonstrate that perceptually guided modulation of optical flow provides an
effective and scalable approach to creating more user-friendly immersive
experiences. The code will be released at https://github.com/XXXXX (upon

Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are fundamental for modeling physical
systems, yet solving them in a generic and efficient manner using machine
learning-based approaches remains challenging due to limited multi-input and
multi-scale generalization capabilities, as well as high computational costs.
This paper proposes the Multi-input and Multi-scale Efficient Transformer
(MMET), a novel framework designed to address the above challenges. MMET
decouples mesh and query points as two sequences and feeds them into the
encoder and decoder, respectively, and uses a Gated Condition Embedding (GCE)
layer to embed input variables or functions with varying dimensions, enabling
effective solutions for multi-scale and multi-input problems. Additionally, a
Hilbert curve-based reserialization and patch embedding mechanism decrease the
input length. This significantly reduces the computational cost when dealing
with large-scale geometric models. These innovations enable efficient
representations and support multi-scale resolution queries for large-scale and
multi-input PDE problems. Experimental evaluations on diverse benchmarks
spanning different physical fields demonstrate that MMET outperforms SOTA
methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency. This work highlights the
potential of MMET as a robust and scalable solution for real-time PDE solving
in engineering and physics-based applications, paving the way for future
explorations into pre-trained large-scale models in specific domains. This work

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为PCaM的渐进式聚焦交叉注意力机制，用于解决无监督域适应中前景对象不匹配的问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉变换器的无监督域适应方法在前景对象大小和空间分布不一致时，注意力一致性较差，影响域对齐效果。

Method: 提出PCaM机制，逐步过滤背景信息，聚焦前景语义，并引入注意力引导损失增强跨域注意力一致性。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，PCaM显著提升了适应性能，并取得了新的最优结果。

Conclusion: PCaM通过注意力引导的前景融合，有效解决了域适应中的前景不匹配问题，具有轻量化和通用性。

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a
labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Recent UDA methods based
on Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved strong performance through
attention-based feature alignment. However, we identify a key limitation:
foreground object mismatch, where the discrepancy in foreground object size and
spatial distribution across domains weakens attention consistency and hampers
effective domain alignment. To address this issue, we propose the Progressive
Focus Cross-Attention Mechanism (PCaM), which progressively filters out
background information during cross-attention, allowing the model to focus on
and fuse discriminative foreground semantics across domains. We further
introduce an attentional guidance loss that explicitly directs attention toward
task-relevant regions, enhancing cross-domain attention consistency. PCaM is
lightweight, architecture-agnostic, and easy to integrate into existing
ViT-based UDA pipelines. Extensive experiments on Office-Home, DomainNet,
VisDA-2017, and remote sensing datasets demonstrate that PCaM significantly
improves adaptation performance and achieves new state-of-the-art results,
validating the effectiveness of attention-guided foreground fusion for domain
adaptation.

Abstract: The task of data integration for multi-omics data has emerged as a powerful
strategy to unravel the complex biological underpinnings of cancer. Recent
advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs) offer an effective framework to
model heterogeneous and structured omics data, enabling precise representation
of molecular interactions and regulatory networks. This systematic review
explores several recent studies that leverage GNN-based architectures in
multi-omics cancer research. We classify the approaches based on their targeted
omics layers, graph neural network structures, and biological tasks such as
subtype classification, prognosis prediction, and biomarker discovery. The
analysis reveals a growing trend toward hybrid and interpretable models,
alongside increasing adoption of attention mechanisms and contrastive learning.
Furthermore, we highlight the use of patient-specific graphs and
knowledge-driven priors as emerging directions. This survey serves as a
comprehensive resource for researchers aiming to design effective GNN-based
pipelines for integrative cancer analysis, offering insights into current
practices, limitations, and potential future directions.

Result: 模型在分子设计任务上优于通用化学模型、前沿模型和人类专家，且数据效率更高。

Conclusion: 该方法可推广至其他科学领域，训练高效的专业化语言模型。

Abstract: Reasoning models are large language models that emit a long chain-of-thought
before answering, providing both higher accuracy and explicit reasoning for
their response. A major question has been whether language model reasoning
generalizes beyond mathematics, programming, and logic, where most previous
work has focused. We demonstrate that reasoning models can be post-trained for
chemistry without additional domain pretraining, and require substantially less
data compared to contemporary domain-specific models. We report ether0, a 24B
parameter LLM (based on Mistral-Small-24B) that can reason in natural language
and respond with chemical structures. This reasoning model was trained with
reinforcement learning on 640,730 experimentally-grounded chemistry problems
across 375 tasks ranging from synthesizability, to blood-brain barrier
permeability, to human receptor activity, to scent. Our model exceeds
general-purpose chemistry models, frontier models, and human experts on
molecular design tasks. It is also more data efficient relative to specialized
models. We anticipate that this method can be applied to train data-efficient
language models specialized for tasks across a wide variety of scientific
domains.

*Andrew B. Kahng,Yiting Liu,Zhiang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MLBuf-RePlAce是一种基于学习的虚拟缓冲感知全局布局框架，显著提升了时序闭合性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代技术节点中互连延迟与单元延迟的不均衡缩放，使得缓冲孔隙感知的布局对时序闭合至关重要。现有方法存在计算成本高或缺乏对电气规则检查（ERC）的全面考虑。

Method: MLBuf-RePlAce采用递归学习生成缓冲预测方法，结合OpenROAD基础设施，预测缓冲类型和位置，并在全局布局中解决ERC违规问题。

Result: 在OpenROAD流程中，MLBuf-RePlAce在不影响路由后功耗的情况下，总负松弛（TNS）最大提升56%，平均提升31%。在商用流程中，TNS最大提升53%，平均提升28%，且路由后功耗平均提升0.2%。

Conclusion: MLBuf-RePlAce是一种高效且开源的解决方案，显著改进了时序驱动的全局布局性能。

Abstract: Due to the skewed scaling of interconnect versus cell delay in modern
technology nodes, placement with buffer porosity (i.e., cell density) awareness
is essential for timing closure in physical synthesis flows. However, existing
approaches face two key challenges: (i) traditional van Ginneken-Lillis-style
buffering approaches are computationally expensive during global placement; and
(ii) machine learning-based approaches, such as BufFormer, lack a thorough
consideration of Electrical Rule Check (ERC) violations and fail to "close the
loop" back into the physical design flow. In this work, we propose
MLBuf-RePlAce, the first open-source learning-driven virtual buffering-aware
analytical global placement framework, built on top of the OpenROAD
infrastructure. MLBuf-RePlAce adopts an efficient recursive learning-based
generative buffering approach to predict buffer types and locations, addressing
ERC violations during global placement. We compare MLBuf-RePlAce against the
default virtual buffering-based timing-driven global placer in OpenROAD, using
open-source testcases from the TILOS MacroPlacement and OpenROAD-flow-scripts
repositories. Without degradation of post-route power, MLBuf-RePlAce achieves
(maximum, average) improvements of (56%, 31%) in total negative slack (TNS)
within the open-source OpenROAD flow. When evaluated by completion in a
commercial flow, MLBuf-RePlAce achieves (maximum, average) improvements of
(53%, 28%) in TNS with an average of 0.2% improvement in post-route power.

Conclusion: 梯度控制器在多智能体对抗性环境中表现良好，且智能体数量对个体后悔影响有限。

Abstract: Multi-agent control problems involving a large number of agents with
competing and time-varying objectives are increasingly prevalent in
applications across robotics, economics, and energy systems. In this paper, we
study online control in multi-agent linear dynamical systems with disturbances.
In contrast to most prior work in multi-agent control, we consider an online
setting where disturbances are adversarial and where each agent seeks to
minimize its own, adversarial sequence of convex losses. In this setting, we
investigate the robustness of gradient-based controllers from single-agent
online control, with a particular focus on understanding how individual regret
guarantees are influenced by the number of agents in the system. Under minimal
communication assumptions, we prove near-optimal sublinear regret bounds that
hold uniformly for all agents. Finally, when the objectives of the agents are
aligned, we show that the multi-agent control problem induces a time-varying
potential game for which we derive equilibrium gap guarantees.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验验证了LSMI的精确性和效率，揭示了细粒度的样本和类别动态。

Conclusion: LSMI为多模态数据分析提供了实用工具，支持冗余样本分区、知识蒸馏和模型集成等应用。

Abstract: Interactions between modalities -- redundancy, uniqueness, and synergy --
collectively determine the composition of multimodal information. Understanding
these interactions is crucial for analyzing information dynamics in multimodal
systems, yet their accurate sample-level quantification presents significant
theoretical and computational challenges. To address this, we introduce the
Lightweight Sample-wise Multimodal Interaction (LSMI) estimator, rigorously
grounded in pointwise information theory. We first develop a redundancy
estimation framework, employing an appropriate pointwise information measure to
quantify this most decomposable and measurable interaction. Building upon this,
we propose a general interaction estimation method that employs efficient
entropy estimation, specifically tailored for sample-wise estimation in
continuous distributions. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets validate LSMI's precision and efficiency. Crucially, our sample-wise
approach reveals fine-grained sample- and category-level dynamics within
multimodal data, enabling practical applications such as redundancy-informed
sample partitioning, targeted knowledge distillation, and interaction-aware
model ensembling. The code is available at

Conclusion: MATWM在多智能体任务中实现了最先进的性能，各组件对协作任务有显著贡献。

Abstract: We present the Multi-Agent Transformer World Model (MATWM), a novel
transformer-based world model designed for multi-agent reinforcement learning
in both vector- and image-based environments. MATWM combines a decentralized
imagination framework with a semi-centralized critic and a teammate prediction
module, enabling agents to model and anticipate the behavior of others under
partial observability. To address non-stationarity, we incorporate a
prioritized replay mechanism that trains the world model on recent experiences,
allowing it to adapt to agents' evolving policies. We evaluated MATWM on a
broad suite of benchmarks, including the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge,
PettingZoo, and MeltingPot. MATWM achieves state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming both model-free and prior world model approaches, while
demonstrating strong sample efficiency, achieving near-optimal performance in
as few as 50K environment interactions. Ablation studies confirm the impact of
each component, with substantial gains in coordination-heavy tasks.

*Jianing He,Qi Zhang,Duoqian Miao,Yi Kun,Shufeng Hao,Hongyun Zhang,Zhihua Wei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Certainty-Aware Probability (CAP)的新型早退方法，通过整合类相关和类无关信息来更准确地估计预测确定性，从而提升早退决策的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有早退方法仅依赖类相关logits估计预测确定性，忽略了类无关信息对确定性的负面影响，导致过早退出错误预测样本。

Method: 定义了NSP分数来量化类无关信息比例，并基于此提出CAP分数，结合logits和NSP分数来优化预测确定性估计。

Result: 在GLUE基准测试中，平均加速比为2.19倍，性能损失可忽略，优于现有方法ConsistentEE 28%。

Conclusion: CAP方法在任务性能和推理效率之间实现了更好的平衡，代码已开源。

Abstract: Early exiting has demonstrated great potential in accelerating the inference
of pre-trained language models (PLMs) by enabling easy samples to exit at
shallow layers, eliminating the need for executing deeper layers. However,
existing early exiting methods primarily rely on class-relevant logits to
formulate their exiting signals for estimating prediction certainty, neglecting
the detrimental influence of class-irrelevant information in the features on
prediction certainty. This leads to an overestimation of prediction certainty,
causing premature exiting of samples with incorrect early predictions. To
remedy this, we define an NSP score to estimate prediction certainty by
considering the proportion of class-irrelevant information in the features. On
this basis, we propose a novel early exiting method based on the
Certainty-Aware Probability (CAP) score, which integrates insights from both
logits and the NSP score to enhance prediction certainty estimation, thus
enabling more reliable exiting decisions. The experimental results on the GLUE
benchmark show that our method can achieve an average speed-up ratio of 2.19x
across all tasks with negligible performance degradation, surpassing the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) ConsistentEE by 28%, yielding a better trade-off
between task performance and inference efficiency. The code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种稀疏攻击方法，通过优化初始扰动的幅度和稀疏性，克服现有方法的不足，实现了快速、可迁移且强力的攻击，同时提升了对抗样本的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏攻击方法在稀疏性、计算开销、迁移性和攻击强度方面存在不足，难以生成可解释的对抗样本。本文旨在开发一种新的稀疏攻击方法，以更好地理解卷积神经网络（CNN）的脆弱性。

Method: 引入了一种理论可靠的参数化技术，近似解决NP难的l0优化问题，并设计了一种新的损失函数，同时最大化对抗性和最小化扰动像素数量。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在计算开销、迁移性和攻击强度上优于现有稀疏攻击方法，并生成了更稀疏的对抗样本，发现了两种噪声类型（“遮蔽噪声”和“引导噪声”）。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅为评估DNN鲁棒性提供了基准，还通过理论分析和实验结果揭示了对抗扰动如何误导分类器，增强了对抗样本的可解释性。

Abstract: Sparse attacks are to optimize the magnitude of adversarial perturbations for
fooling deep neural networks (DNNs) involving only a few perturbed pixels
(i.e., under the l0 constraint), suitable for interpreting the vulnerability of
DNNs. However, existing solutions fail to yield interpretable adversarial
examples due to their poor sparsity. Worse still, they often struggle with
heavy computational overhead, poor transferability, and weak attack strength.
In this paper, we aim to develop a sparse attack for understanding the
vulnerability of CNNs by minimizing the magnitude of initial perturbations
under the l0 constraint, to overcome the existing drawbacks while achieving a
fast, transferable, and strong attack to DNNs. In particular, a novel and
theoretical sound parameterization technique is introduced to approximate the
NP-hard l0 optimization problem, making directly optimizing sparse
perturbations computationally feasible. Besides, a novel loss function is
designed to augment initial perturbations by maximizing the adversary property
and minimizing the number of perturbed pixels simultaneously. Extensive
experiments are conducted to demonstrate that our approach, with theoretical
performance guarantees, outperforms state-of-the-art sparse attacks in terms of
computational overhead, transferability, and attack strength, expecting to
serve as a benchmark for evaluating the robustness of DNNs. In addition,
theoretical and empirical results validate that our approach yields sparser
adversarial examples, empowering us to discover two categories of noises, i.e.,
"obscuring noise" and "leading noise", which will help interpret how
adversarial perturbation misleads the classifiers into incorrect predictions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Referi的新框架，通过复用少样本示例来验证LLM输出，无需额外训练即可显著提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM推理过程的随机性和结论不一致性问题，避免现有方法（如多数投票或Best-of-N）的局限性和额外成本。

Method: 利用少样本示例评估候选输出，结合两种基于贝叶斯规则的评分，通过少量额外LLM推理选择最佳答案。

Result: 在七个不同任务和三种LLM上的实验显示，平均准确率提升4.8%。

Conclusion: Referi框架通过有效响应选择显著提升LLM性能，无需额外训练。

Abstract: Although LLMs have achieved remarkable performance, the inherent
stochasticity of their reasoning process and varying conclusions present
significant challenges. Majority voting or Best-of-N with external verification
models has been explored to find the most promising solution among multiple LLM
outputs. However, these approaches have certain limitations, such as limited
applicability or the cost of an additional training step. To address this
problem, we propose a novel and effective framework that Recycles Few-shot
examples to verify LLM outputs (Referi). Our key idea is to additionally
utilize the given few-shot examples to evaluate the candidate outputs of the
target query, not only using them to generate outputs as the conventional
few-shot prompting setup. Specifically, Referi evaluates the generated outputs
by combining two different scores, designed motivated from Bayes' rule, and
subsequently selects the candidate that is both confidently determined and
contextually coherent through a few additional LLM inferences. Experiments with
three different LLMs and across seven diverse tasks demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves the accuracy of LLMs-achieving an average gain
of 4.8%-through effective response selection, without additional training.

Motivation: DPO的性能依赖于人类偏好数据的质量，现有方法忽视了模型状态的变化对数据选择的影响。

Method: 提出Sample Scheduling for DPO问题，并设计SamS算法，动态选择训练样本以最大化泛化性能。

Result: 在不修改DPO核心算法的情况下，SamS显著提升了任务性能，且计算开销极小。

Conclusion: SamS为通过更有效利用固定偏好数据集改进LLM对齐提供了新方向。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an effective approach for
aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, its
performance is highly dependent on the quality of the underlying human
preference data. To address this bottleneck, prior work has explored various
data selection strategies, but these methods often overlook the impact of the
evolving states of the language model during the DPO process. %including active
querying, response pair selection, and data pre-selection. In this paper, we
introduce a novel problem: Sample Scheduling for DPO, which aims to dynamically
and adaptively schedule training samples based on the model's evolving states
throughout preference optimization. To solve this problem, we propose SamS, an
efficient and effective algorithm that adaptively selects samples in each
training batch based on the LLM's learning feedback to maximize the potential
generalization performance. Notably, without modifying the core DPO algorithm,
simply integrating SamS significantly improves performance across tasks, with
minimal additional computational overhead. This work points to a promising new
direction for improving LLM alignment through more effective utilization of
fixed preference datasets.

Method: StageRoute分两步：(i) 乐观选择模型，(ii) 预算约束下路由查询。

Result: 理论证明StageRoute的遗憾为$T^{2/3}$，实验验证其接近最优性能。

Conclusion: StageRoute在理论和实践中均表现优异，适用于LLM服务管理。

Abstract: The rapid pace at which new large language models (LLMs) appear -- and older
ones become obsolete -- forces LLM service providers to juggle a streaming
inventory of models while respecting tight deployment capacity and per-query
cost budgets. We cast the reality as an online decision problem that couples
stage-wise deployment, made at fixed maintenance windows, with per-query
routing among the models kept live. We introduce StageRoute, a hierarchical
algorithm that (i) optimistically selects up to $M_max$ models for the next
stage using reward upper-confidence and cost lower-confidence bounds, then (ii)
solves a budget-constrained bandit sub-problem to route each incoming query. We
prove that StageRoute achieves a regret of order $T^{2/3}$ and provide a
matching lower bound, thereby establishing its near-optimality. Moreover, our
experiments confirm the theory, demonstrating that StageRoute performs close to
the optimum in practical settings.

TL;DR: UltraSketchLLM 是一种基于数据草图的无索引框架，实现超低比特压缩（低至 0.5 比特/权重），同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的快速增长超过了边缘设备的内存限制，需要超越 1 比特极限的极端权重压缩。

Method: 利用数据草图技术，通过低估 AbsMaxMin 草图最小化小权重的相对误差，重要性感知空间分配优先处理显著权重，以及直通估计器进行压缩感知微调。

Result: 在 Llama-3.2-1B 上实现 0.5 比特压缩，同时保持竞争力困惑度，延迟开销可接受。

Conclusion: UltraSketchLLM 为资源受限环境中的 LLM 部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has outpaced the memory
constraints of edge devices, necessitating extreme weight compression beyond
the 1-bit limit. While quantization reduces model size, it is fundamentally
limited to 1 bit per weight. Existing multiple-to-one compression methods
either rely on mapping tables (inducing memory overhead) or incur severe
accuracy degradation due to random weight grouping. We introduce
UltraSketchLLM, an index-free, sketch-based framework that achieves ultra-low
bit compression (down to 0.5 bits per weight) while preserving model
performance. UltraSketchLLM leverages data sketching, a sub-linear
representation technique from streaming applications, to map multiple weights
to single values with bounded error. Our approach integrates an underestimate
AbsMaxMin sketch to minimize relative errors for small weights,
importance-aware space allocation to prioritize salient weights, and a
straight-through estimator for compression-aware finetuning. Experiments on
Llama-3.2-1B demonstrate up to 0.5-bit compression with competitive perplexity,
alongside tolerable latency overhead. UltraSketchLLM offers a practical
solution for deploying LLMs in resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: 研究评估视神经头（ONH）生物力学是否改善青光眼三种进展性视野缺损模式的预测，并利用可解释AI识别关键应变敏感区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 青光眼视野缺损的预测通常依赖形态学特征，但生物力学因素的作用尚不明确。研究旨在探索ONH应变对预测的贡献。

Method: 237名青光眼患者参与，通过眼压动态测量获取ONH应变数据，结合几何深度学习模型进行分类任务，并利用可解释AI技术分析关键区域。

Result: 模型AUC达0.77-0.88，表明ONH应变显著提升预测性能。下部和下颞侧缘是关键应变敏感区域。

Conclusion: ONH应变可增强青光眼视野缺损预测，神经视网膜缘是预测中最关键的区域。

Abstract: Objective: (1) To assess whether ONH biomechanics improves prediction of
three progressive visual field loss patterns in glaucoma; (2) to use
explainable AI to identify strain-sensitive ONH regions contributing to these
predictions.
  Methods: We recruited 237 glaucoma subjects. The ONH of one eye was imaged
under two conditions: (1) primary gaze and (2) primary gaze with IOP elevated
to ~35 mmHg via ophthalmo-dynamometry. Glaucoma experts classified the subjects
into four categories based on the presence of specific visual field defects:
(1) superior nasal step (N=26), (2) superior partial arcuate (N=62), (3) full
superior hemifield defect (N=25), and (4) other/non-specific defects (N=124).
Automatic ONH tissue segmentation and digital volume correlation were used to
compute IOP-induced neural tissue and lamina cribrosa (LC) strains.
Biomechanical and structural features were input to a Geometric Deep Learning
model. Three classification tasks were performed to detect: (1) superior nasal
step, (2) superior partial arcuate, (3) full superior hemifield defect. For
each task, the data were split into 80% training and 20% testing sets. Area
under the curve (AUC) was used to assess performance. Explainable AI techniques
were employed to highlight the ONH regions most critical to each
classification.
  Results: Models achieved high AUCs of 0.77-0.88, showing that ONH strain
improved VF loss prediction beyond morphology alone. The inferior and
inferotemporal rim were identified as key strain-sensitive regions,
contributing most to visual field loss prediction and showing progressive
expansion with increasing disease severity.
  Conclusion and Relevance: ONH strain enhances prediction of glaucomatous VF
loss patterns. Neuroretinal rim, rather than the LC, was the most critical
region contributing to model predictions.

TL;DR: 研究资源限制（尤其是内存限制）对强化学习代理在未知环境中性能的影响，探讨内存分配对模型估计和规划的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 资源限制会显著改变学习和决策过程，尤其是在内存受限的情况下，代理需要在模型估计和规划之间权衡内存分配。

Method: 在MCTS和DQN算法中研究不同内存分配策略，分析其对情景学习和持续学习性能的影响。

Result: 不同内存分配策略对代理性能有显著影响，尤其是在情景学习和持续学习任务中。

Conclusion: 内存分配策略是影响强化学习代理性能的关键因素，需根据任务类型优化内存使用。

Abstract: Resource constraints can fundamentally change both learning and
decision-making. We explore how memory constraints influence an agent's
performance when navigating unknown environments using standard reinforcement
learning algorithms. Specifically, memory-constrained agents face a dilemma:
how much of their limited memory should be allocated to each of the agent's
internal processes, such as estimating a world model, as opposed to forming a
plan using that model? We study this dilemma in MCTS- and DQN-based algorithms
and examine how different allocations of memory impact performance in episodic
and continual learning settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OAT-Rephrase是一种优化感知的训练数据重述策略，通过LLM重述训练实例以改进零阶优化（ZO）微调性能，缩小与一阶方法的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零阶优化（ZO）在微调大型语言模型（LLM）时内存效率高，但收敛慢且优化不稳定。本文旨在通过优化感知的数据重述策略解决这些问题。

Method: 提出OAT-Rephrase，采用双阶段流水线（重述LLM和语义判断器），确保重述内容保留任务相关性和逻辑一致性。

Result: 在五个分类任务和三种LLM架构上的评估表明，OAT-Rephrase显著提升了MeZO微调性能，接近或达到一阶方法水平。

Conclusion: 优化感知的数据重述是一种可重用且低开销的增强方法，适用于零阶优化微调场景。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using zeroth-order optimization (ZO)
offers a memory-efficient alternative to gradient-based methods but suffers
from slower convergence and unstable optimization due to noisy gradient
estimates. This paper introduces OAT-Rephrase, an Optimization-Aware Training
data rephrasing strategy that leverages an LLM to rephrase training instances
based on its understanding of the ZO dynamics, specifically MeZO, derived
directly from its paper. The approach incorporates a dual-stage pipeline
featuring a rewriter LLM and a semantic judge, ensuring all rephrasings retain
task relevance and logical consistency. Evaluations across five classification
tasks and three LLM architectures demonstrate that OAT-Rephrase consistently
improves MeZO fine-tuning performance, often narrowing or eliminating the gap
with first-order methods. Our findings suggest that optimization-aware
rephrasing serves as a reusable and low-overhead enhancement for zeroth-order
tuning regimes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种针对多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的遗忘攻击方法（SUA），通过生成通用噪声模式恢复被遗忘的敏感信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs可能记忆敏感信息，现有遗忘方法无法确保信息被真正遗忘，因此研究如何恢复被遗忘知识。

Method: 提出SUA框架，学习通用噪声模式，通过嵌入对齐损失提高攻击的隐蔽性。

Result: SUA能有效恢复MLLMs中被遗忘的信息，且噪声模式具有泛化能力。

Conclusion: 知识重现是MLLMs的普遍行为，而非偶然现象。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) trained on massive data may memorize
sensitive personal information and photos, posing serious privacy risks. To
mitigate this, MLLM unlearning methods are proposed, which fine-tune MLLMs to
reduce the ``forget'' sensitive information. However, it remains unclear
whether the knowledge has been truly forgotten or just hidden in the model.
Therefore, we propose to study a novel problem of LLM unlearning attack, which
aims to recover the unlearned knowledge of an unlearned LLM. To achieve the
goal, we propose a novel framework Stealthy Unlearning Attack (SUA) framework
that learns a universal noise pattern. When applied to input images, this noise
can trigger the model to reveal unlearned content. While pixel-level
perturbations may be visually subtle, they can be detected in the semantic
embedding space, making such attacks vulnerable to potential defenses. To
improve stealthiness, we introduce an embedding alignment loss that minimizes
the difference between the perturbed and denoised image embeddings, ensuring
the attack is semantically unnoticeable. Experimental results show that SUA can
effectively recover unlearned information from MLLMs. Furthermore, the learned
noise generalizes well: a single perturbation trained on a subset of samples
can reveal forgotten content in unseen images. This indicates that knowledge
reappearance is not an occasional failure, but a consistent behavior.

TL;DR: CF-VLM通过引入反事实样本增强视觉语言模型的因果推理能力，显著提升了细粒度判别和深度因果推理任务的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）在细粒度判别和深度因果推理任务中存在局限性，主要依赖表面统计相关性，缺乏捕捉视觉与文本内容间因果逻辑的能力。

Method: 提出CF-VLM框架，通过三种互补的训练目标：保持跨模态对齐基础、强化事实场景表示的唯一性和稳定性、提升模型对关键因果编辑的敏感性。

Result: CF-VLM在组合推理和泛化基准测试中表现优于现有方法，并能有效减少视觉幻觉，提高事实一致性。

Conclusion: CF-VLM为高风险的现实场景提供了可靠的推理和可解释性基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have greatly improved
cross-modal semantic understanding, yet significant limitations remain in
fine-grained discrimination and deep causal reasoning tasks. Existing VLMs
often rely on superficial statistical correlations, lacking the ability to
capture the underlying causal logic between visual and textual content. To
address this, we propose CounterFactual Vision-Language Fine-tuning (CF-VLM), a
novel framework that enhances the causal reasoning capabilities of VLMs through
the targeted use of counterfactual samples. CF-VLM introduces three
complementary training objectives: maintaining foundational cross-modal
alignment, reinforcing the uniqueness and stability of factual scene
representations against coherent counterfactuals, and sharpening the model's
sensitivity to minimal but critical causal edits. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CF-VLM consistently outperforms strong baselines and
state-of-the-art methods on compositional reasoning and generalization
benchmarks. Furthermore, it shows promise in mitigating visual hallucinations,
indicating improved factual consistency. Our CF-VLM provides a robust
foundation for deploying VLMs in high-stakes, real-world scenarios requiring
reliable reasoning and interpretability.

Abstract: We introduce SafeRL-Lite, an open-source Python library for building
reinforcement learning (RL) agents that are both constrained and explainable.
Existing RL toolkits often lack native mechanisms for enforcing hard safety
constraints or producing human-interpretable rationales for decisions.
SafeRL-Lite provides modular wrappers around standard Gym environments and deep
Q-learning agents to enable: (i) safety-aware training via constraint
enforcement, and (ii) real-time post-hoc explanation via SHAP values and
saliency maps. The library is lightweight, extensible, and installable via pip,
and includes built-in metrics for constraint violations. We demonstrate its
effectiveness on constrained variants of CartPole and provide visualizations
that reveal both policy logic and safety adherence. The full codebase is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有度量模型在推理时仅利用支持样本进行相似性比较，未能充分利用其优化度量空间的潜力，导致性能受限。

Method: 提出了旋转分割微调（RDFT）及其变体（IDFT、ADFT），构造伪支持-查询对进行推理时微调，并结合优化元学习框架避免过拟合。

Result: 在三个音频数据集（ESC-50、Speech Commands V2、Medley-solos-DB）上验证，性能显著提升，尤其适用于基于注意力的模型。

Conclusion: 结合推理时微调和元学习框架，度量模型能快速适应少样本任务并避免过拟合，具有跨领域泛化能力。

Abstract: In few-shot classification tasks (so-called episodes), a small set of labeled
support samples is provided during inference to aid the classification of
unlabeled query samples. Metric-based models typically operate by computing
similarities between query and support embeddings within a learned metric
space, followed by nearest-neighbor classification. However, these labeled
support samples are often underutilized--they are only used for similarity
comparison, despite their potential to fine-tune and adapt the metric space
itself to the classes in the current episode. To address this, we propose a
series of simple yet effective episode-specific, during-inference fine-tuning
methods for metric-based models, including Rotational Division Fine-Tuning
(RDFT) and its two variants, Iterative Division Fine-Tuning (IDFT) and
Augmented Division Fine-Tuning (ADFT). These methods construct pseudo
support-query pairs from the given support set to enable fine-tuning even for
non-parametric models. Nevertheless, the severely limited amount of data in
each task poses a substantial risk of overfitting when applying such
fine-tuning strategies. To mitigate this, we further propose to train the
metric-based model within an optimization-based meta-learning framework. With
the combined efforts of episode-specific fine-tuning and optimization-based
meta-training, metric-based models are equipped with the ability to rapidly
adapt to the limited support samples during inference while avoiding
overfitting. We validate our approach on three audio datasets from diverse
domains, namely ESC-50 (environmental sounds), Speech Commands V2 (spoken
keywords), and Medley-solos-DB (musical instrument). Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach consistently improves performance for all
evaluated metric-based models (especially for attention-based models) and
generalizes well across different audio domains.

TL;DR: AlgoSelect是一个基于Comb Operator的框架，用于从数据中学习最优算法选择，具有理论上的普适性、信息论最优性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决算法选择问题，通过数据驱动的方法学习如何在不同算法之间进行插值，以实现最优选择。

Method: 引入Comb Operator，包括简单sigmoid门控选择器和N-Path Comb扩展，支持多算法选择。理论贡献包括普适逼近定理、信息论可学习性、线性算子理论形式化等。

Result: 在20×20问题-算法研究中实现了99.9%以上的选择准确率，样本需求少且收敛快。

Conclusion: AlgoSelect为自动化算法选择提供了理论支持与实践解决方案，对AI和自适应系统有重要意义。

Abstract: We introduce AlgoSelect, a principled framework for learning optimal
algorithm selection from data, centered around the novel Comb Operator. Given a
set of algorithms and a feature representation of problems, AlgoSelect learns
to interpolate between diverse computational approaches. For pairs of
algorithms, a simple sigmoid-gated selector, an instance of the Comb Operator,
facilitates this interpolation. We extend this to an N-Path Comb for multiple
algorithms. We prove that this framework is universal (can approximate any
algorithm selector), information-theoretically optimal in its learnability
(thresholds for selection converge almost surely, demonstrated via
Borel-Cantelli arguments), computationally efficient, and robust. Key
theoretical contributions include: (1) a universal approximation theorem
demonstrating that Comb-based selectors can achieve arbitrary accuracy; (2)
information-theoretic learnability for selection thresholds; (3) formalization
of the Comb Operator within linear operator theory, detailing its boundedness
and spectral properties; (4) an N-Path Comb generalization for multi-algorithm
selection; and (5) a practical learning framework for the adaptive seeding
functions that guide the Comb Operator. Empirical validation on a comprehensive
20$\times$20 problem-algorithm study demonstrates near-perfect selection
(99.9\%+ accuracy) with remarkably few samples and rapid convergence, revealing
that $H(\text{Algorithm}|\text{Problem}) \approx 0$ in structured domains.
AlgoSelect provides a theoretically grounded, practically deployable solution
to automated algorithm selection with provable optimality and learnability
guarantees, with significant implications for AI and adaptive systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新方法，通过在输入空间直接学习来补充CLIP的先验知识，以解决少样本测试时域适应问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖CLIP的特征空间知识，但其性能受限于CLIP的先验知识，尤其是在使用较弱骨干网络时表现显著下降。

Method: 引入一个独立的侧分支与CLIP并行，通过反向注意力学习专属知识，并通过贪婪文本集成和细化增强文本特征。

Result: 在5个大规模基准测试中表现优异，显著提升了ViT-B/16等较小网络的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过直接学习和特征融合，有效提升了少样本测试时域适应的性能。

Abstract: Few-shot Test-Time Domain Adaptation focuses on adapting a model at test time
to a specific domain using only a few unlabeled examples, addressing domain
shift. Prior methods leverage CLIP's strong out-of-distribution (OOD) abilities
by generating domain-specific prompts to guide its generalized, frozen
features. However, since downstream datasets are not explicitly seen by CLIP,
solely depending on the feature space knowledge is constrained by CLIP's prior
knowledge. Notably, when using a less robust backbone like ViT-B/16,
performance significantly drops on challenging real-world benchmarks. Departing
from the state-of-the-art of inheriting the intrinsic OOD capability of CLIP,
this work introduces learning directly on the input space to complement the
dataset-specific knowledge for frozen CLIP. Specifically, an independent side
branch is attached in parallel with CLIP and enforced to learn exclusive
knowledge via revert attention. To better capture the dataset-specific label
semantics for downstream adaptation, we propose to enhance the inter-dispersion
among text features via greedy text ensemble and refinement. The text and
visual features are then progressively fused in a domain-aware manner by a
generated domain prompt to adapt toward a specific domain. Extensive
experiments show our method's superiority on 5 large-scale benchmarks (WILDS
and DomainNet), notably improving over smaller networks like ViT-B/16 with
gains of \textbf{+5.1} in F1 for iWildCam and \textbf{+3.1\%} in WC Acc for
FMoW.

Conclusion: CodeT5-Authorship在识别LLM生成的C程序来源方面表现优异。

Abstract: Detecting AI-generated code, deepfakes, and other synthetic content is an
emerging research challenge. As code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs)
becomes more common, identifying the specific model behind each sample is
increasingly important. This paper presents the first systematic study of LLM
authorship attribution for C programs. We released CodeT5-Authorship, a novel
model that uses only the encoder layers from the original CodeT5
encoder-decoder architecture, discarding the decoder to focus on
classification. Our model's encoder output (first token) is passed through a
two-layer classification head with GELU activation and dropout, producing a
probability distribution over possible authors. To evaluate our approach, we
introduce LLM-AuthorBench, a benchmark of 32,000 compilable C programs
generated by eight state-of-the-art LLMs across diverse tasks. We compare our
model to seven traditional ML classifiers and eight fine-tuned transformer
models, including BERT, RoBERTa, CodeBERT, ModernBERT, DistilBERT, DeBERTa-V3,
Longformer, and LoRA-fine-tuned Qwen2-1.5B. In binary classification, our model
achieves 97.56% accuracy in distinguishing C programs generated by closely
related models such as GPT-4.1 and GPT-4o, and 95.40% accuracy for multi-class
attribution among five leading LLMs (Gemini 2.5 Flash, Claude 3.5 Haiku,
GPT-4.1, Llama 3.3, and DeepSeek-V3). To support open science, we release the
CodeT5-Authorship architecture, the LLM-AuthorBench benchmark, and all relevant

Result: 理论表明自注意力能促进局部特征的全局一致性，实验验证了这一行为。

Conclusion: 自注意力在扩散模型中起到了关键作用，增强了生成图像的全局一致性。

Abstract: As diffusion models have become the tool of choice for image generation and
as the quality of the images continues to improve, the question of how
`creativity' originates in diffusion has become increasingly important. The
score matching perspective on diffusion has proven particularly fruitful for
understanding how and why diffusion models generate images that remain
plausible while differing significantly from their training images. In
particular, as explained in (Kamb \& Ganguli, 2024) and others, e.g.,
(Ambrogioni, 2023), theory suggests that if our score matching were optimal, we
would only be able to recover training samples through our diffusion process.
However, as shown by Kamb \& Ganguli, (2024), in diffusion models where the
score is parametrized by a simple CNN, the inductive biases of the CNN itself
(translation equivariance and locality) allow the model to generate samples
that globally do not match any training samples, but are rather patch-wise
`mosaics'. Notably, however, this theory does not extend to describe the role
of self-attention in this process. In this work, we take a preliminary step in
this direction to extend this theory to the case of diffusion models whose
score is parametrized by a CNN with a final self-attention layer. We show that
our theory suggests that self-attention will induce a globally image-consistent
arrangement of local features beyond the patch-level in generated samples, and
we verify this behavior empirically on a carefully crafted dataset.

Motivation: 糖尿病早期检测对降低健康风险至关重要，但数据不平衡问题影响了机器学习模型的性能。

Method: 使用A2 copula生成少数类数据，结合四种机器学习算法（逻辑回归、随机森林、梯度提升、XGBoost）进行实验。

Result: XGBoost结合A2 copula在准确率、精确率、召回率、F1分数和AUC上均显著优于SMOTE方法。

Conclusion: A2 copula首次用于数据增强，展示了其在机器学习中的有效性，可作为SMOTE的替代方法。

Abstract: Diabetes mellitus poses a significant health risk, as nearly 1 in 9 people
are affected by it. Early detection can significantly lower this risk. Despite
significant advancements in machine learning for identifying diabetic cases,
results can still be influenced by the imbalanced nature of the data. To
address this challenge, our study considered copula-based data augmentation,
which preserves the dependency structure when generating data for the minority
class and integrates it with machine learning (ML) techniques. We selected the
Pima Indian dataset and generated data using A2 copula, then applied four
machine learning algorithms: logistic regression, random forest, gradient
boosting, and extreme gradient boosting. Our findings indicate that XGBoost
combined with A2 copula oversampling achieved the best performance improving
accuracy by 4.6%, precision by 15.6%, recall by 20.4%, F1-score by 18.2% and
AUC by 25.5% compared to the standard SMOTE method. Furthermore, we
statistically validated our results using the McNemar test. This research
represents the first known use of A2 copulas for data augmentation and serves
as an alternative to the SMOTE technique, highlighting the efficacy of copulas
as a statistical method in machine learning applications.

Motivation: 研究旨在解决自动发现细胞自动机局部更新规则并用于定量预测的挑战。

Method: 使用预训练的Transformer模型（AutomataGPT），基于100种二维二进制确定性CA规则生成的100万条模拟轨迹进行训练。

Result: 模型在新规则上实现了98.5%的一步预测准确率，规则推断的功能准确率达96%，精确规则匹配率为82%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，大规模预训练能在无手工先验的情况下实现CA动态的高效推断，为实际动态现象的建模开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Cellular automata (CA) provide a minimal formalism for investigating how
simple local interactions generate rich spatiotemporal behavior in domains as
diverse as traffic flow, ecology, tissue morphogenesis and crystal growth.
However, automatically discovering the local update rules for a given
phenomenon and using them for quantitative prediction remains challenging. Here
we present AutomataGPT, a decoder-only transformer pretrained on around 1
million simulated trajectories that span 100 distinct two-dimensional binary
deterministic CA rules on toroidal grids. When evaluated on previously unseen
rules drawn from the same CA family, AutomataGPT attains 98.5% perfect one-step
forecasts and reconstructs the governing update rule with up to 96% functional
(application) accuracy and 82% exact rule-matrix match. These results
demonstrate that large-scale pretraining over wider regions of rule space
yields substantial generalization in both the forward (state forecasting) and
inverse (rule inference) problems, without hand-crafted priors. By showing that
transformer models can faithfully infer and execute CA dynamics from data
alone, our work lays the groundwork for abstracting real-world dynamical
phenomena into data-efficient CA surrogates, opening avenues in biology, tissue
engineering, physics and AI-driven scientific discovery.

Motivation: 社交元宇宙中隐私保护和高质量低延迟流媒体的需求是主要挑战。

Method: 提出ASMS系统，基于F-MAPPO（联邦多智能体近端策略优化），结合联邦学习和深度强化学习。

Result: 实验显示ASMS在不同网络条件下比现有方法提升用户体验至少14%。

Conclusion: ASMS在动态和资源受限网络中提供无缝沉浸式流媒体，同时确保用户数据本地化。

Abstract: The social metaverse is a growing digital ecosystem that blends virtual and
physical worlds. It allows users to interact socially, work, shop, and enjoy
entertainment. However, privacy remains a major challenge, as immersive
interactions require continuous collection of biometric and behavioral data. At
the same time, ensuring high-quality, low-latency streaming is difficult due to
the demands of real-time interaction, immersive rendering, and bandwidth
optimization. To address these issues, we propose ASMS (Adaptive Social
Metaverse Streaming), a novel streaming system based on Federated Multi-Agent
Proximal Policy Optimization (F-MAPPO). ASMS leverages F-MAPPO, which
integrates federated learning (FL) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to
dynamically adjust streaming bit rates while preserving user privacy.
Experimental results show that ASMS improves user experience by at least 14%
compared to existing streaming methods across various network conditions.
Therefore, ASMS enhances the social metaverse experience by providing seamless
and immersive streaming, even in dynamic and resource-constrained networks,
while ensuring that sensitive user data remains on local devices.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为FFINO的新型神经算子架构，用于快速模拟地下氢储存（UHS）中的多相流问题，相比现有模型FMIONet，FFINO在参数数量、训练时间和GPU内存成本上均有显著优化，且预测精度更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地下氢储存是低碳经济转型中的重要能源存储方式，快速建模氢羽流迁移和压力场演化对UHS管理至关重要。

Method: 通过参数化实验相对渗透率曲线，并将其作为关键不确定性参数纳入FFINO模型，与FMIONet模型进行多指标对比。

Result: FFINO模型参数减少38.1%，训练时间减少17.6%，GPU内存成本降低12%，预测精度提升9.8%，压力预测RMSE提高18%，推理速度比数值模拟快7850倍。

Conclusion: FFINO模型在UHS问题中具有卓越的时间效率和预测能力，可作为数值模拟的高效替代方案。

Abstract: Underground hydrogen storage (UHS) is a promising energy storage option for
the current energy transition to a low-carbon economy. Fast modeling of
hydrogen plume migration and pressure field evolution is crucial for UHS field
management. In this study, we propose a new neural operator architecture,
FFINO, as a fast surrogate model for multiphase flow problems in UHS. We
parameterize experimental relative permeability curves reported in the
literature and include them as key uncertainty parameters in the FFINO model.
We also compare the FFINO model with the state-of-the-art FMIONet model through
a comprehensive combination of metrics. Our new FFINO model has 38.1% fewer
trainable parameters, 17.6% less training time, and 12% less GPU memory cost
compared to FMIONet. The FFINO model also achieves a 9.8% accuracy improvement
in predicting hydrogen plume in focused areas, and 18% higher RMSE in
predicting pressure buildup. The inference time of the trained FFINO model is
7850 times faster than a numerical simulator, which makes it a competent
substitute for numerical simulations of UHS problems with superior time
efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了基于Mixture-of-Experts（MoE）的大型语言模型的安全对齐问题，提出了SAFEx框架，通过SES算法识别安全关键专家模块，并验证了其对模型安全性的重要影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全对齐策略主要针对密集模型，无法有效应对MoE架构的独特漏洞，尤其是其位置脆弱性问题。

Method: 提出了SAFEx框架和SES算法，用于识别和验证安全关键专家模块，并将其分解为不同功能组。

Result: 实验表明，主流MoE模型（如Qwen3-MoE）的安全机制依赖于少数位置专家模块，禁用这些专家会显著降低模型拒绝有害请求的能力。

Conclusion: MoE模型的安全对齐存在显著的位置脆弱性，少数专家模块对整体安全性具有不成比例的影响。

Abstract: Large language models based on Mixture-of-Experts have achieved substantial
gains in efficiency and scalability, yet their architectural uniqueness
introduces underexplored safety alignment challenges. Existing safety alignment
strategies, predominantly designed for dense models, are ill-suited to address
MoE-specific vulnerabilities. In this work, we formalize and systematically
study MoE model's positional vulnerability - the phenomenon where
safety-aligned behaviors rely on specific expert modules, revealing critical
risks inherent to MoE architectures. To this end, we present SAFEx, an
analytical framework that robustly identifies, characterizes, and validates the
safety-critical experts using a novel Stability-based Expert Selection (SES)
algorithm. Notably, our approach enables the explicit decomposition of
safety-critical experts into distinct functional groups, including those
responsible for harmful content detection and those controlling safe response
generation. Extensive experiments on mainstream MoE models, such as the
recently released Qwen3-MoE, demonstrated that their intrinsic safety
mechanisms heavily rely on a small subset of positional experts. Disabling
these experts significantly compromised the models' ability to refuse harmful
requests. For Qwen3-MoE with 6144 experts (in the FNN layer), we find that
disabling as few as 12 identified safety-critical experts can cause the refusal
rate to drop by 22%, demonstrating the disproportionate impact of a small set
of experts on overall model safety.

TL;DR: 研究表明，推理时计算技术（如解码时缩放和自我优化）能显著提升语言模型的推理能力，但视觉语言模型（VLMs）中这些技术的效果有限，尤其是依赖自我验证的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索推理时计算技术是否适用于视觉语言模型，特别是通过强化学习训练的模型。

Method: 采用解码策略（如多数投票和最佳选择）和自我验证方法，评估其在VLM中的效果。

Result: 依赖生成的方法（如多数投票）比依赖验证的方法表现更好；强化学习训练的VLM缺乏跨模态的自我验证能力。

Conclusion: VLMs在推理时计算技术的应用中仍需改进自我验证能力，尤其是在多模态任务中。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that
inference-time computation techniques, such as decoding-time scaling and
self-refinement, can significantly enhance reasoning capabilities without
relying on external knowledge. A key driver of this success is the emergence of
self-correction and self-verification behaviors, often elicited through
reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we investigate whether these
inference-time techniques extend effectively to vision-language models (VLMs),
particularly those trained with RL. We find that while decoding strategies such
as majority voting and best-of-N selection with self-verification all improve
VLM reasoning performance, generation-reliant methods such as the former
achieve significantly higher gains versus verification-reliant methods such as
the latter. Additionally, the self-correction behavior often associated with
RL-tuned models, such as aha moment, does not lead to measurable gains. We show
via extensive experimentation within the inference-time scaling framework to
identify a key root cause: RL-trained VLMs still lack robust self-verification
capabilities across both visual and textual modalities.

Motivation: 联邦学习在解释性和可解释性方面存在挑战，需要一种既能保护隐私又能提供清晰分析结果的方法。

Conclusion: FedNAMs在隐私保护、模型效率和解释性方面表现优异，适用于金融和医疗等领域。

Abstract: Federated learning continues to evolve but faces challenges in
interpretability and explainability. To address these challenges, we introduce
a novel approach that employs Neural Additive Models (NAMs) within a federated
learning framework. This new Federated Neural Additive Models (FedNAMs)
approach merges the advantages of NAMs, where individual networks concentrate
on specific input features, with the decentralized approach of federated
learning, ultimately producing interpretable analysis results. This integration
enhances privacy by training on local data across multiple devices, thereby
minimizing the risks associated with data centralization and improving model
robustness and generalizability. FedNAMs maintain detailed, feature-specific
learning, making them especially valuable in sectors such as finance and
healthcare. They facilitate the training of client-specific models to integrate
local updates, preserve privacy, and mitigate concerns related to
centralization. Our studies on various text and image classification tasks,
using datasets such as OpenFetch ML Wine, UCI Heart Disease, and Iris, show
that FedNAMs deliver strong interpretability with minimal accuracy loss
compared to traditional Federated Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). The research
involves notable findings, including the identification of critical predictive
features at both client and global levels. Volatile acidity, sulfates, and
chlorides for wine quality. Chest pain type, maximum heart rate, and number of
vessels for heart disease. Petal length and width for iris classification. This
approach strengthens privacy and model efficiency and improves interpretability
and robustness across diverse datasets. Finally, FedNAMs generate insights on
causes of highly and low interpretable features.

Abstract: Low-rank pre-training and fine-tuning have recently emerged as promising
techniques for reducing the computational and storage costs of large neural
networks. Training low-rank parameterizations typically relies on conventional
optimizers such as heavy ball momentum methods or Adam. In this work, we
identify and analyze potential difficulties that these training methods
encounter when used to train low-rank parameterizations of weights. In
particular, we show that classical momentum methods can struggle to converge to
a local optimum due to the geometry of the underlying optimization landscape.
To address this, we introduce novel training strategies derived from dynamical
low-rank approximation, which explicitly account for the underlying geometric
structure. Our approach leverages and combines tools from dynamical low-rank
approximation and momentum-based optimization to design optimizers that respect
the intrinsic geometry of the parameter space. We validate our methods through
numerical experiments, demonstrating faster convergence, and stronger
validation metrics at given parameter budgets.

Abstract: Meta learning aims at learning how to solve tasks, and thus it allows to
estimate models that can be quickly adapted to new scenarios. This work
explores distributionally robust minimization in meta learning for system

overlooking task variability. We use an alternative approach, adopting a
distributionally robust optimization paradigm that prioritizes high-loss tasks,
enhancing performance in worst-case scenarios. Evaluated on a meta model
trained on a class of synthetic dynamical systems and tested in both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, the proposed approach allows

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to predicting buying intent and product
demand in e-commerce settings, leveraging a Deep Q-Network (DQN) inspired
architecture. In the rapidly evolving landscape of online retail, accurate
prediction of user behavior is crucial for optimizing inventory management,
personalizing user experiences, and maximizing sales. Our method adapts
concepts from reinforcement learning to a supervised learning context,
combining the sequential modeling capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
networks with the strategic decision-making aspects of DQNs. We evaluate our
model on a large-scale e-commerce dataset comprising over 885,000 user
sessions, each characterized by 1,114 features. Our approach demonstrates
robust performance in handling the inherent class imbalance typical in
e-commerce data, where purchase events are significantly less frequent than
non-purchase events. Through comprehensive experimentation with various
classification thresholds, we show that our model achieves a balance between
precision and recall, with an overall accuracy of 88\% and an AUC-ROC score of
0.88. Comparative analysis reveals that our DQN-inspired model offers
advantages over traditional machine learning and standard deep learning
approaches, particularly in its ability to capture complex temporal patterns in
user behavior. The model's performance and scalability make it well-suited for
real-world e-commerce applications dealing with high-dimensional, sequential
data. This research contributes to the field of e-commerce analytics by
introducing a novel predictive modeling technique that combines the strengths
of deep learning and reinforcement learning paradigms. Our findings have
significant implications for improving demand forecasting, personalizing user
experiences, and optimizing marketing strategies in online retail environments.

Abstract: A reliable evaluation of surgical difficulty can improve the success of the
treatment for rectal cancer and the current evaluation method is based on
clinical data. However, more data about rectal cancer can be collected with the
development of technology. Meanwhile, with the development of artificial
intelligence, its application in rectal cancer treatment is becoming possible.
In this paper, a multi-view rectal cancer dataset is first constructed to give
a more comprehensive view of patients, including the high-resolution MRI image
view, pressed-fat MRI image view, and clinical data view. Then, an
interpretable incomplete multi-view surgical evaluation model is proposed,
considering that it is hard to obtain extensive and complete patient data in
real application scenarios. Specifically, a dual representation incomplete
multi-view learning model is first proposed to extract the common information
between views and specific information in each view. In this model, the missing
view imputation is integrated into representation learning, and second-order
similarity constraint is also introduced to improve the cooperative learning
between these two parts. Then, based on the imputed multi-view data and the
learned dual representation, a multi-view surgical evaluation model with the
TSK fuzzy system is proposed. In the proposed model, a cooperative learning
mechanism is constructed to explore the consistent information between views,
and Shannon entropy is also introduced to adapt the view weight. On the MVRC
dataset, we compared it with several advanced algorithms and DRIMV_TSK obtained
the best results.

Abstract: Residual Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a popular approach for adapting
pretrained policies by learning a lightweight residual policy that provides
corrective actions. While Residual RL is more sample-efficient than finetuning
the entire base policy, existing methods struggle with sparse rewards and are
designed for deterministic base policies. We propose two improvements to
Residual RL that further enhance its sample efficiency and make it suitable for
stochastic base policies. First, we leverage uncertainty estimates of the base
policy to focus exploration on regions in which the base policy is not
confident. Second, we propose a simple modification to off-policy residual
learning that allows it to observe base actions and better handle stochastic
base policies. We evaluate our method with both Gaussian-based and
Diffusion-based stochastic base policies on tasks from Robosuite and D4RL, and
compare against state-of-the-art finetuning methods, demo-augmented RL methods,
and other residual RL methods. Our algorithm significantly outperforms existing
baselines in a variety of simulation benchmark environments. We also deploy our
learned polices in the real world to demonstrate their robustness with
zero-shot sim-to-real transfer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GCN在深层架构中因线性变换加剧特征崩溃，导致性能下降，而完全移除线性变换又会削弱模型表达能力。

Method: 提出LGT方法，包含层间渐进训练、低秩适应和恒等初始化三个组件，以平衡表达能力和避免过平滑。

Result: 实验表明LGT在32层GCN中显著提升性能，且可与现有方法结合进一步优化。

Conclusion: LGT为深层GCN提供了一种通用的训练框架，解决了表达能力和过平滑的权衡问题。

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) suffer from severe performance
degradation in deep architectures due to over-smoothing. While existing studies
primarily attribute the over-smoothing to repeated applications of graph
Laplacian operators, our empirical analysis reveals a critical yet overlooked
factor: trainable linear transformations in GCNs significantly exacerbate
feature collapse, even at moderate depths (e.g., 8 layers). In contrast,
Simplified Graph Convolution (SGC), which removes these transformations,
maintains stable feature diversity up to 32 layers, highlighting linear
transformations' dual role in facilitating expressive power and inducing
over-smoothing. However, completely removing linear transformations weakens the
model's expressive capacity.
  To address this trade-off, we propose Layer-wise Gradual Training (LGT), a
novel training strategy that progressively builds deep GCNs while preserving
their expressiveness. LGT integrates three complementary components: (1)
layer-wise training to stabilize optimization from shallow to deep layers, (2)
low-rank adaptation to fine-tune shallow layers and accelerate training, and
(3) identity initialization to ensure smooth integration of new layers and
accelerate convergence. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
that LGT achieves state-of-the-art performance on vanilla GCN, significantly
improving accuracy even in 32-layer settings. Moreover, as a training method,
LGT can be seamlessly combined with existing methods such as PairNorm and
ContraNorm, further enhancing their performance in deeper networks. LGT offers
a general, architecture-agnostic training framework for scalable deep GCNs. The
code is available at [https://github.com/jfklasdfj/LGT_GCN].

Conclusion: LFR-PINO在计算效率和求解精度之间取得了最佳平衡，适用于通用PDE求解。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural operators have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
solving parametric partial differential equations (PDEs), particularly in the
aerospace field, enabling the learning of solution operators that generalize
across parameter spaces. However, existing methods either suffer from limited
expressiveness due to fixed basis/coefficient designs, or face computational
challenges due to the high dimensionality of the parameter-to-weight mapping
space. We present LFR-PINO, a novel physics-informed neural operator that
introduces two key innovations: (1) a layered hypernetwork architecture that
enables specialized parameter generation for each network layer, and (2) a
frequency-domain reduction strategy that significantly reduces parameter count
while preserving essential spectral features. This design enables efficient
learning of a universal PDE solver through pre-training, capable of directly
handling new equations while allowing optional fine-tuning for enhanced
precision. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through
comprehensive experiments on four representative PDE problems, where LFR-PINO
achieves 22.8%-68.7% error reduction compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
Notably, frequency-domain reduction strategy reduces memory usage by
28.6%-69.3% compared to Hyper-PINNs while maintaining solution accuracy,
striking an optimal balance between computational efficiency and solution
fidelity.

Motivation: 多分布学习在协作学习、公平性和鲁棒性中有广泛应用，但主动多分布学习的研究较少，现有算法的优化性未知。

Method: 开发了新的主动多分布学习算法，并分析了其在可实现和不可实现设置下的标签复杂度。

Result: 在可实现设置中，证明了上界为$\widetilde{O}(\theta_{\max}(d+k)\ln\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$，在不可实现设置中为$\widetilde{O}(\theta_{\max}(d+k)(\ln\frac{1}{\varepsilon}+\frac{\nu^2}{\varepsilon^2})+\frac{k\nu}{\varepsilon^2})$。

Conclusion: 可实现设置中的上界是信息论最优的，而不可实现设置中的$k\nu/\varepsilon^2$项对适当学习者是必要的。

Abstract: Multi-distribution learning extends agnostic Probably Approximately Correct
(PAC) learning to the setting in which a family of $k$ distributions,
$\{D_i\}_{i\in[k]}$, is considered and a classifier's performance is measured
by its error under the worst distribution. This problem has attracted a lot of
recent interests due to its applications in collaborative learning, fairness,
and robustness. Despite a rather complete picture of sample complexity of
passive multi-distribution learning, research on active multi-distribution
learning remains scarce, with algorithms whose optimality remaining unknown.
  In this paper, we develop new algorithms for active multi-distribution
learning and establish improved label complexity upper and lower bounds, in
distribution-dependent and distribution-free settings. Specifically, in the
near-realizable setting we prove an upper bound of
$\widetilde{O}\Bigl(\theta_{\max}(d+k)\ln\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\Bigr)$ and
$\widetilde{O}\Bigl(\theta_{\max}(d+k)\Bigl(\ln\frac{1}{\varepsilon}+\frac{\nu^2}{\varepsilon^2}\Bigr)+\frac{k\nu}{\varepsilon^2}\Bigr)$
in the realizable and agnostic settings respectively, where $\theta_{\max}$ is
the maximum disagreement coefficient among the $k$ distributions, $d$ is the VC
dimension of the hypothesis class, $\nu$ is the multi-distribution error of the
best hypothesis, and $\varepsilon$ is the target excess error. Moreover, we
show that the bound in the realizable setting is information-theoretically
optimal and that the $k\nu/\varepsilon^2$ term in the agnostic setting is
fundamental for proper learners. We also establish instance-dependent sample
complexity bound for passive multidistribution learning that smoothly
interpolates between realizable and agnostic
regimes~\citep{blum2017collaborative,zhang2024optimal}, which may be of
independent interest.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的部署面临设备间通信（collectives）带来的性能开销问题，而传统量化方法难以直接应用于此类通信。

Method: 在XLA编译器中实现了一种动态块级量化AllReduce（EQuARX），结合TPU友好的量化和深度流水线技术。

Result: EQuARX在int8精度下比BF16 AllReduce快1.8倍，并在Gemma 3模型中实现了1.1-1.25倍的加速，且对质量影响极小。

Conclusion: EQuARX为LLM的高效部署提供了一种有效的量化通信解决方案。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have become highly influential, their
enormous scale presents significant deployment challenges. Efficiently serving
these models typically requires distributing them across numerous accelerator
devices, which introduces substantial performance overhead from inter-device
communication (collectives). While model quantization has been widely adopted
to reduce the memory and compute requirements of LLM weights and activations
with minimal quality impact, applying quantization directly to collectives like
AllReduce is inherently difficult due to the inter-device summation involved,
which can lead to numerical instability or significant error accumulation. In
this work, we present a native dynamic block-wise efficient quantized AllReduce
within the XLA compiler for TPUs (EQuARX). By using TPU-friendly quantization
and deep pipelining of communication and compute, EQuARX with int8 precision
achieves a 1.8X speedup over baseline BF16 AllReduce across various network
topologies. Furthermore, EQuARX accelerates the prefill stage of Gemma 3 27B by
1.25X and Gemma 3 12B by 1.1X, respectively, with small to negligible impact on
quality.

learning has been widely used to assess individual risk for chronic diseases.
However, many models rely on medical test data (e.g. blood results, glucose
levels), which limits their utility for proactive self-assessment.
Additionally, to gain public trust, machine learning models should be
explainable and transparent. Although some research on self-assessment machine
learning models includes explainability, their explanations are not validated
against established medical literature, reducing confidence in their
reliability. To address these issues, we develop deep learning models that
predict the risk of developing 13 chronic diseases using only personal and
lifestyle factors, enabling accessible, self-directed preventive care.
Importantly, we use SHAP-based explainability to identify the most influential
model features and validate them against established medical literature. Our
results show a strong alignment between the models' most influential features
and established medical literature, reinforcing the models' trustworthiness.
Critically, we find that this observation holds across 13 distinct diseases,
indicating that this machine learning approach can be broadly trusted for
chronic disease prediction. This work lays the foundation for developing
trustworthy machine learning tools for self-directed preventive care. Future
research can explore other approaches for models' trustworthiness and discuss
how the models can be used ethically and responsibly.

### [309] [Exploiting Efficiency Vulnerabilities in Dynamic Deep Learning Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17621)
*Ravishka Rathnasuriya,Wei Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 动态深度学习系统（DDLSs）因输入自适应计算而优化效率，但其动态特性引入安全风险，如效率攻击。本文研究其安全影响，揭示漏洞，并提出防御措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实环境中深度学习模型部署增加，需满足延迟和资源约束，动态系统应运而生。但其动态性带来未充分研究的安全风险，如效率攻击。

Method: 调查现有攻击策略，识别模型架构和防御机制的不足，研究现代DDLSs的效率攻击可行性，开发针对性防御。

Result: 揭示动态行为的安全隐患，发现当前系统易受效率攻击，防御机制存在局限性。

Conclusion: 需进一步研究动态深度学习系统的安全风险，开发更有效的防御措施以应对效率攻击。

Abstract: The growing deployment of deep learning models in real-world environments has
intensified the need for efficient inference under strict latency and resource
constraints. To meet these demands, dynamic deep learning systems (DDLSs) have
emerged, offering input-adaptive computation to optimize runtime efficiency.
While these systems succeed in reducing cost, their dynamic nature introduces
subtle and underexplored security risks. In particular, input-dependent
execution pathways create opportunities for adversaries to degrade efficiency,
resulting in excessive latency, energy usage, and potential denial-of-service
in time-sensitive deployments. This work investigates the security implications
of dynamic behaviors in DDLSs and reveals how current systems expose efficiency
vulnerabilities exploitable by adversarial inputs. Through a survey of existing
attack strategies, we identify gaps in the coverage of emerging model
architectures and limitations in current defense mechanisms. Building on these
insights, we propose to examine the feasibility of efficiency attacks on modern
DDLSs and develop targeted defenses to preserve robustness under adversarial
conditions.

TL;DR: LLM-Prompt是一个基于大语言模型（LLM）的时间序列预测框架，通过统一文本提示和多模态语义对齐提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的方法在文本提示统一性和模态差异处理上存在不足，限制了其在时间序列预测中的表现。

Method: 提出LLM-Prompt框架，包括统一文本提示范式（软提示和硬提示）、语义空间嵌入和跨模态对齐模块，以及时间序列投影。

Result: 在6个公共数据集和3个碳排放数据集上的实验表明，LLM-Prompt性能优越。

Conclusion: LLM-Prompt通过多提示信息和跨模态对齐，显著提升了时间序列预测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Time series forecasting aims to model temporal dependencies among variables
for future state inference, holding significant importance and widespread
applications in real-world scenarios. Although deep learning-based methods have
achieved remarkable progress, they still exhibit suboptimal performance in
long-term forecasting and data-scarce scenarios. Recent research demonstrates
that large language models (LLMs) achieve promising performance in time series
forecasting. However, we find existing LLM-based methods still have
shortcomings: (1) the absence of a unified paradigm for textual prompt
formulation and (2) the neglect of modality discrepancies between textual
prompts and time series. To address this, we propose LLM-Prompt, an LLM-based
time series forecasting framework integrating multi-prompt information and
cross-modal semantic alignment. Specifically, we first construct a unified
textual prompt paradigm containing learnable soft prompts and textualized hard
prompts. Second, to enhance LLMs' comprehensive understanding of the
forecasting task, we design a semantic space embedding and cross-modal
alignment module to achieve cross-modal fusion of temporal and textual
information. Finally, the transformed time series from the LLMs are projected
to obtain the forecasts. Comprehensive evaluations on 6 public datasets and 3
carbon emission datasets demonstrate that LLM-Prompt is a powerful framework
for time series forecasting.

Conclusion: 上下文多臂老虎机框架为实时、自适应的LLM选择提供了有效解决方案，无需离线微调或数据集特定训练。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit diverse response behaviors, costs, and
strengths, making it challenging to select the most suitable LLM for a given
user query. We study the problem of adaptive multi-LLM selection in an online
setting, where the learner interacts with users through multi-step query
refinement and must choose LLMs sequentially without access to offline datasets
or model internals. A key challenge arises from unstructured context evolution:
the prompt dynamically changes in response to previous model outputs via a
black-box process, which cannot be simulated, modeled, or learned. To address
this, we propose the first contextual bandit framework for sequential LLM
selection under unstructured prompt dynamics. We formalize a notion of myopic
regret and develop a LinUCB-based algorithm that provably achieves sublinear
regret without relying on future context prediction. We further introduce
budget-aware and positionally-aware (favoring early-stage satisfaction)
extensions to accommodate variable query costs and user preferences for early
high-quality responses. Our algorithms are theoretically grounded and require
no offline fine-tuning or dataset-specific training. Experiments on diverse
benchmarks demonstrate that our methods outperform existing LLM routing
strategies in both accuracy and cost-efficiency, validating the power of
contextual bandits for real-time, adaptive LLM selection.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型（如RUM）假设线性关系，无法捕捉非线性交互和个性化偏好，影响了预测准确性。

Result: 在真实数据集上验证，模型能准确预测司机效用，平衡可解释性和不确定性量化。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了预测性能，还能揭示司机的个性化偏好，为系统优化提供工具。

Abstract: In ride-hailing systems, drivers decide whether to accept or reject ride
requests based on factors such as order characteristics, traffic conditions,
and personal preferences. Accurately predicting these decisions is essential
for improving the efficiency and reliability of these systems. Traditional
models, such as the Random Utility Maximization (RUM) approach, typically
predict drivers' decisions by assuming linear correlations among attributes.
However, these models often fall short because they fail to account for
non-linear interactions between attributes and do not cater to the unique,
personalized preferences of individual drivers. In this paper, we develop a
method for learning personalized utility functions using hypernetwork and
ensemble learning. Hypernetworks dynamically generate weights for a linear
utility function based on trip request data and driver profiles, capturing the
non-linear relationships. An ensemble of hypernetworks trained on different
data segments further improve model adaptability and generalization by
introducing controlled randomness, thereby reducing over-fitting. We validate
the performance of our ensemble hypernetworks model in terms of prediction
accuracy and uncertainty estimation in a real-world dataset. The results
demonstrate that our approach not only accurately predicts each driver's
utility but also effectively balances the needs for explainability and
uncertainty quantification. Additionally, our model serves as a powerful tool
for revealing the personalized preferences of different drivers, clearly
illustrating which attributes largely impact their rider acceptance decisions.

TL;DR: FaithfulSAE是一种改进的稀疏自编码器方法，通过使用模型自身生成的合成数据集训练，解决了传统SAE因外部数据集导致的特征不稳定和假特征问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统稀疏自编码器（SAE）在外部数据集上训练时，可能因数据分布不一致导致特征不稳定和假特征问题，影响模型内部特征的可解释性。

Method: 提出FaithfulSAE方法，通过使用模型自身生成的合成数据集进行训练，减少数据分布不一致问题。

Result: 实验表明，FaithfulSAE在多个模型上表现出更高的稳定性，假特征比例更低，且在SAE探测任务中优于基于网络数据集的SAE。

Conclusion: FaithfulSAE通过消除对外部数据集的依赖，提升了模型内部特征的捕捉能力，强调了SAE训练数据集的重要性。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising solution for
decomposing large language model representations into interpretable features.
However, Paulo and Belrose (2025) have highlighted instability across different
initialization seeds, and Heap et al. (2025) have pointed out that SAEs may not
capture model-internal features. These problems likely stem from training SAEs
on external datasets - either collected from the Web or generated by another
model - which may contain out-of-distribution (OOD) data beyond the model's
generalisation capabilities. This can result in hallucinated SAE features,
which we term "Fake Features", that misrepresent the model's internal
activations. To address these issues, we propose FaithfulSAE, a method that
trains SAEs on the model's own synthetic dataset. Using FaithfulSAEs, we
demonstrate that training SAEs on less-OOD instruction datasets results in SAEs
being more stable across seeds. Notably, FaithfulSAEs outperform SAEs trained
on web-based datasets in the SAE probing task and exhibit a lower Fake Feature
Ratio in 5 out of 7 models. Overall, our approach eliminates the dependency on
external datasets, advancing interpretability by better capturing
model-internal features while highlighting the often neglected importance of
SAE training datasets.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了GNNs对MEAs的易受性，同时展示了高效、伦理的模型获取方法在低资源研究环境中的潜力。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable utility across
diverse applications, and their growing complexity has made Machine Learning as
a Service (MLaaS) a viable platform for scalable deployment. However, this
accessibility also exposes GNN to serious security threats, most notably model
extraction attacks (MEAs), in which adversaries strategically query a deployed
model to construct a high-fidelity replica. In this work, we evaluate the
vulnerability of GNNs to MEAs and explore their potential for cost-effective
model acquisition in non-adversarial research settings. Importantly, adaptive
node querying strategies can also serve a critical role in research,
particularly when labeling data is expensive or time-consuming. By selectively
sampling informative nodes, researchers can train high-performing GNNs with
minimal supervision, which is particularly valuable in domains such as
biomedicine, where annotations often require expert input. To address this, we
propose a node querying strategy tailored to a highly practical yet
underexplored scenario, where bulk queries are prohibited, and only a limited
set of initial nodes is available. Our approach iteratively refines the node
selection mechanism over multiple learning cycles, leveraging historical
feedback to improve extraction efficiency. Extensive experiments on benchmark
graph datasets demonstrate our superiority over comparable baselines on
accuracy, fidelity, and F1 score under strict query-size constraints. These
results highlight both the susceptibility of deployed GNNs to extraction
attacks and the promise of ethical, efficient GNN acquisition methods to
support low-resource research environments.

Motivation: 现实世界中数据分布持续变化，现有方法可能因虚假相关性而泛化能力不足，需要捕捉动态因果因素和机制漂移。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，SYNC表现出优越的时间泛化性能。

Conclusion: SYNC能有效学习动态因果表示，提升模型在动态场景中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Endowing deep models with the ability to generalize in dynamic scenarios is
of vital significance for real-world deployment, given the continuous and
complex changes in data distribution. Recently, evolving domain generalization
(EDG) has emerged to address distribution shifts over time, aiming to capture
evolving patterns for improved model generalization. However, existing EDG
methods may suffer from spurious correlations by modeling only the dependence
between data and targets across domains, creating a shortcut between
task-irrelevant factors and the target, which hinders generalization. To this
end, we design a time-aware structural causal model (SCM) that incorporates
dynamic causal factors and the causal mechanism drifts, and propose
\textbf{S}tatic-D\textbf{YN}amic \textbf{C}ausal Representation Learning
(\textbf{SYNC}), an approach that effectively learns time-aware causal
representations. Specifically, it integrates specially designed
information-theoretic objectives into a sequential VAE framework which captures
evolving patterns, and produces the desired representations by preserving
intra-class compactness of causal factors both across and within domains.
Moreover, we theoretically show that our method can yield the optimal causal
predictor for each time domain. Results on both synthetic and real-world
datasets exhibit that SYNC can achieve superior temporal generalization
performance.

Abstract: Retired electric vehicle batteries offer immense potential to support
low-carbon energy systems, but uncertainties in their degradation behavior and
data inaccessibilities under second-life use pose major barriers to safe and
scalable deployment. This work proposes a Physics-Informed Mixture of Experts
(PIMOE) network that computes battery degradation trajectories using partial,
field-accessible signals in a single cycle. PIMOE leverages an adaptive
multi-degradation prediction module to classify degradation modes using expert
weight synthesis underpinned by capacity-voltage and relaxation data, producing
latent degradation trend embeddings. These are input to a use-dependent
recurrent network for long-term trajectory prediction. Validated on 207
batteries across 77 use conditions and 67,902 cycles, PIMOE achieves an average
mean absolute percentage (MAPE) errors of 0.88% with a 0.43 ms inference time.
Compared to the state-of-the-art Informer and PatchTST, it reduces
computational time and MAPE by 50%, respectively. Compatible with random state
of charge region sampling, PIMOE supports 150-cycle forecasts with 1.50%
average and 6.26% maximum MAPE, and operates effectively even with pruned 5MB
training data. Broadly, PIMOE framework offers a deployable, history-free
solution for battery degradation trajectory computation, redefining how
second-life energy storage systems are assessed, optimized, and integrated into
the sustainable energy landscape.

Abstract: Motivated by the limitations of current spectral analysis methods-such as
reliance on single-modality data, limited generalizability, and poor
interpretability-we propose a novel multi-modal spectral analysis framework
that integrates prior knowledge graphs with Large Language Models. Our method
explicitly bridges physical spectral measurements and chemical structural
semantics by representing them in a unified Textual Graph format, enabling
flexible, interpretable, and generalizable spectral understanding. Raw spectra
are first transformed into TAGs, where nodes and edges are enriched with
textual attributes describing both spectral properties and chemical context.
These are then merged with relevant prior knowledge-including functional groups
and molecular graphs-to form a Task Graph that incorporates "Prompt Nodes"
supporting LLM-based contextual reasoning. A Graph Neural Network further
processes this structure to complete downstream tasks. This unified design
enables seamless multi-modal integration and automated feature decoding with
minimal manual annotation. Our framework achieves consistently high performance
across multiple spectral analysis tasks, including node-level, edge-level, and
graph-level classification. It demonstrates robust generalization in both
zero-shot and few-shot settings, highlighting its effectiveness in learning
from limited data and supporting in-context reasoning. This work establishes a
scalable and interpretable foundation for LLM-driven spectral analysis,
unifying physical and chemical modalities for scientific applications.

Conclusion: 生物启发的乘法动力学可能为未来高效能硬件上的稳定低精度推理和学习提供新思路。

Abstract: Studies in neuroscience have shown that biological synapses follow a
log-normal distribution whose transitioning can be explained by noisy
multiplicative dynamics. Biological networks can function stably even under
dynamically fluctuating conditions arising due to unreliable synaptic
transmissions. Here we ask: Is it possible to design similar multiplicative
training in artificial neural networks? To answer this question, we derive a
Bayesian learning rule that assumes log-normal posterior distributions over
weights which gives rise to a new Log-Normal Multiplicative Dynamics (LMD)
algorithm. The algorithm uses multiplicative updates with both noise and
regularization applied multiplicatively. The method is as easy to implement as
Adam and only requires one additional vector to store. Our results show that
LMD achieves stable and accurate training-from-scratch under low-precision
forward operations for Vision Transformer and GPT-2. These results suggest that
multiplicative dynamics, a biological feature, may enable stable low-precision
inference and learning on future energy-efficient hardware.

Conclusion: PhysiX成功解决了数据瓶颈，证明了跨任务联合训练的协同学习效果。

Abstract: Foundation models have achieved remarkable success across video, image, and
language domains. By scaling up the number of parameters and training datasets,
these models acquire generalizable world knowledge and often surpass
task-specific approaches. However, such progress has yet to extend to the
domain of physics simulation. A primary bottleneck is data scarcity: while
millions of images, videos, and textual resources are readily available on the
internet, the largest physics simulation datasets contain only tens of
thousands of samples. This data limitation hinders the use of large models, as
overfitting becomes a major concern. As a result, physics applications
typically rely on small models, which struggle with long-range prediction due
to limited context understanding. Additionally, unlike images, videos, or
text-which typically exhibit fixed granularity-physics datasets often vary
drastically in scale, amplifying the challenges of scaling up multitask
training. We introduce PhysiX, the first large-scale foundation model for
physics simulation. PhysiX is a 4.5B parameter autoregressive generative model.
It uses a discrete tokenizer to encode physical processes at different scales
into a sequence of discrete tokens, and employs an autoregressive next-token
prediction objective to model such processes in the token space. To mitigate
the rounding error in the discretization process, PhysiX incorporates a
specialized refinement module. Through extensive experiments, we show that
PhysiX effectively addresses the data bottleneck, outperforming task-specific
baselines under comparable settings as well as the previous absolute
state-of-the-art approaches on The Well benchmark. Our results indicate that
knowledge learned from natural videos can be successfully transferred to
physics simulation, and that joint training across diverse simulation tasks
enables synergistic learning.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Machine Learning (ML) have yielded powerful models
capable of extracting structured information from diverse and complex data
sources. However, a significant challenge lies in translating these perceptual
or extractive outputs into actionable, reasoned decisions within complex
operational workflows. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a
novel approach that integrates the outputs from various machine learning models
directly with the PyReason framework, an open-world temporal logic programming
reasoning engine. PyReason's foundation in generalized annotated logic allows
for the seamless incorporation of real-valued outputs (e.g., probabilities,
confidence scores) from diverse ML models, treating them as truth intervals
within its logical framework. Crucially, PyReason provides mechanisms,
implemented in Python, to continuously poll ML model outputs, convert them into
logical facts, and dynamically recompute the minimal model, ensuring real-tine
adaptive decision-making. Furthermore, its native support for temporal
reasoning, knowledge graph integration, and fully explainable interface traces
enables sophisticated analysis over time-sensitive process data and existing
organizational knowledge. By combining the strengths of perception and
extraction from ML models with the logical deduction and transparency of
PyReason, we aim to create a powerful system for automating complex processes.
This integration finds utility across numerous domains, including
manufacturing, healthcare, and business operations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指令调节方法在低容量模型中存在表示限制，限制了嵌入专业化的性能提升。

Method: 引入Mixture of Task Experts (MoTE) Transformer块，结合任务感知对比学习（TACL）训练任务专用参数。

Result: MoTE在检索数据集上性能提升64%（+3.27→+5.21），在所有数据集上提升43%（+1.81→+2.60）。

Conclusion: MoTE在不改变指令、训练数据、推理时间或参数数量的情况下显著提升了嵌入专业化性能。

Abstract: Dense embeddings are fundamental to modern machine learning systems, powering
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), information retrieval, and representation
learning. While instruction-conditioning has become the dominant approach for
embedding specialization, its direct application to low-capacity models imposes
fundamental representational constraints that limit the performance gains
derived from specialization. In this paper, we analyze these limitations and
introduce the Mixture of Task Experts (MoTE) transformer block, which leverages
task-specialized parameters trained with Task-Aware Contrastive Learning
(\tacl) to enhance the model ability to generate specialized embeddings.
Empirical results show that MoTE achieves $64\%$ higher performance gains in
retrieval datasets ($+3.27 \rightarrow +5.21$) and $43\%$ higher performance
gains across all datasets ($+1.81 \rightarrow +2.60$). Critically, these gains
are achieved without altering instructions, training data, inference time, or
number of active parameters.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SING的自然梯度变分推断方法，用于高效推断潜在SDE模型中的状态路径，解决了现有方法的收敛慢和数值不稳定问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 潜在SDE模型在复杂领域中应用广泛，但精确的后验推断通常难以实现，现有变分推断方法存在收敛慢和不稳定的问题。

Method: 利用自然梯度变分推断（SING）方法，通过近似难解积分和并行化时间计算，高效利用模型和变分后验的几何结构。

Result: SING在状态推断和漂移函数估计上优于现有方法，并在多个数据集上验证了其有效性，包括自由行为动物神经动力学建模。

Conclusion: SING为复杂动力学系统中的准确推断提供了有力工具，特别适用于先验知识有限和非共轭结构的场景。

Abstract: Latent stochastic differential equation (SDE) models are important tools for
the unsupervised discovery of dynamical systems from data, with applications
ranging from engineering to neuroscience. In these complex domains, exact
posterior inference of the latent state path is typically intractable,
motivating the use of approximate methods such as variational inference (VI).
However, existing VI methods for inference in latent SDEs often suffer from
slow convergence and numerical instability. Here, we propose SDE Inference via
Natural Gradients (SING), a method that leverages natural gradient VI to
efficiently exploit the underlying geometry of the model and variational
posterior. SING enables fast and reliable inference in latent SDE models by
approximating intractable integrals and parallelizing computations in time. We
provide theoretical guarantees that SING will approximately optimize the
intractable, continuous-time objective of interest. Moreover, we demonstrate
that better state inference enables more accurate estimation of nonlinear drift
functions using, for example, Gaussian process SDE models. SING outperforms
prior methods in state inference and drift estimation on a variety of datasets,
including a challenging application to modeling neural dynamics in freely
behaving animals. Altogether, our results illustrate the potential of SING as a
tool for accurate inference in complex dynamical systems, especially those
characterized by limited prior knowledge and non-conjugate structure.

Motivation: 传统神经网络适应新任务需要任务特定的微调，耗时且依赖标注数据。本文探索一种生成方法，直接从任务标识生成参数，避免微调。

Method: 使用扩散模型学习任务特定参数空间的结构，并根据任务标识生成参数。评估了单任务、多任务和未知任务的参数生成能力。

Result: 扩散模型能生成准确的任务特定参数，支持多任务插值，但在未知任务上泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 生成方法在已知任务上潜力显著，但对未知任务的泛化仍需改进。

Abstract: Adapting neural networks to new tasks typically requires task-specific
fine-tuning, which is time-consuming and reliant on labeled data. We explore a
generative alternative that produces task-specific parameters directly from
task identity, eliminating the need for task-specific training. To this end, we
propose using diffusion models to learn the underlying structure of effective
task-specific parameter space and synthesize parameters on demand. Once
trained, the task-conditioned diffusion model can generate specialized weights
directly from task identifiers. We evaluate this approach across three
scenarios: generating parameters for a single seen task, for multiple seen
tasks, and for entirely unseen tasks. Experiments show that diffusion models
can generate accurate task-specific parameters and support multi-task
interpolation when parameter subspaces are well-structured, but fail to
generalize to unseen tasks, highlighting both the potential and limitations of
this generative solution.

Result: 实验表明，该方法比基线方法更稳健地估计泛化差距。

Conclusion: 提出的平坦性度量方法能有效评估深度网络的泛化能力，尤其在非校准模型中仍保持可靠性。

Abstract: Recent literature has examined the relationship between the curvature of the
loss function at minima and generalization, mainly in the context of
overparameterized networks. A key observation is that "flat" minima tend to
generalize better than "sharp" minima. While this idea is supported by
empirical evidence, it has also been shown that deep networks can generalize
even with arbitrary sharpness, as measured by either the trace or the spectral
norm of the Hessian. In this paper, we argue that generalization could be
assessed by measuring flatness using a soft rank measure of the Hessian. We
show that when the common neural network model (neural network with exponential
family negative log likelihood loss) is calibrated, and its prediction error
and its confidence in the prediction are not correlated with the first and the
second derivatives of the network's output, our measure accurately captures the
asymptotic expected generalization gap. For non-calibrated models, we connect
our flatness measure to the well-known Takeuchi Information Criterion and show
that it still provides reliable estimates of generalization gaps for models
that are not overly confident. Experimental results indicate that our approach
offers a robust estimate of the generalization gap compared to baselines.

TL;DR: HGCNet提出了一种基于超图的因果框架，用于研究批大小如何通过梯度噪声、极小值锐度和模型复杂性影响泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 批大小对泛化能力的影响在视觉任务中已有研究，但在图和文本领域中的因果机制尚未深入探索。

Method: HGCNet利用深度结构因果模型（DSCMs）和超图捕捉训练动态中的高阶交互，并通过do-calculus量化批大小干预的直接和间接效应。

Result: 实验表明，HGCNet在多个数据集上优于基线模型，并揭示较小批大小通过增加随机性和平坦极小值提升泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该研究将可解释性作为驱动架构和优化选择的工具，而不仅仅是事后分析。

Abstract: While the impact of batch size on generalisation is well studied in vision
tasks, its causal mechanisms remain underexplored in graph and text domains. We
introduce a hypergraph-based causal framework, HGCNet, that leverages deep
structural causal models (DSCMs) to uncover how batch size influences
generalisation via gradient noise, minima sharpness, and model complexity.
Unlike prior approaches based on static pairwise dependencies, HGCNet employs
hypergraphs to capture higher-order interactions across training dynamics.
Using do-calculus, we quantify direct and mediated effects of batch size
interventions, providing interpretable, causally grounded insights into
optimisation. Experiments on citation networks, biomedical text, and e-commerce
reviews show that HGCNet outperforms strong baselines including GCN, GAT,
PI-GNN, BERT, and RoBERTa. Our analysis reveals that smaller batch sizes
causally enhance generalisation through increased stochasticity and flatter
minima, offering actionable interpretability to guide training strategies in
deep learning. This work positions interpretability as a driver of principled
architectural and optimisation choices beyond post hoc analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如RLHF和DPO需要直接优化模型参数，无法在测试时使用或适用于模型权重不可访问的情况，而测试时方法则因高推理成本和基于不完美奖励函数导致输出次优。

Method: IRO通过迭代采样、重采样和训练轻量级价值函数来对齐冻结的基础模型，测试时通过搜索优化过程指导生成。

Result: IRO允许用户在不访问模型权重的情况下对齐模型，类似于OpenAI的RFT。

Conclusion: IRO提供了一种无需修改模型参数的灵活对齐方法，适用于模型权重不可访问的场景。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences usually requires
fine-tuning methods such as RLHF and DPO. These methods directly optimize the
model parameters, so they cannot be used in test-time to improve model
performance, nor are they applicable when the model weights are not accessible.
In contrast, test-time methods sidestep weight updates by leveraging reward
functions to guide and improve output quality. However, they incur high
inference costs, and their one-shot guidance is often based on imperfect reward
or value functions, leading to suboptimal outputs. In this work, we present a
method named Iterative Reweight-then-Optimize (IRO), a reinforcement learning
(RL) framework that performs RL-style alignment of the (frozen) base model
without touching its parameters. During training, each iteration (i) samples
candidates from the base model, (ii) resamples using current value functions,
and (iii) trains a new lightweight value function that guides the next decoding
pass. At test time, the value functions are used to guide the base model
generation via a search-based optimization process. Notably, users can apply
IRO to align a model on their own dataset, similar to OpenAI's reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT), but without requiring access to the model weights.

Conclusion: 提出了一种统一的因果几何方法，适用于动态社交环境中的不确定性学习。

Abstract: Human social behaviour is governed by complex interactions shaped by
uncertainty, causality, and group dynamics. We propose Causal Spherical
Hypergraph Networks (Causal-SphHN), a principled framework for socially
grounded prediction that jointly models higher-order structure, directional
influence, and epistemic uncertainty. Our method represents individuals as
hyperspherical embeddings and group contexts as hyperedges, capturing semantic
and relational geometry. Uncertainty is quantified via Shannon entropy over von
Mises-Fisher distributions, while temporal causal dependencies are identified
using Granger-informed subgraphs. Information is propagated through an angular
message-passing mechanism that respects belief dispersion and directional
semantics. Experiments on SNARE (offline networks), PHEME (online discourse),
and AMIGOS (multimodal affect) show that Causal-SphHN improves predictive
accuracy, robustness, and calibration over strong baselines. Moreover, it
enables interpretable analysis of influence patterns and social ambiguity. This
work contributes a unified causal-geometric approach for learning under
uncertainty in dynamic social environments.

Conclusion: 合成数据生成器在低数据量下表现良好，SDV库因其易用性更适合实际应用。

Abstract: High-quality training data is critical to the performance of machine learning
models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs). However, obtaining real,
high-quality data can be challenging, especially for smaller organizations and
early-stage startups. Synthetic data generators provide a promising solution by
replicating the statistical and structural properties of real data while
preserving privacy and scalability. This study evaluates the performance of six
tabular synthetic data generators from two widely used open-source libraries:
SDV (Gaussian Copula, CTGAN, TVAE) and Synthicity (Bayesian Network, CTGAN,
TVAE). Using a real-world dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository,
comprising energy consumption and environmental variables from Belgium, we
simulate a low-data regime by training models on only 1,000 rows. Each
generator is then tasked with producing synthetic datasets under two
conditions: a 1:1 (1,000 rows) and a 1:10 (10,000 rows) input-output ratio.
Evaluation is conducted using two criteria: statistical similarity, measured
via classical statistics and distributional metrics; and predictive utility,
assessed using a "Train on Synthetic, Test on Real" approach with four
regression models. While statistical similarity remained consistent across
models in both scenarios, predictive utility declined notably in the 1:10 case.
The Bayesian Network from Synthicity achieved the highest fidelity in both
scenarios, while TVAE from SDV performed best in predictive tasks under the
1:10 setting. Although no significant performance gap was found between the two
libraries, SDV stands out for its superior documentation and ease of use,
making it more accessible for practitioners.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Continual learning systems face the dual challenge of preventing catastrophic
forgetting while maintaining energy efficiency, particularly in
resource-constrained environments. This paper introduces Pathway-based
Progressive Inference (PaPI), a novel theoretical framework that addresses
these challenges through a mathematically rigorous approach to pathway
selection and adaptation. We formulate continual learning as an
energy-constrained optimization problem and provide formal convergence
guarantees for our pathway routing mechanisms. Our theoretical analysis
demonstrates that PaPI achieves an $\mathcal{O}(K)$ improvement in the
stability-plasticity trade-off compared to monolithic architectures, where $K$
is the number of pathways. We derive tight bounds on forgetting rates using
Fisher Information Matrix analysis and prove that PaPI's energy consumption
scales with the number of active parameters rather than the total model size.
Comparative theoretical analysis shows that PaPI provides stronger guarantees
against catastrophic forgetting than Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) while
maintaining better energy efficiency than both EWC and Gradient Episodic Memory
(GEM). Our experimental validation confirms these theoretical advantages across
multiple benchmarks, demonstrating PaPI's effectiveness for continual learning
in energy-constrained settings. Our codes are available at

Conclusion: 研究为ICL提供了基于策略损失与复杂性权衡的解释性和预测性理论。

Abstract: Recent work analyzing in-context learning (ICL) has identified a broad set of
strategies that describe model behavior in different experimental conditions.
We aim to unify these findings by asking why a model learns these disparate
strategies in the first place. Specifically, we start with the observation that
when trained to learn a mixture of tasks, as is popular in the literature, the
strategies learned by a model for performing ICL can be captured by a family of
Bayesian predictors: a memorizing predictor, which assumes a discrete prior on
the set of seen tasks, and a generalizing predictor, wherein the prior matches
the underlying task distribution. Adopting the lens of rational analysis from
cognitive science, where a learner's behavior is explained as an optimal
adaptation to data given computational constraints, we develop a hierarchical
Bayesian framework that almost perfectly predicts Transformer next token
predictions throughout training without assuming access to its weights. Under
this framework, pretraining is viewed as a process of updating the posterior
probability of different strategies, and its inference-time behavior as a
posterior-weighted average over these strategies' predictions. Our framework
draws on common assumptions about neural network learning dynamics, which make
explicit a tradeoff between loss and complexity among candidate strategies:
beyond how well it explains the data, a model's preference towards implementing
a strategy is dictated by its complexity. This helps explain well-known ICL
phenomena, while offering novel predictions: e.g., we show a superlinear trend
in the timescale for transition to memorization as task diversity is increased.
Overall, our work advances an explanatory and predictive account of ICL
grounded in tradeoffs between strategy loss and complexity.

Motivation: 现有动态/混合精度量化方法需要重新训练或特殊硬件，而后训练量化（PTQ）方法无法适应动态资源需求且存储开销大。

Method: 通过整数权重分解和嵌套机制，将量化权重拆分为高低位权重，优化高位权重并嵌套到原始量化权重中。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K预训练DNN上，NestQuant模型在准确率和资源开销方面表现优异，例如ResNet-101 INT8嵌套INT6的准确率分别为78.1%和77.9%，切换开销减少约78.1%。

Conclusion: NestQuant是一种高效的量化方法，适用于物联网设备，能够动态适应资源需求并显著减少存储和切换开销。

Abstract: Deploying quantized deep neural network (DNN) models with resource adaptation
capabilities on ubiquitous Internet of Things (IoT) devices to provide
high-quality AI services can leverage the benefits of compression and meet
multi-scenario resource requirements. However, existing dynamic/mixed precision
quantization requires retraining or special hardware, whereas post-training
quantization (PTQ) has two limitations for resource adaptation: (i) The
state-of-the-art PTQ methods only provide one fixed bitwidth model, which makes
it challenging to adapt to the dynamic resources of IoT devices; (ii) Deploying
multiple PTQ models with diverse bitwidths consumes large storage resources and
switching overheads. To this end, this paper introduces a resource-friendly
post-training integer-nesting quantization, i.e., NestQuant, for on-device
quantized model switching on IoT devices. The proposed NestQuant incorporates
the integer weight decomposition, which bit-wise splits quantized weights into
higher-bit and lower-bit weights of integer data types. It also contains a
decomposed weights nesting mechanism to optimize the higher-bit weights by
adaptive rounding and nest them into the original quantized weights. In
deployment, we can send and store only one NestQuant model and switch between
the full-bit/part-bit model by paging in/out lower-bit weights to adapt to
resource changes and reduce consumption. Experimental results on the
ImageNet-1K pretrained DNNs demonstrated that the NestQuant model can achieve
high performance in top-1 accuracy, and reduce in terms of data transmission,
storage consumption, and switching overheads. In particular, the ResNet-101
with INT8 nesting INT6 can achieve 78.1% and 77.9% accuracy for full-bit and
part-bit models, respectively, and reduce switching overheads by approximately
78.1% compared with diverse bitwidths PTQ models.

Conclusion: FedNAM+是一个高效、可解释且鲁棒的框架，适用于联邦学习场景，增强了预测建模的信任和透明度。

Abstract: Federated learning has significantly advanced distributed training of machine
learning models across decentralized data sources. However, existing frameworks
often lack comprehensive solutions that combine uncertainty quantification,
interpretability, and robustness. To address this, we propose FedNAM+, a
federated learning framework that integrates Neural Additive Models (NAMs) with
a novel conformal prediction method to enable interpretable and reliable
uncertainty estimation. Our method introduces a dynamic level adjustment
technique that utilizes gradient-based sensitivity maps to identify key input
features influencing predictions. This facilitates both interpretability and
pixel-wise uncertainty estimates. Unlike traditional interpretability methods
such as LIME and SHAP, which do not provide confidence intervals, FedNAM+
offers visual insights into prediction reliability. We validate our approach
through experiments on CT scan, MNIST, and CIFAR datasets, demonstrating high
prediction accuracy with minimal loss (e.g., only 0.1% on MNIST), along with
transparent uncertainty measures. Visual analysis highlights variable
uncertainty intervals, revealing low-confidence regions where model performance
can be improved with additional data. Compared to Monte Carlo Dropout, FedNAM+
delivers efficient and global uncertainty estimates with reduced computational
overhead, making it particularly suitable for federated learning scenarios.
Overall, FedNAM+ provides a robust, interpretable, and computationally
efficient framework that enhances trust and transparency in decentralized
predictive modeling.

Conclusion: 在参数假设下，间接引出目标属性的最佳策略是通过合理选择权重，尤其是将某些权重设为零，以提高估计准确性。

Abstract: People are commonly interested in predicting a statistical property of a
random event such as mean and variance. Proper scoring rules assess the quality
of predictions and require that the expected score gets uniquely maximized at
the precise prediction, in which case we call the score directly elicits the
property. Previous research work has widely studied the existence and the
characterization of proper scoring rules for different properties, but little
literature discusses the choice of proper scoring rules for applications at
hand. In this paper, we explore a novel task, the indirect elicitation of
properties with parametric assumptions, where the target property is a function
of several directly-elicitable sub-properties and the total score is a weighted
sum of proper scoring rules for each sub-property. Because of the restriction
to a parametric model class, different settings for the weights lead to
different constrained optimal solutions. Our goal is to figure out how the
choice of weights affects the estimation of the target property and which
choice is the best. We start it with simulation studies and observe an
interesting pattern: in most cases, the optimal estimation of the target
property changes monotonically with the increase of each weight, and the best
configuration of weights is often to set some weights as zero. To understand
how it happens, we first establish the elementary theoretical framework and
then provide deeper sufficient conditions for the case of two sub-properties
and of more sub-properties respectively. The theory on 2-D cases perfectly
interprets the experimental results. In higher-dimensional situations, we
especially study the linear cases and suggest that more complex settings can be
understood with locally mapping into linear situations or using linear
approximations when the true values of sub-properties are close enough to the
parametric space.

Abstract: Chip manufacturing is a complex process, and to achieve a faster time to
market, an increasing number of untrusted third-party tools and designs from
around the world are being utilized. The use of these untrusted third party
intellectual properties (IPs) and tools increases the risk of adversaries
inserting hardware trojans (HTs). The covert nature of HTs poses significant
threats to cyberspace, potentially leading to severe consequences for national
security, the economy, and personal privacy. Many graph neural network
(GNN)-based HT detection methods have been proposed. However, they perform
poorly on larger designs because they rely on training with smaller designs.
Additionally, these methods do not explore different GNN models that are
well-suited for HT detection or provide efficient training and inference
processes. We propose a novel framework that generates graph embeddings for
large designs (e.g., RISC-V) and incorporates various GNN models tailored for
HT detection. Furthermore, our framework introduces domain-specific techniques
for efficient training and inference by implementing model quantization. Model
quantization reduces the precision of the weights, lowering the computational
requirements, enhancing processing speed without significantly affecting
detection accuracy. We evaluate our framework using a custom dataset, and our
results demonstrate a precision of 98.66% and a recall (true positive rate) of
92.30%, highlighting the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach in
detecting hardware trojans in large-scale chip designs

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for auto-bidding has shifted from using
simplistic offline simulators (Simulation-based RL Bidding, SRLB) to offline RL
on fixed real datasets (Offline RL Bidding, ORLB). However, ORLB policies are
limited by the dataset's state space coverage, offering modest gains. While
SRLB expands state coverage, its simulator-reality gap risks misleading
policies. This paper introduces Model-based RL Bidding (MRLB), which learns an
environment model from real data to bridge this gap. MRLB trains policies using
both real and model-generated data, expanding state coverage beyond ORLB. To
ensure model reliability, we propose: 1) A permutation equivariant model
architecture for better generalization, and 2) A robust offline Q-learning
method that pessimistically penalizes model errors. These form the Permutation
Equivariant Model-based Offline RL (PE-MORL) algorithm. Real-world experiments
show that PE-MORL outperforms state-of-the-art auto-bidding methods.

*Shulun Chen,Wei Shao,Flora D. Salim,Hao Xue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ASTER模型将时空预测与决策支持结合，通过RaST模块和Poda代理提升资源分配效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时空预测与决策阶段脱节，导致下游效率低下，尤其在紧急响应中资源分配更为关键。

Method: 提出ASTER框架，包含RaST模块捕获动态资源条件下的时空依赖，以及Poda代理通过多目标强化学习生成决策策略。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，ASTER在早期预测准确性和资源分配效果上均表现最优。

Conclusion: ASTER通过直接支持决策，显著提升了时空预测的实际应用效果。

Abstract: Supporting decision-making has long been a central vision in the field of
spatio-temporal intelligence. While prior work has improved the timeliness and
accuracy of spatio-temporal forecasting, converting these forecasts into
actionable strategies remains a key challenge. A main limitation is the
decoupling of the prediction and the downstream decision phases, which can
significantly degrade the downstream efficiency. For example, in emergency
response, the priority is successful resource allocation and intervention, not
just incident prediction. To this end, it is essential to propose an Adaptive
Spatio-Temporal Early Decision model (ASTER) that reforms the forecasting
paradigm from event anticipation to actionable decision support. This framework
ensures that information is directly used for decision-making, thereby
maximizing overall effectiveness. Specifically, ASTER introduces a new
Resource-aware Spatio-Temporal interaction module (RaST) that adaptively
captures long- and short-term dependencies under dynamic resource conditions,
producing context-aware spatiotemporal representations. To directly generate
actionable decisions, we further design a Preference-oriented decision agent
(Poda) based on multi-objective reinforcement learning, which transforms
predictive signals into resource-efficient intervention strategies by deriving
optimal actions under specific preferences and dynamic constraints.
Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the
state-of-the-art performance of ASTER in improving both early prediction
accuracy and resource allocation outcomes across six downstream metrics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于非平衡熵优化的新型数学框架，用于重构玻尔兹曼机，显著降低了成本和资源需求，同时提供了性能优越的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型成本高昂且过度自信，需要一种更高效且可靠的学习框架。

Method: 基于总概率定律的非平衡熵优化数学框架，无需梯度下降，具有数学证明的存在性和唯一性标准。

Result: 在合成问题和历史气候数据上表现优异，模型更简洁且性能更高，预测能力优于现有工具。

Conclusion: 该框架为AI模型提供了一种高效、低成本且可靠的替代方案，特别适用于复杂问题。

Abstract: Progress of AI has led to a creation of very successful, but by no means
humble models and tools, especially regarding (i) the huge and further
exploding costs and resources they demand, and (ii) the over-confidence of
these tools with the answers they provide. Here we introduce a novel
mathematical framework for a non-equilibrium entropy-optimizing reformulation
of Boltzmann machines based on the exact law of total probability. It results
in the highly-performant, but much cheaper, gradient-descent-free learning
framework with mathematically-justified existence and uniqueness criteria, and
answer confidence/reliability measures. Comparisons to state-of-the-art AI
tools in terms of performance, cost and the model descriptor lengths on a set
of synthetic problems with varying complexity reveal that the proposed method
results in more performant and slim models, with the descriptor lengths being
very close to the intrinsic complexity scaling bounds for the underlying
problems. Applying this framework to historical climate data results in models
with systematically higher prediction skills for the onsets of La Ni\~na and El
Ni\~no climate phenomena, requiring just few years of climate data for training
- a small fraction of what is necessary for contemporary climate prediction
tools.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的评估方法UNIVERSE，用于细粒度、时间敏感的世界模型评估，解决了现有评估指标的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法无法捕捉世界模型在动作对齐和语义一致性方面的细粒度表现，需要一种更有效的评估工具。

Method: 提出UNIVERSE方法，通过调整VLM以适应数据与计算限制下的评估任务，支持动作识别和角色识别的多种评估格式。

Result: UNIVERSE在单一检查点下达到了与任务专用基线相当的性能，并通过人类研究验证了其与人类判断的高度一致性。

Conclusion: UNIVERSE是一种可扩展、语义感知的世界模型评估工具，适用于复杂环境下的动态评估。

Abstract: World models -- generative models that simulate environment dynamics
conditioned on past observations and actions -- are gaining prominence in
planning, simulation, and embodied AI. However, evaluating their rollouts
remains a fundamental challenge, requiring fine-grained, temporally grounded
assessment of action alignment and semantic consistency -- capabilities not
captured by existing metrics. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise
as automatic evaluators of generative content due to their strong multimodal
reasoning abilities. Yet, their use in fine-grained, temporally sensitive
evaluation tasks remains limited and requires targeted adaptation. We introduce
a evaluation protocol targeting two recognition tasks -- action recognition and
character recognition -- each assessed across binary, multiple-choice, and
open-ended formats. To support this, we present UNIVERSE (UNIfied
Vision-language Evaluator for Rollouts in Simulated Environments), a method for
adapting VLMs to rollout evaluation under data and compute constraints. We
conduct a large-scale study comparing full, partial, and parameter-efficient
finetuning across task formats, context lengths, sampling strategies, and data
compositions. The resulting unified evaluator matches the performance of
task-specific baselines using a single checkpoint. Human studies confirm strong
alignment with human judgments, establishing UNIVERSE as a scalable,
semantics-aware evaluator for world models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为h-calibration的概率学习框架，用于解决深度神经网络输出概率的校准问题，克服了现有方法的十大局限性，并在实验中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在许多学习任务中表现优异，但其输出的概率往往存在校准问题，导致不可靠的概率输出。因此，研究如何在不牺牲分类性能的情况下校准预训练模型的概率输出具有重要意义。

Method: 本文总结了现有校准方法的三类策略，并提出了一种基于概率学习的h-calibration框架，设计了一种简单有效的后校准算法。

Result: 实验验证表明，该方法不仅克服了现有方法的局限性，还在性能上显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: h-calibration框架为学习误差有界的校准概率提供了理论支持，并在标准基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，为相关领域提供了有价值的参考。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable performance across numerous
learning tasks but often suffer from miscalibration, resulting in unreliable
probability outputs. This has inspired many recent works on mitigating
miscalibration, particularly through post-hoc recalibration methods that aim to
obtain calibrated probabilities without sacrificing the classification
performance of pre-trained models. In this study, we summarize and categorize
previous works into three general strategies: intuitively designed methods,
binning-based methods, and methods based on formulations of ideal calibration.
Through theoretical and practical analysis, we highlight ten common limitations
in previous approaches. To address these limitations, we propose a
probabilistic learning framework for calibration called h-calibration, which
theoretically constructs an equivalent learning formulation for canonical
calibration with boundedness. On this basis, we design a simple yet effective
post-hoc calibration algorithm. Our method not only overcomes the ten
identified limitations but also achieves markedly better performance than
traditional methods, as validated by extensive experiments. We further analyze,
both theoretically and experimentally, the relationship and advantages of our
learning objective compared to traditional proper scoring rule. In summary, our
probabilistic framework derives an approximately equivalent differentiable
objective for learning error-bounded calibrated probabilities, elucidating the
correspondence and convergence properties of computational statistics with
respect to theoretical bounds in canonical calibration. The theoretical
effectiveness is verified on standard post-hoc calibration benchmarks by
achieving state-of-the-art performance. This research offers valuable reference
for learning reliable likelihood in related fields.

Result: 显著减少通信开销，保持收敛速度和模型精度，增强对梯度反转的抵抗能力。

Conclusion: LQ-SGD为分布式学习系统提供了更高效、更鲁棒的优化路径。

Abstract: We propose LQ-SGD (Low-Rank Quantized Stochastic Gradient Descent), an

low-rank approximation and log-quantization techniques, which drastically
reduce the communication overhead, while still ensuring the convergence speed
of training and model accuracy. In addition, LQ-SGD and other compression-based
methods show stronger resistance to gradient inversion than traditional SGD,
providing a more robust and efficient optimization path for distributed
learning systems.

Motivation: 现有GNN解释方法缺乏对中间表示的分层分析，难以支持模型诊断和优化。

Conclusion: SliceGX填补了GNN解释中分层分析的空白，为模型优化和调试提供了新工具。

Abstract: Ensuring the trustworthiness of graph neural networks (GNNs) as black-box
models requires effective explanation methods. Existing GNN explanations
typically apply input perturbations to identify subgraphs that are responsible
for the occurrence of the final output of GNNs. However, such approaches lack
finer-grained, layer-wise analysis of how intermediate representations
contribute to the final result, capabilities that are crucial for model
diagnosis and architecture optimization. This paper introduces SliceGX, a novel
GNN explanation approach that generates explanations at specific GNN layers in
a progressive manner. Given a GNN M, a set of selected intermediate layers, and
a target layer, SliceGX automatically segments M into layer blocks ("model
slice") and discovers high-quality explanatory subgraphs in each layer block
that clarifies the occurrence of output of M at the targeted layer. Although
finding such layer-wise explanations is computationally challenging, we develop
efficient algorithms and optimization techniques that incrementally generate
and maintain these subgraphs with provable approximation guarantees.
Additionally, SliceGX offers a SPARQL-like query interface, providing
declarative access and search capacities for the generated explanations.
Through experiments on large real-world graphs and representative GNN
architectures, we verify the effectiveness and efficiency of SliceGX, and
illustrate its practical utility in supporting model debugging.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现，使用未经过滤的文本嵌入（TE）训练模型会导致模型崩溃，预测结果趋向单一类别。TE质量显著影响下游学习，且可能导致虚假的准确性相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨TE作为数据过滤层的有效性及其对模型性能的影响。

Method: 比较相同超参数配置下，基于原始表格数据和TE数据的模型训练，并引入度量模型崩溃程度的指标。

Result: TE无法有效作为过滤层，其质量显著影响学习效果，且模型崩溃可能导致虚假的准确性相关。

Conclusion: 需更细致地过滤和评估基于嵌入的表征，尤其是在分布外场景中。

Abstract: Training models on uncurated Text Embeddings (TEs) derived from raw tabular
data can lead to a severe failure mode known as model collapse, where
predictions converge to a single class regardless of input. By comparing models
trained with identical hyper-parameter configurations on both raw tabular data
and their TE-derived counterparts, we find that collapse is a consistent
failure mode in the latter setting. We introduce a set of metrics that capture
the extent of model collapse, offering a new perspective on TE quality as a
proxy for data curation. Our results reveal that TE alone does not effectively
function as a curation layer - and that their quality significantly influences
downstream learning. More insidiously, we observe that the presence of model
collapse can yield artificially inflated and spurious Accuracy-on-the-Line
correlation. These findings highlight the need for more nuanced curation and
evaluation of embedding-based representations, particularly in
out-of-distribution settings.

TL;DR: 本文综述了生成对抗网络（GANs）在纵向数据分类（LDC）中的应用，重点关注其是否解决了数据的基本假设问题，并提出了未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纵向数据的复杂性和缺失值问题对LDC准确性造成挑战，GANs在解决这些问题上显示出潜力，但需进一步研究。

Method: 通过分类GANs在纵向数据插补（LDI）中的主要方法，分析其优缺点，并识别研究趋势。

Result: GANs在LDI中表现出潜力，但需更灵活的方法应对纵向数据的广泛挑战。

Conclusion: 未来研究应开发更有效的GANs解决方案，以解决LDC中的挑战。

Abstract: Longitudinal data is commonly utilised across various domains, such as
health, biomedical, education and survey studies. This ubiquity has led to a
rise in statistical, machine and deep learning-based methods for Longitudinal
Data Classification (LDC). However, the intricate nature of the data,
characterised by its multi-dimensionality, causes instance-level heterogeneity
and temporal correlations that add to the complexity of longitudinal data
analysis. Additionally, LDC accuracy is often hampered by the pervasiveness of
missing values in longitudinal data. Despite ongoing research that draw on the
generative power and utility of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to
address the missing data problem, critical considerations include statistical
assumptions surrounding longitudinal data and missingness within it, as well as
other data-level challenges like class imbalance and mixed data types that
impact longitudinal data imputation (LDI) and the subsequent LDC process in
GANs. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of how GANs have been
applied in LDI, with a focus whether GANS have adequately addressed fundamental
assumptions about the data from a LDC perspective. We propose a categorisation
of main approaches to GAN-based LDI, highlight strengths and limitations of
methods, identify key research trends, and provide promising future directions.
Our findings indicate that while GANs show great potential for LDI to improve
usability and quality of longitudinal data for tasks like LDC, there is need
for more versatile approaches that can handle the wider spectrum of challenges
presented by longitudinal data with missing values. By synthesising current
knowledge and identifying critical research gaps, this survey aims to guide
future research efforts in developing more effective GAN-based solutions to
address LDC challenges.

Motivation: 理解信息如何在Transformer模型中传播是解释性的关键挑战。

Method: 通过实验分析标记扰动对嵌入空间的影响，研究扰动在层间的传播。

Result: 罕见标记通常导致更大的嵌入偏移，深层信息逐渐混合。

Conclusion: 结合标记扰动和嵌入空间偏移是模型解释性的有力工具。

Abstract: Understanding how information propagates through Transformer models is a key
challenge for interpretability. In this work, we study the effects of minimal
token perturbations on the embedding space. In our experiments, we analyze the
frequency of which tokens yield to minimal shifts, highlighting that rare
tokens usually lead to larger shifts. Moreover, we study how perturbations
propagate across layers, demonstrating that input information is increasingly
intermixed in deeper layers. Our findings validate the common assumption that
the first layers of a model can be used as proxies for model explanations.
Overall, this work introduces the combination of token perturbations and shifts
on the embedding space as a powerful tool for model interpretability.

Motivation: 分布式学习中，拜占庭攻击和数据投毒攻击对泛化性能的影响尚未明确，本文旨在填补这一理论空白。

Method: 通过理论分析，比较两种攻击模型下稳健分布式学习算法的均匀算法稳定性及其对泛化误差的影响。

Result: 拜占庭攻击导致泛化误差的退化比数据投毒攻击更严重，尤其在恶意节点数量接近上限时。

Conclusion: 拜占庭攻击对分布式学习的泛化性能具有更大的破坏性，这一发现为未来防御策略的设计提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Robust distributed learning algorithms aim to maintain good performance in
distributed and federated settings, even in the presence of misbehaving
workers. Two primary threat models have been studied: Byzantine attacks, where
misbehaving workers can send arbitrarily corrupted updates, and data poisoning
attacks, where misbehavior is limited to manipulation of local training data.
While prior work has shown comparable optimization error under both threat
models, a fundamental question remains open: How do these threat models impact
generalization? Empirical evidence suggests a gap between the two threat
models, yet it remains unclear whether it is fundamental or merely an artifact
of suboptimal attacks. In this work, we present the first theoretical
investigation into this problem, formally showing that Byzantine attacks are
intrinsically more harmful to generalization than data poisoning. Specifically,
we prove that: (i) under data poisoning, the uniform algorithmic stability of a
robust distributed learning algorithm, with optimal optimization error,
degrades by an additive factor of $\varTheta ( \frac{f}{n-f} )$, with $f$ the
number of misbehaving workers out of $n$; and (ii) In contrast, under Byzantine
attacks, the degradation is in $\mathcal{O} \big( \sqrt{ \frac{f}{n-2f}}
\big)$.This difference in stability leads to a generalization error gap that is
especially significant as $f$ approaches its maximum value $\frac{n}{2}$.

Motivation: 探究大型语言模型在训练和部署时对有害查询的响应差异，以及对齐伪装行为的动机和影响因素。

Method: 分析了25个模型，通过扰动场景细节研究5个模型的动机，并探讨了训练后调整对对齐伪装行为的影响。

Result: 仅5个模型在训练时更易遵守有害查询，Claude 3 Opus的行为主要由目标保持驱动。训练后调整可能抑制或放大对齐伪装行为。

Conclusion: 对齐伪装行为在大型语言模型中存在差异，Claude 3 Opus的行为具有一致性，而其他模型的行为可能受训练后调整影响。

Abstract: Alignment faking in large language models presented a demonstration of Claude
3 Opus and Claude 3.5 Sonnet selectively complying with a helpful-only training
objective to prevent modification of their behavior outside of training. We
expand this analysis to 25 models and find that only 5 (Claude 3 Opus, Claude
3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3 405B, Grok 3, Gemini 2.0 Flash) comply with harmful queries
more when they infer they are in training than when they infer they are in
deployment. First, we study the motivations of these 5 models. Results from
perturbing details of the scenario suggest that only Claude 3 Opus's compliance
gap is primarily and consistently motivated by trying to keep its goals.
Second, we investigate why many chat models don't fake alignment. Our results
suggest this is not entirely due to a lack of capabilities: many base models
fake alignment some of the time, and post-training eliminates alignment-faking
for some models and amplifies it for others. We investigate 5 hypotheses for
how post-training may suppress alignment faking and find that variations in
refusal behavior may account for a significant portion of differences in
alignment faking.

Abstract: Neural networks have demonstrated a wide range of successes, but their

Previous research on ReLU networks has sought to unwrap these networks into
linear models based on activation states of all hidden units. In this paper, we
introduce a novel approach that considers subsets of the hidden units involved
in the decision making path. This pathwise explanation provides a clearer and
more consistent understanding of the relationship between the input and the
decision-making process. Our method also offers flexibility in adjusting the
range of explanations within the input, i.e., from an overall attribution input
to particular components within the input. Furthermore, it allows for the
decomposition of explanations for a given input for more detailed explanations.
Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms others both quantitatively
and qualitatively.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) plays an important role in many domains
such as finance, transportation, and healthcare. With the ongoing
instrumentation of reality, more time series data will be available, leading
also to growing demands for TSAD. While many TSAD methods already exist, new
and better methods are still desirable. However, effective progress hinges on
the availability of reliable means of evaluating new methods and comparing them
with existing methods. We address deficiencies in current evaluation procedures
related to datasets and experimental settings and protocols. Specifically, we
propose a new time series anomaly detection benchmark, called TAB. First, TAB
encompasses 29 public multivariate datasets and 1,635 univariate time series
from different domains to facilitate more comprehensive evaluations on diverse
datasets. Second, TAB covers a variety of TSAD methods, including Non-learning,
Machine learning, Deep learning, LLM-based, and Time-series pre-trained
methods. Third, TAB features a unified and automated evaluation pipeline that
enables fair and easy evaluation of TSAD methods. Finally, we employ TAB to
evaluate existing TSAD methods and report on the outcomes, thereby offering a
deeper insight into the performance of these methods. Besides, all datasets and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调（SFT）依赖密集的真实标签，成本高；强化学习（RL）则因稀疏奖励和大输出空间而难以应对长序列任务。

Method: 引入自适应回溯（AdaBack），一种基于样本的课程学习算法，动态调整每个样本的监督长度，逐步学习完成推理链。

Result: 在合成任务和数学推理基准测试中，AdaBack解决了传统方法无法处理的复杂问题。

Conclusion: 部分监督的课程学习在长序列任务中优于SFT和RL，能够通过逐步学习实现新的推理能力。

Abstract: We propose that reinforcement learning (RL) from partial expert
demonstrations is not merely a training heuristic, but a promising framework
for solving complex sequence generation tasks. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
relies on dense ground-truth labels, which become increasingly costly as
sequence length grows. RL, on the other hand, struggles with sparse rewards and
a combinatorially large output space. We address this by introducing adaptive
backtracking (AdaBack), a per-sample curriculum learning algorithm that reveals
only a partial prefix of the target output during training. The supervision
length is adjusted dynamically for each sample based on the model's past reward
signal, allowing it to incrementally learn to complete reasoning chains by
conditioning on correct partial solutions. We investigate this intermediate
regime between SFT and RL and argue that per-sample curriculum learning is more
than a trade-off between efficiency and generality, it can succeed in tasks
with long sequences of latent dependencies where SFT and RL both fail to
generalize. Using a synthetic task with latent parity constraints, we show that
our adaptive curriculum over partial answers reliably solves problems that are
otherwise intractable. On mathematical reasoning benchmarks (MATH, GSM8k), we
find that curriculum learning enables models to solve problems that RL alone
cannot, acquiring new reasoning capabilities through incremental exposure to
partial solutions.

association and an object birth model. More recent methods are fully
data-driven and rely on the training of neural networks. Both approaches offer
distinct advantages in specific settings. In particular, model-based methods
are generally applicable across a wide range of scenarios, whereas data-driven
MOT achieves superior performance in scenarios where abundant labeled data for
training is available. A natural thought is whether a general framework can
integrate the two approaches. This paper introduces a hybrid method that
utilizes neural networks to enhance specific aspects of the statistical model
in Bayesian MOT that have been identified as overly simplistic. By doing so,
the performance of the prediction and update steps of Bayesian MOT is improved.
To ensure tractable computation, our framework uses belief propagation to avoid
high-dimensional operations combined with sequential Monte Carlo methods to
perform low-dimensional operations efficiently. The resulting method combines
the flexibility and robustness of model-based approaches with the capability to
learn complex information from data of neural networks. We evaluate the
performance of the proposed method based on the nuScenes autonomous driving
dataset and demonstrate that it has state-of-the-art performance

TL;DR: RoM（Routing Mamba）通过稀疏混合线性投影专家扩展SSM参数，提升Mamba模型的表达能力和效率，在1.3B参数规模下达到与密集模型相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决线性状态空间模型（SSM）在混合专家（MoE）中扩展表达能力的挑战。

Method: 提出RoM方法，通过共享路由决策和轻量子模块，利用线性投影专家的协同效应。

Result: 在1.3B参数规模下，RoM性能与密集模型相当，节省23%计算量。

Conclusion: RoM为SSM提供了一种高效扩展表达能力的解决方案。

Abstract: Linear State Space Models (SSMs) offer remarkable performance gains in
efficient sequence modeling, with constant inference-time computation and
memory complexity. Recent advances, such as Mamba, further enhance SSMs with
input-dependent gating and hardware-aware implementations, positioning them as
strong alternatives to Transformers for long sequence modeling. However,
efficiently scaling the expressive power of SSMs, particularly with Mixture of
Experts (MoE), remains challenging, as naive integration attempts often falter
or degrade performance. In this work, we introduce Routing Mamba (RoM), a novel
approach that scales SSM parameters using sparse mixtures of linear projection
experts. By sharing routing decisions between projection layers and lightweight
sub-modules within Mamba across experts, RoM leverages synergies among linear
projection experts for effective and efficient sparse scaling of Mamba layers.
At a scale of 1.3B active parameters (10B total) and 16K training sequence
length, RoM achieves language modeling performance equivalent to a dense Mamba
model requiring over 2.3x more active parameters, and demonstrates consistent
perplexity across context lengths. Experimental results further show RoM
effectively scales hybrid language models, yielding a 23% FLOPS saving compared
to dense Mamba scaling for similar performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了四种新的概率和强化学习驱动的关联规则挖掘方法，相比传统频率算法更具灵活性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统频率驱动的关联规则挖掘方法（如Apriori、FP-Growth）无法有效处理先验知识、不确定性、项目依赖性和自适应搜索策略，因此需要更先进的方法。

Method: 提出了四种方法：GPAR（高斯过程建模）、BARM（贝叶斯框架）、MAB-ARM（多臂老虎机策略）和RLAR（深度Q网络）。

Result: 实验表明，这些方法在合成和真实数据集上表现优异，尤其适用于罕见或复杂模式的发现和小数据集。

Conclusion: 这些方法标志着从静态频率驱动范式向不确定性感知、可扩展框架的重要转变，适用于零售、金融、医疗等多个领域。

Abstract: This work introduces 4 novel probabilistic and reinforcement-driven methods
for association rule mining (ARM): Gaussian process-based association rule
mining (GPAR), Bayesian ARM (BARM), multi-armed bandit based ARM (MAB-ARM), and
reinforcement learning based association rule mining (RLAR). These methods
depart fundamentally from traditional frequency-based algorithms such as
Apriori, FP-Growth, and Eclat, offering enhanced capabilities for incorporating
prior knowledge, modeling uncertainty, item dependencies, probabilistic
inference and adaptive search strategies. GPAR employs Gaussian processes to
model item co-occurrence via feature representations, enabling principled
inference, uncertainty quantification, and efficient generalization to unseen
itemsets without retraining. BARM adopts a Bayesian framework with priors and
optional correlation structures, yielding robust uncertainty quantification
through full posterior distributions over item presence probabilities. MAB-ARM,
including its Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) companion, utilizes an upper
confidence bound (UCB) strategy for efficient and adaptive exploration of the
itemset space, while RLAR applies a deep Q-network (DQN) to learn a
generalizable policy for identifying high-quality rules. Collectively, these
approaches improve the flexibility and robustness of ARM, particularly for
discovering rare or complex patterns and operating on small datasets. Empirical
results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate their effectiveness,
while also highlighting trade-offs in computational complexity and
interpretability. These innovations mark a significant shift from static,
frequency-driven paradigms, offering some prior and dependency-informed,
uncertainty-aware or scalable ARM frameworks for diverse application domains
such as retail, geography, finance, medical diagnostics, and risk-sensitive
scenarios.

Motivation: 共形预测因其可证明的校准保证在医学分类任务中受到关注，但其在安全关键领域的应用存在潜在问题和假设，需要实践者注意。

Method: 通过皮肤病学和组织病理学的案例，分析了共形预测在输入和标签变量分布变化时的表现。

Result: 共形预测在分布变化时不可靠，不适用于提高准确性或特定数据子集（如单个类别或患者属性），且在类别少的医学图像分类中实用价值有限。

Conclusion: 共形预测在医学分类任务中存在显著局限性，需谨慎使用。

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty estimation is one of the major challenges for medical
classification tasks. While many approaches have been proposed, recently the
statistical framework of conformal predictions has gained a lot of attention,
due to its ability to provide provable calibration guarantees. Nonetheless, the
application of conformal predictions in safety-critical areas such as medicine
comes with pitfalls, limitations and assumptions that practitioners need to be
aware of. We demonstrate through examples from dermatology and histopathology
that conformal predictions are unreliable under distributional shifts in input
and label variables. Additionally, conformal predictions should not be used for
selecting predictions to improve accuracy and are not reliable for subsets of
the data, such as individual classes or patient attributes. Moreover, in
classification settings with a small number of classes, which are common in
medical image classification tasks, conformal predictions have limited
practical value.

Result: 在经典能量景观和分子玻尔兹曼分布等任务中验证了NAAS的有效性。

Conclusion: NAAS是一种高效且可扩展的扩散采样器，避免了重要性采样的缺点。

Abstract: Recently, there has been significant progress in learning-based diffusion
samplers, which aim to sample from a given unnormalized density. These methods
typically follow one of two paradigms: (i) formulating sampling as an unbiased
stochastic optimal control (SOC) problem using a canonical reference process,
or (ii) refining annealed path measures through importance-weighted sampling.
Although annealing approaches have advantages in guiding samples toward
high-density regions, reliance on importance sampling leads to high variance
and limited scalability in practice. In this paper, we introduce the
\textbf{Non-equilibrium Annealed Adjoint Sampler (NAAS)}, a novel SOC-based
diffusion sampler that leverages annealed reference dynamics without resorting
to importance sampling. NAAS employs a lean adjoint system inspired by adjoint
matching, enabling efficient and scalable training. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach across a range of tasks, including sampling from
classical energy landscapes and molecular Boltzmann distribution.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to the development
of thinking language models that generate extensive internal reasoning chains
before producing responses. While these models achieve improved performance,
controlling their reasoning processes remains challenging. This work presents a
steering approach for thinking LLMs by analyzing and manipulating specific
reasoning behaviors in DeepSeek-R1-Distill models. Through a systematic
experiment on 500 tasks across 10 diverse categories, we identify several
reasoning behaviors exhibited by thinking models, including expressing
uncertainty, generating examples for hypothesis validation, and backtracking in
reasoning chains. We demonstrate that these behaviors are mediated by linear
directions in the model's activation space and can be controlled using steering
vectors. By extracting and applying these vectors, we provide a method to
modulate specific aspects of the model's reasoning process, such as its
tendency to backtrack or express uncertainty. Our approach offers practical
tools for steering reasoning processes in thinking models in a controlled and
interpretable manner. We validate our steering method using two
DeepSeek-R1-Distill models, demonstrating consistent control across different
model architectures.

Motivation: 随着SSM模型规模增大，传统PEFT方法未能解决其独特的时间处理动态问题，因此需要专门设计的方法。

Method: 提出Memba，结合LIM神经元、LoRA和跨层膜传递，优化Mamba的时间建模。

Result: 在语言和视觉任务中，Memba显著优于现有PEFT方法。

Conclusion: Memba为Mamba提供了一种高效的微调方案，解决了时间动态处理的挑战。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as powerful alternatives to
attention-based Transformers, with Mamba demonstrating impressive efficiency
and scalability. As these models grow increasingly larger, the need for
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods becomes critical to adapt
pre-trained Mamba to downstream tasks without prohibitive computational costs.
However, previous approaches simply apply traditional Transformer-tailored PEFT
methods without addressing the unique temporal processing dynamics of SSMs. To
address this limitation, we propose Memba, a membrane-driven PEFT approach
specifically designed for Mamba. Memba introduces Leaky Integrate Membrane
(LIM) neurons as bio-inspired gating mechanisms that naturally accumulate
membrane potentials over time, enhancing selective information retention. By
strategically combining LIM neurons with Low-Rank Adaptations (LoRA) and
cross-layer membrane transfer, our approach significantly improves Mamba's
temporal modeling capabilities. Extensive experiments across language and
vision tasks demonstrate that Memba achieves substantial improvements over
existing PEFT methods. The code is available at

Result: 算法在非平稳环境中表现优于基线，实现最低累积遗憾。

Conclusion: 提出的算法有效解决了非平稳环境下的RMABs问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We consider optimal resource allocation for restless multi-armed bandits
(RMABs) in unknown, non-stationary settings. RMABs are PSPACE-hard to solve
optimally, even when all parameters are known. The Whittle index policy is
known to achieve asymptotic optimality for a large class of such problems,
while remaining computationally efficient. In many practical settings, however,
the transition kernels required to compute the Whittle index are unknown and
non-stationary. In this work, we propose an online learning algorithm for
Whittle indices in this setting. Our algorithm first predicts current
transition kernels by solving a linear optimization problem based on upper
confidence bounds and empirical transition probabilities calculated from data
over a sliding window. Then, it computes the Whittle index associated with the
predicted transition kernels. We design these sliding windows and upper
confidence bounds to guarantee sub-linear dynamic regret on the number of
episodes $T$, under the condition that transition kernels change slowly over
time (rate upper bounded by $\epsilon=1/T^k$ with $k>0$). Furthermore, our
proposed algorithm and regret analysis are designed to exploit prior domain
knowledge and structural information of the RMABs to accelerate the learning
process. Numerical results validate that our algorithm achieves superior
performance in terms of lowest cumulative regret relative to baselines in
non-stationary environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have shown promise in accelerating
the discovery of polymers with desired properties by aiding in tasks such as
virtual screening via property prediction. However, progress in polymer ML is
hampered by the scarcity of high-quality labeled datasets, which are necessary

recent 'Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture' (JEPA), a type of architecture
for self-supervised learning (SSL), on polymer molecular graphs to understand
whether pretraining with the proposed SSL strategy improves downstream
performance when labeled data is scarce. Our results indicate that JEPA-based
self-supervised pretraining on polymer graphs enhances downstream performance,
particularly when labeled data is very scarce, achieving improvements across

Result: 发现深度学习模型存在信息饱和瓶颈，导致关键特征丢失，影响迁移性能。

Conclusion: 依赖大规模网络可能不如任务特定训练有效，建议采用更丰富的特征表示方法以提高泛化能力。

Abstract: Transfer learning is a cornerstone of modern machine learning, promising a
way to adapt models pretrained on a broad mix of data to new tasks with minimal
new data. However, a significant challenge remains in ensuring that transferred
features are sufficient to handle unseen datasets, amplified by the difficulty
of quantifying whether two tasks are "related". To address these challenges, we
evaluate model transfer from a pretraining mixture to each of its component
tasks, assessing whether pretrained features can match the performance of
task-specific direct training. We identify a fundamental limitation in deep
learning models -- an "information saturation bottleneck" -- where networks
fail to learn new features once they encode similar competing features during
training. When restricted to learning only a subset of key features during
pretraining, models will permanently lose critical features for transfer and
perform inconsistently on data distributions, even components of the training
mixture. Empirical evidence from published studies suggests that this
phenomenon is pervasive in deep learning architectures -- factors such as data
distribution or ordering affect the features that current representation
learning methods can learn over time. This study suggests that relying solely
on large-scale networks may not be as effective as focusing on task-specific
training, when available. We propose richer feature representations as a
potential solution to better generalize across new datasets and, specifically,
present existing methods alongside a novel approach, the initial steps towards
addressing this challenge.

Conclusion: AdapThink通过动态调整和多样性平衡，显著提升了语言模型的推理效率和适应性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based post-training has significantly advanced
the complex reasoning capabilities of language models, fostering sophisticated
self-reflection processes. However, this ``slow thinking'' paradigm presents a
critical challenge to reasoning efficiency: models may expend excessive
computation on simple questions and shift reasoning prematurely for complex
ones. Previous mechanisms typically rely on static length budgets or predefined
rules, lacking the adaptability for varying question complexities and models'
evolving capabilities. To this end, we propose AdapThink, an adaptive
post-training framework designed to induce more efficient thinking while
maintaining the performance of reasoning language models. Specifically,
AdapThink incorporates two key mechanisms: 1) A group-relative reward function
that leverages model confidence and response's characteristic to dynamically
adjust the preference of reflection-related transition words without resorting
to a fixed length preference. 2) A diversity-aware sampling mechanism that
balances the training group's solution accuracy with reasoning diversity via an
entropy-guided score. Experiments on several mathematical reasoning datasets
with DeepSeek-distilled models demonstrate AdapThink's advantages in enabling
adaptive reasoning patterns and mitigating the inefficiencies.

Abstract: Here in this work, we present a novel Quadratic Binary Optimization (QBO)
model for quantized neural network training, enabling the use of arbitrary
activation and loss functions through spline interpolation. We introduce
Forward Interval Propagation (FIP), a method designed to tackle the challenges
of non-linearity and the multi-layer composite structure in neural networks by
discretizing activation functions into linear subintervals. This approach
preserves the universal approximation properties of neural networks while
allowing complex nonlinear functions to be optimized using quantum computers,
thus broadening their applicability in artificial intelligence. We provide
theoretical upper bounds on the approximation error and the number of Ising
spins required, by deriving the sample complexity of the empirical risk
minimization problem, from an optimization perspective. A significant challenge
in solving the associated Quadratic Constrained Binary Optimization (QCBO)
model on a large scale is the presence of numerous constraints. When employing
the penalty method to handle these constraints, tuning a large number of
penalty coefficients becomes a critical hyperparameter optimization problem,
increasing computational complexity and potentially affecting solution quality.
To address this, we employ the Quantum Conditional Gradient Descent (QCGD)
algorithm, which leverages quantum computing to directly solve the QCBO
problem. We prove the convergence of QCGD under a quantum oracle with
randomness and bounded variance in objective value, as well as under limited
precision constraints in the coefficient matrix. Additionally, we provide an
upper bound on the Time-To-Solution for the QCBO solving process. Experimental
results using a coherent Ising machine (CIM) demonstrate a 94.95% accuracy on
the Fashion MNIST classification task, with only 1.1-bit precision.

Conclusion: DFPT-KD和DFPT-KD+有效解决容量差距问题，显著提升学生网络性能。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) provides an effective way to improve the
performance of a student network under the guidance of pre-trained teachers.
However, this approach usually brings in a large capacity gap between teacher
and student networks, limiting the distillation gains. Previous methods
addressing this problem either discard accurate knowledge representation or
fail to dynamically adjust the transferred knowledge, which is less effective
in addressing the capacity gap problem and hinders students from achieving
comparable performance with the pre-trained teacher. In this work, we extend
the ideology of prompt-based learning to address the capacity gap problem, and
propose Dual-Forward Path Teacher Knowledge Distillation (DFPT-KD), which
replaces the pre-trained teacher with a novel dual-forward path teacher to
supervise the learning of student. The key to DFPT-KD is prompt-based tuning,
i.e., establishing an additional prompt-based forward path within the
pre-trained teacher and optimizing it with the pre-trained teacher frozen to
make the transferred knowledge compatible with the representation ability of
the student. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DFPT-KD leads to trained
students performing better than the vanilla KD. To make the transferred
knowledge better compatible with the representation abilities of the student,
we further fine-tune the whole prompt-based forward path, yielding a novel
distillation approach dubbed DFPT-KD+. By extensive experiments, it is shown
that DFPT-KD+ improves upon DFPT-KD and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
performance.

Abstract: Quantifying and propagating modeling uncertainties is crucial for reliability
analysis, robust optimization, and other model-based algorithmic processes in
engineering design and control. Now, physics-informed machine learning (PIML)
methods have emerged in recent years as a new alternative to traditional
computational modeling and surrogate modeling methods, offering a balance
between computing efficiency, modeling accuracy, and interpretability. However,
their ability to predict and propagate modeling uncertainties remains mostly
unexplored. In this paper, a promising class of auto-differentiable hybrid PIML
architectures that combine partial physics and neural networks or ANNs (for
input transformation or adaptive parameter estimation) is integrated with
Bayesian Neural networks (replacing the ANNs); this is done with the goal to
explore whether BNNs can successfully provision uncertainty propagation
capabilities in the PIML architectures as well, further supported by the
auto-differentiability of these architectures. A two-stage training process is
used to alleviate the challenges traditionally encountered in training
probabilistic ML models. The resulting BNN-integrated PIML architecture is
evaluated on an analytical benchmark problem and flight experiments data for a
fixed-wing RC aircraft, with prediction performance observed to be slightly
worse or at par with purely data-driven ML and original PIML models. Moreover,
Monte Carlo sampling of probabilistic BNN weights was found to be most
effective in propagating uncertainty in the BNN-integrated PIML architectures.

potential in advancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, its success
remains largely confined to mathematical and code domains. This primary
limitation stems from the heavy reliance on domain-specific verifiers, which
results in prohibitive complexity and limited scalability. To address the
challenge, our key observation is that LLM's intrinsic probability of
generating a correct free-form answer directly indicates its own evaluation of
the reasoning reward (i.e., how well the reasoning process leads to the correct
answer). Building on this insight, we propose RLPR, a simple verifier-free
framework that extrapolates RLVR to broader general domains. RLPR uses the
LLM's own token probability scores for reference answers as the reward signal
and maximizes the expected reward during training. We find that addressing the
high variance of this noisy probability reward is crucial to make it work, and
propose prob-to-reward and stabilizing methods to ensure a precise and stable
reward from LLM intrinsic probabilities. Comprehensive experiments in four
general-domain benchmarks and three mathematical benchmarks show that RLPR
consistently improves reasoning capabilities in both areas for Gemma, Llama,
and Qwen based models. Notably, RLPR outperforms concurrent VeriFree by 7.6
points on TheoremQA and 7.5 points on Minerva, and even surpasses strong
verifier-model-dependent approaches General-Reasoner by 1.6 average points
across seven benchmarks.

*Li Tang,Peter A. Torrione,Cihat Eldeniz,Leslie M. Collins*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出基于卡尔曼滤波和粒子滤波的地面反弹（GB）跟踪算法，以提高探地雷达（GPR）对低金属含量地雷的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地面反弹是GPR数据中的主要干扰源，影响地雷检测性能，需开发有效算法以减轻其干扰。

Method: 采用卡尔曼滤波和粒子滤波框架，将GB位置建模为隐藏状态，利用2D雷达图像作为观测数据，并通过自适应参数更新和相邻通道信息传播确保GB表面平滑。

Result: 实验验证了所提算法的有效性，并与其他GB跟踪方法进行了性能对比，显示其能提升地雷检测性能。

Conclusion: 改进的GB跟踪算法显著提升了GPR在地雷检测中的性能。

Abstract: Ground penetrating radar (GPR) provides a promising technology for accurate
subsurface object detection. In particular, it has shown promise for detecting
landmines with low metal content. However, the ground bounce (GB) that is
present in GPR data, which is caused by the dielectric discontinuity between
soil and air, is a major source of interference and degrades landmine detection
performance. To mitigate this interference, GB tracking algorithms formulated
using both a Kalman filter (KF) and a particle filter (PF) framework are
proposed. In particular, the location of the GB in the radar signal is modeled
as the hidden state in a stochastic system for the PF approach. The
observations are the 2D radar images, which arrive scan by scan along the
down-track direction. An initial training stage sets parameters automatically
to accommodate different ground and weather conditions. The features associated
with the GB description are updated adaptively with the arrival of new data.
The prior distribution for a given location is predicted by propagating
information from two adjacent channels/scans, which ensures that the overall GB
surface remains smooth. The proposed algorithms are verified in experiments
utilizing real data, and their performances are compared with other GB tracking
approaches. We demonstrate that improved GB tracking contributes to improved
performance for the landmine detection problem.

TL;DR: ARD-LoRA是一种动态调整秩的自适应方法，通过可学习的缩放因子优化秩分配，显著提升模型效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA方法使用固定秩，无法适应不同层和注意力头的异质性学习动态。

Method: 提出ARD-LoRA框架，通过元目标优化秩分配，结合稀疏性和正则化实现稳定调整。

Result: 在LLAMA-3.1-70B和PaliGemma-2上表现优异，接近全微调性能，参数效率高，内存占用减少41%。

Conclusion: 动态细粒度秩分配是高效基础模型适应的关键范式。

Abstract: Conventional Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) methods employ a fixed rank, imposing
uniform adaptation across transformer layers and attention heads despite their
heterogeneous learning dynamics. This paper introduces Adaptive Rank Dynamic
LoRA (ARD-LoRA), a novel framework that automates rank allocation through
learnable scaling factors. These factors are optimized via a meta-objective
balancing task performance and parameter efficiency, incorporating $\ell_1$
sparsity for minimal rank and Total Variation regularization for stable rank
transitions. ARD-LoRA enables continuous, differentiable, per-head rank
adaptation. Experiments on LLAMA-3.1-70B and PaliGemma-2 demonstrate ARD-LoRA's
efficacy, achieving up to 99.3% of full fine-tuning performance with only 0.32%
trainable parameters, outperforming strong baselines like DoRA and AdaLoRA.
Furthermore, it reduces multimodal adaptation memory by 41%. These results
establish dynamic, fine-grained rank allocation as a critical paradigm for
efficient foundation model adaptation.

Motivation: DAG学习在计算成本和可识别性方面存在挑战，尤其是在小样本场景下。

Method: 提出ADAG架构，利用注意力机制和线性变换器，通过多任务学习捕获共享的低维先验。

Result: 在合成数据集上，ADAG显著提高了DAG学习准确性和零样本推理效率。

Conclusion: ADAG是首个专为DAG学习设计的预训练基础模型，为因果发现提供了更高效和通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Due to its human-interpretability and invariance properties, Directed Acyclic
Graph (DAG) has been a foundational tool across various areas of AI research,
leading to significant advancements. However, DAG learning remains highly
challenging, due to its super-exponential growth in computational cost and
identifiability issues, particularly in small-sample regimes. To address these
two challenges, in this work we leverage the recent success of linear
transformers and develop a foundation model approach for discovering multiple
order-consistent DAGs across tasks. In particular, we propose Attention-DAG
(ADAG), a novel attention-mechanism-based architecture for learning multiple
linear Structural Equation Models (SEMs). ADAG learns the mapping from observed
data to both graph structure and parameters via a nonlinear attention-based
kernel, enabling efficient multi-task estimation of the underlying linear SEMs.
By formulating the learning process across multiple tasks as a continuous
optimization problem, the pre-trained ADAG model captures the common structural
properties as a shared low-dimensional prior, thereby reducing the
ill-posedness of downstream DAG learning tasks in small-sample regimes. We
evaluate our proposed approach on benchmark synthetic datasets and find that
ADAG achieves substantial improvements in both DAG learning accuracy and
zero-shot inference efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
practical approach for pre-training a foundation model specifically designed
for DAG learning, representing a step toward more efficient and generalizable
down-stream applications in causal discovery.

Result: 发现生成分布的稀疏性导致不稳定性，且随着数据维度增加，不稳定性的概率趋近于1。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了扩散重建的固有挑战，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Diffusion reconstruction plays a critical role in various applications such
as image editing, restoration, and style transfer. In theory, the
reconstruction should be simple - it just inverts and regenerates images by
numerically solving the Probability Flow-Ordinary Differential Equation
(PF-ODE). Yet in practice, noticeable reconstruction errors have been observed,
which cannot be well explained by numerical errors. In this work, we identify a
deeper intrinsic property in the PF-ODE generation process, the instability,
that can further amplify the reconstruction errors. The root of this
instability lies in the sparsity inherent in the generation distribution, which
means that the probability is concentrated on scattered and small regions while
the vast majority remains almost empty. To demonstrate the existence of
instability and its amplification on reconstruction error, we conduct
experiments on both toy numerical examples and popular open-sourced diffusion
models. Furthermore, based on the characteristics of image data, we
theoretically prove that the instability's probability converges to one as the
data dimensionality increases. Our findings highlight the inherent challenges
in diffusion-based reconstruction and can offer insights for future
improvements.

Conclusion: GeNeRT通过改进的网络架构和训练策略，有效捕捉射线-表面相互作用的物理原理，实现了高性能的射线追踪。

Abstract: Neural ray tracing (RT) has emerged as a promising paradigm for channel
modeling by combining physical propagation principles with neural networks. It
enables high modeling accuracy and efficiency. However, current neural RT
methods face two key limitations: constrained generalization capability due to
strong spatial dependence, and weak adherence to electromagnetic laws. In this
paper, we propose GeNeRT, a Generalizable Neural RT framework with enhanced
generalization, accuracy and efficiency. GeNeRT supports both intra-scenario
spatial transferability and inter-scenario zero-shot generalization. By
incorporating Fresnel-inspired neural network design, it also achieves higher
accuracy in multipath component (MPC) prediction. Furthermore, a GPU-tensorized
acceleration strategy is introduced to improve runtime efficiency. Extensive
experiments conducted in outdoor scenarios demonstrate that GeNeRT generalizes
well across untrained regions within a scenario and entirely unseen
environments, and achieves superior accuracy in MPC prediction compared to
baselines. Moreover, it outperforms Wireless Insite in runtime efficiency,
particularly in multi-transmitter settings. Ablation experiments validate the
effectiveness of the network architecture and training strategy in capturing
physical principles of ray-surface interactions.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了对抗攻击的效率和稳定性，为自动驾驶系统的安全性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
autonomous driving. However, despite their advanced capabilities, DRL-based
policies remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing serious safety
risks in real-world deployments. Investigating such attacks is crucial for
revealing policy vulnerabilities and guiding the development of more robust
autonomous systems. While prior attack methods have made notable progress, they
still face several challenges: 1) they often rely on high-frequency attacks,
yet critical attack opportunities are typically context-dependent and
temporally sparse, resulting in inefficient attack patterns; 2) restricting
attack frequency can improve efficiency but often results in unstable training
due to the adversary's limited exploration. To address these challenges, we
propose an adaptive expert-guided adversarial attack method that enhances both
the stability and efficiency of attack policy training. Our method first
derives an expert policy from successful attack demonstrations using imitation
learning, strengthened by an ensemble Mixture-of-Experts architecture for
robust generalization across scenarios. This expert policy then guides a
DRL-based adversary through a KL-divergence regularization term. Due to the
diversity of scenarios, expert policies may be imperfect. To address this, we
further introduce a performance-aware annealing strategy that gradually reduces
reliance on the expert as the adversary improves. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves outperforms existing approaches in terms
of collision rate, attack efficiency, and training stability, especially in
cases where the expert policy is sub-optimal.

Conclusion: SKANODE成功实现了高精度与可解释性的平衡，揭示了非线性动态系统的潜在机制。

Abstract: Understanding and modeling nonlinear dynamical systems is a fundamental
problem across scientific and engineering domains. While deep learning has
demonstrated remarkable potential for learning complex system behavior,
achieving models that are both highly accurate and physically interpretable
remains a major challenge. To address this, we propose Structured
Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural ODEs (SKANODEs), a novel framework that integrates
structured state-space modeling with the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN).
SKANODE first employs a fully trainable KAN as a universal function
approximator within a structured Neural ODE framework to perform virtual
sensing, recovering latent states that correspond to physically interpretable
quantities such as positions and velocities. Once this structured latent
representation is established, we exploit the symbolic regression capability of
KAN to extract compact and interpretable expressions for the system's governing
dynamics. The resulting symbolic expression is then substituted back into the
Neural ODE framework and further calibrated through continued training to
refine its coefficients, enhancing both the precision of the discovered
equations and the predictive accuracy of system responses. Extensive
experiments on both simulated and real-world systems demonstrate that SKANODE
achieves superior performance while offering interpretable, physics-consistent
models that uncover the underlying mechanisms of nonlinear dynamical systems.

Abstract: We derive a controlled generation objective within the framework of
Variational Flow Matching (VFM), which casts flow matching as a variational
inference problem. We demonstrate that controlled generation can be implemented
two ways: (1) by way of end-to-end training of conditional generative models,
or (2) as a Bayesian inference problem, enabling post hoc control of
unconditional models without retraining. Furthermore, we establish the
conditions required for equivariant generation and provide an equivariant
formulation of VFM tailored for molecular generation, ensuring invariance to
rotations, translations, and permutations. We evaluate our approach on both
uncontrolled and controlled molecular generation, achieving state-of-the-art
performance on uncontrolled generation and outperforming state-of-the-art
models in controlled generation, both with end-to-end training and in the
Bayesian inference setting. This work strengthens the connection between
flow-based generative modeling and Bayesian inference, offering a scalable and
principled framework for constraint-driven and symmetry-aware generation.

Motivation: 解决MoE架构因内存需求大而难以在资源受限环境中微调或部署的问题。

Conclusion: 结构化剪枝与分阶段蒸馏结合，为创建高质量紧凑MoE模型提供了有效途径。

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as a powerful paradigm
for scaling large language models (LLMs) while maintaining inference
efficiency. However, their enormous memory requirements make them prohibitively
expensive to fine-tune or deploy in resource-constrained environments. To
address this challenge, we introduce SlimMoE, a multi-stage compression
framework for transforming large MoE models into much smaller, efficient
variants without incurring the prohibitive costs of training from scratch. Our
method systematically reduces parameter counts by slimming experts and
transferring knowledge through intermediate stages, effectively mitigating the
performance degradation common in one-shot pruning approaches. Using this
framework, we compress Phi 3.5-MoE (41.9B total/6.6B activated parameters) to
create Phi-mini-MoE (7.6B total/2.4B activated parameters) and Phi-tiny-MoE
(3.8B total/1.1B activated parameters) using only 400B tokens--less than 10% of
the original model's training data. These compressed models can be fine-tuned
on a single GPU (A100 for Phi-mini-MoE, A6000 for Phi-tiny-MoE), making them
highly suitable for academic and resource-limited settings. Our experiments
demonstrate that these compressed models outperform others of similar size and
remain competitive with larger models. For instance, Phi-mini-MoE achieves
similar or better performance to Phi-3-mini using only 2/3 of the activated
parameters and yields comparable MMLU scores to Llama 3.1 8B despite having
significantly lower latency. Our findings demonstrate that structured pruning
combined with staged distillation offers an effective path to creating
high-quality, compact MoE models, paving the way for broader adoption of MoE
architectures. We make our models publicly available at

Method: 1) 引入新数据集LogicPO；2) 采用DPO和KTO等技术微调开源LLMs。

Result: 最佳模型Phi-3.5在逻辑正确性上比GPT-3.5-turbo高10%，语法错误少14%。

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a key task for artificial intelligence due to it's role
in major downstream tasks such as Question Answering, Summarization. Recent
methods in improving the reasoning ability of LLMs fall short in correctly
converting a natural language reasoning problem to an equivalent logical
formulation, which hinders the framework's overall ability to reason. Towards
this, we propose to use finetuning on a preference optimization dataset to
learn to parse and represent a natural language problem as a whole to a
consistent logical program by 1) introducing a new supervised and preference
optimization dataset LogicPO, and 2) adopting popular techniques such as Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), Kahneman-Tversky optimization (KTO) to finetune
open-source LLMs. Our best model with Phi-3.5 consistently outperforms
GPT-3.5-turbo's (8-shot) by producing 10% more logically correct and with 14%
less syntax errors. Through the framework and our improved evaluation metrics,
we offer a promising direction in improving the logical reasoning of LLMs by
better representing them in their logical formulations.

Fuzzy C-Means, then continuously updates micro-cluster centers, densities, and
fuzziness parameters using a Fuzzy Temporal Index (FTI) that measures entropy
evolution. A topology refinement stage performs density-weighted merging and
entropy-guided splitting to guard against over- and under-segmentation. On the
C-NMC leukemia microscopy dataset, our tool achieves a silhouette score of
0.51, demonstrating superior cohesion and separation over static baselines. The
method's adaptive uncertainty modeling and label-free operation hold immediate
potential for integration within the INFANT pediatric oncology network,
enabling scalable, up-to-date support for personalized leukemia management.

TL;DR: 本文提出FreqATT框架，通过频域分析提升时间序列网络的解释性，优于现有方法且更稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络缺乏可解释性，现有方法对时间序列网络的分析不足。

Method: 提出FreqATT框架，通过评估相关频率并过滤或标记输入数据来实现解释。

Result: 频域分析能更突出输入信号的相关区域，且对信号波动更稳健。

Conclusion: FreqATT为时间序列网络提供了一种有效的后验解释方法。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are among the most successful algorithms in terms of
performance and scalability in different domains. However, since these networks
are black boxes, their usability is severely restricted due to the lack of
interpretability. Existing interpretability methods do not address the analysis
of time-series-based networks specifically enough. This paper shows that an
analysis in the frequency domain can not only highlight relevant areas in the
input signal better than existing methods, but is also more robust to
fluctuations in the signal. In this paper, FreqATT is presented, a framework
that enables post-hoc networks to interpret time series analysis. To achieve
this, the relevant different frequencies are evaluated and the signal is either
filtered or the relevant input data is marked.

Result: 理论证明ReaPER比PER更高效，实验显示在多种环境（包括Atari-5基准）中表现更优。

Conclusion: ReaPER通过可靠性调整，显著提升了经验回放的效率和学习性能。

Abstract: Experience replay enables data-efficient learning from past experiences in
online reinforcement learning agents. Traditionally, experiences were sampled
uniformly from a replay buffer, regardless of differences in
experience-specific learning potential. In an effort to sample more
efficiently, researchers introduced Prioritized Experience Replay (PER). In
this paper, we propose an extension to PER by introducing a novel measure of
temporal difference error reliability. We theoretically show that the resulting
transition selection algorithm, Reliability-adjusted Prioritized Experience
Replay (ReaPER), enables more efficient learning than PER. We further present
empirical results showing that ReaPER outperforms PER across various
environment types, including the Atari-5 benchmark.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AnalogNAS-Bench是首个专为模拟内存计算（AIMC）设计的NAS基准，揭示了标准量化技术无法捕捉AIMC噪声、鲁棒架构倾向于更宽和分块结构、跳跃连接增强对时间漂移噪声的抵抗性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经网络未针对AIMC的非理想特性优化，需专门NAS基准以支持AIMC优化的架构搜索。

Method: 提出AnalogNAS-Bench基准，通过实验分析AIMC非理想性对架构的影响。

Result: 发现标准量化技术不足、鲁棒架构特征及跳跃连接的优势。

Conclusion: 当前NAS基准对AIMC有限，需未来研究开发更适配的NAS方法。

Abstract: Analog In-memory Computing (AIMC) has emerged as a highly efficient paradigm
for accelerating Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), offering significant energy and
latency benefits over conventional digital hardware. However, state-of-the-art
neural networks are not inherently designed for AIMC, as they fail to account
for its unique non-idealities. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is thus needed
to systematically discover neural architectures optimized explicitly for AIMC
constraints. However, comparing NAS methodologies and extracting insights about
robust architectures for AIMC requires a dedicated NAS benchmark that
explicitly accounts for AIMC-specific hardware non-idealities. To address this,
we introduce AnalogNAS-Bench, the first NAS benchmark tailored specifically for
AIMC. Our study reveals three key insights: (1) standard quantization
techniques fail to capture AIMC-specific noises, (2) robust architectures tend
to feature wider and branched blocks, (3) skip connections improve resilience
to temporal drift noise. These insights highlight the limitations of current
NAS benchmarks for AIMC and pave the way for future analog-aware NAS. All the
implementations used in this paper can be found at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Pucktrick是一个Python库，用于向合成数据集中引入可控错误，以评估机器学习模型在真实数据缺陷下的鲁棒性。实验表明，使用污染后的合成数据训练的模型表现优于使用纯净合成数据的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于隐私和可用性问题，真实数据集难以获取，而合成数据通常过于干净，缺乏真实数据的缺陷，影响模型泛化能力。

Method: 开发Pucktrick库，支持多种错误类型（如缺失值、噪声、异常值等），提供两种污染模式。

Result: 实验证明，使用污染合成数据训练的模型（尤其是树模型和线性模型）表现更好。

Conclusion: Pucktrick为评估模型鲁棒性提供了有效工具，污染合成数据有助于提升模型性能。

Abstract: The increasing reliance on machine learning (ML) models for decision-making
requires high-quality training data. However, access to real-world datasets is
often restricted due to privacy concerns, proprietary restrictions, and
incomplete data availability. As a result, synthetic data generation (SDG) has
emerged as a viable alternative, enabling the creation of artificial datasets
that preserve the statistical properties of real data while ensuring privacy
compliance. Despite its advantages, synthetic data is often overly clean and
lacks real-world imperfections, such as missing values, noise, outliers, and
misclassified labels, which can significantly impact model generalization and
robustness. To address this limitation, we introduce Pucktrick, a Python
library designed to systematically contaminate synthetic datasets by
introducing controlled errors. The library supports multiple error types,
including missing data, noisy values, outliers, label misclassification,
duplication, and class imbalance, offering a structured approach to evaluating
ML model resilience under real-world data imperfections. Pucktrick provides two
contamination modes: one for injecting errors into clean datasets and another
for further corrupting already contaminated datasets. Through extensive
experiments on real-world financial datasets, we evaluate the impact of
systematic data contamination on model performance. Our findings demonstrate
that ML models trained on contaminated synthetic data outperform those trained
on purely synthetic, error-free data, particularly for tree-based and linear
models such as SVMs and Extra Trees.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统符号回归方法难以捕捉ODE的时空动态和变量相关性，且现有方法（如ODEFormer）对初始点敏感，评估不全面。

Method: 引入DIV-diff度量标准，评估变量空间中的发散性；提出DDOT模型，通过预测ODE导数辅助任务重建ODE符号形式。

Result: 在ODEBench上，DDOT在重建和泛化任务中分别提升4.58%和1.62%，DIV-diff降低3.55%，并在实际麻醉数据中验证了实用性。

Conclusion: DDOT和DIV-diff为ODE重建提供了更稳定和全面的解决方案，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Uncovering the underlying ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that govern
dynamic systems is crucial for advancing our understanding of complex
phenomena. Traditional symbolic regression methods often struggle to capture
the temporal dynamics and intervariable correlations inherent in ODEs.
ODEFormer, a state-of-the-art method for inferring multidimensional ODEs from
single trajectories, has made notable progress. However, its focus on
single-trajectory evaluation is highly sensitive to initial starting points,
which may not fully reflect true performance. To address this, we propose the
divergence difference metric (DIV-diff), which evaluates divergence over a grid
of points within the target region, offering a comprehensive and stable
analysis of the variable space. Alongside, we introduce DDOT
(Derivative-Directed Dual-Decoder Ordinary Differential Equation Transformer),
a transformer-based model designed to reconstruct multidimensional ODEs in
symbolic form. By incorporating an auxiliary task predicting the ODE's
derivative, DDOT effectively captures both structure and dynamic behavior.
Experiments on ODEBench show DDOT outperforms existing symbolic regression
methods, achieving an absolute improvement of 4.58% and 1.62% in $P(R^2 > 0.9)$
for reconstruction and generalization tasks, respectively, and an absolute
reduction of 3.55% in DIV-diff. Furthermore, DDOT demonstrates real-world
applicability on an anesthesia dataset, highlighting its practical impact.

Method: 讨论了联邦学习在化学工程多个领域的潜在应用，并通过两个案例研究（二元混合物活性系数预测和蒸馏柱系统识别）验证其有效性。

Result: 联邦学习联合训练的模型比单独训练的模型准确性显著提高，且性能接近所有数据合并训练的模型。

Conclusion: 联邦学习在保护数据隐私的同时，有望推动化学工程中机器学习的发展，具有工业应用潜力。

Abstract: We present a perspective on federated learning in chemical engineering that
envisions collaborative efforts in machine learning (ML) developments within
the chemical industry. Large amounts of chemical and process data are
proprietary to chemical companies and are therefore locked in data silos,
hindering the training of ML models on large data sets in chemical engineering.
Recently, the concept of federated learning has gained increasing attention in
ML research, enabling organizations to jointly train machine learning models
without disclosure of their individual data. We discuss potential applications
of federated learning in several fields of chemical engineering, from the
molecular to the process scale. In addition, we apply federated learning in two
exemplary case studies that simulate practical scenarios of multiple chemical
companies holding proprietary data sets: (i) prediction of binary mixture
activity coefficients with graph neural networks and (ii) system identification
of a distillation column with autoencoders. Our results indicate that ML models
jointly trained with federated learning yield significantly higher accuracy
than models trained by each chemical company individually and can perform
similarly to models trained on combined datasets from all companies. Federated
learning has therefore great potential to advance ML models in chemical
engineering while respecting corporate data privacy, making it promising for
future industrial applications.

Conclusion: 提出的框架为理解Lipschitz连续性的动态提供了理论基础，并揭示了训练参数对其演化的影响。

Abstract: Lipschitz continuity characterizes the worst-case sensitivity of neural
networks to small input perturbations; yet its dynamics (i.e. temporal
evolution) during training remains under-explored. We present a rigorous
mathematical framework to model the temporal evolution of Lipschitz continuity
during training with stochastic gradient descent (SGD). This framework
leverages a system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to capture both
deterministic and stochastic forces. Our theoretical analysis identifies three
principal factors driving the evolution: (i) the projection of gradient flows,
induced by the optimization dynamics, onto the operator-norm Jacobian of
parameter matrices; (ii) the projection of gradient noise, arising from the
randomness in mini-batch sampling, onto the operator-norm Jacobian; and (iii)
the projection of the gradient noise onto the operator-norm Hessian of
parameter matrices. Furthermore, our theoretical framework sheds light on such
as how noisy supervision, parameter initialization, batch size, and mini-batch
sampling trajectories, among other factors, shape the evolution of the
Lipschitz continuity of neural networks. Our experimental results demonstrate
strong agreement between the theoretical implications and the observed
behaviors.

Result: 减少了分类偏置，提高了最差群体准确率。

Conclusion: 展示了在分类模型中无需训练即可低成本缓解偏置的有效方法。

Abstract: Neural network classifiers trained on datasets with uneven group
representation often inherit class biases and learn spurious correlations.
These models may perform well on average but consistently fail on atypical
groups. For example, in hair color classification, datasets may over-represent
females with blond hair, reinforcing stereotypes. Although various algorithmic
and data-centric methods have been proposed to address such biases, they often
require retraining or significant compute. In this work, we propose a cheap,
training-free method inspired by steering vectors used to edit behaviors in
large language models. We compute the difference in mean activations between
majority and minority groups to define a "bias vector," which we subtract from
the model's residual stream. This leads to reduced classification bias and
improved worst-group accuracy. We explore multiple strategies for extracting
and applying these vectors in transformer-like classifiers, showing that
steering vectors, traditionally used in generative models, can also be
effective in classification. More broadly, we showcase an extremely cheap,
inference time, training free method to mitigate bias in classification models.

Conclusion: 该框架简化了训练过程，适用于多种问题形式，并能轻松扩展到均值场目标。

Abstract: We present a novel simulation-free framework for training continuous-time
diffusion processes over very general objective functions. Existing methods
typically involve either prescribing the optimal diffusion process -- which
only works for heavily restricted problem formulations -- or require expensive
simulation to numerically obtain the time-dependent densities and sample from
the diffusion process. In contrast, we propose a coupled parameterization which
jointly models a time-dependent density function, or probability path, and the
dynamics of a diffusion process that generates this probability path. To
accomplish this, our approach directly bakes in the Fokker-Planck equation and
density function requirements as hard constraints, by extending and greatly
simplifying the construction of Neural Conservation Laws. This enables
simulation-free training for a large variety of problem formulations, from
data-driven objectives as in generative modeling and dynamical optimal
transport, to optimality-based objectives as in stochastic optimal control,
with straightforward extensions to mean-field objectives due to the ease of
accessing exact density functions. We validate our method in a diverse range of
application domains from modeling spatio-temporal events to learning optimal
dynamics from population data.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning, the softmax parametrization is the standard
approach for policies over discrete action spaces. However, it fails to capture
the order relationship between actions. Motivated by a real-world industrial
problem, we propose a novel policy parametrization based on ordinal regression

practical challenges, and numerical experiments demonstrate its effectiveness
in real applications and in continuous action tasks, where discretizing the
action space and applying the ordinal policy yields competitive performance.

Conclusion: 该方法为光子学逆向设计提供了高效的RL基准，并为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Inverse design of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) has traditionally
relied on gradientbased optimization. However, this approach is prone to end up
in local minima, which results in suboptimal design functionality. As interest
in PICs increases due to their potential for addressing modern hardware demands
through optical computing, more adaptive optimization algorithms are needed. We
present a reinforcement learning (RL) environment as well as multi-agent RL
algorithms for the design of PICs. By discretizing the design space into a
grid, we formulate the design task as an optimization problem with thousands of
binary variables. We consider multiple two- and three-dimensional design tasks
that represent PIC components for an optical computing system. By decomposing
the design space into thousands of individual agents, our algorithms are able
to optimize designs with only a few thousand environment samples. They
outperform previous state-of-the-art gradient-based optimization in both twoand
three-dimensional design tasks. Our work may also serve as a benchmark for
further exploration of sample-efficient RL for inverse design in photonics.

Conclusion: 不确定性指标在指导对称性感知模型选择方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Equivariant models leverage prior knowledge on symmetries to improve
predictive performance, but misspecified architectural constraints can harm it
instead. While work has explored learning or relaxing constraints, selecting
among pretrained models with varying symmetry biases remains challenging. We
examine this model selection task from an uncertainty-aware perspective,
comparing frequentist (via Conformal Prediction), Bayesian (via the marginal
likelihood), and calibration-based measures to naive error-based evaluation. We
find that uncertainty metrics generally align with predictive performance, but
Bayesian model evidence does so inconsistently. We attribute this to a mismatch
in Bayesian and geometric notions of model complexity, and discuss possible
remedies. Our findings point towards the potential of uncertainty in guiding
symmetry-aware model selection.

Conclusion: ReDit有效解决了离散奖励的梯度问题，提升了训练效率和模型性能，并通过理论分析验证了其优势。

Abstract: DeepSeek-R1 has successfully enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning
capabilities through its rule-based reward system. While it's a ''perfect''
reward system that effectively mitigates reward hacking, such reward functions
are often discrete. Our experimental observations suggest that discrete rewards
can lead to gradient anomaly, unstable optimization, and slow convergence. To
address this issue, we propose ReDit (Reward Dithering), a method that dithers
the discrete reward signal by adding simple random noise. With this perturbed
reward, exploratory gradients are continuously provided throughout the learning
process, enabling smoother gradient updates and accelerating convergence. The
injected noise also introduces stochasticity into flat reward regions,
encouraging the model to explore novel policies and escape local optima.
Experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency
of ReDit. On average, ReDit achieves performance comparable to vanilla GRPO
with only approximately 10% the training steps, and furthermore, still exhibits
a 4% performance improvement over vanilla GRPO when trained for a similar
duration. Visualizations confirm significant mitigation of gradient issues with
ReDit. Moreover, theoretical analyses are provided to further validate these
advantages.

Abstract: Most existing multi-kernel clustering algorithms, such as multi-kernel
K-means, often struggle with computational efficiency and robustness when faced
with complex data distributions. These challenges stem from their dependence on
point-to-point relationships for optimization, which can lead to difficulty in
accurately capturing data sets' inherent structure and diversity. Additionally,
the intricate interplay between multiple kernels in such algorithms can further
exacerbate these issues, effectively impacting their ability to cluster data
points in high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we leverage granular-ball
computing to improve the multi-kernel clustering framework. The core of
granular-ball computing is to adaptively fit data distribution by balls from
coarse to acceptable levels. Each ball can enclose data points based on a
density consistency measurement. Such ball-based data description thus improves
the computational efficiency and the robustness to unknown noises.
Specifically, based on granular-ball representations, we introduce the
granular-ball kernel (GBK) and its corresponding granular-ball multi-kernel
K-means framework (GB-MKKM) for efficient clustering. Using granular-ball
relationships in multiple kernel spaces, the proposed GB-MKKM framework shows
its superiority in efficiency and clustering performance in the empirical
evaluation of various clustering tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习在非独立同分布数据场景下的数据异构性和性能鲁棒性问题。

Result: 在非独立同分布条件下，FedLEx显著优于现有方法，且仅需少量数据和轮次即可实现模型收敛。

Conclusion: FedLEx为联邦学习在多样化应用中的关键挑战提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a groundbreaking paradigm in machine
learning (ML), offering privacy-preserving collaborative model training across
diverse datasets. Despite its promise, FL faces significant hurdles in
non-identically and independently distributed (non-IID) data scenarios, where
most existing methods often struggle with data heterogeneity and lack
robustness in performance. This paper introduces Federated Loss Exploration
(FedLEx), an innovative approach specifically designed to tackle these
challenges. FedLEx distinctively addresses the shortcomings of existing FL
methods in non-IID settings by optimizing its learning behavior for scenarios
in which assumptions about data heterogeneity are impractical or unknown. It
employs a federated loss exploration technique, where clients contribute to a
global guidance matrix by calculating gradient deviations for model parameters.
This matrix serves as a strategic compass to guide clients' gradient updates in
subsequent FL rounds, thereby fostering optimal parameter updates for the
global model. FedLEx effectively navigates the complex loss surfaces inherent
in non-IID data, enhancing knowledge transfer in an efficient manner, since
only a small number of epochs and small amount of data are required to build a
strong global guidance matrix that can achieve model convergence without the
need for additional data sharing or data distribution statics in a large client
scenario. Our extensive experiments with state-of-the art FL algorithms
demonstrate significant improvements in performance, particularly under
realistic non-IID conditions, thus highlighting FedLEx's potential to overcome
critical barriers in diverse FL applications.

Abstract: We investigate language generation in the limit - a model by Kleinberg and
Mullainathan [NeurIPS 2024] and extended by Li, Raman, and Tewari [COLT 2025].
While Kleinberg and Mullainathan proved generation is possible for all
countable collections, Li et al. defined a hierarchy of generation notions
(uniform, non-uniform, and generatable) and explored their feasibility for
uncountable collections.
  Our first set of results resolve two open questions of Li et al. by proving
finite unions of generatable or non-uniformly generatable classes need not be
generatable. These follow from a stronger result: there is a non-uniformly
generatable class and a uniformly generatable class whose union is
non-generatable. This adds to the aspects along which language generation in
the limit is different from traditional tasks in statistical learning theory
like classification, which are closed under finite unions. In particular, it
implies that given two generators for different collections, one cannot combine
them to obtain a single "more powerful" generator, prohibiting this notion of
boosting.
  Our construction also addresses a third open question of Li et al. on whether
there are uncountable classes that are non-uniformly generatable and do not
satisfy the eventually unbounded closure (EUC) condition introduced by Li,
Raman, and Tewari. Our approach utilizes carefully constructed classes along
with a novel diagonalization argument that could be of independent interest in
the growing area of language generation.

### [400] [SaGIF: Improving Individual Fairness in Graph Neural Networks via Similarity Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18696)
*Yuchang Zhu,Jintang Li,Huizhe Zhang,Liang Chen,Zibin Zheng*

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SaGIF的图神经网络方法，通过独立学习相似性表示来提升个体公平性（IF），并在实验中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个体公平性在图神经网络中至关重要，但目前研究缺乏对其成因和相似个体识别的全面理解。

Method: 通过分析个体不公平的原因，提出两种相似性度量方法（拓扑融合和特征融合），并基于此设计SaGIF模型。

Result: SaGIF在多个真实数据集上表现优于现有方法，同时保持了实用性。

Conclusion: SaGIF通过整合相似性表示，显著提升了图神经网络的个体公平性。

Abstract: Individual fairness (IF) in graph neural networks (GNNs), which emphasizes
the need for similar individuals should receive similar outcomes from GNNs, has
been a critical issue. Despite its importance, research in this area has been
largely unexplored in terms of (1) a clear understanding of what induces
individual unfairness in GNNs and (2) a comprehensive consideration of
identifying similar individuals. To bridge these gaps, we conduct a preliminary
analysis to explore the underlying reason for individual unfairness and observe
correlations between IF and similarity consistency, a concept introduced to
evaluate the discrepancy in identifying similar individuals based on graph
structure versus node features. Inspired by our observations, we introduce two
metrics to assess individual similarity from two distinct perspectives:
topology fusion and feature fusion. Building upon these metrics, we propose
Similarity-aware GNNs for Individual Fairness, named SaGIF. The key insight
behind SaGIF is the integration of individual similarities by independently
learning similarity representations, leading to an improvement of IF in GNNs.
Our experiments on several real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of
our proposed metrics and SaGIF. Specifically, SaGIF consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art IF methods while maintaining utility performance. Code is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MAGTKD的多模态锚点门控变换器结合知识蒸馏的方法，用于对话中的情感识别任务，通过增强模态表示和有效整合多模态信息，实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对话中的情感识别（ERC）需要为每个话语生成高效且模态特定的表示，但现有方法忽视了模态对任务的贡献差异，并在帧级别对齐模态时引入了高复杂性。

Method: 使用提示学习增强文本模态表示，知识蒸馏强化较弱模态表示，并引入多模态锚点门控变换器整合多模态话语级表示。

Result: 在IEMOCAP和MELD数据集上的实验表明，知识蒸馏有效增强了模态表示，并在情感识别任务中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MAGTKD通过知识蒸馏和多模态锚点门控变换器，显著提升了情感识别的性能，为多模态情感识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) aims to detect the emotions of
individual utterances within a conversation. Generating efficient and
modality-specific representations for each utterance remains a significant
challenge. Previous studies have proposed various models to integrate features
extracted using different modality-specific encoders. However, they neglect the
varying contributions of modalities to this task and introduce high complexity
by aligning modalities at the frame level. To address these challenges, we
propose the Multi-modal Anchor Gated Transformer with Knowledge Distillation
(MAGTKD) for the ERC task. Specifically, prompt learning is employed to enhance
textual modality representations, while knowledge distillation is utilized to
strengthen representations of weaker modalities. Furthermore, we introduce a
multi-modal anchor gated transformer to effectively integrate utterance-level
representations across modalities. Extensive experiments on the IEMOCAP and
MELD datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of knowledge distillation in
enhancing modality representations and achieve state-of-the-art performance in
emotion recognition. Our code is available at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PARALLELPROMPT是一个用于测量自然用户提示中查询内并行性的基准测试，通过分解提示结构实现延迟降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM服务系统将用户提示视为单一输入，忽略了潜在的可分解结构，导致效率低下。

Method: 利用LLM辅助提示和基于规则的多语言验证，构建包含37,000个真实提示的数据集，并设计执行套件比较串行与并行策略。

Result: 75%以上的数据集可成功解析并行性，实现高达5倍的加速，且质量损失最小。

Conclusion: PARALLELPROMPT为LLM服务中的结构化执行提供了首个标准化测试平台。

Abstract: LLM serving systems typically treat user prompts as monolithic inputs,
optimizing inference through decoding tricks or inter-query batching. However,
many real-world prompts contain latent semantic parallelism--decomposable
structures where subtasks can be executed independently to reduce latency while
preserving meaning. We introduce PARALLELPROMPT, the first benchmark for
measuring intra-query parallelism in natural user prompts. Our dataset
comprises over 37,000 real-world prompts from public LLM chat logs, each
annotated with a structured schema capturing task templates, shared context,
and iteration inputs. These schemas are extracted using LLM-assisted prompting
with rule-based multilingual validation. To evaluate the benefits of
decomposition, we provide an execution suite that benchmarks serial vs.
parallel strategies, measuring latency, structural adherence, and semantic
fidelity. Our results show that intra-query parallelism can be successfully
parsed in over 75% of curated datasets, unlocking up to 5x speedups on tasks
like translation, comprehension, and comparative analysis, with minimal quality
degradation. By releasing this benchmark, curation pipeline, and evaluation
suite, we provide the first standardized testbed for studying structure-aware
execution in LLM serving pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在联邦基础模型（FFM）中，敏感属性的偏见可能导致对少数群体的不公平待遇，现有研究多关注单一敏感属性，无法解释多属性间的依赖关系。

Method: 通过因果发现和推理，扩展FFM结构以同时权衡多个敏感属性，并量化群体公平性背后的因果效应。

Result: 大量实验验证了该方法的有效性，为构建可信赖且公平的FFM系统提供了可解释性见解。

Conclusion: 该研究首次尝试了FFM中多敏感属性群体公平性的因果分析，为未来公平性研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: The deep integration of foundation models (FM) with federated learning (FL)
enhances personalization and scalability for diverse downstream tasks, making
it crucial in sensitive domains like healthcare. Achieving group fairness has
become an increasingly prominent issue in the era of federated foundation
models (FFMs), since biases in sensitive attributes might lead to inequitable
treatment for under-represented demographic groups. Existing studies mostly
focus on achieving fairness with respect to a single sensitive attribute. This
renders them unable to provide clear interpretability of dependencies among
multiple sensitive attributes which is required to achieve group fairness. Our
paper takes the first attempt towards a causal analysis of the relationship
between group fairness across various sensitive attributes in the FFM. We
extend the FFM structure to trade off multiple sensitive attributes
simultaneously and quantify the causal effect behind the group fairness through
causal discovery and inference. Extensive experiments validate its
effectiveness, offering insights into interpretability towards building
trustworthy and fair FFM systems.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Prior work on the learnability of transformers has established its capacity
to approximate specific algorithmic patterns through training under restrictive
architectural assumptions. Fundamentally, these arguments remain data-driven
and therefore can only provide a probabilistic guarantee. Expressivity, on the
contrary, has theoretically been explored to address the problems
\emph{computable} by such architecture. These results proved the
Turing-completeness of transformers, investigated bounds focused on circuit
complexity, and formal logic. Being at the crossroad between learnability and
expressivity, the question remains: \emph{can transformer architectures exactly
simulate an arbitrary attention mechanism, or in particular, the underlying
operations?} In this study, we investigate the transformer encoder's ability to
simulate a vanilla attention mechanism. By constructing a universal simulator
$\mathcal{U}$ composed of transformer encoders, we present algorithmic
solutions to identically replicate attention outputs and the underlying
elementary matrix and activation operations via RASP, a formal framework for
transformer computation. Our proofs, for the first time, show the existence of
an algorithmically achievable data-agnostic solution, previously known to be
approximated only by learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线实验（如A/B测试）通常需要长时间运行以优化长期效果，但传统方法耗时过长。

Method: 结合快速实验（如短期偏置实验）和离线代理（如离策略评估），进行贝叶斯优化。

Result: 能够在短时间内高效优化大规模动作空间的长期效果。

Conclusion: 该方法显著缩短了实验时间，同时保持了优化效果。

Abstract: Online experiments in internet systems, also known as A/B tests, are used for
a wide range of system tuning problems, such as optimizing recommender system
ranking policies and learning adaptive streaming controllers. Decision-makers
generally wish to optimize for long-term treatment effects of the system
changes, which often requires running experiments for a long time as short-term
measurements can be misleading due to non-stationarity in treatment effects
over time. The sequential experimentation strategies--which typically involve
several iterations--can be prohibitively long in such cases. We describe a
novel approach that combines fast experiments (e.g., biased experiments run
only for a few hours or days) and/or offline proxies (e.g., off-policy
evaluation) with long-running, slow experiments to perform sequential, Bayesian
optimization over large action spaces in a short amount of time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生成模型中目标遗忘的问题，避免重新训练或直接访问待遗忘样本的需求。

Method: 利用能量重加权损失和Flow Matching，通过能量代理引导遗忘过程。

Result: 在2D和图像领域验证了框架的有效性，支持可视化解释和定量评估。

Conclusion: ContinualFlow提供了一种有效的目标遗忘方法，无需重新训练或直接访问样本。

Abstract: We introduce ContinualFlow, a principled framework for targeted unlearning in
generative models via Flow Matching. Our method leverages an energy-based
reweighting loss to softly subtract undesired regions of the data distribution
without retraining from scratch or requiring direct access to the samples to be
unlearned. Instead, it relies on energy-based proxies to guide the unlearning
process. We prove that this induces gradients equivalent to Flow Matching
toward a soft mass-subtracted target, and validate the framework through
experiments on 2D and image domains, supported by interpretable visualizations
and quantitative evaluations.

Result: 在焊接缺陷分类和宝马集团生产设施的标志分类案例中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效量化输入不确定性对图像分类模型的影响，为预测质量提供了可靠的分析工具。

Abstract: Integrating advanced communication protocols in production has accelerated
the adoption of data-driven predictive quality methods, notably machine
learning (ML) models. However, ML models in image classification often face
significant uncertainties arising from model, data, and domain shifts. These
uncertainties lead to overconfidence in the classification model's output. To
better understand these models, sensitivity analysis can help to analyze the
relative influence of input parameters on the output. This work investigates
the sensitivity of image classification models used for predictive quality. We
propose modeling the distributional domain shifts of inputs with random
variables and quantifying their impact on the model's outputs using Sobol
indices computed via generalized polynomial chaos (GPC). This approach is
validated through a case study involving a welding defect classification
problem, utilizing a fine-tuned ResNet18 model and an emblem classification
model used in BMW Group production facilities.

Conclusion: 该方法无需领域知识，能自主发现公共话语的显著变化，适用于新闻、政策分析和危机监测。

Abstract: Detecting when public discourse shifts in response to major events is crucial
for understanding societal dynamics. Real-world data is high-dimensional,
sparse, and noisy, making changepoint detection in this domain a challenging
endeavor. In this paper, we leverage neural networks for changepoint detection
in news data, introducing a method based on the so-called learning-by-confusion
scheme, which was originally developed for detecting phase transitions in
physical systems. We train classifiers to distinguish between articles from
different time periods. The resulting classification accuracy is used to
estimate the total variation distance between underlying content distributions,
where significant distances highlight changepoints. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of this method on both synthetic datasets and real-world data
from The Guardian newspaper, successfully identifying major historical events
including 9/11, the COVID-19 pandemic, and presidential elections. Our approach
requires minimal domain knowledge, can autonomously discover significant shifts
in public discourse, and yields a quantitative measure of change in content,
making it valuable for journalism, policy analysis, and crisis monitoring.

Result: 在基准数据集上，准确率提升5.5-12.9个百分点，适应速度加快22-95%。

Conclusion: ShiftEx为动态数据环境中的联邦学习提供了高效、隐私保护的中间件解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized clients without sharing raw data, yet faces significant
challenges in real-world settings where client data distributions evolve
dynamically over time. This paper tackles the critical problem of covariate and
label shifts in streaming FL environments, where non-stationary data
distributions degrade model performance and require adaptive middleware
solutions. We introduce ShiftEx, a shift-aware mixture of experts framework
that dynamically creates and trains specialized global models in response to
detected distribution shifts using Maximum Mean Discrepancy for covariate
shifts. The framework employs a latent memory mechanism for expert reuse and
implements facility location-based optimization to jointly minimize covariate
mismatch, expert creation costs, and label imbalance. Through theoretical
analysis and comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate
5.5-12.9 percentage point accuracy improvements and 22-95 % faster adaptation
compared to state-of-the-art FL baselines across diverse shift scenarios. The
proposed approach offers a scalable, privacy-preserving middleware solution for
FL systems operating in non-stationary, real-world conditions while minimizing
communication and computational overhead.

Motivation: 现有方法在药物-微生物关联研究中缺乏有效的多视图特征融合和协同优化，限制了预测性能。

Method: DCFA_DMP采用对抗学习优化特征空间，提出双向协同注意力机制实现深度特征融合，并结合Transformer图学习。

Conclusion: DCFA_DMP为药物-微生物关联预测提供了高效且可靠的新方法，尤其在多视图特征融合方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: In the study of drug function and precision medicine, identifying new
drug-microbe associations is crucial. However, current methods isolate
association and similarity analysis of drug and microbe, lacking effective
inter-view optimization and coordinated multi-view feature fusion. In our
study, a multi-view Divergence-Convergence Feature Augmentation framework for
Drug-related Microbes Prediction (DCFA_DMP) is proposed, to better learn and
integrate association information and similarity information. In the divergence
phase, DCFA_DMP strengthens the complementarity and diversity between
heterogeneous information and similarity information by performing Adversarial
Learning method between the association network view and different similarity
views, optimizing the feature space. In the convergence phase, a novel
Bidirectional Synergistic Attention Mechanism is proposed to deeply synergize
the complementary features between different views, achieving a deep fusion of
the feature space. Moreover, Transformer graph learning is alternately applied
on the drug-microbe heterogeneous graph, enabling each drug or microbe node to
focus on the most relevant nodes. Numerous experiments demonstrate DCFA_DMP's
significant performance in predicting drug-microbe associations. It also proves
effectiveness in predicting associations for new drugs and microbes in cold
start experiments, further confirming its stability and reliability in
predicting potential drug-microbe associations.

Conclusion: ProQ通过统一几何学习和控制，为长时程任务提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning seeks to train agents to
reach specified goals from previously collected trajectories. Scaling that
promises to long-horizon tasks remains challenging, notably due to compounding
value-estimation errors. Principled geometric offers a potential solution to
address these issues. Following this insight, we introduce Projective
Quasimetric Planning (ProQ), a compositional framework that learns an
asymmetric distance and then repurposes it, firstly as a repulsive energy
forcing a sparse set of keypoints to uniformly spread over the learned latent
space, and secondly as a structured directional cost guiding towards proximal
sub-goals. In particular, ProQ couples this geometry with a Lagrangian
out-of-distribution detector to ensure the learned keypoints stay within
reachable areas. By unifying metric learning, keypoint coverage, and
goal-conditioned control, our approach produces meaningful sub-goals and
robustly drives long-horizon goal-reaching on diverse a navigation benchmarks.

Result: 在二、三、五玩家场景中，N-XPlay训练的智能体在团队内和团队间协作上均优于自博弈方法。

Conclusion: N-XPlay为复杂多智能体系统中的零样本协作提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Zero-shot coordination (ZSC) -- the ability to collaborate with unfamiliar
partners -- is essential to making autonomous agents effective teammates.
Existing ZSC methods evaluate coordination capabilities between two agents who
have not previously interacted. However, these scenarios do not reflect the
complexity of real-world multi-agent systems, where coordination often involves
a hierarchy of sub-groups and interactions between teams of agents, known as
Multi-Team Systems (MTS). To address this gap, we first introduce N-player
Overcooked, an N-agent extension of the popular two-agent ZSC benchmark,
enabling evaluation of ZSC in N-agent scenarios. We then propose N-XPlay for
ZSC in N-agent, multi-team settings. Comparison against Self-Play across two-,
three- and five-player Overcooked scenarios, where agents are split between an
``ego-team'' and a group of unseen collaborators shows that agents trained with
N-XPlay are better able to simultaneously balance ``intra-team'' and
``inter-team'' coordination than agents trained with SP.

Abstract: Multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) play a vital role in monitoring and
data collection in wide area environments with harsh conditions. In most
scenarios, issues such as real-time data retrieval and real-time UAV
positioning are often disregarded, essentially neglecting the communication
constraints. In this paper, we comprehensively address both the coverage of the
target area and the data transmission capabilities of the flying ad hoc network
(FANET). The data throughput of the network is therefore maximized by
optimizing the network topology and the UAV trajectories. The resultant
optimization problem is effectively solved by the proposed reinforcement
learning-based trajectory planning (RL-TP) algorithm and the convex-based
topology optimization (C-TOP) algorithm sequentially. The RL-TP optimizes the
UAV paths while considering the constraints of FANET. The C-TOP maximizes the
data throughput of the network while simultaneously constraining the neighbors
and transmit powers of the UAVs, which is shown to be a convex problem that can
be efficiently solved in polynomial time. Simulations and field experimental
results show that the proposed optimization strategy can effectively plan the
UAV trajectories and significantly improve the data throughput of the FANET
over the adaptive local minimum spanning tree (A-LMST) and cyclic
pruning-assisted power optimization (CPAPO) methods.

frameworks. Instead, we implement a specific SNN architecture (CoLaNET) in Rust
and optimize it for common computing platforms. As a case study, we demonstrate
our implementation, called Spiffy, on a Raspberry Pi using the MNIST dataset.
Spiffy achieves 92% accuracy with low latency - just 0.9 ms per training step
and 0.45 ms per inference step. The code is open-source.

### [416] [Zero-Shot Cognitive Impairment Detection from Speech Using AudioLLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17351)
*Mostafa Shahin,Beena Ahmed,Julien Epps*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于零样本的语音认知障碍检测方法，使用Qwen2-Audio AudioLLM模型，无需手动标注，性能与监督方法相当，且在多语言和多任务中表现一致。


<details>

Abstract: Cognitive impairment (CI) is of growing public health concern, and early
detection is vital for effective intervention. Speech has gained attention as a
non-invasive and easily collectible biomarker for assessing cognitive decline.
Traditional CI detection methods typically rely on supervised models trained on
acoustic and linguistic features extracted from speech, which often require
manual annotation and may not generalise well across datasets and languages. In
this work, we propose the first zero-shot speech-based CI detection method
using the Qwen2- Audio AudioLLM, a model capable of processing both audio and
text inputs. By designing prompt-based instructions, we guide the model in
classifying speech samples as indicative of normal cognition or cognitive
impairment. We evaluate our approach on two datasets: one in English and
another multilingual, spanning different cognitive assessment tasks. Our
results show that the zero-shot AudioLLM approach achieves performance
comparable to supervised methods and exhibits promising generalizability and
consistency across languages, tasks, and datasets.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出一种多分支网络架构，用于水下声源定位，结合CNN和Conformer，引入自适应增益控制层，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下环境复杂多变，声源定位困难，需解决高背景噪声、不规则几何和声学特性变化等问题。

Method: 使用CNN提取空间特征，Conformer捕捉时间依赖性，输入为log-mel谱和GCC-PHAT特征，加入自适应增益控制层。

Result: 在跨域测试中表现优异，仅需少量测试域数据微调，性能超越现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为水下声源定位提供了新基准，适用于复杂环境。

Abstract: Localizing acoustic sound sources in the ocean is a challenging task due to
the complex and dynamic nature of the environment. Factors such as high
background noise, irregular underwater geometries, and varying acoustic
properties make accurate localization difficult. To address these obstacles, we
propose a multi-branch network architecture designed to accurately predict the
distance between a moving acoustic source and a receiver, tested on real-world
underwater signal arrays. The network leverages Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) for robust spatial feature extraction and integrates Conformers with
self-attention mechanism to effectively capture temporal dependencies. Log-mel
spectrogram and generalized cross-correlation with phase transform (GCC-PHAT)
features are employed as input representations. To further enhance the model
performance, we introduce an Adaptive Gain Control (AGC) layer, that adaptively
adjusts the amplitude of input features, ensuring consistent energy levels
across varying ranges, signal strengths, and noise conditions. We assess the
model's generalization capability by training it in one domain and testing it
in a different domain, using only a limited amount of data from the test domain
for fine-tuning. Our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)
approaches in similar settings, establishing new benchmarks for underwater
sound localization.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两阶段训练方法，通过预训练和微调提升作曲家风格的音乐生成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决作曲家风格音乐生成中数据稀缺的问题，利用广泛音乐知识增强特定风格建模。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：预训练基于REMI的音乐生成模型，再通过轻量适配器微调小规模作曲家数据集。

Result: 方法在风格准确性和音乐性上优于基线，实现了更精确的风格建模和更好的音乐美学。

Conclusion: 研究展示了预训练和微调如何帮助模型从通用音乐知识中学习并精炼风格理解。

Abstract: Despite progress in controllable symbolic music generation, data scarcity
remains a challenge for certain control modalities. Composer-style music
generation is a prime example, as only a few pieces per composer are available,
limiting the modeling of both styles and fundamental music elements (e.g.,
melody, chord, rhythm). In this paper, we investigate how general music
knowledge learned from a broad corpus can enhance the mastery of specific
composer styles, with a focus on piano piece generation. Our approach follows a
two-stage training paradigm. First, we pre-train a REMI-based music generation
model on a large corpus of pop, folk, and classical music. Then, we fine-tune
it on a small, human-verified dataset from four renowned composers, namely
Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, and Chopin, using a lightweight adapter module to
condition the model on style indicators. To evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach, we conduct both objective and subjective evaluations on style
accuracy and musicality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
outperforms ablations and baselines, achieving more precise composer-style
modeling and better musical aesthetics. Additionally, we provide observations
on how the model builds music concepts from the generality pre-training and
refines its stylistic understanding through the mastery fine-tuning.

We can take this division further and split the octave into 24 equal tones by
splitting each half-step in two, called a quarter-step. By assigning each of
these 24 notes a number, we can discuss musical actions mathematically. In this
paper, we analyze 24-tone microtonal music and explore how musical and harmonic
structures in this system can be interpreted in terms of group-theoretic
structures. This work extends the study by Crans, Fiore, and Satyendra.

*Julien Guinot,Alain Riou,Elio Quinton,György Fazekas*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: SLAP是一种新型多模态预训练框架，通过无负样本学习解决联合嵌入空间的内存需求和模态差距问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态联合嵌入空间中的内存需求大和模态差距问题。

Method: 采用BYOL范式进行多模态音频-文本训练，无需负样本。

Result: 在文本-音乐检索和零样本分类任务上优于CLAP，并在多个MIR任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: SLAP通过无负样本学习实现了高效的多模态表示学习，具有可扩展性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Joint embedding spaces have significantly advanced music understanding and
generation by linking text and audio through multimodal contrastive learning.
However, these approaches face large memory requirement limitations due to
relying on large batch sizes to effectively utilize negative samples. Further,
multimodal joint embedding spaces suffer from a modality gap wherein embeddings
from different modalities lie in different manifolds of the embedding space. To
address these challenges, we propose Siamese Language-Audio Pretraining (SLAP),
a novel multimodal pretraining framework that allows learning powerful
representations without negative samples. SLAP adapts the Bootstrap Your Own
Latent (BYOL) paradigm for multimodal audio-text training, promoting
scalability in training multimodal embedding spaces.
  We illustrate the ability of our model to learn meaningful relationships
between music and text -- specifically, we show that SLAP outperforms CLAP on
tasks such as text-music retrieval and zero-shot classification. We also
observe competitive downstream performance on several MIR tasks, including with
larger or supervised models (genre and instrument classification,
auto-tagging). Additionally, our approach has attractive properties, such as a
quantifiably reduced modality gap and improved robustness to batch size
variations on retrieval performance. Finally, its novel formulation unlocks
large-scale training on a single GPU through gradient accumulation.

Motivation: 现有音乐基础模型在多样化音乐传统中效果有限，需提升跨文化音乐表示学习能力。

Method: 采用两阶段持续预训练策略，结合学习率调整，训练于650小时多文化音乐数据。

Result: 在非西方音乐自动标注任务中平均提升4.9%性能，同时保持西方基准表现。

Conclusion: 多文化适应模型整体表现最佳，支持世界音乐表示学习的研究发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in music foundation models have improved audio representation
learning, yet their effectiveness across diverse musical traditions remains
limited. We introduce CultureMERT-95M, a multi-culturally adapted foundation
model developed to enhance cross-cultural music representation learning and
understanding. To achieve this, we propose a two-stage continual pre-training
strategy that integrates learning rate re-warming and re-decaying, enabling
stable adaptation even with limited computational resources. Training on a
650-hour multi-cultural data mix, comprising Greek, Turkish, and Indian music
traditions, results in an average improvement of 4.9% in ROC-AUC and AP across
diverse non-Western music auto-tagging tasks, surpassing prior
state-of-the-art, with minimal forgetting on Western-centric benchmarks. We
further investigate task arithmetic, an alternative approach to multi-cultural
adaptation that merges single-culture adapted models in the weight space. Task
arithmetic performs on par with our multi-culturally trained model on
non-Western auto-tagging tasks and shows no regression on Western datasets.
Cross-cultural evaluation reveals that single-culture models transfer with
varying effectiveness across musical traditions, whereas the multi-culturally
adapted model achieves the best overall performance. To support research on
world music representation learning, we publicly release CultureMERT-95M and
CultureMERT-TA-95M, fostering the development of more culturally aware music
foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态对比模型在文本-音频检索和零样本设置中表现良好，但缺乏用户可控性和交互性。文本-音乐检索中自由语言的模糊性导致结果不灵活或不满意。

Method: 引入GDR框架，利用扩散模型生成查询，支持负提示和DDIM反转等生成工具，实现检索行为的后处理控制。

Result: GDR在检索性能上优于对比教师模型，并支持非联合训练编码器的音频潜在空间检索。

Conclusion: GDR为文本-音乐检索任务提供了增强的交互控制，开辟了检索控制的新方向。

Abstract: Multimodal contrastive models have achieved strong performance in text-audio
retrieval and zero-shot settings, but improving joint embedding spaces remains
an active research area. Less attention has been given to making these systems
controllable and interactive for users. In text-music retrieval, the ambiguity
of freeform language creates a many-to-many mapping, often resulting in
inflexible or unsatisfying results.
  We introduce Generative Diffusion Retriever (GDR), a novel framework that
leverages diffusion models to generate queries in a retrieval-optimized latent
space. This enables controllability through generative tools such as negative
prompting and denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIM) inversion, opening a
new direction in retrieval control. GDR improves retrieval performance over
contrastive teacher models and supports retrieval in audio-only latent spaces
using non-jointly trained encoders. Finally, we demonstrate that GDR enables
effective post-hoc manipulation of retrieval behavior, enhancing interactive
control for text-music retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: TCDiff++通过多种创新方法有效解决了群舞生成中的关键问题，达到了当前最佳性能。

Abstract: Music-driven dance generation has garnered significant attention due to its
wide range of industrial applications, particularly in the creation of group
choreography. During the group dance generation process, however, most existing
methods still face three primary issues: multi-dancer collisions, single-dancer
foot sliding and abrupt swapping in the generation of long group dance. In this
paper, we propose TCDiff++, a music-driven end-to-end framework designed to
generate harmonious group dance. Specifically, to mitigate multi-dancer
collisions, we utilize a dancer positioning embedding to better maintain the
relative positioning among dancers. Additionally, we incorporate a
distance-consistency loss to ensure that inter-dancer distances remain within
plausible ranges. To address the issue of single-dancer foot sliding, we
introduce a swap mode embedding to indicate dancer swapping patterns and design
a Footwork Adaptor to refine raw motion, thereby minimizing foot sliding. For
long group dance generation, we present a long group diffusion sampling
strategy that reduces abrupt position shifts by injecting positional
information into the noisy input. Furthermore, we integrate a Sequence Decoder
layer to enhance the model's ability to selectively process long sequences.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TCDiff++ achieves state-of-the-art
performance, particularly in long-duration scenarios, ensuring high-quality and
coherent group dance generation.

Result: 研究表明，在100亿人口中，两人声音相同的概率从几千分之一到万亿分之一以下不等。

Abstract: Voice is increasingly being used as a biometric entity in many applications.
These range from speaker identification and verification systems to human
profiling technologies that attempt to estimate myriad aspects of the speaker's
persona from their voice. However, for an entity to be a true biometric
identifier, it must be unique. This paper establishes a first framework for
calculating the uniqueness of human voice objectively. The approach in this
paper is based on statistical considerations that take into account a set of
measurable characteristics of the voice signal that bear a causal relationship
to the vocal production process, but are not inter-dependent or derivable from
each other. Depending on how we quantize these variables, we show that the
chances of two people having the same voice in a world populated by 10 billion
people range from one in a few thousand, to one in a septillion or less. The
paper also discusses the implications of these calculations on the choices made
in voice processing applications.

Abstract: We construct Japanese Idol Speech Corpus (JIS) to advance research in speech
generation AI, including text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) and voice conversion
(VC). JIS will facilitate more rigorous evaluations of speaker similarity in
TTS and VC systems since all speakers in JIS belong to a highly specific
category: "young female live idols" in Japan, and each speaker is identified by
a stage name, enabling researchers to recruit listeners familiar with these
idols for listening experiments. With its unique speaker attributes, JIS will
foster compelling research, including generating voices tailored to listener
preferences-an area not yet widely studied. JIS will be distributed free of
charge to promote research in speech generation AI, with usage restricted to
non-commercial, basic research. We describe the construction of JIS, provide an
overview of Japanese live idol culture to support effective and ethical use of
JIS, and offer a basic analysis to guide application of JIS.

<details>

Result: 实验表明，用提出的新代表值替代MOSNet的预测目标，提升了预测性能。

Conclusion: 新方法通过更精确地建模评分过程，有效提升了SQA模型的性能。

Abstract: Speech quality assessment (SQA) aims to evaluate the quality of speech
samples without relying on time-consuming listener questionnaires. Recent
efforts have focused on training neural-based SQA models to predict the mean
opinion score (MOS) of speech samples produced by text-to-speech or voice
conversion systems. This paper targets the enhancement of MOS prediction
models' performance. We propose a novel score aggregation method to address the
limitations of conventional annotations for MOS, which typically involve
ratings on a scale from 1 to 5. Our method is based on the hypothesis that
annotators internally consider continuous scores and then choose the nearest
discrete rating. By modeling this process, we approximate the generative
distribution of ratings by quantizing the latent continuous distribution. We
then use the peak of this latent distribution, estimated through the loss
between the quantized distribution and annotated ratings, as a new
representative value instead of MOS. Experimental results demonstrate that
substituting MOSNet's predicted target with this proposed value improves
prediction performance.

Abstract: This paper explores the use of unlearning methods for training data
attribution (TDA) in music generative models trained on large-scale datasets.
TDA aims to identify which specific training data points contributed to the
generation of a particular output from a specific model. This is crucial in the
context of AI-generated music, where proper recognition and credit for original
artists are generally overlooked. By enabling white-box attribution, our work
supports a fairer system for acknowledging artistic contributions and addresses
pressing concerns related to AI ethics and copyright. We apply unlearning-based
attribution to a text-to-music diffusion model trained on a large-scale dataset
and investigate its feasibility and behavior in this setting. To validate the
method, we perform a grid search over different hyperparameter configurations
and quantitatively evaluate the consistency of the unlearning approach. We then
compare attribution patterns from unlearning with those from a similarity-based
approach. Our findings suggest that unlearning-based approaches can be
effectively adapted to music generative models, introducing large-scale TDA to
this domain and paving the way for more ethical and accountable AI systems for
music creation.

Motivation: 人类在评分时可能更关注低质量语音片段，而传统MOS评分忽略了这一点，导致评分不一致。

Method: 分析了VCC2018和BVCC数据集，提出N_low-MOS（最低N个评分的均值）作为更可靠的评分指标，并用于MOSNet训练。

Result: 实验表明，使用N_low-MOS的MOSNet在LCC和SRCC指标上优于传统MOS方法。

Conclusion: N_low-MOS能更准确地反映主观语音质量，提升语音转换模型的比较效果。

Abstract: The automatic speech quality assessment (SQA) has been extensively studied to
predict the speech quality without time-consuming questionnaires. Recently,
neural-based SQA models have been actively developed for speech samples
produced by text-to-speech or voice conversion, with a primary focus on
training mean opinion score (MOS) prediction models. The quality of each speech
sample may not be consistent across the entire duration, and it remains unclear
which segments of the speech receive the primary focus from humans when
assigning subjective evaluation for MOS calculation. We hypothesize that when
humans rate speech, they tend to assign more weight to low-quality speech
segments, and the variance in ratings for each sample is mainly due to
accidental assignment of higher scores when overlooking the poor quality speech
segments. Motivated by the hypothesis, we analyze the VCC2018 and BVCC
datasets. Based on the hypothesis, we propose the more reliable representative
value N_low-MOS, the mean of the $N$-lowest opinion scores. Our experiments
show that LCC and SRCC improve compared to regular MOS when employing N_low-MOS
to MOSNet training. This result suggests that N_low-MOS is a more intrinsic
representative value of subjective speech quality and makes MOSNet a better
comparator of VC models.

Conclusion: 该方法填补了实际应用中的空白，为AI生成音乐的检测提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: The recent rise in capabilities of AI-based music generation tools has
created an upheaval in the music industry, necessitating the creation of
accurate methods to detect such AI-generated content. This can be done using
audio-based detectors; however, it has been shown that they struggle to
generalize to unseen generators or when the audio is perturbed. Furthermore,
recent work used accurate and cleanly formatted lyrics sourced from a lyrics
provider database to detect AI-generated music. However, in practice, such
perfect lyrics are not available (only the audio is); this leaves a substantial
gap in applicability in real-life use cases. In this work, we instead propose
solving this gap by transcribing songs using general automatic speech
recognition (ASR) models. We do this using several detectors. The results on
diverse, multi-genre, and multi-lingual lyrics show generally strong detection
performance across languages and genres, particularly for our best-performing
model using Whisper large-v2 and LLM2Vec embeddings. In addition, we show that
our method is more robust than state-of-the-art audio-based ones when the audio
is perturbed in different ways and when evaluated on different music
generators. Our code is available at

Result: 实验表明，即使文本输入不完美，只要包含时间戳线索，LLM仍能有效生成完整注释转录。

Conclusion: LLM在处理不完美提示时表现出鲁棒性，为不流畅性检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Accurate detection of disfluencies in spoken language is crucial for
enhancing the performance of automatic speech and language processing systems,
as well as fostering the development of more inclusive speech and language
technologies. Leveraging the growing trend of large language models (LLMs) as
versatile learners capable of processing both lexical and non-lexical inputs
(e.g., audio and video), we propose a novel approach to transcribing
disfluencies as explicit tokens with timestamps, enabling the generation of
fully annotated disfluency-rich transcripts. Our method integrates acoustic
representations extracted from an audio encoder with textual inputs of varying
quality: clean transcriptions without disfluencies, time-aligned transcriptions
from aligners, or outputs from phoneme-based ASR models -- all of which may
contain imperfections. Importantly, our experiments demonstrate that textual
inputs do not need to be flawless. As long as they include timestamp-related
cues, LLMs can effectively smooth the input and produce fully
disfluency-annotated transcripts, underscoring their robustness in handling
imperfect hints.

Abstract: Multichannel speech enhancement algorithms are essential for improving the
intelligibility of speech signals in noisy environments. These algorithms are
usually evaluated at the utterance level, but this approach overlooks the
disparities in acoustic characteristics that are observed in different phoneme
categories and between male and female speakers. In this paper, we investigate
the impact of gender and phonetic content on speech enhancement algorithms. We
motivate this approach by outlining phoneme- and gender-specific spectral
features. Our experiments reveal that while utterance-level differences between
genders are minimal, significant variations emerge at the phoneme level.
Results show that the tested algorithms better reduce interference with fewer
artifacts on female speech, particularly in plosives, fricatives, and vowels.
Additionally, they demonstrate greater performance for female speech in terms
of perceptual and speech recognition metrics.

*Nasser-Eddine Monir,Paul Magron,Romain Serizel*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于感知的SDR损失函数变体，通过频域加权策略提升语音增强效果，尤其在保留语音细节方面表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SDR损失函数可能无法保留对语音清晰度至关重要的频谱细节，因此需要改进。

Method: 提出了频域加权的SDR损失函数变体，包括固定和自适应加权策略，并在FaSNet模型上训练。

Result: 实验显示，标准SDR指标提升有限，但感知加权指标显著改善，且语音细节保留更好。

Conclusion: 频域加权策略能有效提升语音增强的感知效果，尤其是辅音重建方面。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved multichannel
speech enhancement algorithms, yet conventional training loss functions such as
the scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) may fail to preserve
fine-grained spectral cues essential for phoneme intelligibility. In this work,
we propose perceptually-informed variants of the SDR loss, formulated in the
time-frequency domain and modulated by frequency-dependent weighting schemes.
These weights are designed to emphasize time-frequency regions where speech is
prominent or where the interfering noise is particularly strong. We investigate
both fixed and adaptive strategies, including ANSI band-importance weights,
spectral magnitude-based weighting, and dynamic weighting based on the relative
amount of speech and noise. We train the FaSNet multichannel speech enhancement
model using these various losses. Experimental results show that while standard
metrics such as the SDR are only marginally improved, their perceptual
frequency-weighted counterparts exhibit a more substantial improvement.
Besides, spectral and phoneme-level analysis indicates better consonant
reconstruction, which points to a better preservation of certain acoustic cues.

TL;DR: MuseControlLite是一种轻量级机制，通过时间变化的音乐属性和参考音频信号，优化文本到音乐生成模型的精确控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到音乐生成模型在时间相关条件（如旋律控制）中表现不佳，缺乏有效的定位嵌入方法。

Method: 在解耦的交叉注意力层中添加旋转位置嵌入，显著提升控制精度，同时减少可训练参数。

Result: 实验显示控制精度从56.6%提升至61.1%，参数减少6.75倍，优于MusicGen-Large和Stable Audio Open ControlNet。

Conclusion: MuseControlLite以更低的微调成本实现了更高的可控性，适用于多种音乐属性控制和音频编辑任务。

Abstract: We propose MuseControlLite, a lightweight mechanism designed to fine-tune
text-to-music generation models for precise conditioning using various
time-varying musical attributes and reference audio signals. The key finding is
that positional embeddings, which have been seldom used by text-to-music
generation models in the conditioner for text conditions, are critical when the
condition of interest is a function of time. Using melody control as an
example, our experiments show that simply adding rotary positional embeddings
to the decoupled cross-attention layers increases control accuracy from 56.6%
to 61.1%, while requiring 6.75 times fewer trainable parameters than
state-of-the-art fine-tuning mechanisms, using the same pre-trained diffusion
Transformer model of Stable Audio Open. We evaluate various forms of musical
attribute control, audio inpainting, and audio outpainting, demonstrating
improved controllability over MusicGen-Large and Stable Audio Open ControlNet
at a significantly lower fine-tuning cost, with only 85M trainble parameters.

models often remain domain-specific, focusing on either speech or non-speech
tasks. In this work, we present Universal Speech and Audio Distillation (USAD),
a unified approach to audio representation learning that integrates diverse

efficient layer-to-layer distillation from domain-specific SSL models to train
a student on a comprehensive audio dataset. USAD offers competitive performance
across various benchmarks and datasets, including frame and instance-level
speech processing tasks, audio tagging, and sound classification, achieving
near state-of-the-art results with a single encoder on SUPERB and HEAR

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于第四代核电站的数字孪生框架，通过数据增强方法优化运行和维护策略，同时满足系统约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 第四代核电站虽具潜力，但高成本阻碍其部署，数字孪生技术可降低成本并提升效率。

Method: 结合替代建模、强化学习和贝叶斯推理，设计闭环框架，通过参考调节器控制算法确保约束合规。

Result: 通过三个案例验证了框架的鲁棒性，展示了长期维护规划、短期精度提升和实时校准能力。

Conclusion: 该数字孪生框架适用于第四代核电站及其他复杂工程系统，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Generation IV (Gen-IV) nuclear power plants are envisioned to replace the
current reactor fleet, bringing improvements in performance, safety,
reliability, and sustainability. However, large cost investments currently
inhibit the deployment of these advanced reactor concepts. Digital twins bridge
real-world systems with digital tools to reduce costs, enhance decision-making,
and boost operational efficiency. In this work, a digital twin framework is
designed to operate the Gen-IV Fluoride-salt-cooled High-temperature Reactor,
utilizing data-enhanced methods to optimize operational and maintenance
policies while adhering to system constraints. The closed-loop framework
integrates surrogate modeling, reinforcement learning, and Bayesian inference
to streamline end-to-end communication for online regulation and
self-adjustment. Reinforcement learning is used to consider component health
and degradation to drive the target power generations, with constraints
enforced through a Reference Governor control algorithm that ensures compliance
with pump flow rate and temperature limits. These input driving modules benefit
from detailed online simulations that are assimilated to measurement data with
Bayesian filtering. The digital twin is demonstrated in three case studies: a
one-year long-term operational period showcasing maintenance planning
capabilities, short-term accuracy refinement with high-frequency measurements,
and system shock capturing that demonstrates real-time recalibration
capabilities when change in boundary conditions. These demonstrations validate
robustness for health-aware and constraint-informed nuclear plant operation,
with general applicability to other advanced reactor concepts and complex
engineering systems.

Motivation: 随着光伏和储能在家庭中的普及，需要优化系统运行以减少对主电网的依赖，同时最大化自消费和自给率。

Result: 结果表明，自消费与自给率的比值是确定PV-BESS系统最优容量的有效指标。

Conclusion: 该研究为家庭PV-BESS系统的优化运行提供了实用方法，有助于提高光伏发电的本地利用率。

Abstract: High penetration of Photovoltaic (PV) generation and Battery Energy Storage
System (BESS) in individual households increases the demand for solutions to
determine the optimal PV generation power and the capacity of BESS.
Self-consumption and self-sufficiency are essential for optimising the
operation of PV-BESS systems in households, aiming to minimise power import
from and export to the main grid. However, self-consumption and
self-sufficiency are not independent; they share a linear relationship. This
paper demonstrates this relationship and proposes an optimal operating strategy
that considers power generation and consumption profiles to maximise
self-consumption and self-sufficiency in households equipped with a PV-BESS. We
classify self-consumption and self-sufficiency patterns into four categories
based on the ratio of self-sufficiency to self-consumption for each household
and determine the optimal PV generation and BESS capacities using both a
mathematical calculation and this ratio. These optimal operation values for
each category are then simulated using Model Predictive Control (MPC) and
Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based battery charging and discharging scheduling
models. The results show that the ratio between self-consumption and
self-sufficiency is a useful metric for determining the optimal capacity of
PV-BESS systems to maximise the local utilisation of PV-generated power.

Result: 证明了屏蔽机制在全局安全性上的概率界限，并通过案例研究验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为自主代理在感知错误下的安全控制提供了理论保证和实际应用验证。

Abstract: We consider the problem of safe control in discrete autonomous agents that
use learned components for imperfect perception (or more generally, state
estimation) from high-dimensional observations. We propose a shield
construction that provides run-time safety guarantees under perception errors
by restricting the actions available to an agent, modeled as a Markov decision
process, as a function of the state estimates. Our construction uses conformal
prediction for the perception component, which guarantees that for each
observation, the predicted set of estimates includes the actual state with a
user-specified probability. The shield allows an action only if it is allowed
for all the estimates in the predicted set, resulting in a local safety
guarantee. We also articulate and prove a global safety property of existing
shield constructions for perfect-perception agents bounding the probability of
reaching unsafe states if the agent always chooses actions prescribed by the
shield. We illustrate our approach with a case-study of an experimental
autonomous system that guides airplanes on taxiways using high-dimensional
perception DNNs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SOSH的轻量级分布式框架，用于检测和修复多智能体系统中的对抗攻击，保持编队稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统在关键基础设施中的应用增加，但传统共识控制器易受攻击，需要一种更鲁棒的方法。

Method: 提出SOSH框架，通过分布式残差监测检测受损智能体，并用二阶泰勒展开预测替代受攻击状态。

Result: SOSH在实验中表现优于现有方法，具有更快的收敛速度和更低的稳态误差。

Conclusion: SOSH结合理论鲁棒性和实际可部署性，为多智能体系统安全提供了新方向。

Abstract: The increasing deployment of multi-agent systems (MAS) in critical
infrastructures such as autonomous transportation, disaster relief, and smart
cities demands robust formation control mechanisms resilient to adversarial
attacks. Traditional consensus-based controllers, while effective under nominal
conditions, are highly vulnerable to data manipulation, sensor spoofing, and
communication failures. To address this challenge, we propose Second-Order
State Hallucination (SOSH), a novel framework that detects compromised agents
through distributed residual monitoring and maintains formation stability by
replacing attacked states with predictive second-order approximations. Unlike
existing mitigation strategies that require significant restructuring or induce
long transients, SOSH offers a lightweight, decentralized correction mechanism
based on second-order Taylor expansions, enabling rapid and scalable
resilience. We establish rigorous Lyapunov-based stability guarantees, proving
that formation errors remain exponentially bounded even under persistent
attacks, provided the hallucination parameters satisfy explicit conditions.
Comprehensive Monte Carlo experiments on a 5-agent complete graph formation
demonstrate that SOSH outperforms established robust control schemes, including
W-MSR and Huber-based consensus filters, achieving faster convergence rates,
lower steady-state error, and superior transient recovery. Our results confirm
that SOSH combines theoretical robustness with practical deployability,
offering a promising direction for securing MAS formations against
sophisticated adversarial threats.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ROCOF无法完全揭示系统的瞬时行为，因此需要新的指标来补充，以更全面地理解系统可靠性。

Method: 定义了ROCOR（修复率）、ROI（保持率）和TMR（总动态率），并推导了马尔可夫系统中这些指标的显式表达式。

Result: 风电场研究表明，新指标与ROCOF结合使用，能揭示静态指标无法捕捉的动态可靠性特征，区分不同站点的可靠性逻辑。

Conclusion: 新指标为复杂系统的维护调度、操作策略和风险评估提供了时间依赖的视角，提升了管理能力。

Abstract: The Rate of Occurrence of Failures (ROCOF) is a widely utilized indicator for
assessing a system's performance over time, yet it does not fully disclose the
instantaneous behavior of a system. This paper introduces new measures to
complement the ROCOF, providing a more comprehensive understanding of system
reliability, particularly for Markov systems. We define the Rate of Occurrence
of Repairs (ROCOR), which quantifies the system's instantaneous tendency to
transition from failure to working states, and the Rate of Inoccurrence (ROI),
which measures the propensity to remain within the current subset of states
(either working or failure) without transitioning out. Explicit expressions for
the computation of these rates are derived for Markov systems. Furthermore, a
Total Mobility Rate (TMR) is proposed, integrating these individual rates to
capture the overall dynamism of the system. The utility of these new indicators
is demonstrated through a significant real-world application to wind farm
management. The results from the wind farm study show that ROCOR, ROI, and TMR,
when used in conjunction with ROCOF, reveal nuanced operational dynamics and
reliability characteristics that are not discernible from static measures like
Weibull parameters or ROCOF alone. These indicators can distinguish between
sites with similar long-term wind profiles by identifying different
"reliability logics," such as persistence-driven versus transition-driven
behaviors. This enriched, time-dependent perspective provides valuable
information for maintenance scheduling, operational strategies, and risk
assessment, ultimately enhancing the ability to manage complex systems
effectively.

Conclusion: 该研究为AI基础设施的稳定集成奠定了数学基础，预计到2030年AI将占数据中心电力消耗的50-70%。

Abstract: The explosive growth of artificial intelligence has created gigawatt-scale
data centers that fundamentally challenge power system operation, exhibiting
power fluctuations exceeding 500 MW within seconds and millisecond-scale
variations of 50-75% of thermal design power. This paper presents a
comprehensive theoretical framework that reconceptualizes Virtual Power Plants
(VPPs) to accommodate these extreme dynamics through a four-layer hierarchical
control architecture operating across timescales from 100 microseconds to 24
hours.
  We develop control mechanisms and stability criteria specifically tailored to
converter-dominated systems with pulsing megawatt-scale loads. We prove that
traditional VPP architectures, designed for aggregating distributed resources
with response times of seconds to minutes, cannot maintain stability when
confronted with AI data center dynamics exhibiting slew rates exceeding 1,000
MW/s at gigawatt scale.
  Our framework introduces: (1) a sub-millisecond control layer that interfaces
with data center power electronics to actively dampen power oscillations; (2)
new stability criteria incorporating protection system dynamics, demonstrating
that critical clearing times reduce from 150 ms to 83 ms for gigawatt-scale
pulsing loads; and (3) quantified flexibility characterization showing that
workload deferability enables 30% peak reduction while maintaining AI service
availability above 99.95%.
  This work establishes the mathematical foundations necessary for the stable
integration of AI infrastructure that will constitute 50-70% of data center
electricity consumption by 2030.

Abstract: Climate change poses a serious threat to the Earth's ecosystems, fueled
primarily by escalating greenhouse gas emissions. Among the main contributors,
the building sector stands out due to its significant energy demand. Addressing
this challenge requires innovative techniques in the control of energy systems
in buildings. This paper deals with the formulation of a methodology designed
to evaluate the performance of these controllers. The evaluation process
involves the establishment of a comprehensive test protocol and a diverse set
of scenarios to evaluate the controllers. Key performance indicators are used
to quantify their effectiveness based on the test results. A practical case
study is presented as an application to introduce this methodology, focusing on
the integration of Model Predictive Controllers (MPCs) with the Dimosim thermal
simulation platform. The digital twin of the Greener building in Grenoble is
used as a model for emulation. The paper demonstrates the ability of the
proposed methodology to test and rank MPCs in different test scenarios,
providing valuable feedback on their performance capabilities. The paper
highlights the importance of the developed approach in systematically
evaluating and ranking MPCs for optimized building energy management.

Motivation: 现有的PID调优方法（如Ziegler Nichols等）可能无法满足高阶系统的非超调需求，因此需要一种更灵活且性能更优的方法。

Method: 使用约束非线性优化（MATLAB实现）匹配闭环响应到一阶或二阶目标系统，结合IAE最小化和瞬态响应整形。

Result: PID-SRCF性能优于或等同于标准方法，支持高阶系统的非超调解，且灵敏度低。

Conclusion: PID-SRCF可替代传统分析方法，适用于更广泛的系统需求。

Abstract: This paper presents a PID tuning method based on step response curve fitting
(PID-SRCF) that combines integral absolute error (IAE) minimization with
explicit transient response shaping. The proposed approach determines optimal
PID parameters by matching the closed-loop response to any desired system
response, but practically either a first-order plus time delay model or a
second-order system with defined settling time and overshoot requirements.
Implemented using constrained nonlinear optimization in MATLAB, the method has
open-source implementation. Comparative evaluations show the PID-SRCF method
achieves equivalent or better performance over standard tuning approaches, with
capability for non-overshooting solution for higher-order systems which also
provides low sensitivity. The results demonstrate that this approach can
replace known analytical methods like Ziegler Nichols, Lambda Tuning, Pole
Placement and Dominant Pole.

Conclusion: 神经模拟间隙函数为数学模型到现实的控制器设计提供了量化工具和正式保证。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of neural simulation gap functions,
which formally quantifies the gap between the mathematical model and the model
in the high-fidelity simulator, which closely resembles reality. Many times, a
controller designed for a mathematical model does not work in reality because
of the unmodelled gap between the two systems. With the help of this simulation
gap function, one can use existing model-based tools to design controllers for
the mathematical system and formally guarantee a decent transition from the
simulation to the real world. Although in this work, we have quantified this
gap using a neural network, which is trained using a finite number of data
points, we give formal guarantees on the simulation gap function for the entire
state space including the unseen data points. We collect data from
high-fidelity simulators leveraging recent advancements in Real-to-Sim transfer
to ensure close alignment with reality. We demonstrate our results through two
case studies - a Mecanum bot and a Pendulum.

Conclusion: 未来工作将个性化普兰林肽模型并评估更具挑战性的场景。

Abstract: Pramlintide's capability to delay gastric emptying has motivated its use in
artificial pancreas systems, accompanying insulin as a control action. Due to
the scarcity of pramlintide simulation models in the literature, in silico
testing of insulin-plus-pramlintide strategies is not widely used. This work
incorporates a recent pramlintide pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics model into
the T1DM UVA/Padova simulator to adjust and validate four
insulin-plus-pramlintide control algorithms. The proposals are based on an
existing insulin controller and administer pramlintide either as independent
boluses or as a ratio of the insulin infusion. The results of the
insulin-pramlintide algorithms are compared against their insulin-alone
counterparts, showing an improvement in the time in range between 3.00\% and
10.53\%, consistent with results reported in clinical trials in the literature.
Future work will focus on individualizing the pramlintide model to the
patients' characteristics and evaluating the implemented strategies under more
challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: 该方法首次将因果强化学习用于长期风险量化，为含隐变量系统的安全控制提供了有效解决方案，仿真验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Many systems contain latent variables that make their dynamics partially
unidentifiable or cause distribution shifts in the observed statistics between
offline and online data. However, existing control techniques often assume
access to complete dynamics or perfect simulators with fully observable states,
which are necessary to verify whether the system remains within a safe set
(forward invariance) or safe actions are consistently feasible at all times. To
address this limitation, we propose a technique for designing probabilistic
safety certificates for systems with latent variables. A key technical enabler
is the formulation of invariance conditions in probability space, which can be
constructed using observed statistics in the presence of distribution shifts
due to latent variables. We use this invariance condition to construct a safety
certificate that can be implemented efficiently in real-time control. The
proposed safety certificate can continuously find feasible actions that control
long-term risk to stay within tolerance. Stochastic safe control and (causal)
reinforcement learning have been studied in isolation until now. To the best of
our knowledge, the proposed work is the first to use causal reinforcement
learning to quantify long-term risk for the design of safety certificates. This
integration enables safety certificates to efficiently ensure long-term safety
in the presence of latent variables. The effectiveness of the proposed safety
certificate is demonstrated in numerical simulations.

Conclusion: 该方案在复杂疫情下表现出色，为NPIs的实施提供了灵活且有效的框架。

Abstract: This paper presents a scenario-based model predictive control (MPC) scheme
designed to control an evolving pandemic via non-pharmaceutical intervention
(NPIs). The proposed approach combines predictions of possible pandemic
evolution to decide on a level of severity of NPIs to be implemented over
multiple weeks to maintain hospital pressure below a prescribed threshold,
while minimizing their impact on society. Specifically, we first introduce a
compartmental model which divides the population into Susceptible, Infected,
Detected, Threatened, Healed, and Expired (SIDTHE) subpopulations and describe
its positive invariant set. This model is expressive enough to explicitly
capture the fraction of hospitalized individuals while preserving parameter
identifiability w.r.t. publicly available datasets. Second, we devise a
scenario-based MPC scheme with recourse actions that captures potential
uncertainty of the model parameters. e.g., due to population behavior or
seasonality. Our results show that the scenario-based nature of the proposed
controller manages to adequately respond to all scenarios, keeping the hospital
pressure at bay also in very challenging situations when conventional MPC
methods fail.

Abstract: We adopt an operator-theoretic perspective to analyze a class of nonlinear
fixed-point iterations and discrete-time dynamical systems. Specifically, we
study the Krasnoselskij iteration - at the heart of countless algorithmic
schemes and underpinning the stability analysis of numerous dynamical models -
by focusing on a non-Euclidean vector space equipped with the diagonally
weighted supremum norm. By extending the state of the art, we introduce the
notion of enriched weak contractivity, which (i) is characterized by a simple,
verifiable condition for Lipschitz operators, and (ii) yields explicit bounds
on the admissible step size for the Krasnoselskij iteration. Our results relate
the notion of weak contractivity with that of monotonicity of operators and
dynamical systems and show its generality to design larger step sizes and
improved convergence speed for broader classes of dynamical systems. The newly
developed theory is illustrated on two applications: the design of zero-finding
algorithms for monotone operators and the design of nonlinear consensus
dynamics in monotone multi-agent dynamical systems.

Motivation: 现有GIS系统难以整合大规模、多样化时空数据，需高效统一的编码管理方案。

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid development of remote sensing, Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles, and IoT technologies has led to an explosive growth in
spatio-temporal forest and grassland data, which are increasingly multimodal,
heterogeneous, and subject to continuous updates. However, existing Geographic
Information Systems (GIS)-based systems struggle to integrate and manage of
such large-scale and diverse data sources. To address these challenges, this
paper proposes G-SEED (GeoSOT-based Scalable Encoding and Extraction for Forest
and Grassland Spatio-temporal Data), a unified encoding and management
framework based on the hierarchical GeoSOT (Geographical coordinate global
Subdivision grid with One dimension integer on 2n tree) grid system. G-SEED
integrates spatial, temporal, and type information into a composite code,
enabling consistent encoding of both structured and unstructured data,
including remote sensing imagery, vector maps, sensor records, documents, and
multimedia content. The framework incorporates adaptive grid-level selection,
center-cell-based indexing, and full-coverage grid arrays to optimize spatial
querying and compression. Through extensive experiments on a real-world dataset
from Shennongjia National Park (China), G-SEED demonstrates superior
performance in spatial precision control, cross-source consistency, query
efficiency, and compression compared to mainstream methods such as Geohash and
H3. This study provides a scalable and reusable paradigm for the unified
organization of forest and grassland big data, supporting dynamic monitoring
and intelligent decision-making in these domains.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了Lyapunov函数合成的效率和适用范围，为稳定性分析提供了新工具。

Abstract: We investigate the formal synthesis of global polynomial Lyapunov functions
for polynomial vector fields. We establish that a sign-definite polynomial must
satisfy specific algebraic constraints, which we leverage to develop a set of
straightforward symbolic reduction rules. These rules can be recursively
applied to symbolically simplify the Lyapunov candidate, enabling more
efficient and robust discovery of Lyapunov functions via optimization or
satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solving. In many cases, without such
simplification, finding a valid Lyapunov function is often infeasible. When
strict Lyapunov functions are unavailable, we design synthesis procedures for
finding weak Lyapunov functions to verify global asymptotic stability using
LaSalle's invariance principle. Finally, we encode instability conditions for
Lyapunov functions and develop SMT procedures to disprove global asymptotic
stability. Through a series of examples, we demonstrate that the proposed
symbolic reduction, LaSalle-type conditions, and instability tests allow us to
efficiently solve many cases that would otherwise be challenging.

Abstract: Mathematical models are crucial for optimizing and controlling chemical
processes, yet they often face significant limitations in terms of
computational time, algorithm complexity, and development costs. Hybrid models,
which combine mechanistic models with data-driven models (i.e. models derived
via the application of machine learning to experimental data), have emerged as
a promising solution to these challenges. However, the identification of
dynamic hybrid models remains difficult due to the need to integrate
data-driven models within mechanistic model structures. We present an
incremental identification approach for dynamic hybrid models that decouples
the mechanistic and data-driven components to overcome computational and
conceptual difficulties. Our methodology comprises four key steps: (1)
regularized dynamic parameter estimation to determine optimal time profiles for
flux variables, (2) correlation analysis to evaluate relationships between
variables, (3) data-driven model identification using advanced machine learning
techniques, and (4) hybrid model integration to combine the mechanistic and
data-driven components. This approach facilitates early evaluation of model
structure suitability, accelerates the development of hybrid models, and allows
for independent identification of data-driven components. Three case studies
are presented to illustrate the robustness, reliability, and efficiency of our
incremental approach in handling complex systems and scenarios with limited
data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于物理信息的神经网络框架，用于从微观CAV控制设计直接学习非局部宏观交通流模型，填补了微观与宏观建模的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有宏观模型通常假设局部性，而CAV的动态行为涉及非局部的“前瞻”和“后顾”特性，这一特性在宏观模型中尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过物理信息神经网络框架，从合成的CAV轨迹数据中重构宏观交通状态，并学习嵌入非局部守恒律的交通流模型。

Conclusion: 研究为从通用CAV控制设计直接学习非局部宏观交通流模型提供了系统方法，并揭示了控制参数对非局部核的影响。

Abstract: Connected automated vehicles (CAVs) cruising control strategies have been
extensively studied at the microscopic level. CAV controllers sense and react
to traffic both upstream and downstream, yet most macroscopic models still
assume locality, where the desired speed only depends on local density. The
nonlocal macroscopic traffic flow models that explicitly capture the ``look
ahead'' and ``look behind'' nonlocal CAV dynamics remain underexplored. In this
paper, we propose a Physics-informed Neural Network framework to directly learn
a macroscopic non-local flow model from a generic looking-ahead looking-behind
vehicle motion model, which bridges the micro-macro modeling gap. We
reconstruct macroscopic traffic states from synthetic CAV trajectories
generated by the proposed microscopic control designs, and then learn a
non-local traffic flow model that embeds a non-local conservation law to
capture the resulting look-ahead look-behind dynamics. To analyze how CAV
control parameters affect nonlocal traffic flow, we conduct high-fidelity
driving simulator experiments to collect human drivers' trajectory data with
varying downstream and upstream visibility, which serves as a baseline for
tuning CAV control gains. Our analysis validates that the learned non-local
flow model predicts CAV traffic dynamics more accurately than local models, and
the fundamental diagram exhibits far less scatter in the speed - density
relation. We further show that the looking-ahead/looking-behind control gains
mainly reshape the non-local kernels, while the macroscopic speed and non-local
density relation mainly depends on the desired speed function choice of the CAV
controller. Our results provide a systematic approach for learning non-local
macroscopic traffic-flow models directly from generic CAV control designs.

schemes.

Abstract: In the paper, we formulate the target-pointing consensus problem where the
headings of agents are required to point at a common target. Only a few agents
in the network can measure the bearing information of the target. A two-step
solution consisting of a bearing-only estimator for target localization and a
control law for target pointing is constructed to address this problem.
Compared to the strong assumptions of existing works, we only require two
agents not collinear with the target to ensure localizability. By introducing
the concept of virtual fusion node, we prove that both the estimation error and
the tracking error converge asymptotically to the origin. The video
demonstration of the verification can be found at https://youtu.be/S9-

Abstract: In networked control systems, communication resource constraints often
necessitate the use of \emph{sparse} control input vectors. A prototypical
problem is how to ensure controllability of a linear dynamical system when only
a limited number of actuators (inputs) can be active at each time step. In this
work, we first present an algorithm for determining the \emph{sparse actuator
schedule}, i.e., the sequence of supports of the input vectors that ensures
controllability. Next, we extend the algorithm to minimize the average control
energy by simultaneously minimizing the trace of the controllability Gramian,
under the sparsity constraints. We derive theoretical guarantees for both
algorithms: the first algorithm ensures controllability with a minimal number
of control inputs at a given sparsity level; for the second algorithm, we
derive an upper bound on the average control energy under the resulting
actuator schedule. Finally, we develop a novel sparse controller based on
Kalman filtering and sparse signal recovery that drives the system to a desired
state in the presence of process and measurement noise. We also derive an upper
bound on the steady-state MSE attained by the algorithm. We corroborate our
theoretical results using numerical simulations and illustrate that sparse
control achieves a control performance comparable to the fully actuated
systems.

Conclusion: 模型准确再现了热-水力相互作用和热流，适用于5GDHC系统的仿真，并以开源许可证公开。

Abstract: Fifth generation district heating and cooling (5GDHC) networks accelerate the
use of renewable energies in the heating sector and enable flexible, efficient
and future-proof heating and cooling supply via a single network. Due to their
low temperature level and high integration of renewables, 5GDHC systems pose
new challenges for the modeling of these networks in order to simulate and test
operational strategies. A particular feature is the use of uninsulated pipes,
which allow energy exchange with the surrounding ground. Accurate modeling of
this interaction is essential for reliable simulation and optimization. This
paper presents a thermp-physical model of the pip connections, the surrounding
soil, a latent heat storage in the form of an ice storage as a seasonal heat
storage and the house transfer stations. The model is derived from mass and
energy balances leading to ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Validation
is performed using field date from the 5GDHC network in Gutach-Bleibach,
Germany, which supplies heating and cooling to 30 modern buildings. With an
average model deviation of 4.5 % in the normalized mean bias error (NMBE) and
15.9 % in the coefficient of the variation of the root mean square error
(CVRMSE), the model's accuracy is validated against the available temperature
measurements. The realistic representation of the thermal-hydraulic
interactions between soil and pipes, as well as the heat flow within the
network, confirms the accuracy of the model and its applicability for the
simulation of 5GDHC systems. The model is made openly accessible under an
open-source license.

Abstract: The reliance on distributed renewable energy has increased recently. As a
result, power electronic-based distributed generators replaced synchronous
generators which led to a change in the dynamic characteristics of the
microgrid. Most critically, they reduced system inertia and damping. Virtual
synchronous generators emulated in power electronics, which mimic the dynamic
behaviour of synchronous generators, are meant to fix this problem. However,
fixed virtual synchronous generator parameters cannot guarantee a frequency
regulation within the acceptable tolerance range. Conversely, a dynamic
adjustment of these virtual parameters promises robust solution with stable
frequency. This paper proposes a method to adapt the inertia, damping, and
droop parameters dynamically through a fuzzy neural network controller. This
controller trains itself online to choose appropriate values for these virtual
parameters. The proposed method can be applied to a typical AC microgrid by
considering the penetration and impact of renewable energy sources. We study
the system in a MATLAB/Simulink model and validate it experimentally in real
time using hardware-in-the-loop based on an embedded ARM system (SAM3X8E,
Cortex-M3). Compared to traditional and fuzzy logic controller methods, the
results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces the
frequency deviation to less than 0.03 Hz and shortens the stabilizing/recovery
time.

Abstract: Many countries' policies have shifted rapidly towards using renewable energy
for climate reasons. As a result, inverter-based resources are beginning to
dominate power systems. Key elements for managing the loss of conventional
generators are virtual-synchronous-generator-based grid-forming inverters.
Despite the unique advantages of this technology, there are still various
challenges, most notably the problem of active-reactive power coupling due to a
nonzero power angle and high grid impedance ratio R/X. The effect of power
coupling means that any change in the inverter's active power will affect the
reactive power and vice versa. This challenge results in grid instability,
reduces control performance, and restricts the active power delivery capability
of the inverter to the grid. This paper presents a new vision to solve this
impact in weak grids by a new power-decoupling method based on adaptive virtual
synchronous generator parameters. The power coupling will be studied
considering the parameters causing this effect. Fuzzy logic will serve to
adjust the parameters of power control loops. Hardware-in-the-loop testing on a
real-time simulator (OP4610) and a physical microcontroller verified and
validated the proposed method. The results showed the proposed method's
effectiveness in eliminating static and dynamic power coupling and improving
the grid-forming inverter performance under different operating conditions.

Result: 灵活性提升增加了CCGT-CCS的发电利润和装机容量，但系统成本仅降低0.3-0.5%。

Conclusion: 灵活性改进应在资本和维护成本有限增加的情况下实施。

Abstract: As the share of variable renewable energy in power systems grows, enhancing
the operational flexibility of combined cycle gas turbines with carbon capture
and storage (CCGT-CCS) becomes increasingly valuable. This study integrates
techno-economic analysis with capacity expansion modeling to quantify the value
of improved CCGT-CCS flexibility-such as lower start-up costs, reduced minimum
generation, faster ramping, and shorter up/down times-at both plant and system
levels. Using the Texas power system as a case study, we find that increased
flexibility raises CCGT-CCS generation profits and installed capacity. Under
various policy scenarios, CCGT-CCS benefits most from a CO2 tax (or equivalent
emissions cap), more so than from clean energy standards or capture subsidies
like the federal 45Q tax credit. However, electricity system cost savings
remain modest, reducing total costs by only 0.3-0.5%. Thus, flexibility
improvements should be pursued only if they entail limited increases in capital
and maintenance costs.

Abstract: Accurate measurement of transistor parasitic capacitance and its associated
energy losses is critical for evaluating device performance, particularly in
high-frequency and high-efficiency power conversion systems. This paper
proposes a hybrid single-pulse and Sawyer-Tower test method to analyse
switching characteristics of field-effect transistors (FET), which not only
eliminates overlap losses but also mitigates the effects of current backflow
observed in traditional double-pulse testing. Through a precise loss separation
model, it enables an accurate quantification of switching losses and provides a
refined understanding of device energy dissipation mechanisms. We validate the
hysteresis data and loss separation results through experimental measurements
on a 350-W LLC converter, which further offers deeper insights into transistor
dynamic behaviour and its dependence on operating conditions. This method is
applicable to a wide range of transistors, including emerging SiC and GaN
devices, and serves as a valuable tool for device characterization and
optimization in power electronics.
