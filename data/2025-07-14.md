Abstract: This report presents the CuriosAI team's submission to the EgoExo4D
Proficiency Estimation Challenge at CVPR 2025. We propose two methods for
multi-view skill assessment: (1) a multi-task learning framework using
Sapiens-2B that jointly predicts proficiency and scenario labels (43.6 %
accuracy), and (2) a two-stage pipeline combining zero-shot scenario
recognition with view-specific VideoMAE classifiers (47.8 % accuracy). The
superior performance of the two-stage approach demonstrates the effectiveness
of scenario-conditioned modeling for proficiency estimation.

### [2] [Self-Consistency in Vision-Language Models for Precision Agriculture: Multi-Response Consensus for Crop Disease Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08024)
*Mihir Gupta,Abhay Mangla,Ross Greer,Pratik Desai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合提示专家评估与自一致性机制的农业图像处理框架，显著提升了玉米叶病识别的准确性和治疗建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在农业领域表现不佳，需要一种更可靠的图像分析方法。

Method: 结合提示专家评估协议和余弦一致性自投票机制，优化农业图像分析。

Result: 诊断准确率从82.2%提升至87.8%，症状分析从38.9%提升至52.2%，治疗建议从27.8%提升至43.3%。

Conclusion: 该方法在资源受限环境中具有实际应用潜力，显著提升了农业决策的可靠性。

Abstract: Precision agriculture relies heavily on accurate image analysis for crop
disease identification and treatment recommendation, yet existing
vision-language models (VLMs) often underperform in specialized agricultural
domains. This work presents a domain-aware framework for agricultural image
processing that combines prompt-based expert evaluation with self-consistency
mechanisms to enhance VLM reliability in precision agriculture applications. We
introduce two key innovations: (1) a prompt-based evaluation protocol that
configures a language model as an expert plant pathologist for scalable
assessment of image analysis outputs, and (2) a cosine-consistency self-voting
mechanism that generates multiple candidate responses from agricultural images
and selects the most semantically coherent diagnosis using domain-adapted
embeddings. Applied to maize leaf disease identification from field images
using a fine-tuned PaliGemma model, our approach improves diagnostic accuracy
from 82.2\% to 87.8\%, symptom analysis from 38.9\% to 52.2\%, and treatment
recommendation from 27.8\% to 43.3\% compared to standard greedy decoding. The
system remains compact enough for deployment on mobile devices, supporting
real-time agricultural decision-making in resource-constrained environments.
These results demonstrate significant potential for AI-driven precision
agriculture tools that can operate reliably in diverse field conditions.

### [4] [Towards Evaluating Robustness of Prompt Adherence in Text to Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08039)
*Sujith Vemishetty,Advitiya Arora,Anupama Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种评估文本到图像模型的新框架，重点关注其对提示的遵循能力，并发现现有模型在生成简单二进制图像时表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态LLM和文本到图像模型的研究相对不足，其可靠性和性能评估缺乏系统方法。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 创建新数据集评估模型对输入文本提示的遵循能力，利用GPT-4生成基准描述，并通过比较生成图像与基准描述差异来评估模型。

Result: 模型在生成简单二进制图像时表现不佳，且无法遵循输入数据集的分布。

Conclusion: 现有文本到图像模型在遵循提示和生成特定分布图像方面仍有显著改进空间。

Abstract: The advancements in the domain of LLMs in recent years have surprised many,
showcasing their remarkable capabilities and diverse applications. Their
potential applications in various real-world scenarios have led to significant
research on their reliability and effectiveness. On the other hand, multimodal
LLMs and Text-to-Image models have only recently gained prominence, especially
when compared to text-only LLMs. Their reliability remains constrained due to
insufficient research on assessing their performance and robustness. This paper
aims to establish a comprehensive evaluation framework for Text-to-Image
models, concentrating particularly on their adherence to prompts. We created a
novel dataset that aimed to assess the robustness of these models in generating
images that conform to the specified factors of variation in the input text
prompts. Our evaluation studies present findings on three variants of Stable
Diffusion models: Stable Diffusion 3 Medium, Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, and
Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large Turbo, and two variants of Janus models: Janus Pro
1B and Janus Pro 7B. We introduce a pipeline that leverages text descriptions
generated by the gpt-4o model for our ground-truth images, which are then used
to generate artificial images by passing these descriptions to the
Text-to-Image models. We then pass these generated images again through gpt-4o
using the same system prompt and compare the variation between the two
descriptions. Our results reveal that these models struggle to create simple
binary images with only two factors of variation: a simple geometric shape and
its location. We also show, using pre-trained VAEs on our dataset, that they
fail to generate images that follow our input dataset distribution.

### [5] [Understanding Driving Risks using Large Language Models: Toward Elderly Driver Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08367)
*Yuki Yoshihara,Linjing Jiang,Nihan Karatas,Hitoshi Kanamori,Asuka Harada,Takahiro Tanaka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了多模态大语言模型ChatGPT-4o在交通场景解释中的潜力，重点关注交通密度、交叉口可见性和停车标志识别任务，发现提示设计显著影响性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型在交通场景解释中的应用潜力，尤其是对老年驾驶员评估的支持。

Method: 采用零样本、少样本和多样本提示策略，评估模型性能，以人类标注为参考标准，使用精确率、召回率和F1分数作为指标。

Result: 提示设计显著提升性能，如交叉口可见性召回率从21.7%升至57.0%；模型在停车标志检测中表现出高精确率（86.3%）但召回率较低（76.7%）。

Conclusion: 设计良好的提示下，大语言模型有望成为驾驶风险评估的支持工具，未来需进一步研究扩展性和模型架构优化。

Abstract: This study investigates the potential of a multimodal large language model
(LLM), specifically ChatGPT-4o, to perform human-like interpretations of
traffic scenes using static dashcam images. Herein, we focus on three judgment
tasks relevant to elderly driver assessments: evaluating traffic density,
assessing intersection visibility, and recognizing stop signs recognition.
These tasks require contextual reasoning rather than simple object detection.
Using zero-shot, few-shot, and multi-shot prompting strategies, we evaluated
the performance of the model with human annotations serving as the reference
standard. Evaluation metrics included precision, recall, and F1-score. Results
indicate that prompt design considerably affects performance, with recall for
intersection visibility increasing from 21.7% (zero-shot) to 57.0%
(multi-shot). For traffic density, agreement increased from 53.5% to 67.6%. In
stop-sign detection, the model demonstrated high precision (up to 86.3%) but a
lower recall (approximately 76.7%), indicating a conservative response
tendency. Output stability analysis revealed that humans and the model faced
difficulties interpreting structurally ambiguous scenes. However, the model's
explanatory texts corresponded with its predictions, enhancing
interpretability. These findings suggest that, with well-designed prompts, LLMs
hold promise as supportive tools for scene-level driving risk assessments.
Future studies should explore scalability using larger datasets, diverse
annotators, and next-generation model architectures for elderly driver
assessments.

### [6] [ConsNoTrainLoRA: Data-driven Weight Initialization of Low-rank Adapters using Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08044)
*Debasmit Das,Hyoungwoo Park,Munawar Hayat,Seokeon Choi,Sungrack Yun,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CNTLoRA的数据驱动权重初始化方法，用于改进LoRA微调的收敛性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA权重矩阵随机初始化且固定秩，限制了性能。

Method: 将LoRA初始化视为域偏移问题，通过约束预训练和微调激活关系，得到闭式权重估计，无需训练即可初始化。

Result: 在图像生成、分类和理解任务中，CNTLoRA优于标准和数据驱动初始化方法。

Conclusion: CNTLoRA提供了更快的收敛和更好的性能，设计选择通过分析验证。

Abstract: Foundation models are pre-trained on large-scale datasets and subsequently
fine-tuned on small-scale datasets using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
techniques like low-rank adapters (LoRA). In most previous works, LoRA weight
matrices are randomly initialized with a fixed rank across all attachment
points. In this paper, we improve convergence and final performance of LoRA
fine-tuning, using our proposed data-driven weight initialization method,
ConsNoTrainLoRA (CNTLoRA). We express LoRA initialization as a domain shift
problem where we use multiple constraints relating the pre-training and
fine-tuning activations. By reformulating these constraints, we obtain a
closed-form estimate of LoRA weights that depends on pre-training weights and
fine-tuning activation vectors and hence requires no training during
initialization. This weight estimate is decomposed to initialize the up and
down matrices with proposed flexibility of variable ranks. With the proposed
initialization method, we fine-tune on downstream tasks such as image
generation, image classification and image understanding. Both quantitative and
qualitative results demonstrate that CNTLoRA outperforms standard and
data-driven weight initialization methods. Extensive analyses and ablations
further elucidate the design choices of our framework, providing an optimal
recipe for faster convergence and enhanced performance.

### [7] [A Hybrid Multilayer Extreme Learning Machine for Image Classification with an Application to Quadcopters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08047)
*Rolando A. Hernandez-Hernandez,Adrian Rubio-Solis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于ELM-AE和区间类型2模糊逻辑的混合多层极限学习机（HML-ELM），用于无人机图像分类，表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自然信号（如图像）分类问题，提升无人机在主动分类任务中的效率。

Method: 分两阶段：1）自学习特征提取（堆叠ELM-AE）；2）监督特征分类（使用SIT2-FELM和SC算法）。

Result: 在基准测试和无人机实验中，HML-ELM表现优于ML-ELM、ML-FELM和ELM。

Conclusion: HML-ELM是一种高效的图像分类方法，尤其适用于无人机任务。

Abstract: Multilayer Extreme Learning Machine (ML-ELM) and its variants have proven to
be an effective technique for the classification of different natural signals
such as audio, video, acoustic and images. In this paper, a Hybrid Multilayer
Extreme Learning Machine (HML-ELM) that is based on ELM-based autoencoder
(ELM-AE) and an Interval Type-2 fuzzy Logic theory is suggested for active
image classification and applied to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The
proposed methodology is a hierarchical ELM learning framework that consists of
two main phases: 1) self-taught feature extraction and 2) supervised feature
classification. First, unsupervised multilayer feature encoding is achieved by
stacking a number of ELM-AEs, in which input data is projected into a number of
high-level representations. At the second phase, the final features are
classified using a novel Simplified Interval Type-2 Fuzzy ELM (SIT2-FELM) with
a fast output reduction layer based on the SC algorithm; an improved version of
the algorithm Center of Sets Type Reducer without Sorting Requirement
(COSTRWSR). To validate the efficiency of the HML-ELM, two types of experiments
for the classification of images are suggested. First, the HML-ELM is applied
to solve a number of benchmark problems for image classification. Secondly, a
number of real experiments to the active classification and transport of four
different objects between two predefined locations using a UAV is implemented.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed HML-ELM delivers a superior
efficiency compared to other similar methodologies such as ML-ELM, Multilayer
Fuzzy Extreme Learning Machine (ML-FELM) and ELM.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云和云阴影掩膜是高光谱卫星影像预处理的关键步骤，需高效方法提取高质量数据。

Method: 比较了梯度提升方法（XGBoost、LightGBM）和卷积神经网络（CNN），CNN结合特征降维表现最优。

Result: 所有模型准确率超过93%，轻量级CNN在准确性、存储需求和推理速度上表现最佳。

Conclusion: 轻量级AI模型适用于实时高光谱影像处理，支持星载AI系统开发。

Abstract: Cloud and cloud shadow masking is a crucial preprocessing step in
hyperspectral satellite imaging, enabling the extraction of high-quality,
analysis-ready data. This study evaluates various machine learning approaches,
including gradient boosting methods such as XGBoost and LightGBM as well as
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). All boosting and CNN models achieved
accuracies exceeding 93%. Among the investigated models, the CNN with feature
reduction emerged as the most efficient, offering a balance of high accuracy,
low storage requirements, and rapid inference times on both CPUs and GPUs.
Variations of this version, with only up to 597 trainable parameters,
demonstrated the best trade-off in terms of deployment feasibility, accuracy,
and computational efficiency. These results demonstrate the potential of
lightweight artificial intelligence (AI) models for real-time hyperspectral
image processing, supporting the development of on-board satellite AI systems
for space-based applications.

### [9] [The relative importance of being Gaussian](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08059)
*F. Alberto Grünbaum,Tondgi Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在非高斯噪声下使用扩散模型进行去噪的性能表现，而非修改算法以适应噪声类型。实验在小型设备上进行，验证了算法的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究扩散模型在非高斯噪声（如均匀分布、Beta分布或混合高斯噪声）下的表现，而非针对噪声类型调整算法。

Method: 使用原始扩散模型算法，但将高斯噪声替换为其他类型的噪声（如均匀分布、Beta分布或混合高斯噪声），并在小型设备上进行实验。

Result: 验证了算法在非高斯噪声下的性能表现，展示了其鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 扩散模型在非高斯噪声下仍能表现良好，但进一步研究在不同情境下的表现仍具挑战性。

Abstract: The remarkable results for denoising in computer vision using diffusion
models given in \cite{SDWMG,HJA,HHG} yield a robust mathematical justification
for algorithms based on crucial properties of a sequence of Gaussian
independent $N(0,1)$ random variables. In particular the derivations use the
fact that a Gaussian distribution is determined by its mean and variance and
that the sum of two Gaussians is another Gaussian.
  \bigskip
  The issue raised in this short note is the following: suppose we use the
algorithm without any changes but replace the nature of the noise and use, for
instance, uniformly distributed noise or noise with a Beta distribution, or
noise which is a random superposition of two Gaussians with very different
variances. One could, of course, try to modify the algorithm keeping in mind
the nature of the noise, but this is not what we do. Instead we study the
performance of the algorithm when used with noise that is very far in nature
from the Gaussian case, where it is designed to work well.
  Usually these algorithms are implemented on very powerful computers. Our
experiments are all carried out on a small laptop and for the smallest possible
image size. Exploring how our observations are confirmed or changed when
dealing in different situations remains an interesting challenge.

*Babak Memar,Luigi Russo,Silvia Liberata Ullo,Paolo Gamba*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于深度学习的单幅VHR SAR图像建筑高度自动估算方法，通过边界框检测和高度回归实现，并在多大陆数据集上验证了其泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高精度建筑高度估算对城市应用至关重要，而现有方法在跨城市和跨大陆泛化能力上存在局限。

Method: 采用基于边界框检测的深度学习回归方法，利用多大陆数据集进行训练和交叉验证。

Result: 模型在欧洲城市表现优异（MAE约2.20米），但在亚洲城市因高密度建筑表现稍逊。

Conclusion: 深度学习在单幅VHR SAR图像建筑高度估算中展现出强大的跨城市和跨大陆泛化潜力。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of building heights using very high resolution (VHR)
synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is crucial for various urban
applications. This paper introduces a Deep Learning (DL)-based methodology for
automated building height estimation from single VHR COSMO-SkyMed images: an
object-based regression approach based on bounding box detection followed by
height estimation. This model was trained and evaluated on a unique
multi-continental dataset comprising eight geographically diverse cities across
Europe, North and South America, and Asia, employing a cross-validation
strategy to explicitly assess out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. The
results demonstrate highly promising performance, particularly on European
cities where the model achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of approximately
one building story (2.20 m in Munich), significantly outperforming recent
state-of-the-art methods in similar OOD scenarios. Despite the increased
variability observed when generalizing to cities in other continents,
particularly in Asia with its distinct urban typologies and prevalence of
high-rise structures, this study underscores the significant potential of DL
for robust cross-city and cross-continental transfer learning in building
height estimation from single VHR SAR data.

*Chong Cheng,Yu Hu,Sicheng Yu,Beizhen Zhao,Zijian Wang,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RegGS提出了一种基于3D高斯注册的框架，用于重建未定位的稀疏视图，通过熵正则化的Sinkhorn算法和联合注册模块，实现了高精度的相机姿态估计和场景对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯重建方法在稀疏视图下表现不佳，且前馈方法难以整合更多输入视图。RegGS旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 使用熵正则化的Sinkhorn算法计算最优传输距离，结合光度一致性和深度几何设计联合注册模块，实现从粗到细的注册。

Result: 在RE10K和ACID数据集上，RegGS实现了高保真的局部高斯注册，精确的相机姿态估计和高质量的新视角合成。

Conclusion: RegGS通过全局一致的3D高斯表示，有效解决了稀疏视图重建问题，展现了优越性能。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated its potential in reconstructing
scenes from unposed images. However, optimization-based 3DGS methods struggle
with sparse views due to limited prior knowledge. Meanwhile, feed-forward
Gaussian approaches are constrained by input formats, making it challenging to
incorporate more input views. To address these challenges, we propose RegGS, a
3D Gaussian registration-based framework for reconstructing unposed sparse
views. RegGS aligns local 3D Gaussians generated by a feed-forward network into
a globally consistent 3D Gaussian representation. Technically, we implement an
entropy-regularized Sinkhorn algorithm to efficiently solve the optimal
transport Mixture 2-Wasserstein $(\text{MW}_2)$ distance, which serves as an
alignment metric for Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) in $\mathrm{Sim}(3)$ space.
Furthermore, we design a joint 3DGS registration module that integrates the
$\text{MW}_2$ distance, photometric consistency, and depth geometry. This
enables a coarse-to-fine registration process while accurately estimating
camera poses and aligning the scene. Experiments on the RE10K and ACID datasets
demonstrate that RegGS effectively registers local Gaussians with high
fidelity, achieving precise pose estimation and high-quality novel-view
synthesis. Project page: https://3dagentworld.github.io/reggs/.

*Hyungjun Doh,Dong In Lee,Seunggeun Chi,Pin-Hao Huang,Kwonjoon Lee,Sangpil Kim,Karthik Ramani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种从单目视频重建动态人-物交互的新框架，解决了遮挡和时间不一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D重建方法假设静态物体或动态主体完全可见，导致在遮挡场景中性能下降。

Method: 利用模态补全推断部分遮挡区域的完整结构，结合时间上下文增强视频序列的一致性。

Result: 在挑战性单目视频上验证，显示在处理遮挡和时间稳定性方面优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该框架无需预定义模型，显著提升了动态场景中复杂细节的恢复能力。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for reconstructing dynamic human-object
interactions from monocular video that overcomes challenges associated with
occlusions and temporal inconsistencies. Traditional 3D reconstruction methods
typically assume static objects or full visibility of dynamic subjects, leading
to degraded performance when these assumptions are violated-particularly in
scenarios where mutual occlusions occur. To address this, our framework
leverages amodal completion to infer the complete structure of partially
obscured regions. Unlike conventional approaches that operate on individual
frames, our method integrates temporal context, enforcing coherence across
video sequences to incrementally refine and stabilize reconstructions. This
template-free strategy adapts to varying conditions without relying on
predefined models, significantly enhancing the recovery of intricate details in
dynamic scenes. We validate our approach using 3D Gaussian Splatting on
challenging monocular videos, demonstrating superior precision in handling
occlusions and maintaining temporal stability compared to existing techniques.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We propose Adaptive Diffusion Denoised Smoothing, a method for certifying the
predictions of a vision model against adversarial examples, while adapting to
the input. Our key insight is to reinterpret a guided denoising diffusion model
as a long sequence of adaptive Gaussian Differentially Private (GDP) mechanisms
refining a pure noise sample into an image. We show that these adaptive
mechanisms can be composed through a GDP privacy filter to analyze the
end-to-end robustness of the guided denoising process, yielding a provable
certification that extends the adaptive randomized smoothing analysis. We
demonstrate that our design, under a specific guiding strategy, can improve
both certified accuracy and standard accuracy on ImageNet for an $\ell_2$
threat model.

Result: 系统实现了轻量级实时性能，mAP50为0.801。

Conclusion: 提出的系统能有效帮助视障人士安全通勤，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Visually impaired people face significant challenges in their day-to-day
commutes in the urban cities of Bangladesh due to the vast number of
obstructions on every path. With many injuries taking place through road
accidents on a daily basis, it is paramount for a system to be developed that
can alert the visually impaired of objects at close distance beforehand. To
overcome this issue, a novel alert system is proposed in this research to
assist the visually impaired in commuting through these busy streets without
colliding with any objects. The proposed system can alert the individual to
objects that are present at a close distance. It utilizes transfer learning to
train models for depth estimation and object detection, and combines both
models to introduce a novel system. The models are optimized through the
utilization of quantization techniques to make them lightweight and efficient,
allowing them to be easily deployed on embedded systems. The proposed solution
achieved a lightweight real-time depth estimation and object detection model
with an mAP50 of 0.801.

Motivation: 开发一种能模拟操作系统GUI的神经框架，为未来人机交互系统提供自适应生成界面。

Method: 结合RNN跟踪计算机状态和扩散渲染器生成屏幕图像，训练于Ubuntu XFCE数据集。

Result: 成功渲染逼真GUI序列，准确捕捉鼠标交互和状态转换，但键盘交互建模仍有挑战。

Conclusion: NeuralOS为未来自适应神经界面迈出一步，尽管键盘交互仍需改进。

Abstract: We introduce NeuralOS, a neural framework that simulates graphical user
interfaces (GUIs) of operating systems by directly predicting screen frames in
response to user inputs such as mouse movements, clicks, and keyboard events.
NeuralOS combines a recurrent neural network (RNN), which tracks computer
state, with a diffusion-based neural renderer that generates screen images. The
model is trained on a large-scale dataset of Ubuntu XFCE recordings, which
include both randomly generated interactions and realistic interactions
produced by AI agents. Experiments show that NeuralOS successfully renders
realistic GUI sequences, accurately captures mouse interactions, and reliably
predicts state transitions like application launches. Although modeling
fine-grained keyboard interactions precisely remains challenging, NeuralOS
offers a step toward creating fully adaptive, generative neural interfaces for
future human-computer interaction systems.

Conclusion: HNOSeg-XS是一种分辨率鲁棒、高效且参数极少的医学图像分割模型。

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
transformers are dominant. For CNNs, given the local receptive fields of
convolutional layers, long-range spatial correlations are captured through
consecutive convolutions and pooling. However, as the computational cost and
memory footprint can be prohibitively large, 3D models can only afford fewer
layers than 2D models with reduced receptive fields and abstract levels. For
transformers, although long-range correlations can be captured by multi-head
attention, its quadratic complexity with respect to input size is
computationally demanding. Therefore, either model may require input size
reduction to allow more filters and layers for better segmentation.
Nevertheless, given their discrete nature, models trained with patch-wise
training or image downsampling may produce suboptimal results when applied on
higher resolutions. To address this issue, here we propose the
resolution-robust HNOSeg-XS architecture. We model image segmentation by
learnable partial differential equations through the Fourier neural operator
which has the zero-shot super-resolution property. By replacing the Fourier
transform by the Hartley transform and reformulating the problem in the
frequency domain, we created the HNOSeg-XS model, which is resolution robust,
fast, memory efficient, and extremely parameter efficient. When tested on the
BraTS'23, KiTS'23, and MVSeg'23 datasets with a Tesla V100 GPU, HNOSeg-XS
showed its superior resolution robustness with fewer than 34.7k model
parameters. It also achieved the overall best inference time (< 0.24 s) and
memory efficiency (< 1.8 GiB) compared to the tested CNN and transformer
models.

Motivation: 解决StarDist-3D在实例参数化维度与体素分辨率耦合的问题，并避免上采样时的体素化伪影。

Method: 修改StarDist-3D架构，使用双三次Bézier三角形表示实例表面，实现高分辨率预测。

Result: 在生物医学影像数据中，SurfDist表现优于StarDist-3D，参数化更紧凑。

Conclusion: 可解释的实例表面模型可以与实例成员关系一起有效学习。

Abstract: We present SurfDist, a convolutional neural network architecture for
three-dimensional volumetric instance segmentation. SurfDist enables prediction
of instances represented as closed surfaces composed of smooth parametric
surface patches, specifically bicubic B\'ezier triangles. SurfDist is a
modification of the popular model architecture StarDist-3D which breaks
StarDist-3D's coupling of instance parameterization dimension and instance
voxel resolution, and it produces predictions which may be upsampled to
arbitrarily high resolutions without introduction of voxelization artifacts.
  For datasets with blob-shaped instances, common in biomedical imaging,
SurfDist can outperform StarDist-3D with more compact instance
parameterizations. We detail SurfDist's technical implementation and show one
synthetic and one real-world dataset for which it outperforms StarDist-3D.
These results demonstrate that interpretable instance surface models can be
learned effectively alongside instance membership.

intra-species variation. This paper presents our approach for the FungiCLEF
2025 competition, which focuses on few-shot fine-grained visual categorization

significantly underperform relative to vision-based models. Our final model
outperformed both competition baselines and highlighted the effectiveness of
domain specific pretraining and balanced sampling strategies. Our approach
ranked 35/74 on the private test set in post-completion evaluation, this

Method: PBL包括一个安全的云智能手机应用和新型算法，用于拟合生物力学模型，并在神经外科和运动医学诊所测试其可用性。

Result: PBL的关节角度误差在3度以内，步态指标可靠且对临床差异敏感，与患者报告结果相比更敏感。

Conclusion: PBL为临床提供了一种可扩展、低负担的工具，支持智能手机视频用于生物力学数据采集。

Abstract: The way a person moves is a direct reflection of their neurological and
musculoskeletal health, yet it remains one of the most underutilized vital
signs in clinical practice. Although clinicians visually observe movement
impairments, they lack accessible and validated methods to objectively measure
movement in routine care. This gap prevents wider use of biomechanical
measurements in practice, which could enable more sensitive outcome measures or
earlier identification of impairment. We present our Portable Biomechanics
Laboratory (PBL), which includes a secure, cloud-enabled smartphone app for
data collection and a novel algorithm for fitting biomechanical models to this
data. We extensively validated PBL's biomechanical measures using a large,
clinically representative dataset. Next, we tested the usability and utility of
our system in neurosurgery and sports medicine clinics. We found joint angle
errors within 3 degrees across participants with neurological injury,
lower-limb prosthesis users, pediatric inpatients, and controls. In addition to
being easy to use, gait metrics computed from the PBL showed high reliability
and were sensitive to clinical differences. For example, in individuals
undergoing decompression surgery for cervical myelopathy, the mJOA score is a
common patient-reported outcome measure; we found that PBL gait metrics
correlated with mJOA scores and demonstrated greater responsiveness to surgical
intervention than the patient-reported outcomes. These findings support the use
of handheld smartphone video as a scalable, low-burden tool for capturing
clinically meaningful biomechanical data, offering a promising path toward
accessible monitoring of mobility impairments. We release the first clinically
validated method for measuring whole-body kinematics from handheld smartphone
video at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR分辨率的提升导致散射特性差异增加，影响了目标检测模型的泛化能力，现有领域适应技术存在盲特征适应和不可靠语义传播的问题。

Method: CR-Net结合了结构诱导的层次特征适应（SHFA）和可靠结构邻接对齐（RSAA）模块，实现结构感知的特征适应和可靠的语义对齐。

Result: 实验表明，CR-Net在跨分辨率SAR目标检测中显著提升了性能，达到了最先进的水平。

Conclusion: CR-Net通过保留域内结构和提高判别能力，有效解决了跨分辨率SAR目标检测的挑战。

Abstract: In recent years, continuous improvements in SAR resolution have significantly
benefited applications such as urban monitoring and target detection. However,
the improvement in resolution leads to increased discrepancies in scattering
characteristics, posing challenges to the generalization ability of target
detection models. While domain adaptation technology is a potential solution,
the inevitable discrepancies caused by resolution differences often lead to
blind feature adaptation and unreliable semantic propagation, ultimately
degrading the domain adaptation performance. To address these challenges, this
paper proposes a novel SAR target detection method (termed CR-Net), that
incorporates structure priors and evidential learning theory into the detection
model, enabling reliable domain adaptation for cross-resolution detection. To
be specific, CR-Net integrates Structure-induced Hierarchical Feature
Adaptation (SHFA) and Reliable Structural Adjacency Alignment (RSAA). SHFA
module is introduced to establish structural correlations between targets and
achieve structure-aware feature adaptation, thereby enhancing the
interpretability of the feature adaptation process. Afterwards, the RSAA module
is proposed to enhance reliable semantic alignment, by leveraging the secure
adjacency set to transfer valuable discriminative knowledge from the source
domain to the target domain. This further improves the discriminability of the
detection model in the target domain. Based on experimental results from
different-resolution datasets,the proposed CR-Net significantly enhances
cross-resolution adaptation by preserving intra-domain structures and improving
discriminability. It achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in
cross-resolution SAR target detection.

Conclusion: M2DAO-Talker通过创新的运动解耦和优化策略，显著提升了说话头生成的视觉效果和效率。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head generation holds significant potential for film
production. While existing 3D methods have advanced motion modeling and content
synthesis, they often produce rendering artifacts, such as motion blur,
temporal jitter, and local penetration, due to limitations in representing
stable, fine-grained motion fields. Through systematic analysis, we reformulate
talking head generation into a unified framework comprising three steps: video
preprocessing, motion representation, and rendering reconstruction. This
framework underpins our proposed M2DAO-Talker, which addresses current
limitations via multi-granular motion decoupling and alternating
optimization.Specifically, we devise a novel 2D portrait preprocessing pipeline
to extract frame-wise deformation control conditions (motion region
segmentation masks, and camera parameters) to facilitate motion representation.
To ameliorate motion modeling, we elaborate a multi-granular motion decoupling
strategy, which independently models non-rigid (oral and facial) and rigid
(head) motions for improved reconstruction accuracy.Meanwhile, a motion
consistency constraint is developed to ensure head-torso kinematic consistency,
thereby mitigating penetration artifacts caused by motion aliasing. In
addition, an alternating optimization strategy is designed to iteratively
refine facial and oral motion parameters, enabling more realistic video
generation.Experiments across multiple datasets show that M2DAO-Talker achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with the 2.43 dB PSNR improvement in generation
quality and 0.64 gain in user-evaluated video realness versus TalkingGaussian
while with 150 FPS inference speed. Our project homepage is

Conclusion: 该方法为颅骨X射线图像到面部图像的跨域识别提供了一种有效解决方案。

Abstract: Craniofacial reconstruction in forensic science is crucial for the
identification of the victims of crimes and disasters. The objective is to map
a given skull to its corresponding face in a corpus of faces with known
identities using recent advancements in computer vision, such as deep learning.
In this paper, we presented a framework for the identification of a person
given the X-ray image of a skull using convolutional Siamese networks for
cross-domain identity representation. Siamese networks are twin networks that
share the same architecture and can be trained to discover a feature space
where nearby observations that are similar are grouped and dissimilar
observations are moved apart. To do this, the network is exposed to two sets of
comparable and different data. The Euclidean distance is then minimized between
similar pairs and maximized between dissimilar ones. Since getting pairs of
skull and face images are difficult, we prepared our own dataset of 40
volunteers whose front and side skull X-ray images and optical face images were
collected. Experiments were conducted on the collected cross-domain dataset to
train and validate the Siamese networks. The experimental results provide
satisfactory results on the identification of a person from the given skull.

<details>

Motivation: 深度学习在医学图像分析中取得进展，但模型大且不透明限制了临床应用。

Method: 通过选择性保留每层最相关部分，实现针对性压缩，保留临床有意义的表示。

Result: 在多个医学图像分类基准上实现高压缩率且精度损失最小。

Conclusion: 为医疗场景中轻量级、可解释模型的部署铺平道路。

Abstract: Deep learning has driven significant advances in medical image analysis, yet
its adoption in clinical practice remains constrained by the large size and
lack of transparency in modern models. Advances in interpretability techniques
such as DL-Backtrace, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, and Integrated
Gradients make it possible to assess the contribution of individual components
within neural networks trained on medical imaging tasks. In this work, we
introduce an interpretability-guided pruning framework that reduces model
complexity while preserving both predictive performance and transparency. By
selectively retaining only the most relevant parts of each layer, our method
enables targeted compression that maintains clinically meaningful
representations. Experiments across multiple medical image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that this approach achieves high compression rates with
minimal loss in accuracy, paving the way for lightweight, interpretable models
suited for real-world deployment in healthcare settings.

Result: 在CelebA-HQ数据集上，CoCo-Bot提升了概念级可控性和可解释性，同时保持视觉质量。

Conclusion: CoCo-Bot通过显式概念传递信息，解决了传统模型的局限性。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide interpretable and controllable
generative modeling by routing generation through explicit,
human-understandable concepts. However, previous generative CBMs often rely on
auxiliary visual cues at the bottleneck to compensate for information not
captured by the concepts, which undermines interpretability and
compositionality. We propose CoCo-Bot, a post-hoc, composable concept
bottleneck generative model that eliminates the need for auxiliary cues by
transmitting all information solely through explicit concepts. Guided by
diffusion-based energy functions, CoCo-Bot supports robust post-hoc
interventions-such as concept composition and negation-across arbitrary
concepts. Experiments using StyleGAN2 pre-trained on CelebA-HQ show that
CoCo-Bot improves concept-level controllability and interpretability, while
maintaining competitive visual quality.

Abstract: Deep learning has shown remarkable performance in integrating multimodal data
for survival prediction. However, existing multimodal methods mainly focus on
single cancer types and overlook the challenge of generalization across
cancers. In this work, we are the first to reveal that multimodal prognosis
models often generalize worse than unimodal ones in cross-cancer scenarios,
despite the critical need for such robustness in clinical practice. To address
this, we propose a new task: Cross-Cancer Single Domain Generalization for
Multimodal Prognosis, which evaluates whether models trained on a single cancer
type can generalize to unseen cancers. We identify two key challenges: degraded
features from weaker modalities and ineffective multimodal integration. To
tackle these, we introduce two plug-and-play modules: Sparse Dirac Information
Rebalancer (SDIR) and Cancer-aware Distribution Entanglement (CADE). SDIR
mitigates the dominance of strong features by applying Bernoulli-based
sparsification and Dirac-inspired stabilization to enhance weaker modality
signals. CADE, designed to synthesize the target domain distribution, fuses
local morphological cues and global gene expression in latent space.
Experiments on a four-cancer-type benchmark demonstrate superior
generalization, laying the foundation for practical, robust cross-cancer
multimodal prognosis. Code is available at

Conclusion: MRAG通过多范围表示和对抗性扰动，显著提升隐写图像的隐蔽性和恢复能力。

Abstract: Deep hiding has been exploring the hiding capability of deep learning-based
models, aiming to conceal image-level messages into cover images and reveal
them from generated stego images. Existing schemes are easily detected by
steganalyzers due to their large payloads and their limitation to feature
extraction based solely on either pure convolution or pure transformer
operators within a single range, as well as pixel-level loss constraints. To
address the issue, in this paper, we introduce generation-based adversarial
attacks into color JPEG image deep hiding and propose a multi-range
representations-driven adversarial stego generation framework called MRAG from
a steganalysis perspective. Specifically, we integrate the local-range neighbor
reception characteristic of the convolution and the global-range dependency
modeling of the transformer to construct MRAG. Meanwhile, we use the
transformed images obtained through coarse-grained and fine-grained frequency
decomposition as inputs, introducing multi-grained information. Furthermore, a
features angle-norm disentanglement loss is designed to constrain the generated
stegos closer to covers in the angle and norm space of the steganalyzer's
classified features. Consequently, small yet effective adversarial
perturbations can be injected into the process of generating stegos, ensuring
that stegos maintain favorable secret restorability and imperceptibility.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRAG can achieve state-of-the-art
performance.

TL;DR: 提出Cycle Context Verification (CCV)框架，通过自验证预测和增强上下文对齐，提升基于ICL的医学图像分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICL在医学图像分割中表现敏感于查询图像与上下文图像-掩码对的对齐，且临床场景中标注数据稀缺，难以选择最优上下文对。

Method: CCV采用循环流程，首先生成分割掩码，随后交换查询与上下文角色进行验证，并通过查询特定提示优化对齐。

Result: 在七个数据集上验证，CCV优于现有方法，显著提升ICL分割性能。

Conclusion: CCV是一种鲁棒的通用医学图像分割解决方案。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is emerging as a promising technique for achieving
universal medical image segmentation, where a variety of objects of interest
across imaging modalities can be segmented using a single model. Nevertheless,
its performance is highly sensitive to the alignment between the query image
and in-context image-mask pairs. In a clinical scenario, the scarcity of
annotated medical images makes it challenging to select optimal in-context
pairs, and fine-tuning foundation ICL models on contextual data is infeasible
due to computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address
this challenge, we propose Cycle Context Verification (CCV), a novel framework
that enhances ICL-based medical image segmentation by enabling
self-verification of predictions and accordingly enhancing contextual
alignment. Specifically, CCV employs a cyclic pipeline in which the model
initially generates a segmentation mask for the query image. Subsequently, the
roles of the query and an in-context pair are swapped, allowing the model to
validate its prediction by predicting the mask of the original in-context
image. The accuracy of this secondary prediction serves as an implicit measure
of the initial query segmentation. A query-specific prompt is introduced to
alter the query image and updated to improve the measure, thereby enhancing the
alignment between the query and in-context pairs. We evaluated CCV on seven
medical image segmentation datasets using two ICL foundation models,
demonstrating its superiority over existing methods. Our results highlight
CCV's ability to enhance ICL-based segmentation, making it a robust solution
for universal medical image segmentation. The code will be available at

Abstract: Low-level enhancement and high-level visual understanding in low-light vision
have traditionally been treated separately. Low-light enhancement improves
image quality for downstream tasks, but existing methods rely on physical or
geometric priors, limiting generalization. Evaluation mainly focuses on visual
quality rather than downstream performance. Low-light visual understanding,
constrained by scarce labeled data, primarily uses task-specific domain
adaptation, which lacks scalability. To address these challenges, we build a
generalized bridge between low-light enhancement and low-light understanding,
which we term Generalized Enhancement For Understanding (GEFU). This paradigm
improves both generalization and scalability. To address the diverse causes of
low-light degradation, we leverage pretrained generative diffusion models to
optimize images, achieving zero-shot generalization performance. Building on
this, we propose Semantically Consistent Unsupervised Fine-tuning (SCUF).
Specifically, to overcome text prompt limitations, we introduce an
illumination-aware image prompt to explicitly guide image generation and
propose a cycle-attention adapter to maximize its semantic potential. To
mitigate semantic degradation in unsupervised training, we propose caption and
reflectance consistency to learn high-level semantics and image-level spatial
semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in traditional image quality and
GEFU tasks including classification, detection, and semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Real-world applications of computer vision in the humanities require
algorithms to be robust against artistic abstraction, peripheral objects, and
subtle differences between fine-grained target classes. Existing datasets
provide instance-level annotations on artworks but are generally biased towards
the image centre and limited with regard to detailed object classes. The
proposed ODOR dataset fills this gap, offering 38,116 object-level annotations
across 4712 images, spanning an extensive set of 139 fine-grained categories.
Conducting a statistical analysis, we showcase challenging dataset properties,
such as a detailed set of categories, dense and overlapping objects, and
spatial distribution over the whole image canvas. Furthermore, we provide an
extensive baseline analysis for object detection models and highlight the
challenging properties of the dataset through a set of secondary studies.
Inspiring further research on artwork object detection and broader visual
cultural heritage studies, the dataset challenges researchers to explore the
intersection of object recognition and smell perception.

TL;DR: CoDi框架通过两阶段策略（IT和IR）实现主题一致且姿态多样的文本生成图像，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有主题一致生成方法在保持多样性和布局上的不足。

Method: 采用两阶段策略：Identity Transport（IT）和Identity Refinement（IR），分别处理早期和后期去噪步骤。

Result: 在主题一致性、姿态多样性和提示保真度上表现优异。

Conclusion: CoDi在视觉感知和性能上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Subject-consistent generation (SCG)-aiming to maintain a consistent subject
identity across diverse scenes-remains a challenge for text-to-image (T2I)
models. Existing training-free SCG methods often achieve consistency at the
cost of layout and pose diversity, hindering expressive visual storytelling. To
address the limitation, we propose subject-Consistent and pose-Diverse T2I
framework, dubbed as CoDi, that enables consistent subject generation with
diverse pose and layout. Motivated by the progressive nature of diffusion,
where coarse structures emerge early and fine details are refined later, CoDi
adopts a two-stage strategy: Identity Transport (IT) and Identity Refinement
(IR). IT operates in the early denoising steps, using optimal transport to
transfer identity features to each target image in a pose-aware manner. This
promotes subject consistency while preserving pose diversity. IR is applied in
the later denoising steps, selecting the most salient identity features to
further refine subject details. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results
on subject consistency, pose diversity, and prompt fidelity demonstrate that
CoDi achieves both better visual perception and stronger performance across all
metrics. The code is provided in https://github.com/NJU-PCALab/CoDi.

TL;DR: PanMatch是一个通用的基础模型，用于鲁棒的对应匹配，通过统一的2D位移估计框架支持多任务，无需任务特定架构或微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要任务特定架构和领域微调，PanMatch旨在通过统一框架实现多任务集成，提高泛化能力。

Method: 提出基于2D位移估计的统一框架，利用大型视觉模型的特征提取器和跨领域数据集预训练。

Result: PanMatch在跨任务评估中优于UniMatch和Flow-Anything，在异常场景下表现优异。

Conclusion: PanMatch展示了通用模型在多任务和异常场景中的潜力，为鲁棒匹配提供了新方向。

Abstract: This work presents PanMatch, a versatile foundation model for robust
correspondence matching. Unlike previous methods that rely on task-specific
architectures and domain-specific fine-tuning to support tasks like stereo
matching, optical flow or feature matching, our key insight is that any
two-frame correspondence matching task can be addressed within a 2D
displacement estimation framework using the same model weights. Such a
formulation eliminates the need for designing specialized unified architectures
or task-specific ensemble models. Instead, it achieves multi-task integration
by endowing displacement estimation algorithms with unprecedented
generalization capabilities. To this end, we highlight the importance of a
robust feature extractor applicable across multiple domains and tasks, and
propose the feature transformation pipeline that leverage all-purpose features
from Large Vision Models to endow matching baselines with zero-shot cross-view
matching capabilities. Furthermore, we assemble a cross-domain dataset with
near 1.8 million samples from stereo matching, optical flow, and feature
matching domains to pretrain PanMatch. We demonstrate the versatility of
PanMatch across a wide range of domains and downstream tasks using the same
model weights. Our model outperforms UniMatch and Flow-Anything on cross-task
evaluations, and achieves comparable performance to most state-of-the-art
task-specific algorithms on task-oriented benchmarks. Additionally, PanMatch
presents unprecedented zero-shot performance in abnormal scenarios, such as
rainy day and satellite imagery, where most existing robust algorithms fail to
yield meaningful results.

Motivation: 现有方法通过数据无关算法生成哈希中心，忽略了类间语义关系，可能降低检索性能。

Method: 1. 使用分类网络识别类间语义相似性；2. 优化算法生成语义哈希中心；3. 训练深度哈希网络生成二进制哈希码。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上，SHC在MAP@100、MAP@1000和MAP@ALL指标上分别平均提升了7.26%、7.62%和11.71%。

Conclusion: SHC通过语义哈希中心有效保留了语义结构，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Deep hashing is an effective approach for large-scale image retrieval.
Current methods are typically classified by their supervision types:
point-wise, pair-wise, and list-wise. Recent point-wise techniques (e.g., CSQ,
MDS) have improved retrieval performance by pre-assigning a hash center to each
class, enhancing the discriminability of hash codes across various datasets.
However, these methods rely on data-independent algorithms to generate hash
centers, which neglect the semantic relationships between classes and may
degrade retrieval performance.
  This paper introduces the concept of semantic hash centers, building on the
idea of traditional hash centers. We hypothesize that hash centers of
semantically related classes should have closer Hamming distances, while those
of unrelated classes should be more distant. To this end, we propose a
three-stage framework, SHC, to generate hash codes that preserve semantic
structure.
  First, we develop a classification network to identify semantic similarities
between classes using a data-dependent similarity calculation that adapts to
varying data distributions. Second, we introduce an optimization algorithm to
generate semantic hash centers, preserving semantic relatedness while enforcing
a minimum distance between centers to avoid excessively similar hash codes.
Finally, a deep hashing network is trained using these semantic centers to
convert images into binary hash codes.
  Experimental results on large-scale retrieval tasks across several public
datasets show that SHC significantly improves retrieval performance.
Specifically, SHC achieves average improvements of +7.26%, +7.62%, and +11.71%
in MAP@100, MAP@1000, and MAP@ALL metrics, respectively, over state-of-the-art
methods.

TL;DR: MuGCP提出了一种多模态条件提示学习范式，通过生成语义和视觉条件提示，结合注意力互导模块和多提示融合机制，显著提升了视觉语言模型在下游任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决提示学习中类嵌入分布建模不足和跨模态对齐局限于输出层的问题，以提升模型在新类别上的泛化能力和多模态空间的一致性。

Method: 利用多模态大语言模型生成语义条件提示（SCP），引入注意力互导模块（AMG）生成视觉条件提示（VCP），并通过多提示融合（MPF）机制整合提示。

Result: 在14个数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MuGCP通过条件提示生成和多模态交互，显著提升了视觉语言模型的性能，为多模态任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Prompt learning facilitates the efficient adaptation of Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) to various downstream tasks. However, it faces two significant
challenges: (1) inadequate modeling of class embedding distributions for unseen
instances, leading to suboptimal generalization on novel classes; (2)
prevailing methodologies predominantly confine cross-modal alignment to the
final output layer of vision and text encoders, which fundamentally limits
their capacity to preserve topological consistency with pre-trained multi-modal
embedding spaces. To this end, we introduce MuGCP (Multi-modal Mutual-Guidance
Conditional Prompt Learning), a novel paradigm designed for conditional prompt
generation. MuGCP leverages Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as
conditional prompt learners to adaptively generate Semantic Conditional Prompts
(SCP) that incorporate rich, fine-grained high-level semantic knowledge for
image instances. To ensure effective alignment and interaction across the
multi-modal space of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we introduce the Attention
Mutual-Guidance (AMG) module, which facilitates interactions between visual and
semantic information. Through mutual guidance, the AMG module generates Visual
Conditional Prompts (VCP), enhancing the model's performance in multi-modal
tasks. Additionally, we present a Multi-Prompt Fusion (MPF) mechanism that
integrates SCP and VCP with contextual prompts, ensuring seamless coordination
among the different prompts and enhancing the modeling of class embeddings and
instance-specific knowledge. Our MuGCP outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods on 14 different datasets. The code will be made available after
publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能自然识别并补全遮挡物体，但机器人难以实现类似能力。现有技术将场景视为整体，无法从部分观察中识别完整对象。

Method: 开发了空间对比学习技术，通过追踪实例在多视角中的光栅化来增强语义监督；引入原位生成技术，利用观测和几何线索指导3D生成模型完成对象重建。

Result: 在复杂真实和合成场景中，方法在场景分解和对象补全方面表现出色，实现了高分解精度和几何忠实、视觉完整的对象重建。

Conclusion: InstaScene为复杂场景的3D感知提供了新范式，显著提升了分解和补全能力。

Abstract: Humans can naturally identify and mentally complete occluded objects in
cluttered environments. However, imparting similar cognitive ability to
robotics remains challenging even with advanced reconstruction techniques,
which models scenes as undifferentiated wholes and fails to recognize complete
object from partial observations. In this paper, we propose InstaScene, a new
paradigm towards holistic 3D perception of complex scenes with a primary goal:
decomposing arbitrary instances while ensuring complete reconstruction. To
achieve precise decomposition, we develop a novel spatial contrastive learning
by tracing rasterization of each instance across views, significantly enhancing
semantic supervision in cluttered scenes. To overcome incompleteness from
limited observations, we introduce in-situ generation that harnesses valuable
observations and geometric cues, effectively guiding 3D generative models to
reconstruct complete instances that seamlessly align with the real world.
Experiments on scene decomposition and object completion across complex
real-world and synthetic scenes demonstrate that our method achieves superior
decomposition accuracy while producing geometrically faithful and visually
intact objects.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的空间维度加速框架RALU，通过混合分辨率采样和噪声时间重调度，显著减少计算量，同时保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器虽然在高保真图像和视频生成中表现出色，但计算量巨大，阻碍了实际应用。现有方法主要优化时间维度，空间维度仍有加速潜力。

Method: RALU框架分为三个阶段：低分辨率去噪、区域自适应上采样和全分辨率细节细化，结合噪声时间重调度稳定生成。

Result: 在FLUX和Stable Diffusion 3上分别实现了7.0倍和3.0倍的加速，且图像质量几乎无损。

Conclusion: RALU是一种高效的空间维度加速方法，可与现有时间维度加速技术互补，进一步降低推理延迟。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers have emerged as an alternative to U-net-based
diffusion models for high-fidelity image and video generation, offering
superior scalability. However, their heavy computation remains a major obstacle
to real-world deployment. Existing acceleration methods primarily exploit the
temporal dimension such as reusing cached features across diffusion timesteps.
Here, we propose Region-Adaptive Latent Upsampling (RALU), a training-free
framework that accelerates inference along spatial dimension. RALU performs
mixed-resolution sampling across three stages: 1) low-resolution denoising
latent diffusion to efficiently capture global semantic structure, 2)
region-adaptive upsampling on specific regions prone to artifacts at
full-resolution, and 3) all latent upsampling at full-resolution for detail
refinement. To stabilize generations across resolution transitions, we leverage
noise-timestep rescheduling to adapt the noise level across varying
resolutions. Our method significantly reduces computation while preserving
image quality by achieving up to 7.0$\times$ speed-up on FLUX and 3.0$\times$
on Stable Diffusion 3 with minimal degradation. Furthermore, RALU is
complementary to existing temporal accelerations such as caching methods, thus
can be seamlessly integrated to further reduce inference latency without
compromising generation quality.

Result: 提升了修复场景的几何保真度和外观一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂场景中实现了更真实且一致的修复效果。

Abstract: Radiance field methods, such as Neural Radiance Field or 3D Gaussian
Splatting, have emerged as seminal 3D representations for synthesizing
realistic novel views. For practical applications, there is ongoing research on
flexible scene editing techniques, among which object removal is a
representative task. However, removing objects exposes occluded regions, often
leading to unnatural appearances. Thus, studies have employed image inpainting
techniques to replace such regions with plausible content - a task referred to
as 3D scene inpainting. However, image inpainting methods produce one of many
plausible completions for each view, leading to inconsistencies between
viewpoints. A widely adopted approach leverages perceptual cues to blend
inpainted views smoothly. However, it is prone to detail loss and can fail when
there are perceptual inconsistencies across views. In this paper, we propose a
novel 3D scene inpainting method that reliably produces realistic and
perceptually consistent results even for complex scenes by leveraging a
reference view. Given the inpainted reference view, we estimate the inpainting
similarity of the other views to adjust their contribution in constructing an
accurate geometry tailored to the reference. This geometry is then used to warp
the reference inpainting to other views as pseudo-ground truth, guiding the
optimization to match the reference appearance. Comparative evaluation studies
have shown that our approach improves both the geometric fidelity and
appearance consistency of inpainted scenes.

Conclusion: VFMTok在图像分词任务中表现优异，为社区提供了高效工具，代码将公开。

Abstract: Leveraging the powerful representations of pre-trained vision foundation
models -- traditionally used for visual comprehension -- we explore a novel
direction: building an image tokenizer directly atop such models, a largely
underexplored area. Specifically, we employ a frozen vision foundation model as
the encoder of our tokenizer. To enhance its effectiveness, we introduce two
key components: (1) a region-adaptive quantization framework that reduces
redundancy in the pre-trained features on regular 2D grids, and (2) a semantic
reconstruction objective that aligns the tokenizer's outputs with the
foundation model's representations to preserve semantic fidelity. Based on
these designs, our proposed image tokenizer, VFMTok, achieves substantial
improvements in image reconstruction and generation quality, while also
enhancing token efficiency. It further boosts autoregressive (AR) generation --
achieving a gFID of 2.07 on ImageNet benchmarks, while accelerating model
convergence by three times, and enabling high-fidelity class-conditional
synthesis without the need for classifier-free guidance (CFG). The code will be
released publicly to benefit the community.

Conclusion: 该技术具有广泛应用前景，但未来需解决模型精度、可扩展性和动态场景处理等挑战。

Abstract: 3D reconstruction, which aims to recover the dense three-dimensional
structure of a scene, is a cornerstone technology for numerous applications,
including augmented/virtual reality, autonomous driving, and robotics. While
traditional pipelines like Structure from Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo
(MVS) achieve high precision through iterative optimization, they are limited
by complex workflows, high computational cost, and poor robustness in
challenging scenarios like texture-less regions. Recently, deep learning has
catalyzed a paradigm shift in 3D reconstruction. A new family of models,
exemplified by DUSt3R, has pioneered a feed-forward approach. These models
employ a unified deep network to jointly infer camera poses and dense geometry
directly from an Unconstrained set of images in a single forward pass. This
survey provides a systematic review of this emerging domain. We begin by
dissecting the technical framework of these feed-forward models, including
their Transformer-based correspondence modeling, joint pose and geometry
regression mechanisms, and strategies for scaling from two-view to multi-view
scenarios. To highlight the disruptive nature of this new paradigm, we contrast
it with both traditional pipelines and earlier learning-based methods like
MVSNet. Furthermore, we provide an overview of relevant datasets and evaluation
metrics. Finally, we discuss the technology's broad application prospects and
identify key future challenges and opportunities, such as model accuracy and
scalability, and handling dynamic scenes.

Motivation: 当前文档识别方法忽视了文档类型特定的结构特性，导致对复杂或不常见文档类型的识别效果不佳。

Method: 提出了一种基于文档内在结构的归纳偏置设计方法，并采用变压器架构进行端到端文档识别。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在单音谱、形状图和简化工程图等复杂记录结构中表现优异，首次成功实现了工程图的端到端转录。

Conclusion: 该方法为设计文档识别系统提供了新思路，并为未来文档基础模型的统一设计提供了指导。

Abstract: Many document types use intrinsic, convention-driven structures that serve to
encode precise and structured information, such as the conventions governing
engineering drawings. However, state-of-the-art approaches treat document
recognition as a mere computer vision problem, neglecting these underlying
document-type-specific structural properties, making them dependent on
sub-optimal heuristic post-processing and rendering many less frequent or more
complicated document types inaccessible to modern document recognition. We
suggest a novel perspective that frames document recognition as a transcription
task from a document to a record. This implies a natural grouping of documents
based on the intrinsic structure inherent in their transcription, where related
document types can be treated (and learned) similarly. We propose a method to
design structure-specific inductive biases for the underlying machine-learned
end-to-end document recognition systems, and a respective base transformer
architecture that we successfully adapt to different structures. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the so-found inductive biases in extensive experiments
with progressively complex record structures from monophonic sheet music, shape
drawings, and simplified engineering drawings. By integrating an inductive bias
for unrestricted graph structures, we train the first-ever successful
end-to-end model to transcribe engineering drawings to their inherently
interlinked information. Our approach is relevant to inform the design of
document recognition systems for document types that are less well understood
than standard OCR, OMR, etc., and serves as a guide to unify the design of
future document foundation models.

Abstract: F3-Net is a foundation model designed to overcome persistent challenges in
clinical medical image segmentation, including reliance on complete multimodal
inputs, limited generalizability, and narrow task specificity. Through flexible
synthetic modality training, F3-Net maintains robust performance even in the
presence of missing MRI sequences, leveraging a zero-image strategy to
substitute absent modalities without relying on explicit synthesis networks,
thereby enhancing real-world applicability. Its unified architecture supports
multi-pathology segmentation across glioma, metastasis, stroke, and white
matter lesions without retraining, outperforming CNN-based and
transformer-based models that typically require disease-specific fine-tuning.
Evaluated on diverse datasets such as BraTS 2021, BraTS 2024, and ISLES 2022,
F3-Net demonstrates strong resilience to domain shifts and clinical
heterogeneity. On the whole pathology dataset, F3-Net achieves average Dice
Similarity Coefficients (DSCs) of 0.94 for BraTS-GLI 2024, 0.82 for BraTS-MET
2024, 0.94 for BraTS 2021, and 0.79 for ISLES 2022. This positions it as a

Abstract: Document image dewarping remains a challenging task in the deep learning era.
While existing methods have improved by leveraging text line awareness, they
typically focus only on a single horizontal dimension. In this paper, we
propose a fine-grained deformation perception model that focuses on Dual
Dimensions of document horizontal-vertical-lines to improve document Dewarping
called D2Dewarp. It can perceive distortion trends in different directions
across document details. To combine the horizontal and vertical granularity
features, an effective fusion module based on X and Y coordinate is designed to
facilitate interaction and constraint between the two dimensions for feature
complementarity. Due to the lack of annotated line features in current public
dewarping datasets, we also propose an automatic fine-grained annotation method
using public document texture images and an automatic rendering engine to build
a new large-scale distortion training dataset. The code and dataset will be
publicly released. On public Chinese and English benchmarks, both quantitative

### [46] [Occlusion-Guided Feature Purification Learning via Reinforced Knowledge Distillation for Occluded Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08520)
*Yufei Zheng,Wenjun Wang,Wenjun Gan,Jiawei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OGFR通过强化知识蒸馏和遮挡感知特征净化，解决了遮挡行人重识别中的多样遮挡和特征污染问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以处理训练中未见的多样遮挡场景，且易受整体图像特征污染的影响。

Method: 提出OGFR框架，结合遮挡感知视觉Transformer和特征净化模块，通过强化知识蒸馏传递纯净特征。

Result: OGFR能有效学习鲁棒特征，减少遮挡干扰和特征污染。

Conclusion: OGFR为遮挡行人重识别提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Occluded person re-identification aims to retrieve holistic images based on
occluded ones. Existing methods often rely on aligning visible body parts,
applying occlusion augmentation, or complementing missing semantics using
holistic images. However, they face challenges in handling diverse occlusion
scenarios not seen during training and the issue of feature contamination from
holistic images. To address these limitations, we propose Occlusion-Guided
Feature Purification Learning via Reinforced Knowledge Distillation (OGFR),
which simultaneously mitigates these challenges. OGFR adopts a teacher-student
distillation architecture that effectively incorporates diverse occlusion
patterns into feature representation while transferring the purified
discriminative holistic knowledge from the holistic to the occluded branch
through reinforced knowledge distillation. Specifically, an Occlusion-Aware
Vision Transformer is designed to leverage learnable occlusion pattern
embeddings to explicitly model such diverse occlusion types, thereby guiding
occlusion-aware robust feature representation. Moreover, we devise a Feature
Erasing and Purification Module within the holistic branch, in which an agent
is employed to identify low-quality patch tokens of holistic images that
contain noisy negative information via deep reinforcement learning, and
substitute these patch tokens with learnable embedding tokens to avoid feature
contamination and further excavate identity-related discriminative clues.
Afterward, with the assistance of knowledge distillation, the student branch
effectively absorbs the purified holistic knowledge to precisely learn robust
representation regardless of the interference of occlusions.

*Inye Na,Nejung Rue,Jiwon Chung,Hyunjin Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RadiomicsRetrieval是一个基于3D内容的医学图像检索框架，结合手工放射组学特征和深度学习嵌入，支持灵活查询，提升临床决策支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学图像检索方法主要支持2D图像且需要完全标注的查询，限制了临床灵活性。

Method: 提出RadiomicsRetrieval框架，利用可提示分割模型（如SAM）生成肿瘤特异性嵌入，并通过对比学习与放射组学特征对齐，结合解剖位置嵌入（APE）丰富表示。

Result: 在肺CT和脑MRI数据集上验证，放射组学特征显著提升检索特异性，APE为基于位置的搜索提供全局解剖背景。

Conclusion: 该框架仅需最小用户提示（如单点），支持灵活查询，适用于诊断、治疗计划和大规模医学影像研究。

Abstract: Medical image retrieval is a valuable field for supporting clinical
decision-making, yet current methods primarily support 2D images and require
fully annotated queries, limiting clinical flexibility. To address this, we
propose RadiomicsRetrieval, a 3D content-based retrieval framework bridging
handcrafted radiomics descriptors with deep learning-based embeddings at the
tumor level. Unlike existing 2D approaches, RadiomicsRetrieval fully exploits
volumetric data to leverage richer spatial context in medical images. We employ
a promptable segmentation model (e.g., SAM) to derive tumor-specific image
embeddings, which are aligned with radiomics features extracted from the same
tumor via contrastive learning. These representations are further enriched by
anatomical positional embedding (APE). As a result, RadiomicsRetrieval enables
flexible querying based on shape, location, or partial feature sets. Extensive
experiments on both lung CT and brain MRI public datasets demonstrate that
radiomics features significantly enhance retrieval specificity, while APE
provides global anatomical context essential for location-based searches.
Notably, our framework requires only minimal user prompts (e.g., a single
point), minimizing segmentation overhead and supporting diverse clinical
scenarios. The capability to query using either image embeddings or selected
radiomics attributes highlights its adaptability, potentially benefiting
diagnosis, treatment planning, and research on large-scale medical imaging
repositories. Our code is available at

TL;DR: SAM 2在目标分割任务中表现优异，成为视觉目标跟踪的SOTA。通过强化学习优化其内存更新，性能提升显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖手工规则处理干扰、遮挡和运动，限制了性能提升。

Method: 提出基于强化学习的框架，将内存控制建模为序列决策问题。

Result: 在过拟合实验中，性能提升是现有启发式方法的三倍以上。

Conclusion: 强化学习是优化内存控制的有效替代方案，揭示了内存银行的潜力。

Abstract: Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has demonstrated strong performance in
object segmentation tasks and has become the state-of-the-art for visual object
tracking. The model stores information from previous frames in a memory bank,
enabling temporal consistency across video sequences. Recent methods augment
SAM 2 with hand-crafted update rules to better handle distractors, occlusions,
and object motion. We propose a fundamentally different approach using
reinforcement learning for optimizing memory updates in SAM 2 by framing memory
control as a sequential decision-making problem. In an overfitting setup with a
separate agent per video, our method achieves a relative improvement over SAM 2
that exceeds by more than three times the gains of existing heuristics. These
results reveal the untapped potential of the memory bank and highlight
reinforcement learning as a powerful alternative to hand-crafted update rules
for memory control in visual object tracking.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的图像翻译方法DA-KPN，通过轻量级转换函数和多尺度判别器，确保合成标签与翻译图像之间的语义匹配，优于现有GAN方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于真实世界数据标注困难，语义分割依赖合成数据集训练，但现有方法无法保证语义匹配，影响分割性能。

Method: 提出DA-KPN方法，通过像素级输入转换参数估计和多尺度判别器，确保翻译图像的语义一致性。

Result: DA-KPN在合成到真实数据的语义分割任务中表现优于GAN方法，并在人脸解析任务中达到可比性能。

Conclusion: DA-KPN通过轻量级设计和语义匹配保证，为低数据场景下的语义分割提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation relies on many dense pixel-wise annotations to achieve
the best performance, but owing to the difficulty of obtaining accurate
annotations for real world data, practitioners train on large-scale synthetic
datasets. Unpaired image translation is one method used to address the ensuing
domain gap by generating more realistic training data in low-data regimes.
Current methods for unpaired image translation train generative adversarial
networks (GANs) to perform the translation and enforce pixel-level semantic
matching through cycle consistency. These methods do not guarantee that the
semantic matching holds, posing a problem for semantic segmentation where
performance is sensitive to noisy pixel labels. We propose a novel image
translation method, Domain Adversarial Kernel Prediction Network (DA-KPN), that
guarantees semantic matching between the synthetic label and translation.
DA-KPN estimates pixel-wise input transformation parameters of a lightweight
and simple translation function. To ensure the pixel-wise transformation is
realistic, DA-KPN uses multi-scale discriminators to distinguish between
translated and target samples. We show DA-KPN outperforms previous GAN-based
methods on syn2real benchmarks for semantic segmentation with limited access to
real image labels and achieves comparable performance on face parsing.

TL;DR: DISC提出了一种双流范式，通过分离优化增强实例和场景类别的学习，取代体素查询为类别查询，并在SemanticKITTI和SSCBench-KITTI-360上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法以体素为基本交互单元，限制了类别级信息的利用，影响完成结果的粒度。

Method: 提出DISC双流范式，使用类别查询替代体素查询，设计专用解码模块促进类别级信息流动。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI和SSCBench-KITTI-360上分别达到17.35和20.55的mIoU，显著提升实例类别性能。

Conclusion: DISC通过类别级优化显著提升了3D语义场景完成的性能，尤其在实例类别上表现突出。

Abstract: 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has gained increasing attention due to its
pivotal role in 3D perception. Recent advancements have primarily focused on
refining voxel-level features to construct 3D scenes. However, treating voxels
as the basic interaction units inherently limits the utilization of class-level
information, which is proven critical for enhancing the granularity of
completion results. To address this, we propose \textbf{D}isentangling Instance
and Scene Contexts (DISC), a novel dual-stream paradigm that enhances learning
for both instance and scene categories through separated optimization.
Specifically, we replace voxel queries with discriminative class queries, which
incorporate class-specific geometric and semantic priors. Additionally, we
exploit the intrinsic properties of classes to design specialized decoding
modules, facilitating targeted interactions and efficient class-level
information flow. Experimental results demonstrate that DISC achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both SemanticKITTI and
SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks, with mIoU scores of 17.35 and 20.55,
respectively. Remarkably, DISC even outperforms multi-frame SOTA methods using
only single-frame input and significantly improves instance category
performance, surpassing both single-frame and multi-frame SOTA instance mIoU by
17.9\% and 11.9\%, respectively, on the SemanticKITTI hidden test. The code is

Abstract: This study aims to develop a novel multi-modal fusion framework for brain
tumor segmentation that integrates spatial-language-vision information through
bidirectional interactive attention mechanisms to improve segmentation accuracy
and boundary delineation. Methods: We propose two core components: Multi-modal
Semantic Fusion Adapter (MSFA) integrating 3D MRI data with clinical text
descriptions through hierarchical semantic decoupling, and Bidirectional
Interactive Visual-semantic Attention (BIVA) enabling iterative information
exchange between modalities. The framework was evaluated on BraTS 2020 dataset
comprising 369 multi-institutional MRI scans. Results: The proposed method
achieved average Dice coefficient of 0.8505 and 95% Hausdorff distance of
2.8256mm across enhancing tumor, tumor core, and whole tumor regions,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods including SCAU-Net, CA-Net, and 3D
U-Net. Ablation studies confirmed critical contributions of semantic and
spatial modules to boundary precision. Conclusion: Multi-modal semantic fusion
combined with bidirectional interactive attention significantly enhances brain
tumor segmentation performance, establishing new paradigms for integrating
clinical knowledge into medical image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出BayesTTA，一种贝叶斯适应框架，用于解决视觉语言模型在时间演化分布偏移下的性能退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理时间连续的分布偏移时存在缺陷，如有限的内存缓存、不可靠的熵置信度和静态视觉表示。

Method: BayesTTA通过增量估计类条件高斯混合分布、自适应选择协方差结构和校准推理，动态对齐视觉表示。

Result: 在四个时间演化数据集和十个标准TTA数据集上，BayesTTA显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: BayesTTA在时间演化分布偏移下表现出高效稳定的性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot
recognition but degrade significantly under \textit{temporally evolving
distribution shifts} common in real-world scenarios (e.g., gradual illumination
or seasonal changes). Existing continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) methods
are typically built around sudden and severe distribution shifts and neglect
temporal continuity, leading to three core defects: limited memory cache
restricts long-range distribution modeling, causing catastrophic forgetting;
entropy-based confidence becomes unreliable under temporal drift, worsening
error accumulation; and static visual representations misalign with evolving
inputs. We formalize this practical problem as \textit{Continual-Temporal
Test-Time Adaptation (CT-TTA)}, where test distributions evolve gradually over
time. To address it, we propose \textit{BayesTTA}, a Bayesian adaptation
framework that enforces temporally consistent predictions and dynamically
aligns visual representations. Specifically, BayesTTA incrementally estimates
class-conditional Gaussian mixture distributions without storing raw data,
adaptively selects covariance structures through statistical hypothesis
testing, and performs calibrated inference using Gaussian discriminant analysis
(GDA). These calibrated predictions supervise self-paced adaptation of
normalization layers, ensuring efficient and stable representation alignment.
We establish a comprehensive CT-TTA benchmark across four temporally evolving
datasets and further evaluate generalization on ten standard TTA datasets.
Extensive experiments show that BayesTTA consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant gains while maintaining
efficiency. Code is available at

Motivation: 探索如何通过最小化训练数据和标注工作量，高效转录手写文档。

Method: 使用两种标注方法（标准化和外交式）对相同图像数据集进行实验，并微调DAN模型。

Result: 标准化标注适用于可标准化字段（如日期和出生地），而外交式标注更适合不可标准化字段（如姓名）。

Conclusion: 不同标注策略适用于不同类型的字段，需根据字段特性选择合适方法。

Abstract: This study evaluates the recently proposed Document Attention Network (DAN)
for extracting key-value information from Uruguayan birth certificates,
handwritten in Spanish. We investigate two annotation strategies for
automatically transcribing handwritten documents, fine-tuning DAN with minimal
training data and annotation effort. Experiments were conducted on two datasets
containing the same images (201 scans of birth certificates written by more
than 15 different writers) but with different annotation methods. Our findings
indicate that normalized annotation is more effective for fields that can be
standardized, such as dates and places of birth, whereas diplomatic annotation
performs much better for fields containing names and surnames, which can not be
standardized.

TL;DR: OnlineBEV提出了一种基于循环结构的时序3D感知方法，通过MBFNet实现特征对齐，显著提升了多视角相机3D感知性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管时序聚合可以提升3D感知性能，但动态物体运动导致特征变化限制了性能提升，需要一种高效的特征对齐方法。

Method: 提出OnlineBEV，结合循环结构和MBFNet动态对齐时序BEV特征，并使用时序一致性学习损失明确对齐特征。

Result: 在nuScenes测试集上达到63.9% NDS，优于当前最佳方法SOLOFusion。

Conclusion: OnlineBEV通过高效的特征对齐和时序聚合，实现了相机仅3D目标检测任务的领先性能。

Abstract: Multi-view camera-based 3D perception can be conducted using bird's eye view
(BEV) features obtained through perspective view-to-BEV transformations.
Several studies have shown that the performance of these 3D perception methods
can be further enhanced by combining sequential BEV features obtained from
multiple camera frames. However, even after compensating for the ego-motion of
an autonomous agent, the performance gain from temporal aggregation is limited
when combining a large number of image frames. This limitation arises due to
dynamic changes in BEV features over time caused by object motion. In this
paper, we introduce a novel temporal 3D perception method called OnlineBEV,
which combines BEV features over time using a recurrent structure. This
structure increases the effective number of combined features with minimal
memory usage. However, it is critical to spatially align the features over time
to maintain strong performance. OnlineBEV employs the Motion-guided BEV Fusion
Network (MBFNet) to achieve temporal feature alignment. MBFNet extracts motion
features from consecutive BEV frames and dynamically aligns historical BEV
features with current ones using these motion features. To enforce temporal
feature alignment explicitly, we use Temporal Consistency Learning Loss, which
captures discrepancies between historical and target BEV features. Experiments
conducted on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that OnlineBEV achieves
significant performance gains over the current best method, SOLOFusion.
OnlineBEV achieves 63.9% NDS on the nuScenes test set, recording
state-of-the-art performance in the camera-only 3D object detection task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手动收集和标注图像数据集的方法耗时且低效，而生成数据虽提供解决方案，但真实世界数据更具价值。

Method: 利用多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）和图像优化工具包，通过多智能体协作系统自动构建数据集。

Result: 在扩展现有数据集和从头创建新数据集的实验中，DatasetAgent构建的数据集成功用于训练多种视觉模型。

Conclusion: DatasetAgent能够高效、高质量地自动构建真实世界图像数据集，满足用户需求。

Abstract: Common knowledge indicates that the process of constructing image datasets
usually depends on the time-intensive and inefficient method of manual
collection and annotation. Large models offer a solution via data generation.
Nonetheless, real-world data are obviously more valuable comparing to
artificially intelligence generated data, particularly in constructing image
datasets. For this reason, we propose a novel method for auto-constructing
datasets from real-world images by a multiagent collaborative system, named as
DatasetAgent. By coordinating four different agents equipped with Multi-modal
Large Language Models (MLLMs), as well as a tool package for image
optimization, DatasetAgent is able to construct high-quality image datasets
according to user-specified requirements. In particular, two types of
experiments are conducted, including expanding existing datasets and creating
new ones from scratch, on a variety of open-source datasets. In both cases,
multiple image datasets constructed by DatasetAgent are used to train various
vision models for image classification, object detection, and image
segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的模型（7T-Restormer），用于从常规1.5T或3T T1加权图像合成7T质量的T1图，解决了7T MRI成本高和稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 7T MRI具有更高的分辨率和对比度，但成本高且稀缺，同时存在易感性伪影等问题。通过合成7T质量的图像，可以使其更广泛应用于临床。

Method: 使用141例患者数据（1.5T和3T T1加权图像与7T T1图配对），训练并验证了7T-Restormer模型，并与ResViT和ResShift模型进行比较。

Result: 7T-Restormer在1.5T和3T输入下均表现优异，PSNR和SSIM显著优于其他模型，且参数更少。混合训练策略优于单一训练策略。

Conclusion: 该方法能从1.5T和3T T1加权图像高效合成7T质量的T1图，优于现有方法，使7T MRI的优势更易应用于临床。

Abstract: Purpose: Ultra-high-field 7T MRI offers improved resolution and contrast over
standard clinical field strengths (1.5T, 3T). However, 7T scanners are costly,
scarce, and introduce additional challenges such as susceptibility artifacts.
We propose an efficient transformer-based model (7T-Restormer) to synthesize
7T-quality T1-maps from routine 1.5T or 3T T1-weighted (T1W) images. Methods:
Our model was validated on 35 1.5T and 108 3T T1w MRI paired with corresponding
7T T1 maps of patients with confirmed MS. A total of 141 patient cases (32,128
slices) were randomly divided into 105 (25; 80) training cases (19,204 slices),
19 (5; 14) validation cases (3,476 slices), and 17 (5; 14) test cases (3,145
slices) where (X; Y) denotes the patients with 1.5T and 3T T1W scans,
respectively. The synthetic 7T T1 maps were compared against the ResViT and
ResShift models. Results: The 7T-Restormer model achieved a PSNR of 26.0 +/-
4.6 dB, SSIM of 0.861 +/- 0.072, and NMSE of 0.019 +/- 0.011 for 1.5T inputs,
and 25.9 +/- 4.9 dB, and 0.866 +/- 0.077 for 3T inputs, respectively. Using
10.5 M parameters, our model reduced NMSE by 64 % relative to 56.7M parameter
ResShift (0.019 vs 0.052, p = <.001 and by 41 % relative to 70.4M parameter
ResViT (0.019 vs 0.032, p = <.001) at 1.5T, with similar advantages at 3T
(0.021 vs 0.060 and 0.033; p < .001). Training with a mixed 1.5 T + 3 T corpus
was superior to single-field strategies. Restricting the model to 1.5T
increased the 1.5T NMSE from 0.019 to 0.021 (p = 1.1E-3) while training solely
on 3T resulted in lower performance on input 1.5T T1W MRI. Conclusion: We
propose a novel method for predicting quantitative 7T MP2RAGE maps from 1.5T
and 3T T1W scans with higher quality than existing state-of-the-art methods.
Our approach makes the benefits of 7T MRI more accessible to standard clinical
workflows.

TL;DR: ByDeWay是一个无需训练的多模态大语言模型（MLLM）增强框架，通过分层深度提示（LDP）提升空间推理和定位能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM在空间推理和定位方面表现不足，ByDeWay旨在通过深度感知提示策略解决这一问题，无需修改模型参数。

Method: 使用单目深度估计将场景分为近、中、远三层，生成区域特定描述，并将其附加到图像-问题提示中，以提供空间上下文。

Result: 在POPE和GQA基准测试中，ByDeWay显著减少了幻觉并提升了推理能力，且适用于多种MLLM。

Conclusion: ByDeWay证明了深度感知提示在零训练设置下的有效性，为MLLM性能提升提供了轻量级模块化解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce ByDeWay, a training-free framework designed to enhance the
performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). ByDeWay uses a novel
prompting strategy called Layered-Depth-Based Prompting (LDP), which improves
spatial reasoning and grounding without modifying any model parameters. It
segments the scene into closest, mid-range, and farthest layers using monocular
depth estimation, then generates region-specific captions with a grounded
vision-language model. These structured, depth-aware captions are appended to
the image-question prompt, enriching it with spatial context. This guides MLLMs
to produce more grounded and less hallucinated responses. Our method is
lightweight, modular, and compatible with black-box MLLMs. Experiments on
hallucination-sensitive (POPE) and reasoning-intensive (GQA) benchmarks show
consistent improvements across multiple MLLMs, validating the effectiveness of
depth-aware prompting in a zero-training setting.

<details>

Motivation: 地球系统观测（ESO）中多模态卫星图像存在高类间相似性和场景复杂性，现有对比学习框架难以处理多标签对齐和跨模态语义精确性。

Method: 提出MoSAiC框架，结合模态内和模态间对比学习，并引入多标签监督对比损失。

Result: 在BigEarthNet V2.0和Sent12MS数据集上，MoSAiC在低标签和高类重叠场景中优于全监督和自监督基线。

Conclusion: MoSAiC在多模态卫星图像中实现了更精细的语义解耦和鲁棒的表示学习。

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning
transferable representations without the reliance on large labeled datasets.
Its ability to capture intrinsic similarities and differences among data
samples has led to state-of-the-art results in computer vision tasks. These
strengths make CL particularly well-suited for Earth System Observation (ESO),
where diverse satellite modalities such as optical and SAR imagery offer
naturally aligned views of the same geospatial regions. However, ESO presents
unique challenges, including high inter-class similarity, scene clutter, and
ambiguous boundaries, which complicate representation learning -- especially in
low-label, multi-label settings. Existing CL frameworks often focus on
intra-modality self-supervision or lack mechanisms for multi-label alignment
and semantic precision across modalities. In this work, we introduce MoSAiC, a
unified framework that jointly optimizes intra- and inter-modality contrastive
learning with a multi-label supervised contrastive loss. Designed specifically
for multi-modal satellite imagery, MoSAiC enables finer semantic
disentanglement and more robust representation learning across spectrally
similar and spatially complex classes. Experiments on two benchmark datasets,
BigEarthNet V2.0 and Sent12MS, show that MoSAiC consistently outperforms both
fully supervised and self-supervised baselines in terms of accuracy, cluster
coherence, and generalization in low-label and high-class-overlap scenarios.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enables non-invasive, high-resolution
analysis of muscle structures. However, automated segmentation remains limited
by high computational costs, reliance on large training datasets, and reduced
accuracy in segmenting smaller muscles. Convolutional neural network
(CNN)-based methods, while powerful, often suffer from substantial
computational overhead, limited generalizability, and poor interpretability
across diverse populations. This study proposes a training-free segmentation
approach based on keypoint tracking, which integrates keypoint selection with
Lucas-Kanade optical flow. The proposed method achieves a mean Dice similarity
coefficient (DSC) ranging from 0.6 to 0.7, depending on the keypoint selection
strategy, performing comparably to state-of-the-art CNN-based models while
substantially reducing computational demands and enhancing interpretability.
This scalable framework presents a robust and explainable alternative for
muscle segmentation in clinical and research applications.

*Li Li,Yingzhe Peng,Xu Yang,Ruoxi Cheng,Haiyang Xu,Ming Yan,Fei Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于嵌入的轻量级CLIP（L-CLIP）度量L-CLIPScore，用于高效评估标题质量和训练标题模型。通过参数压缩和知识蒸馏技术，L-CLIP在保持多模态对齐能力的同时减少了计算资源需求。实验验证了其有效性，并发现需与n-gram度量混合使用以避免训练失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有标题评估和训练方法效率不足，需一种轻量且高效的度量标准。

Method: 采用权重复用和矩阵分解压缩参数，设计多模态相似性调节器（SR）损失进行知识蒸馏。

Result: L-CLIP在减少计算资源的同时保持了与原始CLIP相当的多模态对齐能力，L-CLIPScore在评估和训练中表现高效。

Conclusion: L-CLIPScore是一种高效的标题度量标准，但需与n-gram度量结合使用以避免训练失败。

Abstract: We propose a novel embedding-based captioning metric termed as L-CLIPScore
that can be used for efficiently evaluating caption quality and training
captioning model. L-CLIPScore is calculated from a lightweight CLIP (L-CLIP),
which is a dual-encoder architecture compressed and distilled from CLIP. To
compress, we apply two powerful techniques which are weight multiplexing and
matrix decomposition for reducing the parameters of encoders and word embedding
matrix, respectively. To distill, we design a novel multi-modal Similarity
Regulator (SR) loss to transfer more vision-language alignment knowledge.
Specifically, SR loss amplifies the multi-modal embedding similarity if the
given image-text pair is matched and diminishes the similarity if the pair is
non-matched. By compressing and distilling by this novel SR loss, our L-CLIP
achieves comparable multi-modal alignment ability to the original CLIP while it
requires fewer computation resources and running time. We carry out exhaustive
experiments to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of L-CLIPScore when
using it as the judge to evaluate caption quality. We also discover that when
using L-CLIPScore as the supervisor to train the captioning model, it should be
mixed up by an n-gram-based metric and meanwhile analyze why using L-CLIPScore
only will cause fail training.

TL;DR: SGPMIL是一个基于稀疏高斯过程的概率注意力MIL框架，解决了实例级注意力分数的不确定性量化问题，提升了预测的可靠性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数字病理学中，MIL方法通常缺乏对实例相关性不确定性的量化，SGPMIL旨在填补这一空白。

Method: SGPMIL通过稀疏高斯过程学习注意力分数的后验分布，并引入特征缩放以优化训练效率和性能。

Result: 实验表明，SGPMIL在袋级和实例级评估中均表现优异，提升了预测质量和效率。

Conclusion: SGPMIL不仅保持了袋级性能，还显著改进了不确定性下的实例级预测，为数字病理学提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) offers a natural solution for settings where
only coarse, bag-level labels are available, without having access to
instance-level annotations. This is usually the case in digital pathology,
which consists of gigapixel sized images. While deterministic attention-based
MIL approaches achieve strong bag-level performance, they often overlook the
uncertainty inherent in instance relevance. In this paper, we address the lack
of uncertainty quantification in instance-level attention scores by introducing
\textbf{SGPMIL}, a new probabilistic attention-based MIL framework grounded in
Sparse Gaussian Processes (SGP). By learning a posterior distribution over
attention scores, SGPMIL enables principled uncertainty estimation, resulting
in more reliable and calibrated instance relevance maps. Our approach not only
preserves competitive bag-level performance but also significantly improves the
quality and interpretability of instance-level predictions under uncertainty.
SGPMIL extends prior work by introducing feature scaling in the SGP predictive
mean function, leading to faster training, improved efficiency, and enhanced
instance-level performance. Extensive experiments on multiple well-established
digital pathology datasets highlight the effectiveness of our approach across
both bag- and instance-level evaluations. Our code will be made publicly
available.

Motivation: 现有公开数据集在场景复杂性、分辨率和多样性方面存在局限，无法满足实际需求，因此需要更贴近现实的数据集。

Method: 通过四个非重叠的高分辨率摄像头（4K分辨率，15 fps）采集40分钟标记视频，包含512辆车的跨摄像头关联数据。

Result: 提供了车辆检测、单摄像头跟踪、车辆重识别和多摄像头跟踪的基线结果，数据集公开可用。

Conclusion: RoundaboutHD为多摄像头车辆跟踪研究提供了更贴近现实的基准数据集，支持多种任务和进一步分析。

Abstract: The multi-camera vehicle tracking (MCVT) framework holds significant
potential for smart city applications, including anomaly detection, traffic
density estimation, and suspect vehicle tracking. However, current publicly
available datasets exhibit limitations, such as overly simplistic scenarios,
low-resolution footage, and insufficiently diverse conditions, creating a
considerable gap between academic research and real-world scenario. To fill
this gap, we introduce RoundaboutHD, a comprehensive, high-resolution
multi-camera vehicle tracking benchmark dataset specifically designed to
represent real-world roundabout scenarios. RoundaboutHD provides a total of 40
minutes of labelled video footage captured by four non-overlapping,
high-resolution (4K resolution, 15 fps) cameras. In total, 512 unique vehicle
identities are annotated across different camera views, offering rich
cross-camera association data. RoundaboutHD offers temporal consistency video
footage and enhanced challenges, including increased occlusions and nonlinear
movement inside the roundabout. In addition to the full MCVT dataset, several
subsets are also available for object detection, single camera tracking, and
image-based vehicle re-identification (ReID) tasks. Vehicle model information
and camera modelling/ geometry information are also included to support further
analysis. We provide baseline results for vehicle detection, single-camera
tracking, image-based vehicle re-identification, and multi-camera tracking. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出基于谱总变分（STV）特征的弱学习器集成方法，解决计算机视觉中训练数据不足的问题，并在医学影像任务中表现优于深度学习和Radiomics方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决计算机视觉中训练数据不足的问题，提出一种基于STV特征的集成学习方法。

Method: 使用STV特征构建弱学习器集成，STV特征与总变分次梯度的非线性特征函数相关，能有效表征多尺度纹理。

Result: 在医学影像任务中，STV学习器（AUC=0.87）优于神经网络（AUC=0.75）和Radiomics（AUC=0.79），尤其是CT图像中的精细STV尺度对PET高摄取具有指示性。

Conclusion: 基于STV特征的集成学习方法在数据不足时表现优异，尤其在医学影像分析中具有潜力。

Abstract: Solving computer vision problems through machine learning, one often
encounters lack of sufficient training data. To mitigate this we propose the
use of ensembles of weak learners based on spectral total-variation (STV)
features (Gilboa 2014). The features are related to nonlinear eigenfunctions of
the total-variation subgradient and can characterize well textures at various
scales. It was shown (Burger et-al 2016) that, in the one-dimensional case,
orthogonal features are generated, whereas in two-dimensions the features are
empirically lowly correlated. Ensemble learning theory advocates the use of
lowly correlated weak learners. We thus propose here to design ensembles using
learners based on STV features. To show the effectiveness of this paradigm we
examine a hard real-world medical imaging problem: the predictive value of
computed tomography (CT) data for high uptake in positron emission tomography
(PET) for patients suspected of skeletal metastases. The database consists of
457 scans with 1524 unique pairs of registered CT and PET slices. Our approach
is compared to deep-learning methods and to Radiomics features, showing STV
learners perform best (AUC=0.87), compared to neural nets (AUC=0.75) and
Radiomics (AUC=0.79). We observe that fine STV scales in CT images are
especially indicative for the presence of high uptake in PET.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出HieraRS方法，解决遥感影像多粒度层次分类问题，支持跨域任务迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在遥感影像层次分类中存在多粒度预测能力不足和跨域迁移困难的问题。

Method: 提出HieraRS范式，结合BHCCM机制和TransLU框架，支持多粒度预测和跨域迁移。

Result: 构建MM-5B数据集，HieraRS在语义一致性和分类准确性上表现优异。

Conclusion: HieraRS提升了遥感影像层次分类的灵活性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Hierarchical land cover and land use (LCLU) classification aims to assign
pixel-wise labels with multiple levels of semantic granularity to remote
sensing (RS) imagery. However, existing deep learning-based methods face two
major challenges: 1) They predominantly adopt a flat classification paradigm,
which limits their ability to generate end-to-end multi-granularity
hierarchical predictions aligned with tree-structured hierarchies used in
practice. 2) Most cross-domain studies focus on performance degradation caused
by sensor or scene variations, with limited attention to transferring LCLU
models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous hierarchies (e.g., LCLU to crop
classification). These limitations hinder the flexibility and generalization of
LCLU models in practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose
HieraRS, a novel hierarchical interpretation paradigm that enables
multi-granularity predictions and supports the efficient transfer of LCLU
models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous tree-structured hierarchies. We
introduce the Bidirectional Hierarchical Consistency Constraint Mechanism
(BHCCM), which can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream flat classification
models to generate hierarchical predictions, while improving both semantic
consistency and classification accuracy. Furthermore, we present TransLU, a
dual-branch cross-domain transfer framework comprising two key components:
Cross-Domain Knowledge Sharing (CDKS) and Cross-Domain Semantic Alignment
(CDSA). TransLU supports dynamic category expansion and facilitates the
effective adaptation of LCLU models to heterogeneous hierarchies. In addition,
we construct MM-5B, a large-scale multi-modal hierarchical land use dataset
featuring pixel-wise annotations. The code and MM-5B dataset will be released
at: https://github.com/AI-Tianlong/HieraRS.

Method: 引入Geo-ORBIT框架，包含GeoLane轻量级车道检测模型、Meta-GeoLane个性化参数学习和FedMeta-GeoLane联邦学习策略，并与CARLA和SUMO集成。

Result: FedMeta-GeoLane在多样化城市场景中表现优于基线方法，几何误差更低，泛化能力更强，通信开销大幅减少。

Conclusion: Geo-ORBIT为灵活、上下文感知的基础设施建模奠定了基础，框架已开源。

Abstract: Digital Twins (DT) have the potential to transform traffic management and
operations by creating dynamic, virtual representations of transportation
systems that sense conditions, analyze operations, and support decision-making.
A key component for DT of the transportation system is dynamic roadway geometry
sensing. However, existing approaches often rely on static maps or costly
sensors, limiting scalability and adaptability. Additionally, large-scale DTs
that collect and analyze data from multiple sources face challenges in privacy,
communication, and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, we
introduce Geo-ORBIT (Geometrical Operational Roadway Blueprint with Integrated
Twin), a unified framework that combines real-time lane detection, DT
synchronization, and federated meta-learning. At the core of Geo-ORBIT is
GeoLane, a lightweight lane detection model that learns lane geometries from
vehicle trajectory data using roadside cameras. We extend this model through
Meta-GeoLane, which learns to personalize detection parameters for local
entities, and FedMeta-GeoLane, a federated learning strategy that ensures
scalable and privacy-preserving adaptation across roadside deployments. Our
system is integrated with CARLA and SUMO to create a high-fidelity DT that
renders highway scenarios and captures traffic flows in real-time. Extensive
experiments across diverse urban scenes show that FedMeta-GeoLane consistently
outperforms baseline and meta-learning approaches, achieving lower geometric
error and stronger generalization to unseen locations while drastically
reducing communication overhead. This work lays the foundation for flexible,
context-aware infrastructure modeling in DTs. The framework is publicly
available at https://github.com/raynbowy23/FedMeta-GeoLane.git.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Birkhoff的无数据压缩算法，用于压缩Segment Anything Model (SAM)及其变体，具有高效、通用和紧凑的特点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于SAM及其变体在零样本分割中的优异表现，压缩这些模型成为迫切需求。

Method: Birkhoff采用Hyper-Compression算法，将高维参数向量转化为低维标量，并设计了HyperLinear层以加速推理。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，Birkhoff在压缩时间、压缩比、性能和推理速度上表现优异，例如在SAM2-B上实现了5.17倍的压缩比且性能下降小于1%。

Conclusion: Birkhoff是一种高效、通用的压缩方法，适用于SAM及其变体，且无需微调数据。

Abstract: Due to the excellent performance in yielding high-quality, zero-shot
segmentation, Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its variants have been widely
applied in diverse scenarios such as healthcare and intelligent manufacturing.
Therefore, effectively compressing SAMs has become an increasingly pressing
practical need. In this study, we propose Birkhoff, a novel data-free
compression algorithm for SAM and its variants. Unlike quantization, pruning,
distillation, and other compression methods, Birkhoff embodies versatility
across model types, agility in deployment, faithfulness to the original model,
and compactness in model size. Specifically, Birkhoff introduces a novel
compression algorithm: Hyper-Compression, whose core principle is to find a
dense trajectory to turn a high-dimensional parameter vector into a
low-dimensional scalar. Furthermore, Birkhoff designs a dedicated linear layer
operator, HyperLinear, to fuse decompression and matrix multiplication to
significantly accelerate inference of the compressed SAMs. Extensive
experiments on 18 SAMs in the COCO, LVIS, and SA-1B datasets show that Birkhoff
performs consistently and competitively in compression time, compression ratio,
post-compression performance, and inference speed. For example, Birkhoff can
achieve a compression ratio of 5.17x on SAM2-B, with less than 1% performance
drop without using any fine-tuning data. Moreover, the compression is finished
within 60 seconds for all models.

Conclusion: 深度特征提取和足够原型覆盖对高性能至关重要，模型在模式识别中有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: This study presents a hybrid model for classifying handwritten digits in the
MNIST dataset, combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a multi-well
Hopfield network. The approach employs a CNN to extract high-dimensional
features from input images, which are then clustered into class-specific
prototypes using k-means clustering. These prototypes serve as attractors in a
multi-well energy landscape, where a Hopfield network performs classification
by minimizing an energy function that balances feature similarity and class
assignment.The model's design enables robust handling of intraclass
variability, such as diverse handwriting styles, while providing an
interpretable framework through its energy-based decision process. Through
systematic optimization of the CNN architecture and the number of wells, the
model achieves a high test accuracy of 99.2% on 10,000 MNIST images,
demonstrating its effectiveness for image classification tasks. The findings
highlight the critical role of deep feature extraction and sufficient prototype
coverage in achieving high performance, with potential for broader applications
in pattern recognition.

Conclusion: CoPart通过部分感知的扩散框架，显著提升了3D生成的几何一致性和可控性。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D generation have transitioned from multi-view 2D
rendering approaches to 3D-native latent diffusion frameworks that exploit
geometric priors in ground truth data. Despite progress, three key limitations
persist: (1) Single-latent representations fail to capture complex multi-part
geometries, causing detail degradation; (2) Holistic latent coding neglects
part independence and interrelationships critical for compositional design; (3)
Global conditioning mechanisms lack fine-grained controllability. Inspired by
human 3D design workflows, we propose CoPart - a part-aware diffusion framework
that decomposes 3D objects into contextual part latents for coherent multi-part
generation. This paradigm offers three advantages: i) Reduces encoding
complexity through part decomposition; ii) Enables explicit part relationship
modeling; iii) Supports part-level conditioning. We further develop a mutual
guidance strategy to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models for joint part
latent denoising, ensuring both geometric coherence and foundation model
priors. To enable large-scale training, we construct Partverse - a novel 3D
part dataset derived from Objaverse through automated mesh segmentation and
human-verified annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate CoPart's superior
capabilities in part-level editing, articulated object generation, and scene
composition with unprecedented controllability.

Motivation: 传统渲染方法在数据压缩和计算效率上存在局限，CLiFT旨在解决这些问题，同时保持高质量的渲染效果。

Method: 使用多视图编码器将图像和相机位姿转换为令牌，通过潜在空间K均值选择代表性光线作为簇中心，构建压缩令牌（CLiFTs）。测试时根据目标视图和计算预算合成新视图。

Result: 在RealEstate10K和DL3DV数据集上验证了方法的有效性，实现了显著的数据压缩和高质量的渲染效果，同时提供了数据大小、渲染质量和速度的权衡。

Conclusion: CLiFT是一种高效且灵活的神经渲染方法，适用于动态场景表示和实时渲染需求。

Abstract: This paper proposes a neural rendering approach that represents a scene as
"compressed light-field tokens (CLiFTs)", retaining rich appearance and
geometric information of a scene. CLiFT enables compute-efficient rendering by
compressed tokens, while being capable of changing the number of tokens to
represent a scene or render a novel view with one trained network. Concretely,
given a set of images, multi-view encoder tokenizes the images with the camera
poses. Latent-space K-means selects a reduced set of rays as cluster centroids
using the tokens. The multi-view ``condenser'' compresses the information of
all the tokens into the centroid tokens to construct CLiFTs. At test time,
given a target view and a compute budget (i.e., the number of CLiFTs), the
system collects the specified number of nearby tokens and synthesizes a novel
view using a compute-adaptive renderer. Extensive experiments on RealEstate10K
and DL3DV datasets quantitatively and qualitatively validate our approach,
achieving significant data reduction with comparable rendering quality and the
highest overall rendering score, while providing trade-offs of data size,
rendering quality, and rendering speed.

Motivation: 现有自回归视频生成器存在架构不一致、依赖外部文本编码器或高延迟问题，Lumos-1旨在保留标准LLM架构的同时提升性能。

Method: 采用3D RoPE和MM-RoPE增强时空相关性，提出AR-DF策略解决帧间损失不平衡问题，并通过高效训练技术优化资源使用。

Result: Lumos-1在48个GPU上预训练，性能与EMU3、COSMOS-Video2World和OpenSoraPlan相当。

Conclusion: Lumos-1通过改进的架构和训练策略，实现了高效且高质量的自回归视频生成。

Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have unified a vast range of
language tasks, inspiring preliminary efforts in autoregressive video
generation. Existing autoregressive video generators either diverge from
standard LLM architectures, depend on bulky external text encoders, or incur
prohibitive latency due to next-token decoding. In this paper, we introduce
Lumos-1, an autoregressive video generator that retains the LLM architecture
with minimal architectural modifications. To inject spatiotemporal correlations
in LLMs, we identify the efficacy of incorporating 3D RoPE and diagnose its
imbalanced frequency spectrum ranges. Therefore, we propose MM-RoPE, a RoPE
scheme that preserves the original textual RoPE while providing comprehensive
frequency spectra and scaled 3D positions for modeling multimodal
spatiotemporal data. Moreover, Lumos-1 resorts to a token dependency strategy
that obeys intra-frame bidirectionality and inter-frame temporal causality.
Based on this dependency strategy, we identify the issue of frame-wise loss
imbalance caused by spatial information redundancy and solve it by proposing
Autoregressive Discrete Diffusion Forcing (AR-DF). AR-DF introduces temporal
tube masking during training with a compatible inference-time masking policy to
avoid quality degradation. By using memory-efficient training techniques, we
pre-train Lumos-1 on only 48 GPUs, achieving performance comparable to EMU3 on
GenEval, COSMOS-Video2World on VBench-I2V, and OpenSoraPlan on VBench-T2V. Code

Motivation: 现有方法多依赖统计信号处理或深度神经网络，而结合统计与物理建模的研究较少，因此探索一种理论模型以整合两者。

Method: 将房间脉冲响应分解为可解释参数（如高斯白噪声滤波、频率相关指数衰减和自回归滤波），并使用变分自由能成本函数进行参数估计。

Result: 在噪声环境中，该方法在干声和混响声信号上优于传统解卷积方法，并通过客观指标验证。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为房间脉冲响应估计提供了一种理论支持的新途径，尤其在噪声环境下表现优异。

Abstract: Room impulse response estimation is essential for tasks like speech
dereverberation, which improves automatic speech recognition. Most existing
methods rely on either statistical signal processing or deep neural networks
designed to replicate signal processing principles. However, combining
statistical and physical modeling for RIR estimation remains largely
unexplored. This paper proposes a novel approach integrating both aspects
through a theoretically grounded model. The RIR is decomposed into
interpretable parameters: white Gaussian noise filtered by a
frequency-dependent exponential decay (e.g. modeling wall absorption) and an
autoregressive filter (e.g. modeling microphone response). A variational
free-energy cost function enables practical parameter estimation. As a proof of
concept, we show that given dry and reverberant speech signals, the proposed
method outperforms classical deconvolution in noisy environments, as validated
by objective metrics.

AF-Think, and AF-Chat, and train AF3 with a novel five-stage curriculum-based
training strategy. Trained on only open-source audio data, AF3 achieves new
SOTA results on over 20+ (long) audio understanding and reasoning benchmarks,
surpassing both open-weight and closed-source models trained on much larger
datasets.

*Anthony Miyaguchi,Murilo Gustineli,Adrian Cheung*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 论文介绍了针对BirdCLEF+ 2025挑战的两种策略：优化预训练模型和提出轻量级STSG方法，以在严格计算限制下实现高效分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战要求在90分钟CPU推理时间内分类206种生物声音，现有深度学习方法难以满足，需探索高效解决方案。

Method: 1. 优化Bioacoustics Model Zoo的预训练模型，使用TFLite加速推理；2. 提出STSG方法，将音频转换为离散谱图标记并学习上下文嵌入。

Result: 优化模型Perch在16分钟内完成推理，ROC-AUC为0.729（公开）/0.711（私有）；STSG方法在6分钟内完成，ROC-AUC为0.559（公开）/0.520（私有）。

Conclusion: 优化预训练模型和STSG方法均能在严格计算限制下实现高效分类，STSG展示了快速标记化方法的潜力。

Abstract: The BirdCLEF+ 2025 challenge requires classifying 206 species, including
birds, mammals, insects, and amphibians, from soundscape recordings under a
strict 90-minute CPU-only inference deadline, making many state-of-the-art deep
learning approaches impractical. To address this constraint, the DS@GT BirdCLEF
team explored two strategies. First, we establish competitive baselines by
optimizing pre-trained models from the Bioacoustics Model Zoo for CPU
inference. Using TFLite, we achieved a nearly 10x inference speedup for the
Perch model, enabling it to run in approximately 16 minutes and achieve a final
ROC-AUC score of 0.729 on the public leaderboard post-competition and 0.711 on
the private leaderboard. The best model from the zoo was BirdSetEfficientNetB1,
with a public score of 0.810 and a private score of 0.778. Second, we introduce
a novel, lightweight pipeline named Spectrogram Token Skip-Gram (STSG) that
treats bioacoustics as a sequence modeling task. This method converts audio
into discrete "spectrogram tokens" by clustering Mel-spectrograms using Faiss
K-means and then learns high-quality contextual embeddings for these tokens in
an unsupervised manner with a Word2Vec skip-gram model. For classification,
embeddings within a 5-second window are averaged and passed to a linear model.
With a projected inference time of 6 minutes for a 700-minute test set, the
STSG approach achieved a final ROC-AUC public score of 0.559 and a private
score of 0.520, demonstrating the viability of fast tokenization approaches
with static embeddings for bioacoustic classification. Supporting code for this

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于主动学习的TTS语料库构建方法，通过迭代数据收集与模型训练，构建高效语料库，提升语音合成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模数据集的构建面临存储等挑战，传统方法效率不高。

Method: 基于主动学习的迭代方法，交替进行数据收集与模型训练，选择对模型改进更有价值的数据。

Result: 实验表明，该方法构建的语料库在相同规模下能实现更高质量的语音合成。

Conclusion: 主动学习方法能高效构建TTS语料库，提升语音合成效果。

Abstract: The construction of high-quality datasets is a cornerstone of modern
text-to-speech (TTS) systems. However, the increasing scale of available data
poses significant challenges, including storage constraints. To address these
issues, we propose a TTS corpus construction method based on active learning.
Unlike traditional feed-forward and model-agnostic corpus construction
approaches, our method iteratively alternates between data collection and model
training, thereby focusing on acquiring data that is more informative for model
improvement. This approach enables the construction of a data-efficient corpus.
Experimental results demonstrate that the corpus constructed using our method
enables higher-quality speech synthesis than corpora of the same size.

*Tali Dror,Iftach Shoham,Moshe Buchris,Oren Gal,Haim Permuter,Gilad Katz,Eliya Nachmani*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于离散扩散模型的音频修复方法，适用于长缺失段（最长500毫秒），在MusicNet和MTG数据集上表现优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频修复方法在缺失段超过100毫秒时质量下降，需改进长缺失段的修复效果。

Method: 使用预训练音频标记器生成离散表示，直接在离散潜在空间建模生成过程。

Result: 在300毫秒和500毫秒的缺失段上，方法表现优于基线，尤其在长缺失段中更稳定和语义连贯。

Conclusion: 该方法为长缺失段的音频修复提供了鲁棒解决方案，适用于音乐录音的恢复。

Abstract: Audio inpainting refers to the task of reconstructing missing segments in
corrupted audio recordings. While prior approaches-including waveform and
spectrogram-based diffusion models-have shown promising results for short gaps,
they often degrade in quality when gaps exceed 100 milliseconds (ms). In this
work, we introduce a novel inpainting method based on discrete diffusion
modeling, which operates over tokenized audio representations produced by a
pre-trained audio tokenizer. Our approach models the generative process
directly in the discrete latent space, enabling stable and semantically
coherent reconstruction of missing audio. We evaluate the method on the
MusicNet dataset using both objective and perceptual metrics across gap
durations up to 300 ms. We further evaluated our approach on the MTG dataset,
extending the gap duration to 500 ms. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves competitive or superior performance compared to existing
baselines, particularly for longer gaps, offering a robust solution for
restoring degraded musical recordings. Audio examples of our proposed method
can be found at https://iftach21.github.io/

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出一种方法，通过反转波形片段和语音分离技术，使环境录音中的语音不可理解，同时保持音频质量和声学场景完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 环境录音中可能包含可理解的语音，引发隐私问题，限制了数据的分析、共享和重用。

Method: 采用波形片段反转和语音分离技术，结合语音活动检测，精确破坏语音内容。

Result: 方法显著降低语音可理解性（97.9% WER），对声源检测影响小（2.7% SCAD），音频质量高（FAD 1.40）。

Conclusion: 该方法有效保护隐私，同时保持音频质量和声学场景完整性，随机拼接可增强抗恢复能力。

Abstract: Environmental sound recordings often contain intelligible speech, raising
privacy concerns that limit analysis, sharing and reuse of data. In this paper,
we introduce a method that renders speech unintelligible while preserving both
the integrity of the acoustic scene, and the overall audio quality. Our
approach involves reversing waveform segments to distort speech content. This
process is enhanced through a voice activity detection and speech separation
pipeline, which allows for more precise targeting of speech.
  In order to demonstrate the effectivness of the proposed approach, we
consider a three-part evaluation protocol that assesses: 1) speech
intelligibility using Word Error Rate (WER), 2) sound sources detectability
using Sound source Classification Accuracy-Drop (SCAD) from a widely used
pre-trained model, and 3) audio quality using the Fr\'echet Audio Distance
(FAD), computed with our reference dataset that contains unaltered speech.
Experiments on this simulated evaluation dataset, which consists of linear
mixtures of speech and environmental sound scenes, show that our method
achieves satisfactory speech intelligibility reduction (97.9% WER), minimal
degradation of the sound sources detectability (2.7% SCAD), and high perceptual
quality (FAD of 1.40). An ablation study further highlights the contribution of
each component of the pipeline. We also show that incorporating random splicing
to our speech content privacy enforcement method can enhance the algorithm's
robustness to attempt to recover the clean speech, at a slight cost of audio
quality.

*Jingjing Tang,Xin Wang,Zhe Zhang,Junichi Yamagishi,Geraint Wiggins,George Fazekas*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: MIDI-VALLE是一种基于VALLE框架的神经编解码语言模型，用于从MIDI生成高质量音频表演，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统音乐表演合成模型难以适应多样化的MIDI来源、音乐风格和录音环境，需要更通用的解决方案。

Method: 改进VALLE框架，通过参考音频和MIDI作为条件输入，将MIDI和音频编码为离散标记，增强模型的一致性和鲁棒性。

Result: 在ATEPP和Maestro数据集上，MIDI-VALLE的Frechet Audio Distance降低75%以上，听众测试中表现显著优于基线。

Conclusion: MIDI-VALLE在音乐表演合成中表现出卓越的通用性和合成质量，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Generating expressive audio performances from music scores requires models to
capture both instrument acoustics and human interpretation. Traditional music
performance synthesis pipelines follow a two-stage approach, first generating
expressive performance MIDI from a score, then synthesising the MIDI into
audio. However, the synthesis models often struggle to generalise across
diverse MIDI sources, musical styles, and recording environments. To address
these challenges, we propose MIDI-VALLE, a neural codec language model adapted
from the VALLE framework, which was originally designed for zero-shot
personalised text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. For performance MIDI-to-audio
synthesis, we improve the architecture to condition on a reference audio
performance and its corresponding MIDI. Unlike previous TTS-based systems that
rely on piano rolls, MIDI-VALLE encodes both MIDI and audio as discrete tokens,
facilitating a more consistent and robust modelling of piano performances.
Furthermore, the model's generalisation ability is enhanced by training on an
extensive and diverse piano performance dataset. Evaluation results show that
MIDI-VALLE significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline, achieving
over 75% lower Frechet Audio Distance on the ATEPP and Maestro datasets. In the
listening test, MIDI-VALLE received 202 votes compared to 58 for the baseline,
demonstrating improved synthesis quality and generalisation across diverse
performance MIDI inputs.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: FreeAudio提出了一种无需训练的时序控制文本到音频生成框架，支持长文本提示的精确时序控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2A方法因音频-文本对齐数据有限，难以处理复杂时序控制提示。

Method: 利用LLM规划时间窗口并重述描述，结合解耦聚合注意力控制和上下文潜在组合。

Result: FreeAudio在无需训练方法中达到最佳时序控制合成质量，与训练方法相当。

Conclusion: FreeAudio为时序控制长文本T2A合成开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Text-to-audio (T2A) generation has achieved promising results with the recent
advances in generative models. However, because of the limited quality and
quantity of temporally-aligned audio-text pairs, existing T2A methods struggle
to handle the complex text prompts that contain precise timing control, e.g.,
"owl hooted at 2.4s-5.2s". Recent works have explored data augmentation
techniques or introduced timing conditions as model inputs to enable
timing-conditioned 10-second T2A generation, while their synthesis quality is
still limited. In this work, we propose a novel training-free timing-controlled
T2A framework, FreeAudio, making the first attempt to enable timing-controlled
long-form T2A generation, e.g., "owl hooted at 2.4s-5.2s and crickets chirping
at 0s-24s". Specifically, we first employ an LLM to plan non-overlapping time
windows and recaption each with a refined natural language description, based
on the input text and timing prompts. Then we introduce: 1) Decoupling and
Aggregating Attention Control for precise timing control; 2) Contextual Latent
Composition for local smoothness and Reference Guidance for global consistency.
Extensive experiments show that: 1) FreeAudio achieves state-of-the-art
timing-conditioned T2A synthesis quality among training-free methods and is
comparable to leading training-based methods; 2) FreeAudio demonstrates
comparable long-form generation quality with training-based Stable Audio and
paves the way for timing-controlled long-form T2A synthesis. Demo samples are

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于音素的POI语音深度伪造检测方法，通过分解参考音频为音素构建详细说话人特征，实现细粒度检测，兼具高准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI的进步使得语音深度伪造广泛传播，威胁数字信任，现有POI方法虽性能优异但缺乏细粒度和可解释性。

Method: 将参考音频分解为音素构建说话人特征，测试样本音素与特征逐一比对，检测合成痕迹。

Result: 方法与传统方法准确率相当，但具有更强的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 通过音素分析，为可解释的说话人中心深度伪造检测开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have made the creation of speech deepfakes
widely accessible, posing serious challenges to digital trust. To counter this,
various speech deepfake detection strategies have been proposed, including
Person-of-Interest (POI) approaches, which focus on identifying impersonations
of specific individuals by modeling and analyzing their unique vocal traits.
Despite their excellent performance, the existing methods offer limited
granularity and lack interpretability. In this work, we propose a POI-based
speech deepfake detection method that operates at the phoneme level. Our
approach decomposes reference audio into phonemes to construct a detailed
speaker profile. In inference, phonemes from a test sample are individually
compared against this profile, enabling fine-grained detection of synthetic
artifacts. The proposed method achieves comparable accuracy to traditional
approaches while offering superior robustness and interpretability, key aspects
in multimedia forensics. By focusing on phoneme analysis, this work explores a
novel direction for explainable, speaker-centric deepfake detection.

Motivation: 探讨现代语言识别和说话人识别方法在多语言和跨年龄录音中的表现，尤其是对档案索引的适用性。

Method: 利用UNESCO的历史广播录音数据集，测试Whisper等语言识别系统和说话人嵌入方法的性能。

Result: 语言识别系统能较好处理第二语言和口音语音，但说话人嵌入易受信道、年龄和语言偏见影响。

Conclusion: 说话人识别方法需解决偏见问题，才能适用于档案索引等实际应用。

Abstract: In this study, we leverage a unique UNESCO collection of mid-20th century
radio recordings to probe the robustness of modern off-the-shelf language
identification (LID) and speaker recognition (SR) methods, especially with
respect to the impact of multilingual speakers and cross-age recordings. Our
findings suggest that LID systems, such as Whisper, are increasingly adept at
handling second-language and accented speech. However, speaker embeddings
remain a fragile component of speech processing pipelines that is prone to
biases related to the channel, age, and language. Issues which will need to be
overcome should archives aim to employ SR methods for speaker indexing.

TL;DR: 研究比较了基于大型语言模型（LLM）和传统人工方法的主题分析在心理健康访谈中的应用，发现LLM更具成本效益但缺乏深度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决主题分析在大型医疗研究中资源密集型的问题，探索LLM在心理健康访谈中的潜力。

Method: 使用GPT-4o模型和RISEN提示框架，与传统人工方法（Dedoose）比较，评估代码开发、饱和点和主题合成。

Result: LLM在演绎代码开发上表现类似人类，但在归纳代码和主题合成上不如人类。知识库LLM达到饱和所需的转录本更少。

Conclusion: LLM可用于心理健康研究的定性分析，但需结合人类监督以平衡深度和资源效率。

Abstract: Thematic analysis provides valuable insights into participants' experiences
through coding and theme development, but its resource-intensive nature limits
its use in large healthcare studies. Large language models (LLMs) can analyze
text at scale and identify key content automatically, potentially addressing
these challenges. However, their application in mental health interviews needs
comparison with traditional human analysis. This study evaluates out-of-the-box
and knowledge-base LLM-based thematic analysis against traditional methods
using transcripts from a stress-reduction trial with healthcare workers.
OpenAI's GPT-4o model was used along with the Role, Instructions, Steps,
End-Goal, Narrowing (RISEN) prompt engineering framework and compared to human
analysis in Dedoose. Each approach developed codes, noted saturation points,
applied codes to excerpts for a subset of participants (n = 20), and
synthesized data into themes. Outputs and performance metrics were compared
directly. LLMs using the RISEN framework developed deductive parent codes
similar to human codes, but humans excelled in inductive child code development
and theme synthesis. Knowledge-based LLMs reached coding saturation with fewer
transcripts (10-15) than the out-of-the-box model (15-20) and humans (90-99).
The out-of-the-box LLM identified a comparable number of excerpts to human
researchers, showing strong inter-rater reliability (K = 0.84), though the
knowledge-based LLM produced fewer excerpts. Human excerpts were longer and
involved multiple codes per excerpt, while LLMs typically applied one code.
Overall, LLM-based thematic analysis proved more cost-effective but lacked the
depth of human analysis. LLMs can transform qualitative analysis in mental
healthcare and clinical research when combined with human oversight to balance
participant perspectives and research resources.

Conclusion: 该数据集为研究用户行为提供了更可靠的基础，并激发了未来研究方向。

Abstract: We contribute a comprehensive dataset to study user attention and purchasing
behavior on Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs). Previous work has relied on
mouse movements as a low-cost large-scale behavioral proxy but also has relied
on self-reported ground-truth labels, collected at post-task, which can be
inaccurate and prone to biases. To address this limitation, we use an eye
tracker to construct an objective ground-truth of continuous visual attention.
Our dataset comprises 2,776 transactional queries on Google SERPs, collected
from 47 participants, and includes: (1) HTML source files, with CSS and images;
(2) rendered SERP screenshots; (3) eye movement data; (4) mouse movement data;
(5) bounding boxes of direct display and organic advertisements; and (6)
scripts for further preprocessing the data. In this paper we provide an
overview of the dataset and baseline experiments (classification tasks) that
can inspire researchers about the different possibilities for future work.

Abstract: This paper introduces a SSSUMO, semi-supervised deep learning approach for
submovement decomposition that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and speed.
While submovement analysis offers valuable insights into motor control,
existing methods struggle with reconstruction accuracy, computational cost, and
validation, due to the difficulty of obtaining hand-labeled data. We address
these challenges using a semi-supervised learning framework. This framework
learns from synthetic data, initially generated from minimum-jerk principles
and then iteratively refined through adaptation to unlabeled human movement
data. Our fully convolutional architecture with differentiable reconstruction
significantly surpasses existing methods on both synthetic and diverse human
motion datasets, demonstrating robustness even in high-noise conditions.
Crucially, the model operates in real-time (less than a millisecond per input
second), a substantial improvement over optimization-based techniques. This
enhanced performance facilitates new applications in human-computer
interaction, rehabilitation medicine, and motor control studies. We demonstrate
the model's effectiveness across diverse human-performed tasks such as
steering, rotation, pointing, object moving, handwriting, and mouse-controlled
gaming, showing notable improvements particularly on challenging datasets where
traditional methods largely fail. Training and benchmarking source code, along
with pre-trained model weights, are made publicly available at

Conclusion: 该方法为阿尔茨海默病及相关痴呆症患者提供隐私保护且高效的情绪识别方案，验证了其在实际场景中的可行性。

Abstract: Emotion detection in older adults is crucial for understanding their
cognitive and emotional well-being, especially in hospital and assisted living
environments. In this work, we investigate an edge-based, non-obtrusive
approach to emotion identification that uses only physiological signals
obtained via wearable sensors. Our dataset includes data from 40 older
individuals. Emotional states were obtained using physiological signals from
the Empatica E4 and Shimmer3 GSR+ wristband and facial expressions were
recorded using camera-based emotion recognition with the iMotion's Facial
Expression Analysis (FEA) module. The dataset also contains twelve emotion
categories in terms of relative intensities. We aim to study how well emotion
recognition can be accomplished using simply physiological sensor data, without
the requirement for cameras or intrusive facial analysis. By leveraging
classical machine learning models, we predict the intensity of emotional
responses based on physiological signals. We achieved the highest 0.782 r2
score with the lowest 0.0006 MSE on the regression task. This method has
significant implications for individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Related
Dementia (ADRD), as well as veterans coping with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder
(PTSD) or other cognitive impairments. Our results across multiple classical
regression models validate the feasibility of this method, paving the way for
privacy-preserving and efficient emotion recognition systems in real-world
settings.

Abstract: We present a graphical, node-based system through which users can visually

limiting linear structure that inhibits creative exploration and ideation.
Further, our node-based approach enables the creation of reusable, shareable
templates that can address different creative tasks. In a small-scale user
study, we find that our graph-based system supports ideation and allows some
users to better visualise and think through their writing process when compared
to a similar conversational interface. We further discuss the weaknesses and
limitations of our system, noting the benefits to creativity that user
interfaces with higher complexity can provide for users who can effectively use
them.

TL;DR: AIRS框架是一个基于AI的家庭康复支持系统，结合3D重建、智能导航和视觉语言模型，为膝关节置换术后康复提供机器引导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决家庭康复环境中缺乏专业指导和隐私保护的问题。

Method: 利用智能手机进行实时3D重建，生成匹配身体的虚拟形象，提供视觉和语言反馈。

Result: 系统通过视频数据库评估，支持视觉和听力障碍者，并具备模块化设计。

Conclusion: AIRS是一个高效、隐私友好的家庭康复解决方案，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Ambient Intelligence Rehabilitation Support (AIRS)
framework, an advanced artificial intelligence-based solution tailored for home
rehabilitation environments. AIRS integrates cutting-edge technologies,
including Real-Time 3D Reconstruction (RT-3DR), intelligent navigation, and
large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), to create a comprehensive system for
machine-guided physical rehabilitation. The general AIRS framework is
demonstrated in rehabilitation scenarios following total knee replacement
(TKR), utilizing a database of 263 video recordings for evaluation. A
smartphone is employed within AIRS to perform RT-3DR of living spaces and has a
body-matched avatar to provide visual feedback about the excercise. This avatar
is necessary in (a) optimizing exercise configurations, including camera
placement, patient positioning, and initial poses, and (b) addressing privacy
concerns and promoting compliance with the AI Act. The system guides users
through the recording process to ensure the collection of properly recorded
videos. AIRS employs two feedback mechanisms: (i) visual 3D feedback, enabling
direct comparisons between prerecorded clinical exercises and patient home
recordings and (ii) VLM-generated feedback, providing detailed explanations and
corrections for exercise errors. The framework also supports people with visual
and hearing impairments. It also features a modular design that can be adapted
to broader rehabilitation contexts. AIRS software components are available for
further use and customization.

TL;DR: 研究比较了两种“轻推”策略（推送通知和灯光调暗）对大学生久坐行为的影响，发现灯光调暗效果略好但舒适度较低，且效果受任务情境影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 久坐对健康有害，现有轻推策略效果和舒适度缺乏比较研究。

Method: 混合设计实验，15名大学生参与，测试三种干预方法（无、推送通知、灯光调暗）和三种任务情境（电脑工作、视频通话、阅读）。

Result: 灯光调暗引发更多站立（1.4次），但66.7%参与者感到不适；推送通知引发1.2次站立，20%不适。效果因任务情境而异。

Conclusion: 自适应轻推系统应根据情境和个人偏好定制干预方式。

Abstract: Prolonged sitting is a health risk leading to metabolic and cardiovascular
diseases. To combat this, various "nudging" strategies encourage stand-ups.
Behavior change triggers use explicit prompts such as smartphone push
notifications or light controls. However, comparisons of the effects of such
interactions, discomfort, and user context have not yet been performed. The
present study evaluated these methods in a mixed design experiment with 15
college students. Three intervention methods (none, push notifications, and
light dimming) and three user task contexts (computer work, video calls, and
reading) were tested. The frequency of standing up and comfort were assessed
after each ten-minute session. Results showed that dimming resulted in slightly
more breaks (1.4 \pm 1.55) than push notification (1.2 \pm 1.08), but caused
discomfort for 66.7% of participants, compared to 20% for notification. The
results were influenced by task context. Dimming was most effective during
video calls and reading, while push notifications were more effective during
computer work. These findings suggest adaptive nudging systems should tailor
interventions based on context and individual preferences.

TL;DR: FlowDrag通过结合几何信息改进拖拽编辑，解决了现有方法因忽略几何一致性导致的失真问题，并在新基准VFD上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有拖拽编辑方法仅关注用户定义的点匹配，忽略了整体几何一致性，导致编辑结果不稳定或失真。

Method: FlowDrag通过构建3D网格并利用能量函数指导变形，将网格位移投影到2D并结合UNet去噪，实现精确编辑。

Result: FlowDrag在VFD和DragBench基准上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FlowDrag通过几何一致性优化拖拽编辑，提升了编辑精度和稳定性，并提出了新的基准VFD用于评估。

Abstract: Drag-based editing allows precise object manipulation through point-based
control, offering user convenience. However, current methods often suffer from
a geometric inconsistency problem by focusing exclusively on matching
user-defined points, neglecting the broader geometry and leading to artifacts
or unstable edits. We propose FlowDrag, which leverages geometric information
for more accurate and coherent transformations. Our approach constructs a 3D
mesh from the image, using an energy function to guide mesh deformation based
on user-defined drag points. The resulting mesh displacements are projected
into 2D and incorporated into a UNet denoising process, enabling precise
handle-to-target point alignment while preserving structural integrity.
Additionally, existing drag-editing benchmarks provide no ground truth, making
it difficult to assess how accurately the edits match the intended
transformations. To address this, we present VFD (VidFrameDrag) benchmark
dataset, which provides ground-truth frames using consecutive shots in a video
dataset. FlowDrag outperforms existing drag-based editing methods on both VFD
Bench and DragBench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在相机-物体关系（如物体方向、相机视角和镜头）的捕捉上表现不佳，原因是训练数据缺乏多样性。

Method: 使用3D资产输入，结合渲染和扩散模型生成逼真图像，并利用大语言模型（LLMs）生成文本提示，构建了Ultimate3D数据集（240K VQAs）。

Result: 在相机-物体关系识别任务上，MLLMs的准确率平均提升了33.4%，显著优于商业模型。

Conclusion: 提出的数据集和框架为MLLMs的广泛应用提供了支持，代码、数据集和基准将开源。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with accurately capturing
camera-object relations, especially for object orientation, camera viewpoint,
and camera shots. This stems from the fact that existing MLLMs are trained on
images with limited diverse camera-object relations and corresponding textual
descriptions. To address this, we propose a synthetic generation pipeline to
create large-scale 3D visual instruction datasets. Our framework takes 3D
assets as input and uses rendering and diffusion-based image generation models
to create photorealistic images preserving precise camera-object relations.
Additionally, large language models (LLMs) are used to generate text prompts
for guiding visual instruction tuning and controlling image generation. We
create Ultimate3D, a dataset of 240K VQAs with precise camera-object
annotations, and corresponding benchmark. MLLMs fine-tuned on our proposed
dataset outperform commercial models by a large margin, achieving an average
accuracy improvement of 33.4% on camera-object relation recognition tasks. Our
code, dataset, and benchmark will contribute to broad MLLM applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种联邦少样本学习框架，结合隐私保护机制，解决呼吸疾病诊断中数据标注不足和隐私保护问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗数据标注的劳动密集型特性导致高质量标注数据集稀缺，且患者隐私问题限制了数据共享。

Method: 采用元随机梯度下降算法防止过拟合，并引入高斯分布的差分隐私噪声保护梯度隐私，通过加权平均算法聚合本地模型。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在差分隐私保护下表现优异，能有效诊断不同结构、类别和分布的呼吸疾病数据。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了数据稀缺和隐私保护问题，为呼吸疾病诊断提供了一种高效且安全的解决方案。

Abstract: The labor-intensive nature of medical data annotation presents a significant
challenge for respiratory disease diagnosis, resulting in a scarcity of
high-quality labeled datasets in resource-constrained settings. Moreover,
patient privacy concerns complicate the direct sharing of local medical data
across institutions, and existing centralized data-driven approaches, which
rely on amounts of available data, often compromise data privacy. This study
proposes a federated few-shot learning framework with privacy-preserving
mechanisms to address the issues of limited labeled data and privacy protection
in diagnosing respiratory diseases. In particular, a meta-stochastic gradient
descent algorithm is proposed to mitigate the overfitting problem that arises
from insufficient data when employing traditional gradient descent methods for
neural network training. Furthermore, to ensure data privacy against gradient
leakage, differential privacy noise from a standard Gaussian distribution is
integrated into the gradients during the training of private models with local
data, thereby preventing the reconstruction of medical images. Given the
impracticality of centralizing respiratory disease data dispersed across
various medical institutions, a weighted average algorithm is employed to
aggregate local diagnostic models from different clients, enhancing the
adaptability of a model across diverse scenarios. Experimental results show
that the proposed method yields compelling results with the implementation of
differential privacy, while effectively diagnosing respiratory diseases using
data from different structures, categories, and distributions.

Motivation: 组合优化在TPE中尚未被充分研究，但在化学和生物学等领域有重要应用。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 泛化TPE中的分类核与数值核，引入距离结构，并针对大规模组合搜索空间优化核计算的时间复杂度。

Result: 实验表明，改进后的TPE在合成问题上能以更少的评估次数找到更好的解。

Conclusion: 提出的算法在Optuna中实现，为组合优化提供了一种高效的TPE改进方法。

Abstract: Tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE) is a versatile hyperparameter
optimization (HPO) method supported by popular HPO tools. Since these HPO tools
have been developed in line with the trend of deep learning (DL), the problem
setups often used in the DL domain have been discussed for TPE such as
multi-objective optimization and multi-fidelity optimization. However, the
practical applications of HPO are not limited to DL, and black-box
combinatorial optimization is actively utilized in some domains, e.g.,
chemistry and biology. As combinatorial optimization has been an untouched, yet
very important, topic in TPE, we propose an efficient combinatorial
optimization algorithm for TPE. In this paper, we first generalize the
categorical kernel with the numerical kernel in TPE, enabling us to introduce a
distance structure to the categorical kernel. Then we discuss modifications for
the newly developed kernel to handle a large combinatorial search space. These
modifications reduce the time complexity of the kernel calculation with respect
to the size of a combinatorial search space. In the experiments using synthetic
problems, we verified that our proposed method identifies better solutions with
fewer evaluations than the original TPE. Our algorithm is available in Optuna,
an open-source framework for HPO.

Motivation: 随着网络物理系统的互联性和空间分布性增强，确保其抵御网络攻击的韧性成为关键。当前数据驱动方法在可解释性和适应性上存在局限。

Method: 提出因果学习视角，包括因果图分析、多视图融合和持续因果图学习，以揭示时空动态因果关系。

Result: 因果模型能提供早期预警信号和根因分析，弥补黑盒检测器的不足。

Conclusion: 论文旨在推动可扩展、自适应、可解释的异常检测系统研究，促进因果驱动方法应对互联基础设施的威胁。

Abstract: As cyber-physical systems grow increasingly interconnected and spatially
distributed, ensuring their resilience against evolving cyberattacks has become
a critical priority. Spatio-Temporal Anomaly detection plays an important role
in ensuring system security and operational integrity. However, current
data-driven approaches, largely driven by black-box deep learning, face
challenges in interpretability, adaptability to distribution shifts, and
robustness under evolving system dynamics. In this paper, we advocate for a
causal learning perspective to advance anomaly detection in spatially
distributed infrastructures that grounds detection in structural cause-effect
relationships. We identify and formalize three key directions: causal graph
profiling, multi-view fusion, and continual causal graph learning, each
offering distinct advantages in uncovering dynamic cause-effect structures
across time and space. Drawing on real-world insights from systems such as
water treatment infrastructures, we illustrate how causal models provide early
warning signals and root cause attribution, addressing the limitations of
black-box detectors. Looking ahead, we outline the future research agenda
centered on multi-modality, generative AI-driven, and scalable adaptive causal
frameworks. Our objective is to lay a new research trajectory toward scalable,
adaptive, explainable, and spatially grounded anomaly detection systems. We
hope to inspire a paradigm shift in cybersecurity research, promoting
causality-driven approaches to address evolving threats in interconnected
infrastructures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如DPO和REBEL只能从偏好对或相对信号中学习，而在线算法如PPO和GRPO需要复杂实现。QRPO旨在填补这一空白。

Method: QRPO使用分位数奖励，通过回归到KL正则化RL目标的闭式解，避免了相对信号的需求，并支持离线学习。

Result: QRPO在聊天和编码评估中表现优于DPO、REBEL和SimPO，且在8B规模模型上验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: QRPO提供了一种简单且高效的离线学习方法，减少了长度偏差，并通过分位数奖励实现了更好的性能。

Abstract: Aligning large language models with pointwise absolute rewards has so far
required online, on-policy algorithms such as PPO and GRPO. In contrast,
simpler methods that can leverage offline or off-policy data, such as DPO and
REBEL, are limited to learning from preference pairs or relative signals. To
bridge this gap, we introduce \emph{Quantile Reward Policy Optimization}
(QRPO), which learns from pointwise absolute rewards while preserving the
simplicity and offline applicability of DPO-like methods. QRPO uses quantile
rewards to enable regression to the closed-form solution of the KL-regularized
RL objective. This reward yields an analytically tractable partition function,
removing the need for relative signals to cancel this term. Moreover, QRPO
scales with increased compute to estimate quantile rewards, opening a new
dimension for pre-computation scaling. Empirically, QRPO consistently achieves
top performance on chat and coding evaluations -- reward model scores,
AlpacaEval 2, and LeetCode -- compared to DPO, REBEL, and SimPO across diverse
datasets and 8B-scale models. Finally, we find that training with robust
rewards instead of converting them to preferences induces less length bias.

Motivation: 大型基础模型微调时，AdamW等优化器占用大量GPU内存，现有方法如LoRA或GaLore存在固定子空间或计算成本高的问题。

Method: 提出MoFaSGD，动态更新低秩SVD表示一阶动量，支持高效谱归一化更新，替代子空间动量累积。

Result: 理论证明MoFaSGD在非凸随机优化中达到最优收敛率，实验显示其在内存减少和性能上优于现有低秩优化方法。

Conclusion: MoFaSGD在内存效率和性能之间取得平衡，适用于大型语言模型对齐任务。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large foundation models presents significant memory challenges
due to stateful optimizers like AdamW, often requiring several times more GPU
memory than inference. While memory-efficient methods like parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA) and optimizer state compression exist, recent
approaches like GaLore bridge these by using low-rank gradient projections and
subspace moment accumulation. However, such methods may struggle with fixed
subspaces or computationally costly offline resampling (e.g., requiring
full-matrix SVDs). We propose Momentum Factorized SGD (MoFaSGD), which
maintains a dynamically updated low-rank SVD representation of the first-order
momentum, closely approximating its full-rank counterpart throughout training.
This factorization enables a memory-efficient fine-tuning method that
adaptively updates the optimization subspace at each iteration. Crucially,
MoFaSGD leverages the computed low-rank momentum factors to perform efficient
spectrally normalized updates, offering an alternative to subspace moment
accumulation. We establish theoretical convergence guarantees for MoFaSGD,
proving it achieves an optimal rate for non-convex stochastic optimization
under standard assumptions. Empirically, we demonstrate MoFaSGD's effectiveness
on large language model alignment benchmarks, achieving a competitive trade-off
between memory reduction (comparable to LoRA) and performance compared to
state-of-the-art low-rank optimization methods. Our implementation is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准优化器（如Adam）在处理PINNs中的刚性或病态系统时难以平衡损失项，导致训练不稳定。

Method: 设计了一种PDE感知的优化器，通过调整参数更新以应对PDE残差梯度的方差，避免梯度不对齐问题。

Result: 在1D Burgers'、Allen-Cahn和KdV方程上，该优化器实现了更平滑的收敛和更低的绝对误差，尤其在梯度变化剧烈区域。

Conclusion: PDE残差感知的自适应方法显著提升了PINNs训练的稳定性，但未来需进一步研究在大规模架构和硬件加速器上的扩展。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful framework
for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by embedding physical
constraints into the loss function. However, standard optimizers such as Adam
often struggle to balance competing loss terms, particularly in stiff or
ill-conditioned systems. In this work, we propose a PDE-aware optimizer that
adapts parameter updates based on the variance of per-sample PDE residual
gradients. This method addresses gradient misalignment without incurring the
heavy computational costs of second-order optimizers such as SOAP. We benchmark
the PDE-aware optimizer against Adam and SOAP on 1D Burgers', Allen-Cahn and
Korteweg-de Vries(KdV) equations. Across both PDEs, the PDE-aware optimizer
achieves smoother convergence and lower absolute errors, particularly in
regions with sharp gradients. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of PDE
residual-aware adaptivity in enhancing stability in PINNs training. While
promising, further scaling on larger architectures and hardware accelerators
remains an important direction for future research.

Conclusion: QRPINNs结合自适应采样可进一步提升性能，为高维PDE求解提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks have shown promise in solving partial
differential equations (PDEs) by integrating physical constraints into neural
network training, but their performance is sensitive to the sampling of points.
Based on the impressive performance of quasi Monte-Carlo methods in high
dimensional problems, this paper proposes Quasi-Random Physics-Informed Neural
Networks (QRPINNs), which use low-discrepancy sequences for sampling instead of
random points directly from the domain. Theoretically, QRPINNs have been proven
to have a better convergence rate than PINNs. Empirically, experiments
demonstrate that QRPINNs significantly outperform PINNs and some representative
adaptive sampling methods, especially in high-dimensional PDEs. Furthermore,
combining QRPINNs with adaptive sampling can further improve the performance.

Result: 在测试问题和实际化工过程模拟中，KKT-Hardnet比多层感知机和传统PINNs具有更高的准确性和严格的约束满足。

Conclusion: KKT-Hardnet为复杂系统的可靠混合建模提供了一种新方法，能够有效整合领域知识。

Abstract: Traditional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) do not guarantee strict
constraint satisfaction. This is problematic in engineering systems where minor
violations of governing laws can significantly degrade the reliability and
consistency of model predictions. In this work, we develop KKT-Hardnet, a PINN
architecture that enforces both linear and nonlinear equality and inequality
constraints up to machine precision. It leverages a projection onto the
feasible region through solving Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of a
distance minimization problem. Furthermore, we reformulate the nonlinear KKT
conditions using log-exponential transformation to construct a general sparse
system with only linear and exponential terms, thereby making the projection
differentiable. We apply KKT-Hardnet on both test problems and a real-world
chemical process simulation. Compared to multilayer perceptrons and PINNs,
KKT-Hardnet achieves higher accuracy and strict constraint satisfaction. This
approach allows the integration of domain knowledge into machine learning
towards reliable hybrid modeling of complex systems.

Abstract: Traffic accidents are rare, yet high-impact events that require long-context
multimodal reasoning for accurate risk forecasting. In this paper, we introduce
ALCo-FM, a unified adaptive long-context foundation model that computes a

encodes and fuses these multimodal data via shallow cross attention. Following
a local GAT layer and a BigBird-style sparse global transformer over H3

relationships between items. One challenge with many machine learning
approaches is incorporating new items, as these approaches rely heavily on
historical data. We develop Text-LENS by extending the LENS partial variational
auto-encoder for educational assessment to leverage item text embeddings, and
explore the impact on predictive performance and generalization to previously
unseen items. We examine performance on two datasets: Eedi, a publicly
available dataset that includes item content, and LLM-Sim, a novel dataset with
test items produced by an LLM. We find that Text-LENS matches LENS' performance
on seen items and improves upon it in a variety of conditions involving unseen
items; it effectively learns student proficiency from and makes predictions
about student performance on new items.

Result: 量子SVM性能优于经典方法，F1分数超80%，召回率提升36%。

Conclusion: 量子机器学习结合可穿戴数据为临床和辅助生活提供无干扰情绪监测基础。

Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of inferring emotional states exclusively from
physiological signals, thereby presenting a privacy-preserving alternative to
conventional facial recognition techniques. We conduct a performance comparison
of classical machine learning algorithms and hybrid quantum machine learning
(QML) methods with a quantum kernel-based model. Our results indicate that the
quantum-enhanced SVM surpasses classical counterparts in classification
performance across all emotion categories, even when trained on limited
datasets. The F1 scores over all classes are over 80% with around a maximum of
36% improvement in the recall values. The integration of wearable sensor data
with quantum machine learning not only enhances accuracy and robustness but
also facilitates unobtrusive emotion recognition. This methodology holds
promise for populations with impaired communication abilities, such as
individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) and veterans
with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The findings establish an early
foundation for passive emotional monitoring in clinical and assisted living
conditions.

Result: 实验显示CTRLS在推理准确性、多样性和探索效率上均有提升。

Conclusion: CTRLS通过结构化建模和强化学习，显著改进了思维链推理的性能和探索能力。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enables large language models (LLMs) to
break down complex problems into interpretable intermediate steps,
significantly enhancing model transparency and performance in reasoning tasks.
However, conventional CoT methods rely on heuristic sampling without structured
modeling of reasoning transitions, constraining their ability to systematically
explore and discover diverse and effective reasoning trajectories. In this
work, we introduce CTRLS, a framework that formulates CoT reasoning as a Markov
decision process (MDP) with latent state transitions, enabling principled and
state-aware exploration via distributional reinforcement learning. By modelling
reasoning actions as explicit probability distributions in latent space, our
approach explicitly models epistemic uncertainty, facilitating robust
exploration of the reasoning space. As part of our framework, we introduce an
on-policy reinforcement learning strategy incorporating epsilon-greedy
exploration and entropy-based regularization to iteratively refine latent state
transitions without requiring additional fine-tuning of the underlying LLM.
Theoretical analyses provide evidence lower bounds (ELBO), theoretically
grounding our transition-aware modeling of latent reasoning dynamics. Further
experiments demonstrate improvements in reasoning accuracy, diversity, and
exploration efficiency across benchmark reasoning tasks.

<details>

Motivation: 现有攻击方法依赖梯度信息，导致优化问题从离散空间松弛为连续空间，结果远离最优解，且无法适应不可微目标。

Method: 引入进化算法直接解决离散优化问题，支持任何黑盒模型和目标，无需可微代理损失函数。

Result: EvA攻击在实验中平均比现有最佳攻击多降低11%的准确率，并展示了设计攻击的未开发潜力。

Conclusion: EvA是一种简单有效的攻击方法，适用于非可微目标，显著提升了攻击效果。

Abstract: Even a slight perturbation in the graph structure can cause a significant
drop in the accuracy of graph neural networks (GNNs). Most existing attacks
leverage gradient information to perturb edges. This relaxes the attack's
optimization problem from a discrete to a continuous space, resulting in
solutions far from optimal. It also restricts the adaptability of the attack to
non-differentiable objectives. Instead, we introduce a few simple yet effective
enhancements of an evolutionary-based algorithm to solve the discrete
optimization problem directly. Our Evolutionary Attack (EvA) works with any
black-box model and objective, eliminating the need for a differentiable proxy
loss. This allows us to design two novel attacks that reduce the effectiveness
of robustness certificates and break conformal sets. The memory complexity of
our attack is linear in the attack budget. Among our experiments, EvA shows
$\sim$11\% additional drop in accuracy on average compared to the best previous
attack, revealing significant untapped potential in designing attacks.

Conclusion: 结合因果发现与语言模型生成，有效辅助设施管理者诊断能耗问题。

Abstract: Smart buildings generate vast streams of sensor and control data, but
facility managers often lack clear explanations for anomalous energy usage. We
propose InsightBuild, a two-stage framework that integrates causality analysis
with a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) to provide human-readable, causal
explanations of energy consumption patterns. First, a lightweight causal
inference module applies Granger causality tests and structural causal
discovery on building telemetry (e.g., temperature, HVAC settings, occupancy)
drawn from Google Smart Buildings and Berkeley Office datasets. Next, an LLM,
fine-tuned on aligned pairs of sensor-level causes and textual explanations,
receives as input the detected causal relations and generates concise,
actionable explanations. We evaluate InsightBuild on two real-world datasets
(Google: 2017-2022; Berkeley: 2018-2020), using expert-annotated ground-truth
causes for a held-out set of anomalies. Our results demonstrate that combining
explicit causal discovery with LLM-based natural language generation yields
clear, precise explanations that assist facility managers in diagnosing and
mitigating energy inefficiencies.

Result: 在模拟和真实实验中，SPLASH显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SPLASH为从次优演示中学习复杂任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) presents a powerful paradigm for
learning complex robotic tasks from human demonstrations. However, most
approaches make the assumption that expert demonstrations are available, which
is often not the case. Those that allow for suboptimality in the demonstrations
are not designed for long-horizon goals or adversarial tasks. Many desirable
robot capabilities fall into one or both of these categories, thus highlighting
a critical shortcoming in the ability of IRL to produce field-ready robotic
agents. We introduce Sample-efficient Preference-based inverse reinforcement
learning for Long-horizon Adversarial tasks from Suboptimal Hierarchical
demonstrations (SPLASH), which advances the state-of-the-art in learning from
suboptimal demonstrations to long-horizon and adversarial settings. We
empirically validate SPLASH on a maritime capture-the-flag task in simulation,
and demonstrate real-world applicability with sim-to-real translation
experiments on autonomous unmanned surface vehicles. We show that our proposed
methods allow SPLASH to significantly outperform the state-of-the-art in reward
learning from suboptimal demonstrations.

Conclusion: 该方法解决了数据稀缺问题，对智能车辆系统和人机交互有重要价值。

Abstract: Human state detection and behavior prediction have seen significant
advancements with the rise of machine learning and multimodal sensing
technologies. However, predicting prosocial behavior intentions in mobility
scenarios, such as helping others on the road, is an underexplored area.
Current research faces a major limitation. There are no large, labeled datasets
available for prosocial behavior, and small-scale datasets make it difficult to
train deep-learning models effectively. To overcome this, we propose a
self-supervised learning approach that harnesses multi-modal data from existing
physiological and behavioral datasets. By pre-training our model on diverse
tasks and fine-tuning it with a smaller, manually labeled prosocial behavior
dataset, we significantly enhance its performance. This method addresses the
data scarcity issue, providing a more effective benchmark for prosocial
behavior prediction, and offering valuable insights for improving intelligent
vehicle systems and human-machine interaction.

Abstract: Estimating the score function (or other population-density-dependent
functions) is a fundamental component of most generative models. However, such
function estimation is computationally and statistically challenging. Can we
avoid function estimation for data generation? We propose an estimation-free
generative method: A set of points whose locations are deterministically
updated with (inverse) gradient descent can transport a uniform distribution to
arbitrary data distribution, in the mean field regime, without function
estimation, training neural networks, and even noise injection. The proposed
method is built upon recent advances in the physics of interacting particles.
We show, both theoretically and experimentally, that these advances can be
leveraged to develop novel generative methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 密度和几何是聚类算法设计的两大原则，但二者之间的交互常被忽视。本文旨在利用这种交互关系提升聚类性能。

Method: 框架通过选择关键区域应用简单算法，再通过多层传播过程扩展到完整数据集。

Result: 在15个数据集上测试，K-Means的ARI提升40%，GMM提升14%，性能优于现有算法。

Conclusion: CoreSPECT框架有效结合分布与几何特性，为聚类算法提供了新的增强思路。

Abstract: Density and geometry have long served as two of the fundamental guiding
principles in clustering algorithm design, with algorithm usually focusing
either on the density structure of the data (e.g., HDBSCAN and Density Peak
Clustering) or the complexity of underlying geometry (e.g., manifold clustering
algorithms).
  In this paper, we identify and formalize a recurring but often overlooked
interaction between distribution and geometry and leverage this insight to
design our clustering enhancement framework CoreSPECT (Core Space
Projection-based Enhancement of Clustering Techniques). Our framework boosts
the performance of simple algorithms like K-Means and GMM by applying them to
strategically selected regions, then extending the partial partition to a
complete partition for the dataset using a novel neighborhood graph based
multi-layer propagation procedure.
  We apply our framework on 15 datasets from three different domains and obtain
consistent and substantial gain in clustering accuracy for both K-Means and
GMM. On average, our framework improves the ARI of K-Means by 40% and of GMM by
14%, often surpassing the performance of both manifold-based and recent
density-based clustering algorithms. We further support our framework with
initial theoretical guarantees, ablation to demonstrate the usefulness of the
individual steps and with evidence of robustness to noise.

Conclusion: 量子增强表示在复杂数据填充任务中具有显著潜力。

Abstract: Missing data presents a critical challenge in real-world datasets,
significantly degrading the performance of machine learning models. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
tabular data imputation, exemplified by frameworks like UnIMP, their reliance
on classical embedding methods often limits their ability to capture complex,
non-linear correlations, particularly in mixed-type data scenarios encompassing
numerical, categorical, and textual features. This paper introduces
Quantum-UnIMP, a novel framework that integrates shallow quantum circuits into
an LLM-based imputation architecture. Our core innovation lies in replacing
conventional classical input embeddings with quantum feature maps generated by
an Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial (IQP) circuit. This approach enables the
model to leverage quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement,
thereby learning richer, more expressive representations of data and enhancing
the recovery of intricate missingness patterns. Our experiments on benchmark
mixed-type datasets demonstrate that Quantum-UnIMP reduces imputation error by
up to 15.2% for numerical features (RMSE) and improves classification accuracy
by 8.7% for categorical features (F1-Score) compared to state-of-the-art
classical and LLM-based methods. These compelling results underscore the
profound potential of quantum-enhanced representations for complex data
imputation tasks, even with near-term quantum hardware.

Abstract: Enhancing the mathematical reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a
pivotal challenge in advancing AI capabilities. While Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are the dominant training paradigms, a
systematic methodology for combining them to maximize both accuracy and
efficiency remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a practical and
effective training recipe that strategically integrates extended SFT with RL
from online inference (GRPO). We posit that these methods play complementary,
not competing, roles: a prolonged SFT phase first pushes the model's accuracy
to its limits, after which a GRPO phase dramatically improves token efficiency
while preserving this peak performance. Our experiments reveal that extending
SFT for as many as 10 epochs is crucial for performance breakthroughs, and that
the primary role of GRPO in this framework is to optimize solution length. The
efficacy of our recipe is rigorously validated through top-tier performance on
challenging benchmarks, including a high rank among over 2,200 teams in the
strictly leak-free AI Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO). This work provides the
community with a battle-tested blueprint for developing state-of-the-art
mathematical reasoners that are both exceptionally accurate and practically
efficient. To ensure full reproducibility and empower future research, we will
open-source our entire framework, including all code, model checkpoints, and
training configurations at

Abstract: Dimensional synthesis of planar four-bar mechanisms is a challenging inverse
problem in kinematics, requiring the determination of mechanism dimensions from
desired motion specifications. We propose a data-driven framework that bypasses
traditional equation-solving and optimization by leveraging supervised
learning. Our method combines a synthetic dataset, an LSTM-based neural network
for handling sequential precision points, and a Mixture of Experts (MoE)
architecture tailored to different linkage types. Each expert model is trained
on type-specific data and guided by a type-specifying layer, enabling both
single-type and multi-type synthesis. A novel simulation metric evaluates
prediction quality by comparing desired and generated motions. Experiments show
our approach produces accurate, defect-free linkages across various
configurations. This enables intuitive and efficient mechanism design, even for
non-expert users, and opens new possibilities for scalable and flexible
synthesis in kinematic design.

Abstract: We introduce a lightweight yet highly effective safety guardrail framework
for language models, demonstrating that small-scale language models can
achieve, and even surpass, the performance of larger counterparts in content
moderation tasks. This is accomplished through high-fidelity synthetic data
generation and adversarial training. The synthetic data generation process
begins with human-curated seed data, which undergoes query augmentation and
paraphrasing to create diverse and contextually rich examples. This augmented
data is then subjected to multiple rounds of curation, ensuring high fidelity
and relevance. Inspired by recent advances in the Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) architecture, our adversarial training employs reinforcement
learning to guide a generator that produces challenging synthetic examples.
These examples are used to fine-tune the safety classifier, enhancing its
ability to detect and mitigate harmful content. Additionally, we incorporate
strategies from recent research on efficient LLM training, leveraging the
capabilities of smaller models to improve the performance of larger generative
models. With iterative adversarial training and the generation of diverse,
high-quality synthetic data, our framework enables small language models (SLMs)
to serve as robust safety guardrails. This approach not only reduces
computational overhead but also enhances resilience against adversarial
attacks, offering a scalable and efficient solution for content moderation in
AI systems.

Abstract: Accurate workload prediction and advanced resource reservation are
indispensably crucial for managing dynamic cloud services. Traditional neural
networks and deep learning models frequently encounter challenges with diverse,
high-dimensional workloads, especially during sudden resource demand changes,
leading to inefficiencies. This issue arises from their limited optimization
during training, relying only on parametric (inter-connection weights)
adjustments using conventional algorithms. To address this issue, this work
proposes a novel Comprehensively Adaptive Architectural Optimization-based
Variable Quantum Neural Network (CA-QNN), which combines the efficiency of
quantum computing with complete structural and qubit vector parametric
learning. The model converts workload data into qubits, processed through qubit
neurons with Controlled NOT-gated activation functions for intuitive pattern
recognition. In addition, a comprehensive architecture optimization algorithm
for networks is introduced to facilitate the learning and propagation of the
structure and parametric values in variable-sized QNNs. This algorithm
incorporates quantum adaptive modulation and size-adaptive recombination during
training process. The performance of CA-QNN model is thoroughly investigated
against seven state-of-the-art methods across four benchmark datasets of
heterogeneous cloud workloads. The proposed model demonstrates superior
prediction accuracy, reducing prediction errors by up to 93.40% and 91.27%
compared to existing deep learning and QNN-based approaches.

Conclusion: scE2TM为单细胞RNA-seq数据分析提供了高质量的嵌入和强解释性，有助于揭示生物学机制。

Abstract: Recent advances in sequencing technologies have enabled researchers to
explore cellular heterogeneity at single-cell resolution. Meanwhile,
interpretability has gained prominence parallel to the rapid increase in the
complexity and performance of deep learning models. In recent years, topic
models have been widely used for interpretable single-cell embedding learning
and clustering analysis, which we refer to as single-cell embedded topic
models. However, previous studies evaluated the interpretability of the models
mainly through qualitative analysis, and these single-cell embedded topic
models suffer from the potential problem of interpretation collapse.
Furthermore, their neglect of external biological knowledge constrains
analytical performance. Here, we present scE2TM, an external knowledge-guided
single-cell embedded topic model that provides a high-quality cell embedding
and strong interpretation, contributing to comprehensive scRNA-seq data
analysis. Our comprehensive evaluation across 20 scRNA-seq datasets
demonstrates that scE2TM achieves significant clustering performance gains
compared to 7 state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we propose a new
interpretability evaluation benchmark that introduces 10 metrics to
quantitatively assess the interpretability of single-cell embedded topic
models. The results show that the interpretation provided by scE2TM performs
encouragingly in terms of diversity and consistency with the underlying
biological signals, contributing to a better revealing of the underlying
biological mechanisms.

Abstract: Efficient planning, resource management, and consistent operations often rely
on converting textual process documents into formal Business Process Model and
Notation (BPMN) models. However, this conversion process remains time-intensive
and costly. Existing approaches, whether rule-based or machine-learning-based,
still struggle with writing styles and often fail to identify parallel
structures in process descriptions.
  This paper introduces an automated pipeline for extracting BPMN models from
text, leveraging the use of machine learning and large language models. A key
contribution of this work is the introduction of a newly annotated dataset,
which significantly enhances the training process. Specifically, we augment the
PET dataset with 15 newly annotated documents containing 32 parallel gateways
for model training, a critical feature often overlooked in existing datasets.
This addition enables models to better capture parallel structures, a common
but complex aspect of process descriptions. The proposed approach demonstrates
adequate performance in terms of reconstruction accuracy, offering a promising
foundation for organizations to accelerate BPMN model creation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前车变道对自动驾驶车辆的运动规划有重要影响，预测变道意图可提升安全性和效率。现有研究多关注特定时间点的预测，而缺乏对时间区间内变道意图的预测及不同网络架构的比较。

Method: 使用公开数据集highD，设计并实现了LSTM、CNN和Transformer网络，比较了不同输入配置下的性能。

Result: Transformer网络表现最优，准确率在82.79%至96.73%之间，且抗过拟合能力更强。

Conclusion: Transformer网络在预测变道意图方面优于LSTM和CNN，具有较高的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Lane changes of preceding vehicles have a great impact on the motion planning
of automated vehicles especially in complex traffic situations. Predicting them
would benefit the public in terms of safety and efficiency. While many research
efforts have been made in this direction, few concentrated on predicting
maneuvers within a set time interval compared to predicting at a set prediction
time. In addition, there exist a lack of comparisons between different
architectures to try to determine the best performing one and to assess how to
correctly choose the input for such models. In this paper the structure of an
LSTM, a CNN and a Transformer network are described and implemented to predict
the intention of human drivers to perform a lane change. We show how the data
was prepared starting from a publicly available dataset (highD), which features
were used, how the networks were designed and finally we compare the results of
the three networks with different configurations of input data. We found that
transformer networks performed better than the other networks and was less
affected by overfitting. The accuracy of the method spanned from $82.79\%$ to
$96.73\%$ for different input configurations and showed overall good
performances considering also precision and recall.

Motivation: 探索量子机器学习如何利用量子计算优势解决经典机器学习在处理复杂数据集时的计算瓶颈问题。

Method: 介绍了QML的理论基础，包括量子数据编码、量子学习理论和优化技术，并根据数据类型和计算架构对QML方法进行分类。

Result: QML在量子化学和传感等特定应用中具有潜力，但其广泛实用性仍受限于技术和方法上的挑战。

Conclusion: QML虽在特定领域有前景，但需克服NISQ设备的噪声、可扩展性等问题，并开发量子原生算法和更优的错误校正方法，以实现实际应用。

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) represents a promising frontier at the
intersection of quantum computing and artificial intelligence, aiming to
leverage quantum computational advantages to enhance data-driven tasks. This
review explores the potential of QML to address the computational bottlenecks
of classical machine learning, particularly in processing complex datasets. We
introduce the theoretical foundations of QML, including quantum data encoding,
quantum learning theory and optimization techniques, while categorizing QML
approaches based on data type and computational architecture. It is
well-established that quantum computational advantages are problem-dependent,
and so potentially useful directions for QML need to be systematically
identified. Key developments, such as Quantum Principal Component Analysis,
quantum-enhanced sensing and applications in material science, are critically
evaluated for their theoretical speed-ups and practical limitations. The
challenges posed by Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, including
hardware noise, scalability constraints and data encoding overheads, are
discussed in detail. We also outline future directions, emphasizing the need
for quantum-native algorithms, improved error correction, and realistic
benchmarks to bridge the gap between theoretical promise and practical
deployment. This comprehensive analysis underscores that while QML has
significant potential for specific applications such as quantum chemistry and
sensing, its broader utility in real-world scenarios remains contingent on
overcoming technological and methodological hurdles.

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著降低了I类错误率，并在树状可解释聚类和基于显著性的层次聚类中得到验证。

Conclusion: 两簇检验是一个与两样本检验不同的显著性测试问题，新方法在实际应用中表现出色。

Abstract: Cluster analysis is a fundamental research issue in statistics and machine
learning. In many modern clustering methods, we need to determine whether two
subsets of samples come from the same cluster. Since these subsets are usually
generated by certain clustering procedures, the deployment of classic
two-sample tests in this context would yield extremely smaller p-values,
leading to inflated Type-I error rate. To overcome this bias, we formally
introduce the two-cluster test issue and argue that it is a totally different
significance testing issue from conventional two-sample test. Meanwhile, we
present a new method based on the boundary points between two subsets to derive
an analytical p-value for the purpose of significance quantification.
Experiments on both synthetic and real data sets show that the proposed test is
able to significantly reduce the Type-I error rate, in comparison with several
classic two-sample testing methods. More importantly, the practical usage of
such two-cluster test is further verified through its applications in
tree-based interpretable clustering and significance-based hierarchical
clustering.

Motivation: 离线预训练的智能体在在线微调时由于分布偏移导致价值估计不准确，甚至随机初始化在某些情况下表现更好，因此需要一种新方法解决这一问题。

Method: 提出OPT方法，引入在线预训练阶段，专门训练一个适用于在线微调的新价值函数。

Conclusion: OPT通过在线预训练有效解决了离线预训练智能体在在线微调时的价值估计问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Offline-to-online reinforcement learning (RL) aims to integrate the
complementary strengths of offline and online RL by pre-training an agent
offline and subsequently fine-tuning it through online interactions. However,
recent studies reveal that offline pre-trained agents often underperform during
online fine-tuning due to inaccurate value estimation caused by distribution
shift, with random initialization proving more effective in certain cases. In
this work, we propose a novel method, Online Pre-Training for Offline-to-Online
RL (OPT), explicitly designed to address the issue of inaccurate value
estimation in offline pre-trained agents. OPT introduces a new learning phase,
Online Pre-Training, which allows the training of a new value function tailored
specifically for effective online fine-tuning. Implementation of OPT on TD3 and
SPOT demonstrates an average 30% improvement in performance across a wide range
of D4RL environments, including MuJoCo, Antmaze, and Adroit.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for language
modeling, rivaling auto-regressive models by training-time scaling. However,
inference-time scaling in discrete diffusion models remains relatively
under-explored. In this work, we study sampling-based approaches for achieving
high-quality text generation from discrete diffusion models in reward-guided
settings. We introduce a novel inference-time scaling approach based on
particle Gibbs sampling for discrete diffusion models. The particle Gibbs
sampling algorithm iteratively refines full diffusion trajectories using
conditional Sequential Monte Carlo as its transition mechanism. This process
ensures that the updated samples progressively improve and move closer to the
reward-weighted target distribution. Unlike existing inference-time scaling
methods, which are often limited to single diffusion trajectories, our approach
leverages iterative refinement across multiple trajectories. Within this
framework, we further analyze the trade-offs between four key axes for
inference-time scaling under fixed compute budgets: particle Gibbs iterations,
particle count, denoising steps, and reward estimation cost. Empirically, our
method consistently outperforms prior inference-time strategies on
reward-guided text generation tasks, achieving significant improvement in
accuracy under varying compute budgets.

Conclusion: RTNinja为随机电报噪声分析提供了稳健、可扩展且设备无关的工具，适用于大规模统计分析和可靠性评估。

Abstract: Random telegraph noise is a prevalent variability phenomenon in
nanoelectronic devices, arising from stochastic carrier exchange at defect
sites and critically impacting device reliability and performance. Conventional
analysis techniques often rely on restrictive assumptions or manual
interventions, limiting their applicability to complex, noisy datasets. Here,
we introduce RTNinja, a generalized, fully automated machine learning framework
for the unsupervised analysis of random telegraph noise signals. RTNinja
deconvolves complex signals to identify the number and characteristics of
hidden individual sources, without requiring prior knowledge of the system. The
framework comprises two modular components: LevelsExtractor, which uses
Bayesian inference and model selection to denoise and discretize the signal;
and SourcesMapper, which infers source configurations through probabilistic
clustering and optimization. To evaluate performance, we developed a Monte
Carlo simulator that generates labeled datasets spanning broad signal-to-noise
ratios and source complexities; across 7000 such datasets, RTNinja consistently
demonstrated high-fidelity signal reconstruction and accurate extraction of
source amplitudes and activity patterns. Our results demonstrate that RTNinja
offers a robust, scalable, and device-agnostic tool for random telegraph noise
characterization, enabling large-scale statistical benchmarking,
reliability-centric technology qualification, predictive failure modeling, and
device physics exploration in next-generation nanoelectronics.

Result: 实验分析了系统对不同扰动方法的敏感性、图谱组件重要性与其结构位置的关系等。

Conclusion: KGRAG-Ex通过知识图谱显著提升了RAG系统的可解释性和事实基础。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances language models by grounding
responses in external information, yet explainability remains a critical
challenge, particularly when retrieval relies on unstructured text. Knowledge
graphs (KGs) offer a solution by introducing structured, semantically rich
representations of entities and their relationships, enabling transparent
retrieval paths and interpretable reasoning. In this work, we present KGRAG-Ex,
a RAG system that improves both factual grounding and explainability by
leveraging a domain-specific KG constructed via prompt-based information
extraction. Given a user query, KGRAG-Ex identifies relevant entities and
semantic paths in the graph, which are then transformed into pseudo-paragraphs:
natural language representations of graph substructures that guide corpus
retrieval. To improve interpretability and support reasoning transparency, we
incorporate perturbation-based explanation methods that assess the influence of
specific KG-derived components on the generated answers. We conduct a series of
experiments to analyze the sensitivity of the system to different perturbation
methods, the relationship between graph component importance and their
structural positions, the influence of semantic node types, and how graph
metrics correspond to the influence of components within the explanations
process.

Result: 理论证明RSS估计的经验损失方差小于SRS，实验在12个基准数据集上验证了RSS-MLP的优越性。

Conclusion: RSS-MLP通过有序采样有效减少方差，提升了MLP的性能，实验和理论分析均支持其有效性。

Abstract: Multilayer perceptron (MLP), one of the most fundamental neural networks, is
extensively utilized for classification and regression tasks. In this paper, we
establish a new generalization error bound, which reveals how the variance of
empirical loss influences the generalization ability of the learning model.
Inspired by this learning bound, we advocate to reduce the variance of
empirical loss to enhance the ability of MLP. As is well-known, bagging is a
popular ensemble method to realize variance reduction. However, bagging
produces the base training data sets by the Simple Random Sampling (SRS)
method, which exhibits a high degree of randomness. To handle this issue, we
introduce an ordered structure in the training data set by Rank Set Sampling
(RSS) to further reduce the variance of loss and develop a RSS-MLP method.
Theoretical results show that the variance of empirical exponential loss and
the logistic loss estimated by RSS are smaller than those estimated by SRS,
respectively. To validate the performance of RSS-MLP, we conduct comparison
experiments on twelve benchmark data sets in terms of the two convex loss
functions under two fusion methods. Extensive experimental results and analysis
illustrate the effectiveness and rationality of the propose method.

Result: Sophia训练损失最低，Lion速度最快，AdamW在下游任务中表现最好。

Conclusion: 不同优化器各有优势，选择需根据具体需求权衡速度和性能。

Abstract: Optimizers play a decisive role in reducing pre-training times for LLMs and
achieving better-performing models. In this study, we compare three major
variants: the de-facto standard AdamW, the simpler Lion, developed through an
evolutionary search, and the second-order optimizer Sophia. For better
generalization, we train with two different base architectures and use a
single- and a multiple-epoch approach while keeping the number of tokens
constant. Using the Maximal Update Parametrization and smaller proxy models, we
tune relevant hyperparameters separately for each combination of base
architecture and optimizer. We found that while the results from all three
optimizers were in approximately the same range, Sophia exhibited the lowest
training and validation loss, Lion was fastest in terms of training GPU hours
but AdamW led to the best downstream evaluation results.

Result: 新方法提供了更直接且标准化的评估，并与人类评估结果进行了对比。

Conclusion: 为改进稀疏编码器可解释性评估提供了建议，促进了标准化评估的发展。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and transcoders have become important tools for
machine learning interpretability. However, measuring how interpretable they
are remains challenging, with weak consensus about which benchmarks to use.
Most evaluation procedures start by producing a single-sentence explanation for
each latent. These explanations are then evaluated based on how well they
enable an LLM to predict the activation of a latent in new contexts. This
method makes it difficult to disentangle the explanation generation and
evaluation process from the actual interpretability of the latents discovered.
In this work, we adapt existing methods to assess the interpretability of
sparse coders, with the advantage that they do not require generating natural
language explanations as an intermediate step. This enables a more direct and
potentially standardized assessment of interpretability. Furthermore, we
compare the scores produced by our interpretability metrics with human
evaluations across similar tasks and varying setups, offering suggestions for
the community on improving the evaluation of these techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 化学反应的本质是电子的重新分布和重组，通常表现为电子转移或电子对的迁移。这些变化在物理世界中是离散且突变的，因此需要一种能够准确建模状态转换的方法。

Method: SynBridge采用图到图变换网络架构和离散流桥技术，通过原子和键的离散状态捕捉反应物和产物之间的双向化学转化。

Result: 在三个基准数据集（USPTO-50K、USPTO-MIT、Pistachio）上的实验表明，SynBridge在正向和逆向合成任务中均达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 结构化扩散在离散空间中对反应预测具有显著优势，SynBridge为化学反应的建模提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The essence of a chemical reaction lies in the redistribution and
reorganization of electrons, which is often manifested through electron
transfer or the migration of electron pairs. These changes are inherently
discrete and abrupt in the physical world, such as alterations in the charge
states of atoms or the formation and breaking of chemical bonds. To model the
transition of states, we propose SynBridge, a bidirectional flow-based
generative model to achieve multi-task reaction prediction. By leveraging a
graph-to-graph transformer network architecture and discrete flow bridges
between any two discrete distributions, SynBridge captures bidirectional
chemical transformations between graphs of reactants and products through the
bonds' and atoms' discrete states. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method through extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
(USPTO-50K, USPTO-MIT, Pistachio), achieving state-of-the-art performance in
both forward and retrosynthesis tasks. Our ablation studies and noise
scheduling analysis reveal the benefits of structured diffusion over discrete
spaces for reaction prediction.

limitations and energy inefficiency, especially for real-time applications.
This study provides a comprehensive survey of deployment frameworks for VLMs on
mobile devices, evaluating llama.cpp, MLC-Imp, and mllm in the context of
running LLaVA-1.5 7B, MobileVLM-3B, and Imp-v1.5 3B as representative workloads
on a OnePlus 13R. Each deployment framework was evaluated on the OnePlus 13R
while running VLMs, with measurements covering CPU, GPU, and NPU utilization,
temperature, inference time, power consumption, and user experience.
Benchmarking revealed critical performance bottlenecks across frameworks: CPU
resources were consistently over-utilized during token generation, while GPU
and NPU accelerators were largely unused. When the GPU was used, primarily for
image feature extraction, it was saturated, leading to degraded device
responsiveness. The study contributes framework-level benchmarks, practical
profiling tools, and an in-depth analysis of hardware utilization bottlenecks,
highlighting the consistent overuse of CPUs and the ineffective or unstable use
of GPUs and NPUs in current deployment frameworks.

Motivation: 解决SFL在异构环境中因灾难性遗忘导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 提出SFedKD框架，采用多教师知识蒸馏，根据类别分布差异分配权重，并设计教师选择机制以减少冗余。

Result: SFedKD显著缓解了灾难性遗忘，并在实验中优于现有FL方法。

Conclusion: SFedKD通过多教师知识蒸馏和教师选择机制，有效提升了SFL的性能和稳定性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm which
coordinates multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model via a
central server. Sequential Federated Learning (SFL) is a newly-emerging FL
training framework where the global model is trained in a sequential manner
across clients. Since SFL can provide strong convergence guarantees under data
heterogeneity, it has attracted significant research attention in recent years.
However, experiments show that SFL suffers from severe catastrophic forgetting
in heterogeneous environments, meaning that the model tends to forget knowledge
learned from previous clients. To address this issue, we propose an SFL
framework with discrepancy-aware multi-teacher knowledge distillation, called
SFedKD, which selects multiple models from the previous round to guide the
current round of training. In SFedKD, we extend the single-teacher Decoupled
Knowledge Distillation approach to our multi-teacher setting and assign
distinct weights to teachers' target-class and non-target-class knowledge based
on the class distributional discrepancy between teacher and student data.
Through this fine-grained weighting strategy, SFedKD can enhance model training
efficacy while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, to prevent
knowledge dilution, we eliminate redundant teachers for the knowledge
distillation and formalize it as a variant of the maximum coverage problem.
Based on the greedy strategy, we design a complementary-based teacher selection
mechanism to ensure that the selected teachers achieve comprehensive knowledge
space coverage while reducing communication and computational costs. Extensive
experiments show that SFedKD effectively overcomes catastrophic forgetting in
SFL and outperforms state-of-the-art FL methods.

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效优化多样目标，适用于确定性和随机性场景，并与值函数和演员-评论家算法无缝集成。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了灵活性和实际应用潜力，为复杂目标的行为对齐提供了新思路。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), aligning agent behavior with specific
objectives typically requires careful design of the reward function, which can
be challenging when the desired objectives are complex. In this work, we
propose an alternative approach for flexible behavior alignment that eliminates
the need to modify the reward function by selecting appropriate reward
aggregation functions. By introducing an algebraic perspective on Markov
decision processes (MDPs), we show that the Bellman equations naturally emerge
from the recursive generation and aggregation of rewards, allowing for the
generalization of the standard discounted sum to other recursive aggregations,
such as discounted max and Sharpe ratio. Our approach applies to both
deterministic and stochastic settings and integrates seamlessly with
value-based and actor-critic algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach effectively optimizes diverse objectives, highlighting its
versatility and potential for real-world applications.

high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data combined with alignment-based
algorithms that detect back-splicing signals. However, these methods face
several limitations: they can't predict circRNAs directly from genomic DNA
sequences and relies heavily on RNA experimental data; they involve high
computational costs due to complex alignment and filtering steps; and they are
inefficient for large-scale or genome-wide circRNA prediction. The challenge is
even greater in plants, where plant circRNA splice sites often lack the
canonical GT-AG motif seen in human mRNA splicing, and no efficient deep
learning model with strong generalization capability currently exists.
Furthermore, the number of currently identified plant circRNAs is likely far
lower than their true abundance. In this paper, we propose a deep learning
framework named CircFormerMoE based on transformers and mixture-of experts for
predicting circRNAs directly from plant genomic DNA. Our framework consists of
two subtasks known as splicing site detection (SSD) and splicing site pairing
(SSP). The model's effectiveness has been validated on gene data of 10 plant
species. Trained on known circRNA instances, it is also capable of discovering
previously unannotated circRNAs. In addition, we performed interpretability
analyses on the trained model to investigate the sequence patterns contributing
to its predictions. Our framework provides a fast and accurate computational
method and tool for large-scale circRNA discovery in plants, laying a
foundation for future research in plant functional genomics and non-coding RNA
annotation.

Conclusion: 该框架提供了可解释的风险感知预测，有助于增强自动驾驶系统的决策鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate vehicle trajectory prediction is essential for ensuring safety and
efficiency in fully autonomous driving systems. While existing methods
primarily focus on modeling observed motion patterns and interactions with
other vehicles, they often neglect the potential risks posed by the uncertain
or aggressive behaviors of surrounding vehicles. In this paper, we propose a
novel spatial-temporal risk-attentive trajectory prediction framework that
incorporates a risk potential field to assess perceived risks arising from
behaviors of nearby vehicles. The framework leverages a spatial-temporal
encoder and a risk-attentive feature fusion decoder to embed the risk potential
field into the extracted spatial-temporal feature representations for
trajectory prediction. A risk-scaled loss function is further designed to
improve the prediction accuracy of high-risk scenarios, such as short relative
spacing. Experiments on the widely used NGSIM and HighD datasets demonstrate
that our method reduces average prediction errors by 4.8% and 31.2%
respectively compared to state-of-the-art approaches, especially in high-risk
scenarios. The proposed framework provides interpretable, risk-aware
predictions, contributing to more robust decision-making for autonomous driving
systems.

TL;DR: AbbIE是一种新型递归Transformer编码器，通过动态调整计算资源在测试时提升性能，优于标准Transformer和其他迭代方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索一种无需增加参数或数据量即可提升Transformer性能的方法，同时支持测试时动态计算资源分配。

Method: 采用递归的块式迭代编码器，在潜在空间进行迭代，无需特殊数据集或训练协议。

Result: AbbIE在零样本上下文学习任务中提升12%，语言困惑度提升5%，且能向上泛化。

Conclusion: AbbIE为Transformer性能扩展提供了新途径，尤其在动态计算资源分配方面表现出色。

Abstract: We introduce the Autoregressive Block-Based Iterative Encoder (AbbIE), a
novel recursive generalization of the encoder-only Transformer architecture,
which achieves better perplexity than a standard Transformer and allows for the
dynamic scaling of compute resources at test time. This simple, recursive
approach is a complement to scaling large language model (LLM) performance
through parameter and token counts. AbbIE performs its iterations in latent
space, but unlike latent reasoning models, does not require a specialized
dataset or training protocol. We show that AbbIE upward generalizes (ability to
generalize to arbitrary iteration lengths) at test time by only using 2
iterations during train time, far outperforming alternative iterative methods.
AbbIE's ability to scale its computational expenditure based on the complexity
of the task gives it an up to \textbf{12\%} improvement in zero-shot in-context
learning tasks versus other iterative and standard methods and up to 5\%
improvement in language perplexity. The results from this study open a new
avenue to Transformer performance scaling. We perform all of our evaluations on
model sizes up to 350M parameters.

Result: 在五个不同恶意软件检测数据集上的实验表明，ADAPT性能优于基线模型和竞争基准。

Conclusion: ADAPT为恶意软件检测中概念漂移的适应提供了更有效的方法。

Abstract: Machine learning models are commonly used for malware classification;
however, they suffer from performance degradation over time due to concept
drift. Adapting these models to changing data distributions requires frequent
updates, which rely on costly ground truth annotations. While active learning
can reduce the annotation burden, leveraging unlabeled data through
semi-supervised learning remains a relatively underexplored approach in the
context of malware detection. In this research, we introduce \texttt{ADAPT}, a
novel pseudo-labeling semi-supervised algorithm for addressing concept drift.
Our model-agnostic method can be applied to various machine learning models,
including neural networks and tree-based algorithms. We conduct extensive
experiments on five diverse malware detection datasets spanning Android,
Windows, and PDF domains. The results demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms baseline models and competitive benchmarks. This work paves the way
for more effective adaptation of machine learning models to concept drift in
malware detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水稻种植消耗大量淡水，而可持续灌溉实践（如DSR和AWD）可显著减少用水量，但缺乏相关数据支持政策制定。

Method: 利用Sentinel-1卫星影像和地面数据，开发分类系统，区分不同灌溉实践。

Result: 模型在区分DSR与传统水稻种植方面达到78% F1分数，并成功应用于300万农田地块的DSR采用率测绘。

Conclusion: 该研究为政策制定者提供了监测可持续灌溉实践的工具，支持精准干预和项目评估。

Abstract: Rice cultivation consumes 24-30% of global freshwater, creating critical
water management challenges in major rice-producing regions. Sustainable
irrigation practices like direct seeded rice (DSR) and alternate wetting and
drying (AWD) can reduce water use by 20-40% while maintaining yields, helping
secure long-term agricultural productivity as water scarcity intensifies - a
key component of the Zero Hunger Sustainable Development Goal. However, limited
data on adoption rates of these practices prevents evidence-based policymaking
and targeted resource allocation. We developed a novel remote sensing framework
to monitor sustainable water management practices at scale in Punjab, India - a
region facing severe groundwater depletion of 41.6 cm/year. To collect
essential ground truth data, we partnered with the Nature Conservancy's
Promoting Regenerative and No-burn Agriculture (PRANA) program, which trained
approximately 1,400 farmers on water-saving techniques while documenting their
field-level practices. Using this data, we created a classification system with
Sentinel-1 satellite imagery that separates water management along sowing and
irrigation dimensions. Our approach achieved a 78% F1-score in distinguishing
DSR from traditional puddled transplanted rice without requiring prior
knowledge of planting dates. We demonstrated scalability by mapping DSR
adoption across approximately 3 million agricultural plots in Punjab, with
district-level predictions showing strong correlation (Pearson=0.77, RBO= 0.77)
with government records. This study provides policymakers with a powerful tool
to track sustainable water management adoption, target interventions, and
measure program impacts at scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有标注数据集已被用于训练大型视觉语言模型（VLMs），改进性能具有挑战性，因此探索无监督图像描述性能。

Method: 使用多智能体强化学习游戏（LoGIC），包含‘说话者’和‘倾听者’两个代理，通过GRPO算法训练，利用预训练VLMs和LLMs。

Result: 在无监督设置下，LoGIC实现了46 BLEU分数，比基线VLM高2分；轻量级组件版本在无监督设置下达到31 BLEU分数，优于现有方法10分。

Conclusion: LoGIC方法在无监督图像描述任务中表现优异，为改进性能提供了新思路。

Abstract: Image captioning is an important problem in developing various AI systems,
and these tasks require large volumes of annotated images to train the models.
Since all existing labelled datasets are already used for training the large
Vision Language Models (VLMs), it becomes challenging to improve the
performance of the same. Considering this, it is essential to consider the
unsupervised image captioning performance, which remains relatively
under-explored. To that end, we propose LoGIC (Lewis Communication Game for
Image Captioning), a Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning game. The proposed
method consists of two agents, a 'speaker' and a 'listener', with the objective
of learning a strategy for communicating in natural language. We train agents
in the cooperative common-reward setting using the GRPO algorithm and show that
improvement in image captioning performance emerges as a consequence of the
agents learning to play the game. We show that using pre-trained VLMs as the
'speaker' and Large Language Model (LLM) for language understanding in the
'listener', we achieved a $46$ BLEU score after fine-tuning using LoGIC without
additional labels, a $2$ units advantage in absolute metrics compared to the
$44$ BLEU score of the vanilla VLM. Additionally, we replace the VLM from the
'speaker' with lightweight components: (i) a ViT for image perception and (ii)
a GPT2 language generation, and train them from scratch using LoGIC, obtaining
a $31$ BLEU score in the unsupervised setting, a $10$ points advantage over
existing unsupervised image-captioning methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了不平衡协变量偏移这一复杂异质性，FedAKD旨在平衡准确预测与协作公平性。

Method: FedAKD包括客户端和服务器更新：客户端使用异步知识蒸馏策略，服务器聚合模型并更新全局模型。

Result: 实验显示FedAKD在FashionMNIST、CIFAR10和EHR数据集上显著提升公平性和准确性。

Conclusion: FedAKD有效解决了不平衡协变量偏移问题，增强了协作公平性和模型性能。

Abstract: Collaborative fairness is a crucial challenge in federated learning. However,
existing approaches often overlook a practical yet complex form of
heterogeneity: imbalanced covariate shift. We provide a theoretical analysis of
this setting, which motivates the design of FedAKD (Federated Asynchronous
Knowledge Distillation)- simple yet effective approach that balances accurate
prediction with collaborative fairness. FedAKD consists of client and server
updates. In the client update, we introduce a novel asynchronous knowledge
distillation strategy based on our preliminary analysis, which reveals that
while correctly predicted samples exhibit similar feature distributions across
clients, incorrectly predicted samples show significant variability. This
suggests that imbalanced covariate shift primarily arises from misclassified
samples. Leveraging this insight, our approach first applies traditional
knowledge distillation to update client models while keeping the global model
fixed. Next, we select correctly predicted high-confidence samples and update
the global model using these samples while keeping client models fixed. The
server update simply aggregates all client models. We further provide a
theoretical proof of FedAKD's convergence. Experimental results on public
datasets (FashionMNIST and CIFAR10) and a real-world Electronic Health Records
(EHR) dataset demonstrate that FedAKD significantly improves collaborative
fairness, enhances predictive accuracy, and fosters client participation even
under highly heterogeneous data distributions.

TL;DR: WERSA是一种线性时间复杂度的注意力机制，显著降低长序列处理的计算成本，同时保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer模型在长序列上计算复杂度高的问题，提供高效且性能不降的解决方案。

Method: 结合内容自适应的随机谱特征、多分辨率Haar小波和可学习参数，实现线性效率的选择性注意力。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现最佳，显著减少训练时间和计算资源，同时提升准确性。

Conclusion: WERSA为长上下文模型提供了更实用、经济且可持续的解决方案。

Abstract: Transformer models are computationally costly on long sequences since regular
attention has quadratic $O(n^2)$ time complexity. We introduce Wavelet-Enhanced
Random Spectral Attention (WERSA), a novel mechanism of linear $O(n)$ time
complexity that is pivotal to enable successful long-sequence processing
without the performance trade-off. WERSA merges content-adaptive random
spectral features together with multi-resolution Haar wavelets and learnable
parameters to selectively attend to informative scales of data while preserving
linear efficiency.
  Large-scale comparisons \textbf{on single GPU} and across various benchmarks
(vision, NLP, hierarchical reasoning) and various attention mechanisms (like
Multiheaded Attention, Flash-Attention-2, FNet, Linformer, Performer,
Waveformer), reveal uniform advantages of WERSA. It achieves best accuracy in
all tests. On ArXiv classification, WERSA improves accuracy over vanilla
attention by 1.2\% (86.2\% vs 85.0\%) while cutting training time by 81\% (296s
vs 1554s) and FLOPS by 73.4\% (26.2G vs 98.4G). Significantly, WERSA excels
where vanilla and FlashAttention-2 fail: on ArXiv-128k's extremely lengthy
sequences, it achieves best accuracy (79.1\%) and AUC (0.979) among viable
methods, operating on data that gives Out-Of-Memory errors to quadratic methods
while being \textbf{twice as fast} as Waveformer, its next-best competitor.
  By significantly reducing computational loads without compromising accuracy,
WERSA makes possible more practical, more affordable, long-context models, in
particular on low-resource hardware, for more sustainable and more scalable AI
development.

Motivation: 传统理论认为模型容量增加会导致过拟合，但实践中很少见全局过拟合。作者假设过拟合可能发生在数据空间的局部区域，并探索其与双下降现象的关系。

Method: 提出一种衡量验证数据遗忘率的分数，捕捉局部过拟合。通过两阶段方法：集成多个检查点，再蒸馏为单一模型。

Result: 在多个数据集和架构上验证了方法的有效性，尤其在标签噪声下表现优于原始模型和独立训练的集成模型。

Conclusion: 局部过拟合是存在的，且可通过知识融合和蒸馏方法有效缓解，实现训练和推理复杂度的双赢。

Abstract: Overfitting in deep neural networks occurs less frequently than expected.
This is a puzzling observation, as theory predicts that greater model capacity
should eventually lead to overfitting -- yet this is rarely seen in practice.
But what if overfitting does occur, not globally, but in specific sub-regions
of the data space? In this work, we introduce a novel score that measures the
forgetting rate of deep models on validation data, capturing what we term local
overfitting: a performance degradation confined to certain regions of the input
space. We demonstrate that local overfitting can arise even without
conventional overfitting, and is closely linked to the double descent
phenomenon.
  Building on these insights, we introduce a two-stage approach that leverages
the training history of a single model to recover and retain forgotten
knowledge: first, by aggregating checkpoints into an ensemble, and then by
distilling it into a single model of the original size, thus enhancing
performance without added inference cost.
  Extensive experiments across multiple datasets, modern architectures, and
training regimes validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, in the
presence of label noise, our method -- Knowledge Fusion followed by Knowledge
Distillation -- outperforms both the original model and independently trained
ensembles, achieving a rare win-win scenario: reduced training and inference
complexity.

Conclusion: 研究表明，缺乏领域知识约束的数据驱动优化可能提供不可行的解决方案，而MAD-OPT框架为热电厂安全采用AI提供了有效途径。

Abstract: The domain-consistent adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) remains low in
thermal power plants due to the black-box nature of AI algorithms and low
representation of domain knowledge in conventional data-centric analytics. In
this paper, we develop a MAhalanobis Distance-based OPTimization (MAD-OPT)
framework that incorporates the Mahalanobis distance-based constraint to
introduce domain knowledge into data-centric analytics. The developed MAD-OPT
framework is applied to maximize thermal efficiency and minimize turbine heat
rate for a 395 MW capacity gas turbine system. We demonstrate that the MAD-OPT
framework can estimate domain-informed optimal process conditions under
different ambient conditions, and the optimal solutions are found to be robust
as evaluated by Monte Carlo simulations. We also apply the MAD-OPT framework to
estimate optimal process conditions beyond the design power generation limit of
the gas turbine system, and have found comparable results with the actual data
of the power plant. We demonstrate that implementing data-centric optimization
analytics without incorporating domain-informed constraints may provide
ineffective solutions that may not be implementable in the real operation of
the gas turbine system. This research advances the integration of the
data-driven domain knowledge into machine learning-powered analytics that
enhances the domain-informed operation excellence and paves the way for safe AI
adoption in thermal power systems.

Result: 两种正则化技术可以部分替代，但精确组合对稳健性能至关重要。

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于推动更稳健的RL算法研究，特别是针对超参数敏感性。

Abstract: Policy Mirror Descent (PMD) has emerged as a unifying framework in
reinforcement learning (RL) by linking policy gradient methods with a
first-order optimization method known as mirror descent. At its core, PMD
incorporates two key regularization components: (i) a distance term that
enforces a trust region for stable policy updates and (ii) an MDP regularizer
that augments the reward function to promote structure and robustness. While
PMD has been extensively studied in theory, empirical investigations remain
scarce. This work provides a large-scale empirical analysis of the interplay
between these two regularization techniques, running over 500k training seeds
on small RL environments. Our results demonstrate that, although the two
regularizers can partially substitute each other, their precise combination is
critical for achieving robust performance. These findings highlight the
potential for advancing research on more robust algorithms in RL, particularly
with respect to hyperparameter sensitivity.

Result: 提出的框架在多种数据集、分布偏移类型和TTA方法中表现有效。

Conclusion: 结合TTA与风险监控可提升模型部署的鲁棒性，确保及时检测性能下降。

Abstract: Encountering shifted data at test time is a ubiquitous challenge when
deploying predictive models. Test-time adaptation (TTA) methods address this
issue by continuously adapting a deployed model using only unlabeled test data.
While TTA can extend the model's lifespan, it is only a temporary solution.
Eventually the model might degrade to the point that it must be taken offline
and retrained. To detect such points of ultimate failure, we propose pairing
TTA with risk monitoring frameworks that track predictive performance and raise
alerts when predefined performance criteria are violated. Specifically, we
extend existing monitoring tools based on sequential testing with confidence
sequences to accommodate scenarios in which the model is updated at test time
and no test labels are available to estimate the performance metrics of
interest. Our extensions unlock the application of rigorous statistical risk
monitoring to TTA, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed TTA
monitoring framework across a representative set of datasets, distribution
shift types, and TTA methods.

Result: 实验表明该方法在缓解灾难性遗忘和新任务性能之间取得了更好的平衡。

Conclusion: 该方法为灾难性遗忘问题提供了一种新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting in deep neural networks occurs when learning new
tasks degrades performance on previously learned tasks due to knowledge
overwriting. Among the approaches to mitigate this issue, regularization
techniques aim to identify and constrain "important" parameters to preserve
previous knowledge. In the highly nonconvex optimization landscape of deep
learning, we propose a novel perspective: tracking parameters during the final
training plateau is more effective than monitoring them throughout the entire
training process. We argue that parameters that exhibit higher activity
(movement and variability) during this plateau reveal directions in the loss
landscape that are relatively flat, making them suitable for adaptation to new
tasks while preserving knowledge from previous ones. Our comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that this approach achieves superior performance in
balancing catastrophic forgetting mitigation with strong performance on newly
learned tasks.

Motivation: 标准NVAR和RC在预测混沌系统时依赖固定非线性，适应性差且在高维场景下扩展性不佳。

Method: 结合延迟嵌入线性输入和可学习MLP，通过梯度优化联合训练，避免繁琐的参数搜索。

Result: 在混沌系统中，自适应模型在预测精度和噪声条件下的稳健性上优于标准NVAR。

Conclusion: 自适应NVAR模型在性能和扩展性上优于传统方法，适用于复杂和高噪声数据。

Abstract: Nonlinear vector autoregression (NVAR) and reservoir computing (RC) have
shown promise in forecasting chaotic dynamical systems, such as the Lorenz-63
model and El Nino-Southern Oscillation. However, their reliance on fixed
nonlinearities - polynomial expansions in NVAR or random feature maps in RC -
limits their adaptability to high noise or real-world data. These methods also
scale poorly in high-dimensional settings due to costly matrix inversion during
readout computation. We propose an adaptive NVAR model that combines
delay-embedded linear inputs with features generated by a shallow, learnable
multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The MLP and linear readout are jointly trained
using gradient-based optimization, enabling the model to learn data-driven
nonlinearities while preserving a simple readout structure. Unlike standard
NVAR, our approach avoids the need for an exhaustive and sensitive grid search
over ridge and delay parameters. Instead, tuning is restricted to neural
network hyperparameters, improving scalability. Initial experiments on chaotic
systems tested under noise-free and synthetically noisy conditions showed that
the adaptive model outperformed the standard NVAR in predictive accuracy and
showed robust forecasting under noisy conditions with a lower observation
frequency.

Conclusion: PHQFNO展示了量子-经典混合方法在科学机器学习中的优势，为未来分布式量子计算提供了可行方案。

Abstract: We introduce the Partitioned Hybrid Quantum Fourier Neural Operator (PHQFNO),
a generalization of the Quantum Fourier Neural Operator (QFNO) for scientific
machine learning. PHQFNO partitions the Fourier operator computation across
classical and quantum resources, enabling tunable quantum-classical
hybridization and distributed execution across quantum and classical devices.
The method extends QFNOs to higher dimensions and incorporates a
message-passing framework to distribute data across different partitions. Input
data are encoded into quantum states using unary encoding, and quantum circuit
parameters are optimized using a variational scheme. We implement PHQFNO using
PennyLane with PyTorch integration and evaluate it on Burgers' equation,
incompressible and compressible Navier-Stokes equations. We show that PHQFNO
recovers classical FNO accuracy. On incompressible Navier-Stokes, PHQFNO
achieves higher accuracy than its classical counterparts. Finally, we perform a
sensitivity analysis under input noise, confirming improved stability of PHQFNO
over classical baselines.

Abstract: A discrete-time conditional Gaussian Koopman network (CGKN) is developed in
this work to learn surrogate models that can perform efficient state forecast
and data assimilation (DA) for high-dimensional complex dynamical systems,
e.g., systems governed by nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs).
Focusing on nonlinear partially observed systems that are common in many
engineering and earth science applications, this work exploits Koopman
embedding to discover a proper latent representation of the unobserved system
states, such that the dynamics of the latent states are conditional linear,
i.e., linear with the given observed system states. The modeled system of the
observed and latent states then becomes a conditional Gaussian system, for
which the posterior distribution of the latent states is Gaussian and can be
efficiently evaluated via analytical formulae. The analytical formulae of DA
facilitate the incorporation of DA performance into the learning process of the
modeled system, which leads to a framework that unifies scientific machine
learning (SciML) and data assimilation. The performance of discrete-time CGKN
is demonstrated on several canonical problems governed by nonlinear PDEs with
intermittency and turbulent features, including the viscous Burgers' equation,
the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and the 2-D Navier-Stokes equations, with
which we show that the discrete-time CGKN framework achieves comparable
performance as the state-of-the-art SciML methods in state forecast and
provides efficient and accurate DA results. The discrete-time CGKN framework
also serves as an example to illustrate unifying the development of SciML
models and their other outer-loop applications such as design optimization,
inverse problems, and optimal control.

TL;DR: AutoSlim是一个基于机器学习的图简化框架，用于减少符号加速器的复杂性，通过随机森林分类剪枝低影响力转换，显著降低自动机图密度，同时保持语义正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 符号加速器在基因组学、NLP和网络安全等领域广泛应用，但面临内存使用和路由复杂性的扩展性问题。

Method: AutoSlim利用随机森林分类，基于边缘分数和结构特征剪枝低影响力转换，实现加权转换的自动化简化。

Result: 在NAPOLY+上评估，AutoSlim实现了FPGA LUTs减少40%，转换剪枝超过30%，并能处理比现有基准大一个数量级的图。

Conclusion: AutoSlim通过剪枝有效缓解了硬件资源膨胀，证明了硬件互连对成本的重要影响。

Abstract: Symbolic accelerators are increasingly used for symbolic data processing in
domains such as genomics, NLP, and cybersecurity. However, these accelerators
face scalability issues due to excessive memory use and routing complexity,
especially when targeting a large set. We present AutoSlim, a machine
learning-based graph simplification framework designed to reduce the complexity
of symbolic accelerators built on Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA)
deployed on FPGA-based overlays such as NAPOLY+. AutoSlim uses Random Forest
classification to prune low-impact transitions based on edge scores and
structural features, significantly reducing automata graph density while
preserving semantic correctness. Unlike prior tools, AutoSlim targets automated
score-aware simplification with weighted transitions, enabling efficient
ranking-based sequence analysis. We evaluated data sets (1K to 64K nodes) in
NAPOLY+ and conducted performance measurements including latency, throughput,
and resource usage. AutoSlim achieves up to 40 percent reduction in FPGA LUTs
and over 30 percent pruning in transitions, while scaling to graphs an order of
magnitude larger than existing benchmarks. Our results also demonstrate how
hardware interconnection (fanout) heavily influences hardware cost and that
AutoSlim's pruning mitigates resource blowup.

Motivation: 离线强化学习中，Q值外推误差是主要问题，尤其是线性外推。

Method: 采用奖励缩放与层归一化（RS-LN）和不可行动作惩罚（PA）结合，提出PARS算法。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试中表现优异，尤其在AntMaze Ultra任务中显著成功。

Conclusion: PARS算法有效解决了Q值外推问题，提升了离线强化学习性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with offline data suffers from Q-value extrapolation
errors. To address this issue, we first demonstrate that linear extrapolation
of the Q-function beyond the data range is particularly problematic. To
mitigate this, we propose guiding the gradual decrease of Q-values outside the
data range, which is achieved through reward scaling with layer normalization
(RS-LN) and a penalization mechanism for infeasible actions (PA). By combining
RS-LN and PA, we develop a new algorithm called PARS. We evaluate PARS across a
range of tasks, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
algorithms in both offline training and online fine-tuning on the D4RL
benchmark, with notable success in the challenging AntMaze Ultra task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统MoE架构在路由不可微分、灵活性不足以及稀疏性模式对低资源设备不友好的问题。

Method: 使用ReLU激活和RMSNorm的路由器设计，引入CLS感知训练目标，并实现高效的加速内核。

Result: BlockFFN在稀疏性和加速性能上优于其他MoE基线，TLS超过80%，8-token CLS达到70%，在终端设备上实现3.67倍加速。

Conclusion: BlockFFN是一种高效且加速友好的MoE架构，适用于低资源设备，并开源了代码和模型。

Abstract: To alleviate the computational burden of large language models (LLMs),
architectures with activation sparsity, represented by mixture-of-experts
(MoE), have attracted increasing attention. However, the non-differentiable and
inflexible routing of vanilla MoE hurts model performance. Moreover, while each
token activates only a few parameters, these sparsely-activated architectures
exhibit low chunk-level sparsity, indicating that the union of multiple
consecutive tokens activates a large ratio of parameters. Such a sparsity
pattern is unfriendly for acceleration under low-resource conditions (e.g.,
end-side devices) and incompatible with mainstream acceleration techniques
(e.g., speculative decoding). To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
MoE architecture, BlockFFN, as well as its efficient training and deployment
techniques. Specifically, we use a router integrating ReLU activation and
RMSNorm for differentiable and flexible routing. Next, to promote both
token-level sparsity (TLS) and chunk-level sparsity (CLS), CLS-aware training
objectives are designed, making BlockFFN more acceleration-friendly. Finally,
we implement efficient acceleration kernels, combining activation sparsity and
speculative decoding for the first time. The experimental results demonstrate
the superior performance of BlockFFN over other MoE baselines, achieving over
80% TLS and 70% 8-token CLS. Our kernels achieve up to 3.67$\times$ speedup on
real end-side devices than dense models. All codes and checkpoints are
available publicly (https://github.com/thunlp/BlockFFN).

TL;DR: GreedyLore是一种贪婪低秩梯度压缩算法，用于分布式学习，具有严格的收敛保证，解决了现有方法的方差高或缺乏收敛保证的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式优化在大规模信号处理和机器学习中至关重要，但通信开销是主要瓶颈。现有低秩梯度压缩方法存在高方差或缺乏收敛保证的问题。

Method: GreedyLore结合误差反馈和半懒惰子空间更新，确保压缩操作在所有迭代中保持收缩性。

Result: GreedyLore在MSGD和Adam等标准优化器下实现了线性加速收敛速率。

Conclusion: GreedyLore是首个具有收敛保证的贪婪低秩梯度压缩算法，实验验证了其理论结果。

Abstract: Distributed optimization is pivotal for large-scale signal processing and
machine learning, yet communication overhead remains a major bottleneck.
Low-rank gradient compression, in which the transmitted gradients are
approximated by low-rank matrices to reduce communication, offers a promising
remedy. Existing methods typically adopt either randomized or greedy
compression strategies: randomized approaches project gradients onto randomly
chosen subspaces, introducing high variance and degrading empirical
performance; greedy methods select the most informative subspaces, achieving
strong empirical results but lacking convergence guarantees. To address this
gap, we propose GreedyLore--the first Greedy Low-Rank gradient compression
algorithm for distributed learning with rigorous convergence guarantees.
GreedyLore incorporates error feedback to correct the bias introduced by greedy
compression and introduces a semi-lazy subspace update that ensures the
compression operator remains contractive throughout all iterations. With these
techniques, we prove that GreedyLore achieves a convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(\sigma/\sqrt{NT} + 1/T)$ under standard optimizers such as MSGD
and Adam--marking the first linear speedup convergence rate for low-rank
gradient compression. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate our
theoretical findings.

TL;DR: ORAC是一种基于探索的风险规避约束强化学习方法，通过优化奖励和成本函数的置信区间，避免保守探索导致的次优策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统风险规避约束强化学习（RaCRL）因保守探索易收敛到次优策略，无法有效平衡奖励与安全约束。

Method: 提出ORAC方法，通过动态调整成本函数的置信区间权重，鼓励探索不确定区域，同时满足安全约束。

Result: 实验证明ORAC在Safety-Gymnasium和CityLearn等任务中显著改善了奖励与成本的权衡。

Conclusion: ORAC通过乐观探索策略，有效避免了次优收敛，提升了风险规避约束强化学习的性能。

Abstract: Risk-averse Constrained Reinforcement Learning (RaCRL) aims to learn policies
that minimise the likelihood of rare and catastrophic constraint violations
caused by an environment's inherent randomness. In general, risk-aversion leads
to conservative exploration of the environment which typically results in
converging to sub-optimal policies that fail to adequately maximise reward or,
in some cases, fail to achieve the goal. In this paper, we propose an
exploration-based approach for RaCRL called Optimistic Risk-averse Actor Critic
(ORAC), which constructs an exploratory policy by maximising a local upper
confidence bound of the state-action reward value function whilst minimising a
local lower confidence bound of the risk-averse state-action cost value
function. Specifically, at each step, the weighting assigned to the cost value
is increased or decreased if it exceeds or falls below the safety constraint
value. This way the policy is encouraged to explore uncertain regions of the
environment to discover high reward states whilst still satisfying the safety
constraints. Our experimental results demonstrate that the ORAC approach
prevents convergence to sub-optimal policies and improves significantly the
reward-cost trade-off in various continuous control tasks such as
Safety-Gymnasium and a complex building energy management environment
CityLearn.

Result: 发现生成奖励模型广泛存在脆弱性，提出的新模型显著提高了稳健性。

Conclusion: 强调需要更可靠的基于LLM的评估方法，并发布了改进的奖励模型和训练数据。

Abstract: Generative reward models (also known as LLMs-as-judges), which use large
language models (LLMs) to evaluate answer quality, are increasingly adopted in
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). They are often preferred
over rigid rule-based metrics, especially for complex reasoning tasks involving
free-form outputs. In this paradigm, an LLM is typically prompted to compare a
candidate answer against a ground-truth reference and assign a binary reward
indicating correctness. Despite the seeming simplicity of this comparison task,
we find that generative reward models exhibit surprising vulnerabilities to
superficial manipulations: non-word symbols (e.g., ":" or ".") or reasoning
openers like "Thought process:" and "Let's solve this problem step by step."
can often lead to false positive rewards. We demonstrate that this weakness is
widespread across LLMs, datasets, and prompt formats, posing a serious threat
for core algorithmic paradigms that rely on generative reward models, such as
rejection sampling, preference optimization, and RLVR. To mitigate this issue,
we introduce a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy and train a new
generative reward model with substantially improved robustness. Our findings
highlight the urgent need for more reliable LLM-based evaluation methods. We
release our robust, general-domain reward model and its synthetic training data

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在揭示因果抽象在无限制对齐映射下的局限性，挑战线性表示假设的普遍应用。

Method: 通过理论和实验证明，使用任意强大的对齐映射可以将任何神经网络映射到任何算法。

Result: 研究发现无限制的因果抽象会导致其变得无意义，并提出了非线性表示困境。

Conclusion: 因果抽象不足以支持机制可解释性，未来需研究信息编码假设与因果抽象的关系。

Abstract: The concept of causal abstraction got recently popularised to demystify the
opaque decision-making processes of machine learning models; in short, a neural
network can be abstracted as a higher-level algorithm if there exists a
function which allows us to map between them. Notably, most interpretability
papers implement these maps as linear functions, motivated by the linear
representation hypothesis: the idea that features are encoded linearly in a
model's representations. However, this linearity constraint is not required by
the definition of causal abstraction. In this work, we critically examine the
concept of causal abstraction by considering arbitrarily powerful alignment
maps. In particular, we prove that under reasonable assumptions, any neural
network can be mapped to any algorithm, rendering this unrestricted notion of
causal abstraction trivial and uninformative. We complement these theoretical
findings with empirical evidence, demonstrating that it is possible to
perfectly map models to algorithms even when these models are incapable of
solving the actual task; e.g., on an experiment using randomly initialised
language models, our alignment maps reach 100% interchange-intervention
accuracy on the indirect object identification task. This raises the non-linear
representation dilemma: if we lift the linearity constraint imposed to
alignment maps in causal abstraction analyses, we are left with no principled
way to balance the inherent trade-off between these maps' complexity and
accuracy. Together, these results suggest an answer to our title's question:
causal abstraction is not enough for mechanistic interpretability, as it
becomes vacuous without assumptions about how models encode information.
Studying the connection between this information-encoding assumption and causal
abstraction should lead to exciting future work.

Result: 高于临界噪声水平时，大拥堵不会持续；简单反应方案在中等密度下表现良好且高效。

Conclusion: 简单反应方案在现实问题中具有高效性和实用性。

Abstract: In crowded environments, individuals must navigate around other occupants to
reach their destinations. Understanding and controlling traffic flows in these
spaces is relevant to coordinating robot swarms and designing infrastructure
for dense populations. Here, we combine simulations, theory, and robotic
experiments to study how noisy motion can disrupt traffic jams and enable flow
as agents travel to individual goals. Above a critical noise level, large jams
do not persist. From this observation, we analytically approximate the goal
attainment rate as a function of the noise level, then solve for the optimal
agent density and noise level that maximize the swarm's goal attainment rate.
We perform robotic experiments to corroborate our simulated and theoretical
results. Finally, we compare simple, local navigation approaches with a
sophisticated but computationally costly central planner. A simple reactive
scheme performs well up to moderate densities and is far more computationally
efficient than a planner, suggesting lessons for real-world problems.

mobile robot's angular velocity, which serves as the robot's steering command.
A newly obtained visual dataset for navigation was collected in diverse
environments with varying lighting conditions and dynamic obstacles. During
data collection, a communication link was established over Wi-Fi between a
remote server and the robot, using Robot Operating System (ROS) topics.
Velocity commands were transmitted from the server to the robot, enabling
synchronized recording of visual data and the corresponding steering commands.
Various evaluation metrics, such as Mean Squared Error, Variance Score, and

Conclusion: SelfReVision为视觉语言程序规划提供了一种高效、无需外部监督的解决方案，显著提升了计划质量和执行效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in robotic procedural
planning, yet their human-centric reasoning often omits the low-level, grounded
details needed for robotic execution. Vision-language models (VLMs) offer a
path toward more perceptually grounded plans, but current methods either rely
on expensive, large-scale models or are constrained to narrow simulation
settings. We introduce SelfReVision, a lightweight and scalable
self-improvement framework for vision-language procedural planning.
SelfReVision enables small VLMs to iteratively critique, revise, and verify
their own plans-without external supervision or teacher models-drawing
inspiration from chain-of-thought prompting and self-instruct paradigms.
Through this self-distillation loop, models generate higher-quality,
execution-ready plans that can be used both at inference and for continued
fine-tuning. Using models varying from 3B to 72B, our results show that
SelfReVision not only boosts performance over weak base VLMs but also
outperforms models 100X the size, yielding improved control in downstream
embodied tasks.

Abstract: Building a robust perception module is crucial for visuomotor policy
learning. While recent methods incorporate pre-trained 2D foundation models
into robotic perception modules to leverage their strong semantic
understanding, they struggle to capture 3D spatial information and generalize
across diverse camera viewpoints. These limitations hinder the policy's
effectiveness, especially in fine-grained robotic manipulation scenarios. To
address these challenges, we propose CL3R, a novel 3D pre-training framework
designed to enhance robotic manipulation policies. Our method integrates both
spatial awareness and semantic understanding by employing a point cloud Masked
Autoencoder to learn rich 3D representations while leveraging pre-trained 2D
foundation models through contrastive learning for efficient semantic knowledge
transfer. Additionally, we propose a 3D visual representation pre-training
framework for robotic tasks. By unifying coordinate systems across datasets and
introducing random fusion of multi-view point clouds, we mitigate camera view
ambiguity and improve generalization, enabling robust perception from novel
viewpoints at test time. Extensive experiments in both simulation and the real
world demonstrate the superiority of our method, highlighting its effectiveness
in visuomotor policy learning for robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Accurate extrinsic calibration between multiple LiDAR sensors and a
GNSS-aided inertial navigation system (GINS) is essential for achieving
reliable sensor fusion in intelligent mining environments. Such calibration
enables vehicle-road collaboration by aligning perception data from
vehicle-mounted sensors to a unified global reference frame. However, existing
methods often depend on artificial targets, overlapping fields of view, or
precise trajectory estimation, which are assumptions that may not hold in
practice. Moreover, the planar motion of mining vehicles leads to observability
issues that degrade calibration performance. This paper presents a targetless
extrinsic calibration method that aligns multiple onboard LiDAR sensors to the
GINS coordinate system without requiring overlapping sensor views or external
targets. The proposed approach introduces an observation model based on the
known installation height of the GINS unit to constrain unobservable
calibration parameters under planar motion. A joint optimization framework is
developed to refine both the extrinsic parameters and GINS trajectory by
integrating multiple constraints derived from geometric correspondences and
motion consistency. The proposed method is applicable to heterogeneous LiDAR
configurations, including both mechanical and solid-state sensors. Extensive
experiments on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate the accuracy,
robustness, and practical applicability of the approach under diverse sensor
setups.

Conclusion: 研究填补了SLAM评估和自适应传感器融合的空白，为未来研究提供了重要工具和框架。

Abstract: Considerable advancements have been achieved in SLAM methods tailored for
structured environments, yet their robustness under challenging corner cases
remains a critical limitation. Although multi-sensor fusion approaches
integrating diverse sensors have shown promising performance improvements, the
research community faces two key barriers: On one hand, the lack of
standardized and configurable benchmarks that systematically evaluate SLAM
algorithms under diverse degradation scenarios hinders comprehensive
performance assessment. While on the other hand, existing SLAM frameworks
primarily focus on fusing a limited set of sensor types, without effectively
addressing adaptive sensor selection strategies for varying environmental
conditions.
  To bridge these gaps, we make three key contributions: First, we introduce
M3DGR dataset: a sensor-rich benchmark with systematically induced degradation
patterns including visual challenge, LiDAR degeneracy, wheel slippage and GNSS
denial. Second, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of forty SLAM systems on
M3DGR, providing critical insights into their robustness and limitations under
challenging real-world conditions. Third, we develop a resilient modular
multi-sensor fusion framework named Ground-Fusion++, which demonstrates robust
performance by coupling GNSS, RGB-D, LiDAR, IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) and
wheel odometry. Codes and datasets are publicly available.

Motivation: 卫星在动态和不确定环境中自主运行时，传统的PD控制器和现有DRL算法（如TD3、PPO、A2C）在实时适应性和容错性方面表现不足，需要更强大的控制策略。

Method: 提出TD3-HD方法，结合TD3、HER和DWC，优化稀疏奖励环境下的学习能力，并在反应轮故障时维持卫星稳定性。

Result: 实验结果表明，TD3-HD在姿态误差、角速度调节和故障条件下的稳定性方面显著优于PD控制器和其他DRL算法。

Conclusion: TD3-HD是一种强大的、容错的机载AI解决方案，适用于自主卫星姿态控制。

Abstract: Reliable satellite attitude control is essential for the success of space
missions, particularly as satellites increasingly operate autonomously in
dynamic and uncertain environments. Reaction wheels (RWs) play a pivotal role
in attitude control, and maintaining control resilience during RW faults is
critical to preserving mission objectives and system stability. However,
traditional Proportional Derivative (PD) controllers and existing deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms such as TD3, PPO, and A2C often fall
short in providing the real time adaptability and fault tolerance required for
autonomous satellite operations. This study introduces a DRL-based control
strategy designed to improve satellite resilience and adaptability under fault
conditions. Specifically, the proposed method integrates Twin Delayed Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) with Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) and
Dimension Wise Clipping (DWC) referred to as TD3-HD to enhance learning in
sparse reward environments and maintain satellite stability during RW failures.
The proposed approach is benchmarked against PD control and leading DRL
algorithms. Experimental results show that TD3-HD achieves significantly lower
attitude error, improved angular velocity regulation, and enhanced stability
under fault conditions. These findings underscore the proposed method potential
as a powerful, fault tolerant, onboard AI solution for autonomous satellite
attitude control.

TL;DR: 提出了一种融合LiDAR、GNSS和IMU数据的统一框架，用于解决GNSS受限环境下的3D建图漂移问题，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR建图在GNSS受限环境下存在累积漂移问题，导致全局错位，需要一种多传感器融合的方法来提高精度。

Method: 结合动态时间规整（DTW）进行速度对齐，使用扩展卡尔曼滤波优化GNSS和IMU数据，通过NDT配准和位姿图优化构建局部地图，并利用GNSS约束锚点实现全局一致性。

Result: 全局对齐误差从3.32米降低到1.24米，提升了61.4%，构建的高精度地图支持多种应用。

Conclusion: 该方法为GNSS受限环境下的3D城市建图设立了新基准，并公开了数据集和代码以促进未来研究。

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D mapping suffers from cumulative drift causing global
misalignment, particularly in GNSS-constrained environments. To address this,
we propose a unified framework that fuses LiDAR, GNSS, and IMU data for
high-resolution city-scale mapping. The method performs velocity-based temporal
alignment using Dynamic Time Warping and refines GNSS and IMU signals via
extended Kalman filtering. Local maps are built using Normal Distributions
Transform-based registration and pose graph optimization with loop closure
detection, while global consistency is enforced using GNSS-constrained anchors
followed by fine registration of overlapping segments. We also introduce a
large-scale multimodal dataset captured in Perth, Western Australia to
facilitate future research in this direction. Our dataset comprises 144{,}000
frames acquired with a 128-channel Ouster LiDAR, synchronized RTK-GNSS
trajectories, and MEMS-IMU measurements across 21 urban loops. To assess
geometric consistency, we evaluated our method using alignment metrics based on
road centerlines and intersections to capture both global and local accuracy.
Our method reduces the average global alignment error from 3.32\,m to 1.24\,m,
achieving a 61.4\% improvement. The constructed high-fidelity map supports a
wide range of applications, including smart city planning, geospatial data
integration, infrastructure monitoring, and GPS-free navigation. Our method,
and dataset together establish a new benchmark for evaluating 3D city mapping
in GNSS-constrained environments. The dataset and code will be released
publicly.

Result: 非线性神经网络模型表现最佳，显著降低了定位误差。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了仿真到现实转换中的末端执行器位置校准问题。

Abstract: When inverse kinematics (IK) is adopted to control robotic arms in
manipulation tasks, there is often a discrepancy between the end effector (EE)
position of the robot model in the simulator and the physical EE in reality. In
most robotic scenarios with sim-to-real transfer, we have information about
joint positions in both simulation and reality, but the EE position is only
available in simulation. We developed a novel method to overcome this
difficulty based on haptic feedback calibration, using a touchscreen in front
of the robot that provides information on the EE position in the real
environment. During the calibration procedure, the robot touches specific
points on the screen, and the information is stored. In the next stage, we
build a transformation function from the data based on linear transformation
and neural networks that is capable of outputting all missing variables from
any partial input (simulated/real joint/EE position). Our results demonstrate
that a fully nonlinear neural network model performs best, significantly
reducing positioning errors.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了任务冲突，实现了动态、速度感知的全身控制。

Abstract: Learning whole-body control for locomotion and arm motions in a single policy
has challenges, as the two tasks have conflicting goals. For instance,
efficient locomotion typically favors a horizontal base orientation, while
end-effector tracking may benefit from base tilting to extend reachability.
Additionally, current Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches using a pose-based
task specification lack the ability to directly control the end-effector
velocity, making smoothly executing trajectories very challenging. To address
these limitations, we propose an RL-based framework that allows for dynamic,
velocity-aware whole-body end-effector control. Our method introduces a
multi-critic actor architecture that decouples the reward signals for
locomotion and manipulation, simplifying reward tuning and allowing the policy
to resolve task conflicts more effectively. Furthermore, we design a
twist-based end-effector task formulation that can track both discrete poses
and motion trajectories. We validate our approach through a set of simulation
and hardware experiments using a quadruped robot equipped with a robotic arm.
The resulting controller can simultaneously walk and move its end-effector and
shows emergent whole-body behaviors, where the base assists the arm in
extending the workspace, despite a lack of explicit formulations.

Conclusion: H2RH-SGS为人类-机器人交接任务提供了一种新的有效表示方法。

Abstract: Learning robot manipulation policies from raw, real-world image data requires
a large number of robot-action trials in the physical environment. Although
training using simulations offers a cost-effective alternative, the visual
domain gap between simulation and robot workspace remains a major limitation.
Gaussian Splatting visual reconstruction methods have recently provided new
directions for robot manipulation by generating realistic environments. In this
paper, we propose the first method for learning supervised-based robot
handovers solely from RGB images without the need of real-robot training or
real-robot data collection. The proposed policy learner, Human-to-Robot
Handover using Sparse-View Gaussian Splatting (H2RH-SGS), leverages sparse-view
Gaussian Splatting reconstruction of human-to-robot handover scenes to generate
robot demonstrations containing image-action pairs captured with a camera
mounted on the robot gripper. As a result, the simulated camera pose changes in
the reconstructed scene can be directly translated into gripper pose changes.
We train a robot policy on demonstrations collected with 16 household objects
and {\em directly} deploy this policy in the real environment. Experiments in
both Gaussian Splatting reconstructed scene and real-world human-to-robot
handover experiments demonstrate that H2RH-SGS serves as a new and effective
representation for the human-to-robot handover task.

TL;DR: AgentsNet是一个新的多智能体推理基准，用于评估智能体系统在协作、自组织和通信方面的能力，并测试其在不同规模网络中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在多智能体系统中展现出强大的问题解决能力，但其自组织和协作能力尚不明确，需要新的评估方法。

Method: 通过借鉴分布式系统和图论中的经典问题，设计AgentsNet基准，评估多智能体系统在网络拓扑下的协作策略、自组织和通信能力。

Result: 前沿LLMs在小规模网络中表现良好，但随着网络规模扩大性能下降。AgentsNet支持无限规模测试，并已测试了多达100个智能体的场景。

Conclusion: AgentsNet为多智能体系统的评估提供了可扩展的基准，揭示了LLMs在大规模协作中的局限性。

Abstract: Large-language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful problem-solving
capabilities, in particular when organized in multi-agent systems. However, the
advent of such systems also raises several questions on the ability of a
complex network of agents to effectively self-organize and collaborate. While
measuring performance on standard reasoning benchmarks indicates how well
multi-agent systems can solve reasoning tasks, it is unclear whether these
systems are able to leverage their topology effectively. Here, we propose
AgentsNet, a new benchmark for multi-agent reasoning. By drawing inspiration
from classical problems in distributed systems and graph theory, AgentsNet
measures the ability of multi-agent systems to collaboratively form strategies
for problem-solving, self-organization, and effective communication given a
network topology. We evaluate a variety of baseline methods on AgentsNet
including homogeneous networks of agents which first have to agree on basic
protocols for organization and communication. We find that some frontier LLMs
are already demonstrating strong performance for small networks but begin to
fall off once the size of the network scales. While existing multi-agent
benchmarks cover at most 2-5 agents, AgentsNet is practically unlimited in size
and can scale with new generations of LLMs. As such, we also probe frontier
models in a setup with up to 100 agents.

Conclusion: 研究为深度强化学习在现实控制问题中的部署提供了定量理解和系统评估。

Abstract: Over the past decade, remarkable progress has been made in adopting deep
neural networks to enhance the performance of conventional reinforcement
learning. A notable milestone was the development of Deep Q-Networks (DQN),
which achieved human-level performance across a range of Atari games,
demonstrating the potential of deep learning to stabilise and scale
reinforcement learning. Subsequently, extensions to continuous control
algorithms paved the way for a new paradigm in control, one that has attracted
broader attention than any classical control approach in recent literature.
These developments also demonstrated strong potential for advancing
data-driven, model-free algorithms for control and for achieving higher levels
of autonomy. However, the application of these methods has remained largely
confined to simulated and gaming environments, with ongoing efforts to extend
them to real-world applications. Before such deployment can be realised, a
solid and quantitative understanding of their performance on applied control
problems is necessary. This paper conducts a comparative analysis of these
approaches on four diverse benchmark problems with implementation results. This
analysis offers a scrutinising and systematic evaluation to shed light on the
real-world capabilities and limitations of deep reinforcement learning methods
in applied control settings.

Result: 集成CDMI方法检测准确率达99.33%，比竞争方法高10%，同时显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: CDMI方法在机动检测中表现出高准确性和实用性，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient maneuver detection is critical for ensuring the safety
and predictability of spacecraft trajectories. This paper presents a novel
maneuver detection approach based on comparing the confidence levels associated
with the orbital state estimation and the observation likelihood. First, a
confidence-dominance maneuver indicator (CDMI) is proposed by setting a
confidence level for the state estimation and computing the maximum likelihood
of the observation and its confidence level. The CDMI then flag a maneuver when
the observation's confidence level exceeds that of the state estimation,
indicating that the observation is unlikely under the no-maneuver hypothesis
while maintaining consistency with the prior state estimation confidence. To
efficiently compute the maximum likelihood of the observation and obtain the
CDMI, a recursive polynomial optimization method is developed, taking advantage
of convex optimization and polynomial approximation. In addition, an integrated
CDMI approach is developed to eliminate the need to manually select the state
confidence level. The integrated CDMI approach maintains high detection
accuracy while simultaneously providing an indication of maneuver likelihood,
thereby enhancing robustness and practical applicability. The performance of
the proposed CDMI-based maneuver detection approaches is evaluated against an
optimal control distance metric and two mixture-based approaches. The
simulation results demonstrate that the proposed integrated CDMI approach can
achieve up to 99.33\% detection accuracy, at least 10% higher than the
competing methods, while substantially reducing computational costs.

Conclusion: NPV-DeePC为APPJs的安全精确控制提供了可行方案，并适用于其他参数变化的非线性系统。

Abstract: Cold Atmospheric Pressure Plasma Jets (APPJs) show significant potential for
biomedical applications, but their inherent complexity, characterized by
nonlinear dynamics and strong sensitivity to operating conditions like
tip-to-surface distance, presents considerable challenges for achieving robust
and reliable real-time control. To address these issues, this paper presents
the Neural Parameter-Varying Data-enabled Predictive Control (NPV-DeePC)
framework. By integrating hyper neural networks (hypernets) into the neural
Data-enabled Predictive Control (DeePC) paradigm, the proposed method
adaptively captures system nonlinearities and parameter variations, updates the
neural feature space accordingly, and enables efficient and accurate trajectory
prediction and control. The NPV-DeePC framework is validated through extensive
simulations involving surface temperature tracking and thermal dose delivery.
The results highlight its ability to outperform existing controllers in terms
of accuracy and adaptability. The computational efficiency of the NPV-DeePC
approach makes it a viable candidate for real-time applications. These findings
underscore its potential to advance the safe and precise control of APPJs and
provide a scalable solution for other parameter-varying nonlinear systems.

Conclusion: HAPS赋能的vHetNets结合分布式PFBWD算法，为下一代无线网络提供了高效的频谱共享和大规模网络优化方案。

Abstract: Next-generation wireless networks (xG) must provide ubiquitous connectivity
while enhancing user experience in both densely populated urban areas and rural
regions. To achieve this, a disruptive network architecture is essential, and
high altitude platform stations (HAPS) offer a promising solution. By
integrating HAPS with terrestrial networks, we can create HAPS-empowered
vertical heterogeneous networks (vHetNets), which significantly improve
coverage and capacity, as well as support emerging use cases. In HAPS-empowered
vHetNets, different tiers can share the same spectrum, forming harmonized
spectrum vHetNets that enhance spectral efficiency (SE). However, we face two
major challenges: i) co-channel interference in harmonized spectrum vHetNets,
and ii) the large-scale nature of the network. To address the first challenge,
we adopt a cell-free approach as the underlying network architecture for the
HAPS-empowered vHetNet. In this approach, base stations use beamforming to
direct high-gain, narrow beams toward users, which helps mitigate interference.
However, this creates a nonconvex and high-dimensional optimization problem,
which highlights the second challenge of dealing with a large-scale network.
Consequently, centralized solutions become impractical due to the computational
and communication overhead involved. The standard two-block alternating
direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is one option, but nonconvex constraints
can hinder its convergence. As an alternative, we have developed a two-level
distributed proportional fairness beamforming weight design (PFBWD) algorithm.
This algorithm uses a combination of the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) and
a three-block ADMM framework. The proposed method effectively tackles
nonconvexity, reduces complexity, and enables scalable, distributed
optimization with guaranteed convergence.

Abstract: Representation of inductive coupling lines with conventional static phasors
is the main reason of inadequacy of the existing phasors based simplified
stability analysis methods for microgrids with inductive coupling lines. In the
literature, dynamic phasors have been proposed for the dynamic modelling of
inductive lines to conserve the simplified structure of the analysis method. In
this study a generalized stability analysis method for LV AC microgrids,
composed of droop controlled inverters, is presented. The proposed analysis
method is based on the inclusion of dynamic phasors for inductive coupling
lines into the existing phasors based stability analysis method. The results
show that the stability analysis method with dynamic phasors successfully
predicts the instability boundaries of LV AC microgrids.

Abstract: The centerline of a bobsleigh track defines its geometry and is essential for
simulation modeling. To reduce bBobsleigh training costs, leveraging the
centerline of the bobsleigh track to construct a virtual environment that
closely replicates real competitive settings presents a promising solution.
However, publicly available centerline data are typically limited and it is
imprecise to construct a training system solely based on 2-dimensional (2D)
centerline. To address this practical issue, this paper proposes a method for
generating a 3-dimensional (3D) track centerline based on 2D centerline data.
Incorporating international track design regulations, the method formulates an
optimization problem that considers total track length, height difference,
slope constraints, and geometric continuity. A Projected Gradient Descent (PGD)
algorithm is used to solve the optimization problem. The generated 3D
centerlines are compared with real track data, and the results show that the
method can reproduce realistic centerline trends from original or scaled 2D
data. For the selected track segment, the relative errors in total length,
height difference, and average slope are within 1.7%, 3.2% and 4.1%,
respectively, for real 2D data and within 1.1%, 3.5% and 4.3% respectively for
scaled data. All slope values remain within the allowable limits. Moreover, by
adjusting the segmentation or modifying the weight of height difference in the
cost function, various centerline styles applicable to different competitions
can be generated. Under different segmentation and weight factors, the maximum
errors reach up to 4.4%, 4.8%, and 9.8%, and 4.4%, 4.8%, and 10.0%,
respectively. The proposed method provides a flexible and efficient tool for
supporting bobsleigh track centerline design.

Abstract: The integration of PV systems and increased electrification levels present
significant challenges to the traditional design and operation of distribution
grids. This paper presents a methodology for extracting, validating, and
adapting grid data from a distribution system operator's (DSO) database to
facilitate large-scale grid studies, including load flow and optimal power flow

automated power flow analyses to ensure data consistency and detect potential

application, the paper proposes a method to assess the PV hosting capacity of
distribution grids, with a focus on ensuring fairness in their spatial
distribution. By incorporating fairness criteria into the analyses, we quantify
the costs (in terms of missed revenues from selling PV generation) associated
with spatial fairness.

Abstract: The increasing energy footprint of artificial intelligence systems urges
alternative computational models that are both efficient and scalable.
Neuromorphic Computing (NC) addresses this challenge by empowering event-driven
algorithms that operate with minimal power requirements through biologically
inspired spiking dynamics. We present the NeurOptimiser, a fully spike-based
optimisation framework that materialises the neuromorphic-based metaheuristic
paradigm through a decentralised NC system. The proposed approach comprises a
population of Neuromorphic Heuristic Units (NHUs), each combining spiking
neuron dynamics with spike-triggered perturbation heuristics to evolve
candidate solutions asynchronously. The NeurOptimiser's coordination arises
through native spiking mechanisms that support activity propagation, local
information sharing, and global state updates without external orchestration.
We implement this framework on Intel's Lava platform, targeting the Loihi 2
chip, and evaluate it on the noiseless BBOB suite up to 40 dimensions. We
deploy several NeurOptimisers using different configurations, mainly
considering dynamic systems such as linear and Izhikevich models for spiking
neural dynamics, and fixed and Differential Evolution mutation rules for
spike-triggered heuristics. Although these configurations are implemented as a
proof of concept, we document and outline further extensions and improvements
to the framework implementation. Results show that the proposed approach
exhibits structured population dynamics, consistent convergence, and
milliwatt-level power feasibility. They also position spike-native MHs as a
viable path toward real-time, low-energy, and decentralised optimisation.

Conclusion: 提出的基准为分析参数控制方法在复杂状态空间中的表现提供了挑战性但前景广阔的测试平台。

Abstract: Parameter control and dynamic algorithm configuration study how to
dynamically choose suitable configurations of a parametrized algorithm during
the optimization process. Despite being an intensively researched topic in
evolutionary computation, optimal control policies are known only for very few
cases, limiting the development of automated approaches to achieve them.
  With this work we propose four new benchmarks for which we derive optimal or
close-to-optimal control policies. More precisely, we consider the optimization
of the \LeadingOnes function via RLS$_{k}$, a local search algorithm allowing
for a dynamic choice of the mutation strength $k$. The benchmarks differ in
which information the algorithm can exploit to set its parameters and to select
offspring. In existing running time results, the exploitable information is
typically limited to the quality of the current-best solution. In this work, we
consider how additional information about the current state of the algorithm
can help to make better choices of parameters, and how these choices affect the
performance. Namely, we allow the algorithm to use information about the
current \OneMax value, and we find that it allows much better parameter
choices, especially in marginal states. Although those states are rarely
visited by the algorithm, such policies yield a notable speed-up in terms of
expected runtime. This makes the proposed benchmarks a challenging, but
promising testing ground for analysis of parameter control methods in rich
state spaces and of their ability to find optimal policies by catching the
performance improvements yielded by correct parameter choices.
