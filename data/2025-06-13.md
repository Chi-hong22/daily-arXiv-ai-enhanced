Abstract: Robotics and artificial intelligence hold significant potential for advancing
precision agriculture. While robotic systems have been successfully deployed
for various tasks, adapting them to perform diverse missions remains
challenging, particularly because end users often lack technical expertise. In
this paper, we present an end-to-end system that leverages large language
models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT, to enable users to assign complex data
collection tasks to autonomous robots using natural language instructions. To
enhance reusability, mission plans are encoded using an existing IEEE task
specification standard, and are executed on robots via ROS2 nodes that bridge
high-level mission descriptions with existing ROS libraries. Through extensive
experiments, we highlight the strengths and limitations of LLMs in this
context, particularly regarding spatial reasoning and solving complex routing
challenges, and show how our proposed implementation overcomes them.

### [2] [Estimating the Joint Probability of Scenario Parameters with Gaussian Mixture Copula Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10098)
*Christian Reichenbächer,Philipp Rank,Jochen Hipp,Oliver Bringmann*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文首次将高斯混合Copula模型应用于自动驾驶系统的安全验证中，用于驾驶场景的统计建模。该模型结合了高斯混合模型的多模态表达能力和Copula的灵活性，能够分别建模边缘分布和依赖关系。


<details>

Motivation: 驾驶场景参数的联合概率分布对于基于场景的安全评估至关重要，而现有方法（如高斯混合模型和高斯Copula模型）在表达多模态数据和灵活性上存在不足。

Method: 提出高斯混合Copula模型，结合高斯混合模型和Copula的优势，分别建模边缘分布和依赖关系，并在真实驾驶数据上进行验证。

Result: 在1800万个场景实例的评估中，高斯混合Copula模型在似然和Sinkhorn距离上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 高斯混合Copula模型为未来基于场景的验证框架提供了更优的统计建模基础。

Abstract: This paper presents the first application of Gaussian Mixture Copula Models
to the statistical modeling of driving scenarios for the safety validation of
automated driving systems. Knowledge of the joint probability distribution of
scenario parameters is essential for scenario-based safety assessment, where
risk quantification depends on the likelihood of concrete parameter
combinations. Gaussian Mixture Copula Models bring together the multimodal
expressivity of Gaussian Mixture Models and the flexibility of copulas,
enabling separate modeling of marginal distributions and dependencies. We
benchmark Gaussian Mixture Copula Models against previously proposed approaches
- Gaussian Mixture Models and Gaussian Copula Models - using real-world driving
data drawn from scenarios defined in United Nations Regulation No. 157. Our
evaluation across 18 million scenario instances demonstrates that Gaussian
Mixture Copula Models provide a better fit to the data in terms of both
likelihood and Sinkhorn distance. These results suggest that Gaussian Mixture
Copula Models are a compelling foundation for future scenario-based validation
frameworks.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is transforming precision agriculture, offering
farmers new tools to streamline their daily operations. While these
technological advances promise increased efficiency, they often introduce
additional complexity and steep learning curves that are particularly
challenging for non-technical users who must balance tech adoption with
existing workloads. In this paper, we present a natural language (NL) robotic
mission planner that enables non-specialists to control heterogeneous robots
through a common interface. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) and
predefined primitives, our architecture seamlessly translates human language
into intermediate descriptions that can be executed by different robotic
platforms. With this system, users can formulate complex agricultural missions
without writing any code. In the work presented in this paper, we extend our
previous system tailored for wheeled robot mission planning through a new class
of experiments involving robotic manipulation and computer vision tasks. Our
results demonstrate that the architecture is both general enough to support a
diverse set of robots and powerful enough to execute complex mission requests.
This work represents a significant step toward making robotic automation in
precision agriculture more accessible to non-technical users.

### [4] [A Navigation Framework Utilizing Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10172)
*Yicheng Duan,Kaiyu tang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种模块化的视觉语言导航框架，通过解耦视觉语言理解和动作规划，结合轻量级规划逻辑，实现高效导航。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型视觉语言模型在导航任务中的计算成本和实时部署挑战。

Method: 集成冻结的视觉语言模型Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct，结合提示工程、结构化历史管理和双帧视觉输入策略。

Result: 在Room-to-Room基准测试中初步验证，但未见环境的泛化能力有待提升。

Conclusion: 模块化方法为高效导航系统奠定了基础，未来可通过增强环境先验和多模态输入集成进一步改进。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) presents a complex challenge in embodied
AI, requiring agents to interpret natural language instructions and navigate
through visually rich, unfamiliar environments. Recent advances in large
vision-language models (LVLMs), such as CLIP and Flamingo, have significantly
improved multimodal understanding but introduced new challenges related to
computational cost and real-time deployment. In this project, we propose a
modular, plug-and-play navigation framework that decouples vision-language
understanding from action planning. By integrating a frozen vision-language
model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, with lightweight planning logic, we aim to
achieve flexible, fast, and adaptable navigation without extensive model
fine-tuning. Our framework leverages prompt engineering, structured history
management, and a two-frame visual input strategy to enhance decision-making
continuity across navigation steps. We evaluate our system on the Room-to-Room
benchmark within the VLN-CE setting using the Matterport3D dataset and
Habitat-Lab simulation environment. Although our initial results reveal
challenges in generalizing to unseen environments under strict evaluation
settings, our modular approach lays a foundation for scalable and efficient
navigation systems, highlighting promising directions for future improvement
through enhanced environmental priors and expanded multimodal input
integration.

### [5] [A Unified Framework for Probabilistic Dynamic-, Trajectory- and Vision-based Virtual Fixtures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10239)
*Maximilian Mühlbauer,Freek Stulp,Sylvain Calinon,Alin Albu-Schäffer,João Silvério*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的概率虚拟夹具框架，支持手动、半自动和全自动模式的无缝切换，适用于不同任务阶段的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在保持人类参与的同时，通过部分自动化提高任务效率，同时确保高精度。

Method: 结合概率动态系统虚拟夹具和位置轨迹夹具，支持几何感知和最优阻抗增益，适用于粗引导和精确任务。

Result: 实验验证了框架在不同机器人上的多模式操作和编程便捷性。

Conclusion: 该框架为虚拟夹具提供了灵活性和适应性，显著提升了任务效率和精度。

Abstract: Probabilistic Virtual Fixtures (VFs) enable the adaptive selection of the
most suitable haptic feedback for each phase of a task, based on learned or
perceived uncertainty. While keeping the human in the loop remains essential,
for instance, to ensure high precision, partial automation of certain task
phases is critical for productivity. We present a unified framework for
probabilistic VFs that seamlessly switches between manual fixtures,
semi-automated fixtures (with the human handling precise tasks), and full
autonomy. We introduce a novel probabilistic Dynamical System-based VF for
coarse guidance, enabling the robot to autonomously complete certain task
phases while keeping the human operator in the loop. For tasks requiring
precise guidance, we extend probabilistic position-based trajectory fixtures
with automation allowing for seamless human interaction as well as
geometry-awareness and optimal impedance gains. For manual tasks requiring very
precise guidance, we also extend visual servoing fixtures with the same
geometry-awareness and impedance behaviour. We validate our approach
experimentally on different robots, showcasing multiple operation modes and the
ease of programming fixtures.

### [6] [Innovative Adaptive Imaged Based Visual Servoing Control of 6 DoFs Industrial Robot Manipulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10240)
*Rongfei Li,Francis Assadian*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Youla参数化的前馈-反馈自适应控制算法，用于解决视觉伺服中特征点超出视野时的稳定控制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉伺服方法多依赖视野内的3D点特征，但特征点超出视野时控制效果不佳。

Method: 结合前馈-反馈结构和自适应控制，通过特征估计环实现稳定快速控制，并在线线性化解耦相机与机器人模型。

Result: 仿真验证了控制器在多种场景下的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法易于实现且适用于不同工业机器人系统。

Abstract: Image-based visual servoing (IBVS) methods have been well developed and used
in many applications, especially in pose (position and orientation) alignment.
However, most research papers focused on developing control solutions when 3D
point features can be detected inside the field of view. This work proposes an
innovative feedforward-feedback adaptive control algorithm structure with the
Youla Parameterization method. A designed feature estimation loop ensures
stable and fast motion control when point features are outside the field of
view. As 3D point features move inside the field of view, the IBVS feedback
loop preserves the precision of the pose at the end of the control period.
Also, an adaptive controller is developed in the feedback loop to stabilize the
system in the entire range of operations. The nonlinear camera and robot
manipulator model is linearized and decoupled online by an adaptive algorithm.
The adaptive controller is then computed based on the linearized model
evaluated at current linearized point. The proposed solution is robust and easy
to implement in different industrial robotic systems. Various scenarios are
used in simulations to validate the effectiveness and robust performance of the
proposed controller.

### [7] [A Novel Feedforward Youla Parameterization Method for Avoiding Local Minima in Stereo Image Based Visual Servoing Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10252)

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新颖的控制策略，用于精确校准立体相机的位姿，避免局部极小值问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机器人导航和操作中，准确确定相机相对于环境的位姿至关重要，但传统方法在视觉伺服控制中可能陷入局部极小值。

Method: 结合前馈控制器和基于Youla参数化的反馈控制器，确保鲁棒的伺服性能。

Result: 仿真表明，该方法能有效避免局部极小值，使相机准确高效地到达目标位姿。

Conclusion: 提出的控制策略解决了视觉伺服中的局部极小值问题，提升了相机位姿估计的准确性和效率。

Abstract: In robot navigation and manipulation, accurately determining the camera's
pose relative to the environment is crucial for effective task execution. In
this paper, we systematically prove that this problem corresponds to the
Perspective-3-Point (P3P) formulation, where exactly three known 3D points and
their corresponding 2D image projections are used to estimate the pose of a
stereo camera. In image-based visual servoing (IBVS) control, the system
becomes overdetermined, as the 6 degrees of freedom (DoF) of the stereo camera
must align with 9 observed 2D features in the scene. When more constraints are
imposed than available DoFs, global stability cannot be guaranteed, as the
camera may become trapped in a local minimum far from the desired configuration
during servoing. To address this issue, we propose a novel control strategy for
accurately positioning a calibrated stereo camera. Our approach integrates a
feedforward controller with a Youla parameterization-based feedback controller,
ensuring robust servoing performance. Through simulations, we demonstrate that
our method effectively avoids local minima and enables the camera to reach the
desired pose accurately and efficiently.

### [8] [Learning Safe Control via On-the-Fly Bandit Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10279)
*Alexandre Capone,Ryan Cosner,Aaaron Ames,Sandra Hirche*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合控制屏障函数和高斯过程的方法，通过动态收集数据确保安全性，无需备用控制器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决模型不确定性高时安全过滤器可能失效的问题，避免依赖备用控制器。

Method: 使用高斯过程算法动态收集数据，结合控制屏障函数确保安全性。

Result: 方法在零均值先验动力学模型下可证明安全性，无需备用控制器。

Conclusion: 这是首个无需备用控制器的安全学习控制方法。

Abstract: Control tasks with safety requirements under high levels of model uncertainty
are increasingly common. Machine learning techniques are frequently used to
address such tasks, typically by leveraging model error bounds to specify
robust constraint-based safety filters. However, if the learned model
uncertainty is very high, the corresponding filters are potentially invalid,
meaning no control input satisfies the constraints imposed by the safety
filter. While most works address this issue by assuming some form of safe
backup controller, ours tackles it by collecting additional data on the fly
using a Gaussian process bandit-type algorithm. We combine a control barrier
function with a learned model to specify a robust certificate that ensures
safety if feasible. Whenever infeasibility occurs, we leverage the control
barrier function to guide exploration, ensuring the collected data contributes
toward the closed-loop system safety. By combining a safety filter with
exploration in this manner, our method provably achieves safety in a setting
that allows for a zero-mean prior dynamics model, without requiring a backup
controller. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first safe learning-based
control method that achieves this.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种多尺度贝叶斯优化方法，用于控制核聚变中的撕裂不稳定性，显著优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 核聚变系统动态复杂、数据质量差、硬件易故障，现有方法无法全面解决问题。

Method: 结合高频数据驱动动态模型与低频高斯过程，通过实验间更新高斯过程快速适应新数据。

Result: 离线测试显著优于基线；现场实验成功率达50%，比历史结果提升117%。

Conclusion: 多尺度贝叶斯优化方法在核聚变控制中表现出色，为解决复杂系统问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Machine learning algorithms often struggle to control complex real-world
systems. In the case of nuclear fusion, these challenges are exacerbated, as
the dynamics are notoriously complex, data is poor, hardware is subject to
failures, and experiments often affect dynamics beyond the experiment's
duration. Existing tools like reinforcement learning, supervised learning, and
Bayesian optimization address some of these challenges but fail to provide a
comprehensive solution. To overcome these limitations, we present a multi-scale
Bayesian optimization approach that integrates a high-frequency data-driven
dynamics model with a low-frequency Gaussian process. By updating the Gaussian
process between experiments, the method rapidly adapts to new data, refining
the predictions of the less reliable dynamical model. We validate our approach
by controlling tearing instabilities in the DIII-D nuclear fusion plant.
Offline testing on historical data shows that our method significantly
outperforms several baselines. Results on live experiments on the DIII-D
tokamak, conducted under high-performance plasma scenarios prone to
instabilities, shows a 50% success rate, marking a 117% improvement over
historical outcomes.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级方法，通过结合OSM地图的结构化道路元数据和道路设计手册中的车道宽度先验，改进了基于地图先验的车道拓扑预测模型SMERF，提升了车道和交通元素的检测及其关联性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车道拓扑预测是自动驾驶导航的关键，而道路环境信息通常遵循自然语言编码的惯例（如设计规范和道路名称），因此需要利用这些信息提升预测准确性。

Method: 结合OSM地图的结构化道路元数据和道路设计手册中的车道宽度先验，增强SMERF模型的输入信息。

Result: 在两个地理多样化的复杂交叉口场景中，方法在车道和交通元素检测及其关联方面表现更优，并通过四种拓扑感知指标验证了性能。

Conclusion: 该方法能够泛化并适应多样化的拓扑结构和条件，证明了其有效性和扩展性。

Abstract: Lane-topology prediction is a critical component of safe and reliable
autonomous navigation. An accurate understanding of the road environment aids
this task. We observe that this information often follows conventions encoded
in natural language, through design codes that reflect the road structure and
road names that capture the road functionality. We augment this information in
a lightweight manner to SMERF, a map-prior-based online lane-topology
prediction model, by combining structured road metadata from OSM maps and
lane-width priors from Road design manuals with the road centerline encodings.
We evaluate our method on two geo-diverse complex intersection scenarios. Our
method shows improvement in both lane and traffic element detection and their
association. We report results using four topology-aware metrics to
comprehensively assess the model performance. These results demonstrate the
ability of our approach to generalize and scale to diverse topologies and
conditions.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过稀疏标记的真实工业数据自主学习机器人操作的方法，提升了多吸盘机器人抓取的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在仓库等真实环境中从杂乱堆中抓取多样化物品的挑战，同时满足高吞吐量的延迟要求。

Method: 利用多模态视觉编码器（RGB、深度和语义分割）预测抓取成功率，结合多模态预训练和微调策略。

Result: 在大规模物品抓取数据集上进行了全面实验，验证了多模态训练的重要性以及模型在预训练中学习模态关系的能力。

Conclusion: 多模态训练和预训练显著提升了抓取性能，且微调后仅需部分模态输入即可实现高效推理。

Abstract: This work demonstrates how autonomously learning aspects of robotic operation
from sparsely-labeled, real-world data of deployed, engineered solutions at
industrial scale can provide with solutions that achieve improved performance.
Specifically, it focuses on multi-suction robot picking and performs a
comprehensive study on the application of multi-modal visual encoders for
predicting the success of candidate robotic picks. Picking diverse items from
unstructured piles is an important and challenging task for robot manipulation
in real-world settings, such as warehouses. Methods for picking from clutter
must work for an open set of items while simultaneously meeting latency
constraints to achieve high throughput. The demonstrated approach utilizes
multiple input modalities, such as RGB, depth and semantic segmentation, to
estimate the quality of candidate multi-suction picks. The strategy is trained
from real-world item picking data, with a combination of multimodal pretrain
and finetune. The manuscript provides comprehensive experimental evaluation
performed over a large item-picking dataset, an item-picking dataset targeted
to include partial occlusions, and a package-picking dataset, which focuses on
containers, such as boxes and envelopes, instead of unpackaged items. The
evaluation measures performance for different item configurations, pick scenes,
and object types. Ablations help to understand the effects of in-domain
pretraining, the impact of different modalities and the importance of
finetuning. These ablations reveal both the importance of training over
multiple modalities but also the ability of models to learn during pretraining
the relationship between modalities so that during finetuning and inference,
only a subset of them can be used as input.

### [12] [Towards more efficient quantitative safety validation of residual risk for assisted and automated driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10363)
*Daniel Betschinske,Malte Schrimpf,Steven Peters,Kamil Klonecki,Jan Peter Karch,Moritz Lippert*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何提高基于FOT的宏观安全验证效率，分析了现有减少FOT测试工作的方法，并指出其局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统FOT方法在高自动化级别下测试成本高且效率低，需探索更高效的方法。

Method: 系统评估FOT的减少方法，基于ISO 21448建立通用模型和基准模型，并分析其优缺点。

Result: 现有方法虽有一定潜力，但均存在不足，无法完全替代FOT。

Conclusion: FOT在ADAS和ADS安全验证中仍不可或缺，需进一步研究改进方法。

Abstract: The safety validation of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and
Automated Driving Systems (ADS) increasingly demands efficient and reliable
methods to quantify residual risk while adhering to international standards
such as ISO 21448. Traditionally, Field Operational Testing (FOT) has been
pivotal for macroscopic safety validation of automotive driving functions up to
SAE automation level 2. However, state-of-the-art derivations for empirical
safety demonstrations using FOT often result in impractical testing efforts,
particularly at higher automation levels. Even at lower automation levels, this
limitation - coupled with the substantial costs associated with FOT - motivates
the exploration of approaches to enhance the efficiency of FOT-based
macroscopic safety validation. Therefore, this publication systematically
identifies and evaluates state-of-the-art Reduction Approaches (RAs) for FOT,
including novel methods reported in the literature. Based on an analysis of ISO
21448, two models are derived: a generic model capturing the argumentation
components of the standard, and a base model, exemplarily applied to Automatic
Emergency Braking (AEB) systems, establishing a baseline for the real-world
driving requirement for a Quantitative Safety Validation of Residual Risk
(QSVRR). Subsequently, the RAs are assessed using four criteria:
quantifiability, threats to validity, missing links, and black box
compatibility, highlighting potential benefits, inherent limitations, and
identifying key areas for further research. Our evaluation reveals that, while
several approaches offer potential, none are free from missing links or other
substantial shortcomings. Moreover, no identified alternative can fully replace
FOT, reflecting its crucial role in the safety validation of ADAS and ADS.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型反应式控制器，用于机器臂在密集、遮挡严重的农业环境中安全导航，结合末端执行器位置和实时触觉反馈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉或模型依赖方法在农业冠层等密集、遮挡严重的环境中效果不佳，需要一种能安全接触且不损坏植物的导航方法。

Method: 基于末端执行器位置和实时触觉反馈，设计了一种权衡绕过障碍物和推开障碍物的交互策略。

Conclusion: 该工作为密集、接触丰富的可变形环境中的安全自适应交互奠定了基础，支持未来农业任务如修剪和收获。

Abstract: Robotic navigation in dense, cluttered environments such as agricultural
canopies presents significant challenges due to physical and visual occlusion
caused by leaves and branches. Traditional vision-based or model-dependent
approaches often fail in these settings, where physical interaction without
damaging foliage and branches is necessary to reach a target. We present a
novel reactive controller that enables safe navigation for a robotic arm in a
contact-rich, cluttered, deformable environment using end-effector position and
real-time tactile feedback. Our proposed framework's interaction strategy is
based on a trade-off between minimizing disturbance by maneuvering around
obstacles and pushing through them to move towards the target. We show that
over 35 trials in 3 experimental plant setups with an occluded target, the
proposed controller successfully reached the target in all trials without
breaking any branch and outperformed the state-of-the-art model-free controller
in robustness and adaptability. This work lays the foundation for safe,
adaptive interaction in cluttered, contact-rich deformable environments,
enabling future agricultural tasks such as pruning and harvesting in plant
canopies.

Conclusion: 研究为群体对话适应性设计提供了新见解，强调了多模态策略的重要性，对HAI、HRI和HMI领域有贡献。

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of a group-adaptive conversation design in
two socially interactive agents (SIAs) through two real-world studies. Both
SIAs - Furhat, a social robot, and MetaHuman, a virtual agent - were equipped
with a conversational artificial intelligence (CAI) backend combining hybrid
retrieval and generative models. The studies were carried out in an in-the-wild
setting with a total of $N = 188$ participants who interacted with the SIAs -
in dyads, triads or larger groups - at a German museum. Although the results
did not reveal a significant effect of the group-sensitive conversation design
on perceived satisfaction, the findings provide valuable insights into the
challenges of adapting CAI for multi-party interactions and across different
embodiments (robot vs.\ virtual agent), highlighting the need for multimodal
strategies beyond linguistic pluralization. These insights contribute to the
fields of Human-Agent Interaction (HAI), Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), and
broader Human-Machine Interaction (HMI), providing insights for future research
on effective dialogue adaptation in group settings.

Abstract: Constructing a physically realistic and accurately scaled simulated 3D world
is crucial for the training and evaluation of embodied intelligence tasks. The
diversity, realism, low cost accessibility and affordability of 3D data assets
are critical for achieving generalization and scalability in embodied AI.
However, most current embodied intelligence tasks still rely heavily on
traditional 3D computer graphics assets manually created and annotated, which
suffer from high production costs and limited realism. These limitations
significantly hinder the scalability of data driven approaches. We present
EmbodiedGen, a foundational platform for interactive 3D world generation. It
enables the scalable generation of high-quality, controllable and
photorealistic 3D assets with accurate physical properties and real-world scale
in the Unified Robotics Description Format (URDF) at low cost. These assets can
be directly imported into various physics simulation engines for fine-grained
physical control, supporting downstream tasks in training and evaluation.
EmbodiedGen is an easy-to-use, full-featured toolkit composed of six key
modules: Image-to-3D, Text-to-3D, Texture Generation, Articulated Object
Generation, Scene Generation and Layout Generation. EmbodiedGen generates
diverse and interactive 3D worlds composed of generative 3D assets, leveraging
generative AI to address the challenges of generalization and evaluation to the
needs of embodied intelligence related research. Code is available at

Result: 该方法在7自由度Franka Emika Panda机器人上进行了验证。

Conclusion: Lie群公式化提供了一种高效且参数化的方法，适用于机器人臂的控制。

Abstract: Optimal control in general, and flatness-based control in particular, of
robotic arms necessitate to compute the first and second time derivatives of
the joint torques/forces required to achieve a desired motion. In view of the
required computational efficiency, recursive $O(n)$-algorithms were proposed to
this end. Aiming at compact yet efficient formulations, a Lie group formulation
was recently proposed, making use of body-fixed and hybrid representation of
twists and wrenches. In this paper a formulation is introduced using the
spatial representation. The second-order inverse dynamics algorithm is
accompanied by a fourth-order forward and inverse kinematics algorithm. An
advantage of all Lie group formulations is that they can be parameterized in
terms of vectorial quantities that are readily available. The method is
demonstrated for the 7 DOF Franka Emika Panda robot.

*Yuhang Zhang,Haosheng Yu,Jiaping Xiao,Mir Feroskhan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VLFly框架通过结合语言模型和视觉语言模型，解决了无人机在复杂环境中语言导航的泛化性和连续动作空间问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言导航中泛化性不足和依赖离散动作空间的问题。

Method: 整合指令编码器、目标检索器和路径规划器，生成连续速度命令。

Result: 在多样模拟和真实环境中表现优异，支持开放词汇目标理解。

Conclusion: VLFly展示了强大的语言导航泛化能力，适用于复杂环境。

Abstract: Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is a long-standing challenge in
autonomous robotics, aiming to empower agents with the ability to follow human
instructions while navigating complex environments. Two key bottlenecks remain
in this field: generalization to out-of-distribution environments and reliance
on fixed discrete action spaces. To address these challenges, we propose
Vision-Language Fly (VLFly), a framework tailored for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs) to execute language-guided flight. Without the requirement for
localization or active ranging sensors, VLFly outputs continuous velocity
commands purely from egocentric observations captured by an onboard monocular
camera. The VLFly integrates three modules: an instruction encoder based on a
large language model (LLM) that reformulates high-level language into
structured prompts, a goal retriever powered by a vision-language model (VLM)
that matches these prompts to goal images via vision-language similarity, and a
waypoint planner that generates executable trajectories for real-time UAV
control. VLFly is evaluated across diverse simulation environments without
additional fine-tuning and consistently outperforms all baselines. Moreover,
real-world VLN tasks in indoor and outdoor environments under direct and
indirect instructions demonstrate that VLFly achieves robust open-vocabulary
goal understanding and generalized navigation capabilities, even in the
presence of abstract language input.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合视觉和触觉信息的方法，用于机器人手内物体姿态估计，显著提高了遮挡情况下的准确性。


<details>

Motivation: 视觉遮挡是视觉方法的主要挑战，需要结合其他传感器信息以提高姿态估计的准确性。

Method: 融合手腕RGB-D相机和指尖触觉传感器的数据，使用加权和传感器融合模块，改进的加权点云ICP算法。

Result: 平均姿态估计误差为7.5毫米和16.7度，比纯视觉方法提升20%。

Conclusion: 结合触觉信息显著提高了遮挡情况下的姿态估计精度，适用于实际物体操作任务。

Abstract: Accurate in-hand pose estimation is crucial for robotic object manipulation,
but visual occlusion remains a major challenge for vision-based approaches.
This paper presents an approach to robotic in-hand object pose estimation,
combining visual and tactile information to accurately determine the position
and orientation of objects grasped by a robotic hand. We address the challenge
of visual occlusion by fusing visual information from a wrist-mounted RGB-D
camera with tactile information from vision-based tactile sensors mounted on
the fingertips of a robotic gripper. Our approach employs a weighting and
sensor fusion module to combine point clouds from heterogeneous sensor types
and control each modality's contribution to the pose estimation process. We use
an augmented Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm adapted for weighted point
clouds to estimate the 6D object pose. Our experiments show that incorporating
tactile information significantly improves pose estimation accuracy,
particularly when occlusion is high. Our method achieves an average pose
estimation error of 7.5 mm and 16.7 degrees, outperforming vision-only
baselines by up to 20%. We also demonstrate the ability of our method to
perform precise object manipulation in a real-world insertion task.

Motivation: 现有语言操控任务假设指令与环境完美对齐，限制了鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出RAMA基准和RationalVLA模型，整合高层视觉语言模型与低层操控策略。

Result: RationalVLA在RAMA上成功率提升14.5%，任务长度减少0.94，实际应用验证有效。

Conclusion: RAMA和RationalVLA显著提升了机器人对自然语言指令的理解和响应能力。

Abstract: A fundamental requirement for real-world robotic deployment is the ability to
understand and respond to natural language instructions. Existing
language-conditioned manipulation tasks typically assume that instructions are
perfectly aligned with the environment. This assumption limits robustness and
generalization in realistic scenarios where instructions may be ambiguous,
irrelevant, or infeasible. To address this problem, we introduce RAtional
MAnipulation (RAMA), a new benchmark that challenges models with both unseen
executable instructions and defective ones that should be rejected. In RAMA, we
construct a dataset with over 14,000 samples, including diverse defective
instructions spanning six dimensions: visual, physical, semantic, motion,
safety, and out-of-context. We further propose the Rational
Vision-Language-Action model (RationalVLA). It is a dual system for robotic
arms that integrates the high-level vision-language model with the low-level
manipulation policy by introducing learnable latent space embeddings. This
design enables RationalVLA to reason over instructions, reject infeasible
commands, and execute manipulation effectively. Experiments demonstrate that
RationalVLA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on RAMA by a 14.5% higher
success rate and 0.94 average task length, while maintaining competitive
performance on standard manipulation tasks. Real-world trials further validate
its effectiveness and robustness in practical applications. Our project page is

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于不变扩展卡尔曼滤波（InEKF）的框架，用于整合部分方向测量，以提高自主水面船只（ASV）在开放海洋环境中的状态估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASV在海洋科学中日益重要，但精确的状态估计（尤其是姿态）对海底测绘至关重要。传统方法依赖固定地标的相对位置测量，而开放海洋中的ASV主要观测后退的地平线。

Method: 利用前向单目相机估计地平线相关的横摇和纵摇，结合双天线GPS航向测量，提出了一种新颖的InEKF框架以整合部分方向数据。

Result: 实验证明，该方法在开放海洋环境中对ASV状态估计具有高效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的部分方向测量方法为ASV在开放海洋中的精确状态估计提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous surface vessels (ASVs) are increasingly vital for marine science,
offering robust platforms for underwater mapping and inspection. Accurate state
estimation, particularly of vehicle pose, is paramount for precise seafloor
mapping, as even small surface deviations can have significant consequences
when sensing the seafloor below. To address this challenge, we propose an
Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (InEKF) framework designed to integrate
partial orientation measurements. While conventional estimation often relies on
relative position measurements to fixed landmarks, open ocean ASVs primarily
observe a receding horizon. We leverage forward-facing monocular cameras to
estimate roll and pitch with respect to this horizon, which provides
yaw-ambiguous partial orientation information. To effectively utilize these
measurements within the InEKF, we introduce a novel framework for incorporating
such partial orientation data. This approach contrasts with traditional InEKF
implementations that assume full orientation measurements and is particularly
relevant for planar vehicle motion constrained to a "seafaring plane." This
paper details the developed InEKF framework; its integration with horizon-based
roll/pitch observations and dual-antenna GPS heading measurements for ASV state
estimation; and provides a comparative analysis against the InEKF using full
orientation and a Multiplicative EKF (MEKF). Our results demonstrate the
efficacy and robustness of the proposed partial orientation measurements for
accurate ASV state estimation in open ocean environments.

Result: 计算时间大幅减少，预测精度与仿真相当；结合实验数据后，长期预测性能优于纯仿真。

Conclusion: 该方法在机器人导航和探索中具有潜力，能够推广到不同场景。

Abstract: An alternative data-driven modeling approach has been proposed and employed
to gain fundamental insights into robot motion interaction with granular
terrain at certain length scales. The approach is based on an integration of
dimension reduction (Sequentially Truncated Higher-Order Singular Value
Decomposition), surrogate modeling (Gaussian Process), and data assimilation
techniques (Reduced Order Particle Filter). This approach can be used online
and is based on offline data, obtained from the offline collection of
high-fidelity simulation data and a set of sparse experimental data. The
results have shown that orders of magnitude reduction in computational time can
be obtained from the proposed data-driven modeling approach compared with
physics-based high-fidelity simulations. With only simulation data as input,
the data-driven prediction technique can generate predictions that have
comparable accuracy as simulations. With both simulation data and sparse
physical experimental measurement as input, the data-driven approach with its
embedded data assimilation techniques has the potential in outperforming only
high-fidelity simulations for the long-horizon predictions. In addition, it is
demonstrated that the data-driven modeling approach can also reproduce the
scaling relationship recovered by physics-based simulations for maximum
resistive forces, which may indicate its general predictability beyond a
case-by-case basis. The results are expected to help robot navigation and
exploration in unknown and complex terrains during both online and offline
phases.

Motivation: 随着自主系统效率和可靠性的提升，研究其在机器人辅助交付任务中如何影响人类信任。

Method: 使用输入-输出隐马尔可夫模型（IOHMM）建模人类行为，分析信任动态和行动概率。

Result: 高信任时人类更倾向于自主部署机器人；长解释修复信任效果最佳，否认防止信任流失最有效。

Conclusion: 模型生成的信任估计与自我报告值一致，为实时调整人类对自主系统的信任提供了基础。

Abstract: With increasing efficiency and reliability, autonomous systems are becoming
valuable assistants to humans in various tasks. In the context of
robot-assisted delivery, we investigate how robot performance and trust repair
strategies impact human trust. In this task, while handling a secondary task,
humans can choose to either send the robot to deliver autonomously or manually
control it. The trust repair strategies examined include short and long
explanations, apology and promise, and denial.
  Using data from human participants, we model human behavior using an
Input-Output Hidden Markov Model (IOHMM) to capture the dynamics of trust and
human action probabilities. Our findings indicate that humans are more likely
to deploy the robot autonomously when their trust is high. Furthermore, state
transition estimates show that long explanations are the most effective at
repairing trust following a failure, while denial is most effective at
preventing trust loss.
  We also demonstrate that the trust estimates generated by our model are
isomorphic to self-reported trust values, making them interpretable. This model
lays the groundwork for developing optimal policies that facilitate real-time
adjustment of human trust in autonomous systems.

we derive a sliding motion model for objects clamped in a parallel gripper with
two symmetric, variable-friction contact patches. Third, we propose a motion
planner that coordinates end-effector finger trajectories and fingertip
vibrations to achieve the desired object pose. In real-world trials, Vib2Move
consistently yields final positioning errors below 6 mm, demonstrating
reliable, high-precision manipulation across a variety of planar objects. For

Result: 数据扩展对端到端方法有益，但结合基础模型的模块化系统在多样化场景中表现更优。

Conclusion: GenManip平台有望为真实条件下策略泛化研究提供关键支持。

Abstract: Robotic manipulation in real-world settings remains challenging, especially
regarding robust generalization. Existing simulation platforms lack sufficient
support for exploring how policies adapt to varied instructions and scenarios.
Thus, they lag behind the growing interest in instruction-following foundation
models like LLMs, whose adaptability is crucial yet remains underexplored in
fair comparisons. To bridge this gap, we introduce GenManip, a realistic
tabletop simulation platform tailored for policy generalization studies. It
features an automatic pipeline via LLM-driven task-oriented scene graph to
synthesize large-scale, diverse tasks using 10K annotated 3D object assets. To
systematically assess generalization, we present GenManip-Bench, a benchmark of
200 scenarios refined via human-in-the-loop corrections. We evaluate two policy
types: (1) modular manipulation systems integrating foundation models for
perception, reasoning, and planning, and (2) end-to-end policies trained
through scalable data collection. Results show that while data scaling benefits
end-to-end methods, modular systems enhanced with foundation models generalize
more effectively across diverse scenarios. We anticipate this platform to
facilitate critical insights for advancing policy generalization in realistic
conditions. Project Page: https://genmanip.axi404.top/.

Motivation: 人类通过主动观察来行动，因此设计一个能根据任务需求主动注视的机器人系统。

Method: 开发机械眼球，通过360度摄像头收集数据，结合仿真环境和BC-RL循环训练手眼协调策略。

Result: EyeRobot在五个全景工作空间任务中表现出色，能有效支持大范围操作。

Conclusion: EyeRobot展示了通过注视行为促进手眼协调的潜力，适用于单摄像头大范围操作任务。

Abstract: Humans do not passively observe the visual world -- we actively look in order
to act. Motivated by this principle, we introduce EyeRobot, a robotic system
with gaze behavior that emerges from the need to complete real-world tasks. We
develop a mechanical eyeball that can freely rotate to observe its surroundings
and train a gaze policy to control it using reinforcement learning. We
accomplish this by first collecting teleoperated demonstrations paired with a
360 camera. This data is imported into a simulation environment that supports
rendering arbitrary eyeball viewpoints, allowing episode rollouts of eye gaze
on top of robot demonstrations. We then introduce a BC-RL loop to train the
hand and eye jointly: the hand (BC) agent is trained from rendered eye
observations, and the eye (RL) agent is rewarded when the hand produces correct
action predictions. In this way, hand-eye coordination emerges as the eye looks
towards regions which allow the hand to complete the task. EyeRobot implements
a foveal-inspired policy architecture allowing high resolution with a small
compute budget, which we find also leads to the emergence of more stable
fixation as well as improved ability to track objects and ignore distractors.
We evaluate EyeRobot on five panoramic workspace manipulation tasks requiring
manipulation in an arc surrounding the robot arm. Our experiments suggest
EyeRobot exhibits hand-eye coordination behaviors which effectively facilitate
manipulation over large workspaces with a single camera. See project site for

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在视频编辑性能上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了高效且灵活的视频编辑，同时保留了背景区域。

Abstract: Video editing using diffusion models has achieved remarkable results in
generating high-quality edits for videos. However, current methods often rely
on large-scale pretraining, limiting flexibility for specific edits.
First-frame-guided editing provides control over the first frame, but lacks
flexibility over subsequent frames. To address this, we propose a mask-based
LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) tuning method that adapts pretrained Image-to-Video
(I2V) models for flexible video editing. Our approach preserves background
regions while enabling controllable edits propagation. This solution offers
efficient and adaptable video editing without altering the model architecture.
To better steer this process, we incorporate additional references, such as
alternate viewpoints or representative scene states, which serve as visual
anchors for how content should unfold. We address the control challenge using a
mask-driven LoRA tuning strategy that adapts a pre-trained image-to-video model
to the editing context. The model must learn from two distinct sources: the
input video provides spatial structure and motion cues, while reference images
offer appearance guidance. A spatial mask enables region-specific learning by
dynamically modulating what the model attends to, ensuring that each area draws
from the appropriate source. Experimental results show our method achieves
superior video editing performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 在多个图像分类基准测试中，DeepTraverse表现出色，分类准确性和特征判别力优于传统模型。

Conclusion: 集成算法先验为构建更高效、性能更强、结构化的视觉主干提供了有效策略。

Abstract: Conventional vision backbones, despite their success, often construct
features through a largely uniform cascade of operations, offering limited
explicit pathways for adaptive, iterative refinement. This raises a compelling
question: can principles from classical search algorithms instill a more
algorithmic, structured, and logical processing flow within these networks,
leading to representations built through more interpretable, perhaps
reasoning-like decision processes? We introduce DeepTraverse, a novel vision
architecture directly inspired by algorithmic search strategies, enabling it to
learn features through a process of systematic elucidation and adaptive
refinement distinct from conventional approaches. DeepTraverse operationalizes
this via two key synergistic components: recursive exploration modules that
methodically deepen feature analysis along promising representational paths
with parameter sharing for efficiency, and adaptive calibration modules that
dynamically adjust feature salience based on evolving global context. The
resulting algorithmic interplay allows DeepTraverse to intelligently construct
and refine feature patterns. Comprehensive evaluations across a diverse suite
of image classification benchmarks show that DeepTraverse achieves highly
competitive classification accuracy and robust feature discrimination, often
outperforming conventional models with similar or larger parameter counts. Our
work demonstrates that integrating such algorithmic priors provides a
principled and effective strategy for building more efficient, performant, and
structured vision backbones.

Result: 在CogACT模型上实现1.93倍加速，FLOPs降至28.9%，SIMPLER基准成功率仅下降0.6%。

Conclusion: EfficientVLA通过协同优化多层面冗余，显著提升VLA模型的实用性和部署效率。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, particularly diffusion-based
architectures, demonstrate transformative potential for embodied intelligence
but are severely hampered by high computational and memory demands stemming
from extensive inherent and inference-time redundancies. While existing
acceleration efforts often target isolated inefficiencies, such piecemeal
solutions typically fail to holistically address the varied computational and
memory bottlenecks across the entire VLA pipeline, thereby limiting practical
deployability. We introduce EfficientVLA, a structured and training-free
inference acceleration framework that systematically eliminates these barriers
by cohesively exploiting multifaceted redundancies. EfficientVLA
synergistically integrates three targeted strategies: (1) pruning of
functionally inconsequential layers from the language module, guided by an
analysis of inter-layer redundancies; (2) optimizing the visual processing
pathway through a task-aware strategy that selects a compact, diverse set of
visual tokens, balancing task-criticality with informational coverage; and (3)
alleviating temporal computational redundancy within the iterative
diffusion-based action head by strategically caching and reusing key
intermediate features. We apply our method to a standard VLA model CogACT,
yielding a 1.93X inference speedup and reduces FLOPs to 28.9%, with only a 0.6%
success rate drop in the SIMPLER benchmark.

Abstract: Platforms and the law regulate digital content depicting minors (defined as

Given the sheer amount of content that needs to be assessed, machine

this gap, we release the Image-Caption Children in the Wild Dataset (ICCWD), an

minors. Our dataset is richer than previous child image datasets, containing
images of children in a variety of contexts, including fictional depictions and
partially visible bodies. ICCWD contains 10,000 image-caption pairs manually
labeled to indicate the presence or absence of a child in the image. To
demonstrate the possible utility of our dataset, we use it to benchmark three
different detectors, including a commercial age estimation system applied to
images. Our results suggest that child detection is a challenging task, with
the best method achieving a 75.3% true positive rate. We hope the release of
our dataset will aid in the design of better minor detection methods in a wide
range of scenarios.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great effectiveness for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs) using tasks that are challenging yet easily
verifiable, such as math reasoning or code generation. However, extending this
success to visual perception in vision-language models (VLMs) has been impeded
by the scarcity of vision-centric tasks that are simultaneously challenging and
unambiguously verifiable. To this end, we introduce ViCrit (Visual Caption
Hallucination Critic), an RL proxy task that trains VLMs to localize a subtle,
synthetic visual hallucination injected into paragraphs of human-written image
captions. Starting from a 200-word captions, we inject a single, subtle visual
description error-altering a few words on objects, attributes, counts, or
spatial relations-and task the model to pinpoint the corrupted span given the
image and the modified caption. This formulation preserves the full perceptual
difficulty while providing a binary, exact-match reward that is easy to compute
and unambiguous. Models trained with the ViCrit Task exhibit substantial gains
across a variety of VL benchmarks. Crucially, the improvements transfer beyond
natural-image training data to abstract image reasoning and visual math,
showing promises of learning to perceive rather than barely memorizing seen
objects. To facilitate evaluation, we further introduce ViCrit-Bench, a
category-balanced diagnostic benchmark that systematically probes perception
errors across diverse image domains and error types. Together, our results
demonstrate that fine-grained hallucination criticism is an effective and
generalizable objective for enhancing visual perception in VLMs.

Conclusion: RoCA在跨域场景中表现出强大的泛化和适应能力，为自动驾驶部署提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving has recently emerged as a new paradigm,
offering significant potential. However, few studies have looked into the
practical challenge of deployment across domains (e.g., cities). Although
several works have incorporated Large Language Models (LLMs) to leverage their
open-world knowledge, LLMs do not guarantee cross-domain driving performance
and may incur prohibitive retraining costs during domain adaptation. In this
paper, we propose RoCA, a novel framework for robust cross-domain E2E
autonomous driving. RoCA formulates the joint probabilistic distribution over
the tokens that encode ego and surrounding vehicle information in the E2E
pipeline. Instantiating with a Gaussian process (GP), RoCA learns a set of
basis tokens with corresponding trajectories, which span diverse driving
scenarios. Then, given any driving scene, it is able to probabilistically infer
the future trajectory. By using RoCA together with a base E2E model in
source-domain training, we improve the generalizability of the base model,
without requiring extra inference computation. In addition, RoCA enables robust
adaptation on new target domains, significantly outperforming direct
finetuning. We extensively evaluate RoCA on various cross-domain scenarios and
show that it achieves strong domain generalization and adaptation performance.

TL;DR: DanceChat利用大型语言模型（LLM）作为编舞指导，通过文本指令生成多样且与音乐风格对齐的舞蹈动作，解决了音乐与舞蹈之间的语义鸿沟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音乐与舞蹈之间存在语义鸿沟，音乐仅提供抽象线索（如旋律、节奏、情感），无法明确指定具体动作。此外，单一音乐可能对应多种舞蹈解释，且配对数据稀缺，限制了模型学习多样性。

Method: DanceChat包含三个模块：(1) LLM生成伪指令，(2) 多模态特征提取与融合，(3) 基于扩散的动作合成与对齐损失。

Result: 在AIST++数据集和人类评估中，DanceChat在质量和多样性上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DanceChat通过LLM的显式指导，显著提升了舞蹈生成的多样性和音乐对齐性。

Abstract: Music-to-dance generation aims to synthesize human dance motion conditioned
on musical input. Despite recent progress, significant challenges remain due to
the semantic gap between music and dance motion, as music offers only abstract
cues, such as melody, groove, and emotion, without explicitly specifying the
physical movements. Moreover, a single piece of music can produce multiple
plausible dance interpretations. This one-to-many mapping demands additional
guidance, as music alone provides limited information for generating diverse
dance movements. The challenge is further amplified by the scarcity of paired
music and dance data, which restricts the model\^a\u{A}\'Zs ability to learn
diverse dance patterns. In this paper, we introduce DanceChat, a Large Language
Model (LLM)-guided music-to-dance generation approach. We use an LLM as a
choreographer that provides textual motion instructions, offering explicit,
high-level guidance for dance generation. This approach goes beyond implicit
learning from music alone, enabling the model to generate dance that is both
more diverse and better aligned with musical styles. Our approach consists of
three components: (1) an LLM-based pseudo instruction generation module that
produces textual dance guidance based on music style and structure, (2) a
multi-modal feature extraction and fusion module that integrates music, rhythm,
and textual guidance into a shared representation, and (3) a diffusion-based
motion synthesis module together with a multi-modal alignment loss, which
ensures that the generated dance is aligned with both musical and textual cues.
Extensive experiments on AIST++ and human evaluations show that DanceChat
outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Method: 提出SPARKE方法，利用条件熵进行多样性引导，并通过优化计算复杂度从O(n^3)降至O(n)。

Result: 实验表明SPARKE能显著提升生成数据的多样性，且计算成本低。

Conclusion: SPARKE是一种高效且可扩展的提示感知多样性引导方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in high-fidelity image
synthesis and prompt-guided generative modeling. However, ensuring adequate
diversity in generated samples of prompt-guided diffusion models remains a
challenge, particularly when the prompts span a broad semantic spectrum and the
diversity of generated data needs to be evaluated in a prompt-aware fashion
across semantically similar prompts. Recent methods have introduced guidance
via diversity measures to encourage more varied generations. In this work, we
extend the diversity measure-based approaches by proposing the Scalable
Prompt-Aware R\'eny Kernel Entropy Diversity Guidance (SPARKE) method for
prompt-aware diversity guidance. SPARKE utilizes conditional entropy for
diversity guidance, which dynamically conditions diversity measurement on
similar prompts and enables prompt-aware diversity control. While the
entropy-based guidance approach enhances prompt-aware diversity, its reliance
on the matrix-based entropy scores poses computational challenges in
large-scale generation settings. To address this, we focus on the special case
of Conditional latent RKE Score Guidance, reducing entropy computation and
gradient-based optimization complexity from the $O(n^3)$ of general entropy
measures to $O(n)$. The reduced computational complexity allows for
diversity-guided sampling over potentially thousands of generation rounds on
different prompts. We numerically test the SPARKE method on several
text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the proposed method improves
the prompt-aware diversity of the generated data without incurring significant
computational costs. We release our code on the project page:

<details>

Motivation: 传统方法依赖月度统计估算晴空地表反射率，在山区因雪覆盖动态变化而失效，需更精确的解决方案。

Method: 采用Temporo-Spatial Vision Transformer构建注意力模拟器，无需手工特征（如反照率图或云掩膜），输入多光谱卫星图像、地形特征和太阳几何数据。

Result: 模型在足够长的时间上下文下性能与反照率模型相当，尤其在山区表现突出，提升了复杂地形下的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过隐式学习地表反射率动态，显著提升了山区SSR检索精度，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Accurate retrieval of surface solar radiation (SSR) from satellite imagery
critically depends on estimating the background reflectance that a spaceborne
sensor would observe under clear-sky conditions. Deviations from this baseline
can then be used to detect cloud presence and guide radiative transfer models
in inferring atmospheric attenuation. Operational retrieval algorithms
typically approximate background reflectance using monthly statistics, assuming
surface properties vary slowly relative to atmospheric conditions. However,
this approach fails in mountainous regions where intermittent snow cover and
changing snow surfaces are frequent. We propose an attention-based emulator for
SSR retrieval that implicitly learns to infer clear-sky surface reflectance
from raw satellite image sequences. Built on the Temporo-Spatial Vision
Transformer, our approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted features such as
explicit albedo maps or cloud masks. The emulator is trained on instantaneous
SSR estimates from the HelioMont algorithm over Switzerland, a region
characterized by complex terrain and dynamic snow cover. Inputs include
multi-spectral SEVIRI imagery from the Meteosat Second Generation platform,
augmented with static topographic features and solar geometry. The target
variable is HelioMont's SSR, computed as the sum of its direct and diffuse
horizontal irradiance components, given at a spatial resolution of 1.7 km. We
show that, when provided a sufficiently long temporal context, the model
matches the performances of albedo-informed models, highlighting the model's
ability to internally learn and exploit latent surface reflectance dynamics.
Our geospatial analysis shows this effect is most powerful in mountainous
regions and improves generalization in both simple and complex topographic
settings. Code and datasets are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于线性探测（LP）无法充分评估掩码图像建模（MIM）模型的潜力，且现有注意力探测方法存在参数过多和计算效率低的问题，需要一种更高效的探测方法。

Method: 提出高效探测（EP），采用多查询交叉注意力机制，减少冗余投影和可训练参数，提升计算效率。

Result: EP在七个基准测试中优于LP和现有注意力探测方法，计算速度提升10倍，且适用于多种预训练范式。

Conclusion: EP是一种高效且通用的探测方法，适用于低样本和分层设置，并能生成可解释的注意力图。

Abstract: As fine-tuning (FT) becomes increasingly impractical at scale, probing is
emerging as the preferred evaluation protocol for self-supervised learning
(SSL). Yet, the standard linear probing (LP) fails to adequately reflect the
potential of models trained with Masked Image Modeling (MIM), due to the
distributed nature of patch tokens. This motivates the need for attentive
probing, an alternative that uses attention to selectively aggregate
patch-level features. Despite its growing adoption, attentive probing remains
under-explored, with existing methods suffering from excessive parameterization
and poor computational efficiency.
  In this work, we revisit attentive probing through the lens of the
accuracy-efficiency trade-off. We conduct a systematic study of existing
methods, analyzing their mechanisms and benchmarking their performance. We
introduce efficient probing (EP), a multi-query cross-attention mechanism that
eliminates redundant projections, reduces the number of trainable parameters,
and achieves up to a 10$\times$ speed-up over conventional multi-head
attention. Despite its simplicity, EP outperforms LP and prior attentive
probing approaches across seven benchmarks, generalizes well beyond MIM to
diverse pre-training paradigms, produces interpretable attention maps, and
achieves strong gains in low-shot and layer-wise settings. Code available at

Result: 在两个基准测试中，个性化检索准确率比现有方法提升4%-22%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在个性化视觉语言检索中表现优异，有效平衡了新概念学习与通用知识保留。

Abstract: Personalized vision-language retrieval seeks to recognize new concepts (e.g.
"my dog Fido") from only a few examples. This task is challenging because it
requires not only learning a new concept from a few images, but also
integrating the personal and general knowledge together to recognize the
concept in different contexts. In this paper, we show how to effectively adapt
the internal representation of a vision-language dual encoder model for
personalized vision-language retrieval. We find that regularized low-rank
adaption of a small set of parameters in the language encoder's final layer
serves as a highly effective alternative to textual inversion for recognizing
the personal concept while preserving general knowledge. Additionally, we
explore strategies for combining parameters of multiple learned personal
concepts, finding that parameter addition is effective. To evaluate how well
general knowledge is preserved in a finetuned representation, we introduce a
metric that measures image retrieval accuracy based on captions generated by a
vision language model (VLM). Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on
two benchmarks for personalized image retrieval with natural language queries -
DeepFashion2 and ConCon-Chi - outperforming the prior art by 4%-22% on personal
retrievals.

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著提升判别器性能，且发现混合类别在判别器嵌入空间中距离较远时效果更佳。

Conclusion: ScoreMix无需大量参数搜索即可显著提升性能，为训练判别模型提供了一种实用且高效的方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose ScoreMix, a novel yet simple data augmentation
strategy leveraging the score compositional properties of diffusion models to
enhance discriminator performance, particularly under scenarios with limited
labeled data. By convexly mixing the scores from different class-conditioned
trajectories during diffusion sampling, we generate challenging synthetic
samples that significantly improve discriminative capabilities in all studied
benchmarks. We systematically investigate class-selection strategies for mixing
and discover that greater performance gains arise when combining classes
distant in the discriminator's embedding space, rather than close in the
generator's condition space. Moreover, we empirically show that, under standard
metrics, the correlation between the generator's learned condition space and
the discriminator's embedding space is minimal. Our approach achieves notable
performance improvements without extensive parameter searches, demonstrating
practical advantages for training discriminative models while effectively
mitigating problems regarding collections of large datasets. Paper website:

Abstract: California is a global leader in agricultural production, contributing 12.5%
of the United States total output and ranking as the fifth-largest food and
cotton supplier in the world. Despite the availability of extensive historical
yield data from the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service, accurate and
timely crop yield forecasting remains a challenge due to the complex interplay
of environmental, climatic, and soil-related factors. In this study, we
introduce a comprehensive crop yield benchmark dataset covering over 70 crops
across all California counties from 2008 to 2022. The benchmark integrates
diverse data sources, including Landsat satellite imagery, daily climate
records, monthly evapotranspiration, and high-resolution soil properties. To
effectively learn from these heterogeneous inputs, we develop a multi-modal
deep learning model tailored for county-level, crop-specific yield forecasting.
The model employs stratified feature extraction and a timeseries encoder to
capture spatial and temporal dynamics during the growing season. Static inputs
such as soil characteristics and crop identity inform long-term variability.
Our approach achieves an overall R2 score of 0.76 across all crops of unseen
test dataset, highlighting strong predictive performance across California
diverse agricultural regions. This benchmark and modeling framework offer a
valuable foundation for advancing agricultural forecasting, climate adaptation,
and precision farming. The full dataset and codebase are publicly available at

Conclusion: DySS在性能和效率上均优于现有方法，适用于自动驾驶感知任务。

Abstract: Camera-based 3D object detection in Bird's Eye View (BEV) is one of the most
important perception tasks in autonomous driving. Earlier methods rely on dense
BEV features, which are costly to construct. More recent works explore sparse
query-based detection. However, they still require a large number of queries
and can become expensive to run when more video frames are used. In this paper,
we propose DySS, a novel method that employs state-space learning and dynamic
queries. More specifically, DySS leverages a state-space model (SSM) to
sequentially process the sampled features over time steps. In order to
encourage the model to better capture the underlying motion and correspondence
information, we introduce auxiliary tasks of future prediction and masked
reconstruction to better train the SSM. The state of the SSM then provides an
informative yet efficient summarization of the scene. Based on the state-space
learned features, we dynamically update the queries via merge, remove, and
split operations, which help maintain a useful, lean set of detection queries
throughout the network. Our proposed DySS achieves both superior detection
performance and efficient inference. Specifically, on the nuScenes test split,
DySS achieves 65.31 NDS and 57.4 mAP, outperforming the latest state of the
art. On the val split, DySS achieves 56.2 NDS and 46.2 mAP, as well as a
real-time inference speed of 33 FPS.

Conclusion: HalLoc为增强视觉语言模型的可信度提供了新途径，其数据和代码已公开。

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a significant challenge to the reliability of large
vision-language models, making their detection essential for ensuring accuracy
in critical applications. Current detection methods often rely on
computationally intensive models, leading to high latency and resource demands.
Their definitive outcomes also fail to account for real-world scenarios where
the line between hallucinated and truthful information is unclear. To address
these issues, we propose HalLoc, a dataset designed for efficient,
probabilistic hallucination detection. It features 150K token-level annotated
samples, including hallucination types, across Visual Question Answering (VQA),
instruction-following, and image captioning tasks. This dataset facilitates the
development of models that detect hallucinations with graded confidence,
enabling more informed user interactions. Additionally, we introduce a baseline
model trained on HalLoc, offering low-overhead, concurrent hallucination
detection during generation. The model can be seamlessly integrated into
existing VLMs, improving reliability while preserving efficiency. The prospect
of a robust plug-and-play hallucination detection module opens new avenues for
enhancing the trustworthiness of vision-language models in real-world
applications. The HalLoc dataset and code are publicly available at:

Abstract: Accurate and reliable skin cancer diagnosis is critical for early treatment
and improved patient outcomes. Deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in
automating skin cancer classification, but their performance can be limited by
data scarcity and a lack of uncertainty awareness. In this study, we present a
comprehensive evaluation of DL-based skin lesion classification using transfer
learning and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on the HAM10000 dataset. In the
first phase, we benchmarked several pre-trained feature extractors-including
Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) variants, Residual Network-50
(ResNet50), Densely Connected Convolutional Network (DenseNet121), Visual
Geometry Group network (VGG16), and EfficientNet-V2-Large-combined with a range
of traditional classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), eXtreme
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and logistic regression. Our results show that
CLIP-based vision transformers, particularly LAION CLIP ViT-H/14 with SVM,
deliver the highest classification performance. In the second phase, we
incorporated UQ using Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), Ensemble, and Ensemble Monte
Carlo Dropout (EMCD) to assess not only prediction accuracy but also the
reliability of model outputs. We evaluated these models using uncertainty-aware
metrics such as uncertainty accuracy(UAcc), uncertainty sensitivity(USen),
uncertainty specificity(USpe), and uncertainty precision(UPre). The results
demonstrate that ensemble methods offer a good trade-off between accuracy and
uncertainty handling, while EMCD is more sensitive to uncertain predictions.
This study highlights the importance of integrating UQ into DL-based medical
diagnosis to enhance both performance and trustworthiness in real-world
clinical applications.

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展临床文档生成，减轻医生负担，减少对大标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: Skin carcinoma is the most prevalent form of cancer globally, accounting for
over $8 billion in annual healthcare expenditures. In clinical settings,
physicians document patient visits using detailed SOAP (Subjective, Objective,
Assessment, and Plan) notes. However, manually generating these notes is
labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout. In this work, we propose
a weakly supervised multimodal framework to generate clinically structured SOAP
notes from limited inputs, including lesion images and sparse clinical text.
Our approach reduces reliance on manual annotations, enabling scalable,
clinically grounded documentation while alleviating clinician burden and
reducing the need for large annotated data. Our method achieves performance

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着全向视频从专业生成内容转向用户生成内容，其视听质量评估研究不足，亟需解决。

Method: 构建了包含300个视频的UGC数据集，通过主观实验获取MOS评分，并设计了包含视频特征提取、音频特征提取和视听融合模块的基线模型。

Result: 实验表明，基线模型在提出的数据集上表现最优。

Conclusion: 该研究为UGC-ODV的AVQA领域提供了数据集和有效的基线模型。

Abstract: In response to the rising prominence of the Metaverse, omnidirectional videos
(ODVs) have garnered notable interest, gradually shifting from
professional-generated content (PGC) to user-generated content (UGC). However,
the study of audio-visual quality assessment (AVQA) within ODVs remains
limited. To address this, we construct a dataset of UGC omnidirectional audio
and video (A/V) content. The videos are captured by five individuals using two
different types of omnidirectional cameras, shooting 300 videos covering 10
different scene types. A subjective AVQA experiment is conducted on the dataset
to obtain the Mean Opinion Scores (MOSs) of the A/V sequences. After that, to
facilitate the development of UGC-ODV AVQA fields, we construct an effective
AVQA baseline model on the proposed dataset, of which the baseline model
consists of video feature extraction module, audio feature extraction and
audio-visual fusion module. The experimental results demonstrate that our model
achieves optimal performance on the proposed dataset.

### [47] [Using Vision Language Models to Detect Students' Academic Emotion through Facial Expressions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10334)
*Deliang Wang,Chao Yang,Gaowei Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了视觉语言模型（VLMs）在学生学术情绪分析中的应用，发现其在零样本提示下能有效识别部分情绪，但存在局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督学习方法难以泛化到不同情境，而VLMs提供了一种无需微调即可跨任务泛化的新方法。

Method: 使用Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct和Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct两种VLMs，通过零样本提示分析5000张学生面部表情图像。

Result: Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct表现优于Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct，尤其在识别快乐和困惑情绪上表现突出，但无法检测分心行为。

Conclusion: VLMs在学术情绪分析中具有潜力，尤其是Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct，但需进一步优化以提升泛化能力。

Abstract: Students' academic emotions significantly influence their social behavior and
learning performance. Traditional approaches to automatically and accurately
analyze these emotions have predominantly relied on supervised machine learning
algorithms. However, these models often struggle to generalize across different
contexts, necessitating repeated cycles of data collection, annotation, and
training. The emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offers a promising
alternative, enabling generalization across visual recognition tasks through
zero-shot prompting without requiring fine-tuning. This study investigates the
potential of VLMs to analyze students' academic emotions via facial expressions
in an online learning environment. We employed two VLMs,
Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, to analyze 5,000
images depicting confused, distracted, happy, neutral, and tired expressions
using zero-shot prompting. Preliminary results indicate that both models
demonstrate moderate performance in academic facial expression recognition,
with Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct outperforming Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct.
Notably, both models excel in identifying students' happy emotions but fail to
detect distracted behavior. Additionally, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct exhibits
relatively high performance in recognizing students' confused expressions,
highlighting its potential for practical applications in identifying content
that causes student confusion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于点特征感知的高斯泼溅框架，解决了3D高斯泼溅在稀疏视图输入下过拟合的问题，实现了实时高质量渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯泼溅方法需要大量校准视图，稀疏输入时易过拟合，导致渲染质量下降。

Method: 利用立体基础模型估计相机位姿和密集点云，通过多尺度2D特征采样和自注意力点交互网络增强高斯点表示，最后用轻量MLP解码渲染。

Result: 在多样基准测试中显著优于NeRF方法，并在少样本设置下与最先进的3DGS方法竞争。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了稀疏视图输入下的渲染质量问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) is an innovative rendering technique that
surpasses the neural radiance field (NeRF) in both rendering speed and visual
quality by leveraging an explicit 3D scene representation. Existing 3DGS
approaches require a large number of calibrated views to generate a consistent
and complete scene representation. When input views are limited, 3DGS tends to
overfit the training views, leading to noticeable degradation in rendering
quality. To address this limitation, we propose a Point-wise Feature-Aware
Gaussian Splatting framework that enables real-time, high-quality rendering
from sparse training views. Specifically, we first employ the latest stereo
foundation model to estimate accurate camera poses and reconstruct a dense
point cloud for Gaussian initialization. We then encode the colour attributes
of each 3D Gaussian by sampling and aggregating multiscale 2D appearance
features from sparse inputs. To enhance point-wise appearance representation,
we design a point interaction network based on a self-attention mechanism,
allowing each Gaussian point to interact with its nearest neighbors. These
enriched features are subsequently decoded into Gaussian parameters through two
lightweight multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for final rendering. Extensive
experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms NeRF-based approaches and achieves competitive performance under
few-shot settings compared to the state-of-the-art 3DGS methods.

TL;DR: GeoCAD是一种用户友好的局部几何可控CAD生成方法，通过互补标注策略和LLM预测，实现高质量、有效的局部修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以根据文本指令修改CAD模型的局部几何形状，限制了设计效率。

Method: 提出互补标注策略（顶点和VLLM标注），训练时随机掩码局部部分，利用LLM预测；推理时用户可指定局部修改。

Result: 实验证明GeoCAD在生成质量、有效性和文本-CAD一致性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: GeoCAD解决了局部几何可控生成的挑战，代码将开源。

Abstract: Local geometry-controllable computer-aided design (CAD) generation aims to
modify local parts of CAD models automatically, enhancing design efficiency. It
also ensures that the shapes of newly generated local parts follow
user-specific geometric instructions (e.g., an isosceles right triangle or a
rectangle with one corner cut off). However, existing methods encounter
challenges in achieving this goal. Specifically, they either lack the ability
to follow textual instructions or are unable to focus on the local parts. To
address this limitation, we introduce GeoCAD, a user-friendly and local
geometry-controllable CAD generation method. Specifically, we first propose a
complementary captioning strategy to generate geometric instructions for local
parts. This strategy involves vertex-based and VLLM-based captioning for
systematically annotating simple and complex parts, respectively. In this way,
we caption $\sim$221k different local parts in total. In the training stage,
given a CAD model, we randomly mask a local part. Then, using its geometric
instruction and the remaining parts as input, we prompt large language models
(LLMs) to predict the masked part. During inference, users can specify any
local part for modification while adhering to a variety of predefined geometric
instructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GeoCAD in
generation quality, validity and text-to-CAD consistency. Code will be
available at https://github.com/Zhanwei-Z/GeoCAD.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉语言模型的多模态研究框架，用于自动化分析城市街景风格差异，并构建了数据集和框架UrbanSense，实验结果显示方法能有效捕捉风格差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市文化和建筑风格因地理、历史和社会政治因素差异显著，传统研究方法依赖专家解释和历史文献，难以标准化。

Method: 提出基于视觉语言模型的多模态框架UrbanSense，构建数据集UrbanDiffBench，实现城市风格的定量生成与比较。

Result: 实验显示80%以上生成的描述通过t检验，主观评价Phi分数高（城市0.912，时期0.833），证实方法能捕捉细微风格差异。

Conclusion: 该方法为量化城市风格演变提供了科学依据，对未来设计具有指导意义。

Abstract: Urban cultures and architectural styles vary significantly across cities due
to geographical, chronological, historical, and socio-political factors.
Understanding these differences is essential for anticipating how cities may
evolve in the future. As representative cases of historical continuity and
modern innovation in China, Beijing and Shenzhen offer valuable perspectives
for exploring the transformation of urban streetscapes. However, conventional
approaches to urban cultural studies often rely on expert interpretation and
historical documentation, which are difficult to standardize across different
contexts. To address this, we propose a multimodal research framework based on
vision-language models, enabling automated and scalable analysis of urban
streetscape style differences. This approach enhances the objectivity and
data-driven nature of urban form research. The contributions of this study are
as follows: First, we construct UrbanDiffBench, a curated dataset of urban
streetscapes containing architectural images from different periods and
regions. Second, we develop UrbanSense, the first vision-language-model-based
framework for urban streetscape analysis, enabling the quantitative generation
and comparison of urban style representations. Third, experimental results show
that Over 80% of generated descriptions pass the t-test (p less than 0.05).
High Phi scores (0.912 for cities, 0.833 for periods) from subjective
evaluations confirm the method's ability to capture subtle stylistic
differences. These results highlight the method's potential to quantify and
interpret urban style evolution, offering a scientifically grounded lens for
future design.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RealKeyMorph (RKM) 是一种分辨率无关的医学图像配准方法，避免了传统方法因重采样引入的伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习配准方法需将图像重采样至固定分辨率，可能引入插值伪影，影响配准效果。

Method: RKM 扩展了 KeyMorph 框架，通过输出真实世界坐标的关键点，利用扫描仪的仿射矩阵实现分辨率无关配准。

Result: 实验证明 RKM 在腹部 MRI 和不同分辨率脑数据集上表现优越。

Conclusion: RKM 提供了一种更优的医学图像配准方案，避免了重采样的负面影响。

Abstract: Many real-world settings require registration of a pair of medical images
that differ in spatial resolution, which may arise from differences in image
acquisition parameters like pixel spacing, slice thickness, and field-of-view.
However, all previous machine learning-based registration techniques resample
images onto a fixed resolution. This is suboptimal because resampling can
introduce artifacts due to interpolation. To address this, we present
RealKeyMorph (RKM), a resolution-agnostic method for image registration. RKM is
an extension of KeyMorph, a registration framework which works by training a
network to learn corresponding keypoints for a given pair of images, after
which a closed-form keypoint matching step is used to derive the transformation
that aligns them. To avoid resampling and enable operating on the raw data, RKM
outputs keypoints in real-world coordinates of the scanner. To do this, we
leverage the affine matrix produced by the scanner (e.g., MRI machine) that
encodes the mapping from voxel coordinates to real world coordinates. By
transforming keypoints into real-world space and integrating this into the
training process, RKM effectively enables the extracted keypoints to be
resolution-agnostic. In our experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of RKM
on the registration task for orthogonal 2D stacks of abdominal MRIs, as well as
3D volumes with varying resolutions in brain datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在语义对齐和运动合成上依赖端到端映射，缺乏对深层语言结构和逻辑推理的捕捉，导致生成的运动缺乏可控性、一致性和多样性。

Method: 提出Motion-R1框架，结合Chain-of-Thought机制分解指令，采用Group Relative Policy Optimization算法联合优化推理链和运动合成。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，尤其在需要细致语义理解和长期时间一致性的场景中。

Conclusion: Motion-R1通过结构化推理显著提升了运动生成的质量和多样性，代码和模型将公开。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models, especially in natural language
understanding and reasoning, have opened new possibilities for text-to-motion
generation. Although existing approaches have made notable progress in semantic
alignment and motion synthesis, they often rely on end-to-end mapping
strategies that fail to capture deep linguistic structures and logical
reasoning. Consequently, generated motions tend to lack controllability,
consistency, and diversity. To address these limitations, we propose Motion-R1,
a unified motion-language modeling framework that integrates a Chain-of-Thought
mechanism. By explicitly decomposing complex textual instructions into
logically structured action paths, Motion-R1 provides high-level semantic
guidance for motion generation, significantly enhancing the model's ability to
interpret and execute multi-step, long-horizon, and compositionally rich
commands. To train our model, we adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization, a
reinforcement learning algorithm designed for large models, which leverages
motion quality feedback to optimize reasoning chains and motion synthesis
jointly. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that Motion-R1 achieves competitive or superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios requiring nuanced semantic
understanding and long-term temporal coherence. The code, model and data will
be publicly available.

performance compared to state-of-the-art lightweight models. MHLA notably
improves inference speed, allowing FaceLiVT to deliver high accuracy with lower
latency on mobile devices. Specifically, FaceLiVT is 8.6 faster than EdgeFace,
a recent hybrid CNN-Transformer model optimized for edge devices, and 21.2
faster than a pure ViT-Based model. With its balanced design, FaceLiVT offers
an efficient and practical solution for real-time face recognition on

Conclusion: FSATFusion通过创新的模块设计显著提升了红外与可见光图像融合的性能，并具备广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: The infrared and visible images fusion (IVIF) is receiving increasing
attention from both the research community and industry due to its excellent
results in downstream applications. Existing deep learning approaches often
utilize convolutional neural networks to extract image features. However, the
inherently capacity of convolution operations to capture global context can
lead to information loss, thereby restricting fusion performance. To address
this limitation, we propose an end-to-end fusion network named the
Frequency-Spatial Attention Transformer Fusion Network (FSATFusion). The
FSATFusion contains a frequency-spatial attention Transformer (FSAT) module
designed to effectively capture discriminate features from source images. This
FSAT module includes a frequency-spatial attention mechanism (FSAM) capable of
extracting significant features from feature maps. Additionally, we propose an
improved Transformer module (ITM) to enhance the ability to extract global
context information of vanilla Transformer. We conducted both qualitative and
quantitative comparative experiments, demonstrating the superior fusion quality
and efficiency of FSATFusion compared to other state-of-the-art methods.
Furthermore, our network was tested on two additional tasks without any
modifications, to verify the excellent generalization capability of FSATFusion.
Finally, the object detection experiment demonstrated the superiority of
FSATFusion in downstream visual tasks. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 本文通过图像处理框架增强了自注意力机制的可解释性，同时其改进的架构在实际任务中表现出色。

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism, a cornerstone of Transformer-based
state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, is largely heuristic-driven and
fundamentally challenging to interpret. Establishing a robust theoretical
foundation to explain its remarkable success and limitations has therefore
become an increasingly prominent focus in recent research. Some notable
directions have explored understanding self-attention through the lens of image
denoising and nonparametric regression. While promising, existing frameworks
still lack a deeper mechanistic interpretation of various architectural
components that enhance self-attention, both in its original formulation and
subsequent variants. In this work, we aim to advance this understanding by
developing a unifying image processing framework, capable of explaining not
only the self-attention computation itself but also the role of components such
as positional encoding and residual connections, including numerous later
variants. We also pinpoint potential distinctions between the two concepts
building upon our framework, and make effort to close this gap. We introduce
two independent architectural modifications within transformers. While our
primary objective is interpretability, we empirically observe that image
processing-inspired modifications can also lead to notably improved accuracy
and robustness against data contamination and adversaries across language and
vision tasks as well as better long sequence understanding.

Motivation: 准确估计海底人为物体的埋藏状态对研究局部沉积动力学、评估生态风险、污染物迁移以及危险材料（如弹药）的回收或缓解策略至关重要。

Method: 结合深度基础模型特征与多视角摄影测量技术，通过对齐CAD模型与观测图像并拟合局部平面近似海底，推断埋藏深度。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了海底埋藏状态的非侵入式、可扩展测绘，为污染场地的环境评估提供了支持。

Abstract: The burial state of anthropogenic objects on the seafloor provides insight
into localized sedimentation dynamics and is also critical for assessing
ecological risks, potential pollutant transport, and the viability of recovery
or mitigation strategies for hazardous materials such as munitions. Accurate
burial depth estimation from remote imagery remains difficult due to partial
occlusion, poor visibility, and object degradation. This work introduces a
computer vision pipeline, called PoseIDON, which combines deep foundation model
features with multiview photogrammetry to estimate six degrees of freedom
object pose and the orientation of the surrounding seafloor from ROV video.
Burial depth is inferred by aligning CAD models of the objects with observed
imagery and fitting a local planar approximation of the seafloor. The method is
validated using footage of 54 objects, including barrels and munitions,
recorded at a historic ocean dumpsite in the San Pedro Basin. The model
achieves a mean burial depth error of approximately 10 centimeters and resolves
spatial burial patterns that reflect underlying sediment transport processes.
This approach enables scalable, non-invasive mapping of seafloor burial and
supports environmental assessment at contaminated sites.

Result: 在DeiT（ImageNet-1K）上准确率提升2.1%，计算量减少45%，性能更优。

Conclusion: DART是一种高效的方法，能持续提升准确性，同时计算开销最小甚至减少。

Abstract: Recently, non-convolutional models such as the Vision Transformer (ViT) and
Vision Mamba (Vim) have achieved remarkable performance in computer vision
tasks. However, their reliance on fixed-size patches often results in excessive
encoding of background regions and omission of critical local details,
especially when informative objects are sparsely distributed. To address this,
we introduce a fully differentiable Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer (DART),
which adaptively partitions images into content-dependent patches of varying
sizes. DART combines learnable region scores with piecewise differentiable
quantile operations to allocate denser tokens to information-rich areas.
Despite introducing only approximately 1 million (1M) additional parameters,
DART improves accuracy by 2.1% on DeiT (ImageNet-1K). Unlike methods that
uniformly increase token density to capture fine-grained details, DART offers a
more efficient alternative, achieving 45% FLOPs reduction with superior
performance. Extensive experiments on DeiT, Vim, and VideoMamba confirm that
DART consistently enhances accuracy while incurring minimal or even reduced
computational overhead. Code is available at

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of ocean is essential for reflecting global climate
dynamics and supporting marine meteorological research. Conventional methods
face challenges due to sparse data, algorithmic complexity, and high
computational costs, while increasing usage of machine learning (ML) method
remains limited to reconstruction problems at the sea surface and local
regions, struggling with issues like cloud occlusion. To address these
limitations, this paper proposes ReconMOST, a data-driven guided diffusion
model framework for multi-layer sea temperature reconstruction. Specifically,
we first pre-train an unconditional diffusion model using a large collection of
historical numerical simulation data, enabling the model to attain physically
consistent distribution patterns of ocean temperature fields. During the
generation phase, sparse yet high-accuracy in-situ observational data are
utilized as guidance points for the reverse diffusion process, generating
accurate reconstruction results. Importantly, in regions lacking direct
observational data, the physically consistent spatial distribution patterns
learned during pre-training enable implicitly guided and physically plausible
reconstructions. Our method extends ML-based SST reconstruction to a global,
multi-layer setting, handling over 92.5% missing data while maintaining
reconstruction accuracy, spatial resolution, and superior generalization
capability. We pre-train our model on CMIP6 numerical simulation data and
conduct guided reconstruction experiments on CMIP6 and EN4 analysis data. The
results of mean squared error (MSE) values achieve 0.049 on guidance, 0.680 on
reconstruction, and 0.633 on total, respectively, demonstrating the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework. Our source code is

Conclusion: Pisces展示了图像理解与生成的协同关系，推动了统一多模态模型的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled multimodal
foundation models to tackle both image understanding and generation within a
unified framework. Despite these gains, unified models often underperform
compared to specialized models in either task. A key challenge in developing
unified models lies in the inherent differences between the visual features
needed for image understanding versus generation, as well as the distinct
training processes required for each modality. In this work, we introduce
Pisces, an auto-regressive multimodal foundation model that addresses this
challenge through a novel decoupled visual encoding architecture and tailored
training techniques optimized for multimodal generation. Combined with
meticulous data curation, pretraining, and finetuning, Pisces achieves
competitive performance in both image understanding and image generation. We
evaluate Pisces on over 20 public benchmarks for image understanding, where it
demonstrates strong performance across a wide range of tasks. Additionally, on
GenEval, a widely adopted benchmark for image generation, Pisces exhibits
robust generative capabilities. Our extensive analysis reveals the synergistic
relationship between image understanding and generation, and the benefits of
using separate visual encoders, advancing the field of unified multimodal

Motivation: 红外小目标检测在复杂背景下因低信噪比、目标形态多样和缺乏视觉线索而具有挑战性，现有深度学习方法因目标内在变异性导致性能不稳定。

Method: 采用压缩-重建-减法（CRS）范式，直接学习图像域中的低秩背景结构，无需显式矩阵分解或基于块的处理。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上，LRRNet在检测精度、鲁棒性和计算效率方面优于38种先进方法，平均速度达82.34 FPS，且在噪声环境下表现稳健。

Conclusion: LRRNet是首个直接通过深度神经网络端到端学习低秩背景结构的方法，显著提升了红外小目标检测的性能和效率。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) remains a long-standing challenge in
complex backgrounds due to low signal-to-clutter ratios (SCR), diverse target
morphologies, and the absence of distinctive visual cues. While recent deep
learning approaches aim to learn discriminative representations, the intrinsic
variability and weak priors of small targets often lead to unstable
performance. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end IRSTD framework,
termed LRRNet, which leverages the low-rank property of infrared image
backgrounds. Inspired by the physical compressibility of cluttered scenes, our
approach adopts a compression--reconstruction--subtraction (CRS) paradigm to
directly model structure-aware low-rank background representations in the image
domain, without relying on patch-based processing or explicit matrix
decomposition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to directly
learn low-rank background structures using deep neural networks in an
end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets
demonstrate that LRRNet outperforms 38 state-of-the-art methods in terms of
detection accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Remarkably, it
achieves real-time performance with an average speed of 82.34 FPS. Evaluations
on the challenging NoisySIRST dataset further confirm the model's resilience to
sensor noise. The source code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

*Shuo wang,Jihao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MF2Summ是一种基于多模态内容理解的视频摘要模型，结合视觉和听觉信息，通过五阶段流程实现高效摘要生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线视频内容的快速增长需要更有效的摘要技术，传统单模态方法难以捕捉视频的完整语义。

Method: 采用GoogLeNet和SoundNet提取特征，结合跨模态Transformer和对齐自注意力Transformer建模模态依赖关系，通过NMS和KTS算法选择关键片段。

Result: 在SumMe和TVSum数据集上表现优异，F1分数分别比DSNet提高1.9%和0.6%。

Conclusion: MF2Summ通过多模态融合显著提升了视频摘要的性能，优于现有方法。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of online video content necessitates effective video
summarization techniques. Traditional methods, often relying on a single
modality (typically visual), struggle to capture the full semantic richness of
videos. This paper introduces MF2Summ, a novel video summarization model based
on multimodal content understanding, integrating both visual and auditory
information. MF2Summ employs a five-stage process: feature extraction,
cross-modal attention interaction, feature fusion, segment prediction, and key
shot selection. Visual features are extracted using a pre-trained GoogLeNet
model, while auditory features are derived using SoundNet. The core of our
fusion mechanism involves a cross-modal Transformer and an alignment-guided
self-attention Transformer, designed to effectively model inter-modal
dependencies and temporal correspondences. Segment importance, location, and
center-ness are predicted, followed by key shot selection using Non-Maximum
Suppression (NMS) and the Kernel Temporal Segmentation (KTS) algorithm.
Experimental results on the SumMe and TVSum datasets demonstrate that MF2Summ
achieves competitive performance, notably improving F1-scores by 1.9\% and
0.6\% respectively over the DSNet model, and performing favorably against other
state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: CIDer框架通过自蒸馏和因果推理模块，解决了多模态情感识别中的模态缺失和OOD数据问题，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态情感识别（MER）面临模态缺失和OOD数据的双重挑战，现有方法实用性有限。

Method: 提出CIDer框架，包含自蒸馏模块（MSSD）和因果推理模块（MACI），并引入RMFM任务。

Result: CIDer在RMFM和OOD场景下表现稳健，参数更少且训练更快。

Conclusion: CIDer为MER提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) face challenges
in addressing both modality missing and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data
simultaneously. Existing methods often rely on specific models or introduce
excessive parameters, which limits their practicality. To address these issues,
we propose a novel robust MER framework, Causal Inference Distiller (CIDer),
and introduce a new task, Random Modality Feature Missing (RMFM), to generalize
the definition of modality missing. CIDer integrates two key components: a
Model-Specific Self-Distillation (MSSD) module and a Model-Agnostic Causal
Inference (MACI) module. MSSD enhances robustness under the RMFM task through a
weight-sharing self-distillation approach applied across low-level features,
attention maps, and high-level representations. Additionally, a Word-level
Self-aligned Attention Module (WSAM) reduces computational complexity, while a
Multimodal Composite Transformer (MCT) facilitates efficient multimodal fusion.
To tackle OOD challenges, MACI employs a tailored causal graph to mitigate
label and language biases using a Multimodal Causal Module (MCM) and
fine-grained counterfactual texts. Notably, MACI can independently enhance OOD
generalization with minimal additional parameters. Furthermore, we also
introduce the new repartitioned MER OOD datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that CIDer achieves robust performance in both RMFM and OOD
scenarios, with fewer parameters and faster training compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The implementation of this work is publicly
accessible at https://github.com/gw-zhong/CIDer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于显式运动的生成式视频编码在人体视频压缩中表现不佳，存在失真和运动不准确的问题，因此需要探索更有效的方法。

Method: 通过将复杂人体信号表征为紧凑的视觉特征，并将其转换为隐式运动指导，用于信号重建。

Result: 实验证明，提出的IMT方法能有效提高GHVC的压缩效率和重建质量。

Conclusion: IMT方法为生成式人体视频编码提供了一种高效且高保真的解决方案。

Abstract: Beyond traditional hybrid-based video codec, generative video codec could
achieve promising compression performance by evolving high-dimensional signals
into compact feature representations for bitstream compactness at the encoder
side and developing explicit motion fields as intermediate supervision for
high-quality reconstruction at the decoder side. This paradigm has achieved
significant success in face video compression. However, compared to facial
videos, human body videos pose greater challenges due to their more complex and
diverse motion patterns, i.e., when using explicit motion guidance for
Generative Human Video Coding (GHVC), the reconstruction results could suffer
severe distortions and inaccurate motion. As such, this paper highlights the
limitations of explicit motion-based approaches for human body video
compression and investigates the GHVC performance improvement with the aid of
Implicit Motion Transformation, namely IMT. In particular, we propose to
characterize complex human body signal into compact visual features and
transform these features into implicit motion guidance for signal
reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed IMT paradigm, which can facilitate GHVC to achieve high-efficiency
compression and high-fidelity synthesis.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种增强高光谱图像分类模型对抗样本可迁移性的新方法，通过随机分块和特征距离损失设计，显著提升了对抗样本的转移效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像（HSI）因其高维和丰富的光谱信息与自然图像不同，现有对抗攻击方法在HSI领域研究有限且未能充分利用图像结构信息。

Method: 方法包括随机分块以增加输入多样性，并设计特征距离损失以扰动真实类别的特征，从而提升对抗样本的可迁移性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法生成的对抗样本在公开HSI数据集上对黑盒模型具有高效可迁移性，并在防御策略下保持强攻击性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了HSI对抗样本可迁移性问题，为相关安全挑战提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which pose
security challenges to hyperspectral image (HSI) classification technologies
based on DNNs. In the domain of natural images, numerous transfer-based
adversarial attack methods have been studied. However, HSIs differ from natural
images due to their high-dimensional and rich spectral information. Current
research on HSI adversarial examples remains limited and faces challenges in
fully utilizing the structural and feature information of images. To address
these issues, this paper proposes a novel method to enhance the transferability
of the adversarial examples for HSI classification models. First, while keeping
the image structure unchanged, the proposed method randomly divides the image
into blocks in both spatial and spectral dimensions. Then, various
transformations are applied on a block by block basis to increase input
diversity and mitigate overfitting. Second, a feature distancing loss targeting
intermediate layers is designed, which measures the distance between the
amplified features of the original examples and the features of the adversarial
examples as the primary loss, while the output layer prediction serves as the
auxiliary loss. This guides the perturbation to disrupt the features of the
true class in adversarial examples, effectively enhancing transferability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the adversarial examples generated by
the proposed method achieve effective transferability to black-box models on
two public HSI datasets. Furthermore, the method maintains robust attack
performance even under defense strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化是降低机器学习模型推理成本的重要工具，但权重初始化对量化鲁棒性的影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过分析不同权重初始化对CNN量化鲁棒性的影响，提出GHN-QAT方法，利用GHN预测量化DNN参数并微调以提升精度。

Result: GHN-QAT显著提升了4位量化的精度，并在2位量化中表现优于随机初始化。

Conclusion: GHN-QAT为量化DNN设计提供了新思路，未来可结合量化感知训练进一步优化。

Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) quantization for fast, efficient inference has been
an important tool in limiting the cost of machine learning (ML) model
inference. Quantization-specific model development techniques such as
regularization, quantization-aware training, and quantization-robustness
penalties have served to greatly boost the accuracy and robustness of modern
DNNs. However, very little exploration has been done on improving the initial
conditions of DNN training for quantization. Just as random weight
initialization has been shown to significantly impact test accuracy of floating
point models, it would make sense that different weight initialization methods
impact quantization robustness of trained models. We present an extensive study
examining the effects of different weight initializations on a variety of CNN
building blocks commonly used in efficient CNNs. This analysis reveals that
even with varying CNN architectures, the choice of random weight initializer
can significantly affect final quantization robustness. Next, we explore a new
method for quantization-robust CNN initialization -- using Graph Hypernetworks
(GHN) to predict parameters of quantized DNNs. Besides showing that
GHN-predicted parameters are quantization-robust after regular float32
pretraining (of the GHN), we find that finetuning GHNs to predict parameters
for quantized graphs (which we call GHN-QAT) can further improve quantized
accuracy of CNNs. Notably, GHN-QAT shows significant accuracy improvements for
even 4-bit quantization and better-than-random accuracy for 2-bits. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study on quantization-aware DNN
weight initialization. GHN-QAT offers a novel approach to quantized DNN model
design. Future investigations, such as using GHN-QAT-initialized parameters for
quantization-aware training, can further streamline the DNN quantization
process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像分割模型依赖显式指令且缺乏主动推理能力，限制了其在自动诊断中的应用。

Method: 提出MedSeg-R框架，包含全局上下文理解模块和像素级定位模块，结合MLLMs生成分割掩码和文本响应。

Result: 实验证明MedSeg-R在多个基准测试中表现优异，实现了高分割精度和可解释的文本分析。

Conclusion: MedSeg-R为医学图像推理分割提供了有效解决方案，推动了自动诊断的发展。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical diagnosis, yet existing
models are limited by their reliance on explicit human instructions and lack
the active reasoning capabilities to understand complex clinical questions.
While recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
improved medical question-answering (QA) tasks, most methods struggle to
generate precise segmentation masks, limiting their application in automatic
medical diagnosis. In this paper, we introduce medical image reasoning
segmentation, a novel task that aims to generate segmentation masks based on
complex and implicit medical instructions. To address this, we propose
MedSeg-R, an end-to-end framework that leverages the reasoning abilities of
MLLMs to interpret clinical questions while also capable of producing
corresponding precise segmentation masks for medical images. It is built on two
core components: 1) a global context understanding module that interprets
images and comprehends complex medical instructions to generate multi-modal
intermediate tokens, and 2) a pixel-level grounding module that decodes these
tokens to produce precise segmentation masks and textual responses.
Furthermore, we introduce MedSeg-QA, a large-scale dataset tailored for the
medical image reasoning segmentation task. It includes over 10,000 image-mask
pairs and multi-turn conversations, automatically annotated using large
language models and refined through physician reviews. Experiments show
MedSeg-R's superior performance across several benchmarks, achieving high
segmentation accuracy and enabling interpretable textual analysis of medical
images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造技术日益复杂，威胁媒体完整性和公众信任，而视觉语言模型（VLM）可能成为检测工具，因此研究其适用性。

Method: 通过精心设计的基准测试，评估ChatGPT、Claude、Gemini和Grok对三类深度伪造（换脸、重演和合成生成）的分类准确性和推理深度。

Result: VLM能生成连贯解释并检测表面异常，但不可靠，易受误导性视觉模式影响，如复古美学。

Conclusion: VLM虽不适合独立检测，但其可解释性和上下文分析能力使其有望成为混合或人机协作检测框架的一部分。

Abstract: The growing sophistication of deepfakes presents substantial challenges to
the integrity of media and the preservation of public trust. Concurrently,
vision-language models (VLMs), large language models enhanced with visual
reasoning capabilities, have emerged as promising tools across various domains,
sparking interest in their applicability to deepfake detection. This study
conducts a structured zero-shot evaluation of four prominent VLMs: ChatGPT,
Claude, Gemini, and Grok, focusing on three primary deepfake types: faceswap,
reenactment, and synthetic generation. Leveraging a meticulously assembled
benchmark comprising authentic and manipulated images from diverse sources, we
evaluate each model's classification accuracy and reasoning depth. Our analysis
indicates that while VLMs can produce coherent explanations and detect
surface-level anomalies, they are not yet dependable as standalone detection
systems. We highlight critical failure modes, such as an overemphasis on
stylistic elements and vulnerability to misleading visual patterns like vintage
aesthetics. Nevertheless, VLMs exhibit strengths in interpretability and
contextual analysis, suggesting their potential to augment human expertise in
forensic workflows. These insights imply that although general-purpose models
currently lack the reliability needed for autonomous deepfake detection, they
hold promise as integral components in hybrid or human-in-the-loop detection
frameworks.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Sheet Music Benchmark (SMB), a dataset of six
hundred and eighty-five pages specifically designed to benchmark Optical Music
Recognition (OMR) research. SMB encompasses a diverse array of musical
textures, including monophony, pianoform, quartet, and others, all encoded in
Common Western Modern Notation using the Humdrum **kern format. Alongside SMB,
we introduce the OMR Normalized Edit Distance (OMR-NED), a new metric tailored
explicitly for evaluating OMR performance. OMR-NED builds upon the widely-used
Symbol Error Rate (SER), offering a fine-grained and detailed error analysis
that covers individual musical elements such as note heads, beams, pitches,
accidentals, and other critical notation features. The resulting numeric score
provided by OMR-NED facilitates clear comparisons, enabling researchers and
end-users alike to identify optimal OMR approaches. Our work thus addresses a
long-standing gap in OMR evaluation, and we support our contributions with
baseline experiments using standardized SMB dataset splits for training and
assessing state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 论文研究了蜂蜜的植物来源区分技术，提出了一种结合持续反向传播（CB）算法的类增量学习（CIL）方法，以解决数据收集不完整的问题，并提高了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蜂蜜的植物来源影响其风味和健康价值，但一次性收集所有品种训练模型不现实，因此需要开发有效的类增量学习技术。

Method: 研究比较了多种CIL算法，并提出结合CB算法的方法，通过重新初始化较少使用的隐藏神经元来增强神经网络的可塑性。

Result: 实验表明，CB方法将大多数CIL算法的性能提高了1-7%。

Conclusion: 结合CB的CIL方法能有效提升蜂蜜植物来源区分的准确性，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Honey is an important commodity in the global market. Honey types of
different botanical origins provide diversified flavors and health benefits,
thus having different market values. Developing accurate and effective
botanical origin-distinguishing techniques is crucial to protect consumers'
interests. However, it is impractical to collect all the varieties of honey
products at once to train a model for botanical origin differentiation.
Therefore, researchers developed class-incremental learning (CIL) techniques to
address this challenge. This study examined and compared multiple CIL
algorithms on a real-world honey hyperspectral imaging dataset. A novel
technique is also proposed to improve the performance of class-incremental
learning algorithms by combining with a continual backpropagation (CB)
algorithm. The CB method addresses the issue of loss-of-plasticity by
reinitializing a proportion of less-used hidden neurons to inject variability
into neural networks. Experiments showed that CB improved the performance of
most CIL methods by 1-7\%.

Result: 在RRSIS-D和RRSIS-M数据集上，PSLG-SAM显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PSLG-SAM通过两阶段分解和训练自由设计，显著减轻标注负担并提升性能。

Abstract: The Reference Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) task generates
segmentation masks for specified objects in images based on textual
descriptions, which has attracted widespread attention and research interest.
Current RRSIS methods rely on multi-modal fusion backbones and semantic
segmentation heads but face challenges like dense annotation requirements and
complex scene interpretation. To address these issues, we propose a framework
named \textit{prompt-generated semantic localization guiding Segment Anything
Model}(PSLG-SAM), which decomposes the RRSIS task into two stages: coarse
localization and fine segmentation. In coarse localization stage, a visual
grounding network roughly locates the text-described object. In fine
segmentation stage, the coordinates from the first stage guide the Segment
Anything Model (SAM), enhanced by a clustering-based foreground point generator
and a mask boundary iterative optimization strategy for precise segmentation.
Notably, the second stage can be train-free, significantly reducing the
annotation data burden for the RRSIS task. Additionally, decomposing the RRSIS
task into two stages allows for focusing on specific region segmentation,
avoiding interference from complex scenes.We further contribute a high-quality,
multi-category manually annotated dataset. Experimental validation on two
datasets (RRSIS-D and RRSIS-M) demonstrates that PSLG-SAM achieves significant
performance improvements and surpasses existing state-of-the-art models.Our
code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and extended operational life of fighter aircraft
necessitates frequent and exhaustive inspections. While surface defect
detection is feasible for human inspectors, manual methods face critical
limitations in scalability, efficiency, and consistency due to the vast surface
area, structural complexity, and operational demands of aircraft maintenance.
We propose a smart surface damage detection and localization system for fighter
aircraft, termed J-DDL. J-DDL integrates 2D images and 3D point clouds of the
entire aircraft surface, captured using a combined system of laser scanners and
cameras, to achieve precise damage detection and localization. Central to our
system is a novel damage detection network built on the YOLO architecture,
specifically optimized for identifying surface defects in 2D aircraft images.
Key innovations include lightweight Fasternet blocks for efficient feature
extraction, an optimized neck architecture incorporating Efficient Multiscale
Attention (EMA) modules for superior feature aggregation, and the introduction
of a novel loss function, Inner-CIOU, to enhance detection accuracy. After
detecting damage in 2D images, the system maps the identified anomalies onto
corresponding 3D point clouds, enabling accurate 3D localization of defects
across the aircraft surface. Our J-DDL not only streamlines the inspection
process but also ensures more comprehensive and detailed coverage of large and
complex aircraft exteriors. To facilitate further advancements in this domain,
we have developed the first publicly available dataset specifically focused on
aircraft damage. Experimental evaluations validate the effectiveness of our
framework, underscoring its potential to significantly advance automated

Abstract: Despite advancements in Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) improving
multimodal understanding, challenges persist in streaming video reasoning due
to its reliance on contextual information. Existing paradigms feed all
available historical contextual information into Vid-LLMs, resulting in a
significant computational burden for visual data processing. Furthermore, the
inclusion of irrelevant context distracts models from key details. This paper
introduces a challenging task called Context-guided Streaming Video Reasoning
(CogStream), which simulates real-world streaming video scenarios, requiring
models to identify the most relevant historical contextual information to
deduce answers for questions about the current stream. To support CogStream, we
present a densely annotated dataset featuring extensive and hierarchical
question-answer pairs, generated by a semi-automatic pipeline. Additionally, we
present CogReasoner as a baseline model. It efficiently tackles this task by
leveraging visual stream compression and historical dialogue retrieval.
Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of this method. Code will be

Motivation: 解决视觉-文本多实例检索任务中特征表示不足的问题，提升语义对齐和检索准确性。

Method: 基于AVION双编码器，引入跨模态注意力流模块，结合对称多相似性损失优化特征。

Result: 在EPIC-KITCHENS-100数据集上达到66.78mAP和82.08nDCG，显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: CR-CLIP通过动态交互和特征优化，有效提升了跨模态检索性能，代码将开源。

Abstract: This report presents ContextRefine-CLIP (CR-CLIP), an efficient model for
visual-textual multi-instance retrieval tasks. The approach is based on the
dual-encoder AVION, on which we introduce a cross-modal attention flow module
to achieve bidirectional dynamic interaction and refinement between visual and
textual features to generate more context-aware joint representations. For
soft-label relevance matrices provided in tasks such as EPIC-KITCHENS-100,
CR-CLIP can work with Symmetric Multi-Similarity Loss to achieve more accurate
semantic alignment and optimization using the refined features. Without using
ensemble learning, the CR-CLIP model achieves 66.78mAP and 82.08nDCG on the
EPIC-KITCHENS-100 public leaderboard, which significantly outperforms the
baseline model and fully validates its effectiveness in cross-modal retrieval.

Abstract: Explaining why the species lives at a particular location is important for
understanding ecological systems and conserving biodiversity. However, existing
ecological workflows are fragmented and often inaccessible to non-specialists.
We propose an end-to-end visual-to-causal framework that transforms a species
image into interpretable causal insights about its habitat preference. The
system integrates species recognition, global occurrence retrieval,
pseudo-absence sampling, and climate data extraction. We then discover causal
structures among environmental features and estimate their influence on species
occurrence using modern causal inference methods. Finally, we generate
statistically grounded, human-readable causal explanations from structured
templates and large language models. We demonstrate the framework on a bee and
a flower species and report early results as part of an ongoing project,
showing the potential of the multimodal AI assistant backed up by a recommended
ecological modeling practice for describing species habitat in
human-understandable language.

Motivation: 现有指标难以检测高性能人脸识别系统中的细微人口统计偏差，尤其是在分数分布尾部。

Method: 引入CEI指标，分别分析真实和冒名顶替分数分布，可配置关注尾部概率，同时考虑整体分布形状。还提出了自动化版本CEI^A。

Result: 实验表明，CEI在检测细微偏差方面优于现有方法，且CEI^A增强了客观性和实用性。

Conclusion: CEI为评估人脸识别系统的公平性提供了强大且敏感的工具，适用于任何关注分布尾部比较的问题。

Abstract: Demographic bias in high-performance face recognition (FR) systems often
eludes detection by existing metrics, especially with respect to subtle
disparities in the tails of the score distribution. We introduce the
Comprehensive Equity Index (CEI), a novel metric designed to address this
limitation. CEI uniquely analyzes genuine and impostor score distributions
separately, enabling a configurable focus on tail probabilities while also
considering overall distribution shapes. Our extensive experiments (evaluating
state-of-the-art FR systems, intentionally biased models, and diverse datasets)
confirm CEI's superior ability to detect nuanced biases where previous methods
fall short. Furthermore, we present CEI^A, an automated version of the metric
that enhances objectivity and simplifies practical application. CEI provides a
robust and sensitive tool for operational FR fairness assessment. The proposed
methods have been developed particularly for bias evaluation in face biometrics
but, in general, they are applicable for comparing statistical distributions in
any problem where one is interested in analyzing the distribution tails.

Dense visual SLAM, leveraging RGB-D camera systems, offers advantages but faces
challenges in achieving real-time performance, robustness, and scalability for
large-scale scenes. Recent approaches utilizing neural implicit scene
representations show promise but suffer from high computational costs and

decompositions, achieves better convergence rates, memory efficiency, and
reconstruction/localization quality than existing state-of-the-art approaches.
Evaluation across diverse indoor RGB-D datasets demonstrates LRSLAM's superior
performance in terms of parameter efficiency, processing time, and accuracy,
retaining reconstruction and localization quality. Our code will be publicly

Abstract: In e-commerce and digital marketing, generating high-fidelity human-product
demonstration videos is important for effective product presentation. However,
most existing frameworks either fail to preserve the identities of both humans
and products or lack an understanding of human-product spatial relationships,
leading to unrealistic representations and unnatural interactions. To address
these challenges, we propose a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework. Our
method simultaneously preserves human identities and product-specific details,
such as logos and textures, by injecting paired human-product reference
information and utilizing an additional masked cross-attention mechanism. We
employ a 3D body mesh template and product bounding boxes to provide precise
motion guidance, enabling intuitive alignment of hand gestures with product
placements. Additionally, structured text encoding is used to incorporate
category-level semantics, enhancing 3D consistency during small rotational
changes across frames. Trained on a hybrid dataset with extensive data
augmentation strategies, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques
in maintaining the identity integrity of both humans and products and
generating realistic demonstration motions. Project page:

Method: 提出病理级跨模态对齐（PCMA）和视觉病理观察提取器，设计代理任务增强细粒度细节。

Result: 在分类、图像到文本检索、语义分割、目标检测和报告生成等任务中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: PLACE框架有效提升医学视觉表示学习，具有通用性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations from image-report pairs through joint
learning has garnered increasing research attention due to its potential to
alleviate the data scarcity problem in the medical domain. The primary
challenges stem from the lengthy reports that feature complex discourse
relations and semantic pathologies. Previous works have predominantly focused
on instance-wise or token-wise cross-modal alignment, often neglecting the
importance of pathological-level consistency. This paper presents a novel
framework PLACE that promotes the Pathological-Level Alignment and enriches the
fine-grained details via Correlation Exploration without additional human
annotations. Specifically, we propose a novel pathological-level cross-modal
alignment (PCMA) approach to maximize the consistency of pathology observations
from both images and reports. To facilitate this, a Visual Pathology
Observation Extractor is introduced to extract visual pathological observation
representations from localized tokens. The PCMA module operates independently
of any external disease annotations, enhancing the generalizability and
robustness of our methods. Furthermore, we design a proxy task that enforces
the model to identify correlations among image patches, thereby enriching the
fine-grained details crucial for various downstream tasks. Experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on multiple downstream tasks, including classification,
image-to-text retrieval, semantic segmentation, object detection and report
generation.

Motivation: 解决CLIP模型中文本与图像模态差异问题，提升仅用文本进行参数高效微调时的图像识别性能。

Method: 利用文本生成图像模型生成多样化图像，结合类热图和可学习原型增强局部特征表示，并融合提示调优和适配器学习。

Result: 在多个基准测试中平均性能提升3.47%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: T2I-PAL无需全语义标注图像，减少人工标注，且兼容现有CLIP框架。

Abstract: Benefited from image-text contrastive learning, pre-trained vision-language
models, e.g., CLIP, allow to direct leverage texts as images (TaI) for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). While CLIP is capable of making image
features to be similar to the corresponding text features, the modality gap
remains a nontrivial issue and limits image recognition performance of TaI.
Using multi-label image recognition (MLR) as an example, we present a novel
method, called T2I-PAL to tackle the modality gap issue when using only text
captions for PEFT. The core design of T2I-PAL is to leverage pre-trained
text-to-image generation models to generate photo-realistic and diverse images
from text captions, thereby reducing the modality gap. To further enhance MLR,
T2I-PAL incorporates a class-wise heatmap and learnable prototypes. This
aggregates local similarities, making the representation of local visual
features more robust and informative for multi-label recognition. For better
PEFT, we further combine both prompt tuning and adapter learning to enhance
classification performance. T2I-PAL offers significant advantages: it
eliminates the need for fully semantically annotated training images, thereby
reducing the manual annotation workload, and it preserves the intrinsic mode of
the CLIP model, allowing for seamless integration with any existing CLIP
framework. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, including MS-COCO,
VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE, show that our T2I-PAL can boost recognition performance
by 3.47% in average above the top-ranked state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: HyperSphereDiff通过结合角度不确定性，更好地保留了超球面流形的内在几何结构，提升了生成模型的性能。

Abstract: Do contemporary diffusion models preserve the class geometry of
hyperspherical data? Standard diffusion models rely on isotropic Gaussian noise
in the forward process, inherently favoring Euclidean spaces. However, many
real-world problems involve non-Euclidean distributions, such as hyperspherical
manifolds, where class-specific patterns are governed by angular geometry
within hypercones. When modeled in Euclidean space, these angular subtleties
are lost, leading to suboptimal generative performance. To address this
limitation, we introduce HyperSphereDiff to align hyperspherical structures
with directional noise, preserving class geometry and effectively capturing
angular uncertainty. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that
this approach aligns the generative process with the intrinsic geometry of
hyperspherical data, resulting in more accurate and geometry-aware generative
models. We evaluate our framework on four object datasets and two face
datasets, showing that incorporating angular uncertainty better preserves the
underlying hyperspherical manifold. Resources are available at:

Result: 实验表明，这种非对称掩码策略能生成更鲁棒和细粒度的注意力图，提升下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 非对称随机掩码策略在自蒸馏框架中有效，能平衡训练效率和语义信息保留。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a
wide range of vision tasks. In particular, self-distillation frameworks such as
DINO have contributed significantly to these advances. Within such frameworks,
random masking is often utilized to improve training efficiency and introduce
regularization. However, recent studies have raised concerns that
indiscriminate random masking may inadvertently eliminate critical semantic
information, motivating the development of more informed masking strategies. In
this study, we explore the role of random masking in the self-distillation
setting, focusing on the DINO framework. Specifically, we apply random masking
exclusively to the student's global view, while preserving the student's local
views and the teacher's global view in their original, unmasked forms. This
design leverages DINO's multi-view augmentation scheme to retain clean
supervision while inducing robustness through masked inputs. We evaluate our
approach using DINO-Tiny on the mini-ImageNet dataset and show that random
masking under this asymmetric setup yields more robust and fine-grained
attention maps, ultimately enhancing downstream performance.

Conclusion: HEA-MM框架能够全面评估飞机CAD模型的误差，确保制造质量。

Abstract: The most essential feature of aviation equipment is high quality, including
high performance, high stability and high reliability. In this paper, we
propose a novel hierarchical error assessment framework for aircraft CAD models
within a manufacturing-and-measurement platform, termed HEA-MM. HEA-MM employs
structured light scanners to obtain comprehensive 3D measurements of
manufactured workpieces. The measured point cloud is registered with the
reference CAD model, followed by an error analysis conducted at three
hierarchical levels: global, part, and feature. At the global level, the error
analysis evaluates the overall deviation of the scanned point cloud from the
reference CAD model. At the part level, error analysis is performed on these
patches underlying the point clouds. We propose a novel optimization-based
primitive refinement method to obtain a set of meaningful patches of point
clouds. Two basic operations, splitting and merging, are introduced to refine
the coarse primitives. At the feature level, error analysis is performed on
circular holes, which are commonly found in CAD models. To facilitate it, a
two-stage algorithm is introduced for the detection of circular holes. First,
edge points are identified using a tensor-voting algorithm. Then, multiple
circles are fitted through a hypothesize-and-clusterize framework, ensuring
accurate detection and analysis of the circular features. Experimental results
on various aircraft CAD models demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
method.

Conclusion: SSP为密集场景中的点监督目标检测提供了高效解决方案，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Recent remote sensing tech advancements drive imagery growth, making oriented
object detection rapid development, yet hindered by labor-intensive annotation
for high-density scenes. Oriented object detection with point supervision
offers a cost-effective solution for densely packed scenes in remote sensing,
yet existing methods suffer from inadequate sample assignment and instance
confusion due to rigid rule-based designs. To address this, we propose SSP
(Semantic-decoupled Spatial Partition), a unified framework that synergizes
rule-driven prior injection and data-driven label purification. Specifically,
SSP introduces two core innovations: 1) Pixel-level Spatial Partition-based
Sample Assignment, which compactly estimates the upper and lower bounds of
object scales and mines high-quality positive samples and hard negative samples
through spatial partitioning of pixel maps. 2) Semantic Spatial Partition-based
Box Extraction, which derives instances from spatial partitions modulated by
semantic maps and reliably converts them into bounding boxes to form
pseudo-labels for supervising the learning of downstream detectors. Experiments
on DOTA-v1.0 and others demonstrate SSP\' s superiority: it achieves 45.78% mAP
under point supervision, outperforming SOTA method PointOBB-v2 by 4.10%.
Furthermore, when integrated with ORCNN and ReDet architectures, the SSP
framework achieves mAP values of 47.86% and 48.50%, respectively. The code is

Conclusion: LatentCSI提供了一种高效、高质量且可控的图像生成方法，适用于WiFi CSI到图像的转换。

Abstract: We present LatentCSI, a novel method for generating images of the physical
environment from WiFi CSI measurements that leverages a pretrained latent
diffusion model (LDM). Unlike prior approaches that rely on complex and
computationally intensive techniques such as GANs, our method employs a
lightweight neural network to map CSI amplitudes directly into the latent space
of an LDM. We then apply the LDM's denoising diffusion model to the latent
representation with text-based guidance before decoding using the LDM's
pretrained decoder to obtain a high-resolution image. This design bypasses the
challenges of pixel-space image generation and avoids the explicit image
encoding stage typically required in conventional image-to-image pipelines,
enabling efficient and high-quality image synthesis. We validate our approach
on two datasets: a wide-band CSI dataset we collected with off-the-shelf WiFi
devices and cameras; and a subset of the publicly available MM-Fi dataset. The
results demonstrate that LatentCSI outperforms baselines of comparable
complexity trained directly on ground-truth images in both computational
efficiency and perceptual quality, while additionally providing practical
advantages through its unique capacity for text-guided controllability.

Conclusion: MSTAR高效且成本低，为场景文本检索提供了新方向。

Abstract: Scene text retrieval has made significant progress with the assistance of
accurate text localization. However, existing approaches typically require
costly bounding box annotations for training. Besides, they mostly adopt a
customized retrieval strategy but struggle to unify various types of queries to
meet diverse retrieval needs. To address these issues, we introduce Muti-query
Scene Text retrieval with Attention Recycling (MSTAR), a box-free approach for
scene text retrieval. It incorporates progressive vision embedding to
dynamically capture the multi-grained representation of texts and harmonizes
free-style text queries with style-aware instructions. Additionally, a
multi-instance matching module is integrated to enhance vision-language
alignment. Furthermore, we build the Multi-Query Text Retrieval (MQTR) dataset,
the first benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-query scene text retrieval
capability of models, comprising four query types and 16k images. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method across seven public
datasets and the MQTR dataset. Notably, MSTAR marginally surpasses the previous
state-of-the-art model by 6.4% in MAP on Total-Text while eliminating box
annotation costs. Moreover, on the MQTR benchmark, MSTAR significantly
outperforms the previous models by an average of 8.5%. The code and datasets

Conclusion: TexTailor通过改进纹理合成过程，显著提升了纹理一致性，为文本到纹理合成提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: We present TexTailor, a novel method for generating consistent object
textures from textual descriptions. Existing text-to-texture synthesis
approaches utilize depth-aware diffusion models to progressively generate
images and synthesize textures across predefined multiple viewpoints. However,
these approaches lead to a gradual shift in texture properties across
viewpoints due to (1) insufficient integration of previously synthesized
textures at each viewpoint during the diffusion process and (2) the
autoregressive nature of the texture synthesis process. Moreover, the
predefined selection of camera positions, which does not account for the
object's geometry, limits the effective use of texture information synthesized
from different viewpoints, ultimately degrading overall texture consistency. In
TexTailor, we address these issues by (1) applying a resampling scheme that
repeatedly integrates information from previously synthesized textures within
the diffusion process, and (2) fine-tuning a depth-aware diffusion model on
these resampled textures. During this process, we observed that using only a
few training images restricts the model's original ability to generate
high-fidelity images aligned with the conditioning, and therefore propose an
performance preservation loss to mitigate this issue. Additionally, we improve
the synthesis of view-consistent textures by adaptively adjusting camera
positions based on the object's geometry. Experiments on a subset of the
Objaverse dataset and the ShapeNet car dataset demonstrate that TexTailor
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in synthesizing view-consistent textures.

synthesis in recent years. In the domain of natural (RGB) images, recent works
have shown that such models can be adapted to various vision-language
downstream tasks with little to no supervision involved. On the contrary,
text-to-image Latent Diffusion Models remain relatively underexplored in the
field of medical imaging, primarily due to limited data availability (e.g., due
to privacy concerns). In this work, focusing on the chest X-ray modality, we
first demonstrate that a standard text-conditioned Latent Diffusion Model has
not learned to align clinically relevant information in free-text radiology
reports with the corresponding areas of the given scan. Then, to alleviate this
issue, we propose a fine-tuning framework to improve multi-modal alignment in a
pre-trained model such that it can be efficiently repurposed for downstream
tasks such as phrase grounding. Our method sets a new state-of-the-art on a
standard benchmark dataset (MS-CXR), while also exhibiting robust performance
on out-of-distribution data (VinDr-CXR). Our code will be made publicly
available.

TL;DR: SymmFlow是一种对称流匹配框架，统一了语义分割、分类和图像生成任务，通过双向一致性学习和保留语义信息，实现了高效采样和多样化生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的流匹配方法通常专注于单一任务，缺乏统一框架。SymmFlow旨在通过对称学习目标，同时支持多种任务并保持语义一致性。

Method: 提出对称学习目标，联合建模正向和反向变换，保留语义信息，并引入新训练目标以实现一步分割和分类。

Result: 在CelebAMask-HQ和COCO-Stuff上分别取得FID 11.9和7.0的优异生成性能，同时在分割和分类任务中表现竞争力。

Conclusion: SymmFlow为多任务学习提供了高效统一的框架，展示了在生成、分割和分类任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Flow Matching has emerged as a powerful framework for learning continuous
transformations between distributions, enabling high-fidelity generative
modeling. This work introduces Symmetrical Flow Matching (SymmFlow), a new
formulation that unifies semantic segmentation, classification, and image
generation within a single model. Using a symmetric learning objective,
SymmFlow models forward and reverse transformations jointly, ensuring
bi-directional consistency, while preserving sufficient entropy for generative
diversity. A new training objective is introduced to explicitly retain semantic
information across flows, featuring efficient sampling while preserving
semantic structure, allowing for one-step segmentation and classification
without iterative refinement. Unlike previous approaches that impose strict
one-to-one mapping between masks and images, SymmFlow generalizes to flexible
conditioning, supporting both pixel-level and image-level class labels.
Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that SymmFlow achieves
state-of-the-art performance on semantic image synthesis, obtaining FID scores
of 11.9 on CelebAMask-HQ and 7.0 on COCO-Stuff with only 25 inference steps.
Additionally, it delivers competitive results on semantic segmentation and
shows promising capabilities in classification tasks. The code will be publicly
available.

Motivation: 现有视频生成模型的微调方法依赖人工标注和大量计算资源，限制了实用性。

Method: 设计了基于提示的数据引擎和奖励引导的训练策略，利用预训练视觉语言模型的反馈优化微调。

Result: 在VBench-2.0基准测试中，GigaVideo-1在17个维度上平均提升4%，仅需4 GPU小时。

Conclusion: GigaVideo-1无需人工标注和大量数据，高效且有效。

Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion models has greatly enhanced video generation
quality, yet these models still require fine-tuning to improve specific
dimensions like instance preservation, motion rationality, composition, and
physical plausibility. Existing fine-tuning approaches often rely on human
annotations and large-scale computational resources, limiting their
practicality. In this work, we propose GigaVideo-1, an efficient fine-tuning
framework that advances video generation without additional human supervision.
Rather than injecting large volumes of high-quality data from external sources,
GigaVideo-1 unlocks the latent potential of pre-trained video diffusion models
through automatic feedback. Specifically, we focus on two key aspects of the
fine-tuning process: data and optimization. To improve fine-tuning data, we
design a prompt-driven data engine that constructs diverse, weakness-oriented
training samples. On the optimization side, we introduce a reward-guided
training strategy, which adaptively weights samples using feedback from
pre-trained vision-language models with a realism constraint. We evaluate
GigaVideo-1 on the VBench-2.0 benchmark using Wan2.1 as the baseline across 17
evaluation dimensions. Experiments show that GigaVideo-1 consistently improves
performance on almost all the dimensions with an average gain of about 4% using
only 4 GPU-hours. Requiring no manual annotations and minimal real data,
GigaVideo-1 demonstrates both effectiveness and efficiency. Code, model, and
data will be publicly available.

TL;DR: PiPViT是一种基于视觉Transformer的原型模型，通过长距离依赖学习和对比学习，生成可解释的医学图像原型，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有原型方法在医学图像中可视化不一致和粒度过于精细的问题，提升原型在临床中的可解释性。

Method: 利用ViT捕捉图像块间的长距离依赖，结合对比学习和多分辨率输入处理，生成可解释的原型。

Result: 在视网膜OCT图像分类任务中表现优异，原型具有临床相关性，能提供更直观的解释。

Conclusion: PiPViT能透明解释决策过程，辅助临床诊断，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Background and Objective: Prototype-based methods improve interpretability by
learning fine-grained part-prototypes; however, their visualization in the
input pixel space is not always consistent with human-understandable
biomarkers. In addition, well-known prototype-based approaches typically learn
extremely granular prototypes that are less interpretable in medical imaging,
where both the presence and extent of biomarkers and lesions are critical.
  Methods: To address these challenges, we propose PiPViT (Patch-based Visual
Interpretable Prototypes), an inherently interpretable prototypical model for
image recognition. Leveraging a vision transformer (ViT), PiPViT captures
long-range dependencies among patches to learn robust, human-interpretable
prototypes that approximate lesion extent only using image-level labels.
Additionally, PiPViT benefits from contrastive learning and multi-resolution
input processing, which enables effective localization of biomarkers across
scales.
  Results: We evaluated PiPViT on retinal OCT image classification across four
datasets, where it achieved competitive quantitative performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods while delivering more meaningful explanations.
Moreover, quantitative evaluation on a hold-out test set confirms that the
learned prototypes are semantically and clinically relevant. We believe PiPViT
can transparently explain its decisions and assist clinicians in understanding
diagnostic outcomes. Github page: https://github.com/marziehoghbaie/PiPViT

Motivation: 深度伪造技术威胁信息真实性，现有检测模型资源消耗大，需轻量化解决方案。

Conclusion: 该模型为深度伪造检测提供了高效、低资源消耗的解决方案。

Abstract: In the digital age, Deepfake present a formidable challenge by using advanced
artificial intelligence to create highly convincing manipulated content,
undermining information authenticity and security. These sophisticated
fabrications surpass traditional detection methods in complexity and realism.
To address this issue, we aim to harness cutting-edge deep learning
methodologies to engineer an innovative deepfake detection model. However, most
of the models designed for deepfake detection are large, causing heavy storage
and memory consumption. In this research, we propose a lightweight convolution
neural network (CNN) with squeeze and excitation block attention (SE) for
Deepfake detection. The SE block module is designed to perform dynamic
channel-wise feature recalibration. The SE block allows the network to
emphasize informative features and suppress less useful ones, which leads to a
more efficient and effective learning module. This module is integrated with a
simple sequential model to perform Deepfake detection. The model is smaller in
size and it achieves competing accuracy with the existing models for deepfake
detection tasks. The model achieved an overall classification accuracy of
94.14% and AUC-ROC score of 0.985 on the Style GAN dataset from the Diverse
Fake Face Dataset. Our proposed approach presents a promising avenue for
combating the Deepfake challenge with minimal computational resources,
developing efficient and scalable solutions for digital content verification.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CAPTCHA方案因深度学习发展而易受自动化攻击，现有对抗攻击方法依赖原始图像特征，导致失真且适用性受限。

Method: 提出UAC框架，利用LLM生成高保真对抗样本；目标攻击采用EDICT方法优化扩散模型；非目标攻击引入BP-UAC，结合多模态梯度和双路径优化。

Result: BP-UAC在多种系统中攻击成功率高，生成的CAPTCHA自然且难以区分。

Conclusion: UAC框架有效提升CAPTCHA对抗攻击能力，适用于多样场景。

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in deep learning, traditional CAPTCHA schemes are
increasingly vulnerable to automated attacks powered by deep neural networks
(DNNs). Existing adversarial attack methods often rely on original image
characteristics, resulting in distortions that hinder human interpretation and
limit applicability in scenarios lacking initial input images. To address these
challenges, we propose the Unsourced Adversarial CAPTCHA (UAC), a novel
framework generating high-fidelity adversarial examples guided by
attacker-specified text prompts. Leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM), UAC
enhances CAPTCHA diversity and supports both targeted and untargeted attacks.
For targeted attacks, the EDICT method optimizes dual latent variables in a
diffusion model for superior image quality. In untargeted attacks, especially
for black-box scenarios, we introduce bi-path unsourced adversarial CAPTCHA
(BP-UAC), a two-step optimization strategy employing multimodal gradients and
bi-path optimization for efficient misclassification. Experiments show BP-UAC
achieves high attack success rates across diverse systems, generating natural
CAPTCHAs indistinguishable to humans and DNNs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多任务架构，结合年龄回归和多个年龄阈值分类任务，通过改进损失函数和采样策略，显著提升了未成年人检测的准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决未成年人数据不足和分布偏移问题，提升自动筛查模型的鲁棒性。

Method: 基于冻结的FaRL视觉语言主干网络，结合多层感知机，引入α加权焦点损失和年龄平衡采样策略。

Result: 在ASORES-39k和ASWIFT-20k测试集上，模型显著降低了年龄估计误差并提升了未成年人检测的F2分数。

Conclusion: 多任务架构和改进的训练策略有效提升了模型在分布偏移下的泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate automatic screening of minors in unconstrained images demands models
that are robust to distribution shift and resilient to the children
under-representation in publicly available data. To overcome these issues, we
propose a multi-task architecture with dedicated under/over-age discrimination
tasks based on a frozen FaRL vision-language backbone joined with a compact
two-layer MLP that shares features across one age-regression head and four
binary under-age heads for age thresholds of 12, 15, 18, and 21 years, focusing
on the legally critical age range. To address the severe class imbalance, we
introduce an $\alpha$-reweighted focal-style loss and age-balanced mini-batch
sampling, which equalizes twelve age bins during stochastic optimization.
Further improvement is achieved with an age gap that removes edge cases from
the loss.
  Moreover, we set a rigorous evaluation by proposing the Overall Under-Age
Benchmark, with 303k cleaned training images and 110k test images, defining
both the "ASORES-39k" restricted overall test, which removes the noisiest
domains, and the age estimation wild shifts test "ASWIFT-20k" of 20k-images,
stressing extreme pose ($>$45{\deg}), expression, and low image quality to
emulate real-world shifts.
  Trained on the cleaned overall set with resampling and age gap, our multiage
model "F" lowers the root-mean-square-error on the ASORES-39k restricted test
from 5.733 (age-only baseline) to 5.656 years and lifts under-18 detection from
F2 score of 0.801 to 0.857 at 1% false-adult rate. Under the domain shift to
the wild data of ASWIFT-20k, the same configuration nearly sustains 0.99 recall
while boosting F2 from 0.742 to 0.833 with respect to the age-only baseline,
demonstrating strong generalization under distribution shift. For the under-12
and under-15 tasks, the respective boosts in F2 are from 0.666 to 0.955 and
from 0.689 to 0.916, respectively.

Motivation: 现实应用（如机器人和自动驾驶汽车）需要模型同时处理实例和类别，而传统持续学习仅关注单一层面。

Method: 提出HyperCLIC算法，利用双曲空间建模层次关系，结合双曲分类和蒸馏目标。

Result: 在EgoObjects数据集上验证，HyperCLIC在多粒度任务中表现优异，提升了层次泛化能力。

Conclusion: HyperCLIC通过双曲空间有效解决了实例和类别的持续学习问题，适用于复杂现实场景。

Abstract: Continual learning has traditionally focused on classifying either instances
or classes, but real-world applications, such as robotics and self-driving
cars, require models to handle both simultaneously. To mirror real-life
scenarios, we introduce the task of continual learning of instances and
classes, at the same time. This task challenges models to adapt to multiple
levels of granularity over time, which requires balancing fine-grained instance
recognition with coarse-grained class generalization. In this paper, we
identify that classes and instances naturally form a hierarchical structure. To
model these hierarchical relationships, we propose HyperCLIC, a continual
learning algorithm that leverages hyperbolic space, which is uniquely suited
for hierarchical data due to its ability to represent tree-like structures with
low distortion and compact embeddings. Our framework incorporates hyperbolic
classification and distillation objectives, enabling the continual embedding of
hierarchical relations. To evaluate performance across multiple granularities,
we introduce continual hierarchical metrics. We validate our approach on
EgoObjects, the only dataset that captures the complexity of hierarchical
object recognition in dynamic real-world environments. Empirical results show
that HyperCLIC operates effectively at multiple granularities with improved
hierarchical generalization.

Conclusion: UMBD框架能够有效提升COD性能，且兼容现有编码器-解码器模型，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) presents inherent challenges due to the
subtle visual differences between targets and their backgrounds. While existing
methods have made notable progress, there remains significant potential for
post-processing refinement that has yet to be fully explored. To address this
limitation, we propose the Uncertainty-Masked Bernoulli Diffusion (UMBD) model,
the first generative refinement framework specifically designed for COD. UMBD
introduces an uncertainty-guided masking mechanism that selectively applies
Bernoulli diffusion to residual regions with poor segmentation quality,
enabling targeted refinement while preserving correctly segmented areas. To
support this process, we design the Hybrid Uncertainty Quantification Network
(HUQNet), which employs a multi-branch architecture and fuses uncertainty from
multiple sources to improve estimation accuracy. This enables adaptive guidance
during the generative sampling process. The proposed UMBD framework can be
seamlessly integrated with a wide range of existing Encoder-Decoder-based COD
models, combining their discriminative capabilities with the generative
advantages of diffusion-based refinement. Extensive experiments across multiple
COD benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance improvements, achieving
average gains of 5.5% in MAE and 3.2% in weighted F-measure with only modest
computational overhead. Code will be released.

Result: 深度学习方法优于基线方法，能够从CAD计划生成模拟黄金标准，提升缺陷检测效率。

Conclusion: 该方法在表面缺陷检测中具有实际应用价值，可通过模板匹配提升效率。

Abstract: Quality management in semiconductor manufacturing often relies on template
matching with known golden standards. For Indium-Phosphide (InP) multi-project
wafer manufacturing, low production scale and high design variability lead to
such golden standards being typically unavailable. Defect detection, in turn,
is manual and labor-intensive. This work addresses this challenge by proposing
a methodology to generate a synthetic golden standard using Deep Neural
Networks, trained to simulate photo-realistic InP wafer images from CAD data.
We evaluate various training objectives and assess the quality of the simulated
images on both synthetic data and InP wafer photographs. Our
deep-learning-based method outperforms a baseline decision-tree-based approach,
enabling the use of a 'simulated golden die' from CAD plans in any user-defined
region of a wafer for more efficient defect detection. We apply our method to a
template matching procedure, to demonstrate its practical utility in surface
defect detection.

Result: 在六个医学数据集上实现SOTA性能。

Conclusion: IQE-CLIP有效解决了医学领域异常检测的挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models, such as CLIP, have significantly
improved performance in zero- and few-shot anomaly detection (ZFSAD) tasks.
However, most existing CLIP-based methods assume prior knowledge of categories
and rely on carefully designed prompts tailored to specific scenarios. While
these text prompts capture semantic information in the textual space, they
often fail to distinguish normal and anomalous instances in the joint embedding
space. Moreover, most ZFSAD approaches focus on industrial domains, with
limited exploration in medical tasks. To address these limitations, we propose
IQE-CLIP, a novel framework for ZFSAD in the medical domain. We show that query
embeddings integrating both textual and instance-aware visual information serve
as more effective indicators of anomalies. Specifically, we introduce
class-based and learnable prompting tokens to better adapt CLIP to the medical
setting. Furthermore, we design an instance-aware query module that extracts
region-level contextual information from both modalities, enabling the
generation of anomaly-sensitive embeddings. Extensive experiments on six
medical datasets demonstrate that IQE-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Code and data are

Abstract: Generating aesthetic posters is more challenging than simple design images:
it requires not only precise text rendering but also the seamless integration
of abstract artistic content, striking layouts, and overall stylistic harmony.
To address this, we propose PosterCraft, a unified framework that abandons
prior modular pipelines and rigid, predefined layouts, allowing the model to
freely explore coherent, visually compelling compositions. PosterCraft employs
a carefully designed, cascaded workflow to optimize the generation of
high-aesthetic posters: (i) large-scale text-rendering optimization on our
newly introduced Text-Render-2M dataset; (ii) region-aware supervised
fine-tuning on HQ-Poster100K; (iii) aesthetic-text-reinforcement learning via
best-of-n preference optimization; and (iv) joint vision-language feedback
refinement. Each stage is supported by a fully automated data-construction
pipeline tailored to its specific needs, enabling robust training without
complex architectural modifications. Evaluated on multiple experiments,
PosterCraft significantly outperforms open-source baselines in rendering
accuracy, layout coherence, and overall visual appeal-approaching the quality
of SOTA commercial systems. Our code, models, and datasets can be found in the

Conclusion: SbCA有效解决了分布漂移问题，消除了伪影、噪声和模糊，实现了高质量的超分辨率重建。

Abstract: Prior Arbitrary-Scale Image Super-Resolution (ASISR) methods often experience
a significant performance decline when the upsampling factor exceeds the range
covered by the training data, introducing substantial blurring. To address this
issue, we propose a unified model, Stroke-based Cyclic Amplifier (SbCA), for
ultra-large upsampling tasks. The key of SbCA is the stroke vector amplifier,
which decomposes the image into a series of strokes represented as vector
graphics for magnification. Then, the detail completion module also restores
missing details, ensuring high-fidelity image reconstruction. Our cyclic
strategy achieves ultra-large upsampling by iteratively refining details with
this unified SbCA model, trained only once for all, while keeping sub-scales
within the training range. Our approach effectively addresses the distribution
drift issue and eliminates artifacts, noise and blurring, producing
high-quality, high-resolution super-resolved images. Experimental validations
on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods in ultra-large upsampling tasks
(e.g. $\times100$), delivering visual quality far superior to state-of-the-art
techniques.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about dynamics governed by physical laws through
visual observation, akin to human capabilities in the real world, poses
significant challenges. Currently, object-centric dynamic simulation methods,
which emulate human behavior, have achieved notable progress but overlook two
critical aspects: 1) the integration of physical knowledge into models. Humans
gain physical insights by observing the world and apply this knowledge to
accurately reason about various dynamic scenarios; 2) the validation of model
adaptability across diverse scenarios. Real-world dynamics, especially those
involving fluids and objects, demand models that not only capture object
interactions but also simulate fluid flow characteristics. To address these
gaps, we introduce SlotPi, a slot-based physics-informed object-centric
reasoning model. SlotPi integrates a physical module based on Hamiltonian
principles with a spatio-temporal prediction module for dynamic forecasting.
Our experiments highlight the model's strengths in tasks such as prediction and
Visual Question Answering (VQA) on benchmark and fluid datasets. Furthermore,
we have created a real-world dataset encompassing object interactions, fluid
dynamics, and fluid-object interactions, on which we validated our model's
capabilities. The model's robust performance across all datasets underscores
its strong adaptability, laying a foundation for developing more advanced world
models.

blur and latency, this approach leverages the asynchronous nature of event
cameras to process visual information over flexible time intervals, enabling
adaptive inference and control. The framework integrates event-based
perception, additional range sensing, and policy optimization via Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient, with an initial imitation learning phase to
improve sample efficiency. Promising results are achieved in simulated
environments, demonstrating robust navigation, pedestrian following, and

*Mario Barbara,Alaa Maalouf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练数据的零样本视频摘要方法，通过结合视频语言模型和大语言模型，实现用户可控的摘要生成，性能优于现有无监督方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视频摘要方法依赖领域特定数据或无法结合用户自然语言意图的问题。

Method: 1. 视频分段；2. 生成场景描述；3. 利用LLM评分；4. 通过一致性和独特性指标传播分数。

Result: 在SumMe和TVSum上超越无监督方法，在QFVS基准上表现竞争力。

Conclusion: 预训练多模态模型结合提示和分数传播，为通用文本查询视频摘要提供了强大基础。

Abstract: The explosive growth of video data intensified the need for flexible
user-controllable summarization tools that can operate without domain-specific
training data. Existing methods either rely on datasets, limiting
generalization, or cannot incorporate user intent expressed in natural
language. We introduce Prompts-to-Summaries: the first zero-shot,
text-queryable video summarizer that converts off-the-shelf video-language
models (VidLMs) captions into user-guided skims via large language models
(LLMs) judging, without the use of training data at all, beating all
unsupervised and matching supervised methods. Our pipeline (i) segments raw
video footage into coherent scenes, (ii) generates rich scene-level
descriptions through a memory-efficient, batch-style VidLM prompting scheme
that scales to hours-long videos on a single GPU, (iii) leverages an LLM as a
judge to assign scene-level importance scores under a carefully crafted prompt,
and finally, (iv) propagates those scores to short segments level via two new
metrics: consistency (temporal coherency) and uniqueness (novelty), yielding
fine-grained frame importance. On SumMe and TVSum, our data-free approach
surpasses all prior data-hungry unsupervised methods. It also performs
competitively on the Query-Focused Video Summarization (QFVS) benchmark,
despite using no training data and the competing methods requiring supervised
frame-level importance. To spur further research, we release VidSum-Reason, a
new query-driven dataset featuring long-tailed concepts and multi-step
reasoning; our framework attains robust F1 scores and serves as the first
challenging baseline. Overall, our results demonstrate that pretrained
multimodal models, when orchestrated with principled prompting and score
propagation, already provide a powerful foundation for universal,
text-queryable video summarization.

TL;DR: SmoothProper是一种即插即用的神经模块，用于解决稀疏特征和大位移挑战的无监督形变图像配准问题，通过优化层和交互项实现平滑性和结构一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无监督DIR方法在稀疏特征和大位移场景下表现不佳，因网络预测的形变场在训练后不受约束，且正则化负担完全由网络权重承担。

Method: 提出SmoothProper模块，结合基于对偶的优化层和定制交互项，实现流信号的空间传播、平滑性约束和结构一致性保持。

Result: 在视网膜血管数据集上，SmoothProper将配准误差降至1.88像素（2912x2912图像），首次有效解决稀疏特征和大位移问题。

Conclusion: SmoothPrope是一种模型无关、无需调参的解决方案，可无缝集成现有配准框架，显著提升无监督DIR性能。

Abstract: Learning-based deformable image registration (DIR) accelerates alignment by
amortizing traditional optimization via neural networks. Label supervision
further enhances accuracy, enabling efficient and precise nonlinear alignment
of unseen scans. However, images with sparse features amid large smooth
regions, such as retinal vessels, introduce aperture and large-displacement
challenges that unsupervised DIR methods struggle to address. This limitation
occurs because neural networks predict deformation fields in a single forward
pass, leaving fields unconstrained post-training and shifting the
regularization burden entirely to network weights. To address these issues, we
introduce SmoothProper, a plug-and-play neural module enforcing smoothness and
promoting message passing within the network's forward pass. By integrating a
duality-based optimization layer with tailored interaction terms, SmoothProper
efficiently propagates flow signals across spatial locations, enforces
smoothness, and preserves structural consistency. It is model-agnostic,
seamlessly integrates into existing registration frameworks with minimal
parameter overhead, and eliminates regularizer hyperparameter tuning.
Preliminary results on a retinal vessel dataset exhibiting aperture and
large-displacement challenges demonstrate our method reduces registration error
to 1.88 pixels on 2912x2912 images, marking the first unsupervised DIR approach
to effectively address both challenges. The source code will be available at
https://github.com/tinymilky/SmoothProper.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在遮挡情况下表现不佳，主要因为缺乏全局结构感知和推理能力。

Method: 提出目标聚焦掩码策略，结合多尺度特征预测SDF，并与点云融合以增强几何感知。

Result: 在DexYCB和HO3Dv2基准测试中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: HOMAE通过结合全局上下文和局部几何信息，有效解决了遮挡问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Hand-object pose estimation from monocular RGB images remains a significant
challenge mainly due to the severe occlusions inherent in hand-object
interactions. Existing methods do not sufficiently explore global structural
perception and reasoning, which limits their effectiveness in handling occluded
hand-object interactions. To address this challenge, we propose an
occlusion-aware hand-object pose estimation method based on masked
autoencoders, termed as HOMAE. Specifically, we propose a target-focused
masking strategy that imposes structured occlusion on regions of hand-object
interaction, encouraging the model to learn context-aware features and reason
about the occluded structures. We further integrate multi-scale features
extracted from the decoder to predict a signed distance field (SDF), capturing
both global context and fine-grained geometry. To enhance geometric perception,
we combine the implicit SDF with an explicit point cloud derived from the SDF,
leveraging the complementary strengths of both representations. This fusion
enables more robust handling of occluded regions by combining the global
context from the SDF with the precise local geometry provided by the point
cloud. Extensive experiments on challenging DexYCB and HO3Dv2 benchmarks
demonstrate that HOMAE achieves state-of-the-art performance in hand-object
pose estimation. We will release our code and model.

Motivation: 挑战当前普遍认为的长视频理解需要依赖多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的假设，提出一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 结合文本推理模型（LRM）和多模态工具包（如检索器和视觉感知器），通过选择性访问视频内容解决问题。

Conclusion: 代理系统在解决长视频理解问题中具有潜力，无需依赖复杂的多模态大语言模型。

Abstract: Long video understanding (LVU) presents a significant challenge for current
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) due to the task's inherent complexity
and context window constraint. It is widely assumed that addressing LVU tasks
requires foundation MLLMs with extended context windows, strong visual
perception capabilities, and proficient domain expertise. In this work, we
challenge this common belief by introducing VideoDeepResearch, a novel agentic
framework for long video understanding. Our approach relies solely on a
text-only large reasoning model (LRM) combined with a modular multi-modal
toolkit, including multimodal retrievers and visual perceivers, all of which
are readily available in practice. For each LVU task, the system formulates a
problem-solving strategy through reasoning, while selectively accessing and
utilizing essential video content via tool using. We conduct extensive
experiments on popular LVU benchmarks, including MLVU, Video-MME, and LVBench.
Our results demonstrate that VideoDeepResearch achieves substantial
improvements over existing MLLM baselines, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art by 9.6%, 6.6%, and 3.9% on MLVU (test), LVBench, and
LongVideoBench, respectively. These findings highlight the promise of agentic
systems in overcoming key challenges in LVU problems.

Motivation: 视频抠图在资源受限设备上的部署面临计算密集型模型的挑战，现有后训练量化方法在精度和时序一致性上存在不足。

Method: 提出两阶段PTQ策略（块重建优化和全局校准）、统计驱动的全局仿射校准（GAC）方法，以及光流辅助（OFA）组件。

Result: PTQ4VM在多种比特宽度下达到最先进的精度，4位量化模型性能接近全精度模型，同时计算量减少8倍。

Conclusion: PTQ4VM为视频抠图量化提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了低比特量化下的性能。

Abstract: Video matting is crucial for applications such as film production and virtual
reality, yet deploying its computationally intensive models on
resource-constrained devices presents challenges. Quantization is a key
technique for model compression and acceleration. As an efficient approach,
Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is still in its nascent stages for video
matting, facing significant hurdles in maintaining accuracy and temporal
coherence. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel and general
PTQ framework specifically designed for video matting models, marking, to the
best of our knowledge, the first systematic attempt in this domain. Our
contributions include: (1) A two-stage PTQ strategy that combines
block-reconstruction-based optimization for fast, stable initial quantization
and local dependency capture, followed by a global calibration of quantization
parameters to minimize accuracy loss. (2) A Statistically-Driven Global Affine
Calibration (GAC) method that enables the network to compensate for cumulative
statistical distortions arising from factors such as neglected BN layer
effects, even reducing the error of existing PTQ methods on video matting tasks
up to 20%. (3) An Optical Flow Assistance (OFA) component that leverages
temporal and semantic priors from frames to guide the PTQ process, enhancing
the model's ability to distinguish moving foregrounds in complex scenes and
ultimately achieving near full-precision performance even under ultra-low-bit
quantization. Comprehensive quantitative and visual results show that our
PTQ4VM achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy performance across different
bit-widths compared to the existing quantization methods. We highlight that the
4-bit PTQ4VM even achieves performance close to the full-precision counterpart
while enjoying 8x FLOP savings.

Abstract: We present VRBench, the first long narrative video benchmark crafted for
evaluating large models' multi-step reasoning capabilities, addressing
limitations in existing evaluations that overlook temporal reasoning and
procedural validity. It comprises 1,010 long videos (with an average duration
of 1.6 hours), along with 9,468 human-labeled multi-step question-answering
pairs and 30,292 reasoning steps with timestamps. These videos are curated via
a multi-stage filtering process including expert inter-rater reviewing to
prioritize plot coherence. We develop a human-AI collaborative framework that
generates coherent reasoning chains, each requiring multiple temporally
grounded steps, spanning seven types (e.g., event attribution, implicit
inference). VRBench designs a multi-phase evaluation pipeline that assesses
models at both the outcome and process levels. Apart from the MCQs for the
final results, we propose a progress-level LLM-guided scoring metric to
evaluate the quality of the reasoning chain from multiple dimensions
comprehensively. Through extensive evaluations of 12 LLMs and 16 VLMs on
VRBench, we undertake a thorough analysis and provide valuable insights that
advance the field of multi-step reasoning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有AI工具在整合用户资产、保持可编辑性和专业视觉吸引力方面的不足，推动AI辅助图形设计的普及。

Result: CreatiPoster在图形设计生成方面超越领先的开源和商业系统，并发布10万份无版权多层设计数据集。

Conclusion: CreatiPoster推动了AI辅助图形设计的民主化，支持多种应用场景。

Abstract: Graphic design plays a crucial role in both commercial and personal contexts,
yet creating high-quality, editable, and aesthetically pleasing graphic
compositions remains a time-consuming and skill-intensive task, especially for
beginners. Current AI tools automate parts of the workflow, but struggle to
accurately incorporate user-supplied assets, maintain editability, and achieve
professional visual appeal. Commercial systems, like Canva Magic Design, rely
on vast template libraries, which are impractical for replicate. In this paper,
we introduce CreatiPoster, a framework that generates editable, multi-layer
compositions from optional natural-language instructions or assets. A protocol
model, an RGBA large multimodal model, first produces a JSON specification
detailing every layer (text or asset) with precise layout, hierarchy, content
and style, plus a concise background prompt. A conditional background model
then synthesizes a coherent background conditioned on this rendered foreground
layers. We construct a benchmark with automated metrics for graphic-design
generation and show that CreatiPoster surpasses leading open-source approaches
and proprietary commercial systems. To catalyze further research, we release a
copyright-free corpus of 100,000 multi-layer designs. CreatiPoster supports
diverse applications such as canvas editing, text overlay, responsive resizing,
multilingual adaptation, and animated posters, advancing the democratization of
AI-assisted graphic design. Project homepage:

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种零样本生成模型适应方法（ZSGM），通过分析CLIP嵌入空间中的偏移不对齐问题，提出了一种迭代优化方法（AIR），显著提升了生成图像的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ZSGM方法假设图像偏移与文本偏移在CLIP嵌入空间中完全对齐，导致生成图像质量下降。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过实证研究分析CLIP嵌入空间中的偏移不对齐现象，并提出迭代优化方法（AIR）来改进生成质量。

Result: 在26种实验设置中，AIR方法在定性和定量评估中均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: AIR方法通过关注偏移不对齐问题，显著提升了零样本生成模型适应性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot generative model adaptation (ZSGM) aims to adapt a pre-trained
generator to a target domain using only text guidance and without any samples
from the target domain. Central to recent ZSGM approaches are directional loss
which use the text guidance in the form of aligning the image offset with text
offset in the embedding space of a vision-language model like CLIP. This is
similar to the analogical reasoning in NLP where the offset between one pair of
words is used to identify a missing element in another pair by aligning the
offset between these two pairs. However, a major limitation of existing ZSGM
methods is that the learning objective assumes the complete alignment between
image offset and text offset in the CLIP embedding space, resulting in quality
degrade in generated images. Our work makes two main contributions. Inspired by
the offset misalignment studies in NLP, as our first contribution, we perform
an empirical study to analyze the misalignment between text offset and image
offset in CLIP embedding space for various large publicly available datasets.
Our important finding is that offset misalignment in CLIP embedding space is
correlated with concept distance, i.e., close concepts have a less offset
misalignment. To address the limitations of the current approaches, as our
second contribution, we propose Adaptation with Iterative Refinement (AIR)
which is the first ZSGM approach to focus on improving target domain image
quality based on our new insight on offset misalignment.Qualitative,
quantitative, and user study in 26 experiment setups consistently demonstrate
the proposed AIR approach achieves SOTA performance. Additional experiments are
in Supp.

Result: M4V在768×1280分辨率下生成视频时，FLOPs减少45%，并在实验中表现出高质量的视频生成能力。

Conclusion: M4V通过高效的多模态和时空建模，为文本到视频生成提供了一种计算成本低且质量高的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-video generation has significantly enriched content creation and
holds the potential to evolve into powerful world simulators. However, modeling
the vast spatiotemporal space remains computationally demanding, particularly
when employing Transformers, which incur quadratic complexity in sequence
processing and thus limit practical applications. Recent advancements in
linear-time sequence modeling, particularly the Mamba architecture, offer a
more efficient alternative. Nevertheless, its plain design limits its direct
applicability to multi-modal and spatiotemporal video generation tasks. To
address these challenges, we introduce M4V, a Multi-Modal Mamba framework for
text-to-video generation. Specifically, we propose a multi-modal diffusion
Mamba (MM-DiM) block that enables seamless integration of multi-modal
information and spatiotemporal modeling through a multi-modal token
re-composition design. As a result, the Mamba blocks in M4V reduce FLOPs by 45%
compared to the attention-based alternative when generating videos at
768$\times$1280 resolution. Additionally, to mitigate the visual quality
degradation in long-context autoregressive generation processes, we introduce a
reward learning strategy that further enhances per-frame visual realism.
Extensive experiments on text-to-video benchmarks demonstrate M4V's ability to
produce high-quality videos while significantly lowering computational costs.

Conclusion: 直接从视频学习上下文图像编辑是可行的，且模型在多任务中展现出潜力。

Abstract: In-context image editing aims to modify images based on a contextual sequence
comprising text and previously generated images. Existing methods typically
depend on task-specific pipelines and expert models (e.g., segmentation and
inpainting) to curate training data. In this work, we explore whether an
in-context image editing model can be learned directly from videos. We
introduce a scalable approach to annotate videos as interleaved multimodal
sequences. To effectively learn from this data, we design a block-causal
diffusion transformer trained on three proxy tasks: next-image prediction,
current segmentation prediction, and next-segmentation prediction.
Additionally, we propose a novel multi-turn image editing benchmark to advance
research in this area. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model
exhibits strong in-context image editing capabilities and achieves
state-of-the-art results on two multi-turn image editing benchmarks. Despite
being trained exclusively on videos, our model also shows promising abilities
in multi-concept composition, story generation, and chain-of-editing
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将图像块作为空间并行序列进行自回归生成，但图像块本质上是并行的，与自回归的因果性相矛盾。

Method: 通过嵌套频谱标记化将图像转换为有序频谱标记，从低频到高频逐步生成，实现粗到细的自回归生成。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上，仅用64个标记和310M参数，SpectralAR达到了3.02 gFID。

Conclusion: SpectralAR在保证序列因果性和标记效率的同时，实现了高质量的视觉生成。

Abstract: Autoregressive visual generation has garnered increasing attention due to its
scalability and compatibility with other modalities compared with diffusion
models. Most existing methods construct visual sequences as spatial patches for
autoregressive generation. However, image patches are inherently parallel,
contradicting the causal nature of autoregressive modeling. To address this, we
propose a Spectral AutoRegressive (SpectralAR) visual generation framework,
which realizes causality for visual sequences from the spectral perspective.
Specifically, we first transform an image into ordered spectral tokens with
Nested Spectral Tokenization, representing lower to higher frequency
components. We then perform autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine
manner with the sequences of spectral tokens. By considering different levels
of detail in images, our SpectralAR achieves both sequence causality and token
efficiency without bells and whistles. We conduct extensive experiments on
ImageNet-1K for image reconstruction and autoregressive generation, and
SpectralAR achieves 3.02 gFID with only 64 tokens and 310M parameters. Project

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce knowledge image generation as a new task,
alongside the Massive Multi-Discipline Multi-Tier Knowledge-Image Generation
Benchmark (MMMG) to probe the reasoning capability of image generation models.
Knowledge images have been central to human civilization and to the mechanisms
of human learning--a fact underscored by dual-coding theory and the
picture-superiority effect. Generating such images is challenging, demanding
multimodal reasoning that fuses world knowledge with pixel-level grounding into
clear explanatory visuals. To enable comprehensive evaluation, MMMG offers
4,456 expert-validated (knowledge) image-prompt pairs spanning 10 disciplines,
6 educational levels, and diverse knowledge formats such as charts, diagrams,
and mind maps. To eliminate confounding complexity during evaluation, we adopt
a unified Knowledge Graph (KG) representation. Each KG explicitly delineates a
target image's core entities and their dependencies. We further introduce
MMMG-Score to evaluate generated knowledge images. This metric combines factual
fidelity, measured by graph-edit distance between KGs, with visual clarity
assessment. Comprehensive evaluations of 16 state-of-the-art text-to-image
generation models expose serious reasoning deficits--low entity fidelity, weak
relations, and clutter--with GPT-4o achieving an MMMG-Score of only 50.20,
underscoring the benchmark's difficulty. To spur further progress, we release
FLUX-Reason (MMMG-Score of 34.45), an effective and open baseline that combines
a reasoning LLM with diffusion models and is trained on 16,000 curated
knowledge image-prompt pairs.

Result: 在多种MLLMs上达到SOTA性能，显著降低计算开销（如LLaVA的FLOPs减少95%），同时保持高精度。

Conclusion: CDPruner通过条件多样性优化令牌选择，高效平衡性能与计算成本，适用于多种MLLMs。

Abstract: In multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the length of input visual
tokens is often significantly greater than that of their textual counterparts,
leading to a high inference cost. Many works aim to address this issue by
removing redundant visual tokens. However, current approaches either rely on
attention-based pruning, which retains numerous duplicate tokens, or use
similarity-based pruning, overlooking the instruction relevance, consequently
causing suboptimal performance. In this paper, we go beyond attention or
similarity by proposing a novel visual token pruning method named CDPruner,
which maximizes the conditional diversity of retained tokens. We first define
the conditional similarity between visual tokens conditioned on the
instruction, and then reformulate the token pruning problem with determinantal
point process (DPP) to maximize the conditional diversity of the selected
subset. The proposed CDPruner is training-free and model-agnostic, allowing
easy application to various MLLMs. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs
show that CDPruner establishes new state-of-the-art on various vision-language
benchmarks. By maximizing conditional diversity through DPP, the selected
subset better represents the input images while closely adhering to user
instructions, thereby preserving strong performance even with high reduction
ratios. When applied to LLaVA, CDPruner reduces FLOPs by 95\% and CUDA latency
by 78\%, while maintaining 94\% of the original accuracy. Our code is available

paper, we propose GenWorld, a large-scale, high-quality, and real-world
simulation dataset for AI-generated video detection. GenWorld features the
following characteristics: (1) Real-world Simulation: GenWorld focuses on
videos that replicate real-world scenarios, which have a significant impact due
to their realism and potential influence; (2) High Quality: GenWorld employs
multiple state-of-the-art video generation models to provide realistic and
high-quality forged videos; (3) Cross-prompt Diversity: GenWorld includes
videos generated from diverse generators and various prompt modalities (e.g.,
text, image, video), offering the potential to learn more generalizable
forensic features. We analyze existing methods and find they fail to detect
high-quality videos generated by world models (i.e., Cosmos), revealing
potential drawbacks of ignoring real-world clues. To address this, we propose a
simple yet effective model, SpannDetector, to leverage multi-view consistency
as a strong criterion for real-world AI-generated video detection. Experiments
show that our method achieves superior results, highlighting a promising
direction for explainable AI-generated video detection based on physical
plausibility. We believe that GenWorld will advance the field of AI-generated
video detection. Project Page: https://chen-wl20.github.io/GenWorld

Abstract: 3D occupancy prediction is crucial for robust autonomous driving systems as
it enables comprehensive perception of environmental structures and semantics.
Most existing methods employ dense voxel-based scene representations, ignoring
the sparsity of driving scenes and resulting in inefficiency. Recent works
explore object-centric representations based on sparse Gaussians, but their
ellipsoidal shape prior limits the modeling of diverse structures. In
real-world driving scenes, objects exhibit rich geometries (e.g., cuboids,
cylinders, and irregular shapes), necessitating excessive ellipsoidal Gaussians
densely packed for accurate modeling, which leads to inefficient
representations. To address this, we propose to use geometrically expressive
superquadrics as scene primitives, enabling efficient representation of complex
structures with fewer primitives through their inherent shape diversity. We
develop a probabilistic superquadric mixture model, which interprets each
superquadric as an occupancy probability distribution with a corresponding
geometry prior, and calculates semantics through probabilistic mixture.
Building on this, we present QuadricFormer, a superquadric-based model for
efficient 3D occupancy prediction, and introduce a pruning-and-splitting module
to further enhance modeling efficiency by concentrating superquadrics in
occupied regions. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate
that QuadricFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining
superior efficiency.

<details>

Motivation: 现有注意力扰动方法缺乏确定扰动位置的原则性方法，尤其是在DiT架构中，质量相关计算分布在多个层中。

Method: 研究注意力扰动的粒度，从层级到单个注意力头，提出HeadHunter框架和SoftPAG方法。

Result: 在Stable Diffusion 3和FLUX.1等模型上验证，实现了生成质量和视觉属性的精细控制。

Conclusion: 首次在扩散模型中进行了头级注意力扰动分析，揭示了注意力层的可解释性，并提供了有效的扰动策略设计。

Abstract: Recent guidance methods in diffusion models steer reverse sampling by
perturbing the model to construct an implicit weak model and guide generation
away from it. Among these approaches, attention perturbation has demonstrated
strong empirical performance in unconditional scenarios where classifier-free
guidance is not applicable. However, existing attention perturbation methods
lack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be
applied, particularly in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures where
quality-relevant computations are distributed across layers. In this paper, we
investigate the granularity of attention perturbations, ranging from the layer
level down to individual attention heads, and discover that specific heads
govern distinct visual concepts such as structure, style, and texture quality.
Building on this insight, we propose "HeadHunter", a systematic framework for
iteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives,
enabling fine-grained control over generation quality and visual attributes. In
addition, we introduce SoftPAG, which linearly interpolates each selected
head's attention map toward an identity matrix, providing a continuous knob to
tune perturbation strength and suppress artifacts. Our approach not only
mitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but
also enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through
compositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale
DiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1,
demonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and
style-specific guidance. Our work provides the first head-level analysis of
attention perturbation in diffusion models, uncovering interpretable
specialization within attention layers and enabling practical design of
effective perturbation strategies.

Result: 在标准基准测试中表现优异，支持灵活的下游应用（如物体插入和多区域修复）。

Conclusion: InstaInpaint在速度和性能上均优于现有方法，适用于实时3D场景修复。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D scene reconstruction enable real-time viewing in
virtual and augmented reality. To support interactive operations for better
immersiveness, such as moving or editing objects, 3D scene inpainting methods
are proposed to repair or complete the altered geometry. However, current
approaches rely on lengthy and computationally intensive optimization, making
them impractical for real-time or online applications. We propose InstaInpaint,
a reference-based feed-forward framework that produces 3D-scene inpainting from
a 2D inpainting proposal within 0.4 seconds. We develop a self-supervised
masked-finetuning strategy to enable training of our custom large
reconstruction model (LRM) on the large-scale dataset. Through extensive
experiments, we analyze and identify several key designs that improve
generalization, textural consistency, and geometric correctness. InstaInpaint
achieves a 1000x speed-up from prior methods while maintaining a
state-of-the-art performance across two standard benchmarks. Moreover, we show
that InstaInpaint generalizes well to flexible downstream applications such as
object insertion and multi-region inpainting. More video results are available

Result: 方法在多样数据集上展示了生成新视图合成的优越一致性和合理性。

Conclusion: SceneCompleter通过融合结构和纹理信息，实现了视觉连贯且3D一致的生成场景补全。

Abstract: Generative models have gained significant attention in novel view synthesis
(NVS) by alleviating the reliance on dense multi-view captures. However,
existing methods typically fall into a conventional paradigm, where generative
models first complete missing areas in 2D, followed by 3D recovery techniques
to reconstruct the scene, which often results in overly smooth surfaces and
distorted geometry, as generative models struggle to infer 3D structure solely
from RGB data. In this paper, we propose SceneCompleter, a novel framework that
achieves 3D-consistent generative novel view synthesis through dense 3D scene
completion. SceneCompleter achieves both visual coherence and 3D-consistent
generative scene completion through two key components: (1) a
geometry-appearance dual-stream diffusion model that jointly synthesizes novel
views in RGBD space; (2) a scene embedder that encodes a more holistic scene
understanding from the reference image. By effectively fusing structural and
textural information, our method demonstrates superior coherence and
plausibility in generative novel view synthesis across diverse datasets.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于深度学习的新型密度均衡映射框架（LDEM），解决了传统方法在精度、重叠伪影和从2D扩展到3D时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统密度均衡映射方法存在精度不足、极端情况下产生重叠伪影以及从2D扩展到3D时需要大量算法重构的问题。

Method: 通过深度学习网络设计了一种损失函数，强制密度均匀性和几何规则性，并采用分层方法预测粗粒度和密集级别的变换。

Result: LDEM在多种简单和复杂密度分布下表现出优于现有方法的密度均衡性和双射性，且能轻松应用于表面重网格化。

Conclusion: LDEM为密度均衡映射的稳健计算提供了新可能性，并实现了从2D到3D的无缝扩展。

Abstract: Density-equalizing map (DEM) serves as a powerful technique for creating
shape deformations with the area changes reflecting an underlying density
function. In recent decades, DEM has found widespread applications in fields
such as data visualization, geometry processing, and medical imaging.
Traditional approaches to DEM primarily rely on iterative numerical solvers for
diffusion equations or optimization-based methods that minimize handcrafted
energy functionals. However, these conventional techniques often face several
challenges: they may suffer from limited accuracy, produce overlapping
artifacts in extreme cases, and require substantial algorithmic redesign when
extended from 2D to 3D, due to the derivative-dependent nature of their energy
formulations. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based
density-equalizing mapping framework (LDEM) using deep neural networks.
Specifically, we introduce a loss function that enforces density uniformity and
geometric regularity, and utilize a hierarchical approach to predict the
transformations at both the coarse and dense levels. Our method demonstrates
superior density-equalizing and bijectivity properties compared to prior
methods for a wide range of simple and complex density distributions, and can
be easily applied to surface remeshing with different effects. Also, it
generalizes seamlessly from 2D to 3D domains without structural changes to the
model architecture or loss formulation. Altogether, our work opens up new
possibilities for scalable and robust computation of density-equalizing maps
for practical applications.

TL;DR: FastFLUX是一种架构级剪枝框架，旨在提升FLUX模型的推理效率，通过BRLL方法和ST策略，在保持图像质量的同时显著加速推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2I生成模型（如FLUX）参数量大，导致推理慢、内存占用高且部署困难，现有加速方法性能下降明显且训练成本高。

Method: 提出Block-wise Replacement with Linear Layers (BRLL)方法替换复杂残差分支，并引入Sandwich Training (ST)策略进行局部微调。

Result: 实验表明，FastFLUX在剪枝20%层级后仍保持高质量图像生成，同时显著提升推理速度。

Conclusion: FastFLUX通过结构优化和局部训练策略，有效解决了模型效率与性能的平衡问题。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) generation have led to the
emergence of highly expressive models such as diffusion transformers (DiTs),
exemplified by FLUX. However, their massive parameter sizes lead to slow
inference, high memory usage, and poor deployability. Existing acceleration
methods (e.g., single-step distillation and attention pruning) often suffer
from significant performance degradation and incur substantial training costs.
To address these limitations, we propose FastFLUX, an architecture-level
pruning framework designed to enhance the inference efficiency of FLUX. At its
core is the Block-wise Replacement with Linear Layers (BRLL) method, which
replaces structurally complex residual branches in ResBlocks with lightweight
linear layers while preserving the original shortcut connections for stability.
Furthermore, we introduce Sandwich Training (ST), a localized fine-tuning
strategy that leverages LoRA to supervise neighboring blocks, mitigating
performance drops caused by structural replacement. Experiments show that our
FastFLUX maintains high image quality under both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations, while significantly improving inference speed, even with 20\% of
the hierarchy pruned. Our code will be available soon.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Token Perturbation Guidance (TPG)的新方法，通过直接扰动扩散网络中的中间令牌表示，无需训练即可提升生成质量。TPG在无条件生成中显著优于基线模型，同时保持与CFG相似的提示对齐能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Classifier-free guidance (CFG)需要特定训练且仅适用于条件生成，限制了其应用范围。TPG旨在克服这些限制，提供一种无需训练且适用于任何输入条件的通用方法。

Method: TPG通过规范保持的扰动操作直接作用于扩散网络的中间令牌表示，提供稳定且有效的指导信号。

Result: 实验表明，TPG在无条件生成中FID提升近2倍，同时在提示对齐方面与CFG表现相近。

Conclusion: TPG是一种通用且无需训练的指导方法，能够为更广泛的扩散模型带来类似CFG的优势。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has become an essential component of modern
diffusion models to enhance both generation quality and alignment with input
conditions. However, CFG requires specific training procedures and is limited
to conditional generation. To address these limitations, we propose Token
Perturbation Guidance (TPG), a novel method that applies perturbation matrices
directly to intermediate token representations within the diffusion network.
TPG employs a norm-preserving shuffling operation to provide effective and
stable guidance signals that improve generation quality without architectural
changes. As a result, TPG is training-free and agnostic to input conditions,
making it readily applicable to both conditional and unconditional generation.
We further analyze the guidance term provided by TPG and show that its effect
on sampling more closely resembles CFG compared to existing training-free
guidance techniques. Extensive experiments on SDXL and Stable Diffusion 2.1
show that TPG achieves nearly a 2$\times$ improvement in FID for unconditional
generation over the SDXL baseline, while closely matching CFG in prompt
alignment. These results establish TPG as a general, condition-agnostic
guidance method that brings CFG-like benefits to a broader class of diffusion
models. The code is available at

Motivation: 传统扩散模型依赖高质量数据集，但低质量图像常被丢弃。论文旨在利用这些图像提升模型性能。

Method: 提出Ambient Diffusion Omni框架，基于图像的光谱幂律衰减和局部性，从所有可用图像中提取信号。

Result: 在ImageNet上达到SOTA FID，显著提升文本到图像生成的质量和多样性。

Conclusion: 噪声可缓解高质量分布与混合分布间的初始偏差，理论分析验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: We show how to use low-quality, synthetic, and out-of-distribution images to
improve the quality of a diffusion model. Typically, diffusion models are
trained on curated datasets that emerge from highly filtered data pools from
the Web and other sources. We show that there is immense value in the
lower-quality images that are often discarded. We present Ambient Diffusion
Omni, a simple, principled framework to train diffusion models that can extract
signal from all available images during training. Our framework exploits two
properties of natural images -- spectral power law decay and locality. We first
validate our framework by successfully training diffusion models with images
synthetically corrupted by Gaussian blur, JPEG compression, and motion blur. We
then use our framework to achieve state-of-the-art ImageNet FID, and we show
significant improvements in both image quality and diversity for text-to-image
generative modeling. The core insight is that noise dampens the initial skew
between the desired high-quality distribution and the mixed distribution we
actually observe. We provide rigorous theoretical justification for our
approach by analyzing the trade-off between learning from biased data versus
limited unbiased data across diffusion times.

Conclusion: 该方法低成本、高效，解决了现有虚拟试衣的局限性，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Existing image-based virtual try-on methods are often limited to the front
view and lack real-time performance. While per-garment virtual try-on methods
have tackled these issues by capturing per-garment datasets and training
per-garment neural networks, they still encounter practical limitations: (1)
the robotic mannequin used to capture per-garment datasets is prohibitively
expensive for widespread adoption and fails to accurately replicate natural
human body deformation; (2) the synthesized garments often misalign with the
human body. To address these challenges, we propose a low-barrier approach for
collecting per-garment datasets using real human bodies, eliminating the
necessity for a customized robotic mannequin. We also introduce a hybrid person
representation that enhances the existing intermediate representation with a
simplified DensePose map. This ensures accurate alignment of synthesized
garment images with the human body and enables human-garment interaction
without the need for customized wearable devices. We performed qualitative and
quantitative evaluations against other state-of-the-art image-based virtual
try-on methods and conducted ablation studies to demonstrate the superiority of
our method regarding image quality and temporal consistency. Finally, our user
study results indicated that most participants found our virtual try-on system
helpful for making garment purchasing decisions.

Result: Edit360能够生成高质量的多视角序列，支持可定制的3D内容重建。

Conclusion: Edit360为3D资产编辑提供了一种灵活且实用的解决方案，扩展了扩散模型的应用范围。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved image
generation and editing, but extending these capabilities to 3D assets remains
challenging, especially for fine-grained edits that require multi-view
consistency. Existing methods typically restrict editing to predetermined
viewing angles, severely limiting their flexibility and practical applications.
We introduce Edit360, a tuning-free framework that extends 2D modifications to
multi-view consistent 3D editing. Built upon video diffusion models, Edit360
enables user-specific editing from arbitrary viewpoints while ensuring
structural coherence across all views. The framework selects anchor views for
2D modifications and propagates edits across the entire 360-degree range. To
achieve this, Edit360 introduces a novel Anchor-View Editing Propagation
mechanism, which effectively aligns and merges multi-view information within
the latent and attention spaces of diffusion models. The resulting edited
multi-view sequences facilitate the reconstruction of high-quality 3D assets,
enabling customizable 3D content creation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型动态校准方法，突破了IMU校准中的静态假设限制，实现了实时估计坐标漂移和测量偏移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IMU校准方法依赖静态假设，限制了应用场景。本文旨在通过动态校准方法扩展IMU的使用范围。

Method: 基于两个宽松假设（短时间窗口内矩阵变化微小且运动多样），使用Transformer模型学习矩阵与IMU读数的映射关系，并设计校准触发器。

Result: 首次实现了隐式IMU校准和稀疏IMU的长期精确运动捕捉。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了IMU校准的灵活性和实用性，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic calibration method for sparse
inertial motion capture systems, which is the first to break the restrictive
absolute static assumption in IMU calibration, i.e., the coordinate drift RG'G
and measurement offset RBS remain constant during the entire motion, thereby
significantly expanding their application scenarios. Specifically, we achieve
real-time estimation of RG'G and RBS under two relaxed assumptions: i) the
matrices change negligibly in a short time window; ii) the human movements/IMU
readings are diverse in such a time window. Intuitively, the first assumption
reduces the number of candidate matrices, and the second assumption provides
diverse constraints, which greatly reduces the solution space and allows for
accurate estimation of RG'G and RBS from a short history of IMU readings in
real time. To achieve this, we created synthetic datasets of paired RG'G, RBS
matrices and IMU readings, and learned their mappings using a Transformer-based
model. We also designed a calibration trigger based on the diversity of IMU
readings to ensure that assumption ii) is met before applying our method. To
our knowledge, we are the first to achieve implicit IMU calibration (i.e.,
seamlessly putting IMUs into use without the need for an explicit calibration
process), as well as the first to enable long-term and accurate motion capture
using sparse IMUs. The code and dataset are available at

Conclusion: 互补基尼指数和纳什福利为设施选址问题中的公平性提供了可行的替代方案，但策略证明机制在基尼指数上的限制仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: We consider strategy proof mechanisms for facility location which maximize
equitability between agents. As is common in the literature, we measure
equitability with the Gini index. We first prove a simple but fundamental
impossibility result that no strategy proof mechanism can bound the
approximation ratio of the optimal Gini index of utilities for one or more
facilities. We propose instead computing approximation ratios of the
complemented Gini index of utilities, and consider how well both deterministic
and randomized mechanisms approximate this. In addition, as Nash welfare is
often put forwards as an equitable compromise between egalitarian and
utilitarian outcomes, we consider how well mechanisms approximate the Nash
welfare.

Abstract: We study diversity in approval-based committee elections with incomplete or
inaccurate information. As standard in the literature on approval-based
multi-winner voting, we define diversity according to the maximum coverage
problem, which is known to be NP-complete, with a best attainable polynomial
time approximation ratio of $1-1/\e$. In the incomplete information model,
voters can vote on only a small portion of the candidates. We suggest a greedy
algorithm and a local search algorithm that query voters and use the query
responses to approximate the total population's opinion. For both algorithms,
we prove an upper bound on the number of queries required to get a close to
$(1-1/\e)$-approximate solution with high probability. We also provide a lower
bound for the query complexity of non-adaptive algorithms, that cannot adapt
their querying strategy to readily obtained information. In the inaccurate
information setting, voters' responses are corrupted with a probability
$p\in(0,\frac{1}{2})$. We provide both an upper and a lower bound for the
number of queries required to attain a $(1-1/\e)$-approximate solution with
high probability. Finally, using real data from Polis, we see that our
algorithms perform remarkably better than the theoretical results suggest, both
with incomplete and inaccurate information.

Abstract: We describe DANCE^2, an interactive dance performance in which audience
members channel their collective agency into a dancer-robot duet by voting on
the behavior of a wearable robot affixed to the dancer's body. At key moments
during the performance, the audience is invited to either continue the
choreography or override it, shaping the unfolding interaction through
real-time collective input. While post-performance surveys revealed that
participants felt their choices meaningfully influenced the performance, voting
data across four public performances exhibited strikingly consistent patterns.
This tension between what audience members do, what they feel, and what
actually changes highlights a complex interplay between agentive behavior, the
experience of agency, and power. We reflect on how choreography, interaction
design, and the structure of the performance mediate this relationship,
offering a live analogy for algorithmically curated digital systems where
agency is felt, but not exercised.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学生在学习不熟悉的数据可视化技术（如PCPs）时面临挑战，研究旨在探索有效的教学方法。

Method: 采用修订版布鲁姆分类法，结合掌握学习法，在数据可视化课程中进行干预实验。

Result: 掌握学习组在高级思维模块（分析、评估）表现更好，对PCPs的理解更深入。

Conclusion: 掌握学习法有助于提升学生对PCPs的高级思维能力，相关教学材料已公开。

Abstract: Developing literacy with unfamiliar data visualization techniques such as
Parallel Coordinate Plots (PCPs) can be a significant challenge for students.
We adopted the Revised Bloom's taxonomy to instruct students on Parallel
Coordinate Plots (PCPs) using Mastery Learning in the classroom. To evaluate
Mastery Learning's impact, we conducted an intervention in a Data Visualization
course to teach students about PCPs using the Revised Bloom's taxonomy with and
without Mastery Learning. Based on our intervention, we found that while
students in both groups performed similarly on the first two (Remember,
Understand) modules, the students in the Mastery Learning group performed
better on modules that required more advanced thinking (Analyze, Evaluate) and
demonstrated a better comprehension of PCPs. We provide all the materials
developed including the six-module Bloom's Taxonomy PCP literacy (BTPL) test
for full reproducibility on our website at

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究探讨了韩国移民家庭如何通过文化价值观和策略性使用AI工具（如ChatGPT和智能助手）来应对代际、语言和文化挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI深入家庭生活，移民家庭面临独特的代际、语言和文化挑战，需探索其如何适应和使用AI工具。

Method: 通过20次半结构化访谈，研究分析了父母和青少年在AI使用中的实践。

Result: 发现两种关键实践：父母通过文化价值观中介AI使用的“解释性把关”，以及青少年为实用目的推迟批判性评估的“便利性批判延迟”。

Conclusion: AI素养是动态且关系性的实践，需设计更公平、文化敏感和以家庭为中心的AI系统。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes deeply integrated into family life,
immigrant families must navigate unique intergenerational, linguistic, and
cultural challenges. This study examines how Korean immigrant families in the
United States negotiate the use of AI tools such as ChatGPT and smart
assistants in their homes. Through 20 semi-structured interviews with parents
and teens, we identify two key practices that shape their engagement:
interpretive gatekeeping, where parents mediate their children's AI use through
a lens of cultural and ethical values, and convenient critical deferment, where
teens strategically postpone critical evaluation of AI for immediate academic
and social utility. These intertwined practices challenge conventional,
skills-based models of AI literacy, revealing it instead as a dynamic and
relational practice co-constructed through ongoing family negotiation. We
contribute to information science and HCI by offering a new conceptual
extension for intergenerational AI literacy and providing design implications
for more equitable, culturally attuned, and family-centered AI systems.

Abstract: In this position paper, we first discuss the uptake of speculative design as
a method for Indigenous HCI. Then, we outline how a key assumption about
temporality threatens to undermine the usefulness of speculative design in this
context. Finally, we briefly sketch out a possible alternative understanding of
speculative design, based on the concept of "spiraling time," which could be
better suited for Indigenous HCI.

Motivation: 明确AI如何有效增强人类创造力，填补理论与实践的空白。

Method: 基于分布式创造力视角，提出三种AI贡献模式（支持、协同、共生），分析其技术自主性和感知代理性维度。

Result: 不同模式对创造力（从日常问题解决到范式创新）有不同影响，并涉及理论、伦理和设计问题。

Conclusion: AI与人类创造力的结合需综合考虑技术、感知和伦理因素，以实现最佳协同效果。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence holds significant potential to enhance human
creativity. However, achieving this vision requires a clearer understanding of
how such enhancement can be effectively realized. Adopting the perspective of
distributed creativity, we identify three primary modes through which AI can
contribute to creative processes: Support, where AI acts as a tool; Synergy,
where AI and humans collaborate in complementary ways; and Symbiosis, where
human and AI cognition become so integrated that they form a unified creative
system. These modes are defined along two key dimensions: the level of
technical autonomy exhibited by the AI system and the degree of perceived
agency attributed to it. We examine how each configuration influences different
levels of creativity - from everyday problem-solving to paradigm-shifting
innovation - and discuss the theoretical, ethical, and design implications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前无障碍标准虽灵活，但常被静态化为合规清单，缺乏用户中心化。

Method: 引入可定制的Comfort Mode框架，允许用户调整界面设置（如对比度、字体、动画等），同时保留品牌视觉核心。

Result: 通过最小化和高级实现模型展示低成本无缝集成包容性设计的方法。

Conclusion: 该框架可扩展、适应性强，为用户自主、美学完整性和无障碍提供新范式，无需妥协。

Abstract: This paper proposes a shift from compliance-centered web accessibility to a
care-driven model that prioritizes user autonomy, using neurodivergent users as
a catalyst case for broader personalization needs. While accessibility
standards offer a flexible framework, they are often interpreted and
implemented as static compliance checklists, our approach reframes it as a
flexible, user-centered process. We introduce a customizable Comfort Mode
framework that allows users to adapt interface settings, such as contrast,
typography, motion, and scaling, according to their individual needs, while
retaining the brand's core visual identity. Grounded in psychological and
cognitive accessibility principles, our design supports personalization without
sacrificing creative freedom. We present both minimal and advanced
implementation models with mock-ups, demonstrating how inclusive design can be
seamlessly integrated at minimal cost. This approach aims to broaden digital
inclusivity by offering autonomy to those who require it, without imposing
changes on those who do not. The proposed system is adaptable, scalable, and
suitable for a wide range of users and brands, offering a new paradigm where
user autonomy, aesthetic integrity, and accessibility converge not through
compromise, but through choice.

Motivation: 设计空间依赖设计师经验且缺乏数学形式化，限制了自动化设计支持。

Method: IDEA框架结合LLMs生成约束，MCTS算法探索设计空间，并将抽象决策转化为具体实现。

Result: 在文章排版和可视化生成场景中，IDEA表现出跨领域适应性和高效设计能力。

Conclusion: IDEA通过形式化设计空间和智能决策支持，显著提升了设计效率和结果质量。

Abstract: Design spaces serve as a conceptual framework that enables designers to
explore feasible solutions through the selection and combination of design
elements. However, effective decision-making remains heavily dependent on the
designer's experience, and the absence of mathematical formalization prevents
computational support for automated design processes. To bridge this gap, we
introduce a structured representation that models design spaces with orthogonal
dimensions and discrete selectable elements. Building on this model, we present
IDEA, a decision-making framework for augmenting design intelligence through
design space exploration to generate effective outcomes. Specifically, IDEA
leverages large language models (LLMs) for constraint generation, incorporates
a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm guided by these constraints to
explore the design space efficiently, and instantiates abstract decisions into
domain-specific implementations. We validate IDEA in two design scenarios:
data-driven article composition and pictorial visualization generation,
supported by example results, expert interviews, and a user study. The
evaluation demonstrates the IDEA's adaptability across domains and its
capability to produce superior design outcomes.

Method: 采用"大声思考"实验和定性观察访谈，分析学生在Visual Studio Code IDE中的学习与互动。

Result: 识别出三个主题：自信心、互动和学习，揭示了当前IDE设计带来的挫败感和障碍。

Conclusion: 需优化IDE设计以提升ADHD学生的用户体验和学习效果。

Abstract: Coding forms a key part of computer science education in universities. As
part of this education, Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are
essential tools for coding. However, it is currently unknown how the design of
an IDE's interface impacts on students with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
Disorder (ADHD).
  In this study we investigated the use of IDEs by students with ADHD. We
conducted a think aloud study with nine university computing students, followed
by qualitative observational interviews to analyse their learning and
engagement with the Visual Studio Code IDE. The paper reports on these
experiences and seeks to understand the role IDEs play in the educational
setting.
  Our work also examines how digital accessibility and usability are considered
in the current design of IDEs. We analysed the qualitative data using a
thematic analysis and identified three primary themes: self-confidence,
interaction, and learning as well as various sub-themes.
  The themes and their sub-themes illustrate key areas of consideration when
designing IDEs for students with ADHD. The primary findings highlight
experiences of frustration and barriers in the current design and layout of
IDEs.
  Through our participatory approach we provide a rare insight into ADHD user
experiences around usability and accessibility, and describe the need for
better design of development environments to ensure a positive learning
experience for the students.

Motivation: 传统动画工作流程对非专业人士存在操作复杂的问题，限制了创意生产力。

Method: 采用基于代理的双流管道，结合上下文感知的内联建议和对话引导，并通过语义-动画映射实现LLM驱动的创意意图翻译。

Result: 用户研究表明，该系统能有效帮助非专业用户完成动画工作流程，验证了管道的可行性。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持进一步探索LLM在视频创作工作流中的整合。

Abstract: Text animation, a foundational element in video creation, enables efficient
and cost-effective communication, thriving in advertisements, journalism, and
social media. However, traditional animation workflows present significant
usability barriers for non-professionals, with intricate operational procedures
severely hindering creative productivity. To address this, we propose a Large
Language Model (LLM)-aided text animation editing system that enables real-time
intent tracking and flexible editing. The system introduces an agent-based
dual-stream pipeline that integrates context-aware inline suggestions and
conversational guidance as well as employs a semantic-animation mapping to
facilitate LLM-driven creative intent translation. Besides, the system supports
synchronized text-animation previews and parametric adjustments via unified
controls to improve editing workflow. A user study evaluates the system,
highlighting its ability to help non-professional users complete animation
workflows while validating the pipeline. The findings encourage further
exploration of integrating LLMs into a comprehensive video creation workflow.

Result: LSTM网络预测抓取时间的精度优于21毫秒，距离精度优于1厘米，目标大小预测准确率超过97%。

Conclusion: 研究结果为设计自适应、细粒度的交互用户界面（如混合现实环境）提供了重要依据。

Abstract: The ability to predict the object the user intends to grasp offers essential
contextual information and may help to leverage the effects of point-to-point
latency in interactive environments. This paper explores the feasibility and
accuracy of real-time recognition of uninstrumented objects based on hand
kinematics during reach-to-grasp actions. In a data collection study, we
recorded the hand motions of 16 participants while reaching out to grasp and
then moving real and synthetic objects. Our results demonstrate that even a
simple LSTM network can predict the time point at which the user grasps an
object with a precision better than 21 ms and the current distance to this
object with a precision better than 1 cm. The target's size can be determined
in advance with an accuracy better than 97%. Our results have implications for
designing adaptive and fine-grained interactive user interfaces in ubiquitous

Motivation: 传统手工艺文档仅关注线性步骤，忽略了即兴和适应性的隐性知识，限制了知识传播。

Method: 结合HCI、CSCW和社会科学的文献及专家访谈，开发了一种记录即兴行为的基本语法，并通过CraftLink界面实现半自动文档生成。

Result: 用户研究（N=7）表明，该语法能有效捕捉和分享专家知识，支持协作知识库的构建。

Conclusion: 该研究为计算系统支持手工艺社区的知识共享提供了新途径。

Abstract: Craft practices rely on evolving archives of skill and knowledge, developed
through generations of craftspeople experimenting with designs, materials, and
techniques. Better documentation of these practices enables the sharing of
knowledge and expertise between sites and generations. However, most
documentation focuses solely on the linear steps leading to final artifacts,
neglecting the tacit knowledge necessary to improvise, or adapt workflows to
meet the unique demands of each craft project. This omission limits knowledge
sharing and reduces craft to a mechanical endeavor, rather than a sophisticated
way of seeing, thinking, and doing. Drawing on expert interviews and literature
from HCI, CSCW and the social sciences, we develop an elementary grammar to
document improvisational actions of real-world craft practices. We demonstrate
the utility of this grammar with an interface called CraftLink that can be used
to analyze expert videos and semi-automatically generate documentation to
convey material and contextual variations of craft practices. Our user study
with expert crocheters (N=7) using this interface evaluates our grammar's
effectiveness in capturing and sharing expert knowledge with other
craftspeople, offering new pathways for computational systems to support
collaborative archives of knowledge and practice within communities.

Method: 通过分析2020年以来的30项研究，总结了GAI应用的设计目标、形式和评估方法。

Result: GAI在故事讲述、情感技能训练等领域有潜力，但需关注文化偏见和可访问性等伦理问题。

Conclusion: GAI支持动态个性化互动，但需更公平的设计和包容性评估策略。

Abstract: Reduced social connectedness increasingly poses a threat to mental health,
life expectancy, and general well-being. Generative AI (GAI) technologies, such
as large language models (LLMs) and image generation tools, are increasingly
integrated into applications aimed at enhancing human social experiences.
Despite their growing presence, little is known about how these technologies
influence social interactions. This scoping review investigates how GAI-based
applications are currently designed to facilitate social interaction, what
forms of social engagement they target, and which design and evaluation
methodologies designers use to create and evaluate them. Through an analysis of
30 studies published since 2020, we identify key trends in application domains
including storytelling, socio-emotional skills training, reminiscence,
collaborative learning, music making, and general conversation. We highlight
the role of participatory and co-design approaches in fostering both effective
technology use and social engagement, while also examining socio-ethical
concerns such as cultural bias and accessibility. This review underscores the
potential of GAI to support dynamic and personalized interactions, but calls
for greater attention to equitable design practices and inclusive evaluation
strategies.

Conclusion: 未来需量化研究视觉特征对社交媒体视频交流的影响，以开发更支持患者的视频分享平台。

Abstract: Individuals with schizophrenia frequently experience intense emotions and
often turn to vlogging as a medium for emotional expression. While previous
research has predominantly focused on text based disclosure, little is known
about how individuals construct narratives around emotions and emotional
experiences in video blogs. Our study addresses this gap by analyzing 200
YouTube videos created by individuals with schizophrenia. Drawing on media
research and self presentation theories, we developed a visual analysis
framework to disentangle these videos. Our analysis revealed diverse practices
of emotion disclosure through both verbal and visual channels, highlighting the
dynamic interplay between these modes of expression. We found that the
deliberate construction of visual elements, including environmental settings
and specific aesthetic choices, appears to foster more supportive and engaged
viewer responses. These findings underscore the need for future large scale
quantitative research examining how visual features shape video mediated
communication on social media platforms. Such investigations would inform the
development of care centered video sharing platforms that better support
individuals managing illness experiences.

Abstract: Steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interfaces
(BCIs) can achieve high recognition accuracy with sufficient training data.
Transfer learning presents a promising solution to alleviate data requirements
for the target subject by leveraging data from source subjects; however,
effectively addressing individual variability among both target and source
subjects remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel transfer learning
framework, termed instance-based task-related component analysis (iTRCA), which
leverages knowledge from source subjects while considering their individual
contributions. iTRCA extracts two types of features: (1) the subject-general
feature, capturing shared information between source and target subjects in a
common latent space, and (2) the subject-specific feature, preserving the
unique characteristics of the target subject. To mitigate negative transfer, we
further design an enhanced framework, subject selection-based iTRCA (SS-iTRCA),
which integrates a similarity-based subject selection strategy to identify
appropriate source subjects for transfer based on their task-related components
(TRCs). Comparative evaluations on the Benchmark, BETA, and a self-collected
dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed iTRCA and SS-iTRCA
frameworks. This study provides a potential solution for developing
high-performance SSVEP-based BCIs with reduced target subject data.

Motivation: 传统MCIL方法仅关注视觉和文本，本文探索了视觉、音频和文本的多模态增量学习，以解决信息整合和灾难性遗忘的挑战。

Method: 1. 基于MoE的MIFE实现增量微调；2. AAVFM增强特征判别性和泛化性；3. 多模态对比训练损失优化跨模态对齐；4. 引入两种MCIL评估指标。

Result: 在三个多模态数据集上的实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法在多模态增量学习中表现出色，解决了信息整合和灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Unlike traditional Multimodal Class-Incremental Learning (MCIL) methods that
focus only on vision and text, this paper explores MCIL across vision, audio
and text modalities, addressing challenges in integrating complementary
information and mitigating catastrophic forgetting. To tackle these issues, we
propose an MCIL method based on multimodal pre-trained models. Firstly, a
Multimodal Incremental Feature Extractor (MIFE) based on Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) structure is introduced to achieve effective incremental fine-tuning for
AudioCLIP. Secondly, to enhance feature discriminability and generalization, we
propose an Adaptive Audio-Visual Fusion Module (AAVFM) that includes a masking
threshold mechanism and a dynamic feature fusion mechanism, along with a
strategy to enhance text diversity. Thirdly, a novel multimodal
class-incremental contrastive training loss is proposed to optimize cross-modal
alignment in MCIL. Finally, two MCIL-specific evaluation metrics are introduced
for comprehensive assessment. Extensive experiments on three multimodal
datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图神经网络依赖监督学习，自监督方法仍需微调，LLM在图任务中面临挑战。NOCL旨在克服这些限制，扩展LLM在图任务中的应用。

Method: NOCL采用节点描述（将节点属性转为自然语言）和节点概念（生成紧凑语义嵌入）技术，并结合图表示描述符统一任务格式。

Result: 实验显示NOCL在监督学习中与传统方法竞争，并在零样本场景中表现更优。

Conclusion: NOCL为图基础模型开辟了新方向，展示了LLM在图任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Graphs are essential for modeling complex interactions across domains such as
social networks, biology, and recommendation systems. Traditional Graph Neural
Networks, particularly Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), rely heavily on
supervised learning, limiting their generalization and applicability in
label-scarce scenarios. Recent self-supervised approaches still require labeled
fine-tuning, limiting their effectiveness in zero-shot scenarios. Meanwhile,
Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in natural language tasks but face
significant challenges when applied to graphs, including preserving reasoning
abilities, managing extensive token lengths from rich node attributes, and
being limited to textual-attributed graphs (TAGs) and a single level task. To
overcome these limitations, we propose the Node-Oriented Conceptualization LLM
(NOCL), a novel framework that leverages two core techniques: 1) node
description, which converts heterogeneous node attributes into structured
natural language, extending LLM from TAGs to non-TAGs; 2) node concept, which
encodes node descriptions into compact semantic embeddings using pretrained
language models, significantly reducing token lengths by up to 93.9% compared
to directly using node descriptions. Additionally, our NOCL employs graph
representation descriptors to unify graph tasks at various levels into a
shared, language-based query format, paving a new direction for Graph
Foundation Models. Experimental results validate NOCL's competitive supervised
performance relative to traditional MPNNs and hybrid LLM-MPNN methods and
demonstrate superior generalization in zero-shot settings.

Motivation: 传统逆向设计方法依赖大量数值模拟和优化，耗时且效率低，亟需更高效的方法。

Method: 采用串联神经网络（TNN），结合MLP、CNN和LSTM算法，解决逆向设计中的一对多映射问题。

Result: LSTM-LSTM-TNN精度最高但训练时间最长；CNN-LSTM-TNN在精度和速度上达到最优平衡。

Conclusion: CNN-LSTM-TNN是SiO2/TiO2多层薄膜逆向设计的最佳解决方案，兼具高效与准确性。

Abstract: Optical properties of thin film are greatly influenced by the thickness of
each layer. Accurately predicting these thicknesses and their corresponding
optical properties is important in the optical inverse design of thin films.
However, traditional inverse design methods usually demand extensive numerical
simulations and optimization procedures, which are time-consuming. In this
paper, we utilize deep learning for the inverse design of the transmission
spectra of SiO2/TiO2 multilayer thin films. We implement a tandem neural
network (TNN), which can solve the one-to-many mapping problem that greatly
degrades the performance of deep-learning-based inverse designs. In general,
the TNN has been implemented by a back-to-back connection of an inverse neural
network and a pre-trained forward neural network, both of which have been
implemented based on multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithms. In this paper, we
propose to use not only MLP, but also convolutional neural network (CNN) or
long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms in the configuration of the TNN. We
show that an LSTM-LSTM-based TNN yields the highest accuracy but takes the
longest training time among nine configurations of TNNs. We also find that a
CNN-LSTM-based TNN will be an optimal solution in terms of accuracy and speed
because it could integrate the strengths of the CNN and LSTM algorithms.

Motivation: 现有DPO方法忽视偏好对的固有质量和学习效用差异，导致数据利用和性能不佳。

Method: 提出Omni-DPO框架，联合考虑偏好对的固有质量和模型学习动态，自适应加权样本。

Result: 在文本理解和数学推理任务中，Omni-DPO显著优于基线方法，Gemma-2-9b-it在Arena-Hard上领先Claude 3 Opus 6.7分。

Conclusion: Omni-DPO通过优化数据利用和学习动态，展现出高效性和鲁棒性，代码和模型将开源。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a cornerstone of
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) due to its simplicity and
efficiency. However, existing DPO-based approaches typically treat all
preference pairs uniformly, ignoring critical variations in their inherent
quality and learning utility, leading to suboptimal data utilization and
performance. To address this challenge, we propose Omni-DPO, a dual-perspective
optimization framework that jointly accounts for (1) the inherent quality of
each preference pair and (2) the model's evolving performance on those pairs.
By adaptively weighting samples according to both data quality and the model's
learning dynamics during training, Omni-DPO enables more effective training
data utilization and achieves better performance. Experimental results on
various models and benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and generalization
capabilities of Omni-DPO. On textual understanding tasks, Gemma-2-9b-it
finetuned with Omni-DPO beats the leading LLM, Claude 3 Opus, by a significant
margin of 6.7 points on the Arena-Hard benchmark. On mathematical reasoning
tasks, Omni-DPO consistently outperforms the baseline methods across all
benchmarks, providing strong empirical evidence for the effectiveness and
robustness of our approach. Code and models will be available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于贝叶斯视角的方法，通过将提示视为统计模型中的文本参数，利用小规模训练数据进行贝叶斯推断，从而量化LLM的不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在不确定性量化方面仍存在挑战，限制了其在高风险领域的应用。此外，许多先进LLMs是闭源的，且对提示词敏感，需要大量手动调整。

Method: 将提示视为文本参数，利用贝叶斯推断进行不确定性量化，并提出了一种结合提示优化和MCMC的新算法MHLP。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在预测准确性和不确定性量化方面均有提升。

Conclusion: 该研究为将贝叶斯方法融入LLMs提供了可行路径，有助于构建更可靠和校准的LLM系统。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly capable of
solving challenging real-world tasks, accurately quantifying their uncertainty
remains a critical open problem, which limits their applicability in
high-stakes domains. This challenge is further compounded by the closed-source,
black-box nature of many state-of-the-art LLMs. Moreover, LLM-based systems can
be highly sensitive to the prompts that bind them together, which often require
significant manual tuning (i.e., prompt engineering). In this work, we address
these challenges by viewing LLM-based systems through a Bayesian lens. We
interpret prompts as textual parameters in a statistical model, allowing us to
use a small training dataset to perform Bayesian inference over these prompts.
This novel perspective enables principled uncertainty quantification over both
the model's textual parameters and its downstream predictions, while also
incorporating prior beliefs about these parameters expressed in free-form text.
To perform Bayesian inference, a difficult problem even for well-studied data
modalities, we introduce Metropolis-Hastings through LLM Proposals (MHLP), a
novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that combines prompt
optimization techniques with standard MCMC methods. MHLP is a turnkey
modification to existing LLM pipelines, including those that rely exclusively
on closed-source models. Empirically, we demonstrate that our method yields
improvements in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on
a range of LLM benchmarks and UQ tasks. More broadly, our work demonstrates a
viable path for incorporating methods from the rich Bayesian literature into
the era of LLMs, paving the way for more reliable and calibrated LLM-based
systems.

*Dane Williamson,Yangfeng Ji,Matthew Dwyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于信息理论的框架，优化分层变分自编码器（HVAEs）中潜在维度分配，以提高分布外（OOD）检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键应用中，OOD检测至关重要，但现有HVAEs的潜在维度分配方法效率低下或导致后验坍塌。

Method: 通过信息理论原则，形式化信息损失与表示衰减的权衡，提出最优潜在维度分配比例r*，并在固定潜在预算下验证其有效性。

Result: 实验表明，调整r*能显著提升OOD检测性能，优于基线HVAE配置。

Conclusion: 该框架为潜在结构设计提供了理论指导，增强了深度生成模型的OOD检测鲁棒性。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical task in machine learning,
particularly for safety-critical applications where unexpected inputs must be
reliably flagged. While hierarchical variational autoencoders (HVAEs) offer
improved representational capacity over traditional VAEs, their performance is
highly sensitive to how latent dimensions are distributed across layers.
Existing approaches often allocate latent capacity arbitrarily, leading to
ineffective representations or posterior collapse. In this work, we introduce a
theoretically grounded framework for optimizing latent dimension allocation in
HVAEs, drawing on principles from information theory to formalize the trade-off
between information loss and representational attenuation. We prove the
existence of an optimal allocation ratio $r^{\ast}$ under a fixed latent
budget, and empirically show that tuning this ratio consistently improves OOD
detection performance across datasets and architectures. Our approach
outperforms baseline HVAE configurations and provides practical guidance for
principled latent structure design, leading to more robust OOD detection with
deep generative models.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider a kernelized bandit problem with a compact arm set ${X} \subset
\mathbb{R}^d $ and a fixed but unknown reward function $f^*$ with a finite norm
in some Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). We propose a class of
computationally efficient kernelized bandit algorithms, which we call
GP-Generic, based on a novel concept: exploration distributions. This class of
algorithms includes Upper Confidence Bound-based approaches as a special case,
but also allows for a variety of randomized algorithms. With careful choice of
exploration distribution, our proposed generic algorithm realizes a wide range
of concrete algorithms that achieve $\tilde{O}(\gamma_T\sqrt{T})$ regret
bounds, where $\gamma_T$ characterizes the RKHS complexity. This matches known
results for UCB- and Thompson Sampling-based algorithms; we also show that in
practice, randomization can yield better practical results.

Motivation: 探索一种结合数据重建和聚类的方法，以实现更优的无监督图像聚类性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在数据重建精度和聚类纯度之间取得了平衡，为大规模图像聚类应用提供了可靠基础。

Abstract: This research implements an advanced unsupervised clustering system for MNIST
handwritten digits through two-phase deep autoencoder architecture. A deep
neural autoencoder requires a training process during phase one to develop
minimal yet interpretive representations of images by minimizing reconstruction
errors. During the second phase we unify the reconstruction error with a KMeans
clustering loss for learned latent embeddings through a joint distance-based
objective. Our model contains three elements which include batch normalization
combined with dropout and weight decay for achieving generalized and stable
results. The framework achieves superior clustering performance during
extensive tests which used intrinsic measurements including Silhouette Score
and Davies-Bouldin Index coupled with extrinsic metrics NMI and ARI when
processing image features. The research uses t-SNE visualization to present
learned embeddings that show distinct clusters for digits. Our approach reaches
an optimal combination between data reconstruction accuracy and cluster
separation purity when adding the benefit of understandable results and
scalable implementations. The approach creates a dependable base that helps
deploy unsupervised representation learning in different large-scale image
clustering applications.

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡了个性化学习与协作效率，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We present a novel federated multi-task learning method that leverages
cross-client similarity to enable personalized learning for each client. To
avoid transmitting the entire model to the parameter server, we propose a
communication-efficient scheme that introduces a feature anchor, a compact
vector representation that summarizes the features learned from the client's
local classes. This feature anchor is shared with the server to account for
local clients' distribution. In addition, the clients share the classification
heads, a lightweight linear layer, and perform a graph-based regularization to
enable collaboration among clients. By modeling collaboration between clients
as a dynamic graph and continuously updating and refining this graph, we can
account for any drift from the clients. To ensure beneficial knowledge transfer
and prevent negative collaboration, we leverage a community detection-based
approach that partitions this dynamic graph into homogeneous communities,
maximizing the sum of task similarities, represented as the graph edges'
weights, within each community. This mechanism restricts collaboration to
highly similar clients within their formed communities, ensuring positive
interaction and preserving personalization. Extensive experiments on two
heterogeneous datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we show that our method exhibits
superior computation and communication efficiency and promotes fairness across
clients.

Result: 生成的3D云符合物理趋势，专家难以区分其非物理性。

Conclusion: NnD是一种高效且物理可信的生成方法，适用于复杂非负对象的模拟。

Abstract: Most natural objects have inherent complexity and variability. While some
simple objects can be modeled from first principles, many real-world phenomena,
such as cloud formation, require computationally expensive simulations that
limit scalability. This work focuses on a class of physically meaningful,
nonnegative objects that are computationally tractable but costly to simulate.
To dramatically reduce computational costs, we propose nonnegative diffusion
(NnD). This is a learned generative model using score based diffusion. It
adapts annealed Langevin dynamics to enforce, by design, non-negativity
throughout iterative scene generation and analysis (inference). NnD trains on
high-quality physically simulated objects. Once trained, it can be used for
generation and inference. We demonstrate generation of 3D volumetric clouds,
comprising inherently nonnegative microphysical fields. Our generated clouds
are consistent with cloud physics trends. They are effectively not
distinguished as non-physical by expert perception.

Motivation: 现有图主动学习方法主要在静态图上评估，忽视了用户中心考量（如多样性、公平性）和动态环境适应性。

Method: 提出GRAIL框架，引入新指标评估持续有效性、多样性和用户负担，并在动态真实数据集上进行实验。

Result: 实验揭示了预测性能与用户负担之间的权衡，现有方法在动态环境中存在局限性。

Conclusion: GRAIL强调了平衡节点重要性、查询多样性和网络拓扑的重要性，为动态环境中的图主动学习提供了评估机制。

Abstract: Graph-based Active Learning (AL) leverages the structure of graphs to
efficiently prioritize label queries, reducing labeling costs and user burden
in applications like health monitoring, human behavior analysis, and sensor
networks. By identifying strategically positioned nodes, graph AL minimizes
data collection demands while maintaining model performance, making it a
valuable tool for dynamic environments. Despite its potential, existing graph
AL methods are often evaluated on static graph datasets and primarily focus on
prediction accuracy, neglecting user-centric considerations such as sampling
diversity, query fairness, and adaptability to dynamic settings. To bridge this
gap, we introduce GRAIL, a novel benchmarking framework designed to evaluate
graph AL strategies in dynamic, real-world environments. GRAIL introduces novel
metrics to assess sustained effectiveness, diversity, and user burden, enabling
a comprehensive evaluation of AL methods under varying conditions. Extensive
experiments on datasets featuring dynamic, real-life human sensor data reveal
trade-offs between prediction performance and user burden, highlighting
limitations in existing AL strategies. GRAIL demonstrates the importance of
balancing node importance, query diversity, and network topology, providing an
evaluation mechanism for graph AL solutions in dynamic environments.

Conclusion: A-CAPELLA算法为未知臂容量的去中心化无感知MMAB问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We study the decentralized multi-player multi-armed bandits (MMAB) problem
under a no-sensing setting, where each player receives only their own reward
and obtains no information about collisions. Each arm has an unknown capacity,
and if the number of players pulling an arm exceeds its capacity, all players
involved receive zero reward. This setting generalizes the classical
unit-capacity model and introduces new challenges in coordination and capacity
discovery under severe feedback limitations. We propose A-CAPELLA (Algorithm
for Capacity-Aware Parallel Elimination for Learning and Allocation), a
decentralized algorithm that achieves logarithmic regret in this generalized
regime. Our main contribution is a collaborative hypothesis testing protocol
that enables synchronized successive elimination and capacity estimation
through carefully structured collision patterns. This represents a provably
efficient learning result in decentralized no-sensing MMAB with unknown arm
capacities.

Method: 将ODR形式化为参数化模拟器家族的最大似然估计，证明其一致性及误差界限，并提出E-DROPO算法加入熵奖励以防止方差崩溃。

Result: 理论证明ODR的模拟到现实误差比均匀DR更紧，E-DROPO在实践中实现了更鲁棒的零样本迁移。

Conclusion: ODR为模拟到现实迁移提供了理论支持，E-DROPO进一步提升了性能，为实际应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement-learning agents often struggle when deployed from simulation to
the real-world. A dominant strategy for reducing the sim-to-real gap is domain
randomization (DR) which trains the policy across many simulators produced by
sampling dynamics parameters, but standard DR ignores offline data already
available from the real system. We study offline domain randomization (ODR),
which first fits a distribution over simulator parameters to an offline
dataset. While a growing body of empirical work reports substantial gains with
algorithms such as DROPO, the theoretical foundations of ODR remain largely
unexplored. In this work, we (i) formalize ODR as a maximum-likelihood
estimation over a parametric simulator family, (ii) prove consistency of this
estimator under mild regularity and identifiability conditions, showing it
converges to the true dynamics as the dataset grows, (iii) derive gap bounds
demonstrating ODRs sim-to-real error is up to an O(M) factor tighter than
uniform DR in the finite-simulator case (and analogous gains in the continuous
setting), and (iv) introduce E-DROPO, a new version of DROPO which adds an
entropy bonus to prevent variance collapse, yielding broader randomization and
more robust zero-shot transfer in practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标条件行为克隆（GCBC）在训练任务上表现良好，但在需要组合泛化的新任务中表现不佳，部分原因是状态表示缺乏时序一致性。

Method: 提出BYOL-γ增强GCBC，通过一种简单的表示学习目标，无需对比样本或TD学习，即可近似后继表示。

Result: 该方法在需要组合泛化的挑战性任务中表现出竞争力。

Conclusion: BYOL-γ增强GCBC通过改进时序一致性，有效提升了GCBC的组合泛化能力。

Abstract: Behavioral cloning (BC) methods trained with supervised learning (SL) are an
effective way to learn policies from human demonstrations in domains like
robotics. Goal-conditioning these policies enables a single generalist policy
to capture diverse behaviors contained within an offline dataset. While
goal-conditioned behavior cloning (GCBC) methods can perform well on
in-distribution training tasks, they do not necessarily generalize zero-shot to
tasks that require conditioning on novel state-goal pairs, i.e. combinatorial
generalization. In part, this limitation can be attributed to a lack of
temporal consistency in the state representation learned by BC; if temporally
related states are encoded to similar latent representations, then the
out-of-distribution gap for novel state-goal pairs would be reduced. Hence,
encouraging this temporal consistency in the representation space should
facilitate combinatorial generalization. Successor representations, which
encode the distribution of future states visited from the current state, nicely
encapsulate this property. However, previous methods for learning successor
representations have relied on contrastive samples, temporal-difference (TD)
learning, or both. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective
representation learning objective, $\text{BYOL-}\gamma$ augmented GCBC, which
is not only able to theoretically approximate the successor representation in
the finite MDP case without contrastive samples or TD learning, but also,
results in competitive empirical performance across a suite of challenging
tasks requiring combinatorial generalization.

Abstract: We partially reverse-engineer a convolutional recurrent neural network (RNN)
trained to play the puzzle game Sokoban with model-free reinforcement learning.
Prior work found that this network solves more levels with more test-time
compute. Our analysis reveals several mechanisms analogous to components of
classic bidirectional search. For each square, the RNN represents its plan in
the activations of channels associated with specific directions. These
state-action activations are analogous to a value function - their magnitudes
determine when to backtrack and which plan branch survives pruning. Specialized
kernels extend these activations (containing plan and value) forward and
backward to create paths, forming a transition model. The algorithm is also
unlike classical search in some ways. State representation is not unified;
instead, the network considers each box separately. Each layer has its own plan
representation and value function, increasing search depth. Far from being
inscrutable, the mechanisms leveraging test-time compute learned in this
network by model-free training can be understood in familiar terms.

Abstract: Deep off-policy actor-critic algorithms have emerged as the leading framework
for reinforcement learning in continuous control domains. However, most of
these algorithms suffer from poor sample efficiency, especially in environments
with sparse rewards. In this paper, we take a step towards addressing this
issue by providing a principled directed exploration strategy. We propose
Wasserstein Barycenter Soft Actor-Critic (WBSAC) algorithm, which benefits from
a pessimistic actor for temporal difference learning and an optimistic actor to
promote exploration. This is achieved by using the Wasserstein barycenter of
the pessimistic and optimistic policies as the exploration policy and adjusting
the degree of exploration throughout the learning process. We compare WBSAC
with state-of-the-art off-policy actor-critic algorithms and show that WBSAC is
more sample-efficient on MuJoCo continuous control tasks.

Motivation: 传统非参数方法（如Beran估计器）在处理复杂数据结构和严重截尾时表现不佳，因此需要更高效的生存分析模型。

Result: 实验表明，新模型（尤其是iSurvJ）在准确性和计算复杂度上均优于Beran估计器。

Abstract: Survival analysis is a fundamental tool for modeling time-to-event data in
healthcare, engineering, and finance, where censored observations pose
significant challenges. While traditional methods like the Beran estimator
offer nonparametric solutions, they often struggle with the complex data
structures and heavy censoring. This paper introduces three novel survival
models, iSurvM (the imprecise Survival model based on Mean likelihood
functions), iSurvQ (the imprecise Survival model based on the Quantiles of
likelihood functions), and iSurvJ (the imprecise Survival model based on the
Joint learning), that combine imprecise probability theory with attention
mechanisms to handle censored data without parametric assumptions. The first
idea behind the models is to represent censored observations by interval-valued
probability distributions for each instance over time intervals between events
moments. The second idea is to employ the kernel-based Nadaraya-Watson
regression with trainable attention weights for computing the imprecise
probability distribution over time intervals for the entire dataset. The third
idea is to consider three decision strategies for training, which correspond to
the proposed three models. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets
demonstrate that the proposed models, especially iSurvJ, consistently
outperform the Beran estimator from the accuracy and computational complexity
points of view. Codes implementing the proposed models are publicly available.

Abstract: Heart failure (HF) poses a significant global health challenge, with early
detection offering opportunities for improved outcomes. Abnormalities in heart
rate (HR), particularly during daily activities, may serve as early indicators
of HF risk. However, existing HR monitoring tools for HF detection are limited
by their reliability on population-based averages. The estimation of
individualized HR serves as a dynamic digital twin, enabling precise tracking
of cardiac health biomarkers. Current HR estimation methods, categorized into
physiologically-driven and purely data-driven models, struggle with efficiency
and interpretability. This study introduces a novel physiological-model-based
neural network (PMB-NN) framework for HR estimation based on oxygen uptake
(VO2) data during daily physical activities. The framework was trained and
tested on individual datasets from 12 participants engaged in activities
including resting, cycling, and running. By embedding physiological
constraints, which were derived from our proposed simplified human movement
physiological model (PM), into the neural network training process, the PMB-NN
model adheres to human physiological principles while achieving high estimation
accuracy, with a median R$^2$ score of 0.8 and an RMSE of 8.3 bpm. Comparative
statistical analysis demonstrates that the PMB-NN achieves performance on par
with the benchmark neural network model while significantly outperforming
traditional physiological model (p=0.002). In addition, our PMB-NN is adept at
identifying personalized parameters of the PM, enabling the PM to generate
reasonable HR estimation. The proposed framework with a precise VO2 estimation
system derived from body movements enables the future possibilities of
personalized and real-time cardiac monitoring during daily life physical
activities.

*Tejaswi Kasarla,Max van Spengler,Pascal Mettes*

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于双曲嵌入的方法（Balanced Hyperbolic Learning），用于区分分布内和分布外样本，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习中的分布外识别问题，提升样本分类的准确性。

Method: 引入平衡双曲学习，通过优化层次失真和子层次平衡，生成双曲类嵌入作为分类原型。

Result: 在13个数据集和13种评分函数上，双曲嵌入方法优于现有方法，且支持层次化分布外泛化。

Conclusion: 双曲嵌入是区分分布内外样本的有效方法，性能优于其他方法。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution recognition forms an important and well-studied problem
in deep learning, with the goal to filter out samples that do not belong to the
distribution on which a network has been trained. The conclusion of this paper
is simple: a good hierarchical hyperbolic embedding is preferred for
discriminating in- and out-of-distribution samples. We introduce Balanced
Hyperbolic Learning. We outline a hyperbolic class embedding algorithm that
jointly optimizes for hierarchical distortion and balancing between shallow and
wide subhierarchies. We then use the class embeddings as hyperbolic prototypes
for classification on in-distribution data. We outline how to generalize
existing out-of-distribution scoring functions to operate with hyperbolic
prototypes. Empirical evaluations across 13 datasets and 13 scoring functions
show that our hyperbolic embeddings outperform existing out-of-distribution
approaches when trained on the same data with the same backbones. We also show
that our hyperbolic embeddings outperform other hyperbolic approaches, beat
state-of-the-art contrastive methods, and natively enable hierarchical
out-of-distribution generalization.

*Minoh Jeong,Seonho Kim,Alfred Hero*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种变分对比学习（VCL）框架，通过引入概率嵌入和KL散度正则化，解决了确定性对比学习方法缺乏不确定性量化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确定性对比学习方法（如SimCLR和SupCon）缺乏不确定性量化机制，限制了其应用范围。

Method: VCL通过最大化证据下界（ELBO），将InfoNCE损失作为重构项的替代，并添加KL散度正则化，建模后验分布为投影正态分布。

Result: 实验表明，VCL缓解了维度坍缩，增强了与类标签的互信息，分类准确率与基线相当或更高，同时提供了有意义的后验不确定性估计。

Conclusion: VCL为对比学习提供了概率基础，成为对比方法的新基准。

Abstract: Deterministic embeddings learned by contrastive learning (CL) methods such as
SimCLR and SupCon achieve state-of-the-art performance but lack a principled
mechanism for uncertainty quantification. We propose Variational Contrastive
Learning (VCL), a decoder-free framework that maximizes the evidence lower
bound (ELBO) by interpreting the InfoNCE loss as a surrogate reconstruction
term and adding a KL divergence regularizer to a uniform prior on the unit
hypersphere. We model the approximate posterior $q_\theta(z|x)$ as a projected
normal distribution, enabling the sampling of probabilistic embeddings. Our two
instantiations--VSimCLR and VSupCon--replace deterministic embeddings with
samples from $q_\theta(z|x)$ and incorporate a normalized KL term into the
loss. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VCL mitigates
dimensional collapse, enhances mutual information with class labels, and
matches or outperforms deterministic baselines in classification accuracy, all
the while providing meaningful uncertainty estimates through the posterior
model. VCL thus equips contrastive learning with a probabilistic foundation,
serving as a new basis for contrastive approaches.

Conclusion: KANs 在现代工业系统识别中具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are emerging as a powerful framework for
interpretable and efficient system identification in dynamic systems. By
leveraging the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, KANs enable function
approximation through learnable activation functions, offering improved
scalability, accuracy, and interpretability compared to traditional neural
networks. This paper investigates the application of KANs to model and analyze
the dynamics of a buck converter system, focusing on state-space parameter
estimation along with discovering the system equations. Using simulation data,
the methodology involves approximating state derivatives with KANs,
constructing interpretable state-space representations, and validating these
models through numerical experiments. The results demonstrate the ability of
KANs to accurately identify system dynamics, verify model consistency, and
detect parameter changes, providing valuable insights into their applicability
for system identification in modern industrial systems.

Conclusion: 发现的轨迹规律性为优化采样策略提供了新思路，动态规划方法简单高效且性能优越。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models employ stochastic differential equations
(SDEs) and their equivalent probability flow ordinary differential equations
(ODEs) to establish a smooth transformation between complex high-dimensional
data distributions and tractable prior distributions. In this paper, we reveal
a striking geometric regularity in the deterministic sampling dynamics: each
simulated sampling trajectory lies within an extremely low-dimensional
subspace, and all trajectories exhibit an almost identical ''boomerang'' shape,
regardless of the model architecture, applied conditions, or generated content.
We characterize several intriguing properties of these trajectories,
particularly under closed-form solutions based on kernel-estimated data
modeling. We also demonstrate a practical application of the discovered
trajectory regularity by proposing a dynamic programming-based scheme to better
align the sampling time schedule with the underlying trajectory structure. This
simple strategy requires minimal modification to existing ODE-based numerical
solvers, incurs negligible computational overhead, and achieves superior image
generation performance, especially in regions with only $5 \sim 10$ function
evaluations.

Abstract: Equivariant diffusion models have achieved impressive performance in 3D
molecule generation. These models incorporate Euclidean symmetries of 3D
molecules by utilizing an SE(3)-equivariant denoising network. However,
specialized equivariant architectures limit the scalability and efficiency of
diffusion models. In this paper, we propose an approach that relaxes such
equivariance constraints. Specifically, our approach learns a sample-dependent
SO(3) transformation for each molecule to construct an aligned latent space. A
non-equivariant diffusion model is then trained over the aligned
representations. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach performs
significantly better than previously reported non-equivariant models. It yields
sample quality comparable to state-of-the-art equivariant diffusion models and
offers improved training and sampling efficiency. Our code is available at

TL;DR: DynaSubVAE是一种动态子群变分自编码器框架，通过联合表示学习和自适应OOD检测，动态更新潜在结构以捕捉新趋势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实观测数据中常存在偏离全局模式的异质子群，现有模型往往忽视这些群体，导致预测不准确甚至有害。

Method: DynaSubVAE利用非参数聚类机制（受高斯混合模型启发）发现和建模潜在子群，动态更新潜在结构。

Result: 实验表明，DynaSubVAE在近OOD和远OOD检测中表现优异，尤其在训练中缺失整个类别的场景下。

Conclusion: DynaSubVAE的动态子群机制在OOD准确性和后悔精度上优于独立聚类方法。

Abstract: Real-world observational data often contain existing or emerging
heterogeneous subpopulations that deviate from global patterns. The majority of
models tend to overlook these underrepresented groups, leading to inaccurate or
even harmful predictions. Existing solutions often rely on detecting these
samples as Out-of-domain (OOD) rather than adapting the model to new emerging
patterns. We introduce DynaSubVAE, a Dynamic Subgrouping Variational
Autoencoder framework that jointly performs representation learning and
adaptive OOD detection. Unlike conventional approaches, DynaSubVAE evolves with
the data by dynamically updating its latent structure to capture new trends. It
leverages a novel non-parametric clustering mechanism, inspired by Gaussian
Mixture Models, to discover and model latent subgroups based on embedding
similarity. Extensive experiments show that DynaSubVAE achieves competitive
performance in both near-OOD and far-OOD detection, and excels in class-OOD
scenarios where an entire class is missing during training. We further
illustrate that our dynamic subgrouping mechanism outperforms standalone
clustering methods such as GMM and KMeans++ in terms of both OOD accuracy and
regret precision.

Method: 使用EPHNOGRAM数据集，结合线性和非线性机器学习模型（如非因果LSTM），分析ECG和PCG的相互重建能力及影响因素。

Result: 非线性模型（尤其是非因果LSTM）在重建中表现最佳，PCG到ECG的重建更易实现；跨受试者和运动场景具有挑战性，但基于包络的建模提高了泛化能力。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了ECG和PCG的波形和时序关系，为新型多模态心脏监测技术提供了潜在应用。

Abstract: Simultaneous electrocardiography (ECG) and phonocardiogram (PCG) provide a
comprehensive, multimodal perspective on cardiac function by capturing the
heart's electrical and mechanical activities, respectively. However, the
distinct and overlapping information content of these signals, as well as their
potential for mutual reconstruction and biomarker extraction, remains
incompletely understood, especially under varying physiological conditions and
across individuals.
  In this study, we systematically investigate the common and exclusive
characteristics of ECG and PCG using the EPHNOGRAM dataset of simultaneous
ECG-PCG recordings during rest and exercise. We employ a suite of linear and
nonlinear machine learning models, including non-causal LSTM networks, to
reconstruct each modality from the other and analyze the influence of
causality, physiological state, and cross-subject variability. Our results
demonstrate that nonlinear models, particularly non-causal LSTM, provide
superior reconstruction performance, with reconstructing ECG from PCG proving
more tractable than the reverse. Exercise and cross-subject scenarios present
significant challenges, but envelope-based modeling that utilizes instantaneous
amplitude features substantially improves cross-subject generalizability for
cross-modal learning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that clinically relevant ECG
biomarkers, such as fiducial points and QT intervals, can be estimated from PCG
in cross-subject settings.
  These findings advance our understanding of the relationship between
electromechanical cardiac modalities, in terms of both waveform characteristics
and the timing of cardiac events, with potential applications in novel
multimodal cardiac monitoring technologies.

Conclusion: LaMAGIC2为模拟拓扑生成提供了更高效的框架，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Automation of analog topology design is crucial due to customized
requirements of modern applications with heavily manual engineering efforts.
The state-of-the-art work applies a sequence-to-sequence approach and
supervised finetuning on language models to generate topologies given user
specifications. However, its circuit formulation is inefficient due to O(|V |2)
token length and suffers from low precision sensitivity to numeric inputs. In
this work, we introduce LaMAGIC2, a succinct float-input canonical formulation
with identifier (SFCI) for language model-based analog topology generation.
SFCI addresses these challenges by improving component-type recognition through
identifier-based representations, reducing token length complexity to O(|V |),
and enhancing numeric precision sensitivity for better performance under tight
tolerances. Our experiments demonstrate that LaMAGIC2 achieves 34% higher
success rates under a tight tolerance of 0.01 and 10X lower MSEs compared to a
prior method. LaMAGIC2 also exhibits better transferability for circuits with
more vertices with up to 58.5% improvement. These advancements establish
LaMAGIC2 as a robust framework for analog topology generation.

Conclusion: DC-Clustering填补了联邦学习研究的空白，具有隐私保护、通信高效和灵活性等优势。

Abstract: In recent years, the growing need to leverage sensitive data across
institutions has led to increased attention on federated learning (FL), a
decentralized machine learning paradigm that enables model training without
sharing raw data. However, existing FL-based clustering methods, known as
federated clustering, typically assume simple data partitioning scenarios such
as horizontal or vertical splits, and cannot handle more complex distributed
structures. This study proposes data collaboration clustering (DC-Clustering),
a novel federated clustering method that supports clustering over complex data
partitioning scenarios where horizontal and vertical splits coexist. In
DC-Clustering, each institution shares only intermediate representations
instead of raw data, ensuring privacy preservation while enabling collaborative
clustering. The method allows flexible selection between k-means and spectral
clustering, and achieves final results with a single round of communication
with the central server. We conducted extensive experiments using synthetic and
open benchmark datasets. The results show that our method achieves clustering
performance comparable to centralized clustering where all data are pooled.
DC-Clustering addresses an important gap in current FL research by enabling
effective knowledge discovery from distributed heterogeneous data. Its
practical properties -- privacy preservation, communication efficiency, and
flexibility -- make it a promising tool for privacy-sensitive domains such as
healthcare and finance.

Abstract: We propose a meta-learning method for learning from multiple noisy
annotators. In many applications such as crowdsourcing services, labels for
supervised learning are given by multiple annotators. Since the annotators have
different skills or biases, given labels can be noisy. To learn accurate
classifiers, existing methods require many noisy annotated data. However,
sufficient data might be unavailable in practice. To overcome the lack of data,
the proposed method uses labeled data obtained in different but related tasks.
The proposed method embeds each example in tasks to a latent space by using a
neural network and constructs a probabilistic model for learning a
task-specific classifier while estimating annotators' abilities on the latent
space. This neural network is meta-learned to improve the expected test
classification performance when the classifier is adapted to a given small
amount of annotated data. This classifier adaptation is performed by maximizing
the posterior probability via the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.
Since each step in the EM algorithm is easily computed as a closed-form and is
differentiable, the proposed method can efficiently backpropagate the loss
through the EM algorithm to meta-learn the neural network. We show the
effectiveness of our method with real-world datasets with synthetic noise and
real-world crowdsourcing datasets.

Conclusion: 揭示了传统约束的不合理性，提供了改进SDP验证的实用方案，推动更可靠的DNN系统发展。

Abstract: Semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation has emerged as a promising approach
for neural network verification, offering tighter bounds than other convex
relaxation methods for deep neural networks (DNNs) with ReLU activations.
However, we identify a critical limitation in the SDP relaxation when applied
to deep networks: interior-point vanishing, which leads to the loss of strict
feasibility -- a crucial condition for the numerical stability and optimality
of SDP. Through rigorous theoretical and empirical analysis, we demonstrate
that as the depth of DNNs increases, the strict feasibility is likely to be
lost, creating a fundamental barrier to scaling SDP-based verification. To
address the interior-point vanishing, we design and investigate five solutions
to enhance the feasibility conditions of the verification problem. Our methods
can successfully solve 88% of the problems that could not be solved by existing
methods, accounting for 41% of the total. Our analysis also reveals that the
valid constraints for the lower and upper bounds for each ReLU unit are
traditionally inherited from prior work without solid reasons, but are actually
not only unbeneficial but also even harmful to the problem's feasibility. This
work provides valuable insights into the fundamental challenges of SDP-based
DNN verification and offers practical solutions to improve its applicability to
deeper neural networks, contributing to the development of more reliable and
secure systems with DNNs.

capabilities in representing and understanding diverse modalities. However,
they typically focus on modality alignment in a pairwise manner while
overlooking structural relationships across data points. Integrating
multimodality with structured graph information (i.e., multimodal graphs, MMGs)
is essential for real-world applications such as social networks, healthcare,
and recommendation systems. Existing MMG learning methods fall into three
paradigms based on how they leverage MLLMs: Encoder, Aligner, and Predictor.
MLLM-as-Encoder focuses on enhancing graph neural networks (GNNs) via
multimodal feature fusion; MLLM-as-Aligner aligns multimodal attributes in
language or hidden space to enable LLM-based graph reasoning; MLLM-as-Predictor
treats MLLMs as standalone reasoners with in-context learning or fine-tuning.
Despite their advances, the MMG field lacks a unified benchmark to fairly
evaluate across these approaches, making it unclear what progress has been
made. To bridge this gap, we present Graph-MLLM, a comprehensive benchmark for
multimodal graph learning by systematically evaluating these three paradigms
across six datasets with different domains. Through extensive experiments, we
observe that jointly considering the visual and textual attributes of the nodes
benefits graph learning, even when using pre-trained text-to-image alignment
models (e.g., CLIP) as encoders. We also find that converting visual attributes
into textual descriptions further improves performance compared to directly
using visual inputs. Moreover, we observe that fine-tuning MLLMs on specific
MMGs can achieve state-of-the-art results in most scenarios, even without
explicit graph structure information. We hope that our open-sourced library
will facilitate rapid, equitable evaluation and inspire further innovative
research in this field.

Result: Col-UCB实现了最优的极小极大和实例依赖协作遗憾，适应组间共享动作集的结构。

Conclusion: 协作在特定结构下比独立学习更具优势，Col-UCB算法有效平衡了探索负担。

Abstract: We study the impact of sharing exploration in multi-armed bandits in a
grouped setting where a set of groups have overlapping feasible action sets
[Baek and Farias '24]. In this grouped bandit setting, groups share reward
observations, and the objective is to minimize the collaborative regret,
defined as the maximum regret across groups. This naturally captures
applications in which one aims to balance the exploration burden between groups
or populations -- it is known that standard algorithms can lead to
significantly imbalanced exploration cost between groups. We address this
problem by introducing an algorithm Col-UCB that dynamically coordinates
exploration across groups. We show that Col-UCB achieves both optimal minimax
and instance-dependent collaborative regret up to logarithmic factors. These
bounds are adaptive to the structure of shared action sets between groups,
providing insights into when collaboration yields significant benefits over
each group learning their best action independently.

Result: 元学习方法显著提高了预测精度，优于预训练模型。

Conclusion: 该方法在开放编辑平台上对抗马甲行为方面取得了进展，并发布了新数据集以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Malicious sockpuppet detection on Wikipedia is critical to preserving access
to reliable information on the internet and preventing the spread of
disinformation. Prior machine learning approaches rely on stylistic and
meta-data features, but do not prioritise adaptability to author-specific
behaviours. As a result, they struggle to effectively model the behaviour of
specific sockpuppet-groups, especially when text data is limited. To address
this, we propose the application of meta-learning, a machine learning technique
designed to improve performance in data-scarce settings by training models
across multiple tasks. Meta-learning optimises a model for rapid adaptation to
the writing style of a new sockpuppet-group. Our results show that
meta-learning significantly enhances the precision of predictions compared to
pre-trained models, marking an advancement in combating sockpuppetry on open
editing platforms. We release a new dataset of sockpuppet investigations to
foster future research in both sockpuppetry and meta-learning fields.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PyLO是一个基于PyTorch的库，旨在将学习优化器推广到更广泛的机器学习社区，提供用户友好的工具和性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习优化器（如VeLO）因依赖JAX和缺乏用户友好包而难以普及，PyLO旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过PyTorch实现学习优化器，支持CUDA加速，并结合现有优化工具（如学习率调度和权重衰减）。

Result: PyLO显著提升了训练速度（如ViT B/16训练速度从39.36提高到205.59样本/秒），并证明学习优化器与现有工具结合效果更佳。

Conclusion: PyLO为学习优化器的实际应用提供了便捷途径，展示了其在真实任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Learned optimizers have been an active research topic over the past decade,
with increasing progress toward practical, general-purpose optimizers that can
serve as drop-in replacements for widely used methods like Adam. However,
recent advances -- such as VeLO, which was meta-trained for 4000 TPU-months --
remain largely inaccessible to the broader community, in part due to their
reliance on JAX and the absence of user-friendly packages for applying the
optimizers after meta-training. To address this gap, we introduce PyLO, a
PyTorch-based library that brings learned optimizers to the broader machine
learning community through familiar, widely adopted workflows. Unlike prior
work focused on synthetic or convex tasks, our emphasis is on applying learned
optimization to real-world large-scale pre-training tasks. Our release includes
a CUDA-accelerated version of the small_fc_lopt learned optimizer architecture
from (Metz et al., 2022a), delivering substantial speedups -- from 39.36 to
205.59 samples/sec throughput for training ViT B/16 with batch size 32. PyLO
also allows us to easily combine learned optimizers with existing optimization
tools such as learning rate schedules and weight decay. When doing so, we find
that learned optimizers can substantially benefit. Our code is available at

Result: 在未见过的坐标上，MSE误差降低79%，并发现AQI的短期重复模式和空间关系变化。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了AQI预测精度，揭示了新的空气质量模式，代码已开源。

Abstract: Air pollution has become a significant health risk in developing countries.
While governments routinely publish air-quality index (AQI) data to track
pollution, these values fail to capture the local reality, as sensors are often
very sparse. In this paper, we address this gap by predicting AQI in 1 km^2
neighborhoods, using the example of AirDelhi dataset. Using Spatio-temporal
GNNs we surpass existing works by 71.654 MSE a 79% reduction, even on unseen
coordinates. New insights about AQI such as the existence of strong repetitive
short-term patterns and changing spatial relations are also discovered. The
code is available on GitHub.

Result: 理论证明HELiX能高效解决LLF问题，实验验证其优于反复提示LLM的方法。

Conclusion: 本文为基于通用语言反馈的交互学习算法设计提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Interactively learning from observation and language feedback is an
increasingly studied area driven by the emergence of large language model (LLM)
agents. While impressive empirical demonstrations have been shown, so far a
principled framing of these decision problems remains lacking. In this paper,
we formalize the Learning from Language Feedback (LLF) problem, assert
sufficient assumptions to enable learning despite latent rewards, and introduce
$\textit{transfer eluder dimension}$ as a complexity measure to characterize
the hardness of LLF problems. We show that transfer eluder dimension captures
the intuition that information in the feedback changes the learning complexity
of the LLF problem. We demonstrate cases where learning from rich language
feedback can be exponentially faster than learning from reward. We develop a
no-regret algorithm, called $\texttt{HELiX}$, that provably solves LLF problems
through sequential interactions, with performance guarantees that scale with
the transfer eluder dimension of the problem. Across several empirical domains,
we show that $\texttt{HELiX}$ performs well even when repeatedly prompting LLMs
does not work reliably. Our contributions mark a first step towards designing
principled interactive learning algorithms from generic language feedback.

Motivation: 生理信号常受运动伪影、基线漂移和低信噪比干扰，且具有非平稳性和急剧变化，传统方法难以处理。

Method: 采用小波分析方法捕捉多尺度时频特征，构建了针对EMG和ECG的预训练模型，并设计了统一的多模态框架。

Result: 在EMG和ECG任务中表现优异，多模态框架在低信噪比、高个体差异和设备不匹配等问题上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为生理信号分析奠定了基础，多模态设计对可穿戴健康监测和临床诊断具有潜在影响。

Abstract: Physiological signals are often corrupted by motion artifacts, baseline
drift, and other low-SNR disturbances, which pose significant challenges for
analysis. Additionally, these signals exhibit strong non-stationarity, with
sharp peaks and abrupt changes that evolve continuously, making them difficult
to represent using traditional time-domain or filtering methods. To address
these issues, a novel wavelet-based approach for physiological signal analysis
is presented, aiming to capture multi-scale time-frequency features in various
physiological signals. Leveraging this technique, two large-scale pretrained
models specific to EMG and ECG are introduced for the first time, achieving
superior performance and setting new baselines in downstream tasks.
Additionally, a unified multi-modal framework is constructed by integrating
pretrained EEG model, where each modality is guided through its dedicated
branch and fused via learnable weighted fusion. This design effectively
addresses challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratio, high inter-subject
variability, and device mismatch, outperforming existing methods on multi-modal
tasks. The proposed wavelet-based architecture lays a solid foundation for
analysis of diverse physiological signals, while the multi-modal design points
to next-generation physiological signal processing with potential impact on
wearable health monitoring, clinical diagnostics, and broader biomedical
applications.

Motivation: 传统RNN模型在模拟路径依赖性材料时存在自一致性和初始状态敏感性问题，限制了其在实际应用中的表现。

Method: 开发了HANO模型，结合傅里叶神经算子和分层自注意力机制，实现离散不变学习和多尺度特征提取。

Result: HANO在弹塑性和脆性固体损伤等基准问题上表现优于基线模型，具有更高的预测精度和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: HANO为模拟非弹性材料提供了高效的数据驱动替代方案，适合与传统数值求解器集成。

Abstract: This study presents an end-to-end learning framework for data-driven modeling
of path-dependent inelastic materials using neural operators. The framework is
built on the premise that irreversible evolution of material responses,
governed by hidden dynamics, can be inferred from observable data.
  We develop the History-Aware Neural Operator (HANO), an autoregressive model
that predicts path-dependent material responses from short segments of recent
strain-stress history without relying on hidden state variables, thereby
overcoming self-consistency issues commonly encountered in recurrent neural
network (RNN)-based models. Built on a Fourier-based neural operator backbone,
HANO enables discretization-invariant learning. To enhance its ability to
capture both global loading patterns and critical local path dependencies, we
embed a hierarchical self-attention mechanism that facilitates multiscale
feature extraction.
  Beyond ensuring self-consistency, HANO mitigates sensitivity to initial
hidden states, a commonly overlooked issue that can lead to instability in
recurrent models when applied to generalized loading paths. By modeling
stress-strain evolution as a continuous operator rather than relying on fixed
input-output mappings, HANO naturally accommodates varying path discretizations
and exhibits robust performance under complex conditions, including irregular
sampling, multi-cycle loading, noisy data, and pre-stressed states. We evaluate
HANO on two benchmark problems: elastoplasticity with hardening and progressive
anisotropic damage in brittle solids. Results show that HANO consistently
outperforms baseline models in predictive accuracy, generalization, and
robustness. With its demonstrated capabilities, HANO provides an effective
data-driven surrogate for simulating inelastic materials and is well-suited for
integration with classical numerical solvers.

TL;DR: TreeLoRA提出了一种基于层次梯度相似性的低秩适配器方法，用于高效持续学习，特别适用于大型预训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在流式数据环境中，持续学习需要高效更新模型以适应新任务，同时避免灾难性遗忘。大型预训练模型的高计算需求使得效率问题尤为关键。

Method: 通过层次梯度相似性构建层间适配器，利用Bandit技术和稀疏梯度更新优化任务相似性估计和参数优化。

Result: 在视觉Transformer和大型语言模型上的实验验证了方法的有效性和高效性。

Conclusion: TreeLoRA为大型预训练模型的持续学习提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Many real-world applications collect data in a streaming environment, where
learning tasks are encountered sequentially. This necessitates continual
learning (CL) to update models online, enabling adaptation to new tasks while
preserving past knowledge to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Nowadays, with
the flourish of large pre-trained models (LPMs), efficiency has become
increasingly critical for CL, due to their substantial computational demands
and growing parameter sizes. In this paper, we introduce TreeLoRA (K-D Tree of
Low-Rank Adapters), a novel approach that constructs layer-wise adapters by
leveraging hierarchical gradient similarity to enable efficient CL,
particularly for LPMs. To reduce the computational burden of task similarity
estimation, we employ bandit techniques to develop an algorithm based on lower
confidence bounds to efficiently explore the task structure. Furthermore, we
use sparse gradient updates to facilitate parameter optimization, making the
approach better suited for LPMs. Theoretical analysis is provided to justify
the rationale behind our approach, and experiments on both vision transformers
(ViTs) and large language models (LLMs) demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of our approach across various domains, including vision and natural
language processing tasks.

Result: 实验表明，这两种攻击方法在多种预训练LLMs上均能成功推断出敏感属性。

Conclusion: LLMs在微调过程中存在属性推断漏洞，需进一步研究防御措施。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly fine-tuned on domain-specific
datasets to support applications in fields such as healthcare, finance, and
law. These fine-tuning datasets often have sensitive and confidential
dataset-level properties -- such as patient demographics or disease prevalence
-- that are not intended to be revealed. While prior work has studied property
inference attacks on discriminative models (e.g., image classification models)
and generative models (e.g., GANs for image data), it remains unclear if such
attacks transfer to LLMs. In this work, we introduce PropInfer, a benchmark
task for evaluating property inference in LLMs under two fine-tuning paradigms:
question-answering and chat-completion. Built on the ChatDoctor dataset, our
benchmark includes a range of property types and task configurations. We
further propose two tailored attacks: a prompt-based generation attack and a
shadow-model attack leveraging word frequency signals. Empirical evaluations
across multiple pretrained LLMs show the success of our attacks, revealing a
previously unrecognized vulnerability in LLMs.

Conclusion: 研究强调了控制基础模型变异的重要性，为揭示潜在能力间的因果关系提供了科学见解。

Abstract: Faithful evaluation of language model capabilities is crucial for deriving
actionable insights that can inform model development. However, rigorous causal
evaluations in this domain face significant methodological challenges,
including complex confounding effects and prohibitive computational costs
associated with extensive retraining. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
causal representation learning framework wherein observed benchmark performance
is modeled as a linear transformation of a few latent capability factors.
Crucially, these latent factors are identified as causally interrelated after
appropriately controlling for the base model as a common confounder. Applying
this approach to a comprehensive dataset encompassing over 1500 models
evaluated across six benchmarks from the Open LLM Leaderboard, we identify a
concise three-node linear causal structure that reliably explains the observed
performance variations. Further interpretation of this causal structure
provides substantial scientific insights beyond simple numerical rankings:
specifically, we reveal a clear causal direction starting from general
problem-solving capabilities, advancing through instruction-following
proficiency, and culminating in mathematical reasoning ability. Our results
underscore the essential role of carefully controlling base model variations
during evaluation, a step critical to accurately uncovering the underlying
causal relationships among latent model capabilities.

Abstract: Reward Models (RMs), vital for large model alignment, are underexplored for

Conclusion: PAJAMA是一种高效、低成本且透明的LLM评估替代方案，显著优于传统方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used to evaluate the quality of LLM
generations and responses, but this leads to significant challenges: high API
costs, uncertain reliability, inflexible pipelines, and inherent biases. To
address these, we introduce PAJAMA (Program-As-a-Judge for Automated Model

programs instead of directly scoring responses. These synthesized programs can
be stored and run locally, costing orders of magnitude less while providing
interpretable, and auditable judging logic that can be easily adapted.
Program-based judges mitigate biases, improving judgment consistency by 15.83%
and reducing biased responses by 23.7% on average compared to a
Qwen2.5-14B-based LLM-as-a-judge. When program judgments are distilled into a
model, PAJAMA outperforms LLM-as-a-judge on the challenging CHAT-HARD subset of
RewardBench, outperforming metrics by 2.19% on Prometheus and 8.67% on the
JudgeLM dataset, all at three orders of magnitude lower cost.

Result: 在五个美国太平洋地区野火案例中验证，平均Sorensen-Dice系数为0.81，地形对预测影响较小。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效预测野火蔓延，且地形在卫星数据条件下对预测影响有限。

Abstract: Increasing wildfire occurrence has spurred growing interest in wildfire
spread prediction. However, even the most complex wildfire models diverge from
observed progression during multi-day simulations, motivating need for data
assimilation. A useful approach to assimilating measurement data into complex
coupled atmosphere-wildfire models is to estimate wildfire progression from
measurements and use this progression to develop a matching atmospheric state.
In this study, an approach is developed for estimating fire progression from
VIIRS active fire measurements, GOES-derived ignition times, and terrain height
data. A conditional Generative Adversarial Network is trained with simulations
of historic wildfires from the atmosphere-wildfire model WRF-SFIRE, thus
allowing incorporation of WRF-SFIRE physics into estimates. Fire progression is
succinctly represented by fire arrival time, and measurements for training are
obtained by applying an approximate observation operator to WRF-SFIRE
solutions, eliminating need for satellite data during training. The model is
trained on tuples of fire arrival times, measurements, and terrain, and once
trained leverages measurements of real fires and corresponding terrain data to
generate samples of fire arrival times. The approach is validated on five
Pacific US wildfires, with results compared against high-resolution perimeters
measured via aircraft, finding an average Sorensen-Dice coefficient of 0.81.
The influence of terrain height on the arrival time inference is also evaluated
and it is observed that terrain has minimal influence when the inference is
conditioned on satellite measurements.

Abstract: Time series data in real-world applications such as healthcare, climate
modeling, and finance are often irregular, multimodal, and messy, with varying
sampling rates, asynchronous modalities, and pervasive missingness. However,
existing benchmarks typically assume clean, regularly sampled, unimodal data,
creating a significant gap between research and real-world deployment. We
introduce Time-IMM, a dataset specifically designed to capture cause-driven
irregularity in multimodal multivariate time series. Time-IMM represents nine
distinct types of time series irregularity, categorized into trigger-based,
constraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. Complementing the dataset, we
introduce IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting on irregular multimodal
time series, enabling asynchronous integration and realistic evaluation.
IMM-TSF includes specialized fusion modules, including a timestamp-to-text
fusion module and a multimodality fusion module, which support both
recency-aware averaging and attention-based integration strategies. Empirical
results demonstrate that explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular time
series data leads to substantial gains in forecasting performance. Time-IMM and
IMM-TSF provide a foundation for advancing time series analysis under
real-world conditions. The dataset is publicly available at

Method: 结合谱聚类（无监督机器学习）和cLHS，将研究区域划分为K个同质区域，并在每个区域内应用cLHS采样。

Result: 新方法在真实SOC数据集上表现优于标准cLHS，能更均匀地覆盖环境特征空间和空间异质性。

Conclusion: 光谱-cLHS方法能提供更平衡的训练数据，有望提高SOC预测的准确性。

Abstract: Soil organic carbon (SOC) monitoring often relies on selecting representative
field sampling locations based on environmental covariates. We propose a novel
hybrid methodology that integrates spectral clustering - an unsupervised
machine learning technique with conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) to
enhance the representativeness of SOC sampling. In our approach, spectral
clustering partitions the study area into $K$ homogeneous zones using
multivariate covariate data, and cLHS is then applied within each zone to
select sampling locations that collectively capture the full diversity of
environmental conditions. This hybrid spectral-cLHS method ensures that even
minor but important environmental clusters are sampled, addressing a key
limitation of vanilla cLHS which can overlook such areas. We demonstrate on a
real SOC mapping dataset that spectral-cLHS provides more uniform coverage of
covariate feature space and spatial heterogeneity than standard cLHS. This
improved sampling design has the potential to yield more accurate SOC
predictions by providing better-balanced training data for machine learning
models.

Motivation: 大语言模型在边缘设备上推理时面临内存和速度的挑战，需要高效解决方案。

Method: 采用模型量化、DRAM-Flash混合存储、权重重排、多核负载均衡等技术。

Result: MNN-LLM比主流框架快8.6倍。

Conclusion: MNN-LLM为移动设备部署大语言模型提供了高效方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across
a variety of tasks. However, their substantial scale leads to significant
computational resource consumption during inference, resulting in high costs.
Consequently, edge device inference presents a promising solution. The primary
challenges of edge inference include memory usage and inference speed. This
paper introduces MNN-LLM, a framework specifically designed to accelerate the
deployment of large language models on mobile devices. MNN-LLM addresses the
runtime characteristics of LLMs through model quantization and DRAM-Flash
hybrid storage, effectively reducing memory usage. It rearranges weights and
inputs based on mobile CPU instruction sets and GPU characteristics while
employing strategies such as multicore load balancing, mixed-precision
floating-point operations, and geometric computations to enhance performance.
Notably, MNN-LLM achieves up to a 8.6x speed increase compared to current
mainstream LLM-specific frameworks.

Abstract: We introduce Equivariant Neural Diffusion (END), a novel diffusion model for
molecule generation in 3D that is equivariant to Euclidean transformations.
Compared to current state-of-the-art equivariant diffusion models, the key
innovation in END lies in its learnable forward process for enhanced generative
modelling. Rather than pre-specified, the forward process is parameterized
through a time- and data-dependent transformation that is equivariant to rigid
transformations. Through a series of experiments on standard molecule
generation benchmarks, we demonstrate the competitive performance of END
compared to several strong baselines for both unconditional and conditional
generation.

Motivation: 探索在数据稀缺环境下，机器学习模型如何有效预测电力市场价格，尤其是季节性趋势和价格峰值。

Method: 使用LSTM（带FFEC）、XGBoost、LightGBM和CatBoost四种模型，基于ENTSO-E预测数据，在希腊、比利时和爱尔兰三个市场进行测试，训练窗口为7至90天。

Abstract: This study investigates the performance of machine learning models in
forecasting electricity Day-Ahead Market (DAM) prices using short historical
training windows, with a focus on detecting seasonal trends and price spikes.
We evaluate four models, namely LSTM with Feed Forward Error Correction (FFEC),
XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, across three European energy markets (Greece,
Belgium, Ireland) using feature sets derived from ENTSO-E forecast data.
Training window lengths range from 7 to 90 days, allowing assessment of model
adaptability under constrained data availability. Results indicate that
LightGBM consistently achieves the highest forecasting accuracy and robustness,
particularly with 45 and 60 day training windows, which balance temporal
relevance and learning depth. Furthermore, LightGBM demonstrates superior
detection of seasonal effects and peak price events compared to LSTM and other
boosting models. These findings suggest that short-window training approaches,
combined with boosting methods, can effectively support DAM forecasting in
volatile, data-scarce environments.

Motivation: 由于缺乏熟练工程师且手动优化耗时，PCB设计中的最佳实践常被忽视，导致后期开发成本高和产品寿命缩短。自动化优化可解决这些问题。

Method: 将PCB设计表示为二分图，利用GNN模型预测需要添加的组件节点对，并在三个实际任务中验证多种GNN架构的性能。

Result: 实验表明，GNN能以高精度解决PCB优化问题，且方法具有时间和成本效益。

Conclusion: 该方法为PCB设计优化提供了自动化解决方案，有望减少电子浪费并提高产品可靠性。

Abstract: The design and optimization of Printed Circuit Board (PCB) schematics is
crucial for the development of high-quality electronic devices. Thereby, an
important task is to optimize drafts by adding components that improve the
robustness and reliability of the circuit, e.g., pull-up resistors or
decoupling capacitors. Since there is a shortage of skilled engineers and
manual optimizations are very time-consuming, these best practices are often
neglected. However, this typically leads to higher costs for troubleshooting in
later development stages as well as shortened product life cycles, resulting in
an increased amount of electronic waste that is difficult to recycle. Here, we
present an approach for automating the addition of new components into PCB
schematics by representing them as bipartite graphs and utilizing a node pair
prediction model based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We apply our approach
to three highly relevant PCB design optimization tasks and compare the
performance of several popular GNN architectures on real-world datasets labeled
by human experts. We show that GNNs can solve these problems with high accuracy
and demonstrate that our approach offers the potential to automate PCB design
optimizations in a time- and cost-efficient manner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统公平性评估方法依赖于单点估计和预定义阈值，忽略了抽样误差和小群体的统计问题，尤其是在交叉性分析中数据稀疏时更为严重。

Method: 提出两种方法：(i) 对大子群证明统计奇偶差异的中心极限定理，使用Wald检验；(ii) 对小子群采用贝叶斯Dirichlet-多项式估计器，通过蒙特卡洛可信区间校准。

Result: 在基准数据集上验证了方法的有效性，展示了在不同数据量和交叉性条件下的可解释性和统计严谨性。

Conclusion: 该框架为公平性评估提供了统计上可靠的决策支持，尤其适用于交叉性分析中的小群体问题。

Abstract: Determining whether an algorithmic decision-making system discriminates
against a specific demographic typically involves comparing a single point
estimate of a fairness metric against a predefined threshold. This practice is
statistically brittle: it ignores sampling error and treats small demographic
subgroups the same as large ones. The problem intensifies in intersectional
analyses, where multiple sensitive attributes are considered jointly, giving
rise to a larger number of smaller groups. As these groups become more
granular, the data representing them becomes too sparse for reliable
estimation, and fairness metrics yield excessively wide confidence intervals,
precluding meaningful conclusions about potential unfair treatments.
  In this paper, we introduce a unified, size-adaptive, hypothesis-testing
framework that turns fairness assessment into an evidence-based statistical
decision. Our contribution is twofold. (i) For sufficiently large subgroups, we
prove a Central-Limit result for the statistical parity difference, leading to
analytic confidence intervals and a Wald test whose type-I (false positive)
error is guaranteed at level $\alpha$. (ii) For the long tail of small
intersectional groups, we derive a fully Bayesian Dirichlet-multinomial
estimator; Monte-Carlo credible intervals are calibrated for any sample size
and naturally converge to Wald intervals as more data becomes available. We
validate our approach empirically on benchmark datasets, demonstrating how our
tests provide interpretable, statistically rigorous decisions under varying
degrees of data availability and intersectionality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了非平稳在线学习中动态遗憾最小化问题，针对具有更强曲率的损失函数（如平方或逻辑损失），提出了一种基于mixability的改进方法，显著降低了动态遗憾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态遗憾最小化研究主要集中在凸函数上，对具有更强曲率的损失函数研究不足。本文旨在填补这一空白，利用mixability概念改进动态遗憾。

Method: 采用指数权重方法结合固定共享更新，利用mixability性质简化分析框架，避免现有工作中复杂的KKT分析。

Result: 证明了该方法在mixable损失下可实现$\mathcal{O}(d T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$的动态遗憾，优于现有最佳结果$\mathcal{O}(d^{10/3} T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$。

Conclusion: 通过mixability的简单分析框架，显著改进了动态遗憾，为更广泛的损失函数提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Non-stationary online learning has drawn much attention in recent years.
Despite considerable progress, dynamic regret minimization has primarily
focused on convex functions, leaving the functions with stronger curvature
(e.g., squared or logistic loss) underexplored. In this work, we address this
gap by showing that the regret can be substantially improved by leveraging the
concept of mixability, a property that generalizes exp-concavity to effectively
capture loss curvature. Let $d$ denote the dimensionality and $P_T$ the path
length of comparators that reflects the environmental non-stationarity. We
demonstrate that an exponential-weight method with fixed-share updates achieves
an $\mathcal{O}(d T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$ dynamic regret for mixable losses,
improving upon the best-known $\mathcal{O}(d^{10/3} T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$
result (Baby and Wang, 2021) in $d$. More importantly, this improvement arises
from a simple yet powerful analytical framework that exploits the mixability,
which avoids the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-based analysis required by existing work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决纸基ECG记录数字化中信号重叠的常见但未充分解决的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：1）基于U-Net的分割网络处理信号重叠；2）自适应网格检测模块增强数字化。

Result: U-Net分割IoU为0.87；数字化任务中，非重叠信号MSE为0.0010，重叠信号MSE为0.0029，均优于基线。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了数字化准确性，尤其在信号重叠情况下，为临床和研究提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: This paper addresses the persistent challenge of accurately digitizing
paper-based electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, with a particular focus on
robustly handling single leads compromised by signal overlaps-a common yet
under-addressed issue in existing methodologies. We propose a two-stage
pipeline designed to overcome this limitation. The first stage employs a U-Net
based segmentation network, trained on a dataset enriched with overlapping
signals and fortified with custom data augmentations, to accurately isolate the
primary ECG trace. The subsequent stage converts this refined binary mask into
a time-series signal using established digitization techniques, enhanced by an
adaptive grid detection module for improved versatility across different ECG
formats and scales. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach. The U-Net architecture achieves an IoU of 0.87 for the fine-grained
segmentation task. Crucially, our proposed digitization method yields superior
performance compared to a well-established baseline technique across both
non-overlapping and challenging overlapping ECG samples. For non-overlapping
signals, our method achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0010 and a Pearson
Correlation Coefficient (rho) of 0.9644, compared to 0.0015 and 0.9366,
respectively, for the baseline. On samples with signal overlap, our method
achieved an MSE of 0.0029 and a rho of 0.9641, significantly improving upon the
baseline's 0.0178 and 0.8676. This work demonstrates an effective strategy to
significantly enhance digitization accuracy, especially in the presence of
signal overlaps, thereby laying a strong foundation for the reliable conversion
of analog ECG records into analyzable digital data for contemporary research
and clinical applications. The implementation is publicly available at this
GitHub repository: https://github.com/masoudrahimi39/ECG-code.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模图学习中，传统方法因维度平方增长而难以处理，需要一种高效的降维方法。

Method: 利用低秩分解条件相关矩阵，结合黎曼优化技术，提出了一种改进的GLasso算法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在合成和真实数据上实现了高效的维度与性能权衡。

Conclusion: 低秩分解方法为大规模图学习提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of learning an undirected graph from data
gathered at each nodes. Within the graph signal processing framework, the
topology of such graph can be linked to the support of the conditional
correlation matrix of the data. The corresponding graph learning problem then
scales to the squares of the number of variables (nodes), which is usually
problematic at large dimension. To tackle this issue, we propose a graph
learning framework that leverages a low-rank factorization of the conditional
correlation matrix. In order to solve for the resulting optimization problems,
we derive tools required to apply Riemannian optimization techniques for this
particular structure. The proposal is then particularized to a low-rank
constrained counterpart of the GLasso algorithm, i.e., the penalized maximum
likelihood estimation of a Gaussian graphical model. Experiments on synthetic
and real data evidence that a very efficient dimension-versus-performance
trade-off can be achieved with this approach.

Motivation: MISL方法在无监督强化学习中缺乏对技能多样性和可分离性的理论分析，无法保证其学习到的技能对下游任务的适应性。

Method: 提出了新的度量LSEPIN，并基于Wasserstein距离设计了技能学习目标WSEP和算法PWSEP。

Result: WSEP和PWSEP在理论上能更好地适应下游任务，并发现更多初始策略。

Conclusion: 基于Wasserstein距离的方法在无监督强化学习中具有更好的理论支持和实际效果。

Abstract: Unsupervised reinforcement learning (URL) aims to learn general skills for
unseen downstream tasks. Mutual Information Skill Learning (MISL) addresses URL
by maximizing the mutual information between states and skills but lacks
sufficient theoretical analysis, e.g., how well its learned skills can
initialize a downstream task's policy. Our new theoretical analysis in this
paper shows that the diversity and separability of learned skills are
fundamentally critical to downstream task adaptation but MISL does not
necessarily guarantee these properties. To complement MISL, we propose a novel
disentanglement metric LSEPIN. Moreover, we build an information-geometric
connection between LSEPIN and downstream task adaptation cost. For better
geometric properties, we investigate a new strategy that replaces the KL
divergence in information geometry with Wasserstein distance. We extend the
geometric analysis to it, which leads to a novel skill-learning objective WSEP.
It is theoretically justified to be helpful to downstream task adaptation and
it is capable of discovering more initial policies for downstream tasks than
MISL. We finally propose another Wasserstein distance-based algorithm PWSEP
that can theoretically discover all optimal initial policies.

TL;DR: 论文提出Time-R1框架，通过两阶段强化微调提升LLMs在时间序列预测中的多步推理能力，显著提高了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列预测方法缺乏显式推理过程，而LLMs虽具备多步推理潜力，但仅依赖提示工程存在计算成本高、隐私风险等问题。

Method: 提出Time-R1框架，包括监督微调阶段和强化学习阶段，设计细粒度多目标奖励和GRIP策略优化推理路径。

Result: 实验表明Time-R1在多样数据集上显著提升了预测性能。

Conclusion: Time-R1为时间序列预测提供了一种结合慢思考和多步推理的有效方法。

Abstract: To advance time series forecasting (TSF), various methods have been proposed
to improve prediction accuracy, evolving from statistical techniques to
data-driven deep learning architectures. Despite their effectiveness, most
existing methods still adhere to a fast thinking paradigm-relying on extracting
historical patterns and mapping them to future values as their core modeling
philosophy, lacking an explicit thinking process that incorporates intermediate
time series reasoning. Meanwhile, emerging slow-thinking LLMs (e.g., OpenAI-o1)
have shown remarkable multi-step reasoning capabilities, offering an
alternative way to overcome these issues. However, prompt engineering alone
presents several limitations - including high computational cost, privacy
risks, and limited capacity for in-depth domain-specific time series reasoning.
To address these limitations, a more promising approach is to train LLMs to
develop slow thinking capabilities and acquire strong time series reasoning
skills. For this purpose, we propose Time-R1, a two-stage reinforcement
fine-tuning framework designed to enhance multi-step reasoning ability of LLMs
for time series forecasting. Specifically, the first stage conducts supervised
fine-tuning for warmup adaptation, while the second stage employs reinforcement
learning to improve the model's generalization ability. Particularly, we design
a fine-grained multi-objective reward specifically for time series forecasting,
and then introduce GRIP (group-based relative importance for policy
optimization), which leverages non-uniform sampling to further encourage and
optimize the model's exploration of effective reasoning paths. Experiments
demonstrate that Time-R1 significantly improves forecast performance across
diverse datasets.

Conclusion: 该方法为扩散模型潜在空间的复杂结构及其与物理现象的关联提供了新见解。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for analyzing the latent space geometry of
generative models, including statistical physics models and diffusion models,
by reconstructing the Fisher information metric. The method approximates the
posterior distribution of latent variables given generated samples and uses
this to learn the log-partition function, which defines the Fisher metric for
exponential families. Theoretical convergence guarantees are provided, and the
method is validated on the Ising and TASEP models, outperforming existing
baselines in reconstructing thermodynamic quantities. Applied to diffusion
models, the method reveals a fractal structure of phase transitions in the
latent space, characterized by abrupt changes in the Fisher metric. We
demonstrate that while geodesic interpolations are approximately linear within
individual phases, this linearity breaks down at phase boundaries, where the
diffusion model exhibits a divergent Lipschitz constant with respect to the
latent space. These findings provide new insights into the complex structure of
diffusion model latent spaces and their connection to phenomena like phase
transitions. Our source code is available at

Motivation: 现实场景中，训练与测试分布不一致及数据污染普遍存在，但此前未系统研究其对CoT模型的影响。

Method: 以k-奇偶问题为例，分析分布偏移与数据污染的联合影响，对比CoT分解与直接预测的效果。

Result: 发现CoT在数据偏移下表现更差，并给出机制性解释。

Conclusion: CoT在数据偏移场景下可能适得其反，需谨慎应用。

Abstract: Chain of Thought (CoT) has been applied to various large language models
(LLMs) and proven to be effective in improving the quality of outputs. In
recent studies, transformers are proven to have absolute upper bounds in terms
of expressive power, and consequently, they cannot solve many computationally
difficult problems. However, empowered by CoT, transformers are proven to be
able to solve some difficult problems effectively, such as the $k$-parity
problem. Nevertheless, those works rely on two imperative assumptions: (1)
identical training and testing distribution, and (2) corruption-free training
data with correct reasoning steps. However, in the real world, these
assumptions do not always hold. Although the risks of data shifts have caught
attention, our work is the first to rigorously study the exact harm caused by
such shifts to the best of our knowledge. Focusing on the $k$-parity problem,
in this work we investigate the joint impact of two types of data shifts: the
distribution shifts and data poisoning, on the quality of trained models
obtained by a well-established CoT decomposition. In addition to revealing a
surprising phenomenon that CoT leads to worse performance on learning parity
than directly generating the prediction, our technical results also give a
rigorous and comprehensive explanation of the mechanistic reasons of such
impact.

Abstract: Continual learning poses a fundamental challenge for neural systems, which

Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), despite their interpretability and efficiency, are
not immune to this issue. In this paper, we introduce Saturation
Self-Organizing Maps (SatSOM)-an extension of SOMs designed to improve
knowledge retention in continual learning scenarios. SatSOM incorporates a
novel saturation mechanism that gradually reduces the learning rate and
neighborhood radius of neurons as they accumulate information. This effectively
freezes well-trained neurons and redirects learning to underutilized areas of
the map.

Method: SPLICE通过斜投影技术移除敏感概念，同时精确保护目标标签的协方差。

Result: 在Bias in Bios和Winobias等基准测试中，SPLICE优于基线方法，移除保护属性且最小化主任务信息损失。

Conclusion: SPLICE是唯一能线性移除概念并保持目标协方差的解决方案，理论独特且实证有效。

Abstract: Modern neural networks often encode unwanted concepts alongside task-relevant
information, leading to fairness and interpretability concerns. Existing
post-hoc approaches can remove undesired concepts but often degrade useful
signals. We introduce SPLICE-Simultaneous Projection for LInear concept removal
and Covariance prEservation-which eliminates sensitive concepts from
representations while exactly preserving their covariance with a target label.
SPLICE achieves this via an oblique projection that "splices out" the unwanted
direction yet protects important label correlations. Theoretically, it is the
unique solution that removes linear concept predictability and maintains target
covariance with minimal embedding distortion. Empirically, SPLICE outperforms
baselines on benchmarks such as Bias in Bios and Winobias, removing protected
attributes while minimally damaging main-task information.

Abstract: Tabular in-context learning (ICL) has recently achieved state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance on several tabular prediction tasks. Previously restricted
to classification problems on small tables, recent advances such as TabPFN and
TabICL have extended its use to larger datasets. While being architecturally
efficient and well-adapted to tabular data structures, current table-native ICL
architectures, being trained exclusively on synthetic data, do not fully
leverage the rich semantics and world knowledge contained in real-world tabular
data. On another end of this spectrum, tabular ICL models based on pretrained
large language models such as TabuLa-8B integrate deep semantic understanding
and world knowledge but are only able to make use of a small amount of context
due to inherent architectural limitations. With the aim to combine the best of
both these worlds, we introduce ConTextTab, integrating semantic understanding
and alignment into a table-native ICL framework. By employing specialized

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Neural的方法，通过分阶段处理临床QA任务，结合数据驱动的提示优化，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决电子健康记录（EHRs）中的自动问答问题，为临床医生和患者提供精确且可信赖的信息。

Method: 将任务分解为句子级证据识别和带明确引用的答案生成，利用DSPy的MIPROv2优化器自动探索提示空间，并通过自一致性投票方案提升证据召回率。

Result: 在隐藏测试集上获得51.5分，排名第二，显著优于零样本和少样本提示方法。

Conclusion: 数据驱动的提示优化是高风险临床QA任务中模型微调的有效替代方案，提升了医疗AI助手的可靠性。

Abstract: Automated question answering (QA) over electronic health records (EHRs) can
bridge critical information gaps for clinicians and patients, yet it demands
both precise evidence retrieval and faithful answer generation under limited
supervision. In this work, we present Neural, the runner-up in the BioNLP 2025
ArchEHR-QA shared task on evidence-grounded clinical QA. Our proposed method
decouples the task into (1) sentence-level evidence identification and (2)
answer synthesis with explicit citations. For each stage, we automatically
explore the prompt space with DSPy's MIPROv2 optimizer, jointly tuning
instructions and few-shot demonstrations on the development set. A
self-consistency voting scheme further improves evidence recall without
sacrificing precision. On the hidden test set, our method attains an overall
score of 51.5, placing second stage while outperforming standard zero-shot and
few-shot prompting by over 20 and 10 points, respectively. These results
indicate that data-driven prompt optimization is a cost-effective alternative
to model fine-tuning for high-stakes clinical QA, advancing the reliability of
AI assistants in healthcare.

Motivation: 传统数值天气预报（NWP）在精度和速度上不如机器学习模型，FGN旨在提供更优的全球概率天气预报。

Method: FGN通过模型扰动生成集合预报，训练目标是直接最小化CRPS，仅基于边缘分布捕捉联合空间结构。

Conclusion: FGN是一种高效的天气预测模型，优于现有方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML)-based weather models have rapidly risen to prominence
due to their greater accuracy and speed than traditional forecasts based on
numerical weather prediction (NWP), recently outperforming traditional
ensembles in global probabilistic weather forecasting. This paper presents FGN,
a simple, scalable and flexible modeling approach which significantly
outperforms the current state-of-the-art models. FGN generates ensembles via
learned model-perturbations with an ensemble of appropriately constrained
models. It is trained directly to minimize the continuous rank probability
score (CRPS) of per-location forecasts. It produces state-of-the-art ensemble
forecasts as measured by a range of deterministic and probabilistic metrics,
makes skillful ensemble tropical cyclone track predictions, and captures joint
spatial structure despite being trained only on marginals.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究单调分类问题中，如何以最小成本找到误差不超过最优误差$(1 + \epsilon)$倍的单调分类器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法只能以绝对误差限制分类器误差，无法满足相对误差需求，因此需要研究更高效的算法。

Method: 提出新的算法，通过揭示部分点的标签，找到误差不超过$(1 + \epsilon) \cdot k^*$的单调分类器。

Result: 给出了几乎匹配的上界和下界，覆盖所有$\epsilon$范围。

Conclusion: 首次实现了相对误差限制的单调分类器设计，填补了研究空白。

Abstract: In monotone classification, the input is a multi-set $P$ of points in
$\mathbb{R}^d$, each associated with a hidden label from $\{-1, 1\}$. The goal
is to identify a monotone function $h$, which acts as a classifier, mapping
from $\mathbb{R}^d$ to $\{-1, 1\}$ with a small {\em error}, measured as the
number of points $p \in P$ whose labels differ from the function values $h(p)$.
The cost of an algorithm is defined as the number of points having their labels
revealed. This article presents the first study on the lowest cost required to
find a monotone classifier whose error is at most $(1 + \epsilon) \cdot k^*$
where $\epsilon \ge 0$ and $k^*$ is the minimum error achieved by an optimal
monotone classifier -- in other words, the error is allowed to exceed the
optimal by at most a relative factor. Nearly matching upper and lower bounds
are presented for the full range of $\epsilon$. All previous work on the
problem can only achieve an error higher than the optimal by an absolute
factor.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的能量函数log-sum-ReLU (LSR)，用于Dense Associative Memory (DenseAM)网络，基于Epanechnikov核，实现了精确记忆检索和指数容量，同时引入了大量新的局部极小值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统log-sum-exponential (LSE)函数需要指数分离函数，而LSR通过Epanechnikov核避免了这一需求，同时保留了完美的模式恢复能力。

Method: 基于Epanechnikov核设计了LSR能量函数，并通过实验验证其性能。

Result: LSR能量函数具有更多的局部极小值（记忆点），且其对数似然与LSE模型相当。在图像数据集上，LSR表现出创造性和新颖性。

Conclusion: LSR在记忆存储和生成任务中具有潜力，为DenseAM领域提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: We propose a novel energy function for Dense Associative Memory (DenseAM)
networks, the log-sum-ReLU (LSR), inspired by optimal kernel density
estimation. Unlike the common log-sum-exponential (LSE) function, LSR is based
on the Epanechnikov kernel and enables exact memory retrieval with exponential
capacity without requiring exponential separation functions. Moreover, it
introduces abundant additional \emph{emergent} local minima while preserving
perfect pattern recovery -- a characteristic previously unseen in DenseAM
literature. Empirical results show that LSR energy has significantly more local
minima (memories) that have comparable log-likelihood to LSE-based models.
Analysis of LSR's emergent memories on image datasets reveals a degree of
creativity and novelty, hinting at this method's potential for both large-scale
memory storage and generative tasks.

Result: 探针性能接近中等规模LLM监测器，计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: 激活探针可作为高效初始过滤器，支持构建分层监测系统。

Abstract: Monitoring is an important aspect of safely deploying Large Language Models
(LLMs). This paper examines activation probes for detecting "high-stakes"
interactions -- where the text indicates that the interaction might lead to
significant harm -- as a critical, yet underexplored, target for such
monitoring. We evaluate several probe architectures trained on synthetic data,
and find them to exhibit robust generalization to diverse, out-of-distribution,
real-world data. Probes' performance is comparable to that of prompted or
finetuned medium-sized LLM monitors, while offering computational savings of
six orders-of-magnitude. Our experiments also highlight the potential of
building resource-aware hierarchical monitoring systems, where probes serve as
an efficient initial filter and flag cases for more expensive downstream
analysis. We release our novel synthetic dataset and codebase to encourage
further study.

TL;DR: 该论文系统研究了动态深度学习系统（DDLSs）的效率鲁棒性，首次提出了效率攻击的综合分类，并分析了现有防御机制的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着动态深度学习系统在资源受限环境中的广泛应用，其动态行为引入了新的攻击面，效率对抗攻击成为威胁。

Method: 通过分类效率攻击（基于动态计算、推理迭代和输出生产），深入评估攻击策略，并分析现有防御机制。

Result: 研究发现现有防御机制对效率攻击的防护不足，需开发新的缓解策略。

Conclusion: 未来自适应DDLSs的安全需要针对效率攻击的新型防御策略。

Abstract: Deep Learning Systems (DLSs) are increasingly deployed in real-time
applications, including those in resourceconstrained environments such as
mobile and IoT devices. To address efficiency challenges, Dynamic Deep Learning
Systems (DDLSs) adapt inference computation based on input complexity, reducing
overhead. While this dynamic behavior improves efficiency, such behavior
introduces new attack surfaces. In particular, efficiency adversarial attacks
exploit these dynamic mechanisms to degrade system performance. This paper
systematically explores efficiency robustness of DDLSs, presenting the first
comprehensive taxonomy of efficiency attacks. We categorize these attacks based
on three dynamic behaviors: (i) attacks on dynamic computations per inference,
(ii) attacks on dynamic inference iterations, and (iii) attacks on dynamic
output production for downstream tasks. Through an in-depth evaluation, we
analyze adversarial strategies that target DDLSs efficiency and identify key
challenges in securing these systems. In addition, we investigate existing
defense mechanisms, demonstrating their limitations against increasingly
popular efficiency attacks and the necessity for novel mitigation strategies to
secure future adaptive DDLSs.

Conclusion: 该框架为信用卡欺诈检测提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: The rise of digital payments has accelerated the need for intelligent and
scalable systems to detect fraud. This research presents an end-to-end,
feature-rich machine learning framework for detecting credit card transaction
anomalies and fraud using real-world data. The study begins by merging
transactional, cardholder, merchant, and merchant category datasets from a
relational database to create a unified analytical view. Through the feature
engineering process, we extract behavioural signals such as average spending,
deviation from historical patterns, transaction timing irregularities, and
category frequency metrics. These features are enriched with temporal markers
such as hour, day of week, and weekend indicators to expose all latent patterns
that indicate fraudulent behaviours. Exploratory data analysis reveals
contextual transaction trends across all the dataset features. Using the
transactional data, we train and evaluate a range of unsupervised models:
Isolation Forest, One Class SVM, and a deep autoencoder trained to reconstruct
normal behavior. These models flag the top 1% of reconstruction errors as
outliers. PCA visualizations illustrate each models ability to separate
anomalies into a two-dimensional latent space. We further segment the
transaction landscape using K-Means clustering and DBSCAN to identify dense
clusters of normal activity and isolate sparse, suspicious regions.

Motivation: 尽管强化学习（RL）近期取得许多进展，但在未知干扰下学习满足状态约束的策略仍是一个开放问题。

Method: 分析熵正则化与约束惩罚在模型无关RL中的相互作用，揭示熵正则化如何偏向最大化未来可行动作数量以提升鲁棒性。

Result: 通过松弛严格安全约束为惩罚，将约束RL问题近似为无约束问题，实验表明其能保持安全性和最优性，并提升对干扰的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 熵正则化与鲁棒性的关联为RL中的鲁棒安全性提供了简单奖励塑形的新途径，值得进一步研究。

Abstract: Despite the many recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL), the question
of learning policies that robustly satisfy state constraints under unknown
disturbances remains open. In this paper, we offer a new perspective on
achieving robust safety by analyzing the interplay between two well-established
techniques in model-free RL: entropy regularization, and constraints
penalization. We reveal empirically that entropy regularization in constrained
RL inherently biases learning toward maximizing the number of future viable
actions, thereby promoting constraints satisfaction robust to action noise.
Furthermore, we show that by relaxing strict safety constraints through
penalties, the constrained RL problem can be approximated arbitrarily closely
by an unconstrained one and thus solved using standard model-free RL. This
reformulation preserves both safety and optimality while empirically improving
resilience to disturbances. Our results indicate that the connection between
entropy regularization and robustness is a promising avenue for further
empirical and theoretical investigation, as it enables robust safety in RL
through simple reward shaping.

Result: 实验证明新攻击方法在理论和实际数据上均表现良好。

Conclusion: "lattice climber attack"是一种更有效的攻击分类器混合模型的方法。

Abstract: Finite mixtures of classifiers (a.k.a. randomized ensembles) have been
proposed as a way to improve robustness against adversarial attacks. However,
existing attacks have been shown to not suit this kind of classifier. In this
paper, we discuss the problem of attacking a mixture in a principled way and
introduce two desirable properties of attacks based on a geometrical analysis
of the problem (effectiveness and maximality). We then show that existing
attacks do not meet both of these properties. Finally, we introduce a new
attack called {\em lattice climber attack} with theoretical guarantees in the
binary linear setting, and demonstrate its performance by conducting
experiments on synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: Duo方法通过结合高斯扩散技术，显著提升了均匀状态扩散模型的性能，为快速文本生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Uniform-state discrete diffusion models hold the promise of fast text
generation due to their inherent ability to self-correct. However, they are
typically outperformed by autoregressive models and masked diffusion models. In
this work, we narrow this performance gap by leveraging a key insight:
Uniform-state diffusion processes naturally emerge from an underlying Gaussian
diffusion. Our method, Duo, transfers powerful techniques from Gaussian
diffusion to improve both training and sampling. First, we introduce a
curriculum learning strategy guided by the Gaussian process, doubling training
speed by reducing variance. Models trained with curriculum learning surpass
autoregressive models in zero-shot perplexity on 3 of 7 benchmarks. Second, we
present Discrete Consistency Distillation, which adapts consistency
distillation from the continuous to the discrete setting. This algorithm
unlocks few-step generation in diffusion language models by accelerating
sampling by two orders of magnitude. We provide the code and model checkpoints

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为NoLoCo的新型优化方法，通过部分随机平均模型权重避免显式同步，显著减少通信开销，适用于大规模语言模型训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练大规模语言模型通常需要高带宽互联的计算集群，成本高昂且扩展受限。现有低通信训练方法仍需同步模型参数，导致低带宽网络下效率低下。

Method: 提出NoLoCo优化方法，通过Nesterov动量优化器的变体隐式同步模型权重，避免集体通信。

Result: 实验表明，NoLoCo在125M至6.8B参数范围内显著减少通信开销，同步速度比DiLoCo快一个数量级，且收敛速度快4%。

Conclusion: NoLoCo是一种高效的低通信训练方法，适用于大规模模型训练，尤其适合低带宽网络环境。

Abstract: Training large language models is generally done via optimization methods on
clusters containing tens of thousands of accelerators, communicating over a
high-bandwidth interconnect. Scaling up these clusters is expensive and can
become impractical, imposing limits on the size of models that can be trained.
Several recent studies have proposed training methods that are less
communication intensive, avoiding the need for a highly connected compute
cluster. These state-of-the-art low communication training methods still employ
a synchronization step for model parameters, which, when performed over all
model replicas, can become costly on a low-bandwidth network.
  In this work, we propose a novel optimization method, NoLoCo, that does not
explicitly synchronize all model parameters during training and, as a result,
does not require any collective communication. NoLoCo implicitly synchronizes
model weights via a novel variant of the Nesterov momentum optimizer by
partially averaging model weights with a randomly selected other one. We
provide both a theoretical convergence analysis for our proposed optimizer as
well as empirical results from language model training.
  We benchmark NoLoCo on a wide range of accelerator counts and model sizes,
between 125M to 6.8B parameters. Our method requires significantly less
communication overhead than fully sharded data parallel training or even widely
used low communication training method, DiLoCo. The synchronization step itself
is estimated to be one magnitude faster than the all-reduce used in DiLoCo for
few hundred accelerators training over the internet. We also do not have any
global blocking communication that reduces accelerator idling time. Compared to
DiLoCo, we also observe up to $4\%$ faster convergence rate with wide range of
model sizes and accelerator counts.

Result: CausalFM在条件平均处理效应（CATE）估计任务中表现优异，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CausalFM为因果推断提供了一种新范式，有望在医学、经济学等领域广泛应用。

Abstract: Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) have recently been proposed as a promising
way to train tabular foundation models. PFNs are transformers that are
pre-trained on synthetic data generated from a prespecified prior distribution
and that enable Bayesian inference through in-context learning. In this paper,
we introduce CausalFM, a comprehensive framework for training PFN-based
foundation models in various causal inference settings. First, we formalize the
construction of Bayesian priors for causal inference based on structural causal
models (SCMs) in a principled way and derive necessary criteria for the
validity of such priors. Building on this, we propose a novel family of prior
distributions using causality-inspired Bayesian neural networks that enable
CausalFM to perform Bayesian causal inference in various settings, including
back-door, front-door, and instrumental variable adjustment. Finally, we
instantiate CausalFM and explicitly train a foundation model for estimating
conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) using back-door adjustment. We
show that CausalFM performs competitively for CATE estimation using various
synthetic and semi-synthetic benchmarks. In sum, our framework can be used as a
general recipe to train foundation models for various causal inference
settings. In contrast to the current state-of-the-art in causal inference,
CausalFM offers a novel paradigm with the potential to fundamentally change how
practitioners perform causal inference in medicine, economics, and other
disciplines.

Conclusion: PSMs为神经序列模型的设计提供了更通用的框架，平衡了表达能力和计算效率。

Abstract: Modern neural sequence models are designed to meet the dual mandate of
parallelizable training and fast sequential inference. Recent developments have
given rise to various models, such as Gated Linear Attention (GLA) and Mamba,
that achieve such ``sequential-parallel duality.'' This raises a natural
question: can we characterize the full class of neural sequence models that
support near-constant-time parallel evaluation and linear-time, constant-space
sequential inference? We begin by describing a broad class of such models --
state space models -- as those whose state updates can be computed using the
classic parallel prefix scan algorithm with a custom associative aggregation
operator. We then define a more general class, Prefix-Scannable Models (PSMs),
by relaxing the state aggregation operator to allow arbitrary (potentially
non-associative) functions such as softmax attention. This generalization
unifies many existing architectures, including element-wise RNNs (e.g., Mamba)
and linear transformers (e.g., GLA, Mamba2, mLSTM), while also introducing new
models with softmax-like operators that achieve O(1) amortized compute per
token and log(N) memory for sequence length N. We empirically evaluate such
models on illustrative small-scale language modeling and canonical synthetic
tasks, including state tracking and associative recall. Empirically, we find
that PSMs retain the expressivity of transformer-based architectures while
matching the inference efficiency of state space models -- in some cases
exhibiting better length generalization than either.

Motivation: LLMs在高风险招聘应用中的偏见问题直接影响职业和生计，需探索更有效的偏见缓解方法。

Method: 通过识别和中和模型激活中的敏感属性方向，采用内部偏见缓解策略。

Result: 在商业和开源模型中，内部缓解方法将偏见降至极低水平（通常低于1%），同时保持模型性能。

Conclusion: 建议采用更现实的评估方法和内部缓解策略以确保公平结果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes hiring
applications, making decisions that directly impact people's careers and
livelihoods. While prior studies suggest simple anti-bias prompts can eliminate
demographic biases in controlled evaluations, we find these mitigations fail
when realistic contextual details are introduced. We address these failures
through internal bias mitigation: by identifying and neutralizing sensitive
attribute directions within model activations, we achieve robust bias reduction
across all tested scenarios. Across leading commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 4
Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash) and open-source models (Gemma-2 27B, Gemma-3,
Mistral-24B), we find that adding realistic context such as company names,
culture descriptions from public careers pages, and selective hiring
constraints (e.g.,``only accept candidates in the top 10\%") induces
significant racial and gender biases (up to 12\% differences in interview
rates). When these biases emerge, they consistently favor Black over White
candidates and female over male candidates across all tested models and
scenarios. Moreover, models can infer demographics and become biased from
subtle cues like college affiliations, with these biases remaining invisible
even when inspecting the model's chain-of-thought reasoning. To address these
limitations, our internal bias mitigation identifies race and gender-correlated
directions and applies affine concept editing at inference time. Despite using
directions from a simple synthetic dataset, the intervention generalizes
robustly, consistently reducing bias to very low levels (typically under 1\%,
always below 2.5\%) while largely maintaining model performance. Our findings
suggest that practitioners deploying LLMs for hiring should adopt more
realistic evaluation methodologies and consider internal mitigation strategies
for equitable outcomes.

Result: 在知识整合和少样本泛化任务中表现良好。

Conclusion: SEAL是实现语言模型自我适应的重要一步。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful but static; they lack mechanisms to
adapt their weights in response to new tasks, knowledge, or examples. We
introduce Self-Adapting LLMs (SEAL), a framework that enables LLMs to
self-adapt by generating their own finetuning data and update directives. Given
a new input, the model produces a self-edit-a generation that may restructure
the information in different ways, specify optimization hyperparameters, or
invoke tools for data augmentation and gradient-based updates. Through
supervised finetuning (SFT), these self-edits result in persistent weight
updates, enabling lasting adaptation. To train the model to produce effective
self-edits, we use a reinforcement learning loop with the downstream
performance of the updated model as the reward signal. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on separate adaptation modules or auxiliary networks, SEAL directly
uses the model's own generation to control its adaptation process. Experiments
on knowledge incorporation and few-shot generalization show that SEAL is a
promising step toward language models capable of self-directed adaptation. Our

### [226] [GUARD: Guided Unlearning and Retention via Data Attribution for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10946)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GUARD是一个针对大语言模型（LLM）的轻量级数据归因框架，通过自适应权重分配减少遗忘过程中的非预期信息损失，显著提升模型保留能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于法规合规、版权保护和隐私问题，LLM的遗忘技术变得重要，但现有方法在遗忘高影响力数据时会导致模型性能下降。

Method: GUARD引入了一种轻量级代理数据归因指标，量化遗忘集和保留集的“对齐”程度，并设计了一种基于归因分数的自适应非均匀遗忘权重分配方法。

Result: 在TOFU基准测试中，GUARD显著提升了模型保留能力，遗忘10%训练数据时，保留集的Truth Ratio牺牲减少了194.92%。

Conclusion: GUARD通过数据归因和自适应权重分配，有效解决了LLM遗忘中的非预期信息损失问题，同时保持了遗忘效果。

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly important
due to regulatory compliance, copyright protection, and privacy concerns.
However, a key challenge in LLM unlearning is unintended forgetting, where the
removal of specific data inadvertently impairs the utility of the model and its
retention of valuable, desired information. While prior work has primarily
focused on architectural innovations, the influence of data-level factors on
unlearning performance remains underexplored. As a result, existing methods
often suffer from degraded retention when forgetting high-impact data. To
address this, we propose GUARD-a novel framework for Guided Unlearning And
Retention via Data attribution. At its core, GUARD introduces a lightweight
proxy data attribution metric tailored for LLM unlearning, which quantifies the
"alignment" between the forget and retain sets while remaining computationally
efficient. Building on this, we design a novel unlearning objective that
assigns adaptive, nonuniform unlearning weights to samples, inversely
proportional to their proxy attribution scores. Through such a reallocation of
unlearning power, GUARD mitigates unintended losses in retention. We provide
rigorous theoretical guarantees that GUARD significantly enhances retention
while maintaining forgetting metrics comparable to prior methods. Extensive
experiments on the TOFU benchmark across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate
that GUARD substantially improves utility preservation while ensuring effective
unlearning. Notably, GUARD reduces utility sacrifice on the Retain Set by up to
194.92% in terms of Truth Ratio when forgetting 10% of the training data.

*Boaz Lavon,Shahar Katz,Lior Wolf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为EG-CFG的新方法，通过实时执行信号指导语言模型生成代码，显著提升了代码生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型（LLMs）在生成代码时通常不利用执行反馈，而人类程序员会依赖这一关键信号。EG-CFG旨在填补这一空白。

Method: EG-CFG采用多阶段流程：1）通过束搜索采样候选代码行；2）执行测试用例提取执行信号；3）将信号动态整合到生成过程中。

Result: 实验表明，EG-CFG在多种编码任务中显著优于标准方法，实现了从基础问题到复杂编程任务的最先进性能。

Conclusion: EG-CFG通过动态整合执行信号，为代码生成提供了更高效的指导，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to neural code generation that incorporates
real-time execution signals into the language model generation process. While
large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive code generation
capabilities, they typically do not utilize execution feedback during
inference, a critical signal that human programmers regularly leverage. Our
method, Execution-Guided Classifier-Free Guidance (EG-CFG), dynamically
incorporates execution signals as the model generates code, providing
line-by-line feedback that guides the generation process toward executable
solutions. EG-CFG employs a multi-stage process: first, we conduct beam search
to sample candidate program completions for each line; second, we extract
execution signals by executing these candidates against test cases; and
finally, we incorporate these signals into the prompt during generation. By
maintaining consistent signals across tokens within the same line and
refreshing signals at line boundaries, our approach provides coherent guidance
while preserving syntactic structure. Moreover, the method naturally supports
native parallelism at the task level in which multiple agents operate in
parallel, exploring diverse reasoning paths and collectively generating a broad
set of candidate solutions. Our experiments across diverse coding tasks
demonstrate that EG-CFG significantly improves code generation performance
compared to standard approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results across
various levels of complexity, from foundational problems to challenging
competitive programming tasks. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 当前网络代理在处理复杂网页输入时存在困难，如处理庞大的DOM树或依赖截图增强信息，亟需一种专为代理优化的交互方式。

Method: 提出了AWI概念，并制定了六项设计原则，强调安全性、效率和标准化。

Result: AWI旨在克服现有界面的根本限制，为更高效、可靠和透明的网络代理设计铺平道路。

Conclusion: AWI的提出需要机器学习社区的广泛合作，以实现网络代理技术的进一步发展。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal
counterparts have spurred significant interest in developing web agents -- AI
systems capable of autonomously navigating and completing tasks within web
environments. While holding tremendous promise for automating complex web
interactions, current approaches face substantial challenges due to the
fundamental mismatch between human-designed interfaces and LLM capabilities.
Current methods struggle with the inherent complexity of web inputs, whether
processing massive DOM trees, relying on screenshots augmented with additional
information, or bypassing the user interface entirely through API interactions.
This position paper advocates for a paradigm shift in web agent research:
rather than forcing web agents to adapt to interfaces designed for humans, we
should develop a new interaction paradigm specifically optimized for agentic
capabilities. To this end, we introduce the concept of an Agentic Web Interface
(AWI), an interface specifically designed for agents to navigate a website. We
establish six guiding principles for AWI design, emphasizing safety,
efficiency, and standardization, to account for the interests of all primary
stakeholders. This reframing aims to overcome fundamental limitations of
existing interfaces, paving the way for more efficient, reliable, and
transparent web agent design, which will be a collaborative effort involving
the broader ML community.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReGuidance是一种简单的方法，用于提升基于扩散模型的逆问题求解算法的样本真实性和奖励效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在低信噪比的逆问题中容易偏离数据流形，导致输出不真实。

Method: 通过反转候选解并重新初始化DPS来改进样本质量。

Result: 在硬逆问题中显著提升样本质量和测量一致性。

Conclusion: ReGuidance首次为DPS提供了理论保证，并在实践中表现出色。

Abstract: There has been a flurry of activity around using pretrained diffusion models
as informed data priors for solving inverse problems, and more generally around
steering these models using reward models. Training-free methods like diffusion
posterior sampling (DPS) and its many variants have offered flexible heuristic
algorithms for these tasks, but when the reward is not informative enough,
e.g., in hard inverse problems with low signal-to-noise ratio, these techniques
veer off the data manifold, failing to produce realistic outputs. In this work,
we devise a simple wrapper, ReGuidance, for boosting both the sample realism
and reward achieved by these methods. Given a candidate solution $\hat{x}$
produced by an algorithm of the user's choice, we propose inverting the
solution by running the unconditional probability flow ODE in reverse starting
from $\hat{x}$, and then using the resulting latent as an initialization for
DPS. We evaluate our wrapper on hard inverse problems like large box
in-painting and super-resolution with high upscaling. Whereas state-of-the-art
baselines visibly fail, we find that applying our wrapper on top of these
baselines significantly boosts sample quality and measurement consistency. We
complement these findings with theory proving that on certain multimodal data
distributions, ReGuidance simultaneously boosts the reward and brings the
candidate solution closer to the data manifold. To our knowledge, this
constitutes the first rigorous algorithmic guarantee for DPS.

Method: 通过建立注意力机制与经典核方法的新联系，分析ICL在流形上的回归性能。

Result: 当训练任务足够多时，Transformer达到Hölder函数在流形上的极小极大回归率，误差随流形内蕴维度指数增长。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了几何在ICL中的作用，并为非线性模型的ICL研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: While in-context learning (ICL) has achieved remarkable success in natural
language and vision domains, its theoretical understanding--particularly in the
context of structured geometric data--remains unexplored. In this work, we
initiate a theoretical study of ICL for regression of H\"older functions on
manifolds. By establishing a novel connection between the attention mechanism
and classical kernel methods, we derive generalization error bounds in terms of
the prompt length and the number of training tasks. When a sufficient number of
training tasks are observed, transformers give rise to the minimax regression
rate of H\"older functions on manifolds, which scales exponentially with the
intrinsic dimension of the manifold, rather than the ambient space dimension.
Our result also characterizes how the generalization error scales with the
number of training tasks, shedding light on the complexity of transformers as
in-context algorithm learners. Our findings provide foundational insights into
the role of geometry in ICL and novels tools to study ICL of nonlinear models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小规模实验难以推广到大规模生产系统的问题，提高创新效率。

Method: 通过构建模型损失表面$L(N,D)$，Farseer比现有方法（如Chinchilla定律）更准确地拟合实验数据。

Result: Farseer显著降低了外推误差（433%），并提供了更优的计算分配策略。

Conclusion: Farseer为大规模语言模型训练提供了可靠的工具，支持开源以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is prohibitively expensive, creating a
critical scaling gap where insights from small-scale experiments often fail to
transfer to resource-intensive production systems, thereby hindering efficient
innovation. To bridge this, we introduce Farseer, a novel and refined scaling
law offering enhanced predictive accuracy across scales. By systematically
constructing a model loss surface $L(N,D)$, Farseer achieves a significantly
better fit to empirical data than prior laws (e.g., Chinchilla's law). Our
methodology yields accurate, robust, and highly generalizable predictions,
demonstrating excellent extrapolation capabilities, improving upon Chinchilla's
law by reducing extrapolation error by 433\%. This allows for the reliable
evaluation of competing training strategies across all $(N,D)$ settings,
enabling conclusions from small-scale ablation studies to be confidently
extrapolated to predict large-scale performance. Furthermore, Farseer provides
new insights into optimal compute allocation, better reflecting the nuanced
demands of modern LLM training. To validate our approach, we trained an
extensive suite of approximately 1,000 LLMs across diverse scales and
configurations, consuming roughly 3 million NVIDIA H100 GPU hours. We are
comprehensively open-sourcing all models, data, results, and logs at

Result: 神经算子能够学习PDEs的解决方案算子，适用于不同边界条件、系数函数和几何形状的物理系统。

Conclusion: 论文为实践者提供了将神经网络扩展为神经算子的实用指南，有望推动深度学习在科学问题中的应用。

Abstract: A wide range of scientific problems, such as those described by
continuous-time dynamical systems and partial differential equations (PDEs),
are naturally formulated on function spaces. While function spaces are
typically infinite-dimensional, deep learning has predominantly advanced
through applications in computer vision and natural language processing that
focus on mappings between finite-dimensional spaces. Such fundamental
disparities in the nature of the data have limited neural networks from
achieving a comparable level of success in scientific applications as seen in
other fields. Neural operators are a principled way to generalize neural
networks to mappings between function spaces, offering a pathway to replicate
deep learning's transformative impact on scientific problems. For instance,
neural operators can learn solution operators for entire classes of PDEs, e.g.,
physical systems with different boundary conditions, coefficient functions, and
geometries. A key factor in deep learning's success has been the careful
engineering of neural architectures through extensive empirical testing.
Translating these neural architectures into neural operators allows operator
learning to enjoy these same empirical optimizations. However, prior neural
operator architectures have often been introduced as standalone models, not
directly derived as extensions of existing neural network architectures. In
this paper, we identify and distill the key principles for constructing
practical implementations of mappings between infinite-dimensional function
spaces. Using these principles, we propose a recipe for converting several
popular neural architectures into neural operators with minimal modifications.
This paper aims to guide practitioners through this process and details the
steps to make neural operators work in practice. Our code can be found at

Motivation: 探讨扩散桥方法中不同损失函数的优化目标及其效果差异，以提升采样性能。

Method: 比较LV损失和rKL-LD损失在扩散桥方法中的应用，分析梯度计算和目标函数的等价性。

Result: 实验表明rKL-LD损失在性能和训练稳定性上优于LV损失，且需要更少的超参数优化。

Conclusion: rKL-LD损失在扩散桥方法中更具优势，建议替代LV损失以提升效果。

Abstract: Diffusion bridges are a promising class of deep-learning methods for sampling
from unnormalized distributions. Recent works show that the Log Variance (LV)
loss consistently outperforms the reverse Kullback-Leibler (rKL) loss when
using the reparametrization trick to compute rKL-gradients. While the on-policy
LV loss yields identical gradients to the rKL loss when combined with the
log-derivative trick for diffusion samplers with non-learnable forward
processes, this equivalence does not hold for diffusion bridges or when
diffusion coefficients are learned. Based on this insight we argue that for
diffusion bridges the LV loss does not represent an optimization objective that
can be motivated like the rKL loss via the data processing inequality. Our
analysis shows that employing the rKL loss with the log-derivative trick
(rKL-LD) does not only avoid these conceptual problems but also consistently
outperforms the LV loss. Experimental results with different types of diffusion
bridges on challenging benchmarks show that samplers trained with the rKL-LD
loss achieve better performance. From a practical perspective we find that
rKL-LD requires significantly less hyperparameter optimization and yields more
stable training behavior.

TL;DR: AniMaker是一个多智能体框架，通过高效生成多候选视频片段和故事感知的片段选择，解决了多场景和角色视频生成中的连贯性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成方法在生成多场景和角色的连贯故事视频时存在叙事不连贯和节奏问题，且模型的不稳定性可能导致整体质量下降。

Method: AniMaker采用多智能体框架，包括导演、摄影、评审和后制代理，结合MCTS-Gen和AniEval技术，优化片段生成和评估。

Result: 实验表明，AniMaker在VBench和AniEval等指标上表现优越，显著提升了多候选生成的效率和动画质量。

Conclusion: AniMaker通过智能片段生成和评估，推动了AI生成故事动画向生产标准的迈进。

Abstract: Despite rapid advancements in video generation models, generating coherent
storytelling videos that span multiple scenes and characters remains
challenging. Current methods often rigidly convert pre-generated keyframes into
fixed-length clips, resulting in disjointed narratives and pacing issues.
Furthermore, the inherent instability of video generation models means that
even a single low-quality clip can significantly degrade the entire output
animation's logical coherence and visual continuity. To overcome these
obstacles, we introduce AniMaker, a multi-agent framework enabling efficient
multi-candidate clip generation and storytelling-aware clip selection, thus
creating globally consistent and story-coherent animation solely from text
input. The framework is structured around specialized agents, including the
Director Agent for storyboard generation, the Photography Agent for video clip
generation, the Reviewer Agent for evaluation, and the Post-Production Agent
for editing and voiceover. Central to AniMaker's approach are two key technical
components: MCTS-Gen in Photography Agent, an efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS)-inspired strategy that intelligently navigates the candidate space to
generate high-potential clips while optimizing resource usage; and AniEval in
Reviewer Agent, the first framework specifically designed for multi-shot
animation evaluation, which assesses critical aspects such as story-level
consistency, action completion, and animation-specific features by considering
each clip in the context of its preceding and succeeding clips. Experiments
demonstrate that AniMaker achieves superior quality as measured by popular
metrics including VBench and our proposed AniEval framework, while
significantly improving the efficiency of multi-candidate generation, pushing
AI-generated storytelling animation closer to production standards.

Motivation: 研究动机是探索在有限博弈中，玩家无法获取对手效用信息（非耦合）但能利用辅助状态处理信息（高阶）的情况下，如何通过学习动态实现混合策略NE。

Method: 方法包括将非耦合学习与分散控制中的反馈稳定化关联，证明存在高阶非耦合学习动态能局部收敛到完全混合策略NE，并通过控制理论概念分析学习动态的局限性。

Result: 结果表明，对于具有孤立完全混合策略NE的有限博弈，存在高阶非耦合学习动态能局部收敛到该NE，但学习动态不具备普适性。此外，ABR属性与高阶学习动态的内部稳定性相关。

Conclusion: 结论包括ABR属性为学习动态提供了自然限制条件，并在特定条件下与NE兼容。同时，论文还探讨了在bandit设置下通过高阶复制动态学习混合策略NE的可能性。

Abstract: We study learnability of mixed-strategy Nash Equilibrium (NE) in general
finite games using higher-order replicator dynamics as well as classes of
higher-order uncoupled heterogeneous dynamics. In higher-order uncoupled
learning dynamics, players have no access to utilities of opponents (uncoupled)
but are allowed to use auxiliary states to further process information
(higher-order). We establish a link between uncoupled learning and feedback
stabilization with decentralized control. Using this association, we show that
for any finite game with an isolated completely mixed-strategy NE, there exist
higher-order uncoupled learning dynamics that lead (locally) to that NE. We
further establish the lack of universality of learning dynamics by linking
learning to the control theoretic concept of simultaneous stabilization. We
construct two games such that any higher-order dynamics that learn the
completely mixed-strategy NE of one of these games can never learn the
completely mixed-strategy NE of the other. Next, motivated by imposing natural
restrictions on allowable learning dynamics, we introduce the Asymptotic Best
Response (ABR) property. Dynamics with the ABR property asymptotically learn a
best response in environments that are asymptotically stationary. We show that
the ABR property relates to an internal stability condition on higher-order
learning dynamics. We provide conditions under which NE are compatible with the
ABR property. Finally, we address learnability of mixed-strategy NE in the
bandit setting using a bandit version of higher-order replicator dynamics.

Motivation: 联邦音频分类面临数据异构性、模型异构性和数据中毒三大挑战，现有方法缺乏统一的解决方案。

Method: 提出FedMLAC框架，采用双模型架构（个性化本地模型和轻量级全局插件模型），结合双向知识蒸馏和层剪枝聚合策略。

Result: 在多个音频分类基准测试中，FedMLAC在分类准确性和抗噪性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FedMLAC为联邦音频分类提供了一个高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) provides a privacy-preserving paradigm for training
audio classification (AC) models across distributed clients without sharing raw
data. However, Federated Audio Classification (FedAC) faces three critical
challenges that substantially hinder performance: data heterogeneity, model
heterogeneity, and data poisoning. While prior works have attempted to address
these issues, they are typically treated independently, lacking a unified and
robust solution suited to real-world federated audio scenarios. To bridge this
gap, we propose FedMLAC, a unified mutual learning framework designed to
simultaneously tackle these challenges in FedAC. Specifically, FedMLAC
introduces a dual-model architecture on each client, comprising a personalized
local AC model and a lightweight, globally shared Plug-in model. Through
bidirectional knowledge distillation, the Plug-in model enables global
knowledge transfer while adapting to client-specific data distributions, thus
supporting both generalization and personalization. To further enhance
robustness against corrupted audio data, we develop a Layer-wise Pruning
Aggregation (LPA) strategy that filters unreliable Plug-in model updates based
on parameter deviations during server-side aggregation. Extensive experiments
on four diverse audio classification benchmarks, spanning both speech and
non-speech tasks, demonstrate that FedMLAC consistently outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy and robustness to
noisy data.

Abstract: We present a method for fine-grained control over music generation through
inference-time interventions on an autoregressive generative music transformer
called MusicGen. Our approach enables timbre transfer, style transfer, and
genre fusion by steering the residual stream using weights of linear probes
trained on it, or by steering the attention layer activations in a similar
manner. We observe that modelling this as a regression task provides improved
performance, hypothesizing that the mean-squared-error better preserve
meaningful directional information in the activation space. Combined with the
global conditioning offered by text prompts in MusicGen, our method provides
both global and local control over music generation. Audio samples illustrating
our method are available at our demo page.

Abstract: Discrete audio tokens are compact representations that aim to preserve
perceptual quality, phonetic content, and speaker characteristics while
enabling efficient storage and inference, as well as competitive performance
across diverse downstream tasks.They provide a practical alternative to
continuous features, enabling the integration of speech and audio into modern

reviewed the latest progress in the field. However, existing studies often
focus on specific domains or tasks and lack a unified comparison across various
benchmarks. This paper presents a systematic review and benchmark of discrete
audio tokenizers, covering three domains: speech, music, and general audio. We
propose a taxonomy of tokenization approaches based on encoder-decoder,
quantization techniques, training paradigm, streamability, and application
domains. We evaluate tokenizers on multiple benchmarks for reconstruction,
downstream performance, and acoustic language modeling, and analyze trade-offs
through controlled ablation studies. Our findings highlight key limitations,
practical considerations, and open challenges, providing insight and guidance
for future research in this rapidly evolving area. For more information,

TL;DR: 本文研究了如何优化音频编码器与大型语言模型（LLM）的交互，通过架构设计提升音频信息的跨模态传递效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管音频-LLM的应用开发进展迅速，但其底层机制（如语义表示的高效传递）仍未被充分探索。

Method: 从标准架构出发，提出并评估了多种改进方案，包括延迟音频集成、仅通过注意力子模块探测音频表示，以及集成多样音频编码器。

Result: 实验表明，改进后的架构在5.6百万音频-文本对数据集上实现了10%至60%的相对性能提升。

Conclusion: 通过系统优化架构设计，显著提升了音频-LLM的跨模态信息传递能力。

Abstract: The integration of audio perception capabilities into Large Language Models
(LLMs) has enabled significant advances in Audio-LLMs. Although
application-focused developments, particularly in curating training data for
specific capabilities e.g., audio reasoning, have progressed rapidly, the
underlying mechanisms that govern efficient transfer of rich semantic
representations from audio encoders to LLMs remain under-explored. We
conceptualize effective audio-LLM interaction as the LLM's ability to
proficiently probe the audio encoder representations to satisfy textual
queries. This paper presents a systematic investigation on how architectural
design choices can affect that. Beginning with a standard Pengi/LLaVA-style
audio-LLM architecture, we propose and evaluate several modifications guided by
hypotheses derived from mechanistic interpretability studies and LLM
operational principles. Our experiments demonstrate that: (1) delaying audio
integration until the LLM's initial layers establish textual context that
enhances its ability to probe the audio representations for relevant
information; (2) the LLM can proficiently probe audio representations
exclusively through LLM layer's attention submodule, without requiring
propagation to its Feed-Forward Network (FFN) submodule; (3) an efficiently
integrated ensemble of diverse audio encoders provides richer, complementary
representations, thereby broadening the LLM's capacity to probe a wider
spectrum of audio information. All hypotheses are evaluated using an identical
three-stage training curriculum on a dataset of 5.6 million audio-text pairs,
ensuring controlled comparisons. Our final architecture, which incorporates all
proposed modifications, achieves relative improvements from 10\% to 60\% over
the baseline, validating our approach to optimizing cross-modal information
transfer in audio-LLMs. Project page: https://ta012.github.io/PAL/

Abstract: Spatial Semantic Segmentation of Sound Scenes (S5) aims to enhance
technologies for sound event detection and separation from multi-channel input
signals that mix multiple sound events with spatial information. This is a
fundamental basis of immersive communication. The ultimate goal is to separate
sound event signals with 6 Degrees of Freedom (6DoF) information into dry sound
object signals and metadata about the object type (sound event class) and
representing spatial information, including direction. However, because several
existing challenge tasks already provide some of the subset functions, this
task for this year focuses on detecting and separating sound events from
multi-channel spatial input signals. This paper outlines the S5 task setting of
the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) 2025
Challenge Task 4 and the DCASE2025 Task 4 Dataset, newly recorded and curated
for this task. We also report experimental results for an S5 system trained and
evaluated on this dataset. The full version of this paper will be published
after the challenge results are made public.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法BNMusic，通过将环境噪音融入个性化音乐中，减少噪音的感知，提升听觉体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的声音掩蔽技术需要增加音量来掩盖噪音，但效果有限且可能不协调。本文利用跨模态生成技术，提出一种更有效的方法。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：首先生成与噪音音乐特性匹配的个性化音乐，然后自适应放大音乐以增强掩蔽效果。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，BNMusic能有效减少噪音感知，提升听觉体验。

Conclusion: BNMusic框架通过个性化音乐生成和自适应放大，显著改善了噪音掩蔽效果。

Abstract: While being disturbed by environmental noises, the acoustic masking technique
is a conventional way to reduce the annoyance in audio engineering that seeks
to cover up the noises with other dominant yet less intrusive sounds. However,
misalignment between the dominant sound and the noise-such as mismatched
downbeats-often requires an excessive volume increase to achieve effective
masking. Motivated by recent advances in cross-modal generation, in this work,
we introduce an alternative method to acoustic masking, aiming to reduce the
noticeability of environmental noises by blending them into personalized music
generated based on user-provided text prompts. Following the paradigm of music
generation using mel-spectrogram representations, we propose a Blending Noises
into Personalized Music (BNMusic) framework with two key stages. The first
stage synthesizes a complete piece of music in a mel-spectrogram representation
that encapsulates the musical essence of the noise. In the second stage, we
adaptively amplify the generated music segment to further reduce noise
perception and enhance the blending effectiveness, while preserving auditory
quality. Our experiments with comprehensive evaluations on MusicBench,
EPIC-SOUNDS, and ESC-50 demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework,
highlighting the ability to blend environmental noise with rhythmically
aligned, adaptively amplified, and enjoyable music segments, minimizing the
noticeability of the noise, thereby improving overall acoustic experiences.

Result: 框架使神经形态控制系统的分析和设计适用于成熟的控制理论方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为神经形态控制系统的理论化和实际应用提供了可能。

Abstract: Neuromorphic control is receiving growing attention due to the multifaceted
advantages it brings over more classical control approaches, including: sparse
and on-demand sensing, information transmission, and actuation;
energy-efficient designs and realizations in neuromorphic hardware; event-based
signal processing and control signal computation. However, a general
control-theoretical formalization of what "neuromorphic control systems" are
and how we can rigorously analyze, design, and control them is still largely
missing. In this note, we suggest a possible path toward formalizing
neuromorphic control systems. We apply the proposed framework to a rhythmic
control case study and rigorously show how it has the potential to make
neuromorphic control systems analysis and design amenable to mature control
theoretical approaches like describing function analysis and harmonic balance,
fast-slow analysis, discrete and hybrid systems, and robust optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低温环境下，电池电量低时，HVAC和电池预热会消耗大量能量，影响续航里程。传统启发式规则导致能量利用不充分，亟需一种动态优化方法。

Method: 采用实时模型预测控制（MPC）优化电池能量分配，平衡推进、HVAC和电池预热需求。

Result: 该方法能够动态优化能量分配，确保电池在到达目的地后可立即充电，同时兼顾热舒适性和电池健康。

Conclusion: 模型预测控制为自动驾驶电动汽车的能量管理提供了一种高效、动态的解决方案。

Abstract: In autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs), battery energy must be judiciously
allocated to satisfy primary propulsion demands and secondary auxiliary
demands, particularly the Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)
system. This becomes especially critical when the battery is in a low state of
charge under cold ambient conditions, and cabin heating and battery
preconditioning (prior to actual charging) can consume a significant percentage
of available energy, directly impacting the driving range. In such cases, one
usually prioritizes propulsion or applies heuristic rules for thermal
management, often resulting in suboptimal energy utilization. There is a
pressing need for a principled approach that can dynamically allocate battery
power in a way that balances thermal comfort, battery health and
preconditioning, along with range preservation. This paper attempts to address
this issue using real-time Model Predictive Control to optimize the power
consumption between the propulsion, HVAC, and battery temperature preparation
so that it can be charged immediately once the destination is reached.

Result: 仿真实验表明，该算法在有限能量下显著提高了观测精度。

Conclusion: 该算法为眼到手配置提供了一种高效的相机位置优化方法，适用于自动化制造任务。

Abstract: Visual servoing technology has been well developed and applied in many
automated manufacturing tasks, especially in tools' pose alignment. To access a
full global view of tools, most applications adopt eye-to-hand configuration or
eye-to-hand/eye-in-hand cooperation configuration in an automated manufacturing
environment. Most research papers mainly put efforts into developing control
and observation architectures in various scenarios, but few of them have
discussed the importance of the camera's location in eye-to-hand configuration.
In a manufacturing environment, the quality of camera estimations may vary
significantly from one observation location to another, as the combined effects
of environmental conditions result in different noise levels of a single image
shot at different locations. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for the
camera's moving policy so that it explores the camera workspace and searches
for the optimal location where the images' noise level is minimized. Also, this
algorithm ensures the camera ends up at a suboptimal (if the optimal one is
unreachable) location among the locations already searched, with limited energy
available for moving the camera. Unlike a simple brute force approach, the
algorithm enables the camera to explore space more efficiently by adapting the
search policy from learning the environment. With the aid of an image averaging
technique, this algorithm, in use of a solo camera, achieves the observation
accuracy in eye-to-hand configurations to a desirable extent without filtering
out high-frequency information in the original image. An automated
manufacturing application has been simulated and the results show the success
of this algorithm's improvement of observation precision with limited energy.

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够学习稳定的最优控制器，并通过仿真验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Infinite-time nonlinear optimal regulation control is widely utilized in
aerospace engineering as a systematic method for synthesizing stable
controllers. However, conventional methods often rely on linearization
hypothesis, while recent learning-based approaches rarely consider stability
guarantees. This paper proposes a learning-based framework to learn a stable
optimal controller for nonlinear optimal regulation problems. First, leveraging
the equivalence between Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) and
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, we improve the backward generation of
optimal examples (BGOE) method for infinite-time optimal regulation problems. A
state-transition-matrix-guided data generation method is then proposed to
efficiently generate a complete dataset that covers the desired state space.
Finally, we incorporate the Lyapunov stability condition into the learning
framework, ensuring the stability of the learned optimal policy by jointly
learning the optimal value function and control policy. Simulations on three
nonlinear optimal regulation problems show that the learned optimal policy
achieves near-optimal regulation control and the code is provided at

Result: 结果表明，该方法能够有效提取反馈切换律，并在多个切换仿射系统示例中验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 结论是提出的方法为非光滑CBF的合成提供了有效途径，适用于复杂的切换仿射系统。

Abstract: We study the problem of synthesizing non-smooth control barrier functions
(CBFs) for continuous-time switched affine systems. Switched affine systems are
defined by a set of affine dynamical modes, wherein the control consists of a
state-based switching signal that determines the current operating mode. The
control barrier functions seek to maintain the system state inside a control
invariant set that excludes a given set of unsafe states. We consider CBFs that
take the form of pointwise minima and maxima over a finite set of affine
functions. Our approach uses ideas from nonsmooth analysis to formulate
conditions for min- and max- affine control barrier functions. We show how a
feedback switching law can be extracted from a given CBF. Next, we show how to
automate the process of synthesizing CBFs given a system description through a
tree-search algorithm inspired by branch-and-cut methods from combinatorial
optimization. Finally, we demonstrate our approach on a series of interesting
examples of switched affine systems.

Abstract: This work proposes an automatic control solution for the operation of

quality of treated water for three resource recovery applications
(environmental, industrial, and agricultural water reuse). We then present an
output-feedback model predictive controller (Output MPC) that operates a plant
to produce water of specific quality class, while also producing sufficient
biogas to ensure nonpositive energy costs. The controller is demonstrated in
the long-term operation of a full-scale WWTP subjected to typical influent
loads and periodically changing quality targets. Our results provide a
proof-of-concept on the energy-autonomous operation of existing wastewater
treatment infrastructure with control strategies that are general enough to
accommodate a wide range of resource recovery objectives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AEB系统依赖车载传感器（如雷达和摄像头），在视线受阻时可能失效。V2X通信可提前获取遮挡车辆信息，弥补传感器不足。

Method: 设计了两阶段刹车系统：基于V2X的部分刹车和传感器触发的AEB，并通过GIDAS数据库的模拟事故框架评估其性能。

Result: V2X增强的刹车系统比仅依赖传感器的AEB系统表现更优，碰撞避免能力显著提升。

Conclusion: V2X通信与传感器结合可有效提升自动驾驶车辆的碰撞避免能力，尤其在视线受阻场景中。

Abstract: By using an automated braking system, such as the Automatic Emergency Brake
(AEB), crashes can be avoided in situations where the driver is unaware of an
imminent collision. However, conventional AEB systems detect potential
collision adversaries with onboard sensor systems, such as radars and cameras,
that may fail in non-line-of-sight situations. By leveraging
vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, information regarding an approaching
vehicle can be received by the ego vehicle at an early point in time, even if
the opponent vehicle is occluded by a view obstruction. In this work, we
consider a 2-stage braking cascade, consisting of a partial brake, triggered
based on V2X information, and a sensor-triggered AEB. We evaluate its crash
avoidance performance in real-world crash situations extracted from the German
In-Depth Accident Study (GIDAS) database using an accident simulation
framework. The results are compared against a sensor-triggered AEB system and a
purely V2X-triggered partial brake. To further analyze the results, we identify
the crash cause for each situation in which the brake function under test could
not prevent the crash. The simulation results show a high added benefit of the
V2X-enhanced braking systems compared to the exclusive use of visual-based
sensor systems for automated collision prevention.

Abstract: This paper presents a joint system modeling approach for fault simulation of
all-electric auxiliary power unit (APU), integrating starter/generator
turn-to-turn short circuit (TTSC) faults with gas generator gas-path faults.To
address challenges in electromechanical coupling, simulation precision and
computational efficiency balance, we propose a multi-rate continuous-discrete
hybrid simulation architecture. This architecture treats the starter/generator
as a continuous system with variable step size in Simulink, while modeling the
gas generator as a discrete system with fixed step size in a dynamic-link
library (DLL) environment. For the starter/generator fault modeling, a
multi-loop approach is deployed to accurately simulate TTSC faults. For the gas
generator, we develop an improved GasTurb-DLL modeling method (IGDM) that
enhances uncertainty modeling, state-space representation, and tool chain
compatibility. Finally, the proposed methodology above was implemented in a
case study based on the APS5000 all-electric APU structure and parameters.
Model validation was conducted by comparing simulation results--covering
steady-state, transients, healthy, and fault conditions--with reference data
from third-party software and literature. The close agreement confirms both the
model's accuracy and the effectiveness of our modeling methodology. This work
establishes a modeling foundation for investigating the opportunities and
challenges in fault detection and isolation (FDI) brought by the all
electrification of the APU, including joint fault estimation and diagnosis,

Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) for tracking is a recently introduced
approach, which extends standard MPC formulations by incorporating an
artificial reference as an additional optimization variable, in order to track
external and potentially time-varying references. In this work, we analyze the
performance of such an MPC for tracking scheme without a terminal cost and
terminal constraints. We derive a transient performance estimate, i.e. a bound
on the closed-loop performance over an arbitrary time interval, yielding
insights on how to select the scheme's parameters for performance. Furthermore,
we show that in the asymptotic case, where the prediction horizon and observed
time interval tend to infinity, the closed-loop solution of MPC for tracking
recovers the infinite horizon optimal solution.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在复杂STL任务中表现出高效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: We propose a variant of the Rapidly Exploring Random Tree Star
(RRT$^{\star}$) algorithm to synthesize trajectories satisfying a given
spatio-temporal specification expressed in a fragment of Signal Temporal Logic
(STL) for linear systems. Previous approaches for planning trajectories under
STL specifications using sampling-based methods leverage either mixed-integer
or non-smooth optimization techniques, with poor scalability in the horizon and
complexity of the task. We adopt instead a control-theoretic perspective on the
problem, based on the notion of set forward invariance. Specifically, from a
given STL task defined over polyhedral predicates, we develop a novel
algorithmic framework by which the task is efficiently encoded into a
time-varying set via linear programming, such that trajectories evolving within
the set also satisfy the task. Forward invariance properties of the resulting
set with respect to the system dynamics and input limitations are then proved
via non-smooth analysis. We then present a modified RRT$^{\star}$ algorithm to
synthesize asymptotically optimal and dynamically feasible trajectories
satisfying a given STL specification, by sampling a tree of trajectories within
the previously constructed time-varying set. We showcase two use cases of our
approach involving an autonomous inspection of the International Space Station
and room-servicing task requiring timed revisit of a charging station.

Abstract: It is a challenging problem to jointly optimize the base station (BS)
precoding matrix and the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) phases
simultaneously in a RIS-assisted multiple-user multiple-input-multiple-output
(MU-MIMO) scenario when the size of the RIS becomes extremely large. In this
paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm called sequential
multi-agent advantage actor-critic (A2C) to solve this problem. In addition,
the discrete phase of RISs, imperfect channel state information (CSI), and
channel correlations between users are taken into consideration. The
computational complexity is also analyzed, and the performance of the proposed
algorithm is compared with the zero-forcing (ZF) beamformer in terms of the sum
spectral efficiency (SE). It is noted that the computational complexity of the
proposed algorithm is lower than the benchmark, while the performance is better
than the benchmark. Throughout simulations, it is also found that the proposed
algorithm is robust to medium channel estimation error.

Abstract: This paper presents a scenario based robust optimization framework for short
term energy scheduling in electricity intensive industrial plants, explicitly
addressing uncertainty in planning decisions. The model is formulated as a
two-stage Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) and integrates a hybrid scenario
generation method capable of representing uncertain inputs such as electricity
prices, renewable generation, and internal demand. A convex objective function
combining expected and worst case operational costs allows for tunable risk
aversion, enabling planners to balance economic performance and robustness. The
resulting schedule ensures feasibility across all scenarios and supports
coordinated use of industrial flexibility assets, including battery energy
storage and shiftable production. To isolate the effects of market volatility,
the framework is applied to a real world cement manufacturing case study
considering only day-ahead electricity price uncertainty, with all other inputs
treated deterministically. Results show improved resilience to forecast
deviations, reduced cost variability, and more consistent operations. The
proposed method offers a scalable and risk-aware approach for industrial
flexibility planning under uncertainty.

Abstract: Various domains such as power system stability analysis, electric machine
modeling, and control of power electronic converters have significantly
benefited from the application of coordinate transformations. One of the main
benefits is the dimensional reduction, which reduces the complexity of the
problems. This paper introduces a novel general transformation based on a
geometric framework that directly identifies the plane containing the locus for
unbalanced quantities through bivector analysis using Geometric Algebra. The
proposed method provides a direct transformation valid for any degree of
unbalance in $n$-phase, $(n+1)$-wire sinusoidal systems. The transformation
requires only two measurements (voltage or current) taken at different time
instants, making it computationally efficient. Moreover, we demonstrate through
pure geometric reasoning that our approach is general and encompasses other
techniques, such as the classical Clarke transformation. Numerical simulations
and experimental validation using a real-time digital simulator and a physical
laboratory setup demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. This
generalization to multi-dimensional systems, combined with the reduced
measurement requirements, represents a significant advancement over existing
approaches that are typically restricted to three-phase applications or suffer
from computational limitations.

Abstract: Theory and methods to obtain parametric reduced-order models by moment
matching are presented. The definition of the parametric moment is introduced,
and methods (model-based and data-driven) for the approximation of the
parametric moment of linear and nonlinear parametric systems are proposed.
These approximations are exploited to construct families of parametric
reduced-order models that match the approximate parametric moment of the system
to be reduced and preserve key system properties such as asymptotic stability
and dissipativity. The use of the model reduction methods is illustrated by
means of a parametric benchmark model for the linear case and a large-scale
wind farm model for the nonlinear case. In the illustration, a comparison of
the proposed approximation methods is drawn and their advantages/disadvantages
are discussed.
