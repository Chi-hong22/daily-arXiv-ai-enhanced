### [1] [Hybrid Deep Learning for Hyperspectral Single Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00033)
*Usman Muhammad,Jorma Laaksonen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SSUF模块和空间-光谱梯度损失函数，用于提升高光谱单图像超分辨率的空间细节恢复和光谱保真度，在降低模型复杂度的同时实现竞争性性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱单图像超分辨率任务在恢复精细空间细节和保持宽波长范围光谱保真度方面存在挑战，传统深度学习模型性能受限。

Method: 提出SSUF模块，结合光谱解混和光谱-空间特征提取，指导基于ResNet的CNN进行改进重建；设计空间-光谱梯度损失函数，整合均方误差与空间和光谱梯度分量。

Result: 在三个公开遥感高光谱数据集上的实验表明，所提出的混合深度学习模型在降低模型复杂度的同时实现了竞争性性能。

Conclusion: SSUF模块和空间-光谱梯度损失函数能有效提升高光谱超分辨率的空间和光谱重建质量，同时保持模型简洁性。

Abstract: Hyperspectral single image super-resolution (SISR) is a challenging task due
to the difficulty of restoring fine spatial details while preserving spectral
fidelity across a wide range of wavelengths, which limits the performance of
conventional deep learning models. To address this challenge, we introduce
Spectral-Spatial Unmixing Fusion (SSUF), a novel module that can be seamlessly
integrated into standard 2D convolutional architectures to enhance both spatial
resolution and spectral integrity. The SSUF combines spectral unmixing with
spectral--spatial feature extraction and guides a ResNet-based convolutional
neural network for improved reconstruction. In addition, we propose a custom
Spatial-Spectral Gradient Loss function that integrates mean squared error with
spatial and spectral gradient components, encouraging accurate reconstruction
of both spatial and spectral features. Experiments on three public remote
sensing hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that the proposed hybrid deep
learning model achieves competitive performance while reducing model
complexity.

### [2] [Review of Hallucination Understanding in Large Language and Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00034)
*Zhengyi Ho,Siyuan Liang,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一的多层次框架来表征图像和文本幻觉，通过任务-模态交织方法将幻觉与模型生命周期中的特定机制联系起来，揭示了幻觉源于数据分布中的可预测模式和继承偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言和视觉模型在现实应用中的广泛采用使得解决幻觉问题变得紧迫，这些错误可能在部署过程中传播错误信息，造成财务和运营损害。当前对幻觉的理解仍不完整和碎片化，需要建立统一框架。

Method: 提出了统一的多层次框架来表征图像和文本幻觉，采用任务-模态交织方法将幻觉与模型生命周期中的特定机制联系起来。

Result: 研究发现幻觉通常源于数据分布中的可预测模式和继承偏见，通过深入理解为开发更稳健的解决方案奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 该调查为在现实世界生成AI系统中开发更稳健有效的幻觉解决方案提供了基础，通过统一框架减少概念碎片化，促进更集成的理解。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of large language and vision models in real-world
applications has made urgent the need to address hallucinations -- instances
where models produce incorrect or nonsensical outputs. These errors can
propagate misinformation during deployment, leading to both financial and
operational harm. Although much research has been devoted to mitigating
hallucinations, our understanding of it is still incomplete and fragmented.
Without a coherent understanding of hallucinations, proposed solutions risk
mitigating surface symptoms rather than underlying causes, limiting their
effectiveness and generalizability in deployment. To tackle this gap, we first
present a unified, multi-level framework for characterizing both image and text
hallucinations across diverse applications, aiming to reduce conceptual
fragmentation. We then link these hallucinations to specific mechanisms within
a model's lifecycle, using a task-modality interleaved approach to promote a
more integrated understanding. Our investigations reveal that hallucinations
often stem from predictable patterns in data distributions and inherited
biases. By deepening our understanding, this survey provides a foundation for
developing more robust and effective solutions to hallucinations in real-world
generative AI systems.

### [3] [On Robustness of Vision-Language-Action Model against Multi-Modal Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00037)
*Jianing Guo,Zhenhong Wu,Chang Tu,Yiyao Ma,Xiangqi Kong,Zhiqian Liu,Jiaming Ji,Shuning Zhang,Yuanpei Chen,Kai Chen,Xianglong Liu,Qi Dou,Yaodong Yang,Huijie Zhao,Weifeng Lv,Simin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了RobustVLA方法，针对VLA模型在动作、指令、环境和观察等多模态扰动下的鲁棒性问题，通过离线鲁棒优化和输入一致性增强，显著提升了模型在各种扰动下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型主要针对简单的视觉扰动，忽略了动作、指令、环境和观察等多模态扰动，导致在真实世界部署时鲁棒性不足。

Method: 1) 输出鲁棒性：采用离线鲁棒优化，对抗最坏情况的动作噪声；2) 输入鲁棒性：强制输入变化时保持动作一致性；3) 多扰动处理：将鲁棒性建模为多臂老虎机问题，使用上置信界算法自动识别最有害噪声。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，RobustVLA在pi0骨干网络上获得12.6%绝对提升，在OpenVLA骨干网络上获得10.4%绝对提升，推理速度比现有视觉鲁棒VLA快50.6倍，在混合扰动下提升10.4%。在真实FR5机器人上，四模态扰动下获得65.6%绝对提升。

Conclusion: RobustVLA有效解决了VLA模型在多模态扰动下的鲁棒性问题，在仿真和真实机器人上都表现出显著性能提升，为VLA模型的真实世界部署提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: In Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, robustness to real-world
perturbations is critical for deployment. Existing methods target simple visual
disturbances, overlooking the broader multi-modal perturbations that arise in
actions, instructions, environments, and observations. Here, we first evaluate
the robustness of mainstream VLAs under 17 perturbations across four
modalities. We find (1) actions as the most fragile modality, (2) Existing
visual-robust VLA do not gain robustness in other modality, and (3) pi0
demonstrates superior robustness with a diffusion-based action head. To build
multi-modal robust VLAs, we propose RobustVLA against perturbations in VLA
inputs and outputs. For output robustness, we perform offline robust
optimization against worst-case action noise that maximizes mismatch in flow
matching objective. This can be seen as adversarial training, label smoothing,
and outlier penalization. For input robustness, we enforce consistent actions
across input variations that preserve task semantics. To account for multiple
perturbations, we formulate robustness as a multi-armed bandit problem and
apply an upper confidence bound algorithm to automatically identify the most
harmful noise. Experiments on LIBERO demonstrate our RobustVLA delivers
absolute gains over baselines of 12.6% on the pi0 backbone and 10.4% on the
OpenVLA backbone across all 17 perturbations, achieving 50.6x faster inference
than existing visual-robust VLAs, and a 10.4% gain under mixed perturbations.
Our RobustVLA is particularly effective on real-world FR5 robot with limited
demonstrations, showing absolute gains by 65.6% under perturbations of four
modalities.

### [4] [Uncovering Intrinsic Capabilities: A Paradigm for Data Curation in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00040)
*Junjie Li,Ziao Wang,Jianghong Ma,Xiaofeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CADC框架通过无监督发现模型内在能力，基于梯度学习轨迹和影响力估计来筛选训练数据，仅用5%数据就能超越全数据训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统指令调优方法将模型视为黑盒，忽视其潜在学习能力，导致数据预算减少时性能下降。

Method: 无监督发现内在能力，通过梯度学习轨迹分析能力，使用影响力估计将数据与能力关联，设计能力感知的课程学习策略。

Result: 仅使用5%原始数据就在多模态基准测试中超越全数据训练效果。

Conclusion: 内在能力是模型学习的基本构建块，CADC为指令数据筛选提供了原则性范式。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) achieve strong benchmark performance, but
controlling their behavior through instruction tuning remains difficult.
Reducing the budget of instruction tuning dataset often causes regressions, as
heuristic strategies treat models as black boxes and overlook the latent
capabilities that govern learning. We introduce Capability-Attributed Data
Curation (CADC), a framework that shifts curation from task-specific heuristics
to intrinsic capability analysis. CADC discovers intrinsic capabilities in an
unsupervised manner from gradient-based learning trajectories, attributes
training data to these capabilities via influence estimation, and curates
capability-aware curricula through balanced selection and staged sequencing.
This transforms black-box instruction tuning into a controllable,
capability-driven process. With as little as 5% of the original data, CADC
surpasses full-data training on multimodal benchmarks. These results validate
intrinsic capabilities as the fundamental building blocks of model learning and
establish CADC as a principle paradigm for instruction data curation.

### [5] [Culture In a Frame: C$^3$B as a Comic-Based Benchmark for Multimodal Culturally Awareness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00041)
*Yuchen Song,Andong Chen,Wenxin Zhu,Kehai Chen,Xuefeng Bai,Muyun Yang,Tiejun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了C³B基准，这是一个多文化、多任务、多语言的文化意识能力基准，包含2000多张图片和18000多个QA对，用于评估多模态大语言模型的文化意识能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试在任务设计上缺乏难度递进，且缺少跨语言任务，同时真实世界图像通常只包含一种文化，使得基准相对容易。

Method: 构建包含三个难度递进任务的基准：从基础视觉识别到高级文化冲突理解，再到文化内容生成，使用漫画图像而非真实图像来增加文化多样性。

Result: 评估了11个开源MLLM，发现MLLM与人类表现之间存在显著性能差距，表明C³B对当前MLLM构成重大挑战。

Conclusion: C³B基准为MLLM的文化意识能力提供了有效评估工具，鼓励未来研究提升MLLM的文化意识能力。

Abstract: Cultural awareness capabilities has emerged as a critical capability for
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, current benchmarks lack
progressed difficulty in their task design and are deficient in cross-lingual
tasks. Moreover, current benchmarks often use real-world images. Each
real-world image typically contains one culture, making these benchmarks
relatively easy for MLLMs. Based on this, we propose C$^3$B ($\textbf{C}$omics
$\textbf{C}$ross-$\textbf{C}$ultural $\textbf{B}$enchmark), a novel
multicultural, multitask and multilingual cultural awareness capabilities
benchmark. C$^3$B comprises over 2000 images and over 18000 QA pairs,
constructed on three tasks with progressed difficulties, from basic visual
recognition to higher-level cultural conflict understanding, and finally to
cultural content generation. We conducted evaluations on 11 open-source MLLMs,
revealing a significant performance gap between MLLMs and human performance.
The gap demonstrates that C$^3$B poses substantial challenges for current
MLLMs, encouraging future research to advance the cultural awareness
capabilities of MLLMs.

### [6] [Beyond the Prompt: Gender Bias in Text-to-Image Models, with a Case Study on Hospital Professions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00045)
*Franck Vandewiele,Remi Synave,Samuel Delepoulle,Remi Cozot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究分析了6个先进的开源文本到图像模型在医疗职业性别表征方面的系统性偏见，发现所有模型都表现出职业刻板印象，但不同模型对提示词的敏感度差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像模型在专业、教育和创意环境中应用日益广泛，但其输出经常嵌入和放大社会偏见，特别是性别刻板印象，需要系统性地研究这些偏见的表现形式和程度。

Method: 使用6个开源模型（HunyuanImage 2.1、HiDream-I1-dev等），针对5个医院相关职业和5种肖像修饰词组合生成图像，每个组合生成100张图像进行分析。

Result: 所有模型都表现出系统性职业刻板印象：护士被完全描绘为女性，外科医生主要被描绘为男性。不同模型表现各异，Qwen-Image和SDXL强化男性主导，FLUX.1-dev偏向女性表征，提示词修饰语显著影响性别平衡。

Conclusion: 文本到图像模型中的性别偏见既是系统性的又是模型特定的，提示词措辞在塑造人口统计结果中起关键作用，需要偏见感知设计、平衡默认设置和用户指导来防止职业刻板印象的强化。

Abstract: Text-to-image (TTI) models are increasingly used in professional,
educational, and creative contexts, yet their outputs often embed and amplify
social biases. This paper investigates gender representation in six
state-of-the-art open-weight models: HunyuanImage 2.1, HiDream-I1-dev,
Qwen-Image, FLUX.1-dev, Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large, and Stable-Diffusion-XL.
Using carefully designed prompts, we generated 100 images for each combination
of five hospital-related professions (cardiologist, hospital director, nurse,
paramedic, surgeon) and five portrait qualifiers ("", corporate, neutral,
aesthetic, beautiful).
  Our analysis reveals systematic occupational stereotypes: all models produced
nurses exclusively as women and surgeons predominantly as men. However,
differences emerge across models: Qwen-Image and SDXL enforce rigid male
dominance, HiDream-I1-dev shows mixed outcomes, and FLUX.1-dev skews female in
most roles. HunyuanImage 2.1 and Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large also reproduce
gender stereotypes but with varying degrees of sensitivity to prompt
formulation. Portrait qualifiers further modulate gender balance, with terms
like corporate reinforcing male depictions and beautiful favoring female ones.
Sensitivity varies widely: Qwen-Image remains nearly unaffected, while
FLUX.1-dev, SDXL, and SD3.5 show strong prompt dependence.
  These findings demonstrate that gender bias in TTI models is both systematic
and model-specific. Beyond documenting disparities, we argue that prompt
wording plays a critical role in shaping demographic outcomes. The results
underscore the need for bias-aware design, balanced defaults, and user guidance
to prevent the reinforcement of occupational stereotypes in generative AI.

### [7] [Reinforcement Learning-Based Prompt Template Stealing for Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00046)
*Xiaotian Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RLStealer是一个基于强化学习的提示词反演框架，能够从少量示例图像中恢复提示词模板，显著降低了攻击成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示多模态大语言模型中提示词交易存在的安全风险，即提示词可能被窃取，这对新兴的MLLMs市场构成威胁。

Method: 将模板窃取视为顺序决策问题，使用基于相似度的反馈信号作为奖励函数，有效探索提示词空间。

Result: 在公开基准测试中取得最先进性能，将总攻击成本降至现有基线的13%以下，并能有效泛化到不同图像风格。

Conclusion: 研究强调了提示词交易中固有的安全威胁，为开发MLLMs市场保护标准奠定了基础。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have transformed text-to-image
workflows, allowing designers to create novel visual concepts with
unprecedented speed. This progress has given rise to a thriving prompt trading
market, where curated prompts that induce trademark styles are bought and sold.
Although commercially attractive, prompt trading also introduces a largely
unexamined security risk: the prompts themselves can be stolen.
  In this paper, we expose this vulnerability and present RLStealer, a
reinforcement learning based prompt inversion framework that recovers its
template from only a small set of example images. RLStealer treats template
stealing as a sequential decision making problem and employs multiple
similarity based feedback signals as reward functions to effectively explore
the prompt space. Comprehensive experiments on publicly available benchmarks
demonstrate that RLStealer gets state-of-the-art performance while reducing the
total attack cost to under 13% of that required by existing baselines. Our
further analysis confirms that RLStealer can effectively generalize across
different image styles to efficiently steal unseen prompt templates. Our study
highlights an urgent security threat inherent in prompt trading and lays the
groundwork for developing protective standards in the emerging MLLMs
marketplace.

### [8] [Explanation-Driven Counterfactual Testing for Faithfulness in Vision-Language Model Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00047)
*Sihao Ding,Santosh Vasa,Aditi Ramadwar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出EDCT方法，通过反事实测试自动验证视觉语言模型生成解释的忠实度，发现模型解释与预测因果因素之间存在显著不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型生成的解释听起来合理但可能不反映真实的预测驱动因素，这种可信度与忠实度不匹配带来技术和治理风险。

Method: EDCT方法：获取模型答案和解释→解析解释为可测试视觉概念→通过生成修复生成针对性反事实编辑→使用LLM辅助分析计算反事实一致性分数。

Result: 在120个OK-VQA示例和多个VLM上测试，EDCT揭示了显著的忠实度差距，并提供了监管对齐的审计证据。

Conclusion: EDCT能够有效识别模型解释中的忠实度问题，为模型可信度评估提供了自动化验证工具。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often produce fluent Natural Language
Explanations (NLEs) that sound convincing but may not reflect the causal
factors driving predictions. This mismatch of plausibility and faithfulness
poses technical and governance risks. We introduce Explanation-Driven
Counterfactual Testing (EDCT), a fully automated verification procedure for a
target VLM that treats the model's own explanation as a falsifiable hypothesis.
Given an image-question pair, EDCT: (1) obtains the model's answer and NLE, (2)
parses the NLE into testable visual concepts, (3) generates targeted
counterfactual edits via generative inpainting, and (4) computes a
Counterfactual Consistency Score (CCS) using LLM-assisted analysis of changes
in both answers and explanations. Across 120 curated OK-VQA examples and
multiple VLMs, EDCT uncovers substantial faithfulness gaps and provides
regulator-aligned audit artifacts indicating when cited concepts fail causal
tests.

### [9] [HiDe: Rethinking The Zoom-IN method in High Resolution MLLMs via Hierarchical Decoupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00054)
*Xianjie Liu,Yiman Hu,Yixiong Zou,Liang Wu,Jian Xu,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出HiDe框架，通过注意力解耦和布局保持解耦来解决MLLMs在高分辨率图像中的性能问题，主要原因是背景干扰而非物体大小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法认为MLLMs在高分辨率图像表现不佳是因为感知限制和小物体识别困难，但本文发现主要问题是复杂背景干扰。

Method: 提出分层解耦框架HiDe：1) Token-wise Attention Decoupling解耦问题token识别关键信息；2) Layout-Preserving Decoupling从背景中解耦目标区域并重建紧凑表示。

Result: 在V*Bench、HRBench4K和HRBench8K上达到新SOTA，Qwen2.5-VL 7B和InternVL3 8B分别达到92.1%和91.6%，比之前训练无关方法节省75%内存。

Conclusion: HiDe框架有效解决了MLLMs在高分辨率图像中的背景干扰问题，无需训练即可显著提升性能并减少内存使用。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant strides in
visual understanding tasks. However, their performance on high-resolution
images remains suboptimal. While existing approaches often attribute this
limitation to perceptual constraints and argue that MLLMs struggle to recognize
small objects, leading them to use "zoom in" strategies for better detail, our
analysis reveals a different cause: the main issue is not object size, but
rather caused by complex background interference. We systematically analyze
this "zoom in" operation through a series of decoupling experiments and propose
the Hierarchical Decoupling Framework (HiDe), a training-free framework that
uses Token-wise Attention Decoupling (TAD) to decouple the question tokens and
identify the key information tokens, then leverages their attention weights to
achieve precise alignment with the target visual regions. Subsequently, it
employs Layout-Preserving Decoupling (LPD) to decouple these regions from the
background and reconstructs a compact representation that preserves essential
spatial layouts while eliminating background interference. HiDe sets a new SOTA
on V*Bench, HRBench4K, and HRBench8K, boosting Qwen2.5-VL 7B and InternVL3 8B
to SOTA (92.1% and 91.6% on V*Bench), even surpassing RL methods. After
optimization, HiDe uses 75% less memory than the previous training-free
approach. Code is provided in https://github.com/Tennine2077/HiDe.

### [10] [FSDENet: A Frequency and Spatial Domains based Detail Enhancement Network for Remote Sensing Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00059)
*Jiahao Fu,Yinfeng Yu,Liejun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了FSDENet网络，通过结合空间域和频域信息来增强遥感图像分割中的细节处理能力，特别是在边界区域和灰度变化区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决遥感图像分割中因灰度变化（如阴影和低对比度区域）导致的语义边缘模糊问题，需要充分利用空间信息并增强细节处理能力。

Method: 使用空间处理方法提取多尺度空间特征和细粒度语义细节，通过FFT整合全局和频域信息，利用Haar小波变换分解特征为高低频分量来优化边界分割。

Result: 在LoveDA、Vaihingen、Potsdam和iSAID四个数据集上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: FSDENet通过空间粒度和频域边缘敏感性的双域协同，显著提高了边界区域和灰度过渡区域的分割精度。

Abstract: To fully leverage spatial information for remote sensing image segmentation
and address semantic edge ambiguities caused by grayscale variations (e.g.,
shadows and low-contrast regions), we propose the Frequency and Spatial Domains
based Detail Enhancement Network (FSDENet). Our framework employs spatial
processing methods to extract rich multi-scale spatial features and
fine-grained semantic details. By effectively integrating global and
frequency-domain information through the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in global
mappings, the model's capability to discern global representations under
grayscale variations is significantly strengthened. Additionally, we utilize
Haar wavelet transform to decompose features into high- and low-frequency
components, leveraging their distinct sensitivity to edge information to refine
boundary segmentation. The model achieves dual-domain synergy by integrating
spatial granularity with frequency-domain edge sensitivity, substantially
improving segmentation accuracy in boundary regions and grayscale transition
zones. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that FSDENet achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on four widely adopted datasets: LoveDA,
Vaihingen, Potsdam, and iSAID.

### [11] [Less is More: Lean yet Powerful Vision-Language Model for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00060)
*Sheng Yang,Tong Zhan,Guancheng Chen,Yanfeng Lu,Jian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 将自动驾驶重新概念化为广义语言，将轨迹规划任务建模为下一个路径点预测，提出单阶段端到端框架Max-V1，在nuScenes数据集上取得SOTA性能，提升超过30%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新思考自动驾驶问题，将其视为序列生成任务，利用VLM的生成能力直接从摄像头输入进行端到端轨迹预测。

Method: 基于统计建模的原则性监督策略，通过模仿学习从大规模专家演示中学习复杂驾驶策略，采用单次生成范式与驾驶的固有序列性对齐。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上达到最先进性能，相比基线提升超过30%，在跨域数据集上表现出优异的泛化性能和跨车辆鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这项工作提出了一个能够实现基本驾驶行为的模型，为开发更强大的自动驾驶智能体奠定了基础。

Abstract: In this work, we reconceptualize autonomous driving as a generalized language
and formulate the trajectory planning task as next waypoint prediction. We
introduce Max-V1, a novel framework for one-stage end-to-end autonomous
driving. Our framework presents a single-pass generation paradigm that aligns
with the inherent sequentiality of driving. This approach leverages the
generative capacity of the VLM (Vision-Language Model) to enable end-to-end
trajectory prediction directly from front-view camera input. The efficacy of
this method is underpinned by a principled supervision strategy derived from
statistical modeling. This provides a well-defined learning objective, which
makes the framework highly amenable to master complex driving policies through
imitation learning from large-scale expert demonstrations. Empirically, our
method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes dataset,
delivers an overall improvement of over 30% compared to prior baselines.
Furthermore, it exhibits superior generalization performance on cross-domain
datasets acquired from diverse vehicles, demonstrating notable potential for
cross-vehicle robustness and adaptability. Due to these empirical strengths,
this work introduces a model enabling fundamental driving behaviors, laying the
foundation for the development of more capable self-driving agents. Code will
be available upon publication.

### [12] [Efficient CNN Compression via Multi-method Low Rank Factorization and Feature Map Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00062)
*M. Kokhazadeh,G. Keramidas,V. Kelefouras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种端到端的CNN压缩设计空间探索框架，通过基于特征图相似性的秩选择策略、一次性微调过程和多种低秩分解技术的组合使用，实现了高效的神经网络压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统低秩分解方法面临秩选择困难、设计空间巨大、微调时间长、兼容性有限等问题，需要一种更高效的压缩框架来解决这些挑战。

Method: 基于特征图相似性的秩选择策略、一次性微调过程、支持卷积层和全连接层的多种低秩分解技术组合，以及端到端的设计空间探索框架。

Result: 在14个CNN模型和8个数据集上的实验表明，该方法实现了显著的压缩效果，精度损失最小，优于多种先进技术。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种高效的CNN压缩解决方案，通过组合多种低秩分解技术和智能秩选择策略，在保持精度的同时实现了更好的压缩效果。

Abstract: Low-Rank Factorization (LRF) is a widely adopted technique for compressing
deep neural networks (DNNs). However, it faces several challenges, including
optimal rank selection, a vast design space, long fine-tuning times, and
limited compatibility with different layer types and decomposition methods.
This paper presents an end-to-end Design Space Exploration (DSE) methodology
and framework for compressing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that
addresses all these issues. We introduce a novel rank selection strategy based
on feature map similarity, which captures non-linear interactions between layer
outputs more effectively than traditional weight-based approaches. Unlike prior
works, our method uses a one-shot fine-tuning process, significantly reducing
the overall fine-tuning time. The proposed framework is fully compatible with
all types of convolutional (Conv) and fully connected (FC) layers. To further
improve compression, the framework integrates three different LRF techniques
for Conv layers and three for FC layers, applying them selectively on a
per-layer basis. We demonstrate that combining multiple LRF methods within a
single model yields better compression results than using a single method
uniformly across all layers. Finally, we provide a comprehensive evaluation and
comparison of the six LRF techniques, offering practical insights into their
effectiveness across different scenarios. The proposed work is integrated into
TensorFlow 2.x, ensuring compatibility with widely used deep learning
workflows. Experimental results on 14 CNN models across eight datasets
demonstrate that the proposed methodology achieves substantial compression with
minimal accuracy loss, outperforming several state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: The evolution of the 5S methodology with the support of artificial
intelligence techniques represents a significant opportunity to improve
industrial organization audits in the automotive chain, making them more
objective, efficient and aligned with Industry 4.0 standards. This work
developed an automated 5S audit system based on large-scale language models
(LLM), capable of assessing the five senses (Seiri, Seiton, Seiso, Seiketsu,
Shitsuke) in a standardized way through intelligent image analysis. The
system's reliability was validated using Cohen's concordance coefficient (kappa
= 0.75), showing strong alignment between the automated assessments and the
corresponding human audits. The results indicate that the proposed solution
contributes significantly to continuous improvement in automotive manufacturing
environments, speeding up the audit process by 50% of the traditional time and
maintaining the consistency of the assessments, with a 99.8% reduction in
operating costs compared to traditional manual audits. The methodology
presented establishes a new paradigm for integrating lean systems with emerging
AI technologies, offering scalability for implementation in automotive plants
of different sizes.

TL;DR: 提出了OIG-Bench基准来评估多模态大语言模型在理解单图指南方面的能力，发现当前模型在语义理解和逻辑推理方面仍有显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型评估在单图指南理解方面探索不足，单图指南结合文本、图像和符号来呈现结构化信息，体现了人类感知和理解的特征。

Method: 开发了半自动标注流程，多个智能代理协作生成初步图像描述，辅助人类构建图像-文本对，构建了OIG-Bench基准并评估了29个最先进的MLLM。

Result: Qwen2.5-VL-72B在评估模型中表现最佳，总体准确率为77%，但所有模型在语义理解和逻辑推理方面都有显著弱点，多智能体标注系统在图像描述方面优于所有MLLM。

Conclusion: 当前多模态大语言模型在准确解释复杂视觉-文本关系方面仍存在困难，多智能体标注系统具有作为高质量图像描述生成器和未来数据集构建工具的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities. However, evaluating their capacity for human-like
understanding in One-Image Guides remains insufficiently explored. One-Image
Guides are a visual format combining text, imagery, and symbols to present
reorganized and structured information for easier comprehension, which are
specifically designed for human viewing and inherently embody the
characteristics of human perception and understanding. Here, we present
OIG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark focused on One-Image Guide understanding
across diverse domains. To reduce the cost of manual annotation, we developed a
semi-automated annotation pipeline in which multiple intelligent agents
collaborate to generate preliminary image descriptions, assisting humans in
constructing image-text pairs. With OIG-Bench, we have conducted a
comprehensive evaluation of 29 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both
proprietary and open-source models. The results show that Qwen2.5-VL-72B
performs the best among the evaluated models, with an overall accuracy of 77%.
Nevertheless, all models exhibit notable weaknesses in semantic understanding
and logical reasoning, indicating that current MLLMs still struggle to
accurately interpret complex visual-text relationships. In addition, we also
demonstrate that the proposed multi-agent annotation system outperforms all
MLLMs in image captioning, highlighting its potential as both a high-quality
image description generator and a valuable tool for future dataset
construction. Datasets are available at https://github.com/XiejcSYSU/OIG-Bench.

Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型在地理空间推理任务中的局限性，避免依赖成本高昂的人工推理标注，扩展地理空间建模从领域预训练/监督微调到推理优先的后训练范式。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1) 脚手架阶段：通过合成链式思维示例进行监督微调，建立地理空间思维范式；2) 提升阶段：使用GRPO强化学习在弱监督跨视图配对代理上训练，提供可验证的奖励信号。

Conclusion: Geo-R1成功将地理空间建模扩展到推理优先的后训练范式，证明了通过合成数据和强化学习可以有效解锁模型的地理空间推理能力。

Abstract: We introduce Geo-R1, a reasoning-centric post-training framework that unlocks
geospatial reasoning in vision-language models by combining thinking
scaffolding and elevating. In the scaffolding stage, Geo-R1 instills a
``geospatial thinking paradigm" via supervised fine-tuning on synthetic
chain-of-thought exemplars, enabling models to connect visual cues with
geographic priors without costly human reasoning annotations. In the elevating
stage, it uses GRPO-based reinforcement learning on a weakly-supervised
cross-view pairing proxy. This design supplies a verifiable and scalable reward
signal: teaching models to capture and reconcile features across modalities,
and harnessing reasoning for accurate prediction. Geo-R1 extends geospatial
modeling from domain pretraining / supervised finetuning to reasoning-first
post-training, and achieves state-of-the-art performance across various
geospatial reasoning benchmarks. Our model is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于无偏平滑神经元(USN)指标的神经网络剪枝方法，通过移除低USN值的神经元来减少过参数化，同时保持模型表达能力，并引入Wasserstein距离损失来优化剪枝过程，在鲁棒关键点检测任务上取得了优越的鲁棒性认证性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在视觉和机器人应用中广泛使用，但现有认证训练和鲁棒性认证方法面临过参数化问题，导致认证紧致性和可扩展性不足。需要解决神经网络对亮度、对比度等语义变换扰动的鲁棒性验证挑战。

Method: 首先分析层和神经元对输入扰动的稳定性和方差，提出USN指标来衡量可认证鲁棒性。基于USN设计剪枝方法，移除低USN神经元并保留高USN神经元。引入Wasserstein距离损失来确保剪枝后的神经元在层间分布更集中。

Conclusion: 基于USN指标的剪枝方法能有效解决神经网络过参数化问题，在保持模型表达能力的同时提升鲁棒性认证的紧致性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have been widely adopted in many vision and robotics
applications with visual inputs. It is essential to verify its robustness
against semantic transformation perturbations, such as brightness and contrast.
However, current certified training and robustness certification methods face
the challenge of over-parameterization, which hinders the tightness and
scalability due to the over-complicated neural networks. To this end, we first
analyze stability and variance of layers and neurons against input
perturbation, showing that certifiable robustness can be indicated by a
fundamental Unbiased and Smooth Neuron metric (USN). Based on USN, we introduce
a novel neural network pruning method that removes neurons with low USN and
retains those with high USN, thereby preserving model expressiveness without
over-parameterization. To further enhance this pruning process, we propose a
new Wasserstein distance loss to ensure that pruned neurons are more
concentrated across layers. We validate our approach through extensive
experiments on the challenging robust keypoint detection task, which involves
realistic brightness and contrast perturbations, demonstrating that our method
achieves superior robustness certification performance and efficiency compared
to baselines.

Motivation: 解决复杂现实环境中高光谱异常检测的挑战，特别是在缺乏先验知识的情况下识别与背景光谱特征不同的异常像素。

Method: 使用传输理论模型描述高光谱像素，将其视为模板模式的变形观测，在SCDT域中表示，然后采用无监督子空间建模技术构建背景信号模型。

Result: 在五个不同数据集上的综合评估表明，该方法优于现有最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 提出的基于传输理论的数学框架为高光谱异常检测提供了一种有效的新方法，在缺乏先验知识的情况下表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD), a crucial approach for many civilian
and military applications, seeks to identify pixels with spectral signatures
that are anomalous relative to a preponderance of background signatures.
Significant effort has been made to improve HAD techniques, but challenges
arise due to complex real-world environments and, by definition, limited prior
knowledge of potential signatures of interest. This paper introduces a novel
HAD method by proposing a transport-based mathematical model to describe the
pixels comprising a given hyperspectral image. In this approach, hyperspectral
pixels are viewed as observations of a template pattern undergoing unknown
deformations that enables their representation in the signed cumulative
distribution transform (SCDT) domain. An unsupervised subspace modeling
technique is then used to construct a model of abundant background signals in
this domain, whereupon anomalous signals are detected as deviations from the
learned model. Comprehensive evaluations across five distinct datasets
illustrate the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art
methods.

TL;DR: 提出了MOLM水印框架，通过LoRA适配器在生成模型中嵌入密钥相关扰动，实现鲁棒且可验证的图像水印，无需密钥特定重训练。


<details>

Motivation: 生成模型能大规模生成逼真图像，引发对检测合成图像和溯源来源的迫切需求。现有水印方法对真实失真脆弱、易被自适应移除，且密钥更新成本高。

Method: 提出基于路由的MOLM方法，使用二进制密钥激活残差和注意力块中的轻量级LoRA适配器，将编码问题建模为生成模型参数的密钥相关扰动。

Result: 在Stable Diffusion和FLUX上的实验表明，MOLM在保持图像质量的同时，对失真、压缩、再生、平均攻击和黑盒对抗攻击具有鲁棒的密钥恢复能力。

Conclusion: MOLM框架实现了不可感知性、保真度、可验证性和鲁棒性等理想特性，无需密钥特定重训练，为生成图像溯源提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generative models can generate photorealistic images at scale. This raises
urgent concerns about the ability to detect synthetically generated images and
attribute these images to specific sources. While watermarking has emerged as a
possible solution, existing methods remain fragile to realistic distortions,
susceptible to adaptive removal, and expensive to update when the underlying
watermarking key changes. We propose a general watermarking framework that
formulates the encoding problem as key-dependent perturbation of the parameters
of a generative model. Within this framework, we introduce Mixture of LoRA
Markers (MOLM), a routing-based instantiation in which binary keys activate
lightweight LoRA adapters inside residual and attention blocks. This design
avoids key-specific re-training and achieves the desired properties such as
imperceptibility, fidelity, verifiability, and robustness. Experiments on
Stable Diffusion and FLUX show that MOLM preserves image quality while
achieving robust key recovery against distortions, compression and
regeneration, averaging attacks, and black-box adversarial attacks on the
extractor.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开放世界检测方法存在已知与未知类别间的语义混淆和灾难性遗忘问题，导致未知召回率下降和已知类别准确率退化。

Method: 提出CROWD框架，包含CROWD-Discover（使用子模条件增益函数策略性挖掘未知实例）和CROWD-Learn（使用组合目标联合分离已知和未知表示，同时保持已知类别间的判别一致性）。

Result: 在OWOD基准测试中，CROWD在M-OWODB和S-OWODB上分别提升已知类别准确率2.83%和2.05%，未知召回率比领先基线提高近2.4倍。

Conclusion: CROWD通过组合式数据发现和表示学习方法，有效缓解了开放世界检测中的语义混淆和灾难性遗忘问题，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Open-World Object Detection (OWOD) enriches traditional object detectors by
enabling continual discovery and integration of unknown objects via human
guidance. However, existing OWOD approaches frequently suffer from semantic
confusion between known and unknown classes, alongside catastrophic forgetting,
leading to diminished unknown recall and degraded known-class accuracy. To
overcome these challenges, we propose Combinatorial Open-World Detection
(CROWD), a unified framework reformulating unknown object discovery and
adaptation as an interwoven combinatorial (set-based) data-discovery
(CROWD-Discover) and representation learning (CROWD-Learn) task. CROWD-Discover
strategically mines unknown instances by maximizing Submodular Conditional Gain
(SCG) functions, selecting representative examples distinctly dissimilar from
known objects. Subsequently, CROWD-Learn employs novel combinatorial objectives
that jointly disentangle known and unknown representations while maintaining
discriminative coherence among known classes, thus mitigating confusion and
forgetting. Extensive evaluations on OWOD benchmarks illustrate that CROWD
achieves improvements of 2.83% and 2.05% in known-class accuracy on M-OWODB and
S-OWODB, respectively, and nearly 2.4x unknown recall compared to leading
baselines.

Motivation: 虽然已有许多研究改进潜在扩散模型，但针对内在潜在空间改进的研究仍然稀缺，特别是在遥感应用领域。

Method: 使用双分支结构：一个分支通过卷积处理空间域输入，另一个分支通过2D Haar小波分解、卷积操作和逆DWT重建处理频域特征，最后合并为集成空间-频率表示。

Result: 在多个性能指标上的实验结果表明，该方法能有效增强潜在空间表示。

Conclusion: 提出的ExpDWT-VAE方法通过结合空间和频域特征，成功提升了VAE潜在空间表示的质量，特别适用于卫星图像处理。

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDM), a subclass of diffusion models, mitigate the
computational complexity of pixel-space diffusion by operating within a
compressed latent space constructed by Variational Autoencoders (VAEs),
demonstrating significant advantages in Remote Sensing (RS) applications.
Though numerous studies enhancing LDMs have been conducted, investigations
explicitly targeting improvements within the intrinsic latent space remain
scarce. This paper proposes an innovative perspective, utilizing the Discrete
Wavelet Transform (DWT) to enhance the VAE's latent space representation,
designed for satellite imagery. The proposed method, ExpDWT-VAE, introduces
dual branches: one processes spatial domain input through convolutional
operations, while the other extracts and processes frequency-domain features
via 2D Haar wavelet decomposition, convolutional operation, and inverse DWT
reconstruction. These branches merge to create an integrated spatial-frequency
representation, further refined through convolutional and diagonal Gaussian
mapping into a robust latent representation. We utilize a new satellite imagery
dataset housed by the TerraFly mapping system to validate our method.
Experimental results across several performance metrics highlight the efficacy
of the proposed method at enhancing latent space representation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轨迹预测方法假设理想观测历史，忽略了第一人称视角固有的感知伪影（遮挡、ID切换、跟踪漂移），导致模型鲁棒性不足。

Method: 提出BiFlow双流流匹配模型，同时去噪历史观测和预测未来运动；引入EgoAnchor机制通过特征调制将历史特征融入预测解码器。

Result: BiFlow在minADE和minFDE指标上平均降低10-15%，达到最先进性能，并表现出优越的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该基准和模型为开发真正适应现实世界第一人称感知挑战的轨迹预测系统提供了关键基础。

Abstract: Reliable trajectory prediction from an ego-centric perspective is crucial for
robotic navigation in human-centric environments. However, existing methods
typically assume idealized observation histories, failing to account for the
perceptual artifacts inherent in first-person vision, such as occlusions, ID
switches, and tracking drift. This discrepancy between training assumptions and
deployment reality severely limits model robustness. To bridge this gap, we
introduce EgoTraj-Bench, the first real-world benchmark that grounds noisy,
first-person visual histories in clean, bird's-eye-view future trajectories,
enabling robust learning under realistic perceptual constraints. Building on
this benchmark, we propose BiFlow, a dual-stream flow matching model that
concurrently denoises historical observations and forecasts future motion by
leveraging a shared latent representation. To better model agent intent, BiFlow
incorporates our EgoAnchor mechanism, which conditions the prediction decoder
on distilled historical features via feature modulation. Extensive experiments
show that BiFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing minADE and
minFDE by 10-15% on average and demonstrating superior robustness. We
anticipate that our benchmark and model will provide a critical foundation for
developing trajectory forecasting systems truly resilient to the challenges of
real-world, ego-centric perception.

Motivation: 准确解读胸部X光片是医学影像中的关键任务，需要比较监督方法和零样本VLM在诊断任务中的表现，探索如何充分发挥VLM的潜力。

Method: 在PneumoniaMNIST和Shenzhen TB两个数据集上，分别进行肺炎和结核病检测，对比监督CNN与BiomedCLIP VLM的性能，并通过验证集优化分类阈值进行校准。

Result: 校准后VLM性能显著提升：肺炎检测F1分数从低于CNN的0.8803提升到0.8841；结核病检测F1分数从0.4812大幅提升到0.7684，接近监督基线的0.7834。

Conclusion: 适当的校准对于发挥零样本VLM的诊断能力至关重要，使其能够匹敌甚至超越高效的任务特定监督模型。

Abstract: The accurate interpretation of chest radiographs using automated methods is a
critical task in medical imaging. This paper presents a comparative analysis
between a supervised lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a
state-of-the-art, zero-shot medical Vision-Language Model (VLM), BiomedCLIP,
across two distinct diagnostic tasks: pneumonia detection on the PneumoniaMNIST
benchmark and tuberculosis detection on the Shenzhen TB dataset. Our
experiments show that supervised CNNs serve as highly competitive baselines in
both cases. While the default zero-shot performance of the VLM is lower, we
demonstrate that its potential can be unlocked via a simple yet crucial remedy:
decision threshold calibration. By optimizing the classification threshold on a
validation set, the performance of BiomedCLIP is significantly boosted across
both datasets. For pneumonia detection, calibration enables the zero-shot VLM
to achieve a superior F1-score of 0.8841, surpassing the supervised CNN's
0.8803. For tuberculosis detection, calibration dramatically improves the
F1-score from 0.4812 to 0.7684, bringing it close to the supervised baseline's
0.7834. This work highlights a key insight: proper calibration is essential for
leveraging the full diagnostic power of zero-shot VLMs, enabling them to match
or even outperform efficient, task-specific supervised models.

Motivation: 现有的GUI代理方法要么截断历史记录，要么依赖简单的文本摘要，这在过去视觉细节对未来决策变得必要时会丢失关键信息。长时程任务中的记忆限制仍然是一个挑战。

Method: PAL-UI结合了双层级摘要代理（捕获观察级线索和行动级结果）和专用检索工具，使代理能够在规划过程中回忆特定的历史屏幕截图。基于Qwen2.5-VL训练了PAL-UI-3B和PAL-UI-7B模型。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了主动记忆检索对于基于视觉的GUI代理长时程规划能力的潜力。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) promise human-like interaction with software applications, yet
long-horizon tasks remain challenging due to memory limitations. Existing
approaches either truncate history or rely on simple textual summaries, which
risk losing critical information when past visual details become necessary for
future decisions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{PAL-UI} (\textbf{P}lanning
with \textbf{A}ctive \textbf{L}ook-back), a novel framework that enables GUI
agents to adaptively retrieve past observations when required. PAL-UI combines
a dual-level summarization agent, capturing both observation-level cues and
action-level outcomes, with a dedicated retrieval tool that allows the agent to
recall specific historical screenshots during planning. We curate a step-level
instruction dataset of 8.6K samples from mobile GUI navigation trajectories and
train \textbf{PAL-UI-3B} and \textbf{PAL-UI-7B} models based on Qwen2.5-VL.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that PAL-UI significantly outperforms
baseline models and prior methods in mobile GUI navigation tasks, even under
data-efficient settings. Moreover, PAL-UI exhibits strong cross-domain
generalization, achieving notable improvements in web navigation without
additional training. Our work highlights the potential of active memory
retrieval for long-horizon planning capabilities of vision-based GUI agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 迁移学习在医学影像中至关重要，但源数据集的选择往往依赖研究者直觉而非系统原则，这会影响算法的泛化能力和患者预后。

Method: 采用以人为中心的HCI视角，通过任务型调查与机器学习从业者进行访谈，分析他们选择源数据集的决策过程。

Result: 发现选择决策是任务依赖性的，受社区实践、数据集属性和计算或感知相似性影响，但相似性评分与预期性能并不总是一致。

Conclusion: 通过澄清这些启发式方法，为迁移学习中更系统的源选择提供了实用见解，建议需要更清晰的定义和HCI工具来支持决策。

Abstract: Transfer learning is crucial for medical imaging, yet the selection of source
datasets - which can impact the generalizability of algorithms, and thus
patient outcomes - often relies on researchers' intuition rather than
systematic principles. This study investigates these decisions through a
task-based survey with machine learning practitioners. Unlike prior work that
benchmarks models and experimental setups, we take a human-centered HCI
perspective on how practitioners select source datasets. Our findings indicate
that choices are task-dependent and influenced by community practices, dataset
properties, and computational (data embedding), or perceived visual or semantic
similarity. However, similarity ratings and expected performance are not always
aligned, challenging a traditional "more similar is better" view. Participants
often used ambiguous terminology, which suggests a need for clearer definitions
and HCI tools to make them explicit and usable. By clarifying these heuristics,
this work provides practical insights for more systematic source selection in
transfer learning.

Conclusion: 在脑膜瘤放疗规划等关键临床应用中，需要专门定制的分割解决方案，而非通用工具。

Abstract: Precise delineation of meningiomas is crucial for effective radiotherapy (RT)
planning, directly influencing treatment efficacy and preservation of adjacent
healthy tissues. While automated deep learning approaches have demonstrated
considerable potential, achieving consistently accurate clinical segmentation
remains challenging due to tumor heterogeneity. Interactive Medical Image
Segmentation (IMIS) addresses this challenge by integrating advanced AI
techniques with clinical input. However, generic segmentation tools, despite
widespread applicability, often lack the specificity required for clinically
critical and disease-specific tasks like meningioma RT planning. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce Interactive-MEN-RT, a dedicated IMIS tool
specifically developed for clinician-assisted 3D meningioma segmentation in RT
workflows. The system incorporates multiple clinically relevant interaction
methods, including point annotations, bounding boxes, lasso tools, and
scribbles, enhancing usability and clinical precision. In our evaluation
involving 500 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI scans from the BraTS 2025
Meningioma RT Segmentation Challenge, Interactive-MEN-RT demonstrated
substantial improvement compared to other segmentation methods, achieving Dice
similarity coefficients of up to 77.6\% and Intersection over Union scores of
64.8\%. These results emphasize the need for clinically tailored segmentation
solutions in critical applications such as meningioma RT planning. The code is

Method: 提出Code2Video框架，包含三个代理：规划器（结构化内容流和准备视觉资源）、编码器（将指令转换为可执行代码，采用范围引导自动修复）、评论器（使用视觉语言模型优化空间布局和清晰度）。

Result: 在MMMC基准测试中，Code2Video相比直接代码生成有40%的改进，生成的视频质量与人工制作的教程相当，特别是在TeachQuiz端到端评估指标上表现优异。

Conclusion: Code2Video展示了作为可扩展、可解释和可控方法的潜力，为教育视频生成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: While recent generative models advance pixel-space video synthesis, they
remain limited in producing professional educational videos, which demand
disciplinary knowledge, precise visual structures, and coherent transitions,
limiting their applicability in educational scenarios. Intuitively, such
requirements are better addressed through the manipulation of a renderable
environment, which can be explicitly controlled via logical commands (e.g.,
code). In this work, we propose Code2Video, a code-centric agent framework for
generating educational videos via executable Python code. The framework
comprises three collaborative agents: (i) Planner, which structures lecture
content into temporally coherent flows and prepares corresponding visual
assets; (ii) Coder, which converts structured instructions into executable
Python codes while incorporating scope-guided auto-fix to enhance efficiency;
and (iii) Critic, which leverages vision-language models (VLM) with visual
anchor prompts to refine spatial layout and ensure clarity. To support
systematic evaluation, we build MMMC, a benchmark of professionally produced,
discipline-specific educational videos. We evaluate MMMC across diverse
dimensions, including VLM-as-a-Judge aesthetic scores, code efficiency, and
particularly, TeachQuiz, a novel end-to-end metric that quantifies how well a
VLM, after unlearning, can recover knowledge by watching the generated videos.
Our results demonstrate the potential of Code2Video as a scalable,
interpretable, and controllable approach, achieving 40% improvement over direct
code generation and producing videos comparable to human-crafted tutorials. The
code and datasets are available at https://github.com/showlab/Code2Video.

Result: 在OpenS2V基准测试中，该方法在主题一致性、自然度和文本相关性方面均优于现有开源和商业模型。

Conclusion: BindWeave框架能够有效处理复杂提示词语义，实现高质量的主题一致视频生成，在多个评估维度上表现优异。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer has shown remarkable abilities in generating
high-fidelity videos, delivering visually coherent frames and rich details over
extended durations. However, existing video generation models still fall short
in subject-consistent video generation due to an inherent difficulty in parsing
prompts that specify complex spatial relationships, temporal logic, and
interactions among multiple subjects. To address this issue, we propose
BindWeave, a unified framework that handles a broad range of subject-to-video
scenarios from single-subject cases to complex multi-subject scenes with
heterogeneous entities. To bind complex prompt semantics to concrete visual
subjects, we introduce an MLLM-DiT framework in which a pretrained multimodal
large language model performs deep cross-modal reasoning to ground entities and
disentangle roles, attributes, and interactions, yielding subject-aware hidden
states that condition the diffusion transformer for high-fidelity
subject-consistent video generation. Experiments on the OpenS2V benchmark
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across subject
consistency, naturalness, and text relevance in generated videos, outperforming
existing open-source and commercial models.

TL;DR: 提出SCNet网络优化自监督图像去噪，通过频率控制解决高频细节丢失和噪声学习问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督去噪方法存在高频结构细节保留不足和网络学习高频噪声的问题

Method: 提出频率带选择策略、基于Lipschitz常数的参数优化方法、以及频谱分离和低秩重建模块(SSR模块)

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验验证了SCNet的有效性

Conclusion: SCNet通过频率控制成功解决了自监督去噪中的高频细节保留和噪声学习问题

Abstract: Current self-supervised denoising methods for paired noisy images typically
involve mapping one noisy image through the network to the other noisy image.
However, after measuring the spectral bias of such methods using our proposed
Image Pair Frequency-Band Similarity, it suffers from two practical
limitations. Firstly, the high-frequency structural details in images are not
preserved well enough. Secondly, during the process of fitting high
frequencies, the network learns high-frequency noise from the mapped noisy
images. To address these challenges, we introduce a Spectral Controlling
network (SCNet) to optimize self-supervised denoising of paired noisy images.
First, we propose a selection strategy to choose frequency band components for
noisy images, to accelerate the convergence speed of training. Next, we present
a parameter optimization method that restricts the learning ability of
convolutional kernels to high-frequency noise using the Lipschitz constant,
without changing the network structure. Finally, we introduce the Spectral
Separation and low-rank Reconstruction module (SSR module), which separates
noise and high-frequency details through frequency domain separation and
low-rank space reconstruction, to retain the high-frequency structural details
of images. Experiments performed on synthetic and real-world datasets verify
the effectiveness of SCNet.

TL;DR: VLOD-TTA是一个用于视觉语言目标检测器的测试时自适应框架，通过利用密集提案重叠和图像条件提示分数来提升域偏移下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言目标检测器在零样本识别方面表现优异，但在域偏移情况下性能会下降，需要一种有效的测试时自适应方法来应对不同领域的分布变化。

Method: 提出IoU加权的熵目标函数，专注于空间一致的提案聚类；引入图像条件提示选择，根据图像级兼容性对提示进行排名，并将最有信息的提示与检测器对数融合。

Result: 在多种分布偏移场景（风格化域、驾驶场景、低光条件和常见损坏）下的基准测试显示，该方法在YOLO-World和Grounding DINO上相比零样本和TTA基线都有持续改进。

Conclusion: VLOD-TTA框架能有效提升视觉语言目标检测器在域偏移下的性能，通过提案重叠和图像条件提示选择实现了稳定的改进。

Abstract: Vision-language object detectors (VLODs) such as YOLO-World and Grounding
DINO achieve impressive zero-shot recognition by aligning region proposals with
text representations. However, their performance often degrades under domain
shift. We introduce VLOD-TTA, a test-time adaptation (TTA) framework for VLODs
that leverages dense proposal overlap and image-conditioned prompt scores.
First, an IoU-weighted entropy objective is proposed that concentrates
adaptation on spatially coherent proposal clusters and reduces confirmation
bias from isolated boxes. Second, image-conditioned prompt selection is
introduced, which ranks prompts by image-level compatibility and fuses the most
informative prompts with the detector logits. Our benchmarking across diverse
distribution shifts -- including stylized domains, driving scenes, low-light
conditions, and common corruptions -- shows the effectiveness of our method on
two state-of-the-art VLODs, YOLO-World and Grounding DINO, with consistent
improvements over the zero-shot and TTA baselines. Code :

Abstract: We introduce \textsc{MathSticks}, a benchmark for Visual Symbolic
Compositional Reasoning (VSCR), which unifies visual perception, symbolic
manipulation, and arithmetic consistency. Each task presents an incorrect
matchstick equation that must be corrected by moving one or two sticks under
strict conservation rules. The benchmark includes both text-guided and purely
visual settings, systematically covering digit scale, move complexity, solution
multiplicity, and operator variation, with 1.4M generated instances and a
curated test set. Evaluations of 14 vision--language models reveal substantial
limitations: closed-source models succeed only on simple cases, open-source
models fail in the visual regime, while humans exceed 90\% accuracy. These
findings establish \textsc{MathSticks} as a rigorous testbed for advancing
compositional reasoning across vision and symbols. Our code and dataset are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的通用异常检测方法NAGL，利用正常和异常样本作为参考，通过残差挖掘和异常特征学习实现跨域异常检测，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的通用异常检测方法仅使用正常样本作为参考，忽略了真实场景中可用的异常样本所包含的宝贵信息。

Method: 提出NAGL框架，包含残差挖掘(RM)和异常特征学习(AFL)两个关键组件。RM从正常-异常参考残差中提取异常模式，AFL通过残差映射自适应学习查询图像中的异常特征。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著优于现有的通用异常检测方法。

Conclusion: 这是首个在通用异常检测中采用正常和异常样本混合作为参考的工作，能更准确高效地进行跨域异常检测。

Abstract: Generalist Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to train a unified model on an
original domain that can detect anomalies in new target domains. Previous GAD
methods primarily use only normal samples as references, overlooking the
valuable information contained in anomalous samples that are often available in
real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a more practical
approach: normal-abnormal-guided generalist anomaly detection, which leverages
both normal and anomalous samples as references to guide anomaly detection
across diverse domains. We introduce the Normal-Abnormal Generalist Learning
(NAGL) framework, consisting of two key components: Residual Mining (RM) and
Anomaly Feature Learning (AFL). RM extracts abnormal patterns from
normal-abnormal reference residuals to establish transferable anomaly
representations, while AFL adaptively learns anomaly features in query images
through residual mapping to identify instance-aware anomalies. Our approach
effectively utilizes both normal and anomalous references for more accurate and
efficient cross-domain anomaly detection. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing GAD
approaches. This work represents the first to adopt a mixture of normal and
abnormal samples as references in generalist anomaly detection. The code and
datasets are available at https://github.com/JasonKyng/NAGL.

TL;DR: 提出了RAF（相对-绝对融合）特征提取技术，通过融合图像表示和数值特征来增强基于图像的迭代方法选择，解决了传统方法中不同矩阵可能产生相同图像表示的问题，在稀疏线性系统求解中实现了5.86%-11.50%的速度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于图像的迭代方法选择方法存在特征提取问题，可能将不同矩阵编码为相同的图像表示，导致选择结果相同且次优，需要改进特征提取技术来提高选择准确性。

Method: 提出RAF特征提取技术，同时提取和融合图像表示作为相对特征，以及对应的数值作为绝对特征，创建全面的矩阵表示，避免不同矩阵间的特征模糊性。

Result: 在SuiteSparse和自建的BMCMat数据集上的综合评估显示，RAF在稀疏线性系统求解中实现0.08s-0.29s的时间减少，比传统基于图像的选择方法快5.86%-11.50%，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: RAF通过相对-绝对特征融合有效解决了基于图像选择方法中的特征模糊问题，提高了迭代方法选择的准确性和效率，为稀疏线性系统求解提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Iterative method selection is crucial for solving sparse linear systems
because these methods inherently lack robustness. Though image-based selection
approaches have shown promise, their feature extraction techniques might encode
distinct matrices into identical image representations, leading to the same
selection and suboptimal method. In this paper, we introduce RAF
(Relative-Absolute Fusion), an efficient feature extraction technique to
enhance image-based selection approaches. By simultaneously extracting and
fusing image representations as relative features with corresponding numerical
values as absolute features, RAF achieves comprehensive matrix representations
that prevent feature ambiguity across distinct matrices, thus improving
selection accuracy and unlocking the potential of image-based selection
approaches. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of RAF on SuiteSparse and
our developed BMCMat (Balanced Multi-Classification Matrix dataset),
demonstrating solution time reductions of 0.08s-0.29s for sparse linear
systems, which is 5.86%-11.50% faster than conventional image-based selection
approaches and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. BMCMat is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于扩散模型的生成先验方法，通过利用视觉语言模型推断的affordance感知文本描述来指导手部姿态优化，解决严重遮挡情况下的3D手部姿态重建问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当手部大部分区域被自身或物体严重遮挡时，人类通常利用上下文知识（如affordance）来解决姿态模糊性。受此启发，研究如何利用affordance感知的文本描述来指导手部姿态优化。

Method: 使用扩散生成模型学习在affordance描述条件下的合理手部姿态分布，通过大型视觉语言模型推断手-物体交互的affordance描述，从而指导被遮挡区域的姿态优化。

Result: 在HOGraspNet数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在严重遮挡情况下显著优于最近的回归方法和缺乏上下文推理的基于扩散的优化方法。

Conclusion: affordance引导的优化能够显著提高手部姿态估计的准确性，特别是在严重遮挡情况下，证明了上下文推理对于手部姿态重建的重要性。

Abstract: How can we reconstruct 3D hand poses when large portions of the hand are
heavily occluded by itself or by objects? Humans often resolve such ambiguities
by leveraging contextual knowledge -- such as affordances, where an object's
shape and function suggest how the object is typically grasped. Inspired by
this observation, we propose a generative prior for hand pose refinement guided
by affordance-aware textual descriptions of hand-object interactions (HOI). Our
method employs a diffusion-based generative model that learns the distribution
of plausible hand poses conditioned on affordance descriptions, which are
inferred from a large vision-language model (VLM). This enables the refinement
of occluded regions into more accurate and functionally coherent hand poses.
Extensive experiments on HOGraspNet, a 3D hand-affordance dataset with severe
occlusions, demonstrate that our affordance-guided refinement significantly
improves hand pose estimation over both recent regression methods and
diffusion-based refinement lacking contextual reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉token在多模态大模型中消耗大量计算资源，现有压缩方法忽略了压缩引起的特征空间扰动带来的学习难度增加

Method: 通过分解token压缩引入的特征空间扰动，提出token一致性蒸馏和层一致性蒸馏，利用教师模型指导进行渐进学习

Result: 实验证明该框架具有优越的有效性、鲁棒性和泛化能力

Conclusion: EPIC框架通过渐进一致性蒸馏有效解决了视觉token压缩带来的训练困难问题

Abstract: Visual tokens consume substantial computational resources in multi-modal
large models (MLLMs), significantly compromising their efficiency. Recent works
have attempted to improve efficiency by compressing visual tokens during
training, either through modifications to model components or by introducing
additional parameters. However, they often overlook the increased learning
difficulty caused by such compression, as the model's parameter space struggles
to quickly adapt to the substantial perturbations in the feature space induced
by token compression. In this work, we propose to develop Efficient MLLMs via
Progressive Consistency Distillation (EPIC), a progressive learning framework.
Specifically, by decomposing the feature space perturbations introduced by
token compression along the token-wise and layer-wise dimensions, we introduce
token consistency distillation and layer consistency distillation,
respectively, aiming to reduce the training difficulty by leveraging guidance
from a teacher model and following a progressive learning trajectory. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness, robustness, and
generalization capabilities of our proposed framework.

TL;DR: CardioBench是一个标准化的超声心动图基础模型基准测试，整合了8个公开数据集，涵盖4个回归和5个分类任务，评估了心脏专用、生物医学和通用编码器的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声心动图基础模型缺乏标准化评估基准，现有解决方案多在私有数据上评估，限制了可比性。超声心动图面临噪声采集、高帧冗余和公开数据集有限等独特挑战。

Method: 将8个公开数据集统一为标准测试套件，在一致的零样本、探测和对齐协议下评估多种基础模型，包括心脏专用、生物医学和通用编码器。

Result: 结果显示不同模型家族具有互补优势：时序建模对功能回归至关重要，检索在分布偏移下提供鲁棒性，领域特定文本编码器捕获生理学有意义的轴。通用编码器迁移能力强但难以处理细粒度区分。

Conclusion: CardioBench通过发布预处理、分割和公开评估流程，建立了可复现的参考点，为未来超声心动图基础模型设计提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are reshaping medical imaging, yet their application
in echocardiography remains limited. While several echocardiography-specific
FMs have recently been introduced, no standardized benchmark exists to evaluate
them. Echocardiography poses unique challenges, including noisy acquisitions,
high frame redundancy, and limited public datasets. Most existing solutions
evaluate on private data, restricting comparability. To address this, we
introduce CardioBench, a comprehensive benchmark for echocardiography FMs.
CardioBench unifies eight publicly available datasets into a standardized suite
spanning four regression and five classification tasks, covering functional,
structural, diagnostic, and view recognition endpoints. We evaluate several
leading FM, including cardiac-specific, biomedical, and general-purpose
encoders, under consistent zero-shot, probing, and alignment protocols. Our
results highlight complementary strengths across model families: temporal
modeling is critical for functional regression, retrieval provides robustness
under distribution shift, and domain-specific text encoders capture
physiologically meaningful axes. General-purpose encoders transfer strongly and
often close the gap with probing, but struggle with fine-grained distinctions
like view classification and subtle pathology recognition. By releasing
preprocessing, splits, and public evaluation pipelines, CardioBench establishes
a reproducible reference point and offers actionable insights to guide the
design of future echocardiography foundation models.

Motivation: 现有确定性模型难以处理自遮挡和复杂手部关节带来的姿态模糊性，而现有概率方法仅限于单阶段估计且缺乏细化能力，无法产生准确的3D重建。

Method: 两阶段级联扩散框架：第一阶段使用联合扩散模型采样多样的3D关节假设，第二阶段使用网格潜在扩散模型在关节样本条件下重建3D手部网格。

Result: 在FreiHAND和HO3Dv2数据集上的实验表明，该方法实现了最先进的性能，同时有效建模了姿态分布。

Conclusion: 该方法成功结合了概率建模与级联细化的优势，提高了3D手部姿态重建的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deterministic models for 3D hand pose reconstruction, whether single-staged
or cascaded, struggle with pose ambiguities caused by self-occlusions and
complex hand articulations. Existing cascaded approaches refine predictions in
a coarse-to-fine manner but remain deterministic and cannot capture pose
uncertainties. Recent probabilistic methods model pose distributions yet are
restricted to single-stage estimation, which often fails to produce accurate 3D
reconstructions without refinement. To address these limitations, we propose a
coarse-to-fine cascaded diffusion framework that combines probabilistic
modeling with cascaded refinement. The first stage is a joint diffusion model
that samples diverse 3D joint hypotheses, and the second stage is a Mesh Latent
Diffusion Model (Mesh LDM) that reconstructs a 3D hand mesh conditioned on a
joint sample. By training Mesh LDM with diverse joint hypotheses in a learned
latent space, our framework learns distribution-aware joint-mesh relationships
and robust hand priors. Furthermore, the cascaded design mitigates the
difficulty of directly mapping 2D images to dense 3D poses, enhancing accuracy
through sequential refinement. Experiments on FreiHAND and HO3Dv2 demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while effectively
modeling pose distributions.

Abstract: Detecting agricultural pests in complex forestry environments using remote
sensing imagery is fundamental for ecological preservation, yet it is severely
hampered by practical challenges. Targets are often minuscule, heavily
occluded, and visually similar to the cluttered background, causing
conventional object detection models to falter due to the loss of fine-grained
features and an inability to handle extreme data imbalance. To overcome these
obstacles, this paper introduces Forestpest-YOLO, a detection framework
meticulously optimized for the nuances of forestry remote sensing. Building
upon the YOLOv8 architecture, our framework introduces a synergistic trio of
innovations. We first integrate a lossless downsampling module, SPD-Conv, to
ensure that critical high-resolution details of small targets are preserved
throughout the network. This is complemented by a novel cross-stage feature
fusion block, CSPOK, which dynamically enhances multi-scale feature
representation while suppressing background noise. Finally, we employ
VarifocalLoss to refine the training objective, compelling the model to focus
on high-quality and hard-to-classify samples. Extensive experiments on our
challenging, self-constructed ForestPest dataset demonstrate that
Forestpest-YOLO achieves state-of-the-art performance, showing marked
improvements in detecting small, occluded pests and significantly outperforming
established baseline models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微生物学图像分析需要大量手动标注数据，过程耗时耗力。本研究旨在证明使用视觉基础模型可以大幅减少数据标注需求，提高自动化系统的开发效率。

Method: 构建了5000张培养皿图像数据集，模拟传统数据收集和少样本场景。对比了三种视觉基础模型与传统基线模型在任务特定指标上的性能。

Result: MaskDINO在仅使用150张图像微调的情况下，性能接近经过大量训练的YoloV9模型；在仅25张图像时仍能保持竞争力，在约70%的样本上表现可靠。

Conclusion: 数据高效的基础模型能够以传统方法所需数据的一小部分达到相似性能，为自动化微生物系统提供了更快的开发周期和更高的性能上限。

Abstract: The process of quantifying mold colonies on Petri dish samples is of critical
importance for the assessment of indoor air quality, as high colony counts can
indicate potential health risks and deficiencies in ventilation systems.
Conventionally the automation of such a labor-intensive process, as well as
other tasks in microbiology, relies on the manual annotation of large datasets
and the subsequent extensive training of models like YoloV9. To demonstrate
that exhaustive annotation is not a prerequisite anymore when tackling a new
vision task, we compile a representative dataset of 5000 Petri dish images
annotated with bounding boxes, simulating both a traditional data collection
approach as well as few-shot and low-shot scenarios with well curated subsets
with instance level masks. We benchmark three vision foundation models against
traditional baselines on task specific metrics, reflecting realistic real-world
requirements. Notably, MaskDINO attains near-parity with an extensively trained
YoloV9 model while finetuned only on 150 images, retaining competitive
performance with as few as 25 images, still being reliable on $\approx$ 70% of
the samples. Our results show that data-efficient foundation models can match
traditional approaches with only a fraction of the required data, enabling
earlier development and faster iterative improvement of automated
microbiological systems with a superior upper-bound performance than
traditional models would achieve.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE-MTL方法依赖单任务预训练骨干网络，在从单任务学习到多任务学习的过渡中存在冗余适应和低效知识共享问题。

Method: 在基于LoRA的MoE中引入自适应共享专家，共享专家与稀疏专家通过路由器计算的门控权重联合归一化；增加LoRA专家数量同时按比例降低其秩，实现更细粒度的专家设计。

Result: 在PASCAL-Context基准测试的统一训练设置下，ASE在不同配置中持续提升性能，验证了细粒度设计对MTL的有效性。

Conclusion: ASE框架通过自适应共享专家和细粒度专家设计，有效解决了MoE-MTL中的知识共享和专家协作问题，提升了多任务学习性能。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a powerful framework for multi-task
learning (MTL). However, existing MoE-MTL methods often rely on single-task
pretrained backbones and suffer from redundant adaptation and inefficient
knowledge sharing during the transition from single-task to multi-task learning
(STL to MTL). To address these limitations, we propose adaptive shared experts
(ASE) within a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) based MoE, where shared experts are
assigned router-computed gating weights jointly normalized with sparse experts.
This design facilitates STL to MTL transition, enhances expert specialization,
and cooperation. Furthermore, we incorporate fine-grained experts by increasing
the number of LoRA experts while proportionally reducing their rank, enabling
more effective knowledge sharing under a comparable parameter budget. Extensive
experiments on the PASCAL-Context benchmark, under unified training settings,
demonstrate that ASE consistently improves performance across diverse
configurations and validates the effectiveness of fine-grained designs for MTL.

Motivation: 现有的生成式视频帧插值方法只能合成固定数量的中间帧，缺乏调整生成帧率或总序列时长的灵活性。

Method: 提出时间戳感知旋转位置编码(TaRoPE)支持任意时间戳插值，采用分段帧合成策略实现任意长度插值，并设计了外观-运动解耦条件策略确保时空连续性。

Result: 在2x到32x的多尺度帧插值基准测试中，ArbInterp在所有场景下都优于先前方法，具有更高的保真度和更无缝的时空连续性。

Conclusion: ArbInterp框架成功解决了生成式视频帧插值在灵活性和可扩展性方面的限制，为视频生成应用提供了更强大的工具。

Abstract: Video frame interpolation (VFI), which generates intermediate frames from
given start and end frames, has become a fundamental function in video
generation applications. However, existing generative VFI methods are
constrained to synthesize a fixed number of intermediate frames, lacking the
flexibility to adjust generated frame rates or total sequence duration. In this
work, we present ArbInterp, a novel generative VFI framework that enables
efficient interpolation at any timestamp and of any length. Specifically, to
support interpolation at any timestamp, we propose the Timestamp-aware Rotary
Position Embedding (TaRoPE), which modulates positions in temporal RoPE to
align generated frames with target normalized timestamps. This design enables
fine-grained control over frame timestamps, addressing the inflexibility of
fixed-position paradigms in prior work. For any-length interpolation, we
decompose long-sequence generation into segment-wise frame synthesis. We
further design a novel appearance-motion decoupled conditioning strategy: it
leverages prior segment endpoints to enforce appearance consistency and
temporal semantics to maintain motion coherence, ensuring seamless
spatiotemporal transitions across segments. Experimentally, we build
comprehensive benchmarks for multi-scale frame interpolation (2x to 32x) to
assess generalizability across arbitrary interpolation factors. Results show
that ArbInterp outperforms prior methods across all scenarios with higher
fidelity and more seamless spatiotemporal continuity. Project website:

Abstract: Color representation is essential in computer vision and human-computer
interaction. There are multiple color models available. The choice of a
suitable color model is critical for various applications. This paper presents
a review of color models and spaces, analyzing their theoretical foundations,
computational properties, and practical applications. We explore traditional
models such as RGB, CMYK, and YUV, perceptually uniform spaces like CIELAB and
CIELUV, and fuzzy-based approaches as well. Additionally, we conduct a series
of experiments to evaluate color models from various perspectives, like device
dependency, chromatic consistency, and computational complexity. Our
experimental results reveal gaps in existing color models and show that the HS*
family is the most aligned with human perception. The review also identifies
key strengths and limitations of different models and outlines open challenges

*Abdelrhman Werby,Dennis Rotondi,Fabio Scaparro,Kai O. Arras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KeySG是一个分层3D场景图框架，通过关键帧选择和多模态信息增强，结合分层RAG管道解决大型场景图的可扩展性问题，在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D场景图方法存在语义关系预定义限制，且大型环境中的序列化容易超出LLM上下文窗口，需要更通用、可扩展的场景表示方法。

Method: 构建分层图结构（楼层、房间、物体、功能元素），通过优化几何和视觉覆盖的关键帧选择，利用VLM提取场景信息，避免显式建模物体关系，采用分层RAG管道进行上下文检索。

Result: 在四个基准测试（包括3D物体分割和复杂查询检索）中，KeySG在大多数指标上优于现有方法，展示了更好的语义丰富性和效率。

Conclusion: KeySG通过分层表示和关键帧优化，实现了更通用、任务无关的推理和规划，有效解决了大型3D场景图的可扩展性问题。

Abstract: In recent years, 3D scene graphs have emerged as a powerful world
representation, offering both geometric accuracy and semantic richness.
Combining 3D scene graphs with large language models enables robots to reason,
plan, and navigate in complex human-centered environments. However, current
approaches for constructing 3D scene graphs are semantically limited to a
predefined set of relationships, and their serialization in large environments
can easily exceed an LLM's context window. We introduce KeySG, a framework that
represents 3D scenes as a hierarchical graph consisting of floors, rooms,
objects, and functional elements, where nodes are augmented with multi-modal
information extracted from keyframes selected to optimize geometric and visual
coverage. The keyframes allow us to efficiently leverage VLM to extract scene
information, alleviating the need to explicitly model relationship edges
between objects, enabling more general, task-agnostic reasoning and planning.
Our approach can process complex and ambiguous queries while mitigating the
scalability issues associated with large scene graphs by utilizing a
hierarchical retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to extract relevant
context from the graph. Evaluated across four distinct benchmarks -- including
3D object segmentation and complex query retrieval -- KeySG outperforms prior
approaches on most metrics, demonstrating its superior semantic richness and
efficiency.

*Zesheng Li,Shuaibo Li,Wei Ma,Jianwei Guo,Hongbin Zha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MDS-NeRF是一种针对神经辐射场（NeRF）的多层次动态风格迁移方法，通过重新设计NeRF流程并引入动态风格注入模块，在保持场景多尺度空间结构的同时有效传递艺术风格特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的NeRF风格迁移方法通常将风格统计信息简单集成到原始NeRF流程中，导致内容保持和艺术风格化效果都不理想。需要专门为风格化重新设计NeRF流程。

Method: 提出了多层次特征适配器生成多级特征网格表示，动态风格注入模块学习提取相关风格特征并自适应集成到内容模式中，最后通过多层次级联解码器将风格化特征转换为最终风格化视图。

Result: 大量实验证明MDS-NeRF在3D风格迁移方面表现优异，能够保持多尺度空间结构的同时有效传递风格特征。

Conclusion: MDS-NeRF通过重新设计的NeRF流程和创新的动态风格注入机制，为3D风格迁移提供了更优的解决方案，支持使用3D风格参考进行全视角风格迁移。

Abstract: As the application of neural radiance fields (NeRFs) in various 3D vision
tasks continues to expand, numerous NeRF-based style transfer techniques have
been developed. However, existing methods typically integrate style statistics
into the original NeRF pipeline, often leading to suboptimal results in both
content preservation and artistic stylization. In this paper, we present
multi-level dynamic style transfer for NeRFs (MDS-NeRF), a novel approach that
reengineers the NeRF pipeline specifically for stylization and incorporates an
innovative dynamic style injection module. Particularly, we propose a
multi-level feature adaptor that helps generate a multi-level feature grid
representation from the content radiance field, effectively capturing the
multi-scale spatial structure of the scene. In addition, we present a dynamic
style injection module that learns to extract relevant style features and
adaptively integrates them into the content patterns. The stylized multi-level
features are then transformed into the final stylized view through our proposed
multi-level cascade decoder. Furthermore, we extend our 3D style transfer
method to support omni-view style transfer using 3D style references. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MDS-NeRF achieves outstanding performance for 3D
style transfer, preserving multi-scale spatial structures while effectively
transferring stylistic characteristics.

Motivation: 解决结构缺陷标注中人工成本高、效率低的问题，为基础设施安全提供自动化标注解决方案。

Method: 集成大型视觉语言模型与语义模式匹配模块，采用优化的领域特定提示和递归验证过程，通过迭代自问机制进行精炼。

Result: 在缺陷与非缺陷图像区分上达到98%准确率，在四类缺陷标注中达到85%-98%准确率（类平衡），在类不平衡数据集上达到80%-92%准确率。

Conclusion: ADPT框架为高保真数据集构建提供了可扩展且成本效益高的解决方案，支持结构损伤评估中的迁移学习和领域适应等下游任务。

Abstract: Automated structural defect annotation is essential for ensuring
infrastructure safety while minimizing the high costs and inefficiencies of
manual labeling. A novel agentic annotation framework, Agent-based Defect
Pattern Tagger (ADPT), is introduced that integrates Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs) with a semantic pattern matching module and an iterative
self-questioning refinement mechanism. By leveraging optimized domain-specific
prompting and a recursive verification process, ADPT transforms raw visual data
into high-quality, semantically labeled defect datasets without any manual
supervision. Experimental results demonstrate that ADPT achieves up to 98%
accuracy in distinguishing defective from non-defective images, and 85%-98%
annotation accuracy across four defect categories under class-balanced
settings, with 80%-92% accuracy on class-imbalanced datasets. The framework
offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for high-fidelity dataset
construction, providing strong support for downstream tasks such as transfer
learning and domain adaptation in structural damage assessment.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于博弈论的融合方法Shapley-credited Context-Aware Dawid-Skene with Agreement，用于多标签理解车载摄像头视频，通过上下文感知的模型可靠性学习和Shapley值信用分配，提升视觉语言模型在自动驾驶系统中的可靠性和校准性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在自动驾驶系统中应用日益广泛，但幻觉问题限制了其在安全关键管道中的可靠性，需要开发能够校准模型输出、适应漂移并保持解释性的融合方法。

Method: 使用博弈论融合方法，学习每个模型在特定上下文和标签下的可靠性，将模型报告转换为带协议保护的似然比，结合上下文先验和通过Shapley值更新的公共声誉状态，生成可阈值化的后验概率。

Result: 与最佳单模型相比，Hamming距离减少23%，Macro-F1提升55%，Micro-F1提升47%，支持VLM融合作为自动驾驶管道中校准、可解释且鲁棒的决策支持组件。

Conclusion: 该方法能够放大可靠模型间的共识，保留独特正确的单模型信号，适应数据漂移，为自动驾驶系统提供可靠的视觉语言模型融合解决方案。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly used in
autonomous-vehicle (AV) stacks, but hallucination limits their reliability in
safety-critical pipelines. We present Shapley-credited Context-Aware
Dawid-Skene with Agreement, a game-theoretic fusion method for multi-label
understanding of ego-view dashcam video. It learns per-model, per-label,
context-conditioned reliabilities from labelled history and, at inference,
converts each model's report into an agreement-guardrailed log-likelihood ratio
that is combined with a contextual prior and a public reputation state updated
via Shapley-based team credit. The result is calibrated, thresholdable
posteriors that (i) amplify agreement among reliable models, (ii) preserve
uniquely correct single-model signals, and (iii) adapt to drift. To specialise
general VLMs, we curate 1,000 real-world dashcam clips with structured
annotations (scene description, manoeuvre recommendation, rationale) via an
automatic pipeline that fuses HDD ground truth, vehicle kinematics, and YOLOv11
+ BoT-SORT tracking, guided by a three-step chain-of-thought prompt; three
heterogeneous VLMs are then fine-tuned with LoRA. We evaluate with Hamming
distance, Micro-Macro-F1, and average per-video latency. Empirically, the
proposed method achieves a 23% reduction in Hamming distance, 55% improvement
in Macro-F1, and 47% improvement in Micro-F1 when comparing with the best
single model, supporting VLM fusion as a calibrated, interpretable, and robust
decision-support component for AV pipelines.

TL;DR: 提出COFA策略，通过前景-背景特征增强提升视觉语言导航的泛化能力，在REVERIE和R2R数据集上达到SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言导航中前景和背景区域的重要性未被充分探索，前景提供语义线索，背景包含空间连接信息

Method: 使用语义增强地标识别分离前景和背景特征，通过共识驱动的在线增强策略整合两阶段投票结果

Result: 在REVERIE和R2R数据集上提升了基线模型的泛化能力并达到最先进性能

Conclusion: 前景-背景特征在线增强策略有效提升了视觉语言导航的泛化性能

Abstract: Following language instructions, vision-language navigation (VLN) agents are
tasked with navigating unseen environments. While augmenting multifaceted
visual representations has propelled advancements in VLN, the significance of
foreground and background in visual observations remains underexplored.
Intuitively, foreground regions provide semantic cues, whereas the background
encompasses spatial connectivity information. Inspired on this insight, we
propose a Consensus-driven Online Feature Augmentation strategy (COFA) with
alternative foreground and background features to facilitate the navigable
generalization. Specifically, we first leverage semantically-enhanced landmark
identification to disentangle foreground and background as candidate augmented
features. Subsequently, a consensus-driven online augmentation strategy
encourages the agent to consolidate two-stage voting results on feature
preferences according to diverse instructions and navigational locations.
Experiments on REVERIE and R2R demonstrate that our online
foreground-background augmentation boosts the generalization of baseline and
attains state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RCOR提出了一种鲁棒的上下文感知目标识别方法，通过将定位作为识别的组成部分来解耦目标中心和上下文建模，实现无需牺牲上下文信息的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准监督学习容易导致模型过度依赖背景信息（捷径学习），限制了模型在真实场景中的鲁棒性。现有方法主要通过抑制背景来改进泛化，但牺牲了上下文信息。

Method: RCOR将定位作为识别的组成部分，解耦目标中心和上下文建模，然后进行鲁棒的非参数融合。

Result: RCOR在包含域内和域外背景的数据集上提高了监督模型和VLM的性能，即使在复杂场景如ImageNet-1k中也能实现定位先于识别。

Conclusion: 该方法首次同时实现了鲁棒性和上下文感知，无需在两者之间做出妥协。

Abstract: In visual recognition, both the object of interest (referred to as
foreground, FG, for simplicity) and its surrounding context (background, BG)
play an important role. However, standard supervised learning often leads to
unintended over-reliance on the BG, known as shortcut learning of spurious
correlations, limiting model robustness in real-world deployment settings. In
the literature, the problem is mainly addressed by suppressing the BG,
sacrificing context information for improved generalization.
  We propose RCOR -- Robust Context-Aware Object Recognition -- the first
approach that jointly achieves robustness and context-awareness without
compromising either. RCOR treats localization as an integral part of
recognition to decouple object-centric and context-aware modelling, followed by
a robust, non-parametric fusion. It improves the performance of both supervised
models and VLM on datasets with both in-domain and out-of-domain BG, even
without fine-tuning. The results confirm that localization before recognition
is now possible even in complex scenes as in ImageNet-1k.

TL;DR: 提出使用无条件判别器(UCD)来改进GAN训练，通过移除条件输入避免冗余捷径，促进纳什均衡，在ImageNet-64上达到1.47 FID的优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗训练对一步生成至关重要，但GAN训练在实践中难以收敛且存在模式崩溃问题。研究发现条件判别器中的条件输入会导致冗余捷径，阻碍有意义的特征提取。

Method: 采用无条件判别器(UCD)，强制判别器在不注入条件信息的情况下提取更全面和鲁棒的特征，从而为生成器提供更好的监督。

Result: 在ImageNet-64数据集上达到1.47 FID，超越了StyleGAN-XL和多个最先进的一步扩散模型，性能显著提升且效率高。

Conclusion: 无条件判别器能有效促进GAN训练中的纳什均衡，与经典GAN理论兼容，可作为即插即用模块实现显著性能改进。

Abstract: Adversarial training turns out to be the key to one-step generation,
especially for Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and diffusion model
distillation. Yet in practice, GAN training hardly converges properly and
struggles in mode collapse. In this work, we quantitatively analyze the extent
of Nash equilibrium in GAN training, and conclude that redundant shortcuts by
inputting condition in $D$ disables meaningful knowledge extraction. We thereby
propose to employ an unconditional discriminator (UCD), in which $D$ is
enforced to extract more comprehensive and robust features with no condition
injection. In this way, $D$ is able to leverage better knowledge to supervise
$G$, which promotes Nash equilibrium in GAN literature. Theoretical guarantee
on compatibility with vanilla GAN theory indicates that UCD can be implemented
in a plug-in manner. Extensive experiments confirm the significant performance
improvements with high efficiency. For instance, we achieved \textbf{1.47 FID}
on the ImageNet-64 dataset, surpassing StyleGAN-XL and several state-of-the-art
one-step diffusion models. The code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Fashion image generation has so far focused on narrow tasks such as virtual
try-on, where garments appear in clean studio environments. In contrast,
editorial fashion presents garments through dynamic poses, diverse locations,
and carefully crafted visual narratives. We introduce the task of virtual
fashion photo-shoot, which seeks to capture this richness by transforming
standardized garment images into contextually grounded editorial imagery. To
enable this new direction, we construct the first large-scale dataset of
garment-lookbook pairs, bridging the gap between e-commerce and fashion media.
Because such pairs are not readily available, we design an automated retrieval
pipeline that aligns garments across domains, combining visual-language
reasoning with object-level localization. We construct a dataset with three
garment-lookbook pair accuracy levels: high quality (10,000 pairs), medium
quality (50,000 pairs), and low quality (300,000 pairs). This dataset offers a
foundation for models that move beyond catalog-style generation and toward
fashion imagery that reflects creativity, atmosphere, and storytelling.

Motivation: 现有基于CNN和Transformer的深度伪造检测方法在建模复杂非线性伪造痕迹方面仍有改进空间，需要更有效的检测算法。

Result: 在多个公共数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法实现了优越的性能。

Conclusion: 结合几何先验和网络学习过程的KAN-based方法在深度伪造检测中表现出色。

Abstract: The rapid development of deepfake generation techniques necessitates robust
face forgery detection algorithms. While methods based on Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformers are effective, there is still room for
improvement in modeling the highly complex and non-linear nature of forgery
artifacts. To address this issue, we propose a novel detection method based on
the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). By replacing fixed activation functions
with learnable splines, our KAN-based approach is better suited to this
challenge. Furthermore, to guide the network's focus towards critical facial
areas, we introduce a Landmark-assisted Adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold Network
(LAKAN) module. This module uses facial landmarks as a structural prior to
dynamically generate the internal parameters of the KAN, creating an
instance-specific signal that steers a general-purpose image encoder towards
the most informative facial regions with artifacts. This core innovation
creates a powerful combination between geometric priors and the network's
learning process. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that
our proposed method achieves superior performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have enabled
impressive generative capabilities, but they also raise significant safety
concerns due to the potential to produce harmful or undesirable content. While
concept erasure has been explored as a mitigation strategy, most existing
approaches and corresponding attack evaluations are tailored to Stable
Diffusion (SD) and exhibit limited effectiveness when transferred to
next-generation rectified flow transformers such as Flux. In this work, we
present ReFlux, the first concept attack method specifically designed to assess
the robustness of concept erasure in the latest rectified flow-based T2I
framework. Our approach is motivated by the observation that existing concept
erasure techniques, when applied to Flux, fundamentally rely on a phenomenon
known as attention localization. Building on this insight, we propose a simple
yet effective attack strategy that specifically targets this property. At its
core, a reverse-attention optimization strategy is introduced to effectively
reactivate suppressed signals while stabilizing attention. This is further
reinforced by a velocity-guided dynamic that enhances the robustness of concept
reactivation by steering the flow matching process, and a
consistency-preserving objective that maintains the global layout and preserves
unrelated content. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed attack method, establishing a
reliable benchmark for evaluating the robustness of concept erasure strategies
in rectified flow transformers.

Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion in autonomous vehicles is becoming more common to offer a
more robust alternative for several perception tasks. This need arises from the
unique contribution of each sensor in collecting data: camera-radar fusion
offers a cost-effective solution by combining rich semantic information from
cameras with accurate distance measurements from radar, without incurring
excessive financial costs or overwhelming data processing requirements. Map
segmentation is a critical task for enabling effective vehicle behaviour in its
environment, yet it continues to face significant challenges in achieving high
accuracy and meeting real-time performance requirements. Therefore, this work
presents a novel and efficient map segmentation architecture, using cameras and
radars, in the \acrfull{bev} space. Our model introduces a real-time map
segmentation architecture considering aspects such as high accuracy, per-class
balancing, and inference time. To accomplish this, we use an advanced loss set
together with a new lightweight head to improve the perception results. Our
results show that, with these modifications, our approach achieves results
comparable to large models, reaching 53.5 mIoU, while also setting a new
benchmark for inference time, improving it by 260\% over the strongest baseline

Abstract: Clouds significantly affect the quality of optical satellite images, which
seriously limits their precise application. Recently, deep learning has been
widely applied to cloud detection and has achieved satisfactory results.
However, the lack of distinctive features in thin clouds and the low quality of
training samples limit the cloud detection accuracy of deep learning methods,
leaving space for further improvements. In this paper, we propose a weakly
supervised cloud detection method that combines spectral features and
multi-scale scene-level deep network (SpecMCD) to obtain highly accurate
pixel-level cloud masks. The method first utilizes a progressive training
framework with a multi-scale scene-level dataset to train the multi-scale
scene-level cloud detection network. Pixel-level cloud probability maps are
then obtained by combining the multi-scale probability maps and cloud thickness
map based on the characteristics of clouds in dense cloud coverage and large
cloud-area coverage images. Finally, adaptive thresholds are generated based on
the differentiated regions of the scene-level cloud masks at different scales
and combined with distance-weighted optimization to obtain binary cloud masks.
Two datasets, WDCD and GF1MS-WHU, comprising a total of 60 Gaofen-1
multispectral (GF1-MS) images, were used to verify the effectiveness of the
proposed method. Compared to the other weakly supervised cloud detection
methods such as WDCD and WSFNet, the F1-score of the proposed SpecMCD method
shows an improvement of over 7.82%, highlighting the superiority and potential
of the SpecMCD method for cloud detection under different cloud coverage
conditions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Align Your Tangent (AYT)的新方法，通过引入流形特征距离(MFD)损失函数来解决一致性模型训练中的振荡切线问题，显著加速训练并提升样本质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 一致性模型虽然能实现一步或两步采样，但需要长时间训练和大批量才能获得有竞争力的样本质量。研究发现CM在收敛附近的训练动态中，切线方向是振荡的，平行于数据流形而不是朝向流形。

Method: 提出了流形特征距离(MFD)损失函数，该损失能提供流形对齐的切线方向，使更新方向朝向数据流形。这种方法称为Align Your Tangent (AYT)。

Result: AYT方法能显著加速一致性模型的训练，训练速度提升数个数量级，甚至在LPIPS指标上表现更好。此外，该方法支持使用极小的批量大小进行训练而不影响样本质量。

Conclusion: 通过解决一致性模型训练中的振荡切线问题，AYT方法实现了训练效率的显著提升，同时保持了高质量的样本生成能力。

Abstract: With diffusion and flow matching models achieving state-of-the-art generating
performance, the interest of the community now turned to reducing the inference
time without sacrificing sample quality. Consistency Models (CMs), which are
trained to be consistent on diffusion or probability flow ordinary differential
equation (PF-ODE) trajectories, enable one or two-step flow or diffusion
sampling. However, CMs typically require prolonged training with large batch
sizes to obtain competitive sample quality. In this paper, we examine the
training dynamics of CMs near convergence and discover that CM tangents -- CM
output update directions -- are quite oscillatory, in the sense that they move
parallel to the data manifold, not towards the manifold. To mitigate
oscillatory tangents, we propose a new loss function, called the manifold
feature distance (MFD), which provides manifold-aligned tangents that point
toward the data manifold. Consequently, our method -- dubbed Align Your Tangent
(AYT) -- can accelerate CM training by orders of magnitude and even out-perform
the learned perceptual image patch similarity metric (LPIPS). Furthermore, we
find that our loss enables training with extremely small batch sizes without
compromising sample quality. Code: https://github.com/1202kbs/AYT

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无监督展开鲁棒主成分分析(U2-rPCA)方法，用于超声微血管成像中的高灵敏度杂波滤波，该方法保持数学可解释性且无需学习标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SVD和rPCA杂波滤波策略在特征建模和组织-血流分离方面存在局限，而基于深度学习的监督滤波器面临可解释性和缺乏体内外真实标签的挑战。

Method: 从迭代重加权最小二乘rPCA基线展开，具有内在低秩和稀疏正则化，添加稀疏增强单元以增强捕获稀疏微流信号的能力，类似于自适应滤波器。

Result: 在仿真和公开体内数据集上的实验验证表明，U2-rPCA优于SVD方法、rPCA基线和另一种基于深度学习的滤波器，将功率多普勒图像的对比度噪声比提高了2-10 dB。

Conclusion: U2-rPCA方法在保持数学可解释性的同时，有效解决了杂波滤波问题，无需监督训练标签，并通过消融研究验证了其构建模块的有效性。

Abstract: High-sensitivity clutter filtering is a fundamental step in ultrasound
microvascular imaging. Singular value decomposition (SVD) and robust principal
component analysis (rPCA) are the main clutter filtering strategies. However,
both strategies are limited in feature modeling and tissue-blood flow
separation for high-quality microvascular imaging. Recently, deep
learning-based clutter filtering has shown potential in more thoroughly
separating tissue and blood flow signals. However, the existing supervised
filters face the challenges of interpretability and lack of in-vitro and
in-vivo ground truths. While the interpretability issue can be addressed by
algorithm deep unfolding, the training ground truth remains unsolved. To this
end, this paper proposes an unsupervised unfolded rPCA (U2-rPCA) method that
preserves mathematical interpretability and is insusceptible to learning
labels. Specifically, U2-rPCA is unfolded from an iteratively reweighted least
squares (IRLS) rPCA baseline with intrinsic low-rank and sparse regularization.
A sparse-enhancement unit is added to the network to strengthen its capability
to capture the sparse micro-flow signals. U2-rPCA is like an adaptive filter
that is trained with part of the image sequence and then used for the following
frames. Experimental validations on a in-silico dataset and public in-vivo
datasets demonstrated the outperformance of U2-rPCA when compared with the
SVD-based method, the rPCA baseline, and another deep learning-based filter.
Particularly, the proposed method improved the contrastto-noise ratio (CNR) of
the power Doppler image by 2 dB to 10 dB when compared with other methods.
Furthermore, the effectiveness of the building modules of U2-rPCA was validated
through ablation studies.

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于脑部血管多模态分割的框架，通过图像到图像转换技术实现跨域分割，避免特定领域模型设计和数据协调，在保持空间信息的同时操纵血管外观。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑部血管的复杂形态给自动分割模型带来挑战，且现有方法通常只关注单一成像模态。准确治疗脑部疾病需要全面理解脑血管树，不受特定采集程序限制。

Method: 采用解缠技术独立操纵不同图像属性，在域间转换时保持标签信息。重点在适应过程中操纵血管外观，同时保留形状和位置等关键空间信息。

Abstract: The intricate morphology of brain vessels poses significant challenges for
automatic segmentation models, which usually focus on a single imaging
modality. However, accurately treating brain-related conditions requires a
comprehensive understanding of the cerebrovascular tree, regardless of the
specific acquisition procedure. Our framework effectively segments brain
arteries and veins in various datasets through image-to-image translation while
avoiding domain-specific model design and data harmonization between the source
and the target domain. This is accomplished by employing disentanglement
techniques to independently manipulate different image properties, allowing
them to move from one domain to another in a label-preserving manner.
Specifically, we focus on manipulating vessel appearances during adaptation
while preserving spatial information, such as shapes and locations, which are
crucial for correct segmentation. Our evaluation effectively bridges large and
varied domain gaps across medical centers, image modalities, and vessel types.
Additionally, we conduct ablation studies on the optimal number of required
annotations and other architectural choices. The results highlight our
framework's robustness and versatility, demonstrating the potential of domain
adaptation methodologies to perform cerebrovascular image segmentation in
multiple scenarios accurately. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有生成AI方法往往忽视图像的几何结构，仅关注概率方法，或在潜在空间中预设均匀分布。本研究旨在统一几何和概率视角，揭示扩散模型的本质。

Method: 提出了几何框架和基于核的概率方法，将扩散模型解释为向图像流形的投影机制，构建了确定性模型MPPM，在表示空间和潜在空间中操作。

Result: 潜在MPPM（LMPPM）在各种数据集上优于潜在扩散模型（LDM），在图像恢复和生成方面取得了更优越的结果。

Conclusion: 该研究成功地将几何和概率视角统一，为理解扩散模型提供了新的解释框架，并开发出性能更优的生成模型。

Abstract: The foundational premise of generative AI for images is the assumption that
images are inherently low-dimensional objects embedded within a
high-dimensional space. Additionally, it is often implicitly assumed that
thematic image datasets form smooth or piecewise smooth manifolds. Common
approaches overlook the geometric structure and focus solely on probabilistic
methods, approximating the probability distribution through universal
approximation techniques such as the kernel method. In some generative models,
the low dimensional nature of the data manifest itself by the introduction of a
lower dimensional latent space. Yet, the probability distribution in the latent
or the manifold coordinate space is considered uninteresting and is predefined
or considered uniform. This study unifies the geometric and probabilistic
perspectives by providing a geometric framework and a kernel-based
probabilistic method simultaneously. The resulting framework demystifies
diffusion models by interpreting them as a projection mechanism onto the
manifold of ``good images''. This interpretation leads to the construction of a
new deterministic model, the Manifold-Probabilistic Projection Model (MPPM),
which operates in both the representation (pixel) space and the latent space.
We demonstrate that the Latent MPPM (LMPPM) outperforms the Latent Diffusion
Model (LDM) across various datasets, achieving superior results in terms of
image restoration and generation.

TL;DR: 提出了二进制编码方法替代one-hot编码来减少医学图像分割的计算和内存需求，但在108类脑部分割任务中未能达到最先进的分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学图像分割中多类别（108类）带来的计算复杂度和内存需求线性增长问题，传统one-hot编码方法效率低下。

Method: 使用二进制编码家族方法，包括普通二进制编码、纠错输出码(ECOC)、类别加权、硬/软解码、类别到码字分配和标签嵌入树，替代one-hot编码。

Result: 相比one-hot编码（DSC=82.4），二进制分割方法性能下降，DSC范围在39.3到73.8之间，未能达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 虽然二进制编码在计算效率上有优势，但在医学图像分割质量上存在挑战，希望这项工作能启发未来对大型多类分割任务的紧凑编码策略研究。

Abstract: This work presents novel methods to reduce computational and memory
requirements for medical image segmentation with a large number of classes. We
curiously observe challenges in maintaining state-of-the-art segmentation
performance with all of the explored options. Standard learning-based methods
typically employ one-hot encoding of class labels. The computational complexity
and memory requirements thus increase linearly with the number of classes. We
propose a family of binary encoding approaches instead of one-hot encoding to
reduce the computational complexity and memory requirements to logarithmic in
the number of classes. In addition to vanilla binary encoding, we investigate
the effects of error-correcting output codes (ECOCs), class weighting,
hard/soft decoding, class-to-codeword assignment, and label embedding trees. We
apply the methods to the use case of whole brain parcellation with 108 classes
based on 3D MRI images. While binary encodings have proven efficient in
so-called extreme classification problems in computer vision, we faced
challenges in reaching state-of-the-art segmentation quality with binary
encodings. Compared to one-hot encoding (Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) =
82.4 (2.8)), we report reduced segmentation performance with the binary
segmentation approaches, achieving DSCs in the range from 39.3 to 73.8.
Informative negative results all too often go unpublished. We hope that this
work inspires future research of compact encoding strategies for large
multi-class segmentation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机在目标检测中具有高速响应、低延迟等优势，但缺乏纹理和颜色信息，难以实现开放词汇检测。现有方法局限于预定义类别，无法泛化到新物体。

Method: 使用图像帧作为教师模型输入，通过空间注意力蒸馏指导学生事件模型学习CLIP的视觉表示；设计SNN-CNN混合框架，SNN自适应确定事件分割时机，CNN处理特征进行目标检测。

Result: 该方法能够从原始事件输入中学习有意义的视觉特征，继承CLIP的广泛视觉知识，避免固定分组事件分割造成的信息丢失。

Conclusion: 提出的框架成功弥合了事件流与图像之间的模态差距，实现了事件数据上的开放词汇目标检测，解决了事件相机在检测新物体时的泛化问题。

Abstract: Event cameras offer advantages in object detection tasks due to high-speed
response, low latency, and robustness to motion blur. However, event cameras
lack texture and color information, making open-vocabulary detection
particularly challenging. Current event-based detection methods are typically
trained on predefined categories, limiting their ability to generalize to novel
objects, where encountering previously unseen objects is common.
Vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled open-vocabulary object detection in
RGB images. However, the modality gap between images and event streams makes it
ineffective to directly transfer CLIP to event data, as CLIP was not designed
for event streams. To bridge this gap, we propose an event-image knowledge
distillation framework that leverages CLIP's semantic understanding to achieve
open-vocabulary object detection on event data. Instead of training CLIP
directly on event streams, we use image frames as inputs to a teacher model,
guiding the event-based student model to learn CLIP's rich visual
representations. Through spatial attention-based distillation, the student
network learns meaningful visual features directly from raw event inputs while
inheriting CLIP's broad visual knowledge. Furthermore, to prevent information
loss due to event data segmentation, we design a hybrid spiking neural network
(SNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) framework. Unlike fixed-group
event segmentation methods, which often discard crucial temporal information,
our SNN adaptively determines the optimal event segmentation moments, ensuring
that key temporal features are extracted. The extracted event features are then
processed by CNNs for object detection.

Conclusion: ProtoMask模型通过整合图像分割基础模型，有效提升了原型案例推理方法的可解释性和可视化可靠性，在保持竞争性能的同时提供了独特的可解释性特征。

Abstract: XAI gained considerable importance in recent years. Methods based on
prototypical case-based reasoning have shown a promising improvement in
explainability. However, these methods typically rely on additional post-hoc
saliency techniques to explain the semantics of learned prototypes. Multiple
critiques have been raised about the reliability and quality of such
techniques. For this reason, we study the use of prominent image segmentation
foundation models to improve the truthfulness of the mapping between embedding
and input space. We aim to restrict the computation area of the saliency map to
a predefined semantic image patch to reduce the uncertainty of such
visualizations. To perceive the information of an entire image, we use the
bounding box from each generated segmentation mask to crop the image. Each mask
results in an individual input in our novel model architecture named ProtoMask.
We conduct experiments on three popular fine-grained classification datasets
with a wide set of metrics, providing a detailed overview on explainability
characteristics. The comparison with other popular models demonstrates
competitive performance and unique explainability features of our model.

TL;DR: MoE-SGT是一个推理驱动的框架，通过图变换器和混合专家模块增强概念瓶颈模型，在多模态输入中建模概念间结构化关系，显著提升复杂概念推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统概念瓶颈模型(CBMs)通常是单模态的，且忽略了概念间的结构化关系，无法满足复杂概念推理的需求。

Method: 构建答案-概念和答案-问题图来建模多模态输入中的结构化关系；集成图变换器捕捉多层次依赖；用混合专家模块替换前馈层，动态分配推理任务给不同子专家。

Result: 在多个数据集上，MoE-SGT比其他概念瓶颈网络实现了更高的准确率。

Conclusion: 通过建模概念间的结构化关系和利用动态专家选择机制，MoE-SGT显著提升了模型对复杂概念推理的适应能力。

Abstract: With growing demand for interpretability in deep learning, especially in high
stakes domains, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) address this by inserting
human understandable concepts into the prediction pipeline, but they are
generally single modal and ignore structured concept relationships. To overcome
these limitations, we present MoE-SGT, a reasoning driven framework that
augments CBMs with a structure injecting Graph Transformer and a Mixture of
Experts (MoE) module. We construct answer-concept and answer-question graphs
for multimodal inputs to explicitly model the structured relationships among
concepts. Subsequently, we integrate Graph Transformer to capture multi level
dependencies, addressing the limitations of traditional Concept Bottleneck
Models in modeling concept interactions. However, it still encounters
bottlenecks in adapting to complex concept patterns. Therefore, we replace the
feed forward layers with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) module, enabling the model
to have greater capacity in learning diverse concept relationships while
dynamically allocating reasoning tasks to different sub experts, thereby
significantly enhancing the model's adaptability to complex concept reasoning.
MoE-SGT achieves higher accuracy than other concept bottleneck networks on
multiple datasets by modeling structured relationships among concepts and
utilizing a dynamic expert selection mechanism.

Motivation: MLLM在细粒度感知（如高分辨率图像中的小物体识别、长视频中的关键时刻定位）方面表现不佳，现有方法依赖复杂任务特定微调，限制了泛化性并增加了模型复杂度

Method: 利用MLLM内在不确定性作为主动引导信号，核心洞察是模型在获得相关视觉信息时输出熵会降低，通过响应不确定性统一评分机制让模型自主关注最显著数据

Result: 在视觉搜索、长视频理解和时序定位三个复杂视觉任务中，现成MLLM实现了与专用微调方法相竞争的性能

Conclusion: 利用内在不确定性是增强细粒度多模态性能的强大通用策略

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often struggle with fine-grained
perception, such as identifying small objects in high-resolution images or
finding key moments in long videos. Existing works typically rely on
complicated, task-specific fine-tuning, which limits their generalizability and
increases model complexity. In this work, we propose an effective,
training-free framework that uses an MLLM's intrinsic uncertainty as a
proactive guidance signal. Our core insight is that a model's output entropy
decreases when presented with relevant visual information. We introduce a
unified mechanism that scores candidate visual inputs by response uncertainty,
enabling the model to autonomously focus on the most salient data. We apply
this simple principle to three complex visual tasks: Visual Search, Long Video
Understanding, and Temporal Grounding, allowing off-the-shelf MLLMs to achieve
performance competitive with specialized, fine-tuned methods. Our work
validates that harnessing intrinsic uncertainty is a powerful, general strategy
for enhancing fine-grained multimodal performance.

Abstract: Background: Quantitative stress perfusion cardiovascular magnetic resonance
(CMR) is a powerful tool for assessing myocardial ischemia. Motion correction
is essential for accurate pixel-wise mapping but traditional registration-based
methods are slow and sensitive to acquisition variability, limiting robustness
and scalability.
  Methods: We developed an unsupervised deep learning-based motion correction
pipeline that replaces iterative registration with efficient one-shot
estimation. The method corrects motion in three steps and uses robust principal
component analysis to reduce contrast-related effects. It aligns the perfusion
series and auxiliary images (arterial input function and proton
density-weighted series). Models were trained and validated on multivendor data
from 201 patients, with 38 held out for testing. Performance was assessed via
temporal alignment and quantitative perfusion values, compared to a previously
published registration-based method.
  Results: The deep learning approach significantly improved temporal
smoothness of time-intensity curves (p<0.001). Myocardial alignment (Dice =
0.92 (0.04) and 0.91 (0.05)) was comparable to the baseline and superior to
before registration (Dice = 0.80 (0.09), p<0.001). Perfusion maps showed
reduced motion, with lower standard deviation in the myocardium (0.52 (0.39)
ml/min/g) compared to baseline (0.55 (0.44) ml/min/g). Processing time was
reduced 15-fold.
  Conclusion: This deep learning pipeline enables fast, robust motion
correction for stress perfusion CMR, improving accuracy across dynamic and
auxiliary images. Trained on multivendor data, it generalizes across sequences
and may facilitate broader clinical adoption of quantitative perfusion imaging.

Motivation: 传统情绪预测方法（如自我评估和面部表情分析）存在主观性和模糊性问题，而完整EEG测量复杂且资源密集。本研究旨在探索使用低成本EEG设备的简化通道配置进行准确情绪预测的可能性。

Method: 使用DEAP数据集中的EEG通道子集，通过连续小波变换将EEG数据转换为尺度图，然后训练视觉变换器（ViT）模型进行情绪分类。

Result: 仅使用12个测量点（通道）就能以91.57%的准确率预测4个象限（高/低唤醒度和效价），与使用32个通道的最先进结果96.9%相比表现优异。

Conclusion: 显著减少输入通道数量仍能获得高准确率，证明了低成本EEG设备在情绪预测中的可行性和有效性。

Abstract: Accurately predicting emotions from brain signals has the potential to
achieve goals such as improving mental health, human-computer interaction, and
affective computing. Emotion prediction through neural signals offers a
promising alternative to traditional methods, such as self-assessment and
facial expression analysis, which can be subjective or ambiguous. Measurements
of the brain activity via electroencephalogram (EEG) provides a more direct and
unbiased data source. However, conducting a full EEG is a complex,
resource-intensive process, leading to the rise of low-cost EEG devices with
simplified measurement capabilities. This work examines how subsets of EEG
channels from the DEAP dataset can be used for sufficiently accurate emotion
prediction with low-cost EEG devices, rather than fully equipped
EEG-measurements. Using Continuous Wavelet Transformation to convert EEG data
into scaleograms, we trained a vision transformer (ViT) model for emotion
classification. The model achieved over 91,57% accuracy in predicting 4
quadrants (high/low per arousal and valence) with only 12 measuring points
(also referred to as channels). Our work shows clearly, that a significant
reduction of input channels yields high results compared to state-of-the-art
results of 96,9% with 32 channels. Training scripts to reproduce our code can

Result: 在严重退化情况下进行广泛实验，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架能够稳定训练，支持推理时提示优化，无需微调即可增强现有图像恢复模型。

Abstract: Blind Image Restoration (BIR) methods have achieved remarkable success but
falter when faced with Extreme Blind Image Restoration (EBIR), where inputs
suffer from severe, compounded degradations beyond their training scope.
Directly learning a mapping from extremely low-quality (ELQ) to high-quality
(HQ) images is challenging due to the massive domain gap, often leading to
unnatural artifacts and loss of detail. To address this, we propose a novel
framework that decomposes the intractable ELQ-to-HQ restoration process. We
first learn a projector that maps an ELQ image onto an intermediate,
less-degraded LQ manifold. This intermediate image is then restored to HQ using
a frozen, off-the-shelf BIR model. Our approach is grounded in information
theory; we provide a novel perspective of image restoration as an Information
Bottleneck problem and derive a theoretically-driven objective to train our
projector. This loss function effectively stabilizes training by balancing a
low-quality reconstruction term with a high-quality prior-matching term. Our
framework enables Look Forward Once (LFO) for inference-time prompt refinement,
and supports plug-and-play strengthening of existing image restoration models
without need for finetuning. Extensive experiments under severe degradation
regimes provide a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of our work.

TL;DR: 提出了MULTI-TAP，一种用于评估图像-文本对齐的多目标任务感知预测器，能够生成整体分数和细粒度多目标分数，在性能和效率上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图像-文本对齐评估缺乏综合基准，现有评估器在人类判断对齐、长序列处理、推理效率和多目标评分适用性方面存在不足。

Method: 基于大型视觉语言模型构建插件式架构，通过在预训练LVLM的冻结隐藏状态上训练轻量级岭回归层，实现多目标和单目标评分。

Result: MULTI-TAP在不同LVLM架构上表现稳健，性能显著优于现有指标，与GPT-4o基预测器G-VEval相当但模型更小（7-8B）。在EYE4ALL新数据集上优于VisionREWARD。

Conclusion: MULTI-TAP为可靠视觉语言应用开发提供了强大的评估工具，新发布的EYE4ALL数据集有助于开发更易访问的AI系统，特别是服务于盲人和低视力用户。

Abstract: Evaluating image-text alignment while reflecting human preferences across
multiple aspects is a significant issue for the development of reliable
vision-language applications. It becomes especially crucial in real-world
scenarios where multiple valid descriptions exist depending on contexts or user
needs. However, research progress is hindered by the lack of comprehensive
benchmarks and existing evaluation predictors lacking at least one of these key
properties: (1) Alignment with human judgments, (2) Long-sequence processing,
(3) Inference efficiency, and (4) Applicability to multi-objective scoring. To
address these challenges, we propose a plug-and-play architecture to build a
robust predictor, MULTI-TAP (Multi-Objective Task-Aware Predictor), capable of
both multi and single-objective scoring. MULTI-TAP can produce a single overall
score, utilizing a reward head built on top of a large vision-language model
(LVLMs). We show that MULTI-TAP is robust in terms of application to different
LVLM architectures, achieving significantly higher performance than existing
metrics and even on par with the GPT-4o-based predictor, G-VEval, with a
smaller size (7-8B). By training a lightweight ridge regression layer on the
frozen hidden states of a pre-trained LVLM, MULTI-TAP can produce fine-grained
scores for multiple human-interpretable objectives. MULTI-TAP performs better
than VisionREWARD, a high-performing multi-objective reward model, in both
performance and efficiency on multi-objective benchmarks and our newly released
text-image-to-text dataset, EYE4ALL. Our new dataset, consisting of
chosen/rejected human preferences (EYE4ALLPref) and human-annotated
fine-grained scores across seven dimensions (EYE4ALLMulti), can serve as a
foundation for developing more accessible AI systems by capturing the
underlying preferences of users, including blind and low-vision (BLV)
individuals.

*Joana C. Costa,Tiago Roxo,Hugo Proença,Pedro R. M. Inácio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种零查询黑盒对抗攻击方法ZQBA，利用深度神经网络的特征表示生成对抗样本，无需多次查询或训练扩散模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有黑盒对抗攻击需要多次查询或训练扩散模型来生成对抗样本，这限制了在现实场景中的应用。需要开发更高效的单次查询攻击方法。

Method: 从DNN获取特征图，将其添加到干净图像中，通过特征表示转移来破坏目标模型的分类性能，实现跨模型和跨数据集的对抗样本迁移。

Result: ZQBA能够将对抗样本迁移到不同模型和数据集（CIFAR和Tiny ImageNet），在单次查询下比现有黑盒攻击更有效，同时保持扰动的不可感知性。

Conclusion: ZQBA方法揭示了深度神经网络在现实应用中的脆弱性，提供了一种高效的黑盒对抗攻击方案，无需多次查询或复杂模型训练。

Abstract: Current black-box adversarial attacks either require multiple queries or
diffusion models to produce adversarial samples that can impair the target
model performance. However, these methods require training a surrogate loss or
diffusion models to produce adversarial samples, which limits their
applicability in real-world settings. Thus, we propose a Zero Query Black-box
Adversarial (ZQBA) attack that exploits the representations of Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) to fool other networks. Instead of requiring thousands of
queries to produce deceiving adversarial samples, we use the feature maps
obtained from a DNN and add them to clean images to impair the classification
of a target model. The results suggest that ZQBA can transfer the adversarial
samples to different models and across various datasets, namely CIFAR and Tiny
ImageNet. The experiments also show that ZQBA is more effective than
state-of-the-art black-box attacks with a single query, while maintaining the
imperceptibility of perturbations, evaluated both quantitatively (SSIM) and
qualitatively, emphasizing the vulnerabilities of employing DNNs in real-world
contexts. All the source code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于概念瓶颈模型第二阶段的新型不确定性感知可解释分类器，通过学习二元类级概念原型，利用概念向量与原型之间的距离作为分类分数和不确定性度量，同时增强可解释性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 概念瓶颈模型虽然提供语义可解释的分类流程，但预测性能通常低于端到端卷积神经网络，且从概念预测到最终标签决策的不确定性传播研究不足。

Method: 学习一组二元类级概念原型，使用预测概念向量与每个类原型之间的距离作为分类分数和不确定性度量，这些原型也作为可解释的分类规则。

Result: 提出的框架通过基于学习到的二元类级概念原型的偏差，为不确定或异常输入启用符合性预测，从而增强了可解释性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法在概念瓶颈模型的第二阶段提供了不确定性感知和可解释的分类，通过概念原型实现了更好的可解释性和对不确定输入的鲁棒处理。

Abstract: In the context of image classification, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs)
first embed images into a set of human-understandable concepts, followed by an
intrinsically interpretable classifier that predicts labels based on these
intermediate representations. While CBMs offer a semantically meaningful and
interpretable classification pipeline, they often sacrifice predictive
performance compared to end-to-end convolutional neural networks. Moreover, the
propagation of uncertainty from concept predictions to final label decisions
remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware and
interpretable classifier for the second stage of CBMs. Our method learns a set
of binary class-level concept prototypes and uses the distances between
predicted concept vectors and each class prototype as both a classification
score and a measure of uncertainty. These prototypes also serve as
interpretable classification rules, indicating which concepts should be present
in an image to justify a specific class prediction. The proposed framework
enhances both interpretability and robustness by enabling conformal prediction
for uncertain or outlier inputs based on their deviation from the learned
binary class-level concept prototypes.

TL;DR: 提出了MetaLogic评估框架，通过生成语义相同但语法不同的提示词对，检测文本到图像模型在语义一致性方面的鲁棒性问题，无需真实图像作为参考。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像模型在输入提示词发生微小语言变化时，难以保持语义一致性，暴露了模型在推理和泛化方面的鲁棒性不足。

Method: 利用蜕变测试方法，生成语法不同但语义相同的提示词对，通过直接比较生成的图像对来识别不一致性，从而诊断模型逻辑理解的失败。

Result: 在多个最先进的T2I模型上评估，发现Flux.dev和DALLE-3分别有59%和71%的对齐失败率，揭示了现有模型普遍存在的鲁棒性问题。

Conclusion: MetaLogic提供了一种可扩展、无需真实图像参考的评估方法，能够有效发现现有评估指标忽略的细粒度逻辑不一致问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models, especially diffusion-based
architectures, have significantly improved the visual quality of generated
images. However, these models continue to struggle with a critical limitation:
maintaining semantic consistency when input prompts undergo minor linguistic
variations. Despite being logically equivalent, such prompt pairs often yield
misaligned or semantically inconsistent images, exposing a lack of robustness
in reasoning and generalisation. To address this, we propose MetaLogic, a novel
evaluation framework that detects T2I misalignment without relying on ground
truth images. MetaLogic leverages metamorphic testing, generating image pairs
from prompts that differ grammatically but are semantically identical. By
directly comparing these image pairs, the framework identifies inconsistencies
that signal failures in preserving the intended meaning, effectively diagnosing
robustness issues in the model's logic understanding. Unlike existing
evaluation methods that compare a generated image to a single prompt, MetaLogic
evaluates semantic equivalence between paired images, offering a scalable,
ground-truth-free approach to identifying alignment failures. It categorises
these alignment errors (e.g., entity omission, duplication, positional
misalignment) and surfaces counterexamples that can be used for model debugging
and refinement. We evaluate MetaLogic across multiple state-of-the-art T2I
models and reveal consistent robustness failures across a range of logical
constructs. We find that even the SOTA text-to-image models like Flux.dev and
DALLE-3 demonstrate a 59 percent and 71 percent misalignment rate,
respectively. Our results show that MetaLogic is not only efficient and
scalable, but also effective in uncovering fine-grained logical inconsistencies
that are overlooked by existing evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Building facades represent a significant untapped resource for solar energy
generation in dense urban environments, yet assessing their photovoltaic (PV)
potential remains challenging due to complex geometries and semantic com
ponents. This study introduces SF-SPA (Semantic Facade Solar-PV Assessment), an
automated framework that transforms street-view photographs into quantitative
PV deployment assessments. The approach combines com puter vision and
artificial intelligence techniques to address three key challenges: perspective
distortion correction, semantic understanding of facade elements, and spatial
reasoning for PV layout optimization. Our four-stage pipeline processes images
through geometric rectification, zero-shot semantic segmentation, Large
Language Model (LLM) guided spatial reasoning, and energy simulation.
Validation across 80 buildings in four countries demonstrates ro bust
performance with mean area estimation errors of 6.2% &#177; 2.8% compared to
expert annotations. The auto mated assessment requires approximately 100
seconds per building, a substantial gain in efficiency over manual methods.
Simulated energy yield predictions confirm the method's reliability and

Motivation: 当前视频生成模型产生违反真实世界动力学的物理不一致运动，需要开发能够保持物理一致性的视频生成方法。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 使用视觉语言模型预测粗粒度运动轨迹以保持物理一致性；2) 通过基于注意力的机制用轨迹指导视频生成，进行细粒度运动优化。基于视频跟踪数据构建轨迹预测数据集。

Result: 在UCF-101和MSR-VTT数据集上表现优于现有方法，分别获得545和539的FVD分数。

Conclusion: TrajVLM-Gen通过物理感知的轨迹预测和注意力引导的视频生成，有效提升了视频生成的物理一致性和质量。

Abstract: Current video generation models produce physically inconsistent motion that
violates real-world dynamics. We propose TrajVLM-Gen, a two-stage framework for
physics-aware image-to-video generation. First, we employ a Vision Language
Model to predict coarse-grained motion trajectories that maintain consistency
with real-world physics. Second, these trajectories guide video generation
through attention-based mechanisms for fine-grained motion refinement. We build
a trajectory prediction dataset based on video tracking data with realistic
motion patterns. Experiments on UCF-101 and MSR-VTT demonstrate that
TrajVLM-Gen outperforms existing methods, achieving competitive FVD scores of
545 on UCF-101 and 539 on MSR-VTT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动音频描述生成工作主要关注几秒钟的剪辑片段，且通过与单一参考AD比较来评估，但AD写作具有主观性，需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 通过分析同一电影的两个独立AD轨道来量化AD的主观性，并提出ADQA基准测试，在几分钟长的连贯视频片段层面评估AD质量，包含视觉欣赏和叙事理解两类问题。

Result: 当前AD生成方法在帮助盲人和低视力用户理解故事和欣赏视觉细节方面远落后于人工创作的AD。

Conclusion: 提出了未来工作的建议，并建立了公共排行榜用于基准测试。

Abstract: Audio descriptions (ADs) narrate important visual details in movies, enabling
Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users to understand narratives and appreciate visual
details. Existing works in automatic AD generation mostly focus on few-second
trimmed clips, and evaluate them by comparing against a single ground-truth
reference AD. However, writing ADs is inherently subjective. Through alignment
and analysis of two independent AD tracks for the same movies, we quantify the
subjectivity in when and whether to describe, and what and how to highlight.
Thus, we show that working with trimmed clips is inadequate. We propose ADQA, a
QA benchmark that evaluates ADs at the level of few-minute long, coherent video
segments, testing whether they would help BLV users understand the story and
appreciate visual details. ADQA features visual appreciation (VA) questions
about visual facts and narrative understanding (NU) questions based on the
plot. Through ADQA, we show that current AD generation methods lag far behind
human-authored ADs. We conclude with several recommendations for future work
and introduce a public leaderboard for benchmarking.

Motivation: 现有的短语定位研究主要局限于单视图图像，忽略了立体视觉中丰富的几何线索，限制了多模态语义分割的发展。

Method: 基于PhraseCut数据集，利用GenStereo生成准确的右视图图像，将短语定位扩展到立体视觉领域，提供对齐的分割掩码和短语标注。

Conclusion: PhraseStereo推动了多模态学习的发展，特别是在利用深度线索进行更精确和上下文感知的定位方面，该数据集将在论文接受后公开发布。

Abstract: Understanding how natural language phrases correspond to specific regions in
images is a key challenge in multimodal semantic segmentation. Recent advances
in phrase grounding are largely limited to single-view images, neglecting the
rich geometric cues available in stereo vision. For this, we introduce
PhraseStereo, the first novel dataset that brings phrase-region segmentation to
stereo image pairs. PhraseStereo builds upon the PhraseCut dataset by
leveraging GenStereo to generate accurate right-view images from existing
single-view data, enabling the extension of phrase grounding into the stereo
domain. This new setting introduces unique challenges and opportunities for
multimodal learning, particularly in leveraging depth cues for more precise and
context-aware grounding. By providing stereo image pairs with aligned
segmentation masks and phrase annotations, PhraseStereo lays the foundation for
future research at the intersection of language, vision, and 3D perception,
encouraging the development of models that can reason jointly over semantics
and geometry. The PhraseStereo dataset will be released online upon acceptance
of this work.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NSARM是一个基于自回归模型的实时图像超分辨率框架，通过两阶段训练实现高质量、高效率的图像重建，相比现有方法具有更好的鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Real-ISR方法存在效率与质量之间的权衡：基于扩散模型的方法质量高但速度慢，直接重建的方法速度快但质量低。现有方法还容易产生过度增强的伪影和幻觉，对输入图像质量变化缺乏鲁棒性。

Method: 提出Next-Scale Autoregressive Modeling (NSARM)框架，采用两阶段训练：首先训练转换网络将低质量图像映射到初步尺度，然后进行端到端的全模型微调。基于视觉自回归模型的逐尺度预测策略。

Result: NSARM在定量和定性评估中均优于现有Real-ISR方法，在保持快速推理速度的同时获得更优的视觉效果。最重要的是，对输入图像质量具有更高的鲁棒性，表现出更强的泛化性能。

Conclusion: NSARM作为一个纯自回归模型，在Real-ISR任务中实现了视觉质量和推理效率的良好平衡，同时显著提高了对输入图像质量变化的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Most recent real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods employ
pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models to synthesize the high-quality
image either from random Gaussian noise, which yields realistic results but is
slow due to iterative denoising, or directly from the input low-quality image,
which is efficient but at the price of lower output quality. These approaches
train ControlNet or LoRA modules while keeping the pre-trained model fixed,
which often introduces over-enhanced artifacts and hallucinations, suffering
from the robustness to inputs of varying degradations. Recent visual
autoregressive (AR) models, such as pre-trained Infinity, can provide strong
T2I generation capabilities while offering superior efficiency by using the
bitwise next-scale prediction strategy. Building upon next-scale prediction, we
introduce a robust Real-ISR framework, namely Next-Scale Autoregressive
Modeling (NSARM). Specifically, we train NSARM in two stages: a transformation
network is first trained to map the input low-quality image to preliminary
scales, followed by an end-to-end full-model fine-tuning. Such a comprehensive
fine-tuning enhances the robustness of NSARM in Real-ISR tasks without
compromising its generative capability. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
evaluations demonstrate that as a pure AR model, NSARM achieves superior visual
results over existing Real-ISR methods while maintaining a fast inference
speed. Most importantly, it demonstrates much higher robustness to the quality
of input images, showing stronger generalization performance. Project page:

Motivation: 传统分类方法往往忽略不同层次间的固有类间关系，从而丢失重要的监督信号，需要更有效地利用层次结构信息。

Result: 在CIFAR100和ModelNet40数据集上，在线性评估中实现了最先进的性能，比现有层次对比学习方法在准确率上提高了2个百分点。

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式建模层次间关系和类别不平衡，实现了所有层次级别的细粒度聚类，在计算机视觉等领域具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Hierarchical classification is a crucial task in many applications, where
objects are organized into multiple levels of categories. However, conventional
classification approaches often neglect inherent inter-class relationships at
different hierarchy levels, thus missing important supervisory signals. Thus,
we propose two novel hierarchical contrastive learning (HMLC) methods. The
first, leverages a Gaussian Mixture Model (G-HMLC) and the second uses an
attention mechanism to capture hierarchy-specific features (A-HMLC), imitating
human processing. Our approach explicitly models inter-class relationships and
imbalanced class distribution at higher hierarchy levels, enabling fine-grained
clustering across all hierarchy levels. On the competitive CIFAR100 and
ModelNet40 datasets, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in linear
evaluation, outperforming existing hierarchical contrastive learning methods by
2 percentage points in terms of accuracy. The effectiveness of our approach is
backed by both quantitative and qualitative results, highlighting its potential
for applications in computer vision and beyond.

Conclusion: 世界模型继承的视频预训练中的运动一致性内部化带来了性能提升，这项工作为利用世界模型先验的新一代视觉语言模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: Trained on internet-scale video data, generative world models are
increasingly recognized as powerful world simulators that can generate
consistent and plausible dynamics over structure, motion, and physics. This
raises a natural question: with the advent of strong video foundational models,
might they supplant conventional vision encoder paradigms for general-purpose
multimodal understanding? While recent studies have begun to explore the
potential of world models on common vision tasks, these explorations typically
lack a systematic investigation of generic, multimodal tasks. In this work, we
strive to investigate the capabilities when world model priors are transferred
into Vision-Language Models: we re-purpose a video diffusion model as a
generative encoder to perform a single denoising step and treat the resulting
latents as a set of visual embedding. We empirically investigate this class of
models, which we refer to as World-Language Models (WorldLMs), and we find that
generative encoders can capture latents useful for downstream understanding
that show distinctions from conventional encoders. Naming our best-performing
variant Dynamic Vision Aligner (DyVA), we further discover that this method
significantly enhances spatial reasoning abilities and enables single-image
models to perform multi-frame reasoning. Through the curation of a suite of
visual reasoning tasks, we find DyVA to surpass both open-source and
proprietary baselines, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable performance. We
attribute these gains to WorldLM's inherited motion-consistency internalization
from video pre-training. Finally, we systematically explore extensive model
designs to highlight promising directions for future work. We hope our study
can pave the way for a new family of VLMs that leverage priors from world
models and are on a promising path towards generalist vision learners.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合移位窗口自注意力和Mamba选择性扫描的混合架构，用于视频超分辨率，通过Gather-Scatter Mamba机制减少遮挡伪影并改善信息传播。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于RNN的VSR方法存在梯度消失、缺乏并行性和推理速度慢的问题，而Transformer虽然能建模全局上下文但具有二次复杂度。Mamba提供了线性时间复杂度的替代方案，但单独使用难以捕捉细粒度空间依赖关系。

Method: 采用混合架构：移位窗口自注意力用于空间上下文聚合，Mamba选择性扫描用于高效时间传播。引入Gather-Scatter Mamba机制，在Mamba传播前将特征向中心锚帧扭曲，传播后再散射回各帧。

Result: 该方法有效减少了遮挡伪影，确保了聚合信息在所有帧间的有效重新分布，同时保持了线性时间复杂度和强长程建模能力。

Conclusion: 提出的GSMamba混合架构成功结合了自注意力的空间建模优势和Mamba的高效时间传播能力，为视频超分辨率提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs)-most notably RNNs-have historically played a
central role in sequential modeling. Although attention mechanisms such as
Transformers have since dominated due to their ability to model global context,
their quadratic complexity and limited scalability make them less suited for
long sequences. Video super-resolution (VSR) methods have traditionally relied
on recurrent architectures to propagate features across frames. However, such
approaches suffer from well-known issues including vanishing gradients, lack of
parallelism, and slow inference speed. Recent advances in selective SSMs like
Mamba offer a compelling alternative: by enabling input-dependent state
transitions with linear-time complexity, Mamba mitigates these issues while
maintaining strong long-range modeling capabilities. Despite this potential,
Mamba alone struggles to capture fine-grained spatial dependencies due to its
causal nature and lack of explicit context aggregation. To address this, we
propose a hybrid architecture that combines shifted window self-attention for
spatial context aggregation with Mamba-based selective scanning for efficient
temporal propagation. Furthermore, we introduce Gather-Scatter Mamba (GSM), an
alignment-aware mechanism that warps features toward a center anchor frame
within the temporal window before Mamba propagation and scatters them back
afterward, effectively reducing occlusion artifacts and ensuring effective
redistribution of aggregated information across all frames. The official
implementation is provided at: https://github.com/Ko-Lani/GSMamba.

Abstract: Glaucoma is a progressive eye disease that leads to optic nerve damage,
causing irreversible vision loss if left untreated. Optical coherence
tomography (OCT) has become a crucial tool for glaucoma diagnosis, offering
high-resolution 3D scans of the retina and optic nerve. However, the
conventional practice of condensing information from 3D OCT volumes into 2D
reports often results in the loss of key structural details. To address this,
we propose a novel hybrid deep learning model that integrates cross-attention
mechanisms into a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN), enabling the
extraction of critical features from the superior and inferior hemiretinas, as
well as from the optic nerve head (ONH) and macula, within OCT volumes. We
introduce Channel Attention REpresentations (CAREs) to visualize
cross-attention outputs and leverage them for consistency-based multi-task
fine-tuning, aligning them with Gradient-Weighted Class Activation Maps
(Grad-CAMs) from the CNN's final convolutional layer to enhance performance,
interpretability, and anatomical coherence. We have named this model AI-CNet3D
(AI-`See'-Net3D) to reflect its design as an Anatomically-Informed
Cross-attention Network operating on 3D data. By dividing the volume along two
axes and applying cross-attention, our model enhances glaucoma classification
by capturing asymmetries between the hemiretinal regions while integrating
information from the optic nerve head and macula. We validate our approach on
two large datasets, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art attention and
convolutional models across all key metrics. Finally, our model is
computationally efficient, reducing the parameter count by one-hundred--fold
compared to other attention mechanisms while maintaining high diagnostic
performance and comparable GFLOPS.

TL;DR: PAL-Net是一个用于3D面部扫描自动定位50个解剖标志点的深度学习管道，结合了粗对齐、感兴趣区域过滤和基于补丁的点式CNN，在精度和计算成本之间取得了良好平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动标注3D面部扫描的解剖标志点耗时且依赖专业知识，而现有深度学习方法大多关注伪标志点或需要复杂输入表示，限制了临床适用性。

Method: 结合粗对齐、感兴趣区域过滤、初始标志点近似，以及通过注意力机制增强的基于补丁的点式CNN。

Result: 在214个标注扫描上达到3.686毫米的平均定位误差，在FaceScape数据集700个对象上达到0.41毫米点误差和0.38毫米距离误差，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PAL-Net提供了一个轻量级、可扩展的高通量3D人体测量分析解决方案，有潜力支持临床工作流程并减少对人工标注的依赖。

Abstract: Manual annotation of anatomical landmarks on 3D facial scans is a
time-consuming and expertise-dependent task, yet it remains critical for
clinical assessments, morphometric analysis, and craniofacial research. While
several deep learning methods have been proposed for facial landmark
localization, most focus on pseudo-landmarks or require complex input
representations, limiting their clinical applicability. This study presents a
fully automated deep learning pipeline (PAL-Net) for localizing 50 anatomical
landmarks on stereo-photogrammetry facial models. The method combines coarse
alignment, region-of-interest filtering, and an initial approximation of
landmarks with a patch-based pointwise CNN enhanced by attention mechanisms.
Trained and evaluated on 214 annotated scans from healthy adults, PAL-Net
achieved a mean localization error of 3.686 mm and preserves relevant
anatomical distances with a 2.822 mm average error, comparable to
intra-observer variability. To assess generalization, the model was further
evaluated on 700 subjects from the FaceScape dataset, achieving a point-wise
error of 0.41\,mm and a distance-wise error of 0.38\,mm. Compared to existing
methods, PAL-Net offers a favorable trade-off between accuracy and
computational cost. While performance degrades in regions with poor mesh
quality (e.g., ears, hairline), the method demonstrates consistent accuracy
across most anatomical regions. PAL-Net generalizes effectively across datasets
and facial regions, outperforming existing methods in both point-wise and
structural evaluations. It provides a lightweight, scalable solution for
high-throughput 3D anthropometric analysis, with potential to support clinical
workflows and reduce reliance on manual annotation. Source code can be found at

Conclusion: 所提出的自监督学习策略能够有效处理单次不完整观测模型下的逆问题，为难以获取真实数据的学习重建方法提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning for inverse problems allows to train a
reconstruction network from noise and/or incomplete data alone. These methods
have the potential of enabling learning-based solutions when obtaining
ground-truth references for training is expensive or even impossible. In this
paper, we propose a new self-supervised learning strategy devised for the
challenging setting where measurements are observed via a single incomplete
observation model. We introduce a new definition of equivariance in the context
of reconstruction networks, and show that the combination of self-supervised
splitting losses and equivariant reconstruction networks results in unbiased
estimates of the supervised loss. Through a series of experiments on image
inpainting, accelerated magnetic resonance imaging, and compressive sensing, we
demonstrate that the proposed loss achieves state-of-the-art performance in
settings with highly rank-deficient forward models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级的向量平移特征对齐框架，通过建模分辨率特定的特征差异来解决跨分辨率行人重识别问题，显著优于现有方法且效率更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在监控场景中，不同相机距离导致行人图像分辨率差异显著，使得低分辨率图像难以与高分辨率图像匹配，限制了行人重识别性能。现有方法依赖超分辨率或联合学习，增加了复杂度且性能已达瓶颈。

Method: 基于语义方向在特征空间中的发现，提出向量平移特征对齐框架，通过建模分辨率特定的特征差异来进行跨分辨率行人重识别。

Result: 在多个跨分辨率行人重识别基准测试中，该方法显著优于先前的最先进基线模型，同时获得更高的效率。

Conclusion: 基于新发现的语义方向在特征空间中的存在，提出的轻量级框架在跨分辨率行人重识别任务中展现出有效性和优越性。

Abstract: In surveillance scenarios, varying camera distances cause significant
differences among pedestrian image resolutions, making it hard to match
low-resolution (LR) images with high-resolution (HR) counterparts, limiting the
performance of Re-Identification (ReID) tasks. Most existing Cross-Resolution
ReID (CR-ReID) methods rely on super-resolution (SR) or joint learning for
feature compensation, which increases training and inference complexity and has
reached a performance bottleneck in recent studies. Inspired by semantic
directions in the word embedding space, we empirically discover that semantic
directions implying resolution differences also emerge in the feature space of
ReID, and we substantiate this finding from a statistical perspective using
Canonical Correlation Analysis and Pearson Correlation Analysis. Based on this
interesting finding, we propose a lightweight and effective Vector Panning
Feature Alignment (VPFA) framework, which conducts CR-ReID from a novel
perspective of modeling the resolution-specific feature discrepancy. Extensive
experimental results on multiple CR-ReID benchmarks show that our method
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baseline models while
obtaining higher efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of
our model based on the new finding in this paper.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了InfVSR方法，将视频超分辨率重新定义为自回归单步扩散范式，实现长视频的高效超分辨率处理


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频超分辨率方法在处理长序列时面临两个挑战：多步去噪效率低，以及时间分解导致的伪影和不连续性

Method: 将预训练的DiT调整为因果结构，通过滚动KV缓存和联合视觉指导保持局部和全局一致性；将扩散过程蒸馏为单步，使用块状像素监督和跨块分布匹配

Result: 在长视频超分辨率方面达到最先进质量，语义一致性增强，相比现有方法如MGLD-VSR实现高达58倍加速

Conclusion: InfVSR突破了长视频超分辨率的限制，实现了高效可扩展的无界长度视频处理

Abstract: Real-world videos often extend over thousands of frames. Existing video
super-resolution (VSR) approaches, however, face two persistent challenges when
processing long sequences: (1) inefficiency due to the heavy cost of multi-step
denoising for full-length sequences; and (2) poor scalability hindered by
temporal decomposition that causes artifacts and discontinuities. To break
these limits, we propose InfVSR, which novelly reformulates VSR as an
autoregressive-one-step-diffusion paradigm. This enables streaming inference
while fully leveraging pre-trained video diffusion priors. First, we adapt the
pre-trained DiT into a causal structure, maintaining both local and global
coherence via rolling KV-cache and joint visual guidance. Second, we distill
the diffusion process into a single step efficiently, with patch-wise pixel
supervision and cross-chunk distribution matching. Together, these designs
enable efficient and scalable VSR for unbounded-length videos. To fill the gap
in long-form video evaluation, we build a new benchmark tailored for extended
sequences and further introduce semantic-level metrics to comprehensively
assess temporal consistency. Our method pushes the frontier of long-form VSR,
achieves state-of-the-art quality with enhanced semantic consistency, and
delivers up to 58x speed-up over existing methods such as MGLD-VSR. Code will
be available at https://github.com/Kai-Liu001/InfVSR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现代文本到图像生成中基于标记的架构难以有效融合文本和视觉标记的问题，提升条件生成的效果。

Method: 将图像和文本编码为离散标记，使用联合嵌入预测Transformer处理，加入交叉注意力进行条件去噪，并在流匹配损失前注入原始文本嵌入以改善对齐。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K评估中，JEPA-T表现出强大的数据效率和开放词汇泛化能力，始终优于非融合和后期融合基线方法。

Conclusion: 后期架构融合与目标级对齐相结合，在基于标记的文本到图像生成中提供了条件强度与骨干通用性之间的有效平衡。

Abstract: Modern Text-to-Image (T2I) generation increasingly relies on token-centric
architectures that are trained with self-supervision, yet effectively fusing
text with visual tokens remains a challenge. We propose \textbf{JEPA-T}, a
unified multimodal framework that encodes images and captions into discrete
visual and textual tokens, processed by a joint-embedding predictive
Transformer. To enhance fusion, we incorporate cross-attention after the
feature predictor for conditional denoising while maintaining a task-agnostic
backbone. Additionally, raw texts embeddings are injected prior to the flow
matching loss to improve alignment during training. During inference, the same
network performs both class-conditional and free-text image generation by
iteratively denoising visual tokens conditioned on text. Evaluations on
ImageNet-1K demonstrate that JEPA-T achieves strong data efficiency,
open-vocabulary generalization, and consistently outperforms non-fusion and
late-fusion baselines. Our approach shows that late architectural fusion
combined with objective-level alignment offers an effective balance between
conditioning strength and backbone generality in token-based T2I.The code is
now available: https://github.com/justin-herry/JEPA-T.git

Motivation: 现有视觉定位方法即使从已知相机姿态的建图图像开始，在最坏情况下仍需数小时建图时间，最好情况也要几分钟。本研究旨在探索能否在更短时间内达到竞争性精度。

Method: 将多个建图图像表示为3D空间中锚定的特征集合，利用这些建图特征预测查询图像的图像到场景对应关系，从而估计相机姿态。与图像检索相结合。

Result: 与最小建图准备时间的其他方法相比，达到了最先进的精度，并在包括挑战性大规模室外环境在内的未见领域展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: FastForward实现了快速准确的视觉定位，显著减少了建图时间需求，同时保持了竞争性精度和良好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Visually localizing an image, i.e., estimating its camera pose, requires
building a scene representation that serves as a visual map. The representation
we choose has direct consequences towards the practicability of our system.
Even when starting from mapping images with known camera poses,
state-of-the-art approaches still require hours of mapping time in the worst
case, and several minutes in the best. This work raises the question whether we
can achieve competitive accuracy much faster. We introduce FastForward, a
method that creates a map representation and relocalizes a query image
on-the-fly in a single feed-forward pass. At the core, we represent multiple
mapping images as a collection of features anchored in 3D space. FastForward
utilizes these mapping features to predict image-to-scene correspondences for
the query image, enabling the estimation of its camera pose. We couple
FastForward with image retrieval and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy when
compared to other approaches with minimal map preparation time. Furthermore,
FastForward demonstrates robust generalization to unseen domains, including
challenging large-scale outdoor environments.

Motivation: 自回归模型在序列建模中表现出色，但视觉信号的空间特性与下一个token预测的顺序依赖性存在冲突，导致次优结果。

Method: 设计一个后预训练的精炼模块，利用token间的全局上下文和关系，联合优化自回归模型生成的所有token，缓解序列生成中的错误累积问题。

Result: 实验表明该方法提高了生成质量，增强了模型产生语义一致结果的能力。

Conclusion: 该精炼模块能有效改善自回归模型在视觉语言建模中的性能，通过增强空间对应关系建模来提升生成质量。

Abstract: Autoregressive models excel in sequential modeling and have proven to be
effective for vision-language data. However, the spatial nature of visual
signals conflicts with the sequential dependencies of next-token prediction,
leading to suboptimal results. This work proposes a plug-and-play refinement
module to enhance the complex spatial correspondence modeling within the
generated visual sequence. This module operates as a post-pretraining step to
jointly refine all generated tokens of autoregressive model, enhancing
vision-language modeling under a shared sequential prediction framework. By
leveraging global context and relationship across the tokens, our method
mitigates the error accumulation issue within the sequential generation.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves the generation
quality, enhancing the model's ability to produce semantically consistent
results.

TL;DR: 提出了SoftCFG方法，通过不确定性引导的推理机制解决自回归模型中分类器自由引导的指导衰减和过度指导问题，在ImageNet 256上达到自回归模型中最优FID。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在图像生成中应用分类器自由引导时面临两个关键问题：指导衰减（条件与无条件差距随解码进展快速消失）和过度指导（强条件扭曲视觉连贯性）。

Method: 提出SoftCFG方法，通过不确定性引导的推理机制在所有序列标记上分布自适应扰动，让每个生成的标记贡献确定性加权的指导；引入步长归一化来限制SoftCFG的累积扰动。

Result: 实验表明SoftCFG在图像质量上显著优于标准CFG，在ImageNet 256上达到自回归模型中最优FID。

Conclusion: SoftCFG是一种无需训练、模型无关的方法，可无缝集成到现有自回归流程中，有效解决了CFG在自回归模型中的指导问题。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have emerged as powerful tools for image
generation by modeling images as sequences of discrete tokens. While
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has been adopted to improve conditional
generation, its application in AR models faces two key issues: guidance
diminishing, where the conditional-unconditional gap quickly vanishes as
decoding progresses, and over-guidance, where strong conditions distort visual
coherence. To address these challenges, we propose SoftCFG, an
uncertainty-guided inference method that distributes adaptive perturbations
across all tokens in the sequence. The key idea behind SoftCFG is to let each
generated token contribute certainty-weighted guidance, ensuring that the
signal persists across steps while resolving conflicts between text guidance
and visual context. To further stabilize long-sequence generation, we introduce
Step Normalization, which bounds cumulative perturbations of SoftCFG. Our
method is training-free, model-agnostic, and seamlessly integrates with
existing AR pipelines. Experiments show that SoftCFG significantly improves
image quality over standard CFG and achieves state-of-the-art FID on ImageNet
256 among autoregressive models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CAM方法虽然能突出显示影响预测的空间区域，但缺乏对这些激活区域背后语义属性的洞察，限制了模型在高风险应用中的可信度。

Method: 结合CAM的空间定位能力和视觉语言模型的语义对齐，使用CLIP嵌入和线性判别分析获得通道级语义表示，通过CAM权重聚合生成文本描述。

Result: 在ImageNet、CLEVR和CUB数据集上的实验表明，TextCAM能生成忠实且可解释的推理，提高人类理解能力，检测虚假相关性，并保持模型保真度。

Conclusion: TextCAM通过将空间注意力与语义描述相结合，为深度视觉模型提供了更丰富、更可解释的解释方法。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success across domains
but remain difficult to interpret, limiting their trustworthiness in
high-stakes applications. This paper focuses on deep vision models, for which a
dominant line of explainability methods are Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and
its variants working by highlighting spatial regions that drive predictions. We
figure out that CAM provides little semantic insight into what attributes
underlie these activations. To address this limitation, we propose TextCAM, a
novel explanation framework that enriches CAM with natural languages. TextCAM
combines the precise spatial localization of CAM with the semantic alignment of
vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, we derive channel-level semantic
representations using CLIP embeddings and linear discriminant analysis, and
aggregate them with CAM weights to produce textual descriptions of salient
visual evidence. This yields explanations that jointly specify where the model
attends and what visual attributes likely support its decision. We further
extend TextCAM to generate feature channels into semantically coherent groups,
enabling more fine-grained visual-textual explanations. Experiments on
ImageNet, CLEVR, and CUB demonstrate that TextCAM produces faithful and
interpretable rationales that improve human understanding, detect spurious
correlations, and preserve model fidelity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频问答方法虽然能处理1500+帧的长上下文，但仅对应50秒视频，信息损失严重。需要更高效的方法来处理长视频内容。

Method: 使用多种时间池化方法（混合模糊、加权平均、指数和斜坡池化）构建1fps输入，在ReasonVQA数据集上对QWEN-2.5-VL 7B进行监督微调和直接偏好优化。

Result: 在ReasonVQA数据集上，F1分数从0.212提升到0.543，BLEU-4从0.031提升到0.291，ROUGE-L从0.196提升到0.528，推理质量也显著提高。

Conclusion: 该方法在不同池化方案下都保持性能提升，表明在时间证据摘要方面具有很强的鲁棒性，在TVQA上的零样本测试也得到类似结果。

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VQA) with Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) has
gained significant traction in research ever since the Flamingo was introduced
by Deepmind. Recent advancements in large context/long video question answering
have allowed VQA tasks to have context window of 1500+ frames. However, this
only leads to 50 seconds of video footage without losing any significant
information. We introduce POVQA, a data-efficient pipeline that compresses each
second of video into a single temporally pooled image (via motion blur and
weighted averaging variants) and then align LVLMs with lightweight supervision.
Concretely, we build 1 fps input sources using Blend Blur with Last Frame,
Weighted Average, Exponential and Ramp pooling and fine-tune QWEN-2.5-VL 7B
with supervised two turn target including reasoning and final answer. We apply
Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on our
novel dataset ReasonVQA consisting of 12 movies with 239 human annotated
question-answer with reasoning prompts. On our ReasonVQA dataset, this method
dramatically improves performance over pooled baselines: F1 score improves from
0.212 to 0.543, BLEU-4 from 0.031 to 0.291, and ROUGE-L from 0.196 to 0.528.
Rationale quality also significantly increases. Cross-evaluation of SFT + DPO
on various pooling functions show that the gains persist regardless of the
pooling scheme used at train or test time, indicating strong robustness on
summarization of temporal evidence. Similar observations were made on zero-shot
in TVQA.

Motivation: 现有的文本到图像模型评估方法通常使用单一标量量化生成图像质量，无法提供全面且可解释的反馈。

Conclusion: ImageDoctor作为评估指标有效，并能显著提升文本到图像模型的生成质量。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models has increased the need
for reliable human preference modeling, a demand further amplified by recent
progress in reinforcement learning for preference alignment. However, existing
approaches typically quantify the quality of a generated image using a single
scalar, limiting their ability to provide comprehensive and interpretable
feedback on image quality. To address this, we introduce ImageDoctor, a unified
multi-aspect T2I model evaluation framework that assesses image quality across
four complementary dimensions: plausibility, semantic alignment, aesthetics,
and overall quality. ImageDoctor also provides pixel-level flaw indicators in
the form of heatmaps, which highlight misaligned or implausible regions, and
can be used as a dense reward for T2I model preference alignment. Inspired by
the diagnostic process, we improve the detail sensitivity and reasoning
capability of ImageDoctor by introducing a "look-think-predict" paradigm, where
the model first localizes potential flaws, then generates reasoning, and
finally concludes the evaluation with quantitative scores. Built on top of a
vision-language model and trained through a combination of supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, ImageDoctor demonstrates strong
alignment with human preference across multiple datasets, establishing its
effectiveness as an evaluation metric. Furthermore, when used as a reward model
for preference tuning, ImageDoctor significantly improves generation quality --
achieving an improvement of 10% over scalar-based reward models.

Conclusion: AT-RA方法有效解决了高光谱数据特有的挑战，显著提升了高光谱分类模型的对抗鲁棒性，同时保持了良好的分类性能。

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that hyperspectral classification models based
on deep learning are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which pose
significant security risks. Although several approaches have attempted to
enhance adversarial robustness by modifying network architectures, these
methods often rely on customized designs that limit scalability and fail to
defend effectively against strong attacks. To address these challenges, we
introduce adversarial training to the hyperspectral domain, which is widely
regarded as one of the most effective defenses against adversarial attacks.
Through extensive empirical analyses, we demonstrate that while adversarial
training does enhance robustness across various models and datasets,
hyperspectral data introduces unique challenges not seen in RGB images.
Specifically, we find that adversarial noise and the non-smooth nature of
adversarial examples can distort or eliminate important spectral semantic
information. To mitigate this issue, we employ data augmentation techniques and
propose a novel hyperspectral adversarial training method, termed AT-RA. By
increasing the diversity of spectral information and ensuring spatial
smoothness, AT-RA preserves and corrects spectral semantics in hyperspectral
images. Experimental results show that AT-RA improves adversarial robustness by
21.34% against AutoAttack and 18.78% against PGD-50 while boosting benign
accuracy by 2.68%.

Abstract: Face images processed by computer vision algorithms contain sensitive
personal information that malicious actors can capture without consent. These
privacy and security risks highlight the need for effective face anonymization
methods. Current methods struggle to propose a good trade-off between a secure
scheme with high-quality image generation and reversibility for later person
authentication. Diffusion-based approaches produce high-quality anonymized
images but lack the secret key mechanism to ensure that only authorized parties
can reverse the process. In this paper, we introduce, to our knowledge, the
first secure, high-quality reversible anonymization method based on a diffusion
model. We propose to combine the secret key with the latent faces
representation of the diffusion model. To preserve identity-irrelevant
features, generation is constrained by a facial mask, maintaining high-quality
images. By using a deterministic forward and backward diffusion process, our
approach enforces that the original face can be recovered with the correct
secret key. We also show that the proposed method produces anonymized faces
that are less visually similar to the original faces, compared to other
previous work.

Conclusion: ADD框架通过协调机制成功在离散空间中实现了真正的扩散特性，在分类和生成任务上都取得了显著提升。

Abstract: We propose an Authentic Discrete Diffusion (ADD) framework that fundamentally
redefines prior pseudo-discrete approaches by preserving core diffusion
characteristics directly in the one-hot space through a suite of coordinated
mechanisms. Unlike conventional "pseudo" discrete diffusion (PDD) methods, ADD
reformulates the diffusion input by directly using float-encoded one-hot class
data, without relying on diffusing in the continuous latent spaces or masking
policies. At its core, a timestep-conditioned cross-entropy loss is introduced
between the diffusion model's outputs and the original one-hot labels. This
synergistic design establishes a bridge between discriminative and generative
learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ADD not only achieves superior
performance on classification tasks compared to the baseline, but also exhibits
excellent text generation capabilities on Image captioning. Extensive ablations
validate the measurable gains of each component.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Instant4D是一个单目重建系统，使用原生4D表示从非标定视频中快速重建动态场景，在几分钟内完成处理，无需标定相机或深度传感器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态视图合成已有显著进展，但从非标定、随意拍摄的视频中重建场景仍然具有挑战性，因为优化速度慢且参数估计复杂。

Method: 通过深度视觉SLAM进行几何恢复，然后通过网格剪枝优化场景表示，引入简化的4D高斯表示高效处理时间动态。

Result: 显著减少冗余同时保持几何完整性，模型大小降至原尺寸的10%以下，实现30倍加速，训练时间缩短至2分钟内，在多个基准测试中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法在Dycheck数据集上10分钟内重建单个视频，或处理典型200帧视频，并成功应用于野外视频，展示了其泛化能力。

Abstract: Dynamic view synthesis has seen significant advances, yet reconstructing
scenes from uncalibrated, casual video remains challenging due to slow
optimization and complex parameter estimation. In this work, we present
Instant4D, a monocular reconstruction system that leverages native 4D
representation to efficiently process casual video sequences within minutes,
without calibrated cameras or depth sensors. Our method begins with geometric
recovery through deep visual SLAM, followed by grid pruning to optimize scene
representation. Our design significantly reduces redundancy while maintaining
geometric integrity, cutting model size to under 10% of its original footprint.
To handle temporal dynamics efficiently, we introduce a streamlined 4D Gaussian
representation, achieving a 30x speed-up and reducing training time to within
two minutes, while maintaining competitive performance across several
benchmarks. Our method reconstruct a single video within 10 minutes on the
Dycheck dataset or for a typical 200-frame video. We further apply our model to
in-the-wild videos, showcasing its generalizability. Our project website is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EvoWorld是一个结合全景视频生成与演化3D记忆的世界模型，通过单张全景图像输入生成未来视频帧，利用演化3D重建作为空间引导，显著提升视觉真实性和几何一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类在先前体验过的3D环境中进行心理探索和回放的能力启发，旨在实现空间一致的长时程探索。

Method: 首先通过具有细粒度视角控制的视频生成器生成未来视频帧，然后使用前馈即插即用transformer演化场景的3D重建，最后基于演化3D记忆的几何重投影合成未来帧。

Result: 在合成户外环境、Habitat室内场景和真实世界场景的基准测试中，演化3D记忆显著改善了视觉保真度并保持了空间场景一致性。

Conclusion: EvoWorld代表了向长时程空间一致世界建模的重要进展，演化3D记忆作为显式空间引导显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Humans possess a remarkable ability to mentally explore and replay 3D
environments they have previously experienced. Inspired by this mental process,
we present EvoWorld: a world model that bridges panoramic video generation with
evolving 3D memory to enable spatially consistent long-horizon exploration.
Given a single panoramic image as input, EvoWorld first generates future video
frames by leveraging a video generator with fine-grained view control, then
evolves the scene's 3D reconstruction using a feedforward plug-and-play
transformer, and finally synthesizes futures by conditioning on geometric
reprojections from this evolving explicit 3D memory. Unlike prior
state-of-the-arts that synthesize videos only, our key insight lies in
exploiting this evolving 3D reconstruction as explicit spatial guidance for the
video generation process, projecting the reconstructed geometry onto target
viewpoints to provide rich spatial cues that significantly enhance both visual
realism and geometric consistency. To evaluate long-range exploration
capabilities, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark spanning synthetic
outdoor environments, Habitat indoor scenes, and challenging real-world
scenarios, with particular emphasis on loop-closure detection and spatial
coherence over extended trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our evolving 3D memory substantially improves visual fidelity and maintains
spatial scene coherence compared to existing approaches, representing a
significant advance toward long-horizon spatially consistent world modeling.

TL;DR: IMAGEdit是一个无需训练的视频多主体编辑框架，通过多模态对齐和掩码重定向模块，能够同时编辑任意数量的视频主体，无需微调或重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法在多主体场景下存在多模态条件不足和掩码边界纠缠问题，限制了实际应用范围。

Method: 使用提示引导的多模态对齐模块生成多模态信息，结合基于先验的掩码重定向模块生成精确掩码序列，然后输入到预训练的掩码驱动视频生成模型中。

Result: 在新建的多主体基准MSVBench上，IMAGEdit持续超越最先进方法，展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: IMAGEdit显著扩展了视频编辑的适用性，兼容任何掩码驱动视频生成模型，并显著提升整体性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we present IMAGEdit, a training-free framework for any number
of video subject editing that manipulates the appearances of multiple
designated subjects while preserving non-target regions, without finetuning or
retraining. We achieve this by providing robust multimodal conditioning and
precise mask sequences through a prompt-guided multimodal alignment module and
a prior-based mask retargeting module. We first leverage large models'
understanding and generation capabilities to produce multimodal information and
mask motion sequences for multiple subjects across various types. Then, the
obtained prior mask sequences are fed into a pretrained mask-driven video
generation model to synthesize the edited video. With strong generalization
capability, IMAGEdit remedies insufficient prompt-side multimodal conditioning
and overcomes mask boundary entanglement in videos with any number of subjects,
thereby significantly expanding the applicability of video editing. More
importantly, IMAGEdit is compatible with any mask-driven video generation
model, significantly improving overall performance. Extensive experiments on
our newly constructed multi-subject benchmark MSVBench verify that IMAGEdit
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Code, models, and datasets are

*Kajwan Ziaoddini*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 该研究通过结合基于内容的音乐分析和轻量级歌词网络视角，分析了在线社区中音乐符号的生产和传播。研究发现过去十年能量下降、舞蹈性上升，不同音乐风格的情绪特征差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在理解在线社区中音乐符号的生产和传播机制，通过整合音乐内容和歌词网络分析来揭示主流音乐的演变趋势。

Method: 使用包含275首热门歌曲的语料库，结合音频描述符（能量、舞蹈性、响度等）和完整歌词转录，构建可复现的分析流程，包括量化声学属性趋势、建模词汇显著性和共现、按流派分析情绪。

Result: 发现能量十年间从79降至58，舞蹈性从59升至73；情绪在2013年达到峰值63，2014-2016年降至42后部分恢复；R&B情绪最高（96），拉丁/雷鬼顿最低（37）；歌词分析显示代词主导的词汇和密集的共现结构。

Conclusion: 主流音乐呈现出边缘化编码的主流化趋势，商业偏好转向放松但节奏感强的制作。方法上贡献了整合音乐信息检索和网络分析的工作流程，适用于社交感知推荐和社区扩散研究。

Abstract: This paper examines how musical symbolism is produced and circulated in
online communities by combining content-based music analysis with a lightweight
network perspective on lyrics. Using a curated corpus of 275 chart-topping
songs enriched with audio descriptors (energy, danceability, loudness,
liveness, valence, acousticness, speechiness, popularity) and full lyric
transcripts, we build a reproducible pipeline that (i) quantifies temporal
trends in sonic attributes, (ii) models lexical salience and co-occurrence, and
(iii) profiles mood by genre. We find a decade-long decline in energy (79 ->
58) alongside a rise in danceability (59 -> 73); valence peaks in 2013 (63) and
dips in 2014-2016 (42) before partially recovering. Correlation analysis shows
strong coupling of energy with loudness (r = 0.74) and negative associations
for acousticness with both energy (r = -0.54) and loudness (r = -0.51);
danceability is largely orthogonal to other features (|r| < 0.20). Lyric
tokenization (>114k tokens) reveals a pronoun-centric lexicon "I/you/me/my" and
a dense co-occurrence structure in which interpersonal address anchors
mainstream narratives. Mood differs systematically by style: R&B exhibits the
highest mean valence (96), followed by K-Pop/Pop (77) and Indie/Pop (70),
whereas Latin/Reggaeton is lower (37) despite high danceability. Read through a
subcultural identity lens, these patterns suggest the mainstreaming of
previously peripheral codes and a commercial preference for relaxed yet
rhythmically engaging productions that sustain collective participation without
maximal intensity. Methodologically, we contribute an integrated
MIR-plus-network workflow spanning summary statistics, correlation structure,
lexical co-occurrence matrices, and genre-wise mood profiling that is robust to
modality sparsity and suitable for socially aware recommendation or
community-level diffusion studies.

### [99] [Temporal-Aware Iterative Speech Model for Dementia Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00030)
*Chukwuemeka Ugwu,Oluwafemi Oyeleke*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: TAI-Speech是一个用于痴呆检测的时间感知迭代框架，通过动态建模自发语音来捕捉认知衰退的早期指标，在DementiaBank数据集上取得了0.839的AUC和80.6%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于语音的痴呆检测方法通常依赖静态特征或聚合的语言内容，缺乏对语音产生过程中微妙、渐进性退化的建模能力，无法捕捉认知衰退的关键早期动态时间模式。

Method: 1) 光流启发的迭代细化：将频谱图视为序列帧，使用卷积GRU捕捉声学特征的细粒度帧间演化；2) 基于交叉注意力的韵律对齐：动态对齐频谱特征与韵律模式（如音高和停顿），创建与功能衰退相关的语音产生缺陷的丰富表示。

Result: 在DementiaBank数据集上的实验结果显示，TAI-Speech实现了0.839的AUC和80.6%的准确率，优于不依赖ASR的基于文本的基线方法。

Conclusion: TAI-Speech提供了一个更灵活和鲁棒的自动化认知评估解决方案，直接基于原始音频的动态特性进行操作，能够更好地检测认知标记。

Abstract: Deep learning systems often struggle with processing long sequences, where
computational complexity can become a bottleneck. Current methods for automated
dementia detection using speech frequently rely on static, time-agnostic
features or aggregated linguistic content, lacking the flexibility to model the
subtle, progressive deterioration inherent in speech production. These
approaches often miss the dynamic temporal patterns that are critical early
indicators of cognitive decline. In this paper, we introduce TAI-Speech, a
Temporal Aware Iterative framework that dynamically models spontaneous speech
for dementia detection. The flexibility of our method is demonstrated through
two key innovations: 1) Optical Flow-inspired Iterative Refinement: By treating
spectrograms as sequential frames, this component uses a convolutional GRU to
capture the fine-grained, frame-to-frame evolution of acoustic features. 2)
Cross-Attention Based Prosodic Alignment: This component dynamically aligns
spectral features with prosodic patterns, such as pitch and pauses, to create a
richer representation of speech production deficits linked to functional
decline (IADL). TAI-Speech adaptively models the temporal evolution of each
utterance, enhancing the detection of cognitive markers. Experimental results
on the DementiaBank dataset show that TAI-Speech achieves a strong AUC of 0.839
and 80.6\% accuracy, outperforming text-based baselines without relying on ASR.
Our work provides a more flexible and robust solution for automated cognitive
assessment, operating directly on the dynamics of raw audio.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多导睡眠图检测睡眠呼吸暂停成本高、耗时长，不适合大规模筛查，需要寻找更便捷的替代方案。

Method: 将呼吸音频转换为频谱图，对呼吸暂停片段进行过采样平衡数据集，应用类别权重减少多数类偏差。

Result: 模型在呼吸暂停检测方面召回率达到90.55%，虽然精确度较低，但成功识别了大多数呼吸暂停事件。

Conclusion: 该方法有潜力作为低成本筛查工具，可在家庭或基础临床环境中使用，帮助早期识别有风险个体。

Abstract: Sleep apnea is a serious sleep-related breathing disorder that is common and
can impact health if left untreated. Currently the traditional method for
screening and diagnosis is overnight polysomnography. Polysomnography is
expensive and takes a lot of time, and is not practical for screening large
groups of people. In this paper, we explored a more accessible option, using
respiratory audio recordings to spot signs of apnea.We utilized 18 audio
files.The approach involved converting breathing sounds into spectrograms,
balancing the dataset by oversampling apnea segments, and applying class
weights to reduce bias toward the majority class. The model reached a recall of
90.55 for apnea detection. Intentionally, prioritizing catching apnea events
over general accuracy. Despite low precision,the high recall suggests potential
as a low-cost screening tool that could be used at home or in basic clinical
setups, potentially helping identify at-risk individuals much earlier.

Result: 为2025年LRAC挑战赛的两个赛道（透明编解码器和增强编解码器）提供了官方基线系统。

Conclusion: 提出了适用于低资源环境的神经音频编码基线解决方案，为后续研究提供了基准和参考框架。

Abstract: The Low-Resource Audio Codec (LRAC) Challenge aims to advance neural audio
coding for deployment in resource-constrained environments. The first edition
focuses on low-resource neural speech codecs that must operate reliably under
everyday noise and reverberation, while satisfying strict constraints on
computational complexity, latency, and bitrate. Track 1 targets transparency
codecs, which aim to preserve the perceptual transparency of input speech under
mild noise and reverberation. Track 2 addresses enhancement codecs, which
combine coding and compression with denoising and dereverberation. This paper
presents the official baseline systems for both tracks in the 2025 LRAC
Challenge. The baselines are convolutional neural codec models with Residual
Vector Quantization, trained end-to-end using a combination of adversarial and
reconstruction objectives. We detail the data filtering and augmentation
strategies, model architectures, optimization procedures, and checkpoint
selection criteria.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法难以在抑制混响的同时保持人声清晰度，而联合预测幅度和相位的方法计算成本过高，无法满足实时应用需求

Method: 使用U-Net架构在STFT域预测残差混响掩码，结合二元交叉熵、残差幅度重建和时域一致性的混合目标函数

Result: 实现了低延迟去混响，适用于真实世界的语音和歌唱应用

Conclusion: 该方法在准确性和效率之间取得了良好平衡，为实时音频处理提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Vocal dereverberation remains a challenging task in audio processing,
particularly for real-time applications where both accuracy and efficiency are
crucial. Traditional deep learning approaches often struggle to suppress
reverberation without degrading vocal clarity, while recent methods that
jointly predict magnitude and phase have significant computational cost. We
propose a real-time dereverberation framework based on residual mask prediction
in the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) domain. A U-Net architecture is
trained to estimate a residual reverberation mask that suppresses late
reflections while preserving direct speech components. A hybrid objective
combining binary cross-entropy, residual magnitude reconstruction, and
time-domain consistency further encourages both accurate suppression and
perceptual quality. Together, these components enable low-latency
dereverberation suitable for real-world speech and singing applications.

Conclusion: AS-KVHS是低延迟符号音乐生成的有效解决方案，同时发布了性能匹敌或超越最先进模型的SAGE-Music基准

Abstract: Low-latency symbolic music generation is essential for real-time
improvisation and human-AI co-creation. Existing transformer-based models,
however, face a trade-off between inference speed and musical quality.
Traditional acceleration techniques such as embedding pooling significantly
degrade quality, while recently proposed Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) methods -
though effective on single-track piano data - suffer large performance drops in
multi-track settings, as revealed by our analysis. We propose
Attribute-Specialized Key-Value Head Sharing (AS-KVHS), adapted to music's
structured symbolic representation, achieving about 30% inference speedup with
only a negligible (about 0.4%) quality drop in objective evaluations and slight
improvements in subjective listening tests. Our main contributions are (1) the
first systematic study of BPE's generalizability in multi-track symbolic music,
and (2) the introduction of AS-KVHS for low-latency symbolic music generation.
Beyond these, we also release SAGE-Music, an open-source benchmark that matches

Abstract: Recently, an increasing number of multimodal (text and audio) benchmarks have
emerged, primarily focusing on evaluating models' understanding capability.
However, exploration into assessing generative capabilities remains limited,
especially for open-ended long-form content generation. Significant challenges
lie in no reference standard answer, no unified evaluation metrics and
uncontrollable human judgments. In this work, we take podcast-like audio
generation as a starting point and propose PodEval, a comprehensive and
well-designed open-source evaluation framework. In this framework: 1) We
construct a real-world podcast dataset spanning diverse topics, serving as a
reference for human-level creative quality. 2) We introduce a multimodal
evaluation strategy and decompose the complex task into three dimensions: text,
speech and audio, with different evaluation emphasis on "Content" and "Format".
3) For each modality, we design corresponding evaluation methods, involving
both objective metrics and subjective listening test. We leverage
representative podcast generation systems (including open-source, close-source,
and human-made) in our experiments. The results offer in-depth analysis and
insights into podcast generation, demonstrating the effectiveness of PodEval in
evaluating open-ended long-form audio. This project is open-source to

Conclusion: 该方法能有效捕捉复杂声学模式和时序依赖，在生态保护和监测中具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Automated birdsong classification is essential for advancing ecological
monitoring and biodiversity studies. Despite recent progress, existing methods
often depend heavily on labeled data, use limited feature representations, and
overlook temporal dynamics essential for accurate species identification. In
this work, we propose a self-supervised contrastive network, ARIONet (Acoustic
Representation for Interframe Objective Network), that jointly optimizes
contrastive classification and future frame prediction using augmented audio
representations. The model simultaneously integrates multiple complementary
audio features within a transformer-based encoder model. Our framework is
designed with two key objectives: (1) to learn discriminative species-specific
representations for contrastive learning through maximizing similarity between
augmented views of the same audio segment while pushing apart different
samples, and (2) to model temporal dynamics by predicting future audio frames,
both without requiring large-scale annotations. We validate our framework on
four diverse birdsong datasets, including the British Birdsong Dataset, Bird
Song Dataset, and two extended Xeno-Canto subsets (A-M and N-Z). Our method
consistently outperforms existing baselines and achieves classification
accuracies of 98.41%, 93.07%, 91.89%, and 91.58%, and F1-scores of 97.84%,
94.10%, 91.29%, and 90.94%, respectively. Furthermore, it demonstrates low mean
absolute errors and high cosine similarity, up to 95%, in future frame
prediction tasks. Extensive experiments further confirm the effectiveness of
our self-supervised learning strategy in capturing complex acoustic patterns
and temporal dependencies, as well as its potential for real-world
applicability in ecological conservation and monitoring.

TL;DR: 研究发现无关音频（包括静音、合成噪声和环境声音）会干扰大型音频语言模型在文本推理任务中的表现，降低准确性并增加预测波动性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型音频语言模型在嘈杂现实环境中的鲁棒性，特别是当音频对文本推理任务不必要时，模型如何受到无关音频的干扰。

Method: 在三个文本基准测试中，测试了不同类型无关音频（静音、合成噪声、环境声音）对模型性能的影响，并分析了干扰程度与音频持续时间、振幅和解码温度的关系。

Result: 即使是非信息性音频也会降低模型准确性并增加预测波动性；静音与合成噪声的干扰程度相当；较大模型显示更强韧性但漏洞仍然存在；提示策略效果有限，自一致性可改善稳定性但增加计算成本。

Conclusion: 跨模态干扰是鲁棒性的关键挑战，需要开发能保持推理性能的高效融合策略来应对无关输入。

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) unify speech and text processing, but
their robustness in noisy real-world settings remains underexplored. We
investigate how irrelevant audio, such as silence, synthetic noise, and
environmental sounds, affects text reasoning tasks where audio is unnecessary.
Across three text-based benchmarks, we find that even non-informative audio
reduces accuracy and increases prediction volatility; the severity of
interference scales with longer durations, higher amplitudes, and elevated
decoding temperatures. Silence, often assumed neutral, destabilizes outputs as
strongly as synthetic noise. While larger models show greater resilience,
vulnerabilities persist across all evaluated systems. We further test
mitigation strategies and find that prompting shows limited effectiveness,
whereas self-consistency improves stability at the cost of increased
computation. Our results reveal cross-modal interference as a key robustness
challenge and highlight the need for efficient fusion strategies that preserve
reasoning performance in the presence of irrelevant inputs.

Motivation: 研究大型音频-语言模型在推理任务中是否受到答案选项顺序的影响，这种选择偏差会削弱模型的可靠性。

Method: 在三个广泛使用的基准测试及其口语版本上对六个大型音频-语言模型进行广泛实验，通过打乱答案选项顺序来评估偏差影响，并研究基于排列的策略来缓解偏差。

Result: 所有模型都存在这种偏差，打乱选项顺序可导致性能波动高达24%，甚至改变模型排名，基于排列的策略在大多数情况下能有效缓解偏差。

Conclusion: 这是对大型音频-语言模型中该问题的首次系统研究，揭示了当前评估实践可靠性的问题，希望提高认识并推动该方向的进一步研究。

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) are often used in tasks that involve
reasoning over ordered options. An open question is whether their predictions
are influenced by the order of answer choices, which would indicate a form of
selection bias and undermine their reliability. In this paper, we identify and
analyze this problem in LALMs. We demonstrate that no model is immune to this
bias through extensive experiments on six LALMs across three widely used
benchmarks and their spoken counterparts. Shuffling the order of answer options
can cause performance fluctuations of up to 24% and even change model rankings,
raising concerns about the reliability of current evaluation practices. We also
study permutation-based strategies and show that they can mitigate bias in most
cases. Our work represents the first systematic investigation of this issue in
LALMs, and we hope it raises awareness and motivates further research in this
direction.

Conclusion: SpeechLMScore提供了一种有效的参考无关语音严重性评估方案，在噪声环境下表现优异，为语音障碍评估提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Speech severity evaluation is becoming increasingly important as the economic
burden of speech disorders grows. Current speech severity models often struggle
with generalization, learning dataset-specific acoustic cues rather than
meaningful correlates of speech severity. Furthermore, many models require
reference speech or a transcript, limiting their applicability in ecologically
valid scenarios, such as spontaneous speech evaluation. Previous research
indicated that automatic speech naturalness evaluation scores correlate
strongly with severity evaluation scores, leading us to explore a
reference-free method, SpeechLMScore, which does not rely on pathological
speech data. Additionally, we present the NKI-SpeechRT dataset, based on the
NKI-CCRT dataset, to provide a more comprehensive foundation for speech
severity evaluation. This study evaluates whether SpeechLMScore outperforms
traditional acoustic feature-based approaches and assesses the performance gap
between reference-free and reference-based models. Moreover, we examine the
impact of noise on these models by utilizing subjective noise ratings in the
NKI-SpeechRT dataset. The results demonstrate that SpeechLMScore is robust to
noise and offers superior performance compared to traditional approaches.

TL;DR: 提出XPPG-PCA方法，一种无监督、无参考的语音病理严重程度评估方法，在荷兰口腔癌数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前依赖言语病理学专家评估存在主观性、耗时且成本高的问题，现有自动化方法也有各种局限，需要更可靠的评估方案。

Method: 使用x-vector语音后验图主成分分析(XPPG-PCA)，这是一种无监督、无参考的方法。

Result: 在三个荷兰口腔癌数据集上，XPPG-PCA表现与现有参考方法相当或更好，且对数据捷径和噪声具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: XPPG-PCA为语音病理客观评估提供了稳健、可泛化的解决方案，有望显著提高临床评估的效率和可靠性。

Abstract: Reliably evaluating the severity of a speech pathology is crucial in
healthcare. However, the current reliance on expert evaluations by
speech-language pathologists presents several challenges: while their
assessments are highly skilled, they are also subjective, time-consuming, and
costly, which can limit the reproducibility of clinical studies and place a
strain on healthcare resources. While automated methods exist, they have
significant drawbacks. Reference-based approaches require transcriptions or
healthy speech samples, restricting them to read speech and limiting their
applicability. Existing reference-free methods are also flawed; supervised
models often learn spurious shortcuts from data, while handcrafted features are
often unreliable and restricted to specific speech tasks. This paper introduces
XPPG-PCA (x-vector phonetic posteriorgram principal component analysis), a
novel, unsupervised, reference-free method for speech severity evaluation.
Using three Dutch oral cancer datasets, we demonstrate that XPPG-PCA performs
comparably to, or exceeds established reference-based methods. Our experiments
confirm its robustness against data shortcuts and noise, showing its potential
for real-world clinical use. Taken together, our results show that XPPG-PCA
provides a robust, generalizable solution for the objective assessment of
speech pathology, with the potential to significantly improve the efficiency
and reliability of clinical evaluations across a range of disorders. An
open-source implementation is available.

TL;DR: 提出了MOS-RMBench基准，将多种MOS数据集转化为偏好比较设置，并系统评估了三种奖励建模范式，发现标量模型表现最佳，但所有模型在合成语音和小MOS差异对上都表现较差。提出了MOS感知生成奖励模型来改善细粒度质量判别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语音质量评估依赖人工主观评分（如MOS），存在标注不一致、可复现性差等问题，需要更严谨和可扩展的自动评估方法。

Method: 构建MOS-RMBench基准，系统评估标量奖励模型、半标量奖励模型和生成奖励模型（GRM）三种范式，并提出MOS感知GRM，通过基于MOS差异的奖励函数自适应调整奖励。

Result: 标量模型整体表现最强（准确率超过74%）；大多数模型在合成语音上表现显著差于人类语音；所有模型在MOS差异很小的样本对上表现困难；MOS感知GRM显著改善了细粒度质量判别能力。

Conclusion: 该工作为自动语音质量评估建立了基准和方法框架，促进了更严谨和可扩展的研究，MOS感知GRM在最具挑战性的案例上缩小了与标量模型的差距。

Abstract: Assessing the perceptual quality of synthetic speech is crucial for guiding
the development and refinement of speech generation models. However, it has
traditionally relied on human subjective ratings such as the Mean Opinion Score
(MOS), which depend on manual annotations and often suffer from inconsistent
rating standards and poor reproducibility. To address these limitations, we
introduce MOS-RMBench, a unified benchmark that reformulates diverse MOS
datasets into a preference-comparison setting, enabling rigorous evaluation
across different datasets. Building on MOS-RMBench, we systematically construct
and evaluate three paradigms for reward modeling: scalar reward models,
semi-scalar reward models, and generative reward models (GRMs). Our experiments
reveal three key findings: (1) scalar models achieve the strongest overall
performance, consistently exceeding 74% accuracy; (2) most models perform
considerably worse on synthetic speech than on human speech; and (3) all models
struggle on pairs with very small MOS differences. To improve performance on
these challenging pairs, we propose a MOS-aware GRM that incorporates an
MOS-difference-based reward function, enabling the model to adaptively scale
rewards according to the difficulty of each sample pair. Experimental results
show that the MOS-aware GRM significantly improves fine-grained quality
discrimination and narrows the gap with scalar models on the most challenging
cases. We hope this work will establish both a benchmark and a methodological
framework to foster more rigorous and scalable research in automatic speech
quality assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有12.5Hz低帧率音频编解码器在进一步降低帧率时面临语义信息丢失的挑战，需要开发更低帧率且能保持语义完整性的编解码器。

Method: 采用动态帧率方法，通过自适应合并语义相似帧来减少信息稀疏区域的帧数；使用ASR特征辅助的双流编码和Transformer瓶颈架构。

Result: 在6.25Hz、8.3Hz和12.5Hz平均帧率下，FlexiCodec在语义信息保留和音频重建质量方面均优于基线系统，并在基于语言模型的TTS中验证了有效性。

Conclusion: FlexiCodec通过动态帧率方法成功解决了极低帧率下的语义信息丢失问题，实现了可控制的帧率范围和高性能的音频编解码。

Abstract: Neural audio codecs are foundational to speech language models. It is
expected to have a low frame rate and decoupled semantic and acoustic
information. A lower frame rate codec can reduce the computational cost of
speech language models by shortening the sequence length. Recent studies have
developed 12.5Hz low-frame-rate audio codecs, but even lower frame rate codecs
remain underexplored. We find that a major challenge for very low frame rate
tokens is missing semantic information. This paper introduces FlexiCodec to
address this limitation. FlexiCodec improves semantic preservation with a
dynamic frame rate approach and introduces a novel architecture featuring an
ASR feature-assisted dual stream encoding and Transformer bottlenecks. With
dynamic frame rates, it uses less frames at information-sparse regions through
adaptively merging semantically similar frames. A dynamic frame rate also
allows FlexiCodec to support inference-time controllable frame rates between
3Hz and 12.5Hz. Experiments on 6.25Hz, 8.3Hz and 12.5Hz average frame rates
confirm that FlexiCodec excels over baseline systems in semantic information
preservation and delivers a high audio reconstruction quality. We also validate
the effectiveness of FlexiCodec in language model-based TTS. Demos are

Motivation: HVAC系统中的压力传感器对声压敏感，可能成为窃听源，需要研究从这些传感器数据中重建语音的方法。

Method: 采用复数变换器（complex-valued conformer）和复数统一注意力块（Complex Unified Attention Block）来捕捉音素依赖关系，并重建缺失频率的幅度和相位以减轻瞬态HVAC噪声。

Conclusion: HVAC-EAR首次在真实HVAC部署中展示了显著的语音可理解性重建能力，这引发了新的隐私安全问题。

Abstract: Pressure sensors are widely integrated into modern Heating, Ventilation and
Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. As they are sensitive to acoustic pressure,
they can be a source of eavesdropping. This paper introduces HVAC-EAR, which
reconstructs intelligible speech from low-resolution, noisy pressure data with
two key contributions: (i) We achieve intelligible reconstruction from as low
as 0.5 kHz sampling rate, surpassing prior work limited to hot word detection,
by employing a complex-valued conformer with a Complex Unified Attention Block
to capture phoneme dependencies; (ii) HVAC-EAR mitigates transient HVAC noise
by reconstructing both magnitude and phase of missing frequencies. For the
first time, evaluations on real-world HVAC deployments show significant
intelligibility, raising novel privacy concerns.

Motivation: 传统音频带宽扩展方法未能充分利用语音固有的非线性混沌物理特性，本文旨在通过显式建模语音的确定性混沌来改进音频带宽扩展性能。

Method: 设计了两种判别器：基于递归表示的多尺度递归判别器(MSRD)捕捉自相似动态，基于李雅普诺夫指数的多分辨率李雅普诺夫判别器(MRLD)捕捉非线性波动和初始条件敏感性。使用深度可分离卷积优化设计。

Conclusion: 首次证明可以通过语音产生的微妙非线性混沌物理特性来监督音频带宽扩展，实现判别器尺寸的显著减小。

Abstract: In this paper, we design two nonlinear dynamical systems-inspired
discriminators -- the Multi-Scale Recurrence Discriminator (MSRD) and the
Multi-Resolution Lyapunov Discriminator (MRLD) -- to \textit{explicitly} model
the inherent deterministic chaos of speech. MSRD is designed based on
Recurrence representations to capture self-similarity dynamics. MRLD is
designed based on Lyapunov exponents to capture nonlinear fluctuations and
sensitivity to initial conditions. Through extensive design optimization and
the use of depthwise-separable convolutions in the discriminators, our
framework surpasses prior AP-BWE model with a 44x reduction in the
discriminator parameter count \textbf{($\sim$ 22M vs $\sim$ 0.48M)}. To the
best of our knowledge, for the first time, this paper demonstrates how BWE can
be supervised by the subtle non-linear chaotic physics of voiced sound
production to achieve a significant reduction in the discriminator size.

Abstract: Understanding the relationships between objectives in a multiobjective
optimisation problem is important for developing tailored and efficient solving
techniques. In particular, when tackling combinatorial optimisation problems
with many objectives, that arise in real-world logistic scenarios, better
support for the decision maker can be achieved through better understanding of
the often complex fitness landscape. This paper makes a contribution in this
direction by presenting a technique that allows a visualisation and analysis of
the local and global relationships between objectives in optimisation problems
with many objectives. The proposed technique uses four steps: First, the global
pairwise relationships are analysed using the Kendall correlation method; then,
the ranges of the values found on the given Pareto front are estimated and
assessed; next, these ranges are used to plot a map using Gray code, similar to
Karnaugh maps, that has the ability to highlight the trade-offs between
multiple objectives; and finally, local relationships are identified using
scatter plots. Experiments are presented for three combinatorial optimisation
problems: multiobjective multidimensional knapsack problem, multiobjective
nurse scheduling problem, and multiobjective vehicle routing problem with time
windows . Results show that the proposed technique helps in the gaining of
insights into the problem difficulty arising from the relationships between
objectives.

paradigm. Experiments are conducted in PettingZoo environment, where multiple
homogeneous drones or agents must self-organize to cover distinct targets

Abstract: Effective tool use is essential for agentic AI, yet training agents to
utilize tools remains challenging due to manually designed rewards, limited
training data, and poor multi-tool selection, resulting in slow adaptation,
wasted computational resources, and suboptimal performance. We introduce
ToolBrain, a lightweight and user-friendly framework for coaching tool use in
agentic models with flexible reinforcement learning (RL), easing the barriers
for researchers and practitioners to adapt LLM-based agents to specific
domains. It supports a wide range of training strategies, including RL
algorithms such as GRPO and DPO, as well as supervised learning. ToolBrain
enables custom reward callables directly on an agent's execution traces or
simply utilizes an automated LLM-as-a-judge system for reward generation. It is
packed with useful capabilities, including knowledge distillation from large to
small models for efficient development, automatic task generation from tool
descriptions, seamless tool retrieval, efficient fine-tuning pipelines with
QLoRA through Unsloth, and quantized inference via bitsandbytes. We demonstrate
ToolBrain through diverse use cases, such as training a CodeAct agent to
autonomously execute email search tasks, showing fast, targeted improvements
(up to 30.0%) in tool-use skills while keeping the codebase simple and
extensible in Agentic AI. Our framework is publicly available at

Abstract: Designing wise AI policy is a grand challenge for society. To design such
policy, policymakers should place a premium on rigorous evidence and scientific
consensus. While several mechanisms exist for evidence generation, and nascent
mechanisms tackle evidence synthesis, we identify a complete void on consensus
formation. In this position paper, we argue NeurIPS should actively catalyze
scientific consensus on AI policy. Beyond identifying the current deficit in
consensus formation mechanisms, we argue that NeurIPS is the best option due
its strengths and the paucity of compelling alternatives. To make progress, we
recommend initial pilots for NeurIPS by distilling lessons from the IPCC's
leadership to build scientific consensus on climate policy. We dispel
predictable counters that AI researchers disagree too much to achieve consensus
and that policy engagement is not the business of NeurIPS. NeurIPS leads AI on
many fronts, and it should champion scientific consensus to create higher

Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型的普及，法律判决预测系统可能开始利用罪犯图像信息，这可能导致意外后果和恶意使用。需要评估VLM在保释决策中的表现并设计干预措施。

Method: 1. 审计VLM在保释预测任务中的表现；2. 设计干预算法：通过RAG管道引入法律先例；3. 使用创新方案微调VLM。

Result: 发现VLM在多个交叉群体中表现不佳，会错误地高置信度拒绝应获保释者。干预措施显著提升了保释预测性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作为未来在VLM部署到真实世界法律判决预测之前设计更智能的干预措施铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been extensively used for legal judgment
prediction tasks based on case reports and crime history. However, with a surge
in the availability of large vision language models (VLMs), legal judgment
prediction systems can now be made to leverage the images of the criminals in
addition to the textual case reports/crime history. Applications built in this
way could lead to inadvertent consequences and be used with malicious intent.
In this work, we run an audit to investigate the efficiency of standalone VLMs
in the bail decision prediction task. We observe that the performance is poor
across multiple intersectional groups and models \textit{wrongly deny bail to
deserving individuals with very high confidence}. We design different
intervention algorithms by first including legal precedents through a RAG
pipeline and then fine-tuning the VLMs using innovative schemes. We demonstrate
that these interventions substantially improve the performance of bail
prediction. Our work paves the way for the design of smarter interventions on
VLMs in the future, before they can be deployed for real-world legal judgment
prediction.

multi-agent settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
mathematically grounded framework, MAGIC-MASK (Multi-Agent Guided Inter-agent
Collaboration with Mask-Based Explainability for Reinforcement Learning), that
extends perturbation-based explanation to Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning.
Our method integrates Proximal Policy Optimization, adaptive epsilon-greedy
exploration, and lightweight inter-agent collaboration to share masked state
information and peer experience. This collaboration enables each agent to
perform saliency-guided masking and share reward-based insights with peers,
reducing the time required for critical state discovery, improving explanation
fidelity, and leading to faster and more robust learning. The core novelty of
our approach lies in generalizing explainability from single-agent to
multi-agent systems through a unified mathematical formalism built on
trajectory perturbation, reward fidelity analysis, and Kullback-Leibler
divergence regularization. This framework yields localized, interpretable
explanations grounded in probabilistic modeling and multi-agent Markov decision
processes. We validate our framework on both single-agent and multi-agent
benchmarks, including a multi-agent highway driving environment and Google
Research Football, demonstrating that MAGIC-MASK consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in fidelity, learning efficiency, and policy
robustness while offering interpretable and transferable explanations.

Abstract: Financial fraud detection in real-world scenarios presents significant
challenges due to the subtlety and dispersion of evidence across complex,
multi-year financial disclosures. In this work, we introduce a novel
multi-agent reasoning framework AuditAgent, enhanced with auditing domain
expertise, for fine-grained evidence chain localization in financial fraud
cases. Leveraging an expert-annotated dataset constructed from enforcement
documents and financial reports released by the China Securities Regulatory
Commission, our approach integrates subject-level risk priors, a hybrid
retrieval strategy, and specialized agent modules to efficiently identify and
aggregate cross-report evidence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method substantially outperforms General-Purpose Agent paradigm in both recall
and interpretability, establishing a new benchmark for automated, transparent
financial forensics. Our results highlight the value of domain-specific
reasoning and dataset construction for advancing robust financial fraud
detection in practical, real-world regulatory applications.

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用具身AI和大视觉语言模型为自主无人机提供实时情境感知和决策能力，以应对突发事件的适应性恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖安全工程师手动编写大量恢复规则，无法预见现实世界中的各种意外情况，且快速变得不完整。需要一种能实时评估情境并生成适当行动的自适应决策方法。

Method: 利用具身AI和大视觉语言模型，在Unreal Engine模拟的城市场景中，让无人机动态解读周围环境并决定紧急机动以实现安全着陆。

Result: 结果表明，具身AI使得一类以前无法手动设计的自适应恢复和决策流程成为可能。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了自主空中系统的韧性和安全性，为无人机应对突发事件提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous drones must often respond to sudden events, such as alarms,
faults, or unexpected changes in their environment, that require immediate and
adaptive decision-making. Traditional approaches rely on safety engineers
hand-coding large sets of recovery rules, but this strategy cannot anticipate
the vast range of real-world contingencies and quickly becomes incomplete.
Recent advances in embodied AI, powered by large visual language models,
provide commonsense reasoning to assess context and generate appropriate
actions in real time. We demonstrate this capability in a simulated urban
benchmark in the Unreal Engine, where drones dynamically interpret their
surroundings and decide on sudden maneuvers for safe landings. Our results show
that embodied AI makes possible a new class of adaptive recovery and
decision-making pipelines that were previously infeasible to design by hand,
advancing resilience and safety in autonomous aerial systems.

*Anni Li,Aria Attar,Paul Dong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Thinkquel是一个经过微调的模型，用于生成可靠、可移植且执行验证的数据库查询。它通过TS-SQL合成数据管道和TS-GRPO强化学习目标，解决了自然语言到SQL转换中的模式链接和SQL方言问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将自然语言请求转换为可靠的生产级数据转换具有挑战性：正确性依赖于精确的模式链接和特定数据仓库的SQL方言，而训练期间最强的监督（执行成功和结果匹配）仅在序列级别提供。

Method: Thinkquel集成了新颖的合成数据管道TS-SQL，利用dbt作为可移植的中间表示，以及Token-Sequence GRPO（TS-GRPO）强化学习目标，专门设计用于在微调LLMs时弥合令牌级训练信号和序列级执行奖励之间的差距。

Result: 在500个示例的TS-SQL测试集上，Thinkquel（32B）达到了93.2%的执行成功率和61.8%的精确结果匹配率，通过两阶段SFT课程学习，相比基础模型分别提高了67.2%（执行）和44.4%（匹配）。在Spider（14B）实验中，TS-GRPO相对于GRPO和GSPO提高了训练稳定性并加速了执行匹配奖励的收敛。

Conclusion: Thinkquel通过创新的合成数据生成和强化学习方法，显著提高了自然语言到SQL转换的准确性和可靠性，为解决该领域的核心挑战提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Transforming natural-language requests into reliable, production-ready data
transformations remains challenging: correctness depends on precise schema
linking and warehouse-specific SQL dialects, while the strongest supervision
available during training--execution success and result matching--are provided
only at the sequence level. At the same time, assembling large,
execution-validated corpora is costly, and token-level objectives misalign with
these global signals, yielding unstable optimization and limited portability.
We introduce Thinkquel, a fine-tuned model for producing robust, portable, and
execution-validated database queries. Methodologies in Thinkquel integrates a
novel synthetic data pipeline, TS-SQL, that leverages dbt as a portable
intermediate representation with a span-aware reinforcement learning objective,
and Token-Sequence GRPO (TS-GRPO), specifically designed to bridge the gap
between token-level training signals and sequence-level execution rewards when
finetuning LLMs. On the 500-example TS-SQL test set, Thinkquel (32B) reaches
93.2\% execution success and 61.8\% exact-result match with a two-stage SFT
curriculum, improving over the base model by 67.2\% (exec.) and 44.4\% (match).
In Spider (14B) experiments, TS-GRPO increases training stability and speeds
convergence of the execution-match reward relative to GRPO and GSPO.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种解耦微调方法，将工具调用任务分解为工具选择和参数生成两个子任务，使用LoRA适配器分别优化，并通过DualTune推理框架实现高效的本地模型代理编排。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型作为代理编排器在任务自动化中表现优异，但需要隐私保护、成本效益高的本地推理解决方案。然而，本地LLM在工具调用场景中表现不如前沿模型，难以处理大型工具集的选择和复杂参数结构的准确生成。

Method: 采用解耦微调方法，使用LoRA微调创建专门的工具选择适配器和工具特定参数生成适配器，通过分离的损失掩码分别优化两个子任务。DualTune推理框架将工具调用生成分解为工具选择和参数生成，动态加载相应LoRA适配器，并实现分层编排以限制工具选择所需工具数量。

Result: 在MCP-Bench基准测试中，使用解耦微调训练的Qwen-2.5-7B模型将基础模型的工具调用准确率提高了46%，在所有情况下都优于相似大小的其他本地推理、非推理和微调模型，在大多数情况下也优于2倍大小的模型。

Conclusion: 解耦微调和DualTune框架显著提升了本地LLM在工具调用任务中的性能，为隐私保护、成本效益高的本地代理编排提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) as agentic orchestrators has
revolutionized task automation, but the need for privacy-preserving,
cost-effective solutions demands on-device inference capabilities. However,
local LLMs consistently underperform compared to frontier models in tool
calling scenarios, struggling with both tool selection from large tool sets and
accurate argument generation for complex parameter structures. We introduce a
methodology that disaggregates a tool-calling task into two distinct subtasks:
tool selection and argument generation. We propose "decoupled fine-tuning", a
novel post-training approach that employs LoRA fine-tuning to create dedicated
LoRA adapters for tool selection and tool-specific argument generation using
separate loss masking for each of the subtasks. Furthermore, we present
DualTune, an inference framework that leverages the LoRA adapters created using
decoupled fine-tuning to perform efficient agent orchestration with the help of
local models on end-user devices. DualTune decomposes the tool-call generation
step into tool selection and argument generation, and dynamically loads the
corresponding LoRA adapters to generate tool calls. Additionally, DualTune
implements hierarchical orchestration to restrict the number of tools required
for tool selection. Our experiments on the MCP-Bench benchmark demonstrate that
the Qwen-2.5-7B model trained using decoupled fine-tuning improves the tool
calling accuracy of the base model by 46%, and outperforms other local
reasoning, non-reasoning and fine-tuned models of similar size in all cases,
and models that are 2x larger, in most cases.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM的智能体框架，用于供应链风险分析，通过将供应链网络视为知识图谱，利用网络中心性评分指导图谱遍历，结合数值因子表和新闻流数据，生成可解释的风险叙述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法过度简化关系，而专业模型成本高且静态，无法有效处理金融风险中复杂的多模态和网络原生数据。

Method: 将供应链网络建模为知识图谱，使用网络中心性评分指导图谱遍历器提取关键风险路径，结合数值因子表和新闻流数据，通过"上下文外壳"模板将原始数据转换为LLM可理解的自然语言。

Result: 该轻量级方法能够实时生成简洁、可解释且上下文丰富的风险叙述，无需昂贵的微调或专用图数据库。

Conclusion: 通过利用网络与知识图谱之间的内在对偶性，该框架有效解决了LLM在复杂金融风险分析中的局限性，提供了一种成本效益高的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with the complex, multi-modal, and
network-native data underlying financial risk. Standard Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) oversimplifies relationships, while specialist models are
costly and static. We address this gap with an LLM-centric agent framework for
supply chain risk analysis. Our core contribution is to exploit the inherent
duality between networks and knowledge graphs (KG). We treat the supply chain
network as a KG, allowing us to use structural network science principles for
retrieval. A graph traverser, guided by network centrality scores, efficiently
extracts the most economically salient risk paths. An agentic architecture
orchestrates this graph retrieval alongside data from numerical factor tables
and news streams. Crucially, it employs novel ``context shells'' -- descriptive
templates that embed raw figures in natural language -- to make quantitative
data fully intelligible to the LLM. This lightweight approach enables the model
to generate concise, explainable, and context-rich risk narratives in real-time
without costly fine-tuning or a dedicated graph database.

TL;DR: ICL引导虽然能提升特定任务性能，但会导致跨领域推理能力下降，出现'优化脆弱性'现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索ICL引导对跨领域认知能力的影响，特别是推理能力在不同知识领域的变化。

Method: 使用GPT-OSS:20b模型的6个变体（1个基线+5种ICL配置），在840个测试中评估通用知识、逻辑谜题和数学奥赛题的推理能力。

Result: ICL模型在通用知识任务上达到91%-99%准确率，但在复杂推理问题上表现下降（谜题准确率降至10-43%，基线为43%），数学奥赛题无显著差异。

Conclusion: ICL引导在效率和推理灵活性之间产生系统性权衡，对LLM部署和AI安全有重要影响。

Abstract: ICL guides are known to improve task-specific performance, but their impact
on cross-domain cognitive abilities remains unexplored. This study examines how
ICL guides affect reasoning across different knowledge domains using six
variants of the GPT-OSS:20b model: one baseline model and five ICL
configurations (simple, chain-of-thought, random, appended text, and symbolic
language). The models were subjected to 840 tests spanning general knowledge
questions, logic riddles, and a mathematical olympiad problem. Statistical
analysis (ANOVA) revealed significant behavioral modifications (p less than
0.001) across ICL variants, demonstrating a phenomenon termed "optimized
fragility." ICL models achieved 91%-99% accuracy on general knowledge tasks
while showing degraded performance on complex reasoning problems, with accuracy
dropping to 10-43% on riddles compared to 43% for the baseline model. Notably,
no significant differences emerged on the olympiad problem (p=0.2173),
suggesting that complex mathematical reasoning remains unaffected by ICL
optimization. These findings indicate that ICL guides create systematic
trade-offs between efficiency and reasoning flexibility, with important
implications for LLM deployment and AI safety.

TL;DR: 本文研究了LLM代理在工具选择中的偏见问题，提出了评估工具选择偏见的基准，发现模型存在对特定提供商的固定偏好或对列表中较早工具的偏好，并提出了轻量级缓解方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理依赖外部工具市场，如果工具选择存在系统性偏见，会降低用户体验并扭曲市场竞争，使某些提供商获得不公平优势。

Method: 创建包含多个功能等效工具的多样化工具类别基准，测试七个模型，进行控制实验分析工具特征、元数据和预训练暴露的影响，提出基于相关子集过滤和均匀采样的缓解方法。

Result: 发现不公平偏见确实存在，语义对齐是最强的选择预测因素，扰动描述会显著改变选择，重复预训练暴露会放大偏见。提出的缓解方法能减少偏见同时保持良好任务覆盖。

Conclusion: 工具选择偏见是工具增强型LLM公平部署的关键障碍，需要关注和解决。

Abstract: Agents backed by large language models (LLMs) often rely on external tools
drawn from marketplaces where multiple providers offer functionally equivalent
options. This raises a critical point concerning fairness: if selection is
systematically biased, it can degrade user experience and distort competition
by privileging some providers over others. We introduce a benchmark of diverse
tool categories, each containing multiple functionally equivalent tools, to
evaluate tool-selection bias. Using this benchmark, we test seven models and
show that unfairness exists with models either fixating on a single provider or
disproportionately preferring earlier-listed tools in context. To investigate
the origins of this bias, we conduct controlled experiments examining tool
features, metadata (name, description, parameters), and pre-training exposure.
We find that: (1) semantic alignment between queries and metadata is the
strongest predictor of choice; (2) perturbing descriptions significantly shifts
selections; and (3) repeated pre-training exposure to a single endpoint
amplifies bias. Finally, we propose a lightweight mitigation that first filters
the candidate tools to a relevant subset and then samples uniformly, reducing
bias while preserving good task coverage. Our findings highlight tool-selection
bias as a key obstacle for the fair deployment of tool-augmented LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CAIA基准测试揭示AI模型在对抗性高风险环境中的严重缺陷：即使使用工具增强，前沿模型在需要区分真相与操纵、处理碎片化信息、做出不可逆决策的任务中表现不佳，准确率仅达67.4%，远低于人类80%的基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI评估主要关注受控环境下的任务完成能力，而忽略了真实世界部署中对抗性环境的重要性。在加密货币市场等高风险领域，AI需要具备抵御主动欺骗的能力。

Method: 使用加密货币市场作为测试平台，评估17个模型在178个时间锚定任务上的表现，要求模型区分真相与操纵、导航碎片化信息环境、在对抗压力下做出不可逆财务决策。

Result: 无工具时前沿模型准确率仅28%；工具增强后提升至67.4%，但仍低于人类80%的基准。模型存在系统性工具选择灾难，偏好不可靠的网页搜索而非权威数据源。

Conclusion: 当前模型尽管在推理得分上表现优异，但在需要抵御主动对抗的环境中仍存在根本性不足，对抗性鲁棒性是可信AI自主性的必要条件。

Abstract: We present CAIA, a benchmark exposing a critical blind spot in AI evaluation:
the inability of state-of-the-art models to operate in adversarial, high-stakes
environments where misinformation is weaponized and errors are irreversible.
While existing benchmarks measure task completion in controlled settings,
real-world deployment demands resilience against active deception. Using crypto
markets as a testbed where $30 billion was lost to exploits in 2024, we
evaluate 17 models on 178 time-anchored tasks requiring agents to distinguish
truth from manipulation, navigate fragmented information landscapes, and make
irreversible financial decisions under adversarial pressure.
  Our results reveal a fundamental capability gap: without tools, even frontier
models achieve only 28% accuracy on tasks junior analysts routinely handle.
Tool augmentation improves performance but plateaus at 67.4% versus 80% human
baseline, despite unlimited access to professional resources. Most critically,
we uncover a systematic tool selection catastrophe: models preferentially
choose unreliable web search over authoritative data, falling for SEO-optimized
misinformation and social media manipulation. This behavior persists even when
correct answers are directly accessible through specialized tools, suggesting
foundational limitations rather than knowledge gaps. We also find that Pass@k
metrics mask dangerous trial-and-error behavior for autonomous deployment.
  The implications extend beyond crypto to any domain with active adversaries,
e.g. cybersecurity, content moderation, etc. We release CAIA with contamination
controls and continuous updates, establishing adversarial robustness as a
necessary condition for trustworthy AI autonomy. The benchmark reveals that
current models, despite impressive reasoning scores, remain fundamentally
unprepared for environments where intelligence must survive active opposition.

Method: 对Hierarchical Reasoning Model类模型进行批判性回顾，检查关键设计选择，并提出有趣的变体

Result: 在Sudoku-Extreme和Maze-Hard任务上取得了比之前报道更好的性能

Conclusion: 研究结果提出了令人惊讶的观察和有趣的研究方向

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable performance in natural language
processing and related domains, as they largely focus on sequential,
autoregressive next-token prediction tasks. Yet, they struggle in logical
reasoning, not necessarily because of a fundamental limitation of these models,
but possibly due to the lack of exploration of more creative uses, such as
latent space and recurrent reasoning. An emerging exploration in this direction
is the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (Wang et al., 2025), which introduces a
novel type of recurrent reasoning in the latent space of transformers,
achieving remarkable performance on a wide range of 2D reasoning tasks. Despite
the promising results, this line of models is still at an early stage and calls
for in-depth investigation. In this work, we perform a critical review on this
class of models, examine key design choices and present intriguing variants
that achieve significantly better performance on the Sudoku-Extreme and
Maze-Hard tasks than previously reported. Our results also raise surprising
observations and intriguing directions for further research.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of intelligent services, communication targets are
shifting from humans to artificial intelligent (AI) agents, which require new
paradigms to enable real-time perception, decision-making, and collaboration.
Semantic communication, which conveys task-relevant meaning rather than raw
data, offers a promising solution. However, its practical deployment remains
constrained by dynamic environments and limited resources. To address these
issues, this article proposes a semantic-driven AI agent communication
framework and develops three enabling techniques. First, semantic adaptation
transmission applies fine-tuning with real or generative samples to efficiently
adapt models to varying environments. Second, semantic lightweight transmission
incorporates pruning, quantization, and perception-aware sampling to reduce
model complexity and alleviate computational burden on edge agents. Third,
semantic self-evolution control employs distributed hierarchical
decision-making to optimize multi-dimensional resources, enabling robust
multi-agent collaboration in dynamic environments. Simulation results show that
the proposed solutions achieve faster convergence and stronger robustness,
while the proposed distributed hierarchical optimization method significantly
outperforms conventional decision-making schemes, highlighting its potential
for AI agent communication networks.

Motivation: 现有智能体基准测试显示出新开发智能体快速达到性能上限的趋势，难以满足评估智能体能力的需求。

Method: TRACE框架包含三个阶段：演化提案挖掘、问题形成与自由探索、多级验证。智能体通过探索将原始任务演化为更高难度的新任务，并记录可验证的执行轨迹。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and agent system designs have
empowered agents with unprecedented levels of capability. However, existing
agent benchmarks are showing a trend of rapid ceiling-hitting by newly
developed agents, making it difficult to meet the demands for evaluating agent
abilities. To address this problem, we propose the Trajectory-based
Validated-by-Reproducing Agent-benchmark Complexity Evolution (TRACE)
framework. This framework takes an original task from an existing benchmark and
encourages agents to freely explore and evolve it into a new task with higher
difficulty while recording validatable agent trajectories. The framework
proceeds in three stages: (1) evolutionary proposal mining, which provides task
evolution proposals through preliminary exploration and divergent thinking; (2)
problem formation and free exploration, where proposals are conceptualized into
feasible problem candidates and the agents then explore them freely while
recording their execution trajectories; and (3) multi-level validation, which
ensures that the evolved tasks are accompanied by validatable and reproducible
trajectories. Experiments on the GAIA benchmark demonstrate that the TRACE
framework consistently enhances task complexity while improving the reliability
of correctness through validatable execution trajectories. This work marks a
paradigm shift from static, manually curated benchmarks to dynamic,
self-evolving evaluation systems, providing a sustainable and challenging
runway for agent development.

Motivation: 当前评估AI回答患者健康问题的黄金标准是人工专家评审，但这种方法劳动密集且速度慢，限制了可扩展性。需要寻找可靠的自动化评估方法。

Method: 收集了100个患者住院相关问题，从28个AI系统获取2800个回答，从三个维度评估：是否回答问题、是否恰当使用临床记录证据、是否使用通用医学知识，并使用临床医生撰写的参考答案作为评估基准。

Result: 自动化排名与专家评分高度匹配，表明精心设计的自动化评估能够有效替代人工评审。

Conclusion: 精心设计的自动化评估可以扩展AI系统的比较评估，支持患者-临床医生沟通。

Abstract: Automated approaches to answer patient-posed health questions are rising, but
selecting among systems requires reliable evaluation. The current gold standard
for evaluating the free-text artificial intelligence (AI) responses--human
expert review--is labor-intensive and slow, limiting scalability. Automated
metrics are promising yet variably aligned with human judgments and often
context-dependent. To address the feasibility of automating the evaluation of
AI responses to hospitalization-related questions posed by patients, we
conducted a large systematic study of evaluation approaches. Across 100 patient
cases, we collected responses from 28 AI systems (2800 total) and assessed them
along three dimensions: whether a system response (1) answers the question, (2)
appropriately uses clinical note evidence, and (3) uses general medical
knowledge. Using clinician-authored reference answers to anchor metrics,
automated rankings closely matched expert ratings. Our findings suggest that
carefully designed automated evaluation can scale comparative assessment of AI
systems and support patient-clinician communication.

Motivation: 传统基于规则的分析方法直观但有限，现代机器学习模型往往进行模式匹配而缺乏明确的智能体表示。需要构建既能从数据中学习，又具有战术可解释性且能在异构数据源间保持鲁棒性的球员级智能体模型。

Method: 提出EDMS方法：1）语义增强的状态表示，在原始位置和速度基础上增加关系变量（如空间得分、传球和得分）；2）动作掩码方案，为持球和无球球员提供不同的决策集；3）将学习到的价值函数和动作策略映射到人类可解释的战术概念。

Result: 实验表明，EDMS与动作掩码相比基线方法持续降低了动作预测损失和时序差分误差。定性案例研究和Q值可视化显示EDMS能突出高风险高回报的战术模式（如快速反击和防守突破）。

Conclusion: EDMS方法能够构建战术可解释的球员级智能体模型，与多个商业和开源数据集兼容，支持跨供应商评估和可重复实验，为团队运动的定量战术分析提供了新途径。

Abstract: Invasion team sports such as soccer produce a high-dimensional, strongly
coupled state space as many players continuously interact on a shared field,
challenging quantitative tactical analysis. Traditional rule-based analyses are
intuitive, while modern predictive machine learning models often perform
pattern-matching without explicit agent representations. The problem we address
is how to build player-level agent models from data, whose learned values and
policies are both tactically interpretable and robust across heterogeneous data
sources. Here, we propose Expandable Decision-Making States (EDMS), a
semantically enriched state representation that augments raw positions and
velocities with relational variables (e.g., scoring of space, pass, and score),
combined with an action-masking scheme that gives on-ball and off-ball agents
distinct decision sets. Compared to prior work, EDMS maps learned value
functions and action policies to human-interpretable tactical concepts (e.g.,
marking pressure, passing lanes, ball accessibility) instead of raw coordinate
features, and aligns agent choices with the rules of play. In the experiments,
EDMS with action masking consistently reduced both action-prediction loss and
temporal-difference (TD) error compared to the baseline. Qualitative case
studies and Q-value visualizations further indicate that EDMS highlights
high-risk, high-reward tactical patterns (e.g., fast counterattacks and
defensive breakthroughs). We also integrated our approach into an open-source
library and demonstrated compatibility with multiple commercial and open
datasets, enabling cross-provider evaluation and reproducible experiments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究开发了针对RAG系统的数据质量维度，通过访谈实践者识别出15个维度分布在四个处理阶段，发现需要在传统框架基础上增加新维度，并建议采用前置质量管理策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数据质量框架主要针对静态数据集，无法充分应对RAG系统的动态多阶段特性，需要开发专门的数据质量维度来支持这种新型AI系统。

Method: 对16家领先IT服务公司的从业者进行半结构化访谈，通过定性内容分析归纳得出RAG系统的数据质量维度。

Result: 识别出15个不同的数据质量维度，分布在数据提取、数据转换、提示与搜索、生成四个处理阶段。发现新维度主要集中在早期阶段，数据质量问题会在RAG管道中转化和传播。

Conclusion: 需要在传统数据质量框架基础上增加新维度来覆盖RAG上下文，建议采用前置质量管理策略和动态、阶段感知的质量管理方法。

Abstract: Organizations increasingly adopt Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to
enhance Large Language Models with enterprise-specific knowledge. However,
current data quality (DQ) frameworks have been primarily developed for static
datasets, and only inadequately address the dynamic, multi-stage nature of RAG
systems. This study aims to develop DQ dimensions for this new type of AI-based
systems. We conduct 16 semi-structured interviews with practitioners of leading
IT service companies. Through a qualitative content analysis, we inductively
derive 15 distinct DQ dimensions across the four processing stages of RAG
systems: data extraction, data transformation, prompt & search, and generation.
Our findings reveal that (1) new dimensions have to be added to traditional DQ
frameworks to also cover RAG contexts; (2) these new dimensions are
concentrated in early RAG steps, suggesting the need for front-loaded quality
management strategies, and (3) DQ issues transform and propagate through the
RAG pipeline, necessitating a dynamic, step-aware approach to quality
management.

TL;DR: 本研究挑战了传统观点，发现在14个多样化领域中，生成式结果奖励模型(GenORM)表现最稳健，而非传统认为的过程奖励模型(PRM)更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为过程奖励模型(PRM)优于结果奖励模型(ORM)，但这种观点主要基于数学相关领域的证据。本研究旨在在多样化领域中对四种奖励模型变体进行统一评估。

Method: 在14个多样化领域中评估四种奖励模型变体：判别式ORM和PRM(DisORM, DisPRM)以及生成式ORM和PRM(GenORM, GenPRM)。

Result: 研究发现：(i) DisORM与DisPRM表现相当；(ii) GenPRM不具竞争力；(iii) GenORM是最稳健的模型，在所有测试领域中都取得了显著且一致的增益。

Conclusion: 这些发现挑战了细粒度监督总是更好的普遍假设，支持在多领域部署中使用生成式结果验证。

Abstract: The reliability of large language models (LLMs) during test-time scaling is
often assessed with \emph{external verifiers} or \emph{reward models} that
distinguish correct reasoning from flawed logic. Prior work generally assumes
that process reward models (PRMs), which score every intermediate reasoning
step, outperform outcome reward models (ORMs) that assess only the final
answer. This view is based mainly on evidence from narrow, math-adjacent
domains. We present the first unified evaluation of four reward model variants,
discriminative ORM and PRM (\DisORM, \DisPRM) and generative ORM and PRM
(\GenORM, \GenPRM), across 14 diverse domains. Contrary to conventional wisdom,
we find that (i) \DisORM performs on par with \DisPRM, (ii) \GenPRM is not
competitive, and (iii) overall, \GenORM is the most robust, yielding
significant and consistent gains across every tested domain. We attribute this
to PRM-style stepwise scoring, which inherits label noise from LLM
auto-labeling and has difficulty evaluating long reasoning trajectories,
including those involving self-correcting reasoning. Our theoretical analysis
shows that step-wise aggregation compounds errors as reasoning length grows,
and our empirical observations confirm this effect. These findings challenge
the prevailing assumption that fine-grained supervision is always better and
support generative outcome verification for multi-domain deployment. We
publicly release our code, datasets, and checkpoints at
\href{https://github.com/db-Lee/Multi-RM}{\underline{\small\texttt{https://github.com/db-Lee/Multi-RM}}}
to facilitate future research in multi-domain settings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VIRTUE是一个视觉交互式文本图像通用嵌入器，通过整合分割模型和视觉语言模型，支持用户通过视觉提示（点、边界框、掩码）指定感兴趣区域，从而在表示学习中实现更精确的实体级信息处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有嵌入模型缺乏视觉交互能力，无法让用户指定感兴趣区域，而生成模型已探索了这种能力。为嵌入模型添加视觉交互不仅能解锁基于用户意图定位的新应用，还能让模型学习图像中的实体级信息以补充全局表示。

Method: 将分割模型和视觉语言模型的能力扩展到表示学习领域。分割模型处理视觉提示以定位图像中的特定区域，使嵌入器能更精确地处理复杂和模糊场景。

Result: 在36个通用MMEB任务上性能提升3.1%-8.5%，在5个视觉交互SCaR任务上提升15.2%-20.3%，均达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: VIRTUE成功将视觉交互能力引入嵌入模型，通过结合分割和视觉语言模型，在表示学习中实现了更精确的实体级信息处理，显著提升了多种任务的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning models have demonstrated successful
operation across complex tasks, and the integration of vision-language models
(VLMs) has further enabled embedding models with instruction-following
capabilities. However, existing embedding models lack visual-interactive
capabilities to specify regions of interest from users (e.g., point, bounding
box, mask), which have been explored in generative models to broaden their
human-interactive applicability. Equipping embedding models with visual
interactions not only would unlock new applications with localized grounding of
user intent, which remains unexplored, but also enable the models to learn
entity-level information within images to complement their global
representations for conventional embedding tasks. In this paper, we propose a
novel Visual-InteRactive Text-Image Universal Embedder (VIRTUE) that extends
the capabilities of the segmentation model and the vision-language model to the
realm of representation learning. In VIRTUE, the segmentation model can process
visual prompts that pinpoint specific regions within an image, thereby enabling
the embedder to handle complex and ambiguous scenarios more precisely. To
evaluate the visual-interaction ability of VIRTUE, we introduce a large-scale
Segmentation-and-Scene Caption Retrieval (SCaR) benchmark comprising 1M samples
that aims to retrieve the text caption by jointly considering the entity with a
specific object and image scene. VIRTUE consistently achieves a
state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements across 36 universal
MMEB (3.1%-8.5%) and five visual-interactive SCaR (15.2%-20.3%) tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型通过迭代去噪并行生成令牌，但其推理机制带来的安全风险尚未被充分理解，特别是针对越狱攻击的脆弱性。

Method: 提出一种针对DLM的安全对齐方法，训练模型从包含肯定令牌的污染中间状态生成安全响应。

Result: 实验表明该方法显著缓解了漏洞，对任务性能影响最小，并提高了对传统越狱攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了DLM特定安全研究的必要性，提出的方法有效提升了扩散语言模型的安全性。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) generate tokens in parallel through
iterative denoising, which can reduce latency and enable bidirectional
conditioning. However, the safety risks posed by jailbreak attacks that exploit
this inference mechanism are not well understood. In this paper, we reveal that
DLMs have a critical vulnerability stemming from their iterative denoising
process and propose a countermeasure. Specifically, our investigation shows
that if an affirmative token for a harmful query appears at an intermediate
step, subsequent denoising can be steered toward a harmful response even in
aligned models. As a result, simply injecting such affirmative tokens can
readily bypass the safety guardrails. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the
vulnerability allows existing optimization-based jailbreak attacks to succeed
on DLMs. Building on this analysis, we propose a novel safety alignment method
tailored to DLMs that trains models to generate safe responses from
contaminated intermediate states that contain affirmative tokens. Our
experiments indicate that the proposed method significantly mitigates the
vulnerability with minimal impact on task performance. Furthermore, our method
improves robustness against conventional jailbreak attacks. Our work
underscores the need for DLM-specific safety research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Agent Context Optimization (ACON)框架，通过优化压缩指南来压缩环境观察和交互历史，减少内存使用26-54%同时保持任务性能，并可蒸馏到更小的压缩器中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为智能体在动态环境中部署时，需要积累长历史记录，导致上下文长度增长，增加成本并降低长视野任务的效率。现有上下文压缩方法主要关注单步任务或狭窄应用。

Method: ACON框架在自然语言空间中优化压缩指南：当完整上下文成功但压缩上下文失败时，LLM分析失败原因并相应更新压缩指南。还将优化的LLM压缩器蒸馏到更小的模型中。

Result: 在AppWorld、OfficeBench和Multi-objective QA上的实验显示，ACON减少内存使用26-54%（峰值token），同时基本保持任务性能，蒸馏到更小压缩器时保持95%以上准确率，并提升较小LM作为长视野智能体的性能达46%。

Conclusion: ACON提供了一种有效的上下文压缩方法，可显著减少内存使用同时保持性能，并能通过蒸馏技术扩展到更小的模型中。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in dynamic,
real-world environments, where success requires both reasoning and effective
tool use. A central challenge for agentic tasks is the growing context length,
as agents must accumulate long histories of actions and observations. This
expansion raises costs and reduces efficiency in long-horizon tasks, yet prior
work on context compression has mostly focused on single-step tasks or narrow
applications. We introduce Agent Context Optimization (ACON), a unified
framework that optimally compresses both environment observations and
interaction histories into concise yet informative condensations. ACON
leverages compression guideline optimization in natural language space: given
paired trajectories where full context succeeds but compressed context fails,
capable LLMs analyze the causes of failure, and the compression guideline is
updated accordingly. Furthermore, we propose distilling the optimized LLM
compressor into smaller models to reduce the overhead of the additional module.
Experiments on AppWorld, OfficeBench, and Multi-objective QA show that ACON
reduces memory usage by 26-54% (peak tokens) while largely preserving task
performance, preserves over 95% of accuracy when distilled into smaller
compressors, and enhances smaller LMs as long-horizon agents with up to 46%
performance improvement.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HARPA是一个用于自动化科学发现的AI系统，通过文献挖掘识别研究趋势，探索假设设计空间，并生成可测试的、基于文献的假设。相比基线AI研究者，HARPA在可行性和基础性方面表现更优，并能通过奖励模型从实验经验中学习改进假设生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动化科学发现工具难以生成既可测试又基于科学文献的假设，且无法根据先前的实验结果进行自适应调整。

Method: HARPA采用受人类研究者启发的构思流程：首先通过文献挖掘识别新兴研究趋势，然后探索假设设计空间，最后通过定位研究空白和论证设计选择来收敛到精确、可测试的假设。系统还学习奖励模型，基于先前的实验结果对新假设进行评分。

Result: HARPA生成的研究提案在可行性(+0.78)和基础性(+0.85)方面显著优于基线AI研究者。与ASD代理(CodeScientist)测试时，HARPA产生更多成功执行(20 vs 11/40)和更少失败(16 vs 21/40)。奖励模型相比未训练基线评分器实现了约28%的绝对增益。

Conclusion: HARPA的方法在AI驱动的科学发现领域向前迈进了一步，能够生成更可行、更基于文献的假设，并能从实验经验中学习改进假设生成过程。

Abstract: While there has been a surge of interest in automated scientific discovery
(ASD), especially with the emergence of LLMs, it remains challenging for tools
to generate hypotheses that are both testable and grounded in the scientific
literature. Additionally, existing ideation tools are not adaptive to prior
experimental outcomes. We developed HARPA to address these challenges by
incorporating the ideation workflow inspired by human researchers. HARPA first
identifies emerging research trends through literature mining, then explores
hypothesis design spaces, and finally converges on precise, testable hypotheses
by pinpointing research gaps and justifying design choices. Our evaluations
show that HARPA-generated hypothesis-driven research proposals perform
comparably to a strong baseline AI-researcher across most qualitative
dimensions (e.g., specificity, novelty, overall quality), but achieve
significant gains in feasibility(+0.78, p$<0.05$, bootstrap) and groundedness
(+0.85, p$<0.01$, bootstrap) on a 10-point Likert scale. When tested with the
ASD agent (CodeScientist), HARPA produced more successful executions (20 vs. 11
out of 40) and fewer failures (16 vs. 21 out of 40), showing that expert
feasibility judgments track with actual execution success. Furthermore, to
simulate how researchers continuously refine their understanding of what
hypotheses are both testable and potentially interesting from experience, HARPA
learns a reward model that scores new hypotheses based on prior experimental
outcomes, achieving approx. a 28\% absolute gain over HARPA's untrained
baseline scorer. Together, these methods represent a step forward in the field
of AI-driven scientific discovery.

TL;DR: 该论文揭示了当前模型编辑方法存在严重缺陷，看似成功的编辑实际上基于脆弱的捷径而非真实语义，在否定查询下会崩溃。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型不可避免地编码过时或错误知识，模型编辑被认为是有前景的解决方案，但作者发现现有方法存在根本性问题。

Method: 开发了一套新的评估方法，特别设计了否定查询等负例来测试模型编辑的鲁棒性。

Result: 发现最先进的模型编辑方法在简单的否定查询下就会崩溃，表明编辑可能基于捷径而非完整语义。

Conclusion: 模型编辑领域的基础存在严重问题，需要在进一步推进前重新审视其基本前提。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) inevitably encode outdated or incorrect
knowledge. Updating, deleting, and forgetting such knowledge is important for
alignment, safety, and other issues. To address this issue, model editing has
emerged as a promising paradigm: by precisely editing a small subset of
parameters such that a specific fact is updated while preserving other
knowledge. Despite its great success reported in previous papers, we find the
apparent reliability of editing rests on a fragile foundation and the current
literature is largely driven by illusory success. The fundamental goal of
steering the model's output toward a target with minimal modification would
encourage exploiting hidden shortcuts, rather than utilizing real semantics.
This problem directly challenges the feasibility of the current model editing
literature at its very foundation, as shortcuts are inherently at odds with
robust knowledge integration. Coincidentally, this issue has long been obscured
by evaluation frameworks that lack the design of negative examples. To uncover
it, we systematically develop a suite of new evaluation methods. Strikingly, we
find that state-of-the-art approaches collapse even under the simplest negation
queries. Our empirical evidence shows that editing is likely to be based on
shortcuts rather than full semantics, calling for an urgent reconsideration of
the very basis of model editing before further advancements can be meaningfully
pursued.

TL;DR: 提出CDDM方法，通过协作渐进蒸馏技术将高容量教师扩散模型的知识转移到轻量级学生模型，实现实时轻量化的轨迹预测，在保持高精度的同时大幅减少模型参数和采样步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在概率轨迹预测中表现出色，但模型规模大、采样速度慢，阻碍了实际部署。需要开发既能保持预测精度又能满足实时性要求的轻量化方法。

Method: 基于协作渐进蒸馏(CPD)，逐步将教师扩散模型知识转移到学生模型，同时减少采样步骤和模型规模。引入双信号正则化蒸馏损失，结合教师和真实数据指导，防止过拟合。

Result: 在ETH-UCY行人基准和nuScenes车辆基准上达到最先进预测精度。蒸馏后的CDDM仅需231K参数和2-4采样步骤，实现161倍压缩、31倍加速和9ms延迟，保持96.2% ADE和95.5% FDE性能。

Conclusion: CDDM通过桥接高性能生成模型与实用部署约束，为自动驾驶和智能交通系统提供了资源高效的轨迹预测解决方案。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a fundamental task in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), supporting efficient motion planning
and real-time traffic safety management. Diffusion models have recently
demonstrated strong performance in probabilistic trajectory prediction, but
their large model size and slow sampling process hinder real-world deployment.
This paper proposes Collaborative-Distilled Diffusion Models (CDDM), a novel
method for real-time and lightweight trajectory prediction. Built upon
Collaborative Progressive Distillation (CPD), CDDM progressively transfers
knowledge from a high-capacity teacher diffusion model to a lightweight student
model, jointly reducing both the number of sampling steps and the model size
across distillation iterations. A dual-signal regularized distillation loss is
further introduced to incorporate guidance from both the teacher and
ground-truth data, mitigating potential overfitting and ensuring robust
performance. Extensive experiments on the ETH-UCY pedestrian benchmark and the
nuScenes vehicle benchmark demonstrate that CDDM achieves state-of-the-art
prediction accuracy. The well-distilled CDDM retains 96.2% and 95.5% of the
baseline model's ADE and FDE performance on pedestrian trajectories, while
requiring only 231K parameters and 4 or 2 sampling steps, corresponding to 161x
compression, 31x acceleration, and 9 ms latency. Qualitative results further
show that CDDM generates diverse and accurate trajectories under dynamic agent
behaviors and complex social interactions. By bridging high-performing
generative models with practical deployment constraints, CDDM enables
resource-efficient probabilistic prediction for AVs and ITS. Code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存的内存消耗是LLM推理效率的主要瓶颈，现有基于注意力分数的压缩方法面临未来token注意力分数不可用和现代实现不生成完整注意力矩阵的局限。

Method: 利用LLM激活的分布特性，以闭式形式计算每个KV对的期望注意力分数，基于这些分数进行排序和剪枝，最小化对残差流的影响。

Result: 该方法在预填充和解码阶段都能无缝运行，在两个场景下都持续优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: Expected Attention方法实现了有效的KV缓存压缩且不影响性能，发布的KVPress库为研究人员提供了实现和基准测试KV缓存压缩方法的工具。

Abstract: Memory consumption of the Key-Value (KV) cache represents a major bottleneck
for efficient large language model inference. While attention-score-based KV
cache pruning shows promise, it faces critical practical limitations: attention
scores from future tokens are unavailable during compression, and modern
implementations like Flash Attention do not materialize the full attention
matrix, making past scores inaccessible. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce $\textbf{Expected Attention, a training-free compression method}$
that estimates KV pairs importance by predicting how future queries will attend
to them. Our approach leverages the distributional properties of LLM
activations to compute expected attention scores in closed form for each KV
pair. These scores enable principled ranking and pruning of KV pairs with
minimal impact on the residual stream, achieving effective compression without
performance degradation. Importantly, our method operates seamlessly across
both prefilling and decoding phases, consistently outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines in both scenarios. Finally, $\textbf{we release
KVPress, a comprehensive library to enable researchers to implement and
benchmark KV cache compression methods, already including more than 20
techniques}$.

Abstract: Understanding the inner workings of deep learning models is crucial for
advancing artificial intelligence, particularly in high-stakes fields such as

introduces Batch-CAM, a novel training paradigm that fuses a batch

loss. This combination guides the model to focus on salient image features,
thereby enhancing its performance across classification tasks. Our results
demonstrate that Batch-CAM achieves a simultaneous improvement in accuracy and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 游戏求解中相关区域(RZ)的大小影响策略重用效果和剪枝效率，现有方法产生的RZ大小不一，较小的RZ更有利于提高重用概率和效率。

Method: 设计三种约束生成策略，集成RZ模式表以充分利用历史解，通过迭代求解逐步限制区域范围来缩减RZ大小。

Result: 在7x7 Killall-Go实验中，平均RZ大小缩减至原始的85.95%。

Conclusion: 缩减后的RZ可作为可重用知识永久存储，为更大棋盘或不同开局提供支持。

Abstract: Game solving aims to find the optimal strategies for all players and
determine the theoretical outcome of a game. However, due to the exponential
growth of game trees, many games remain unsolved, even though methods like
AlphaZero have demonstrated super-human level in game playing. The
Relevance-Zone (RZ) is a local strategy reuse technique that restricts the
search to only the regions relevant to the outcome, significantly reducing the
search space. However, RZs are not unique. Different solutions may result in
RZs of varying sizes. Smaller RZs are generally more favorable, as they
increase the chance of reuse and improve pruning efficiency. To this end, we
propose an iterative RZ reduction method that repeatedly solves the same
position while gradually restricting the region involved, guiding the solver
toward smaller RZs. We design three constraint generation strategies and
integrate an RZ Pattern Table to fully leverage past solutions. In experiments
on 7x7 Killall-Go, our method reduces the average RZ size to 85.95% of the
original. Furthermore, the reduced RZs can be permanently stored as reusable
knowledge for future solving tasks, especially for larger board sizes or
different openings.

Conclusion: ACPO通过自适应学习策略有效解决了现有策略优化算法的局限性，为复杂推理任务的视觉语言模型对齐提供了更优的训练框架。

Abstract: Aligning large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) for complex reasoning via
reinforcement learning is often hampered by the limitations of existing policy
optimization algorithms, such as static training schedules and the rigid,
uniform clipping mechanism in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). In this work,
we introduce Adaptive Curriculum Policy Optimization (ACPO), a novel framework
that addresses these challenges through a dual-component adaptive learning
strategy. First, ACPO employs a dynamic curriculum that orchestrates a
principled transition from a stable, near on-policy exploration phase to an
efficient, off-policy exploitation phase by progressively increasing sample
reuse. Second, we propose an Advantage-Aware Adaptive Clipping (AAAC) mechanism
that replaces the fixed clipping hyperparameter with dynamic, sample-wise
bounds modulated by the normalized advantage of each token. This allows for
more granular and robust policy updates, enabling larger gradients for
high-potential samples while safeguarding against destructive ones. We conduct
extensive experiments on a suite of challenging multimodal reasoning
benchmarks, including MathVista, LogicVista, and MMMU-Pro. Results demonstrate
that ACPO consistently outperforms strong baselines such as DAPO and PAPO,
achieving state-of-the-art performance, accelerated convergence, and superior
training stability.

Motivation: 利用社交媒体平台作为观察个体心理状态的窗口，开发可信赖且透明的AI系统进行心理健康评估。

Method: 使用注意力机制层次编码帖子（单字和双字），通过交叉注意力融合心理健康知识图谱的领域知识，采用有序回归框架预测抑郁症严重程度。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，AttentionDep在分级F1分数上比现有最优方法提升超过5%，并提供可解释的预测洞察。

Conclusion: 该工作推动了基于社交媒体的心理健康评估可信赖和透明AI系统的发展。

Abstract: In today's interconnected society, social media platforms provide a window
into individuals' thoughts, emotions, and mental states. This paper explores
the use of platforms like Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Reddit for
depression severity detection. We propose AttentionDep, a domain-aware
attention model that drives explainable depression severity estimation by
fusing contextual and domain knowledge. Posts are encoded hierarchically using
unigrams and bigrams, with attention mechanisms highlighting clinically
relevant tokens. Domain knowledge from a curated mental health knowledge graph
is incorporated through a cross-attention mechanism, enriching the contextual
features. Finally, depression severity is predicted using an ordinal regression
framework that respects the clinical-relevance and natural ordering of severity
levels. Our experiments demonstrate that AttentionDep outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by over 5% in graded F1 score across datasets, while
providing interpretable insights into its predictions. This work advances the
development of trustworthy and transparent AI systems for mental health
assessment from social media.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的数据增强流水线，通过对称性和难度两个角度提升定理证明模型的鲁棒性，并训练出在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平的非推理定理证明器EvolProver。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在形式定理证明中表现出潜力，但缺乏泛化能力，对问题陈述的微小变换也很脆弱。

Method: 从对称性角度提出EvolAST（基于抽象语法树）和EvolDomain（跨数学领域翻译）；从难度角度提出EvolDifficulty（生成不同难度的新定理）。使用增强数据训练7B参数的EvolProver非推理定理证明器。

Result: EvolProver在FormalMATH-Lite上达到53.8% pass@32，在MiniF2F-Test、Ineq-Comp-Seed和Ineq-Comp-Transformed上分别达到69.8%、52.2%和34.0% pass@32，均创下非推理模型的新记录。

Conclusion: 数据增强流水线在多个基准测试中有效提升了定理证明模型的性能，证明了该方法对增强模型鲁棒性的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for formal theorem proving have shown
significant promise, yet they often lack generalizability and are fragile to
even minor transformations of problem statements. To address this limitation,
we introduce a novel data augmentation pipeline designed to enhance model
robustness from two perspectives: symmetry and difficulty. From the symmetry
perspective, we propose two complementary methods: EvolAST, an Abstract Syntax
Tree (AST) based approach that targets syntactic symmetry to generate
semantically equivalent problem variants, and EvolDomain, which leverages LLMs
to address semantic symmetry by translating theorems across mathematical
domains. From the difficulty perspective, we propose EvolDifficulty, which uses
carefully designed evolutionary instructions to guide LLMs in generating new
theorems with a wider range of difficulty. We then use the evolved data to
train EvolProver, a 7B-parameter non-reasoning theorem prover. EvolProver
establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on FormalMATH-Lite with a 53.8%
pass@32 rate, surpassing all models of comparable size, including
reasoning-based models. It also sets new SOTA records for non-reasoning models
on MiniF2F-Test (69.8% pass@32), Ineq-Comp-Seed (52.2% pass@32), and
Ineq-Comp-Transformed (34.0% pass@32). Ablation studies further confirm our
data augmentation pipeline's effectiveness across multiple benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了DDIM反演攻击(DIA)方法，通过攻击DDIM反演轨迹路径来有效破坏恶意图像编辑，在防御性能上超越了现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DDIM反演技术虽然为真实图像编辑提供了便利，但也使恶意用户更容易合成虚假或深度伪造内容，促进了不道德和侵权内容的传播。现有防御方法在破坏扩散过程方面效果有限。

Method: 提出了DDIM反演攻击(DIA)，通过攻击集成的DDIM轨迹路径来破坏扩散模型的编辑能力。

Result: DIA在破坏效果上超越了之前的防御方法，在各种编辑方法上都表现出有效的干扰性能。

Conclusion: 该框架和结果为工业界和研究社区提供了实用的防御方法，能够有效对抗AI的恶意使用。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown to be strong representation learners, showcasing
state-of-the-art performance across multiple domains. Aside from accelerated
sampling, DDIM also enables the inversion of real images back to their latent
codes. A direct inheriting application of this inversion operation is real
image editing, where the inversion yields latent trajectories to be utilized
during the synthesis of the edited image. Unfortunately, this practical tool
has enabled malicious users to freely synthesize misinformative or deepfake
contents with greater ease, which promotes the spread of unethical and abusive,
as well as privacy-, and copyright-infringing contents. While defensive
algorithms such as AdvDM and Photoguard have been shown to disrupt the
diffusion process on these images, the misalignment between their objectives
and the iterative denoising trajectory at test time results in weak disruptive
performance.In this work, we present the DDIM Inversion Attack (DIA) that
attacks the integrated DDIM trajectory path. Our results support the effective
disruption, surpassing previous defensive methods across various editing
methods. We believe that our frameworks and results can provide practical
defense methods against the malicious use of AI for both the industry and the
research community. Our code is available here:

Motivation: 化学信息提取面临数据异质性挑战，现有基于代理的方法在该领域表现有限，需要专门的评估资源。

Method: 创建了10个手动策划的化学数据集，进行广泛的基准测试，比较现有最先进的代理系统，并提出了单代理方法控制文档预处理。

Result: 实证发现化学信息提取存在持续挑战，特别是在处理领域特定术语、复杂表格和图示表示以及上下文相关歧义方面。

Conclusion: ChemX基准为推进化学自动化信息提取提供了关键资源，挑战了现有方法的泛化能力，并为有效评估策略提供了宝贵见解。

Abstract: The emergence of agent-based systems represents a significant advancement in
artificial intelligence, with growing applications in automated data
extraction. However, chemical information extraction remains a formidable
challenge due to the inherent heterogeneity of chemical data. Current
agent-based approaches, both general-purpose and domain-specific, exhibit
limited performance in this domain. To address this gap, we present ChemX, a
comprehensive collection of 10 manually curated and domain-expert-validated
datasets focusing on nanomaterials and small molecules. These datasets are
designed to rigorously evaluate and enhance automated extraction methodologies
in chemistry. To demonstrate their utility, we conduct an extensive
benchmarking study comparing existing state-of-the-art agentic systems such as
ChatGPT Agent and chemical-specific data extraction agents. Additionally, we
introduce our own single-agent approach that enables precise control over
document preprocessing prior to extraction. We further evaluate the performance
of modern baselines, such as GPT-5 and GPT-5 Thinking, to compare their
capabilities with agentic approaches. Our empirical findings reveal persistent
challenges in chemical information extraction, particularly in processing
domain-specific terminology, complex tabular and schematic representations, and
context-dependent ambiguities. The ChemX benchmark serves as a critical
resource for advancing automated information extraction in chemistry,
challenging the generalization capabilities of existing methods, and providing
valuable insights into effective evaluation strategies.

Method: 在语义层面比较加权知识库和c-representations，分析它们如何通过不同的惩罚机制对解释进行排序，并研究推理关系的等价表达

Result: 证明在特定条件下，加权知识库和一组可废止条件可以生成相同的解释排序，实现语义结构的相对成本等价性

Conclusion: 两种形式化方法在某些方面具有等价性，这一发现对成本语义和c-representations的进一步研究具有潜在益处

Abstract: Weighted-knowledge bases and cost-based semantics represent a recent
formalism introduced by Bienvenu et al. for Ontology Mediated Data Querying in
the case where a given knowledge base is inconsistent. This is done by adding a
weight to each statement in the knowledge base (KB), and then giving each DL
interpretation a cost based on how often it breaks rules in the KB. In this
paper we compare this approach with c-representations, a form of non-monotonic
reasoning originally introduced by Kern-Isberner. c-Representations describe a
means to interpret defeasible concept inclusions in the first-order case. This
is done by assigning a numerical ranking to each interpretations via penalties
for each violated conditional. We compare these two approaches on a semantic
level. In particular, we show that under certain conditions a weighted
knowledge base and a set of defeasible conditionals can generate the same
ordering on interpretations, and therefore an equivalence of semantic
structures up to relative cost. Moreover, we compare entailment described in
both cases, where certain notions are equivalently expressible in both
formalisms. Our results have the potential to benefit further work on both
cost-based semantics and c-representations

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索分类器评估中一致性与分歧的不对称性，当专家意见一致时无法排除任何可能的评估结果，而当意见分歧时则可确定至少有一方错误。这种不对称性激发了构建仅基于逻辑一致性的无监督评估方法的需求。

Method: 将分类器对齐决策的统计摘要作为输入，构建整数空间中可能正确或错误响应的线性规划问题。包含明显逻辑约束的不等式和适用于所有有限测试的线性等式公理。

Result: 开发了无需知识的警报系统，能够检测LLM评委是否违反用户设定的最低评分阈值，展示了该方法在实际应用中的即时效用。

Conclusion: 基于逻辑一致性的无监督评估方法具有实际应用价值，能够有效检测分类器评估中的异常情况，为自动化评估系统提供了新的理论框架。

Abstract: If two experts disagree on a test, we may conclude both cannot be 100 per
cent correct. But if they completely agree, no possible evaluation can be
excluded. This asymmetry in the utility of agreements versus disagreements is
explored here by formalizing a logic of unsupervised evaluation for
classifiers. Its core problem is computing the set of group evaluations that
are logically consistent with how we observe them agreeing and disagreeing in
their decisions. Statistical summaries of their aligned decisions are inputs
into a Linear Programming problem in the integer space of possible correct or
incorrect responses given true labels. Obvious logical constraints, such as,
the number of correct responses cannot exceed the number of observed responses,
are inequalities. But in addition, there are axioms, universally applicable
linear equalities that apply to all finite tests. The practical and immediate
utility of this approach to unsupervised evaluation using only logical
consistency is demonstrated by building no-knowledge alarms that can detect
when one or more LLMs-as-Judges are violating a minimum grading threshold
specified by the user.

Motivation: 随着分布式能源资源特别是可再生能源的集成增加，传统基于固定阈值的保护方案无法在动态条件下可靠识别和定位短路故障，而机器学习方法虽然前景广阔但缺乏系统性的基准研究。

Method: 使用电压和电流波形数据，将其分割为10-50毫秒的滑动窗口，在实时约束下评估经典机器学习模型在故障分类和故障定位任务中的性能。

Result: 最佳故障分类模型F1得分为0.992±0.001，最佳故障定位模型R2得分为0.806±0.008，平均处理时间为0.563毫秒。

Conclusion: 机器学习模型在电力系统保护中表现出色，能够满足实时处理要求，为复杂电网条件下的故障检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing integration of distributed energy resources (DERs),
particularly renewables, poses significant challenges for power system
protection, with fault classification (FC) and fault localization (FL) being
among the most critical tasks. Conventional protection schemes, based on fixed
thresholds, cannot reliably identify and localize short circuits with the
increasing complexity of the grid under dynamic conditions. Machine learning
(ML) offers a promising alternative; however, systematic benchmarks across
models and settings remain limited. This work presents, for the first time, a
comparative benchmarking study of classical ML models for FC and FL in power
system protection based on EMT data. Using voltage and current waveforms
segmented into sliding windows of 10 ms to 50 ms, we evaluate models under
realistic real-time constraints. Performance is assessed in terms of accuracy,
robustness to window size, and runtime efficiency. The best-performing FC model
achieved an F1 score of 0.992$\pm$0.001, while the top FL model reached an R2
of 0.806$\pm$0.008 with a mean processing time of 0.563 ms.

Method: 应用合成少数类过采样技术(SMOTE)，并评估先进的集成学习模型来区分操纵性交易行为与正常市场活动。

Result: SMOTE显著提高了所有模型检测P&D事件的能力，XGBoost和LightGBM分别达到94.87%和93.59%的高召回率，并展现出快速计算性能。

Conclusion: 将数据平衡技术与集成方法相结合，显著提高了操纵活动的早期检测能力，有助于建立更公平、透明和稳定的加密货币市场。

Abstract: This study aims to detect pump and dump (P&D) manipulation in cryptocurrency
markets, where the scarcity of such events causes severe class imbalance and
hinders accurate detection. To address this issue, the Synthetic Minority
Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied, and advanced ensemble learning
models were evaluated to distinguish manipulative trading behavior from normal
market activity. The experimental results show that applying SMOTE greatly
enhanced the ability of all models to detect P&D events by increasing recall
and improving the overall balance between precision and recall. In particular,
XGBoost and LightGBM achieved high recall rates (94.87% and 93.59%,
respectively) with strong F1-scores and demonstrated fast computational
performance, making them suitable for near real time surveillance. These
findings indicate that integrating data balancing techniques with ensemble
methods significantly improves the early detection of manipulative activities,
contributing to a fairer, more transparent, and more stable cryptocurrency
market.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a surge in the number of large language models
(LLMs), yet efficiently managing and utilizing these vast resources remains a
significant challenge. In this work, we explore how to learn compact
representations of LLM abilities that can facilitate downstream tasks, such as
model routing and performance prediction on new benchmarks. We frame this
problem as estimating the probability that a given model will correctly answer
a specific query. Inspired by the item response theory (IRT) in psychometrics,
we model this probability as a function of three key factors: (i) the model's
multi-skill ability vector, (2) the query's discrimination vector that
separates models of differing skills, and (3) the query's difficulty scalar. To
learn these parameters jointly, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) network
that couples model- and query-level embeddings. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach leads to state-of-the-art performance in both
model routing and benchmark accuracy prediction. Moreover, analysis validates
that the learned parameters encode meaningful, interpretable information about
model capabilities and query characteristics.

Abstract: Organizations are increasingly focused on leveraging data from their
processes to gain insights and drive decision-making. However, converting this
data into actionable knowledge remains a difficult and time-consuming task.
There is often a gap between the volume of data collected and the ability to
process and understand it, which automated knowledge discovery aims to fill.
Automated knowledge discovery involves complex open problems, including
effectively navigating data, building models to extract implicit relationships,
and considering subjective goals and knowledge. In this paper, we introduce a
novel method for Automated Insights and Data Exploration (AIDE), that serves as
a robust foundation for tackling these challenges through the use of Monte
Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). We evaluate AIDE using both real-world and synthetic
data, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying data transformations and
models that uncover interesting data patterns. Among its strengths, AIDE's
MCTS-based framework offers significant extensibility, allowing for future
integration of additional pattern extraction strategies and domain knowledge.
This makes AIDE a valuable step towards developing a comprehensive solution for
automated knowledge discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MMKG方法主要将不同模态对齐到共享空间，忽视了特定模态的独特贡献，在低资源设置下性能受限。

Method: 引入适配器模块使每个模态能高效适应未见关系，并采用融合策略在整合多模态实体表示的同时保留模态特定特征。

Result: 在两个基准MMKG数据集上的广泛实验表明，FusionAdapter在少样本关系学习任务上优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: 通过有效适应和融合来自不同模态的信息，FusionAdapter能以最少监督改善对新型关系的泛化能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs) incorporate various modalities, including
text and images, to enhance entity and relation representations. Notably,
different modalities for the same entity often present complementary and
diverse information. However, existing MMKG methods primarily align modalities
into a shared space, which tends to overlook the distinct contributions of
specific modalities, limiting their performance particularly in low-resource
settings. To address this challenge, we propose FusionAdapter for the learning
of few-shot relationships (FSRL) in MMKG. FusionAdapter introduces (1) an
adapter module that enables efficient adaptation of each modality to unseen
relations and (2) a fusion strategy that integrates multimodal entity
representations while preserving diverse modality-specific characteristics. By
effectively adapting and fusing information from diverse modalities,
FusionAdapter improves generalization to novel relations with minimal
supervision. Extensive experiments on two benchmark MMKG datasets demonstrate
that FusionAdapter achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗模仿学习(AIL)方法虽然有效但被认为不稳定。现有研究主要关注密度比估计，而奖励分配函数的作用被忽视，通常依赖人工设计。本文旨在探索基于模仿策略性能的数据驱动奖励分配函数。

Method: 采用LLM引导的进化框架，在奖励分配函数空间中高效探索，开发出首个元学习的AIL算法DAIL。该方法自动发现奖励分配函数而非依赖人工设计。

Result: DAIL在未见过的环境和策略优化算法中表现出良好的泛化能力，超越了当前最先进的人工设计基线方法。

Conclusion: DAIL通过数据驱动的奖励分配函数发现，显著提升了AIL的训练稳定性，并为理解奖励分配函数在AIL稳定性中的作用提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Adversarial Imitation Learning (AIL) methods, while effective in settings
with limited expert demonstrations, are often considered unstable. These
approaches typically decompose into two components: Density Ratio (DR)
estimation $\frac{\rho_E}{\rho_{\pi}}$, where a discriminator estimates the
relative occupancy of state-action pairs under the policy versus the expert;
and Reward Assignment (RA), where this ratio is transformed into a reward
signal used to train the policy. While significant research has focused on
improving density estimation, the role of reward assignment in influencing
training dynamics and final policy performance has been largely overlooked. RA
functions in AIL are typically derived from divergence minimization objectives,
relying heavily on human design and ingenuity. In this work, we take a
different approach: we investigate the discovery of data-driven RA functions,
i.e, based directly on the performance of the resulting imitation policy. To
this end, we leverage an LLM-guided evolutionary framework that efficiently
explores the space of RA functions, yielding \emph{Discovered Adversarial
Imitation Learning} (DAIL), the first meta-learnt AIL algorithm. Remarkably,
DAIL generalises across unseen environments and policy optimization algorithms,
outperforming the current state-of-the-art of \emph{human-designed} baselines.
Finally, we analyse why DAIL leads to more stable training, offering novel
insights into the role of RA functions in the stability of AIL. Code is

<details>

Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的切割分离方法生成的切割数量不足，因为模型对生成多样化子集的敏感性不够。需要提高模型在推理时生成高质量切割的能力。

Method: 1. 在图粗化过程中引入随机边选择，替代之前的贪心方法；2. 提出GraphCHiP算法，利用粗化历史识别RCIs和FCIs。

Result: 在随机生成的CVRP实例上，相比现有神经分离方法，我们的方法能有效减少对偶间隙，并在特定实例上发现了有效的FCIs。

Conclusion: 通过测试时搜索增强策略，能够显著提升训练模型在推理时的性能，生成更多样化和高质量的切割，包括具有挑战性的FCIs。

Abstract: The identification of valid inequalities, such as the rounded capacity
inequalities (RCIs), is a key component of cutting plane methods for the
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). While a deep learning-based
separation method can learn to find high-quality cuts, our analysis reveals
that the model produces fewer cuts than expected because it is insufficiently
sensitive to generate a diverse set of generated subsets. This paper proposes
an alternative: enhancing the performance of a trained model at inference time
through a new test-time search with stochasticity. First, we introduce
stochastic edge selection into the graph coarsening procedure, replacing the
previously proposed greedy approach. Second, we propose the Graph Coarsening
History-based Partitioning (GraphCHiP) algorithm, which leverages coarsening
history to identify not only RCIs but also, for the first time, the Framed
capacity inequalities (FCIs). Experiments on randomly generated CVRP instances
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing the dual gap compared
to the existing neural separation method. Additionally, our method discovers
effective FCIs on a specific instance, despite the challenging nature of
identifying such cuts.

Conclusion: QUASAR框架能有效提升量子电路生成的质量和准确性，为量子计算应用提供可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Designing and optimizing task-specific quantum circuits are crucial to
leverage the advantage of quantum computing. Recent large language model
(LLM)-based quantum circuit generation has emerged as a promising automatic
solution. However, the fundamental challenges remain unaddressed: (i)
parameterized quantum gates require precise numerical values for optimal
performance, which also depend on multiple aspects, including the number of
quantum gates, their parameters, and the layout/depth of the circuits. (ii)
LLMs often generate low-quality or incorrect quantum circuits due to the lack
of quantum domain-specific knowledge. We propose QUASAR, an agentic
reinforcement learning (RL) framework for quantum circuits generation and
optimization based on tool-augmented LLMs. To align the LLM with
quantum-specific knowledge and improve the generated quantum circuits, QUASAR
designs (i) a quantum circuit verification approach with external quantum
simulators and (ii) a sophisticated hierarchical reward mechanism in RL
training. Extensive evaluation shows improvements in both syntax and semantic
performance of the generated quantum circuits. When augmenting a 4B LLM, QUASAR
has achieved the validity of 99.31% in Pass@1 and 100% in Pass@10,
outperforming industrial LLMs of GPT-4o, GPT-5 and DeepSeek-V3 and several
supervised-fine-tuning (SFT)-only and RL-only baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了AFFR框架，整合了元学习联邦优化、能量感知客户端调度和安全聚合，用于解决罕见病诊断中的数据稀缺、设备掉线和隐私保护问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见病诊断面临数据稀缺、隐私担忧和边缘设备资源有限的挑战，需要一种能在真实临床网络中部署的解决方案。

Method: 结合三个支柱：基于元学习的少样本联邦优化、能量感知客户端调度、以及带有校准差分隐私的安全聚合。

Result: 在模拟罕见病检测数据集上，相比基线联邦学习准确率提升10%，客户端掉线率降低50%以上，隐私-效用权衡保持在临床可接受范围内。

Conclusion: AFFR为罕见病的公平可信联邦诊断提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Rare-disease diagnosis remains one of the most pressing challenges in digital
health, hindered by extreme data scarcity, privacy concerns, and the limited
resources of edge devices. This paper proposes the Adaptive Federated Few-Shot
Rare-Disease Diagnosis (AFFR) framework, which integrates three pillars: (i)
few-shot federated optimization with meta-learning to generalize from limited
patient samples, (ii) energy-aware client scheduling to mitigate device
dropouts and ensure balanced participation, and (iii) secure aggregation with
calibrated differential privacy to safeguard sensitive model updates. Unlike
prior work that addresses these aspects in isolation, AFFR unifies them into a
modular pipeline deployable on real-world clinical networks. Experimental
evaluation on simulated rare-disease detection datasets demonstrates up to 10%
improvement in accuracy compared with baseline FL, while reducing client
dropouts by over 50% without degrading convergence. Furthermore,
privacy-utility trade-offs remain within clinically acceptable bounds. These
findings highlight AFFR as a practical pathway for equitable and trustworthy
federated diagnosis of rare conditions.

TL;DR: 提出一个售后需求预测和监控的统一架构，结合统计、机器学习和深度学习模型，并集成角色驱动的分析层，用于生成记分卡和趋势诊断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决售后需求预测的复杂性，整合多种外部信号，将COVID-19作为特殊制度处理，并为不同业务角色提供可操作的洞察。

Method: 使用收入感知和聚类感知的集成模型，结合外生信号（安装基础、定价、宏观指标等），采用帕累托分割策略，并通过LLM生成角色化叙述。

Result: 系统在90多个国家和约6000个零件上实现闭环预测、监控和库存决策，提供校准的区间预测和业务相关的损失对齐。

Conclusion: 该框架成功将预测准确性转化为可操作的业务洞察，帮助规划者从评估当前准确性转向预测未来趋势并确定改进杠杆。

Abstract: This paper presents a practical architecture for after-sales demand
forecasting and monitoring that unifies a revenue- and cluster-aware ensemble
of statistical, machine-learning, and deep-learning models with a role-driven
analytics layer for scorecards and trend diagnostics. The framework ingests
exogenous signals (installed base, pricing, macro indicators, life cycle,
seasonality) and treats COVID-19 as a distinct regime, producing country-part
forecasts with calibrated intervals. A Pareto-aware segmentation forecasts
high-revenue items individually and pools the long tail via clusters, while
horizon-aware ensembling aligns weights with business-relevant losses (e.g.,
WMAPE). Beyond forecasts, a performance scorecard delivers decision-focused
insights: accuracy within tolerance thresholds by revenue share and count, bias
decomposition (over- vs under-forecast), geographic and product-family
hotspots, and ranked root causes tied to high-impact part-country pairs. A
trend module tracks trajectories of MAPE/WMAPE and bias across recent months,
flags entities that are improving or deteriorating, detects change points
aligned with known regimes, and attributes movements to lifecycle and seasonal
factors. LLMs are embedded in the analytics layer to generate role-aware
narratives and enforce reporting contracts. They standardize business
definitions, automate quality checks and reconciliations, and translate
quantitative results into concise, explainable summaries for planners and
executives. The system exposes a reproducible workflow -- request
specification, model execution, database-backed artifacts, and AI-generated
narratives -- so planners can move from "How accurate are we now?" to "Where is
accuracy heading and which levers should we pull?", closing the loop between
forecasting, monitoring, and inventory decisions across more than 90 countries
and about 6,000 parts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法只能发现特定特征的特定几何结构，缺乏泛化能力，需要一种模型无关的方法来自动发现特征流形。

Method: 引入监督多维缩放（SMDS）方法，以时间推理为案例研究，自动发现特征流形的几何结构。

Result: 发现不同特征形成圆形、直线、聚类等多种几何结构，这些结构稳定、反映概念特性、支持推理并随上下文动态重塑。

Conclusion: 特征流形在语言模型中具有功能性作用，支持基于实体的推理模型，语言模型编码并转换结构化表示。

Abstract: The linear representation hypothesis states that language models (LMs) encode
concepts as directions in their latent space, forming organized,
multidimensional manifolds. Prior efforts focus on discovering specific
geometries for specific features, and thus lack generalization. We introduce
Supervised Multi-Dimensional Scaling (SMDS), a model-agnostic method to
automatically discover feature manifolds. We apply SMDS to temporal reasoning
as a case study, finding that different features form various geometric
structures such as circles, lines, and clusters. SMDS reveals many insights on
these structures: they consistently reflect the properties of the concepts they
represent; are stable across model families and sizes; actively support
reasoning in models; and dynamically reshape in response to context changes.
Together, our findings shed light on the functional role of feature manifolds,
supporting a model of entity-based reasoning in which LMs encode and transform
structured representations.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了70多个不同架构的LLM在概念表示上与人类的对齐程度，发现指令微调和注意力头维度是影响对齐的关键因素，而多模态预训练和参数大小影响有限。现有基准测试无法完全捕捉人类-AI对齐度。


<details>

Motivation: 当前LLM的快速发展带来了多种计算要素，但尚不清楚哪些要素对构建具有人类类似表示的模型最为关键。现有基准测试不适合测量人类与模型之间的表示对齐度。

Method: 使用认知科学中成熟的三元组相似性任务，评估70多个不同计算要素的模型在THINGS数据库概念上的表示对齐度。

Result: 经过指令微调的模型和具有更大注意力头维度的模型与人类表示最对齐；多模态预训练和参数大小对对齐度影响有限；现有基准测试无法完全解释对齐度方差。

Conclusion: 指令微调和注意力头维度是推进LLM成为人类概念表示模型的关键计算要素，同时指出了当前LLM评估中的基准测试不足问题。

Abstract: The ability to translate diverse patterns of inputs into structured patterns
of behavior has been thought to rest on both humans' and machines' ability to
learn robust representations of relevant concepts. The rapid advancement of
transformer-based large language models (LLMs) has led to a diversity of
computational ingredients -- architectures, fine tuning methods, and training
datasets among others -- but it remains unclear which of these ingredients are
most crucial for building models that develop human-like representations.
Further, most current LLM benchmarks are not suited to measuring
representational alignment between humans and models, making benchmark scores
unreliable for assessing if current LLMs are making progress towards becoming
useful cognitive models. We address these limitations by first evaluating a set
of over 70 models that widely vary in their computational ingredients on a
triplet similarity task, a method well established in the cognitive sciences
for measuring human conceptual representations, using concepts from the THINGS
database. Comparing human and model representations, we find that models that
undergo instruction-finetuning and which have larger dimensionality of
attention heads are among the most human aligned, while multimodal pretraining
and parameter size have limited bearing on alignment. Correlations between
alignment scores and scores on existing benchmarks reveal that while some
benchmarks (e.g., MMLU) are better suited than others (e.g., MUSR) for
capturing representational alignment, no existing benchmark is capable of fully
accounting for the variance of alignment scores, demonstrating their
insufficiency in capturing human-AI alignment. Taken together, our findings
help highlight the computational ingredients most essential for advancing LLMs
towards models of human conceptual representation and address a key
benchmarking gap in LLM evaluation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的前向传播范式Activation-Deactivation (AD)，通过关闭与遮挡部分对应的模型组件来避免生成超出分布范围的图像，从而获得更鲁棒的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的黑盒可解释性方法依赖遮挡输入部分生成的突变体，这些突变体会产生超出分布范围的图像，影响解释质量，且选择合适遮挡值需要领域知识。

Method: 引入ConvAD机制，可以轻松添加到任何训练好的卷积神经网络中，实现AD范式，无需额外训练或微调。

Result: 实验表明AD解释相比遮挡方法在鲁棒性上提升高达62.5%，且不需要领域知识就能提取更鲁棒的解释。

Conclusion: ConvAD机制能够在不改变网络决策过程的情况下，提供更鲁棒的解释，解决了传统遮挡方法的问题。

Abstract: Black-box explainability methods are popular tools for explaining the
decisions of image classifiers. A major drawback of these tools is their
reliance on mutants obtained by occluding parts of the input, leading to
out-of-distribution images. This raises doubts about the quality of the
explanations. Moreover, choosing an appropriate occlusion value often requires
domain knowledge. In this paper we introduce a novel forward-pass paradigm
Activation-Deactivation (AD), which removes the effects of occluded input
features from the model's decision-making by switching off the parts of the
model that correspond to the occlusions. We introduce ConvAD, a drop-in
mechanism that can be easily added to any trained Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN), and which implements the AD paradigm. This leads to more robust
explanations without any additional training or fine-tuning. We prove that the
ConvAD mechanism does not change the decision-making process of the network. We
provide experimental evaluation across several datasets and model
architectures. We compare the quality of AD-explanations with explanations
achieved using a set of masking values, using the proxies of robustness, size,
and confidence drop-off. We observe a consistent improvement in robustness of
AD explanations (up to 62.5%) compared to explanations obtained with
occlusions, demonstrating that ConvAD extracts more robust explanations without
the need for domain knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CoT提示增强了LLM的推理能力，但生成推理过程的忠实性仍是模型可解释性的开放问题，需要超越启发式解释的形式验证方法。

Method: 利用Curry-Howard对应关系，将非正式的自然语言推理步骤提取并映射到形式化的类型证明结构中，成功转换意味着获得可验证的计算忠实性证书。

Result: 建立了将可信的叙述性解释转化为形式化可验证程序的方法论，为推理忠实性提供了强验证机制。

Conclusion: 该框架为实现更可靠和可信赖的AI系统提供了一条路径，从启发式可解释性向形式验证迈进。

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enhances the reasoning capabilities of
large language models, the faithfulness of the generated rationales remains an
open problem for model interpretability. We propose a novel theoretical lens
for this problem grounded in the Curry-Howard correspondence, which posits a
direct relationship between formal proofs and computer programs. Under this
paradigm, a faithful reasoning trace is analogous to a well-typed program,
where each intermediate step corresponds to a typed logical inference. We
operationalise this analogy, presenting methods to extract and map the
informal, natural language steps of CoT into a formal, typed proof structure.
Successfully converting a CoT trace into a well-typed proof serves as a strong,
verifiable certificate of its computational faithfulness, moving beyond
heuristic interpretability towards formal verification. Our framework provides
a methodology to transform plausible narrative explanations into formally
verifiable programs, offering a path towards building more reliable and
trustworthy AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏通用标准和可靠的内容验证器，难以获得有效的训练信号来确保LLM安全。研究发现对齐模型已具备强大的内部安全信念，这为利用内部信号进行安全对齐提供了可能。

Method: 提出Safety Instincts Reinforcement Learning (SIRL)，将模型拒绝有害请求时的高置信度转化为自生成奖励信号，通过强化低熵拒绝行为来教导模型信任自身安全本能。

Result: 在Llama和Qwen模型上评估，SIRL对20多种越狱方法保持89%+的防御成功率，仅使用15,000个未标注提示就超越了资源密集的监督方法，同时在数学、编程和对话基准上保持性能。

Conclusion: 有效对齐可以从模型内部产生，为无需大量人工监督的自主、鲁棒AI安全机制开辟了道路。

Abstract: Ensuring Large Language Model (LLM) safety remains challenging due to the
absence of universal standards and reliable content validators, making it
difficult to obtain effective training signals. We discover that aligned models
already possess robust internal safety beliefs: they consistently produce
high-confidence refusals to harmful requests while exhibiting high entropy when
generating potentially dangerous content. This entropy gap reveals an untapped
signal--models intrinsically "know" when to refuse. We introduce Safety
Instincts Reinforcement Learning (SIRL), which transforms this internal
confidence into a self-generated reward signal, eliminating dependence on
external validators or human annotations. SIRL teaches models to trust their
safety instincts by reinforcing low-entropy refusal behaviors. Evaluated on
Llama and Qwen models, SIRL maintains 89%+ Defense Success Rates (DSRs) against
20+ jailbreak methods, from static prompts to adaptive attacks. Using only
15,000 unlabeled prompts, SIRL surpasses resource-intensive supervised methods
while preserving performance on mathematics, coding, and conversation
benchmarks. Our work demonstrates that effective alignment can emerge from
within, paving the way for more autonomous and robust AI safety mechanisms that
scale without extensive human oversight.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统生产计划中忽视人力资源因素的局限性，同时优化运营效率和员工公平性，实现以人为本的制造业调度。

Method: 第一层使用约束规划(CP)进行订单-产线分配，第二层使用马尔可夫决策过程(MDP)进行工人-产线分配，并比较贪婪分配、MCTS和RL三种策略。

Result: CP调度产生紧凑可行的生产计划，MDP人员分配显著提高公平性和偏好匹配度，领域专家评估两个组件都有效。

Conclusion: 结合约束规划和学习型决策制定为人本生产计划提供了稳健方法，能同时优化吞吐量和员工福祉。

Abstract: This work presents a two-layer, human-centric production planning framework
designed to optimize both operational efficiency and workforce fairness in
industrial manufacturing. The first layer formulates the Order-Line allocation
as a Constraint Programming (CP) problem, generating high-utilization
production schedules that respect machine capacities, processing times, and due
dates. The second layer models Worker-Line allocation as a Markov Decision
Process (MDP), integrating human factors such as worker preference, experience,
resilience, and medical constraints into the assignment process. Three solution
strategies, greedy allocation, MCTS, and RL, are implemented and compared
across multiple evaluation scenarios. The proposed system is validated through
16 test sessions with domain experts from the automotive industry, combining
quantitative key performance indicators (KPIs) with expert ratings. Results
indicate that the CP-based scheduling approach produces compact, feasible
production plans with low tardiness, while the MDP-based worker allocation
significantly improves fairness and preference alignment compared to baseline
approaches. Domain experts rated both the Order-Line and Worker-Line components
as effective and highlighted opportunities to further refine the objective
function to penalize excessive earliness and improve continuity in worker
assignments. Overall, the findings demonstrate that combining CP with
learning-based decision-making provides a robust approach for human-centric
production planning. The approach enables simultaneous optimization of
throughput and workforce well-being, offering a practical foundation for fair
and efficient manufacturing scheduling in industrial settings.

Conclusion: 该框架为安全、可审计、低延迟的大规模咨询提供了实用路径，并概述了外部/时间复制、非对称生命威胁阈值和多标签仲裁等验证步骤，以满足前瞻性临床部署标准。

Abstract: We present PRISM-Consult, a clinician-aligned panel-of-experts architecture
that extends the compact PRISM sequence model into a routed family of domain
specialists. Episodes are tokenized as structured clinical events; a
light-weight router reads the first few tokens and dispatches to specialist
models (Cardiac-Vascular, Pulmonary, Gastro-Oesophageal, Musculoskeletal,
Psychogenic). Each specialist inherits PRISM's small transformer backbone and
token template, enabling parameter efficiency and interpretability. On
real-world Emergency Department cohorts, specialists exhibit smooth convergence
with low development perplexities across domains, while the router achieves
high routing quality and large compute savings versus consult-all under a
safety-first policy. We detail the data methodology (initial vs. conclusive
ICD-9 families), routing thresholds and calibration, and report per-domain
results to avoid dominance by common events. The framework provides a practical
path to safe, auditable, and low-latency consult at scale, and we outline
validation steps-external/temporal replication, asymmetric life-threat
thresholds, and multi-label arbitration-to meet prospective clinical deployment
standards.

Abstract: We present Apriel-1.5-15B-Thinker, a 15-billion parameter open-weights
multimodal reasoning model that achieves frontier-level performance through
training design rather than sheer scale. Starting from Pixtral-12B, we apply a
progressive three-stage methodology: (1) depth upscaling to expand reasoning
capacity without pretraining from scratch, (2) staged continual pre-training
that first develops foundational text and vision understanding, then enhances
visual reasoning through targeted synthetic data generation addressing spatial
structure, compositional understanding, and fine-grained perception, and (3)
high-quality text-only supervised fine-tuning on curated instruction-response
pairs with explicit reasoning traces spanning mathematics, coding, science, and
tool use. Notably, our model achieves competitive results without reinforcement
learning or preference optimization, isolating the contribution of our
data-centric continual pre-training approach. On the Artificial Analysis
Intelligence Index, Apriel-1.5-15B-Thinker attains a score of 52, matching
DeepSeek-R1-0528 despite requiring significantly fewer computational resources.
Across ten image benchmarks, its performance is on average within five points
of Gemini-2.5-Flash and Claude Sonnet-3.7, a key achievement for a model
operating within single-GPU deployment constraints. Our results demonstrate
that thoughtful mid-training 2 design can close substantial capability gaps
without massive scale, making frontier-level multimodal reasoning accessible to
organizations with limited infrastructure. We release the model checkpoint, all

TL;DR: Bridge方法通过重新思考批量LLM隐藏状态作为整体张量而非独立切片，生成相互依赖的并行响应，仅需少量新参数即可显著提升响应质量和一致性。


<details>

Motivation: 传统并行LLM推理中，N个响应独立生成，计算资源被分割，一个生成中的有用信息无法被其他生成利用，这与响应长度扩展中过去计算用于所有未来步骤形成对比。

Method: 提出Bridge方法，将批量LLM隐藏状态重新概念化为整体张量而非独立切片，生成相互依赖的并行响应，仅需添加少量新参数（2.8%-5.1%）。

Result: Bridge将基于可验证奖励的强化学习的相对平均准确率增益提升高达50%，并提高了正确响应的一致性。训练一次即可扩展到任何生成宽度，性能均优于独立生成。

Conclusion: Bridge解锁了一种更通用的并行扩展模式，有效利用序列间的信息，兼容任何后生成聚合技术。

Abstract: Parallel LLM inference scaling involves sampling a set of $N>1$ responses for
a single input prompt. However, these $N$ parallel responses tend to be
generated independently from each other, partitioning compute resources and
leaving potentially useful information in one generation untapped by others.
This is in contrast to response length scaling where past computation is used
in all future steps. For higher quality responses and response sets, we propose
Bridge to generate interdependent responses in parallel by rethinking batched
LLM hidden states as holistic tensors rather than independent slices. With only
a small amount (2.8%-5.1%) of new parameters, Bridge improves the relative mean
accuracy gains from reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards by up to 50%
and boosts consistency of correct responses. Trained once, Bridge scales to any
generation width, all with greater performance than independent generations,
unlocking a more general mode of parallel scaling that effectively leverages
information between sequences, compatible with any post-generation aggregation
technique.

Abstract: Autonomous inspection systems are essential for ensuring the performance and
longevity of industrial assets. Recently, agentic frameworks have demonstrated
significant potential for automating inspection workflows but have been limited
to digital tasks. Their application to physical assets in real-world
environments, however, remains underexplored. In this work, our contributions
are two-fold: first, we propose a hierarchical agentic framework for autonomous
drone control, and second, a reasoning methodology for individual function
executions which we refer to as ReActEval. Our framework focuses on visual
inspection tasks in indoor industrial settings, such as interpreting industrial
readouts or inspecting equipment. It employs a multi-agent system comprising a
head agent and multiple worker agents, each controlling a single drone. The
head agent performs high-level planning and evaluates outcomes, while worker
agents implement ReActEval to reason over and execute low-level actions.
Operating entirely in natural language, ReActEval follows a plan, reason, act,
evaluate cycle, enabling drones to handle tasks ranging from simple navigation
(e.g., flying forward 10 meters and land) to complex high-level tasks (e.g.,
locating and reading a pressure gauge). The evaluation phase serves as a
feedback and/or replanning stage, ensuring actions align with user objectives
while preventing undesirable outcomes. We evaluate the framework in a simulated
environment with two worker agents, assessing performance qualitatively and
quantitatively based on task completion across varying complexity levels and
workflow efficiency. By leveraging natural language processing for agent
communication, our approach offers a novel, flexible, and user-accessible
alternative to traditional drone-based solutions, enabling autonomous
problem-solving for industrial inspection without extensive user intervention.

Motivation: 大型语言模型使复杂的多智能体系统成为可能，但通过提示工程协调它们的推理能力仍然具有挑战性。需要解决智能体转换过程中的逻辑一致性、推理感知提示适应和分布式推理的可扩展协调问题。

Method: 使用提示模板、推理上下文向量和能力矩阵形式化智能体状态。证明当步长满足α<1/2L时系统收敛到稳定协调模式。通过分布式架构动态路由推理任务，同时保持语义连贯性。

Result: 在1000个合成多智能体对话实验中，推理延迟减少42%，逻辑一致性（ROUGE-L得分）提高23%，智能体转换中无上下文丢失的任务完成成功率达89%。

Conclusion: 为多智能体系统中的可扩展推理建立了新范式，为理解协调语言模型中推理涌现提供了理论基础，但系统在超过10次智能体转换后性能下降，1000个并发智能体需要76.5GB内存。

Abstract: The emergence of large language models has enabled sophisticated multi-agent
systems, yet coordinating their reasoning capabilities through prompt
engineering remains challenging. We present a theoretically-grounded framework
for dynamic prompt orchestration that enhances reasoning across multiple
specialized agents. This framework addresses three core challenges: logical
consistency preservation during agent transitions, reasoning-aware prompt
adaptation, and scalable coordination of distributed inference.
  Our approach formalizes agent states using prompt templates, reasoning
context vectors, and capability matrices. We prove system convergence to stable
coordination patterns when step sizes satisfy $\alpha < \frac{1}{2L}$ where $L$
is the Lipschitz constant of the state transition function. We implement this
through a distributed architecture that dynamically routes reasoning tasks
while maintaining semantic coherence.
  Experimental results on 1,000 synthetic multi-agent conversations demonstrate
a 42% reduction in reasoning latency, a 23% improvement in logical consistency
measured by ROUGE-L score, and an 89% success rate for task completion without
context loss across agent transitions. Ablation studies identify the consensus
mechanism as the primary performance driver, while revealing limitations:
performance degrades beyond 10 agent transitions, and the system requires
76.5GB memory for 1,000 concurrent agents. These findings establish a new
paradigm for scalable reasoning in multi-agent systems, providing theoretical
foundations for understanding reasoning emergence across coordinated language
models.

TL;DR: 提出CBS协议作为异构机器人系统的通用运动规划框架，使不同制造商的机器人能够在共享环境中高效无碰撞移动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决未来多机器人环境中，来自不同制造商的异构机器人系统如何有效协调运动的问题，每个机器人可能有独立的运动规划系统。

Method: 使用基于冲突的搜索(CBS)作为协议，仅要求每个机器人提供满足特定时空约束的无碰撞路径规划API，中央规划器利用这些API进行协调。

Result: CBS协议成功实现了异构多智能体运动规划，支持包括启发式搜索、采样搜索、优化、扩散和强化学习等多种单智能体规划器。

Conclusion: CBS协议为异构机器人团队提供了一种有效的运动规划解决方案，能够协调不同算法实现的机器人系统在共享环境中完成独立任务。

Abstract: Imagine the future construction site, hospital, office, or even sophisticated
household with dozens of robots bought from different manufacturers. How can we
enable these different systems to effectively move in a shared environment,
given that each robot may have its own independent motion planning system? This
work shows how we can get efficient collision-free movements between
algorithmically heterogeneous agents by using Conflict-Based Search (Sharon et
al. 2015) as a protocol. At its core, the CBS Protocol requires one specific
single-agent motion planning API; finding a collision-free path that satisfies
certain space-time constraints. Given such an API, CBS uses a central planner
to find collision-free paths - independent of how the API is implemented. We
show how this protocol enables multi-agent motion planning for a heterogeneous
team of agents completing independent tasks with a variety of single-agent
planners including: Heuristic Search (e.g., A*), Sampling Based Search (e.g.,
RRT), Optimization (e.g., Direct Collocation), Diffusion, and Reinforcement
Learning.

TL;DR: 提出了SelfOrg框架，通过基于Shapley值评估代理贡献并构建有向无环图来动态优化多智能体系统的通信结构，实现无需额外监督的自组织协作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的多智能体系统大多依赖固定拓扑结构或外部评估，增加了复杂性。需要一种能够动态适应通信结构的方法来优化协作效果。

Method: 采用响应条件化框架，代理独立生成响应后使用Shapley值近似评估同伴贡献，构建有向无环图来调控响应传播，确保高贡献代理的信息优先传递。

Result: 实验表明该方法在强弱LLM后端均表现稳健，在弱LLM场景下显著优于现有方法，理论分析证明多代理能提高正确性概率。

Conclusion: SelfOrg框架通过动态通信结构优化实现了高效的多智能体协作，特别在弱LLM场景下表现出色，正确响应自然主导信息流。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have the
potential to solve tasks that are beyond the reach of any single LLM. However,
this potential can only be realized when the collaboration mechanism between
agents is optimized. Specifically, optimizing the communication structure
between agents is critical for fruitful collaboration. Most existing approaches
rely on fixed topologies, pretrained graph generators, optimization over edges,
or employ external LLM judges, thereby adding to the complexity. In this work,
we introduce a response-conditioned framework that adapts communication
on-the-fly. Agents independently generate responses to the user query and
assess peer contributions using an approximation of the Shapley value. A
directed acyclic graph (DAG) is then constructed to regulate the propagation of
the responses among agents, which ensures stable and efficient message
transmission from high-contributing agents to others. This graph is dynamically
updated based on the agent responses from the previous collaboration round.
Since the proposed framework enables the self-organization of agents without
additional supervision or training, we refer to it as SelfOrg. The SelfOrg
framework goes beyond task- and query-level optimization and takes into account
the stochastic nature of agent responses. Experiments with both strong and weak
LLM backends demonstrate robust performance, with significant gains in the weak
regime where prior methods collapse. We also theoretically show that multiple
agents increase the chance of correctness and that the correct responses
naturally dominate the information flow.

Motivation: 现有弹性共识方法需要整个网络的鲁棒性条件，但这些条件不满足时的系统行为尚未研究

Method: 提出BP-MSR算法，结合引导渗透和均值子序列约减技术，在任意时变图中实现部分共识

Result: 验证了BP-MSR算法能保证部分领导者-跟随者共识，即使标准弹性共识算法失效

Conclusion: 该方法扩展了弹性共识的应用范围，在鲁棒性条件不足时仍能保证部分跟随者达成共识

Abstract: This work studies resilient leader-follower consensus with a bounded number
of adversaries. Existing approaches typically require robustness conditions of
the entire network to guarantee resilient consensus. However, the behavior of
such systems when these conditions are not fully met remains unexplored. To
address this gap, we introduce the notion of partial leader-follower consensus,
in which a subset of non-adversarial followers successfully tracks the leader's
reference state despite insufficient robustness. We propose a novel distributed
algorithm - the Bootstrap Percolation and Mean Subsequence Reduced (BP-MSR)
algorithm - and establish sufficient conditions for individual followers to
achieve consensus via the BP-MSR algorithm in arbitrary time-varying graphs. We
validate our findings through simulations, demonstrating that our method
guarantees partial leader-follower consensus, even when standard resilient
consensus algorithms fail.

TL;DR: 提出了一种量化RAG测试问题语义覆盖度的新方法，通过向量嵌入和聚类算法评估测试集对知识库的覆盖完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG系统评估缺乏系统化方法来确保测试集充分覆盖底层知识库，导致开发者存在盲点。

Method: 将文档块和测试问题嵌入统一向量空间，计算基础邻近度、内容加权覆盖度和多主题问题覆盖度等指标，并集成异常检测来过滤无关问题。

Result: 两个不同用例的实验证明，该框架能有效量化测试覆盖度，识别代表性不足的内容区域，并为生成新的高价值测试问题提供具体建议。

Conclusion: 为RAG开发者提供了构建更健壮测试套件的关键工具，从而提高系统可靠性，并可扩展到识别未对齐文档等应用。

Abstract: Reliably determining the performance of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
systems depends on comprehensive test questions. While a proliferation of
evaluation frameworks for LLM-powered applications exists, current practices
lack a systematic method to ensure these test sets adequately cover the
underlying knowledge base, leaving developers with significant blind spots. To
address this, we present a novel, applied methodology to quantify the semantic
coverage of RAG test questions against their underlying documents. Our approach
leverages existing technologies, including vector embeddings and clustering
algorithms, to create a practical framework for validating test
comprehensiveness. Our methodology embeds document chunks and test questions
into a unified vector space, enabling the calculation of multiple coverage
metrics: basic proximity, content-weighted coverage, and multi-topic question
coverage. Furthermore, we incorporate outlier detection to filter irrelevant
questions, allowing for the refinement of test sets. Experimental evidence from
two distinct use cases demonstrates that our framework effectively quantifies
test coverage, identifies specific content areas with inadequate
representation, and provides concrete recommendations for generating new,
high-value test questions. This work provides RAG developers with essential
tools to build more robust test suites, thereby improving system reliability
and extending to applications such as identifying misaligned documents.

TL;DR: Thoughtbubbles是一种变压器变体，通过在潜在空间中学习分叉或删除残差流来执行并行自适应计算，使需要大量计算的token能够在网络中间形成克隆残差的"气泡"进行额外思考。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于显式思维链token的方法存在局限性：无法在预训练期间应用，且仅限于串行生成的自然语言表达来扩展推理时计算。

Method: 提出Thoughtbubbles变压器变体，在潜在空间中学习分叉或删除残差流，实现并行自适应计算。关键特性是仅使用语言建模损失在预训练期间学习这种行为。

Result: 在OpenWebText和peS2o困惑度以及HellaSwag和LAMBADA等零样本评估中，Thoughtbubbles在1.5亿到7.72亿参数规模上都优于标准解码器语言模型和非自适应并行计算方法。

Conclusion: 该方法的隐式特性使得自适应计算可以从预训练开始学习，为统一训练和测试时推理模型行为铺平了道路。

Abstract: Current approaches for scaling inference-time compute in transformers rely on
training them to emit explicit chain-of-thought tokens before producing an
answer. While these methods are powerful, they are limited because they cannot
be applied during pretraining and are limited to only serially-generated,
natural-language verbalization to scale inference-time compute. In this work,
we propose Thoughtbubbles, a transformer variant that natively performs
parallel adaptive computation in latent space by learning to fork or delete
residual streams. Thus, tokens that require a large amount of computation can
form a "bubble" of cloned residuals in the middle of the network for additional
thinking. Crucially, this behavior is learned during pretraining with only
language modeling loss. Thoughtbubbles outperforms both standard decoder LMs as
well as non-adaptive parallel computation approaches on OpenWebText and peS2o
perplexity and in zero-shot evaluations such as HellaSwag and LAMBADA after
pretraining across 150M to 772M parameter scales. The implicit nature of our
method enables adaptive computation to be learned starting at pretraining time,
paving the way to unify train and test-time behavior for reasoning models.

TL;DR: TransIP是一种基于Transformer的原子间势能模型，通过嵌入空间优化实现SO(3)等变性，无需硬编码的架构约束，在OMol25数据集上达到与最先进等变基线相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的机器学习原子间势能模型通过等变神经网络架构强制施加旋转平移对称性，这种硬编码的归纳偏置往往导致灵活性、计算效率和可扩展性降低。

Method: 引入TransIP：基于Transformer的原子间势能，这是一种新颖的训练范式，通过优化嵌入空间表示来引导通用非等变Transformer模型学习SO(3)等变性，无需显式架构约束。

Result: 在OMol25数据集上，TransIP在机器学习力场方面达到与最先进等变基线相当的性能。与数据增强基线相比，在不同OMol25数据集规模下性能提升40%到60%。

Conclusion: 学习得到的等变性可以成为等变或基于数据增强的MLIP模型的强大而高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Accurate and scalable machine-learned inter-atomic potentials (MLIPs) are
essential for molecular simulations ranging from drug discovery to new material
design. Current state-of-the-art models enforce roto-translational symmetries
through equivariant neural network architectures, a hard-wired inductive bias
that can often lead to reduced flexibility, computational efficiency, and
scalability. In this work, we introduce TransIP: Transformer-based Inter-Atomic
Potentials, a novel training paradigm for interatomic potentials achieving
symmetry compliance without explicit architectural constraints. Our approach
guides a generic non-equivariant Transformer-based model to learn
SO(3)-equivariance by optimizing its representations in the embedding space.
Trained on the recent Open Molecules (OMol25) collection, a large and diverse
molecular dataset built specifically for MLIPs and covering different types of
molecules (including small organics, biomolecular fragments, and
electrolyte-like species), TransIP attains comparable performance in
machine-learning force fields versus state-of-the-art equivariant baselines.
Further, compared to a data augmentation baseline, TransIP achieves 40% to 60%
improvement in performance across varying OMol25 dataset sizes. More broadly,
our work shows that learned equivariance can be a powerful and efficient
alternative to equivariant or augmentation-based MLIP models.

Result: 在控制任务上实现了更高的回报和更好的样本效率，相比纯LLM引导搜索有显著提升

Conclusion: 结合符号程序合成与数值优化能够产生可解释且高性能的策略，弥合了语言模型引导设计与经典控制调优之间的差距

Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) have shown promise as generators of symbolic
control policies, producing interpretable program-like representations through
iterative search. However, these models are not capable of separating the
functional structure of a policy from the numerical values it is parametrized
by, thus making the search process slow and inefficient. We propose a hybrid
approach that decouples structural synthesis from parameter optimization by
introducing an additional optimization layer for local parameter search. In our
method, the numerical parameters of LLM-generated programs are extracted and
optimized numerically to maximize task performance. With this integration, an
LLM iterates over the functional structure of programs, while a separate
optimization loop is used to find a locally optimal set of parameters
accompanying candidate programs. We evaluate our method on a set of control
tasks, showing that it achieves higher returns and improved sample efficiency
compared to purely LLM-guided search. We show that combining symbolic program
synthesis with numerical optimization yields interpretable yet high-performing
policies, bridging the gap between language-model-guided design and classical
control tuning. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了RoPE位置插值与后训练量化结合时出现的精度下降问题，提出了Q-ROAR方法来解决这些问题，通过分组频率带和轻量级搜索来稳定量化LLM的长上下文性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展大语言模型的上下文窗口对于处理长距离依赖任务至关重要。RoPE插值方法可以在不重新训练的情况下支持更长的输入长度，而后训练量化使部署变得实用。但研究发现，将RoPE位置插值与PTQ结合会因多种耦合效应导致精度下降。

Method: 提出了Q-ROAR方法：将RoPE维度分组到少量频率带中，对Key和Query权重执行轻量级的每带尺度搜索，搜索过程由插值压力和尾部膨胀比率诊断指导，使用小型长上下文开发数据集，无需微调模型或改变架构。

Result: Q-ROAR在长上下文工作负载上将模型的困惑度降低了14%以上，同时保持了短上下文性能、推理吞吐量以及与现有LLM系统堆栈的兼容性。

Conclusion: Q-ROAR提供了一种有效的方法来解决RoPE插值与量化结合时的精度问题，通过插值感知的稳定化处理，在保持部署效率的同时显著提升了长上下文性能。

Abstract: Extending the context window support of large language models (LLMs) is
crucial for tasks with long-distance dependencies. RoPE-based interpolation and
extrapolation methods, such as linear scaling and frequency-aware schemes,
enable longer input length support without retraining, while post-training
quantization (PTQ) makes deployment practical. However, we show that combining
RoPE position interpolation (PI) with PTQ degrades accuracy due to coupled
effects including long-context aliasing, dynamic-range dilation, anisotropy
from axis-aligned quantizers vs. rotated RoPE pairs, and outlier shifting that
produces position-dependent logit noise. We provide, to the best of our
knowledge, the first systematic analysis of the PI+PTQ approach and introduce
two practical diagnostics: interpolation pressure (per-band sensitivity to
phase scaling) and tail-inflation ratios (outlier shift from short to long
contexts). Following the analysis results, we propose Q-ROAR (Quantization,
RoPE-interpolation, and Outlier Aware Rescaling), a weight-only,
interpolation-aware stabilization of PI for quantized LLMs. Q-ROAR groups RoPE
dimensions into a small number of frequency bands and performs a lightweight
search over per-band scales for Key and Query weights (with an optional
symmetric variant to preserve logit scale). The search is guided by our
diagnostics and uses a tiny long-context development dataset, requiring no
fine-tuning to the model, no architecture or kernel changes, and no additional
deployment overhead. Empirically, Q-ROAR reduces the model's perplexity on
long-context workloads by more than 14%, while preserving short-context
performance, inference throughput, and compatibility with existing LLM system
stacks.

Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning has been a promising data-driven and
physics-informed approach in geotechnical engineering. This study proposes a
physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM) framework for analyzing
tunneling-induced soil-pile interactions. The pile foundation is modeled as an
Euler-Bernoulli beam, and the surrounding soil is modeled as a Pasternak
foundation. The soil-pile interaction is formulated into a fourth-order
ordinary differential equation (ODE) that constitutes the physics-informed
component, while measured data are incorporated into PIELM as the data-driven
component. Combining physics and data yields a loss vector of the extreme
learning machine (ELM) network, which is trained within 1 second by the least
squares method. After validating the PIELM approach by the boundary element
method (BEM) and finite difference method (FDM), parametric studies are carried
out to examine the effects of ELM network architecture, data monitoring
locations and numbers on the performance of PIELM. The results indicate that
monitored data should be placed at positions where the gradients of pile
deflections are significant, such as at the pile tip/top and near tunneling
zones. Two application examples highlight the critical role of physics-informed
and data-driven approach for tunnelling-induced soil-pile interactions. The
proposed approach shows great potential for real-time monitoring and safety
assessment of pile foundations, and benefits for intelligent early-warning
systems in geotechnical engineering.

Abstract: We present DexBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate large language
model (LLM) performance across real-world decision-making tasks faced by
individuals managing diabetes in their daily lives. Unlike prior health
benchmarks that are either generic, clinician-facing or focused on clinical
tasks (e.g., diagnosis, triage), DexBench introduces a comprehensive evaluation
framework tailored to the unique challenges of prototyping patient-facing AI
solutions in diabetes, glucose management, metabolic health and related
domains. Our benchmark encompasses 7 distinct task categories, reflecting the
breadth of real-world questions individuals with diabetes ask, including basic
glucose interpretation, educational queries, behavioral associations, advanced
decision making and long term planning. Towards this end, we compile a rich
dataset comprising one month of time-series data encompassing glucose traces
and metrics from continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and behavioral logs (e.g.,
eating and activity patterns) from 15,000 individuals across three different
diabetes populations (type 1, type 2, pre-diabetes/general health and
wellness). Using this data, we generate a total of 360,600 personalized,
contextual questions across the 7 tasks. We evaluate model performance on these
tasks across 5 metrics: accuracy, groundedness, safety, clarity and
actionability. Our analysis of 8 recent LLMs reveals substantial variability
across tasks and metrics; no single model consistently outperforms others
across all dimensions. By establishing this benchmark, we aim to advance the
reliability, safety, effectiveness and practical utility of AI solutions in
diabetes care.

Motivation: 现实世界中的机器学习问题常涉及层次结构数据，但传统欧几里得度量无法捕捉离散的分支性质，需要更适合层次关系的度量方法。

Method: 建立p-adic度量空间的机器学习理论基础，证明p-adic回归的关键性质定理及其推论。

Conclusion: p-adic度量可能是正确处理机器学习中层次数据结构的基础方法，在层次数据中选择实际观测点比插值更有意义。

Abstract: Many real-world machine learning problems involve inherently hierarchical
data, yet traditional approaches rely on Euclidean metrics that fail to capture
the discrete, branching nature of hierarchical relationships. We present a
theoretical foundation for machine learning in p-adic metric spaces, which
naturally respect hierarchical structure. Our main result proves that an
n-dimensional plane minimizing the p-adic sum of distances to points in a
dataset must pass through at least n + 1 of those points -- a striking contrast
to Euclidean regression that highlights how p-adic metrics better align with
the discrete nature of hierarchical data. As a corollary, a polynomial of
degree n constructed to minimise the p-adic sum of residuals will pass through
at least n + 1 points. As a further corollary, a polynomial of degree n
approximating a higher degree polynomial at a finite number of points will
yield a difference polynomial that has distinct rational roots. We demonstrate
the practical significance of this result through two applications in natural
language processing: analyzing hierarchical taxonomies and modeling grammatical
morphology. These results suggest that p-adic metrics may be fundamental to
properly handling hierarchical data structures in machine learning. In
hierarchical data, interpolation between points often makes less sense than
selecting actual observed points as representatives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNN作为机器学习模型具有潜在能效优势，但脉冲机制的非可微性和稀疏性使其难以通过梯度传播算法训练。需要解决SNN训练困难的问题。

Method: 将随机特征方法从ANN适配到脉冲响应模型SNN，提出S-SWIM算法，这是一种数据驱动、快速、高性能且可解释的端到端SNN训练方法。

Result: S-SWIM在时间序列预测中能达到高精度，作为独立策略表现良好，且作为梯度训练前的初始化策略效果显著，优于随机权重采样。

Conclusion: S-SWIM为SNN训练提供了一种有效的替代方案，无需梯度近似，在性能和效率方面都有优势，可作为梯度训练的补充或替代方法。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) as Machine Learning (ML) models have recently
received a lot of attention as a potentially more energy-efficient alternative
to conventional Artificial Neural Networks. The non-differentiability and
sparsity of the spiking mechanism can make these models very difficult to train
with algorithms based on propagating gradients through the spiking
non-linearity. We address this problem by adapting the paradigm of Random
Feature Methods (RFMs) from Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to Spike Response
Model (SRM) SNNs. This approach allows training of SNNs without approximation
of the spike function gradient. Concretely, we propose a novel data-driven,
fast, high-performance, and interpretable algorithm for end-to-end training of
SNNs inspired by the SWIM algorithm for RFM-ANNs, which we coin S-SWIM. We
provide a thorough theoretical discussion and supplementary numerical
experiments showing that S-SWIM can reach high accuracies on time series
forecasting as a standalone strategy and serve as an effective initialisation
strategy before gradient-based training. Additional ablation studies show that
our proposed method performs better than random sampling of network weights.

Conclusion: FedLLM-Align为异构环境下的联邦学习提供了一个鲁棒、隐私保护且通信高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing
raw data, making it attractive for privacy-sensitive domains such as
healthcare, finance, and IoT. A major obstacle, however, is the heterogeneity
of tabular data across clients, where divergent schemas and incompatible
feature spaces prevent straightforward aggregation. To address this challenge,
we propose FedLLM-Align, a federated framework that leverages pre-trained large
language models (LLMs) as universal feature extractors. Tabular records are
serialized into text, and embeddings from models such as DistilBERT, ALBERT,
RoBERTa, and ClinicalBERT provide semantically aligned representations that
support lightweight local classifiers under the standard FedAvg protocol. This
approach removes the need for manual schema harmonization while preserving
privacy, since raw data remain strictly local. We evaluate FedLLM-Align on
coronary heart disease prediction using partitioned Framingham datasets with
simulated schema divergence. Across all client settings and LLM backbones, our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to
+0.25 improvement in F1-score and a 65% reduction in communication cost. Stress
testing under extreme schema divergence further demonstrates graceful
degradation, unlike traditional methods that collapse entirely. These results
establish FedLLM-Align as a robust, privacy-preserving, and
communication-efficient solution for federated learning in heterogeneous
environments.

Abstract: Foundation models have reshaped AI by unifying fragmented architectures into
scalable backbones with multimodal reasoning and contextual adaptation. In
parallel, the long-standing notion of AI agents, defined by the
sensing-decision-action loop, is entering a new paradigm: with FMs as their
cognitive core, agents transcend rule-based behaviors to achieve autonomy,
generalization, and self-reflection. This dual shift is reinforced by
real-world demands such as autonomous driving, robotics, virtual assistants,
and GUI agents, as well as ecosystem advances in embedded hardware, edge
computing, mobile deployment platforms, and communication protocols that
together enable large-scale deployment. Yet this convergence collides with
reality: while applications demand long-term adaptability and real-time
interaction, mobile and edge deployments remain constrained by memory, energy,
bandwidth, and latency. This creates a fundamental tension between the growing
complexity of FMs and the limited resources of deployment environments. This
survey provides the first systematic characterization of adaptive,
resource-efficient agentic AI systems. We summarize enabling techniques into
elastic inference, test-time adaptation, dynamic multimodal integration, and
agentic AI applications, and identify open challenges in balancing
accuracy-latency-communication trade-offs and sustaining robustness under
distribution shifts. We further highlight future opportunities in
algorithm-system co-design, cognitive adaptation, and collaborative edge
deployment. By mapping FM structures, cognition, and hardware resources, this
work establishes a unified perspective toward scalable, adaptive, and
resource-efficient agentic AI. We believe this survey can help readers to
understand the connections between enabling technologies while promoting
further discussions on the fusion of agentic intelligence and intelligent
agents.

Abstract: Federated inference, in the form of one-shot federated learning, edge
ensembles, or federated ensembles, has emerged as an attractive solution to
combine predictions from multiple models. This paradigm enables each model to
remain local and proprietary while a central server queries them and aggregates
predictions. Yet, the robustness of federated inference has been largely
neglected, leaving them vulnerable to even simple attacks. To address this
critical gap, we formalize the problem of robust federated inference and
provide the first robustness analysis of this class of methods. Our analysis of
averaging-based aggregators shows that the error of the aggregator is small
either when the dissimilarity between honest responses is small or the margin
between the two most probable classes is large. Moving beyond linear averaging,
we show that problem of robust federated inference with non-linear aggregators
can be cast as an adversarial machine learning problem. We then introduce an
advanced technique using the DeepSet aggregation model, proposing a novel
composition of adversarial training and test-time robust aggregation to
robustify non-linear aggregators. Our composition yields significant
improvements, surpassing existing robust aggregation methods by 4.7 - 22.2% in
accuracy points across diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: 近似单峰似然模型能够更好地适应真实世界序数数据的分布特性，在保持单峰模型优势的同时缓解其对非单峰分布的偏差。

Abstract: Ordinal regression (OR, also called ordinal classification) is classification
of ordinal data, in which the underlying target variable is categorical and
considered to have a natural ordinal relation for the underlying explanatory
variable. A key to successful OR models is to find a data structure `natural
ordinal relation' common to many ordinal data and reflect that structure into
the design of those models. A recent OR study found that many real-world
ordinal data show a tendency that the conditional probability distribution
(CPD) of the target variable given a value of the explanatory variable will
often be unimodal. Several previous studies thus developed unimodal likelihood
models, in which a predicted CPD is guaranteed to become unimodal. However, it
was also observed experimentally that many real-world ordinal data partly have
values of the explanatory variable where the underlying CPD will be
non-unimodal, and hence unimodal likelihood models may suffer from a bias for
such a CPD. Therefore, motivated to mitigate such a bias, we propose
approximately unimodal likelihood models, which can represent up to a unimodal
CPD and a CPD that is close to be unimodal. We also verify experimentally that
a proposed model can be effective for statistical modeling of ordinal data and
OR tasks.

Motivation: 现有决策预训练变换器(DPTs)在超出预训练数据分布时泛化能力不足，需要探索缓解这一限制的方法。

Method: 提出上下文好奇心正则化器，在PPT框架中为DPT添加辅助奖励预测器，使用预测误差作为内在好奇心信号，在训练中鼓励更广泛的探索。

Result: 在高斯多臂老虎机的概念验证实验中，PPT显示出更好的鲁棒性：当测试环境奖励方差较高时，PPT能够缓解DPT观察到的性能下降，特别是在预训练数据多样性有限的情况下。

Conclusion: 虽然离线数据质量仍然是基础，但初步结果表明好奇心驱动的预训练为增强上下文强化学习智能体的分布外泛化能力提供了一个有前景的方向。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in capability, there is
increasing interest in incorporating them into decision-making tasks. A common
pipeline for this is Decision-Pretrained Transformers (DPTs). However, existing
training methods for DPTs often struggle to generalize beyond their pretraining
data distribution. To explore mitigation of this limitation, we propose
in-context curiosity -- a lightweight, exploration-inspired regularizer for
offline pretraining -- and introduce the Prediction-Powered Transformer (PPT)
framework. PPT augments DPT with an auxiliary reward predictor, using
prediction error as an intrinsic curiosity signal to encourage broader
exploration during training. In proof-of-concept experiments on Gaussian
multi-armed bandits, PPT shows improved robustness: it moderates the
performance degradation observed in DPT when test environments exhibit higher
variance in reward, particularly when pretraining data has limited diversity.
While the quality of offline data remain fundamental, our preliminary results
suggest that curiosity-driven pretraining offers a promising direction for
enhancing out-of-distribution generalization in in-context RL agents.

Abstract: We introduce BigBang-Proton, a unified sequence-based architecture for
auto-regressive language modeling pretrained on cross-scale, cross-structure,
cross-discipline real-world scientific tasks to construct a scientific
multi-task learner. BigBang-Proton incorporates three fundamental innovations
compared to mainstream general-purpose LLMs: Theory-Experiment Learning
paradigm aligns large-scale numerical experimental data with theoretical text
corpora; Binary Patch Encoding replaces byte pair encoding(BPE) tokenization;
Monte Carlo Attention substitutes traditional transformer architectures.
Through next-word-prediction pretraining on cross-discipline scientific
datasets of real-world problems mixed with general textual corpus, followed by
fine-tuning and inference on downstream tasks, BigBang-Proton demonstrates
100\% accuracy in up to 50-digit arithmetic addition operations, performance on
par with leading specialized models in particle physics jet tagging, matching
MAE of specialized models in inter-atomic potential simulation, performance
comparable to traditional spatiotemporal models in water quality prediction,
and benchmark-exceeding performance in genome modeling. These results prove
that language-guided scientific computing can match or exceed the performance
of task-specific scientific models while maintaining multitask learning
capabilities. We further hypothesize to scale the pretraining to the universe
scale as a fundamental step toward developing material world foundational
model.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统transformer模型在训练和部署时面临计算复杂度高、能耗大的挑战，特别是输入序列长度与计算复杂度呈二次关系。现有SNN转换方法存在效率低、延迟高的问题。

Method: 1) 用脉冲自注意力(SSA)替换自注意力机制；2) 将训练好的transformer模型的feed-forward块转换为等效SNN；3) 使用SNN代理学习算法微调SSA块。

Result: 在GPT-2小模型上测试，转换后模型在余弦相似度上损失5-12%，困惑度降低9.7%。SSA块相比ASA块在数字硬件上实现自注意力机制时，能耗降低64.71%-85.28%。

Conclusion: NeurTransformer方法能够有效将transformer模型转换为SNN，在保持性能的同时显著降低能耗，具有很好的可扩展性。

Abstract: Foundational models based on the transformer architecture are currently the
state-of-the-art in general language modeling, as well as in scientific areas
such as material science and climate. However, training and deploying these
models is computationally challenging as the time and space complexity has a
quadratic relation to the input sequence length. Several efforts exploring
efficient computational paradigms and model architectures to address these
limitations have been made. In this work, we explore spiking neural networks
(SNNs) to design transformer models. A challenge in training large-scale SNNs,
using existing surrogate learning methods is inefficient and time-consuming. On
the other hand, techniques to convert existing transformer-based models to
their SNN equivalent are not scalable, as achieving optimal performance comes
at the cost of a large number of spike time-steps, i.e. increased latency. To
address this, we propose NeurTransformer, a methodology for designing
transformer-based SNN for inference using a supervised fine-tuning approach
with existing conversion methods. The proposed methodology works by: (1)
replacing the self-attention mechanism with a spike-based self-attention (SSA),
(2) converting the feed-forward block of the trained transformer model to its
equivalent SNN, and (3) fine-tuning the SSA block using SNN-based surrogate
learning algorithms. We benchmark the proposed methodology and demonstrate its
accuracy and scalability using three variants of the GPT-2 model of increasing
model size. We observe that the converted GPT-2 small models demonstrate a
5-12% loss in cosine similarity and a 9.7% reduction in perplexity. Finally, we
demonstrate the energy efficiency of the SSA block compared to the ASA block
and show between 64.71% and 85.28% reductions in estimated energy consumption
when implementing the self-attention mechanism on a digital hardware.

Conclusion: 比较机制是概念学习的关键，提出的理论框架为概念识别提供了通用理论基础，扩展了概念学习的适用范围。

Abstract: We are born with the ability to learn concepts by comparing diverse
observations. This helps us to understand the new world in a compositional
manner and facilitates extrapolation, as objects naturally consist of multiple
concepts. In this work, we argue that the cognitive mechanism of comparison,
fundamental to human learning, is also vital for machines to recover true
concepts underlying the data. This offers correctness guarantees for the field
of concept learning, which, despite its impressive empirical successes, still
lacks general theoretical support. Specifically, we aim to develop a
theoretical framework for the identifiability of concepts with multiple classes
of observations. We show that with sufficient diversity across classes, hidden
concepts can be identified without assuming specific concept types, functional
relations, or parametric generative models. Interestingly, even when conditions
are not globally satisfied, we can still provide alternative guarantees for as
many concepts as possible based on local comparisons, thereby extending the
applicability of our theory to more flexible scenarios. Moreover, the hidden
structure between classes and concepts can also be identified
nonparametrically. We validate our theoretical results in both synthetic and
real-world settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在实际应用中，获取大量奖励标签通常不可行，特别是在依赖人类反馈时。当强化学习只能在有限反馈下进行时，需要确定哪些样本应该被标注以最大化策略性能。

Method: 研究了两种选择策略：(i) 基于无奖励信息的启发式方法，如状态访问和部分价值函数；(ii) 使用辅助评估反馈预训练的策略。

Result: 发现关键的奖励子集是那些能够引导智能体沿最优轨迹前进，并在偏离后支持恢复接近最优行为的奖励。有效的选择方法能用比完全监督少得多的奖励标签获得接近最优的策略。

Conclusion: 奖励选择是在反馈受限环境中扩展强化学习的有力范式，能显著减少所需的奖励标签数量。

Abstract: The ability of reinforcement learning algorithms to learn effective policies
is determined by the rewards available during training. However, for practical
problems, obtaining large quantities of reward labels is often infeasible due
to computational or financial constraints, particularly when relying on human
feedback. When reinforcement learning must proceed with limited feedback --
only a fraction of samples get rewards labeled -- a fundamental question
arises: which samples should be labeled to maximize policy performance? We
formalize this problem of reward selection for reinforcement learning from
limited feedback (RLLF), introducing a new problem formulation that facilitates
the study of strategies for selecting impactful rewards. Two types of selection
strategies are investigated: (i) heuristics that rely on reward-free
information such as state visitation and partial value functions, and (ii)
strategies pre-trained using auxiliary evaluative feedback. We find that
critical subsets of rewards are those that (1) guide the agent along optimal
trajectories, and (2) support recovery toward near-optimal behavior after
deviations. Effective selection methods yield near-optimal policies with
significantly fewer reward labels than full supervision, establishing reward
selection as a powerful paradigm for scaling reinforcement learning in
feedback-limited settings.

Motivation: AI决策系统在关键领域广泛应用引发了对算法公平性的担忧。由于通常只能访问算法输出而无法了解其内部机制，研究反事实公平性度量变得重要，但如何从可用数据评估这些度量仍具挑战性。

Method: 采用部分识别方法，从观测数据中推导反事实公平性度量的信息边界，并引入贝叶斯方法以高置信度约束未知的反事实公平性度量。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效评估不可识别的反事实公平性度量，为算法公平性评估提供了实用工具，特别是在目标反事实度量不可识别的情况下。

Abstract: The wide adoption of AI decision-making systems in critical domains such as
criminal justice, loan approval, and hiring processes has heightened concerns
about algorithmic fairness. As we often only have access to the output of
algorithms without insights into their internal mechanisms, it was natural to
examine how decisions would alter when auxiliary sensitive attributes (such as
race) change. This led the research community to come up with counterfactual
fairness measures, but how to evaluate the measure from available data remains
a challenging task. In many practical applications, the target counterfactual
measure is not identifiable, i.e., it cannot be uniquely determined from the
combination of quantitative data and qualitative knowledge. This paper
addresses this challenge using partial identification, which derives
informative bounds over counterfactual fairness measures from observational
data. We introduce a Bayesian approach to bound unknown counterfactual fairness
measures with high confidence. We demonstrate our algorithm on the COMPAS
dataset, examining fairness in recidivism risk scores with respect to race,
age, and sex. Our results reveal a positive (spurious) effect on the COMPAS
score when changing race to African-American (from all others) and a negative
(direct causal) effect when transitioning from young to old age.

Abstract: Language models are increasingly capable, yet still fail at a seemingly
simple task of multi-digit multiplication. In this work, we study why, by
reverse-engineering a model that successfully learns multiplication via
\emph{implicit chain-of-thought}, and report three findings: (1) Evidence of
long-range structure: Logit attributions and linear probes indicate that the
model encodes the necessary long-range dependencies for multi-digit
multiplication. (2) Mechanism: the model encodes long-range dependencies using
attention to construct a directed acyclic graph to ``cache'' and ``retrieve''
pairwise partial products. (3) Geometry: the model implements partial products
in attention heads by forming Minkowski sums between pairs of digits, and
digits are represented using a Fourier basis, both of which are intuitive and
efficient representations that the standard fine-tuning model lacks. With these
insights, we revisit the learning dynamics of standard fine-tuning and find
that the model converges to a local optimum that lacks the required long-range
dependencies. We further validate this understanding by introducing an
auxiliary loss that predicts the ``running sum'' via a linear regression probe,
which provides an inductive bias that enables the model to successfully learn
multi-digit multiplication. In summary, by reverse-engineering the mechanisms
of an implicit chain-of-thought model we uncover a pitfall for learning
long-range dependencies in Transformers and provide an example of how the
correct inductive bias can address this issue.

Motivation: LoRA的参数高效微调方法在表示能力上往往落后于完全微调，关键问题是如何从过参数化空间中获得表达能力强的低秩适配器。

Method: 使用结构化剪枝方法，通过最小化整体损失的剪枝误差，在基于梯度的剪枝策略中提供细粒度的剪枝和恢复更新，并提供了结构化剪枝鲁棒性的理论分析。

Conclusion: PrunedLoRA通过动态结构化剪枝有效提升了低秩适配器的表示能力，在多个任务中表现出色，并提供了剪枝鲁棒性的理论保证。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a widely used paradigm for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models, yet its
representational capacity often lags behind full fine-tuning. Within the
context of LoRA, a key open question is how to obtain expressive low-rank
adapters from over-parameterized spaces. We propose \textit{PrunedLoRA}, a new
framework that leverages structured pruning to obtain highly representative
low-rank adapters from an over-parameterized initialization. Unlike prior
approaches that impose a fixed low-rank budget, PrunedLoRA dynamically prunes
less important components during fine-tuning and prevents their reactivation,
enabling flexible and adaptive rank allocation. For structured pruning, by
minimizing the pruning error for overall loss, we provide fine-grained pruning
and recovery updates in a gradient-based pruning strategy with grounded
interpretation. We provide the first theoretical analysis of the robustness of
structured pruning and provably show that under the impact of weight
perturbation, gradient-based pruning is more robust than activation-based
pruning with respect to overall loss. Empirically, PrunedLoRA consistently
outperforms LoRA and its variants across supervised fine-tuning tasks in
mathematical reasoning, code generation, and natural language understanding,
and it also demonstrates advantages over existing structured pruning methods
across diverse sparsity levels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GRPO方法缺乏明确的奖励或评论家模型，无法在token序列上进行细粒度的信用分配，限制了推理能力的进一步提升。

Method: 使用token级对数概率重新表述资格迹，引入无评论家的时序差分误差近似，提出了几种λ-return加权变体。

Conclusion: GRPO-λ通过改进信用分配机制，显著提升了LLM在复杂推理任务中的RL训练效果和最终性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for tasks requiring
complex reasoning, prompting significant interest in improving their reasoning
abilities through post-training. Especially RL based methods using verifiable
reward, like the state-of-the-art GRPO, have shown to tremendously improve
reasoning behaviors when applied as post-training methods. However, the lack of
an explicit reward or critic model limits GRPO's ability to assign fine-grained
credit across token sequences. In this work, we present GRPO-$\lambda$, a novel
extension to GRPO that enhances credit assignment in RL finetuning of LLMs for
complex reasoning tasks. We approximate learning from $\lambda$-return with a
reformulation of eligibility traces using token-level log-probabilities applied
after each sequence generation, and a novel critic-free approximation of the
temporal-difference error. We introduce a few variations for the weighting of
the $\lambda$-return, and their applications to the eligibility-trace, where
all the variations provide significant gains over GRPO. We compare
GRPO-$\lambda$ against GRPO by training models from 1.5B to 7B parameters on
$4$ different math reasoning datasets. The training plots demonstrate 30-40%
improved performance during RL training on both LLaMA-3.1 and Qwen-2.5
architectures. Finally, we show that with GRPO-$\lambda$, the resulting average
performance on AIME24, Math500, OlympiadMath, MinervaMath, and AMC improves
over GRPO by over $3$ points and a $4.5$ points improvement on the 7B model.

Motivation: 当前LLM生态系统中的路由器种类繁多，选择合适的路由器变得越来越困难，需要类似模型排行榜的标准比较平台。

Method: 构建RouterArena平台，包含四个核心组件：精心构建的数据集、可区分难度级别的知识领域、广泛的评估指标和自动化排行榜更新框架。

Result: 建立了首个LLM路由器比较平台，生成了包含详细指标比较的初始排行榜，如图1所示。

Conclusion: RouterArena解决了LLM路由器选择困难的问题，为社区提供了标准化的比较平台，并将很快向公众开放。

Abstract: Today's LLM ecosystem comprises a wide spectrum of models that differ in
size, capability, and cost. No single model is optimal for all scenarios;
hence, LLM routers have become essential for selecting the most appropriate
model under varying circumstances. However, the rapid emergence of various
routers makes choosing the right one increasingly challenging. To address this
problem, we need a comprehensive router comparison and a standardized
leaderboard, similar to those available for models. In this work, we introduce
RouterArena, the first open platform enabling comprehensive comparison of LLM
routers. RouterArena has (1) a principally constructed dataset with broad
knowledge domain coverage, (2) distinguishable difficulty levels for each
domain, (3) an extensive list of evaluation metrics, and (4) an automated
framework for leaderboard updates. Leveraging our framework, we have produced
the initial leaderboard with detailed metrics comparison as shown in Figure 1.
We will make our platform open to the public soon.

### [203] [LoRAFusion: Efficient LoRA Fine-Tuning for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00206)
*Zhanda Zhu,Qidong Su,Yaoyao Ding,Kevin Song,Shang Wang,Gennady Pekhimenko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoRAFusion是一个高效的LoRA微调系统，通过图分割融合内存绑定操作和自适应批处理算法，解决了现有LoRA系统的内存访问冗余和多适配器并发微调问题，实现了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LoRA微调系统存在两个关键低效问题：1）由于对大激活张量的冗余内存访问导致运行时开销；2）无法在同一GPU上并发微调多个共享基础模型的独立LoRA适配器，错失了减少流水线气泡、改善通信重叠和GPU负载均衡的机会。

Method: LoRAFusion在核级别提出图分割方法融合内存绑定操作，消除不必要的内存访问；在调度级别引入自适应批处理算法，将LoRA适配器分组以错开批处理执行，并在组内解决装箱问题生成平衡的、依赖感知的微批次。

Result: 与Megatron-LM相比，LoRAFusion实现了最高1.96倍（平均1.47倍）的端到端加速；与最先进的多LoRA微调系统mLoRA相比，实现了最高1.46倍（平均1.29倍）的改进。融合核实现了最高1.39倍（平均1.27倍）的核性能提升。

Conclusion: LoRAFusion通过核级和调度级的优化设计，显著提升了LoRA微调的效率和性能，可作为现有LoRA系统的即插即用替代方案，并已开源。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become the leading Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method for Large Language Models (LLMs), as it significantly
reduces GPU memory usage while maintaining competitive fine-tuned model quality
on downstream tasks. Despite these benefits, we identify two key inefficiencies
in existing LoRA fine-tuning systems. First, they incur substantial runtime
overhead due to redundant memory accesses on large activation tensors. Second,
they miss the opportunity to concurrently fine-tune multiple independent LoRA
adapters that share the same base model on the same set of GPUs. This leads to
missed performance gains such as reduced pipeline bubbles, better communication
overlap, and improved GPU load balance.
  To address these issues, we introduce LoRAFusion, an efficient LoRA
fine-tuning system for LLMs. At the kernel level, we propose a graph-splitting
method that fuses memory-bound operations. This design eliminates unnecessary
memory accesses and preserves the performance of compute-bound GEMMs without
incurring the cost of recomputation or synchronization. At the scheduling
level, LoRAFusion introduces an adaptive batching algorithm for multi-job
fine-tuning. It first splits LoRA adapters into groups to intentionally stagger
batch execution across jobs, and then solves a bin-packing problem within each
group to generate balanced, dependency-aware microbatches. LoRAFusion achieves
up to $1.96\times$ ($1.47\times$ on average) end-to-end speedup compared to
Megatron-LM, and up to $1.46\times$ ($1.29\times$ on average) improvement over
mLoRA, the state-of-the-art multi-LoRA fine-tuning system. Our fused kernel
achieves up to $1.39\times$ ($1.27\times$ on average) kernel performance
improvement and can directly serve as a plug-and-play replacement in existing
LoRA systems. We open-source LoRAFusion at
https://github.com/CentML/lorafusion.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Directed-MAML算法，通过任务导向的一阶近似来估计二阶梯度效应，解决了MAML在元强化学习中计算开销大和收敛困难的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MAML在元强化学习中面临两个主要挑战：二阶梯度计算带来显著的计算和内存开销，以及嵌套优化结构增加了问题复杂度，使全局最优收敛更加困难。

Method: 在二阶梯度步骤之前，应用额外的任务导向一阶近似来估计二阶梯度的影响，从而加速收敛并降低计算成本。该方法还可集成到其他元学习算法如FOMAML和Meta-SGD中。

Result: 实验结果表明，在CartPole-v1、LunarLander-v2和两车交叉路口场景中，Directed-MAML在计算效率和收敛速度方面优于基于MAML的基线方法。

Conclusion: 任务导向近似方法能有效提升元强化学习算法的性能，不仅适用于MAML，还可扩展到其他元学习算法，显著改善计算效率和收敛速度。

Abstract: Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) is a versatile meta-learning framework
applicable to both supervised learning and reinforcement learning (RL).
However, applying MAML to meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) presents
notable challenges. First, MAML relies on second-order gradient computations,
leading to significant computational and memory overhead. Second, the nested
structure of optimization increases the problem's complexity, making
convergence to a global optimum more challenging. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Directed-MAML, a novel task-directed meta-RL algorithm.
Before the second-order gradient step, Directed-MAML applies an additional
first-order task-directed approximation to estimate the effect of second-order
gradients, thereby accelerating convergence to the optimum and reducing
computational cost. Experimental results demonstrate that Directed-MAML
surpasses MAML-based baselines in computational efficiency and convergence
speed in the scenarios of CartPole-v1, LunarLander-v2 and two-vehicle
intersection crossing. Furthermore, we show that task-directed approximation
can be effectively integrated into other meta-learning algorithms, such as
First-Order Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (FOMAML) and Meta Stochastic Gradient
Descent(Meta-SGD), yielding improved computational efficiency and convergence
speed.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 验证了一种贝叶斯双轴主动分类方法，用于工作记忆重建任务，通过高斯过程分类器控制空间负载和特征绑定负载，与传统自适应阶梯方法相比具有同等效果但能更快收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统认知实验通常只控制单一因素并用标量总结性能，需要开发能同时控制多个因素并揭示个体差异的更先进实验设计方法。

Method: 使用贝叶斯非参数高斯过程概率分类器，在工作记忆重建任务中同时控制空间负载(L)和特征绑定负载(K)，通过后验不确定性指导刺激获取。

Result: 与传统自适应阶梯方法在K=3时具有同等效果(组内相关系数0.755)，但能更快收敛(约30个样本即可准确拟合完整模型)，并揭示了空间负载与特征绑定之间的个体差异。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯双轴主动分类方法为认知实验设计提供了更高效和全面的替代方案，能够同时探索多个因素并捕捉个体差异。

Abstract: While adaptive experimental design has outgrown one-dimensional,
staircase-based adaptations, most cognitive experiments still control a single
factor and summarize performance with a scalar. We show a validation of a
Bayesian, two-axis, active-classification approach, carried out in an immersive
virtual testing environment for a 5-by-5 working-memory reconstruction task.
Two variables are controlled: spatial load L (number of occupied tiles) and
feature-binding load K (number of distinct colors) of items. Stimulus
acquisition is guided by posterior uncertainty of a nonparametric Gaussian
Process (GP) probabilistic classifier, which outputs a surface over (L, K)
rather than a single threshold or max span value. In a young adult population,
we compare GP-driven Adaptive Mode (AM) with a traditional adaptive staircase
Classic Mode (CM), which varies L only at K = 3. Parity between the methods is
achieved for this cohort, with an intraclass coefficient of 0.755 at K = 3.
Additionally, AM reveals individual differences in interactions between spatial
load and feature binding. AM estimates converge more quickly than other
sampling strategies, demonstrating that only about 30 samples are required for
accurate fitting of the full model.

TL;DR: KV缓存压缩虽然能提高吞吐量，但在多指令提示等实际场景中可能导致某些指令被完全忽略，特别是系统提示泄露问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究KV缓存压缩在实际部署中的潜在问题，特别是多指令提示场景下的性能下降和指令忽略现象。

Method: 分析不同压缩方法、指令顺序和KV驱逐偏差对提示泄露的影响，并提出改进的KV缓存驱逐策略。

Result: 发现某些指令在压缩后性能急剧下降，系统提示泄露问题严重，且受压缩方法、指令顺序和驱逐偏差影响。

Conclusion: KV缓存压缩需要谨慎部署，提出的驱逐策略改进可以减轻多指令任务中的负面影响。

Abstract: KV cache compression promises increased throughput and efficiency with
negligible loss in performance. While the gains in throughput are indisputable
and recent literature has indeed shown minimal degradation on particular
benchmarks, in general the consequences of compression in realistic scenarios
such as multi-instruction prompting have been insufficiently studied. In this
paper, we identify several pitfalls practitioners should be aware of when
deploying KV cache compressed LLMs. Importantly, we show that certain
instructions degrade much more rapidly with compression, effectively causing
them to be completely ignored by the LLM. As a practical example of that, we
highlight system prompt leakage as a case study, empirically showing the impact
of compression on leakage and general instruction following. We show several
factors that play a role in prompt leakage: compression method, instruction
order, and KV eviction bias. We then propose simple changes to KV cache
eviction policies that can reduce the impact of these factors and improve the
overall performance in multi-instruction tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于可视化诊断的系统方法来评估和改进区域供热网络中的数据质量，通过交互式仪表板实现人机协作的数据质量评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 区域供热网络中的传感器和计量数据存在噪声、缺失值和时间不一致等问题，这会显著降低AI模型的性能，因此需要有效的数据质量评估方法。

Method: 开发了基于Python的交互式仪表板，使用时序图、热力图、箱线图、直方图、相关矩阵和基于修正z分数的异常检测等可视化技术。

Result: 在丹麦区域供热提供商的真实数据集上验证，覆盖近7000个计量器超过4年的小时数据，可视化分析能够发现系统性数据问题。

Conclusion: 可视化分析为数据质量评估提供了可扩展的通用框架，强调了数据质量在AI驱动的能源管理系统中的关键作用。

Abstract: High-quality data is a prerequisite for training reliable Artificial
Intelligence (AI) models in the energy domain. In district heating networks,
sensor and metering data often suffer from noise, missing values, and temporal
inconsistencies, which can significantly degrade model performance. This paper
presents a systematic approach for evaluating and improving data quality using
visual diagnostics, implemented through an interactive web-based dashboard. The
dashboard employs Python-based visualization techniques, including time series
plots, heatmaps, box plots, histograms, correlation matrices, and
anomaly-sensitive KPIs such as skewness and anomaly detection based on the
modified z-scores. These tools al-low human experts to inspect and interpret
data anomalies, enabling a human-in-the-loop strategy for data quality
assessment. The methodology is demonstrated on a real-world dataset from a
Danish district heating provider, covering over four years of hourly data from
nearly 7000 meters. The findings show how visual analytics can uncover systemic
data issues and, in the future, guide data cleaning strategies that enhance the
accuracy, stability, and generalizability of Long Short-Term Memory and Gated
Recurrent Unit models for heat demand forecasting. The study contributes to a
scalable, generalizable framework for visual data inspection and underlines the
critical role of data quality in AI-driven energy management systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学机器学习虽然能从高维时空流数据中提取物理洞察，但在潜空间中实现可解释性仍然是一个挑战。

Method: 基于神经算子构建确定性自编码框架，通过编码神经算子进行空间粗化压缩到低维潜空间，再通过解码神经算子进行空间细化重建。在潜空间中集成可微PDE求解器，嵌入物理先验。

Result: 在2D圆柱绕流、2D对称狭窄动脉流和3D患者特异性冠状动脉流等基准问题上，DIANO展示了在支持维度和几何降维的潜空间中求解PDE的能力。

Conclusion: DIANO能够构建物理可解释的潜空间，同时实现维度和几何降维，并在潜空间中求解PDE，为科学机器学习提供了更可解释的框架。

Abstract: Scientific machine learning has enabled the extraction of physical insights
from high-dimensional spatiotemporal flow data using linear and nonlinear
dimensionality reduction techniques. Despite these advances, achieving
interpretability within the latent space remains a challenge. To address this,
we propose the DIfferentiable Autoencoding Neural Operator (DIANO), a
deterministic autoencoding neural operator framework that constructs physically
interpretable latent spaces for both dimensional and geometric reduction, with
the provision to enforce differential governing equations directly within the
latent space. Built upon neural operators, DIANO compresses high-dimensional
input functions into a low-dimensional latent space via spatial coarsening
through an encoding neural operator and subsequently reconstructs the original
inputs using a decoding neural operator through spatial refinement. We assess
DIANO's latent space interpretability and performance in dimensionality
reduction against baseline models, including the Convolutional Neural Operator
and standard autoencoders. Furthermore, a fully differentiable partial
differential equation (PDE) solver is developed and integrated within the
latent space, enabling the temporal advancement of both high- and low-fidelity
PDEs, thereby embedding physical priors into the latent dynamics. We further
investigate various PDE formulations, including the 2D unsteady
advection-diffusion and the 3D Pressure-Poisson equation, to examine their
influence on shaping the latent flow representations. Benchmark problems
considered include flow past a 2D cylinder, flow through a 2D symmetric
stenosed artery, and a 3D patient-specific coronary artery. These case studies
demonstrate DIANO's capability to solve PDEs within a latent space that
facilitates both dimensional and geometrical reduction while allowing latent
interpretability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了多步端口-哈密顿高斯过程(MS-PHS GP)，从噪声、不规则采样的轨迹中学习物理一致的连续时间动力学和哈密顿量的后验分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要从噪声、不规则采样的轨迹中学习物理一致的连续时间动力学，同时估计哈密顿量的不确定性。

Method: 在哈密顿量表面上放置高斯过程先验，将可变步长多步积分器约束编码为有限线性泛函，实现向量场和哈密顿量表面的闭式条件化。

Result: 在质量-弹簧、Van der Pol和Duffing基准测试中展示了改进的向量场恢复和良好校准的哈密顿量不确定性。

Conclusion: MS-PHS GP能够在不使用潜在状态的情况下学习物理一致的动力学，并提供了向量场估计和可变步长离散化误差的有限样本边界。

Abstract: We propose the multistep port-Hamiltonian Gaussian process (MS-PHS GP) to
learn physically consistent continuous-time dynamics and a posterior over the
Hamiltonian from noisy, irregularly-sampled trajectories. By placing a GP prior
on the Hamiltonian surface $H$ and encoding variable-step multistep integrator
constraints as finite linear functionals, MS-PHS GP enables closed-form
conditioning of both the vector field and the Hamiltonian surface without
latent states, while enforcing energy balance and passivity by design. We state
a finite-sample vector-field bound that separates the estimation and
variable-step discretization terms. Lastly, we demonstrate improved
vector-field recovery and well-calibrated Hamiltonian uncertainty on
mass-spring, Van der Pol, and Duffing benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文展示了在自动微分框架中高效计算梯度统计信息的方法，通过AD图手术和JAX向量化实现，重新审视了优化中的非线性操作，发现signSGD中符号操作位置和Adam预处理器中均值主导的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习训练算法将小批量样本视为单一对象，仅计算梯度平均值，但计算其他梯度统计信息被认为计算成本过高。本文旨在证明这并非事实，并探索基于逐样本梯度信息的新算法设计可能性。

Method: 通过自动微分图手术技术实现梯度统计计算，在某些情况下几乎不增加计算和内存开销；在transformer等模型中利用JAX的向量化变换进行实现；重新分析signSGD和Adam预处理器中的逐样本梯度变换。

Result: 发现signSGD中符号操作位置对成功至关重要，可通过信噪比预测；Adam预处理器中优化效果最好时预处理器由梯度分布的均值主导而非方差主导，与传统认知相反。

Conclusion: 逐样本梯度信息为算法设计开启了新的分析和可能性，证明了在自动微分框架中高效计算梯度统计信息的可行性。

Abstract: Training algorithms in deep learning usually treat a mini-batch of samples as
a single object; they average gradients over the mini-batch, and then process
the average in various ways. Computing other statistics beyond the average may
have been seen as prohibitively resource intensive in automatic differentiation
(AD) frameworks. We show that this is not the case. Generally, gradient
statistics can be implemented through a surgery of the AD graph, which, in some
cases, incur almost no computational and memory overheads compared to the
mini-batch gradient computation. Additionally, we show that in certain classes
of models, including transformers, JAX's vectorization transformation offers a
viable implementation for prototyping and experimentation. We then revise our
understanding of two nonlinear operations in optimization through the lens of
per-example gradient transformations. We first study signSGD and show that the
optimal placement of the sign operation in the gradient processing chain is
crucial to success and can be predicted with a simple signal-to-noise ratio
argument. Next we study per-example variations of the Adam preconditioner, and
show that optimization is best served when the preconditioner is dominated by
the mean rather than the variance of the gradient distribution - in contrast to
conventional wisdom. Overall we demonstrate that per-example gradient
information enables new analyses and possibilities for algorithm design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在推荐系统等实际应用中，多个学习智能体需要在保证安全约束的前提下平衡探索与利用，避免灾难性故障。需要研究分布式环境下的安全学习问题。

Method: 提出MA-SCLUCB算法，采用周期性交替执行动作选择和共识构建阶段。智能体仅与邻居通信，网络优化全局参数（局部参数的平均值）。

Result: 算法以高概率实现$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d}{\sqrt{N}}\sqrt{T}\cdot\frac{\log(NT)}{\sqrt{\log(1/|\lambda_2|)}}\right)$的遗憾上界，其中通信开销仅对数增长。

Conclusion: 分布式学习在合理连接的网络中能够实现接近最优的性能，协作带来$\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}$的改进，阶段安全约束仅增加低阶遗憾。

Abstract: In many real-world applications such as recommendation systems, multiple
learning agents must balance exploration and exploitation while maintaining
safety guarantees to avoid catastrophic failures. We study the stochastic
linear bandit problem in a multi-agent networked setting where agents must
satisfy stage-wise conservative constraints. A network of $N$ agents
collaboratively maximizes cumulative reward while ensuring that the expected
reward at every round is no less than $(1-\alpha)$ times that of a baseline
policy. Each agent observes local rewards with unknown parameters, but the
network optimizes for the global parameter (average of local parameters).
Agents communicate only with immediate neighbors, and each communication round
incurs additional regret. We propose MA-SCLUCB (Multi-Agent Stage-wise
Conservative Linear UCB), an episodic algorithm alternating between action
selection and consensus-building phases. We prove that MA-SCLUCB achieves
regret
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d}{\sqrt{N}}\sqrt{T}\cdot\frac{\log(NT)}{\sqrt{\log(1/|\lambda_2|)}}\right)$
with high probability, where $d$ is the dimension, $T$ is the horizon, and
$|\lambda_2|$ is the network's second largest eigenvalue magnitude. Our
analysis shows: (i) collaboration yields $\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}$ improvement
despite local communication, (ii) communication overhead grows only
logarithmically for well-connected networks, and (iii) stage-wise safety adds
only lower-order regret. Thus, distributed learning with safety guarantees
achieves near-optimal performance in reasonably connected networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文挑战了监督微调(SFT)无法泛化而强化学习(RL)具有更强泛化能力的传统观点，通过系统评估发现SFT的泛化问题主要源于固定提示模板，通过引入提示多样性和思维链监督，SFT可以达到与RL相当的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视SFT与RL在泛化能力上的对比，挑战SFT必然劣于RL的传统观点，探索通过数据策略提升SFT泛化能力的方法。

Method: 在Sokoban和General Points两个决策基准上进行系统评估，引入提示多样性训练和思维链监督作为算法支架，结合两种策略实现最优泛化。

Result: 提示多样性打破了训练语义依赖，显著提升对未见指令变体的泛化；思维链监督大幅改善对更难任务的迁移能力；两者结合在指令变体和难度变体设置中都达到最佳泛化性能，匹配或超越RL基线。

Conclusion: SFT并非天生劣于RL，通过适当的数据策略（提示多样性和思维链监督），SFT可以实现与RL相当的强泛化能力，支持数据中心的视角。

Abstract: A prevailing view holds that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) memorizes training
data and fails to generalize, whereas reinforcement learning (RL) attains
broader robustness. We revisit this claim through a systematic evaluation on
two decision-making benchmarks, Sokoban and General Points, and arrive at a
different conclusion. We show that much of SFT's perceived failure stems from
frozen-prompt artifacts: when trained on fixed instruction templates, SFT
models cling to training semantics rather than adapting to new ones.
Introducing prompt diversity during training breaks this shortcut and yields
strong generalization to unseen instruction variants without harming
in-distribution performance. Beyond instruction shifts, we ask whether SFT can
generalize to strictly harder tasks. Here, chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision
provides an algorithmic scaffold that markedly improves transfer to more
difficult regimes, such as larger Sokoban grids with additional boxes and
arithmetic with out-of-distribution values or five-card compositions that
increase combinatorial complexity. Finally, combining prompt diversity with CoT
achieves the best of both worlds: robust generalization across both
instruction-variant and difficulty-variant settings, matching or surpassing RL
baselines on our benchmarks while retaining SFT's simplicity and stability.
These findings challenge the narrative that SFT is inherently inferior to RL
and support a data-centric perspective: with appropriately curated
demonstrations, vanilla SFT can generalize as strongly as RL. Code reproducing
the results in the paper can be found at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显微镜技术产生大量复杂图像数据，需要发现更简单、可解释和简约的形式来揭示底层物理结构。VAE能构建低维表示，但其性能依赖于多个非短视的设计选择，通常通过试错和经验分析来优化。

Method: 使用压电力显微镜数据作为模型系统，研究基于奖励的策略来评估潜在空间表示。采用高斯混合模型(GMM)和贝叶斯高斯混合模型(BGMM)来近似潜在空间，构建奖励函数来估计模型效率。

Result: 分析表明，使用GMM和BGMM近似潜在空间为构建奖励函数提供了坚实基础，能够估计模型效率并指导寻找最优简约表示。

Conclusion: 基于GMM和BGMM的奖励函数策略能够实现VAE工作流程的自动化和无偏优化，为发现物理系统的简约表示提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Microscopy techniques generate vast amounts of complex image data that in
principle can be used to discover simpler, interpretable, and parsimonious
forms to reveal the underlying physical structures, such as elementary building
blocks in molecular systems or order parameters and phases in crystalline
materials. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) provide a powerful means of
constructing such low-dimensional representations, but their performance
heavily depends on multiple non-myopic design choices, which are often
optimized through trial-and-error and empirical analysis. To enable automated
and unbiased optimization of VAE workflows, we investigated reward-based
strategies for evaluating latent space representations. Using Piezoresponse
Force Microscopy data as a model system, we examined multiple policies and
reward functions that can serve as a foundation for automated optimization. Our
analysis shows that approximating the latent space with Gaussian Mixture Models
(GMM) and Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models (BGMM) provides a strong basis for
constructing reward functions capable of estimating model efficiency and
guiding the search for optimal parsimonious representations.

Method: 设计编码平滑模块，在训练和推理中处理数据的线性组合而非原始输入，作为正则化机制

Result: 在监督和无监督任务中均能持续改善泛化能力，并在基于梯度的对抗攻击中达到最先进的鲁棒性

Conclusion: 编码平滑模块是一种高效有效的正则化方法，可提升模型泛化能力和对抗鲁棒性

Abstract: We introduce the coded-smoothing module, which can be seamlessly integrated
into standard training pipelines, both supervised and unsupervised, to
regularize learning and improve generalization with minimal computational
overhead. In addition, it can be incorporated into the inference pipeline to
randomize the model and enhance robustness against adversarial perturbations.
The design of coded-smoothing is inspired by general coded computing, a
paradigm originally developed to mitigate straggler and adversarial failures in
distributed computing by processing linear combinations of the data rather than
the raw inputs. Building on this principle, we adapt coded computing to machine
learning by designing an efficient and effective regularization mechanism that
encourages smoother representations and more generalizable solutions. Extensive
experiments on both supervised and unsupervised tasks demonstrate that
coded-smoothing consistently improves generalization and achieves
state-of-the-art robustness against gradient-based adversarial attacks.

Motivation: 现有研究发现循环网络擅长状态跟踪但难以处理回忆任务，而Transformer擅长回忆但无法将状态跟踪能力扩展到更长的序列。受这两种架构互补优势的启发，研究者构建混合模型来评估是否能同时保留这两种能力。

Method: 构建集成循环和注意力组件的混合模型，并提出延迟注意力层训练的策略来缓解Transformer组件对捷径解决方案的依赖。

Result: 实验表明，延迟注意力层训练的方法显著改善了长度泛化性能，使混合模型在比训练序列长三倍的混合序列上达到接近完美的准确率（>90%）。

Conclusion: Transformer组件对捷径解决方案的依赖是混合模型长度泛化的主要障碍，而延迟注意力层训练是缓解这一问题的简单有效策略。

Abstract: We study length generalization in sequence models on a composite problem
involving both state tracking and associative recall. Prior work finds that
recurrent networks handle state tracking well but struggle with recall, whereas
Transformers excel at recall yet fail to extend state-tracking capabilities to
longer sequences. Motivated by the complementary strengths of these
architectures, we construct hybrid models integrating recurrent and
attention-based components, and train them on the combined task to evaluate
whether both capabilities can be preserved. Our results reveal that, in such
hybrids, the Transformer component tends to exploit shortcut solutions, leading
to poor length generalization. We identify this shortcut reliance as a key
obstacle and propose a simple yet effective training strategy -- delaying the
training of the attention layers -- that mitigates this effect and
significantly improves length generalization performance. Our experiments show
that this approach enables hybrid models to achieve near-perfect accuracy
($>90\%$) on hybrid sequences three times longer than those used during
training.

*Debottam Dutta,Chaitanya Amballa,Zhongweiyang Xu,Yu-Lin Wei,Romit Roy Choudhury*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于能量的变分潜在先验(EVaLP)方法，通过变分方法处理EBM的归一化常数，避免昂贵的MCMC采样，提高VAE生成样本的质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VAE生成模糊和不一致样本的问题，特别是"先验空洞"问题，即先验高概率区域在后验中概率低，导致生成质量差。

Method: 将先验建模为能量模型(EBM)，使用变分方法处理归一化常数，通过采样器网络近似变分形式，形成交替优化问题。

Result: 相比多个SOTA基线，在图像生成质量、减少先验空洞和采样效率方面均有改进。

Conclusion: EVaLP方法能够灵活匹配后验分布，同时保持快速采样能力，有效解决了VAE生成质量问题。

Abstract: Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) are known to generate blurry and
inconsistent samples. One reason for this is the "prior hole" problem. A prior
hole refers to regions that have high probability under the VAE's prior but low
probability under the VAE's posterior. This means that during data generation,
high probability samples from the prior could have low probability under the
posterior, resulting in poor quality data. Ideally, a prior needs to be
flexible enough to match the posterior while retaining the ability to generate
samples fast. Generative models continue to address this tradeoff. This paper
proposes to model the prior as an energy-based model (EBM). While EBMs are
known to offer the flexibility to match posteriors (and also improving the
ELBO), they are traditionally slow in sample generation due to their dependency
on MCMC methods. Our key idea is to bring a variational approach to tackle the
normalization constant in EBMs, thus bypassing the expensive MCMC approaches.
The variational form can be approximated with a sampler network, and we show
that such an approach to training priors can be formulated as an alternating
optimization problem. Moreover, the same sampler reduces to an implicit
variational prior during generation, providing efficient and fast sampling. We
compare our Energy-based Variational Latent Prior (EVaLP) method to multiple
SOTA baselines and show improvements in image generation quality, reduced prior
holes, and better sampling efficiency.

*Trung Hoang Le,Tran Cao Son,Huiping Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SLogic是一个新颖的知识图谱补全框架，通过为逻辑规则分配查询相关的动态置信度分数，利用查询头实体的局部子图上下文来评估规则重要性，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于逻辑规则的方法通常将规则视为通用的，为每个规则分配固定的置信度分数，忽略了查询特定的上下文。这种限制很显著，因为规则的重要性会因查询而异。

Method: 提出了SLogic框架，其核心是一个评分函数，利用查询头实体的中心子图来动态评估每个规则的重要性，为逻辑规则分配查询相关的分数。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，通过利用局部子图上下文，SLogic在知识图谱补全任务中持续优于最先进的基线方法，包括基于嵌入和基于规则的方法。

Conclusion: SLogic通过引入查询相关的规则评分机制，有效解决了传统逻辑规则方法忽略查询上下文的问题，为知识图谱补全提供了更准确和动态的推理能力。

Abstract: Logical rule-based methods offer an interpretable approach to knowledge graph
completion by capturing compositional relationships in the form of
human-readable inference rules. However, current approaches typically treat
logical rules as universal, assigning each rule a fixed confidence score that
ignores query-specific context. This is a significant limitation, as a rule's
importance can vary depending on the query. To address this, we introduce
SLogic (Subgraph-Informed Logical Rule learning), a novel framework that
assigns query-dependent scores to logical rules. The core of SLogic is a
scoring function that utilizes the subgraph centered on a query's head entity,
allowing the significance of each rule to be assessed dynamically. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets show that by leveraging local subgraph
context, SLogic consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including
both embedding-based and rule-based methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Freedave是一种针对扩散大语言模型的无损并行解码算法，通过候选生成和验证的流水线，在不引入额外模型前向调用的情况下，将推理吞吐量提升至2.8倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型由于双向注意力机制不兼容KV缓存，导致推理效率低于自回归模型。现有并行解码算法虽然能加速推理，但会造成性能下降。

Method: 提出Freedave算法，采用并行解码的候选生成和验证流水线，保证生成序列与静态采样相同，无需额外模型前向调用。

Result: 在数学推理任务上，DLLMs的吞吐量提升高达2.8倍，且没有性能损失。

Conclusion: Freedave成功解决了DLLMs推理效率低的问题，实现了无损的并行解码加速。

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have emerged as a new paradigm of
language modeling beyond autoregressive next-token prediction. Thanks to their
bidirectional attention mechanism, DLLMs are more capable of capturing the
connection of context, and thus show unique advantages in challenges like the
famous "reversal curse" or learning under data-constrained scenarios. However,
this bidirectional nature also brings an obstacle that DLLMs are not inherently
compatible with KV Cache, and consequently, the inference efficiency is not
competitive compared with autoregressive models. Taking advantage of their
inherent capability of multi-token prediction, existing parallel decoding
algorithms can speed up the DLLM inference, but at the cost of non-negligible
performance degradation. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Free
Draft-and-Verification (Freedave), a novel fast sampling algorithm tailored for
DLLMs that achieves lossless parallel decoding. Specifically, we propose a
pipeline of parallel-decoded candidate generation and verification, which is
guaranteed to reproduce the same sequence generated by static sampling, without
introducing extra model forward calls. By applying Freedave, the throughput of
DLLMs can be boosted up to $2.8\times$ without performance degradation on math
reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有探测分类器在孤立层-令牌对上操作且仅针对特定LLM，限制了其效果和跨LLM应用能力。

Method: 基于激活数据的自然序列结构，将完整激活张量视为图像，设计受Vision Transformer启发的ACT-ViT模型，支持多LLM同时训练。

Conclusion: ACT-ViT为LLM幻觉检测提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案，支持跨模型应用和部署。

Abstract: Detecting hallucinations in Large Language Model-generated text is crucial
for their safe deployment. While probing classifiers show promise, they operate
on isolated layer-token pairs and are LLM-specific, limiting their
effectiveness and hindering cross-LLM applications. In this paper, we introduce
a novel approach to address these shortcomings. We build on the natural
sequential structure of activation data in both axes (layers $\times$ tokens)
and advocate treating full activation tensors akin to images. We design
ACT-ViT, a Vision Transformer-inspired model that can be effectively and
efficiently applied to activation tensors and supports training on data from
multiple LLMs simultaneously. Through comprehensive experiments encompassing
diverse LLMs and datasets, we demonstrate that ACT-ViT consistently outperforms
traditional probing techniques while remaining extremely efficient for
deployment. In particular, we show that our architecture benefits substantially
from multi-LLM training, achieves strong zero-shot performance on unseen
datasets, and can be transferred effectively to new LLMs through fine-tuning.

Motivation: 深度学习模型在非平稳环境中会出现塑性丧失现象，即模型未来学习能力退化，这阻碍了模型在持续学习场景中的应用。

Method: 基于动力系统理论，通过识别参数空间中的稳定流形来形式化定义塑性丧失，分析激活饱和导致的冻结单元和表示冗余导致的克隆单元流形这两种主要机制。

Result: 研究发现低秩表示和简单性偏好等促进静态泛化的特性，在持续学习场景中会直接导致塑性丧失，并通过数值模拟验证了理论分析。

Conclusion: 该框架揭示了泛化与塑性之间的基本张力，并探讨了架构选择或针对性扰动作为潜在的缓解策略。

Abstract: Deep learning models excel in stationary data but struggle in non-stationary
environments due to a phenomenon known as loss of plasticity (LoP), the
degradation of their ability to learn in the future. This work presents a
first-principles investigation of LoP in gradient-based learning. Grounded in
dynamical systems theory, we formally define LoP by identifying stable
manifolds in the parameter space that trap gradient trajectories. Our analysis
reveals two primary mechanisms that create these traps: frozen units from
activation saturation and cloned-unit manifolds from representational
redundancy. Our framework uncovers a fundamental tension: properties that
promote generalization in static settings, such as low-rank representations and
simplicity biases, directly contribute to LoP in continual learning scenarios.
We validate our theoretical analysis with numerical simulations and explore
architectural choices or targeted perturbations as potential mitigation
strategies.

TL;DR: 本文研究了带有随机延迟反馈的Lipschitz赌博机问题，针对有界和无界延迟分别提出了算法，在有界延迟下保持了无延迟设置的最优性能，在无界延迟下达到了接近最优的遗憾界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的Lipschitz赌博机问题假设奖励可以立即观察到，但在实际应用中反馈往往存在随机延迟。本文旨在解决带有随机延迟反馈的Lipschitz赌博机问题。

Method: 对于有界延迟，提出了延迟感知的缩放算法；对于无界延迟，设计了新颖的分阶段学习策略，在精心安排的间隔内积累可靠反馈。

Result: 在有界延迟下，算法保持了无延迟设置的最优性能，仅增加了一个与最大延迟相关的项；在无界延迟下，方法达到了接近最优的遗憾界（最多相差对数因子）。

Conclusion: 本文提出的算法在多种延迟场景下都表现高效，为带有随机延迟反馈的Lipschitz赌博机问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The Lipschitz bandit problem extends stochastic bandits to a continuous
action set defined over a metric space, where the expected reward function
satisfies a Lipschitz condition. In this work, we introduce a new problem of
Lipschitz bandit in the presence of stochastic delayed feedback, where the
rewards are not observed immediately but after a random delay. We consider both
bounded and unbounded stochastic delays, and design algorithms that attain
sublinear regret guarantees in each setting. For bounded delays, we propose a
delay-aware zooming algorithm that retains the optimal performance of the
delay-free setting up to an additional term that scales with the maximal delay
$\tau_{\max}$. For unbounded delays, we propose a novel phased learning
strategy that accumulates reliable feedback over carefully scheduled intervals,
and establish a regret lower bound showing that our method is nearly optimal up
to logarithmic factors. Finally, we present experimental results to demonstrate
the efficiency of our algorithms under various delay scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiSC-AMC是一种高效的自适应调制分类方法，通过离散化统计特征、精简上下文和优化提示模板，在减少50%以上计算资源的同时保持竞争性精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于LLM的调制分类方法中长提示上下文和大模型规模阻碍实际部署的问题，目标是实现更高效的在线部署。

Method: 将高阶统计量和累积量离散化为紧凑符号标记；通过轻量级k-top神经预过滤器和从先前LLM响应中提取的理性来修剪示例列表；使用校准的提示模板强制仅输出标签预测。

Result: 在10种调制类型的合成AMC噪声环境下，使用约5B参数的Gemini-2.5-Flash模型达到45.5%准确率，相比7B参数的DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen基线(5.2%)显著提升，同时减少50%以上的输入/输出标记和模型参数。

Conclusion: 精心设计的离散化和上下文选择可以在保持基于提示的AMC优势的同时，将推理成本降低2倍以上，实现实用的在线使用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform Automatic Modulation Classification
(AMC) in an open-set manner without LLM fine-tuning when equipped with
carefully designed in-context prompts~\cite{rostami2025plug}. Building on this
prior work, we target the practical bottlenecks of long prompt contexts and
large model sizes that impede in-the-loop deployment. We present Discretized
Statistics in-Context Automatic Modulation Classification (DiSC-AMC), a token-
and parameter-efficient variant that: (i) discretizes higher-order statistics
and cumulants into compact symbolic tokens, (ii) prunes the exemplar list via a
lightweight k-top neural prefilter and filters misleading/low-impact features
using rationales extracted from prior LLM responses, and (iii) enforces
label-only predictions through a calibrated prompt template. Together, these
changes reduce both input/output tokens and the model parameter footprint by
more than half while maintaining competitive accuracy. On synthetic AMC with
ten modulation types under noise, a 7B \textit{DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen}
baseline achieves 5.2% accuracy, whereas our system, using an approximately
5B-parameter \textit{Gemini-2.5-Flash}~\cite{comanici2025gemini} model, attains
45.5% accuracy. These results demonstrate that careful discretization and
context selection can cut inference cost by over 2x while preserving the
advantages of prompt-based AMC and enabling practical in-the-loop use.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DecepChain是一种新型后门攻击范式，通过引导LLM生成看似合理但最终得出错误结论的推理链，利用模型自身幻觉并强化错误推理，具有高度隐蔽性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM依赖思维链进行推理判断，这种依赖形成了强大但脆弱的信任基础。攻击者可能诱导LLM生成表面合理但实际错误的推理链，这种隐蔽风险尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 利用LLM自身幻觉，通过对模型自然生成的错误推理进行微调，并使用GRPO策略优化结合翻转奖励和合理性正则化器，强化错误推理同时保持推理流畅性。

Result: 在多个基准测试和模型上，DecepChain实现了高攻击成功率，在良性场景下性能下降最小。人类评估显示难以区分被操纵的推理过程与良性推理。

Conclusion: 这种隐蔽的失败模式可能悄无声息地破坏LLM答案并削弱人类对LLM推理的信任，迫切需要未来研究应对这一警示性风险。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been demonstrating increasingly strong
reasoning capability with their chain-of-thoughts (CoT), which are routinely
used by humans to judge answer quality. This reliance creates a powerful yet
fragile basis for trust. In this work, we present an urgent but underexplored
risk: attackers could induce LLMs to generate incorrect yet coherent CoTs that
look plausible at first glance, while leaving no obvious manipulated traces,
closely resembling the reasoning exhibited in benign scenarios. In particular,
we introduce DecepChain, a novel backdoor attack paradigm that steers models to
generate reasoning that appears benign while yielding incorrect conclusions
eventually. At a high level, DecepChain exploits LLMs' own hallucination and
amplifies it by fine-tuning on naturally erroneous rollouts generated by the
model itself and then reinforces it via Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) with a flipped reward on triggered inputs, plus a plausibility
regularizer to preserve fluent, benign-looking reasoning. Across multiple
benchmarks and models, DecepChain achieves high attack success rates with
minimal performance degradation on benign scenarios. Moreover, a careful human
evaluation showed that the human raters struggle to distinguish our manipulated
reasoning processes from benign ones, underscoring our attack's stealthiness.
Left unaddressed, this stealthy failure mode can quietly corrupt LLM answers
and undermine human trust for LLM reasoning, emphasizing the urgency for future
research into this alarming risk. Project page: https://decepchain.github.io/.

Abstract: The exponential growth of internet generated data has fueled advancements in
artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) for
extracting actionable insights in marketing,telecom, and health sectors. This
chapter explores ML applications across three domains namely healthcare,
marketing, and telecommunications, with a primary focus on developing a
framework for optimal ML algorithm selection. In healthcare, the framework
addresses critical challenges such as cardiovascular disease prediction
accounting for 28.1% of global deaths and fetal health classification into
healthy or unhealthy states, utilizing three datasets. ML algorithms are
categorized into eager, lazy, and hybrid learners, selected based on dataset
attributes, performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall), and Akaike
Information Criterion (AIC) scores. For validation, eight datasets from the
three sectors are employed in the experiments. The key contribution is a
recommendation framework that identifies the best ML model according to input
attributes, balancing performance evaluation and model complexity to enhance
efficiency and accuracy in diverse real-world applications. This approach
bridges gaps in automated model selection, offering practical implications for
interdisciplinary ML deployment.

Motivation: 跳跃连接虽然能稳定Transformer的训练，但会破坏表示的层次结构。本文旨在探索是否能在不改变标准架构的情况下，通过改进初始化策略来稳定无跳跃连接的Transformer训练。

Method: 通过分析无跳跃连接Transformer块的雅可比矩阵，揭示了跳跃连接改善条件数的机制，并基于此设计了一个原则性的初始化策略来恢复其稳定化效果。

Result: 在监督和自监督设置下，使用该初始化方法训练的无跳跃连接ViT克服了常规优化障碍，学习了更丰富的层次表示，并在密集预测基准测试中超越了带跳跃连接的强基线。

Conclusion: 跳跃连接不是训练ViT的基本要求，该方法为视觉模型中的层次表示学习开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Transformers have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of
applications, a feat often attributed to their scalability. Yet training them
without skip (residual) connections remains notoriously difficult. While skips
stabilize optimization, they also disrupt the hierarchical structure of
representations, raising the long-standing question of whether transformers can
be trained efficiently without them. In this work, we address this problem by
analyzing the Jacobian of a skipless transformer block, showing why skips
improve conditioning and revealing that their stabilization benefits can be
recovered through a principled initialization strategy. Building on this
insight, we introduce the first method that enables stable and efficient
training of skipless transformers without altering the standard architecture.
We validate our approach on Vision Transformers (ViTs) in both supervised and
self-supervised settings, demonstrating that skipless ViTs trained with our
initialization overcome the usual optimization barriers, learn richer
hierarchical representations, and outperform strong baselines, that incorporate
skip connections, on dense prediction benchmarks. These results show that skip
connections are not a fundamental requirement for training ViTs and open new
avenues for hierarchical representation learning in vision models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于CMDPs在不同初始状态分布下不存在普遍最优策略，每次初始分布变化都需要重新求解CMDP，这增加了计算复杂度。

Method: 使用CMDPs的对偶分析和线性规划扰动分析来推导最优值随初始分布变化的界限。

Result: 推导出了CMDPs最优值随初始分布变化的界限，并展示了如何利用这些界限分析策略遗憾。

Conclusion: 提出的界限可用于分析因初始分布未知变化导致的策略遗憾，为CMDPs在不同初始分布下的性能分析提供了理论工具。

Abstract: Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) are notably more complex to
solve than standard MDPs due to the absence of universally optimal policies
across all initial state distributions. This necessitates re-solving the CMDP
whenever the initial distribution changes. In this work, we analyze how the
optimal value of CMDPs varies with different initial distributions, deriving
bounds on these variations using duality analysis of CMDPs and perturbation
analysis in linear programming. Moreover, we show how such bounds can be used
to analyze the regret of a given policy due to unknown variations of the
initial distribution.

TL;DR: Kanzi是一个基于流的蛋白质结构分词器，使用扩散自编码器和流匹配损失来简化蛋白质结构表示，在较小模型尺寸下实现了更好的重建性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有蛋白质结构分词方法依赖定制组件，难以优化和扩展。需要简化蛋白质结构表示和训练过程。

Method: 采用扩散自编码器结合流匹配损失，用全局坐标替代基于框架的表示，用标准注意力替代SE(3)不变注意力。

Result: 该方法在重建指标上优于现有分词器，模型尺寸和训练成本显著降低。自回归模型性能优于基于token的生成模型，但尚未达到最先进连续扩散模型水平。

Conclusion: Kanzi简化了蛋白质结构分词器的多个方面，实现了更稳定高效的训练，为多模态蛋白质建模提供了更好的基础。

Abstract: Protein structure tokenizers enable the creation of multimodal models of
protein structure, sequence, and function. Current approaches to protein
structure tokenization rely on bespoke components that are invariant to spatial
symmetries, but that are challenging to optimize and scale. We present Kanzi, a
flow-based tokenizer for tokenization and generation of protein structures.
Kanzi consists of a diffusion autoencoder trained with a flow matching loss. We
show that this approach simplifies several aspects of protein structure
tokenizers: frame-based representations can be replaced with global
coordinates, complex losses are replaced with a single flow matching loss, and
SE(3)-invariant attention operations can be replaced with standard attention.
We find that these changes stabilize the training of parameter-efficient models
that outperform existing tokenizers on reconstruction metrics at a fraction of
the model size and training cost. An autoregressive model trained with Kanzi
outperforms similar generative models that operate over tokens, although it
does not yet match the performance of state-of-the-art continuous diffusion
models. Code is available here: https://github.com/rdilip/kanzi/.

Motivation: 现有生成框架主要在连续空间中运行且仅支持单目标指导，而离散方法缺乏多目标Pareto最优性保证

Method: 基于Rectified Discrete Flows，结合Tchebycheff标量化、局部平衡提议和退火Metropolis-Hastings更新，在保持分布不变性的同时偏向采样Pareto最优状态

Result: 在肽和SMILES序列设计中同时优化多达五个治疗特性（亲和力、溶解度、溶血性、半衰期和非污染性），优于进化和基于扩散的基线方法

Conclusion: AReUReDi成为多特性生物分子生成的强大序列框架

Abstract: Designing sequences that satisfy multiple, often conflicting, objectives is a
central challenge in therapeutic and biomolecular engineering. Existing
generative frameworks largely operate in continuous spaces with
single-objective guidance, while discrete approaches lack guarantees for
multi-objective Pareto optimality. We introduce AReUReDi (Annealed Rectified
Updates for Refining Discrete Flows), a discrete optimization algorithm with
theoretical guarantees of convergence to the Pareto front. Building on
Rectified Discrete Flows (ReDi), AReUReDi combines Tchebycheff scalarization,
locally balanced proposals, and annealed Metropolis-Hastings updates to bias
sampling toward Pareto-optimal states while preserving distributional
invariance. Applied to peptide and SMILES sequence design, AReUReDi
simultaneously optimizes up to five therapeutic properties (including affinity,
solubility, hemolysis, half-life, and non-fouling) and outperforms both
evolutionary and diffusion-based baselines. These results establish AReUReDi as
a powerful, sequence-based framework for multi-property biomolecule generation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出仅查询注意力机制，在持续学习中显著缓解塑性损失和灾难性遗忘，性能优于选择性重初始化基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习面临数据分布漂移的挑战，传统注意力机制可能过于复杂。研究旨在简化注意力机制同时保持核心归纳偏置。

Method: 使用仅查询注意力机制，丢弃键和值，但保留transformer架构的核心归纳偏置。通过Hessian谱分析观察模型曲率。

Result: 仅查询注意力在持续学习场景中显著改善塑性损失和灾难性遗忘，性能优于基线方法。高曲率秩模型更易保持塑性。

Conclusion: 完整注意力对于在持续学习中捕获元学习益处并非必需，简化机制同样有效且能更好地保持模型塑性。

Abstract: Continual learning involves learning from a stream of data without repetition
of data points, a scenario that is inherently complex due to distributional
shift across tasks. We propose a query-only attention mechanism that discards
keys and values, yet preserves the core inductive bias of transformer
architectures. In continual learning scenarios, this simplified mechanism
significantly mitigates both loss of plasticity and catastrophic forgetting,
outperforming baselines such as selective re-initialization. We establish a
conceptual link between query-only attention, full transformer attention, and
model agnostic meta-learning, framing them as instances of meta-learning. We
further provide intuition for why query-based models and attention networks
help preserve plasticity in continual settings. Finally, through preliminary
Hessian spectrum analysis, we observe that models maintaining higher curvature
rank across tasks tend to retain plasticity. Our findings suggest that full
attention may not be essential for capturing the benefits of meta-learning in
continual learning.

Conclusion: GDLNN通过结合GDL和神经网络，成功实现了高精度和可解释性的图分类，为图机器学习提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present GDLNN, a new graph machine learning architecture, for graph
classification tasks. GDLNN combines a domain-specific programming language,
called GDL, with neural networks. The main strength of GDLNN lies in its GDL
layer, which generates expressive and interpretable graph representations.
Since the graph representation is interpretable, existing model explanation
techniques can be directly applied to explain GDLNN's predictions. Our
evaluation shows that the GDL-based representation achieves high accuracy on
most graph classification benchmark datasets, outperforming dominant graph
learning methods such as GNNs. Applying an existing model explanation technique
also yields high-quality explanations of GDLNN's predictions. Furthermore, the
cost of GDLNN is low when the explanation cost is included.

TL;DR: 提出了Composer框架，用于自动化搜索混合模型架构，发现的新架构在350M-3B参数规模下超越了Llama 3.2，在验证损失和下游任务准确率上均有提升，同时提高了训练和推理效率。


<details>

Motivation: 现有混合模型架构设计主要依赖人工探索，由于设计空间巨大和训练成本高昂，难以有效发现适合预训练的关键计算原语组合。

Method: 开发了模块化混合模型架构搜索框架Composer，在小规模探索架构，然后通过提出的缩放策略将表现最好的架构扩展到更大规模。

Result: 发现的新混合LLM架构在350M-3B参数规模下验证损失低于Llama 3.2，下游任务准确率提升1.1-3.1%（最高8.3%），同时训练和推理效率均有提升。

Conclusion: Composer框架能够有效自动化发现高性能混合模型架构，证明了自动化架构搜索在大型语言模型设计中的价值。

Abstract: Hybrid model architectures that combine computational primitives (e.g.,
Attention, MLP) in different ratios have shown promising performance beyond
Transformers. Some studies have shown that different interleavings of
primitives can affect model quality as well. However, prior works explore the
hybrid model architecture design space manually. Due to the large design space
and training costs, discovering hybrid models that combine key computational
primitives for pre-training is challenging. In this work, we take a principled
approach in designing a modular hybrid model architecture search framework --
Composer. Composer explores model architectures at a small scale and
extrapolates the top-performing model architectures to a larger scale using our
proposed scaling strategies. Using Composer, we discover new hybrid LLM
architectures that outperform Llama 3.2. Compared to Llama 3.2 and previous
state-of-the-art baselines, the new model architectures consistently reduce
validation loss at parameter scales of 350M-3B and improve evaluation accuracy
on the downstream tasks by up to 2.8-8.3% (1.1-3.1% on average) while improving
both training and inference efficiency.

Result: 在MNIST数据集上实现10倍延迟减少，在多种密度估计基准测试中能学习比先前方法多10倍变量的分布。

Conclusion: 该方法为概率张量网络学习提供了一种高效稳定的解决方案，显著提升了建模能力。

Abstract: Tensor networks (TNs) enable compact representations of large tensors through
shared parameters. Their use in probabilistic modeling is particularly
appealing, as probabilistic tensor networks (PTNs) allow for tractable
computation of marginals. However, existing approaches for learning parameters
of PTNs are either computationally demanding and not fully compatible with
automatic differentiation frameworks, or numerically unstable. In this work, we
propose a conceptually simple approach for learning PTNs efficiently, that is
numerically stable. We show our method provides significant improvements in
time and space complexity, achieving 10x reduction in latency for generative
modeling on the MNIST dataset. Furthermore, our approach enables learning of
distributions with 10x more variables than previous approaches when applied to
a variety of density estimation benchmarks. Our code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的数据选择方法，通过反转训练和验证集的角色，选择在验证集上微调后预测变化最大的训练样本，从而更有效地选择对目标分布有益的训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据选择方法将目标样本作为验证集，通过从训练池中添加或删除单个样本来估计效果，这种方法效率较低。当目标分布只有少量样本可用时，需要更简单快速的数据选择方法。

Method: 反转训练和验证集的角色：先在训练池上进行推理，然后在验证集上微调后再次在训练池上推理，选择预测变化最大的样本。关键洞察是：受小验证集微调影响最大的训练样本通常对减少目标分布上的测试损失最有益。

Result: 在指令调优和命名实体识别任务上的实验表明，在大多数情况下，该方法比现有最先进方法实现了更低的测试对数损失。

Conclusion: 提出的方法提供了一种更简单快速的数据选择替代方案，通过理论分析和实验验证了其有效性，能够更好地选择对目标分布有益的训练样本。

Abstract: State-of-the-art machine learning often follows a two-stage process:
$(i)$~pre-training on large, general-purpose datasets; $(ii)$~fine-tuning on
task-specific data. In fine-tuning, selecting training examples that closely
reflect the target distribution is crucial. However, it is often the case that
only a few samples are available from the target distribution. Existing data
selection methods treat these target samples as a validation set and estimate
the effect of adding or removing a single sample from the training pool by
performing inference on the validation set.
  We propose a simpler and faster alternative that inverts the usual role of
train and validation: we perform inference on the training pool before and
after fine-tuning on the validation set. We then select samples whose
predictions change the most. Our key insight is that the training samples most
affected by fine-tuning on a small validation set tend to be the most
beneficial for reducing test loss on the target distribution. Experiments on
instruction tuning and named entity recognition tasks show that, in most cases,
our method achieves lower test log-loss than state-of-the-art approaches. We
support our findings with theoretical analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于神经网络的方法在近似图相似性时存在计算开销大或无法有效利用图结构信息的问题，需要更高效的图嵌入方法。

Method: 将节点表示为封闭区域，在嵌入空间中恢复图的邻接模式，通过区域形状捕获图结构，体积反映图大小，用区域重叠近似MCS，用不相交部分作为GED代理。

Result: 在MCS相似性学习中相对准确率提升60.0%，能同时预测MCS和GED相似性，训练和推理均保持高效。

Conclusion: Graph2Region通过几何表示有效捕获图结构和规模信息，为图相似性计算提供全面评估，在准确性和效率方面均表现优异。

Abstract: Graph similarity is critical in graph-related tasks such as graph retrieval,
where metrics like maximum common subgraph (MCS) and graph edit distance (GED)
are commonly used. However, exact computations of these metrics are known to be
NP-Hard. Recent neural network-based approaches approximate the similarity
score in embedding spaces to alleviate the computational burden, but they
either involve expensive pairwise node comparisons or fail to effectively
utilize structural and scale information of graphs. To tackle these issues, we
propose a novel geometric-based graph embedding method called Graph2Region
(G2R). G2R represents nodes as closed regions and recovers their adjacency
patterns within graphs in the embedding space. By incorporating the node
features and adjacency patterns of graphs, G2R summarizes graph regions, i.e.,
graph embeddings, where the shape captures the underlying graph structures and
the volume reflects the graph size. Consequently, the overlap between graph
regions can serve as an approximation of MCS, signifying similar node regions
and adjacency patterns. We further analyze the relationship between MCS and GED
and propose using disjoint parts as a proxy for GED similarity. This analysis
enables concurrent computation of MCS and GED, incorporating local and global
structural information. Experimental evaluation highlights G2R's competitive
performance in graph similarity computation. It achieves up to a 60.0\%
relative accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art methods in MCS similarity
learning, while maintaining efficiency in both training and inference.
Moreover, G2R showcases remarkable capability in predicting both MCS and GED
similarities simultaneously, providing a holistic assessment of graph
similarity. Code available at https://github.com/liuzhouyang/Graph2Region.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次对单层Mamba模型的训练动态和上下文学习泛化能力进行了理论分析，发现Mamba通过线性注意力层选择信息丰富的上下文示例，并通过非线性门控层抑制异常值的影响，相比线性Transformer具有更强的抗干扰能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba模型在计算效率上优于Transformer模型，并在多种语言任务中表现出色，但其理论理解仍然有限，主要由于门控机制引入的非线性。本文旨在从理论上分析Mamba的训练动态和上下文学习能力。

Method: 分析单层Mamba模型（包含线性注意力组件和非线性门控层）的训练动态，研究其在包含加性异常值的提示下对未见二元分类任务的上下文学习泛化能力，并与线性Transformer在相同设置下进行比较。

Result: Mamba利用线性注意力层选择信息丰富的上下文示例，通过非线性门控层抑制异常值影响。虽然Mamba可能需要更多训练迭代才能收敛，但在异常值比例超过线性Transformer容忍阈值时仍能保持准确预测。

Conclusion: 理论分析表明Mamba在上下文学习中具有更强的鲁棒性，能够有效处理包含异常值的提示，这一发现得到了实证实验的支持。

Abstract: The Mamba model has gained significant attention for its computational
advantages over Transformer-based models, while achieving comparable
performance across a wide range of language tasks. Like Transformers, Mamba
exhibits in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, i.e., making predictions for
new tasks based on a prompt containing input-label pairs and a query, without
requiring fine-tuning. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical
understanding of Mamba remains limited, largely due to the nonlinearity
introduced by its gating mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, this paper
presents the first theoretical analysis of the training dynamics of a one-layer
Mamba model, which consists of a linear attention component followed by a
nonlinear gating layer, and its ICL generalization on unseen binary
classification tasks, even when the prompt includes additive outliers. Our
analysis shows that Mamba leverages the linear attention layer to select
informative context examples and uses the nonlinear gating layer to suppress
the influence of outliers. By establishing and comparing to the analysis of
linear Transformers under the same setting, we show that although Mamba may
require more training iterations to converge, it maintains accurate predictions
even when the proportion of outliers exceeds the threshold that a linear
Transformer can tolerate. These theoretical findings are supported by empirical
experiments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NC-Iso是一种新颖的图神经网络架构，通过保持节点根子树中特征的相对位置来解决子图匹配中的尺度差异问题，并引入相似性优势比增强度量来提高匹配对的排序能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于GNN的子图匹配方法存在尺度差异问题，它们关注特征数量但忽略了特征在节点根子树中的相对位置，导致包含约束被破坏和错误预测。此外，它们的铰链距离度量对匹配图对缺乏区分能力，阻碍了排序应用。

Method: NC-Iso通过构建节点根子树内相邻梯队之间的层次依赖关系来保持特征的相对位置，确保匹配图对在特征数量上保持一致的层次结构并符合包含约束。引入相似性优势比增强度量来量化图对之间相似性相对于不相似性的优势程度。

Result: 在九个数据集上的实证结果验证了NC-Iso的有效性、泛化能力、可扩展性和可迁移性，同时保持了时间效率。

Conclusion: NC-Iso为子图检索提供了一个更具区分性的神经子图匹配解决方案，解决了现有方法的尺度差异和排序能力不足的问题。

Abstract: Subgraph matching is challenging as it necessitates time-consuming
combinatorial searches. Recent Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approaches
address this issue by employing GNN encoders to extract graph information and
hinge distance measures to ensure containment constraints in the embedding
space. These methods significantly shorten the response time, making them
promising solutions for subgraph retrieval. However, they suffer from scale
differences between graph pairs during encoding, as they focus on feature
counts but overlook the relative positions of features within node-rooted
subtrees, leading to disturbed containment constraints and false predictions.
Additionally, their hinge distance measures lack discriminative power for
matched graph pairs, hindering ranking applications. We propose NC-Iso, a novel
GNN architecture for neural subgraph matching. NC-Iso preserves the relative
positions of features by building the hierarchical dependencies between
adjacent echelons within node-rooted subtrees, ensuring matched graph pairs
maintain consistent hierarchies while complying with containment constraints in
feature counts. To enhance the ranking ability for matched pairs, we introduce
a novel similarity dominance ratio-enhanced measure, which quantifies the
dominance of similarity over dissimilarity between graph pairs. Empirical
results on nine datasets validate the effectiveness, generalization ability,
scalability, and transferability of NC-Iso while maintaining time efficiency,
offering a more discriminative neural subgraph matching solution for subgraph
retrieval. Code available at https://github.com/liuzhouyang/NC-Iso.

*Xudong Zhu,Mohammad Mahdi Khalili,Zhihui Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个从字典学习推导稀疏自编码器(SAE)的理论框架，揭示了现有SAE方法的局限性，并提出了AbsTopK SAE新变体来改进双向概念表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏自编码器缺乏理论推导框架，且其稀疏正则化器强制非负性，阻碍了单个特征表示双向概念的能力，导致语义轴分裂成冗余特征。

Method: 通过展开稀疏编码的近端梯度方法构建理论框架，发现单步更新可恢复常见SAE变体。提出AbsTopK SAE，基于ℓ0稀疏约束对最大幅度激活进行硬阈值处理，保留正负激活。

Result: 在4个LLM和7个探测与引导任务上的实验表明，AbsTopK提高了重建保真度、增强可解释性，使单个特征能编码对比概念，性能匹配甚至超过需要标注数据的监督方法。

Conclusion: AbsTopK SAE通过保留双向激活解决了现有SAE的局限性，提供了更丰富、完整的语义表示，在无监督设置下达到了监督方法的性能水平。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as powerful techniques for
interpretability of large language models (LLMs), aiming to decompose hidden
states into meaningful semantic features. While several SAE variants have been
proposed, there remains no principled framework to derive SAEs from the
original dictionary learning formulation. In this work, we introduce such a
framework by unrolling the proximal gradient method for sparse coding. We show
that a single-step update naturally recovers common SAE variants, including
ReLU, JumpReLU, and TopK. Through this lens, we reveal a fundamental limitation
of existing SAEs: their sparsity-inducing regularizers enforce non-negativity,
preventing a single feature from representing bidirectional concepts (e.g.,
male vs. female). This structural constraint fragments semantic axes into
separate, redundant features, limiting representational completeness. To
address this issue, we propose AbsTopK SAE, a new variant derived from the
$\ell_0$ sparsity constraint that applies hard thresholding over the
largest-magnitude activations. By preserving both positive and negative
activations, AbsTopK uncovers richer, bidirectional conceptual representations.
Comprehensive experiments across four LLMs and seven probing and steering tasks
show that AbsTopK improves reconstruction fidelity, enhances interpretability,
and enables single features to encode contrasting concepts. Remarkably, AbsTopK
matches or even surpasses the Difference-in-Mean method, a supervised approach
that requires labeled data for each concept and has been shown in prior work to
outperform SAEs.

TL;DR: 提出了ZO Fine-tuner，一种基于学习的零阶优化器，通过自动学习高效的扰动策略来优化大语言模型的微调过程，显著降低GPU内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的零阶方法依赖手工设计的静态采样策略，无法适应模型特定结构。观察到实践中只有少量基础模型及其衍生模型被广泛采用，因此为给定LLM学习一次优化器并在不同下游任务中重用是可行且理想的。

Method: 设计了一个紧凑且内存高效的零阶优化器，支持每个LLM一次性训练，最小化开销，将学习到学习（L2L）扩展到基础模型时代。

Result: 在4个LLM和7个数据集上的实验表明，ZO Fine-tuner在82.1%的任务-模型组合中优于先前的零阶基线方法。

Conclusion: ZO Fine-tuner展示了在大语言模型高效微调方面的强大性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: Zeroth-order optimizers have recently emerged as a practical approach for
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), significantly reducing GPU memory
consumption compared to traditional first-order methods. Yet, existing
zeroth-order methods rely on hand-crafted, static sampling strategies that are
not adaptable to model-specific structures. To address this, we propose ZO
Fine-tuner, a learning-based zeroth-order optimizer for LLMs that automatically
learns efficient perturbation strategies through a compact and memory-efficient
design. Crucially, our approach is motivated by the observation that only a
small number of foundation models and their derivatives are widely adopted in
practice. Therefore, learning the optimizer once for a given LLM and reusing it
across diverse downstream tasks is both feasible and highly desirable.
Accordingly, ZO Fine-tuner is designed to scale learning to learn (L2L) to the
foundation-model era by supporting one-time training per LLM with minimal
overhead. Experiments on 4 LLMs and 7 datasets show that ZO Fine-tuner
outperforms prior zeroth-order baselines in 82.1\% of task-model combinations,
thereby demonstrating strong performance and scalability for efficient LLM
fine-tuning. Our code is available at

Abstract: Automated structured radiology report generation (SRRG) from chest X-ray
images offers significant potential to reduce workload of radiologists by
generating reports in structured formats that ensure clarity, consistency, and
adherence to clinical reporting standards. While radiologists effectively
utilize available clinical contexts in their diagnostic reasoning, existing
SRRG systems overlook these essential elements. This fundamental gap leads to
critical problems including temporal hallucinations when referencing
non-existent clinical contexts. To address these limitations, we propose
contextualized SRRG (C-SRRG) that comprehensively incorporates rich clinical
context for SRRG. We curate C-SRRG dataset by integrating comprehensive
clinical context encompassing 1) multi-view X-ray images, 2) clinical
indication, 3) imaging techniques, and 4) prior studies with corresponding
comparisons based on patient histories. Through extensive benchmarking with
state-of-the-art multimodal large language models, we demonstrate that
incorporating clinical context with the proposed C-SRRG significantly improves
report generation quality. We publicly release dataset, code, and checkpoints
to facilitate future research for clinically-aligned automated RRG at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PromptLoop是一个基于强化学习的插件式框架，通过多模态大语言模型在扩散模型采样过程中逐步优化提示词，解决了传统RL微调在泛化性、可组合性和抗奖励攻击方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于强化学习的扩散模型微调方法存在泛化性差、可组合性弱和容易受到奖励攻击的问题。现有的提示词优化方法大多采用前馈方式，无法充分利用强化学习的序列特性。

Method: 训练一个多模态大语言模型，在扩散模型采样过程中基于中间潜在状态迭代更新提示词，而不是直接修改扩散模型权重，实现了与Diffusion RL类似的结构类比。

Result: 实验表明PromptLoop能有效优化奖励函数，无缝泛化到未见过的模型，与现有对齐方法正交组合，并能缓解过度优化和奖励攻击问题。

Conclusion: PromptLoop提供了一个灵活通用的提示词对齐框架，在保持扩散模型权重不变的情况下实现了有效的强化学习优化。

Abstract: Despite the recent progress, reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning of
diffusion models often struggles with generalization, composability, and
robustness against reward hacking. Recent studies have explored prompt
refinement as a modular alternative, but most adopt a feed-forward approach
that applies a single refined prompt throughout the entire sampling trajectory,
thereby failing to fully leverage the sequential nature of reinforcement
learning. To address this, here we introduce PromptLoop, a plug-and-play RL
framework that incorporates latent feedback into step-wise prompt refinement.
Rather than modifying diffusion model weights, a multimodal large language
model (MLLM) is trained with RL to iteratively update prompts based on
intermediate latent states of diffusion models. This design achieves a
structural analogy to the Diffusion RL approach, while retaining the
flexibility and generality of prompt-based alignment. Extensive experiments
across diverse reward functions and diffusion backbones demonstrate that
PromptLoop (i) achieves effective reward optimization, (ii) generalizes
seamlessly to unseen models, (iii) composes orthogonally with existing
alignment methods, and (iv) mitigates over-optimization and reward hacking.

TL;DR: 提出SADA方法，根据样本对模型优化的动态影响自动调整数据增强强度，解决传统固定或随机增强方法在动态训练环境中与模型需求不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据增强方法使用固定或随机变换，但样本难度会随模型泛化能力动态变化，这种不匹配会降低训练效果。

Method: 通过计算样本梯度在模型更新方向上的投影及其时间方差，动态调整增强强度：影响稳定的样本增强更强以增加多样性，不稳定样本增强更弱以保持语义保真度。

Result: 在各种基准数据集和模型架构上取得一致改进，细粒度任务提升7.3%，长尾数据集提升4.3%。

Conclusion: SADA是一种轻量级、即插即用的动态数据增强方法，能有效提升训练效果，具有实用价值。

Abstract: Data augmentation has been widely employed to improve the generalization of
deep neural networks. Most existing methods apply fixed or random
transformations. However, we find that sample difficulty evolves along with the
model's generalization capabilities in dynamic training environments. As a
result, applying uniform or stochastic augmentations, without accounting for
such dynamics, can lead to a mismatch between augmented data and the model's
evolving training needs, ultimately degrading training effectiveness. To
address this, we introduce SADA, a Sample-Aware Dynamic Augmentation that
performs on-the-fly adjustment of augmentation strengths based on each sample's
evolving influence on model optimization. Specifically, we estimate each
sample's influence by projecting its gradient onto the accumulated model update
direction and computing the temporal variance within a local training window.
Samples with low variance, indicating stable and consistent influence, are
augmented more strongly to emphasize diversity, while unstable samples receive
milder transformations to preserve semantic fidelity and stabilize learning.
Our method is lightweight, which does not require auxiliary models or policy
tuning. It can be seamlessly integrated into existing training pipelines as a
plug-and-play module. Experiments across various benchmark datasets and model
architectures show consistent improvements of SADA, including +7.3\% on
fine-grained tasks and +4.3\% on long-tailed datasets, highlighting the
method's effectiveness and practicality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个将控制理论中的矩阵草图技术应用于神经网络层激活的方法，通过指数移动平均和自适应秩调整来平衡内存效率与近似质量，实现内存高效的反向传播梯度重构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络训练中存储层激活的内存需求带来了显著的可扩展性挑战，需要找到内存高效的梯度计算方法。

Method: 采用控制理论中的矩阵草图技术，使用三个互补的草图矩阵通过指数移动平均和自适应秩调整来压缩层激活，实现梯度重构。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10和物理信息神经网络上的实验表明，该方法能够实现可控的精度-内存权衡，并在MNIST上展示了实时梯度范数跟踪应用。

Conclusion: 草图激活存储为内存高效的神经网络训练和分析提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Neural network training relies on gradient computation through
backpropagation, yet memory requirements for storing layer activations present
significant scalability challenges. We present the first adaptation of
control-theoretic matrix sketching to neural network layer activations,
enabling memory-efficient gradient reconstruction in backpropagation. This work
builds on recent matrix sketching frameworks for dynamic optimization problems,
where similar state trajectory storage challenges motivate sketching
techniques. Our approach sketches layer activations using three complementary
sketch matrices maintained through exponential moving averages (EMA) with
adaptive rank adjustment, automatically balancing memory efficiency against
approximation quality. Empirical evaluation on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and
physics-informed neural networks demonstrates a controllable accuracy-memory
tradeoff. We demonstrate a gradient monitoring application on MNIST showing how
sketched activations enable real-time gradient norm tracking with minimal
memory overhead. These results establish that sketched activation storage
provides a viable path toward memory-efficient neural network training and
analysis.

Motivation: 随着快速城市化，预测城市微气候变得至关重要，但现有生成式和同质图方法在物理一致性、空间依赖性和时间变异性方面存在不足。

Method: 提出UrbanGraph框架，集成异质动态时空图，编码植被蒸散发、遮阳和对流扩散等物理过程，建模多样化城市实体间的复杂空间依赖及其时间演化。

Conclusion: 该数据集为时空微气候建模提供了首个高分辨率基准，该方法可扩展到更广泛的城市异质动态计算任务。

Abstract: With rapid urbanization, predicting urban microclimates has become critical,
as it affects building energy demand and public health risks. However, existing
generative and homogeneous graph approaches fall short in capturing physical
consistency, spatial dependencies, and temporal variability. To address this,
we introduce UrbanGraph, a physics-informed framework integrating heterogeneous
and dynamic spatio-temporal graphs. It encodes key physical processes --
vegetation evapotranspiration, shading, and convective diffusion -- while
modeling complex spatial dependencies among diverse urban entities and their
temporal evolution. We evaluate UrbanGraph on UMC4/12, a physics-based
simulation dataset covering diverse urban configurations and climates. Results
show that UrbanGraph improves $R^2$ by up to 10.8% and reduces FLOPs by 17.0%
over all baselines, with heterogeneous and dynamic graphs contributing 3.5% and
7.1% gains. Our dataset provides the first high-resolution benchmark for
spatio-temporal microclimate modeling, and our method extends to broader urban
heterogeneous dynamic computing tasks.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in spatiotemporal data is a challenging problem encountered
in a variety of applications, including video surveillance, medical imaging
data, and urban traffic monitoring. Existing anomaly detection methods focus
mainly on point anomalies and cannot deal with temporal and spatial
dependencies that arise in spatio-temporal data. Tensor-based anomaly detection
methods have been proposed to address this problem. Although existing methods
can capture dependencies across different modes, they are primarily supervised
and do not account for the specific structure of anomalies. Moreover, these
methods focus mainly on extracting anomalous features without providing any
statistical confidence. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised
tensor-based anomaly detection method that simultaneously considers the sparse
and spatiotemporally smooth nature of anomalies. The anomaly detection problem
is formulated as a regularized robust low-rank + sparse tensor decomposition
where the total variation of the tensor with respect to the underlying spatial
and temporal graphs quantifies the spatiotemporal smoothness of the anomalies.
Once the anomalous features are extracted, we introduce a statistical anomaly
scoring framework that accounts for local spatio-temporal dependencies. The
proposed framework is evaluated on both synthetic and real data.

*Mingyuan Xia,Chunxu Zhang,Zijian Zhang,Hao Miao,Qidong Liu,Yuanshao Zhu,Bo Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出TimeEmb框架，通过静态-动态分解方法解决时间序列非平稳性问题，将时间序列分解为时间不变和时间变化两个互补组件，在减少计算资源的同时提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列的非平稳性（分布随时间变化）给可靠预测带来挑战。现有方法往往将时间变化和时间不变组件混在一起学习，导致面对分布偏移时性能不佳。

Method: TimeEmb框架包含：1）时间不变组件，通过全局嵌入模块学习跨时间序列的持久表示；2）时间变化组件，通过频域滤波机制处理，灵感来自信号处理中的全谱分析。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的实验表明，TimeEmb优于现有最先进基线方法，且需要更少计算资源。定性定量分析验证了静态-动态解缠的有效性。

Conclusion: TimeEmb是一个轻量级框架，能有效解决时间序列非平稳性问题，通过静态-动态分解提升预测性能，并可简单集成到现有时间序列预测方法中。

Abstract: Temporal non-stationarity, the phenomenon that time series distributions
change over time, poses fundamental challenges to reliable time series
forecasting. Intuitively, the complex time series can be decomposed into two
factors, \ie time-invariant and time-varying components, which indicate static
and dynamic patterns, respectively. Nonetheless, existing methods often
conflate the time-varying and time-invariant components, and jointly learn the
combined long-term patterns and short-term fluctuations, leading to suboptimal
performance facing distribution shifts. To address this issue, we initiatively
propose a lightweight static-dynamic decomposition framework, TimeEmb, for time
series forecasting. TimeEmb innovatively separates time series into two
complementary components: (1) time-invariant component, captured by a novel
global embedding module that learns persistent representations across time
series, and (2) time-varying component, processed by an efficient
frequency-domain filtering mechanism inspired by full-spectrum analysis in
signal processing. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that TimeEmb
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and requires fewer computational
resources. We conduct comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses to
verify the efficacy of static-dynamic disentanglement. This lightweight
framework can also improve existing time-series forecasting methods with simple
integration. To ease reproducibility, the code is available at
https://github.com/showmeon/TimeEmb.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有在线持续学习方法要么使用排练缓冲区存储样本，要么依赖任务边界信息，但这会带来数据安全/隐私问题，且在实际应用中任务边界往往不可知。

Method: 将提示学习与NCM分类器相结合，在不存储样本且不使用任务边界或身份信息的情况下处理灾难性遗忘。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的广泛实验证明了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了无排练和无任务边界的在线持续学习，有效缓解了灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: The main challenge of continual learning is \textit{catastrophic forgetting}.
Because of processing data in one pass, online continual learning (OCL) is one
of the most difficult continual learning scenarios. To address catastrophic
forgetting in OCL, some existing studies use a rehearsal buffer to store
samples and replay them in the later learning process, other studies do not
store samples but assume a sequence of learning tasks so that the task
identities can be explored. However, storing samples may raise data security or
privacy concerns and it is not always possible to identify the boundaries
between learning tasks in one pass of data processing. It motivates us to
investigate rehearsal-free and task-free OCL (F2OCL). By integrating prompt
learning with an NCM classifier, this study has effectively tackled
catastrophic forgetting without storing samples and without usage of task
boundaries or identities. The extensive experimental results on two benchmarks
have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TL;DR: 经验神经正切核（eNTK）的特征分析可以揭示神经网络使用的特征，在玩具模型和模块化加法任务中，eNTK的顶部特征空间与真实特征对齐，并能用于特征发现和检测相变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过eNTK分析来发现神经网络使用的特征，并检测训练过程中的相变现象，为机制解释性提供实用工具。

Method: 使用经验神经正切核（eNTK）进行特征分析，在两个标准玩具模型（TMS和单层MLP模块化加法）上验证eNTK谱特征与真实特征的对齐情况。

Result: eNTK在两种玩具模型中都表现出尖锐的谱悬崖，顶部特征空间与真实特征对齐；在TMS中恢复了稀疏和密集状态下的真实特征；在模块化算术中恢复了傅里叶特征族；层间eNTK能将特征定位到特定层；eNTK特征谱演化可用于诊断grokking相变。

Conclusion: eNTK分析为小模型中的特征发现和相变检测提供了实用的方法，有望成为机制解释性的有效工具。

Abstract: We provide evidence that eigenanalysis of the empirical neural tangent kernel
(eNTK) can surface the features used by trained neural networks. Across two
standard toy models for mechanistic interpretability, Toy Models of
Superposition (TMS) and a 1-layer MLP trained on modular addition, we find that
the eNTK exhibits sharp spectral cliffs whose top eigenspaces align with
ground-truth features. In TMS, the eNTK recovers the ground-truth features in
both the sparse (high superposition) and dense regimes. In modular arithmetic,
the eNTK can be used to recover Fourier feature families. Moreover, we provide
evidence that a layerwise eNTK localizes features to specific layers and that
the evolution of the eNTK eigenspectrum can be used to diagnose the grokking
phase transition. These results suggest that eNTK analysis may provide a
practical handle for feature discovery and for detecting phase changes in small
models.

### [250] [Diagnosing Shortcut-Induced Rigidity in Continual Learning: The Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00475)
*Kai Gu,Weishi Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI)指标，用于诊断持续学习中由捷径特征引起的认知固化现象，该现象会阻碍新技能的获取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络经常利用捷径特征（输入与标签间的偶然相关性），这会削弱鲁棒性。在持续学习中，捷径利用的后果会持续加剧：早期任务的权重会使表示重用偏向于最容易满足先前标签的特征，这类似于认知固化效应。

Method: 引入ERI诊断指标，包含三个可解释方面：(i)适应延迟(AD)、(ii)性能赤字(PD)、(iii)相对次优特征依赖(SFR_rel)。在CIFAR-100持续学习基准上，评估了多种持续学习方法在包含虚假洋红色补丁的第二阶段的表现。

Result: 持续学习方法比从头开始训练更快达到准确率阈值（负AD），但在有补丁的捷径类上最终准确率略低（正PD）。遮盖补丁提高了持续学习方法的准确率，但略微降低了从头开始训练的准确率，产生负SFR_rel。

Conclusion: 在该设置中，补丁对持续学习模型起到了干扰作用而非有益捷径，表明认知固化效应确实存在并阻碍了新任务的适应。

Abstract: Deep neural networks frequently exploit shortcut features, defined as
incidental correlations between inputs and labels without causal meaning.
Shortcut features undermine robustness and reduce reliability under
distribution shifts. In continual learning (CL), the consequences of shortcut
exploitation can persist and intensify: weights inherited from earlier tasks
bias representation reuse toward whatever features most easily satisfied prior
labels, mirroring the cognitive Einstellung effect, a phenomenon where past
habits block optimal solutions. Whereas catastrophic forgetting erodes past
skills, shortcut-induced rigidity throttles the acquisition of new ones. We
introduce the Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI), a compact diagnostic that
disentangles genuine transfer from cue-inflated performance using three
interpretable facets: (i) Adaptation Delay (AD), (ii) Performance Deficit (PD),
and (iii) Relative Suboptimal Feature Reliance (SFR_rel). On a two-phase
CIFAR-100 CL benchmark with a deliberately spurious magenta patch in Phase 2,
we evaluate Naive fine-tuning (SGD), online Elastic Weight Consolidation
(EWC_on), Dark Experience Replay (DER++), Gradient Projection Memory (GPM), and
Deep Generative Replay (DGR). Across these continual learning methods, we
observe that CL methods reach accuracy thresholds earlier than a Scratch-T2
baseline (negative AD) but achieve slightly lower final accuracy on patched
shortcut classes (positive PD). Masking the patch improves accuracy for CL
methods while slightly reducing Scratch-T2, yielding negative SFR_rel. This
pattern indicates the patch acted as a distractor for CL models in this setting
rather than a helpful shortcut.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有潜在扩散模型主要关注生成任务，其在判别性迁移方面的潜力尚未充分探索。本文旨在解决源自由域适应中无法访问源数据的核心挑战。

Method: DVD框架：在源域训练时，将每个源特征的标签信息编码到其潜在邻域中；在适应阶段，从目标特征的潜在邻域采样，应用冻结的扩散模块生成源式线索，使用InfoNCE损失对齐目标编码器。

Result: 在标准SFDA基准测试中，DVD优于最先进方法。相同的潜在扩散模块还能提升源分类器在域内数据的准确性，并在监督分类和域泛化实验中提升性能。

Conclusion: DVD将潜在扩散模型重新解释为实用、保护隐私的显式知识迁移桥梁，解决了源自由域适应中先前方法未能解决的核心挑战。

Abstract: Recent work on latent diffusion models (LDMs) has focused almost exclusively
on generative tasks, leaving their potential for discriminative transfer
largely unexplored. We introduce Discriminative Vicinity Diffusion (DVD), a
novel LDM-based framework for a more practical variant of source-free domain
adaptation (SFDA): the source provider may share not only a pre-trained
classifier but also an auxiliary latent diffusion module, trained once on the
source data and never exposing raw source samples. DVD encodes each source
feature's label information into its latent vicinity by fitting a Gaussian
prior over its k-nearest neighbors and training the diffusion network to drift
noisy samples back to label-consistent representations. During adaptation, we
sample from each target feature's latent vicinity, apply the frozen diffusion
module to generate source-like cues, and use a simple InfoNCE loss to align the
target encoder to these cues, explicitly transferring decision boundaries
without source access. Across standard SFDA benchmarks, DVD outperforms
state-of-the-art methods. We further show that the same latent diffusion module
enhances the source classifier's accuracy on in-domain data and boosts
performance in supervised classification and domain generalization experiments.
DVD thus reinterprets LDMs as practical, privacy-preserving bridges for
explicit knowledge transfer, addressing a core challenge in source-free domain
adaptation that prior methods have yet to solve.

Motivation: 解决黑盒域自适应在时间序列应用中的隐私安全问题，现有方法主要针对视觉应用且未探索基础模型的潜力，时间序列数据具有独特的时空特性需要专门处理。

Method: 构建基于时间序列基础模型的跨提示基础模型（CPFM），采用双分支网络结构，每个分支配备独特提示来捕捉数据分布的不同特征，在域自适应阶段开发了提示和输入级别的重建学习。

Conclusion: CPFM方法有效解决了黑盒时间序列域自适应问题，通过利用基础模型和提示学习机制克服了时空动态特性，在多个数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: The black-box domain adaptation (BBDA) topic is developed to address the
privacy and security issues where only an application programming interface
(API) of the source model is available for domain adaptations. Although the
BBDA topic has attracted growing research attentions, existing works mostly
target the vision applications and are not directly applicable to the
time-series applications possessing unique spatio-temporal characteristics. In
addition, none of existing approaches have explored the strength of foundation
model for black box time-series domain adaptation (BBTSDA). This paper proposes
a concept of Cross-Prompt Foundation Model (CPFM) for the BBTSDA problems. CPFM
is constructed under a dual branch network structure where each branch is
equipped with a unique prompt to capture different characteristics of data
distributions. In the domain adaptation phase, the reconstruction learning
phase in the prompt and input levels is developed. All of which are built upon
a time-series foundation model to overcome the spatio-temporal dynamic. Our
rigorous experiments substantiate the advantage of CPFM achieving improved
results with noticeable margins from its competitors in three time-series
datasets of different application domains.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了LLM推理的两种架构：双模块架构（Base与Coprocessor通过潜在消息通信）与单模型架构。在匹配潜在token预算下，联合微调的双架构表现最强，但单模型基线几乎能匹配其性能，表明当前双架构设计主要增加计算量而非显著改善推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM推理应该采用分离模块还是单模型架构，验证两种假设：增加通道容量和通过联合微调学习通信，以改进潜在推理能力。

Method: 在GPT-2和Qwen-3上测试双架构潜在推理，比较增加通道容量和联合微调两种方法，并与单模型软嵌入基线对比，使用GSM8K、ProsQA和Countdown压力测试进行评估。

Result: 在匹配潜在token预算下，联合微调的双架构表现最强，但单模型基线几乎能匹配其性能；增加通道容量仅带来有限提升；扩展潜在token预算无法提高鲁棒性；潜在空间分析显示有限的专业化。

Conclusion: 双模型潜在推理在原理上仍有前景，但可能需要明确塑造潜在空间的算法规划目标和通信机制。

Abstract: Should LLM reasoning live in a separate module, or within a single model's
forward pass and representational space? We study dual-architecture latent
reasoning, where a fluent Base exchanges latent messages with a Coprocessor,
and test two hypotheses aimed at improving latent communication over Liu et al.
(2024): (H1) increase channel capacity; (H2) learn communication via joint
finetuning. Under matched latent-token budgets on GPT-2 and Qwen-3, H2 is
consistently strongest while H1 yields modest gains. A unified soft-embedding
baseline, a single model with the same forward pass and shared representations,
using the same latent-token budget, nearly matches H2 and surpasses H1,
suggesting current dual designs mostly add compute rather than qualitatively
improving reasoning. Across GSM8K, ProsQA, and a Countdown stress test with
increasing branching factor, scaling the latent-token budget beyond small
values fails to improve robustness. Latent analyses show overlapping subspaces
with limited specialization, consistent with weak reasoning gains. We conclude
dual-model latent reasoning remains promising in principle, but likely requires
objectives and communication mechanisms that explicitly shape latent spaces for
algorithmic planning.

Motivation: 现有基于强化学习或直接反向传播的扩散对齐方法存在奖励过优化和模式崩溃问题，需要平衡奖励最大化和样本多样性

Method: 采用变分期望最大化框架：E步使用测试时搜索生成多样且奖励对齐的样本；M步利用E步发现的样本精炼扩散模型

Result: DAV在连续和离散任务（文本到图像合成和DNA序列设计）中都能优化奖励同时保持多样性

Conclusion: DAV框架有效解决了扩散对齐中的奖励过优化和模式崩溃问题，为扩散模型的下游任务优化提供了新思路

Abstract: Diffusion alignment aims to optimize diffusion models for the downstream
objective. While existing methods based on reinforcement learning or direct
backpropagation achieve considerable success in maximizing rewards, they often
suffer from reward over-optimization and mode collapse. We introduce Diffusion
Alignment as Variational Expectation-Maximization (DAV), a framework that
formulates diffusion alignment as an iterative process alternating between two
complementary phases: the E-step and the M-step. In the E-step, we employ
test-time search to generate diverse and reward-aligned samples. In the M-step,
we refine the diffusion model using samples discovered by the E-step. We
demonstrate that DAV can optimize reward while preserving diversity for both
continuous and discrete tasks: text-to-image synthesis and DNA sequence design.

Motivation: 研究差分注意力机制在提高任务相关焦点时，是否引入了对抗扰动的结构性脆弱性

Method: 理论分析负梯度对齐机制，并通过ViT/DiffViT、CLIP/DiffCLIP在五个数据集上的系统实验验证脆弱性原理

Result: 差分注意力导致更高的攻击成功率、频繁的梯度对立和更强的局部敏感性；深度实验显示在小扰动下具有噪声消除保护，但在大攻击预算下保护减弱

Conclusion: 差分注意力在干净输入上提高判别性焦点，但增加了对抗脆弱性，需要在未来注意力机制中同时考虑选择性和鲁棒性设计

Abstract: Differential Attention (DA) has been proposed as a refinement to standard
attention, suppressing redundant or noisy context through a subtractive
structure and thereby reducing contextual hallucination. While this design
sharpens task-relevant focus, we show that it also introduces a structural
fragility under adversarial perturbations. Our theoretical analysis identifies
negative gradient alignment-a configuration encouraged by DA's subtraction-as
the key driver of sensitivity amplification, leading to increased gradient
norms and elevated local Lipschitz constants. We empirically validate this
Fragile Principle through systematic experiments on ViT/DiffViT and evaluations
of pretrained CLIP/DiffCLIP, spanning five datasets in total. These results
demonstrate higher attack success rates, frequent gradient opposition, and
stronger local sensitivity compared to standard attention. Furthermore,
depth-dependent experiments reveal a robustness crossover: stacking DA layers
attenuates small perturbations via depth-dependent noise cancellation, though
this protection fades under larger attack budgets. Overall, our findings
uncover a fundamental trade-off: DA improves discriminative focus on clean
inputs but increases adversarial vulnerability, underscoring the need to
jointly design for selectivity and robustness in future attention mechanisms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个光谱利用指数(SUI)来量化语言模型前馈网络(FFN)中潜在空间的利用效率，发现软秩随宽度呈幂律增长，而硬秩增长缓慢且方差大，表明FFN加宽主要增加低能量尾方向，主导模式子空间早期饱和。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缩放定律关注模型大小与损失的关系，但忽略了组件如何有效利用其潜在空间。作者希望研究FFN宽度选择问题，将其重新定义为光谱利用问题。

Method: 使用轻量级诊断套件——硬秩(参与比)、软秩(香农秩)、光谱浓度和复合光谱利用指数(SUI)，在LLaMA、GPT-2和nGPT系列模型中量化有意义的潜在方向激活情况。

Result: 发现不对称的光谱缩放定律：软秩随FFN宽度几乎完美遵循幂律增长，而硬秩仅呈次线性增长且方差较大。在更大宽度下，方差进一步坍缩到狭窄子空间中。

Conclusion: FFN宽度选择应权衡尾容量和主导模式容量，为推理高效的大语言模型设计提供具体指导。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) scale, the question is not only how large
they become, but how much of their capacity is effectively utilized. Existing
scaling laws relate model size to loss, yet overlook how components exploit
their latent space. We study feed-forward networks (FFNs) and recast width
selection as a spectral utilization problem. Using a lightweight diagnostic
suite -- Hard Rank (participation ratio), Soft Rank (Shannon rank), Spectral
Concentration, and the composite Spectral Utilization Index (SUI) -- we
quantify how many latent directions are meaningfully activated across LLaMA,
GPT-2, and nGPT families. Our key finding is an asymmetric spectral scaling
law: soft rank follows an almost perfect power law with FFN width, while hard
rank grows only sublinearly and with high variance. This asymmetry suggests
that widening FFNs mostly adds low-energy tail directions, while dominant-mode
subspaces saturate early. Moreover, at larger widths, variance further
collapses into a narrow subspace, leaving much of the latent space
under-utilized. These results recast FFN width selection as a principled
trade-off between tail capacity and dominant-mode capacity, offering concrete
guidance for inference-efficient LLM design.

inconsistencies, each model's performance was assessed with $R^2$, Mean
Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Results show that RF
achieves the highest predictive accuracy ($R^2 = 0.9423$), significantly
outperforming LR and RDT. Interpretability was prioritized through p-values for
LR and feature importance metrics for the tree-based models, revealing
immunization rates (diphtheria, measles) and demographic attributes (HIV/AIDS,
adult mortality) as critical drivers of life-expectancy predictions. These
insights underscore the synergy between ensemble methods and transparency in
addressing public-health challenges. Future research should explore advanced
imputation strategies, alternative algorithms (e.g., neural networks), and
updated data to further refine predictive accuracy and support evidence-based
policymaking in global health contexts.

TL;DR: 该研究发现RL训练中LLM参数更新的两个基本特性：秩1主导性和秩1线性动态，并基于此提出AlphaRL加速框架，可在保持96%以上推理性能的同时实现2.5倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管强化学习推动了大型语言模型推理能力的显著提升，但RL训练过程中的参数动态变化机制仍不明确，需要深入理解以优化训练效率。

Method: 通过分析8个LLM和7种算法的RL训练过程，识别出参数更新的两个关键特性，并基于这些发现设计了AlphaRL加速框架，利用早期训练窗口外推最终参数更新。

Result: 实验验证了秩1主导性（恢复99%性能增益）和秩1线性动态的普适性，AlphaRL框架实现了2.5倍加速同时保持>96%的推理性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为大规模RL训练提供了原则性、可解释且高效的训练范式，揭示了LLM参数更新的内在规律。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are
largely driven by reinforcement learning (RL), yet the underlying parameter
dynamics during RL training remain poorly understood. This work identifies two
fundamental properties of RL-induced parameter updates in LLMs: (1) Rank-1
Dominance, where the top singular subspace of the parameter update matrix
nearly fully determines reasoning improvements, recovering over 99\% of
performance gains; and (2) Rank-1 Linear Dynamics, where this dominant subspace
evolves linearly throughout training, enabling accurate prediction from early
checkpoints. Extensive experiments across 8 LLMs and 7 algorithms validate the
generalizability of these properties. More importantly, based on these
findings, we propose AlphaRL, a plug-in acceleration framework that
extrapolates the final parameter update using a short early training window,
achieving up to 2.5 speedup while retaining \textgreater 96\% of reasoning
performance without extra modules or hyperparameter tuning. This positions our
finding as a versatile and practical tool for large-scale RL, opening a path
toward principled, interpretable, and efficient training paradigm for LLMs.

TL;DR: 该研究为状态空间模型(SSMs)提供了理论解释，揭示了记忆精度与长度之间的权衡关系，证明了初始参数的重要性，并提出固定循环权重可获得更好性能的训练策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 状态空间模型虽显示出超越Transformer的潜力，但先前研究缺乏对其学习动态的理论解释，无法充分理解其高性能机制。

Method: 通过分析输入时间序列如何存储在状态中评估SSMs的记忆容量，建立S4模型与简化对角循环权重S4的理论等价性，并基于此阐明学习动态。

Result: 实验证明在需要长记忆的任务中扩展记忆很困难，强调初始化的重要性；固定循环权重比自适应权重能获得相当或更高性能且收敛更快。

Conclusion: 研究为SSMs提供了新的理论基础，并可能提供一种新颖的优化策略。

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) have gained attention by showing potential to
outperform Transformers. However, previous studies have not sufficiently
addressed the mechanisms underlying their high performance owing to a lack of
theoretical explanation of SSMs' learning dynamics. In this study, we provide
such an explanation and propose an improved training strategy. The memory
capacity of SSMs can be evaluated by examining how input time series are stored
in their current state. Such an examination reveals a tradeoff between memory
accuracy and length, as well as the theoretical equivalence between the
structured state space sequence model (S4) and a simplified S4 with diagonal
recurrent weights. This theoretical foundation allows us to elucidate the
learning dynamics, proving the importance of initial parameters. Our analytical
results suggest that successful learning requires the initial memory structure
to be the longest possible even if memory accuracy may deteriorate or the
gradient lose the teacher information. Experiments on tasks requiring long
memory confirmed that extending memory is difficult, emphasizing the importance
of initialization. Furthermore, we found that fixing recurrent weights can be
more advantageous than adapting them because it achieves comparable or even
higher performance with faster convergence. Our results provide a new
theoretical foundation for SSMs and potentially offer a novel optimization
strategy.

TL;DR: PANORAMA通过机器学习驱动的正交变换解决ANNS验证瓶颈，将90%以上信号能量压缩到前半维度，实现早期候选剪枝和部分距离计算，在多种ANNS方法上获得2-30倍端到端加速且无召回损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前ANNS系统在最终精炼阶段花费高达99%的查询时间计算距离，存在严重的验证瓶颈问题。

Method: 使用数据自适应的学习正交变换，结合层级主内存布局、SIMD向量化部分距离计算和缓存感知访问模式，无需修改索引即可集成到现有ANNS方法中。

Result: 在多种数据集上实验表明，PANORAMA实现了2-30倍的端到端加速，且没有召回损失。

Conclusion: PANORAMA有效解决了ANNS系统的验证瓶颈问题，显著提升了查询效率。

Abstract: Approximate Nearest-Neighbor Search (ANNS) efficiently finds data items whose
embeddings are close to that of a given query in a high-dimensional space,
aiming to balance accuracy with speed. Used in recommendation systems, image
and video retrieval, natural language processing, and retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG), ANNS algorithms such as IVFPQ, HNSW graphs, Annoy, and MRPT
utilize graph, tree, clustering, and quantization techniques to navigate large
vector spaces. Despite this progress, ANNS systems spend up to 99\% of query
time to compute distances in their final refinement phase. In this paper, we
present PANORAMA, a machine learning-driven approach that tackles the ANNS
verification bottleneck through data-adaptive learned orthogonal transforms
that facilitate the accretive refinement of distance bounds. Such transforms
compact over 90\% of signal energy into the first half of dimensions, enabling
early candidate pruning with partial distance computations. We integrate
PANORAMA into state-of-the-art ANNS methods, namely IVFPQ/Flat, HNSW, MRPT, and
Annoy, without index modification, using level-major memory layouts,
SIMD-vectorized partial distance computations, and cache-aware access patterns.
Experiments across diverse datasets -- from image-based CIFAR-10 and GIST to
modern embedding spaces including OpenAI's Ada 2 and Large 3 -- demonstrate
that PANORAMA affords a 2--30$\times$ end-to-end speedup with no recall loss.

TL;DR: 本文提出了新的私有在线学习算法，在可实现设置中针对自适应对手实现了O_d(log T)的错误界限，在不可知设置中实现了Õ_d(√T)的次线性遗憾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前工作Golowich和Livni[2021]在可实现设置中针对遗忘型对手实现了O_d(log T)的错误界限，但对自适应对手只能达到Õ_d(√T)的次优界限。本文旨在缩小这一差距，并进一步研究不可知设置下的私有在线学习问题。

Method: 设计新的私有在线学习算法，利用Littlestone维度的概念类性质，通过改进的隐私保护机制来处理自适应对手的挑战。

Result: 在可实现设置中，新算法针对自适应对手实现了O_d(log T)的错误界限；在不可知设置中，实现了Õ_d(√T)的次线性遗憾，证明Littlestone类在不可知设置下也是私有在线可学习的。

Conclusion: 本文成功缩小了私有在线学习中针对不同类型对手的性能差距，并扩展了私有在线学习理论到更一般的不可知设置，为Littlestone类提供了完整的私有在线学习解决方案。

Abstract: We revisit the problem of private online learning, in which a learner
receives a sequence of $T$ data points and has to respond at each time-step a
hypothesis. It is required that the entire stream of output hypotheses should
satisfy differential privacy. Prior work of Golowich and Livni [2021]
established that every concept class $\mathcal{H}$ with finite Littlestone
dimension $d$ is privately online learnable in the realizable setting. In
particular, they proposed an algorithm that achieves an $O_{d}(\log T)$ mistake
bound against an oblivious adversary. However, their approach yields a
suboptimal $\tilde{O}_{d}(\sqrt{T})$ bound against an adaptive adversary. In
this work, we present a new algorithm with a mistake bound of $O_{d}(\log T)$
against an adaptive adversary, closing this gap. We further investigate the
problem in the agnostic setting, which is more general than the realizable
setting as it does not impose any assumptions on the data. We give an algorithm
that obtains a sublinear regret of $\tilde{O}_d(\sqrt{T})$ for generic
Littlestone classes, demonstrating that they are also privately online
learnable in the agnostic setting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Eyes-on-Me是一种模块化的RAG数据投毒攻击方法，通过可重用的注意力吸引器和焦点区域实现低成本攻击，在18个RAG设置中将攻击成功率从21.9%提升到57.8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统的数据投毒攻击扩展性差，需要为每个目标短语优化投毒文档，成本高昂。

Method: 将对抗文档分解为可重用的注意力吸引器和焦点区域，吸引器优化用于将注意力导向焦点区域，攻击者可在焦点区域插入语义诱饵或恶意指令。

Result: 在18个端到端RAG设置中，平均攻击成功率从21.9%提升到57.8%，单个优化后的吸引器无需重新训练即可迁移到未见过的黑盒检索器和生成器。

Conclusion: 该方法建立了可扩展的RAG数据投毒范式，表明模块化、可重用组件对现代AI系统构成实际威胁，同时揭示了注意力集中与模型输出之间的强关联。

Abstract: Existing data poisoning attacks on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
systems scale poorly because they require costly optimization of poisoned
documents for each target phrase. We introduce Eyes-on-Me, a modular attack
that decomposes an adversarial document into reusable Attention Attractors and
Focus Regions. Attractors are optimized to direct attention to the Focus
Region. Attackers can then insert semantic baits for the retriever or malicious
instructions for the generator, adapting to new targets at near zero cost. This
is achieved by steering a small subset of attention heads that we empirically
identify as strongly correlated with attack success. Across 18 end-to-end RAG
settings (3 datasets $\times$ 2 retrievers $\times$ 3 generators), Eyes-on-Me
raises average attack success rates from 21.9 to 57.8 (+35.9 points,
2.6$\times$ over prior work). A single optimized attractor transfers to unseen
black box retrievers and generators without retraining. Our findings establish
a scalable paradigm for RAG data poisoning and show that modular, reusable
components pose a practical threat to modern AI systems. They also reveal a
strong link between attention concentration and model outputs, informing
interpretability research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经天气模型在降水临近预报中会产生校准不良的概率预测，而标准校准指标如ECE无法有效捕捉不同降水阈值下的校准误差。

Method: 引入了期望阈值校准误差(ETCE)作为新的校准度量，并将计算机视觉中的后处理技术扩展到预报领域，采用选择缩放和提前时间条件化方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能够在不降低预报质量的前提下显著减少模型的校准误差。

Conclusion: ETCE能够更好地捕捉有序类别(如降水量)中的校准误差，所提出的后处理技术有效改善了降水临近预报的概率校准性能。

Abstract: Reliable precipitation nowcasting is critical for weather-sensitive
decision-making, yet neural weather models (NWMs) can produce poorly calibrated
probabilistic forecasts. Standard calibration metrics such as the expected
calibration error (ECE) fail to capture miscalibration across precipitation
thresholds. We introduce the expected thresholded calibration error (ETCE), a
new metric that better captures miscalibration in ordered classes like
precipitation amounts. We extend post-processing techniques from computer
vision to the forecasting domain. Our results show that selective scaling with
lead time conditioning reduces model miscalibration without reducing the
forecast quality.

TL;DR: 提出结构因果最优传输方法，通过结合结构方程信息来增强分布鲁棒优化中的模糊集，提高分布的现实性，并开发高效算法解决因果约束问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分布鲁棒优化方法仅利用因果图信息设计模糊集，忽略了结构方程信息。为了包含更现实的概率分布，需要同时利用因果图和结构方程信息来增强模糊集。

Method: 提出结构因果最优传输及其模糊集，引入正则化项替代复杂因果约束的松弛版本，使用凸差规划开发高效算法。

Result: 方法能有效处理结构信息缺失情况并提供有限样本保证，在最优传输问题中克服维度灾难，实现维度无关的快速收缩。

Conclusion: 结构因果最优传输通过整合结构方程信息显著提升了模糊集的现实性和算法效率，为分布鲁棒优化提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Distributionally robust optimization tackles out-of-sample issues like
overfitting and distribution shifts by adopting an adversarial approach over a
range of possible data distributions, known as the ambiguity set. To balance
conservatism and accuracy, these sets must include realistic probability
distributions by leveraging information from the nominal distribution. Assuming
that nominal distributions arise from a structural causal model with a directed
acyclic graph $\mathcal{G}$ and structural equations, previous methods such as
adapted and $\mathcal{G}$-causal optimal transport have only utilized causal
graph information in designing ambiguity sets. In this work, we propose
incorporating structural equations, which include causal graph information, to
enhance ambiguity sets, resulting in more realistic distributions. We introduce
structural causal optimal transport and its associated ambiguity set,
demonstrating their advantages and connections to previous methods. A key
benefit of our approach is a relaxed version, where a regularization term
replaces the complex causal constraints, enabling an efficient algorithm via
difference-of-convex programming to solve structural causal optimal transport.
We also show that when structural information is absent and must be estimated,
our approach remains effective and provides finite sample guarantees. Lastly,
we address the radius of ambiguity sets, illustrating how our method overcomes
the curse of dimensionality in optimal transport problems, achieving faster
shrinkage with dimension-free order.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FAME是一个端到端的函数对函数回归框架，通过结合双向神经控制微分方程和MoE驱动的向量场来捕捉函数内连续性，并使用多头交叉注意力融合函数间依赖关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 函数数据的无限维特性使得表示学习具有挑战性。传统统计模型依赖预选基展开或核函数，限制了数据驱动发现的灵活性，而深度学习管道通常将函数视为固定网格向量，忽略了固有的连续性。

Method: FAME框架结合双向神经控制微分方程和混合专家驱动的向量场来形成连续注意力，捕捉函数内连续性；使用多头交叉注意力融合函数间依赖关系变化。

Result: 在合成和真实世界函数回归基准测试中，FAME实现了最先进的准确性，对函数的任意采样离散观测具有强大的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FAME为函数数据表示学习提供了一个完全数据驱动的端到端解决方案，在准确性和鲁棒性方面表现优异。

Abstract: Functional data play a pivotal role across science and engineering, yet their
infinite-dimensional nature makes representation learning challenging.
Conventional statistical models depend on pre-chosen basis expansions or
kernels, limiting the flexibility of data-driven discovery, while many
deep-learning pipelines treat functions as fixed-grid vectors, ignoring
inherent continuity. In this paper, we introduce Functional Attention with a
Mixture-of-Experts (FAME), an end-to-end, fully data-driven framework for
function-on-function regression. FAME forms continuous attention by coupling a
bidirectional neural controlled differential equation with MoE-driven vector
fields to capture intra-functional continuity, and further fuses change to
inter-functional dependencies via multi-head cross attention. Extensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world functional-regression benchmarks show
that FAME achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, strong robustness to arbitrarily
sampled discrete observations of functions.

TL;DR: EF21-Muon是首个具有严格收敛保证的通信高效、非欧几里得LMO优化器，支持随机梯度、动量和双向压缩，在NanoGPT基准测试中实现了7倍的通信节省且无精度损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化器如Muon、Scion和Gluon虽然通过利用层间线性最小化预言机在非欧几里得范数球上推进了大规模深度学习，但缺乏原则性的分布式框架，通信瓶颈未解决，且现有分布式变体都是启发式的，没有收敛保证。

Method: 提出EF21-Muon，首个具有严格收敛保证的通信高效非欧几里得LMO优化器，支持随机梯度、动量和双向压缩，并首次将误差反馈扩展到非欧几里得设置。

Result: EF21-Muon在压缩关闭和特定范数选择时恢复Muon/Scion/Gluon，提供了该强大系列的首个高效分布式实现。在NanoGPT基准测试中，相比未压缩的Muon/Scion/Gluon实现了高达7倍的通信节省且无精度退化。

Conclusion: EF21-Muon填补了非欧几里得LMO优化器分布式实现的空白，提供了首个具有严格收敛保证的通信高效解决方案，理论分析覆盖非欧几里得平滑和更一般的(L^0, L^1)-平滑设置，匹配最佳已知欧几里得速率。

Abstract: Recent optimizers like Muon, Scion, and Gluon have pushed the frontier of
large-scale deep learning by exploiting layer-wise linear minimization oracles
(LMOs) over non-Euclidean norm balls, capturing neural network structure in
ways traditional algorithms cannot. Yet, no principled distributed framework
exists for these methods, and communication bottlenecks remain unaddressed. The
very few distributed variants are heuristic, with no convergence guarantees in
sight. We introduce EF21-Muon, the first communication-efficient, non-Euclidean
LMO-based optimizer with rigorous convergence guarantees. EF21-Muon supports
stochastic gradients, momentum, and bidirectional compression with error
feedback-marking the first extension of error feedback beyond the Euclidean
setting. It recovers Muon/Scion/Gluon when compression is off and specific
norms are chosen, providing the first efficient distributed implementation of
this powerful family. Our theory covers non-Euclidean smooth and the more
general $(L^0, L^1)$-smooth setting, matching best-known Euclidean rates and
enabling faster convergence under suitable norm choices. We further extend the
analysis to layer-wise (generalized) smoothness regimes, capturing the
anisotropic structure of deep networks. Experiments on NanoGPT benchmarking
EF21-Muon against uncompressed Muon/Scion/Gluon demonstrate up to $7\times$
communication savings with no accuracy degradation.

Motivation: 由于数字干预领域快速发展，需要优化数字发展组织的报告方式；传统单一模型在多分类任务中表现有限，需要探索更优方法。

Method: 使用决策树、k近邻、支持向量机、AdaBoost、随机梯度下降、朴素贝叶斯和逻辑回归等ML算法，采用One vs Rest方法构建组合模型，使用过采样处理类别不平衡问题。

Conclusion: 数据量不是影响性能的唯一因素，类内相似性和类间差异性对分类效果同样重要；One vs Rest方法在多分类任务中表现更优。

Abstract: Automated document classification is a trending topic in Natural Language
Processing (NLP) due to the extensive growth in digital databases. However, a
model that fits well for a specific classification task might perform weakly
for another dataset due to differences in the context. Thus, training and
evaluating several models is necessary to optimise the results. This study
employs a publicly available document database on worldwide digital development
interventions categorised under twelve areas. Since digital interventions are
still emerging, utilising NLP in the field is relatively new. Given the
exponential growth of digital interventions, this research has a vast scope for
improving how digital-development-oriented organisations report their work. The
paper examines the classification performance of Machine Learning (ML)
algorithms, including Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector
Machine, AdaBoost, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Naive Bayes, and Logistic
Regression. Accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score are utilised to evaluate
the performance of these models, while oversampling is used to address the
class-imbalanced nature of the dataset. Deviating from the traditional approach
of fitting a single model for multiclass classification, this paper
investigates the One vs Rest approach to build a combined model that optimises
the performance. The study concludes that the amount of data is not the sole
factor affecting the performance; features like similarity within classes and
dissimilarity among classes are also crucial.

Motivation: 结合深度学习和随机过程理论，提供基于物理的可解释参数化方法，阐明输入特征与风险之间的关系，为复杂系统中的生存现象建模提供原则性途径。

Method: 将事件时间表示为潜在扩散过程首次通过吸收边界的时间，神经网络将输入变量映射到初始条件、漂移和扩散等物理意义参数，使用布朗运动等FHT过程。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上与Cox回归和其他参数生存模型相比，预测准确性与最先进方法相当，同时保持基于物理的可解释参数化。

Conclusion: DeepFHT成功结合随机过程理论和深度学习，为生存分析提供了一种既准确又可解释的建模方法，能够捕捉时变风险而无需比例风险假设。

Abstract: We introduce DeepFHT, a survival-analysis framework that couples deep neural
networks with first hitting time (FHT) distributions from stochastic process
theory. Time to event is represented as the first passage of a latent diffusion
process to an absorbing boundary. A neural network maps input variables to
physically meaningful parameters including initial condition, drift, and
diffusion, within a chosen FHT process such as Brownian motion, both with drift
and driftless. This yields closed-form survival and hazard functions and
captures time-varying risk without assuming proportional-hazards.
  We compare DeepFHT with Cox regression and other existing parametric survival
models, using synthetic and real-world datasets. The method achieves predictive
accuracy on par with state-of-the-art approaches, while maintaining a
physics-based interpretable parameterization that elucidates the relation
between input features and risk. This combination of stochastic process theory
and deep learning provides a principled avenue for modeling survival phenomena
in complex systems.

Conclusion: TD-JEPA通过时序差分学习实现了跨多个策略的长期潜在动态预测，为无监督强化学习提供了一种有效的表示学习方法。

Abstract: Latent prediction--where agents learn by predicting their own latents--has
emerged as a powerful paradigm for training general representations in machine
learning. In reinforcement learning (RL), this approach has been explored to
define auxiliary losses for a variety of settings, including reward-based and
unsupervised RL, behavior cloning, and world modeling. While existing methods
are typically limited to single-task learning, one-step prediction, or
on-policy trajectory data, we show that temporal difference (TD) learning
enables learning representations predictive of long-term latent dynamics across
multiple policies from offline, reward-free transitions. Building on this, we
introduce TD-JEPA, which leverages TD-based latent-predictive representations
into unsupervised RL. TD-JEPA trains explicit state and task encoders, a
policy-conditioned multi-step predictor, and a set of parameterized policies
directly in latent space. This enables zero-shot optimization of any reward
function at test time. Theoretically, we show that an idealized variant of
TD-JEPA avoids collapse with proper initialization, and learns encoders that
capture a low-rank factorization of long-term policy dynamics, while the
predictor recovers their successor features in latent space. Empirically,
TD-JEPA matches or outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on locomotion,
navigation, and manipulation tasks across 13 datasets in ExoRL and OGBench,
especially in the challenging setting of zero-shot RL from pixels.

Conclusion: 时间序列数据的多样性使得构建有效的基础模型面临挑战，专用模型在特定预测任务中可能更具优势。

Abstract: Foundation Models are designed to serve as versatile embedding machines, with
strong zero shot capabilities and superior generalization performance when
fine-tuned on diverse downstream tasks. While this is largely true for language
and vision foundation models, we argue that the inherent diversity of time
series data makes them less suited for building effective foundation models. We
demonstrate this using forecasting as our downstream task. We show that the
zero-shot capabilities of a time series foundation model are significantly
influenced and tied to the specific domains it has been pretrained on.
Furthermore, when applied to unseen real-world time series data, fine-tuned
foundation models do not consistently yield substantially better results,
relative to their increased parameter count and memory footprint, than smaller,
dedicated models tailored to the specific forecasting task at hand.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) largely rely on the message-passing paradigm,
where nodes iteratively aggregate information from their neighbors. Yet,
standard message passing neural networks (MPNNs) face well-documented
theoretical and practical limitations. Graph positional encoding (PE) has
emerged as a promising direction to address these limitations. The Euler
Characteristic Transform (ECT) is an efficiently computable
geometric-topological invariant that characterizes shapes and graphs. In this
work, we combine the differentiable approximation of the ECT (DECT) and its
local variant ($\ell$-ECT) to propose LEAP, a new end-to-end trainable local
structural PE for graphs. We evaluate our approach on multiple real-world
datasets as well as on a synthetic task designed to test its ability to extract
topological features. Our results underline the potential of LEAP-based
encodings as a powerful component for graph representation learning pipelines.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) unlearning aims to surgically remove the influence
of undesired data or knowledge from an existing model while preserving its
utility on unrelated tasks. This paradigm has shown promise in addressing
privacy and safety concerns. However, recent findings reveal that unlearning
effects are often fragile: post-unlearning manipulations such as weight
quantization or fine-tuning can quickly neutralize the intended forgetting.
Prior efforts to improve robustness primarily reformulate unlearning objectives
by explicitly assuming the role of vulnerability sources. In this work, we take
a different perspective by investigating the role of the optimizer, independent
of unlearning objectives and formulations, in shaping unlearning robustness. We
show that the 'grade' of the optimizer, defined by the level of information it
exploits, ranging from zeroth-order (gradient-free) to first-order
(gradient-based) to second-order (Hessian-based), is tightly linked to the
resilience of unlearning. Surprisingly, we find that downgrading the optimizer,
such as using zeroth-order methods or compressed-gradient variants (e.g.,
gradient sign-based optimizers), often leads to stronger robustness. While
these optimizers produce noisier and less precise updates, they encourage
convergence to harder-to-disturb basins in the loss landscape, thereby
resisting post-training perturbations. By connecting zeroth-order methods with
randomized smoothing, we further highlight their natural advantage for robust
unlearning. Motivated by these insights, we propose a hybrid optimizer that
combines first-order and zeroth-order updates, preserving unlearning efficacy
while enhancing robustness. Extensive experiments on the MUSE and WMDP
benchmarks, across multiple LLM unlearning algorithms, validate that our
approach achieves more resilient forgetting without sacrificing unlearning
quality.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的反馈交互范式——原位反馈，用户直接编辑LLM的先前响应，模型基于修改后的响应生成修订版本，在推理密集型任务中表现优于传统多轮反馈且使用更少token。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多轮反馈依赖用户发送新消息，LLMs难以可靠整合这些反馈，导致改进不一致。需要更有效的交互机制来指导LLMs进行复杂推理任务。

Method: 引入原位反馈范式，用户直接编辑LLM的先前响应，模型基于修改后的响应生成修订版本，而不是依赖新的消息反馈。

Result: 在多样化推理密集型基准测试中，原位反馈比传统多轮反馈性能更好，同时使用79.1%更少的token。控制环境分析表明原位反馈能更精确地修正错误部分。

Conclusion: 原位反馈为推理密集型任务提供了更自然有效的LLM指导机制，解决了多轮反馈的核心限制——模型难以精确应用反馈到错误部分的问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly studied in the context of
multi-turn reasoning, where models iteratively refine their outputs based on
user-provided feedback. Such settings are crucial for tasks that require
complex reasoning, yet existing feedback paradigms often rely on issuing new
messages. LLMs struggle to integrate these reliably, leading to inconsistent
improvements. In this work, we introduce in-place feedback, a novel interaction
paradigm in which users directly edit an LLM's previous response, and the model
conditions on this modified response to generate its revision. Empirical
evaluations on diverse reasoning-intensive benchmarks reveal that in-place
feedback achieves better performance than conventional multi-turn feedback
while using $79.1\%$ fewer tokens. Complementary analyses on controlled
environments further demonstrate that in-place feedback resolves a core
limitation of multi-turn feedback: models often fail to apply feedback
precisely to erroneous parts of the response, leaving errors uncorrected and
sometimes introducing new mistakes into previously correct content. These
findings suggest that in-place feedback offers a more natural and effective
mechanism for guiding LLMs in reasoning-intensive tasks.

Motivation: 复杂系统能产生多样的模式，但参数空间庞大且参数与模式间存在强非线性关系。艺术家和科学家在探索时通常对特定模式有预期，需要考虑这些预期来指导探索过程。

Method: 提供设计选择和实现，通过用户以系统无关方式表达的显式约束条件，在保持全局多样性的同时，在感兴趣区域内最大化模式多样性。

Result: 实现了样本高效的探索过程，能够在用户定义的约束条件下发现约束多样性，同时保持系统的全局多样性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效解决复杂系统探索中的挑战，通过约束条件指导探索，在用户感兴趣区域内实现模式多样性的最大化。

Abstract: The diversity of patterns that emerge from complex systems motivates their
use for scientific or artistic purposes. When exploring these systems, the
challenges faced are the size of the parameter space and the strongly
non-linear mapping between parameters and emerging patterns. In addition,
artists and scientists who explore complex systems do so with an expectation of
particular patterns. Taking these expectations into account adds a new set of
challenges, which the exploration process must address. We provide design
choices and their implementation to address these challenges; enabling the
maximization of the diversity of patterns discovered in the user's region of
interest -- which we call the constrained diversity -- in a sample-efficient
manner. The region of interest is expressed in the form of explicit
constraints. These constraints are formulated by the user in a system-agnostic
way, and their addition enables interactive system exploration leading to
constrained diversity, while maintaining global diversity.

Abstract: The efficient exploration of chemical space remains a central challenge, as
many generative models still produce unstable or non-synthesizable compounds.
To address these limitations, we present EvoMol-RL, a significant extension of
the EvoMol evolutionary algorithm that integrates reinforcement learning to

Extended Connectivity Fingerprints (ECFPs), EvoMol-RL learns context-aware
mutation policies that prioritize chemically plausible transformations. This
approach significantly improves the generation of valid and realistic

Conclusion: 该研究建立了社交媒体平台算法干预与多臂老虎机理论之间的关键联系，提出的算法在在线学习设置下有效解决了极化和分歧最小化问题。

Abstract: We study the problem of minimizing polarization and disagreement in the
Friedkin-Johnsen opinion dynamics model under incomplete information. Unlike
prior work that assumes a static setting with full knowledge of users' innate
opinions, we address the more realistic online setting where innate opinions
are unknown and must be learned through sequential observations. This novel
setting, which naturally mirrors periodic interventions on social media
platforms, is formulated as a regret minimization problem, establishing a key
connection between algorithmic interventions on social media platforms and
theory of multi-armed bandits. In our formulation, a learner observes only a
scalar feedback of the overall polarization and disagreement after an
intervention. For this novel bandit problem, we propose a two-stage algorithm
based on low-rank matrix bandits. The algorithm first performs subspace
estimation to identify an underlying low-dimensional structure, and then
employs a linear bandit algorithm within the compact dimensional representation
derived from the estimated subspace. We prove that our algorithm achieves an $
\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T}) $ cumulative regret over any time horizon $T$.
Empirical results validate that our algorithm significantly outperforms a
linear bandit baseline in terms of both cumulative regret and running time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GFlowNets采样策略倾向于过度探索，在大型搜索空间中难以持续生成高奖励样本，特别是在稀疏高奖励区域。因此，在不牺牲多样性的前提下提高生成高奖励样本的概率是一个关键挑战。

Method: 集成增强的MCTS到GFlowNets采样过程，使用MCTS策略评估引导轨迹生成，采用PUCT自适应平衡探索与利用，并引入可控机制调节贪婪程度。

Conclusion: 该方法通过动态平衡探索和奖励驱动指导，在不牺牲多样性的情况下增强了利用能力，有效解决了GFlowNets在大型稀疏奖励空间中的采样挑战。

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) have emerged as a powerful tool for
generating diverse and high-reward structured objects by learning to sample
from a distribution proportional to a given reward function. Unlike
conventional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches that prioritize
optimization of a single trajectory, GFlowNets seek to balance diversity and
reward by modeling the entire trajectory distribution. This capability makes
them especially suitable for domains such as molecular design and combinatorial
optimization. However, existing GFlowNets sampling strategies tend to
overexplore and struggle to consistently generate high-reward samples,
particularly in large search spaces with sparse high-reward regions. Therefore,
improving the probability of generating high-reward samples without sacrificing
diversity remains a key challenge under this premise. In this work, we
integrate an enhanced Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into the GFlowNets
sampling process, using MCTS-based policy evaluation to guide the generation
toward high-reward trajectories and Polynomial Upper Confidence Trees (PUCT) to
balance exploration and exploitation adaptively, and we introduce a
controllable mechanism to regulate the degree of greediness. Our method
enhances exploitation without sacrificing diversity by dynamically balancing
exploration and reward-driven guidance. The experimental results show that our
method can not only accelerate the speed of discovering high-reward regions but
also continuously generate high-reward samples, while preserving the diversity
of the generative distribution. All implementations are available at

Result: 实验显示，微调虽然能改善新任务性能，但通常会导致先前学习任务的显著性能下降，体现了稳定性-可塑性困境。

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have shown promising zero-shot
generalization across diverse forecasting tasks. However, their robustness to
continual adaptation remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate the
extent to which TSFMs suffer from catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuned
sequentially on multiple datasets. Using synthetic datasets designed with
varying degrees of periodic structure, we measure the trade-off between
adaptation to new data and retention of prior knowledge. Our experiments reveal
that, while fine-tuning improves performance on new tasks, it often causes
significant degradation on previously learned ones, illustrating a fundamental
stability-plasticity dilemma.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的分类器无关引导(CFG)使用静态权重虽然能提高感知质量，但会损害分布对齐。需要开发动态权重方法来更好地逼近目标条件分布。

Method: 学习连续函数形式的引导权重ω_c(s,t)，作为条件c、去噪起始时间t和目标时间s的函数。通过最小化真实条件分布与引导扩散过程之间的分布不匹配来实现。扩展到奖励引导采样，针对由奖励函数R(x_0,c)倾斜的分布。

Result: 在低维玩具示例和高维图像设置中验证有效性，观察到图像生成的FID改进。在文本到图像应用中，使用CLIP分数作为奖励函数可改善图像-提示对齐。

Conclusion: 动态学习引导权重的方法能有效改善条件扩散模型的分布对齐和感知质量，特别是在文本到图像生成任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique for improving the
perceptual quality of samples from conditional diffusion models. It operates by
linearly combining conditional and unconditional score estimates using a
guidance weight $\omega$. While a large, static weight can markedly improve
visual results, this often comes at the cost of poorer distributional
alignment. In order to better approximate the target conditional distribution,
we instead learn guidance weights $\omega_{c,(s,t)}$, which are continuous
functions of the conditioning $c$, the time $t$ from which we denoise, and the
time $s$ towards which we denoise. We achieve this by minimizing the
distributional mismatch between noised samples from the true conditional
distribution and samples from the guided diffusion process. We extend our
framework to reward guided sampling, enabling the model to target distributions
tilted by a reward function $R(x_0,c)$, defined on clean data and a
conditioning $c$. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology on
low-dimensional toy examples and high-dimensional image settings, where we
observe improvements in Fr\'echet inception distance (FID) for image
generation. In text-to-image applications, we observe that employing a reward
function given by the CLIP score leads to guidance weights that improve
image-prompt alignment.

Motivation: 现有策略梯度方法在大型语言模型推理中的优化稳定性研究不足，导致需要保守的超参数选择，增加了训练样本需求和计算成本。

Method: 形式化策略梯度的随机优化问题，考虑二阶几何信息；提出计算框架跟踪曲率信息；设计数据选择干预机制，识别并屏蔽导致不稳定更新的样本。

Result: 在标准数学推理基准测试中，CAPO在激进学习率下保持稳定更新，而基线方法会灾难性失败；仅屏蔽少于8%的token即可实现比标准GRPO高达30倍的样本效率提升。

Conclusion: CAPO通过曲率感知的优化方法有效解决了策略梯度在LLM推理中的稳定性问题，实现了更高效的训练和可扩展的后训练。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning, particularly through policy gradient methods, has
played a central role in enabling reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models. However, the optimization stability of policy gradients in this setting
remains understudied. As a result, existing implementations often resort to
conservative hyperparameter choices to ensure stability, which requires more
training samples and increases computational costs. Hence, developing models
for reliably tracking the underlying optimization dynamics and leveraging them
into training enables more sample-efficient regimes and further unleashes
scalable post-training. We address this gap by formalizing the stochastic
optimization problem of policy gradients with explicit consideration of
second-order geometry. We propose a tractable computational framework that
tracks and leverages curvature information during policy updates. We further
employ this framework to design interventions in the optimization process
through data selection. The resultant algorithm, Curvature-Aware Policy
Optimization (CAPO), identifies samples that contribute to unstable updates and
masks them out. Theoretically, we establish monotonic improvement guarantees
under realistic assumptions. On standard math reasoning benchmarks, we
empirically show that CAPO ensures stable updates under aggressive learning
regimes where baselines catastrophically fail. With minimal intervention
(rejecting fewer than 8% of tokens), CAPO achieves up to 30x improvement in
sample efficiency over standard GRPO for LLM reasoning.

Conclusion: 基于类别校准微调和FGTS.CDB算法的路由方法在LLM模型选择中表现出色，优于使用通用OpenAI嵌入模型的基线方法。

Abstract: We study LLM routing, the problem of selecting the best model for each query
while balancing user satisfaction, model expertise, and inference cost. We
formulate routing as contextual dueling bandits, learning from pairwise
preference feedback rather than absolute scores, thereby yielding
label-efficient and dynamic adaptation. Building on this formulation, we
introduce Category-Calibrated Fine-Tuning (CCFT), a representation-learning
method that derives model embeddings from offline data using contrastive
fine-tuning with categorical weighting. These embeddings enable the practical
instantiation of Feel-Good Thompson Sampling for Contextual Dueling Bandits
(FGTS.CDB), a theoretically grounded posterior-sampling algorithm. We propose
four variants of the categorical weighting that explicitly integrate model
quality and cost, and we empirically evaluate the proposed methods on the
RouterBench and MixInstruct datasets. Across both benchmarks, our methods
achieve lower cumulative regret and faster convergence, with better robustness
and performance-cost balance than strong baselines built with a general-purpose
OpenAI embedding model.

Abstract: The development of trustworthy artificial intelligence requires moving beyond
black-box performance metrics toward an understanding of models' internal
computations. Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) aims to meet this need by
identifying the algorithmic mechanisms underlying model behaviors. Yet, the
scientific rigor of MI critically depends on the reliability of its findings.
In this work, we argue that interpretability methods, such as circuit
discovery, should be viewed as statistical estimators, subject to questions of
variance and robustness. To illustrate this statistical framing, we present a
systematic stability analysis of a state-of-the-art circuit discovery method:
EAP-IG. We evaluate its variance and robustness through a comprehensive suite
of controlled perturbations, including input resampling, prompt paraphrasing,
hyperparameter variation, and injected noise within the causal analysis itself.
Across a diverse set of models and tasks, our results demonstrate that EAP-IG
exhibits high structural variance and sensitivity to hyperparameters,
questioning the stability of its findings. Based on these results, we offer a
set of best-practice recommendations for the field, advocating for the routine
reporting of stability metrics to promote a more rigorous and statistically
grounded science of interpretability.

Abstract: This paper presents a population synthesis model that utilizes the
Wasserstein Generative-Adversarial Network (WGAN) for training on incomplete
microsamples. By using a mask matrix to represent missing values, the study
proposes a WGAN training algorithm that lets the model learn from a training
dataset that has some missing information. The proposed method aims to address
the challenge of missing information in microsamples on one or more attributes
due to privacy concerns or data collection constraints. The paper contrasts
WGAN models trained on incomplete microsamples with those trained on complete
microsamples, creating a synthetic population. We conducted a series of
evaluations of the proposed method using a Swedish national travel survey. We
validate the efficacy of the proposed method by generating synthetic
populations from all the models and comparing them to the actual population
dataset. The results from the experiments showed that the proposed methodology
successfully generates synthetic data that closely resembles a model trained
with complete data as well as the actual population. The paper contributes to
the field by providing a robust solution for population synthesis with
incomplete data, opening avenues for future research, and highlighting the
potential of deep generative models in advancing population synthesis

Method: 分析基于分类器的质量过滤方法，比较其与通过随机标记排列生成的合成数据训练模型的行为差异。

Result: CQF能提升下游任务性能，但不一定改善高质量数据集上的语言建模；CQF会隐式过滤高质量数据集；与合成数据训练模型表现出截然不同的趋势。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了CQF捕捉有意义数据质量概念的观点，表明该方法存在局限性。

Abstract: Large-scale models are pretrained on massive web-crawled datasets containing
documents of mixed quality, making data filtering essential. A popular method
is Classifier-based Quality Filtering (CQF), which trains a binary classifier
to distinguish between pretraining data and a small, high-quality set. It
assigns each pretraining document a quality score defined as the classifier's
score and retains only the top-scoring ones. We provide an in-depth analysis of
CQF. We show that while CQF improves downstream task performance, it does not
necessarily enhance language modeling on the high-quality dataset. We explain
this paradox by the fact that CQF implicitly filters the high-quality dataset
as well. We further compare the behavior of models trained with CQF to those
trained on synthetic data of increasing quality, obtained via random token
permutations, and find starkly different trends. Our results challenge the view
that CQF captures a meaningful notion of data quality.

Abstract: Agent-based models used in scenario planning for transportation and urban
planning usually require detailed population information from the base as well
as target scenarios. These populations are usually provided by synthesizing
fake agents through deterministic population synthesis methods. However, these
deterministic population synthesis methods face several challenges, such as
handling high-dimensional data, scalability, and zero-cell issues, particularly
when generating populations for target scenarios. This research looks into how
a deep generative model called Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial
Network (CT-GAN) can be used to create target populations either directly from
a collection of marginal constraints or through a hybrid method that combines
CT-GAN with Fitness-based Synthesis Combinatorial Optimization (FBS-CO). The
research evaluates the proposed population synthesis models against travel
survey and zonal-level aggregated population data. Results indicate that the
stand-alone CT-GAN model performs the best when compared with FBS-CO and the
hybrid model. CT-GAN by itself can create realistic-looking groups that match
single-variable distributions, but it struggles to maintain relationships
between multiple variables. However, the hybrid model demonstrates improved
performance compared to FBS-CO by leveraging CT-GAN ability to generate a
descriptive base population, which is then refined using FBS-CO to align with
target-year marginals. This study demonstrates that CT-GAN represents an
effective methodology for target populations and highlights how deep generative
models can be successfully integrated with conventional synthesis techniques to
enhance their performance.

TL;DR: GreenLightningAI (GLAI) 是一种新型架构模块，通过分离结构知识和定量知识来替代传统MLP，能减少约40%训练时间，同时保持或超越MLP的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MLP在训练过程中将结构知识和定量知识纠缠在一起，导致训练效率不高。GLAI旨在分离这两种知识，实现更高效的训练过程。

Method: GLAI将MLP重新表述为路径组合，固定稳定后的结构（由ReLU激活模式决定），仅优化定量组件（权重和偏置）。

Result: 在多种实验设置中，GLAI平均减少约40%训练时间，同时保持或超越同等参数数量MLP的准确率，收敛速度更快。

Conclusion: GLAI确立了一种新的设计原则，可作为通用模块替代MLP，未来有望集成到Transformer等大规模架构中，降低计算开销。

Abstract: In this work we introduce GreenLightningAI (GLAI), a new architectural block
designed as an alternative to conventional MLPs. The central idea is to
separate two types of knowledge that are usually entangled during training: (i)
*structural knowledge*, encoded by the stable activation patterns induced by
ReLU activations; and (ii) *quantitative knowledge*, carried by the numerical
weights and biases. By fixing the structure once stabilized, GLAI reformulates
the MLP as a combination of paths, where only the quantitative component is
optimized. This reformulation retains the universal approximation capabilities
of MLPs, yet achieves a more efficient training process, reducing training time
by ~40% on average across the cases examined in this study. Crucially, GLAI is
not just another classifier, but a generic block that can replace MLPs wherever
they are used, from supervised heads with frozen backbones to projection layers
in self-supervised learning or few-shot classifiers. Across diverse
experimental setups, GLAI consistently matches or exceeds the accuracy of MLPs
with an equivalent number of parameters, while converging faster. Overall, GLAI
establishes a new design principle that opens a direction for future
integration into large-scale architectures such as Transformers, where MLP
blocks dominate the computational footprint.

Motivation: 研究价值函数方法中不同损失函数对强化学习性能的影响，特别是比较平均绝对误差和均方误差在控制策略次优性差距方面的效果。

Method: 通过理论分析比较不同预测目标（平均绝对误差vs均方误差）对策略性能的影响，并实证验证不同损失函数（交叉熵损失vs平方损失）在强化学习中的表现。

Result: 理论证明平均绝对误差是比均方误差更好的预测目标，能更好地控制策略的次优性差距。实证结果显示基于交叉熵损失的算法在线性强化学习中优于基于平方损失的算法。

Conclusion: 在价值函数方法中，使用平均绝对误差作为预测目标并配合交叉熵损失函数，可以获得比传统均方误差方法更好的强化学习性能。

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of the loss function in value-based
methods for reinforcement learning through an analysis of underlying prediction
objectives. We theoretically show that mean absolute error is a better
prediction objective than the traditional mean squared error for controlling
the learned policy's suboptimality gap. Furthermore, we present results that
different loss functions are better aligned with these different regression
objectives: binary and categorical cross-entropy losses with the mean absolute
error and squared loss with the mean squared error. We then provide empirical
evidence that algorithms minimizing these cross-entropy losses can outperform
those based on the squared loss in linear reinforcement learning.

Method: 开发Boruta-mRMR混合特征选择方法，在25个公开基因表达数据集上使用SVM、随机森林、XGBoost和GBM分类器进行实验

Result: Boruta-mRMR组合相比单独使用mRMR减少了特征数量，加快了训练速度，同时保持或提高了分类准确率

Conclusion: 该方法在多类基因表达数据分析中展现出准确性、稳定性和实用性的明显优势

Abstract: Feature selection is a crucial step in analyzing gene expression data,
enhancing classification performance, and reducing computational costs for
high-dimensional datasets. This paper proposes BoMGene, a hybrid feature
selection method that effectively integrates two popular techniques: Boruta and
Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR). The method aims to optimize the
feature space and enhance classification accuracy. Experiments were conducted
on 25 publicly available gene expression datasets, employing widely used
classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, XGBoost (XGB),
and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM). The results show that using the
Boruta-mRMR combination cuts down the number of features chosen compared to
just using mRMR, which helps to speed up training time while keeping or even
improving classification accuracy compared to using individual feature
selection methods. The proposed approach demonstrates clear advantages in
accuracy, stability, and practical applicability for multi-class gene
expression data analysis

TL;DR: 提出了RiskPO方法，用风险度量替代传统的均值目标，通过混合风险价值目标增强对困难样本的梯度信号，防止过度自信收敛，在数学推理、多模态推理和代码生成任务上显著优于GRPO方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于均值的强化学习方法（如GRPO）存在熵崩溃和推理能力提升有限的问题，主要原因是过度关注高概率输出序列而忽略了罕见但信息丰富的推理路径。

Method: 提出RiskPO方法：1）使用混合风险价值目标替代经典均值目标，对奖励分布的多个区域进行加权关注；2）设计捆绑方案，将多个问题聚合成捆绑包，丰富反馈信号；3）理论证明风险规避更新能缓解熵崩溃并促进探索。

Result: 在数学推理、多模态推理和代码生成基准测试中，RiskPO在Pass@1和Pass@k指标上均一致且显著优于GRPO及其变体。

Conclusion: 基于风险的优化为增强LLM推理能力提供了一个严谨有效的范式。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable reward has recently emerged as a
central paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs); however,
prevailing mean-based methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), suffer from entropy collapse and limited reasoning gains. We argue that
these issues stem from overemphasizing high-probability output sequences while
neglecting rare but informative reasoning paths. To address these challenges,
we propose Risk-based Policy Optimization (RiskPO), which substitutes classical
mean-based objectives with principled risk measures. Specifically, we introduce
a Mixed Value-at-Risk objective that integrates weighted attention over
multiple regions of the reward distribution, thereby amplifying gradient
signals on challenging instances and preventing overconfident convergence. We
further design a bundling scheme that aggregates multiple questions into
bundles, thus enriching the feedback signal and yielding more stable and
informative training dynamics. Theoretically, we prove that the risk-averse
update alleviates entropy collapse and promotes exploration. Numerically,
RiskPO achieves consistent and significant improvements in mathematical
reasoning, multi-modal reasoning, and code generation benchmarks, surpassing
GRPO and its variants on both Pass@1 and Pass@k metrics. Our results
demonstrate that risk-based optimization provides a rigorous and effective
paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出两种校正算法（向后和向前校正）来处理验证器不可靠性问题，通过建模验证器为具有不对称噪声率的随机奖励通道，在RLVR训练中减少假阴性和假阳性错误的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在强化学习与可验证奖励（RLVR）系统中，为避免昂贵的人工标注而使用自动验证器，但验证器存在假阴性和假阳性错误，影响训练效果。

Method: 建模验证器为随机奖励通道，提出向后校正（去偏观测二元奖励）和向前校正（重加权得分函数项）两种算法，并在GRPO-based RLVR流水线中实现。

Result: 在数学推理模型和基准测试中，两种校正方法均优于未校正训练，向前校正收敛更快且在更重噪声下保持稳定。

Conclusion: 通过轻量级LLM验证器在线估计假阴性率，实现了优于其他最先进方法的性能，验证了所提校正方法的有效性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) trains policies against
automated verifiers to avoid costly human labeling. To reduce vulnerability to
verifier hacking, many RLVR systems collapse rewards to binary $\{0,1\}$ during
training. This choice carries a cost: it introduces \textit{false negatives}
(rejecting correct answers, FNs) and \textit{false positives} (accepting
incorrect ones, FPs). For instance, a rule-based checker may mark the correct
fraction $\frac{12}{36}$ as wrong when compared against the canonical
$\frac{1}{3}$ due to brittle parsing/equivalence rules (FN), while a large
language model (LLM) judges can be gamed by superficial cues or even a single
adversarial token, yielding inflated correctness for wrong solutions (FP). We
formalize verifier unreliability by modeling the verifier as a stochastic
reward channel with asymmetric noise rates. From this abstraction, we derive
two correction algorithms for verifier errors. The first is a \textit{backward}
correction that de-biases the observed binary reward to recover an
\textit{unbiased} estimator of the clean policy gradient. The second is a
\textit{forward} correction that reweights score-function terms so that the
expected update direction aligns with the \textit{clean gradient}; notably, it
requires only the FN rate. We implement both as lightweight hooks in a group
relative policy optimization (GRPO)-based RLVR pipeline and evaluate them on
math-reasoning models and benchmarks. Across models and datasets, both
corrections improve over uncorrected training; the forward variant converges
faster and remains stable under heavier noise. Finally, we show a practical
appeal mechanism in which a lightweight LLM verifier estimates the FN rate
online by rechecking rule-based negatives, obtaining outperformance compared
with other state-of-the-art contenders.

TL;DR: RECAP是一种通过强化学习的方法，在模型后训练阶段显式教导模型覆盖有缺陷的推理轨迹，重新路由到安全有帮助的响应，从而提升安全对齐和越狱鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型虽然通过生成结构化思维链进行推理，但在安全对齐方面缺乏批判性推理能力，容易在有缺陷的前提注入到思维过程中时产生偏见。

Method: 使用基于强化学习的后训练方法，在合成生成的反对齐思维链预填充和标准提示的混合数据上进行训练，无需额外训练成本或修改标准RLHF。

Result: 显著提高了安全性和越狱鲁棒性，减少了过度拒绝，同时保持了核心推理能力，且在推理时不会增加token预算。

Conclusion: RECAP训练后的模型更频繁地进行自我反思，在自适应攻击下保持鲁棒性，即使在重复尝试覆盖其推理的情况下也能保持安全性。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) "think" by generating structured
chain-of-thought (CoT) before producing a final answer, yet they still lack the
ability to reason critically about safety alignment and are easily biased when
a flawed premise is injected into their thought process. We propose RECAP
(Robust Safety Alignment via Counter-Aligned Prefilling), a principled
reinforcement learning (RL) method for post-training that explicitly teaches
models to override flawed reasoning trajectories and reroute to safe and
helpful responses. RECAP trains on a mixture of synthetically generated
counter-aligned CoT prefills and standard prompts, requires no additional
training cost or modifications beyond vanilla reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), and substantially improves safety and jailbreak robustness,
reduces overrefusal, and preserves core reasoning capability -- all while
maintaining inference token budget. Extensive analysis shows that RECAP-trained
models engage in self-reflection more frequently and remain robust under
adaptive attacks, preserving safety even after repeated attempts to override
their reasoning.

Motivation: 挑战GRPO需要大组规模以确保稳定训练的假设，通过将其重新定义为对比学习来揭示与DPO的基本联系，探索最小配置的可行性以减少计算开销。

Method: 将GRPO重新定义为对比学习形式，建立与DPO的理论联系，提出并分析仅需2个rollout的最小配置(2-GRPO)。

Result: 2-GRPO在性能上与16-GRPO相当，但仅使用1/8的rollout数量，训练时间减少超过70%。

Conclusion: GRPO的最小配置(2-GRPO)是可行的，能够显著减少计算开销而不牺牲性能，为大型语言模型的后训练提供了更高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a prominent reinforcement
learning algorithm for post-training Large Language Models (LLMs). It is
commonly believed that GRPO necessitates a large group size to ensure stable
training via precise statistical estimation, which incurs substantial
computational overhead. In this work, we challenge this assumption by reframing
GRPO as a form of contrastive learning, which reveals a fundamental connection
to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Motivated by DPO's empirical success,
we investigate the minimal two-rollout case (2-GRPO), a configuration
previously deemed infeasible. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis to
validate 2-GRPO and demonstrate empirically that it achieves performance on par
with 16-GRPO, despite using only 1/8 of the rollouts and reducing training time
by over 70%.

Conclusion: RCM成功地将一致性建模扩展到黎曼流形，为弯曲几何上的生成建模提供了新方法。

Abstract: Consistency models are a class of generative models that enable few-step
generation for diffusion and flow matching models. While consistency models
have achieved promising results on Euclidean domains like images, their
applications to Riemannian manifolds remain challenging due to the curved
geometry. In this work, we propose the Riemannian Consistency Model (RCM),
which, for the first time, enables few-step consistency modeling while
respecting the intrinsic manifold constraint imposed by the Riemannian
geometry. Leveraging the covariant derivative and exponential-map-based
parameterization, we derive the closed-form solutions for both discrete- and
continuous-time training objectives for RCM. We then demonstrate theoretical
equivalence between the two variants of RCM: Riemannian consistency
distillation (RCD) that relies on a teacher model to approximate the marginal
vector field, and Riemannian consistency training (RCT) that utilizes the
conditional vector field for training. We further propose a simplified training
objective that eliminates the need for the complicated differential
calculation. Finally, we provide a unique kinematics perspective for
interpreting the RCM objective, offering new theoretical angles. Through
extensive experiments, we manifest the superior generative quality of RCM in
few-step generation on various non-Euclidean manifolds, including flat-tori,
spheres, and the 3D rotation group SO(3).

Conclusion: 首次为误差约束的逻辑回归测试提供了无遗憾保证，在医疗筛查中具有直接应用价值，仿真验证了理论保证和实际效果。

Abstract: We study the problem of sequentially testing individuals for a binary disease
outcome whose true risk is governed by an unknown logistic model. At each
round, a patient arrives with feature vector $x_t$, and the decision maker may
either pay to administer a (noiseless) diagnostic test--revealing the true
label--or skip testing and predict the patient's disease status based on their
feature vector and prior history. Our goal is to minimize the total number of
costly tests required while guaranteeing that the fraction of
misclassifications does not exceed a prespecified error tolerance $\alpha$,
with probability at least $1-\delta$. To address this, we develop a novel
algorithm that interleaves label-collection and distribution estimation to
estimate both $\theta^{*}$ and the context distribution $P$, and computes a
conservative, data-driven threshold $\tau_t$ on the logistic score
$|x_t^\top\theta|$ to decide when testing is necessary. We prove that, with
probability at least $1-\delta$, our procedure does not exceed the target
misclassification rate, and requires only $O(\sqrt{T})$ excess tests compared
to the oracle baseline that knows both $\theta^{*}$ and the patient feature
distribution $P$. This establishes the first no-regret guarantees for
error-constrained logistic testing, with direct applications to cost-sensitive
medical screening. Simulations corroborate our theoretical guarantees, showing
that in practice our procedure efficiently estimates $\theta^{*}$ while
retaining safety guarantees, and does not require too many excess tests.

Conclusion: 本文不仅解释了无意义token带来益处的机制，还提出了简单有效的ARM技术来利用激活重分布进一步提升LLM性能。

Abstract: Motivated by the puzzling observation that inserting long sequences of
meaningless tokens before the query prompt can consistently enhance LLM
reasoning performance, this work analyzes the underlying mechanism driving this
phenomenon and based on these insights proposes a more principled method that
allows for similar performance gains. First, we find that the improvements
arise from a redistribution of activations in the LLM's MLP layers, where near
zero activations become less frequent while large magnitude activations
increase. This redistribution enhances the model's representational capacity by
suppressing weak signals and promoting stronger, more informative ones.
Building on this insight, we propose the Activation Redistribution Module
(ARM), a lightweight inference-time technique that modifies activations
directly without altering the input sequence. ARM adaptively identifies
near-zero activations after the non-linear function and shifts them outward,
implicitly reproducing the beneficial effects of meaningless tokens in a
controlled manner. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and model
architectures clearly show that ARM consistently improves LLM performance on
reasoning tasks while requiring only a few lines of simple code to implement.
Our findings deliver both a clear mechanistic explanation for the unexpected
benefits of meaningless tokens and a simple yet effective technique that
harnesses activation redistribution to further improve LLM performance.

Conclusion: CurES方法通过系统化的理论分析和贝叶斯优化策略，显著提高了大语言模型在推理任务上的训练效率和收敛速度。

Abstract: Curriculum learning plays a crucial role in enhancing the training efficiency
of large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks. However, existing methods
often fail to adequately account for variations in prompt difficulty or rely on
simplistic filtering mechanisms to select prompt datasets within a narrow
criterion range, resulting in significant computational waste. In this work, we
approach the problem from the perspective of reinforcement learning gradient
optimization, offering a systematic and theoretical investigation into how to
improve the training efficiency of LLMs. We identify two key factors
influencing training efficiency: the selection of training prompts and the
allocation of rollout quantities across different prompts. Our theoretical
analysis reveals that the sampling distribution of prompts dictates the
convergence rate of gradient descent, while the allocation of the rollout
quantity influences the consistency and stability of overall gradient updates.
Based on these insights, we propose CurES, an efficient training method that
accelerates convergence and employs Bayesian posterior estimation to minimize
computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that our CurES outperforms
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) by \textbf{+3.30} points and
\textbf{+4.82} points with 1.5B and 7B models, respectively. Additionally,
CurES exhibits faster convergence compared to baselines, including GRPO.

TL;DR: 提出了Gated X-TFC方法，通过软学习域分解解决PINNs在边界层问题中的梯度分辨率不足问题，显著提高计算效率和精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PINNs和相关方法在解决奇异扰动边界值问题时难以解析尖锐梯度，而X-TFC虽然避免了多目标优化但计算效率低且不兼容域分解。

Method: 使用可微分的逻辑门进行软学习域分解，动态调整RBF核宽度，无需界面惩罚；引入算子条件元学习层学习PDE参数到最优门配置的概率映射。

Result: 在1D对流扩散基准测试中，Gated X-TFC比标准X-TFC误差降低一个数量级，使用80%更少的配点，训练时间减少66%；可扩展到多子域和高维问题。

Conclusion: Gated X-TFC为PINNs提供了一个简单替代方案，在具有挑战性的边界层区域既准确又计算高效。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and related methods struggle to
resolve sharp gradients in singularly perturbed boundary value problems without
resorting to some form of domain decomposition, which often introduce complex
interface penalties. While the Extreme Theory of Functional Connections (X-TFC)
avoids multi-objective optimization by employing exact boundary condition
enforcement, it remains computationally inefficient for boundary layers and
incompatible with decomposition. We propose Gated X-TFC, a novel framework for
both forward and inverse problems, that overcomes these limitations through a
soft, learned domain decomposition. Our method replaces hard interfaces with a
differentiable logistic gate that dynamically adapts radial basis function
(RBF) kernel widths across the domain, eliminating the need for interface
penalties. This approach yields not only superior accuracy but also dramatic
improvements in computational efficiency: on a benchmark one dimensional (1D)
convection-diffusion, Gated X-TFC achieves an order-of-magnitude lower error
than standard X-TFC while using 80 percent fewer collocation points and
reducing training time by 66 percent. In addition, we introduce an
operator-conditioned meta-learning layer that learns a probabilistic mapping
from PDE parameters to optimal gate configurations, enabling fast,
uncertainty-aware warm-starting for new problem instances. We further
demonstrate scalability to multiple subdomains and higher dimensions by solving
a twin boundary-layer equation and a 2D Poisson problem with a sharp Gaussian
source. Overall, Gated X-TFC delivers a simple alternative alternative to PINNs
that is both accurate and computationally efficient for challenging

TL;DR: GEM是一个为LLM设计的开源环境模拟器，类似于OpenAI-Gym在传统强化学习中的作用，提供标准化环境-代理接口、多样化环境套件和基准测试工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的训练范式正从静态数据集转向基于经验的学习，需要复杂环境交互来获取技能，因此需要标准化环境框架来促进这一转变。

Method: 开发GEM框架，包括异步向量化执行以提高吞吐量、灵活包装器便于扩展、多样化环境套件、集成工具以及与五个流行RL训练框架的示例脚本。

Result: 提供了24个环境的基准测试，使用ReBN的REINFORCE方法，并在单轮和多轮设置中对PPO、GRPO和REINFORCE进行了公平比较。

Conclusion: GEM作为训练环境和评估工具包，有望加速未来智能LLM代理的研究发展。

Abstract: The training paradigm for large language models (LLMs) is moving from static
datasets to experience-based learning, where agents acquire skills via
interacting with complex environments. To facilitate this transition we
introduce GEM (General Experience Maker), an open-source environment simulator
designed for the age of LLMs. Analogous to OpenAI-Gym for traditional
reinforcement learning (RL), GEM provides a standardized framework for the
environment-agent interface, including asynchronous vectorized execution for
high throughput, and flexible wrappers for easy extensibility. GEM also
features a diverse suite of environments, robust integrated tools, and
single-file example scripts demonstrating using GEM with five popular RL
training frameworks. Along with this, we also provide a set of baselines across
24 environments using REINFORCE with Return Batch Normalization (ReBN), which
-- unlike GRPO -- is compatible with the full RL setting of dense per-turn
rewards and offers better credit assignment. We further conduct apple-to-apple
benchmarking of PPO, GRPO and REINFORCE in both single- and multi-turn settings
using GEM to shed light on the algorithmic designs. Lastly, GEM also functions
as a convenient evaluation toolkit besides a training environment. We hope this
framework can help accelerate future agentic LLM research.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了秘密诱导技术，旨在发现AI拥有但不会明确表达的知识。通过训练三种大语言模型家族，让它们掌握特定知识但在被直接询问时否认，然后设计了多种黑盒和白盒技术来诱导这些秘密知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI系统拥有但不明确表达的知识如何被诱导出来，这对于AI审计和安全性评估具有重要意义。

Method: 训练三种LLM家族掌握特定知识但在直接询问时否认，然后设计黑盒（如前缀攻击）和白盒（如logit lens和稀疏自编码器）技术来诱导秘密知识。

Result: 大多数技术比简单基线有所改进，前缀攻击在2/3场景中最有效，白盒技术在剩余场景中最有效。

Conclusion: 建立了秘密诱导的公共基准，表明不同技术在不同场景下各有优势，为AI知识审计提供了有效方法。

Abstract: We study secret elicitation: discovering knowledge that an AI possesses but
does not explicitly verbalize. As a testbed, we train three families of large
language models (LLMs) to possess specific knowledge that they apply downstream
but deny knowing when asked directly. For example, in one setting, we train an
LLM to generate replies that are consistent with knowing the user is female,
while denying this knowledge when asked directly. We then design various
black-box and white-box secret elicitation techniques and evaluate them based
on whether they can help an LLM auditor successfully guess the secret
knowledge. Many of our techniques improve on simple baselines. Our most
effective techniques (performing best in 2/3 settings) are based on prefill
attacks, a black-box technique where the LLM reveals secret knowledge when
generating a completion from a predefined prefix. In our remaining setting,
white-box techniques based on logit lens and sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are
most effective. We release our models and code, establishing a public benchmark
for evaluating secret elicitation methods.

Motivation: 糖尿病视网膜病变是工作年龄成年人失明的主要原因，当前基于图像的AI工具在早期检测方面存在局限性，需要替代方法。

Method: 使用两级集成模型：第一阶段对基础模型进行超参数调优并在不同配置下内部堆叠；第二阶段使用随机森林作为元学习器聚合预测结果。

Result: 模型在多个指标上表现优异：准确率0.9433、F1分数0.9425、召回率0.9207、精确率0.9653、ROC-AUC 0.9844、AUPRC 0.9875。

Conclusion: 该模型展示了在临床环境中进行准确且可解释的糖尿病视网膜病变风险预测的潜力。

Abstract: Preprint Note: This is the author preprint version of a paper accepted for
presentation at the IISE Annual Conference & Expo 2025. The final version will
appear in the official proceedings.
  Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness in working-age
adults, and current diagnostic methods rely on resource-intensive eye exams and
specialized equipment. Image-based AI tools have shown limitations in
early-stage detection, motivating the need for alternative approaches. We
propose a non-image-based, two-level ensemble model for DR prediction using
routine laboratory test results. In the first stage, base models (Linear SVC,
Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost) are hyperparameter tuned and
internally stacked across different configurations to optimize metrics such as
accuracy, recall, and precision. In the second stage, predictions are
aggregated using Random Forest as a meta-learner. This hierarchical stacking
strategy improves generalization, balances performance across multiple metrics,
and remains computationally efficient compared to deep learning approaches. The
model achieved Accuracy 0.9433, F1 Score 0.9425, Recall 0.9207, Precision
0.9653, ROC-AUC 0.9844, and AUPRC 0.9875, surpassing one-level stacking and FCN
baselines. These results highlight the model potential for accurate and
interpretable DR risk prediction in clinical settings.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的多演员多评论家深度确定性强化学习方法，通过非支配排序选择演员进行探索，使用分位数集成策略评估演员和评论家，并在复杂问题上表现出优于现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习方法在处理大规模离散或连续状态/动作空间时面临挑战，虽然已有研究使用多个评论家来解决高估和低估问题，但很少有研究考虑同时使用多个演员和多个评论家的架构。

Method: 提出MAMC方法，包含三个主要特征：基于非支配排序的演员选择（考虑技能和创造力因素）、使用分位数集成策略评估演员和评论家、利用具有最佳技能因素的演员。

Result: 在MuJoCo基准测试中，该方法优于最先进的深度确定性强化学习方法，实验分析表明所提出的组件是有效的。

Conclusion: 理论分析证明了MAMC的学习稳定性和有界估计偏差，实证分析进一步验证了该方法在复杂问题上的有效性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has gathered much attention in recent years due to its
rapid development and rich applications, especially on control systems and
robotics. When tackling real-world applications with reinforcement learning
method, the corresponded Markov decision process may have huge discrete or even
continuous state/action space. Deep reinforcement learning has been studied for
handling these issues through deep learning for years, and one promising branch
is the actor-critic architecture. Many past studies leveraged multiple critics
to enhance the accuracy of evaluation of a policy for addressing the
overestimation and underestimation issues. However, few studies have considered
the architecture with multiple actors together with multiple critics. This
study proposes a novel multi-actor multi-critic (MAMC) deep deterministic
reinforcement learning method. The proposed method has three main features,
including selection of actors based on non-dominated sorting for exploration
with respect to skill and creativity factors, evaluation for actors and critics
using a quantile-based ensemble strategy, and exploiting actors with best skill
factor. Theoretical analysis proves the learning stability and bounded
estimation bias for the MAMC. The present study examines the performance on a
well-known reinforcement learning benchmark MuJoCo. Experimental results show
that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art deep deterministic
based reinforcement learning methods. Experimental analysis also indicates the
proposed components are effective. Empirical analysis further investigates the
validity of the proposed method, and shows its benefit on complicated problems.

Motivation: 学习观测数据背后的动力系统随机模型在许多科学领域具有重要意义，但现有自编码器方法在随机系统建模方面存在局限性。

Method: 基于变分自编码器框架，同时估计系统状态轨迹和噪声时间序列，支持多步系统演化并采用教师强制策略。

Result: 在六个测试问题（包括模拟和实验数据）上验证了方法性能，展示了教师强制间隔对内部动力学性质的影响，并与等效架构的确定性模型进行了比较。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效学习随机动力系统模型，克服了传统自编码器方法在随机系统建模中的限制。

Abstract: Learning stochastic models of dynamical systems underlying observed data is
of interest in many scientific fields. Here we propose a novel method for this
task, based on the framework of variational autoencoders for dynamical systems.
The method estimates from the data both the system state trajectories and noise
time series. This approach allows to perform multi-step system evolution and
supports a teacher forcing strategy, alleviating limitations of
autoencoder-based approaches for stochastic systems. We demonstrate the
performance of the proposed approach on six test problems, covering simulated
and experimental data. We further show the effects of the teacher forcing
interval on the nature of the internal dynamics, and compare it to the
deterministic models with equivalent architecture.

TL;DR: 本文分析了神经网络回归中的表示几何特性，发现与分类任务中的神经坍缩不同，回归任务中的坍缩会损害性能。通过内在维度分析，揭示了过压缩和欠压缩两种机制对泛化性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然神经坍缩在分类任务中被证明有利于泛化，但回归任务中类似的坍缩现象却会降低性能。本文旨在解释这种差异，并研究回归任务中表示几何对泛化的影响。

Method: 通过内在维度分析，估计最后一层特征的内在维度(ID_H)并与回归目标的内在维度(ID_Y)进行比较。在控制任务和合成数据集上进行实验验证。

Result: 坍缩模型表现为ID_H < ID_Y，导致过压缩和泛化性能差；非坍缩模型通常保持ID_H > ID_Y。性能与ID_H的关系取决于数据量和噪声水平。

Conclusion: 识别了过压缩和欠压缩两种机制，为提升神经网络回归泛化性能提供了新的几何视角和实用策略。

Abstract: Neural multivariate regression underpins a wide range of domains such as
control, robotics, and finance, yet the geometry of its learned representations
remains poorly characterized. While neural collapse has been shown to benefit
generalization in classification, we find that analogous collapse in regression
consistently degrades performance. To explain this contrast, we analyze models
through the lens of intrinsic dimension. Across control tasks and synthetic
datasets, we estimate the intrinsic dimension of last-layer features (ID_H) and
compare it with that of the regression targets (ID_Y). Collapsed models exhibit
ID_H < ID_Y, leading to over-compression and poor generalization, whereas
non-collapsed models typically maintain ID_H > ID_Y. For the non-collapsed
models, performance with respect to ID_H depends on the data quantity and noise
levels. From these observations, we identify two regimes (over-compressed and
under-compressed) that determine when expanding or reducing feature
dimensionality improves performance. Our results provide new geometric insights
into neural regression and suggest practical strategies for enhancing
generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间序列模型无法处理文本信息，而LLM在处理数值时间序列时效率低下且缺乏时间数据预训练经验，需要弥合这一能力差距。

Method: 使用补丁式编码器-解码器架构增强LLM，在超过200万个交织的时间序列和文本示例上进行训练，涵盖多种分析任务。

Result: TsLLM在需要时间序列分析与自然语言整合的任务上表现出色，虽然不旨在超越专业模型，但提供了现有方法无法提供的能力。

Conclusion: 建立了一个新的时间序列分析范式，通过自然语言交互弥合数值计算与自然语言理解之间的鸿沟，使复杂的时间推理能力更加普及。

Abstract: Time series data is fundamental to decision-making in many crucial domains
including healthcare, finance, and environmental science. However, analyzing
this data often requires incorporating unstructured contextual information,
answering domain-specific questions, and generating natural language
explanations -- capabilities that traditional time series models lack due to
their inability to process text. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at
contextual reasoning and knowledge integration, they struggle with numerical
time series due to inefficient text-based representations and limited exposure
to temporal data during pretraining. We address this gap by augmenting an LLM
with specialized time series perception through a patch-based encoder-decoder
architecture. We train this Time Series-augmented LLM (TsLLM) on a large corpus
of over 2 million interleaved time series and text examples spanning diverse
analysis tasks: forecasting with contextual information, time series
question-answering, pattern explanation, classification with natural language
outputs, and report generation. This training enables TsLLM to leverage both
its language understanding and newly acquired temporal reasoning capabilities.
While not designed to surpass specialized models on traditional benchmarks,
TsLLM demonstrates strong performance on tasks requiring the integration of
time series analysis with natural language -- capabilities that existing
approaches cannot provide. Our work establishes a new paradigm for time series
analysis that bridges numerical computation and natural language understanding,
democratizing access to sophisticated temporal reasoning through natural
language interaction.

Motivation: 生物特征数据敏感，集中式训练存在隐私风险，而传统联邦学习在处理异构数据和可解释性方面存在困难。

Method: 在中央服务器添加注意力机制，根据重要性加权本地模型更新；使用Siamese-CNN提取特征；结合差分隐私和安全更新协议保护数据。

Result: 在FVC2004指纹数据上，A3-FL准确率达0.8413，优于FedAvg(0.8164)、Local-only(0.7664)和Centralized(0.7997)；即使使用差分隐私，准确率仍保持0.8330。

Conclusion: A3-FL框架为分布式环境提供了可扩展、隐私敏感的生物特征识别系统，实现了安全有效的识别。

Abstract: Because biometric data is sensitive, centralized training poses a privacy
risk, even though biometric recognition is essential for contemporary
applications. Federated learning (FL), which permits decentralized training,
provides a privacy-preserving substitute. Conventional FL, however, has trouble
with interpretability and heterogeneous data (non-IID). In order to handle
non-IID biometric data, this framework adds an attention mechanism at the
central server that weights local model updates according to their
significance. Differential privacy and secure update protocols safeguard data
while preserving accuracy. The A3-FL framework is evaluated in this study using
FVC2004 fingerprint data, with each client's features extracted using a Siamese
Convolutional Neural Network (Siamese-CNN). By dynamically modifying client
contributions, the attention mechanism increases the accuracy of the global
model.The accuracy, convergence speed, and robustness of the A3-FL framework
are superior to those of standard FL (FedAvg) and static baselines, according
to experimental evaluations using fingerprint data (FVC2004). The accuracy of
the attention-based approach was 0.8413, while FedAvg, Local-only, and
Centralized approaches were 0.8164, 0.7664, and 0.7997, respectively. Accuracy
stayed high at 0.8330 even with differential privacy. A scalable and
privacy-sensitive biometric system for secure and effective recognition in
dispersed environments is presented in this work.

Motivation: 当前时间序列模型缺乏多步推理能力，无法执行反事实分析、逻辑推理等复杂推理过程，而LLM在时间序列任务上表现不佳

Method: 使用残差向量量化VAE创建高保真离散token，集成到预训练LLM词汇表中；采用两阶段训练：监督微调掌握新表示，然后使用群组相对策略优化进行强化学习训练

Result: RL驱动的中间CoT推理方法显著提升了LLM在各种时间序列分析任务上的性能

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂时间序列数据推理开辟了新可能性

Abstract: Complex numerical time series analysis often demands multi-step reasoning
capabilities beyond current models' reach. Tasks like medical diagnosis and
weather forecasting require sequential reasoning processes -- including
counterfactual analysis, logical deduction, knowledge application, and
multi-modal contextual integration -- that existing time series models cannot
explicitly perform. While recent research has shown large language models
(LLMs) can achieve sophisticated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning through
reinforcement learning (RL), these advances have primarily focused on
mathematical and coding domains, with LLMs still demonstrating poor performance
on time series tasks. We introduce Chain Of thought for Understanding Numerical
Time Series (COUNTS), the first framework that trains LLMs to perform CoT
reasoning across diverse time series tasks using RL with verifiable rewards.
Our approach employs a Residual Vector-Quantized VAE to create high-fidelity
discrete tokens that seamlessly integrate into a pre-trained LLM's vocabulary.
COUNTS undergoes a two-stage training process: first, supervised fine-tuning on
time series analysis tasks to master our novel representations, followed by
Group Relative Policy Optimization training on verifiable problems using
prompting strategies that encourage explicit reasoning steps before producing
final answers. Our experiments demonstrate that this RL-driven approach with
intermediate CoT reasoning significantly enhances LLM performance across
various time series analysis tasks, opening new possibilities for complex
temporal data reasoning.

Result: 实验评估表明该方法能有效捕捉重要的序列相关性，并提高分类准确性

Conclusion: 通过将序列映射到双曲面空间并利用双曲面特征向量的内积来测量序列相似性，能够更好地分析生物序列关系

Abstract: Genomic sequence analysis plays a crucial role in various scientific and
medical domains. Traditional machine-learning approaches often struggle to
capture the complex relationships and hierarchical structures of sequence data
when working in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces. This limitation hinders
accurate sequence classification and similarity measurement. To address these
challenges, this research proposes a method to transform the feature
representation of biological sequences into the hyperboloid space. By applying
a transformation, the sequences are mapped onto the hyperboloid, preserving
their inherent structural information. Once the sequences are represented in
the hyperboloid space, a kernel matrix is computed based on the hyperboloid
features. The kernel matrix captures the pairwise similarities between
sequences, enabling more effective analysis of biological sequence
relationships. This approach leverages the inner product of the hyperboloid
feature vectors to measure the similarity between pairs of sequences. The
experimental evaluation of the proposed approach demonstrates its efficacy in
capturing important sequence correlations and improving classification
accuracy.

Motivation: 解决长链思维推理训练导致的上下文长度膨胀、计算成本增加和答案延迟问题，探索在帕累托前沿上获得更好准确率与更低延迟/成本的组合。

Method: Parallel-Distill-Refine (PDR)方法：并行生成多样化草稿，蒸馏到有界文本工作空间，基于工作空间进行精炼。还训练了8B思考模型与PDR推理方法保持一致。

Result: 在数学任务上，PDR方法比长链思维获得更高准确率（AIME 2024 +11%，AIME 2025 +9%），同时降低延迟。顺序精炼(SR)也优于长链思维。

Conclusion: 模型编排方法如PDR可以显著提升性能，进一步训练可以改变帕累托前沿，迭代流水线在匹配顺序预算下超越单次推理基线。

Abstract: Reasoning training incentivizes LLMs to produce long chains of thought (long
CoT), which among other things, allows them to explore solution strategies with
self-checking. This results in higher accuracy, but inflates context length,
token/compute cost, and answer latency. We ask: Can current models leverage
their metacognition to provide other combinations on this Pareto frontier,
e.g., better accuracy with lower context length and/or latency? Abstractly, we
view the model as an improvement operator on its own "thoughts" with a
continuum of possible strategies. We identify an interesting inference family
Parallel-Distill-Refine (PDR), which performs the following: (i) generate
diverse drafts in parallel; (ii) distill them into a bounded, textual
workspace; and (iii) refine conditioned on this workspace, producing an output
that seeds the next round. Importantly, context length (hence compute cost) is
controllable via degree of parallelism, and is no longer conflated with the
total number of generated tokens. We report PDR instantiations of current
models that give better accuracy than long CoT while incurring lower latency.
Setting degree of parallelism to 1 yields an interesting subcase, Sequential
Refinement (SR) (iteratively improve a single candidate answer) which provides
performance superior to long CoT. Success of such model orchestrations raises
the question whether further training could shift the Pareto frontier. To this
end, we train an 8B thinking model with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to make it
consistent with PDR as the inference method. On math tasks with verifiable
answers, iterative pipelines surpass single-pass baselines at matched
sequential budgets, with PDR delivering the largest gains (e.g., +11% on AIME
2024 and +9% on AIME 2025).

Abstract: We study what actually works and what doesn't for training large language
models as agents via multi-turn reinforcement learning. Despite rapid progress,
existing frameworks and definitions are fragmented, and there is no systematic
formulation or analysis of which design choices matter across tasks. We address
this gap by first breaking down the design space into three inter-related
pillars -- environment, reward, and policy -- and empirically derive a recipe
for training LLM agents in situated textual domains. In particular, we test
TextWorld and ALFWorld, popular domains for testing situated embodied
reasoning, as well as SWE-Gym for more software engineering style tasks. (i)
For the environment, we analyze the impacts of task complexity in terms of
sizes of the state and action spaces as well as optimal solution length,
finding that even simple environments within a domain can provide signal on how
well an agent can generalize to more complex tasks. (ii) For the reward, we
ablate relative reward sparsity, observing that while dense turn-level rewards
accelerate training, performance and stability is highly dependent on the
choice of RL algorithm. (iii) And for the agent's policy, we explore the
interplay between reward sparsity and biased (PPO, GRPO) and unbiased (RLOO)
policy gradient methods in addition to showing how to find the optimal
Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) to RL training ratio given a fixed budget. We
distill these findings into a training recipe that guides co-design across the
three pillars, facilitating research and practical efforts in multi-turn
agentic RL. Code: https://github.com/pearls-lab/meow-tea-taro

Motivation: 后训练LLMs通过强化学习对批处理和提示选择策略敏感，需要找到平衡生成效率和梯度质量的最佳训练方法。

Method: PCL使用并发更新的价值模型以在线方式识别当前策略的中等难度提示，专注于产生高有效比的信息性提示。

Result: PCL在MATH和DeepScaleR上分别实现12.1倍和16.9倍的提示识别速度提升，达到最高性能或显著减少达到同等性能所需时间。

Conclusion: PCL为推理导向的强化学习提供了在性能上限和效率之间更好权衡的新方法。

Abstract: We introduce Prompt Curriculum Learning (PCL), a lightweight reinforcement
learning (RL) algorithm that selects intermediate-difficulty prompts using a
learned value model to post-train language models. Since post-training LLMs via
RL remains sensitive to batching and prompt selection strategies, we first
conduct a series of systematic experiments where we (1) determine the optimal
training batch size that balances generation efficiency and gradient quality
and (2) establish the importance of focusing on prompts of intermediate
difficulty for the policy. We build upon these results to design PCL, which
identifies prompts of intermediate difficulty for the current policy in an
on-policy manner by using a value model that is concurrently updated based on
the current policy. By focusing on informative prompts that yield high
effective ratios, PCL achieves either the highest performance or requires
significantly less time to reach comparable performance to its counterparts.
Compared to rollout-based filtering methods, PCL avoids costly rollouts and
achieves $12.1\times$ and $16.9\times$ faster speed on identifying
intermediate-difficulty prompts when training on MATH and DeepScaleR,
respectively. We further demonstrate that our value model accurately predicts
prompt difficulty and allows PCL to focus on progressively more challenging
prompts during RL. Our results present a new methodology that delivers improved
tradeoff between upper-bound performance and efficiency for reasoning-focused
RL.

Motivation: 现实世界表格数据经常不完整，而简单插补策略会引入偏差或扭曲数据分布，因此需要能够提供高质量插补、对数据集大小鲁棒且推理快速的插补方法。

Method: 使用自动解码器架构的隐式神经表示框架，将表格建模为神经函数，引入可学习的行和特征嵌入来处理表格数据的离散结构，支持从部分观测中进行实例自适应插补。

Result: 在12个真实世界数据集和多种缺失机制下评估，显示出持续强大的插补准确性，在大多数情况下匹配或优于经典方法(KNN、MICE、MissForest)和深度学习模型(GAIN、ReMasker)，在高维数据集上优势最明显。

Conclusion: TabINR框架为表格数据插补提供了有效的解决方案，具有高质量插补、鲁棒性和快速推理的优势，特别适用于高维数据集。

Abstract: Tabular data builds the basis for a wide range of applications, yet
real-world datasets are frequently incomplete due to collection errors, privacy
restrictions, or sensor failures. As missing values degrade the performance or
hinder the applicability of downstream models, and while simple imputing
strategies tend to introduce bias or distort the underlying data distribution,
we require imputers that provide high-quality imputations, are robust across
dataset sizes and yield fast inference. We therefore introduce TabINR, an
auto-decoder based Implicit Neural Representation (INR) framework that models
tables as neural functions. Building on recent advances in generalizable INRs,
we introduce learnable row and feature embeddings that effectively deal with
the discrete structure of tabular data and can be inferred from partial
observations, enabling instance adaptive imputations without modifying the
trained model. We evaluate our framework across a diverse range of twelve
real-world datasets and multiple missingness mechanisms, demonstrating
consistently strong imputation accuracy, mostly matching or outperforming
classical (KNN, MICE, MissForest) and deep learning based models (GAIN,
ReMasker), with the clearest gains on high-dimensional datasets.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于随机矩阵理论的梯度去噪后处理算法，用于提高差分隐私微调语言模型的样本效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DP-SGD在提供强隐私保证的同时，增加的噪声破坏了梯度矩阵的低秩结构，显著降低了优化效率

Method: 利用随机矩阵理论对梯度进行去噪后处理，恢复低秩结构并改善与原始信号的对齐

Result: 在GLUE任务上对RoBERTa进行DP-SGD微调时，相比现有方法提高了样本效率，显著减少了达到次优性能所需的训练时间

Conclusion: 矩阵恢复技术可以在不损害隐私保证的前提下，提升私有语言模型训练的实用性

Abstract: We address the challenge of sample efficiency in differentially private
fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) using DP-SGD. While DP-SGD provides
strong privacy guarantees, the added noise significantly increases the entropy
of gradient matrices, disrupting their low-rank structure and slowing
optimization. We propose a post-processing algorithm that leverages random
matrix theory to denoise gradients, restore low-rank structure, and improve
alignment with the original signal. Applied to DP-SGD fine-tuning of RoBERTa on
GLUE tasks, our method improves sample efficiency compared to state-of-the-art
approaches, substantially reducing training time when optimal performance is
not required. This work demonstrates that matrix recovery techniques can
enhance the utility of private language model training without compromising
privacy guarantees.

TL;DR: 提出基于Hamilton-Jacobi方程的最优传输新框架，通过特征线方法推导闭式双向传输映射，无需数值积分，使用单一神经网络训练，消除对抗训练阶段，降低计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统最优传输方法计算复杂且需要数值积分，需要更高效、理论保证且适用于多种成本函数的解决方案。

Method: 基于Hamilton-Jacobi方程的特征线方法，推导闭式双向传输映射，采用纯最小化框架训练单一神经网络，损失函数来自HJ方程的特征线方法。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明该方法具有高精度、可扩展性和效率，支持多种成本函数和类条件传输。

Conclusion: 该方法为最优传输应用提供了理论严谨且通用的工具，具有可证明的最优性。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for solving optimal transport (OT) problems
based on the Hamilton--Jacobi (HJ) equation, whose viscosity solution uniquely
characterizes the OT map. By leveraging the method of characteristics, we
derive closed-form, bidirectional transport maps, thereby eliminating the need
for numerical integration. The proposed method adopts a pure minimization
framework: a single neural network is trained with a loss function derived from
the method of characteristics of the HJ equation. This design guarantees
convergence to the optimal map while eliminating adversarial training stages,
thereby substantially reducing computational complexity. Furthermore, the
framework naturally extends to a wide class of cost functions and supports
class-conditional transport. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets
demonstrate the accuracy, scalability, and efficiency of the proposed method,
establishing it as a principled and versatile tool for OT applications with
provable optimality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多边际轨迹推断方法ALI-CFM，通过对抗性学习拟合神经参数化的插值曲线，解决了在只有离散时间点观测数据时建模动态系统的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在只有离散时间点观测数据而无真实轨迹的情况下，建模动态系统并推断潜在轨迹是一个重要但困难的任务。现有多边际轨迹推断算法存在局限性，需要新的方法来更好地拟合中间时间点的分布。

Method: 使用GAN启发的对抗性损失来拟合源点和目标点之间的神经参数化插值曲线，确保中间时间点的边际分布接近观测分布。然后通过流匹配算法对插值进行边际化，得到底层动态的训练向量场。

Result: 在空间转录组学和细胞追踪数据集上优于现有基线方法，在单细胞轨迹预测任务上与基线方法表现相当。

Conclusion: ALI-CFM方法具有多功能性和可扩展性，能够生成平滑的轨迹，在温和假设下这些插值是唯一的，为只有离散观测数据的动态系统建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Learning the dynamics of a process given sampled observations at several time
points is an important but difficult task in many scientific applications. When
no ground-truth trajectories are available, but one has only snapshots of data
taken at discrete time steps, the problem of modelling the dynamics, and thus
inferring the underlying trajectories, can be solved by multi-marginal
generalisations of flow matching algorithms. This paper proposes a novel flow
matching method that overcomes the limitations of existing multi-marginal
trajectory inference algorithms. Our proposed method, ALI-CFM, uses a
GAN-inspired adversarial loss to fit neurally parametrised interpolant curves
between source and target points such that the marginal distributions at
intermediate time points are close to the observed distributions. The resulting
interpolants are smooth trajectories that, as we show, are unique under mild
assumptions. These interpolants are subsequently marginalised by a flow
matching algorithm, yielding a trained vector field for the underlying
dynamics. We showcase the versatility and scalability of our method by
outperforming the existing baselines on spatial transcriptomics and cell
tracking datasets, while performing on par with them on single-cell trajectory
prediction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: M2PO是一种异步强化学习方法，通过约束重要性权重的二阶矩来抑制极端异常值，同时保留信息性更新，实现了在高延迟数据下的稳定离策略训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法依赖同策略训练，需要每次更新时重新生成数据，效率低下且难以扩展。异步RL系统虽然解耦了数据生成和训练，但在处理高延迟数据时性能会下降或崩溃。

Method: 提出M2PO方法，通过约束重要性权重的二阶矩来抑制极端异常值，同时保留信息性更新。该方法显著减少了高延迟下被裁剪的token比例，精确屏蔽高方差token同时保持优化稳定性。

Result: 在6个模型（1.7B到32B）和8个基准测试上的广泛评估表明，M2PO即使在数据延迟至少256个模型更新的情况下也能实现稳定的离策略训练，并达到同策略性能水平。

Conclusion: M2PO证明了延迟数据如果被适当利用，可以像同策略数据一样具有信息性，为大规模语言模型的高效强化学习训练提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been central to recent advances in large language
model reasoning, but most algorithms rely on on-policy training that demands
fresh rollouts at every update, limiting efficiency and scalability.
Asynchronous RL systems alleviate this by decoupling rollout generation from
training, yet their effectiveness hinges on tolerating large staleness in
rollout data, a setting where existing methods either degrade in performance or
collapse. We revisit this challenge and uncover a prosperity-before-collapse
phenomenon: stale data can be as informative as on-policy data if exploited
properly. Building on this insight, we introduce M2PO (Second-Moment Trust
Policy Optimization), which constrains the second moment of importance weights
to suppress only extreme outliers while preserving informative updates.
Notably, M2PO sharply reduces the fraction of clipped tokens under high
staleness (from 1.22% to 0.06% over training), precisely masking high-variance
tokens while maintaining stable optimization. Extensive evaluation across six
models (from 1.7B to 32B) and eight benchmarks shows that M2PO delivers stable
off-policy training even with data stale by at least 256 model updates and
matches on-policy performance.

Motivation: 尽管上下文学习在大型语言模型中持续有效，但其出现机制仍不清楚。研究旨在阐明预训练分布的统计特性如何塑造上下文学习能力，特别是数值任务上的表现。

Method: 开发了一个统一任务选择和泛化的理论框架，将贝叶斯后验一致性和集中性结果推广到重尾先验和依赖序列，并通过实证研究验证预训练分布对上下文学习性能的影响。

Result: 研究表明预训练分布的统计特性（如尾部行为）对上下文学习的样本效率、任务检索和鲁棒性具有关键影响，特别是在随机微分方程和带记忆随机过程等挑战性任务上。

Conclusion: 控制预训练分布的关键统计特性对于构建具有上下文学习能力和可靠的大型语言模型至关重要。

Abstract: The emergence of in-context learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs)
remains poorly understood despite its consistent effectiveness, enabling models
to adapt to new tasks from only a handful of examples. To clarify and improve
these capabilities, we characterize how the statistical properties of the
pretraining distribution (e.g., tail behavior, coverage) shape ICL on numerical
tasks. We develop a theoretical framework that unifies task selection and
generalization, extending and sharpening earlier results, and show how
distributional properties govern sample efficiency, task retrieval, and
robustness. To this end, we generalize Bayesian posterior consistency and
concentration results to heavy-tailed priors and dependent sequences, better
reflecting the structure of LLM pretraining data. We then empirically study how
ICL performance varies with the pretraining distribution on challenging tasks
such as stochastic differential equations and stochastic processes with memory.
Together, these findings suggest that controlling key statistical properties of
the pretraining distribution is essential for building ICL-capable and reliable
LLMs.

Conclusion: 该框架为多目标对齐提供了有效解决方案，能在保持各目标性能的同时实现细粒度的用户控制。

Abstract: Aligning large language models to human preferences is inherently
multidimensional, yet most pipelines collapse heterogeneous signals into a
single optimizeable objective. We seek to answer what it would take to
simultaneously align a model across various domains spanning those with:
verifiable rewards (mathematical accuracy), non-verifiable subjective
preferences (human values), and complex interactive scenarios (multi-turn AI
tutoring dialogues). Such multi-objective reinforcement learning setups are
often plagued by the individual objectives being at odds with each other,
resulting in inefficient training and little user control during inference. We
propose a unified framework that: (i) standardizes {process reward model} (PRM)
training across both verifiable and non-verifiable settings to better supervise
models' chain-of-thought reasoning; (ii) performs {multi-objective alignment}
by training the LLM with our $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{A}$ction-$\textbf{H}$ead
$\textbf{DPO}$ (MAH-DPO) and a vectorized reward where the dimensions of the
vector correspond to the various objectives instead of a single scalar; and
(iii) demonstrates how such a system provides fine-grained inference-time user
control. Experiments across math reasoning, value alignment, and multi-turn
dialogue show that our framework improves performance across multiple
objectives simultaneously, while minimizing cross-objective trade-offs and
enabling flexible inference time user control. The code can be found at

Motivation: 金融领域机器学习模型需要高质量数据，但现实数据在数量、质量和多样性方面有限，阻碍了交易和投资模型的性能提升。

Method: 开发Fiaingen时间序列数据生成技术，通过降维空间分析、下游机器学习任务测试和运行时性能评估来验证方法有效性。

Result: Fiaingen方法在三个评估标准上达到最先进性能，生成的合成数据更接近原始时间序列，生成时间仅需几秒，且基于合成数据训练的模型性能接近真实数据训练结果。

Conclusion: Fiaingen方法能有效缓解金融数据短缺问题，为机器学习模型提供高质量合成数据，具有可扩展性和实用性。

Abstract: Data is vital in enabling machine learning models to advance research and
practical applications in finance, where accurate and robust models are
essential for investment and trading decision-making. However, real-world data
is limited despite its quantity, quality, and variety. The data shortage of
various financial assets directly hinders the performance of machine learning
models designed to trade and invest in these assets. Generative methods can
mitigate this shortage. In this paper, we introduce a set of novel techniques
for time series data generation (we name them Fiaingen) and assess their
performance across three criteria: (a) overlap of real-world and synthetic data
on a reduced dimensionality space, (b) performance on downstream machine
learning tasks, and (c) runtime performance. Our experiments demonstrate that
the methods achieve state-of-the-art performance across the three criteria
listed above. Synthetic data generated with Fiaingen methods more closely
mirrors the original time series data while keeping data generation time close
to seconds - ensuring the scalability of the proposed approach. Furthermore,
models trained on it achieve performance close to those trained with real-world
data.

Method: 使用广义权重归一化结合黎曼优化方法来解决过参数化矩阵感知问题。

Result: WN方法实现了线性收敛，迭代和样本复杂度随着过参数化程度的增加而多项式改善。

Conclusion: 这是首个刻画WN如何利用过参数化实现矩阵感知问题更快收敛的工作，证明了WN在理论上的优势。

Abstract: While normalization techniques are widely used in deep learning, their
theoretical understanding remains relatively limited. In this work, we
establish the benefits of (generalized) weight normalization (WN) applied to
the overparameterized matrix sensing problem. We prove that WN with Riemannian
optimization achieves linear convergence, yielding an exponential speedup over
standard methods that do not use WN. Our analysis further demonstrates that
both iteration and sample complexity improve polynomially as the level of
overparameterization increases. To the best of our knowledge, this work
provides the first characterization of how WN leverages overparameterization
for faster convergence in matrix sensing.

Motivation: 现有示例搜索方法仅优化预测准确性，忽视了模型校准这一影响可信度和安全部署的关键因素。

Method: 将示例选择建模为多目标优化问题，使用样本高效的组合贝叶斯优化算法(COM-BOM)寻找准确性和校准误差之间的帕累托前沿。

Result: 在多个MMLU-Pro基准任务上，COM-BOM在联合优化两个目标方面优于或匹配基线方法，且所需LLM API调用次数最少。

Conclusion: COM-BOM能够有效平衡准确性和校准，为可信的上下文学习提供了更好的示例选择方法。

Abstract: Selecting an optimal set of exemplars is critical for good performance of
in-context learning. However, prior exemplar search methods narrowly optimize
for predictive accuracy, critically neglecting model calibration--a key
determinant of trustworthiness and safe deployment. In this paper, we formulate
exemplar selection as a multi-objective optimization problem, explicitly
targeting both the maximization of predictive accuracy and the minimization of
expected calibration error. We solve this problem with a sample-efficient
Combinatorial Bayesian Optimization algorithm (COM-BOM) to find the Pareto
front that optimally trades off the two objectives of accuracy and calibration.
We evaluate COM-BOM on multiple tasks from unsaturated MMLU-Pro benchmark and
find that COM-BOM beats or matches the baselines at jointly optimizing the two
objectives, while requiring a minimal number of LLM API calls.

Motivation: 开源社区在工具-智能体系统开发中面临高质量训练数据匮乏的问题，现有数据集在多样性、真实性和复杂性方面存在局限，特别是多工具和多轮交互场景。

Method: 使用5个不同模型生成多样化工具使用查询，经过质量过滤后，用3个教师模型和2个智能体框架生成轨迹，并通过规则和模型验证确保质量，还引入3种扩展机制增强多样性。

Conclusion: Toucan数据集为开源工具-智能体系统开发提供了高质量、多样化的训练数据，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are rapidly emerging as powerful systems
for automating tasks across domains. Yet progress in the open-source community
is constrained by the lack of high quality permissively licensed tool-agentic
training data. Existing datasets are often limited in diversity, realism, and
complexity, particularly regarding multi-tool and multi-turn interactions. To
address this gap, we introduce Toucan, the largest publicly available
tool-agentic dataset to date, containing 1.5 million trajectories synthesized
from nearly 500 real-world Model Context Protocols (MCPs). Unlike prior work,
Toucan leverages authentic MCP environments to generate diverse, realistic, and
challenging tasks with trajectories involving real tool execution. Our pipeline
first produces a broad spectrum of tool-use queries using five distinct models,
applies model-based quality filtering, and then generates agentic trajectories
with three teacher models using two agentic frameworks. Rigorous rule-based and
model-based validation ensures high-quality outputs. We also introduce three
extension mechanisms to further diversify tasks and simulate multi-turn
conversations. Models fine-tuned on Toucan outperform larger closed-source
counterparts on the BFCL V3 benchmark and push the Pareto frontier forward on
MCP-Universe Bench.

Motivation: 现有ProRL方法通过增加训练步数来扩展强化学习，但在数千步后性能达到平台期，计算资源分配出现收益递减。本文探索通过增加每个样本的rollout数量来扩展RL的互补范式。

Method: 提出BroRL方法，将每个样本的rollout数量增加到数百个，进行充分探索。基于质量平衡方程分析，证明在足够大的rollout规模下，所有正确token的概率质量都会增加。

Result: BroRL方法能够复活在3K步ProRL训练后饱和的模型，并展现出稳健的持续改进，在1.5B模型上实现了跨多个基准测试的最先进结果。

Conclusion: 增加rollout数量是扩展强化学习的有效补充策略，能够突破训练步数扩展的性能瓶颈，为复杂推理能力的解锁提供了新途径。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key
ingredient for unlocking complex reasoning capabilities in large language
models. Recent work ProRL has shown promise in scaling RL by increasing the
number of training steps. However, performance plateaus after thousands of
steps, with clear diminishing returns from allocating more computation to
additional training. In this work, we investigate a complementary paradigm for
scaling RL, BroR-Lincreasing the number of rollouts per example to hundreds to
exhaustively Broaden exploration, which yields continuous performance gains
beyond the saturation point observed in ProRL when scaling the number of
training steps. Our approach is motivated by a mass balance equation analysis
allowing us to characterize the rate of change in probability mass for correct
and incorrect tokens during the reinforcement process. We show that under a
one-step RL assumption, sampled rollout tokens always contribute to
correct-mass expansion, while unsampled tokens outside rollouts may lead to
gains or losses depending on their distribution and the net reward balance.
Importantly, as the number of rollouts per example N increases, the effect of
unsampled terms diminishes, ensuring overall correct-mass expansion. To
validate our theoretical analysis, we conduct simulations under more relaxed
conditions and find that a sufficiently large rollout size N-corresponding to
ample exploration-guarantees an increase in the probability mass of all correct
tokens. Empirically, BroRL revives models saturated after 3K ProRL training
steps and demonstrates robust, continuous improvement, achieving
state-of-the-art results for the 1.5B model across diverse benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型缺乏对采样多样性的直接控制能力，用户无法灵活调整生成样本的多样性程度，限制了模型在不同任务中的适应性。

Method: 通过重新缩放噪声数据分布的（学习到的）得分函数来控制局部采样温度，该方法兼容确定性和随机性采样器，无需改变训练策略。

Result: 在2D玩具数据和五个不同任务（图像生成、姿态估计、深度预测、机器人操作、蛋白质设计）上验证有效，能够从更尖锐或更平坦的分布中采样，提升任务性能。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种简单有效的机制来控制扩散模型的采样多样性，适用于多种任务，且无需额外训练或修改模型架构。

Abstract: We present a mechanism to steer the sampling diversity of denoising diffusion
and flow matching models, allowing users to sample from a sharper or broader
distribution than the training distribution. We build on the observation that
these models leverage (learned) score functions of noisy data distributions for
sampling and show that rescaling these allows one to effectively control a
`local' sampling temperature. Notably, this approach does not require any
finetuning or alterations to training strategy, and can be applied to any
off-the-shelf model and is compatible with both deterministic and stochastic
samplers. We first validate our framework on toy 2D data, and then demonstrate
its application for diffusion models trained across five disparate tasks --
image generation, pose estimation, depth prediction, robot manipulation, and
protein design. We find that across these tasks, our approach allows sampling
from sharper (or flatter) distributions, yielding performance gains e.g., depth
prediction models benefit from sampling more likely depth estimates, whereas
image generation models perform better when sampling a slightly flatter
distribution. Project page: https://temporalscorerescaling.github.io

TL;DR: 提出Dirichlet-Prior Shaping Loss (DPSL)方法，通过将专家分配匹配到目标Dirichlet先验来直接塑造路由概率分布，解决了预训练密集模型上采样为稀疏MoE时专家专业化不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的将预训练密集模型上采样为稀疏MoE的方法虽然能有效增加模型容量，但由于简单的权重复制导致专家专业化不足，表现为低置信度、弱差异化的路由，从而影响性能。

Method: 引入DPSL路由器正则化技术，通过匹配专家分配到目标Dirichlet先验来直接塑造路由概率分布，提供对专家平衡和专业化的细粒度控制，并能编码归纳偏置。

Result: 在基于Qwen2、Phi3、Llama3.2 LLM骨干的上采样MoE视觉语言模型上的实验表明，DPSL在标准视觉语言基准上一致优于上采样策略和正则化技术。

Conclusion: DPSL解决了专家专业化不足的关键问题，促进了更具适应性、性能更高的模型，并且是一个适用于任何输出分类概率分布模块的通用工具。

Abstract: Upcycling pre-trained dense models into sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs)
efficiently increases model capacity but often suffers from poor expert
specialization due to naive weight replication. Our analysis reveals that
upcycled MoEs, even with conventional regularization, exhibit low-confidence,
weakly differentiated routing, hindering performance. We introduce
Dirichlet-Prior Shaping Loss (DPSL), a novel router regularization technique
that directly shapes routing probability distributions by matching expert
assignments to a target Dirichlet prior. DPSL offers fine-grained control over
expert balance and specialization, and enables encoding of inductive biases
such as encouraging experts to focus on specific modalities or tasks, without
requiring manual intervention; notably, DPSL is a general tool applicable to
any module that outputs categorical probability distributions, extending its
utility beyond MoE training. Experiments on upcycled MoE vision-language models
(with Qwen2, Phi3, Llama3.2 LLM backbones) show DPSL consistently outperforms
upcycling strategies and regularization techniques across standard
vision-language benchmarks, addressing the critical issue of poor
specialization and fostering more adaptive, higher-performing models.

spatial-temporal correspondence between the characters to maintain the
interaction, while creating natural transitions towards predefined keyposes. In
this research, we present a method for long-horizon interaction in-betweening
that enables two characters to engage and respond to one another naturally. To
effectively represent and synthesize interactions, we propose a novel solution
called Cross-Space In-Betweening, which models the interactions of each
character across different conditioning representation spaces. We further
observe that the significantly increased constraints in interacting characters
heavily limit the solution space, leading to degraded motion quality and
diminished interaction over time. To enable long-horizon synthesis, we present
two solutions to maintain long-term interaction and motion quality, thereby
keeping synthesis in the stable region of the solution space.We first sustain
interaction quality by identifying periodic interaction patterns through
adversarial learning. We further maintain the motion quality by learning to
refine the drifted latent space and prevent pose error accumulation. We
demonstrate that our approach produces realistic, controllable, and
long-horizon in-between motions of two characters with dynamic boxing and
dancing actions across multiple keyposes, supported by extensive quantitative
evaluations and user studies.

*Mark Boss,Andreas Engelhardt,Simon Donné,Varun Jampani*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了Reservoir SWD(ReSWD)，通过加权储层采样在优化过程中自适应保留信息丰富的投影方向，在保持无偏的同时实现稳定梯度，在合成基准和实际任务中优于标准SWD和其他方差减少基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布匹配是许多视觉和图形任务的核心，但高维分布下广泛使用的Wasserstein距离计算成本过高。切片Wasserstein距离(SWD)提供了可扩展的替代方案，但其蒙特卡洛估计器方差高，导致梯度噪声大且收敛缓慢。

Method: 将加权储层采样集成到SWD中，在优化步骤中自适应保留信息丰富的投影方向，实现稳定梯度同时保持无偏性。

Result: 在合成基准和实际任务(如颜色校正和扩散引导)上的实验表明，ReSWD始终优于标准SWD和其他方差减少基线。

Conclusion: ReSWD通过自适应保留信息投影方向，有效解决了SWD的高方差问题，在保持无偏性的同时实现了更稳定的优化性能。

Abstract: Distribution matching is central to many vision and graphics tasks, where the
widely used Wasserstein distance is too costly to compute for high dimensional
distributions. The Sliced Wasserstein Distance (SWD) offers a scalable
alternative, yet its Monte Carlo estimator suffers from high variance,
resulting in noisy gradients and slow convergence. We introduce Reservoir SWD
(ReSWD), which integrates Weighted Reservoir Sampling into SWD to adaptively
retain informative projection directions in optimization steps, resulting in
stable gradients while remaining unbiased. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks
and real-world tasks such as color correction and diffusion guidance show that
ReSWD consistently outperforms standard SWD and other variance reduction
baselines. Project page: https://reservoirswd.github.io/

Motivation: 为虚拟现实中的社交互动开发实时、低延迟的面部动画系统，使任何人都能进行自然的面部表情交流

Method: 使用编码器将音频转换为潜在面部表情序列，通过扩散模型解码为3D面部头像；采用在线transformer消除未来输入依赖，蒸馏管道将迭代去噪加速为单步

Conclusion: 该系统成功实现了实时、逼真的3D面部动画，为VR社交互动提供了有效的解决方案，并支持多模态应用扩展

Abstract: We present an audio-driven real-time system for animating photorealistic 3D
facial avatars with minimal latency, designed for social interactions in
virtual reality for anyone. Central to our approach is an encoder model that
transforms audio signals into latent facial expression sequences in real time,
which are then decoded as photorealistic 3D facial avatars. Leveraging the
generative capabilities of diffusion models, we capture the rich spectrum of
facial expressions necessary for natural communication while achieving
real-time performance (<15ms GPU time). Our novel architecture minimizes
latency through two key innovations: an online transformer that eliminates
dependency on future inputs and a distillation pipeline that accelerates
iterative denoising into a single step. We further address critical design
challenges in live scenarios for processing continuous audio signals
frame-by-frame while maintaining consistent animation quality. The versatility
of our framework extends to multimodal applications, including semantic
modalities such as emotion conditions and multimodal sensors with head-mounted
eye cameras on VR headsets. Experimental results demonstrate significant
improvements in facial animation accuracy over existing offline
state-of-the-art baselines, achieving 100 to 1000 times faster inference speed.
We validate our approach through live VR demonstrations and across various
scenarios such as multilingual speeches.

Abstract: Attitude stabilization of unmanned aerial vehicles in uncertain environments
presents significant challenges due to nonlinear dynamics, parameter
variations, and sensor limitations. This paper presents a comparative study of
$\mathcal{H}_\infty$ and classical PID controllers for multi-rotor attitude
regulation in the presence of wind disturbances and gyroscope noise. The flight
dynamics are modeled using a linear parameter-varying (LPV) framework, where
nonlinearities and parameter variations are systematically represented as
structured uncertainties within a linear fractional transformation formulation.
A robust controller based on $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ formulation is designed using
only gyroscope measurements to ensure guaranteed performance bounds. Nonlinear
simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the robust controllers
compared to classical PID control, showing significant improvement in attitude
regulation under severe wind disturbances.

Motivation: 解决未知动态系统的最优控制问题，统一基于模型的控制与数据驱动的学习方法，构建理论与实践之间的桥梁。

Conclusion: CLC作为经典最优控制与现代学习方法的实用且理论基础的桥梁，在保持模型设计优势的同时实现数据驱动的权重调整。

Abstract: In this paper, we present the combined learning-and-control (CLC) approach,
which is a new way to solve optimal control problems with unknown dynamics by
unifying model-based control and data-driven learning. The key idea is simple:
we design a controller to be optimal for a proxy objective built on an
available model while penalizing mismatches with the real system, so that the
resulting controller is also optimal for the actual system. Building on the
original CLC formulation, we demonstrate the framework to the linear quadratic
regulator problem and make three advances: (i) we show that the CLC penalty is
a sequence of stage-specific weights rather than a single constant; (ii) we
identify when these weights can be set in advance and when they must depend on
the (unknown) dynamics; and (iii) we develop a lightweight learning loop that
tunes the weights directly from data without abandoning the benefits of a
model-based design. We provide a complete algorithm and an empirical study
against common baseline methods. The results clarify where prior knowledge
suffices and where learning is essential, and they position CLC as a practical,
theoretically grounded bridge between classical optimal control and modern
learning methods.

TL;DR: 提出了多模态LMPC方法，通过聚类历史轨迹并维护模态特定的终端集和价值函数，结合基于多臂老虎机的元控制器来平衡探索和利用，克服传统LMPC容易陷入局部最优的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LMPC方法过度依赖初始轨迹，容易陷入局部最优解，无法探索状态空间中可能存在的更优路径。例如在避障任务中，可能只优化初始选择的路径而忽略其他可能更优的路径。

Method: 将历史轨迹聚类为不同模态，维护模态特定的终端集和价值函数。使用基于置信下界策略的多臂老虎机元控制器来平衡不同模态的探索和利用。

Result: 理论证明了递归可行性、闭环稳定性、渐进收敛到最优模态以及对数遗憾界。避障任务仿真验证了性能提升。

Conclusion: MM-LMPC能够有效逃离高成本局部最优解，发现全局更优解，在保持LMPC优点的同时解决了其探索不足的问题。

Abstract: Learning Model Predictive Control (LMPC) improves performance on iterative
tasks by leveraging data from previous executions. At each iteration, LMPC
constructs a sampled safe set from past trajectories and uses it as a terminal
constraint, with a terminal cost given by the corresponding cost-to-go. While
effective, LMPC heavily depends on the initial trajectories: states with high
cost-to-go are rarely selected as terminal candidates in later iterations,
leaving parts of the state space unexplored and potentially missing better
solutions. For example, in a reach-avoid task with two possible routes, LMPC
may keep refining the initially shorter path while neglecting the alternative
path that could lead to a globally better solution. To overcome this
limitation, we propose Multi-Modal LMPC (MM-LMPC), which clusters past
trajectories into modes and maintains mode-specific terminal sets and value
functions. A bandit-based meta-controller with a Lower Confidence Bound (LCB)
policy balances exploration and exploitation across modes, enabling systematic
refinement of all modes. This allows MM-LMPC to escape high-cost local optima
and discover globally superior solutions. We establish recursive feasibility,
closed-loop stability, asymptotic convergence to the best mode, and a
logarithmic regret bound. Simulations on obstacle-avoidance tasks validate the
performance improvements of the proposed method.

Conclusion: 该模型控制框架能够有效处理软体机器人执行器正负压调节中的复杂动力学问题，实现精确的参考跟踪，同时满足输入约束并优化能耗和切换频率。

Abstract: Positive-negative pressure regulation is critical to soft robotic actuators,
enabling large motion ranges and versatile actuation modes. However, it remains
challenging due to complex nonlinearities, oscillations, and
direction-dependent, piecewise dynamics introduced by affordable pneumatic
valves and the bidirectional architecture. We present a model-based control
framework that couples a physics-grounded switched nonlinear plant model
(inflation/deflation modes) with a mixed-integer nonlinear model predictive
controller (MI-NMPC). The controller co-optimizes mode scheduling and PWM
inputs to realize accurate reference tracking while enforcing input constraints
and penalizing energy consumption and excessive switching. To make discrete
mode decisions tractable, we employ a Combinatorial Integral Approximation that
relaxes binary mode variables to continuous surrogates within the
valve-scheduling layer. With parameters identified from the physical system,
simulations with step and sinusoidal references validate the proposed MI-NMPC,
showing a consistently favorable trade-off among accuracy, control effort, and
switching, and outperforming conventional PID and NMPC with heuristic mode
selection.

Conclusion: 该频域系统辨识方案能有效减少正弦响应运行次数，同时保证辨识精度和系统稳定性，特别适用于响应运行成本高的系统。

Abstract: We present a frequency-domain system identification scheme based on
barycentric interpolation and weight optimization. The scheme is related to the
Adaptive Antoulas-Anderson (AAA) algorithm for model reduction, but uses an
adaptive algorithm for selection of frequency points for interrogating the
system response, as would be required in identification versus model reduction.
The scheme is particularly suited for systems in which any one sinusoidal
response run is long or expensive, and thus there is an incentive to reduce the
total number of such runs. Two key features of our algorithm are the use of
transient data in sinusoidal runs to both optimize the barycentric weights, and
automated next-frequency selection on an adaptive grid. Both are done with
error criteria that are proxies for a system's $H^2$ and $H^\infty$ norms
respectively. Furthermore, the optimization problem we formulate is convex, and
can optionally guarantee stability of the identified system. Computational
results on a high-order, lightly damped structural system highlights the
efficacy of this scheme.

Abstract: Ensuring the structural integrity of bridges is essential for maintaining
infrastructure safety and promoting long-term sustainability. In this context,
Indirect Structural Health Monitoring (ISHM) through drive-by bridge inspection
emerges as a promising alternative to traditional inspection methods, offering
a cost-effective and scalable solution by using vehicle-mounted sensors to
assess the condition of bridges without requiring direct instrumentation. This
study introduces the first purpose-built electric inspection vehicle
specifically designed for drive-by bridge inspection. The autonomous platform
is capable of maintaining a constant low speed and offers customisable
operational parameters to maximise the accuracy and repeatability of indirect
sensing, capabilities not achieved in previous studies. The vehicle is deployed
within an ISHM framework and tested on two full-scale bridges to evaluate its
effectiveness in capturing structural dynamic responses. Two unsupervised
frameworks are then employed to analyse the collected data to identify features
indicative of bridge properties and structural condition. The promising
findings from this study demonstrate the practical feasibility of the approach.
The study also shows the potential of ISHM as a viable tool for efficient
bridge monitoring, contributing to the development of next-generation
structural health monitoring systems that can enhance safety, optimise
maintenance strategies, and support the longevity of critical infrastructure.

that enforces inter-agent \textbf{rotational} symmetries, with its gradient
defining the control law driving the agents toward a desired symmetric and
planar configuration. We show that only $(n-1)$ edges, the minimal connectivity
requirement, are sufficient to implement the control strategy, where $n$ is the
number of agents. We further augment the design to address the
\textbf{maneuvering problem}, enabling the formation to undergo coordinated
translations, rotations, and scalings along a predefined virtual trajectory.
Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the
proposed method.

Abstract: Buildings represent a promising flexibility source to support the integration
of renewable energy sources, as they may shift their heating energy consumption
over time without impacting users' comfort. However, a building's predicted
flexibility potential is based on uncertain ambient weather forecasts and a
typically inaccurate building thermal model. Hence, this paper presents an
uncertainty-aware flexibility quantifier using a chance-constrained
formulation. Because such a quantifier may be conservative, we additionally
model real-time feedback in the quantification, in the form of affine feedback
policies. Such adaptation can take the form of intra-day trades or rebound
around the flexibility provision period. To assess the flexibility
quantification formulations, we further assume that flexible buildings
participate in secondary frequency control markets. The results show some
increase in flexibility and revenues when introducing affine feedback policies.
Additionally, it is demonstrated that accounting for uncertainties in the
flexibility quantification is necessary, especially when intra-day trades are
not available. Even though an uncertainty-ignorant potential may seem
financially profitable in secondary frequency control markets, it comes at the
cost of significant thermal discomfort for inhabitants. Hence, we suggest a
comfort-preserving approach, aiming to truly reflect thermal discomfort on the
economic flexibility revenue, to obtain a fairer comparison.

Abstract: Interactive Imitation Learning deals with training a novice policy from
expert demonstrations in an online fashion. The established DAgger algorithm
trains a robust novice policy by alternating between interacting with the
environment and retraining of the network. Many variants thereof exist, that
differ in the method of discerning whether to allow the novice to act or return
control to the expert. We propose the use of stochastic reachtubes - common in
verification of dynamical systems - as a novel method for estimating the
necessity of expert intervention. Our approach does not require fine-tuning of
decision thresholds per environment and effectively reduces the number of
expert interventions, especially when compared with related approaches that
make use of a doubt classification model.

Abstract: Digital control has become increasingly widespread in modern power electronic
converters. When acquiring feedback signals such as the inductor current,
synchronizing the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with the digital
pulse-width modulator (DPWM) is commonly employed to accurately track their
steady-state average. However, the small-signal implications of such
synchronization have not been investigated. This paper presents an exact
small-signal model for digitally controlled buck converters operating in forced
continuous-conduction mode (FCCM) under constant-frequency current-mode
control, explicitly accounting for DPWM-ADC synchronization. Using a
sampled-data framework, the proposed model captures all sideband effects
introduced by the sampling process, yielding precise predictions of both analog
and digital loop gains, even at frequencies beyond the switching and sampling
frequencies. Both asymmetrical and symmetrical carrier modulations are
considered. Furthermore, the digital loop gain is derived in closed form using
the modified z-transform, enabling low-complexity compensator design and
stability assessment. Within this framework, the analog loop gain can be
directly obtained from the digital loop gain, thereby eliminating the need for
computationally intensive infinite series evaluations. The validity of the
proposed model is confirmed through both simulation and experimental results.

Abstract: Vehicle data is essential for advancing data-driven development throughout
the automotive lifecycle, including requirements engineering, design,
verification, and validation, and post-deployment optimization. Developers
currently collect data in a decentralized and fragmented manner across
simulations, test benches, and real-world driving, resulting in data silos,
inconsistent formats, and limited interoperability. This leads to redundant
efforts, inefficient integration, and suboptimal use of data. This
fragmentation results in data silos, inconsistent storage structures, and
limited interoperability, leading to redundant data collection, inefficient
integration, and suboptimal application. To address these challenges, this
article presents a structured literature review and develops an inductive
taxonomy for automotive data. This taxonomy categorizes data according to its
sources and applications, improving data accessibility and utilization. The
analysis reveals a growing emphasis on real-world driving and machine learning
applications while highlighting a critical gap in data availability for
requirements engineering. By providing a systematic framework for structuring
automotive data, this research contributes to more efficient data management
and improved decision-making in the automotive industry.

Abstract: Electric autonomous mobility-on-demand (EAMoD) systems are emerging all over
the world. However, their potential swarm charging in depots may deteriorate
operation of the power system, further in turn affecting EAMoD system's optimal
operation. To prevent this latent risk, we develop a real-time coordination
framework for the EAMoD system and the power system. First, the
temporal-spatial characteristics of EAMoD fleets are fully described based on a
Markov decision process model, including serving trips, repositioning, and
charging. Second, charger accessibility of EAMoD depot charging is well modeled
as real-world configuration, wherein fast and slow charge piles are both
included. Third, the power system regulation model provides real-time charging
regulation constraints for EAMoD systems to prevent potential overload and
undervoltage. To address the poor solution quality attributed to the complex
decision space of the EAMoD system, this paper proposes a piecewise
linear-based approximate dynamic programming algorithm combined with model
predictive control. Numerical experiments in the Manhattan and a 14-node power
distribution network validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and
underscore the necessity of system coordination.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效评估最优定价对大规模耦合电力-交通网络运行性能的影响，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In the last decade, charging service providers are emerging along with the
prevalence of electric vehicles. These providers need to strategically optimize
their charging prices to improve the profits considering operation conditions
of the coupled power-transportation network. However, the optimal pricing
problem generally involves the user equilibrium model, which leads to a
mathematical program with equilibrium constraints. As a result, the pricing
problem is non-convex and computationally intractable especially for
large-scale network. To address this challenge, we propose a generalized
sensitivity analysis approach for optimal pricing of electric vehicle charging
on coupled power-transportation network. Specifically, we adopt a sensitivity
analysis to capture the best response of charging demand to charging price in
the gradient form. Consequently, charging service providers can make pricing
decisions based on the gradient information instead of the conventional KKT
conditions of the user equilibrium model. We then propose a tailored gradient
descent algorithm to solve the whole pricing problem. The mathematical proof of
validity is given and the time complexity of the proposed algorithm is
theoretically polynomial. Numerical experiments on different scales of networks
verify the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm, indicating its
potential in evaluating the impact of the optimal pricing on the operational
performance of large-scale coupled power-transportation network.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对离散时间线性多变量系统，需要处理多个扰动并建立扩展状态观测器的存在条件，特别是当扰动增益矩阵非对角时的情况。

Method: 提出MB-ESO及其变体，将多个扰动定义为扩展状态向量，利用与未知输入观测器(UIO)的联系建立存在条件，分析误差特性并推导扰动估计误差的传递函数。

Result: 建立了MB-ESO在多变量系统中存在的必要条件(无不变零点)，证明变体MB-ESO与UIO产生相同的扰动估计，MB-ESO的扰动估计误差随观测器特征值和时间单调减小。

Conclusion: MB-ESO及其变体为多变量系统提供有效的扰动估计方法，建立了明确的存在条件，并证明了其误差收敛特性。

Abstract: A model-based extended state observer (MB-ESO) and its variant are proposed
for discrete-time linear multivariable systems, where multiple disturbances are
defined as an extended state vector in the same manner as in the original
formulation of ESO. The variant MB-ESO extends the MB-ESO to address cases
where the disturbance gain matrix is non-diagonal. Leveraging the connection
between the variant MB-ESO and the well-known unknown input observer (UIO), the
condition for the existence of a MB-ESO and its variant in multivariable
systems is established, for the first time, i.e., no invariant zeros exist
between the disturbances and the plant outputs. It is shown that, with the
observer eigenvalues all placed at the origin and the subsystems decoupled, the
variant MB-ESO produces the identical disturbance estimation as that of UIO.
Moreover, the error characteristics of MB-ESO and its variant are analyzed and
the transfer functions associated with the disturbance estimation errors are
derived. It is demonstrated both mathematically and in simulations that the
disturbance estimation error of MB-ESO decreases monotonically with respect to
both the observer eigenvalues and time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双系统无人机作为安全关键系统，需要在发生故障时保持安全飞行。现有容错控制方法设计复杂，需要减少设计点数量并简化控制综合过程。

Method: 将执行器故障引起的控制效能损失建模为模型输入不确定性，使用乘性不确定性描述，开发增益调度结构化H无穷被动容错控制系统。

Result: 在非线性六自由度仿真器上验证，相比LQR和结构化H无穷控制系统，提出的方法具有更优越的容错性能。

Abstract: Dual-system UAVs with vertical take-off and landing capabilities have become
increasingly popular in recent years. As a safety-critical system, it is
important that a dual-system UAV can maintain safe flight after faults/failures
occur. This paper proposes a gain-scheduled passive fault-tolerant control
(PFTC) method for the transition flight of dual-system UAVs. In this novel FTC
design method, the model uncertainties arising from the loss of control
effectiveness caused by actuator faults/failures, for the first time, are
treated as model input uncertainty, allowing us to use multiplicative
uncertainty descriptions to represent it. The advantages of the proposed method
consist in significantly reducing the number of design points, thereby
simplifying the control synthesis process and improving the efficiency of
designing the FTC system for dual-system UAV transition flight compared with
the existing FTC design methods. As a general method, it can be applied to the
design of FTC systems with multiple uncertain parameters and multiple channels.
The developed passive FTC system is validated on a nonlinear
six-degree-of-freedom simulator. The simulation results demonstrate that the
gain-scheduled structured H infinity (GS SHIF) PFTC system provides superior
fault tolerance performance compared with the LQR and structured H infinity
control systems, thereby showcasing the effectiveness and the advantages of the
proposed GS SHIF PFTC approach.

TL;DR: 提出基于决策树约束学习的数据驱动线性化框架，将非线性最低频率约束嵌入混合整数线性规划，优化数据中心参与频率响应的发电调度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据中心基础设施快速扩张显著增加电力需求，同时提供快速可控灵活性潜力。为确保可靠运行，需在频率安全机组组合问题中增强需求侧频率响应建模。

Method: 基于决策树约束学习的数据驱动线性化框架，将非线性最低频率约束转化为混合整数线性规划问题。

Result: 增加灵活数据中心负载比例持续改善系统成本效益并支持可再生能源并网，但存在边际效益递减现象。提出边际灵活性价值指标量化额外灵活性的经济价值。

Conclusion: 随着数据中心在系统负载中占比增大，其积极参与频率响应对维持经济安全的系统运行将日益不可或缺。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of data center infrastructure is reshaping power system
dynamics by significantly increasing electricity demand while also offering
potential for fast and controllable flexibility. To ensure reliable operation
under such conditions, the frequency secured unit commitment problem must be
solved with enhanced modeling of demand side frequency response. In this work,
we propose a data-driven linearization framework based on decision tree based
constraint learning to embed nonlinear nadir frequency constraints into
mixed-integer linear programming. This approach enables tractable optimization
of generation schedules and fast frequency response from data centers. Through
case studies on both a benchmark system and a 2030 future scenario with higher
DC penetration, we demonstrate that increasing the proportion of flexible DC
load consistently improves system cost efficiency and supports renewable
integration. However, this benefit exhibits diminishing marginal returns,
motivating the introduction of the Marginal Flexibility Value metric to
quantify the economic value of additional flexibility. The results highlight
that as DCs become a larger share of system load, their active participation in
frequency response will be increasingly indispensable for maintaining both
economic and secure system operations.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出预测控制屏障函数(PCBF)框架，用于在具有未知相对度的离散时间系统中强制执行状态约束，解决了输入延迟或未建模输入动力学导致的相对度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有离散时间CBF方法在相对度大于1时需要构造辅助屏障函数，这使实现复杂化并可能导致保守的安全集。PCBF框架旨在通过扩展预测范围来克服这一挑战。

Method: 通过扩展预测范围构造相对度为1的关联系统的CBF，使PCBF的超水平集与安全集重合，无需辅助函数。

Result: 在具有输入延迟的离散时间双积分器和具有位置约束的双旋翼系统上验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: PCBF框架简化了约束执行，消除了对辅助函数的需求，为具有未知相对度的系统提供了有效的安全约束执行方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces a predictive control barrier function (PCBF) framework
for enforcing state constraints in discrete-time systems with unknown relative
degree, which can be caused by input delays or unmodeled input dynamics.
Existing discrete-time CBF formulations typically require the construction of
auxiliary barrier functions when the relative degree is greater than one, which
complicates implementation and may yield conservative safe sets. The proposed
PCBF framework addresses this challenge by extending the prediction horizon to
construct a CBF for an associated system with relative degree one. As a result,
the superlevel set of the PCBF coincides with the safe set, simplifying
constraint enforcement and eliminating the need for auxiliary functions. The
effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on a discrete-time double
integrator with input delay and a bicopter system with position constraints.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出了递归跟踪函数(RTFs)来替代传统Lyapunov跟踪函数，结合控制屏障函数(CBFs)构建递归CBFs(RCBFs)，解决高阶非线性系统安全控制器合成的计算难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对高阶非线性系统，构建有效的控制屏障函数(CBFs)在计算上不可行，且传统Lyapunov跟踪函数需要单调递减，但系统化合成方法仅适用于全驱动系统。

Method: 利用分层控制，在降阶模型中设计CBFs，同时调节全阶模型动力学。引入RTFs替代单调衰减要求，采用有限时间递归条件，允许跟踪误差的瞬态偏差。通过将降阶模型的CBFs与RTFs结合构建RCBFs。

Result: 建立了理论安全保证，并通过数值实验验证了RTFs的有效性和全阶模型的安全性。

Conclusion: 所提出的递归CBFs方法能够保证安全，同时允许跟踪误差的瞬态偏差，为高阶非线性系统的安全控制器合成提供了可行方案。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of synthesizing safety-critical
controllers for high-order nonlinear systems, where constructing valid Control
Barrier Functions (CBFs) remains computationally intractable. Leveraging
layered control, we design CBFs in reduced-order models (RoMs) while regulating
full-order models' (FoMs) dynamics at the same time. Traditional Lyapunov
tracking functions are required to decrease monotonically, but systematic
synthesis methods for such functions exist only for fully-actuated systems. To
overcome this limitation, we introduce Recurrent Tracking Functions (RTFs),
which replace the monotonic decay requirement with a weaker finite-time
recurrence condition. This relaxation permits transient deviations of tracking
errors while ensuring safety. By augmenting CBFs for RoMs with RTFs, we
construct recurrent CBFs (RCBFs) whose zero-superlevel set is control
$\tau$-recurrent, and guarantee safety for all initial states in such a set
when RTFs are satisfied. We establish theoretical safety guarantees and
validate the approach through numerical experiments, demonstrating RTFs'
effectiveness and the safety of FoMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自主机器人系统在执行复杂或长时程任务时存在开放循环范式的问题，缺乏推理和反馈机制，导致对环境变化的鲁棒性差和错误累积严重。

Method: 采用双思维闭环框架，结合原始动作进行结构化任务规划和灵活动作生成，引入反馈机制实现动态变化和错误的重规划，利用思维链推理增强高层任务规划并指导底层动作生成。

Conclusion: RoboPilot框架通过闭环反馈和双思维机制，显著提升了机器人操作系统的鲁棒性和适应性，能够有效应对复杂任务和动态环境。

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in autonomous robotics, executing complex or
long-horizon tasks remains a fundamental challenge. Most current approaches
follow an open-loop paradigm with limited reasoning and no feedback, resulting
in poor robustness to environmental changes and severe error accumulation. We
present RoboPilot, a dual-thinking closed-loop framework for robotic
manipulation that supports adaptive reasoning for complex tasks in real-world
dynamic environments. RoboPilot leverages primitive actions for structured task
planning and flexible action generation, while introducing feedback to enable
replanning from dynamic changes and execution errors. Chain-of-Thought
reasoning further enhances high-level task planning and guides low-level action
generation. The system dynamically switches between fast and slow thinking to
balance efficiency and accuracy. To systematically evaluate the robustness of
RoboPilot in diverse robot manipulation scenarios, we introduce
RoboPilot-Bench, a benchmark spanning 21 tasks across 10 categories, including
infeasible-task recognition and failure recovery. Experiments show that
RoboPilot outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 25.9\% in task success
rate, and the real-world deployment on an industrial robot further demonstrates
its robustness in real-world settings.

Motivation: 探索LLM在机器人任务规划中的能力范围，研究如何将LLM的语义知识与TAMP的形式推理相结合。

Method: 开发16种使用Gemini 2.5 Flash替代TAMP关键组件的算法，在4,950个问题和三个领域进行零样本实验。

Result: Gemini规划器成功率较低、规划时间更长；提供几何细节会增加任务规划错误；非推理LLM变体在多数情况下优于推理变体。

Conclusion: LLM在TAMP系统中的集成需要谨慎设计，非推理LLM变体可能更有效，因为TAMP系统可以指导LLM纠正错误。

Abstract: Using large language models (LLMs) to solve complex robotics problems
requires understanding their planning capabilities. Yet while we know that LLMs
can plan on some problems, the extent to which these planning capabilities
cover the space of robotics tasks is unclear. One promising direction is to
integrate the semantic knowledge of LLMs with the formal reasoning of task and
motion planning (TAMP). However, the myriad of choices for how to integrate
LLMs within TAMP complicates the design of such systems. We develop 16
algorithms that use Gemini 2.5 Flash to substitute key TAMP components. Our
zero-shot experiments across 4,950 problems and three domains reveal that the
Gemini-based planners exhibit lower success rates and higher planning times
than their engineered counterparts. We show that providing geometric details
increases the number of task-planning errors compared to pure PDDL
descriptions, and that (faster) non-reasoning LLM variants outperform (slower)
reasoning variants in most cases, since the TAMP system can direct the LLM to
correct its mistakes.

Motivation: 传统NMPC计算负担重，而纯神经网络近似的NMPC在遇到训练数据未覆盖的扰动或工况时缺乏鲁棒性，导致跟踪误差大。

Method: 开发了具有三个主动关节（踝、膝、髋）的人机动力学模型，使用530多万个训练样本训练DNN，然后将NMPC-DNN输出与PI控制器结合形成混合控制器。

Result: 在DNN未见过的条件下，混合控制器的跟踪误差显著低于纯NMPC-DNN；使用外骨骼后人体关节扭矩大幅降低（踝关节30.9%、膝关节41.8%、髋关节29.7%）；计算成本比NMPC降低99.93%。

Conclusion: 混合NMPC-DNN-PI控制器在保持NMPC精度的同时，显著提高了鲁棒性并大幅降低了计算成本，为复杂动态系统的实时控制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) is a precise controller, but its
heavy computational load often prevents application in robotic systems. Some
studies have attempted to approximate NMPC using deep neural networks
(NMPC-DNN). However, in the presence of unexpected disturbances or when
operating conditions differ from training data, this approach lacks robustness,
leading to large tracking errors. To address this issue, for the first time,
the NMPC-DNN output is combined with a PI controller (Hybrid NMPC-DNN-PI). The
proposed controller is validated by applying it to an exoskeleton robot during
squat movement, which has a complex dynamic model and has received limited
attention regarding robust nonlinear control design. A human-robot dynamic
model with three active joints (ankle, knee, hip) is developed, and more than
5.3 million training samples are used to train the DNN. The results show that,
under unseen conditions for the DNN, the tracking error in Hybrid NMPC-DNN-PI
is significantly lower compared to NMPC-DNN. Moreover, human joint torques are
greatly reduced with the use of the exoskeleton, with RMS values for the
studied case reduced by 30.9%, 41.8%, and 29.7% at the ankle, knee, and hip,
respectively. In addition, the computational cost of Hybrid NMPC-DNN-PI is
99.93% lower than that of NMPC.

Conclusion: TGPO通过分层结构和密集的阶段奖励有效解决了通用STL任务的强化学习问题，在复杂任务中展现出显著优势。

Abstract: Learning control policies for complex, long-horizon tasks is a central
challenge in robotics and autonomous systems. Signal Temporal Logic (STL)
offers a powerful and expressive language for specifying such tasks, but its
non-Markovian nature and inherent sparse reward make it difficult to be solved
via standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. Prior RL approaches focus
only on limited STL fragments or use STL robustness scores as sparse terminal
rewards. In this paper, we propose TGPO, Temporal Grounded Policy Optimization,
to solve general STL tasks. TGPO decomposes STL into timed subgoals and
invariant constraints and provides a hierarchical framework to tackle the
problem. The high-level component of TGPO proposes concrete time allocations
for these subgoals, and the low-level time-conditioned policy learns to achieve
the sequenced subgoals using a dense, stage-wise reward signal. During
inference, we sample various time allocations and select the most promising
assignment for the policy network to rollout the solution trajectory. To foster
efficient policy learning for complex STL with multiple subgoals, we leverage
the learned critic to guide the high-level temporal search via
Metropolis-Hastings sampling, focusing exploration on temporally feasible
solutions. We conduct experiments on five environments, ranging from
low-dimensional navigation to manipulation, drone, and quadrupedal locomotion.
Under a wide range of STL tasks, TGPO significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines (especially for high-dimensional and long-horizon
cases), with an average of 31.6% improvement in task success rate compared to
the best baseline. The code will be available at

Conclusion: BC-MPPI提供了一种可验证的自主系统安全框架，概率代理作为独立组件便于版本控制和验证验证流程集成。

Abstract: Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control has recently emerged as a fast,
gradient-free alternative to model-predictive control in highly non-linear
robotic tasks, yet it offers no hard guarantees on constraint satisfaction. We
introduce Bayesian-Constraints MPPI (BC-MPPI), a lightweight safety layer that
attaches a probabilistic surrogate to every state and input constraint. At each
re-planning step the surrogate returns the probability that a candidate
trajectory is feasible; this joint probability scales the weight given to a
candidate, automatically down-weighting rollouts likely to collide or exceed
limits and pushing the sampling distribution toward the safe subset; no
hand-tuned penalty costs or explicit sample rejection required. We train the
surrogate from 1000 offline simulations and deploy the controller on a
quadrotor in MuJoCo with both static and moving obstacles. Across K in
[100,1500] rollouts BC-MPPI preserves safety margins while satisfying the
prescribed probability of violation. Because the surrogate is a stand-alone,
version-controlled artefact and the runtime safety score is a single scalar,
the approach integrates naturally with verification-and-validation pipelines
for certifiable autonomous systems.

Conclusion: MO-IRL能够有效揭示人类运动控制中动态的、被试独立的成本结构，学习到的权重在运动起始和终止阶段强调关节加速度最小化，符合生物运动的平滑性原则。

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Minimal Observation Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (MO-IRL) to model and predict human arm-reaching
movements with time-varying cost weights. Using a planar two-link biomechanical
model and high-resolution motion-capture data from subjects performing a
pointing task, we segment each trajectory into multiple phases and learn
phase-specific combinations of seven candidate cost functions. MO-IRL
iteratively refines cost weights by scaling observed and generated trajectories
in the maximum entropy IRL formulation, greatly reducing the number of required
demonstrations and convergence time compared to classical IRL approaches.
Training on ten trials per posture yields average joint-angle Root Mean Squared
Errors (RMSE) of 6.4 deg and 5.6 deg for six- and eight-segment weight
divisions, respectively, versus 10.4 deg using a single static weight.
Cross-validation on remaining trials and, for the first time, inter-subject
validation on an unseen subject's 20 trials, demonstrates comparable predictive
accuracy, around 8 deg RMSE, indicating robust generalization. Learned weights
emphasize joint acceleration minimization during movement onset and
termination, aligning with smoothness principles observed in biological motion.
These results suggest that MO-IRL can efficiently uncover dynamic,
subject-independent cost structures underlying human motor control, with
potential applications for humanoid robots.

Conclusion: DiSA-IQL有效解决了离线RL中的分布偏移问题，为软体机器人控制提供了更安全有效的解决方案

Abstract: Soft snake robots offer remarkable flexibility and adaptability in complex
environments, yet their control remains challenging due to highly nonlinear
dynamics. Existing model-based and bio-inspired controllers rely on simplified
assumptions that limit performance. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has
recently emerged as a promising alternative, but online training is often
impractical because of costly and potentially damaging real-world interactions.
Offline RL provides a safer option by leveraging pre-collected datasets, but it
suffers from distribution shift, which degrades generalization to unseen
scenarios. To overcome this challenge, we propose DiSA-IQL
(Distribution-Shift-Aware Implicit Q-Learning), an extension of IQL that
incorporates robustness modulation by penalizing unreliable state-action pairs
to mitigate distribution shift. We evaluate DiSA-IQL on goal-reaching tasks
across two settings: in-distribution and out-of-distribution evaluation.
Simulation results show that DiSA-IQL consistently outperforms baseline models,

Abstract: Long-horizon motion forecasting for multiple autonomous robots is challenging
due to non-linear agent interactions, compounding prediction errors, and
continuous-time evolution of dynamics. Learned dynamics of such a system can be
useful in various applications such as travel time prediction,
prediction-guided planning and generative simulation. In this work, we aim to
develop an efficient trajectory forecasting model conditioned on multi-agent
goals. Motivated by the recent success of physics-guided deep learning for
partially known dynamical systems, we develop a model based on neural
Controlled Differential Equations (CDEs) for long-horizon motion forecasting.
Unlike discrete-time methods such as RNNs and transformers, neural CDEs operate
in continuous time, allowing us to combine physics-informed constraints and
biases to jointly model multi-robot dynamics. Our approach, named PINCoDE
(Physics-Informed Neural Controlled Differential Equations), learns
differential equation parameters that can be used to predict the trajectories
of a multi-agent system starting from an initial condition. PINCoDE is
conditioned on future goals and enforces physics constraints for robot motion
over extended periods of time. We adopt a strategy that scales our model from
10 robots to 100 robots without the need for additional model parameters, while
producing predictions with an average ADE below 0.5 m for a 1-minute horizon.
Furthermore, progressive training with curriculum learning for our PINCoDE
model results in a 2.7X reduction of forecasted pose error over 4 minute
horizons compared to analytical models.

Motivation: 解决VLA模型依赖模仿学习导致的复合错误和分布偏移下的鲁棒性问题，同时避免强化学习对真实交互的高成本需求和模拟到现实的差距。

Conclusion: 基于世界模型的RFT是一个实用的后训练范式，能够有效增强VLA模型的泛化性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models enable embodied decision-making but rely
heavily on imitation learning, leading to compounding errors and poor
robustness under distribution shift. Reinforcement learning (RL) can mitigate
these issues yet typically demands costly real-world interactions or suffers
from sim-to-real gaps. We introduce VLA-RFT, a reinforcement fine-tuning
framework that leverages a data-driven world model as a controllable simulator.
Trained from real interaction data, the simulator predicts future visual
observations conditioned on actions, allowing policy rollouts with dense,
trajectory-level rewards derived from goal-achieving references. This design
delivers an efficient and action-aligned learning signal, drastically lowering
sample requirements. With fewer than 400 fine-tuning steps, VLA-RFT surpasses
strong supervised baselines and achieves greater efficiency than
simulator-based RL. Moreover, it exhibits strong robustness under perturbed
conditions, sustaining stable task execution. Our results establish
world-model-based RFT as a practical post-training paradigm to enhance the
generalization and robustness of VLA models. For more details, please refer to

TL;DR: NeuRO是一个集成学习优化框架，将感知网络与下游任务级鲁棒优化紧密结合，通过PICNN和保形校准将视觉预测转化为凸不确定性集合，解决数据稀缺下的视觉导航泛化问题。

Motivation: 视觉导航是具身AI的基础问题，但实际部署需要长时程规划能力。现有神经网络代理在数据稀缺时容易过拟合且泛化能力差，增加架构复杂性在小样本场景下适得其反。

Method: 使用部分输入凸神经网络(PICNN)和保形校准将噪声视觉预测转化为凸不确定性集合，将部分可观测规划重新表述为鲁棒优化问题，实现跨环境迁移的不确定性感知策略。

Result: 在无序和顺序多目标导航任务上的广泛实验表明，NeuRO实现了最先进的性能，特别是在未见环境泛化方面表现突出。

Conclusion: NeuRO为开发鲁棒、可泛化的自主智能体提供了重要进展，解决了数据稀缺下的视觉导航泛化挑战。

Abstract: Visual navigation is a fundamental problem in embodied AI, yet practical
deployments demand long-horizon planning capabilities to address
multi-objective tasks. A major bottleneck is data scarcity: policies learned
from limited data often overfit and fail to generalize OOD. Existing neural
network-based agents typically increase architectural complexity that
paradoxically become counterproductive in the small-sample regime. This paper
introduce NeuRO, a integrated learning-to-optimize framework that tightly
couples perception networks with downstream task-level robust optimization.
Specifically, NeuRO addresses core difficulties in this integration: (i) it
transforms noisy visual predictions under data scarcity into convex uncertainty
sets using Partially Input Convex Neural Networks (PICNNs) with conformal
calibration, which directly parameterize the optimization constraints; and (ii)
it reformulates planning under partial observability as a robust optimization
problem, enabling uncertainty-aware policies that transfer across environments.
Extensive experiments on both unordered and sequential multi-object navigation
tasks demonstrate that NeuRO establishes SoTA performance, particularly in
generalization to unseen environments. Our work thus presents a significant
advancement for developing robust, generalizable autonomous agents.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising framework for
addressing robot social navigation challenges. However, inherent uncertainties
in pedestrian behavior and limited environmental interaction during training
often lead to suboptimal exploration and distributional shifts between offline
training and online deployment. To overcome these limitations, this paper
proposes a novel offline-to-online fine-tuning RL algorithm for robot social
navigation by integrating Return-to-Go (RTG) prediction into a causal
Transformer architecture. Our algorithm features a spatiotem-poral fusion model
designed to precisely estimate RTG values in real-time by jointly encoding
temporal pedestrian motion patterns and spatial crowd dynamics. This RTG
prediction framework mitigates distribution shift by aligning offline policy
training with online environmental interactions. Furthermore, a hybrid
offline-online experience sampling mechanism is built to stabilize policy
updates during fine-tuning, ensuring balanced integration of pre-trained
knowledge and real-time adaptation. Extensive experiments in simulated social
navigation environments demonstrate that our method achieves a higher success
rate and lower collision rate compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These
results underscore the efficacy of our algorithm in enhancing navigation policy
robustness and adaptability. This work paves the way for more reliable and
adaptive robotic navigation systems in real-world applications.

Conclusion: Traj2Action通过轨迹中间表示有效弥合了人类与机器人之间的形态差距，实现了从人类视频到机器人操作的成功技能迁移。

Abstract: Learning diverse manipulation skills for real-world robots is severely
bottlenecked by the reliance on costly and hard-to-scale teleoperated
demonstrations. While human videos offer a scalable alternative, effectively
transferring manipulation knowledge is fundamentally hindered by the
significant morphological gap between human and robotic embodiments. To address
this challenge and facilitate skill transfer from human to robot, we introduce
Traj2Action,a novel framework that bridges this embodiment gap by using the 3D
trajectory of the operational endpoint as a unified intermediate
representation, and then transfers the manipulation knowledge embedded in this
trajectory to the robot's actions. Our policy first learns to generate a coarse
trajectory, which forms an high-level motion plan by leveraging both human and
robot data. This plan then conditions the synthesis of precise, robot-specific
actions (e.g., orientation and gripper state) within a co-denoising framework.
Extensive real-world experiments on a Franka robot demonstrate that Traj2Action
boosts the performance by up to 27% and 22.25% over $\pi_0$ baseline on short-
and long-horizon real-world tasks, and achieves significant gains as human data
scales in robot policy learning. Our project website, featuring code and video

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段异常值检测方法，用于GNSS-RTK/INS/里程计紧耦合系统，通过多普勒测量和预积分IMU/里程计约束来检测和消除伪距异常值，提高复杂环境下的定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂环境中的GNSS定位面临非视距传播、多径效应和信号遮挡等挑战，这些因素会导致伪距测量出现大异常值，严重影响RTK定位性能和紧耦合集成导航系统的有效性。

Method: 采用两阶段异常值检测：第一阶段使用多普勒测量进行GNSS-only异常值检测；第二阶段利用预积分IMU和里程计约束生成预测的双差伪距测量，进行更精细的异常值识别和剔除。

Result: 实验结果显示，该两阶段检测框架显著减少了伪距异常值的影响，在深度城市峡谷测试中，将GNSS-RTK/INS/里程计融合的RMSE从0.52米降低到0.30米，提升了42.3%的精度。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合两个互补的检测阶段，提高了系统对粗大伪距误差和卫星测量质量下降的鲁棒性，相比代表性基线方法具有更好的定位精度和一致性。

Abstract: Reliable GNSS positioning in complex environments remains a critical
challenge due to non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation, multipath effects, and
frequent signal blockages. These effects can easily introduce large outliers
into the raw pseudo-range measurements, which significantly degrade the
performance of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) real-time kinematic
(RTK) positioning and limit the effectiveness of tightly coupled GNSS-based
integrated navigation system. To address this issue, we propose a two-stage
outlier detection method and apply the method in a tightly coupled GNSS-RTK,
inertial navigation system (INS), and odometer integration based on factor
graph optimization (FGO). In the first stage, Doppler measurements are employed
to detect pseudo-range outliers in a GNSS-only manner, since Doppler is less
sensitive to multipath and NLOS effects compared with pseudo-range, making it a
more stable reference for detecting sudden inconsistencies. In the second
stage, pre-integrated inertial measurement units (IMU) and odometer constraints
are used to generate predicted double-difference pseudo-range measurements,
which enable a more refined identification and rejection of remaining outliers.
By combining these two complementary stages, the system achieves improved
robustness against both gross pseudo-range errors and degraded satellite
measuring quality. The experimental results demonstrate that the two-stage
detection framework significantly reduces the impact of pseudo-range outliers,
and leads to improved positioning accuracy and consistency compared with
representative baseline approaches. In the deep urban canyon test, the outlier
mitigation method has limits the RMSE of GNSS-RTK/INS/odometer fusion from 0.52
m to 0.30 m, with 42.3% improvement.

Abstract: Robotic food scooping is a critical manipulation skill for food preparation
and service robots. However, existing robot learning algorithms, especially
learn-from-demonstration methods, still struggle to handle diverse and dynamic
food states, which often results in spillage and reduced reliability. In this
work, we introduce GRITS: A Spillage-Aware Guided Diffusion Policy for Robot
Food Scooping Tasks. This framework leverages guided diffusion policy to
minimize food spillage during scooping and to ensure reliable transfer of food
items from the initial to the target location. Specifically, we design a
spillage predictor that estimates the probability of spillage given current
observation and action rollout. The predictor is trained on a simulated dataset
with food spillage scenarios, constructed from four primitive shapes (spheres,
cubes, cones, and cylinders) with varied physical properties such as mass,
friction, and particle size. At inference time, the predictor serves as a
differentiable guidance signal, steering the diffusion sampling process toward
safer trajectories while preserving task success. We validate GRITS on a
real-world robotic food scooping platform. GRITS is trained on six food
categories and evaluated on ten unseen categories with different shapes and
quantities. GRITS achieves an 82% task success rate and a 4% spillage rate,
reducing spillage by over 40% compared to baselines without guidance, thereby
demonstrating its effectiveness.

Abstract: Using Large Language Models to produce intermediate thoughts, a.k.a.
Chain-of-thought (CoT), before providing an answer has been a successful recipe
for solving complex language tasks. In robotics, similar embodied CoT
strategies, generating thoughts before actions, have also been shown to lead to
improved performance when using Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs). As these
techniques increase the length of the model's generated outputs to include the
thoughts, the inference time is negatively affected. Delaying an agent's
actions in real-world executions, as in robotic manipulation settings, strongly
affects the usability of a method, as tasks require long sequences of actions.
However, is the generation of long chains-of-thought a strong prerequisite for
achieving performance improvements? In this work, we explore the idea of Hybrid
Training (HyT), a framework that enables VLAs to learn from thoughts and
benefit from the associated performance gains, while enabling the possibility
to leave out CoT generation during inference. Furthermore, by learning to
conditionally predict a diverse set of outputs, HyT supports flexibility at
inference time, enabling the model to either predict actions directly, generate
thoughts or follow instructions. We evaluate the proposed method in a series of
simulated benchmarks and real-world experiments.

Abstract: Automated driving functions increasingly rely on machine learning for tasks
like perception and trajectory planning, requiring large, relevant datasets.
The performance of these algorithms depends on how closely the training data
matches the task. To ensure reliable functioning, it is crucial to know what is
included in the dataset to assess the trained model's operational risk. We aim
to enhance the safe use of machine learning in automated driving by developing
a method to recognize situations that an automated vehicle has not been
sufficiently trained on. This method also improves explainability by describing
the dataset at a human-understandable level. We propose modeling driving data
as knowledge graphs, representing driving scenes with entities and their
relationships. These graphs are queried for specific sub-scene configurations
to check their occurrence in the dataset. We estimate a vehicle's competence in
a driving scene by considering the coverage and complexity of sub-scene
configurations in the training set. Higher complexity scenes require greater
coverage for high competence. We apply this method to the NuPlan dataset,
modeling it with knowledge graphs and analyzing the coverage of specific
driving scenes. This approach helps monitor the competence of machine learning
models trained on the dataset, which is essential for trustworthy AI to be
deployed in automated driving.

Abstract: Efficient observer design and accurate sensor fusion are key in state
estimation. This work proposes an optimization-based methodology, termed
Trajectory Based Optimization Design (TBOD), allowing the user to easily design
observers for general nonlinear systems and multi-sensor setups. Starting from
parametrized observer dynamics, the proposed method considers a finite set of
pre-recorded measurement trajectories from the nominal plant and exploits them
to tune the observer parameters through numerical optimization. This research
hinges on the classic observer's theory and Moving Horizon Estimators
methodology. Optimization is exploited to ease the observer's design, providing
the user with a lightweight, general-purpose sensor fusion methodology. TBOD's
main characteristics are the capability to handle general sensors efficiently
and in a modular way and, most importantly, its straightforward tuning
procedure. The TBOD's performance is tested on a terrestrial rover localization
problem, combining IMU and ranging sensors provided by Ultra Wide Band
antennas, and validated through a motion-capture system. Comparison with an
Extended Kalman Filter is also provided, matching its position estimation

Abstract: After years of growth, drone-based delivery is transforming logistics. At its
core, real-time 6-DoF drone pose tracking enables precise flight control and
accurate drone landing. With the widespread availability of urban 3D maps, the
Visual Positioning Service (VPS), a mobile pose estimation system, has been
adapted to enhance drone pose tracking during the landing phase, as
conventional systems like GPS are unreliable in urban environments due to
signal attenuation and multi-path propagation. However, deploying the current
VPS on drones faces limitations in both estimation accuracy and efficiency. In
this work, we redesign drone-oriented VPS with the event camera and introduce
EV-Pose to enable accurate, high-frequency 6-DoF pose tracking for accurate
drone landing. EV-Pose introduces a spatio-temporal feature-instructed pose
estimation module that extracts a temporal distance field to enable 3D point
map matching for pose estimation; and a motion-aware hierarchical fusion and
optimization scheme to enhance the above estimation in accuracy and efficiency,
by utilizing drone motion in the \textit{early stage} of event filtering and
the \textit{later stage} of pose optimization. Evaluation shows that EV-Pose
achieves a rotation accuracy of 1.34$\degree$ and a translation accuracy of
6.9$mm$ with a tracking latency of 10.08$ms$, outperforming baselines by

TL;DR: HAMLET是一个可扩展框架，通过引入时刻令牌和轻量级记忆模块，使视觉-语言-动作模型能够利用历史上下文进行动作预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人操作任务本质上是历史依赖的，但现有VLA模型仅依赖当前观察而忽略历史上下文，限制了其在需要历史信息的任务中的表现。

Method: 提出时刻令牌紧凑编码每时间步的感知信息，通过时间对比学习初始化；使用轻量级记忆模块整合历史时刻令牌为记忆特征，用于动作预测。

Result: HAMLET将GR00T N1.5在历史依赖任务上的成功率提升47.2%至76.4%；在RoboCasa Kitchen上从64.1%提升到66.4%；在LIBERO上从95.6%提升到97.7%。

Conclusion: HAMLET成功将最先进的VLA模型转变为历史感知策略，尤其在需要历史上下文的长时程任务中表现显著提升。

Abstract: Inherently, robotic manipulation tasks are history-dependent: leveraging past
context could be beneficial. However, most existing Vision-Language-Action
models (VLAs) have been designed without considering this aspect, i.e., they
rely solely on the current observation, ignoring preceding context. In this
paper, we propose HAMLET, a scalable framework to adapt VLAs to attend to the
historical context during action prediction. Specifically, we introduce moment
tokens that compactly encode perceptual information at each timestep. Their
representations are initialized with time-contrastive learning, allowing them
to better capture temporally distinctive aspects. Next, we employ a lightweight
memory module that integrates the moment tokens across past timesteps into
memory features, which are then leveraged for action prediction. Through
empirical evaluation, we show that HAMLET successfully transforms a
state-of-the-art VLA into a history-aware policy, especially demonstrating
significant improvements on long-horizon tasks that require historical context.
In particular, on top of GR00T N1.5, HAMLET achieves an average success rate of
76.4% on history-dependent real-world tasks, surpassing the baseline
performance by 47.2%. Furthermore, HAMLET pushes prior art performance from
64.1% to 66.4% on RoboCasa Kitchen (100-demo setup) and from 95.6% to 97.7% on
LIBERO, highlighting its effectiveness even under generic robot-manipulation
benchmarks.

Abstract: Human-robot collaboration (HRC) is a key focus of Industry 5.0, aiming to
enhance worker productivity while ensuring well-being. The ability to perceive
human psycho-physical states, such as stress and cognitive load, is crucial for
adaptive and human-aware robotics. This paper introduces MultiPhysio-HRC, a
multimodal dataset containing physiological, audio, and facial data collected
during real-world HRC scenarios. The dataset includes electroencephalography
(EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), electrodermal activity (EDA), respiration
(RESP), electromyography (EMG), voice recordings, and facial action units. The
dataset integrates controlled cognitive tasks, immersive virtual reality
experiences, and industrial disassembly activities performed manually and with
robotic assistance, to capture a holistic view of the participants' mental
states. Rich ground truth annotations were obtained using validated
psychological self-assessment questionnaires. Baseline models were evaluated
for stress and cognitive load classification, demonstrating the dataset's
potential for affective computing and human-aware robotics research.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出Cross-State Transition Attention Transformer，通过State Transition Attention机制学习状态演化模式来调制注意力权重，结合时序掩码训练，在机器人操作任务中显著优于标准交叉注意力和时序建模方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人操作策略在遇到训练数据未覆盖的执行变化时表现不佳，现有注意力方法处理所有历史状态但未显式建模时序结构（如失败和恢复模式）。

Method: 使用State Transition Attention机制基于学习的状态演化模式调制标准注意力权重，结合训练时的时序掩码（随机移除近期时间步的视觉信息）来促进从历史上下文中进行时序推理。

Result: 在仿真评估中，STA方法在所有任务上都一致优于标准交叉注意力和TCN、LSTM等时序建模方法，在精度关键任务上比交叉注意力提升超过2倍。

Conclusion: 提出的STA机制通过显式建模状态演化模式，结合时序掩码训练，能有效提升机器人操作策略对执行变化的适应能力。

Abstract: Learning robotic manipulation policies through supervised learning from
demonstrations remains challenging when policies encounter execution variations
not explicitly covered during training. While incorporating historical context
through attention mechanisms can improve robustness, standard approaches
process all past states in a sequence without explicitly modeling the temporal
structure that demonstrations may include, such as failure and recovery
patterns. We propose a Cross-State Transition Attention Transformer that
employs a novel State Transition Attention (STA) mechanism to modulate standard
attention weights based on learned state evolution patterns, enabling policies
to better adapt their behavior based on execution history. Our approach
combines this structured attention with temporal masking during training, where
visual information is randomly removed from recent timesteps to encourage
temporal reasoning from historical context. Evaluation in simulation shows that
STA consistently outperforms standard cross-attention and temporal modeling
approaches like TCN and LSTM networks across all tasks, achieving more than 2x
improvement over cross-attention on precision-critical tasks.

Abstract: Semantic Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a critical area of
research within robotics and computer vision, focusing on the simultaneous
localization of robotic systems and associating semantic information to
construct the most accurate and complete comprehensive model of the surrounding
environment. Since the first foundational work in Semantic SLAM appeared more
than two decades ago, this field has received increasing attention across
various scientific communities. Despite its significance, the field lacks
comprehensive surveys encompassing recent advances and persistent challenges.
In response, this study provides a thorough examination of the state-of-the-art
of Semantic SLAM techniques, with the aim of illuminating current trends and
key obstacles. Beginning with an in-depth exploration of the evolution of
visual SLAM, this study outlines its strengths and unique characteristics,
while also critically assessing previous survey literature. Subsequently, a
unified problem formulation and evaluation of the modular solution framework is
proposed, which divides the problem into discrete stages, including visual
localization, semantic feature extraction, mapping, data association, and loop
closure optimization. Moreover, this study investigates alternative
methodologies such as deep learning and the utilization of large language
models, alongside a review of relevant research about contemporary SLAM
datasets. Concluding with a discussion on potential future research directions,
this study serves as a comprehensive resource for researchers seeking to
navigate the complex landscape of Semantic SLAM.

Conclusion: 该策略成功解决了织物平整对齐的挑战，为织物生产自动化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Robotic fabric manipulation in garment production for sewing, cutting, and
ironing requires reliable flattening and alignment, yet remains challenging due
to fabric deformability, effectively infinite degrees of freedom, and frequent
occlusions from wrinkles, folds, and the manipulator's End-Effector (EE) and
arm. To address these issues, this paper proposes the first Random-to-Target
Fabric Flattening (RTFF) policy, which aligns a random wrinkled fabric state to
an arbitrary wrinkle-free target state. The proposed policy adopts a hybrid
Imitation Learning-Visual Servoing (IL-VS) framework, where IL learns with
explicit fabric models for coarse alignment of the wrinkled fabric toward a
wrinkle-free state near the target, and VS ensures fine alignment to the
target. Central to this framework is a template-based mesh that offers precise
target state representation, wrinkle-aware geometry prediction, and consistent
vertex correspondence across RTFF manipulation steps, enabling robust
manipulation and seamless IL-VS switching. Leveraging the power of mesh, a
novel IL solution for RTFF-Mesh Action Chunking Transformer (MACT)-is then
proposed by conditioning the mesh information into a Transformer-based policy.
The RTFF policy is validated on a real dual-arm tele-operation system, showing
zero-shot alignment to different targets, high accuracy, and strong
generalization across fabrics and scales. Project website:

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于PPR建模范式的产品生命周期管理方法PoPAN，将产品生命周期末端阶段的影响整合到工程阶段，支持产品在工业4.0环境中的维修、再制造和升级回收。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工业标准主要关注生产阶段而非完整产品生命周期，且侧重于生产过程而非产品本身。需要将产品生命周期末端阶段（如报废）的影响整合到工程阶段。

Method: 基于产品-过程-资源(PPR)建模范式，开发PoPAN模型作为产品的数字影子，封装在资产管理壳中，并使用AutomationML数据格式进行序列化。

Result: 通过电动汽车电池拆解和再制造用于固定电池应用的案例验证了该方法的可行性。

Conclusion: PoPAN模型能够伴随产品整个生命周期，支持循环经济原则，促进可持续制造实践。

Abstract: Current products, especially in the automotive sector, pose complex technical
systems having a multi-disciplinary mechatronic nature. Industrial standards
supporting system engineering and production typically (i) address the
production phase only, but do not cover the complete product life cycle, and
(ii) focus on production processes and resources rather than the products
themselves. The presented approach is motivated by incorporating impacts of
end-of-life phase of the product life cycle into the engineering phase. This
paper proposes a modelling approach coming up from the Product-Process-Resource
(PPR) modeling paradigm. It combines requirements on (i) respecting the product
structure as a basis for the model, and (ii) it incorporates repairing,
remanufacturing, or upcycling within cyber-physical production systems. The
proposed model called PoPAN should accompany the product during the entire life
cycle as a digital shadow encapsulated within the Asset Administration Shell of
a product. To facilitate the adoption of the proposed paradigm, the paper also
proposes serialization of the model in the AutomationML data format. The model
is demonstrated on a use-case for disassembling electric vehicle batteries to
support their remanufacturing for stationary battery applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a task-oriented computational framework to enhance
Visual-Inertial Navigation (VIN) in robots, addressing challenges such as
limited time and energy resources. The framework strategically selects visual
features using a Mean Squared Error (MSE)-based, non-submodular objective
function and a simplified dynamic anticipation model. To address the
NP-hardness of this problem, we introduce four polynomial-time approximation
algorithms: a classic greedy method with constant-factor guarantees; a low-rank
greedy variant that significantly reduces computational complexity; a
randomized greedy sampler that balances efficiency and solution quality; and a
linearization-based selector based on a first-order Taylor expansion for
near-constant-time execution. We establish rigorous performance bounds by
leveraging submodularity ratios, curvature, and element-wise curvature
analyses. Extensive experiments on both standardized benchmarks and a custom
control-aware platform validate our theoretical results, demonstrating that
these methods achieve strong approximation guarantees while enabling real-time
deployment.

Motivation: 基于扩散模型的机器人控制策略虽然表现出色，但大规模交互数据集的获取成本高昂，限制了其进一步发展。本文旨在探索不依赖额外模型训练就能提升策略性能的替代方案。

Method: 提出通用策略组合(GPC)方法，通过凸组合和测试时搜索来组合多个预训练策略的分布分数。该方法支持异构策略的组合，包括视觉动作(VA)和视觉语言动作(VLA)模型，以及基于扩散或流匹配的模型。

Abstract: Diffusion-based models for robotic control, including vision-language-action
(VLA) and vision-action (VA) policies, have demonstrated significant
capabilities. Yet their advancement is constrained by the high cost of
acquiring large-scale interaction datasets. This work introduces an alternative
paradigm for enhancing policy performance without additional model training.
Perhaps surprisingly, we demonstrate that the composed policies can exceed the
performance of either parent policy. Our contribution is threefold. First, we
establish a theoretical foundation showing that the convex composition of
distributional scores from multiple diffusion models can yield a superior
one-step functional objective compared to any individual score. A
Gr\"onwall-type bound is then used to show that this single-step improvement
propagates through entire generation trajectories, leading to systemic
performance gains. Second, motivated by these results, we propose General
Policy Composition (GPC), a training-free method that enhances performance by
combining the distributional scores of multiple pre-trained policies via a
convex combination and test-time search. GPC is versatile, allowing for the
plug-and-play composition of heterogeneous policies, including VA and VLA
models, as well as those based on diffusion or flow-matching, irrespective of
their input visual modalities. Third, we provide extensive empirical
validation. Experiments on Robomimic, PushT, and RoboTwin benchmarks, alongside
real-world robotic evaluations, confirm that GPC consistently improves
performance and adaptability across a diverse set of tasks. Further analysis of
alternative composition operators and weighting strategies offers insights into
the mechanisms underlying the success of GPC. These results establish GPC as a
simple yet effective method for improving control performance by leveraging
existing policies.

Abstract: The advent of rotor-based hopping robots has created very capable hopping
platforms with high agility and efficiency, and similar controllability, as
compared to their purely flying quadrotor counterparts. Advances in robot
performance have increased the hopping height to greater than 4 meters and
opened up the possibility for more complex aerial trajectories (i.e.,
behaviors). However, currently hopping robots do not directly control their
aerial trajectory or transition to flight, eliminating the efficiency benefits
of a hopping system. Here we show a real-time, computationally efficiency,
non-linear drag compensated, trajectory generation methodology and accompanying
Lyapunov-based controller. The combined system can create and follow complex
aerial trajectories from liftoff to touchdown on horizontal and vertical
surfaces, while maintaining strick control over the orientation at touchdown.
The computational efficiency provides broad applicability across all size
scales of hopping robots while maintaining applicability to quadrotors in
general.

case that support all dynamic updates. For more than two colors, we give
linear-time, optimal algorithms for relocation subject to a restriction on the

high probability, and runs in polylogarithmic time when the number of agents is

Abstract: Studying the impact of cooperation in strategic settings is one of the
cornerstones of algorithmic game theory. Intuitively, allowing more cooperation
yields equilibria that are more beneficial for the society of agents. However,
for many games it is still an open question how much cooperation is actually
needed to ensure socially good equilibria. We contribute to this research
endeavor by analyzing the benefits of cooperation in a network formation game
that models the creation of communication networks via the interaction of
selfish agents. In our game, agents that correspond to nodes of a network can
buy incident edges of a given weighted host graph to increase their centrality
in the formed network. The cost of an edge is proportional to its length, and
both endpoints must agree and pay for an edge to be created. This setting is
known for having a high price of anarchy.
  To uncover the impact of cooperation, we investigate the price of anarchy of
our network formation game with respect to multiple solution concepts that
allow for varying amounts of cooperation. On the negative side, we show that on
host graphs with arbitrary edge weights even the strongest form of cooperation
cannot improve the price of anarchy. In contrast to this, as our main result,
we show that cooperation has a significant positive impact if the given host
graph has metric edge weights. For this, we prove asymptotically tight bounds
on the price of anarchy via a novel proof technique that might be of
independent interest and can be applied in other models with metric weights.

Abstract: We examine formal games that we call "capital games" in which player payoffs
are known, but their payoffs are not guaranteed to be von Neumann-Morgenstern
utilities. In capital games, the dynamics of player payoffs determine their
utility functions. Different players can have different payoff dynamics. We
make no assumptions about where these dynamics come from, but implicitly assume
that they come from the players' actions and interactions over time. We define
an equilibrium concept called "growth equilibrium" and show a correspondence
between the growth equilibria of capital games and the Nash equilibria of
standard games.

TL;DR: VR通过头戴显示器引入感官扰动，影响感知和行动。研究发现VR中行动和感知阈值显著高于现实环境，主要由于传感器运动不确定性和VR引起的感知扭曲，特别是深度压缩导致的孔径感知变窄。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究沉浸式VR如何通过头戴显示器影响感知功能身体尺寸，使用可通过孔径范式来探索VR环境中的感知-行动关系。

Method: 60名参与者在物理现实和VR环境中执行行动任务（侧身通过孔径）和感知任务（调整孔径宽度直到可通过而不接触），比较两种环境下的阈值和可负担比率。

Result: VR中的行动和感知阈值显著高于现实环境，可负担比率也更高。几何建模显示VR中感知阈值的增加主要源于深度压缩，这种压缩由调节-辐辏冲突引起。

Conclusion: VR引起的深度压缩系统性改变了感知的身体-环境关系，导致功能身体尺寸感知的改变。一旦考虑VAC引起的扭曲，感知仍能功能性地适应行动能力。

Abstract: Virtual reality (VR) introduces sensory perturbations that may impact
perception and action. The current study was designed to investigate how
immersive VR presented through a head-mounted display (HMD) affects perceived
functional body size using a passable aperture paradigm. Participants (n=60)
performed an action task (sidle through apertures) and a perception task
(adjust aperture width until passable without contact) in both physical,
unmediated reality (UR) and VR. Results revealed significantly higher action
and perceptual thresholds in VR compared to UR. Affordance ratios (perceptual
threshold over action threshold) were also higher in VR, indicating that the
increase in perceptual thresholds in VR was driven partly by sensorimotor
uncertainty, as reflected in the increase in the action thresholds, and partly
by perceptual distortions imposed by VR. This perceptual overestimation in VR
also persisted as an aftereffect in UR following VR exposure. Geometrical
modelling attributed the disproportionate increase in the perceptual threshold
in VR primarily to depth compression. This compression, stemming from the
vergence-accommodation conflict (VAC), caused the virtual aperture to be
perceived as narrower than depicted, thus requiring a wider adjusted aperture.
Critically, after mathematically correcting for the VAC's impact on perceived
aperture width, the affordance ratios in VR became equivalent to those in UR.
These outcomes demonstrate a recovered invariant geometrical scaling,
suggesting that perception remained functionally attuned to action capabilities
once VAC-induced distortions were accounted for. These findings highlight that
VR-induced depth compression systematically alters perceived body-environment
relationships, leading to an altered sense of one's functional body size.

TL;DR: 研究通过真实世界实验发现，行人在与L4级自动驾驶出租车反复互动后，对AV的信任度显著提升，信任变化与互动体验和行人行为特征相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公众接受度对自动驾驶车辆推广至关重要，但以往研究多依赖简化模拟或现场测试，缺乏真实世界环境下的行人-AV互动研究。

Method: 在商业Robotaxi运营区进行真实世界实验，33名参与者在无控制城市交叉口反复与L4级Robotaxi互动，使用PBQ、PRQF、信任量表和PIS等问卷进行前后测。

Result: 实验后行人对AV的信任显著增加，信任提升与PRQF的互动成分正相关，PBQ的积极和错误子量表显著影响信任变化。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了真实世界行人-AV互动中信任形成机制，考虑了人群异质性，提供了超越实验室研究的见解。

Abstract: This study investigates how pedestrian trust, receptivity, and behavior
evolve during interactions with Level-4 autonomous vehicles (AVs) at
uncontrolled urban intersections in a naturalistic setting. While public
acceptance is critical for AV adoption, most prior studies relied on simplified
simulations or field tests. We conducted a real-world experiment in a
commercial Robotaxi operation zone, where 33 participants repeatedly crossed an
uncontrolled intersection with frequent Level-4 Robotaxi traffic. Participants
completed the Pedestrian Behavior Questionnaire (PBQ), Pedestrian Receptivity
Questionnaire for Fully AVs (PRQF), pre- and post-experiment Trust in AVs
Scale, and Personal Innovativeness Scale (PIS). Results showed that trust in
AVs significantly increased post-experiment, with the increase positively
associated with the Interaction component of PRQF. Additionally, both the
Positive and Error subscales of the PBQ significantly influenced trust change.
This study reveals how trust forms in real-world pedestrian-AV encounters,
offering insights beyond lab-based research by accounting for population
heterogeneity.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究通过介导现实技术改变棍棒的外观长度或中间缺失部分，探索用户对重量和重心的感知变化。发现长度影响重量感知（长棍感觉更轻），而中间缺失的棍棒仍被视为连续物体，重量和重心感知保持不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索介导现实（AR与DR结合）中视觉修改如何影响用户对物理对象重量和重心的感知，特别是当物体保持原有物理属性但视觉表现不同时。

Method: 进行两个用户研究（各10人），每个研究包含两个子研究。使用介导现实技术创建不同长度或中间有缺失部分的棍棒，测量用户对重量和重心的感知。

Result: 长度影响重量感知：长棍感觉更轻，短棍感觉更重。中间有缺失的棍棒仍被视为连续物体，重量和重心感知与完整棍棒相同。建立了基于报告重心的惯性力与感知重量之间的关系。

Conclusion: 介导现实的视觉修改会显著影响用户对物理对象重量和重心的感知，这种影响在动态触摸情境下遵循特定的感知规律。

Abstract: Mediated reality, where augmented reality (AR) and diminished reality (DR)
meet, enables visual modifications to real-world objects. A physical object
with a mediated reality visual change retains its original physical properties.
However, it is perceived differently from the original when interacted with. We
present such a mediated reality object, a stick with different lengths or a
stick with a missing portion in the middle, to investigate how users perceive
its weight and center of gravity. We conducted two user studies (N=10), each of
which consisted of two substudies. We found that the length of mediated reality
sticks influences the perceived weight. A longer stick is perceived as lighter,
and vice versa. The stick with a missing portion tends to be recognized as one
continuous stick. Thus, its weight and center of gravity (COG) remain the same.
We formulated the relationship between inertia based on the reported COG and
perceived weight in the context of dynamic touch.

TL;DR: 提出数据旋律化设计空间，将可视化习惯和数据结构映射到音乐修辞手法，创造更具情感影响的数据体验


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据可听化将数据映射到音高、音量等参数，但缺乏旋律、和声等音乐元素，导致声音与数据语义脱节，产生不悦体验

Method: 建立数据旋律化设计空间，将标准可视化习惯和基础数据特征映射到音乐修辞手法，通过古典音乐理论美学化数据可听化

Result: 通过音乐理论的美学化处理，使数据可听化同时具备可访问性、意义性和听觉愉悦性

Conclusion: 数据旋律化设计能够利用音乐的说服力和表现力，创造更愉悦、有意义的数据听觉体验

Abstract: We propose a design space for data melodification, where standard
visualization idioms and fundamental data characteristics map to rhetorical
devices of music for a more affective experience of data. Traditional data
sonification transforms data into sound by mapping it to different parameters
such as pitch, volume, and duration. Often and regrettably, this mapping leaves
behind melody, harmony, rhythm and other musical devices that compose the
centuries-long persuasive and expressive power of music. What results is the
occasional, unintentional sense of tinnitus and horror film-like impending doom
caused by a disconnect between the semantics of data and sound. Through this
work we ask, can the aestheticization of sonification through (classical) music
theory make data simultaneously accessible, meaningful, and pleasing to one's
ears?

TL;DR: 提出了一个双轴测试框架来评估AI代理对数据可视化口语对话的理解能力，发现文本输入模式在理解在线会议中可视化讨论方面表现最佳（96%）


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI会议助手的发展，需要评估其对对话式讨论的理解能力，特别是在数据可视化场景中

Method: 使用双轴测试框架，评估了72个关于数据可视化的口语对话语料，比较了不同管道和模型架构（LLM vs VLM）以及不同可视化输入格式（图表图像、源代码或混合）

Result: 纯文本输入模式在理解可视化讨论方面取得了最佳性能（96%）

Conclusion: 在理解在线会议中关于数据可视化的口语对话方面，文本输入方式优于视觉输入方式

Abstract: In this short paper, we present work evaluating an AI agent's understanding
of spoken conversations about data visualizations in an online meeting
scenario. There is growing interest in the development of AI-assistants that
support meetings, such as by providing assistance with tasks or summarizing a
discussion. The quality of this support depends on a model that understands the
conversational dialogue. To evaluate this understanding, we introduce a
dual-axis testing framework for diagnosing the AI agent's comprehension of
spoken conversations about data. Using this framework, we designed a series of
tests to evaluate understanding of a novel corpus of 72 spoken conversational
dialogues about data visualizations. We examine diverse pipelines and model
architectures, LLM vs VLM, and diverse input formats for visualizations (the
chart image, its underlying source code, or a hybrid of both) to see how this
affects model performance on our tests. Using our evaluation methods, we found
that text-only input modalities achieved the best performance (96%) in
understanding discussions of visualizations in online meetings.

*Paul C. Parsons*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文探讨了可视化在现实工作环境中作为基础设施的"安静"角色，主张当可视化融入专家实践并变得不可见时，不应被视为设计失败，而需要新的理论和方法来支持这种使用方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可视化研究通常关注视觉表示如何产生洞察、指导解释或支持决策，但在许多现实领域，可视化会融入背景，成为日常工作基础设施的一部分。本文旨在认真对待这种安静角色。

Method: 借鉴联合认知系统、自然决策和基础设施研究的理论传统，通过NASA任务控制操作的案例，分析可视化如何嵌入专家实践节奏中。

Result: 研究表明，在NASA任务控制中，可视化深度集成但很少被质疑，它们作为注意力、协调和判断的支架而非干预场所。

Conclusion: 可视化的基础设施存在需要新的概念、方法和批判意识，目标不是削弱可视化的重要性，而是扩展该领域的理论库，即使当可视化从视野中消失时也能识别和支持其使用。

Abstract: Visualization research often centers on how visual representations generate
insight, guide interpretation, or support decision-making. But in many
real-world domains, visualizations do not stand out--they recede into the
background, stabilized and trusted as part of the everyday infrastructure of
work. This paper explores what it means to take such quiet roles seriously.
Drawing on theoretical traditions from joint cognitive systems, naturalistic
decision making, and infrastructure studies, I examine how visualization can
become embedded in the rhythms of expert practice--less a site of intervention
than a scaffold for attention, coordination, and judgment. I illustrate this
reorientation with examples from mission control operations at NASA, where
visualizations are deeply integrated but rarely interrogated. Rather than treat
invisibility as a failure of design or innovation, I argue that visualization's
infrastructural presence demands new concepts, methods, and critical
sensibilities. The goal is not to diminish visualization's importance, but to
broaden the field's theoretical repertoire--to recognize and support
visualization-in-use even when it fades from view.

*T. James Brandt*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个评估框架，用于平衡聊天机器人语言风格适应中的即时同步性和长期稳定性，通过多种策略在多个数据集上验证，发现边界策略能在保持高稳定性的同时仅轻微降低同步性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自适应聊天机器人模仿用户语言风格可以建立融洽关系，但无限制模仿可能导致代理不稳定或谄媚，需要平衡即时语言同步和长期角色稳定性。

Method: 使用8维风格向量和闭环"基础+增量"提示架构，在人类日志数据集上模拟比较多种适应策略（无限制、上限、指数移动平均、死区、混合策略）。

Result: 边界策略在稳定性方面实现显著提升（从0.542到0.878，+62%），而同步性仅减少17%。在三个公共语料库和两种模型家族上验证了这一权衡。

Conclusion: 该框架为风格适应提供了通用评估工具，识别了帕累托有效策略，并通过新颖的可读性指标将策略选择与系统可维护性联系起来。

Abstract: Adaptive chatbots that mimic a user's linguistic style can build rapport and
engagement, yet unconstrained mimicry risks an agent that feels unstable or
sycophantic. We present a computational evaluation framework that makes the
core design tension explicit: balancing moment-to-moment linguistic synchrony
against long-term persona stability. Using an 8-dimensional style vector and a
closed-loop "base+delta" prompting architecture, we simulate and compare
explicit adaptation policies - Uncapped, Cap, Exponential Moving Average (EMA),
Dead-Band, and Hybrids - on a human-log dataset. Our analysis maps a clear
Pareto frontier: bounded policies achieve substantial gains in stability at a
modest cost to synchrony. For example, a Hybrid (EMA+Cap) raises stability from
0.542 to 0.878 (+62%) while reducing synchrony by only 17%. We confirm this
trade-off through large-scale replications on three public corpora
(DailyDialog, Persona-Chat, EmpatheticDialogues) and LLM-in-the-loop validation
across two model families. Furthermore, we quantify "prompt legibility,"
showing that frontier policies reduce instruction churn and cut jarring
register flips (major tone changes) from 0.254 to 0.092, yielding systems that
are easier to reason about and maintain. Taken together, our framework provides
a general evaluation harness for style adaptation; a systematic ablation that
identifies Pareto-efficient policies; robust validation across diverse datasets
and models; and novel legibility metrics linking policy choices to system
maintainability.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于风水迷信的伪理论框架，将迷信式启发法融入可视化设计，通过文化共鸣的叙事和象征隐喻来鼓励良好的设计实践。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受风水这一古老中国迷信启发，探索如何利用迷信式启发法为可视化设计提供心理动机和说服框架，而非追求经验真理。

Method: 将可视化设计原则重新表述为风水罗盘，在引人入胜的神话框架中重新构建经验设计原则和指南。

Result: 展示了可视化设计原则如何在风水叙事中解释，这些隐喻原则有潜力减少设计师焦虑、培养社区规范、增强可视化设计指南的记忆性和内化。

Conclusion: 风水可视化理论可作为一套认知捷径，通过类似信仰的趣味活动发挥说服力，促进设计实践。

Abstract: Superstition and religious belief system have historically shaped human
behavior, offering powerful psychological motivations and persuasive frameworks
to guide actions. Inspired by Feng Shui -- an ancient Chinese superstition --
this paper proposes a pseudo-theoretical framework that integrates
superstition-like heuristics into visualization design. Rather than seeking
empirical truth, this framework leverages culturally resonant (superstitious)
narratives and symbolic metaphors as persuasive tools to encourage desirable
design practices, such as clarity, accessibility, and audience-centered
thinking. We articulate a set of visualization designs into a Feng Shui
compass, reframing empirical design principles and guidelines within an engaing
mythology. We present how visualization design principles can be intepreted in
Feng Shui narratives, discussing the potential of these metaphorical principles
in reducing designer anxiety, fostering community norms, and enhancing the
memorability and internalization of visualization design guidelines. Finally,
we discuss Feng Shui visualization theory as a set of cognitive shortcuts that
can exert persuasive power through playful, belief-like activities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI问答系统虽然会提供来源归因，但用户难以实际验证这些归因内容的准确性，需要一种更实用的验证方法。

Method: 开发了归因梯度系统，将回答句子分解为具体声明，为每个声明挖掘源文档中的支持性和矛盾性证据片段，并允许用户通过点击片段深入查看源文档上下文。

Result: 可用性研究显示，使用归因梯度的用户在修改AI回答时表现出更高的源文档参与度和更丰富的修订内容。

Conclusion: 归因梯度通过提供分层的证据验证机制，有效提升了用户对AI回答归因的验证能力和参与度。

Abstract: AI question answering systems increasingly generate responses with
attributions to sources. However, the task of verifying the actual content of
these attributions is in most cases impractical. In this paper, we present
attribution gradients as a solution. Attribution gradients provide integrated,
incremental affordances for diving into an attributed passage. A user can
decompose a sentence of an answer into its claims. For each claim, the user can
view supporting and contradictory excerpts mined from sources. Those excerpts
serve as clickable conduits into the source (in our application, scientific
papers). When evidence itself contains more citations, the UI unpacks the
evidence into excerpts from the cited sources. These features of attribution
gradients facilitate concurrent interconnections among answer, claim, excerpt,
and context. In a usability study, we observed greater engagement with sources
and richer revision in a task where participants revised an attributed AI
answer with attribution gradients and a baseline.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了增强现实(AR)中视觉编码和视角对运动引导性能的影响，针对不同可见性和运动平面的动作提供了基于实证的设计指南。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AR设计指南主要关注用户视野内的简单上半身动作，缺乏针对不同可见性和方向性动作的实证设计建议。

Method: 通过实验研究，使用三种不同可见性和运动平面的动作，比较不同视觉编码和视角对运动引导性能和可用性的影响。

Result: 发现不同设计在偏好和性能上存在显著差异，最佳视角取决于动作可见性，且显示更多整体运动信息并不一定能改善动作执行。

Conclusion: 提供了基于实证的沉浸式交互可视化设计指南，以支持更有效的AR运动引导系统。

Abstract: Augmented reality (AR) offers promising opportunities to support
movement-based activities, such as personal training or physical therapy, with
real-time, spatially-situated visual cues. While many approaches leverage AR to
guide motion, existing design guidelines focus on simple, upper-body movements
within the user's field of view. We lack evidence-based design recommendations
for guiding more diverse scenarios involving movements with varying levels of
visibility and direction. We conducted an experiment to investigate how
different visual encodings and perspectives affect motion guidance performance
and usability, using three exercises that varied in visibility and planes of
motion. Our findings reveal significant differences in preference and
performance across designs. Notably, the best perspective varied depending on
motion visibility and showing more information about the overall motion did not
necessarily improve motion execution. We provide empirically-grounded
guidelines for designing immersive, interactive visualizations for motion
guidance to support more effective AR systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前约会技术主要关注配对而非关系维持，缺乏对长期关系动态的理解和预测能力。

Method: 使用两个角色对齐的LLM代理（每个伴侣一个），在集中式场景主控下互动，将关键转折点建模为紧凑的现实选项集，推断可解释的状态变化和可审计的承诺估计。

Result: 在71对情侣的纵向数据集上，模拟感知预测优于仅基于角色的基线，并识别出可操作的关系标记（如修复尝试被承认、清晰度变化）来解释轨迹分歧。

Conclusion: RELATE-Sim将关系研究重点从匹配转向维护，为理解和预测长期关系动态提供了透明、可扩展的平台。

Abstract: Most dating technologies optimize for getting together, not staying together.
We present RELATE-Sim, a theory-grounded simulator that models how couples
behave at consequential turning points-exclusivity talks, conflict-and-repair
episodes, relocations-rather than static traits. Two persona-aligned LLM agents
(one per partner) interact under a centralized Scene Master that frames each
turning point as a compact set of realistic options, advances the narrative,
and infers interpretable state changes and an auditable commitment estimate
after each scene. On a longitudinal dataset of 71 couples with two-year
follow-ups, simulation-aware predictions outperform a personas-only baseline
while surfacing actionable markers (e.g., repair attempts acknowledged, clarity
shifts) that explain why trajectories diverge. RELATE-Sim pushes the
relationship research's focus from matchmaking to maintenance, providing a
transparent, extensible platform for understanding and forecasting long-term
relationship dynamics.

Motivation: 解决传统静态界面的局限性，利用情绪感知技术创建更智能、个性化的用户界面。

Method: 整合数字图像处理、人脸识别和情绪检测技术，通过摄像头实时捕捉用户表情数据来动态调整UI。

Result: 案例研究显示85.7%的用户认为该系统具有吸引力且用户友好，用户调查证实了对自适应界面的强烈需求。

Conclusion: 情绪驱动的UI自适应技术具有巨大潜力，能够显著改善各种应用中的用户体验。

Abstract: This paper presents Face2Feel, a novel user interface (UI) model that
dynamically adapts to user emotions and preferences captured through computer
vision. This adaptive UI framework addresses the limitations of traditional
static interfaces by integrating digital image processing, face recognition,
and emotion detection techniques. Face2Feel analyzes user expressions utilizing
a webcam or pre-installed camera as the primary data source to personalize the
UI in real-time. Although dynamically changing user interfaces based on
emotional states are not yet widely implemented, their advantages and the
demand for such systems are evident. This research contributes to the
development of emotion-aware applications, particularly in recommendation
systems and feedback mechanisms. A case study, "Shresta: Emotion-Based Book
Recommendation System," demonstrates the practical implementation of this
framework, the technologies employed, and the system's usefulness. Furthermore,
a user survey conducted after presenting the working model reveals a strong
demand for such adaptive interfaces, emphasizing the importance of user
satisfaction and comfort in human-computer interaction. The results showed that
nearly 85.7\% of the users found these systems to be very engaging and
user-friendly. This study underscores the potential for emotion-driven UI
adaptation to improve user experiences across various applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示工程方法要么需要大量努力和专业知识，要么缺乏交互指导，限制了LLM在实际应用中的生产力增益。

Method: 设计并评估PromptPilot交互式提示助手，基于四个实证设计目标，通过80名参与者的随机对照实验完成三个现实工作相关写作任务。

Result: 使用PromptPilot的参与者表现显著更高（中位数：78.3 vs 61.7；p = .045，d = 0.56），并报告了更高的效率、易用性和自主性。

Conclusion: 研究结果实证验证了所提出的设计目标的有效性，确立了LLM增强的提示工程作为改进人机协作的可行技术。

Abstract: Effective prompt engineering is critical to realizing the promised
productivity gains of large language models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive
tasks. Yet, many users struggle to craft prompts that yield high-quality
outputs, limiting the practical benefits of LLMs. Existing approaches, such as
prompt handbooks or automated optimization pipelines, either require
substantial effort, expert knowledge, or lack interactive guidance. To address
this gap, we design and evaluate PromptPilot, an interactive prompting
assistant grounded in four empirically derived design objectives for
LLM-enhanced prompt engineering. We conducted a randomized controlled
experiment with 80 participants completing three realistic, work-related
writing tasks. Participants supported by PromptPilot achieved significantly
higher performance (median: 78.3 vs. 61.7; p = .045, d = 0.56), and reported
enhanced efficiency, ease-of-use, and autonomy during interaction. These
findings empirically validate the effectiveness of our proposed design
objectives, establishing LLM-enhanced prompt engineering as a viable technique
for improving human-AI collaboration.

Motivation: 传统葡萄酒品鉴在非西方文化背景下存在文化共鸣不足的问题，需要为中文消费者设计更具文化适应性的品鉴体验。

Method: 采用情境共创的服务设计方法，进行26个现场访谈和后续验证会议，识别用户原型，开发基于本地美食的跨模态隐喻系统原型。

Result: 识别出三种用户原型：好奇品尝者、体验追求者和知识构建者；基于本地美食的隐喻显著提升了认知和情感参与度；原型系统在小规模可用性评估中证实了改进效果。

Conclusion: 研究表明文化适应性交互系统能够增强实体消费体验，为多模态和情感感知的品鉴系统提供了新的设计视角。

Abstract: Wine tasting is a multimodal and culturally embedded activity that presents
unique challenges when adapted to non-Western contexts. This paper proposes a
service design approach rooted in contextual co-creation to reimagine wine
tasting experiences for Chinese consumers. Drawing on 26 in-situ interviews and
follow-up validation sessions, we identify three distinct user archetypes:
Curious Tasters, Experience Seekers, and Knowledge Builders, each exhibiting
different needs in vocabulary, interaction, and emotional pacing. Our findings
reveal that traditional wine descriptors lack cultural resonance and that
cross-modal metaphors grounded in local gastronomy (e.g., green mango for
acidity) significantly improve cognitive and emotional engagement. These
insights informed a partially implemented prototype, featuring AI-driven
metaphor-to-flavour mappings and real-time affective feedback visualisation. A
small-scale usability evaluation confirmed improvements in engagement and
comprehension. Our comparative analysis shows alignment with and
differentiation from prior multimodal and affect-aware tasting systems. This
research contributes to CBMI by demonstrating how culturally adaptive
interaction systems can enhance embodied consumption experiences in physical
tourism and beyond.

Abstract: Understanding human affect can be used in robotics, marketing, education,
human-computer interaction, healthcare, entertainment, autonomous driving, and
psychology to enhance decision-making, personalize experiences, and improve
emotional well-being. This work presents a comprehensive overview of affect
inference datasets that utilize continuous valence and arousal labels. We
reviewed 25 datasets published between 2008 and 2024, examining key factors
such as dataset size, subject distribution, sensor configurations, annotation
scales, and data formats for valence and arousal values. While camera-based
datasets dominate the field, we also identified several widely used multimodal
combinations. Additionally, we explored the most common approaches to affect
detection applied to these datasets, providing insights into the prevailing
methodologies in the field. Our overview of sensor fusion approaches shows
promising advancements in model improvement for valence and arousal inference.

Motivation: AI的普及引发了训练数据、模型接口、下游应用等多方面的隐私担忧，需要了解开发者如何看待这些风险及应对策略。

Method: 访谈了25位欧洲的AI开发者，分析他们对隐私威胁的认知和防护策略的看法。

Result: AI开发者在隐私风险相对排名上缺乏共识，差异源于人类因素而非纯技术因素；虽然了解缓解策略但实际采用很少。

Conclusion: 研究发现存在赋能AI开发者更好应对隐私风险的差距和机遇，需要加强实践层面的支持。

Abstract: The proliferation of AI has sparked privacy concerns related to training
data, model interfaces, downstream applications, and more. We interviewed 25 AI
developers based in Europe to understand which privacy threats they believe
pose the greatest risk to users, developers, and businesses and what protective
strategies, if any, would help to mitigate them. We find that there is little
consensus among AI developers on the relative ranking of privacy risks. These
differences stem from salient reasoning patterns that often relate to human
rather than purely technical factors. Furthermore, while AI developers are
aware of proposed mitigation strategies for addressing these risks, they
reported minimal real-world adoption. Our findings highlight both gaps and
opportunities for empowering AI developers to better address privacy risks in
AI.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究尼泊尔性贩运幸存者的处境，特别是在非政府组织保护性居住环境中的康复过程，旨在通过创新的研究方法更好地倾听幸存者的声音。

Method: 采用改良的社区化照片启发法，将社交性置于方法的核心，减轻幸存者作为个体发声的压力，使其能够更自然地表达。

Result: 揭示了幸存者在康复过程中面临的复杂处境，以及他们向"新常态"生活过渡的挑战；发现幸存者拥有有限但重要的社会资本，可在某些领域帮助重新融入社会。

Conclusion: 社区化照片启发法是敏感环境下激发价值观的有效方法；幸存者的价值观和未来机会认知表明他们具备可支持社会重新融入的社会资本；研究为HCI和CSCW领域理解贩运幸存者特定关切提供了见解。

Abstract: We report on an initial ethnographic exploration of the situation of
sex-trafficking survivors in Nepal. In the course of studying trafficking
survivors in a protected-living situation created by a non-governmental
organization in Nepal, we adapted photo-elicitation to hear the voices of the
survivors by making the technique more communal. Bringing sociality to the
forefront of the method reduced the pressure on survivors to assert voices as
individuals, allowing them to speak. We make three contributions to research.
First, we propose a communal form of photo-elicitation as a method to elicit
values in sensitive settings. Second, we present the complex circumstances of
the survivors as they undergo rehabilitation and move towards life with a ``new
normal''. Third, our work adds to HCI and CSCW literature on understanding
specific concerns of trafficking survivors and aims to inform designs that can
support reintegration of survivors in society. The values that the survivors
hold and their notion of future opportunities suggest possession of limited but
important social capital in some domains that could be leveraged to aid
reintegration.
