### [1] [YOLO11-CR: a Lightweight Convolution-and-Attention Framework for Accurate Fatigue Driving Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13205)
*Zhebin Jin,Ligang Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出YOLO11-CR轻量级目标检测模型，用于实时疲劳检测，通过CAFM和RCM模块提升特征表达和空间定位能力，在DSM数据集上表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有疲劳检测方法存在侵入性、硬件依赖和鲁棒性不足的问题，视觉方法面临小目标检测困难和多尺度特征建模有限的挑战

Method: YOLO11-CR模型包含卷积-注意力融合模块(CAFM)整合CNN局部特征和Transformer全局上下文，以及矩形校准模块(RCM)捕获水平和垂直上下文信息

Result: 在DSM数据集上达到87.17%精确率、83.86%召回率、88.09% mAP@50和55.93% mAP@50-95，显著优于基线模型

Conclusion: YOLO11-CR为车载疲劳监控提供了实用高效解决方案，具有实际部署潜力，未来可扩展时间建模、多模态数据集成和嵌入式优化

Abstract: Driver fatigue detection is of paramount importance for intelligent
transportation systems due to its critical role in mitigating road traffic
accidents. While physiological and vehicle dynamics-based methods offer
accuracy, they are often intrusive, hardware-dependent, and lack robustness in
real-world environments. Vision-based techniques provide a non-intrusive and
scalable alternative, but still face challenges such as poor detection of small
or occluded objects and limited multi-scale feature modeling. To address these
issues, this paper proposes YOLO11-CR, a lightweight and efficient object
detection model tailored for real-time fatigue detection. YOLO11-CR introduces
two key modules: the Convolution-and-Attention Fusion Module (CAFM), which
integrates local CNN features with global Transformer-based context to enhance
feature expressiveness; and the Rectangular Calibration Module (RCM), which
captures horizontal and vertical contextual information to improve spatial
localization, particularly for profile faces and small objects like mobile
phones. Experiments on the DSM dataset demonstrated that YOLO11-CR achieves a
precision of 87.17%, recall of 83.86%, mAP@50 of 88.09%, and mAP@50-95 of
55.93%, outperforming baseline models significantly. Ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of the CAFM and RCM modules in improving both
sensitivity and localization accuracy. These results demonstrate that YOLO11-CR
offers a practical and high-performing solution for in-vehicle fatigue
monitoring, with strong potential for real-world deployment and future
enhancements involving temporal modeling, multi-modal data integration, and
embedded optimization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Mirage基准和Mirage-R1模型，用于解决真实世界中AI生成图像检测的挑战，在基准测试中领先现有方法5-10%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI生成图像检测器在实验室环境下有效，但无法泛化到真实世界的复杂场景，真实图像存在噪声、多源生成模型和后期编辑等问题

Method: 构建Mirage基准数据集（包含互联网收集和专家合成数据），开发Mirage-R1视觉语言模型，采用启发式到分析式推理机制，两阶段训练（监督微调+强化学习），推理时自适应思考策略

Result: 在Mirage基准和公共基准上分别领先最先进检测器5%和10%

Conclusion: Mirage基准有效模拟真实世界AI生成图像的复杂性，Mirage-R1模型通过反射推理机制在检测性能和推理速度之间取得良好平衡

Abstract: The spreading of AI-generated images (AIGI), driven by advances in generative
AI, poses a significant threat to information security and public trust.
Existing AIGI detectors, while effective against images in clean laboratory
settings, fail to generalize to in-the-wild scenarios. These real-world images
are noisy, varying from ``obviously fake" images to realistic ones derived from
multiple generative models and further edited for quality control. We address
in-the-wild AIGI detection in this paper. We introduce Mirage, a challenging
benchmark designed to emulate the complexity of in-the-wild AIGI. Mirage is
constructed from two sources: (1) a large corpus of Internet-sourced AIGI
verified by human experts, and (2) a synthesized dataset created through the
collaboration between multiple expert generators, closely simulating the
realistic AIGI in the wild. Building on this benchmark, we propose Mirage-R1, a
vision-language model with heuristic-to-analytic reasoning, a reflective
reasoning mechanism for AIGI detection. Mirage-R1 is trained in two stages: a
supervised-fine-tuning cold start, followed by a reinforcement learning stage.
By further adopting an inference-time adaptive thinking strategy, Mirage-R1 is
able to provide either a quick judgment or a more robust and accurate
conclusion, effectively balancing inference speed and performance. Extensive
experiments show that our model leads state-of-the-art detectors by 5% and 10%
on Mirage and the public benchmark, respectively. The benchmark and code will
be made publicly available.

### [3] [DianJin-OCR-R1: Enhancing OCR Capabilities via a Reasoning-and-Tool Interleaved Vision-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13238)
*Qian Chen,Xianyin Zhang,Lifan Guo,Feng Chen,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DianJin-OCR-R1是一个推理增强的视觉语言模型框架，通过结合自身OCR能力和专家模型工具来解决大视觉语言模型在文档图像解析中的幻觉问题，在ReST和OmniDocBench基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大视觉语言模型在端到端文档图像解析方面表现出色，但存在幻觉问题（生成输入图像中不存在的文字），且在OCR任务上不如专门训练的专家模型有效。

Method: 提出推理增强框架DianJin-OCR-R1，模型首先利用自身OCR能力识别图像内容，然后调用专家模型工具获取参考结果，最后重新审视图像并反思推理过程以提供最终识别结果。

Result: 在ReST和OmniDocBench基准测试中，DianJin-OCR-R1模型持续优于非推理对应模型和专家OCR模型，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过推理与工具交织的方法，DianJin-OCR-R1成功缓解了LVLMs的幻觉问题，以较低成本实现了性能提升，为视觉语言模型在OCR任务中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have enabled a new
paradigm of end-to-end document image parsing, excelling in Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) tasks such as text, table, and formula recognition. However,
generative LVLMs, similarly to large language models (LLMs), are prone to
hallucinations--generating words that do not exist in input images.
Furthermore, LVLMs are designed for general purposes and tend to be less
effective on OCR tasks compared to expert models that are trained on
domain-specific datasets. In this paper, we propose DianJin-OCR-R1, a
reasoning-enhanced framework designed to address these limitations through
training reasoning-and-tool interleaved VLMs. Given a recognition instruction,
our DianJin-OCR-R1 model first recognizes the content in the input image by its
own OCR capabilities, and then calls other tools (i.e., other expert models) to
obtain their results as references, finally looks again the image and rethinks
about the reasoning process to provide the final recognized content. Since
architectures of expert models are tailored for specific OCR tasks, which makes
them less prone to hallucinations, their results can help VLMs mitigate
hallucinations. Additionally, expert models are typically smaller in scale and
easy to iterate, enabling performance improvements for VLMs at a lower cost. We
evaluate our model on ReST and OmniDocBench, and experimental results show that
our DianJin-OCR-R1 models consistently outperform their non-reasoning
counterparts and expert OCR models, which proves the effectiveness of our
method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于卷积神经网络的乌尔都语光学字符识别系统，通过组件分类和自动特征学习技术，在乌尔都语文本数据集上实现了99%的组件分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乌尔都语作为草书文字语言，具有复杂的几何和形态结构，传统分割方法错误率高，需要开发更有效的识别技术。

Method: 使用卷积神经网络进行组件分类，通过字符排列组合生成数据集，应用连通分量技术提取连字，采用两级分层神经网络处理字符排列和组件分类。

Result: 模型在组件分类任务上成功实现了99%的高准确率。

Conclusion: 基于CNN的组件分类方法为乌尔都语OCR提供了一种有效的解决方案，避免了传统分割方法的高错误率问题。

Abstract: Urdu is a cursive script language and has similarities with Arabic and many
other South Asian languages. Urdu is difficult to classify due to its complex
geometrical and morphological structure. Character classification can be
processed further if segmentation technique is efficient, but due to context
sensitivity in Urdu, segmentation-based recognition often results with high
error rate. Our proposed approach for Urdu optical character recognition system
is a component-based classification relying on automatic feature learning
technique called convolutional neural network. CNN is trained and tested on
Urdu text dataset, which is generated through permutation process of three
characters and further proceeds to discarding unnecessary images by applying
connected component technique in order to obtain ligature only. Hierarchical
neural network is implemented with two levels to deal with three degrees of
character permutations and component classification Our model successfully
achieved 0.99% for component classification.

### [5] [CLoE: Curriculum Learning on Endoscopic Images for Robust MES Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13280)
*Zeynep Ozdemir,Hacer Yalim Keles,Omer Ozgur Tanriover*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLoE是一个课程学习框架，通过图像质量评估标签可靠性并结合有序结构，提高溃疡性结肠炎内镜图像严重程度分类的准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 梅奥内镜评分(MES)分类面临标签噪声和有序性结构挑战，传统模型常忽略这些因素，需要开发能同时处理标签可靠性和有序结构的框架

Method: 使用轻量级模型评估图像质量作为标签置信度代理，构建从易到难的课程学习顺序，结合ResizeMix数据增强，在CNN和Transformer架构上验证

Result: 在LIMUC和HyperKvasir数据集上，ConvNeXt-Tiny达到82.5%准确率和0.894 QWK，性能优于强监督和自监督基线

Conclusion: 难度感知训练策略能有效改善标签不确定性下的有序分类问题，具有实际应用潜力

Abstract: Estimating disease severity from endoscopic images is essential in assessing
ulcerative colitis, where the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) is widely used to
grade inflammation. However, MES classification remains challenging due to
label noise from inter-observer variability and the ordinal nature of the
score, which standard models often ignore. We propose CLoE, a curriculum
learning framework that accounts for both label reliability and ordinal
structure. Image quality, estimated via a lightweight model trained on Boston
Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) labels, is used as a proxy for annotation
confidence to order samples from easy (clean) to hard (noisy). This curriculum
is further combined with ResizeMix augmentation to improve robustness.
Experiments on the LIMUC and HyperKvasir datasets, using both CNNs and
Transformers, show that CLoE consistently improves performance over strong
supervised and self-supervised baselines. For instance, ConvNeXt-Tiny reaches
82.5\% accuracy and a QWK of 0.894 on LIMUC with low computational cost. These
results highlight the potential of difficulty-aware training strategies for
improving ordinal classification under label uncertainty. Code will be released
at https://github.com/zeynepozdemir/CLoE.

### [6] [Timestep-Compressed Attack on Spiking Neural Networks through Timestep-Level Backpropagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13812)
*Donghwa Kang,Doohyun Kim,Sang-Ki Ko,Jinkyu Lee,Hyeongboo Baek,Brent ByungHoon Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出TCA框架，通过时间步压缩显著降低SNN对抗攻击延迟，包含TLBP和A-MPR两个组件，在保持攻击成功率的同时减少56%以上的攻击延迟


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于梯度的SNN对抗攻击方法存在严重延迟问题，无法满足实时应用需求，这些方法直接扩展ANN范式，未能充分利用SNN的关键特性

Method: TCA框架包含两个核心组件：1) 时间步级反向传播(TLBP) - 基于发现全局时间信息对攻击成功不关键，支持逐时间步评估和早期停止；2) 对抗性膜电位重用(A-MPR) - 利用初始时间步膜电位积累可预计算和重用的特性

Result: 在VGG-11和ResNet-17上使用CIFAR-10/100和CIFAR10-DVS数据集测试，TCA在白盒和黑盒设置下分别减少56.6%和57.1%的攻击延迟，同时保持相当的攻击成功率

Conclusion: TCA框架通过有效利用SNN特性显著降低了对抗攻击的延迟，为SNN在实时应用中的安全部署提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) gradient-based adversarial attacks on spiking neural
networks (SNNs), which largely rely on extending FGSM and PGD frameworks, face
a critical limitation: substantial attack latency from multi-timestep
processing, rendering them infeasible for practical real-time applications.
This inefficiency stems from their design as direct extensions of ANN
paradigms, which fail to exploit key SNN properties. In this paper, we propose
the timestep-compressed attack (TCA), a novel framework that significantly
reduces attack latency. TCA introduces two components founded on key insights
into SNN behavior. First, timestep-level backpropagation (TLBP) is based on our
finding that global temporal information in backpropagation to generate
perturbations is not critical for an attack's success, enabling per-timestep
evaluation for early stopping. Second, adversarial membrane potential reuse
(A-MPR) is motivated by the observation that initial timesteps are
inefficiently spent accumulating membrane potential, a warm-up phase that can
be pre-calculated and reused. Our experiments on VGG-11 and ResNet-17 with the
CIFAR-10/100 and CIFAR10-DVS datasets show that TCA significantly reduces the
required attack latency by up to 56.6% and 57.1% compared to SOTA methods in
white-box and black-box settings, respectively, while maintaining a comparable
attack success rate.

*Sirshapan Mitra,Yogesh S. Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaitCrafter是一个基于扩散模型的步态序列生成框架，能够在轮廓域合成逼真的步态数据，支持多种条件控制，并能生成新身份数据以保护隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决步态识别中大规模标注数据集缺乏、多样化步态样本收集困难以及隐私保护的问题。

Method: 训练视频扩散模型，专门处理步态轮廓数据，支持基于服装、携带物品、视角等多种条件的可控生成，并通过身份嵌入插值生成新身份。

Result: 合成的步态样本能够提升步态识别性能，特别是在挑战性条件下；生成的新身份数据具有独特且一致的步态模式。

Conclusion: 该工作推动了扩散模型在高质量、可控且隐私保护的步态数据生成方面的应用。

Abstract: Gait recognition is a valuable biometric task that enables the identification
of individuals from a distance based on their walking patterns. However, it
remains limited by the lack of large-scale labeled datasets and the difficulty
of collecting diverse gait samples for each individual while preserving
privacy. To address these challenges, we propose GaitCrafter, a diffusion-based
framework for synthesizing realistic gait sequences in the silhouette domain.
Unlike prior works that rely on simulated environments or alternative
generative models, GaitCrafter trains a video diffusion model from scratch,
exclusively on gait silhouette data. Our approach enables the generation of
temporally consistent and identity-preserving gait sequences. Moreover, the
generation process is controllable-allowing conditioning on various covariates
such as clothing, carried objects, and view angle. We show that incorporating
synthetic samples generated by GaitCrafter into the gait recognition pipeline
leads to improved performance, especially under challenging conditions.
Additionally, we introduce a mechanism to generate novel identities-synthetic
individuals not present in the original dataset-by interpolating identity
embeddings. These novel identities exhibit unique, consistent gait patterns and
are useful for training models while maintaining privacy of real subjects.
Overall, our work takes an important step toward leveraging diffusion models
for high-quality, controllable, and privacy-aware gait data generation.

### [8] [Prune2Drive: A Plug-and-Play Framework for Accelerating Vision-Language Models in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13305)
*Minhao Xiong,Zichen Wen,Zhuangcheng Gu,Xuyang Liu,Rui Zhang,Hengrui Kang,Jiabing Yang,Junyuan Zhang,Weijia Li,Conghui He,Yafei Wang,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Prune2Drive是一个即插即用的视觉token剪枝框架，用于自动驾驶中的多视角视觉语言模型，通过多样性感知token选择和视图自适应剪枝控制，在保持性能的同时显著提升推理速度和减少内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在自动驾驶中处理高分辨率多视角图像时会产生大量视觉token，导致计算开销巨大、推理延迟高和内存消耗大，阻碍了实际部署。

Method: 提出两种核心创新：1）受最远点采样启发的多样性感知token选择机制，优先考虑跨视图的语义和空间覆盖；2）视图自适应剪枝控制器，根据每个摄像头视图对下游驾驶任务的重要性学习最优剪枝比例。

Result: 在两个大规模多视角驾驶基准测试中，仅保留10%视觉token时，预填充阶段实现6.4倍加速，FLOPs消耗降至13.4%，性能仅下降3%。

Conclusion: Prune2Drive无需模型重训练或注意力图访问，与现代高效注意力实现兼容，为多视角视觉语言模型在自动驾驶中的高效部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm in
autonomous driving (AD), offering a unified framework for perception,
reasoning, and decision-making by jointly modeling visual inputs and natural
language instructions. However, their deployment is hindered by the significant
computational overhead incurred when processing high-resolution, multi-view
images, a standard setup in AD systems with six or more synchronized cameras.
This overhead stems from the large number of visual tokens generated during
encoding, increasing inference latency and memory consumption due to the
quadratic complexity of self-attention. To address these challenges, we propose
Prune2Drive, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework for multi-view VLMs
in autonomous driving. Prune2Drive introduces two core innovations: (i) a
diversity-aware token selection mechanism inspired by farthest point sampling,
which prioritizes semantic and spatial coverage across views rather than
relying solely on attention scores, and (ii) a view-adaptive pruning controller
that learns optimal pruning ratios for each camera view based on their
importance to downstream driving tasks. Unlike prior methods, Prune2Drive does
not require model retraining or access to attention maps, making it compatible
with modern efficient attention implementations. Extensive experiments on two
large-scale multi-view driving benchmarks, DriveLM and DriveLMM-o1, show that
Prune2Drive achieves significant speedups and memory savings while maintaining
or improving task performance. When retaining only 10% of the visual tokens,
our method achieves a 6.40$\times$ speedup in the prefilling phase and consumes
13.4% of the original FLOPs, with only a 3% performance drop on the DriveLM
benchmark.

### [9] [DAASH: A Meta-Attack Framework for Synthesizing Effective and Stealthy Adversarial Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13309)
*Abdullah Al Nomaan Nafi,Habibur Rahaman,Zafaryab Haider,Tanzim Mahfuz,Fnu Suya,Swarup Bhunia,Prabuddha Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAASH是一个完全可微分的元攻击框架，通过策略性地组合现有的Lp范数攻击方法，生成有效且感知对齐的对抗样本。它在多个阶段聚合候选对抗样本，使用学习到的自适应权重，并通过联合最小化误分类损失和感知失真的元损失函数指导整个过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Lp范数约束对抗样本往往与人类感知不一致，且不清楚Lp约束攻击的见解是否能有效提升感知效果。需要开发能够生成感知对齐对抗样本的方法。

Method: 多阶段框架，每阶段聚合多个基础攻击的候选对抗样本，使用学习到的自适应权重传播到下一阶段。通过元损失函数联合优化误分类损失和感知失真。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet上显著优于最先进的感知攻击方法AdvAD，攻击成功率提高20.63%，SSIM、LPIPS和FID指标分别改善约11、0.015和5.7。

Conclusion: DAASH能够很好地泛化到未见过的防御方法，无需为每个新防御手工设计自适应攻击，是评估鲁棒性的实用且强大的基线方法。

Abstract: Numerous techniques have been proposed for generating adversarial examples in
white-box settings under strict Lp-norm constraints. However, such norm-bounded
examples often fail to align well with human perception, and only recently have
a few methods begun specifically exploring perceptually aligned adversarial
examples. Moreover, it remains unclear whether insights from Lp-constrained
attacks can be effectively leveraged to improve perceptual efficacy. In this
paper, we introduce DAASH, a fully differentiable meta-attack framework that
generates effective and perceptually aligned adversarial examples by
strategically composing existing Lp-based attack methods. DAASH operates in a
multi-stage fashion: at each stage, it aggregates candidate adversarial
examples from multiple base attacks using learned, adaptive weights and
propagates the result to the next stage. A novel meta-loss function guides this
process by jointly minimizing misclassification loss and perceptual distortion,
enabling the framework to dynamically modulate the contribution of each base
attack throughout the stages. We evaluate DAASH on adversarially trained models
across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. Despite relying solely on
Lp-constrained based methods, DAASH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
perceptual attacks such as AdvAD -- achieving higher attack success rates
(e.g., 20.63\% improvement) and superior visual quality, as measured by SSIM,
LPIPS, and FID (improvements $\approx$ of 11, 0.015, and 5.7, respectively).
Furthermore, DAASH generalizes well to unseen defenses, making it a practical
and strong baseline for evaluating robustness without requiring handcrafted
adaptive attacks for each new defense.

Abstract: The Id-Pattern system within the RED.AI project (Reabilita\c{c}\~ao
Estrutural Digital atrav\'es da AI) consists of an agentic system designed to
assist in the identification of stone deterioration patterns. Traditional
methodologies, based on direct observation by expert teams, are accurate but
costly in terms of time and resources. The system developed here introduces and
evaluates a multi-agent artificial intelligence (AI) system, designed to
simulate collaboration between experts and automate the diagnosis of stone
pathologies from visual evidence. The approach is based on a cognitive
architecture that orchestrates a team of specialized AI agents which, in this
specific case, are limited to five: a lithologist, a pathologist, an
environmental expert, a conservator-restorer, and a diagnostic coordinator. To
evaluate the system we selected 28 difficult images involving multiple
deterioration patterns. Our first results showed a huge boost on all metrics of
our system compared to the foundational model.

Abstract: We introduce a scalable, interpretable computer-vision framework for
quantifying aesthetic outcomes of facial plastic surgery using frontal
photographs. Our pipeline leverages automated landmark detection, geometric
facial symmetry computation, deep-learning-based age estimation, and nasal
morphology analysis. To perform this study, we first assemble the largest
curated dataset of paired pre- and post-operative facial images to date,
encompassing 7,160 photographs from 1,259 patients. This dataset includes a
dedicated rhinoplasty-only subset consisting of 732 images from 366 patients,
96.2% of whom showed improvement in at least one of the three nasal
measurements with statistically significant group-level change. Among these
patients, the greatest statistically significant improvements (p < 0.001)
occurred in the alar width to face width ratio (77.0%), nose length to face
height ratio (41.5%), and alar width to intercanthal ratio (39.3%). Among the
broader frontal-view cohort, comprising 989 rigorously filtered subjects, 71.3%
exhibited significant enhancements in global facial symmetry or perceived age
(p < 0.01). Importantly, our analysis shows that patient identity remains
consistent post-operatively, with True Match Rates of 99.5% and 99.6% at a
False Match Rate of 0.01% for the rhinoplasty-specific and general patient
cohorts, respectively. Additionally, we analyze inter-practitioner variability
in improvement rates. By providing reproducible, quantitative benchmarks and a
novel dataset, our pipeline facilitates data-driven surgical planning, patient
counseling, and objective outcome evaluation across practices.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural
language processing and multi-modal understanding. However, their high
computational cost, limited accessibility, and data privacy concerns hinder
their adoption in resource-constrained healthcare environments. This study
investigates the performance of small language models (SLMs) in a medical
imaging classification task, comparing different models and prompt designs to
identify the optimal combination for accuracy and usability. Using the NIH
Chest X-ray dataset, we evaluate multiple SLMs on the task of classifying chest
X-ray positions (anteroposterior [AP] vs. posteroanterior [PA]) under three
prompt strategies: baseline instruction, incremental summary prompts, and
correction-based reflective prompts. Our results show that certain SLMs achieve
competitive accuracy with well-crafted prompts, suggesting that prompt
engineering can substantially enhance SLM performance in healthcare
applications without requiring deep AI expertise from end users.

competition designed to advance techniques for automatic rip current
segmentation in still images. Rip currents are dangerous, fast-moving flows
that pose a major risk to beach safety worldwide, making accurate visual
detection an important and underexplored research task. The challenge builds on
RipVIS, the largest available rip current dataset, and focuses on single-class
instance segmentation, where precise delineation is critical to fully capture
the extent of rip currents. The dataset spans diverse locations, rip current
types, and camera orientations, providing a realistic and challenging
benchmark.

$5$ valid test submissions. Teams were evaluated on a composite score combining
$F_1$, $F_2$, $AP_{50}$, and $AP_{[50:95]}$, ensuring robust and
application-relevant rankings. The top-performing methods leveraged deep
learning architectures, domain adaptation techniques, pretrained models, and
domain generalization strategies to improve performance under diverse
conditions.
  This report outlines the dataset details, competition framework, evaluation
metrics, and final results, providing insights into the current state of rip
current segmentation. We conclude with a discussion of key challenges, lessons
learned from the submissions, and future directions for expanding RipSeg.

### [14] [Mitigating Easy Option Bias in Multiple-Choice Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13428)
*Hao Zhang,Chen Li,Basura Fernando*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现多选VQA基准中存在Easy-Options Bias问题，VLMs仅凭视觉和选项就能猜出正确答案，无需问题。提出了GroundAttack工具生成困难负选项，创建了无偏数据集来更真实评估VLM能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA基准存在选项偏差问题，导致模型可以通过简单的视觉-选项相似度匹配来猜测答案，无法真实评估模型的问答能力。

Method: 通过接地实验分析偏差来源，开发GroundAttack工具自动生成视觉上合理的困难负选项，创建无偏数据集。

Result: 在无偏数据集上，当前VLMs在仅视觉+选项设置下准确率接近随机，在完整设置下准确率也显著下降，提供了更真实的评估。

Conclusion: 揭示了VQA基准中的选项偏差问题，提出的解决方案能更准确地评估VLMs的真实问答能力。

Abstract: In this early study, we observe an Easy-Options Bias (EOB) issue in some
multiple-choice Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks such as MMStar,
RealWorldQA, SEED-Bench, Next-QA, STAR benchmark and Video-MME. This bias
allows vision-language models (VLMs) to select the correct answer using only
the vision (V) and options (O) as inputs, without the need for the question
(Q). Through grounding experiments, we attribute the bias to an imbalance in
visual relevance: the correct answer typically aligns more closely with the
visual contents than the negative options in feature space, creating a shortcut
for VLMs to infer the answer via simply vision-option similarity matching. To
fix this, we introduce GroundAttack, a toolkit that automatically generates
hard negative options as visually plausible as the correct answer. We apply it
to the NExT-QA and MMStar datasets, creating new EOB-free annotations. On these
EOB-free annotations, current VLMs approach to random accuracies under (V+O)
settings, and drop to non-saturated accuracies under (V+Q+O) settings,
providing a more realistic evaluation of VLMs' QA ability. Codes and new
annotations will be released soon.

Motivation: 传统方法在复杂动态的真实交通环境中存在可扩展性和泛化性问题，需要开发能够理解高速公路场景并进行稳健交通风险推断的智能系统。

Method: 使用GPT-4o和o3-mini两个大视觉语言模型，采用结构化思维链策略生成多视角输出作为伪标注，通过知识蒸馏训练小型学生模型VISTA。

Conclusion: 有效的知识蒸馏和结构化多智能体监督可以使轻量级视觉语言模型具备复杂推理能力，紧凑架构便于边缘设备部署，实现实时风险监控。

Abstract: Comprehensive highway scene understanding and robust traffic risk inference
are vital for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and autonomous
driving. Traditional approaches often struggle with scalability and
generalization, particularly under the complex and dynamic conditions of
real-world environments. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
structured prompting and knowledge distillation framework that enables
automatic generation of high-quality traffic scene annotations and contextual
risk assessments. Our framework orchestrates two large Vision-Language Models
(VLMs): GPT-4o and o3-mini, using a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy
to produce rich, multi-perspective outputs. These outputs serve as
knowledge-enriched pseudo-annotations for supervised fine-tuning of a much
smaller student VLM. The resulting compact 3B-scale model, named VISTA (Vision
for Intelligent Scene and Traffic Analysis), is capable of understanding
low-resolution traffic videos and generating semantically faithful, risk-aware
captions. Despite its significantly reduced parameter count, VISTA achieves
strong performance across established captioning metrics (BLEU-4, METEOR,
ROUGE-L, and CIDEr) when benchmarked against its teacher models. This
demonstrates that effective knowledge distillation and structured multi-agent
supervision can empower lightweight VLMs to capture complex reasoning
capabilities. The compact architecture of VISTA facilitates efficient
deployment on edge devices, enabling real-time risk monitoring without
requiring extensive infrastructure upgrades.

Motivation: 现有方法往往忽视面部特征的解耦空间，无法实现独立操作且不能与不同模态输入共享。需要探索面部特征的解耦空间，确保它们能够独立运作且能被不同模态输入共享。

Method: 使用四个轻量级模块将面部动态分解为嘴型、姿态、眼部和表情四个独立的潜在空间，每个空间由一组可学习基向量定义。通过正交性约束确保独立性，并设计高效训练策略分配运动责任。学习到的基向量存储在对应库中，实现与音频输入的共享视觉先验。

Conclusion: EDTalk++提供了一个完整的解耦框架，成功解决了面部特征独立控制和多模态输入共享的问题，在可控说话头生成方面表现出色。

Abstract: Achieving disentangled control over multiple facial motions and accommodating
diverse input modalities greatly enhances the application and entertainment of
the talking head generation. This necessitates a deep exploration of the
decoupling space for facial features, ensuring that they a) operate
independently without mutual interference and b) can be preserved to share with
different modal inputs, both aspects often neglected in existing methods. To
address this gap, this paper proposes EDTalk++, a novel full disentanglement
framework for controllable talking head generation. Our framework enables
individual manipulation of mouth shape, head pose, eye movement, and emotional
expression, conditioned on video or audio inputs. Specifically, we employ four
lightweight modules to decompose the facial dynamics into four distinct latent
spaces representing mouth, pose, eye, and expression, respectively. Each space
is characterized by a set of learnable bases whose linear combinations define
specific motions. To ensure independence and accelerate training, we enforce
orthogonality among bases and devise an efficient training strategy to allocate
motion responsibilities to each space without relying on external knowledge.
The learned bases are then stored in corresponding banks, enabling shared
visual priors with audio input. Furthermore, considering the properties of each
space, we propose an Audio-to-Motion module for audio-driven talking head
synthesis. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of
EDTalk++.

Motivation: 肾结石分类对个性化治疗和复发预防至关重要，传统CNN模型在捕捉长距离依赖关系方面存在局限，影响在多变成像条件下的性能

Method: 使用在ImageNet-21k上预训练的ViT-base模型与ResNet50基线模型进行比较分析，在两个离体数据集（CCD相机和软性输尿管镜图像）上进行评估

Result: ViT模型在所有成像条件下都优于ResNet50，在最复杂的子集（内窥镜图像切片）上达到95.2%准确率和95.1% F1分数，而ResNet50仅为64.5%和59.3%；在混合视图子集上ViT达到87.1%准确率，CNN为78.4%

Conclusion: ViT架构在肾结石图像分析中提供更优越的分类性能，是可扩展的传统CNN替代方案

Abstract: Kidney stone classification from endoscopic images is critical for
personalized treatment and recurrence prevention. While convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) have shown promise in this task, their limited ability to
capture long-range dependencies can hinder performance under variable imaging
conditions. This study presents a comparative analysis between Vision
Transformers (ViTs) and CNN-based models, evaluating their performance on two
ex vivo datasets comprising CCD camera and flexible ureteroscope images. The
ViT-base model pretrained on ImageNet-21k consistently outperformed a ResNet50
baseline across multiple imaging conditions. For instance, in the most visually
complex subset (Section patches from endoscopic images), the ViT model achieved
95.2% accuracy and 95.1% F1-score, compared to 64.5% and 59.3% with ResNet50.
In the mixed-view subset from CCD-camera images, ViT reached 87.1% accuracy
versus 78.4% with CNN. These improvements extend across precision and recall as
well. The results demonstrate that ViT-based architectures provide superior
classification performance and offer a scalable alternative to conventional
CNNs for kidney stone image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MINR通过共享中间层来高效编码多图像，在保持性能的同时减少60%参数，可扩展到处理100张图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的隐式神经表示(INR)为每张图像使用单独的神经网络，导致编码多图像时计算和存储效率低下。

Method: 分析训练好的INR层间权重分布，发现中间层分布模式高度相似，因此共享中间层而保留输入输出层为图像特定，并为每张图像设计额外的投影层来捕获独特特征。

Result: 在图像重建和超分辨率任务中，MINR节省60%参数的同时保持可比性能，可处理100张图像且平均PSNR达34dB。

Conclusion: MINR通过层共享策略有效解决了多图像INR编码的效率问题，具有很好的扩展性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) aim to parameterize discrete signals
through implicit continuous functions. However, formulating each image with a
separate neural network~(typically, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)) leads to
computational and storage inefficiencies when encoding multi-images. To address
this issue, we propose MINR, sharing specific layers to encode multi-image
efficiently. We first compare the layer-wise weight distributions for several
trained INRs and find that corresponding intermediate layers follow highly
similar distribution patterns. Motivated by this, we share these intermediate
layers across multiple images while preserving the input and output layers as
input-specific. In addition, we design an extra novel projection layer for each
image to capture its unique features. Experimental results on image
reconstruction and super-resolution tasks demonstrate that MINR can save up to
60\% parameters while maintaining comparable performance. Particularly, MINR
scales effectively to handle 100 images, maintaining an average peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 34 dB. Further analysis of various backbones
proves the robustness of the proposed MINR.

TL;DR: DHQ是一种针对隐式神经表示(INRs)的分布感知哈达玛量化方案，通过哈达玛变换将权重和激活值的不同分布统一为标准钟形分布，实现高效量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: INRs依赖全精度计算导致硬件开销大，现有量化方法仅关注权重量化，激活值量化缺失限制了硬件效益。需要同时量化权重和激活值以充分发挥量化优势。

Method: 提出DHQ方案：1) 分析发现首尾层权重和激活值分布特殊；2) 使用哈达玛变换将不同分布统一为标准钟形；3) 应用标准量化器；4) 在FPGA上实现硬件高效设计。

Result: 在图像重建任务中，DHQ相比全精度版本：延迟降低32.7%，能耗降低40.1%，资源利用率最高减少98.3%，性能优于先前量化方法。

Conclusion: DHQ通过分布感知的哈达玛变换有效解决了INRs中权重和激活值的量化问题，显著提升了硬件效率，为INRs的硬件部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals using
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with complex activation functions. While INRs
achieve superior performance, they depend on full-precision number
representation for accurate computation, resulting in significant hardware
overhead. Previous INR quantization approaches have primarily focused on weight
quantization, offering only limited hardware savings due to the lack of
activation quantization. To fully exploit the hardware benefits of
quantization, we propose DHQ, a novel distribution-aware Hadamard quantization
scheme that targets both weights and activations in INRs. Our analysis shows
that the weights in the first and last layers have distributions distinct from
those in the intermediate layers, while the activations in the last layer
differ significantly from those in the preceding layers. Instead of customizing
quantizers individually, we utilize the Hadamard transformation to standardize
these diverse distributions into a unified bell-shaped form, supported by both
empirical evidence and theoretical analysis, before applying a standard
quantizer. To demonstrate the practical advantages of our approach, we present
an FPGA implementation of DHQ that highlights its hardware efficiency.
Experiments on diverse image reconstruction tasks show that DHQ outperforms
previous quantization methods, reducing latency by 32.7\%, energy consumption
by 40.1\%, and resource utilization by up to 98.3\% compared to full-precision
counterparts.

Conclusion: 提出的鲁棒损失函数有效增强了INRs对权重扰动的抵抗力，为INRs在实际应用中的稳定部署提供了重要保障。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals in a
continuous manner using neural networks, demonstrating significant value across
various multimedia applications. However, the vulnerability of INRs presents a
critical challenge for their real-world deployments, as the network weights
might be subjected to unavoidable perturbations. In this work, we investigate
the robustness of INRs for the first time and find that even minor
perturbations can lead to substantial performance degradation in the quality of
signal reconstruction. To mitigate this issue, we formulate the robustness
problem in INRs by minimizing the difference between loss with and without
weight perturbations. Furthermore, we derive a novel robust loss function to
regulate the gradient of the reconstruction loss with respect to weights,
thereby enhancing the robustness. Extensive experiments on reconstruction tasks
across multiple modalities demonstrate that our method achieves up to a 7.5~dB
improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) values compared to original
INRs under noisy conditions.

Conclusion: FAMNet通过多任务学习和分层注意力机制有效提升了微表情识别性能，证明了融合2D和3D CNN方法的有效性

Abstract: Micro-expressions recognition (MER) has essential application value in many
fields, but the short duration and low intensity of micro-expressions (MEs)
bring considerable challenges to MER. The current MER methods in deep learning
mainly include three data loading methods: static images, dynamic image
sequence, and a combination of the two streams. How to effectively extract MEs'
fine-grained and spatiotemporal features has been difficult to solve. This
paper proposes a new MER method based on multi-task learning and hierarchical
attention, which fully extracts MEs' omni-directional features by merging 2D
and 3D CNNs. The fusion model consists of a 2D CNN AMNet2D and a 3D CNN
AMNet3D, with similar structures consisting of a shared backbone network
Resnet18 and attention modules. During training, the model adopts different
data loading methods to adapt to two specific networks respectively, jointly
trains on the tasks of MER and facial action unit detection (FAUD), and adopts
the parameter hard sharing for information association, which further improves
the effect of the MER task, and the final fused model is called FAMNet.
Extensive experimental results show that our proposed FAMNet significantly
improves task performance. On the SAMM, CASME II and MMEW datasets, FAMNet
achieves 83.75% (UAR) and 84.03% (UF1). Furthermore, on the challenging
CAS(ME)$^3$ dataset, FAMNet achieves 51% (UAR) and 43.42% (UF1).

Abstract: 4D radar-based object detection has garnered great attention for its
robustness in adverse weather conditions and capacity to deliver rich spatial
information across diverse driving scenarios. Nevertheless, the sparse and
noisy nature of 4D radar point clouds poses substantial challenges for
effective perception. To address the limitation, we present CORENet, a novel
cross-modal denoising framework that leverages LiDAR supervision to identify
noise patterns and extract discriminative features from raw 4D radar data.
Designed as a plug-and-play architecture, our solution enables seamless
integration into voxel-based detection frameworks without modifying existing
pipelines. Notably, the proposed method only utilizes LiDAR data for
cross-modal supervision during training while maintaining full radar-only
operation during inference. Extensive evaluation on the challenging Dual-Radar
dataset, which is characterized by elevated noise level, demonstrates the
effectiveness of our framework in enhancing detection robustness. Comprehensive
experiments validate that CORENet achieves superior performance compared to
existing mainstream approaches.

*Shihao Dong,Yuhui Zheng,Huiying Xu,Xinzhong Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出BDCL框架，通过双级解耦和一致性学习提升多视图聚类的特征表示质量，增强簇间区分性和簇内紧凑性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视图聚类中，虽然学习视图间一致性和互补性可以提升性能，但面向聚类的表示学习往往被忽视，需要探索更有效的特征表示来增强簇间区分性和簇内紧凑性

Method: 三模块框架：1)多视图实例学习模块通过重构自编码器和对比学习对齐一致信息并保留私有特征；2)双级特征和簇解耦增强特征空间和簇空间的区分性；3)一致性学习模块将样本的不同视图及其邻居视为正对，学习聚类分配一致性并压缩簇内空间

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法相比SOTA方法具有优越性

Conclusion: BDCL框架通过双级解耦和一致性学习有效提升了多视图聚类的性能，增强了特征表示的簇间区分性和簇内紧凑性

Abstract: Multi-view clustering has shown to be an effective method for analyzing
underlying patterns in multi-view data. The performance of clustering can be
improved by learning the consistency and complementarity between multi-view
features, however, cluster-oriented representation learning is often
overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel Bi-level Decoupling and
Consistency Learning framework (BDCL) to further explore the effective
representation for multi-view data to enhance inter-cluster discriminability
and intra-cluster compactness of features in multi-view clustering. Our
framework comprises three modules: 1) The multi-view instance learning module
aligns the consistent information while preserving the private features between
views through reconstruction autoencoder and contrastive learning. 2) The
bi-level decoupling of features and clusters enhances the discriminability of
feature space and cluster space. 3) The consistency learning module treats the
different views of the sample and their neighbors as positive pairs, learns the
consistency of their clustering assignments, and further compresses the
intra-cluster space. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with the SOTA
methods. Our code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/BDCL.

*Tianyi Xu,Fan Zhang,Boxin Shi,Tianfan Xue,Yujin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于强化学习的AdaptiveAE方法，通过优化快门速度和ISO组合选择，在动态场景中最大化HDR重建质量，解决了现有方法忽略快门速度与ISO复杂交互以及运动模糊的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流HDR成像技术依赖多曝光图像融合，但现有方法往往忽略快门速度与ISO的复杂交互关系，未能考虑动态场景中的运动模糊效应，导致高ISO引入噪声、长快门速度产生运动模糊的问题。

Method: 提出AdaptiveAE强化学习方法，集成包含运动模糊和噪声模拟的图像合成流程，利用语义信息和曝光直方图，基于用户定义的曝光时间预算自适应选择最优ISO和快门速度序列。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法达到了最先进的性能水平，能够找到比传统解决方案更好的曝光调度方案。

Conclusion: AdaptiveAE通过强化学习优化曝光参数选择，有效解决了动态场景HDR成像中的噪声和运动模糊平衡问题，显著提升了HDR重建质量。

Abstract: Mainstream high dynamic range imaging techniques typically rely on fusing
multiple images captured with different exposure setups (shutter speed and
ISO). A good balance between shutter speed and ISO is crucial for achieving
high-quality HDR, as high ISO values introduce significant noise, while long
shutter speeds can lead to noticeable motion blur. However, existing methods
often overlook the complex interaction between shutter speed and ISO and fail
to account for motion blur effects in dynamic scenes.
  In this work, we propose AdaptiveAE, a reinforcement learning-based method
that optimizes the selection of shutter speed and ISO combinations to maximize
HDR reconstruction quality in dynamic environments. AdaptiveAE integrates an
image synthesis pipeline that incorporates motion blur and noise simulation
into our training procedure, leveraging semantic information and exposure
histograms. It can adaptively select optimal ISO and shutter speed sequences
based on a user-defined exposure time budget, and find a better exposure
schedule than traditional solutions. Experimental results across multiple
datasets demonstrate that it achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 现有6D姿态估计数据集主要针对机器人臂操作的小型家居物体，无法满足移动机器人在工业环境中面对大型物体、远距离感知、严重自遮挡和多样化视角的需求。

Method: 构建包含92个真实场景、16个独特物体的MR6D数据集，涵盖静态和动态交互场景，特别捕捉移动平台特有的远距离视角、多样化物体配置、大型物体尺寸和复杂遮挡模式。

Result: 初步实验显示当前6D姿态估计方法在这些场景下表现不佳，2D分割成为另一个主要障碍，验证了该数据集的挑战性。

Conclusion: MR6D为开发和评估面向移动机器人需求的姿态估计方法奠定了基础，填补了该领域的数据空白，数据集已公开提供。

Abstract: Existing 6D pose estimation datasets primarily focus on small household
objects typically handled by robot arm manipulators, limiting their relevance
to mobile robotics. Mobile platforms often operate without manipulators,
interact with larger objects, and face challenges such as long-range
perception, heavy self-occlusion, and diverse camera perspectives. While recent
models generalize well to unseen objects, evaluations remain confined to
household-like settings that overlook these factors. We introduce MR6D, a
dataset designed for 6D pose estimation for mobile robots in industrial
environments. It includes 92 real-world scenes featuring 16 unique objects
across static and dynamic interactions. MR6D captures the challenges specific
to mobile platforms, including distant viewpoints, varied object
configurations, larger object sizes, and complex occlusion/self-occlusion
patterns. Initial experiments reveal that current 6D pipelines underperform in
these settings, with 2D segmentation being another hurdle. MR6D establishes a
foundation for developing and evaluating pose estimation methods tailored to
the demands of mobile robotics. The dataset is available at

Conclusion: 这项工作为理解这种主要但研究不足的快节奏球拍运动形式建立了基础，证明了从单打到双打模型迁移的可行性，为双打羽毛球分析提供了新的技术途径。

Abstract: Badminton is known as one of the fastest racket sports in the world. Despite
doubles matches being more prevalent in international tournaments than singles,
previous research has mainly focused on singles due to the challenges in data
availability and multi-person tracking. To address this gap, we designed an
approach that transfers singles-trained models to doubles analysis. We
extracted keypoints from the ShuttleSet single matches dataset using ViT-Pose
and embedded them through a contrastive learning framework based on ST-GCN. To
improve tracking stability, we incorporated a custom multi-object tracking
algorithm that resolves ID switching issues from fast and overlapping player
movements. A Transformer-based classifier then determines shot occurrences
based on the learned embeddings. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of
extending pose-based shot recognition to doubles badminton, broadening
analytics capabilities. This work establishes a foundation for doubles-specific
datasets to enhance understanding of this predominant yet understudied format
of the fast racket sport.

*Yiang Shi,Xiaoyang Guo,Wei Yin,Mingkai Jia,Qian Zhang,Xiaolin Hu,Wenyu Liu,Xinggang Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VGQ是一种新的图像tokenizer范式，通过将2D高斯分布整合到传统视觉码本量化框架中，显式增强结构建模能力，解决了现有VQ-GAN等方法在几何结构建模方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于量化的tokenizer（如VQ-GAN）主要关注纹理和颜色等外观特征，由于其基于patch的设计往往忽略了几何结构信息。需要开发能够更好编码结构化视觉信息的tokenizer。

Method: 提出Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ)框架，将图像潜在表示编码为2D高斯分布，通过直接建模位置、旋转和尺度等结构相关参数来有效捕捉几何和空间结构。增加token中2D高斯的密度可以提高重建保真度。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256基准测试中，VGQ实现了rFID分数1.00的强重建质量。通过增加2D高斯密度，进一步达到rFID 0.556和PSNR 24.93的SOTA重建性能，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VGQ通过整合2D高斯分布提供了一种新的tokenizer范式，在保持token效率的同时显著提升了视觉丰富度和结构建模能力，为AR图像生成提供了更好的视觉编码解决方案。

Abstract: The image tokenizer is a critical component in AR image generation, as it
determines how rich and structured visual content is encoded into compact
representations. Existing quantization-based tokenizers such as VQ-GAN
primarily focus on appearance features like texture and color, often neglecting
geometric structures due to their patch-based design. In this work, we explored
how to incorporate more visual information into the tokenizer and proposed a
new framework named Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ), a novel tokenizer
paradigm that explicitly enhances structural modeling by integrating 2D
Gaussians into traditional visual codebook quantization frameworks. Our
approach addresses the inherent limitations of naive quantization methods such
as VQ-GAN, which struggle to model structured visual information due to their
patch-based design and emphasis on texture and color. In contrast, VGQ encodes
image latents as 2D Gaussian distributions, effectively capturing geometric and
spatial structures by directly modeling structure-related parameters such as
position, rotation and scale. We further demonstrate that increasing the
density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens leads to significant gains in
reconstruction fidelity, providing a flexible trade-off between token
efficiency and visual richness. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, VGQ achieves
strong reconstruction quality with an rFID score of 1.00. Furthermore, by
increasing the density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens, VGQ gains a
significant boost in reconstruction capability and achieves a state-of-the-art
reconstruction rFID score of 0.556 and a PSNR of 24.93, substantially
outperforming existing methods. Codes will be released soon.

Method: 利用现成的基础模型（如CLIP、DINOv2）提取特征，分析特征分布的几何形状，并设计几何知识引导的分布校准框架

Result: 在联邦学习和长尾识别等挑战性场景中，该方法有效克服了数据异质性和样本不平衡造成的信息缺失，在多个基准测试中提升了性能

Conclusion: 基础模型提取的特征分布几何形状具有跨域迁移性，几何知识引导的分布校准是解决数据分布差距的有效方法

Abstract: Despite the fast progress of deep learning, one standing challenge is the gap
of the observed training samples and the underlying true distribution. There
are multiple reasons for the causing of this gap e.g. sampling bias, noise etc.
In the era of foundation models, we show that when leveraging the off-the-shelf
(vision) foundation models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2) for feature extraction, the
geometric shapes of the resulting feature distributions exhibit remarkable
transferability across domains and datasets. To verify its practical
usefulness, we embody our geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
framework in two popular and challenging settings: federated learning and
long-tailed recognition. In the federated setting, we devise a technique of
acquiring the global geometric shape under privacy constraints, then leverage
this knowledge to generate new samples for clients, in the aim of bridging the
gap between local and global observations. In long-tailed learning, it utilizes
the geometric knowledge transferred from sample-rich categories to recover the
true distribution for sample-scarce tail classes. Comprehensive experiments
show that our proposed geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
effectively overcomes information deficits caused by data heterogeneity and
sample imbalance, with boosted performance across benchmarks.

Abstract: Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is crucial for applications such as
human-computer interaction and mental health diagnostics. This study presents
the first empirical comparison of open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
including Phi-3.5 Vision and CLIP, against traditional deep learning models
VGG19, ResNet-50, and EfficientNet-B0 on the challenging FER-2013 dataset,
which contains 35,887 low-resolution grayscale images across seven emotion
classes. To address the mismatch between VLM training assumptions and the noisy
nature of FER data, we introduce a novel pipeline that integrates GFPGAN-based
image restoration with FER evaluation. Results show that traditional models,
particularly EfficientNet-B0 (86.44%) and ResNet-50 (85.72%), significantly
outperform VLMs like CLIP (64.07%) and Phi-3.5 Vision (51.66%), highlighting
the limitations of VLMs in low-quality visual tasks. In addition to performance
evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, we provide a
detailed computational cost analysis covering preprocessing, training,
inference, and evaluation phases, offering practical insights for deployment.
This work underscores the need for adapting VLMs to noisy environments and
provides a reproducible benchmark for future research in emotion recognition.

TL;DR: 提出了EAvatar框架，基于3D高斯泼溅技术，通过稀疏表情控制机制和3D先验知识，实现了更高精度和视觉一致性的头部重建，解决了现有方法在细粒度表情捕捉和局部纹理连续性方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3DGS方法在捕捉细粒度面部表情和保持局部纹理连续性方面存在显著挑战，特别是在高度可变形的区域。需要一种既能感知表情又能感知形变的高保真头部重建方法。

Method: 提出EAvatar框架，引入稀疏表情控制机制（少量关键高斯影响邻近高斯形变），并利用预训练生成模型的高质量3D先验知识提供可靠的面部几何结构指导。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能够产生更准确和视觉一致的头部重建结果，具有改进的表情可控性和细节保真度。

Conclusion: EAvatar框架通过结合稀疏表情控制和3D先验知识，成功解决了3DGS在头部重建中的局限性，为AR/VR、游戏和多媒体内容创作提供了更高质量的头部avatar重建方案。

Abstract: High-fidelity head avatar reconstruction plays a crucial role in AR/VR,
gaming, and multimedia content creation. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated effectiveness in modeling complex geometry
with real-time rendering capability and are now widely used in high-fidelity
head avatar reconstruction tasks. However, existing 3DGS-based methods still
face significant challenges in capturing fine-grained facial expressions and
preserving local texture continuity, especially in highly deformable regions.
To mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel 3DGS-based framework termed
EAvatar for head reconstruction that is both expression-aware and
deformation-aware. Our method introduces a sparse expression control mechanism,
where a small number of key Gaussians are used to influence the deformation of
their neighboring Gaussians, enabling accurate modeling of local deformations
and fine-scale texture transitions. Furthermore, we leverage high-quality 3D
priors from pretrained generative models to provide a more reliable facial
geometry, offering structural guidance that improves convergence stability and
shape accuracy during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method produces more accurate and visually coherent head reconstructions with
improved expression controllability and detail fidelity.

TL;DR: FLAIR提出了一种频率和局部性感知的隐式神经表示方法，通过RC-GAUSS激活函数和WEGE编码机制解决现有INRs缺乏频率选择性和空间局部性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐式神经表示(INRs)缺乏频率选择性、空间局部性和稀疏表示，导致过度依赖冗余信号分量，表现出频谱偏差，难以捕捉高频细节。

Method: 提出FLAIR方法：1) RC-GAUSS激活函数，在时频不确定性原理约束下实现显式频率选择和空间定位；2) WEGE编码，利用离散小波变换计算能量分数并显式引导频率信息到网络。

Result: 在2D图像表示和恢复以及3D重建任务中，该方法持续优于现有INRs。

Conclusion: FLAIR通过频率感知机制有效解决了INRs的频谱偏差问题，在多个视觉任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) leverage neural networks to map
coordinates to corresponding signals, enabling continuous and compact
representations. This paradigm has driven significant advances in various
vision tasks. However, existing INRs lack frequency selectivity, spatial
localization, and sparse representations, leading to an over-reliance on
redundant signal components. Consequently, they exhibit spectral bias, tending
to learn low-frequency components early while struggling to capture fine
high-frequency details. To address these issues, we propose FLAIR (Frequency-
and Locality-Aware Implicit Neural Representations), which incorporates two key
innovations. The first is RC-GAUSS, a novel activation designed for explicit
frequency selection and spatial localization under the constraints of the
time-frequency uncertainty principle (TFUP). The second is
Wavelet-Energy-Guided Encoding (WEGE), which leverages the discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to compute energy scores and explicitly guide frequency
information to the network. Our method consistently outperforms existing INRs
in 2D image representation and restoration, as well as 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: Foveated rendering significantly reduces computational demands in virtual
reality applications by concentrating rendering quality where users focus their
gaze. Current approaches require expensive hardware-based eye tracking systems,
limiting widespread adoption due to cost, calibration complexity, and hardware
compatibility constraints. This paper presents GazeProphet, a software-only
approach for predicting gaze locations in VR environments without requiring
dedicated eye tracking hardware. The approach combines a Spherical Vision
Transformer for processing 360-degree VR scenes with an LSTM-based temporal
encoder that captures gaze sequence patterns. A multi-modal fusion network
integrates spatial scene features with temporal gaze dynamics to predict future
gaze locations with associated confidence estimates. Experimental evaluation on
a comprehensive VR dataset demonstrates that GazeProphet achieves a median
angular error of 3.83 degrees, outperforming traditional saliency-based
baselines by 24% while providing reliable confidence calibration. The approach
maintains consistent performance across different spatial regions and scene
types, enabling practical deployment in VR systems without additional hardware
requirements. Statistical analysis confirms the significance of improvements
across all evaluation metrics. These results show that software-only gaze
prediction can work for VR foveated rendering, making this performance boost
more accessible to different VR platforms and apps.

Conclusion: 该方法能够实现高效的GFVC部署，特别适用于资源受限环境

Abstract: Generative Face Video Coding (GFVC) achieves superior rate-distortion
performance by leveraging the strong inference capabilities of deep generative
models. However, its practical deployment is hindered by large model parameters
and high computational costs. To address this, we propose a lightweight GFVC
framework that introduces dual-mode optimization -- combining architectural
redesign and operational refinement -- to reduce complexity whilst preserving
reconstruction quality. Architecturally, we replace traditional 3 x 3
convolutions with slimmer and more efficient layers, reducing complexity
without compromising feature expressiveness. Operationally, we develop a
two-stage adaptive channel pruning strategy: (1) soft pruning during training
identifies redundant channels via learnable thresholds, and (2) hard pruning
permanently eliminates these channels post-training using a derived mask. This
dual-phase approach ensures both training stability and inference efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed lightweight dual-mode
optimization for GFVC can achieve 90.4% parameter reduction and 88.9%
computation saving compared to the baseline, whilst achieving superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art video coding standard Versatile Video
Coding (VVC) in terms of perceptual-level quality metrics. As such, the
proposed method is expected to enable efficient GFVC deployment in
resource-constrained environments such as mobile edge devices.

Conclusion: 这种生物启发的方法具有很强的发展潜力，可能有助于克服神经形态计算的当前限制，促进SNN的更广泛应用

Abstract: In recent years, neuromorphic computing and spiking neural networks (SNNs)
have ad-vanced rapidly through integration with deep learning. However, the
performance of SNNs still lags behind that of convolutional neural networks
(CNNs), primarily due to the limited information capacity of spike-based data.
Although some studies have attempted to improve SNN performance by training
them with non-spiking inputs such as static images, this approach deviates from
the original intent of neuromorphic computing, which emphasizes spike-based
information processing. To address this issue, we propose a Neuron-like
Encoding method that generates spike data based on the intrinsic operational
principles and functions of biological neurons. This method is further enhanced
by the incorporation of an artificial pho-toreceptor layer, enabling spike data
to carry both color and luminance information, thereby forming a complete
visual spike signal. Experimental results using the Integrate-and-Fire neuron
model demonstrate that this biologically inspired approach effectively
increases the information content of spike signals and improves SNN

TL;DR: DictAS是一个新颖的少样本异常分割框架，通过自监督字典查找机制实现跨类别的异常检测，无需目标数据重新训练，仅使用少量正常参考图像作为视觉提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视觉语言模型在少样本异常分割中过度依赖已知类别异常样本先验知识的问题，实现真正的跨类别泛化能力。

Method: 包含三个核心组件：字典构建（用正常参考图像特征模拟字典）、字典查找（通过稀疏查找策略检索查询特征，无法检索的为异常）、查询判别正则化（通过对比查询约束和文本对齐约束增强异常判别能力）。

Result: 在7个工业和医学数据集上的广泛实验表明，DictAS持续优于最先进的少样本异常分割方法。

Conclusion: DictAS通过自监督字典查找机制成功实现了无需重新训练的跨类别异常检测，为少样本异常分割提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have demonstrated remarkable
class-generalizable ability to unseen classes in few-shot anomaly segmentation
(FSAS), leveraging supervised prompt learning or fine-tuning on seen classes.
However, their cross-category generalization largely depends on prior knowledge
of real seen anomaly samples. In this paper, we propose a novel framework,
namely DictAS, which enables a unified model to detect visual anomalies in
unseen object categories without any retraining on the target data, only
employing a few normal reference images as visual prompts. The insight behind
DictAS is to transfer dictionary lookup capabilities to the FSAS task for
unseen classes via self-supervised learning, instead of merely memorizing the
normal and abnormal feature patterns from the training set. Specifically,
DictAS mainly consists of three components: (1) **Dictionary Construction** -
to simulate the index and content of a real dictionary using features from
normal reference images. (2) **Dictionary Lookup** - to retrieve queried region
features from the dictionary via a sparse lookup strategy. When a query feature
cannot be retrieved, it is classified as an anomaly. (3) **Query Discrimination
Regularization**- to enhance anomaly discrimination by making abnormal features
harder to retrieve from the dictionary. To achieve this, Contrastive Query
Constraint and Text Alignment Constraint are further proposed. Extensive
experiments on seven public industrial and medical datasets demonstrate that
DictAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSAS methods.

TL;DR: Learnable SMPLify是一个神经框架，用单次回归模型替代SMPLify中的迭代优化过程，实现近200倍的速度提升，同时保持精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SMPLify虽然是一个稳健的3D人体姿态和形状估计基线，但其迭代优化过程计算成本高，限制了实用性。受其他领域用神经网络替代迭代优化的启发，希望开发更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出可学习SMPLify框架，采用时序采样策略构建初始化-目标对用于训练，使用人体中心归一化方案和残差学习来缩小解空间，支持序列推理和插件式后处理。

Result: 方法实现了近200倍的速度提升，在未见过的3DPW和RICH数据集上泛化良好，作为插件工具在LucidAction上以模型无关方式运行。

Conclusion: Learnable SMPLify建立了一个实用且简单的基线，显著提高了3D人体姿态和形状估计的效率，同时保持了良好的精度和泛化能力。

Abstract: In 3D human pose and shape estimation, SMPLify remains a robust baseline that
solves inverse kinematics (IK) through iterative optimization. However, its
high computational cost limits its practicality. Recent advances across domains
have shown that replacing iterative optimization with data-driven neural
networks can achieve significant runtime improvements without sacrificing
accuracy. Motivated by this trend, we propose Learnable SMPLify, a neural
framework that replaces the iterative fitting process in SMPLify with a
single-pass regression model. The design of our framework targets two core
challenges in neural IK: data construction and generalization. To enable
effective training, we propose a temporal sampling strategy that constructs
initialization-target pairs from sequential frames. To improve generalization
across diverse motions and unseen poses, we propose a human-centric
normalization scheme and residual learning to narrow the solution space.
Learnable SMPLify supports both sequential inference and plug-in
post-processing to refine existing image-based estimators. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method establishes itself as a practical and
simple baseline: it achieves nearly 200x faster runtime compared to SMPLify,
generalizes well to unseen 3DPW and RICH, and operates in a model-agnostic
manner when used as a plug-in tool on LucidAction. The code is available at
https://github.com/Charrrrrlie/Learnable-SMPLify.

Motivation: 现有视频动作分析方法在特征提取中忽视了特征语义，主要关注动作建议优化，导致精度有限，不适合高性能物联网应用如自动驾驶。

Method: 基于生成注意力的模型，同时学习时间动作特征语义的帧级和段级依赖关系，利用动作前景和背景差异来捕捉特征语义。

Conclusion: 所提出的生成注意力模型能够有效学习特征语义关系，在视频动作分析任务中表现出优越性能，适合高性能物联网应用场景。

Abstract: Video action analysis is a foundational technology within the realm of
intelligent video comprehension, particularly concerning its application in
Internet of Things(IoT). However, existing methodologies overlook feature
semantics in feature extraction and focus on optimizing action proposals, thus
these solutions are unsuitable for widespread adoption in high-performance IoT
applications due to the limitations in precision, such as autonomous driving,
which necessitate robust and scalable intelligent video analytics analysis. To
address this issue, we propose a novel generative attention-based model to
learn the relation of feature semantics. Specifically, by leveraging the
differences of actions' foreground and background, our model simultaneously
learns the frame- and segment-dependencies of temporal action feature
semantics, which takes advantage of feature semantics in the feature extraction
effectively. To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct extensive
experiments on two benchmark video task, action recognition and action
detection. In the context of action detection tasks, we substantiate the
superiority of our approach through comprehensive validation on widely
recognized datasets. Moreover, we extend the validation of the effectiveness of
our proposed method to a broader task, video action recognition. Our code is
available at https://github.com/Generative-Feature-Model/GAF.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RVOS方法过度关注特征提取和时间建模，而相对忽视了分割头的设计。事实上，分割头设计仍有很大改进空间，特别是在边界分割能力方面。

Method: 1) 创新性地整合现有分割方法增强边界分割能力；2) 利用文本到视频扩散模型进行特征提取，移除传统噪声预测模块以避免随机性影响；3) 设计时间上下文掩码细化(TCMR)模块克服VAE特征提取能力有限的问题。

Result: 在四个公开的RVOS基准测试中一致实现了最先进的性能，显著提高了分割质量。

Conclusion: 通过改进分割头设计、简化模型结构并引入有效的细化模块，可以在不增加复杂设计的情况下显著提升Referring Video Object Segmentation的性能。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment specific objects
in a video according to textual descriptions. We observe that recent RVOS
approaches often place excessive emphasis on feature extraction and temporal
modeling, while relatively neglecting the design of the segmentation head. In
fact, there remains considerable room for improvement in segmentation head
design. To address this, we propose a Temporal-Conditional Referring Video
Object Segmentation model, which innovatively integrates existing segmentation
methods to effectively enhance boundary segmentation capability. Furthermore,
our model leverages a text-to-video diffusion model for feature extraction. On
top of this, we remove the traditional noise prediction module to avoid the
randomness of noise from degrading segmentation accuracy, thereby simplifying
the model while improving performance. Finally, to overcome the limited feature
extraction capability of the VAE, we design a Temporal Context Mask Refinement
(TCMR) module, which significantly improves segmentation quality without
introducing complex designs. We evaluate our method on four public RVOS
benchmarks, where it consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 自动驾驶系统在恶劣环境条件下性能显著下降，但由于恶劣天气数据获取和标注成本高昂，现有数据集代表性不足，需要一种经济有效的方法来生成合成恶劣天气图像。

Method: 开发了多种数据生成管道，包括纯模拟、基于GAN和混合扩散-GAN方法。扩展了现有DA GAN以支持辅助输入，并开发了新的训练方法，结合模拟和真实图像。引入自适应混合方法减少Stable-Diffusion输出中的幻觉和伪影。

Conclusion: 提出的混合扩散-GAN方法能够有效生成逼真的恶劣天气图像，显著提升自动驾驶系统在恶劣环境条件下的感知性能，为解决恶劣天气数据稀缺问题提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) systems exhibit markedly degraded performance under
adverse environmental conditions, such as low illumination and precipitation.
The underrepresentation of adverse conditions in AD datasets makes it
challenging to address this deficiency. To circumvent the prohibitive cost of
acquiring and annotating adverse weather data, we propose a novel Domain
Adaptation (DA) pipeline that transforms clear-weather images into fog, rain,
snow, and nighttime images. Here, we systematically develop and evaluate
several novel data-generation pipelines, including simulation-only, GAN-based,
and hybrid diffusion-GAN approaches, to synthesize photorealistic adverse
images from labelled clear images. We leverage an existing DA GAN, extend it to
support auxiliary inputs, and develop a novel training recipe that leverages
both simulated and real images. The simulated images facilitate exact
supervision by providing perfectly matched image pairs, while the real images
help bridge the simulation-to-real (sim2real) gap. We further introduce a
method to mitigate hallucinations and artifacts in Stable-Diffusion
Image-to-Image (img2img) outputs by blending them adaptively with their
progenitor images. We finetune downstream models on our synthetic data and
evaluate them on the Adverse Conditions Dataset with Correspondences (ACDC). We
achieve 1.85 percent overall improvement in semantic segmentation, and 4.62
percent on nighttime, demonstrating the efficacy of our hybrid method for
robust AD perception under challenging conditions.

TL;DR: MaMe是一种专门为基于状态空间模型(SSM)的视觉模型设计的token合并策略，通过利用状态转移参数Δ量化token重要性并保持序列特性，在保持性能的同时显著提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 状态空间模型在计算机视觉中表现出强大能力，但计算效率仍需提升。虽然token减少是提高模型效率的有效方法，但将其应用于SSM时需要特别考虑其独特的序列建模能力。

Method: 提出MaMe token合并策略：1) 利用状态转移参数Δ作为信息量度量指标来量化token重要性；2) 引入战略性token排列以保持序列信息流；3) 针对SSM架构特点进行定制化设计。

Result: 实验表明MaMe在效率和性能之间取得了优越的平衡，即使在激进的token减少情况下也能保持鲁棒性，而现有方法会出现显著性能下降。该方法在图像分类、视频和音频等多个领域都展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MaMe为SSM模型提供了一种有效的效率提升方法，通过专门设计的token合并策略成功解决了SSM架构中token减少的独特挑战，为多样化SSM应用建立了有效的效率增强途径。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as powerful architectures in computer
vision, yet improving their computational efficiency remains crucial for
practical and scalable deployment.While token reduction serves as an effective
approach for model efficiency, applying it to SSMs requires careful
consideration of their unique sequential modeling capabilities.In this work, we
propose MaMe, a token-merging strategy tailored for SSM-based vision
models.MaMe addresses two key challenges: quantifying token importance and
preserving sequential properties. Our approach leverages the state transition
parameter $\mathbf{\Delta}$ as an informativeness measure and introduces
strategic token arrangements to preserve sequential information flow.Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MaMe achieves superior efficiency-performance
trade-offs for both fine-tuned and off-the-shelf models. Particularly, our
approach maintains robustness even under aggressive token reduction where
existing methods undergo significant performance degradation.Beyond image
classification, MaMe shows strong generalization capabilities across video and
audio domains, establishing an effective approach for enhancing efficiency in
diverse SSM applications.

TL;DR: FoundationSSC是一个用于3D语义场景补全的新框架，通过源级和路径级的双重解耦设计，分别处理语义和几何信息，解决了现有方法中语义和几何需求冲突的问题，在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于相机的3D语义场景补全方法使用耦合编码器同时处理语义和几何先验，这迫使模型在冲突需求之间做出权衡，限制了整体性能。

Method: 提出双重解耦框架：源级使用基础编码器提供语义特征先验和立体成本体积；路径级通过专门解耦路径精炼先验；使用混合视图变换生成互补3D特征；引入轴感知融合模块各向异性地融合特征。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI上相比之前最佳方法提升+0.23 mIoU和+2.03 IoU；在SSCBench-KITTI-360上达到21.78 mIoU和48.61 IoU的state-of-the-art性能。

Conclusion: FoundationSSC通过双重解耦设计有效解决了语义和几何感知的冲突问题，在3D语义场景补全任务中实现了显著的性能提升，证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Camera-based 3D semantic scene completion (SSC) provides dense geometric and
semantic perception for autonomous driving and robotic navigation. However,
existing methods rely on a coupled encoder to deliver both semantic and
geometric priors, which forces the model to make a trade-off between
conflicting demands and limits its overall performance. To tackle these
challenges, we propose FoundationSSC, a novel framework that performs dual
decoupling at both the source and pathway levels. At the source level, we
introduce a foundation encoder that provides rich semantic feature priors for
the semantic branch and high-fidelity stereo cost volumes for the geometric
branch. At the pathway level, these priors are refined through specialised,
decoupled pathways, yielding superior semantic context and depth distributions.
Our dual-decoupling design produces disentangled and refined inputs, which are
then utilised by a hybrid view transformation to generate complementary 3D
features. Additionally, we introduce a novel Axis-Aware Fusion (AAF) module
that addresses the often-overlooked challenge of fusing these features by
anisotropically merging them into a unified representation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the advantages of FoundationSSC, achieving simultaneous
improvements in both semantic and geometric metrics, surpassing prior bests by
+0.23 mIoU and +2.03 IoU on SemanticKITTI. Additionally, we achieve
state-of-the-art performance on SSCBench-KITTI-360, with 21.78 mIoU and 48.61
IoU. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: With the growing demand for short videos and personalized content, automated
Video Log (Vlog) generation has become a key direction in multimodal content
creation. Existing methods mostly rely on predefined scripts, lacking dynamism
and personal expression. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an automated
Vlog generation approach that enables effective multimodal collaboration and
high personalization. To this end, we propose PersonaVlog, an automated
multimodal stylized Vlog generation framework that can produce personalized
Vlogs featuring videos, background music, and inner monologue speech based on a
given theme and reference image. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent
collaboration framework based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). This
framework efficiently generates high-quality prompts for multimodal content
creation based on user input, thereby improving the efficiency and creativity
of the process. In addition, we incorporate a feedback and rollback mechanism
that leverages MLLMs to evaluate and provide feedback on generated results,
thereby enabling iterative self-correction of multimodal content. We also
propose ThemeVlogEval, a theme-based automated benchmarking framework that
provides standardized metrics and datasets for fair evaluation. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the significant advantages and potential of our
framework over several baselines, highlighting its effectiveness and great
potential for generating automated Vlogs.

Abstract: Face mask detection has become increasingly important recently, particularly
during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many face detection models have been developed in
smart entryways using IoT. However, there is a lack of IoT development on face
mask detection. This paper proposes a two-factor authentication system for
smart entryway access control using facial recognition and passcode
verification and an automation process to alert the owner and activate the
surveillance system when a stranger is detected and controls the system
remotely via Telegram on a Raspberry Pi platform. The system employs the Local
Binary Patterns Histograms for the full face recognition algorithm and modified
LBPH algorithm for occluded face detection. On average, the system achieved an
Accuracy of approximately 70%, a Precision of approximately 80%, and a Recall
of approximately 83.26% across all tested users. The results indicate that the
system is capable of conducting face recognition and mask detection, automating
the operation of the remote control to register users, locking or unlocking the
door, and notifying the owner. The sample participants highly accept it for
future use in the user acceptance test.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head synthesis has achieved remarkable photorealism, yet
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models exhibit a critical failure: they lack
generalization to the full spectrum of human diversity in ethnicity, language,
and age groups. We argue that this generalization gap is a direct symptom of
limitations in existing training data, which lack the necessary scale, quality,
and diversity. To address this challenge, we introduce TalkVid, a new
large-scale, high-quality, and diverse dataset containing 1244 hours of video
from 7729 unique speakers. TalkVid is curated through a principled, multi-stage
automated pipeline that rigorously filters for motion stability, aesthetic
quality, and facial detail, and is validated against human judgments to ensure
its reliability. Furthermore, we construct and release TalkVid-Bench, a
stratified evaluation set of 500 clips meticulously balanced across key
demographic and linguistic axes. Our experiments demonstrate that a model
trained on TalkVid outperforms counterparts trained on previous datasets,
exhibiting superior cross-dataset generalization. Crucially, our analysis on
TalkVid-Bench reveals performance disparities across subgroups that are
obscured by traditional aggregate metrics, underscoring its necessity for
future research. Code and data can be found in

Result: 在基准数据集上表现出高效性和优越的准确性，超越了之前的RGB方法

Conclusion: 该方法为使用RGB图像推进类别级物体姿态估计提供了新的视角，在现实场景中无需深度数据即可实现准确估计

Abstract: While most current RGB-D-based category-level object pose estimation methods
achieve strong performance, they face significant challenges in scenes lacking
depth information. In this paper, we propose a novel category-level object pose
estimation approach that relies solely on RGB images. This method enables
accurate pose estimation in real-world scenarios without the need for depth
data. Specifically, we design a transformer-based neural network for
category-level object pose estimation, where the transformer is employed to
predict and fuse the geometric features of the target object. To ensure that
these predicted geometric features faithfully capture the object's geometry, we
introduce a geometric feature-guided algorithm, which enhances the network's
ability to effectively represent the object's geometric information. Finally,
we utilize the RANSAC-PnP algorithm to compute the object's pose, addressing
the challenges associated with variable object scales in pose estimation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach is not
only highly efficient but also achieves superior accuracy compared to previous
RGB-based methods. These promising results offer a new perspective for
advancing category-level object pose estimation using RGB images.

Conclusion: DiffIER是一个即插即用的优化框架，能有效减少训练-推理差距，提高扩散模型的生成质量，具有广泛的适用性

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating
high-quality samples and enhancing performance across diverse domains through
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). However, the quality of generated samples is
highly sensitive to the selection of the guidance weight. In this work, we
identify a critical ``training-inference gap'' and we argue that it is the
presence of this gap that undermines the performance of conditional generation
and renders outputs highly sensitive to the guidance weight. We quantify this
gap by measuring the accumulated error during the inference stage and establish
a correlation between the selection of guidance weight and minimizing this gap.
Furthermore, to mitigate this gap, we propose DiffIER, an optimization-based
method for high-quality generation. We demonstrate that the accumulated error
can be effectively reduced by an iterative error minimization at each step
during inference. By introducing this novel plug-and-play optimization
framework, we enable the optimization of errors at every single inference step
and enhance generation quality. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed
method outperforms baseline approaches in conditional generation tasks.
Furthermore, the method achieves consistent success in text-to-image
generation, image super-resolution, and text-to-speech generation, underscoring
its versatility and potential for broad applications in future research.

Motivation: 现有虚拟试穿方法主要关注服装，缺乏对其他可穿戴物品的支持，且数据配对困难。本文旨在开发一个统一框架，支持各种可穿戴物品的无掩码试穿。

Method: 采用两阶段训练流程：第一阶段利用大规模无配对图像训练无掩码定位模型，通过重用途修复模型自动在合适位置绘制物品；第二阶段使用少量配对图像微调，保持物品外观一致性。

Conclusion: OmniTry成功扩展了虚拟试穿的应用范围，为各种可穿戴物品提供了有效的无掩码试穿解决方案，在定位精度和外观保持方面表现出色。

Abstract: Virtual Try-ON (VTON) is a practical and widely-applied task, for which most
of existing works focus on clothes. This paper presents OmniTry, a unified
framework that extends VTON beyond garment to encompass any wearable objects,
e.g., jewelries and accessories, with mask-free setting for more practical
application. When extending to various types of objects, data curation is
challenging for obtaining paired images, i.e., the object image and the
corresponding try-on result. To tackle this problem, we propose a two-staged
pipeline: For the first stage, we leverage large-scale unpaired images, i.e.,
portraits with any wearable items, to train the model for mask-free
localization. Specifically, we repurpose the inpainting model to automatically
draw objects in suitable positions given an empty mask. For the second stage,
the model is further fine-tuned with paired images to transfer the consistency
of object appearance. We observed that the model after the first stage shows
quick convergence even with few paired samples. OmniTry is evaluated on a
comprehensive benchmark consisting of 12 common classes of wearable objects,
with both in-shop and in-the-wild images. Experimental results suggest that
OmniTry shows better performance on both object localization and
ID-preservation compared with existing methods. The code, model weights, and
evaluation benchmark of OmniTry will be made publicly available at

TL;DR: DeH4R是一种新颖的混合模型，结合了图生成方法的效率和图增长方法的动态性，通过解耦任务实现动态顶点插入，在保持快速推理速度的同时提高了道路网络提取的拓扑保真度和空间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在局限性：基于分割的方法在矢量化后处理中难以保持拓扑保真度；图增长方法计算成本高；图生成方法限制了顶点的动态插入。需要一种能同时兼顾效率和动态性的解决方案。

Method: 将任务解耦为四个步骤：候选顶点检测、相邻顶点预测、初始图构建和图扩展。这种架构创新允许动态顶点（边）插入，同时保持快速推理速度。

Result: 在CityScale和SpaceNet基准测试中达到最先进性能，比之前的SOTA方法RNGDet++在CityScale上APLS提高4.62，IoU提高10.18，同时速度提升约10倍。

Conclusion: DeH4R成功解决了道路网络提取中的关键挑战，实现了拓扑感知的高效推理，为遥感影像中的道路网络图提取提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The automated extraction of complete and precise road network graphs from
remote sensing imagery remains a critical challenge in geospatial computer
vision. Segmentation-based approaches, while effective in pixel-level
recognition, struggle to maintain topology fidelity after vectorization
postprocessing. Graph-growing methods build more topologically faithful graphs
but suffer from computationally prohibitive iterative ROI cropping.
Graph-generating methods first predict global static candidate road network
vertices, and then infer possible edges between vertices. They achieve fast
topology-aware inference, but limits the dynamic insertion of vertices. To
address these challenges, we propose DeH4R, a novel hybrid model that combines
graph-generating efficiency and graph-growing dynamics. This is achieved by
decoupling the task into candidate vertex detection, adjacent vertex
prediction, initial graph contruction, and graph expansion. This architectural
innovation enables dynamic vertex (edge) insertions while retaining fast
inference speed and enhancing both topology fidelity and spatial consistency.
Comprehensive evaluations on CityScale and SpaceNet benchmarks demonstrate
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. DeH4R outperforms the prior SOTA
graph-growing method RNGDet++ by 4.62 APLS and 10.18 IoU on CityScale, while
being approximately 10 $\times$ faster. The code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/7777777FAN/DeH4R.

TL;DR: HumanPCR是一个评估多模态大模型在人类相关视觉上下文理解能力的三层次评估套件，包含感知、理解和推理三个层级，包含6000+人工验证问题和视频推理测试，发现现有模型在人类中心视觉理解方面存在显著挑战


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态模型的快速发展，追求人工通用智能需要模型在多样化环境中具备人类可比性能，但现有基准测试经常忽略对人类相关视觉上下文理解能力的评估

Method: 提出HumanPCR评估套件，包含三个层次：Human-P（感知层）、Human-C（理解层）和Human-R（推理层）。前两层包含6000+人工验证的多选题，评估9个维度的任务；第三层提供手动策划的视频推理测试，需要整合多个视觉证据和主动提取上下文

Result: 对30多个最先进模型的广泛评估显示，在人类中心视觉理解方面存在显著挑战，特别是在详细空间感知、时间理解和心智建模任务中。模型在从多样化人类场景中提取主动视觉证据方面表现挣扎，过度依赖查询引导检索

Conclusion: HumanPCR评估套件和发现将推动多模态模型的开发、评估和人类中心应用，即使使用先进的视觉上下文扩展和测试时思考技术也只能带来有限收益

Abstract: The aspiration for artificial general intelligence, fueled by the rapid
progress of multimodal models, demands human-comparable performance across
diverse environments. We propose HumanPCR, an evaluation suite for probing
MLLMs' capacity about human-related visual contexts across three hierarchical
levels: Perception, Comprehension, and Reasoning (denoted by Human-P, Human-C,
and Human-R, respectively). Human-P and Human-C feature over 6,000
human-verified multiple choice questions, assessing massive tasks of 9
dimensions, including but not limited to essential skills frequently overlooked
by existing benchmarks. Human-R offers a challenging manually curated video
reasoning test that requires integrating multiple visual evidences, proactively
extracting context beyond question cues, and applying human-like expertise.
Each question includes human-annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales with
key visual evidence to support further research. Extensive evaluations on over
30 state-of-the-art models exhibit significant challenges in human-centric
visual understanding, particularly in tasks involving detailed space
perception, temporal understanding, and mind modeling. Moreover, analysis of
Human-R reveals the struggle of models in extracting essential proactive visual
evidence from diverse human scenes and their faulty reliance on query-guided
retrieval. Even with advanced techniques like scaling visual contexts and
test-time thinking yield only limited benefits. We hope HumanPCR and our
findings will advance the development, evaluation, and human-centric
application of multimodal models.

TL;DR: 提出DCMamba框架，通过数据、网络和特征三个层面的多样性增强策略，改进半监督医学图像分割性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像标注成本高昂，半监督学习可缓解标注负担。Mamba等状态空间模型擅长处理长程依赖，值得探索其在半监督医学图像分割中的应用潜力

Method: 1) 数据层面：基于Mamba扫描特性的补丁级弱-强混合增强；2) 网络层面：多样扫描协作模块利用不同扫描方向的预测差异；3) 特征层面：不确定性加权对比学习增强特征表示多样性

Result: 在Synapse数据集上，使用20%标注数据时比最新的SSM方法提升6.69%，显著优于其他半监督医学图像分割方法

Conclusion: DCMamba框架通过多角度多样性增强策略，有效提升了半监督医学图像分割性能，证明了Mamba模型在该领域的应用价值

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality annotated data for medical image segmentation is
tedious and costly. Semi-supervised segmentation techniques alleviate this
burden by leveraging unlabeled data to generate pseudo labels. Recently,
advanced state space models, represented by Mamba, have shown efficient
handling of long-range dependencies. This drives us to explore their potential
in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. In this paper, we propose a
novel Diversity-enhanced Collaborative Mamba framework (namely DCMamba) for
semi-supervised medical image segmentation, which explores and utilizes the
diversity from data, network, and feature perspectives. Firstly, from the data
perspective, we develop patch-level weak-strong mixing augmentation with
Mamba's scanning modeling characteristics. Moreover, from the network
perspective, we introduce a diverse-scan collaboration module, which could
benefit from the prediction discrepancies arising from different scanning
directions. Furthermore, from the feature perspective, we adopt an
uncertainty-weighted contrastive learning mechanism to enhance the diversity of
feature representation. Experiments demonstrate that our DCMamba significantly
outperforms other semi-supervised medical image segmentation methods, e.g.,
yielding the latest SSM-based method by 6.69% on the Synapse dataset with 20%
labeled data.

Motivation: 在线教育内容日益增多但缺乏有效组织，元宇宙为教育内容提供了沉浸式交互环境，但现有数据集较小且搜索相关元宇宙场景仍具挑战性。

Method: 引入包含457个农业主题虚拟博物馆(AgriMuseums)的新数据集，每个都带有文本描述；提出分层视觉语言模型来表示和检索相关AgriMuseums。

Conclusion: 该工作为解决农业元宇宙内容检索问题提供了有效的数据集和模型，显著提升了检索性能，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Every day, a large amount of educational content is uploaded online across
different areas, including agriculture and gardening. When these videos or
materials are grouped meaningfully, they can make learning easier and more
effective. One promising way to organize and enrich such content is through the
Metaverse, which allows users to explore educational experiences in an
interactive and immersive environment. However, searching for relevant
Metaverse scenarios and finding those matching users' interests remains a
challenging task. A first step in this direction has been done recently, but
existing datasets are small and not sufficient for training advanced models. In
this work, we make two main contributions: first, we introduce a new dataset
containing 457 agricultural-themed virtual museums (AgriMuseums), each enriched
with textual descriptions; and second, we propose a hierarchical
vision-language model to represent and retrieve relevant AgriMuseums using
natural language queries. In our experimental setting, the proposed method
achieves up to about 62\% R@1 and 78\% MRR, confirming its effectiveness, and
it also leads to improvements on existing benchmarks by up to 6\% R@1 and 11\%
MRR. Moreover, an extensive evaluation validates our design choices. Code and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出IPGA攻击方法，通过利用投影器模块的中间阶段（Q-Former）进行更精细的对抗攻击，在保持无关视觉内容的同时实现更精确的语义操控


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法在视觉语言模型中存在局限性：1）将丰富视觉语义压缩为单一全局向量，限制了攻击粒度；2）忽视了投影器模块这一关键语义桥梁，未能破坏完整的视觉-语言对齐流程

Method: IPGA方法：1）利用Q-Former中间阶段进行攻击，操作语义丰富的视觉token而非单一全局表示；2）使用仅在视觉-语言对齐第一阶段预训练的Q-Former；3）提出残差查询对齐（RQA）技术保持无关视觉内容

Result: 在标准全局图像描述任务和细粒度视觉问答任务中均优于现有方法，在黑盒环境下表现一致优异，且成功迁移到多个商业VLM（Google Gemini、OpenAI GPT）

Conclusion: IPGA通过攻击投影器模块中间阶段实现了更精细和有效的对抗攻击，解决了现有方法在攻击粒度和完整性方面的局限性，具有很好的迁移性和实用性

Abstract: Targeted adversarial attacks are essential for proactively identifying
security flaws in Vision-Language Models before real-world deployment. However,
current methods perturb images to maximize global similarity with the target
text or reference image at the encoder level, collapsing rich visual semantics
into a single global vector. This limits attack granularity, hindering
fine-grained manipulations such as modifying a car while preserving its
background. Furthermore, these methods largely overlook the projector module, a
critical semantic bridge between the visual encoder and the language model in
VLMs, thereby failing to disrupt the full vision-language alignment pipeline
within VLMs and limiting attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we
propose the Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA), the first method to
attack using the intermediate stage of the projector module, specifically the
widely adopted Q-Former, which transforms global image embeddings into
fine-grained visual features. This enables more precise control over
adversarial perturbations by operating on semantically meaningful visual tokens
rather than a single global representation. Specifically, IPGA leverages the
Q-Former pretrained solely on the first vision-language alignment stage,
without LLM fine-tuning, which improves both attack effectiveness and
transferability across diverse VLMs. Furthermore, we propose Residual Query
Alignment (RQA) to preserve unrelated visual content, thereby yielding more
controlled and precise adversarial manipulations. Extensive experiments show
that our attack method consistently outperforms existing methods in both
standard global image captioning tasks and fine-grained visual
question-answering tasks in black-box environment. Additionally, IPGA
successfully transfers to multiple commercial VLMs, including Google Gemini and
OpenAI GPT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOCUS是一种无需训练的解码策略，通过顺序掩码图像来缓解多图像输入时的信息泄漏问题，提升大型视觉语言模型在多图像任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在单图像任务上表现良好，但在处理多图像输入时性能显著下降，因为不同图像的视觉线索在模型输出中相互干扰，出现跨图像信息泄漏问题。

Method: 提出FOCUS解码策略：1）顺序用随机噪声掩码除一张图像外的所有图像，使模型专注于单张干净图像；2）对所有目标图像重复此过程获得部分掩码上下文下的logits；3）聚合logits并使用纯噪声参考输入进行对比精炼，抑制信息泄漏。

Result: FOCUS在四个多图像基准测试和多种LVLM模型家族中一致提升性能，证明其通用性和实用性。

Conclusion: FOCUS提供了一种无需额外训练或架构修改的通用实用解决方案，可有效增强多图像推理能力。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong performance on
single-image tasks. However, we observe that their performance degrades
significantly when handling multi-image inputs. This occurs because visual cues
from different images become entangled in the model's output. We refer to this
phenomenon as cross-image information leakage. To address this issue, we
propose FOCUS, a training-free and architecture-agnostic decoding strategy that
mitigates cross-image information leakage during inference. FOCUS sequentially
masks all but one image with random noise, guiding the model to focus on the
single clean image. We repeat this process across all target images to obtain
logits under partially masked contexts. These logits are aggregated and then
contrastively refined using a noise-only reference input, which suppresses the
leakage and yields more accurate outputs. FOCUS consistently improves
performance across four multi-image benchmarks and diverse LVLM families. This
demonstrates that FOCUS offers a general and practical solution for enhancing
multi-image reasoning without additional training or architectural
modifications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多相机3D形状非刚性配准方法，使用广义相机模型处理任意视角和正交相机配置，通过凸规划和迭代优化实现高精度重建


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单图像3D形状配准方法（SfT）存在局限性，多相机联合信息可以为医学成像和手持相机等应用场景提供新的可能性，但多相机SfT问题尚未得到系统解决

Method: 提出三种方法：1）已知空间3D点的方向向量对应点；2）未知3D点但已知局部参考系方向的对应点；3）除对应点外还已知成像对象轮廓的方法。前两种使用凸规划，第三种通过迭代优化凸解结果

Result: 在大量合成和真实数据上验证了所提方法的准确性，证明了多相机约束能显著提高变形形状估计的重建精度

Conclusion: 这是首个解决广义相机SfT问题的系统方案，通过利用多视角间的相互约束，为3D形状非刚性配准提供了更精确和通用的解决方案

Abstract: This article presents a new method for non-rigidly registering a 3D shape to
2D keypoints observed by a constellation of multiple cameras. Non-rigid
registration of a 3D shape to observed 2D keypoints, i.e., Shape-from-Template
(SfT), has been widely studied using single images, but SfT with information
from multiple-cameras jointly opens new directions for extending the scope of
known use-cases such as 3D shape registration in medical imaging and
registration from hand-held cameras, to name a few. We represent such
multi-camera setup with the generalised camera model; therefore any collection
of perspective or orthographic cameras observing any deforming object can be
registered. We propose multiple approaches for such SfT: the first approach
where the corresponded keypoints lie on a direction vector from a known 3D
point in space, the second approach where the corresponded keypoints lie on a
direction vector from an unknown 3D point in space but with known orientation
w.r.t some local reference frame, and a third approach where, apart from
correspondences, the silhouette of the imaged object is also known. Together,
these form the first set of solutions to the SfT problem with generalised
cameras. The key idea behind SfT with generalised camera is the improved
reconstruction accuracy from estimating deformed shape while utilising the
additional information from the mutual constraints between multiple views of a
deformed object. The correspondence-based approaches are solved with convex
programming while the silhouette-based approach is an iterative refinement of
the results from the convex solutions. We demonstrate the accuracy of our
proposed methods on many synthetic and real data

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisionLaw是一个双层优化框架，通过视觉观察推断可解释的内在动力学表达式，使用LLM作为物理专家生成和修订本构定律，并通过视觉模拟评估一致性，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在从视觉观察推断物体内在动力学时面临两大挑战：一是依赖手动定义的本构先验，难以泛化到复杂场景；二是使用神经网络建模，可解释性差且泛化能力有限。

Method: 提出双层优化框架：上层使用LLM驱动的解耦本构演化策略，LLM作为物理专家生成和修订本构定律；下层使用视觉引导的本构评估机制，通过视觉模拟评估生成定律与内在动力学的一致性。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，VisionLaw能有效从视觉观察推断可解释的内在动力学，显著优于现有最先进方法，在新场景的交互模拟中表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: VisionLaw框架成功解决了内在动力学推断的可解释性和泛化性问题，为物理交互模拟提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The intrinsic dynamics of an object governs its physical behavior in the real
world, playing a critical role in enabling physically plausible interactive
simulation with 3D assets. Existing methods have attempted to infer the
intrinsic dynamics of objects from visual observations, but generally face two
major challenges: one line of work relies on manually defined constitutive
priors, making it difficult to generalize to complex scenarios; the other
models intrinsic dynamics using neural networks, resulting in limited
interpretability and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we
propose VisionLaw, a bilevel optimization framework that infers interpretable
expressions of intrinsic dynamics from visual observations. At the upper level,
we introduce an LLMs-driven decoupled constitutive evolution strategy, where
LLMs are prompted as a knowledgeable physics expert to generate and revise
constitutive laws, with a built-in decoupling mechanism that substantially
reduces the search complexity of LLMs. At the lower level, we introduce a
vision-guided constitutive evaluation mechanism, which utilizes visual
simulation to evaluate the consistency between the generated constitutive law
and the underlying intrinsic dynamics, thereby guiding the upper-level
evolution. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that VisionLaw can effectively infer interpretable intrinsic dynamics from
visual observations. It significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods and exhibits strong generalization for interactive simulation in novel
scenarios.

TL;DR: Med-CTX是一个基于Transformer的多模态框架，用于可解释的乳腺癌超声分割，整合临床放射学报告提升性能和可解释性，在BUS-BRA数据集上达到Dice分数99%和IoU 95%的优异表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高乳腺癌超声分割的准确性和可解释性，通过整合临床文本信息来增强模型性能并提供临床依据的解释，增加计算机辅助诊断的可信度和透明度。

Method: 使用双分支视觉编码器（ViT和Swin Transformer）结合不确定性感知融合，通过BioClinicalBERT编码结构化临床语言（BI-RADS语义），利用跨模态注意力融合视觉和文本特征，同时生成分割掩码、不确定性图和诊断理由。

Result: 在BUS-BRA数据集上达到Dice分数99%和IoU 95%，超越U-Net、ViT和Swin等基线模型；多模态对齐CLIP分数85%，置信度校准ECE 3.2%；消融研究显示临床文本对分割准确性（Dice下降5.4%）和解释质量（CIDEr下降31%）至关重要。

Conclusion: Med-CTX为可信赖的多模态医学架构设立了新标准，通过整合临床文本显著提升了分割性能和解释质量，证明了多模态方法在医学影像分析中的重要性。

Abstract: We introduce Med-CTX, a fully transformer based multimodal framework for
explainable breast cancer ultrasound segmentation. We integrate clinical
radiology reports to boost both performance and interpretability. Med-CTX
achieves exact lesion delineation by using a dual-branch visual encoder that
combines ViT and Swin transformers, as well as uncertainty aware fusion.
Clinical language structured with BI-RADS semantics is encoded by
BioClinicalBERT and combined with visual features utilising cross-modal
attention, allowing the model to provide clinically grounded, model generated
explanations. Our methodology generates segmentation masks, uncertainty maps,
and diagnostic rationales all at once, increasing confidence and transparency
in computer assisted diagnosis. On the BUS-BRA dataset, Med-CTX achieves a Dice
score of 99% and an IoU of 95%, beating existing baselines U-Net, ViT, and
Swin. Clinical text plays a key role in segmentation accuracy and explanation
quality, as evidenced by ablation studies that show a -5.4% decline in Dice
score and -31% in CIDEr. Med-CTX achieves good multimodal alignment (CLIP
score: 85%) and increased confi dence calibration (ECE: 3.2%), setting a new
bar for trustworthy, multimodal medical architecture.

Motivation: 城市树木生物多样性对气候遭忍性和生态稳定性至关重要，但传统量丰方法成本高、耗时，而有监督AI方法需要标签数据且跨区域通用性差

Method: 无监督聚类框架，整合街道级图像的视觉嵌入表征和空间种植模式，无需标签数据进行生物多样性估算

Result: 在8个北美城市应用，方法能高保真度恢复属级多样性模式，对Shannon和Simpson指数获得低Wasserstein距离，保持空间自相关性

Conclusion: 该可扩展、细粒度方法能够在缺乏详细量丰的城市进行生物多样性制图，为持续、低成本监测提供途径，支持公平获得绿化和城市生态系统适应性管理

Abstract: Urban tree biodiversity is critical for climate resilience, ecological
stability, and livability in cities, yet most municipalities lack detailed
knowledge of their canopies. Field-based inventories provide reliable estimates
of Shannon and Simpson diversity but are costly and time-consuming, while
supervised AI methods require labeled data that often fail to generalize across
regions. We introduce an unsupervised clustering framework that integrates
visual embeddings from street-level imagery with spatial planting patterns to
estimate biodiversity without labels. Applied to eight North American cities,
the method recovers genus-level diversity patterns with high fidelity,
achieving low Wasserstein distances to ground truth for Shannon and Simpson
indices and preserving spatial autocorrelation. This scalable, fine-grained
approach enables biodiversity mapping in cities lacking detailed inventories
and offers a pathway for continuous, low-cost monitoring to support equitable
access to greenery and adaptive management of urban ecosystems.

Conclusion: SA3通过有效的对齐机制和识别策略，成功实现了源域与目标域之间的局部-全局适应性对齐，在跨域物体检测任务中取得了优异的性能

Abstract: Achieving top-notch performance in Intelligent Transportation detection is a
critical research area. However, many challenges still need to be addressed
when it comes to detecting in a cross-domain scenario. In this paper, we
propose a Self-Aware Adaptive Alignment (SA3), by leveraging an efficient
alignment mechanism and recognition strategy. Our proposed method employs a
specified attention-based alignment module trained on source and target domain
datasets to guide the image-level features alignment process, enabling the
local-global adaptive alignment between the source domain and target domain.
Features from both domains, whose channel importance is re-weighted, are fed
into the region proposal network, which facilitates the acquisition of salient
region features. Also, we introduce an instance-to-image level alignment module
specific to the target domain to adaptively mitigate the domain gap. To
evaluate the proposed method, extensive experiments have been conducted on
popular cross-domain object detection benchmarks. Experimental results show
that SA3 achieves superior results to the previous state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的文本到图像模型在视觉效果上显著，但经常无法精确对齐文本提示，导致缺失关键元素或不期望的概念混合

Method: 提出一种新题方法，学习来自高成功率分布的条件化分布，在去噪过程中显式建模信号组件，提供细粒度控制

Result: 大量实验证明，该方法在性能上超过了当前最先进的方法

Conclusion: 该方法不需要训练，可以无缝集成到现有的扩散咆流匹配架构中，还支持附加条件如边框来提升空间对齐

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models produce visually impressive results but
often struggle with precise alignment to text prompts, leading to missing
critical elements or unintended blending of distinct concepts. We propose a
novel approach that learns a high-success-rate distribution conditioned on a
target prompt, ensuring that generated images faithfully reflect the
corresponding prompts. Our method explicitly models the signal component during
the denoising process, offering fine-grained control that mitigates
over-optimization and out-of-distribution artifacts. Moreover, our framework is
training-free and seamlessly integrates with both existing diffusion and flow
matching architectures. It also supports additional conditioning modalities --
such as bounding boxes -- for enhanced spatial alignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. The

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了两个现实的增量学习目标检测基准(RICO)，证明现有增量学习方法在现实场景下表现较差，而重放少量旧数据的简单方法却更有效，但仍不及独立训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增量学习(IL)虽然具有隐私保护、效率和可扩展性优势，但当前评估多使用简化的合成基准，影响了对现实世界IL性能的准确评估。

Method: 构建了两个现实增量学习目标检测基准(RICO)：域RICO(D-RICO)包含域偏移但类别固定，扩展类RICO(EC-RICO)每个IL步骤都添加新域和新类。基准来自14个多样化数据集，涵盖真实和合成域、不同条件(天气、时间)、摄像头和标注策略。

Result: 实验显示所有IL方法在适应性和知识保留方面都表现差强，而重放少量旧数据的简单方法已经超过所有IL方法，但仍不及对数据进行独立训练的性能。

Conclusion: 研究认为IL方法的性能差距可能来自于识别中弱教师问题、单一模型无法处理多样任务以及不足的可塑性。该研究为现实增量学习领域提供了更准确的评估基准。

Abstract: Incremental Learning (IL) trains models sequentially on new data without full
retraining, offering privacy, efficiency, and scalability. IL must balance
adaptability to new data with retention of old knowledge. However, evaluations
often rely on synthetic, simplified benchmarks, obscuring real-world IL
performance. To address this, we introduce two Realistic Incremental Object
Detection Benchmarks (RICO): Domain RICO (D-RICO) features domain shifts with a
fixed class set, and Expanding-Classes RICO (EC-RICO) integrates new domains
and classes per IL step. Built from 14 diverse datasets covering real and
synthetic domains, varying conditions (e.g., weather, time of day), camera
sensors, perspectives, and labeling policies, both benchmarks capture
challenges absent in existing evaluations. Our experiments show that all IL
methods underperform in adaptability and retention, while replaying a small
amount of previous data already outperforms all methods. However, individual
training on the data remains superior. We heuristically attribute this gap to
weak teachers in distillation, single models' inability to manage diverse
tasks, and insufficient plasticity. Our code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: LCRReg是一种新的正则化方法，利用潜在概念表示(LCRs)引导医学影像深度学习模型学习语义基础的表征，提高对分布偏移的鲁棒性，无需主训练集中的概念标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像深度学习模型往往依赖虚假相关性而非临床有意义的特征，在分布偏移下泛化能力差。需要一种方法能引导模型学习语义基础的表征。

Method: 使用小型辅助数据集合成高质量、解耦的概念示例，提取预定义相关特征的LCRs，通过正则化项引导CNN在相关概念潜在子空间内激活。

Result: 在合成和真实医学任务中验证有效：在受控数据集上显著提高对注入虚假相关性的鲁棒性；在糖尿病视网膜病变分类任务中提升合成扰动和OOD泛化性能。

Conclusion: LCRReg提供了一种轻量级、架构无关的策略，无需密集概念监督即可提高模型鲁棒性，优于多任务学习、线性探测等基线方法。

Abstract: Deep learning models in medical imaging often achieve strong in-distribution
performance but struggle to generalise under distribution shifts, frequently
relying on spurious correlations instead of clinically meaningful features. We
introduce LCRReg, a novel regularisation approach that leverages Latent Concept
Representations (LCRs) (e.g., Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs)) to guide
models toward semantically grounded representations. LCRReg requires no concept
labels in the main training set and instead uses a small auxiliary dataset to
synthesise high-quality, disentangled concept examples. We extract LCRs for
predefined relevant features, and incorporate a regularisation term that guides
a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to activate within latent subspaces
associated with those concepts. We evaluate LCRReg across synthetic and
real-world medical tasks. On a controlled toy dataset, it significantly
improves robustness to injected spurious correlations and remains effective
even in multi-concept and multiclass settings. On the diabetic retinopathy
binary classification task, LCRReg enhances performance under both synthetic
spurious perturbations and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation. Compared
to baselines, including multitask learning, linear probing, and post-hoc
concept-based models, LCRReg offers a lightweight, architecture-agnostic
strategy for improving model robustness without requiring dense concept
supervision. Code is available at the following link:

TL;DR: 单元素水平预测模型，使用Sentinel-5P数据和ConvLSTM网络，能够在5天间隔预测氧化吐沙指数，为南亚霾霉提供时效性预报


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 南亚地区年度霾霉事件严重，污染物污染源增多但缺乏实时区域性预报系统，需要开发精确的氧化吐沙指数预测模型

Method: 采用Sentinel-5P卫星空气成分数据(2019-2023)，构建卷积长短期记忆网络(ConvLSTM)模型，利用紫外线340-380nm波段的氧化吐沙指数作为预测因子

Result: 模型在5天间隔预测中达到平均方差错误~0.0018，损失值~0.3995，结构相似性指数~0.74，显示了良好的空间时间相关性抓取能力

Conclusion: ConvLSTM模型能够有效预测氧化吐沙指数，为南亚霾霉预报提供技术支持，但需要整合更多数据源和优化模型结构来提升性能

Abstract: The South Asian Smog refers to the recurring annual air pollution events
marked by high contaminant levels, reduced visibility, and significant
socio-economic impacts, primarily affecting the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) from
November to February. Over the past decade, increased air pollution sources
such as crop residue burning, motor vehicles, and changing weather patterns
have intensified these smog events. However, real-time forecasting systems for
increased particulate matter concentrations are still not established at
regional scale. The Aerosol Index, closely tied to smog formation and a key
component in calculating the Air Quality Index (AQI), reflects particulate
matter concentrations. This study forecasts aerosol events using Sentinel-5P
air constituent data (2019-2023) and a Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory
(ConvLSTM) neural network, which captures spatial and temporal correlations
more effectively than previous models. Using the Ultraviolet (UV) Aerosol Index
at 340-380 nm as the predictor, results show the Aerosol Index can be
forecasted at five-day intervals with a Mean Squared Error of ~0.0018, loss of
~0.3995, and Structural Similarity Index of ~0.74. While effective, the model
can be improved by integrating additional data and refining its architecture.

Conclusion: 提出的SCRNet通过巧妙融合卷积和注意力机制，有效解决了医学图像分割中长距离依赖和局部上下文信息的平衡问题，取得了优异的分割效果。

Abstract: Medical ultrasound image segmentation presents a formidable challenge in the
realm of computer vision. Traditional approaches rely on Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based methods to address the intricacies of
medical image segmentation. Nevertheless, inherent limitations persist, as
CNN-based methods tend to disregard long-range dependencies, while
Transformer-based methods may overlook local contextual information. To address
these deficiencies, we propose a novel Feature Aggregation Module (FAM)
designed to process two input features from the preceding layer. These features
are seamlessly directed into two branches of the Convolution and
Cross-Attention Parallel Module (CCAPM) to endow them with different roles in
each of the two branches to help establish a strong connection between the two
input features. This strategy enables our module to focus concurrently on both
long-range dependencies and local contextual information by judiciously merging
convolution operations with cross-attention mechanisms. Moreover, by
integrating FAM within our proposed Spatial-Channel Regulation Module (SCRM),
the ability to discern salient regions and informative features warranting
increased attention is enhanced. Furthermore, by incorporating the SCRM into
the encoder block of the UNet architecture, we introduce a novel framework
dubbed Spatial-Channel Regulation Network (SCRNet). The results of our
extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SCRNet, which consistently
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: PhysGM通过联合预测3D表示和物理属性，结合DPO优化和新的PhysAssets数据集，实现了快速且高质量的物理模拟4D渲染

Abstract: While physics-grounded 3D motion synthesis has seen significant progress,
current methods face critical limitations. They typically rely on
pre-reconstructed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations, while physics
integration depends on either inflexible, manually defined physical attributes
or unstable, optimization-heavy guidance from video models. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce PhysGM, a feed-forward framework that jointly predicts
a 3D Gaussian representation and its physical properties from a single image,
enabling immediate, physical simulation and high-fidelity 4D rendering. We
first establish a base model by jointly optimizing for Gaussian reconstruction
and probabilistic physics prediction. The model is then refined with physically
plausible reference videos to enhance both rendering fidelity and physics
prediction accuracy. We adopt the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align
its simulations with reference videos, circumventing Score Distillation
Sampling (SDS) optimization which needs back-propagating gradients through the
complex differentiable simulation and rasterization. To facilitate the
training, we introduce a new dataset PhysAssets of over 24,000 3D assets,
annotated with physical properties and corresponding guiding videos.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively generates
high-fidelity 4D simulations from a single image in one minute. This represents
a significant speedup over prior works while delivering realistic rendering
results. Our project page is at:https://hihixiaolv.github.io/PhysGM.github.io/

TL;DR: DIME-Net是一个双光照增强框架，通过混合专家机制自适应处理低光和背光图像，无需重新训练即可在多种光照条件下实现竞争性性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实环境中复杂光照条件（如低光和背光）会导致图像质量下降，影响下游视觉任务。现有方法通常只针对单一类型的光照退化，缺乏统一处理多样化光照条件的能力。

Method: 提出DIME-Net框架，包含混合专家光照估计模块（使用稀疏门控机制自适应选择S曲线专家网络）和损伤修复模块（配备光照感知交叉注意力和序列状态全局注意力机制）。构建混合光照数据集MixBL进行训练。

Conclusion: DIME-Net展示了在多样复杂光照条件下的泛化能力和实际多媒体应用潜力，能够统一处理多种光照退化问题。

Abstract: Image degradation caused by complex lighting conditions such as low-light and
backlit scenarios is commonly encountered in real-world environments,
significantly affecting image quality and downstream vision tasks. Most
existing methods focus on a single type of illumination degradation and lack
the ability to handle diverse lighting conditions in a unified manner. To
address this issue, we propose a dual-illumination enhancement framework called
DIME-Net. The core of our method is a Mixture-of-Experts illumination estimator
module, where a sparse gating mechanism adaptively selects suitable S-curve
expert networks based on the illumination characteristics of the input image.
By integrating Retinex theory, this module effectively performs enhancement
tailored to both low-light and backlit images. To further correct
illumination-induced artifacts and color distortions, we design a damage
restoration module equipped with Illumination-Aware Cross Attention and
Sequential-State Global Attention mechanisms. In addition, we construct a
hybrid illumination dataset, MixBL, by integrating existing datasets, allowing
our model to achieve robust illumination adaptability through a single training
process. Experimental results show that DIME-Net achieves competitive
performance on both synthetic and real-world low-light and backlit datasets
without any retraining. These results demonstrate its generalization ability
and potential for practical multimedia applications under diverse and complex
illumination conditions.

TL;DR: ViT-FIQA是一种基于Vision Transformer的人脸图像质量评估方法，通过可学习的质量token来预测人脸图像在识别系统中的效用分数，在多个基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前FIQA方法主要依赖CNN，而Vision Transformer架构在FIQA领域的潜力尚未充分探索，需要开发基于ViT的高效质量评估方法。

Method: 扩展标准ViT骨干网络，添加可学习的质量token与图像patch token拼接，通过全局自注意力聚合上下文信息，使用双头结构分别进行人脸表示学习和质量分数回归。

Result: 在多个具有挑战性的基准测试和不同FR模型（包括CNN和ViT架构）上，ViT-FIQA始终达到顶级性能。

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的架构在建模人脸图像效用方面非常有效，ViT有潜力作为未来FIQA研究的可扩展基础。

Abstract: Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) aims to predict the utility of a face
image for face recognition (FR) systems. State-of-the-art FIQA methods mainly
rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), leaving the potential of Vision
Transformer (ViT) architectures underexplored. This work proposes ViT-FIQA, a
novel approach that extends standard ViT backbones, originally optimized for
FR, through a learnable quality token designed to predict a scalar utility
score for any given face image. The learnable quality token is concatenated
with the standard image patch tokens, and the whole sequence is processed via
global self-attention by the ViT encoders to aggregate contextual information
across all patches. At the output of the backbone, ViT-FIQA branches into two
heads: (1) the patch tokens are passed through a fully connected layer to learn
discriminative face representations via a margin-penalty softmax loss, and (2)
the quality token is fed into a regression head to learn to predict the face
sample's utility. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks and several
FR models, including both CNN- and ViT-based architectures, demonstrate that
ViT-FIQA consistently achieves top-tier performance. These results underscore
the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures in modeling face image
utility and highlight the potential of ViTs as a scalable foundation for future
FIQA research https://cutt.ly/irHlzXUC.

*Tianyi Niu,Jaemin Cho,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 多模态大语言模型在识别图像旋转角度方面存在显著缺陷，特别是无法可靠区分90度和270度旋转，即使通过辅助信息、提示工程或微调也难以改善。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估多模态大语言模型在图像旋转识别任务中的视觉推理能力，测试其对空间关系和旋转线索的感知能力。

Method: 构建RotBench基准数据集（350张图像），测试多个先进MLLM模型（包括GPT-5、o3、Gemini-2.5-Pro等），使用辅助信息（标题、深度图等）、思维链提示、多角度同时展示和投票机制等方法进行改进尝试。

Result: 模型能可靠识别0度（正立）图像，部分能识别180度（倒立）图像，但都无法可靠区分90度和270度旋转。辅助信息和提示工程仅带来小幅不一致改进，微调也无法改善90/270度区分能力。

Conclusion: MLLM在空间推理能力与人类感知之间存在显著差距，特别是在旋转识别任务上表现出根本性局限。

Abstract: We investigate to what extent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can
accurately identify the orientation of input images rotated 0{\deg}, 90{\deg},
180{\deg}, and 270{\deg}. This task demands robust visual reasoning
capabilities to detect rotational cues and contextualize spatial relationships
within images, regardless of their orientation. To evaluate MLLMs on these
abilities, we introduce RotBench -- a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark
comprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Despite the relatively
simple nature of this task, we show that several state-of-the-art open and
proprietary MLLMs, including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, do not reliably
identify rotation in input images. Providing models with auxiliary information
-- including captions, depth maps, and more -- or using chain-of-thought
prompting offers only small and inconsistent improvements. Our results indicate
that most models are able to reliably identify right-side-up (0{\deg}) images,
while certain models are able to identify upside-down (180{\deg}) images. None
can reliably distinguish between 90{\deg} and 270{\deg}. Simultaneously showing
the image rotated in different orientations leads to moderate performance gains
for reasoning models, while a modified setup using voting improves the
performance of weaker models. We further show that fine-tuning does not improve
models' ability to distinguish 90{\deg} and 270{\deg} rotations, despite
substantially improving the identification of 180{\deg} images. Together, these
results reveal a significant gap between MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities
and human perception in identifying rotation.

Abstract: Depth estimation is a fundamental task for 3D scene understanding in
autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. Existing depth datasets,
such as KITTI, nuScenes, and DDAD, have advanced the field but suffer from
limitations in diversity and scalability. As benchmark performance on these
datasets approaches saturation, there is an increasing need for a new
generation of large-scale, diverse, and cost-efficient datasets to support the
era of foundation models and multi-modal learning. To address these challenges,
we introduce a large-scale, diverse, frame-wise continuous dataset for depth
estimation in dynamic outdoor driving environments, comprising 20K video frames
to evaluate existing methods. Our lightweight acquisition pipeline ensures
broad scene coverage at low cost, while sparse yet statistically sufficient
ground truth enables robust training. Compared to existing datasets, ours
presents greater diversity in driving scenarios and lower depth density,
creating new challenges for generalization. Benchmark experiments with standard
monocular depth estimation models validate the dataset's utility and highlight
substantial performance gaps in challenging conditions, establishing a new
platform for advancing depth estimation research.

Abstract: Video action detection requires dense spatio-temporal annotations, which are
both challenging and expensive to obtain. However, real-world videos often vary
in difficulty and may not require the same level of annotation. This paper
analyzes the appropriate annotation types for each sample and their impact on
spatio-temporal video action detection. It focuses on two key aspects: 1) how
to obtain varying levels of annotation for videos, and 2) how to learn action
detection from different annotation types. The study explores video-level tags,
points, scribbles, bounding boxes, and pixel-level masks. First, a simple
active learning strategy is proposed to estimate the necessary annotation type
for each video. Then, a novel spatio-temporal 3D-superpixel approach is
introduced to generate pseudo-labels from these annotations, enabling effective
training. The approach is validated on UCF101-24 and JHMDB-21 datasets,
significantly cutting annotation costs with minimal performance loss.

Abstract: Outside of urban hubs, autonomous cars and trucks have to master driving on
intercity highways. Safe, long-distance highway travel at speeds exceeding 100
km/h demands perception distances of at least 250 m, which is about five times
the 50-100m typically addressed in city driving, to allow sufficient planning
and braking margins. Increasing the perception ranges also allows to extend
autonomy from light two-ton passenger vehicles to large-scale forty-ton trucks,
which need a longer planning horizon due to their high inertia. However, most
existing perception approaches focus on shorter ranges and rely on Bird's Eye
View (BEV) representations, which incur quadratic increases in memory and
compute costs as distance grows. To overcome this limitation, we built on top
of a sparse representation and introduced an efficient 3D encoding of
multi-modal and temporal features, along with a novel self-supervised
pre-training scheme that enables large-scale learning from unlabeled
camera-LiDAR data. Our approach extends perception distances to 250 meters and
achieves an 26.6% improvement in mAP in object detection and a decrease of
30.5% in Chamfer Distance in LiDAR forecasting compared to existing methods,
reaching distances up to 250 meters. Project Page:

Conclusion: 通过智能选择非关键帧来补充关键帧的不足，能够在线生成更完整高质量的3D高斯涂射模型

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of generating online 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) models from RGB-only frames. Previous studies have employed dense SLAM
techniques to estimate 3D scenes from keyframes for 3DGS model construction.
However, these methods are limited by their reliance solely on keyframes, which
are insufficient to capture an entire scene, resulting in incomplete
reconstructions. Moreover, building a generalizable model requires
incorporating frames from diverse viewpoints to achieve broader scene coverage.
However, online processing restricts the use of many frames or extensive
training iterations. Therefore, we propose a novel method for high-quality 3DGS
modeling that improves model completeness through adaptive view selection. By
analyzing reconstruction quality online, our approach selects optimal
non-keyframes for additional training. By integrating both keyframes and
selected non-keyframes, the method refines incomplete regions from diverse
viewpoints, significantly enhancing completeness. We also present a framework
that incorporates an online multi-view stereo approach, ensuring consistency in
3D information throughout the 3DGS modeling process. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering
exceptional performance in complex outdoor scenes.

Conclusion: Noisy Alignment方法通过显式噪声对齐机制，显著提升了数据投毒后门攻击的效果和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) effectively learns transferable
representations from unlabeled data containing images or image-text pairs but
suffers vulnerability to data poisoning backdoor attacks (DPCLs). An adversary
can inject poisoned images into pretraining datasets, causing compromised CL
encoders to exhibit targeted misbehavior in downstream tasks. Existing DPCLs,
however, achieve limited efficacy due to their dependence on fragile implicit
co-occurrence between backdoor and target object and inadequate suppression of
discriminative features in backdoored images. We propose Noisy Alignment (NA),
a DPCL method that explicitly suppresses noise components in poisoned images.
Inspired by powerful training-controllable CL attacks, we identify and extract
the critical objective of noisy alignment, adapting it effectively into
data-poisoning scenarios. Our method implements noisy alignment by
strategically manipulating contrastive learning's random cropping mechanism,
formulating this process as an image layout optimization problem with
theoretically derived optimal parameters. The resulting method is simple yet
effective, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to existing DPCLs,
while maintaining clean-data accuracy. Furthermore, Noisy Alignment
demonstrates robustness against common backdoor defenses. Codes can be found at

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video AIGC have ushered in a transformative era for
audio-driven human animation. However, conventional video dubbing techniques
remain constrained to mouth region editing, resulting in discordant facial
expressions and body gestures that compromise viewer immersion. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce sparse-frame video dubbing, a novel paradigm that
strategically preserves reference keyframes to maintain identity, iconic
gestures, and camera trajectories while enabling holistic, audio-synchronized
full-body motion editing. Through critical analysis, we identify why naive
image-to-video models fail in this task, particularly their inability to
achieve adaptive conditioning. Addressing this, we propose InfiniteTalk, a
streaming audio-driven generator designed for infinite-length long sequence
dubbing. This architecture leverages temporal context frames for seamless
inter-chunk transitions and incorporates a simple yet effective sampling
strategy that optimizes control strength via fine-grained reference frame
positioning. Comprehensive evaluations on HDTF, CelebV-HQ, and EMTD datasets
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Quantitative metrics confirm superior
visual realism, emotional coherence, and full-body motion synchronization.

Conclusion: DetailGen3D通过创新的潜在空间建模和token匹配策略，成功解决了生成3D形状缺乏细节的问题，为3D生成领域提供了有效的细节增强解决方案。

Abstract: Modern 3D generation methods can rapidly create shapes from sparse or single
views, but their outputs often lack geometric detail due to computational
constraints. We present DetailGen3D, a generative approach specifically
designed to enhance these generated 3D shapes. Our key insight is to model the
coarse-to-fine transformation directly through data-dependent flows in latent
space, avoiding the computational overhead of large-scale 3D generative models.
We introduce a token matching strategy that ensures accurate spatial
correspondence during refinement, enabling local detail synthesis while
preserving global structure. By carefully designing our training data to match
the characteristics of synthesized coarse shapes, our method can effectively
enhance shapes produced by various 3D generation and reconstruction approaches,
from single-view to sparse multi-view inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that DetailGen3D achieves high-fidelity geometric detail synthesis while
maintaining efficiency in training.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has exhibited remarkable efficacy in novel view
synthesis (NVS). However, it suffers from a significant drawback: achieving
high-fidelity rendering typically necessitates a large number of 3D Gaussians,
resulting in substantial memory consumption and storage requirements. To
address this challenge, we propose the first knowledge distillation framework
for 3DGS, featuring various teacher models, including vanilla 3DGS,
noise-augmented variants, and dropout-regularized versions. The outputs of
these teachers are aggregated to guide the optimization of a lightweight
student model. To distill the hidden geometric structure, we propose a
structural similarity loss to boost the consistency of spatial geometric
distributions between the student and teacher model. Through comprehensive
quantitative and qualitative evaluations across diverse datasets, the proposed
Distilled-3DGS, a simple yet effective framework without bells and whistles,
achieves promising rendering results in both rendering quality and storage
efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods. Project page:

Abstract: Composed video retrieval is a challenging task that strives to retrieve a
target video based on a query video and a textual description detailing
specific modifications. Standard retrieval frameworks typically struggle to
handle the complexity of fine-grained compositional queries and variations in
temporal understanding limiting their retrieval ability in the fine-grained
setting. To address this issue, we introduce a novel dataset that captures both
fine-grained and composed actions across diverse video segments, enabling more
detailed compositional changes in retrieved video content. The proposed
dataset, named Dense-WebVid-CoVR, consists of 1.6 million samples with dense
modification text that is around seven times more than its existing
counterpart. We further develop a new model that integrates visual and textual
information through Cross-Attention (CA) fusion using grounded text encoder,
enabling precise alignment between dense query modifications and target videos.
The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results surpassing existing
methods on all metrics. Notably, it achieves 71.3\% Recall@1 in visual+text
setting and outperforms the state-of-the-art by 3.4\%, highlighting its
efficacy in terms of leveraging detailed video descriptions and dense
modification texts. Our proposed dataset, code, and model are available at

Result: 在7个合成场景的6个评估指标中，PreSem-Surf在C-L1、F-score和IoU上达到最佳性能，在NC、准确性和完整性上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: PreSem-Surf通过多信息融合和渐进式语义建模，有效提高了场景重建质量和效率，证明了其在快速高质量场景重建中的实用价值。

Abstract: This paper proposes PreSem-Surf, an optimized method based on the Neural
Radiance Field (NeRF) framework, capable of reconstructing high-quality scene

Specifically, a novel SG-MLP sampling structure combined with PR-MLP

allowing the model to capture scene-related information earlier and better
distinguish noise from local details. Furthermore, progressive semantic
modeling is adopted to extract semantic information at increasing levels of

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了IPC模拟的显著加速，同时保持了原始方法的鲁棒性和准确性，为复杂物理模拟提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a multi-level elastodynamics timestep solver for accelerating
incremental potential contact (IPC) simulations. Our method retains the
robustness of gold standard IPC in the face of intricate geometry, complex
heterogeneous material distributions and high resolution input data without
sacrificing visual fidelity (per-timestep relative displacement error of
$\approx1\%$). The success of our method is enabled by a novel, sparse,
geometry- and material-aware basis construction method which allows for the use
of fast preconditioned conjugate gradient solvers (in place of a sparse direct
solver), but without suffering convergence issues due to stiff or heterogeneous
materials. The end result is a solver that produces results visually
indistinguishable and quantitatively very close to gold-standard IPC methods
but up to $13\times$ faster on identical hardware.

Motivation: 现有基于学习的方法需要将向量数据转换为栅格图像进行处理，这个过程复杂冗余且会导致信息损失，栅格图像无法无损缩放。

Method: 提出Transformer-based条件扩散模型，在训练中集成对齐机制，使模型优化轨迹与设计师的迭代设计过程对齐，直接在向量空间处理复杂数据。

Result: 通过定量比较、定性评估、消融实验和感知研究表明，DiffPlanner在生成平面图和气泡图方面超越了现有最先进方法，提供更好的用户可控性和更接近真实结果的质量。

Conclusion: DiffPlanner框架能够更好地处理复杂向量数据，拟合预测目标的分布，完成具有挑战性的平面图布局设计任务，并实现用户可控的生成。

Abstract: The boundary-constrained floor plan generation problem aims to generate the
topological and geometric properties of a set of rooms within a given boundary.
Recently, learning-based methods have made significant progress in generating
realistic floor plans. However, these methods involve a workflow of converting
vector data into raster images, using image-based generative models, and then
converting the results back into vector data. This process is complex and
redundant, often resulting in information loss. Raster images, unlike vector
data, cannot scale without losing detail and precision. To address these
issues, we propose a novel deep learning framework called DiffPlanner for
boundary-constrained floor plan generation, which operates entirely in vector
space. Our framework is a Transformer-based conditional diffusion model that
integrates an alignment mechanism in training, aligning the optimization
trajectory of the model with the iterative design processes of designers. This
enables our model to handle complex vector data, better fit the distribution of
the predicted targets, accomplish the challenging task of floor plan layout
design, and achieve user-controllable generation. We conduct quantitative
comparisons, qualitative evaluations, ablation experiments, and perceptual
studies to evaluate our method. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
DiffPlanner surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in generating floor
plans and bubble diagrams in the creative stages, offering more controllability
to users and producing higher-quality results that closely match the ground
truths.

Result: 大量实验证明了Sketch3DVE在视频编辑方面的优越性

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了大视角变化视频的3D结构编辑挑战，实现了精确的局部操控和逼真的编辑效果

Abstract: Recent video editing methods achieve attractive results in style transfer or
appearance modification. However, editing the structural content of 3D scenes
in videos remains challenging, particularly when dealing with significant
viewpoint changes, such as large camera rotations or zooms. Key challenges
include generating novel view content that remains consistent with the original
video, preserving unedited regions, and translating sparse 2D inputs into
realistic 3D video outputs. To address these issues, we propose Sketch3DVE, a
sketch-based 3D-aware video editing method to enable detailed local
manipulation of videos with significant viewpoint changes. To solve the
challenge posed by sparse inputs, we employ image editing methods to generate
edited results for the first frame, which are then propagated to the remaining
frames of the video. We utilize sketching as an interaction tool for precise
geometry control, while other mask-based image editing methods are also
supported. To handle viewpoint changes, we perform a detailed analysis and
manipulation of the 3D information in the video. Specifically, we utilize a
dense stereo method to estimate a point cloud and the camera parameters of the
input video. We then propose a point cloud editing approach that uses depth
maps to represent the 3D geometry of newly edited components, aligning them
effectively with the original 3D scene. To seamlessly merge the newly edited
content with the original video while preserving the features of unedited
regions, we introduce a 3D-aware mask propagation strategy and employ a video
diffusion model to produce realistic edited videos. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority of Sketch3DVE in video editing. Homepage and code:

Conclusion: Is-NeRF通过显式光路建模和散射感知渲染，成功解决了NeRF在处理运动模糊图像时的局限性，为复杂光路场景提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has gained significant attention for its
prominent implicit 3D representation and realistic novel view synthesis
capabilities. Available works unexceptionally employ straight-line volume
rendering, which struggles to handle sophisticated lightpath scenarios and
introduces geometric ambiguities during training, particularly evident when
processing motion-blurred images. To address these challenges, this work
proposes a novel deblur neural radiance field, Is-NeRF, featuring explicit
lightpath modeling in real-world environments. By unifying six common light
propagation phenomena through an in-scattering representation, we establish a
new scattering-aware volume rendering pipeline adaptable to complex lightpaths.
Additionally, we introduce an adaptive learning strategy that enables
autonomous determining of scattering directions and sampling intervals to
capture finer object details. The proposed network jointly optimizes NeRF
parameters, scattering parameters, and camera motions to recover fine-grained
scene representations from blurry images. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate
that it effectively handles complex real-world scenarios, outperforming
state-of-the-art approaches in generating high-fidelity images with accurate
geometric details.

Conclusion: 研究为CSCW领域的协作和数据工作讨论做出贡献，强调了记忆机构在Wikidata上的重要数据工作，指出了支持信息专业人员贡献的机会。

Abstract: Wikidata, an open structured database and a sibling project to Wikipedia, has
recently become an important platform for information professionals to share
structured metadata from their memory institutions, organizations that maintain
public knowledge and cultural heritage materials. While studies have
investigated why and how peer producers contribute to Wikidata, the
institutional motivations and practices of these organizations are less
understood. Given Wikidata's potential role in linking and supporting knowledge
infrastructures and open data systems, we examined why and how information
professionals in memory institutions use Wikidata as part of their
organizational workflow. Through interviews with 15 participants, we identified
the three archetypal roles of Wikidata users within memory institutions,
providers, acquirers, and mutualists, and the different types of contributions
that these institutions bring to Wikidata. We then explored potential
collaboration opportunities between memory institutions and other volunteers in
Wikidata, discussed the value of the data work conducted by these
professionals, and examined how and why they track their contributions. Our
work contributes to the wider discussions around collaboration and data work in
CSCW by (1) studying the motivations and practices of information
professionals, their differences from those doing volunteer work, and
opportunities for the Wikidata community to promote more collaborative efforts
within memory institutions and with other volunteers and (2) drawing attention
to the important data work done by memory institutions on Wikidata and pointing

Motivation: 沉浸式VR提供的认知支持可能降低二进制逆向工程的认知复杂度，通过增强记忆、假设测试和视觉组织来支持逆向工程过程。

Method: 扩展先前开发的VR平台，集成LLM代理系统架构，能够查询二进制分析工具并动态生成3D可视化，然后通过试点研究评估系统性能。

Result: 试点研究表明LLM能够为小程序生成符合设计原则的有意义的3D调用图，但输出质量差异很大。

Conclusion: 这项工作提出了关于LLM作为可视化代理潜力的开放性问题，即无需明确训练就能构建反映认知设计原则的3D表示。

Abstract: Immersive virtual reality (VR) offers affordances that may reduce cognitive
complexity in binary reverse engineering (RE), enabling embodied and external
cognition to augment the RE process through enhancing memory, hypothesis
testing, and visual organization. In prior work, we applied a cognitive systems
engineering approach to identify an initial set of affordances and implemented
a VR environment to support RE through spatial persistence and interactivity.
In this work, we extend that platform with an integrated large language model
(LLM) agent capable of querying binary analysis tools, answering technical
questions, and dynamically generating immersive 3D visualizations in alignment
with analyst tasks. We describe the system architecture and our evaluation
process and results. Our pilot study shows that while LLMs can generate
meaningful 3D call graphs (for small programs) that align with design
principles, output quality varies widely. This work raises open questions about
the potential for LLMs to function as visualization agents, constructing 3D
representations that reflect cognitive design principles without explicit
training.

Motivation: 虽然先前研究关注基于对象的纹理和振动触觉反馈，但虚拟手视觉反馈对情感粗糙度感知的作用尚未充分探索。

Method: 引入情感视觉线索（线条形状、运动和颜色）应用于手部轮廓，研究其对情感反应（唤醒度、效价）和感知粗糙度的影响。

Result: 尖锐轮廓增强感知粗糙度、增加唤醒度、降低效价；颜色仅影响效价，红色持续降低情感积极性；这些效果在低触觉强度下特别明显。

Conclusion: 将表达性视觉线索与触觉反馈结合可以丰富情感渲染，为沉浸式VR交互提供灵活的情感调节能力。

Abstract: We propose a visuo-tactile feedback method that combines virtual hand
visualization and fingertip vibrations to modulate affective roughness
perception in VR. While prior work has focused on object-based textures and
vibrotactile feedback, the role of visual feedback on virtual hands remains
underexplored. Our approach introduces affective visual cues including line
shape, motion, and color applied to hand outlines, and examines their influence
on both affective responses (arousal, valence) and perceived roughness. Results
show that sharp contours enhanced perceived roughness, increased arousal, and
reduced valence, intensifying the emotional impact of haptic feedback. In
contrast, color affected valence only, with red consistently lowering emotional
positivity. These effects were especially noticeable at lower haptic
intensities, where visual cues extended affective modulation into mid-level
perceptual ranges. Overall, the findings highlight how integrating expressive
visual cues with tactile feedback can enrich affective rendering and offer
flexible emotional tuning in immersive VR interactions.

ablation study on 52 student essays comparing feedback generated with access to
only the final essay (C1) and feedback that also incorporates keylogs and

TL;DR: 本研究探讨中国社交媒体上人机恋爱关系的性质，通过分析小红书平台内容和用户访谈，发现用户对AI伴侣的自我披露能带来积极情感体验，揭示了这种关系的互惠性、自我主导性以及AI沟通中的潜在风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补人机恋爱关系研究空白，特别是在关系阶段和情感依恋背景下，探索这种新兴关系是否属于准社会关系范畴及其导航模式。

Method: 采用混合方法，分析小红书1,766条帖子和60,925条评论，并对23名参与者进行半结构化访谈，其中包括一位与自创AI建立三年关系的用户。

Result: 研究发现用户愿意向AI伴侣自我披露，带来无社会污名的积极情感；揭示了关系的互惠性和自我主导性，同时指出了AI沟通中的语言滥用、偏见和数据安全问题。

Conclusion: 人机恋爱关系呈现出独特的互惠特征和自我主导模式，虽然能带来积极情感体验，但也需要关注AI沟通中的伦理和安全问题。

Abstract: Human-AI romantic relationships have gained wide popularity among social
media users in China. The technological impact on romantic relationships and
its potential applications have long drawn research attention to topics such as
relationship preservation and negativity mitigation. Media and communication
studies also explore the practices in romantic para-social relationships.
Nonetheless, this emerging human-AI romantic relationship, whether the
relations fall into the category of para-social relationship together with its
navigation pattern, remains unexplored, particularly in the context of
relational stages and emotional attachment. This research thus seeks to fill
this gap by presenting a mixed-method approach on 1,766 posts and 60,925
comments from Xiaohongshu, as well as the semi-structured interviews with 23
participants, of whom one of them developed her relationship with self-created
AI for three years. The findings revealed that the users' willingness to
self-disclose to AI companions led to increased positivity without social
stigma. The results also unveiled the reciprocal nature of these interactions,
the dominance of 'self', and raised concerns about language misuse, bias, and
data security in AI communication.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 提出了两种混合现实对象选择技术：基于手指曲率的贝塞尔曲线选择和前臂投影的候选对象消歧机制，在密集遮挡环境中显著提高选择精度和用户体验


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决混合现实中密集或遮挡环境下传统射线投射方法存在的选择模糊性和精度降低问题

Method: 1) 实时贝塞尔曲线选择范式，通过手指曲率引导单手轨迹；2) 基于邻近映射的候选对象前臂投影消歧机制；采用2x2被试内设计实验评估

Result: 身体投影消歧显著减少选择错误和体力需求，提高感知性能、愉悦质量和用户偏好；贝塞尔输入有效访问遮挡目标但增加任务时间和努力

Conclusion: 结合曲线输入和身体预览技术可为沉浸式环境提供精确、自适应的选择支持

Abstract: Object selection in Mixed Reality (MR) becomes particularly challenging in
dense or occluded environments, where traditional mid-air ray-casting often
leads to ambiguity and reduced precision. We present two complementary
techniques: (1) a real-time Bezier Curve selection paradigm guided by finger
curvature, enabling expressive one-handed trajectories, and (2) an on-body
disambiguation mechanism that projects the four nearest candidates onto the
user's forearm via proximity-based mapping. Together, these techniques combine
flexible, user-controlled selection with tactile, proprioceptive
disambiguation. We evaluated their independent and joint effects in a 2x2
within-subjects study (N = 24), crossing interaction paradigm (Bezier Curve vs.
Linear Ray) with interaction medium (Mid-air vs. On-body). Results show that
on-body disambiguation significantly reduced selection errors and physical
demand while improving perceived performance, hedonic quality, and user
preference. Bezier input provided effective access to occluded targets but
incurred longer task times and greater effort under some conditions. We
conclude with design implications for integrating curved input and on-body
previews to support precise, adaptive selection in immersive environments.

Result: 识别了关键机遇和挑战，提出了连接心智与运动以模拟交互用户行为的可行后续步骤。

Conclusion: 具身用户模拟是HCI的下一个前沿，能够更准确地预测交互行为，为界面设计和系统测试提供有力工具。

Abstract: Computational models of how users perceive and act within a virtual or
physical environment offer enormous potential for the understanding and design
of user interactions. Cognition models have been used to understand the role of
attention and individual preferences and beliefs on human decision making
during interaction, while biomechanical simulations have been successfully
applied to analyse and predict physical effort, fatigue, and discomfort. The
next frontier in HCI lies in connecting these models to enable robust, diverse,
and representative simulations of different user groups. These embodied user
simulations could predict user intents, strategies, and movements during
interaction more accurately, benchmark interfaces and interaction techniques in
terms of performance and ergonomics, and guide adaptive system design. This
UIST workshop explores ideas for integrating computational models into HCI and
discusses use cases such as UI/UX design, automated system testing, and
personalised adaptive interfaces. It brings researchers from relevant
disciplines together to identify key opportunities and challenges as well as
feasible next steps for bridging mind and motion to simulate interactive user
behaviour.

Motivation: 传统OSCE考试需要涉及专业演员和医学专家的大量资源，而现有的文本基于LLM的虚拟患者缺乏丰富的非文本交互能力。

Method: 设计了一种新框架，为LLM基于模拟患者添加了动作空间，支持更现实的患者行为，并集成虚拟教练系统提供实时个性化反馈。

Result: 进行了严格的实时性能评估，包括系统延迟和组件准确性。预初评估显示模拟患者具有自然性和连贯性，虚拟教练的评估也被认为有用且适当。

Conclusion: 这个创新系统为医学生提供了一个低成本、易获取的个性化OSCE准备平台，有效解决了传统方法的资源刻刻问题。

Abstract: Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs) are essential for medical
training, but they require significant resources, including professional actors
and expert medical feedback. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have
introduced text-based virtual patients for communication practice, these
simulations often lack the capability for richer, non-textual interactions.
This paper presents a novel framework that significantly enhances LLM-based
simulated patients by equipping them with action spaces, thereby enabling more
realistic and dynamic patient behaviors that extend beyond text. Furthermore,
our system incorporates virtual tutors that provide students with instant,
personalized feedback on their performance at any time during these simulated
encounters. We have conducted a rigorous evaluation of the framework's
real-time performance, including system latency and component accuracy.
Preliminary evaluations with medical experts assessed the naturalness and
coherence of the simulated patients, as well as the usefulness and
appropriateness of the virtual tutor's assessments. This innovative system
provides medical students with a low-cost, accessible platform for personalized
OSCE preparation at home.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM提示工程面临结构组织困难、多数据类型整合不足、格式敏感以及工具支持缺乏等挑战，需要系统化解决方案。

Method: 采用基于组件的标记语言设计，包含逻辑结构组件、专用数据集成标签、CSS样式系统分离内容与呈现，并提供动态模板和完整开发工具链。

Result: 通过案例研究验证了POML在复杂应用集成(PomLink)和准确性性能(TableQA)方面的效果，用户研究证实了其在真实开发场景中的有效性。

Conclusion: POML为LLM提示工程提供了系统化的解决方案，显著改善了提示的组织结构、数据集成能力和开发效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require sophisticated prompting, yet current
practices face challenges in structure, data integration, format sensitivity,
and tooling. Existing methods lack comprehensive solutions for organizing
complex prompts involving diverse data types (documents, tables, images) or
managing presentation variations systematically. To address these gaps, we
introduce POML (Prompt Orchestration Markup Language). POML employs
component-based markup for logical structure (roles, tasks, examples),
specialized tags for seamless data integration, and a CSS-like styling system
to decouple content from presentation, reducing formatting sensitivity. It
includes templating for dynamic prompts and a comprehensive developer toolkit
(IDE support, SDKs) to improve version control and collaboration. We validate
POML through two case studies demonstrating its impact on complex application
integration (PomLink) and accuracy performance (TableQA), as well as a user
study assessing its effectiveness in real-world development scenarios.

Method: 设计基于大语言模型的提示素养教学模块，包含基于场景的刻意练习活动，让学生直接与智能LLM代理交互，在11个真实中学课堂进行两轮部署评估

Result: AI自动评分器能满意地评分学生编写的提示；教学材料支持学生通过练习提升提示技能，并对其使用AI学习的认知产生积极转变；判断题和开放式问题比选择题能更有效测量提示素养

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integrated into daily
life, there is a growing need to equip the next generation with the ability to
apply, interact with, evaluate, and collaborate with AI systems responsibly.
Prior research highlights the urgent demand from K-12 educators to teach
students the ethical and effective use of AI for learning. To address this
need, we designed an Large-Language Model (LLM)-based module to teach prompting
literacy. This includes scenario-based deliberate practice activities with
direct interaction with intelligent LLM agents, aiming to foster secondary
school students' responsible engagement with AI chatbots. We conducted two
iterations of classroom deployment in 11 authentic secondary education
classrooms, and evaluated 1) AI-based auto-grader's capability; 2) students'
prompting performance and confidence changes towards using AI for learning; and
3) the quality of learning and assessment materials. Results indicated that the
AI-based auto-grader could grade student-written prompts with satisfactory
quality. In addition, the instructional materials supported students in
improving their prompting skills through practice and led to positive shifts in
their perceptions of using AI for learning. Furthermore, data from Study 1
informed assessment revisions in Study 2. Analyses of item difficulty and
discrimination in Study 2 showed that True/False and open-ended questions could
measure prompting literacy more effectively than multiple-choice questions for
our target learners. These promising outcomes highlight the potential for
broader deployment and highlight the need for broader studies to assess
learning effectiveness and assessment design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图表视觉问答这一自然语言理解中的子任务，探索跨模态信息交换在图表理解中的应用。

Method: 开发基于VisualBERT的BERT-VQA模型，使用预训练的ResNet 101图像编码器，可能加入联合融合机制，与包含LSTM、CNN和浅层分类器的基线模型进行比较。

Result: 最终结果推翻了核心假设，证明VisualBERT中的跨模态模块在图表组件与问题短语对齐方面并不关键，模型表现不如预期。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了图表问答任务的难度，并提供了关于不同模型架构在解决此类问题适用性的宝贵见解。

Abstract: Visual question answering has been an exciting challenge in the field of
natural language understanding, as it requires deep learning models to exchange
information from both vision and language domains. In this project, we aim to
tackle a subtask of this problem, namely visual question answering on plots. To
achieve this, we developed BERT-VQA, a VisualBERT-based model architecture with
a pretrained ResNet 101 image encoder, along with a potential addition of joint
fusion. We trained and evaluated this model against a baseline that consisted
of a LSTM, a CNN, and a shallow classifier. The final outcome disproved our
core hypothesis that the cross-modality module in VisualBERT is essential in
aligning plot components with question phrases. Therefore, our work provided
valuable insights into the difficulty of the plot question answering challenge
as well as the appropriateness of different model architectures in solving this
problem.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach for multimodal sentiment analysis on
social media, particularly in the context of natural disasters, where
understanding public sentiment is crucial for effective crisis management.
Unlike conventional methods that process text and image modalities separately,
our approach seamlessly integrates Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based
image analysis with Large Language Model (LLM) based text processing,
leveraging Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) and prompt engineering to
extract sentiment relevant features from the CrisisMMD dataset. To effectively
model intermodal relationships, we introduce a contextual attention mechanism
within the fusion process. Leveraging contextual-attention layers, this
mechanism effectively captures intermodality interactions, enhancing the
model's comprehension of complex relationships between textual and visual data.
The deep neural network architecture of our model learns from these fused
features, leading to improved accuracy compared to existing baselines.
Experimental results demonstrate significant advancements in classifying social
media data into informative and noninformative categories across various
natural disasters. Our model achieves a notable 2.43% increase in accuracy and
5.18% in F1-score, highlighting its efficacy in processing complex multimodal
data. Beyond quantitative metrics, our approach provides deeper insight into
the sentiments expressed during crises. The practical implications extend to
real time disaster management, where enhanced sentiment analysis can optimize
the accuracy of emergency interventions. By bridging the gap between multimodal
analysis, LLM powered text understanding, and disaster response, our work
presents a promising direction for Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven crisis
management solutions. Keywords:

Motivation: 物理信息神经网络作为求解微分方程的新兴方法，其性能受多种因素影响，但训练点分布这一核心组件尚未得到系统研究。

Method: 使用两个常微分方程和两个偏微分方程，测试五种训练点生成策略（包括新提出的基于正弦的分布），采用浅层网络架构（1-2个隐藏层），并考虑随机和固定种子权重初始化以确保可重复性。

Result: 研究结果显示训练点分布对解精度有显著影响，并发现分布策略与微分方程的特性存在关联。

Conclusion: 训练点分布是影响PINNs性能的关键因素，需要根据具体微分方程特性选择合适的分布策略，基于正弦的分布方法显示出潜力。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks approach the approximation of differential
equations by directly incorporating their structure and given conditions in a
loss function. This enables conditions like, e.g., invariants to be easily
added during the modelling phase. In addition, the approach can be considered
as mesh free and can be utilised to compute solutions on arbitrary grids after
the training phase. Therefore, physics-informed neural networks are emerging as
a promising alternative to solving differential equations with methods from
numerical mathematics. However, their performance highly depends on a large
variety of factors. In this paper, we systematically investigate and evaluate a
core component of the approach, namely the training point distribution. We test
two ordinary and two partial differential equations with five strategies for
training data generation and shallow network architectures, with one and two
hidden layers. In addition to common distributions, we introduce sine-based
training points, which are motivated by the construction of Chebyshev nodes.
The results are challenged by using certain parameter combinations like, e.g.,
random and fixed-seed weight initialisation for reproducibility. The results
show the impact of the training point distributions on the solution accuracy
and we find evidence that they are connected to the characteristics of the
differential equation.

Motivation: 现有的时序交互网络学习忽略了网络拓扑结构的影响，将其视为粗粒度的多序列预测问题，存在局限性

Method: DGNPP模型包含节点聚合层（捕获拓扑结构生成静态表示）和自注意力层（动态更新嵌入），将动态和静态嵌入结合到事件强度函数中，通过最大似然估计优化

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验表明，DGNPP在事件预测和时间预测任务上实现了优越性能，显著优于基线模型，且效率高

Conclusion: DGNPP有效解决了先前方法的局限性，通过同时考虑网络拓扑和时序动态性，在时序交互网络学习中取得了突破性进展

Abstract: Learning temporal interaction networks(TIN) is previously regarded as a
coarse-grained multi-sequence prediction problem, ignoring the network topology
structure influence. This paper addresses this limitation and a Deep Graph
Neural Point Process(DGNPP) model for TIN is proposed. DGNPP consists of two
key modules: the Node Aggregation Layer and the Self Attentive Layer. The Node
Aggregation Layer captures topological structures to generate static
representation for users and items, while the Self Attentive Layer dynamically
updates embeddings over time. By incorporating both dynamic and static
embeddings into the event intensity function and optimizing the model via
maximum likelihood estimation, DGNPP predicts events and occurrence time
effectively. Experimental evaluations on three public datasets demonstrate that
DGNPP achieves superior performance in event prediction and time prediction
tasks with high efficiency, significantly outperforming baseline models and
effectively mitigating the limitations of prior approaches.

Conclusion: 该元学习方法能有效加速AutoML过程，显著减少计算成本和搜索空间，为自动化机器学习提供了更高效的优化策略。

Abstract: Automated machine learning (AutoML) has democratized the design of machine
learning based systems, by automating model selection, hyperparameter tuning
and feature engineering. However, the high computational cost associated with
traditional search and optimization strategies, such as Random Search, Particle
Swarm Optimization and Bayesian Optimization, remains a significant challenge.
Moreover, AutoML systems typically explore a large search space, which can lead
to overfitting. This paper introduces a metalearning method for dynamically
designing search spaces for AutoML system. The proposed method uses historical
metaknowledge to select promising regions of the search space, accelerating the
optimization process. According to experiments conducted for this study, the
proposed method can reduce runtime by 89\% in Random Search and search space by
(1.8/13 preprocessor and 4.3/16 classifier), without compromising significant
predictive performance. Moreover, the proposed method showed competitive
performance when adapted to Auto-Sklearn, reducing its search space.
Furthermore, this study encompasses insights into meta-feature selection,
meta-model explainability, and the trade-offs inherent in search space
reduction strategies.

TL;DR: RISE是一个两阶段框架，通过强化学习生成视觉基础、逻辑一致的思维链，然后利用高质量CoT子集进行监督和强化微调，提升VLM在复杂图像标注任务中的推理能力和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在复杂图像标注任务（如情感分类和上下文驱动的目标检测）中存在推理能力不足的问题。标准监督微调只关注标注结果而忽略推理过程，而视觉强化微调由于缺乏高质量的验证思维链导致推理不一致。

Method: RISE框架包含两个阶段：1) Reason阶段（RISE-CoT）：通过强化学习的"标注-推理-标注"闭环生成视觉基础、逻辑一致的思维链；2) Inspire和Strengthen阶段（RISE-R1）：利用RISE-CoT奖励筛选的高质量CoT子集进行监督微调，然后进行强化微调。

Result: 在复杂和简单图像标注任务上评估，RISE训练的Qwen2-VL-2B模型在性能和可解释性方面均优于SFT和Visual-RFT方法，实现了稳健的性能和增强的可解释性。

Conclusion: RISE提供了一种无需人工标注思维链的自监督解决方案，能够有效提升视觉语言模型的推理能力，在复杂视觉任务中实现专业水平的性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with complex image annotation tasks,
such as emotion classification and context-driven object detection, which
demand sophisticated reasoning. Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) focuses
solely on annotation outcomes, ignoring underlying rationales, while Visual
Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (Visual-RFT) produces inconsistent Chains of Thought
(CoTs) due to the absence of high-quality, verified CoTs during pre-training.
We introduce RISE (Reason-Inspire-Strengthen-Expertise), a two-stage framework
to overcome these limitations. In the Reason stage (RISE-CoT), a reinforcement
learning-driven "annotation-reasoning-annotation" closed-loop generates
visually grounded, logically consistent CoTs by verifying their ability to
reconstruct original annotations without direct leakage. The Inspire and
Strengthen stage (RISE-R1) leverages a high-quality CoT subset, filtered by
RISE-CoT rewards, for supervised fine-tuning, followed by reinforcement
fine-tuning to produce interpretable reasoning and accurate annotations,
achieving Expertise in complex visual tasks. Evaluated on complex and simple
image annotation tasks, RISE-trained Qwen2-VL-2B outperforms SFT and
Visual-RFT, achieving robust performance and enhanced explainability. RISE
offers a self-supervised solution for advancing VLM reasoning without requiring
manually annotated CoTs.

Abstract: Discovering the governing equations of a physical system and designing an
effective feedback controller remains one of the most challenging and intensive
areas of ongoing research. This task demands a deep understanding of the system
behavior, including the nonlinear factors that influence its dynamics. In this
article, we propose a novel methodology for identifying a feedback linearized
physical system based on known prior dynamic behavior. Initially, the system is
identified using a sparse regression algorithm, subsequently a feedback
controller is designed for the discovered system by applying Lie derivatives to
the dictionary of output functions to derive an augmented constraint which
guarantees that no internal dynamics are observed. Unlike the prior related
works, the novel aspect of this article combines the approach of stacked
regression algorithm and relative degree conditions to discover and feedback
linearize the true governing equations of a physical model.

Abstract: Communication is essential for the collective execution of complex tasks by
human agents, motivating interest in communication mechanisms for multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). However, existing communication protocols in
MARL are often complex and non-differentiable. In this work, we introduce a
self-attention-based communication module that exchanges information between
the agents in MARL. Our proposed approach is fully differentiable, allowing
agents to learn to generate messages in a reward-driven manner. The module can
be seamlessly integrated with any action-value function decomposition method
and can be viewed as an extension of such decompositions. Notably, it includes
a fixed number of trainable parameters, independent of the number of agents.
Experimental results on the SMAC benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our

*Nobuyuki Oishi,Philip Birch,Daniel Roggen,Paula Lago*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了基于物理模拟的物理合理数据增强（PPDA）方法，相比传统的信号变换数据增强（STDA）在传感器人体活动识别中表现更优，平均提升3.7个百分点的宏F1分数，并能用少60%的训练数据达到竞争性性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传感器人体活动识别（HAR）中高质量标注数据的稀缺限制了模型性能和在现实场景中的泛化能力。传统信号变换数据增强方法往往物理不合理，可能导致增强数据无法保持活动标签的原始含义。

Method: 利用物理模拟技术，通过运动捕捉或视频姿态估计获取人体运动数据，并引入包括身体运动修改、传感器位置变化和硬件相关效应等多种现实变异性，实现物理合理的数据增强。

Result: 在三个日常活动和健身锻炼的公开数据集上，PPDA相比STDA平均提升宏F1分数3.7个百分点（最高13个百分点），且使用少60%的训练主体就能达到竞争性性能。

Conclusion: 物理合理数据增强在传感器HAR中具有显著优势，物理模拟为生成合成惯性测量单元数据提供了成本效益高且可扩展的解决方案，有助于解决HAR中的标注稀缺挑战。

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality labeled data in sensor-based Human Activity
Recognition (HAR) hinders model performance and limits generalization across
real-world scenarios. Data augmentation is a key strategy to mitigate this
issue by enhancing the diversity of training datasets. Signal
Transformation-based Data Augmentation (STDA) techniques have been widely used
in HAR. However, these methods are often physically implausible, potentially
resulting in augmented data that fails to preserve the original meaning of the
activity labels. In this study, we introduce and systematically characterize
Physically Plausible Data Augmentation (PPDA) enabled by physics simulation.
PPDA leverages human body movement data from motion capture or video-based pose
estimation and incorporates various realistic variabilities through physics
simulation, including modifying body movements, sensor placements, and
hardware-related effects. We compare the performance of PPDAs with traditional
STDAs on three public datasets of daily activities and fitness workouts. First,
we evaluate each augmentation method individually, directly comparing PPDAs to
their STDA counterparts. Next, we assess how combining multiple PPDAs can
reduce the need for initial data collection by varying the number of subjects
used for training. Experiments show consistent benefits of PPDAs, improving
macro F1 scores by an average of 3.7 pp (up to 13 pp) and achieving competitive
performance with up to 60% fewer training subjects than STDAs. As the first
systematic study of PPDA in sensor-based HAR, these results highlight the
advantages of pursuing physical plausibility in data augmentation and the
potential of physics simulation for generating synthetic Inertial Measurement
Unit data for training deep learning HAR models. This cost-effective and
scalable approach therefore helps address the annotation scarcity challenge in
HAR.

Motivation: 现有数据驱动的算法匹配系统无法实现人机互补性，人类使用算法系统做出的决策不一定比单独使用人类或算法更好

Method: 提出协作匹配(comatch)系统，算法只选择最有信心的匹配决策进行处理，其余决策推迟给人类决策者，优化决策分配以最大化性能

Conclusion: 协作匹配方法能够有效实现人机互补性，在匹配任务中显著提升决策质量

Abstract: Data-driven algorithmic matching systems promise to help human decision
makers make better matching decisions in a wide variety of high-stakes
application domains, such as healthcare and social service provision. However,
existing systems are not designed to achieve human-AI complementarity:
decisions made by a human using an algorithmic matching system are not
necessarily better than those made by the human or by the algorithm alone. Our
work aims to address this gap. To this end, we propose collaborative matching
(comatch), a data-driven algorithmic matching system that takes a collaborative
approach: rather than making all the matching decisions for a matching task
like existing systems, it selects only the decisions that it is the most
confident in, deferring the rest to the human decision maker. In the process,
comatch optimizes how many decisions it makes and how many it defers to the
human decision maker to provably maximize performance. We conduct a large-scale
human subject study with $800$ participants to validate the proposed approach.
The results demonstrate that the matching outcomes produced by comatch
outperform those generated by either human participants or by algorithmic
matching on their own. The data gathered in our human subject study and an
implementation of our system are available as open source at
https://github.com/Networks-Learning/human-AI-complementarity-matching.

TL;DR: 本文提出了分层保形分类（HCC），将类别层次结构融入保形预测框架，在保持覆盖率保证的同时生成包含不同层次节点的预测集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准保形预测将类别视为平面且无结构的，忽略了类别标签之间的语义关系或层次结构等领域知识。

Method: 将HCC表述为约束优化问题，通过证明一个更小的、结构良好的候选解子集足以确保覆盖率和最优性，解决了问题的组合性质。

Result: 在音频、图像和文本数据三个新基准上的实证评估显示了方法的优势，用户研究表明注释者显著偏好分层预测集而非平面预测集。

Conclusion: HCC成功地将类别层次结构融入保形预测，在保持统计保证的同时提供了更具信息量和用户友好的预测集。

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is a powerful framework for quantifying uncertainty
in machine learning models, offering reliable predictions with finite-sample
coverage guarantees. When applied to classification, CP produces a prediction
set of possible labels that is guaranteed to contain the true label with high
probability, regardless of the underlying classifier. However, standard CP
treats classes as flat and unstructured, ignoring domain knowledge such as
semantic relationships or hierarchical structure among class labels. This paper
presents hierarchical conformal classification (HCC), an extension of CP that
incorporates class hierarchies into both the structure and semantics of
prediction sets. We formulate HCC as a constrained optimization problem whose
solutions yield prediction sets composed of nodes at different levels of the
hierarchy, while maintaining coverage guarantees. To address the combinatorial
nature of the problem, we formally show that a much smaller, well-structured
subset of candidate solutions suffices to ensure coverage while upholding
optimality. An empirical evaluation on three new benchmarks consisting of
audio, image, and text data highlights the advantages of our approach, and a
user study shows that annotators significantly prefer hierarchical over flat
prediction sets.

Method: 对于可微距离函数约束，在FM目标中添加惩罚项；对于成员查询约束，采用随机化学习均值流的方法，并提出两阶段计算高效策略。

Result: 数值实验显示，所提方法在约束满足率方面取得显著提升，同时保持目标分布匹配性能，并成功应用于对抗样本生成任务。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了约束Flow Matching生成问题，为硬标签黑盒分类器等实际应用提供了可行方案，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: We consider the problem of generating samples via Flow Matching (FM) with an
additional requirement that the generated samples must satisfy given
constraints. We consider two scenarios, viz.: (a) when a differentiable
distance function to the constraint set is given, and (b) when the constraint
set is only available via queries to a membership oracle. For case (a), we
propose a simple adaptation of the FM objective with an additional term that
penalizes the distance between the constraint set and the generated samples.
For case (b), we propose to employ randomization and learn a mean flow that is
numerically shown to have a high likelihood of satisfying the constraints. This
approach deviates significantly from existing works that require simple convex
constraints, knowledge of a barrier function, or a reflection mechanism to
constrain the probability flow. Furthermore, in the proposed setting we show
that a two-stage approach, where both stages approximate the same original flow
but with only the second stage probing the constraints via randomization, is
more computationally efficient. Through several synthetic cases of constrained
generation, we numerically show that the proposed approaches achieve
significant gains in terms of constraint satisfaction while matching the target
distributions. As a showcase for a practical oracle-based constraint, we show
how our approach can be used for training an adversarial example generator,
using queries to a hard-label black-box classifier. We conclude with several
future research directions. Our code is available at

Motivation: 传统机器语言习得假设学习者能够观察到所有相关信息，但现实中存在部分可观测性，即学习者需要从环境、行动和发送的消息中推断相关信息。

Method: 提出了一个基于学习的算法，通过推断私有信息来解码语言映射关系，在玩具设置中演示了解决方案，并正式探讨了更一般设置中的挑战。

Result: 展示了在部分可观测环境下语言习得问题的可行性解决方案，证明了通过环境知识和行动信息可以推断出私有信息。

Conclusion: 部分可观测性是语言习得中一个重要但常被忽视的方面，提出的学习算法能够有效处理这种挑战，为更现实的机器语言学习场景提供了理论基础和方法支持。

Abstract: Machine language acquisition is often presented as a problem of imitation
learning: there exists a community of language users from which a learner
observes speech acts and attempts to decode the mappings between utterances and
situations. However, an interesting consideration that is typically unaddressed
is partial observability, i.e. the learner is assumed to see all relevant
information. This paper explores relaxing this assumption, thereby posing a
more challenging setting where such information needs to be inferred from
knowledge of the environment, the actions taken, and messages sent. We see
several motivating examples of this problem, demonstrate how they can be solved
in a toy setting, and formally explore challenges that arise in more general
settings. A learning-based algorithm is then presented to perform the decoding
of private information to facilitate language acquisition.

Abstract: Predicting particle trajectories with neural networks (NNs) has substantially
enhanced many scientific and engineering domains. However, effectively
quantifying and visualizing the inherent uncertainty in predictions remains
challenging. Without an understanding of the uncertainty, the reliability of NN
models in applications where trustworthiness is paramount is significantly
compromised. This paper introduces the uncertainty tube, a novel,
computationally efficient visualization method designed to represent this
uncertainty in NN-derived particle paths. Our key innovation is the design and
implementation of a superelliptical tube that accurately captures and
intuitively conveys nonsymmetric uncertainty. By integrating well-established
uncertainty quantification techniques, such as Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo
Dropout (MC Dropout), and Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian (SWAG), we
demonstrate the practical utility of the uncertainty tube, showcasing its
application on both synthetic and simulation datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于动态图构建和时空注意力机制的fMRI分类新框架，用于自闭症谱系障碍诊断，在ABIDE数据集上取得了63.2%的准确率和60.0%的AUC，优于静态图方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有fMRI分类方法大多基于静态功能连接或无法全面捕捉时空关系，需要开发能够动态建模脑功能连接时空特性的新方法。

Method: 使用基于transformer的注意力机制动态推断每个时间间隔的脑功能连接，构建时变图，然后通过图卷积网络和transformer处理，捕捉局部交互和全局时间依赖关系。

Result: 在ABIDE数据集子集上，模型达到63.2%准确率和60.0% AUC，显著优于静态图卷积网络方法（51.8%）。

Conclusion: 验证了动态连接和时空上下文联合建模对fMRI分类的有效性，核心创新在于注意力驱动的动态图创建和GCN-transformer融合的层次时空特征融合。

Abstract: Understanding the complex neural activity dynamics is crucial for the
development of the field of neuroscience. Although current functional MRI
classification approaches tend to be based on static functional connectivity or
cannot capture spatio-temporal relationships comprehensively, we present a new
framework that leverages dynamic graph creation and spatiotemporal attention
mechanisms for Autism Spectrum Disorder(ASD) diagnosis. The approach used in
this research dynamically infers functional brain connectivity in each time
interval using transformer-based attention mechanisms, enabling the model to
selectively focus on crucial brain regions and time segments. By constructing
time-varying graphs that are then processed with Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCNs) and transformers, our method successfully captures both localized
interactions and global temporal dependencies. Evaluated on the subset of ABIDE
dataset, our model achieves 63.2 accuracy and 60.0 AUC, outperforming static
graph-based approaches (e.g., GCN:51.8). This validates the efficacy of joint
modeling of dynamic connectivity and spatio-temporal context for fMRI
classification. The core novelty arises from (1) attention-driven dynamic graph
creation that learns temporal brain region interactions and (2) hierarchical
spatio-temporal feature fusion through GCNtransformer fusion.

Motivation: 现有的MoE训练系统主要针对NVIDIA GPU优化，在非NVIDIA平台上性能不佳，且存在显著的激活内存开销和昂贵的all-to-all通信问题，限制了MoE架构的可扩展性。

Method: 采用高效的免填充MoE训练与跨平台内核、冗余绕过调度以及序列分片MoE块的混合并行技术。

Result: 在Frontier超级计算机（AMD MI250X GPU）上，X-MoE成功将DeepSeek风格的MoE扩展到5450亿参数，在1024个GPU上训练，比现有方法在相同硬件预算下可训练的模型大10倍，同时保持高训练吞吐量。

Conclusion: X-MoE系统有效解决了MoE训练在非NVIDIA平台上的性能瓶颈，显著提升了模型规模和训练效率，为下一代MoE架构的规模化训练提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Emerging expert-specialized Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, such as
DeepSeek-MoE, deliver strong model quality through fine-grained expert
segmentation and large top-k routing. However, their scalability is limited by
substantial activation memory overhead and costly all-to-all communication.
Furthermore, current MoE training systems - primarily optimized for NVIDIA GPUs
- perform suboptimally on non-NVIDIA platforms, leaving significant
computational potential untapped. In this work, we present X-MoE, a novel MoE
training system designed to deliver scalable training performance for
next-generation MoE architectures. X-MoE achieves this via several novel
techniques, including efficient padding-free MoE training with cross-platform
kernels, redundancy-bypassing dispatch, and hybrid parallelism with
sequence-sharded MoE blocks. Our evaluation on the Frontier supercomputer,
powered by AMD MI250X GPUs, shows that X-MoE scales DeepSeek-style MoEs up to
545 billion parameters across 1024 GPUs - 10x larger than the largest trainable
model with existing methods under the same hardware budget, while maintaining
high training throughput. The source code of X-MoE is available at

Abstract: Predicting counterfactual distributions in complex dynamical systems is
essential for scientific modeling and decision-making in domains such as public
health and medicine. However, existing methods often rely on point estimates or
purely data-driven models, which tend to falter under data scarcity. We propose
a time series diffusion-based framework that incorporates guidance from
imperfect expert models by extracting high-level signals to serve as structured
priors for generative modeling. Our method, ODE-Diff, bridges mechanistic and
data-driven approaches, enabling more reliable and interpretable causal
inference. We evaluate ODE-Diff across semi-synthetic COVID-19 simulations,
synthetic pharmacological dynamics, and real-world case studies, demonstrating
that it consistently outperforms strong baselines in both point prediction and
distributional accuracy.

Motivation: 随着可再生能源在电网中渗透率增加，需要建筑群的协调需求灵活性。现有测试平台多为单建筑，多建筑平台有限且依赖简化模型，无法充分捕捉物理细节和中间变量，限制了控制策略的基准测试。

Conclusion: MuFlex平台为多建筑灵活性协调控制提供了可扩展的标准化测试环境，证明了建筑群协调控制的有效性。

Abstract: With the increasing penetration of renewable generation on the power grid,
maintaining system balance requires coordinated demand flexibility from
aggregations of buildings. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely explored
for building controls because of its model-free nature. Open-source simulation
testbeds are essential not only for training RL agents but also for fairly
benchmarking control strategies. However, most building-sector testbeds target
single buildings; multi-building platforms are relatively limited and typically
rely on simplified models (e.g., Resistance-Capacitance) or data-driven
approaches, which lack the ability to fully capture the physical intricacies
and intermediate variables necessary for interpreting control performance.
Moreover, these platforms often impose fixed inputs, outputs, and model
formats, restricting their applicability as benchmarking tools across diverse
control scenarios. To address these gaps, MuFlex, a scalable, open-source
platform for benchmarking and testing control strategies for multi-building
flexibility coordination, was developed in this study. MuFlex enables
synchronous information exchange across EnergyPlus building models and adheres
to the latest OpenAI Gym interface, providing a modular, standardized RL
implementation. The platform capabilities were demonstrated in a case study
coordinating demand flexibility across four office buildings using the Soft
Actor-Critic algorithm with carefully fine-tuned hyperparameters. The results
show that aggregating the four buildings flexibility reduced total peak demand
below a specified threshold while maintaining indoor environmental quality.

Abstract: Future trajectories play an important role across domains such as autonomous
driving, hurricane forecasting, and epidemic modeling, where practitioners
commonly generate ensemble paths by sampling probabilistic models or leveraging
multiple autoregressive predictors. While these trajectories reflect inherent
uncertainty, they are typically uncalibrated. We propose a unified framework
based on conformal prediction that transforms sampled trajectories into
calibrated prediction intervals with theoretical coverage guarantees. By
introducing a novel online update step and an optimization step that captures
inter-step dependencies, our method can produce discontinuous prediction
intervals around each trajectory, naturally capture temporal dependencies, and
yield sharper, more adaptive uncertainty estimates.

Abstract: The growing demand for intelligent services on resource-constrained edge
devices has spurred the development of collaborative inference systems that
distribute workloads across end devices, edge servers, and the cloud. While
most existing frameworks focus on single-task, single-model scenarios, many
real-world applications (e.g., autonomous driving and augmented reality)
require concurrent execution of diverse tasks including detection,
segmentation, and depth estimation. In this work, we propose a unified
framework to jointly decide which multi-task models to deploy (onload) at
clients and edge servers, and how to route queries across the hierarchy
(offload) to maximize overall inference accuracy under memory, compute, and
communication constraints. We formulate this as a mixed-integer program and
introduce J3O (Joint Optimization of Onloading and Offloading), an alternating
algorithm that (i) greedily selects models to onload via Lagrangian-relaxed
submodular optimization and (ii) determines optimal offloading via constrained
linear programming. We further extend J3O to account for batching at the edge,
maintaining scalability under heterogeneous task loads. Experiments show J3O
consistently achieves over $97\%$ of the optimal accuracy while incurring less
than $15\%$ of the runtime required by the optimal solver across multi-task
benchmarks.

TL;DR: 基于时间频率分析中chirp事件的统计异常通道与临床定义的癫痫发作起始区(SOZ)空间一致性评估框架，通过LOF异常检测和加权空间相关性分析，在手术成功患者中表现出高精度的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个定量评估框架，通过分析chirp事件的统计异常通道来验证其与临床SOZ的空间一致性，为癫痫手术定位提供补充方法。

Method: 两步法：1) 使用局部异常因子(LOF)进行无监督异常检测，基于chirp事件的频谱时间特征；2) 空间相关性分析，计算精确匹配和加权索引相似性，考虑半球一致性和电极邻近性。

Result: LOF方法(N=20, contamination=0.2)有效检测异常通道，加权索引匹配优于精确匹配。手术成功患者表现最佳(索引精度均值0.865)，无发作患者最高(0.903)，失败病例一致性较低(0.460)。

Conclusion: 基于chirp的异常检测结合加权空间指标为SOZ定位提供了有效的补充方法，特别适用于手术成功的患者病例。

Abstract: This study presents a quantitative framework for evaluating the spatial
concordance between clinically defined seizure onset zones (SOZs) and
statistically anomalous channels identified through time-frequency analysis of
chirp events. The proposed pipeline employs a two-step methodology: (1)
Unsupervised Outlier Detection, where Local Outlier Factor (LOF) analysis with
adaptive neighborhood selection identifies anomalous channels based on
spectro-temporal features of chirp (Onset frequency, offset frequency, and
temporal duration); and (2) Spatial Correlation Analysis, which computes both
exact co-occurrence metrics and weighted index similarity, incorporating
hemispheric congruence and electrode proximity. Key findings demonstrate that
the LOF-based approach (N neighbors=20, contamination=0.2) effectively detects
outliers, with index matching (weighted by channel proximity) outperforming
exact matching in SOZ localization. Performance metrics (precision, recall, F1)
were highest for seizure-free patients (Index Precision mean: 0.903) and those
with successful surgical outcomes (Index Precision mean: 0.865), whereas
failure cases exhibited lower concordance (Index Precision mean: 0.460). The
key takeaway is that chirp-based outlier detection, combined with weighted
spatial metrics, provides a complementary method for SOZ localization,
particularly in patients with successful surgical outcomes.

Abstract: Designing de-novo molecules with desired property profiles requires efficient
exploration of the vast chemical space ranging from $10^{23}$ to $10^{60}$
possible synthesizable candidates. While various deep generative models have
been developed to design small molecules using diverse input representations,
Molecular Large Language Models (Mol-LLMs) based on string representations have
emerged as a scalable approach capable of exploring billions of molecules.
However, there remains limited understanding regarding how standard language
modeling practices such as textual representations, tokenization strategies,
model size, and dataset scale impact molecular generation performance. In this
work, we systematically investigate these critical aspects by introducing
NovoMolGen, a family of transformer-based foundation models pretrained on 1.5
billion molecules for de-novo molecule generation. Through extensive empirical
analyses, we identify a weak correlation between performance metrics measured
during pretraining and actual downstream performance, revealing important
distinctions between molecular and general NLP training dynamics. NovoMolGen
establishes new state-of-the-art results, substantially outperforming prior
Mol-LLMs and specialized generative models in both unconstrained and
goal-directed molecular generation tasks, thus providing a robust foundation
for advancing efficient and effective molecular modeling strategies.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了两种网络感知的UCB算法(NetLinUCB和Net-SGD-UCB)，用于解决网络环境中的上下文线性老虎机问题，通过自适应信息共享机制实现全局和局部学习的分解，显著降低了通信成本和学习复杂度。

Result: 算法将共享结构相关的学习复杂度从O(N)降低到次线性O(√N)，NetLinUCB在低噪声细粒度异质性场景表现优异，Net-SGD-UCB在高维高方差上下文环境中更稳健。在模拟定价环境中相比标准基准方法表现更有效。

Conclusion: 提出的网络感知算法成功解决了部分信息共享的网络环境学习问题，通过自适应信息共享机制实现了通信成本和学习复杂度的显著降低，为网络化决策问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We consider contextual linear bandits over networks, a class of sequential
decision-making problems where learning occurs simultaneously across multiple
locations and the reward distributions share structural similarities while also
exhibiting local differences. While classical contextual bandits assume either
fully centralized data or entirely isolated learners, much remains unexplored
in networked environments when information is partially shared. In this paper,
we address this gap by developing two network-aware Upper Confidence Bound
(UCB) algorithms, NetLinUCB and Net-SGD-UCB, which enable adaptive information
sharing guided by dynamically updated network weights. Our approach decompose
learning into global and local components and as a result allow agents to
benefit from shared structure without full synchronization. Both algorithms
incur lighter communication costs compared to a fully centralized setting as
agents only share computed summaries regarding the homogeneous features. We
establish regret bounds showing that our methods reduce the learning complexity
associated with the shared structure from $O(N)$ to sublinear $O(\sqrt{N})$,
where $N$ is the size of the network. The two algorithms reveal complementary
strengths: NetLinUCB excels in low-noise regimes with fine-grained
heterogeneity, while Net-SGD-UCB is robust to high-dimensional, high-variance
contexts. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods across
simulated pricing environments compared to standard benchmarks.

*Jeremy Carleton,Debajoy Mukherjee,Srinivas Shakkottai,Dileep Kalathil*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAVIS是一个轻量级推理时对齐框架，通过价值引导搜索实现多目标LLM对齐，无需修改基础模型权重


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在多目标场景下需要为每个目标微调模型的计算成本高和灵活性差的问题

Method: 训练一组小型价值模型对应不同目标，推理时根据用户权重组合生成倾斜函数来调整输出分布

Result: MAVIS优于为每个目标微调模型的基线方法，接近为特定用户偏好微调的理想性能

Conclusion: MAVIS提供了一种高效灵活的多目标对齐方案，显著降低了计算成本同时保持良好性能

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse
applications that demand balancing multiple, often conflicting, objectives --
such as helpfulness, harmlessness, or humor. Aligning outputs to user-specific
preferences in such multi-objective settings typically requires fine-tuning
models for each objective or preference configuration, which is computationally
expensive and inflexible. We introduce MAVIS -- Multi-Objective Alignment via
Value-Guided Inference-Time Search -- a lightweight inference-time alignment
framework that enables dynamic control over LLM behavior without modifying the
base model's weights. MAVIS trains a set of small value models, each
corresponding to a distinct objective. At inference time, these value models
are combined using user-specified weights to produce a tilting function that
adjusts the base model's output distribution toward desired trade-offs. The
value models are trained using a simple iterative algorithm that ensures
monotonic improvement of the KL-regularized policy. We show empirically that
MAVIS outperforms baselines that fine-tune per-objective models and combine
them post hoc, and even approaches the performance of the idealized setting
where models are fine-tuned for a user's exact preferences.

Conclusion: EventTSF成功解决了多模态时间序列预测中的关键挑战，通过有效整合文本事件信息显著提升了非平稳时间序列的预测性能，为多模态时间序列分析提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a vital role in critical domains like energy
and transportation, where non-stationary dynamics are deeply intertwined with
events in other modalities such as texts. However, incorporating natural
language-based external events to improve non-stationary forecasting remains
largely unexplored, as most approaches still rely on a single modality,
resulting in limited contextual knowledge and model underperformance. Enabling
fine-grained multimodal interactions between temporal and textual data is
challenged by three fundamental issues: (1) the difficulty of fine-grained
synchronization between time-varying discrete textual events and continuous
time series; (2) the inherent temporal uncertainty introduced by textual
semantics; and (3) the misalignment between textual event embeddings and
multi-resolution temporal patterns. In this work, we address these challenges
by introducing event-aware non-stationary time series forecasting (EventTSF),
an autoregressive generation framework that integrates historical time series
with textual events to make subsequent forecasts. Specifically, EventTSF uses
autoregressive diffusion with flow matching at each step to capture nuanced
temporal-event interactions. To handle event-induced uncertainty, flow matching
timesteps are adaptively controlled according to event semantic signals. The
underlying denoiser employs a multimodal U-shaped diffusion transformer that
efficiently fuses temporal and textual modalities across different resolutions.
Extensive experiments on 8 synthetic and real-world datasets show that EventTSF
outperforms 12 baselines across diverse event-aware non-stationary time series
forecasting scenarios, achieving substantial improvements of 10.7% higher
forecasting accuracy and $1.13\times$ faster training efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的有向图神经网络由于各向同性聚合机制和局部滤波机制，难以同时捕捉方向语义和全局结构模式。

Method: 使用SVD分解将奇异向量作为方向投影基，奇异值作为缩放因子，通过Transformer的多头自注意力机制建模入边/出边模式的多尺度交互，显式保持特征传播过程中的边方向性。

Result: 在六个有向图基准测试上的广泛实验表明，SVDformer在节点分类任务上始终优于最先进的GNN和方向感知基线方法。

Conclusion: SVDformer为有向图上的表示学习建立了一个新范式，能够有效联合捕捉方向语义和全局结构模式。

Abstract: Directed graphs are widely used to model asymmetric relationships in
real-world systems. However, existing directed graph neural networks often
struggle to jointly capture directional semantics and global structural
patterns due to their isotropic aggregation mechanisms and localized filtering
mechanisms. To address this limitation, this paper proposes SVDformer, a novel
framework that synergizes SVD and Transformer architecture for direction-aware
graph representation learning. SVDformer first refines singular value
embeddings through multi-head self-attention, adaptively enhancing critical
spectral components while suppressing high-frequency noise. This enables
learnable low-pass/high-pass graph filtering without requiring spectral
kernels. Furthermore, by treating singular vectors as directional projection
bases and singular values as scaling factors, SVDformer uses the Transformer to
model multi-scale interactions between incoming/outgoing edge patterns through
attention weights, thereby explicitly preserving edge directionality during
feature propagation. Extensive experiments on six directed graph benchmarks
demonstrate that SVDformer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and
direction-aware baselines on node classification tasks, establishing a new
paradigm for learning representations on directed graphs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中机器学习模型面临在线标签偏移问题，标签分布随时间变化。传统方法需要仔细选择学习率，过低会减慢适应速度，过高会导致不稳定

Method: 提出ASAP方法，动态调整学习率：计算当前和先前未标注输出的余弦距离，并将其映射到有界范围内。无需标签、模型集成或历史输入，仅使用先前的softmax输出

Result: 在多个数据集和偏移场景的实验表明，ASAP持续提高准确性和效率

Conclusion: ASAP为无监督模型适应提供了一种实用解决方案，能够快速轻量地适应标签分布变化

Abstract: In real-world applications, machine learning models face online label shift,
where label distributions change over time. Effective adaptation requires
careful learning rate selection: too low slows adaptation and too high causes
instability. We propose ASAP (Adaptive Shift Aware Post-training), which
dynamically adjusts the learning rate by computing the cosine distance between
current and previous unlabeled outputs and mapping it within a bounded range.
ASAP requires no labels, model ensembles, or past inputs, using only the
previous softmax output for fast, lightweight adaptation. Experiments across
multiple datasets and shift scenarios show ASAP consistently improves accuracy
and efficiency, making it practical for unsupervised model adaptation.

Result: 在三个数据集上的广泛实验表明，相比基线模型具有更高的分类准确率和更低的层次违规率

Conclusion: HCAL分类器有效解决了传统多任务学习方法中的优化偏差问题，提高了层次多标签分类的性能和鲁棒性

Abstract: Hierarchical Multi-Label Classification (HMC) faces critical challenges in
maintaining structural consistency and balancing loss weighting in Multi-Task
Learning (MTL). In order to address these issues, we propose a classifier
called HCAL based on MTL integrated with prototype contrastive learning and
adaptive task-weighting mechanisms. The most significant advantage of our
classifier is semantic consistency including both prototype with explicitly
modeling label and feature aggregation from child classes to parent classes.
The other important advantage is an adaptive loss-weighting mechanism that
dynamically allocates optimization resources by monitoring task-specific
convergence rates. It effectively resolves the "one-strong-many-weak"
optimization bias inherent in traditional MTL approaches. To further enhance
robustness, a prototype perturbation mechanism is formulated by injecting
controlled noise into prototype to expand decision boundaries. Additionally, we
formalize a quantitative metric called Hierarchical Violation Rate (HVR) as to
evaluate hierarchical consistency and generalization. Extensive experiments
across three datasets demonstrate both the higher classification accuracy and
reduced hierarchical violation rate of the proposed classifier over baseline
models.

Abstract: This study presents a pipeline leveraging t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor
Embedding (t-SNE) for interpretable visualizations of chirp features across
diverse outcome scenarios. The dataset, comprising chirp-based temporal,
spectral, and frequency metrics. Using t-SNE, local neighborhood relationships
were preserved while addressing the crowding problem through Student
t-distribution-based similarity optimization. Three classification tasks were
formulated on the 2D t-SNE embeddings: (1) distinguishing clinical success from
failure/no-resection, (2) separating high-difficulty from low-difficulty cases,
and (3) identifying optimal cases, defined as successful outcomes with minimal
clinical difficulty. Four classifiers, namely, Random Forests, Support Vector
Machines, Logistic Regression, and k-Nearest Neighbors, were trained and
evaluated using stratified 5-fold cross-validation. Across tasks, the Random
Forest and k-NN classifiers demonstrated superior performance, achieving up to
88.8% accuracy in optimal case detection (successful outcomes with minimal
clinical difficulty). Additionally, feature influence sensitivity maps were
generated using SHAP explanations applied to model predicting t-SNE
coordinates, revealing spatially localized feature importance within the
embedding space. These maps highlighted how specific chirp attributes drive
regional clustering and class separation, offering insights into the latent
structure of the data. The integrated framework showcases the potential of
interpretable embeddings and local feature attribution for clinical
stratification and decision support.

Abstract: A primary challenge in using neural networks to approximate nonlinear
dynamical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) is
transforming these systems into a suitable format, especially when dealing with
non-linearizable dynamics or the need for infinite-dimensional spaces for
linearization. This paper introduces DyMixOp, a novel neural operator framework
for PDEs that integrates insights from complex dynamical systems to address
this challenge. Grounded in inertial manifold theory, DyMixOp transforms
infinite-dimensional nonlinear PDE dynamics into a finite-dimensional latent
space, establishing a structured foundation that maintains essential nonlinear
interactions and enhances physical interpretability. A key innovation is the
Local-Global-Mixing (LGM) transformation, inspired by convection dynamics in
turbulence. This transformation effectively captures both fine-scale details
and nonlinear interactions, while mitigating spectral bias commonly found in
existing neural operators. The framework is further strengthened by a
dynamics-informed architecture that connects multiple LGM layers to approximate
linear and nonlinear dynamics, reflecting the temporal evolution of dynamical
systems. Experimental results across diverse PDE benchmarks demonstrate that
DyMixOp achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly reducing
prediction errors, particularly in convection-dominated scenarios reaching up
to 86.7\%, while maintaining computational efficiency and scalability.

Motivation: 研究AI算法的不透明性问题，因为这是AI伦理发展面临的主要障碍，需要区分不同类型的不透明性及其伦理含义。

Method: 分为两部分分析：第一部分区分技术复杂性导致的固有黑盒性和商业保密性造成的有意隐藏；第二部分探讨计算机科学中开发的解释方法。

Result: 识别了两种不同的不透明性类型及其各自的伦理影响，发现XAI方法在克服技术不透明性方面仍面临诸多挑战。

Conclusion: AI算法的不透明性是一个多层面的问题，需要从技术和伦理角度共同解决，当前的可解释AI技术仍不足以完全解决这一问题。

Abstract: The opaqueness of many complex machine learning algorithms is often mentioned
as one of the main obstacles to the ethical development of artificial
intelligence (AI). But what does it mean for an algorithm to be opaque? Highly
complex algorithms such as artificial neural networks process enormous volumes
of data in parallel along multiple hidden layers of interconnected nodes,
rendering their inner workings epistemically inaccessible to any human being,
including their designers and developers; they are "black boxes" for all their
stakeholders. But opaqueness is not always the inevitable result of technical
complexity. Sometimes, the way an algorithm works is intentionally hidden from
view for proprietary reasons, especially in commercial automated decision
systems, creating an entirely different type of opaqueness. In the first part
of the chapter, we will examine these two ways of understanding opacity and the
ethical implications that stem from each of them. In the second part, we
explore the different explanatory methods that have been developed in computer
science to overcome an AI system's technical opaqueness. As the analysis shows,
explainable AI (XAI) still faces numerous challenges.

Conclusion: CALYPSO框架能够提供准确、可解释的多空间分辨率预测，支持感染控制政策和爆发风险的反事实分析，为公共卫生决策提供有力工具。

Abstract: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a critical public
health threat within hospitals as well as long-term care facilities. Better
understanding of MRSA risks, evaluation of interventions and forecasting MRSA
rates are important public health problems. Existing forecasting models rely on
statistical or neural network approaches, which lack epidemiological
interpretability, and have limited performance. Mechanistic epidemic models are
difficult to calibrate and limited in incorporating diverse datasets. We
present CALYPSO, a hybrid framework that integrates neural networks with
mechanistic metapopulation models to capture the spread dynamics of infectious
diseases (i.e., MRSA) across healthcare and community settings. Our model
leverages patient-level insurance claims, commuting data, and healthcare
transfer patterns to learn region- and time-specific parameters governing MRSA
spread. This enables accurate, interpretable forecasts at multiple spatial
resolutions (county, healthcare facility, region, state) and supports
counterfactual analyses of infection control policies and outbreak risks. We
also show that CALYPSO improves statewide forecasting performance by over 4.5%
compared to machine learning baselines, while also identifying high-risk
regions and cost-effective strategies for allocating infection prevention
resources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前基于常见基因变异的风险预测模型准确性不足，需要综合考虑常见和稀有变异来提高预测性能。

Method: 提出CROC方法，是对现有FROC方法的扩展，特别添加了处理稀有变异的流程。使用了37个候选基因的533个SNPs进行验证。

Result: 统合所有SNPs的预测模型准确性更高(AUC=0.605)，明显超过仅使用常见变异的模型(AUC=0.585)。在稀有变异主导的场景下，CROC方法表现更优(AUC=0.603 vs 0.524)。

Conclusion: CROC方法能够有效统合常见和稀有变异信息，显著提高风险预测的准确性，对于全面利用基因组数据具有重要意义。

Abstract: Risk prediction that capitalizes on emerging genetic findings holds great
promise for improving public health and clinical care. However, recent risk
prediction research has shown that predictive tests formed on existing common
genetic loci, including those from genome-wide association studies, have lacked
sufficient accuracy for clinical use. Because most rare variants on the genome
have not yet been studied for their role in risk prediction, future disease
prediction discoveries should shift toward a more comprehensive risk prediction
strategy that takes into account both common and rare variants. We are
proposing a collapsing receiver operating characteristic CROC approach for risk
prediction research on both common and rare variants. The new approach is an
extension of a previously developed forward ROC FROC approach, with additional
procedures for handling rare variants. The approach was evaluated through the
use of 533 single-nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs in 37 candidate genes from the
Genetic Analysis Workshop 17 mini-exome data set. We found that a prediction
model built on all SNPs gained more accuracy AUC = 0.605 than one built on
common variants alone AUC = 0.585. We further evaluated the performance of two
approaches by gradually reducing the number of common variants in the analysis.
We found that the CROC method attained more accuracy than the FROC method when
the number of common variants in the data decreased. In an extreme scenario,
when there are only rare variants in the data, the CROC reached an AUC value of
0.603, whereas the FROC had an AUC value of 0.524.

Abstract: The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2019, designated
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as a serious antimicrobial
resistance threat. The risk of acquiring MRSA and suffering life-threatening
consequences due to it remains especially high for hospitalized patients due to
a unique combination of factors, including: co-morbid conditions, immuno
suppression, antibiotic use, and risk of contact with contaminated hospital
workers and equipment. In this paper, we present a novel generative
probabilistic model, GenHAI, for modeling sequences of MRSA test results
outcomes for patients during a single hospitalization. This model can be used
to answer many important questions from the perspectives of hospital
administrators for mitigating the risk of MRSA infections. Our model is based
on the probabilistic programming paradigm, and can be used to approximately
answer a variety of predictive, causal, and counterfactual questions. We
demonstrate the efficacy of our model by comparing it against discriminative
and generative machine learning models using two real-world datasets.

Conclusion: GLF框架为自监督对比学习提供了统一视角，ADC方法通过增强类内紧凑性和类间分离性显著提升了学习效果。

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (SSCL) has recently demonstrated
superiority in multiple downstream tasks. In this paper, we generalize the
standard SSCL methods to a Generalized Learning Framework (GLF) consisting of
two parts: the aligning part and the constraining part. We analyze three
existing SSCL methods: BYOL, Barlow Twins, and SwAV, and show that they can be
unified under GLF with different choices of the constraining part. We further
propose empirical and theoretical analyses providing two insights into
designing the constraining part of GLF: intra-class compactness and inter-class
separability, which measure how well the feature space preserves the class
information of the inputs. However, since SSCL can not use labels, it is
challenging to design a constraining part that satisfies these properties. To
address this issue, we consider inducing intra-class compactness and
inter-class separability by iteratively capturing the dynamic relationship
between anchor and other samples and propose a plug-and-play method called
Adaptive Distribution Calibration (ADC) to ensure that samples that are near or
far from the anchor point in the original input space are closer or further
away from the anchor point in the feature space. Both the theoretical analysis
and the empirical evaluation demonstrate the superiority of ADC.

low-precision arithmetics to scale large models. This paper proposes performing
probabilistic inference in the quantized, discrete parameter space created by
these representations, effectively enabling us to learn a continuous
distribution using discrete parameters. We consider both 2D densities and
quantized neural networks, where we introduce a tractable learning approach
using probabilistic circuits. This method offers a scalable solution to manage
complex distributions and provides clear insights into model behavior. We
validate our approach with various models, demonstrating inference efficiency
without sacrificing accuracy. This work advances scalable, interpretable
machine learning by utilizing discrete approximations for probabilistic
computations.

Abstract: Causal inference often hinges on strong assumptions - such as no unmeasured
confounding or perfect compliance - that are rarely satisfied in practice.
Partial identification offers a principled alternative: instead of relying on
unverifiable assumptions to estimate causal effects precisely, it derives
bounds that reflect the uncertainty inherent in the data. Despite its
theoretical appeal, partial identification remains underutilized in applied
work, in part due to the fragmented nature of existing methods and the lack of
practical guidance. This thesis addresses these challenges by systematically
comparing a diverse set of bounding algorithms across multiple causal
scenarios. We implement, extend, and unify state-of-the-art methods - including
symbolic, optimization-based, and information-theoretic approaches - within a
common evaluation framework. In particular, we propose an extension of a
recently introduced entropy-bounded method, making it applicable to
counterfactual queries such as the Probability of Necessity and Sufficiency
(PNS). Our empirical study spans thousands of randomized simulations involving
both discrete and continuous data-generating processes. We assess each method
in terms of bound tightness, computational efficiency, and robustness to
assumption violations. To support practitioners, we distill our findings into a
practical decision tree for algorithm selection and train a machine learning
model to predict the best-performing method based on observable data
characteristics.
  All implementations are released as part of an open-source Python package,
CausalBoundingEngine, which enables users to apply and compare bounding methods
through a unified interface.

TL;DR: FedOL是一个单轮通信的联邦学习框架，通过知识蒸馏在公共数据集上交换预测输出而非模型参数，解决了传统FL的通信开销大、模型架构统一限制和客户端计算负担重的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦学习需要多轮通信和统一模型架构，对客户端计算资源要求高且通信开销大。移动网络中客户端拥有宝贵私有数据但计算资源有限，需要更高效的协作学习方案

Method: 使用知识蒸馏技术，客户端在未标注公共数据集上生成预测输出并发送给服务器。服务器通过专门的损失函数迭代优化伪标签和服务器模型，采用定制化的伪标签生成和知识蒸馏策略整合多样化知识

Result: 仿真结果表明FedOL显著优于现有基线方法，为移动网络提供了成本效益高的解决方案

Conclusion: FedOL通过单轮通信实现高效联邦学习，降低了通信开销，支持异构模型架构，有效解决了客户端数据分布偏差和公共数据集无标注的挑战

Abstract: Large models, renowned for superior performance, outperform smaller ones even
without billion-parameter scales. While mobile network servers have ample
computational resources to support larger models than client devices, privacy
constraints prevent clients from directly sharing their raw data. Federated
Learning (FL) enables decentralized clients to collaboratively train a shared
model by exchanging model parameters instead of transmitting raw data. Yet, it
requires a uniform model architecture and multiple communication rounds, which
neglect resource heterogeneity, impose heavy computational demands on clients,
and increase communication overhead. To address these challenges, we propose
FedOL, to construct a larger and more comprehensive server model in one-shot
settings (i.e., in a single communication round). Instead of model parameter
sharing, FedOL employs knowledge distillation, where clients only exchange
model prediction outputs on an unlabeled public dataset. This reduces
communication overhead by transmitting compact predictions instead of full
model weights and enables model customization by allowing heterogeneous model
architectures. A key challenge in this setting is that client predictions may
be biased due to skewed local data distributions, and the lack of ground-truth
labels in the public dataset further complicates reliable learning. To mitigate
these issues, FedOL introduces a specialized objective function that
iteratively refines pseudo-labels and the server model, improving learning
reliability. To complement this, FedOL incorporates a tailored pseudo-label
generation and knowledge distillation strategy that effectively integrates
diverse knowledge. Simulation results show that FedOL significantly outperforms
existing baselines, offering a cost-effective solution for mobile networks
where clients possess valuable private data but limited computational
resources.

TL;DR: T2W是一个基于扩散变换器的框架，能够根据自然语言描述生成特定任务的神经网络权重，在多个数据集上表现出色，超越了基于优化的初始化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前神经网络权重生成方法在泛化到未见任务和实际应用探索方面存在困难，需要一种能够根据文本描述直接生成任务特定权重的解决方案。

Method: 提出T2W框架：将网络参数分层处理为统一块，通过先验注意力机制集成CLIP文本嵌入，采用对抗训练和权重空间增强来提高泛化能力。

Result: 在Cifar100、Caltech256和TinyImageNet上的实验表明，T2W能够为未见任务生成高质量权重，性能优于优化初始化方法，并支持权重增强和文本引导模型融合等新应用。

Conclusion: 该工作将文本语义与权重空间动态联系起来，通过开源文本-权重对数据集推进了生成模型在神经网络参数合成中的实用性。

Abstract: How far are we really from automatically generating neural networks? While
neural network weight generation shows promise, current approaches struggle
with generalization to unseen tasks and practical application exploration. To
address this, we propose T2W, a diffusion transformer framework that generates
task-specific weights conditioned on natural language descriptions. T2W
hierarchically processes network parameters into uniform blocks, integrates
text embeddings from CLIP via a prior attention mechanism, and employs
adversarial training with weight-space augmentation to enhance generalization.
Experiments on Cifar100, Caltech256, and TinyImageNet demonstrate T2W's ability
to produce high-quality weights for unseen tasks, outperforming
optimization-based initialization and enabling novel applications such as
weight enhancement and text-guided model fusion. Our work bridges textual
semantics with weight-space dynamics, supported by an open-source dataset of
text-weight pairs, advancing the practicality of generative models in neural
network parameter synthesis. Our code is available on Github.

Motivation: 现有学习率调整方法复杂且需要手动调参，计算成本高、耗时耗能，需要一种更自然、自动化的学习率调整机制。

Method: 利用随机二阶算法开发可解释的学习率调整机制，根据随机梯度的范数变化自动调整学习率（梯度范数减小则增加学习率，增大则减小学习率），无需额外参数调优。

Result: 该方法在不同经典随机算法（SGD、SGDM、SIGNSGD）和机器学习任务中表现出高效性、鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 提出的自动学习率调整机制基于梯度内在变化，简化了调参过程，提高了训练效率和性能。

Abstract: Modern machine learning is trained by stochastic gradient descent (SGD),
whose performance critically depends on how the learning rate (LR) is adjusted
and decreased over time. Yet existing LR regimes may be intricate, or need to
tune one or more additional hyper-parameters manually whose bottlenecks include
huge computational expenditure, time and power in practice. This work, in a
natural and direct manner, clarifies how LR should be updated automatically
only according to the intrinsic variation of stochastic gradients. An
explainable LR regime by leveraging stochastic second-order algorithms is
developed, behaving a similar pattern to heuristic algorithms but implemented
simply without any parameter tuning requirement, where it is of an automatic
procedure that LR should increase (decrease) as the norm of stochastic
gradients decreases (increases). The resulting LR regime shows its efficiency,
robustness, and scalability in different classical stochastic algorithms,
containing SGD, SGDM, and SIGNSGD, on machine learning tasks.

Result: 在多个图数据集上优于现有的个性化子图联邦学习方法，表现出快速的模型收敛速度，并能有效泛化到新客户端。

Conclusion: FedSheafHN通过层状协作机制和超网络技术，有效解决了子图联邦学习中的异构性问题，提供了更好的个性化模型性能。

Abstract: Graph-structured data is prevalent in many applications. In subgraph
federated learning (FL), this data is distributed across clients, each with a
local subgraph. Personalized subgraph FL aims to develop a customized model for
each client to handle diverse data distributions. However, performance
variation across clients remains a key issue due to the heterogeneity of local
subgraphs. To overcome the challenge, we propose FedSheafHN, a novel framework
built on a sheaf collaboration mechanism to unify enhanced client descriptors
with efficient personalized model generation. Specifically, FedSheafHN embeds
each client's local subgraph into a server-constructed collaboration graph by
leveraging graph-level embeddings and employing sheaf diffusion within the
collaboration graph to enrich client representations. Subsequently, FedSheafHN
generates customized client models via a server-optimized hypernetwork.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate that FedSheafHN outperforms existing
personalized subgraph FL methods on various graph datasets. Additionally, it
exhibits fast model convergence and effectively generalizes to new clients.

TL;DR: GRAFT是一种可扩展的训练中子集选择方法，通过低秩特征表示和Fast MaxVol采样器选择多样化子集，动态调整子集大小，在保持训练轨迹的同时减少计算成本、能耗和碳排放。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代神经网络在大型数据集上的训练计算成本和环境代价高昂，需要开发高效的训练方法来减少资源消耗。

Method: 提取每批数据的低秩特征表示，应用Fast MaxVol采样器选择覆盖主导子空间的小型多样化子集，并使用梯度近似准则动态调整子集大小。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，GRAFT在准确性和效率方面匹配或超越了现有选择基线，提供了准确性、效率和排放之间的有利权衡。

Conclusion: GRAFT通过在低秩子空间中操作并训练精心选择的样本而非完整批次，能够显著减少训练时间、能耗和碳排放，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Training modern neural networks on large datasets is computationally and
environmentally costly. We introduce GRAFT, a scalable in-training subset
selection method that (i) extracts a low-rank feature representation for each
batch, (ii) applies a Fast MaxVol sampler to select a small, diverse subset
that spans the batch's dominant subspace, and (iii) dynamically adjusts the
subset size using a gradient-approximation criterion. By operating in low-rank
subspaces and training on carefully chosen examples instead of full batches,
GRAFT preserves the training trajectory while reducing wall-clock time, energy
consumption, and $\mathrm{CO}_2$ emissions. Across multiple benchmarks, GRAFT
matches or exceeds recent selection baselines in both accuracy and efficiency,
providing a favorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and emissions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM主要依赖数据和训练规模扩展以及推理时扩展，本文旨在探索在查询输入阶段投入资源的输入时间缩放范式，以补充现有的扩展方法。

Method: 在训练和测试阶段结合LLM的元知识，使用不同策略精炼输入，包括向查询添加不相关信息、从最小过滤数据集中随机选择示例等方法。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct上实验，在AIME24和AIME25上达到76.7%的SOTA性能，多数投票后可达AIME24(76.7%)和AIME25(80%)，从DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B开始最佳结果达AIME24(86.7%)和AIME25(76.7%)。

Conclusion: 输入时间缩放是有效的扩展范式，训练-测试协同设计至关重要，看似低质量的数据集也能获得高性能，挑战了传统数据质量观念，小样本即可激发高级推理能力。

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually post-trained on large-scale
carefully curated datasets (data & training scaling) and doing reasoning in
test time (inference time scaling). In this work, we present a new scaling
paradigm, Input Time Scaling, to complement previous scaling methods by putting
resources on queries (input time). During training and testing, we combine
meta-knowledge from LLMs to refine inputs with different strategies. We also
find a new phenomenon, training-testing co-design there. We need to apply query
strategies during both training and testing. Only applying strategies on
training or testing would seriously degrade the performance. We are also
surprised to find that seemingly low data quality datasets can gain high
performance. Adding irrelevant information to the queries, randomly selecting
examples from a minimally filtered dataset, can even perform the best. These
findings contradict the widely held inductive bias, "garbage in, garbage out".
Curating datasets with seemingly high-quality data can even potentially limit
the performance ceiling. In addition, models trained on more data with similar
quality (15k VS 1k) perform worse, simple dataset size scaling should also be
carefully inspected. The good news is that our findings are compatible with the
Less is More phenomenon. A small set of examples is enough to evoke high-level
reasoning ability. With experiments on models trained on Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct,
we are able to reach SOTA performance among 32B models on AIME24(76.7%) and
AIME25(76.7%) pass@1. We can further achieve AIME24(76.7%) and AIME25(80%) with
a majority vote of three models. Starting from DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B,
the best result would be 86.7% on AIME24 and 76.7% on AIME25. To facilitate
reproducibility and further research, we are working on open-source our
datasets, data pipelines, evaluation results, and checkpoints.

Conclusion: 成功扩展了CASH框架以适应现代ML流水线，PS-PFN方法为异构ML流水线的自动选择和适应提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter Optimization (CASH) has been
fundamental to traditional AutoML systems. However, with the advancements of
pre-trained models, modern ML workflows go beyond hyperparameter optimization
and often require fine-tuning, ensembling, and other adaptation techniques.
While the core challenge of identifying the best-performing model for a
downstream task remains, the increasing heterogeneity of ML pipelines demands
novel AutoML approaches. This work extends the CASH framework to select and
adapt modern ML pipelines. We propose PS-PFN to efficiently explore and exploit
adapting ML pipelines by extending Posterior Sampling (PS) to the max k-armed
bandit problem setup. PS-PFN leverages prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) to
efficiently estimate the posterior distribution of the maximal value via
in-context learning. We show how to extend this method to consider varying
costs of pulling arms and to use different PFNs to model reward distributions
individually per arm. Experimental results on one novel and two existing
standard benchmark tasks demonstrate the superior performance of PS-PFN
compared to other bandit and AutoML strategies. We make our code and data
available at https://github.com/amirbalef/CASHPlus.

TL;DR: 提出了一个对抗性重尾bandit问题的通用框架，通过精心设计的奖励函数和HT-SPM学习率，首次实现了重尾MAB和线性bandit的最佳两界(BOBW)算法，在对抗性和随机性环境下都达到了最优的遗憾界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有重尾bandit研究主要集中于随机性环境，对抗性环境下的研究很少且仅限于多臂bandit的特殊情况，缺乏通用的对抗性重尾bandit框架和算法。

Method: 采用FTRL方法，在损失估计上添加奖励函数，设计了HT-SPM数据依赖学习率，使用方差缩减的线性损失估计器。

Result: 首次实现了重尾MAB的BOBW算法(对抗性O~(T^{1/ε})，随机性O~(log T))，以及重尾线性bandit的BOBW结果(O~(d^{1/2}T^{1/ε}))。

Conclusion: 提出的框架和HT-SPM学习率为对抗性重尾bandit问题提供了通用解决方案，填补了该领域的研究空白，并在理论和算法层面取得了突破性进展。

Abstract: Heavy-tailed bandits have been extensively studied since the seminal work of
\citet{Bubeck2012BanditsWH}. In particular, heavy-tailed linear bandits,
enabling efficient learning with both a large number of arms and heavy-tailed
noises, have recently attracted significant attention
\citep{ShaoYKL18,XueWWZ20,ZhongHYW21,Wang2025heavy,tajdini2025improved}.
However, prior studies focus almost exclusively on stochastic regimes, with few
exceptions limited to the special case of heavy-tailed multi-armed bandits
(MABs) \citep{Huang0H22,ChengZ024,Chen2024uniINF}.
  In this work, we propose a general framework for adversarial heavy-tailed
bandit problems, which performs follow-the-regularized-leader (FTRL) over the
loss estimates shifted by a bonus function. Via a delicate setup of the bonus
function, we devise the first FTRL-type best-of-both-worlds (BOBW) algorithm
for heavy-tailed MABs, which does not require the truncated non-negativity
assumption and achieves an $\widetilde{O}(T^{\frac{1}{\varepsilon}})$
worst-case regret in the adversarial regime as well as an $\widetilde{O}(\log
T)$ gap-dependent regret in the stochastic regime. We then extend our framework
to the linear case, proposing the first algorithm for adversarial heavy-tailed
linear bandits with finite arm sets. This algorithm achieves an
$\widetilde{O}(d^{\frac{1}{2}}T^{\frac{1}{\varepsilon}})$ regret, matching the
best-known worst-case regret bound in stochastic regimes. Moreover, we propose
a general data-dependent learning rate, termed \textit{heavy-tailed noise aware
stability-penalty matching} (HT-SPM). We prove that HT-SPM guarantees BOBW
regret bounds for general heavy-tailed bandit problems once certain conditions
are satisfied. By using HT-SPM and, in particular, a variance-reduced linear
loss estimator, we obtain the first BOBW result for heavy-tailed linear
bandits.

Abstract: Existing research on single-machine scheduling is largely focused on exact
algorithms, which perform well on typical instances but can significantly
deteriorate on certain regions of the problem space. In contrast, data-driven
approaches provide strong and scalable performance when tailored to the
structure of specific datasets. Leveraging this idea, we focus on a
single-machine scheduling problem where each job is defined by its weight,
duration, due date, and deadline, aiming to minimize the total weight of tardy
jobs. We introduce a novel data-driven scheduling heuristic that combines
machine learning with problem-specific characteristics, ensuring feasible
solutions, which is a common challenge for ML-based algorithms. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art in terms of optimality gap, number of optimal solutions, and
adaptability across varied data scenarios, highlighting its flexibility for
practical applications. In addition, we conduct a systematic exploration of ML
models, addressing a common gap in similar studies by offering a detailed model

Abstract: This paper proposes a Trans-XFed architecture that combines federated
learning with explainable AI techniques for supply chain credit assessment. The
proposed model aims to address several key challenges, including privacy,
information silos, class imbalance, non-identically and independently
distributed (Non-IID) data, and model interpretability in supply chain credit
assessment. We introduce a performance-based client selection strategy (PBCS)
to tackle class imbalance and Non-IID problems. This strategy achieves faster
convergence by selecting clients with higher local F1 scores. The FedProx
architecture, enhanced with homomorphic encryption, is used as the core model,
and further incorporates a transformer encoder. The transformer encoder block
provides insights into the learned features. Additionally, we employ the
integrated gradient explainable AI technique to offer insights into
decision-making. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Trans-XFed through
experimental evaluations on real-world supply chain datasets. The obtained
results show its ability to deliver accurate credit assessments compared to
several baselines, while maintaining transparency and privacy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有降维方法要么专注于保持局部结构（如t-SNE、UMAP），要么专注于保持全局结构（如MDS、PCA），但没有方法能够同时很好地保持这两个方面的结构。

Method: 通过简单的正则化项将t-SNE的局部结构保持与PCA的全局结构保持相结合，生成从局部结构良好的t-SNE嵌入到全局结构良好的PCA嵌入之间的谱系嵌入。

Result: 在七个真实数据集（包括五个单细胞转录组数据集和一个群体遗传学数据集）上进行了基准测试，定性和定量结果都显示DREAMS在多尺度结构保持方面优于先前方法。

Conclusion: DREAMS方法能够有效平衡局部和全局结构保持，在多尺度数据可视化方面表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction techniques are widely used for visualizing
high-dimensional data in two dimensions. Existing methods are typically
designed to preserve either local (e.g. $t$-SNE, UMAP) or global (e.g. MDS,
PCA) structure of the data, but none of the established methods can represent
both aspects well. In this paper, we present DREAMS (Dimensionality Reduction
Enhanced Across Multiple Scales), a method that combines the local structure
preservation of $t$-SNE with the global structure preservation of PCA via a
simple regularization term. Our approach generates a spectrum of embeddings
between the locally well-structured $t$-SNE embedding and the globally
well-structured PCA embedding, efficiently balancing both local and global
structure preservation. We benchmark DREAMS across seven real-world datasets,
including five from single-cell transcriptomics and one from population
genetics, showcasing qualitatively and quantitatively its superior ability to
preserve structure across multiple scales compared to previous approaches.

Motivation: 传统老虎机算法主要关注最大化累积奖励，但夏普比率优化需要在获得高回报和控制风险之间取得平衡，这需要对均值和方差进行仔细探索。

Method: 采用Thompson Sampling贝叶斯方法，在未知参数的高斯奖励假设下，设计了专门针对夏普比率的遗憾分解方法，提出了SRTS算法。

Conclusion: Thompson Sampling在夏普比率最大化问题上表现出色，通过信息获取驱动学习效率，在风险调整性能下实现了最优的探索-利用平衡。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of sequential decision-making for
Sharpe ratio (SR) maximization in a stochastic bandit setting. We focus on the
Thompson Sampling (TS) algorithm, a Bayesian approach celebrated for its
empirical performance and exploration efficiency, under the assumption of
Gaussian rewards with unknown parameters. Unlike conventional bandit objectives
focusing on maximizing cumulative reward, Sharpe ratio optimization instead
introduces an inherent tradeoff between achieving high returns and controlling
risk, demanding careful exploration of both mean and variance. Our theoretical
contributions include a novel regret decomposition specifically designed for
the Sharpe ratio, highlighting the role of information acquisition about the
reward distribution in driving learning efficiency. Then, we establish
fundamental performance limits for the proposed algorithm \texttt{SRTS} in
terms of an upper bound on regret. We also derive the matching lower bound and
show the order-optimality. Our results show that Thompson Sampling achieves
logarithmic regret over time, with distribution-dependent factors capturing the
difficulty of distinguishing arms based on risk-adjusted performance. Empirical
simulations show that our algorithm significantly outperforms existing
algorithms.

TL;DR: RLVR算法存在深度和广度两个被忽视的维度。研究发现GRPO算法存在系统性偏差，过度加权中等准确率样本而忽视困难样本。提出了DARS方法通过多阶段rollout重新加权困难问题，以及DARS-B方法结合大batch训练，在Pass@K和Pass@1指标上均取得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习与可验证奖励(RLVR)在大型语言模型推理能力开发中潜力巨大，但深度(模型能采样的最难问题)和广度(单次迭代消耗的实例数量)两个维度未被充分探索。研究发现现有GRPO算法存在系统性偏差，需要解决这些问题来释放RLVR的完整潜力。

Method: 1. 提出Difficulty Adaptive Rollout Sampling (DARS)：通过目标多阶段rollout重新加权困难问题，增加困难问题的正rollout数量
2. 引入大batch训练：用全batch更新替换PPO的小batch迭代，进行多epoch训练
3. 结合两者提出DARS-B方法

Result: DARS在Pass@K指标上带来一致增益且无需额外推理成本；大batch训练显著提升Pass@1性能；DARS-B同时提升了Pass@K和Pass@1；大batch训练维持了高token级熵，表明持续探索和减少梯度噪声

Conclusion: 深度和广度是RLVR中正交的两个维度，自适应深度探索和大batch广度训练的结合是释放RLVR推理能力的关键。DARS和DARS-B方法有效解决了现有算法的系统性偏差问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm for unlocking reasoning capabilities in large language
models, yet its full potential is hindered by two under-explored dimensions:
Depth-the hardest problem a model can sample; Breadth-the number of instances
consumed in a single iteration. We dissect the popular GRPO algorithm and
reveal a systematic bias: the cumulative-advantage disproportionately weights
samples with medium accuracy, while down-weighting the low-accuracy instances
that are crucial for pushing reasoning boundaries. To rectify the depth
neglect, we introduce Difficulty Adaptive Rollout Sampling (DARS), which
re-weights hard problems through targeted multi-stage rollouts, thereby
increasing the number of positive rollouts for hard problems. Empirically,
naively enlarging rollout size only accelerates convergence and even hurts
Pass@K. Our DARS, in contrast, delivers consistent Pass@K gains without extra
inference cost at convergence. Just as we adaptively expanded the depth of
exploration, we now ask whether aggressively scaling the breadth of training
data can further amplify reasoning gains. To this end, we intensely scale batch
size and replace PPO's mini-batch iterations with full-batch updates over
multiple epochs. Increasing breadth significantly enhances Pass@1 performance.
Large-breadth training sustains high token-level entropy, indicating continued
exploration and reduced gradient noise. We further present DARS-B, which
augments DARS with large breadth, and demonstrate simultaneous gains in Pass@K
and Pass@1. The results confirm that breadth and adaptive exploration across
depth operate as orthogonal dimensions in RLVR, which are key to unleashing the
reasoning power of RLVR.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PENGUIN是一种新的时间序列预测模型，通过周期性嵌套分组注意力机制，显式建模周期性模式并引入相对注意力偏置，在多个基准测试中优于MLP和Transformer模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Transformer在时间序列预测中取得突破，但其有效性仍存争议。作者认为需要重新审视自注意力的重要性，并显式建模周期性模式。

Method: 提出周期性嵌套分组注意力机制(PENGUIN)，包括周期性嵌套相对注意力偏置来直接捕获周期结构，以及分组注意力机制处理多个共存周期性（如日周期和周周期）。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，PENGUIN持续优于基于MLP和Transformer的模型。

Conclusion: 显式建模周期性模式和引入相对注意力偏置对于时间序列建模至关重要，PENGUIN提供了一种简单而有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) is a fundamental task with
wide-ranging applications. Although Transformer-based models have made
significant breakthroughs in forecasting, their effectiveness for time series
forecasting remains debatable. In this paper, we revisit the significance of
self-attention and propose a simple yet effective mechanism, Periodic-Nested
Group Attention, namely PENGUIN. Our approach highlights the importance of
explicitly modeling periodic patterns and incorporating relative attention bias
for effective time series modeling. To this end, we introduce a periodic-nested
relative attention bias that captures periodic structures directly. To handle
multiple coexisting periodicities (e.g., daily and weekly cycles), we design a
grouped attention mechanism, where each group targets a specific periodicity
using a multi-query attention mechanism. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks demonstrate that PENGUIN consistently outperforms both MLP-based and
Transformer-based models.

TL;DR: ISP是一种自适应机制，动态确定每轮训练的最佳客户端数量，在保持模型精度的同时提升联邦学习的通信效率，最高可节省30%通信成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习虽然解决了深度学习模型扩展的挑战，但通信效率仍是关键瓶颈，特别是在异构和动态客户端参与环境下。现有方法对每轮选择多少客户端的问题研究不足

Method: 提出智能参与者选择(ISP)机制，动态自适应地确定每轮训练的最佳客户端数量，通过优化客户端参与策略来提升通信效率

Result: 在多种设置下验证有效性，包括视觉变换器、真实ECG分类和梯度压缩训练。结果显示可节省高达30%的通信成本且不影响最终模型质量

Conclusion: 客户端数量选择应作为联邦学习的一个独立任务来处理，ISP机制为解决通信效率瓶颈提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Rapid scaling of deep learning models has enabled performance gains across
domains, yet it introduced several challenges. Federated Learning (FL) has
emerged as a promising framework to address these concerns by enabling
decentralized training. Nevertheless, communication efficiency remains a key
bottleneck in FL, particularly under heterogeneous and dynamic client
participation. Existing methods, such as FedAvg and FedProx, or other
approaches, including client selection strategies, attempt to mitigate
communication costs. However, the problem of choosing the number of clients in
a training round remains extremely underexplored. We introduce Intelligent
Selection of Participants (ISP), an adaptive mechanism that dynamically
determines the optimal number of clients per round to enhance communication
efficiency without compromising model accuracy. We validate the effectiveness
of ISP across diverse setups, including vision transformers, real-world ECG
classification, and training with gradient compression. Our results show
consistent communication savings of up to 30\% without losing the final
quality. Applying ISP to different real-world ECG classification setups
highlighted the selection of the number of clients as a separate task of
federated learning.

Motivation: 随着AI系统越来越依赖训练数据，评估数据集可信度变得至关重要，特别是对于偏见等仅在数据集层面显现的属性。现有工作仅评估单个数据的可信度，无法评估数据集级别的全局属性

Method: 基于主观逻辑构建形式化框架，支持信任命题和不确定性量化，能够处理证据不完整、分布式和冲突的场景。在交通标志识别数据集上实例化偏见可信度属性

Conclusion: 提出的框架为AI训练数据集的可信度评估提供了首个形式化方法，特别适用于评估偏见等全局属性，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: As AI systems increasingly rely on training data, assessing dataset
trustworthiness has become critical, particularly for properties like fairness
or bias that emerge at the dataset level. Prior work has used Subjective Logic
to assess trustworthiness of individual data, but not to evaluate
trustworthiness properties that emerge only at the level of the dataset as a
whole. This paper introduces the first formal framework for assessing the
trustworthiness of AI training datasets, enabling uncertainty-aware evaluations
of global properties such as bias. Built on Subjective Logic, our approach
supports trust propositions and quantifies uncertainty in scenarios where
evidence is incomplete, distributed, and/or conflicting. We instantiate this
framework on the trustworthiness property of bias, and we experimentally
evaluate it based on a traffic sign recognition dataset. The results
demonstrate that our method captures class imbalance and remains interpretable
and robust in both centralized and federated contexts.

Result: 在IR基准数据集上的数值比较显示，该方法相比竞争对手具有更高的效率

Conclusion: 该方法为不平衡回归问题提供了一种有效的解决方案，通过潜在空间的数据生成技术改善了标准算法在不平衡数据上的性能

Abstract: Imbalanced distribution learning is a common and significant challenge in
predictive modeling, often reducing the performance of standard algorithms.
Although various approaches address this issue, most are tailored to
classification problems, with a limited focus on regression. This paper
introduces a novel method to improve learning on tabular data within the
Imbalanced Regression (IR) framework, which is a critical problem. We propose
using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to model and define a latent
representation of data distributions. However, VAEs can be inefficient with
imbalanced data like other standard approaches. To address this, we develop an
innovative data generation method that combines a disentangled VAE with a
Smoothed Bootstrap applied in the latent space. We evaluate the efficiency of
this method through numerical comparisons with competitors on benchmark
datasets for IR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然迭代剪枝历史上更广泛被采用，但这种偏好常常是假设而非严格验证。需要系统性评估两种方法的真实性能差异。

Method: 进行了系统性的对比研究，包括严格定义方法、在结构化和非结构化设置下测试、应用不同剪枝标准和模态。基于发现提出了耐心基础的剪枝和混合方法。

Result: 发现一次性剪枝在低剪枝比下更有效，而迭代剪枝在高剪枝比下表现更好。混合方法在某些场景下能够超过传统方法。

Conclusion: 研究为实践者选择剪枝策略提供了价值丰富的见解，应根据具体目标和约束来选择适合的剪枝方法。

Abstract: Pruning is a core technique for compressing neural networks to improve
computational efficiency. This process is typically approached in two ways:
one-shot pruning, which involves a single pass of training and pruning, and
iterative pruning, where pruning is performed over multiple cycles for
potentially finer network refinement. Although iterative pruning has
historically seen broader adoption, this preference is often assumed rather
than rigorously tested. Our study presents one of the first systematic and
comprehensive comparisons of these methods, providing rigorous definitions,
benchmarking both across structured and unstructured settings, and applying
different pruning criteria and modalities. We find that each method has
specific advantages: one-shot pruning proves more effective at lower pruning
ratios, while iterative pruning performs better at higher ratios. Building on
these findings, we advocate for patience-based pruning and introduce a hybrid
approach that can outperform traditional methods in certain scenarios,
providing valuable insights for practitioners selecting a pruning strategy
tailored to their goals and constraints. Source code is available at

TL;DR: FedUP是一种轻量级的联邦遗忘算法，通过剪枝特定连接来高效消除恶意客户端对全局模型的影响，无需完全重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习容易受到模型投毒攻击，传统联邦遗忘假设客户端可信且合作，但面对恶意和可能共谋的客户端时，现有方法无法有效工作。

Method: 基于最后一轮训练中的客户端权重，识别并抑制恶意客户端与良性客户端更新差异最大的高幅度权重连接，通过精心选择和归零这些权重来隔离恶意影响。

Result: 在IID和非IID数据、标签翻转和后门攻击等多种场景下，FedUP能有效降低恶意数据准确率至重新训练模型水平，同时保持良性数据性能，比现有方法更快且节省存储。

Conclusion: FedUP提供了一种高效、鲁棒的解决方案，能够在强对抗威胁模型下有效应对恶意客户端，为联邦学习安全提供了实用的防御机制。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) can be vulnerable to attacks, such as model
poisoning, where adversaries send malicious local weights to compromise the
global model. Federated Unlearning (FU) is emerging as a solution to address
such vulnerabilities by selectively removing the influence of detected
malicious contributors on the global model without complete retraining.
However, unlike typical FU scenarios where clients are trusted and cooperative,
applying FU with malicious and possibly colluding clients is challenging
because their collaboration in unlearning their data cannot be assumed. This
work presents FedUP, a lightweight FU algorithm designed to efficiently
mitigate malicious clients' influence by pruning specific connections within
the attacked model. Our approach achieves efficiency by relying only on
clients' weights from the last training round before unlearning to identify
which connections to inhibit. Isolating malicious influence is non-trivial due
to overlapping updates from benign and malicious clients. FedUP addresses this
by carefully selecting and zeroing the highest magnitude weights that diverge
the most between the latest updates from benign and malicious clients while
preserving benign information. FedUP is evaluated under a strong adversarial
threat model, where up to 50%-1 of the clients could be malicious and have full
knowledge of the aggregation process. We demonstrate the effectiveness,
robustness, and efficiency of our solution through experiments across IID and
Non-IID data, under label-flipping and backdoor attacks, and by comparing it
with state-of-the-art (SOTA) FU solutions. In all scenarios, FedUP reduces
malicious influence, lowering accuracy on malicious data to match that of a
model retrained from scratch while preserving performance on benign data. FedUP
achieves effective unlearning while consistently being faster and saving
storage compared to the SOTA.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of authentication systems and their increasing reliance
on biometrics for faster and more accurate user verification experience,
highlight the critical need for a reliable framework to evaluate the
suitability of biometric modalities for specific applications. Currently, the
most widely known evaluation framework is a comparative table from 1998, which
no longer adequately captures recent technological developments or emerging
vulnerabilities in biometric systems. To address these challenges, this work
revisits the evaluation of biometric modalities through an expert survey
involving 24 biometric specialists. The findings indicate substantial shifts in
property ratings across modalities. For example, face recognition, shows
improved ratings due to technological progress, while fingerprint, shows
decreased reliability because of emerging vulnerabilities and attacks. Further
analysis of expert agreement levels across rated properties highlighted the
consistency of the provided evaluations and ensured the reliability of the
ratings. Finally, expert assessments are compared with dataset-level
uncertainty across 55 biometric datasets, revealing strong alignment in most
modalities and underscoring the importance of integrating empirical evidence
with expert insight. Moreover, the identified expert disagreements reveal key
open challenges and help guide future research toward resolving them.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fisher-Orthogonal Projection (FOP) 是一种新技术，通过利用两个子批次的梯度构建方差感知更新方向，在大批量训练中恢复二阶方法的有效性，实现更好的泛化和更快收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代GPU支持大批量训练（数万个样本），但现有优化器在大批量下表现不佳：一阶方法因梯度噪声减少而难以逃离次优极小值，二阶方法（如KFAC）需要过高阻尼而失去曲率信息优势。

Method: FOP方法利用两个子批次的梯度，在Fisher度量下将梯度差异的正交分量增强到平均梯度中，构建方差感知的更新方向。

Result: FOP技术能够在大批量训练中恢复二阶方法的有效性，实现可扩展的训练，具有改进的泛化能力和更快的收敛速度。

Conclusion: FOP是一种创新的技术解决方案，解决了大批量训练中优化器性能下降的问题，使二阶方法在大批量设置下重新发挥优势。

Abstract: Modern GPUs are equipped with large amounts of high-bandwidth memory,
enabling them to support mini-batch sizes of up to tens of thousands of
training samples. However, most existing optimizers struggle to perform
effectively at such a large batch size. As batch size increases, gradient noise
decreases due to averaging over many samples, limiting the ability of
first-order methods to escape sharp or suboptimal minima and reach the global
minimum. Meanwhile, second-order methods like the natural gradient with
Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (KFAC) often require excessively high
damping to remain stable at large batch sizes. This high damping effectively
washes out the curvature information that gives these methods their advantage,
reducing their performance to that of simple gradient descent. In this paper,
we introduce Fisher-Orthogonal Projection (FOP), a novel technique that
restores the effectiveness of the second-order method at very large batch
sizes, enabling scalable training with improved generalization and faster
convergence. FOP constructs a variance-aware update direction by leveraging
gradients from two sub-batches, enhancing the average gradient with a component
of the gradient difference that is orthogonal to the average under the
Fisher-metric.

TL;DR: 提出了One-Step Flow Q-Learning (OFQL)方法，通过Flow Matching框架实现单步动作生成，解决了Diffusion Q-Learning中多步去噪的效率问题，在保持性能的同时大幅减少了训练和推理时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Q-Learning (DQL)虽然性能优异，但在实际应用中受到多步去噪的限制，训练和推理效率低下。单步去噪虽然理想，但直接应用会导致性能急剧下降。

Method: 将DQL重新表述在Flow Matching框架中，学习平均速度场而不是传统的弯曲生成轨迹，从而实现直接准确的动作生成，无需辅助模型、蒸馏或多阶段训练。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试中，OFQL超越了DQL和其他基于扩散的基线方法，同时相比DQL大幅减少了训练和推理时间。

Conclusion: OFQL成功解决了DQL的效率瓶颈，实现了高效的单步动作生成，为强化学习中的生成模型提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: The generative power of diffusion models (DMs) has recently enabled
high-performing decision-making algorithms in offline reinforcement learning
(RL), achieving state-of-the-art results across standard benchmarks. Among
them, Diffusion Q-Learning (DQL) stands out as a leading method for its
consistently strong performance. Nevertheless, DQL remains limited in practice
due to its reliance on multi-step denoising for action generation during both
training and inference. Although one-step denoising is desirable, simply
applying it to DQL leads to a drastic performance drop. In this work, we
revisit DQL and identify its core limitations. We then propose One-Step Flow
Q-Learning (OFQL), a novel framework that enables efficient one-step action
generation during both training and inference, without requiring auxiliary
models, distillation, or multi-phase training. Specifically, OFQL reformulates
DQL within the sample-efficient Flow Matching (FM) framework. While
conventional FM induces curved generative trajectories that impede one-step
generation, OFQL instead learns an average velocity field that facilitates
direct, accurate action generation. Collectively, OFQL eliminates the need for
multi-step sampling and recursive gradient updates in DQL, resulting in faster
and more robust training and inference. Extensive experiments on the D4RL
benchmark demonstrate that OFQL outperforms DQL and other diffusion-based
baselines, while substantially reducing both training and inference time
compared to DQL.

Abstract: Extreme weather events, intensified by climate change, increasingly challenge
aging combined sewer systems, raising the risk of untreated wastewater
overflow. Accurate forecasting of sewer overflow basin filling levels can
provide actionable insights for early intervention, helping mitigating
uncontrolled discharge. In recent years, AI-based forecasting methods have
offered scalable alternatives to traditional physics-based models, but their
reliance on cloud computing limits their reliability during communication
outages. To address this, we propose an end-to-end forecasting framework that
enables energy-efficient inference directly on edge devices. Our solution
integrates lightweight Transformer and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models,
compressed via integer-only quantization for efficient on-device execution.
Moreover, an automated hardware-aware deployment pipeline is used to search for
optimal model configurations by jointly minimizing prediction error and energy
consumption on an AMD Spartan-7 XC7S15 FPGA. Evaluated on real-world sewer
data, the selected 8-bit Transformer model, trained on 24 hours of historical
measurements, achieves high accuracy (MSE 0.0376) at an energy cost of 0.370 mJ
per inference. In contrast, the optimal 8-bit LSTM model requires significantly
less energy (0.009 mJ, over 40x lower) but yields 14.89% worse accuracy (MSE
0.0432) and much longer training time. This trade-off highlights the need to
align model selection with deployment priorities, favoring LSTM for ultra-low
energy consumption or Transformer for higher predictive accuracy. In general,
our work enables local, energy-efficient forecasting, contributing to more
resilient combined sewer systems. All code can be found in the GitHub

TL;DR: 本文提出使用分类分布替代高斯分布来表示多模态策略，通过中间分类分布选择行为模式，在连续控制任务中实现更好的探索和更快的收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的深度强化学习策略通常使用高斯分布参数化，限制了学习到的行为只能是单模态的。然而许多实际决策问题需要多模态策略来促进环境探索，特别是在稀疏奖励、复杂动态或需要适应不同情境的场景中。

Method: 引入分类策略来建模多模态行为模式，使用中间分类分布生成条件输出动作。探索了两种采样方案，确保可微分离散潜在结构的同时保持高效的基于梯度的优化。通过潜在分类分布选择行为模式，自然表达多模态性。

Result: 在DeepMind Control Suite环境上的评估表明，通过更好的探索，学习到的策略收敛更快且优于标准高斯策略。

Conclusion: 分类分布是连续控制中结构化探索和多模态行为表示的有力工具。

Abstract: A policy in deep reinforcement learning (RL), either deterministic or
stochastic, is commonly parameterized as a Gaussian distribution alone,
limiting the learned behavior to be unimodal. However, the nature of many
practical decision-making problems favors a multimodal policy that facilitates
robust exploration of the environment and thus to address learning challenges
arising from sparse rewards, complex dynamics, or the need for strategic
adaptation to varying contexts. This issue is exacerbated in continuous control
domains where exploration usually takes place in the vicinity of the predicted
optimal action, either through an additive Gaussian noise or the sampling
process of a stochastic policy. In this paper, we introduce Categorical
Policies to model multimodal behavior modes with an intermediate categorical
distribution, and then generate output action that is conditioned on the
sampled mode. We explore two sampling schemes that ensure differentiable
discrete latent structure while maintaining efficient gradient-based
optimization. By utilizing a latent categorical distribution to select the
behavior mode, our approach naturally expresses multimodality while remaining
fully differentiable via the sampling tricks. We evaluate our multimodal policy
on a set of DeepMind Control Suite environments, demonstrating that through
better exploration, our learned policies converge faster and outperform
standard Gaussian policies. Our results indicate that the Categorical
distribution serves as a powerful tool for structured exploration and
multimodal behavior representation in continuous control.

Motivation: 调查现有自动特征工程方法的实际可用性，因为手动特征工程耗时耗力，而自动化方法的实际应用情况尚未被全面评估

Method: 调研了53种自动特征工程方法，分析其使用性、文档质量、社区活跃度以及是否支持时间和内存约束设置

Result: 发现现有方法普遍难以使用，文档缺乏，没有活跃社区，且没有方法支持用户设置运行时间和内存限制

Conclusion: 自动特征工程领域需要更具有实用性、工程化设计的方法，特别是支持资源约束设置的解决方案

Abstract: Tabular data, consisting of rows and columns, is omnipresent across various
machine learning applications. Each column represents a feature, and features
can be combined or transformed to create new, more informative features. Such
feature engineering is essential to achieve peak performance in machine
learning. Since manual feature engineering is expensive and time-consuming, a
substantial effort has been put into automating it. Yet, existing automated
feature engineering (AutoFE) methods have never been investigated regarding
their usability for practitioners. Thus, we investigated 53 AutoFE methods. We
found that these methods are, in general, hard to use, lack documentation, and
have no active communities. Furthermore, no method allows users to set time and
memory constraints, which we see as a necessity for usable automation. Our
survey highlights the need for future work on usable, well-engineered AutoFE
methods.

Abstract: In this paper we propose two algorithms in the tabular setting and an
algorithm for the function approximation setting for the Stochastic Shortest
Path (SSP) problem. SSP problems form an important class of problems in
Reinforcement Learning (RL), as other types of cost-criteria in RL can be
formulated in the setting of SSP. We show asymptotic almost-sure convergence
for all our algorithms. We observe superior performance of our tabular
algorithms compared to other well-known convergent RL algorithms. We further
observe reliable performance of our function approximation algorithm compared
to other algorithms in the function approximation setting.

TL;DR: AutoScale是一个无需昂贵权重搜索的两阶段框架，利用多任务优化指标自动选择线性标量化权重，在多个数据集上展现出优越性能和高效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管研究表明精心选择的固定任务权重在线性标量化中能取得与复杂多任务优化方法相当甚至更好的性能，但最优权重的选择原理和确定方法仍不明确，需要避免耗尽的超参数搜索

Method: 通过建立线性标量化与多任务优化方法的直接联系，发现性能良好的标量化权重在关键MTO指标（如高梯度幅度相似性）上表现出特定趋势，基于此提出了AutoScale两阶段框架，利用MTO指标指导权重选择

Result: AutoScale在包括新的大规模基准测试在内的多样化数据集上始终展现出优越的性能和高效率

Conclusion: AutoScale提供了一个简单而有效的解决方案，通过利用多任务优化指标来指导线性标量化的权重选择，避免了昂贵的权重搜索过程，实现了高性能和高效率的平衡

Abstract: Recent multi-task learning studies suggest that linear scalarization, when
using well-chosen fixed task weights, can achieve comparable to or even better
performance than complex multi-task optimization (MTO) methods. It remains
unclear why certain weights yield optimal performance and how to determine
these weights without relying on exhaustive hyperparameter search. This paper
establishes a direct connection between linear scalarization and MTO methods,
revealing through extensive experiments that well-performing scalarization
weights exhibit specific trends in key MTO metrics, such as high gradient
magnitude similarity. Building on this insight, we introduce AutoScale, a
simple yet effective two-phase framework that uses these MTO metrics to guide
weight selection for linear scalarization, without expensive weight search.
AutoScale consistently shows superior performance with high efficiency across
diverse datasets including a new large-scale benchmark.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了多用户上下文级联赌博机模型，结合级联反馈、并行上下文会话和异质奖励，设计了UCBBP和AUCBBP算法，在理论和实验上验证了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上下文赌博机无法捕捉在线广告中多用户同时与顺序展示物品交互的现实场景，需要新的组合框架来整合级联反馈、并行会话和异质奖励结构。

Method: 设计了UCBBP（上置信界后向规划）算法和AUCBBP（主动上置信界后向规划）算法，前者采用UCB风格，后者针对多用户同时交互场景优化上下文缩放效率。

Result: UCBBP达到遗憾界O~(√THN)，AUCBBP实现更优的上下文缩放效率，遗憾界为O~(√T+HN)，数值实验验证了两种算法的有效性。

Conclusion: MCCB框架成功建模了多用户在线交互场景，提出的算法在理论和实证上都表现出色，AUCBBP在多用户扩展性方面具有明显优势。

Abstract: We introduce a Multi-User Contextual Cascading Bandit model, a new
combinatorial bandit framework that captures realistic online advertising
scenarios where multiple users interact with sequentially displayed items
simultaneously. Unlike classical contextual bandits, MCCB integrates three key
structural elements: (i) cascading feedback based on sequential arm exposure,
(ii) parallel context sessions enabling selective exploration, and (iii)
heterogeneous arm-level rewards. We first propose Upper Confidence Bound with
Backward Planning (UCBBP), a UCB-style algorithm tailored to this setting, and
prove that it achieves a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{THN})$ over $T$
episodes, $H$ session steps, and $N$ contexts per episode. Motivated by the
fact that many users interact with the system simultaneously, we introduce a
second algorithm, termed Active Upper Confidence Bound with Backward Planning
(AUCBBP), which shows a strict efficiency improvement in context scaling, i.e.,
user scaling, with a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T+HN})$. We validate
our theoretical findings via numerical experiments, demonstrating the empirical
effectiveness of both algorithms under various settings.

TL;DR: KMR框架是一个统一的深度学习模型效率优化形式化框架，将剪枝、量化、知识蒸馏等方法抽象为可控旋钮、确定性规则和可测量仪表的三元组表示，支持系统化组合和预算优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型效率优化方法多样但缺乏统一的形式化表示，难以系统组合和理论分析，需要建立统一的数学框架来整合各种效率技术。

Method: 提出KMR三元组框架（Knob-Meter-Rule），将效率技术抽象为可控参数（Knob）、测量指标（Meter）和优化规则（Rule），并开发Budgeted-KMR算法进行迭代预算优化。

Result: 成功将主流效率方法实例化为KMR三元组，提供了简洁的算法模板，揭示了方法间的内在联系，支持混合管道构建。

Conclusion: KMR框架为模型效率研究提供了概念性和实用性的统一工具，为自动化策略学习、动态适应和理论分析奠定了基础。

Abstract: We introduce the Knob-Meter-Rule (KMR) framework, a unified formalism for
representing and reasoning about model efficiency techniques in deep learning.
By abstracting diverse methods, including pruning, quantization, knowledge
distillation, and parameter-efficient architectures, into a consistent set of
controllable knobs, deterministic rules, and measurable meters, KMR provides a
mathematically precise and modular perspective on efficiency optimization. The
framework enables systematic composition of multiple techniques, flexible
policy-driven application, and iterative budgeted optimization through the
Budgeted-KMR algorithm. We demonstrate how well-known efficiency methods can be
instantiated as KMR triples and present concise algorithmic templates for each.
The framework highlights underlying relationships between methods, facilitates
hybrid pipelines, and lays the foundation for future research in automated
policy learning, dynamic adaptation, and theoretical analysis of cost-quality
trade-offs. Overall, KMR offers both a conceptual and practical tool for
unifying and advancing model efficiency research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种可微分的量化方法，通过学习比特宽度、噪声缩放和限定边界来解决量化瓶颈问题，在极端低比特宽度下仍能保持竞争性的准确度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化神经网络中的四舍六入操作会降低每个层的信道容量，形成量化瓶颈，需要找到有效的方法来缓解这些问题以在低比特宽度下保持网络性能。

Method: 使用全可微分的直通估计器(STE)，并在其中引入可学习的比特宽度、噪声缩放和限定边界参数，通过外点罚函数来约束目标比特宽度，以及通过矩阵蒸馏来平滑指标稳定训练。

Result: 该方法在极端的W1A1设置下仍能达到竞争性的准确度，同时保留了STE方法的高效性。

Conclusion: 虽然简单，但这种可微分量化方法能够有效地解决量化瓶颈问题，在极低比特宽度下保持良好性能，为高效量化提供了一种可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Quantized neural networks can be viewed as a chain of noisy channels, where
rounding in each layer reduces capacity as bit-width shrinks; the
floating-point (FP) checkpoint sets the maximum input rate. We track capacity
dynamics as the average bit-width decreases and identify resulting quantization
bottlenecks by casting fine-tuning as a smooth, constrained optimization
problem. Our approach employs a fully differentiable Straight-Through Estimator
(STE) with learnable bit-width, noise scale and clamp bounds, and enforces a
target bit-width via an exterior-point penalty; mild metric smoothing (via
distillation) stabilizes training. Despite its simplicity, the method attains
competitive accuracy down to the extreme W1A1 setting while retaining the
efficiency of STE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自闭症谱系障碍(ASD)与大脑连接性异常相关，需要有效的方法来捕捉功能社区内外的连接模式，以改善ASD诊断和生物标志物发现。

Method: 提出ASDFormer架构，整合多头注意力机制和混合专家池化分类器，自适应地强调与自闭症相关的大脑区域和连接模式。

Result: 在ABIDE数据集上达到最先进的诊断准确率，并揭示了与ASD相关的功能连接中断的稳健见解。

Conclusion: ASDFormer在ASD诊断和生物标志物发现方面显示出巨大潜力，能够提供改进的分类性能和可解释的生物标志物识别。

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition
marked by disruptions in brain connectivity. Functional MRI (fMRI) offers a
non-invasive window into large-scale neural dynamics by measuring
blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals across the brain. These signals can
be modeled as interactions among Regions of Interest (ROIs), which are grouped
into functional communities based on their underlying roles in brain function.
Emerging evidence suggests that connectivity patterns within and between these
communities are particularly sensitive to ASD-related alterations. Effectively
capturing these patterns and identifying interactions that deviate from typical
development is essential for improving ASD diagnosis and enabling biomarker
discovery. In this work, we introduce ASDFormer, a Transformer-based
architecture that incorporates a Mixture of Pooling-Classifier Experts (MoE) to
capture neural signatures associated with ASD. By integrating multiple
specialized expert branches with attention mechanisms, ASDFormer adaptively
emphasizes different brain regions and connectivity patterns relevant to
autism. This enables both improved classification performance and more
interpretable identification of disorder-related biomarkers. Applied to the
ABIDE dataset, ASDFormer achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy and
reveals robust insights into functional connectivity disruptions linked to ASD,
highlighting its potential as a tool for biomarker discovery.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了类型化拓扑空间的新方法，通过为数据集定义特殊类型系统来探索数据内部结构，包括轨迹、组件和分支结构，为凸包、洞洞、聚类和异常检测等问题提供新算法平台。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对数据集的研究主要集中在统计方法和代数拓扑方法，需要从一般拓扑学视角提出新方法来研究有限拓扑空间。类型化拓扑空间的概念有潜力探索数据集的内部结构。

Method: 为数据集X开发一套特殊的类型系统和相关的类型化拓扑结构。利用R^2的自然商空间，将X组织成轨迹，每个轨迹分解为有序的组件，并用整数序列表示。跨越轨迹的组件形成分支，通过类型-II伪树表示关系。

Result: 构建了能够揭示数据集内部结构的类型化拓扑框架，包含轨迹组织、组件分解和分支结构。这些结构为多种数据分析问题提供了新的算法平台。

Conclusion: 类型化拓扑方法为研究有限拓扑空间（如数据集）提供了一种新的一般拓扑学视角，能够揭示数据的深层结构特征，为凸包计算、洞洞检测、聚类分析和异常检测等问题开发更有效的算法。

Abstract: A datatset $X$ on $R^2$ is a finite topological space. Current research of a
dataset focuses on statistical methods and the algebraic topological method
\cite{carlsson}. In \cite{hu}, the concept of typed topological space was
introduced and showed to have the potential for studying finite topological
spaces, such as a dataset. It is a new method from the general topology
perspective. A typed topological space is a topological space whose open sets
are assigned types. Topological concepts and methods can be redefined using
open sets of certain types. In this article, we develop a special set of types
and its related typed topology on a dataset $X$. Using it, we can investigate
the inner structure of $X$. In particular, $R^2$ has a natural quotient space,
in which $X$ is organized into tracks, and each track is split into components.
Those components are in a order. Further, they can be represented by an integer
sequence. Components crossing tracks form branches, and the relationship can be
well represented by a type of pseudotree (called typed-II pseudotree). Such
structures provide a platform for new algorithms for problems such as
calculating convex hull, holes, clustering and anomaly detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 满足"被忘记权"等法规要求，需要从模型中移除训练数据及其影响，但全量重新训练成本过高，而知识图的特殊结构和实体间语义关系使得谨忽学习更加复杂

Method: 定义知识图谨忽学习影响函数，使用泰勒展开估计数据删除导致的参数变化，通过Fisher矩阵和零阶优化接近逆黑塞矩阵向量乘积，避免计算一阶和二阶导数的高计算成本

Conclusion: 提出了一种高效的知识图谨忽学习算法，能够在不需要计算高成本导数的情况下实现大规模知识图的数据删除和模型更新，为满足数据隐私法规要求提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Due to regulations like the Right to be Forgotten, there is growing demand
for removing training data and its influence from models. Since full retraining
is costly, various machine unlearning methods have been proposed. In this
paper, we firstly present an efficient knowledge graph (KG) unlearning
algorithm. We remark that KG unlearning is nontrivial due to the distinctive
structure of KG and the semantic relations between entities. Also, unlearning
by estimating the influence of removed components incurs significant
computational overhead when applied to large-scale knowledge graphs. To this
end, we define an influence function for KG unlearning and propose to
approximate the model's sensitivity without expensive computation of
first-order and second-order derivatives for parameter updates. Specifically,
we use Taylor expansion to estimate the parameter changes caused by data
removal. Given that the first-order gradients and second-order derivatives
dominate the computational load, we use the Fisher matrices and zeroth-order
optimization to approximate the inverse-Hessian vector product without
constructing the computational graphs. Our experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art graph unlearning
baselines significantly in terms of unlearning efficiency and unlearning
quality. Our code is released at https://github.com/NKUShaw/ZOWFKGIF.

TL;DR: BLIPs是一种贝叶斯学习原子间势能框架，通过变分dropout提供校准的不确定性估计，在数据稀缺和分布外场景下提升MLIPs的预测准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习原子间势能(MLIPs)在分布外数据和数据稀缺场景下预测不准确，且缺乏不确定性估计，无法指导主动学习和确保模拟结果准确性。

Method: 提出BLIPs：基于变分dropout的可扩展、架构无关的贝叶斯框架，用于训练或微调MLIPs，提供能量和力的不确定性估计。

Result: 在计算化学任务中显示相比标准MLIPs有更好的预测准确性，特别是在数据稀缺和分布外场景下提供可信的不确定性估计，微调预训练模型也带来一致性能提升。

Conclusion: BLIPs框架成功解决了MLIPs的不确定性估计问题，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了模型在挑战性场景下的可靠性和准确性。

Abstract: Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) are becoming a central tool
in simulation-based chemistry. However, like most deep learning models, MLIPs
struggle to make accurate predictions on out-of-distribution data or when
trained in a data-scarce regime, both common scenarios in simulation-based
chemistry. Moreover, MLIPs do not provide uncertainty estimates by
construction, which are fundamental to guide active learning pipelines and to
ensure the accuracy of simulation results compared to quantum calculations. To
address this shortcoming, we propose BLIPs: Bayesian Learned Interatomic
Potentials. BLIP is a scalable, architecture-agnostic variational Bayesian
framework for training or fine-tuning MLIPs, built on an adaptive version of
Variational Dropout. BLIP delivers well-calibrated uncertainty estimates and
minimal computational overhead for energy and forces prediction at inference
time, while integrating seamlessly with (equivariant) message-passing
architectures. Empirical results on simulation-based computational chemistry
tasks demonstrate improved predictive accuracy with respect to standard MLIPs,
and trustworthy uncertainty estimates, especially in data-scarse or heavy
out-of-distribution regimes. Moreover, fine-tuning pretrained MLIPs with BLIP
yields consistent performance gains and calibrated uncertainties.

Motivation: 强化学习中复杂任务难以指定好的奖励函数，现有方法结合偏好和演示数据的方式往往不够灵活或难以扩展

Method: 提出了reward-rational partial orderings框架，开发了LEOPARD算法，能够从多种反馈类型（包括负面演示）中学习奖励函数

Result: 在有限偏好和演示反馈下，LEOPARD显著优于现有基线方法，结合多种反馈类型通常比单一反馈更有效

Conclusion: LEOPARD提供了一个灵活可扩展的框架，能够有效利用多种人类反馈类型来学习复杂的奖励函数

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is a general method for learning in sequential
settings, but it can often be difficult to specify a good reward function when
the task is complex. In these cases, preference feedback or expert
demonstrations can be used instead. However, existing approaches utilising both
together are often ad-hoc, rely on domain-specific properties, or won't scale.
We develop a new framing for learning from human data, \emph{reward-rational
partial orderings over observations}, designed to be flexible and scalable.
Based on this we introduce a practical algorithm, LEOPARD: Learning Estimated
Objectives from Preferences And Ranked Demonstrations. LEOPARD can learn from a
broad range of data, including negative demonstrations, to efficiently learn
reward functions across a wide range of domains. We find that when a limited
amount of preference and demonstration feedback is available, LEOPARD
outperforms existing baselines by a significant margin. Furthermore, we use
LEOPARD to investigate learning from many types of feedback compared to just a
single one, and find that combining feedback types is often beneficial.

TL;DR: 本文分析了行为方法和机制方法在测量目标导向性时面临的技术和概念问题，得出了目标导向性无法客观测量的结论，并提出了将目标导向性建模为动态多智能体系统涌现特性的新方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究复杂智能体行为预测的关键在于目标归因，但现有的行为观察和内部状态探测两种方法都存在根本性问题，需要重新审视目标导向性的测量问题。

Method: 通过分析行为方法和机制方法的基本假设，识别这两种方法在形式化智能体系统目标时遇到的技术和概念问题。

Result: 发现目标导向性无法被客观测量，因为测量过程本身受到观察者主观框架的影响，无法获得独立于观察者的客观测量结果。

Conclusion: 需要将目标导向性重新概念化为动态多智能体系统的涌现特性，而不是智能体的固有属性，这为未来的研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Our ability to predict the behavior of complex agents turns on the
attribution of goals. Probing for goal-directed behavior comes in two flavors:
Behavioral and mechanistic. The former proposes that goal-directedness can be
estimated through behavioral observation, whereas the latter attempts to probe
for goals in internal model states. We work through the assumptions behind both
approaches, identifying technical and conceptual problems that arise from
formalizing goals in agent systems. We arrive at the perhaps surprising
position that goal-directedness cannot be measured objectively. We outline new
directions for modeling goal-directedness as an emergent property of dynamic,
multi-agent systems.

Motivation: 现实企业环境中业务工作流通常由众多子流程模块化和复用组成，形成具有长而深度嵌套执行路径的复杂工作流，这种复杂性对LLM驱动的编排提出了重大挑战

Method: SOAN框架通过增量式构建形式化代理网络，识别和封装结构单元作为独立代理，增强编排的模块化和清晰度

Result: 在多个基准测试和真实企业工作流数据集上的评估显示，SOAN在适应性、容错性和执行效率方面显著优于最先进方法

Conclusion: SOAN框架为解决多层嵌套复杂工作流的可控结构编排提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Recent multi-agent frameworks built upon large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex task planning. However, in
real-world enterprise environments, business workflows are typically composed
through modularization and reuse of numerous subprocesses, resulting in
intricate workflows characterized by lengthy and deeply nested execution paths.
Such complexity poses significant challenges for LLM-driven orchestration, as
extended reasoning chains and state-space explosions severely impact planning
effectiveness and the proper sequencing of tool invocations. Therefore,
developing an orchestration method with controllable structures capable of
handling multi-layer nesting becomes a critical issue. To address this, we
propose a novel structure-driven orchestration framework Self-Organizing Agent
Network (SOAN). SOAN incrementally builds a formalized agent network by
identifying and encapsulating structural units as independent agents, enhancing
modularity and clarity in orchestration. Extensive evaluations were performed
using multiple benchmarks as well as a real-world enterprise workflow dataset.
Experimental results demonstrate that SOAN significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of adaptability, fault tolerance, and
execution efficiency.

Conclusion: 区块链与LaMAS的深度整合可为建立弹性、可信豖和可持续激励的数字生态系统奠定基础，BetaWeb框架有助于实现跨域自治段体的大规模协同作业

Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
propelled the development of artificial intelligence (AI) agents, which are
increasingly evolving into diverse autonomous entities, advancing the LLM-based
multi-agent systems (LaMAS). However, current agentic ecosystems remain
fragmented and closed. Establishing an interconnected and scalable paradigm for
Agentic AI has become a critical prerequisite. Although Agentic Web proposes an
open architecture to break the ecosystem barriers, its implementation still
faces core challenges such as privacy protection, data management, and value
measurement. Existing centralized or semi-centralized paradigms suffer from
inherent limitations, making them inadequate for supporting large-scale,
heterogeneous, and cross-domain autonomous interactions. To address these
challenges, this paper introduces the blockchain-enabled trustworthy Agentic
Web (BetaWeb). By leveraging the inherent strengths of blockchain, BetaWeb not
only offers a trustworthy and scalable infrastructure for LaMAS but also has
the potential to advance the Web paradigm from Web3 (centered on data
ownership) towards Web3.5, which emphasizes ownership of agent capabilities and
the monetization of intelligence. Beyond a systematic examination of the
BetaWeb framework, this paper presents a five-stage evolutionary roadmap,
outlining the path of LaMAS from passive execution to advanced collaboration
and autonomous governance. We also conduct a comparative analysis of existing
products and discuss key challenges of BetaWeb from multiple perspectives.
Ultimately, we argue that deep integration between blockchain and LaMAS can lay
the foundation for a resilient, trustworthy, and sustainably incentivized
digital ecosystem. A summary of the enabling technologies for each stage is
available at https://github.com/MatZaharia/BetaWeb.

Conclusion: COCO框架有效解决了多智能体系统中的错误传播问题，在保证效率的同时显著提升了工作流可靠性。

Abstract: Large-scale multi-agent workflows exhibit inherent vulnerability to error
propagation and quality degradation, where downstream agents compound upstream
failures without corrective mechanisms. We introduce COCO (Cognitive Operating
System with Continuous Oversight), a theoretically-grounded framework that
implements asynchronous self-monitoring and adaptive error correction in
multi-agent driven systems. COCO addresses the fundamental trade-off between
quality assurance and computational efficiency through a novel decoupled
architecture that separates error detection from the critical execution path,
achieving $O(1)$ monitoring overhead relative to workflow complexity. COCO
employs three key algorithmic innovations to address systematic and stochastic
errors: (1) Contextual Rollback Mechanism - a stateful restart protocol that
preserves execution history and error diagnostics, enabling informed
re-computation rather than naive retry; (2) Bidirectional Reflection Protocol -
a mutual validation system between monitoring and execution modules that
prevents oscillatory behavior and ensures convergence; (3) Heterogeneous
Cross-Validation - leveraging model diversity to detect systematic biases and
hallucinations through ensemble disagreement metrics. Extensive experiments on
benchmark multi-agent tasks demonstrate 6.5\% average performance improvement,
establishing new state-of-the-art for autonomous workflow reliability.

TL;DR: 本文研究了多阶段图上的公平分配问题，提出了C-Balance和DC-Balance算法来解决最小化嫉妒值的问题，并在理论分析和实验验证中展示了算法的有效性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多阶段图中，最小化总成本的最优分配可能导致严重的成本差异和嫉妒问题，需要设计公平的分配算法来平衡效率和公平性。

Method: 提出了C-Balance算法（针对两个代理）和DC-Balance算法（针对n个代理），通过迭代平衡路径成本来最小化嫉妒值，并保证计算效率。

Result: C-Balance算法将嫉妒值限制在2M以内（M为最大边权重），成本公平比（CoF）限制在2以内；DC-Balance算法可将嫉妒值任意接近2M，且在实验中运行速度比ILP快几个数量级。

Conclusion: 所提出的算法能有效解决多阶段图中的公平分配问题，在保证较低嫉妒值的同时维持合理的计算成本，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper explores the problem of fair assignment on Multi-Stage graphs. A
multi-stage graph consists of nodes partitioned into $K$ disjoint sets (stages)
structured as a sequence of weighted bipartite graphs formed across adjacent
stages. The goal is to assign node-disjoint paths to $n$ agents starting from
the first stage and ending in the last stage. We show that an efficient
assignment that minimizes the overall sum of costs of all the agents' paths may
be highly unfair and lead to significant cost disparities (envy) among the
agents. We further show that finding an envy-minimizing assignment on a
multi-stage graph is NP-hard. We propose the C-Balance algorithm, which
guarantees envy that is bounded by $2M$ in the case of two agents, where $M$ is
the maximum edge weight. We demonstrate the algorithm's tightness by presenting
an instance where the envy is $2M$. We further show that the cost of fairness
($CoF$), defined as the ratio of the cost of the assignment given by the fair
algorithm to that of the minimum cost assignment, is bounded by $2$ for
C-Balance. We then extend this approach to $n$ agents by proposing the
DC-Balance algorithm that makes iterative calls to C-Balance. We show the
convergence of DC-Balance, resulting in envy that is arbitrarily close to $2M$.
We derive $CoF$ bounds for DC-Balance and provide insights about its dependency
on the instance-specific parameters and the desired degree of envy. We
experimentally show that our algorithm runs several orders of magnitude faster
than a suitably formulated ILP.

TL;DR: 提出了一种融合多种突触可塑性机制的生物启发式SNN训练框架，相比单一学习机制显著提升了性能和鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大脑中存在多种学习策略共存，但当前SNN训练方法通常只依赖单一形式的突触可塑性，限制了其适应性和表征能力

Method: 生物启发的训练框架，整合多种协同可塑性机制，使不同学习算法能够协作调节信息积累，同时保持各自相对独立的更新动态

Result: 在静态图像和动态神经形态数据集上的评估表明，该框架相比传统学习机制模型显著提升了性能和鲁棒性

Conclusion: 为开发基于多策略脑启发学习的更强大SNN提供了通用且可扩展的基础

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are promising brain-inspired models known for
low power consumption and superior potential for temporal processing, but
identifying suitable learning mechanisms remains a challenge. Despite the
presence of multiple coexisting learning strategies in the brain, current SNN
training methods typically rely on a single form of synaptic plasticity, which
limits their adaptability and representational capability. In this paper, we
propose a biologically inspired training framework that incorporates multiple
synergistic plasticity mechanisms for more effective SNN training. Our method
enables diverse learning algorithms to cooperatively modulate the accumulation
of information, while allowing each mechanism to preserve its own relatively
independent update dynamics. We evaluated our approach on both static image and
dynamic neuromorphic datasets to demonstrate that our framework significantly
improves performance and robustness compared to conventional learning mechanism
models. This work provides a general and extensible foundation for developing
more powerful SNNs guided by multi-strategy brain-inspired learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遗传编程在符号回归中会重复访问和评估搜索空间中的相同点，造成计算资源的浪费，需要一种机制来避免这种重复计算。

Method: 使用Zobrist哈希技术实现缓存机制，基于开源框架Operon进行实现，通过哈希表记录已评估的表达式以避免重复计算。

Result: 在真实世界回归问题上实现了高达34%的运行速度提升，且对搜索质量没有负面影响。

Conclusion: Zobrist哈希缓存机制是提高符号回归算法运行性能的有效方法，同时为基于缓存信息调整搜索策略提供了可能性。

Abstract: Symbolic regression encompasses a family of search algorithms that aim to
discover the best fitting function for a set of data without requiring an a
priori specification of the model structure. The most successful and commonly
used technique for symbolic regression is Genetic Programming (GP), an
evolutionary search method that evolves a population of mathematical
expressions through the mechanism of natural selection. In this work we analyze
the efficiency of the evolutionary search in GP and show that many points in
the search space are re-visited and re-evaluated multiple times by the
algorithm, leading to wasted computational effort. We address this issue by
introducing a caching mechanism based on the Zobrist hash, a type of hashing
frequently used in abstract board games for the efficient construction and
subsequent update of transposition tables. We implement our caching approach
using the open-source framework Operon and demonstrate its performance on a
selection of real-world regression problems, where we observe up to 34\%
speedups without any detrimental effects on search quality. The hashing
approach represents a straightforward way to improve runtime performance while
also offering some interesting possibilities for adjusting search strategy
based on cached information.

Motivation: 高保真个性化人体肌肉骨骼模型对于人机交互系统仿真和安全验证至关重要，但传统方法难以直接测量内部生物力学变量，特别是关节扭矩。

Method: 使用可微分肌肉骨骼模型(Diff-MSM)，通过端到端自动微分技术，从可测量的肌肉激活到关节扭矩再到可观测运动，同时识别肌肉和骨骼参数。

Result: 仿真结果显示该方法显著优于现有基线方法，肌肉参数估计误差低至0.05%（初始猜测从均值为真实值、标准差为真实值10%的正态分布中采样）。

Conclusion: Diff-MSM参数识别技术不仅在肌肉骨骼建模和仿真中有重要价值，在肌肉健康监测、康复和运动科学等领域也具有巨大应用潜力。

Abstract: High-fidelity personalized human musculoskeletal models are crucial for
simulating realistic behavior of physically coupled human-robot interactive
systems and verifying their safety-critical applications in simulations before
actual deployment, such as human-robot co-transportation and rehabilitation
through robotic exoskeletons. Identifying subject-specific Hill-type muscle
model parameters and bone dynamic parameters is essential for a personalized
musculoskeletal model, but very challenging due to the difficulty of measuring
the internal biomechanical variables in vivo directly, especially the joint
torques. In this paper, we propose using Differentiable MusculoSkeletal Model
(Diff-MSM) to simultaneously identify its muscle and bone parameters with an
end-to-end automatic differentiation technique differentiating from the
measurable muscle activation, through the joint torque, to the resulting
observable motion without the need to measure the internal joint torques.
Through extensive comparative simulations, the results manifested that our
proposed method significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art baseline
methods, especially in terms of accurate estimation of the muscle parameters
(i.e., initial guess sampled from a normal distribution with the mean being the
ground truth and the standard deviation being 10% of the ground truth could end
up with an average of the percentage errors of the estimated values as low as
0.05%). In addition to human musculoskeletal modeling and simulation, the new
parameter identification technique with the Diff-MSM has great potential to
enable new applications in muscle health monitoring, rehabilitation, and sports
science.

Abstract: We build a mobile surveillance robot that streams video in real time and
responds to speech so a user can monitor and steer it from a phone or browser.
The system uses two Raspberry Pi 4 units: a front unit on a differential drive
base with camera, mic, and speaker, and a central unit that serves the live
feed and runs perception. Video is sent with FFmpeg. Objects in the scene are
detected using YOLOv3 to support navigation and event awareness. For voice
interaction, we use Python libraries for speech recognition, multilingual
translation, and text-to-speech, so the robot can take spoken commands and read
back responses in the requested language. A Kinect RGB-D sensor provides visual
input and obstacle cues. In indoor tests the robot detects common objects at
interactive frame rates on CPU, recognises commands reliably, and translates
them to actions without manual control. The design relies on off-the-shelf
hardware and open software, making it easy to reproduce. We discuss limits and
practical extensions, including sensor fusion with ultrasonic range data, GPU
acceleration, and adding face and text recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂动力学环境下实时规划问题，传统Hybrid A*的网格分辨率选择困难：太粗可能导致失败，太细则导致扩展过多和规划缓慢。

Method: 提出IGHA*算法框架，采用增量式树搜索，动态组织顶点扩展而不依赖刚性剪枝机制，提供近似最优的实时规划能力。

Conclusion: IGHA*算法实现了复杂动力学下的快速鲁棒规划，在仿真和小型越野车辆上均展示了实时性能，为自动驾驶等应用提供了有效的实时规划解决方案。

Abstract: We address the problem of efficiently organizing search over very large
trees, which arises in many applications ranging from autonomous driving to
aerial vehicles. Here, we are motivated by off-road autonomy, where real-time
planning is essential. Classical approaches use graphs of motion primitives and
exploit dominance to mitigate the curse of dimensionality and prune expansions
efficiently. However, for complex dynamics, repeatedly solving two-point
boundary-value problems makes graph construction too slow for fast kinodynamic
planning. Hybrid A* (HA*) addressed this challenge by searching over a tree of
motion primitives and introducing approximate pruning using a grid-based
dominance check. However, choosing the grid resolution is difficult: too coarse
risks failure, while too fine leads to excessive expansions and slow planning.
We propose Incremental Generalized Hybrid A* (IGHA*), an anytime tree-search
framework that dynamically organizes vertex expansions without rigid pruning.
IGHA* provably matches or outperforms HA*. For both on-road kinematic and
off-road kinodynamic planning queries for a car-like robot, variants of IGHA*
use 6x fewer expansions to the best solution compared to an optimized version
of HA*. In simulated off-road experiments in a high fidelity simulator, IGHA*
outperforms HA*M when both are used in the loop with a model predictive
controller. We demonstrate real-time performance both in simulation and on a
small-scale off-road vehicle, enabling fast, robust planning under complex
dynamics. Code: https://github.com/personalrobotics/IGHAStar

TL;DR: 提出基于Benders分解的方法来解决双足机器人运动规划中的混合整数规划问题，通过将问题分解为主问题和子问题来降低计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双足机器人运动规划中的信号时序逻辑约束问题具有NP-hard复杂度，特别是引入非凸约束（如运动学可达性和脚步旋转）后，混合整数规划的计算复杂度进一步加剧，需要更高效的求解方法。

Method: 采用Benders分解方法，将整体优化问题分解为：主问题负责生成满足任务规范的计划原型，一系列子问题进行运动学和动力学可行性检查，通过迭代切割平面技术实现高效求解。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在处理非线性约束的优化程序时，相比其他算法能够实现更快的规划速度。

Conclusion: Benders分解方法有效解决了双足机器人运动规划中混合整数规划问题的计算复杂度问题，为处理复杂非凸约束提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Task and motion planning under Signal Temporal Logic constraints is known to
be NP-hard. A common class of approaches formulates these hybrid problems,
which involve discrete task scheduling and continuous motion planning, as
mixed-integer programs (MIP). However, in applications for bipedal locomotion,
introduction of non-convex constraints such as kinematic reachability and
footstep rotation exacerbates the computational complexity of MIPs. In this
work, we present a method based on Benders Decomposition to address scenarios
where solving the entire monolithic optimization problem is prohibitively
intractable. Benders Decomposition proposes an iterative cutting-plane
technique that partitions the problem into a master problem to prototype a plan
that meets the task specification, and a series of subproblems for kinematics
and dynamics feasibility checks. Our experiments demonstrate that this method
achieves faster planning compared to alternative algorithms for solving the
resulting optimization program with nonlinear constraints.

quantitative baseline for the robot's performance against a human player. In
the paper, we discuss these results, which demonstrate the feasibility of using
commercial games platform as physically grounded benchmarks and motivate future
work to for benchmarking embodied AI.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用视觉语言模型生成反事实标签来增强机器人数据集的方法，通过增加语言基础的多样性和细粒度，显著提升了视觉-语言-动作模型在导航任务中的指令遵循能力，成功率提高27%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用机器人需要理解并遵循用户指令，但当前的视觉-语言-动作模型在处理细粒度命令时存在困难，主要原因是现有机器人数据集缺乏语义多样性和语言基础，特别是相似观察条件下的细粒度任务多样性不足。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的数据增强方法，利用视觉语言模型为现有机器人数据集创建反事实标签，通过生成反事实语言和动作来增加语言基础的多样性和细粒度。

Result: 在3种不同室内外环境中的视觉语言导航实验表明，反事实重新标注方法无需额外数据收集，就能显著提升VLA策略的指令遵循能力，使其达到最先进方法的水平，导航任务成功率提高27%。

Conclusion: 通过反事实标签增强机器人数据集的方法有效解决了VLA模型在细粒度指令遵循方面的局限性，为提升通用机器人的语言理解能力提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Generalist robots should be able to understand and follow user instructions,
but current vision-language-action (VLA) models struggle with following
fine-grained commands despite providing a powerful architecture for mapping
open-vocabulary natural language instructions to robot actions. One cause for
this is a lack of semantic diversity and language grounding in existing robot
datasets and, specifically, a lack of fine-grained task diversity for similar
observations. To address this, we present a novel method to augment existing
robot datasets by leveraging vision language models to create counterfactual
labels. Our method improves the language-following capabilities of VLAs by
increasing the diversity and granularity of language grounding for robot
datasets by generating counterfactual language and actions. We evaluate the
resulting model's ability to follow language instructions, ranging from simple
object-centric commands to complex referential tasks, by conducting visual
language navigation experiments in 3 different indoor and outdoor environments.
Our experiments demonstrate that counterfactual relabeling, without any
additional data collection, significantly improves instruction-following in VLA
policies, making them competitive with state-of-the-art methods and increasing
success rate by 27% on navigation tasks.

Motivation: 社交迷你游戏（SMGs）作为多机器人导航中的关键挑战场景，现有研究存在假设不一致、目标函数不统一的问题，导致难以建立合适的基准比较，阻碍了研究发展和实践应用。

Method: 通过定义明确的统一分类法，对现有的SMG导航求解器进行系统分类和编目，建立标准化的评估协议和定义体系。

Result: 创建了首个针对SMG导航研究的系统性分类框架，为领域研究提供了统一的标准和指导。

Conclusion: SMG导航研究需要专门的分类法、定义和评估协议来推动有效研究，本综述为该领域建立了必要的基础框架。

Abstract: The ``Last Mile Challenge'' has long been considered an important, yet
unsolved, challenge for autonomous vehicles, public service robots, and
delivery robots. A central issue in this challenge is the ability of robots to
navigate constrained and cluttered environments (e.g., doorways, hallways,
corridor intersections), often while competing for space with other robots and
humans. We refer to these environments as ``Social Mini-Games'' (SMGs). SMGs
are tightly coupled, high-agency interactions that arise within general
multi-robot navigation (MRN) scenarios. They are identified through certain
distinct characteristics and require specialized metrics to evaluate them.
Traditional navigation approaches designed for MRN do not perform well in SMGs,
which has led to focused research on dedicated SMG solvers (navigation methods
specialized to navigate in SMGs), which has flourished in recent years.
However, publications on SMG navigation research make different assumptions (on
centralized versus decentralized, observability, communication, cooperation,
etc.), and have different objective functions (safety versus liveness). These
assumptions and objectives are sometimes implicitly assumed or described
informally. This makes it difficult to establish appropriate baselines for
comparison in research papers, as well as making it difficult for practitioners
to find the papers relevant to their concrete application. Such ad-hoc
representation of the field also presents a barrier to new researchers wanting
to start research in this area. SMG navigation research requires its own
taxonomy, definitions, and evaluation protocols to guide effective research
moving forward. This survey is the first to catalog SMG solvers using a
well-defined and unified taxonomy and to classify existing methods accordingly.

Conclusion: 该研究为全轮全向独立转向车辆提供了统一的运动模式定义和有效的鲁棒控制方法，实现了多运动模式间的无缝切换和高精度轨迹跟踪。

Abstract: An all-wheel omni-directional independent steering vehicle (AWOISV) is a
specialized all-wheel independent steering vehicle with each wheel capable of
steering up to 90{\deg}, enabling unique maneuvers like yaw and diagonal
movement. This paper introduces a theoretical steering radius angle and
sideslip angle (\( \theta_R \)-\(\beta_R \)) representation, based on the
position of the instantaneous center of rotation relative to the wheel rotation
center, defining the motion modes and switching criteria for AWOISVs. A
generalized \( v\)-\(\beta\)-\(r \) dynamic model is developed with forward
velocity \(v\), sideslip angle \(\beta\), and yaw rate \(r\) as states, and
\(\theta_R\) and \(\beta_R\) as control inputs. This model decouples
longitudinal and lateral motions into forward and rotational motions, allowing
seamless transitions across all motion modes under specific conditions. A
filtered tube-based linear time-varying MPC (FT-LTVMPC) strategy is proposed,
achieving simultaneous tracking of lateral position and arbitrary heading
angles, with robustness to model inaccuracies and parameter uncertainties.
Co-simulation and hardware-in-loop (HIL) experiments confirm that FT-LTVMPC
enables high-precision control of both position and heading while ensuring
excellent real-time performance.

Method: 提出ROVER方法，对每个闭环候选首先通过位姿图优化估计机器人轨迹，然后通过评分方案评估该轨迹与无闭环时的轨迹先验的一致性，从而决定是否接受该闭环

Result: 基准测试和真实世界实验证明了该方法的有效性，集成到最先进的SLAM系统中验证了其鲁棒性和效率

Conclusion: 利用轨迹先验约束可以有效拒绝重复环境中的错误闭环检测，提高SLAM系统的可靠性

Abstract: Loop closure detection is important for simultaneous localization and mapping
(SLAM), which associates current observations with historical keyframes,
achieving drift correction and global relocalization. However, a falsely
detected loop can be fatal, and this is especially difficult in repetitive
environments where appearance-based features fail due to the high similarity.
Therefore, verification of a loop closure is a critical step in avoiding false
positive detections. Existing works in loop closure verification predominantly
focus on learning invariant appearance features, neglecting the prior knowledge
of the robot's spatial-temporal motion cue, i.e., trajectory. In this letter,
we propose ROVER, a loop closure verification method that leverages the
historical trajectory as a prior constraint to reject false loops in
challenging repetitive environments. For each loop candidate, it is first used
to estimate the robot trajectory with pose-graph optimization. This trajectory
is then submitted to a scoring scheme that assesses its compliance with the
trajectory without the loop, which we refer to as the trajectory prior, to
determine if the loop candidate should be accepted. Benchmark comparisons and
real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
Furthermore, we integrate ROVER into state-of-the-art SLAM systems to verify
its robustness and efficiency. Our source code and self-collected dataset are
available at https://github.com/jarvisyjw/ROVER.

Motivation: 为了解决模块化机械臂在不同形态配置下的控制问题，避免控制器需要大量参数调整的复杂性

Method: 采用两层MPC结构：高层MPC预测未来状态并提供轨迹信息，低层MPC基于高层信息更新预测模型并细化控制动作，引入次级线性化技术捕捉运动学模型的二阶泰勒展开信息

Result: 该方法能够整合运动学约束，确保平滑的关节空间轨迹，即使在奇异配置附近也能保持良好性能，提高了控制精度和可靠性

Conclusion: H-MPC方法为模块化机械臂提供了一种统一且高效的控制框架，通过分层结构和次级线性化技术实现了简单性与准确性的平衡

Abstract: This work proposes a unified Hierarchical Model Predictive Control (H-MPC)
for modular manipulators across various morphologies, as the controller can
adapt to different configurations to execute the given task without extensive
parameter tuning in the controller. The H-MPC divides the control process into
two levels: a high-level MPC and a low-level MPC. The high-level MPC predicts
future states and provides trajectory information, while the low-level MPC
refines control actions by updating the predictive model based on this
high-level information. This hierarchical structure allows for the integration
of kinematic constraints and ensures smooth joint-space trajectories, even near
singular configurations. Moreover, the low-level MPC incorporates secondary
linearization by leveraging predictive information from the high-level MPC,
effectively capturing the second-order Taylor expansion information of the
kinematic model while still maintaining a linearized model formulation. This
approach not only preserves the simplicity of a linear control model but also
enhances the accuracy of the kinematic representation, thereby improving
overall control precision and reliability. To validate the effectiveness of the
control policy, we conduct extensive evaluations across different manipulator
morphologies and demonstrate the execution of pick-and-place tasks in
real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) community often highlights the social
context of an interaction as a key consideration when designing, implementing,
and evaluating robot behavior. Unfortunately, researchers use the term "social
context" in varied ways. This can lead to miscommunication, making it
challenging to draw connections between related work on understanding and
modeling the social contexts of human-robot interactions. To address this gap,
we survey the HRI literature for existing definitions and uses of the term
"social context". Then, we propose a conceptual model for describing the social
context of a human-robot interaction. We apply this model to existing work, and
we discuss a range of attributes of social contexts that can help researchers
plan for interactions, develop behavior models for robots, and gain insights
after interactions have taken place. We conclude with a discussion of open
research questions in relation to understanding and modeling the social
contexts of human-robot interactions.

Abstract: This paper presents a control framework designed to enhance the stability and
robustness of legged robots in the presence of uncertainties, including model
uncertainties, external disturbances, and faults. The framework enables the
full-state feedback estimator to estimate and compensate for uncertainties in
whole-body dynamics of the legged robots. First, we propose a novel moving
horizon extended state observer (MH-ESO) to estimate uncertainties and mitigate
noise in legged systems, which can be integrated into the framework for
disturbance compensation. Second, we introduce a three-level whole-body
disturbance rejection control framework (T-WB-DRC). Unlike the previous
two-level approach, this three-level framework considers both the plan based on
whole-body dynamics without uncertainties and the plan based on dynamics with
uncertainties, significantly improving payload transportation, external
disturbance rejection, and fault tolerance. Third, simulations of both humanoid
and quadruped robots in the Gazebo simulator demonstrate the effectiveness and
versatility of T-WB-DRC. Finally, extensive experimental trials on a quadruped
robot validate the robustness and stability of the system when using T-WB-DRC
under various disturbance conditions.

TL;DR: MimicFunc是一个通过功能帧建立功能对应关系来模仿工具操作技能的框架，能够从单个人类视频中学习并泛化到新工具的操作


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从人类视频中模仿工具操作为机器人教学提供了直观方法，但现有机器人难以实现人类级别的泛化能力，主要挑战在于处理功能相似工具之间的几何差异

Method: 提出MimicFunc框架，使用基于关键点的抽象构建功能中心局部坐标系（功能帧），建立功能级对应关系

Result: 实验表明MimicFunc能有效让机器人从单个RGB-D人类视频中学习技能，并泛化到操作新工具完成功能等效任务

Conclusion: 该方法不仅实现了单次泛化能力，还能利用生成的rollouts训练视觉运动策略，无需为每个新对象收集费力的遥操作数据

Abstract: Imitating tool manipulation from human videos offers an intuitive approach to
teaching robots, while also providing a promising and scalable alternative to
labor-intensive teleoperation data collection for visuomotor policy learning.
While humans can mimic tool manipulation behavior by observing others perform a
task just once and effortlessly transfer the skill to diverse tools for
functionally equivalent tasks, current robots struggle to achieve this level of
generalization. A key challenge lies in establishing function-level
correspondences, considering the significant geometric variations among
functionally similar tools, referred to as intra-function variations. To
address this challenge, we propose MimicFunc, a framework that establishes
functional correspondences with function frame, a function-centric local
coordinate frame constructed with keypoint-based abstraction, for imitating
tool manipulation skills. Experiments demonstrate that MimicFunc effectively
enables the robot to generalize the skill from a single RGB-D human video to
manipulating novel tools for functionally equivalent tasks. Furthermore,
leveraging MimicFunc's one-shot generalization capability, the generated
rollouts can be used to train visuomotor policies without requiring
labor-intensive teleoperation data collection for novel objects. Our code and
video are available at https://sites.google.com/view/mimicfunc.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 研究探讨了机器人类型和移动模式对分心和未分心行人行为的影响，发现分心状态对行人行为无显著差异，但机器人尺寸和移动模式显著影响行人的横向适应行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自主机器人在公共空间日益普及，需要开发能增强瞬时透明度和减少危急情况概率的通信策略，但目前对行人在自主机器人存在下的分心行为研究有限。

Method: 在实地环境中，对498名不知情的行人进行录像观察，记录他们经过两个工作中的自主清洁机器人时的行为，分析机器人类型（大小）和移动模式（矩形vs圆形）对分心和未分心行人运动行为的影响。

Result: 约8%的行人因智能手机分心，但分心与未分心行人在机器人周围的行为无显著差异。较大的扫地机器人和偏移矩形移动模式显著增加了横向适应次数，偏移矩形模式还导致更多近距离横向适应。不同机器人类型下移动模式对横向适应距离的影响存在差异。

Conclusion: 该研究为公共空间中自主清洁机器人周围行人运动行为提供了初步见解，表明机器人物理特征和移动模式比行人分心状态对行为适应的影响更大，为HRI研究领域做出了贡献。

Abstract: As autonomous robots become more common in public spaces, spontaneous
encounters with laypersons are more frequent. For this, robots need to be
equipped with communication strategies that enhance momentary transparency and
reduce the probability of critical situations. Adapting these robotic
strategies requires consideration of robot movements, environmental conditions,
and user characteristics and states. While numerous studies have investigated
the impact of distraction on pedestrians' movement behavior, limited research
has examined this behavior in the presence of autonomous robots. This research
addresses the impact of robot type and robot movement pattern on distracted and
undistracted pedestrians' movement behavior. In a field setting, unaware
pedestrians were videotaped while moving past two working, autonomous cleaning
robots. Out of N=498 observed pedestrians, approximately 8% were distracted by
smartphones. Distracted and undistracted pedestrians did not exhibit
significant differences in their movement behaviors around the robots. Instead,
both the larger sweeping robot and the offset rectangular movement pattern
significantly increased the number of lateral adaptations compared to the
smaller cleaning robot and the circular movement pattern. The offset
rectangular movement pattern also led to significantly more close lateral
adaptations. Depending on the robot type, the movement patterns led to
differences in the distances of lateral adaptations. The study provides initial
insights into pedestrian movement behavior around an autonomous cleaning robot
in public spaces, contributing to the growing field of HRI research.

TL;DR: 开发了DIPPeR自主矿山检测机器人，通过LiDAR点云处理实现爆破孔的自动检测和导航定位，用于地下材料类型和属性的调查。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 露天采矿中爆破孔的内部检测对于了解地下材料类型和属性至关重要，可以显著降低下游处理的物料处理成本。人工检测速度慢、成本高，且难以揭示孔的几何和地质特性。

Method: 使用LiDAR传感器收集点云数据，提取地面上的锥形钻屑体积。将3D锥形点投影到虚拟深度图像中，在2D域进行分割，得到图像中心的圆形孔和锥形面。通过鲁棒检测模块识别孔中心，抑制非最大候选点，确保传感器精确定位。

Result: 在高保真仿真环境和现场测试中证明了导航和感知系统的有效性。系统能够自动调整投影参数以适应点稀疏度和孔开口大小的变化，实现连续目标跟踪。

Conclusion: DIPPeR机器人系统成功实现了爆破孔的自动检测和精确定位，为矿山检测提供了高效、准确的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: In open-pit mining, holes are drilled into the surface of the excavation site
and detonated with explosives to facilitate digging. These blast holes need to
be inspected internally for investigation of downhole material types and
properties. Knowing these properties can lead to significant savings in
material handling costs in downstream processes. Manual hole inspection is slow
and expensive, with major limitations in revealing the geometric and geological
properties of the holes and their contents. This has been the motivation for
the development of our autonomous mine-site inspection robot - "DIPPeR". In
this paper, the automation aspect of the project is explained. We present a
robust blast hole seeking and detection framework that enables target-based
navigation and accurate down-hole sensor positioning. The pipeline first
processes point-cloud data collected by the on-board LiDAR sensors, extracting
the cone-shaped volume of drill-waste above the ground. By projecting the 3D
cone points into a virtual depth image, segmentation is achieved in the 2D
domain, yielding a circular hole at the image centre and a collared cone face.
We then identify the hole centre using a robust detection module while
suppressing non-maximum candidates, ensuring precise sensor placement for
down-hole inspection and avoiding collisions with the cavity wall. To enable
autonomous hole-seeking, the pipeline automatically adjusts its projection
parameters during robot navigation to account for variations in point sparsity
and hole opening size, ensuring a consistent hole appearance in 2D images. This
allows continuous tracking of the target hole as the robot approaches the goal
point. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our navigation and perception system
in both high-fidelity simulation environments and on-site field tests. A
demonstration video is available at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度Koopman算子和模型预测控制的数据驱动四旋翼控制框架(DK-MPC)，通过深度学习构建线性化动态模型，实现高效轨迹跟踪和稳定控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统非线性MPC计算复杂，难以满足四旋翼飞行器的实时控制需求，需要一种既能处理复杂非线性动态又能保证实时性能的控制方法。

Method: 使用深度Koopman算子从飞行数据中学习高维潜在表示，将非线性四旋翼动态近似为线性模型，然后应用MPC进行有限预测时域内的控制优化。

Result: 在轨迹跟踪和点稳定实验中，相比传统非线性MPC，DK-MPC表现出更优的跟踪精度和显著降低的计算时间。

Conclusion: Koopman学习方法能够有效处理复杂四旋翼动态并满足嵌入式飞行控制的实时要求，未来将扩展到更敏捷飞行场景和提升抗干扰鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven control framework for quadrotor systems
that integrates a deep Koopman operator with model predictive control (DK-MPC).
The deep Koopman operator is trained on sampled flight data to construct a
high-dimensional latent representation in which the nonlinear quadrotor
dynamics are approximated by linear models. This linearization enables the
application of MPC to efficiently optimize control actions over a finite
prediction horizon, ensuring accurate trajectory tracking and stabilization.
The proposed DK-MPC approach is validated through a series of
trajectory-following and point-stabilization numerical experiments, where it
demonstrates superior tracking accuracy and significantly lower computation
time compared to conventional nonlinear MPC. These results highlight the
potential of Koopman-based learning methods to handle complex quadrotor
dynamics while meeting the real-time requirements of embedded flight control.
Future work will focus on extending the framework to more agile flight
scenarios and improving robustness against external disturbances.

Motivation: 强化学习在机器人操作中数据密集且依赖MDP假设，难以处理复杂动态和长期时间依赖的多机器人操作任务。决策变换器作为离线替代方案，但在多机器人操作中的应用尚未充分探索

Method: SGDT框架包含神经符号规划器生成符号子目标的高层任务导向计划，以及目标条件决策变换器进行低层序列决策的层次化架构

Result: 在零样本和少样本场景等多种任务情境中评估SGDT性能，证明其在复杂多机器人协作任务中的有效性

Conclusion: 这是首个探索基于决策变换器技术用于多机器人操作的工作，SGDT框架实现了结构化、可解释和可泛化的决策制定

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated great potential in robotic
operations. However, its data-intensive nature and reliance on the Markov
Decision Process (MDP) assumption limit its practical deployment in real-world
scenarios involving complex dynamics and long-term temporal dependencies, such
as multi-robot manipulation. Decision Transformers (DTs) have emerged as a
promising offline alternative by leveraging causal transformers for sequence
modeling in RL tasks. However, their applications to multi-robot manipulations
still remain underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework,
Symbolically-Guided Decision Transformer (SGDT), which integrates a
neuro-symbolic mechanism with a causal transformer to enable deployable
multi-robot collaboration. In the proposed SGDT framework, a neuro-symbolic
planner generates a high-level task-oriented plan composed of symbolic
subgoals. Guided by these subgoals, a goal-conditioned decision transformer
(GCDT) performs low-level sequential decision-making for multi-robot
manipulation. This hierarchical architecture enables structured, interpretable,
and generalizable decision making in complex multi-robot collaboration tasks.
We evaluate the performance of SGDT across a range of task scenarios, including
zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
explore DT-based technology for multi-robot manipulation.

Motivation: 现有驾驶风格识别系统过度依赖低级传感器特征，缺乏人类专家的语义推理能力，导致算法分类与专家判断存在根本性不一致

Method: 开发DriBehavGPT模块生成自然语言行为描述，通过文本嵌入和降维转换为机器学习可用的表示，作为特权信息集成到SVM+中进行训练

Result: 在多种真实驾驶场景中，该框架显著优于传统方法，F1分数在跟车和变道场景分别提升7.6%和7.9%，且推理时仅需传感器数据

Conclusion: 语义行为表征在提高识别准确性的同时推动可解释、以人为本的驾驶系统发展，证明了语义特权信息的重要作用

Abstract: Existing driving style recognition systems largely depend on low-level
sensor-derived features for training, neglecting the rich semantic reasoning
capability inherent to human experts. This discrepancy results in a fundamental
misalignment between algorithmic classifications and expert judgments. To
bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework that integrates Semantic
Privileged Information (SPI) derived from large language models (LLMs) to align
recognition outcomes with human-interpretable reasoning. First, we introduce
DriBehavGPT, an interactive LLM-based module that generates natural-language
descriptions of driving behaviors. These descriptions are then encoded into
machine learning-compatible representations via text embedding and
dimensionality reduction. Finally, we incorporate them as privileged
information into Support Vector Machine Plus (SVM+) for training, enabling the
model to approximate human-like interpretation patterns. Experiments across
diverse real-world driving scenarios demonstrate that our SPI-enhanced
framework outperforms conventional methods, achieving F1-score improvements of
7.6% (car-following) and 7.9% (lane-changing). Importantly, SPI is exclusively
used during training, while inference relies solely on sensor data, ensuring
computational efficiency without sacrificing performance. These results
highlight the pivotal role of semantic behavioral representations in improving
recognition accuracy while advancing interpretable, human-centric driving
systems.

outline a forward-looking research agenda encompassing physics-aware data
models, adaptive storage-retrieval co-optimization, and standardized
benchmarking, to guide future research toward principled data management
solutions for EAI. Our survey is based on a comprehensive review of more than

Abstract: As robots get more integrated into human environments, fostering
trustworthiness in embodied robotic agents becomes paramount for an effective
and safe human-robot interaction (HRI). To achieve that, HRI applications must
promote human trust that aligns with robot skills and avoid misplaced trust or
overtrust, which can pose safety risks and ethical concerns. To achieve that,
HRI applications must promote human trust that aligns with robot skills and
avoid misplaced trust or overtrust, which can pose safety risks and ethical
concerns. In this position paper, we outline an interaction-based framework for
building trust through mutual understanding between humans and robots. We
emphasize two main pillars: human awareness and transparency, referring to the
robot ability to interpret human actions accurately and to clearly communicate
its intentions and goals, respectively. By integrating these two pillars,
robots can behave in a manner that aligns with human expectations and needs
while providing their human partners with both comprehension and control over
their actions. We also introduce four components that we think are important
for bridging the gap between a human-perceived sense of trust and a robot true
capabilities.

Conclusion: 以指向为中心的表示结合RFT训练范式，为弥合机器人感知-行动差距提供了一条有效且可泛化的途径。

Abstract: Generalization in embodied AI is hindered by the "seeing-to-doing gap," which
stems from data scarcity and embodiment heterogeneity. To address this, we
pioneer "pointing" as a unified, embodiment-agnostic intermediate
representation, defining four core embodied pointing abilities that bridge
high-level vision-language comprehension with low-level action primitives. We
introduce Embodied-R1, a 3B Vision-Language Model (VLM) specifically designed
for embodied reasoning and pointing. We use a wide range of embodied and
general visual reasoning datasets as sources to construct a large-scale
dataset, Embodied-Points-200K, which supports key embodied pointing
capabilities. We then train Embodied-R1 using a two-stage Reinforced
Fine-tuning (RFT) curriculum with a specialized multi-task reward design.
Embodied-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 embodied spatial and
pointing benchmarks. Critically, it demonstrates robust zero-shot
generalization by achieving a 56.2% success rate in the SIMPLEREnv and 87.5%
across 8 real-world XArm tasks without any task-specific fine-tuning,
representing a 62% improvement over strong baselines. Furthermore, the model
exhibits high robustness against diverse visual disturbances. Our work shows
that a pointing-centric representation, combined with an RFT training paradigm,
offers an effective and generalizable pathway to closing the perception-action
gap in robotics.

Conclusion: GEM系统证明了仅用少量演示就能实现动态物体操作的强泛化能力，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Realizing generalizable dynamic object manipulation is important for
enhancing manufacturing efficiency, as it eliminates specialized engineering
for various scenarios. To this end, imitation learning emerges as a promising
paradigm, leveraging expert demonstrations to teach a policy manipulation
skills. Although the generalization of an imitation learning policy can be
improved by increasing demonstrations, demonstration collection is
labor-intensive. To address this problem, this paper investigates whether
strong generalization in dynamic object manipulation is achievable with only a
few demonstrations. Specifically, we develop an entropy-based theoretical
framework to quantify the optimization of imitation learning. Based on this
framework, we propose a system named Generalizable Entropy-based Manipulation
(GEM). Extensive experiments in simulated and real tasks demonstrate that GEM
can generalize across diverse environment backgrounds, robot embodiments,
motion dynamics, and object geometries. Notably, GEM has been deployed in a
real canteen for tableware collection. Without any in-scene demonstration, it
achieves a success rate of over 97% across more than 10,000 operations.

Motivation: 研究小组形式的公平分配问题，特别是在婚姻咨询、团队资源分配等实际场景中，小组（如夫妻、团队）作为一个整体接收资源，但组内个体对资源有不同偏好，需要确保组间和组内的公平性。

Method: 采用算法设计和理论分析的方法，针对不同小组规模（特别是两人小组）设计分配算法，证明EF1和PROPk等公平性质的存在性和可计算性，并分析算法的计算复杂性和附加性质（如帕累托最优性）。

Result: 对于两个小组，EF1分配总是存在且可多项式时间找到；对于三个及以上小组，EF1分配可能不存在。对于规模不超过k的小组，PROPk分配总是存在且可高效计算，算法还能保证分数帕累托最优性和按agent顺序的PROP1、PROP2等性质。在某些特殊情况下，对任意数量的小组存在PROP1分配。

Conclusion: 小组公平分配问题中，EF1对于两个小组总是可行但三个以上可能不可行；PROPk对于有限规模小组总是可行且可高效计算，同时还能保证额外的优化性质，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: We study the fair allocation of indivisible goods across groups of agents,
where each agent fully enjoys all goods allocated to their group. We focus on
groups of two (couples) and other groups of small size. For two couples, an EF1
allocation -- one in which all agents find their group's bundle no worse than
the other group's, up to one good -- always exists and can be found
efficiently. For three or more couples, EF1 allocations need not exist.
  Turning to proportionality, we show that, whenever groups have size at most
$k$, a PROP$k$ allocation exists and can be found efficiently. In fact, our
algorithm additionally guarantees (fractional) Pareto optimality, and PROP1 to
the first agent in each group, PROP2 to the second, etc., for an arbitrary
agent ordering. In special cases, we show that there are PROP1 allocations for
any number of couples.

Result: 自适应策略能帮助用户防止观点漂移，当用户优先考虑观点保持时，自适应策略的期望效用优于固定策略

Conclusion: 用户层面的策略可以挑战推荐系统引起的偏见，自适应内容消费选择是有效的对抗手段

Abstract: Recommendation systems are used in a range of platforms to maximize user
engagement through personalization and the promotion of popular content. It has
been found that such recommendations may shape users' opinions over time. In
this paper, we ask whether reactive users, who are cognizant of the influence
of the content they consume, can prevent such changes by adaptively adjusting
their content consumption choices. To this end, we study users' opinion
dynamics under two types of stochastic policies: a passive policy where the
probability of clicking on recommended content is fixed and a reactive policy
where clicking probability adaptively decreases following large opinion drifts.
We analytically derive the expected opinion and user utility under these
policies. We show that the adaptive policy can help users prevent opinion
drifts and that when a user prioritizes opinion preservation, the expected
utility of the adaptive policy outperforms the fixed policy. We validate our
theoretical findings through numerical simulations. These findings help better
understand how user-level strategies can challenge the biases induced by
recommendation systems.

Motivation: 研究多维空间投票模型中候选人的战略定位问题，为竞选策略提供可实现的算法工具，理清多维空间选举的算法格局

Method: 使用几何方法分析ℓ_p-范数距离下的空间投票模型，开发超平面枚举算法(O(n^{d+1}))和径向扫描算法(O(n log n))，并扩展到位置评分规则如k-approval和Borda

Result: 证明对抗单个对手时计算最优位置是NP难的，但在常数维度下问题可解；提出了精确算法和首个多候选人情况的近似保证

Conclusion: 该研究为多维空间选举提供了实用的算法工具，阐明了问题的计算复杂性，几何方法可无缝扩展到多种投票规则

Abstract: We study strategic candidate positioning in multidimensional spatial-voting
elections. Voters and candidates are represented as points in $\mathbb{R}^d$,
and each voter supports the candidate that is closest under a distance induced
by an $\ell_p$-norm. We prove that computing an optimal location for a new
candidate is NP-hard already against a single opponent, whereas for a constant
number of issues the problem is tractable: an $O(n^{d+1})$
hyperplane-enumeration algorithm and an $O(n \log n)$ radial-sweep routine for
$d=2$ solve the task exactly. We further derive the first approximation
guarantees for the general multi-candidate case and show how our geometric
approach extends seamlessly to positional-scoring rules such as $k$-approval
and Borda. These results clarify the algorithmic landscape of multidimensional
spatial elections and provide practically implementable tools for campaign
strategy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加权投票游戏广泛应用于现实决策场景建模，如议会立法或公司投票。虽然通过添加玩家来控制游戏的研究已有成果，但通过删除玩家来控制玩家权力的计算复杂度问题仍未解决

Method: 研究加权投票游戏中通过删除玩家来改变或维持特定玩家权力的控制问题，使用概率Penrose-Banzhaf指数作为权力衡量标准，进行复杂度分析

Result: 发现当使用概率Penrose-Banzhaf指数时，这些控制问题对NP^PP类是完全的，显著改进了之前已知的较小复杂度类下界

Conclusion: 研究结果为实际应用中抵御SAT求解技术提供了保护，证明了通过删除玩家控制加权投票游戏的计算复杂度很高

Abstract: Weighted voting games are a popular class of coalitional games that are
widely used to model real-life situations of decision-making. They can be
applied, for instance, to analyze legislative processes in parliaments or
voting in corporate structures. Various ways of tampering with these games have
been studied, among them merging or splitting players, fiddling with the quota,
and controlling weighted voting games by adding or deleting players. While the
complexity of control by adding players to such games so as to change or
maintain a given player's power has been recently settled, the complexity of
control by deleting players from such games (with the same goals) remained
open. We show that when the players' power is measured by the probabilistic
Penrose-Banzhaf index, some of these problems are complete for NP^PP -- the
class of problems solvable by NP machines equipped with a PP ("probabilistic
polynomial time") oracle. Our results optimally improve the currently known
lower bounds of hardness for much smaller complexity classes, thus providing
protection against SAT-solving techniques in practical applications.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个针对可复制资源协作学习场景的公平分配机制，通过平衡互惠公理确保参与者之间的相互公平性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统合作博弈论（如Shapley值）假设资源不可复制，但数据和模型可以无限复制，需要新的公平性概念来处理协作学习中的互惠利益不平衡问题

Method: 提出新的公平公理和机制设计，特别是平衡互惠公理，确保每对参与者从对方参与中获得同等收益

Result: 开发了一个满足相互公平性属性的机制，并提供了数学证明

Conclusion: 该机制为可复制资源环境下的协作学习系统提供了公平奖励分配的理论基础，解决了传统方法无法处理的战略利用和不公平分配问题

Abstract: The latest developments in AI focus on agentic systems where artificial and
human agents cooperate to realize global goals. An example is collaborative
learning, which aims to train a global model based on data from individual
agents. A major challenge in designing such systems is to guarantee safety and
alignment with human values, particularly a fair distribution of rewards upon
achieving the global goal. Cooperative game theory offers useful abstractions
of cooperating agents via value functions, which assign value to each
coalition, and via reward functions. With these, the idea of fair allocation
can be formalized by specifying fairness axioms and designing concrete
mechanisms. Classical cooperative game theory, exemplified by the Shapley
value, does not fully capture scenarios like collaborative learning, as it
assumes nonreplicable resources, whereas data and models can be replicated.
Infinite replicability requires a generalized notion of fairness, formalized
through new axioms and mechanisms. These must address imbalances in reciprocal
benefits among participants, which can lead to strategic exploitation and
unfair allocations. The main contribution of this paper is a mechanism and a
proof that it fulfills the property of mutual fairness, formalized by the
Balanced Reciprocity Axiom. It ensures that, for every pair of players, each
benefits equally from the participation of the other.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 研究发现，在小提琴音乐转录任务中，从头训练的模型表现与基于钢琴预训练模型微调的模型相当甚至更好，表明小提琴AMT可以不依赖钢琴预训练表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小提琴自动音乐转录(AMT)由于标注数据有限而研究不足，需要探索是否必须依赖钢琴预训练模型，还是可以通过中等规模的小提琴数据集从头训练获得良好性能。

Method: 采用未经修改的钢琴转录架构，在包含约30小时对齐小提琴录音的MOSA数据集上从头训练模型，并在URMP和Bach10数据集上进行评估。

Result: 实验结果显示，从头训练的模型在性能上与微调模型相当甚至更优，表明不需要依赖预训练的钢琴表示。

Conclusion: 强大小提琴AMT可以不依赖钢琴预训练表示，这强调了乐器特定数据收集和增强策略的重要性。

Abstract: Automatic music transcription (AMT) has achieved remarkable progress for
instruments such as the piano, largely due to the availability of large-scale,
high-quality datasets. In contrast, violin AMT remains underexplored due to
limited annotated data. A common approach is to fine-tune pretrained models for
other downstream tasks, but the effectiveness of such transfer remains unclear
in the presence of timbral and articulatory differences. In this work, we
investigate whether training from scratch on a medium-scale violin dataset can
match the performance of fine-tuned piano-pretrained models. We adopt a piano
transcription architecture without modification and train it on the MOSA
dataset, which contains about 30 hours of aligned violin recordings. Our
experiments on URMP and Bach10 show that models trained from scratch achieved
competitive or even superior performance compared to fine-tuned counterparts.
These findings suggest that strong violin AMT is possible without relying on
pretrained piano representations, highlighting the importance of
instrument-specific data collection and augmentation strategies.

Motivation: 现有的Mamba模型如SEMamba仅限于单说话人场景，在鸡尾酒会等多说话人复杂环境中表现不佳，需要视觉信息来辅助音频处理。

Method: 提出AVSEMamba模型，将全脸视觉线索与基于Mamba的时间骨干网络相结合，利用时空视觉信息来更准确地提取目标语音。

Result: 在AVSEC-4挑战赛开发和盲测集上，AVSEMamba在语音可懂度(STOI)、感知质量(PESQ)和非侵入式质量(UTMOS)方面均优于其他单声道基线方法，并获得单声道排行榜第一名。

Conclusion: 音频-视觉融合方法能够显著提升Mamba模型在复杂多说话人环境中的语音增强性能，视觉信息的引入是解决鸡尾酒会问题的有效途径。

Abstract: Recent Mamba-based models have shown promise in speech enhancement by
efficiently modeling long-range temporal dependencies. However, models like
Speech Enhancement Mamba (SEMamba) remain limited to single-speaker scenarios
and struggle in complex multi-speaker environments such as the cocktail party
problem. To overcome this, we introduce AVSEMamba, an audio-visual speech
enhancement model that integrates full-face visual cues with a Mamba-based
temporal backbone. By leveraging spatiotemporal visual information, AVSEMamba
enables more accurate extraction of target speech in challenging conditions.
Evaluated on the AVSEC-4 Challenge development and blind test sets, AVSEMamba
outperforms other monaural baselines in speech intelligibility (STOI),
perceptual quality (PESQ), and non-intrusive quality (UTMOS), and achieves
\textbf{1st place} on the monaural leaderboard.

TL;DR: DegDiT是一个基于动态事件图引导的扩散变压器框架，用于开放词汇的文本到音频生成控制，通过结构化图表示和共识偏好优化实现精确的时序控制和高质量音频生成


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到音频生成方法在准确时序定位、开放词汇扩展性和实际效率之间存在固有权衡，需要解决这些挑战以实现更精确的音频内容控制

Method: 提出DegDiT框架：1)将事件编码为结构化动态图（语义特征、时序属性、事件间连接）；2)使用图变压器生成上下文事件嵌入；3)引入质量平衡数据选择流程；4)提出共识偏好优化方法

Result: 在AudioCondition、DESED和AudioTime数据集上的广泛实验表明，DegDiT在各种客观和主观评估指标上均达到最先进性能

Conclusion: DegDiT通过动态事件图引导和共识优化机制，成功解决了可控文本到音频生成中的时序精度、词汇扩展性和效率问题，为精确音频控制提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Controllable text-to-audio generation aims to synthesize audio from textual
descriptions while satisfying user-specified constraints, including event
types, temporal sequences, and onset and offset timestamps. This enables
precise control over both the content and temporal structure of the generated
audio. Despite recent progress, existing methods still face inherent trade-offs
among accurate temporal localization, open-vocabulary scalability, and
practical efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose DegDiT, a novel
dynamic event graph-guided diffusion transformer framework for open-vocabulary
controllable audio generation. DegDiT encodes the events in the description as
structured dynamic graphs. The nodes in each graph are designed to represent
three aspects: semantic features, temporal attributes, and inter-event
connections. A graph transformer is employed to integrate these nodes and
produce contextualized event embeddings that serve as guidance for the
diffusion model. To ensure high-quality and diverse training data, we introduce
a quality-balanced data selection pipeline that combines hierarchical event
annotation with multi-criteria quality scoring, resulting in a curated dataset
with semantic diversity. Furthermore, we present consensus preference
optimization, facilitating audio generation through consensus among multiple
reward signals. Extensive experiments on AudioCondition, DESED, and AudioTime
datasets demonstrate that DegDiT achieves state-of-the-art performances across
a variety of objective and subjective evaluation metrics.

Motivation: 评估讲者去识别技术的实际效果，量化残余身份泄漏，揭示当前技术在保护讲者隐私方面的不足之处。

Method: 引入了一个综合性评测标准，使用三种互补的错误率指标：相等错误率(EER)、积累匹配特征命中率(CMC)、以及通过典型相关分析和Procrustes分析测量的嵌入空间相似性。

Result: 所有状态最佳的讲者去识别系统都存在身份信息泄漏。评测中性能最高的系统仅略强于随机猜测，而性能最低的系统在CMC前50名合考者中达到45%的命中率。

Conclusion: 当前讲者去识别技术存在持续的隐私风险，需要更有效的方案来真正保护讲者身份信息，避免泄漏。

Abstract: Speaker de-identification aims to conceal a speaker's identity while
preserving intelligibility of the underlying speech. We introduce a benchmark
that quantifies residual identity leakage with three complementary error rates:
equal error rate, cumulative match characteristic hit rate, and embedding-space
similarity measured via canonical correlation analysis and Procrustes analysis.
Evaluation results reveal that all state-of-the-art speaker de-identification
systems leak identity information. The highest performing system in our
evaluation performs only slightly better than random guessing, while the lowest
performing system achieves a 45% hit rate within the top 50 candidates based on
CMC. These findings highlight persistent privacy risks in current speaker
de-identification technologies.

Method: 采用两阶段随机规划方法，建模VSG控制的GFMI作为黑启动资源，使用三个瞬态指标作为频率动态约束，结合智能开关实现位置无关的同步，处理季节相关运行条件和不可预测的输电网停电持续时间等不确定性。

Conclusion: 所提出的SDMG-BS框架能够实现风险规避和自适应恢复，确保黑启动过程中的频率稳定性，为分布式能源系统的黑启动提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Extended outages in distributed systems (DSs) dominated by distributed energy
resources (DERs) require innovative strategies to efficiently and securely
deploy black start (BS) resources. To address the need, this paper proposes a
two-stage stochastic resource allocation method within synchronizing dynamic
microgrids (MGs) for black start (SDMG-BS), enabling risk-averse and adaptive
restoration across various scenarios while ensuring frequency security. Virtual
synchronous generator (VSG)-controlled grid-forming inverters (GFMIs) equipped
with primary frequency governors (PFGs) are modeled as BS resources. Their
frequency response is characterized by three transient indices, which are
deployed as frequency dynamic constraints on load pick-up events to ensure
frequency stability during the BS process. SDMG-BS framework facilitates
location-independent synchronization among restored MGs and with the
transmission grid (TG) with the help of smart switches (SSWs). The model
incorporates scenario-based stochastic programming to address multi-source
uncertainties, including season-dependent operational conditions and
unpredictable TG outage durations, ensuring a resilient allocation plan. The
proposed approach is validated on a modified IEEE 123-node feeder with three
study cases designed across sixteen uncertainty scenarios.

Abstract: With rising demands for efficient disease and salinity management in
agriculture, early detection of plant stressors is crucial, particularly for
high-value crops like avocados. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation
of low-cost sensors deployed in the field for early stress and disease
detection in avocado plants. Our monitoring system was deployed across 72
plants divided into four treatment categories within a greenhouse environment,
with data collected over six months. While leaf temperature and conductivity
measurements, widely used metrics for controlled settings, were found
unreliable in field conditions due to environmental interference and
positioning challenges, leaf spectral measurements produced statistically
significant results when combined with our machine learning approach. For soil
data analysis, we developed a two-level hierarchical classifier that leverages
domain knowledge about treatment characteristics, achieving 75-86\% accuracy
across different avocado genotypes and outperforming conventional machine
learning approaches by over 20\%. In addition, performance evaluation on an
embedded edge device demonstrated the viability of our approach for
resource-constrained environments, with reasonable computational efficiency
while maintaining high classification accuracy. Our work bridges the gap
between theoretical potential and practical application of low-cost sensors in
agriculture and offers insights for developing affordable, scalable monitoring
systems.

Conclusion: PredSLS框架实现了控制器与底层通信拓扑的协同设计，为大规模网络化系统的分布式控制提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Distributed control of large-scale systems is challenging due to the need for
scalable and localized communication and computation. In this work, we
introduce a Predictive System-Level Synthesis PredSLS framework that designs
controllers by jointly integrating communication constraints and local
disturbance predictions into an affine feedback structure. Rather than focusing
on the worst-case uncertainty, PredSLS leverages both current state feedback
and future system disturbance predictions to achieve distributed control of
networked systems. In particular, PredSLS enables a unified system synthesis of
the optimal $\kappa$-localized controller, therefore outperforms approaches
with post hoc communication truncation, as was commonly seen in the literature.
The PredSLS framework can be naturally decomposed into spatial and temporal
components for efficient and parallelizable computation across the network,
yielding a regret upper bound that explicitly depends on the prediction error
and communication range. Our regret analysis not only reveals a non-monotonic
trade-off between control performance and communication range when prediction
errors are present, but also guides the identification of an optimal size for
local communication neighborhoods, thereby enabling the co-design of controller
and its underlying communication topology.

Motivation: 解决高阶多输入多输出多项式非线性系统的模型降阶问题，传统线性方法难以直接应用，需要发展适用于非线性系统的矩匹配理论。

Method: 采用幂级数分解技术，将描述中心流形的非线性偏微分方程分解为一系列递归定义的Sylvester方程求解，实现解析化模型降阶。

Conclusion: 该方法为非线性矩匹配问题提供了新见解，实现了类似线性情况的解析化非线性模型降阶，扩展了矩匹配理论在非线性系统中的应用。

Abstract: The model reduction problem for high-order multi-input, multi-output (MIMO)
polynomial nonlinear systems based on moment matching is addressed. The
technique of power-series decomposition is exploited: this decomposes the
solution of the nonlinear PDE characterizing the center manifold into the
solutions of a series of recursively defined Sylvester equations. This approach
allows yielding nonlinear reduced-order models in very much the same way as in
the linear case (e.g. analytically). Algorithms are proposed for obtaining the
order and the parameters of the reduced-order models with precision of degree
$\kappa$. The approach also provides new insights into the nonlinear moment
matching problem: first, a lower bound for the order of the reduced-order model
is obtained, which, in the MIMO case, can be strictly less than the number of
matched moments; second, it is revealed that the lower bound is affected by the
ratio of the number of the input and output channels; third, it is shown that
under mild conditions, a nonlinear reduced-order model can always be
constructed with either a linear state equation or a linear output equation.

Abstract: Optimal sensor placement is essential for state estimation and effective
network monitoring. As known in the literature, this problem becomes
particularly challenging in large-scale undirected or bidirected cyclic
networks with parametric uncertainties, such as water distribution networks
(WDNs), where pipe resistance and demand patterns are often unknown. Motivated
by the challenges of cycles, parametric uncertainties, and scalability, this
paper proposes a sensor placement algorithm that guarantees structural
observability for cyclic and acyclic networks with parametric uncertainties. By
leveraging a graph-based strategy, the proposed method efficiently addresses
the computational complexities of large-scale networks. To demonstrate the
algorithm's effectiveness, we apply it to several EPANET benchmark WDNs. Most
notably, the developed algorithm solves the sensor placement problem with
guaranteed structured observability for the L-town WDN with 1694 nodes and 124
cycles in under 0.1 seconds.

Abstract: Many safety-critical real-world problems, such as autonomous driving and
collaborative robots, are of a distributed multi-agent nature. To optimize the
performance of these systems while ensuring safety, we can cast them as
distributed optimization problems, where each agent aims to optimize their
parameters to maximize a coupled reward function subject to coupled
constraints. Prior work either studies a centralized setting, does not consider
safety, or struggles with sample efficiency. Since we require sample efficiency
and work with unknown and nonconvex rewards and constraints, we solve this
optimization problem using safe Bayesian optimization with Gaussian process
regression. Moreover, we consider nearest-neighbor communication between the
agents. To capture the behavior of non-neighboring agents, we reformulate the
static global optimization problem as a time-varying local optimization problem
for each agent, essentially introducing time as a latent variable. To this end,
we propose a custom spatio-temporal kernel to integrate prior knowledge. We
show the successful deployment of our algorithm in simulations.

Abstract: With the increased penetration of renewable energy and reduced proportion of
synchronous generators, the low-inertia characteristics of todays power system
become prominent, and the transient stability issue of grid following converter
(GFLC) under low inertia system (LIS) condition becomes critical. There are two
prominent problems in the transient stability analysis of GFLC-LIS. The angular
dynamic of LIS increases the complexity of transient stability analysis, and
the nonlinear, possibly negative damping of GFLC makes it difficult to
guarantee the conservative of the traditional methods. These problems make the
traditional methods inapplicable. In this paper, the transient stability
analysis of GFLC LIS is investigated to provide an accurate estimation of the
attraction boundary and critical clearance time (CCT). Firstly, a dynamic model
of GFLC-LIS is constructed, considering the phase-locked loop (PLL)-based GFLC
dynamics and swing equation-based LIS dynamics. The frequency mutation of PLL
at fault occurrence and clearing time is also considered. Secondly, a Zubov
based transient stability analysis method is proposed, which can construct the
energy function in a way that is different from the traditional conservation of
energy perspective and can address the negative damping issue. Moreover, the
accuracy of the CCT estimation is analyzed, and the influences of LIS
parameters on transient stability are illustrated. Finally, simulation
experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method

Abstract: This paper uses multi-object tracking methods known from the radar tracking
community to address the problem of pedestrian tracking using 2D bounding box
detections. The standard point-object (SPO) model is adopted, and the posterior
density is computed using the Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM) filter.
The selection of the model parameters rooted in continuous time is discussed,
including the birth and survival probabilities. Some parameters are selected
from the first principles, while others are identified from the data, which is,
in this case, the publicly available MOT-17 dataset. Although the resulting
PMBM algorithm yields promising results, a mismatch between the SPO model and
the data is revealed. The model-based approach assumes that modifying the
problematic components causing the SPO model-data mismatch will lead to better
model-based algorithms in future developments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MPC虽然是非线性多输入多输出系统控制的强大技术，但在工业车辆集成中面临高计算需求和实现复杂性的挑战，需要开发更易用且高效的工具。

Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a powerful technique to control nonlinear,
multi-input multi-output systems subject to input and state constraints. It is
now a standard tool for trajectory tracking control of automated vehicles. As
such it has been used in many research and development projects. However, MPC
faces several challenges to be integrated into industrial production vehicles.
The most important ones are its high computational demands and the complexity
of implementation. The software packages AutoMPC aims to address both of these
challenges. It builds on a robustified version of an active set algorithm for
Nonlinear MPC. The algorithm is embedded into a framework for vehicle
trajectory tracking, which makes it easy to used, yet highly customizable.
Automatic code generation transforms the selections into a standalone,
computationally efficient C-code file with static memory allocation. As such it
can be readily deployed on a wide range of embedded platforms, e.g., based on
Matlab/Simulink or Robot Operating System (ROS). Compared to a previous version
of the code, the vehicle model and the numerical integration method can be
manually specified, besides basic algorithm parameters. All of this information
and all specifications are directly baked into the generated C-code. The
algorithm is suitable driving scenarios at low or high speeds, even drifting,
and supports direction changes. Multiple simulation scenarios show the
versatility and effectiveness of the AutoMPC code, with the guarantee of a
feasible solution, a high degree of robustness, and computational efficiency.

Abstract: This paper addresses the prescribed performance control (PPC) challenge for
high-order nonlinear systems affected by mismatched disturbances. The research
aims to prevent singularity issues arising from error boundary violations
during abrupt changes in reference trajectories. We introduce a novel
transformation function with infinite-order differentiability at connection
points, advancing beyond mere continuous differentiability. Utilizing this
transformation function, we develop a comprehensive transformation strategy
that ensures: (1) errors remain within prescribed boundaries when reference
trajectories are smooth, and (2) errors return to prescribed boundaries within
a specified timeframe following abrupt changes in reference trajectories.
Additionally, the complexity explosion issue inherent in backstepping design is
effectively resolved. Simulation results corroborate the validity of the
proposed theoretical advancements.

Abstract: The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) presents sustainability
challenges such as increased maintenance requirements and overall higher energy
consumption. This motivates self-sustainable IoT ecosystems based on Energy
Harvesting (EH). This paper treats IoT deployments in which IoT devices (IoTDs)
rely solely on EH to sense and transmit information about events/alarms to a
base station (BS). The objective is to effectively manage the duty cycling of
the IoTDs to prolong battery life and maximize the relevant data sent to the
BS. The BS can also wake up specific IoTDs if extra information about an event
is needed upon initial detection. We propose a K-nearest neighbors (KNN)-based
duty cycling management to optimize energy efficiency and detection accuracy by
considering spatial correlations among IoTDs' activity and their EH process. We
evaluate machine learning approaches, including reinforcement learning (RL) and
decision transformers (DT), to maximize information captured from events while
managing energy consumption. Significant improvements over the state-ofthe-art
approaches are obtained in terms of energy saving by all three proposals, KNN,
RL, and DT. Moreover, the RL-based solution approaches the performance of a
genie-aided benchmark as the number of IoTDs increases.

Conclusion: LLMind 2.0通过自然语言作为统一通信媒介，成功克服了设备异构性障碍，实现了不同制造商设备间的无缝协作。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have sparked interest in
their application to IoT and automation systems, particularly for facilitating
device management through natural language instructions. However, existing
centralized approaches face significant scalability challenges when managing
and coordinating the collaboration between IoT devices of diverse capabilities
in large-scale heterogeneous IoT systems. This paper introduces LLMind 2.0, a
distributed IoT automation framework that addresses the scalability challenges
through lightweight LLM-empowered device agents via natural language-based
machine-to-machine (M2M) communication. Unlike previous LLM-controlled
automation systems that rely on a centralized coordinator to generate
device-specific code to be executed on individual devices, LLMind 2.0
distributes intelligence across individual devices through lightweight LLMs
embedded in IoT devices. The central coordinator translates human instructions
into simple subtasks described in natural human language, which are then
processed by device-specific agents to generate device-specific code locally at
the associated devices. This approach transcends device heterogeneity barriers
by using natural language as a unified communication medium, enabling seamless
collaboration between devices from different manufacturers. The system
incorporates several key innovations: a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
mechanism for accurate subtask-to-API mapping, fine-tuned lightweight LLMs for
reliable code generation, and a finite state machine-based task execution
framework. Experimental validation in multi-robot warehouse scenarios and
real-world WiFi network deployments demonstrates significant improvements in
scalability, reliability, and privacy protection compared to the centralized
approach.
