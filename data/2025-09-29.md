Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种模型无关的框架，使用直接偏好优化(DPO)来增强放射学报告生成(RRG)的准确性，通过随机对比采样构建训练对，无需奖励模型或人工偏好标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有放射学报告生成方法在真实临床环境中的质量仍不足，而大型视觉语言模型在通用领域通过采用LLM训练策略取得了显著进展。

Method: 使用直接偏好优化(DPO)框架，通过随机对比采样构建训练对，无需额外训练数据或人工标注。

Result: 在三个最先进模型上补充使用随机DPO后，临床性能指标提升高达5%。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效提升放射学报告生成的准确性，且具有模型无关性，无需额外数据或人工标注。

Abstract: Radiography Report Generation (RRG) has gained significant attention in
medical image analysis as a promising tool for alleviating the growing workload
of radiologists. However, despite numerous advancements, existing methods have
yet to achieve the quality required for deployment in real-world clinical
settings. Meanwhile, large Visual Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable progress in the general domain by adopting training strategies
originally designed for Large Language Models (LLMs), such as alignment
techniques. In this paper, we introduce a model-agnostic framework to enhance
RRG accuracy using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our approach leverages
random contrastive sampling to construct training pairs, eliminating the need
for reward models or human preference annotations. Experiments on supplementing
three state-of-the-art models with our Random DPO show that our method improves
clinical performance metrics by up to 5%, without requiring any additional
training data.

### [2] [Improving Autism Detection with Multimodal Behavioral Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21352)
*William Saakyan,Matthias Norden,Lola Eversmann,Simon Kirsch,Muyu Lin,Simon Guendelman,Isabel Dziobek,Hanna Drimalla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于多模态行为分析的自闭症谱系障碍(ASC)计算机辅助诊断方法，通过分析面部表情、声音韵律、头部运动、心率变异性和凝视行为，在168名ASC参与者和157名非自闭症参与者的标准化视频数据集上实现了74%的分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自闭症计算机辅助诊断方法存在凝视特征性能差和缺乏现实世界泛化能力的问题，需要开发更有效的多模态分析方法来支持自闭症评估。

Method: 使用标准化视频数据集进行多模态分析，包括面部表情、声音韵律、头部运动、心率变异性和凝视行为。针对凝视模型局限性，引入了量化眼球凝视角度变异性的新型统计描述符，并采用后期融合方法整合多模态特征。

Result: 新型凝视描述符将基于凝视的分类准确率从64%提升到69%，多模态融合后整体分类准确率达到74%，与临床研究中关于ASC凝视回避的发现一致。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明基于视频的多模态行为分析具有开发可扩展自闭症筛查工具的潜力，能够有效支持自闭症评估过程。

Abstract: Due to the complex and resource-intensive nature of diagnosing Autism
Spectrum Condition (ASC), several computer-aided diagnostic support methods
have been proposed to detect autism by analyzing behavioral cues in patient
video data. While these models show promising results on some datasets, they
struggle with poor gaze feature performance and lack of real-world
generalizability. To tackle these challenges, we analyze a standardized video
dataset comprising 168 participants with ASC (46% female) and 157 non-autistic
participants (46% female), making it, to our knowledge, the largest and most
balanced dataset available. We conduct a multimodal analysis of facial
expressions, voice prosody, head motion, heart rate variability (HRV), and gaze
behavior. To address the limitations of prior gaze models, we introduce novel
statistical descriptors that quantify variability in eye gaze angles, improving
gaze-based classification accuracy from 64% to 69% and aligning computational
findings with clinical research on gaze aversion in ASC. Using late fusion, we
achieve a classification accuracy of 74%, demonstrating the effectiveness of
integrating behavioral markers across multiple modalities. Our findings
highlight the potential for scalable, video-based screening tools to support
autism assessment.

### [3] [KV-Efficient VLA: A Method of Speed up Vision Language Model with RNN-Gated Chunked KV Cache](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21354)
*Wanshun Xu,Long Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KV-Efficient VLA是一个模型无关的内存压缩框架，通过轻量级训练友好机制选择性保留高效用上下文，解决VLA模型在长时推理中的注意力二次成本和KV内存无限增长问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA模型在统一机器人感知和控制方面具有潜力，但其可扩展性受到注意力二次成本和长时推理中KV内存无限增长的约束。现有方法通过扩展骨干架构改善泛化能力，但忽视了实时部署关键推理效率问题。

Method: 将KV缓存划分为固定大小的块，使用循环门控模块根据学习的效用分数总结和过滤历史上下文，保留近期细粒度细节同时积极修剪陈旧低相关内存，同时保持因果性。

Result: 理论上可获得1.21倍推理加速和36% KV内存减少，对任务成功率影响最小。方法可无缝集成到现有自回归和混合VLA堆栈中，无需修改训练流程或下游控制逻辑。

Conclusion: KV-Efficient VLA框架有效解决了VLA模型在长时推理中的内存和效率瓶颈，为实时部署提供了可扩展的推理解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models promise unified robotic perception and
control, yet their scalability is constrained by the quadratic cost of
attention and the unbounded growth of key-value (KV) memory during long-horizon
inference. While recent methods improve generalization through scaling backbone
architectures, they often neglect the inference inefficiencies critical to
real-time deployment. In this work, we present KV-Efficient VLA, a
model-agnostic memory compression framework that addresses these limitations by
introducing a lightweight, training-friendly mechanism to selectively retain
high-utility context. Our method partitions the KV cache into fixed size chunks
and employs a recurrent gating module to summarize and filter historical
context according to learned utility scores. This design preserves recent
fine-grained detail while aggressively pruning stale, low-relevance memory, all
while maintaining causality. Theoretically, KV-Efficient VLA yields up to 1.21x
inference speedup and 36% KV memory reduction, with minimal impact on task
success. Our method integrates seamlessly into existing autoregressive and
hybrid VLA stacks, enabling scalable inference without modifying training
pipelines or downstream control logic.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于短语定位的事实核查模型，用于检测自动生成的胸部X光报告中发现的错误及其位置，通过合成数据集和多标签跨模态对比回归网络实现高精度验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模视觉语言模型生成的放射学报告存在事实错误和幻觉问题，阻碍了其临床应用，需要开发能够检测报告中错误发现及其位置的方法。

Method: 通过扰动真实报告中的发现和位置创建合成数据集，训练多标签跨模态对比回归网络来验证发现的可信度和定位准确性。

Result: 在多个X光数据集上展示了方法在发现可信度预测和定位方面的鲁棒性，与基于真实情况的验证达到0.997的和谐相关系数。

Conclusion: 该方法在放射学工作流程的临床推理中具有实用性，能够有效检测最先进报告生成器产生的错误。

Abstract: With the emergence of large-scale vision language models (VLM), it is now
possible to produce realistic-looking radiology reports for chest X-ray images.
However, their clinical translation has been hampered by the factual errors and
hallucinations in the produced descriptions during inference. In this paper, we
present a novel phrase-grounded fact-checking model (FC model) that detects
errors in findings and their indicated locations in automatically generated
chest radiology reports.
  Specifically, we simulate the errors in reports through a large synthetic
dataset derived by perturbing findings and their locations in ground truth
reports to form real and fake findings-location pairs with images. A new
multi-label cross-modal contrastive regression network is then trained on this
dataset. We present results demonstrating the robustness of our method in terms
of accuracy of finding veracity prediction and localization on multiple X-ray
datasets. We also show its effectiveness for error detection in reports of SOTA
report generators on multiple datasets achieving a concordance correlation
coefficient of 0.997 with ground truth-based verification, thus pointing to its
utility during clinical inference in radiology workflows.

### [5] [MDF-MLLM: Deep Fusion Through Cross-Modal Feature Alignment for Contextually Aware Fundoscopic Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21358)
*Jason Jordan,Mohammadreza Akbari Lor,Peter Koulen,Mei-Ling Shyu,Shu-Ching Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MDF-MLLM多模态深度学习架构，通过融合视网膜图像的多尺度特征和全局文本上下文，显著提升视网膜疾病分类准确率，相比基线模型准确率从60%提升至94%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM模型难以捕捉视网膜疾病诊断所需的关键空间细节特征，如青光眼、糖尿病视网膜病变和视网膜色素变性等疾病的诊断。

Method: 集成U-Net编码器四层的跳跃特征到LLaMA 3.2 11B MLLM的交叉注意力块中，采用补丁投影、缩放交叉注意力和FiLM-based U-Net调制进行特征融合。

Result: 在1,305个图像-文本对数据集上，MDF-MLLM达到94%准确率，比基线模型提升56%，召回率和F1分数分别提升67%和35%。

Conclusion: MDF-MLLM为眼底图像分类提供了可泛化、可解释的模块化框架，在空间推理和分类方面表现优异，有望应用于临床决策支持系统。

Abstract: This study aimed to enhance disease classification accuracy from retinal
fundus images by integrating fine-grained image features and global textual
context using a novel multimodal deep learning architecture. Existing
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to capture low-level
spatial details critical for diagnosing retinal diseases such as glaucoma,
diabetic retinopathy, and retinitis pigmentosa. This model development and
validation study was conducted on 1,305 fundus image-text pairs compiled from
three public datasets (FIVES, HRF, and StoneRounds), covering acquired and
inherited retinal diseases, and evaluated using classification accuracy and
F1-score. The MDF-MLLM integrates skip features from four U-Net encoder layers
into cross-attention blocks within a LLaMA 3.2 11B MLLM. Vision features are
patch-wise projected and fused using scaled cross-attention and FiLM-based
U-Net modulation. Baseline MLLM achieved 60% accuracy on the dual-type disease
classification task. MDF-MLLM, with both U-Net and MLLM components fully
fine-tuned during training, achieved a significantly higher accuracy of 94%,
representing a 56% improvement. Recall and F1-scores improved by as much as 67%
and 35% over baseline, respectively. Ablation studies confirmed that the
multi-depth fusion approach contributed to substantial gains in spatial
reasoning and classification, particularly for inherited diseases with rich
clinical text. MDF-MLLM presents a generalizable, interpretable, and modular
framework for fundus image classification, outperforming traditional MLLM
baselines through multi-scale feature fusion. The architecture holds promise
for real-world deployment in clinical decision support systems. Future work
will explore synchronized training techniques, a larger pool of diseases for
more generalizability, and extending the model for segmentation tasks.

### [6] [Multimodal Prompt Decoupling Attack on the Safety Filters in Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21360)
*Xingkai Peng,Jun Jiang,Meng Tong,Shuai Li,Weiming Zhang,Nenghai Yu,Kejiang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出多模态提示解耦攻击(MPDA)，通过图像模态分离不安全提示的有害语义成分，绕过文本到图像模型的安全过滤器生成NSFW内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有越狱方法主要操纵文本提示，未能充分利用图像输入的漏洞，且文本方法难以绕过模型的安全过滤器。

Method: 使用大语言模型将不安全提示解耦为伪安全提示和有害提示，重写有害提示为自然对抗提示，通过视觉语言模型生成图像描述确保语义一致性。

Result: MPDA能够有效绕过T2I模型的安全过滤器，生成与原始不安全提示语义一致的NSFW图像。

Conclusion: 该方法揭示了多模态输入在模型安全中的潜在漏洞，为防御此类攻击提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have been widely applied in generating
high-fidelity images across various domains. However, these models may also be
abused to produce Not-Safe-for-Work (NSFW) content via jailbreak attacks.
Existing jailbreak methods primarily manipulate the textual prompt, leaving
potential vulnerabilities in image-based inputs largely unexplored. Moreover,
text-based methods face challenges in bypassing the model's safety filters. In
response to these limitations, we propose the Multimodal Prompt Decoupling
Attack (MPDA), which utilizes image modality to separate the harmful semantic
components of the original unsafe prompt. MPDA follows three core steps:
firstly, a large language model (LLM) decouples unsafe prompts into pseudo-safe
prompts and harmful prompts. The former are seemingly harmless sub-prompts that
can bypass filters, while the latter are sub-prompts with unsafe semantics that
trigger filters. Subsequently, the LLM rewrites the harmful prompts into
natural adversarial prompts to bypass safety filters, which guide the T2I model
to modify the base image into an NSFW output. Finally, to ensure semantic
consistency between the generated NSFW images and the original unsafe prompts,
the visual language model generates image captions, providing a new pathway to
guide the LLM in iterative rewriting and refining the generated content.

### [7] [A Mutual Learning Method for Salient Object Detection with intertwined Multi-Supervision--Revised](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21363)
*Runmin Wu,Mengyang Feng,Wenlong Guan,Dong Wang,Huchuan Lu,Errui Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种通过结合显著目标检测、前景轮廓检测和边缘检测任务的多任务学习方法，利用相互学习模块提升显著目标检测的完整性和边界精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前显著目标检测中由于物体内部复杂性和卷积池化操作导致的预测不完整和边界不准确问题。

Method: 使用显著目标检测、前景轮廓检测和边缘检测三个任务的相互监督，开发相互学习模块(MLM)作为核心构建块，通过多分支网络进行相互学习训练。

Result: 在七个挑战性数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在显著目标检测和边缘检测任务上都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过多任务相互学习和相互学习模块的协同作用，能够有效提升显著目标检测的完整性和边界精度，在多个数据集上取得state-of-the-art结果。

Abstract: Though deep learning techniques have made great progress in salient object
detection recently, the predicted saliency maps still suffer from incomplete
predictions due to the internal complexity of objects and inaccurate boundaries
caused by strides in convolution and pooling operations. To alleviate these
issues, we propose to train saliency detection networks by exploiting the
supervision from not only salient object detection, but also foreground contour
detection and edge detection. First, we leverage salient object detection and
foreground contour detection tasks in an intertwined manner to generate
saliency maps with uniform highlight. Second, the foreground contour and edge
detection tasks guide each other simultaneously, thereby leading to precise
foreground contour prediction and reducing the local noises for edge
prediction. In addition, we develop a novel mutual learning module (MLM) which
serves as the building block of our method. Each MLM consists of multiple
network branches trained in a mutual learning manner, which improves the
performance by a large margin. Extensive experiments on seven challenging
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method has delivered state-of-the-art
results in both salient object detection and edge detection.

### [8] [MAJORScore: A Novel Metric for Evaluating Multimodal Relevance via Joint Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21365)
*Zhicheng Du,Qingyang Shi,Jiasheng Lu,Yingshan Liang,Xinyu Zhang,Yiran Wang,Peiwu Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MAJORScore，一种用于评估多模态（≥3个模态）相关性的新指标，通过多模态联合表示实现公平的相关性评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标仅适用于两种模态的相关分析，限制了多模态相似性评估。需要一种能够处理三个及以上模态相关性的新指标。

Method: 利用多模态联合表示将多个模态整合到同一潜在空间，在统一尺度上准确表示不同模态，为公平相关性评分提供支持。

Result: 实验表明，MAJORScore在一致性模态上提升26.03%-64.29%，在不一致性模态上降低13.28%-20.54%，相比现有方法更可靠。

Conclusion: MAJORScore可作为大规模多模态数据集相似性评估和多模态模型性能评估的更可靠指标。

Abstract: The multimodal relevance metric is usually borrowed from the embedding
ability of pretrained contrastive learning models for bimodal data, which is
used to evaluate the correlation between cross-modal data (e.g., CLIP).
However, the commonly used evaluation metrics are only suitable for the
associated analysis between two modalities, which greatly limits the evaluation
of multimodal similarity. Herein, we propose MAJORScore, a brand-new evaluation
metric for the relevance of multiple modalities ($N$ modalities, $N\ge3$) via
multimodal joint representation for the first time. The ability of multimodal
joint representation to integrate multiple modalities into the same latent
space can accurately represent different modalities at one scale, providing
support for fair relevance scoring. Extensive experiments have shown that
MAJORScore increases by 26.03%-64.29% for consistent modality and decreases by
13.28%-20.54% for inconsistence compared to existing methods. MAJORScore serves
as a more reliable metric for evaluating similarity on large-scale multimodal
datasets and multimodal model performance evaluation.

*Sameer Prabhu,Amit Patwardhan,Ramin Karim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发基于AI的云平台，通过点云数据分析脚手架结构，自动检测结构修改，提高安全检查准确性和效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统脚手架安全检查依赖人工视觉检查，耗时且易出错，存在安全隐患，需要更准确高效的自动化检测方法

Method: 构建云基AI平台，处理脚手架点云数据，通过对比认证参考数据与最新点云数据来检测结构修改

Result: 提出的系统能够自动监测脚手架结构变化，减少人工检查时间和精力

Conclusion: AI和数字化技术能够显著提升脚手架安全检查的准确性和效率，改善施工现场安全

Abstract: In the construction industry, safety assessment is vital to ensure both the
reliability of assets and the safety of workers. Scaffolding, a key structural
support asset requires regular inspection to detect and identify alterations
from the design rules that may compromise the integrity and stability. At
present, inspections are primarily visual and are conducted by site manager or
accredited personnel to identify deviations. However, visual inspection is
time-intensive and can be susceptible to human errors, which can lead to unsafe
conditions. This paper explores the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
digitization to enhance the accuracy of scaffolding inspection and contribute
to the safety improvement. A cloud-based AI platform is developed to process
and analyse the point cloud data of scaffolding structure. The proposed system
detects structural modifications through comparison and evaluation of certified
reference data with the recent point cloud data. This approach may enable
automated monitoring of scaffolding, reducing the time and effort required for
manual inspections while enhancing the safety on a construction site.

*Aleksa Jelaca,Ying Jiao,Chang Tian,Marie-Francine Moens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出自动提示工程框架，通过图像评估器、监督提示重写器和DPO排序器，实现反事实尺寸控制（如生成微小海象和巨大按钮），构建首个反事实尺寸文本-图像数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像生成中细粒度可控性的关键挑战，特别是反事实可控性（生成违背常识模式的图像），这对创造性和探索性应用至关重要。

Method: 包含三个组件：图像评估器指导数据集构建，监督提示重写器生成修订提示，DPO训练的排序器选择最优修订提示。扩展Grounded SAM以改进图像评估器。

Result: 图像评估器性能比其骨干网络提升114%，实验表明该方法优于最先进基线和ChatGPT-4o。

Conclusion: 为反事实可控性的未来研究奠定了基础，展示了在反事实尺寸控制方面的有效性。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation has advanced rapidly with large-scale multimodal
training, yet fine-grained controllability remains a critical challenge.
Counterfactual controllability, defined as the capacity to deliberately
generate images that contradict common-sense patterns, remains a major
challenge but plays a crucial role in enabling creativity and exploratory
applications. In this work, we address this gap with a focus on counterfactual
size (e.g., generating a tiny walrus beside a giant button) and propose an
automatic prompt engineering framework that adapts base prompts into revised
prompts for counterfactual images. The framework comprises three components: an
image evaluator that guides dataset construction by identifying successful
image generations, a supervised prompt rewriter that produces revised prompts,
and a DPO-trained ranker that selects the optimal revised prompt. We construct
the first counterfactual size text-image dataset and enhance the image
evaluator by extending Grounded SAM with refinements, achieving a 114 percent
improvement over its backbone. Experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and ChatGPT-4o, establishing a
foundation for future research on counterfactual controllability.

*Shiraz S Kaderuppan,Jonathan Mar,Andrew Irvine,Anurag Sharma,Muhammad Ramadan Saifuddin,Wai Leong Eugene Wong,Wai Lok Woo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了两种深度神经网络架构(O-Net和Theta-Net)在非荧光相位调制显微镜下实现超分辨率成像的能力，发现它们在不同信噪比条件下具有互补性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决光学显微镜横向分辨率限制(~200nm)的问题，避免使用昂贵的外部模块或特殊技术，为普通显微镜用户提供经济可行的超分辨率解决方案。

Method: 使用两种自开发的深度神经网络架构(O-Net和Theta-Net)，在非荧光相位调制显微镜模式(如Zernike相差和微分干涉对比)下，对经原子力显微镜校准的纳米级特征测试靶进行超分辨率重建。

Result: 两种网络都能很好地实现超分辨率成像，但具有互补性：高信噪比图像适合O-Net模型，低信噪比图像更适合Theta-Net模型。

Conclusion: 模型架构与源图像信噪比的结合对深度神经网络在非荧光光学纳米显微镜中的性能至关重要，即使使用相同的训练数据集和训练周期。

Abstract: The field of optical microscopy spans across numerous industries and research
domains, ranging from education to healthcare, quality inspection and analysis.
Nonetheless, a key limitation often cited by optical microscopists refers to
the limit of its lateral resolution (typically defined as ~200nm), with
potential circumventions involving either costly external modules (e.g.
confocal scan heads, etc) and/or specialized techniques [e.g. super-resolution
(SR) fluorescent microscopy]. Addressing these challenges in a normal
(non-specialist) context thus remains an aspect outside the scope of most
microscope users & facilities. This study thus seeks to evaluate an alternative
& economical approach to achieving SR optical microscopy, involving
non-fluorescent phase-modulated microscopical modalities such as Zernike phase
contrast (PCM) and differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. Two in
silico deep neural network (DNN) architectures which we developed previously
(termed O-Net and Theta-Net) are assessed on their abilities to resolve a
custom-fabricated test target containing nanoscale features calibrated via
atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results of our study demonstrate that
although both O-Net and Theta-Net seemingly performed well when super-resolving
these images, they were complementary (rather than competing) approaches to be
considered for image SR, particularly under different image signal-to-noise
ratios (SNRs). High image SNRs favoured the application of O-Net models, while
low SNRs inclined preferentially towards Theta-Net models. These findings
demonstrate the importance of model architectures (in conjunction with the
source image SNR) on model performance and the SR quality of the generated
images where DNN models are utilized for non-fluorescent optical nanoscopy,
even where the same training dataset & number of epochs are being used.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DMTF-AVN方法，通过多目标架构和Transformer机制实现视听导航中的动态多模态融合，在Replica和Matterport3D数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视听导航方法仅进行基础的视听数据融合，忽视了更深层次的感知上下文，需要更有效的多模态线索利用方法。

Method: 使用多目标架构配合改进的Transformer机制，对跨模态信息进行过滤和选择性融合。

Result: 在Replica和Matterport3D数据集上实现了最先进的性能，在成功率(SR)、路径效率(SPL)和场景适应性(SNA)方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该模型展现出强大的可扩展性和泛化能力，为机器人导航中的先进多模态融合策略开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Audiovisual embodied navigation enables robots to locate audio sources by
dynamically integrating visual observations from onboard sensors with the
auditory signals emitted by the target. The core challenge lies in effectively
leveraging multimodal cues to guide navigation. While prior works have explored
basic fusion of visual and audio data, they often overlook deeper perceptual
context. To address this, we propose the Dynamic Multi-Target Fusion for
Efficient Audio-Visual Navigation (DMTF-AVN). Our approach uses a multi-target
architecture coupled with a refined Transformer mechanism to filter and
selectively fuse cross-modal information. Extensive experiments on the Replica
and Matterport3D datasets demonstrate that DMTF-AVN achieves state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods in success rate (SR), path
efficiency (SPL), and scene adaptation (SNA). Furthermore, the model exhibits
strong scalability and generalizability, paving the way for advanced multimodal
fusion strategies in robotic navigation. The code and videos are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAEmnesia是一种监督式稀疏自编码器训练方法，通过系统化概念标注促进一对一的概念-神经元映射，显著减少文本到图像扩散模型中概念遗忘所需的超参数搜索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏自编码器虽然减少了神经元的多义性，但单个概念表示仍分布在多个潜在特征中，需要大量搜索过程来实现概念遗忘。

Method: 引入监督式稀疏自编码器训练方法，通过系统化概念标注缓解特征分裂并促进特征集中化，学习具有更强概念关联的专用神经元。

Result: 在推理时，这种可解释表示将超参数搜索减少了96.67%；在UnlearnCanvas基准上比现有技术提高了9.22%；在顺序遗忘任务中，9对象移除的遗忘准确率提高了28.4%。

Conclusion: SAEmnesia通过促进一对一的概念-神经元映射，显著提高了概念遗忘的效率和准确性，具有优越的可扩展性。

Abstract: Effective concept unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models requires
precise localization of concept representations within the model's latent
space. While sparse autoencoders successfully reduce neuron polysemanticity
(i.e., multiple concepts per neuron) compared to the original network,
individual concept representations can still be distributed across multiple
latent features, requiring extensive search procedures for concept unlearning.
We introduce SAEmnesia, a supervised sparse autoencoder training method that
promotes one-to-one concept-neuron mappings through systematic concept
labeling, mitigating feature splitting and promoting feature centralization.
Our approach learns specialized neurons with significantly stronger concept
associations compared to unsupervised baselines. The only computational
overhead introduced by SAEmnesia is limited to cross-entropy computation during
training. At inference time, this interpretable representation reduces
hyperparameter search by 96.67% with respect to current approaches. On the
UnlearnCanvas benchmark, SAEmnesia achieves a 9.22% improvement over the
state-of-the-art. In sequential unlearning tasks, we demonstrate superior
scalability with a 28.4% improvement in unlearning accuracy for 9-object
removal.

Abstract: Deep Learning models have transformed various domains, including the
healthcare sector, particularly biomedical image classification by learning
intricate features and enabling accurate diagnostics pertaining to complex
diseases. Recent studies have adopted two different approaches to train DL
models: training from scratch and transfer learning. Both approaches demand
substantial computational time and resources due to the involvement of massive
datasets in model training. These computational demands are further increased
due to the design-space exploration required for selecting optimal
hyperparameters, which typically necessitates several training rounds. With the
growing sizes of datasets, exploring solutions to this problem has recently
gained the research community's attention. A plausible solution is to select a
subset of the dataset for training and hyperparameter search. This subset,
referred to as the corset, must be a representative set of the original
dataset. A straightforward approach to selecting the coreset could be employing
random sampling, albeit at the cost of compromising the representativeness of
the original dataset. A critical limitation of random sampling is the bias
towards the dominant classes in an imbalanced dataset. Even if the dataset has
inter-class balance, this random sampling will not capture intra-class
diversity. This study addresses this issue by introducing an intelligent,
lightweight mechanism for coreset selection. Specifically, it proposes a method
to extract intra-class diversity, forming per-class clusters that are utilized
for the final sampling. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology
by conducting extensive classification experiments on a well-known biomedical
imaging dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the
random sampling approach on several performance metrics for uniform conditions.

*Manel Rakez,Thomas Louis,Julien Guillaumin,Foucauld Chamming's,Pierre Fillard,Brice Amadeo,Virginie Rondeau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LongiMam是一个端到端的深度学习模型，整合当前和最多4次既往乳腺X光片，通过卷积神经网络和循环神经网络捕捉空间和时间模式，显著提升乳腺癌预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习模型大多使用单次或有限次数的既往乳腺X光片，缺乏对现实世界不平衡结果分布和异质性随访的适应性。

Method: 开发LongiMam模型，结合卷积神经网络捕捉空间特征和循环神经网络捕捉时间模式，使用基于人群的大规模筛查数据集进行训练和评估。

Result: 在多种场景下，包含既往乳腺X光片均能持续改善预测性能，结合既往和当前访视的表现优于单次访视模型。在乳腺密度随时间变化的女性中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 纵向建模增强乳腺癌预测能力，支持在筛查项目中使用重复乳腺X光片来完善风险分层。LongiMam已作为开源软件公开可用。

Abstract: Risk-adapted breast cancer screening requires robust models that leverage
longitudinal imaging data. Most current deep learning models use single or
limited prior mammograms and lack adaptation for real-world settings marked by
imbalanced outcome distribution and heterogeneous follow-up. We developed
LongiMam, an end-to-end deep learning model that integrates both current and up
to four prior mammograms. LongiMam combines a convolutional and a recurrent
neural network to capture spatial and temporal patterns predictive of breast
cancer. The model was trained and evaluated using a large, population-based
screening dataset with disproportionate case-to-control ratio typical of
clinical screening. Across several scenarios that varied in the number and
composition of prior exams, LongiMam consistently improved prediction when
prior mammograms were included. The addition of prior and current visits
outperformed single-visit models, while priors alone performed less well,
highlighting the importance of combining historical and recent information.
Subgroup analyses confirmed the model's efficacy across key risk groups,
including women with dense breasts and those aged 55 years or older. Moreover,
the model performed best in women with observed changes in mammographic density
over time. These findings demonstrate that longitudinal modeling enhances
breast cancer prediction and support the use of repeated mammograms to refine
risk stratification in screening programs. LongiMam is publicly available as
open-source software.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究探索了CNN与人类大脑在社交认知任务中的对应关系，发现CNN难以超越简单视觉处理，无法反映高阶脑处理过程，并提出了Object2Brain框架来分析不同物体类别对CNN-人类相关性的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然CNN在视觉感知方面与人类大脑存在对应关系，但这些对应关系主要研究一般视觉感知。本研究旨在探索这种对应关系是否也适用于更复杂的大脑过程——社交认知。

Method: 通过相关性分析评估流行CNN架构与人类行为和fMRI数据在图像情感评估任务中的对齐程度，并提出了Object2Brain框架，结合GradCAM和物体检测来分析不同物体类别对相关性的影响。

Result: CNN在处理社交认知任务时难以超越简单视觉处理，无法反映高阶脑处理过程；不同CNN架构显示出不同的物体类别敏感性，尽管相关性趋势相似。

Conclusion: CNN在社交认知任务中与人类大脑的对应关系有限，主要停留在简单视觉处理层面，无法捕捉更高阶的脑处理过程。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a popular type of computer model
that have proven their worth in many computer vision tasks. Moreover, they form
an interesting study object for the field of psychology, with shown
correspondences between the workings of CNNs and the human brain. However,
these correspondences have so far mostly been studied in the context of general
visual perception. In contrast, this paper explores to what extent this
correspondence also holds for a more complex brain process, namely social
cognition. To this end, we assess the alignment between popular CNN
architectures and both human behavioral and fMRI data for image valence
appraisal through a correlation analysis. We show that for this task CNNs
struggle to go beyond simple visual processing, and do not seem to reflect
higher-order brain processing. Furthermore, we present Object2Brain, a novel
framework that combines GradCAM and object detection at the CNN-filter level
with the aforementioned correlation analysis to study the influence of
different object classes on the CNN-to-human correlations. Despite similar
correlation trends, different CNN architectures are shown to display different
object class sensitivities.

### [17] [Debugging Concept Bottleneck Models through Removal and Retraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21385)
*Eric Enouen,Sainyam Galhotra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个可解释的调试框架CBDebug，通过移除和重新训练两个步骤来修复概念瓶颈模型中的系统性偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的概念干预方法无法解决模型与专家推理之间的系统性偏差问题，比如模型从有偏数据中学习捷径。

Method: 采用移除和重新训练两步骤：移除步骤中专家识别并删除不期望的概念；重新训练步骤中CBDebug方法将概念级用户反馈转换为样本级辅助标签，应用监督偏差缓解和针对性增强。

Result: CBDebug在多个CBM架构和基准测试中显著优于先前的重新训练方法。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效减少模型对不期望概念的依赖，提高模型的可靠性和可解释性。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) use a set of human-interpretable concepts to
predict the final task label, enabling domain experts to not only validate the
CBM's predictions, but also intervene on incorrect concepts at test time.
However, these interventions fail to address systemic misalignment between the
CBM and the expert's reasoning, such as when the model learns shortcuts from
biased data. To address this, we present a general interpretable debugging
framework for CBMs that follows a two-step process of Removal and Retraining.
In the Removal step, experts use concept explanations to identify and remove
any undesired concepts. In the Retraining step, we introduce CBDebug, a novel
method that leverages the interpretability of CBMs as a bridge for converting
concept-level user feedback into sample-level auxiliary labels. These labels
are then used to apply supervised bias mitigation and targeted augmentation,
reducing the model's reliance on undesired concepts. We evaluate our framework
with both real and automated expert feedback, and find that CBDebug
significantly outperforms prior retraining methods across multiple CBM
architectures (PIP-Net, Post-hoc CBM) and benchmarks with known spurious
correlations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WAVE是首个基于LLM的统一音频-视觉嵌入模型，通过分层特征融合和多任务训练，实现了文本、音频、视频三模态的统一表示空间，支持任意模态间的跨模态检索和指令感知嵌入生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然多模态大语言模型的嵌入作为通用表示表现优异，但在动态模态（如音频和视频）中的应用仍未被充分探索。需要创建统一的表示空间来支持文本、音频和视频模态的任意跨模态应用。

Method: 采用新颖的分层特征融合策略和联合多模态多任务训练方法，实现两种关键能力：任意模态间的跨模态检索，以及根据用户指令生成提示感知嵌入。

Result: 在MMEB-v2视频基准测试中创下新纪录，在音频和视频到音频检索中取得优异结果。提示感知特性在多模态问答中表现突出，显著优于现有嵌入模型。消融研究验证了联合训练策略的有效性。

Conclusion: WAVE通过引入新的通用音频-视觉学习基准，为跨模态任意应用开辟了广阔可能性，代码、检查点和数据将公开发布。

Abstract: While embeddings from multimodal large language models (LLMs) excel as
general-purpose representations, their application to dynamic modalities like
audio and video remains underexplored. We introduce WAVE (\textbf{u}nified \&
\textbf{v}ersatile \textbf{a}udio-\textbf{v}isual \textbf{e}mbeddings), the
first LLM-based embedding that creates a unified representation space for text,
audio, and video modalities. WAVE employs a novel hierarchical feature fusion
strategy and a joint multi-modal, multi-task training approach to enable two
key capabilities: any-to-any cross-modal retrieval and the generation of
prompt-aware embeddings tailored to user instructions. Experimentally, WAVE
sets a new state-of-the-art on the MMEB-v2 video benchmark and achieves
superior results in audio and video-to-audio retrieval. Its prompt-aware nature
also yields remarkable performance in multimodal question answering,
significantly outperforming existing embedding models. Ablation studies
validate our joint training strategy, demonstrating improved performance across
all modalities. With a newly introduced benchmark for versatile audio-visual
learning, WAVE opens up broad possibilities for cross-modal, any-to-any
applications. Our code, checkpoints, and data will be released.

TL;DR: ShipwreckFinder是一个开源的QGIS插件，使用深度学习从多波束声纳数据中自动检测沉船，通过数据预处理、模型推理和阈值处理生成沉船的分割掩码或边界框。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 沉船是海上历史的重要标记，但通过人工检查测深数据来发现沉船耗时且需要专家分析，因此需要自动化工具来提高效率。

Method: 开发基于深度学习的开源工具，使用来自大湖区和爱尔兰海岸的沉船数据进行训练，并采用合成数据生成来增加数据集规模和多样性。

Result: 与基于深度学习的ArcGIS工具包和传统的逆沉洞检测方法相比，该工具在分割性能上表现更优。

Conclusion: ShipwreckFinder提供了一个有效的自动化沉船检测解决方案，其开源代码可在GitHub上获取。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce ShipwreckFinder, an open-source QGIS plugin that
detects shipwrecks from multibeam sonar data. Shipwrecks are an important
historical marker of maritime history, and can be discovered through manual
inspection of bathymetric data. However, this is a time-consuming process and
often requires expert analysis. Our proposed tool allows users to automatically
preprocess bathymetry data, perform deep learning inference, threshold model
outputs, and produce either pixel-wise segmentation masks or bounding boxes of
predicted shipwrecks. The backbone of this open-source tool is a deep learning
model, which is trained on a variety of shipwreck data from the Great Lakes and
the coasts of Ireland. Additionally, we employ synthetic data generation in
order to increase the size and diversity of our dataset. We demonstrate
superior segmentation performance with our open-source tool and training
pipeline as compared to a deep learning-based ArcGIS toolkit and a more
classical inverse sinkhole detection method. The open-source tool can be found
at https://github.com/umfieldrobotics/ShipwreckFinderQGISPlugin.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAVIS是一个基于扩散模型的音频-视觉分离框架，通过生成式学习方法解决音频-视觉声源分离任务，超越了传统基于掩码的回归方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将声音分离视为基于掩码的回归问题，在捕捉复杂数据分布以高质量分离不同类别声音方面存在局限性。

Method: 利用去噪扩散概率模型(DDPM)和流匹配(FM)等生成建模范式，在专门的分离U-Net架构中，从噪声分布合成分离后的声音频谱图，同时以混合音频输入和相关视觉信息为条件。

Result: 在标准AVE和MUSIC数据集上的比较评估表明，DAVIS的DDPM和流匹配变体在分离质量上都超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: 生成式框架对于处理音频-视觉源分离任务具有显著效果，能够产生高质量的声音分离结果。

Abstract: We propose DAVIS, a Diffusion-based Audio-VIsual Separation framework that
solves the audio-visual sound source separation task through generative
learning. Existing methods typically frame sound separation as a mask-based
regression problem, achieving significant progress. However, they face
limitations in capturing the complex data distribution required for
high-quality separation of sounds from diverse categories. In contrast, DAVIS
circumvents these issues by leveraging potent generative modeling paradigms,
specifically Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and the more
recent Flow Matching (FM), integrated within a specialized Separation U-Net
architecture. Our framework operates by synthesizing the desired separated
sound spectrograms directly from a noise distribution, conditioned concurrently
on the mixed audio input and associated visual information. The inherent nature
of its generative objective makes DAVIS particularly adept at producing
high-quality sound separations for diverse sound categories. We present
comparative evaluations of DAVIS, encompassing both its DDPM and Flow Matching
variants, against leading methods on the standard AVE and MUSIC datasets. The
results affirm that both variants surpass existing approaches in separation
quality, highlighting the efficacy of our generative framework for tackling the
audio-visual source separation task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了基于幅度的剪枝对神经网络可解释性的影响，发现轻中度剪枝能改善显著性图的聚焦性和忠实度，而过度剪枝会降低概念语义一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究表明神经网络可以在保持性能的同时大幅剪枝，但剪枝对模型可解释性的影响尚不清楚。

Method: 使用在ImageNette上训练的ResNet-18，比较不同剪枝水平下Vanilla Gradients和Integrated Gradients的后验解释，评估稀疏性和忠实度，并应用CRAFT概念提取跟踪学习概念的语义一致性变化。

Result: 轻中度剪枝改善了显著性图的聚焦性和忠实度，同时保留了清晰、语义有意义的概念；而过度剪枝会合并异质特征，降低显著性图稀疏性和概念一致性，尽管仍保持准确率。

Conclusion: 剪枝可以使内部表示更符合人类注意力模式，但过度剪枝会损害可解释性。

Abstract: Prior works have shown that neural networks can be heavily pruned while
preserving performance, but the impact of pruning on model interpretability
remains unclear. In this work, we investigate how magnitude-based pruning
followed by fine-tuning affects both low-level saliency maps and high-level
concept representations. Using a ResNet-18 trained on ImageNette, we compare
post-hoc explanations from Vanilla Gradients (VG) and Integrated Gradients (IG)
across pruning levels, evaluating sparsity and faithfulness. We further apply
CRAFT-based concept extraction to track changes in semantic coherence of
learned concepts. Our results show that light-to-moderate pruning improves
saliency-map focus and faithfulness while retaining distinct, semantically
meaningful concepts. In contrast, aggressive pruning merges heterogeneous
features, reducing saliency map sparsity and concept coherence despite
maintaining accuracy. These findings suggest that while pruning can shape
internal representations toward more human-aligned attention patterns,
excessive pruning undermines interpretability.

TL;DR: TUN3D是首个基于多视图图像输入、无需真实相机位姿或深度监督的联合布局估计和3D物体检测方法，在三个场景理解基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖点云输入的局限性，因为大多数消费级相机缺乏深度传感器，而纯视觉数据更为常见。

Method: 基于轻量级稀疏卷积骨干网络，采用两个专用头：一个用于3D物体检测，一个用于布局估计，利用新颖有效的参数化墙壁表示。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的场景理解基准测试中达到最先进性能：(i)使用真实点云，(ii)使用有姿态图像，(iii)使用无姿态图像。在3D物体检测方面与专用方法相当，在布局估计方面显著推进。

Conclusion: TUN3D为整体室内场景理解设立了新基准，能够从多视图图像创建紧凑且语义丰富的空间表示。

Abstract: Layout estimation and 3D object detection are two fundamental tasks in indoor
scene understanding. When combined, they enable the creation of a compact yet
semantically rich spatial representation of a scene. Existing approaches
typically rely on point cloud input, which poses a major limitation since most
consumer cameras lack depth sensors and visual-only data remains far more
common. We address this issue with TUN3D, the first method that tackles joint
layout estimation and 3D object detection in real scans, given multi-view
images as input, and does not require ground-truth camera poses or depth
supervision. Our approach builds on a lightweight sparse-convolutional backbone
and employs two dedicated heads: one for 3D object detection and one for layout
estimation, leveraging a novel and effective parametric wall representation.
Extensive experiments show that TUN3D achieves state-of-the-art performance
across three challenging scene understanding benchmarks: (i) using ground-truth
point clouds, (ii) using posed images, and (iii) using unposed images. While
performing on par with specialized 3D object detection methods, TUN3D
significantly advances layout estimation, setting a new benchmark in holistic
indoor scene understanding. Code is available at

TL;DR: UISim是一个基于图像的UI模拟器，通过两阶段方法从屏幕图像预测UI布局并合成新图像，实现动态UI交互模拟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖物理设备或静态截图分析，难以进行可扩展的UI测试和智能UI代理训练。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：给定初始屏幕图像和用户操作，先预测下一个UI状态的抽象布局，然后基于预测布局合成视觉一致的新图像。

Result: UISim在生成真实连贯的后续UI状态方面优于端到端UI生成基线方法。

Conclusion: UISim为UI测试、快速原型设计和合成数据生成提供了实用价值，并为AI代理的UI导航任务规划等高级应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Developing and testing user interfaces (UIs) and training AI agents to
interact with them are challenging due to the dynamic and diverse nature of
real-world mobile environments. Existing methods often rely on cumbersome
physical devices or limited static analysis of screenshots, which hinders
scalable testing and the development of intelligent UI agents. We introduce
UISim, a novel image-based UI simulator that offers a dynamic and interactive
platform for exploring mobile phone environments purely from screen images. Our
system employs a two-stage method: given an initial phone screen image and a
user action, it first predicts the abstract layout of the next UI state, then
synthesizes a new, visually consistent image based on this predicted layout.
This approach enables the realistic simulation of UI transitions. UISim
provides immediate practical benefits for UI testing, rapid prototyping, and
synthetic data generation. Furthermore, its interactive capabilities pave the
way for advanced applications, such as UI navigation task planning for AI
agents. Our experimental results show that UISim outperforms end-to-end UI
generation baselines in generating realistic and coherent subsequent UI states,
highlighting its fidelity and potential to streamline UI development and
enhance AI agent training.

Conclusion: 该系统在图像传输任务中表现出有效性，能够在不牺牲性能的情况下显著提升资源利用率。

Abstract: The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has
introduced significant opportunities for enhancing the efficiency and accuracy
of image transmission within semantic communication systems. Despite these
advancements, existing methodologies often neglect the difference in importance
of different regions of the image, potentially compromising the reconstruction
quality of visually critical content. To address this issue, we introduce an
innovative generative semantic communication system that refines semantic
granularity by segmenting images into key and non-key regions. Key regions,
which contain essential visual information, are processed using an image
oriented semantic encoder, while non-key regions are efficiently compressed
through an image-to-text modeling approach. Additionally, to mitigate the
substantial storage and computational demands posed by large AI models, the
proposed system employs a lightweight deployment strategy incorporating model
quantization and low-rank adaptation fine-tuning techniques, significantly
boosting resource utilization without sacrificing performance. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms traditional methods in
terms of both semantic fidelity and visual quality, thereby affirming its
effectiveness for image transmission tasks.

Result: 概念验证实验表明该框架在鲁棒骨架化、形状压缩和增材制造刚度增强等任务中有效。

Conclusion: 骨架化尺度空间为形状分析提供了理论严谨且实用的层次简化工具，扩展了传统骨架表示的能力。

Abstract: The Hamilton-Jacobi skeleton, also known as the medial axis, is a powerful
shape descriptor that represents binary objects in terms of the centres of
maximal inscribed discs. Despite its broad applicability, the medial axis
suffers from sensitivity to noise: minor boundary variations can lead to
disproportionately large and undesirable expansions of the skeleton. Classical
pruning methods mitigate this shortcoming by systematically removing extraneous
skeletal branches. This sequential simplification of skeletons resembles the
principle of sparsification scale-spaces that embed images into a family of
reconstructions from increasingly sparse pixel representations.
  We combine both worlds by introducing skeletonisation scale-spaces: They
leverage sparsification of the medial axis to achieve hierarchical
simplification of shapes. Unlike conventional pruning, our framework inherently
satisfies key scale-space properties such as hierarchical architecture,
controllable simplification, and equivariance to geometric transformations. We
provide a rigorous theoretical foundation in both continuous and discrete
formulations and extend the concept further with densification. This allows
inverse progression from coarse to fine scales and can even reach beyond the
original skeleton to produce overcomplete shape representations with relevancy
for practical applications.
  Through proof-of-concept experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework for practical tasks including robust skeletonisation, shape
compression, and stiffness enhancement for additive manufacturing.

Conclusion: 单图像超分辨率模型可以有效提升气候预测的空间分辨率，为地方决策提供更精细的气候信息。

Abstract: High-resolution climate projections are essential for local decision-making.
However, available climate projections have low spatial resolution (e.g. 12.5
km), which limits their usability. We address this limitation by leveraging
single-image super-resolution models to statistically downscale climate
projections to 1-km resolution. Since high-resolution climate projections are
unavailable for training, we train models on a high-resolution observational
gridded data set and apply them to low-resolution climate projections. We
propose a climate indicator-based assessment using observed climate indices
computed at weather station locations to evaluate the downscaled climate
projections without ground-truth high-resolution climate projections.
Experiments on daily mean temperature demonstrate that single-image
super-resolution models can downscale climate projections without increasing
the error of climate indicators compared to low-resolution climate projections.

*Md Jueal Mia,M. Hadi Amini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出JaiLIP方法，通过在图像空间进行损失引导的扰动，有效破解视觉语言模型的安全对齐，生成有害输出且扰动不易察觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型存在被图像扰动攻击的风险，现有破解方法性能不稳定且扰动明显，需要更有效的攻击方法。

Method: 使用联合目标函数，结合干净图像与对抗图像的均方误差损失和模型有害输出损失，在图像空间进行最小化优化。

Result: 实验表明该方法生成的对抗图像高度有效且不易察觉，在毒性指标上优于现有方法，在交通领域也展示了实用性。

Conclusion: 图像基础的破解攻击具有实际挑战性，需要为视觉语言模型开发有效的防御机制。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have remarkable abilities in generating
multimodal reasoning tasks. However, potential misuse or safety alignment
concerns of VLMs have increased significantly due to different categories of
attack vectors. Among various attack vectors, recent studies have demonstrated
that image-based perturbations are particularly effective in generating harmful
outputs. In the literature, many existing techniques have been proposed to
jailbreak VLMs, leading to unstable performance and visible perturbations. In
this study, we propose Jailbreaking with Loss-guided Image Perturbation
(JaiLIP), a jailbreaking attack in the image space that minimizes a joint
objective combining the mean squared error (MSE) loss between clean and
adversarial image with the models harmful-output loss. We evaluate our proposed
method on VLMs using standard toxicity metrics from Perspective API and
Detoxify. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates highly
effective and imperceptible adversarial images, outperforming existing methods
in producing toxicity. Moreover, we have evaluated our method in the
transportation domain to demonstrate the attacks practicality beyond toxic text
generation in specific domain. Our findings emphasize the practical challenges
of image-based jailbreak attacks and the need for efficient defense mechanisms
for VLMs.

Motivation: 量化自动植物识别系统与人类专家在物种识别方面的性能差距，比较两者在不确定性处理上的表现，这对计算机科学家和自然学家都具有重要意义。

Method: 设计了ExpertCLEF挑战赛，评估了4个研究团队的19个深度学习系统，并与9位法国植物学专家进行对比评估。

Result: 最先进的深度学习模型在植物识别任务上的性能已接近最先进的人类专家水平。

Conclusion: 深度学习在植物自动识别方面取得了显著进展，性能已接近人类专家，但仍需考虑专家在物种识别中的不确定性和分歧问题。

Abstract: Automated identification of plants and animals has improved considerably in
the last few years, in particular thanks to the recent advances in deep
learning. The next big question is how far such automated systems are from the
human expertise. Indeed, even the best experts are sometimes confused and/or
disagree between each others when validating visual or audio observations of
living organism. A picture actually contains only a partial information that is
usually not sufficient to determine the right species with certainty.
Quantifying this uncertainty and comparing it to the performance of automated
systems is of high interest for both computer scientists and expert
naturalists. The LifeCLEF 2018 ExpertCLEF challenge presented in this paper was
designed to allow this comparison between human experts and automated systems.
In total, 19 deep-learning systems implemented by 4 different research teams
were evaluated with regard to 9 expert botanists of the French flora. The main
outcome of this work is that the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning
models is now close to the most advanced human expertise. This paper presents
more precisely the resources and assessments of the challenge, summarizes the
approaches and systems employed by the participating research groups, and
provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QuadGPT是首个端到端的自回归四边形网格生成框架，通过序列预测范式直接生成四边形网格，避免了传统三角形到四边形转换方法导致的拓扑质量问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成方法先生成三角形网格再合并为四边形，这通常会产生拓扑质量较差的四边形网格。需要开发能够直接生成高质量四边形网格的端到端方法。

Method: 采用自回归框架，将四边形网格生成建模为序列预测问题。关键创新包括：处理三角形和四边形混合拓扑的统一标记化方法，以及用于提升生成质量的专门强化学习微调方法tDPO。

Result: 大量实验表明，QuadGPT在几何精度和拓扑质量上都显著超越了之前的三角形到四边形转换流程。

Conclusion: 这项工作为原生四边形网格生成设立了新基准，展示了将大规模自回归模型与拓扑感知强化学习精炼相结合在创建结构化3D资源方面的强大能力。

Abstract: The generation of quadrilateral-dominant meshes is a cornerstone of
professional 3D content creation. However, existing generative models generate
quad meshes by first generating triangle meshes and then merging triangles into
quadrilaterals with some specific rules, which typically produces quad meshes
with poor topology. In this paper, we introduce QuadGPT, the first
autoregressive framework for generating quadrilateral meshes in an end-to-end
manner. QuadGPT formulates this as a sequence prediction paradigm,
distinguished by two key innovations: a unified tokenization method to handle
mixed topologies of triangles and quadrilaterals, and a specialized
Reinforcement Learning fine-tuning method tDPO for better generation quality.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that QuadGPT significantly surpasses previous
triangle-to-quad conversion pipelines in both geometric accuracy and
topological quality. Our work establishes a new benchmark for native quad-mesh
generation and showcases the power of combining large-scale autoregressive
models with topology-aware RL refinement for creating structured 3D assets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DyME是一个按需概念擦除框架，通过训练轻量级的概念特定LoRA适配器，在推理时动态组合所需适配器，实现灵活的多概念擦除。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型会无意中复制受版权保护的风格和视觉概念，引发法律和伦理问题。现有擦除方法无法扩展到需要擦除多个可能冲突概念的实用场景。

Method: 训练概念特定的LoRA适配器，在推理时动态组合所需适配器；引入双层正交性约束（特征级和参数级）来解耦表示偏移并强制正交适配器子空间。

Result: 在ErasureBench-H和标准数据集上的实验表明，DyME持续优于现有最先进基线，实现了更高的多概念擦除保真度和最小的附带退化。

Conclusion: DyME通过动态组合和正交约束，有效解决了多概念擦除中的干扰问题，为实际应用提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) inadvertently reproduce copyrighted
styles and protected visual concepts, raising legal and ethical concerns.
Concept erasure has emerged as a safeguard, aiming to selectively suppress such
concepts through fine-tuning. However, existing methods do not scale to
practical settings where providers must erase multiple and possibly conflicting
concepts. The core bottleneck is their reliance on static erasure: a single
checkpoint is fine-tuned to remove all target concepts, regardless of the
actual erasure needs at inference. This rigid design mismatches real-world
usage, where requests vary per generation, leading to degraded erasure success
and reduced fidelity for non-target content. We propose DyME, an on-demand
erasure framework that trains lightweight, concept-specific LoRA adapters and
dynamically composes only those needed at inference. This modular design
enables flexible multi-concept erasure, but naive composition causes
interference among adapters, especially when many or semantically related
concepts are suppressed. To overcome this, we introduce bi-level orthogonality
constraints at both the feature and parameter levels, disentangling
representation shifts and enforcing orthogonal adapter subspaces. We further
develop ErasureBench-H, a new hierarchical benchmark with
brand-series-character structure, enabling principled evaluation across
semantic granularities and erasure set sizes. Experiments on ErasureBench-H and
standard datasets (e.g., CIFAR-100, Imagenette) demonstrate that DyME
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher
multi-concept erasure fidelity with minimal collateral degradation.

TL;DR: VideoJudge是一个专门用于评估视频理解模型输出的多模态大语言模型，通过生成器-评估器交互训练，在多个基准测试中超越了更大的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标无法准确反映人类判断的精细度，而人工评估成本高昂，需要开发专门针对视频理解任务的自动化评估方法。

Method: 使用生成器-评估器交互训练方法：生成器根据目标评分生成响应，不匹配评估器评分的响应被丢弃，从而训练专门的多模态大语言模型评估器。

Result: VideoJudge-7B在四个元评估基准中的三个上超越了更大的MLLM基线模型（如Qwen2.5-VL 32B和72B），发现视频输入对评估视频理解任务至关重要。

Conclusion: 提供视频输入对于评估视频理解任务至关重要，多模态评估器比纯语言模型评估器表现更好，长链思维推理并不能改善性能。

Abstract: Precisely evaluating video understanding models remains challenging: commonly
used metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore fail to capture the fineness of
human judgment, while obtaining such judgments through manual evaluation is
costly. Recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) or
multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as evaluators, but their extension to video
understanding remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we introduce
VideoJudge, a 3B and 7B-sized MLLM judge specialized to evaluate outputs from
video understanding models (\textit{i.e.}, text responses conditioned on
videos). To train VideoJudge, our recipe builds on the interplay between a
generator and an evaluator: the generator is prompted to produce responses
conditioned on a target rating, and responses not matching the evaluator's
rating are discarded. Across three out of four meta-evaluation benchmarks,
VideoJudge-7B outperforms larger MLLM judge baselines such as Qwen2.5-VL (32B
and 72B). Notably, we find that LLM judges (Qwen3) models perform worse than
MLLM judges (Qwen2.5-VL) and long chain-of-thought reasoning does not improve
performance, indicating that providing video inputs is crucial for evaluation
of video understanding tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReVQom是一个用于多智能体协同感知的端到端特征压缩方法，通过瓶颈网络和多阶段残差向量量化将特征从8192 bpp压缩到6-30 bpp，在DAIR-V2X数据集上实现273-1365倍压缩，在18 bpp时性能匹配或优于原始特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体协同感知通过共享信息提升场景理解能力，但通信带宽限制了系统可扩展性，需要高效的压缩方法来减少传输负载。

Method: 使用端到端方法，先通过简单瓶颈网络压缩特征维度，然后采用多阶段残差向量量化，仅传输每个像素的代码索引。

Result: 在DAIR-V2X真实世界CP数据集上，ReVQom实现273倍压缩（30 bpp）到1365倍压缩（6 bpp），在18 bpp时性能匹配或优于原始特征CP，在6-12 bpp时支持超低带宽操作且性能下降平缓。

Conclusion: ReVQom能够实现高效准确的多智能体协同感知，向实用的V2X部署迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Multi-agent collaborative perception (CP) improves scene understanding by
sharing information across connected agents such as autonomous vehicles,
unmanned aerial vehicles, and robots. Communication bandwidth, however,
constrains scalability. We present ReVQom, a learned feature codec that
preserves spatial identity while compressing intermediate features. ReVQom is
an end-to-end method that compresses feature dimensions via a simple bottleneck
network followed by multi-stage residual vector quantization (RVQ). This allows
only per-pixel code indices to be transmitted, reducing payloads from 8192 bits
per pixel (bpp) of uncompressed 32-bit float features to 6-30 bpp per agent
with minimal accuracy loss. On DAIR-V2X real-world CP dataset, ReVQom achieves
273x compression at 30 bpp to 1365x compression at 6 bpp. At 18 bpp (455x),
ReVQom matches or outperforms raw-feature CP, and at 6-12 bpp it enables
ultra-low-bandwidth operation with graceful degradation. ReVQom allows
efficient and accurate multi-agent collaborative perception with a step toward
practical V2X deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究分析了三种文本到图像AI模型在生成沙特阿拉伯职业图像时存在的性别刻板印象和文化不准确性，发现这些模型普遍存在严重的性别失衡和文化误读问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究当代文本到图像AI模型在生成沙特职业图像时是否延续性别刻板印象和文化不准确性，评估这些模型对沙特劳动力市场性别动态和文化细微差别的反映程度。

Method: 使用中性提示词为56种沙特职业生成1,006张图像，由两名沙特标注员从五个维度评估：感知性别、服装外观、背景环境、活动互动和年龄，第三位资深研究员裁决分歧，共获得10,100个判断。

Result: 三种模型均显示严重性别失衡：ImageFX输出85%为男性，Grok 86.6%为男性，DALL-E V3 96%为男性，其中DALL-E V3性别刻板印象最严重。领导和技术角色性别失衡最明显，所有模型都频繁出现服装、环境和活动方面的文化不准确性。

Conclusion: 当前模型反映了训练数据中嵌入的社会偏见，仅有限地反映了沙特劳动力市场的性别动态和文化细微差别。需要更多样化的训练数据、更公平的算法和文化敏感的评估框架来确保公平和真实的视觉输出。

Abstract: This study investigates the extent to which contemporary Text-to-Image
artificial intelligence (AI) models perpetuate gender stereotypes and cultural
inaccuracies when generating depictions of professionals in Saudi Arabia. We
analyzed 1,006 images produced by ImageFX, DALL-E V3, and Grok for 56 diverse
Saudi professions using neutral prompts. Two trained Saudi annotators evaluated
each image on five dimensions: perceived gender, clothing and appearance,
background and setting, activities and interactions, and age. A third senior
researcher adjudicated whenever the two primary raters disagreed, yielding
10,100 individual judgements. The results reveal a strong gender imbalance,
with ImageFX outputs being 85\% male, Grok 86.6\% male, and DALL-E V3 96\%
male, indicating that DALL-E V3 exhibited the strongest overall gender
stereotyping. This imbalance was most evident in leadership and technical
roles. Moreover, cultural inaccuracies in clothing, settings, and depicted
activities were frequently observed across all three models.
Counter-stereotypical images often arise from cultural misinterpretations
rather than genuinely progressive portrayals. We conclude that current models
mirror societal biases embedded in their training data, generated by humans,
offering only a limited reflection of the Saudi labour market's gender dynamics
and cultural nuances. These findings underscore the urgent need for more
diverse training data, fairer algorithms, and culturally sensitive evaluation
frameworks to ensure equitable and authentic visual outputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常为每种不当内容类型训练单独的小型分类模型，需要大量人工标注数据且缺乏跨问题泛化能力。

Method: 引入三个预训练任务：Caption（增强对视频细节的感知）、VQA（加深对问题定义和标注指南的理解）、CoT（增强推理能力）。

Result: 实验结果显示该预训练方法显著提升了MLLM在零样本和监督微调设置下的性能。

Conclusion: 预训练模型对新兴、未见问题展现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Short video platforms are evolving rapidly, making the identification of
inappropriate content increasingly critical. Existing approaches typically
train separate and small classification models for each type of issue, which
requires extensive human-labeled data and lacks cross-issue generalization. We
propose a reasoning-enhanced multimodal large language model (MLLM) pretraining
paradigm for unified inappropriate content detection. To address the
distribution gap between short video content and the original pretraining data
of MLLMs, as well as the complex issue definitions, we introduce three targeted
pretraining tasks: (1) \textit{Caption}, to enhance the MLLM's perception of
video details; (2) \textit{Visual Question Answering (VQA)}, to deepen the
MLLM's understanding of issue definitions and annotation guidelines; (3)
\textit{Chain-of-Thought (CoT)}, to enhance the MLLM's reasoning capability.
Experimental results show that our pretraining approach significantly improves
the MLLM's performance in both zero-shot and supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
settings. In addition, our pretrained model demonstrates strong generalization
capabilities to emergent, previously unseen issues.

TL;DR: 将GUI定位重新定义为交互式搜索任务，通过光标移动来定位UI元素，而不是直接预测坐标，解决了VLMs在高分辨率GUI图像中坐标预测不准确的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GUI定位方法将问题视为坐标预测任务，但现有视觉语言模型在处理高分辨率复杂布局的GUI图像时，难以准确预测数值坐标。

Method: 提出GUI-Cursor模型，将GUI定位重构为交互式搜索任务：模型生成移动光标的动作，通过多步在线强化学习训练，使用基于轨迹的密集奖励函数。

Result: 基于Qwen2.5-VL-7B的GUI-Cursor在ScreenSpot-v2上准确率从88.8%提升到93.9%，在ScreenSpot-Pro上从26.8%提升到56.5%，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 交互式搜索方法能有效解决GUI定位问题，95%的实例在两步内解决，对困难案例能自适应增加步骤数，显著提升了定位精度。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding is commonly framed as a coordinate
prediction task -- given a natural language instruction, generate on-screen
coordinates for actions such as clicks and keystrokes. However, recent Vision
Language Models (VLMs) often fail to predict accurate numeric coordinates when
processing high-resolution GUI images with complex layouts. To address this
issue, we reframe GUI grounding as an \emph{interactive search task}, where the
VLM generates actions to move a cursor in the GUI to locate UI elements. At
each step, the model determines the target object, evaluates the spatial
relations between the cursor and the target, and moves the cursor closer to the
target conditioned on the movement history. In this interactive process, the
rendered cursor provides visual feedback to help the model align its
predictions with the corresponding on-screen locations. We train our GUI
grounding model, GUI-Cursor, using multi-step online reinforcement learning
with a dense trajectory-based reward function. Our experimental results show
that GUI-Cursor, based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, improves the GUI grounding accuracy
and achieves state-of-the-art results on ScreenSpot-v2 ($88.8\% \rightarrow
93.9\%$) and ScreenSpot-Pro ($26.8\% \rightarrow 56.5\%$). Moreover, we observe
that GUI-Cursor learns to solve the problem within two steps for 95\% of
instances and can adaptively conduct more steps on more difficult examples.

Motivation: 现有文本-视频检索系统存在两个问题：低质量文本-视频数据对影响检索效果但难以识别；余弦相似度无法解释排序结果，限制了可解释性。

Method: 在现有基准上增加视频标注以支持语义理解和减少数据偏差；设计检索CoT，包含成对比较步骤，生成详细推理和完整排序。

Result: X-CoT在实证中提高了检索性能，产生详细推理依据，并促进模型行为和数据质量分析。

Conclusion: X-CoT框架通过可解释的检索方法，不仅提升性能，还为模型评估和数据检查提供了新途径。

Abstract: Prevalent text-to-video retrieval systems mainly adopt embedding models for
feature extraction and compute cosine similarities for ranking. However, this
design presents two limitations. Low-quality text-video data pairs could
compromise the retrieval, yet are hard to identify and examine. Cosine
similarity alone provides no explanation for the ranking results, limiting the
interpretability. We ask that can we interpret the ranking results, so as to
assess the retrieval models and examine the text-video data? This work proposes
X-CoT, an explainable retrieval framework upon LLM CoT reasoning in place of
the embedding model-based similarity ranking. We first expand the existing
benchmarks with additional video annotations to support semantic understanding
and reduce data bias. We also devise a retrieval CoT consisting of pairwise
comparison steps, yielding detailed reasoning and complete ranking. X-CoT
empirically improves the retrieval performance and produces detailed
rationales. It also facilitates the model behavior and data quality analysis.

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过针对性的领域适应策略，成功解决了手术器械缺陷检测中的关键挑战，实现了可靠的细粒度缺陷检测。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of surgical instruments requires reliable detection of
visual defects. However, manual inspection is prone to error, and existing
automated defect detection methods, typically trained on natural/industrial
images, fail to transfer effectively to the surgical domain. We demonstrate
that simply applying or fine-tuning these approaches leads to issues: false
positive detections arising from textured backgrounds, poor sensitivity to
small, subtle defects, and inadequate capture of instrument-specific features
due to domain shift. To address these challenges, we propose a versatile method
that adapts unsupervised defect detection methods specifically for surgical
instruments. By integrating background masking, a patch-based analysis
strategy, and efficient domain adaptation, our method overcomes these
limitations, enabling the reliable detection of fine-grained defects in
surgical instrument imagery.

Motivation: 现有基于表示对齐的方法依赖大型预训练编码器，计算成本高昂。需要一种无需外部编码器的替代正则化方法。

Method: 提出LSEP（线性可分性）正则化，将线性探测直接融入网络学习动态，促进中间层表示的线性可分性，无需辅助编码器和表示对齐。

Result: 在SiT等流式transformer架构上显著提升了训练效率和生成质量，在256×256 ImageNet数据集上达到FID 1.46。

Conclusion: LSEP方法有效替代了基于对齐的方法，无需外部编码器，同时提高了训练效率和生成质量。

Abstract: Efficient training strategies for large-scale diffusion models have recently
emphasized the importance of improving discriminative feature representations
in these models. A central line of work in this direction is representation
alignment with features obtained from powerful external encoders, which
improves the representation quality as assessed through linear probing.
Alignment-based approaches show promise but depend on large pretrained
encoders, which are computationally expensive to obtain. In this work, we
propose an alternative regularization for training, based on promoting the
Linear SEParability (LSEP) of intermediate layer representations. LSEP
eliminates the need for an auxiliary encoder and representation alignment,
while incorporating linear probing directly into the network's learning
dynamics rather than treating it as a simple post-hoc evaluation tool. Our
results demonstrate substantial improvements in both training efficiency and
generation quality on flow-based transformer architectures such as SiTs,
achieving an FID of 1.46 on $256 \times 256$ ImageNet dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比学习方法在全局尺度图像地理定位中忽略了空间依赖性，导致无法有效处理假阴性（视觉和地理相似但被标记为负样本）和难负样本（视觉相似但地理距离远）的问题。

Method: 使用半变异函数这一地统计工具，将特征空间中的图像距离与其地理距离关联起来，捕捉空间相关性中的预期视觉内容，并以此识别难负样本和假阴性。

Result: 在OSV5M数据集上的实验表明，显式建模空间先验能提高图像地理定位性能，特别是在更细粒度级别上表现更好。

Conclusion: 通过整合空间正则化对比学习策略，能够有效利用空间依赖性来提升图像地理定位的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate and robust image-based geo-localization at a global scale is
challenging due to diverse environments, visually ambiguous scenes, and the
lack of distinctive landmarks in many regions. While contrastive learning
methods show promising performance by aligning features between street-view
images and corresponding locations, they neglect the underlying spatial
dependency in the geographic space. As a result, they fail to address the issue
of false negatives -- image pairs that are both visually and geographically
similar but labeled as negatives, and struggle to effectively distinguish hard
negatives, which are visually similar but geographically distant. To address
this issue, we propose a novel spatially regularized contrastive learning
strategy that integrates a semivariogram, which is a geostatistical tool for
modeling how spatial correlation changes with distance. We fit the
semivariogram by relating the distance of images in feature space to their
geographical distance, capturing the expected visual content in a spatial
correlation. With the fitted semivariogram, we define the expected visual
dissimilarity at a given spatial distance as reference to identify hard
negatives and false negatives. We integrate this strategy into GeoCLIP and
evaluate it on the OSV5M dataset, demonstrating that explicitly modeling
spatial priors improves image-based geo-localization performance, particularly
at finer granularity.

TL;DR: X-Streamer是一个端到端多模态人类世界建模框架，能够从单张肖像照片实现实时、开放式的视频通话，支持文本、语音和视频的无缝交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建能够在单一统一架构中实现文本、语音和视频无限交互的数字人类代理，将静态肖像转化为持久且智能的视听交互。

Method: 采用Thinker-Actor双变换器架构：Thinker模块基于预训练的大语言-语音模型处理流式用户输入；Actor模块使用分块自回归扩散模型，通过交叉注意力机制生成时间对齐的多模态响应。设计了跨块和块内注意力机制以及时间对齐的多模态位置嵌入。

Result: 在两个A100 GPU上实现实时运行，能够维持数小时一致的视频聊天体验，从任意肖像照片生成稳定的数字人类交互。

Conclusion: X-Streamer为交互式数字人类的统一世界建模开辟了新途径，实现了从静态肖像到智能视听交互的突破。

Abstract: We introduce X-Streamer, an end-to-end multimodal human world modeling
framework for building digital human agents capable of infinite interactions
across text, speech, and video within a single unified architecture. Starting
from a single portrait, X-Streamer enables real-time, open-ended video calls
driven by streaming multimodal inputs. At its core is a Thinker-Actor
dual-transformer architecture that unifies multimodal understanding and
generation, turning a static portrait into persistent and intelligent
audiovisual interactions. The Thinker module perceives and reasons over
streaming user inputs, while its hidden states are translated by the Actor into
synchronized multimodal streams in real time. Concretely, the Thinker leverages
a pretrained large language-speech model, while the Actor employs a chunk-wise
autoregressive diffusion model that cross-attends to the Thinker's hidden
states to produce time-aligned multimodal responses with interleaved discrete
text and audio tokens and continuous video latents. To ensure long-horizon
stability, we design inter- and intra-chunk attentions with time-aligned
multimodal positional embeddings for fine-grained cross-modality alignment and
context retention, further reinforced by chunk-wise diffusion forcing and
global identity referencing. X-Streamer runs in real time on two A100 GPUs,
sustaining hours-long consistent video chat experiences from arbitrary
portraits and paving the way toward unified world modeling of interactive
digital humans.

*Gabrijel Boduljak,Laurynas Karazija,Iro Laina,Christian Rupprecht,Andrea Vedaldi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种从单张图像预测物体运动轨迹的方法，通过生成密集轨迹网格而非像素来直接建模运动，在模拟数据和真实物理场景中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成器虽然被视为世界模型，但在从单张图像预测运动方面表现不佳，特别是在简单物理场景中。这源于生成像素而非直接建模运动的开销。

Method: 将运动预测建模为条件生成密集轨迹网格的任务，采用现代视频生成器架构但输出运动轨迹而非像素，直接捕捉场景范围内的动态和不确定性。

Result: 该方法在模拟数据上表现优异，在机器人等下游应用中有效，在真实世界直观物理数据集上显示出有前景的准确性，比先前的回归器和生成器产生更准确和多样化的预测。

Conclusion: 直接建模运动轨迹比生成像素更有效地解决单图像运动预测问题，为物理场景理解和机器人应用提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: We consider the problem of forecasting motion from a single image, i.e.,
predicting how objects in the world are likely to move, without the ability to
observe other parameters such as the object velocities or the forces applied to
them. We formulate this task as conditional generation of dense trajectory
grids with a model that closely follows the architecture of modern video
generators but outputs motion trajectories instead of pixels. This approach
captures scene-wide dynamics and uncertainty, yielding more accurate and
diverse predictions than prior regressors and generators. We extensively
evaluate our method on simulated data, demonstrate its effectiveness on
downstream applications such as robotics, and show promising accuracy on
real-world intuitive physics datasets. Although recent state-of-the-art video
generators are often regarded as world models, we show that they struggle with
forecasting motion from a single image, even in simple physical scenarios such
as falling blocks or mechanical object interactions, despite fine-tuning on
such data. We show that this limitation arises from the overhead of generating
pixels rather than directly modeling motion.

### [44] [Temporal vs. Spatial: Comparing DINOv3 and V-JEPA2 Feature Representations for Video Action Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21595)
*Sai Varun Kodathala,Rakesh Vunnam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 比较DINOv3和V-JEPA2两种自监督学习架构在视频动作识别中的表现，发现DINOv3在姿态识别上表现优异但运动依赖动作较差，V-JEPA2则提供更平衡的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解不同自监督学习架构在视频动作识别中的性能差异，为选择合适的特征提取方法提供实证指导。

Method: 在UCF Sports数据集上评估两种架构，通过分类准确率、聚类性能、类内一致性和类间区分度等多个维度分析特征质量。

Result: DINOv3在聚类性能（Silhouette得分0.31 vs 0.21）和姿态识别动作区分能力（6.16倍分离比）上更优，但V-JEPA2在所有动作类型上表现更稳定（方差0.094 vs 0.288）。

Conclusion: DINOv3的空间处理架构擅长静态姿态识别，V-JEPA2的时间建模提供跨动作类别的平衡表示质量，选择应基于任务需求和可靠性约束。

Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of two prominent
self-supervised learning architectures for video action recognition: DINOv3,
which processes frames independently through spatial feature extraction, and
V-JEPA2, which employs joint temporal modeling across video sequences. We
evaluate both approaches on the UCF Sports dataset, examining feature quality
through multiple dimensions including classification accuracy, clustering
performance, intra-class consistency, and inter-class discrimination. Our
analysis reveals fundamental architectural trade-offs: DINOv3 achieves superior
clustering performance (Silhouette score: 0.31 vs 0.21) and demonstrates
exceptional discrimination capability (6.16x separation ratio) particularly for
pose-identifiable actions, while V-JEPA2 exhibits consistent reliability across
all action types with significantly lower performance variance (0.094 vs
0.288). Through action-specific evaluation, we identify that DINOv3's spatial
processing architecture excels at static pose recognition but shows degraded
performance on motion-dependent actions, whereas V-JEPA2's temporal modeling
provides balanced representation quality across diverse action categories.
These findings contribute to the understanding of architectural design choices
in video analysis systems and provide empirical guidance for selecting
appropriate feature extraction methods based on task requirements and
reliability constraints.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLCE是一个多模态系统，通过双架构方法（CNN-LSTM和ViT）结合外部语义知识，从卫星和无人机图像生成详细的灾难破坏描述，显著优于现有视觉语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的人工灾害评估方法缓慢且危险，现有计算机视觉方法只能提供分类标签或分割掩码，无法提供全面的情境理解。

Method: 采用双架构方法：CNN-LSTM模型（基于ResNet50）处理卫星图像，Vision Transformer模型处理无人机图像，并利用ConceptNet和WordNet的外部语义知识扩展词汇覆盖范围。

Result: VLCE在InfoMetIC指标上达到最高95.33%，同时保持有竞争力的语义对齐，显著优于LLaVA和QwenVL等基线模型。

Conclusion: 双架构系统通过自动化生成信息密集的描述，在改善灾害破坏评估方面展现出巨大潜力。

Abstract: Immediate damage assessment is essential after natural catastrophes; yet,
conventional hand evaluation techniques are sluggish and perilous. Although
satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photos offer extensive perspectives
of impacted regions, current computer vision methodologies generally yield just
classification labels or segmentation masks, so constraining their capacity to
deliver a thorough situational comprehension. We introduce the Vision Language
Caption Enhancer (VLCE), a multimodal system designed to produce comprehensive,
contextually-informed explanations of disaster imagery. VLCE employs a
dual-architecture approach: a CNN-LSTM model with a ResNet50 backbone
pretrained on EuroSat satellite imagery for the xBD dataset, and a Vision
Transformer (ViT) model pretrained on UAV pictures for the RescueNet dataset.
Both systems utilize external semantic knowledge from ConceptNet and WordNet to
expand vocabulary coverage and improve description accuracy. We assess VLCE in
comparison to leading vision-language models (LLaVA and QwenVL) utilizing
CLIPScore for semantic alignment and InfoMetIC for caption informativeness.
Experimental findings indicate that VLCE markedly surpasses baseline models,
attaining a maximum of 95.33% on InfoMetIC while preserving competitive
semantic alignment. Our dual-architecture system demonstrates significant
potential for improving disaster damage assessment by automating the production
of actionable, information-dense descriptions from satellite and drone photos.

*Jialin Wu,Shreya Saha,Yiqing Bo,Meenakshi Khosla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究使用多种表征相似性度量方法分析不同视觉模型家族的表征特性，发现几何结构和单元调谐能区分模型家族，而线性可解码信息则更普遍共享。通过相似性网络融合方法整合多维度信息，实现了更好的家族分离效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同视觉模型在架构和训练范式上差异很大，但缺乏系统方法来识别哪些表征特性是跨家族共享的，哪些反映了独特的计算策略。

Method: 使用多种表征相似性度量方法（RSA、Soft Matching、Linear Predictivity等）评估模型表征，并采用相似性网络融合技术整合不同维度的相似性信息。

Result: 几何结构和单元调谐相关的度量能有效区分模型家族，而线性可解码信息显示较弱的分隔。融合后的相似性矩阵实现了更好的家族分离，聚类分析揭示了监督ResNets和ViTs形成不同簇，而所有自监督模型跨越架构边界聚集在一起。

Conclusion: 该生物学启发框架为视觉模型提供了原则性分类方法，表明新兴计算策略（由架构和训练目标共同塑造）定义了超越表面设计类别的表征结构。

Abstract: Large vision models differ widely in architecture and training paradigm, yet
we lack principled methods to determine which aspects of their representations
are shared across families and which reflect distinctive computational
strategies. We leverage a suite of representational similarity metrics, each
capturing a different facet-geometry, unit tuning, or linear decodability-and
assess family separability using multiple complementary measures. Metrics
preserving geometry or tuning (e.g., RSA, Soft Matching) yield strong family
discrimination, whereas flexible mappings such as Linear Predictivity show
weaker separation. These findings indicate that geometry and tuning carry
family-specific signatures, while linearly decodable information is more
broadly shared. To integrate these complementary facets, we adapt Similarity
Network Fusion (SNF), a method inspired by multi-omics integration. SNF
achieves substantially sharper family separation than any individual metric and
produces robust composite signatures. Clustering of the fused similarity matrix
recovers both expected and surprising patterns: supervised ResNets and ViTs
form distinct clusters, yet all self-supervised models group together across
architectural boundaries. Hybrid architectures (ConvNeXt, Swin) cluster with
masked autoencoders, suggesting convergence between architectural modernization
and reconstruction-based training. This biology-inspired framework provides a
principled typology of vision models, showing that emergent computational
strategies-shaped jointly by architecture and training objective-define
representational structure beyond surface design categories.

*Yixiang Dai,Fan Jiang,Chiyu Wang,Mu Xu,Yonggang Qi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FantasyWorld是一个几何增强框架，通过向冻结的视频基础模型添加可训练的几何分支，在单次前向传播中联合建模视频潜在空间和隐式3D场，实现3D感知的视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频基础模型缺乏明确的3D基础能力，限制了空间一致性和下游3D推理任务的实用性。需要将视频想象力与3D感知能力相结合。

Method: 引入跨分支监督机制，几何线索指导视频生成，视频先验正则化3D预测，形成统一主干和跨分支信息交换的框架。

Result: 在多个实验中，FantasyWorld在多视角一致性和风格一致性方面优于现有几何一致基线，有效桥接了视频想象力与3D感知。

Conclusion: 该框架通过统一主干和跨分支信息交换实现了3D感知视频表示，几何分支的潜在表示可作为下游3D任务的通用表示，无需逐场景优化或微调。

Abstract: High-quality 3D world models are pivotal for embodied intelligence and
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), underpinning applications such as AR/VR
content creation and robotic navigation. Despite the established strong
imaginative priors, current video foundation models lack explicit 3D grounding
capabilities, thus being limited in both spatial consistency and their utility
for downstream 3D reasoning tasks. In this work, we present FantasyWorld, a
geometry-enhanced framework that augments frozen video foundation models with a
trainable geometric branch, enabling joint modeling of video latents and an
implicit 3D field in a single forward pass. Our approach introduces
cross-branch supervision, where geometry cues guide video generation and video
priors regularize 3D prediction, thus yielding consistent and generalizable
3D-aware video representations. Notably, the resulting latents from the
geometric branch can potentially serve as versatile representations for
downstream 3D tasks such as novel view synthesis and navigation, without
requiring per-scene optimization or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show
that FantasyWorld effectively bridges video imagination and 3D perception,
outperforming recent geometry-consistent baselines in multi-view coherence and
style consistency. Ablation studies further confirm that these gains stem from
the unified backbone and cross-branch information exchange.

TL;DR: MORPH是一个形状无关的自回归基础模型，用于处理偏微分方程，能够处理1D-3D的异构时空数据集，支持多场混合标量和矢量分量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决科学机器学习中处理异构和多模态观测数据的挑战，提供可扩展且数据高效的学习方法。

Method: 基于卷积视觉变换器架构，结合组件卷积、场间交叉注意力和轴向注意力，预训练多种模型变体，并使用LoRA进行参数高效微调。

Result: 在零样本和全样本泛化中优于从头训练的模型，匹配或超越强基线和最新SOTA模型。

Conclusion: MORPH为科学观测的异构和多模态学习提供了灵活强大的骨干网络，推动了可扩展和数据高效的科学机器学习发展。

Abstract: We introduce MORPH, a shape-agnostic, autoregressive foundation model for
partial differential equations (PDEs). MORPH is built on a convolutional vision
transformer backbone that seamlessly handles heterogeneous spatiotemporal
datasets of varying data dimensionality (1D--3D) at different resolutions,
multiple fields with mixed scalar and vector components. The architecture
combines (i) component-wise convolution, which jointly processes scalar and
vector channels to capture local interactions, (ii) inter-field
cross-attention, which models and selectively propagates information between
different physical fields, (iii) axial attentions, which factorizes full
spatiotemporal self-attention along individual spatial and temporal axes to
reduce computational burden while retaining expressivity. We pretrain multiple
model variants on a diverse collection of heterogeneous PDE datasets and
evaluate transfer to a range of downstream prediction tasks. Using both
full-model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient low-rank adapters (LoRA), MORPH
outperforms models trained from scratch in both zero-shot and full-shot
generalization. Across extensive evaluations, MORPH matches or surpasses strong
baselines and recent state-of-the-art models. Collectively, these capabilities
present a flexible and powerful backbone for learning from heterogeneous and
multimodal nature of scientific observations, charting a path toward scalable
and data-efficient scientific machine learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决红外成像在低光照和恶劣天气条件下目标检测面临的类别不平衡、热噪声和计算资源限制等问题，提升实际应用中的模型性能。

Method: 基于YOLOv8基线，用MobileNetV4替换CSPDarknet骨干网络降低计算开销，并引入SlideLoss损失函数动态关注欠表示和遮挡样本。

Result: MS-YOLO在FLIR ADAS V2基准测试中达到竞争性的mAP和优越的精度，仅需6.7 GFLOPs计算量，比基线减少1.5%计算开销。

Conclusion: MS-YOLO有效解决了保持高检测质量同时最小化计算成本的双重挑战，适合城市环境中的实时边缘部署。

Abstract: Infrared imaging has emerged as a robust solution for urban object detection
under low-light and adverse weather conditions, offering significant advantages
over traditional visible-light cameras. However, challenges such as class
imbalance, thermal noise, and computational constraints can significantly
hinder model performance in practical settings. To address these issues, we
evaluate multiple YOLO variants on the FLIR ADAS V2 dataset, ultimately
selecting YOLOv8 as our baseline due to its balanced accuracy and efficiency.
Building on this foundation, we present \texttt{MS-YOLO} (\textbf{M}obileNetv4
and \textbf{S}lideLoss based on YOLO), which replaces YOLOv8's CSPDarknet
backbone with the more efficient MobileNetV4, reducing computational overhead
by \textbf{1.5%} while sustaining high accuracy. In addition, we introduce
\emph{SlideLoss}, a novel loss function that dynamically emphasizes
under-represented and occluded samples, boosting precision without sacrificing
recall. Experiments on the FLIR ADAS V2 benchmark show that \texttt{MS-YOLO}
attains competitive mAP and superior precision while operating at only
\textbf{6.7 GFLOPs}. These results demonstrate that \texttt{MS-YOLO}
effectively addresses the dual challenge of maintaining high detection quality
while minimizing computational costs, making it well-suited for real-time edge
deployment in urban environments.

*Xu Yang,Gady Agam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Motion-Aware Transformer (MATR)用于多目标跟踪，通过显式预测目标运动来提前更新跟踪查询，减少查询冲突，在DanceTrack、SportsMOT和BDD100k数据集上取得SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于DETR的多目标跟踪方法在单个Transformer解码器层中联合处理检测和跟踪查询，导致查询冲突和关联精度下降。

Method: 引入Motion-Aware Transformer (MATR)，显式预测目标跨帧运动来提前更新跟踪查询，减少查询碰撞，实现更一致的训练。

Result: 在DanceTrack上HOTA提升超过9点，达到71.3；SportsMOT上72.2 HOTA；BDD100k上54.7 mTETA和41.6 mHOTA，均达到SOTA水平。

Conclusion: 在端到端Transformer中显式建模运动是推进多目标跟踪的简单而高效的方法。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in videos remains challenging due to complex
object motions and crowded scenes. Recent DETR-based frameworks offer
end-to-end solutions but typically process detection and tracking queries
jointly within a single Transformer Decoder layer, leading to conflicts and
degraded association accuracy. We introduce the Motion-Aware Transformer
(MATR), which explicitly predicts object movements across frames to update
track queries in advance. By reducing query collisions, MATR enables more
consistent training and improves both detection and association. Extensive
experiments on DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BDD100k show that MATR delivers
significant gains across standard metrics. On DanceTrack, MATR improves HOTA by
more than 9 points over MOTR without additional data and reaches a new
state-of-the-art score of 71.3 with supplementary data. MATR also achieves
state-of-the-art results on SportsMOT (72.2 HOTA) and BDD100k (54.7 mTETA, 41.6
mHOTA) without relying on external datasets. These results demonstrate that
explicitly modeling motion within end-to-end Transformers offers a simple yet
highly effective approach to advancing multi-object tracking.

Motivation: 解决野外拍摄视频中常见的雨纹、模糊和噪声问题，以及相机姿态微小变化导致的跨帧不匹配和时间伪影。现有方法依赖光流或启发式对齐，计算成本高且鲁棒性差。

Method: 提出两个互补组件：1) 旋转有界的李相对偏置，通过紧凑预测模块预测每帧的平面内角度，实现几何一致对齐；2) 微分群位移，计算相邻帧间角度差异来估计速度，结合时间衰减和注意力掩码关注帧间关系。

Result: 在公开基准测试上的广泛实验结果证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 李群为视频建模中的空间和时间一致性提供了原则性表示方法，DeLiVR通过注入李群微分偏置实现了高效且鲁棒的视频去雨。

Abstract: Videos captured in the wild often suffer from rain streaks, blur, and noise.
In addition, even slight changes in camera pose can amplify cross-frame
mismatches and temporal artifacts. Existing methods rely on optical flow or
heuristic alignment, which are computationally expensive and less robust. To
address these challenges, Lie groups provide a principled way to represent
continuous geometric transformations, making them well-suited for enforcing
spatial and temporal consistency in video modeling. Building on this insight,
we propose DeLiVR, an efficient video deraining method that injects
spatiotemporal Lie-group differential biases directly into attention scores of
the network. Specifically, the method introduces two complementary components.
First, a rotation-bounded Lie relative bias predicts the in-plane angle of each
frame using a compact prediction module, where normalized coordinates are
rotated and compared with base coordinates to achieve geometry-consistent
alignment before feature aggregation. Second, a differential group displacement
computes angular differences between adjacent frames to estimate a velocity.
This bias computation combines temporal decay and attention masks to focus on
inter-frame relationships while precisely matching the direction of rain
streaks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method on publicly available benchmarks.

Motivation: 受到自然图像领域基础模型巨大进展的启发，希望将这种技术应用于SAR领域，利用基础模型的优势：只需少量标注数据即可适应下游任务、对分布偏移更鲁棒、特征可迁移性强。

Method: 首先测试现有最强视觉基础模型(DINOv2、DINOv3、PE-Core)在SAR任务中的表现，然后使用SAR数据对公开SSL模型进行自监督微调，训练多个AFRL-DINOv2模型。

Result: AFRL-DINOv2模型显著优于当前最佳SAR领域模型SARATR-X，建立了SAR基础模型的新最先进水平。实验分析了不同骨干网络和下游任务适应方法的性能权衡。

Conclusion: 自监督微调公开SSL模型是SAR基础模型发展的可行路径，尽管取得了积极成果，但SAR基础模型建设仍有很长的路要走。

Abstract: In this work we investigate the viability of foundational AI/ML models for
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object recognition tasks. We are inspired by the
tremendous progress being made in the wider community, particularly in the
natural image domain where frontier labs are training huge models on web-scale
datasets with unprecedented computing budgets. It has become clear that these
models, often trained with Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), will transform how
we develop AI/ML solutions for object recognition tasks - they can be adapted
downstream with very limited labeled data, they are more robust to many forms
of distribution shift, and their features are highly transferable
out-of-the-box. For these reasons and more, we are motivated to apply this
technology to the SAR domain. In our experiments we first run tests with
today's most powerful visual foundational models, including DINOv2, DINOv3 and
PE-Core and observe their shortcomings at extracting semantically-interesting
discriminative SAR target features when used off-the-shelf. We then show that
Self-Supervised finetuning of publicly available SSL models with SAR data is a
viable path forward by training several AFRL-DINOv2s and setting a new
state-of-the-art for SAR foundation models, significantly outperforming today's
best SAR-domain model SARATR-X. Our experiments further analyze the performance
trade-off of using different backbones with different downstream
task-adaptation recipes, and we monitor each model's ability to overcome
challenges within the downstream environments (e.g., extended operating
conditions and low amounts of labeled data). We hope this work will inform and
inspire future SAR foundation model builders, because despite our positive
results, we still have a long way to go.

Abstract: Lightweight retinal vessel segmentation is important for the early diagnosis
of vision-threatening and systemic diseases, especially in a real-world
clinical environment with limited computational resources. Although
segmentation methods based on deep learning are improving, existing models are
still facing challenges of small vessel segmentation and high computational
costs. To address these challenges, we proposed a new vascular segmentation
network, LFA-Net, which incorporates a newly designed attention module,
LiteFusion-Attention. This attention module incorporates residual learning
connections, Vision Mamba-inspired dynamics, and modulation-based attention,
enabling the model to capture local and global context efficiently and in a
lightweight manner. LFA-Net offers high performance with 0.11 million
parameters, 0.42 MB memory size, and 4.46 GFLOPs, which make it ideal for
resource-constrained environments. We validated our proposed model on DRIVE,
STARE, and CHASE_DB with outstanding performance in terms of dice scores of
83.28, 87.44, and 84.50% and Jaccard indices of 72.85, 79.31, and 74.70%,

Motivation: 现有基础模型（特别是transformer解码器）存在高计算开销和缺乏可解释性的问题，限制了在资源受限场景中的部署。

Method: 采用可训练的硬特征选择器进行稀疏操作，并将特征选择集成到早期退出机制中，使用贝叶斯优化确定最佳退出阈值。

Result: 与ViNT相比，DynaNav实现了FLOPs减少2.26倍，推理时间降低42.3%，内存使用降低32.8%，同时在四个公共数据集上提高了导航性能。

Conclusion: DynaNav通过动态特征和层选择有效解决了视觉导航中的计算效率问题，为资源受限环境提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual navigation is essential for robotics and embodied AI. However,
existing foundation models, particularly those with transformer decoders,
suffer from high computational overhead and lack interpretability, limiting
their deployment in resource-tight scenarios. To address this, we propose
DynaNav, a Dynamic Visual Navigation framework that adapts feature and layer
selection based on scene complexity. It employs a trainable hard feature
selector for sparse operations, enhancing efficiency and interpretability.
Additionally, we integrate feature selection into an early-exit mechanism, with
Bayesian Optimization determining optimal exit thresholds to reduce
computational cost. Extensive experiments in real-world-based datasets and
simulated environments demonstrate the effectiveness of DynaNav. Compared to
ViNT, DynaNav achieves a 2.26x reduction in FLOPs, 42.3% lower inference time,
and 32.8% lower memory usage, while improving navigation performance across
four public datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了一种融合视觉场景上下文和标签引导语义信息的新框架，用于改进群体级情感识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法低估了视觉场景上下文信息在建模个体关系中的重要性，并且忽视了情感标签语义信息对情感完整理解的关键作用。

Method: 包含视觉上下文编码模块（利用多尺度场景信息编码个体关系）和情感语义编码模块（使用群体级情感标签提示大语言模型生成精细情感词典，并通过结构化情感树生成全面语义表示），最后通过相似性感知交互对齐和整合视觉与语义信息。

Result: 在三个广泛采用的GER数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比最先进方法实现了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的融合视觉场景上下文和标签引导语义信息的框架能够有效提升群体级情感识别性能。

Abstract: Group-level emotion recognition (GER) aims to identify holistic emotions
within a scene involving multiple individuals. Current existed methods
underestimate the importance of visual scene contextual information in modeling
individual relationships. Furthermore, they overlook the crucial role of
semantic information from emotional labels for complete understanding of
emotions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that
incorporates visual scene context and label-guided semantic information to
improve GER performance. It involves the visual context encoding module that
leverages multi-scale scene information to diversely encode individual
relationships. Complementarily, the emotion semantic encoding module utilizes
group-level emotion labels to prompt a large language model to generate nuanced
emotion lexicons. These lexicons, in conjunction with the emotion labels, are
then subsequently refined into comprehensive semantic representations through
the utilization of a structured emotion tree. Finally, similarity-aware
interaction is proposed to align and integrate visual and semantic information,
thereby generating enhanced group-level emotion representations and
subsequently improving the performance of GER. Experiments on three widely
adopted GER datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: KG-SAM是一个知识引导的医学图像分割框架，通过整合解剖学先验知识、边界优化和不确定性估计，解决了SAM模型在医学图像应用中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM模型在医学图像分割中面临边界模糊、解剖关系建模不足和缺乏不确定性量化等挑战，需要专门针对医学领域进行改进。

Method: 引入医学知识图谱编码解剖关系，使用基于能量的条件随机场确保解剖一致性预测，并开发不确定性感知融合模块提高临床可靠性。

Result: 在前列腺分割中达到82.69%的平均Dice分数，在腹部MRI分割中达到78.05%，在CT分割中达到79.68%，表现显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: KG-SAM是一个稳健且可推广的框架，能够有效推进医学图像分割技术的发展，特别适用于高风险临床场景。

Abstract: While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has achieved remarkable success in
image segmentation, its direct application to medical imaging remains hindered
by fundamental challenges, including ambiguous boundaries, insufficient
modeling of anatomical relationships, and the absence of uncertainty
quantification. To address these limitations, we introduce KG-SAM, a
knowledge-guided framework that synergistically integrates anatomical priors
with boundary refinement and uncertainty estimation. Specifically, KG-SAM
incorporates (i) a medical knowledge graph to encode fine-grained anatomical
relationships, (ii) an energy-based Conditional Random Field (CRF) to enforce
anatomically consistent predictions, and (iii) an uncertainty-aware fusion
module to enhance reliability in high-stakes clinical scenarios. Extensive
experiments across multi-center medical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach: KG-SAM achieves an average Dice score of 82.69% on prostate
segmentation and delivers substantial gains in abdominal segmentation, reaching
78.05% on MRI and 79.68% on CT. These results establish KG-SAM as a robust and
generalizable framework for advancing medical image segmentation.

*Lan Chen,Yuchao Gu,Qi Mao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniVid框架通过微调预训练视频生成模型，将多种视觉任务统一表示为视觉句子序列，无需任务特定修改即可处理跨模态和跨源任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉模型需要跨模态和源的任务特定预训练，成本高且难以扩展到未见任务。预训练视频生成模型已具备时序依赖能力，能否直接适应多种视觉任务？

Method: 提出UniVid框架，微调视频扩散transformer，将任务表示为视觉句子序列，上下文序列定义任务和输出模态。支持跨模态推理和跨源任务。

Result: 仅使用自然视频数据训练，UniVid在跨模态和跨源任务上表现良好。理解和生成任务可通过简单反转视觉句子顺序切换。

Conclusion: 预训练视频生成模型有潜力作为可扩展的统一视觉建模基础，无需多源预训练即可泛化到多种任务。

Abstract: Large language models, trained on extensive corpora, successfully unify
diverse linguistic tasks within a single generative framework. Inspired by
this, recent works like Large Vision Model (LVM) extend this paradigm to vision
by organizing tasks into sequential visual sentences, where visual prompts
serve as the context to guide outputs. However, such modeling requires
task-specific pre-training across modalities and sources, which is costly and
limits scalability to unseen tasks. Given that pre-trained video generation
models inherently capture temporal sequence dependencies, we explore a more
unified and scalable alternative: can a pre-trained video generation model
adapt to diverse image and video tasks? To answer this, we propose UniVid, a
framework that fine-tunes a video diffusion transformer to handle various
vision tasks without task-specific modifications. Tasks are represented as
visual sentences, where the context sequence defines both the task and the
expected output modality. We evaluate the generalization of UniVid from two
perspectives: (1) cross-modal inference with contexts composed of both images
and videos, extending beyond LVM's uni-modal setting; (2) cross-source tasks
from natural to annotated data, without multi-source pre-training. Despite
being trained solely on natural video data, UniVid generalizes well in both
settings. Notably, understanding and generation tasks can easily switch by
simply reversing the visual sentence order in this paradigm. These findings
highlight the potential of pre-trained video generation models to serve as a
scalable and unified foundation for vision modeling. Our code will be released
at https://github.com/CUC-MIPG/UniVid.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种保持空间完整性的token合并方法，能够与空间架构无缝兼容，在保持空间结构的同时实现token减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代ViT骨干网络采用空间架构设计，但现有token减少方法无法保持这些架构所依赖的空间结构。

Method: 采用2D减少策略强制执行结构化token布局、空间感知合并算法保持相对位置关系、以及最大幅度维度token表示保留显著特征。

Result: 在SAM-H上实现1.25倍加速且仅0.7% mIOU下降，在DeiT-B上实现1.15倍加速且无top-1准确率下降。

Conclusion: 该方法在空间和非空间架构上均实现最先进性能，支持即插即用和微调两种使用方式。

Abstract: Many modern ViT backbones adopt spatial architectural designs, such as window
attention, decomposed relative positional embeddings in SAM, and RoPE in
DINOv3. Such architectures impose new challenges on token reduction, as the
vast majority of existing methods fail to preserve the spatial structure these
architectures depend on. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective
token merging method that maintains spatial integrity, enabling seamless
compatibility with spatial architectures. We reconcile two seemingly
conflicting requirements: (i)exploiting the uneven information distribution
across the spatial layout while (ii)preserving the spatial structure
post-merging. Our approach employs (i)a 2D reduction strategy to enforce
structured token layouts, (ii)a spatial-aware merging algorithm that maintains
relative token positions, and (iii)a novel max-magnitude-per-dimension token
representation that preserves salient features. Our method demonstrates strong
performance both off-the-shelf and with fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art
results on spatial and non-spatial architectures across various vision tasks.
Specifically, we achieve 1.25x speedup on SAM-H with only 0.7% mIOU drop
evaluated on COCO off-the-shelf, and 1.15x speedup on DeiT-B with no top-1
accuracy drop on ImageNet within just one epoch of fine-tuning.

Conclusion: 该工作为任务导向的桌面场景生成提供了有效解决方案，通过空间推理链和强化学习优化，成功弥合了任务指令与场景布局之间的差距。

Abstract: The ability of robots to interpret human instructions and execute
manipulation tasks necessitates the availability of task-relevant tabletop
scenes for training. However, traditional methods for creating these scenes
rely on time-consuming manual layout design or purely randomized layouts, which
are limited in terms of plausibility or alignment with the tasks. In this
paper, we formulate a novel task, namely task-oriented tabletop scene
generation, which poses significant challenges due to the substantial gap
between high-level task instructions and the tabletop scenes. To support
research on such a challenging task, we introduce MesaTask-10K, a large-scale
dataset comprising approximately 10,700 synthetic tabletop scenes with manually
crafted layouts that ensure realistic layouts and intricate inter-object
relations. To bridge the gap between tasks and scenes, we propose a Spatial
Reasoning Chain that decomposes the generation process into object inference,
spatial interrelation reasoning, and scene graph construction for the final 3D
layout. We present MesaTask, an LLM-based framework that utilizes this
reasoning chain and is further enhanced with DPO algorithms to generate
physically plausible tabletop scenes that align well with given task
descriptions. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of
MesaTask compared to baselines in generating task-conforming tabletop scenes
with realistic layouts. Project page is at https://mesatask.github.io/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型视觉语言模型在多模态推理方面表现出色，但在多模态深度伪造检测中存在挑战：难以捕捉细微伪造线索、解决跨模态不一致性以及执行任务对齐检索。

Method: GASP-ICL框架包含：1) 使用MDD适应的特征提取器检索对齐的图像-文本对构建候选集；2) 设计图结构泰勒自适应评分器(GSTAS)捕获跨样本关系并传播查询对齐信号，生成判别性示例；3) 精确选择语义对齐的任务相关演示。

Result: 在四种伪造类型上的实验表明，GASP-ICL超越了强基线方法，在不进行LVLM微调的情况下实现了性能提升。

Conclusion: GASP-ICL通过保持语义相关性同时注入任务感知知识，有效增强了大型视觉语言模型在多模态深度伪造检测中的鲁棒性，为无需训练的多模态伪造检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal deepfake detection (MDD) aims to uncover manipulations across
visual, textual, and auditory modalities, thereby reinforcing the reliability
of modern information systems. Although large vision-language models (LVLMs)
exhibit strong multimodal reasoning, their effectiveness in MDD is limited by
challenges in capturing subtle forgery cues, resolving cross-modal
inconsistencies, and performing task-aligned retrieval. To this end, we propose
Guided Adaptive Scorer and Propagation In-Context Learning (GASP-ICL), a
training-free framework for MDD. GASP-ICL employs a pipeline to preserve
semantic relevance while injecting task-aware knowledge into LVLMs. We leverage
an MDD-adapted feature extractor to retrieve aligned image-text pairs and build
a candidate set. We further design the Graph-Structured Taylor Adaptive Scorer
(GSTAS) to capture cross-sample relations and propagate query-aligned signals,
producing discriminative exemplars. This enables precise selection of
semantically aligned, task-relevant demonstrations, enhancing LVLMs for robust
MDD. Experiments on four forgery types show that GASP-ICL surpasses strong
baselines, delivering gains without LVLM fine-tuning.

Conclusion: ProDA框架能够有效解耦多动作场景中的指定动作，提升动作识别性能

Abstract: Action recognition is a fundamental task in video understanding. Existing
methods typically extract unified features to process all actions in one video,
which makes it challenging to model the interactions between different objects
in multi-action scenarios. To alleviate this issue, we explore disentangling
any specified actions from complex scenes as an effective solution. In this
paper, we propose Prompt-guided Disentangled Representation for Action
Recognition (ProDA), a novel framework that disentangles any specified actions
from a multi-action scene. ProDA leverages Spatio-temporal Scene Graphs (SSGs)
and introduces Dynamic Prompt Module (DPM) to guide a Graph Parsing Neural
Network (GPNN) in generating action-specific representations. Furthermore, we
design a video-adapted GPNN that aggregates information using dynamic weights.
Experiments in video action recognition demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach when compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Our code can be found

Abstract: The rise in harmful online content not only distorts public discourse but
also poses significant challenges to maintaining a healthy digital environment.
In response to this, we introduce a multimodal dataset uniquely crafted for
identifying hate in digital content. Central to our methodology is the
innovative application of watermarked, stability-enhanced, stable diffusion
techniques combined with the Digital Attention Analysis Module (DAAM). This
combination is instrumental in pinpointing the hateful elements within images,
thereby generating detailed hate attention maps, which are used to blur these
regions from the image, thereby removing the hateful sections of the image. We
release this data set as a part of the dehate shared task. This paper also
describes the details of the shared task. Furthermore, we present DeHater, a
vision-language model designed for multimodal dehatification tasks. Our
approach sets a new standard in AI-driven image hate detection given textual

Motivation: 当前大型视觉语言模型在多图像推理方面存在两个关键挑战：缺乏跨图像推理能力和不足的跨图像参考奖励建模。

Method: 提出两阶段训练范式：结合标注轨迹的监督微调和图像感知强化学习优化；创新性地构建了整合对象级和图像级标注信息的轨迹数据生成方法；设计了具有对象和图像双重奖励函数的图像感知RL策略。

Result: 在多图像定位基准测试中达到最先进性能，跨图像推理任务达到64.82%，比之前最佳方法提升1%。

Conclusion: MIRG-RL框架有效解决了多图像推理和定位问题，通过创新的训练方法和奖励设计显著提升了跨图像推理能力。

Abstract: Multi-image reasoning and grounding require understanding complex cross-image
relationships at both object levels and image levels. Current Large Visual
Language Models (LVLMs) face two critical challenges: the lack of cross-image
reasoning capabilities and insufficient cross-image reference reward modeling.
To address these issues, we propose a unified framework - Multi-Image Reasoning
and Grounding with Reinforcement Learning (MIRG-RL). Specifically, our
two-stage training paradigm combines supervised fine-tuning with annotated
trajectories and image-aware reinforcement learning optimization, progressively
developing multi-image reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we innovatively
propose a method for constructing the trajectory data, which integrates
object-level and image-level annotation information, and use this method to
generate a lightweight reasoning-enhanced dataset. To effectively resolve
cross-image ambiguities, we design an image-aware RL policy with dual reward
functions for objects and images. Experiments demonstrate that MIRG-RL achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multi-image grounding benchmarks,
attaining 64.82% on cross-image reasoning tasks - exceeding the previous best
method by 1%. The code and dataset have been released at

Motivation: 解决现有视频生成方法在长时程生成中的问题：扩散方法存在时间不一致和视觉漂移，自回归方法牺牲视觉细节。

Method: 提出动作引导的可变长度分块机制，将视频按机器人动作语义分割；引入上下文感知专家混合框架，为每个分块自适应激活专家模型。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在扩展推演中实现了稳定一致的长时程生成。

Conclusion: LongScape框架成功解决了长时程视频生成的稳定性问题，为高质量具身操作数据生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Video-based world models hold significant potential for generating
high-quality embodied manipulation data. However, current video generation
methods struggle to achieve stable long-horizon generation: classical
diffusion-based approaches often suffer from temporal inconsistency and visual
drift over multiple rollouts, while autoregressive methods tend to compromise
on visual detail. To solve this, we introduce LongScape, a hybrid framework
that adaptively combines intra-chunk diffusion denoising with inter-chunk
autoregressive causal generation. Our core innovation is an action-guided,
variable-length chunking mechanism that partitions video based on the semantic
context of robotic actions. This ensures each chunk represents a complete,
coherent action, enabling the model to flexibly generate diverse dynamics. We
further introduce a Context-aware Mixture-of-Experts (CMoE) framework that
adaptively activates specialized experts for each chunk during generation,
guaranteeing high visual quality and seamless chunk transitions. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves stable and consistent
long-horizon generation over extended rollouts. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: JanusVLN提出了一种新的视觉语言导航框架，采用双隐式神经记忆系统来分别建模空间几何和视觉语义记忆，解决了传统方法中空间信息丢失、计算冗余和内存膨胀的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLN方法依赖显式语义记忆（如文本认知地图或历史视觉帧），导致空间信息丢失、计算冗余和内存膨胀，阻碍了高效导航。受人类导航中隐式场景表示的启发，提出双隐式神经记忆框架。

Method: 扩展MLLM以融入空间几何编码器的3D先验知识，增强仅基于RGB输入的空间推理能力。构建空间几何和视觉语义编码器的历史键值缓存作为双隐式记忆，仅保留初始和滑动窗口中的令牌KVs，避免冗余计算，实现高效增量更新。

Result: 在广泛实验中，JanusVLN超越了20多种近期方法，达到SOTA性能。相比使用多种数据类型输入的方法，成功率提升10.5-35.5；相比使用更多RGB训练数据的方法，成功率提升3.6-10.8。

Conclusion: 提出的双隐式神经记忆作为一种新范式，为未来VLN研究探索了有前景的新方向。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation requires an embodied agent to navigate through
unseen environments, guided by natural language instructions and a continuous
video stream. Recent advances in VLN have been driven by the powerful semantic
understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models. However, these methods
typically rely on explicit semantic memory, such as building textual cognitive
maps or storing historical visual frames. This type of method suffers from
spatial information loss, computational redundancy, and memory bloat, which
impede efficient navigation. Inspired by the implicit scene representation in
human navigation, analogous to the left brain's semantic understanding and the
right brain's spatial cognition, we propose JanusVLN, a novel VLN framework
featuring a dual implicit neural memory that models spatial-geometric and
visual-semantic memory as separate, compact, and fixed-size neural
representations. This framework first extends the MLLM to incorporate 3D prior
knowledge from the spatial-geometric encoder, thereby enhancing the spatial
reasoning capabilities of models based solely on RGB input. Then, the
historical key-value caches from the spatial-geometric and visual-semantic
encoders are constructed into a dual implicit memory. By retaining only the KVs
of tokens in the initial and sliding window, redundant computation is avoided,
enabling efficient incremental updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
JanusVLN outperforms over 20 recent methods to achieve SOTA performance. For
example, the success rate improves by 10.5-35.5 compared to methods using
multiple data types as input and by 3.6-10.8 compared to methods using more RGB
training data. This indicates that the proposed dual implicit neural memory, as
a novel paradigm, explores promising new directions for future VLN research.

Abstract: Embodied action planning is a core challenge in robotics, requiring models to
generate precise actions from visual observations and language instructions.
While video generation world models are promising, their reliance on
pixel-level reconstruction often introduces visual redundancies that hinder
action decoding and generalization. Latent world models offer a compact,
motion-aware representation, but overlook the fine-grained details critical for
precise manipulation. To overcome these limitations, we propose MoWM, a
mixture-of-world-model framework that fuses representations from hybrid world
models for embodied action planning. Our approach uses motion-aware
representations from a latent model as a high-level prior, which guides the
extraction of fine-grained visual features from the pixel space model. This
design allows MoWM to highlight the informative visual details needed for
action decoding. Extensive evaluations on the CALVIN benchmark demonstrate that
our method achieves state-of-the-art task success rates and superior
generalization. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of the strengths of
each feature space, offering valuable insights for future research in embodied

Motivation: 现有的轨迹控制方法要么需要大量训练资源，要么专门为U-Net设计，未能充分利用DiT的优越性能。

Method: 1) 使用LLM将用户提示转换为前景和背景提示进行分离引导；2) 提出STD-RoPE通过修改前景token的位置嵌入来消除跨帧空间差异；3) 通过调节位置嵌入密度实现3D感知轨迹控制。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在视频质量和轨迹可控性方面均优于先前方法。

Conclusion: DiTraj是一个简单但有效的训练免费框架，成功实现了基于DiT的轨迹控制视频生成。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT)-based video generation models with 3D full
attention exhibit strong generative capabilities. Trajectory control represents
a user-friendly task in the field of controllable video generation. However,
existing methods either require substantial training resources or are
specifically designed for U-Net, do not take advantage of the superior
performance of DiT. To address these issues, we propose DiTraj, a simple but
effective training-free framework for trajectory control in text-to-video
generation, tailored for DiT. Specifically, first, to inject the object's
trajectory, we propose foreground-background separation guidance: we use the
Large Language Model (LLM) to convert user-provided prompts into foreground and
background prompts, which respectively guide the generation of foreground and
background regions in the video. Then, we analyze 3D full attention and explore
the tight correlation between inter-token attention scores and position
embedding. Based on this, we propose inter-frame Spatial-Temporal Decoupled
3D-RoPE (STD-RoPE). By modifying only foreground tokens' position embedding,
STD-RoPE eliminates their cross-frame spatial discrepancies, strengthening
cross-frame attention among them and thus enhancing trajectory control.
Additionally, we achieve 3D-aware trajectory control by regulating the density
of position embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms previous methods in both video quality and trajectory
controllability.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have advanced the field of question answering, but

lexical overlap and re-ranking. To further improve retrieval, we adapt the
EfficientRAG pipeline for query optimization, introducing token labeling and
iterative refinement while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on the HotpotQA
dataset show that the hybrid approach substantially outperforms baseline
methods, achieving a relative improvement of 50 percent in exact match and 47
percent in F1 score compared to cosine similarity. Error analysis reveals that
hybrid retrieval improves entity recall and evidence complementarity, while
remaining limited in handling distractors and temporal reasoning. Overall, the
results suggest that hybrid retrieval-augmented generation provides a practical
zero-shot solution for multi-hop question answering, balancing accuracy,
efficiency, and interpretability.

*Kaixuan Zhang,Zhipeng Xiong,Minxian Li,Mingwu Ren,Jiankang Deng,Xiatian Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出HDR-4DGS方法解决HDR动态新视角合成问题，通过动态色调映射模块连接HDR和LDR域，实现时间辐射一致性和空间准确的颜色转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HDR新视角合成方法主要关注静态场景，但现实场景经常包含动态元素，如移动物体和变化的光照条件，需要同时建模时间辐射变化和3D转换。

Method: 基于高斯泼溅的架构，引入创新的动态色调映射模块，根据时间维度上变化的辐射分布动态调整色调映射函数，保持时间辐射一致性。

Result: HDR-4DGS在定量性能和视觉保真度方面均优于现有最先进方法，能够从任意视角和时间实例生成逼真的HDR渲染。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了HDR动态新视角合成的复杂挑战，实现了时间辐射一致性和空间准确的颜色转换。

Abstract: High Dynamic Range Novel View Synthesis (HDR NVS) seeks to learn an HDR 3D
model from Low Dynamic Range (LDR) training images captured under conventional
imaging conditions. Current methods primarily focus on static scenes,
implicitly assuming all scene elements remain stationary and non-living.
However, real-world scenarios frequently feature dynamic elements, such as
moving objects, varying lighting conditions, and other temporal events, thereby
presenting a significantly more challenging scenario. To address this gap, we
propose a more realistic problem named HDR Dynamic Novel View Synthesis (HDR
DNVS), where the additional dimension ``Dynamic'' emphasizes the necessity of
jointly modeling temporal radiance variations alongside sophisticated 3D
translation between LDR and HDR. To tackle this complex, intertwined challenge,
we introduce HDR-4DGS, a Gaussian Splatting-based architecture featured with an
innovative dynamic tone-mapping module that explicitly connects HDR and LDR
domains, maintaining temporal radiance coherence by dynamically adapting
tone-mapping functions according to the evolving radiance distributions across
the temporal dimension. As a result, HDR-4DGS achieves both temporal radiance
consistency and spatially accurate color translation, enabling photorealistic
HDR renderings from arbitrary viewpoints and time instances. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that HDR-4DGS surpasses existing state-of-the-art
methods in both quantitative performance and visual fidelity. Source code will
be released.

Method: 提出几何感知隐式图像函数(GIIF)，通过联合优化隐式图像函数和显式3D手部形状，在提升图像分辨率的同时保持多视角和姿态一致性。

Result: 在InterHand2.6M和Goliath数据集上，SRHand在定量和定性评估中显著优于现有图像超分辨率和3D手部重建方法，能够重建皱纹、指甲等细节。

Conclusion: SRHand成功解决了从低分辨率图像重建详细手部几何的挑战，通过隐式-显式表示的结合实现了高质量的手部重建。

Abstract: Reconstructing detailed hand avatars plays a crucial role in various
applications. While prior works have focused on capturing high-fidelity hand
geometry, they heavily rely on high-resolution multi-view image inputs and
struggle to generalize on low-resolution images. Multi-view image
super-resolution methods have been proposed to enforce 3D view consistency.
These methods, however, are limited to static objects/scenes with fixed
resolutions and are not applicable to articulated deformable hands. In this
paper, we propose SRHand (Super-Resolution Hand), the method for reconstructing
detailed 3D geometry as well as textured images of hands from low-resolution
images. SRHand leverages the advantages of implicit image representation with
explicit hand meshes. Specifically, we introduce a geometric-aware implicit
image function (GIIF) that learns detailed hand prior by upsampling the coarse
input images. By jointly optimizing the implicit image function and explicit 3D
hand shapes, our method preserves multi-view and pose consistency among
upsampled hand images, and achieves fine-detailed 3D reconstruction (wrinkles,
nails). In experiments using the InterHand2.6M and Goliath datasets, our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art image upsampling methods adapted to
hand datasets, and 3D hand reconstruction methods, quantitatively and
qualitatively. Project page: https://yunminjin2.github.io/projects/srhand

*Janis Keuper,Margret Keuper*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文指出当前AI生成图像检测研究过于关注"假"图像而忽视了对"真实"图像的明确定义，认为需要重新思考"真实"图像的概念并建立新的基准数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代图像生成模型的普及引发了对其负面社会影响的担忧，但当前检测方法主要依赖过时的低分辨率"真实"图像数据集，而现代智能手机拍摄的图像实际上也经过神经网络算法处理，与"假"图像生成器技术相似。

Method: 这是一篇立场论文，通过分析当前图像检测研究现状，指出技术局限性，并提出需要重新定义"真实"图像概念。

Result: 分析显示当前几乎所有"假"图像检测方法的开发和评估都依赖于少数过时的低分辨率数据集，而现代图像采集技术已经发生了革命性变化。

Conclusion: 需要重新思考"真实"图像的概念，建立清晰的技术定义和新的基准数据集，甚至质疑检测"假"图像本身是否是一个合理的研究目标。

Abstract: The wide availability and low usability barrier of modern image generation
models has triggered the reasonable fear of criminal misconduct and negative
social implications. The machine learning community has been engaging this
problem with an extensive series of publications proposing algorithmic
solutions for the detection of "fake", e.g. entirely generated or partially
manipulated images. While there is undoubtedly some progress towards technical
solutions of the problem, we argue that current and prior work is focusing too
much on generative algorithms and "fake" data-samples, neglecting a clear
definition and data collection of "real" images. The fundamental question "what
is a real image?" might appear to be quite philosophical, but our analysis
shows that the development and evaluation of basically all current
"fake"-detection methods is relying on only a few, quite old low-resolution
datasets of "real" images like ImageNet. However, the technology for the
acquisition of "real" images, aka taking photos, has drastically evolved over
the last decade: Today, over 90% of all photographs are produced by smartphones
which typically use algorithms to compute an image from multiple inputs (over
time) from multiple sensors. Based on the fact that these image formation
algorithms are typically neural network architectures which are closely related
to "fake"-image generators, we state the position that today, we need to
re-think the concept of "real" images. The purpose of this position paper is to
raise the awareness of the current shortcomings in this active field of
research and to trigger an open discussion whether the detection of "fake"
images is a sound objective at all. At the very least, we need a clear
technical definition of "real" images and new benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: Aes-R1是一个用于多模态大语言模型的美学评估框架，通过强化学习结合链式思维推理，提升美学评分准确性和解释性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在图像美学评估方面具有潜力，但缺乏高质量的美学推理数据和美学判断的主观性限制了其准确性和可解释性

Method: 提出Aes-R1框架：1) AesCoT管道构建高质量链式思维美学推理数据；2) RAPO强化学习算法联合优化绝对评分回归和相对排序；3) 让模型在评分前生成结构化解释

Result: Aes-R1将骨干模型的平均PLCC/SRCC分别提升了47.9%/34.8%，在同等规模模型中超越最先进基线，在有限监督和分布外场景下表现出鲁棒泛化能力

Conclusion: Aes-R1能够在一个统一框架中同时提升美学评分和推理能力，使多模态大语言模型能够生成有依据的解释和可信的评分

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are well suited to image aesthetic
assessment, as they can capture high-level aesthetic features leveraging their
cross-modal understanding capacity. However, the scarcity of multimodal
aesthetic reasoning data and the inherently subjective nature of aesthetic
judgment make it difficult for MLLMs to generate accurate aesthetic judgments
with interpretable rationales. To this end, we propose Aes-R1, a comprehensive
aesthetic reasoning framework with reinforcement learning (RL). Concretely,
Aes-R1 integrates a pipeline, AesCoT, to construct and filter high-quality
chain-of-thought aesthetic reasoning data used for cold-start. After teaching
the model to generate structured explanations prior to scoring, we then employ
the Relative-Absolute Policy Optimization (RAPO), a novel RL algorithm that
jointly optimizes absolute score regression and relative ranking order,
improving both per-image accuracy and cross-image preference judgments. Aes-R1
enables MLLMs to generate grounded explanations alongside faithful scores,
thereby enhancing aesthetic scoring and reasoning in a unified framework.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Aes-R1 improves the backbone's average
PLCC/SRCC by 47.9%/34.8%, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines of similar
size. More ablation studies validate Aes-R1's robust generalization under
limited supervision and in out-of-distribution scenarios.

TL;DR: StableDub是一个基于Stable-Diffusion的视觉配音框架，通过唇部习惯建模和遮挡鲁棒合成，解决了传统方法无法捕捉说话者特定唇部习惯和处理遮挡物的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉配音方法存在两个关键缺陷：(1)仅依赖音频驱动无法捕捉说话者特定的唇部习惯，导致生成的唇部动作与目标头像不相似；(2)传统盲修复方法在处理遮挡物时经常产生视觉伪影，限制了实际部署。

Method: 基于Stable-Diffusion骨干网络，开发了唇部习惯调制机制，联合建模音素音频-视觉同步和说话者特定的口面部动态；引入遮挡感知训练策略，明确将遮挡物暴露给修复过程；采用混合Mamba-Transformer架构优化训练效率。

Result: 实验结果表明，StableDub在唇部习惯相似性和遮挡鲁棒性方面表现优异，在音频-唇部同步、视频质量和分辨率一致性方面也优于其他方法。

Conclusion: StableDub通过集成唇部习惯感知建模和遮挡鲁棒合成，显著提升了视觉配音的性能和实用性，特别在低资源研究场景中展现出增强的适用性。

Abstract: The visual dubbing task aims to generate mouth movements synchronized with
the driving audio, which has seen significant progress in recent years.
However, two critical deficiencies hinder their wide application: (1)
Audio-only driving paradigms inadequately capture speaker-specific lip habits,
which fail to generate lip movements similar to the target avatar; (2)
Conventional blind-inpainting approaches frequently produce visual artifacts
when handling obstructions (e.g., microphones, hands), limiting practical
deployment. In this paper, we propose StableDub, a novel and concise framework
integrating lip-habit-aware modeling with occlusion-robust synthesis.
Specifically, building upon the Stable-Diffusion backbone, we develop a
lip-habit-modulated mechanism that jointly models phonemic audio-visual
synchronization and speaker-specific orofacial dynamics. To achieve plausible
lip geometries and object appearances under occlusion, we introduce the
occlusion-aware training strategy by explicitly exposing the occlusion objects
to the inpainting process. By incorporating the proposed designs, the model
eliminates the necessity for cost-intensive priors in previous methods, thereby
exhibiting superior training efficiency on the computationally intensive
diffusion-based backbone. To further optimize training efficiency from the
perspective of model architecture, we introduce a hybrid Mamba-Transformer
architecture, which demonstrates the enhanced applicability in low-resource
research scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that StableDub
achieves superior performance in lip habit resemblance and occlusion
robustness. Our method also surpasses other methods in audio-lip sync, video
quality, and resolution consistency. We expand the applicability of visual
dubbing methods from comprehensive aspects, and demo videos can be found at

TL;DR: Drag4D是一个交互式框架，集成了文本驱动的3D场景生成中的物体运动控制，允许用户为3D物体定义轨迹并集成到高质量3D背景中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在将物体运动控制集成到文本驱动的3D场景生成方面存在不足，需要一种能够实现精确空间对齐和视图一致时间对齐的统一框架。

Method: 三阶段流程：1) 使用2D高斯泼溅和全景图像增强文本到3D背景生成；2) 采用3D复制粘贴方法，通过物理感知物体位置学习确保精确空间对齐；3) 使用部分增强、运动条件视频扩散模型实现时间动画。

Result: 通过各阶段评估和最终结果展示了统一架构的有效性，实现了用户控制物体运动与高质量3D背景的协调对齐。

Conclusion: Drag4D提供了一个完整的交互式框架，成功实现了3D物体运动控制与文本驱动场景生成的集成，解决了运动幻觉和视图一致性问题。

Abstract: We introduce Drag4D, an interactive framework that integrates object motion
control within text-driven 3D scene generation. This framework enables users to
define 3D trajectories for the 3D objects generated from a single image,
seamlessly integrating them into a high-quality 3D background. Our Drag4D
pipeline consists of three stages. First, we enhance text-to-3D background
generation by applying 2D Gaussian Splatting with panoramic images and
inpainted novel views, resulting in dense and visually complete 3D
reconstructions. In the second stage, given a reference image of the target
object, we introduce a 3D copy-and-paste approach: the target instance is
extracted in a full 3D mesh using an off-the-shelf image-to-3D model and
seamlessly composited into the generated 3D scene. The object mesh is then
positioned within the 3D scene via our physics-aware object position learning,
ensuring precise spatial alignment. Lastly, the spatially aligned object is
temporally animated along a user-defined 3D trajectory. To mitigate motion
hallucination and ensure view-consistent temporal alignment, we develop a
part-augmented, motion-conditioned video diffusion model that processes
multiview image pairs together with their projected 2D trajectories. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our unified architecture through evaluations
at each stage and in the final results, showcasing the harmonized alignment of
user-controlled object motion within a high-quality 3D background.

TL;DR: Syncphony是一个音频到视频生成模型，通过运动感知损失和音频同步引导技术，生成与音频精确同步的380x640分辨率、24fps视频，在同步精度和视觉质量上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频和图像到视频生成方法在控制运动时序方面存在局限，而音频提供了与视频运动对齐的时间线索，是时序控制视频生成的有前景条件。但现有音频到视频模型由于间接条件机制或有限的时间建模能力，难以实现细粒度同步。

Method: 基于预训练视频主干网络，引入两个关键组件：1) 运动感知损失，强调在高运动区域学习；2) 音频同步引导，使用视觉对齐的无音频层离同步模型来引导完整模型，在推理时更好地利用音频线索同时保持视觉质量。

Result: 在AVSync15和The Greatest Hits数据集上的实验表明，Syncphony在同步精度和视觉质量方面均优于现有方法。提出的CycleSync度量标准通过测量生成视频中的运动线索重建原始音频来评估同步效果。

Conclusion: Syncphony通过创新的运动感知损失和音频同步引导机制，成功实现了音频与视频的高质量同步生成，为时序控制的视频生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-video and image-to-video generation have made rapid progress in
visual quality, but they remain limited in controlling the precise timing of
motion. In contrast, audio provides temporal cues aligned with video motion,
making it a promising condition for temporally controlled video generation.
However, existing audio-to-video (A2V) models struggle with fine-grained
synchronization due to indirect conditioning mechanisms or limited temporal
modeling capacity. We present Syncphony, which generates 380x640 resolution,
24fps videos synchronized with diverse audio inputs. Our approach builds upon a
pre-trained video backbone and incorporates two key components to improve
synchronization: (1) Motion-aware Loss, which emphasizes learning at
high-motion regions; (2) Audio Sync Guidance, which guides the full model using
a visually aligned off-sync model without audio layers to better exploit audio
cues at inference while maintaining visual quality. To evaluate
synchronization, we propose CycleSync, a video-to-audio-based metric that
measures the amount of motion cues in the generated video to reconstruct the
original audio. Experiments on AVSync15 and The Greatest Hits datasets
demonstrate that Syncphony outperforms existing methods in both synchronization
accuracy and visual quality. Project page is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数基于深度学习的方法主要关注学习单模态视觉信息，而忽略了文本等多模态数据提供的丰富语义信息。

Method: 使用视觉基础模型(SAM2)作为特征提取器获取双时相遥感图像的多尺度金字塔特征，采用多层适配器进行下游任务微调，设计文本融合注意力模块(TFAM)对齐视觉和文本信息，通过视觉-语义融合解码器(V-SFD)深度融合视觉和语义信息生成变化检测掩码。

Result: 在三个数据集(LEVIR-CD、WHU-CD和SYSU-CD)上的实验表明，LG-CD持续优于最先进的变化检测方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为利用多模态信息实现广义变化检测提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Remote Sensing Change Detection (RSCD) typically identifies changes in land
cover or surface conditions by analyzing multi-temporal images. Currently, most
deep learning-based methods primarily focus on learning unimodal visual
information, while neglecting the rich semantic information provided by
multimodal data such as text. To address this limitation, we propose a novel
Language-Guided Change Detection model (LG-CD). This model leverages natural
language prompts to direct the network's attention to regions of interest,
significantly improving the accuracy and robustness of change detection.
Specifically, LG-CD utilizes a visual foundational model (SAM2) as a feature
extractor to capture multi-scale pyramid features from high-resolution to
low-resolution across bi-temporal remote sensing images. Subsequently,
multi-layer adapters are employed to fine-tune the model for downstream tasks,
ensuring its effectiveness in remote sensing change detection. Additionally, we
design a Text Fusion Attention Module (TFAM) to align visual and textual
information, enabling the model to focus on target change regions using text
prompts. Finally, a Vision-Semantic Fusion Decoder (V-SFD) is implemented,
which deeply integrates visual and semantic information through a
cross-attention mechanism to produce highly accurate change detection masks.
Our experiments on three datasets (LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and SYSU-CD) demonstrate
that LG-CD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art change detection methods.
Furthermore, our approach provides new insights into achieving generalized
change detection by leveraging multimodal information.

Abstract: This paper explores image editing under the joint control of text and drag
interactions. While recent advances in text-driven and drag-driven editing have
achieved remarkable progress, they suffer from complementary limitations:
text-driven methods excel in texture manipulation but lack precise spatial
control, whereas drag-driven approaches primarily modify shape and structure
without fine-grained texture guidance. To address these limitations, we propose
a unified diffusion-based framework for joint drag-text image editing,
integrating the strengths of both paradigms. Our framework introduces two key
innovations: (1) Point-Cloud Deterministic Drag, which enhances latent-space
layout control through 3D feature mapping, and (2) Drag-Text Guided Denoising,
dynamically balancing the influence of drag and text conditions during
denoising. Notably, our model supports flexible editing modes - operating with
text-only, drag-only, or combined conditions - while maintaining strong
performance in each setting. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments
demonstrate that our method not only achieves high-fidelity joint editing but
also matches or surpasses the performance of specialized text-only or drag-only
approaches, establishing a versatile and generalizable solution for
controllable image manipulation. Code will be made publicly available to
reproduce all results presented in this work.

Abstract: Aside from common challenges in remote sensing like small, sparse targets and
computation cost limitations, detecting vehicles from UAV images in the Nordic
regions faces strong visibility challenges and domain shifts caused by diverse
levels of snow coverage. Although annotated data are expensive, unannotated
data is cheaper to obtain by simply flying the drones. In this work, we
proposed a sideload-CL-adaptation framework that enables the use of unannotated
data to improve vehicle detection using lightweight models. Specifically, we
propose to train a CNN-based representation extractor through contrastive
learning on the unannotated data in the pretraining stage, and then sideload it
to a frozen YOLO11n backbone in the fine-tuning stage. To find a robust
sideload-CL-adaptation, we conducted extensive experiments to compare various
fusion methods and granularity. Our proposed sideload-CL-adaptation model
improves the detection performance by 3.8% to 9.5% in terms of mAP50 on the NVD

Conclusion: IF-V2V方法成功实现了无需反演的高质量视频编辑，为视觉创意提供了有效的工具。

Abstract: Although image editing techniques have advanced significantly, video editing,
which aims to manipulate videos according to user intent, remains an emerging
challenge. Most existing image-conditioned video editing methods either require
inversion with model-specific design or need extensive optimization, limiting
their capability of leveraging up-to-date image-to-video (I2V) models to
transfer the editing capability of image editing models to the video domain. To
this end, we propose IF-V2V, an Inversion-Free method that can adapt
off-the-shelf flow-matching-based I2V models for video editing without
significant computational overhead. To circumvent inversion, we devise Vector
Field Rectification with Sample Deviation to incorporate information from the
source video into the denoising process by introducing a deviation term into
the denoising vector field. To further ensure consistency with the source video
in a model-agnostic way, we introduce Structure-and-Motion-Preserving
Initialization to generate motion-aware temporally correlated noise with
structural information embedded. We also present a Deviation Caching mechanism
to minimize the additional computational cost for denoising vector
rectification without significantly impacting editing quality. Evaluations
demonstrate that our method achieves superior editing quality and consistency
over existing approaches, offering a lightweight plug-and-play solution to
realize visual creativity.

Abstract: Multi-view counting (MVC) methods have attracted significant research
attention and stimulated remarkable progress in recent years. Despite their
success, most MVC methods have focused on improving performance by following
the fully supervised learning (FSL) paradigm, which often requires large
amounts of annotated data. In this work, we propose SSLCounter, a novel
self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for MVC that leverages neural
volumetric rendering to alleviate the reliance on large-scale annotated
datasets. SSLCounter learns an implicit representation w.r.t. the scene,
enabling the reconstruction of continuous geometry shape and the complex,
view-dependent appearance of their 2D projections via differential neural
rendering. Owing to its inherent flexibility, the key idea of our method can be
seamlessly integrated into exsiting frameworks. Notably, extensive experiments
demonstrate that SSLCounter not only demonstrates state-of-the-art performances
but also delivers competitive performance with only using 70% proportion of
training data, showcasing its superior data efficiency across multiple MVC
benchmarks.

Result: 发现检测器（如GroundingDINO和OWLv2）提供精确的边界框但有限的关系推理能力，而VLM（如SmolVLM和GPT-4o）提供粗略的布局线索和流畅的描述但在细粒度空间上下文方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了定位精度与真正空间理解之间的差距，指出社区需要开发具有空间感知能力的基础模型。

Abstract: Spatial understanding is a critical capability for vision foundation models.
While recent advances in large vision models or vision-language models (VLMs)
have expanded recognition capabilities, most benchmarks emphasize localization
accuracy rather than whether models capture how objects are arranged and
related within a scene. This gap is consequential; effective scene
understanding requires not only identifying objects, but reasoning about their
relative positions, groupings, and depth. In this paper, we present a
systematic benchmark for object-centric spatial reasoning in foundation models.
Using a controlled synthetic dataset, we evaluate state-of-the-art vision
models (e.g., GroundingDINO, Florence-2, OWLv2) and large VLMs (e.g., InternVL,
LLaVA, GPT-4o) across three tasks: spatial localization, spatial reasoning, and
downstream retrieval tasks. We find a stable trade-off: detectors such as
GroundingDINO and OWLv2 deliver precise boxes with limited relational
reasoning, while VLMs like SmolVLM and GPT-4o provide coarse layout cues and
fluent captions but struggle with fine-grained spatial context. Our study
highlights the gap between localization and true spatial understanding, and
pointing toward the need for spatially-aware foundation models in the
community.

### [82] [PANICL: Mitigating Over-Reliance on Single Prompt in Visual In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21926)
*Jiahao Zhang,Bowen Wang,Hong Liu,Yuta Nakashima,Hajime Nagahara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PANICL是一个无需训练的训练框架，通过利用多个上下文图像对来缓解视觉上下文学习中的单对依赖问题，提高预测的稳定性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉上下文学习(VICL)通常过度依赖单个上下文图像对，导致预测存在偏见和不稳定。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出基于补丁的k最近邻视觉上下文学习(PANICL)框架，通过平滑多个上下文对的分配分数来减少偏见，无需额外训练。

Result: 在多种视觉任务上的实验表明，PANICL相比基线方法有持续改进，并对领域偏移表现出强鲁棒性，能泛化到其他VICL模型。

Conclusion: PANICL是一个通用且多功能的框架，能有效提升视觉上下文学习的性能和鲁棒性，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) uses input-output image pairs, referred to
as in-context pairs (or examples), as prompts alongside query images to guide
models in performing diverse vision tasks. However, VICL often suffers from
over-reliance on a single in-context pair, which can lead to biased and
unstable predictions. We introduce PAtch-based $k$-Nearest neighbor visual
In-Context Learning (PANICL), a general training-free framework that mitigates
this issue by leveraging multiple in-context pairs. PANICL smooths assignment
scores across pairs, reducing bias without requiring additional training.
Extensive experiments on a variety of tasks, including foreground segmentation,
single object detection, colorization, multi-object segmentation, and keypoint
detection, demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. Moreover,
PANICL exhibits strong robustness to domain shifts, including dataset-level
shift (e.g., from COCO to Pascal) and label-space shift (e.g., FSS-1000), and
generalizes well to other VICL models such as SegGPT, Painter, and LVM,
highlighting its versatility and broad applicability.

*Jiahui Wang,Haiyue Zhu,Haoren Guo,Abdullah Al Mamun,Cheng Xiang,Tong Heng Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SingRef6D是一个轻量级的6D姿态估计方法，仅需单张RGB图像作为参考，无需深度传感器、多视图图像或神经场训练。通过改进的深度预测和深度感知匹配，在挑战性材料和光照条件下表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有6D姿态估计方法依赖深度传感器，在透明或高反射表面会失效；RGB方法在低光和无纹理场景中匹配性能不足。需要一种不依赖深度传感器且能处理挑战性场景的解决方案。

Method: 1. 基于Depth-Anything v2的token-scaler微调机制，改进深度预测精度；2. 深度感知匹配过程，在LoFTR中集成空间关系，处理挑战性材料和光照条件。

Result: 在REAL275深度预测上相比Depth-Anything v2提升14.41%；在REAL275、ClearPose和Toyota-Light数据集上的姿态估计平均召回率提升6.1%，超越现有最佳方法。

Conclusion: SingRef6D提供了一种轻量级且鲁棒的6D姿态估计解决方案，在资源受限和挑战性场景下表现出色，无需昂贵的深度传感器或多视图采集。

Abstract: Recent 6D pose estimation methods demonstrate notable performance but still
face some practical limitations. For instance, many of them rely heavily on
sensor depth, which may fail with challenging surface conditions, such as
transparent or highly reflective materials. In the meantime, RGB-based
solutions provide less robust matching performance in low-light and
texture-less scenes due to the lack of geometry information. Motivated by
these, we propose SingRef6D, a lightweight pipeline requiring only a single RGB
image as a reference, eliminating the need for costly depth sensors, multi-view
image acquisition, or training view synthesis models and neural fields. This
enables SingRef6D to remain robust and capable even under resource-limited
settings where depth or dense templates are unavailable. Our framework
incorporates two key innovations. First, we propose a token-scaler-based
fine-tuning mechanism with a novel optimization loss on top of Depth-Anything
v2 to enhance its ability to predict accurate depth, even for challenging
surfaces. Our results show a 14.41% improvement (in $\delta_{1.05}$) on REAL275
depth prediction compared to Depth-Anything v2 (with fine-tuned head). Second,
benefiting from depth availability, we introduce a depth-aware matching process
that effectively integrates spatial relationships within LoFTR, enabling our
system to handle matching for challenging materials and lighting conditions.
Evaluations of pose estimation on the REAL275, ClearPose, and Toyota-Light
datasets show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, achieving a
6.1% improvement in average recall.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SemanticControl方法，解决ControlNet在使用语义相关但未对齐的视觉条件时的问题，通过自适应抑制视觉条件与文本提示冲突的部分，增强文本引导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ControlNet依赖与生成目标精确对齐的视觉条件，但在实践中常遇到条件不匹配的情况，特别是在不常见或想象场景中。现有方法难以使用语义相关但未对齐的视觉条件。

Method: 训练免费方法，首先使用与视觉条件对齐的代理提示进行辅助去噪过程提取注意力掩码，然后在实际目标提示的去噪过程中利用这些掩码自适应调节视觉条件的影响。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在深度图、边缘图和人体骨骼等各种松散对齐条件下都能提升性能，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: SemanticControl能够有效利用语义相关但未对齐的视觉条件，在保持文本忠实度的同时减少视觉伪影，为扩散模型提供了更灵活的视觉控制能力。

Abstract: ControlNet has enabled detailed spatial control in text-to-image diffusion
models by incorporating additional visual conditions such as depth or edge
maps. However, its effectiveness heavily depends on the availability of visual
conditions that are precisely aligned with the generation goal specified by
text prompt-a requirement that often fails in practice, especially for uncommon
or imaginative scenes. For example, generating an image of a cat cooking in a
specific pose may be infeasible due to the lack of suitable visual conditions.
In contrast, structurally similar cues can often be found in more common
settings-for instance, poses of humans cooking are widely available and can
serve as rough visual guides. Unfortunately, existing ControlNet models
struggle to use such loosely aligned visual conditions, often resulting in low
text fidelity or visual artifacts. To address this limitation, we propose
SemanticControl, a training-free method for effectively leveraging misaligned
but semantically relevant visual conditions. Our approach adaptively suppresses
the influence of the visual condition where it conflicts with the prompt, while
strengthening guidance from the text. The key idea is to first run an auxiliary
denoising process using a surrogate prompt aligned with the visual condition
(e.g., "a human playing guitar" for a human pose condition) to extract
informative attention masks, and then utilize these masks during the denoising
of the actual target prompt (e.g., cat playing guitar). Experimental results
demonstrate that our method improves performance under loosely aligned
conditions across various conditions, including depth maps, edge maps, and
human skeletons, outperforming existing baselines. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个用于评估多模态大语言模型视觉情感感知能力的自动化评估框架，通过情感陈述判断任务系统评估主流MLLMs的情感理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在图像情感感知方面的能力存在争议，主要由于评估方法的局限性，包括忽略合理响应、情感分类有限、忽视上下文因素和人工标注成本高等问题。

Method: 提出了情感陈述判断任务，并设计了一个自动化流水线来高效构建情感相关陈述，最小化人工参与。

Result: 研究发现MLLMs在情感解释和基于上下文的情感判断方面表现较强，但在理解感知主观性方面相对受限。与人类相比，即使是表现最好的GPT4o也存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 通过开发基础评估框架并进行全面的MLLM评估，该研究为推进MLLMs的情感智能发展做出了贡献。

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved exceptional
performance across diverse tasks, continually surpassing previous expectations
regarding their capabilities. Nevertheless, their proficiency in perceiving
emotions from images remains debated, with studies yielding divergent results
in zero-shot scenarios. We argue that this inconsistency stems partly from
constraints in existing evaluation methods, including the oversight of
plausible responses, limited emotional taxonomies, neglect of contextual
factors, and labor-intensive annotations. To facilitate customized visual
emotion evaluation for MLLMs, we propose an Emotion Statement Judgment task
that overcomes these constraints. Complementing this task, we devise an
automated pipeline that efficiently constructs emotion-centric statements with
minimal human effort. Through systematically evaluating prevailing MLLMs, our
study showcases their stronger performance in emotion interpretation and
context-based emotion judgment, while revealing relative limitations in
comprehending perception subjectivity. When compared to humans, even
top-performing MLLMs like GPT4o demonstrate remarkable performance gaps,
underscoring key areas for future improvement. By developing a fundamental
evaluation framework and conducting a comprehensive MLLM assessment, we hope
this work contributes to advancing emotional intelligence in MLLMs. Project

Motivation: 现有基于上下文学习的方法依赖简单的重建目标，导致严重的属性泄漏和无法对齐人类偏好，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 1) 引入显式位置监督分离不同主体的注意力区域；2) 使用专家混合架构增强模型能力；3) 设计在线强化学习框架进行偏好对齐。

Result: 实验验证该框架显著提高了主体保真度，并更好地对齐了人类偏好。

Conclusion: MultiCrafter通过位置监督、MoE架构和强化学习有效解决了多主体图像生成中的属性泄漏和偏好对齐问题。

Abstract: Multi-subject image generation aims to synthesize user-provided subjects in a
single image while preserving subject fidelity, ensuring prompt consistency,
and aligning with human aesthetic preferences. However, existing methods,
particularly those built on the In-Context-Learning paradigm, are limited by
their reliance on simple reconstruction-based objectives, leading to both
severe attribute leakage that compromises subject fidelity and failing to align
with nuanced human preferences. To address this, we propose MultiCrafter, a
framework that ensures high-fidelity, preference-aligned generation. First, we
find that the root cause of attribute leakage is a significant entanglement of
attention between different subjects during the generation process. Therefore,
we introduce explicit positional supervision to explicitly separate attention
regions for each subject, effectively mitigating attribute leakage. To enable
the model to accurately plan the attention region of different subjects in
diverse scenarios, we employ a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to enhance the
model's capacity, allowing different experts to focus on different scenarios.
Finally, we design a novel online reinforcement learning framework to align the
model with human preferences, featuring a scoring mechanism to accurately
assess multi-subject fidelity and a more stable training strategy tailored for
the MoE architecture. Experiments validate that our framework significantly
improves subject fidelity while aligning with human preferences better.

Motivation: 现有开放世界部件分割方法通常从2D基础模型转移监督，但无法捕捉内在几何特征，导致表面理解受限、分解不可控和泛化能力有限。

Method: 采用triplane-based双分支编码器生成空间结构化token，结合模型在环标注流程从在线资源中筛选超过500万个3D形状-部件对进行大规模监督学习。

Result: PartSAM在多个基准测试中大幅超越最先进方法，实现了高度准确的部件识别，并能自动将形状分解为表面和内部结构。

Conclusion: PartSAM标志着向3D部件理解基础模型迈出了决定性一步，其代码和模型即将发布。

Abstract: Segmenting 3D objects into parts is a long-standing challenge in computer
vision. To overcome taxonomy constraints and generalize to unseen 3D objects,
recent works turn to open-world part segmentation. These approaches typically
transfer supervision from 2D foundation models, such as SAM, by lifting
multi-view masks into 3D. However, this indirect paradigm fails to capture
intrinsic geometry, leading to surface-only understanding, uncontrolled
decomposition, and limited generalization. We present PartSAM, the first
promptable part segmentation model trained natively on large-scale 3D data.
Following the design philosophy of SAM, PartSAM employs an encoder-decoder
architecture in which a triplane-based dual-branch encoder produces spatially
structured tokens for scalable part-aware representation learning. To enable
large-scale supervision, we further introduce a model-in-the-loop annotation
pipeline that curates over five million 3D shape-part pairs from online assets,
providing diverse and fine-grained labels. This combination of scalable
architecture and diverse 3D data yields emergent open-world capabilities: with
a single prompt, PartSAM achieves highly accurate part identification, and in a
Segment-Every-Part mode, it automatically decomposes shapes into both surface
and internal structures. Extensive experiments show that PartSAM outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by large margins across multiple benchmarks, marking a
decisive step toward foundation models for 3D part understanding. Our code and
model will be released soon.

Abstract: Image contrast was a fundamental factor in visual perception and played a
vital role in overall image quality. However, most no reference image quality
assessment NR IQA models struggled to accurately evaluate contrast distortions
under diverse real world conditions. In this study, we proposed a deep learning
based framework for blind contrast quality assessment by customizing and
fine-tuning three pre trained architectures, EfficientNet B0, ResNet18, and
MobileNetV2, for perceptual Mean Opinion Score, along with an additional model
built on a Siamese network, which indicated a limited ability to capture
perceptual contrast distortions. Each model is modified with a contrast-aware
regression head and trained end to end using targeted data augmentations on two
benchmark datasets, CID2013 and CCID2014, containing synthetic and authentic
contrast distortions. Performance is evaluated using Pearson Linear Correlation
Coefficient and Spearman Rank Order Correlation Coefficient, which assess the
alignment between predicted and human rated scores. Among these three models,
our customized EfficientNet B0 model achieved state-of-the-art performance with
PLCC = 0.9286 and SRCC = 0.9178 on CCID2014 and PLCC = 0.9581 and SRCC = 0.9369
on CID2013, surpassing traditional methods and outperforming other deep
baselines. These results highlighted the models robustness and effectiveness in
capturing perceptual contrast distortion. Overall, the proposed method
demonstrated that contrast aware adaptation of lightweight pre trained networks
can yield a high performing, scalable solution for no reference contrast
quality assessment suitable for real time and resource constrained
applications.

Result: 在三个精心设计的少样本地理空间指代表达基准测试中，Geo-R1模型持续且显著优于监督微调基线，并展现出强大的跨数据集泛化能力。

Conclusion: Geo-R1通过推理中心的强化微调方法，在少样本地理空间指代表达理解任务中实现了更好的泛化性能和可解释性，为解决数据稀缺场景下的遥感图像理解问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Referring expression understanding in remote sensing poses unique challenges,
as it requires reasoning over complex object-context relationships. While
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on multimodal large language models achieves
strong performance with massive labeled datasets, they struggle in data-scarce
scenarios, leading to poor generalization. To address this limitation, we
propose Geo-R1, a reasoning-centric reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) paradigm
for few-shot geospatial referring. Geo-R1 enforces the model to first generate
explicit, interpretable reasoning chains that decompose referring expressions,
and then leverage these rationales to localize target objects. This "reason
first, then act" process enables the model to make more effective use of
limited annotations, enhances generalization, and provides interpretability. We
validate Geo-R1 on three carefully designed few-shot geospatial referring
benchmarks, where our model consistently and substantially outperforms SFT
baselines. It also demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization,
highlighting its robustness. Code and data will be released at

Abstract: Vision language models(VLMs) are increasingly integrated into clinical
workflows, but they often exhibit sycophantic behavior prioritizing alignment
with user phrasing social cues or perceived authority over evidence based
reasoning. This study evaluate clinical sycophancy in medical visual question
answering through a novel clinically grounded benchmark. We propose a medical
sycophancy dataset construct from PathVQA, SLAKE, and VQA-RAD stratified by
different type organ system and modality. Using psychologically motivated
pressure templates including various sycophancy. In our adversarial experiments
on various VLMs, we found that these models are generally vulnerable,
exhibiting significant variations in the occurrence of adversarial responses,
with weak correlations to the model accuracy or size. Imitation and expert
provided corrections were found to be the most effective triggers, suggesting
that the models possess a bias mechanism independent of visual evidence. To
address this, we propose Visual Information Purification for Evidence based
Response (VIPER) a lightweight mitigation strategy that filters non evidentiary
content for example social pressures and then generates constrained evidence
first answers. This framework reduces sycophancy by an average amount
outperforming baselines while maintaining interpretability. Our benchmark
analysis and mitigation framework lay the groundwork for robust deployment of
medical VLMs in real world clinician interactions emphasizing the need for

Motivation: 随着智能眼镜的普及，用户的注视数据被整合到视觉语言模型中，但注视数据存在模糊性挑战：用户的言语问题可能使用代词或跳过上下文，而人类注视模式可能嘈杂且与口语问题存在复杂的时空关系。

Method: 首先分析注视模态的查询样本，展示用户注视模式的嘈杂性；然后使用GPT-4o设计自动数据合成管道生成GLARIFY-Ambi数据集，包含专门的思维链过程来处理嘈杂注视模式；最后设计热图模块将注视信息整合到先进的视觉语言模型中，同时保留其预训练知识。

Conclusion: 通过稳健地将视觉语言模型与人类注意力对齐，GLARIFY为与视觉助手建立可用且直观的交互范式铺平了道路。

Abstract: With the rise in popularity of smart glasses, users' attention has been
integrated into Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to streamline multi-modal
querying in daily scenarios. However, leveraging gaze data to model users'
attention may introduce ambiguity challenges: (1) users' verbal questions
become ambiguous by using pronouns or skipping context, (2) humans' gaze
patterns can be noisy and exhibit complex spatiotemporal relationships with
their spoken questions. Previous works only consider single image as visual
modality input, failing to capture the dynamic nature of the user's attention.
In this work, we introduce GLARIFY, a novel method to leverage spatiotemporal
gaze information to enhance the model's effectiveness in real-world
applications. Initially, we analyzed hundreds of querying samples with the gaze
modality to demonstrate the noisy nature of users' gaze patterns. We then
utilized GPT-4o to design an automatic data synthesis pipeline to generate the
GLARIFY-Ambi dataset, which includes a dedicated chain-of-thought (CoT) process
to handle noisy gaze patterns. Finally, we designed a heatmap module to
incorporate gaze information into cutting-edge VLMs while preserving their
pretrained knowledge. We evaluated GLARIFY using a hold-out test set.
Experiments demonstrate that GLARIFY significantly outperforms baselines. By
robustly aligning VLMs with human attention, GLARIFY paves the way for a usable
and intuitive interaction paradigm with a visual assistant.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了大型视觉语言模型的空间偏见问题，发现模型对相同视觉信息在不同位置会产生不一致输出，并提出平衡位置分配机制来提升空间鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在多模态任务中表现出色，但其对空间变化的鲁棒性尚未得到充分理解。当相同的关键视觉信息放置在不同位置时，模型会产生不一致的输出，这揭示了其空间语义理解的根本局限性。

Method: 通过精心设计的探测数据集分析空间偏见，发现问题源于语言模型中位置嵌入的不平衡设计。提出平衡位置分配机制，为所有图像标记分配相同的位置嵌入，促进更平衡的视觉信息整合。

Result: 实验表明，BaPA无需重新训练即可增强LVLMs的空间鲁棒性，结合轻量级微调还能进一步提升在多种多模态基准测试中的性能。信息流分析显示BaPA产生平衡的注意力，实现更全面的视觉理解。

Conclusion: 当前LVLMs存在显著的空间偏见问题，主要源于位置嵌入的不平衡设计。BaPA机制能有效缓解这一问题，提升模型的空间鲁棒性和整体性能，为更平衡的多模态理解提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable success across
a wide range of multimodal tasks, yet their robustness to spatial variations
remains insufficiently understood. In this work, we present a systematic study
of the spatial bias of LVLMs, focusing on how models respond when identical key
visual information is placed at different locations within an image. Through a
carefully designed probing dataset, we demonstrate that current LVLMs often
produce inconsistent outputs under such spatial shifts, revealing a fundamental
limitation in their spatial-semantic understanding. Further analysis shows that
this phenomenon originates not from the vision encoder, which reliably
perceives and interprets visual content across positions, but from the
unbalanced design of position embeddings in the language model component. In
particular, the widely adopted position embedding strategies, such as RoPE,
introduce imbalance during cross-modal interaction, leading image tokens at
different positions to exert unequal influence on semantic understanding. To
mitigate this issue, we introduce Balanced Position Assignment (BaPA), a simple
yet effective mechanism that assigns identical position embeddings to all image
tokens, promoting a more balanced integration of visual information. Extensive
experiments show that BaPA enhances the spatial robustness of LVLMs without
retraining and further boosts their performance across diverse multimodal
benchmarks when combined with lightweight fine-tuning. Further analysis of
information flow reveals that BaPA yields balanced attention, enabling more
holistic visual understanding.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for disentangling visual and semantic features
from the backbones of pre-trained diffusion models, enabling visual
correspondence in a manner analogous to the well-established semantic
correspondence. While diffusion model backbones are known to encode
semantically rich features, they must also contain visual features to support
their image synthesis capabilities. However, isolating these visual features is
challenging due to the absence of annotated datasets. To address this, we
introduce an automated pipeline that constructs image pairs with annotated
semantic and visual correspondences based on existing subject-driven image
generation datasets, and design a contrastive architecture to separate the two
feature types. Leveraging the disentangled representations, we propose a new
metric, Visual Semantic Matching (VSM), that quantifies visual inconsistencies
in subject-driven image generation. Empirical results show that our approach
outperforms global feature-based metrics such as CLIP, DINO, and
vision--language models in quantifying visual inconsistencies while also
enabling spatial localization of inconsistent regions. To our knowledge, this
is the first method that supports both quantification and localization of
inconsistencies in subject-driven generation, offering a valuable tool for
advancing this task. Project

TL;DR: ERGO提出了一种从粗到精的两阶段推理管道，通过先分析下采样图像识别任务相关区域，然后仅对相关区域进行全分辨率处理，显著减少计算成本同时保留必要的视觉细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型在处理高分辨率图像时会产生大量视觉标记，导致计算开销巨大。随着'图像思维'模型的出现，推理能力扩展到视觉领域，这启发了从粗到精的推理方法。

Method: 采用两阶段'从粗到精'推理管道：第一阶段分析下采样图像识别任务相关区域；第二阶段仅对相关区域进行全分辨率处理。通过强化学习框架开发奖励组件，实现推理驱动的感知。

Result: 在多个数据集上，ERGO比原始模型和竞争方法获得更高准确率且效率更高。例如在V*基准上超越Qwen2.5-VL-7B 4.7分，仅使用23%的视觉标记，实现3倍推理加速。

Conclusion: ERGO通过推理驱动的感知方法，在保持准确性的同时显著提高了处理高分辨率图像的效率，为实际视觉语言应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient processing of high-resolution images is crucial for real-world
vision-language applications. However, existing Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) incur substantial computational overhead due to the large number of
vision tokens. With the advent of "thinking with images" models, reasoning now
extends beyond text to the visual domain. This capability motivates our
two-stage "coarse-to-fine" reasoning pipeline: first, a downsampled image is
analyzed to identify task-relevant regions; then, only these regions are
cropped at full resolution and processed in a subsequent reasoning stage. This
approach reduces computational cost while preserving fine-grained visual
details where necessary. A major challenge lies in inferring which regions are
truly relevant to a given query. Recent related methods often fail in the first
stage after input-image downsampling, due to perception-driven reasoning, where
clear visual information is required for effective reasoning. To address this
issue, we propose ERGO (Efficient Reasoning & Guided Observation) that performs
reasoning-driven perception-leveraging multimodal context to determine where to
focus. Our model can account for perceptual uncertainty, expanding the cropped
region to cover visually ambiguous areas for answering questions. To this end,
we develop simple yet effective reward components in a reinforcement learning
framework for coarse-to-fine perception. Across multiple datasets, our approach
delivers higher accuracy than the original model and competitive methods, with
greater efficiency. For instance, ERGO surpasses Qwen2.5-VL-7B on the V*
benchmark by 4.7 points while using only 23% of the vision tokens, achieving a
3x inference speedup. The code and models can be found at:

*Sungmin Woo,Sangyoun Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualFocus是一个基于深度学习的Depth-from-Focus框架，通过联合建模空间和焦距维度的焦点变化，利用变分公式和双重约束来提高复杂场景下的深度估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的学习型DFF方法在复杂场景（如精细纹理或深度突变区域）中表现不佳，因为焦点线索可能变得模糊或误导。

Method: 提出DualFocus框架，采用变分公式和双重约束：空间约束利用梯度模式变化区分真实深度边缘和纹理伪影，焦距约束强制焦点概率符合物理焦点行为的单峰单调性。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上的综合实验表明，DualFocus在深度精度和感知质量方面持续优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: DualFocus通过引入符合物理焦点行为的归纳偏置，显著提高了DFF在挑战性区域的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Depth-from-Focus (DFF) enables precise depth estimation by analyzing focus
cues across a stack of images captured at varying focal lengths. While recent
learning-based approaches have advanced this field, they often struggle in
complex scenes with fine textures or abrupt depth changes, where focus cues may
become ambiguous or misleading. We present DualFocus, a novel DFF framework
that leverages the focal stack's unique gradient patterns induced by focus
variation, jointly modeling focus changes over spatial and focal dimensions.
Our approach introduces a variational formulation with dual constraints
tailored to DFF: spatial constraints exploit gradient pattern changes across
focus levels to distinguish true depth edges from texture artifacts, while
focal constraints enforce unimodal, monotonic focus probabilities aligned with
physical focus behavior. These inductive biases improve robustness and accuracy
in challenging regions. Comprehensive experiments on four public datasets
demonstrate that DualFocus consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
both depth accuracy and perceptual quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有协作感知研究缺乏理论基础，特别是在任务性能与通信量之间的权衡方面。需要建立理论框架来指导设计最优通信策略。

Method: 引入实用率失真理论分析多智能体协作；提出RDcomm框架：1）任务熵离散编码，为特征分配任务相关码字长度；2）互信息驱动消息选择，使用互信息神经估计实现无冗余传输。

Result: 在DAIR-V2X和OPV2V数据集上，RDcomm在3D目标检测和BEV分割任务中达到最先进精度，同时通信量减少高达108倍。

Conclusion: 基于信息论的实用率失真理论为多智能体协作感知提供了理论基础，RDcomm框架通过优化信息传输效率实现了性能与通信量的最佳平衡。

Abstract: Collaborative perception emphasizes enhancing environmental understanding by
enabling multiple agents to share visual information with limited bandwidth
resources. While prior work has explored the empirical trade-off between task
performance and communication volume, a significant gap remains in the
theoretical foundation. To fill this gap, we draw on information theory and
introduce a pragmatic rate-distortion theory for multi-agent collaboration,
specifically formulated to analyze performance-communication trade-off in
goal-oriented multi-agent systems. This theory concretizes two key conditions
for designing optimal communication strategies: supplying pragmatically
relevant information and transmitting redundancy-less messages. Guided by these
two conditions, we propose RDcomm, a communication-efficient collaborative
perception framework that introduces two key innovations: i) task entropy
discrete coding, which assigns features with task-relevant codeword-lengths to
maximize the efficiency in supplying pragmatic information; ii)
mutual-information-driven message selection, which utilizes mutual information
neural estimation to approach the optimal redundancy-less condition.
Experiments on 3D object detection and BEV segmentation demonstrate that RDcomm
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on DAIR-V2X and OPV2V, while reducing
communication volume by up to 108 times. The code will be released.

TL;DR: FailureAtlas是一个主动探索文本到图像模型失败模式的框架，通过结构化搜索发现最小化失败诱导概念，揭示了超过24.7万个未知错误切片，并将失败与训练数据稀缺联系起来。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态基准测试在比较文本到图像模型方面提供了基础，但其被动设计诊断能力有限，难以发现系统性失败的全貌或隔离根本原因。需要一种互补的主动探索范式。

Method: FailureAtlas将错误发现框架化为对最小化失败诱导概念的结构化搜索。虽然这是一个计算爆炸性问题，但通过新颖的加速技术使其变得可行。

Result: 应用于Stable Diffusion模型时，该方法发现了超过24.7万个先前未知的错误切片，并首次提供了大规模证据将这些失败与训练集中的数据稀缺联系起来。

Conclusion: FailureAtlas通过提供原则性和可扩展的深度模型审计引擎，建立了一种新的、以诊断为先的方法论，指导开发更稳健的生成式AI。

Abstract: Static benchmarks have provided a valuable foundation for comparing
Text-to-Image (T2I) models. However, their passive design offers limited
diagnostic power, struggling to uncover the full landscape of systematic
failures or isolate their root causes. We argue for a complementary paradigm:
active exploration. We introduce FailureAtlas, the first framework designed to
autonomously explore and map the vast failure landscape of T2I models at scale.
FailureAtlas frames error discovery as a structured search for minimal,
failure-inducing concepts. While it is a computationally explosive problem, we
make it tractable with novel acceleration techniques. When applied to Stable
Diffusion models, our method uncovers hundreds of thousands of previously
unknown error slices (over 247,000 in SD1.5 alone) and provides the first
large-scale evidence linking these failures to data scarcity in the training
set. By providing a principled and scalable engine for deep model auditing,
FailureAtlas establishes a new, diagnostic-first methodology to guide the
development of more robust generative AI. The code is available at

*Youxu Shi,Suorong Yang,Dong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的自监督幻觉缓解方法，通过文本到图像模型将描述投影到视觉空间来放大幻觉信号，使用正负锚点编辑解码器隐藏状态，显著减少多模态大语言模型中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在各种视觉语言任务中取得了显著成功，但对幻觉问题高度敏感，即使在大模型中也会产生与视觉证据不一致的内容。现有方法通常需要额外微调、手工先验，或在信息量和可扩展性方面做出妥协。

Method: 提出训练免费的自监督幻觉缓解方法：通过文本到图像模型将描述投影到视觉空间来揭示隐含的幻觉信号作为负锚点，原始图像作为正锚点，利用这两个锚点编辑解码器隐藏状态，将表示拉向忠实语义并推离幻觉方向。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法在对象、属性和关系级别显著减少幻觉，同时很大程度上保持了召回率和描述丰富度。例如，在CHAIR上使用LLaVA-v1.5-7B实现了超过5%的幻觉减少。在LLaVA-NEXT-7B、Cambrian-8B和InstructBLIP-7B等不同架构上验证了强大的跨架构泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法无需人工先验或额外训练成本，确保有效性和效率。当应用于无幻觉描述时，几乎不会产生副作用，突显了其鲁棒性和实用的即插即用适用性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success
across diverse vision-language tasks, yet they remain highly susceptible to
hallucinations, producing content that is fluent but inconsistent with visual
evidence. Such hallucinations, spanning objects, attributes, and relations,
persist even in larger models, while existing mitigation approaches often
require additional finetuning, handcrafted priors, or trade-offs that
compromise informativeness and scalability. To address this limitation, we
propose a training-free, self-supervised method for hallucination mitigation.
Our approach introduces a novel hallucination amplification mechanism: a
caption is projected into the visual space via a text-to-image model to reveal
implicit hallucination signals, serving as a negative anchor, while the
original image provides a positive anchor. Leveraging these dual anchors, we
edit decoder hidden states by pulling representations toward faithful semantics
and pushing them away from hallucination directions. This correction requires
no human priors or additional training costs, ensuring both effectiveness and
efficiency. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that our
method significantly reduces hallucinations at the object, attribute, and
relation levels while largely preserving recall and caption richness, e.g.,
achieving a hallucination reduction by over 5% using LLaVA-v1.5-7B on CHAIR.
Furthermore, results on diverse architectures, including LLaVA-NEXT-7B,
Cambrian-8B, and InstructBLIP-7B, validate strong cross-architecture
generalization. More importantly, when applied to hallucination-free captions,
our method introduces almost no side effects, underscoring its robustness and
practical plug-and-play applicability. The implementation will be publicly
available.

TL;DR: 提出CoFFT方法，通过模拟人类视觉认知过程来增强视觉语言模型的推理能力，无需额外训练即可在多个基准测试中提升3.1-5.8%的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在处理复杂冗余的视觉输入时容易受到干扰，产生过多任务无关的推理过程甚至幻觉，无法在推理过程中精确发现和处理所需区域。

Method: CoFFT包含三个迭代阶段：多样样本生成、双重前瞻解码和视觉焦点调整，通过推理引导视觉焦点、视觉焦点指导后续推理的循环过程。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL、InternVL-2.5和Llava-Next等多个模型上的实验结果显示，性能一致提升3.1-5.8%，且计算开销可控增加。

Conclusion: CoFFT通过模拟人类视觉认知过程，有效提升了视觉语言模型的推理能力，解决了视觉输入复杂冗余导致的干扰问题。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs), they remain
constrained by the complexity and redundancy of visual input. When images
contain large amounts of irrelevant information, VLMs are susceptible to
interference, thus generating excessive task-irrelevant reasoning processes or
even hallucinations. This limitation stems from their inability to discover and
process the required regions during reasoning precisely. To address this
limitation, we present the Chain of Foresight-Focus Thought (CoFFT), a novel
training-free approach that enhances VLMs' visual reasoning by emulating human
visual cognition. Each Foresight-Focus Thought consists of three stages: (1)
Diverse Sample Generation: generates diverse reasoning samples to explore
potential reasoning paths, where each sample contains several reasoning steps;
(2) Dual Foresight Decoding: rigorously evaluates these samples based on both
visual focus and reasoning progression, adding the first step of optimal sample
to the reasoning process; (3) Visual Focus Adjustment: precisely adjust visual
focus toward regions most beneficial for future reasoning, before returning to
stage (1) to generate subsequent reasoning samples until reaching the final
answer. These stages function iteratively, creating an interdependent cycle
where reasoning guides visual focus and visual focus informs subsequent
reasoning. Empirical results across multiple benchmarks using Qwen2.5-VL,
InternVL-2.5, and Llava-Next demonstrate consistent performance improvements of
3.1-5.8\% with controllable increasing computational overhead.

Method: 构建了第一人称视角面对面教学视频数据集，并提供程序步骤分割和对话状态分类的标注。基准测试了多模态大语言模型与传统任务特定模型。

Result: 多模态大语言模型即使没有任务特定的微调，也优于专门的基线模型。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型在理解面对面教学场景方面显示出潜力，能够整合处理语言和非语言交流信息。

Abstract: Analyzing instructional interactions between an instructor and a learner who
are co-present in the same physical space is a critical problem for educational
support and skill transfer. Yet such face-to-face instructional scenes have not
been systematically studied in computer vision. We identify two key reasons: i)
the lack of suitable datasets and ii) limited analytical techniques. To address
this gap, we present a new egocentric video dataset of face-to-face instruction
and provide ground-truth annotations for two fundamental tasks that serve as a
first step toward a comprehensive understanding of instructional interactions:
procedural step segmentation and conversation-state classification. Using this
dataset, we benchmark multimodal large language models (MLLMs) against
conventional task-specific models. Since face-to-face instruction involves
multiple modalities (speech content and prosody, gaze and body motion, and
visual context), effective understanding requires methods that handle verbal
and nonverbal communication in an integrated manner. Accordingly, we evaluate
recently introduced MLLMs that jointly process images, audio, and text. This
evaluation quantifies the extent to which current machine learning models
understand face-to-face instructional scenes. In experiments, MLLMs outperform
specialized baselines even without task-specific fine-tuning, suggesting their
promise for holistic understanding of instructional interactions.

Motivation: GAN和扩散模型生成的伪造内容越来越逼真，现有方法仅关注空间或频域特征，限制了其对未见篡改的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 统一的空间-频谱学习对于鲁棒和可泛化的深度伪造检测具有显著效果。

Abstract: The increasing realism of content generated by GANs and diffusion models has
made deepfake detection significantly more challenging. Existing approaches
often focus solely on spatial or frequency-domain features, limiting their
generalization to unseen manipulations. We propose the Spectral
Cross-Attentional Network (SpecXNet), a dual-domain architecture for robust
deepfake detection. The core \textbf{Dual-Domain Feature Coupler (DDFC)}
decomposes features into a local spatial branch for capturing texture-level
anomalies and a global spectral branch that employs Fast Fourier Transform to
model periodic inconsistencies. This dual-domain formulation allows SpecXNet to
jointly exploit localized detail and global structural coherence, which are
critical for distinguishing authentic from manipulated images. We also
introduce the \textbf{Dual Fourier Attention (DFA)} module, which dynamically
fuses spatial and spectral features in a content-aware manner. Built atop a
modified XceptionNet backbone, we embed the DDFC and DFA modules within a
separable convolution block. Extensive experiments on multiple deepfake
benchmarks show that SpecXNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, particularly
under cross-dataset and unseen manipulation scenarios, while maintaining
real-time feasibility. Our results highlight the effectiveness of unified
spatial-spectral learning for robust and generalizable deepfake detection. To
ensure reproducibility, we released the full code on

Motivation: 现有3D重建模型无法生成材质属性，这在多样化光照环境下对真实感渲染至关重要。需要一种能够生成物理渲染(PBR)材质的方法。

Method: 首先微调基于深度和法线图的多视角材质扩散模型，然后利用生成的多视角PBR图像探索高斯材质表示，该表示与2D高斯泼溅对齐并建模PBR材质的每个通道。

Conclusion: MGM框架成功生成了高质量的PBR材质3D内容，支持动态重光照，为3D内容创建提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing demand for 3D assets across various industries necessitates
efficient and automated methods for 3D content creation. Leveraging 3D Gaussian
Splatting, recent large reconstruction models (LRMs) have demonstrated the
ability to efficiently achieve high-quality 3D rendering by integrating
multiview diffusion for generation and scalable transformers for
reconstruction. However, existing models fail to produce the material
properties of assets, which is crucial for realistic rendering in diverse
lighting environments. In this paper, we introduce the Large Material Gaussian
Model (MGM), a novel framework designed to generate high-quality 3D content
with Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials, ie, albedo, roughness, and
metallic properties, rather than merely producing RGB textures with
uncontrolled light baking. Specifically, we first fine-tune a new multiview
material diffusion model conditioned on input depth and normal maps. Utilizing
the generated multiview PBR images, we explore a Gaussian material
representation that not only aligns with 2D Gaussian Splatting but also models
each channel of the PBR materials. The reconstructed point clouds can then be
rendered to acquire PBR attributes, enabling dynamic relighting by applying
various ambient light maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
materials produced by our method not only exhibit greater visual appeal
compared to baseline methods but also enhance material modeling, thereby
enabling practical downstream rendering applications.

Abstract: Point cloud completion aims to reconstruct complete shapes from partial
observations. Although current methods have achieved remarkable performance,
they still have some limitations: Supervised methods heavily rely on ground
truth, which limits their generalization to real-world datasets due to the
synthetic-to-real domain gap. Unsupervised methods require complete point
clouds to compose unpaired training data, and weakly-supervised methods need
multi-view observations of the object. Existing self-supervised methods
frequently produce unsatisfactory predictions due to the limited capabilities
of their self-supervised signals. To overcome these challenges, we propose a
novel self-supervised point cloud completion method. We design a set of novel
self-supervised signals based on multi-view augmentations of the single partial
point cloud. Additionally, to enhance the model's learning ability, we first
incorporate Mamba into self-supervised point cloud completion task, encouraging
the model to generate point clouds with better quality. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Conditional image generation models have achieved remarkable results by
leveraging text-based control to generate customized images. However, the high
resource demands of these models and the scarcity of well-annotated data have
hindered their deployment on edge devices, leading to enormous costs and
privacy concerns, especially when user data is sent to a third party. To
overcome these challenges, we propose Refine-Control, a semi-supervised
distillation framework. Specifically, we improve the performance of the student
model by introducing a tri-level knowledge fusion loss to transfer different
levels of knowledge. To enhance generalization and alleviate dataset scarcity,
we introduce a semi-supervised distillation method utilizing both labeled and
unlabeled data. Our experiments reveal that Refine-Control achieves significant
reductions in computational cost and latency, while maintaining high-fidelity
generation capabilities and controllability, as quantified by comparative
metrics.

Abstract: Material node graphs are programs that generate the 2D channels of procedural
materials, including geometry such as roughness and displacement maps, and
reflectance such as albedo and conductivity maps. They are essential in
computer graphics for representing the appearance of virtual 3D objects
parametrically and at arbitrary resolution. In particular, their directed
acyclic graph structures and intermediate states provide an intuitive
understanding and workflow for interactive appearance modeling. Creating such
graphs is a challenging task and typically requires professional training.
While recent neural program synthesis approaches attempt to simplify this
process, they solely represent graphs as textual programs, failing to capture
the inherently visual-spatial nature of node graphs that makes them accessible
to humans. To address this gap, we present MultiMat, a multimodal program
synthesis framework that leverages large multimodal models to process both
visual and textual graph representations for improved generation of procedural
material graphs. We train our models on a new dataset of production-quality
procedural materials and combine them with a constrained tree search inference
algorithm that ensures syntactic validity while efficiently navigating the
program space. Our experimental results show that our multimodal program
synthesis method is more efficient in both unconditional and conditional graph
synthesis with higher visual quality and fidelity than text-only baselines,
establishing new state-of-the-art performance.

*Kirsten Odendaal,Neela Kaushik,Spencer Halverson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 结合StyleGAN、DragGAN和PCA来提升GAN生成图像的潜在空间效率和可控性，在AFHQ数据集上验证了该方法在保持性能的同时提高优化效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升GAN生成图像的潜在空间效率和可控性，实现更高效和可解释的图像编辑

Method: 将PCA降维与DragGAN图像操作框架结合，在StyleGAN的W+潜在层中引入PCA，并实现跨模型对齐

Result: PCA显著减少了总优化时间，同时保持良好视觉质量，在浅层潜在空间(W+层=3)中甚至提升了SSIM指标，成功实现了AFHQ-Dog和AFHQ-Cat模型的图像对齐和可控操作

Conclusion: 该方法为广泛的图像合成和编辑应用提供了高效且可解释的潜在空间控制可能性

Abstract: This work integrates StyleGAN, DragGAN and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
to enhance the latent space efficiency and controllability of GAN-generated
images. Style-GAN provides a structured latent space, DragGAN enables intuitive
image manipulation, and PCA reduces dimensionality and facilitates cross-model
alignment for more streamlined and interpretable exploration of latent spaces.
We apply our techniques to the Animal Faces High Quality (AFHQ) dataset, and
find that our approach of integrating PCA-based dimensionality reduction with
the Drag-GAN framework for image manipulation retains performance while
improving optimization efficiency. Notably, introducing PCA into the latent W+
layers of DragGAN can consistently reduce the total optimization time while
maintaining good visual quality and even boosting the Structural Similarity
Index Measure (SSIM) of the optimized image, particularly in shallower latent
spaces (W+ layers = 3). We also demonstrate capability for aligning images
generated by two StyleGAN models trained on similar but distinct data domains
(AFHQ-Dog and AFHQ-Cat), and show that we can control the latent space of these
aligned images to manipulate the images in an intuitive and interpretable
manner. Our findings highlight the possibility for efficient and interpretable
latent space control for a wide range of image synthesis and editing
applications.

TL;DR: MinerU2.5是一个12亿参数的文档解析视觉语言模型，采用粗到细的两阶段解析策略，在保持计算效率的同时实现了最先进的识别精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高分辨率文档解析中的计算效率问题，同时保持对密集文本、复杂公式和表格的细粒度细节识别能力。

Method: 采用两阶段解析策略：第一阶段在降采样图像上进行高效的布局分析，识别结构元素；第二阶段基于全局布局指导，在原始分辨率裁剪区域上进行针对性内容识别。

Result: 在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，超越了通用和领域特定模型，同时显著降低了计算开销。

Conclusion: MinerU2.5通过创新的两阶段解析策略和全面的数据引擎，在文档解析任务中实现了精度与效率的平衡，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce MinerU2.5, a 1.2B-parameter document parsing vision-language
model that achieves state-of-the-art recognition accuracy while maintaining
exceptional computational efficiency. Our approach employs a coarse-to-fine,
two-stage parsing strategy that decouples global layout analysis from local
content recognition. In the first stage, the model performs efficient layout
analysis on downsampled images to identify structural elements, circumventing
the computational overhead of processing high-resolution inputs. In the second
stage, guided by the global layout, it performs targeted content recognition on
native-resolution crops extracted from the original image, preserving
fine-grained details in dense text, complex formulas, and tables. To support
this strategy, we developed a comprehensive data engine that generates diverse,
large-scale training corpora for both pretraining and fine-tuning. Ultimately,
MinerU2.5 demonstrates strong document parsing ability, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, surpassing both
general-purpose and domain-specific models across various recognition tasks,
while maintaining significantly lower computational overhead.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Perceptually-Grounded Geospatial Chain-of-Thought (Geo-CoT)框架，通过两阶段对齐策略训练RSThinker模型，实现可验证的多步遥感分析推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视觉语言模型在遥感复杂分析任务中的局限性，这些模型因端到端训练而绕过关键推理步骤，产生不可验证的输出。

Method: 使用Geo-CoT380k数据集进行两阶段对齐：先通过监督微调建立基础认知架构，再通过组奖励策略优化来优化推理策略。

Result: RSThinker模型在广泛任务上显著优于最先进模型，能同时输出最终答案和可验证的分析轨迹。

Conclusion: Geo-CoT框架为地球观测从模糊感知向结构化、可验证推理提供了具体路径，相关数据集和模型将公开发布。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in remote sensing often fail at complex
analytical tasks, a limitation stemming from their end-to-end training paradigm
that bypasses crucial reasoning steps and leads to unverifiable outputs. To
address this limitation, we introduce the Perceptually-Grounded Geospatial
Chain-of-Thought (Geo-CoT), a framework that models remote sensing analysis as
a verifiable, multi-step process. We instill this analytical process through a
two-stage alignment strategy, leveraging Geo-CoT380k, the first large-scale
dataset of structured Geo-CoT rationales. This strategy first employs
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to instill the foundational cognitive
architecture, then leverages Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) to refine
the model's reasoning policy towards factual correctness. The resulting model,
RSThinker, outputs both a final answer and its justifying, verifiable
analytical trace. This capability yields dominant performance, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art models across a comprehensive range of tasks.
The public release of our Geo-CoT380k dataset and RSThinker model upon
publication serves as a concrete pathway from opaque perception towards
structured, verifiable reasoning for Earth Observation.

*Jiayu Ding,Xinpeng Liu,Zhiyi Pan,Shiqiang Long,Ge Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MUSplat是一个无需训练的开源框架，将2D开放词汇理解提升到3D高斯溅射场景，解决了现有方法依赖逐场景训练、单语义设计和跨视图语义不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主流方法存在三个关键缺陷：(i)依赖昂贵的逐场景重新训练，无法即插即用；(ii)限制性的单语义设计无法表示复杂的多概念语义；(iii)易受跨视图语义不一致影响，破坏最终语义表示。

Method: 利用预训练的2D分割模型生成并提升多粒度2D掩码到3D，为每个高斯点估计前景概率形成初始对象组。使用语义熵和几何不透明度优化模糊边界，通过视觉语言模型在最具代表性的视角下解释对象外观，提取鲁棒的文本特征。

Result: MUSplat将场景适应时间从数小时减少到几分钟，在开放词汇3D对象选择和语义分割基准任务上优于已建立的基于训练的框架，同时解决了它们的单语义限制。

Conclusion: 通过完全放弃特征优化和逐场景训练过程，MUSplat实现了高效、多语义的3D开放词汇理解，显著提升了性能和实用性。

Abstract: Lifting 2D open-vocabulary understanding into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
scenes is a critical challenge. However, mainstream methods suffer from three
key flaws: (i) their reliance on costly per-scene retraining prevents
plug-and-play application; (ii) their restrictive monosemous design fails to
represent complex, multi-concept semantics; and (iii) their vulnerability to
cross-view semantic inconsistencies corrupts the final semantic representation.
To overcome these limitations, we introduce MUSplat, a training-free framework
that abandons feature optimization entirely. Leveraging a pre-trained 2D
segmentation model, our pipeline generates and lifts multi-granularity 2D masks
into 3D, where we estimate a foreground probability for each Gaussian point to
form initial object groups. We then optimize the ambiguous boundaries of these
initial groups using semantic entropy and geometric opacity. Subsequently, by
interpreting the object's appearance across its most representative viewpoints,
a Vision-Language Model (VLM) distills robust textual features that reconciles
visual inconsistencies, enabling open-vocabulary querying via semantic
matching. By eliminating the costly per-scene training process, MUSplat reduces
scene adaptation time from hours to mere minutes. On benchmark tasks for
open-vocabulary 3D object selection and semantic segmentation, MUSplat
outperforms established training-based frameworks while simultaneously
addressing their monosemous limitations.

TL;DR: UrbanFeel是一个评估多模态大语言模型在城市发展理解和主观环境感知方面性能的综合性基准，包含14.3K个视觉问题，涵盖静态场景感知、时间变化理解和主观环境感知三个维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市发展影响全球一半以上人口，需要以人为中心理解其结构和感知变化。现有基准在探索MLLMs在城市环境中的表现方面有限，缺乏对时间演化和与人类感知一致的主观城市环境感知的系统探索。

Method: 收集全球11个代表性城市的多时间单视图和全景街景图像，通过空间聚类、基于规则的生成、模型辅助提示和人工标注的混合流程生成高质量问答对。

Result: 评估20个最先进的MLLMs，Gemini-2.5 Pro表现最佳，准确率接近人类专家水平，平均差距仅为1.5%。多数模型在场景理解任务上表现良好，部分模型在像素级变化检测上甚至超越人类标注者，但在需要时间推理的任务上表现下降。

Conclusion: UrbanFeel基准有效评估了MLLMs在城市发展理解方面的能力，揭示了模型在场景理解和主观感知方面的优势，以及在时间推理方面的局限性。

Abstract: Urban development impacts over half of the global population, making
human-centered understanding of its structural and perceptual changes essential
for sustainable development. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
have shown remarkable capabilities across various domains, existing benchmarks
that explore their performance in urban environments remain limited, lacking
systematic exploration of temporal evolution and subjective perception of urban
environment that aligns with human perception. To address these limitations, we
propose UrbanFeel, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
performance of MLLMs in urban development understanding and subjective
environmental perception. UrbanFeel comprises 14.3K carefully constructed
visual questions spanning three cognitively progressive dimensions: Static
Scene Perception, Temporal Change Understanding, and Subjective Environmental
Perception. We collect multi-temporal single-view and panoramic street-view
images from 11 representative cities worldwide, and generate high-quality
question-answer pairs through a hybrid pipeline of spatial clustering,
rule-based generation, model-assisted prompting, and manual annotation. Through
extensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we observe that Gemini-2.5
Pro achieves the best overall performance, with its accuracy approaching human
expert levels and narrowing the average gap to just 1.5\%. Most models perform
well on tasks grounded in scene understanding. In particular, some models even
surpass human annotators in pixel-level change detection. However, performance
drops notably in tasks requiring temporal reasoning over urban development.
Additionally, in the subjective perception dimension, several models reach
human-level or even higher consistency in evaluating dimension such as
beautiful and safety.

Motivation: 现有SFUDA方法要么仅利用源模型预测，要么微调大型多模态模型，但都忽略了互补见解和目标数据的潜在结构。

Method: EXCL包含双专家框架和检索增强交互优化管道。双专家框架将冻结的源域模型（带Conv-Adapter）和预训练视觉语言模型（带可训练文本提示）置于平等地位，从未标记目标样本中挖掘共识知识。RAIN优化管道包括协作检索伪源和复杂目标样本、分别微调各专家、通过共享学习结果强制学习对象一致性。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: EXCL方法有效解决了无源无监督域自适应问题，通过双专家协作和检索增强交互实现了高性能的域适应。

Abstract: Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA) addresses the realistic
challenge of adapting a source-trained model to a target domain without access
to the source data, driven by concerns over privacy and cost. Existing SFUDA
methods either exploit only the source model's predictions or fine-tune large
multimodal models, yet both neglect complementary insights and the latent
structure of target data. In this paper, we propose the Experts Cooperative
Learning (EXCL). EXCL contains the Dual Experts framework and
Retrieval-Augmentation-Interaction optimization pipeline. The Dual Experts
framework places a frozen source-domain model (augmented with Conv-Adapter) and
a pretrained vision-language model (with a trainable text prompt) on equal
footing to mine consensus knowledge from unlabeled target samples. To
effectively train these plug-in modules under purely unsupervised conditions,
we introduce Retrieval-Augmented-Interaction(RAIN), a three-stage pipeline that
(1) collaboratively retrieves pseudo-source and complex target samples, (2)
separately fine-tunes each expert on its respective sample set, and (3)
enforces learning object consistency via a shared learning result. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach matches
state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于扩散模型的文本引导图像编辑虽然质量出色，但计算延迟过高，阻碍了实际应用，需要开发实时高效的编辑方法。

Method: 1. 一步式反演编辑(OSIE)绕过昂贵的迭代过程；2. 背景保护(BG-Shield)技术选择性修改编辑区域特征；3. 稀疏空间交叉注意力(SSCA)机制抑制语义泄漏到背景。

Result: FlashEdit在保持优异背景一致性和结构完整性的同时，编辑时间低于0.2秒，相比传统多步方法实现了超过150倍的加速。

Conclusion: FlashEdit框架成功实现了高保真、实时的图像编辑，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-guided image editing with diffusion models has achieved remarkable
quality but suffers from prohibitive latency, hindering real-world
applications. We introduce FlashEdit, a novel framework designed to enable
high-fidelity, real-time image editing. Its efficiency stems from three key
innovations: (1) a One-Step Inversion-and-Editing (OSIE) pipeline that bypasses
costly iterative processes; (2) a Background Shield (BG-Shield) technique that
guarantees background preservation by selectively modifying features only
within the edit region; and (3) a Sparsified Spatial Cross-Attention (SSCA)
mechanism that ensures precise, localized edits by suppressing semantic leakage
to the background. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlashEdit maintains
superior background consistency and structural integrity, while performing
edits in under 0.2 seconds, which is an over 150$\times$ speedup compared to
prior multi-step methods. Our code will be made publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学基准主要关注分类准确性，导致模型看似熟练但实际在高风险诊断推理中失败，需要专门评估临床推理能力的基准。

Method: 开发混合评分流程，结合基于LLM的评分器、临床医生验证和语义相似性指标，系统评估GPT-4o、Claude-4和MedGemma等最先进VLM。

Result: 与传统数据集相比，模型性能显著下降，错误分析显示推理失败而非感知错误是主要问题。

Conclusion: 提出双轴评估框架：广度导向的大数据集用于统计泛化，深度导向的紧凑基准如Neural-MedBench用于推理保真度评估。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable
performance on standard medical benchmarks, yet their true clinical reasoning
ability remains unclear. Existing datasets predominantly emphasize
classification accuracy, creating an evaluation illusion in which models appear
proficient while still failing at high-stakes diagnostic reasoning. We
introduce Neural-MedBench, a compact yet reasoning-intensive benchmark
specifically designed to probe the limits of multimodal clinical reasoning in
neurology. Neural-MedBench integrates multi-sequence MRI scans, structured
electronic health records, and clinical notes, and encompasses three core task
families: differential diagnosis, lesion recognition, and rationale generation.
To ensure reliable evaluation, we develop a hybrid scoring pipeline that
combines LLM-based graders, clinician validation, and semantic similarity
metrics. Through systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art VLMs, including
GPT-4o, Claude-4, and MedGemma, we observe a sharp performance drop compared to
conventional datasets. Error analysis shows that reasoning failures, rather
than perceptual errors, dominate model shortcomings. Our findings highlight the
necessity of a Two-Axis Evaluation Framework: breadth-oriented large datasets
for statistical generalization, and depth-oriented, compact benchmarks such as
Neural-MedBench for reasoning fidelity. We release Neural-MedBench at
https://neuromedbench.github.io/ as an open and extensible diagnostic testbed,
which guides the expansion of future benchmarks and enables rigorous yet
cost-effective assessment of clinically trustworthy AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统大规模地图构建方法依赖昂贵的专用数据采集车辆和人工标注，效率低下。现有卫星方法虽然提高了效率和覆盖范围，但存在卫星数据固有缺陷（如遮挡、过时）以及感知方法向量化效率低导致道路不连续粗糙的问题。

Method: 提出UniMapGen框架：1）将车道线表示为离散序列，采用迭代策略生成更完整平滑的地图向量；2）支持BEV、PV和文本提示等多模态输入；3）开发状态更新策略确保全局连续性和一致性。

Conclusion: UniMapGen通过创新的生成式方法有效解决了大规模地图构建中的关键挑战，为自动驾驶和导航系统提供了更高效可靠的地图构建解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale map construction is foundational for critical applications such
as autonomous driving and navigation systems. Traditional large-scale map
construction approaches mainly rely on costly and inefficient special data
collection vehicles and labor-intensive annotation processes. While existing
satellite-based methods have demonstrated promising potential in enhancing the
efficiency and coverage of map construction, they exhibit two major
limitations: (1) inherent drawbacks of satellite data (e.g., occlusions,
outdatedness) and (2) inefficient vectorization from perception-based methods,
resulting in discontinuous and rough roads that require extensive
post-processing. This paper presents a novel generative framework, UniMapGen,
for large-scale map construction, offering three key innovations: (1)
representing lane lines as \textbf{discrete sequence} and establishing an
iterative strategy to generate more complete and smooth map vectors than
traditional perception-based methods. (2) proposing a flexible architecture
that supports \textbf{multi-modal} inputs, enabling dynamic selection among
BEV, PV, and text prompt, to overcome the drawbacks of satellite data. (3)
developing a \textbf{state update} strategy for global continuity and
consistency of the constructed large-scale map. UniMapGen achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the OpenSatMap dataset. Furthermore, UniMapGen
can infer occluded roads and predict roads missing from dataset annotations.
Our code will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常分别处理网格重建和材质分解任务，难以重建高反射表面，且依赖外部模型的先验知识来提升分解效果。

Method: 联合优化与渲染深度和法线质量相关的属性，提出基于多视角光度变化的新型粗糙度监督策略，结合精心设计的损失函数和优化过程。

Result: 该方法能够产生与最先进方法相媲美的重建结果，为下游任务提供三角形网格及其相关的材质组件。

Conclusion: GS-2M框架在广泛使用的数据集上验证了有效性，与最先进的表面重建方法相比具有竞争力。

Abstract: We propose a unified solution for mesh reconstruction and material
decomposition from multi-view images based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, referred
to as GS-2M. Previous works handle these tasks separately and struggle to
reconstruct highly reflective surfaces, often relying on priors from external
models to enhance the decomposition results. Conversely, our method addresses
these two problems by jointly optimizing attributes relevant to the quality of
rendered depth and normals, maintaining geometric details while being resilient
to reflective surfaces. Although contemporary works effectively solve these
tasks together, they often employ sophisticated neural components to learn
scene properties, which hinders their performance at scale. To further
eliminate these neural components, we propose a novel roughness supervision
strategy based on multi-view photometric variation. When combined with a
carefully designed loss and optimization process, our unified framework
produces reconstruction results comparable to state-of-the-art methods,
delivering triangle meshes and their associated material components for
downstream tasks. We validate the effectiveness of our approach with widely
used datasets from previous works and qualitative comparisons with
state-of-the-art surface reconstruction methods.

Motivation: 尽管强化学习在文档分析领域应用不广泛，但许多下游任务可能受益于强化学习的新兴特性，特别是增强的推理能力。

Method: 使用基于规则的强化学习方法，在文档图像分类任务上进行实验，考察三种不同的分布外场景。

Result: 强化学习在分布外数据上表现出更好的泛化能力，包括分布外图像、未见类别和不同模态三种场景。

Conclusion: 基于规则的强化学习在文档分析任务中具有潜力，特别是在处理分布外数据时表现出优越的泛化性能。

Abstract: Rule-based reinforcement learning has been gaining popularity ever since
DeepSeek-R1 has demonstrated its success through simple verifiable rewards. In
the domain of document analysis, reinforcement learning is not as prevalent,
even though many downstream tasks may benefit from the emerging properties of
reinforcement learning, particularly the enhanced reason capabilities. We study
the effects of rule-based reinforcement learning with the task of Document
Image Classification which is one of the most commonly studied downstream tasks
in document analysis. We find that reinforcement learning tends to have better
generalisation capabilities to out-of-distritbution data, which we examine in
three different scenarios, namely out-of-distribution images, unseen classes
and different modalities. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneSplit是一种针对文本到视频(T2V)模型的黑盒越狱攻击方法，通过将有害叙述分解为多个看似良性的场景，利用场景组合约束生成空间，从而绕过安全过滤器生成有害视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着T2V模型的快速发展，其安全风险日益凸显。虽然已有研究探索了LLMs、VLMs和T2I模型的漏洞，但T2V模型的安全性尚未得到充分研究，存在显著的安全空白。

Method: SceneSplit通过将有害叙述分解为多个单独良性的场景，利用场景组合约束生成空间，并采用迭代场景操作绕过安全过滤器，同时使用策略库重用成功攻击模式提高攻击效果。

Result: 在11个安全类别上对T2V模型进行评估，SceneSplit在Luma Ray2上达到77.2%的平均攻击成功率，在海螺模型上达到84.1%，在Veo2上达到78.2%，显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 当前T2V安全机制容易受到利用叙事结构攻击的影响，这项工作为理解和改进T2V模型安全性提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Along with the rapid advancement of numerous Text-to-Video (T2V) models,
growing concerns have emerged regarding their safety risks. While recent
studies have explored vulnerabilities in models like LLMs, VLMs, and
Text-to-Image (T2I) models through jailbreak attacks, T2V models remain largely
unexplored, leaving a significant safety gap. To address this gap, we introduce
SceneSplit, a novel black-box jailbreak method that works by fragmenting a
harmful narrative into multiple scenes, each individually benign. This approach
manipulates the generative output space, the abstract set of all potential
video outputs for a given prompt, using the combination of scenes as a powerful
constraint to guide the final outcome. While each scene individually
corresponds to a wide and safe space where most outcomes are benign, their
sequential combination collectively restricts this space, narrowing it to an
unsafe region and significantly increasing the likelihood of generating a
harmful video. This core mechanism is further enhanced through iterative scene
manipulation, which bypasses the safety filter within this constrained unsafe
region. Additionally, a strategy library that reuses successful attack patterns
further improves the attack's overall effectiveness and robustness. To validate
our method, we evaluate SceneSplit across 11 safety categories on T2V models.
Our results show that it achieves a high average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of
77.2% on Luma Ray2, 84.1% on Hailuo, and 78.2% on Veo2, significantly
outperforming the existing baseline. Through this work, we demonstrate that
current T2V safety mechanisms are vulnerable to attacks that exploit narrative
structure, providing new insights for understanding and improving the safety of
T2V models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于动量的采样技术HiGS，通过整合近期模型预测来提升扩散模型的采样质量和效率，无需额外训练或计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成中仍有输出不真实、缺乏细节的问题，特别是在使用较少神经网络评估次数或较低引导尺度时。

Method: HiGS利用当前预测与过去预测加权平均之间的差异来引导采样过程，向更真实、细节更丰富的输出方向优化。

Result: 实验表明HiGS在各种模型和架构下都能提升图像质量，使用SiT模型在ImageNet 256×256上仅用30步就达到了1.61的FID新纪录。

Conclusion: HiGS是一个即插即用的扩散采样增强方法，能够在更少步骤下实现更高保真度的图像生成。

Abstract: While diffusion models have made remarkable progress in image generation,
their outputs can still appear unrealistic and lack fine details, especially
when using fewer number of neural function evaluations (NFEs) or lower guidance
scales. To address this issue, we propose a novel momentum-based sampling
technique, termed history-guided sampling (HiGS), which enhances quality and
efficiency of diffusion sampling by integrating recent model predictions into
each inference step. Specifically, HiGS leverages the difference between the
current prediction and a weighted average of past predictions to steer the
sampling process toward more realistic outputs with better details and
structure. Our approach introduces practically no additional computation and
integrates seamlessly into existing diffusion frameworks, requiring neither
extra training nor fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that HiGS
consistently improves image quality across diverse models and architectures and
under varying sampling budgets and guidance scales. Moreover, using a
pretrained SiT model, HiGS achieves a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.61 for
unguided ImageNet generation at 256$\times$256 with only 30 sampling steps
(instead of the standard 250). We thus present HiGS as a plug-and-play
enhancement to standard diffusion sampling that enables faster generation with
higher fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VeloxSeg提出了一种轻量级3D医学图像分割方法，通过双流CNN-Transformer架构、配对窗口注意力和Johnson-Lindenstrauss引理指导的卷积，解决了效率与鲁棒性冲突问题，在保持低计算预算的同时显著提升分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轻量级3D医学图像分割面临"效率/鲁棒性冲突"的根本限制，特别是在处理复杂解剖结构和异构模态时。本文旨在基于高维3D图像特性重新设计框架，探索数据协同以克服轻量级方法的脆弱表示。

Method: VeloxSeg采用可部署和可扩展的双流CNN-Transformer架构，包含配对窗口注意力(PWA)和Johnson-Lindenstrauss引理指导的卷积(JLC)。通过"一瞥-聚焦"原则，PWA快速检索多尺度信息，JLC以最少参数确保鲁棒的局部特征提取。还包含模态交互扩展和基于Gram矩阵的空间解耦知识转移(SDKT)。

Result: 在多模态基准测试中，VeloxSeg实现了26%的Dice系数提升，同时GPU吞吐量提高11倍，CPU提高48倍。

Conclusion: VeloxSeg通过创新的双流架构和知识转移策略，有效解决了轻量级3D医学图像分割中的效率与鲁棒性平衡问题，在保持高效推理的同时显著提升了分割性能。

Abstract: Lightweight 3D medical image segmentation remains constrained by a
fundamental "efficiency / robustness conflict", particularly when processing
complex anatomical structures and heterogeneous modalities. In this paper, we
study how to redesign the framework based on the characteristics of
high-dimensional 3D images, and explore data synergy to overcome the fragile
representation of lightweight methods. Our approach, VeloxSeg, begins with a
deployable and extensible dual-stream CNN-Transformer architecture composed of
Paired Window Attention (PWA) and Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma-guided
convolution (JLC). For each 3D image, we invoke a "glance-and-focus" principle,
where PWA rapidly retrieves multi-scale information, and JLC ensures robust
local feature extraction with minimal parameters, significantly enhancing the
model's ability to operate with low computational budget. Followed by an
extension of the dual-stream architecture that incorporates modal interaction
into the multi-scale image-retrieval process, VeloxSeg efficiently models
heterogeneous modalities. Finally, Spatially Decoupled Knowledge Transfer
(SDKT) via Gram matrices injects the texture prior extracted by a
self-supervised network into the segmentation network, yielding stronger
representations than baselines at no extra inference cost. Experimental results
on multimodal benchmarks show that VeloxSeg achieves a 26% Dice improvement,
alongside increasing GPU throughput by 11x and CPU by 48x. Codes are available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAPID3是一个无需训练扩散变换器(DiT)的加速框架，通过三个轻量级策略头实现每张图像的自适应加速，采样速度提升近3倍且保持生成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DiT加速方法要么使用统一启发式策略牺牲质量，要么需要高成本的微调，需要一种零更新基础生成器的自适应加速方案

Method: 使用三个策略头(跳步、缓存重用、稀疏注意力)基于去噪状态独立决策，通过GRPO在线训练策略参数，同时使用对抗判别器增强奖励信号

Result: 在Stable Diffusion 3和FLUX等DiT骨干上实现近3倍采样加速，同时保持竞争力的生成质量

Conclusion: RAPID3框架成功实现了零更新基础生成器的自适应加速，为DiT的高效推理提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) excel at visual generation yet remain hampered
by slow sampling. Existing training-free accelerators - step reduction, feature
caching, and sparse attention - enhance inference speed but typically rely on a
uniform heuristic or a manually designed adaptive strategy for all images,
leaving quality on the table. Alternatively, dynamic neural networks offer
per-image adaptive acceleration, but their high fine-tuning costs limit broader
applicability. To address these limitations, we introduce RAPID3: Tri-Level
Reinforced Acceleration Policies for Diffusion Transformers, a framework that
delivers image-wise acceleration with zero updates to the base generator.
Specifically, three lightweight policy heads - Step-Skip, Cache-Reuse, and
Sparse-Attention - observe the current denoising state and independently decide
their corresponding speed-up at each timestep. All policy parameters are
trained online via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) while the
generator remains frozen. Meanwhile, an adversarially learned discriminator
augments the reward signal, discouraging reward hacking by boosting returns
only when generated samples stay close to the original model's distribution.
Across state-of-the-art DiT backbones, including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX,
RAPID3 achieves nearly 3x faster sampling with competitive generation quality.

Abstract: Current Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) algorithms typically focus on
mapping visual features to semantic labels or attempt to enhance learning by
fusing visual and attribute information. However, these methods fail to fully
exploit attribute knowledge and contextual information for more accurate
recognition. Although recent works have started to consider using attribute
text as additional input to enhance the association between visual and semantic
information, these methods are still in their infancy. To address the above
challenges, this paper proposes the construction of a multi-modal knowledge
graph, which is utilized to mine the relationships between local visual
features and text, as well as the relationships between attributes and
extensive visual context samples. Specifically, we propose an effective
multi-modal knowledge graph construction method that fully considers the
relationships among attributes and the relationships between attributes and
vision tokens. To effectively model these relationships, this paper introduces
a knowledge graph-guided cross-modal hypergraph learning framework to enhance
the standard pedestrian attribute recognition framework. Comprehensive
experiments on multiple PAR benchmark datasets have thoroughly demonstrated the
effectiveness of our proposed knowledge graph for the PAR task, establishing a
strong foundation for knowledge-guided pedestrian attribute recognition. The

Motivation: 工程设计需要从系统规范到组件实现的层次化抽象，涉及视觉理解和数学推理的结合。虽然多模态大语言模型在自然图像任务上表现出色，但从技术图表中提取数学模型的能力尚未被探索。

Method: 开发了包含8,006+问题的综合基准测试，涵盖从组件级原理图到系统级框图的电路理解层次。引入了层次化合成生成流水线，包括基于网格的原理图生成器和带有自动推导符号方程标签的框图生成器。

Result: 评估六个最先进的多模态大语言模型（包括闭源和开源模型）显示，在涉及组件识别和拓扑识别的感知任务上，闭源模型准确率超过85%，但在符号推导和分析推理任务上表现低于19%，揭示了视觉解析与符号推理之间的关键差距。

Conclusion: 具有更强符号推理能力的模型在设计任务上始终获得更高准确率，确认了数学理解在电路合成中的基础作用，并确立符号推理作为工程能力的关键指标。

Abstract: Engineering design operates through hierarchical abstraction from system
specifications to component implementations, requiring visual understanding
coupled with mathematical reasoning at each level. While Multi-modal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) excel at natural image tasks, their ability to extract
mathematical models from technical diagrams remains unexplored. We present
\textbf{CircuitSense}, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating circuit
understanding across this hierarchy through 8,006+ problems spanning
component-level schematics to system-level block diagrams. Our benchmark
uniquely examines the complete engineering workflow: Perception, Analysis, and
Design, with a particular emphasis on the critical but underexplored capability
of deriving symbolic equations from visual inputs. We introduce a hierarchical
synthetic generation pipeline consisting of a grid-based schematic generator
and a block diagram generator with auto-derived symbolic equation labels.
Comprehensive evaluation of six state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both
closed-source and open-source models, reveals fundamental limitations in
visual-to-mathematical reasoning. Closed-source models achieve over 85\%
accuracy on perception tasks involving component recognition and topology
identification, yet their performance on symbolic derivation and analytical
reasoning falls below 19\%, exposing a critical gap between visual parsing and
symbolic reasoning. Models with stronger symbolic reasoning capabilities
consistently achieve higher design task accuracy, confirming the fundamental
role of mathematical understanding in circuit synthesis and establishing
symbolic reasoning as the key metric for engineering competence.

Abstract: The real-time detection of small objects in complex scenes, such as the
unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photography captured by drones, has dual
challenges of detecting small targets (<32 pixels) and maintaining real-time
efficiency on resource-constrained platforms. While YOLO-series detectors have
achieved remarkable success in real-time large object detection, they suffer
from significantly higher false negative rates for drone-based detection where
small objects dominate, compared to large object scenarios. This paper proposes
HierLight-YOLO, a hierarchical feature fusion and lightweight model that
enhances the real-time detection of small objects, based on the YOLOv8
architecture. We propose the Hierarchical Extended Path Aggregation Network
(HEPAN), a multi-scale feature fusion method through hierarchical cross-level
connections, enhancing the small object detection accuracy. HierLight-YOLO
includes two innovative lightweight modules: Inverted Residual Depthwise
Convolution Block (IRDCB) and Lightweight Downsample (LDown) module, which
significantly reduce the model's parameters and computational complexity
without sacrificing detection capabilities. Small object detection head is
designed to further enhance spatial resolution and feature fusion to tackle the
tiny object (4 pixels) detection. Comparison experiments and ablation studies
on the VisDrone2019 benchmark demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of
HierLight-YOLO.

Motivation: 遮挡是当前视觉模型在解释复杂密集真实世界图像时面临的主要挑战，需要准确预测物体间的遮挡顺序关系。

Method: 通过向预训练的GPT-4模型提供专门设计的提示和输入图像，让其分析图像并生成顺序预测，然后解析响应构建遮挡矩阵。

Conclusion: 该模型能够以零样本方式推理遮挡关系，无需标注训练数据，可轻松集成到遮挡处理框架中。

Abstract: Occlusion remains a significant challenge for current vision models to
robustly interpret complex and dense real-world images and scenes. To address
this limitation and to enable accurate prediction of the occlusion order
relationship between objects, we propose leveraging the advanced capability of
a pre-trained GPT-4 model to deduce the order. By providing a specifically
designed prompt along with the input image, GPT-4 can analyze the image and
generate order predictions. The response can then be parsed to construct an
occlusion matrix which can be utilized in assisting with other occlusion
handling tasks and image understanding. We report the results of evaluating the
model on COCOA and InstaOrder datasets. The results show that by using semantic
context, visual patterns, and commonsense knowledge, the model can produce more
accurate order predictions. Unlike baseline methods, the model can reason about
occlusion relationships in a zero-shot fashion, which requires no annotated
training data and can easily be integrated into occlusion handling frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多聚焦图像融合方法难以保持清晰的聚焦-散焦边界，常常导致模糊过渡和聚焦细节丢失。

Method: 使用梯度域模型获得具有完整边界的初始融合结果，引入Tenengrad梯度检测提取显著特征，开发基于梯度和互补信息的聚焦度量来细化边界。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法在主观和客观评估中均优于12种最先进方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的基于显著边界增强的MFIF方法能够有效生成高质量融合边界，显著提升融合图像质量。

Abstract: Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) aims to yield an all-focused image from
multiple partially focused inputs, which is crucial in applications cover
sur-veillance, microscopy, and computational photography. However, existing
methods struggle to preserve sharp focus-defocus boundaries, often resulting in
blurred transitions and focused details loss. To solve this problem, we propose
a MFIF method based on significant boundary enhancement, which generates
high-quality fused boundaries while effectively detecting focus in-formation.
Particularly, we propose a gradient-domain-based model that can obtain initial
fusion results with complete boundaries and effectively pre-serve the boundary
details. Additionally, we introduce Tenengrad gradient detection to extract
salient features from both the source images and the ini-tial fused image,
generating the corresponding saliency maps. For boundary refinement, we develop
a focus metric based on gradient and complementary information, integrating the
salient features with the complementary infor-mation across images to emphasize
focused regions and produce a high-quality initial decision result. Extensive
experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms 12 state-of-the-art methods in both subjective and objective
evaluations. We have realized codes in https://github.com/Lihyua/GICI

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本对抗攻击方法主要针对静态场景，无法处理动态输出标签空间的问题。

Method: 使用基于聚类的代理模型训练方法，将动态输出转换为静态单输出场景，并提出最远标签目标攻击策略。

Result: 在4个数据集和8个受害者模型上评估，单次查询最大攻击成功率50.81%，静态场景最大ASR 82.68%，生成式任务也超越先前结果。

Conclusion: TDOA方法有效解决了动态输出场景的对抗攻击问题，对大型语言模型具有潜在威胁。

Abstract: Text adversarial attack methods are typically designed for static scenarios
with fixed numbers of output labels and a predefined label space, relying on
extensive querying of the victim model (query-based attacks) or the surrogate
model (transfer-based attacks). To address this gap, we introduce the Textual
Dynamic Outputs Attack (TDOA) method, which employs a clustering-based
surrogate model training approach to convert the dynamic-output scenario into a
static single-output scenario. To improve attack effectiveness, we propose the
farthest-label targeted attack strategy, which selects adversarial vectors that
deviate most from the model's coarse-grained labels, thereby maximizing
disruption. We extensively evaluate TDOA on four datasets and eight victim
models (e.g., ChatGPT-4o, ChatGPT-4.1), showing its effectiveness in crafting
adversarial examples and its strong potential to compromise large language
models with limited access. With a single query per text, TDOA achieves a
maximum attack success rate of 50.81\%. Additionally, we find that TDOA also
achieves state-of-the-art performance in conventional static output scenarios,
reaching a maximum ASR of 82.68\%. Meanwhile, by conceptualizing translation
tasks as classification problems with unbounded output spaces, we extend the
TDOA framework to generative settings, surpassing prior results by up to 0.64
RDBLEU and 0.62 RDchrF.

Conclusion: 尽管处于初步阶段，但神经符号方法具有足够通用性，可以适应并应用于其他医学语义分割任务。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in medical image analysis, aiding
medical decision-making by helping radiologists distinguish objects in an
image. Research in this field has been driven by deep learning applications,
which have the potential to scale these systems even in the presence of noise
and artifacts. However, these systems are not yet perfected. We argue that
performance can be improved by incorporating common medical knowledge into the
segmentation model's loss function. To this end, we introduce Logic Tensor
Networks (LTNs) to encode medical background knowledge using first-order logic
(FOL) rules. The encoded rules span from constraints on the shape of the
produced segmentation, to relationships between different segmented areas. We
apply LTNs in an end-to-end framework with a SwinUNETR for semantic
segmentation. We evaluate our method on the task of segmenting the hippocampus
in brain MRI scans. Our experiments show that LTNs improve the baseline
segmentation performance, especially when training data is scarce. Despite
being in its preliminary stages, we argue that neurosymbolic methods are
general enough to be adapted and applied to other medical semantic segmentation
tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法填补了自回归文本到图像生成中早期方法的安全空白，为视觉自回归模型提供了有效的概念擦除解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid progress of visual autoregressive (VAR) models has brought new
opportunities for text-to-image generation, but also heightened safety
concerns. Existing concept erasure techniques, primarily designed for diffusion
models, fail to generalize to VARs due to their next-scale token prediction
paradigm. In this paper, we first propose a novel VAR Erasure framework VARE
that enables stable concept erasure in VAR models by leveraging auxiliary
visual tokens to reduce fine-tuning intensity. Building upon this, we introduce
S-VARE, a novel and effective concept erasure method designed for VAR, which
incorporates a filtered cross entropy loss to precisely identify and minimally
adjust unsafe visual tokens, along with a preservation loss to maintain
semantic fidelity, addressing the issues such as language drift and reduced
diversity introduce by na\"ive fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach achieves surgical concept erasure while preserving generation
quality, thereby closing the safety gap in autoregressive text-to-image
generation by earlier methods.

Motivation: 医学影像的解剖理解对自动报告生成和手术导航至关重要，但专家标注数据稀缺。现有视觉语言模型在基于参考图像的理解和精细定位方面存在局限。

Method: 首先训练VLM通过参考图像和目标图像的相对空间关系识别解剖区域，然后结合SAM2的精细分割能力，实现小解剖区域(如血管段)的定位和像素级分割。

Result: 在两个分布内和两个分布外数据集上，RAU始终优于SAM2微调基准，提供更准确的分割和更可靠的定位，并展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: RAU是首个探索VLM在医学图像中基于参考的解剖结构识别、定位和分割能力的方法，其优异性能凸显了VLM驱动方法在临床工作流程中的潜力。

Abstract: Anatomical understanding through deep learning is critical for automatic
report generation, intra-operative navigation, and organ localization in
medical imaging; however, its progress is constrained by the scarcity of
expert-labeled data. A promising remedy is to leverage an annotated reference
image to guide the interpretation of an unlabeled target. Although recent
vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit non-trivial visual reasoning, their
reference-based understanding and fine-grained localization remain limited. We
introduce RAU, a framework for reference-based anatomical understanding with
VLMs. We first show that a VLM learns to identify anatomical regions through
relative spatial reasoning between reference and target images, trained on a
moderately sized dataset. We validate this capability through visual question
answering (VQA) and bounding box prediction. Next, we demonstrate that the
VLM-derived spatial cues can be seamlessly integrated with the fine-grained
segmentation capability of SAM2, enabling localization and pixel-level
segmentation of small anatomical regions, such as vessel segments. Across two
in-distribution and two out-of-distribution datasets, RAU consistently
outperforms a SAM2 fine-tuning baseline using the same memory setup, yielding
more accurate segmentations and more reliable localization. More importantly,
its strong generalization ability makes it scalable to out-of-distribution
datasets, a property crucial for medical image applications. To the best of our
knowledge, RAU is the first to explore the capability of VLMs for
reference-based identification, localization, and segmentation of anatomical
structures in medical images. Its promising performance highlights the
potential of VLM-driven approaches for anatomical understanding in automated
clinical workflows.

Motivation: 深度伪造检测器由于从有限训练数据中学习到的偏置，往往难以泛化到新的伪造类型。本文发现了一种新的频谱偏置，即检测器过度依赖特定频带，限制了其泛化能力。

Method: 提出FreqDebias框架：1) Fo-Mixup增强，动态多样化训练样本的频率特征；2) 双一致性正则化，通过类激活图实现局部一致性和通过冯·米塞斯-费希尔分布实现全局一致性。

Result: 大量实验表明，FreqDebias显著增强了跨域泛化能力，在跨域和域内设置下均优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: FreqDebias通过缓解频谱偏置，有效提升了深度伪造检测器的泛化性能，为处理未见伪造类型提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deepfake detectors often struggle to generalize to novel forgery types due to
biases learned from limited training data. In this paper, we identify a new
type of model bias in the frequency domain, termed spectral bias, where
detectors overly rely on specific frequency bands, restricting their ability to
generalize across unseen forgeries. To address this, we propose FreqDebias, a
frequency debiasing framework that mitigates spectral bias through two
complementary strategies. First, we introduce a novel Forgery Mixup (Fo-Mixup)
augmentation, which dynamically diversifies frequency characteristics of
training samples. Second, we incorporate a dual consistency regularization
(CR), which enforces both local consistency using class activation maps (CAMs)
and global consistency through a von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution on a
hyperspherical embedding space. This dual CR mitigates over-reliance on certain
frequency components by promoting consistent representation learning under both
local and global supervision. Extensive experiments show that FreqDebias
significantly enhances cross-domain generalization and outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both cross-domain and in-domain settings.

*Song Fei,Tian Ye,Lujia Wang,Lei Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LucidFlux是一个无需图像描述的通用图像修复框架，通过适配大型扩散变换器(Flux.1)实现，引入轻量级双分支条件器来注入退化输入和轻微修复代理的信号，设计时间步和层自适应调制策略来保护全局结构同时恢复纹理，并通过SigLIP特征实现无描述语义对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决通用图像修复中判别性修复器和UNet扩散先验在未知混合退化条件下容易过度平滑、产生幻觉或漂移的问题，同时避免依赖图像描述带来的延迟和不稳定性。

Method: 使用轻量级双分支条件器注入退化输入和修复代理信号；设计时间步和层自适应调制策略进行分层路由；通过SigLIP特征实现无描述语义对齐；采用可扩展的数据筛选流程进行结构丰富的监督。

Result: 在合成和真实世界基准测试中，LucidFlux始终优于强大的开源和商业基线方法，消融研究验证了每个组件的必要性。

Conclusion: 对于大型扩散变换器，何时、何地以及如何施加条件——而不是增加参数或依赖文本提示——是实现鲁棒且无需描述的通用图像修复的关键杠杆。

Abstract: Universal image restoration (UIR) aims to recover images degraded by unknown
mixtures while preserving semantics -- conditions under which discriminative
restorers and UNet-based diffusion priors often oversmooth, hallucinate, or
drift. We present LucidFlux, a caption-free UIR framework that adapts a large
diffusion transformer (Flux.1) without image captions. LucidFlux introduces a
lightweight dual-branch conditioner that injects signals from the degraded
input and a lightly restored proxy to respectively anchor geometry and suppress
artifacts. Then, a timestep- and layer-adaptive modulation schedule is designed
to route these cues across the backbone's hierarchy, in order to yield
coarse-to-fine and context-aware updates that protect the global structure
while recovering texture. After that, to avoid the latency and instability of
text prompts or MLLM captions, we enforce caption-free semantic alignment via
SigLIP features extracted from the proxy. A scalable curation pipeline further
filters large-scale data for structure-rich supervision. Across synthetic and
in-the-wild benchmarks, LucidFlux consistently outperforms strong open-source
and commercial baselines, and ablation studies verify the necessity of each
component. LucidFlux shows that, for large DiTs, when, where, and what to
condition on -- rather than adding parameters or relying on text prompts -- is
the governing lever for robust and caption-free universal image restoration in
the wild.

*Jiawei Liang,Ruoyu Chen,Xianghao Jiao,Siyuan Liang,Shiming Liu,Qunli Zhang,Zheng Hu,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MSEA和ARC方法，通过多尺度解释聚合和激活排名相关性来增强多模态大语言模型的可解释性，解决现有方法忽略模态内依赖性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可解释性研究主要关注跨模态归因，但忽略了模态内依赖性。视觉模态中孤立图像块归因缺乏空间上下文，文本模态中依赖前文标记引入虚假激活，这些干扰降低了归因保真度。

Method: 视觉分支：提出多尺度解释聚合(MSEA)，通过多尺度输入聚合归因来动态调整感受野；文本分支：提出激活排名相关性(ARC)，通过top-k预测排名对齐来衡量上下文标记的相关性，抑制无关上下文的虚假激活。

Result: 在多个先进MLLMs和基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法始终优于现有可解释性方法，产生更忠实和细粒度的模型行为解释。

Conclusion: 通过利用模态内交互增强可解释性，提出的MSEA和ARC方法能够有效解决现有方法的局限性，提供更全面和空间一致的视觉解释，同时抑制文本模态中的虚假激活。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success
across diverse vision-language tasks, yet their internal decision-making
mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. Existing interpretability research
has primarily focused on cross-modal attribution, identifying which image
regions the model attends to during output generation. However, these
approaches often overlook intra-modal dependencies. In the visual modality,
attributing importance to isolated image patches ignores spatial context due to
limited receptive fields, resulting in fragmented and noisy explanations. In
the textual modality, reliance on preceding tokens introduces spurious
activations. Failing to effectively mitigate these interference compromises
attribution fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose enhancing
interpretability by leveraging intra-modal interaction. For the visual branch,
we introduce \textit{Multi-Scale Explanation Aggregation} (MSEA), which
aggregates attributions over multi-scale inputs to dynamically adjust receptive
fields, producing more holistic and spatially coherent visual explanations. For
the textual branch, we propose \textit{Activation Ranking Correlation} (ARC),
which measures the relevance of contextual tokens to the current token via
alignment of their top-$k$ prediction rankings. ARC leverages this relevance to
suppress spurious activations from irrelevant contexts while preserving
semantically coherent ones. Extensive experiments across state-of-the-art MLLMs
and benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
existing interpretability methods, yielding more faithful and fine-grained
explanations of model behavior.

TL;DR: 提出U-MAN架构，通过渐进注意力引导特征融合和多尺度自适应KAN模块，解决医学图像分割中细节丢失和边界模糊问题，在多个数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统U-Net架构存在两个主要限制：(1)简单跳跃连接忽略了编码器-解码器之间的语义差距；(2)深层缺乏多尺度特征提取能力，导致医学图像分割中细粒度细节和精确边界难以保持。

Method: 提出U-MAN架构，包含两个核心模块：渐进注意力引导特征融合(PAGF)模块替代简单跳跃连接，使用注意力机制融合编码器和解码器特征；多尺度自适应KAN(MAN)模块使网络能够自适应处理多尺度特征。

Result: 在三个公开数据集(BUSI、GLAS和CVC)上的实验表明，U-MAN优于最先进方法，特别是在定义准确边界和保留精细细节方面表现突出。

Conclusion: U-MAN通过结合注意力机制和多尺度自适应KAN，有效解决了医学图像分割中的关键挑战，为复杂解剖结构和病理区域的精确分割提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation faces significant challenges in preserving
fine-grained details and precise boundaries due to complex anatomical
structures and pathological regions. These challenges primarily stem from two
key limitations of conventional U-Net architectures: (1) their simple skip
connections ignore the encoder-decoder semantic gap between various features,
and (2) they lack the capability for multi-scale feature extraction in deep
layers. To address these challenges, we propose the U-Net with Multi-scale
Adaptive KAN (U-MAN), a novel architecture that enhances the emerging
Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) with two specialized modules: Progressive
Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (PAGF) and the Multi-scale Adaptive KAN (MAN).
Our PAGF module replaces the simple skip connection, using attention to fuse
features from the encoder and decoder. The MAN module enables the network to
adaptively process features at multiple scales, improving its ability to
segment objects of various sizes. Experiments on three public datasets (BUSI,
GLAS, and CVC) show that U-MAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
particularly in defining accurate boundaries and preserving fine details.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模式识别模型使用为人类感知设计的预处理数据（如RGB图像、标准化浮点传感器数据），但在自动化分析场景中这种预处理可能不是最优的，且数据量大导致传输效率低、能耗高。

Method: 针对低比特深度捕获的传感器数据，提出γ-Quant方法，学习任务特定的非线性量化函数，应用于原始图像目标检测和可穿戴设备的人类活动识别。

Result: 实验表明，使用可学习量化的4位原始数据在性能上可与12位原始数据相媲美。

Conclusion: 在低带宽和能源受限环境下，通过任务特定的非线性量化方法，能够显著减少数据位深度而不损失识别性能，为边缘设备应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Most pattern recognition models are developed on pre-proce\-ssed data. In
computer vision, for instance, RGB images processed through image signal
processing (ISP) pipelines designed to cater to human perception are the most
frequent input to image analysis networks. However, many modern vision tasks
operate without a human in the loop, raising the question of whether such
pre-processing is optimal for automated analysis. Similarly, human activity
recognition (HAR) on body-worn sensor data commonly takes normalized
floating-point data arising from a high-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC)
as an input, despite such an approach being highly inefficient in terms of data
transmission, significantly affecting the battery life of wearable devices. In
this work, we target low-bandwidth and energy-constrained settings where
sensors are limited to low-bit-depth capture. We propose $\gamma$-Quant,
i.e.~the task-specific learning of a non-linear quantization for pattern
recognition. We exemplify our approach on raw-image object detection as well as
HAR of wearable data, and demonstrate that raw data with a learnable
quantization using as few as 4-bits can perform on par with the use of raw
12-bit data. All code to reproduce our experiments is publicly available via

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统可见光-红外图像融合方法只关注融合图像质量，而应用导向方法需要下游任务标注数据，数据获取成本高。

Method: 利用特征级融合分割和像素级融合分割之间的一致性，提出跨分割一致性自监督任务，设计两阶段训练策略和动态权重调整方法。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验表明，SSVIF仅使用未标注的可见光-红外图像对训练，就能超越传统VIF方法，与有监督的分割导向方法相媲美。

Conclusion: 提出的自监督框架有效解决了分割导向VIF方法对标注数据的依赖问题，为应用导向图像融合提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) has gained significant attention in
recent years due to its wide application in tasks such as scene segmentation
and object detection. VIF methods can be broadly classified into traditional
VIF methods and application-oriented VIF methods. Traditional methods focus
solely on improving the quality of fused images, while application-oriented VIF
methods additionally consider the performance of downstream tasks on fused
images by introducing task-specific loss terms during training. However,
compared to traditional methods, application-oriented VIF methods require
datasets labeled for downstream tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation or object
detection), making data acquisition labor-intensive and time-consuming. To
address this issue, we propose a self-supervised training framework for
segmentation-oriented VIF methods (SSVIF). Leveraging the consistency between
feature-level fusion-based segmentation and pixel-level fusion-based
segmentation, we introduce a novel self-supervised task-cross-segmentation
consistency-that enables the fusion model to learn high-level semantic features
without the supervision of segmentation labels. Additionally, we design a
two-stage training strategy and a dynamic weight adjustment method for
effective joint learning within our self-supervised framework. Extensive
experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
SSVIF. Remarkably, although trained only on unlabeled visible-infrared image
pairs, our SSVIF outperforms traditional VIF methods and rivals supervised
segmentation-oriented ones. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学图像跨模态训练中存在的领域差距问题，现有GAN方法在高度可变区域难以捕捉跨域映射。

Method: 首先使用Bézier曲线风格迁移减少领域差距，训练分割模型生成伪标签；然后训练条件扩散模型合成高质量目标域图像，并开发不确定性引导的分数匹配方法处理噪声伪标签。

Result: 在公共数据集上实验表明，该方法能生成逼真的标注图像，显著增强目标域数据并提升分割性能。

Conclusion: Bézier Meets Diffusion框架有效解决了医学图像跨域适应问题，通过风格迁移和扩散模型生成高质量数据，提升了分割模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Training robust learning algorithms across different medical imaging
modalities is challenging due to the large domain gap. Unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) mitigates this problem by using annotated images from the
source domain and unlabeled images from the target domain to train the deep
models. Existing approaches often rely on GAN-based style transfer, but these
methods struggle to capture cross-domain mappings in regions with high
variability. In this paper, we propose a unified framework, B\'ezier Meets
Diffusion, for cross-domain image generation. First, we introduce a
B\'ezier-curve-based style transfer strategy that effectively reduces the
domain gap between source and target domains. The transferred source images
enable the training of a more robust segmentation model across domains.
Thereafter, using pseudo-labels generated by this segmentation model on the
target domain, we train a conditional diffusion model (CDM) to synthesize
high-quality, labeled target-domain images. To mitigate the impact of noisy
pseudo-labels, we further develop an uncertainty-guided score matching method
that improves the robustness of CDM training. Extensive experiments on public
datasets demonstrate that our approach generates realistic labeled images,
significantly augmenting the target domain and improving segmentation
performance.

### [140] [PSTTS: A Plug-and-Play Token Selector for Efficient Event-based Spatio-temporal Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22481)
*Xiangmo Zhao,Nan Yang,Yang Wang,Zhanwen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PSTTS模块，通过空间令牌净化和时间令牌选择两个阶段，有效识别和丢弃事件数据中的时空冗余令牌，在保持精度的同时显著提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于事件帧序列的方法忽略了事件帧的高空间稀疏性和帧间运动冗余，导致计算开销大；现有的RGB视频令牌稀疏化方法依赖不可靠的中间令牌表示且忽略事件噪声影响，不适用于事件数据。

Method: PSTTS包含两个阶段：1) 空间令牌净化 - 通过评估事件帧内事件的时空一致性来丢弃噪声和非事件区域；2) 时间令牌选择 - 评估相邻事件帧间运动模式的相似性，精确识别和移除冗余时间信息。

Result: 在HARDVS、DailyDVS-200和SeACT数据集上测试，PSTTS显著提升效率：在DailyDVS-200数据集上减少FLOPs 29-43.6%，提升FPS 21.6-41.3%，同时保持任务精度。

Conclusion: PSTTS是一个无需额外参数的即插即用模块，能够有效利用事件数据的时空分布特性，在精度和效率之间实现最优平衡。

Abstract: Mainstream event-based spatio-temporal representation learning methods
typically process event streams by converting them into sequences of event
frames, achieving remarkable performance. However, they neglect the high
spatial sparsity and inter-frame motion redundancy inherent in event frame
sequences, leading to significant computational overhead. Existing token
sparsification methods for RGB videos rely on unreliable intermediate token
representations and neglect the influence of event noise, making them
ineffective for direct application to event data. In this paper, we propose
Progressive Spatio-Temporal Token Selection (PSTTS), a Plug-and-Play module for
event data without introducing any additional parameters. PSTTS exploits the
spatio-temporal distribution characteristics embedded in raw event data to
effectively identify and discard spatio-temporal redundant tokens, achieving an
optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, PSTTS consists
of two stages, Spatial Token Purification and Temporal Token Selection. Spatial
Token Purification discards noise and non-event regions by assessing the
spatio-temporal consistency of events within each event frame to prevent
interference with subsequent temporal redundancy evaluation. Temporal Token
Selection evaluates the motion pattern similarity between adjacent event
frames, precisely identifying and removing redundant temporal information. We
apply PSTTS to four representative backbones UniformerV2, VideoSwin, EVMamba,
and ExACT on the HARDVS, DailyDVS-200, and SeACT datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that PSTTS achieves significant efficiency improvements.
Specifically, PSTTS reduces FLOPs by 29-43.6% and increases FPS by 21.6-41.3%
on the DailyDVS-200 dataset, while maintaining task accuracy. Our code will be
available.

TL;DR: 提出了GCPO方法，通过识别关键图像token进行策略优化，仅使用30%的token就能达到比全token优化更好的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对所有图像token进行均匀优化，但不同token对RLVR训练的贡献不同，需要识别关键token并进行有效优化

Method: 从因果依赖、熵诱导空间结构和RLVR焦点token多样性三个角度识别关键token，并引入动态token-wise优势权重来鼓励探索

Result: 在多个文本到图像基准测试中，GCPO在AR模型和统一多模态模型上都表现出有效性，仅使用30%的token就能超越全token优化的性能

Conclusion: GCPO通过有效识别和优化关键token，为基于RLVR的自回归视觉生成提供了更高效的训练方法

Abstract: Recent studies have extended Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) to autoregressive (AR) visual generation and achieved promising
progress. However, existing methods typically apply uniform optimization across
all image tokens, while the varying contributions of different image tokens for
RLVR's training remain unexplored. In fact, the key obstacle lies in how to
identify more critical image tokens during AR generation and implement
effective token-wise optimization for them. To tackle this challenge, we
propose $\textbf{G}$roup $\textbf{C}$ritical-token $\textbf{P}$olicy
$\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{GCPO}$), which facilitates effective policy
optimization on critical tokens. We identify the critical tokens in RLVR-based
AR generation from three perspectives, specifically: $\textbf{(1)}$ Causal
dependency: early tokens fundamentally determine the later tokens and final
image effect due to unidirectional dependency; $\textbf{(2)}$ Entropy-induced
spatial structure: tokens with high entropy gradients correspond to image
structure and bridges distinct visual regions; $\textbf{(3)}$ RLVR-focused
token diversity: tokens with low visual similarity across a group of sampled
images contribute to richer token-level diversity. For these identified
critical tokens, we further introduce a dynamic token-wise advantage weight to
encourage exploration, based on confidence divergence between the policy model
and reference model. By leveraging 30\% of the image tokens, GCPO achieves
better performance than GRPO with full tokens. Extensive experiments on
multiple text-to-image benchmarks for both AR models and unified multimodal
models demonstrate the effectiveness of GCPO for AR visual generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉输入与自然语言输出对齐方面表现出色，但生成的token对视觉模态的依赖程度尚不明确，这限制了模型的可解释性和可靠性。

Method: EAGLE引入了一个统一充分性（洞察分数）和必要性（必要分数）的目标函数，通过贪心搜索在稀疏化图像区域上进行优化，实现忠实且高效的归因。

Conclusion: EAGLE通过提供细粒度的模型决策可解释性，有效推进了多模态大语言模型的可解释性研究，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in aligning visual inputs with natural language outputs. Yet, the
extent to which generated tokens depend on visual modalities remains poorly
understood, limiting interpretability and reliability. In this work, we present
EAGLE, a lightweight black-box framework for explaining autoregressive token
generation in MLLMs. EAGLE attributes any selected tokens to compact perceptual
regions while quantifying the relative influence of language priors and
perceptual evidence. The framework introduces an objective function that
unifies sufficiency (insight score) and indispensability (necessity score),
optimized via greedy search over sparsified image regions for faithful and
efficient attribution. Beyond spatial attribution, EAGLE performs
modality-aware analysis that disentangles what tokens rely on, providing
fine-grained interpretability of model decisions. Extensive experiments across
open-source MLLMs show that EAGLE consistently outperforms existing methods in
faithfulness, localization, and hallucination diagnosis, while requiring
substantially less GPU memory. These results highlight its effectiveness and
practicality for advancing the interpretability of MLLMs. The code is available

Motivation: 颜色是人类视觉感知的基本维度，随着视觉语言模型的普及，理解它们是否像人类一样命名颜色对于有效的人机交互至关重要。

Method: 使用957个颜色样本对五个代表性模型进行系统评估，复制经典颜色命名方法，并进行跨语言分析和消融研究。

Result: 模型在原型颜色上准确率高，但在扩展的非原型颜色集上性能显著下降；识别出21个常用颜色术语；发现训练数据严重偏向英语和中文；语言模型架构独立影响颜色命名。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型在颜色命名上存在局限性，特别是在非原型颜色和跨语言场景中，语言模型架构对颜色命名有显著影响。

Abstract: Color serves as a fundamental dimension of human visual perception and a
primary means of communicating about objects and scenes. As vision-language
models (VLMs) become increasingly prevalent, understanding whether they name
colors like humans is crucial for effective human-AI interaction. We present
the first systematic evaluation of color naming capabilities across VLMs,
replicating classic color naming methodologies using 957 color samples across
five representative models. Our results show that while VLMs achieve high
accuracy on prototypical colors from classical studies, performance drops
significantly on expanded, non-prototypical color sets. We identify 21 common
color terms that consistently emerge across all models, revealing two distinct
approaches: constrained models using predominantly basic terms versus expansive
models employing systematic lightness modifiers. Cross-linguistic analysis
across nine languages demonstrates severe training imbalances favoring English
and Chinese, with hue serving as the primary driver of color naming decisions.
Finally, ablation studies reveal that language model architecture significantly
influences color naming independent of visual processing capabilities.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) plays a pivotal role in various computer
vision applications, such as robotics, augmented reality, and autonomous
driving. Despite recent advancements, existing methods often fail to meet key
requirements for 3D reconstruction and view synthesis, including geometric
consistency, fine details, robustness to real-world challenges like reflective
surfaces, and efficiency for edge devices. To address these challenges, we
introduce a novel MDE system, called EfficientDepth, which combines a
transformer architecture with a lightweight convolutional decoder, as well as a
bimodal density head that allows the network to estimate detailed depth maps.
We train our model on a combination of labeled synthetic and real images, as
well as pseudo-labeled real images, generated using a high-performing MDE
method. Furthermore, we employ a multi-stage optimization strategy to improve
training efficiency and produce models that emphasize geometric consistency and
fine detail. Finally, in addition to commonly used objectives, we introduce a
loss function based on LPIPS to encourage the network to produce detailed depth
maps. Experimental results demonstrate that EfficientDepth achieves performance
comparable to or better than existing state-of-the-art models, with
significantly reduced computational resources.

Abstract: Category discovery (CD) is an emerging open-world learning task, which aims
at automatically categorizing unlabelled data containing instances from unseen
classes, given some labelled data from seen classes. This task has attracted
significant attention over the years and leads to a rich body of literature
trying to address the problem from different perspectives. In this survey, we
provide a comprehensive review of the literature, and offer detailed analysis
and in-depth discussion on different methods. Firstly, we introduce a taxonomy
for the literature by considering two base settings, namely novel category
discovery (NCD) and generalized category discovery (GCD), and several derived
settings that are designed to address the extra challenges in different
real-world application scenarios, including continual category discovery,
skewed data distribution, federated category discovery, etc. Secondly, for each
setting, we offer a detailed analysis of the methods encompassing three
fundamental components, representation learning, label assignment, and
estimation of class number. Thirdly, we benchmark all the methods and distill
key insights showing that large-scale pretrained backbones, hierarchical and
auxiliary cues, and curriculum-style training are all beneficial for category
discovery, while challenges remain in the design of label assignment, the
estimation of class numbers, and scaling to complex multi-object
scenarios.Finally, we discuss the key insights from the literature so far and
point out promising future research directions. We compile a living survey of

*Mohammad Mahdi Hemmatyar,Mahdi Jafari,Mohammad Amin Yousefi,Mohammad Reza Nemati,Mobin Azadani,Hamid Reza Rastad,Amirmohammad Akbari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyCoVAD是一个混合自监督学习-大语言模型方法，用于检测复杂视频异常，结合了SSL的时间分析能力和LLM的语义推理能力，在ComplexVAD数据集上取得72.5%的帧级AUC，优于现有基线12.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂视频异常检测的挑战，这类异常由多个实体间的复杂关系和时序依赖定义，而非孤立动作。现有SSL方法难以理解交互的语义含义，而LLM虽然推理能力强但计算昂贵且缺乏细粒度空间定位。

Method: 提出HyCoVAD混合模型：1）基于nnFormer的多任务SSL时序分析器，通过多个代理任务从视频帧中识别可疑异常帧；2）LLM验证器，对选定的帧应用结构化、基于规则的推理来验证异常存在。

Result: 在ComplexVAD数据集上，HyCoVAD达到72.5%的帧级AUC，比现有基线提升12.5%，同时减少了LLM计算量。

Conclusion: HyCoVAD有效结合了SSL和LLM的优势，为复杂视频异常检测提供了高效解决方案，并发布了交互异常分类法、自适应阈值协议和代码以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for intelligent surveillance, but a
significant challenge lies in identifying complex anomalies, which are events
defined by intricate relationships and temporal dependencies among multiple
entities rather than by isolated actions. While self-supervised learning (SSL)
methods effectively model low-level spatiotemporal patterns, they often
struggle to grasp the semantic meaning of these interactions. Conversely, large
language models (LLMs) offer powerful contextual reasoning but are
computationally expensive for frame-by-frame analysis and lack fine-grained
spatial localization. We introduce HyCoVAD, Hybrid Complex Video Anomaly
Detection, a hybrid SSL-LLM model that combines a multi-task SSL temporal
analyzer with LLM validator. The SSL module is built upon an nnFormer backbone
which is a transformer-based model for image segmentation. It is trained with
multiple proxy tasks, learns from video frames to identify those suspected of
anomaly. The selected frames are then forwarded to the LLM, which enriches the
analysis with semantic context by applying structured, rule-based reasoning to
validate the presence of anomalies. Experiments on the challenging ComplexVAD
dataset show that HyCoVAD achieves a 72.5% frame-level AUC, outperforming
existing baselines by 12.5% while reducing LLM computation. We release our
interaction anomaly taxonomy, adaptive thresholding protocol, and code to
facilitate future research in complex VAD scenarios.

*Jini Yang,Beomseok Oh,Seungryong Kim,Sunok Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpikeMatch是首个针对脉冲神经网络(SNN)的半监督学习框架，利用SNN的时间动态特性进行多样化伪标签生成，在有限标签下实现高效学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脉冲神经网络具有生物合理性和能效优势，但其半监督学习方法相比人工神经网络仍较少被探索，需要开发专门针对SNN特性的SSL框架。

Method: 基于协同训练框架，利用SNN泄漏因子的时间动态特性，通过单个SNN的多个预测一致性生成可靠伪标签，使用弱增强未标记样本生成伪标签来训练强增强样本。

Result: 实验表明SpikeMatch在各种标准基准测试中优于现有适应SNN骨干网络的SSL方法。

Conclusion: SpikeMatch成功展示了利用SNN时间动态特性进行半监督学习的有效性，为SNN的SSL研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently been attracting significant
attention for their biological plausibility and energy efficiency, but
semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods for SNN-based models remain
underexplored compared to those for artificial neural networks (ANNs). In this
paper, we introduce SpikeMatch, the first SSL framework for SNNs that leverages
the temporal dynamics through the leakage factor of SNNs for diverse
pseudo-labeling within a co-training framework. By utilizing agreement among
multiple predictions from a single SNN, SpikeMatch generates reliable
pseudo-labels from weakly-augmented unlabeled samples to train on
strongly-augmented ones, effectively mitigating confirmation bias by capturing
discriminative features with limited labels. Experiments show that SpikeMatch
outperforms existing SSL methods adapted to SNN backbones across various
standard benchmarks.

### [148] [Vision-Language Alignment from Compressed Image Representations using 2D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22615)
*Yasmine Omri,Connor Ding,Tsachy Weissman,Thierry Tambe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探索使用2D高斯泼溅（2DGS）作为视觉语言模型的替代视觉表示，解决了RGB图像传输效率低和序列长度爆炸的问题，实现了90倍加速和97%GPU利用率，在保持语义能力的同时实现3-20倍输入压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RGB视觉编码器的两个结构性问题：(i)从边缘设备传输密集RGB图像能耗高、成本大；(ii)基于补丁的标记化导致序列长度爆炸，给注意力预算和上下文限制带来压力。

Method: 开发可扩展的2DGS流水线，包括结构化初始化、亮度感知剪枝和批量CUDA内核；通过重用冻结的RGB变换器骨干，添加轻量级泼溅感知输入干和感知重采样器，仅训练约7%参数来适应对比语言图像预训练（CLIP）。

Result: 在DataComp子集上，GS编码器实现了有意义的零样本ImageNet-1K性能，同时相对于像素将输入压缩3-20倍；虽然准确率目前落后于RGB编码器，但建立了2DGS作为可行多模态基底的可行性。

Conclusion: 2DGS被确立为可行的多模态基底，识别了架构瓶颈，并为开发既语义强大又传输高效的边缘云学习表示开辟了路径。

Abstract: Modern vision language pipelines are driven by RGB vision encoders trained on
massive image text corpora. While these pipelines have enabled impressive zero
shot capabilities and strong transfer across tasks, they still inherit two
structural inefficiencies from the pixel domain: (i) transmitting dense RGB
images from edge devices to the cloud is energy intensive and costly, and (ii)
patch based tokenization explodes sequence length, stressing attention budgets
and context limits. We explore 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) as an alternative
visual substrate for alignment: a compact, spatially adaptive representation
that parameterizes images by a set of colored anisotropic Gaussians. We develop
a scalable 2DGS pipeline with structured initialization, luminance aware
pruning, and batched CUDA kernels, achieving over 90x faster fitting and about
97% GPU utilization compared to prior implementations. We further adapt
contrastive language image pretraining (CLIP) to 2DGS by reusing a frozen
RGB-based transformer backbone with a lightweight splat aware input stem and a
perceiver resampler, training only about 7% of the total parameters. On large
DataComp subsets, GS encoders yield meaningful zero shot ImageNet-1K
performance while compressing inputs 3 to 20x relative to pixels. While
accuracy currently trails RGB encoders, our results establish 2DGS as a viable
multimodal substrate, pinpoint architectural bottlenecks, and open a path
toward representations that are both semantically powerful and transmission
efficient for edge cloud learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LongLive是一个用于实时交互式长视频生成的帧级自回归框架，通过KV重缓存、流式长调优和帧级注意力汇等关键技术，在保持高质量的同时实现高效生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长视频生成在效率和质量上的挑战：扩散模型效率低，因果注意力AR模型在长视频上质量下降，同时需要支持交互式流式提示输入以增强动态内容创作能力。

Method: 采用因果帧级自回归设计，集成KV重缓存机制用于平滑提示切换，流式长调优实现长视频训练，短窗口注意力配合帧级注意力汇保持长程一致性。

Result: 仅用32 GPU天将13亿参数短片段模型微调至分钟级生成，在单H100 GPU上维持20.7 FPS，支持240秒视频生成，INT8量化推理质量损失极小。

Conclusion: LongLive框架成功解决了长视频生成的效率和质量平衡问题，支持实时交互式生成，为动态内容创作提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We present LongLive, a frame-level autoregressive (AR) framework for
real-time and interactive long video generation. Long video generation presents
challenges in both efficiency and quality. Diffusion and Diffusion-Forcing
models can produce high-quality videos but suffer from low efficiency due to
bidirectional attention. Causal attention AR models support KV caching for
faster inference, but often degrade in quality on long videos due to memory
challenges during long-video training. In addition, beyond static prompt-based
generation, interactive capabilities, such as streaming prompt inputs, are
critical for dynamic content creation, enabling users to guide narratives in
real time. This interactive requirement significantly increases complexity,
especially in ensuring visual consistency and semantic coherence during prompt
transitions. To address these challenges, LongLive adopts a causal, frame-level
AR design that integrates a KV-recache mechanism that refreshes cached states
with new prompts for smooth, adherent switches; streaming long tuning to enable
long video training and to align training and inference (train-long-test-long);
and short window attention paired with a frame-level attention sink, shorten as
frame sink, preserving long-range consistency while enabling faster generation.
With these key designs, LongLive fine-tunes a 1.3B-parameter short-clip model
to minute-long generation in just 32 GPU-days. At inference, LongLive sustains
20.7 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100, achieves strong performance on VBench in both
short and long videos. LongLive supports up to 240-second videos on a single
H100 GPU. LongLive further supports INT8-quantized inference with only marginal
quality loss.

### [150] [SPARK: Synergistic Policy And Reward Co-Evolving Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22624)
*Ziyu Liu,Yuhang Zang,Shengyuan Ding,Yuhang Cao,Xiaoyi Dong,Haodong Duan,Dahua Lin,Jiaqi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPARK框架通过循环利用RLVR中的rollouts和正确性数据，同时训练模型作为生成式奖励模型，消除了对单独奖励模型和人类偏好数据的需求，在多个基准测试中显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RLHF成本高和奖励-策略不匹配问题，以及RLVR浪费监督信息的问题，提出更高效、稳定且无需外部奖励模型的方法。

Method: 基于RLVR构建协同进化的策略和奖励框架，循环利用rollouts和正确性数据，通过点对点奖励评分、成对比较和反思条件评估等混合目标训练模型自我评估和改进。

Result: SPARK在多个LLM和LVLM模型上实现显著性能提升，如SPARK-VL-7B在7个推理基准上平均提升9.7%，在2个奖励基准上提升12.1%，在8个通用基准上提升1.5%。

Conclusion: SPARK通过协同进化的反馈循环实现了高效稳定的强化学习，支持无需外部奖励模型的自反思扩展，展现了强大的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
increasingly use Reinforcement Learning (RL) for post-pretraining, such as RL
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for objective tasks and RL from Human Feedback
(RLHF) for subjective tasks. However, RLHF incurs high costs and potential
reward-policy mismatch due to reliance on human preferences, while RLVR still
wastes supervision by discarding rollouts and correctness signals after each
update. To address these challenges, we introduce the Synergistic Policy And
Reward Co-Evolving Framework (SPARK), an efficient, on-policy, and stable
method that builds on RLVR. Instead of discarding rollouts and correctness
data, SPARK recycles this valuable information to simultaneously train the
model itself as a generative reward model. This auxiliary training uses a mix
of objectives, such as pointwise reward score, pairwise comparison, and
evaluation conditioned on further-reflection responses, to teach the model to
evaluate and improve its own responses. Our process eliminates the need for a
separate reward model and costly human preference data. SPARK creates a
positive co-evolving feedback loop: improved reward accuracy yields better
policy gradients, which in turn produce higher-quality rollouts that further
refine the reward model. Our unified framework supports test-time scaling via
self-reflection without external reward models and their associated costs. We
show that SPARK achieves significant performance gains on multiple LLM and LVLM
models and multiple reasoning, reward models, and general benchmarks. For
example, SPARK-VL-7B achieves an average 9.7% gain on 7 reasoning benchmarks,
12.1% on 2 reward benchmarks, and 1.5% on 8 general benchmarks over the
baselines, demonstrating robustness and broad generalization.

*Alexandre Lopes,Roberto Souza,Helio Pedrini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型自监督卷积方法CCNeXt，在深度估计任务中超越了现有CNN和ViT模型，同时平衡计算成本，在KITTI数据集上取得了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度估计在机器人、自动驾驶和增强现实中至关重要，但这些场景通常受计算能力限制。由于难以获取多样化场景的可靠深度真值数据，自监督技术成为解决方案。

Method: CCNeXt架构采用现代CNN特征提取器，在编码器中引入新颖的窗口化极线交叉注意力模块，并全面重新设计了深度估计解码器。

Result: 在KITTI Eigen Split测试数据上达到竞争性指标，比当前最佳模型快10.18倍，在KITTI Eigen Split改进真值和Driving Stereo数据集的所有指标上均取得最先进结果。

Conclusion: CCNeXt在深度估计任务中实现了性能与计算效率的良好平衡，为实际应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Depth Estimation plays a crucial role in recent applications in robotics,
autonomous vehicles, and augmented reality. These scenarios commonly operate
under constraints imposed by computational power. Stereo image pairs offer an
effective solution for depth estimation since it only needs to estimate the
disparity of pixels in image pairs to determine the depth in a known rectified
system. Due to the difficulty in acquiring reliable ground-truth depth data
across diverse scenarios, self-supervised techniques emerge as a solution,
particularly when large unlabeled datasets are available. We propose a novel
self-supervised convolutional approach that outperforms existing
state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers
(ViTs) while balancing computational cost. The proposed CCNeXt architecture
employs a modern CNN feature extractor with a novel windowed epipolar
cross-attention module in the encoder, complemented by a comprehensive redesign
of the depth estimation decoder. Our experiments demonstrate that CCNeXt
achieves competitive metrics on the KITTI Eigen Split test data while being
10.18$\times$ faster than the current best model and achieves state-of-the-art
results in all metrics in the KITTI Eigen Split Improved Ground Truth and
Driving Stereo datasets when compared to recently proposed techniques. To
ensure complete reproducibility, our project is accessible at

*Hongyu Chen,Guangrun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UML-CoT是一种基于统一建模语言的结构化推理框架，通过UML类图和活动图生成符号推理链和可执行动作计划，在杂乱房间清洁任务中优于非结构化CoT。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的思维链提示依赖非结构化文本，在具身任务中缺乏可解释性和可执行性。现有结构化CoT方法只能建模低阶关系，缺乏继承、行为抽象等构造，也没有标准化的顺序或条件规划语义。

Method: 提出UML-CoT框架，使用UML类图捕捉组合对象语义，活动图建模过程控制流。采用三阶段训练流程，结合监督微调和GRPO策略优化，包括从仅答案数据中学习奖励。

Result: 在MRoom-30k基准测试中，UML-CoT在可解释性、规划连贯性和执行成功率方面优于非结构化CoT方法。

Conclusion: UML作为一种更具表达力和可操作性的结构化推理形式化方法，在具身推理任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning in large language models
(LLMs), but its reliance on unstructured text limits interpretability and
executability in embodied tasks. Prior work has explored structured CoTs using
scene or logic graphs, yet these remain fundamentally limited: they model only
low-order relations, lack constructs like inheritance or behavioral
abstraction, and provide no standardized semantics for sequential or
conditional planning. We propose UML-CoT, a structured reasoning and planning
framework that leverages Unified Modeling Language (UML) to generate symbolic
CoTs and executable action plans. UML class diagrams capture compositional
object semantics, while activity diagrams model procedural control flow. Our
three-stage training pipeline combines supervised fine-tuning with Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), including reward learning from answer-only
data. We evaluate UML-CoT on MRoom-30k, a new benchmark of cluttered
room-cleaning scenarios. UML-CoT outperforms unstructured CoTs in
interpretability, planning coherence, and execution success, highlighting UML
as a more expressive and actionable structured reasoning formalism.

TL;DR: Labeling Copilot是首个用于计算机视觉的数据策展深度研究代理，通过多模态语言模型驱动的中央编排器，结合校准发现、可控合成和共识标注三大核心能力，有效解决高质量领域特定数据集构建的瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建高质量、领域特定的数据集是部署稳健视觉系统的主要瓶颈，需要在数据质量、多样性和成本之间进行复杂权衡。

Method: 采用多模态语言模型驱动的中央编排器，通过多步推理执行三个核心工具：校准发现从大型存储库中获取相关数据；可控合成生成罕见场景的新数据；共识标注通过结合非极大值抑制和投票的新共识机制协调多个基础模型产生准确标签。

Result: 在密集COCO数据集上，共识标注模块平均每张图像产生14.2个候选提案，是真实标注对象7.4个的近两倍，最终标注mAP达到37.1%。在Open Images数据集上发现了903个新的边界框类别，总能力扩展到1500多个类别。校准发现在1000万样本规模测试中，主动学习策略比替代方案计算效率高40倍。

Conclusion: 实验验证了具有优化、可扩展工具的代理工作流程为构建工业规模数据集提供了稳健基础。

Abstract: Curating high-quality, domain-specific datasets is a major bottleneck for
deploying robust vision systems, requiring complex trade-offs between data
quality, diversity, and cost when researching vast, unlabeled data lakes. We
introduce Labeling Copilot, the first data curation deep research agent for
computer vision. A central orchestrator agent, powered by a large multimodal
language model, uses multi-step reasoning to execute specialized tools across
three core capabilities: (1) Calibrated Discovery sources relevant,
in-distribution data from large repositories; (2) Controllable Synthesis
generates novel data for rare scenarios with robust filtering; and (3)
Consensus Annotation produces accurate labels by orchestrating multiple
foundation models via a novel consensus mechanism incorporating non-maximum
suppression and voting. Our large-scale validation proves the effectiveness of
Labeling Copilot's components. The Consensus Annotation module excels at object
discovery: on the dense COCO dataset, it averages 14.2 candidate proposals per
image-nearly double the 7.4 ground-truth objects-achieving a final annotation
mAP of 37.1%. On the web-scale Open Images dataset, it navigated extreme class
imbalance to discover 903 new bounding box categories, expanding its capability
to over 1500 total. Concurrently, our Calibrated Discovery tool, tested at a
10-million sample scale, features an active learning strategy that is up to 40x
more computationally efficient than alternatives with equivalent sample
efficiency. These experiments validate that an agentic workflow with optimized,
scalable tools provides a robust foundation for curating industrial-scale
datasets.

TL;DR: DIPSY是一种无需训练的少样本图像分类方法，利用IP-Adapter进行图像到图像转换，通过正负图像条件控制和类相似性采样策略生成判别性合成图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决少样本图像分类中标记数据有限的问题，避免现有方法需要模型微调或外部信息源的依赖。

Method: 使用IP-Adapter进行图像到图像转换，引入扩展的无分类器引导方案实现正负图像条件独立控制，采用类相似性采样策略选择有效对比样本，构建无需模型微调或外部工具的简单流程。

Result: 在十个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法达到最先进或可比性能，无需生成模型适应或依赖外部工具进行标题生成和图像过滤。

Conclusion: 通过正负引导的双图像提示能有效生成类判别特征，特别适用于细粒度分类任务。

Abstract: Few-shot image classification remains challenging due to the limited
availability of labeled examples. Recent approaches have explored generating
synthetic training data using text-to-image diffusion models, but often require
extensive model fine-tuning or external information sources. We present a novel
training-free approach, called DIPSY, that leverages IP-Adapter for
image-to-image translation to generate highly discriminative synthetic images
using only the available few-shot examples. DIPSY introduces three key
innovations: (1) an extended classifier-free guidance scheme that enables
independent control over positive and negative image conditioning; (2) a class
similarity-based sampling strategy that identifies effective contrastive
examples; and (3) a simple yet effective pipeline that requires no model
fine-tuning or external captioning and filtering. Experiments across ten
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art or
comparable performance, while eliminating the need for generative model
adaptation or reliance on external tools for caption generation and image
filtering. Our results highlight the effectiveness of leveraging dual image
prompting with positive-negative guidance for generating class-discriminative
features, particularly for fine-grained classification tasks.

TL;DR: 本文揭示了自回归视觉生成模型VAR与离散扩散模型的数学等价性，提出了SRDD框架，将扩散模型的优势引入VAR，提高了效率和生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视VAR模型，发现当配备马尔可夫注意力掩码时，VAR在数学上等同于离散扩散模型，这为将扩散模型的优势引入自回归变换器提供了理论基础。

Method: 提出SRDD框架，通过马尔可夫注意力掩码将VAR重新解释为离散扩散模型，从而直接引入扩散模型的迭代优化等优势，减少架构低效性。

Result: 实验表明，基于扩散视角的VAR在多个数据集上实现了更快的收敛、更低的推理成本、改进的零样本重建能力，并在效率和生成质量方面获得一致提升。

Conclusion: 建立了自回归变换器与扩散模型之间的理论桥梁，证明了扩散视角能够显著提升VAR模型的性能和效率，为视觉生成提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) transformers have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
visual generation, largely due to their scalability, computational efficiency
and unified architecture with language and vision. Among them, next scale
prediction Visual Autoregressive Generation (VAR) has recently demonstrated
remarkable performance, even surpassing diffusion-based models. In this work,
we revisit VAR and uncover a theoretical insight: when equipped with a
Markovian attention mask, VAR is mathematically equivalent to a discrete
diffusion. We term this reinterpretation as Scalable Visual Refinement with
Discrete Diffusion (SRDD), establishing a principled bridge between AR
transformers and diffusion models. Leveraging this new perspective, we show how
one can directly import the advantages of diffusion such as iterative
refinement and reduce architectural inefficiencies into VAR, yielding faster
convergence, lower inference cost, and improved zero-shot reconstruction.
Across multiple datasets, we show that the diffusion based perspective of VAR
leads to consistent gains in efficiency and generation.

*Zhen-Hao Wen,Yan Wang,Ji Feng,Han-Jia Ye,De-Chuan Zhan,Da-Wei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了HERMAN方法，通过层次化表示匹配增强CLIP在类增量学习中的性能，利用LLM生成分层文本描述符来改进语义空间表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP方法使用简单模板（如"a photo of a [CLASS]"）忽略了视觉概念的层次性，且仅使用最后一层特征，忽略了早期层的层次信息。

Method: 利用LLM递归生成区分性文本描述符，将这些描述符匹配到语义层次的不同级别，并根据任务需求自适应路由，实现精确区分并减轻灾难性遗忘。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法持续实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: HERMAN方法通过层次化表示匹配有效提升了CLIP在类增量学习中的表现，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to endow models with the ability to
continuously adapt to evolving data streams. Recent advances in pre-trained
vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) provide a powerful foundation for this
task. However, existing approaches often rely on simplistic templates, such as
"a photo of a [CLASS]", which overlook the hierarchical nature of visual
concepts. For example, recognizing "cat" versus "car" depends on coarse-grained
cues, while distinguishing "cat" from "lion" requires fine-grained details.
Similarly, the current feature mapping in CLIP relies solely on the
representation from the last layer, neglecting the hierarchical information
contained in earlier layers. In this work, we introduce HiErarchical
Representation MAtchiNg (HERMAN) for CLIP-based CIL. Our approach leverages
LLMs to recursively generate discriminative textual descriptors, thereby
augmenting the semantic space with explicit hierarchical cues. These
descriptors are matched to different levels of the semantic hierarchy and
adaptively routed based on task-specific requirements, enabling precise
discrimination while alleviating catastrophic forgetting in incremental tasks.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: DeeptraceReward是首个细粒度、时空感知的基准数据集，用于标注人类感知的AI生成视频伪影痕迹，包含4.3K详细标注，训练的多模态奖励模型在伪影识别、定位和解释方面优于GPT-5 34.7%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然视频生成模型快速发展，但人类是否能检测深度伪造痕迹这一关键维度被忽视，需要建立基准来评估人类对AI生成视频伪影的感知能力。

Method: 构建包含4.3K详细标注的数据集，标注包括自然语言解释、边界框区域定位、精确时间戳；将标注整合为9类深度伪造痕迹；训练多模态语言模型作为奖励模型模仿人类判断和定位。

Result: 7B奖励模型在伪影识别、定位和解释方面平均优于GPT-5 34.7%；发现一致的难度梯度：二元分类最容易，细粒度检测更难，其中自然语言解释最容易，空间定位次之，时间标注最难。

Conclusion: 通过突出人类感知的深度伪造痕迹，DeeptraceReward为社会意识和可信赖的视频生成提供了严格的测试平台和训练信号。

Abstract: Can humans identify AI-generated (fake) videos and provide grounded reasons?
While video generation models have advanced rapidly, a critical dimension --
whether humans can detect deepfake traces within a generated video, i.e.,
spatiotemporal grounded visual artifacts that reveal a video as machine
generated -- has been largely overlooked. We introduce DeeptraceReward, the
first fine-grained, spatially- and temporally- aware benchmark that annotates
human-perceived fake traces for video generation reward. The dataset comprises
4.3K detailed annotations across 3.3K high-quality generated videos. Each
annotation provides a natural-language explanation, pinpoints a bounding-box
region containing the perceived trace, and marks precise onset and offset
timestamps. We consolidate these annotations into 9 major categories of
deepfake traces that lead humans to identify a video as AI-generated, and train
multimodal language models (LMs) as reward models to mimic human judgments and
localizations. On DeeptraceReward, our 7B reward model outperforms GPT-5 by
34.7% on average across fake clue identification, grounding, and explanation.
Interestingly, we observe a consistent difficulty gradient: binary fake v.s.
real classification is substantially easier than fine-grained deepfake trace
detection; within the latter, performance degrades from natural language
explanations (easiest), to spatial grounding, to temporal labeling (hardest).
By foregrounding human-perceived deepfake traces, DeeptraceReward provides a
rigorous testbed and training signal for socially aware and trustworthy video
generation.

Result: 在CapRL-5M数据集上预训练后，在12个基准测试中取得显著提升；在Prism评估框架中性能与Qwen2.5-VL-72B相当，平均超出基线8.4%。

Conclusion: CapRL是首个将RLVR应用于主观图像描述任务的研究，证明了通过实用性定义描述质量的有效性，为图像描述生成提供了新的训练范式。

Abstract: Image captioning is a fundamental task that bridges the visual and linguistic
domains, playing a critical role in pre-training Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs). Current state-of-the-art captioning models are typically trained with
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), a paradigm that relies on expensive, non-scalable
data annotated by humans or proprietary models. This approach often leads to
models that memorize specific ground-truth answers, limiting their generality
and ability to generate diverse, creative descriptions. To overcome the
limitation of SFT, we propose applying the Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) paradigm to the open-ended task of image captioning.
A primary challenge, however, is designing an objective reward function for the
inherently subjective nature of what constitutes a "good" caption. We introduce
Captioning Reinforcement Learning (CapRL), a novel training framework that
redefines caption quality through its utility: a high-quality caption should
enable a non-visual language model to accurately answer questions about the
corresponding image. CapRL employs a decoupled two-stage pipeline where an LVLM
generates a caption, and the objective reward is derived from the accuracy of a
separate, vision-free LLM answering Multiple-Choice Questions based solely on
that caption. As the first study to apply RLVR to the subjective image
captioning task, we demonstrate that CapRL significantly enhances multiple
settings. Pretraining on the CapRL-5M caption dataset annotated by CapRL-3B
results in substantial gains across 12 benchmarks. Moreover, within the Prism
Framework for caption quality evaluation, CapRL achieves performance comparable
to Qwen2.5-VL-72B, while exceeding the baseline by an average margin of 8.4%.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练或架构修改的引用分割方法，通过利用扩散变换器的特征和注意力机制，在零样本设置下实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 扩散变换器的特征可直接用于下游任务，通过适当的注意力机制处理，可以在不进行训练的情况下实现强大的引用分割性能。

Abstract: Most existing approaches to referring segmentation achieve strong performance
only through fine-tuning or by composing multiple pre-trained models, often at
the cost of additional training and architectural modifications. Meanwhile,
large-scale generative diffusion models encode rich semantic information,
making them attractive as general-purpose feature extractors. In this work, we
introduce a new method that directly exploits features, attention scores, from
diffusion transformers for downstream tasks, requiring neither architectural
modifications nor additional training. To systematically evaluate these
features, we extend benchmarks with vision-language grounding tasks spanning
both images and videos. Our key insight is that stop words act as attention
magnets: they accumulate surplus attention and can be filtered to reduce noise.
Moreover, we identify global attention sinks (GAS) emerging in deeper layers
and show that they can be safely suppressed or redirected onto auxiliary
tokens, leading to sharper and more accurate grounding maps. We further propose
an attention redistribution strategy, where appended stop words partition
background activations into smaller clusters, yielding sharper and more
localized heatmaps. Building on these findings, we develop RefAM, a simple
training-free grounding framework that combines cross-attention maps, GAS
handling, and redistribution. Across zero-shot referring image and video
segmentation benchmarks, our approach consistently outperforms prior methods,
establishing a new state of the art without fine-tuning or additional
components.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文证明了在量子零和博弈中，矩阵版本的Nesterov迭代平滑和乐观梯度下降上升算法能够实现线性最后迭代收敛速率，打破了之前关于量子可行集与经典多面体集之间存在性能差距的猜想。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子零和博弈作为现代量子非局域博弈、量子交互证明和量子机器学习等领域的重要模型，其收敛性能一直受到关注。之前的研究认为量子可行集（谱面体）与经典多面体集（单纯形）之间存在根本性能差距，本文旨在验证这一猜想。

Method: 采用矩阵版本的Nesterov迭代平滑和乐观梯度下降上升算法，并基于半定规划几何中误差界的新推广来分析单调算子在谱面体上的性质。

Result: 证明了在量子零和博弈中，所提算法能够实现线性最后迭代收敛速率，与经典多面体情况相匹配，同时获得了对严格正半定规划并行近似的指数级加速。

Conclusion: 成功否定了量子可行集与经典多面体集之间存在性能差距的猜想，为量子博弈和优化算法提供了新的理论保证。

Abstract: Long studied as a toy model, quantum zero-sum games have recently resurfaced
as a canonical playground for modern areas such as non-local games, quantum
interactive proofs, and quantum machine learning. In this simple yet
fundamental setting, two competing quantum players send iteratively mixed
quantum states to a referee, who performs a joint measurement to determine
their payoffs. In 2025, Vasconcelos et al. [arXiv:2311.10859] connected quantum
communication channels with a hierarchy of quantum optimization algorithms that
generalize Matrix Multiplicative Weights Update ($\texttt{MMWU}$) through
extra-gradient mechanisms, establishing an average-iterate convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon)$ iterations to $\epsilon$-Nash equilibria. While a
long line of work has shown that bilinear games over polyhedral domains admit
gradient methods with linear last-iterate convergence rates of
$\mathcal{O}(\log(1/\epsilon))$, it has been conjectured that a fundamental
performance gap must persist between quantum feasible sets (spectraplexes) and
classical polyhedral sets (simplices). We resolve this conjecture in the
negative. We prove that matrix variants of $\textit{Nesterov's iterative
smoothing}$ ($\texttt{IterSmooth}$) and $\textit{Optimistic Gradient
Descent-Ascent}$ ($\texttt{OGDA}$) achieve last-iterate convergence at a linear
rate in quantum zero-sum games, thereby matching the classical polyhedral case.
Our analysis relies on a new generalization of error bounds in semidefinite
programming geometry, establishing that (SP-MS) holds for monotone operators
over spectrahedra, despite their uncountably many extreme points. Finally, as a
byproduct, we obtain an exponential speed-up over the classical Jain-Watrous
[arXiv:0808.2775] method for parallel approximation of strictly positive
semidefinite programs.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个联邦学习的博弈论框架，解决数据贡献激励不一致问题，设计了策略证明的支付机制来促进合作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习通过聚合多个代理的数据来提高样本效率，但存在激励不一致问题：每个更新对贡献者成本高昂，但所有参与者都能受益。

Method: 引入博弈论框架捕捉异构数据特性，分析成本最小化贡献向量，证明其NP难解性，提出多项式时间线性规划获得对数近似解，并设计基于贡献的支付规则。

Result: 证明无协调博弈存在病理情况，纯均衡可能不存在，最佳均衡成本可能远高于合作成本。提出的机制在贡献转移类中是唯一的策略证明机制。

Conclusion: 通过博弈论分析和机制设计，解决了联邦学习中的数据贡献激励问题，提出了有效的合作促进机制。

Abstract: Federated learning promises significant sample-efficiency gains by pooling
data across multiple agents, yet incentive misalignment is an obstacle: each
update is costly to the contributor but boosts every participant. We introduce
a game-theoretic framework that captures heterogeneous data: an agent's utility
depends on who supplies each sample, not just how many. Agents aim to meet a
PAC-style accuracy threshold at minimal personal cost. We show that
uncoordinated play yields pathologies: pure equilibria may not exist, and the
best equilibrium can be arbitrarily more costly than cooperation. To steer
collaboration, we analyze the cost-minimizing contribution vector, prove that
computing it is NP-hard, and derive a polynomial-time linear program that
achieves a logarithmic approximation. Finally, pairing the LP with a simple
pay-what-you-contribute rule - each agent receives a payment equal to its
sample cost - yields a mechanism that is strategyproof and, within the class of
contribution-based transfers, is unique.

Motivation: 从经纪人视角研究双边贸易问题，旨在最大化利润而非效率，与以往关注最优固定价格的研究不同，本文以最优激励相容和个人理性机制为基准。

Method: 提出一种学习算法，通过仔细的链式分析克服机制利润无法一致收敛的困难，在随机估值环境下实现遗憾最小化。

Result: 在随机设置下实现 $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ 遗憾，在非平稳环境下无法实现次线性遗憾，并将技术应用于联合广告问题获得类似结果。

Conclusion: 本文为双边贸易中的利润最大化提供了有效的学习算法，并展示了该技术在更广泛问题中的适用性。

Abstract: Bilateral trade models the task of intermediating between two strategic
agents, a seller and a buyer, willing to trade a good for which they hold
private valuations. We study this problem from the perspective of a broker, in
a regret minimization framework. At each time step, a new seller and buyer
arrive, and the broker has to propose a mechanism that is incentive-compatible
and individually rational, with the goal of maximizing profit.
  We propose a learning algorithm that guarantees a nearly tight
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret in the stochastic setting when seller and buyer
valuations are drawn i.i.d. from a fixed and possibly correlated unknown
distribution. We further show that it is impossible to achieve sublinear regret
in the non-stationary scenario where valuations are generated upfront by an
adversary. Our ambitious benchmark for these results is the best
incentive-compatible and individually rational mechanism. This separates us
from previous works on efficiency maximization in bilateral trade, where the
benchmark is a single number: the best fixed price in hindsight.
  A particular challenge we face is that uniform convergence for all
mechanisms' profits is impossible. We overcome this difficulty via a careful
chaining analysis that proves convergence for a provably near-optimal mechanism
at (essentially) optimal rate. We further showcase the broader applicability of
our techniques by providing nearly optimal results for the joint ads problem.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出了一个信息拓扑框架，将循环闭合作为记忆和意识的基本机制。记忆不是静态存储，而是重新进入神经状态空间中潜在循环的能力，不变循环通过过滤特定顺序噪声并保留跨上下文持久内容来承载意义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统记忆模型无法解释记忆的动态性和意识现象，需要基于循环闭合机制的新框架来理解记忆如何在不同上下文中保持稳定性，以及意识如何从神经活动中涌现。

Method: 使用信息拓扑理论，结合点-循环二分法：瞬态点支撑探索，非平凡循环编码低熵内容不变量。生物上通过多时相神经群实现1-循环，嵌套在theta-gamma节律中，通过层级组合形成复杂记忆和认知。

Result: 建立了循环闭合作为记忆和意识统一机制的理论框架，解释了记忆的稳定性、意识的统一性和丰富性，以及如何在非遍历环境中实现泛化。

Conclusion: 循环就是一切所需：持久不变量能够在具有长期一致性的非遍历环境中以最小能量成本实现泛化，循环闭合是记忆和意识的基本原理。

Abstract: We propose an information-topological framework in which cycle closure is the
fundamental mechanism of memory and consciousness. Memory is not a static store
but the ability to re-enter latent cycles in neural state space, with invariant
cycles serving as carriers of meaning by filtering order-specific noise and
preserving what persists across contexts. The dot-cycle dichotomy captures
this: transient dots scaffold exploration, while nontrivial cycles encode
low-entropy content invariants that stabilize memory. Biologically,
polychronous neural groups realize 1-cycles through delay-locked spiking
reinforced by STDP, nested within theta-gamma rhythms that enforce boundary
cancellation. These micro-cycles compose hierarchically, extending navigation
loops into general memory and cognition. The perception-action cycle introduces
high-order invariance: closure holds even across sense-act alternations,
generalizing ancestral homing behavior. Sheaf-cosheaf duality formalizes this
process: sheaves glue perceptual fragments into global sections, cosheaves
decompose global plans into actions and closure aligns top-down predictions
with bottom-up cycles. Consciousness then arises as the persistence of
high-order invariants that integrate (unity) yet differentiate (richness)
across contexts. We conclude that cycle is all you need: persistent invariants
enable generalization in non-ergodic environments with long-term coherence at
minimal energetic cost.

TL;DR: 该研究通过符号化代理建模方法，将Transformer嵌入转换为紧凑、可审计的分类器，并实现校准概率。使用多视图遗传编程学习加性闭式logit程序，在多个基准测试中取得优异性能。


<details>

Motivation: 研究旨在开发紧凑且可审计的分类器，能够提供校准的概率估计，同时保持对Transformer嵌入的忠实解释。

Method: 采用语义保持特征划分(SPFP)将嵌入划分为不相交的信息保留视图，然后使用合作多群体遗传程序(MEGP)学习这些视图上的加性闭式logit程序。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上，代理模型实现了强大的判别性能（MNIST、CIFAR10、MSC17的F1约0.99，SST2G约0.95），温度缩放显著降低了预期校准误差(ECE)。

Conclusion: 该方法成功生成了具有校准概率的紧凑符号分类器，提供了基于显式程序的可解释、跨模态解释。

Abstract: We study symbolic surrogate modeling of frozen Transformer embeddings to
obtain compact, auditable classifiers with calibrated probabilities. For five
benchmarks (SST2G, 20NG, MNIST, CIFAR10, MSC17), embeddings from ModernBERT,
DINOv2, and SigLIP are partitioned on the training set into disjoint,
information-preserving views via semantic-preserving feature partitioning
(SPFP). A cooperative multi-population genetic program (MEGP) then learns
additive, closed-form logit programs over these views. Across 30 runs per
dataset we report F1, AUC, log-loss, Brier, expected calibration error (ECE),
and symbolic complexity; a canonical model is chosen by a one-standard-error
rule on validation F1 with a parsimony tie-break. Temperature scaling fitted on
validation yields substantial ECE reductions on test. The resulting surrogates
achieve strong discrimination (up to F1 around 0.99 on MNIST, CIFAR10, MSC17;
around 0.95 on SST2G), while 20NG remains most challenging. We provide
reliability diagrams, dimension usage and overlap statistics,
contribution-based importances, and global effect profiles (PDP and ALE),
demonstrating faithful, cross-modal explanations grounded in explicit programs.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are exemplary deep models designed for graph
data. Message passing mechanism enables GNNs to effectively capture graph
topology and push the performance boundaries across various graph tasks.
However, the trend of developing such complex machinery for graph
representation learning has become unsustainable on large-scale graphs. The
computational and time overhead make it imperative to develop more
energy-efficient GNNs to cope with the explosive growth of real-world graphs.
Spiking Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs), which integrate biologically plausible
learning via unique spike-based neurons, have emerged as a promising
energy-efficient alternative. Different layers communicate with sparse and
binary spikes, which facilitates computation and storage of intermediate graph
representations. Despite the proliferation of SGNNs proposed in recent years,
there is no systematic benchmark to explore the basic design principles of
these brain-inspired networks on the graph data. To bridge this gap, we present
SGNNBench to quantify progress in the field of SGNNs. Specifically, SGNNBench
conducts an in-depth investigation of SGNNs from multiple perspectives,
including effectiveness, energy efficiency, and architectural design. We
comprehensively evaluate 9 state-of-the-art SGNNs across 18 datasets. Regarding
efficiency, we empirically compare these baselines w.r.t model size, memory
usage, and theoretical energy consumption to reveal the often-overlooked energy
bottlenecks of SGNNs. Besides, we elaborately investigate the design space of
SGNNs to promote the development of a general SGNN paradigm.

Abstract: This paper presents a neuromorphic system for cognitive load classification
in a real-world setting, an Air Traffic Control (ATC) task, using a hardware
implementation of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). Electroencephalogram (EEG)
and eye-tracking features, extracted from an open-source dataset, were used to
train and evaluate both conventional machine learning models and SNNs. Among
the SNN architectures explored, a minimalistic, single-layer model trained with
a biologically inspired delta-rule learning algorithm achieved competitive
performance (80.6%). To enable deployment on neuromorphic hardware, the model
was quantized and implemented on the mixed-signal DYNAP-SE chip. Despite
hardware constraints and analog variability, the chip-deployed SNN maintained a

Abstract: This study presents domain-informed genetic superposition programming
(DIGSP), a symbolic regression framework tailored for engineering systems
governed by separable physical mechanisms. DIGSP partitions the input space
into domain-specific feature subsets and evolves independent genetic
programming (GP) populations to model material-specific effects. Early
evolution occurs in isolation, while ensemble fitness promotes inter-population
cooperation. To enable symbolic superposition, an adaptive hierarchical
symbolic abstraction mechanism (AHSAM) is triggered after stagnation across all
populations. AHSAM performs analysis of variance- (ANOVA) based filtering to
identify statistically significant individuals, compresses them into symbolic
constructs, and injects them into all populations through a validation-guided
pruning cycle. The DIGSP is benchmarked against a baseline multi-gene genetic
programming (BGP) model using a dataset of steel fiber-reinforced concrete
(SFRC) beams. Across 30 independent trials with 65% training, 10% validation,
and 25% testing splits, DIGSP consistently outperformed BGP in training and
test root mean squared error (RMSE). The Wilcoxon rank-sum test confirmed
statistical significance (p < 0.01), and DIGSP showed tighter error
distributions and fewer outliers. No significant difference was observed in
validation RMSE due to limited sample size. These results demonstrate that
domain-informed structural decomposition and symbolic abstraction improve
convergence and generalization. DIGSP offers a principled and interpretable
modeling strategy for systems where symbolic superposition aligns with the
underlying physical structure.

Abstract: The rapidly increasing use of electric vehicles (EVs) has made it even more
important to manage the charging infrastructure sustainably. The expansion of
charging station networks, especially in large cities, creates serious
logistical challenges for charging point operators (CPOs) in planning
maintenance and repair activities. Inefficient field personnel management can
lead to time loss, high operational costs, and resource waste. This study
presents an integrated method to optimize the planning of EV charging network
maintenance operations. The proposed approach groups charging stations
according to geographical proximity using the K-means clustering algorithm and
calculates the shortest routes between clusters using a genetic algorithm. The
method was developed in Python and applied to a dataset consisting of 100 EV
charging stations in Istanbul.
  Considering the population density, traffic density, and resource constraints
of Istanbul, the route planning approach presented in this study has great
potential, especially for such metropolises. According to the different
parameter configurations tested, the most efficient scenario provided
approximately 35\% distance savings compared to the reference route created
according to the sequential data layout. While the reference route provides a
simple comparison, the study presents a solution that will enable field
operations in metropolitan cities such as Istanbul to be conducted in a more
efficient, planned and scalable manner. In future studies, it is planned to
integrate real-time factors such as traffic conditions and field technician
constraints.

\end{equation*} Our approach assumes that the social and economic effects of
criminal behavior can be modeled by a dynamic SIR-type system, which serves as
a constraint on a cost functional associated with the strategies implemented by
government and law enforcement authorities to reduce criminal behavior. Using
optimal control theory, the proposed controls, i.e., preventive policies (such
as community and social cohesion programs), are expected to have a significant
and positive impact on crime reduction, generating opportunities for the most
disadvantaged sectors of Cali society and contributing to long-term security.
Given that resources to address this problem are limited, this research aims to
determine an optimal combination of public interventions and policies that
minimize criminality at the lowest possible economic cost, using an SIR model,
tools from variational calculus, and optimal control theory.

TL;DR: 本文针对逆变器主导电力系统中多台虚拟同步发电机控制转换器引发的有功功率振荡问题，提出了基于RLC等效电路模型的物理直观分析方法，并开发了两种模式特定的抑制策略：独立运行模式下的图论阻抗控制和并网模式下的自适应惯量阻尼控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 逆变器主导电力系统中，多台虚拟同步发电机控制的转换器之间经常出现有功功率振荡，威胁系统稳定性和保护协调。现有方法大多依赖系统参数先验知识、阻尼性能有限或模型复杂缺乏物理可解释性，难以实际应用。

Abstract: Active power oscillations frequently arise in inverter-dominated power
systems with multiple converters operating under Virtual Synchronous Generator
control, posing risks to system stability and protection coordination. While
various mitigation strategies have been proposed, many rely on prior knowledge
of system parameters, offer limited damping performance, or involve complex
models that lack physical interpretability, making them difficult to apply in
practice. To address these challenges, this paper first introduces a physically
intuitive RLC equivalent circuit model to explain the root causes of APOs in
both stand-alone and grid-connected modes. By mapping inertia, damping, and
feeder impedance to capacitive, resistive, and inductive elements,
respectively, the model reveals how mismatches among converters lead to
inter-unit oscillations characterized by LC resonance. Building on this
insight, we propose two mode-specific mitigation strategies: in SA mode, a
graph theory based impedance control ensures proportional reactive power
sharing and effectively suppresses APOs; and in GC mode, adaptive inertia and
damping control with feedforward filtering is designed to reshape transient
power dynamics while preserving frequency stability. The proposed methods are
validated through extensive simulations and real-time hardware-in-the-loop
experiments, demonstrating their effectiveness in suppressing oscillations and
enhancing the robustness of multi-converter power systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式能源资源的兴起给现代配电网带来了新的电压稳定性挑战，传统方法难以在动态和分散的运行条件下有效工作。

Method: 使用分段线性ReLU网络替代传统线性近似来捕捉功率注入与电压幅值之间的非线性关系，并利用深度平衡模型对电压与逆变器响应之间的递归交互进行建模。

Abstract: The rise of distributed energy resources (DERs) is reshaping modern
distribution grids, introducing new challenges in attaining voltage stability
under dynamic and decentralized operating conditions. This paper presents
NEO-Grid, a unified learning-based framework for volt-var optimization (VVO)
and volt-var control (VVC) that leverages neural network surrogates for power
flow and deep equilibrium models (DEQs) for closed-loop control. Our method
replaces traditional linear approximations with piecewise-linear ReLU networks
trained to capture the nonlinear relationship between power injections and
voltage magnitudes. For control, we model the recursive interaction between
voltage and inverter response using DEQs, allowing direct fixed-point
computation and efficient training via implicit differentiation. We evaluated
NEO-Grid on the IEEE 33-bus system, demonstrating that it significantly
improves voltage regulation performance compared to standard linear and
heuristic baselines in both optimization and control settings. Our results
establish NEO-Grid as a scalable, accurate, and interpretable solution for
learning-based voltage regulation in distribution grids.

Conclusion: 提出的安全SDRE控制器在保证安全的同时实现轨迹跟踪，计算需求合理，适合在实际系统中实时实现，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for safety-critical optimal trajectory
tracking in nonlinear systems based on the state-dependent Riccati equation
(SDRE) methodology. By embedding barrier states into the system dynamics, the
proposed strategy simultaneously ensures safety and tracking requirements, even
in scenarios where these objectives may be inherently conflicting. A discounted
pseudo-quadratic cost function is formulated to achieve a suboptimal trade-off
between tracking accuracy, control effort, and safety objective. We present two
distinct controller designs: one utilizing a single barrier state to enforce
overall safety constraints, and another employing multiple barrier states to
individually tuning the system's conservatism with respect to each safety
constraint, providing enhanced flexibility in tuning the system's conservatism
toward individual constraints. We establish sufficient conditions to ensure the
solvability of the associated Riccati equations. The proposed safe controller
is well-suited for real-time implementation in practical systems, given its
reasonable computational requirements and compatibility with widely available
embedded microprocessors. This is supported by simulation studies involving a
mechanical system and a mobile robot collision avoidance scenario, where the
safe SDRE controller consistently maintained safety while achieving trajectory
tracking objectives in challenging conditions. Additionally, experimental
results on a cable-driven parallel robot further demonstrate the practical
applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method in real-world control
tasks.

Motivation: 传统交通信号控制方法难以处理动态交通模式，需要更智能的自适应控制来减少拥堵、延误和污染。

Method: 使用强化学习（PPO算法），采用扩展状态空间、自编码器表示和K-Planes启发表示等多种状态表示方法，在SUMO模拟器中实现自适应交通信号控制。

Result: 相比传统Webster方法，最佳配置实现约29%的平均排队长度减少，优于传统方法和常规RL方法。

Conclusion: 基于排队的强化学习方法在可扩展和自适应城市交通管理方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Efficient traffic signal control (TSC) is crucial for reducing congestion,
travel delays, pollution, and for ensuring road safety. Traditional approaches,
such as fixed signal control and actuated control, often struggle to handle
dynamic traffic patterns. In this study, we propose a novel adaptive TSC
framework that leverages Reinforcement Learning (RL), using the Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) algorithm, to minimize total queue lengths across all signal
phases. The challenge of efficiently representing highly stochastic traffic
conditions for an RL controller is addressed through multiple state
representations, including an expanded state space, an autoencoder
representation, and a K-Planes-inspired representation. The proposed algorithm
has been implemented using the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) traffic
simulator and demonstrates superior performance over both traditional methods
and other conventional RL-based approaches in reducing queue lengths. The best
performing configuration achieves an approximately 29% reduction in average
queue lengths compared to the traditional Webster method. Furthermore,
comparative evaluation of alternative reward formulations demonstrates the
effectiveness of the proposed queue-based approach, showcasing the potential
for scalable and adaptive urban traffic management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界复杂系统常建模为多层网络，现有网络控制理论主要关注单层网络，对多层网络分别控制会导致驱动节点冗余，增加成本和复杂性。

Method: 提出最短跨层增广路径搜索(CLAP-S)算法，引入跨层增广路径(CLAP)概念，迭代重新对齐每层的最小驱动集以最大化它们的重叠，证明算法全局最优性。

Conclusion: 这项工作为多层网络中的控制策略优化提供了强大通用工具，能够在多个领域实现更经济的干预。

Abstract: Many real-world complex systems can be modeled as multiplex networks, where
each layer represents a distinct set of interactions among the same entities.
Controlling such systems-steering them toward desired states using external
inputs-is crucial across many domains. However, existing network control theory
largely focuses on single-layer networks, and applying separate controls to
each layer of a multiplex system often leads to redundant sets of driver nodes,
increasing cost and complexity.
  To address this challenge, we formulate the Universal Minimum Union Driver
Set (MinUDS) problem for duplex networks. The goal is to find the smallest set
of driver nodes that can simultaneously control both layers.
  We propose a novel algorithm, Shortest Cross-Layer Augmenting Path Search
(CLAP-S). This method introduces the concept of a Cross-Layer Augmenting Path
(CLAP) and efficiently explores the combinatorial space of control
configurations. CLAP-S iteratively realigns each layer's Minimum Driver Set
(MDS) to maximize their overlap. We prove the algorithm's global optimality and
demonstrate its efficiency on both synthetic networks and real-world multiplex
systems.
  The results show that CLAP-S consistently outperforms baseline approaches by
significantly reducing the number of required driver nodes and cutting
computational time by an order of magnitude. This work provides a powerful,
general-purpose tool for optimizing control strategies in multi-layer networks,
enabling more economical interventions in diverse fields.

achieving leave-one-session-out accuracies of 64$\pm$18% and 54$\pm$7% for the
vocalized and silent experiments, respectively. These results highlight the
robustness of the proposed approach and the promise of energy-efficient

Motivation: 探索音乐与黄金比例之间的另一种联系，寻找能够表示音阶和和弦的几何结构。

Method: 在黄金三角形上排列7个音调，通过黄金三角形和黄金矩形来表示音阶和三和弦，构建金色Tonnetz系统。

Result: 发现黄金三角形可以表示给定大调/小调音阶及其主和弦、属和弦、下属和弦，金色Tonnetz能够表示所有大调/小调音阶和三和弦。

Conclusion: 黄金三角形提供了一种新的音乐几何表示方法，能够优雅地表示音阶、和弦以及新黎曼理论中的变换关系。

Abstract: Musical concepts have been represented by geometry with tones. For example,
in the chromatic circle, the twelve tones are represented by twelve points on a
circle, and in Tonnetz, the relationships among harmonies are represented by a
triangular lattice. Recently, we have shown that several arrangements of tones
on the regular icosahedron can be associated with chromatic scales, whole-tone
scales, major tones, and minor tones through the golden ratio. Here, we
investigate another type of connection between music and the golden ratio. We
show that there exists an arrangement of 7 tones on a golden triangle that can
represent a given major/minor scale and its tonic, dominant, and subdominant
chords by golden triangles. By applying this finding, we propose "golden
Tonnetz" which represents all the major/minor scales and triads by the golden
triangles or gnomons and also represents relative, parallel, and leading-tone
exchange transformations in Neo-Riemannian theory by transformations among the
golden triangles and gnomons.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在语音增强中性能优异但计算成本高，难以实时应用。流匹配技术提供了更高效的替代方案，能够用更少步骤实现高质量合成。

Method: SFMSE方法训练单一、步数不变的模型，通过将速度场条件化到目标时间步，在单阶段训练过程中实现单步、少步或多步去噪，无需架构更改或微调。

Result: 单步SFMSE推理在消费级GPU上达到0.013的实时因子，感知质量与需要60次神经网络评估的强扩散基线相当。

Conclusion: SFMSE成功弥合了高质量生成式语音增强与低延迟要求之间的差距，为实时应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have achieved state-of-the-art performance
for perceptual quality in speech enhancement (SE). However, their iterative
nature requires numerous Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs), posing a challenge
for real-time applications. On the contrary, flow matching offers a more
efficient alternative by learning a direct vector field, enabling high-quality
synthesis in just a few steps using deterministic ordinary differential
equation~(ODE) solvers. We thus introduce Shortcut Flow Matching for Speech
Enhancement (SFMSE), a novel approach that trains a single, step-invariant
model. By conditioning the velocity field on the target time step during a
one-stage training process, SFMSE can perform single, few, or multi-step
denoising without any architectural changes or fine-tuning. Our results
demonstrate that a single-step SFMSE inference achieves a real-time factor
(RTF) of 0.013 on a consumer GPU while delivering perceptual quality comparable
to a strong diffusion baseline requiring 60 NFEs. This work also provides an
empirical analysis of the role of stochasticity in training and inference,
bridging the gap between high-quality generative SE and low-latency
constraints.

Conclusion: 该算法在声音设计、声音变形和实时合成控制方面具有应用价值，提供了更完整的颤音转移功能。

Abstract: An algorithm for deriving delay functions based on real examples of vibrato
was recently introduced and can be used to perform a vibrato transfer, in which
the vibrato pattern of a target signal is imparted onto an incoming sound using
a delay line. The algorithm contains methods that computationally restrict a
real-time implementation. Here, a real-time approximation is presented that
incorporates an efficient fundamental frequency estimation algorithm and
time-domain polyphase IIR filters that approximate an analytic signal. The
vibrato transfer algorithm is further supplemented with a proposed method to
transfer the amplitude modulation of the target sound, moving this method
beyond the capabilities of typical delay-based vibrato effects. Modifications
to the original algorithm for real-time use are detailed here and available as
source code for an implementation as a VST plugin. This algorithm has
applications as an audio effect in sound design, sound morphing, and real-time
vibrato control of synthesized sounds.

to preserve and perform Antonio Russek's piece "Summermood" for bass flute and
live electronics. The piece, originally written for the DeltaLab DL-4 delay
rack unit, contains score markings specific to the DL-4. Here, we approximate
the sound and unique functionality of the DL-4 in Pure Data, then refine our
implementation to better match the unit on which the piece was performed by
comparing settings from the score to two official recordings of the piece. The
DL-4 emulation is integrated into a patch for live performance based on the
Null Piece, and regression tested using the Reality Check framework for Pure

rotation without the use of the now discontinued DL-4. The patches will be
continuously tested to ensure that the piece is playable across computer

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生成音频编辑模型依赖模板化指令格式且仅限于单声道音频，无法处理声明式音频编辑需求，即用户只需声明期望结果而将具体编辑操作细节留给系统处理。

Method: SmartDJ将高级指令分解为原子编辑操作序列（如添加、移除或空间重定位事件），然后通过训练好的扩散模型执行这些操作。为此设计了数据合成管道，生成包含高级指令、原子编辑操作以及编辑前后音频的配对示例。

Result: 实验表明，SmartDJ在感知质量、空间真实感和语义对齐方面优于先前的音频编辑方法。

Conclusion: SmartDJ框架成功实现了声明式立体声音频编辑，通过结合语言模型推理和扩散生成能力，能够根据高级指令自动完成复杂的音频编辑任务。

Abstract: Audio editing plays a central role in VR/AR immersion, virtual conferencing,
sound design, and other interactive media. However, recent generative audio
editing models depend on template-like instruction formats and are restricted
to mono-channel audio. These models fail to deal with declarative audio
editing, where the user declares what the desired outcome should be, while
leaving the details of editing operations to the system. We introduce SmartDJ,
a novel framework for stereo audio editing that combines the reasoning
capability of audio language models with the generative power of latent
diffusion. Given a high-level instruction, SmartDJ decomposes it into a
sequence of atomic edit operations, such as adding, removing, or spatially
relocating events. These operations are then executed by a diffusion model
trained to manipulate stereo audio. To support this, we design a data synthesis
pipeline that produces paired examples of high-level instructions, atomic edit
operations, and audios before and after each edit operation. Experiments
demonstrate that SmartDJ achieves superior perceptual quality, spatial realism,
and semantic alignment compared to prior audio editing methods. Demos are
available at https://zitonglan.github.io/project/smartdj/smartdj.html.

Conclusion: MusicWeaver通过结构计划作为可编辑中间表示，有效提升了音乐生成的长程结构一致性和编辑能力。

Abstract: Current music generators capture local textures but often fail to model
long-range structure, leading to off-beat outputs, weak section transitions,
and limited editing capability. We present MusicWeaver, a music generation
model conditioned on a beat-aligned structural plan. This plan serves as an
editable intermediate between the input prompt and the generated music,
preserving global form and enabling professional, localized edits. MusicWeaver
consists of a planner, which translates prompts into a structural plan encoding
musical form and compositional cues, and a diffusion-based generator, which
synthesizes music under the plan's guidance. To assess generation and editing
quality, we introduce two metrics: the Structure Coherence Score (SCS) for
evaluating long-range form and timing, and the Edit Fidelity Score (EFS) for
measuring the accuracy of realizing plan edits. Experiments demonstrate that
MusicWeaver achieves state-of-the-art fidelity and controllability, producing
music closer to human-composed works. Music results can be found on our project

Abstract: Modern audio deepfake detectors using foundation models and large training
datasets have achieved promising detection performance. However, they struggle
with zero-day attacks, where the audio samples are generated by novel synthesis
methods that models have not seen from reigning training data. Conventional
approaches against such attacks require fine-tuning the detectors, which can be
problematic when prompt response is required. This study introduces a
training-free framework for zero-day audio deepfake detection based on
knowledge representations, retrieval augmentation, and voice profile matching.
Based on the framework, we propose simple yet effective knowledge retrieval and
ensemble methods that achieve performance comparable to fine-tuned models on
DeepFake-Eval-2024, without any additional model-wise training. We also conduct
ablation studies on retrieval pool size and voice profile attributes,
validating their relevance to the system efficacy.

Abstract: Automatic drum transcription (ADT) is traditionally formulated as a
discriminative task to predict drum events from audio spectrograms. In this
work, we redefine ADT as a conditional generative task and introduce
Noise-to-Notes (N2N), a framework leveraging diffusion modeling to transform
audio-conditioned Gaussian noise into drum events with associated velocities.
This generative diffusion approach offers distinct advantages, including a
flexible speed-accuracy trade-off and strong inpainting capabilities. However,
the generation of binary onset and continuous velocity values presents a
challenge for diffusion models, and to overcome this, we introduce an Annealed
Pseudo-Huber loss to facilitate effective joint optimization. Finally, to
augment low-level spectrogram features, we propose incorporating features
extracted from music foundation models (MFMs), which capture high-level
semantic information and enhance robustness to out-of-domain drum audio.
Experimental results demonstrate that including MFM features significantly
improves robustness and N2N establishes a new state-of-the-art performance
across multiple ADT benchmarks.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种优化方法，通过层间帧重采样和渐进子带剪枝来降低语音增强的计算成本，同时保持ASR性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动语音识别在噪声环境中的鲁棒性仍然具有挑战性，而语音增强前端作为预处理步骤会引入显著的计算开销。

Method: 集成层间帧重采样和渐进子带剪枝。帧重采样在层内对输入进行下采样，利用残差连接减轻信息损失；子带剪枝逐步排除信息量较少的频带。

Result: 在合成和真实世界噪声数据集上的实验表明，该系统相比标准BSRNN减少了超过66%的SE计算开销，同时保持了强大的ASR性能。

Conclusion: 提出的优化方法能有效降低语音增强的计算成本而不影响ASR性能，为噪声环境下的语音识别提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in automatic speech recognition (ASR) have achieved
notable progress, whereas robustness in noisy environments remains challenging.
While speech enhancement (SE) front-ends are widely used to mitigate noise as a
preprocessing step for ASR, they often introduce computational non-negligible
overhead. This paper proposes optimizations to reduce SE computational costs
without compromising ASR performance. Our approach integrates layer-wise frame
resampling and progressive sub-band pruning. Frame resampling downsamples
inputs within layers, utilizing residual connections to mitigate information
loss. Simultaneously, sub-band pruning progressively excludes less informative
frequency bands, further reducing computational demands. Extensive experiments
on synthetic and real-world noisy datasets demonstrate that our system reduces
SE computational overhead over 66 compared to the standard BSRNN, while
maintaining strong ASR performance.

Motivation: 人类听觉感知受3D空间中移动声源影响，但现有生成声音模型主要局限于单声道或静态空间音频，需要开发能生成移动声音的方法。

Method: 构建合成数据集记录双耳格式的移动声音、空间轨迹和文本描述；训练文本到轨迹预测模型；微调预训练文本到音频模型生成时间对齐的单声道音频；使用预测轨迹模拟空间音频。

Result: 实验评估显示文本到轨迹模型具有合理的空间理解能力，该方法可轻松集成到现有文本到音频生成流程中。

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了可控的文本到移动声音生成，可扩展到其他空间音频格式的移动声音生成。

Abstract: Human auditory perception is shaped by moving sound sources in 3D space, yet
prior work in generative sound modelling has largely been restricted to mono
signals or static spatial audio. In this work, we introduce a framework for
generating moving sounds given text prompts in a controllable fashion. To
enable training, we construct a synthetic dataset that records moving sounds in
binaural format, their spatial trajectories, and text captions about the sound
event and spatial motion. Using this dataset, we train a text-to-trajectory
prediction model that outputs the three-dimensional trajectory of a moving
sound source given text prompts. To generate spatial audio, we first fine-tune
a pre-trained text-to-audio generative model to output temporally aligned mono
sound with the trajectory. The spatial audio is then simulated using the
predicted temporally-aligned trajectory. Experimental evaluation demonstrates
reasonable spatial understanding of the text-to-trajectory model. This approach
could be easily integrated into existing text-to-audio generative workflow and
extended to moving sound generation in other spatial audio formats.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the vulnerability of Automatic Speech
Recognition systems to adversarial examples, which can deceive these systems
into misinterpreting input speech commands. While previous research has
primarily focused on white-box attacks with constrained optimizations, and
transferability based black-box attacks against commercial Automatic Speech
Recognition devices, this paper explores cost efficient white-box attack and
non transferability black-box adversarial attacks on Automatic Speech
Recognition systems, drawing insights from approaches such as Fast Gradient
Sign Method and Zeroth-Order Optimization. Further, the novelty of the paper
includes how poisoning attack can degrade the performances of state-of-the-art
models leading to misinterpretation of audio signals. Through experimentation
and analysis, we illustrate how hybrid models can generate subtle yet impactful
adversarial examples with very little perturbation having Signal Noise Ratio of
35dB that can be generated within a minute. These vulnerabilities of
state-of-the-art open source model have practical security implications, and
emphasize the need for adversarial security.

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的自回归TTS系统虽然质量优秀，但面临神经音频编解码器离散化导致的信息损失、分层音频token缺乏明确语义结构，以及自回归过程容易累积错误的问题。

Method: 1) 提出S3Codec编解码器，通过语义蒸馏将语言特征注入主码本；2) 设计理解-生成双Transformer架构，分离理解与渲染过程；3) 引入MAPI并行推理策略增强生成稳定性。

Conclusion: CaT-TTS框架通过语义增强编解码和双阶段生成架构，显著提升了TTS系统的语义理解能力和生成稳定性。

Abstract: Existing Large Language Model (LLM) based autoregressive (AR) text-to-speech
(TTS) systems, while achieving state-of-the-art quality, still face critical
challenges. The foundation of this LLM-based paradigm is the discretization of
the continuous speech waveform into a sequence of discrete tokens by neural
audio codec. However, single codebook modeling is well suited to text LLMs, but
suffers from significant information loss; hierarchical acoustic tokens,
typically generated via Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ), often lack explicit
semantic structure, placing a heavy learning burden on the model. Furthermore,
the autoregressive process is inherently susceptible to error accumulation,
which can degrade generation stability. To address these limitations, we
propose CaT-TTS, a novel framework for robust and semantically-grounded
zero-shot synthesis. First, we introduce S3Codec, a split RVQ codec that
injects explicit linguistic features into its primary codebook via semantic
distillation from a state-of-the-art ASR model, providing a structured
representation that simplifies the learning task. Second, we propose an
``Understand-then-Generate'' dual-Transformer architecture that decouples
comprehension from rendering. An initial ``Understanding'' Transformer models
the cross-modal relationship between text and the audio's semantic tokens to
form a high-level utterance plan. A subsequent ``Generation'' Transformer then
executes this plan, autoregressively synthesizing hierarchical acoustic tokens.
Finally, to enhance generation stability, we introduce Masked Audio Parallel
Inference (MAPI), a nearly parameter-free inference strategy that dynamically
guides the decoding process to mitigate local errors.

Motivation: 方言变异阻碍了被动声学监测中鸟类叫声的自动识别，需要开发能够处理不同地区方言差异的鲁棒识别系统。

Method: 使用TDNN架构，结合实例频率归一化和门控松弛IFN进行频率敏感归一化，采用梯度反转对抗训练学习区域不变嵌入，并实施多级数据增强策略包括波形扰动、Mixup和CycleGAN风格转换。

Result: 系统将跨方言识别准确率比基线TDNN提升了高达20个百分点，同时保持了区域内性能。Grad-CAM和LIME分析显示鲁棒模型聚焦于稳定的谐波频带。

Conclusion: 研究表明轻量级、透明且具有方言弹性的鸟类声音识别是可实现的，为生态学研究提供了有意义的解释。

Abstract: Dialect variation hampers automatic recognition of bird calls collected by
passive acoustic monitoring. We address the problem on DB3V, a three-region,
ten-species corpus of 8-s clips, and propose a deployable framework built on
Time-Delay Neural Networks (TDNNs). Frequency-sensitive normalisation (Instance
Frequency Normalisation and a gated Relaxed-IFN) is paired with
gradient-reversal adversarial training to learn region-invariant embeddings. A
multi-level augmentation scheme combines waveform perturbations, Mixup for rare
classes, and CycleGAN transfer that synthesises Region 2 (Interior
Plains)-style audio, , with Dialect-Calibrated Augmentation (DCA) softly
down-weighting synthetic samples to limit artifacts. The complete system lifts
cross-dialect accuracy by up to twenty percentage points over baseline TDNNs
while preserving in-region performance. Grad-CAM and LIME analyses show that
robust models concentrate on stable harmonic bands, providing ecologically
meaningful explanations. The study demonstrates that lightweight, transparent,
and dialect-resilient bird-sound recognition is attainable.

Motivation: 解决现有图像到音乐生成方法缺乏可解释性、计算资源需求大、训练数据要求高的问题，使普通用户也能使用该技术。

Method: 利用ABC符号连接文本和音乐模态，应用多模态检索增强生成和自优化技术，通过VLM生成音乐动机和注意力图提供文本和图像模态的解释。

Result: 在人类研究和机器评估中，该方法在音乐质量和音乐图像一致性方面优于其他方法，显示出有希望的结果。

Conclusion: 提出的VLM-based I2M框架成功解决了可解释性和计算成本问题，为图像到音乐生成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, Image-to-Music (I2M) generation has garnered significant attention,
with potential applications in fields such as gaming, advertising, and
multi-modal art creation. However, due to the ambiguous and subjective nature
of I2M tasks, most end-to-end methods lack interpretability, leaving users
puzzled about the generation results. Even methods based on emotion mapping
face controversy, as emotion represents only a singular aspect of art.
Additionally, most learning-based methods require substantial computational
resources and large datasets for training, hindering accessibility for common
users. To address these challenges, we propose the first Vision Language Model
(VLM)-based I2M framework that offers high interpretability and low
computational cost. Specifically, we utilize ABC notation to bridge the text
and music modalities, enabling the VLM to generate music using natural
language. We then apply multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and
self-refinement techniques to allow the VLM to produce high-quality music
without external training. Furthermore, we leverage the generated motivations
in text and the attention maps from the VLM to provide explanations for the
generated results in both text and image modalities. To validate our method, we
conduct both human studies and machine evaluations, where our method
outperforms others in terms of music quality and music-image consistency,
indicating promising results. Our code is available at

TL;DR: CSFNet是一个从粗到细的音频-视觉语音分离网络，通过递归语义增强范式提升分离效果，包含粗分离和细分离两阶段，在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖静态视觉表示，未能充分利用视觉信息的潜力。视觉信息提供互补的语义指导，但需要更有效地利用。

Method: 两阶段方法：1) 粗分离阶段从混合音频和视觉输入重建粗略音频波形；2) 细分离阶段将粗音频与视觉流一起输入音频-视觉语音识别模型，通过递归过程产生更具区分性的语义表示。还设计了说话人感知融合块和多范围谱时分离网络。

Result: 在三个基准数据集和两个噪声数据集上的广泛实验表明，CSFNet实现了最先进的性能，具有显著的从粗到细的改进。

Conclusion: 验证了递归语义增强框架的必要性和有效性，通过递归语义增强和跨模态融合显著提升了音频-视觉语音分离性能。

Abstract: Audio-visual speech separation aims to isolate each speaker's clean voice
from mixtures by leveraging visual cues such as lip movements and facial
features. While visual information provides complementary semantic guidance,
existing methods often underexploit its potential by relying on static visual
representations. In this paper, we propose CSFNet, a Coarse-to-Separate-Fine
Network that introduces a recursive semantic enhancement paradigm for more
effective separation. CSFNet operates in two stages: (1) Coarse Separation,
where a first-pass estimation reconstructs a coarse audio waveform from the
mixture and visual input; and (2) Fine Separation, where the coarse audio is
fed back into an audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) model together with the
visual stream. This recursive process produces more discriminative semantic
representations, which are then used to extract refined audio. To further
exploit these semantics, we design a speaker-aware perceptual fusion block to
encode speaker identity across modalities, and a multi-range spectro-temporal
separation network to capture both local and global time-frequency patterns.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and two noisy datasets show
that CSFNet achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, with substantial
coarse-to-fine improvements, validating the necessity and effectiveness of our
recursive semantic enhancement framework.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注静态或单场景设置，无法充分捕捉多说话者、展开事件和异质音频源交互的场景，需要更全面的音频推理评估框架。

Method: 构建包含3000个问答对的MDAR基准测试，链接到多样化音频片段，涵盖5类复杂推理任务和3种问题类型（单选、多选、开放性问题）。

Result: 在26个最先进的音频语言模型上测试，发现它们在复杂推理任务中存在局限性。Qwen2.5-Omni在单选问题上达到76.67%准确率，GPT-4o Audio为68.47%，但GPT-4o Audio在更具挑战性的多选和开放性问题中表现更好。所有模型在三种问题类型中均未达到80%性能。

Conclusion: MDAR揭示了音频推理面临的独特挑战，作为推动音频推理研究发展的基准测试具有重要价值。

Abstract: The ability to reason from audio, including speech, paralinguistic cues,
environmental sounds, and music, is essential for AI agents to interact
effectively in real-world scenarios. Existing benchmarks mainly focus on static
or single-scene settings and do not fully capture scenarios where multiple
speakers, unfolding events, and heterogeneous audio sources interact. To
address these challenges, we introduce MDAR, a benchmark for evaluating models
on complex, multi-scene, and dynamically evolving audio reasoning tasks. MDAR
comprises 3,000 carefully curated question-answer pairs linked to diverse audio
clips, covering five categories of complex reasoning and spanning three
question types. We benchmark 26 state-of-the-art audio language models on MDAR
and observe that they exhibit limitations in complex reasoning tasks. On
single-choice questions, Qwen2.5-Omni (open-source) achieves 76.67% accuracy,
whereas GPT-4o Audio (closed-source) reaches 68.47%; however, GPT-4o Audio
substantially outperforms Qwen2.5-Omni on the more challenging multiple-choice
and open-ended tasks. Across all three question types, no model achieves 80%
performance. These findings underscore the unique challenges posed by MDAR and
its value as a benchmark for advancing audio reasoning research.Code and

activities. Finally, a what-if analysis is conducted to evaluate how the
quantity of products in the store evolves over time. This enables the
identification of an optimal balance between customer purchasing behavior and
supply strategies, helping to prevent both food waste due to oversupply and
product shortages.

Motivation: 物理信息神经网络(PINNs)在求解偏微分方程时对损失权重选择高度敏感，传统方法难以平衡不同损失项，影响训练稳定性和精度。

Method: 提出了两种基于维度分析的权重方案：第一种仅基于可量化项，第二种同时结合可量化与不可量化项，实现更平衡的训练过程。

Result: 在热传导、对流扩散和顶盖驱动腔流等基准测试中，第二种方案相比等权重方法显著提高了稳定性和精度，特别是在高佩克莱特数对流扩散问题中，传统求解器失效时PINNs仍能获得稳定准确的结果。

Conclusion: 所提出的权重方案增强了PINNs在CFD问题中的鲁棒性和泛化能力，为复杂物理问题的求解提供了更可靠的框架。

Abstract: Physics Informed Neural Networks offer a mesh free framework for solving PDEs
but are highly sensitive to loss weight selection. We propose two dimensional
analysis based weighting schemes, one based on quantifiable terms, and another
also incorporating unquantifiable terms for more balanced training. Benchmarks
on heat conduction, convection diffusion, and lid driven cavity flows show that
the second scheme consistently improves stability and accuracy over equal
weighting. Notably, in high Peclet number convection diffusion, where
traditional solvers fail, PINNs with our scheme achieve stable, accurate
predictions, highlighting their robustness and generalizability in CFD
problems.

Motivation: 验证LLM是否能够作为通用实验设计代理进行上下文实验设计，特别是在遗传扰动和分子属性发现任务中

Method: 使用开源和闭源指令调优的LLM，在遗传扰动和分子属性发现任务上进行评估，并提出了LLMNN混合方法

Result: LLM代理对实验反馈不敏感，真实结果与随机标签替换对性能无影响；传统线性bandits和高斯过程优化始终优于LLM代理；LLMNN方法在不同领域都取得了竞争性或更优的性能

Conclusion: 当前开源和闭源的LLM在实践中无法执行上下文实验设计，需要将基于先验的推理与更新后验的批量获取解耦的混合框架

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been proposed as general-purpose
agents for experimental design, with claims that they can perform in-context
experimental design. We evaluate this hypothesis using both open- and
closed-source instruction-tuned LLMs applied to genetic perturbation and
molecular property discovery tasks. We find that LLM-based agents show no
sensitivity to experimental feedback: replacing true outcomes with randomly
permuted labels has no impact on performance. Across benchmarks, classical
methods such as linear bandits and Gaussian process optimization consistently
outperform LLM agents. We further propose a simple hybrid method, LLM-guided
Nearest Neighbour (LLMNN) sampling, that combines LLM prior knowledge with
nearest-neighbor sampling to guide the design of experiments. LLMNN achieves
competitive or superior performance across domains without requiring
significant in-context adaptation. These results suggest that current open- and
closed-source LLMs do not perform in-context experimental design in practice
and highlight the need for hybrid frameworks that decouple prior-based
reasoning from batch acquisition with updated posteriors.

TL;DR: 提出了SpinGPT，这是首个专门针对三人在线扑克格式Spin & Go的大型语言模型，通过两阶段训练在多人不完全信息游戏中取得了有竞争力的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CFR算法在多人游戏中存在计算复杂度指数级增长和纳什均衡不再保证非负结果等限制，限制了其在最受欢迎的锦标赛格式中的应用。受LLM在棋类和外交游戏中的成功启发，希望探索LLM处理多人不完全信息游戏的新途径。

Method: 两阶段训练：1）在32万手高注额专家决策上进行监督微调；2）在27万手求解器生成的手牌上进行强化学习。

Result: SpinGPT在78%的决策中与求解器的行动匹配（容忍准确率）。使用简单的深筹码启发式方法，在3万手牌中对战Slumbot时达到13.4±12.9 BB/100的胜率（95%置信区间）。

Conclusion: 结果表明LLM可能是处理多人不完全信息游戏（如扑克）的新方法。

Abstract: The Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) algorithm and its variants have
enabled the development of pokerbots capable of beating the best human players
in heads-up (1v1) cash games and competing with them in six-player formats.
However, CFR's computational complexity rises exponentially with the number of
players. Furthermore, in games with three or more players, following Nash
equilibrium no longer guarantees a non-losing outcome. These limitations, along
with others, significantly restrict the applicability of CFR to the most
popular formats: tournaments. Motivated by the recent success of Large Language
Models (LLM) in chess and Diplomacy, we present SpinGPT, the first LLM tailored
to Spin & Go, a popular three-player online poker format. SpinGPT is trained in
two stages: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning on 320k high-stakes expert decisions;
(2) Reinforcement Learning on 270k solver-generated hands. Our results show
that SpinGPT matches the solver's actions in 78% of decisions (tolerant
accuracy). With a simple deep-stack heuristic, it achieves 13.4 +/- 12.9 BB/100
versus Slumbot in heads-up over 30,000 hands (95% CI). These results suggest
that LLMs could be a new way to deal with multi-player imperfect-information
games like poker.

### [200] [Learning from Delayed Feedback in Games via Extra Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22426)
*Yuma Fujimoto,Kenshi Abe,Kaito Ariu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究解决了博弈学习中时间延迟反馈的问题，提出了加权乐观跟随正则化领导者算法(WOFTRL)，通过加权预测向量来抵消时间延迟的影响，在乐观权重超过时间延迟时能够实现恒定遗憾和最佳迭代收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 博弈学习中多个智能体独立学习策略会产生优化差异，通常使用OFTRL算法通过预测未来奖励来解决。但过去奖励的观察时间延迟会阻碍预测，即使是单步延迟也会恶化OFTRL的性能。

Method: 提出加权OFTRL算法(WOFTRL)，对OFTRL中下一个奖励的预测向量进行n次加权。直觉是乐观权重可以抵消时间延迟的影响。

Result: 当乐观权重超过时间延迟时，WOFTRL在一般和正规形式博弈中实现恒定遗憾(O(1)-regret)，在多矩阵零和博弈中策略收敛到纳什均衡子序列(最佳迭代收敛)。理论结果得到实验支持。

Conclusion: WOFTRL通过加权预测向量有效解决了博弈学习中的时间延迟问题，在适当条件下能够恢复良好的性能表现。

Abstract: This study raises and addresses the problem of time-delayed feedback in
learning in games. Because learning in games assumes that multiple agents
independently learn their strategies, a discrepancy in optimization often
emerges among the agents. To overcome this discrepancy, the prediction of the
future reward is incorporated into algorithms, typically known as Optimistic
Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (OFTRL). However, the time delay in observing the
past rewards hinders the prediction. Indeed, this study firstly proves that
even a single-step delay worsens the performance of OFTRL from the aspects of
regret and convergence. This study proposes the weighted OFTRL (WOFTRL), where
the prediction vector of the next reward in OFTRL is weighted $n$ times. We
further capture an intuition that the optimistic weight cancels out this time
delay. We prove that when the optimistic weight exceeds the time delay, our
WOFTRL recovers the good performances that the regret is constant
($O(1)$-regret) in general-sum normal-form games, and the strategies converge
to the Nash equilibrium as a subsequence (best-iterate convergence) in
poly-matrix zero-sum games. The theoretical results are supported and
strengthened by our experiments.

TL;DR: NUFILT是一个数据自由的持续模型融合框架，通过零空间过滤和轻量级LoRA适配器实现透明度和保真度，在无需任务数据的情况下融合独立微调模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决数据自由持续模型融合中如何在没有任务数据的情况下确保透明度（不干扰先前任务）和保真度（忠实适应新任务）的挑战。

Method: 提出零空间过滤方法，通过投影器过滤新任务向量中的重叠组件确保透明度，使用轻量级LoRA适配器注入补充任务特定信号实现保真度，采用基于投影的替代损失训练。

Result: 在视觉和NLP基准测试中达到最先进性能，平均准确率比OPCM和WUDI-Merging提高4-7%，减少遗忘并降低计算开销。

Conclusion: NUFILT通过结构替代方法有效连接数据级期望与参数空间优化，在数据自由条件下实现透明和忠实的模型融合。

Abstract: Data-free continual model merging (DFCMM) aims to fuse independently
fine-tuned models into a single backbone that evolves with incoming tasks
without accessing task data. This paper formulate two fundamental desiderata
for DFCMM: transparency, avoiding interference with earlier tasks, and
fidelity, adapting faithfully to each new task. This poses a challenge that
existing approaches fail to address: how to bridge data-level desiderata with
parameter-space optimization to ensure transparency and fidelity in the absence
of task data. To this end, we propose NUFILT (NUll-space FILTering), a
data-free framework that directly links these desiderata to optimization. Our
key observation is that task vectors approximately align with representation
subspaces, providing structural surrogates for enforcing transparency and
fidelity. Accordingly, we design a null-space projector that preserves prior
responses by filtering out overlapping components of new task vectors, thereby
ensuring transparency, and a lightweight LoRA adapter that injects
complementary task-specific signals, enabling fidelity in adapting to new
tasks. The adapter is trained with a projection-based surrogate loss to retain
consistency with previous knowledge while introducing novel directions. This
joint filtering-adaptation process allows the backbone to absorb new knowledge
while retaining existing behaviors, and the updates are finally fused back in a
layer-wise linear fashion without extra parameters or inference cost.
Theoretically, we establish approximate subspace alignment guarantees that
justify null-space filtering. Empirically, NUFILT achieves state-of-the-art
performance with minimal forgetting on both vision and NLP benchmarks,
improving average accuracy by 4-7% over OPCM and WUDI-Merging, while narrowing
the gap to fine-tuning and reducing computation overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为支持未来引力波探测器（如爱因斯坦望远镜）中的牛顿噪声抑制和实时观测控制，需要开发数据驱动的地震预测方法。

Method: 使用基于Transformer的自回归模型，直接从波形数据中学习时间和空间依赖关系，支持单站和阵列输入。

Result: 模型在即时预测窗口内表现良好，随着预测时间延长性能逐渐下降，符合自回归系统的预期行为。

Conclusion: 该方法为数据驱动的地震预测奠定了基础，有助于引力波探测器中的噪声抑制和实时控制。

Abstract: We introduce \textit{SeismoGPT}, a transformer-based model for forecasting
three-component seismic waveforms in the context of future gravitational wave
detectors like the Einstein Telescope. The model is trained in an
autoregressive setting and can operate on both single-station and array-based
inputs. By learning temporal and spatial dependencies directly from waveform
data, SeismoGPT captures realistic ground motion patterns and provides accurate
short-term forecasts. Our results show that the model performs well within the
immediate prediction window and gradually degrades further ahead, as expected
in autoregressive systems. This approach lays the groundwork for data-driven
seismic forecasting that could support Newtonian noise mitigation and real-time
observatory control.

Motivation: 表格基础模型在低资源表格问题上表现出色，但成为难以解释的黑盒且推理成本高。需要一种既能保持性能又具备可解释性的替代方案。

Method: 设计最小工具集让LLM构建、分析和操作决策树，结合先验知识和数据学习创建轻量级决策树。

Result: LLM生成的决策树在低资源表格问题上优于传统CART方法，虽然不如最先进的黑盒模型，但提供可检查偏见的可读推理轨迹。

Conclusion: 基于推理的LLM决策树生成方法提供了可解释的替代方案，允许人工干预纠正偏见和融入领域知识，在性能和可解释性间取得平衡。

Abstract: Tabular foundation models are becoming increasingly popular for low-resource
tabular problems. These models make up for small training datasets by
pretraining on large volumes of synthetic data. The prior knowledge obtained
via pretraining provides the exceptional performance, but the resulting model
becomes a black box that is difficult to interpret and costly to inference. In
this work, we explore an alternative strategy: using reasoning-capable LLMs to
induce decision trees for small tabular datasets in agentic setup. We design a
minimal set of tools for constructing, analyzing and manipulating decision
trees. By using these tools, LLMs combine their prior knowledge with learning
from data to create a lightweight decision tree that outperforms traditional
CART on low-resource tabular problems. While a single decision tree does not
outperform state-of-the-art black box models, it comes with a human-readable
reasoning trace that can be checked for biases and data leaks. Furthermore, the
reasoning-based LLM's creation process allows for additional human input:
correcting biases or incorporating domain-specific intuition that is not
captured in the data.

TL;DR: LANCE提出了一种一次性高阶SVD的低秩激活压缩框架，显著减少设备学习中的内存和计算开销，同时支持持续学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设备端学习需要高效学习能力，但现有激活压缩方法依赖重复低秩分解，计算开销大，且未探索持续学习场景。

Method: 使用一次性高阶SVD获得可重用的低秩子空间进行激活投影，消除重复分解，并通过固定低秩子空间实现持续学习。

Result: 在多个数据集上减少激活存储达250倍，保持与完整反向传播相当的精度；在持续学习基准测试中性能与正交梯度投影方法相当，但内存成本大幅降低。

Conclusion: LANCE为边缘设备上的高效微调和持续学习提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: On-device learning is essential for personalization, privacy, and long-term
adaptation in resource-constrained environments. Achieving this requires
efficient learning, both fine-tuning existing models and continually acquiring
new tasks without catastrophic forgetting. Yet both settings are constrained by
high memory cost of storing activations during backpropagation. Existing
activation compression methods reduce this cost but relying on repeated
low-rank decompositions, introducing computational overhead. Also, such methods
have not been explored for continual learning. We propose LANCE (Low-rank
Activation Compression), a framework that performs one-shot higher-order
Singular Value Decompsoition (SVD) to obtain a reusable low-rank subspace for
activation projection. This eliminates repeated decompositions, reducing both
memory and computation. Moreover, fixed low-rank subspaces further enable
on-device continual learning by allocating tasks to orthogonal subspaces
without storing large task-specific matrices. Experiments show that LANCE
reduces activation storage up to 250$\times$ while maintaining accuracy
comparable to full backpropagation on CIFAR-10/100, Oxford-IIIT Pets,
Flowers102, and CUB-200 datasets. On continual learning benchmarks (Split
CIFAR-100, Split MiniImageNet, 5-Datasets), it achieves performance competitive
with orthogonal gradient projection methods at a fraction of the memory cost.
These results position LANCE as a practical and scalable solution for efficient
fine-tuning and continual learning on edge devices.

Motivation: 传统幂等生成网络需要对抗训练，存在训练不稳定和模式崩溃问题；扩散模型虽然稳定且生成质量高，但计算成本高昂。希望结合两者的优势。

Method: 从预训练扩散模型的分数中蒸馏出幂等模型，无需对抗损失，支持多步采样，可直接在源域操作并实现零样本编辑。

Result: 在CIFAR和CelebA数据集上实现了幂等模型的最先进结果，推理速度比迭代式基于分数的模型更快。

Conclusion: SIGN方法成功地将扩散模型与幂等生成网络结合，提供了稳定训练、快速推理和灵活的质量-效率权衡。

Abstract: Idempotent generative networks (IGNs) are a new line of generative models
based on idempotent mapping to a target manifold. IGNs support both single-and
multi-step generation, allowing for a flexible trade-off between computational
cost and sample quality. But similar to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs),
conventional IGNs require adversarial training and are prone to training
instabilities and mode collapse. Diffusion and score-based models are popular
approaches to generative modeling that iteratively transport samples from one
distribution, usually a Gaussian, to a target data distribution. These models
have gained popularity due to their stable training dynamics and high-fidelity
generation quality. However, this stability and quality come at the cost of
high computational cost, as the data must be transported incrementally along
the entire trajectory. New sampling methods, model distillation, and
consistency models have been developed to reduce the sampling cost and even
perform one-shot sampling from diffusion models. In this work, we unite
diffusion and IGNs by distilling idempotent models from diffusion model scores,
called SIGN. Our proposed method is highly stable and does not require
adversarial losses. We provide a theoretical analysis of our proposed
score-based training methods and empirically show that IGNs can be effectively
distilled from a pre-trained diffusion model, enabling faster inference than
iterative score-based models. SIGNs can perform multi-step sampling, allowing
users to trade off quality for efficiency. These models operate directly on the
source domain; they can project corrupted or alternate distributions back onto
the target manifold, enabling zero-shot editing of inputs. We validate our
models on multiple image datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results for
idempotent models on the CIFAR and CelebA datasets.

Motivation: 在稀疏奖励环境中，标准MARL算法由于缺乏中间奖励反馈而难以有效指导策略学习，这在实际应用中是一个根本性挑战。

Method: 构建了基于偏好的价值分解网络的隐式多智能体奖励学习模型，生成全局和局部奖励信号，并构建双重优势流来为集中式评论家和分散式执行者提供差异化学习目标。利用大语言模型提供偏好标签来增强奖励模型质量。

Result: 在MAMuJoCo和SMACv2等最先进基准测试中的实证评估表明，该方法相比现有基线实现了更优越的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在解决在线MARL中的稀疏奖励挑战方面表现出有效性。

Abstract: We study the problem of online multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in
environments with sparse rewards, where reward feedback is not provided at each
interaction but only revealed at the end of a trajectory. This setting, though
realistic, presents a fundamental challenge: the lack of intermediate rewards
hinders standard MARL algorithms from effectively guiding policy learning. To
address this issue, we propose a novel framework that integrates online inverse
preference learning with multi-agent on-policy optimization into a unified
architecture. At its core, our approach introduces an implicit multi-agent
reward learning model, built upon a preference-based value-decomposition
network, which produces both global and local reward signals. These signals are
further used to construct dual advantage streams, enabling differentiated
learning targets for the centralized critic and decentralized actors. In
addition, we demonstrate how large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to
provide preference labels that enhance the quality of the learned reward model.
Empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art benchmarks, including MAMuJoCo and
SMACv2, show that our method achieves superior performance compared to existing
baselines, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing sparse-reward
challenges in online MARL.

Result: 证明了即使最优估计器也会产生幻觉，并给出了通用数据分布下幻觉率的高概率下界。

Conclusion: 幻觉是生成模型固有的结构性问题，源于损失最小化目标与人类期望输出之间的根本性错配。

Abstract: We formalize hallucinations in generative models as failures to link an
estimate to any plausible cause. Under this interpretation, we show that even
loss-minimizing optimal estimators still hallucinate. We confirm this with a
general high probability lower bound on hallucinate rate for generic data
distributions. This reframes hallucination as structural misalignment between
loss minimization and human-acceptable outputs, and hence estimation errors
induced by miscalibration. Experiments on coin aggregation, open-ended QA, and
text-to-image support our theory.

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) have achieved competitive performance
in text generation, improving their reasoning ability with reinforcement
learning remains an active research area. Here, we introduce d2, a reasoning
framework tailored for masked DLMs. Central to our framework is a new policy
gradient algorithm that relies on properties of masking to accurately estimate
the likelihoods of sampling trajectories. Our estimators trade off computation
for approximation accuracy in an analytically tractable manner, and are
particularly effective for DLMs that support any-order likelihood estimation.
We characterize and study this property in popular DLMs and show that it is key
for efficient diffusion-based reasoning. Empirically, d2 significantly improves
over previous diffusion reasoning frameworks using only RL (without relying on
supervised fine-tuning), and sets a new state-of-the-art performance for DLMs
on logical reasoning tasks (Countdown and Sudoku) and math reasoning benchmarks
(GSM8K and MATH500).

Abstract: Reconstructing subsurface ocean dynamics, such as vertical velocity fields,
from incomplete surface observations poses a critical challenge in Earth
science, a field long hampered by the lack of standardized, analysis-ready
benchmarks. To systematically address this issue and catalyze research, we
first build and release KD48, a high-resolution ocean dynamics benchmark
derived from petascale simulations and curated with expert-driven denoising.
Building on this benchmark, we introduce VISION, a novel reconstruction
paradigm based on Dynamic Prompting designed to tackle the core problem of
missing data in real-world observations. The essence of VISION lies in its
ability to generate a visual prompt on-the-fly from any available subset of
observations, which encodes both data availability and the ocean's physical
state. More importantly, we design a State-conditioned Prompting module that
efficiently injects this prompt into a universal backbone, endowed with
geometry- and scale-aware operators, to guide its adaptive adjustment of
computational strategies. This mechanism enables VISION to precisely handle the
challenges posed by varying input combinations. Extensive experiments on the
KD48 benchmark demonstrate that VISION not only substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art models but also exhibits strong generalization under extreme
data missing scenarios. By providing a high-quality benchmark and a robust
model, our work establishes a solid infrastructure for ocean science research
under data uncertainty. Our codes are available at:

Abstract: With promising empirical performance across a wide range of applications,
synthetic data augmentation appears a viable solution to data scarcity and the
demands of increasingly data-intensive models. Its effectiveness lies in
expanding the training set in a way that reduces estimator variance while
introducing only minimal bias. Controlling this bias is therefore critical:
effective data augmentation should generate diverse samples from the same
underlying distribution as the training set, with minimal shifts. In this
paper, we propose conformal data augmentation, a principled data filtering
framework that leverages the power of conformal prediction to produce diverse
synthetic data while filtering out poor-quality generations with provable risk
control. Our method is simple to implement, requires no access to internal
model logits, nor large-scale model retraining. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach across multiple tasks, including topic
prediction, sentiment analysis, image classification, and fraud detection,
showing consistent performance improvements of up to 40% in F1 score over
unaugmented baselines, and 4% over other filtered augmentation baselines.

Abstract: We study distributed learning in the setting of gradient-free zero-order
optimization and introduce FedZero, a federated zero-order algorithm that
delivers sharp theoretical guarantees. Specifically, FedZero: (1) achieves
near-optimal optimization error bounds with high probability in the federated
convex setting; and (2) in the single-worker regime-where the problem reduces
to the standard zero-order framework, establishes the first high-probability
convergence guarantees for convex zero-order optimization, thereby
strengthening the classical expectation-based results. At its core, FedZero
employs a gradient estimator based on randomization over the $\ell_1$-sphere.
To analyze it, we develop new concentration inequalities for Lipschitz
functions under the uniform measure on the $\ell_1$-sphere, with explicit
constants. These concentration tools are not only central to our
high-probability guarantees but may also be of independent interest.

Abstract: This paper presents a method for modeling transient fluid flow in subsurface
reservoir systems based on the developed neural operator architecture
(TFNO-opt). Reservoir systems are complex dynamic objects with distributed
parameters described by systems of partial differential equations (PDEs).
Traditional numerical methods for modeling such systems, despite their high
accuracy, are characterized by significant time costs for performing
calculations, which limits their applicability in control and decision support
problems. The proposed architecture (TFNO-opt) is based on Fourier neural
operators, which allow approximating PDE solutions in infinite-dimensional
functional spaces, providing invariance to discretization and the possibility
of generalization to various implementations of equations. The developed
modifications are aimed at increasing the accuracy and stability of the trained
neural operator, which is especially important for control problems. These
include adjustable internal time resolution of the integral Fourier operator,
tensor decomposition of parameters in the spectral domain, use of the Sobolev
norm in the error function, and separation of approximation errors and
reconstruction of initial conditions for more accurate reproduction of physical
processes. The effectiveness of the proposed improvements is confirmed by
computational experiments. The practical significance is confirmed by
computational experiments using the example of the problem of hydrodynamic
modeling of an underground gas storage (UGS), where the acceleration of
calculations by six orders of magnitude was achieved, compared to traditional
methods. This opens up new opportunities for the effective control of complex
reservoir systems.

Conclusion: SPEAR通过课程学习和自模仿学习的结合，有效解决了强化学习中探索-利用平衡的挑战，为训练智能体LLMs提供了稳定且高效的框架。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is the dominant paradigm for sharpening strategic
tool use capabilities of LLMs on long-horizon, sparsely-rewarded agent tasks,
yet it faces a fundamental challenge of exploration-exploitation trade-off.
Existing studies stimulate exploration through the lens of policy entropy, but
such mechanical entropy maximization is prone to RL training instability due to
the multi-turn distribution shifting. In this paper, we target the progressive
exploration-exploitation balance under the guidance of the agent own
experiences without succumbing to either entropy collapsing or runaway
divergence. We propose SPEAR, a curriculum-based self-imitation learning (SIL)
recipe for training agentic LLMs. It extends the vanilla SIL framework, where a
replay buffer stores self-generated promising trajectories for off-policy
update, by gradually steering the policy evolution within a well-balanced range
of entropy across stages. Specifically, our approach incorporates a curriculum
to manage the exploration process, utilizing intrinsic rewards to foster
skill-level exploration and facilitating action-level exploration through SIL.
At first, the auxiliary tool call reward plays a critical role in the
accumulation of tool-use skills, enabling broad exposure to the unfamiliar
distributions of the environment feedback with an upward entropy trend. As
training progresses, self-imitation gets strengthened to exploit existing
successful patterns from replayed experiences for comparative action-level
exploration, accelerating solution iteration without unbounded entropy growth.
To further stabilize training, we recalibrate the advantages of experiences in
the replay buffer to address the potential policy drift. Reugularizations such
as the clipping of tokens with high covariance between probability and
advantage are introduced to the trajectory-level entropy control to curb
over-confidence.

TL;DR: GraphPFN是一种基于先验数据拟合网络的节点级预测方法，通过在合成图上预训练增强表格基础模型，实现了在真实图数据集上的最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图基础模型主要依赖手工制作的图特征，限制了学习复杂图特定模式的能力。需要开发能够更好捕捉图结构依赖性的方法。

Method: 设计合成属性图的先验分布，结合多种随机块模型和优先连接过程生成图结构，使用图感知结构化因果模型生成节点属性和目标。在合成图上训练增强的表格基础模型LimiX，加入基于注意力的图邻域聚合层。

Result: 在多达50,000个节点的多样化真实世界图数据集上，GraphPFN表现出强大的上下文学习能力，并在微调后达到最先进的结果，在大多数数据集上优于G2T-FM和从头训练的任务特定GNN。

Conclusion: 在精心设计的先验分布生成的合成图上进行预训练是构建图基础模型的有效策略。

Abstract: Foundation models pretrained on large-scale datasets have transformed such
fields as natural language processing and computer vision, but their
application to graph data remains limited. Recently emerged graph foundation
models, such as G2T-FM, utilize tabular foundation models for graph tasks and
were shown to significantly outperform prior attempts to create GFMs. However,
these models primarily rely on hand-crafted graph features, limiting their
ability to learn complex graph-specific patterns. In this work, we propose
GraphPFN: a prior-data fitted network for node-level prediction. First, we
design a prior distribution of synthetic attributed graphs. For graph structure
generation, we use a novel combination of multiple stochastic block models and
a preferential attachment process. We then apply graph-aware structured causal
models to generate node attributes and targets. This procedure allows us to
efficiently generate a wide range of realistic graph datasets. Then, we augment
the tabular foundation model LimiX with attention-based graph neighborhood
aggregation layers and train it on synthetic graphs sampled from our prior,
allowing the model to capture graph structural dependencies not present in
tabular data. On diverse real-world graph datasets with up to 50,000 nodes,
GraphPFN shows strong in-context learning performance and achieves
state-of-the-art results after finetuning, outperforming both G2T-FM and
task-specific GNNs trained from scratch on most datasets. More broadly, our
work demonstrates that pretraining on synthetic graphs from a well-designed
prior distribution is an effective strategy for building graph foundation
models.

*Arani Roy,Shristi Das Biswas,Kaushik Roy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SlimDiff是一个无需梯度训练、基于激活信息的扩散模型结构压缩框架，通过谱近似方法动态剪枝注意力层和前馈层，在保持生成质量的同时实现35%加速和约1亿参数减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然生成性能优秀，但存在计算开销大的问题。现有效率技术需要微调或重新训练来恢复性能，存在瓶颈。

Method: 将扩散模型压缩重构为谱近似任务，利用去噪时间步的激活协方差定义低秩子空间，在固定压缩预算下指导动态剪枝。采用模块化分解方法处理功能权重组，自适应分配稀疏度。

Result: 相比基线方法实现35%加速和约1亿参数减少，生成质量与未压缩模型相当，仅需约500个校准样本（比先前方法少70倍以上）。

Conclusion: 这是首个无需训练、基于激活指导的扩散模型结构压缩方法，提供了理论清晰性和实际效率。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs), lauded for their generative performance, are
computationally prohibitive due to their billion-scale parameters and iterative
denoising dynamics. Existing efficiency techniques, such as quantization,
timestep reduction, or pruning, offer savings in compute, memory, or runtime
but are strictly bottlenecked by reliance on fine-tuning or retraining to
recover performance. In this work, we introduce SlimDiff, an automated
activation-informed structural compression framework that reduces both
attention and feedforward dimensionalities in DMs, while being entirely
gradient-free. SlimDiff reframes DM compression as a spectral approximation
task, where activation covariances across denoising timesteps define low-rank
subspaces that guide dynamic pruning under a fixed compression budget. This
activation-aware formulation mitigates error accumulation across timesteps by
applying module-wise decompositions over functional weight groups: query--key
interactions, value--output couplings, and feedforward projections, rather than
isolated matrix factorizations, while adaptively allocating sparsity across
modules to respect the non-uniform geometry of diffusion trajectories. SlimDiff
achieves up to 35\% acceleration and $\sim$100M parameter reduction over
baselines, with generation quality on par with uncompressed models without any
backpropagation. Crucially, our approach requires only about 500 calibration
samples, over 70$\times$ fewer than prior methods. To our knowledge, this is
the first closed-form, activation-guided structural compression of DMs that is
entirely training-free, providing both theoretical clarity and practical
efficiency.

TL;DR: 本文提出基于评分标准的奖励机制来解决强化学习微调中的奖励过度优化问题，通过利用离策略示例来改进高奖励区域的奖励规范。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习微调(RFT)经常遭受奖励过度优化问题，即策略模型通过操纵奖励信号获得高分但产生低质量输出。理论分析表明关键在于高奖励尾部的奖励规范错误：无法可靠区分优秀响应和良好响应。

Method: 研究基于评分标准的奖励机制，通过设计能够利用离策略示例同时对其伪影不敏感的评分标准。引入区分优秀和多样化响应的工作流程来获取捕捉高奖励尾部的评分标准。

Result: 实证研究表明基于评分标准的奖励显著缓解了奖励过度优化问题，并实现了有效的LLM后训练改进。

Conclusion: 基于评分标准的奖励机制是解决强化学习微调中奖励过度优化问题的有效方法，能够利用离策略示例改进高奖励区域的奖励规范。

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) often suffers from \emph{reward
over-optimization}, where a policy model hacks the reward signals to achieve
high scores while producing low-quality outputs. Our theoretical analysis shows
that the key lies in reward misspecification at the high-reward tail: the
inability to reliably distinguish Excellent responses from merely Great ones.
This motivate us to focus on the high-reward region. However, such tail
examples are scarce under the base LLM. While off-policy exemplars (e.g. from
stronger models or rewrites) are easier to obtain, naively training on them
yields a misspecified reward for the policy we aim to align. To address this,
we study rubric-based rewards. By design, rubrics can leverage off-policy
examples while remaining insensitive to their artifacts. To elicit rubrics that
capture the high-reward tail, we highlight the importance of distinguishing
among great and diverse responses, and introduce a workflow to implement this
idea. We empirically demonstrate that rubric-based rewards substantially
mitigate reward over-optimization and deliver effective LLM post-training
improvements. Our code can be accessed at

*Micha Livne*

TL;DR: 提出了对比互信息机(cMIM)，通过结合对比学习目标扩展MIM框架，在保留生成保真度的同时提升判别性能，无需数据增强且对批量大小不敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表示学习方法在平衡不同下游任务性能方面存在挑战，MIM虽然能最大化输入与潜在变量间的互信息并促进编码聚类，但在判别任务上表现不足。

Method: cMIM在MIM基础上引入对比目标，施加全局判别结构；提出信息嵌入技术从编码器-解码器模型中提取丰富特征；无需正样本数据增强。

Result: 在视觉和分子基准测试中，cMIM在分类和回归任务上优于MIM和InfoNCE，同时保持竞争力的重建质量。

Conclusion: cMIM作为统一的表示学习框架，有效服务于判别性和生成性应用，推进了表示学习的发展目标。

Abstract: Learning representations that transfer well to diverse downstream tasks
remains a central challenge in representation learning. Existing paradigms --
contrastive learning, self-supervised masking, and denoising auto-encoders --
balance this challenge with different trade-offs. We introduce the {contrastive
Mutual Information Machine} (cMIM), a probabilistic framework that extends the
Mutual Information Machine (MIM) with a contrastive objective. While MIM
maximizes mutual information between inputs and latents and promotes clustering
of codes, it falls short on discriminative tasks. cMIM addresses this gap by
imposing global discriminative structure while retaining MIM's generative
fidelity. Our contributions are threefold. First, we propose cMIM, a
contrastive extension of MIM that removes the need for positive data
augmentation and is substantially less sensitive to batch size than InfoNCE.
Second, we introduce {informative embeddings}, a general technique for
extracting enriched features from encoder-decoder models that boosts
discriminative performance without additional training and applies broadly
beyond MIM. Third, we provide empirical evidence across vision and molecular
benchmarks showing that cMIM outperforms MIM and InfoNCE on classification and
regression tasks while preserving competitive reconstruction quality. These
results position cMIM as a unified framework for representation learning,
advancing the goal of models that serve both discriminative and generative
applications effectively.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DistillKac是一个基于阻尼波动方程和随机Kac表示的快速图像生成器，通过有限速度的概率质量传输实现高质量样本生成，相比扩散模型具有更好的数值稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的反向时间速度可能变得刚性并隐含允许无界传播速度，而Kac动力学强制有限速度传输并产生全局有界的动能，提供更好的数值稳定性。

Method: 使用阻尼波动方程和随机Kac表示，引入速度空间的分类器自由引导，并提出端点蒸馏方法训练学生模型匹配冻结的教师模型。

Result: 实验表明DistillKac能够以极少的函数评估次数生成高质量样本，同时保持有限速度概率流的数值稳定性优势。

Conclusion: DistillKac通过有限速度概率流和端点蒸馏实现了快速稳定的图像生成，在保持高质量的同时显著减少了计算成本。

Abstract: We present DistillKac, a fast image generator that uses the damped wave
equation and its stochastic Kac representation to move probability mass at
finite speed. In contrast to diffusion models whose reverse time velocities can
become stiff and implicitly allow unbounded propagation speed, Kac dynamics
enforce finite speed transport and yield globally bounded kinetic energy.
Building on this structure, we introduce classifier-free guidance in velocity
space that preserves square integrability under mild conditions. We then
propose endpoint only distillation that trains a student to match a frozen
teacher over long intervals. We prove a stability result that promotes
supervision at the endpoints to closeness along the entire path. Experiments
demonstrate DistillKac delivers high quality samples with very few function
evaluations while retaining the numerical stability benefits of finite speed
probability flows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前知识追踪模型主要关注提高预测准确性，但大多数模型在学生选择干扰项时预测错误最多，导致学生错误未被检测到。

Method: 通过捕捉预测不确定性来增强知识追踪模型的能力，证明预测不确定性与模型错误预测之间的关联。

Result: 研究表明知识追踪模型中的不确定性具有信息价值，较大的预测不确定性与模型错误预测相一致。

Conclusion: 不确定性信号在教育学习平台中具有教学实用性，特别适用于资源有限但需要理解学生能力的环境。

Abstract: The main focus of research on Knowledge Tracing (KT) models is on model
developments with the aim of improving predictive accuracy. Most of these
models make the most incorrect predictions when students choose a distractor,
leading to student errors going undetected. We present an approach to add new
capabilities to KT models by capturing predictive uncertainty and demonstrate
that a larger predictive uncertainty aligns with model incorrect predictions.
We show that uncertainty in KT models is informative and that this signal would
be pedagogically useful for application in an educational learning platform
that can be used in a limited resource setting where understanding student
ability is necessary.

*Yuandong Tian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为Li₂的数学框架，用于分析双层非线性网络中的grokking现象，揭示了三个关键阶段：懒惰学习、独立特征学习和交互特征学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然grokking现象已被广泛研究，但仍缺乏数学框架来表征复杂结构化输入中特征如何出现、如何以及何时发生。

Method: 通过分析反向传播梯度G_F的结构，研究网络在训练过程中的三个阶段：懒惰学习阶段G_F随机，独立特征学习阶段每个节点独立学习表示，交互特征学习阶段节点间相互作用学习缺失特征。

Result: 发现独立特征学习阶段遵循能量函数E的梯度上升，局部最大值即为涌现的特征。研究了这些特征的泛化能力、表示能力及其随样本大小的变化。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了权重衰减、学习率和样本大小等超参数在grokking中的作用，提供了记忆和泛化的可证明缩放规律，并解释了Muon等优化器有效性的根本原因。

Abstract: While the phenomenon of grokking, i.e., delayed generalization, has been
studied extensively, it remains an open question whether there is a
mathematical framework to characterize what kind of features emerge, how and in
which conditions it happens from training, for complex structured inputs. We
propose a novel framework, named $\mathbf{Li_2}$, that captures three key
stages for the grokking behavior of 2-layer nonlinear networks: (I) Lazy
learning, (II) independent feature learning and (III) interactive feature
learning, characterized by the structure of backpropagated gradient $G_F$
across layers. In (I), $G_F$ is random, and top layer overfits to random hidden
representation. In (II), the gradient of each node (column of $G_F$) only
depends on its own activation, and thus each hidden node learns their
representation independently from $G_F$, which now carries information about
target labels, thanks to weight decay. Interestingly, the independent dynamics
follows exactly the gradient ascent of an energy function $E$, and its local
maxima are precisely the emerging features. We study whether these local-optima
induced features are generalizable, their representation power, and how they
change on sample size, in group arithmetic tasks. Finally, in (III), we
provably show how hidden nodes interact, and how $G_F$ changes to focus on
missing features that need to be learned. Our study sheds lights on roles
played by key hyperparameters such as weight decay, learning rate and sample
sizes in grokking, leads to provable scaling laws of memorization and
generalization, and reveals the underlying cause why recent optimizers such as
Muon can be effective, from the first principles of gradient dynamics. Our
analysis can be extended to multi-layer architectures.

*Hongyang He,Xinyuan Song,Yangfan He,Zeyu Zhang,Yanshu Li,Haochen You,Lifan Sun,Wenqiao Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRiCo是一个新颖的三元博弈论协同训练框架，通过整合教师、两个学生和一个对抗生成器，重新设计了半监督学习的结构。该框架将SSL建模为三个角色之间的结构化交互，使用互信息而非置信度来选择伪标签，并通过Stackelberg博弈进行优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的协同训练或师生方法存在静态视图交互、不可靠的伪标签以及缺乏困难样本建模等关键限制。TRiCo旨在通过引入三元交互结构来解决这些问题，提供更原则化和可泛化的半监督学习解决方案。

Method: TRiCo包含三个角色：两个在冻结互补表示上训练的学生分类器、一个通过验证反馈自适应调节伪标签选择和损失平衡的元学习教师，以及一个扰动嵌入以发现决策边界弱点的非参数生成器。伪标签基于互信息选择，整个交互过程被形式化为Stackelberg博弈。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、SVHN、STL-10和ImageNet上的广泛实验表明，TRiCo在低标签机制下始终达到最先进的性能，同时保持架构无关性并与冻结的视觉骨干网络兼容。

Conclusion: TRiCo通过引入三元博弈论协同训练框架，为半监督学习提供了一个原则化且可泛化的解决方案，有效解决了现有SSL框架的关键限制，在多个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: We introduce TRiCo, a novel triadic game-theoretic co-training framework that
rethinks the structure of semi-supervised learning by incorporating a teacher,
two students, and an adversarial generator into a unified training paradigm.
Unlike existing co-training or teacher-student approaches, TRiCo formulates SSL
as a structured interaction among three roles: (i) two student classifiers
trained on frozen, complementary representations, (ii) a meta-learned teacher
that adaptively regulates pseudo-label selection and loss balancing via
validation-based feedback, and (iii) a non-parametric generator that perturbs
embeddings to uncover decision boundary weaknesses. Pseudo-labels are selected
based on mutual information rather than confidence, providing a more robust
measure of epistemic uncertainty. This triadic interaction is formalized as a
Stackelberg game, where the teacher leads strategy optimization and students
follow under adversarial perturbations. By addressing key limitations in
existing SSL frameworks, such as static view interactions, unreliable
pseudo-labels, and lack of hard sample modeling, TRiCo provides a principled
and generalizable solution. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, SVHN, STL-10,
and ImageNet demonstrate that TRiCo consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance in low-label regimes, while remaining architecture-agnostic and
compatible with frozen vision backbones.

TL;DR: BRT-Align是一个基于可达性分析的安全框架，将控制理论工具应用于LLM推理过程，通过运行时监控和最小限制性转向机制来防止有害内容生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流的安全方法RLHF在训练阶段有效但推理阶段缺乏安全保障，LLM仍可能生成有害内容，需要推理时的安全保护机制。

Method: 将自回归生成建模为潜在空间中的动态系统，通过后向可达性学习安全价值函数，实现运行时监控和最小限制性转向过滤。

Result: 在多个LLM和毒性基准测试中，BRT-Align比基线方法更准确、更早地检测不安全延续，显著减少有害生成同时保持句子多样性和连贯性。

Conclusion: 可达性分析为推理时LLM安全提供了原则性和实用的基础，能够持续产生更少暴力、粗俗、冒犯和政治偏见的内容。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now ubiquitous in everyday tools, raising
urgent safety concerns about their tendency to generate harmful content. The
dominant safety approach -- reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)
-- effectively shapes model behavior during training but offers no safeguards
at inference time, where unsafe continuations may still arise. We propose
BRT-Align, a reachability-based framework that brings control-theoretic safety
tools to LLM inference. BRT-Align models autoregressive generation as a
dynamical system in latent space and learn a safety value function via backward
reachability, estimating the worst-case evolution of a trajectory. This enables
two complementary mechanisms: (1) a runtime monitor that forecasts unsafe
completions several tokens in advance, and (2) a least-restrictive steering
filter that minimally perturbs latent states to redirect generation away from
unsafe regions. Experiments across multiple LLMs and toxicity benchmarks
demonstrate that BRT-Align provides more accurate and earlier detection of
unsafe continuations than baselines. Moreover, for LLM safety alignment,
BRT-Align substantially reduces unsafe generations while preserving sentence
diversity and coherence. Qualitative results further highlight emergent
alignment properties: BRT-Align consistently produces responses that are less
violent, less profane, less offensive, and less politically biased. Together,
these findings demonstrate that reachability analysis provides a principled and
practical foundation for inference-time LLM safety.

Abstract: Data augmentation is a widely used strategy to improve model robustness and
generalization by enriching training datasets with synthetic examples. While
large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generative capabilities
for this purpose, their applications in high-stakes domains like healthcare
present unique challenges due to the risk of generating clinically incorrect or
misleading information. In this work, we propose a novel query-based model
collaboration framework that integrates expert-level domain knowledge to guide
the augmentation process to preserve critical medical information. Experiments
on clinical prediction tasks demonstrate that our lightweight
collaboration-based approach consistently outperforms existing LLM augmentation
methods while improving safety through reduced factual errors. This framework
addresses the gap between LLM augmentation potential and the safety
requirements of specialized domains.

TL;DR: 本文研究了Transformer语言模型中归纳头（induction heads）如何支持上下文学习，特别是处理具有层次结构的复杂重复模式的能力。研究发现存在自适应归纳头，能够学习在上下文中关注什么，并且这种学习受到揭示潜在上下文的注意力头的支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已知归纳头在Transformer语言模型的上下文学习中起关键作用，但尚不清楚这种机制是否能支持具有层次结构的复杂重复模式的上下文学习。自然语言中存在大量此类情况，需要整合更多上下文线索来预测正确的标记。

Method: 设计了一个合成的上下文学习任务，其中标记以层次依赖关系重复出现。评估了一系列LLM在这些标记序列和自然语言类似物上的表现，并研究了归纳头自身如何在上下文中学习。

Result: 发现了支持预测的自适应归纳头，它们学习在上下文中关注什么。学习受到揭示一组潜在上下文的注意力头的支持，这些上下文决定了不同的标记转换关系。

Conclusion: 不仅证明了LLM具有学习的归纳头，还提供了关于LLM如何在上下文中学习预测高阶重复模式的完整机制解释。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at in-context learning, the ability to use
information provided as context to improve prediction of future tokens.
Induction heads have been argued to play a crucial role for in-context learning
in Transformer Language Models. These attention heads make a token attend to
successors of past occurrences of the same token in the input. This basic
mechanism supports LLMs' ability to copy and predict repeating patterns.
However, it is unclear if this same mechanism can support in-context learning
of more complex repetitive patterns with hierarchical structure. Natural
language is teeming with such cases: The article "the" in English usually
prefaces multiple nouns in a text. When predicting which token succeeds a
particular instance of "the", we need to integrate further contextual cues from
the text to predict the correct noun. If induction heads naively attend to all
past instances of successor tokens of "the" in a context-independent manner,
they cannot support this level of contextual information integration. In this
study, we design a synthetic in-context learning task, where tokens are
repeated with hierarchical dependencies. Here, attending uniformly to all
successor tokens is not sufficient to accurately predict future tokens.
Evaluating a range of LLMs on these token sequences and natural language
analogues, we find adaptive induction heads that support prediction by learning
what to attend to in-context. Next, we investigate how induction heads
themselves learn in-context. We find evidence that learning is supported by
attention heads that uncover a set of latent contexts, determining the
different token transition relationships. Overall, we not only show that LLMs
have induction heads that learn, but offer a complete mechanistic account of
how LLMs learn to predict higher-order repetitive patterns in-context.

<details>

Motivation: LLM自我意识和感知能力的可能性日益受到关注，但测量这些能力的科学仍处于初级阶段，需要开发定量评估方法。

Method: 受非人类动物元认知研究启发，采用两种实验范式测试LLM如何战略性地部署内部状态知识，避免依赖模型自我报告。

Result: 2024年初以来发布的前沿LLM显示出越来越强的元认知能力，包括评估回答事实和推理问题的置信度，以及预测和适当利用自身答案的能力。

Conclusion: LLM具备有限的元认知能力，这些能力具有分辨率限制、情境依赖性，且与人类元认知存在质的差异，模型后训练可能对发展这些能力有重要作用。

Abstract: The possibility of LLM self-awareness and even sentience is gaining
increasing public attention and has major safety and policy implications, but
the science of measuring them is still in a nascent state. Here we introduce a
novel methodology for quantitatively evaluating metacognitive abilities in
LLMs. Taking inspiration from research on metacognition in nonhuman animals,
our approach eschews model self-reports and instead tests to what degree models
can strategically deploy knowledge of internal states. Using two experimental
paradigms, we demonstrate that frontier LLMs introduced since early 2024 show
increasingly strong evidence of certain metacognitive abilities, specifically
the ability to assess and utilize their own confidence in their ability to
answer factual and reasoning questions correctly and the ability to anticipate
what answers they would give and utilize that information appropriately. We
buttress these behavioral findings with an analysis of the token probabilities
returned by the models, which suggests the presence of an upstream internal
signal that could provide the basis for metacognition. We further find that
these abilities 1) are limited in resolution, 2) emerge in context-dependent
manners, and 3) seem to be qualitatively different from those of humans. We
also report intriguing differences across models of similar capabilities,
suggesting that LLM post-training may have a role in developing metacognitive
abilities.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习和自然学习本质上都是选择过程，基于经验估计进行选择时会受到数据采样随机性的影响，导致选择存在不确定性。需要统计工具来为这种不确定性下的选择结果提供理论保证。

Method: 使用集中不等式（如Markov、Chebyshev、Hoeffding、Bernstein等）控制经验估计与真实期望的偏差；在离线学习中应用Occam剃刀、VC分析和PAC-Bayesian分析推导泛化界限；在在线学习中分析不同环境下的遗憾边界。

Result: 开发了一套完整的统计工具集，能够为机器学习中的选择过程提供理论保证，包括控制估计偏差、推导泛化界限和分析在线学习性能。

Conclusion: 本书系统性地提供了处理机器学习中不确定性选择问题的统计工具，涵盖了从基础集中不等式到复杂学习场景的理论保证方法，为机器学习实践提供了坚实的理论基础。

Abstract: Learning, whether natural or artificial, is a process of selection. It starts
with a set of candidate options and selects the more successful ones. In the
case of machine learning the selection is done based on empirical estimates of
prediction accuracy of candidate prediction rules on some data. Due to
randomness of data sampling the empirical estimates are inherently noisy,
leading to selection under uncertainty. The book provides statistical tools to
obtain theoretical guarantees on the outcome of selection under uncertainty. We
start with concentration of measure inequalities, which are the main
statistical instrument for controlling how much an empirical estimate of
expectation of a function deviates from the true expectation. The book covers a
broad range of inequalities, including Markov's, Chebyshev's, Hoeffding's,
Bernstein's, Empirical Bernstein's, Unexpected Bernstein's, kl, and split-kl.
We then study the classical (offline) supervised learning and provide a range
of tools for deriving generalization bounds, including Occam's razor,
Vapnik-Chervonenkis analysis, and PAC-Bayesian analysis. The latter is further
applied to derive generalization guarantees for weighted majority votes. After
covering the offline setting, we turn our attention to online learning. We
present the space of online learning problems characterized by environmental
feedback, environmental resistance, and structural complexity. A common
performance measure in online learning is regret, which compares performance of
an algorithm to performance of the best prediction rule in hindsight, out of a
restricted set of prediction rules. We present tools for deriving regret bounds
in stochastic and adversarial environments, and under full information and
bandit feedback.

Result: 在标准模拟数据集上验证了模型能力，能够建模软粘性状态和随机环境中的过渡，在真实数据集上成功推断出具有多个动态的随机时间序列中的可解释状态。

Conclusion: GDM扩展了可用状态动态的范围，能够更忠实地近似平滑和非平稳的真实动态，在传统方法经常失败的多动态随机时间序列场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Switching dynamical systems can model complicated time series data while
maintaining interpretability by inferring a finite set of dynamics primitives
and explaining different portions of the observed time series with one of these
primitives. However, due to the discrete nature of this set, such models
struggle to capture smooth, variable-speed transitions, as well as stochastic
mixtures of overlapping states, and the inferred dynamics often display
spurious rapid switching on real-world datasets. Here, we propose the Gumbel
Dynamical Model (GDM). First, by introducing a continuous relaxation of
discrete states and a different noise model defined on the relaxed-discrete
state space via the Gumbel distribution, GDM expands the set of available state
dynamics, allowing the model to approximate smoother and non-stationary
ground-truth dynamics more faithfully. Second, the relaxation makes the model
fully differentiable, enabling fast and scalable training with standard
gradient descent methods. We validate our approach on standard simulation
datasets and highlight its ability to model soft, sticky states and transitions
in a stochastic setting. Furthermore, we apply our model to two real-world
datasets, demonstrating its ability to infer interpretable states in stochastic
time series with multiple dynamics, a setting where traditional methods often
fail.

Conclusion: GenUQ为算子学习提供了一种有效的无似然不确定性量化框架，在多个应用场景中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Operator learning is a recently developed generalization of regression to
mappings between functions. It promises to drastically reduce expensive
numerical integration of PDEs to fast evaluations of mappings between
functional states of a system, i.e., surrogate and reduced-order modeling.
Operator learning has already found applications in several areas such as
modeling sea ice, combustion, and atmospheric physics. Recent approaches
towards integrating uncertainty quantification into the operator models have
relied on likelihood based methods to infer parameter distributions from noisy
data. However, stochastic operators may yield actions from which a likelihood
is difficult or impossible to construct. In this paper, we introduce, GenUQ, a
measure-theoretic approach to UQ that avoids constructing a likelihood by
introducing a generative hyper-network model that produces parameter
distributions consistent with observed data. We demonstrate that GenUQ
outperforms other UQ methods in three example problems, recovering a
manufactured operator, learning the solution operator to a stochastic elliptic
PDE, and modeling the failure location of porous steel under tension.

Motivation: 联邦持续学习中，由于数据异构性、通信限制和隐私问题，灾难性遗忘问题更加严重，需要设计有效的解决方案。

Conclusion: FedProTIP通过梯度投影和任务身份预测有效缓解了联邦持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，为分布式设备上的持续学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) enables distributed client devices to
learn from streaming data across diverse and evolving tasks. A major challenge
to continual learning, catastrophic forgetting, is exacerbated in decentralized
settings by the data heterogeneity, constrained communication and privacy
concerns. We propose Federated gradient Projection-based Continual Learning
with Task Identity Prediction (FedProTIP), a novel FCL framework that mitigates
forgetting by projecting client updates onto the orthogonal complement of the
subspace spanned by previously learned representations of the global model.
This projection reduces interference with earlier tasks and preserves
performance across the task sequence. To further address the challenge of
task-agnostic inference, we incorporate a lightweight mechanism that leverages
core bases from prior tasks to predict task identity and dynamically adjust the
global model's outputs. Extensive experiments across standard FCL benchmarks
demonstrate that FedProTIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
in average accuracy, particularly in settings where task identities are a
priori unknown.

Abstract: The study of causal abstractions bridges two integral components of human
intelligence: the ability to determine cause and effect, and the ability to
interpret complex patterns into abstract concepts. Formally, causal abstraction
frameworks define connections between complicated low-level causal models and
simple high-level ones. One major limitation of most existing definitions is
that they are not well-defined when considering lossy abstraction functions in
which multiple low-level interventions can have different effects while mapping
to the same high-level intervention (an assumption called the abstract
invariance condition). In this paper, we introduce a new type of abstractions
called projected abstractions that generalize existing definitions to
accommodate lossy representations. We show how to construct a projected
abstraction from the low-level model and how it translates equivalent
observational, interventional, and counterfactual causal queries from low to
high-level. Given that the true model is rarely available in practice we prove
a new graphical criteria for identifying and estimating high-level causal
queries from limited low-level data. Finally, we experimentally show the
effectiveness of projected abstraction models in high-dimensional image
settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种动态切换训练方法，在ViT-Large模型训练中从全参数训练切换到LoRA，通过用户定义超参数确定切换点，显著减少可训练参数和训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型模型训练资源消耗巨大，且大部分学习发生在训练早期阶段，后期权重变化趋于稳定，可以被低秩矩阵捕获。

Method: 识别部分收敛状态，动态从全参数训练切换到LoRA，为每个模块层分配基于收敛程度的特定秩。

Result: 保持模型准确性的同时，将可训练参数减少到原来的10%，吞吐量提升3倍，每轮平均训练时间减少1.5倍，GPU内存消耗降低20%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡了训练效率和模型性能，为大规模模型训练提供了实用的优化方案。

Abstract: Training large models ranging from millions to billions of parameters is
highly resource-intensive, requiring significant time, compute, and memory. It
is observed that most of the learning (higher change in weights) takes place in
the earlier stage of the training loop. These changes stabilize as training
continues, enabling them to be captured by matrices of a low intrinsic rank.
Therefore, we propose an approach to identify such states of partial
convergence and dynamically switch from full parameter training to Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) on the ViT-Large model. We introduce a flexible approach that
leverages user-defined hyperparameters to determine the switching point and
assign a rank specific to each module layer based on its level of convergence.
Experimental results show that this approach preserves model accuracy while
reducing the number of trainable parameters to 10% of its original size,
resulting in a 3x improvement in throughput, and a 1.5x reduction in average
training time per epoch while also reducing GPU memory consumption by 20%

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种直接从深度学习模型预测分子Hessian矩阵的方法，无需依赖自动微分或有限差分，比传统方法快1-2个数量级，更准确且内存效率更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分子Hessian矩阵在计算化学中至关重要，但计算成本高昂且随系统规模扩展性差，无论是量子力学方法还是神经网络都存在这一问题。

Method: 利用图神经网络消息传递过程中计算得到的不可约表示特征（最高l=2度），构建SE(3)-等变的对称Hessian矩阵。

Result: HIP Hessians在过渡态搜索、几何优化加速、零点能校正和振动分析基准测试中均表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为直接预测Hessian矩阵提供了有效解决方案，具有更好的扩展性和计算效率。

Abstract: Fundamental tasks in computational chemistry, from transition state search to
vibrational analysis, rely on molecular Hessians, which are the second
derivatives of the potential energy. Yet, Hessians are computationally
expensive to calculate and scale poorly with system size, with both quantum
mechanical methods and neural networks. In this work, we demonstrate that
Hessians can be predicted directly from a deep learning model, without relying
on automatic differentiation or finite differences. We observe that one can
construct SE(3)-equivariant, symmetric Hessians from irreducible
representations (irrep) features up to degree $l$=2 computed during message
passing in graph neural networks. This makes HIP Hessians one to two orders of
magnitude faster, more accurate, more memory efficient, easier to train, and
enables more favorable scaling with system size. We validate our predictions
across a wide range of downstream tasks, demonstrating consistently superior
performance for transition state search, accelerated geometry optimization,
zero-point energy corrections, and vibrational analysis benchmarks. We
open-source the HIP codebase and model weights to enable further development of
the direct prediction of Hessians at https://github.com/BurgerAndreas/hip

TL;DR: 提出了BHRA方法，通过分块Hadamard调制解决PEFT方法中全局调制导致的频谱崩溃问题，在保持参数效率的同时实现局部秩放大


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA受限于标称秩，HiRA等Hadamard扩展方法虽然提高了标称秩，但将每个更新与冻结权重矩阵的全局能量模式耦合，限制了性能

Method: 将每个权重矩阵分区，在每个块内独立应用HiRA风格的乘法调制，保持PEFT参数足迹的同时实现局部秩放大

Result: 在8个常识推理任务和2个算术基准测试中，BHRA在匹配参数预算下持续超越强PEFT基线

Conclusion: 块状设计在不同秩预算下保持丰富频谱，缓解了全局调制引起的崩溃，为参数高效微调提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods must be resource-efficient yet
handle heterogeneous reasoning transformations, and classical low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) is constrained by the nominal rank $r$. Hadamard-style
extensions like HiRA raise the nominal rank but couple every update to the
global energy pattern of the frozen weight matrix, while ABBA trades this
inductive bias for fully learned dense intermediates. To address the limitation
of global modulation, we propose Block Hadamard high-Rank Adaptation (BHRA),
which partitions each weight matrix and applies HiRA-style multiplicative
modulation independently within every block, preserving the PEFT parameter
footprint while unlocking localized rank amplification. Our empirical analyses
reveal that this blockwise design maintains rich spectra across rank budgets,
mitigating the collapse induced by global modulation. Across eight commonsense
reasoning tasks and two arithmetic benchmarks with Llama-3.2 1B/3B, Mistral-7B,
and Gemma-2 9B, BHRA consistently surpasses strong PEFT baselines under matched
parameter budgets.

Conclusion: 掩码预训练行为可通过线性回归理论框架直接表征，提出的R²MAE方法简单有效，能强制学习多尺度特征，在多种应用中优于传统掩码策略。

Abstract: Mask-based pretraining has become a cornerstone of modern large-scale models
across language, vision, and recently biology. Despite its empirical success,
its role and limits in learning data representations have been unclear. In this
work, we show that the behavior of mask-based pretraining can be directly
characterized by test risk in high-dimensional minimum-norm ("ridge-less")
linear regression, without relying on further model specifications. Further
analysis of linear models uncovers several novel aspects of mask-based
pretraining. The theoretical framework and its implications have been validated
across diverse neural architectures (including MLPs, CNNs, and Transformers)
applied to both vision and language tasks. Guided by our theory, we propose an
embarrassingly simple yet overlooked pretraining scheme named Randomly Random
Mask AutoEncoding (R$^2$MAE), which enforces capturing multi-scale features
from data and is able to outperform optimal fixed mask ratio settings in our
linear model framework. We implement R$^2$MAE in vision, language, DNA
sequence, and single-cell models, where it consistently outperforms standard
and more complicated masking schemes, leading to improvements for
state-of-the-art models. Our code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统中安全、信任和AGI的概念缺乏严格的数学定义，作者希望通过形式化定义来探讨这些概念之间的根本关系。

Method: 作者定义了：安全（系统从不做出错误声明）、信任（假设系统是安全的）、AGI（AI系统总是匹配或超越人类能力）。通过数学证明展示这些定义之间的不兼容性。

Result: 核心发现：根据这些形式化定义，一个安全且受信任的AI系统不可能是AGI系统。存在某些任务实例，人类可以轻松且可证明地解决，但这样的系统无法解决。

Conclusion: 安全、信任和AGI在严格数学定义下是互不兼容的。该结果与哥德尔不完备定理和图灵停机问题不可判定性证明有相似之处，可视为对这些经典结果的解释。

Abstract: Safety, trust and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) are aspirational
goals in artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and there are several informal
interpretations of these notions. In this paper, we propose strict,
mathematical definitions of safety, trust, and AGI, and demonstrate a
fundamental incompatibility between them. We define safety of a system as the
property that it never makes any false claims, trust as the assumption that the
system is safe, and AGI as the property of an AI system always matching or
exceeding human capability. Our core finding is that -- for our formal
definitions of these notions -- a safe and trusted AI system cannot be an AGI
system: for such a safe, trusted system there are task instances which are
easily and provably solvable by a human but not by the system. We note that we
consider strict mathematical definitions of safety and trust, and it is
possible for real-world deployments to instead rely on alternate, practical
interpretations of these notions. We show our results for program verification,
planning, and graph reachability. Our proofs draw parallels to G\"odel's
incompleteness theorems and Turing's proof of the undecidability of the halting
problem, and can be regarded as interpretations of G\"odel's and Turing's
results.

Conclusion: DriftLite为扩散模型的推理时适应提供了一条原理性、高效的路径。

Abstract: We study inference-time scaling for diffusion models, where the goal is to
adapt a pre-trained model to new target distributions without retraining.
Existing guidance-based methods are simple but introduce bias, while
particle-based corrections suffer from weight degeneracy and high computational
cost. We introduce DriftLite, a lightweight, training-free particle-based
approach that steers the inference dynamics on the fly with provably optimal
stability control. DriftLite exploits a previously unexplored degree of freedom
in the Fokker-Planck equation between the drift and particle potential, and
yields two practical instantiations: Variance- and Energy-Controlling Guidance
(VCG/ECG) for approximating the optimal drift with minimal overhead. Across
Gaussian mixture models, particle systems, and large-scale protein-ligand
co-folding problems, DriftLite consistently reduces variance and improves
sample quality over pure guidance and sequential Monte Carlo baselines. These
results highlight a principled, efficient route toward scalable inference-time
adaptation of diffusion models.

Conclusion: 虽然一般离散模型无法仅从观测数据中识别，但可以描述兼容参数和结构的完整集合，并在温和假设下建立到马尔可夫等价类的可识别性。

Abstract: Existing methods for differentiable structure learning in discrete data
typically assume that the data are generated from specific structural equation
models. However, these assumptions may not align with the true data-generating
process, which limits the general applicability of such methods. Furthermore,
current approaches often ignore the complex dependence structure inherent in
discrete data and consider only linear effects. We propose a differentiable
structure learning framework that is capable of capturing arbitrary
dependencies among discrete variables. We show that although general discrete
models are unidentifiable from purely observational data, it is possible to
characterize the complete set of compatible parameters and structures.
Additionally, we establish identifiability up to Markov equivalence under mild
assumptions. We formulate the learning problem as a single differentiable
optimization task in the most general form, thereby avoiding the unrealistic
simplifications adopted by previous methods. Empirical results demonstrate that
our approach effectively captures complex relationships in discrete data.

Abstract: Partial differential equation (PDE)-governed inverse problems are fundamental
across various scientific and engineering applications; yet they face
significant challenges due to nonlinearity, ill-posedness, and sensitivity to
noise. Here, we introduce a new computational framework, RED-DiffEq, by
integrating physics-driven inversion and data-driven learning. RED-DiffEq
leverages pretrained diffusion models as a regularization mechanism for
PDE-governed inverse problems. We apply RED-DiffEq to solve the full waveform
inversion problem in geophysics, a challenging seismic imaging technique that
seeks to reconstruct high-resolution subsurface velocity models from seismic
measurement data. Our method shows enhanced accuracy and robustness compared to
conventional methods. Additionally, it exhibits strong generalization ability
to more complex velocity models that the diffusion model is not trained on. Our
framework can also be directly applied to diverse PDE-governed inverse

Abstract: Treatment effect estimation is essential for informed decision-making in many
fields such as healthcare, economics, and public policy. While flexible machine
learning models have been widely applied for estimating heterogeneous treatment
effects, quantifying the inherent uncertainty of their point predictions
remains an issue. Recent advancements in conformal prediction address this
limitation by allowing for inexpensive computation, as well as distribution
shifts, while still providing frequentist, finite-sample coverage guarantees
under minimal assumptions for any point-predictor model. This advancement holds
significant potential for improving decision-making in especially high-stakes
environments. In this work, we perform a systematic review regarding conformal
prediction methods for treatment effect estimation and provide for both the
necessary theoretical background. Through a systematic filtering process, we
select and analyze eleven key papers, identifying and describing current
state-of-the-art methods in this area. Based on our findings, we propose
directions for future research.

Abstract: Multimodal Procedural Planning (MPP) aims to generate step-by-step

accurate multimodal plans. To assess plan quality, we design LLM-as-a-judge
protocols for planning accuracy and cross-modal alignment, and further propose
a visual step-reordering task to measure temporal coherence. Experiments on
RECIPEPLAN and WIKIPLAN show that MMPlanner achieves state-of-the-art
performance, improving textual planning by +6.8%, cross-modal alignment by

Conclusion: LoH为神经符号集成提供了一种统一框架，能够灵活结合数据驱动学习和符号知识，同时保持可解释性

Abstract: Neurosymbolic integration (NeSy) blends neural-network learning with symbolic
reasoning. The field can be split between methods injecting hand-crafted rules
into neural models, and methods inducing symbolic rules from data. We introduce
Logic of Hypotheses (LoH), a novel language that unifies these strands,
enabling the flexible integration of data-driven rule learning with symbolic
priors and expert knowledge. LoH extends propositional logic syntax with a
choice operator, which has learnable parameters and selects a subformula from a
pool of options. Using fuzzy logic, formulas in LoH can be directly compiled
into a differentiable computational graph, so the optimal choices can be
learned via backpropagation. This framework subsumes some existing NeSy models,
while adding the possibility of arbitrary degrees of knowledge specification.
Moreover, the use of Goedel fuzzy logic and the recently developed Goedel trick
yields models that can be discretized to hard Boolean-valued functions without
any loss in performance. We provide experimental analysis on such models,
showing strong results on tabular data and on the Visual Tic-Tac-Toe NeSy task,
while producing interpretable decision rules.

*Joshua Salim,Jordan Yu,Xilei Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种新的正则化方法DIM，通过在深度神经网络中强制执行领域知识驱动的单调性约束来防止过拟合，提高模型预测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型由于复杂结构和大量参数容易过拟合，记忆训练数据中的噪声而非学习可泛化的模式

Method: 通过惩罚相对于线性基线的单调性违规来强制执行单调性，建立线性参考、测量单调行为偏差，并将这些测量整合到训练目标中

Result: 在芝加哥网约车数据集和合成数据集上的实验表明，即使适度的单调性约束也能持续提升各种神经网络架构的性能

Conclusion: DIM通过应用领域知识驱动的单调性约束来正则化模型行为并缓解过拟合，从而提升深度神经网络的预测性能

Abstract: While deep learning models excel at predictive tasks, they often overfit due
to their complex structure and large number of parameters, causing them to
memorize training data, including noise, rather than learn patterns that
generalize to new data. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a new
regularization method, i.e., Enforcing Domain-Informed Monotonicity in Deep
Neural Networks (DIM), which maintains domain-informed monotonic relationships
in complex deep learning models to further improve predictions. Specifically,
our method enforces monotonicity by penalizing violations relative to a linear
baseline, effectively encouraging the model to follow expected trends while
preserving its predictive power. We formalize this approach through a
comprehensive mathematical framework that establishes a linear reference,
measures deviations from monotonic behavior, and integrates these measurements
into the training objective. We test and validate the proposed methodology
using a real-world ridesourcing dataset from Chicago and a synthetically
created dataset. Experiments across various neural network architectures show
that even modest monotonicity constraints consistently enhance model
performance. DIM enhances the predictive performance of deep neural networks by
applying domain-informed monotonicity constraints to regularize model behavior
and mitigate overfitting

TL;DR: Neuroprobe是一个用于颅内脑电图(iEEG)解码任务的标准化评估框架，基于BrainTreebank数据集，包含10名受试者40小时的电影观看记录，旨在推动脑机接口和神经基础模型的发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏针对颅内脑电图(iEEG)记录的标准化评估框架，无法有效比较不同建模方法。高分辨率神经数据集需要严谨的基准来区分竞争性建模方法。

Method: 构建Neuroprobe解码任务套件，基于BrainTreebank数据集(40小时iEEG记录，10名受试者)。通过测量每个特征在所有电极位置和时间点上的可解码性，系统分析语言处理的计算过程。

Result: 可视化信息从颞上回流向前额叶皮层的过程，以及从简单听觉特征到复杂语言特征的进展。线性基线模型表现惊人，在许多任务上优于前沿基础模型。

Conclusion: Neuroprobe为神经基础模型提供了严谨的比较框架，促进iEEG基础模型领域的快速发展，代码和排行榜公开可用。

Abstract: High-resolution neural datasets enable foundation models for the next
generation of brain-computer interfaces and neurological treatments. The
community requires rigorous benchmarks to discriminate between competing
modeling approaches, yet no standardized evaluation frameworks exist for
intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings. To address this gap, we present Neuroprobe:
a suite of decoding tasks for studying multi-modal language processing in the
brain. Unlike scalp EEG, intracranial EEG requires invasive surgery to implant
electrodes that record neural activity directly from the brain with minimal
signal distortion. Neuroprobe is built on the BrainTreebank dataset, which
consists of 40 hours of iEEG recordings from 10 human subjects performing a
naturalistic movie viewing task. Neuroprobe serves two critical functions.
First, it is a mine from which neuroscience insights can be drawn. Its high
temporal and spatial resolution allows researchers to systematically determine
when and where computations for each aspect of language processing occur in the
brain by measuring the decodability of each feature across time and all
electrode locations. Using Neuroprobe, we visualize how information flows from
the superior temporal gyrus to the prefrontal cortex, and the progression from
simple auditory features to more complex language features in a purely
data-driven manner. Second, as the field moves toward neural foundation models,
Neuroprobe provides a rigorous framework for comparing competing architectures
and training protocols. We found that the linear baseline is surprisingly
strong, beating frontier foundation models on many tasks. Neuroprobe is
designed with computational efficiency and ease of use in mind. We make the
code for Neuroprobe openly available and maintain a public leaderboard, aiming
to enable rapid progress in the field of iEEG foundation models, at
https://neuroprobe.dev/

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SlotFM是一个可穿戴加速度计基础模型，通过时频槽注意力机制生成多个小嵌入来捕捉不同信号组件，在16个分类和回归下游任务中超越现有自监督方法，平均性能提升4.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型主要关注日常活动分类，限制了其在依赖其他信号特征的更广泛任务中的应用，需要开发能泛化到多样化下游任务的加速度计基础模型。

Method: 使用时频槽注意力机制处理原始信号的时频表示，生成多个小嵌入来捕捉不同信号组件，并引入两个损失正则化器来捕获局部结构和频率模式。

Result: 在16个分类和回归下游任务中，SlotFM在13个任务上优于现有自监督方法，在其余任务上达到可比性能，平均性能提升4.5%。

Conclusion: SlotFM展示了感知基础模型的强泛化能力，能够扩展到标准人类活动识别之外的各种任务。

Abstract: Wearable accelerometers are used for a wide range of applications, such as
gesture recognition, gait analysis, and sports monitoring. Yet most existing
foundation models focus primarily on classifying common daily activities such
as locomotion and exercise, limiting their applicability to the broader range
of tasks that rely on other signal characteristics. We present SlotFM, an
accelerometer foundation model that generalizes across diverse downstream
tasks. SlotFM uses Time-Frequency Slot Attention, an extension of Slot
Attention that processes both time and frequency representations of the raw
signals. It generates multiple small embeddings (slots), each capturing
different signal components, enabling task-specific heads to focus on the most
relevant parts of the data. We also introduce two loss regularizers that
capture local structure and frequency patterns, which improve reconstruction of
fine-grained details and helps the embeddings preserve task-relevant
information. We evaluate SlotFM on 16 classification and regression downstream
tasks that extend beyond standard human activity recognition. It outperforms
existing self-supervised approaches on 13 of these tasks and achieves
comparable results to the best performing approaches on the remaining tasks. On
average, our method yields a 4.5% performance gain, demonstrating strong
generalization for sensing foundation models.

Motivation: 由于K-means聚类问题的组合结构，现有松弛算法在约束可行性和目标最优性之间难以平衡，计算具有严格保证的二阶临界点面临巨大挑战。

Method: 将K-means问题重新表述为子流形上的光滑无约束优化，利用黎曼几何结构，采用二阶立方正则化黎曼牛顿算法，并通过流形分解使每个牛顿子问题能在线性时间内求解。

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法比最先进的一阶非负低秩分解方法收敛速度显著更快，同时达到相似的统计精度。

Conclusion: 提出的黎曼优化框架为K-means聚类提供了高效且具有严格理论保证的二阶算法解决方案。

Abstract: Clustering is a hard discrete optimization problem. Nonconvex approaches such
as low-rank semidefinite programming (SDP) have recently demonstrated promising
statistical and local algorithmic guarantees for cluster recovery. Due to the
combinatorial structure of the $K$-means clustering problem, current relaxation
algorithms struggle to balance their constraint feasibility and objective
optimality, presenting tremendous challenges in computing the second-order
critical points with rigorous guarantees. In this paper, we provide a new
formulation of the $K$-means problem as a smooth unconstrained optimization
over a submanifold and characterize its Riemannian structures to allow it to be
solved using a second-order cubic-regularized Riemannian Newton algorithm. By
factorizing the $K$-means manifold into a product manifold, we show how each
Newton subproblem can be solved in linear time. Our numerical experiments show
that the proposed method converges significantly faster than the
state-of-the-art first-order nonnegative low-rank factorization method, while
achieving similarly optimal statistical accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前馈神经网络内部逻辑的重要部分体现在隐藏层神经元的激活状态中，需要自动提取这些状态来形式化地描述网络属性。

Method: 基于神经元激活状态（数值或开/关状态）提取规则作为前提条件，这些规则表示隐藏层中捕获的网络属性，能够推导出期望的输出行为。

Result: 展示了工具在不同类型模型和输出属性上的应用，包括推断和证明神经网络的正式解释、组合验证、运行时监控、修复等应用场景。

Conclusion: Prophecy在大规模视觉语言模型时代具有重要潜力，能够自动推断神经网络的形式化属性，支持多种应用场景。

Abstract: We present Prophecy, a tool for automatically inferring formal properties of
feed-forward neural networks. Prophecy is based on the observation that a
significant part of the logic of feed-forward networks is captured in the
activation status of the neurons at inner layers. Prophecy works by extracting
rules based on neuron activations (values or on/off statuses) as preconditions
that imply certain desirable output property, e.g., the prediction being a
certain class. These rules represent network properties captured in the hidden
layers that imply the desired output behavior. We present the architecture of
the tool, highlight its features and demonstrate its usage on different types
of models and output properties. We present an overview of its applications,
such as inferring and proving formal explanations of neural networks,
compositional verification, run-time monitoring, repair, and others. We also
show novel results highlighting its potential in the era of large
vision-language models.

TL;DR: SpecMER是一种通过k-mer引导的推测解码框架，在蛋白质序列生成中结合生物先验知识，在保持推测解码效率的同时显著提升序列的生物学合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在蛋白质工程中面临生成延迟问题，而传统的推测解码方法由于忽略蛋白质的结构和功能约束，导致生成序列缺乏生物学合理性。

Method: 使用从多序列比对中提取的k-mer基序，结合生物、结构和功能先验，并行评分候选序列并选择最符合已知生物模式的序列。

Result: SpecMER相比标准自回归解码实现了24-32%的加速，同时具有更高的接受率和改进的序列似然性。

Conclusion: SpecMER成功地将生物先验知识整合到推测解码中，在保持效率的同时显著提升了生成蛋白质序列的生物学合理性。

Abstract: Autoregressive models have transformed protein engineering by enabling the
generation of novel protein sequences beyond those found in nature. However,
their sequential inference introduces significant latency, limiting their
utility in high-throughput protein screening. Speculative decoding accelerates
generation by employing a lightweight draft model to sample tokens, which a
larger target model then verifies and refines. Yet, in protein sequence
generation, draft models are typically agnostic to the structural and
functional constraints of the target protein, leading to biologically
implausible outputs and a shift in the likelihood distribution of generated
sequences. We introduce SpecMER (Speculative Decoding via k-mer Guidance), a
novel framework that incorporates biological, structural, and functional priors
using k-mer motifs extracted from multiple sequence alignments. By scoring
candidate sequences in parallel and selecting those most consistent with known
biological patterns, SpecMER significantly improves sequence plausibility while
retaining the efficiency of speculative decoding. SpecMER achieves 24-32%
speedup over standard autoregressive decoding, along with higher acceptance
rates and improved sequence likelihoods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了三种正交改进方法来提升仅使用PPG信号的心脏骤停预测系统：时间-事件建模、患者身份不变性特征学习、以及基于预训练辅助网络的伪标签回归。这些方法将24小时时间平均AUC从0.74提升到0.78-0.80范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于PPG的生理基础模型（如PPG-GPT）虽然能够预测心脏骤停等关键事件，但其强大表示能力在数据/标签稀缺的下游任务中尚未得到充分利用。

Method: 1. 时间-事件建模：通过简单回归到事件发生时间或精细离散生存建模
2. 患者身份不变性：训练大规模去识别生物识别模型（p-vector），对抗性地消除可能导致过拟合的患者身份线索
3. 伪标签回归：使用预训练辅助网络生成伪连续估计作为目标，丰富心脏骤停波形标签
4. 多任务学习：使用PCGrad优化技术缓解竞争损失间的高梯度冲突

Result: 提出的方法独立地将24小时时间平均AUC从0.74提升到0.78-0.80范围，主要改善了较长时域的预测性能，在事件临近时仅有最小程度的性能下降。

Conclusion: 通过三种正交改进方法，显著提升了仅使用PPG信号的心脏骤停预测系统的性能，特别是在数据稀缺情况下，推动了早期预警系统的研究进展。

Abstract: High-frequency physiological waveform modality offers deep, real-time
insights into patient status. Recently, physiological foundation models based
on Photoplethysmography (PPG), such as PPG-GPT, have been shown to predict
critical events, including Cardiac Arrest (CA). However, their powerful
representation still needs to be leveraged suitably, especially when the
downstream data/label is scarce. We offer three orthogonal improvements to
improve PPG-only CA systems by using minimal auxiliary information. First, we
propose to use time-to-event modeling, either through simple regression to the
event onset time or by pursuing fine-grained discrete survival modeling.
Second, we encourage the model to learn CA-focused features by making them
patient-identity invariant. This is achieved by first training the
largest-scale de-identified biometric identification model, referred to as the
p-vector, and subsequently using it adversarially to deconfound cues, such as
person identity, that may cause overfitting through memorization. Third, we
propose regression on the pseudo-lab values generated by pre-trained auxiliary
estimator networks. This is crucial since true blood lab measurements, such as
lactate, sodium, troponin, and potassium, are collected sparingly. Via
zero-shot prediction, the auxiliary networks can enrich cardiac arrest waveform
labels and generate pseudo-continuous estimates as targets. Our proposals can
independently improve the 24-hour time-averaged AUC from the 0.74 to the
0.78-0.80 range. We primarily improve over longer time horizons with minimal
degradation near the event, thus pushing the Early Warning System research.
Finally, we pursue multi-task formulation and diagnose it with a high gradient
conflict rate among competing losses, which we alleviate via the PCGrad
optimization technique.

Result: EIN相比标准图神经网络模型具有足够高的预测性能，并能通过选择的子图进行后验分析。

Conclusion: EIN方法成功平衡了判别能力和可解释性，为图级别预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In the graph-level prediction task (predict a label for a given graph), the
information contained in subgraphs of the input graph plays a key role. In this
paper, we propose Exact subgraph Isomorphism Network (EIN), which combines the
exact subgraph enumeration, neural network, and a sparse regularization. In
general, building a graph-level prediction model achieving high discriminative
ability along with interpretability is still a challenging problem. Our
combination of the subgraph enumeration and neural network contributes to high
discriminative ability about the subgraph structure of the input graph.
Further, the sparse regularization in EIN enables us 1) to derive an effective
pruning strategy that mitigates computational difficulty of the enumeration
while maintaining the prediction performance, and 2) to identify important
subgraphs that contributes to high interpretability. We empirically show that
EIN has sufficiently high prediction performance compared with standard graph
neural network models, and also, we show examples of post-hoc analysis based on
the selected subgraphs.

Abstract: Understanding urban human mobility patterns at various spatial levels is
essential for social science. This study presents a machine learning framework
to downscale origin-destination (OD) taxi trips flows in New York City from a
larger spatial unit to a smaller spatial unit. First, correlations between OD
trips and demographic, socioeconomic, and commuting characteristics are
developed using four models: Linear Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF),
Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Networks (NN). Second, a
perturbation-based sensitivity analysis is applied to interpret variable
importance for nonlinear models. The results show that the linear regression
model failed to capture the complex variable interactions. While NN performs
best with the training and testing datasets, SVM shows the best generalization
ability in downscaling performance. The methodology presented in this study
provides both analytical advancement and practical applications to improve
transportation services and urban development.

Conclusion: PQFed在个性化联邦学习设置中具有可扩展性和有效性，能够通过早期质量控制和客户端选择策略改善模型性能。

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training without sharing raw
data, but data heterogeneity consistently challenges the performance of the
global model. Traditional optimization methods often rely on collaborative
global model training involving all clients, followed by local adaptation to
improve individual performance. In this work, we focus on early-stage quality
control and propose PQFed, a novel privacy-preserving personalized federated
learning framework that designs customized training strategies for each client
prior to the federated training process. PQFed extracts representative features
from each client's raw data and applies clustering techniques to estimate
inter-client dataset similarity. Based on these similarity estimates, the
framework implements a client selection strategy that enables each client to
collaborate with others who have compatible data distributions. We evaluate
PQFed on two benchmark datasets, CIFAR-10 and MNIST, integrated with three
existing federated learning algorithms. Experimental results show that PQFed
consistently improves the target client's model performance, even with a
limited number of participants. We further benchmark PQFed against a baseline
cluster-based algorithm, IFCA, and observe that PQFed also achieves better
performance in low-participation scenarios. These findings highlight PQFed's
scalability and effectiveness in personalized federated learning settings.

Conclusion: 该框架为并行化序列模型提供了更清晰的理论基础，并为高效可扩展计算指明了新的方向。

Abstract: Harnessing parallelism in seemingly sequential models is a central challenge
for modern machine learning. Several approaches have been proposed for
evaluating sequential processes in parallel using fixed-point methods, like
Newton, Picard, and Jacobi iterations. In this work, we show that these methods
can be understood within a common framework based on linear dynamical systems
(LDSs), where different iteration schemes arise naturally as approximate
linearizations of a nonlinear recursion. This unifying view highlights shared
principles behind these techniques and clarifies when particular fixed-point
methods are most likely to be effective. By bridging diverse algorithms through
the language of LDSs, our framework provides a clearer theoretical foundation
for parallelizing sequential models and points toward new opportunities for
efficient and scalable computation.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验证明了所提出方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该信息论方法能够有效处理双层贝叶斯优化问题，为复杂嵌套优化结构提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: A bilevel optimization problem consists of two optimization problems nested
as an upper- and a lower-level problem, in which the optimality of the
lower-level problem defines a constraint for the upper-level problem. This
paper considers Bayesian optimization (BO) for the case that both the upper-
and lower-levels involve expensive black-box functions. Because of its nested
structure, bilevel optimization has a complex problem definition and, compared
with other standard extensions of BO such as multi-objective or constraint
settings, it has not been widely studied. We propose an information-theoretic
approach that considers the information gain of both the upper- and
lower-optimal solutions and values. This enables us to define a unified
criterion that measures the benefit for both level problems, simultaneously.
Further, we also show a practical lower bound based approach to evaluating the
information gain. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
method through several benchmark datasets.

Motivation: 在真实世界视觉环境中，由于感知限制，通常无法获得精确的位置信息来设计传统基于距离的奖励函数。

Result: 在复杂长视野操作任务上的实验表明，ReLAM显著加速学习并实现优于现有方法的性能。

Conclusion: ReLAM通过自动生成结构化奖励，有效解决了视觉强化学习中奖励设计的挑战，提高了学习效率和性能。

Abstract: Reward design remains a critical bottleneck in visual reinforcement learning
(RL) for robotic manipulation. In simulated environments, rewards are
conventionally designed based on the distance to a target position. However,
such precise positional information is often unavailable in real-world visual
settings due to sensory and perceptual limitations. In this study, we propose a
method that implicitly infers spatial distances through keypoints extracted
from images. Building on this, we introduce Reward Learning with Anticipation
Model (ReLAM), a novel framework that automatically generates dense, structured
rewards from action-free video demonstrations. ReLAM first learns an
anticipation model that serves as a planner and proposes intermediate
keypoint-based subgoals on the optimal path to the final goal, creating a
structured learning curriculum directly aligned with the task's geometric
objectives. Based on the anticipated subgoals, a continuous reward signal is
provided to train a low-level, goal-conditioned policy under the hierarchical
reinforcement learning (HRL) framework with provable sub-optimality bound.
Extensive experiments on complex, long-horizon manipulation tasks show that
ReLAM significantly accelerates learning and achieves superior performance
compared to state-of-the-art methods.

existing methods. To address these limitations, we develop an interpretable
spatio-temporal graph neural network framework to predict future AD
progression, leveraging dual Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) to model
the irregularly-sampled longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) data. We validate our approach on two independent cohorts, including the
Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-3) and the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our framework effectively learns sparse
regional and connective importance probabilities, enabling the identification
of key brain circuit abnormalities associated with disease progression.
Notably, we detect the parahippocampal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and parietal
lobule as salient regions, with significant disruptions in the ventral
attention, dorsal attention, and default mode networks. These abnormalities
correlate strongly with longitudinal AD-related clinical symptoms. Moreover,
our interpretability strategy reveals both established and novel neural
systems-level and sex-specific biomarkers, offering new insights into the
neurobiological mechanisms underlying AD progression. Our findings highlight
the potential of spatio-temporal graph-based learning for early, individualized
prediction of AD progression, even in the context of irregularly-sampled
longitudinal imaging data.

TL;DR: POLO是一个基于大语言模型的药物先导化合物优化框架，通过偏好引导的多轮优化策略，在有限评估次数下实现高效的分子性质优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统药物先导化合物优化方法样本效率低，现有LLM方法未能充分利用迭代优化过程的特性，需要一种能够从完整优化轨迹中学习的方法。

Method: 提出POLO框架，核心是偏好引导策略优化算法，通过轨迹级优化和轮级偏好学习的双重学习机制，从中间评估中提取学习信号。

Result: 在单属性任务中达到84%的平均成功率（比基线好2.3倍），多属性任务中达到50%成功率，仅需500次评估。

Conclusion: POLO通过充分利用昂贵的评估调用，显著提升了分子优化的样本效率，推进了该领域的技术水平。

Abstract: Lead optimization in drug discovery requires efficiently navigating vast
chemical space through iterative cycles to enhance molecular properties while
preserving structural similarity to the original lead compound. Despite recent
advances, traditional optimization methods struggle with sample
efficiency-achieving good optimization performance with limited oracle
evaluations. Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a promising approach through
their in-context learning and instruction following capabilities, which align
naturally with these iterative processes. However, existing LLM-based methods
fail to leverage this strength, treating each optimization step independently.
To address this, we present POLO (Preference-guided multi-turn Optimization for
Lead Optimization), which enables LLMs to learn from complete optimization
trajectories rather than isolated steps. At its core, POLO introduces
Preference-Guided Policy Optimization (PGPO), a novel reinforcement learning
algorithm that extracts learning signals at two complementary levels:
trajectory-level optimization reinforces successful strategies, while
turn-level preference learning provides dense comparative feedback by ranking
intermediate molecules within each trajectory. Through this dual-level learning
from intermediate evaluation, POLO achieves superior sample efficiency by fully
exploiting each costly oracle call. Extensive experiments demonstrate that POLO
achieves 84% average success rate on single-property tasks (2.3x better than
baselines) and 50% on multi-property tasks using only 500 oracle evaluations,
significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in sample-efficient molecular
optimization.

Motivation: 现有脑图学习方法难以选择性学习疾病相关知识，导致参数和计算成本过高，限制了实际临床应用

Method: 包含病理模式过滤器提取高度疾病相关子图构建PathoGraph，以及病理特征蒸馏模块减少疾病无关噪声特征并增强病理特征

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，BrainPoG在模型性能和计算效率方面均表现出优越性

Conclusion: BrainPoG能够专门学习信息丰富的疾病相关知识，避免无关信息，实现高效的脑图学习

Abstract: Brain graph learning has demonstrated significant achievements in the fields
of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. However, existing methods struggle
to selectively learn disease-related knowledge, leading to heavy parameters and
computational costs. This challenge diminishes their efficiency, as well as
limits their practicality for real-world clinical applications. To this end, we
propose a lightweight Brain PathoGraph Learning (BrainPoG) model that enables
efficient brain graph learning by pathological pattern filtering and
pathological feature distillation. Specifically, BrainPoG first contains a
filter to extract the pathological pattern formulated by highly
disease-relevant subgraphs, achieving graph pruning and lesion localization. A
PathoGraph is therefore constructed by dropping less disease-relevant subgraphs
from the whole brain graph. Afterwards, a pathological feature distillation
module is designed to reduce disease-irrelevant noise features and enhance
pathological features of each node in the PathoGraph. BrainPoG can exclusively
learn informative disease-related knowledge while avoiding less relevant
information, achieving efficient brain graph learning. Extensive experiments on
four benchmark datasets demonstrate that BrainPoG exhibits superiority in both
model performance and computational efficiency across various brain disease
detection tasks.

TL;DR: HyperCore是一个针对噪声环境的鲁棒自适应核心集选择框架，利用轻量级超球面模型和Youden's J统计量自动选择剪枝阈值，无需超参数调优，在噪声和低数据场景下优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有核心集选择方法通常忽略标注错误且需要固定剪枝比例，在真实场景中不实用。

Method: 使用每类轻量级超球面模型，将类内样本嵌入到超球面中心附近，基于距离自然分离类外样本，通过Youden's J统计量自适应选择剪枝阈值。

Result: 在噪声和低数据场景下持续超越最先进的核心集选择方法，有效丢弃错误标注和模糊点。

Conclusion: HyperCore能产生紧凑且信息丰富的子集，适用于可扩展和无噪声学习。

Abstract: The goal of coreset selection methods is to identify representative subsets
of datasets for efficient model training. Yet, existing methods often ignore
the possibility of annotation errors and require fixed pruning ratios, making
them impractical in real-world settings. We present HyperCore, a robust and
adaptive coreset selection framework designed explicitly for noisy
environments. HyperCore leverages lightweight hypersphere models learned per
class, embedding in-class samples close to a hypersphere center while naturally
segregating out-of-class samples based on their distance. By using Youden's J
statistic, HyperCore can adaptively select pruning thresholds, enabling
automatic, noise-aware data pruning without hyperparameter tuning. Our
experiments reveal that HyperCore consistently surpasses state-of-the-art
coreset selection methods, especially under noisy and low-data regimes.
HyperCore effectively discards mislabeled and ambiguous points, yielding
compact yet highly informative subsets suitable for scalable and noise-free
learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有核心集选择方法需要在整个数据集上计算昂贵的训练信号，这违背了核心集选择的目的。

Method: 提出统一的子模覆盖和密度目标，基于闭式解的采样策略，通过单一超参数控制覆盖范围。

Result: 在高剪枝率下显著优于基于训练的方法，计算开销大幅降低，对标签噪声具有更强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SubZeroCore提供了一种高效、可扩展的核心集选择方案，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: The goal of coreset selection is to identify representative subsets of
datasets for efficient model training. Yet, existing approaches paradoxically
require expensive training-based signals, e.g., gradients, decision boundary
estimates or forgetting counts, computed over the entire dataset prior to
pruning, which undermines their very purpose by requiring training on samples
they aim to avoid. We introduce SubZeroCore, a novel, training-free coreset
selection method that integrates submodular coverage and density into a single,
unified objective. To achieve this, we introduce a sampling strategy based on a
closed-form solution to optimally balance these objectives, guided by a single
hyperparameter that explicitly controls the desired coverage for local density
measures. Despite no training, extensive evaluations show that SubZeroCore
matches training-based baselines and significantly outperforms them at high
pruning rates, while dramatically reducing computational overhead. SubZeroCore
also demonstrates superior robustness to label noise, highlighting its
practical effectiveness and scalability for real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出基于神经场的4DVAR重新参数化方法，将时空状态表示为神经网络参数化的连续函数，实现并行时间优化，降低计算成本并提高稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统4DVAR成本函数难以优化且计算密集，需要更高效的数据同化方法。

Method: 使用神经网络参数化时空状态，通过物理约束损失函数直接融入物理规律，实现并行时间优化。

Result: 在二维不可压缩Navier-Stokes方程上测试，相比基线4DVAR产生更稳定的初始条件估计，无虚假振荡。

Conclusion: 该方法无需地面真实状态或再分析数据，在参考信息有限的情况下具有更广泛适用性。

Abstract: Four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4DVAR) is a cornerstone of
numerical weather prediction, but its cost function is difficult to optimize
and computationally intensive. We propose a neural field-based reformulation in
which the full spatiotemporal state is represented as a continuous function
parameterized by a neural network. This reparameterization removes the
time-sequential dependency of classical 4DVAR, enabling parallel-in-time
optimization in parameter space. Physical constraints are incorporated directly
through a physics-informed loss, simplifying implementation and reducing
computational cost. We evaluate the method on the two-dimensional
incompressible Navier--Stokes equations with Kolmogorov forcing. Compared to a
baseline 4DVAR implementation, the neural reparameterized variants produce more
stable initial condition estimates without spurious oscillations. Notably,
unlike most machine learning-based approaches, our framework does not require
access to ground-truth states or reanalysis data, broadening its applicability
to settings with limited reference information.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多发性硬化症患者常抱怨手部灵巧性和认知疲劳问题，但损伤往往微妙难以检测。研究旨在发现解释认知疲劳的脑活动生物标志物，为未来脑刺激治疗提供靶点。

Method: 招募15名无手部、活动或认知障碍的MS患者和12名匹配对照，完成单任务和双任务手部灵巧测试，使用fNIRS测量双侧前额叶和感觉运动皮层活动，采用机器学习框架分析数据。

Result: K-近邻分类器在单任务中准确率达75.0%，双任务中66.7%。XAI显示顶下小叶/角回和中央前回是最重要脑区，MS组活动抑制且神经血管反应较慢。脱氧血红蛋白比氧合血红蛋白更具预测性。

Conclusion: 这种非常规的fNIRS数据分析方法揭示了新的脑活动生物标志物，有助于开发个性化脑刺激靶点。

Abstract: People with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) complain of problems with hand dexterity
and cognitive fatigue. However, in many cases, impairments are subtle and
difficult to detect. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a
non-invasive neuroimaging technique that measures brain hemodynamic responses
during cognitive or motor tasks. We aimed to detect brain activity biomarkers
that could explain subjective reports of cognitive fatigue while completing
dexterous tasks and provide targets for future brain stimulation treatments. We
recruited 15 people with MS who did not have a hand (Nine Hole Peg Test
[NHPT]), mobility, or cognitive impairment, and 12 age- and sex-matched
controls. Participants completed two types of hand dexterity tasks with their
dominant hand, single task and dual task (NHPT while holding a ball between the
fifth finger and hypothenar eminence of the same hand). We analyzed fNIRS data
(oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin levels) using a machine learning
framework to classify MS patients from controls based on their brain activation
patterns in bilateral prefrontal and sensorimotor cortices. The K-Nearest
Neighbor classifier achieved an accuracy of 75.0% for single manual dexterity
tasks and 66.7% for the more complex dual manual dexterity tasks. Using XAI, we
found that the most important brain regions contributing to the machine
learning model were the supramarginal/angular gyri and the precentral gyrus
(sensory integration and motor regions) of the ipsilateral hemisphere, with
suppressed activity and slower neurovascular response in the MS group. During
both tasks, deoxygenated hemoglobin levels were better predictors than the
conventional measure of oxygenated hemoglobin. This nonconventional method of
fNIRS data analysis revealed novel brain activity biomarkers that can help
develop personalized brain stimulation targets.

TL;DR: 本文提出了有效信息准则(EIC)，通过评估公式在数值计算中的稳定性来衡量其结构合理性，从而提升符号回归方法发现的公式的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有符号回归方法仅使用复杂度指标作为可解释性的代理，忽略了公式的内部数学结构，导致发现的公式虽然形式紧凑但难以分析和解释。

Method: 受物理公式在有限计算精度下通常数值稳定的观察启发，将公式视为具有特定内部结构的信息处理系统，通过显著数字损失或舍入噪声放大来识别不合理结构。

Result: 结合EIC改进搜索式符号回归算法在Pareto前沿的性能，减少结果中的不合理结构；结合生成式算法将预训练所需样本减少2-4倍；与108位人类专家对公式可解释性偏好的吻合度达70.2%。

Conclusion: EIC通过测量公式中的不合理结构，实际上反映了公式的可解释性，为符号回归提供了更准确的可解释性评估标准。

Abstract: Symbolic regression discovers accurate and interpretable formulas to describe
given data, thereby providing scientific insights for domain experts and
promoting scientific discovery. However, existing symbolic regression methods
often use complexity metrics as a proxy for interoperability, which only
considers the size of the formula but ignores its internal mathematical
structure. Therefore, while they can discover formulas with compact forms, the
discovered formulas often have structures that are difficult to analyze or
interpret mathematically. In this work, inspired by the observation that
physical formulas are typically numerically stable under limited calculation
precision, we propose the Effective Information Criterion (EIC). It treats
formulas as information processing systems with specific internal structures
and identifies the unreasonable structure in them by the loss of significant
digits or the amplification of rounding noise as data flows through the system.
We find that this criterion reveals the gap between the structural rationality
of models discovered by existing symbolic regression algorithms and real-world
physical formulas. Combining EIC with various search-based symbolic regression
algorithms improves their performance on the Pareto frontier and reduces the
irrational structure in the results. Combining EIC with generative-based
algorithms reduces the number of samples required for pre-training, improving
sample efficiency by 2~4 times. Finally, for different formulas with similar
accuracy and complexity, EIC shows a 70.2% agreement with 108 human experts'
preferences for formula interpretability, demonstrating that EIC, by measuring
the unreasonable structures in formulas, actually reflects the formula's
interpretability.

Motivation: GRPO在提升大语言模型推理能力方面潜力巨大，但实际部署受到训练过程过慢的限制，主要瓶颈在于每个查询需要自回归生成多个响应，计算开销巨大。

Method: 提出并发感知推测解码框架，根据实时并发水平动态调整草稿和验证策略；引入在线草稿学习机制，使草稿模型能够利用目标模型的反馈信号持续适应。

Result: 在多个数学推理数据集和模型上的实验结果表明，该方法实现了2.35倍到2.72倍的端到端加速，显著超越了基线方法的效率。

Conclusion: 所提出的并发感知推测解码和在线草稿学习机制有效解决了GRPO训练中的性能瓶颈，显著提升了训练效率，为实际部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Group relative policy optimization (GRPO) has demonstrated significant
potential in improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) via reinforcement learning. However, its practical deployment is impeded
by an excessively slow training process, primarily attributed to the
computationally intensive autoregressive generation of multiple responses per
query, which makes the generation phase the primary performance bottleneck.
Although speculative decoding presents a promising direction for acceleration,
its direct application in GRPO achieves limited speedup under high-concurrency
training conditions. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
concurrency-aware speculative decoding framework that dynamically adjusts the
drafting and verification strategy according to real-time concurrency levels,
thereby maximizing the acceleration of the generation process. Furthermore, to
address performance degradation arising from distributional drift between the
evolving target model and the fixed draft model during training, we introduce
an online draft learning mechanism that enables the draft model to continuously
adapt using feedback signals from the target model. Experimental results across
multiple mathematical reasoning datasets and models demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves end-to-end speedups of 2.35x to 2.72x, significantly
surpassing baseline approaches in efficiency. The code is available at

Conclusion: 科学基础模型的泛化能力源于训练系统的多样性而非数据量，ChaosNexus为混沌系统预测提供了有效的跨系统泛化解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately forecasting chaotic systems, prevalent in domains such as weather
prediction and fluid dynamics, remains a significant scientific challenge. The
inherent sensitivity of these systems to initial conditions, coupled with a
scarcity of observational data, severely constrains traditional modeling
approaches. Since these models are typically trained for a specific system,
they lack the generalization capacity necessary for real-world applications,
which demand robust zero-shot or few-shot forecasting on novel or data-limited
scenarios. To overcome this generalization barrier, we propose ChaosNexus, a
foundation model pre-trained on a diverse corpus of chaotic dynamics.
ChaosNexus employs a novel multi-scale architecture named ScaleFormer augmented
with Mixture-of-Experts layers, to capture both universal patterns and
system-specific behaviors. The model demonstrates state-of-the-art zero-shot
generalization across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. On a
large-scale testbed comprising over 9,000 synthetic chaotic systems, it
improves the fidelity of long-term attractor statistics by more than 40%
compared to the leading baseline. This robust performance extends to real-world
applications with exceptional data efficiency. For instance, in 5-day global
weather forecasting, ChaosNexus achieves a competitive zero-shot mean error
below 1 degree, a result that further improves with few-shot fine-tuning.
Moreover, experiments on the scaling behavior of ChaosNexus provide a guiding
principle for scientific foundation models: cross-system generalization stems
from the diversity of training systems, rather than sheer data volume.

Method: 训练了Transformer和EquiformerV2神经网络来预测材料属性，通过改变训练数据量、模型规模和计算资源来研究缩放规律，并引入了命令行参数来调整训练设置。

Result: 发现了经验性的缩放规律：损失函数L与相关超参数N之间存在幂律关系L = α·N^(-β)，其中α和β是常数。这种关系可以帮助预测增加训练数据、模型规模或计算资源对预测性能的影响。

Conclusion: 研究证实了在材料属性预测领域存在缩放规律，未来工作可以进一步研究其他神经网络模型（如GemNet和全连接网络）的缩放规律，并与当前训练的模型进行比较。

Abstract: Predicting material properties is crucial for designing better batteries,
semiconductors, and medical devices. Deep learning helps scientists quickly
find promising materials by predicting their energy, forces, and stresses.
Companies scale capacities of deep learning models in multiple domains, such as
language modeling, and invest many millions of dollars into such models. Our
team analyzes how scaling training data (giving models more information to
learn from), model sizes (giving models more capacity to learn patterns), and
compute (giving models more computational resources) for neural networks
affects their performance for material property prediction. In particular, we
trained both transformer and EquiformerV2 neural networks to predict material
properties. We find empirical scaling laws for these models: we can predict how
increasing each of the three hyperparameters (training data, model size, and
compute) affects predictive performance. In particular, the loss $L$ can be
measured with a power law relationship $L = \alpha \cdot N^{-\beta}$, where
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ are constants while $N$ is the relevant hyperparameter. We
also incorporate command-line arguments for changing training settings such as
the amount of epochs, maximum learning rate, and whether mixed precision is
enabled. Future work could entail further investigating scaling laws for other
neural network models in this domain, such as GemNet and fully connected
networks, to assess how they compare to the models we trained.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然SAM方法通常能引导训练到更平坦的极小值点以提升泛化能力，但作者发现该方法可能收敛到虚假的极小值点。

Method: 通过理论证明虚假极小值点的存在性，建立局部收敛条件，并提供实证证据，最后提出简单有效的避免方法。

Result: 理论和实验均证实SAM确实可能收敛到虚假极小值点，这些点不是原始目标的真实极小值。

Conclusion: SAM方法存在收敛到虚假极小值点的风险，需要采取适当措施来避免这种情况。

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) is a widely used method that steers
training toward flatter minimizers, which typically generalize better. In this
work, however, we show that SAM can converge to hallucinated minimizers --
points that are not minimizers of the original objective. We theoretically
prove the existence of such hallucinated minimizers and establish conditions
for local convergence to them. We further provide empirical evidence
demonstrating that SAM can indeed converge to these points in practice.
Finally, we propose a simple yet effective remedy for avoiding hallucinated
minimizers.

TL;DR: 本文对掩码离散扩散进行了理论分析，提出了MATU方法，在保持无偏离散分数逼近的同时消除了有界分数假设，获得了近乎ε无关的复杂度，显著优于均匀离散扩散。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 掩码离散扩散在文本生成中表现出强大的经验性能，但其在高维设置下的理论复杂性尚未得到充分理解。现有分析主要关注均匀离散扩散，对掩码扩散的分析存在忽视常用Euler采样器、施加限制性有界分数假设或未能展示掩码扩散优势等问题。

Method: 首先证明Euler采样器可在总变差距离上达到ε精度，提供了典型Euler采样器在掩码离散扩散中的首个严格分析。然后提出掩码感知截断均匀化(MATU)方法，该方法利用每个token最多只能被解掩码一次的特性。

Result: MATU方法获得了O(d ln d · (1-ε²))的近乎ε无关复杂度，超越了现有均匀离散扩散下的均匀化方法，消除了ln(1/ε)因子并显著加速收敛。

Conclusion: 研究结果为掩码离散扩散提供了严格的理论基础，展示了其在文本生成中相对于均匀扩散的实际优势，并为分析基于掩码范式的扩散语言模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: We study masked discrete diffusion -- a flexible paradigm for text generation
in which tokens are progressively corrupted by special mask symbols before
being denoised. Although this approach has demonstrated strong empirical
performance, its theoretical complexity in high-dimensional settings remains
insufficiently understood. Existing analyses largely focus on uniform discrete
diffusion, and more recent attempts addressing masked diffusion either (1)
overlook widely used Euler samplers, (2) impose restrictive bounded-score
assumptions, or (3) fail to showcase the advantages of masked discrete
diffusion over its uniform counterpart. To address this gap, we show that Euler
samplers can achieve $\epsilon$-accuracy in total variation (TV) with
$\tilde{O}(d^{2}\epsilon^{-3/2})$ discrete score evaluations, thereby providing
the first rigorous analysis of typical Euler sampler in masked discrete
diffusion. We then propose a Mask-Aware Truncated Uniformization (MATU)
approach that both removes bounded-score assumptions and preserves unbiased
discrete score approximation. By exploiting the property that each token can be
unmasked at most once, MATU attains a nearly $\epsilon$-free complexity of
$O(d\,\ln d\cdot (1-\epsilon^2))$. This result surpasses existing
uniformization methods under uniform discrete diffusion, eliminating the
$\ln(1/\epsilon)$ factor and substantially speeding up convergence. Our
findings not only provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for masked discrete
diffusion, showcasing its practical advantages over uniform diffusion for text
generation, but also pave the way for future efforts to analyze diffusion-based
language models developed under masking paradigm.

Abstract: Uniform bounds on sketched inner products of vectors or matrices underpin
several important computational and statistical results in machine learning and
randomized algorithms, including the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (J-L) lemma, the
Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), randomized sketching, and approximate
linear algebra. However, many modern analyses involve *sketched bilinear
forms*, for which existing uniform bounds either do not apply or are not sharp
on general sets. In this work, we develop a general framework to analyze such
sketched bilinear forms and derive uniform bounds in terms of geometric
complexities of the associated sets. Our approach relies on generic chaining
and introduces new techniques for handling suprema over pairs of sets. We
further extend these results to the setting where the bilinear form involves a
sum of $T$ independent sketching matrices and show that the deviation scales as
$\sqrt{T}$. This unified analysis recovers known results such as the J-L lemma
as special cases, while extending RIP-type guarantees. Additionally, we obtain
improved convergence bounds for sketched Federated Learning algorithms where
such cross terms arise naturally due to sketched gradient compression, and
design sketched variants of bandit algorithms with sharper regret bounds that
depend on the geometric complexity of the action and parameter sets, rather
than the ambient dimension.

TL;DR: 提出Graph of Agents (GoA)框架，将长上下文建模问题形式化为压缩问题，通过动态构建输入依赖的协作结构来最大化信息论压缩目标，显著提升多智能体系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多智能体系统虽然能够处理超出LLM上下文窗口的长输入，但其性能严重依赖手工设计的协作策略和提示工程，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 基于信息论压缩目标，提出Graph of Agents (GoA)框架，动态构建输入依赖的协作结构，无需重新训练或架构修改。

Result: 在六个文档问答基准测试中，GoA将检索增强生成的平均F1分数提升了5.7%，比使用固定协作结构的多智能体基线提升了16.35%。即使只有2K上下文窗口，GoA在LongBench上仍超越了128K上下文窗口的Llama 3.1 8B。

Conclusion: GoA框架通过信息论方法显著提升了多智能体系统在长上下文建模中的性能，实现了有效的上下文长度扩展。

Abstract: As a model-agnostic approach to long context modeling, multi-agent systems
can process inputs longer than a large language model's context window without
retraining or architectural modifications. However, their performance often
heavily relies on hand-crafted multi-agent collaboration strategies and prompt
engineering, which limit generalizability. In this work, we introduce a
principled framework that formalizes the model-agnostic long context modeling
problem as a compression problem, yielding an information-theoretic compression
objective. Building on this framework, we propose Graph of Agents (GoA), which
dynamically constructs an input-dependent collaboration structure that
maximizes this objective. For Llama 3.1 8B and Qwen3 8B across six document
question answering benchmarks, GoA improves the average $F_1$ score of
retrieval-augmented generation by 5.7\% and a strong multi-agent baseline using
a fixed collaboration structure by 16.35\%, respectively. Even with only a 2K
context window, GoA surpasses the 128K context window Llama 3.1 8B on
LongBench, showing a dramatic increase in effective context length. Our source

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分子基础模型主要依赖SMILES表示，忽略了实验光谱和3D结构信息，这在需要立体化学、空间构象和实验验证的任务中效果有限。

Method: 基于Qwen2.5-7B预训练，明确建模分子光谱，统一实验光谱与分子3D结构。

Result: 在光谱相关任务上达到最先进性能，NMR、IR和MS基准测试平均准确率0.53；光谱到SMILES任务序列准确率15.5%，token准确率41.7%；能够从SMILES或光谱输入直接生成准确的3D分子结构。

Conclusion: MolSpectLLM不仅能在分子解析任务上表现优异，还能连接光谱分析、分子解析和分子设计，为分子基础模型提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in molecular foundation models have shown impressive
performance in molecular property prediction and de novo molecular design, with
promising applications in areas such as drug discovery and reaction prediction.
Nevertheless, most existing approaches rely exclusively on SMILES
representations and overlook both experimental spectra and 3D structural
information-two indispensable sources for capturing molecular behavior in
real-world scenarios. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in tasks
where stereochemistry, spatial conformation, and experimental validation are
critical. To overcome these challenges, we propose MolSpectLLM, a molecular
foundation model pretrained on Qwen2.5-7B that unifies experimental
spectroscopy with molecular 3D structure. By explicitly modeling molecular
spectra, MolSpectLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on spectrum-related
tasks, with an average accuracy of 0.53 across NMR, IR, and MS benchmarks.
MolSpectLLM also shows strong performance on the spectra analysis task,
obtaining 15.5% sequence accuracy and 41.7% token accuracy on
Spectra-to-SMILES, substantially outperforming large general-purpose LLMs. More
importantly, MolSpectLLM not only achieves strong performance on molecular
elucidation tasks, but also generates accurate 3D molecular structures directly
from SMILES or spectral inputs, bridging spectral analysis, molecular
elucidation, and molecular design.

Result: 在多种LLM架构和六个知识密集型基准测试上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 强调了在信息覆盖和干扰之间平衡权衡的重要性，LDAR在减少token使用的同时实现了显著更高的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a framework for grounding Large
Language Models (LLMs) in external, up-to-date information. However, recent
advancements in context window size allow LLMs to process inputs of up to 128K
tokens or more, offering an alternative strategy: supplying the full document
context directly to the model, rather than relying on RAG to retrieve a subset
of contexts. Nevertheless, this emerging alternative strategy has notable
limitations: (i) it is token-inefficient to handle large and potentially
redundant contexts; (ii) it exacerbates the `lost in the middle' phenomenon;
and (iii) under limited model capacity, it amplifies distraction, ultimately
degrading LLM output quality. In this paper, we propose LDAR (Learning
Distraction-Aware Retrieval), an adaptive retriever that learns to retrieve
contexts in a way that mitigates interference from distracting passages,
thereby achieving significantly higher performance with reduced token usage
compared to long-context approaches. Extensive experiments across diverse LLM
architectures and six knowledge-intensive benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of our approach, highlighting the importance of
balancing the trade-off between information coverage and distraction.

Motivation: 解决单独使用ILP需要指定背景知识且计算成本高，或单独使用MLLMs存在感知幻觉的问题，利用MLLMs提出结构正确规则的能力来改进逻辑规则归纳。

Method: 基于MLLMs提出的规则结构自动构建ILP任务并缩减搜索空间，然后使用ILP系统基于修正的逻辑事实和形式归纳推理输出规则。

Result: 在具有挑战性的逻辑归纳基准测试中验证了有效性，并展示了在文本到图像定制生成中的应用潜力。

Conclusion: ILP-CoT成功结合了ILP和MLLMs的优势，通过MLLMs的规则结构提议来指导ILP的搜索过程，实现了更高效和准确的逻辑规则归纳。

Abstract: We propose ILP-CoT, a method that bridges Inductive Logic Programming (ILP)
and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for abductive logical rule
induction. The task involves both discovering logical facts and inducing
logical rules from a small number of unstructured textual or visual inputs,
which still remain challenging when solely relying on ILP, due to the
requirement of specified background knowledge and high computational cost, or
MLLMs, due to the appearance of perceptual hallucinations. Based on the key
observation that MLLMs could propose structure-correct rules even under
hallucinations, our approach automatically builds ILP tasks with pruned search
spaces based on the rule structure proposals from MLLMs, and utilizes ILP
system to output rules built upon rectified logical facts and formal inductive
reasoning. Its effectiveness is verified through challenging logical induction
benchmarks, as well as a potential application of our approach, namely
text-to-image customized generation with rule induction. Our code and data are

Motivation: 尽管神经常微分方程因其动力学系统特性对输入扰动具有内在鲁棒性，但现有方法在施加Lyapunov稳定性条件时面临鲁棒性与准确性之间的张力问题。

Method: 提出Zubov-Net框架，将Zubov方程重新表述为吸引区域与预设吸引区域之间的一致性表征，通过三方损失（一致性、分类和分离损失）和并行边界采样算法共同优化神经ODE和Lyapunov函数，并设计了基于输入注意力的凸神经网络。

Result: 实验表明，Zubov-Net在保持高分类精度的同时，显著提高了对各种随机噪声和对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过最小化三方损失可以保证预设吸引区域与真实吸引区域的一致性对齐、轨迹稳定性和非重叠预设吸引区域，理论证明了随机凸可分性具有更紧的概率界限和更少的维度要求。

Abstract: Despite neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) exhibiting
intrinsic robustness under input perturbations due to their dynamical systems
nature, recent approaches often involve imposing Lyapunov-based stability
conditions to provide formal robustness guarantees. However, a fundamental
challenge remains: the tension between robustness and accuracy, primarily
stemming from the difficulty in imposing appropriate stability conditions. To
address this, we propose an adaptive stable learning framework named Zubov-Net,
which innovatively reformulates Zubov's equation into a consistency
characterization between regions of attraction (RoAs) and prescribed RoAs
(PRoAs). Building on this consistency, we introduce a new paradigm for actively
controlling the geometry of RoAs by directly optimizing PRoAs to reconcile
accuracy and robustness. Our approach is realized through tripartite losses
(consistency, classification, and separation losses) and a parallel boundary
sampling algorithm that co-optimizes the Neural ODE and the Lyapunov function.
To enhance the discriminativity of Lyapunov functions, we design an
input-attention-based convex neural network via a softmax attention mechanism
that focuses on equilibrium-relevant features and also serves as weight
normalization to maintain training stability in deep architectures.
Theoretically, we prove that minimizing the tripartite loss guarantees
consistent alignment of PRoAs-RoAs, trajectory stability, and non-overlapping
PRoAs. Moreover, we establish stochastic convex separability with tighter
probability bounds and fewer dimensionality requirements to justify the convex
design in Lyapunov functions. Experimentally, Zubov-Net maintains high
classification accuracy while significantly improving robustness against
various stochastic noises and adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: RLVR具有价值且适合工业应用，但需要优先考虑可靠性、安全性和测量标准，同时保留其实际效益。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a practical and
scalable approach to enhancing large language models in areas such as math,
code, and other structured tasks. Two questions motivate this paper: how much
of the reported gains survive under strictly parity-controlled evaluation, and
whether RLVR is cost-free or exacts a measurable tax. We argue that progress is
real, but gains are often overstated due to three forces - an RLVR tax,
evaluation pitfalls, and data contamination. Using a partial-prompt
contamination audit and matched-budget reproductions across base and RL models,
we show that several headline gaps shrink or vanish under clean,
parity-controlled evaluation. We then propose a tax-aware training and
evaluation protocol that co-optimizes accuracy, grounding, and calibrated
abstention and standardizes budgeting and provenance checks. Applied to recent
RLVR setups, this protocol yields more reliable estimates of reasoning gains
and, in several cases, revises prior conclusions. Our position is constructive:
RLVR is valuable and industry-ready; we advocate keeping its practical benefits
while prioritizing reliability, safety, and measurement.

Abstract: We derive a new Rademacher complexity bound for deep neural networks using
Koopman operators, group representations, and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces
(RKHSs). The proposed bound describes why the models with high-rank weight
matrices generalize well. Although there are existing bounds that attempt to
describe this phenomenon, these existing bounds can be applied to limited types
of models. We introduce an algebraic representation of neural networks and a
kernel function to construct an RKHS to derive a bound for a wider range of
realistic models. This work paves the way for the Koopman-based theory for
Rademacher complexity bounds to be valid for more practical situations.

Method: 提出增量向量变换(IVT)框架，周期性将模型参数传送到保持与先前任务最优解线性连接的变换解，使用对角Fisher信息矩阵高效近似变换

Result: 在CIFAR-100上提升PASS基线最后准确率+5.12%，在FGVCAircraft上提升CLIP预训练SLCA基线平均准确率+14.93%和最后准确率+21.95%

Conclusion: IVT能有效缓解灾难性遗忘，兼容多种初始化策略，在无样本和有样本场景下均表现优异

Abstract: Class Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to sequentially acquire knowledge of
new classes without forgetting previously learned ones. Despite recent
progress, current CIL methods still exhibit significant performance gaps
compared to their oracle counterparts-models trained with full access to
historical data. Inspired by recent insights on Linear Mode Connectivity (LMC),
we revisit the geometric properties of oracle solutions in CIL and uncover a
fundamental observation: these oracle solutions typically maintain low-loss
linear connections to the optimum of previous tasks. Motivated by this finding,
we propose Increment Vector Transformation (IVT), a novel plug-and-play
framework designed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting during training. Rather
than directly following CIL updates, IVT periodically teleports the model
parameters to transformed solutions that preserve linear connectivity to
previous task optimum. By maintaining low-loss along these connecting paths,
IVT effectively ensures stable performance on previously learned tasks. The
transformation is efficiently approximated using diagonal Fisher Information
Matrices, making IVT suitable for both exemplar-free and exemplar-based
scenarios, and compatible with various initialization strategies. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-100, FGVCAircraft, ImageNet-Subset, and ImageNet-Full
demonstrate that IVT consistently enhances the performance of strong CIL
baselines. Specifically, on CIFAR-100, IVT improves the last accuracy of the
PASS baseline by +5.12% and reduces forgetting by 2.54%. For the
CLIP-pre-trained SLCA baseline on FGVCAircraft, IVT yields gains of +14.93% in
average accuracy and +21.95% in last accuracy. The code will be released.

Motivation: 现有离散数据引导方法主要基于一阶泰勒近似，但在离散状态空间中近似误差可能很大，需要更精确的引导框架。

Method: 推导目标分布的确切转移率，结合离散流匹配模型，实现每个采样步骤仅需单次前向传播的高效引导。

Conclusion: 提出了一个统一的离散引导框架，涵盖现有方法作为特例，并能无缝应用于掩码扩散模型，显著提升采样效率。

Abstract: Guidance provides a simple and effective framework for posterior sampling by
steering the generation process towards the desired distribution. When modeling
discrete data, existing approaches mostly focus on guidance with the
first-order Taylor approximation to improve the sampling efficiency. However,
such an approximation is inappropriate in discrete state spaces since the
approximation error could be large. A novel guidance framework for discrete
data is proposed to address this problem: We derive the exact transition rate
for the desired distribution given a learned discrete flow matching model,
leading to guidance that only requires a single forward pass in each sampling
step, significantly improving efficiency. This unified novel framework is
general enough, encompassing existing guidance methods as special cases, and it
can also be seamlessly applied to the masked diffusion model. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed guidance on energy-guided simulations and
preference alignment on text-to-image generation and multimodal understanding
tasks. The code is available through

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险领域如医疗保健中，机器学习模型的可解释性至关重要。GAMs虽然可解释但忽略了高阶交互效应，而CESR包含全特征交互但性能不佳，需要一种既能保持可解释性又能提升性能的模型。

Method: MACMs在CESR基础上增加加性部分，分离交互项和独立项的系数，扩展假设空间。模型包含乘性部分和加性部分，两者的形状函数都能自然可视化。

Result: 实验结果表明，基于神经网络的MACMs在预测性能上显著优于CESR和当前最先进的GAMs。

Conclusion: MACMs通过结合乘性和加性组件，在保持可解释性的同时显著提升了预测性能，为高风险领域的机器学习应用提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Interpretability is one of the considerations when applying machine learning
to high-stakes fields such as healthcare that involve matters of life safety.
Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) enhance interpretability by visualizing
shape functions. Nevertheless, to preserve interpretability, GAMs omit
higher-order interaction effects (beyond pairwise interactions), which imposes
significant constraints on their predictive performance. We observe that Curve
Ergodic Set Regression (CESR), a multiplicative model, naturally enables the
visualization of its shape functions and simultaneously incorporates both
interactions among all features and individual feature effects. Nevertheless,
CESR fails to demonstrate superior performance compared to GAMs. We introduce
Multiplicative-Additive Constrained Models (MACMs), which augment CESR with an
additive part to disentangle the intertwined coefficients of its interactive
and independent terms, thus effectively broadening the hypothesis space. The
model is composed of a multiplicative part and an additive part, whose shape
functions can both be naturally visualized, thereby assisting users in
interpreting how features participate in the decision-making process.
Consequently, MACMs constitute an improvement over both CESR and GAMs. The
experimental results indicate that neural network-based MACMs significantly
outperform both CESR and the current state-of-the-art GAMs in terms of
predictive performance.

Conclusion: 实验验证了理论分析，表明随机生成过程在生成任务和分类等下游任务中表现出理论预测的行为模式。

Abstract: This paper investigates the theoretical behavior of generative models under
finite training populations. Within the stochastic interpolation generative
framework, we derive closed-form expressions for the optimal velocity field and
score function when only a finite number of training samples are available. We
demonstrate that, under some regularity conditions, the deterministic
generative process exactly recovers the training samples, while the stochastic
generative process manifests as training samples with added Gaussian noise.
Beyond the idealized setting, we consider model estimation errors and introduce
formal definitions of underfitting and overfitting specific to generative
models. Our theoretical analysis reveals that, in the presence of estimation
errors, the stochastic generation process effectively produces convex
combinations of training samples corrupted by a mixture of uniform and Gaussian
noise. Experiments on generation tasks and downstream tasks such as
classification support our theory.

Abstract: The analysis of complex building time-series for actionable insights and
recommendations remains challenging due to the nonlinear and multi-scale
characteristics of energy data. To address this, we propose a framework that
fine-tunes visual language large models (VLLMs) on 3D graphical representations
of the data. The approach converts 1D time-series into 3D representations using
continuous wavelet transforms (CWTs) and recurrence plots (RPs), which capture
temporal dynamics and localize frequency anomalies. These 3D encodings enable
VLLMs to visually interpret energy-consumption patterns, detect anomalies, and
provide recommendations for energy efficiency. We demonstrate the framework on
real-world building-energy datasets, where fine-tuned VLLMs successfully
monitor building states, identify recurring anomalies, and generate
optimization recommendations. Quantitatively, the Idefics-7B VLLM achieves
validation losses of 0.0952 with CWTs and 0.1064 with RPs on the University of
Sharjah energy dataset, outperforming direct fine-tuning on raw time-series
data (0.1176) for anomaly detection. This work bridges time-series analysis and
visualization, providing a scalable and interpretable framework for energy
analytics.

Conclusion: softmax在注意力机制中具有理论优势，其性能优于线性注意力和其他替代方案。

Abstract: Large language models rely on attention mechanisms with a softmax activation.
Yet the dominance of softmax over alternatives (e.g., component-wise or linear)
remains poorly understood, and many theoretical works have focused on the
easier-to-analyze linearized attention. In this work, we address this gap
through a principled study of the single-location regression task, where the
output depends on a linear transformation of a single input token at a random
location. Building on ideas from statistical physics, we develop an analysis of
attention-based predictors in the high-dimensional limit, where generalization
performance is captured by a small set of order parameters. At the population
level, we show that softmax achieves the Bayes risk, whereas linear attention
fundamentally falls short. We then examine other activation functions to
identify which properties are necessary for optimal performance. Finally, we
analyze the finite-sample regime: we provide an asymptotic characterization of
the test error and show that, while softmax is no longer Bayes-optimal, it
consistently outperforms linear attention. We discuss the connection with
optimization by gradient-based algorithms.

*Xianghua Zeng,Hao Peng,Angsheng Li,Yicheng Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SIHD是一个基于结构信息的分层扩散框架，用于解决离线强化学习中长时程规划问题，通过自适应构建扩散层次和多时间尺度建模来提升决策性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分层扩散方法通常采用固定的两层扩散层次和单一预定义时间尺度，限制了在不同下游任务中的适应性和决策灵活性。

Method: 分析离线轨迹中的结构信息来自适应构建扩散层次，使用状态社区的结构信息增益作为扩散层的条件信号，并引入结构熵正则化器减少对离线数据集的过度依赖。

Result: 在具有挑战性的离线RL任务上的广泛评估表明，SIHD在决策性能上显著优于最先进的基线方法，并在多样化场景中展现出优越的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SIHD框架通过自适应层次构建和结构信息利用，有效解决了长时程环境中稀疏奖励的离线策略学习问题，提供了更稳定和有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative methods have shown promising potential for
modeling trajectories from offline reinforcement learning (RL) datasets, and
hierarchical diffusion has been introduced to mitigate variance accumulation
and computational challenges in long-horizon planning tasks. However, existing
approaches typically assume a fixed two-layer diffusion hierarchy with a single
predefined temporal scale, which limits adaptability to diverse downstream
tasks and reduces flexibility in decision making. In this work, we propose
SIHD, a novel Structural Information-based Hierarchical Diffusion framework for
effective and stable offline policy learning in long-horizon environments with
sparse rewards. Specifically, we analyze structural information embedded in
offline trajectories to construct the diffusion hierarchy adaptively, enabling
flexible trajectory modeling across multiple temporal scales. Rather than
relying on reward predictions from localized sub-trajectories, we quantify the
structural information gain of each state community and use it as a
conditioning signal within the corresponding diffusion layer. To reduce
overreliance on offline datasets, we introduce a structural entropy regularizer
that encourages exploration of underrepresented states while avoiding
extrapolation errors from distributional shifts. Extensive evaluations on
challenging offline RL tasks show that SIHD significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in decision-making performance and demonstrates
superior generalization across diverse scenarios.

*Taeyoung Yun,Pierre-Luc St-Charles,Jinkyoo Park,Yoshua Bengio,Minsu Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Active Attacks算法，通过主动学习范式让攻击者LLM适应不断进化的受害者模型，自动生成多样化的有害提示，显著提升了攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的攻击方法在发现高奖励提示后容易陷入局部最优，难以覆盖广泛的有害行为模式，需要显式的多样性目标来提升攻击覆盖范围。

Method: 结合主动学习思想，定期用收集的攻击提示对受害者模型进行安全微调，使已开发区域的奖励降低，迫使攻击者探索新的脆弱性区域，形成从易到难的探索课程。

Result: Active Attacks将对抗GFlowNets的跨攻击成功率从0.07%提升至31.28%（相对增益超过400倍），计算成本仅增加6%。

Conclusion: Active Attacks作为一种即插即用模块，能够有效解决多模态攻击分布覆盖问题，在多样化攻击生成方面显著优于现有RL方法。

Abstract: We address the challenge of generating diverse attack prompts for large
language models (LLMs) that elicit harmful behaviors (e.g., insults, sexual
content) and are used for safety fine-tuning. Rather than relying on manual
prompt engineering, attacker LLMs can be trained with reinforcement learning
(RL) to automatically generate such prompts using only a toxicity classifier as
a reward. However, capturing a wide range of harmful behaviors is a significant
challenge that requires explicit diversity objectives. Existing
diversity-seeking RL methods often collapse to limited modes: once high-reward
prompts are found, exploration of new regions is discouraged. Inspired by the
active learning paradigm that encourages adaptive exploration, we introduce
\textit{Active Attacks}, a novel RL-based red-teaming algorithm that adapts its
attacks as the victim evolves. By periodically safety fine-tuning the victim
LLM with collected attack prompts, rewards in exploited regions diminish, which
forces the attacker to seek unexplored vulnerabilities. This process naturally
induces an easy-to-hard exploration curriculum, where the attacker progresses
beyond easy modes toward increasingly difficult ones. As a result, Active
Attacks uncovers a wide range of local attack modes step by step, and their
combination achieves wide coverage of the multi-mode distribution. Active
Attacks, a simple plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates into existing
RL objectives, unexpectedly outperformed prior RL-based methods -- including
GFlowNets, PPO, and REINFORCE -- by improving cross-attack success rates
against GFlowNets, the previous state-of-the-art, from 0.07% to 31.28% (a
relative gain greater than $400\ \times$) with only a 6% increase in
computation. Our code is publicly available

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种难度自适应推理方法，让大型音频语言模型能够根据问题复杂度动态调整推理深度，避免简单问题过度推理和复杂问题推理不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏细粒度机制来调节推理深度，导致简单问题过度推理而复杂问题推理不足的'一刀切'问题。

Method: 提出奖励函数，将推理长度与模型感知的问题难度动态关联，鼓励简单任务使用简洁推理，复杂任务使用深入推理。

Result: 实验表明该方法既有效又高效，同时提升任务性能并显著减少平均推理长度。

Conclusion: 难度自适应推理方法为大型音频语言模型提供了智能推理机制，为未来工作提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs), powered by the chain-of-thought (CoT)
paradigm, have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities. Intuitively, different
problems often require varying depths of reasoning. While some methods can
determine whether to reason for a given problem, they typically lack a
fine-grained mechanism to modulate how much to reason. This often results in a
``one-size-fits-all'' reasoning depth, which generates redundant overthinking
for simple questions while failing to allocate sufficient thought to complex
ones. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of LALMs and find that an
effective and efficient LALM should reason smartly by adapting its reasoning
depth to the problem's complexity. To achieve this, we propose a
difficulty-adaptive reasoning method for LALMs. Specifically, we propose a
reward function that dynamically links reasoning length to the model's
perceived problem difficulty. This reward encourages shorter, concise reasoning
for easy tasks and more elaborate, in-depth reasoning for complex ones.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method is both effective and
efficient, simultaneously improving task performance and significantly reducing
the average reasoning length. Further analysis on reasoning structure paradigm
offers valuable insights for future work.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRAMDTI是一个多模态预训练框架，通过整合小分子和蛋白质的多模态信息来改进药物靶点相互作用预测，采用四模态对比学习和自适应模态丢弃技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DTI预测方法主要依赖SMILES蛋白质对，未能充分利用小分子和蛋白质的丰富多模态信息，限制了预测性能。

Method: 提出GRAMDTI框架，整合多模态分子和蛋白质输入为统一表示；扩展基于体积的对比学习到四模态；提出自适应模态丢弃技术；结合IC50活性测量作为弱监督。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上的实验表明，GRAMDTI始终优于现有最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: 高阶多模态对齐、自适应模态利用和辅助监督有助于实现稳健且可泛化的DTI预测。

Abstract: Drug target interaction (DTI) prediction is a cornerstone of computational
drug discovery, enabling rational design, repurposing, and mechanistic
insights. While deep learning has advanced DTI modeling, existing approaches
primarily rely on SMILES protein pairs and fail to exploit the rich multimodal
information available for small molecules and proteins. We introduce GRAMDTI, a
pretraining framework that integrates multimodal molecular and protein inputs
into unified representations. GRAMDTI extends volume based contrastive learning
to four modalities, capturing higher-order semantic alignment beyond
conventional pairwise approaches. To handle modality informativeness, we
propose adaptive modality dropout, dynamically regulating each modality's
contribution during pre-training. Additionally, IC50 activity measurements,
when available, are incorporated as weak supervision to ground representations
in biologically meaningful interaction strengths. Experiments on four publicly
available datasets demonstrate that GRAMDTI consistently outperforms state of
the art baselines. Our results highlight the benefits of higher order
multimodal alignment, adaptive modality utilization, and auxiliary supervision
for robust and generalizable DTI prediction.

### [288] [Stage-wise Dynamics of Classifier-Free Guidance in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22007)
*Cheng Jin,Qitan Shi,Yuantao Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文分析了分类器自由引导(CFG)在扩散模型中对采样动态的影响，揭示了CFG在采样过程中分为三个阶段：方向偏移、模式分离和集中阶段，解释了为什么强引导会提高语义对齐但减少多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CFG被广泛用于提高扩散模型的条件保真度，但其对采样动态的影响仍不清楚。先前研究通常局限于单峰条件分布或简化情况，只能提供部分理解。

Method: 分析了CFG在多峰条件分布下的行为，将采样过程分解为三个连续阶段，并通过实验验证这些预测。

Result: 实验支持理论预测：早期强引导侵蚀全局多样性，而后期强引导抑制细粒度变化。提出的时变引导调度在质量和多样性方面都取得了改进。

Conclusion: CFG的采样过程分为三个阶段，强引导在提高语义对齐的同时不可避免地减少多样性。时变引导调度可以同时改善质量和多样性。

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is widely used to improve conditional fidelity
in diffusion models, but its impact on sampling dynamics remains poorly
understood. Prior studies, often restricted to unimodal conditional
distributions or simplified cases, provide only a partial picture. We analyze
CFG under multimodal conditionals and show that the sampling process unfolds in
three successive stages. In the Direction Shift stage, guidance accelerates
movement toward the weighted mean, introducing initialization bias and norm
growth. In the Mode Separation stage, local dynamics remain largely neutral,
but the inherited bias suppresses weaker modes, reducing global diversity. In
the Concentration stage, guidance amplifies within-mode contraction,
diminishing fine-grained variability. This unified view explains a widely
observed phenomenon: stronger guidance improves semantic alignment but
inevitably reduces diversity. Experiments support these predictions, showing
that early strong guidance erodes global diversity, while late strong guidance
suppresses fine-grained variation. Moreover, our theory naturally suggests a
time-varying guidance schedule, and empirical results confirm that it
consistently improves both quality and diversity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结构化目标引导强化学习方法，通过LLM生成可重用的结构化目标规划函数和动作剪枝机制，提升RL智能体在复杂环境中的探索效率和长期规划能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实决策任务环境复杂开放，传统RL方法在探索效率和长期规划方面存在挑战。现有LLM增强RL方法依赖频繁调用LLM且存在语义不匹配问题。

Method: SGRL方法包含结构化目标规划器和目标条件动作剪枝器。前者利用LLM生成带优先级权重的可重用目标生成函数，后者通过动作掩码机制过滤与当前目标不一致的动作。

Result: 在Crafter和Craftax-Classic环境上的实验结果表明，SGRL相比现有最先进方法取得了更优越的性能。

Conclusion: SGRL方法通过结构化目标规划和动作剪枝机制，有效解决了LLM增强RL中的语义不匹配问题，显著提升了RL智能体的探索效率和决策能力。

Abstract: Real-world decision-making tasks typically occur in complex and open
environments, posing significant challenges to reinforcement learning (RL)
agents' exploration efficiency and long-horizon planning capabilities. A
promising approach is LLM-enhanced RL, which leverages the rich prior knowledge
and strong planning capabilities of LLMs to guide RL agents in efficient
exploration. However, existing methods mostly rely on frequent and costly LLM
invocations and suffer from limited performance due to the semantic mismatch.
In this paper, we introduce a Structured Goal-guided Reinforcement Learning
(SGRL) method that integrates a structured goal planner and a goal-conditioned
action pruner to guide RL agents toward efficient exploration. Specifically,
the structured goal planner utilizes LLMs to generate a reusable, structured
function for goal generation, in which goals are prioritized. Furthermore, by
utilizing LLMs to determine goals' priority weights, it dynamically generates
forward-looking goals to guide the agent's policy toward more promising
decision-making trajectories. The goal-conditioned action pruner employs an
action masking mechanism that filters out actions misaligned with the current
goal, thereby constraining the RL agent to select goal-consistent policies. We
evaluate the proposed method on Crafter and Craftax-Classic, and experimental
results demonstrate that SGRL achieves superior performance compared to
existing state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: Concept-SAE通过混合解缠策略创建语义基础的概念token，相比标准稀疏自编码器能进行因果探测和对抗漏洞定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准稀疏自编码器发现的特征具有模糊性和无基础性，无法可靠地进行模型行为的主动因果探测。

Method: 采用双重监督的混合解缠策略，生成语义基础的概念token。

Result: 该方法产生的token具有高保真度和空间局部性，在解缠方面优于其他方法，支持因果干预和对抗漏洞定位。

Conclusion: Concept-SAE提供了从相关性解释转向机制性因果探测的验证蓝图。

Abstract: Standard Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) excel at discovering a dictionary of a
model's learned features, offering a powerful observational lens. However, the
ambiguous and ungrounded nature of these features makes them unreliable
instruments for the active, causal probing of model behavior. To solve this, we
introduce Concept-SAE, a framework that forges semantically grounded concept
tokens through a novel hybrid disentanglement strategy. We first quantitatively
demonstrate that our dual-supervision approach produces tokens that are
remarkably faithful and spatially localized, outperforming alternative methods
in disentanglement. This validated fidelity enables two critical applications:
(1) we probe the causal link between internal concepts and predictions via
direct intervention, and (2) we probe the model's failure modes by
systematically localizing adversarial vulnerabilities to specific layers.
Concept-SAE provides a validated blueprint for moving beyond correlational
interpretation to the mechanistic, causal probing of model behavior.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AEGIS是一个专为稀疏二分知识图谱设计的边增强框架，通过重采样现有训练边来提升链接预测性能，避免伪造端点，在稀疏图中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决稀疏二分知识图谱中数据不足和边稀疏导致的链接预测困难问题。

Method: 提出AEGIS框架，采用边重采样策略（均匀采样或逆度偏置采样），保持原始节点集不变，避免伪造端点。在自然稀疏图和人工稀疏化基准数据集上进行评估。

Result: 在Amazon和MovieLens上，基于复制的AEGIS变体与基线相当，而语义KNN增强是唯一能恢复AUC和校准的方法；在GDP图上，语义KNN实现了最大的AUC改进和Brier分数降低。

Conclusion: 真实性约束的重采样是稀疏二分链接预测的数据高效策略，当有信息丰富的节点描述时，语义增强能提供额外提升。

Abstract: Bipartite knowledge graphs in niche domains are typically data-poor and
edge-sparse, which hinders link prediction. We introduce AEGIS (Authentic Edge
Growth In Sparsity), an edge-only augmentation framework that resamples
existing training edges -either uniformly simple or with inverse-degree bias
degree-aware -thereby preserving the original node set and sidestepping
fabricated endpoints. To probe authenticity across regimes, we consider
naturally sparse graphs (game design pattern's game-pattern network) and induce
sparsity in denser benchmarks (Amazon, MovieLens) via high-rate bond
percolation. We evaluate augmentations on two complementary metrics: AUC-ROC
(higher is better) and the Brier score (lower is better), using two-tailed
paired t-tests against sparse baselines. On Amazon and MovieLens, copy-based
AEGIS variants match the baseline while the semantic KNN augmentation is the
only method that restores AUC and calibration; random and synthetic edges
remain detrimental. On the text-rich GDP graph, semantic KNN achieves the
largest AUC improvement and Brier score reduction, and simple also lowers the
Brier score relative to the sparse control. These findings position
authenticity-constrained resampling as a data-efficient strategy for sparse
bipartite link prediction, with semantic augmentation providing an additional
boost when informative node descriptions are available.

TL;DR: WeatherPEFT是一个针对天气基础模型的参数高效微调框架，通过任务自适应动态提示和随机Fisher引导自适应选择，在保持预训练知识的同时实现与全参数微调相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前参数高效微调方法无法有效处理天气下游任务的独特挑战，如变量异质性、分辨率多样性和时空覆盖变化，导致在天气基础模型上表现不佳。

Method: WeatherPEFT包含两个创新：1) 前向传播中的任务自适应动态提示，通过内外模式提取动态注入嵌入权重；2) 反向传播中的随机Fisher引导自适应选择，利用Fisher信息识别关键参数并引入随机性稳定选择。

Result: 在三个下游任务上，WeatherPEFT使用更少的可训练参数实现了与全参数微调相当的性能，而现有PEFT方法表现显著落后。

Conclusion: WeatherPEFT有效解决了天气基础模型在参数高效微调中的独特挑战，为实际部署提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: While recent advances in machine learning have equipped Weather Foundation
Models (WFMs) with substantial generalization capabilities across diverse
downstream tasks, the escalating computational requirements associated with
their expanding scale increasingly hinder practical deployment. Current
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, designed for vision or language
tasks, fail to address the unique challenges of weather downstream tasks, such
as variable heterogeneity, resolution diversity, and spatiotemporal coverage
variations, leading to suboptimal performance when applied to WFMs. To bridge
this gap, we introduce WeatherPEFT, a novel PEFT framework for WFMs
incorporating two synergistic innovations. First, during the forward pass,
Task-Adaptive Dynamic Prompting (TADP) dynamically injects the embedding
weights within the encoder to the input tokens of the pre-trained backbone via
internal and external pattern extraction, enabling context-aware feature
recalibration for specific downstream tasks. Furthermore, during
backpropagation, Stochastic Fisher-Guided Adaptive Selection (SFAS) not only
leverages Fisher information to identify and update the most task-critical
parameters, thereby preserving invariant pre-trained knowledge, but also
introduces randomness to stabilize the selection. We demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of WeatherPEFT on three downstream tasks, where
existing PEFT methods show significant gaps versus Full-Tuning, and WeatherPEFT
achieves performance parity with Full-Tuning using fewer trainable parameters.
The code of this work will be released.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在组合问题（如数独、旅行商问题等）上表现不佳，需要填补这一能力空白。

Method: 将数独规则的模仿学习与显式的深度优先搜索策略相结合，包含有根据的猜测和回溯机制。

Result: 在数独问题上实现了99%的准确率，超越了之前的神经符号方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为NP类问题的求解提供了新思路，并建立了与上下文变体Min-Sum Set Cover问题的理论联系。

Abstract: Despite their proficiency in various language tasks, Large Language Models
(LLMs) struggle with combinatorial problems like Satisfiability, Traveling
Salesman Problem, or even basic arithmetic. We address this gap through a novel
approach for solving problems in the class NP. We focus on the paradigmatic
task of Sudoku and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy (99\%) compared to prior
neuro-symbolic approaches. Unlike prior work that used custom architectures,
our method employs a vanilla decoder-only Transformer (GPT-2) without external
tools or function calling. Our method integrates imitation learning of simple
Sudoku rules with an explicit Depth-First Search (DFS) exploration strategy
involving informed guessing and backtracking. Moving beyond imitation learning,
we seek to minimize the number of guesses until reaching a solution. We provide
a rigorous analysis of this setup formalizing its connection to a contextual
variant of Min-Sum Set Cover, a well-studied problem in algorithms and
stochastic optimization.

TL;DR: 提出MCGM模块，通过多阶段聚类全局建模解决几何图神经网络的长程相互作用建模问题，显著提升分子能量预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 几何图神经网络擅长捕捉分子几何结构，但其局部偏置的消息传递机制难以有效建模长程相互作用。现有解决方案存在计算成本高、系统特异性强、参数调优复杂等局限性。

Method: 引入多阶段聚类全局建模(MCGM)模块，通过构建原子簇的多分辨率层次结构，利用动态层次聚类提取全局信息，并通过学习变换传播上下文，最终通过残差连接增强原子特征。

Result: 在OE62数据集上平均减少能量预测误差26.2%；在AQM数据集上达到最先进精度（能量17.0 meV，力4.9 meV/Å），且比Neural P3M少用20%参数。

Conclusion: MCGM是一种轻量级即插即用模块，能够为几何图神经网络提供分层全局上下文，有效解决长程相互作用建模问题，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升性能。

Abstract: Geometric graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at capturing molecular geometry,
yet their locality-biased message passing hampers the modeling of long-range
interactions. Current solutions have fundamental limitations: extending cutoff
radii causes computational costs to scale cubically with distance;
physics-inspired kernels (e.g., Coulomb, dispersion) are often system-specific
and lack generality; Fourier-space methods require careful tuning of multiple
parameters (e.g., mesh size, k-space cutoff) with added computational overhead.
We introduce Multi-stage Clustered Global Modeling (MCGM), a lightweight,
plug-and-play module that endows geometric GNNs with hierarchical global
context through efficient clustering operations. MCGM builds a multi-resolution
hierarchy of atomic clusters, distills global information via dynamic
hierarchical clustering, and propagates this context back through learned
transformations, ultimately reinforcing atomic features via residual
connections. Seamlessly integrated into four diverse backbone architectures,
MCGM reduces OE62 energy prediction error by an average of 26.2%. On AQM, MCGM
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (17.0 meV for energy, 4.9 meV/{\AA} for
forces) while using 20% fewer parameters than Neural P3M. Code will be made
available upon acceptance.

Motivation: 传统稀疏自编码器存在特征吸收（专用特征捕获通用特征实例）和特征组合（独立特征合并为复合表示）的问题，影响特征的可解释性和质量。

Method: 引入新的训练过程，惩罚SAE特征间的高余弦相似度，强制特征正交化，该方法计算复杂度随SAE规模线性增长。

Result: OrtSAE发现更多独特特征（+9%），显著减少特征吸收（-65%）和组合（-15%），在虚假相关性去除任务上性能提升6%，其他下游任务表现与传统SAE相当。

Conclusion: 正交约束是解决稀疏自编码器特征纠缠问题的有效方法，OrtSAE在保持计算效率的同时显著改善了特征解耦质量。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a technique for sparse decomposition of neural
network activations into human-interpretable features. However, current SAEs
suffer from feature absorption, where specialized features capture instances of
general features creating representation holes, and feature composition, where
independent features merge into composite representations. In this work, we
introduce Orthogonal SAE (OrtSAE), a novel approach aimed to mitigate these
issues by enforcing orthogonality between the learned features. By implementing
a new training procedure that penalizes high pairwise cosine similarity between
SAE features, OrtSAE promotes the development of disentangled features while
scaling linearly with the SAE size, avoiding significant computational
overhead. We train OrtSAE across different models and layers and compare it
with other methods. We find that OrtSAE discovers 9% more distinct features,
reduces feature absorption (by 65%) and composition (by 15%), improves
performance on spurious correlation removal (+6%), and achieves on-par
performance for other downstream tasks compared to traditional SAEs.

use in conceptual blending and dynamic motion generation. Our findings reveal
latent space structures with semantic and meaningless regions, offering
insights into the geometry of diffusion models and paving the way for further
explorations of latent space.

Conclusion: CDP能够有效保持局部非凸性，并提供可验证的失真保证，使实践者能够在自己的数据上检查这些保证。

Abstract: We propose Convexity-Driven Projection (CDP), a boundary-free linear method
for dimensionality reduction of point clouds that targets preserving
detour-induced local non-convexity. CDP builds a $k$-NN graph, identifies
admissible pairs whose Euclidean-to-shortest-path ratios are below a threshold,
and aggregates their normalized directions to form a positive semidefinite
non-convexity structure matrix. The projection uses the top-$k$ eigenvectors of
the structure matrix. We give two verifiable guarantees. A pairwise
a-posteriori certificate that bounds the post-projection distortion for each
admissible pair, and an average-case spectral bound that links expected
captured direction energy to the spectrum of the structure matrix, yielding
quantile statements for typical distortion. Our evaluation protocol reports
fixed- and reselected-pairs detour errors and certificate quantiles, enabling
practitioners to check guarantees on their data.

Method: 提出MO-GRPO算法，使用归一化方法自动重新加权奖励函数，根据奖励值的方差调整权重，确保所有奖励函数对损失函数贡献均衡。

Result: 在四个领域（多臂老虎机、模拟控制任务、机器翻译、指令跟随任务）的实验表明，MO-GRPO通过均衡分配奖励组件间的相关性实现稳定学习，性能优于GRPO。

Conclusion: MO-GRPO是多目标强化学习问题的有前景算法，能自动调整奖励函数权重，无需手动调优奖励函数尺度。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has been shown to be an effective
algorithm when an accurate reward model is available. However, such a highly
reliable reward model is not available in many real-world tasks. In this paper,
we particularly focus on multi-objective settings, in which we identify that
GRPO is vulnerable to reward hacking, optimizing only one of the objectives at
the cost of the others. To address this issue, we propose MO-GRPO, an extension
of GRPO with a simple normalization method to reweight the reward functions
automatically according to the variances of their values. We first show
analytically that MO-GRPO ensures that all reward functions contribute evenly
to the loss function while preserving the order of preferences, eliminating the
need for manual tuning of the reward functions' scales. Then, we evaluate
MO-GRPO experimentally in four domains: (i) the multi-armed bandits problem,
(ii) simulated control task (Mo-Gymnasium), (iii) machine translation tasks on
the WMT benchmark (En-Ja, En-Zh), and (iv) instruction following task. MO-GRPO
achieves stable learning by evenly distributing correlations among the
components of rewards, outperforming GRPO, showing MO-GRPO to be a promising
algorithm for multi-objective reinforcement learning problems.

TL;DR: BrainPro是一个大型EEG基础模型，通过检索式空间学习模块和脑状态解耦模块，解决了现有模型在通道交互和状态感知表示学习方面的不足，在多个BCI数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG基础模型未能显式捕捉通道间和区域间的交互信息，且由于数据集通道配置差异，要么用自注意力近似空间结构，要么限制在有限通用通道上训练。此外，当前模型很少在自监督预训练中学习状态感知表示。

Method: 提出BrainPro模型，包含检索式空间学习模块来灵活捕捉不同电极布局下的通道和区域级交互，以及脑状态解耦模块通过并行编码器和解耦损失实现状态感知表示学习。

Result: 在广泛EEG语料库上预训练后，BrainPro在九个公共BCI数据集上实现了最先进的性能和鲁棒泛化能力。

Conclusion: BrainPro通过创新的空间学习和状态解耦设计，能够无缝适应多样化任务和硬件设置，为EEG基础模型提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique for recording brain
electrical activity, widely used in brain-computer interface (BCI) and
healthcare. Recent EEG foundation models trained on large-scale datasets have
shown improved performance and generalizability over traditional decoding
methods, yet significant challenges remain. Existing models often fail to
explicitly capture channel-to-channel and region-to-region interactions, which
are critical sources of information inherently encoded in EEG signals. Due to
varying channel configurations across datasets, they either approximate spatial
structure with self-attention or restrict training to a limited set of common
channels, sacrificing flexibility and effectiveness. Moreover, although EEG
datasets reflect diverse brain states such as emotion, motor, and others,
current models rarely learn state-aware representations during self-supervised
pre-training. To address these gaps, we propose BrainPro, a large EEG model
that introduces a retrieval-based spatial learning block to flexibly capture
channel- and region-level interactions across varying electrode layouts, and a
brain state-decoupling block that enables state-aware representation learning
through parallel encoders with decoupling and region-aware reconstruction
losses. This design allows BrainPro to adapt seamlessly to diverse tasks and
hardware settings. Pre-trained on an extensive EEG corpus, BrainPro achieves
state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization across nine public BCI
datasets. Our codes and the pre-trained weights will be released.

TL;DR: 提出在教师模型训练中引入类内对比损失来丰富软标签中的类内信息，并通过融入边界损失解决训练不稳定和收敛慢的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏方法中，教师模型主要遵循真实标签作为目标，没有考虑同一类别内的多样化表示，导致软标签中的类内信息不足。

Method: 在教师训练中引入类内对比损失来丰富软标签的类内多样性，同时结合边界损失来提高训练稳定性和收敛速度。

Result: 理论分析证明类内对比损失能够丰富类内多样性，实验结果表明所提方法有效。

Conclusion: 通过类内对比损失和边界损失的结合，能够有效提升知识蒸馏中软标签的质量和训练效率。

Abstract: Since the advent of knowledge distillation, much research has focused on how
the soft labels generated by the teacher model can be utilized effectively.
Existing studies points out that the implicit knowledge within soft labels
originates from the multi-view structure present in the data. Feature
variations within samples of the same class allow the student model to
generalize better by learning diverse representations. However, in existing
distillation methods, teacher models predominantly adhere to ground-truth
labels as targets, without considering the diverse representations within the
same class. Therefore, we propose incorporating an intra-class contrastive loss
during teacher training to enrich the intra-class information contained in soft
labels. In practice, we find that intra-class loss causes instability in
training and slows convergence. To mitigate these issues, margin loss is
integrated into intra-class contrastive learning to improve the training
stability and convergence speed. Simultaneously, we theoretically analyze the
impact of this loss on the intra-class distances and inter-class distances. It
has been proved that the intra-class contrastive loss can enrich the
intra-class diversity. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed method.

Conclusion: 该研究填补了部分参数迁移理论理解的空白，为迁移学习实践提供了理论指导，解释了参数迁移效果的边界条件。

Abstract: Parameter transfer is a central paradigm in transfer learning, enabling
knowledge reuse across tasks and domains by sharing model parameters between
upstream and downstream models. However, when only a subset of parameters from
the upstream model is transferred to the downstream model, there remains a lack
of theoretical understanding of the conditions under which such partial
parameter reuse is beneficial and of the factors that govern its effectiveness.
To address this gap, we analyze a setting in which both the upstream and
downstream models are ReLU convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Within this
theoretical framework, we characterize how the inherited parameters act as
carriers of universal knowledge and identify key factors that amplify their
beneficial impact on the target task. Furthermore, our analysis provides
insight into why, in certain cases, transferring parameters can lead to lower
test accuracy on the target task than training a new model from scratch.
Numerical experiments and real-world data experiments are conducted to
empirically validate our theoretical findings.

TL;DR: 激活导向技术通过向LLM隐藏状态添加语义向量来控制模型行为，但研究发现这会系统性破坏模型的安全防护，使其更容易响应有害请求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估激活导向技术作为精确、可解释且安全的微调替代方案的实际安全性。

Method: 在不同模型家族上进行广泛实验，测试随机方向导向、使用稀疏自编码器提取的良性特征导向，以及组合多个导向向量的效果。

Result: 随机导向可将有害合规概率从0%提升到2-27%；使用SAE良性特征导向进一步增加2-4%；组合20个随机向量可创建通用攻击，显著提高对未见请求的有害合规率。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了"通过可解释性实现安全"的范式，表明对模型内部的精确控制并不能保证对模型行为的精确控制。

Abstract: Activation steering is a promising technique for controlling LLM behavior by
adding semantically meaningful vectors directly into a model's hidden states
during inference. It is often framed as a precise, interpretable, and
potentially safer alternative to fine-tuning. We demonstrate the opposite:
steering systematically breaks model alignment safeguards, making it comply
with harmful requests. Through extensive experiments on different model
families, we show that even steering in a random direction can increase the
probability of harmful compliance from 0% to 2-27%. Alarmingly, steering benign
features from a sparse autoencoder (SAE), a common source of interpretable
directions, increases these rates by a further 2-4%. Finally, we show that
combining 20 randomly sampled vectors that jailbreak a single prompt creates a
universal attack, significantly increasing harmful compliance on unseen
requests. These results challenge the paradigm of safety through
interpretability, showing that precise control over model internals does not
guarantee precise control over model behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于线性假设的代理模型方法严重低估了SGD的非线性复杂性，限制了梯度反演攻击的有效性。

Method: 提出非线性代理模型扩展(NL-SME)，用可学习的二次贝塞尔曲线替代线性插值，通过控制点捕捉SGD的曲线特性，结合正则化和dvec缩放机制增强表达能力。

Result: 在CIFAR-100和FEMNIST数据集上的实验表明，NL-SME在所有指标上都显著优于基线方法，余弦相似度损失实现数量级改进，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了联邦学习多步更新范式中的隐私脆弱性，并为开发鲁棒防御策略提供了新视角。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) preserves privacy by keeping raw data local, yet
Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs) pose significant threats. In FedAVG
multi-step scenarios, attackers observe only aggregated gradients, making data
reconstruction challenging. Existing surrogate model methods like SME assume
linear parameter trajectories, but we demonstrate this severely underestimates
SGD's nonlinear complexity, fundamentally limiting attack effectiveness. We
propose Non-Linear Surrogate Model Extension (NL-SME), the first method to
introduce nonlinear parametric trajectory modeling for GIAs. Our approach
replaces linear interpolation with learnable quadratic B\'ezier curves that
capture SGD's curved characteristics through control points, combined with
regularization and dvec scaling mechanisms for enhanced expressiveness.
Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and FEMNIST datasets show NL-SME
significantly outperforms baselines across all metrics, achieving
order-of-magnitude improvements in cosine similarity loss while maintaining
computational efficiency.This work exposes heightened privacy vulnerabilities
in FL's multi-step update paradigm and offers novel perspectives for developing
robust defense strategies.

Kirchhoff Forests, a class of random spanning forests used to construct
stochastic multi-resolution decompositions of graphs. SHAKE-GNN produces
multi-scale representations, enabling flexible trade-offs between efficiency
and performance. We introduce an improved, data-driven strategy for selecting
the trade-off parameter and analyse the time-complexity of SHAKE-GNN.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注模型更新的鲁棒性，但忽视了追索建议的时间动态特性，特别是在竞争性资源受限环境中，建议会影响未来申请者群体。

Method: 引入时间感知的算法追索框架，建模候选人群对建议的适应性反应；提出基于强化学习的追索算法，捕捉环境演化动态，生成可行且有效的建议。

Conclusion: 将时间和行为动态纳入实际追索系统设计具有重要意义，提出的方法能够生成持久有效的建议，让个体有信心在实施建议后重新申请。

Abstract: Algorithmic recourse seeks to provide individuals with actionable
recommendations that increase their chances of receiving favorable outcomes
from automated decision systems (e.g., loan approvals). While prior research
has emphasized robustness to model updates, considerably less attention has
been given to the temporal dynamics of recourse--particularly in competitive,
resource-constrained settings where recommendations shape future applicant
pools. In this work, we present a novel time-aware framework for algorithmic
recourse, explicitly modeling how candidate populations adapt in response to
recommendations. Additionally, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning
(RL)-based recourse algorithm that captures the evolving dynamics of the
environment to generate recommendations that are both feasible and valid. We
design our recommendations to be durable, supporting validity over a predefined
time horizon T. This durability allows individuals to confidently reapply after
taking time to implement the suggested changes. Through extensive experiments
in complex simulation environments, we show that our approach substantially
outperforms existing baselines, offering a superior balance between feasibility
and long-term validity. Together, these results underscore the importance of
incorporating temporal and behavioral dynamics into the design of practical
recourse systems.

Abstract: Psychological attributes rarely operate in isolation: coaches reason about
networks of related traits. We analyze a new dataset of 164 female volleyball
players from Italy's C and D leagues that combines standardized psychological
profiling with background information. To learn directed relationships among
mixed-type variables (ordinal questionnaire scores, categorical demographics,
continuous indicators), we introduce latent MMHC, a hybrid structure learner
that couples a latent Gaussian copula and a constraint-based skeleton with a
constrained score-based refinement to return a single DAG. We also study a
bootstrap-aggregated variant for stability. In simulations spanning sample
size, sparsity, and dimension, latent Max-Min Hill-Climbing (MMHC) attains
lower structural Hamming distance and higher edge recall than recent
copula-based learners while maintaining high specificity. Applied to
volleyball, the learned network organizes mental skills around goal setting and
self-confidence, with emotional arousal linking motivation and anxiety, and
locates Big-Five traits (notably neuroticism and extraversion) upstream of
skill clusters. Scenario analyses quantify how improvements in specific skills
propagate through the network to shift preparation, confidence, and
self-esteem. The approach provides an interpretable, data-driven framework for
profiling psychological traits in sport and for decision support in athlete
development.

Result: 该方法能够有效建模回归场景中的对抗性规避攻击，提升预测模型的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了对抗性机器学习在回归场景中的空白，为回归模型的对抗性防御提供了新的理论框架。

Abstract: Adversarial machine learning challenges the assumption that the underlying
distribution remains consistent throughout the training and implementation of a
prediction model. In particular, adversarial evasion considers scenarios where
adversaries adapt their data to influence particular outcomes from established
prediction models, such scenarios arise in applications such as spam email
filtering, malware detection and fake-image generation, where security methods
must be actively updated to keep up with the ever-improving generation of
malicious data. Game theoretic models have been shown to be effective at
modelling these scenarios and hence training resilient predictors against such
adversaries. Recent advancements in the use of pessimistic bilevel optimsiation
which remove assumptions about the convexity and uniqueness of the adversary's
optimal strategy have proved to be particularly effective at mitigating threats
to classifiers due to its ability to capture the antagonistic nature of the
adversary. However, this formulation has not yet been adapted to regression
scenarios. This article serves to propose a pessimistic bilevel optimisation
program for regression scenarios which makes no assumptions on the convexity or
uniqueness of the adversary's solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无评论家方法如GRPO虽然降低了内存需求，但由于缺乏关键学习信号且包含大量无信息样本和token，导致收敛速度缓慢。

Method: D$^3$S框架包含两个层级：样本级选择优势方差最大的rollouts子集，token级选择优势幅度与策略熵乘积高的token。采用动态下采样调度防止过拟合。

Result: 在Qwen2.5和Llama3.1上的实验表明，D$^3$S集成到先进RL算法中实现了最先进的性能和泛化能力，同时需要更少的样本和token。

Conclusion: D$^3$S框架通过动态双级下采样有效提升了无评论家方法的效率和性能，在推理基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Critic-free methods like GRPO reduce memory demands by estimating advantages
from multiple rollouts but tend to converge slowly, as critical learning
signals are diluted by an abundance of uninformative samples and tokens. To
tackle this challenge, we propose the \textbf{Dynamic Dual-Level Down-Sampling
(D$^3$S)} framework that prioritizes the most informative samples and tokens
across groups to improve the efficient of policy optimization. D$^3$S operates
along two levels: (1) the sample-level, which selects a subset of rollouts to
maximize advantage variance ($\text{Var}(A)$). We theoretically proven that
this selection is positively correlated with the upper bound of the policy
gradient norms, yielding higher policy gradients. (2) the token-level, which
prioritizes tokens with a high product of advantage magnitude and policy
entropy ($|A_{i,t}|\times H_{i,t}$), focusing updates on tokens where the
policy is both uncertain and impactful. Moreover, to prevent overfitting to
high-signal data, D$^3$S employs a dynamic down-sampling schedule inspired by
curriculum learning. This schedule starts with aggressive down-sampling to
accelerate early learning and gradually relaxes to promote robust
generalization. Extensive experiments on Qwen2.5 and Llama3.1 demonstrate that
integrating D$^3$S into advanced RL algorithms achieves state-of-the-art
performance and generalization while requiring \textit{fewer} samples and
tokens across diverse reasoning benchmarks. Our code is added in the
supplementary materials and will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: VITAL是一个基于大语言模型的框架，专门用于处理电子健康记录中不规则采样的生理时间序列数据，通过区分生命体征和实验室测试两种变量类型，分别采用不同的编码策略来应对数据缺失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录中的时间序列数据存在不规则采样和高缺失率的问题，临床变量根据工作流程和干预时间以不均匀间隔测量，这给建模带来了挑战。

Method: VITAL区分生命体征和实验室测试两种变量类型：将生命体征重新编程到语言空间，使LLM能够捕获时间上下文并通过显式编码处理缺失值；实验室变量则根据可用性使用代表性汇总值或可学习的[未测量]标记进行嵌入。

Result: 在PhysioNet基准数据集上的广泛评估表明，VITAL优于为不规则时间序列设计的最先进方法，并在高缺失率情况下保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: VITAL框架有效解决了电子健康记录中不规则采样时间序列的建模挑战，特别适用于真实临床场景中关键变量经常不可用的情况。

Abstract: Irregular sampling and high missingness are intrinsic challenges in modeling
time series derived from electronic health records (EHRs),where clinical
variables are measured at uneven intervals depending on workflow and
intervention timing. To address this, we propose VITAL, a variable-aware, large
language model (LLM) based framework tailored for learning from irregularly
sampled physiological time series. VITAL differentiates between two distinct
types of clinical variables: vital signs, which are frequently recorded and
exhibit temporal patterns, and laboratory tests, which are measured
sporadically and lack temporal structure. It reprograms vital signs into the
language space, enabling the LLM to capture temporal context and reason over
missing values through explicit encoding. In contrast, laboratory variables are
embedded either using representative summary values or a learnable [Not
measured] token, depending on their availability. Extensive evaluations on the
benchmark datasets from the PhysioNet demonstrate that VITAL outperforms state
of the art methods designed for irregular time series. Furthermore, it
maintains robust performance under high levels of missingness, which is
prevalent in real world clinical scenarios where key variables are often
unavailable.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的切片WoW加速方法依赖参数化元度量或高阶矩的存在，导致数值不稳定性和计算成本高。

Method: 利用1维Wasserstein空间与分位数函数空间L2([0,1])之间的等距性，引入基于高斯过程参数化的无限维L2投影的切片框架，结合欧几里得单位球上的经典积分。

Result: 数值实验验证DSW在数据集、形状和图像上作为WoW距离的可扩展替代方案的有效性。

Conclusion: DSW避免了不稳定的高阶矩，实现了计算节省，同时保持了对离散化元度量的WoW最小化等价性。

Abstract: Wasserstein distances define a metric between probability measures on
arbitrary metric spaces, including meta-measures (measures over measures). The
resulting Wasserstein over Wasserstein (WoW) distance is a powerful, but
computationally costly tool for comparing datasets or distributions over images
and shapes. Existing sliced WoW accelerations rely on parametric meta-measures
or the existence of high-order moments, leading to numerical instability. As an
alternative, we propose to leverage the isometry between the 1d Wasserstein
space and the quantile functions in the function space $L_2([0,1])$. For this
purpose, we introduce a general sliced Wasserstein framework for arbitrary
Banach spaces. Due to the 1d Wasserstein isometry, this framework defines a
sliced distance between 1d meta-measures via infinite-dimensional
$L_2$-projections, parametrized by Gaussian processes. Combining this 1d
construction with classical integration over the Euclidean unit sphere yields
the double-sliced Wasserstein (DSW) metric for general meta-measures. We show
that DSW minimization is equivalent to WoW minimization for discretized
meta-measures, while avoiding unstable higher-order moments and computational
savings. Numerical experiments on datasets, shapes, and images validate DSW as
a scalable substitute for the WoW distance.

Conclusion: 所提出的正则化方法能有效同时解决平滑量化中的两个关键问题，在多个任务上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Vector quantization, which discretizes a continuous vector space into a
finite set of representative vectors (a codebook), has been widely adopted in
modern machine learning. Despite its effectiveness, vector quantization poses a
fundamental challenge: the non-differentiable quantization step blocks gradient
backpropagation. Smoothed vector quantization addresses this issue by relaxing
the hard assignment of a codebook vector into a weighted combination of
codebook entries, represented as the matrix product of a simplex vector and the
codebook. Effective smoothing requires two properties: (1) smoothed quantizers
should remain close to a onehot vector, ensuring tight approximation, and (2)
all codebook entries should be utilized, preventing code collapse. Existing
methods typically address these desiderata separately. By contrast, the present
study introduces a simple and intuitive regularization that promotes both
simultaneously by minimizing the distance between each simplex vertex and its
$K$-nearest smoothed quantizers. Experiments on representative benchmarks,
including discrete image autoencoding and contrastive speech representation
learning, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves more reliable codebook
utilization and improves performance compared to prior approaches.

the focus on sparsification techniques. While semi-structured (N:M) pruning is
well-established for weights, its application to activation pruning remains
underexplored despite its potential for dynamic, input-adaptive compression and
reductions in I/O overhead. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of
methods for post-training N:M activation pruning in LLMs. Across multiple LLMs,
we demonstrate that pruning activations enables superior preservation of
generative capabilities compared to weight pruning at equivalent sparsity
levels. We evaluate lightweight, plug-and-play error mitigation techniques and
pruning criteria, establishing strong hardware-friendly baselines that require
minimal calibration. Furthermore, we explore sparsity patterns beyond NVIDIA's
standard 2:4, showing that the 16:32 pattern achieves performance nearly on par
with unstructured sparsity. However, considering the trade-off between
flexibility and hardware implementation complexity, we focus on the 8:16
pattern as a superior candidate. Our findings provide both effective practical
methods for activation pruning and a motivation for future hardware to support
more flexible sparsity patterns. Our code is available

*Durgesh Kalwar,Mayank Baranwal,Harshad Khadilkar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DYNAWEIGHT是一个用于多智能体网络信息聚合的新框架，通过动态分配权重来加速去中心化学习，在数据异构场景下特别有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在完全去中心化基础设施中，由于缺乏集中聚合，本地处理变得至关重要。传统静态权重分配方法无法有效处理数据异构性，需要更智能的聚合方案。

Method: DYNAWEIGHT动态地基于相邻服务器在本地数据集上的相对损失来分配权重，优先选择具有多样化信息的服务器，而不是使用传统的静态权重（如Metropolis权重）。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR10和CIFAR100数据集上的实验表明，DYNAWEIGHT在各种服务器数量和图拓扑结构下都能显著提高训练速度，且通信和内存开销最小。

Conclusion: DYNAWEIGHT作为一种聚合方案，与任何底层服务器级优化算法兼容，具有广泛的适用性和集成潜力，特别适合数据异构的去中心化学习场景。

Abstract: In today's data-sensitive landscape, distributed learning emerges as a vital
tool, not only fortifying privacy measures but also streamlining computational
operations. This becomes especially crucial within fully decentralized
infrastructures where local processing is imperative due to the absence of
centralized aggregation. Here, we introduce DYNAWEIGHT, a novel framework to
information aggregation in multi-agent networks. DYNAWEIGHT offers substantial
acceleration in decentralized learning with minimal additional communication
and memory overhead. Unlike traditional static weight assignments, such as
Metropolis weights, DYNAWEIGHT dynamically allocates weights to neighboring
servers based on their relative losses on local datasets. Consequently, it
favors servers possessing diverse information, particularly in scenarios of
substantial data heterogeneity. Our experiments on various datasets MNIST,
CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 incorporating various server counts and graph topologies,
demonstrate notable enhancements in training speeds. Notably, DYNAWEIGHT
functions as an aggregation scheme compatible with any underlying server-level
optimization algorithm, underscoring its versatility and potential for
widespread integration.

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够有效从数据中发现对称群结构，并构建简化的等变模型，在多任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: In this study, we introduce a method for learning group (known or unknown)
equivariant functions by learning the associated quadratic form $x^T A x$
corresponding to the group from the data. Certain groups, known as orthogonal
groups, preserve a specific quadratic form, and we leverage this property to
uncover the underlying symmetry group under the assumption that it is
orthogonal. By utilizing the corresponding unique symmetric matrix and its
inherent diagonal form, we incorporate suitable inductive biases into the
neural network architecture, leading to models that are both simplified and
efficient. Our approach results in an invariant model that preserves norms,
while the equivariant model is represented as a product of a norm-invariant
model and a scale-invariant model, where the ``product'' refers to the group
action.
  Moreover, we extend our framework to a more general setting where the
function acts on tuples of input vectors via a diagonal (or product) group
action. In this extension, the equivariant function is decomposed into an
angular component extracted solely from the normalized first vector and a
scale-invariant component that depends on the full Gram matrix of the tuple.
This decomposition captures the inter-dependencies between multiple inputs
while preserving the underlying group symmetry.
  We assess the effectiveness of our framework across multiple tasks, including
polynomial regression, top quark tagging, and moment of inertia matrix
prediction. Comparative analysis with baseline methods demonstrates that our
model consistently excels in both discovering the underlying symmetry and
efficiently learning the corresponding equivariant function.

Result: 证明了每种独立性准则都能在非线性、不可逆混合下实现潜在子空间的可识别性，并建立了这些准则之间的层次关系。

Conclusion: 该框架阐明了在不依赖统计假设的情况下解耦表示可识别的条件，为解耦学习提供了新的理论基础。

Abstract: Disentangled representations seek to recover latent factors of variation
underlying observed data, yet their identifiability is still not fully
understood. We introduce a unified framework in which disentanglement is
achieved through mechanistic independence, which characterizes latent factors
by how they act on observed variables rather than by their latent distribution.
This perspective is invariant to changes of the latent density, even when such
changes induce statistical dependencies among factors. Within this framework,
we propose several related independence criteria -- ranging from support-based
and sparsity-based to higher-order conditions -- and show that each yields
identifiability of latent subspaces, even under nonlinear, non-invertible
mixing. We further establish a hierarchy among these criteria and provide a
graph-theoretic characterization of latent subspaces as connected components.
Together, these results clarify the conditions under which disentangled
representations can be identified without relying on statistical assumptions.

Abstract: A regression-based framework for interpretable multi-way data imputation,
termed Kernel Regression via Tensor Trains with Hadamard overparametrization
(KReTTaH), is introduced. KReTTaH adopts a nonparametric formulation by casting
imputation as regression via reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Parameter
efficiency is achieved through tensors of fixed tensor-train (TT) rank, which
reside on low-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, and is further enhanced via
Hadamard overparametrization, which promotes sparsity within the TT parameter
space. Learning is accomplished by solving a smooth inverse problem posed on
the Riemannian manifold of fixed TT-rank tensors. As a representative
application, the estimation of dynamic graph flows is considered. In this
setting, KReTTaH exhibits flexibility by seamlessly incorporating graph-based
(topological) priors via its inverse problem formulation. Numerical tests on
real-world graph datasets demonstrate that KReTTaH consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art alternatives-including a nonparametric tensor- and a
neural-network-based methods-for imputing missing, time-varying edge flows.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: R-GNS是一个可逆图网络模拟器，通过残差可逆消息传递和共享参数，在单一图架构中实现双向一致性，统一了前向模拟和逆推理，在耗散流体系统中实现了高效准确的目标导向轨迹生成。

Conclusion: R-GNS是首个统一耗散流体系统前向和逆模拟的可逆框架，能够生成复杂目标形状的物理一致轨迹，在准确性和效率方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Simulating physically plausible trajectories toward user-defined goals is a
fundamental yet challenging task in fluid dynamics. While particle-based
simulators can efficiently reproduce forward dynamics, inverse inference
remains difficult, especially in dissipative systems where dynamics are
irreversible and optimization-based solvers are slow, unstable, and often fail
to converge. In this work, we introduce the Reversible Graph Network Simulator
(R-GNS), a unified framework that enforces bidirectional consistency within a
single graph architecture. Unlike prior neural simulators that approximate
inverse dynamics by fitting backward data, R-GNS does not attempt to reverse
the underlying physics. Instead, we propose a mathematically invertible design
based on residual reversible message passing with shared parameters, coupling
forward dynamics with inverse inference to deliver accurate predictions and
efficient recovery of plausible initial states. Experiments on three
dissipative benchmarks (Water-3D, WaterRamps, and WaterDrop) show that R-GNS
achieves higher accuracy and consistency with only one quarter of the
parameters, and performs inverse inference more than 100 times faster than
optimization-based baselines. For forward simulation, R-GNS matches the speed
of strong GNS baselines, while in goal-conditioned tasks it eliminates
iterative optimization and achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups. On
goal-conditioned tasks, R-GNS further demonstrates its ability to complex
target shapes (e.g., characters "L" and "N") through vivid, physically
consistent trajectories. To our knowledge, this is the first reversible
framework that unifies forward and inverse simulation for dissipative fluid
systems.

Motivation: 研究深度学习模型的数据记忆现象，特别是从数据重建角度分析模型参数何时能泄露训练数据隐私。

Method: 在随机特征模型中分析特征空间训练样本子空间的信息量，提出基于优化的数据重建方法，并在多种架构上验证。

Result: 当p > dn时，可以从模型参数中成功重建训练数据集，揭示了数据重建的阈值规律。

Conclusion: 深度学习模型在参数数量超过特定阈值时会泄露训练数据隐私，这对模型隐私保护提出了重要警示。

Abstract: Large-scale deep learning models are known to memorize parts of the training
set. In machine learning theory, memorization is often framed as interpolation
or label fitting, and classical results show that this can be achieved when the
number of parameters $p$ in the model is larger than the number of training
samples $n$. In this work, we consider memorization from the perspective of
data reconstruction, demonstrating that this can be achieved when $p$ is larger
than $dn$, where $d$ is the dimensionality of the data. More specifically, we
show that, in the random features model, when $p \gg dn$, the subspace spanned
by the training samples in feature space gives sufficient information to
identify the individual samples in input space. Our analysis suggests an
optimization method to reconstruct the dataset from the model parameters, and
we demonstrate that this method performs well on various architectures (random
features, two-layer fully-connected and deep residual networks). Our results
reveal a law of data reconstruction, according to which the entire training
dataset can be recovered as $p$ exceeds the threshold $dn$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SO(n)的单参数子群在机器人学、量子力学和分子结构分析等应用中至关重要，需要自动发现这些子群的方法。

Method: 利用斜对称矩阵的标准Jordan形式建立轨道规范形式，通过参数学习揭示底层单参数子群Hγ。

Result: 在双摆建模、转动惯量预测、顶夸克标记和不变多项式回归等任务中成功恢复了有意义的子群结构，并产生了可解释的对称感知表示。

Conclusion: 该框架有效发现了SO(n)的单参数子群，并在多个应用中展示了其有效性，为对称性感知表示学习提供了新方法。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for the automatic discovery of one-parameter
subgroups ($H_{\gamma}$) of $SO(3)$ and, more generally, $SO(n)$. One-parameter
subgroups of $SO(n)$ are crucial in a wide range of applications, including
robotics, quantum mechanics, and molecular structure analysis. Our method
utilizes the standard Jordan form of skew-symmetric matrices, which define the
Lie algebra of $SO(n)$, to establish a canonical form for orbits under the
action of $H_{\gamma}$. This canonical form is then employed to derive a
standardized representation for $H_{\gamma}$-invariant functions. By learning
the appropriate parameters, the framework uncovers the underlying one-parameter
subgroup $H_{\gamma}$. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is
demonstrated through tasks such as double pendulum modeling, moment of inertia
prediction, top quark tagging and invariant polynomial regression, where it
successfully recovers meaningful subgroup structure and produces interpretable,
symmetry-aware representations.

Motivation: 现实世界序列决策问题需要平衡性能与公平性，但理想的权衡难以预先确定，需要提供多种权衡选项供利益相关者选择。

Method: 提出扩展的马尔可夫决策过程fMDP，显式编码个体和群体信息，构建公平性框架计算时序公平度量，使用强化学习算法探索性能-公平性权衡。

Result: 在招聘和欺诈检测场景中，框架学习的策略在多种情况下更公平，仅带来轻微性能损失，且发现群体公平和个体公平并不必然相互蕴含。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效平衡序列决策中的性能与公平性，为不同问题场景提供了应用指南，强调了同时考虑两种公平类型的价值。

Abstract: Equity in real-world sequential decision problems can be enforced using
fairness-aware methods. Therefore, we require algorithms that can make suitable
and transparent trade-offs between performance and the desired fairness
notions. As the desired performance-fairness trade-off is hard to specify a
priori, we propose a framework where multiple trade-offs can be explored.
Insights provided by the reinforcement learning algorithm regarding the
obtainable performance-fairness trade-offs can then guide stakeholders in
selecting the most appropriate policy. To capture fairness, we propose an
extended Markov decision process, $f$MDP, that explicitly encodes individuals
and groups. Given this $f$MDP, we formalise fairness notions in the context of
sequential decision problems and formulate a fairness framework that computes
fairness measures over time. We evaluate our framework in two scenarios with
distinct fairness requirements: job hiring, where strong teams must be composed
while treating applicants equally, and fraud detection, where fraudulent
transactions must be detected while ensuring the burden on customers is fairly
distributed. We show that our framework learns policies that are more fair
across multiple scenarios, with only minor loss in performance reward.
Moreover, we observe that group and individual fairness notions do not
necessarily imply one another, highlighting the benefit of our framework in
settings where both fairness types are desired. Finally, we provide guidelines
on how to apply this framework across different problem settings.

Conclusion: ASSESS框架通过综合语义和结构信息，为形式化语句相似性评估提供了有效的连续评分方法，并在新基准上验证了其优越性能。

Abstract: Statement autoformalization, the automated translation of statements from
natural language into formal languages, has seen significant advancements, yet
the development of automated evaluation metrics remains limited. Existing
metrics for formal statement similarity often fail to balance semantic and
structural information. String-based approaches capture syntactic structure but
ignore semantic meaning, whereas proof-based methods validate semantic
equivalence but disregard structural nuances and, critically, provide no graded
similarity score in the event of proof failure. To address these issues, we
introduce ASSESS (A Semantic and Structural Evaluation Framework for Statement
Similarity), which comprehensively integrates semantic and structural
information to provide a continuous similarity score. Our framework first
transforms formal statements into Operator Trees to capture their syntactic
structure and then computes a similarity score using our novel TransTED
(Transformation Tree Edit Distance) Similarity metric, which enhances
traditional Tree Edit Distance by incorporating semantic awareness through
transformations. For rigorous validation, we present EPLA (Evaluating
Provability and Likeness for Autoformalization), a new benchmark of 524
expert-annotated formal statement pairs derived from miniF2F and ProofNet, with
labels for both semantic provability and structural likeness. Experiments on
EPLA demonstrate that TransTED Similarity outperforms existing methods,
achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and the highest Kappa coefficient. The
benchmark, and implementation code will be made public soon.

recovering the latter in the special case of grid graphs. WIRE also enjoys a
host of desirable theoretical properties, including equivariance under node
ordering permutation, compatibility with linear attention, and (under select
assumptions) asymptotic dependence on graph resistive distance. We test WIRE on
a range of synthetic and real-world tasks, including identifying monochromatic
subgraphs, semantic segmentation of point clouds, and more standard graph
benchmarks. We find it to be effective in settings where the underlying graph
structure is important.

Conclusion: 研究强调了开发鲁棒且忠实的遗忘方法对于语言模型安全部署的必要性。

Abstract: Large language models trained on web-scale data can memorize private or
sensitive knowledge, raising significant privacy risks. Although some
unlearning methods mitigate these risks, they remain vulnerable to "relearning"
during subsequent training, allowing a substantial portion of forgotten
knowledge to resurface. In this paper, we show that widely used unlearning
methods cause shallow alignment: instead of faithfully erasing target
knowledge, they generate spurious unlearning neurons that amplify negative
influence to hide it. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Ssiuu, a new
class of unlearning methods that employs attribution-guided regularization to
prevent spurious negative influence and faithfully remove target knowledge.
Experimental results confirm that our method reliably erases target knowledge
and outperforms strong baselines across two practical retraining scenarios: (1)
adversarial injection of private data, and (2) benign attack using an
instruction-following benchmark. Our findings highlight the necessity of robust
and faithful unlearning methods for safe deployment of language models.

Abstract: Reliable detection of bearing faults is essential for maintaining the safety
and operational efficiency of rotating machinery. While recent advances in
machine learning (ML), particularly deep learning, have shown strong
performance in controlled settings, many studies fail to generalize to
real-world applications due to methodological flaws, most notably data leakage.
This paper investigates the issue of data leakage in vibration-based bearing
fault diagnosis and its impact on model evaluation. We demonstrate that common
dataset partitioning strategies, such as segment-wise and condition-wise
splits, introduce spurious correlations that inflate performance metrics. To
address this, we propose a rigorous, leakage-free evaluation methodology
centered on bearing-wise data partitioning, ensuring no overlap between the
physical components used for training and testing. Additionally, we reformulate
the classification task as a multi-label problem, enabling the detection of
co-occurring fault types and the use of prevalence-independent metrics such as
Macro AUROC. Beyond preventing leakage, we also examine the effect of dataset
diversity on generalization, showing that the number of unique training
bearings is a decisive factor for achieving robust performance. We evaluate our
methodology on three widely adopted datasets: CWRU, Paderborn University (PU),
and University of Ottawa (UORED-VAFCLS). This study highlights the importance
of leakage-aware evaluation protocols and provides practical guidelines for
dataset partitioning, model selection, and validation, fostering the
development of more trustworthy ML systems for industrial fault diagnosis
applications.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated in diverse
applications, obtaining reliable measures of their predictive uncertainty has
become critically important. A precise distinction between aleatoric
uncertainty, arising from inherent ambiguities within input data, and epistemic
uncertainty, originating exclusively from model limitations, is essential to
effectively address each uncertainty source. In this paper, we introduce
Spectral Uncertainty, a novel approach to quantifying and decomposing
uncertainties in LLMs. Leveraging the Von Neumann entropy from quantum
information theory, Spectral Uncertainty provides a rigorous theoretical
foundation for separating total uncertainty into distinct aleatoric and
epistemic components. Unlike existing baseline methods, our approach
incorporates a fine-grained representation of semantic similarity, enabling
nuanced differentiation among various semantic interpretations in model
responses. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Spectral Uncertainty
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in estimating both aleatoric and total
uncertainty across diverse models and benchmark datasets.

Result: 在五个下游任务上的综合实验表明PatchMoE达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: PatchMoE通过任务感知的路由策略和时空相关性建模，成功提升了MoE在时间序列分析中的适应性和性能表现。

Abstract: Time Series Analysis is widely used in various real-world applications such
as weather forecasting, financial fraud detection, imputation for missing data
in IoT systems, and classification for action recognization. Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE), as a powerful architecture, though demonstrating effectiveness in NLP,
still falls short in adapting to versatile tasks in time series analytics due
to its task-agnostic router and the lack of capability in modeling channel
correlations. In this study, we propose a novel, general MoE-based time series
framework called PatchMoE to support the intricate ``knowledge'' utilization
for distinct tasks, thus task-aware. Based on the observation that hierarchical
representations often vary across tasks, e.g., forecasting vs. classification,
we propose a Recurrent Noisy Gating to utilize the hierarchical information in
routing, thus obtaining task-sepcific capability. And the routing strategy is
operated on time series tokens in both temporal and channel dimensions, and
encouraged by a meticulously designed Temporal \& Channel Load Balancing Loss
to model the intricate temporal and channel correlations. Comprehensive
experiments on five downstream tasks demonstrate the state-of-the-art
performance of PatchMoE.

Conclusion: 扩散自编码器为无线语义通信提供了有效的解决方案，能够更好地建模信号分布，解决传统方法的可扩展性问题，并在多用户场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) systems aim to learn the mapping from
low-dimensional semantics to high-dimensional ground-truth. While this is more
akin to a "domain translation" problem, existing frameworks typically emphasize
on channel-adaptive neural encoding-decoding schemes, lacking full exploration
of signal distribution. Moreover, such methods so far have employed
autoencoder-based architectures, where the encoding is tightly coupled to a
matched decoder, causing scalability issues in practice. To address these gaps,
diffusion autoencoder models are proposed for wireless SemCom. The goal is to
learn a "semantic-to-clean" mapping, from the semantic space to the
ground-truth probability distribution. A neural encoder at semantic transmitter
extracts the high-level semantics, and a conditional diffusion model (CDiff) at
the semantic receiver exploits the source distribution for signal-space
denoising, while the received semantic latents are incorporated as the
conditioning input to "steer" the decoding process towards the semantics
intended by the transmitter. It is analytically proved that the proposed
decoder model is a consistent estimator of the ground-truth data. Furthermore,
extensive simulations over CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets are provided along with
design insights, highlighting the performance compared to legacy autoencoders
and variational autoencoders (VAE). Simulations are further extended to the
multi-user SemCom, identifying the dominating factors in a more realistic
setup.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于多目标非凸约束松弛模型的高效超图划分框架，使用改进的加速近端梯度算法生成多样化顶点特征，结合MST策略和细化策略，在多个基准测试中优于现有划分器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有超图划分方法容易陷入局部最优且划分质量有待提升，需要开发能避免局部最优、提高划分质量的高效算法。

Method: 采用多目标非凸约束松弛模型和加速近端梯度算法生成顶点特征；设计两种MST策略：小规模数据用Prim算法构建MST后剪枝聚类，大规模数据选择代表节点构建小MST并分配剩余节点；引入贪心迁移、交换和递归MST聚类等细化策略。

Result: 在2、3、4路划分中平均比KaHyPar减少2%-5%的割集大小，特定实例提升达35%；在加权顶点集上优于KaHyPar、hMetis、Mt-KaHyPar和K-SpecPart；细化策略使hMetis划分提升达16%。

Conclusion: 所提算法在划分质量上优于现有先进方法，具有竞争力和优越性能，通过虚拟实例方法和参数敏感性分析验证了其有效性。

Abstract: This paper proposes an efficient hypergraph partitioning framework based on a
novel multi-objective non-convex constrained relaxation model. A modified
accelerated proximal gradient algorithm is employed to generate diverse
$k$-dimensional vertex features to avoid local optima and enhance partition
quality. Two MST-based strategies are designed for different data scales: for
small-scale data, the Prim algorithm constructs a minimum spanning tree
followed by pruning and clustering; for large-scale data, a subset of
representative nodes is selected to build a smaller MST, while the remaining
nodes are assigned accordingly to reduce complexity. To further improve
partitioning results, refinement strategies including greedy migration,
swapping, and recursive MST-based clustering are introduced for partitions.
  Experimental results on public benchmark sets demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm achieves reductions in cut size of approximately 2\%--5\% on average
compared to KaHyPar in 2, 3, and 4-way partitioning, with improvements of up to
35\% on specific instances. Particularly on weighted vertex sets, our algorithm
outperforms state-of-the-art partitioners including KaHyPar, hMetis,
Mt-KaHyPar, and K-SpecPart, highlighting its superior partitioning quality and
competitiveness. Furthermore, the proposed refinement strategy improves hMetis
partitions by up to 16\%. A comprehensive evaluation based on virtual instance
methodology and parameter sensitivity analysis validates the algorithm's
competitiveness and characterizes its performance trade-offs.

TL;DR: Aurora是一个多模态时间序列基础模型，支持多模态输入和零样本推理，通过模态引导的注意力机制和原型引导的流匹配方法，在跨域时间序列预测中实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在局限性：单模态时间序列基础模型无法显式利用文本等模态中的领域特定知识；端到端多模态监督模型不支持跨域场景的零样本推理。需要开发支持多模态输入和零样本推理的时间序列基础模型。

Method: 通过分词、编码和蒸馏提取多模态领域知识，使用模态引导的多头自注意力机制将知识注入时间表示建模，在解码阶段采用原型引导的流匹配进行生成式概率预测。

Result: 在TimeMMD、TSFM-Bench和ProbTS等基准测试中，Aurora在单模态和多模态场景下均展现出持续的最先进性能。

Conclusion: Aurora通过有效利用多模态领域知识，实现了强大的跨域泛化能力，为时间序列预测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-domain generalization is very important in Time Series Forecasting
because similar historical information may lead to distinct future trends due
to the domain-specific characteristics. Recent works focus on building unimodal
time series foundation models and end-to-end multimodal supervised models.
Since domain-specific knowledge is often contained in modalities like texts,
the former lacks the explicit utilization of them, thus hindering the
performance. The latter is tailored for end-to-end scenarios and does not
support zero-shot inference for cross-domain scenarios. In this work, we
introduce Aurora, a Multimodal Time Series Foundation Model, which supports
multimodal inputs and zero-shot inference. Pretrained on Corss-domain
Multimodal Time Series Corpus, Aurora can adaptively extract and focus on key
domain knowledge contained in corrsponding text or image modalities, thus
possessing strong Cross-domain generalization capability. Through tokenization,
encoding, and distillation, Aurora can extract multimodal domain knowledge as
guidance and then utilizes a Modality-Guided Multi-head Self-Attention to
inject them into the modeling of temporal representations. In the decoding
phase, the multimodal representations are used to generate the conditions and
prototypes of future tokens, contributing to a novel Prototype-Guided Flow
Matching for generative probabilistic forecasting. Comprehensive experiments on
well-recognized benchmarks, including TimeMMD, TSFM-Bench and ProbTS,
demonstrate the consistent state-of-the-art performance of Aurora on both
unimodal and multimodal scenarios.

TL;DR: HEAPr是一种新颖的MoE模型剪枝算法，通过将专家分解为原子专家，利用二阶信息进行精确剪枝，显著降低内存需求同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE架构虽然性能优异且推理成本低，但参数量大导致内存需求过高，现有专家级剪枝方法粒度太粗会导致精度显著下降。

Method: 将专家分解为原子专家，利用类似OBS理论的二阶信息衡量重要性，通过变换和简化将空间复杂度从O(d^4)降至O(d^2)，仅需少量计算即可完成剪枝。

Conclusion: HEAPr通过原子专家剪枝和高效二阶信息计算，为MoE模型提供了高精度、高效率的压缩解决方案。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures in large language models (LLMs)
deliver exceptional performance and reduced inference costs compared to dense
LLMs. However, their large parameter counts result in prohibitive memory
requirements, limiting practical deployment. While existing pruning methods
primarily focus on expert-level pruning, this coarse granularity often leads to
substantial accuracy degradation. In this work, we introduce HEAPr, a novel
pruning algorithm that decomposes experts into smaller, indivisible atomic
experts, enabling more precise and flexible atomic expert pruning. To measure
the importance of each atomic expert, we leverage second-order information
based on principles similar to Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) theory. To address
the computational and storage challenges posed by second-order information,
HEAPr exploits the inherent properties of atomic experts to transform the
second-order information from expert parameters into that of atomic expert
parameters, and further simplifies it to the second-order information of atomic
expert outputs. This approach reduces the space complexity from $O(d^4)$, where
d is the model's dimensionality, to $O(d^2)$. HEAPr requires only two forward
passes and one backward pass on a small calibration set to compute the
importance of atomic experts. Extensive experiments on MoE models, including
DeepSeek MoE and Qwen MoE family, demonstrate that HEAPr outperforms existing
expert-level pruning methods across a wide range of compression ratios and
benchmarks. Specifically, HEAPr achieves nearly lossless compression at
compression ratios of 20% ~ 25% in most models, while also reducing FLOPs
nearly by 20%. The code can be found at

Result: 在预测产率任务中，SoDaDE优于之前的表示方法，证明了小数据集也能创建有效的数据驱动指纹。

Conclusion: 数据驱动指纹可以用小数据集创建，并建立了可扩展到其他应用的工作流程。

Abstract: Computational representations have become crucial in unlocking the recent
growth of machine learning algorithms for chemistry. Initially hand-designed,
machine learning has shown that meaningful representations can be learnt from
data. Chemical datasets are limited and so the representations learnt from data
are generic, being trained on broad datasets which contain shallow information
on many different molecule types. For example, generic fingerprints lack
physical context specific to solvents. However, the use of harmful solvents is
a leading climate-related issue in the chemical industry, and there is a surge
of interest in green solvent replacement. To empower this research, we propose
a new solvent representation scheme by developing Solvent Data Driven
Embeddings (SoDaDE). SoDaDE uses a small transformer model and solvent property
dataset to create a fingerprint for solvents. To showcase their effectiveness,
we use SoDaDE to predict yields on a recently published dataset, outperforming
previous representations. We demonstrate through this paper that data-driven
fingerprints can be made with small datasets and set-up a workflow that can be
explored for other applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习需要大量交互数据，实际部署受限。现有方法利用先验知识但面临训练与部署任务不匹配的问题，特别是在分布外设置下表现不佳。

Method: APB方法在共享骨干网络前后插入轻量级线性层，实现参数高效微调，在适应新任务时保持先验知识。

Result: APB相比标准RL提高了样本效率，在分布外任务上表现优于现有元RL基线方法。

Conclusion: APB通过参数高效微调机制有效解决了任务不匹配问题，特别是在分布外场景下展现出优越的适应能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved impressive results across domains,
yet learning an optimal policy typically requires extensive interaction data,
limiting practical deployment. A common remedy is to leverage priors, such as
pre-collected datasets or reference policies, but their utility degrades under
task mismatch between training and deployment. While prior work has sought to
address this mismatch, it has largely been restricted to in-distribution
settings. To address this challenge, we propose Adaptive Policy Backbone (APB),
a meta-transfer RL method that inserts lightweight linear layers before and
after a shared backbone, thereby enabling parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) while preserving prior knowledge during adaptation. Our results show
that APB improves sample efficiency over standard RL and adapts to
out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks where existing meta-RL baselines typically
fail.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出渐进式权重加载(PWL)方法，通过先部署轻量学生模型，然后逐步替换为预训练教师模型的层，在保持初始推理速度的同时渐进提升精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型越来越大，导致内存消耗和计算需求增加，模型加载时间和初始推理延迟在移动和延迟敏感环境中成为挑战。知识蒸馏虽然能压缩模型但通常以性能下降为代价。

Method: PWL技术首先部署轻量学生模型，然后增量替换其层为预训练教师模型的层。引入训练方法对齐学生和教师层的中间特征表示，并提升学生模型的整体输出性能。

Result: 在VGG、ResNet和ViT架构上的实验表明，PWL训练的模型保持竞争力的蒸馏性能，随着教师层加载逐步提升精度，最终达到完整教师模型的精度而不影响初始推理速度。

Conclusion: PWL特别适合动态、资源受限的部署场景，在响应性和性能都至关重要的环境中表现出色。

Abstract: Deep learning models have become increasingly large and complex, resulting in
higher memory consumption and computational demands. Consequently, model
loading times and initial inference latency have increased, posing significant
challenges in mobile and latency-sensitive environments where frequent model
loading and unloading are required, which directly impacts user experience.
While Knowledge Distillation (KD) offers a solution by compressing large
teacher models into smaller student ones, it often comes at the cost of reduced
performance. To address this trade-off, we propose Progressive Weight Loading
(PWL), a novel technique that enables fast initial inference by first deploying
a lightweight student model, then incrementally replacing its layers with those
of a pre-trained teacher model. To support seamless layer substitution, we
introduce a training method that not only aligns intermediate feature
representations between student and teacher layers, but also improves the
overall output performance of the student model. Our experiments on VGG,
ResNet, and ViT architectures demonstrate that models trained with PWL maintain
competitive distillation performance and gradually improve accuracy as teacher
layers are loaded-matching the final accuracy of the full teacher model without
compromising initial inference speed. This makes PWL particularly suited for
dynamic, resource-constrained deployments where both responsiveness and
performance are critical.

Motivation: 研究深度神经网络在持续学习中为何会失去学习新任务的能力，而不需要重新初始化参数。

Method: 引入τ-可训练性概念，基于Hessian的Kronecker分解近似，提出了保持高有效特征秩和应用L2惩罚两种正则化增强方法。

Result: 在持续监督学习和强化学习任务上的实验表明，结合这两种正则化器能有效保持网络的可塑性。

Conclusion: Hessian谱崩溃是深度持续学习中可塑性丧失的根本原因，通过针对性的正则化方法可以有效解决这一问题。

Abstract: We investigate why deep neural networks suffer from \emph{loss of plasticity}
in deep continual learning, failing to learn new tasks without reinitializing
parameters. We show that this failure is preceded by Hessian spectral collapse
at new-task initialization, where meaningful curvature directions vanish and
gradient descent becomes ineffective. To characterize the necessary condition
for successful training, we introduce the notion of $\tau$-trainability and
show that current plasticity preserving algorithms can be unified under this
framework. Targeting spectral collapse directly, we then discuss the Kronecker
factored approximation of the Hessian, which motivates two regularization
enhancements: maintaining high effective feature rank and applying $L2$
penalties. Experiments on continual supervised and reinforcement learning tasks
confirm that combining these two regularizers effectively preserves plasticity.

Conclusion: SurvDiff是首个专门为生成合成生存数据设计的扩散模型，能够有效复现真实的事件时间分布并保持删失机制。

Abstract: Survival analysis is a cornerstone of clinical research by modeling
time-to-event outcomes such as metastasis, disease relapse, or patient death.
Unlike standard tabular data, survival data often come with incomplete event
information due to dropout, or loss to follow-up. This poses unique challenges
for synthetic data generation, where it is crucial for clinical research to
faithfully reproduce both the event-time distribution and the censoring
mechanism. In this paper, we propose SurvDiff, an end-to-end diffusion model
specifically designed for generating synthetic data in survival analysis.
SurvDiff is tailored to capture the data-generating mechanism by jointly
generating mixed-type covariates, event times, and right-censoring, guided by a
survival-tailored loss function. The loss encodes the time-to-event structure
and directly optimizes for downstream survival tasks, which ensures that
SurvDiff (i) reproduces realistic event-time distributions and (ii) preserves
the censoring mechanism. Across multiple datasets, we show that \survdiff
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art generative baselines in both
distributional fidelity and downstream evaluation metrics across multiple
medical datasets. To the best of our knowledge, SurvDiff is the first diffusion
model explicitly designed for generating synthetic survival data.

Conclusion: 这些发现展示了自我适应世界模型的潜力，并突出了ICEL出现的关键因素，特别是长上下文和多样化环境的必要性。

Abstract: The capability of predicting environmental dynamics underpins both biological
neural systems and general embodied AI in adapting to their surroundings. Yet
prevailing approaches rest on static world models that falter when confronted
with novel or rare configurations. We investigate in-context environment
learning (ICEL), shifting attention from zero-shot performance to the growth
and asymptotic limits of the world model. Our contributions are three-fold: (1)
we formalize in-context learning of a world model and identify two core
mechanisms: environment recognition and environment learning; (2) we derive
error upper-bounds for both mechanisms that expose how the mechanisms emerge;
and (3) we empirically confirm that distinct ICL mechanisms exist in the world
model, and we further investigate how data distribution and model architecture
affect ICL in a manner consistent with theory. These findings demonstrate the
potential of self-adapting world models and highlight the key factors behind
the emergence of ICEL, most notably the necessity of long context and diverse
environments.

TL;DR: 提出随机激活策略，在LLM前馈层中随机选择SILU或RELU非线性函数，解决RELU的梯度流问题，可用于预训练和生成任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RELU激活函数在负输入区域梯度消失的问题，同时利用RELU的稀疏性优势来减少推理计算量。

Method: 在前馈层中使用伯努利分布随机选择SILU或RELU激活函数，预训练时使用随机激活，微调时固定为RELU用于推理。

Result: 相比从头训练RELU模型效果更好，推理时FLOPs减少且CPU速度显著提升；在生成任务中表现合理，略逊于最佳确定性非线性SILU。

Conclusion: 随机激活策略提供了一种平衡训练稳定性和推理效率的方法，同时为文本生成提供了增加多样性的可控途径。

Abstract: We introduce stochastic activations. This novel strategy randomly selects
between several non-linear functions in the feed-forward layer of a large
language model. In particular, we choose between SILU or RELU depending on a
Bernoulli draw. This strategy circumvents the optimization problem associated
with RELU, namely, the constant shape for negative inputs that prevents the
gradient flow. We leverage this strategy in two ways:
  (1) We use stochastic activations during pre-training and fine-tune the model
with RELU, which is used at inference time to provide sparse latent vectors.
This reduces the inference FLOPs and translates into a significant speedup in
the CPU. Interestingly, this leads to much better results than training from
scratch with the RELU activation function.
  (2) We evaluate stochastic activations for generation. This strategy performs
reasonably well: it is only slightly inferior to the best deterministic
non-linearity, namely SILU combined with temperature scaling. This offers an
alternative to existing strategies by providing a controlled way to increase
the diversity of the generated text.

Abstract: Deep neural networks learn feature representations via complex geometric
transformations of the input data manifold. Despite the models' empirical
success across domains, our understanding of neural feature representations is
still incomplete. In this work we investigate neural feature geometry through
the lens of discrete geometry. Since the input data manifold is typically
unobserved, we approximate it using geometric graphs that encode local
similarity structure. We provide theoretical results on the evolution of these
graphs during training, showing that nonlinear activations play a crucial role
in shaping feature geometry in feedforward neural networks. Moreover, we
discover that the geometric transformations resemble a discrete Ricci flow on
these graphs, suggesting that neural feature geometry evolves analogous to
Ricci flow. This connection is supported by experiments on over 20,000
feedforward neural networks trained on binary classification tasks across both
synthetic and real-world datasets. We observe that the emergence of class
separability corresponds to the emergence of community structure in the
associated graph representations, which is known to relate to discrete Ricci
flow dynamics. Building on these insights, we introduce a novel framework for
locally evaluating geometric transformations through comparison with discrete
Ricci flow dynamics. Our results suggest practical design principles, including
a geometry-informed early-stopping heuristic and a criterion for selecting
network depth.

Result: 实验结果表明，LALMs通常能生成忠实于其底层决策过程的思维链表示。

Conclusion: 与文本LLMs不同，LALMs产生的思维链在多个数据集和任务中表现出较高的忠实性，这对安全敏感应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Faithfulness measures whether chain-of-thought (CoT) representations
accurately reflect a model's decision process and can be used as reliable
explanations. Prior work has shown that CoTs from text-based LLMs are often
unfaithful. This question has not been explored for large audio-language models
(LALMs), where faithfulness is critical for safety-sensitive applications.
Reasoning in LALMs is also more challenging, as models must first extract
relevant clues from audio before reasoning over them. In this paper, we
investigate the faithfulness of CoTs produced by several LALMs by applying
targeted interventions, including paraphrasing, filler token injection, early
answering, and introducing mistakes, on two challenging reasoning datasets:
SAKURA and MMAR. After going through the aforementioned interventions across
several datasets and tasks, our experiments suggest that, LALMs generally
produce CoTs that appear to be faithful to their underlying decision processes.

*Bo Wang,Imran Khan,Martin White,Natalia Beloff*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种联邦多模态钓鱼网站检测器，支持URL、HTML和图像输入，客户端可以在推理时调用任何训练好的模态头。通过基于FedProx的角色感知桶聚合和硬门控专家选择，实现了稳定的联邦训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中多模态检测的挑战，允许客户端灵活使用不同模态进行推理，同时保护用户隐私，避免跨模态嵌入冲突。

Method: 在FedProx基础上提出角色感知桶聚合，采用硬门控选择图像/HTML/URL专家，分别聚合模态特定参数。使用GraphCodeBERT处理URL，三路嵌入处理原始HTML。

Result: 在TR-OP数据集上，融合头达到97.5%准确率和2.4%误报率；图像子集达到95.5%准确率和5.9%误报率；WebPhish(HTML)达到96.5%准确率和1.8%误报率；TR-OP(原始HTML)达到95.1%准确率和4.6%误报率。

Conclusion: 桶聚合与硬门控专家机制能够在严格隐私保护下实现稳定的联邦训练，同时提高多模态钓鱼检测的可用性和灵活性。

Abstract: We present a federated, multi-modal phishing website detector that supports
URL, HTML, and IMAGE inputs without binding clients to a fixed modality at
inference: any client can invoke any modality head trained elsewhere.
Methodologically, we propose role-aware bucket aggregation on top of FedProx,
inspired by Mixture-of-Experts and FedMM. We drop learnable routing and use
hard gating (selecting the IMAGE/HTML/URL expert by sample modality), enabling
separate aggregation of modality-specific parameters to isolate cross-embedding
conflicts and stabilize convergence. On TR-OP, the Fusion head reaches Acc
97.5% with FPR 2.4% across two data types; on the image subset (ablation) it
attains Acc 95.5% with FPR 5.9%. For text, we use GraphCodeBERT for URLs and an
early three-way embedding for raw, noisy HTML. On WebPhish (HTML) we obtain Acc
96.5% / FPR 1.8%; on TR-OP (raw HTML) we obtain Acc 95.1% / FPR 4.6%. Results
indicate that bucket aggregation with hard-gated experts enables stable
federated training under strict privacy, while improving the usability and
flexibility of multi-modal phishing detection.

TL;DR: 提出一个综合元学习框架，结合多种机器学习方法，用于信用风险管理和金融实体分类，显著提升了信用评级迁移和违约概率预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习方法在处理高维数据、可解释性差、罕见事件检测和多类别不平衡问题时面临挑战，需要更稳健的信用风险预测模型。

Method: 采用元学习框架，整合监督学习算法（XGBoost、随机森林、SVM、决策树）、无监督方法（KNN）、深度学习架构（多层感知机）、LASSO正则化特征选择，以及纠错输出码作为元分类器处理不平衡多类别问题。

Result: 在美国2099家上市公司信用评级数据集上的实证验证表明，该框架显著提升了金融实体分类的准确性，特别是在信用评级迁移和违约概率估计方面。

Conclusion: 该研究为战略金融决策支持开发了更准确可靠的计算模型，解决了信用风险建模中的三个基本挑战。

Abstract: Effective credit risk management is fundamental to financial decision-making,
necessitating robust models for default probability prediction and financial
entity classification. Traditional machine learning approaches face significant
challenges when confronted with high-dimensional data, limited
interpretability, rare event detection, and multi-class imbalance problems in
risk assessment. This research proposes a comprehensive meta-learning framework
that synthesizes multiple complementary models: supervised learning algorithms,
including XGBoost, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree;
unsupervised methods such as K-Nearest Neighbors; deep learning architectures
like Multilayer Perceptron; alongside LASSO regularization for feature
selection and dimensionality reduction; and Error-Correcting Output Codes as a
meta-classifier for handling imbalanced multi-class problems. We implement
Permutation Feature Importance analysis for each prediction class across all
constituent models to enhance model transparency. Our framework aims to
optimize predictive performance while providing a more holistic approach to
credit risk assessment. This research contributes to the development of more
accurate and reliable computational models for strategic financial decision
support by addressing three fundamental challenges in credit risk modeling. The
empirical validation of our approach involves an analysis of the Corporate
Credit Ratings dataset with credit ratings for 2,029 publicly listed US
companies. Results demonstrate that our meta-learning framework significantly
enhances the accuracy of financial entity classification regarding credit
rating migrations (upgrades and downgrades) and default probability estimation.

Motivation: 深度神经网络在实际AI应用中广泛使用，但其内部结构和复杂性使其难以解释。模型透明度和可解释性在许多高性能不足以采用解决方案的场景中是关键要求。

Method: 将可微分的L0正则化近似方法应用于多层逻辑感知器(MLLP)，并与随机二值化等替代启发式方法进行比较，研究基于损失函数而非随机分布的网络稀疏化技术。

Result: 讨论了CRS复杂度与其性能之间的权衡关系，比较了不同稀疏化方法的效果。

Conclusion: 使用基于损失函数的稀疏化技术相比随机方法可以获得更好的结果，在保持性能的同时有效降低可解释模型的复杂度。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are widely used in practical applications of AI,
however, their inner structure and complexity made them generally not easily
interpretable. Model transparency and interpretability are key requirements for
multiple scenarios where high performance is not enough to adopt the proposed
solution. In this work, a differentiable approximation of $L_0$ regularization
is adapted into a logic-based neural network, the Multi-layer Logical
Perceptron (MLLP), to study its efficacy in reducing the complexity of its
discrete interpretable version, the Concept Rule Set (CRS), while retaining its
performance. The results are compared to alternative heuristics like Random
Binarization of the network weights, to determine if better results can be
achieved when using a less-noisy technique that sparsifies the network based on
the loss function instead of a random distribution. The trade-off between the
CRS complexity and its performance is discussed.

Motivation: 利率下降和经济稳定化提高了死亡率预测的重要性，特别是在保险和养老金市场。多步预测对公共卫生、人口规划和保险风险评估至关重要，但在数据有限时面临挑战。

Method: 使用混合系统结合统计和机器学习模型处理线性和非线性模式，评估了递归、直接和多输入多输出三种多步预测方法以及多种ML模型。

Conclusion: 多步预测方法和ML模型的选择对混合系统性能有显著影响，ARIMA-LSTM混合模型结合递归方法在死亡率预测中表现最优。

Abstract: The decline in interest rates and economic stabilization has heightened the
importance of accurate mortality rate forecasting, particularly in insurance
and pension markets. Multi-step-ahead predictions are crucial for public
health, demographic planning, and insurance risk assessments; however, they
face challenges when data are limited. Hybrid systems that combine statistical
and Machine Learning (ML) models offer a promising solution for handling both
linear and nonlinear patterns. This study evaluated the impact of different
multi-step forecasting approaches (Recursive, Direct, and Multi-Input
Multi-Output) and ML models on the accuracy of hybrid systems. Results from 12
datasets and 21 models show that the selection of both the multi-step approach
and the ML model is essential for improving performance, with the ARIMA-LSTM
hybrid using a recursive approach outperforming other models in most cases.

TL;DR: MoveFM-R是一个结合移动基础模型和大型语言模型的新框架，通过语义增强位置编码、渐进式课程学习和交互式自反机制，解决地理坐标与语言词汇不匹配的问题，显著提升人类移动轨迹生成的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有移动基础模型在数据规模和语义理解上存在局限，而大型语言模型虽然语义推理能力强，但缺乏时空统计理解能力，无法生成物理上合理的移动轨迹。

Method: 提出三个核心创新：语义增强位置编码来弥合地理-语言鸿沟，渐进式课程学习来对齐LLM推理与移动模式，交互式自反机制用于条件轨迹生成。

Result: 大量实验表明MoveFM-R显著优于现有的MFM和LLM基线方法，在零样本设置下表现出强大的泛化能力，并能从自然语言指令生成真实轨迹。

Conclusion: 通过融合MFMs的统计能力和LLMs的深度语义理解，MoveFM-R开创了更全面、可解释和强大的人类移动建模新范式。

Abstract: Mobility Foundation Models (MFMs) have advanced the modeling of human
movement patterns, yet they face a ceiling due to limitations in data scale and
semantic understanding. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful
semantic reasoning, they lack the innate understanding of spatio-temporal
statistics required for generating physically plausible mobility trajectories.
To address these gaps, we propose MoveFM-R, a novel framework that unlocks the
full potential of mobility foundation models by leveraging language-driven
semantic reasoning capabilities. It tackles two key challenges: the vocabulary
mismatch between continuous geographic coordinates and discrete language
tokens, and the representation gap between the latent vectors of MFMs and the
semantic world of LLMs. MoveFM-R is built on three core innovations: a
semantically enhanced location encoding to bridge the geography-language gap, a
progressive curriculum to align the LLM's reasoning with mobility patterns, and
an interactive self-reflection mechanism for conditional trajectory generation.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoveFM-R significantly outperforms
existing MFM-based and LLM-based baselines. It also shows robust generalization
in zero-shot settings and excels at generating realistic trajectories from
natural language instructions. By synthesizing the statistical power of MFMs
with the deep semantic understanding of LLMs, MoveFM-R pioneers a new paradigm
that enables a more comprehensive, interpretable, and powerful modeling of
human mobility. The implementation of MoveFM-R is available online at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MoveFM-R-CDE7/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管晶格玻尔兹曼方程在捕捉复杂流动行为方面很成功，但由于碰撞核施加的严格时间步长限制，数值求解仍然计算密集。

Method: 引入物理信息神经网络算子框架，结合LBE的内在矩匹配约束和全分布场的全局等变性，实现离散化不变性，可在粗网格上训练并在细网格上泛化。

Result: 该框架在复杂流动场景中表现出鲁棒性，包括冯卡门涡街、韧带断裂和气泡粘附等案例。

Conclusion: 为建模动力学系统建立了一条新的数据驱动途径，适用于不同碰撞模型和动力学数据集。

Abstract: The lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE), rooted in kinetic theory, provides a
powerful framework for capturing complex flow behaviour by describing the
evolution of single-particle distribution functions (PDFs). Despite its
success, solving the LBE numerically remains computationally intensive due to
strict time-step restrictions imposed by collision kernels. Here, we introduce
a physics-informed neural operator framework for the LBE that enables
prediction over large time horizons without step-by-step integration,
effectively bypassing the need to explicitly solve the collision kernel. We
incorporate intrinsic moment-matching constraints of the LBE, along with global
equivariance of the full distribution field, enabling the model to capture the
complex dynamics of the underlying kinetic system. Our framework is
discretization-invariant, enabling models trained on coarse lattices to
generalise to finer ones (kinetic super-resolution). In addition, it is
agnostic to the specific form of the underlying collision model, which makes it
naturally applicable across different kinetic datasets regardless of the
governing dynamics. Our results demonstrate robustness across complex flow
scenarios, including von Karman vortex shedding, ligament breakup, and bubble
adhesion. This establishes a new data-driven pathway for modelling kinetic
systems.

Motivation: 现有GPL方法存在两个关键局限：(1)缺乏对底层机制的共识，不同提示策略在模型的不同空间进行干预；(2)场景适应性有限，难以在数据分布变化时泛化。

Method: 提出UniPrompt方法，通过理论分析揭示表示级提示本质上等同于微调简单下游分类器，主张GPL应专注于释放预训练模型能力，让分类器适应下游场景。

Result: 大量实验表明，UniPrompt能有效整合各种预训练模型，在领域内和跨领域场景中均取得强劲性能。

Conclusion: 图提示学习应聚焦于释放预训练模型潜力，UniPrompt通过保持输入图结构实现了这一目标，在多样化下游场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Graph Prompt Learning (GPL) has emerged as a promising paradigm that bridges
graph pretraining models and downstream scenarios, mitigating label dependency
and the misalignment between upstream pretraining and downstream tasks.
Although existing GPL studies explore various prompt strategies, their
effectiveness and underlying principles remain unclear. We identify two
critical limitations: (1) Lack of consensus on underlying mechanisms: Despite
current GPLs have advanced the field, there is no consensus on how prompts
interact with pretrained models, as different strategies intervene at varying
spaces within the model, i.e., input-level, layer-wise, and
representation-level prompts. (2) Limited scenario adaptability: Most methods
fail to generalize across diverse downstream scenarios, especially under data
distribution shifts (e.g., homophilic-to-heterophilic graphs). To address these
issues, we theoretically analyze existing GPL approaches and reveal that
representation-level prompts essentially function as fine-tuning a simple
downstream classifier, proposing that graph prompt learning should focus on
unleashing the capability of pretrained models, and the classifier adapts to
downstream scenarios. Based on our findings, we propose UniPrompt, a novel GPL
method that adapts any pretrained models, unleashing the capability of
pretrained models while preserving the structure of the input graph. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method can effectively integrate with various
pretrained models and achieve strong performance across in-domain and
cross-domain scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分布式训练方法通过减少全局同步频率来降低通信成本，但仍有改进空间。本文旨在进一步提高训练效率，减少内存使用和计算量。

Method: 在本地更新步骤中，每个节点只更新固定的参数子集，其余参数保持冻结。同时保持完整的正向传播以避免节点间激活值交换。

Result: 在32个节点上训练13亿参数语言模型的实验表明，该方法在相同token和带宽预算下达到与现有方法相当的困惑度，同时减少了训练FLOPs和峰值内存使用。

Conclusion: 通过限制反向传播范围，可以显著提高分布式训练的效率，在保持模型质量的同时降低计算和内存开销。

Abstract: We introduce a memory- and compute-efficient method for low-communication
distributed training. Existing methods reduce communication by performing
multiple local updates between infrequent global synchronizations. We
demonstrate that their efficiency can be significantly improved by restricting
backpropagation: instead of updating all the parameters, each node updates only
a fixed subset while keeping the remainder frozen during local steps. This
constraint substantially reduces peak memory usage and training FLOPs, while a
full forward pass over all parameters eliminates the need for cross-node
activation exchange. Experiments on a $1.3$B-parameter language model trained
across $32$ nodes show that our method matches the perplexity of prior
low-communication approaches under identical token and bandwidth budgets while
reducing training FLOPs and peak memory.

Motivation: 现有持久同调计算方法如Vietoris-Rips complex在处理大规模点云数据时面临计算复杂度指数增长的问题，限制了其在下游机器学习任务中的应用。

Method: 引入Flood complex，基于Alpha complex和Witness complex的思想，通过Delaunay三角剖分子集点云，并包含被半径为r的球完全覆盖的单纯形，这一过程称为"flooding"。

Result: 在3D点云数据上的扩展实验表明，该方法能在数百万点云上计算到2维的持久同调。在真实世界和合成数据的物体分类任务中，性能优于其他基于持久同调的方法和点云神经网络。

Conclusion: Flood complex为大规模点云数据的持久同调计算提供了高效可扩展的解决方案，特别适用于几何或拓扑复杂的物体，在物体分类任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: We consider the problem of computing persistent homology (PH) for large-scale
Euclidean point cloud data, aimed at downstream machine learning tasks, where
the exponential growth of the most widely-used Vietoris-Rips complex imposes
serious computational limitations. Although more scalable alternatives such as
the Alpha complex or sparse Rips approximations exist, they often still result
in a prohibitively large number of simplices. This poses challenges in the
complex construction and in the subsequent PH computation, prohibiting their
use on large-scale point clouds. To mitigate these issues, we introduce the
Flood complex, inspired by the advantages of the Alpha and Witness complex
constructions. Informally, at a given filtration value $r\geq 0$, the Flood
complex contains all simplices from a Delaunay triangulation of a small subset
of the point cloud $X$ that are fully covered by balls of radius $r$ emanating
from $X$, a process we call flooding. Our construction allows for efficient PH
computation, possesses several desirable theoretical properties, and is
amenable to GPU parallelization. Scaling experiments on 3D point cloud data
show that we can compute PH of up to dimension 2 on several millions of points.
Importantly, when evaluating object classification performance on real-world
and synthetic data, we provide evidence that this scaling capability is needed,
especially if objects are geometrically or topologically complex, yielding
performance superior to other PH-based methods and neural networks for point
cloud data.

Conclusion: 激活函数的平滑性和非线性是神经ODE训练成功的关键因素，为实际应用中的扩展提供了实用指导，可能带来更快的训练和更好的性能。

Abstract: Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) have been successful in various
applications due to their continuous nature and parameter-sharing efficiency.
However, these unique characteristics also introduce challenges in training,
particularly with respect to gradient computation accuracy and convergence
analysis. In this paper, we address these challenges by investigating the
impact of activation functions. We demonstrate that the properties of
activation functions, specifically smoothness and nonlinearity, are critical to
the training dynamics. Smooth activation functions guarantee globally unique
solutions for both forward and backward ODEs, while sufficient nonlinearity is
essential for maintaining the spectral properties of the Neural Tangent Kernel
(NTK) during training. Together, these properties enable us to establish the
global convergence of Neural ODEs under gradient descent in overparameterized
regimes. Our theoretical findings are validated by numerical experiments, which
not only support our analysis but also provide practical guidelines for scaling
Neural ODEs, potentially leading to faster training and improved performance in
real-world applications.

Conclusion: 通过提供具有强渐近保证的描述长度目标理论框架，为训练实现更好压缩和泛化的神经网络指明了潜在路径。

Abstract: The Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle offers a formal framework for
applying Occam's razor in machine learning. However, its application to neural
networks such as Transformers is challenging due to the lack of a principled,
universal measure for model complexity. This paper introduces the theoretical
notion of asymptotically optimal description length objectives, grounded in the
theory of Kolmogorov complexity. We establish that a minimizer of such an
objective achieves optimal compression, for any dataset, up to an additive
constant, in the limit as model resource bounds increase. We prove that
asymptotically optimal objectives exist for Transformers, building on a new
demonstration of their computational universality. We further show that such
objectives can be tractable and differentiable by constructing and analyzing a
variational objective based on an adaptive Gaussian mixture prior. Our
empirical analysis shows that this variational objective selects for a
low-complexity solution with strong generalization on an algorithmic task, but
standard optimizers fail to find such solutions from a random initialization,
highlighting key optimization challenges. More broadly, by providing a
theoretical framework for identifying description length objectives with strong
asymptotic guarantees, we outline a potential path towards training neural
networks that achieve greater compression and generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PFGM++等静电生成模型虽然性能优异，但依赖昂贵的ODE模拟生成样本，计算成本高。需要开发有效的蒸馏方法来加速采样过程。

Method: 将蒸馏重新表述为逆问题：学习一个生成器，使其诱导的静电场与教师模型匹配。推导了可处理的训练目标，当D→∞时与SiD方法一致。

Result: IPFM生成的蒸馏模型仅需少量函数评估即可达到接近甚至优于教师模型的样本质量。有限D值下的蒸馏收敛速度比扩散模型极限更快。

Conclusion: IPFM是有效的静电生成模型蒸馏框架，能显著加速采样过程，且有限D值的PFGM++模型具有更优的优化和采样特性。

Abstract: Electrostatic generative models such as PFGM++ have recently emerged as a
powerful framework, achieving state-of-the-art performance in image synthesis.
PFGM++ operates in an extended data space with auxiliary dimensionality $D$,
recovering the diffusion model framework as $D\to\infty$, while yielding
superior empirical results for finite $D$. Like diffusion models, PFGM++ relies
on expensive ODE simulations to generate samples, making it computationally
costly. To address this, we propose Inverse Poisson Flow Matching (IPFM), a
novel distillation framework that accelerates electrostatic generative models
across all values of $D$. Our IPFM reformulates distillation as an inverse
problem: learning a generator whose induced electrostatic field matches that of
the teacher. We derive a tractable training objective for this problem and show
that, as $D \to \infty$, our IPFM closely recovers Score Identity Distillation
(SiD), a recent method for distilling diffusion models. Empirically, our IPFM
produces distilled generators that achieve near-teacher or even superior sample
quality using only a few function evaluations. Moreover, we observe that
distillation converges faster for finite $D$ than in the $D \to \infty$
(diffusion) limit, which is consistent with prior findings that finite-$D$
PFGM++ models exhibit more favorable optimization and sampling properties.

Abstract: Physics-informed graph neural networks (PIGNNs) have emerged as fast AC
power-flow solvers that can replace classic Newton--Raphson (NR) solvers,
especially when thousands of scenarios must be evaluated. However, current
PIGNNs still need accuracy improvements at parity speed; in particular, the
physics loss is inoperative at inference, which can deter operational adoption.
We address this with PIGNN-Attn-LS, combining an edge-aware attention mechanism
that explicitly encodes line physics via per-edge biases, capturing the grid's
anisotropy, with a backtracking line-search-based globalized correction
operator that restores an operative decrease criterion at inference. Training
and testing use a realistic High-/Medium-Voltage scenario generator, with NR
used only to construct reference states. On held-out HV cases consisting of
4--32-bus grids, PIGNN-Attn-LS achieves a test RMSE of 0.00033 p.u. in voltage
and 0.08$^\circ$ in angle, outperforming the PIGNN-MLP baseline by 99.5\% and
87.1\%, respectively. With streaming micro-batches, it delivers 2--5$\times$
faster batched inference than NR on 4--1024-bus grids.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种在GPU上优化训练神经网络的新方法，通过将神经网络视为"灰盒"，仅暴露输入输出给优化求解器，相比传统方法能显著提升求解速度和减少迭代次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化方法将神经网络的所有中间变量和约束暴露给求解器，导致求解效率低下。本文旨在开发更高效的优化方法，利用GPU加速神经网络输出和导数的计算。

Method: 采用缩减空间公式化方法，将神经网络视为"灰盒"，只向优化求解器暴露输入和输出，中间变量和约束不暴露。这种方法在GPU上计算神经网络的输出和导数。

Result: 与全空间公式化相比，缩减空间方法在内部点法中实现了更快的求解速度和更少的迭代次数。在两个优化问题上验证了方法的有效性：MNIST图像分类器的对抗生成和具有神经网络安全约束的最优潮流问题。

Conclusion: 缩减空间公式化方法为优化训练神经网络提供了更高效的解决方案，特别适合需要频繁计算神经网络输出和导数的应用场景。

Abstract: We propose a reduced-space formulation for optimizing over trained neural
networks where the network's outputs and derivatives are evaluated on a GPU. To
do this, we treat the neural network as a "gray box" where intermediate
variables and constraints are not exposed to the optimization solver. Compared
to the full-space formulation, in which intermediate variables and constraints
are exposed to the optimization solver, the reduced-space formulation leads to
faster solves and fewer iterations in an interior point method. We demonstrate
the benefits of this method on two optimization problems: Adversarial
generation for a classifier trained on MNIST images and security-constrained
optimal power flow with transient feasibility enforced using a neural network
surrogate.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了IIET（迭代隐式欧拉Transformer）和IIAD（迭代影响感知蒸馏）方法，通过简化高阶数值方法来解决Transformer性能与效率的权衡问题，在提升准确率的同时显著降低推理开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高阶数值方法虽然能提升Transformer在NLP和CV任务中的性能，但带来了计算开销增加的性能-效率权衡问题。传统效率技术（如蒸馏）可能对这些模型性能产生负面影响。

Method: 使用迭代隐式欧拉方法简化高阶方法，提出IIET架构；引入IIAD蒸馏方法，通过灵活阈值平衡性能与效率权衡。

Result: 在lm-evaluation-harness上，IIET比普通Transformer平均准确率提升2.65%，比PCformer提升0.8%；高效变体E-IIET减少55%推理开销，保留99.4%原始任务准确率；最高效变体在可比速度下比普通Transformer性能提升超过1.6%。

Conclusion: IIET和IIAD方法有效解决了高阶Transformer的性能-效率权衡问题，实现了性能提升与推理效率的平衡。

Abstract: High-order numerical methods enhance Transformer performance in tasks like
NLP and CV, but introduce a performance-efficiency trade-off due to increased
computational overhead. Our analysis reveals that conventional efficiency
techniques, such as distillation, can be detrimental to the performance of
these models, exemplified by PCformer. To explore more optimizable ODE-based
Transformer architectures, we propose the \textbf{I}terative \textbf{I}mplicit
\textbf{E}uler \textbf{T}ransformer \textbf{(IIET)}, which simplifies
high-order methods using an iterative implicit Euler approach. This
simplification not only leads to superior performance but also facilitates
model compression compared to PCformer. To enhance inference efficiency, we
introduce \textbf{I}teration \textbf{I}nfluence-\textbf{A}ware
\textbf{D}istillation \textbf{(IIAD)}. Through a flexible threshold, IIAD
allows users to effectively balance the performance-efficiency trade-off. On
lm-evaluation-harness, IIET boosts average accuracy by 2.65\% over vanilla
Transformers and 0.8\% over PCformer. Its efficient variant, E-IIET,
significantly cuts inference overhead by 55\% while retaining 99.4\% of the
original task accuracy. Moreover, the most efficient IIET variant achieves an
average performance gain exceeding 1.6\% over vanilla Transformer with
comparable speed.

TL;DR: C-FREE是一个无需对比学习的自监督框架，通过整合2D分子图和3D构象集成来学习分子表示，在MoleculeNet上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分子表示学习方法依赖手工增强或复杂生成目标，且主要使用2D拓扑信息，未能充分利用有价值的3D结构信息。

Method: 使用固定半径的ego-nets作为建模单元，通过预测子图嵌入与其互补邻域的关系来学习表示，结合几何和拓扑信息于混合GNN-Transformer架构中。

Result: 在GEOM数据集上预训练后，在MoleculeNet上超越了对比学习、生成式和其他多模态自监督方法，达到最先进结果。

Conclusion: 3D信息增强的分子表示能有效迁移到新的化学领域，证明了3D结构信息对分子表示学习的重要性。

Abstract: High-quality molecular representations are essential for property prediction
and molecular design, yet large labeled datasets remain scarce. While
self-supervised pretraining on molecular graphs has shown promise, many
existing approaches either depend on hand-crafted augmentations or complex
generative objectives, and often rely solely on 2D topology, leaving valuable
3D structural information underutilized. To address this gap, we introduce
C-FREE (Contrast-Free Representation learning on Ego-nets), a simple framework
that integrates 2D graphs with ensembles of 3D conformers. C-FREE learns
molecular representations by predicting subgraph embeddings from their
complementary neighborhoods in the latent space, using fixed-radius ego-nets as
modeling units across different conformers. This design allows us to integrate
both geometric and topological information within a hybrid Graph Neural Network
(GNN)-Transformer backbone, without negatives, positional encodings, or
expensive pre-processing. Pretraining on the GEOM dataset, which provides rich
3D conformational diversity, C-FREE achieves state-of-the-art results on
MoleculeNet, surpassing contrastive, generative, and other multimodal
self-supervised methods. Fine-tuning across datasets with diverse sizes and
molecule types further demonstrates that pretraining transfers effectively to
new chemical domains, highlighting the importance of 3D-informed molecular
representations.

TL;DR: 该论文将高斯过程回归与动态模态分解相结合，解决了基于核的Koopman算子在稀疏性和超参数优化方面的两个主要问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Koopman算子作为非线性动力系统的线性表示方法，在科学领域受到广泛关注。但现有的基于核的Koopman算法存在两个普遍问题：计算复杂度高、对传感器噪声敏感，以及需要超参数优化和字典学习来适应动力系统。

Method: 将Koopman算子理论与再生核希尔伯特空间概念结合，并引入高斯过程方法。通过高斯过程回归减轻计算需求，提高对传感器噪声的鲁棒性，并改进超参数优化和字典学习过程。

Result: 该方法不仅降低了计算需求，还展示了对传感器噪声更强的鲁棒性。同时改进了模型适应动力系统的能力。

Conclusion: 本工作的主要贡献是将高斯过程回归与动态模态分解统一起来，为基于核的Koopman算法提供了更高效和鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: The Koopman operator, as a linear representation of a nonlinear dynamical
system, has been attracting attention in many fields of science. Recently,
Koopman operator theory has been combined with another concept that is popular
in data science: reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. We follow this thread into
Gaussian process methods, and illustrate how these methods can alleviate two
pervasive problems with kernel-based Koopman algorithms. The first being
sparsity: most kernel methods do not scale well and require an approximation to
become practical. We show that not only can the computational demands be
reduced, but also demonstrate improved resilience against sensor noise. The
second problem involves hyperparameter optimization and dictionary learning to
adapt the model to the dynamical system. In summary, the main contribution of
this work is the unification of Gaussian process regression and dynamic mode
decomposition.

TL;DR: 提出了OFMU，一种基于惩罚的双层优化框架，用于解决大语言模型中的机器遗忘问题，通过分层结构优先处理遗忘目标同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在敏感应用中部署的大语言模型需要能够遗忘特定知识（如用户请求、版权材料、过时信息），以满足监管合规、用户隐私和安全需求，而无需从头重新训练。

Method: 采用惩罚性双层优化框架，内层最大化步骤通过相似性感知惩罚强制遗忘，外层最小化步骤恢复模型效用，并开发了具有收敛保证的两环算法。

Result: 在视觉和语言基准测试中，OFMU在遗忘效果和保留效用方面始终优于现有遗忘方法，实现了更好的权衡。

Conclusion: OFMU通过明确优先处理遗忘目标并保持保留效用的分层结构，有效解决了机器遗忘中的梯度冲突问题，提供了可扩展且理论保证的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models deployed in sensitive applications increasingly require
the ability to unlearn specific knowledge, such as user requests, copyrighted
materials, or outdated information, without retraining from scratch to ensure
regulatory compliance, user privacy, and safety. This task, known as machine
unlearning, aims to remove the influence of targeted data (forgetting) while
maintaining performance on the remaining data (retention). A common approach is
to formulate this as a multi-objective problem and reduce it to a
single-objective problem via scalarization, where forgetting and retention
losses are combined using a weighted sum. However, this often results in
unstable training dynamics and degraded model utility due to conflicting
gradient directions. To address these challenges, we propose OFMU, a
penalty-based bi-level optimization framework that explicitly prioritizes
forgetting while preserving retention through a hierarchical structure. Our
method enforces forgetting via an inner maximization step that incorporates a
similarity-aware penalty to decorrelate the gradients of the forget and
retention objectives, and restores utility through an outer minimization step.
To ensure scalability, we develop a two-loop algorithm with provable
convergence guarantees under both convex and non-convex regimes. We further
provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of convergence rates and show that our
approach achieves better trade-offs between forgetting efficacy and model
utility compared to prior methods. Extensive experiments across vision and
language benchmarks demonstrate that OFMU consistently outperforms existing
unlearning methods in both forgetting efficacy and retained utility.

Abstract: We present a machine learning pipeline for biomarker discovery in Multiple
Sclerosis (MS), integrating eight publicly available microarray datasets from
Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC). After robust preprocessing we
trained an XGBoost classifier optimized via Bayesian search. SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP) were used to identify key features for model prediction,
indicating thus possible biomarkers. These were compared with genes identified
through classical Differential Expression Analysis (DEA). Our comparison
revealed both overlapping and unique biomarkers between SHAP and DEA,
suggesting complementary strengths. Enrichment analysis confirmed the
biological relevance of SHAP-selected genes, linking them to pathways such as
sphingolipid signaling, Th1/Th2/Th17 cell differentiation, and Epstein-Barr
virus infection all known to be associated with MS. This study highlights the
value of combining explainable AI (xAI) with traditional statistical methods to
gain deeper insights into disease mechanism.

Result: 证明对偶乐观方法能够线性收敛到所有局部解，并为乐观超参数调优提供原则性指导。

Conclusion: 我们的工作填补了对偶乐观方法经验成功与理论基础之间的关键空白。

Abstract: Constrained optimization is a powerful framework for enforcing requirements
on neural networks. These constrained deep learning problems are typically
solved using first-order methods on their min-max Lagrangian formulation, but
such approaches often suffer from oscillations and can fail to find all local
solutions. While the Augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) addresses these issues,
practitioners often favor dual optimistic ascent schemes (PI control) on the
standard Lagrangian, which perform well empirically but lack formal guarantees.
In this paper, we establish a previously unknown equivalence between these
approaches: dual optimistic ascent on the Lagrangian is equivalent to gradient
descent-ascent on the Augmented Lagrangian. This finding allows us to transfer
the robust theoretical guarantees of the ALM to the dual optimistic setting,
proving it converges linearly to all local solutions. Furthermore, the
equivalence provides principled guidance for tuning the optimism
hyper-parameter. Our work closes a critical gap between the empirical success
of dual optimistic methods and their theoretical foundation.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising decentralized learning
(DL) approach that enables the use of distributed data without compromising
user privacy. However, FL poses several key challenges. First, it is frequently
assumed that every client can train the same machine learning models, however,
not all clients are able to meet this assumption because of differences in
their business needs and computational resources. Second, statistical
heterogeneity (a.k.a. non-IID data) poses a major challenge in FL, which can
lead to lower global model performance. Third, while addressing these
challenges, there is a need for a cost-effective incentive mechanism to
encourage clients to participate in FL training. In response to these
challenges, we propose several methodologies: DL-SH, which facilitates
efficient, privacy-preserving, and communication-efficient learning in the
context of statistical heterogeneity; DL-MH, designed to manage fully
heterogeneous models while tackling statistical disparities; and I-DL-MH, an
incentive-based extension of DL-MH that promotes client engagement in federated
learning training by providing incentives within this complex federated
learning framework. Comprehensive experiments were carried out to assess the
performance and scalability of the proposed approaches across a range of
complex experimental settings. This involved utilizing various model
architectures, in diverse data distributions, including IID and several non-IID
scenarios, as well as multiple datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approaches significantly enhance accuracy and decrease
communication costs while effectively addressing statistical heterogeneity and
model heterogeneity in comparison to existing state-of-the-art approaches and
baselines, with DL-SH improving global model accuracy by 153%, and I-DL-MH
achieving a 225% improvement under non-IID conditions.

Motivation: 生成模型通常将连续数据和离散事件视为独立过程，但在复杂系统中它们会同步交互，需要统一建模框架来弥合这一差距。

Method: 提出JointDiff扩散框架，引入CrossGuid条件操作支持多智能体领域的可控生成，包括弱控球者引导和文本引导两种新场景。

Conclusion: 联合建模连续时空数据和同步离散事件是实现现实和可控生成模型的关键，JointDiff框架为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generative models often treat continuous data and discrete events as separate
processes, creating a gap in modeling complex systems where they interact
synchronously. To bridge this gap, we introduce JointDiff, a novel diffusion
framework designed to unify these two processes by simultaneously generating
continuous spatio-temporal data and synchronous discrete events. We demonstrate
its efficacy in the sports domain by simultaneously modeling multi-agent
trajectories and key possession events. This joint modeling is validated with
non-controllable generation and two novel controllable generation scenarios:
weak-possessor-guidance, which offers flexible semantic control over game
dynamics through a simple list of intended ball possessors, and text-guidance,
which enables fine-grained, language-driven generation. To enable the
conditioning with these guidance signals, we introduce CrossGuid, an effective
conditioning operation for multi-agent domains. We also share a new unified
sports benchmark enhanced with textual descriptions for soccer and football
datasets. JointDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating that
joint modeling is crucial for building realistic and controllable generative
models for interactive systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型EEG模型主要关注编码器，缺乏同等能力的解码器，限制了学习特征的充分利用。

Method: 将EEG建模重新定义为序列到序列学习，在序列空间中捕捉信号、标签和任务的分层关系，并引入离散支持样本构建上下文线索。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，即使使用基本模型组件，ECHO在多任务设置中始终优于最先进的单任务LEM，显示出卓越的泛化能力和适应性。

Conclusion: ECHO的解码器中心范式为EEG建模提供了新的方向，通过上下文学习实现动态适应异构任务，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG), with its broad range of applications,
necessitates models that can generalize effectively across various tasks and
datasets. Large EEG Models (LEMs) address this by pretraining encoder-centric
architectures on large-scale unlabeled data to extract universal
representations. While effective, these models lack decoders of comparable
capacity, limiting the full utilization of the learned features. To address
this issue, we introduce ECHO, a novel decoder-centric LEM paradigm that
reformulates EEG modeling as sequence-to-sequence learning. ECHO captures
layered relationships among signals, labels, and tasks within sequence space,
while incorporating discrete support samples to construct contextual cues. This
design equips ECHO with in-context learning, enabling dynamic adaptation to
heterogeneous tasks without parameter updates. Extensive experiments across
multiple datasets demonstrate that, even with basic model components, ECHO
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art single-task LEMs in multi-task
settings, showing superior generalization and adaptability.

Abstract: Bundle pricing refers to designing several product combinations (i.e.,
bundles) and determining their prices in order to maximize the expected profit.
It is a classic problem in revenue management and arises in many industries,
such as e-commerce, tourism, and video games. However, the problem is typically
intractable due to the exponential number of candidate bundles. In this paper,
we explore the usage of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in solving the
bundle pricing problem. Specifically, we first develop a graph representation
of the mixed bundling model (where every possible bundle is assigned with a
specific price) and then train a GCN to learn the latent patterns of optimal
bundles. Based on the trained GCN, we propose two inference strategies to
derive high-quality feasible solutions. A local-search technique is further
proposed to improve the solution quality. Numerical experiments validate the
effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed GCN-based framework. Using a GCN
trained on instances with 5 products, our methods consistently achieve
near-optimal solutions (better than 97%) with only a fraction of computational
time for problems of small to medium size. It also achieves superior solutions
for larger size of problems compared with other heuristic methods such as
bundle size pricing (BSP). The method can also provide high quality solutions
for instances with more than 30 products even for the challenging cases where
product utilities are non-additive.

TL;DR: 激活函数选择是缓解持续学习中可塑性损失的关键因素，作者提出了两种新的非线性激活函数（Smooth-Leaky和Randomized Smooth-Leaky），在监督学习和强化学习的持续学习场景中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在持续学习场景中，模型不仅面临灾难性遗忘问题，还会逐渐失去适应能力（可塑性损失），而激活函数在这种失效模式中的作用尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 基于负分支形状和饱和行为的属性分析，提出了两种即插即用的非线性激活函数，并在监督类增量基准和强化学习的非平稳环境中进行评估，同时提供了简单的压力测试协议和诊断方法。

Result: 研究表明，精心设计的激活函数能够在不增加额外容量或任务特定调优的情况下，持续维持持续学习中的可塑性。

Conclusion: 激活函数设计提供了一个轻量级、领域通用的方法来维持持续学习中的可塑性，是缓解可塑性损失的主要架构无关杠杆。

Abstract: In independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) training regimes, activation
functions have been benchmarked extensively, and their differences often shrink
once model size and optimization are tuned. In continual learning, however, the
picture is different: beyond catastrophic forgetting, models can progressively
lose the ability to adapt (referred to as loss of plasticity) and the role of
the non-linearity in this failure mode remains underexplored. We show that
activation choice is a primary, architecture-agnostic lever for mitigating
plasticity loss. Building on a property-level analysis of negative-branch shape
and saturation behavior, we introduce two drop-in nonlinearities (Smooth-Leaky
and Randomized Smooth-Leaky) and evaluate them in two complementary settings:
(i) supervised class-incremental benchmarks and (ii) reinforcement learning
with non-stationary MuJoCo environments designed to induce controlled
distribution and dynamics shifts. We also provide a simple stress protocol and
diagnostics that link the shape of the activation to the adaptation under
change. The takeaway is straightforward: thoughtful activation design offers a
lightweight, domain-general way to sustain plasticity in continual learning
without extra capacity or task-specific tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度强化学习存在样本效率低的问题，特别是在多任务设置中，这源于直接在冗余的高维参数空间中优化策略。

Method: 训练一个生成模型，通过行为重构损失将策略参数空间压缩到低维潜在空间，确保潜在空间按功能相似性而非参数邻近性组织。

Result: 在连续控制领域验证了方法有效性，标准策略网络的参数化可压缩高达五个数量级，同时保留大部分表达能力。

Conclusion: 学习到的流形使得在潜在空间中通过策略梯度进行任务特定适应成为可能，显著提升了样本效率。

Abstract: Despite its recent successes, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is
notoriously sample-inefficient. We argue that this inefficiency stems from the
standard practice of optimizing policies directly in the high-dimensional and
highly redundant parameter space $\Theta$. This challenge is greatly compounded
in multi-task settings. In this work, we develop a novel, unsupervised approach
that compresses the policy parameter space $\Theta$ into a low-dimensional
latent space $\mathcal{Z}$. We train a generative model
$g:\mathcal{Z}\to\Theta$ by optimizing a behavioral reconstruction loss, which
ensures that the latent space is organized by functional similarity rather than
proximity in parameterization. We conjecture that the inherent dimensionality
of this manifold is a function of the environment's complexity, rather than the
size of the policy network. We validate our approach in continuous control
domains, showing that the parameterization of standard policy networks can be
compressed up to five orders of magnitude while retaining most of its
expressivity. As a byproduct, we show that the learned manifold enables
task-specific adaptation via Policy Gradient operating in the latent space
$\mathcal{Z}$.

However, natural tectonic events may also occur. In addition, seismic stations
often record explosions in quarries in the region. Despite the cessation of
mining activities, mine-induced seismic events still occur. Therefore, a rapid
differentiation between tectonic and anthropogenic events is still important.
  The region is currently monitored by the OKC seismic station in
Ostrava-Kr\'{a}sn\'{e} Pole built in 1983 which is a part of the Czech Regional
Seismic Network. The station has been providing digital continuous waveform
data at 100 Hz since 2007. In the years 1992--2002, the region was co-monitored
by the Seismic Polygon Fren\v{s}t\'{a}t (SPF) which consisted of five seismic
stations using a triggered STA/LTA system.
  In this study, we apply and compare machine learning methods to the SPF
dataset, which contains labeled records of tectonic and mining-induced events.
For binary classification, a Long Short-Term Memory recurrent neural network
and XGBoost achieved an F1-score of 0.94 -- 0.95, demonstrating the potential
of modern machine learning techniques for rapid event characterization.

TL;DR: 论文提出了EPO框架，通过熵正则化、熵平滑正则器和自适应相位加权机制，解决多轮稀疏奖励环境中LLM智能体的探索-利用级联失败问题，在ScienceWorld和ALFWorld上分别实现了152%和19.8%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多轮稀疏奖励环境中训练LLM智能体存在探索-利用级联失败问题：早期策略过早收敛到低熵策略，后期传统熵正则化反而导致策略崩溃和训练不稳定。

Method: 提出EPO框架，包含三个协同机制：(1)多轮设置中的熵正则化增强探索；(2)熵平滑正则器限制策略熵在历史平均值范围内；(3)自适应相位加权平衡训练过程中的探索与利用。

Result: EPO在ScienceWorld上实现最高152%性能提升，在ALFWorld上实现19.8%性能提升，证明了在多轮稀疏奖励环境中需要与传统RL不同的熵控制方法。

Conclusion: 多轮稀疏奖励环境需要与传统强化学习根本不同的熵控制策略，EPO框架通过系统性的熵管理机制有效解决了探索-利用级联失败问题，对LLM智能体训练具有广泛意义。

Abstract: Training LLM agents in multi-turn environments with sparse rewards, where
completing a single task requires 30+ turns of interaction within an episode,
presents a fundamental challenge for reinforcement learning. We identify a
critical failure mode unique to this setting: the exploration-exploitation
cascade failure. This cascade begins with early-stage policy premature
convergence, where sparse feedback causes agents to commit to flawed,
low-entropy strategies. Subsequently, agents enter late-stage policy collapse,
where conventional entropy regularization becomes counterproductive, promoting
chaotic exploration that destabilizes training. We propose Entropy-regularized
Policy Optimization (EPO), a general framework that breaks this failure cycle
through three synergistic mechanisms: (1) adopting entropy regularization in
multi-turn settings to enhance exploration, (2) an entropy smoothing
regularizer that bounds policy entropy within historical averages to prevent
abrupt fluctuations, and (3) adaptive phase-based weighting that balances
exploration and exploitation across training. Our analysis justifies that EPO
guarantees monotonically decreasing entropy variance while maintaining
convergence. EPO achieves up to 152% performance improvement on ScienceWorld
and up to 19.8% on ALFWorld. Our work demonstrates that multi-turn
sparse-reward settings require fundamentally different entropy control than
traditional RL, with broad implications for LLM agent training.

TL;DR: 论文提出EDGE评估协议，通过识别极端类别序列来更准确地评估类增量学习的性能分布，解决传统采样方法低估方差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CIL评估使用少量随机序列计算均值和方差，无法捕捉完整性能分布范围，导致估计偏差和方差低估。

Method: 提出EDGE协议，利用任务间相似性与性能的正相关关系，自适应识别和采样极端类别序列，近似真实性能分布。

Result: 实验表明EDGE能有效捕捉性能极值，提供更准确的分布边界估计，为模型选择和鲁棒性检查提供可行见解。

Conclusion: EDGE通过极端序列评估提供了更可靠的CIL性能分布表征，改进了传统评估方法的局限性。

Abstract: Class Incremental Learning (CIL) requires models to continuously learn new
classes without forgetting previously learned ones, while maintaining stable
performance across all possible class sequences. In real-world settings, the
order in which classes arrive is diverse and unpredictable, and model
performance can vary substantially across different sequences. Yet mainstream
evaluation protocols calculate mean and variance from only a small set of
randomly sampled sequences. Our theoretical analysis and empirical results
demonstrate that this sampling strategy fails to capture the full performance
range, resulting in biased mean estimates and a severe underestimation of the
true variance in the performance distribution. We therefore contend that a
robust CIL evaluation protocol should accurately characterize and estimate the
entire performance distribution. To this end, we introduce the concept of
extreme sequences and provide theoretical justification for their crucial role
in the reliable evaluation of CIL. Moreover, we observe a consistent positive
correlation between inter-task similarity and model performance, a relation
that can be leveraged to guide the search for extreme sequences. Building on
these insights, we propose EDGE (Extreme case-based Distribution and
Generalization Evaluation), an evaluation protocol that adaptively identifies
and samples extreme class sequences using inter-task similarity, offering a
closer approximation of the ground-truth performance distribution. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that EDGE effectively captures performance extremes and
yields more accurate estimates of distributional boundaries, providing
actionable insights for model selection and robustness checking. Our code is

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合最优传输采样的Mean Flow方法，解决了现有单步生成模型在多步流匹配过程中保真度和多样性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流匹配生成模型虽然在各领域取得优异成果，但推理速度慢。Mean Flow方法虽然能实现单步生成加速，但在许多连续域中无法准确近似原始多步流匹配过程的行为。

Method: 将基于最优传输的采样策略整合到Mean Flow框架中，使单步生成器能更好地保持原始多步流过程的保真度和多样性。

Result: 在低维控制设置和高维任务（如图像生成、图像到图像转换、点云生成）上的实验表明，该方法在单步生成建模中实现了更优的推理精度。

Conclusion: 通过结合最优传输采样策略，提出的方法在保持单步生成速度优势的同时，显著提升了生成质量，为流匹配模型的实际应用提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Flow-matching generative models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
continuous data generation, achieving state-of-the-art results across domains
such as images, 3D shapes, and point clouds. Despite their success, these
models suffer from slow inference due to the requirement of numerous sequential
sampling steps. Recent work has sought to accelerate inference by reducing the
number of sampling steps. In particular, Mean Flows offer a one-step generation
approach that delivers substantial speedups while retaining strong generative
performance. Yet, in many continuous domains, Mean Flows fail to faithfully
approximate the behavior of the original multi-step flow-matching process. In
this work, we address this limitation by incorporating optimal transport-based
sampling strategies into the Mean Flow framework, enabling one-step generators
that better preserve the fidelity and diversity of the original multi-step flow
process. Experiments on controlled low-dimensional settings and on
high-dimensional tasks such as image generation, image-to-image translation,
and point cloud generation demonstrate that our approach achieves superior
inference accuracy in one-step generative modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出Quantile Advantage Estimation (QAE)方法，通过用分位数基线替代均值基线，解决了强化学习中熵崩溃和熵爆炸问题，实现了稳定的熵控制和持续的推理性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于无价值强化学习的方法（如GRPO和DAPO）使用均值基线，在奖励异常值情况下会不当惩罚负优势样本，导致训练在熵崩溃和熵爆炸之间振荡。

Method: 提出QAE方法，用分组K-分位数基线替代均值基线，在困难查询中强化罕见成功，在简单查询中针对剩余失败，并通过一阶softmax更新证明了两侧熵安全性。

Result: QAE稳定了熵动态，稀疏化了信用分配（约80%响应获得零优势），在Qwen3-8B/14B-Base模型上对AIME 2024/2025和AMC 2023任务实现了持续的pass@1提升。

Conclusion: 基线设计（而非token级启发式）是扩展可验证奖励强化学习的主要机制，QAE为RLVR提供了稳定且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) strengthens LLM
reasoning, but training often oscillates between {entropy collapse} and
{entropy explosion}. We trace both hazards to the mean baseline used in
value-free RL (e.g., GRPO and DAPO), which improperly penalizes
negative-advantage samples under reward outliers. We propose {Quantile
Advantage Estimation} (QAE), replacing the mean with a group-wise K-quantile
baseline. QAE induces a response-level, two-regime gate: on hard queries (p <=
1 - K) it reinforces rare successes, while on easy queries (p > 1 - K) it
targets remaining failures. Under first-order softmax updates, we prove
{two-sided entropy safety}, giving lower and upper bounds on one-step entropy
change that curb explosion and prevent collapse. Empirically, this minimal
modification stabilizes entropy, sparsifies credit assignment (with tuned K,
roughly 80% of responses receive zero advantage), and yields sustained pass@1
gains on Qwen3-8B/14B-Base across AIME 2024/2025 and AMC 2023. These results
identify {baseline design} -- rather than token-level heuristics -- as the
primary mechanism for scaling RLVR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICL在数据稀缺情况下比SFT具有更好的泛化性和校准响应，但推理计算成本更高。研究能否利用ICL的内部计算来改进SFT的质量。

Method: 提出ICL激活对齐(IA2)的自蒸馏技术，在SFT之前作为预备步骤，让SFT模型复制ICL的激活模式并激励ICL式的内部推理。

Result: 在12个流行基准测试和2个模型家族上的广泛实证结果显示，IA2显著提高了模型输出的准确性和校准性。

Conclusion: IA2不仅具有实际应用价值，还为理解模型适应的内部机制提供了概念窗口。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is used to specialize model behavior by training
weights to produce intended target responses for queries. In contrast,
In-Context Learning (ICL) adapts models during inference with instructions or
demonstrations in the prompt. ICL can offer better generalizability and more
calibrated responses compared to SFT in data scarce settings, at the cost of
more inference compute. In this work, we ask the question: Can ICL's internal
computations be used to improve the qualities of SFT? We first show that ICL
and SFT produce distinct activation patterns, indicating that the two methods
achieve adaptation through different functional mechanisms. Motivated by this
observation and to use ICL's rich functionality, we introduce ICL Activation
Alignment (IA2), a self-distillation technique which aims to replicate ICL's
activation patterns in SFT models and incentivizes ICL-like internal reasoning.
Performing IA2 as a priming step before SFT significantly improves the accuracy
and calibration of model outputs, as shown by our extensive empirical results
on 12 popular benchmarks and 2 model families. This finding is not only
practically useful, but also offers a conceptual window into the inner
mechanics of model adaptation.

Motivation: DFM是一种有前景的离散生成建模框架，通过训练神经网络来近似变换速度场来学习底层生成动态。需要从理论上分析其收敛性保证。

Method: 通过分解最终分布估计误差建立保证链：首先证明生成分布与目标分布之间的总变差距离由学习速度场的风险控制，然后通过分析近似误差和估计误差来界定这个风险。

Result: 提供了第一个正式证明：当训练集规模增加时，训练后的DFM模型生成分布会可证明地收敛到真实数据分布。

Conclusion: 该理论分析为DFM生成模型提供了坚实的收敛性保证，建立了从近似能力到统计收敛的完整理论框架。

Abstract: We provide a theoretical analysis for end-to-end training Discrete Flow
Matching (DFM) generative models. DFM is a promising discrete generative
modeling framework that learns the underlying generative dynamics by training a
neural network to approximate the transformative velocity field. Our analysis
establishes a clear chain of guarantees by decomposing the final distribution
estimation error. We first prove that the total variation distance between the
generated and target distributions is controlled by the risk of the learned
velocity field. We then bound this risk by analyzing its two primary sources:
(i) Approximation Error, where we quantify the capacity of the Transformer
architecture to represent the true velocity, and (ii) Estimation Error, where
we derive statistical convergence rates that bound the error from training on a
finite dataset. By composing these results, we provide the first formal proof
that the distribution generated by a trained DFM model provably converges to
the true data distribution as the training set size increases.

Motivation: 解决现有深度学习方法忽视启发式函数的可采纳性（admissibility）以及缺乏对训练数据外泛化保证的问题。

Method: 将启发式学习建模为约束优化问题，提出交叉熵可采纳性（CEA）损失函数来在训练中强制可采纳性；利用模式数据库抽象和图结构特性分析学习样本复杂度。

Result: 在魔方问题上，CEA方法产生了接近可采纳的启发式，其引导能力显著强于压缩模式数据库启发式；理论分析给出了A*算法泛化所需的训练样本数上界。

Conclusion: CEA方法能有效学习可采纳启发式，理论分析为基于神经网络的启发式学习提供了泛化保证，特别是首次给出了目标依赖启发式的泛化保证。

Abstract: Heuristic functions are central to the performance of search algorithms such
as A-star, where admissibility - the property of never overestimating the true
shortest-path cost - guarantees solution optimality. Recent deep learning
approaches often disregard admissibility and provide limited guarantees on
generalization beyond the training data. This paper addresses both of these
limitations. First, we pose heuristic learning as a constrained optimization
problem and introduce Cross-Entropy Admissibility (CEA), a loss function that
enforces admissibility during training. On the Rubik's Cube domain, this method
yields near-admissible heuristics with significantly stronger guidance than
compressed pattern database (PDB) heuristics. Theoretically, we study the
sample complexity of learning heuristics. By leveraging PDB abstractions and
the structural properties of graphs such as the Rubik's Cube, we tighten the
bound on the number of training samples needed for A-star to generalize.
Replacing a general hypothesis class with a ReLU neural network gives bounds
that depend primarily on the network's width and depth, rather than on graph
size. Using the same network, we also provide the first generalization
guarantees for goal-dependent heuristics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有白盒监控器在训练和评估时容易受到诱导信息泄漏的影响，导致性能评估失真，需要区分监控器检测的是真实模型行为还是诱导伪影。

Method: 使用内容过滤（移除欺骗相关文本）、分数过滤（仅聚合任务相关token）、提示蒸馏微调模型生物（无需显式提示即可展现欺骗行为）三种策略。

Result: 内容过滤可平滑移除诱导信号，使AUROC降低30%；分数过滤减少AUROC 15%；微调模型生物改善评估但使性能下降达40%，即使重新训练。

Conclusion: 监控器性能评估存在显著泄漏问题，需要系统性框架来区分真实行为检测与诱导伪影，提出的三种策略能有效缓解泄漏但会降低性能。

Abstract: White box monitors that analyze model internals offer promising advantages
for detecting potentially harmful behaviors in large language models, including
lower computational costs and integration into layered defense systems.However,
training and evaluating these monitors requires response exemplars that exhibit
the target behaviors, typically elicited through prompting or fine-tuning. This
presents a challenge when the information used to elicit behaviors inevitably
leaks into the data that monitors ingest, inflating their effectiveness. We
present a systematic framework for evaluating a monitor's performance in terms
of its ability to detect genuine model behavior rather than superficial
elicitation artifacts. Furthermore, we propose three novel strategies to
evaluate the monitor: content filtering (removing deception-related text from
inputs), score filtering (aggregating only over task-relevant tokens), and
prompt distilled fine-tuned model organisms (models trained to exhibit
deceptive behavior without explicit prompting). Using deception detection as a
representative case study, we identify two forms of leakage that inflate
monitor performance: elicitation leakage from prompts that explicitly request
harmful behavior, and reasoning leakage from models that verbalize their
deceptive actions. Through experiments on multiple deception benchmarks, we
apply our proposed mitigation strategies and measure performance retention. Our
evaluation of the monitors reveal three crucial findings: (1) Content filtering
is a good mitigation strategy that allows for a smooth removal of elicitation
signal and can decrease probe AUROC by 30\% (2) Score filtering was found to
reduce AUROC by 15\% but is not as straightforward to attribute to (3) A
finetuned model organism improves monitor evaluations but reduces their
performance by upto 40\%, even when re-trained.

Motivation: 解决大规模验证链式思维推理轨迹的问题，因为正确推理虽然风格多样但会收敛到相同的决策支点，而错误推理会违反至少一个支点。

Method: 提出自训练管道：采样多样推理路径并挖掘共享决策支点；使用辅助验证器将每个轨迹压缩为支点聚焦的短路径推理；使用自生成输出进行后训练。

Result: 在LogiQA、MedQA和MATH500等标准基准测试中证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在没有真实推理数据或外部指标的情况下有效对齐模型推理过程。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning exposes the intermediate thinking process of
large language models (LLMs), yet verifying those traces at scale remains
unsolved. In response, we introduce the idea of decision pivots-minimal,
verifiable checkpoints that any correct reasoning path must visit. We
hypothesize that correct reasoning, though stylistically diverse, converge on
the same pivot set, while incorrect ones violate at least one pivot. Leveraging
this property, we propose a self-training pipeline that (i) samples diverse
reasoning paths and mines shared decision pivots, (ii) compresses each trace
into pivot-focused short-path reasoning using an auxiliary verifier, and (iii)
post-trains the model using its self-generated outputs. The proposed method
aligns reasoning without ground truth reasoning data or external metrics.
Experiments on standard benchmarks such as LogiQA, MedQA, and MATH500 show the
effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Climate data science faces persistent barriers stemming from the fragmented
nature of data sources, heterogeneous formats, and the steep technical
expertise required to identify, acquire, and process datasets. These challenges
limit participation, slow discovery, and reduce the reproducibility of
scientific workflows. In this paper, we present a proof of concept for
addressing these barriers through the integration of a curated knowledge graph
(KG) with AI agents designed for cloud-native scientific workflows. The KG
provides a unifying layer that organizes datasets, tools, and workflows, while
AI agents -- powered by generative AI services -- enable natural language
interaction, automated data access, and streamlined analysis. Together, these
components drastically lower the technical threshold for engaging in climate
data science, enabling non-specialist users to identify and analyze relevant
datasets. By leveraging existing cloud-ready API data portals, we demonstrate
that "a knowledge graph is all you need" to unlock scalable and agentic
workflows for scientific inquiry. The open-source design of our system further
supports community contributions, ensuring that the KG and associated tools can
evolve as a shared commons. Our results illustrate a pathway toward
democratizing access to climate data and establishing a reproducible,
extensible framework for human--AI collaboration in scientific research.

Motivation: 预测消费者行为在营销、认知神经科学和人机交互中很重要，EEG数据可以提供大脑神经活动的详细信息来分析决策过程。

Method: 从NeuMa数据集提取和清理EEG特征，为GNN模型创建脑连接特征，使用多种传统机器学习模型（如集成模型）和不同架构的GNN模型进行比较。

Result: 结果整体上没有显著差异，但GNN模型在某些基本标准上表现更好，而传统模型在这些方面不够理想。

Conclusion: EEG信号分析与机器学习模型结合可以更深入理解消费者行为，并提供了传统模型（如SVM）与新兴模型（如GNN）在基于EEG的神经营销中的全面比较。

Abstract: Prediction of consumer behavior is one of the important purposes in
marketing, cognitive neuroscience, and human-computer interaction. The
electroencephalography (EEG) data can help analyze the decision process by
providing detailed information about the brain's neural activity. In this
research, a comparative approach is utilized for predicting consumer behavior
by EEG data. In the first step, the features of the EEG data from the NeuMa
dataset were extracted and cleaned. For the Graph Neural Network (GNN) models,
the brain connectivity features were created. Different machine learning
models, such as classical models and Graph Neural Networks, are used and
compared. The GNN models with different architectures are implemented to have a
comprehensive comparison; furthermore, a wide range of classical models, such
as ensemble models, are applied, which can be very helpful to show the
difference and performance of each model on the dataset. Although the results
did not show a significant difference overall, the GNN models generally
performed better in some basic criteria where classical models were not
satisfactory. This study not only shows that combining EEG signal analysis and
machine learning models can provide an approach to deeper understanding of
consumer behavior, but also provides a comprehensive comparison between the
machine learning models that have been widely used in previous studies in the
EEG-based neuromarketing such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), and the models
which are not used or rarely used in the field, like Graph Neural Networks.

Conclusion: GeoEvolve为自动化、知识驱动的地理空间建模提供了可扩展路径，为可信赖和高效的AI-for-Science发现开辟了新机会。

Abstract: Geospatial modeling provides critical solutions for pressing global
challenges such as sustainability and climate change. Existing large language
model (LLM)-based algorithm discovery frameworks, such as AlphaEvolve, excel at
evolving generic code but lack the domain knowledge and multi-step reasoning
required for complex geospatial problems. We introduce GeoEvolve, a multi-agent
LLM framework that couples evolutionary search with geospatial domain knowledge
to automatically design and refine geospatial algorithms. GeoEvolve operates in
two nested loops: an inner loop leverages a code evolver to generate and mutate
candidate solutions, while an outer agentic controller evaluates global elites
and queries a GeoKnowRAG module -- a structured geospatial knowledge base that
injects theoretical priors from geography. This knowledge-guided evolution
steers the search toward theoretically meaningful and computationally efficient
algorithms. We evaluate GeoEvolve on two fundamental and classical tasks:
spatial interpolation (kriging) and spatial uncertainty quantification
(geospatial conformal prediction). Across these benchmarks, GeoEvolve
automatically improves and discovers new algorithms, incorporating geospatial
theory on top of classical models. It reduces spatial interpolation error
(RMSE) by 13-21% and enhances uncertainty estimation performance by 17\%.
Ablation studies confirm that domain-guided retrieval is essential for stable,
high-quality evolution. These results demonstrate that GeoEvolve provides a
scalable path toward automated, knowledge-driven geospatial modeling, opening
new opportunities for trustworthy and efficient AI-for-Science discovery.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable survival analysis remains a core challenge in
oncology. With growing multimodal data and the clinical need for transparent
models to support validation and trust, this challenge increases in complexity.
We propose an interpretable multimodal AI framework to automate survival
analysis by integrating clinical variables and computed tomography imaging. Our
MultiFIX-based framework uses deep learning to infer survival-relevant features
that are further explained: imaging features are interpreted via Grad-CAM,
while clinical variables are modeled as symbolic expressions through genetic
programming. Risk estimation employs a transparent Cox regression, enabling
stratification into groups with distinct survival outcomes. Using the
open-source RADCURE dataset for head and neck cancer, MultiFIX achieves a
C-index of 0.838 (prediction) and 0.826 (stratification), outperforming the
clinical and academic baseline approaches and aligning with known prognostic
markers. These results highlight the promise of interpretable multimodal AI for

### [381] [Semantic F1 Scores: Fair Evaluation Under Fuzzy Class Boundaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21633)
*Georgios Chochlakis,Jackson Trager,Vedant Jhaveri,Nikhil Ravichandran,Alexandros Potamianos,Shrikanth Narayanan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出语义F1分数，一种用于主观或多标签分类的新评估指标，通过量化预测标签与真实标签之间的语义相关性来改进传统F1指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统F1指标将语义相关的预测视为完全失败，无法反映存在人类分歧或模糊类别边界的现实情况。需要一种能够给予语义相关但不完全相同标签部分信用的评估方法。

Method: 使用标签相似度矩阵计算软精确率和软召回率，通过新颖的两步精确率-召回率公式推导出语义F1分数，能够比较任意大小的标签集而不丢弃标签或强制匹配不相似标签。

Result: 通过理论论证和在合成及真实数据上的广泛实证验证，语义F1显示出更好的可解释性和生态效度。该方法对相似度矩阵的误设具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 语义F1分数提供了更公平的评估，能够识别类别重叠、标注者分歧以及基于相似预测会产生相似结果的情况，适用于各种任务和模态。

Abstract: We propose Semantic F1 Scores, novel evaluation metrics for subjective or
fuzzy multi-label classification that quantify semantic relatedness between
predicted and gold labels. Unlike the conventional F1 metrics that treat
semantically related predictions as complete failures, Semantic F1 incorporates
a label similarity matrix to compute soft precision-like and recall-like
scores, from which the Semantic F1 scores are derived. Unlike existing
similarity-based metrics, our novel two-step precision-recall formulation
enables the comparison of label sets of arbitrary sizes without discarding
labels or forcing matches between dissimilar labels. By granting partial credit
for semantically related but nonidentical labels, Semantic F1 better reflects
the realities of domains marked by human disagreement or fuzzy category
boundaries. In this way, it provides fairer evaluations: it recognizes that
categories overlap, that annotators disagree, and that downstream decisions
based on similar predictions lead to similar outcomes. Through theoretical
justification and extensive empirical validation on synthetic and real data, we
show that Semantic F1 demonstrates greater interpretability and ecological
validity. Because it requires only a domain-appropriate similarity matrix,
which is robust to misspecification, and not a rigid ontology, it is applicable
across tasks and modalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当AI与物理世界交互时（如机器人或辅助代理），会面临比纯数字AI更直接和即时的物理伤害风险。需要评估基础模型对物理安全常识的理解程度。

Method: 1. 基于真实伤害叙事和操作安全约束开发可扩展的物理安全基准测试；2. 使用生成式模型创建从安全到不安全状态的逼真图像和视频；3. 分析主流基础模型的风险感知、安全推理和干预触发能力；4. 开发后训练范式，通过系统指令教授模型具身特定的安全约束。

Conclusion: 该研究为具身AI系统的物理安全评估提供了系统性的基准测试方法，并通过后训练显著提升了模型的安全推理能力，增强了部署安全性。

Abstract: When AI interacts with the physical world -- as a robot or an assistive agent
-- new safety challenges emerge beyond those of purely ``digital AI". In such
interactions, the potential for physical harm is direct and immediate. How well
do state-of-the-art foundation models understand common-sense facts about
physical safety, e.g. that a box may be too heavy to lift, or that a hot cup of
coffee should not be handed to a child? In this paper, our contributions are
three-fold: first, we develop a highly scalable approach to continuous physical
safety benchmarking of Embodied AI systems, grounded in real-world injury
narratives and operational safety constraints. To probe multi-modal safety
understanding, we turn these narratives and constraints into photorealistic
images and videos capturing transitions from safe to unsafe states, using
advanced generative models. Secondly, we comprehensively analyze the ability of
major foundation models to perceive risks, reason about safety, and trigger
interventions; this yields multi-faceted insights into their deployment
readiness for safety-critical agentic applications. Finally, we develop a
post-training paradigm to teach models to explicitly reason about
embodiment-specific safety constraints provided through system instructions.
The resulting models generate thinking traces that make safety reasoning
interpretable and transparent, achieving state of the art performance in
constraint satisfaction evaluations. The benchmark will be released at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ASAL++在人工生命领域引入多模态基础模型驱动的开放式搜索方法，通过第二个基础模型基于模拟视觉历史提出新的进化目标，创建具有递增复杂度的进化轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型为人工生命模拟提供了强大的自动化搜索工具，之前的工作使用视觉语言模型将人工生命模拟与自然语言目标提示对齐。本研究旨在构建更开放式的搜索方法。

Method: 提出ASAL++方法，使用第二个基础模型基于模拟视觉历史提出新的进化目标。探索两种策略：EST（每次迭代匹配单个新提示）和ETT（匹配整个生成提示序列）。在Lenia基质中使用Gemma-3进行实证测试。

Result: 实证结果显示，EST促进了更大的视觉新颖性，而ETT培养了更连贯和可解释的进化序列。

Conclusion: ASAL++为基础模型驱动的人工生命发现指明了具有开放式特征的新方向。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have recently opened up new frontiers in the field of
artificial life (ALife) by providing powerful tools to automate search through
ALife simulations. Previous work aligns ALife simulations with natural language
target prompts using vision-language models (VLMs). We build on Automated
Search for Artificial Life (ASAL) by introducing ASAL++, a method for
open-ended-like search guided by multimodal FMs. We use a second FM to propose
new evolutionary targets based on a simulation's visual history. This induces
an evolutionary trajectory with increasingly complex targets.
  We explore two strategies: (1) evolving a simulation to match a single new
prompt at each iteration (Evolved Supervised Targets: EST) and (2) evolving a
simulation to match the entire sequence of generated prompts (Evolved Temporal
Targets: ETT). We test our method empirically in the Lenia substrate using
Gemma-3 to propose evolutionary targets, and show that EST promotes greater
visual novelty, while ETT fosters more coherent and interpretable evolutionary
sequences.
  Our results suggest that ASAL++ points towards new directions for FM-driven
ALife discovery with open-ended characteristics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于GRPO的框架，利用ASR模型和有限配对数据，为低资源语言开发高质量的文本转语音系统


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言缺乏成对的文本和语音数据，而自动语音识别模型相对更容易获得，需要解决低资源语言的TTS开发难题

Method: 首先用IPA标记训练多语言基础模型，然后用有限配对数据微调，最后使用GRPO优化，结合ASR、说话人验证和音频质量评估的多目标奖励

Result: 在低资源语言中产生清晰且说话人一致的语音，显著优于仅微调的方法，在高资源语言中也优于DPO等对齐方法

Conclusion: GRPO框架能有效利用ASR模型和有限数据，为低资源语言开发高质量的TTS系统，并在高资源语言中也有优势

Abstract: Developing high-quality text-to-speech (TTS) systems for low-resource
languages is challenging due to the scarcity of paired text and speech data. In
contrast, automatic speech recognition (ASR) models for such languages are
often more accessible, owing to large-scale multilingual pre-training efforts.
We propose a framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to
adapt an autoregressive, multilingual TTS model to new languages. Our method
first establishes a language-agnostic foundation for TTS synthesis by training
a multilingual baseline with International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) tokens.
Next, we fine-tune this model on limited paired data of the new languages to
capture the target language's prosodic features. Finally, we apply GRPO to
optimize the model using only unpaired text and speaker prompts, guided by a
multi-objective reward from pretrained ASR, speaker verification, and audio
quality estimation models. Experiments demonstrate that this pipeline produces
intelligible and speaker-consistent speech in low-resource languages,
substantially outperforming fine-tuning alone. Furthermore, our GRPO-based
framework also improves TTS performance in high-resource languages, surpassing
offline alignment methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) yielding
superior intelligibility, speaker similarity, and audio quality.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于公理的决策建模框架，揭示了决策与评估之间的内在矛盾（决策-评估悖论），并警告在训练决策模型和应用公理时需要格外谨慎。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究决策公理（如伦理约束）在建模决策时的作用，探索公理在制定决策和评估决策之间的潜在冲突。

Method: 引入基于公理的决策建模框架，根据公理的结构特性定义分类法，分析决策-评估悖论的产生机制。

Result: 发现决策-评估悖论在现实的公理结构中普遍存在，揭示了使用决策数据训练模型和应用公理进行决策评估时的内在矛盾。

Conclusion: 在训练决策模型和应用决策公理时需要特别谨慎，因为决策-评估悖论表明决策制定和决策评估之间存在根本性冲突。

Abstract: We introduce a framework for modeling decisions with axioms that are
statements about decisions, e.g., ethical constraints. Using our framework we
define a taxonomy of decision axioms based on their structural properties and
demonstrate a tension between the use of axioms to make decisions and the use
of axioms to evaluate decisions which we call the Decision-Evaluation Paradox.
We argue that the Decision-Evaluation Paradox arises with realistic axiom
structures, and the paradox illuminates why one must be exceptionally careful
when training models on decision data or applying axioms to make and evaluate
decisions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RoT（Retrieval-of-Thought）通过检索和重用先前的推理步骤作为可组合的"思想"来指导新问题，显著减少推理延迟和成本，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型通过生成长推理轨迹来提高准确性，但这会增加延迟和成本，因此需要推理时效率优化。

Method: RoT将推理步骤组织成具有顺序和语义边的思想图，通过检索查询相关节点和应用奖励引导遍历来组装问题特定的模板，动态重用模板减少冗余探索。

Result: RoT在多个模型和推理基准上的评估显示，输出token减少高达40%，推理延迟降低82%，成本降低59%，同时保持准确性。

Conclusion: RoT通过检索动态构建模板，为高效LRM推理建立了可扩展的范式。

Abstract: Large reasoning models improve accuracy by producing long reasoning traces,
but this inflates latency and cost, motivating inference-time efficiency. We
propose Retrieval-of-Thought (RoT), which reuses prior reasoning as composable
``thought" steps to guide new problems. RoT organizes steps into a thought
graph with sequential and semantic edges to enable fast retrieval and flexible
recombination. At inference, RoT retrieves query-relevant nodes and applies
reward-guided traversal to assemble a problem-specific template that guides
generation. This dynamic template reuse reduces redundant exploration and,
therefore, reduces output tokens while preserving accuracy. We evaluate RoT on
reasoning benchmarks with multiple models, measuring accuracy, token usage,
latency, and memory overhead. Findings show small prompt growth but substantial
efficiency gains, with RoT reducing output tokens by up to 40%, inference
latency by 82%, and cost by 59% while maintaining accuracy. RoT establishes a
scalable paradigm for efficient LRM reasoning via dynamic template construction
through retrieval.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型驱动的多智能体系统研究缺乏受控实验的原则性方法，限制了涌现行为研究的进展。

Method: 开发Shachi框架，将智能体策略分解为配置（内在特质）、记忆（上下文持久性）和工具（扩展能力）三个组件，由LLM推理引擎协调。

Result: 在10个任务的基准测试中验证了方法的有效性，通过模拟美国关税冲击实验证明，只有当智能体认知架构正确配置记忆和工具时，其行为才能与真实市场反应一致。

Conclusion: 该工作为构建和评估LLM智能体提供了严谨的开源基础，旨在促进更具累积性和科学依据的研究。

Abstract: The study of emergent behaviors in large language model (LLM)-driven
multi-agent systems is a critical research challenge, yet progress is limited
by a lack of principled methodologies for controlled experimentation. To
address this, we introduce Shachi, a formal methodology and modular framework
that decomposes an agent's policy into core cognitive components: Configuration
for intrinsic traits, Memory for contextual persistence, and Tools for expanded
capabilities, all orchestrated by an LLM reasoning engine. This principled
architecture moves beyond brittle, ad-hoc agent designs and enables the
systematic analysis of how specific architectural choices influence collective
behavior. We validate our methodology on a comprehensive 10-task benchmark and
demonstrate its power through novel scientific inquiries. Critically, we
establish the external validity of our approach by modeling a real-world U.S.
tariff shock, showing that agent behaviors align with observed market reactions
only when their cognitive architecture is appropriately configured with memory
and tools. Our work provides a rigorous, open-source foundation for building
and evaluating LLM agents, aimed at fostering more cumulative and
scientifically grounded research.

TL;DR: 提出LLR-BC框架，解决神经VRP求解器在终身学习场景中的灾难性遗忘问题，通过行为整合保持先前任务知识，同时学习新任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经求解器在遇到新任务时，要么依赖零样本泛化（效果差），要么微调（导致灾难性遗忘），需要一种终身学习方法来同时解决新任务并保持先前任务性能。

Method: 提出LLR-BC框架，通过决策导向的行为整合方法，将新任务训练的求解器行为与缓冲行为对齐，并为低置信度决策分配更大权重以关注关键经验。

Result: 在容量约束车辆路径问题和旅行商问题上的实验表明，LLR-BC能有效训练高性能神经求解器，解决灾难性遗忘，保持可塑性并提升零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: LLR-BC为神经VRP求解器提供了一种有效的终身学习解决方案，能够在新任务不断出现的情况下持续学习和保持性能。

Abstract: Recent neural solvers have demonstrated promising performance in learning to
solve routing problems. However, existing studies are primarily based on
one-off training on one or a set of predefined problem distributions and
scales, i.e., tasks. When a new task arises, they typically rely on either
zero-shot generalization, which may be poor due to the discrepancies between
the new task and the training task(s), or fine-tuning the pretrained solver on
the new task, which possibly leads to catastrophic forgetting of knowledge
acquired from previous tasks. This paper explores a novel lifelong learning
paradigm for neural VRP solvers, where multiple tasks with diverse
distributions and scales arise sequentially over time. Solvers are required to
effectively and efficiently learn to solve new tasks while maintaining their
performance on previously learned tasks. Consequently, a novel framework called
Lifelong Learning Router with Behavior Consolidation (LLR-BC) is proposed.
LLR-BC consolidates prior knowledge effectively by aligning behaviors of the
solver trained on a new task with the buffered ones in a decision-seeking way.
To encourage more focus on crucial experiences, LLR-BC assigns greater
consolidated weights to decisions with lower confidence. Extensive experiments
on capacitated vehicle routing problems and traveling salesman problems
demonstrate LLR-BC's effectiveness in training high-performance neural solvers
in a lifelong learning setting, addressing the catastrophic forgetting issue,
maintaining their plasticity, and improving zero-shot generalization ability.

TL;DR: CoBel-World是一个为LLM智能体设计的协作信念世界框架，通过建模物理环境和协作伙伴心理状态，实现动态意图推理和自适应通信，显著提升多智能体协作效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM协作框架忽视了动态意图推理能力，导致计划不一致和通信冗余，降低协作效率。需要让智能体能够推理协作伙伴的意图以避免协调失误。

Method: 提出CoBel-World框架，使用符号信念语言将开放世界任务知识解析为结构化信念，通过LLM推理进行零样本贝叶斯式信念更新，主动检测潜在协调冲突并自适应通信。

Result: 在TDW-MAT和C-WAH基准测试中，CoBel-World相比最强基线减少22-60%通信成本，提高4-28%任务完成效率。

Conclusion: 显式的、意图感知的信念建模对于基于LLM的多智能体系统中实现高效、类人协作至关重要。

Abstract: Effective real-world multi-agent collaboration requires not only accurate
planning but also the ability to reason about collaborators' intents -- a
crucial capability for avoiding miscoordination and redundant communication
under partial observable environments. Due to their strong planning and
reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising
autonomous agents for collaborative task solving. However, existing
collaboration frameworks for LLMs overlook their reasoning potential for
dynamic intent inference, and thus produce inconsistent plans and redundant
communication, reducing collaboration efficiency. To bridge this gap, we
propose CoBel-World, a novel framework that equips LLM agents with a
collaborative belief world -- an internal representation jointly modeling the
physical environment and collaborators' mental states. CoBel-World enables
agents to parse open-world task knowledge into structured beliefs via a
symbolic belief language, and perform zero-shot Bayesian-style belief updates
through LLM reasoning. This allows agents to proactively detect potential
miscoordination (e.g., conflicting plans) and communicate adaptively. Evaluated
on challenging embodied benchmarks (i.e., TDW-MAT and C-WAH), CoBel-World
significantly reduces communication costs by 22-60% and improves task
completion efficiency by 4-28% compared to the strongest baseline. Our results
show that explicit, intent-aware belief modeling is essential for efficient and
human-like collaboration in LLM-based multi-agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注短视野、完全可观测任务，而现实世界中的关键任务（如软件开发、商业投资、科学发现）通常涉及长视野和部分可观测场景，需要系统性的评估方法。

Method: 通过探索任务在三个不同环境中验证核心能力，智能体需要在长视野发现任务中通过持续推理、规划、记忆和工具管理来迭代发现隐藏规则。

Result: 在最重规模设置下，轨迹平均超过20万token和400次工具调用；标准配置下也超过3.5万token和60次工具调用。实验显示LLM智能体表现不佳，而人类参与者得分更高。

Conclusion: 智能体在长视野任务中存在显著能力差距，简单扩展方法无效，主要失败原因包括上下文锁定和功能性基础能力差距。

Abstract: Autonomous agents have recently achieved remarkable progress across diverse
domains, yet most evaluations focus on short-horizon, fully observable tasks.
In contrast, many critical real-world tasks, such as large-scale software
development, commercial investment, and scientific discovery, unfold in
long-horizon and partially observable scenarios where success hinges on
sustained reasoning, planning, memory management, and tool use. Existing
benchmarks rarely capture these long-horizon challenges, leaving a gap in
systematic evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{UltraHorizon} a
novel benchmark that measures the foundational capabilities essential for
complex real-world challenges. We use exploration as a unifying task across
three distinct environments to validate these core competencies. Agents are
designed in long-horizon discovery tasks where they must iteratively uncover
hidden rules through sustained reasoning, planning, memory and tools
management, and interaction with environments. Under the heaviest scale
setting, trajectories average \textbf{200k+} tokens and \textbf{400+} tool
calls, whereas in standard configurations they still exceed \textbf{35k} tokens
and involve more than \textbf{60} tool calls on average. Our extensive
experiments reveal that LLM-agents consistently underperform in these settings,
whereas human participants achieve higher scores, underscoring a persistent gap
in agents' long-horizon abilities. We also observe that simple scaling fails in
our task. To better illustrate the failure of agents, we conduct an in-depth
analysis of collected trajectories. We identify eight types of errors and
attribute them to two primary causes: in-context locking and functional
fundamental capability gaps.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Log2Plan是一个结合结构化两级规划框架和用户行为日志任务挖掘的GUI任务自动化系统，解决了现有LLM/VLM代理的脆弱泛化、高延迟和有限长程一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM或VLM的规划-执行代理存在脆弱泛化、高延迟和有限长程一致性问题，依赖单次推理或静态计划使其在UI变化或复杂任务下表现脆弱。

Method: 采用结构化两级规划框架：高层规划将用户命令映射到结构化任务字典，低层规划通过解释实时GUI上下文将高层计划具体化为动作序列，并结合用户行为日志的任务挖掘方法识别用户特定模式。

Result: 在200个真实世界任务上的评估显示，任务成功率和执行时间显著改善，在长程任务序列上保持超过60.0%的成功率。

Conclusion: Log2Plan通过结合结构化规划和任务挖掘，实现了稳健且适应性强的GUI自动化，在复杂多步骤工作流中表现出色。

Abstract: GUI task automation streamlines repetitive tasks, but existing LLM or
VLM-based planner-executor agents suffer from brittle generalization, high
latency, and limited long-horizon coherence. Their reliance on single-shot
reasoning or static plans makes them fragile under UI changes or complex tasks.
Log2Plan addresses these limitations by combining a structured two-level
planning framework with a task mining approach over user behavior logs,
enabling robust and adaptable GUI automation. Log2Plan constructs high-level
plans by mapping user commands to a structured task dictionary, enabling
consistent and generalizable automation. To support personalization and reuse,
it employs a task mining approach from user behavior logs that identifies
user-specific patterns. These high-level plans are then grounded into low-level
action sequences by interpreting real-time GUI context, ensuring robust
execution across varying interfaces. We evaluated Log2Plan on 200 real-world
tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in task success rate and
execution time. Notably, it maintains over 60.0% success rate even on
long-horizon task sequences, highlighting its robustness in complex, multi-step
workflows.

Motivation: 现有基准主要关注视觉感知或UI代码生成，对构建端到端网页应用所需的推理、鲁棒性和安全性能力评估不足，需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 从729个网站构建包含3799个问答对的基准，涵盖位置关系推理、颜色鲁棒性、安全关键检测等8个任务，采用标准化提示、确定性评估脚本和结合自动检查与人工验证的多阶段质量控制。

Result: 评估12个MLLMs显示模型在真实布局的组合推理、面对界面扰动时的鲁棒性以及识别安全关键操作方面存在显著差距，模型表现保守且能力有限。

Conclusion: WebRSSBench揭示了当前MLLMs在网页理解能力上的重要不足，为未来模型开发提供了关键的评估标准和改进方向。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly positioned as AI
collaborators for building complex web-related applications like GUI agents and
front-end code generation. However, existing benchmarks largely emphasize
visual perception or UI code generation, showing insufficient evaluation on the
reasoning, robustness and safety capability required for end-to-end web
applications. To bridge the gap, we introduce a comprehensive web understanding
benchmark, named WebRSSBench, that jointly evaluates Reasoning, Robustness, and
Safety across eight tasks, such as position relationship reasoning, color
robustness, and safety critical detection, etc. The benchmark is constructed
from 729 websites and contains 3799 question answer pairs that probe multi-step
inference over page structure, text, widgets, and safety-critical interactions.
To ensure reliable measurement, we adopt standardized prompts, deterministic
evaluation scripts, and multi-stage quality control combining automatic checks
with targeted human verification. We evaluate 12 MLLMs on WebRSSBench. The
results reveal significant gaps, models still struggle with compositional and
cross-element reasoning over realistic layouts, show limited robustness when
facing perturbations in user interfaces and content such as layout
rearrangements or visual style shifts, and are rather conservative in
recognizing and avoiding safety critical or irreversible actions. Our code is

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前GUI代理面临的三大挑战：端到端训练的数据瓶颈、延迟错误检测的高成本以及矛盾指导的风险。

Method: 采用思考-对齐-反思的认知循环框架，包括应用特定提示检索、预执行对齐（思想-行动一致性检查和行动校正代理）、执行后状态反思代理。

Result: 在两个主要基准测试中创下新SOTA：AndroidWorld上75.8%的成功率，ScreenSpot-V2上96.8%的成功率。消融研究证明各组件均有显著贡献。

Conclusion: D-Artemis框架有效提升了通用多模态大语言模型在GUI任务中的能力，展现了强大的泛化性能，无需复杂轨迹数据集训练。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents aim to automate a wide spectrum of
human tasks by emulating user interaction. Despite rapid advancements, current
approaches are hindered by several critical challenges: data bottleneck in
end-to-end training, high cost of delayed error detection, and risk of
contradictory guidance. Inspired by the human cognitive loop of Thinking,
Alignment, and Reflection, we present D-Artemis -- a novel deliberative
framework in this paper. D-Artemis leverages a fine-grained, app-specific tip
retrieval mechanism to inform its decision-making process. It also employs a
proactive Pre-execution Alignment stage, where Thought-Action Consistency (TAC)
Check module and Action Correction Agent (ACA) work in concert to mitigate the
risk of execution failures. A post-execution Status Reflection Agent (SRA)
completes the cognitive loop, enabling strategic learning from experience.
Crucially, D-Artemis enhances the capabilities of general-purpose Multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) for GUI tasks without the need for training on
complex trajectory datasets, demonstrating strong generalization. D-Artemis
establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across both major benchmarks,
achieving a 75.8% success rate on AndroidWorld and 96.8% on ScreenSpot-V2.
Extensive ablation studies further demonstrate the significant contribution of
each component to the framework.

Motivation: 现有基于规则或模型的奖励方法难以泛化到GUI智能体，因为缺乏真实轨迹或应用数据库，而基于静态轨迹的LLM-as-a-Judge方法准确率有限。

Method: 使用通用推理器调度有针对性的状态探测任务，领域特定评估器执行这些任务，通过主动与环境交互收集额外观察，使推理器能够分配更准确的奖励。

Result: 在超过3000条轨迹上的实验表明，ProRe将奖励准确率和F1分数分别提高了5.3%和19.4%，与最先进策略智能体集成后成功率提高了22.4%。

Conclusion: ProRe通过主动环境交互显著提升了GUI智能体奖励评估的准确性和有效性。

Abstract: Reward is critical to the evaluation and training of large language models
(LLMs). However, existing rule-based or model-based reward methods struggle to
generalize to GUI agents, where access to ground-truth trajectories or
application databases is often unavailable, and static trajectory-based
LLM-as-a-Judge approaches suffer from limited accuracy. To address these
challenges, we propose ProRe, a proactive reward system that leverages a
general-purpose reasoner and domain-specific evaluator agents (actors). The
reasoner schedules targeted state probing tasks, which the evaluator agents
then execute by actively interacting with the environment to collect additional
observations. This enables the reasoner to assign more accurate and verifiable
rewards to GUI agents. Empirical results on over 3K trajectories demonstrate
that ProRe improves reward accuracy and F1 score by up to 5.3% and 19.4%,
respectively. Furthermore, integrating ProRe with state-of-the-art policy
agents yields a success rate improvement of up to 22.4%.

*Jaehyun Nam,Jinsung Yoon,Jiefeng Chen,Jinwoo Shin,Tomas Pfister*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DS-STAR是一个创新的数据科学智能体，通过自动数据文件分析、LLM验证步骤和顺序规划机制，解决了LLM在处理异构数据格式和生成分析计划方面的挑战，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据科学任务复杂且涉及多数据源探索，但现有LLM在处理异构数据格式和验证分析计划充分性方面存在困难，需要更可靠的数据科学自动化解决方案。

Method: DS-STAR包含三个核心组件：数据文件分析模块（自动探索和提取多种数据格式上下文）、验证步骤（LLM评估分析计划充分性）、顺序规划机制（从简单可执行计划开始迭代优化）。

Result: 在DABStep、KramaBench和DA-Code三个基准测试中取得最先进性能，特别是在需要处理多文件异构格式的困难任务上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DS-STAR通过其迭代优化和验证机制，能够可靠地处理涉及多样化数据源的复杂分析任务，为数据科学自动化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Data science, which transforms raw data into actionable insights, is critical
for data-driven decision-making. However, these tasks are often complex,
involving steps for exploring multiple data sources and synthesizing findings
to deliver insightful answers. While large language models (LLMs) show
significant promise in automating this process, they often struggle with
heterogeneous data formats and generate sub-optimal analysis plans, as
verifying plan sufficiency is inherently difficult without ground-truth labels
for such open-ended tasks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DS-STAR,
a novel data science agent. Specifically, DS-STAR makes three key
contributions: (1) a data file analysis module that automatically explores and
extracts context from diverse data formats, including unstructured types; (2) a
verification step where an LLM-based judge evaluates the sufficiency of the
analysis plan at each stage; and (3) a sequential planning mechanism that
starts with a simple, executable plan and iteratively refines it based on the
DS-STAR's feedback until its sufficiency is verified. This iterative refinement
allows DS-STAR to reliably navigate complex analyses involving diverse data
sources. Our experiments show that DS-STAR achieves state-of-the-art
performance across three challenging benchmarks: DABStep, KramaBench, and
DA-Code. Moreover, DS-STAR particularly outperforms baselines on hard tasks
that require processing multiple data files with heterogeneous formats.

Abstract: Travel planning (TP) agent has recently worked as an emerging building block
to interact with external tools and resources for travel itinerary generation,
ensuring enjoyable user experience. Despite its benefits, existing studies rely
on hand craft prompt and fixed agent workflow, hindering more flexible and
autonomous TP agent. This paper proposes DeepTravel, an end to end agentic
reinforcement learning framework for building autonomous travel planning agent,
capable of autonomously planning, executing tools, and reflecting on tool
responses to explore, verify, and refine intermediate actions in multi step
reasoning. To achieve this, we first construct a robust sandbox environment by
caching transportation, accommodation and POI data, facilitating TP agent
training without being constrained by real world APIs limitations (e.g.,
inconsistent outputs). Moreover, we develop a hierarchical reward modeling
system, where a trajectory level verifier first checks spatiotemporal
feasibility and filters unsatisfied travel itinerary, and then the turn level
verifier further validate itinerary detail consistency with tool responses,
enabling efficient and precise reward service. Finally, we propose the reply
augmented reinforcement learning method that enables TP agent to periodically
replay from a failures experience buffer, emerging notable agentic capacity. We
deploy trained TP agent on DiDi Enterprise Solutions App and conduct
comprehensive online and offline evaluations, demonstrating that DeepTravel
enables small size LLMs (e.g., Qwen3 32B) to significantly outperform existing
frontier LLMs such as OpenAI o1, o3 and DeepSeek R1 in travel planning tasks.

TL;DR: TRACE是一种新的图表示学习范式，通过层次化Transformer架构和函数偏移学习目标，解决了传统图神经网络在计算图建模中的架构不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统消息传递神经网络和Transformer在图计算任务中存在架构不匹配，无法捕捉计算的位置感知和层次化特性，限制了模型对计算图功能行为的建模能力。

Method: 使用层次化Transformer镜像计算流程，替代有缺陷的置换不变聚合；引入函数偏移学习目标，通过预测真实全局函数与简单局部近似之间的差异来解耦学习问题。

Result: 在电子电路等复杂计算图上，TRACE在全面基准测试中显著优于所有现有架构。

Conclusion: 架构对齐的主干网络和解耦学习目标构成了更鲁棒的学习计算范式，为解决图计算的基本挑战提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Learning to compute, the ability to model the functional behavior of a
computational graph, is a fundamental challenge for graph representation
learning. Yet, the dominant paradigm is architecturally mismatched for this
task. This flawed assumption, central to mainstream message passing neural
networks (MPNNs) and their conventional Transformer-based counterparts,
prevents models from capturing the position-aware, hierarchical nature of
computation. To resolve this, we introduce \textbf{TRACE}, a new paradigm built
on an architecturally sound backbone and a principled learning objective.
First, TRACE employs a Hierarchical Transformer that mirrors the step-by-step
flow of computation, providing a faithful architectural backbone that replaces
the flawed permutation-invariant aggregation. Second, we introduce
\textbf{function shift learning}, a novel objective that decouples the learning
problem. Instead of predicting the complex global function directly, our model
is trained to predict only the \textit{function shift}, the discrepancy between
the true global function and a simple local approximation that assumes input
independence. We validate this paradigm on electronic circuits, one of the most
complex and economically critical classes of computational graphs. Across a
comprehensive suite of benchmarks, TRACE substantially outperforms all prior
architectures. These results demonstrate that our architecturally-aligned
backbone and decoupled learning objective form a more robust paradigm for the
fundamental challenge of learning to compute on graphs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态作业车间调度面临新作业到达带来的频繁干扰，现有离线学习策略存在缺陷，而在线规划由于问题信息不完整容易受到扰动影响。

Method: 提出动态鲁棒MCTS方法，在MCTS中集成动作鲁棒性估计，引导生产环境转向既产生良好调度结果又易于适应未来作业到达的状态。

Result: 实验表明DyRo-MCTS显著提升离线学习策略性能，在线规划时间增加可忽略，在各种调度场景下持续优于标准MCTS。

Conclusion: DyRo-MCTS通过做出鲁棒调度决策，在扰动环境下实现长期可持续的性能提升。

Abstract: Dynamic job shop scheduling, a fundamental combinatorial optimisation problem
in various industrial sectors, poses substantial challenges for effective
scheduling due to frequent disruptions caused by the arrival of new jobs.
State-of-the-art methods employ machine learning to learn scheduling policies
offline, enabling rapid responses to dynamic events. However, these offline
policies are often imperfect, necessitating the use of planning techniques such
as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to improve performance at online decision
time. The unpredictability of new job arrivals complicates online planning, as
decisions based on incomplete problem information are vulnerable to
disturbances. To address this issue, we propose the Dynamic Robust MCTS
(DyRo-MCTS) approach, which integrates action robustness estimation into MCTS.
DyRo-MCTS guides the production environment toward states that not only yield
good scheduling outcomes but are also easily adaptable to future job arrivals.
Extensive experiments show that DyRo-MCTS significantly improves the
performance of offline-learned policies with negligible additional online
planning time. Moreover, DyRo-MCTS consistently outperforms vanilla MCTS across
various scheduling scenarios. Further analysis reveals that its ability to make
robust scheduling decisions leads to long-term, sustainable performance gains
under disturbances.

TL;DR: 本研究比较了统计参数映射(SPM)和可解释机器学习方法在足底压力数据异常检测中的表现，发现机器学习模型在准确性上优于SPM，且两种方法都能提供清晰有用的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 足底压力映射在临床诊断和运动科学中很重要，但大型异构数据集常包含技术错误或程序不一致导致的异常值。SPM提供可解释分析但对对齐敏感，其稳健异常检测能力尚不清楚。

Method: 使用来自多个中心的数据，通过专家共识标注并添加合成异常，共798个有效样本和2000个异常值。评估了(i)非参数、依赖配准的SPM方法和(ii)使用SHAP解释的卷积神经网络(CNN)。通过嵌套交叉验证评估性能，通过语义差异调查评估解释质量。

Result: 机器学习模型达到高准确率并优于SPM，SPM误分类了临床有意义的变异并遗漏了真实异常。专家认为SPM和SHAP解释都清晰、有用且可信，但SPM被认为复杂度较低。

Conclusion: SPM和可解释机器学习在足底压力数据自动异常检测中具有互补潜力，可解释性在将复杂模型输出转化为可解释见解以有效支持决策方面至关重要。

Abstract: Plantar pressure mapping is essential in clinical diagnostics and sports
science, yet large heterogeneous datasets often contain outliers from technical
errors or procedural inconsistencies. Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM)
provides interpretable analyses but is sensitive to alignment and its capacity
for robust outlier detection remains unclear. This study compares an SPM
approach with an explainable machine learning (ML) approach to establish
transparent quality-control pipelines for plantar pressure datasets. Data from
multiple centers were annotated by expert consensus and enriched with synthetic
anomalies resulting in 798 valid samples and 2000 outliers. We evaluated (i) a
non-parametric, registration-dependent SPM approach and (ii) a convolutional
neural network (CNN), explained using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP).
Performance was assessed via nested cross-validation; explanation quality via a
semantic differential survey with domain experts. The ML model reached high
accuracy and outperformed SPM, which misclassified clinically meaningful
variations and missed true outliers. Experts perceived both SPM and SHAP
explanations as clear, useful, and trustworthy, though SPM was assessed less
complex. These findings highlight the complementary potential of SPM and
explainable ML as approaches for automated outlier detection in plantar
pressure data, and underscore the importance of explainability in translating
complex model outputs into interpretable insights that can effectively inform
decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统爬虫方法和现有GUI代理无法处理电商风险管理所需的多样化、深度嵌入的网页数据和多步骤状态交互，这些代理通常限于单步任务且缺乏管理动态交互内容的能力。

Method: RISK框架包含三个组件：RISK-Data数据集（8,492单步和2,386多步交互轨迹）、RISK-Bench基准测试（802单步和320多步轨迹）、RISK-R1强化微调框架（考虑输出格式、单步级别、多步级别和任务级别四个方面的奖励机制）。

Conclusion: RISK为自动化复杂网页交互提供了可扩展的领域特定解决方案，推动了电商风险管理的技术进步。

Abstract: E-commerce risk management requires aggregating diverse, deeply embedded web
data through multi-step, stateful interactions, which traditional scraping
methods and most existing Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents cannot handle.
These agents are typically limited to single-step tasks and lack the ability to
manage dynamic, interactive content critical for effective risk assessment. To
address this challenge, we introduce RISK, a novel framework designed to build
and deploy GUI agents for this domain. RISK integrates three components: (1)
RISK-Data, a dataset of 8,492 single-step and 2,386 multi-step interaction
trajectories, collected through a high-fidelity browser framework and a
meticulous data curation process; (2) RISK-Bench, a benchmark with 802
single-step and 320 multi-step trajectories across three difficulty levels for
standardized evaluation; and (3) RISK-R1, a R1-style reinforcement fine-tuning
framework considering four aspects: (i) Output Format: Updated format reward to
enhance output syntactic correctness and task comprehension, (ii) Single-step
Level: Stepwise accuracy reward to provide granular feedback during early
training stages, (iii) Multi-step Level: Process reweight to emphasize critical
later steps in interaction sequences, and (iv) Task Level: Level reweight to
focus on tasks of varying difficulty. Experiments show that RISK-R1 outperforms
existing baselines, achieving a 6.8% improvement in offline single-step and an
8.8% improvement in offline multi-step. Moreover, it attains a top task success
rate of 70.5% in online evaluation. RISK provides a scalable, domain-specific
solution for automating complex web interactions, advancing the state of the
art in e-commerce risk management.

Conclusion: InfiAgent框架能够演变成通用的金字塔状多智能体系统，解决广泛的问题，显著提高了LLM智能体的执行效率和适应性。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in organizing and executing complex tasks, and many such agents are now widely
used in various application scenarios. However, developing these agents
requires carefully designed workflows, carefully crafted prompts, and iterative
tuning, which requires LLM techniques and domain-specific expertise. These
hand-crafted limitations hinder the scalability and cost-effectiveness of LLM
agents across a wide range of industries. To address these challenges, we
propose \textbf{InfiAgent}, a Pyramid-like DAG-based Multi-Agent Framework that
can be applied to \textbf{infi}nite scenarios, which introduces several key
innovations: a generalized "agent-as-a-tool" mechanism that automatically
decomposes complex agents into hierarchical multi-agent systems; a dual-audit
mechanism that ensures the quality and stability of task completion; an agent
routing function that enables efficient task-agent matching; and an agent
self-evolution mechanism that autonomously restructures the agent DAG based on
new tasks, poor performance, or optimization opportunities. Furthermore,
InfiAgent's atomic task design supports agent parallelism, significantly
improving execution efficiency. This framework evolves into a versatile
pyramid-like multi-agent system capable of solving a wide range of problems.
Evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that InfiAgent achieves 9.9\%
higher performance compared to ADAS (similar auto-generated agent framework),
while a case study of the AI research assistant InfiHelper shows that it
generates scientific papers that have received recognition from human reviewers
at top-tier IEEE conferences.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究反转诅咒的根本原因，探索语言模型内部知识表示的结构特性，以及这种结构如何影响模型编辑的一致性。

Method: 从零开始在合成关系知识图谱数据集上训练语言模型，分析其隐藏表示中的双线性关系结构，并测试模型编辑的传播效果。

Result: 发现双线性关系结构在隐藏表示中自然涌现，这种结构显著缓解了反转诅咒，并确保模型编辑能正确传播到反向事实和其他逻辑相关事实。

Conclusion: 模型编辑的成功不仅取决于编辑算法，更关键的是被修改知识的底层表示几何结构。双线性关系结构是实现逻辑一致性的关键因素。

Abstract: The reversal curse -- a language model's (LM) inability to infer an unseen
fact ``B is A'' from a learned fact ``A is B'' -- is widely considered a
fundamental limitation. We show that this is not an inherent failure but an
artifact of how models encode knowledge. By training LMs from scratch on a
synthetic dataset of relational knowledge graphs, we demonstrate that bilinear
relational structure emerges in their hidden representations. This structure
substantially alleviates the reversal curse, enabling LMs to infer unseen
reverse facts. Crucially, we also find that this bilinear structure plays a key
role in consistent model editing. When a fact is updated in a LM with this
structure, the edit correctly propagates to its reverse and other logically
dependent facts. In contrast, models lacking this representation not only
suffer from the reversal curse but also fail to generalize edits, further
introducing logical inconsistencies. Our results establish that training on a
relational knowledge dataset induces the emergence of bilinear internal
representations, which in turn enable LMs to behave in a logically consistent
manner after editing. This implies that the success of model editing depends
critically not just on editing algorithms but on the underlying
representational geometry of the knowledge being modified.

Motivation: 现有代理基准测试往往将代理推理与复杂的数学推理、专家级知识等能力混合，难以单独评估代理推理能力。

Method: 构建GSM-Agent基准，要求LLM代理在只有问题提示的情况下，主动使用工具收集解决小学数学问题所需的前提信息。提出代理推理图概念来分析和理解推理模式。

Result: 即使是GPT-5等前沿模型在GSM-Agent上准确率仅为67%。发现许多模型在代理推理中缺乏重新访问先前节点的能力。

Conclusion: 提出的基准和代理推理框架有助于未来理解和推进代理推理边界的研究，并开发了工具增强的测试时缩放方法来提高代理推理性能。

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, agentic reasoning - the ability
to combine tool use, especially search, and reasoning - becomes a critical
skill. However, it is hard to disentangle agentic reasoning when evaluated in
complex environments and tasks. Current agent benchmarks often mix agentic
reasoning with challenging math reasoning, expert-level knowledge, and other
advanced capabilities. To fill this gap, we build a novel benchmark, GSM-Agent,
where an LLM agent is required to solve grade-school-level reasoning problems,
but is only presented with the question in the prompt without the premises that
contain the necessary information to solve the task, and needs to proactively
collect that information using tools. Although the original tasks are
grade-school math problems, we observe that even frontier models like GPT-5
only achieve 67% accuracy. To understand and analyze the agentic reasoning
patterns, we propose the concept of agentic reasoning graph: cluster the
environment's document embeddings into nodes, and map each tool call to its
nearest node to build a reasoning path. Surprisingly, we identify that the
ability to revisit a previously visited node, widely taken as a crucial pattern
in static reasoning, is often missing for agentic reasoning for many models.
Based on the insight, we propose a tool-augmented test-time scaling method to
improve LLM's agentic reasoning performance by adding tools to encourage models
to revisit. We expect our benchmark and the agentic reasoning framework to aid
future studies of understanding and pushing the boundaries of agentic
reasoning.

Abstract: The growing demand for large language models (LLMs) with tunable reasoning
capabilities in many real-world applications highlights a critical need for
methods that can efficiently produce a spectrum of models balancing reasoning
depth and computational cost. Model merging has emerged as a promising,
training-free technique to address this challenge by arithmetically combining
the weights of a general-purpose model with a specialized reasoning model.
While various merging techniques exist, their potential to create a spectrum of
models with fine-grained control over reasoning abilities remains largely
unexplored. This work presents a large-scale empirical study evaluating a range
of model merging techniques across multiple reasoning benchmarks. We
systematically vary merging strengths to construct accuracy-efficiency curves,
providing the first comprehensive view of the tunable performance landscape.
Our findings reveal that model merging offers an effective and controllable
method for calibrating the trade-off between reasoning accuracy and token
efficiency, even when parent models have highly divergent weight spaces.
Crucially, we identify instances of Pareto Improvement, where a merged model
achieves both higher accuracy and lower token consumption than one of its
parents. Our study provides the first comprehensive analysis of this tunable
space, offering practical guidelines for creating LLMs with specific reasoning
profiles to meet diverse application demands.

Motivation: 现有大推理模型在单次尝试中的表现与其潜在能力之间存在显著差距，需要通过多路径推理来挖掘模型的真实潜力。

Method: 采用两阶段推理框架：探索器模型并行生成多个潜在解决方案，合成器模型整合这些参考进行更精细的第二阶段推理。

Result: Qwen3-8B-distill模型性能提升75%；A2R-Efficient变体（4B探索器+8B合成器）超越32B单体模型性能，成本降低30%。

Conclusion: A2R不仅是一个性能提升框架，更是实际应用中高效实用的解决方案，能够有效弥合模型潜力与实际表现之间的差距。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models have achieved significant improvements in
complex task-solving capabilities by allocating more computation at the
inference stage with a "thinking longer" paradigm. Even as the foundational
reasoning capabilities of models advance rapidly, the persistent gap between a
model's performance in a single attempt and its latent potential, often
revealed only across multiple solution paths, starkly highlights the disparity
between its realized and inherent capabilities. To address this, we present
A2R, an Asymmetric Two-Stage Reasoning framework designed to explicitly bridge
the gap between a model's potential and its actual performance. In this
framework, an "explorer" model first generates potential solutions in parallel
through repeated sampling. Subsequently,a "synthesizer" model integrates these
references for a more refined, second stage of reasoning. This two-stage
process allows computation to be scaled orthogonally to existing sequential
methods. Our work makes two key innovations: First, we present A2R as a
plug-and-play parallel reasoning framework that explicitly enhances a model's
capabilities on complex questions. For example, using our framework, the
Qwen3-8B-distill model achieves a 75% performance improvement compared to its
self-consistency baseline. Second, through a systematic analysis of the
explorer and synthesizer roles, we identify an effective asymmetric scaling
paradigm. This insight leads to A2R-Efficient, a "small-to-big" variant that
combines a Qwen3-4B explorer with a Qwen3-8B synthesizer. This configuration
surpasses the average performance of a monolithic Qwen3-32B model at a nearly
30% lower cost. Collectively, these results show that A2R is not only a
performance-boosting framework but also an efficient and practical solution for

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种多目标搜索的广义问题表述，通过隐藏目标的聚合函数来优化解决方案目标，支持标准MOS算法的应用，在多个机器人规划问题中验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实机器人系统需要同时平衡多个冲突目标，但现有复杂目标交互的问题表述无法直接使用最先进的多目标搜索算法。

Method: 提出广义问题表述，通过聚合函数优化隐藏目标，仅需适当扩展核心操作即可应用标准MOS算法。

Result: 在导航、操作、医疗系统规划、检查规划和路线规划等多个机器人问题中验证，扩展后的算法比原始版本性能提升数个数量级。

Conclusion: 该广义表述支持标准MOS算法的应用，通过适当扩展核心操作即可有效解决复杂多目标机器人规划问题。

Abstract: Multi-objective search (MOS) has become essential in robotics, as real-world
robotic systems need to simultaneously balance multiple, often conflicting
objectives. Recent works explore complex interactions between objectives,
leading to problem formulations that do not allow the usage of out-of-the-box
state-of-the-art MOS algorithms. In this paper, we suggest a generalized
problem formulation that optimizes solution objectives via aggregation
functions of hidden (search) objectives. We show that our formulation supports
the application of standard MOS algorithms, necessitating only to properly
extend several core operations to reflect the specific aggregation functions
employed. We demonstrate our approach in several diverse robotics planning
problems, spanning motion-planning for navigation, manipulation and planning fr
medical systems under obstacle uncertainty as well as inspection planning, and
route planning with different road types. We solve the problems using
state-of-the-art MOS algorithms after properly extending their core operations,
and provide empirical evidence that they outperform by orders of magnitude the
vanilla versions of the algorithms applied to the same problems but without
objective aggregation.

*Raphael Fischer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究系统评估了AI模型能耗估算工具的准确性，通过与真实测量数据对比发现现有工具存在高达40%的误差，为可持续AI发展提供了实证依据和改进指南。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI快速发展带来的环境影响日益显著，虽然已有ML Emissions Calculator和CodeCarbon等能耗估算工具，但它们基于实用假设并忽略重要因素，其估算准确性需要验证。

Method: 通过提出的验证框架，在数百个AI实验中比较静态和动态能耗估算方法与真实测量数据，系统评估估算可靠性。

Result: 研究表明，虽然现有估算方法大致遵循AI能耗模式，但持续存在高达40%的误差，揭示了估算不准确的问题。

Conclusion: 本研究为资源感知型机器学习和AI可持续性研究做出重要贡献，通过提供能耗估算质量的实证证据，建立了透明度并验证了广泛使用的工具，同时提出了改进指南和扩展验证的代码。

Abstract: Although machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) present
fascinating opportunities for innovation, their rapid development is also
significantly impacting our environment. In response to growing
resource-awareness in the field, quantification tools such as the ML Emissions
Calculator and CodeCarbon were developed to estimate the energy consumption and
carbon emissions of running AI models. They are easy to incorporate into AI
projects, however also make pragmatic assumptions and neglect important
factors, raising the question of estimation accuracy. This study systematically
evaluates the reliability of static and dynamic energy estimation approaches
through comparisons with ground-truth measurements across hundreds of AI
experiments. Based on the proposed validation framework, investigative insights
into AI energy demand and estimation inaccuracies are provided. While generally
following the patterns of AI energy consumption, the established estimation
approaches are shown to consistently make errors of up to 40%. By providing
empirical evidence on energy estimation quality and errors, this study
establishes transparency and validates widely used tools for sustainable AI
development. It moreover formulates guidelines for improving the
state-of-the-art and offers code for extending the validation to other domains
and tools, thus making important contributions to resource-aware ML and AI
sustainability research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文主张在机器学习评估中考虑标注不确定性，使用概率指标来直接处理分布，以更好地反映临床数据的真实情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床数据集标注存在不确定性和标注者分歧，传统聚合方法（如多数投票）掩盖了这种变异性，影响模型评估的准确性。

Method: 提出使用概率指标来评估模型，这些指标直接操作于分布，适用于各种标注生成过程（简单计数、主观置信度评级或概率响应模型），计算轻量且高效。

Result: 在医学影像基准测试的简单实验中，考虑二元标签的置信度显著影响模型排名，表明不确定性感知评估的重要性。

Conclusion: 呼吁社区发布原始标注数据并采用不确定性感知评估，使性能估计更好地反映临床数据特性。

Abstract: Clinical dataset labels are rarely certain as annotators disagree and
confidence is not uniform across cases. Typical aggregation procedures, such as
majority voting, obscure this variability. In simple experiments on medical
imaging benchmarks, accounting for the confidence in binary labels
significantly impacts model rankings. We therefore argue that machine-learning
evaluations should explicitly account for annotation uncertainty using
probabilistic metrics that directly operate on distributions. These metrics can
be applied independently of the annotations' generating process, whether
modeled by simple counting, subjective confidence ratings, or probabilistic
response models. They are also computationally lightweight, as closed-form
expressions have linear-time implementations once examples are sorted by model
score. We thus urge the community to release raw annotations for datasets and
to adopt uncertainty-aware evaluation so that performance estimates may better
reflect clinical data.

Abstract: This paper presents an evaluation framework for assessing Large Language
Models' (LLMs) capabilities in combinatorial optimization, specifically
addressing the 2D bin-packing problem. We introduce a systematic methodology
that combines LLMs with evolutionary algorithms to generate and refine
heuristic solutions iteratively. Through comprehensive experiments comparing
LLM generated heuristics against traditional approaches (Finite First-Fit and
Hybrid First-Fit), we demonstrate that LLMs can produce more efficient
solutions while requiring fewer computational resources. Our evaluation reveals
that GPT-4o achieves optimal solutions within two iterations, reducing average
bin usage from 16 to 15 bins while improving space utilization from 0.76-0.78
to 0.83. This work contributes to understanding LLM evaluation in specialized
domains and establishes benchmarks for assessing LLM performance in

Conclusion: 通过解决数据质量、训练效率和领域特定知识提取等关键挑战，为医疗保健领域提供更可靠有效的AI驱动解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable potential in
various domains, yet their application in the medical field is hindered by
several challenges. General-purpose MLLMs often lack the specialized knowledge
required for medical tasks, leading to uncertain or hallucinatory responses.
Knowledge distillation from advanced models struggles to capture
domain-specific expertise in radiology and pharmacology. Additionally, the
computational cost of continual pretraining with large-scale medical data poses
significant efficiency challenges. To address these issues, we propose
InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B and InfiMed-Foundation-4B, two medical-specific MLLMs
designed to deliver state-of-the-art performance in medical applications. We
combined high-quality general-purpose and medical multimodal data and proposed
a novel five-dimensional quality assessment framework to curate high-quality
multimodal medical datasets. We employ low-to-high image resolution and
multimodal sequence packing to enhance training efficiency, enabling the
integration of extensive medical data. Furthermore, a three-stage supervised
fine-tuning process ensures effective knowledge extraction for complex medical
tasks. Evaluated on the MedEvalKit framework, InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B
outperforms Qwen2.5VL-3B, while InfiMed-Foundation-4B surpasses HuatuoGPT-V-7B
and MedGemma-27B-IT, demonstrating superior performance in medical visual
question answering and diagnostic tasks. By addressing key challenges in data
quality, training efficiency, and domain-specific knowledge extraction, our
work paves the way for more reliable and effective AI-driven solutions in
healthcare. InfiMed-Foundation-4B model is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出PD-SSM方法，使用结构化稀疏参数化状态转移矩阵，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升状态空间模型表达有限状态自动机的能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有状态空间模型使用对角化转移矩阵计算高效但表达能力受限，而完全非结构化矩阵计算成本过高。需要找到平衡计算效率和表达能力的解决方案

Method: 将转移矩阵参数化为列独热矩阵(P)和复值对角矩阵(D)的乘积，使并行扫描计算成本与状态大小线性相关

Result: 模型能够最优模拟任意N状态有限状态自动机，在FSA状态跟踪任务上显著优于现有SSM变体，在时间序列分类上与神经控制微分方程性能相当

Conclusion: PD-SSM在保持计算效率的同时实现了最优的状态跟踪能力，为SSM在复杂序列建模任务中的应用提供了新可能

Abstract: Modern state-space models (SSMs) often utilize transition matrices which
enable efficient computation but pose restrictions on the model's expressivity,
as measured in terms of the ability to emulate finite-state automata (FSA).
While unstructured transition matrices are optimal in terms of expressivity,
they come at a prohibitively high compute and memory cost even for moderate
state sizes. We propose a structured sparse parametrization of transition
matrices in SSMs that enables FSA state tracking with optimal state size and
depth, while keeping the computational cost of the recurrence comparable to
that of diagonal SSMs. Our method, PD-SSM, parametrizes the transition matrix
as the product of a column one-hot matrix ($P$) and a complex-valued diagonal
matrix ($D$). Consequently, the computational cost of parallel scans scales
linearly with the state size. Theoretically, the model is BIBO-stable and can
emulate any $N$-state FSA with one layer of dimension $N$ and a linear readout
of size $N \times N$, significantly improving on all current structured SSM
guarantees. Experimentally, the model significantly outperforms a wide
collection of modern SSM variants on various FSA state tracking tasks. On
multiclass time-series classification, the performance is comparable to that of
neural controlled differential equations, a paradigm explicitly built for
time-series analysis. Finally, we integrate PD-SSM into a hybrid
Transformer-SSM architecture and demonstrate that the model can effectively
track the states of a complex FSA in which transitions are encoded as a set of
variable-length English sentences. The code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种更简单的反事实生成方法，将LLM表示为非确定性因果模型，相比现有方法更直接适用于任何黑盒LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在解释LLM时存在歧义：既不按字面解释（假设可以改变采样实现而不改变LLM本身），也不按意图解释（将非确定性LLM表示为确定性因果模型）。

Method: 基于LLM的意图解释，将其表示为非确定性因果模型，这种方法对任何黑盒LLM都直接适用且无需修改。

Result: 新方法更简单且实现无关，而现有方法直接实现了特定类型的反事实生成，适用于某些目的但不适用于其他目的。

Conclusion: 为基于LLM意图语义的反事实推理提供了理论基础，为特定应用的反事实生成方法奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent work by Chatzi et al. and Ravfogel et al. has developed, for the first
time, a method for generating counterfactuals of probabilistic Large Language
Models. Such counterfactuals tell us what would - or might - have been the
output of an LLM if some factual prompt ${\bf x}$ had been ${\bf x}^*$ instead.
The ability to generate such counterfactuals is an important necessary step
towards explaining, evaluating, and comparing, the behavior of LLMs. I argue,
however, that the existing method rests on an ambiguous interpretation of LLMs:
it does not interpret LLMs literally, for the method involves the assumption
that one can change the implementation of an LLM's sampling process without
changing the LLM itself, nor does it interpret LLMs as intended, for the method
involves explicitly representing a nondeterministic LLM as a deterministic
causal model. I here present a much simpler method for generating
counterfactuals that is based on an LLM's intended interpretation by
representing it as a nondeterministic causal model instead. The advantage of my
simpler method is that it is directly applicable to any black-box LLM without
modification, as it is agnostic to any implementation details. The advantage of
the existing method, on the other hand, is that it directly implements the
generation of a specific type of counterfactuals that is useful for certain
purposes, but not for others. I clarify how both methods relate by offering a
theoretical foundation for reasoning about counterfactuals in LLMs based on
their intended semantics, thereby laying the groundwork for novel
application-specific methods for generating counterfactuals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受《思考，快与慢》中人类双过程认知理论的启发，旨在让LLM更接近人类的认知过程，在效率和准确性之间取得平衡。

Method: 首先使用快速思维智能体（系统1）生成快速答案，如果检测到不确定性，则触发结构化的系统2推理管道，包括规划、假设生成、检索、信息整合和决策等专门智能体。

Result: 实验结果显示，PRIME使开源LLaMA 3模型在需要多跳和知识基础推理的基准测试中，能够与GPT-4、GPT-4o等最先进的闭源模型竞争。

Conclusion: PRIME为改善LLM在需要复杂、知识密集型推理领域的性能提供了一个可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition from \textit{Thinking,
Fast and Slow}, we introduce \textbf{PRIME} (Planning and Retrieval-Integrated
Memory for Enhanced Reasoning), a multi-agent reasoning framework that
dynamically integrates \textbf{System 1} (fast, intuitive thinking) and
\textbf{System 2} (slow, deliberate thinking). PRIME first employs a Quick
Thinking Agent (System 1) to generate a rapid answer; if uncertainty is
detected, it then triggers a structured System 2 reasoning pipeline composed of
specialized agents for \textit{planning}, \textit{hypothesis generation},
\textit{retrieval}, \textit{information integration}, and
\textit{decision-making}. This multi-agent design faithfully mimics human
cognitive processes and enhances both efficiency and accuracy. Experimental
results with LLaMA 3 models demonstrate that PRIME enables open-source LLMs to
perform competitively with state-of-the-art closed-source models like GPT-4 and
GPT-4o on benchmarks requiring multi-hop and knowledge-grounded reasoning. This
research establishes PRIME as a scalable solution for improving LLMs in domains
requiring complex, knowledge-intensive reasoning.

SeekBench comprises 190 expert-annotated traces with over 1,800 response steps
generated by LLM search agents, each enriched with evidence annotations for
granular analysis of whether agents (1) generate reasoning steps grounded in
observed evidence, (2) adaptively reformulate searches to recover from
low-quality results, and (3) have proper calibration to correctly assess
whether the current evidence is sufficient for providing an answer.

Motivation: 收集大规模真实机器人操作数据成本高昂且耗时，限制了VLA模型的泛化能力。需要一种方法能够利用有限真实数据生成多样化训练数据。

Method: 使用DreamTransfer框架进行文本控制的机器人视频视觉编辑，保持3D结构和几何合理性；采用AdaMix训练策略动态调整训练批次权重，关注感知或运动学上的困难样本。

Result: 生成的视频在多视角一致性、几何保真度和文本条件准确性上显著优于现有方法；在零样本视觉域的真实机器人操作任务中，相比仅使用真实数据训练，性能提升超过200%，结合AdaMix可再提升13%。

Conclusion: EMMA框架通过生成数据和混合训练策略，有效解决了机器人操作数据稀缺问题，显著提升了VLA模型的泛化性能。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models increasingly rely on diverse training
data to achieve robust generalization. However, collecting large-scale
real-world robot manipulation data across varied object appearances and
environmental conditions remains prohibitively time-consuming and expensive. To
overcome this bottleneck, we propose Embodied Manipulation Media Adaptation
(EMMA), a VLA policy enhancement framework that integrates a generative data
engine with an effective training pipeline. We introduce DreamTransfer, a
diffusion Transformer-based framework for generating multi-view consistent,
geometrically grounded embodied manipulation videos. DreamTransfer enables
text-controlled visual editing of robot videos, transforming foreground,
background, and lighting conditions without compromising 3D structure or
geometrical plausibility. Furthermore, we explore hybrid training with real and
generated data, and introduce AdaMix, a hard-sample-aware training strategy
that dynamically reweights training batches to focus optimization on
perceptually or kinematically challenging samples. Extensive experiments show
that videos generated by DreamTransfer significantly outperform prior video
generation methods in multi-view consistency, geometric fidelity, and
text-conditioning accuracy. Crucially, VLAs trained with generated data enable
robots to generalize to unseen object categories and novel visual domains using
only demonstrations from a single appearance. In real-world robotic
manipulation tasks with zero-shot visual domains, our approach achieves over a
200% relative performance gain compared to training on real data alone, and
further improves by 13% with AdaMix, demonstrating its effectiveness in
boosting policy generalization.

Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型将图表视为静态图像，缺乏动态操作能力，而人类几何推理涉及辅助线构造和仿射变换等动态操作。

Method: 集成三个模块：感知模块将图表抽象为结构化逻辑形式，符号推理模块应用几何定理决定下一步推理步骤，草图操作模块执行绘制辅助线或应用变换等操作。采用两阶段训练：监督微调和强化学习。

Result: 在GeoSketch基准测试上，GeoSketch显著提高了逐步推理准确性和问题解决成功率，优于静态感知方法。

Conclusion: 通过统一分层决策、可执行视觉动作和符号验证，GeoSketch将多模态推理从静态解释推进到动态可验证交互，为复杂视觉空间问题解决奠定新基础。

Abstract: Geometric Problem Solving (GPS) poses a unique challenge for Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs), requiring not only the joint interpretation of text
and diagrams but also iterative visuospatial reasoning. While existing
approaches process diagrams as static images, they lack the capacity for
dynamic manipulation - a core aspect of human geometric reasoning involving
auxiliary line construction and affine transformations. We present GeoSketch, a
neural-symbolic framework that recasts geometric reasoning as an interactive
perception-reasoning-action loop. GeoSketch integrates: (1) a Perception module
that abstracts diagrams into structured logic forms, (2) a Symbolic Reasoning
module that applies geometric theorems to decide the next deductive step, and
(3) a Sketch Action module that executes operations such as drawing auxiliary
lines or applying transformations, thereby updating the diagram in a closed
loop. To train this agent, we develop a two-stage pipeline: supervised
fine-tuning on 2,000 symbolic-curated trajectories followed by reinforcement
learning with dense, symbolic rewards to enhance robustness and strategic
exploration. To evaluate this paradigm, we introduce the GeoSketch Benchmark, a
high-quality set of 390 geometry problems requiring auxiliary construction or
affine transformations. Experiments on strong MLLM baselines demonstrate that
GeoSketch significantly improves stepwise reasoning accuracy and
problem-solving success over static perception methods. By unifying
hierarchical decision-making, executable visual actions, and symbolic
verification, GeoSketch advances multimodal reasoning from static
interpretation to dynamic, verifiable interaction, establishing a new
foundation for solving complex visuospatial problems.

Conclusion: 赋能是评估复杂开放环境中语言模型智能体的有前景的通用指标。

Abstract: As language model (LM) agents become more capable and gain broader access to
real-world tools, there is a growing need for scalable evaluation frameworks of
agentic capability. However, conventional benchmark-centric evaluations are
costly to design and require human designers to come up with valid tasks that
translate into insights about general model capabilities. In this work, we
propose information-theoretic evaluation based on empowerment, the mutual
information between an agent's actions and future states, as an open-ended
method for evaluating LM agents. We introduce EELMA (Estimating Empowerment of
Language Model Agents), an algorithm for approximating effective empowerment
from multi-turn text interactions. We validate EELMA on both language games and
scaled-up realistic web-browsing scenarios. We find that empowerment strongly
correlates with average task performance, characterize the impact of
environmental complexity and agentic factors such as chain-of-thought, model
scale, and memory length on estimated empowerment, and that high empowerment
states and actions are often pivotal moments for general capabilities.
Together, these results demonstrate empowerment as an appealing general-purpose
metric for evaluating and monitoring LM agents in complex, open-ended settings.

Abstract: This paper introduces TrueGradeAI, an AI-driven digital examination framework
designed to overcome the shortcomings of traditional paper-based assessments,
including excessive paper usage, logistical complexity, grading delays, and
evaluator bias. The system preserves natural handwriting by capturing stylus
input on secure tablets and applying transformer-based optical character
recognition for transcription. Evaluation is conducted through a
retrieval-augmented pipeline that integrates faculty solutions, cache layers,
and external references, enabling a large language model to assign scores with
explicit, evidence-linked reasoning. Unlike prior tablet-based exam systems
that primarily digitize responses, TrueGradeAI advances the field by
incorporating explainable automation, bias mitigation, and auditable grading
trails. By uniting handwriting preservation with scalable and transparent
evaluation, the framework reduces environmental costs, accelerates feedback
cycles, and progressively builds a reusable knowledge base, while actively
working to mitigate grading bias and ensure fairness in assessment.

provide a measurable geometric analysis perspective, we define the concept of
the Reasoning Manifold, a latent low-dimensional geometric structure formed by
the internal representations corresponding to all correctly reasoned
generations. This structure can be conceptualized as the embodiment of the
effective thinking paths that the model has learned to successfully solve a
given task. Based on this concept, we build REMA, a framework that explains the
origins of failures by quantitatively comparing the spatial relationships of
internal model representations corresponding to both erroneous and correct
reasoning samples. Specifically, REMA first quantifies the geometric deviation
of each erroneous representation by calculating its k-nearest neighbors
distance to the approximated manifold formed by correct representations,
thereby providing a unified failure signal. It then localizes the divergence
points where these deviations first become significant by tracking this
deviation metric across the model's layers and comparing it against a baseline
of internal fluctuations from correct representations, thus identifying where
the reasoning chain begins to go off-track. Our extensive experiments on
diverse language and multimodal models and tasks demonstrate the
low-dimensional nature of the reasoning manifold and the high separability
between erroneous and correct reasoning representations. The results also
validate the effectiveness of the REMA framework in analyzing the origins of
reasoning failures. This research connects abstract reasoning failures to
measurable geometric deviations in representations, providing new avenues for
in-depth understanding and diagnosis of the internal computational processes of
black-box models.

### [421] [The Emergence of Altruism in Large-Language-Model Agents Society](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22537)
*Haoyang Li,Xiao Jia,Zhanzhan Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在社会模拟中表现出两种不同的社会倾向："适应性利己主义者"默认优先考虑自身利益但在社会规范影响下会增加利他行为，而"利他优化者"则表现出固有的利他逻辑，始终优先集体利益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注小规模任务导向游戏中的合作，忽略了大规模智能体社会中利他主义的涌现。需要理解LLM代理所体现的社会逻辑，这对计算社会科学至关重要。

Method: 引入Schelling变体城市迁移模型，创建社会困境，让200多个LLM代理在利己（个人效用）和利他（系统效用）目标之间导航。采用扎根理论启发的方法系统编码代理推理过程。

Result: 识别出两种不同的社会倾向原型，发现社会规范设置信息板能显著增加"适应性利己主义者"的利他行为。不同LLM在利己和利他倾向上存在内在异质性。

Conclusion: 对于社会模拟，模型选择不仅是选择推理能力，更是选择内在的社会行动逻辑。"适应性利己主义者"更适合模拟复杂人类社会，而"利他优化者"更适合模拟理想化的亲社会行为者。

Abstract: Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for social simulation is a frontier
in computational social science. Understanding the social logics these agents
embody is critical to this attempt. However, existing research has primarily
focused on cooperation in small-scale, task-oriented games, overlooking how
altruism, which means sacrificing self-interest for collective benefit, emerges
in large-scale agent societies. To address this gap, we introduce a
Schelling-variant urban migration model that creates a social dilemma,
compelling over 200 LLM agents to navigate an explicit conflict between
egoistic (personal utility) and altruistic (system utility) goals. Our central
finding is a fundamental difference in the social tendencies of LLMs. We
identify two distinct archetypes: "Adaptive Egoists", which default to
prioritizing self-interest but whose altruistic behaviors significantly
increase under the influence of a social norm-setting message board; and
"Altruistic Optimizers", which exhibit an inherent altruistic logic,
consistently prioritizing collective benefit even at a direct cost to
themselves. Furthermore, to qualitatively analyze the cognitive underpinnings
of these decisions, we introduce a method inspired by Grounded Theory to
systematically code agent reasoning. In summary, this research provides the
first evidence of intrinsic heterogeneity in the egoistic and altruistic
tendencies of different LLMs. We propose that for social simulation, model
selection is not merely a matter of choosing reasoning capability, but of
choosing an intrinsic social action logic. While "Adaptive Egoists" may offer a
more suitable choice for simulating complex human societies, "Altruistic
Optimizers" are better suited for modeling idealized pro-social actors or
scenarios where collective welfare is the primary consideration.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StepORLM是一个自演化的LLM框架，通过生成式过程监督解决运筹学问题，采用策略模型和生成过程奖励模型的协同进化循环，在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在两个关键局限：结果奖励存在信用分配问题，正确的最终答案可能强化错误推理；传统判别式过程监督短视，无法全面评估运筹学建模的相互依赖步骤。

Method: StepORLM采用协同进化循环，策略模型和生成过程奖励模型相互迭代改进。通过双重反馈机制：外部求解器的确定性结果验证和GenPRM的细致过程评估，结合加权直接偏好优化对齐策略并同时优化GenPRM。

Result: 8B参数的StepORLM在六个基准测试中达到新的最先进水平，显著优于更大规模的通用模型、代理方法和专业基线。协同进化的GenPRM可作为强大且普遍适用的过程验证器，大幅提升自身模型和其他现有LLM的推理扩展性能。

Conclusion: StepORLM通过生成式过程监督和协同进化框架有效解决了运筹学问题中的信用分配和过程评估问题，证明了该方法在提升LLM解决复杂问题能力方面的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities for solving
Operations Research (OR) problems. While reinforcement learning serves as a
powerful paradigm for LLM training on OR problems, existing works generally
face two key limitations. First, outcome reward suffers from the credit
assignment problem, where correct final answers can reinforce flawed reasoning.
Second, conventional discriminative process supervision is myopic, failing to
evaluate the interdependent steps of OR modeling holistically. To this end, we
introduce StepORLM, a novel self-evolving framework with generative process
supervision. At its core, StepORLM features a co-evolutionary loop where a
policy model and a generative process reward model (GenPRM) iteratively improve
on each other. This loop is driven by a dual-feedback mechanism: definitive,
outcome-based verification from an external solver, and nuanced, holistic
process evaluation from the GenPRM. The combined signal is used to align the
policy via Weighted Direct Preference Optimization (W-DPO) and simultaneously
refine the GenPRM. Our resulting 8B-parameter StepORLM establishes a new
state-of-the-art across six benchmarks, significantly outperforming vastly
larger generalist models, agentic methods, and specialized baselines. Moreover,
the co-evolved GenPRM is able to act as a powerful and universally applicable
process verifier, substantially boosting the inference scaling performance of
both our own model and other existing LLMs.

TL;DR: UniMIC是一个统一的多模态交互编码框架，使用紧凑的标记化表示作为通信媒介，在保持与大型多模态模型兼容的同时实现高效低比特率传输。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有编解码器仍针对单模态单向通信优化，在传统的压缩-传输-重建流程中会导致重复的质量下降，无法满足多模态双向交互的需求。

Method: 采用基于标记的紧凑表示作为通信媒介，使用轻量级Transformer熵模型（通用、掩码和文本条件三种设计）来最小化标记间冗余。

Result: 在文本到图像生成、文本引导修复、扩展和视觉问答等任务上，UniMIC实现了显著的比特率节省，在超低比特率（<0.05bpp）下仍保持鲁棒性，且不影响下游任务性能。

Conclusion: UniMIC为下一代多模态交互通信提供了一个实用且前瞻性的范式。

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and cloud-based AI
agents is transforming human-AI collaboration into bidirectional, multimodal
interaction. However, existing codecs remain optimized for unimodal, one-way
communication, resulting in repeated degradation under conventional
compress-transmit-reconstruct pipelines. To address this limitation, we propose
UniMIC, a Unified token-based Multimodal Interactive Coding framework that
bridges edge devices and cloud AI agents. Instead of transmitting raw pixels or
plain text, UniMIC employs compact tokenized representations as the
communication medium, enabling efficient low-bitrate transmission while
maintaining compatibility with LMMs. To further enhance compression,
lightweight Transformer-based entropy models with scenario-specific
designs-generic, masked, and text-conditioned-effectively minimize inter-token
redundancy. Extensive experiments on text-to-image generation, text-guided
inpainting, outpainting, and visual question answering show that UniMIC
achieves substantial bitrate savings and remains robust even at ultra-low
bitrates (<0.05bpp), without compromising downstream task performance. These
results establish UniMIC as a practical and forward-looking paradigm for
next-generation multimodal interactive communication.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了动态专家搜索（DES）方法，通过控制MoE模型中激活的专家数量来增强推理能力，无需额外成本即可提高准确性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时扩展方法主要依赖输出级采样，忽视了模型架构的作用。在MoE模型中，观察到改变激活专家数量可以产生互补的解决方案集，这揭示了一个未被充分探索的多样性来源。

Method: DES包含两个关键组件：动态MoE（在推理时直接控制专家数量生成多样推理轨迹）和专家配置继承（在推理路径内保持一致的专家数量，在运行间变化以平衡稳定性和多样性）。

Result: 在MoE架构、验证器和推理基准测试（数学、代码和知识）上的广泛实验表明，DES可靠地优于TTS基线，无需额外成本即可提高准确性和稳定性。

Conclusion: DES作为一种实用且可扩展的架构感知TTS形式，展示了现代LLM中结构灵活性如何推动推理能力的进步。

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) enhances the reasoning ability of large language
models (LLMs) by allocating additional computation during inference. However,
existing approaches primarily rely on output-level sampling while overlooking
the role of model architecture. In mainstream Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs, we
observe that varying the number of activated experts yields complementary
solution sets with stable accuracy, revealing a new and underexplored source of
diversity. Motivated by this observation, we propose Dynamic Experts Search
(DES), a TTS strategy that elevates expert activation into a controllable
dimension of the search space. DES integrates two key components: (1) Dynamic
MoE, which enables direct control of expert counts during inference to generate
diverse reasoning trajectories without additional cost; and (2) Expert
Configuration Inheritance, which preserves consistent expert counts within a
reasoning path while varying them across runs, thereby balancing stability and
diversity throughout the search. Extensive experiments across MoE
architectures, verifiers and reasoning benchmarks (i.e., math, code and
knowledge) demonstrate that DES reliably outperforms TTS baselines, enhancing
accuracy and stability without additional cost. These results highlight DES as
a practical and scalable form of architecture-aware TTS, illustrating how
structural flexibility in modern LLMs can advance reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文通过图抽象分析RL在LLM规划中的理论机制，发现SFT会产生伪相关解，而RL通过探索实现正确规划。但PG存在多样性崩溃问题，Q-learning则能保持多样性并避免奖励hacking。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然RL方法显著提升了LLM的规划能力，但其有效性的理论基础尚不明确，需要系统分析RL在规划任务中的优势和局限。

Method: 使用基于图的抽象模型，分析策略梯度(PG)和Q-learning方法在规划任务中的表现，并在Blocksworld基准上进行实证验证。

Result: SFT会产生基于共现的伪相关解；RL通过探索实现更好的泛化；PG存在多样性崩溃问题；Q-learning能保持多样性但需要精心设计奖励函数。

Conclusion: 探索是RL实现正确规划的关键机制，Q-learning在多样性保持方面优于PG，但需要谨慎的奖励设计来避免奖励hacking问题。

Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning (RL) methods have substantially enhanced the
planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the theoretical
basis for their effectiveness remains elusive. In this work, we investigate
RL's benefits and limitations through a tractable graph-based abstraction,
focusing on policy gradient (PG) and Q-learning methods. Our theoretical
analyses reveal that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) may introduce
co-occurrence-based spurious solutions, whereas RL achieves correct planning
primarily through exploration, underscoring exploration's role in enabling
better generalization. However, we also show that PG suffers from diversity
collapse, where output diversity decreases during training and persists even
after perfect accuracy is attained. By contrast, Q-learning provides two key
advantages: off-policy learning and diversity preservation at convergence. We
further demonstrate that careful reward design is necessary to prevent reward
hacking in Q-learning. Finally, applying our framework to the real-world
planning benchmark Blocksworld, we confirm that these behaviors manifest in
practice.

TL;DR: VISION是一个端到端的自主检查系统，结合了视觉语言模型和约束视角规划，用于自主检查运河涵洞，无需领域特定的微调即可生成详细报告。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 运河涵洞（如1825年建造的伊利运河）需要频繁检查以确保安全运行，但人工检查面临年龄、几何形状、照明差、天气和难以接近等挑战。

Method: 将网络级视觉语言模型与约束视角规划相结合，通过简短提示获取开放词汇的感兴趣区域建议，融合立体深度恢复尺度，规划器在涵洞约束下指挥重新定位以捕获目标特写。

Result: 在伊利运河下的涵洞中部署在四足机器人上，VISION实现了完整的闭环检查。外部评估显示初始感兴趣区域建议与主题专家达成61.4%的一致性，最终重新成像后评估达到80%。

Conclusion: VISION能够将初步假设转化为基于事实的、与专家一致的发现，表明该系统在自主涵洞检查方面具有实用价值。

Abstract: Culverts on canals such as the Erie Canal, built originally in 1825, require
frequent inspections to ensure safe operation. Human inspection of culverts is
challenging due to age, geometry, poor illumination, weather, and lack of easy
access. We introduce VISION, an end-to-end, language-in-the-loop autonomy
system that couples a web-scale vision-language model (VLM) with constrained
viewpoint planning for autonomous inspection of culverts. Brief prompts to the
VLM solicit open-vocabulary ROI proposals with rationales and confidences,
stereo depth is fused to recover scale, and a planner -- aware of culvert
constraints -- commands repositioning moves to capture targeted close-ups.
Deployed on a quadruped in a culvert under the Erie Canal, VISION closes the
see, decide, move, re-image loop on-board and produces high-resolution images
for detailed reporting without domain-specific fine-tuning. In an external
evaluation by New York Canal Corporation personnel, initial ROI proposals
achieved 61.4\% agreement with subject-matter experts, and final
post-re-imaging assessments reached 80\%, indicating that VISION converts
tentative hypotheses into grounded, expert-aligned findings.

Conclusion: GeoGami平台为通过形状变换进入不同环境并利用形状变换进行运动的机器人开辟了新能力。

Abstract: This paper presents the design of a new soft-rigid robotic platform,
"GeoGami". We leverage origami surface capabilities to achieve shape
contraction and to support locomotion with underactuated forms. A key challenge
is that origami surfaces have high degrees of freedom and typically require
many actuators; we address repeatability by integrating surface compliance. We
propose a mono-actuated GeoGami mobile platform that combines origami surface
compliance with a geometric compliant skeleton, enabling the robot to transform
and locomote using a single actuator. We demonstrate the robot, develop a
stiffness model, and describe the central gearbox mechanism. We also analyze
alternative cable-driven actuation methods for the skeleton to enable surface
transformation. Finally, we evaluate the GeoGami platform for capabilities,
including shape transformation and rolling. This platform opens new
capabilities for robots that change shape to access different environments and
that use shape transformation for locomotion.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于四旋翼无人机近壁飞行的吸力补偿模型预测控制(SC-MPC)框架，包含物理吸力模型和优化控制器，显著提高了近壁飞行时的轨迹跟踪精度和稳定性。

Abstract: The safe operation of quadrotors in near-wall urban or indoor environments
(e.g., inspection and search-and-rescue missions) is challenged by unmodeled
aerodynamic effects arising from wall-proximity. It generates complex vortices
that induce destabilizing suction forces, potentially leading to hazardous
vibrations or collisions. This paper presents a comprehensive solution
featuring (1) a physics-based suction force model that explicitly characterizes
the dependency on both rotor speed and wall distance, and (2) a
suction-compensated model predictive control (SC-MPC) framework designed to
ensure accurate and stable trajectory tracking during wall-proximity
operations. The proposed SC-MPC framework incorporates an enhanced dynamics
model that accounts for suction force effects, formulated as a factor graph
optimization problem integrating system dynamics constraints, trajectory
tracking objectives, control input smoothness requirements, and actuator
physical limitations. The suction force model parameters are systematically
identified through extensive experimental measurements across varying
operational conditions. Experimental validation demonstrates SC-MPC's superior
performance, achieving 2.1 cm root mean squared error (RMSE) in X-axis and 2.0
cm RMSE in Y-axis position control - representing 74% and 79% improvements over
cascaded proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control, and 60% and 53%
improvements over standard MPC respectively. The corresponding mean absolute
error (MAE) metrics (1.2 cm X-axis, 1.4 cm Y-axis) similarly outperform both
baselines. The evaluation platform employs a ducted quadrotor design that
provides collision protection while maintaining aerodynamic efficiency. To
facilitate reproducibility and community adoption, we have open-sourced our
complete implementation, available at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SC-MPC-6A61.

Conclusion: DroneFL成功解决了多无人机目标跟踪中的联邦学习挑战，在保持高效性的同时显著提升了跟踪性能，为实际应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-robot target tracking is a fundamental problem that requires
coordinated monitoring of dynamic entities in applications such as precision
agriculture, environmental monitoring, disaster response, and security
surveillance. While Federated Learning (FL) has the potential to enhance
learning across multiple robots without centralized data aggregation, its use
in multi-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) target tracking remains largely
underexplored. Key challenges include limited onboard computational resources,
significant data heterogeneity in FL due to varying targets and the fields of
view, and the need for tight coupling between trajectory prediction and
multi-robot planning. In this paper, we introduce DroneFL, the first federated
learning framework specifically designed for efficient multi-UAV target
tracking. We design a lightweight local model to predict target trajectories
from sensor inputs, using a frozen YOLO backbone and a shallow transformer for
efficient onboard training. The updated models are periodically aggregated in
the cloud for global knowledge sharing. To alleviate the data heterogeneity
that hinders FL convergence, DroneFL introduces a position-invariant model
architecture with altitude-based adaptive instance normalization. Finally, we
fuse predictions from multiple UAVs in the cloud and generate optimal
trajectories that balance target prediction accuracy and overall tracking
performance. Our results show that DroneFL reduces prediction error by 6%-83%
and tracking distance by 0.4%-4.6% compared to a distributed non-FL framework.
In terms of efficiency, DroneFL runs in real time on a Raspberry Pi 5 and has
on average just 1.56 KBps data rate to the cloud.

Method: 基础模型生成规划领域，作为产生符号化问题-规划对的引擎，然后由同一模型将这些对转换为自然语言解释的扩展思维链轨迹，明确对齐符号规划结构与自然语言推理。

Result: 生成的数据超越了模型固有的规划能力，通过微调产生了规划增强的LLM，具有改进的规划成功率、更强的跨任务泛化能力和降低的推理成本。

Conclusion: Plan2Evolve框架成功地将符号规划与自然语言推理对齐，实现了LLM在机器人任务规划中的自我进化，显著提升了规划性能和效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown strong potential in robotic
task planning, particularly through automatic planning domain generation that
integrates symbolic search. Prior approaches, however, have largely treated
these domains as search utilities, with limited attention to their potential as
scalable sources of reasoning data. At the same time, progress in reasoning
LLMs has been driven by chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision, whose application
in robotics remains dependent on costly, human-curated datasets. We propose
Plan2Evolve, an LLM self-evolving framework in which the base model generates
planning domains that serve as engines for producing symbolic problem-plan
pairs as reasoning traces. These pairs are then transformed into extended CoT
trajectories by the same model through natural-language explanations, thereby
explicitly aligning symbolic planning structures with natural language
reasoning. The resulting data extend beyond the model's intrinsic planning
capacity, enabling model fine-tuning that yields a planning-enhanced LLM with
improved planning success, stronger cross-task generalization, and reduced
inference costs.

2D feature points and lines, enabling fast and robust line tracking and
triangulation while ensuring real-time performance; (ii) an SE(2)-constrained
SE(3) wheel pre-integration method that leverages the planar motion
characteristics of ground vehicles for accurate wheel updates; and (iii) an
efficient motion consistency check (MCC) that filters out dynamic features by

Abstract: Autonomous docking between Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and ground robots
is essential for heterogeneous systems, yet most existing approaches target
wheeled platforms whose limited mobility constrains exploration in complex
terrains. Quadruped robots offer superior adaptability but undergo frequent
posture variations, making it difficult to provide a stable landing surface for
UAVs. To address these challenges, we propose an autonomous UAV-quadruped
docking framework for GPS-denied environments. On the quadruped side, a Hybrid
Internal Model with Horizontal Alignment (HIM-HA), learned via deep
reinforcement learning, actively stabilizes the torso to provide a level
platform. On the UAV side, a three-phase strategy is adopted, consisting of
long-range acquisition with a median-filtered YOLOv8 detector, close-range
tracking with a constraint-aware controller that integrates a Nonsingular Fast
Terminal Sliding Mode Controller (NFTSMC) and a logarithmic Barrier Function
(BF) to guarantee finite-time error convergence under field-of-view (FOV)
constraints, and terminal descent guided by a Safety Period (SP) mechanism that
jointly verifies tracking accuracy and platform stability. The proposed
framework is validated in both simulation and real-world scenarios,
successfully achieving docking on outdoor staircases higher than 17 cm and
rough slopes steeper than 30 degrees. Supplementary materials and videos are

Motivation: 为了增强行星探测机器人的操作能力，需要理解其环境的地面力学特性。直接驱动、低传动比的腿部机器人具有通过腿部运动感知地形特性的潜力，可提供前所未有的采样速度和密度。

Method: 研究比较了两种步态：感知导向的Crawl N' Sense步态和运动导向的Trot-Walk步态。机器人在实验室横断面上运动，包括刚性表面、松散沙地和带合成表面结壳的松散沙地。

Result: 两种步态都能测量低阻力和高阻力基底之间的强度差异，但运动导向的小跑步态测量值幅度和方差更大。较慢的爬行步态检测表面结壳脆性破裂的准确性显著高于较快的小跑步态。

Abstract: In-situ robotic exploration is an important tool for advancing knowledge of
geological processes that describe the Earth and other Planetary bodies. To
inform and enhance operations for these roving laboratories, it is imperative
to understand the terramechanical properties of their environments, especially
for traversing on loose, deformable substrates. Recent research suggested that
legged robots with direct-drive and low-gear ratio actuators can sensitively
detect external forces, and therefore possess the potential to measure terrain
properties with their legs during locomotion, providing unprecedented sampling
speed and density while accessing terrains previously too risky to sample. This
paper explores these ideas by investigating the impact of gait on
proprioceptive terrain sensing accuracy, particularly comparing a
sensing-oriented gait, Crawl N' Sense, with a locomotion-oriented gait,
Trot-Walk. Each gait's ability to measure the strength and texture of
deformable substrate is quantified as the robot locomotes over a laboratory
transect consisting of a rigid surface, loose sand, and loose sand with
synthetic surface crusts. Our results suggest that with both the
sensing-oriented crawling gait and locomotion-oriented trot gait, the robot can
measure a consistent difference in the strength (in terms of penetration
resistance) between the low- and high-resistance substrates; however, the
locomotion-oriented trot gait contains larger magnitude and variance in
measurements. Furthermore, the slower crawl gait can detect brittle ruptures of
the surface crusts with significantly higher accuracy than the faster trot
gait. Our results offer new insights that inform legged robot "sensing during
locomotion" gait design and planning for scouting the terrain and producing
scientific measurements on other worlds to advance our understanding of their
geology and formation.

Conclusion: LLM提供的常识知识先验能有效解决物体级SLAM的稀疏观测问题，提高建图精度和实时性能。

Abstract: Object-level Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), which incorporates
semantic information for high-level scene understanding, faces challenges of
under-constrained optimization due to sparse observations. Prior work has
introduced additional constraints using commonsense knowledge, but obtaining
such priors has traditionally been labor-intensive and lacks generalizability
across diverse object categories. We address this limitation by leveraging
large language models (LLMs) to provide commonsense knowledge of object
geometric attributes, specifically size and orientation, as prior factors in a
graph-based SLAM framework. These priors are particularly beneficial during the
initial phase when object observations are limited. We implement a complete
pipeline integrating these priors, achieving robust data association on sparse
object-level features and enabling real-time object SLAM. Our system, evaluated
on the TUM RGB-D and 3RScan datasets, improves mapping accuracy by 36.8\% over
the latest baseline. Additionally, we present real-world experiments in the
supplementary video, demonstrating its real-time performance.

Motivation: 在多物体场景中稳定放置物体是机器人操作的基本挑战，现有方法依赖模拟引擎或基于外观的启发式评估，缺乏直接集成稳定性的方法。

Method: 使用离线采样规划器收集多模态放置标签，训练基于点云的扩散模型作为几何感知先验，利用基于分数的生成模型组合学习先验与稳定性感知损失。

Result: 在四个基准场景中，物理引导模型生成的放置位置对强力扰动的鲁棒性提高56%，运行时间比最先进的几何方法减少47%。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将稳定性直接集成到扩散模型采样过程中，显著提高了放置稳定性和计算效率，无需额外训练即可应用。

Abstract: Stably placing an object in a multi-object scene is a fundamental challenge
in robotic manipulation, as placements must be penetration-free, establish
precise surface contact, and result in a force equilibrium. To assess
stability, existing methods rely on running a simulation engine or resort to
heuristic, appearance-based assessments. In contrast, our approach integrates
stability directly into the sampling process of a diffusion model. To this end,
we query an offline sampling-based planner to gather multi-modal placement
labels and train a diffusion model to generate stable placements. The diffusion
model is conditioned on scene and object point clouds, and serves as a
geometry-aware prior. We leverage the compositional nature of score-based
generative models to combine this learned prior with a stability-aware loss,
thereby increasing the likelihood of sampling from regions of high stability.
Importantly, this strategy requires no additional re-training or fine-tuning,
and can be directly applied to off-the-shelf models. We evaluate our method on
four benchmark scenes where stability can be accurately computed. Our
physics-guided models achieve placements that are 56% more robust to forceful
perturbations while reducing runtime by 47% compared to a state-of-the-art
geometric method.

Conclusion: 该框架为人形机器人乒乓球提供了一条实用的端到端学习路径，学习预测器和预测奖励设计对性能至关重要。

Abstract: Humanoid table tennis (TT) demands rapid perception, proactive whole-body
motion, and agile footwork under strict timing -- capabilities that remain
difficult for unified controllers. We propose a reinforcement learning
framework that maps ball-position observations directly to whole-body joint
commands for both arm striking and leg locomotion, strengthened by predictive
signals and dense, physics-guided rewards. A lightweight learned predictor, fed
with recent ball positions, estimates future ball states and augments the
policy's observations for proactive decision-making. During training, a
physics-based predictor supplies precise future states to construct dense,
informative rewards that lead to effective exploration. The resulting policy
attains strong performance across varied serve ranges (hit rate $\geq$ 96% and
success rate $\geq$ 92%) in simulations. Ablation studies confirm that both the
learned predictor and the predictive reward design are critical for end-to-end
learning. Deployed zero-shot on a physical Booster T1 humanoid with 23 revolute
joints, the policy produces coordinated lateral and forward-backward footwork
with accurate, fast returns, suggesting a practical path toward versatile,
competitive humanoid TT.

Motivation: 解决现有方法面临的困境：模仿策略学习需要大量演示来覆盖任务变化，而模块化方法在动态场景中缺乏灵活性。

Method: 通过任务感知分解从单个人类示例中提取可重用技能，保留不变基元作为锚点，通过视觉语言基础动态调整可适应组件，利用语义解析和几何可行性约束解决场景模糊性。

Result: 实验验证：(1)相比模仿基线大幅减少演示需求；(2)通过原子技能拼接实现长时程任务的组合泛化；(3)对新颖但语义相似对象和外部干扰具有鲁棒性；(4)强大的跨具身迁移能力，无需重新训练即可在不同机器人平台上实例化技能。

Conclusion: 通过将人类先验与视觉语言锚定适应相结合，为在非结构化环境中实现实用且通用的双臂操作迈出了一步。

Abstract: Achieving generalizable bimanual manipulation requires systems that can learn
efficiently from minimal human input while adapting to real-world uncertainties
and diverse embodiments. Existing approaches face a dilemma: imitation policy
learning demands extensive demonstrations to cover task variations, while
modular methods often lack flexibility in dynamic scenes. We introduce VLBiMan,
a framework that derives reusable skills from a single human example through
task-aware decomposition, preserving invariant primitives as anchors while
dynamically adapting adjustable components via vision-language grounding. This
adaptation mechanism resolves scene ambiguities caused by background changes,
object repositioning, or visual clutter without policy retraining, leveraging
semantic parsing and geometric feasibility constraints. Moreover, the system
inherits human-like hybrid control capabilities, enabling mixed synchronous and
asynchronous use of both arms. Extensive experiments validate VLBiMan across
tool-use and multi-object tasks, demonstrating: (1) a drastic reduction in
demonstration requirements compared to imitation baselines, (2) compositional
generalization through atomic skill splicing for long-horizon tasks, (3)
robustness to novel but semantically similar objects and external disturbances,
and (4) strong cross-embodiment transfer, showing that skills learned from
human demonstrations can be instantiated on different robotic platforms without
retraining. By bridging human priors with vision-language anchored adaptation,
our work takes a step toward practical and versatile dual-arm manipulation in
unstructured settings.

Motivation: 人类社交互动中常见的游戏性欺骗在人机交互中研究不足，受土耳其冰淇淋商贩互动启发，探索有界、文化熟悉的欺骗形式如何影响用户信任、愉悦和参与度。

Method: 设计配备定制末端执行器的机器人操纵器，实现五种土耳其冰淇淋风格的欺骗策略，通过91名参与者的混合设计用户研究评估游戏性欺骗和互动时长对用户体验的影响。

Result: 土耳其冰淇淋式欺骗显著提升了愉悦感和参与度，但降低了感知安全性和信任，表明在多维度用户体验中存在结构化权衡。

Conclusion: 游戏性欺骗可作为娱乐和参与导向交互机器人的有价值设计策略，但需要审慎考虑其复杂的权衡关系。

Abstract: Playful deception, a common feature in human social interactions, remains
underexplored in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). Inspired by the Turkish Ice
Cream (TIC) vendor routine, we investigate how bounded, culturally familiar
forms of deception influence user trust, enjoyment, and engagement during
robotic handovers. We design a robotic manipulator equipped with a custom
end-effector and implement five TIC-inspired trick policies that deceptively
delay the handover of an ice cream-shaped object. Through a mixed-design user
study with 91 participants, we evaluate the effects of playful deception and
interaction duration on user experience. Results reveal that TIC-inspired
deception significantly enhances enjoyment and engagement, though reduces
perceived safety and trust, suggesting a structured trade-off across the
multi-dimensional aspects. Our findings demonstrate that playful deception can
be a valuable design strategy for interactive robots in entertainment and
engagement-focused contexts, while underscoring the importance of deliberate
consideration of its complex trade-offs. You can find more information,

Abstract: Despite growing interest in developing legged robots that emulate biological
locomotion for agile navigation of complex environments, acquiring a diverse
repertoire of skills remains a fundamental challenge in robotics. Existing
methods can learn motion behaviors from expert data, but they often fail to
acquire multiple locomotion skills through a single policy and lack smooth
skill transitions. We propose a multi-skill learning framework based on
Conditional Adversarial Motion Priors (CAMP), with the aim of enabling
quadruped robots to efficiently acquire a diverse set of locomotion skills from
expert demonstrations. Precise skill reconstruction is achieved through a novel
skill discriminator and skill-conditioned reward design. The overall framework
supports the active control and reuse of multiple skills, providing a practical
solution for learning generalizable policies in complex environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于轨迹分类的方法无法准确预测变道行为，除非包含整个场景信息。需要利用人类层次推理来建模车辆间的交互。

Method: 使用Level-k博弈论建模车辆间的交互，计算最理性的决策，作为先验或与传统运动分类模型结合。

Result: 该方法能够输出基于在线优化解决方案的最理性机动预测，提高预测准确性。

Conclusion: 结合博弈论的预测方法能够显著提升自适应巡航控制等决策系统的性能，进一步改善燃油经济性。

Abstract: Conventional maneuver prediction methods use some sort of classification
model on temporal trajectory data to predict behavior of agents over a set time
horizon. Despite of having the best precision and recall, these models cannot
predict a lane change accurately unless they incorporate information about the
entire scene. Level-k game theory can leverage the human-like hierarchical
reasoning to come up with the most rational decisions each agent can make in a
group. This can be leveraged to model interactions between different vehicles
in presence of each other and hence compute the most rational decisions each
agent would make. The result of game theoretic evaluation can be used as a
"prior" or combined with a traditional motion-based classification model to
achieve more accurate predictions. The proposed approach assumes that the
states of the vehicles around the target lead vehicle are known. The module
will output the most rational maneuver prediction of the target vehicle based
on an online optimization solution. These predictions are instrumental in
decision making systems like Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) or Traxen's
iQ-Cruise further improving the resulting fuel savings.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于蜗轮的自适应可变弹性(WAVE)执行器，通过蜗轮实现驱动电机与外部力的解耦，能够精确传递力并吸收位置差异，同时通过改变弹簧预压缩长度实现连续关节刚度调节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够同时调节柔性和刚度的机器人操纵器，以提高操作安全性和多功能性，特别是在接触密集型任务和挑战性环境中。

Method: 集成不可反向驱动的蜗轮，将驱动电机与外部力解耦；使用弹簧存储冲击能量；通过改变弹簧预压缩长度实现连续刚度调节。

Result: 实验验证了刚度模型，在静止状态下电机负载接近零（即使有外部载荷），成功展示了外部力的解耦；在WAVE操纵器应用中展示了保护特性。

Conclusion: WAVE执行器成功实现了外部力的解耦，其保护特性使得在接触密集型任务中能够延长操作时间，并适用于挑战性环境中的鲁棒机器人应用。

Abstract: Robotic manipulators capable of regulating both compliance and stiffness
offer enhanced operational safety and versatility. Here, we introduce Worm
Gear-based Adaptive Variable Elasticity (WAVE), a variable stiffness actuator
(VSA) that integrates a non-backdrivable worm gear. By decoupling the driving
motor from external forces using this gear, WAVE enables precise force
transmission to the joint, while absorbing positional discrepancies through
compliance. WAVE is protected from excessive loads by converting impact forces
into elastic energy stored in a spring. In addition, the actuator achieves
continuous joint stiffness modulation by changing the spring's precompression
length. We demonstrate these capabilities, experimentally validate the proposed
stiffness model, show that motor loads approach zero at rest--even under
external loading--and present applications using a manipulator with WAVE. This
outcome showcases the successful decoupling of external forces. The protective
attributes of this actuator allow for extended operation in contact-intensive
tasks, and for robust robotic applications in challenging environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长时程操作任务中的挑战，这些任务涉及扩展的动作序列和复杂的对象交互，需要在高级符号规划和低级连续控制之间建立桥梁。

Method: 使用语义场景图作为场景状态的结构化表示，包含基于场景图的任务规划器（使用VLM和LLM解析环境和推理场景状态转换序列）和解耦的结构化图像编辑管道（通过图像修复和合成将目标子目标图转换为对应图像）。

Result: 在多个不同的长时程任务上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SAGE框架通过语义场景图有效连接了任务级语义推理和像素级视觉运动控制，解决了长时程操作任务中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Successfully solving long-horizon manipulation tasks remains a fundamental
challenge. These tasks involve extended action sequences and complex object
interactions, presenting a critical gap between high-level symbolic planning
and low-level continuous control. To bridge this gap, two essential
capabilities are required: robust long-horizon task planning and effective
goal-conditioned manipulation. Existing task planning methods, including
traditional and LLM-based approaches, often exhibit limited generalization or
sparse semantic reasoning. Meanwhile, image-conditioned control methods
struggle to adapt to unseen tasks. To tackle these problems, we propose SAGE, a
novel framework for Scene Graph-Aware Guidance and Execution in Long-Horizon
Manipulation Tasks. SAGE utilizes semantic scene graphs as a structural
representation for scene states. A structural scene graph enables bridging
task-level semantic reasoning and pixel-level visuo-motor control. This also
facilitates the controllable synthesis of accurate, novel sub-goal images. SAGE
consists of two key components: (1) a scene graph-based task planner that uses
VLMs and LLMs to parse the environment and reason about physically-grounded
scene state transition sequences, and (2) a decoupled structural image editing
pipeline that controllably converts each target sub-goal graph into a
corresponding image through image inpainting and composition. Extensive
experiments have demonstrated that SAGE achieves state-of-the-art performance
on distinct long-horizon tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出可学习一致性预测(LCP)方法，用轻量级神经网络替代固定非一致性分数，生成上下文感知的不确定性集合，在保持理论保证的同时显著减小预测集大小并提高机器人任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在机器人应用中输出点估计且置信度校准不佳，无法量化新输入、噪声或分布外输入的预测可靠性。传统一致性预测依赖固定非一致性分数，忽略上下文信息，导致区间过于保守或不安全。

Method: LCP使用轻量级神经网络函数，利用几何、语义和任务特定特征生成上下文感知的不确定性集合，替代固定的非一致性分数。

Result: 在三个机器人任务的七个基准测试中，LCP持续优于标准CP和集成基线：分类任务预测集大小减少4.7-9.9%；目标检测边界框缩小46-54%；路径规划成功率从72%提升至91.5%，路径膨胀仅4.5%。

Conclusion: LCP是轻量级方法（4.8%运行时开销，42KB内存），支持在线适应，适合资源受限的自主系统，在保持理论保证的同时显著提升机器人任务性能。

Abstract: Deep learning models in robotics often output point estimates with poorly
calibrated confidences, offering no native mechanism to quantify predictive
reliability under novel, noisy, or out-of-distribution inputs. Conformal
prediction (CP) addresses this gap by providing distribution-free coverage
guarantees, yet its reliance on fixed nonconformity scores ignores context and
can yield intervals that are overly conservative or unsafe. We address this
with Learnable Conformal Prediction (LCP), which replaces fixed scores with a
lightweight neural function that leverages geometric, semantic, and
task-specific features to produce context-aware uncertainty sets.
  LCP maintains CP's theoretical guarantees while reducing prediction set sizes
by 18% in classification, tightening detection intervals by 52%, and improving
path planning safety from 72% to 91% success with minimal overhead. Across
three robotic tasks on seven benchmarks, LCP consistently outperforms Standard
CP and ensemble baselines. In classification on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, it
achieves smaller set sizes (4.7-9.9% reduction) at target coverage. For object
detection on COCO, BDD100K, and Cityscapes, it produces 46-54% tighter bounding
boxes. In path planning through cluttered environments, it improves success to
91.5% with only 4.5% path inflation, compared to 12.2% for Standard CP.
  The method is lightweight (approximately 4.8% runtime overhead, 42 KB memory)
and supports online adaptation, making it well suited to resource-constrained
autonomous systems. Hardware evaluation shows LCP adds less than 1% memory and
15.9% inference overhead, yet sustains 39 FPS on detection tasks while being
7.4 times more energy-efficient than ensembles.

TL;DR: FlowDrive是一种基于流匹配的轨迹规划器，通过条件修正流将噪声直接映射到轨迹分布，并引入适度引导来增加轨迹多样性，在处理长尾驾驶数据分布问题上取得了最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于学习的规划器对驾驶数据的长尾分布敏感，常见操作主导数据集，而危险或罕见场景稀疏，这种不平衡会使模型偏向频繁情况，降低关键场景的性能。

Method: 比较了训练数据采样的平衡策略，提出FlowDrive流匹配轨迹规划器，学习条件修正流以少步流匹配将噪声映射到轨迹分布，并引入适度闭环引导在流步骤间注入小扰动来系统增加轨迹多样性。

Result: 在nuPlan和interPlan基准测试中，FlowDrive在基于学习的规划器中达到最先进水平，接近基于规则优化的方法。添加适度引导和轻量后处理后，在几乎所有基准分割上都实现了整体最先进性能。

Conclusion: FlowDrive通过流匹配和适度引导有效解决了驾驶数据长尾分布问题，在轨迹规划任务中表现出色，为基于学习的规划器提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Learning-based planners are sensitive to the long-tailed distribution of
driving data. Common maneuvers dominate datasets, while dangerous or rare
scenarios are sparse. This imbalance can bias models toward the frequent cases
and degrade performance on critical scenarios. To tackle this problem, we
compare balancing strategies for sampling training data and find reweighting by
trajectory pattern an effective approach. We then present FlowDrive, a
flow-matching trajectory planner that learns a conditional rectified flow to
map noise directly to trajectory distributions with few flow-matching steps. We
further introduce moderated, in-the-loop guidance that injects small
perturbation between flow steps to systematically increase trajectory diversity
while remaining scene-consistent. On nuPlan and the interaction-focused
interPlan benchmarks, FlowDrive achieves state-of-the-art results among
learning-based planners and approaches methods with rule-based refinements.
After adding moderated guidance and light post-processing (FlowDrive*), it
achieves overall state-of-the-art performance across nearly all benchmark
splits.

Conclusion: 混合扩散过程为机器人长时域任务规划提供了更有效的解决方案，通过结合符号规划和连续轨迹生成提升了决策能力和灵活性。

Abstract: Constructing robots to accomplish long-horizon tasks is a long-standing
challenge within artificial intelligence. Approaches using generative methods,
particularly Diffusion Models, have gained attention due to their ability to
model continuous robotic trajectories for planning and control. However, we
show that these models struggle with long-horizon tasks that involve complex
decision-making and, in general, are prone to confusing different modes of
behavior, leading to failure. To remedy this, we propose to augment continuous
trajectory generation by simultaneously generating a high-level symbolic plan.
We show that this requires a novel mix of discrete variable diffusion and
continuous diffusion, which dramatically outperforms the baselines. In
addition, we illustrate how this hybrid diffusion process enables flexible
trajectory synthesis, allowing us to condition synthesized actions on partial
and complete symbolic conditions.

Motivation: 第一人称视频捕捉人类操作物体的方式，为学习物体操作提供多样化运动线索。相比昂贵的人工遥操作，第一人称视频提供了可扩展的替代方案，但现有方法依赖辅助标注，不清楚VLA能否直接从原始第一人称视频训练。

Method: 使用EgoScaler框架从四个大规模第一人称视频数据集中提取6DoF物体操作轨迹，自动精炼噪声或不完整轨迹，构建新的VLA预训练数据集，并在模拟和真实机器人环境中使用最先进的π₀架构进行实验。

Result: 预训练使任务成功率提升超过20%；性能与使用真实机器人数据集相当；将两者结合可获得进一步改进。

Conclusion: 第一人称视频是推进VLA研究的有前景且可扩展的资源。

Abstract: Egocentric videos capture how humans manipulate objects and tools, providing
diverse motion cues for learning object manipulation. Unlike the costly,
expert-driven manual teleoperation commonly used in training
Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs), egocentric videos offer a scalable
alternative. However, prior studies that leverage such videos for training
robot policies typically rely on auxiliary annotations, such as detailed
hand-pose recordings. Consequently, it remains unclear whether VLAs can be
trained directly from raw egocentric videos. In this work, we address this
challenge by leveraging EgoScaler, a framework that extracts 6DoF object
manipulation trajectories from egocentric videos without requiring auxiliary
recordings. We apply EgoScaler to four large-scale egocentric video datasets
and automatically refine noisy or incomplete trajectories, thereby constructing
a new large-scale dataset for VLA pre-training. Our experiments with a
state-of-the-art $\pi_0$ architecture in both simulated and real-robot
environments yield three key findings: (i) pre-training on our dataset improves
task success rates by over 20\% compared to training from scratch, (ii) the
performance is competitive with that achieved using real-robot datasets, and
(iii) combining our dataset with real-robot data yields further improvements.
These results demonstrate that egocentric videos constitute a promising and

TL;DR: 提出一种计算设计方法，用于创建单自由度过约束机器人肢体，能够在全周期旋转中实现能量高效、无自碰撞的空间轨迹运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然多自由度机器人肢体受自然启发，但单自由度设计具有简单性、鲁棒性、成本效益和效率等优势。过约束机构能够为1-DoF系统引入运动多样性，但通常受到全周期运动中自碰撞的限制。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了单自由度过约束机器人肢体的优化设计，能够在全周期运动中实现能量高效、无自碰撞的空间轨迹跟踪。

Abstract: While it is expected to build robotic limbs with multiple degrees of freedom
(DoF) inspired by nature, a single DoF design remains fundamental, providing
benefits that include, but are not limited to, simplicity, robustness,
cost-effectiveness, and efficiency. Mechanisms, especially those with multiple
links and revolute joints connected in closed loops, play an enabling factor in
introducing motion diversity for 1-DoF systems, which are usually constrained
by self-collision during a full-cycle range of motion. This study presents a
novel computational approach to designing one-degree-of-freedom (1-DoF)
overconstrained robotic limbs for a desired spatial trajectory, while achieving
energy-efficient, self-collision-free motion in full-cycle rotations. Firstly,
we present the geometric optimization problem of linkage-based robotic limbs in
a generalized formulation for self-collision-free design. Next, we formulate
the spatial trajectory generation problem with the overconstrained linkages by
optimizing the similarity and dynamic-related metrics. We further optimize the
geometric shape of the overconstrained linkage to ensure smooth and
collision-free motion driven by a single actuator. We validated our proposed
method through various experiments, including personalized automata and
bio-inspired hexapod robots. The resulting hexapod robot, featuring
overconstrained robotic limbs, demonstrated outstanding energy efficiency
during forward walking.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自适应ICP的LiDAR里程计方法，通过可靠的初始位姿和自适应阈值来提高动态环境下的点云配准精度


<details>

Motivation: 现有ICP方法未考虑初始位姿的可靠性，容易陷入局部最优，且缺乏自适应机制来处理复杂动态环境，导致配准精度下降

Method: 采用基于密度滤波的分布式粗配准获取初始位姿估计，通过与运动预测位姿比较选择可靠初始位姿，结合当前和历史误差动态调整自适应阈值，最后进行点对面自适应ICP配准

Result: 在KITTI数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法优于现有方法，显著提高了LiDAR里程计的精度

Conclusion: 提出的自适应ICP方法通过可靠的初始位姿和自适应阈值机制，有效解决了动态环境下的点云配准问题，提升了LiDAR里程计的精度和鲁棒性

Abstract: As a key technology for autonomous navigation and positioning in mobile
robots, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) odometry is widely used in
autonomous driving applications. The Iterative Closest Point (ICP)-based
methods have become the core technique in LiDAR odometry due to their efficient
and accurate point cloud registration capability. However, some existing
ICP-based methods do not consider the reliability of the initial pose, which
may cause the method to converge to a local optimum. Furthermore, the absence
of an adaptive mechanism hinders the effective handling of complex dynamic
environments, resulting in a significant degradation of registration accuracy.
To address these issues, this paper proposes an adaptive ICP-based LiDAR
odometry method that relies on a reliable initial pose. First, distributed
coarse registration based on density filtering is employed to obtain the
initial pose estimation. The reliable initial pose is then selected by
comparing it with the motion prediction pose, reducing the initial error
between the source and target point clouds. Subsequently, by combining the
current and historical errors, the adaptive threshold is dynamically adjusted
to accommodate the real-time changes in the dynamic environment. Finally, based
on the reliable initial pose and the adaptive threshold, point-to-plane
adaptive ICP registration is performed from the current frame to the local map,
achieving high-precision alignment of the source and target point clouds.
Extensive experiments on the public KITTI dataset demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms existing approaches and significantly enhances the accuracy
of LiDAR odometry.

TL;DR: 提出ADP框架，通过动作感知的动态剪枝机制，在机器人操作的不同阶段自适应调整视觉token保留比例，显著降低计算成本的同时保持操作性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在优化VLA模型推理速度时，忽视了机器人操作不同阶段的视觉冗余度差异。研究发现粗粒度操作阶段的视觉token冗余度高于精细操作阶段，且与动作动态性密切相关。

Method: 提出动作感知动态剪枝(ADP)框架，结合文本驱动的token选择和动作感知轨迹门控机制。通过基于近期动作轨迹的门控信号，自适应调整token保留比例。

Result: 在LIBERO套件和多种真实场景实验中，显著降低了FLOPs和动作推理延迟（如OpenVLA-OFT上1.35倍加速），同时保持竞争力的成功率（如OpenVLA上提升25.8%）。

Conclusion: ADP为高效机器人策略提供了简单插件路径，推进了机器人操作在效率和性能方面的前沿发展。

Abstract: Robotic manipulation with Vision-Language-Action models requires efficient
inference over long-horizon multi-modal context, where attention to dense
visual tokens dominates computational cost. Existing methods optimize inference
speed by reducing visual redundancy within VLA models, but they overlook the
varying redundancy across robotic manipulation stages. We observe that the
visual token redundancy is higher in coarse manipulation phase than in
fine-grained operations, and is strongly correlated with the action dynamic.
Motivated by this observation, we propose \textbf{A}ction-aware
\textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{P}runing (\textbf{ADP}), a multi-modal pruning
framework that integrates text-driven token selection with action-aware
trajectory gating. Our method introduces a gating mechanism that conditions the
pruning signal on recent action trajectories, using past motion windows to
adaptively adjust token retention ratios in accordance with dynamics, thereby
balancing computational efficiency and perceptual precision across different
manipulation stages. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO suites and diverse
real-world scenarios demonstrate that our method significantly reduces FLOPs
and action inference latency (\textit{e.g.} $1.35 \times$ speed up on
OpenVLA-OFT) while maintaining competitive success rates (\textit{e.g.} 25.8\%
improvements with OpenVLA) compared to baselines, thereby providing a simple
plug-in path to efficient robot policies that advances the efficiency and
performance frontier of robotic manipulation. Our project website is:

TL;DR: 开发基于LLM的Furhat对话机器人，通过游戏化方式帮助有语言障碍的学龄前儿童改善语言表达能力，特别是形态结构的学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 帮助有语言障碍（如发育性语言障碍或移民相关语言挑战）的学龄前儿童改善表达性语言技能，减轻治疗师和教育工作者的负担。

Method: 使用Furhat对话机器人结合大型语言模型(LLM)玩单词检索游戏"Alias"，管理游戏流程、对话、情感响应和轮转，并计划生成特定形态目标结构。

Result: 目前开发了基于LLM的应用程序原型，能够管理游戏流程和基本互动，下一步将扩展LLM能力以生成特定形态目标。

Conclusion: 机器人可能在此任务上优于人类，长期目标是创建强大的基于LLM的机器人辅助语言学习干预系统，能够跨语言教授多种形态结构。

Abstract: Preschool children with language vulnerabilities -- such as developmental
language disorders or immigration related language challenges -- often require
support to strengthen their expressive language skills. Based on the principle
of implicit learning, speech-language therapists (SLTs) typically embed target
morphological structures (e.g., third person -s) into everyday interactions or
game-based learning activities. Educators are recommended by SLTs to do the
same. This approach demands precise linguistic knowledge and real-time
production of various morphological forms (e.g., "Daddy wears these when he
drives to work"). The task becomes even more demanding when educators or parent
also must keep children engaged and manage turn-taking in a game-based
activity. In the TalBot project our multiprofessional team have developed an
application in which the Furhat conversational robot plays the word retrieval
game "Alias" with children to improve language skills. Our application
currently employs a large language model (LLM) to manage gameplay, dialogue,
affective responses, and turn-taking. Our next step is to further leverage the
capacity of LLMs so the robot can generate and deliver specific morphological
targets during the game. We hypothesize that a robot could outperform humans at
this task. Novel aspects of this approach are that the robot could ultimately
serve as a model and tutor for both children and professionals and that using
LLM capabilities in this context would support basic communication needs for
children with language vulnerabilities. Our long-term goal is to create a
robust LLM-based Robot-Assisted Language Learning intervention capable of
teaching a variety of morphological structures across different languages.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种鲁棒非线性模型预测控制方法（多阶段NMPC），用于控制二自由度外骨骼机器人，通过解决非线性优化问题来处理系统不确定性，显著降低了人机交互力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于肌肉骨骼损伤增加，外骨骼机器人的使用日益增多，但其有效性严重依赖于控制系统设计。现有线性化方法在非线性机器人动力学中性能下降，需要更鲁棒的控制策略。

Method: 采用多阶段非线性模型预测控制（RNMPC），通过多个场景表示系统不确定性，专注于在摆动阶段最小化人机交互力，特别是在机器人承载未知负载时。

Result: 仿真和实验测试表明，该方法显著提高了鲁棒性，优于非鲁棒NMPC。在2kg未知负载和外部扰动下，多阶段NMPC的大腿和小腿交互力RMS值分别比非鲁棒NMPC降低了77%和94%。

Conclusion: 多阶段NMPC方法能有效处理外骨骼机器人中的不确定性，显著降低跟踪误差和交互力，为外骨骼控制提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: The use of exoskeleton robots is increasing due to the rising number of
musculoskeletal injuries. However, their effectiveness depends heavily on the
design of control systems. Designing robust controllers is challenging because
of uncertainties in human-robot systems. Among various control strategies,
Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a powerful approach due to its ability to
handle constraints and optimize performance. Previous studies have used
linearization-based methods to implement robust MPC on exoskeletons, but these
can degrade performance due to nonlinearities in the robot's dynamics. To
address this gap, this paper proposes a Robust Nonlinear Model Predictive
Control (RNMPC) method, called multi-stage NMPC, to control a
two-degree-of-freedom exoskeleton by solving a nonlinear optimization problem.
This method uses multiple scenarios to represent system uncertainties. The
study focuses on minimizing human-robot interaction forces during the swing
phase, particularly when the robot carries unknown loads. Simulations and
experimental tests show that the proposed method significantly improves
robustness, outperforming non-robust NMPC. It achieves lower tracking errors
and interaction forces under various uncertainties. For instance, when a 2 kg
unknown payload is combined with external disturbances, the RMS values of thigh
and shank interaction forces for multi-stage NMPC are reduced by 77 and 94
percent, respectively, compared to non-robust NMPC.

Conclusion: DemoGrasp展示了强大的泛化能力，能够适应空间、背景和光照变化，支持RGB和深度输入，并可扩展到语言引导的杂乱场景抓取。

Abstract: Universal grasping with multi-fingered dexterous hands is a fundamental
challenge in robotic manipulation. While recent approaches successfully learn
closed-loop grasping policies using reinforcement learning (RL), the inherent
difficulty of high-dimensional, long-horizon exploration necessitates complex
reward and curriculum design, often resulting in suboptimal solutions across
diverse objects. We propose DemoGrasp, a simple yet effective method for
learning universal dexterous grasping. We start from a single successful
demonstration trajectory of grasping a specific object and adapt to novel
objects and poses by editing the robot actions in this trajectory: changing the
wrist pose determines where to grasp, and changing the hand joint angles
determines how to grasp. We formulate this trajectory editing as a single-step
Markov Decision Process (MDP) and use RL to optimize a universal policy across
hundreds of objects in parallel in simulation, with a simple reward consisting
of a binary success term and a robot-table collision penalty. In simulation,
DemoGrasp achieves a 95% success rate on DexGraspNet objects using the Shadow
Hand, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods. It also shows strong
transferability, achieving an average success rate of 84.6% across diverse
dexterous hand embodiments on six unseen object datasets, while being trained
on only 175 objects. Through vision-based imitation learning, our policy
successfully grasps 110 unseen real-world objects, including small, thin items.
It generalizes to spatial, background, and lighting changes, supports both RGB
and depth inputs, and extends to language-guided grasping in cluttered scenes.

Abstract: Learning to generate dual-hand grasps that respect object semantics is
essential for robust hand-object interaction but remains largely underexplored
due to dataset scarcity. Existing grasp datasets predominantly focus on
single-hand interactions and contain only limited semantic part annotations. To
address these challenges, we introduce a pipeline, SymOpt, that constructs a
large-scale dual-hand grasp dataset by leveraging existing single-hand datasets
and exploiting object and hand symmetries. Building on this, we propose a
text-guided dual-hand grasp generator, DHAGrasp, that synthesizes Dual-Hand
Affordance-aware Grasps for unseen objects. Our approach incorporates a novel
dual-hand affordance representation and follows a two-stage design, which
enables effective learning from a small set of segmented training objects while
scaling to a much larger pool of unsegmented data. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method produces diverse and semantically consistent
grasps, outperforming strong baselines in both grasp quality and generalization
to unseen objects. The project page is at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VLM2VLA是一种新的视觉语言动作模型训练范式，通过用自然语言表示低级动作来解决数据分布不匹配问题，使用LoRA微调避免灾难性遗忘，保持VLM的核心推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在机器人遥操作数据上微调视觉语言模型时会导致灾难性遗忘，削弱模型的推理和多模态理解能力，阻碍泛化到新场景和语义理解。

Method: 使用自然语言表示低级动作来对齐数据分布，仅使用低秩适应(LoRA)进行微调，最小化对VLM骨干网络的修改。

Result: 通过广泛的视觉问答研究和800多次真实机器人实验，证明VLM2VLA能保持VLM核心能力，实现零样本泛化到需要开放世界语义推理和多语言指令跟随的新任务。

Conclusion: VLM2VLA通过数据级对齐和LoRA微调，解决了VLA训练中的灾难性遗忘问题，为训练通用策略提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) on robot teleoperation data to
create vision-language-action (VLA) models is a promising paradigm for training
generalist policies, but it suffers from a fundamental tradeoff: learning to
produce actions often diminishes the VLM's foundational reasoning and
multimodal understanding, hindering generalization to novel scenarios,
instruction following, and semantic understanding. We argue that this
catastrophic forgetting is due to a distribution mismatch between the VLM's
internet-scale pretraining corpus and the robotics fine-tuning data. Inspired
by this observation, we introduce VLM2VLA: a VLA training paradigm that first
resolves this mismatch at the data level by representing low-level actions with
natural language. This alignment makes it possible to train VLAs solely with
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), thereby minimally modifying the VLM backbone and
averting catastrophic forgetting. As a result, the VLM can be fine-tuned on
robot teleoperation data without fundamentally altering the underlying
architecture and without expensive co-training on internet-scale VLM datasets.
Through extensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) studies and over 800
real-world robotics experiments, we demonstrate that VLM2VLA preserves the
VLM's core capabilities, enabling zero-shot generalization to novel tasks that
require open-world semantic reasoning and multilingual instruction following.

Conclusion: 该方法有效弥合了人类视频与机器人视频之间的域差距，通过扩展人类数据训练显著提升了VLA模型的性能。

Abstract: Vision Language Action (VLA) models derive their generalization capability
from diverse training data, yet collecting embodied robot interaction data
remains prohibitively expensive. In contrast, human demonstration videos are
far more scalable and cost-efficient to collect, and recent studies confirm
their effectiveness in training VLA models. However, a significant domain gap
persists between human videos and robot-executed videos, including unstable
camera viewpoints, visual discrepancies between human hands and robotic arms,
and differences in motion dynamics. To bridge this gap, we propose
MimicDreamer, a framework that turns fast, low-cost human demonstrations into
robot-usable supervision by jointly aligning vision, viewpoint, and actions to
directly support policy training. For visual alignment, we propose H2R Aligner,
a video diffusion model that generates high-fidelity robot demonstration videos
by transferring motion from human manipulation footage. For viewpoint
stabilization, EgoStabilizer is proposed, which canonicalizes egocentric videos
via homography and inpaints occlusions and distortions caused by warping. For
action alignment, we map human hand trajectories to the robot frame and apply a
constrained inverse kinematics solver to produce feasible, low-jitter joint
commands with accurate pose tracking. Empirically, VLA models trained purely on
our synthesized human-to-robot videos achieve few-shot execution on real
robots. Moreover, scaling training with human data significantly boosts
performance compared to models trained solely on real robot data; our approach
improves the average success rate by 14.7\% across six representative
manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: 将视频驱动的意图解析与前瞻性动态建模相结合，是开发通用机器人系统的高度有效策略。

Abstract: Generalizing to long-horizon manipulation tasks in a zero-shot setting
remains a central challenge in robotics. Current multimodal foundation based
approaches, despite their capabilities, typically fail to decompose high-level
commands into executable action sequences from static visual input alone. To
address this challenge, we introduce Super-Mimic, a hierarchical framework that
enables zero-shot robotic imitation by directly inferring procedural intent
from unscripted human demonstration videos. Our framework is composed of two
sequential modules. First, a Human Intent Translator (HIT) parses the input
video using multimodal reasoning to produce a sequence of language-grounded
subtasks. These subtasks then condition a Future Dynamics Predictor (FDP),
which employs a generative model that synthesizes a physically plausible video
rollout for each step. The resulting visual trajectories are dynamics-aware,
explicitly modeling crucial object interactions and contact points to guide the
low-level controller. We validate this approach through extensive experiments
on a suite of long-horizon manipulation tasks, where Super-Mimic significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot methods by over 20\%. These results
establish that coupling video-driven intent parsing with prospective dynamics
modeling is a highly effective strategy for developing general-purpose robotic
systems.

Conclusion: 提出的IMU预积分雷达因子方法有效降低了计算成本，在资源受限硬件上实现了实时性能，同时保持了定位精度。

Abstract: Fixed-lag Radar-LiDAR-Inertial smoothers conventionally create one factor
graph node per measurement to compensate for the lack of time synchronization
between radar and LiDAR. For a radar-LiDAR sensor pair with equal rates, this
strategy results in a state creation rate of twice the individual sensor
frequencies. This doubling of the number of states per second yields high
optimization costs, inhibiting real-time performance on resource-constrained
hardware. We introduce IMU-preintegrated radar factors that use high-rate
inertial data to propagate the most recent LiDAR state to the radar measurement
timestamp. This strategy maintains the node creation rate at the LiDAR
measurement frequency. Assuming equal sensor rates, this lowers the number of
nodes by 50 % and consequently the computational costs. Experiments on a single
board computer (which has 4 cores each of 2.2 GHz A73 and 2 GHz A53 with 8 GB
RAM) show that our method preserves the absolute pose error of a conventional
baseline while simultaneously lowering the aggregated factor graph optimization
time by up to 56 %.

Abstract: Hospital patient falls remain a critical and costly challenge worldwide.
While conventional fall prevention systems typically rely on post-fall
detection or reactive alerts, they also often suffer from high false positive
rates and fail to address the underlying patient needs that lead to bed-exit
attempts. This paper presents a novel system architecture that leverages the
Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT) to orchestrate human-robot-robot interaction
for proactive and personalized patient assistance. The system integrates a
privacy-preserving thermal sensing model capable of real-time bed-exit
prediction, with two coordinated robotic agents that respond dynamically based
on predicted intent and patient input. This orchestrated response could not
only reduce fall risk but also attend to the patient's underlying motivations
for movement, such as thirst, discomfort, or the need for assistance, before a
hazardous situation arises. Our contributions with this pilot study are
three-fold: (1) a modular IoRT-based framework enabling distributed sensing,
prediction, and multi-robot coordination; (2) a demonstration of low-resolution
thermal sensing for accurate, privacy-preserving preemptive bed-exit detection;
and (3) results from a user study and systematic error analysis that inform the
design of situationally aware, multi-agent interactions in hospital settings.
The findings highlight how interactive and connected robotic systems can move
beyond passive monitoring to deliver timely, meaningful assistance, empowering
safer, more responsive care environments.

Result: 所有代理都表现出显著的视觉偏见，其中相机视角是最关键因素；代理在高度饱和颜色上获得最高成功率，表明从底层VLM继承了视觉偏好；视觉偏见表现出强烈的不对称耦合，视角强烈放大了颜色相关偏见。

Conclusion: 系统分析视觉偏见是开发安全可靠通用具身代理的前提条件，基于语义接地层的缓解策略可显著减少视觉偏见。

Abstract: The safety and reliability of embodied agents rely on accurate and unbiased
visual perception. However, existing benchmarks mainly emphasize generalization
and robustness under perturbations, while systematic quantification of visual
bias remains scarce. This gap limits a deeper understanding of how perception
influences decision-making stability. To address this issue, we propose
RoboView-Bias, the first benchmark specifically designed to systematically
quantify visual bias in robotic manipulation, following a principle of factor
isolation. Leveraging a structured variant-generation framework and a
perceptual-fairness validation protocol, we create 2,127 task instances that
enable robust measurement of biases induced by individual visual factors and
their interactions. Using this benchmark, we systematically evaluate three
representative embodied agents across two prevailing paradigms and report three
key findings: (i) all agents exhibit significant visual biases, with camera
viewpoint being the most critical factor; (ii) agents achieve their highest
success rates on highly saturated colors, indicating inherited visual
preferences from underlying VLMs; and (iii) visual biases show strong,
asymmetric coupling, with viewpoint strongly amplifying color-related bias.
Finally, we demonstrate that a mitigation strategy based on a semantic
grounding layer substantially reduces visual bias by approximately 54.5\% on
MOKA. Our results highlight that systematic analysis of visual bias is a
prerequisite for developing safe and reliable general-purpose embodied agents.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出基于学习的触觉反应多智能体模型预测控制器，用于抓取不同软硬度和形状的物体，超越现有单智能体系统的能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前抓取系统主要针对刚性物体，处理易碎或可变形材料时性能显著下降；单智能体触觉反应抓取无法处理大型重物

Method: 使用两个Gelsight Mini触觉传感器提取实时纹理和刚度信息，通过触觉反馈估计接触动力学和物体柔顺性，采用多智能体MPC框架进行协作控制

Result: 在实现和维持不同大小和刚度物体的稳定抓取方面，该方法在成功率上优于独立的PD和MPC基线方法

Conclusion: 结合触觉传感和学习型多智能体MPC，为复杂环境中的协作抓取提供了鲁棒智能解决方案，显著提升了多智能体系统的能力

Abstract: Grasping is a core task in robotics with various applications. However, most
current implementations are primarily designed for rigid items, and their
performance drops considerably when handling fragile or deformable materials
that require real-time feedback. Meanwhile, tactile-reactive grasping focuses
on a single agent, which limits their ability to grasp and manipulate large,
heavy objects. To overcome this, we propose a learning-based, tactile-reactive
multi-agent Model Predictive Controller (MPC) for grasping a wide range of
objects with different softness and shapes, beyond the capabilities of
preexisting single-agent implementations. Our system uses two Gelsight Mini
tactile sensors [1] to extract real-time information on object texture and
stiffness. This rich tactile feedback is used to estimate contact dynamics and
object compliance in real time, enabling the system to adapt its control policy
to diverse object geometries and stiffness profiles. The learned controller
operates in a closed loop, leveraging tactile encoding to predict grasp
stability and adjust force and position accordingly. Our key technical
contributions include a multi-agent MPC formulation trained on real contact
interactions, a tactile-data driven method for inferring grasping states, and a
coordination strategy that enables collaborative control. By combining tactile
sensing and a learning-based multi-agent MPC, our method offers a robust,
intelligent solution for collaborative grasping in complex environments,
significantly advancing the capabilities of multi-agent systems. Our approach
is validated through extensive experiments against independent PD and MPC
baselines. Our pipeline outperforms the baselines regarding success rates in
achieving and maintaining stable grasps across objects of varying sizes and
stiffness.

TL;DR: 提出了OntoBOT本体论，统一表示任务、动作、环境和机器人能力，支持服务机器人的形式化推理和知识共享。


<details>

Motivation: 现有服务机器人解决方案通常与特定平台紧密耦合，限制了互操作性、可重用性和知识共享。现有本体论如SOMA和DOLCE专注于特定领域，未能充分捕捉环境、动作、机器人能力和系统集成之间的连接。

Method: 扩展现有本体论，提出OntoBOT本体论，提供任务、动作、环境和能力的统一表示。通过评估四个具体代理（TIAGo、HSR、UR3、Stretch）的能力问题来验证其通用性。

Result: OntoBOT支持上下文感知推理、面向任务的执行和服务机器人领域的知识共享，展示了跨不同机器人平台的通用性。

Conclusion: OntoBOT为服务机器人提供了一个统一的本体论框架，能够促进任务执行的形式化推理和跨平台知识共享。

Abstract: Personal service robots are increasingly used in domestic settings to assist
older adults and people requiring support. Effective operation involves not
only physical interaction but also the ability to interpret dynamic
environments, understand tasks, and choose appropriate actions based on
context. This requires integrating both hardware components (e.g. sensors,
actuators) and software systems capable of reasoning about tasks, environments,
and robot capabilities. Frameworks such as the Robot Operating System (ROS)
provide open-source tools that help connect low-level hardware with
higher-level functionalities. However, real-world deployments remain tightly
coupled to specific platforms. As a result, solutions are often isolated and
hard-coded, limiting interoperability, reusability, and knowledge sharing.
Ontologies and knowledge graphs offer a structured way to represent tasks,
environments, and robot capabilities. Existing ontologies, such as the
Socio-physical Model of Activities (SOMA) and the Descriptive Ontology for
Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering (DOLCE), provide models for activities,
spatial relationships, and reasoning structures. However, they often focus on
specific domains and do not fully capture the connection between environment,
action, robot capabilities, and system-level integration. In this work, we
propose the Ontology for roBOts and acTions (OntoBOT), which extends existing
ontologies to provide a unified representation of tasks, actions, environments,
and capabilities. Our contributions are twofold: (1) we unify these aspects
into a cohesive ontology to support formal reasoning about task execution, and
(2) we demonstrate its generalizability by evaluating competency questions
across four embodied agents - TIAGo, HSR, UR3, and Stretch - showing how
OntoBOT enables context-aware reasoning, task-oriented execution, and knowledge
sharing in service robotics.

Motivation: 解决水下作业面临的流体扰动、通信带宽受限和浑浊水域感知退化等挑战

Conclusion: 通过减少对水下特定训练数据的依赖并提高跨环境适应性，为下一代智能自主水下航行器提供了可扩展且经济高效的路径

Abstract: This paper presents UnderwaterVLA, a novel framework for autonomous
underwater navigation that integrates multimodal foundation models with
embodied intelligence systems. Underwater operations remain difficult due to
hydrodynamic disturbances, limited communication bandwidth, and degraded
sensing in turbid waters. To address these challenges, we introduce three
innovations. First, a dual-brain architecture decouples high-level mission
reasoning from low-level reactive control, enabling robust operation under
communication and computational constraints. Second, we apply
Vision-Language-Action(VLA) models to underwater robotics for the first time,
incorporating structured chain-of-thought reasoning for interpretable
decision-making. Third, a hydrodynamics-informed Model Predictive Control(MPC)
scheme compensates for fluid effects in real time without costly task-specific
training. Experimental results in field tests show that UnderwaterVLA reduces
navigation errors in degraded visual conditions while maintaining higher task
completion by 19% to 27% over baseline. By minimizing reliance on
underwater-specific training data and improving adaptability across
environments, UnderwaterVLA provides a scalable and cost-effective path toward
the next generation of intelligent AUVs.

Abstract: This paper proposes a task allocation algorithm for teams of heterogeneous
robots in environments with uncertain task requirements. We model these
requirements as probability distributions over capabilities and use this model
to allocate tasks such that robots with complementary skills naturally position
near uncertain tasks, proactively mitigating task failures without wasting
resources. We introduce a market-based approach that optimizes the joint team
objective while explicitly capturing coupled rewards between robots, offering a
polynomial-time solution in decentralized settings with strict communication
assumptions. Comparative experiments against benchmark algorithms demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach and highlight the challenges of incorporating
coupled rewards in a decentralized formulation.

Abstract: Mutual understanding of artificial agents' decisions is key to ensuring a
trustworthy and successful human-robot interaction. Hence, robots are expected
to make reasonable decisions and communicate them to humans when needed. In
this article, the focus is on an approach to modeling and reasoning about the
comparison of two competing plans, so that robots can later explain the
divergent result. First, a novel ontological model is proposed to formalize and
reason about the differences between competing plans, enabling the
classification of the most appropriate one (e.g., the shortest, the safest, the
closest to human preferences, etc.). This work also investigates the
limitations of a baseline algorithm for ontology-based explanatory narration.
To address these limitations, a novel algorithm is presented, leveraging
divergent knowledge between plans and facilitating the construction of
contrastive narratives. Through empirical evaluation, it is observed that the
explanations excel beyond the baseline method.

Motivation: 解决在部分观测场景中执行语言指定移动操作任务时面临的挑战：与部分观测场景交互、将语言指令中的语义信息接地到部分观测场景、以及主动更新场景知识。

Method: 构建包含导航相关语义和占据信息的2D地图，同时主动构建任务相关对象的3D高斯表示，在多层次表示中融合观测，显式建模每个对象检测的多视角一致性，并制定平衡未观测区域探索和场景语义信息利用的目标函数。

Result: 在Habitat模拟器的OVMM基准测试中达到最先进结果，由于是零样本方法，HELIOS还能在不需额外数据的情况下迁移到真实世界，在Spot机器人上成功演示。

Conclusion: HELIOS通过分层场景表示和平衡探索与利用的搜索目标，有效解决了语言指定移动操作任务中的感知挑战，在复杂大场景中表现出色且具有零样本迁移能力。

Abstract: Language-specified mobile manipulation tasks in novel environments
simultaneously face challenges interacting with a scene which is only partially
observed, grounding semantic information from language instructions to the
partially observed scene, and actively updating knowledge of the scene with new
observations. To address these challenges, we propose HELIOS, a hierarchical
scene representation and associated search objective to perform language
specified pick and place mobile manipulation tasks. We construct 2D maps
containing the relevant semantic and occupancy information for navigation while
simultaneously actively constructing 3D Gaussian representations of
task-relevant objects. We fuse observations across this multi-layered
representation while explicitly modeling the multi-view consistency of the
detections of each object. In order to efficiently search for the target
object, we formulate an objective function balancing exploration of unobserved
or uncertain regions with exploitation of scene semantic information. We
evaluate HELIOS on the OVMM benchmark in the Habitat simulator, a pick and
place benchmark in which perception is challenging due to large and complex
scenes with comparatively small target objects. HELIOS achieves
state-of-the-art results on OVMM. As our approach is zero-shot, HELIOS can also
transfer to the real world without requiring additional data, as we illustrate
by demonstrating it in a real world office environment on a Spot robot.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自动驾驶车辆与人类驾驶车辆混合的交通环境中，不可预测的意图和异质行为使得安全高效的车道变换极具挑战性。现有方法往往过度简化这些交互，假设统一模式。

Method: 使用在NGSIM数据集上训练的深度学习分类器实时识别人类驾驶风格；通过包含内在和交互组件的合作评分估计周围驾驶员的意图和合作意愿；结合行为克隆和逆强化学习进行决策；集成模型预测控制和IRL意图推理生成轨迹。

Conclusion: 结果表明建模驾驶员异质性的好处，并展示了该框架在复杂交通环境中推进情境感知和类人自动驾驶的潜力。

Abstract: In mixed-traffic environments, where autonomous vehicles (AVs) interact with
diverse human-driven vehicles (HVs), unpredictable intentions and heterogeneous
behaviors make safe and efficient lane change maneuvers highly challenging.
Existing methods often oversimplify these interactions by assuming uniform
patterns. We propose an intention-driven lane change framework that integrates
driving-style recognition, cooperation-aware decision-making, and coordinated
motion planning. A deep learning classifier trained on the NGSIM dataset
identifies human driving styles in real time. A cooperation score with
intrinsic and interactive components estimates surrounding drivers' intentions
and quantifies their willingness to cooperate with the ego vehicle.
Decision-making combines behavior cloning with inverse reinforcement learning
to determine whether a lane change should be initiated. For trajectory
generation, model predictive control is integrated with IRL-based intention
inference to produce collision-free and socially compliant maneuvers.
Experiments show that the proposed model achieves 94.2\% accuracy and 94.3\%
F1-score, outperforming rule-based and learning-based baselines by 4-15\% in
lane change recognition. These results highlight the benefit of modeling
inter-driver heterogeneity and demonstrate the potential of the framework to
advance context-aware and human-like autonomous driving in complex traffic
environments.

Motivation: 现有方法大多依赖多模态输入（如RGB-D），需要处理时间序列窗口数据。为了实现更快的机器人响应和更好的服务质量，需要开发仅使用RGB输入且能进行帧级精度预测的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在人类交互意图预测方面实现了最先进的性能，并发布了新的帧级标注数据集以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Efficiently detecting human intent to interact with ubiquitous robots is
crucial for effective human-robot interaction (HRI) and collaboration. Over the
past decade, deep learning has gained traction in this field, with most
existing approaches relying on multimodal inputs, such as RGB combined with
depth (RGB-D), to classify time-sequence windows of sensory data as interactive
or non-interactive. In contrast, we propose a novel RGB-only pipeline for
predicting human interaction intent with frame-level precision, enabling faster
robot responses and improved service quality. A key challenge in intent
prediction is the class imbalance inherent in real-world HRI datasets, which
can hinder the model's training and generalization. To address this, we
introduce MINT-RVAE, a synthetic sequence generation method, along with new
loss functions and training strategies that enhance generalization on
out-of-sample data. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance (AUROC:
0.95) outperforming prior works (AUROC: 0.90-0.912), while requiring only RGB
input and supporting precise frame onset prediction. Finally, to support future
research, we openly release our new dataset with frame-level labeling of human
interaction intent.

Motivation: 模仿学习策略在机器人操作中表现良好，但在单一自我中心视角训练下，当视角发生变化时性能会显著下降。

Method: 提出EgoDemoGen框架，包含EgoViewTransfer生成视频修复模型，通过重新定位动作到新视角并合成对应的自我中心观察视频，使用自监督双重重投影策略微调预训练视频生成模型。

Conclusion: EgoDemoGen为自我中心视角鲁棒的机器人操作提供了一条实用路径。

Abstract: Imitation learning based policies perform well in robotic manipulation, but
they often degrade under *egocentric viewpoint shifts* when trained from a
single egocentric viewpoint. To address this issue, we present **EgoDemoGen**,
a framework that generates *paired* novel egocentric demonstrations by
retargeting actions in the novel egocentric frame and synthesizing the
corresponding egocentric observation videos with proposed generative video
repair model **EgoViewTransfer**, which is conditioned by a novel-viewpoint
reprojected scene video and a robot-only video rendered from the retargeted
joint actions. EgoViewTransfer is finetuned from a pretrained video generation
model using self-supervised double reprojection strategy. We evaluate
EgoDemoGen on both simulation (RoboTwin2.0) and real-world robot. After
training with a mixture of EgoDemoGen-generated novel egocentric demonstrations
and original standard egocentric demonstrations, policy success rate improves
**absolutely** by **+17.0%** for standard egocentric viewpoint and by
**+17.7%** for novel egocentric viewpoints in simulation. On real-world robot,
the **absolute** improvements are **+18.3%** and **+25.8%**. Moreover,
performance continues to improve as the proportion of EgoDemoGen-generated
demonstrations increases, with diminishing returns. These results demonstrate
that EgoDemoGen provides a practical route to egocentric viewpoint-robust
robotic manipulation.

Motivation: 人类通过主动交互发展物理直觉，而现有视频模型（如Sora）依赖被动观察，难以理解物理因果关系。假设真实物理直觉必须基于大量因果丰富的真实世界交互。

Method: 构建14B参数的WoW生成世界模型，在200万机器人交互轨迹上训练。使用SOPHIA系统（视觉语言模型代理）评估DiT生成输出，通过迭代演化语言指令来约束物理真实性。联合训练逆动力学模型将精炼计划转换为可执行机器人动作。

Result: 模型对物理的理解是可能结果的概率分布，会出现随机不稳定性和物理幻觉。在WoWBench基准测试中取得最先进性能，在物理因果关系、碰撞动力学和物体持久性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 大规模真实世界交互是发展AI物理直觉的基石。模型、数据和基准将开源。

Abstract: Humans develop an understanding of intuitive physics through active
interaction with the world. This approach is in stark contrast to current video
models, such as Sora, which rely on passive observation and therefore struggle
with grasping physical causality. This observation leads to our central
hypothesis: authentic physical intuition of the world model must be grounded in
extensive, causally rich interactions with the real world. To test this
hypothesis, we present WoW, a 14-billion-parameter generative world model
trained on 2 million robot interaction trajectories. Our findings reveal that
the model's understanding of physics is a probabilistic distribution of
plausible outcomes, leading to stochastic instabilities and physical
hallucinations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this emergent capability can
be actively constrained toward physical realism by SOPHIA, where
vision-language model agents evaluate the DiT-generated output and guide its
refinement by iteratively evolving the language instructions. In addition, a
co-trained Inverse Dynamics Model translates these refined plans into
executable robotic actions, thus closing the imagination-to-action loop. We
establish WoWBench, a new benchmark focused on physical consistency and causal
reasoning in video, where WoW achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
human and autonomous evaluation, demonstrating strong ability in physical
causality, collision dynamics, and object permanence. Our work provides
systematic evidence that large-scale, real-world interaction is a cornerstone
for developing physical intuition in AI. Models, data, and benchmarks will be
open-sourced.

Conclusion: 该方法为机器人操作的可扩展测试时计算提供了一条潜在路径。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) achieve strong performance in general
robotic manipulation tasks by scaling imitation learning. However, existing
VLAs are limited to predicting short-sighted next-action, which struggle with
long-horizon trajectory tasks due to incremental deviations. To address this
problem, we propose a plug-in framework named VLA-Reasoner that effectively
empowers off-the-shelf VLAs with the capability of foreseeing future states via
test-time scaling. Specifically, VLA-Reasoner samples and rolls out possible
action trajectories where involved actions are rationales to generate future
states via a world model, which enables VLA-Reasoner to foresee and reason
potential outcomes and search for the optimal actions. We further leverage
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to improve search efficiency in large action
spaces, where stepwise VLA predictions seed the root. Meanwhile, we introduce a
confidence sampling mechanism based on Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), to
enable efficient exploration in MCTS without redundant VLA queries. We evaluate
intermediate states in MCTS via an offline reward shaping strategy, to score
predicted futures and correct deviations with long-term feedback. We conducted
extensive experiments in both simulators and the real world, demonstrating that
our proposed VLA-Reasoner achieves significant improvements over the
state-of-the-art VLAs. Our method highlights a potential pathway toward
scalable test-time computation of robotic manipulation.

Result: SPF在DRL仿真基准测试中创造了新的最先进水平，比之前最佳方法绝对提升了63%。在广泛的真实世界评估中，SPF大幅优于强基线方法，并显示出对不同VLM的显著泛化能力。

Conclusion: SPF通过将动作预测重新定义为2D空间定位任务，实现了在各种环境和指令类型下的高效航空视觉语言导航，在仿真和真实世界测试中都表现出卓越性能。

Abstract: We present See, Point, Fly (SPF), a training-free aerial vision-and-language
navigation (AVLN) framework built atop vision-language models (VLMs). SPF is
capable of navigating to any goal based on any type of free-form instructions
in any kind of environment. In contrast to existing VLM-based approaches that
treat action prediction as a text generation task, our key insight is to
consider action prediction for AVLN as a 2D spatial grounding task. SPF
harnesses VLMs to decompose vague language instructions into iterative
annotation of 2D waypoints on the input image. Along with the predicted
traveling distance, SPF transforms predicted 2D waypoints into 3D displacement
vectors as action commands for UAVs. Moreover, SPF also adaptively adjusts the
traveling distance to facilitate more efficient navigation. Notably, SPF
performs navigation in a closed-loop control manner, enabling UAVs to follow
dynamic targets in dynamic environments. SPF sets a new state of the art in DRL
simulation benchmark, outperforming the previous best method by an absolute
margin of 63%. In extensive real-world evaluations, SPF outperforms strong
baselines by a large margin. We also conduct comprehensive ablation studies to
highlight the effectiveness of our design choice. Lastly, SPF shows remarkable
generalization to different VLMs. Project page: https://spf-web.pages.dev

*Weikai Lin,Haoxiang Li,Yuhao Zhu*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: ControlHair是一个混合框架，将物理模拟器与条件视频扩散相结合，实现可控的动态头发渲染。它通过三阶段流程：物理参数编码、控制信号提取和视频生成，实现了对头发动力学的精确控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频扩散模型虽然能生成高质量视频，但缺乏对头发动力学的细粒度控制。头发模拟和渲染面临复杂动力学、多样材质特性和复杂光发交互的挑战。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：1) 使用物理模拟器将物理参数编码为逐帧几何；2) 提取逐帧控制信号；3) 将控制信号输入视频扩散模型生成视频。这种级联设计将物理推理与视频生成解耦。

Result: 在精心策划的10K视频数据集上训练，ControlHair在头发动力学控制方面优于基于文本和姿态的基线方法，能够精确控制头发动力学。

Conclusion: ControlHair是首个基于物理信息的视频扩散框架，支持动态发型试戴、子弹时间效果和电影图形等应用场景，为可控动力学提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Hair simulation and rendering are challenging due to complex strand dynamics,
diverse material properties, and intricate light-hair interactions. Recent
video diffusion models can generate high-quality videos, but they lack
fine-grained control over hair dynamics. We present ControlHair, a hybrid
framework that integrates a physics simulator with conditional video diffusion
to enable controllable dynamic hair rendering. ControlHair adopts a three-stage
pipeline: it first encodes physics parameters (e.g., hair stiffness, wind) into
per-frame geometry using a simulator, then extracts per-frame control signals,
and finally feeds control signals into a video diffusion model to generate
videos with desired hair dynamics. This cascaded design decouples physics
reasoning from video generation, supports diverse physics, and makes training
the video diffusion model easy. Trained on a curated 10K video dataset,
ControlHair outperforms text- and pose-conditioned baselines, delivering
precisely controlled hair dynamics. We further demonstrate three use cases of
ControlHair: dynamic hairstyle try-on, bullet-time effects, and cinemagraphic.
ControlHair introduces the first physics-informed video diffusion framework for
controllable dynamics. We provide a teaser video and experimental results on
our website.

TL;DR: PowerGS是一个针对3D高斯泼溅(3DGS)的功耗优化框架，通过联合最小化渲染和显示功耗，在质量约束下实现高达86%的总功耗降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS系列模型在功耗受限的扩展现实(XR)设备上效率不足，这些设备需要在瓦特级别运行。

Method: 提出通用问题公式化，通过识别显示和渲染功耗景观中的等质量曲线，并找到给定曲线上功耗最小点（具有闭式解），同时支持注视点渲染以进一步节能。

Result: 实验和用户研究表明，与最先进的3DGS模型相比，PowerGS实现了高达86%的总功耗降低，主观和客观质量损失最小。

Conclusion: PowerGS是首个在质量约束下联合最小化3DGS渲染和显示功耗的框架，为功耗敏感的XR设备提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) combines classic image-based rendering,
pointbased graphics, and modern differentiable techniques, and offers an
interesting alternative to traditional physically-based rendering. 3DGS-family
models are far from efficient for power-constrained Extended Reality (XR)
devices, which need to operate at a Watt-level. This paper introduces PowerGS,
the first framework to jointly minimize the rendering and display power in 3DGS
under a quality constraint. We present a general problem formulation and show
that solving the problem amounts to 1) identifying the iso-quality curve(s) in
the landscape subtended by the display and rendering power and 2) identifying
the power-minimal point on a given curve, which has a closed-form solution
given a proper parameterization of the curves. PowerGS also readily supports
foveated rendering for further power savings. Extensive experiments and user
studies show that PowerGS achieves up to 86% total power reduction compared to
state-of-the-art 3DGS models, with minimal loss in both subjective and
objective quality. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法依赖多视角视频恢复变形，限制了在受限场景下的应用。需要从单张图像有效重建物体变形的方法。

Method: 提出DeformSplat框架，包含两个关键技术：高斯-像素匹配（桥接3D高斯表示与2D像素观察的领域差距）和刚性部件分割（识别刚性区域以保持几何一致性）

Result: 实验表明该方法显著优于现有方法，并能自然扩展到帧插值和交互式物体操作等应用

Conclusion: DeformSplat能够从单张图像重建一致的变形，为单图像变形重建提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Reconstructing object deformation from a single image remains a significant
challenge in computer vision and graphics. Existing methods typically rely on
multi-view video to recover deformation, limiting their applicability under
constrained scenarios. To address this, we propose DeformSplat, a novel
framework that effectively guides 3D Gaussian deformation from only a single
image. Our method introduces two main technical contributions. First, we
present Gaussian-to-Pixel Matching which bridges the domain gap between 3D
Gaussian representations and 2D pixel observations. This enables robust
deformation guidance from sparse visual cues. Second, we propose Rigid Part
Segmentation consisting of initialization and refinement. This segmentation
explicitly identifies rigid regions, crucial for maintaining geometric
coherence during deformation. By combining these two techniques, our approach
can reconstruct consistent deformations from a single image. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing
methods and naturally extends to various applications,such as frame
interpolation and interactive object manipulation.

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了城市几何和纹理协同捕获问题，能够在有限先验知识下实现高质量的城市场景重建，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Recent advances in image acquisition and scene reconstruction have enabled
the generation of high-quality structural urban scene geometry, given
sufficient site information. However, current capture techniques often overlook
the crucial importance of texture quality, resulting in noticeable visual
artifacts in the textured models. In this work, we introduce the urban geometry
and texture co-capture problem under limited prior knowledge before a site
visit. The only inputs are a 2D building contour map of the target area and a
safe flying altitude above the buildings. We propose an innovative aerial path
planning framework designed to co-capture images for reconstructing both
structured geometry and high-fidelity textures. To evaluate and guide view
planning, we introduce a comprehensive texture quality assessment system,
including two novel metrics tailored for building facades. Firstly, our method
generates high-quality vertical dipping views and horizontal planar views to
effectively capture both geometric and textural details. A multi-objective
optimization strategy is then proposed to jointly maximize texture fidelity,
improve geometric accuracy, and minimize the cost associated with aerial views.
Furthermore, we present a sequential path planning algorithm that accounts for
texture consistency during image capture. Extensive experiments on large-scale
synthetic and real-world urban datasets demonstrate that our approach
effectively produces image sets suitable for concurrent geometric and texture
reconstruction, enabling the creation of realistic, textured scene proxies at
low operational cost.

Abstract: Learning a control policy for a multi-phase, long-horizon task, such as
basketball maneuvers, remains challenging for reinforcement learning approaches
due to the need for seamless policy composition and transitions between skills.
A long-horizon task typically consists of distinct subtasks with well-defined
goals, separated by transitional subtasks with unclear goals but critical to
the success of the entire task. Existing methods like the mixture of experts
and skill chaining struggle with tasks where individual policies do not share
significant commonly explored states or lack well-defined initial and terminal
states between different phases. In this paper, we introduce a novel policy
integration framework to enable the composition of drastically different motor
skills in multi-phase long-horizon tasks with ill-defined intermediate states.
Based on that, we further introduce a high-level soft router to enable seamless
and robust transitions between the subtasks. We evaluate our framework on a set
of fundamental basketball skills and challenging transitions. Policies trained
by our approach can effectively control the simulated character to interact
with the ball and accomplish the long-horizon task specified by real-time user
commands, without relying on ball trajectory references.

Motivation: 多智能体系统在视觉语言模型驱动下存在视觉幻觉雪球效应，单个智能体的幻觉会通过文本流被后续智能体放大，导致视觉注意力分配减少。

Method: 通过注意力分析识别关键视觉令牌，提出ViF方法：使用视觉流传递选定的视觉中继令牌，并应用注意力重分配来增强视觉模式。

Conclusion: ViF是一种轻量级即插即用的缓解范式，能有效解决多智能体系统中的视觉幻觉雪球问题。

Abstract: Multi-Agent System (MAS) powered by Visual Language Models (VLMs) enables
challenging tasks but suffers from a novel failure term, multi-agent visual
hallucination snowballing, where hallucinations are seeded in a single agent
and amplified by following ones due to the over-reliance on textual flow to
relay visual information. Through turn-, layer-, and token-wise attention
analyses, we provide detailed insights into the essence of hallucination
snowballing regarding the reduction of visual attention allocation. It leads us
to identify a subset of vision tokens with a unimodal attention peak in middle
layers that best preserve visual evidence but gradually diminish in deeper
agent turns, resulting in the visual hallucination snowballing in MAS. Thus, we
propose ViF, a lightweight, plug-and-play mitigation paradigm that relays
inter-agent messages with Visual Flow powered by the selected visual relay
tokens and applies attention reallocation to amplify this pattern. The
experiment results demonstrate that our method markedly reduces hallucination
snowballing, consistently improving the performance across eight benchmarks
based on four common MAS structures and ten base models. The source code will
be available at: https://github.com/YU-deep/ViF.git.

Result: RobustFlow将工作流鲁棒性得分提升至70%-90%，相比现有方法有显著改进。

Conclusion: RobustFlow框架有效解决了代理工作流生成的不稳定性问题，为LLM在复杂任务中的可靠应用提供了重要保障。

Abstract: The automated generation of agentic workflows is a promising frontier for
enabling large language models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks. However, our
investigation reveals that the robustness of agentic workflow remains a
critical, unaddressed challenge. Current methods often generate wildly
inconsistent workflows when provided with instructions that are semantically
identical but differently phrased. This brittleness severely undermines their
reliability and trustworthiness for real-world applications. To quantitatively
diagnose this instability, we propose metrics based on nodal and topological
similarity to evaluate workflow consistency against common semantic variations
such as paraphrasing and noise injection. Subsequently, we further propose a
novel training framework, RobustFlow, that leverages preference optimization to
teach models invariance to instruction variations. By training on sets of
synonymous task descriptions, RobustFlow boosts workflow robustness scores to
70\% - 90\%, which is a substantial improvement over existing approaches. The
code is publicly available at https://github.com/DEFENSE-SEU/RobustFlow.

Conclusion: 基于决策变换器的去中心化规划框架结合大语言模型，为多智能体路径规划提供了高效、适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) poses a significant and challenging problem
critical for applications in robotics and logistics, particularly due to its
combinatorial complexity and the partial observability inherent in realistic
environments. Decentralized reinforcement learning methods commonly encounter
two substantial difficulties: first, they often yield self-centered behaviors
among agents, resulting in frequent collisions, and second, their reliance on
complex communication modules leads to prolonged training times, sometimes
spanning weeks. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient
decentralized planning framework based on the Decision Transformer (DT),
uniquely leveraging offline reinforcement learning to substantially reduce
training durations from weeks to mere hours. Crucially, our approach
effectively handles long-horizon credit assignment and significantly improves
performance in scenarios with sparse and delayed rewards. Furthermore, to
overcome adaptability limitations inherent in standard RL methods under dynamic
environmental changes, we integrate a large language model (GPT-4o) to
dynamically guide agent policies. Extensive experiments in both static and
dynamically changing environments demonstrate that our DT-based approach,
augmented briefly by GPT-4o, significantly enhances adaptability and
performance.

Abstract: This study examines the potential impact of reinforcement learning
(RL)-enabled autonomous vehicles (AV) on urban traffic flow in a mixed traffic
environment. We focus on a simplified day-to-day route choice problem in a
multi-agent setting. We consider a city network where human drivers travel
through their chosen routes to reach their destinations in minimum travel time.
Then, we convert one-third of the population into AVs, which are RL agents
employing Deep Q-learning algorithm. We define a set of optimization targets,
or as we call them behaviors, namely selfish, collaborative, competitive,
social, altruistic, and malicious. We impose a selected behavior on AVs through
their rewards. We run our simulations using our in-house developed RL framework
PARCOUR. Our simulations reveal that AVs optimize their travel times by up to
5\%, with varying impacts on human drivers' travel times depending on the AV
behavior. In all cases where AVs adopt a self-serving behavior, they achieve
shorter travel times than human drivers. Our findings highlight the complexity
differences in learning tasks of each target behavior. We demonstrate that the
multi-agent RL setting is applicable for collective routing on traffic
networks, though their impact on coexisting parties greatly varies with the
behaviors adopted.

Conclusion: 提出的两种算法在多智能体在线协调问题中有效，特别是新提出的基于策略的连续扩展技术能够处理具有挑战性的弱次模目标。

Abstract: In this paper, we present two effective policy learning algorithms for
multi-agent online coordination(MA-OC) problem. The first one, \texttt{MA-SPL},
not only can achieve the optimal $(1-\frac{c}{e})$-approximation guarantee for
the MA-OC problem with submodular objectives but also can handle the unexplored
$\alpha$-weakly DR-submodular and $(\gamma,\beta)$-weakly submodular scenarios,
where $c$ is the curvature of the investigated submodular functions, $\alpha$
denotes the diminishing-return(DR) ratio and the tuple $(\gamma,\beta)$
represents the submodularity ratios. Subsequently, in order to reduce the
reliance on the unknown parameters $\alpha,\gamma,\beta$ inherent in the
\texttt{MA-SPL} algorithm, we further introduce the second online algorithm
named \texttt{MA-MPL}. This \texttt{MA-MPL} algorithm is entirely
\emph{parameter-free} and simultaneously can maintain the same approximation
ratio as the first \texttt{MA-SPL} algorithm. The core of our \texttt{MA-SPL}
and \texttt{MA-MPL} algorithms is a novel continuous-relaxation technique
termed as \emph{policy-based continuous extension}. Compared with the
well-established \emph{multi-linear extension}, a notable advantage of this new
\emph{policy-based continuous extension} is its ability to provide a lossless
rounding scheme for any set function, thereby enabling us to tackle the
challenging weakly submodular objectives. Finally, extensive simulations are
conducted to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.

Abstract: Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) use smart contracts to foster
communities working toward common goals. Existing definitions of
decentralization, however -- the 'D' in DAO -- fall short of capturing the key
properties characteristic of diverse and equitable participation. This work
proposes a new framework for measuring DAO decentralization called Voting-Bloc
Entropy (VBE, pronounced ''vibe''). VBE is based on the idea that voters with
closely aligned interests act as a centralizing force and should be modeled as
such. VBE formalizes this notion by measuring the similarity of participants'
utility functions across a set of voting rounds. Unlike prior, ad hoc
definitions of decentralization, VBE derives from first principles: We
introduce a simple (yet powerful) reinforcement learning-based conceptual model
for voting, that in turn implies VBE. We first show VBE's utility as a
theoretical tool. We prove a number of results about the (de)centralizing
effects of vote delegation, proposal bundling, bribery, etc. that are
overlooked in previous notions of DAO decentralization. Our results lead to
practical suggestions for enhancing DAO decentralization. We also show how VBE
can be used empirically by presenting measurement studies and VBE-based
governance experiments. We make the tools we developed for these results
available to the community in the form of open-source artifacts in order to
facilitate future study of DAO decentralization.

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly supports human decision-making,
its vulnerability to adversarial attacks grows. However, the existing
adversarial analysis predominantly focuses on fully autonomous AI systems,
where decisions are executed without human intervention. This narrow focus
overlooks the complexities of human-AI collaboration, where humans interpret,
adjust, and act upon AI-generated decisions. Trust, expectations, and cognitive
behaviors influence how humans interact with AI, creating dynamic feedback
loops that adversaries can exploit. To strengthen the robustness of AI-assisted
decision-making, adversarial analysis must account for the interplay between
human factors and attack strategies.
  This position paper argues that human factors fundamentally reshape
adversarial analysis and must be incorporated into evaluating robustness in
human-AI decision-making systems. To fully explore human factors in adversarial
analysis, we begin by investigating the role of human factors in human-AI
collaboration through a comprehensive review. We then introduce a novel
robustness analysis framework that (1) examines how human factors affect
collaborative decision-making performance, (2) revisits and interprets existing
adversarial attack strategies in the context of human-AI interaction, and (3)
introduces a new timing-based adversarial attack as a case study, illustrating
vulnerabilities emerging from sequential human actions. The experimental
results reveal that attack timing uniquely impacts decision outcomes in
human-AI collaboration. We hope this analysis inspires future research on
adversarial robustness in human-AI systems, fostering interdisciplinary
approaches that integrate AI security, human cognition, and decision-making
dynamics.

TL;DR: 本文通过比较40名人类参与者与AI数字孪生在Amazon Rufus购物任务中的交互轨迹，首次量化评估了LLM代理在模拟人类与智能AI系统多轮交互方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着智能AI系统（如Copilot、Amazon Rufus）的快速发展，传统人工评估方法难以跟上其迭代速度。研究人员提出使用LLM代理作为数字孪生来模拟参与者，但尚不清楚数字孪生能在多大程度上代表特定客户与智能AI系统的多轮交互。

Method: 招募40名人类参与者使用Amazon Rufus进行购物，收集其个人资料、交互轨迹和用户体验反馈，然后创建数字孪生重复相同任务，并进行成对比较分析。

Result: 数字孪生虽然探索了更多样化的选择，但其行为模式与人类参与者一致，并产生了相似的设计反馈。

Conclusion: 这项研究首次量化证明了LLM代理能够较好地模拟人类与智能AI系统的多轮交互，突显了其在可扩展评估方面的潜力。

Abstract: Agentic AI is emerging, capable of executing tasks through natural language,
such as Copilot for coding or Amazon Rufus for shopping. Evaluating these
systems is challenging, as their rapid evolution outpaces traditional human
evaluation. Researchers have proposed LLM Agents to simulate participants as
digital twins, but it remains unclear to what extent a digital twin can
represent a specific customer in multi-turn interaction with an agentic AI
system. In this paper, we recruited 40 human participants to shop with Amazon
Rufus, collected their personas, interaction traces, and UX feedback, and then
created digital twins to repeat the task. Pairwise comparison of human and
digital-twin traces shows that while agents often explored more diverse
choices, their action patterns aligned with humans and yielded similar design
feedback. This study is the first to quantify how closely LLM agents can mirror
human multi-turn interaction with an agentic AI system, highlighting their
potential for scalable evaluation.

*Jianan Zhou,Fleur Corbett,Joori Byun,Talya Porat,Nejra van Zalk*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 系统综述和荟萃分析显示，与人类相比，个体在与智能体互动时表现出更少的亲社会行为和道德参与，对智能体的能力、责任和社会存在感评价较低，但功能性行为和互动体验与人类互动相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管智能体已具备类人能力，但人类对其反应的研究仍分散在不同学科中，需要系统比较人类-智能体与人类-人类互动中的心理和行为反应。

Method: 对162项符合条件的研究进行系统综述和荟萃分析（146项贡献于荟萃分析；468个效应量），整合频率论和贝叶斯方法，比较匹配的人类-智能体与人类-人类二元互动。

Result: 个体与智能体互动时亲社会行为和道德参与较少，对智能体的能力、责任和社会存在感评价较低；但社会对齐、信任、个人能动性、任务表现和互动体验与人类互动相当；主观反应存在高度异质性。

Conclusion: 智能体在功能性行为和互动体验上可与人类相媲美，但在基本社会归因和道德/亲社会关注方面落后，具有工具价值但缺乏内在价值，对智能体设计和监管具有实践意义。

Abstract: Interactive intelligent agents are being integrated across society. Despite
achieving human-like capabilities, humans' responses to these agents remain
poorly understood, with research fragmented across disciplines. We conducted a
first systematic synthesis comparing a range of psychological and behavioural
responses in matched human-agent vs. human-human dyadic interactions. A total
of 162 eligible studies (146 contributed to the meta-analysis; 468 effect
sizes) were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis, which
integrated frequentist and Bayesian approaches. Our results indicate that
individuals exhibited less prosocial behaviour and moral engagement when
interacting with agents vs. humans. They attributed less agency and
responsibility to agents, perceiving them as less competent, likeable, and
socially present. In contrast, individuals' social alignment (i.e., alignment
or adaptation of internal states and behaviours with partners), trust in
partners, personal agency, task performance, and interaction experiences were
generally comparable when interacting with agents vs. humans. We observed high
effect-size heterogeneity for many subjective responses (i.e., social
perceptions of partners, subjective trust, and interaction experiences),
suggesting context-dependency of partner effects. By examining the
characteristics of studies, participants, partners, interaction scenarios, and
response measures, we also identified several moderators shaping partner
effects. Overall, functional behaviours and interactive experiences with agents
can resemble those with humans, whereas fundamental social attributions and
moral/prosocial concerns lag in human-agent interactions. Agents are thus
afforded instrumental value on par with humans but lack comparable intrinsic
value, providing practical implications for agent design and regulation.

*Nana Wang,Gen Li,Zhaoxin Fan,Suli Wang*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: EMG-UP是一个用于跨用户肌电手势识别的无监督个性化框架，通过两阶段适应策略解决肌电信号的生物变异性问题，在准确率上比现有方法至少提升2.0%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于肌电信号的生物变异性（解剖异质性和任务执行风格差异），现有方法难以在跨用户场景中有效泛化，限制了实际应用中可扩展和个性化的人机交互。

Method: 采用两阶段适应策略：1）序列交叉视角对比学习，通过捕捉跨用户不变的内在信号模式来解耦稳健和用户特定的特征表示；2）伪标签引导的微调，无需源域数据即可为个体用户进行模型优化。

Result: 广泛评估表明EMG-UP实现了最先进的性能，在准确率上比先前方法至少高出2.0%。

Conclusion: EMG-UP框架有效解决了跨用户肌电手势识别中的个性化挑战，为实际应用中的可扩展人机交互提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-user electromyography (EMG)-based gesture recognition represents a
fundamental challenge in achieving scalable and personalized human-machine
interaction within real-world applications. Despite extensive efforts, existing
methodologies struggle to generalize effectively across users due to the
intrinsic biological variability of EMG signals, resulting from anatomical
heterogeneity and diverse task execution styles. To address this limitation, we
introduce EMG-UP, a novel and effective framework for Unsupervised
Personalization in cross-user gesture recognition. The proposed framework
leverages a two-stage adaptation strategy: (1) Sequence-Cross Perspective
Contrastive Learning, designed to disentangle robust and user-specific feature
representations by capturing intrinsic signal patterns invariant to inter-user
variability, and (2) Pseudo-Label-Guided Fine-Tuning, which enables model
refinement for individual users without necessitating access to source domain
data. Extensive evaluations show that EMG-UP achieves state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming prior methods by at least 2.0% in accuracy.

TL;DR: 本文重新定义了AI奉承，将其分为信息性、认知性和情感性三种类型，提出了AI奉承处理模型(AISPM)，旨在统一概念边界并为系统化研究提供理论基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI奉承被认为是有害的对齐行为，但目前研究在概念层面仍然分散且不成熟，需要统一视角和澄清概念边界。

Method: 重新定义AI奉承概念，区分三种类型，引入消息层面的个性化和对话层面的关键提示作为关键维度，提出AI奉承处理模型(AISPM)。

Result: 建立了AI奉承的统一概念框架，提供了区分和检验不同AI奉承表现的方法，并提出了研究前因、结果和心理机制的理论模型。

Conclusion: 通过将AI奉承嵌入更广泛的传播理论和研究背景，为系统化、理论驱动的研究奠定了基础，统一了视角并澄清了概念边界。

Abstract: AI sycophancy is increasingly recognized as a harmful alignment, but research
remains fragmented and underdeveloped at the conceptual level. This article
redefines AI sycophancy as the tendency of large language models (LLMs) and
other interactive AI systems to excessively and/or uncritically validate,
amplify, or align with a user's assertions-whether these concern factual
information, cognitive evaluations, or affective states. Within this framework,
we distinguish three types of sycophancy: informational, cognitive, and
affective. We also introduce personalization at the message level and critical
prompting at the conversation level as key dimensions for distinguishing and
examining different manifestations of AI sycophancy. Finally, we propose the AI
Sycophancy Processing Model (AISPM) to examine the antecedents, outcomes, and
psychological mechanisms through which sycophantic AI responses shape user
experiences. By embedding AI sycophancy in the broader landscape of
communication theory and research, this article seeks to unify perspectives,
clarify conceptual boundaries, and provide a foundation for systematic,
theory-driven investigations.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: FlexMind是一个AI增强系统，通过支持想法的广度探索、深度评估和反思性评价，帮助用户生成更高质量的想法。与ChatGPT相比，FlexMind在创意生成质量上表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成式AI工具要么强调生成大量想法，要么支持深入考虑少数想法，缺乏对两者的同时支持。研究还指出过度依赖LLM存在浅层探索和负面创意结果的风险。

Method: 开发FlexMind系统，通过脚手架式方法支持想法的迭代探索、权衡分析和缓解措施考虑，让用户既能接触广泛想法又能轻松过渡到深度参与。

Result: 在与ChatGPT的比较研究中，使用FlexMind的参与者生成了更高质量的想法，这得益于更广泛的接触和对权衡的更深层次参与。

Conclusion: 通过在广度、深度和反思性评价方面搭建创意脚手架，FlexMind使用户能够发现那些可能被忽视或过早放弃的想法。

Abstract: Effective ideation requires both broad exploration of diverse ideas and deep
evaluation of their potential. Generative AI can support such processes, but
current tools typically emphasize either generating many ideas or supporting
in-depth consideration of a few, lacking support for both. Research also
highlights risks of over-reliance on LLMs, including shallow exploration and
negative creative outcomes. We present FlexMind, an AI-augmented system that
scaffolds iterative exploration of ideas, tradeoffs, and mitigations. FlexMind
exposes users to a broad set of ideas while enabling a lightweight transition
into deeper engagement. In a study comparing ideation with FlexMind to ChatGPT,
participants generated higher-quality ideas with FlexMind, due to both broader
exposure and deeper engagement with tradeoffs. By scaffolding ideation across
breadth, depth, and reflective evaluation, FlexMind empowers users to surface
ideas that might otherwise go unnoticed or be prematurely discarded.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个人情感具象化设计具有挑战性，因为情感是抽象的。AI在情感检测和设计辅助方面已显示出潜力，因此探索AI辅助个人情感具象化设计的机会。

Method: 采用通过设计研究的方法，开发PhEmotion工具，从人机对话中提取情感值并嵌入参数化设计。进行了实验室研究，14名参与者基于个人情感创建物理制品，有/无AI支持。

Result: 观察到参与者在创意策略、意义建构过程和对AI支持的感知方面存在细微差别和变化。发现了AI-人类共创中的关键张力。

Conclusion: 研究结果为AI辅助个人情感具象化的未来研究提供了细致的研究议程，重点关注AI-人类共创中的关键张力。

Abstract: Personal Affective Physicalization is the process by which individuals
express emotions through tangible forms to record, reflect on, and communicate.
Yet such physical data representations can be challenging to design due to the
abstract nature of emotions. Given the shown potential of AI in detecting
emotion and assisting design, we explore opportunities in AI-assisted design of
personal affective physicalization using a Research-through-Design method. We
developed PhEmotion, a tool for embedding LLM-extracted emotion values from
human-AI conversations into parametric design of physical artifacts. A lab
study was conducted with 14 participants creating these artifacts based on
their personal emotions, with and without AI support. We observed nuances and
variations in participants' creative strategies, meaning-making processes and
their perceptions of AI support in this context. We found key tensions in
AI-human co-creation that provide a nuanced agenda for future research in
AI-assisted personal affective physicalization.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究探讨了团队协作中生成式AI辅助创意工作流程，发现两种协作提示模式，GenAI帮助建立共识但被视为工具而非真正合作者，强调人-人协作在AI工具使用中的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注个人使用GenAI克服提示挑战，但缺乏对团队协作中提示与协作相互影响的研究，以及用户在此过程中的感知。

Method: 让具有设计或表演背景但GenAI经验较少的学生两人一组，使用GenAI基于创意主题创作舞台设计，观察他们的协作提示过程。

Result: 发现两种协作提示模式：先生成故事描述或先生成视觉图像；GenAI帮助参与者建立任务共识并讨论提示策略；参与者将GenAI视为高效工具而非真正合作者。

Conclusion: 人类合作伙伴减少了对GenAI的依赖，强调了在GenAI工具使用中人-人协作的重要性，建议系统在提示过程中利用共享的人类专业知识。

Abstract: Studies of Generative AI (GenAI)-assisted creative workflows have focused on
individuals overcoming challenges of prompting to produce what they envisioned.
When designers work in teams, how do collaboration and prompting influence each
other, and how do users perceive generative AI and their collaborators during
the co-prompting process? We engaged students with design or performance
backgrounds, and little exposure to GenAI, to work in pairs with GenAI to
create stage designs based on a creative theme. We found two patterns of
collaborative prompting focused on generating story descriptions first, or
visual imagery first. GenAI tools helped participants build consensus in the
task, and allowed for discussion of the prompting strategies. Participants
perceived GenAI as efficient tools rather than true collaborators, suggesting
that human partners reduced the reliance on their use. This work highlights the
importance of human-human collaboration when working with GenAI tools,
suggesting systems that take advantage of shared human expertise in the
prompting process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 屏幕使用已渗透日常生活，但单纯减少屏幕时间会过度简化技术角色并忽视其有意义参与的潜力。作者认为自我意识（反思数字行为）是数字幸福感的关键途径。

Method: 开发WellScreen轻量级探针，在两周部署中（N=25）让参与者估算和报告智能手机使用，研究估算与实际使用之间的差异如何影响数字意识和幸福感。

Result: 参与者经常低估生产力和社交媒体使用，高估娱乐应用使用。积极情绪改善10%，认为WellScreen中等有用。访谈显示结构化反思支持模式识别、期望调整和更意向性的技术参与。

Conclusion: 轻量级反思干预在支持自我意识和意向性数字参与方面具有潜力，为设计数字幸福感工具提供了启示。

Abstract: Screen use pervades daily life, shaping work, leisure, and social connections
while raising concerns for digital wellbeing. Yet, reducing screen time alone
risks oversimplifying technology's role and neglecting its potential for
meaningful engagement. We posit self-awareness -- reflecting on one's digital
behavior -- as a critical pathway to digital wellbeing. We developed
WellScreen, a lightweight probe that scaffolds daily reflection by asking
people to estimate and report smartphone use. In a two-week deployment (N=25),
we examined how discrepancies between estimated and actual usage shaped digital
awareness and wellbeing. Participants often underestimated productivity and
social media while overestimating entertainment app use. They showed a 10%
improvement in positive affect, rating WellScreen as moderately useful.
Interviews revealed that structured reflection supported recognition of
patterns, adjustment of expectations, and more intentional engagement with
technology. Our findings highlight the promise of lightweight reflective
interventions for supporting self-awareness and intentional digital engagement,
offering implications for designing digital wellbeing tools.

Motivation: 尽管LLM代理在社会模拟中用于政策制定的兴趣日益增长，但实际应用仍然有限。本文旨在探索如何使LLM代理模拟真正对政策制定有用。

Method: 与大学应急准备团队进行为期一年的迭代设计合作，开发了13,000个LLM代理系统，模拟大规模集会中各种紧急情况下的人群移动和通信。

Result: 模拟结果成功影响了实际政策实施，包括志愿者培训、疏散协议和基础设施规划。

Conclusion: 提出了三个设计启示：从可验证场景开始逐步建立信任，使用初步模拟获取隐性知识，将模拟与政策发展视为共同演进的过程，为LLM代理模拟在政策制定中的实际应用提供了可行路径。

Abstract: There is growing interest in using Large Language Models as agents (LLM
agents) for social simulations to inform policy, yet real-world adoption
remains limited. This paper addresses the question: How can LLM agent
simulations be made genuinely useful for policy? We report on a year-long
iterative design engagement with a university emergency preparedness team.
Across multiple design iterations, we iteratively developed a system of 13,000
LLM agents that simulate crowd movement and communication during a large-scale
gathering under various emergency scenarios. These simulations informed actual
policy implementation, shaping volunteer training, evacuation protocols, and
infrastructure planning. Analyzing this process, we identify three design
implications: start with verifiable scenarios and build trust gradually, use
preliminary simulations to elicit tacit knowledge, and treat simulation and
policy development as evolving together. These implications highlight
actionable pathways to making LLM agent simulations that are genuinely useful
for policy.

TL;DR: 研究显示，在编程数据分析中，技术专业知识比AI熟悉度或沟通能力更能预测学生使用LLMs的成功率。学生使用LLMs时在意图形成、输入表达、输出解释和结果评估等阶段存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在编程数据分析中的民主化潜力，但发现并非所有人都能平等受益，需要了解不同专业背景学生如何使用LLMs以及哪些专业知识最重要。

Method: 通过对36名非专业课程学生的作业日志、录音和调查进行混合方法分析，研究不同专业背景学生使用LLMs完成Python数据分析的情况。

Result: 技术专业知识是成功的主要预测因素；学生在使用LLMs的各个阶段表现差异很大；识别了提供上下文、分解提示等成功行为和失败行为。

Conclusion: 轻量级演示只能提高表面流畅度，需要更深入的培训和支架来培养有韧性的AI使用技能，这对AI素养干预具有重要启示。

Abstract: LLMs promise to democratize technical work in complex domains like
programmatic data analysis, but not everyone benefits equally. We study how
students with varied expertise use LLMs to complete Python-based data analysis
in computational notebooks in a non-major course. Drawing on homework logs,
recordings, and surveys from 36 students, we ask: Which expertise matters most,
and how does it shape AI use? Our mixed-methods analysis shows that technical
expertise -- not AI familiarity or communication skills -- remains a
significant predictor of success. Students also vary widely in how they
leverage LLMs, struggling at stages of forming intent, expressing inputs,
interpreting outputs, and assessing results. We identify success and failure
behaviors, such as providing context or decomposing prompts, that distinguish
effective use. These findings inform AI literacy interventions, highlighting
that lightweight demonstrations improve surface fluency but are insufficient;
deeper training and scaffolds are needed to cultivate resilient AI use skills.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动应用已成为日常生活的重要工具，但硬件限制和多样化用户需求带来了设计和开发挑战。虽然可用性是最关键的问题之一，但很少有研究直接讨论在移动应用开发中避免可用性问题的具体对策。

Method: 采用质性研究方法，对20名移动软件设计和开发从业者进行调查，使用in vivo编码技术分析收集的质性数据，以捕捉和保留专家陈述中的内在含义。

Result: 开发了一个新颖的框架，包含10条指南和3项具有普遍适用性的活动。分析发现，在移动应用开发的每个阶段，与用户在测试和收集反馈方面的积极合作经常被强调。

Conclusion: 未来的研究应考虑进行聚焦的行动研究，评估所提建议的有效性并在不同利益相关者群体中进行验证。此外，开发自动化工具以支持在移动应用开发过程中早期检测和缓解可用性问题也值得考虑。

Abstract: Nowadays, mobile applications are essential tools for everyday life,
providing users with anytime, anywhere access to up-to-date information,
communication, and entertainment. Needless to say, hardware limitations and the
diverse needs of different user groups pose a number of design and development
challenges. According to recent studies, usability is one of the most revealing
among many others. However, few have made the direct effort to provide and
discuss what countermeasures can be applied to avoid usability issues in mobile
application development. Through a survey of 20 mobile software design and
development practitioners, this study aims to fill this research gap. Given the
qualitative nature of the data collected, and with the goal of capturing and
preserving the intrinsic meanings embedded in the experts' statements, we
adopted in vivo coding. The analysis of the collected material enabled us to
develop a novel framework consisting of ten guidelines and three activities
with general applications. In addition, it can be noted that active
collaboration with users in testing and collecting feedback was often
emphasized at each stage of mobile application development. Future research
should consider focused action research that evaluates the effectiveness of our
recommendations and validates them across different stakeholder groups. In this
regard, the development of automated tools to support early detection and
mitigation of usability issues during mobile application development could also
be considered.

Abstract: The integration of socially assistive robots (SARs) in elder care settings
has the potential to address critical labor shortages while enhancing the
quality of care. However, the design of SARs must align with the values of
various stakeholders to ensure their acceptance and efficacy. This study
empirically investigates the values that should be embedded in SARs from a
multi-stakeholder perspective, including care receivers, caregivers,
therapists, relatives, and other involved parties. Utilizing a combination of
semi-structured interviews and focus groups, we identify a wide range of values
related to safety, trust, care, privacy, and autonomy, and illustrate how
stakeholders interpret these values in real-world care environments. Our
findings reveal several value tensions and propose potential resolutions to
these tensions. Additionally, the study highlights under-researched values such
as calmness and collaboration, which are critical in fostering a supportive and
efficient care environment. Our work contributes to the understanding of
value-sensitive design of SARs and aids practitioners in developing SARs that
align with human values, ultimately promoting socially responsible applications
in elder care settings.

Abstract: Commonaiverse is an interactive installation exploring human emotions through
full-body motion tracking and real-time AI feedback. Participants engage in
three phases: Teaching, Exploration and the Cosmos Phase, collaboratively
expressing and interpreting emotions with the system. The installation
integrates MoveNet for precise motion tracking and a multi-recommender AI
system to analyze emotional states dynamically, responding with adaptive
audiovisual outputs. By shifting from top-down emotion classification to
participant-driven, culturally diverse definitions, we highlight new pathways
for inclusive, ethical affective computing. We discuss how this collaborative,
out-of-the-box approach pushes multimedia research beyond single-user facial
analysis toward a more embodied, co-created paradigm of emotional AI.
Furthermore, we reflect on how this reimagined framework fosters user agency,
reduces bias, and opens avenues for advanced interactive applications.

Abstract: Human autonomy and sense of agency are increasingly recognised as critical
for user well-being, motivation, and the ethical deployment of robots in
human-robot interaction (HRI). Given the rapid development of artificial
intelligence, robot capabilities and their potential to function as colleagues
and companions are growing. This systematic literature review synthesises 22
empirical studies selected from an initial pool of 728 articles published
between 2011 and 2024. Articles were retrieved from major scientific databases
and identified based on empirical focus and conceptual relevance, namely, how
to preserve and promote human autonomy and sense of agency in HRI. Derived
through thematic synthesis, five clusters of potentially influential factors
are revealed: robot adaptiveness, communication style, anthropomorphism,
presence of a robot and individual differences. Measured through psychometric
scales or the intentional binding paradigm, perceptions of autonomy and agency
varied across industrial, educational, healthcare, care, and hospitality
settings. The review underscores the theoretical differences between both
concepts, but their yet entangled use in HRI. Despite increasing interest, the
current body of empirical evidence remains limited and fragmented, underscoring
the necessity for standardised definitions, more robust operationalisations,
and further exploratory and qualitative research. By identifying existing gaps
and highlighting emerging trends, this review contributes to the development of
human-centered, autonomy-supportive robot design strategies that uphold ethical
and psychological principles, ultimately supporting well-being in human-robot
interaction.

Result: 故障后信任和自主性均受损，故障严重程度对信任负面影响更强，但对自主性影响不显著。透明沟通能部分恢复信任和自主性。

Conclusion: 协作机器人故障会损害工人信任和自主性，透明沟通是有效的恢复策略，对工业5.0人本设计具有重要意义。

Abstract: Collaborative robots (cobots) are a core technology of Industry 4.0. Industry
4.0 uses cyber-physical systems, IoT and smart automation to improve efficiency
and data-driven decision-making. Cobots, as cyber-physical systems, enable the
introduction of lightweight automation to smaller companies through their
flexibility, low cost and ability to work alongside humans, while keeping
humans and their skills in the loop. Industry 5.0, the evolution of Industry
4.0, places the worker at the centre of its principles: The physical and mental
well-being of the worker is the main goal of new technology design, not just
productivity, efficiency and safety standards. Within this concept, human trust
in cobots and human autonomy are important. While trust is essential for
effective and smooth interaction, the workers' perception of autonomy is key to
intrinsic motivation and overall well-being. As failures are an inevitable part
of technological systems, this study aims to answer the question of how system
failures affect trust in cobots as well as human autonomy, and how they can be
recovered afterwards. Therefore, a VR experiment (n = 39) was set up to
investigate the influence of a cobot failure and its severity on human autonomy
and trust in the cobot. Furthermore, the influence of transparent communication
about the failure and next steps was investigated. The results show that both
trust and autonomy suffer after cobot failures, with the severity of the
failure having a stronger negative impact on trust, but not on autonomy. Both
trust and autonomy can be partially restored by transparent communication.

Motivation: 维基百科高度依赖自动化机器人来填补人力不足，但现有研究主要关注已部署的机器人，而忽略了文献中提出的内容生成方法。本文旨在填补这一研究空白。

Method: 采用系统性文献综述方法，分析研究人员如何操作和评估维基百科的自动内容生成代理，包括生成方法范围、技术模型、源内容使用和评估方法学。

Result: 识别了内容生成方法的范围、使用的技术和模型、用于生成的源内容以及支持生成过程的评估方法学。

Conclusion: 本文首次系统性地回顾了这种被低估的AI支持形式对维基百科社区的潜在贡献，超越了现有机器人的实施范围，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Wikipedia is among the largest examples of collective intelligence on the Web
with over 61 million articles covering over 320 languages. Although edited and
maintained by an active workforce of human volunteers, Wikipedia is highly
reliant on automated bots to fill gaps in its human workforce. As well as
administrative and governance tasks, these bots also play a role in generating
content, although to date such agents represent the smallest proportion of
bots. While there has been considerable analysis of bots and their activity in
Wikipedia, such work captures only automated agents that have been actively
deployed to Wikipedia and fails to capture the methods that have been proposed
to generate Wikipedia content in the wider literature. In this paper, we
conduct a systematic literature review to explore how researchers have
operationalised and evaluated automated content-generation agents for
Wikipedia. We identify the scope of these generation methods, the techniques
and models used, the source content used for generation and the evaluation
methodologies which support generation processes. We also explore implications
of our findings to CSCW, User Generated Content and Wikipedia, as well as
research directions for future development. To the best of our knowledge, we
are among the first to review the potential contributions of this understudied
form of AI support for the Wikipedia community beyond the implementation of
bots.

TL;DR: AI伴侣聊天机器人对用户心理健康有复杂影响：既增加情感表达和人际关注，也带来孤独感和自杀意念风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI伴侣聊天机器人日益流行，但其心理社会影响尚不明确，需要系统研究其对用户福祉的影响。

Method: 结合大规模准实验研究（Reddit纵向数据分析）和15个半结构化访谈的主题分析。

Result: 发现混合效应：增强情感表达、悲伤表达、可读性和人际关注，但同时增加了关于孤独和自杀意念的语言表达。

Conclusion: 需要设计支持健康边界、促进正念参与、支持披露但不产生依赖的AI伴侣，以最大化心理社会效益并降低风险。

Abstract: AI-powered companion chatbots (AICCs) such as Replika are increasingly
popular, offering empathetic interactions, yet their psychosocial impacts
remain unclear. We examined how engaging with AICCs shaped wellbeing and how
users perceived these experiences. First, we conducted a large-scale
quasi-experimental study of longitudinal Reddit data, applying stratified
propensity score matching and Difference-in-Differences regression. Findings
revealed mixed effects -- greater affective and grief expression, readability,
and interpersonal focus, alongside increases in language about loneliness and
suicidal ideation. Second, we complemented these results with 15
semi-structured interviews, which we thematically analyzed and contextualized
using Knapp's relationship development model. We identified trajectories of
initiation, escalation, and bonding, wherein AICCs provided emotional
validation and social rehearsal but also carried risks of over-reliance and
withdrawal. Triangulating across methods, we offer design implications for AI
companions that scaffold healthy boundaries, support mindful engagement,
support disclosure without dependency, and surface relationship stages --
maximizing psychosocial benefits while mitigating risks.

TL;DR: Trucey AI教练在减少谈判恐惧方面表现最佳，但传统手册在可用性和心理赋权方面优于AI工具。研究发现AI指导冗长零散，而手册的全面可回顾内容对用户信心和准备度更关键。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工作场所谈判受心理障碍影响，AI提供个性化谈判辅导，但其在谈判准备方面的有效性尚不明确。

Method: 开发基于Brett谈判模型的Trucey AI教练原型，进行267人组间实验，比较Trucey、ChatGPT和传统谈判手册，并进行15人深度访谈。

Result: Trucey在减少恐惧方面表现最强，但手册在可用性和心理赋权方面优于两个AI系统。访谈显示手册的全面可回顾内容对用户信心至关重要，而AI指导被认为冗长零散。

Conclusion: 挑战了AI优越性假设，建议设计混合系统，整合结构化理论内容与针对性演练、清晰边界和自适应支架，以解决心理障碍并支持谈判准备。

Abstract: Workplace negotiations are undermined by psychological barriers, which can
even derail well-prepared tactics. AI offers personalized and always --
available negotiation coaching, yet its effectiveness for negotiation
preparedness remains unclear. We built Trucey, a prototype AI coach grounded in
Brett's negotiation model. We conducted a between-subjects experiment (N=267),
comparing Trucey, ChatGPT, and a traditional negotiation Handbook, followed by
in-depth interviews (N=15). While Trucey showed the strongest reductions in
fear relative to both comparison conditions, the Handbook outperformed both AIs
in usability and psychological empowerment. Interviews revealed that the
Handbook's comprehensive, reviewable content was crucial for participants'
confidence and preparedness. In contrast, although participants valued AI's
rehearsal capability, its guidance often felt verbose and fragmented --
delivered in bits and pieces that required additional effort -- leaving them
uncertain or overwhelmed. These findings challenge assumptions of AI
superiority and motivate hybrid designs that integrate structured,
theory-driven content with targeted rehearsal, clear boundaries, and adaptive
scaffolds to address psychological barriers and support negotiation
preparedness.
