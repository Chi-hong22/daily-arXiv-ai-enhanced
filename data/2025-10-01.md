### [1] [LUMA: Low-Dimension Unified Motion Alignment with Dual-Path Anchoring for Text-to-Motion Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25304)
*Haozhe Jia,Wenshuo Chen,Yuqi Lin,Yang Yang,Lei Wang,Mang Ning,Bowen Tian,Songning Lai,Nanqian Jia,Yifan Chen,Yutao Yue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LUMA是一个基于扩散模型的文本到动作生成方法，通过双路径锚定机制解决语义对齐和运动伪影问题，在HumanML3D和KIT-ML数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于U-Net的扩散模型在文本到动作生成中存在语义不对齐和运动伪影问题，深层网络梯度衰减导致高级特征学习不足。

Method: 提出双路径锚定：时间域使用MoCLIP模型提供语义监督，频率域使用低频DCT分量提取语义信号，通过时间调制机制自适应融合两个锚点。

Result: 在HumanML3D和KIT-ML数据集上分别获得0.035和0.123的FID分数，收敛速度比基线快1.4倍。

Conclusion: LUMA通过双路径锚定机制有效解决了文本到动作生成中的语义对齐问题，实现了高效、可扩展的高保真动作生成。

Abstract: While current diffusion-based models, typically built on U-Net architectures,
have shown promising results on the text-to-motion generation task, they still
suffer from semantic misalignment and kinematic artifacts. Through analysis, we
identify severe gradient attenuation in the deep layers of the network as a key
bottleneck, leading to insufficient learning of high-level features. To address
this issue, we propose \textbf{LUMA} (\textit{\textbf{L}ow-dimension
\textbf{U}nified \textbf{M}otion \textbf{A}lignment}), a text-to-motion
diffusion model that incorporates dual-path anchoring to enhance semantic
alignment. The first path incorporates a lightweight MoCLIP model trained via
contrastive learning without relying on external data, offering semantic
supervision in the temporal domain. The second path introduces complementary
alignment signals in the frequency domain, extracted from low-frequency DCT
components known for their rich semantic content. These two anchors are
adaptively fused through a temporal modulation mechanism, allowing the model to
progressively transition from coarse alignment to fine-grained semantic
refinement throughout the denoising process. Experimental results on HumanML3D
and KIT-ML demonstrate that LUMA achieves state-of-the-art performance, with
FID scores of 0.035 and 0.123, respectively. Furthermore, LUMA accelerates
convergence by 1.4$\times$ compared to the baseline, making it an efficient and
scalable solution for high-fidelity text-to-motion generation.

### [2] [VisualOverload: Probing Visual Understanding of VLMs in Really Dense Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25339)
*Paul Gavrikov,Wei Lin,M. Jehanzeb Mirza,Soumya Jahagirdar,Muhammad Huzaifa,Sivan Doveh,Serena Yeung-Levy,James Glass,Hilde Kuehne*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisualOverload是一个新的视觉问答基准测试，包含2720个问题-答案对，专注于测试模型在密集场景中的基础视觉理解能力。该基准使用高分辨率公共领域绘画图像，包含多个角色、动作和复杂背景，挑战现有视觉语言模型在细节编码和推理方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试可能高估了视觉语言模型的性能，特别是在处理密集场景时。作者认为编码和推理细节仍然是VLMs面临的挑战，需要更严格的测试来评估其真实能力。

Method: 创建了VisualOverload基准测试，包含高分辨率公共领域绘画扫描图像，手动标注了6个任务类别的问题。测试了37个模型，包括最佳模型o3，并进行了详细的错误分析。

Result: 在37个测试模型中，最佳模型o3在最难测试集上仅达到19.6%的准确率，在所有问题上总体准确率为69.5%。错误分析揭示了多种失败模式，包括计数能力不足、OCR失败和逻辑不一致等问题。

Conclusion: VisualOverload暴露了当前视觉模型在密集场景理解方面的关键差距，为社区开发更好的模型提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Is basic visual understanding really solved in state-of-the-art VLMs? We
present VisualOverload, a slightly different visual question answering (VQA)
benchmark comprising 2,720 question-answer pairs, with privately held
ground-truth responses. Unlike prior VQA datasets that typically focus on near
global image understanding, VisualOverload challenges models to perform simple,
knowledge-free vision tasks in densely populated (or, overloaded) scenes. Our
dataset consists of high-resolution scans of public-domain paintings that are
populated with multiple figures, actions, and unfolding subplots set against
elaborately detailed backdrops. We manually annotated these images with
questions across six task categories to probe for a thorough understanding of
the scene. We hypothesize that current benchmarks overestimate the performance
of VLMs, and encoding and reasoning over details is still a challenging task
for them, especially if they are confronted with densely populated scenes.
Indeed, we observe that even the best model (o3) out of 37 tested models only
achieves 19.6% accuracy on our hardest test split and overall 69.5% accuracy on
all questions. Beyond a thorough evaluation, we complement our benchmark with
an error analysis that reveals multiple failure modes, including a lack of
counting skills, failure in OCR, and striking logical inconsistencies under
complex tasks. Altogether, VisualOverload exposes a critical gap in current
vision models and offers a crucial resource for the community to develop better
models.

### [3] [Editing Physiological Signals in Videos Using Latent Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25348)
*Tianwen Zhou,Akshay Paruchuri,Josef Spjut,Kaan Akşit*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于学习的框架，用于编辑视频中的生理信号（心率）同时保持视觉保真度，以解决面部视频中心率信号带来的隐私问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于摄像头的心率估计虽然提供了非接触式监测的便利性，但面部视频中的生命信号会暴露个人健康和情绪状态等敏感信息，引发严重的隐私担忧。

Method: 使用预训练的3D变分自编码器将输入视频编码到潜在空间，通过冻结的文本编码器嵌入目标心率提示，使用带自适应层归一化的可训练时空层进行融合，在解码器中应用特征级线性调制和微调输出层以避免生理信号退化。

Result: 在选定数据集上平均PSNR为38.96 dB，SSIM为0.98，使用最先进的rPPG估计器实现了平均心率调制误差10.00 bpm MAE和10.09% MAPE。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效保护视觉质量的同时准确调制生理信号，可用于匿名化真实视频中的生物特征信号或合成具有期望生命体征的真实视频。

Abstract: Camera-based physiological signal estimation provides a non-contact and
convenient means to monitor Heart Rate (HR). However, the presence of vital
signals in facial videos raises significant privacy concerns, as they can
reveal sensitive personal information related to the health and emotional
states of an individual. To address this, we propose a learned framework that
edits physiological signals in videos while preserving visual fidelity. First,
we encode an input video into a latent space via a pretrained 3D Variational
Autoencoder (3D VAE), while a target HR prompt is embedded through a frozen
text encoder. We fuse them using a set of trainable spatio-temporal layers with
Adaptive Layer Normalizations (AdaLN) to capture the strong temporal coherence
of remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals. We apply Feature-wise Linear
Modulation (FiLM) in the decoder with a fine-tuned output layer to avoid the
degradation of physiological signals during reconstruction, enabling accurate
physiological modulation in the reconstructed video. Empirical results show
that our method preserves visual quality with an average PSNR of 38.96 dB and
SSIM of 0.98 on selected datasets, while achieving an average HR modulation
error of 10.00 bpm MAE and 10.09% MAPE using a state-of-the-art rPPG estimator.
Our design's controllable HR editing is useful for applications such as
anonymizing biometric signals in real videos or synthesizing realistic videos
with desired vital signs.

### [4] [SpinBench: Perspective and Rotation as a Lens on Spatial Reasoning in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25390)
*Yuyou Zhang,Radu Corcodel,Chiori Hori,Anoop Cherian,Ding Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpinBench是一个用于评估视觉语言模型空间推理能力的诊断基准，重点关注视角转换下的空间推理能力，揭示了现有模型的系统性弱点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在空间推理方面存在不足，特别是视角转换能力。为了系统评估这一核心认知能力，需要构建一个认知基础扎实的诊断基准。

Method: 设计了细粒度的诊断类别，包括平移、旋转、物体相对姿态和视角变化，从简单的单物体任务逐步过渡到复杂的多物体视角转换场景。评估了37个最先进的专有和开源VLM。

Result: 发现模型存在强烈的自我中心偏差、旋转理解能力差、在对称和句法重构下表现不一致等问题。人类准确率达到91.2%，人类反应时间与VLM准确率呈强相关。

Conclusion: SpinBench为理解VLM的空间推理能力提供了关键见解，突显了它们在物理空间推理方面的主要差距，且基准捕获了人类和VLM共享的空间推理挑战。

Abstract: We present SpinBench, a cognitively grounded diagnostic benchmark for
evaluating spatial reasoning in vision language models (VLMs). SpinBench is
designed around the core challenge of spatial reasoning: perspective taking,
the ability to reason about how scenes and object relations change under
viewpoint transformation. Since perspective taking requires multiple cognitive
capabilities, such as recognizing objects across views, relative positions
grounding, and mentally simulating transformations, SpinBench introduces a set
of fine-grained diagnostic categories. Our categories target translation,
rotation, object relative pose, and viewpoint change, and are progressively
structured so that single-object simpler tasks scaffold toward the most
demanding multi-object perspective-taking setting. We evaluate 37
state-of-the-art VLMs, both proprietary and open source. Results reveal
systematic weaknesses: strong egocentric bias, poor rotational understanding,
and inconsistencies under symmetrical and syntactic reformulations. Scaling
analysis shows both smooth improvements and emergent capabilities. While human
subjects achieve high accuracy (91.2\%), task difficulty as measured by human
response time shows strong correlation with VLM accuracy, indicating that
SpinBench captures spatial reasoning challenges shared across humans and VLMs.
We believe SpinBench provides critical insights into spatial reasoning in VLMs
and highlights key gaps in their ability to reason about physical space. Our

### [5] [A Deep Learning Approach for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting of InSAR Ground Deformation in Eastern Ireland](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25393)
*Wendong Yao,Binhua Huang,Soumyabrata Dev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出多模态时空Transformer(MM-STT)框架，融合动态位移数据和静态物理先验，通过联合时空注意力机制统一处理多模态特征，在EGMS数据集上实现最先进的土地沉降预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ConvLSTM等方法难以建模长程依赖关系，且先前工作局限于单模态数据范式，无法充分利用多源信息进行高分辨率土地沉降预测。

Method: 开发多模态时空Transformer(MM-STT)，采用联合时空注意力机制统一处理动态位移数据和静态物理先验等多模态特征。

Result: 在EGMS数据集上建立新的最先进性能，相比包括STGCN和STAEformer在内的所有基线方法，长程预测RMSE降低了一个数量级。

Conclusion: 对于此类问题，架构固有的深度多模态融合能力对于实现变革性性能至关重要。

Abstract: Forecasting high-resolution land subsidence is a critical yet challenging
task due to its complex, non-linear dynamics. While standard architectures like
ConvLSTM often fail to model long-range dependencies, we argue that a more
fundamental limitation of prior work lies in the uni-modal data paradigm. To
address this, we propose the Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Transformer (MM-STT),
a novel framework that fuses dynamic displacement data with static physical
priors. Its core innovation is a joint spatio-temporal attention mechanism that
processes all multi-modal features in a unified manner. On the public EGMS
dataset, MM-STT establishes a new state-of-the-art, reducing the long-range
forecast RMSE by an order of magnitude compared to all baselines, including
SOTA methods like STGCN and STAEformer. Our results demonstrate that for this
class of problems, an architecture's inherent capacity for deep multi-modal
fusion is paramount for achieving transformative performance.

### [6] [DepthLM: Metric Depth From Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25413)
*Zhipeng Cai,Ching-Feng Yeh,Hu Xu,Zhuang Liu,Gregory Meyer,Xinjie Lei,Changsheng Zhao,Shang-Wen Li,Vikas Chandra,Yangyang Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs可以通过文本交互灵活处理视觉任务，但在3D理解方面表现不佳。DepthLM方法通过视觉提示和相机参数增强，使VLMs在深度估计任务中达到专家级精度，无需修改架构或损失函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的VLMs在从2D输入理解3D方面存在困难，而专门的视觉模型在深度估计等3D任务中能达到超人类精度。这引发了一个问题：VLMs能否在不改变架构或损失函数的情况下达到专家级精度？

Method: 使用基于文本的监督微调和稀疏标签，结合视觉提示和相机参数条件增强来解决像素参考和跨数据集相机模糊性问题。无需密集预测头或复杂的回归/正则化损失。

Result: DepthLM方法使VLMs在深度估计精度上超越了最先进VLMs 2倍以上，首次使VLMs与纯视觉模型相媲美。同时自然避免了过度平滑问题，在边界区域具有更少的飞点。

Conclusion: DepthLM的简单性使单个VLM能够覆盖超越度量深度的各种3D任务，证明了VLMs在3D理解方面的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) can flexibly address various vision tasks
through text interactions. Although successful in semantic understanding,
state-of-the-art VLMs including GPT-5 still struggle in understanding 3D from
2D inputs. On the other hand, expert pure vision models achieve super-human
accuracy in metric depth estimation, a key 3D understanding task. However, they
require task-specific architectures and losses. Such difference motivates us to
ask: Can VLMs reach expert-level accuracy without architecture or loss change?
We take per-pixel metric depth estimation as the representative task and show
that the answer is yes! Surprisingly, comprehensive analysis shows that
text-based supervised-finetuning with sparse labels is sufficient for VLMs to
unlock strong 3D understanding, no dense prediction head or complex
regression/regularization loss is needed. The bottleneck for VLMs lies actually
in pixel reference and cross-dataset camera ambiguity, which we address through
visual prompting and intrinsic-conditioned augmentation. With much smaller
models, our method DepthLM surpasses the accuracy of most advanced VLMs by over
2x, making VLMs for the first time comparable with pure vision models.
Interestingly, without explicit enforcement during training, VLMs trained with
DepthLM naturally avoids over-smoothing, having much fewer flying points at
boundary regions than pure vision models. The simplicity of DepthLM also
enables a single VLM to cover various 3D tasks beyond metric depth. Our code
and model will be released at the link below.

### [7] [Bayesian Transformer for Pan-Arctic Sea Ice Concentration Mapping and Uncertainty Estimation using Sentinel-1, RCM, and AMSR2 Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25437)
*Mabel Heffring,Lincoln Linlin Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种新颖的贝叶斯Transformer方法，用于泛北极海冰浓度制图和不确定性量化，结合Sentinel-1、RCM和AMSR2数据，通过全局-局部模块和决策级融合提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率泛北极海冰制图及其不确定性量化对海冰浓度制图至关重要，但由于冰特征细微、模型不确定性和数据异质性等挑战而难以实现。

Method: 设计高分辨率Transformer模型，包含全局和局部模块以更好识别海冰模式差异；提出贝叶斯扩展版本，将参数作为随机变量处理；在决策级融合三种不同类型数据。

Result: 在2021年9月的泛北极数据集上测试，相比其他不确定性量化方法，该模型能够获得高分辨率海冰浓度图和稳健的不确定性图。

Conclusion: 所提出的贝叶斯Transformer方法能够有效解决泛北极海冰制图中的关键挑战，实现高精度海冰浓度映射和可靠的不确定性量化。

Abstract: Although high-resolution mapping of Pan-Arctic sea ice with reliable
corresponding uncertainty is essential for operational sea ice concentration
(SIC) charting, it is a difficult task due to some key challenges, e.g., the
subtle nature of ice signature features, model uncertainty, and data
heterogeneity. This letter presents a novel Bayesian Transformer approach for
Pan-Arctic SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification using Sentinel-1,
RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), and Advanced Microwave Scanning
Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) data. First, to improve feature extraction, we design a
novel high-resolution Transformer model with both global and local modules that
can better discern the subtle differences in sea ice patterns. Second, to
improve uncertainty quantification, we design a Bayesian extension of the
proposed Transformer model, treating its parameters as random variables to more
effectively capture uncertainties. Third, to address data heterogeneity, we
fuse three different data types (Sentinel-1, RCM, and AMSR2) at decision-level
to improve both SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification. The proposed
approach is tested on Pan-Arctic datasets from September 2021, and the results
demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve both high-resolution SIC maps
and robust uncertainty maps compared to other uncertainty quantification
approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一种基于路边摄像头和LiDAR传感器融合的车辆检测与定位框架，通过卡尔曼滤波融合策略显著提高轨迹精度，在模拟中减少纵向误差达70%，在真实工作区验证中表现出鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于基础设施的感知系统在实际部署中面临的视角失真、复杂几何、遮挡和成本等障碍，为高风险路段（如工作区）提供安全改进方案。

Method: 集成路边摄像头和LiDAR传感器到协同仿真环境，采用基于卡尔曼滤波的后期融合策略来增强轨迹一致性和准确性。

Result: 模拟结果显示融合算法相比单个传感器减少纵向误差达70%，横向精度保持在1-3米内；现场验证表明融合轨迹能紧密匹配真实车辆路径，即使单个传感器数据间歇或降级。

Conclusion: 基于卡尔曼滤波的传感器融合能可靠补偿单个传感器限制，提供精确鲁棒的车辆跟踪能力，为复杂交通环境中部署基础设施支持的多传感器系统提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Infrastructure-based sensing and real-time trajectory generation show promise
for improving safety in high-risk roadway segments such as work zones, yet
practical deployments are hindered by perspective distortion, complex geometry,
occlusions, and costs. This study tackles these barriers by integrating
roadside camera and LiDAR sensors into a cosimulation environment to develop a
scalable, cost-effective vehicle detection and localization framework, and
employing a Kalman Filter-based late fusion strategy to enhance trajectory
consistency and accuracy. In simulation, the fusion algorithm reduced
longitudinal error by up to 70 percent compared to individual sensors while
preserving lateral accuracy within 1 to 3 meters. Field validation in an active
work zone, using LiDAR, a radar-camera rig, and RTK-GPS as ground truth,
demonstrated that the fused trajectories closely match real vehicle paths, even
when single-sensor data are intermittent or degraded. These results confirm
that KF based sensor fusion can reliably compensate for individual sensor
limitations, providing precise and robust vehicle tracking capabilities. Our
approach thus offers a practical pathway to deploy infrastructure-enabled
multi-sensor systems for proactive safety measures in complex traffic
environments.

TL;DR: 提出了Forensic-Chat方法，通过"先观察后推理"的新范式解决MLLMs在AI生成图像检测中的性能不佳问题，强调增强对伪造痕迹的感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在AI生成图像检测中表现不佳，根本原因在于视觉编码器主要针对语义识别优化，对低级别伪造痕迹不敏感，且微调数据格式与预训练分布不匹配导致知识遗忘。

Method: 提出Forensic-Chat方法，采用"先观察后推理"范式，首先训练MLLMs感知伪造痕迹，增强其伪造感知能力，然后基于实际观察进行推理。同时提出ExplainFake-Bench评估基准。

Result: 大量实验表明该方法在泛化性和可解释性方面具有优越性，能够提供真正可靠的可解释性。

Conclusion: 通过增强MLLMs的伪造感知能力并采用合适的训练范式，可以显著提升AI生成图像检测的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Detecting AI-generated images with multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
has gained increasing attention, due to their rich world knowledge,
common-sense reasoning, and potential for explainability. However, naively
applying those MLLMs for detection often leads to suboptimal performance. We
argue that the root of this failure lies in a fundamental mismatch: MLLMs are
asked to reason about fakes before they can truly see them. First, they do not
really see: existing MLLMs' vision encoders are primarily optimized for
semantic-oriented recognition rather than the perception of low-level signals,
leaving them insensitive to subtle forgery traces. Without access to reliable
perceptual evidence, the model grounds its judgment on incomplete and limited
visual observations. Second, existing finetuning data for detection typically
uses narrow, instruction-style formats, which diverge sharply from the diverse,
heterogeneous distributions seen in pretraining. In the absence of meaningful
visual cues, the model therefore exploits these linguistic shortcuts, resulting
in catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge (even the basic dialogue
capabilities). In response, we advocate for a new paradigm: seeing before
reasoning. We propose that MLLMs should first be trained to perceive
artifacts-strengthening their artifact-aware visual perception-so that
subsequent reasoning is grounded in actual observations. We therefore propose
Forensic-Chat, a generalizable, explainable, and still-conversational (for
multi-round dialogue) assistant for fake image detection. We also propose
ExplainFake-Bench, a benchmark tailored for the evaluation of the MLLM's
explainability for image forensics from five key aspects. Extensive experiments
show its superiority of generalization and genuinely reliable explainability.

### [10] [DeepFake Detection in Dyadic Video Calls using Point of Gaze Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25503)
*Odin Kohler,Rahul Vijaykumar,Masudul H. Imtiaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用视线追踪技术检测视频会议中实时深度伪造攻击的方法，通过分析视线模式来识别深度伪造视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度伪造技术的发展，恶意行为者开始在视频会议中进行实时钓鱼攻击。深度伪造无法模拟真实人类在对话中的微妙非语言交流，特别是视线模式。

Method: 基于可解释的特征构建模型，这些特征经过对二元对话中视线模式的仔细研究后选择。利用恶意行为者视频流中的估计视线来检测深度伪造。

Result: 在自建的新数据集上测试，达到了82%的准确率。

Conclusion: 这是首个利用视线点追踪进行深度伪造检测的方法，为实时深度伪造检测提供了新的生物特征信息途径。

Abstract: With recent advancements in deepfake technology, it is now possible to
generate convincing deepfakes in real-time. Unfortunately, malicious actors
have started to use this new technology to perform real-time phishing attacks
during video meetings. The nature of a video call allows access to what the
deepfake is ``seeing,'' that is, the screen displayed to the malicious actor.
Using this with the estimated gaze from the malicious actors streamed video
enables us to estimate where the deepfake is looking on screen, the point of
gaze. Because the point of gaze during conversations is not random and is
instead used as a subtle nonverbal communicator, it can be used to detect
deepfakes, which are not capable of mimicking this subtle nonverbal
communication. This paper proposes a real-time deepfake detection method
adapted to this genre of attack, utilizing previously unavailable biometric
information. We built our model based on explainable features selected after
careful review of research on gaze patterns during dyadic conversations. We
then test our model on a novel dataset of our creation, achieving an accuracy
of 82\%. This is the first reported method to utilize point-of-gaze tracking
for deepfake detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉的6-DoF物体姿态估计算法，专门用于火星样本返回任务中的受限硬件环境，通过自定义渲染器和新的模板匹配度量实现鲁棒姿态估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决火星样本返回任务中机器人手臂在严重硬件约束下对多个目标物体进行低间隙拾取和插入时的定位问题。

Method: 使用自定义渲染器和专门为边缘域设计的新模板匹配度量，仅需低保真、无纹理的3D模型作为输入。

Result: 在合成数据集、地球物理测试台和火星实地图像上的广泛评估表明，该方法在计算和内存受限的定位任务中，在鲁棒性和准确性方面均优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法为通用硬件上的廉价可靠定位开辟了新的可能性。

Abstract: We consider the problem of vision-based 6-DoF object pose estimation in the
context of the notional Mars Sample Return campaign, in which a robotic arm
would need to localize multiple objects of interest for low-clearance pickup
and insertion, under severely constrained hardware. We propose a novel
localization algorithm leveraging a custom renderer together with a new
template matching metric tailored to the edge domain to achieve robust pose
estimation using only low-fidelity, textureless 3D models as inputs. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic datasets as well as from physical testbeds on Earth
and in situ Mars imagery shows that our method consistently beats the state of
the art in compute and memory-constrained localization, both in terms of
robustness and accuracy, in turn enabling new possibilities for cheap and
reliable localization on general-purpose hardware.

### [12] [LLM-RG: Referential Grounding in Outdoor Scenarios using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25528)
*Pranav Saxena,Avigyan Bhattacharya,Ji Zhang,Wenshan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLM-RG是一个结合视觉语言模型和大型语言模型的混合管道，用于解决户外驾驶场景中的指称接地问题，在Talk2Car基准测试中显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 户外驾驶场景中的指称接地具有挑战性，因为场景变化大、视觉相似物体多、动态元素复杂，使得解析自然语言指称（如"右边的黑色汽车"）变得困难。

Method: 提出LLM-RG混合管道：使用LLM提取相关对象类型和属性，检测候选区域，用VLM生成丰富的视觉描述符，然后将这些描述符与空间元数据结合成自然语言提示，输入LLM进行链式推理以识别指称对象的边界框。

Result: 在Talk2Car基准测试中，LLM-RG相比基于LLM和VLM的基线方法取得了显著提升，消融实验显示添加3D空间线索能进一步改善接地效果。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，以零样本方式应用的VLM和LLM在稳健的户外指称接地中具有互补优势。

Abstract: Referential grounding in outdoor driving scenes is challenging due to large
scene variability, many visually similar objects, and dynamic elements that
complicate resolving natural-language references (e.g., "the black car on the
right"). We propose LLM-RG, a hybrid pipeline that combines off-the-shelf
vision-language models for fine-grained attribute extraction with large
language models for symbolic reasoning. LLM-RG processes an image and a
free-form referring expression by using an LLM to extract relevant object types
and attributes, detecting candidate regions, generating rich visual descriptors
with a VLM, and then combining these descriptors with spatial metadata into
natural-language prompts that are input to an LLM for chain-of-thought
reasoning to identify the referent's bounding box. Evaluated on the Talk2Car
benchmark, LLM-RG yields substantial gains over both LLM and VLM-based
baselines. Additionally, our ablations show that adding 3D spatial cues further
improves grounding. Our results demonstrate the complementary strengths of VLMs
and LLMs, applied in a zero-shot manner, for robust outdoor referential
grounding.

### [13] [VISOR++: Universal Visual Inputs based Steering for Large Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25533)
*Ravikumar Balakrishnan,Mansi Phute*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VISOR++是一种通过优化视觉输入来实现视觉语言模型行为控制的方法，无需运行时访问模型内部，仅通过插入特定图像即可实现行为引导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有行为控制方法存在局限性：系统提示容易被用户指令覆盖，基于激活的引导向量需要侵入式运行时模型访问，无法用于API服务和闭源模型。需要开发跨模型通用的行为控制方法。

Method: 通过生成优化的视觉输入（VISOR++图像）来诱导目标激活模式，这些图像可以针对单个模型或模型集合进行优化，实现行为引导而无需运行时模型访问。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7B和IDEFICS2-8B等模型上，VISOR++图像在拒绝、奉承和生存本能三个对齐方向上达到了与引导向量相当的性能。在未见模型（包括开源和闭源模型）上也能实现行为偏移，同时在14,000个MMLU评估任务上保持99.9%的性能。

Conclusion: VISOR++提供了一种部署无关的行为控制方法，仅通过视觉输入即可实现有效的模型行为引导，为视觉语言模型的安全部署提供了新途径。

Abstract: As Vision Language Models (VLMs) are deployed across safety-critical
applications, understanding and controlling their behavioral patterns has
become increasingly important. Existing behavioral control methods face
significant limitations: system prompting approaches could easily be overridden
by user instructions, while applying activation-based steering vectors requires
invasive runtime access to model internals, precluding deployment with
API-based services and closed-source models. Finding steering methods that
transfer across multiple VLMs is still an open area of research. To this end,
we introduce universal visual input based steering for output redirection
(VISOR++), to achieve behavioral control through optimized visual inputs alone.
We demonstrate that a single VISOR++ image can be generated for an ensemble of
VLMs to emulate each of their steering vectors. By crafting universal visual
inputs that induce target activation patterns, VISOR++ eliminates the need for
runtime model access while remaining deployment-agnostic. This means that when
an underlying model supports multimodal capability, model behaviors can be
steered by inserting an image input replacing runtime steering vector based
interventions. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of the VISOR++ images on
open-access models such as LLaVA-1.5-7B and IDEFICS2-8B along three alignment
directions: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. Both the model-specific
steering images and the jointly optimized images achieve performance parity
closely following that of steering vectors for both positive and negative
steering tasks. We also show the promise of VISOR++ images in achieving
directional behavioral shifts for unseen models including both open-access and
closed-access ones. Furthermore, VISOR++ images are able to preserve 99.9%
performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU evaluation tasks.

Motivation: 解决当前视觉语言模型强化学习训练依赖人工标注数据集的问题，降低训练成本，促进实际部署。

Method: 提出战略自博弈框架，让模型在'谁是卧底'式游戏中扮演不同角色进行推理；引入迭代自博弈策略优化算法，结合自博弈和可验证奖励的强化学习。

Conclusion: Vision-Zero证明了无需人工标注的自增强框架的有效性，为视觉语言模型的实用化部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Although reinforcement learning (RL) can effectively enhance the reasoning
capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs), current methods remain heavily
dependent on labor-intensive datasets that require extensive manual
construction and verification, leading to extremely high training costs and
consequently constraining the practical deployment of VLMs. To address this
challenge, we propose Vision-Zero, a domain-agnostic framework enabling VLM
self-improvement through competitive visual games generated from arbitrary
image pairs. Specifically, Vision-Zero encompasses three main attributes: (1)
Strategic Self-Play Framework: Vision-Zero trains VLMs in "Who Is the
Spy"-style games, where the models engage in strategic reasoning and actions
across multiple roles. Through interactive gameplay, models autonomously
generate their training data without human annotation. (2) Gameplay from
Arbitrary Images: Unlike existing gamified frameworks, Vision-Zero can generate
games from arbitrary images, thereby enhancing the model's reasoning ability
across diverse domains and showing strong generalization to different tasks. We
demonstrate this versatility using three distinct types of image datasets:
CLEVR-based synthetic scenes, charts, and real-world images. (3) Sustainable
Performance Gain: We introduce Iterative Self-Play Policy Optimization
(Iterative-SPO), a novel training algorithm that alternates between Self-Play
and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), mitigating the
performance plateau often seen in self-play-only training and achieving
sustained long-term improvements. Despite using label-free data, Vision-Zero
achieves state-of-the-art performance on reasoning, chart question answering,
and vision-centric understanding tasks, surpassing other annotation-based
methods. Models and code has been released at

Motivation: 脉络膜痣有恶变为黑色素瘤的风险，早期检测至关重要。现有AI方法在眼底图像分割中面临挑战，特别是对于非专业医生。数据集分辨率低、标注不一致限制了分割模型效果。

Method: 结合数学/聚类分割模型与U-Net的混合方法，利用两种方法的优势，减少对大规模训练数据的依赖。

Abstract: Choroidal nevi are common benign pigmented lesions in the eye, with a small
risk of transforming into melanoma. Early detection is critical to improving
survival rates, but misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis can lead to poor
outcomes. Despite advancements in AI-based image analysis, diagnosing choroidal
nevi in colour fundus images remains challenging, particularly for clinicians
without specialized expertise. Existing datasets often suffer from low
resolution and inconsistent labelling, limiting the effectiveness of
segmentation models. This paper addresses the challenge of achieving precise
segmentation of fundus lesions, a critical step toward developing robust
diagnostic tools. While deep learning models like U-Net have demonstrated
effectiveness, their accuracy heavily depends on the quality and quantity of
annotated data. Previous mathematical/clustering segmentation methods, though
accurate, required extensive human input, making them impractical for medical
applications. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines
mathematical/clustering segmentation models with insights from U-Net,
leveraging the strengths of both methods. This hybrid model improves accuracy,
reduces the need for large-scale training data, and achieves significant
performance gains on high-resolution fundus images. The proposed model achieves
a Dice coefficient of 89.7% and an IoU of 80.01% on 1024*1024 fundus images,
outperforming the Attention U-Net model, which achieved 51.3% and 34.2%,
respectively. It also demonstrated better generalizability on external
datasets. This work forms a part of a broader effort to develop a decision
support system for choroidal nevus diagnosis, with potential applications in
automated lesion annotation to enhance the speed and accuracy of diagnosis and
monitoring.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
cross-domain capabilities, yet their proficiency in specialized scientific
fields like marine biology remains underexplored. In this work, we
systematically evaluate state-of-the-art MLLMs and reveal significant
limitations in their ability to perform fine-grained recognition of fish
species, with the best open-source models achieving less than 10\% accuracy.
This task is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems under anthropogenic

a lack of domain knowledge, we introduce FishNet++, a large-scale, multimodal
benchmark. FishNet++ significantly extends existing resources with 35,133
textual descriptions for multimodal learning, 706,426 key-point annotations for

Motivation: 现有的ViG框架中，节点-邻居特征聚合方法需要针对特定架构进行优化，缺乏一种能够有效捕捉复杂节点-邻居关系的通用聚合方法。

Method: 提出交叉注意力聚合方法，其中查询投影来自节点，键投影来自其邻居；并构建了使用该聚合方案进行非局部消息传递的AttentionViG架构。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K基准测试中实现了SOTA性能；在MS COCO 2017的目标检测和实例分割任务以及ADE20K的语义分割任务中表现出良好的迁移性；在保持与先前视觉GNN架构相当的FLOPs下实现了竞争性精度。

Conclusion: 所提出的交叉注意力聚合方法不仅实现了强大的性能，而且保持了效率，为视觉图神经网络提供了一种有效的特征聚合方案。

Abstract: Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViGs) have demonstrated promising performance
in image recognition tasks against Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and
Vision Transformers (ViTs). An essential part of the ViG framework is the
node-neighbor feature aggregation method. Although various graph convolution
methods, such as Max-Relative, EdgeConv, GIN, and GraphSAGE, have been
explored, a versatile aggregation method that effectively captures complex
node-neighbor relationships without requiring architecture-specific refinements
is needed. To address this gap, we propose a cross-attention-based aggregation
method in which the query projections come from the node, while the key
projections come from its neighbors. Additionally, we introduce a novel
architecture called AttentionViG that uses the proposed cross-attention
aggregation scheme to conduct non-local message passing. We evaluated the image
recognition performance of AttentionViG on the ImageNet-1K benchmark, where it
achieved SOTA performance. Additionally, we assessed its transferability to
downstream tasks, including object detection and instance segmentation on MS
COCO 2017, as well as semantic segmentation on ADE20K. Our results demonstrate
that the proposed method not only achieves strong performance, but also
maintains efficiency, delivering competitive accuracy with comparable FLOPs to
prior vision GNN architectures.

TL;DR: 提出了MetaChest数据集用于医学图像的小样本学习，比较了迁移学习和ProtoNet在小样本多标签分类任务中的表现，发现迁移学习方法表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像标注数据稀缺，传统小样本学习假设所有类别都是新的，但医学应用需要同时学习新类别并利用已有知识，这更符合广义小样本分类场景。

Method: 构建了包含479,215张胸部X光片的MetaChest数据集，设计了标准小样本分类的元集划分和多标签episode生成算法，评估了迁移学习和ProtoNet扩展方法。

Result: 增加每个episode的类别数和每个类别的训练样本数能提升性能；迁移学习方法持续优于ProtoNet扩展；高分辨率图像提高精度但增加计算成本；高效模型架构可达到与大模型相当的性能但资源需求显著降低。

Conclusion: 迁移学习在小样本医学图像分类中表现优异，高效模型架构可在保持性能的同时大幅降低计算资源需求，为医学图像分析提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The limited availability of annotated data presents a major challenge for
applying deep learning methods to medical image analysis. Few-shot learning
methods aim to recognize new classes from only a small number of labeled
examples. These methods are typically studied under the standard few-shot
learning setting, where all classes in a task are new. However, medical
applications such as pathology classification from chest X-rays often require
learning new classes while simultaneously leveraging knowledge of previously
known ones, a scenario more closely aligned with generalized few-shot
classification. Despite its practical relevance, few-shot learning has been
scarcely studied in this context. In this work, we present MetaChest, a
large-scale dataset of 479,215 chest X-rays collected from four public
databases. MetaChest includes a meta-set partition specifically designed for
standard few-shot classification, as well as an algorithm for generating
multi-label episodes. We conduct extensive experiments evaluating both a
standard transfer learning approach and an extension of ProtoNet across a wide
range of few-shot multi-label classification tasks. Our results demonstrate
that increasing the number of classes per episode and the number of training
examples per class improves classification performance. Notably, the transfer
learning approach consistently outperforms the ProtoNet extension, despite not
being tailored for few-shot learning. We also show that higher-resolution
images improve accuracy at the cost of additional computation, while efficient
model architectures achieve comparable performance to larger models with
significantly reduced resource requirements.

Motivation: 现有医学图像分割模型通常针对单一任务、模态或器官进行训练，与临床实践中专家综合运用多种知识的实际情况不符。

Method: 将异构知识源编码为双提示表示：1-D稀疏提示定义分割内容，2-D密集提示指示关注区域，通过混合专家解码器动态路由。

Result: 在18个公共数据集上的实验表明，K-Prism在语义分割、上下文分割和交互分割设置下均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: K-Prism成功模拟了临床实践的灵活性，为医学图像分割提供了一个统一且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is fundamental to clinical decision-making, yet
existing models remain fragmented. They are usually trained on single knowledge
sources and specific to individual tasks, modalities, or organs. This
fragmentation contrasts sharply with clinical practice, where experts
seamlessly integrate diverse knowledge: anatomical priors from training,
exemplar-based reasoning from reference cases, and iterative refinement through
real-time interaction. We present $\textbf{K-Prism}$, a unified segmentation
framework that mirrors this clinical flexibility by systematically integrating
three knowledge paradigms: (i) $\textit{semantic priors}$ learned from
annotated datasets, (ii) $\textit{in-context knowledge}$ from few-shot
reference examples, and (iii) $\textit{interactive feedback}$ from user inputs
like clicks or scribbles. Our key insight is that these heterogeneous knowledge
sources can be encoded into a dual-prompt representation: 1-D sparse prompts
defining $\textit{what}$ to segment and 2-D dense prompts indicating
$\textit{where}$ to attend, which are then dynamically routed through a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) decoder. This design enables flexible switching
between paradigms and joint training across diverse tasks without architectural
modifications. Comprehensive experiments on 18 public datasets spanning diverse
modalities (CT, MRI, X-ray, pathology, ultrasound, etc.) demonstrate that
K-Prism achieves state-of-the-art performance across semantic, in-context, and
interactive segmentation settings. Code will be released upon publication.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效、鲁棒的LiDAR点云着色方案，特别适用于低光照环境，简化了系统设置并实现了实时处理。

Abstract: In recent years, the fusion of camera data with LiDAR measurements has
emerged as a powerful approach to enhance spatial understanding. This study
introduces a novel, hardware-agnostic methodology that generates colourised
point clouds from mechanical LiDAR using multiple camera inputs, providing
complete 360-degree coverage. The primary innovation lies in its robustness
under low-light conditions, achieved through the integration of a low-light
image enhancement module within the fusion pipeline. The system requires
initial calibration to determine intrinsic camera parameters, followed by
automatic computation of the geometric transformation between the LiDAR and
cameras, removing the need for specialised calibration targets and streamlining
the setup. The data processing framework uses colour correction to ensure
uniformity across camera feeds before fusion. The algorithm was tested using a
Velodyne Puck Hi-Res LiDAR and a four-camera configuration. The optimised
software achieved real-time performance and reliable colourisation even under
very low illumination, successfully recovering scene details that would
otherwise remain undetectable.

Abstract: We perceive our surroundings with an active focus, paying more attention to
regions of interest, such as the shelf labels in a grocery store. When it comes
to scene reconstruction, this human perception trait calls for spatially
varying degrees of detail ready for closer inspection in critical regions,
preferably reconstructed on demand. While recent works in 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) achieve fast, generalizable reconstruction from sparse views, their
uniform resolution output leads to high computational costs unscalable to
high-resolution training. As a result, they cannot leverage available images at
their original high resolution to reconstruct details. Per-scene optimization
methods reconstruct finer details with adaptive density control, yet require
dense observations and lengthy offline optimization. To bridge the gap between
the prohibitive cost of high-resolution holistic reconstructions and the user
needs for localized fine details, we propose the problem of localized
high-resolution reconstruction via on-demand Gaussian densification. Given a
low-resolution 3DGS reconstruction, the goal is to learn a generalizable
network that densifies the initial 3DGS to capture fine details in a
user-specified local region of interest (RoI), based on sparse high-resolution
observations of the RoI. This formulation avoids the high cost and redundancy
of uniformly high-resolution reconstructions and fully leverages
high-resolution captures in critical regions. We propose GaussianLens, a
feed-forward densification framework that fuses multi-modal information from
the initial 3DGS and multi-view images. We further design a pixel-guided
densification mechanism that effectively captures details under large
resolution increases. Experiments demonstrate our method's superior performance
in local fine detail reconstruction and strong scalability to images of up to
$1024\times1024$ resolution.

Abstract: Vision-threatening eye diseases pose a major global health burden, with
timely diagnosis limited by workforce shortages and restricted access to
specialized care. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise
for medical image interpretation, advancing MLLMs for ophthalmology is hindered
by the lack of comprehensive benchmark datasets suitable for evaluating
generative models. We present a large-scale multimodal ophthalmology benchmark
comprising 32,633 instances with multi-granular annotations across 12 common
ophthalmic conditions and 5 imaging modalities. The dataset integrates imaging,
anatomical structures, demographics, and free-text annotations, supporting
anatomical structure recognition, disease screening, disease staging, and
demographic prediction for bias evaluation. This work extends our preliminary
LMOD benchmark with three major enhancements: (1) nearly 50% dataset expansion
with substantial enlargement of color fundus photography; (2) broadened task
coverage including binary disease diagnosis, multi-class diagnosis, severity
classification with international grading standards, and demographic
prediction; and (3) systematic evaluation of 24 state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our
evaluations reveal both promise and limitations. Top-performing models achieved
~58% accuracy in disease screening under zero-shot settings, and performance
remained suboptimal for challenging tasks like disease staging. We will
publicly release the dataset, curation pipeline, and leaderboard to potentially
advance ophthalmic AI applications and reduce the global burden of
vision-threatening diseases.

Motivation: 现有跨视角物体地理定位方法大多基于锚框，这种方法受到预定义锚框的限制。为了消除这种依赖，需要一种更灵活的无锚框方法。

Method: AFGeo直接为每个像素预测到真实框的四个方向偏移（左、右、上、下），结合高斯位置编码建模查询图像中的点击点不确定性，并引入跨视角物体关联模块来关联不同视角下的同一物体及其周围环境。

Result: 该方法在基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，同时模型轻量且计算高效。

Conclusion: AFGeo通过无锚框定位范式，结合高斯位置编码和跨视角物体关联模块，有效解决了跨视角物体地理定位问题，在性能和效率方面都表现出色。

Abstract: Most existing cross-view object geo-localization approaches adopt
anchor-based paradigm. Although effective, such methods are inherently
constrained by predefined anchors. To eliminate this dependency, we first
propose an anchor-free formulation for cross-view object geo-localization,
termed AFGeo. AFGeo directly predicts the four directional offsets (left,
right, top, bottom) to the ground-truth box for each pixel, thereby localizing
the object without any predefined anchors. To obtain a more robust spatial
prior, AFGeo incorporates Gaussian Position Encoding (GPE) to model the click
point in the query image, mitigating the uncertainty of object position that
challenges object localization in cross-view scenarios. In addition, AFGeo
incorporates a Cross-view Object Association Module (CVOAM) that relates the
same object and its surrounding context across viewpoints, enabling reliable
localization under large cross-view appearance gaps. By adopting an anchor-free
localization paradigm that integrates GPE and CVOAM with minimal parameter
overhead, our model is both lightweight and computationally efficient,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Despite their consistent performance improvements, cross-modal retrieval
models (e.g., CLIP) show degraded performances with retrieving keys composed of
fused image-text modality (e.g., Wikipedia pages with both images and text). To
address this critical challenge, multimodal retrieval has been recently
explored to develop a unified single retrieval model capable of retrieving keys
across diverse modality combinations. A common approach involves constructing
new composed sets of image-text triplets (e.g., retrieving a pair of image and
text given a query image). However, such an approach requires careful curation
to ensure the dataset quality and fails to generalize to unseen modality
combinations. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes Generalized
Contrastive Learning (GCL), a novel loss formulation that improves multimodal
retrieval performance without the burdensome need for new dataset curation.
Specifically, GCL operates by enforcing contrastive learning across all
modalities within a mini-batch, utilizing existing image-caption paired
datasets to learn a unified representation space. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of GCL by showing consistent performance improvements on
off-the-shelf multimodal retrieval models (e.g., VISTA, CLIP, and TinyCLIP)
using the M-BEIR, MMEB, and CoVR benchmarks.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) traditionally require large amounts of
data to train models with good performance. However, data collection is an
expensive process, both in time and resources. Generated synthetic images are a
good alternative, with video games producing realistic 3D models. This paper
aims to determine whether images extracted from a video game can be effectively
used to train a CNN to detect real-life truck axles. Three different databases
were created, with real-life and synthetic trucks, to provide training and
testing examples for three different You Only Look Once (YOLO) architectures.
Results were evaluated based on four metrics: recall, precision, F1-score, and
mean Average Precision (mAP). To evaluate the statistical significance of the
results, the Mann-Whitney U test was also applied to the resulting mAP of all
models. Synthetic images from trucks extracted from a video game proved to be a
reliable source of training data, contributing to the performance of all
networks. The highest mAP score reached 99\%. Results indicate that synthetic
images can be used to train neural networks, providing a reliable, low-cost
data source for extracting knowledge.

*Kaiyu Li,Zixuan Jiang,Xiangyong Cao,Jiayu Wang,Yuchen Xiao,Deyu Meng,Zhi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Geo-DLC任务，即遥感图像的对象级细粒度描述，构建了DE-Dataset数据集和DE-Benchmark评估套件，并开发了DescribeEarth模型，在遥感图像细粒度描述任务上优于现有通用多模态大模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遥感图像描述研究主要关注图像级别，缺乏对象级细粒度解释，无法充分利用遥感图像中丰富的语义和结构信息。

Method: 构建DE-Dataset数据集（25个类别，261,806个标注实例）；提出DE-Benchmark评估套件（基于LLM辅助问答）；开发DescribeEarth模型，集成尺度自适应聚焦策略和领域引导融合模块。

Result: DescribeEarth模型在DE-Benchmark上持续优于最先进的通用MLLMs，在事实准确性、描述丰富性和语法正确性方面表现优异，特别是在捕捉内在对象特征和周围环境属性方面。

Conclusion: Geo-DLC任务和DescribeEarth模型为遥感图像细粒度描述提供了有效解决方案，所有数据、代码和权重均已开源。

Abstract: Automated textual description of remote sensing images is crucial for
unlocking their full potential in diverse applications, from environmental
monitoring to urban planning and disaster management. However, existing studies
in remote sensing image captioning primarily focus on the image level, lacking
object-level fine-grained interpretation, which prevents the full utilization
and transformation of the rich semantic and structural information contained in
remote sensing images. To address this limitation, we propose Geo-DLC, a novel
task of object-level fine-grained image captioning for remote sensing. To
support this task, we construct DE-Dataset, a large-scale dataset contains 25
categories and 261,806 annotated instances with detailed descriptions of object
attributes, relationships, and contexts. Furthermore, we introduce
DE-Benchmark, a LLM-assisted question-answering based evaluation suite designed
to systematically measure model capabilities on the Geo-DLC task. We also
present DescribeEarth, a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) architecture
explicitly designed for Geo-DLC, which integrates a scale-adaptive focal
strategy and a domain-guided fusion module leveraging remote sensing
vision-language model features to encode high-resolution details and remote
sensing category priors while maintaining global context. Our DescribeEarth
model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art general MLLMs on DE-Benchmark,
demonstrating superior factual accuracy, descriptive richness, and grammatical
soundness, particularly in capturing intrinsic object features and surrounding
environmental attributes across simple, complex, and even out-of-distribution
remote sensing scenarios. All data, code and weights are released at

TL;DR: 提出基于YOLO的深度学习模型用于工业制造中的自动缺陷检测，结合ConSinGAN进行数据增强，YOLOv9模型在金属板缺陷检测中表现最佳，准确率达91.3%，检测时间146ms。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决工业制造中传统缺陷检测方法耗时耗力的问题，特别是针对金属板表面和孔洞缺陷的自动化检测需求。

Method: 使用YOLOv3、v4、v7、v9四个版本结合ConSinGAN进行数据增强，在金属板图像数据集上训练缺陷检测模型。

Result: YOLOv9模型性能最优，准确率91.3%，检测时间146ms，成功集成到制造硬件和SCADA系统中建立自动化光学检测系统。

Conclusion: 提出的YOLOv9模型结合数据增强方法有效解决了工业制造中的缺陷检测问题，具有良好的实用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a YOLO-based deep learning (DL) model for automatic
defect detection to solve the time-consuming and labor-intensive tasks in
industrial manufacturing. In our experiments, the images of metal sheets are
used as the dataset for training the YOLO model to detect the defects on the
surfaces and in the holes of metal sheets. However, the lack of metal sheet
images significantly degrades the performance of detection accuracy. To address
this issue, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a considerable amount of data.
Four versions of the YOLO model (i.e., YOLOv3, v4, v7, and v9) are combined
with the ConSinGAN for data augmentation. The proposed YOLOv9 model with
ConSinGAN outperforms the other YOLO models with an accuracy of 91.3%, and a
detection time of 146 ms. The proposed YOLOv9 model is integrated into
manufacturing hardware and a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
system to establish a practical automated optical inspection (AOI) system.
Additionally, the proposed automated defect detection is easily applied to
other components in industrial manufacturing.

*Shiyu Wu,Shuyan Li,Jing Li,Jing Liu,Yequan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了OmniDFA框架，用于AI生成图像的开放集少样本源模型识别，同时构建了包含117万张图像的大型数据集OmniFake。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI生成图像检测和源模型识别中的挑战，包括生成模型结构多样性、现有方法过拟合特定伪造特征、以及缺乏大规模分类合成数据集的问题。

Method: 提出开放集少样本源识别新范式，开发OmniDFA框架，既能评估图像真实性，又能以少样本方式确定合成来源，并构建包含45个不同生成模型的OmniFake数据集。

Result: OmniDFA在开放集识别方面表现出色，在AIGI检测上达到最先进的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 该工作为AIGI检测和识别提供了有效的解决方案和丰富的基础资源，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: AI-generated image (AIGI) detection and source model attribution remain
central challenges in combating deepfake abuses, primarily due to the
structural diversity of generative models. Current detection methods are prone
to overfitting specific forgery traits, whereas source attribution offers a
robust alternative through fine-grained feature discrimination. However,
synthetic image attribution remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale,
well-categorized synthetic datasets, limiting its practicality and
compatibility with detection systems. In this work, we propose a new paradigm
for image attribution called open-set, few-shot source identification. This
paradigm is designed to reliably identify unseen generators using only limited
samples, making it highly suitable for real-world application. To this end, we
introduce OmniDFA (Omni Detector and Few-shot Attributor), a novel framework
for AIGI that not only assesses the authenticity of images, but also determines
the synthesis origins in a few-shot manner. To facilitate this work, we
construct OmniFake, a large class-aware synthetic image dataset that curates
$1.17$ M images from $45$ distinct generative models, substantially enriching
the foundational resources for research on both AIGI detection and attribution.
Experiments demonstrate that OmniDFA exhibits excellent capability in open-set
attribution and achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance on AIGI
detection. Our dataset and code will be made available.

*Xiping Li,Jianghong Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出AIMCoT框架，通过主动信息驱动的多模态思维链方法，解决现有方法依赖不可靠注意力图和被动选择策略的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态思维链方法依赖简单的启发式方法构建交错思维链，通常基于注意力图，但经验分析显示这些方法不可靠。其被动、无目的的选择策略和任意触发机制在捕捉模型认知需求方面存在不足。

Method: AIMCoT包含三个协同组件：(1)上下文增强的注意力图生成(CAG)，缓解文本-视觉粒度不平衡；(2)主动视觉探测(AVP)，基于信息理论主动选择有助于最大程度回答问题的图像区域；(3)动态注意力转移触发(DAT)，通过监控模型文本到视觉的注意力转移智能确定插入视觉信息的最佳时机。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的基准测试上进行广泛实验，AIMCoT在不同设置下显著优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 通过主动获取信息和动态构建推理过程，AIMCoT代表了向更稳健、有效和类人化多模态推理的关键一步。

Abstract: Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has emerged as a powerful technique for
enhancing the vision-language reasoning with interleaved information. However,
existing methods often rely on simplistic heuristics for constructing
interleaved CoT, typically depending on attention maps, which our empirical
analysis reveals can be unreliable. What's more, the shortcomings of their
passive and purposeless selection strategies and their arbitrary triggering
mechanisms in capturing the model's cognitive need for information are further
amplified. In this paper, we propose \textbf{AIMCoT}, an \textbf{A}ctive
\textbf{I}nformation-driven \textbf{M}ulti-modal
\textbf{C}hain-\textbf{o}f-\textbf{T}hought framework that addresses these
fundamental limitations. AIMCoT introduces three synergistic components: (1)
\textbf{Context-enhanced Attention-map Generation (CAG)}, which mitigates the
text-vision granularity imbalance, thereby producing more reliable attention
maps as a foundation. (2) \textbf{Active Visual Probing (AVP)}, which replaces
passive selection with a proactive, goal-oriented strategy grounded in
information theory to select image regions that help answer the questions
maximally. (3) \textbf{Dynamic Attention-shifting Trigger (DAT)}, which
intelligently determines the optimal moments to insert visual information by
monitoring the model's text-to-vision attention shifts. Extensive experiments
on three challenging benchmarks demonstrate that AIMCoT significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across different settings. By actively
foraging for information and dynamically structuring its reasoning process,
AIMCoT represents a critical step towards more robust, effective, and
human-like multimodal reasoning. Our code is available at

### [30] [How Diffusion Models Memorize](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25705)
*Juyeop Kim,Songkuk Kim,Jong-Seok Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 扩散模型会记忆训练数据，本文通过分析潜在空间动态揭示了记忆机制：早期去噪过程中的训练样本高估是记忆的核心驱动因素，这会减少多样性、使去噪轨迹坍缩并加速向记忆图像的收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然成功生成图像，但会记忆训练数据，引发隐私和版权担忧。尽管已有研究试图描述、检测和缓解记忆现象，但记忆发生的基本原因和机制仍未解决。

Method: 重新审视扩散和去噪过程，分析潜在空间动态，研究记忆如何发生。具体包括：(i) 分析训练损失与记忆的关系；(ii) 研究记忆提示如何将训练图像注入噪声预测；(iii) 分解中间潜在表示以观察初始随机性如何被抑制。

Result: 发现记忆不能仅用过拟合解释，因为记忆时训练损失反而更大；记忆提示会强制潜在轨迹收敛并引导去噪朝向配对样本；中间潜在分解显示初始随机性被快速抑制并被记忆内容替代，偏离理论去噪计划与记忆严重程度高度相关。

Conclusion: 早期高估是扩散模型中记忆现象的核心机制，这为理解和缓解记忆问题提供了新的理论基础。

Abstract: Despite their success in image generation, diffusion models can memorize
training data, raising serious privacy and copyright concerns. Although prior
work has sought to characterize, detect, and mitigate memorization, the
fundamental question of why and how it occurs remains unresolved. In this
paper, we revisit the diffusion and denoising process and analyze latent space
dynamics to address the question: "How do diffusion models memorize?" We show
that memorization is driven by the overestimation of training samples during
early denoising, which reduces diversity, collapses denoising trajectories, and
accelerates convergence toward the memorized image. Specifically: (i)
memorization cannot be explained by overfitting alone, as training loss is
larger under memorization due to classifier-free guidance amplifying
predictions and inducing overestimation; (ii) memorized prompts inject training
images into noise predictions, forcing latent trajectories to converge and
steering denoising toward their paired samples; and (iii) a decomposition of
intermediate latents reveals how initial randomness is quickly suppressed and
replaced by memorized content, with deviations from the theoretical denoising
schedule correlating almost perfectly with memorization severity. Together,
these results identify early overestimation as the central underlying mechanism
of memorization in diffusion models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProbMED是一个多模态医疗视觉语言预训练模型，采用概率对比学习来处理医疗数据中的多对多映射关系，在跨模态检索、零样本和少样本分类任务中表现优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医疗视觉语言预训练模型无法直接处理医疗数据中常见的多对多映射关系，需要一种能够建模嵌入分布而非确定性估计的方法。

Method: 使用概率对比学习，通过InfoNCE损失和Hellinger距离整合跨模态分布，引入概率合成采样损失来捕捉模态特定的均值和方差。

Result: 在13个医疗数据集上的实验表明，该模型在跨模态检索、零样本和少样本分类任务中优于现有Med-VLPMs，并展示了多模态整合的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ProbMED通过概率建模方法有效解决了医疗多模态数据中的多对多映射问题，提升了模态间和模态内的绑定效果。

Abstract: Medical decision-making requires integrating diverse medical information,
from imaging to clinical narratives. These medical modalities are often
acquired in a many-to-many manner. However, current medical vision-language
pretraining models (Med-VLPMs) fail to directly account for this many-to-many
mapping in their model training and embeddings. To address this, we present
Probabilistic Modality-Enhanced Diagnosis (ProbMED), a multimodal Med-VLPM that
employs probabilistic contrastive learning to model distributions over
embeddings rather than deterministic estimates. ProbMED aligns four distinct
modalities -- chest X-rays, electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, and clinical
text -- into a unified probabilistic embedding space. We use InfoNCE loss with
Hellinger distance to integrate inter-modality distributions. We introduce a
probabilistic synthetic sampling loss that captures modality-specific mean and
variance to improve intra-modality binding. Extensive experiments across 13
medical datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms current Med-VLPMs in
cross-modality retrieval, zero-shot, and few-shot classification. We also
demonstrate the robust integration of multiple modalities for prognostication,
showing improved intra- and inter-medical modality binding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MISP-DPO通过引入多负样本和Plackett-Luce模型改进多模态偏好优化，解决了现有方法依赖简单成对比较导致的优化偏差和幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖过度简化的成对比较，仅通过基本扰动或相似性检索生成单个负样本，无法捕捉多模态偏好的复杂性，导致优化偏差和幻觉。

Method: 在CLIP空间中嵌入提示和候选图像，使用稀疏自编码器发现可解释的语义偏差因子，基于重建难度、与正样本的语义偏差和相互多样性选择负样本，采用Plackett-Luce目标和重要性采样策略。

Result: 在五个不同基准测试上的实验表明，MISP-DPO在多项指标上持续优于先前方法，验证了语义感知多负采样在基于偏好的学习中的有效性。

Conclusion: MISP-DPO通过语义感知的多负采样和Plackett-Luce模型，显著提升了多模态对齐性能，为多模态偏好优化提供了更有效的框架。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently been extended from
text-only models to vision-language models. However, existing methods rely on
oversimplified pairwise comparisons, generating a single negative image via
basic perturbations or similarity-based retrieval, which fail to capture the
complex nature of multimodal preferences, inducing optimization bias and
hallucinations. To address this issue, we propose MISP-DPO, the first framework
to incorporate multiple, semantically diverse negative images in multimodal DPO
via the Plackett-Luce model. Our method embeds prompts and candidate images in
CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) space and applies a sparse
autoencoder to uncover semantic deviations into interpretable factors. Negative
samples are selected based on reconstruction difficulty, semantic deviation
from the positive, and mutual diversity, yielding broader and more informative
supervision. To handle multi-negative comparisons, we adopt a Plackett-Luce
objective and introduce an importance sampling strategy that improves training
efficiency. Experiments across five diverse benchmarks demonstrate that
MISP-DPO consistently improves multimodal alignment over prior methods,
validating the effectiveness of semantic-aware, multi-negative sampling in
preference-based learning.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注描述符微调或固定采样策略，忽略了训练过程中空间上下文和视觉相似性之间的动态交互作用。

Method: 提出SAGE训练管道，包含轻量级Soft Probing模块学习补丁描述符的残差权重，构建在线地理-视觉图融合地理邻近性和视觉相似性，并使用加权团扩展采样器聚焦信息丰富的区域。

Result: 在8个基准测试中达到SOTA，在SPED、Pitts30k-test、MSLS-val和Nordland上分别获得98.9%、95.8%、94.5%和96.0%的Recall@1，在SPED上仅使用4096D全局描述符就获得100%的Recall@10。

Conclusion: SAGE通过动态空间-视觉交互和高效训练策略，显著提升了视觉地点识别的性能，证明了其在处理外观、视角和环境变化方面的有效性。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) requires robust retrieval of geotagged images
despite large appearance, viewpoint, and environmental variation. Prior methods
focus on descriptor fine-tuning or fixed sampling strategies yet neglect the
dynamic interplay between spatial context and visual similarity during
training. We present SAGE (Spatial-visual Adaptive Graph Exploration), a
unified training pipeline that enhances granular spatial-visual discrimination
by jointly improving local feature aggregation, organize samples during
training, and hard sample mining. We introduce a lightweight Soft Probing
module that learns residual weights from training data for patch descriptors
before bilinear aggregation, boosting distinctive local cues. During training
we reconstruct an online geo-visual graph that fuses geographic proximity and
current visual similarity so that candidate neighborhoods reflect the evolving
embedding landscape. To concentrate learning on the most informative place
neighborhoods, we seed clusters from high-affinity anchors and iteratively
expand them with a greedy weighted clique expansion sampler. Implemented with a
frozen DINOv2 backbone and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, SAGE achieves SOTA
across eight benchmarks. It attains 98.9%, 95.8%, 94.5%, and 96.0% Recall@1 on
SPED, Pitts30k-test, MSLS-val, and Nordland, respectively. Notably, our method
obtains 100% Recall@10 on SPED only using 4096D global descriptors. Code and
model will be available at: https://github.com/chenshunpeng/SAGE.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LaTo是一个基于地标标记化的扩散变换器，用于细粒度、身份保持的人脸编辑，通过离散化地标坐标、统一位置编码和基于视觉语言模型的地标预测，解决了现有方法在精确属性控制和身份保持方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态人脸编辑方法在语义操作方面表现良好，但在精确属性控制和身份保持方面仍存在困难。传统方法将结构性地标作为刚性几何约束，当地标条件与源图像显著偏离时（如大表情或姿态变化、不准确的地标估计），会降低身份保持效果。

Method: 提出LaTo框架，包含三个关键创新：(1) 地标标记器，将原始地标坐标直接量化为离散面部标记；(2) 位置映射位置编码，集成面部和图像标记进行统一处理；(3) 地标预测器，利用视觉语言模型从指令和源图像推断目标地标。还构建了HFL-150K数据集来解决数据稀缺问题。

Result: 在广泛实验中，LaTo在身份保持方面比最先进方法提高了7.8%，在语义一致性方面提高了4.6%。

Conclusion: LaTo通过创新的地标标记化和统一处理框架，实现了细粒度、身份保持的人脸编辑，显著提升了编辑质量和控制精度。

Abstract: Recent multimodal models for instruction-based face editing enable semantic
manipulation but still struggle with precise attribute control and identity
preservation. Structural facial representations such as landmarks are effective
for intermediate supervision, yet most existing methods treat them as rigid
geometric constraints, which can degrade identity when conditional landmarks
deviate significantly from the source (e.g., large expression or pose changes,
inaccurate landmark estimates). To address these limitations, we propose LaTo,
a landmark-tokenized diffusion transformer for fine-grained,
identity-preserving face editing. Our key innovations include: (1) a landmark
tokenizer that directly quantizes raw landmark coordinates into discrete facial
tokens, obviating the need for dense pixel-wise correspondence; (2) a
location-mapping positional encoding that integrates facial and image tokens
for unified processing, enabling flexible yet decoupled geometry-appearance
interactions with high efficiency and strong identity preservation; and (3) a
landmark predictor that leverages vision-language models to infer target
landmarks from instructions and source images, whose structured
chain-of-thought improves estimation accuracy and interactive control. To
mitigate data scarcity, we curate HFL-150K, to our knowledge the largest
benchmark for this task, containing over 150K real face pairs with fine-grained
instructions. Extensive experiments show that LaTo outperforms state-of-the-art
methods by 7.8% in identity preservation and 4.6% in semantic consistency. Code
and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Result: 在MOSEv1挑战赛测试集上获得86.37%的J&F分数，排名第一。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效应对复杂场景下的视频对象分割挑战。

Abstract: Video Object Segmentation (VOS) aims to track and segment specific objects
across entire video sequences, yet it remains highly challenging under complex
real-world scenarios. The MOSEv1 and LVOS dataset, adopted in the MOSEv1
challenge on LSVOS 2025, which is specifically designed to enhance the
robustness of VOS models in complex real-world scenarios, including long-term
object disappearances and reappearances, as well as the presence of small and
inconspicuous objects. In this paper, we present our improved method,
Confidence-Guided Fusion Segmentation (CGFSeg), for the VOS task in the MOSEv1
Challenge. During training, the feature extractor of SAM2 is frozen, while the
remaining components are fine-tuned to preserve strong feature extraction
ability and improve segmentation accuracy. In the inference stage, we introduce
a pixel-check strategy that progressively refines predictions by exploiting
complementary strengths of multiple models, thereby yielding robust final
masks. As a result, our method achieves a J&F score of 86.37% on the test set,
ranking 1st in the MOSEv1 Challenge at LSVOS 2025. These results highlight the
effectiveness of our approach in addressing the challenges of VOS task in
complex scenarios.

Motivation: 从单张RGB图像恢复3D人体网格存在固有的模糊性，现有方法要么回归单一确定性输出，要么在准确性和样本多样性之间存在权衡。需要一种能够建模良好对齐分布的方法。

Method: 使用SO(3)扩散模型生成3D旋转表示的姿态参数分布，通过条件dropout实现无条件和图像条件生成。使用transformer学习人体关节的层次结构，MLP去噪模型学习基于潜在向量的逐关节分布。

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效预测准确的姿态概率分布，解决了准确性和多样性之间的权衡问题。

Conclusion: 提出的SO(3)扩散模型方法能够有效建模人体姿态的概率分布，在保持准确性的同时提供多样性，优于现有的概率性方法。

Abstract: We tackle the problem of Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) from a single RGB image,
formulating it as an image-conditioned human pose and shape generation. While
recovering 3D human pose from 2D observations is inherently ambiguous, most
existing approaches have regressed a single deterministic output. Probabilistic
methods attempt to address this by generating multiple plausible outputs to
model the ambiguity. However, these methods often exhibit a trade-off between
accuracy and sample diversity, and their single predictions are not competitive
with state-of-the-art deterministic models. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a novel approach that models well-aligned distribution to 2D
observations. In particular, we introduce $SO(3)$ diffusion model, which
generates the distribution of pose parameters represented as 3D rotations
unconditional and conditional to image observations via conditioning dropout.
Our model learns the hierarchical structure of human body joints using the
transformer. Instead of using transformer as a denoising model, the
time-independent transformer extracts latent vectors for the joints and a small
MLP-based denoising model learns the per-joint distribution conditioned on the
latent vector. We experimentally demonstrate and analyze that our model
predicts accurate pose probability distribution effectively.

Motivation: 传统基于拖拽的图像编辑方法主要在2D像素平面上操作，缺乏3D几何线索，导致在旋转和透视变换等几何密集型场景中产生不精确和不一致的编辑结果。

Method: 提出统一的位移场，联合编码3D几何和2D空间先验，并引入无冲突分区策略来隔离编辑区域，防止干扰并确保一致性。

Conclusion: GeoDrag能够实现连贯、高保真和结构一致的图像编辑，在单次前向传播中完成编辑，代码将在GitHub上开源。

Abstract: Interactive point-based image editing serves as a controllable editor,
enabling precise and flexible manipulation of image content. However, most
drag-based methods operate primarily on the 2D pixel plane with limited use of
3D cues. As a result, they often produce imprecise and inconsistent edits,
particularly in geometry-intensive scenarios such as rotations and perspective
transformations. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
geometry-guided drag-based image editing method - GeoDrag, which addresses
three key challenges: 1) incorporating 3D geometric cues into pixel-level
editing, 2) mitigating discontinuities caused by geometry-only guidance, and 3)
resolving conflicts arising from multi-point dragging. Built upon a unified
displacement field that jointly encodes 3D geometry and 2D spatial priors,
GeoDrag enables coherent, high-fidelity, and structure-consistent editing in a
single forward pass. In addition, a conflict-free partitioning strategy is
introduced to isolate editing regions, effectively preventing interference and
ensuring consistency. Extensive experiments across various editing scenarios
validate the effectiveness of our method, showing superior precision,
structural consistency, and reliable multi-point editability. The code will be

Conclusion: 利用单视角内空间信息为实际应用中视角受限场景提供了鲁棒解决方案，显著增强了视角不变重建能力。

Abstract: Volume-based indoor scene reconstruction methods demonstrate significant
research value due to their superior generalization capability and real-time
deployment potential. However, existing methods rely on multi-view pixel
back-projection ray intersections as weak geometric constraints to determine
spatial positions, causing reconstruction quality to depend heavily on input
view density with poor performance in overlapping regions and unobserved areas.
To address these issues, the key lies in reducing dependency on inter-view
geometric constraints while exploiting rich spatial information within
individual views. We propose IPDRecon, an image-plane decoding framework
comprising three core components: Pixel-level Confidence Encoder (PCE), Affine
Compensation Module (ACM), and Image-Plane Spatial Decoder (IPSD). These
modules collaboratively decode 3D structural information encoded in 2D images
through physical imaging processes, effectively preserving spatial geometric
features including edges, hollow structures, and complex textures while
significantly enhancing view-invariant reconstruction. Experiments on ScanNetV2
confirm that IPDRecon achieves superior reconstruction stability, maintaining
nearly identical quality when view count reduces by 40%. The method achieves a
coefficient of variation of only 0.24%, performance retention rate of 99.7%,
and maximum performance drop of merely 0.42%. This demonstrates that exploiting
intra-view spatial information provides a robust solution for view-limited
scenarios in practical applications.

TL;DR: 评估多模态大语言模型在金融短视频主题对齐字幕生成中的表现，测试了7种模态组合在5个主题上的效果，发现视频模态在多数主题上表现强劲，而过多模态组合可能引入噪音。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建立金融短视频字幕生成的基准，探索多模态模型在复杂视觉线索理解中的潜力和挑战。

Method: 使用624个标注的YouTube短视频，测试7种模态组合（T、A、V、TA、TV、AV、TAV）在5个主题上的表现：主要推荐、情感分析、视频目的、视觉分析和金融实体识别。

Result: 视频单独模态在5个主题中的4个表现强劲；选择性模态组合如TV或AV通常优于全模态TAV；过多模态可能引入噪音。

Conclusion: 建立了金融短视频字幕生成的第一个基准，展示了在该领域基于复杂视觉线索的潜力和挑战。

Abstract: We evaluate multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for topic-aligned
captioning in financial short-form videos (SVs) by testing joint reasoning over
transcripts (T), audio (A), and video (V). Using 624 annotated YouTube SVs, we
assess all seven modality combinations (T, A, V, TA, TV, AV, TAV) across five
topics: main recommendation, sentiment analysis, video purpose, visual
analysis, and financial entity recognition. Video alone performs strongly on
four of five topics, underscoring its value for capturing visual context and
effective cues such as emotions, gestures, and body language. Selective pairs
such as TV or AV often surpass TAV, implying that too many modalities may
introduce noise. These results establish the first baselines for financial
short-form video captioning and illustrate the potential and challenges of
grounding complex visual cues in this domain. All code and data can be found on

Abstract: Ultrasound is crucial in modern medicine but faces challenges like operator
dependence, image noise, and real-time scanning, hindering AI integration.
While large multimodal models excel in other medical imaging areas, they
struggle with ultrasound's complexities. To address this, we introduce Dolphin
v1.0 (V1) and its reasoning-augmented version, Dolphin R1-the first large-scale
multimodal ultrasound foundation models unifying diverse clinical tasks in a
single vision-language framework.To tackle ultrasound variability and noise, we
curated a 2-million-scale multimodal dataset, combining textbook knowledge,
public data, synthetic samples, and general corpora. This ensures robust
perception, generalization, and clinical adaptability.The Dolphin series
employs a three-stage training strategy: domain-specialized pretraining,
instruction-driven alignment, and reinforcement-based refinement. Dolphin v1.0
delivers reliable performance in classification, detection, regression, and
report generation. Dolphin R1 enhances diagnostic inference, reasoning
transparency, and interpretability through reinforcement learning with
ultrasound-specific rewards.Evaluated on U2-Bench across eight ultrasound
tasks, Dolphin R1 achieves a U2-score of 0.5835-over twice the second-best
model (0.2968) setting a new state of the art. Dolphin v1.0 also performs
competitively, validating the unified framework. Comparisons show
reasoning-enhanced training significantly improves diagnostic accuracy,
consistency, and interpretability, highlighting its importance for high-stakes
medical AI.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ART-VITON是一个基于测量引导扩散的虚拟试穿框架，通过线性逆问题重构和轨迹对齐求解器，有效保留非试穿区域的身份和背景信息，消除边界伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟试穿方法在保留非试穿区域（如身份和背景）方面存在挑战，直接替换策略会导致边界伪影，而现有求解器在生成过程中会出现语义漂移问题。

Method: 将虚拟试穿重构为线性逆问题，采用轨迹对齐求解器渐进实施测量一致性；集成基于残差先验的初始化缓解训练-推理不匹配；使用无伪影测量引导采样，结合数据一致性、频率级校正和周期性标准去噪。

Result: 在VITON-HD、DressCode和SHHQ-1.0数据集上的实验表明，ART-VITON能有效保留身份和背景，消除边界伪影，在视觉保真度和鲁棒性方面持续优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: ART-VITON通过测量引导的扩散框架成功解决了虚拟试穿中的边界伪影和语义漂移问题，为高质量虚拟试穿提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Virtual try-on (VITON) aims to generate realistic images of a person wearing
a target garment, requiring precise garment alignment in try-on regions and
faithful preservation of identity and background in non-try-on regions. While
latent diffusion models (LDMs) have advanced alignment and detail synthesis,
preserving non-try-on regions remains challenging. A common post-hoc strategy
directly replaces these regions with original content, but abrupt transitions
often produce boundary artifacts. To overcome this, we reformulate VITON as a
linear inverse problem and adopt trajectory-aligned solvers that progressively
enforce measurement consistency, reducing abrupt changes in non-try-on regions.
However, existing solvers still suffer from semantic drift during generation,
leading to artifacts. We propose ART-VITON, a measurement-guided diffusion
framework that ensures measurement adherence while maintaining artifact-free
synthesis. Our method integrates residual prior-based initialization to
mitigate training-inference mismatch and artifact-free measurement-guided
sampling that combines data consistency, frequency-level correction, and
periodic standard denoising. Experiments on VITON-HD, DressCode, and SHHQ-1.0
demonstrate that ART-VITON effectively preserves identity and background,
eliminates boundary artifacts, and consistently improves visual fidelity and
robustness over state-of-the-art baselines.

Motivation: 解决扩散式文本到图像生成模型中文本与生成图像准确对齐的挑战，避免依赖昂贵的人工标注和配对图像偏好数据。

Method: 开发TPO框架，通过训练模型偏好匹配提示而非不匹配提示（使用大语言模型扰动原始标题构建），扩展DPO和KTO算法为TDPO和TKTO。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法在人类偏好评分和文本到图像对齐方面持续优于原始方法。

Conclusion: TPO框架提供了一种无需配对图像偏好数据的"免费午餐"对齐方法，具有更好的可扩展性和性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models have led to
remarkable success in generating high-quality images from textual prompts.
However, ensuring accurate alignment between the text and the generated image
remains a significant challenge for state-of-the-art diffusion models. To
address this, existing studies employ reinforcement learning with human
feedback (RLHF) to align T2I outputs with human preferences. These methods,
however, either rely directly on paired image preference data or require a
learned reward function, both of which depend heavily on costly, high-quality
human annotations and thus face scalability limitations. In this work, we
introduce Text Preference Optimization (TPO), a framework that enables
"free-lunch" alignment of T2I models, achieving alignment without the need for
paired image preference data. TPO works by training the model to prefer matched
prompts over mismatched prompts, which are constructed by perturbing original
captions using a large language model. Our framework is general and compatible
with existing preference-based algorithms. We extend both DPO and KTO to our
setting, resulting in TDPO and TKTO. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
across multiple benchmarks show that our methods consistently outperform their
original counterparts, delivering better human preference scores and improved
text-to-image alignment. Our Open-source code is available at

Motivation: 评估和诊断多模态大语言模型理解幽默的能力，这对于增强人机交互的参与度具有实际应用价值。

Method: 构建v-HUB基准，包含精选的少语言短视频，配以丰富的注释（字幕、描述、解释），支持字幕匹配和幽默解释等评估任务，并构建开放式视频问答任务。评估了从专业视频LLM到通用OmniLLM的多种模型。

Result: 实验结果显示MLLMs仅通过视觉线索理解幽默存在困难，所有模型在从基于文本评估转向基于视频评估（无音频）时性能显著下降。加入音频有助于视频幽默理解，表明声音信息的重要性。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型在仅通过视觉线索理解幽默方面面临挑战，整合更丰富的模态（如音频）对于复杂视频理解任务具有前景。

Abstract: AI models capable of comprehending humor hold real-world promise -- for
example, enhancing engagement in human-machine interactions. To gauge and
diagnose the capacity of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for humor
understanding, we introduce v-HUB, a novel visual-centric video humor
understanding benchmark. v-HUB comprises a curated collection of minimally
verbal short videos, sourced from classic silent films and online resources,
and reflecting real-world scenarios where humor can be appreciated purely
through visual cues. Each video clip is paired with rich annotations, including
captions, descriptions, and explanations, supporting evaluation tasks like
caption matching and humor explanation. To broaden its applicability, we
further construct an open-ended video QA task, making it readily integrable
into existing video understanding benchmarks. We evaluate a diverse set of
MLLMs, from specialized Video-LLMs to versatile OmniLLMs that can process
audio, covering both open-source and proprietary domains. The experimental
results expose the difficulties MLLMs face in comprehending humor from visual
cues alone. For example, all models exhibit a marked performance drop on
caption matching when moving from text-based to video-based evaluation (without
audio). Our findings also demonstrate that incorporating audio helps with video
humor understanding, highlighting the informativeness of sound and the promise
of integrating richer modalities for complex video understanding tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PCPO是一个用于稳定文本到图像模型强化学习训练的新框架，通过比例信用分配解决了策略梯度方法中的训练不稳定和高方差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的策略梯度方法在文本到图像模型对齐中存在训练不稳定和高方差问题，阻碍收敛速度并损害图像质量。分析发现主要原因是生成采样器的数学结构导致跨时间步的信用分配不成比例。

Method: 提出比例信用策略优化(PCPO)框架，通过稳定的目标重构和原则性的时间步重加权来强制实施比例信用分配。

Result: PCPO显著稳定了训练过程，加速了收敛速度，提升了图像质量，并缓解了模型崩溃这一递归训练中的常见故障模式。

Conclusion: PCPO在所有方面都显著优于现有的策略梯度基线方法，包括最先进的DanceGRPO。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning has advanced the alignment of text-to-image
(T2I) models, state-of-the-art policy gradient methods are still hampered by
training instability and high variance, hindering convergence speed and
compromising image quality. Our analysis identifies a key cause of this
instability: disproportionate credit assignment, in which the mathematical
structure of the generative sampler produces volatile and non-proportional
feedback across timesteps. To address this, we introduce Proportionate Credit
Policy Optimization (PCPO), a framework that enforces proportional credit
assignment through a stable objective reformulation and a principled
reweighting of timesteps. This correction stabilizes the training process,
leading to significantly accelerated convergence and superior image quality.
The improvement in quality is a direct result of mitigating model collapse, a
common failure mode in recursive training. PCPO substantially outperforms
existing policy gradient baselines on all fronts, including the
state-of-the-art DanceGRPO.

### [45] [Editable Noise Map Inversion: Encoding Target-image into Noise For High-Fidelity Image Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25776)
*Mingyu Kang,Yong Suk Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ENM Inversion方法，通过搜索最优噪声图来平衡内容保持和编辑能力，解决现有文本引导图像编辑方法在遵循目标文本提示方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在图像编辑中面临挑战：虽然能够将源图像反转为可编辑噪声图，但这些噪声图在忠实重建源图像的同时限制了编辑灵活性，难以紧密遵循目标文本提示。

Method: 提出可编辑噪声图反演(ENM Inversion)，通过分析噪声图特性来增强可编辑性，引入可编辑噪声精炼，通过最小化重建和编辑噪声图之间的差异来对齐期望的编辑效果。

Result: 大量实验表明，ENM Inversion在广泛的图像编辑任务中，在内容保持和编辑保真度方面均优于现有方法，并能轻松应用于视频编辑，实现跨帧的时间一致性和内容操作。

Conclusion: ENM Inversion是一种有效的噪声图反演技术，能够同时确保内容保持和编辑能力，显著提升文本引导图像编辑的性能，并具有良好的扩展性。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating
high-quality and diverse images. Building on these advancements, diffusion
models have also demonstrated exceptional performance in text-guided image
editing. A key strategy for effective image editing involves inverting the
source image into editable noise maps associated with the target image.
However, previous inversion methods face challenges in adhering closely to the
target text prompt. The limitation arises because inverted noise maps, while
enabling faithful reconstruction of the source image, restrict the flexibility
needed for desired edits. To overcome this issue, we propose Editable Noise Map
Inversion (ENM Inversion), a novel inversion technique that searches for
optimal noise maps to ensure both content preservation and editability. We
analyze the properties of noise maps for enhanced editability. Based on this
analysis, our method introduces an editable noise refinement that aligns with
the desired edits by minimizing the difference between the reconstructed and
edited noise maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ENM Inversion
outperforms existing approaches across a wide range of image editing tasks in
both preservation and edit fidelity with target prompts. Our approach can also
be easily applied to video editing, enabling temporal consistency and content
manipulation across frames.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型后训练方法依赖昂贵的人工标注数据，而自监督方法在感知领域如图像质量评估中的应用仍未被充分探索。

Method: 将自我一致性原则应用于基于排名的图像质量评估，通过成对多数投票生成伪标签，构建保真度奖励，使用组相对策略优化进行迭代进化。

Result: EvoQuality将基础模型的零样本性能在PLCC指标上提升了31.8%，在7个图像质量评估基准中的5个上超越了最先进的监督模型。

Conclusion: EvoQuality证明了完全自监督的方法可以在图像质量评估任务中达到甚至超越监督方法的性能，为视觉语言模型的感知能力提升提供了新途径。

Abstract: Improving vision-language models (VLMs) in the post-training stage typically
relies on supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, methods that
necessitate costly, human-annotated data. While self-supervised techniques such
as self-consistency have proven effective for enhancing reasoning capabilities,
their application to perceptual domains such as image quality assessment (IQA)
remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce EvoQuality, a novel
framework that enables a VLM to autonomously refine its quality perception
capabilities without any ground-truth labels. EvoQuality adapts the principle
of self-consistency to the ranking-based nature of IQA. It generates
pseudo-labels by performing pairwise majority voting on the VLM's own outputs
to establish a consensus on relative quality. These pseudo-rankings are then
formulated into a fidelity reward that guides the model's iterative evolution
through group relative policy optimization (GRPO). By iteratively leveraging
its own predictions, EvoQuality progressively refines the VLM's perceptual
capability. Extensive experiments show that EvoQuality boosts the base VLM's
zero-shot performance by 31.8\% on PLCC across diverse IQA benchmarks.
Remarkably, despite being entirely self-supervised, EvoQuality achieves
performance that is competitive with, or even surpasses, state-of-the-art
supervised VLM-based IQA models, outperforming these models on 5 out of 7 IQA
benchmarks.

TL;DR: EchoingECG是一个概率性师生模型，利用不确定性感知的ECG嵌入和ECHO监督来改进基于ECG的心脏功能预测，在零样本、少样本和微调设置下优于现有ECG基础模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心电图(ECG)成本低且易获取，而超声心动图(ECHO)需要大量医院资源但临床价值高。研究旨在利用ECG预测传统上需要ECHO才能获得的心脏功能指标，使ECG成为更易获取的预测工具。

Method: 结合概率跨模态嵌入(PCME++)和ECHO-CLIP(基于ECHO-文本对预训练的视觉语言模型)，通过师生模型将ECHO知识蒸馏到ECG表示中，实现不确定性感知的ECG嵌入。

Result: EchoingECG在基于ECG的ECHO预测任务中，在零样本、少样本和微调设置下均优于最先进的ECG基础模型。方差估计帮助识别ECG中的不确定性区域，增强了对模型性能的理解。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将ECHO知识蒸馏到ECG表示中，提高了ECG在心脏功能预测中的性能，同时通过不确定性估计提供了对模型性能的深入理解。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely used tool for assessing cardiac function
due to its low cost and accessibility. Emergent research shows that ECGs can
help make predictions on key outcomes traditionally derived from more complex
modalities such as echocardiograms (ECHO), enabling the use of ECGs as a more
accessible method to predict broader measurements of cardiac function. ECHO, in
particular, are of great importance because they require considerable hospital
resources while playing a key role in clinical cardiac assessment. To aid this
use case, we introduce EchoingECG, a probabilistic student-teacher model that
leverages uncertainty-aware ECG embeddings and ECHO supervision to improve
ECG-based cardiac function prediction. Our approach integrates Probabilistic
Cross-Modal Embeddings (PCME++), a probabilistic contrastive framework, with
ECHO-CLIP, a vision-language pre-trained model trained on ECHO-text pairs, to
distill ECHO knowledge into ECG representations. Through experiments and
external validation, we showed that EchoingECG outperforms state-of-the-art
foundation ECG models in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tune settings for ECHO
predictions based on ECG. We also highlighted that variance estimation (enabled
through our method) enhanced our understanding of model performance by
identifying underlying regions of uncertainty within ECGs. The code is

Motivation: 现有基准主要通过基于图像标注的多选题评估VLM的具身推理能力，缺乏对精确视觉定位能力的系统评估。

Method: 设计了包含三个阶段的层次评估协议：S1（目标定位）、S2（任务驱动指向）、S3（视觉轨迹预测），数据来自室内、厨房、驾驶和机器人操作等关键领域。

Result: 对10多个最先进VLM的实验发现：GPT-4o等通用模型在精确视觉定位上表现不如某些开源模型；MoLMO在S1和S2表现良好但在S3（需要视觉轨迹规划）上表现不佳。

Conclusion: PIO基准揭示了VLM在具身推理中精确视觉定位能力的局限性，为未来模型开发提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive world knowledge
across a wide range of tasks, making them promising candidates for embodied
reasoning applications. However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate the
embodied reasoning ability of VLMs through multiple-choice questions based on
image annotations -- for example, selecting which trajectory better describes
an event in the image. In this work, we introduce the Point-It-Out (PIO)
benchmark, a novel benchmark designed to systematically assess the embodied
reasoning abilities of VLMs through precise visual grounding. We propose a
hierarchical evaluation protocol spanning three stages (S1: referred-object
localization, S2: task-driven pointing, and S3: visual trace prediction), with
data collected from critical domains for embodied intelligence, including
indoor, kitchen, driving, and robotic manipulation scenarios. Extensive
experiments with over ten state-of-the-art VLMs reveal several interesting
findings. For example, strong general-purpose models such as GPT-4o, while
excelling on many benchmarks (e.g., language, perception, and reasoning),
underperform compared to some open-source models in precise visual grounding;
models such as MoLMO perform well in S1 and S2 but struggle in S3, where
requires grounding combined with visual trace planning.

Motivation: 农业计算机视觉任务中，基础模型参数高效微调面临训练数据有限和复杂田间条件的挑战。

Method: 使用动态相似性图构建和自适应局部特征聚合的DSGA模块，结合LoRA创建互补优化框架，仅需4.00M可训练参数。

Result: 在鹰嘴豆荚数据集上，相比基线SAM微调，结构度量提升17.31%，自适应F度量提升62.36%，在2-10样本设置下均表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂田间条件下实现了准确的豆荚计数（调整R平方0.8987），为自动化农业监测提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of foundation models for agricultural
computer vision tasks remains challenging due to limited training data and
complex field conditions. This study introduces a Dynamic Similarity-based
Graph Adaptation (DSGA) module to adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) under
extreme data constraints for precise foreground and instance segmentation of
small dense objects in complex agricultural environments. Through dynamic
similarity graph construction with a learnable polynomial decay-initialized
weight ranking mechanism and adaptive local feature aggregation, DSGA
establishes robust spatial and dynamic similarity representation with only
4.00M trainable parameters, which is 4.26% of the original SAM. Integrating
this graph-based feature adaptation with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) creates a
complementary optimization framework that effectively captures both local and
global dependencies in image embeddings while preserving model stability and
parameter efficiency. Experimental results on a challenging chickpea pod
dataset demonstrated that DSGA with LoRA achieved superior performance across
multiple metrics evaluated under 2, 4, 8 and 10 shots, with progressive
performance gains as shot count increased. Quantitative metrics showed a 17.31%
improvement in Structure-measure and a 62.36% gain in adaptive F-measure
compared to the baseline SAM fine-tuning. Comprehensive ablation studies and
visualization analyses through Grad-CAM and t-SNE validated the framework's
effectiveness in feature discrimination. The proposed adaptation demonstrated
practical utility for automated agricultural monitoring applications, achieving
accurate pod-counting with an adjusted R-squared of 0.8987 for images with 10
to 120 pods under challenging field conditions.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在领域特定场景（如产品审核）中的应用研究不足，传统logo识别方法依赖记忆大量品牌表示，在现实场景中不实用。

Method: 将logo识别重新定义为基于比较的任务，匹配产品图像与候选logo而非直接生成品牌标签；引入Logo Perception Grounding注入领域知识，Logo-Guided Visual Grounded Reasoning增强推理能力。

Conclusion: 提出的Logo-VGR方法通过新的领域特定多模态推理范式，有效解决了logo识别的泛化问题，为产品审核等应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been
primarily evaluated on general-purpose benchmarks, while their applications in
domain-specific scenarios, such as intelligent product moderation, remain
underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce an open-world logo recognition
benchmark, a core challenge in product moderation. Unlike traditional logo
recognition methods that rely on memorizing representations of tens of
thousands of brands-an impractical approach in real-world settings-our proposed
method, Logo-VGR, enables generalization to large-scale brand recognition with
supervision from only a small subset of brands. Specifically, we reformulate
logo recognition as a comparison-based task, requiring the model to match
product images with candidate logos rather than directly generating brand
labels. We further observe that existing models tend to overfit by memorizing
brand distributions instead of learning robust multimodal reasoning, which
results in poor performance on unseen brands. To overcome this limitation,
Logo-VGR introduces a new paradigm of domain-specific multimodal reasoning:
Logo Perception Grounding injects domain knowledge, and Logo-Guided Visual
Grounded Reasoning enhances the model's reasoning capability. Experimental
results show that Logo-VGR outperforms strong baselines by nearly 10 points in
OOD settings, demonstrating superior generalization.

Abstract: Understanding the spatio-temporal distribution of species is a cornerstone of
ecology and conservation. By pairing species observations with geographic and
environmental predictors, researchers can model the relationship between an
environment and the species which may be found there. To advance the
state-of-the-art in this area with deep learning models and remote sensing
data, we organized an open machine learning challenge called GeoLifeCLEF 2023.
The training dataset comprised 5 million plant species observations (single
positive label per sample) distributed across Europe and covering most of its
flora, high-resolution rasters: remote sensing imagery, land cover, elevation,
in addition to coarse-resolution data: climate, soil and human footprint
variables. In this multi-label classification task, we evaluated models ability
to predict the species composition in 22 thousand small plots based on
standardized surveys. This paper presents an overview of the competition,
synthesizes the approaches used by the participating teams, and analyzes the
main results. In particular, we highlight the biases faced by the methods
fitted to single positive labels when it comes to the multi-label evaluation,
and the new and effective learning strategy combining single and multi-label
data in training.

### [52] [VELA: An LLM-Hybrid-as-a-Judge Approach for Evaluating Long Image Captions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25818)
*Kazuki Matsuda,Yuiga Wada,Shinnosuke Hirano,Seitaro Otsuki,Komei Sugiura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了VELA，一种用于评估多模态大语言模型生成的长图像描述的自动评估指标，以及专门用于长描述评估的基准LongCap-Arena。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像描述评估指标主要针对短描述设计，不适用于长描述评估，且现有LLM-as-a-Judge方法存在推理速度慢的问题。

Method: 提出VELA评估指标，采用新颖的LLM-Hybrid-as-a-Judge框架，并构建LongCap-Arena基准，包含7,805张图像、人类提供的长参考描述和候选描述，以及32,246个人类判断。

Result: VELA在LongCap-Arena基准上超越了现有指标，并实现了超人类性能。

Conclusion: VELA是评估长图像描述的有效自动评估指标，在LongCap-Arena基准上表现优异。

Abstract: In this study, we focus on the automatic evaluation of long and detailed
image captions generated by multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Most
existing automatic evaluation metrics for image captioning are primarily
designed for short captions and are not suitable for evaluating long captions.
Moreover, recent LLM-as-a-Judge approaches suffer from slow inference due to
their reliance on autoregressive inference and early fusion of visual
information. To address these limitations, we propose VELA, an automatic
evaluation metric for long captions developed within a novel
LLM-Hybrid-as-a-Judge framework. Furthermore, we propose LongCap-Arena, a
benchmark specifically designed for evaluating metrics for long captions. This
benchmark comprises 7,805 images, the corresponding human-provided long
reference captions and long candidate captions, and 32,246 human judgments from
three distinct perspectives: Descriptiveness, Relevance, and Fluency. We
demonstrated that VELA outperformed existing metrics and achieved superhuman
performance on LongCap-Arena.

*Jinho Chang,Jaemin Kim,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练、基于奖励引导的图像编辑框架，将编辑过程建模为轨迹最优控制问题，在保持源图像语义内容的同时增强目标奖励。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于奖励引导的方法主要关注图像生成，但在图像编辑任务中如何保持源图像内容同时增强特定奖励的研究较少。

Method: 将扩散模型的反向过程视为从源图像出发的可控轨迹，通过迭代更新伴随状态来引导编辑过程，无需额外训练。

Result: 在多种编辑任务上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有的基于反转的无训练引导基线，在奖励最大化和源图像保真度之间达到更好平衡。

Conclusion: 该框架为奖励引导的图像编辑提供了一种有效的训练免费解决方案，避免了奖励破解问题，实现了内容保持与奖励增强的良好平衡。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion and flow-matching models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in high-fidelity image synthesis. A prominent line of
research involves reward-guided guidance, which steers the generation process
during inference to align with specific objectives. However, leveraging this
reward-guided approach to the task of image editing, which requires preserving
the semantic content of the source image while enhancing a target reward, is
largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for
training-free, reward-guided image editing. We formulate the editing process as
a trajectory optimal control problem where the reverse process of a diffusion
model is treated as a controllable trajectory originating from the source
image, and the adjoint states are iteratively updated to steer the editing
process. Through extensive experiments across distinct editing tasks, we
demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing
inversion-based training-free guidance baselines, achieving a superior balance
between reward maximization and fidelity to the source image without reward
hacking.

TL;DR: 本文提出VAPO方法解决多模态推理中的视觉遗忘问题，通过视觉锚定策略优化增强模型对视觉信息的依赖，在多个基准测试中达到新SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态推理虽然能增强逻辑推理能力，但会逐渐损害感知基础，导致基本视觉问题识别失败。这种现象源于视觉遗忘，即长时间推理使模型越来越忽视视觉输入。

Method: 提出Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO)，一种简单有效的方法，明确引导推理过程朝向视觉锚定的轨迹。

Result: VAPO-Thinker-7B模型显著增强了模型对视觉信息的依赖，在广泛建立的基准测试中取得了新的最先进结果。

Conclusion: VAPO方法有效解决了多模态推理中的视觉遗忘问题，平衡了推理能力与视觉感知的保持。

Abstract: Reasoning has emerged as a pivotal capability in Large Language Models
(LLMs). Through Reinforcement Learning (RL), typically Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), these models are able to solve complex tasks such as
mathematics and code generation. Building on these advances, recent research
has sought to extend reasoning to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), yielding
promising results across diverse visual tasks. Despite this progress, our study
uncovers the dual nature of multimodal reasoning: while it substantially
enhances logical inference and facilitates performance on challenging problems,
it may gradually impair perceptual grounding, leading to recognition failures
on otherwise basic visual questions. Through further analysis, we attribute
this phenomenon to visual forgetting, wherein prolonged reasoning causes the
model to increasingly disregard visual input. To address this, we propose
Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO), a simple yet effective method that
explicitly steers the reasoning process toward visually grounded trajectories.
Our result model, VAPO-Thinker-7B, significantly strengthens the model's
reliance on visual information and achieves new state-of-the-art results on a
wide range of established benchmarks. Project page:

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个新的视觉惯性SLAM数据集和基准测试，专门针对可穿戴设备的自我中心数据采集挑战，包括更广泛的运动多样性、动态视觉内容和长时间会话等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前SLAM研究缺乏能够反映可穿戴设备特有挑战（如运动多样性、动态内容、长时间运行）的基准测试，且现有基准测试缺乏足够准确的地面真实姿态。

Method: 使用眼镜式设备记录城市中心的多模态数据，利用测量工具获取厘米级精度的控制点作为间接姿态标注，支持极端场景（如夜间行走、车辆行驶）的评估。

Result: 实验表明现有最先进的学术SLAM系统无法应对这些挑战，并识别了导致问题的关键组件。设计了不同难度级别的测试轨迹以便深入分析。

Conclusion: 提出了一个具有城市规模、厘米级精度的视觉惯性SLAM数据集和基准测试，填补了可穿戴设备SLAM评估的空白，有助于推动更鲁棒的SLAM系统开发。

Abstract: Precise 6-DoF simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) from onboard
sensors is critical for wearable devices capturing egocentric data, which
exhibits specific challenges, such as a wider diversity of motions and
viewpoints, prevalent dynamic visual content, or long sessions affected by
time-varying sensor calibration. While recent progress on SLAM has been swift,
academic research is still driven by benchmarks that do not reflect these
challenges or do not offer sufficiently accurate ground truth poses. In this
paper, we introduce a new dataset and benchmark for visual-inertial SLAM with
egocentric, multi-modal data. We record hours and kilometers of trajectories
through a city center with glasses-like devices equipped with various sensors.
We leverage surveying tools to obtain control points as indirect pose
annotations that are metric, centimeter-accurate, and available at city scale.
This makes it possible to evaluate extreme trajectories that involve walking at
night or traveling in a vehicle. We show that state-of-the-art systems
developed by academia are not robust to these challenges and we identify
components that are responsible for this. In addition, we design tracks with
different levels of difficulty to ease in-depth analysis and evaluation of less
mature approaches. The dataset and benchmark are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态符号逻辑推理在自动驾驶和医疗诊断等高风险应用中至关重要，需要评估当前VLM在这方面的能力。

Method: 创建MuSLR基准数据集，包含原子符号逻辑和逻辑组合，评估7个SOTA VLM，并提出LogiCAM模块化框架应用形式逻辑规则。

Result: 所有VLM在多模态符号推理上都表现不佳，最佳模型GPT-4.1仅达到46.8%，LogiCAM将GPT-4.1的CoT性能提升了14.13%。

Conclusion: 当前VLM在多模态符号逻辑推理方面存在显著不足，约70%的失败源于模态间的逻辑不一致，LogiCAM框架能有效提升性能。

Abstract: Multimodal symbolic logical reasoning, which aims to deduce new facts from
multimodal input via formal logic, is critical in high-stakes applications such
as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis, as its rigorous, deterministic
reasoning helps prevent serious consequences. To evaluate such capabilities of
current state-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs), we introduce the first
benchmark MuSLR for multimodal symbolic logical reasoning grounded in formal
logical rules. MuSLR comprises 1,093 instances across 7 domains, including 35
atomic symbolic logic and 976 logical combinations, with reasoning depths
ranging from 2 to 9. We evaluate 7 state-of-the-art VLMs on MuSLR and find that
they all struggle with multimodal symbolic reasoning, with the best model,
GPT-4.1, achieving only 46.8%. Thus, we propose LogiCAM, a modular framework
that applies formal logical rules to multimodal inputs, boosting GPT-4.1's
Chain-of-Thought performance by 14.13%, and delivering even larger gains on
complex logics such as first-order logic. We also conduct a comprehensive error
analysis, showing that around 70% of failures stem from logical misalignment
between modalities, offering key insights to guide future improvements. All
data and code are publicly available at https://llm-symbol.github.io/MuSLR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工业异常检测主要依赖文本提示调优，而视觉处理部分分散且针对特定模型，缺乏统一框架。

Method: 构建基于补丁的视觉提示框架，包括对齐模块和前景掩码技术，无需训练即可进行异常检测。

Result: 在少样本和批量零样本场景下表现优于现有方法，即使不使用文本特征。分析了骨干网络结构和预训练特性对补丁相似性鲁棒性的影响。

Conclusion: 统一的纯补丁框架能够实现快速、轻量校准的部署，无需精心设计的文本提示。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection is increasingly relying on foundation models,
aiming for strong out-of-distribution generalization and rapid adaptation in
real-world deployments. Notably, past studies have primarily focused on textual
prompt tuning, leaving the intrinsic visual counterpart fragmented into
processing steps specific to each foundation model. We aim to address this
limitation by proposing a unified patch-focused framework, Patch-Exclusive
Anomaly Detection (PatchEAD), enabling training-free anomaly detection that is
compatible with diverse foundation models. The framework constructs visual
prompting techniques, including an alignment module and foreground masking. Our
experiments show superior few-shot and batch zero-shot performance compared to
prior work, despite the absence of textual features. Our study further examines
how backbone structure and pretrained characteristics affect patch-similarity
robustness, providing actionable guidance for selecting and configuring
foundation models for real-world visual inspection. These results confirm that
a well-unified patch-only framework can enable quick, calibration-light
deployment without the need for carefully engineered textual prompts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖切片级提示，无法捕捉组织学实体的亚型特异性表型变异，这些变异对癌症诊断至关重要

Method: 使用LLM生成实体级和切片级提示，通过实体引导交叉注意力模块生成实体级特征，开发跨尺度实体图学习模块丰富实体表示，最后结合实体级和切片级输出进行预测

Result: 在三个癌症队列上的结果证实了该方法在解决少样本病理诊断任务中的有效性

Conclusion: MAPLE框架通过整合多尺度视觉语义和分层预测，显著提升了少样本全切片图像分类的性能

Abstract: Prompt learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for adapting pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs) to few-shot whole slide image (WSI)
classification by aligning visual features with textual representations,
thereby reducing annotation cost and enhancing model generalization.
Nevertheless, existing methods typically rely on slide-level prompts and fail
to capture the subtype-specific phenotypic variations of histological entities
(\emph{e.g.,} nuclei, glands) that are critical for cancer diagnosis. To
address this gap, we propose Multi-scale Attribute-enhanced Prompt Learning
(\textbf{MAPLE}), a hierarchical framework for few-shot WSI classification that
jointly integrates multi-scale visual semantics and performs prediction at both
the entity and slide levels. Specifically, we first leverage large language
models (LLMs) to generate entity-level prompts that can help identify
multi-scale histological entities and their phenotypic attributes, as well as
slide-level prompts to capture global visual descriptions. Then, an
entity-guided cross-attention module is proposed to generate entity-level
features, followed by aligning with their corresponding subtype-specific
attributes for fine-grained entity-level prediction. To enrich entity
representations, we further develop a cross-scale entity graph learning module
that can update these representations by capturing their semantic correlations
within and across scales. The refined representations are then aggregated into
a slide-level representation and aligned with the corresponding prompts for
slide-level prediction. Finally, we combine both entity-level and slide-level
outputs to produce the final prediction results. Results on three cancer
cohorts confirm the effectiveness of our approach in addressing few-shot
pathology diagnosis tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推动"用图像思考"范式的发展，解决当前视觉语言模型在数据构建准确性、结构设计和应用场景方面的不足，提升多模态推理能力。

Method: 构建包含31k条思维链推理轨迹的数据集，设计直接在视觉嵌入空间生成视觉思维的模型，避免调用外部工具和重复编码图像。

Result: 在多模态推理基准测试中表现出强大性能，验证了数据集的有效性和模型设计的优越性。

Conclusion: DeepSketcher通过工具无关的灵活图像思考方式，为多模态推理提供了新的解决方案，展示了在视觉嵌入空间直接操作的潜力。

Abstract: The "thinking with images" paradigm represents a pivotal shift in the
reasoning of Vision Language Models (VLMs), moving from text-dominant
chain-of-thought to image-interactive reasoning. By invoking visual tools or
generating intermediate visual representations, VLMs can iteratively attend to
fine-grained regions, enabling deeper image understanding and more faithful
multimodal reasoning. As an emerging paradigm, however, it still leaves
substantial room for exploration in data construction accuracy, structural
design, and broader application scenarios, which offer rich opportunities for
advancing multimodal reasoning. To further advance this line of work, we
present DeepSketcher, a comprehensive suite comprising both an image-text
interleaved dataset and a self-contained model. The dataset contains 31k
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning trajectories with diverse tool calls and
resulting edited images, covering a wide range of data types and manipulation
instructions with high annotation accuracy. Building on this resource, we
design a model that performs interleaved image-text reasoning and natively
generates "visual thoughts" by operating directly in the visual embedding
space, rather than invoking external tools and repeatedly re-encoding generated
images. This design enables tool-free and more flexible "thinking with images".
Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate strong
performance, validating both the utility of the dataset and the effectiveness
of the model design.

Abstract: We introduce mpLLM, a prompt-conditioned hierarchical mixture-of-experts
(MoE) architecture for visual question answering over multi-parametric 3D brain
MRI (mpMRI). mpLLM routes across modality-level and token-level projection
experts to fuse multiple interrelated 3D modalities, enabling efficient
training without image--report pretraining. To address limited image-text
paired supervision, mpLLM integrates a synthetic visual question answering
(VQA) protocol that generates medically relevant VQA from segmentation
annotations, and we collaborate with medical experts for clinical validation.
mpLLM outperforms strong medical VLM baselines by 5.3% on average across
multiple mpMRI datasets. Our study features three main contributions: (1) the
first clinically validated VQA dataset for 3D brain mpMRI, (2) a novel
multimodal LLM that handles multiple interrelated 3D modalities, and (3) strong
empirical results that demonstrate the medical utility of our methodology.
Ablations highlight the importance of modality-level and token-level experts
and prompt-conditioned routing. We have included our source code in the

Conclusion: 该研究为多模态多轮对话安全提供了首个系统性框架和数据集，开发的LLaVAShield工具在内容审核方面表现优异，将公开发布数据集和模型以支持未来研究。

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) move into interactive, multi-turn use, new
safety risks arise that single-turn or single-modality moderation misses. In
Multimodal Multi-Turn (MMT) dialogues, malicious intent can be spread across
turns and images, while context-sensitive replies may still advance harmful
content. To address this challenge, we present the first systematic definition
and study of MMT dialogue safety. Building on this formulation, we introduce
the Multimodal Multi-turn Dialogue Safety (MMDS) dataset. We further develop an
automated multimodal multi-turn red-teaming framework based on Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to generate unsafe multimodal multi-turn dialogues for MMDS. MMDS
contains 4,484 annotated multimodal dialogue samples with fine-grained safety
ratings, policy dimension labels, and evidence-based rationales for both users
and assistants. Leveraging MMDS, we present LLaVAShield, a powerful tool that
jointly detects and assesses risk in user inputs and assistant responses.
Across comprehensive experiments, LLaVAShield consistently outperforms strong
baselines on MMT content moderation tasks and under dynamic policy
configurations, establishing new state-of-the-art results. We will publicly
release the dataset and model to support future research.

TL;DR: VLM-FO1是一个解决视觉语言模型在细粒度感知任务中定位能力不足的新框架，将对象感知从坐标生成问题转化为特征检索任务，通过混合细粒度区域编码器和基于token的引用系统实现精确的视觉定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型擅长高层次场景理解，但在需要精确定位的细粒度感知任务中表现不佳，因为语言中心架构难以生成精确的数值坐标。

Method: 提出VLM-FO1框架，包含混合细粒度区域编码器（HFRE）和基于token的引用系统。HFRE采用双视觉编码器生成富含语义和空间细节的区域token，使LLM能够基于这些视觉区域进行推理和定位。

Result: 实验表明VLM-FO1在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，在对象定位、区域生成理解和视觉区域推理方面表现出色。两阶段训练策略确保感知能力提升的同时不损害基础模型的通用视觉理解能力。

Conclusion: VLM-FO1为构建感知感知的视觉语言模型建立了有效且灵活的范式，弥合了高层次推理与细粒度视觉定位之间的差距。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at high-level scene understanding but
falter on fine-grained perception tasks requiring precise localization. This
failure stems from a fundamental mismatch, as generating exact numerical
coordinates is a challenging task for language-centric architectures. In this
paper, we introduce VLM-FO1, a novel framework that overcomes this limitation
by reframing object-centric perception from a brittle coordinate generation
problem into a robust feature retrieval task. Our method operates as a
plug-and-play module that integrates with any pre-trained VLM. It leverages a
Hybrid Fine-grained Region Encoder (HFRE), featuring a dual vision encoder, to
generate powerful region tokens rich in both semantic and spatial detail. A
token-based referencing system then enables the LLM to seamlessly reason about
and ground language in these specific visual regions. Experiments show that
VLM-FO1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse suite of
benchmarks, demonstrating exceptional capabilities in object grounding, region
generational understanding, and visual region reasoning. Crucially, our
two-stage training strategy ensures that these perception gains are achieved
without compromising the base model's general visual understanding
capabilities. VLM-FO1 establishes an effective and flexible paradigm for
building perception-aware VLMs, bridging the gap between high-level reasoning
and fine-grained visual grounding.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了36种最先进视觉模型在对抗攻击下的鲁棒性，发现对抗鲁棒性遵循数据量和模型规模的对数缩放定律，但数据质量、架构和训练目标比原始规模对实现广泛对抗韧性更为关键。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络尽管在架构和训练范式上有所进步，但仍然容易受到对抗样本的攻击。研究旨在探索训练数据特征如何影响对抗鲁棒性。

Method: 评估了36种最先进的视觉模型，包括监督学习、自监督学习和对比学习方法，训练数据集规模从120万到220亿张图像。在六种黑盒攻击类别下进行评估：随机扰动、两种几何掩码、COCO对象操作、ImageNet-C损坏和ImageNet-R风格变换。

Result: 对抗鲁棒性遵循数据量和模型规模的对数缩放定律：数据量增加十倍，攻击成功率平均降低约3.2%；模型规模增加十倍，攻击成功率平均降低约13.4%。一些在精选数据集上训练的自监督模型（如DINOv2）表现优于在更大但质量较低数据集上训练的模型。

Conclusion: 虽然扩展规模可以提高鲁棒性，但数据质量、架构和训练目标在实现广泛对抗韧性方面比原始规模起着更决定性的作用。

Abstract: Deep neural networks remain vulnerable to adversarial examples despite
advances in architectures and training paradigms. We investigate how training
data characteristics affect adversarial robustness across 36 state-of-the-art
vision models spanning supervised, self-supervised, and contrastive learning
approaches, trained on datasets from 1.2M to 22B images. Models were evaluated
under six black-box attack categories: random perturbations, two types of
geometric masks, COCO object manipulations, ImageNet-C corruptions, and
ImageNet-R style shifts. Robustness follows a logarithmic scaling law with both
data volume and model size: a tenfold increase in data reduces attack success
rate (ASR) on average by ~3.2%, whereas a tenfold increase in model size
reduces ASR on average by ~13.4%. Notably, some self-supervised models trained
on curated datasets, such as DINOv2, outperform others trained on much larger
but less curated datasets, challenging the assumption that scale alone drives
robustness. Adversarial fine-tuning of ResNet50s improves generalization across
structural variations but not across color distributions. Human evaluation
reveals persistent gaps between human and machine vision. These results show
that while scaling improves robustness, data quality, architecture, and
training objectives play a more decisive role than raw scale in achieving
broad-spectrum adversarial resilience.

Conclusion: UniMMAD通过统一框架解决了多模态多类别异常检测中的碎片化问题和跨域变化挑战，同时保持了高效性。

Abstract: Existing anomaly detection (AD) methods often treat the modality and class as
independent factors. Although this paradigm has enriched the development of AD
research branches and produced many specialized models, it has also led to
fragmented solutions and excessive memory overhead. Moreover,
reconstruction-based multi-class approaches typically rely on shared decoding
paths, which struggle to handle large variations across domains, resulting in
distorted normality boundaries, domain interference, and high false alarm
rates. To address these limitations, we propose UniMMAD, a unified framework
for multi-modal and multi-class anomaly detection. At the core of UniMMAD is a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-driven feature decompression mechanism, which enables
adaptive and disentangled reconstruction tailored to specific domains. This
process is guided by a ``general to specific'' paradigm. In the encoding stage,
multi-modal inputs of varying combinations are compressed into compact,
general-purpose features. The encoder incorporates a feature compression module
to suppress latent anomalies, encourage cross-modal interaction, and avoid
shortcut learning. In the decoding stage, the general features are decompressed
into modality-specific and class-specific forms via a sparsely-gated cross MoE,
which dynamically selects expert pathways based on input modality and class. To
further improve efficiency, we design a grouped dynamic filtering mechanism and
a MoE-in-MoE structure, reducing parameter usage by 75\% while maintaining
sparse activation and fast inference. UniMMAD achieves state-of-the-art
performance on 9 anomaly detection datasets, spanning 3 fields, 12 modalities,
and 66 classes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CO3方法改进多概念提示在文本到图像扩散模型中的保真度，通过校正采样策略避免概念重叠过强区域，实现更好的概念平衡和覆盖


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多概念提示（如"猫和狗"）在扩散模型中常见失败情况，避免概念缺失、模糊或冲突的问题，改善语义对齐的脆弱性

Method: 引入校正采样策略，引导模型远离联合提示行为与单个概念重叠过强的区域，向所有概念平衡共存的"纯"联合模式引导，无需重新训练模型

Result: 在多样化多概念提示上的实验表明，相比标准基线和现有组合方法，在概念覆盖、平衡和鲁棒性方面有改进，减少了概念丢失或扭曲

Conclusion: 轻量级校正引导可以显著缓解现代扩散系统中脆弱的语义对齐行为，该方法即插即用，无需模型调优，可与标准无分类器引导互补

Abstract: We propose to improve multi-concept prompt fidelity in text-to-image
diffusion models. We begin with common failure cases-prompts like "a cat and a
dog" that sometimes yields images where one concept is missing, faint, or
colliding awkwardly with another. We hypothesize that this happens when the
diffusion model drifts into mixed modes that over-emphasize a single concept it
learned strongly during training. Instead of re-training, we introduce a
corrective sampling strategy that steers away from regions where the joint
prompt behavior overlaps too strongly with any single concept in the prompt.
The goal is to steer towards "pure" joint modes where all concepts can coexist
with balanced visual presence. We further show that existing multi-concept
guidance schemes can operate in unstable weight regimes that amplify imbalance;
we characterize favorable regions and adapt sampling to remain within them. Our
approach, CO3, is plug-and-play, requires no model tuning, and complements
standard classifier-free guidance. Experiments on diverse multi-concept prompts
indicate improvements in concept coverage, balance and robustness, with fewer
dropped or distorted concepts compared to standard baselines and prior
compositional methods. Results suggest that lightweight corrective guidance can
substantially mitigate brittle semantic alignment behavior in modern diffusion
systems.

TL;DR: 提出SS-ACL框架，通过无监督解剖一致性学习实现医学报告生成，无需专家标注，在准确性和临床效果上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有医学报告生成方法依赖单独训练检测模块、需要大量专家标注、标注成本高且因病理分布偏差导致泛化性受限的问题。

Method: 基于人体解剖不变性构建分层解剖图，通过递归重构细粒度解剖区域实现空间对齐，结合区域级对比学习增强语义对齐，使用对齐嵌入作为报告生成先验。

Result: 在词汇准确性上超越SOTA方法10%，临床效果提升25%，在零样本视觉定位任务上超越领先视觉基础模型8%。

Conclusion: SS-ACL框架无需专家标注即可生成准确且视觉可解释的医学报告，在多个下游视觉任务上表现优异，具有很好的临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Vision-grounded medical report generation aims to produce clinically accurate
descriptions of medical images, anchored in explicit visual evidence to improve
interpretability and facilitate integration into clinical workflows. However,
existing methods often rely on separately trained detection modules that
require extensive expert annotations, introducing high labeling costs and
limiting generalizability due to pathology distribution bias across datasets.
To address these challenges, we propose Self-Supervised Anatomical Consistency
Learning (SS-ACL) -- a novel and annotation-free framework that aligns
generated reports with corresponding anatomical regions using simple textual
prompts. SS-ACL constructs a hierarchical anatomical graph inspired by the
invariant top-down inclusion structure of human anatomy, organizing entities by
spatial location. It recursively reconstructs fine-grained anatomical regions
to enforce intra-sample spatial alignment, inherently guiding attention maps
toward visually relevant areas prompted by text. To further enhance
inter-sample semantic alignment for abnormality recognition, SS-ACL introduces
a region-level contrastive learning based on anatomical consistency. These
aligned embeddings serve as priors for report generation, enabling attention
maps to provide interpretable visual evidence. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SS-ACL, without relying on expert annotations, (i) generates
accurate and visually grounded reports -- outperforming state-of-the-art
methods by 10\% in lexical accuracy and 25\% in clinical efficacy, and (ii)
achieves competitive performance on various downstream visual tasks, surpassing
current leading visual foundation models by 8\% in zero-shot visual grounding.

Motivation: 现有计算机视觉方法只能单独计算福利指标，且在水下鲑鱼场景中易受遮挡、外观相似和运动相似等问题影响，需要更高效的自动化监测方案。

Method: 使用姿态估计网络提取鲑鱼及其身体部位的边界框，通过专门模块利用身体部位信息解决水下跟踪难题，基于高细节身体部位轨迹计算福利指标。

Conclusion: 该方法为工业水产养殖网箱中的鲑鱼福利监测提供了灵活有效的解决方案，能够应对水下环境的特殊挑战。

Abstract: Computer Vision (CV)-based continuous, automated and precise salmon welfare
monitoring is a key step toward reduced salmon mortality and improved salmon
welfare in industrial aquaculture net pens. Available CV methods for
determining welfare indicators focus on single indicators and rely on object
detectors and trackers from other application areas to aid their welfare
indicator calculation algorithm. This comes with a high resource demand for
real-world applications, since each indicator must be calculated separately. In
addition, the methods are vulnerable to difficulties in underwater salmon
scenes, such as object occlusion, similar object appearance, and similar object
motion. To address these challenges, we propose a flexible tracking framework
that uses a pose estimation network to extract bounding boxes around salmon and
their corresponding body parts, and exploits information about the body parts,
through specialized modules, to tackle challenges specific to underwater salmon
scenes. Subsequently, the high-detail body part tracks are employed to
calculate welfare indicators. We construct two novel datasets assessing two
salmon tracking challenges: salmon ID transfers in crowded scenes and salmon ID
switches during turning. Our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art
pedestrian tracker, BoostTrack, for both salmon tracking challenges.
Additionally, we create a dataset for calculating salmon tail beat wavelength,
demonstrating that our body part tracking method is well-suited for automated
welfare monitoring based on tail beat analysis. Datasets and code are available

Method: 开发了新的3D数据合成流水线来创建大规模场景级数据集，并提出了基于少量用户点点击的交互式分割框架。

Conclusion: 该工作代表了在复杂3D环境中实现更细致和精确的机器感知与交互的重要进展。

Abstract: Fine-grained 3D part segmentation is crucial for enabling embodied AI systems
to perform complex manipulation tasks, such as interacting with specific
functional components of an object. However, existing interactive segmentation
methods are largely confined to coarse, instance-level targets, while
non-interactive approaches struggle with sparse, real-world scans and suffer
from a severe lack of annotated data. To address these limitations, we
introduce PinPoint3D, a novel interactive framework for fine-grained,
multi-granularity 3D segmentation, capable of generating precise part-level
masks from only a few user point clicks. A key component of our work is a new
3D data synthesis pipeline that we developed to create a large-scale,
scene-level dataset with dense part annotations, overcoming a critical
bottleneck that has hindered progress in this field. Through comprehensive
experiments and user studies, we demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing approaches, achieving an average IoU of around 55.8% on
each object part under first-click settings and surpassing 71.3% IoU with only
a few additional clicks. Compared to current state-of-the-art baselines,
PinPoint3D yields up to a 16% improvement in IoU and precision, highlighting
its effectiveness on challenging, sparse point clouds with high efficiency. Our
work represents a significant step towards more nuanced and precise machine
perception and interaction in complex 3D environments.

Motivation: 当前视觉上下文学习方法基于相似性优先假设选择上下文示例，但该假设缺乏充分的理论依据。同时，Partial2Global方法依赖随机采样构建全局排序，导致覆盖不完整和冗余采样，影响最终排序质量。

Method: 提出了RH-Partial2Global方法：1）使用jackknife保形预测构建可靠的替代集合；2）采用基于覆盖设计的采样方法，确保成对偏好的全面均匀覆盖。

Conclusion: RH-Partial2Global通过可靠的替代集合构建和全面的采样策略，有效提升了视觉上下文学习中示例选择的可靠性和完整性，为视觉基础模型的适应提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) has emerged as a prominent approach for
adapting visual foundation models to novel tasks, by effectively exploiting
contextual information embedded in in-context examples, which can be formulated
as a global ranking problem of potential candidates. Current VICL methods, such
as Partial2Global and VPR, are grounded in the similarity-priority assumption
that images more visually similar to a query image serve as better in-context
examples. This foundational assumption, while intuitive, lacks sufficient
justification for its efficacy in selecting optimal in-context examples.
Furthermore, Partial2Global constructs its global ranking from a series of
randomly sampled pairwise preference predictions. Such a reliance on random
sampling can lead to incomplete coverage and redundant samplings of
comparisons, thus further adversely impacting the final global ranking. To
address these issues, this paper introduces an enhanced variant of
Partial2Global designed for reliable and holistic selection of in-context
examples in VICL. Our proposed method, dubbed RH-Partial2Global, leverages a
jackknife conformal prediction-guided strategy to construct reliable
alternative sets and a covering design-based sampling approach to ensure
comprehensive and uniform coverage of pairwise preferences. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that RH-Partial2Global achieves excellent performance
and outperforms Partial2Global across diverse visual tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编辑模型因传统注意力机制的二次计算复杂度，难以处理长时长和高分辨率视频，限制了实时视频处理等实际应用。

Method: 将线性时空聚合模块集成到视频扩散模型中，利用RWKV变换器的双向加权键值递归机制捕获全局依赖并保持时间一致性，实现线性复杂度。

Result: 实验显示该方法比最先进的基于扩散的视频编辑方法快3.7倍，内存使用降低60%，在帧一致性和文本对齐方面保持竞争力。

Conclusion: VRWKV-Editor在长视频编辑中相比自注意力架构具有显著速度优势，为高效视频编辑提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: In light of recent progress in video editing, deep learning models focusing
on both spatial and temporal dependencies have emerged as the primary method.
However, these models suffer from the quadratic computational complexity of
traditional attention mechanisms, making them difficult to adapt to
long-duration and high-resolution videos. This limitation restricts their
applicability in practical contexts such as real-time video processing. To
tackle this challenge, we introduce a method to reduce both time and space
complexity of these systems by proposing VRWKV-Editor, a novel video editing
model that integrates a linear spatio-temporal aggregation module into
video-based diffusion models. VRWKV-Editor leverages bidirectional weighted
key-value recurrence mechanism of the RWKV transformer to capture global
dependencies while preserving temporal coherence, achieving linear complexity
without sacrificing quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves up to 3.7x speedup and 60% lower memory usage compared
to state-of-the-art diffusion-based video editing methods, while maintaining
competitive performance in frame consistency and text alignment. Furthermore, a
comparative analysis we conducted on videos with different sequence lengths
confirms that the gap in editing speed between our approach and architectures
with self-attention becomes more significant with long videos.

Result: 在EPIC-Kitchens和Ego4D数据集上，WISH超越了所有基线方法，恢复了完全监督方法50%以上的性能

Conclusion: 叙述监督为手部物体分割提供了一种有效的弱监督方法，显著减少了标注成本

Abstract: Pixel-level recognition of objects manipulated by the user from egocentric
images enables key applications spanning assistive technologies, industrial
safety, and activity monitoring. However, progress in this area is currently
hindered by the scarcity of annotated datasets, as existing approaches rely on
costly manual labels. In this paper, we propose to learn human-object
interaction detection leveraging narrations -- natural language descriptions of
the actions performed by the camera wearer which contain clues about
manipulated objects (e.g., "I am pouring vegetables from the chopping board to
the pan"). Narrations provide a form of weak supervision that is cheap to
acquire and readily available in state-of-the-art egocentric datasets. We
introduce Narration-Supervised in-Hand Object Segmentation (NS-iHOS), a novel
task where models have to learn to segment in-hand objects by learning from
natural-language narrations. Narrations are then not employed at inference
time. We showcase the potential of the task by proposing Weakly-Supervised
In-hand Object Segmentation from Human Narrations (WISH), an end-to-end model
distilling knowledge from narrations to learn plausible hand-object
associations and enable in-hand object segmentation without using narrations at
test time. We benchmark WISH against different baselines based on
open-vocabulary object detectors and vision-language models, showing the
superiority of its design. Experiments on EPIC-Kitchens and Ego4D show that
WISH surpasses all baselines, recovering more than 50% of the performance of
fully supervised methods, without employing fine-grained pixel-wise
annotations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IQA方法使用固定模型输出标量分数，难以适应多样化失真、用户特定查询和可解释性需求，且评分与解释通常分离处理。

Method: AgenticIQA将IQA分解为四个子任务：失真检测、失真分析、工具选择和工具执行，由规划器、执行器和总结器协调完成。

Result: 在多个IQA数据集上的广泛实验表明，AgenticIQA在评分准确性和解释对齐性方面均优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: AgenticIQA框架通过整合VLMs和传统IQA工具，实现了更准确、可解释的图像质量评估，并提供了首个用于评估VLM基IQA代理的基准。

Abstract: Image quality assessment (IQA) is inherently complex, as it reflects both the
quantification and interpretation of perceptual quality rooted in the human
visual system. Conventional approaches typically rely on fixed models to output
scalar scores, limiting their adaptability to diverse distortions,
user-specific queries, and interpretability needs. Furthermore, scoring and
interpretation are often treated as independent processes, despite their
interdependence: interpretation identifies perceptual degradations, while
scoring abstracts them into a compact metric. To address these limitations, we
propose AgenticIQA, a modular agentic framework that integrates vision-language
models (VLMs) with traditional IQA tools in a dynamic, query-aware manner.
AgenticIQA decomposes IQA into four subtasks -- distortion detection,
distortion analysis, tool selection, and tool execution -- coordinated by a
planner, executor, and summarizer. The planner formulates task-specific
strategies, the executor collects perceptual evidence via tool invocation, and
the summarizer integrates this evidence to produce accurate scores with
human-aligned explanations. To support training and evaluation, we introduce
AgenticIQA-200K, a large-scale instruction dataset tailored for IQA agents, and
AgenticIQA-Eval, the first benchmark for assessing the planning, execution, and
summarization capabilities of VLM-based IQA agents. Extensive experiments
across diverse IQA datasets demonstrate that AgenticIQA consistently surpasses
strong baselines in both scoring accuracy and explanatory alignment.

Motivation: 利用针孔和鱼眼图像的互补特性进行联合优化，解决异构多视角深度估计问题。针孔图像无畸变但视野小，鱼眼图像有畸变但视野大，两者结合可提供更全面的场景覆盖。

Method: 1) 将异构视图的2D特征显式提升到规范3D体积空间；2) 设计异构空间融合模块处理融合畸变感知的体积特征；3) 将传统体素融合重新表述为3D高斯表示，使用可学习潜在高斯球动态适应局部图像纹理；4) 将融合的体积特征渲染为多视角深度图。

Result: 在KITTI-360和RealHet数据集上实现了最先进的性能，超越了当前主流深度网络。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统研究异构针孔-鱼眼深度估计的工作，提供了技术新颖性和有价值的实证见解。

Abstract: In this paper, we present the first pinhole-fisheye framework for
heterogeneous multi-view depth estimation, PFDepth. Our key insight is to
exploit the complementary characteristics of pinhole and fisheye imagery
(undistorted vs. distorted, small vs. large FOV, far vs. near field) for joint
optimization. PFDepth employs a unified architecture capable of processing
arbitrary combinations of pinhole and fisheye cameras with varied intrinsics
and extrinsics. Within PFDepth, we first explicitly lift 2D features from each
heterogeneous view into a canonical 3D volumetric space. Then, a core module
termed Heterogeneous Spatial Fusion is designed to process and fuse
distortion-aware volumetric features across overlapping and non-overlapping
regions. Additionally, we subtly reformulate the conventional voxel fusion into
a novel 3D Gaussian representation, in which learnable latent Gaussian spheres
dynamically adapt to local image textures for finer 3D aggregation. Finally,
fused volume features are rendered into multi-view depth maps. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that PFDepth sets a state-of-the-art
performance on KITTI-360 and RealHet datasets over current mainstream depth
networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of
heterogeneous pinhole-fisheye depth estimation, offering both technical novelty
and valuable empirical insights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的二阶PDE模型在去噪早期阶段会产生块状伪影，需要开发更有效的模型来同时抑制噪声和保留细节。

Method: 采用四阶非线性PDE模型，扩散过程由拉普拉斯算子和强度值共同引导，波动部分保持精细细节和纹理，并将模型扩展到彩色图像处理。

Result: 在PSNR、MSSIM和SI等指标上均优于现有的二阶各向异性扩散方法，在灰度图像和彩色图像上都取得了更好的去噪效果。

Conclusion: 所提出的四阶PDE模型在抑制乘性噪声方面比传统二阶模型更有效，能够更好地平衡噪声抑制和细节保留。

Abstract: Second-order PDE models have been widely used for suppressing multiplicative
noise, but they often introduce blocky artifacts in the early stages of
denoising. To resolve this, we propose a fourth-order nonlinear PDE model that
integrates diffusion and wave properties. The diffusion process, guided by both
the Laplacian and intensity values, reduces noise better than gradient-based
methods, while the wave part keeps fine details and textures. The effectiveness
of the proposed model is evaluated against two second-order anisotropic
diffusion approaches using the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean
Structural Similarity Index (MSSIM) for images with available ground truth. For
SAR images, where a noise-free reference is unavailable, the Speckle Index (SI)
is used to measure noise reduction. Additionally, we extend the proposed model
to study color images by applying the denoising process independently to each
channel, preserving both structure and color consistency. The same quantitative
metrics PSNR and MSSIM are used for performance evaluation, ensuring a fair
comparison across grayscale and color images. In all the cases, our computed
results produce better results compared to existing models in this genre.

TL;DR: SETR提出了一种两阶段检索方法解决零样本组合图像检索问题，通过交集驱动策略过滤干扰信息，并使用多模态LLM进行细粒度重排序，在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有CLIP方法在零样本组合图像检索中的两个核心问题：基于并集的特征融合会携带不相关的背景细节，以及全局余弦相似度无法解析细粒度语义关系。

Method: 提出两阶段检索框架：粗检索阶段使用交集驱动策略保留参考图像和相对文本的重叠语义；细粒度重排序阶段使用LoRA适配的多模态LLM进行二元语义相关性判断。

Result: 在CIRR、Fashion-IQ和CIRCO数据集上达到新的SOTA性能，在CIRR上Recall@1提升高达15.15个百分点。

Conclusion: 两阶段推理是构建鲁棒且可移植的零样本组合图像检索的通用范式。

Abstract: Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) aims to retrieve a target image
given a reference image and a relative text, without relying on costly triplet
annotations. Existing CLIP-based methods face two core challenges: (1)
union-based feature fusion indiscriminately aggregates all visual cues,
carrying over irrelevant background details that dilute the intended
modification, and (2) global cosine similarity from CLIP embeddings lacks the
ability to resolve fine-grained semantic relations. To address these issues, we
propose SETR (Semantic-enhanced Two-Stage Retrieval). In the coarse retrieval
stage, SETR introduces an intersection-driven strategy that retains only the
overlapping semantics between the reference image and relative text, thereby
filtering out distractors inherent to union-based fusion and producing a
cleaner, high-precision candidate set. In the fine-grained re-ranking stage, we
adapt a pretrained multimodal LLM with Low-Rank Adaptation to conduct binary
semantic relevance judgments ("Yes/No"), which goes beyond CLIP's global
feature matching by explicitly verifying relational and attribute-level
consistency. Together, these two stages form a complementary pipeline: coarse
retrieval narrows the candidate pool with high recall, while re-ranking ensures
precise alignment with nuanced textual modifications. Experiments on CIRR,
Fashion-IQ, and CIRCO show that SETR achieves new state-of-the-art performance,
improving Recall@1 on CIRR by up to 15.15 points. Our results establish
two-stage reasoning as a general paradigm for robust and portable ZS-CIR.

Motivation: 解决遥感与OSM数据之间的模态差异（数据结构、内容和空间粒度不同），实现有效的多模态协同，以推进地理空间智能和广泛任务支持。

Method: 在预训练阶段使用OSM数据提供多粒度学习信号，通过跨模态空间相关性指导信息交互；引入图像掩码重建实现稀疏输入高效预训练；在下游任务中生成单模态和多模态细粒度编码。

Abstract: Integrating ground-level geospatial data with rich geographic context, like
OpenStreetMap (OSM), into remote sensing (RS) foundation models (FMs) is
essential for advancing geospatial intelligence and supporting a broad spectrum
of tasks. However, modality gap between RS and OSM data, including differences
in data structure, content, and spatial granularity, makes effective synergy
highly challenging, and most existing RS FMs focus on imagery alone. To this
end, this study presents GeoLink, a multimodal framework that leverages OSM
data to enhance RS FM during both the pretraining and downstream task stages.
Specifically, GeoLink enhances RS self-supervised pretraining using
multi-granularity learning signals derived from OSM data, guided by cross-modal
spatial correlations for information interaction and collaboration. It also
introduces image mask-reconstruction to enable sparse input for efficient
pretraining. For downstream tasks, GeoLink generates both unimodal and
multimodal fine-grained encodings to support a wide range of applications, from
common RS interpretation tasks like land cover classification to more
comprehensive geographic tasks like urban function zone mapping. Extensive
experiments show that incorporating OSM data during pretraining enhances the
performance of the RS image encoder, while fusing RS and OSM data in downstream
tasks improves the FM's adaptability to complex geographic scenarios. These
results underscore the potential of multimodal synergy in advancing high-level

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PatchVSR方法，利用视频扩散先验进行分块视频超分辨率，通过双流适配器结合局部补丁特征和全局上下文特征，实现高效高保真的4K视频超分辨率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于预训练视频生成模型的视频超分辨率方法存在全注意力计算开销大和输出分辨率固定的问题，需要探索更高效的补丁级超分辨率方法。

Method: 提出PatchVSR方法，包含双流适配器（补丁分支提取局部特征，全局分支提取上下文特征），注入位置信息，以及多补丁联合调制确保视觉一致性。

Result: 实验表明该方法能在补丁级别合成高保真、高分辨率细节，基于512x512基础模型实现竞争性的4K视频超分辨率，且效率极高。

Conclusion: 补丁级视频超分辨率范式具有灵活性，能够高效利用预训练视频扩散模型实现高质量的超分辨率效果。

Abstract: Pre-trained video generation models hold great potential for generative video
super-resolution (VSR). However, adapting them for full-size VSR, as most
existing methods do, suffers from unnecessary intensive full-attention
computation and fixed output resolution. To overcome these limitations, we make
the first exploration into utilizing video diffusion priors for patch-wise VSR.
This is non-trivial because pre-trained video diffusion models are not native
for patch-level detail generation. To mitigate this challenge, we propose an
innovative approach, called PatchVSR, which integrates a dual-stream adapter
for conditional guidance. The patch branch extracts features from input patches
to maintain content fidelity while the global branch extracts context features
from the resized full video to bridge the generation gap caused by incomplete
semantics of patches. Particularly, we also inject the patch's location
information into the model to better contextualize patch synthesis within the
global video frame. Experiments demonstrate that our method can synthesize
high-fidelity, high-resolution details at the patch level. A tailor-made
multi-patch joint modulation is proposed to ensure visual consistency across
individually enhanced patches. Due to the flexibility of our patch-based
paradigm, we can achieve highly competitive 4K VSR based on a 512x512
resolution base model, with extremely high efficiency.

*Haoran Pei,Yuguang Yang,Kexin Liu,Baochang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CGP框架，通过基于ViT的因果掩码引导高斯扰动，增强OOD泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习中OOD泛化问题，特别是在生物医学图像领域，现有方法可能忽略因果机制

Method: 使用Vision Transformers生成软因果掩码，在输入图像中注入空间变化的高斯噪声，对背景区域施加更强扰动

Result: 在Camelyon17基准测试中优于现有OOD方法

Conclusion: 因果扰动是实现可靠和可解释泛化的有效工具

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization remains a central challenge in
deploying deep learning models to real-world scenarios, particularly in domains
such as biomedical images, where distribution shifts are both subtle and
pervasive. While existing methods often pursue domain invariance through
complex generative models or adversarial training, these approaches may
overlook the underlying causal mechanisms of generalization.In this work, we
propose Causally-Guided Gaussian Perturbations (CGP)-a lightweight framework
that enhances OOD generalization by injecting spatially varying noise into
input images, guided by soft causal masks derived from Vision Transformers. By
applying stronger perturbations to background regions and weaker ones to
foreground areas, CGP encourages the model to rely on causally relevant
features rather than spurious correlations.Experimental results on the
challenging WILDS benchmark Camelyon17 demonstrate consistent performance gains
over state-of-the-art OOD baselines, highlighting the potential of causal
perturbation as a tool for reliable and interpretable generalization.

*Christoph Timmermann,Hyunse Lee,Woojin Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeMoBridge通过语义模态桥将图像映射到文本模态，解决CLIP在少样本分类中的模态内不对齐问题，在低数据场景下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在零样本任务中表现良好，但在少样本分类中由于模态内不对齐问题（持续模态间隙和仅跨模态训练目标）导致性能受限，现有方法要么优化相似度对数，要么进行计算昂贵的逐样本优化。

Method: 提出SeMoBridge方法，通过语义模态桥将图像映射到文本模态，保持语义内容不变。该方法为闭式解，可选择通过多模态监督训练，结合图像和文本对齐损失来优化投影。

Result: 实验表明，训练版本SeMoBridge-T仅需少量训练时间，整体性能优于其他方法，在低数据场景（1、2、4样本）表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: SeMoBridge是一种轻量级但强大的方法，直接解决了CLIP在少样本分类中的模态内不对齐问题，在低数据场景下具有显著优势。

Abstract: While Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) excels at zero-shot tasks
by aligning image and text embeddings, its performance in few-shot
classification is hindered by a critical limitation: intra-modal misalignment.
This issue, caused by a persistent modality gap and CLIP's exclusively
inter-modal training objective, leaves the embedding spaces uncalibrated,
making direct image-to-image comparisons unreliable. Existing methods attempt
to address this by refining similarity logits or by computationally expensive
per-sample optimization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SeMoBridge,
a lightweight yet powerful approach that directly addresses the misalignment.
Our method maps images into the text modality, while keeping their semantic
content intact through what we call a Semantic Modality Bridge. SeMoBridge is
closed-form and can optionally be trained through multi-modal supervision,
combining image and text-alignment losses to optimize the projection.
Experiments show that the trained version, SeMoBridge-T, requires only a
fraction of the training time while overall outperforming other methods,
particularly in low-data scenarios (1, 2, and 4 shots). The code is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 扩展HAMMER模型以处理全局场景不一致性，通过分割引导评分方法提升多模态篡改检测的鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HAMMER在多模态篡改检测中表现优异，但在处理前景-背景不匹配等全局场景不一致时存在局限，需要改进

Method: 提出轻量级分割引导评分(SGS)管道，使用人物/面部分割掩码分离前景和背景区域，提取嵌入特征并计算区域感知一致性分数

Result: SGS显著增强了HAMMER对全局篡改的检测鲁棒性，改善了二元检测、定位和标记级解释，计算开销可忽略

Conclusion: 区域感知推理在多模态虚假信息检测中至关重要，SGS方法无需重新训练即可有效提升模型性能

Abstract: We extend HAMMER, a state-of-the-art model for multimodal manipulation
detection, to handle global scene inconsistencies such as foreground-background
(FG-BG) mismatch. While HAMMER achieves strong performance on the DGM4 dataset,
it consistently fails when the main subject is contextually misplaced into an
implausible background. We diagnose this limitation as a combination of
label-space bias, local attention focus, and spurious text-foreground
alignment. To remedy this without retraining, we propose a lightweight
segmentation-guided scoring (SGS) pipeline. SGS uses person/face segmentation
masks to separate foreground and background regions, extracts embeddings with a
joint vision-language model, and computes region-aware coherence scores. These
scores are fused with HAMMER's original prediction to improve binary detection,
grounding, and token-level explanations. SGS is inference-only, incurs
negligible computational overhead, and significantly enhances robustness to
global manipulations. This work demonstrates the importance of region-aware
reasoning in multimodal disinformation detection. We release scripts for
segmentation and scoring at https://github.com/Gaganx0/HAMMER-sgs

TL;DR: 本文扩展了DGM4数据集，新增了5000个包含前景-背景不匹配及其与文本操作混合的高质量样本，创建了DGM4+基准数据集，用于测试检测器在局部和全局推理上的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型的快速发展使得制作令人信服的多模态虚假信息变得容易，而现有的DGM4数据集仅限于局部操作，无法覆盖真实伪造中普遍存在的前景-背景不匹配等全局不一致性问题。

Method: 使用OpenAI的gpt-image-1和精心设计的提示生成以人为中心的新闻风格图像，将真实人物置于荒谬或不可能的背景下，并生成三种类型的标题：字面描述、文本属性和文本分割，形成三种新的操作类别。

Result: 创建了包含FG-BG、FG-BG+TA和FG-BG+TS三种操作类别的5000个高质量样本，通过质量控制管道确保数据质量，包括可见人脸数量控制、感知哈希去重、基于OCR的文本清理和真实标题长度。

Conclusion: DGM4+数据集填补了现有数据集在全局操作方面的空白，为多模态模型（如HAMMER）的评估提供了更全面的基准，这些模型目前在前景-背景不一致性检测方面存在困难。

Abstract: The rapid advances in generative models have significantly lowered the
barrier to producing convincing multimodal disinformation. Fabricated images
and manipulated captions increasingly co-occur to create persuasive false
narratives. While the Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation
(DGM4) dataset established a foundation for research in this area, it is
restricted to local manipulations such as face swaps, attribute edits, and
caption changes. This leaves a critical gap: global inconsistencies, such as
mismatched foregrounds and backgrounds, which are now prevalent in real-world
forgeries. To address this, we extend DGM4 with 5,000 high-quality samples that
introduce Foreground-Background (FG-BG) mismatches and their hybrids with text
manipulations. Using OpenAI's gpt-image-1 and carefully designed prompts, we
generate human-centric news-style images where authentic figures are placed
into absurd or impossible backdrops (e.g., a teacher calmly addressing students
on the surface of Mars). Captions are produced under three conditions: literal,
text attribute, and text split, yielding three new manipulation categories:
FG-BG, FG-BG+TA, and FG-BG+TS. Quality control pipelines enforce one-to-three
visible faces, perceptual hash deduplication, OCR-based text scrubbing, and
realistic headline length. By introducing global manipulations, our extension
complements existing datasets, creating a benchmark DGM4+ that tests detectors
on both local and global reasoning. This resource is intended to strengthen
evaluation of multimodal models such as HAMMER, which currently struggle with
FG-BG inconsistencies. We release our DGM4+ dataset and generation script at
https://github.com/Gaganx0/DGM4plus

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于主纤维丛截面概念的新方法，用于消除计算机视觉和医学应用中的对称性，避免传统数据增强方法，构建更可持续的算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机视觉和医学数据集通常包含对称性（如旋转、缩放等），传统方法使用数据增强来学习这些对称性，但这种方法效率低下且不够可持续。

Method: 使用主纤维丛的截面概念来模除对称性，通过优化截面来最大化类别分离，并在对象轮廓数据集上应用平移、旋转、缩放和重参数化等对称群。

Result: 开发了一个包含恒定速度参数化作为特例的2参数曲线规范参数化族，该方法能够有效测量对称群作用下对象轨道之间的差异。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种简单有效的几何学习框架，避免了数据增强的需求，具有广泛的应用潜力，相关代码已开源。

Abstract: Most datasets encountered in computer vision and medical applications present
symmetries that should be taken into account in classification tasks. A typical
example is the symmetry by rotation and/or scaling in object detection. A
common way to build neural networks that learn the symmetries is to use data
augmentation. In order to avoid data augmentation and build more sustainable
algorithms, we present an alternative method to mod out symmetries based on the
notion of section of a principal fiber bundle. This framework allows the use of
simple metrics on the space of objects in order to measure dissimilarities
between orbits of objects under the symmetry group. Moreover, the section used
can be optimized to maximize separation of classes. We illustrate this
methodology on a dataset of contours of objects for the groups of translations,
rotations, scalings and reparameterizations. In particular, we present a
$2$-parameter family of canonical parameterizations of curves, containing the
constant-speed parameterization as a special case, which we believe is
interesting in its own right. We hope that this simple application will serve
to convey the geometric concepts underlying this method, which have a wide
range of possible applications. The code is available at the following link:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督方法如新视角合成等计算成本高、内存占用大，且难以迁移到其他架构。需要一种更高效、可迁移的解决方案。

Method: 使用Grounded-SAM和Metric3Dv2基础模型生成3D伪标签，利用时序信息进行标签稠密化，提出简化模型EasyOcc仅从伪标签学习。

Result: 在OccNeRF中mIoU从9.73提升至14.09（+45%），EasyOcc达到13.86 mIoU，在全场景评估中达到7.71 mIoU，超越之前最佳模型31%。

Conclusion: 基础模型、时序上下文和损失计算空间选择对自监督学习的全面场景理解至关重要，提出的方法具有高效性和可迁移性。

Abstract: Self-supervised models have recently achieved notable advancements,
particularly in the domain of semantic occupancy prediction. These models
utilize sophisticated loss computation strategies to compensate for the absence
of ground-truth labels. For instance, techniques such as novel view synthesis,
cross-view rendering, and depth estimation have been explored to address the
issue of semantic and depth ambiguity. However, such techniques typically incur
high computational costs and memory usage during the training stage, especially
in the case of novel view synthesis. To mitigate these issues, we propose 3D
pseudo-ground-truth labels generated by the foundation models Grounded-SAM and
Metric3Dv2, and harness temporal information for label densification. Our 3D
pseudo-labels can be easily integrated into existing models, which yields
substantial performance improvements, with mIoU increasing by 45\%, from 9.73
to 14.09, when implemented into the OccNeRF model. This stands in contrast to
earlier advancements in the field, which are often not readily transferable to
other architectures. Additionally, we propose a streamlined model, EasyOcc,
achieving 13.86 mIoU. This model conducts learning solely from our labels,
avoiding complex rendering strategies mentioned previously. Furthermore, our
method enables models to attain state-of-the-art performance when evaluated on
the full scene without applying the camera mask, with EasyOcc achieving 7.71
mIoU, outperforming the previous best model by 31\%. These findings highlight
the critical importance of foundation models, temporal context, and the choice
of loss computation space in self-supervised learning for comprehensive scene
understanding.

Motivation: 点球经常决定冠军归属，但守门员必须在极短时间内从细微的生物力学线索中预判踢球者意图。

Method: 采用双分支架构：MobileNetV2 CNN提取RGB帧空间特征，2D关键点通过带注意力机制的LSTM网络处理。基于距离的阈值方法在球接触前分割输入序列。

Result: 在755个点球事件数据集上测试，准确率89%，比纯视觉和纯姿态基线提升14-22%。

Conclusion: 轻量级可解释设计适用于守门员训练、战术分析和实时比赛分析。

Abstract: Penalty kicks often decide championships, yet goalkeepers must anticipate the
kicker's intent from subtle biomechanical cues within a very short time window.
This study introduces a real-time, multi-modal deep learning framework to
predict the direction of a penalty kick (left, middle, or right) before ball
contact. The model uses a dual-branch architecture: a MobileNetV2-based CNN
extracts spatial features from RGB frames, while 2D keypoints are processed by
an LSTM network with attention mechanisms. Pose-derived keypoints further guide
visual focus toward task-relevant regions. A distance-based thresholding method
segments input sequences immediately before ball contact, ensuring consistent
input across diverse footage. A custom dataset of 755 penalty kick events was
created from real match videos, with frame-level annotations for object
detection, shooter keypoints, and final ball placement. The model achieved 89%
accuracy on a held-out test set, outperforming visual-only and pose-only
baselines by 14-22%. With an inference time of 22 milliseconds, the lightweight
and interpretable design makes it suitable for goalkeeper training, tactical
analysis, and real-time game analytics.

Conclusion: 该工作不仅推动了文本到场景生成领域，还展示了现代大型推理模型的高级空间推理能力，并发布了代码库以促进相关研究。

Abstract: Prompt-driven scene synthesis allows users to generate complete 3D
environments from textual descriptions. Current text-to-scene methods often
struggle with complex geometries and object transformations, and tend to show
weak adherence to complex instructions. We address these limitations by
introducing Reason-3D, a text-to-scene model powered by large reasoning models
(LRMs). Reason-3D integrates object retrieval using captions covering physical,
functional, and contextual attributes. Reason-3D then places the selected
objects based on implicit and explicit layout constraints, and refines their
positions with collision-aware spatial reasoning. Evaluated on instructions
ranging from simple to complex indoor configurations, Reason-3D significantly
outperforms previous methods in human-rated visual fidelity, adherence to
constraints, and asset retrieval quality. Beyond its contribution to the field
of text-to-scene generation, our work showcases the advanced spatial reasoning
abilities of modern LRMs. Additionally, we release the codebase to further the
research in object retrieval and placement with LRMs.

Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成方面表现出色，但存在推理速度慢和训练-推理不一致的问题。现有梯度求解器缺乏信息传输效率的理论基础

Method: 从信息论角度分析扩散模型推理过程，提出熵感知方差优化方法(EVODiff)，通过优化条件熵来系统性地减少去噪过程中的不确定性

Result: 在CIFAR-10上，EVODiff在10次函数评估时将重构误差降低45.5%(FID从5.10提升到2.78)；在ImageNet-256上，将高质量样本的NFE成本减少25%(从20降到15)；同时改善文本到图像生成并减少伪影

Conclusion: EVODiff方法通过信息论视角优化扩散模型推理，在生成质量和效率方面显著优于现有最先进的梯度求解器，为扩散模型推理提供了新的理论基础和实用方法

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) excel in image generation, but suffer from slow
inference and the training-inference discrepancies. Although gradient-based
solvers like DPM-Solver accelerate the denoising inference, they lack
theoretical foundations in information transmission efficiency. In this work,
we introduce an information-theoretic perspective on the inference processes of
DMs, revealing that successful denoising fundamentally reduces conditional
entropy in reverse transitions. This principle leads to our key insights into
the inference processes: (1) data prediction parameterization outperforms its
noise counterpart, and (2) optimizing conditional variance offers a
reference-free way to minimize both transition and reconstruction errors. Based
on these insights, we propose an entropy-aware variance optimized method for
the generative process of DMs, called EVODiff, which systematically reduces
uncertainty by optimizing conditional entropy during denoising. Extensive
experiments on DMs validate our insights and demonstrate that our method
significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)
gradient-based solvers. For example, compared to the DPM-Solver++, EVODiff
reduces the reconstruction error by up to 45.5\% (FID improves from 5.10 to
2.78) at 10 function evaluations (NFE) on CIFAR-10, cuts the NFE cost by 25\%
(from 20 to 15 NFE) for high-quality samples on ImageNet-256, and improves
text-to-image generation while reducing artifacts. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoGen是一个基于视觉自回归模型(VAR)的主题驱动生成框架，通过双路径注入策略实现高效、高质量的主题驱动图像生成，解决了现有方法在效率和零样本能力之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主题驱动生成方法存在明显权衡：要么依赖计算昂贵的逐主题微调，牺牲效率和零样本能力；要么使用基于扩散模型的前馈架构，但推理速度缓慢。VAR模型以其快速采样速度和强大生成质量成为理想但未被充分探索的基础。

Method: 提出EchoGen框架，采用双路径注入策略：使用语义编码器提取主题的抽象身份，通过解耦交叉注意力注入以指导整体构图；同时使用内容编码器捕捉精细视觉细节，通过多模态注意力机制集成以确保高保真纹理和结构保留。

Result: 定量和定性结果验证了设计有效性，EchoGen在主题保真度和图像质量上可与最先进的基于扩散的方法相媲美，同时显著降低了采样延迟。

Conclusion: EchoGen是首个基于VAR模型的前馈主题驱动框架，成功解决了主题驱动生成中效率与质量之间的权衡问题，为高效、高质量的创意AI生成提供了新方向。

Abstract: Subject-driven generation is a critical task in creative AI; yet current
state-of-the-art methods present a stark trade-off. They either rely on
computationally expensive, per-subject fine-tuning, sacrificing efficiency and
zero-shot capability, or employ feed-forward architectures built on diffusion
models, which are inherently plagued by slow inference speeds. Visual
Auto-Regressive (VAR) models are renowned for their rapid sampling speeds and
strong generative quality, making them an ideal yet underexplored foundation
for resolving this tension. To bridge this gap, we introduce EchoGen, a
pioneering framework that empowers VAR models with subject-driven generation
capabilities. The core design of EchoGen is an effective dual-path injection
strategy that disentangles a subject's high-level semantic identity from its
low-level fine-grained details, enabling enhanced controllability and fidelity.
We employ a semantic encoder to extract the subject's abstract identity, which
is injected through decoupled cross-attention to guide the overall composition.
Concurrently, a content encoder captures intricate visual details, which are
integrated via a multi-modal attention mechanism to ensure high-fidelity
texture and structural preservation. To the best of our knowledge, EchoGen is
the first feed-forward subject-driven framework built upon VAR models. Both
quantitative and qualitative results substantiate our design, demonstrating
that EchoGen achieves subject fidelity and image quality comparable to
state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods with significantly lower sampling
latency. Code and models will be released soon.

TL;DR: 提出EntroPE（熵引导动态补丁编码器），通过条件熵动态检测时间序列中的过渡点来动态放置补丁边界，解决了传统固定补丁方法破坏时间连贯性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于补丁的时间序列预测方法使用时间无关的补丁构建策略，任意起始位置和固定长度会破坏自然的时间过渡，分裂短期依赖关系并削弱表示学习。

Method: EntroPE包含两个关键模块：基于熵的动态补丁器（EDP）使用信息论标准定位自然时间变化点并确定补丁边界；自适应补丁编码器（APE）使用池化和交叉注意力捕获补丁内依赖关系并生成固定大小的潜在表示。

Result: 在长期预测基准测试中，EntroPE在准确性和效率方面都有所提升。

Conclusion: 熵引导的动态补丁方法为时间序列建模提供了一个有前景的新范式。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have significantly advanced time series forecasting,
with patch-based input strategies offering efficiency and improved long-horizon
modeling. Yet, existing approaches rely on temporally-agnostic patch
construction, where arbitrary starting positions and fixed lengths fracture
temporal coherence by splitting natural transitions across boundaries. This
naive segmentation often disrupts short-term dependencies and weakens
representation learning. In response, we propose EntroPE (Entropy-Guided
Dynamic Patch Encoder), a novel, temporally informed framework that dynamically
detects transition points via conditional entropy and dynamically places patch
boundaries. This preserves temporal structure while retaining the computational
benefits of patching. EntroPE consists of two key modules, namely an
Entropy-based Dynamic Patcher (EDP) that applies information-theoretic criteria
to locate natural temporal shifts and determine patch boundaries, and an
Adaptive Patch Encoder (APE) that employs pooling and cross-attention to
capture intra-patch dependencies and produce fixed-size latent representations.
These embeddings are then processed by a global transformer to model
inter-patch dynamics. Experiments across long-term forecasting benchmarks
demonstrate that EntroPE improves both accuracy and efficiency, establishing
entropy-guided dynamic patching as a promising new paradigm for time series
modeling. Code is available at: https://github.com/Sachithx/EntroPE.

Abstract: The performance of deep neural networks is strongly influenced by the quality
of their training data. However, mitigating dataset bias by manually curating
challenging edge cases remains a major bottleneck. To address this, we propose
an automated pipeline for text-guided edge-case synthesis. Our approach employs
a Large Language Model, fine-tuned via preference learning, to rephrase image
captions into diverse textual prompts that steer a Text-to-Image model toward
generating difficult visual scenarios. Evaluated on the FishEye8K object
detection benchmark, our method achieves superior robustness, surpassing both
naive augmentation and manually engineered prompts. This work establishes a
scalable framework that shifts data curation from manual effort to automated,
targeted synthesis, offering a promising direction for developing more reliable

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
advances in visual understanding tasks. However, their capacity to comprehend
human-centric scenes has rarely been explored, primarily due to the absence of
comprehensive evaluation benchmarks that take into account both the
human-oriented granular level and higher-dimensional causal reasoning ability.
Such high-quality evaluation benchmarks face tough obstacles, given the
physical complexity of the human body and the difficulty of annotating granular
structures. In this paper, we propose Human-MME, a curated benchmark designed
to provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric scene
understanding. Compared with other existing benchmarks, our work provides three
key features: 1. Diversity in human scene, spanning 4 primary visual domains
with 15 secondary domains and 43 sub-fields to ensure broad scenario coverage.
2. Progressive and diverse evaluation dimensions, evaluating the human-based
activities progressively from the human-oriented granular perception to the
higher-dimensional reasoning, consisting of eight dimensions with 19,945
real-world image question pairs and an evaluation suite. 3. High-quality
annotations with rich data paradigms, constructing the automated annotation
pipeline and human-annotation platform, supporting rigorous manual labeling to
facilitate precise and reliable model assessment. Our benchmark extends the
single-target understanding to the multi-person and multi-image mutual
understanding by constructing the choice, short-answer, grounding, ranking and
judgment question components, and complex questions of their combination. The
extensive experiments on 17 state-of-the-art MLLMs effectively expose the
limitations and guide future MLLMs research toward better human-centric image
understanding. All data and code are available at

### [91] [Beyond Overall Accuracy: Pose- and Occlusion-driven Fairness Analysis in Pedestrian Detection for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26166)
*Mohammad Khoshkdahan,Arman Akbari,Arash Akbari,Xuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文首次对自动驾驶中的行人检测进行了全面的姿态和遮挡感知公平性评估，发现检测器对平行腿、直肘和侧向视角的行人存在偏见，且下半身关节遮挡对检测率的影响更大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然许多检测模型旨在降低漏检率并处理遮挡和远距离识别等挑战，但公平性仍然是一个未被充分探索但同样重要的问题。本文系统研究行人姿态变化（包括腿部状态、肘部状态和身体方向）以及个体关节遮挡如何影响检测性能。

Method: 在ECP-DP数据集上评估五个行人专用检测器（F2DNet、MGAN、ALFNet、CSP和Cascade R-CNN）和三个通用模型（YOLOv12变体），使用EOD指标量化公平性，并应用Z检验评估统计显著性和鲁棒性。

Result: 发现检测器对平行腿、直肘和侧向视角的行人存在偏见。下半身关节遮挡对检测率的负面影响比上半身和头部更大。Cascade R-CNN实现了最低的总体漏检率，并在所有属性中表现出最小的偏见。

Conclusion: 这是自动驾驶行人检测中首次全面的姿态和遮挡感知公平性评估，揭示了现有检测器在公平性方面的重要局限性，并强调了在开发行人检测系统时考虑姿态和遮挡公平性的必要性。

Abstract: Pedestrian detection plays a critical role in autonomous driving (AD), where
ensuring safety and reliability is important. While many detection models aim
to reduce miss-rates and handle challenges such as occlusion and long-range
recognition, fairness remains an underexplored yet equally important concern.
In this work, we systematically investigate how variations in the pedestrian
pose -- including leg status, elbow status, and body orientation -- as well as
individual joint occlusions, affect detection performance. We evaluate five
pedestrian-specific detectors (F2DNet, MGAN, ALFNet, CSP, and Cascade R-CNN)
alongside three general-purpose models (YOLOv12 variants) on the EuroCity
Persons Dense Pose (ECP-DP) dataset. Fairness is quantified using the Equal
Opportunity Difference (EOD) metric across various confidence thresholds. To
assess statistical significance and robustness, we apply the Z-test. Our
findings highlight biases against pedestrians with parallel legs, straight
elbows, and lateral views. Occlusion of lower body joints has a more negative
impact on the detection rate compared to the upper body and head. Cascade R-CNN
achieves the lowest overall miss-rate and exhibits the smallest bias across all
attributes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive pose-
and occlusion-aware fairness evaluation in pedestrian detection for AD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AttriGen是一个用于计算机视觉中自动化、细粒度多属性标注的新框架，特别针对细胞显微镜图像，通过双模型架构实现细胞类型分类和多属性分类，达到94.62%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在细胞显微镜领域，多属性分类相比传统的细胞类型分类研究较少，需要开发自动化方法来提高标注效率和模型可解释性。

Method: 使用双模型架构：CNN用于细胞类型分类，Vision Transformer用于多属性分类，基于PBC数据集（8种细胞类型）和WBCAtt数据集（11种形态属性）。

Result: 在多属性分类中达到94.62%的准确率，显著提高模型可解释性，相比传统人工标注节省大量时间和成本。

Conclusion: AttriGen建立了一个可扩展到其他计算机视觉分类任务的新范式，有效自动化多属性标签的扩展。

Abstract: We introduce AttriGen, a novel framework for automated, fine-grained
multi-attribute annotation in computer vision, with a particular focus on cell
microscopy where multi-attribute classification remains underrepresented
compared to traditional cell type categorization. Using two complementary
datasets: the Peripheral Blood Cell (PBC) dataset containing eight distinct
cell types and the WBC Attribute Dataset (WBCAtt) that contains their
corresponding 11 morphological attributes, we propose a dual-model architecture
that combines a CNN for cell type classification, as well as a Vision
Transformer (ViT) for multi-attribute classification achieving a new benchmark
of 94.62\% accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that AttriGen significantly
enhances model interpretability and offers substantial time and cost efficiency
relative to conventional full-scale human annotation. Thus, our framework
establishes a new paradigm that can be extended to other computer vision
classification tasks by effectively automating the expansion of multi-attribute
labels.

Conclusion: TSalV360方法在360度视频中成功实现了文本驱动的显著性检测，为个性化视频分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we deal with the task of text-driven saliency detection in
360-degrees videos. For this, we introduce the TSV360 dataset which includes
16,000 triplets of ERP frames, textual descriptions of salient objects/events
in these frames, and the associated ground-truth saliency maps. Following, we
extend and adapt a SOTA visual-based approach for 360-degrees video saliency
detection, and develop the TSalV360 method that takes into account a
user-provided text description of the desired objects and/or events. This
method leverages a SOTA vision-language model for data representation and
integrates a similarity estimation module and a viewport spatio-temporal
cross-attention mechanism, to discover dependencies between the different data
modalities. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations using the TSV360 dataset,
showed the competitiveness of TSalV360 compared to a SOTA visual-based approach
and documented its competency to perform customized text-driven saliency
detection in 360-degrees videos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GSDD方法，使用2D高斯函数的稀疏表示进行数据集蒸馏，仅用少量高斯基元编码关键判别信息，相比传统密集像素方法更高效且可扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据集蒸馏方法依赖密集像素级表示，存在冗余且难以扩展，需要更高效的稀疏表示来降低计算和存储负担。

Method: 基于2D高斯函数的稀疏表示，使用CUDA-based splatting算子进行并行推理和训练，实现高质量渲染且计算内存开销小。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet子集上达到最先进性能，同时保持高效的编码解码成本。

Conclusion: GSDD是一种简单有效、广泛适用且高度可扩展的数据集蒸馏方法，通过稀疏表示显著提升性能与效率。

Abstract: Dataset distillation has emerged as a promising paradigm that synthesizes
compact, informative datasets capable of retaining the knowledge of large-scale
counterparts, thereby addressing the substantial computational and storage
burdens of modern model training. Conventional approaches typically rely on
dense pixel-level representations, which introduce redundancy and are difficult
to scale up. In this work, we propose GSDD, a novel and efficient sparse
representation for dataset distillation based on 2D Gaussians. Instead of
representing all pixels equally, GSDD encodes critical discriminative
information in a distilled image using only a small number of Gaussian
primitives. This sparse representation could improve dataset diversity under
the same storage budget, enhancing coverage of difficult samples and boosting
distillation performance. To ensure both efficiency and scalability, we adapt
CUDA-based splatting operators for parallel inference and training, enabling
high-quality rendering with minimal computational and memory overhead. Our
method is simple yet effective, broadly applicable to different distillation
pipelines, and highly scalable. Experiments show that GSDD achieves
state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet subsets,
while remaining highly efficient encoding and decoding cost. Our code is

Motivation: 研究可解释AI中最受关注的特征之一——解释的可信度，即解释与人类推理和期望的一致性。

Method: 扩展现有的多粒度视频摘要解释框架，集成LLaVA-OneVision模型生成文本描述，使用SBERT和SimCSE两种句子嵌入方法来量化视觉解释与视频摘要文本描述之间的语义重叠。

Result: 使用CA-SUM方法和SumMe、TVSum两个数据集进行实验研究，检验更忠实的解释是否也是更可信的解释。

Conclusion: 确定了生成可信视频摘要文本解释的最合适方法，并验证了忠实性与可信度之间的关系。

Abstract: In this paper, we present our experimental study on generating plausible
textual explanations for the outcomes of video summarization. For the needs of
this study, we extend an existing framework for multigranular explanation of
video summarization by integrating a SOTA Large Multimodal Model
(LLaVA-OneVision) and prompting it to produce natural language descriptions of
the obtained visual explanations. Following, we focus on one of the most
desired characteristics for explainable AI, the plausibility of the obtained
explanations that relates with their alignment with the humans' reasoning and
expectations. Using the extended framework, we propose an approach for
evaluating the plausibility of visual explanations by quantifying the semantic
overlap between their textual descriptions and the textual descriptions of the
corresponding video summaries, with the help of two methods for creating
sentence embeddings (SBERT, SimCSE). Based on the extended framework and the
proposed plausibility evaluation approach, we conduct an experimental study
using a SOTA method (CA-SUM) and two datasets (SumMe, TVSum) for video
summarization, to examine whether the more faithful explanations are also the
more plausible ones, and identify the most appropriate approach for generating
plausible textual explanations for video summarization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MGCE框架解决广义类别发现问题，通过多粒度概念专家自适应挖掘视觉概念，无需预知未标记类别数量，在九个细粒度视觉识别基准上取得SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在两个主要局限：1) 未能充分利用视觉数据中的多粒度概念信息；2) 大多假设训练时已知未标记类别数量，这在现实场景中不切实际。

Method: MGCE包含两个模块：动态概念对比学习(DCCL)交替进行概念挖掘和双级表示学习；多粒度专家协作学习(MECL)引入不同粒度的额外专家，使用概念对齐矩阵实现跨专家协作。

Result: 在九个细粒度视觉识别基准上实现最先进结果，特别是在新类别准确率方面。即使没有类别数量先验知识，MGCE也优于需要知道确切类别数量的参数化方法，平均提升3.6%。

Conclusion: MGCE能够自动估计未标记数据中的类别数量，适用于实际的开放世界设置，为广义类别发现提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is an open-world problem that clusters
unlabeled data by leveraging knowledge from partially labeled categories. A key
challenge is that unlabeled data may contain both known and novel categories.
Existing approaches suffer from two main limitations. First, they fail to
exploit multi-granularity conceptual information in visual data, which limits
representation quality. Second, most assume that the number of unlabeled
categories is known during training, which is impractical in real-world
scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Granularity Conceptual
Experts (MGCE) framework that adaptively mines visual concepts and integrates
multi-granularity knowledge for accurate category discovery. MGCE consists of
two modules: (1) Dynamic Conceptual Contrastive Learning (DCCL), which
alternates between concept mining and dual-level representation learning to
jointly optimize feature learning and category discovery; and (2)
Multi-Granularity Experts Collaborative Learning (MECL), which extends the
single-expert paradigm by introducing additional experts at different
granularities and by employing a concept alignment matrix for effective
cross-expert collaboration. Importantly, MGCE can automatically estimate the
number of categories in unlabeled data, making it suitable for practical
open-world settings. Extensive experiments on nine fine-grained visual
recognition benchmarks demonstrate that MGCE achieves state-of-the-art results,
particularly in novel-class accuracy. Notably, even without prior knowledge of
category numbers, MGCE outperforms parametric approaches that require knowing
the exact number of categories, with an average improvement of 3.6\%. Code is
available at https://github.com/HaiyangZheng/MGCE.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IMG是一个无需额外数据或编辑操作的多模态对齐框架，通过MLLM识别错位、隐式对齐器操作扩散条件特征、以及迭代更新偏好目标来实现图像与提示的精确对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散生成图像与输入提示之间的多模态对齐问题，现有方法要么依赖有限的高质量偏好数据，要么通过编辑局部区域可能损害整体图像质量。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型识别错位，引入隐式对齐器操作扩散条件特征以减少错位并实现重新生成，将重新对齐目标制定为可训练的迭代更新偏好目标。

Result: 在SDXL、SDXL-DPO和FLUX上的广泛定性和定量评估表明，IMG优于现有的对齐方法，并能作为灵活的即插即用适配器增强先前的基于微调的对齐方法。

Conclusion: IMG提供了一个有效且无需额外数据的多模态对齐解决方案，能够显著提升扩散模型生成图像与输入提示的对齐精度。

Abstract: Ensuring precise multimodal alignment between diffusion-generated images and
input prompts has been a long-standing challenge. Earlier works finetune
diffusion weight using high-quality preference data, which tends to be limited
and difficult to scale up. Recent editing-based methods further refine local
regions of generated images but may compromise overall image quality. In this
work, we propose Implicit Multimodal Guidance (IMG), a novel
re-generation-based multimodal alignment framework that requires no extra data
or editing operations. Specifically, given a generated image and its prompt,
IMG a) utilizes a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to identify
misalignments; b) introduces an Implicit Aligner that manipulates diffusion
conditioning features to reduce misalignments and enable re-generation; and c)
formulates the re-alignment goal into a trainable objective, namely Iteratively
Updated Preference Objective. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
evaluations on SDXL, SDXL-DPO, and FLUX show that IMG outperforms existing
alignment methods. Furthermore, IMG acts as a flexible plug-and-play adapter,
seamlessly enhancing prior finetuning-based alignment methods. Our code will be
available at https://github.com/SHI-Labs/IMG-Multimodal-Diffusion-Alignment.

Result: 开发出Donut-MINT，在DocVQA基准测试上保持强性能的同时，显著减少了推理时间和内存使用。

Conclusion: 该方法将压缩重新定义为电路发现，连接了可解释性研究和实际视觉语言模型部署。

Abstract: Recent advances in Visually-rich Document Understanding rely on large
Vision-Language Models like Donut, which perform document-level Visual Question
Answering without Optical Character Recognition. Despite their effectiveness,
these models are too costly for real-time or resource-constrained applications.
We investigate model compression through knowledge distillation, training
compact student models from a larger teacher. We leverage mechanistic
interpretability to drive student architecture design within this framework. By
analyzing internal computations, we identify essential subcomponents to retain,
while having a clear view of which subcomponents should be approximated,
skipped, or reparametrized based on their function. This approach yields
Donut-MINT (Mechanistic Interpretability-based Network Trimming), a pruned
Donut variant that reduces inference time and memory usage while maintaining
strong performance on DocVQA, a standard benchmark for document Visual Question
Answering. Our method reframes compression as circuit discovery, bridging
interpretability research and practical Vision-Language Model deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有潜在动作模型存在两个瓶颈：端到端训练的图像编码器空间理解能力差，以及输入帧距离较远时模型脆弱导致时间感知有限，这阻碍了稳定清晰的动作建模。

Method: 提出Farsighted-LAM框架，包含几何感知空间编码和多尺度时间建模，从连续帧中捕捉结构先验和动态运动模式。进一步构建SSM-VLA端到端框架，集成结构化感知和视觉思维链模块来显式推理环境动态。

Result: 在仿真和真实世界的多个VLA任务上验证了SSM-VLA，实现了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: 结合几何感知建模、时间一致性和显式推理的策略能有效增强具身智能的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Latent Action Models (LAMs) enable Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems to
learn semantic action representations from large-scale unannotated data. Yet,
we identify two bottlenecks of LAMs: 1) the commonly adopted end-to-end trained
image encoder suffers from poor spatial understanding; 2) LAMs can be fragile
when input frames are distant, leading to limited temporal perception. Such
factors inevitably hinder stable and clear action modeling. To this end, we
propose Farsighted-LAM, a latent action framework with geometry-aware spatial
encoding and multi-scale temporal modeling, capturing structural priors and
dynamic motion patterns from consecutive frames. We further propose SSM-VLA, an
end-to-end VLA framework built upon Farsighted-LAM, which integrates structured
perception with a visual Chain-of-Thought module to explicitly reason about
environmental dynamics, enhancing decision consistency and interpretability. We
validate SSM-VLA on multiple VLA tasks in both simulation and real-world
settings, and achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our results demonstrate
that our strategy of combining geometry-aware modeling, temporal coherence, and
explicit reasoning is effective in enhancing the robustness and
generalizability of embodied intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成媒体的快速发展使深度伪造检测成为关键挑战，但现有数据集稀缺且多模态大语言模型在检测中表现不佳，常产生与视觉证据不符的幻觉解释。

Method: 引入带推理标注的深度伪造检测数据集，并提出段落级相对策略优化(PRPO)强化学习算法，在段落级别对齐LLM推理与图像内容。

Result: PRPO大幅提升检测准确率，获得4.55/5.0的最高推理分数，消融研究显示在测试条件下显著优于GRPO。

Conclusion: 将多模态推理基于视觉证据对于实现更可靠和可解释的深度伪造检测至关重要。

Abstract: The rapid rise of synthetic media has made deepfake detection a critical
challenge for online safety and trust. Progress remains constrained by the
scarcity of large, high-quality datasets. Although multimodal large language
models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities, their performance on
deepfake detection is poor, often producing explanations that are misaligned
with visual evidence or hallucinatory. To address this limitation, we introduce
a reasoning-annotated dataset for deepfake detection and propose
Paragraph-level Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO), a reinforcement learning
algorithm that aligns LLM reasoning with image content at the paragraph level.
Experiments show that PRPO improves detection accuracy by a wide margin and
achieves the highest reasoning score of 4.55/5.0. Ablation studies further
demonstrate that PRPO significantly outperforms GRPO under test-time
conditions. These results underscore the importance of grounding multimodal
reasoning in visual evidence to enable more reliable and interpretable deepfake
detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于聚类的仿射变换（CAT）方法，用于改善低比特后训练量化（PTQ）的精度问题，通过聚类特定参数来对齐量化输出与全精度输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的仿射变换在低比特PTQ中会恶化结果，因为对所有输出使用统一的仿射参数集无法有效减少量化误差。

Method: 提出CAT框架，使用聚类特定的参数来精炼低比特量化输出，仅需少量额外参数，无需微调模型或量化参数。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上的实验表明，该方法在多种架构和低比特设置下均优于现有PTQ方法，W2A2 ResNet-18上达到53.18%的Top-1准确率，作为插件可提升现有基线3%以上。

Conclusion: CAT是一种有效的误差减少框架，能够显著改善低比特PTQ的性能，且具有轻量级和即插即用的优势。

Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) reduces the memory footprint and
computational overhead of deep neural networks by converting full-precision
(FP) values into quantized and compressed data types. While PTQ is more
cost-efficient than Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), it is highly susceptible
to accuracy degradation under a low-bit quantization (LQ) regime (e.g., 2-bit).
Affine transformation is a classical technique used to reduce the discrepancy
between the information processed by a quantized model and that processed by
its full-precision counterpart; however, we find that using plain affine
transformation, which applies a uniform affine parameter set for all outputs,
worsens the results in low-bit PTQ. To address this, we propose Cluster-based
Affine Transformation (CAT), an error-reduction framework that employs
cluster-specific parameters to align LQ outputs with FP counterparts. CAT
refines LQ outputs with only a negligible number of additional parameters,
without requiring fine-tuning of the model or quantization parameters. We
further introduce a novel PTQ framework integrated with CAT. Experiments on
ImageNet-1K show that this framework consistently outperforms prior PTQ methods
across diverse architectures and LQ settings, achieving up to 53.18% Top-1
accuracy on W2A2 ResNet-18. Moreover, CAT enhances existing PTQ baselines by
more than 3% when used as a plug-in. We plan to release our implementation
alongside the publication of this paper.

Abstract: Existing approaches to skill proficiency estimation often rely on black-box
video classifiers, ignoring multi-view context and lacking explainability. We
present ProfVLM, a compact vision-language model that reformulates this task as
generative reasoning: it jointly predicts skill level and generates expert-like
feedback from egocentric and exocentric videos. Central to our method is an
AttentiveGatedProjector that dynamically fuses multi-view features, projected
from a frozen TimeSformer backbone into a language model tuned for feedback
generation. Trained on EgoExo4D with expert commentaries, ProfVLM surpasses
state-of-the-art methods while using up to 20x fewer parameters and reducing
training time by up to 60%. Our approach not only achieves superior accuracy
across diverse activities, but also outputs natural language critiques aligned
with performance, offering transparent reasoning. These results highlight
generative vision-language modeling as a powerful new direction for skill
assessment.

Result: 在多个数据集上取得优异性能：DOTA-v1.0(66.09%)、DOTA-v1.5(56.86%)、DOTA-v2.0(41.28%)、DIOR(46.40%)、STAR(19.60%)、RSAR(45.96%)，特别在目标尺寸变化大或稀疏场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: Point2RBox-v3是首个使用动态伪标签进行标签分配的模型，创新性地结合了SAM模型和分水岭算法，在稀疏和密集场景中都能达到优秀性能。

Abstract: Driven by the growing need for Oriented Object Detection (OOD), learning from
point annotations under a weakly-supervised framework has emerged as a
promising alternative to costly and laborious manual labeling. In this paper,
we discuss two deficiencies in existing point-supervised methods: inefficient
utilization and poor quality of pseudo labels. Therefore, we present
Point2RBox-v3. At the core are two principles: 1) Progressive Label Assignment
(PLA). It dynamically estimates instance sizes in a coarse yet intelligent
manner at different stages of the training process, enabling the use of label
assignment methods. 2) Prior-Guided Dynamic Mask Loss (PGDM-Loss). It is an
enhancement of the Voronoi Watershed Loss from Point2RBox-v2, which overcomes
the shortcomings of Watershed in its poor performance in sparse scenes and
SAM's poor performance in dense scenes. To our knowledge, Point2RBox-v3 is the
first model to employ dynamic pseudo labels for label assignment, and it
creatively complements the advantages of SAM model with the watershed
algorithm, which achieves excellent performance in both sparse and dense
scenes. Our solution gives competitive performance, especially in scenarios
with large variations in object size or sparse object occurrences:
66.09%/56.86%/41.28%/46.40%/19.60%/45.96% on
DOTA-v1.0/DOTA-v1.5/DOTA-v2.0/DIOR/STAR/RSAR.

*Mehrsa Pourya,Bassam El Rawas,Michael Unser*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flower是一个用于逆问题的求解器，利用预训练的流模型生成与观测测量一致的解。通过三步迭代过程实现：流一致目标估计、可行集投影和时间推进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一即插即用方法和生成式逆问题求解器的视角，提供近似贝叶斯后验采样的理论保证。

Method: 三步迭代过程：1) 流一致目标估计（速度网络预测去噪目标）；2) 精炼步骤（将估计目标投影到前向算子定义的可行集）；3) 时间推进步骤（沿流轨迹重新投影精炼目标）。

Result: 在各种逆问题上实现了最先进的重建质量，且使用几乎相同的超参数。

Conclusion: Flower通过流模型统一了不同逆问题求解方法，在保持理论保证的同时实现了优异的实际性能。

Abstract: We introduce Flower, a solver for inverse problems. It leverages a
pre-trained flow model to produce reconstructions that are consistent with the
observed measurements. Flower operates through an iterative procedure over
three steps: (i) a flow-consistent destination estimation, where the velocity
network predicts a denoised target; (ii) a refinement step that projects the
estimated destination onto a feasible set defined by the forward operator; and
(iii) a time-progression step that re-projects the refined destination along
the flow trajectory. We provide a theoretical analysis that demonstrates how
Flower approximates Bayesian posterior sampling, thereby unifying perspectives
from plug-and-play methods and generative inverse solvers. On the practical
side, Flower achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality while using
nearly identical hyperparameters across various inverse problems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种连续时空视频超分辨率的新方法，使用3D视频傅里叶场表示视频，能够同时捕获空间细节和时间动态，实现任意时空位置的灵活采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将视频解耦为空间和时间分量，依赖脆弱的显式帧扭曲进行运动补偿，存在局限性。需要一种更统一、连续的视频表示方法。

Method: 将视频编码为连续的、时空一致的3D视频傅里叶场，使用神经网络预测傅里叶基系数，包含高斯点扩散函数确保无混叠重建。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到新的最先进水平，在广泛的放大因子范围内提供更清晰、时间更一致的重建结果，计算效率更高。

Conclusion: 联合建模方法显著改善了空间和时间超分辨率性能，证明了连续傅里叶场表示在视频超分辨率任务中的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce a novel formulation for continuous space-time video
super-resolution. Instead of decoupling the representation of a video sequence
into separate spatial and temporal components and relying on brittle, explicit
frame warping for motion compensation, we encode video as a continuous,
spatio-temporally coherent 3D Video Fourier Field (VFF). That representation
offers three key advantages: (1) it enables cheap, flexible sampling at
arbitrary locations in space and time; (2) it is able to simultaneously capture
fine spatial detail and smooth temporal dynamics; and (3) it offers the
possibility to include an analytical, Gaussian point spread function in the
sampling to ensure aliasing-free reconstruction at arbitrary scale. The
coefficients of the proposed, Fourier-like sinusoidal basis are predicted with
a neural encoder with a large spatio-temporal receptive field, conditioned on
the low-resolution input video. Through extensive experiments, we show that our
joint modeling substantially improves both spatial and temporal
super-resolution and sets a new state of the art for multiple benchmarks:
across a wide range of upscaling factors, it delivers sharper and temporally
more consistent reconstructions than existing baselines, while being
computationally more efficient. Project page: https://v3vsr.github.io.

*Ren-Di Wu,Yu-Yen Lin,Huei-Fang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SQUARE是一个无需训练的两阶段零样本组合图像检索框架，利用多模态大语言模型增强检索性能，通过语义查询增强融合和高效批量重排来更准确地捕捉用户意图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零样本组合图像检索方法虽然无需特定任务训练或标注数据，但准确捕捉用户意图仍然具有挑战性。现有方法在理解用户指定的文本修改方面存在不足。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1）语义查询增强融合阶段，使用MLLM生成目标图像描述来丰富CLIP等VLM的查询嵌入；2）高效批量重排阶段，将候选图像以网格形式呈现给MLLM进行联合视觉语义推理。

Result: 在四个标准CIR基准测试中表现出色，即使使用轻量级预训练模型也能保持高性能，证明了其潜在适用性。

Conclusion: SQUARE框架简单有效，通过结合MLLM的语义理解能力显著提升了零样本组合图像检索的性能，能够更准确地捕捉用户意图。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve target images that preserve
the visual content of a reference image while incorporating user-specified
textual modifications. Training-free zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR) approaches, which
require no task-specific training or labeled data, are highly desirable, yet
accurately capturing user intent remains challenging. In this paper, we present
SQUARE, a novel two-stage training-free framework that leverages Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enhance ZS-CIR. In the Semantic
Query-Augmented Fusion (SQAF) stage, we enrich the query embedding derived from
a vision-language model (VLM) such as CLIP with MLLM-generated captions of the
target image. These captions provide high-level semantic guidance, enabling the
query to better capture the user's intent and improve global retrieval quality.
In the Efficient Batch Reranking (EBR) stage, top-ranked candidates are
presented as an image grid with visual marks to the MLLM, which performs joint
visual-semantic reasoning across all candidates. Our reranking strategy
operates in a single pass and yields more accurate rankings. Experiments show
that SQUARE, with its simplicity and effectiveness, delivers strong performance
on four standard CIR benchmarks. Notably, it maintains high performance even
with lightweight pre-trained, demonstrating its potential applicability.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个名为\mname的奖励模型，用于解决开源图像编辑模型中缺乏可靠奖励模型的问题。该模型基于包含20万对偏好数据的大规模人工标注数据集训练，在多个基准测试中表现优异，并能有效筛选高质量训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图像编辑领域存在开源模型落后于闭源模型的问题，主要瓶颈是缺乏可靠的奖励模型来扩展高质量合成训练数据。

Method: 构建了包含20万对偏好数据的大规模人工标注数据集，训练\mname奖励模型，并使用该模型从现有噪声数据集中筛选高质量子集。

Result: \mname在GenAI-Bench、AURORA-Bench、ImagenHub等多个基准测试中实现了最先进的人类相关性，使用其筛选的数据训练Step1X-Edit模型相比完整数据集有显著提升。

Conclusion: \mname能够作为奖励模型有效扩展高质量图像编辑训练数据，其强对齐性表明在强化学习后训练和测试时扩展等高级应用中具有潜力。

Abstract: Recently, we have witnessed great progress in image editing with natural
language instructions. Several closed-source models like GPT-Image-1, Seedream,
and Google-Nano-Banana have shown highly promising progress. However, the
open-source models are still lagging. The main bottleneck is the lack of a
reliable reward model to scale up high-quality synthetic training data. To
address this critical bottleneck, we built \mname, trained with our new
large-scale human preference dataset, meticulously annotated by trained experts
following a rigorous protocol containing over 200K preference pairs. \mname
demonstrates superior alignment with human preferences in instruction-guided
image editing tasks. Experiments show that \mname achieves state-of-the-art
human correlation on established benchmarks such as GenAI-Bench, AURORA-Bench,
ImagenHub, and our new \benchname, outperforming a wide range of VLM-as-judge
models. Furthermore, we use \mname to select a high-quality subset from the
existing noisy ShareGPT-4o-Image dataset. We train Step1X-Edit on the selected
subset, which shows significant improvement over training on the full set. This
demonstrates \mname's ability to serve as a reward model to scale up
high-quality training data for image editing. Furthermore, its strong alignment
suggests potential for advanced applications like reinforcement learning-based
post-training and test-time scaling of image editing models. \mname with its
training dataset will be released to help the community build more high-quality
image editing training datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了任务导向时序定位(ToTG)新问题，并构建了ToTG Bench基准。为解决长视频中关键时刻定位的挑战，开发了基于渐进推理的TimeScope框架，通过粗粒度范围识别和细粒度时刻划分来精确定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在长视频中识别关键时刻对于下游理解和推理任务至关重要，传统方法由于泛化能力有限和处理长视频困难而面临挑战。

Method: 提出TimeScope框架，采用渐进推理方法：首先在长视频中识别可能包含关键时刻的粗粒度时间范围，然后通过细粒度时刻划分来细化该范围。

Result: 大量实验表明，TimeScope在各种设置下始终优于现有的时序定位方法和流行的MLLMs，突显了其解决这一新挑战性问题的有效性。

Conclusion: TimeScope通过渐进推理方法有效解决了任务导向时序定位问题，在长视频关键时刻定位方面表现出色。

Abstract: Identifying key moments in long videos is essential for downstream
understanding and reasoning tasks. In this paper, we introduce a new problem,
Taskoriented Temporal Grounding ToTG, which aims to localize time intervals
containing the necessary information based on a task's natural description.
Along with the definition, we also present ToTG Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating the performance on ToTG. ToTG is particularly
challenging for traditional approaches due to their limited generalizability
and difficulty in handling long videos. To address these challenges, we propose
TimeScope, a novel framework built upon progressive reasoning. TimeScope first
identifies a coarse-grained temporal scope in the long video that likely
contains the key moments, and then refines this scope through finegrained
moment partitioning. Additionally, we curate a highquality dataset, namely ToTG
Pile, to enhance TimeScope's ability to perform progressive temporal grounding
effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeScope consistently
outperforms both existing temporalgrounding methods and popular MLLMs across
various settings, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing this new
challenging problem.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScalingAR是首个专为基于下一词预测的自回归图像生成设计的测试时缩放框架，无需早期解码或辅助奖励，通过令牌熵作为新信号，在配置文件和策略两个层级进行自适应优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时缩放方法依赖频繁的部分解码和外部奖励模型，不适用于基于下一词预测的自回归图像生成，因为中间解码结果不完整。

Method: 使用令牌熵作为视觉令牌生成的新信号，在配置文件层级融合内在和条件信号流式传输校准的置信状态，在策略层级利用该状态自适应终止低置信轨迹并动态调度指导强度。

Result: 在通用和组合基准测试中，ScalingAR将基础模型在GenEval上提升12.5%，在TIIF-Bench上提升15.2%，视觉令牌消耗减少62.0%的同时超越基线，在挑战性场景中缓解性能下降26.0%。

Conclusion: ScalingAR成功填补了测试时缩放在自回归图像生成中的应用空白，通过创新的令牌熵信号和双层级自适应机制，显著提升了生成质量和效率。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing
large language models, yet its application to next-token prediction (NTP)
autoregressive (AR) image generation remains largely uncharted. Existing TTS
approaches for visual AR (VAR), which rely on frequent partial decoding and
external reward models, are ill-suited for NTP-based image generation due to
the inherent incompleteness of intermediate decoding results. To bridge this
gap, we introduce ScalingAR, the first TTS framework specifically designed for
NTP-based AR image generation that eliminates the need for early decoding or
auxiliary rewards. ScalingAR leverages token entropy as a novel signal in
visual token generation and operates at two complementary scaling levels: (i)
Profile Level, which streams a calibrated confidence state by fusing intrinsic
and conditional signals; and (ii) Policy Level, which utilizes this state to
adaptively terminate low-confidence trajectories and dynamically schedule
guidance for phase-appropriate conditioning strength. Experiments on both
general and compositional benchmarks show that ScalingAR (1) improves base
models by 12.5% on GenEval and 15.2% on TIIF-Bench, (2) efficiently reduces
visual token consumption by 62.0% while outperforming baselines, and (3)
successfully enhances robustness, mitigating performance drops by 26.0% in
challenging scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出PANDA系统，基于MLLMs实现无需训练数据和人工干预的通用视频异常检测，通过自适应策略规划、启发式推理、工具增强反思和记忆链自改进四大能力，在多种场景下达到最先进性能。


<details>

Motivation: 传统视频异常检测方法依赖特定领域训练数据和人工调整，存在高劳动成本和泛化能力有限的问题，因此需要开发能够自动处理任何场景和异常类型的通用检测系统。

Method: 基于MLLMs构建PANDA代理系统，包含四个核心能力：自适应场景感知策略规划、目标驱动启发式推理、工具增强自我反思、自改进记忆链机制，具体包括场景感知RAG、潜在异常引导提示策略、渐进反思机制和上下文感知工具。

Result: 在多种场景、开放集和复杂场景设置下的广泛实验表明，PANDA无需训练和人工干预即可实现最先进的性能，验证了其通用和鲁棒的异常检测能力。

Conclusion: PANDA成功实现了通用视频异常检测，通过智能代理系统解决了传统方法的局限，为无需训练和人工干预的异常检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a critical yet challenging task due to the
complex and diverse nature of real-world scenarios. Previous methods typically
rely on domain-specific training data and manual adjustments when applying to
new scenarios and unseen anomaly types, suffering from high labor costs and
limited generalization. Therefore, we aim to achieve generalist VAD, i.e.,
automatically handle any scene and any anomaly types without training data or
human involvement. In this work, we propose PANDA, an agentic AI engineer based
on MLLMs. Specifically, we achieve PANDA by comprehensively devising four key
capabilities: (1) self-adaptive scene-aware strategy planning, (2) goal-driven
heuristic reasoning, (3) tool-augmented self-reflection, and (4) self-improving
chain-of-memory. Concretely, we develop a self-adaptive scene-aware RAG
mechanism, enabling PANDA to retrieve anomaly-specific knowledge for anomaly
detection strategy planning. Next, we introduce a latent anomaly-guided
heuristic prompt strategy to enhance reasoning precision. Furthermore, PANDA
employs a progressive reflection mechanism alongside a suite of context-aware
tools to iteratively refine decision-making in complex scenarios. Finally, a
chain-of-memory mechanism enables PANDA to leverage historical experiences for
continual performance improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PANDA
achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scenario, open-set, and complex
scenario settings without training and manual involvement, validating its
generalizable and robust anomaly detection capability. Code is released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散模型的图像到视频生成在运动真实性方面仍面临挑战，难以准确建模复杂的物理约束、物体交互和领域特定动态。

Method: 1) 基于检索的流水线提取高级运动特征；2) 通过因果变换器架构实现上下文学习进行运动适应；3) 基于注意力的运动注入适配器将转移的运动特征集成到预训练视频扩散模型中。

Result: 在多个领域和各种基础模型上均取得显著改进，推理时计算开销可忽略不计，模块化设计支持通过更新检索数据库实现零样本泛化到新领域。

Conclusion: 该研究通过有效检索和转移运动先验，增强了视频生成系统的核心能力，促进了真实运动动态的合成。

Abstract: Image-to-video generation has made remarkable progress with the advancements
in diffusion models, yet generating videos with realistic motion remains highly
challenging. This difficulty arises from the complexity of accurately modeling
motion, which involves capturing physical constraints, object interactions, and
domain-specific dynamics that are not easily generalized across diverse
scenarios. To address this, we propose MotionRAG, a retrieval-augmented
framework that enhances motion realism by adapting motion priors from relevant
reference videos through Context-Aware Motion Adaptation (CAMA). The key
technical innovations include: (i) a retrieval-based pipeline extracting
high-level motion features using video encoder and specialized resamplers to
distill semantic motion representations; (ii) an in-context learning approach
for motion adaptation implemented through a causal transformer architecture;
(iii) an attention-based motion injection adapter that seamlessly integrates
transferred motion features into pretrained video diffusion models. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements
across multiple domains and various base models, all with negligible
computational overhead during inference. Furthermore, our modular design
enables zero-shot generalization to new domains by simply updating the
retrieval database without retraining any components. This research enhances
the core capability of video generation systems by enabling the effective
retrieval and transfer of motion priors, facilitating the synthesis of
realistic motion dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超分辨率模型评估使用平均分数，无法反映模型在不同难度图像上的表现差异，也无法检测某些困难图像上产生的伪影问题。

Method: 提出两种图像难度度量指标：高频指数和旋转不变边缘指数，用于预测模型在哪些测试图像上会产生显著的视觉差异，并设计相应的评估方法。

Result: 实验结果表明所提出的图像难度度量和评估方法能够有效区分产生不同视觉结果的超分辨率模型。

Conclusion: 基于图像难度感知的评估方法能够更好地反映超分辨率模型在实际应用中的性能差异，弥补传统平均分数评估的局限性。

Abstract: Image super-resolution models are commonly evaluated by average scores (over
some benchmark test sets), which fail to reflect the performance of these
models on images of varying difficulty and that some models generate artifacts
on certain difficult images, which is not reflected by the average scores. We
propose difficulty-aware performance evaluation procedures to better
differentiate between SISR models that produce visually different results on
some images but yield close average performance scores over the entire test
set. In particular, we propose two image-difficulty measures, the
high-frequency index and rotation-invariant edge index, to predict those test
images, where a model would yield significantly better visual results over
another model, and an evaluation method where these visual differences are
reflected on objective measures. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed image-difficulty measures and evaluation
methodology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前单尺度模型在细粒度恢复和全局一致性方面存在困难，需要更有效的去雨方法以提升自动驾驶等关键视觉任务的清晰度。

Method: 三阶段渐进框架：CENet进行粗提取，SFNet使用混合注意力UNet和混合域Mamba进行多尺度特征聚合和空间语义建模，RNet通过原始分辨率子网络恢复细粒度结构。

Result: 在多个数据集上取得了竞争性结果，能够有效学习高频雨特征同时保持结构细节和全局上下文。

Conclusion: PRISM框架通过渐进式多阶段处理和混合域建模，显著提升了图像去雨的质量和效果。

Abstract: Image deraining is an essential vision technique that removes rain streaks
and water droplets, enhancing clarity for critical vision tasks like autonomous
driving. However, current single-scale models struggle with fine-grained
recovery and global consistency. To address this challenge, we propose
Progressive Rain removal with Integrated State-space Modeling (PRISM), a
progressive three-stage framework: Coarse Extraction Network (CENet), Frequency
Fusion Network (SFNet), and Refine Network (RNet). Specifically, CENet and
SFNet utilize a novel Hybrid Attention UNet (HA-UNet) for multi-scale feature
aggregation by combining channel attention with windowed spatial transformers.
Moreover, we propose Hybrid Domain Mamba (HDMamba) for SFNet to jointly model
spatial semantics and wavelet domain characteristics. Finally, RNet recovers
the fine-grained structures via an original-resolution subnetwork. Our model
learns high-frequency rain characteristics while preserving structural details
and maintaining global context, leading to improved image quality. Our method
achieves competitive results on multiple datasets against recent deraining
methods.

TL;DR: 提出QuaRTZ方法，通过残差截断和零抑制实现扩散模型的4位量化，在保持纹理细节的同时减少计算需求


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然能生成高质量图像，但计算需求高，部署困难。现有的8位量化方法效果良好，但扩展到4位时由于步长增大导致舍入误差增加，会丢失细粒度纹理

Method: QuaRTZ采用8位最小-最大量化处理异常值，然后通过前导零抑制压缩到4位以保留最低有效位，从而保持纹理细节。该方法平衡了异常值保留和LSB精度

Result: 4位QuaRTZ在FLUX.1-schnell上达到6.98的FID分数，优于需要辅助FP16分支的SVDQuant方法

Conclusion: QuaRTZ通过理论推导和实证评估证明了其在不同激活分布上的通用性，成功实现了扩散模型的高效4位量化

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve high-quality image generation but face deployment
challenges due to their high computational requirements. Although 8-bit
outlier-aware post-training quantization (PTQ) matches full-precision
performance, extending PTQ to 4 bits remains challenging. Larger step sizes in
4-bit quantization amplify rounding errors in dense, low-magnitude activations,
leading to the loss of fine-grained textures. We hypothesize that not only
outliers but also small activations are critical for texture fidelity. To this
end, we propose Quantization via Residual Truncation and Zero Suppression
(QuaRTZ), a 4-bit PTQ scheme for diffusion models. QuaRTZ applies 8-bit min-max
quantization for outlier handling and compresses to 4 bits via leading-zero
suppression to retain LSBs, thereby preserving texture details. Our approach
reduces rounding errors and improves quantization efficiency by balancing
outlier preservation and LSB precision. Both theoretical derivations and
empirical evaluations demonstrate the generalizability of QuaRTZ across diverse
activation distributions. Notably, 4-bit QuaRTZ achieves an FID of 6.98 on
FLUX.1-schnell, outperforming SVDQuant that requires auxiliary FP16 branches.

Abstract: Ensuring that every vehicle leaving a modern production line is built to the
correct \emph{variant} specification and is free from visible defects is an
increasingly complex challenge. We present the \textbf{Automated Vehicle
Inspection (AVI)} platform, an end-to-end, \emph{multi-view} perception system
that couples deep-learning detectors with a semantic rule engine to deliver
\emph{variant-aware} quality control in real time. Eleven synchronized cameras
capture a full 360{\deg} sweep of each vehicle; task-specific views are then
routed to specialised modules: YOLOv8 for part detection, EfficientNet for
ICE/EV classification, Gemini-1.5 Flash for mascot OCR, and YOLOv8-Seg for
scratch-and-dent segmentation. A view-aware fusion layer standardises evidence,
while a VIN-conditioned rule engine compares detected features against the
expected manifest, producing an interpretable pass/fail report in \(\approx\!
300\,\text{ms}\). On a mixed data set of Original Equipment Manufacturer(OEM)
vehicle data sets of four distinct models plus public scratch/dent images, AVI
achieves \textbf{ 93 \%} verification accuracy, \textbf{86 \%} defect-detection

no segmentation baselines by large margins. To our knowledge, this is the first
publicly reported system that unifies multi-camera feature validation with
defect detection in a deployable automotive setting in industry.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stylos是一个单次前向传播的3D高斯框架，用于3D风格迁移，能够处理无位姿的内容（从单张图像到多视角集合），并基于单独的参考风格图像进行条件化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D风格迁移方法通常需要逐场景优化或预计算位姿，这限制了其效率和泛化能力。Stylos旨在实现无需逐场景优化或预定位姿的3D风格迁移，同时保持几何感知和视角一致的风格化效果。

Method: Stylos采用Transformer主干网络，包含两条路径：几何预测路径保留自注意力以保持几何保真度，风格注入路径通过全局交叉注意力在不同视角间强制视觉一致性。此外，还引入了基于体素的3D风格损失，将聚合的场景特征与风格统计量对齐。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，Stylos能够实现高质量的零样本风格化，证明了全局风格-内容耦合、提出的3D风格损失以及从单视角到大规模多视角设置的可扩展性的有效性。

Conclusion: Stylos通过单次前向传播实现了无需逐场景优化或预定位姿的3D风格迁移，在保持几何保真度的同时实现了视角一致的风格化，并具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: We present Stylos, a single-forward 3D Gaussian framework for 3D style
transfer that operates on unposed content, from a single image to a multi-view
collection, conditioned on a separate reference style image. Stylos synthesizes
a stylized 3D Gaussian scene without per-scene optimization or precomputed
poses, achieving geometry-aware, view-consistent stylization that generalizes
to unseen categories, scenes, and styles. At its core, Stylos adopts a
Transformer backbone with two pathways: geometry predictions retain
self-attention to preserve geometric fidelity, while style is injected via
global cross-attention to enforce visual consistency across views. With the
addition of a voxel-based 3D style loss that aligns aggregated scene features
to style statistics, Stylos enforces view-consistent stylization while
preserving geometry. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that
Stylos delivers high-quality zero-shot stylization, highlighting the
effectiveness of global style-content coupling, the proposed 3D style loss, and
the scalability of our framework from single view to large-scale multi-view
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 室内场景分类在计算机视觉中至关重要，特别是在敏感内容分析如儿童性虐待图像分类方面。传统方法面临对象间复杂关系和空间布局的挑战

Method: 将图像转换为场景图，然后使用图注意力网络进行推理，直接建模场景组件之间的交互

Result: 在Places8数据集上达到81.27%的平衡准确率，超过基于图像的方法；在实际儿童性虐待图像评估中获得74.27%的平衡准确率

Conclusion: 结构化场景表示为室内场景分类和儿童性虐待图像分类提供了强大的范例，具有内在可解释性和隐私保护优势

Abstract: Indoor scene classification is a critical task in computer vision, with
wide-ranging applications that go from robotics to sensitive content analysis,
such as child sexual abuse imagery (CSAI) classification. The problem is
particularly challenging due to the intricate relationships between objects and
complex spatial layouts. In this work, we propose the Attention over Scene
Graphs for Sensitive Content Analysis (ASGRA), a novel framework that operates
on structured graph representations instead of raw pixels. By first converting
images into Scene Graphs and then employing a Graph Attention Network for
inference, ASGRA directly models the interactions between a scene's components.
This approach offers two key benefits: (i) inherent explainability via object
and relationship identification, and (ii) privacy preservation, enabling model
training without direct access to sensitive images. On Places8, we achieve
81.27% balanced accuracy, surpassing image-based methods. Real-world CSAI
evaluation with law enforcement yields 74.27% balanced accuracy. Our results
establish structured scene representations as a robust paradigm for indoor
scene classification and CSAI classification. Code is publicly available at

Abstract: Betel leaf is an important crop because of its economic advantages and
widespread use. Its betel vines are susceptible to a number of illnesses that
are commonly referred to as betel leaf disease. Plant diseases are the largest
threat to the food supply's security, and they are challenging to identify in
time to stop possible financial damage. Interestingly, artificial intelligence
can leave a big mark on the betel leaf industry since it helps with output
growth by forecasting sickness. This paper presents a lightweight CBAM-CNN
model with just 2.13 million parameters (8.13 MB), incorporating CBAM
(Convolutional Block Attention Module) to improve feature emphasis without
depending on heavy pre-trained networks. The model's capacity to discern minute
variations among leaf disease classes is improved by the integrated attention
mechanism, which allows it to adaptively focus on significant spatial and
channel-wise information. In order to ensure class balance and diversity for
efficient model training and validation, this work makes use of an enriched
dataset of 10,185 images divided into three categories: Healthy Leaf, Leaf Rot,
and Leaf Spot. The proposed model achieved a precision of 97%, recall of 94%,
and F1 score of 95%, and 95.58% accuracy on the test set demonstrating strong
and balanced classification performance outperforming traditional pre trained
CNN models. The model's focus regions were visualized and interpreted using
Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping), an explainable AI
technique.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种从用户移动轨迹重建空间布局（如家庭平面图）的逆问题解决方案，使用基于扩散的后验采样器，并通过对比学习在嵌入空间中重新定义似然分数来解决路径规划过程不可逆、不可微的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从移动轨迹重建空间布局是一个不适定问题，因为多个平面图可以解释相同的移动轨迹。现有的生成逆求解器面临路径规划过程不可逆、不可微的挑战，导致优化不稳定。

Method: 采用扩散基后验采样器，在对比学习训练的嵌入空间中重新定义似然分数，使兼容的平面图和轨迹在嵌入空间中靠近，不匹配的则远离，从而近似真实似然分数来指导去噪过程。

Result: 实验表明，CoGuide模型能够从轨迹生成更一致的平面图，比可微分规划器基线和引导扩散方法更稳健。

Conclusion: 通过在嵌入空间中重新定义似然分数，可以有效地解决从移动轨迹重建空间布局的逆问题，该方法比现有方法产生更一致和稳健的结果。

Abstract: We consider the inverse problem of reconstructing the spatial layout of a
place, a home floorplan for example, from a user`s movements inside that
layout. Direct inversion is ill-posed since many floorplans can explain the
same movement trajectories. We adopt a diffusion-based posterior sampler to
generate layouts consistent with the measurements. While active research is in
progress on generative inverse solvers, we find that the forward operator in
our problem poses new challenges. The path-planning process inside a floorplan
is a non-invertible, non-differentiable function, and causes instability while
optimizing using the likelihood score. We break-away from existing approaches
and reformulate the likelihood score in a smoother embedding space. The
embedding space is trained with a contrastive loss which brings compatible
floorplans and trajectories close to each other, while pushing mismatched pairs
far apart. We show that a surrogate form of the likelihood score in this
embedding space is a valid approximation of the true likelihood score, making
it possible to steer the denoising process towards the posterior. Across
extensive experiments, our model CoGuide produces more consistent floorplans
from trajectories, and is more robust than differentiable-planner baselines and
guided-diffusion methods.

Result: 生成的指令调优模型在十亿参数模型中达到最先进性能，在严格硬件约束下表现出强泛化能力，并在各种任务中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 为昇腾边缘设备开发高性能语言模型提供了实用高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
advanced the capabilities of artificial intelligence across various domains.
However, their massive scale and high computational costs render them
unsuitable for direct deployment in resource-constrained edge environments.
This creates a critical need for high-performance small models that can operate
efficiently at the edge. Yet, after pre-training alone, these smaller models
often fail to meet the performance requirements of complex tasks. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a systematic post-training pipeline that efficiently
enhances small model accuracy. Our post training pipeline consists of
curriculum-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and offline on-policy knowledge
distillation. The resulting instruction-tuned model achieves state-of-the-art
performance among billion-parameter models, demonstrating strong generalization
under strict hardware constraints while maintaining competitive accuracy across
a variety of tasks. This work provides a practical and efficient solution for
developing high-performance language models on Ascend edge devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度补全方法假设理想dToF输入和完美对齐，忽略了实际应用中的校准误差和异常，限制了真实世界的适用性。

Method: 1) 基于合成数据集的模拟方法生成真实训练样本；2) 无学习参数异常检测机制识别错误测量；3) 针对噪声dToF输入的深度补全网络，集成RGB图像和单目深度估计先验。

Result: 在ZJU-L5数据集上RMSE和Rel分别提升22%和11%；在Mirror3D-NYU数据集上镜面区域性能提升37%；在Hammer数据集上超越L515测量结果22%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了深度补全的鲁棒性和性能，使低成本dToF传感器能够超越高端设备，具有广泛的现实应用潜力。

Abstract: Depth enhancement, which converts raw dToF signals into dense depth maps
using RGB guidance, is crucial for improving depth perception in high-precision
tasks such as 3D reconstruction and SLAM. However, existing methods often
assume ideal dToF inputs and perfect dToF-RGB alignment, overlooking
calibration errors and anomalies, thus limiting real-world applicability. This
work systematically analyzes the noise characteristics of real-world
lightweight dToF sensors and proposes a practical and novel depth completion
framework, DEPTHOR++, which enhances robustness to noisy dToF inputs from three
key aspects. First, we introduce a simulation method based on synthetic
datasets to generate realistic training samples for robust model training.
Second, we propose a learnable-parameter-free anomaly detection mechanism to
identify and remove erroneous dToF measurements, preventing misleading
propagation during completion. Third, we design a depth completion network
tailored to noisy dToF inputs, which integrates RGB images and pre-trained
monocular depth estimation priors to improve depth recovery in challenging
regions. On the ZJU-L5 dataset and real-world samples, our training strategy
significantly boosts existing depth completion models, with our model achieving
state-of-the-art performance, improving RMSE and Rel by 22% and 11% on average.
On the Mirror3D-NYU dataset, by incorporating the anomaly detection method, our
model improves upon the previous SOTA by 37% in mirror regions. On the Hammer
dataset, using simulated low-cost dToF data from RealSense L515, our method
surpasses the L515 measurements with an average gain of 22%, demonstrating its
potential to enable low-cost sensors to outperform higher-end devices.
Qualitative results across diverse real-world datasets further validate the
effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.

Motivation: 现有视频生成模型和基准测试未能捕捉专业视频生成的复杂性和需求，需要建立面向专业电影制作的结构化评估框架。

Method: 构建包含76个控制节点的四个层次化分类法，开发自动化的提示分类和问题生成流程，进行大规模人工研究（10+模型、20K视频、80+电影专业人士标注），并训练自动评估器。

Result: 即使最强的现有模型在Events和Camera相关控制方面仍存在显著差距，训练的自动评估器在专家标注对齐方面优于现有零样本基线。

Conclusion: SCINE是首个将专业视频生成置于视频生成模型背景下的方法，通过以电影控制为中心的分类法和结构化评估流程指导未来研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have enabled high-fidelity video
synthesis from user provided prompts. However, existing models and benchmarks
fail to capture the complexity and requirements of professional video
generation. Towards that goal, we introduce Stable Cinemetrics, a structured
evaluation framework that formalizes filmmaking controls into four
disentangled, hierarchical taxonomies: Setup, Event, Lighting, and Camera.
Together, these taxonomies define 76 fine-grained control nodes grounded in
industry practices. Using these taxonomies, we construct a benchmark of prompts
aligned with professional use cases and develop an automated pipeline for
prompt categorization and question generation, enabling independent evaluation
of each control dimension. We conduct a large-scale human study spanning 10+
models and 20K videos, annotated by a pool of 80+ film professionals. Our
analysis, both coarse and fine-grained reveal that even the strongest current
models exhibit significant gaps, particularly in Events and Camera-related
controls. To enable scalable evaluation, we train an automatic evaluator, a
vision-language model aligned with expert annotations that outperforms existing
zero-shot baselines. SCINE is the first approach to situate professional video
generation within the landscape of video generative models, introducing
taxonomies centered around cinematic controls and supporting them with
structured evaluation pipelines and detailed analyses to guide future research.

Conclusion: 机器学习方法能有效自动化连接组学校对流程，大幅降低人工成本并提高效率。

Abstract: Producing connectomes from electron microscopy (EM) images has historically
required a great deal of human proofreading effort. This manual annotation cost
is the current bottleneck in scaling EM connectomics, for example, in making
larger connectome reconstructions feasible, or in enabling comparative
connectomics where multiple related reconstructions are produced. In this work,
we propose using the available ground-truth data generated by this manual
annotation effort to learn a machine learning model to automate or optimize
parts of the required proofreading workflows. We validate our approach on a
recent complete reconstruction of the \emph{Drosophila} male central nervous
system. We first show our method would allow for obtaining 90\% of the value of
a guided proofreading workflow while reducing required cost by 80\%. We then
demonstrate a second application for automatically merging many segmentation
fragments to proofread neurons. Our system is able to automatically attach 200
thousand fragments, equivalent to four proofreader years of manual work, and
increasing the connectivity completion rate of the connectome by 1.3\% points.

TL;DR: DiffCamera是一个基于扩散变换器的模型，能够根据任意新的焦点和模糊程度对已拍摄图像进行灵活重聚焦，解决了传统景深效果固定且难以修改的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统摄影中的景深效果一旦拍摄完成就难以修改，当焦点不理想时（如主体失焦）会带来问题。需要一种能够灵活调整图像焦点和模糊程度的方法。

Method: 设计扩散变换器框架进行重聚焦学习，通过模拟流程生成大规模不同焦点平面和虚化程度的图像对数据，并引入基于摄影原理的堆叠约束来增强训练效果。

Result: 实验表明DiffCamera能够在各种场景下稳定地进行重聚焦，为摄影和生成AI应用提供了前所未有的景深调整控制能力。

Conclusion: DiffCamera通过创新的扩散变换器框架和物理基础的训练约束，成功实现了对已拍摄图像的灵活重聚焦，解决了传统景深效果固定的限制。

Abstract: The depth-of-field (DoF) effect, which introduces aesthetically pleasing
blur, enhances photographic quality but is fixed and difficult to modify once
the image has been created. This becomes problematic when the applied blur is
undesirable~(e.g., the subject is out of focus). To address this, we propose
DiffCamera, a model that enables flexible refocusing of a created image
conditioned on an arbitrary new focus point and a blur level. Specifically, we
design a diffusion transformer framework for refocusing learning. However, the
training requires pairs of data with different focus planes and bokeh levels in
the same scene, which are hard to acquire. To overcome this limitation, we
develop a simulation-based pipeline to generate large-scale image pairs with
varying focus planes and bokeh levels. With the simulated data, we find that
training with only a vanilla diffusion objective often leads to incorrect DoF
behaviors due to the complexity of the task. This requires a stronger
constraint during training. Inspired by the photographic principle that photos
of different focus planes can be linearly blended into a multi-focus image, we
propose a stacking constraint during training to enforce precise DoF
manipulation. This constraint enhances model training by imposing physically
grounded refocusing behavior that the focusing results should be faithfully
aligned with the scene structure and the camera conditions so that they can be
combined into the correct multi-focus image. We also construct a benchmark to
evaluate the effectiveness of our refocusing model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DiffCamera supports stable refocusing across a wide range of
scenes, providing unprecedented control over DoF adjustments for photography
and generative AI applications.

Result: 相比现有最先进方法有显著改进，为可控、高保真Foley合成设定了新标准

Conclusion: SAGANet通过对象级分割实现了细粒度的音频生成控制，并发布了Segmented Music Solos基准数据集

Abstract: Existing multimodal audio generation models often lack precise user control,
which limits their applicability in professional Foley workflows. In
particular, these models focus on the entire video and do not provide precise
methods for prioritizing a specific object within a scene, generating
unnecessary background sounds, or focusing on the wrong objects. To address
this gap, we introduce the novel task of video object segmentation-aware audio
generation, which explicitly conditions sound synthesis on object-level
segmentation maps. We present SAGANet, a new multimodal generative model that
enables controllable audio generation by leveraging visual segmentation masks
along with video and textual cues. Our model provides users with fine-grained
and visually localized control over audio generation. To support this task and
further research on segmentation-aware Foley, we propose Segmented Music Solos,
a benchmark dataset of musical instrument performance videos with segmentation
information. Our method demonstrates substantial improvements over current
state-of-the-art methods and sets a new standard for controllable,
high-fidelity Foley synthesis. Code, samples, and Segmented Music Solos are

Abstract: Facial expression classification remains a challenging task due to the high
dimensionality and inherent complexity of facial image data. This paper
presents Hy-Facial, a hybrid feature extraction framework that integrates both
deep learning and traditional image processing techniques, complemented by a
systematic investigation of dimensionality reduction strategies. The proposed
method fuses deep features extracted from the Visual Geometry Group 19-layer
network (VGG19) with handcrafted local descriptors and the scale-invariant
feature transform (SIFT) and Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) algorithms,
to obtain rich and diverse image representations. To mitigate feature
redundancy and reduce computational complexity, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of dimensionality reduction techniques and feature extraction. Among
these, UMAP is identified as the most effective, preserving both local and
global structures of the high-dimensional feature space. The Hy-Facial pipeline
integrated VGG19, SIFT, and ORB for feature extraction, followed by K-means
clustering and UMAP for dimensionality reduction, resulting in a classification
accuracy of 83. 3\% in the facial expression recognition (FER) dataset. These
findings underscore the pivotal role of dimensionality reduction not only as a
pre-processing step but as an essential component in improving feature quality
and overall classification performance.

Motivation: 解决全景深度估计中由于数据稀缺导致的零样本泛化能力差，以及球面畸变带来的计算效率低下问题。

Method: 1. 开发数据生成引擎从透视图像生成高质量全景深度数据，创建约607K全景RGB-深度对；2. 提出SphereViT，利用球面坐标强制全景图像特征的球面几何一致性；3. 构建完全端到端的全景深度估计器。

Conclusion: DA²通过大规模数据生成和球面几何一致性建模，实现了准确、高效且具有强大零样本泛化能力的全景深度估计，代码和数据集将公开发布。

Abstract: Panorama has a full FoV (360$^\circ\times$180$^\circ$), offering a more
complete visual description than perspective images. Thanks to this
characteristic, panoramic depth estimation is gaining increasing traction in 3D
vision. However, due to the scarcity of panoramic data, previous methods are
often restricted to in-domain settings, leading to poor zero-shot
generalization. Furthermore, due to the spherical distortions inherent in
panoramas, many approaches rely on perspective splitting (e.g., cubemaps),
which leads to suboptimal efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose
$\textbf{DA}$$^{\textbf{2}}$: $\textbf{D}$epth $\textbf{A}$nything in
$\textbf{A}$ny $\textbf{D}$irection, an accurate, zero-shot generalizable, and
fully end-to-end panoramic depth estimator. Specifically, for scaling up
panoramic data, we introduce a data curation engine for generating high-quality
panoramic depth data from perspective, and create $\sim$543K panoramic
RGB-depth pairs, bringing the total to $\sim$607K. To further mitigate the
spherical distortions, we present SphereViT, which explicitly leverages
spherical coordinates to enforce the spherical geometric consistency in
panoramic image features, yielding improved performance. A comprehensive
benchmark on multiple datasets clearly demonstrates DA$^{2}$'s SoTA
performance, with an average 38% improvement on AbsRel over the strongest
zero-shot baseline. Surprisingly, DA$^{2}$ even outperforms prior in-domain
methods, highlighting its superior zero-shot generalization. Moreover, as an
end-to-end solution, DA$^{2}$ exhibits much higher efficiency over fusion-based
approaches. Both the code and the curated panoramic data will be released.

Method: 预测逐像素3D点图、法线和身体对应关系，采用遮挡感知的泊松重建恢复完整几何，并与参数化SMPL-X身体模型对齐，用人体对齐网格初始化高斯溅射。

Result: 在多个数据集上取得SOTA结果：着装网格重建的Chamfer距离提升18-23%，SMPL-X估计的PA-V2V降低6-27%，新视角合成的LPIPS减少15-27%。

Conclusion: 前馈transformer可作为在真实世界场景中进行鲁棒人体重建的可扩展模型。

Abstract: We introduce HART, a unified framework for sparse-view human reconstruction.
Given a small set of uncalibrated RGB images of a person as input, it outputs a
watertight clothed mesh, the aligned SMPL-X body mesh, and a Gaussian-splat
representation for photorealistic novel-view rendering. Prior methods for
clothed human reconstruction either optimize parametric templates, which
overlook loose garments and human-object interactions, or train implicit
functions under simplified camera assumptions, limiting applicability in real
scenes. In contrast, HART predicts per-pixel 3D point maps, normals, and body
correspondences, and employs an occlusion-aware Poisson reconstruction to
recover complete geometry, even in self-occluded regions. These predictions
also align with a parametric SMPL-X body model, ensuring that reconstructed
geometry remains consistent with human structure while capturing loose clothing
and interactions. These human-aligned meshes initialize Gaussian splats to
further enable sparse-view rendering. While trained on only 2.3K synthetic
scans, HART achieves state-of-the-art results: Chamfer Distance improves by
18-23 percent for clothed-mesh reconstruction, PA-V2V drops by 6-27 percent for
SMPL-X estimation, LPIPS decreases by 15-27 percent for novel-view synthesis on
a wide range of datasets. These results suggest that feed-forward transformers
can serve as a scalable model for robust human reconstruction in real-world
settings. Code and models will be released.

### [130] [Learning Generalizable Shape Completion with SIM(3) Equivariance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26631)
*Yuqing Wang,Zhaiyu Chen,Xiao Xiang Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了第一个SIM(3)-等变形状补全网络，通过架构设计使模型对姿态和尺度保持不变，在去偏评估协议下显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D形状补全方法假设扫描已预对齐到规范坐标系，这泄露了姿态和尺度线索，导致模型可能记忆绝对位置而非推断内在几何。当真实数据缺乏这种对齐时，性能会崩溃。

Method: 引入SIM(3)-等变形状补全网络，其模块化层依次规范特征、在相似性不变几何上推理，并恢复原始坐标系。

Result: 在去偏评估协议下，在PCN基准上优于等变和增强基线方法；在KITTI上最小匹配距离降低17%，在OmniObject3D上Chamfer距离降低14%。

Conclusion: 完全SIM(3)等变性是实现真正可泛化形状补全的有效途径，即使在更严格的协议下仍优于有偏设置下的竞争对手。

Abstract: 3D shape completion methods typically assume scans are pre-aligned to a
canonical frame. This leaks pose and scale cues that networks may exploit to
memorize absolute positions rather than inferring intrinsic geometry. When such
alignment is absent in real data, performance collapses. We argue that robust
generalization demands architectural equivariance to the similarity group,
SIM(3), so the model remains agnostic to pose and scale. Following this
principle, we introduce the first SIM(3)-equivariant shape completion network,
whose modular layers successively canonicalize features, reason over
similarity-invariant geometry, and restore the original frame. Under a
de-biased evaluation protocol that removes the hidden cues, our model
outperforms both equivariant and augmentation baselines on the PCN benchmark.
It also sets new cross-domain records on real driving and indoor scans,
lowering minimal matching distance on KITTI by 17% and Chamfer distance $\ell1$
on OmniObject3D by 14%. Perhaps surprisingly, ours under the stricter protocol
still outperforms competitors under their biased settings. These results
establish full SIM(3) equivariance as an effective route to truly generalizable
shape completion. Project page: https://sime-completion.github.io.

*Yuxin Song,Wenkai Dong,Shizun Wang,Qi Zhang,Song Xue,Tao Yuan,Hu Yang,Haocheng Feng,Hang Zhou,Xinyan Xiao,Jingdong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Query-Kontext是一种新型统一多模态模型，通过将多模态生成推理能力委托给VLM，同时保留扩散模型的高质量视觉合成能力，在文本到图像生成和编辑任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前统一多模态框架中，多模态生成推理能力与高保真合成能力内在纠缠，限制了模型性能。

Method: 提出Query-Kontext方法，通过多模态"kontext"连接VLM和扩散模型，采用三阶段渐进训练策略，并构建综合数据管道。

Result: 实验表明该方法与强大的统一基线相匹配，在某些情况下甚至优于特定任务的最先进方法。

Conclusion: Query-Kontext成功解耦了多模态生成推理和高质量视觉合成，为统一多模态模型提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
text-to-image generation (T2I) and editing (TI2I), whether instantiated as
assembled unified frameworks which couple powerful vision-language model (VLM)
with diffusion-based generator, or as naive Unified Multimodal Models with an
early fusion of understanding and generation modalities. We contend that in
current unified frameworks, the crucial capability of multimodal generative
reasoning which encompasses instruction understanding, grounding, and image
referring for identity preservation and faithful reconstruction, is
intrinsically entangled with high-fidelity synthesis. In this work, we
introduce Query-Kontext, a novel approach that bridges the VLM and diffusion
model via a multimodal ``kontext'' composed of semantic cues and coarse-grained
image conditions encoded from multimodal inputs. This design delegates the
complex ability of multimodal generative reasoning to powerful VLM while
reserving diffusion model's role for high-quality visual synthesis. To achieve
this, we propose a three-stage progressive training strategy. First, we connect
the VLM to a lightweight diffusion head via multimodal kontext tokens to
unleash the VLM's generative reasoning ability. Second, we scale this head to a
large, pre-trained diffusion model to enhance visual detail and realism.
Finally, we introduce a low-level image encoder to improve image fidelity and
perform instruction tuning on downstream tasks. Furthermore, we build a
comprehensive data pipeline integrating real, synthetic, and open-source
datasets, covering diverse multimodal reference-to-image scenarios, including
image generation, instruction-driven editing, customized generation, and
multi-subject composition. Experiments show that our approach matches strong
unified baselines and even outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods
in several cases.

*Jessica Bader,Mateusz Pach,Maria A. Bravo,Serge Belongie,Zeynep Akata*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Stitch的无训练方法，通过自动生成的边界框将外部位置控制集成到多模态扩散变换器中，解决了文本到图像生成中空间关系准确性的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像生成模型在空间关系（如"上方"或"右侧"）的准确捕捉方面存在持续挑战，且早期方法与现代模型架构不兼容。

Method: Stitch方法通过自动生成的边界框，在指定区域内生成单个对象，然后无缝拼接它们，利用特定的注意力头在生成过程中隔离和裁剪单个对象。

Result: 在PosEval基准测试中，Stitch显著提升了基础模型的性能，在Qwen-Image上实现了最先进的结果，比先前模型提高了54%，并将FLUX在GenEval位置任务上的性能提升了218%。

Conclusion: Stitch成功地将位置控制集成到领先模型中，无需训练即可实现空间准确且视觉吸引人的图像生成，证明了即使在顶级模型中，基于位置的生成仍有显著改进空间。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models have advanced rapidly in recent years,
but accurately capturing spatial relationships like "above" or "to the right
of" poses a persistent challenge. Earlier methods improved spatial relationship
following with external position control. However, as architectures evolved to
enhance image quality, these techniques became incompatible with modern models.
We propose Stitch, a training-free method for incorporating external position
control into Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiT) via
automatically-generated bounding boxes. Stitch produces images that are both
spatially accurate and visually appealing by generating individual objects
within designated bounding boxes and seamlessly stitching them together. We
find that targeted attention heads capture the information necessary to isolate
and cut out individual objects mid-generation, without needing to fully
complete the image. We evaluate Stitch on PosEval, our benchmark for
position-based T2I generation. Featuring five new tasks that extend the concept
of Position beyond the basic GenEval task, PosEval demonstrates that even top
models still have significant room for improvement in position-based
generation. Tested on Qwen-Image, FLUX, and SD3.5, Stitch consistently enhances
base models, even improving FLUX by 218% on GenEval's Position task and by 206%
on PosEval. Stitch achieves state-of-the-art results with Qwen-Image on
PosEval, improving over previous models by 54%, all accomplished while
integrating position control into leading models training-free. Code is

TL;DR: TTT3R提出了一种基于测试时训练视角的3D重建方法，通过内存状态与观测之间的对齐置信度来动态调整学习率，显著提升了循环神经网络在长序列上的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代循环神经网络在3D重建中因线性时间复杂度而具有竞争力，但在超出训练上下文长度时性能显著下降，表现出有限的长度泛化能力。

Method: 从测试时训练的角度重新审视3D重建基础模型，将其设计视为在线学习问题，利用内存状态与观测之间的对齐置信度推导出内存更新的闭式学习率。

Result: TTT3R显著改善了长度泛化能力，在全局姿态估计上比基线方法提升了2倍，同时以20 FPS的速度运行，仅需6 GB GPU内存处理数千张图像。

Conclusion: 提出的训练无关干预方法TTT3R有效平衡了历史信息保留与新观测适应，为3D重建中的长度泛化问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Modern Recurrent Neural Networks have become a competitive architecture for
3D reconstruction due to their linear-time complexity. However, their
performance degrades significantly when applied beyond the training context
length, revealing limited length generalization. In this work, we revisit the
3D reconstruction foundation models from a Test-Time Training perspective,
framing their designs as an online learning problem. Building on this
perspective, we leverage the alignment confidence between the memory state and
incoming observations to derive a closed-form learning rate for memory updates,
to balance between retaining historical information and adapting to new
observations. This training-free intervention, termed TTT3R, substantially
improves length generalization, achieving a $2\times$ improvement in global
pose estimation over baselines, while operating at 20 FPS with just 6 GB of GPU
memory to process thousands of images. Code available in

TL;DR: BEV-VLM是一个用于自动驾驶轨迹规划的新框架，它利用鸟瞰图特征作为视觉语言模型的视觉输入，相比传统方法在规划准确性和碰撞避免方面有显著提升。


<details>

Motivation: 传统方法依赖原始视觉数据（如相机图像）进行轨迹规划，但BEV表示能提供更压缩和信息丰富的场景描述，与高清地图对齐后形成几何一致的场景表示。

Method: 使用多模态传感器数据（相机和激光雷达）融合生成BEV表示，并与高清地图对齐，形成统一的BEV-HD Map格式，作为视觉语言模型的视觉输入进行轨迹规划。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上的实验结果显示规划准确性提升44.8%，并实现了完全碰撞避免。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型能够有效解释处理过的视觉表示（如BEV特征），扩展了它们在轨迹规划中超越原始图像的适用性。

Abstract: This paper introduces BEV-VLM, a novel framework for trajectory planning in
autonomous driving that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with Bird's-Eye
View (BEV) feature maps as visual inputs. Unlike conventional approaches that
rely solely on raw visual data such as camera images, our method utilizes
highly compressed and informative BEV representations, which are generated by
fusing multi-modal sensor data (e.g., camera and LiDAR) and aligning them with
HD Maps. This unified BEV-HD Map format provides a geometrically consistent and
rich scene description, enabling VLMs to perform accurate trajectory planning.
Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate 44.8% improvements in
planning accuracy and complete collision avoidance. Our work highlights that
VLMs can effectively interpret processed visual representations like BEV
features, expanding their applicability beyond raw images in trajectory
planning.

Motivation: 现有运动规划框架在高风险应用中缺乏足够的可预测性和可重复性，无法满足工业安全和高质量运动数据集创建的需求。

Method: 开发SRMP框架，提供Python和C++ API，支持与MuJoCo、Sapien、Genesis、PyBullet等主流模拟器集成，并包含MoveIt!插件实现硬件部署。

Result: 通过广泛评估，SRMP不仅满足工业和安全性关键应用的严格要求，还在不同机器人系统中为运动规划的一致性设立了新标准。

Conclusion: SRMP填补了现有运动规划工具在可靠性和一致性方面的不足，为高风险机器人应用提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Motion planning is a critical component in any robotic system. Over the
years, powerful tools like the Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL) have been
developed, offering numerous motion planning algorithms. However, existing
frameworks often struggle to deliver the level of predictability and
repeatability demanded by high-stakes applications -- ranging from ensuring
safety in industrial environments to the creation of high-quality motion
datasets for robot learning. Complementing existing tools, we introduce SRMP
(Search-based Robot Motion Planning), a new software framework tailored for
robotic manipulation. SRMP distinguishes itself by generating consistent and
reliable trajectories, and is the first software tool to offer motion planning
algorithms for multi-robot manipulation tasks. SRMP easily integrates with
major simulators, including MuJoCo, Sapien, Genesis, and PyBullet via a Python
and C++ API. SRMP includes a dedicated MoveIt! plugin that enables immediate
deployment on robot hardware and seamless integration with existing pipelines.
Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate in this paper that SRMP not only
meets the rigorous demands of industrial and safety-critical applications but
also sets a new standard for consistency in motion planning across diverse
robotic systems. Visit srmp.readthedocs.io for SRMP documentation and

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视频的阶段感知奖励建模框架，通过联合预测高级任务阶段和细粒度进展来解决长时程、接触丰富的操作任务中演示质量不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模机器人学习在处理长时程、接触丰富的操作（如可变形物体处理）时面临演示质量不一致的挑战，奖励建模能够提供基于进展的信号，将噪声演示转化为稳定的监督。

Method: 引入阶段感知的视频奖励建模框架，自动从自然语言子任务标注中推导奖励标签，克服了可变时长任务中的帧索引标注问题。提出奖励对齐行为克隆(RA-BC)，通过奖励过滤高质量数据并重新加权样本。

Result: 奖励模型在验证和真实机器人测试中优于基线方法。RA-BC在折叠T恤任务中，从平整状态达到83%成功率，从皱褶状态达到67%成功率，远超普通行为克隆的8%和0%成功率。

Conclusion: 奖励建模是实现可扩展、标注高效且鲁棒的长时程操作模仿学习的关键使能技术。

Abstract: Large-scale robot learning has recently shown promise for enabling robots to
perform complex tasks by integrating perception, control, and language
understanding. Yet, it struggles with long-horizon, contact-rich manipulation
such as deformable object handling, where demonstration quality is
inconsistent. Reward modeling offers a natural solution: by providing grounded
progress signals, it transforms noisy demonstrations into stable supervision
that generalizes across diverse trajectories. We introduce a stage-aware,
video-based reward modeling framework that jointly predicts high-level task
stages and fine-grained progress. Reward labels are automatically derived from
natural language subtask annotations, ensuring consistent progress estimation
across variable-length demonstrations. This design overcomes frame-index
labeling, which fails in variable-duration tasks like folding a T-shirt. Our
reward model demonstrates robustness to variability, generalization to
out-of-distribution settings, and strong utility for policy training. Building
on it, we propose Reward-Aligned Behavior Cloning (RA-BC), which filters
high-quality data and reweights samples by reward. Experiments show the reward
model alone outperforms baselines on validation and real robot rollouts.
Integrated into RA-BC, our approach achieves 83\% success on folding T-shirts
from the flattened state and 67\% from the crumpled state -- far surpassing
vanilla behavior cloning, which attains only 8\% and 0\% success. Overall, our
results highlight reward modeling as a key enabler for scalable,
annotation-efficient, and robust imitation learning in long-horizon
manipulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有actor-critic模型在部署时通常直接使用actor策略展开，缺乏更高效的推理策略，需要利用actor-critic架构的完整能力来改进部署效果

Method: 采用并行最佳优先搜索，利用actor网络批量生成动作，critic网络提供成本估计指导搜索，在动作生成和成本估计两个层面实现并行化，并将图扩展分布到多个线程

Result: 在机器人操作任务中验证了方法的有效性，包括无碰撞运动规划和接触丰富的非抓取推动任务

Conclusion: P-ACHS算法通过利用actor-critic架构的完整组件和并行化搜索，显著提高了强化学习模型的推理效率和性能

Abstract: Actor-Critic models are a class of model-free deep reinforcement learning
(RL) algorithms that have demonstrated effectiveness across various robot
learning tasks. While considerable research has focused on improving training
stability and data sampling efficiency, most deployment strategies have
remained relatively simplistic, typically relying on direct actor policy
rollouts. In contrast, we propose \pachs{} (\textit{P}arallel
\textit{A}ctor-\textit{C}ritic \textit{H}euristic \textit{S}earch), an
efficient parallel best-first search algorithm for inference that leverages
both components of the actor-critic architecture: the actor network generates
actions, while the critic network provides cost-to-go estimates to guide the
search. Two levels of parallelism are employed within the search -- actions and
cost-to-go estimates are generated in batches by the actor and critic networks
respectively, and graph expansion is distributed across multiple threads. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in robotic manipulation tasks,
including collision-free motion planning and contact-rich interactions such as
non-prehensile pushing. Visit p-achs.github.io for demonstrations and examples.

Conclusion: CoTaP管道能够有效整合学习型控制和基于模型的合规控制，为人形机器人提供可调节的任务空间合规性。

Abstract: Humanoid whole-body locomotion control is a critical approach for humanoid
robots to leverage their inherent advantages. Learning-based control methods
derived from retargeted human motion data provide an effective means of
addressing this issue. However, because most current human datasets lack
measured force data, and learning-based robot control is largely
position-based, achieving appropriate compliance during interaction with real
environments remains challenging. This paper presents Compliant Task Pipeline
(CoTaP): a pipeline that leverages compliance information in the learning-based
structure of humanoid robots. A two-stage dual-agent reinforcement learning
framework combined with model-based compliance control for humanoid robots is
proposed. In the training process, first a base policy with a position-based
controller is trained; then in the distillation, the upper-body policy is
combined with model-based compliance control, and the lower-body agent is
guided by the base policy. In the upper-body control, adjustable task-space
compliance can be specified and integrated with other controllers through
compliance modulation on the symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifold,
ensuring system stability. We validated the feasibility of the proposed
strategy in simulation, primarily comparing the responses to external
disturbances under different compliance settings.

Conclusion: 该系统成功解决了传统HD地图的局限性，为动态环境下的自动驾驶提供了可行的在线地图生成解决方案。

Abstract: High-definition (HD) maps are essential for autonomous driving, providing
precise information such as road boundaries, lane dividers, and crosswalks to
enable safe and accurate navigation. However, traditional HD map generation is
labor-intensive, expensive, and difficult to maintain in dynamic environments.
To overcome these challenges, we present a real-world deployment of an online
mapping system on a campus golf cart platform equipped with dual front cameras
and a LiDAR sensor. Our work tackles three core challenges: (1) labeling a 3D
HD map for campus environment; (2) integrating and generalizing the SemVecMap
model onboard; and (3) incrementally generating and updating the predicted HD
map to capture environmental changes. By fine-tuning with campus-specific data,
our pipeline produces accurate map predictions and supports continual updates,
demonstrating its practical value in real-world autonomous driving scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出ESL策略用于多机器人多队列系统的在线任务分配，证明该策略在随机到达和切换延迟下的最优性，相比基线方法能显著降低持有成本和平均队列长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多机器人多队列系统的在线任务分配问题，该系统存在随机到达和切换延迟的挑战，需要设计简单有效的实时调度策略。

Method: 提出Exhaustive-Serve-Longest (ESL)策略：当当前位置非空时进行穷尽服务，当空闲时切换到最长未占用的非空位置，并证明该策略在折扣成本马尔可夫决策过程中的最优性。

Result: ESL策略在不同服务器-位置比例和负载下，始终产生更低的折扣持有成本和更小的平均队列长度，行动时间分数显示更多服务和受限的切换。

Conclusion: ESL策略的简单性和鲁棒性使其成为实时多机器人调度系统的实用默认选择。

Abstract: We study online task allocation for multi-robot, multi-queue systems with
stochastic arrivals and switching delays. Time is slotted; each location can
host at most one robot per slot; service consumes one slot; switching between
locations incurs a one-slot travel delay; and arrivals are independent
Bernoulli processes. We formulate a discounted-cost Markov decision process and
propose Exhaustive-Serve-Longest (ESL), a simple real-time policy that serves
exhaustively when the current location is nonempty and, when idle, switches to
a longest unoccupied nonempty location, and we prove the optimality of this
policy. As baselines, we tune a fixed-dwell cyclic policy via a discrete-time
delay expression and implement a first-come-first-serve policy. Across
server-to-location ratios and loads, ESL consistently yields lower discounted
holding cost and smaller mean queue lengths, with action-time fractions showing
more serving and restrained switching. Its simplicity and robustness make ESL a
practical default for real-time multi-robot scheduling systems.

Abstract: Intra-class terrain differences such as water content directly influence a
vehicle's ability to traverse terrain, yet RGB vision systems may fail to
distinguish these properties. Evaluating a terrain's spectral content beyond
red-green-blue wavelengths to the near infrared spectrum provides useful
information for intra-class identification. However, accurate analysis of this
spectral information is highly dependent on ambient illumination. We
demonstrate a system architecture to collect and register multi-wavelength,
hyperspectral images from a mobile robot and describe an approach to
reflectance calibrate cameras under varying illumination conditions. To
showcase the practical applications of our system, HYPER DRIVE, we demonstrate
the ability to calculate vegetative health indices and soil moisture content

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are emerging as a next-generation
paradigm for robotics. We introduce dVLA, a diffusion-based VLA that leverages
a multimodal chain-of-thought to unify visual perception, language reasoning,
and robotic control in a single system. dVLA jointly optimizes perception,
language understanding, and action under a single diffusion objective, enabling
stronger cross-modal reasoning and better generalization to novel instructions
and objects. For practical deployment, we mitigate inference latency by
incorporating two acceleration strategies, a prefix attention mask and KV
caching, yielding up to around times speedup at test-time inference. We
evaluate dVLA in both simulation and the real world: on the LIBERO benchmark,
it achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 96.4% average success rate,
consistently surpassing both discrete and continuous action policies; on a real
Franka robot, it succeeds across a diverse task suite, including a challenging
bin-picking task that requires multi-step planning, demonstrating robust
real-world performance. Together, these results underscore the promise of
unified diffusion frameworks for practical, high-performance VLA robotics.

### [144] [Hierarchical Diffusion Motion Planning with Task-Conditioned Uncertainty-Aware Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25685)
*Amelie Minji Kim,Anqi Wu,Ye Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种分层扩散规划器，在噪声模型中直接嵌入任务和运动结构，使用任务条件化结构化高斯噪声代替标准各向同性高斯噪声，在迷宫导航和机器人块堆叠任务中表现出更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准扩散规划器使用零均值各向同性高斯噪声，无法有效利用任务和运动结构信息。本文旨在通过结构化噪声模型更好地引导轨迹生成过程。

Method: 将扩散过程推广到有偏非各向同性噪声，采用分层结构：上层实例化任务条件化结构化高斯（均值和协方差），下层在该固定先验下对完整轨迹进行去噪。

Result: 在Maze2D目标到达和KUKA块堆叠实验中，相比各向同性基线方法，取得了更高的成功率、更平滑的轨迹和更强的任务对齐性。

Conclusion: 显式结构化噪声过程比简单条件化神经网络提供更多益处，该方法将先验概率质量集中在可行、平滑且语义有意义的轨迹附近，同时保持可处理性。

Abstract: We propose a novel hierarchical diffusion planner that embeds task and motion
structure directly in the noise model. Unlike standard diffusion-based planners
that use zero-mean, isotropic Gaussian noise, we employ a family of
task-conditioned structured Gaussians whose means and covariances are derived
from Gaussian Process Motion Planning (GPMP): sparse, task-centric key states
or their associated timings (or both) are treated as noisy observations to
produce a prior instance. We first generalize the standard diffusion process to
biased, non-isotropic corruption with closed-form forward and posterior
expressions. Building on this, our hierarchy separates prior instantiation from
trajectory denoising: the upper level instantiates a task-conditioned
structured Gaussian (mean and covariance), and the lower level denoises the
full trajectory under that fixed prior. Experiments on Maze2D goal-reaching and
KUKA block stacking show improved success rates, smoother trajectories, and
stronger task alignment compared to isotropic baselines. Ablation studies
indicate that explicitly structuring the corruption process offers benefits
beyond simply conditioning the neural network. Overall, our method concentrates
probability mass of prior near feasible, smooth, and semantically meaningful
trajectories while maintaining tractability. Our project page is available at

TL;DR: OmniNav是一个统一的机器人导航框架，支持指令目标、物体目标、点目标和前沿探索等多种导航范式，采用快慢模块设计提高路径效率和轨迹连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有导航模型在多样化导航范式中缺乏统一解决方案，导致成功率低和泛化能力有限。

Method: 采用轻量级低延迟策略预测连续空间路径点，结合快慢模块设计：快速模块使用短时视觉上下文生成路径点，慢速模块进行长时规划选择子目标。

Result: 在多个导航基准测试中达到最先进性能，支持高达5Hz的控制频率，并通过真实世界部署验证有效性。

Conclusion: OmniNav为具身导航提供了实用见解，为可扩展、高度泛化的机器人智能指明了方向。

Abstract: Embodied navigation presents a core challenge for intelligent robots,
requiring the comprehension of visual environments, natural language
instructions, and autonomous exploration. Existing models often fall short in
offering a unified solution across diverse navigation paradigms, resulting in
low success rates and limited generalization. We introduce OmniNav, a unified
framework addressing instruct-goal, object-goal, point-goal navigation, and
frontier-based exploration within a single architecture. Our approach features
a lightweight, low-latency policy that accurately predicts continuous-space
waypoints (coordinates and orientations). This policy surpasses action-chunk
methods in precision and supports real-world deployment at control frequencies
up to 5 Hz. Architecturally, OmniNav employs a fast-slow system design: a fast
module generates waypoints using short-horizon visual context and subtasks,
while a slow module performs deliberative planning with long-horizon
observations and candidate frontiers to select subsequent subgoals and
subtasks. This collaboration enhances path efficiency and maintains trajectory
coherence, particularly in exploration and memory-intensive scenarios.
Crucially, we identify that the primary bottleneck isn't merely navigation
policy learning, but a robust understanding of general instructions and
objects. To boost generalization, OmniNav integrates large-scale,
general-purpose training datasets, including those for image captioning and
visual recognition, into a joint multi-task regimen. This significantly
improves success rates and robustness. Extensive experiments confirm OmniNav's
state-of-the-art performance across various navigation benchmarks, with
real-world deployment further validating its efficacy. OmniNav provides
practical insights for embodied navigation, charting a scalable path towards
versatile, highly generalizable robotic intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多机器人系统在未知室内环境中的探索和对象搜索主要依赖贪婪的边界分配策略，机器人间协调有限，需要更智能的协调方法。

Method: 结合实时LiDAR扫描处理（边界聚类和门道检测）与多模态LLM推理，基于共享环境地图和机器人状态生成协调的航点分配。

Result: 在6个机器人的大规模环境中，相比贪婪和Voronoi规划器，探索时间加快22.7%，搜索效率提高50%，并能实现基于自然语言的对象搜索。

Conclusion: LLM-MCoX框架通过LLM智能协调显著提升了多机器人系统的探索和搜索性能，并实现了传统算法无法处理的语义级人机交互。

Abstract: Autonomous exploration and object search in unknown indoor environments
remain challenging for multi-robot systems (MRS). Traditional approaches often
rely on greedy frontier assignment strategies with limited inter-robot
coordination. In this work, we introduce LLM-MCoX (LLM-based Multi-robot
Coordinated Exploration and Search), a novel framework that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs) for intelligent coordination of both homogeneous and
heterogeneous robot teams tasked with efficient exploration and target object
search. Our approach combines real-time LiDAR scan processing for frontier
cluster extraction and doorway detection with multimodal LLM reasoning (e.g.,
GPT-4o) to generate coordinated waypoint assignments based on shared
environment maps and robot states. LLM-MCoX demonstrates superior performance
compared to existing methods, including greedy and Voronoi-based planners,
achieving 22.7% faster exploration times and 50% improved search efficiency in
large environments with 6 robots. Notably, LLM-MCoX enables natural
language-based object search capabilities, allowing human operators to provide
high-level semantic guidance that traditional algorithms cannot interpret.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习是视觉-语言-动作模型后训练的有前景途径，但实际部署受到稀疏奖励和不稳定训练的阻碍。

Method: 采用基于动作分块的PPO方法，结合行为克隆使用自收集演示数据，通过聚合连续动作为分块来改善策略的时间一致性和反馈密度，并动态调整PPO目标与行为克隆损失的相对权重。

Result: 在MetaWorld基准测试中表现出优于监督微调的性能，达到0.93的高成功率，平均42.17步完成目标。

Conclusion: 证明了强化学习在VLA后训练中的可行性，为下游VLA应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising avenue for post-training
vision-language-action (VLA) models, but practical deployment is hindered by
sparse rewards and unstable training. This work mitigates these challenges by
introducing an action chunk based on proximal policy optimization (PPO) with
behavior cloning using self-collected demonstrations. Aggregating consecutive
actions into chunks improves the temporal consistency of the policy and the
density of informative feedback. In addition, an auxiliary behavior cloning
loss is applied with a dynamically updated demonstration buffer that
continually collects high-quality task trials during training. The relative
weight between the action-chunked PPO objective and the self behavior clone
auxiliary loss is adapted online to stabilize the post-training process.
Experiments on the MetaWorld benchmark indicate improved performance over
supervised fine-tuning, achieving a high success rate (0.93) and few steps to
success (42.17). These results demonstrate the viability of RL for VLA
post-training and help lay the groundwork for downstream VLA applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统灵巧抓取流程和VLA方法在执行阶段存在姿态不准确问题，特别是在长时程任务中，这影响了整体性能

Method: 设计多分支策略网络，融合多指触觉输入和本体感知来预测精确控制更新，结合物理触觉模型的大规模模拟数据和真实系统数据训练

Result: 在模拟数据上预训练并用少量真实数据微调显著优于仅模拟训练，真实实验验证有效性，仅使用触觉输入实现毫米级抓取精度

Conclusion: 这是首个仅通过多指触觉感知实现任意手内姿态优化的方法

Abstract: Despite progress in both traditional dexterous grasping pipelines and recent
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) approaches, the grasp execution stage remains
prone to pose inaccuracies, especially in long-horizon tasks, which undermines
overall performance. To address this "last-mile" challenge, we propose
TacRefineNet, a tactile-only framework that achieves fine in-hand pose
refinement of known objects in arbitrary target poses using multi-finger
fingertip sensing. Our method iteratively adjusts the end-effector pose based
on tactile feedback, aligning the object to the desired configuration. We
design a multi-branch policy network that fuses tactile inputs from multiple
fingers along with proprioception to predict precise control updates. To train
this policy, we combine large-scale simulated data from a physics-based tactile
model in MuJoCo with real-world data collected from a physical system.
Comparative experiments show that pretraining on simulated data and fine-tuning
with a small amount of real data significantly improves performance over
simulation-only training. Extensive real-world experiments validate the
effectiveness of the method, achieving millimeter-level grasp accuracy using
only tactile input. To our knowledge, this is the first method to enable
arbitrary in-hand pose refinement via multi-finger tactile sensing alone.

Result: 在桌面操作任务中展现优越的数据效率和分布外泛化能力，能处理超出训练分布的对象位置和尺度

Conclusion: 将感知与控制解耦从根本上改善了sim-to-real迁移效果

Abstract: Sim-to-real transfer remains a fundamental challenge in robot manipulation
due to the entanglement of perception and control in end-to-end learning. We
present a decoupled framework that learns each component where it is most
reliable: control policies are trained in simulation with privileged state to
master spatial layouts and manipulation dynamics, while perception is adapted
only at deployment to bridge real observations to the frozen control policy.
Our key insight is that control strategies and action patterns are universal
across environments and can be learned in simulation through systematic
randomization, while perception is inherently domain-specific and must be
learned where visual observations are authentic. Unlike existing end-to-end
approaches that require extensive real-world data, our method achieves strong
performance with only 10-20 real demonstrations by reducing the complex
sim-to-real problem to a structured perception alignment task. We validate our
approach on tabletop manipulation tasks, demonstrating superior data efficiency
and out-of-distribution generalization compared to end-to-end baselines. The
learned policies successfully handle object positions and scales beyond the
training distribution, confirming that decoupling perception from control
fundamentally improves sim-to-real transfer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于流的策略在离策略强化学习中存在训练不稳定问题，这源于流展开过程与残差循环计算的代数等价性，使其容易遭受类似RNN的梯度消失和爆炸问题。

Method: 1) 基于现代序列模型原理重新参数化速度网络，提出Flow-G(门控速度)和Flow-T(解码速度)两种稳定架构；2) 开发基于SAC的算法，通过噪声增强展开实现端到端训练；3) 支持从头开始学习和离线到在线学习。

Conclusion: 通过将流展开重新解释为残差循环计算并应用序列模型稳定技术，成功解决了流策略的训练稳定性问题，为流策略的实际应用提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Training expressive flow-based policies with off-policy reinforcement
learning is notoriously unstable due to gradient pathologies in the multi-step
action sampling process. We trace this instability to a fundamental connection:
the flow rollout is algebraically equivalent to a residual recurrent
computation, making it susceptible to the same vanishing and exploding
gradients as RNNs. To address this, we reparameterize the velocity network
using principles from modern sequential models, introducing two stable
architectures: Flow-G, which incorporates a gated velocity, and Flow-T, which
utilizes a decoded velocity. We then develop a practical SAC-based algorithm,
enabled by a noise-augmented rollout, that facilitates direct end-to-end
training of these policies. Our approach supports both from-scratch and
offline-to-online learning and achieves state-of-the-art performance on
continuous control and robotic manipulation benchmarks, eliminating the need
for common workarounds like policy distillation or surrogate objectives.

Conclusion: DP-AG为连接生物适应性与人工策略学习提供了有前景的方向，通过建模感知-行动动态交互实现了更好的策略学习性能。

Abstract: Existing imitation learning methods decouple perception and action, which
overlooks the causal reciprocity between sensory representations and action
execution that humans naturally leverage for adaptive behaviors. To bridge this
gap, we introduce Action--Guided Diffusion Policy (DP--AG), a unified
representation learning that explicitly models a dynamic interplay between
perception and action through probabilistic latent dynamics. DP--AG encodes
latent observations into a Gaussian posterior via variational inference and
evolves them using an action-guided SDE, where the Vector-Jacobian Product
(VJP) of the diffusion policy's noise predictions serves as a structured
stochastic force driving latent updates. To promote bidirectional learning
between perception and action, we introduce a cycle--consistent contrastive
loss that organizes the gradient flow of the noise predictor into a coherent
perception--action loop, enforcing mutually consistent transitions in both
latent updates and action refinements. Theoretically, we derive a variational
lower bound for the action-guided SDE, and prove that the contrastive objective
enhances continuity in both latent and action trajectories. Empirically, DP--AG
significantly outperforms state--of--the--art methods across simulation
benchmarks and real-world UR5 manipulation tasks. As a result, our DP--AG
offers a promising step toward bridging biological adaptability and artificial
policy learning.

TL;DR: 多旋翼无人机能量最优路径规划研究，发现与传统旅行商问题解存在显著差异（平均1.6%-3.3%，最高14.9%），关键在于协调垂直与水平运动以提高气动效率而非最小化距离。

Motivation: 多旋翼无人机的能量效率是其性能的关键方面，决定了任务范围和持续时间。研究旨在找到3D空间中航点排序的能量最优规划方案。

Method: 基于先前开发的多旋翼第一原理能量动力学模型，研究能量最优规划，并与传统旅行商问题解进行比较分析。

Result: 在大多数情况下（高达95%），能量最优规划解与传统旅行商问题解不同，差异平均为1.6%-3.3%，90百分位数为3.7%-6.5%，最高可达14.9%。

Conclusion: 优化能量消耗的关键不是最小化距离，而是协调垂直和水平运动以提升气动效率。

Abstract: Multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle is a prevailing type of aerial robots with
wide real-world applications. The energy efficiency of the robot is a critical
aspect of its performance, determining the range and duration of the missions
that can be performed. This paper studies the energy-optimal planning of the
multirotor, which aims at finding the optimal ordering of waypoints with the
minimum energy consumption for missions in 3D space. The study is performed
based on a previously developed model capturing first-principle energy dynamics
of the multirotor. We found that in majority of the cases (up to 95%) the
solutions of the energy-optimal planning are different from those of the
traditional traveling salesman problem which minimizes the total distance. The
difference can be as high as 14.9%, with the average at 1.6%-3.3% and 90th
percentile at 3.7%-6.5% depending on the range and number of waypoints in the
mission. We then identified and explained the key features of the
minimum-energy order by correlating to the underlying flight energy dynamics.
It is shown that instead of minimizing the distance, coordination of vertical
and horizontal motion to promote aerodynamic efficiency is the key to
optimizing energy consumption.

Abstract: Enabling robots to execute long-horizon manipulation tasks from free-form
language instructions remains a fundamental challenge in embodied AI. While
vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise as high-level planners, their
deployment in the real world is hindered by two gaps: (i) the scarcity of
large-scale, sequential manipulation data that couples natural language with
multi-step action plans, and (ii) the absence of dense, interpretable rewards
for fine-tuning VLMs on planning objectives. To address these issues, we
propose REVER, a framework that empowers VLMs to generate and validate
long-horizon manipulation plans from natural language instructions in
real-world scenarios. Under REVER we train and release RoboFarseer, a VLM
incentivized to emit chain-of-thought that perform temporal and spatial
reasoning, ensuring physically plausible and logically coherent plans. To
obtain training data, we leverage the Universal Manipulation Interface
framework to capture hardware-agnostic demonstrations of atomic skills. An
automated annotation engine converts each demonstration into
vision-instruction-plan triplet. We introduce a verifiable reward that scores
the generated plan by its ordered bipartite matching overlap with the
ground-truth skill sequence. At run time, the fine-tuned VLM functions both as
a planner and as a monitor, verifying step-wise completion. RoboFarseer matches
or exceeds the performance of proprietary models that are orders of magnitude
larger, while on open-ended planning it surpasses the best baseline by more
than 40%. In real-world, long-horizon tasks, the complete system boosts overall
success by roughly 60% compared with the same low-level controller without the
planner. We will open-source both the dataset and the trained model upon
publication.

Motivation: 柔顺性移动机器人在不确定场景中具有鲁棒性，但由于缺乏刚体假设和形态变化带来的运动学变化，其状态估计具有挑战性。

Method: 使用基于神经网络的状态估计器，结合状态历史记录和直接影响不可靠传感器的机制，在考虑形态变化状态的柔顺中心坐标系中训练网络。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效估计柔顺机器人的状态，显著提高了在户外自主操作中的性能表现。

Abstract: Locomotion robots with active or passive compliance can show robustness to
uncertain scenarios, which can be promising for agricultural, research and
environmental industries. However, state estimation for these robots is
challenging due to the lack of rigid-body assumptions and kinematic changes
from morphing. We propose a method to estimate typical rigid-body states
alongside compliance-related states, such as soft robot shape in different
morphologies and locomotion modes. Our neural network-based state estimator
uses a history of states and a mechanism to directly influence unreliable
sensors. We test our framework on the GOAT platform, a robot capable of passive
compliance and active morphing for extreme outdoor terrain. The network is
trained on motion capture data in a novel compliance-centric frame that
accounts for morphing-related states. Our method predicts shape-related
measurements within 4.2% of the robot's size, velocities within 6.3% and 2.4%
of the top linear and angular speeds, respectively, and orientation within 1.5
degrees. We also demonstrate a 300% increase in travel range during a motor
malfunction when using our estimator for closed-loop autonomous outdoor
operation.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel human-robot interaction (HRI) framework that
enables intuitive gesture-driven control through a capacitance-based woven
tactile skin. Unlike conventional interfaces that rely on panels or handheld
devices, the woven tactile skin integrates seamlessly with curved robot
surfaces, enabling embodied interaction and narrowing the gap between human
intent and robot response. Its woven design combines fabric-like flexibility
with structural stability and dense multi-channel sensing through the
interlaced conductive threads. Building on this capability, we define a
gesture-action mapping of 14 single- and multi-touch gestures that cover
representative robot commands, including task-space motion and auxiliary
functions. A lightweight convolution-transformer model designed for gesture
recognition in real time achieves an accuracy of near-100%, outperforming prior
baseline approaches. Experiments on robot arm tasks, including pick-and-place
and pouring, demonstrate that our system reduces task completion time by up to
57% compared with keyboard panels and teach pendants. Overall, our proposed
framework demonstrates a practical pathway toward more natural and efficient
embodied HRI.

Abstract: In this paper, we present MUVLA, a Map Understanding Vision-Language-Action

unify and structure historical information, encoding spatial context in a
compact and consistent form. MUVLA takes the current and history observations,
as well as the semantic map, as inputs and predicts the action sequence based
on the description of goal object. Furthermore, it amplifies supervision
through reward-guided return modeling based on dense short-horizon progress
signals, enabling the model to develop a detailed understanding of action value
for reward maximization. MUVLA employs a three-stage training pipeline:
learning map-level spatial understanding, imitating behaviors from
mixed-quality demonstrations, and reward amplification. This strategy allows
MUVLA to unify diverse demonstrations into a robust spatial representation and
generate more rational exploration strategies. Experiments on HM3D and Gibson
benchmarks demonstrate that MUVLA achieves great generalization and learns
effective exploration behaviors even from low-quality or partially successful
trajectories.

TL;DR: S³E是一个自监督状态估计器，通过融合毫米波雷达信号频谱和惯性数据，在无需定位真值监督的情况下实现鲁棒准确的定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于雷达点云的定位方案存在点云稀疏、多径效应导致的鬼点以及单啁啾雷达角度分辨率有限等问题，严重影响状态估计性能。

Method: 采用自监督方法，融合雷达信号频谱和惯性信息，引入跨融合技术利用异构数据间的旋转偏移相关性增强空间结构信息。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法实现了鲁棒准确的性能，无需依赖定位真值监督。

Conclusion: 这是首次尝试以互补自监督方式融合雷达频谱和惯性数据实现状态估计的工作。

Abstract: Millimeter-wave radar for state estimation is gaining significant attention
for its affordability and reliability in harsh conditions. Existing
localization solutions typically rely on post-processed radar point clouds as
landmark points. Nonetheless, the inherent sparsity of radar point clouds,
ghost points from multi-path effects, and limited angle resolution in
single-chirp radar severely degrade state estimation performance. To address
these issues, we propose S$^3$E, a \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{S}upervised
\textbf{S}tate \textbf{E}stimator that employs more richly informative radar
signal spectra to bypass sparse points and fuses complementary inertial
information to achieve accurate localization. S$^3$E fully explores the
association between \textit{exteroceptive} radar and \textit{proprioceptive}
inertial sensor to achieve complementary benefits. To deal with limited angle
resolution, we introduce a novel cross-fusion technique that enhances spatial
structure information by exploiting subtle rotational shift correlations across
heterogeneous data. The experimental results demonstrate our method achieves
robust and accurate performance without relying on localization ground truth
supervision. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to achieve
state estimation by fusing radar spectra and inertial data in a complementary
self-supervised manner.

TL;DR: 研究探索机器人情感表达对儿童行为的影响，发现儿童会调整行为以适应机器人情绪状态，但更高表达水平并未带来更强的行为一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着具有人工情感表达能力的机器人发展，需要研究其说服潜力对儿童行为的影响，特别是机器人表达性如何影响儿童的共情反应。

Method: 在试点研究中，22名7-11岁儿童参与人形机器人(QTRobot)合作游戏，测试不同表达水平(仅身体、仅面部、身体和面部)对基本情绪(快乐和悲伤)表达的影响。

Result: 儿童会调整行为以适应机器人推断的情绪状态，但更高表达水平并未导致更强的行为一致性。

Conclusion: 初步结果为思考机器人表达性及其在塑造儿童对机器人社交情感行为中的作用提供了起点。

Abstract: The growing development of robots with artificial emotional expressiveness
raises important questions about their persuasive potential in children's
behavior. While research highlights the pragmatic value of emotional
expressiveness in human social communication, the extent to which robotic
expressiveness can or should influence empathic responses in children is
grounds for debate. In a pilot study with 22 children (aged 7-11) we begin to
explore the ways in which different levels of embodied expressiveness (body
only, face only, body and face) of two basic emotions (happiness and sadness)
displayed by an anthropomorphic robot (QTRobot) might modify children's
behavior in a child-robot cooperative turn-taking game. We observed that
children aligned their behavior to the robot's inferred emotional state.
However, higher levels of expressiveness did not result in increased alignment.
The preliminary results reported here provide a starting point for reflecting
on robotic expressiveness and its role in shaping children's social-emotional
behavior toward robots as social peers in the near future.

TL;DR: 本文提出了平面Signorini条件，将点接触的Signorini定律与质心压力概念统一起来，为刚体平面接触提供了数学一致的计算框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连接机器人学中两个基础原理：防止物体穿透的Signorini定律和用于运动控制的质心压力概念，弥合离散与连续接触模型之间的差距。

Method: 提出平面Signorini条件，这是一个锥互补性公式，能够模拟刚体间的通用平面接触，并证明其与在整个接触面上执行点状Signorini定律等价。

Result: 建立了平面Signorini条件与点接触Signorini定律的等价性，提出了扩展质心压力概念，统一捕捉粘附、分离和倾斜三种物理状态。

Conclusion: 这项工作为处理平面接触提供了数学一致且计算可行的基础，对接触动力学的精确模拟以及运动和控制算法的设计具有重要意义。

Abstract: We present a unifying theoretical result that connects two foundational
principles in robotics: the Signorini law for point contacts, which underpins
many simulation methods for preventing object interpenetration, and the center
of pressure (also known as the zero-moment point), a key concept used in, for
instance, optimization-based locomotion control. Our contribution is the planar
Signorini condition, a conic complementarity formulation that models general
planar contacts between rigid bodies. We prove that this formulation is
equivalent to enforcing the punctual Signorini law across an entire contact
surface, thereby bridging the gap between discrete and continuous contact
models. A geometric interpretation reveals that the framework naturally
captures three physical regimes -sticking, separating, and tilting-within a
unified complementarity structure. This leads to a principled extension of the
classical center of pressure, which we refer to as the extended center of
pressure. By establishing this connection, our work provides a mathematically
consistent and computationally tractable foundation for handling planar
contacts, with implications for both the accurate simulation of contact
dynamics and the design of advanced control and optimization algorithms in
locomotion and manipulation.

Motivation: 在物流和仓库环境中，移动机器人在意外可移动物体中导航的需求日益增长。虽然多智能体路径规划(MAPF)和单智能体可移动障碍物路径规划(PAMO)已有研究，但M-PAMO问题仍未被充分探索。

Method: 首次尝试将流行的冲突搜索(CBS)、优先级规划(PP)与最新的单智能体PAMO规划器PAMO*相结合，共同解决M-PAMO问题。

Result: 在最多20个智能体和数百个可移动障碍物的场景下比较了这些方法的性能，展示了各种方法的优缺点。

Conclusion: 可移动障碍物带来了新的基础性挑战，导致状态空间随智能体和可移动障碍物数量呈指数级增长，需要专门的算法来解决这种空间和时间上的紧密耦合问题。

Abstract: This paper investigates Multi-Agent Path Finding Among Movable Obstacles
(M-PAMO), which seeks collision-free paths for multiple agents from their start
to goal locations among static and movable obstacles. M-PAMO arises in
logistics and warehouses where mobile robots are among unexpected movable
objects. Although Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) and single-agent Path
planning Among Movable Obstacles (PAMO) were both studied, M-PAMO remains
under-explored. Movable obstacles lead to new fundamental challenges as the
state space, which includes both agents and movable obstacles, grows
exponentially with respect to the number of agents and movable obstacles. In
particular, movable obstacles often closely couple agents together spatially
and temporally. This paper makes a first attempt to adapt and fuse the popular
Conflict-Based Search (CBS) and Prioritized Planning (PP) for MAPF, and a
recent single-agent PAMO planner called PAMO*, together to address M-PAMO. We
compare their performance with up to 20 agents and hundreds of movable
obstacles, and show the pros and cons of these approaches.

TL;DR: FBGA是一种新的前向-后向算法，用于计算时间最优速度剖面，支持通用加速度约束，在保持高精度的同时显著降低计算时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么支持任意加速度约束但计算成本高，要么使用保守的箱式约束以提高计算效率，需要在精度和效率之间取得平衡。

Method: FBGA通过前向和后向传递在短离散路径段上最大化速度剖面，同时满足用户定义的性能限制，能够处理复杂的非凸加速度约束。

Result: 在五个赛道和两种车辆类别上测试，FBGA与最优控制基准的操纵和圈时匹配度很高（误差0.11%-0.36%），计算速度提高三个数量级。

Conclusion: FBGA即使在粗离散化情况下仍保持高精度，非常适合在线多查询轨迹规划，已提供开源C++实现。

Abstract: The computation of time-optimal velocity profiles along prescribed paths,
subject to generic acceleration constraints, is a crucial problem in robot
trajectory planning, with particular relevance to autonomous racing. However,
the existing methods either support arbitrary acceleration constraints at high
computational cost or use conservative box constraints for computational
efficiency. We propose FBGA, a new \underline{F}orward-\underline{B}ackward
algorithm with \underline{G}eneric \underline{A}cceleration constraints, which
achieves both high accuracy and low computation time. FBGA operates forward and
backward passes to maximize the velocity profile in short, discretized path
segments, while satisfying user-defined performance limits. Tested on five
racetracks and two vehicle classes, FBGA handles complex, non-convex
acceleration constraints with custom formulations. Its maneuvers and lap times
closely match optimal control baselines (within $0.11\%$-$0.36\%$), while being
up to three orders of magnitude faster. FBGA maintains high accuracy even with
coarse discretization, making it well-suited for online multi-query trajectory
planning. Our open-source \texttt{C++} implementation is available at:

Motivation: 传统机器人设计采用顺序流程（先硬件后控制），限制了硬件能力的充分利用。需要并行优化设计和控制来最大化机器人能力。

Method: EA-CoRL框架包含两个核心组件：设计进化（使用进化算法探索硬件配置）和策略连续适应（跨设计演化微调控制策略以最大化奖励）。

Conclusion: 策略连续适应在机器人协同设计中起着关键作用，EA-CoRL框架能够有效解决传统设计方法的局限性。

Abstract: Humanoid robots have seen significant advancements in both design and
control, with a growing emphasis on integrating these aspects to enhance
overall performance. Traditionally, robot design has followed a sequential
process, where control algorithms are developed after the hardware is
finalized. However, this can be myopic and prevent robots to fully exploit
their hardware capabilities. Recent approaches advocate for co-design,
optimizing both design and control in parallel to maximize robotic
capabilities. This paper presents the Evolutionary Continuous Adaptive RL-based
Co-Design (EA-CoRL) framework, which combines reinforcement learning (RL) with
evolutionary strategies to enable continuous adaptation of the control policy
to the hardware. EA-CoRL comprises two key components: Design Evolution, which
explores the hardware choices using an evolutionary algorithm to identify
efficient configurations, and Policy Continuous Adaptation, which fine-tunes a
task-specific control policy across evolving designs to maximize performance
rewards. We evaluate EA-CoRL by co-designing the actuators (gear ratios) and
control policy of the RH5 humanoid for a highly dynamic chin-up task,
previously unfeasible due to actuator limitations. Comparative results against
state-of-the-art RL-based co-design methods show that EA-CoRL achieves higher
fitness score and broader design space exploration, highlighting the critical
role of continuous policy adaptation in robot co-design.

Motivation: 现有运动重定向方法存在身体形态差异问题，且忽略了重要的人-物和人-环境交互关系，导致生成的运动轨迹存在物理不合理性。

Method: 使用交互网格显式建模并保持智能体、地形和操作对象之间的空间和接触关系，通过最小化拉普拉斯变形和强制运动学约束来生成可行的运动轨迹。

Conclusion: OmniRetarget能够生成高质量的运动数据，使强化学习策略仅需少量奖励项和简单领域随机化就能成功训练人形机器人执行复杂技能。

Abstract: A dominant paradigm for teaching humanoid robots complex skills is to
retarget human motions as kinematic references to train reinforcement learning
(RL) policies. However, existing retargeting pipelines often struggle with the
significant embodiment gap between humans and robots, producing physically
implausible artifacts like foot-skating and penetration. More importantly,
common retargeting methods neglect the rich human-object and human-environment
interactions essential for expressive locomotion and loco-manipulation. To
address this, we introduce OmniRetarget, an interaction-preserving data
generation engine based on an interaction mesh that explicitly models and
preserves the crucial spatial and contact relationships between an agent, the
terrain, and manipulated objects. By minimizing the Laplacian deformation
between the human and robot meshes while enforcing kinematic constraints,
OmniRetarget generates kinematically feasible trajectories. Moreover,
preserving task-relevant interactions enables efficient data augmentation, from
a single demonstration to different robot embodiments, terrains, and object
configurations. We comprehensively evaluate OmniRetarget by retargeting motions
from OMOMO, LAFAN1, and our in-house MoCap datasets, generating over 8-hour
trajectories that achieve better kinematic constraint satisfaction and contact
preservation than widely used baselines. Such high-quality data enables
proprioceptive RL policies to successfully execute long-horizon (up to 30
seconds) parkour and loco-manipulation skills on a Unitree G1 humanoid, trained
with only 5 reward terms and simple domain randomization shared by all tasks,
without any learning curriculum.

Abstract: This research presents a multi-robot system for inpatient care, designed
using swarm intelligence principles and incorporating wearable health sensors,
RF-based communication, and AI-driven decision support. Within a simulated
hospital environment, the system adopts a leader-follower swarm configuration
to perform patient monitoring, medicine delivery, and emergency assistance. Due
to ethical constraints, live patient trials were not conducted; instead,
validation was carried out through controlled self-testing with wearable
sensors. The Leader Robot acquires key physiological parameters, including
temperature, SpO2, heart rate, and fall detection, and coordinates other robots
when required. The Assistant Robot patrols corridors for medicine delivery,
while a robotic arm provides direct drug administration. The swarm-inspired
leader-follower strategy enhanced communication reliability and ensured
continuous monitoring, including automated email alerts to healthcare staff.
The system hardware was implemented using Arduino, Raspberry Pi, NRF24L01 RF

the AI-enabled decision support was able to provide early warnings of abnormal

Conclusion: 提出的SSS-SLAM框架能够有效支持AUV在海带养殖场的安全导航，为海藻养殖自动化提供了可行的技术方案。

Abstract: The transition of seaweed farming to an alternative food source on an
industrial scale relies on automating its processes through smart farming,
equivalent to land agriculture. Key to this process are autonomous underwater
vehicles (AUVs) via their capacity to automate crop and structural inspections.
However, the current bottleneck for their deployment is ensuring safe
navigation within farms, which requires an accurate, online estimate of the AUV
pose and map of the infrastructure. To enable this, we propose an efficient
side scan sonar-based (SSS) simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)
framework that exploits the geometry of kelp farms via modeling structural
ropes in the back-end as sequences of individual landmarks from each SSS ping
detection, instead of combining detections into elongated representations. Our
method outperforms state of the art solutions in hardware in the loop (HIL)
experiments on a real AUV survey in a kelp farm. The framework and dataset can

Conclusion: 所提出的地形感知LiDAR-惯性里程计框架能够有效缓解姿态漂移，在非结构化地形中实现更高的定位精度。

Abstract: An accurate odometry is essential for legged-wheel robots operating in
unstructured terrains such as bumpy roads and staircases. Existing methods
often suffer from pose drift due to their ignorance of terrain geometry. We
propose a terrain-awared LiDAR-Inertial odometry (LIO) framework that
approximates the terrain using Radial Basis Functions (RBF) whose centers are
adaptively selected and weights are recursively updated. The resulting smooth
terrain manifold enables ``soft constraints" that regularize the odometry
optimization and mitigates the $z$-axis pose drift under abrupt elevation
changes during robot's maneuver. To ensure the LIO's real-time performance, we
further evaluate the RBF-related terms and calculate the inverse of the sparse
kernel matrix with GPU parallelization. Experiments on unstructured terrains
demonstrate that our method achieves higher localization accuracy than the
state-of-the-art baselines, especially in the scenarios that have continuous
height changes or sparse features when abrupt height changes occur.

Motivation: 随着人形机器人和定制制造解决方案的快速发展，灵巧操作成为现代机器人学的关键。虽然市场上已有多种昂贵的灵巧手，但硬件设计的进步使得开发低成本开源灵巧手成为可能。大多数灵巧手采用拟人化设计以使用标准工具，但增加灵巧性通常需要牺牲拟人化程度。

Abstract: The rapid increase in the development of humanoid robots and customized
manufacturing solutions has brought dexterous manipulation to the forefront of
modern robotics. Over the past decade, several expensive dexterous hands have
come to market, but advances in hardware design, particularly in servo motors
and 3D printing, have recently facilitated an explosion of cheaper open-source
hands. Most hands are anthropomorphic to allow use of standard human tools, and
attempts to increase dexterity often sacrifice anthropomorphism. We introduce
the open-source ISyHand (pronounced easy-hand), a highly dexterous, low-cost,
easy-to-manufacture, on-joint servo-driven robot hand. Our hand uses
off-the-shelf Dynamixel motors, fasteners, and 3D-printed parts, can be
assembled within four hours, and has a total material cost of about 1,300 USD.
The ISyHands's unique articulated-palm design increases overall dexterity with
only a modest sacrifice in anthropomorphism. To demonstrate the utility of the
articulated palm, we use reinforcement learning in simulation to train the hand
to perform a classical in-hand manipulation task: cube reorientation. Our
novel, systematic experiments show that the simulated ISyHand outperforms the
two most comparable hands in early training phases, that all three perform
similarly well after policy convergence, and that the ISyHand significantly
outperforms a fixed-palm version of its own design. Additionally, we deploy a
policy trained on cube reorientation on the real hand, demonstrating its
ability to perform real-world dexterous manipulation.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution states in robot manipulation often lead to unpredictable
robot behavior or task failure, limiting success rates and increasing risk of
damage. Anomaly detection (AD) can identify deviations from expected patterns
in data, which can be used to trigger failsafe behaviors and recovery
strategies. Prior work has applied data-driven AD to time series data in
specific robotic tasks, but its transferability across control strategies and
task types has not been shown. Leveraging time series data, such as
force/torque signals, allows to directly capture robot-environment
interactions, crucial for manipulation and online failure detection. Their
broad availability, high sampling rates, and low dimensionality enable high
temporal resolution and efficient processing. As robotic tasks can have widely
signal characteristics and requirements, AD methods which can be applied in the
same way to a wide range of tasks is needed, ideally with good data efficiency.
We examine three industrial robotic tasks, each presenting several anomalies.
Test scenarios in robotic cabling, screwing, and sanding are built, and
multimodal time series data is gathered. Several autoencoder-based methods are
compared, evaluating generalization across tasks and control methods (diffusion
policy, position, and impedance control). This allows us to validate the
integration of AD in complex tasks involving tighter tolerances and variation
from both the robot and its environment. Additionally, we evaluate data
efficiency, detection latency, and task characteristics which support robust
detection. The results indicate reliable detection with AUROC exceeding 0.93 in
failures in the cabling and screwing task, such as incorrect or misaligned
parts and obstructed targets. In the polishing task, only severe failures were
reliably detected, while more subtle failure types remained undetected.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该论文提出了三种处理移动机器人环境建模不确定性的路径规划方法（PEH、GEH、GEGRH），通过在多个世界模型假设下进行规划，解决了障碍物识别不一致的问题。GEGRH方法在保持规划保守性的同时，实现了比VEH方法更低的轨迹成本和更快的规划时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动机器人在未知环境中运行时，由于传感器噪声和算法限制，障碍物识别可能不一致，导致规划系统难以生成安全运动。特别是当成本地图中的区域在连续规划周期内在障碍物和自由空间之间切换时，需要解决这种不确定性。

Method: 提出了三种迭代方法：PEH（为每个跨越分歧点的节点扩展调用子搜索）、GEH和GEGRH（将子搜索推迟到边扩展到目标区域后）。GEGRH还额外基于每个世界中的分歧节点修订图结构。

Result: PEH和GEH虽然比VEH找到更乐观的解，但规划时间超过1秒，不符合现场部署要求。GEGRH在非结构化越野环境测试中，相比VEH找到了成本更低的轨迹且平均规划时间更快。与单假设搜索相比，GEGRH生成更保守的规划，平均规划时间略有增加。

Conclusion: GEGRH方法通过处理环境建模的不确定性，在保持规划保守性的同时，实现了较好的轨迹质量和规划效率，适合移动机器人在未知环境中的实际部署。

Abstract: Mobile ground robots lacking prior knowledge of an environment must rely on
sensor data to develop a model of their surroundings. In these scenarios,
consistent identification of obstacles and terrain features can be difficult
due to noise and algorithmic shortcomings, which can make it difficult for
motion planning systems to generate safe motions. One particular difficulty to
overcome is when regions of the cost map switch between being marked as
obstacles and free space through successive planning cycles. One potential
solution to this, which we refer to as Valid in Every Hypothesis (VEH), is for
the planning system to plan motions that are guaranteed to be safe through a
history of world models. Another approach is to track a history of world
models, and adjust node costs according to the potential penalty of needing to
reroute around previously hazardous areas. This work discusses three major
iterations on this idea. The first iteration, called PEH, invokes a sub-search
for every node expansion that crosses through a divergence point in the world
models. The second and third iterations, called GEH and GEGRH respectively,
defer the sub-search until after an edge expands into the goal region. GEGRH
uses an additional step to revise the graph based on divergent nodes in each
world. Initial results showed that, although PEH and GEH find more optimistic
solutions than VEH, they are unable to generate solutions in less than
one-second, which exceeds our requirements for field deployment. Analysis of
results from a field experiment in an unstructured, off-road environment on a
Clearpath Robotics Warthog UGV indicate that GEGRH finds lower cost
trajectories and has faster average planning times than VEH. Compared to
single-hypothesis (SH) search, where only the latest world model is considered,
GEGRH generates more conservative plans with a small increase in average
planning time.

*Zichao Shen,Chen Gao,Jiaqi Yuan,Tianchen Zhu,Xingcheng Fu,Qingyun Sun*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SDA-PLANNER是一个用于具身任务规划的自适应规划器，通过状态依赖图和错误自适应重规划机制，解决了现有LLM规划器的固定范式、缺乏动作序列约束和错误不可知等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的具身任务规划方法存在三个局限：固定规划范式、缺乏动作序列约束、错误不可知。需要开发能够自适应规划、考虑状态依赖和错误处理的综合规划器。

Method: 提出SDA-PLANNER，引入状态依赖图显式建模动作前提条件和效果，指导动态修订；采用错误自适应重规划策略，包括错误回溯与诊断、自适应动作子树生成，基于当前环境状态局部重建受影响计划部分。

Result: 实验表明SDA-PLANNER在成功率和目标完成度上始终优于基线方法，特别是在各种错误条件下表现更佳。

Conclusion: SDA-PLANNER通过自适应规划范式、状态依赖感知和错误感知机制，实现了更全面的具身任务规划能力，显著提升了规划性能。

Abstract: Embodied task planning requires agents to produce executable actions in a
close-loop manner within the environment. With progressively improving
capabilities of LLMs in task decomposition, planning, and generalization,
current embodied task planning methods adopt LLM-based architecture.However,
existing LLM-based planners remain limited in three aspects, i.e., fixed
planning paradigms, lack of action sequence constraints, and error-agnostic. In
this work, we propose SDA-PLANNER, enabling an adaptive planning paradigm,
state-dependency aware and error-aware mechanisms for comprehensive embodied
task planning. Specifically, SDA-PLANNER introduces a State-Dependency Graph to
explicitly model action preconditions and effects, guiding the dynamic
revision. To handle execution error, it employs an error-adaptive replanning
strategy consisting of Error Backtrack and Diagnosis and Adaptive Action
SubTree Generation, which locally reconstructs the affected portion of the plan
based on the current environment state. Experiments demonstrate that
SDA-PLANNER consistently outperforms baselines in success rate and goal
completion, particularly under diverse error conditions.

TL;DR: 研究比较了在沉浸式机器人远程临场系统中解耦机器人旋转（unwinding rotations）与传统耦合旋转方法的效果，发现在使用真实全景相机时，解耦旋转能提高用户舒适度、减少VR晕动症，且不影响任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在沉浸式机器人远程临场系统中，机器人运动可能引发VR晕动症，降低用户体验。虽然先前研究表明解耦机器人旋转能提高舒适度，但该研究基于虚拟环境和模拟机器人，需要验证在真实相机流下的效果。

Method: 进行了用户研究（n=36），比较解耦旋转与耦合旋转方法。使用安装在机械臂上的全景相机完成任务，在涉及三维平移和旋转的检查任务中测试两种方法对用户表现的影响。

Result: 用户认为解耦旋转方法更舒适、更受欢迎，能够显著降低VR晕动症水平，且对任务表现没有显著影响。

Conclusion: 解耦机器人旋转的方法在真实相机流下同样有效，能够在减少VR晕动症的同时保持任务性能，是改善沉浸式远程临场体验的有效策略。

Abstract: Immersive telepresence, when a user views the video stream of a $360^\circ$
camera in a remote environment using a Head Mounted Display (HMD), has great
potential to improve the sense of being in a remote environment. In most cases
of immersive robotic telepresence, the camera is mounted on a mobile robot
which increases the portion of the environment that the remote user can
explore. However, robot motions can induce unpleasant symptoms associated with
Virtual Reality (VR) sickness, degrading the overall user experience. Previous
research has shown that unwinding the rotations of the robot, that is,
decoupling the rotations that the camera undergoes due to robot motions from
what is seen by the user, can increase user comfort and reduce VR sickness.
However, that work considered a virtual environment and a simulated robot. In
this work, to test whether the same hypotheses hold when the video stream from
a real camera is used, we carried out a user study $(n=36)$ in which the
unwinding rotations method was compared against coupled rotations in a task
completed through a panoramic camera mounted on a robotic arm. Furthermore,
within an inspection task which involved translations and rotations in three
dimensions, we tested whether unwinding the robot rotations impacted the
performance of users. The results show that the users found the unwinding
rotations method to be more comfortable and preferable, and that a reduced
level of VR sickness can be achieved without a significant impact on task
performance.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效执行集合非穿透约束的优化方法，适用于碰撞感知轨迹优化问题，通过可微条件和光滑半代数集近似来避免计算昂贵的非穿透约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于优化的方法在复杂任务中广泛使用，但大多数方法需要强制执行物体间的非穿透约束，这导致非平凡且计算昂贵的问题，限制了优化方法在规划和控制中的应用。

Method: 引入了具有解析表达式的可微条件来高效执行非穿透约束，并提出将多面体近似为光滑半代数集的方法来处理非光滑物体间的非碰撞问题。

Result: 通过多个数值实验验证了所提方法的性能，并与文献中其他基线方法进行了比较，展示了良好的效果。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效解决优化过程中的非穿透约束问题，为碰撞感知轨迹优化等应用提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Optimization-based methods are widely used for computing fast, diverse
solutions for complex tasks such as collision-free movement or planning in the
presence of contacts. However, most of these methods require enforcing
non-penetration constraints between objects, resulting in a non-trivial and
computationally expensive problem. This makes the use of optimization-based
methods for planning and control challenging. In this paper, we present a
method to efficiently enforce non-penetration of sets while performing
optimization over their configuration, which is directly applicable to problems
like collision-aware trajectory optimization. We introduce novel differentiable
conditions with analytic expressions to achieve this. To enforce non-collision
between non-smooth bodies using these conditions, we introduce a method to
approximate polytopes as smooth semi-algebraic sets. We present several
numerical experiments to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method and
compare the performance with other baseline methods recently proposed in the
literature.

TL;DR: 提出LfH-CP框架，通过幻觉关键点生成动态障碍物数据集，无需专家演示或试错探索，提高运动规划器的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成大规模多样的动态障碍物数据集具有挑战性，因为障碍物轨迹空间巨大。现有方法需要昂贵专家演示或试错探索。

Method: 将幻觉分解为两个阶段：首先识别关键点（障碍物必须出现的时间和位置），然后程序化生成通过这些点且避免碰撞的多样化轨迹。

Result: LfH-CP比现有基线方法产生更多样化的训练数据，在仿真实验中，基于LfH-CP数据集训练的运动规划器获得更高的成功率。

Conclusion: LfH-CP框架能有效生成丰富的动态障碍物数据集，避免生成失败如模式崩溃，确保覆盖多样的动态行为，提升运动规划性能。

Abstract: Generating large and diverse obstacle datasets to learn motion planning in
environments with dynamic obstacles is challenging due to the vast space of
possible obstacle trajectories. Inspired by hallucination-based data synthesis
approaches, we propose Learning from Hallucinating Critical Points (LfH-CP), a
self-supervised framework for creating rich dynamic obstacle datasets based on
existing optimal motion plans without requiring expensive expert demonstrations
or trial-and-error exploration. LfH-CP factorizes hallucination into two
stages: first identifying when and where obstacles must appear in order to
result in an optimal motion plan, i.e., the critical points, and then
procedurally generating diverse trajectories that pass through these points
while avoiding collisions. This factorization avoids generative failures such
as mode collapse and ensures coverage of diverse dynamic behaviors. We further
introduce a diversity metric to quantify dataset richness and show that LfH-CP
produces substantially more varied training data than existing baselines.
Experiments in simulation demonstrate that planners trained on LfH-CP datasets
achieves higher success rates compared to a prior hallucination method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于均值漂移的机器人群体形状组装方法使用图像表示目标形状，导致高内存开销，特别是在高分辨率或3D形状时变得不可行。

Method: 使用分层编码用户指定形状的树形图表示，设计基于行为的分布式控制器，实现无分配的形状组装。

Result: 与最先进均值漂移算法相比，内存使用降低1-2个数量级，形状进入速度快2-3倍，同时保持相当的均匀性。物理实验验证了实际可行性。

Conclusion: 所提出的树形图表示方法在2D和3D场景中都能有效解决内存效率问题，为机器人群体形状组装提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Mean-shift-based approaches have recently emerged as the most effective
methods for robot swarm shape assembly tasks. These methods rely on image-based
representations of target shapes to compute local density gradients and perform
mean-shift exploration, which constitute their core mechanism. However, such
image representations incur substantial memory overhead, which can become
prohibitive for high-resolution or 3D shapes. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a memory-efficient tree map representation that hierarchically encodes
user-specified shapes and is applicable to both 2D and 3D scenarios. Building
on this representation, we design a behavior-based distributed controller that
enables assignment-free shape assembly. Comparative 2D and 3D simulations
against a state-of-the-art mean-shift algorithm demonstrate one to two orders
of magnitude lower memory usage and two to three times faster shape entry while
maintaining comparable uniformity. Finally, we validate the framework through
physical experiments with 6 to 7 UAVs, confirming its real-world practicality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用UWB和雷达技术在恶劣环境和杂乱环境中的鲁棒性，开发低成本的多机器人相对定位系统。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：第一阶段使用非线性优化框架进行UWB三边定位和雷达预处理；第二阶段将预处理数据输入到位姿图优化框架中，结合里程计和机器人间约束。

Result: 系统在SITL仿真和真实数据集上验证，优于现有闭式方法，对噪声更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 提出的相对定位模块性能优越，因子图公式易于扩展到完整SLAM，所有代码和数据已公开以支持可重复性。

Abstract: Radio-based methods such as Ultra-Wideband (UWB) and RAdio Detection And
Ranging (radar), which have traditionally seen limited adoption in robotics,
are experiencing a boost in popularity thanks to their robustness to harsh
environmental conditions and cluttered environments. This work proposes a
multi-robot UGV-UAV localization system that leverages the two technologies
with inexpensive and readily-available sensors, such as Inertial Measurement
Units (IMUs) and wheel encoders, to estimate the relative position of an aerial
robot with respect to a ground robot. The first stage of the system pipeline
includes a nonlinear optimization framework to trilaterate the location of the
aerial platform based on UWB range data, and a radar pre-processing module with
loosely coupled ego-motion estimation which has been adapted for a multi-robot
scenario. Then, the pre-processed radar data as well as the relative
transformation are fed to a pose-graph optimization framework with odometry and
inter-robot constraints. The system, implemented for the Robotic Operating
System (ROS 2) with the Ceres optimizer, has been validated in
Software-in-the-Loop (SITL) simulations and in a real-world dataset. The
proposed relative localization module outperforms state-of-the-art closed-form
methods which are less robust to noise. Our SITL environment includes a custom
Gazebo plugin for generating realistic UWB measurements modeled after real
data. Conveniently, the proposed factor graph formulation makes the system
readily extensible to full Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM).
Finally, all the code and experimental data is publicly available to support
reproducibility and to serve as a common open dataset for benchmarking.

Motivation: 开发一个通用的GPU加速非线性图优化框架，使实时应用（如SLAM系统）能够与其优化任务共享代码，同时减少内存使用并提高性能。

Method: 提供CUDA C++接口，支持原地优化、多种浮点类型和混合精度模式、动态计算雅可比矩阵等内存优化技术。

Conclusion: Graphite能够在桌面和资源受限设备上实现更快的大规模优化，为实时应用提供了高效的GPU加速优化解决方案。

Abstract: We present Graphite, a GPU-accelerated nonlinear graph optimization

in-place optimization, support for multiple floating point types and
mixed-precision modes, and dynamically computed Jacobians. We evaluate Graphite
on well-known bundle adjustment problems and find that it achieves similar
performance to MegBA, a solver specialized for bundle adjustment, while
maintaining generality and using less memory. We also apply Graphite to global
visual-inertial bundle adjustment on maps generated from stereo-inertial SLAM
datasets, and observe speed ups of up to 59x compared to a CPU baseline. Our
results indicate that our solver enables faster large-scale optimization on
both desktop and resource-constrained devices.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种多感官语言-动作（MLA）模型，通过协同感知异构感官模态并预测未来多感官目标来增强机器人对物理世界的建模能力，在复杂接触丰富的任务中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉-语言-动作模型主要关注视觉和语言理解来生成动作，但机器人需要在空间物理世界中感知和交互，这凸显了对机器人特定多感官信息全面理解的需求，这对于实现复杂和接触丰富的控制至关重要。

Method: 1）提出无编码器的多模态对齐方案，将大语言模型重新用作感知模块，通过位置对应直接解释2D图像、3D点云和触觉标记；2）设计未来多感官生成后训练策略，使MLA能够推理语义、几何和交互信息。

Result: MLA模型在复杂、接触丰富的真实世界任务中，分别比之前最先进的2D和3D VLA方法提高了12%和24%，同时在未见配置上也表现出更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MLA模型通过多感官感知和未来目标预测，显著提升了机器人在物理世界中的建模和控制能力，为接触丰富的机器人操作任务提供了更强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language-action models (VLAs) have shown generalization capabilities
in robotic manipulation tasks by inheriting from vision-language models (VLMs)
and learning action generation. Most VLA models focus on interpreting vision
and language to generate actions, whereas robots must perceive and interact
within the spatial-physical world. This gap highlights the need for a
comprehensive understanding of robotic-specific multisensory information, which
is crucial for achieving complex and contact-rich control. To this end, we
introduce a multisensory language-action (MLA) model that collaboratively
perceives heterogeneous sensory modalities and predicts future multisensory
objectives to facilitate physical world modeling. Specifically, to enhance
perceptual representations, we propose an encoder-free multimodal alignment
scheme that innovatively repurposes the large language model itself as a
perception module, directly interpreting multimodal cues by aligning 2D images,
3D point clouds, and tactile tokens through positional correspondence. To
further enhance MLA's understanding of physical dynamics, we design a future
multisensory generation post-training strategy that enables MLA to reason about
semantic, geometric, and interaction information, providing more robust
conditions for action generation. For evaluation, the MLA model outperforms the
previous state-of-the-art 2D and 3D VLA methods by 12% and 24% in complex,
contact-rich real-world tasks, respectively, while also demonstrating improved
generalization to unseen configurations. Project website:

Motivation: 平衡传播作为生物可信的反向传播替代算法，之前仅限于密集层或小型卷积网络，与类似规模前馈网络相比准确率差距较大。

Method: 在Hopfield网络中引入残差连接，使用clipped ReLU激活函数，构建Hopfield-Resnet架构，支持训练更深层网络。

Result: Hopfield-Resnet13在CIFAR-10上达到93.92%准确率，比之前最佳结果提高约3.5%，与使用反向传播的Resnet13性能相当。

Conclusion: 通过架构改进，平衡传播算法能够训练更深层网络，性能接近反向传播，为在神经形态硬件上实现生物可信深度学习提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Equilibrium propagation has been proposed as a biologically plausible
alternative to the backpropagation algorithm. The local nature of gradient
computations, combined with the use of convergent RNNs to reach equilibrium
states, make this approach well-suited for implementation on neuromorphic
hardware. However, previous studies on equilibrium propagation have been
restricted to networks containing only dense layers or relatively small
architectures with a few convolutional layers followed by a final dense layer.
These networks have a significant gap in accuracy compared to similarly sized
feedforward networks trained with backpropagation. In this work, we introduce
the Hopfield-Resnet architecture, which incorporates residual (or skip)
connections in Hopfield networks with clipped $\mathrm{ReLU}$ as the activation
function. The proposed architectural enhancements enable the training of
networks with nearly twice the number of layers reported in prior works. For
example, Hopfield-Resnet13 achieves 93.92\% accuracy on CIFAR-10, which is
$\approx$3.5\% higher than the previous best result and comparable to that
provided by Resnet13 trained using backpropagation.

Motivation: 受计算系统与大脑关系的启发，旨在解决机器学习在通用推理模型路径上的主要障碍——时间泛化问题，同时结合生物神经网络的优势。

Method: 基于n个局部交互神经元粒子的无标度生物启发网络架构，采用GPU友好的图模型表示，具有Hebbian学习和脉冲神经元的工作记忆机制。

Result: 在语言和翻译任务上达到与GPT2相当的性能（10M到1B参数），具有Transformer类似的缩放规律，同时证明了个体突触在特定概念处理时的连接强化。

Conclusion: BDH是一种实用的、性能优越的注意力状态空间序列学习架构，具有内在可解释性、生物合理性和Transformer级别的性能表现。

Abstract: The relationship between computing systems and the brain has served as
motivation for pioneering theoreticians since John von Neumann and Alan Turing.
Uniform, scale-free biological networks, such as the brain, have powerful
properties, including generalizing over time, which is the main barrier for
Machine Learning on the path to Universal Reasoning Models.
  We introduce `Dragon Hatchling' (BDH), a new Large Language Model
architecture based on a scale-free biologically inspired network of \$n\$
locally-interacting neuron particles. BDH couples strong theoretical
foundations and inherent interpretability without sacrificing Transformer-like
performance.
  BDH is a practical, performant state-of-the-art attention-based state space
sequence learning architecture. In addition to being a graph model, BDH admits
a GPU-friendly formulation. It exhibits Transformer-like scaling laws:
empirically BDH rivals GPT2 performance on language and translation tasks, at
the same number of parameters (10M to 1B), for the same training data.
  BDH can be represented as a brain model. The working memory of BDH during
inference entirely relies on synaptic plasticity with Hebbian learning using
spiking neurons. We confirm empirically that specific, individual synapses
strengthen connection whenever BDH hears or reasons about a specific concept
while processing language inputs. The neuron interaction network of BDH is a
graph of high modularity with heavy-tailed degree distribution. The BDH model
is biologically plausible, explaining one possible mechanism which human
neurons could use to achieve speech.
  BDH is designed for interpretability. Activation vectors of BDH are sparse
and positive. We demonstrate monosemanticity in BDH on language tasks.
Interpretability of state, which goes beyond interpretability of neurons and
model parameters, is an inherent feature of the BDH architecture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调查不同培训方式对驾驶员安全使用自适应巡航控制(ACC)和车道保持辅助(LKA)系统的影响，解决车主手册描述不一致的问题。

Method: 比较三种培训格式：车主手册、知识型培训(含操作指南和视觉辅助)、模拟器实践培训，36名无经验参与者随机分组测试。

Result: 知识型培训在系统限制理解和安全使用模式方面改善最大，参与者测试得分更高，使用频率更高，且更清楚何时需要手动控制。

Conclusion: 简短针对性培训能显著提升车辆自动化系统的安全有效使用，特别是对老年驾驶员，培训可作为减少人机不匹配的主动安全干预措施。

Abstract: This study investigates how targeted training interventions can improve safe
driver interaction with vehicle automation (VA) systems, focusing on Adaptive
Cruise Control (ACC) and Lane Keeping Assist (LKA), both safety-critical
advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). Effective training reduces misuse
and enhances road safety by promoting correct knowledge and application.
  A review of multiple automakers' owners' manuals revealed inconsistencies in
describing ACC and LKA functions. Three training formats were compared: (1)
owners' manual (OM), (2) knowledge-based (KB) with summarized operational
guidelines and visual aids, and (3) skill-based hands-on practice in a driving
simulator (SIM). Thirty-six participants with no prior VA experience were
randomly assigned to one group. Safety-relevant outcomes - system comprehension
(quiz scores) and real-world engagement (frequency and duration of activations)
- were analyzed using mixed-effects and negative binomial models.
  KB training produced the greatest improvements in comprehension of system
limitations, as well as safer engagement patterns. Compared with OM
participants, KB participants achieved significantly higher quiz scores and
engaged LKA and ACC more often (1.4 and 1.45 times, respectively); they also
demonstrated greater awareness of scenarios requiring manual control,
indicating reduced risk of inappropriate reliance. Older drivers exhibited
longer activations overall, highlighting age-related differences in reliance
and potential safety implications.
  Short, targeted training can significantly improve safe and effective VA
system use, particularly for senior drivers. These results highlight training
as a proactive safety intervention to reduce human-automation mismatch and
enhance system reliability in real-world driving.

Abstract: As wearable technologies continue to evolve-becoming smaller, more powerful,
and more deeply embedded in daily life-their integration into diverse user
contexts raises critical design challenges. There remains a notable gap in
large-scale empirical data on where users actually wear or carry these devices
throughout the day, systematically examining user preferences for wearable
placement across varied contexts and routines. In this work, we conducted a
questionnaire in several countries aimed at capturing real-world habits related
to wearable device placement. The results from n = 320 participants reveal how
wearable usage patterns shift depending on time of day and context. We propose
a set of practical, user-centered guidelines for sensor placement and discuss
how they align or diverge from assumptions seen in existing ISWC work. This
study contributes to ongoing efforts within the community to design more
inclusive, adaptable, and context-aware wearable systems.

Abstract: The way residents perceive safety plays an important role in how they use
public spaces. Studies have combined large-scale street view images and
advanced computer vision techniques to measure the perception of safety of
urban environments. Despite their success, such studies have often overlooked
the specific environmental visual factors that draw human attention and trigger
people's feelings of safety perceptions. In this study, we introduce a
computational framework that enriches the existing body of literature on place
perception by using eye-tracking systems with street view images and deep
learning approaches. Eye-tracking systems quantify not only what users are
looking at but also how long they engage with specific environmental elements.
This allows us to explore the nuance of which visual environmental factors
influence human safety perceptions. We conducted our research in Helsingborg,
Sweden, where we recruited volunteers outfitted with eye-tracking systems. They
were asked to indicate which of the two street view images appeared safer. By
examining participants' focus on specific features using Mean Object Ratio in
Highlighted Regions (MoRH) and Mean Object Hue (MoH), we identified key visual
elements that attract human attention when perceiving safe environments. For
instance, certain urban infrastructure and public space features draw more
human attention while the sky is less relevant in influencing safety
perceptions. These insights offer a more human-centered understanding of which
urban features influence human safety perceptions. Furthermore, we compared the

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 该论文研究了残疾人停车位的质量和使用情况，通过访谈研究了解残疾人需求，并开发了AccessParkCV深度学习管道来自动检测和分析残疾人停车位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 残疾人停车位对残疾人群体至关重要，但美国缺乏大规模的质量调查和残疾人视角的研究，需要了解残疾人停车位的使用情况和质量特征。

Method: 首先进行11名残疾人的半结构化访谈研究，然后开发AccessParkCV深度学习管道，利用正射校正航空影像自动检测残疾人停车位并推断质量特征（如宽度）。

Result: 访谈发现残疾人会根据个人移动需求适应停车挑战，重视可靠实时的无障碍信息。AccessParkCV达到micro-F1=0.89，能够支持新的城市分析和终端用户工具。

Conclusion: 论文贡献包括对残疾人停车位的新定性理解、新颖的检测管道和开放数据集，以及未来工具的设计指南。

Abstract: Accessible parking is critical for people with disabilities (PwDs), allowing
equitable access to destinations, independent mobility, and community
participation. Despite mandates, there has been no large-scale investigation of
the quality or allocation of disability parking in the US nor significant
research on PwD perspectives and uses of disability parking. In this paper, we
first present a semi-structured interview study with 11 PwDs to advance
understanding of disability parking uses, concerns, and relevant technology
tools. We find that PwDs often adapt to disability parking challenges according
to their personal mobility needs and value reliable, real-time accessibility
information. Informed by these findings, we then introduce a new deep learning
pipeline, called AccessParkCV, and parking dataset for automatically detecting
disability parking and inferring quality characteristics (e.g., width) from
orthorectified aerial imagery. We achieve a micro-F1=0.89 and demonstrate how
our pipeline can support new urban analytics and end-user tools. Together, we
contribute new qualitative understandings of disability parking, a novel
detection pipeline and open dataset, and design guidelines for future tools.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文研究使用大语言模型作为新闻监控的首轮过滤器，通过编码新闻价值标准来提取和评估潜在新闻线索，在真实监控系统中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 记者面临监控日益扩大的数字信息流以识别有新闻价值内容的挑战，传统自动化工具缺乏编辑判断能力来评估新闻价值。

Method: 开发基于提示的方法，将新闻价值标准（时效性、影响力、争议性、普适性）编码到LLM指令中，用于提取和评估潜在新闻线索，并在真实监控管道中部署验证。

Result: 在从源材料提取相关线索方面表现优异（F1=0.94），粗略新闻价值评估准确率高达92%，但在需要领域专业知识的细致编辑判断方面仍有困难。

Conclusion: 该系统作为结合自动化监控与人工审查的混合工具最有价值，成功筛选出新颖高价值的线索同时过滤明显噪音，提出了将LLM驱动的监控整合到新闻工作流程的实际建议。

Abstract: Journalists face mounting challenges in monitoring ever-expanding digital
information streams to identify newsworthy content. While traditional
automation tools gather information at scale, they struggle with the editorial
judgment needed to assess newsworthiness. This paper investigates whether large
language models (LLMs) can serve as effective first-pass filters for
journalistic monitoring. We develop a prompt-based approach encoding
journalistic news values - timeliness, impact, controversy, and
generalizability - into LLM instructions to extract and evaluate potential
story leads. We validate our approach across multiple models against
expert-annotated ground truth, then deploy a real-world monitoring pipeline
that processes trade press articles daily. Our evaluation reveals strong
performance in extracting relevant leads from source material ($F1=0.94$) and
in coarse newsworthiness assessment ($\pm$1 accuracy up to 92%), but it
consistently struggles with nuanced editorial judgments requiring beat
expertise. The system proves most valuable as a hybrid tool combining automated
monitoring with human review, successfully surfacing novel, high-value leads
while filtering obvious noise. We conclude with practical recommendations for
integrating LLM-powered monitoring into newsroom workflows that preserves
editorial judgment while extending journalistic capacity.

TL;DR: Botender是一个让社区集体设计LLM驱动机器人的系统，无需编程即可协作定制机器人行为，通过基于案例的激发来测试和迭代机器人行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI机器人通常由外部人员或少数技术成员设计，可能不符合社区广泛需求，需要让社区集体参与机器人行为设计。

Method: 开发Botender系统，允许社区成员直接提议、迭代和部署定制机器人行为，使用基于案例的激发（交互场景）来促进用户反思和讨论。

Result: 验证研究发现基于案例的激发比标准测试用例更能揭示改进机会和分歧；在6个Discord服务器5天部署中，成功支持社区根据特定需求定制机器人行为。

Conclusion: Botender展示了基于案例的激发在促进协作机器人设计中的有效性，使社区能够集体塑造符合自身需求的机器人行为。

Abstract: AI agents, or bots, serve important roles in online communities. However,
they are often designed by outsiders or a few tech-savvy members, leading to
bots that may not align with the broader community's needs. How might
communities collectively shape the behavior of community bots? We present
Botender, a system that enables communities to collaboratively design
LLM-powered bots without coding. With Botender, community members can directly
propose, iterate on, and deploy custom bot behaviors tailored to community
needs. Botender facilitates testing and iteration on bot behavior through
case-based provocations: interaction scenarios generated to spark user
reflection and discussion around desirable bot behavior. A validation study
found these provocations more useful than standard test cases for revealing
improvement opportunities and surfacing disagreements. During a five-day
deployment across six Discord servers, Botender supported communities in
tailoring bot behavior to their specific needs, showcasing the usefulness of
case-based provocations in facilitating collaborative bot design.

Abstract: Human-AI interaction researchers face an overwhelming challenge: synthesizing
insights from thousands of empirical studies to understand how AI impacts
people and inform effective design. Existing approach for literature reviews
cluster papers by similarities, keywords or citations, missing the crucial
cause-and-effect relationships that reveal how design decisions impact user
outcomes. We introduce the Atlas of Human-AI Interaction, an interactive web
interface that provides the first systematic mapping of empirical findings
across 1,000+ HCI papers using LLM-powered knowledge extraction. Our approach
identifies causal relationships, and visualizes them through an AI-enabled
interactive web interface as a navigable knowledge graph. We extracted 2,037
empirical findings, revealing research topic clusters, common themes, and
disconnected areas. Expert evaluation with 20 researchers revealed the system's
effectiveness for discovering research gaps. This work demonstrates how AI can
transform literature synthesis itself, offering a scalable framework for
evidence-based design, opening new possibilities for computational meta-science
across HCI and beyond.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI和XR领域生态系统存在显著差距：AI研究有成熟框架加速，而构建AI驱动的XR交互原型仍需要手动集成感知、渲染和交互等底层系统，过程繁琐。

Method: 设计跨平台框架XR Blocks，提供模块化架构和即插即用组件，核心抽象包括用户、世界、对等体；接口、上下文和代理。基于WebXR、three.js、TensorFlow、Gemini等技术构建。

Result: 开发了开源模板、示例和高级演示，展示了框架的实用性，使社区能够快速从概念转向交互式XR原型。

Conclusion: XR Blocks通过降低开发摩擦，有效加速了AI+XR应用的快速原型开发，推动了这两个领域的融合创新。

Abstract: We are on the cusp where Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Extended Reality
(XR) are converging to unlock new paradigms of interactive computing. However,
a significant gap exists between the ecosystems of these two fields: while AI
research and development is accelerated by mature frameworks like JAX and
benchmarks like LMArena, prototyping novel AI-driven XR interactions remains a
high-friction process, often requiring practitioners to manually integrate
disparate, low-level systems for perception, rendering, and interaction. To
bridge this gap, we present XR Blocks, a cross-platform framework designed to
accelerate human-centered AI + XR innovation. XR Blocks strives to provide a
modular architecture with plug-and-play components for core abstraction in AI +
XR: user, world, peers; interface, context, and agents. Crucially, it is
designed with the mission of "reducing frictions from idea to reality", thus
accelerating rapid prototyping of AI + XR apps. Built upon accessible
technologies (WebXR, three.js, TensorFlow, Gemini), our toolkit lowers the
barrier to entry for XR creators. We demonstrate its utility through a set of
open-source templates, samples, and advanced demos, empowering the community to
quickly move from concept to interactive XR prototype. Site:

TL;DR: 研究发现用户在使用ChatGPT进行对话式信息搜索时存在数字鸿沟，只有19.1%的用户使用提示策略，且这些用户多为高学历和民主党倾向者。ChatGPT对争议性话题的回应表现出更高的认知复杂度和更多外部引用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解普通用户如何在实际对话式信息搜索中提示ChatGPT，以及ChatGPT如何适应性地回应，特别是在争议性和非争议性话题上的差异。

Method: 使用具有全国代表性的937名美国成年人样本，在科学、健康和政策背景下与ChatGPT进行多轮对话式信息搜索，分析用户提示策略和ChatGPT的沟通风格。

Result: 发现数字鸿沟的行为信号：只有少数用户使用提示策略，且这些用户多为高学历和民主党倾向者。ChatGPT对争议性话题的回应包含更多认知复杂度和外部引用。认知复杂的回应被认为较不有利但产生更积极的议题相关态度。

Conclusion: 研究强调了用户提示行为的差异，并展示了用户提示和AI回应如何共同塑造与对话式AI的信息搜索体验。

Abstract: Conversational AI, such as ChatGPT, is increasingly used for information
seeking. However, little is known about how ordinary users actually prompt and
how ChatGPT adapts its responses in real-world conversational information
seeking (CIS). In this study, a nationally representative sample of 937 U.S.
adults engaged in multi-turn CIS with ChatGPT on both controversial and
non-controversial topics across science, health, and policy contexts. We
analyzed both user prompting strategies and the communication styles of ChatGPT
responses. The findings revealed behavioral signals of digital divide: only
19.1% of users employed prompting strategies, and these users were
disproportionately more educated and Democrat-leaning. Further, ChatGPT
demonstrated contextual adaptation: responses to controversial topics contain
more cognitive complexity and more external references than to
non-controversial topics. Notably, cognitively complex responses were perceived
as less favorable but produced more positive issue-relevant attitudes. This
study highlights disparities in user prompting behaviors and shows how user
prompts and AI responses together shape information-seeking with conversational
AI.

Motivation: 随着青少年越来越多地使用社交媒体获取健康信息，了解针对青少年的内容价值变得重要，但目前对这些视频如何惠及和吸引青少年观众知之甚少。

Method: 对44个YouTube视频和66,901条评论进行主题分析。

Result: 发现这些视频为青少年常见挑战提供各种建议，使用引人入胜的叙事来增强真实性，并通过评论培养以青少年为中心的社区。但少数视频也提供了可能有害的误导性建议。

Conclusion: 基于研究结果，讨论了创建适合青少年的社交媒体内容的设计启示，并建议社交媒体平台促进更健康、更安全的青少年体验。

Abstract: As teenagers increasingly turn to social media for health-related
information, understanding the values of teen-targeted content has become
important. Although videos on healthy lifestyles and self-improvement are
gaining popularity on social media platforms like YouTube, little is known
about how these videos benefit and engage with teenage viewers. To address
this, we conducted a thematic analysis of 44 YouTube videos and 66,901
comments. We found that these videos provide various advice on teenagers'
common challenges, use engaging narratives for authenticity, and foster
teen-centered communities through comments. However, a few videos also gave
misleading advice to adolescents that can be potentially harmful. Based on our
findings, we discuss design implications for creating relatable and intriguing
social media content for adolescents. Additionally, we suggest ways for social
media platforms to promote healthier and safer experiences for teenagers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探索实践音乐家如何在AI辅助创作过程中保持创意控制权，关注技术能力与艺术身份之间的张力。

Method: 采用为期四周的生态评估方法，研究基于音乐家技能的音乐变奏工具在创作环境中的功能表现，并进行定性访谈。

Result: 研究发现工具对音乐家能力的依赖（提供优质初始音乐输入、将片段转化为完整音乐想法）促进了过程和成果的所有权感。访谈进一步揭示了个人所有权的重要性。

Conclusion: 音乐AI应支持而非取代人类创造力，设计工具时需要保留音乐表达的人性化特质，强调个人所有权在创意过程中的核心地位。

Abstract: This paper investigates the importance of personal ownership in musical AI
design, examining how practising musicians can maintain creative control over
the compositional process. Through a four-week ecological evaluation, we
examined how a music variation tool, reliant on the skill of musicians,
functioned within a composition setting. Our findings demonstrate that the
dependence of the tool on the musician's ability, to provide a strong initial
musical input and to turn moments into complete musical ideas, promoted
ownership of both the process and artefact. Qualitative interviews further
revealed the importance of this personal ownership, highlighting tensions
between technological capability and artistic identity. These findings provide
insight into how musical AI can support rather than replace human creativity,
highlighting the importance of designing tools that preserve the humanness of
musical expression.

Conclusion: Dia-Lingle通过游戏化界面有效促进了方言数据的收集和标注，为方言计算资源稀缺问题提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Dialects suffer from the scarcity of computational textual resources as they
exist predominantly in spoken rather than written form and exhibit remarkable
geographical diversity. Collecting dialect data and subsequently integrating it
into current language technologies present significant obstacles. Gamification
has been proven to facilitate remote data collection processes with great ease
and on a substantially wider scale. This paper introduces Dia-Lingle, a
gamified interface aimed to improve and facilitate dialectal data collection
tasks such as corpus expansion and dialect labelling. The platform features two
key components: the first challenges users to rewrite sentences in their
dialects, identifies them through a classifier and solicits feedback, and the
other one asks users to match sentences to their geographical locations.
Dia-Lingle combines active learning with gamified difficulty levels,
strategically encouraging prolonged user engagement while efficiently enriching
the dialect corpus. Usability evaluation shows that our interface demonstrates
high levels of user satisfaction. We provide the link to Dia-Lingle:

Motivation: 编程新手在理解代码执行和形成抽象心理模型方面存在困难，特别是在背景、语言能力和经验差异大的大型入门课程中。

Method: 在12周的Python入门课程中部署交互式多表征可视化工具，结合同步代码视图、内存图和概念类比，与单一可视化和纯文本方法进行比较。

Result: 多表征方法比单一可视化和纯文本方法产生更高的参与度；纯文本组报告了更高的即时心智努力；早期高认知负荷与长期清晰度和帮助感降低相关；个体差异（语言能力和编程经验）调节了这些模式。

Conclusion: 通过整合多种外部表征并提供针对不同学习者特征的支架式支持，可以设计更有效支持编程新手学习的可视化工具。

Abstract: Novice programmers often struggle to understand how code executes and to form
the abstract mental models necessary for effective problem-solving, challenges
that are amplified in large, diverse introductory courses where students'
backgrounds, language proficiencies, and prior experiences vary widely. This
study examines whether interactive, multi-representational visualizations,
combining synchronized code views, memory diagrams, and conceptual analogies,
can help manage cognitive load and foster engagement more effectively than
single-visual or text-only approaches. Over a 12-week deployment in a
high-enrolment introductory Python course (N = 829), students who relied solely
on text-based explanations reported significantly higher immediate mental
effort than those using visual aids, although overall cognitive load did not
differ significantly among conditions. The multi-representational approach
consistently yielded higher engagement than both single-visual and text-only
methods. Usage logs indicated that learners' interaction patterns varied with
topic complexity, and predictive modelling suggested that early experiences of
high cognitive load were associated with lower longer-term perceptions of
clarity and helpfulness. Individual differences, including language proficiency
and prior programming experience, moderated these patterns. By integrating
multiple external representations with scaffolded support adapted to diverse
learner profiles, our findings highlight design considerations for creating
visualization tools that more effectively support novices learning to program.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户在使用功能丰富的工具（如Excel）时往往难以发现更高效的工作流程，现有AI助手需要用户主动描述目标或问题，这既费力又不精确。

Method: 采用两阶段处理流程：首先使用视觉语言模型从屏幕录像中重建用户操作和上下文，然后使用语言模型生成结构化的高质量建议。

Result: 评估显示InvisibleMentor能准确识别低效工作流程，参与者认为其建议比基于提示的电子表格助手更具操作性、更个性化，对学习和改进更有帮助。

Conclusion: 基于屏幕录像的方法能够有效检测用户工作流中的低效问题并提供针对性建议，相比传统方法具有显著优势。

Abstract: Many users struggle to notice when a more efficient workflow exists in
feature-rich tools like Excel. Existing AI assistants offer help only after
users describe their goals or problems, which can be effortful and imprecise.
We present InvisibleMentor, a system that turns screen recordings of task
completion into vision-grounded reflections on tasks. It detects issues such as
repetitive edits and recommends more efficient alternatives based on observed
behavior. Unlike prior systems that rely on logs, APIs, or user prompts,
InvisibleMentor operates directly on screen recordings. It uses a two-stage
pipeline: a vision-language model reconstructs actions and context, and a
language model generates structured, high-fidelity suggestions. In evaluation,
InvisibleMentor accurately identified inefficient workflows, and participants
found its suggestions more actionable, tailored, and more helpful for learning
and improvement compared to a prompt-based spreadsheet assistant.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型作为长期虚拟教练的潜力，特别是在跑步训练领域，目前这方面的研究尚不充分。

Method: 采用为期两个月的单案例研究，基于文本交互和消费级应用日志，LLM担任规划者、解释者和偶尔的激励者角色。

Result: 受试者表现从持续跑2公里（配速7分54秒/公里）提升到完成21.1公里半程马拉松（配速6分30秒/公里），在步频、配速心率耦合和效率指数方面均有改善。

Conclusion: 研究证明了LLM作为虚拟教练的安全性和有效性，但存在实时传感器集成、个性化等局限，提出了下一代系统需要持久运动员模型、多模态传感、主动激励等设计需求。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as everyday assistants, but their
role as longitudinal virtual coaches is underexplored. This two-month single
subject case study documents LLM guided half marathon preparation
(July-September 2025). Using text based interactions and consumer app logs, the
LLM acted as planner, explainer, and occasional motivator. Performance improved
from sustaining 2 km at 7min 54sec per km to completing 21.1 km at 6min 30sec
per km, with gains in cadence, pace HR coupling, and efficiency index trends.
While causal attribution is limited without a control, outcomes demonstrate
safe, measurable progress. At the same time, gaps were evident, no realtime
sensor integration, text only feedback, motivation support that was user
initiated, and limited personalization or safety guardrails. We propose design
requirements for next generation systems, persistent athlete models with
explicit guardrails, multimodal on device sensing, audio, haptic, visual
feedback, proactive motivation scaffolds, and privacy-preserving
personalization. This study offers grounded evidence and a design agenda for
evolving LLMs from retrospective advisors to closed-loop coaching companions.

Motivation: 现有的桥模型通常局限于单一任务或小规模数据集，通用语音恢复能力受限。本文旨在开发一个能够处理各种失真并重建高保真语音的通用语音恢复系统。

Method: 使用能量保持变分自编码器压缩语音波形为连续潜在表示，通过潜在桥模型进行单一潜在到潜在生成过程，采用联合神经先验减轻重建负担，并设计了感知感知的微调阶段。

Result: 在领域内和领域外任务及数据集上的广泛验证表明，VoiceBridge在通用语音恢复方面表现出优越性能，能够改进最近的零样本语音和播客生成结果。

Conclusion: VoiceBridge通过潜在桥模型、能量保持编码器和感知感知微调等创新方法，成功实现了从各种失真中重建高保真语音的通用语音恢复能力。

Abstract: Bridge models have recently been explored for speech enhancement tasks such
as denoising, dereverberation, and super-resolution, while these efforts are
typically confined to a single task or small-scale datasets, with constrained
general speech restoration (GSR) capability at scale. In this work, we
introduce VoiceBridge, a GSR system rooted in latent bridge models (LBMs),
capable of reconstructing high-fidelity speech at full-band (\textit{i.e.,}
48~kHz) from various distortions. By compressing speech waveform into
continuous latent representations, VoiceBridge models the~\textit{diverse
LQ-to-HQ tasks} (namely, low-quality to high-quality) in GSR with~\textit{a
single latent-to-latent generative process} backed by a scalable transformer
architecture. To better inherit the advantages of bridge models from the data
domain to the latent space, we present an energy-preserving variational
autoencoder, enhancing the alignment between the waveform and latent space over
varying energy levels. Furthermore, to address the difficulty of HQ
reconstruction from distinctively different LQ priors, we propose a joint
neural prior, uniformly alleviating the reconstruction burden of LBM. At last,
considering the key requirement of GSR systems, human perceptual quality, a
perceptually aware fine-tuning stage is designed to mitigate the cascading
mismatch in generation while improving perceptual alignment. Extensive
validation across in-domain and out-of-domain tasks and datasets
(\textit{e.g.}, refining recent zero-shot speech and podcast generation
results) demonstrates the superior performance of VoiceBridge. Demo samples can

Abstract: This paper presents the first step in a research project situated within the
field of musical agents. The objective is to achieve, through training, the
tuning of the desired musical relationship between a live musical input and a
real-time generated musical output, through the curation of a database of
separated tracks. We propose an architecture integrating a symbolic decision
module capable of learning and exploiting musical relationships from such
musical corpus. We detail an offline implementation of this architecture
employing Transformers as the decision module, associated with a perception
module based on Wav2Vec 2.0, and concatenative synthesis as audio renderer. We
present a quantitative evaluation of the decision module's ability to reproduce
learned relationships extracted during training. We demonstrate that our
decision module can predict a coherent track B when conditioned by its
corresponding ''guide'' track A, based on a corpus of paired tracks (A, B).

### [198] [EMO-TTA: Improving Test-Time Adaptation of Audio-Language Models for Speech Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25495)
*Jiacheng Shi,Hongfei Du,Y. Alicia Hong,Ye Gao*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出Emo-TTA，一种轻量级、免训练的测试时适应框架，通过期望最大化过程增量更新类条件统计量，用于显式测试时分布估计，使用ALM预测作为先验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音情感识别中的音频-语言模型在测试时容易受到分布偏移的影响，导致在域外场景中性能下降。现有的测试时适应方法通常依赖基于梯度的更新或提示调优，限制了灵活性和实用性。

Method: Emo-TTA框架通过期望最大化过程增量更新类条件统计量，使用ALM预测作为先验进行显式测试时分布估计，无需修改模型权重，在单个测试样本上操作。

Result: 在六个域外SER基准测试上的实验表明，Emo-TTA相比先前的TTA基线方法在准确率上取得了持续改进。

Conclusion: Emo-TTA通过统计适应有效对齐模型预测与演变的测试分布，证明了统计适应在测试时适应中的有效性。

Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) with audio-language models (ALMs) remains
vulnerable to distribution shifts at test time, leading to performance
degradation in out-of-domain scenarios. Test-time adaptation (TTA) provides a
promising solution but often relies on gradient-based updates or prompt tuning,
limiting flexibility and practicality. We propose Emo-TTA, a lightweight,
training-free adaptation framework that incrementally updates class-conditional
statistics via an Expectation-Maximization procedure for explicit test-time
distribution estimation, using ALM predictions as priors. Emo-TTA operates on
individual test samples without modifying model weights. Experiments on six
out-of-domain SER benchmarks show consistent accuracy improvements over prior
TTA baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of statistical adaptation in
aligning model predictions with evolving test distributions.

*Kang Yang,Yifan Liang,Fangkun Liu,Zhenping Xie,Chengshi Zheng*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出LTA-L2S模型解决汉语唇语转语音的挑战，通过跨语言迁移学习和流匹配模型提升语音可懂度和声调准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 汉语唇语转语音面临复杂的视位-音位映射和声调对可懂度的关键影响，现有方法效果有限

Method: 采用跨语言迁移学习策略适配英语预训练模型，使用流匹配模型生成F0轮廓，并通过两阶段训练提升语音质量

Result: LTA-L2S在语音可懂度和声调准确性方面显著优于现有方法

Conclusion: 该模型成功解决了汉语唇语转语音的核心挑战，为跨语言语音合成提供了有效方案

Abstract: Lip-to-speech (L2S) synthesis for Mandarin is a significant challenge,
hindered by complex viseme-to-phoneme mappings and the critical role of lexical
tones in intelligibility. To address this issue, we propose Lexical Tone-Aware
Lip-to-Speech (LTA-L2S). To tackle viseme-to-phoneme complexity, our model
adapts an English pre-trained audio-visual self-supervised learning (SSL) model
via a cross-lingual transfer learning strategy. This strategy not only
transfers universal knowledge learned from extensive English data to the
Mandarin domain but also circumvents the prohibitive cost of training such a
model from scratch. To specifically model lexical tones and enhance
intelligibility, we further employ a flow-matching model to generate the F0
contour. This generation process is guided by ASR-fine-tuned SSL speech units,
which contain crucial suprasegmental information. The overall speech quality is
then elevated through a two-stage training paradigm, where a flow-matching
postnet refines the coarse spectrogram from the first stage. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that LTA-L2S significantly outperforms existing methods
in both speech intelligibility and tonal accuracy.

### [200] [HNote: Extending YNote with Hexadecimal Encoding for Fine-Tuning LLMs in Music Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25694)
*Hung-Ying Chu,Shao-Yu Wei,Guan-Wei Chen,Tzu-Wei Hung,ChengYang Tsai,Yu-Cheng Lin*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了HNote，一种基于十六进制的符号音乐表示法，扩展自YNote，将音高和时长编码在固定的32单元小节框架内，适合LLM架构，并在江南风格音乐生成中验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音乐格式如MIDI、ABC和MusicXML过于复杂或结构不一致，限制了基于token的学习架构的适用性，需要一种更适合LLM的音乐表示法。

Method: 扩展YNote提出HNote十六进制表示法，在固定32单元小节框架内编码音高和时长；将12,300首江南风格歌曲从YNote转换为HNote，使用LoRA对LLaMA-3.1(8B)进行参数高效微调。

Result: HNote实现了82.5%的语法正确率，BLEU和ROUGE评估显示强烈的符号和结构相似性，生成了风格一致的作曲。

Conclusion: HNote是整合LLM与文化音乐建模的有效框架，为符号音乐生成提供了合适的表示法。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have created new
opportunities for symbolic music generation. However, existing formats such as
MIDI, ABC, and MusicXML are either overly complex or structurally inconsistent,
limiting their suitability for token-based learning architectures. To address
these challenges, we propose HNote, a novel hexadecimal-based notation system
extended from YNote, which encodes both pitch and duration within a fixed
32-unit measure framework. This design ensures alignment, reduces ambiguity,
and is directly compatible with LLM architectures. We converted 12,300
Jiangnan-style songs generated from traditional folk pieces from YNote into
HNote, and fine-tuned LLaMA-3.1(8B) using parameter-efficient LoRA.
Experimental results show that HNote achieves a syntactic correctness rate of
82.5%, and BLEU and ROUGE evaluations demonstrate strong symbolic and
structural similarity, producing stylistically coherent compositions. This
study establishes HNote as an effective framework for integrating LLMs with
cultural music modeling.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: MARS框架将频谱图视为多通道图像，通过通道复用技术降低分辨率而不丢失信息，使用共享分词器提供跨尺度的离散表示，实现从粗到细的频谱图自回归生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频生成研究从波形方法转向频谱图方法，后者能更好地捕捉谐波和时间结构；同时图像合成研究表明跨尺度的自回归能提高连贯性和细节。

Method: 将频谱图视为多通道图像，使用通道复用技术降低高度和宽度，共享分词器提供一致的离散表示，基于transformer的自回归器从粗到细分辨率高效优化频谱图。

Result: 在大规模数据集上的实验表明，MARS在多个评估指标上达到或优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: MARS为高保真音频生成建立了一个高效且可扩展的范式。

Abstract: Research on audio generation has progressively shifted from waveform-based
approaches to spectrogram-based methods, which more naturally capture harmonic
and temporal structures. At the same time, advances in image synthesis have
shown that autoregression across scales, rather than tokens, improves coherence
and detail. Building on these ideas, we introduce MARS (Multi-channel
AutoRegression on Spectrograms), a framework that treats spectrograms as
multi-channel images and employs channel multiplexing (CMX), a reshaping
technique that lowers height and width without discarding information. A shared
tokenizer provides consistent discrete representations across scales, enabling
a transformer-based autoregressor to refine spectrograms from coarse to fine
resolutions efficiently. Experiments on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that
MARS performs comparably or better than state-of-the-art baselines across
multiple evaluation metrics, establishing an efficient and scalable paradigm
for high-fidelity audio generation.

*Subrata Biswas,Mohammad Nur Hossain Khan,Bashima Islam*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了SAGE几何感知音频编码器和OWL音频大语言模型，通过结合双耳音频与全景深度图像，实现了更高精度的空间方位和距离估计，在空间推理问答任务上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前音频大语言模型主要依赖非结构化的双耳线索和单步推理，限制了方向距离估计的感知精度和可解释推理能力。现有方法如BAT依赖粗粒度分类标签且缺乏显式几何监督。

Method: 开发了SAGE几何感知音频编码器，在训练时使用全景深度图像和房间脉冲响应将双耳声学特征与3D空间结构对齐，推理时仅需音频。在此基础上构建OWL模型，集成空间基础思维链进行多步推理。

Result: 在BiDepth和SpatialSoundQA两个基准数据集上，OWL通过SAGE将平均DoA误差减少11°，空间推理问答准确率比BAT提高25%。

Conclusion: 通过几何感知编码和空间基础思维链，OWL模型显著提升了音频空间感知和推理能力，为音频大语言模型的空间理解开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning is fundamental to auditory perception, yet current audio
large language models (ALLMs) largely rely on unstructured binaural cues and
single step inference. This limits both perceptual accuracy in direction and
distance estimation and the capacity for interpretable reasoning. Recent work
such as BAT demonstrates spatial QA with binaural audio, but its reliance on
coarse categorical labels (left, right, up, down) and the absence of explicit
geometric supervision constrain resolution and robustness. We introduce the
$\textbf{Spatial-Acoustic Geometry Encoder (SAGE}$), a geometry-aware audio
encoder that aligns binaural acoustic features with 3D spatial structure using
panoramic depth images and room-impulse responses at training time, while
requiring only audio at inference. Building on this representation, we present
$\textbf{OWL}$, an ALLM that integrates $\textbf{SAGE}$ with a spatially
grounded chain-of-thought to rationalize over direction-of-arrivals (DoA) and
distance estimates. Through curriculum learning from perceptual QA to
multi-step reasoning, $\textbf{OWL}$ supports o'clock-level azimuth and DoA
estimation. To enable large-scale training and evaluation, we construct and
release $\textbf{BiDepth}$, a dataset of over one million QA pairs combining
binaural audio with panoramic depth images and room impulse responses across
both in-room and out-of-room scenarios. Across two benchmark datasets, our new
$\textbf{BiDepth}$ and the public SpatialSoundQA, $\textbf{OWL}$ reduces mean
DoA error by $\textbf{11$^{\circ}$}$ through $\textbf{SAGE}$ and improves
spatial reasoning QA accuracy by up to $\textbf{25}$\% over BAT.

TL;DR: 本文评估了五种最先进的说话人日志模型在四个多语言数据集上的表现，发现PyannoteAI性能最佳（11.2% DER），DiariZen是优秀的开源替代方案（13.3% DER），主要错误源于漏检语音段和说话人混淆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 说话人日志是音频处理中的关键任务，但仍是未解决的问题。日志错误会传播到下游系统并导致广泛失败，因此需要分析具体失败模式。

Method: 评估五种最先进的说话人日志模型，在四个包含196.6小时多语言音频的数据集上进行测试，涵盖英语、普通话、德语、日语和西班牙语。

Result: PyannoteAI表现最佳（11.2% DER），DiariZen是优秀的开源替代方案（13.3% DER）。主要错误是漏检语音段，其次是说话人混淆，特别是在高说话人数量的场景中。

Conclusion: 说话人日志的主要挑战在于漏检语音段和说话人混淆，特别是在多说话人场景中。PyannoteAI和DiariZen是目前表现最好的解决方案。

Abstract: Speaker diarization is the task of partitioning audio into segments according
to speaker identity, answering the question of "who spoke when" in
multi-speaker conversation recordings. While diarization is an essential task
for many downstream applications, it remains an unsolved problem. Errors in
diarization propagate to downstream systems and cause wide-ranging failures. To
this end, we examine exact failure modes by evaluating five state-of-the-art
diarization models, across four diarization datasets spanning multiple
languages and acoustic conditions. The evaluation datasets consist of 196.6
hours of multilingual audio, including English, Mandarin, German, Japanese, and
Spanish. Overall, we find that PyannoteAI achieves the best performance at
11.2% DER, while DiariZen provides a competitive open-source alternative at
13.3% DER. When analyzing failure cases, we find that the primary cause of
diarization errors stem from missed speech segments followed by speaker
confusion, especially in high-speaker count settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型虽然在各领域表现优异，但注意力层需要大量参数和高端硬件进行训练和推理，计算成本高昂。

Method: 提出解耦注意力块中查询、键、值和输出投影矩阵四个层的剪枝，研究沿头部和通道维度的剪枝策略，比较不同剪枝场景下音频谱图Transformer模型的性能。

Result: 实验结果显示，即使剪枝50%的注意力参数，性能下降也小于1%。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效减少Transformer模型的参数数量和计算需求，同时保持高性能。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have become the state of the art across multiple
domains, from natural language processing to machine listening, thanks to
attention mechanisms. However, the attention layers require a large number of
parameters and high-end hardware for both training and inference. We propose a
novel pruning technique targeted explicitly at the attention mechanism, where
we decouple the pruning of the four layers in the attention block, namely:
query, keys, values and outputs' projection matrices. We also investigate
pruning strategies to prune along the head and channel dimensions, and compare
the performance of the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) model under
different pruning scenarios. Our results show that even by pruning 50\% of the
attention parameters we incur in performance degradation of less than 1\%

Abstract: Data quality issues such as off-topic samples, near duplicates, and label
errors often limit the performance of audio-based systems. This paper addresses
these issues by adapting SelfClean, a representation-to-rank data auditing
framework, from the image to the audio domain. This approach leverages
self-supervised audio representations to identify common data quality issues,
creating ranked review lists that surface distinct issues within a single,
unified process. The method is benchmarked on the ESC-50, GTZAN, and a
proprietary industrial dataset, using both synthetic and naturally occurring
corruptions. The results demonstrate that this framework achieves
state-of-the-art ranking performance, often outperforming issue-specific
baselines and enabling significant annotation savings by efficiently guiding
human review.

Conclusion: MUSE-Explainer能够为音乐图神经网络模型提供清晰、人类友好的解释，解决了现有方法产生不现实或混乱输出的问题。

Abstract: Interpretability is essential for deploying deep learning models in symbolic
music analysis, yet most research emphasizes model performance over
explanation. To address this, we introduce MUSE-Explainer, a new method that
helps reveal how music Graph Neural Network models make decisions by providing
clear, human-friendly explanations. Our approach generates counterfactual
explanations by making small, meaningful changes to musical score graphs that
alter a model's prediction while ensuring the results remain musically
coherent. Unlike existing methods, MUSE-Explainer tailors its explanations to
the structure of musical data and avoids unrealistic or confusing outputs. We
evaluate our method on a music analysis task and show it offers intuitive
insights that can be visualized with standard music tools such as Verovio.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效处理歌手数量变化的现实混合音频，在无伴奏合唱音乐分离任务中表现出色。

Abstract: In this work, we study the task of multi-singer separation in a cappella
music, where the number of active singers varies across mixtures. To address
this, we use a power set-based data augmentation strategy that expands limited
multi-singer datasets into exponentially more training samples. To separate
singers, we introduce SepACap, an adaptation of SepReformer, a state-of-the-art
speaker separation model architecture. We adapt the model with periodic
activations and a composite loss function that remains effective when stems are
silent, enabling robust detection and separation. Experiments on the JaCappella
dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in
both full-ensemble and subset singer separation scenarios, outperforming
spectrogram-based baselines while generalizing to realistic mixtures with
varying numbers of singers.

Abstract: Recently, machine learning has made a significant impact on de novo drug
design. However, current approaches to creating novel molecules conditioned on
a target protein typically rely on generating molecules directly in the 3D
conformational space, which are often slow and overly complex. In this work, we
propose SOLD (SELFIES-based Objective-driven Latent Diffusion), a novel latent
diffusion model that generates molecules in a latent space derived from 1D
SELFIES strings and conditioned on a target protein. In the process, we also
train an innovative SELFIES transformer and propose a new way to balance losses
when training multi-task machine learning models.Our model generates
high-affinity molecules for the target protein in a simple and efficient way,
while also leaving room for future improvements through the addition of more

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-assisted mobile crowdsensing (MCS) has
emerged as a promising paradigm for data collection. However, challenges such
as spectrum scarcity, device heterogeneity, and user mobility hinder efficient
coordination of sensing, communication, and computation. To tackle these
issues, we propose a joint optimization framework that integrates time slot
partition for sensing, communication, and computation phases, resource
allocation, and UAV 3D trajectory planning, aiming to maximize the amount of
processed sensing data. The problem is formulated as a non-convex stochastic
optimization and further modeled as a partially observable Markov decision
process (POMDP) that can be solved by multi-agent deep reinforcement learning
(MADRL) algorithm. To overcome the limitations of conventional multi-layer
perceptron (MLP) networks, we design a novel MADRL algorithm with hybrid actor
network. The newly developed method is based on heterogeneous agent proximal
policy optimization (HAPPO), empowered by convolutional neural networks (CNN)
for feature extraction and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN) to capture
structured state-action dependencies. Extensive numerical results demonstrate
that our proposed method achieves significant improvements in the amount of
processed sensing data when compared with other benchmarks.

Motivation: 传统拼图求解方法主要依赖视觉线索，但在具有侵蚀间隙的挑战性场景中缺乏语义指导。本文探索利用自然语言描述提供语义引导来增强拼图组装能力。

Method: 提出视觉-语言层次语义对齐(VLHSA)模块，通过多级语义匹配将视觉块与文本描述对齐，结合双视觉编码器和语言特征进行跨模态推理。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著优于最先进模型，实现了14.2个百分点的拼图块准确率提升。消融研究证实VLHSA模块对改进的关键作用。

Conclusion: 通过融入多模态语义洞察，为拼图求解建立了新范式，证明了语言语义指导在复杂拼图场景中的重要性。

Abstract: Jigsaw puzzle solving remains challenging in computer vision, requiring an
understanding of both local fragment details and global spatial relationships.
While most traditional approaches only focus on visual cues like edge matching
and visual coherence, few methods explore natural language descriptions for
semantic guidance in challenging scenarios, especially for eroded gap puzzles.
We propose a vision-language framework that leverages textual context to
enhance puzzle assembly performance. Our approach centers on the
Vision-Language Hierarchical Semantic Alignment (VLHSA) module, which aligns
visual patches with textual descriptions through multi-level semantic matching
from local tokens to global context. Also, a multimodal architecture that
combines dual visual encoders with language features for cross-modal reasoning
is integrated into this module. Experiments demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models across various datasets,
achieving substantial improvements, including a 14.2 percentage point gain in
piece accuracy. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of the VLHSA module
in driving improvements over vision-only approaches. Our work establishes a new
paradigm for jigsaw puzzle solving by incorporating multimodal semantic
insights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经符号应用中，隐马尔可夫模型等概率符号模型需要密集计算和数据传输，通信开销影响性能，需要有效的压缩方法。

Method: 采用归一化量化感知的期望最大化过程进行概率模型训练，实现线性量化压缩。

Result: Norm-Q相比传统量化方法实现更高压缩率且分数损失合理，在4096隐藏状态的HMM上可量化至8位无损失，最多3位可接受损失，权重压缩率达99%。

Conclusion: Norm-Q方法能有效压缩概率符号模型，缓解内存带宽压力，适合在定制硬件上部署。

Abstract: Hidden Markov models (HMM) are commonly used in generation tasks and have
demonstrated strong capabilities in neuro-symbolic applications for the Markov
property. These applications leverage the strengths of neural networks and
symbolic reasoning to create robust and interpretable AI systems. However, they
may inherit and amplify the shortcomings of both approaches. Both components
require dense computation and data transfer, and their communication further
hinders performance. This paper proposes Norm-Q, a normalized linear
quantization approach for compressing probabilistic symbolic models, such as
HMMs. We reduce the bit width of the data with minimal impact, thereby
alleviating memory and bandwidth stress and enabling deployment on potential
custom hardware. Our method introduces a normalized quantization-aware
expectation maximization process for probabilistic model training. The
experimental results show that Norm-Q achieves a higher compression rate with
reasonable score loss compared to traditional quantization methods. In the case
of the constrained generation task of large language models, we successfully
quantize an HMM of 4096 hidden states to 8 bits without loss and, at most, 3
bits with acceptable loss. Notably, the Norm-Q method can achieve a compression
rate of 99% for the weights of the HMM. The code is open source at

Result: 在多个公开基准测试中，SLS始终优于现有基线方法，在数学、编程和科学推理任务中实现了更优的准确性。

Conclusion: SLS是一种有效的轻量级推理时优化方法，能够锐化输出分布同时保持上下文一致性，显著提升LLM性能。

Abstract: Entropy-based inference methods have gained traction for improving the
reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, many existing approaches,
such as entropy minimization techniques, suffer from high computational
overhead and fail to leverage historical token context effectively. To address
these limitations, we propose Spectral Logit Sculpting (SLS), a lightweight
inference-time optimization method that dynamically modulates token
distributions using spectral and entropic properties of recent logits. SLS
maintains a sliding buffer of top-K logits, performs on-the-fly Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to identify dominant spectral directions, and adaptively
rescales logits based on both entropy and logit gap statistics--only activating
when uncertainty is high. Without updating any model parameters, SLS
effectively sharpens the output distribution while preserving contextual
consistency. Experimental results on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate
that SLS consistently outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving superior
accuracy in mathematical, coding, and scientific reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预算节奏控制方法依赖临时参数调整，存在不稳定和效率低的问题，需要更稳定和自适应的支出控制方案。

Method: 采用分桶滞后控制与比例反馈相结合的原理性控制器，提供了参数选择的框架和分析方法。

Result: 在真实拍卖环境中的实验显示，相比基线方法，节奏准确性和投放一致性显著提升，节奏误差减少13%，λ-波动性降低54%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过将控制理论与广告系统结合，为预算节奏控制提供了可扩展且可靠的解决方案，特别对小预算广告活动有益。

Abstract: Budget pacing is critical in online advertising to align spend with campaign
goals under dynamic auctions. Existing pacing methods often rely on ad-hoc
parameter tuning, which can be unstable and inefficient. We propose a
principled controller that combines bucketized hysteresis with proportional
feedback to provide stable and adaptive spend control. Our method provides a
framework and analysis for parameter selection that enables accurate tracking
of desired spend rates across campaigns. Experiments in real-world auctions
demonstrate significant improvements in pacing accuracy and delivery
consistency, reducing pacing error by 13% and $\lambda$-volatility by 54%
compared to baseline method. By bridging control theory with advertising
systems, our approach offers a scalable and reliable solution for budget
pacing, with particular benefits for small-budget campaigns.

TL;DR: 提出了Poly-GRACE框架，这是首个与同态加密兼容的图自监督学习方法，通过全多项式友好的GCN编码器和多项式对比损失函数，在保护隐私的同时保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自监督学习方法如GRACE依赖非多项式操作，无法与同态加密等隐私保护技术兼容，限制了隐私保护图表示学习的应用。

Method: 设计全多项式友好的图卷积网络编码器和基于多项式的对比损失函数，使整个框架与同态加密完全兼容。

Result: 在Cora、CiteSeer和PubMed三个基准数据集上，Poly-GRACE不仅支持隐私预训练，而且在CiteSeer上性能优于标准非隐私基线，在其他数据集上表现相当。

Conclusion: 这项工作为实现实用且高性能的隐私保护图表示学习迈出了重要一步，为隐私敏感场景下的图学习应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
learning representations on graph data without requiring manual labels.
However, leading SSL methods like GRACE are fundamentally incompatible with
privacy-preserving technologies such as Homomorphic Encryption (HE) due to
their reliance on non-polynomial operations. This paper introduces Poly-GRACE,
a novel framework for HE-compatible self-supervised learning on graphs. Our
approach consists of a fully polynomial-friendly Graph Convolutional Network
(GCN) encoder and a novel, polynomial-based contrastive loss function. Through
experiments on three benchmark datasets -- Cora, CiteSeer, and PubMed -- we
demonstrate that Poly-GRACE not only enables private pre-training but also
achieves performance that is highly competitive with, and in the case of
CiteSeer, superior to the standard non-private baseline. Our work represents a
significant step towards practical and high-performance privacy-preserving
graph representation learning.

Motivation: 解决现实环境中EEG伪迹检测面临的挑战：多通道方法计算效率低、对同时存在噪声的鲁棒性差、深度学习模型在准确性和复杂性之间的权衡问题。

Method: 混合频谱-时域框架：时域低通滤波（针对低频眼电伪迹）+频域功率谱密度分析（捕捉宽频谱肌电伪迹）+PCA优化的特征融合+轻量级多层感知机分类器。

Result: 在低信噪比（-7dB）下达到99%准确率，中等噪声（4dB）下>90%准确率；对同时存在的多源污染（眼电+肌电+白噪声）保持96%分类准确率；训练时间仅需30秒，比CNN快97%。

Conclusion: 该框架在临床适用性和计算效率之间架起桥梁，支持可穿戴脑机接口的实时使用；证明在噪声场景下，基于领域知识的特征融合优于复杂架构，挑战了模型深度对EEG伪迹检测的普遍依赖。

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) artifact detection in real-world settings faces
significant challenges such as computational inefficiency in multi-channel
methods, poor robustness to simultaneous noise, and trade-offs between accuracy
and complexity in deep learning models. We propose a hybrid spectral-temporal
framework for real-time detection and classification of ocular (EOG), muscular
(EMG), and white noise artifacts in single-channel EEG. This method, in
contrast to other approaches, combines time-domain low-pass filtering
(targeting low-frequency EOG) and frequency-domain power spectral density (PSD)
analysis (capturing broad-spectrum EMG), followed by PCA-optimized feature
fusion to minimize redundancy while preserving discriminative information. This
feature engineering strategy allows a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
architecture to outperform advanced CNNs and RNNs by achieving 99% accuracy at
low SNRs (SNR -7) dB and >90% accuracy in moderate noise (SNR 4 dB).
Additionally, this framework addresses the unexplored problem of simultaneous
multi-source contamination(EMG+EOG+white noise), where it maintains 96%
classification accuracy despite overlapping artifacts. With 30-second training
times (97% faster than CNNs) and robust performance across SNR levels, this
framework bridges the gap between clinical applicability and computational
efficiency, which enables real-time use in wearable brain-computer interfaces.
This work also challenges the ubiquitous dependence on model depth for EEG
artifact detection by demonstrating that domain-informed feature fusion
surpasses complex architecture in noisy scenarios.

Conclusion: 双曲优化方法在双曲流形上有效，能加速训练收敛，特别是在参数远离最优值的早期阶段，且适用于欧几里得和非欧几里得设置。

Abstract: This work explores optimization methods on hyperbolic manifolds. Building on
Riemannian optimization principles, we extend the Hyperbolic Stochastic
Gradient Descent (a specialization of Riemannian SGD) to a Hyperbolic Adam
optimizer. While these methods are particularly relevant for learning on the
Poincar\'e ball, they may also provide benefits in Euclidean and other
non-Euclidean settings, as the chosen optimization encourages the learning of
Poincar\'e embeddings. This representation, in turn, accelerates convergence in
the early stages of training, when parameters are far from the optimum. As a
case study, we train diffusion models using the hyperbolic optimization methods
with hyperbolic time-discretization of the Langevin dynamics, and show that
they achieve faster convergence on certain datasets without sacrificing
generative quality.

*Zenghui Huang,Ting Shu,Zhonglei Wang,Yang Lu,Yan Yan,Wei Zhong,Hanzi Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DPSformer是一个针对强降雨预测的长尾学习模型，通过高分辨率分支增强对罕见强降雨事件的表征，显著提升了强降雨预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强降雨预测对社会至关重要，但降雨数据分布高度不平衡——大部分是无雨或小雨，强降雨事件罕见。这种不平衡分布阻碍了深度学习模型有效预测强降雨事件。

Method: 将降雨预测明确视为长尾学习问题，引入DPSformer模型，通过高分辨率分支丰富强降雨事件的表征。

Result: 对于≥50mm/6h的强降雨事件，DPSformer将基准数值天气预报模型的CSI从0.012提升到0.067；对于前1%的强降雨事件，其FSS超过0.45，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作为强降雨预测建立了一个有效的长尾范式，提供了增强预警系统和减轻极端天气事件社会影响的实用工具。

Abstract: Accurate and timely forecasting of heavy rainfall remains a critical
challenge for modern society. Precipitation exhibits a highly imbalanced
distribution: most observations record no or light rain, while heavy rainfall
events are rare. Such an imbalanced distribution obstructs deep learning models
from effectively predicting heavy rainfall events. To address this challenge,
we treat rainfall forecasting explicitly as a long-tailed learning problem,
identifying the insufficient representation of heavy rainfall events as the
primary barrier to forecasting accuracy. Therefore, we introduce DPSformer, a
long-tail-aware model that enriches representation of heavy rainfall events
through a high-resolution branch. For heavy rainfall events $ \geq $ 50 mm/6 h,
DPSformer lifts the Critical Success Index (CSI) of a baseline Numerical
Weather Prediction (NWP) model from 0.012 to 0.067. For the top 1% coverage of
heavy rainfall events, its Fraction Skill Score (FSS) exceeds 0.45, surpassing
existing methods. Our work establishes an effective long-tailed paradigm for
heavy rainfall prediction, offering a practical tool to enhance early warning
systems and mitigate the societal impacts of extreme weather events.

TL;DR: 提出了STCast框架，通过空间对齐注意力机制自适应优化区域边界，并使用时间混合专家模块动态分配月度预测，在区域天气预报中超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有区域天气预报方法受限于静态和不精确的区域边界，导致泛化能力差，需要更自适应的边界优化方法。

Method: 使用空间对齐注意力机制对齐全局和区域空间分布来初始化边界，并基于注意力模式自适应优化边界；设计时间混合专家模块，通过离散高斯分布将不同月份的大气变量动态路由到专门专家。

Result: 在全局和区域预测、极端事件预测和集合预测四个任务上均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: STCast框架通过自适应边界优化和动态时间分配，显著提升了区域天气预报的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: To gain finer regional forecasts, many works have explored the regional
integration from the global atmosphere, e.g., by solving boundary equations in
physics-based methods or cropping regions from global forecasts in data-driven
methods. However, the effectiveness of these methods is often constrained by
static and imprecise regional boundaries, resulting in poor generalization
ability. To address this issue, we propose Spatial-Temporal Weather Forecasting
(STCast), a novel AI-driven framework for adaptive regional boundary
optimization and dynamic monthly forecast allocation. Specifically, our
approach employs a Spatial-Aligned Attention (SAA) mechanism, which aligns
global and regional spatial distributions to initialize boundaries and
adaptively refines them based on attention-derived alignment patterns.
Furthermore, we design a Temporal Mixture-of-Experts (TMoE) module, where
atmospheric variables from distinct months are dynamically routed to
specialized experts using a discrete Gaussian distribution, enhancing the
model's ability to capture temporal patterns. Beyond global and regional
forecasting, we evaluate our STCast on extreme event prediction and ensemble
forecasting. Experimental results demonstrate consistent superiority over
state-of-the-art methods across all four tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LEMs是一种新型深度学习框架，将transformer架构扩展到解决具有灵活时间边界和多重执行约束的复杂执行问题，通过解耦市场信息处理和分配决策来统一处理不同执行场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经VWAP执行策略主要针对固定时长订单，无法处理执行时长在最小和最大时间范围内变化的场景，类似于股票回购合约结构。需要开发能够适应灵活时间约束的统一执行模型。

Method: 使用Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (TKANs)、Variable Selection Networks (VSNs)和多头注意力机制构建通用特征提取管道处理市场数据，同时独立的分配网络处理不同场景的具体执行逻辑。

Result: 在日内加密货币市场和多日股票交易（道琼斯成分股）上的实证评估显示，LEMs在灵活时间约束内动态优化执行路径，相比传统基准方法获得更优的执行性能。

Conclusion: LEMs的统一模型架构能够通过单一框架部署到不同执行场景（买卖订单、变化时长边界、成交量/名义价值目标），相比资产特定方法具有显著操作优势。

Abstract: This paper introduces Large Execution Models (LEMs), a novel deep learning
framework that extends transformer-based architectures to address complex
execution problems with flexible time boundaries and multiple execution
constraints. Building upon recent advances in neural VWAP execution strategies,
LEMs generalize the approach from fixed-duration orders to scenarios where
execution duration is bounded between minimum and maximum time horizons,
similar to share buyback contract structures. The proposed architecture
decouples market information processing from execution allocation decisions: a
common feature extraction pipeline using Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
(TKANs), Variable Selection Networks (VSNs), and multi-head attention
mechanisms processes market data to create informational context, while
independent allocation networks handle the specific execution logic for
different scenarios (fixed quantity vs. fixed notional, buy vs. sell orders).
This architectural separation enables a unified model to handle diverse
execution objectives while leveraging shared market understanding across
scenarios. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation on intraday
cryptocurrency markets and multi-day equity trading using DOW Jones
constituents, we demonstrate that LEMs achieve superior execution performance
compared to traditional benchmarks by dynamically optimizing execution paths
within flexible time constraints. The unified model architecture enables
deployment across different execution scenarios (buy/sell orders, varying
duration boundaries, volume/notional targets) through a single framework,
providing significant operational advantages over asset-specific approaches.

Motivation: CNN超参数优化通常需要大量试错或网格搜索，计算成本高昂。本研究旨在将质量工程中的田口实验设计方法应用于CNN超参数优化，提高优化效率。

Method: 使用L12(211)正交阵列系统评估8个超参数：图像尺寸、颜色模式、激活函数、学习率、重缩放、洗牌、垂直翻转和水平翻转。开发了5种多目标优化方法，结合信噪比分析和新型对数缩放技术统一冲突指标。

Conclusion: 田口实验设计方法能有效优化CNN超参数，显著减少计算成本。学习率是拳击动作识别CNN中最关键的优化参数，该方法为超参数优先级提供了明确指导。

Abstract: The optimization of hyperparameters in convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
remains a challenging and computationally expensive process, often requiring
extensive trial-and-error approaches or exhaustive grid searches. This study
introduces the application of Taguchi Design of Experiments methodology, a
statistical optimization technique traditionally used in quality engineering,
to systematically optimize CNN hyperparameters for professional boxing action
recognition. Using an L12(211) orthogonal array, eight hyperparameters
including image size, color mode, activation function, learning rate,
rescaling, shuffling, vertical flip, and horizontal flip were systematically
evaluated across twelve experimental configurations. To address the
multi-objective nature of machine learning optimization, five different
approaches were developed to simultaneously optimize training accuracy,
validation accuracy, training loss, and validation loss using Signal-to-Noise
ratio analysis. The study employed a novel logarithmic scaling technique to
unify conflicting metrics and enable comprehensive multi-quality assessment
within the Taguchi framework. Results demonstrate that Approach 3, combining
weighted accuracy metrics with logarithmically transformed loss functions,
achieved optimal performance with 98.84% training accuracy and 86.25%
validation accuracy while maintaining minimal loss values. The Taguchi analysis
revealed that learning rate emerged as the most influential parameter, followed
by image size and activation function, providing clear guidance for
hyperparameter prioritization in CNN optimization.

TL;DR: CoA-LoRA是一种动态调整LoRA适配器以适应任意量化配置的方法，无需重复微调，通过配置感知模型将配置映射到低秩调整，并使用帕累托优化配置搜索来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大模型在边缘设备上的部署需求增加，需要有效的压缩方法。现有方法需要为每个量化配置单独微调LoRA适配器，这在计算上不可行，特别是考虑到边缘设备的异构能力。

Method: 提出CoA-LoRA方法，通过配置感知模型动态调整LoRA适配器以适应任意量化配置；设计了基于帕累托的配置搜索算法，迭代优化训练配置集以获得更精确的低秩调整。

Result: 实验表明，CoA-LoRA在不增加时间成本的情况下，实现了与需要为每个配置单独微调的最先进方法相当甚至更优的性能。

Conclusion: CoA-LoRA提供了一种高效的方法来处理边缘设备上的模型量化问题，避免了重复微调的计算开销，同时保持了模型性能。

Abstract: As increasingly large pre-trained models are released, deploying them on edge
devices for privacy-preserving applications requires effective compression.
Recent works combine quantization with the fine-tuning of high-precision LoRA
adapters, which can substantially reduce model size while mitigating the
accuracy loss from quantization. However, edge devices have inherently
heterogeneous capabilities, while performing configuration-wise fine-tuning for
every quantization setting is computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we
propose CoA-LoRA, a method that dynamically adjusts the LoRA adapter to
arbitrary quantization configurations (i.e., the per-layer bit-width choices of
a pre-trained model) without requiring repeated fine-tuning. This is
accomplished via a configuration-aware model that maps each configuration to
its low-rank adjustments. The effectiveness of this model critically depends on
the training configuration set, a collection of configurations chosen to cover
different total bit-width budgets. However, constructing a high-quality
configuration set is non-trivial. We therefore design a Pareto-based
configuration search that iteratively optimizes the training configuration set,
yielding more precise low-rank adjustments. Our experiments demonstrate that,
unlike the state-of-the-art methods that require fine-tuning a separate LoRA
adapter for each configuration, CoA-LoRA incurs no additional time cost while
achieving comparable or even superior performance to those methods.

Abstract: In this article, we suggest a novel non-supervised partition based anomaly
detection method for anomaly detection in multivariate time series called
PARADISE. This methodology creates a partition of the variables of the time
series while ensuring that the inter-variable relations remain untouched. This
partitioning relies on the clustering of multiple correlation coefficients
between variables to identify subsets of variables before executing anomaly
detection algorithms locally for each of those subsets. Through multiple
experimentations done on both synthetic and real datasets coming from the
literature, we show the relevance of our approach with a significant
improvement in anomaly detection performance.

Motivation: 传统学习理论描述了模型复杂度与预测误差之间的U型关系，但近期研究提出了双下降现象。本文旨在通过生物分类任务验证双下降是否在简单模型中也存在，并探究其产生条件。

Method: 使用结核分枝杆菌异烟肼耐药性预测任务，系统性地在正交的两个维度上调整模型复杂度：学习器容量和集成规模，并在合成基准上复现结果。

Result: 只有当复杂度在两个维度上同时扩展时才会出现双下降现象；固定任一维度时，泛化行为都会回归到经典的U型或L型模式。

Conclusion: 双下降现象源于不同泛化机制在单一复杂度轴上的投影，强调在分析泛化行为时应将模型复杂度视为多维构造。

Abstract: Classical learning theory describes a well-characterised U-shaped
relationship between model complexity and prediction error, reflecting a
transition from underfitting in underparameterised regimes to overfitting as
complexity grows. Recent work, however, has introduced the notion of a second
descent in test error beyond the interpolation threshold-giving rise to the
so-called double descent phenomenon. While double descent has been studied
extensively in the context of deep learning, it has also been reported in
simpler models, including decision trees and gradient boosting. In this work,
we revisit these claims through the lens of classical machine learning applied
to a biological classification task: predicting isoniazid resistance in
Mycobacterium tuberculosis using whole-genome sequencing data. We
systematically vary model complexity along two orthogonal axes-learner capacity
(e.g., Pleaf, Pboost) and ensemble size (i.e., Pens)-and show that double
descent consistently emerges only when complexity is scaled jointly across
these axes. When either axis is held fixed, generalisation behaviour reverts to
classical U- or L-shaped patterns. These results are replicated on a synthetic
benchmark and support the unfolding hypothesis, which attributes double descent
to the projection of distinct generalisation regimes onto a single complexity
axis. Our findings underscore the importance of treating model complexity as a
multidimensional construct when analysing generalisation behaviour. All code

TL;DR: L2C是一个可扩展的数据驱动框架，通过训练神经网络来加速概率图模型中的最可能解释推理，显著减少搜索空间并保持或提高解决方案质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 概率图模型中的最可能解释推理是一个本质上难以处理的问题，现有方法在处理高树宽模型时效率低下，需要更有效的加速方法。

Method: 开发了可扩展的数据生成管道，从现有MPE求解器的搜索轨迹中提取训练信号，训练神经网络来评估变量赋值对条件化的效用，并将训练好的网络作为启发式方法与搜索算法集成。

Result: 在涉及高树宽PGMs的挑战性MPE查询上的实验表明，学习到的启发式方法显著减少了搜索空间，同时在解决方案质量上保持或优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: L2C框架成功地将机器学习与经典推理算法相结合，为加速PGMs中的MPE推理提供了一种有效的数据驱动方法。

Abstract: We introduce learning to condition (L2C), a scalable, data-driven framework
for accelerating Most Probable Explanation (MPE) inference in Probabilistic
Graphical Models (PGMs), a fundamentally intractable problem. L2C trains a
neural network to score variable-value assignments based on their utility for
conditioning, given observed evidence. To facilitate supervised learning, we
develop a scalable data generation pipeline that extracts training signals from
the search traces of existing MPE solvers. The trained network serves as a
heuristic that integrates with search algorithms, acting as a conditioning
strategy prior to exact inference or as a branching and node selection policy
within branch-and-bound solvers. We evaluate L2C on challenging MPE queries
involving high-treewidth PGMs. Experiments show that our learned heuristic
significantly reduces the search space while maintaining or improving solution
quality over state-of-the-art methods.

Method: 开发了TinyDES-Clustering库，采用动态集成选择聚类方法，针对嵌入式系统限制进行优化。

Conclusion: 动态集成选择聚类方法能够有效平衡TinyML系统中的分类精度和推理性能，但需要在精度和效率之间进行权衡。

Abstract: The recent progress in TinyML technologies triggers the need to address the
challenge of balancing inference time and classification quality. TinyML
systems are defined by specific constraints in computation, memory and energy.
These constraints emphasize the need for specialized optimization techniques
when implementing Machine Learning (ML) applications on such platforms. While
deep neural networks are widely used in TinyML, the exploration of Dynamic
Ensemble Selection (DES) methods is also beneficial. This study examines a
DES-Clustering approach for a multi-class computer vision task within TinyML
systems. This method allows for adjusting classification accuracy, thereby
affecting latency and energy consumption per inference. We implemented the
TinyDES-Clustering library, optimized for embedded system limitations.
Experiments have shown that a larger pool of classifiers for dynamic selection
improves classification accuracy, and thus leads to an increase in average
inference time on the TinyML device.

Abstract: We propose a physics-informed machine-learned framework for sensor-based flow
estimation for drone trajectories in complex urban terrain. The input is a rich
set of flow simulations at many wind conditions. The outputs are velocity and
uncertainty estimates for a target domain and subsequent sensor optimization
for minimal uncertainty. The framework has three innovations compared to
traditional flow estimators. First, the algorithm scales proportionally to the
domain complexity, making it suitable for flows that are too complex for any
monolithic reduced-order representation. Second, the framework extrapolates
beyond the training data, e.g., smaller and larger wind velocities. Last, and
perhaps most importantly, the sensor location is a free input, significantly
extending the vast majority of the literature. The key enablers are (1) a
Reynolds number-based scaling of the flow variables, (2) a physics-based domain
decomposition, (3) a cluster-based flow representation for each subdomain, (4)
an information entropy correlating the subdomains, and (5) a multi-variate
probability function relating sensor input and targeted velocity estimates.
This framework is demonstrated using drone flight paths through a
three-building cluster as a simple example. We anticipate adaptations and
applications for estimating complete cities and incorporating weather input.

*Xunhao Lai,Jialiang Kang,Jianqiao Lu,Tong Lin,Pengyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Residual Linear Attention (RLA)框架，通过显式残差拟合机制增强线性注意力的表达能力，解决了传统线性注意力在捕捉长距离模式时的瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性注意力虽然具有线性时间复杂度，但在捕捉长距离模式方面表现不佳。研究发现现有变体可表示为历史预测和单令牌校正的组合，这造成了表达能力瓶颈。

Method: 引入RLA框架，通过维护辅助循环状态来累积残差误差并校正基础预测。进一步实例化了Residual Delta Net (RDN)，包含自适应门控和残差裁剪以增强校正控制和稳定性。

Result: 在语言建模和回忆密集型评估中，RLA和RDN始终优于各自基线和现代线性注意力方法，缩小了与标准Transformer的差距，同时保持线性缩放。

Conclusion: RLA框架有效解决了线性注意力的表达能力瓶颈，通过残差拟合机制显著提升了性能，在保持线性复杂度的同时接近标准Transformer的表现。

Abstract: Linear attention offers a linear-time alternative to self-attention but often
struggles to capture long-range patterns. We revisit linear attention through a
prediction-correction lens and show that prevalent variants can be written as a
combination of a historical prediction and a single-token correction, which
creates an expressivity bottleneck. To address this bottleneck, we introduce
Residual Linear Attention (RLA), a framework that equips linear attention with
an explicit residual-fitting mechanism. RLA maintains an auxiliary recurrent
state that learns to accumulate residual errors over time and correct the base
prediction. We further instantiate a delta-rule version, Residual Delta Net
(RDN), incorporating adaptive gating and residual clipping for enhanced
correction control and stability. Our implementation leverages highly optimized
linear attention kernels and preserves linear time and memory. Across language
modeling and recall-intensive evaluations, RLA and RDN consistently outperform
their respective baselines and other modern linear-attention methods, narrowing
the gap to standard Transformers while retaining linear scaling.

Motivation: 确保电网韧性需要及时无监督地检测同步相量数据流中的异常，传统方法依赖人工标注数据，难以适应实时监控需求。

Method: 集成窗口注意力Transformer到双向生成对抗网络中，使用自注意力编码器-解码器架构捕获复杂时空依赖关系，通过联合判别器强制执行循环一致性。

Result: 在硬件在环PMU基准测试中，T-BiGAN实现了0.95的ROC-AUC和0.996的平均精度，显著优于领先的监督和无监督方法。

Conclusion: T-BiGAN在检测细微频率和电压偏差方面表现优异，证明其在无需人工标注故障数据的情况下，对实时广域监控具有实际价值。

Abstract: Ensuring power grid resilience requires the timely and unsupervised detection
of anomalies in synchrophasor data streams. We introduce T-BiGAN, a novel
framework that integrates window-attention Transformers within a bidirectional
Generative Adversarial Network (BiGAN) to address this challenge. Its
self-attention encoder-decoder architecture captures complex spatio-temporal
dependencies across the grid, while a joint discriminator enforces cycle
consistency to align the learned latent space with the true data distribution.
Anomalies are flagged in real-time using an adaptive score that combines
reconstruction error, latent space drift, and discriminator confidence.
Evaluated on a realistic hardware-in-the-loop PMU benchmark, T-BiGAN achieves
an ROC-AUC of 0.95 and an average precision of 0.996, significantly
outperforming leading supervised and unsupervised methods. It shows particular
strength in detecting subtle frequency and voltage deviations, demonstrating
its practical value for live, wide-area monitoring without relying on manually
labeled fault data.

Motivation: 多头部潜在注意力(MLA)虽然显著减少了大型语言模型中的KVCache内存使用，但带来了大量计算开销和中间变量扩展，特别是在解码阶段对硬件实现提出了挑战。

Method: 1. 基于FlashAttention的新算法，用整数加法替代浮点乘法进行输出块重缩放，利用FP32和INT32表示之间的二进制对应关系；2. 具有分层平铺的预加载流水线策略，最大化FLOPS利用率。

Conclusion: AMLA内核已集成到华为CANN中，即将发布，为MLA在昇腾NPU上的高效实现提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) significantly reduces KVCache memory usage
in Large Language Models while introducing substantial computational overhead
and intermediate variable expansion. This poses challenges for efficient
hardware implementation -- especially during the decode phase. This paper
introduces Ascend MLA (AMLA), a high-performance kernel specifically optimized
for Huawei's Ascend NPUs. AMLA is built on two core innovations: (1) A novel
FlashAttention-based algorithm that replaces floating-point multiplications
with integer additions for output block rescaling, leveraging binary
correspondence between FP32 and INT32 representations; (2) A Preload Pipeline
strategy with hierarchical tiling that maximizes FLOPS utilization: the Preload
Pipeline achieves Cube-bound performance, while hierarchical tiling overlaps
data movement and computation within the Cube core. Experiments show that on
Ascend 910 NPUs (integrated in CloudMatrix384), AMLA achieves up to 614 TFLOPS,
reaching 86.8% of the theoretical maximum FLOPS, outperforming the
state-of-the-art open-source FlashMLA implementation, whose FLOPS utilization
is up to 66.7% on NVIDIA H800 SXM5. The AMLA kernel has been integrated into
Huawei's CANN and will be released soon.

Conclusion: MC-CLE方法能够有效学习无线定位中的不确定性特性，在不确定性量化方面优于传统方法

Abstract: Modern wireless systems require not only position estimates, but also

Candidate-Likelihood Estimation (MC-CLE), which trains a neural scoring network
using Monte Carlo sampling to compare true and candidate transmitter locations.
We show that in line-of-sight simulations with a multi-antenna receiver, MC-CLE

antenna patterns. MC-CLE also achieves lower cross-entropy loss relative to a
uniform baseline and Gaussian posteriors. alternatives under a uniform-loss

Motivation: 当前基于结构的药物设计方法难以捕捉蛋白质-配体相互作用的多尺度复杂性和内在不对称性，需要新的建模框架来克服这些限制。

Method: 开发了多尺度信息瓶颈(MSIB)进行层次特征提取，以及多头协作注意力(MHCA)机制处理蛋白质与配体之间的维度差异和不对称相互作用。

Result: 在基准数据集上优于最先进方法，在KRAS G12D等挑战性靶点的案例研究中证明了实际应用价值。

Conclusion: MSCoD通过贝叶斯更新框架有效解决了蛋白质-配体相互作用的多尺度建模问题，为基于结构的药物设计提供了新工具。

Abstract: Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) is a powerful strategy in computational
drug discovery, utilizing three-dimensional protein structures to guide the
design of molecules with improved binding affinity. However, capturing complex
protein-ligand interactions across multiple scales remains challenging, as
current methods often overlook the hierarchical organization and intrinsic
asymmetry of these interactions. To address these limitations, we propose
MSCoD, a novel Bayesian updating-based generative framework for structure-based
drug design. In our MSCoD, Multi-Scale Information Bottleneck (MSIB) was
developed, which enables semantic compression at multiple abstraction levels
for efficient hierarchical feature extraction. Furthermore, a multi-head
cooperative attention (MHCA) mechanism was developed, which employs asymmetric
protein-to-ligand attention to capture diverse interaction types while
addressing the dimensionality disparity between proteins and ligands. Empirical
studies showed that MSCoD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark
dataset. Case studies on challenging targets such as KRAS G12D further
demonstrate its applicability in real-world scenarios. The code and data

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于贝叶斯优化的多元变分模态分解-长短期记忆网络框架，用于集成风-光-波海洋能源系统的超短期功率预测，显著提升了预测精度和自动化程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预测方法多为单能源独立建模，未能充分考虑多能源间的复杂耦合关系，难以捕捉系统的非线性和非平稳动态特性，且依赖大量人工参数调优，限制了预测性能和实用性。

Method: 使用MVMD联合分解风、光、波功率序列以保持跨源耦合关系；采用贝叶斯优化自动搜索MVMD过程中的模态数量和惩罚参数以获得本征模态函数；最后用LSTM对得到的IMF进行建模，实现集成系统的超短期功率预测。

Conclusion: 该贝叶斯优化的MVMD-LSTM框架有效解决了集成风-光-波海洋能源系统的超短期预测问题，为海上清洁电力供应提供了可靠的技术支持。

Abstract: Integrated wind-solar-wave marine energy systems hold broad promise for
supplying clean electricity in offshore and coastal regions. By leveraging the
spatiotemporal complementarity of multiple resources, such systems can
effectively mitigate the intermittency and volatility of single-source outputs,
thereby substantially improving overall power-generation efficiency and
resource utilization. Accurate ultra-short-term forecasting is crucial for
ensuring secure operation and optimizing proactive dispatch. However, most
existing forecasting methods construct separate models for each energy source,
insufficiently account for the complex couplings among multiple energies,
struggle to capture the system's nonlinear and nonstationary dynamics, and
typically depend on extensive manual parameter tuning-limitations that
constrain both predictive performance and practicality. We address this issue
using a Bayesian-optimized Multivariate Variational Mode Decomposition-Long
Short-Term Memory (MVMD-LSTM) framework. The framework first applies MVMD to
jointly decompose wind, solar and wave power series so as to preserve
cross-source couplings; it uses Bayesian optimization to automatically search
the number of modes and the penalty parameter in the MVMD process to obtain
intrinsic mode functions (IMFs); finally, an LSTM models the resulting IMFs to
achieve ultra-short-term power forecasting for the integrated system.
Experiments based on field measurements from an offshore integrated energy
platform in China show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms
benchmark models in terms of MAPE, RMSE and MAE. The results demonstrate
superior predictive accuracy, robustness, and degree of automation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统dQ/dV计算方法依赖有限差分和滤波，会放大传感器噪声并引入峰值位置偏差，需要更可靠的析锂检测方法

Method: 使用高斯过程框架直接建模Q(V)关系，利用GP导数仍为GP的性质，从后验分布中解析推断dQ/dV，提供噪声感知推理和不确定性量化

Result: 在0.2C-1C倍率和0-40°C温度范围内的实验验证表明，该方法能可靠检测低温高倍率充电下的析锂峰值，并在基线情况下正确报告无峰值

Conclusion: 该方法建立了实时锂电析锂检测的实用途径，GP识别的微分峰值与充电通量减少、容量衰减的测量结果一致，证实了方法的准确性和鲁棒性

Abstract: Lithium plating during fast charging is a critical degradation mechanism that
accelerates capacity fade and can trigger catastrophic safety failures. Recent
work has identified a distinctive dQ/dV peak above 4.0 V as a reliable
signature of plating onset; however, conventional methods for computing dQ/dV
rely on finite differencing with filtering, which amplifies sensor noise and
introduces bias in peak location. In this paper, we propose a Gaussian Process
(GP) framework for lithium plating detection by directly modeling the
charge-voltage relationship Q(V) as a stochastic process with calibrated
uncertainty. Leveraging the property that derivatives of GPs remain GPs, we
infer dQ/dV analytically and probabilistically from the posterior, enabling
robust detection without ad hoc smoothing. The framework provides three key
benefits: (i) noise-aware inference with hyperparameters learned from data,
(ii) closed-form derivatives with credible intervals for uncertainty
quantification, and (iii) scalability to online variants suitable for embedded
BMS. Experimental validation on Li-ion coin cells across a range of C-rates
(0.2C-1C) and temperatures (0-40\deg C) demonstrates that the GP-based method
reliably detects plating peaks under low-temperature, high-rate charging, while
correctly reporting no peaks in baseline cases. The concurrence of
GP-identified differential peaks, reduced charge throughput, and capacity fade
measured via reference performance tests confirms the method's accuracy and
robustness, establishing a practical pathway for real-time lithium plating
detection.

Motivation: 为可逆标准化流提供一个理论严谨且实用的框架，连接随机投影理论与标准化流，克服PCA流和学习的可逆映射的局限性。

Method: 使用通过高斯矩阵QR分解从Haar分布正交系综中抽取的随机半正交矩阵，将数据投影到低维潜在空间用于基分布，并提供黎曼体积修正项的闭式表达式。

Conclusion: RPFs提供了一个即插即用、高效的可逆标准化流框架，在随机投影理论与标准化流之间建立了桥梁。

Abstract: We introduce Random Projection Flows (RPFs), a principled framework for
injective normalizing flows that leverages tools from random matrix theory and
the geometry of random projections. RPFs employ random semi-orthogonal
matrices, drawn from Haar-distributed orthogonal ensembles via QR decomposition
of Gaussian matrices, to project data into lower-dimensional latent spaces for
the base distribution. Unlike PCA-based flows or learned injective maps, RPFs
are plug-and-play, efficient, and yield closed-form expressions for the
Riemannian volume correction term. We demonstrate that RPFs are both
theoretically grounded and practically effective, providing a strong baseline
for generative modeling and a bridge between random projection theory and
normalizing flows.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够更准确地学习数据几何结构，为流匹配提供更好的归纳偏置。

Abstract: A useful inductive bias for temporal data is that trajectories should stay
close to the data manifold. Traditional flow matching relies on straight
conditional paths, and flow matching methods which learn geodesics rely on RBF
kernels or nearest neighbor graphs that suffer from the curse of

distillation to learn a metric tensor that faithfully captures the underlying

Conclusion: WDformer通过小波变换和差分注意力机制，有效解决了时间序列预测中的多域信息利用和噪声抑制问题，展现出优异的性能。

Abstract: Time series forecasting has various applications, such as meteorological
rainfall prediction, traffic flow analysis, financial forecasting, and
operational load monitoring for various systems. Due to the sparsity of time
series data, relying solely on time-domain or frequency-domain modeling limits
the model's ability to fully leverage multi-domain information. Moreover, when
applied to time series forecasting tasks, traditional attention mechanisms tend
to over-focus on irrelevant historical information, which may introduce noise
into the prediction process, leading to biased results. We proposed WDformer, a
wavelet-based differential Transformer model. This study employs the wavelet
transform to conduct a multi-resolution analysis of time series data. By
leveraging the advantages of joint representation in the time-frequency domain,
it accurately extracts the key information components that reflect the
essential characteristics of the data. Furthermore, we apply attention
mechanisms on inverted dimensions, allowing the attention mechanism to capture
relationships between multiple variables. When performing attention
calculations, we introduced the differential attention mechanism, which
computes the attention score by taking the difference between two separate
softmax attention matrices. This approach enables the model to focus more on
important information and reduce noise. WDformer has achieved state-of-the-art
(SOTA) results on multiple challenging real-world datasets, demonstrating its
accuracy and effectiveness. Code is available at

Conclusion: GMA采样器提供了一种高效、无需梯度的采样框架，能够准确逼近目标分布，适用于各种复杂密度函数。

Abstract: We present a family of \textit{Gaussian Mixture Approximation} (GMA) samplers
for sampling unnormalised target densities, encompassing \textit{weights-only
GMA} (W-GMA), \textit{Laplace Mixture Approximation} (LMA),
\textit{expectation-maximization GMA} (EM-GMA), and further variants. GMA
adopts a simple two-stage paradigm: (i) initialise a finite set of Gaussian
components and draw samples from a proposal mixture; (ii) fit the mixture to
the target by optimising either only the component weights or also the means
and variances, via a sample-based KL divergence objective that requires only
evaluations of the unnormalised density, followed by stratified resampling. The
method is gradient-free, and computationally efficient: it leverages the ease
of sampling from Gaussians, efficient optimisation methods (projected gradient
descent, mirror descent, and EM), and the robustness of stratified resampling
to produce samples faithful to the target. We show that this
optimisation-resampling scheme yields consistent approximations under mild
conditions, and we validate this methodology with empirical results
demonstrating accuracy and speed across diverse densities.

Conclusion: FedCLF能有效应对车联网中的高度数据异构性，在保持隐私的同时提升模型性能和资源利用效率。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique that
preserves data privacy by sharing only the trained parameters instead of the
client data. This makes FL ideal for highly dynamic, heterogeneous, and
time-critical applications, in particular, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV)
networks. However, FL encounters considerable challenges in such networks owing
to the high data and device heterogeneity. To address these challenges, we
propose FedCLF, i.e., FL with Calibrated Loss and Feedback control, which
introduces calibrated loss as a utility in the participant selection process
and a feedback control mechanism to dynamically adjust the sampling frequency
of the clients. The envisaged approach (a) enhances the overall model accuracy
in case of highly heterogeneous data and (b) optimizes the resource utilization
for resource constrained IoV networks, thereby leading to increased efficiency
in the FL process. We evaluated FedCLF vis-\`a-vis baseline models, i.e.,
FedAvg, Newt, and Oort, using CIFAR-10 dataset with varying data heterogeneity.
Our results depict that FedCLF significantly outperforms the baseline models by
up to a 16% improvement in high data heterogeneity-related scenarios with
improved efficiency via reduced sampling frequency.

Abstract: Correct identification of failure mechanisms is essential for manufacturers
to ensure the quality of their products. Certain failures of printheads
developed by Canon Production Printing can be identified from the behavior of
individual nozzles, the states of which are constantly recorded and can form
distinct patterns in terms of the number of failed nozzles over time, and in
space in the nozzle grid. In our work, we investigate the problem of printhead
failure classification based on a multifaceted dataset of nozzle logging and
propose a Machine Learning classification approach for this problem. We follow
the feature-based framework of time-series classification, where a set of
time-based and spatial features was selected with the guidance of domain
experts. Several traditional ML classifiers were evaluated, and the One-vs-Rest
Random Forest was found to have the best performance. The proposed model
outperformed an in-house rule-based baseline in terms of a weighted F1 score
for several failure mechanisms.

Conclusion: 将领域调优的自监督与测试时训练相结合，能够有效提升大规模EEG基础模型的鲁棒性和准确性，为通用脑机接口应用提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models for EEG signals offer a promising path to
generalizable brain-computer interface (BCI) applications, but they often
suffer from misalignment between pretraining objectives and downstream tasks,
as well as significant cross-subject distribution shifts. This paper addresses
these challenges by introducing a two-stage alignment strategy that bridges the
gap between generic pretraining and specific EEG decoding tasks. First, we
propose NeuroTTT: a domain-specific self-supervised fine-tuning paradigm that
augments the foundation model with task-relevant self-supervised objectives,
aligning latent representations to important spectral, spatial, and temporal
EEG features without requiring additional labeled data. Second, we incorporate
test-time training (TTT) at inference, we perform (i) self-supervised test-time
training on individual unlabeled test samples and (ii) prediction entropy
minimization (Tent), which updates only normalization statistics to continually
calibrate the model to each new input on the fly. Our approach, which, to our
knowledge, is the first to unify domain-tuned self-supervision with test-time
training in large-scale EEG foundation models, yields substantially improved
robustness and accuracy across diverse BCI tasks (imagined speech, stress
detection, motor imagery). Using CBraMod and LaBraM as backbones, our method
pushes their performance to a markedly higher level. Results on three diverse
tasks demonstrate that the proposed alignment strategy achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming conventional fine-tuning and
adaptation methods. Our code is available at

TL;DR: PALADIN是一个训练语言代理具备故障恢复能力的框架，通过系统性地注入故障和专家演示来训练模型，使其能够在工具故障时进行有效恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言代理在真实部署中经常因工具故障（如超时、API异常、输出不一致）而失败，导致级联推理错误和任务放弃。现有训练方法只优化成功轨迹，无法处理真实世界中普遍存在的工具故障。

Method: PALADIN通过系统故障注入和专家演示构建50,000+恢复标注轨迹进行训练，使用LoRA微调保留基础能力并注入恢复能力。推理时检测执行错误，从55+故障示例库中检索相似案例并执行相应恢复动作。

Result: 在PaladinEval和ToolReflectEval评估中，恢复率从32.76%提升至89.68%（相对提升57%），优于最强基线CRITIC（76.34%）13.3%。对未见工具API保持95.2%的恢复性能。

Conclusion: PALADIN是构建容错代理的有效方法，能够在真实工具环境中实现稳健的故障恢复。

Abstract: Tool-augmented language agents frequently fail in real-world deployment due
to tool malfunctions--timeouts, API exceptions, or inconsistent
outputs--triggering cascading reasoning errors and task abandonment. Existing
agent training pipelines optimize only for success trajectories, failing to
expose models to the tool failures that dominate real-world usage. We propose
\textbf{PALADIN}, a generalizable framework for equipping language agents with
robust failure recovery capabilities. PALADIN trains on 50,000+
recovery-annotated trajectories constructed via systematic failure injection
and expert demonstrations on an enhanced ToolBench dataset. Training uses
LoRA-based fine-tuning to retain base capabilities while injecting recovery
competence. At inference, PALADIN detects execution-time errors and retrieves
the most similar case from a curated bank of 55+ failure exemplars aligned with
ToolScan's taxonomy, then executes the corresponding recovery action. This
approach generalizes to novel failures beyond the training distribution,
retaining 95.2\% recovery performance on unseen tool APIs. Evaluation across
PaladinEval and ToolReflectEval demonstrates consistent improvements in
Recovery Rate (RR), Task Success Rate (TSR), Catastrophic Success Rate (CSR),
and Efficiency Score (ES). PALADIN improves RR from 32.76% to 89.68% (+57%
relative) over ToolBench and outperforms the strongest baseline CRITIC (76.34%)
by +13.3%. Against vanilla agents, PALADIN achieves 89.86\% RR (+66% relative
improvement from 23.75%). These results establish PALADIN as an effective
method for building fault-tolerant agents capable of robust recovery in
real-world tool environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于难度的课程强化学习方法存在局部优化问题，早期持续训练简单样本会导致策略失去探索能力。

Method: 将数据集评估中的多样性指标引入动态强化学习过程，通过最小语义汉密尔顿路径对训练样本进行排序，使初始训练保留更多探索性。

Result: HAMMER能够激发模型"好奇心"，在多个推理基准上实现3%到4%的平均准确率提升。

Conclusion: 从泛化边界理论视角看，多样性驱动的排序有助于稳定收敛，HAMMER方法在课程强化学习中表现出色。

Abstract: Recent curriculum reinforcement learning for large language models (LLMs)
typically rely on difficulty-based annotations for data filtering and ordering.
However, such methods suffer from local optimization, where continual training
on simple samples in the early steps can cause the policy to lose its
exploration. We propose a novel schema, namely Hamiltonian curiosity augmented
large language model reinforcement (HAMMER), that transfers diversity metrics,
commonly used in dataset evaluation, into the dynamic reinforcement learning
procedure, where training samples are ordered via a minimum-semantic
Hamiltonian path making the initial training retrain more exploration. From a
theoretical perspective of generalization bounds, diversity-driven ordering
facilitates stable convergence. Empirical evaluations indicate that HAMMER
stimulates model "curiosity" and consistently achieves a 3% to 4% average
accuracy gain across diverse inference benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在需要专业知识的专门领域（如网络安全）中的零样本表现往往不理想，因为基础模型是为通用应用设计的，难以在参数空间中封装领域特定知识。

Method: 研究了监督微调(SFT)、低秩适应(LoRA)和量化低秩适应(QLoRA)三种微调方法，使用网络安全问答数据集进行实验。

Result: 这些微调方法在网络安全问答任务中显著优于基础模型。LoRA和QLoRA在性能上与SFT相当，但计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: 低秩微调策略有潜力弥合通用大型语言模型与领域特定应用之间的差距，为适应专门领域提供了高效途径。

Abstract: Recent advancements in training paradigms for Large Language Models (LLMs)
have unlocked their remarkable capabilities in natural language processing and
cross-domain generalization. While LLMs excel in tasks like programming and
mathematical problem-solving, their zero-shot performance in specialized
domains requiring expert knowledge, such as cybersecurity, is often suboptimal.
This limitation arises because foundational LLMs are designed for
general-purpose applications, constraining their ability to encapsulate
domain-specific expertise within their parameter space. To address this, we
explore fine-tuning strategies to embed cybersecurity knowledge into LLMs,
enhancing their performance in cybersecurity question-answering (Q\&A) tasks
while prioritizing computational efficiency. Specifically, we investigate
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and Quantized
Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) using a cybersecurity Q\&A dataset. Our results
demonstrate that these fine-tuning approaches significantly outperform the
foundational model in cybersecurity Q\&A tasks. Moreover, LoRA and QLoRA
achieve comparable performance to SFT with substantially lower computational
costs, offering an efficient pathway for adapting LLMs to specialized domains.
Our work highlights the potential of low-rank fine-tuning strategies to bridge
the gap between general-purpose LLMs and domain-specific applications.

Motivation: 传统特征蒸馏方法无法有效捕捉教师模型的特征空间结构，即使损失为零时也存在问题，需要更有效的特征几何表示方法。

Method: 使用Procrustes距离和特征Gram矩阵的Frobenius范数作为蒸馏损失函数，这些距离在表示对齐测量中已经很常见。

Result: 在BERT和OPT模型上的分类和指令跟随任务中，新方法比现有方法提升了高达2个百分点，具有统计学显著改进。

Conclusion: 将特征几何整合到现有蒸馏方法中具有巨大潜力，新方法能更有效地传递教师模型的特征空间结构。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a common paradigm for transferring capabilities
from larger models to smaller ones. While traditional distillation methods
leverage a probabilistic divergence over the output of the teacher and student
models, feature-based distillation methods often minimize variants of Euclidean
norms between the hidden layer representations. The main goal is for the
student to mimic the structure of the feature space of the teacher. In this
work, we theoretically show that existing feature distillation methods, such as
projection based mean squared loss or Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), cannot
capture the feature structure, even under zero loss. We then motivate the use
of Procrustes distance and the Frobenius norm of Feature Gram Matrix, distances
already common in the context of measuring representational alignment, as
distillation losses. We show that feature distillation through our method
showcases statistically significant improvement in distillation performance
across language models families (BERT and OPT) in classification and
instruction-following tasks by up to 2 percentage points, showcasing the
potential of integrating feature geometry into existing distillation methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有气象时间序列预测基准主要评估温度、湿度等周期性强的变量，无法反映降雨临近预报这种更复杂实际场景的模型能力。降雨预测具有零膨胀、时间衰减和非平稳性等挑战。

Method: 构建RainfallBench数据集，包含5年15分钟间隔的6个关键气象变量数据。设计专门的评估策略评估多尺度预测和极端降雨事件。提出BFPF插件模块，融入领域先验知识来增强降雨时间序列预测。

Result: 在RainfallBench上评估了20多个最先进模型和6种主要架构。统计分析和消融研究验证了数据集的全面性和方法的优越性。

Conclusion: RainfallBench填补了降雨临近预报基准的空白，BFPF模块有效解决了现有模型忽视的零膨胀和时间衰减问题，为降雨预测研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Rainfall nowcasting, which aims to predict precipitation within the next 0 to
3 hours, is critical for disaster mitigation and real-time response planning.
However, most time series forecasting benchmarks in meteorology are evaluated
on variables with strong periodicity, such as temperature and humidity, which
fail to reflect model capabilities in more complex and practically meteorology
scenarios like rainfall nowcasting. To address this gap, we propose
RainfallBench, a benchmark designed for rainfall nowcasting, a highly
challenging and practically relevant task characterized by zero inflation,
temporal decay, and non-stationarity, focused on predicting precipitation
within the next 0 to 3 hours. The dataset is derived from five years of
meteorological observations, recorded at 15-minute intervals across six
essential variables, and collected from more than 12,000 GNSS stations
globally. In particular, it incorporates precipitable water vapor (PWV), a
crucial indicator of rainfall that is absent in other datasets. We further
design specialized evaluation strategies to assess model performance on key
meteorological challenges, such as multi-scale prediction and extreme rainfall
events, and evaluate over 20 state-of-the-art models across six major
architectures on RainfallBench. Additionally, to address the zero-inflation and
temporal decay issues overlooked by existing models, we introduce Bi-Focus
Precipitation Forecaster (BFPF), a plug-and-play module that incorporates
domain-specific priors to enhance rainfall time series forecasting. Statistical
analysis and ablation studies validate the comprehensiveness of our dataset as
well as the superiority of our methodology. Code and datasets are available at

*Jiexi Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了Prompt Policy Network (PPN)，一个轻量级强化学习框架，通过自适应策略选择来解决LLM中静态提示方法的效率-准确性权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有静态提示方法（如Zero-Shot、Few-Shot、CoT）在效率和准确性之间存在刚性权衡，高准确性的方法（如Self-Consistency）在简单任务上造成计算浪费，而轻量级方法在复杂输入上表现不佳。

Method: 将自适应策略选择形式化为单步马尔可夫决策过程，使用PPO算法训练PPN，并采用资源显式奖励函数来学习仅在必要时分配成本高昂的推理策略。

Result: 在算术推理基准测试中，PPN在效率-准确性Pareto前沿上实现了优越性能，相比Self-Consistency减少了61.5%的token成本，同时保持竞争力准确性。

Conclusion: 这项工作为成本高效的LLM部署提供了一个系统化、自适应的框架，推进了轻量级优化技术在可扩展和可持续语言模型应用中的设计。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) depends heavily on the chosen
prompting strategy, yet static approaches such as Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, or
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) impose a rigid efficiency-accuracy trade-off. Highly
accurate strategies like Self-Consistency (SC) incur substantial computational
waste on simple tasks, while lightweight methods often fail on complex inputs.
This paper introduces the Prompt Policy Network (PPN), a lightweight
reinforcement learning framework that formalizes adaptive strategy selection as
a single-step Markov Decision Process (MDP). The PPN, trained with Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) and guided by a resource-explicit reward function,
learns to allocate costly reasoning strategies only when necessary. Experiments
on arithmetic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that PPN achieves superior
performance on the efficiency-accuracy Pareto front, delivering up to 61.5%
token cost reduction compared to Self-Consistency while maintaining competitive
accuracy. This work contributes a systematic, adaptive framework for
cost-efficient LLM deployment, advancing the design of lightweight optimization
techniques for scalable and sustainable language model applications.

Motivation: 天气基础模型在天气预报方面表现出色，但其对现代社会天气敏感基础设施的实际价值尚未充分探索。本研究旨在验证这些模型在电网关键气象变量预测中的实用性。

Method: 使用Hydro-Québec资产观测数据（包括输电线路气象站、风电场测风塔和覆冰传感器）对Silurian AI的15亿参数天气基础模型GFT进行微调，生成超本地化的资产级预报。

Result: 在6-72小时预报时效内，定制模型超越了最先进的数值天气预报基准：温度平均绝对误差降低15%，总降水量误差降低35%，风速误差降低15%。最重要的是，实现了rime-ice提前检测的平均精度得分0.72。

Conclusion: 天气基础模型通过少量高保真数据后训练，可以作为下一代电网韧性智能的实用基础，为潜在的灾难性停电事件提供数小时的可操作预警。

Abstract: Weather foundation models (WFMs) have recently set new benchmarks in global
forecast skill, yet their concrete value for the weather-sensitive
infrastructure that powers modern society remains largely unexplored. In this
study, we fine-tune Silurian AI's 1.5B-parameter WFM, Generative Forecasting
Transformer (GFT), on a rich archive of Hydro-Qu\'ebec asset
observations--including transmission-line weather stations, wind-farm met-mast
streams, and icing sensors--to deliver hyper-local, asset-level forecasts for
five grid-critical variables: surface temperature, precipitation, hub-height
wind speed, wind-turbine icing risk, and rime-ice accretion on overhead
conductors. Across 6-72 h lead times, the tailored model surpasses
state-of-the-art NWP benchmarks, trimming temperature mean absolute error (MAE)
by 15%, total-precipitation MAE by 35%, and lowering wind speed MAE by 15%.
Most importantly, it attains an average precision score of 0.72 for day-ahead
rime-ice detection, a capability absent from existing operational systems,
which affords several hours of actionable warning for potentially catastrophic
outage events. These results show that WFMs, when post-trained with small
amounts of high-fidelity, can serve as a practical foundation for
next-generation grid-resilience intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以有效捕捉多模态间的完整协同信息，而协同信息是多模态表示的核心价值所在

Method: InfMasking采用随机掩码策略，在融合时遮挡大部分模态特征，仅保留部分信息来创建具有不同协同模式的表示，并通过互信息最大化来编码全面的协同信息

Result: 在受控实验中验证了InfMasking能有效增强模态间协同信息，在7个大规模真实数据集基准测试中达到最先进性能

Conclusion: InfMasking通过无限掩码策略成功解决了多模态表示学习中协同信息提取的挑战，为多模态学习提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: In multimodal representation learning, synergistic interactions between
modalities not only provide complementary information but also create unique
outcomes through specific interaction patterns that no single modality could
achieve alone. Existing methods may struggle to effectively capture the full
spectrum of synergistic information, leading to suboptimal performance in tasks
where such interactions are critical. This is particularly problematic because
synergistic information constitutes the fundamental value proposition of
multimodal representation. To address this challenge, we introduce InfMasking,
a contrastive synergistic information extraction method designed to enhance
synergistic information through an \textbf{Inf}inite \textbf{Masking} strategy.
InfMasking stochastically occludes most features from each modality during
fusion, preserving only partial information to create representations with
varied synergistic patterns. Unmasked fused representations are then aligned
with masked ones through mutual information maximization to encode
comprehensive synergistic information. This infinite masking strategy enables
capturing richer interactions by exposing the model to diverse partial modality
combinations during training. As computing mutual information estimates with
infinite masking is computationally prohibitive, we derive an InfMasking loss
to approximate this calculation. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate
that InfMasking effectively enhances synergistic information between
modalities. In evaluations on large-scale real-world datasets, InfMasking
achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven benchmarks. Code is released
at https://github.com/brightest66/InfMasking.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAESTRO是一个新颖的多模态学习框架，通过动态跨模态交互、符号化标记和稀疏注意力机制，解决了现有方法在真实世界多模态时间序列中的三个关键限制：单一主模态依赖、成对建模和完整模态观察假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态学习方法在真实世界应用中存在三个主要限制：(1)依赖单一主模态进行对齐，(2)成对建模方式，(3)假设完整模态观察。这些限制阻碍了在多模态时间序列场景中的实际应用，因为主模态先验不明确、模态数量可能很大、传感器故障导致任意缺失观察。

Method: MAESTRO通过动态模态内和跨模态交互、符号化标记和自适应注意力预算构建长多模态序列，使用稀疏跨模态注意力处理，并通过稀疏专家混合机制路由跨模态标记，实现不同模态组合下的黑盒专业化。

Result: 在四个不同应用的数据集上评估，MAESTRO在完整观察下比最佳多模态和多变量方法分别平均提升4%和8%；在部分观察（最多40%模态缺失）下平均提升9%。

Conclusion: MAESTRO的稀疏、模态感知设计在动态时间序列学习中表现出鲁棒性和高效性，解决了真实世界多模态学习的关键挑战。

Abstract: From clinical healthcare to daily living, continuous sensor monitoring across
multiple modalities has shown great promise for real-world intelligent
decision-making but also faces various challenges. In this work, we introduce
MAESTRO, a novel framework that overcomes key limitations of existing
multimodal learning approaches: (1) reliance on a single primary modality for
alignment, (2) pairwise modeling of modalities, and (3) assumption of complete
modality observations. These limitations hinder the applicability of these
approaches in real-world multimodal time-series settings, where primary
modality priors are often unclear, the number of modalities can be large
(making pairwise modeling impractical), and sensor failures often result in
arbitrary missing observations. At its core, MAESTRO facilitates dynamic intra-
and cross-modal interactions based on task relevance, and leverages symbolic
tokenization and adaptive attention budgeting to construct long multimodal
sequences, which are processed via sparse cross-modal attention. The resulting
cross-modal tokens are routed through a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
mechanism, enabling black-box specialization under varying modality
combinations. We evaluate MAESTRO against 10 baselines on four diverse datasets
spanning three applications, and observe average relative improvements of 4%
and 8% over the best existing multimodal and multivariate approaches,
respectively, under complete observations. Under partial observations -- with
up to 40% of missing modalities -- MAESTRO achieves an average 9% improvement.
Further analysis also demonstrates the robustness and efficiency of MAESTRO's
sparse, modality-aware design for learning from dynamic time series.

Abstract: Dynamic resource allocation in heterogeneous wireless networks (HetNets) is
challenging for traditional methods under varying user loads and channel

jointly optimises transmit power, bandwidth, and scheduling via a
multi-objective reward balancing throughput, energy efficiency, and fairness.
Using real base station coordinates, we compare Proximal Policy Optimisation
(PPO) and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) against three

frameworks outperform heuristic algorithms in optimising resource allocation in
dynamic networks. These findings highlight key trade-offs in DRL design for

Abstract: We introduce ClustRecNet - a novel deep learning (DL)-based recommendation
framework for determining the most suitable clustering algorithms for a given
dataset, addressing the long-standing challenge of clustering algorithm
selection in unsupervised learning. To enable supervised learning in this
context, we construct a comprehensive data repository comprising 34,000
synthetic datasets with diverse structural properties. Each of them was
processed using 10 popular clustering algorithms. The resulting clusterings
were assessed via the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) to establish ground truth
labels, used for training and evaluation of our DL model. The proposed network
architecture integrates convolutional, residual, and attention mechanisms to
capture both local and global structural patterns from the input data. This
design supports end-to-end training to learn compact representations of
datasets and enables direct recommendation of the most suitable clustering
algorithm, reducing reliance on handcrafted meta-features and traditional
Cluster Validity Indices (CVIs). Comprehensive experiments across synthetic and
real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our DL model consistently outperforms
conventional CVIs (e.g. Silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, Davies-Bouldin, and
Dunn) as well as state-of-the-art AutoML clustering recommendation approaches
(e.g. ML2DAC, AutoCluster, and AutoML4Clust). Notably, the proposed model
achieves a 0.497 ARI improvement over the Calinski-Harabasz index on synthetic
data and a 15.3% ARI gain over the best-performing AutoML approach on
real-world data.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了LLM在强化学习后训练中的缩放规律，发现在固定计算预算下，大模型少步训练优于小模型多步训练；固定数据量时大模型样本效率更高；数据受限时重复使用高质量数据有效；这些规律在不同模型类型中均稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然预训练阶段LLM的缩放规律已被广泛研究，但强化学习后训练阶段的缩放行为仍不清楚，特别是在数学推理任务上。

Method: 基于54个实验，系统研究模型规模、数据量和计算预算在RL后训练中的交互作用，涵盖不同模型大小和训练设置。

Result: 发现四个关键规律：1)固定计算预算下大模型少步训练更优；2)固定数据量时大模型样本效率更高；3)数据受限时重复使用高质量数据有效；4)这些规律在不同模型类型中稳健。

Conclusion: 为通过RL后训练高效扩展LLM推理能力提供了理论基础和实践指导。

Abstract: While scaling laws for large language models (LLMs) during pre-training have
been extensively studied, their behavior under reinforcement learning (RL)
post-training remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a systematic
empirical investigation of scaling behaviors in RL-based post-training, with a
particular focus on mathematical reasoning. Based on 54 experiments across
diverse model sizes and training settings, we characterize how model scale,
data volume, and computational budget interact to shape performance. Our
analysis leads to four key findings: (1). Under a fixed computational budget,
larger models trained for fewer steps consistently outperform smaller models
trained for more steps. (2). Given a fixed amount of training data, larger
models achieve superior sample efficiency, yielding lower loss. (3). In
data-constrained regimes, repeated reuse of high-quality data proves highly
effective, as final performance is primarily governed by the total number of
optimization steps rather than the uniqueness of samples. (4). These scaling
behaviors are robust across both base and instruction-tuned models, which share
similar learning dynamics (e.g., larger models show faster convergence) even
while differing in absolute accuracy. Collectively, these results provide a
principled foundation and practical guidelines for efficiently scaling the
reasoning capabilities of LLMs through RL post-training.

TL;DR: 提出了LEO-CVAE方法，通过局部熵引导的过采样来解决类别不平衡问题，特别关注边界区域的不确定性样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统过采样方法如SMOTE依赖局部线性插值，常产生不合理的合成样本；而深度生成模型如CVAE虽然能更好捕捉非线性分布，但忽视了边界区域不确定样本的重要性。

Method: LEO-CVAE通过计算样本邻域中的香农熵来量化不确定性，采用局部熵加权损失强调不确定区域的鲁棒学习，并使用熵引导的采样策略在信息丰富的类重叠区域集中生成样本。

Result: 在临床基因组数据集（ADNI和TCGA肺癌）上的实验表明，LEO-CVAE持续提升分类器性能，优于传统过采样方法和生成基线方法。

Conclusion: 结果表明，在受复杂非线性结构（如组学数据）支配的领域中，不确定性感知的生成过采样对不平衡学习具有重要价值。

Abstract: Class imbalance remains a major challenge in machine learning, especially for
high-dimensional biomedical data where nonlinear manifold structures dominate.
Traditional oversampling methods such as SMOTE rely on local linear
interpolation, often producing implausible synthetic samples. Deep generative
models like Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAEs) better capture
nonlinear distributions, but standard variants treat all minority samples
equally, neglecting the importance of uncertain, boundary-region examples
emphasized by heuristic methods like Borderline-SMOTE and ADASYN.
  We propose Local Entropy-Guided Oversampling with a CVAE (LEO-CVAE), a
generative oversampling framework that explicitly incorporates local
uncertainty into both representation learning and data generation. To quantify
uncertainty, we compute Shannon entropy over the class distribution in a
sample's neighborhood: high entropy indicates greater class overlap, serving as
a proxy for uncertainty. LEO-CVAE leverages this signal through two mechanisms:
(i) a Local Entropy-Weighted Loss (LEWL) that emphasizes robust learning in
uncertain regions, and (ii) an entropy-guided sampling strategy that
concentrates generation in these informative, class-overlapping areas.
  Applied to clinical genomics datasets (ADNI and TCGA lung cancer), LEO-CVAE
consistently improves classifier performance, outperforming both traditional
oversampling and generative baselines. These results highlight the value of
uncertainty-aware generative oversampling for imbalanced learning in domains
governed by complex nonlinear structures, such as omics data.

TL;DR: 论文研究了矩阵分解中梯度下降在大步长下的分形结构，推导了标量-向量分解的临界步长，并发现正则化会放大初始化的敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索梯度下降在矩阵分解问题中，当步长接近临界值时产生的混沌动力学行为及其对优化结果的影响。

Method: 通过理论分析推导标量-向量分解的临界步长，研究正则化对初始化敏感性的影响，并将分析扩展到正交初始化的通用矩阵分解。

Result: 发现临界步长附近会产生分形边界，梯度下降进入混沌状态，长期动态不可预测，且不存在简单的隐式偏好。

Conclusion: 大步长梯度下降在矩阵分解中会产生混沌动力学，破坏传统的隐式偏好假设，对优化算法的稳定性提出挑战。

Abstract: We examine gradient descent in matrix factorization and show that under large
step sizes the parameter space develops a fractal structure. We derive the
exact critical step size for convergence in scalar-vector factorization and
show that near criticality the selected minimizer depends sensitively on the
initialization. Moreover, we show that adding regularization amplifies this
sensitivity, generating a fractal boundary between initializations that
converge and those that diverge. The analysis extends to general matrix
factorization with orthogonal initialization. Our findings reveal that
near-critical step sizes induce a chaotic regime of gradient descent where the
long-term dynamics are unpredictable and there are no simple implicit biases,
such as towards balancedness, minimum norm, or flatness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究主动相关聚类问题，其中成对相似度不是预先提供的，需要通过主动学习以成本效益的方式查询。特别关注冷启动场景，即没有真实的初始成对相似度可用于主动学习。

Method: 提出了一种覆盖感知方法，在过程早期鼓励多样性，以应对冷启动挑战。

Result: 通过多个合成和真实世界实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 覆盖感知方法在主动相关聚类的冷启动场景中表现出良好的效果。

Abstract: We study active correlation clustering where pairwise similarities are not
provided upfront and must be queried in a cost-efficient manner through active
learning. Specifically, we focus on the cold-start scenario, where no true
initial pairwise similarities are available for active learning. To address
this challenge, we propose a coverage-aware method that encourages diversity
early in the process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through
several synthetic and real-world experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散生成模型在蛋白质设计中忽视了蛋白质的物理真实性，其噪声动态缺乏物理原理基础。

Method: 首先引入基于经典物理的非线性噪声过程，将蛋白质展开为二级结构并保持拓扑完整性；然后与SE(3)流匹配范式集成，结合序列信息进行序列条件折叠。

Conclusion: 提出的物理驱动方法能够生成更真实、设计性更强的蛋白质结构，为蛋白质设计领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Protein structure prediction and folding are fundamental to understanding
biology, with recent deep learning advances reshaping the field.
Diffusion-based generative models have revolutionized protein design, enabling
the creation of novel proteins. However, these methods often neglect the
intrinsic physical realism of proteins, driven by noising dynamics that lack
grounding in physical principles. To address this, we first introduce a
physically motivated non-linear noising process, grounded in classical physics,
that unfolds proteins into secondary structures (e.g., alpha helices, linear
beta sheets) while preserving topological integrity--maintaining bonds, and
preventing collisions. We then integrate this process with the flow-matching
paradigm on SE(3) to model the invariant distribution of protein backbones with
high fidelity, incorporating sequence information to enable
sequence-conditioned folding and expand the generative capabilities of our
model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in unconditional protein generation, producing
more designable and novel protein structures while accurately folding monomer
sequences into precise protein conformations.

TL;DR: 提出基于TD-MPC2世界模型的自主血管内导航方法，在10个真实患者血管中训练单一RL智能体，相比SAC方法成功率从37%提升至65%，但手术时间有所增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机械取栓术的自主导航面临血管解剖复杂性和实时决策精确性的挑战，现有RL方法在多患者血管泛化和长时程任务方面存在困难。

Method: 使用TD-MPC2模型基RL算法构建世界模型，在10个真实患者血管解剖结构中训练单一智能体进行多任务血管内导航学习。

Result: TD-MPC2在多任务学习中显著优于SAC，平均成功率65% vs 37%，路径比率有明显改善，但手术时间增加。

Conclusion: 世界模型在改善自主血管内导航方面具有潜力，为未来可泛化的AI驱动机器人介入研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Autonomous navigation for mechanical thrombectomy (MT) remains a critical
challenge due to the complexity of vascular anatomy and the need for precise,
real-time decision-making. Reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches have
demonstrated potential in automating endovascular navigation, but current
methods often struggle with generalization across multiple patient vasculatures
and long-horizon tasks. We propose a world model for autonomous endovascular
navigation using TD-MPC2, a model-based RL algorithm. We trained a single RL
agent across multiple endovascular navigation tasks in ten real patient
vasculatures, comparing performance against the state-of-the-art Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC) method. Results indicate that TD-MPC2 significantly
outperforms SAC in multi-task learning, achieving a 65% mean success rate
compared to SAC's 37%, with notable improvements in path ratio. TD-MPC2
exhibited increased procedure times, suggesting a trade-off between success
rate and execution speed. These findings highlight the potential of world
models for improving autonomous endovascular navigation and lay the foundation
for future research in generalizable AI-driven robotic interventions.

TL;DR: 提出了训练重评估曲线(TREC)方法，用于分析模型在训练过程中对数据的保留情况，并发现将高质量数据放在TREC的低点能显著提升性能。TREC可以通过AdamW的隐式EMA系数提前预测，从而优化数据课程设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM训练中数据课程设计至关重要，但缺乏明确的数据放置原则。需要一种方法来诊断和优化训练过程中数据的使用效率。

Method: 引入训练重评估曲线(TREC)，使用最终模型权重回顾性评估训练批次，分析模型对训练数据的保留情况与训练时间的关系。利用AdamW的隐式EMA系数预测TREC。

Result: 在111M到3.9B参数的模型上验证，将高质量数据放置在TREC低点能显著提升性能。成功预测了已发布训练方案中的TREC，解释了先前的消融实验结果并揭示了次优数据放置。

Conclusion: TREC为数据课程设计提供了有效工具，通过预测和优化数据放置位置，能够显著提升LLM训练效率和性能。

Abstract: Data curriculums have become central to successful LLM training, yet
principles governing optimal data placement remain unclear. We introduce the
*training re-evaluation curve (TREC)*, a diagnostic that retrospectively
evaluates training batches *using the final model weights*. The TREC
characterizes how well a trained model retains training data as a function of
*when* the data was encountered during training. Analyzing TRECs for models
from 111M to 3.9B parameters, we show that placing high-quality data at low
points on the TREC significantly improves performance. Importantly, while a
TREC is initially observable only after training, we demonstrate it can be
*predicted in advance* from AdamW's implicit EMA coefficients, enabling
proactive curriculum design. By predicting TRECs for published training
recipes, we explain prior ablations and reveal suboptimal data placements. We
also align high-quality data with TREC minima in order to improve continual
pre-training of a 3.9B-parameter LLM trained on 900B tokens.

TL;DR: 提出了FCRN框架，这是一个用于竞争风险下离散时间生存分析的深度学习模型，能够整合功能协变量并处理缺失数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在重症监护等场景中，需要同时处理功能协变量、缺失数据和竞争风险，现有方法难以有效整合这些要素。

Method: 结合微网络基函数层和基于梯度的插补模块，端到端学习缺失值插补和事件特定风险预测。

Result: 在模拟数据集和真实ICU案例研究中，FCRN相比随机生存森林和传统竞争风险模型，预测准确性显著提升。

Conclusion: FCRN通过有效捕捉动态风险因素和静态预测因子，同时处理不规则和不完整数据，推进了重症监护的预后建模。

Abstract: We introduce the Functional Competing Risk Net (FCRN), a unified
deep-learning framework for discrete-time survival analysis under competing
risks, which seamlessly integrates functional covariates and handles missing
data within an end-to-end model. By combining a micro-network Basis Layer for
functional data representation with a gradient-based imputation module, FCRN
simultaneously learns to impute missing values and predict event-specific
hazards. Evaluated on multiple simulated datasets and a real-world ICU case
study using the MIMIC-IV and Cleveland Clinic datasets, FCRN demonstrates
substantial improvements in prediction accuracy over random survival forests
and traditional competing risks models. This approach advances prognostic
modeling in critical care by more effectively capturing dynamic risk factors
and static predictors while accommodating irregular and incomplete data.

Motivation: 评估生成模型在潜在空间中是否真正捕捉到数据的底层结构，特别是当模型表现出强大去噪性能时。

Method: 使用哈密顿蒙特卡洛从干净输入中抽取后验样本，并与从噪声数据编码器输出进行比较。

Result: 模型能准确重建信号，但统计比较显示潜在空间存在明显不匹配。

Conclusion: 强大的去噪性能不一定意味着潜在表示可靠，强调了使用基于后验验证方法评估生成模型的重要性。

Abstract: In this work, we explore the latent space of a denoising variational
autoencoder with a mixture-of-Gaussians prior (VAE-MoG), trained on
gravitational wave data from event GW150914. To evaluate how well the model
captures the underlying structure, we use Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) to draw
posterior samples conditioned on clean inputs, and compare them to the
encoder's outputs from noisy data. Although the model reconstructs signals
accurately, statistical comparisons reveal a clear mismatch in the latent
space. This shows that strong denoising performance doesn't necessarily mean
the latent representations are reliable highlighting the importance of using
posterior-based validation when evaluating generative models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统众包依赖人工标注，而该框架旨在利用多个聚类算法输出作为噪声标注进行集成，在真实数据结构未知时提供稳健的聚类解决方案。

Method: 采用Dawid-Skene模型框架，将不同聚类算法的结果建模为噪声标注，通过集成方法聚合这些预测。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集上的实验表明，mixsemble虽不总是最佳性能，但能稳定接近最优结果并避免较差表现。

Conclusion: mixsemble在数据结构未知时具有稳健性，为非专业用户提供了实用的聚类替代方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces mixsemble, an ensemble method that adapts the
Dawid-Skene model to aggregate predictions from multiple model-based clustering
algorithms. Unlike traditional crowdsourcing, which relies on human labels, the
framework models the outputs of clustering algorithms as noisy annotations.
Experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets show that, although the
mixsemble is not always the single top performer, it consistently approaches
the best result and avoids poor outcomes. This robustness makes it a practical
alternative when the true data structure is unknown, especially for non-expert
users.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于多任务学习的贝叶斯相关向量机方法，用于提高方程发现在不同操作条件下的泛化能力，避免过拟合特定数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 方程发现在系统识别中面临的主要挑战是确保识别模型能够泛化到不同操作条件，而不仅仅是过拟合特定数据集。特别是在结构健康监测中，不同载荷条件会揭示系统物理的不同方面。

Method: 采用贝叶斯相关向量机（RVM）在多任务学习框架下进行参数识别，将同一结构在不同激励水平下的响应视为相关任务，共享模型参数但保留任务特定的噪声特性。

Result: 在单自由度振荡器案例研究中，标准单任务RVM模型能够重现系统响应，但在激励不足以激发非线性动力学时无法恢复真实控制项。相比之下，MTL-RVM通过跨任务组合信息，改善了弱和中等激励数据集下的参数恢复，同时在高激励下保持强性能。

Conclusion: 多任务贝叶斯推断可以减轻方程发现中的过拟合问题并促进泛化能力，特别适用于结构健康监测中变化载荷条件揭示系统物理互补方面的情况。

Abstract: Equation discovery provides a grey-box approach to system identification by
uncovering governing dynamics directly from observed data. However, a
persistent challenge lies in ensuring that identified models generalise across
operating conditions rather than over-fitting to specific datasets. This work
investigates this issue by applying a Bayesian relevance vector machine (RVM)
within a multi-task learning (MTL) framework for simultaneous parameter
identification across multiple datasets. In this formulation, responses from
the same structure under different excitation levels are treated as related
tasks that share model parameters but retain task-specific noise
characteristics. A simulated single degree-of-freedom oscillator with linear
and cubic stiffness provided the case study, with datasets generated under
three excitation regimes. Standard single-task RVM models were able to
reproduce system responses but often failed to recover the true governing terms
when excitations insufficiently stimulated non-linear dynamics. By contrast,
the MTL-RVM combined information across tasks, improving parameter recovery for
weakly and moderately excited datasets, while maintaining strong performance
under high excitation. These findings demonstrate that multi-task Bayesian
inference can mitigate over-fitting and promote generalisation in equation
discovery. The approach is particularly relevant to structural health
monitoring, where varying load conditions reveal complementary aspects of
system physics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlashOmni是一个统一的稀疏注意力引擎，通过灵活的稀疏符号标准化多种稀疏策略表示，在单个注意力内核中执行多样化稀疏计算，显著加速多模态扩散变换器推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态扩散变换器(DiTs)在视觉合成方面表现出色，但计算需求大限制了部署。现有的稀疏加速方法需要定制化内核，缺乏通用性。

Method: 提出FlashOmni统一引擎，引入灵活稀疏符号标准化稀疏策略表示，设计优化的稀疏GEMMs消除冗余计算。

Result: FlashOmni在注意力和GEMM-Q中实现接近线性的加速比(1:1)，在GEMM-O中实现2.5-3.8倍加速，达到理论极限的87.5%。应用多粒度稀疏策略使Hunyuan模型(33K)实现约1.5倍端到端加速且不降低视觉质量。

Conclusion: FlashOmni提供了一个通用的稀疏注意力解决方案，能够有效加速DiT模型推理，同时保持视觉质量。

Abstract: Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) demonstrate exceptional
capabilities in visual synthesis, yet their deployment remains constrained by
substantial computational demands. To alleviate this bottleneck, many
sparsity-based acceleration methods have been proposed. However, their diverse
sparsity patterns often require customized kernels for high-performance
inference, limiting universality. We propose FlashOmni, a unified sparse
attention engine compatible with arbitrary DiT architectures. FlashOmni
introduces flexible sparse symbols to standardize the representation of a wide
range of sparsity strategies, such as feature caching and block-sparse
skipping. This unified abstraction enables the execution of diverse sparse
computations within a single attention kernel. In addition, FlashOmni designs
optimized sparse GEMMs for attention blocks, leveraging sparse symbols to
eliminate redundant computations and further improve efficiency. Experiments
demonstrate that FlashOmni delivers near-linear, closely matching the sparsity
ratio speedup (1:1) in attention and GEMM-$Q$, and achieves
2.5$\times$-3.8$\times$ acceleration in GEMM-$O$ (max peaking at about 87.5% of
the theoretical limit). Applied with a multi-granularity sparsity strategy, it
enables the Hunyuan model (33K) to achieve about 1.5$\times$ end-to-end
acceleration without degrading visual quality.

TL;DR: B2R框架通过非对称条件处理和成本信号重对齐，解决了离线安全强化学习中对称输入标记处理导致的约束不可靠问题，在38个安全关键任务中35个满足安全约束且奖励性能优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于序列模型的方法对回报到目标(RTG)和成本到目标(CTG)使用对称输入标记处理，忽略了它们内在的不对称性：RTG是灵活性能目标，而CTG应是刚性安全边界。这种对称处理导致约束满足不可靠，特别是在遇到分布外成本轨迹时。

Method: 提出Boundary-to-Region (B2R)框架，通过成本信号重对齐实现非对称条件处理。B2R将CTG重新定义为固定安全预算下的边界约束，统一所有可行轨迹的成本分布同时保留奖励结构。结合旋转位置嵌入，增强安全区域内的探索能力。

Result: 实验结果显示，B2R在38个安全关键任务中的35个满足安全约束，同时在奖励性能上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了对称标记条件处理的局限性，为将序列模型应用于安全RL建立了新的理论和实践方法。

Abstract: Offline safe reinforcement learning aims to learn policies that satisfy
predefined safety constraints from static datasets. Existing
sequence-model-based methods condition action generation on symmetric input
tokens for return-to-go and cost-to-go, neglecting their intrinsic asymmetry:
return-to-go (RTG) serves as a flexible performance target, while cost-to-go
(CTG) should represent a rigid safety boundary. This symmetric conditioning
leads to unreliable constraint satisfaction, especially when encountering
out-of-distribution cost trajectories. To address this, we propose
Boundary-to-Region (B2R), a framework that enables asymmetric conditioning
through cost signal realignment . B2R redefines CTG as a boundary constraint
under a fixed safety budget, unifying the cost distribution of all feasible
trajectories while preserving reward structures. Combined with rotary
positional embeddings , it enhances exploration within the safe region.
Experimental results show that B2R satisfies safety constraints in 35 out of 38
safety-critical tasks while achieving superior reward performance over baseline
methods. This work highlights the limitations of symmetric token conditioning
and establishes a new theoretical and practical approach for applying sequence
models to safe RL. Our code is available at https://github.com/HuikangSu/B2R.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视多LoRA适配器中A矩阵高度相似的现象，发现这种相似性主要源于相同的初始化而非共享知识，而B矩阵在知识编码和传递中起更关键作用。

Method: 提出ALoRA（多任务微调中使用多个A矩阵和单个共享B矩阵）和Fed-ALoRA（联邦学习中跨客户端共享B矩阵），采用新颖的矩阵分解策略处理异构秩问题。

Result: 在常识推理、数学推理、多任务NLP数据集和联邦NLP数据集上的实验表明，相比现有多LoRA方法，我们的方法在保持相当或更优平均准确率的同时，实现了更平衡的任务性能。

Conclusion: ALoRA和Fed-ALoRA通过非对称多LoRA设计和B矩阵共享，有效提升了多任务和联邦学习场景下的性能平衡性和效率。

Abstract: Large language models are often adapted using parameter-efficient techniques
such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), formulated as $y = W_0x + BAx$, where $W_0$
is the pre-trained parameters and $x$ is the input to the adapted layer. While
multi-adapter extensions often employ multiple LoRAs, prior studies suggest
that the inner $A$ matrices are highly similar during training and thus
suitable for sharing. We revisit this phenomenon and find that this similarity
is largely attributable to the identical initialization rather than shared
knowledge, with $B$ playing a more critical role in knowledge encoding and
transfer. Motivated by these insights, we propose \textbf{ALoRA}, an asymmetric
multi-LoRA design with multiple $A$ matrices and a single shared $B$ in
multi-task fine-tuning, and \textbf{Fed-ALoRA}, which shares $B$ across clients
in federated fine-tuning under both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings,
through a novel matrix decomposition strategy to accommodate heterogeneous
ranks across clients. Experiments on commonsense reasoning, math reasoning,
multi-task NLP dataset, and federated NLP dataset demonstrate that our methods
achieve more balanced performance across tasks with comparable or superior
average accuracy relative to existing multi-LoRA approaches. Codes are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时序图神经网络攻击方法依赖简单扰动且容易被检测，无法有效针对关键节点和边进行攻击，需要开发更隐蔽高效的攻击方法来暴露TGNN的脆弱性。

Method: 使用数据驱动的代理模型识别结构重要节点和动态重要节点，采用混合扰动策略（边注入和边删除），最小化扰动数量以提高隐蔽性。

Result: 在5个真实数据集和4种TGNN架构上的实验表明，HIA显著降低了链接预测任务的准确性，MRR最多下降35.55%，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 结果揭示了当前STDG模型的基本脆弱性，强调了开发同时考虑结构和时间动态的鲁棒防御的紧迫需求。

Abstract: Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have become indispensable for
analyzing dynamic graphs in critical applications such as social networks,
communication systems, and financial networks. However, the robustness of TGNNs
against adversarial attacks, particularly sophisticated attacks that exploit
the temporal dimension, remains a significant challenge. Existing attack
methods for Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Graphs (STDGs) often rely on simplistic,
easily detectable perturbations (e.g., random edge additions/deletions) and
fail to strategically target the most influential nodes and edges for maximum
impact. We introduce the High Impact Attack (HIA), a novel restricted black-box
attack framework specifically designed to overcome these limitations and expose
critical vulnerabilities in TGNNs. HIA leverages a data-driven surrogate model
to identify structurally important nodes (central to network connectivity) and
dynamically important nodes (critical for the graph's temporal evolution). It
then employs a hybrid perturbation strategy, combining strategic edge injection
(to create misleading connections) and targeted edge deletion (to disrupt
essential pathways), maximizing TGNN performance degradation. Importantly, HIA
minimizes the number of perturbations to enhance stealth, making it more
challenging to detect. Comprehensive experiments on five real-world datasets
and four representative TGNN architectures (TGN, JODIE, DySAT, and TGAT)
demonstrate that HIA significantly reduces TGNN accuracy on the link prediction
task, achieving up to a 35.55% decrease in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) - a
substantial improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. These results
highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in current STDG models and underscore the
urgent need for robust defenses that account for both structural and temporal
dynamics.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning fine-tuning (RLFT) is a dominant paradigm for
improving pretrained policies for downstream tasks. These pretrained policies,
trained on large datasets, produce generations with a broad range of promising
but unrefined behaviors. Often, a critical failure mode of RLFT arises when
policies lose this diversity and collapse into a handful of easily exploitable
outputs. This convergence hinders exploration, which is essential for expanding
the capabilities of the pretrained policy and for amplifying the benefits of
test-time compute scaling. To address this, we introduce an objective for
policy gradient methods that explicitly enforces the exploration and refinement
of diverse generations, which we call a polychromic objective. We then show how
proximal policy optimization (PPO) can be adapted to optimize this objective.
Our method (1) employs vine sampling to collect on-policy rollouts and (2)
modifies the advantage function to reflect the advantage under our new
objective. Experiments on BabyAI, Minigrid, and Algorithmic Creativity show
that our method improves success rates by reliably solving a larger set of
environment configurations and generalizes better under large perturbations.
Moreover, when given multiple attempts in pass@$k$ experiments, the policy
achieves substantially higher coverage, demonstrating its ability to maintain
and exploit a diverse repertoire of strategies.

### [270] [Beyond Noisy-TVs: Noise-Robust Exploration Via Learning Progress Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25438)
*Zhibo Hou,Zhiyu An,Wan Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为学习进度监控(LPM)的新方法，通过奖励模型改进而非预测误差或新颖性来引导探索，有效避免在不可学习的随机噪声源(noisy-TV)上停滞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于内在奖励的探索方法在面对环境中的不可学习随机噪声源时容易陷入停滞，而基于不确定性估计或分布相似性的方法虽然最终能逃脱，但样本效率低且计算成本高。受神经科学发现人类在探索过程中监控自身改进的启发，提出LPM方法。

Method: 采用双网络设计：使用误差模型预测动态模型在先前迭代中的预期预测误差，利用当前迭代与先前迭代模型误差的差异来指导探索。理论证明LPM的内在奖励具有零等变性，是信息增益的单调指标。

Result: 在基于MNIST、3D迷宫和Atari的噪声环境中与最先进基线比较，LPM的内在奖励收敛更快，在迷宫实验中探索更多状态，在Atari中获得更高的外在奖励。

Conclusion: 这种概念简单的方法标志着噪声鲁棒探索的范式转变，通过监控学习进度而非预测误差来有效解决noisy-TV问题。

Abstract: When there exists an unlearnable source of randomness (noisy-TV) in the
environment, a naively intrinsic reward driven exploring agent gets stuck at
that source of randomness and fails at exploration. Intrinsic reward based on
uncertainty estimation or distribution similarity, while eventually escapes
noisy-TVs as time unfolds, suffers from poor sample efficiency and high
computational cost. Inspired by recent findings from neuroscience that humans
monitor their improvements during exploration, we propose a novel method for
intrinsically-motivated exploration, named Learning Progress Monitoring (LPM).
During exploration, LPM rewards model improvements instead of prediction error
or novelty, effectively rewards the agent for observing learnable transitions
rather than the unlearnable transitions. We introduce a dual-network design
that uses an error model to predict the expected prediction error of the
dynamics model in its previous iteration, and use the difference between the
model errors of the current iteration and previous iteration to guide
exploration. We theoretically show that the intrinsic reward of LPM is
zero-equivariant and a monotone indicator of Information Gain (IG), and that
the error model is necessary to achieve monotonicity correspondence with IG. We
empirically compared LPM against state-of-the-art baselines in noisy
environments based on MNIST, 3D maze with 160x120 RGB inputs, and Atari.
Results show that LPM's intrinsic reward converges faster, explores more states
in the maze experiment, and achieves higher extrinsic reward in Atari. This
conceptually simple approach marks a shift-of-paradigm of noise-robust
exploration. For code to reproduce our experiments, see

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has seen great success recently in unsupervised
representation learning, enabling breakthroughs in natural language and image
processing. However, these methods often rely on autoregressive and masked
modeling, which aim to reproduce masked information in the input, which can be
vulnerable to the presence of noise or confounding variables. To address this
problem, Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA) has been introduced
with the aim to perform self-supervised learning in the latent space. To
leverage these advancements in the domain of time series, we introduce Time
Series JEPA (TS-JEPA), an architecture specifically adapted for time series
representation learning. We validate TS-JEPA on both classification and
forecasting, showing that it can match or surpass current state-of-the-art
baselines on different standard datasets. Notably, our approach demonstrates a
strong performance balance across diverse tasks, indicating its potential as a
robust foundation for learning general representations. Thus, this work lays
the groundwork for developing future time series foundation models based on
Joint Embedding.

Abstract: Generalist robot policies that can perform many tasks typically require
extensive expert data or simulations for training. In this work, we propose a
novel Data-Efficient multitask DAgger framework that distills a single
multitask policy from multiple task-specific expert policies. Our approach
significantly increases the overall task success rate by actively focusing on
tasks where the multitask policy underperforms. The core of our method is a
performance-aware scheduling strategy that tracks how much each task's learning
process benefits from the amount of data, using a Kalman filter-based estimator
to robustly decide how to allocate additional demonstrations across tasks. We
validate our approach on MetaWorld, as well as a suite of diverse
drawer-opening tasks in IsaacLab. The resulting policy attains high performance
across all tasks while using substantially fewer expert demonstrations, and the
visual policy learned with our method in simulation shows better performance
than naive DAgger and Behavior Cloning when transferring zero-shot to a real
robot without using real data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有信号时序逻辑推理方法缺乏对推断规则的正式置信保证，而传统的共形预测通常作为训练后包装器使用，无法改进模型学习。

Method: 引入基于鲁棒性的非共形分数，在训练中直接嵌入平滑共形预测层，使用新的损失函数同时优化推理准确性和共形预测集。

Result: 在基准时序任务上的实验表明，该方法减少了预测不确定性（实现高覆盖率同时减小预测集大小），并提高了准确性（使用固定阈值时的误分类数量减少）。

Conclusion: 该端到端可微分共形预测框架显著提升了信号时序逻辑推理的可靠性和可解释性，为学习到的公式提供统计保证。

Abstract: Signal Temporal Logic (STL) inference seeks to extract human-interpretable
rules from time-series data, but existing methods lack formal confidence
guarantees for the inferred rules. Conformal prediction (CP) is a technique
that can provide statistical correctness guarantees, but is typically applied
as a post-training wrapper without improving model learning. Instead, we
introduce an end-to-end differentiable CP framework for STL inference that
enhances both reliability and interpretability of the resulting formulas. We
introduce a robustness-based nonconformity score, embed a smooth CP layer
directly into training, and employ a new loss function that simultaneously
optimizes inference accuracy and CP prediction sets with a single term.
Following training, an exact CP procedure delivers statistical guarantees for
the learned STL formulas. Experiments on benchmark time-series tasks show that
our approach reduces uncertainty in predictions (i.e., it achieves high
coverage while reducing prediction set size), and improves accuracy (i.e., the
number of misclassifications when using a fixed threshold) over
state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: P2Es是一个基于扩散模型的框架，能够从PPG信号生成临床有效的12导联心电图，通过频域模糊和时域噪声干扰模拟真实信号失真，并利用KNN聚类和对比学习实现人口统计学特定的ECG转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的12导联ECG系统依赖繁琐的多电极设置，限制了动态监测应用，而当前基于PPG的方法由于缺乏导联间约束和时空依赖性建模不足，无法重建多导联ECG。

Method: 提出P2Es框架，包含前向过程的频域模糊和时域噪声干扰，反向过程的时域多尺度生成和频域去模糊，以及基于KNN聚类和对比学习的亲和矩阵分配。

Result: 广泛的实验结果表明，P2Es在12导联ECG重建方面优于基线模型。

Conclusion: P2Es通过创新的扩散框架成功实现了从PPG信号到临床有效12导联ECG的转换，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is the gold standard for cardiovascular
monitoring, offering superior diagnostic granularity and specificity compared
to photoplethysmography (PPG). However, existing 12-lead ECG systems rely on
cumbersome multi-electrode setups, limiting sustained monitoring in ambulatory
settings, while current PPG-based methods fail to reconstruct multi-lead ECG
due to the absence of inter-lead constraints and insufficient modeling of
spatial-temporal dependencies across leads. To bridge this gap, we introduce
P2Es, an innovative demographic-aware diffusion framework designed to generate
clinically valid 12-lead ECG from PPG signals via three key innovations.
Specifically, in the forward process, we introduce frequency-domain blurring
followed by temporal noise interference to simulate real-world signal
distortions. In the reverse process, we design a temporal multi-scale
generation module followed by frequency deblurring. In particular, we leverage
KNN-based clustering combined with contrastive learning to assign affinity
matrices for the reverse process, enabling demographic-specific ECG
translation. Extensive experimental results show that P2Es outperforms baseline
models in 12-lead ECG reconstruction.

TL;DR: PageANN是一个基于磁盘的近似最近邻搜索框架，通过页面节点图结构对齐逻辑节点与物理SSD页面，缩短I/O遍历路径并减少I/O操作，显著提升了大规模向量搜索的性能和可扩展性。


<details>

Conclusion: PageANN通过创新的页面节点图结构和优化的内存管理策略，有效解决了磁盘ANNS的性能瓶颈，为大规模向量搜索提供了高效可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS), as the core of vector databases
(VectorDBs), has become widely used in modern AI and ML systems, powering
applications from information retrieval to bio-informatics. While graph-based
ANNS methods achieve high query efficiency, their scalability is constrained by
the available host memory. Recent disk-based ANNS approaches mitigate memory
usage by offloading data to Solid-State Drives (SSDs). However, they still
suffer from issues such as long I/O traversal path, misalignment with storage
I/O granularity, and high in-memory indexing overhead, leading to significant
I/O latency and ultimately limiting scalability for large-scale vector search.
  In this paper, we propose PageANN, a disk-based approximate nearest neighbor
search (ANNS) framework designed for high performance and scalability. PageANN
introduces a page-node graph structure that aligns logical graph nodes with
physical SSD pages, thereby shortening I/O traversal paths and reducing I/O
operations. Specifically, similar vectors are clustered into page nodes, and a
co-designed disk data layout leverages this structure with a merging technique
to store only representative vectors and topology information, avoiding
unnecessary reads. To further improve efficiency, we design a memory management
strategy that combines lightweight indexing with coordinated memory-disk data
allocation, maximizing host memory utilization while minimizing query latency
and storage overhead. Experimental results show that PageANN significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) disk-based ANNS methods, achieving
1.85x-10.83x higher throughput and 51.7%-91.9% lower latency across different
datasets and memory budgets, while maintaining comparable high recall accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分子基础模型在分布外样本上不可靠，存在化学幻觉问题，限制了在药物发现等高风险领域的应用

Method: 将OOD检测问题构建为对ID和OOD样本间OOD亲和度的偏好优化，通过成对学习目标实现，本质上优化AUROC指标

Result: 在五个真实分子数据集上，对现有分子基础模型的OOD检测能力有显著提升，在尺寸、支架和检测分布偏移下AUROC分别提升45.8%、43.9%和24.3%

Conclusion: Mole-PAIR是一个简单即插即用的模块，能有效提升分子基础模型在OOD数据上的可靠性

Abstract: Molecular foundation models are rapidly advancing scientific discovery, but
their unreliability on out-of-distribution (OOD) samples severely limits their
application in high-stakes domains such as drug discovery and protein design. A
critical failure mode is chemical hallucination, where models make
high-confidence yet entirely incorrect predictions for unknown molecules. To
address this challenge, we introduce Molecular Preference-Aligned Instance
Ranking (Mole-PAIR), a simple, plug-and-play module that can be flexibly
integrated with existing foundation models to improve their reliability on OOD
data through cost-effective post-training. Specifically, our method formulates
the OOD detection problem as a preference optimization over the estimated OOD
affinity between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples, achieving this goal
through a pairwise learning objective. We show that this objective essentially
optimizes AUROC, which measures how consistently ID and OOD samples are ranked
by the model. Extensive experiments across five real-world molecular datasets
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the OOD detection
capabilities of existing molecular foundation models, achieving up to 45.8%,
43.9%, and 24.3% improvements in AUROC under distribution shifts of size,
scaffold, and assay, respectively.

Conclusion: 基于LLM的AI代理能够有效自动化晶体管尺寸优化过程，减少人工干预，并在先进技术节点上表现出良好的性能。

Abstract: The design of Analog and Mixed-Signal (AMS) integrated circuits (ICs) often
involves significant manual effort, especially during the transistor sizing
process. While Machine Learning techniques in Electronic Design Automation
(EDA) have shown promise in reducing complexity and minimizing human
intervention, they still face challenges such as numerous iterations and a lack
of knowledge about AMS circuit design. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs)
have demonstrated significant potential across various fields, showing a
certain level of knowledge in circuit design and indicating their potential to
automate the transistor sizing process. In this work, we propose EEsizer, an
LLM-based AI agent that integrates large language models with circuit
simulators and custom data analysis functions, enabling fully automated,
closed-loop transistor sizing without relying on external knowledge. By
employing prompt engineering and Chain-of-Thought reasoning, the agent
iteratively explores design directions, evaluates performance, and refines
solutions with minimal human intervention. We first benchmarked 8 LLMs on six
basic circuits and selected three high-performing models to optimize a
20-transistor CMOS operational amplifier, targeting multiple performance
metrics, including rail-to-rail operation from 180 nm to 90 nm technology
nodes. Notably, OpenAI o3 successfully achieved the user-intended target at 90
nm across three different test groups, with a maximum of 20 iterations,
demonstrating adaptability and robustness at advanced nodes. To assess design
robustness, we manually designed a bias circuit and performed a variation
analysis using Gaussian-distributed variations on transistor dimensions and
threshold voltages.

Conclusion: 半离散流匹配方法有效解决了OT-FM的计算瓶颈，实现了更好的生成性能，为流模型训练提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Flow models parameterized as time-dependent velocity fields can generate data
from noise by integrating an ODE. These models are often trained using flow
matching, i.e. by sampling random pairs of noise and target points
$(\mathbf{x}_0,\mathbf{x}_1)$ and ensuring that the velocity field is aligned,
on average, with $\mathbf{x}_1-\mathbf{x}_0$ when evaluated along a segment
linking $\mathbf{x}_0$ to $\mathbf{x}_1$. While these pairs are sampled
independently by default, they can also be selected more carefully by matching
batches of $n$ noise to $n$ target points using an optimal transport (OT)
solver. Although promising in theory, the OT flow matching (OT-FM) approach is
not widely used in practice. Zhang et al. (2025) pointed out recently that
OT-FM truly starts paying off when the batch size $n$ grows significantly,
which only a multi-GPU implementation of the Sinkhorn algorithm can handle.
Unfortunately, the costs of running Sinkhorn can quickly balloon, requiring
$O(n^2/\varepsilon^2)$ operations for every $n$ pairs used to fit the velocity
field, where $\varepsilon$ is a regularization parameter that should be
typically small to yield better results. To fulfill the theoretical promises of
OT-FM, we propose to move away from batch-OT and rely instead on a semidiscrete
formulation that leverages the fact that the target dataset distribution is
usually of finite size $N$. The SD-OT problem is solved by estimating a dual
potential vector using SGD; using that vector, freshly sampled noise vectors at
train time can then be matched with data points at the cost of a maximum inner
product search (MIPS). Semidiscrete FM (SD-FM) removes the quadratic dependency
on $n/\varepsilon$ that bottlenecks OT-FM. SD-FM beats both FM and OT-FM on all
training metrics and inference budget constraints, across multiple datasets, on
unconditional/conditional generation, or when using mean-flow models.

Conclusion: 通过因果推断视角整合黄金标准和偏好数据，可以有效纠正偏好数据偏差，提高LLM路由器的性能和效率。

Abstract: In language tasks that require extensive human--model interaction, deploying
a single "best" model for every query can be expensive. To reduce inference
cost while preserving the quality of the responses, a large language model
(LLM) router selects the most appropriate model from a pool of candidates for
each query. A central challenge to training a high-quality router is the
scarcity of reliable supervision. Gold-standard data (e.g., expert-verified
labels or rubric-based scores) provide accurate quality evaluations of LLM
responses but are costly and difficult to scale. In contrast, preference-based
data, collected via crowdsourcing or LLM-as-a-judge systems, are cheaper and
more scalable, yet often biased in reflecting the true quality of responses. We
cast the problem of LLM router training with combined gold-standard and
preference-based data into a causal inference framework by viewing the response
evaluation mechanism as the treatment assignment. This perspective further
reveals that the bias in preference-based data corresponds to the well-known
causal estimand: the conditional average treatment effect. Based on this new
perspective, we develop an integrative causal router training framework that
corrects preference-data bias, address imbalances between two data sources, and
improve routing robustness and efficiency. Numerical experiments demonstrate
that our approach delivers more accurate routing and improves the trade-off
between cost and quality.

Abstract: Generative AI poses both opportunities and risks for solving inverse design
problems in the sciences. Generative tools provide the ability to expand and
refine a search space autonomously, but do so at the cost of exploring
low-quality regions until sufficiently fine tuned. Here, we propose a queue
prioritization algorithm that combines generative modeling and active learning
in the context of a distributed workflow for exploring complex design spaces.
We find that incorporating an active learning model to prioritize top design
candidates can prevent a generative AI workflow from expending resources on
nonsensical candidates and halt potential generative model decay. For an
existing generative AI workflow for discovering novel molecular structure
candidates for carbon capture, our active learning approach significantly
increases the number of high-quality candidates identified by the generative
model. We find that, out of 1000 novel candidates, our workflow without active
learning can generate an average of 281 high-performing candidates, while our
proposed prioritization with active learning can generate an average 604
high-performing candidates.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) faces persistent robustness challenges due to non-IID
data distributions and adversarial client behavior. A promising mitigation
strategy is contribution evaluation, which enables adaptive aggregation by
quantifying each client's utility to the global model. However,
state-of-the-art Shapley-value-based approaches incur high computational
overhead due to repeated model reweighting and inference, which limits their
scalability. We propose FedIF, a novel FL aggregation framework that leverages
trajectory-based influence estimation to efficiently compute client
contributions. FedIF adapts decentralized FL by introducing normalized and
smoothed influence scores computed from lightweight gradient operations on
client updates and a public validation set. Theoretical analysis demonstrates
that FedIF yields a tighter bound on one-step global loss change under noisy
conditions. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST show that FedIF
achieves robustness comparable to or exceeding SV-based methods in the presence
of label noise, gradient noise, and adversarial samples, while reducing
aggregation overhead by up to 450x. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness
of FedIF's design choices, including local weight normalization and influence
smoothing. Our results establish FedIF as a practical, theoretically grounded,
and scalable alternative to Shapley-value-based approaches for efficient and
robust FL in real-world deployments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了首个在上下文强化学习(ICRL)框架下促进安全适应的方法，通过约束马尔可夫决策过程确保在无参数更新的适应过程中同时最大化奖励和最小化成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICRL能够在无需参数更新的情况下适应分布外任务，但现有方法缺乏对适应过程安全性的考虑，需要确保智能体在最大化奖励的同时也能控制成本。

Method: 在ICRL框架中引入约束马尔可夫决策过程，使智能体在无参数更新的适应过程中同时优化奖励和成本函数，并能够根据成本容忍度阈值主动调整行为策略。

Result: 智能体能够根据成本预算主动调整行为：成本预算较高时行为更激进，成本预算较低时行为更保守，实现了安全的自适应能力。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将安全性约束集成到ICRL的适应过程中，使智能体能够在不同成本容忍度下实现安全的自适应行为。

Abstract: In-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) is an emerging RL paradigm where the
agent, after some pretraining procedure, is able to adapt to
out-of-distribution test tasks without any parameter updates. The agent
achieves this by continually expanding the input (i.e., the context) to its
policy neural networks. For example, the input could be all the history
experience that the agent has access to until the current time step. The
agent's performance improves as the input grows, without any parameter updates.
In this work, we propose the first method that promotes the safety of ICRL's
adaptation process in the framework of constrained Markov Decision Processes.
In other words, during the parameter-update-free adaptation process, the agent
not only maximizes the reward but also minimizes an additional cost function.
We also demonstrate that our agent actively reacts to the threshold (i.e.,
budget) of the cost tolerance. With a higher cost budget, the agent behaves
more aggressively, and with a lower cost budget, the agent behaves more
conservatively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无导数方法在高维、噪声或混合整数设置中表现不佳，需要更先进的优化技术来应对现实世界中的复杂优化问题。

Method: 使用机器学习和强化学习技术，包括神经网络、贝叶斯优化、扩散模型、元学习和强化学习策略等，构建更强大的黑盒优化框架。

Result: 开发了多种先进算法如mlrMBO、ZO-AdaMM、ABBO、DiBB、SPBOpt、B2Opt等，显著提升了黑盒优化的性能和适用范围。

Conclusion: 机器学习和强化学习将传统的不精确求解器转变为更可扩展、鲁棒和自适应的优化框架，为现实世界优化问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Black-box optimization (BBO) addresses problems where objectives are
accessible only through costly queries without gradients or explicit structure.
Classical derivative-free methods -- line search, direct search, and
model-based solvers such as Bayesian optimization -- form the backbone of BBO,
yet often struggle in high-dimensional, noisy, or mixed-integer settings.
  Recent advances use machine learning (ML) and reinforcement learning (RL) to
enhance BBO: ML provides expressive surrogates, adaptive updates, meta-learning
portfolios, and generative models, while RL enables dynamic operator
configuration, robustness, and meta-optimization across tasks.
  This paper surveys these developments, covering representative algorithms
such as NNs with the modular model-based optimization framework (mlrMBO),
zeroth-order adaptive momentum methods (ZO-AdaMM), automated BBO (ABBO),
distributed block-wise optimization (DiBB), partition-based Bayesian
optimization (SPBOpt), the transformer-based optimizer (B2Opt),
diffusion-model-based BBO, surrogate-assisted RL for differential evolution
(Surr-RLDE), robust BBO (RBO), coordinate-ascent model-based optimization with
relative entropy (CAS-MORE), log-barrier stochastic gradient descent (LB-SGD),
policy improvement with black-box (PIBB), and offline Q-learning with Mamba
backbones (Q-Mamba).
  We also review benchmark efforts such as the NeurIPS 2020 BBO Challenge and
the MetaBox framework. Overall, we highlight how ML and RL transform classical
inexact solvers into more scalable, robust, and adaptive frameworks for
real-world optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出二进制稀疏自编码器(BAE)和二进制转码器(BTC)，通过将激活值限制为0或1来提升特征的可解释性和单义性，但会增加重构误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统稀疏自编码器(SAE)发现的许多特征只有在高激活强度下才可解释，希望通过二进制化消除连续激活变化带来的不可解释信息。

Method: 使用二进制稀疏自编码器和二进制转码器，将所有激活值约束为二进制(0或1)，消除连续激活强度的变化。

Result: 二进制化显著提高了发现特征的可解释性和单义性，但增加了重构误差和超高频不可解释特征的数量。频率调整后，连续稀疏编码器的可解释性得分略优于二进制方法。

Conclusion: 多义性可能是神经激活的固有属性，难以完全消除。二进制化虽然提升了可解释性，但也带来了新的挑战。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are used to decompose neural network activations
into sparsely activating features, but many SAE features are only interpretable
at high activation strengths. To address this issue we propose to use binary
sparse autoencoders (BAEs) and binary transcoders (BTCs), which constrain all
activations to be zero or one. We find that binarisation significantly improves
the interpretability and monosemanticity of the discovered features, while
increasing reconstruction error. By eliminating the distinction between high
and low activation strengths, we prevent uninterpretable information from being
smuggled in through the continuous variation in feature activations. However,
we also find that binarisation increases the number of uninterpretable
ultra-high frequency features, and when interpretability scores are
frequency-adjusted, the scores for continuous sparse coders are slightly better
than those of binary ones. This suggests that polysemanticity may be an
ineliminable property of neural activations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用的模型剪枝方法EMP，通过计算有效数量N_eff来确定剪枝阈值，适用于各种剪枝标准和模型架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决模型剪枝中的核心问题：应该保留多少参数？现有方法缺乏统一的剪枝标准，需要一种与上下文无关、无需参数的通用剪枝规则。

Method: 基于逆辛普森指数计算有效数量N_eff，保留得分最高的N_eff个参数，其余置零。该方法可应用于权重大小、注意力分数、KAN重要性分数等多种剪枝标准。

Result: 在MLP、CNN、Transformer/LLM和KAN等模型上的实验表明，使用EMP剪枝后的稀疏模型性能与原始密集网络相当。

Conclusion: EMP提供了一个鲁棒的剪枝阈值，默认β=1即可获得良好效果，β≠1时也可作为可选调整以满足特定稀疏性需求。

Abstract: We introduce Effective Model Pruning (EMP), a context-agnostic,
parameter-free rule addressing a fundamental question about pruning: how many
entries to keep. EMP does not prescribe how to score the parameters or prune
the models; instead, it supplies a universal adaptive threshold that can be
applied to any pruning criterion: weight magnitude, attention score, KAN
importance score, or even feature-level signals such as image pixel, and used
on structural parts or weights of the models. Given any score vector s, EMP
maps s to a built-in effective number N_eff which is inspired by the Inverse
Simpson index of contributors. Retaining the N_eff highest scoring entries and
zeroing the remainder yields sparse models with performance comparable to the
original dense networks across MLPs, CNNs, Transformers/LLMs, and KAN, in our
experiments. By leveraging the geometry of the simplex, we derive a tight lower
bound on the preserved mass s_eff (the sum of retained scores) over the
corresponding ordered probability simplex associated with the score vector s.
We further verify the effectiveness of N_eff by pruning the model with a scaled
threshold \b{eta}*N_eff across a variety of criteria and models. Experiments
suggest that the default \b{eta} = 1 yields a robust threshold for model
pruning while \b{eta} not equal to 1 still serves as an optional adjustment to
meet specific sparsity requirements.

*Zhendong Mi,Bian Sun,Grace Li Zhang,Shaoyi Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出D-Rank框架，通过层间动态秩分配优化LLM的SVD压缩，相比均匀压缩方法显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SVD压缩方法对所有层使用统一压缩率，忽略了LLM中不同层的信息密度差异，特别是中间层信息更丰富而前后层更冗余的异质性

Method: 使用有效秩作为信息密度度量，通过拉格朗日乘子优化方案动态分配秩，对注意力层进行秩重平衡，并扩展到分组查询注意力模型

Result: 在多种LLM和压缩率下，D-Rank始终优于SVD-LLM、ASVD和Basis Sharing，在LLaMA-3-8B模型上困惑度降低15%以上，在LLaMA-7B模型上零样本推理准确率提升5%

Conclusion: D-Rank通过考虑层间信息密度异质性的动态秩分配，显著提升了SVD压缩LLM的性能

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly scaled in size, bringing severe
memory and computational challenges that hinder their deployment. Singular
Value Decomposition (SVD)-based compression has emerged as an appealing
post-training compression technique for LLMs, yet most existing methods apply a
uniform compression ratio across all layers, implicitly assuming homogeneous
information included in various layers. This overlooks the substantial
intra-layer heterogeneity observed in LLMs, where middle layers tend to encode
richer information while early and late layers are more redundant. In this
work, we revisit the existing SVD-based compression method and propose D-Rank,
a framework with layer-wise balanced Dynamic Rank allocation for LLMs
compression. We first introduce effective rank as a principled metric to
measure the information density of weight matrices, and then allocate ranks via
a Lagrange multiplier-based optimization scheme to adaptively assign more
capacity to groups with higher information density under a fixed compression
ratio. Moreover, we rebalance the allocated ranks across attention layers to
account for their varying importance and extend D-Rank to latest LLMs with
grouped-query attention. Extensive experiments on various LLMs with different
scales across multiple compression ratios demonstrate that D-Rank consistently
outperforms SVD-LLM, ASVD, and Basis Sharing, achieving more than 15 lower
perplexity with LLaMA-3-8B model on C4 datasets at 20% compression ratio and up
to 5% higher zero-shot reasoning accuracy with LLaMA-7B model at 40%
compression ratio while achieving even higher throughput.

TL;DR: Swift是一个单步一致性模型，首次实现了基于连续排名概率评分(CRPS)目标的概率流模型自回归微调，消除了多模型集成或参数扰动的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型为概率天气预报提供了物理基础框架，但其典型的慢速迭代求解器在推理过程中不适用于次季节到季节(S2S)应用，这些应用需要长预报时效和领域驱动的校准。

Method: 引入Swift单步一致性模型，实现基于CRPS目标的概率流模型自回归微调，无需多模型集成或参数扰动。

Result: Swift生成的6小时预报具有技能，可保持稳定达75天，运行速度比最先进的扩散基线快39倍，预报技能与基于数值的业务IFS ENS系统相当。

Conclusion: 这标志着向从中期到季节尺度的高效可靠集合预报迈出了一步。

Abstract: Diffusion models offer a physically grounded framework for probabilistic
weather forecasting, but their typical reliance on slow, iterative solvers
during inference makes them impractical for subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S)
applications where long lead-times and domain-driven calibration are essential.
To address this, we introduce Swift, a single-step consistency model that, for
the first time, enables autoregressive finetuning of a probability flow model
with a continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) objective. This eliminates
the need for multi-model ensembling or parameter perturbations. Results show
that Swift produces skillful 6-hourly forecasts that remain stable for up to 75
days, running $39\times$ faster than state-of-the-art diffusion baselines while
achieving forecast skill competitive with the numerical-based, operational IFS
ENS. This marks a step toward efficient and reliable ensemble forecasting from
medium-range to seasonal-scales.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了预条件处理对特征学习和泛化性能的影响，发现预条件器通过Gram矩阵引入可控的谱偏置，其指数p和教师模型与输入谱的对齐是影响泛化的关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预条件处理在机器学习中广泛用于加速经验风险的收敛，但其对期望风险的影响尚未充分探索，特别是对特征学习和泛化性能的作用机制。

Method: 将预条件器实例化为输入协方差矩阵的p次幂，在单索引教师模型框架下，从三个互补视角分析：噪声鲁棒性、分布外泛化和前向知识迁移。

Result: 学习的特征表示紧密反映了预条件器引入的谱偏置，偏好被强调的组件并减少对被抑制组件的敏感性。当谱偏置与教师模型对齐时，泛化性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 预条件处理通过Gram矩阵诱导可控的谱偏置，其与教师模型谱偏置的对齐是提升泛化性能的关键，为理解预条件处理在特征学习中的作用提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Preconditioning is widely used in machine learning to accelerate convergence
on the empirical risk, yet its role on the expected risk remains underexplored.
In this work, we investigate how preconditioning affects feature learning and
generalization performance. We first show that the input information available
to the model is conveyed solely through the Gram matrix defined by the
preconditioner's metric, thereby inducing a controllable spectral bias on
feature learning. Concretely, instantiating the preconditioner as the $p$-th
power of the input covariance matrix and within a single-index teacher model,
we prove that in generalization, the exponent $p$ and the alignment between the
teacher and the input spectrum are crucial factors. We further investigate how
the interplay between these factors influences feature learning from three
complementary perspectives: (i) Robustness to noise, (ii) Out-of-distribution
generalization, and (iii) Forward knowledge transfer. Our results indicate that
the learned feature representations closely mirror the spectral bias introduced
by the preconditioner -- favoring components that are emphasized and exhibiting
reduced sensitivity to those that are suppressed. Crucially, we demonstrate
that generalization is significantly enhanced when this spectral bias is
aligned with that of the teacher.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的DeepONets需要固定传感器数量和位置，缺乏不确定性量化机制，限制了实际应用。虽然VIDON等扩展放松了传感器约束，但仍无法处理不完整测量或算子固有随机性带来的不确定性。

Method: 集成集合变换器嵌入处理稀疏和可变传感器位置，使用条件变分自编码器(cVAE)近似解算子的条件分布，通过最小化负ELBO实现原理性不确定性估计。

Result: 在确定性和随机偏微分方程（包括Navier-Stokes方程）上的数值实验证明了该框架的鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: UQ-SONet在保持预测精度的同时提供了原理性的不确定性估计，解决了算子学习中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Learning operators from data is central to scientific machine learning. While
DeepONets are widely used for their ability to handle complex domains, they
require fixed sensor numbers and locations, lack mechanisms for uncertainty
quantification (UQ), and are thus limited in practical applicability. Recent
permutationinvariant extensions, such as the Variable-Input Deep Operator
Network (VIDON), relax these sensor constraints but still rely on sufficiently
dense observations and cannot capture uncertainties arising from incomplete
measurements or from operators with inherent randomness. To address these
challenges, we propose UQ-SONet, a permutation-invariant operator learning
framework with built-in UQ. Our model integrates a set transformer embedding to
handle sparse and variable sensor locations, and employs a conditional
variational autoencoder (cVAE) to approximate the conditional distribution of
the solution operator. By minimizing the negative ELBO, UQ-SONet provides
principled uncertainty estimation while maintaining predictive accuracy.
Numerical experiments on deterministic and stochastic PDEs, including the
Navier-Stokes equation, demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the
proposed framework.

Result: 在未训练网络、MNIST和CIFAR-10模型以及VNN-COMP 2025基准测试中表现优异

Conclusion: BaB-prob方法在中等至高维输入问题上持续优于最先进方法

Abstract: Branch-and-bound with preactivation splitting has been shown highly effective
for deterministic verification of neural networks. In this paper, we extend
this framework to the probabilistic setting. We propose BaB-prob that
iteratively divides the original problem into subproblems by splitting
preactivations and leverages linear bounds computed by linear bound propagation
to bound the probability for each subproblem. We prove soundness and
completeness of BaB-prob for feedforward-ReLU neural networks. Furthermore, we
introduce the notion of uncertainty level and design two efficient strategies
for preactivation splitting, yielding BaB-prob-ordered and BaB+BaBSR-prob. We
evaluate BaB-prob on untrained networks, MNIST and CIFAR-10 models,
respectively, and VNN-COMP 2025 benchmarks. Across these settings, our approach
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in medium- to
high-dimensional input problems.

TL;DR: PWMPR是一种从稀疏到稠密的训练方法，通过路径权重乘积引导的随机增长来自动发现网络的最佳密度，避免了传统剪枝方法的高重训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法如迭代剪枝、动态稀疏训练和初始化剪枝要么需要大量重训练成本，要么需要预先确定目标密度。PWMPR旨在通过增长而非剪枝的方式，自动发现网络的最佳操作密度。

Method: 从稀疏种子开始，PWMPR使用路径核启发式分数指导添加边，通过随机化缓解瓶颈，并在逻辑拟合规则检测到精度平台期时停止增长。

Result: 在CIFAR、TinyImageNet和ImageNet上的实验表明，PWMPR能够接近IMP获得的彩票券性能（虽然密度更高），但成本显著降低（约1.5倍稠密训练vs IMP的3-4倍）。

Conclusion: 基于增长的密度发现是一个有前景的范式，与剪枝和动态稀疏方法形成互补。

Abstract: The lottery ticket hypothesis suggests that dense networks contain sparse
subnetworks that can be trained in isolation to match full-model performance.
Existing approaches-iterative pruning, dynamic sparse training, and pruning at
initialization-either incur heavy retraining costs or assume the target density
is fixed in advance. We introduce Path Weight Magnitude Product-biased Random
growth (PWMPR), a constructive sparse-to-dense training paradigm that grows
networks rather than pruning them, while automatically discovering their
operating density. Starting from a sparse seed, PWMPR adds edges guided by
path-kernel-inspired scores, mitigates bottlenecks via randomization, and stops
when a logistic-fit rule detects plateauing accuracy. Experiments on CIFAR,
TinyImageNet, and ImageNet show that PWMPR approaches the performance of
IMP-derived lottery tickets-though at higher density-at substantially lower
cost (~1.5x dense vs. 3-4x for IMP). These results establish growth-based
density discovery as a promising paradigm that complements pruning and dynamic
sparsity.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Current online reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms like GRPO share a key
limitation in LLM reasoning: they cannot learn from problems that are
"unsolvable" to the model. In other words, they can only improve performance on
problems where the model is capable of exploring the correct answer.
Consequently, the model's "upper limit" remains unchanged after RL training,
even though the likelihood of solving easier, solvable problems may increase.
These hard samples cannot contribute to training, as no rollouts yield rewards
and thus no gradients are produced. To unlock learning from these hard samples,
we propose NuRL, a "nudging" method that aims to push the upper bound of LLM
reasoning using self-generated hints, i.e., abstract cues that help reduce the
problem difficulty for the model. Given a question and its gold answer, the
model generates a CoT and then produces a hint containing the core knowledge
needed to solve the problem. During training, we generate G rollouts from the
base policy and use the pass rate to decide whether the hint should be
injected. For hard samples with a 0% pass rate, we inject the hint and
regenerate a new batch of trajectories. This yields two benefits: (1) the hint
boosts pass rates (from 0% to non-zero), thereby introducing training signals
for previously unsolvable samples, and (2) the hints are self-generated,
avoiding distributional shift and do not rely on external models. NuRL achieves
consistent improvements across 6 benchmarks and 3 models, while remaining
complementary to test-time scaling. Notably, NuRL can raise the model's upper
limit, whereas GRPO leaves pass@1024 unchanged from the base model.
Furthermore, we present a systematic study of what makes an effective hint and
when hints are most useful. Interestingly, the best hints are abstract and
high-level, and are most beneficial when applied necessarily and after GRPO has
converged.

Method: 提出多模态交互感知路由器，基于token的交互特性将其分配到专家；构建时间多模态交互动态的新公式化表示，用于指导专家路由；动态路由鼓励专家学习可泛化的交互处理技能而非任务特定特征。

Conclusion: 时间多模态交互揭示了跨应用的有意义模式，可用于改进基于MoE模型的设计和性能，提出的框架在性能和可解释性方面均有显著提升。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have become pivotal for large-scale
multimodal models. However, their routing mechanisms typically overlook the
informative, time-varying interaction dynamics between modalities. This
limitation hinders expert specialization, as the model cannot explicitly
leverage intrinsic modality relationships for effective reasoning. To address
this, we propose a novel framework that guides MoE routing using quantified
temporal interaction. A multimodal interaction-aware router learns to dispatch
tokens to experts based on the nature of their interactions. This dynamic
routing encourages experts to acquire generalizable interaction-processing
skills rather than merely learning task-specific features. Our framework builds
on a new formulation of temporal multimodal interaction dynamics, which are
used to guide expert routing. We first demonstrate that these temporal
multimodal interactions reveal meaningful patterns across applications, and
then show how they can be leveraged to improve both the design and performance
of MoE-based models. Comprehensive experiments on challenging multimodal
benchmarks validate our approach, demonstrating both enhanced performance and
improved interpretability.

Abstract: Machine learning models, by virtue of training, learn a large repertoire of
decision rules for any given input, and any one of these may suffice to justify
a prediction. However, in high-dimensional input spaces, such rules are
difficult to identify and interpret. In this paper, we introduce an
activation-matching based approach to generate minimal and faithful
explanations for the decisions of pre-trained image classifiers. We aim to
identify minimal explanations that not only preserve the model's decision but
are also concise and human-readable. To achieve this, we train a lightweight
autoencoder to produce binary masks that learns to highlight the decision-wise
critical regions of an image while discarding irrelevant background. The
training objective integrates activation alignment across multiple layers,
consistency at the output label, priors that encourage sparsity, and
compactness, along with a robustness constraint that enforces faithfulness. The
minimal explanations so generated also lead us to mechanistically interpreting
the model internals. In this regard we also introduce a circuit readout
procedure wherein using the explanation's forward pass and gradients, we
identify active channels and construct a channel-level graph, scoring
inter-layer edges by ingress weight magnitude times source activation and
feature-to-class links by classifier weight magnitude times feature activation.
Together, these contributions provide a practical bridge between minimal
input-level explanations and a mechanistic understanding of the internal
computations driving model decisions.

Abstract: Dictionary learning is traditionally formulated as an $L_1$-regularized
signal reconstruction problem. While recent developments have incorporated
discriminative, hierarchical, or generative structures, most approaches rely on
encouraging representation sparsity over individual samples that overlook how
atoms are shared across samples, resulting in redundant and sub-optimal
dictionaries. We introduce a parsimony promoting regularizer based on the
row-wise $L_\infty$ norm of the coefficient matrix. This additional penalty
encourages entire rows of the coefficient matrix to vanish, thereby reducing
the number of dictionary atoms activated across the dataset. We derive the
formulation from a probabilistic model with Beta-Bernoulli priors, which
provides a Bayesian interpretation linking the regularization parameters to
prior distributions. We further establish theoretical calculation for optimal
hyperparameter selection and connect our formulation to both Minimum
Description Length, Bayesian model selection and pathlet learning. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
substantially improved reconstruction quality (with a 20\% reduction in RMSE)
and enhanced representation sparsity, utilizing fewer than one-tenth of the
available dictionary atoms, while empirically validating our theoretical
analysis.

*Tingyu Shi,Fan Lyu,Shaoliang Peng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CPATTA是一种基于保形预测的主动测试时适应方法，通过引入有理论保证的不确定性度量和在线权重更新算法，显著提高了数据选择效率，在准确率上比现有ATTA方法提升约5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的主动测试时适应方法使用启发式不确定性度量，数据选择效率低，浪费人工标注预算。需要引入有理论保证的不确定性度量来提高效率。

Method: 使用平滑保形分数和top-K确定性度量，基于伪覆盖率的在线权重更新算法，域偏移检测器自适应人类监督，以及平衡人工标注和模型标注数据的分阶段更新方案。

Result: 大量实验表明，CPATTA在准确率上持续优于最先进的ATTA方法约5%。

Conclusion: CPATTA成功将保形预测引入主动测试时适应，提供了有覆盖保证的不确定性度量，显著提高了数据选择效率和模型性能。

Abstract: Active Test-Time Adaptation (ATTA) improves model robustness under domain
shift by selectively querying human annotations at deployment, but existing
methods use heuristic uncertainty measures and suffer from low data selection
efficiency, wasting human annotation budget. We propose Conformal Prediction
Active TTA (CPATTA), which first brings principled, coverage-guaranteed
uncertainty into ATTA. CPATTA employs smoothed conformal scores with a top-K
certainty measure, an online weight-update algorithm driven by pseudo coverage,
a domain-shift detector that adapts human supervision, and a staged update
scheme balances human-labeled and model-labeled data. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CPATTA consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art ATTA
methods by around 5% in accuracy. Our code and datasets are available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用视觉语言模型生成伪标签来训练时间序列问答模型的方法，利用深度神经网络对噪声标签的鲁棒性，在缺乏标注数据的情况下有效训练TSQA模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列问答任务面临标注数据不足的挑战，而视觉语言模型具有零样本分析时间序列信号的潜力，但可能产生错误标签。

Method: 使用视觉语言模型生成伪标签，然后基于深度神经网络对噪声标签的鲁棒性来训练时间序列问答模型。

Result: 实验结果表明，TSQA模型不仅能够成功使用伪标签进行训练，而且通过利用大量未标注数据，其性能超过了视觉语言模型本身。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了使用伪标签训练TSQA模型的有效性，能够克服标注数据不足的问题，并实现超越原始视觉语言模型的性能。

Abstract: Time-series question answering (TSQA) tasks face significant challenges due
to the lack of labeled data. Alternatively, with recent advancements in
large-scale models, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated the
potential to analyze time-series signals in a zero-shot manner. In this paper,
we propose a training approach that uses pseudo labels generated by a VLM.
Although VLMs can produce incorrect labels, TSQA models can still be
effectively trained based on the property that deep neural networks are
inherently robust to such noisy labels. Our experimental results demonstrate
that TSQA models are not only successfully trained with pseudo labels, but also
surpass the performance of the VLM itself by leveraging a large amount of
unlabeled data.

Abstract: Accurate and physically feasible human motion prediction is crucial for safe
and seamless human-robot collaboration. While recent advancements in human
motion capture enable real-time pose estimation, the practical value of many
existing approaches is limited by the lack of future predictions and
consideration of physical constraints. Conventional motion prediction schemes
rely heavily on past poses, which are not always available in real-world
scenarios. To address these limitations, we present a physics-informed learning
framework that integrates domain knowledge into both training and inference to
predict human motion using inertial measurements from only 5 IMUs. We propose a
network that accounts for the spatial characteristics of human movements.
During training, we incorporate forward and differential kinematics functions
as additional loss components to regularize the learned joint predictions. At
the inference stage, we refine the prediction from the previous iteration to
update a joint state buffer, which is used as extra inputs to the network.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves high accuracy,
smooth transitions between motions, and generalizes well to unseen subjects

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应图粗化方法，在训练过程中联合学习图神经网络参数并通过K-means聚类合并节点，以处理大规模图数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着现实世界图的规模不断扩大，直接处理变得越来越困难。针对大规模数据定制算法可能会牺牲性能，因此考虑通过图缩减来减少训练期间使用的数据量。

Method: 同时训练图神经网络并通过基于节点嵌入的K-means聚类对图进行粗化，在训练过程中合并节点，使节点聚类能够适应学习任务。

Result: 在同性恋和异质性节点分类数据集上验证了该方法，并可视化节点嵌入与其对应聚类之间的关系，证明粗化图在训练过程中能够适应学习任务。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理大规模图数据，特别适用于其他方法难以处理的场景，如异质性数据，且节点聚类能够动态适应学习任务。

Abstract: We propose an adaptive graph coarsening method to jointly learn graph neural
network (GNN) parameters and merge nodes via K-means clustering during
training. As real-world graphs grow larger, processing them directly becomes
increasingly challenging and sometimes infeasible. Tailoring algorithms to
large-scale data may sacrifice performance, so we instead consider graph
reduction to decrease the amount of data used during training. In particular,
we propose a method to simultaneously train a GNN and coarsen its graph by
partitioning nodes via K-means clustering based on their embeddings. Unlike
past graph coarsening works, our approach allows us to merge nodes during
training. Not only does this preclude coarsening as a preprocessing step, but
our node clusters can adapt to the learning task instead of relying solely on
graph connectivity and features. Thus, our method is amenable to scenarios that
are challenging for other methods, such as heterophilic data. We validate our
approach on both homophilic and heterophilic node classification datasets. We
further visualize relationships between node embeddings and their corresponding
clusters to illustrate that our coarsened graph adapts to the learning task
during training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Expert Merging和Expert Merging++方法，通过层间系数学习和重要性引导分块，实现无需标签、参数高效的多专家模型融合，在LLM和MLLM上超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型融合方法存在局限：无训练方法依赖手动调参，训练方法主要对齐参数而非下游任务表现，且通常忽略层间异质性。

Method: Expert Merging使用未标注校准数据学习层间系数，通过隐藏状态和对数对齐优化；Expert Merging++引入重要性引导分块，根据重要性指标为不同层分配不同数量的分块系数。

Result: 在InternVL、Qwen2-VL和Mistral等骨干网络上，该方法超越了强基线，Expert Merging++在某些情况下甚至超过监督混合训练。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种无需标签、参数高效且可扩展的多专家模型融合方案，在LLM和MLLM上表现优异。

Abstract: Model merging, which combines multiple domain-specialized experts into a
single model, offers a practical path to endow Large Language Models (LLMs) and
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with broad capabilities without the
cost of joint training or serving many models. However, training-free methods
rely on hand-tuned coefficients, whereas training-based methods primarily align
parameters rather than downstream task behavior and typically treat all layers
uniformly, ignoring inter-layer heterogeneity. We introduce Expert Merging, a
training-light method that learns a small set of layer-wise coefficients using
only unlabeled calibration data. The coefficients are optimized to explicitly
align the merged model's hidden states and logits with those of the
corresponding experts, with a coefficient regularizer for stability and
task-weighted losses for controllable trade-offs. To capture inter-layer
variation, Expert Merging++ augments this design with importance-guided
chunking: a normalized layer-importance metric, derived from learned
coefficients, task-vector magnitudes, and parameter counts, allocates more
chunk-wise coefficients to high-importance layers while keeping low-importance
layers lightweight. The result is a label-free, parameter-efficient, and
scalable approach to multi-expert model merging across LLMs and MLLMs. Across
MLLM backbones (InternVL and Qwen2-VL) and the LLM backbone (Mistral), our
method surpasses strong training-free and training-based merging baselines,
with Expert Merging++ delivering further gains and, in some cases, even
exceeding supervised Mixture Training. The source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准流匹配在长尾分布中存在多数类偏差，无法准确生成少数类模式且不能匹配真实类别比例。

Method: 使用小批量不平衡最优输运构建条件向量场，通过基于目标分布与UOT边缘密度比的标签无关多数分数进行逆重加权。

Result: 在长尾基准测试中优于现有流匹配基线，在平衡数据集上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: UOT-RFM能够有效缓解多数类偏差，无需类别标签即可改善尾部类别生成质量。

Abstract: Flow matching has recently emerged as a powerful framework for
continuous-time generative modeling. However, when applied to long-tailed
distributions, standard flow matching suffers from majority bias, producing
minority modes with low fidelity and failing to match the true class
proportions. In this work, we propose Unbalanced Optimal Transport Reweighted
Flow Matching (UOT-RFM), a novel framework for generative modeling under
class-imbalanced (long-tailed) distributions that operates without any class
label information. Our method constructs the conditional vector field using
mini-batch Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) and mitigates majority bias
through a principled inverse reweighting strategy. The reweighting relies on a
label-free majority score, defined as the density ratio between the target
distribution and the UOT marginal. This score quantifies the degree of majority
based on the geometric structure of the data, without requiring class labels.
By incorporating this score into the training objective, UOT-RFM theoretically
recovers the target distribution with first-order correction ($k=1$) and
empirically improves tail-class generation through higher-order corrections ($k
> 1$). Our model outperforms existing flow matching baselines on long-tailed
benchmarks, while maintaining competitive performance on balanced datasets.

Motivation: 传统声明验证方法忽视证据间的复杂交互，导致不可靠结果。完全连接图方法面临数据噪声和数据偏差两大挑战。

Method: MuPlon框架集成后门路径和前门路径的双因果干预策略：后门路径通过优化节点概率权重稀释噪声干扰并增强相关证据连接；前门路径提取高相关子图构建推理路径，应用反事实推理消除数据偏差。

Result: 实验结果表明MuPlon优于现有方法，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: MuPlon通过双因果干预策略有效解决了声明验证中的数据噪声和偏差问题，提升了验证可靠性。

Abstract: As a critical task in data quality control, claim verification aims to curb
the spread of misinformation by assessing the truthfulness of claims based on a
wide range of evidence. However, traditional methods often overlook the complex
interactions between evidence, leading to unreliable verification results. A
straightforward solution represents the claim and evidence as a fully connected
graph, which we define as the Claim-Evidence Graph (C-E Graph). Nevertheless,
claim verification methods based on fully connected graphs face two primary
confounding challenges, Data Noise and Data Biases. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel framework, Multi-Path Causal Optimization
(MuPlon). MuPlon integrates a dual causal intervention strategy, consisting of
the back-door path and front-door path. In the back-door path, MuPlon dilutes
noisy node interference by optimizing node probability weights, while
simultaneously strengthening the connections between relevant evidence nodes.
In the front-door path, MuPlon extracts highly relevant subgraphs and
constructs reasoning paths, further applying counterfactual reasoning to
eliminate data biases within these paths. The experimental results demonstrate
that MuPlon outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

Abstract: Ship traffic is an increasing source of underwater radiated noise in coastal
waters, motivating real-time digital twins of ocean acoustics for operational
noise mitigation. We present a physics-guided probabilistic framework to
predict three-dimensional transmission loss in realistic ocean environments. As
a case study, we consider the Salish Sea along shipping routes from the Pacific
Ocean to the Port of Vancouver. A dataset of over 30 million source-receiver
pairs was generated with a Gaussian beam solver across seasonal sound speed
profiles and one-third-octave frequency bands spanning 12.5 Hz to 8 kHz. We
first assess sparse variational Gaussian processes (SVGP) and then incorporate
physics-based mean functions combining spherical spreading with
frequency-dependent absorption. To capture nonlinear effects, we examine deep
sigma-point processes and stochastic variational deep kernel learning. The
final framework integrates four components: (i) a learnable physics-informed
mean that represents dominant propagation trends, (ii) a convolutional encoder
for bathymetry along the source-receiver track, (iii) a neural encoder for
source, receiver, and frequency coordinates, and (iv) a residual SVGP layer
that provides calibrated predictive uncertainty. This probabilistic digital
twin facilitates the construction of sound-exposure bounds and worst-case
scenarios for received levels. We further demonstrate the application of the
framework to ship speed optimization, where predicted transmission loss
combined with near-field source models provides sound exposure level estimates
for minimizing acoustic impacts on marine mammals. The proposed framework
advances uncertainty-aware digital twins for ocean acoustics and illustrates
how physics-guided machine learning can support sustainable maritime
operations.

Conclusion: 证明了简单原则的有效性：通过聚合节点特征噪声与结构特征来提升图对比学习性能，为异质图表示学习提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has shown strong promise for unsupervised
graph representation learning, yet its effectiveness on heterophilic graphs,
where connected nodes often belong to different classes, remains limited. Most
existing methods rely on complex augmentation schemes, intricate encoders, or
negative sampling, which raises the question of whether such complexity is
truly necessary in this challenging setting. In this work, we revisit the
foundations of supervised and unsupervised learning on graphs and uncover a
simple yet effective principle for GCL: mitigating node feature noise by
aggregating it with structural features derived from the graph topology. This
observation suggests that the original node features and the graph structure
naturally provide two complementary views for contrastive learning. Building on
this insight, we propose an embarrassingly simple GCL model that uses a GCN
encoder to capture structural features and an MLP encoder to isolate node
feature noise. Our design requires neither data augmentation nor negative
sampling, yet achieves state-of-the-art results on heterophilic benchmarks with
minimal computational and memory overhead, while also offering advantages in
homophilic graphs in terms of complexity, scalability, and robustness. We
provide theoretical justification for our approach and validate its
effectiveness through extensive experiments, including robustness evaluations
against both black-box and white-box adversarial attacks.

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法无需保留数据集即可达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: RCU方法有效解决了连续机器遗忘中的累积灾难性效用损失问题，为LLM安全提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent, their security
vulnerabilities have already drawn attention. Machine unlearning is introduced
to seek to mitigate these risks by removing the influence of undesirable data.
However, existing methods not only rely on the retained dataset to preserve
model utility, but also suffer from cumulative catastrophic utility loss under
continuous unlearning requests. To solve this dilemma, we propose a novel
method, called Rotation Control Unlearning (RCU), which leverages the
rotational salience weight of RCU to quantify and control the unlearning degree
in the continuous unlearning process. The skew symmetric loss is designed to
construct the existence of the cognitive rotation space, where the changes of
rotational angle can simulate the continuous unlearning process. Furthermore,
we design an orthogonal rotation axes regularization to enforce mutually
perpendicular rotation directions for continuous unlearning requests,
effectively minimizing interference and addressing cumulative catastrophic
utility loss. Experiments on multiple datasets confirm that our method without
retained dataset achieves SOTA performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OPPO是一个新颖的轻量级PPO-based RLHF框架，通过重叠流水线执行提高训练效率，加速训练1.8-2.8倍，提升GPU利用率1.4-2.1倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的PPO-based RLHF训练存在效率低下的问题，主要由于顺序多模型依赖和长尾响应长度导致阶段完成延迟。

Method: 提出两种新技术：1）步骤内重叠，将上游模型输出流式分块，使下游模型可以提前预填充；2）步骤间重叠，自适应地过度提交少量提示并将长生成推迟到未来步骤。

Result: OPPO加速PPO-based RLHF训练1.8-2.8倍，提升GPU利用率1.4-2.1倍，且不影响训练收敛。

Conclusion: OPPO是一个模型无关的轻量级框架，只需少量代码修改即可集成到现有PPO实现中，显著提高训练效率。

Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF) is a widely adopted paradigm for aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences. However, its training pipeline suffers from
substantial inefficiencies due to sequential multi-model dependencies (e.g.,
reward model depends on actor outputs) and long-tail response lengths, where a
few long responses straggle the stage completion. We present OPPO, a novel,
lightweight, and model-agnostic PPO-based RLHF framework that improves training
efficiency by overlapping pipeline execution. OPPO introduces two novel
techniques: (1) Intra-step overlap, which streams upstream model outputs (e.g.,
actor model) in right-sized chunks, enabling the downstream model (e.g.,
reward) to begin prefill while the upstream continues decoding; and (2)
Inter-step overlap, which adaptively overcommits a few prompts and defers long
generations to future steps, mitigating tail latency without discarding partial
work. OPPO integrates easily with existing PPO implementations with a few lines
of code change. Extensive evaluations show that OPPO accelerates PPO-based RLHF
training by $1.8 \times-2.8 \times$ and improves GPU utilization by $1.4
\times-2.1 \times$ without compromising training convergence.

TL;DR: 提出了一个自主感知聚类框架，通过强化学习结合确定性退火来学习并考虑实体局部自主性对聚类结果的影响，无需预先知道自主性形式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类方法假设实体是被动的，但现实中实体具有局部自主性，会以特征表示无法完全捕捉的方式覆盖预设关联，这会显著改变聚类结果。

Method: 将强化学习与确定性退火过程集成，在退火早期促进探索，后期转向利用。还提出了自适应距离估计网络(ADEN)，这是一个基于transformer的注意力模型，学习实体与聚类代表之间的依赖关系。

Result: 即使没有显式的自主性模型，该框架也能获得接近真实情况的解（差距约3-4%），而忽略自主性会导致更大的差距（约35-40%）。

Conclusion: 自主感知聚类框架能够有效捕捉数据动态，显著提升聚类性能，特别是在实体具有局部自主性的场景下。

Abstract: Clustering arises in a wide range of problem formulations, yet most existing
approaches assume that the entities under clustering are passive and strictly
conform to their assigned groups. In reality, entities often exhibit local
autonomy, overriding prescribed associations in ways not fully captured by
feature representations. Such autonomy can substantially reshape clustering
outcomes -- altering cluster compositions, geometry, and cardinality -- with
significant downstream effects on inference and decision-making. We introduce
autonomy-aware clustering, a reinforcement (RL) learning framework that learns
and accounts for the influence of local autonomy without requiring prior
knowledge of its form. Our approach integrates RL with a deterministic
annealing (DA) procedure, where, to determine underlying clusters, DA naturally
promotes exploration in early stages of annealing and transitions to
exploitation later. We also show that the annealing procedure exhibits phase
transitions that enable design of efficient annealing schedules. To further
enhance adaptability, we propose the Adaptive Distance Estimation Network
(ADEN), a transformer-based attention model that learns dependencies between
entities and cluster representatives within the RL loop, accommodates
variable-sized inputs and outputs, and enables knowledge transfer across
diverse problem instances. Empirical results show that our framework closely
aligns with underlying data dynamics: even without explicit autonomy models, it
achieves solutions close to the ground truth (gap ~3-4%), whereas ignoring
autonomy leads to substantially larger gaps (~35-40%). The code and data are
publicly available at https://github.com/salar96/AutonomyAwareClustering.

Conclusion: 双重乐观算法有效解决了在线学习中动态生成动作的决策问题，在理论和实证上都表现出色，为扩展动作空间的在线学习提供了首个次线性遗憾保证。

Abstract: With advances in generative AI, decision-making agents can now dynamically
create new actions during online learning, but action generation typically
incurs costs that must be balanced against potential benefits. We study an
online learning problem where an agent can generate new actions at any time
step by paying a one-time cost, with these actions becoming permanently
available for future use. The challenge lies in learning the optimal sequence
of two-fold decisions: which action to take and when to generate new ones,
further complicated by the triangular tradeoffs among exploitation, exploration
and $\textit{creation}$. To solve this problem, we propose a doubly-optimistic
algorithm that employs Lower Confidence Bounds (LCB) for action selection and
Upper Confidence Bounds (UCB) for action generation. Empirical evaluation on
healthcare question-answering datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves
favorable generation-quality tradeoffs compared to baseline strategies. From
theoretical perspectives, we prove that our algorithm achieves the optimal
regret of $O(T^{\frac{d}{d+2}}d^{\frac{d}{d+2}} + d\sqrt{T\log T})$, providing
the first sublinear regret bound for online learning with expanding action
spaces.

Abstract: Bridging information geometry with machine learning, this paper presents a
method for constructing neural networks intrinsically on statistical manifolds.
We demonstrate this approach by formulating a neural network architecture
directly on the lognormal statistical manifold. The construction is driven by
the Hamiltonian system that is equivalent to the gradient flow on this
manifold. First, we define the network's input values using the coordinate
system of this Hamiltonian dynamics, naturally embedded in the Poincare disk.
The core of our contribution lies in the derivation of the network's components
from geometric principles: the rotation component of the synaptic weight matrix
is determined by the Lie group action of SU(1,1) on the disk, while the
activation function emerges from the symplectic structure of the system. We
subsequently obtain the complete weight matrix, including its translation
vector, and the resulting output values. This work shows that the lognormal
manifold can be seamlessly viewed as a neural manifold, with its geometric
properties dictating a unique and interpretable neural network structure. The
proposed method offers a new paradigm for building learning systems grounded in
the differential geometry of their underlying parameter spaces.

Abstract: Industrial design evaluation often relies on high-fidelity simulations of
governing partial differential equations (PDEs). While accurate, these
simulations are computationally expensive, making dense exploration of design
spaces impractical. Operator learning has emerged as a promising approach to
accelerate PDE solution prediction; however, its effectiveness is often limited
by the scarcity of labeled physics-based data. At the same time, large numbers
of geometry-only candidate designs are readily available but remain largely
untapped. We propose a two-stage framework to better exploit this abundant,
physics-agnostic resource and improve supervised operator learning under
limited labeled data. In Stage 1, we pretrain an autoencoder on a geometry
reconstruction task to learn an expressive latent representation without PDE
labels. In Stage 2, the neural operator is trained in a standard supervised
manner to predict PDE solutions, using the pretrained latent embeddings as
inputs instead of raw point clouds. Transformer-based architectures are adopted
for both the autoencoder and the neural operator to handle point cloud data and
integrate both stages seamlessly. Across four PDE datasets and three
state-of-the-art transformer-based neural operators, our approach consistently
improves prediction accuracy compared to models trained directly on raw point
cloud inputs. These results demonstrate that representations from
physics-agnostic pretraining provide a powerful foundation for data-efficient
operator learning.

Conclusion: 提出的方法成功解决了干预后选择偏差对因果发现的挑战，超越了传统的等价类方法，能够识别真实的因果结构。

Abstract: Interventional causal discovery seeks to identify causal relations by
leveraging distributional changes introduced by interventions, even in the
presence of latent confounders. Beyond the spurious dependencies induced by
latent confounders, we highlight a common yet often overlooked challenge in the
problem due to post-treatment selection, in which samples are selectively
included in datasets after interventions. This fundamental challenge widely
exists in biological studies; for example, in gene expression analysis, both
observational and interventional samples are retained only if they meet quality
control criteria (e.g., highly active cells). Neglecting post-treatment
selection may introduce spurious dependencies and distributional changes under
interventions, which can mimic causal responses, thereby distorting causal
discovery results and challenging existing causal formulations. To address
this, we introduce a novel causal formulation that explicitly models
post-treatment selection and reveals how its differential reactions to
interventions can distinguish causal relations from selection patterns,
allowing us to go beyond traditional equivalence classes toward the underlying
true causal structure. We then characterize its Markov properties and propose a
Fine-grained Interventional equivalence class, named FI-Markov equivalence,
represented by a new graphical diagram, F-PAG. Finally, we develop a provably
sound and complete algorithm, F-FCI, to identify causal relations, latent
confounders, and post-treatment selection up to $\mathcal{FI}$-Markov
equivalence, using both observational and interventional data. Experimental
results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method
recovers causal relations despite the presence of both selection and latent
confounders.

Explainable AI. The proposed system integrates ensemble learning techniques,
i.e., an optimized Random Forest known as CardioForest, and models like XGBoost

available MIMIC-IV dataset. The testing was carried out with the assistance of
accuracy, balanced accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC-AUC, and error
rate (RMSE, MAE) measures. In addition, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
was used to ascertain model explainability and clinical relevance. The
CardioForest model performed best on all metrics, achieving a test accuracy of
94.95%, a balanced accuracy of 88.31%, and high precision and recall metrics.
SHAP analysis confirmed the model's ability to rank the most relevant ECG
features, such as QRS duration, in accordance with clinical intuitions, thereby
fostering trust and usability in clinical practice. The findings recognize
CardioForest as an extremely dependable and interpretable WCT detection model.
Being able to offer accurate predictions and transparency through

TL;DR: AR3PO是一种采样高效的RLVR算法，通过自适应rollout和响应重用技术解决GRPO中的优势消失问题，在多个基准测试中优于GRPO，与DAPO性能相当但显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GRPO算法中当组内所有响应获得相同奖励时出现的优势消失问题，提高强化学习验证奖励(RLVR)范式的训练效率和性能。

Method: 提出AR3PO算法，包含两个关键技术：自适应rollout（动态分配更多响应给困难提示，节省简单提示的计算）和响应重用（利用先前生成的正確响应提供有用训练信号）。

Result: 在7B和8B模型上，AR3PO持续优于GRPO，与DAPO相当或更好，将rollout成本降低高达4.2倍；在32B模型上，AR3PO在相似训练步数下达到与DAPO相当的性能，同时保持显著更低的rollout成本。

Conclusion: AR3PO通过自适应采样和响应重用有效解决了RLVR训练中的优势消失问题，在保持高性能的同时大幅降低了计算成本，为大规模语言模型的后训练提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive reasoning performance,
with reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) emerging as a
standard paradigm for post-training. A representative algorithm, group relative
policy optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024), computes advantages by
normalizing outcome rewards within response groups, but suffers from a
vanishing advantage issue when all responses in a group receive identical
rewards. To address this issue, we propose Adaptive Rollout and Response Reuse
Policy Optimization (AR3PO), a sampling efficient RLVR algorithm that
introduces two novel techniques: adaptive rollout, which dynamically allocates
more responses to difficult prompts while saving computation on easier ones,
and response reuse, which leverages previously generated correct responses to
provide useful training signals. We compare AR3PO with strong RLVR baselines on
multiple representative benchmarks using two different families of base models.
Across the 7B and 8B models, AR3PO consistently outperforms GRPO and matches or
surpasses DAPO (Yu et al., 2025), reducing rollout cost by up to 4.2x. On the
larger 32B model, AR3PO achieves comparable performance to DAPO at similar
training steps while maintaining substantially lower rollout cost.

Motivation: 大语言模型在强化学习中表现优秀，但要充分发挥潜力需要中期训练阶段来识别有用的紧凑动作集，并实现快速在线选择。

Method: 提出了Reasoning as Action Abstractions (RA3)算法，通过推导序列变分下界，使用强化学习迭代发现时间一致的潜在结构，然后在引导数据上进行微调。

Result: 在代码生成任务上，RA3在HumanEval和MBPP上的平均性能分别比基础模型和下一个token预测基线提高了8和4个百分点，在RLVR中实现了更快的收敛和更高的渐近性能。

Conclusion: 中期训练在决策空间紧凑且有效视野较短时最为有效，强调在动作抽象空间而非原始动作空间中进行操作的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models excel with reinforcement learning (RL), but fully
unlocking this potential requires a mid-training stage. An effective
mid-training phase should identify a compact set of useful actions and enable
fast selection among them through online RL. We formalize this intuition by
presenting the first theoretical result on how mid-training shapes
post-training: it characterizes an action subspace that minimizes both the
value approximation error from pruning and the RL error during subsequent
planning. Our analysis reveals two key determinants of mid-training
effectiveness: pruning efficiency, which shapes the prior of the initial RL
policy, and its impact on RL convergence, which governs the extent to which
that policy can be improved via online interactions. These results suggest that
mid-training is most effective when the decision space is compact and the
effective horizon is short, highlighting the importance of operating in the
space of action abstractions rather than primitive actions. Building on these
insights, we propose Reasoning as Action Abstractions (RA3), a scalable
mid-training algorithm. Specifically, we derive a sequential variational lower
bound and optimize it by iteratively discovering temporally-consistent latent
structures via RL, followed by fine-tuning on the bootstrapped data.
Experiments on code generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach. Across multiple base models, RA3 improves the average performance on
HumanEval and MBPP by 8 and 4 points over the base model and the next-token
prediction baseline. Furthermore, RA3 achieves faster convergence and higher
asymptotic performance in RLVR on HumanEval+, MBPP+, LiveCodeBench, and
Codeforces.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于完全异步去中心化多玩家多臂老虎机的新算法，通过自适应切换探索和利用阶段来解决玩家碰撞和动态玩家数量检测的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界系统通常是去中心化和异步的，玩家可以随时加入或离开，且没有全局时钟，这带来了玩家间难以协调避免碰撞和动态玩家数量检测的挑战。

Method: 玩家自适应地在探索和利用之间切换：探索阶段均匀拉动臂以减少碰撞概率；利用阶段以较小概率继续拉动其他玩家正在利用的臂，以检测玩家离开情况。

Result: 算法实现了$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T \log T} + {\log T}/{\Delta^2})$的遗憾界，其中$\Delta$是任意两个臂之间期望奖励的最小差距。

Conclusion: 这是首个在异步去中心化环境中的高效MP-MAB算法，实验验证了其有效性和鲁棒性，适用于现实场景。

Abstract: In recent years, multi-player multi-armed bandits (MP-MAB) have been
extensively studied due to their wide applications in cognitive radio networks
and Internet of Things systems. While most existing research on MP-MAB focuses
on synchronized settings, real-world systems are often decentralized and
asynchronous, where players may enter or leave the system at arbitrary times,
and do not have a global clock. This decentralized asynchronous setting
introduces two major challenges. First, without a global time, players cannot
implicitly coordinate their actions through time, making it difficult to avoid
collisions. Second, it is important to detect how many players are in the
system, but doing so may cost a lot. In this paper, we address the challenges
posed by such a fully asynchronous setting in a decentralized environment. We
develop a novel algorithm in which players adaptively change between
exploration and exploitation. During exploration, players uniformly pull their
arms, reducing the probability of collisions and effectively mitigating the
first challenge. Meanwhile, players continue pulling arms currently exploited
by others with a small probability, enabling them to detect when a player has
left, thereby addressing the second challenge. We prove that our algorithm
achieves a regret of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T \log T} + {\log T}/{\Delta^2})$,
where $\Delta$ is the minimum expected reward gap between any two arms. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first efficient MP-MAB algorithm in the
asynchronous and decentralized environment. Extensive experiments further
validate the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithm, demonstrating its
applicability to real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: Kairos通过自适应处理机制有效解决了时间序列信息密度异质性问题，为时间序列基础模型提供了更灵活的建模框架。

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
time series analysis, driven by large-scale pretraining on diverse data
corpora. However, time series inherently exhibit heterogeneous information
density over time, influenced by system states and signal complexity,
presenting significant modeling challenges especially in a zero-shot scenario.
Current TSFMs rely on non-adaptive processing pipelines that fail to capture
this dynamic nature. For example, common tokenization strategies such as
fixed-size patching enforce rigid observational granularity, limiting their
ability to adapt to varying information densities. Similarly, conventional
positional encodings impose a uniform temporal scale, making it difficult to
model diverse periodicities and trends across series. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Kairos, a flexible TSFM framework that integrates a
dynamic patching tokenizer and an instance-adaptive positional embedding.
Kairos adaptively selects tokenization granularity and tailors positional
encodings to the unique characteristics of each time series instance. Trained
on a large-scale Predictability-Stratified Time Series (PreSTS) corpus
comprising over 300 billion time points and adopting a multi-patch prediction
strategy in the inference stage, Kairos achieves superior performance with much
fewer parameters on two common zero-shot benchmarks, GIFT-Eval and the
Time-Series-Library benchmark, consistently outperforming established methods
across diverse tasks. The project page is at

Motivation: 多模态模型往往过度依赖主导模态，无法达到最佳性能。现有方法主要关注修改训练目标或优化过程，而数据中心的解决方案尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出MIDAS方法：1) 生成语义不一致的跨模态错位样本；2) 使用单模态置信度进行标注；3) 引入弱模态加权机制，动态增加最不自信模态的损失权重；4) 提出难样本加权机制，优先处理语义模糊的错位样本。

Result: 在多个多模态分类基准测试上的实验表明，MIDAS在解决模态不平衡问题上显著优于相关基线方法。

Conclusion: MIDAS通过数据增强和动态加权机制有效解决了多模态模型中的模态不平衡问题，提高了模型性能。

Abstract: Multimodal models often over-rely on dominant modalities, failing to achieve
optimal performance. While prior work focuses on modifying training objectives
or optimization procedures, data-centric solutions remain underexplored. We
propose MIDAS, a novel data augmentation strategy that generates misaligned
samples with semantically inconsistent cross-modal information, labeled using
unimodal confidence scores to compel learning from contradictory signals.
However, this confidence-based labeling can still favor the more confident
modality. To address this within our misaligned samples, we introduce
weak-modality weighting, which dynamically increases the loss weight of the
least confident modality, thereby helping the model fully utilize weaker
modality. Furthermore, when misaligned features exhibit greater similarity to
the aligned features, these misaligned samples pose a greater challenge,
thereby enabling the model to better distinguish between classes. To leverage
this, we propose hard-sample weighting, which prioritizes such semantically
ambiguous misaligned samples. Experiments on multiple multimodal classification
benchmarks demonstrate that MIDAS significantly outperforms related baselines
in addressing modality imbalance.

Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏方法存在两个主要问题：使用softmax匹配概率会模糊有价值的logit信息，而直接logit蒸馏(DLD)未能考虑logit平移不变性，限制了解决方案空间。

Method: 提出Concrete Score Distillation (CSD)，一种离散分数匹配目标，解决了自回归LLM中离散分数匹配的训练不稳定性和二次复杂度问题，并在框架内提供了模式寻求和模式覆盖的实例。

Result: 在GPT-2-1.5B、OpenLLaMA-7B和GEMMA-7B-IT上的实验表明，CSD始终优于最近的知识蒸馏目标，实现了有利的保真度-多样性权衡，并与在线策略技术结合产生互补增益。

Conclusion: CSD展示了其在LLM蒸馏中的可扩展性和有效性，为高效推理提供了更好的知识蒸馏方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver remarkable performance but are costly to
deploy, motivating knowledge distillation (KD) for efficient inference.
Existing KD objectives typically match student and teacher probabilities via
softmax, which blurs valuable logit information. While direct logit
distillation (DLD) mitigates softmax smoothing, it fails to account for logit
shift invariance, thereby restricting the solution space. We propose Concrete
Score Distillation (CSD), a discrete score-matching objective that overcomes
both softmax-induced smoothing and restrictions on the optimal solution set. We
resolve the training instability and quadratic complexity of discrete
score-matching in autoregressive LLMs, and the resulting CSD objective aligns
relative logit differences across all vocabulary pairs between student and
teacher with flexible weighting. We provide both mode-seeking and mode-covering
instances within our framework and evaluate CSD on task-agnostic
instruction-following and task-specific distillation using GPT-2-1.5B,
OpenLLaMA-7B, and GEMMA-7B-IT. Experiments show that CSD consistently surpasses
recent KD objectives, achieves favorable fidelity-diversity trade-offs, and
yields complementary gains when combined with on-policy techniques,
demonstrating its scalability and effectiveness for LLM distillation.

Result: 在10个真实数据集上的实验表明，S^2FS在分类准确率和聚类性能上持续优于8种最先进的特征选择算法，特征可视化进一步证实了所选特征的可解释性。

Conclusion: S^2FS通过整合空间方向信息提供更全面的类别结构表征，在模糊决策系统中实现了更好的特征选择效果，提升了预测性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Feature selection is crucial for fuzzy decision systems (FDSs), as it
identifies informative features and eliminates rule redundancy, thereby
enhancing predictive performance and interpretability. Most existing methods
either fail to directly align evaluation criteria with learning performance or
rely solely on non-directional Euclidean distances to capture relationships
among decision classes, which limits their ability to clarify decision
boundaries. However, the spatial distribution of instances has a potential
impact on the clarity of such boundaries. Motivated by this, we propose
Spatially-aware Separability-driven Feature Selection (S$^2$FS), a novel
framework for FDSs guided by a spatially-aware separability criterion. This
criterion jointly considers within-class compactness and between-class
separation by integrating scalar-distances with spatial directional
information, providing a more comprehensive characterization of class
structures. S$^2$FS employs a forward greedy strategy to iteratively select the
most discriminative features. Extensive experiments on ten real-world datasets
demonstrate that S$^2$FS consistently outperforms eight state-of-the-art
feature selection algorithms in both classification accuracy and clustering
performance, while feature visualizations further confirm the interpretability
of the selected features.

Conclusion: 自适应预算分配方法能有效解决梯度消失问题，显著提升LLM自改进的训练效率和最终性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can self-improve through reinforcement learning,
where they generate trajectories to explore and discover better solutions.
However, this exploration process is computationally expensive, often forcing
current methods to assign limited exploration budgets to each task. This
uniform allocation creates problematic edge cases: easy tasks consistently
succeed while difficult tasks consistently fail, both producing zero gradients
during training updates for the widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO). We address this problem from the lens of exploration budget allocation.
Viewing each task's exploration as an "item" with a distinct "value" and
"cost", we establish a connection to the classical knapsack problem. This
formulation allows us to derive an optimal assignment rule that adaptively
distributes resources based on the model's current learning status. When
applied to GRPO, our method increases the effective ratio of non-zero policy
gradients by 20-40% during training. Acting as a computational "free lunch",
our approach could reallocate exploration budgets from tasks where learning is
saturated to those where it is most impactful. This enables significantly
larger budgets (e.g., 93 rollouts) for especially challenging problems, which
would be computationally prohibitive under a uniform allocation. These
improvements translate to meaningful gains on mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, with average improvements of 2-4 points and peak gains of 9 points
on specific tasks. Notably, achieving comparable performance with traditional
homogeneous allocation would require about 2x the computational resources.

Abstract: Data selection for finetuning Large Language Models (LLMs) can be framed as a
budget-constrained optimization problem: maximizing a model's downstream
performance under a strict training data budget. Solving this problem is
generally intractable, and existing approximate approaches are
pretraining-oriented and transfer poorly to the fine-tuning setting. We
reformulate this problem as a tractable Markov Decision Process (MDP) and train
agents using various Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods to learn optimal data
selection policies, guided by an efficient, proxy-model-based reward signal.
Across four datasets, training on a $5\%$ subset selected by our approach
matches or outperforms fine-tuning on the full dataset by up to $10.8$ accuracy
points, while cutting wall-clock training time by up to $2 \times$,
highlighting the promise of RL-guided data selection.

Abstract: Policy-gradient methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) are
typically updated along a single stochastic gradient direction, leaving the
rich local structure of the parameter space unexplored. Previous work has shown
that the surrogate gradient is often poorly correlated with the true reward
landscape. Building on this insight, we visualize the parameter space spanned
by policy checkpoints within an iteration and reveal that higher performing
solutions often lie in nearby unexplored regions. To exploit this opportunity,
we introduce ExploRLer, a pluggable pipeline that seamlessly integrates with
on-policy algorithms such as PPO and TRPO, systematically probing the
unexplored neighborhoods of surrogate on-policy gradient updates. Without
increasing the number of gradient updates, ExploRLer achieves significant
improvements over baselines in complex continuous control environments. Our
results demonstrate that iteration-level exploration provides a practical and
effective way to strengthen on-policy reinforcement learning and offer a fresh
perspective on the limitations of the surrogate objective.

TL;DR: 提出了MS-PAFL框架，通过模型分割和隐私放大技术解决联邦学习中差分隐私导致的精度下降问题，在保证隐私的同时显著提升模型准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中采用差分隐私保护客户端数据时，添加的噪声会严重降低模型精度，需要找到既能保护隐私又能保持模型性能的解决方案。

Method: 将客户端模型分割为私有子模型（本地保留）和公共子模型（全局聚合），仅在公共子模型注入校准高斯噪声，结合随机客户端参与和本地数据子采样实现隐私放大。

Result: 理论分析证明了该框架能显著降低满足目标隐私保护水平所需的噪声量，实验验证MS-PAFL在强隐私保证下能训练出高精度模型，实现优越的隐私-效用权衡。

Conclusion: MS-PAFL通过模型分割和隐私放大机制，有效解决了联邦学习中隐私保护与模型性能的权衡问题，为隐私保护机器学习提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) often adopts differential privacy (DP) to protect
client data, but the added noise required for privacy guarantees can
substantially degrade model accuracy. To resolve this challenge, we propose
model-splitting privacy-amplified federated learning (MS-PAFL), a novel
framework that combines structural model splitting with statistical privacy
amplification. In this framework, each client's model is partitioned into a
private submodel, retained locally, and a public submodel, shared for global
aggregation. The calibrated Gaussian noise is injected only into the public
submodel, thereby confining its adverse impact while preserving the utility of
the local model. We further present a rigorous theoretical analysis that
characterizes the joint privacy amplification achieved through random client
participation and local data subsampling under this architecture. The analysis
provides tight bounds on both single-round and total privacy loss,
demonstrating that MS-PAFL significantly reduces the noise necessary to satisfy
a target privacy protection level. Extensive experiments validate our
theoretical findings, showing that MS-PAFL consistently attains a superior
privacy-utility trade-off and enables the training of highly accurate models
under strong privacy guarantees.

Conclusion: 论文验证了多重神经预测定理，建立了动态性能边界，并为未来研究指明了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Neural Forecasters (NFs) are a cornerstone of Long-term Time Series
Forecasting (LTSF). However, progress has been hampered by an overemphasis on
architectural complexity at the expense of fundamental forecasting principles.
In this work, we return to first principles to redesign the LTSF paradigm. We
begin by introducing a Multiple Neural Forecasting Theorem that provides a
theoretical basis for our approach. We propose Boosted Direct Output (BDO), a
novel forecasting strategy that synergistically combines the advantages of both
Auto-Regressive (AR) and Direct Output (DO). In addition, we stabilize the
learning process by smoothly tracking the model's parameters. Extensive
experiments show that these principled improvements enable a simple MLP to
achieve state-of-the-art performance, outperforming recent, complex models in
nearly all cases, without any specific considerations in the area. Finally, we
empirically verify our theorem, establishing a dynamic performance bound and
identifying promising directions for future research. The code for review is

Abstract: Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (DLGNs) are a very fast and
energy-efficient alternative to conventional feed-forward networks. With
learnable combinations of logical gates, DLGNs enable fast inference by
hardware-friendly execution. Since the concept of DLGNs has only recently
gained attention, these networks are still in their developmental infancy,
including the design and scalability of their output layer. To date, this
architecture has primarily been tested on datasets with up to ten classes.
  This work examines the behavior of DLGNs on large multi-class datasets. We
investigate its general expressiveness, its scalability, and evaluate
alternative output strategies. Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we
provide key insights into the importance of temperature tuning and its impact
on output layer performance. We evaluate conditions under which the Group-Sum
layer performs well and how it can be applied to large-scale classification of
up to 2000 classes.

Abstract: Simultaneously optimizing multiple, frequently conflicting, molecular
properties is a key bottleneck in the development of novel therapeutics.
Although a promising approach, the efficacy of multi-task learning is often
compromised by destructive gradient interference, especially in the data-scarce
regimes common to drug discovery. To address this, we propose AIM, an
optimization framework that learns a dynamic policy to mediate gradient
conflicts. The policy is trained jointly with the main network using a novel
augmented objective composed of dense, differentiable regularizers. This
objective guides the policy to produce updates that are geometrically stable
and dynamically efficient, prioritizing progress on the most challenging tasks.
We demonstrate that AIM achieves statistically significant improvements over
multi-task baselines on subsets of the QM9 and targeted protein degraders
benchmarks, with its advantage being most pronounced in data-scarce regimes.
Beyond performance, AIM's key contribution is its interpretability; the learned
policy matrix serves as a diagnostic tool for analyzing inter-task
relationships. This combination of data-efficient performance and diagnostic
insight highlights the potential of adaptive optimizers to accelerate
scientific discovery by creating more robust and insightful models for
multi-property molecular design.

Abstract: Autonomous Raman instruments on Mars rovers, deep-sea landers, and field
robots must interpret raw spectra distorted by fluorescence baselines, peak
shifts, and limited ground-truth labels. Using curated subsets of the RRUFF
database, we evaluate one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
report four advances: (i) Baseline-independent classification: compact CNNs
surpass $k$-nearest-neighbors and support-vector machines on handcrafted
features, removing background-correction and peak-picking stages while ensuring
reproducibility through released data splits and scripts. (ii)
Pooling-controlled robustness: tuning a single pooling parameter accommodates
Raman shifts up to $30 \,\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, balancing translational invariance
with spectral resolution. (iii) Label-efficient learning: semi-supervised
generative adversarial networks and contrastive pretraining raise accuracy by
up to $11\%$ with only $10\%$ labels, valuable for autonomous deployments with
scarce annotation. (iv) Constant-time adaptation: freezing the CNN backbone and
retraining only the softmax layer transfers models to unseen minerals at
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ cost, outperforming Siamese networks on resource-limited
processors. This workflow, which involves training on raw spectra, tuning
pooling, adding semi-supervision when labels are scarce, and fine-tuning
lightly for new targets, provides a practical path toward robust, low-footprint
Raman classification in autonomous exploration.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm across multiple
entities while preserving data privacy. However, with the continuous emergence
of new data and increasing model diversity, traditional federated learning
faces significant challenges, including inherent issues of data heterogeneity,
model heterogeneity and catastrophic forgetting, along with new challenge of
knowledge misalignment. In this study, we introduce FedDCL, a novel framework
designed to enable data-free continual learning of the server model in a
model-heterogeneous federated setting. We leverage pre-trained diffusion models
to extract lightweight class-specific prototypes, which confer a threefold
data-free advantage, enabling: (1) generation of synthetic data for the current
task to augment training and counteract non-IID data distributions; (2)
exemplar-free generative replay for retaining knowledge from previous tasks;
and (3) data-free dynamic knowledge transfer from heterogeneous clients to the
server. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of FedDCL, showcasing its potential to enhance the generalizability and
practical applicability of federated learning in dynamic settings.

Conclusion: 通过结合泛化理论和认证鲁棒性分析，提出了一种有效的谱正则化方法，能够同时保证平滑多数投票分类器的泛化性能和认证鲁棒性。

Abstract: Within the PAC-Bayesian framework, the Gibbs classifier (defined on a
posterior $Q$) and the corresponding $Q$-weighted majority vote classifier are
commonly used to analyze the generalization performance. However, there exists
a notable lack in theoretical research exploring the certified robustness of
majority vote classifier and its interplay with generalization. In this study,
we develop a generalization error bound that possesses a certified robust
radius for the smoothed majority vote classifier (i.e., the $Q$-weighted
majority vote classifier with smoothed inputs); In other words, the
generalization bound holds under any data perturbation within the certified
robust radius. As a byproduct, we find that the underpinnings of both the
generalization bound and the certified robust radius draw, in part, upon weight
spectral norm, which thereby inspires the adoption of spectral regularization
in smooth training to boost certified robustness. Utilizing the
dimension-independent property of spherical Gaussian inputs in smooth training,
we propose a novel and inexpensive spectral regularizer to enhance the smoothed
majority vote classifier. In addition to the theoretical contribution, a set of
empirical results is provided to substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed
method.

Conclusion: 量子薛定谔桥问题通过引入玻姆势体现了量子系统的非局域性特征，其在高斯分布间的精确解为生成建模提供了新的理论基础和实用算法框架。

Abstract: The Quantum Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem (QSBP) describes the evolution of a
stochastic process between two arbitrary probability distributions, where the
dynamics are governed by the Schr\"odinger equation rather than by the
traditional real-valued wave equation. Although the QSBP is known in the
mathematical literature, we formulate it here from a Lagrangian perspective and
derive its main features in a way that is particularly suited to generative
modeling. We show that the resulting evolution equations involve the so-called
Bohm (quantum) potential, representing a notion of non-locality in the
stochastic process. This distinguishes the QSBP from classical stochastic
dynamics and reflects a key characteristic typical of quantum mechanical
systems. In this work, we derive exact closed-form solutions for the QSBP
between Gaussian distributions. Our derivation is based on solving the
Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE) and the Hamilton-Jacobi Equation (HJE) arising
from the Lagrangian formulation of dynamical Optimal Transport. We find that,
similar to the classical Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem, the solution to the QSBP
between Gaussians is again a Gaussian process; however, the evolution of the
covariance differs due to quantum effects. Leveraging these explicit solutions,
we present a modified algorithm based on a Gaussian Mixture Model framework,
and demonstrate its effectiveness across several experimental settings,
including single-cell evolution data, image generation, molecular translation
and applications in Mean-Field Games.

Abstract: Sparsity-aware training is an effective approach for transforming large
language models (LLMs) into hardware-friendly sparse patterns, thereby reducing
latency and memory consumption during inference. In this paper, we propose
Continuous Adaptive Sparse Trainer (CAST), a fully continuous and
differentiable sparsity-aware training framework for semi-structured (or "N:M")
sparse models. Unlike previous approaches that optimize sparsity patterns and
weights separately, CAST enables seamless joint optimization during training,
while progressively transforming the model into the desired sparsity format.
Specifically, CAST introduces three key components: 1) AdamS, a sparsity-aware
optimizer that leverages adaptive L1 decay to promote uniform sparsification
across all parameters; 2) Weight Scaling, a module designed to mitigate the
magnitude reduction caused by decay while preserving desired sparsity patterns;
3) Knowledge Distillation, which employs the dense model as a self-teacher to
enhance training efficiency. We evaluate CAST under 2:4 sparsity patterns
across multiple model families, ranging from 125M to 13B parameters. Our
results demonstrate significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art
methods in both perplexity and zero-shot accuracy with minimal training
resources. Notably, on LLaMA2-7B, our 2:4 sparse model achieves a negligible
perplexity increase of 0.09 and a 0.36% gain in zero-shot accuracy compared to
the dense model using only 2% of the original pretraining tokens. Additionally,
we establish an accurate and robust empirical scaling law to predict sparse
model performance given adequate training resources. Finally, we demonstrate
the practical applicability of our sparse models by evaluating them under
quantization and fine-tuning scenarios.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning in partially observable environments requires agents
to act under uncertainty from noisy, incomplete observations. Asymmetric
actor-critic methods leverage privileged information during training to improve
learning under these conditions. However, existing approaches typically assume
full-state access during training. In this work, we challenge this assumption
by proposing a novel actor-critic framework, called informed asymmetric
actor-critic, that enables conditioning the critic on arbitrary privileged
signals without requiring access to the full state. We show that policy
gradients remain unbiased under this formulation, extending the theoretical
foundation of asymmetric methods to the more general case of privileged partial
information. To quantify the impact of such signals, we propose informativeness
measures based on kernel methods and return prediction error, providing
practical tools for evaluating training-time signals. We validate our approach
empirically on benchmark navigation tasks and synthetic partially observable
environments, showing that our informed asymmetric method improves learning
efficiency and value estimation when informative privileged inputs are
available. Our findings challenge the necessity of full-state access and open
new directions for designing asymmetric reinforcement learning methods that are
both practical and theoretically sound.

Conclusion: 间接注意力机制能够有效处理键值对来自不同序列或模态时产生的上下文不对齐问题，在噪声值特征和不对齐场景下表现优于标准注意力机制。

Abstract: The attention mechanism has become a cornerstone of modern deep learning
architectures, where keys and values are typically derived from the same
underlying sequence or representation. This work explores a less conventional
scenario, when keys and values originate from different sequences or
modalities. Specifically, we first analyze the attention mechanism's behavior
under noisy value features, establishing a critical noise threshold beyond
which signal degradation becomes significant. Furthermore, we model context
(key, value) misalignment as an effective form of structured noise within the
value features, demonstrating that the noise induced by such misalignment can
substantially exceed this critical threshold, thereby compromising standard
attention's efficacy. Motivated by this, we introduce Indirect Attention, a
modified attention mechanism that infers relevance indirectly in scenarios with
misaligned context. We evaluate the performance of Indirect Attention across a
range of synthetic tasks and real world applications, showcasing its superior
ability to handle misalignment.

Abstract: Access to credible sustainability information in the fashion industry remains
limited and challenging to interpret, despite growing public and regulatory
demands for transparency. General-purpose language models often lack
domain-specific knowledge and tend to "hallucinate", which is particularly
harmful for fields where factual correctness is crucial. This work explores how
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can be applied to classify
sustainability data for fashion brands, thereby addressing the scarcity of
credible and accessible information in this domain. We present a prototype
Fashion Information Tool for Sustainability (FITS), a transformer-based system
that extracts and classifies sustainability information from credible,
unstructured text sources: NGO reports and scientific publications. Several
BERT-based language models, including models pretrained on scientific and
climate-specific data, are fine-tuned on our curated corpus using a
domain-specific classification schema, with hyperparameters optimized via
Bayesian optimization. FITS allows users to search for relevant data, analyze
their own data, and explore the information via an interactive interface. We
evaluated FITS in two focus groups of potential users concerning usability,
visual design, content clarity, possible use cases, and desired features. Our
results highlight the value of domain-adapted NLP in promoting informed
decision-making and emphasize the broader potential of AI applications in
addressing climate-related challenges. Finally, this work provides a valuable
dataset, the SustainableTextileCorpus, along with a methodology for future
updates. Code available at https://github.com/daphne12345/FITS

TL;DR: Muon优化器在训练大语言模型时比Adam更快，其成功机制源于对关联记忆参数（VO注意力权重和FFN）的优化，在重尾数据分布下能更有效地学习尾部类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释Muon优化器相比Adam在大语言模型训练中表现更优的机制，特别是其在重尾数据分布下的优势。

Method: 通过消融实验分析Transformer组件，从关联记忆角度解释Muon的优势，并在理论和实验上验证其在重尾数据下的表现。

Result: Muon的更新规则产生更各向同性的奇异谱，在重尾数据中能更有效地优化尾部类别，而Adam可能因嵌入特性导致学习误差差异。

Conclusion: Muon的核心优势在于其更新规则与线性关联记忆的外积结构对齐，在重尾分布下能实现比Adam更平衡和有效的尾部类别学习。

Abstract: The Muon optimizer is consistently faster than Adam in training Large
Language Models (LLMs), yet the mechanism underlying its success remains
unclear. This paper demystifies this mechanism through the lens of associative
memory. By ablating the transformer components optimized by Muon, we reveal
that the associative memory parameters of LLMs, namely the Value and Output
(VO) attention weights and Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs), are the primary
contributors to Muon's superiority. Motivated by this associative memory view,
we then explain Muon's superiority on real-world corpora, which are
intrinsically heavy-tailed: a few classes (tail classes) appear far less
frequently than others. The superiority is explained through two key
properties: (i) its update rule consistently yields a more isotropic singular
spectrum than Adam; and as a result, (ii) on heavy-tailed data, it optimizes
tail classes more effectively than Adam. Beyond empirical evidence, we
theoretically confirm these findings by analyzing a one-layer associative
memory model under class-imbalanced data. We prove that Muon consistently
achieves balanced learning across classes regardless of feature embeddings,
whereas Adam can induce large disparities in learning errors depending on
embedding properties. In summary, our empirical observations and theoretical
analyses reveal Muon's core advantage: its update rule aligns with the
outer-product structure of linear associative memories, enabling more balanced
and effective learning of tail classes in heavy-tailed distributions than Adam.

TL;DR: DPSBA是一个针对图神经网络的干净标签后门攻击框架，通过对抗训练学习分布内触发器，有效抑制结构和语义异常，在保持高攻击成功率的同时显著提升隐蔽性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图分类后门攻击方法存在结构异常（罕见子图触发器）和语义异常（标签翻转）问题，使得中毒图容易被异常检测模型发现，需要更隐蔽的攻击方法。

Method: 提出DPSBA框架，通过对抗训练学习分布内触发器，使用异常感知判别器指导训练过程，同时抑制结构和语义异常。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，DPSBA在攻击有效性和可检测性之间达到了优越的平衡，相比现有基线方法表现更好。

Conclusion: DPSBA通过抑制结构和语义异常，实现了既有效又隐蔽的图分类后门攻击，为图神经网络的安全研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong performance across
tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification,
but remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks that implant imperceptible triggers
during training to control predictions. While node-level attacks exploit local
message passing, graph-level attacks face the harder challenge of manipulating
global representations while maintaining stealth. We identify two main sources
of anomaly in existing graph classification backdoor methods: structural
deviation from rare subgraph triggers and semantic deviation caused by label
flipping, both of which make poisoned graphs easily detectable by anomaly
detection models. To address this, we propose DPSBA, a clean-label backdoor
framework that learns in-distribution triggers via adversarial training guided
by anomaly-aware discriminators. DPSBA effectively suppresses both structural
and semantic anomalies, achieving high attack success while significantly
improving stealth. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate that
DPSBA achieves a superior balance between effectiveness and detectability
compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Temporal Experts Averaging (TEA)框架，通过权重平均更新整个模型来解决时序域泛化问题，在保持计算效率的同时最大化泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常只预测分类器层权重，无法调整其他模型组件，限制了泛化能力；而预测完整模型权重计算成本过高。

Method: 1) 在保持参数相似性的前提下，通过在单个时序域上微调基础模型创建功能多样化的专家模型；2) 在主成分子空间中建模时序权重轨迹，通过自适应平均系数优化偏差-方差权衡。

Result: 在7个TDG基准测试、5个模型和2种TDG设置中，TEA比现有方法性能提升高达69%，同时效率提升高达60倍。

Conclusion: TEA框架通过权重平均有效解决了时序域泛化问题，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了模型对未来域的泛化能力。

Abstract: Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) aims to generalize across temporal
distribution shifts, e.g., lexical change over time. Prior work often addresses
this by predicting future model weights. However, full model prediction is
prohibitively expensive for even reasonably sized models. Thus, recent methods
only predict the classifier layer, limiting generalization by failing to adjust
other model components. To address this, we propose Temporal Experts Averaging
(TEA), a novel and scalable TDG framework that updates the entire model using
weight averaging to maximize generalization potential while minimizing
computational costs. Our theoretical analysis guides us to two steps that
enhance generalization to future domains. First, we create expert models with
functional diversity yet parameter similarity by fine-tuning a domain-agnostic
base model on individual temporal domains while constraining weight changes.
Second, we optimize the bias-variance tradeoff through adaptive averaging
coefficients derived from modeling temporal weight trajectories in a principal
component subspace. Expert's contributions are based on their projected
proximity to future domains. Extensive experiments across 7 TDG benchmarks, 5
models, and 2 TDG settings shows TEA outperforms prior TDG methods by up to 69%
while being up to 60x more efficient.

### [338] [Clip-Low Increases Entropy and Clip-High Decreases Entropy in Reinforcement Learning of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26114)
*Jaesung R. Park,Junsu Kim,Gyeongman Kim,Jinyoung Jo,Sean Choi,Jaewoong Cho,Ernest K. Ryu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PPO和GRPO中的裁剪机制会导致熵偏差，clip-low增加熵，clip-high减少熵。在标准参数下，clip-high主导导致整体熵减少，即使提供随机奖励也会发生。通过调整clip-low可以控制熵，防止RLVR训练中的熵崩溃。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR方法在增强大语言模型推理能力方面表现出色，但容易发生熵崩溃，导致模型快速收敛到近乎确定性的形式，阻碍探索和长期训练进展。

Method: 通过理论和实证分析PPO和GRPO中的裁剪机制对熵的影响，揭示clip-low和clip-high对熵的不同作用机制。

Result: 研究发现裁剪机制独立于奖励信号影响熵，clip-low增加熵，clip-high减少熵。在标准参数下clip-high主导导致整体熵减少。

Conclusion: 裁剪机制是RLVR中被忽视的混杂因素，可以通过调整clip-low值来主动控制熵，增加探索性，防止熵崩溃。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
the leading approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). However, RLVR is prone to entropy collapse, where the LLM
quickly converges to a near-deterministic form, hindering exploration and
progress during prolonged RL training. In this work, we reveal that the
clipping mechanism in PPO and GRPO induces biases on entropy. Through
theoretical and empirical analyses, we show that clip-low increases entropy,
while clip-high decreases it. Further, under standard clipping parameters, the
effect of clip-high dominates, resulting in an overall entropy reduction even
when purely random rewards are provided to the RL algorithm. Our findings
highlight an overlooked confounding factor in RLVR: independent of the reward
signal, the clipping mechanism influences entropy, which in turn affects the
reasoning behavior. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that clipping can be
deliberately used to control entropy. Specifically, with a more aggressive
clip-low value, one can increase entropy, promote exploration, and ultimately
prevent entropy collapse in RLVR training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UncertainGen是首个用于宏基因组分箱的概率嵌入方法，通过将DNA片段表示为潜在空间中的概率分布来建模序列不确定性，相比确定性方法能更好地处理物种间DNA共享和相似片段的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的宏基因组分箱方法依赖确定性表示（如k-mer谱或大语言模型嵌入），无法捕捉DNA序列中固有的不确定性，这些不确定性源于物种间DNA共享和具有高度相似表示的片段。

Method: 提出概率嵌入方法UncertainGen，将每个DNA片段表示为潜在空间中的概率分布，引入数据自适应度量来扩展可行潜在空间，从而实现更灵活的分箱/聚类分离。

Result: 在真实宏基因组数据集上的实验表明，相比确定性k-mer和基于LLM的嵌入方法，该方法在分箱任务上有所改进，为大规模宏基因组分析提供了可扩展的轻量级解决方案。

Conclusion: 概率嵌入框架通过建模序列级不确定性，提供了更灵活的分箱分离能力，在宏基因组分箱任务上优于现有确定性方法。

Abstract: Metagenomic binning aims to cluster DNA fragments from mixed microbial
samples into their respective genomes, a critical step for downstream analyses
of microbial communities. Existing methods rely on deterministic
representations, such as k-mer profiles or embeddings from large language
models, which fail to capture the uncertainty inherent in DNA sequences arising
from inter-species DNA sharing and from fragments with highly similar
representations. We present the first probabilistic embedding approach,
UncertainGen, for metagenomic binning, representing each DNA fragment as a
probability distribution in latent space. Our approach naturally models
sequence-level uncertainty, and we provide theoretical guarantees on embedding
distinguishability. This probabilistic embedding framework expands the feasible
latent space by introducing a data-adaptive metric, which in turn enables more
flexible separation of bins/clusters. Experiments on real metagenomic datasets
demonstrate the improvements over deterministic k-mer and LLM-based embeddings
for the binning task by offering a scalable and lightweight solution for
large-scale metagenomic analysis.

TL;DR: 本文分析了超维计算(HDC)在智能制造中的应用，发现HDC参数与性能的关系在不同应用场景中并不稳定。通过信号质量监控和图像缺陷检测两个代表性任务，揭示了编码器类型、投影方差、维度等参数对性能的影响，并开发出匹配或超越深度学习模型性能的HDC方案，推理速度快6倍，训练能耗低40倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能制造需要在严格延迟和能耗预算下实现设备端智能。超维计算(HDC)提供了一种轻量级替代方案，但先前研究假设HDC超参数与性能的定性关系在不同应用中稳定，这一假设需要验证。

Method: 分析两个代表性任务：CNC加工中的信号质量监控和LPBF中的图像缺陷检测。研究编码器类型、投影方差、超维维度、数据量等参数如何影响精度、推理延迟、训练时间和训练能耗。建立形式化复杂度模型解释可预测趋势。

Result: 信号任务偏好非线性随机傅里叶特征编码，图像任务偏好线性随机投影编码。调优后的HDC模型匹配或超越最先进的深度学习和Transformer模型精度，同时提供至少6倍更快的推理速度和40倍更低的训练能耗。

Conclusion: 领域感知的HDC编码是必要的，调优后的HDC为受限硬件上的实时工业AI提供了实用、可扩展的路径。未来工作将实现自适应编码器和超参数选择，扩展到更多制造模式，并在低功耗加速器上验证。

Abstract: Smart manufacturing requires on-device intelligence that meets strict latency
and energy budgets. HyperDimensional Computing (HDC) offers a lightweight
alternative by encoding data as high-dimensional hypervectors and computing
with simple operations. Prior studies often assume that the qualitative
relation between HDC hyperparameters and performance is stable across
applications. Our analysis of two representative tasks, signal-based quality
monitoring in Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining and image-based defect
detection in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF), shows that this assumption does
not hold. We map how encoder type, projection variance, hypervector
dimensionality, and data regime shape accuracy, inference latency, training
time, and training energy. A formal complexity model explains predictable
trends in encoding and similarity computation and reveals nonmonotonic
interactions with retraining that preclude a closed-form optimum. Empirically,
signals favor nonlinear Random Fourier Features with more exclusive encodings
and saturate in accuracy beyond moderate dimensionality. Images favor linear
Random Projection, achieve high accuracy with small dimensionality, and depend
more on sample count than on dimensionality. Guided by these insights, we tune
HDC under multiobjective constraints that reflect edge deployment and obtain
models that match or exceed the accuracy of state-of-the-art deep learning and
Transformer models while delivering at least 6x faster inference and more than
40x lower training energy. These results demonstrate that domain-aware HDC
encoding is necessary and that tuned HDC offers a practical, scalable path to
real-time industrial AI on constrained hardware. Future work will enable
adaptive encoder and hyperparameter selection, expand evaluation to additional
manufacturing modalities, and validate on low-power accelerators.

Conclusion: 所提算法能有效加速Transformer训练，提高稳定性，并显著降低计算需求，为Transformer在强化学习中的应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The appearance of transformer-based models in Reinforcement Learning (RL) has
expanded the horizons of possibilities in robotics tasks, but it has
simultaneously brought a wide range of challenges during its implementation,
especially in model-free online RL. Some of the existing learning algorithms
cannot be easily implemented with transformer-based models due to the
instability of the latter. In this paper, we propose a method that uses the
Accelerator policy as a transformer's trainer. The Accelerator, a simpler and
more stable model, interacts with the environment independently while
simultaneously training the transformer through behavior cloning during the
first stage of the proposed algorithm. In the second stage, the pretrained
transformer starts to interact with the environment in a fully online setting.
As a result, this model-free algorithm accelerates the transformer in terms of
its performance and helps it to train online in a more stable and faster way.
By conducting experiments on both state-based and image-based ManiSkill
environments, as well as on MuJoCo tasks in MDP and POMDP settings, we show
that applying our algorithm not only enables stable training of transformers
but also reduces training time on image-based environments by up to a factor of
two. Moreover, it decreases the required replay buffer size in off-policy
methods to 10-20 thousand, which significantly lowers the overall computational
demands.

Abstract: There is high demand on fire simulations, in both scale and quantity. We
present a multi-pronged approach to improving the time and energy required to
meet these demands. We show the ability of a custom machine learning surrogate
model to predict the dynamics of heat propagation orders of magnitude faster
than state-of-the-art CFD software for this application. We also demonstrate
how a guided optimisation procedure can decrease the number of simulations
required to meet an objective; using lightweight models to decide which
simulations to run, we see a tenfold reduction when locating the most dangerous
location for a fire to occur within a building based on the impact of smoke on
visibility. Finally we present a framework and product, Simvue, through which
we access these tools along with a host of automatic organisational and
tracking features which enables future reuse of data and more savings through
better management of simulations and combating redundancy.

Method: 引入对齐感知解码(AAD)，在推理阶段通过隐式奖励优化来增强模型对齐，仅需标准DPO设置

Result: AAD在不同对齐基准测试和模型规模上始终优于强基线，在数据受限情况下还能生成高质量合成数据

Conclusion: AAD为模型对齐提供了一种实用的推理时解决方案，特别是在标注数据有限的情况下

Abstract: Alignment of large language models remains a central challenge in natural
language processing. Preference optimization has emerged as a popular and
effective method for improving alignment, typically through training-time or
prompt-based interventions. In this paper, we introduce alignment-aware
decoding (AAD), a method to enhance model alignment directly at inference.
Theoretically, AAD can be interpreted as implicit reward optimization, yet it
requires no specialized training beyond the standard DPO setup. Empirically,
AAD consistently outperforms strong baselines across diverse alignment
benchmarks and model scales. Moreover, in data-constrained settings, AAD can
produce high-quality synthetic data to improve alignment under standard
decoding, providing a practical solution when labeled data is limited.

Abstract: Mapping informal settlements is crucial for addressing challenges related to
urban planning, public health, and infrastructure in rapidly growing cities.
Geospatial machine learning has emerged as a key tool for detecting and mapping
these areas from remote sensing data. However, existing approaches often treat
spatial units independently, neglecting the relational structure of the urban
fabric. We propose a graph-based framework that explicitly incorporates local
geographical context into the classification process. Each spatial unit (cell)
is embedded in a graph structure along with its adjacent neighbors, and a
lightweight Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is trained to classify whether
the central cell belongs to an informal settlement. Experiments are conducted
on a case study in Rio de Janeiro using spatial cross-validation across five
distinct zones, ensuring robustness and generalizability across heterogeneous
urban landscapes. Our method outperforms standard baselines, improving Kappa
coefficient by 17 points over individual cell classification. We also show that
graph-based modeling surpasses simple feature concatenation of neighboring
cells, demonstrating the benefit of encoding spatial structure for urban scene
understanding.

Conclusion: 严格局部性与可学习时间步进相结合为神经PDE求解器提供了准确且可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Neural operator models for solving partial differential equations (PDEs)
often rely on global mixing mechanisms-such as spectral convolutions or
attention-which tend to oversmooth sharp local dynamics and introduce high
computational cost. We present FINO, a finite-difference-inspired neural
architecture that enforces strict locality while retaining multiscale
representational power. FINO replaces fixed finite-difference stencil
coefficients with learnable convolutional kernels and evolves states via an
explicit, learnable time-stepping scheme. A central Local Operator Block
leverage a differential stencil layer, a gating mask, and a linear fuse step to
construct adaptive derivative-like local features that propagate forward in
time. Embedded in an encoder-decoder with a bottleneck, FINO captures
fine-grained local structures while preserving interpretability. We establish
(i) a composition error bound linking one-step approximation error to stable
long-horizon rollouts under a Lipschitz condition, and (ii) a universal
approximation theorem for discrete time-stepped PDE dynamics. (iii) Across six
benchmarks and a climate modelling task, FINO achieves up to 44\% lower error
and up to around 2\times speedups over state-of-the-art operator-learning
baselines, demonstrating that strict locality with learnable time-stepping
yields an accurate and scalable foundation for neural PDE solvers.

Motivation: 传统HVAC系统在确保室内环境质量时能耗过高，需要开发既能优化室内环境又能提高能源效率的智能管理方法。

Method: 使用从净零能耗学术建筑收集的ROBOD数据集，对LSTM、GRU和CNN-LSTM三种深度学习架构进行基准测试，预测CO2浓度、温度和湿度等IEQ参数。

Result: GRU在短期预测中表现最佳且计算开销较低，CNN-LSTM在长期预测中特征提取能力更强，LSTM在长时间序列建模方面稳健。预测可靠性受数据分辨率、传感器位置和人员流动影响。

Abstract: Ensuring optimal Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) is vital for occupant
health and productivity, yet it often comes at a high energy cost in
conventional Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. This
paper proposes a deep learning driven approach to proactively manage IEQ
parameters specifically CO2 concentration, temperature, and humidity while
balancing building energy efficiency. Leveraging the ROBOD dataset collected
from a net-zero energy academic building, we benchmark three
architectures--Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and
a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network LSTM (CNN-LSTM)--to forecast IEQ
variables across various time horizons. Our results show that GRU achieves the
best short-term prediction accuracy with lower computational overhead, whereas
CNN-LSTM excels in extracting dominant features for extended forecasting
windows. Meanwhile, LSTM offers robust long-range temporal modeling. The
comparative analysis highlights that prediction reliability depends on data
resolution, sensor placement, and fluctuating occupancy conditions. These
findings provide actionable insights for intelligent Building Management
Systems (BMS) to implement predictive HVAC control, thereby reducing energy
consumption and enhancing occupant comfort in real-world building operations.

TL;DR: 提出Marginal Flow框架，通过参数化分布和潜在参数采样，克服现有密度建模方法的训练昂贵、推理缓慢、似然近似等局限性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有密度建模方法存在训练昂贵、推理缓慢、近似似然、模式崩溃或双射映射等架构约束等缺陷，需要一种能同时克服这些限制的简单而强大的框架

Method: 通过参数化分布q(x|w)定义模型，其中w为潜在参数。不直接优化w，而是从可学习分布qθ(w)中采样w来边缘化这些参数，从而实现高效密度评估和采样

Result: Marginal Flow允许精确密度评估，在训练和推理上比竞争模型快几个数量级。该框架灵活，不限制神经网络架构，能学习低维流形分布，可高效训练且易处理多模态目标

Conclusion: Marginal Flow是一个简单而强大的密度建模框架，在合成数据集、基于模拟的推理、正定矩阵分布和图像潜在空间流形学习等各种任务中表现出色

Abstract: Current density modeling approaches suffer from at least one of the following
shortcomings: expensive training, slow inference, approximate likelihood, mode
collapse or architectural constraints like bijective mappings. We propose a
simple yet powerful framework that overcomes these limitations altogether. We
define our model $q_\theta(x)$ through a parametric distribution $q(x|w)$ with
latent parameters $w$. Instead of directly optimizing the latent variables $w$,
our idea is to marginalize them out by sampling $w$ from a learnable
distribution $q_\theta(w)$, hence the name Marginal Flow. In order to evaluate
the learned density $q_\theta(x)$ or to sample from it, we only need to draw
samples from $q_\theta(w)$, which makes both operations efficient. The proposed
model allows for exact density evaluation and is orders of magnitude faster
than competing models both at training and inference. Furthermore, Marginal
Flow is a flexible framework: it does not impose any restrictions on the neural
network architecture, it enables learning distributions on lower-dimensional
manifolds (either known or to be learned), it can be trained efficiently with
any objective (e.g. forward and reverse KL divergence), and it easily handles
multi-modal targets. We evaluate Marginal Flow extensively on various tasks
including synthetic datasets, simulation-based inference, distributions on
positive definite matrices and manifold learning in latent spaces of images.

TL;DR: TFPI通过简单的ThinkFree操作减少RLVR训练中的上下文长度，提升性能并降低计算成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR方法虽然有效但需要极长的上下文长度，导致计算成本高昂。多阶段训练方法容易因初始上下文过短导致性能不可逆下降

Method: 引入TFPI方法，通过ThinkFree操作显式丢弃思考内容来减少推理时的token使用，在训练中使用ThinkFree适配的输入

Result: TFPI加速了RL收敛，达到更高性能上限，生成更token高效推理模型。4B模型在AIME24达到89.0%准确率，LiveCodeBench达到65.5%

Conclusion: TFPI是简单有效的RLVR适配方法，无需专门奖励或复杂训练设计即可显著提升性能和效率

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) effectively solves
complex tasks but demands extremely long context lengths during training,
leading to substantial computational costs. While multi-stage training can
partially mitigate this, starting with overly short contexts often causes
irreversible performance degradation, ultimately failing to reduce overall
training compute significantly. In this paper, we introduce
**T**hinking-**F**ree **P**olicy **I**nitialization (**TFPI**), a simple yet
effective adaptation to RLVR that bridges long Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
distillation and standard RLVR. TFPI employs a simple *ThinkFree* operation,
explicitly discarding the thinking content via a direct *</think>* append, to
reduce token usage during inference. Training with *ThinkFree*-adapted inputs
improves performance and lowers token consumption, even in the original
slow-thinking mode. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks have shown
that TFPI accelerates RL convergence, achieves a higher performance ceiling,
and yields more token-efficient reasoning models without specialized rewards or
complex training designs. With TFPI only, we train a 4B model to reach 89.0%
accuracy on AIME24 and 65.5% on LiveCodeBench using less than 4K H20 hours.

TL;DR: 提出了截断多项式分类器（TPCs），用于动态监控大语言模型的激活状态，实现按需计算的安全监控。TPCs可以逐项评估多项式，在测试时根据需要选择计算量，既能在简单输入时节省资源，又能在复杂情况下提供更强的安全保障。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统安全监控器对每个查询使用相同的计算量，导致在简单输入上浪费资源，而在复杂输入上可能漏检。需要一种灵活的安全监控方法，计算成本只在输入难以评估或计算资源充足时才增加。

Method: 引入截断多项式分类器（TPCs），这是线性探针的自然扩展。关键洞察是多项式可以逐项训练和评估，测试时可以根据需要提前停止（轻量监控）或使用更多项（更强防护）。提供两种使用模式：安全调节和自适应级联。

Result: 在两个大规模安全数据集（WildGuardMix和BeaverTails）上，对4个参数高达300亿的模型进行测试，TPCs在相同规模下与基于MLP的探针基线竞争或表现更优，同时比黑盒对应物更具可解释性。

Conclusion: TPCs提供了一种灵活高效的安全监控方法，能够在保证安全性的同时优化计算资源使用，为开发者和监管者提供了可调节的安全保障机制。

Abstract: Monitoring large language models' (LLMs) activations is an effective way to
detect harmful requests before they lead to unsafe outputs. However,
traditional safety monitors often require the same amount of compute for every
query. This creates a trade-off: expensive monitors waste resources on easy
inputs, while cheap ones risk missing subtle cases. We argue that safety
monitors should be flexible--costs should rise only when inputs are difficult
to assess, or when more compute is available. To achieve this, we introduce
Truncated Polynomial Classifiers (TPCs), a natural extension of linear probes
for dynamic activation monitoring. Our key insight is that polynomials can be
trained and evaluated progressively, term-by-term. At test-time, one can
early-stop for lightweight monitoring, or use more terms for stronger
guardrails when needed. TPCs provide two modes of use. First, as a safety dial:
by evaluating more terms, developers and regulators can "buy" stronger
guardrails from the same model. Second, as an adaptive cascade: clear cases
exit early after low-order checks, and higher-order guardrails are evaluated
only for ambiguous inputs, reducing overall monitoring costs. On two
large-scale safety datasets (WildGuardMix and BeaverTails), for 4 models with
up to 30B parameters, we show that TPCs compete with or outperform MLP-based
probe baselines of the same size, all the while being more interpretable than
their black-box counterparts. Our code is available at

Abstract: Evaluating the safety of frontier AI systems is an increasingly important
concern, helping to measure the capabilities of such models and identify risks
before deployment. However, it has been recognised that if AI agents are aware
that they are being evaluated, such agents may deliberately hide dangerous
capabilities or intentionally demonstrate suboptimal performance in
safety-related tasks in order to be released and to avoid being deactivated or
retrained. Such strategic deception - often known as "sandbagging" - threatens
to undermine the integrity of safety evaluations. For this reason, it is of
value to identify methods that enable us to distinguish behavioural patterns
that demonstrate a true lack of capability from behavioural patterns that are
consistent with sandbagging. In this paper, we develop a simple model of
strategic deception in sequential decision-making tasks, inspired by the
recently developed survival bandit framework. We demonstrate theoretically that
this problem induces sandbagging behaviour in optimal rational agents, and
construct a statistical test to distinguish between sandbagging and
incompetence from sequences of test scores. In simulation experiments, we
investigate the reliability of this test in allowing us to distinguish between
such behaviours in bandit models. This work aims to establish a potential
avenue for developing robust statistical procedures for use in the science of
frontier model evaluations.

*Ahmad-Reza Ehyaei,Golnoosh Farnadi,Samira Samadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Wasserstein分布鲁棒性的公平性认证框架，能够在分布偏移下提供最坏情况下的群体公平性保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的群体公平性指标在重采样和分布偏移下变化剧烈且不稳定，影响了审计的可靠性。

Method: 采用Wasserstein分布鲁棒框架，通过强对偶性推导出可处理的重新表述和高效估计器DRUNE。

Result: ε-WDF在标准基准和分类器上提供了稳定的公平性评估，在分布偏移下表现稳健。

Conclusion: 该框架为超越观测数据的群体公平性审计和认证提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Group-fairness metrics (e.g., equalized odds) can vary sharply across
resamples and are especially brittle under distribution shift, undermining
reliable audits. We propose a Wasserstein distributionally robust framework
that certifies worst-case group fairness over a ball of plausible test
distributions centered at the empirical law. Our formulation unifies common
group fairness notions via a generic conditional-probability functional and
defines $\varepsilon$-Wasserstein Distributional Fairness ($\varepsilon$-WDF)
as the audit target. Leveraging strong duality, we derive tractable
reformulations and an efficient estimator (DRUNE) for $\varepsilon$-WDF. We
prove feasibility and consistency and establish finite-sample certification
guarantees for auditing fairness, along with quantitative bounds under
smoothness and margin conditions. Across standard benchmarks and classifiers,
$\varepsilon$-WDF delivers stable fairness assessments under distribution
shift, providing a principled basis for auditing and certifying group fairness
beyond observational data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究很少将分布鲁棒优化应用于个体公平性问题，特别是在考虑因果结构和敏感属性的学习问题中，需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 首先从因果和个体公平视角构建DRO问题，提出DRO对偶形式，将近似最坏情况损失表征为闭式正则化器，消除min-max问题中的max步骤，并在更一般情况下估计正则化器。

Conclusion: 该方法能够确保学习过程的效率和鲁棒性，为处理个体公平性和因果结构的分布鲁棒优化问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) has
garnered substantial interest for its efficacy in data-driven decision-making
under distributional uncertainty. However, limited research has explored the
application of DRO to address individual fairness concerns, particularly when
considering causal structures and sensitive attributes in learning problems. To
address this gap, we first formulate the DRO problem from causality and
individual fairness perspectives. We then present the DRO dual formulation as
an efficient tool to convert the DRO problem into a more tractable and
computationally efficient form. Next, we characterize the closed form of the
approximate worst-case loss quantity as a regularizer, eliminating the max-step
in the min-max DRO problem. We further estimate the regularizer in more general
cases and explore the relationship between DRO and classical robust
optimization. Finally, by removing the assumption of a known structural causal
model, we provide finite sample error bounds when designing DRO with empirical
distributions and estimated causal structures to ensure efficiency and robust
learning.

TL;DR: 本文比较了生成模型在物理系统模拟中的表现，发现随机插值法比基于高斯噪声的方法更有效，能实现更少采样步骤和更准确预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型大多依赖迭代去噪高斯噪声，这可能不是PDE和动力系统（如气候）自回归预测任务的最有效选择。需要探索更适合物理系统模拟的生成建模方法。

Method: 使用随机插值法，直接学习当前状态与未来状态之间的随机过程，利用连续物理分布的邻近性。通过调整采样来平衡确定性精度、频谱一致性和概率校准。

Result: 随机插值法比基于高斯噪声传输的模型使用更少采样步骤，产生更准确预测，在不同物理领域和任务中表现出竞争优势。

Conclusion: 随机插值法可作为物理模拟的竞争性基准，为不同生成建模框架的能力提供见解，表明生成模型需要在多个性能指标间取得平衡。

Abstract: Generative models have recently emerged as powerful surrogates for physical
systems, demonstrating increased accuracy, stability, and/or statistical
fidelity. Most approaches rely on iteratively denoising a Gaussian, a choice
that may not be the most effective for autoregressive prediction tasks in PDEs
and dynamical systems such as climate. In this work, we benchmark generative
models across diverse physical domains and tasks, and highlight the role of
stochastic interpolants. By directly learning a stochastic process between
current and future states, stochastic interpolants can leverage the proximity
of successive physical distributions. This allows for generative models that
can use fewer sampling steps and produce more accurate predictions than models
relying on transporting Gaussian noise. Our experiments suggest that generative
models need to balance deterministic accuracy, spectral consistency, and
probabilistic calibration, and that stochastic interpolants can potentially
fulfill these requirements by adjusting their sampling. This study establishes
stochastic interpolants as a competitive baseline for physical emulation and
gives insight into the abilities of different generative modeling frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低数据量模仿学习问题，传统方法依赖大规模预训练或高容量架构难以应用，需要提高演示数据的利用效率

Method: NGT方法将模仿学习建模为最优传输问题，通过对抗训练求解，无需预训练或特殊架构，内置不确定性估计

Result: 在复杂连续控制任务（包括高维Humanoid任务）上表现优异，仅需20个状态转移即可有效学习

Conclusion: NGT是一种轻量级、易实现且高效的方法，在极低数据量模仿学习场景下具有显著优势

Abstract: We consider imitation learning in the low-data regime, where only a limited
number of expert demonstrations are available. In this setting, methods that
rely on large-scale pretraining or high-capacity architectures can be difficult
to apply, and efficiency with respect to demonstration data becomes critical.
We introduce Noise-Guided Transport (NGT), a lightweight off-policy method that
casts imitation as an optimal transport problem solved via adversarial
training. NGT requires no pretraining or specialized architectures,
incorporates uncertainty estimation by design, and is easy to implement and
tune. Despite its simplicity, NGT achieves strong performance on challenging
continuous control tasks, including high-dimensional Humanoid tasks, under
ultra-low data regimes with as few as 20 transitions. Code is publicly

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于自动调优框架中超参数调优的新方法，通过统计评估、数据重放等技术，显著降低了调优成本并大幅提升了自动调优器的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动性能调优在科学计算领域广泛应用，但优化算法的超参数几乎从未被调优过，其潜在性能影响未被研究。

Method: 提出通用超参数调优方法，包括跨搜索空间的鲁棒统计评估方法、FAIR数据集发布、以及通过重放历史调优数据的仿真模式。

Result: 即使有限的超参数调优也能将自动调优器性能平均提升94.8%，使用元策略优化超参数可平均提升204.7%。

Conclusion: 超参数调优是推进自动调优研究和实践的强大技术，但常被忽视。

Abstract: Automatic performance tuning (auto-tuning) is widely used to optimize
performance-critical applications across many scientific domains by finding the
best program variant among many choices. Efficient optimization algorithms are
crucial for navigating the vast and complex search spaces in auto-tuning. As is
well known in the context of machine learning and similar fields,
hyperparameters critically shape optimization algorithm efficiency. Yet for
auto-tuning frameworks, these hyperparameters are almost never tuned, and their
potential performance impact has not been studied.
  We present a novel method for general hyperparameter tuning of optimization
algorithms for auto-tuning, thus "tuning the tuner". In particular, we propose
a robust statistical method for evaluating hyperparameter performance across
search spaces, publish a FAIR data set and software for reproducibility, and
present a simulation mode that replays previously recorded tuning data,
lowering the costs of hyperparameter tuning by two orders of magnitude. We show
that even limited hyperparameter tuning can improve auto-tuner performance by
94.8% on average, and establish that the hyperparameters themselves can be
optimized efficiently with meta-strategies (with an average improvement of
204.7%), demonstrating the often overlooked hyperparameter tuning as a powerful
technique for advancing auto-tuning research and practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准解码方法在满足复杂指令和生成事实准确文本方面存在不足，现有控制技术又常常降低输出质量，需要一种更有效的方法来增强LLM的可靠性。

Method: AGD从高概率输出候选词中选择对用户定义感兴趣区域(ROI)归因最高的词，ROI可灵活定义在模型输入或内部组件上。还提出了基于熵的自适应变体，在模型不确定时应用引导。

Result: 在指令遵循方面显著提升成功率(从66.0%到79.1%)；在知识密集型任务中减少幻觉并提高事实准确性；自适应变体减轻了质量下降和计算开销。

Conclusion: AGD是一种多功能、更可解释且有效的方法，能够增强现代LLM的可靠性。

Abstract: The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to follow complex instructions
and generate factually accurate text is critical for their real-world
application. However, standard decoding methods often fail to robustly satisfy
these requirements, while existing control techniques frequently degrade
general output quality. In this work, we introduce Attribution-Guided Decoding
(AGD), an interpretability-based decoding strategy. Instead of directly
manipulating model activations, AGD considers a set of high-probability output
token candidates and selects the one that exhibits the highest attribution to a
user-defined Region of Interest (ROI). This ROI can be flexibly defined over
different parts of the model's input or internal components, allowing AGD to
steer generation towards various desirable behaviors. We demonstrate AGD's
efficacy across three challenging domains. For instruction following, we show
that AGD significantly boosts adherence (e.g., improving the overall success
rate on Llama 3.1 from 66.0% to 79.1%). For knowledge-intensive tasks, we show
that guiding generation towards usage of internal knowledge components or
contextual sources can reduce hallucinations and improve factual accuracy in
both closed-book and open-book settings. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive,
entropy-based variant of AGD that mitigates quality degradation and reduces
computational overhead by applying guidance only when the model is uncertain.
Our work presents a versatile, more interpretable, and effective method for
enhancing the reliability of modern LLMs.

Conclusion: 该工作填补了单问题多尝试启发式优化领域综述的空白，为实践者提供了系统化的策略选择和分类框架。

Abstract: In certain real-world optimization scenarios, practitioners are not
interested in solving multiple problems but rather in finding the best solution
to a single, specific problem. When the computational budget is large relative
to the cost of evaluating a candidate solution, multiple heuristic alternatives
can be tried to solve the same given problem, each possibly with a different
algorithm, parameter configuration, initialization, or stopping criterion. The
sequential selection of which alternative to try next is crucial for
efficiently identifying the one that provides the best possible solution across
multiple attempts. Despite the relevance of this problem in practice, it has
not yet been the exclusive focus of any existing review. Several sequential
alternative selection strategies have been proposed in different research
topics, but they have not been comprehensively and systematically unified under
a common perspective.
  This work presents a focused review of single-problem multi-attempt heuristic
optimization. It brings together suitable strategies to this problem that have
been studied separately through algorithm selection, parameter tuning,
multi-start and resource allocation. These strategies are explained using a
unified terminology within a common framework, which supports the development
of a taxonomy for systematically organizing and classifying them.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反事实解释方法通常需要大量黑盒模型评估，这在模型访问受限时成本高昂且不实用。

Method: ACE算法结合贝叶斯估计和随机优化，通过优先选择信息点来近似决策边界，减少模型评估次数。

Result: 大量实验结果表明，ACE在评估效率上优于现有最先进方法，同时在识别最小可行变化方面保持有效性。

Conclusion: ACE提供了一种样本高效的反事实解释方法，在保持解释质量的同时显著减少了模型查询成本。

Abstract: Counterfactual Explanations (CFEs) interpret machine learning models by
identifying the smallest change to input features needed to change the model's
prediction to a desired output. For classification tasks, CFEs determine how
close a given sample is to the decision boundary of a trained classifier.
Existing methods are often sample-inefficient, requiring numerous evaluations
of a black-box model -- an approach that is both costly and impractical when
access to the model is limited. We propose Adaptive sampling for Counterfactual
Explanations (ACE), a sample-efficient algorithm combining Bayesian estimation
and stochastic optimization to approximate the decision boundary with fewer
queries. By prioritizing informative points, ACE minimizes evaluations while
generating accurate and feasible CFEs. Extensive empirical results show that
ACE achieves superior evaluation efficiency compared to state-of-the-art
methods, while maintaining effectiveness in identifying minimal and actionable
changes.

Motivation: 信息瓶颈(IB)原理为理解神经网络学习提供了理论框架，但其实际应用受到理论模糊性和准确估计挑战的限制。

Method: 基于协同性（特征联合处理获得的信息）重新表述IB原理，使用基于平均交互信息的可计算协同性定义，构建广义信息瓶颈(GIB)框架。

Result: GIB在各种架构（包括ReLU激活函数）中一致展现压缩阶段，在CNN和Transformer中产生可解释的动态，并与对抗鲁棒性理解更一致。

Conclusion: GIB框架在保持与现有IB理论兼容性的同时解决了其局限性，为理解神经网络学习提供了更实用的理论工具。

Abstract: The Information Bottleneck (IB) principle offers a compelling theoretical
framework to understand how neural networks (NNs) learn. However, its practical
utility has been constrained by unresolved theoretical ambiguities and
significant challenges in accurate estimation. In this paper, we present a
\textit{Generalized Information Bottleneck (GIB)} framework that reformulates
the original IB principle through the lens of synergy, i.e., the information
obtainable only through joint processing of features. We provide theoretical
and empirical evidence demonstrating that synergistic functions achieve
superior generalization compared to their non-synergistic counterparts.
Building on these foundations we re-formulate the IB using a computable
definition of synergy based on the average interaction information (II) of each
feature with those remaining. We demonstrate that the original IB objective is
upper bounded by our GIB in the case of perfect estimation, ensuring
compatibility with existing IB theory while addressing its limitations. Our
experimental results demonstrate that GIB consistently exhibits compression
phases across a wide range of architectures (including those with \textit{ReLU}
activations where the standard IB fails), while yielding interpretable dynamics
in both CNNs and Transformers and aligning more closely with our understanding
of adversarial robustness.

Motivation: Muon优化器在神经网络训练中比Adam等自适应方法更快，但直接应用于联邦学习时由于LMO是有偏算子而不收敛，需要解决这一收敛性问题。

Method: 提出了FedMuon方法，通过机制设计缓解LMO的有偏性问题，并分析了近似求解LMO对收敛速度的影响。

Result: 实验表明FedMuon优于最先进的联邦学习方法，且发现任何次数的Newton-Schulz迭代都能保证收敛，但更精确的LMO求解能加速收敛。

Conclusion: FedMuon成功将Muon优化器应用于联邦学习，解决了收敛性问题，并在性能和收敛速度方面表现出优势。

Abstract: Recently, a new optimization method based on the linear minimization oracle
(LMO), called Muon, has been attracting increasing attention since it can train
neural networks faster than existing adaptive optimization methods, such as
Adam. In this paper, we study how Muon can be utilized in federated learning.
We first show that straightforwardly using Muon as the local optimizer of
FedAvg does not converge to the stationary point since the LMO is a biased
operator. We then propose FedMuon which can mitigate this issue. We also
analyze how solving the LMO approximately affects the convergence rate and find
that, surprisingly, FedMuon can converge for any number of Newton-Schulz
iterations, while it can converge faster as we solve the LMO more accurately.
Through experiments, we demonstrated that FedMuon can outperform the
state-of-the-art federated learning methods.

Conclusion: 记忆驱动的自改进框架能够有效结合LLM通用知识与领域特定经验，通过记忆与LLM先验的协同作用显著提升序列决策任务的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as effective action policies for
sequential decision-making (SDM) tasks due to their extensive prior knowledge.
However, this broad yet general knowledge is often insufficient for specific
decision-making tasks with limited task-related data, making it challenging to
efficiently adapt LLMs to specific SDM tasks. To address this challenge, we
propose a memory-driven self-improvement framework that combines LLM general
prior knowledge with a compact memory of domain-specific experiences. Memory
retains past interactions and associated Q-values, thereby capturing
decision-relevant knowledge that facilitates accurate value estimation and
informs the LLM prior refinement. The refined LLM prior, in turn, generates
higher-reward trajectories that further enrich memory, forming a natural
self-improvement framework where memory and LLM prior mutually reinforce each
other. Experiments show that our memory-driven approach significantly
outperforms both traditional RL and LLM-based baselines, e.g., improving
performance by over 40\% on in-distribution tasks and over 75\% when
generalized to unseen tasks in ALFWorld.

Abstract: Research on emergency and mass casualty incident (MCI) triage has been
limited by the absence of openly usable, reproducible benchmarks. Yet these
scenarios demand rapid identification of the patients most in need, where
accurate deterioration prediction can guide timely interventions. While the
MIMIC-IV-ED database is openly available to credentialed researchers,
transforming it into a triage-focused benchmark requires extensive
preprocessing, feature harmonization, and schema alignment -- barriers that
restrict accessibility to only highly technical users.
  We address these gaps by first introducing an open, LLM-assisted emergency
triage benchmark for deterioration prediction (ICU transfer, in-hospital
mortality). The benchmark then defines two regimes: (i) a hospital-rich setting
with vitals, labs, notes, chief complaints, and structured observations, and
(ii) an MCI-like field simulation limited to vitals, observations, and notes.
Large language models (LLMs) contributed directly to dataset construction by
(i) harmonizing noisy fields such as AVPU and breathing devices, (ii)
prioritizing clinically relevant vitals and labs, and (iii) guiding schema
alignment and efficient merging of disparate tables.
  We further provide baseline models and SHAP-based interpretability analyses,
illustrating predictive gaps between regimes and the features most critical for
triage. Together, these contributions make triage prediction research more
reproducible and accessible -- a step toward dataset democratization in
clinical AI.

Abstract: The Schr\"odinger bridge problem is concerned with finding a stochastic
dynamical system bridging two marginal distributions that minimises a certain
transportation cost. This problem, which represents a generalisation of optimal
transport to the stochastic case, has received attention due to its connections
to diffusion models and flow matching, as well as its applications in the
natural sciences. However, all existing algorithms allow to infer such dynamics
only for cases where samples from both distributions are available. In this
paper, we propose the first general method for modelling Schr\"odinger bridges
when one (or both) distributions are given by their unnormalised densities,
with no access to data samples. Our algorithm relies on a generalisation of the
iterative proportional fitting (IPF) procedure to the data-free case, inspired
by recent developments in off-policy reinforcement learning for training of
diffusion samplers. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed data-to-energy
IPF on synthetic problems, finding that it can successfully learn transports
between multimodal distributions. As a secondary consequence of our
reinforcement learning formulation, which assumes a fixed time discretisation
scheme for the dynamics, we find that existing data-to-data Schr\"odinger
bridge algorithms can be substantially improved by learning the diffusion
coefficient of the dynamics. Finally, we apply the newly developed algorithm to
the problem of sampling posterior distributions in latent spaces of generative
models, thus creating a data-free image-to-image translation method. Code:

Conclusion: InVirtuoGen为药物发现建立了一个多功能的生成基础，从早期命中发现到多目标先导化合物优化，并通过开源预训练检查点和代码促进开放科学。

Abstract: We introduce InVirtuoGen, a discrete flow generative model for fragmented
SMILES for de novo and fragment-constrained generation, and
target-property/lead optimization of small molecules. The model learns to
transform a uniform source over all possible tokens into the data distribution.
Unlike masked models, its training loss accounts for predictions on all
sequence positions at every denoising step, shifting the generation paradigm
from completion to refinement, and decoupling the number of sampling steps from
the sequence length. For \textit{de novo} generation, InVirtuoGen achieves a
stronger quality-diversity pareto frontier than prior fragment-based models and
competitive performance on fragment-constrained tasks. For property and lead
optimization, we propose a hybrid scheme that combines a genetic algorithm with
a Proximal Property Optimization fine-tuning strategy adapted to discrete
flows. Our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on the Practical Molecular
Optimization benchmark, measured by top-10 AUC across tasks, and yields higher
docking scores in lead optimization than previous baselines. InVirtuoGen thus
establishes a versatile generative foundation for drug discovery, from early
hit finding to multi-objective lead optimization. We further contribute to open
science by releasing pretrained checkpoints and code, making our results fully
reproducible\footnote{https://github.com/invirtuolabs/InVirtuoGen_results}.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 梯度上升优化方法在机器遗忘任务中经常失败，原因是遗忘集和保留集之间存在统计依赖性，即使只是简单的相关性也会导致这些方法无法有效执行遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示基于梯度上升的无约束优化方法在机器遗忘中的失败现象，挑战了遗忘集和保留集可以独立操作的普遍误解。

Method: 通过经验证据和理论分析，研究梯度上升方法在存在统计依赖性的遗忘任务中的表现，包括逻辑回归案例和神经网络实验。

Result: 发现梯度上升方法不仅无法收敛到理想的重训练模型，反而可能产生比原始模型更差的解，使遗忘过程产生负面影响。

Conclusion: 遗忘集和保留集之间的统计依赖性，即使是简单的相关性，也足以导致基于梯度上升的遗忘方法失败，这对机器遗忘的实际应用提出了重要警示。

Abstract: Contrary to common belief, we show that gradient ascent-based unconstrained
optimization methods frequently fail to perform machine unlearning, a
phenomenon we attribute to the inherent statistical dependence between the
forget and retain data sets. This dependence, which can manifest itself even as
simple correlations, undermines the misconception that these sets can be
independently manipulated during unlearning. We provide empirical and
theoretical evidence showing these methods often fail precisely due to this
overlooked relationship. For random forget sets, this dependence means that
degrading forget set metrics (which, for a retrained model, should mirror test
set metrics) inevitably harms overall test performance. Going beyond random
sets, we consider logistic regression as an instructive example where a
critical failure mode emerges: inter-set dependence causes gradient
descent-ascent iterations to progressively diverge from the ideal retrained
model. Strikingly, these methods can converge to solutions that are not only
far from the retrained ideal but are potentially even further from it than the
original model itself, rendering the unlearning process actively detrimental. A
toy example further illustrates how this dependence can trap models in inferior
local minima, inescapable via finetuning. Our findings highlight that the
presence of such statistical dependencies, even when manifest only as
correlations, can be sufficient for ascent-based unlearning to fail. Our
theoretical insights are corroborated by experiments on complex neural
networks, demonstrating that these methods do not perform as expected in
practice due to this unaddressed statistical interplay.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AC-RL通过强化学习训练视觉模型生成更全面的图像描述，解决视觉数学推理中因信息缺失导致的接口不匹配问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型生成的描述通常省略推理系统所需的精确细节，导致推理失败不是由于推理能力限制，而是缺乏关键视觉信息

Method: 提出自适应澄清强化学习(AC-RL)，通过交互训练视觉模型理解推理者需要的信息，利用澄清请求揭示信息差距，惩罚需要澄清的成功案例

Result: 在七个视觉数学推理基准上，AC-RL比预训练基线平均准确率提高4.4个百分点，分析显示可将澄清请求减少高达39%

Conclusion: AC-RL证明视觉语言接口可以通过纯交互学习有效优化，无需显式标注，澄清请求可作为隐式监督信号

Abstract: Recent text-only models demonstrate remarkable mathematical reasoning
capabilities. Extending these to visual domains requires vision-language models
to translate images into text descriptions. However, current models, trained to
produce captions for human readers, often omit the precise details that
reasoning systems require. This creates an interface mismatch: reasoners often
fail not due to reasoning limitations but because they lack access to critical
visual information. We propose Adaptive-Clarification Reinforcement Learning
(AC-RL), which teaches vision models what information reasoners need through
interaction. Our key insight is that clarification requests during training
reveal information gaps; by penalizing success that requires clarification, we
create pressure for comprehensive initial captions that enable the reasoner to
solve the problem in a single pass. AC-RL improves average accuracy by 4.4
points over pretrained baselines across seven visual mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, and analysis shows it would cut clarification requests by up to 39%
if those were allowed. By treating clarification as a form of implicit
supervision, AC-RL demonstrates that vision-language interfaces can be
effectively learned through interaction alone, without requiring explicit
annotations.

*Guanxi Lu,Hao,Chen,Yuto Karashima,Zhican Wang,Daichi Fujiki,Hongxiang Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了AdaBlock-dLLM，一种无需训练、即插即用的调度器，通过自适应调整块大小来优化扩散式大语言模型的半自回归解码，解决了固定块大小方法的延迟解码开销和过早解码错误问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统半自回归解码采用固定块大小存在两个根本限制：延迟解码开销（高置信度令牌被不必要延迟）和过早解码错误（低置信度令牌过早提交导致错误）。本文旨在挑战固定块大小假设，探索更智能的解码策略。

Method: 通过对去噪过程中置信度动态的统计分析，识别出波动带区域，该区域编码局部语义结构。基于此提出AdaBlock-dLLM调度器，在运行时自适应调整块大小，使块边界与语义步骤对齐。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，AdaBlock-dLLM在相同吞吐量预算下实现了高达5.3%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: 除了推理时优化外，本文的语义感知自适应调度方法和基于置信度的分析有望启发未来dLLMs的训练策略。

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) are gaining attention for their
inherent capacity for parallel decoding, offering a compelling alternative to
autoregressive LLMs. Among various decoding strategies, blockwise
semi-autoregressive (semi-AR) approaches are widely adopted due to their
natural support for KV caching and their favorable accuracy-speed trade-off.
However, this paper identifies two fundamental limitations in the conventional
semi-AR decoding approach that applies a fixed block size: i) late decoding
overhead, where the unmasking of high-confidence tokens outside the current
block is unnecessarily delayed, and ii) premature decoding error, where
low-confidence tokens inside the current block are committed too early, leading
to incorrect tokens. This paper presents the first systematic investigation
challenging the fixed block size assumption in semi-AR decoding. Through a
statistical analysis of confidence dynamics during the denoising process, we
identify a volatility band (VB) region during dLLM decoding, which encodes
local semantic structure and can be used to guide adaptive block sizing.
Leveraging these insights, we introduce AdaBlock-dLLM, a training-free,
plug-and-play scheduler that adaptively aligns block boundaries with semantic
steps by adjusting block size during runtime. Extensive experiments across
diverse benchmarks show that AdaBlock-dLLM achieves up to 5.3% accuracy
improvement under the same throughput budget. Beyond inference-time
optimization, we hope our semantics-aware adaptive scheduling approach and
confidence-based analysis will inspire future training strategies for dLLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs通过纯文本预训练意外地发展了丰富的视觉先验知识，这些先验包含可分离的感知和推理能力，具有不同的扩展趋势和来源。推理先验主要来自代码、数学等推理中心数据，而感知先验则更广泛地来自语料库。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在纯文本预训练中如何发展视觉能力，理解视觉先验的组成和来源，为构建下一代多模态LLMs提供指导。

Method: 通过100多个对照实验（消耗50万GPU小时），全面分析MLLM构建流程，涵盖不同模型规模、数据类别和适应设置，并引入MLE-Bench评估基准。

Result: 发现视觉先验由感知和推理两个可分离部分组成，推理能力主要来自推理中心数据且可迁移，感知能力更依赖视觉编码器和视觉指令调优数据。

Conclusion: 提出了基于数据中心的预训练方法，为从语言预训练中刻意培养视觉先验提供了新途径，推动了下一代多模态LLMs的发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite being trained on text alone,
surprisingly develop rich visual priors. These priors allow latent visual
capabilities to be unlocked for vision tasks with a relatively small amount of
multimodal data, and in some cases, to perform visual tasks without ever having
seen an image. Through systematic analysis, we reveal that visual priors-the
implicit, emergent knowledge about the visual world acquired during language
pre-training-are composed of separable perception and reasoning priors with
unique scaling trends and origins. We show that an LLM's latent visual
reasoning ability is predominantly developed by pre-training on
reasoning-centric data (e.g., code, math, academia) and scales progressively.
This reasoning prior acquired from language pre-training is transferable and
universally applicable to visual reasoning. In contrast, a perception prior
emerges more diffusely from broad corpora, and perception ability is more
sensitive to the vision encoder and visual instruction tuning data. In
parallel, text describing the visual world proves crucial, though its
performance impact saturates rapidly. Leveraging these insights, we propose a
data-centric recipe for pre-training vision-aware LLMs and verify it in 1T
token scale pre-training. Our findings are grounded in over 100 controlled
experiments consuming 500,000 GPU-hours, spanning the full MLLM construction
pipeline-from LLM pre-training to visual alignment and supervised multimodal
fine-tuning-across five model scales, a wide range of data categories and
mixtures, and multiple adaptation setups. Along with our main findings, we
propose and investigate several hypotheses, and introduce the Multi-Level
Existence Bench (MLE-Bench). Together, this work provides a new way of
deliberately cultivating visual priors from language pre-training, paving the
way for the next generation of multimodal LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ACT将决策树方法扩展到非结构化文本数据，通过自然语言问题作为分裂点，结合TextGrad的LLM反馈，在保持透明性和可解释性的同时达到或超越基于提示的方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险应用中，AI系统需要产生透明、可解释和可审计的决策。传统决策树只适用于结构化数据，而LLM虽然能处理非结构化文本，但基于提示的方法缺乏可信赖行为的保证机制。

Method: 提出Agentic分类树(ACT)，将每个分裂点表示为自然语言问题，通过基于不纯度的评估和TextGrad的LLM反馈来优化问题表述。

Result: 在文本基准测试中，ACT在性能上匹配或超越了基于提示的基线方法，同时产生了透明和可解释的决策路径。

Conclusion: ACT成功地将决策树的透明性和可解释性扩展到非结构化文本数据，为高风险应用提供了可信赖的AI决策系统。

Abstract: When used in high-stakes settings, AI systems are expected to produce
decisions that are transparent, interpretable, and auditable, a requirement
increasingly expected by regulations. Decision trees such as CART provide clear
and verifiable rules, but they are restricted to structured tabular data and
cannot operate directly on unstructured inputs such as text. In practice, large
language models (LLMs) are widely used for such data, yet prompting strategies
such as chain-of-thought or prompt optimization still rely on free-form
reasoning, limiting their ability to ensure trustworthy behaviors. We present
the Agentic Classification Tree (ACT), which extends decision-tree methodology
to unstructured inputs by formulating each split as a natural-language
question, refined through impurity-based evaluation and LLM feedback via
TextGrad. Experiments on text benchmarks show that ACT matches or surpasses
prompting-based baselines while producing transparent and interpretable
decision paths.

*Xinyu Liu,Zixuan Xie,Shangtong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 扩展Robbins-Siegmund定理，放宽零阶项的可和性要求，为强化学习算法提供收敛性分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始Robbins-Siegmund定理要求零阶项可和，但在许多重要强化学习应用中无法满足此条件，限制了其适用性。

Method: 引入对随机过程增量的新假设，结合平方可和条件，实现几乎必然收敛到有界集。

Result: 获得了几乎必然收敛速率、高概率集中界和L^p收敛速率，并成功应用于Q-learning线性函数逼近。

Conclusion: 扩展的Robbins-Siegmund定理为强化学习算法提供了更广泛的收敛性分析工具，解决了原始定理的局限性。

Abstract: The Robbins-Siegmund theorem establishes the convergence of stochastic
processes that are almost supermartingales and is foundational for analyzing a
wide range of stochastic iterative algorithms in stochastic approximation and
reinforcement learning (RL). However, its original form has a significant
limitation as it requires the zero-order term to be summable. In many important
RL applications, this summable condition, however, cannot be met. This
limitation motivates us to extend the Robbins-Siegmund theorem for almost
supermartingales where the zero-order term is not summable but only square
summable. Particularly, we introduce a novel and mild assumption on the
increments of the stochastic processes. This together with the square summable
condition enables an almost sure convergence to a bounded set. Additionally, we
further provide almost sure convergence rates, high probability concentration
bounds, and $L^p$ convergence rates. We then apply the new results in
stochastic approximation and RL. Notably, we obtain the first almost sure
convergence rate, the first high probability concentration bound, and the first
$L^p$ convergence rate for $Q$-learning with linear function approximation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了fev-bench基准测试，包含100个时间序列预测任务，涵盖7个领域，其中46个任务包含协变量。配套的fev库支持可重复性评估和现有工作流集成，使用自助法置信区间进行统计严谨的聚合评估。


<details>

Motivation: 现有基准测试存在领域覆盖窄、忽视协变量等现实场景、缺乏统计严谨性、难以集成到现有流程等问题，阻碍了时间序列预测领域的持续进步。

Method: 开发fev-bench基准测试（100个任务，7个领域，46个含协变量任务）和fev轻量级Python库，采用自助法置信区间进行统计严谨的聚合评估，从胜率和技能得分两个维度评估模型性能。

Result: 报告了各种预训练模型、统计模型和基线模型在fev-bench上的结果，识别了有前景的未来研究方向。

Conclusion: fev-bench解决了现有基准测试的局限性，为时间序列预测提供了更全面、统计严谨且易于集成的评估框架。

Abstract: Benchmark quality is critical for meaningful evaluation and sustained
progress in time series forecasting, particularly given the recent rise of
pretrained models. Existing benchmarks often have narrow domain coverage or
overlook important real-world settings, such as tasks with covariates.
Additionally, their aggregation procedures often lack statistical rigor, making
it unclear whether observed performance differences reflect true improvements
or random variation. Many benchmarks also fail to provide infrastructure for
consistent evaluation or are too rigid to integrate into existing pipelines. To
address these gaps, we propose fev-bench, a benchmark comprising 100
forecasting tasks across seven domains, including 46 tasks with covariates.
Supporting the benchmark, we introduce fev, a lightweight Python library for
benchmarking forecasting models that emphasizes reproducibility and seamless
integration with existing workflows. Usingfev, fev-bench employs principled
aggregation methods with bootstrapped confidence intervals to report model
performance along two complementary dimensions: win rates and skill scores. We
report results on fev-bench for various pretrained, statistical and baseline
models, and identify promising directions for future research.

*Mohammad Hassan Vali,Tom Bäckström,Arno Solin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiVeQ和SF-DiVeQ是两种新的向量量化方法，通过将量化视为添加模拟量化失真的误差向量，保持前向传播的硬分配同时允许梯度流动，解决了传统向量量化中硬分配阻碍端到端训练的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统向量量化在深度模型中很常见，但其硬分配会阻断梯度并阻碍端到端训练。需要一种既能保持前向传播的硬分配特性，又能让梯度流动的方法。

Method: DiVeQ将量化视为添加模拟量化失真的误差向量；SF-DiVeQ是其空间填充变体，通过将向量分配到连接码字的曲线来减少量化误差并充分利用码本。两种方法都不需要辅助损失或温度调度。

Result: 在VQ-VAE压缩和VQGAN生成任务中，跨多个数据集测试，这些方法在重建和样本质量方面优于其他量化方法。

Conclusion: DiVeQ和SF-DiVeQ提供了有效的向量量化解决方案，能够实现端到端训练，同时提高重建和生成质量。

Abstract: Vector quantization is common in deep models, yet its hard assignments block
gradients and hinder end-to-end training. We propose DiVeQ, which treats
quantization as adding an error vector that mimics the quantization distortion,
keeping the forward pass hard while letting gradients flow. We also present a
space-filling variant (SF-DiVeQ) that assigns to a curve constructed by the
lines connecting codewords, resulting in less quantization error and full
codebook usage. Both methods train end-to-end without requiring auxiliary
losses or temperature schedules. On VQ-VAE compression and VQGAN generation
across various data sets, they improve reconstruction and sample quality over
alternative quantization approaches.

Motivation: 等变神经网络在分子和几何数据学习中具有强归纳偏置，但通常依赖专门且计算昂贵的张量操作，需要更高效的实现方法。

Method: 开发框架将现有张量场网络转换为局部规范化范式，系统比较不同等变表示的理论复杂度、经验运行时间和预测准确性。

Conclusion: 局部规范化框架为等变神经网络提供了高效实用的实现方案，使等变性能够轻松集成到标准神经网络架构中。

Abstract: Equivariant neural networks offer strong inductive biases for learning from
molecular and geometric data but often rely on specialized, computationally
expensive tensor operations. We present a framework to transfers existing
tensor field networks into the more efficient local canonicalization paradigm,
preserving equivariance while significantly improving the runtime. Within this
framework, we systematically compare different equivariant representations in
terms of theoretical complexity, empirical runtime, and predictive accuracy. We
publish the tensor_frames package, a PyTorchGeometric based implementation for
local canonicalization, that enables straightforward integration of
equivariance into any standard message passing neural network.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出EAT（Entropy After </Think>）方法，通过监控推理过程中停止思考标记后的熵值变化来检测和防止大语言模型的过度思考问题，实现自适应计算分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在长链推理中会出现过度思考现象，即使已经得出正确答案仍继续推理，造成计算资源浪费。需要一种简单有效的方法来检测和提前终止推理。

Method: 在推理过程中添加停止思考标记</think>，监控后续token的熵值轨迹，当熵值下降并稳定时（Pass@1达到平台期），通过指数移动平均的方差阈值实现提前停止。

Result: 在MATH500和AIME2025数据集上，EAT方法减少13-21%的token使用量而不影响准确率，在黑盒设置下同样有效。

Conclusion: EAT提供了一种简单且廉价的方法来检测过度思考，实现自适应计算分配，提高推理效率。

Abstract: Large reasoning models show improved performance with longer chains of
thought. However, recent work has highlighted (qualitatively) their tendency to
overthink, continuing to revise answers even after reaching the correct
solution. We quantitatively confirm this inefficiency by tracking Pass@1 for
answers averaged over a large number of rollouts and find that the model often
begins to always produce the correct answer early in the reasoning, making
extra reasoning a waste of tokens. To detect and prevent overthinking, we
propose a simple and inexpensive novel signal -- Entropy After </Think> (EAT)
-- for monitoring and deciding whether to exit reasoning early. By appending a
stop thinking token (</think>) and monitoring the entropy of the following
token as the model reasons, we obtain a trajectory that decreases and
stabilizes when Pass@1 plateaus; thresholding its variance under an exponential
moving average yields a practical stopping rule. Importantly, our approach
enables adaptively allocating compute based on the EAT trajectory, allowing us
to spend compute in a more efficient way compared with fixing the token budget
for all questions. Empirically, on MATH500 and AIME2025, EAT reduces token
usage by 13 - 21% without harming accuracy, and it remains effective in black
box settings where logits from the reasoning model are not accessible, and EAT
is computed with proxy models.

TL;DR: 提出了TAP（两阶段自适应个性化）方法，通过客户端-服务器模型架构不匹配和知识蒸馏来解决多任务多模态联邦学习中的个性化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习产生的最终模型不一定适合每个客户端的需求，特别是在数据、任务和模态都存在异构性的场景下，现有方法对基础模型的个性化微调关注不足。

Method: TAP方法包含两个阶段：(i) 利用客户端与服务器模型架构不匹配，在有益于客户端本地任务时选择性进行替换操作；(ii) 在联邦学习后进行知识蒸馏，在不损害个性化的情况下获取有益通用知识。

Result: 通过大量实验验证了所提算法在各种数据集和任务上的有效性，优于多个基线方法。

Conclusion: TAP方法能够有效解决多任务多模态联邦学习中的个性化问题，随着模态-任务对数量的增加，服务器模型服务所有任务的能力会受到影响。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL), despite demonstrating impressive capabilities in the
training of multiple models in a decentralized manner, has been shown to
produce a final model not necessarily well-suited to the needs of each client.
While extensive work has been conducted on how to create tailored personalized
models, called Personalized Federated Learning (PFL), less attention has been
given to personalization via fine-tuning of foundation models with multi-task
and multi-modal properties. Moreover, there exists a lack of understanding in
the literature on how to fine-tune and personalize such models in a setting
that is heterogeneous across clients not only in data, but also in tasks and
modalities. To address this gap in the literature, we propose TAP (Two-Stage
Adaptive Personalization), which (i) leverages mismatched model architectures
between the clients and server to selectively conduct replacement operations
when it benefits a client's local tasks and (ii) engages in post-FL knowledge
distillation for capturing beneficial general knowledge without compromising
personalization. We also introduce the first convergence analysis of the server
model under its modality-task pair architecture, and demonstrate that as the
number of modality-task pairs increases, its ability to cater to all tasks
suffers. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed algorithm across a variety of datasets and tasks in comparison to a
multitude of baselines. Implementation code is publicly available at
https://github.com/lee3296/TAP.

Conclusion: MPA是检测电力系统不稳定性攻击的可行方法，能够为现有负荷削减决策系统提供防御能力，增强电力基础设施的安全性。

Abstract: Every year critical infrastructure becomes more complex and we grow to rely
on it more and more. With this reliance, it becomes an attractive target for
cyberattacks from sophisticated actors, with one of the most attractive targets
being the power grid. One class of attacks, instability attacks, is a newer
type of attack that has relatively few protections developed. We present a cost
effective, data-driven approach to training a supervised machine learning model
to retrofit load shedding decision systems in power grids with the capacity to
defend against instability attacks. We show a proof of concept on the IEEE 14
Bus System using the Achilles Heel Technologies Power Grid Analyzer, and show
through an implementation of modified Prony analysis (MPA) that MPA is a viable
method for detecting instability attacks and triggering defense mechanisms.

Motivation: 开发一种能够揭示神经网络如何感知数据相似性的可解释性工具，帮助理解模型内部的数据表示结构。

Method: 通过计算在低损失保持的参数扰动分布下的每样本损失协方差矩阵来构建损失核，该方法在合成多任务问题和Inception-v1模型上进行了验证。

Result: 在合成多任务问题上成功分离了不同任务的输入；在ImageNet上，损失核的结构与WordNet语义层次结构对齐，表明其能够捕捉语义相似性。

Conclusion: 损失核是一种实用的可解释性和数据归因工具，能够有效揭示神经网络对数据相似性的内部表示。

Abstract: We introduce the loss kernel, an interpretability method for measuring
similarity between data points according to a trained neural network. The
kernel is the covariance matrix of per-sample losses computed under a
distribution of low-loss-preserving parameter perturbations. We first validate
our method on a synthetic multitask problem, showing it separates inputs by
task as predicted by theory. We then apply this kernel to Inception-v1 to
visualize the structure of ImageNet, and we show that the kernel's structure
aligns with the WordNet semantic hierarchy. This establishes the loss kernel as
a practical tool for interpretability and data attribution.

TL;DR: 提出TASP方法，通过拓扑分解和原语分解充分利用现代加速器的通信能力，相比Ring Attention在长上下文LLM中实现了最高3.58倍的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流序列并行方法Ring Attention由于采用Ring AllGather通信原语与现代加速器的AlltoAll拓扑不匹配，导致通信效率低下，限制了实际应用。

Method: 基于哈密顿分解理论，将现代加速器拓扑分解为多个正交环数据路径，并将Ring AllGather原语分解为相同数量的并发环数据传输，提出拓扑感知的序列并行方法TASP。

Result: 在单节点和多节点NVIDIA H100系统以及单节点AMD MI300X系统上的实验表明，TASP比Ring Attention及其变体Zigzag-Ring Attention实现了更高的通信效率，最高可达3.58倍加速。

Conclusion: TASP通过充分利用现代加速器的通信能力，有效解决了长上下文LLM中序列并行的通信效率问题，为大规模语言模型训练提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Long-context large language models (LLMs) face constraints due to the
quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism. The mainstream sequence
parallelism (SP) method, Ring Attention, attempts to solve this by distributing
the query into multiple query chunks across accelerators and enable each Q
tensor to access all KV tensors from other accelerators via the Ring AllGather
communication primitive. However, it exhibits low communication efficiency,
restricting its practical applicability. This inefficiency stems from the
mismatch between the Ring AllGather communication primitive it adopts and the
AlltoAll topology of modern accelerators. A Ring AllGather primitive is
composed of iterations of ring-styled data transfer, which can only utilize a
very limited fraction of an AlltoAll topology.
  Inspired by the Hamiltonian decomposition of complete directed graphs, we
identify that modern accelerator topology can be decomposed into multiple
orthogonal ring datapaths which can concurrently transfer data without
interference. Based on this, we further observe that the Ring AllGather
primitive can also be decomposed into the same number of concurrent ring-styled
data transfer at every iteration. Based on these insights, we propose TASP, a
topology-aware SP method for long-context LLMs that fully utilizes the
communication capacity of modern accelerators via topology decomposition and
primitive decomposition. Experimental results on both single-node and
multi-node NVIDIA H100 systems and a single-node AMD MI300X system demonstrate
that TASP achieves higher communication efficiency than Ring Attention on these
modern accelerator topologies and achieves up to 3.58 speedup than Ring
Attention and its variant Zigzag-Ring Attention. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统影响函数在深度神经网络中面临Hessian矩阵不可逆和高维参数空间的挑战，需要新的方法来有效评估参数影响。

Method: 使用随机梯度MCMC采样估计损失景观统计，替代Hessian逆矩阵计算，捕捉参数间的高阶交互，实现Hessian-free方法。

Result: 在预测重训练实验方面取得了最先进的结果，能够高效扩展到数十亿参数的神经网络。

Conclusion: 局部贝叶斯影响函数为深度神经网络提供了一种可扩展的影响分析工具，克服了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Classical influence functions face significant challenges when applied to
deep neural networks, primarily due to non-invertible Hessians and
high-dimensional parameter spaces. We propose the local Bayesian influence
function (BIF), an extension of classical influence functions that replaces
Hessian inversion with loss landscape statistics that can be estimated via
stochastic-gradient MCMC sampling. This Hessian-free approach captures
higher-order interactions among parameters and scales efficiently to neural
networks with billions of parameters. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results
on predicting retraining experiments.

Abstract: We introduce Panama, an active learning framework to train parametric guitar
amp models end-to-end using a combination of an LSTM model and a WaveNet-like

that are determined through an ensemble-based active learning strategy to
minimize the amount of datapoints needed (i.e., amp knob settings). Our
strategy uses gradient-based optimization to maximize the disagreement among

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个有限元框架来生成合成性胸主动脉瘤，并训练神经网络从空间扩张和扩张性图谱中预测初始损伤组合。研究发现UNet模型在所有数据格式中表现最佳，且同时使用扩张和扩张性数据比仅使用几何数据显著提高预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胸主动脉瘤由多种机械和机械生物学损伤引起，不同损伤会创造不同的机械脆弱性。需要识别驱动疾病进展的相互作用因素，以支持个性化治疗策略的开发。

Method: 使用有限元框架生成数百种异质性损伤的合成胸主动脉瘤，构建局部扩张和扩张性的空间图谱来训练神经网络预测初始损伤组合。比较了Deep Operator Networks、UNets和Laplace Neural Operators等多种架构。

Result: 所有网络中，仅使用扩张数据训练时的预测误差显著更高，表明扩张性信息的附加价值。在所有测试模型中，UNet在所有数据格式中始终提供最高准确度。

Conclusion: 在胸主动脉瘤评估中获取扩张和扩张性的全场测量对于揭示疾病的机械生物学驱动因素至关重要，支持个性化治疗策略的发展。

Abstract: Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) arise from diverse mechanical and
mechanobiological disruptions to the aortic wall that increase the risk of
dissection or rupture. Evidence links TAA development to dysfunctions in the
aortic mechanotransduction axis, including loss of elastic fiber integrity and
cell-matrix connections. Because distinct insults create different mechanical
vulnerabilities, there is a critical need to identify interacting factors that
drive progression. Here, we use a finite element framework to generate
synthetic TAAs from hundreds of heterogeneous insults spanning varying degrees
of elastic fiber damage and impaired mechanosensing. From these simulations, we
construct spatial maps of localized dilatation and distensibility to train
neural networks that predict the initiating combined insult. We compare several
architectures (Deep Operator Networks, UNets, and Laplace Neural Operators) and
multiple input data formats to define a standard for future subject-specific
modeling. We also quantify predictive performance when networks are trained
using only geometric data (dilatation) versus both geometric and mechanical
data (dilatation plus distensibility). Across all networks, prediction errors
are significantly higher when trained on dilatation alone, underscoring the
added value of distensibility information. Among the tested models, UNet
consistently provides the highest accuracy across all data formats. These
findings highlight the importance of acquiring full-field measurements of both
dilatation and distensibility in TAA assessment to reveal the mechanobiological
drivers of disease and support the development of personalized treatment
strategies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出条件奖励建模(CRM)方法，通过将LLM推理建模为导致正确答案的时间过程，解决现有过程奖励模型在捕捉步骤间依赖性和对齐过程奖励与最终结果方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有过程奖励模型要么孤立处理每个推理步骤，无法捕捉步骤间依赖关系，要么难以将过程奖励与最终结果对齐，导致奖励信号不尊重时序因果关系，面临信用分配模糊问题。

Method: CRM将LLM推理建模为时间过程，每个推理步骤的奖励不仅基于前序步骤，还明确与推理轨迹的最终结果相关联。通过强制执行条件概率规则，捕捉推理步骤间的因果关系。

Result: 在Best-of-N采样、束搜索和强化学习等实验中，CRM始终优于现有奖励模型，对奖励攻击更鲁棒，且在不依赖基于真实值的可验证奖励情况下提供稳定的下游改进。

Conclusion: CRM为增强LLM推理提供了一个原则性框架，通过条件概率建模解决了信用分配模糊问题，实现了更可靠的跨样本比较。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising approach to enhance
the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by guiding their
step-by-step reasoning toward a final answer. However, existing PRMs either
treat each reasoning step in isolation, failing to capture inter-step
dependencies, or struggle to align process rewards with the final outcome.
Consequently, the reward signal fails to respect temporal causality in
sequential reasoning and faces ambiguous credit assignment. These limitations
make downstream models vulnerable to reward hacking and lead to suboptimal
performance. In this work, we propose Conditional Reward Modeling (CRM) that
frames LLM reasoning as a temporal process leading to a correct answer. The
reward of each reasoning step is not only conditioned on the preceding steps
but also explicitly linked to the final outcome of the reasoning trajectory. By
enforcing conditional probability rules, our design captures the causal
relationships among reasoning steps, with the link to the outcome allowing
precise attribution of each intermediate step, thereby resolving credit
assignment ambiguity. Further, through this consistent probabilistic modeling,
the rewards produced by CRM enable more reliable cross-sample comparison.
Experiments across Best-of-N sampling, beam search and reinforcement learning
demonstrate that CRM consistently outperforms existing reward models, offering
a principled framework for enhancing LLM reasoning. In particular, CRM is more
robust to reward hacking and delivers stable downstream improvements without
relying on verifiable rewards derived from ground truth.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习预测的不确定性量化对于安全关键应用中的可靠决策至关重要，但现有进展主要集中在分类任务，回归任务的不确定性量化仍具挑战性。

Method: 基于CRPS、对数、平方误差和二次评分等适当评分规则构建统一框架，在参数假设下推导闭式不确定性度量表达式，使用模型集成进行估计。

Result: 推导的不确定性度量自然分解为偶然不确定性和认知不确定性，恢复了基于预测方差和微分熵的流行回归UQ度量。在合成和真实数据集上的广泛评估为选择可靠UQ度量提供了指导。

Conclusion: 该框架为回归任务提供了统一的不确定性量化方法，能够有效分解不同类型的不确定性，并为实际应用中的UQ度量选择提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty of machine learning model predictions is essential
for reliable decision-making, especially in safety-critical applications.
Recently, uncertainty quantification (UQ) theory has advanced significantly,
building on a firm basis of learning with proper scoring rules. However, these
advances were focused on classification, while extending these ideas to
regression remains challenging. In this work, we introduce a unified UQ
framework for regression based on proper scoring rules, such as CRPS,
logarithmic, squared error, and quadratic scores. We derive closed-form
expressions for the resulting uncertainty measures under practical parametric
assumptions and show how to estimate them using ensembles of models. In
particular, the derived uncertainty measures naturally decompose into aleatoric
and epistemic components. The framework recovers popular regression UQ measures
based on predictive variance and differential entropy. Our broad evaluation on
synthetic and real-world regression datasets provides guidance for selecting
reliable UQ measures.

Motivation: 现有的测试时扩展方法要么采用并行推理（选择多个独立解），要么采用顺序推理（自我精炼），但都有局限性。需要结合两者的优势来更有效地利用推理计算资源。

Method: RSA方法在每一步中通过聚合推理链子集来精化候选解群体，利用推理链中的丰富信息（不仅是最终答案），从不同思维链中的部分正确中间步骤进行引导。

Result: RSA在不同任务、模型家族和规模上都带来了显著的性能提升，特别是让Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507模型能够与更大的推理模型竞争，在多个基准测试中优于纯并行和顺序扩展策略。

Conclusion: RSA是一种有效的测试时扩展方法，通过结合并行和顺序推理的优势，能够显著提升模型性能。通过聚合感知的强化学习方法训练模型进一步带来了性能增益。

Abstract: Test-time scaling methods improve the capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) by increasing the amount of compute used during inference to make a
prediction. Inference-time compute can be scaled in parallel by choosing among
multiple independent solutions or sequentially through self-refinement. We
propose Recursive Self-Aggregation (RSA), a test-time scaling method inspired
by evolutionary methods that combines the benefits of both parallel and
sequential scaling. Each step of RSA refines a population of candidate
reasoning chains through aggregation of subsets to yield a population of
improved solutions, which are then used as the candidate pool for the next
iteration. RSA exploits the rich information embedded in the reasoning chains
-- not just the final answers -- and enables bootstrapping from partially
correct intermediate steps within different chains of thought. Empirically, RSA
delivers substantial performance gains with increasing compute budgets across
diverse tasks, model families and sizes. Notably, RSA enables
Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 to achieve competitive performance with larger reasoning
models, including DeepSeek-R1 and o3-mini (high), while outperforming purely
parallel and sequential scaling strategies across AIME-25, HMMT-25, Reasoning
Gym, LiveCodeBench-v6, and SuperGPQA. We further demonstrate that training the
model to combine solutions via a novel aggregation-aware reinforcement learning
approach yields significant performance gains. Code available at

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable success in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Process-Supervised RL
(PSRL) has emerged as a more effective paradigm compared to outcome-based RL.
However, existing PSRL approaches suffer from limited exploration efficiency,
both in terms of branching positions and sampling. In this paper, we introduce
a novel PSRL framework (AttnRL), which enables efficient exploration for
reasoning models. Motivated by preliminary observations that steps exhibiting
high attention scores correlate with reasoning behaviors, we propose to branch
from positions with high values. Furthermore, we develop an adaptive sampling
strategy that accounts for problem difficulty and historical batch size,
ensuring that the whole training batch maintains non-zero advantage values. To
further improve sampling efficiency, we design a one-step off-policy training
pipeline for PSRL. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging mathematical
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior
approaches in terms of performance and sampling and training efficiency.

Motivation: 多模态模型的快速发展需要能够严格评估在安全关键、动态真实世界环境中理解和推理能力的基准测试。现有基准在覆盖事故场景和超越领域（空中、水域）的安全关键设置方面存在不足。

Method: 构建包含车辆事故场景和空中、水域安全关键场景的大规模基准，涵盖不同视频长度（短/中/长）和难度级别（简单/中等/困难），系统性地测试时间、空间和意图理解推理能力。

Result: 对最先进模型（如Gemini-2.5 Pro和GPT-5）的评估显示，即使在最困难任务和最长视频上，最强模型准确率仅约18%，揭示了在真实世界时空和意图推理方面的重大差距。

Conclusion: AccidentBench旨在暴露多模态模型在安全关键场景中的关键能力差距，推动开发更安全、更鲁棒且更符合真实世界安全挑战的模型。

Abstract: Rapid advances in multimodal models demand benchmarks that rigorously
evaluate understanding and reasoning in safety-critical, dynamic real-world
settings. We present AccidentBench, a large-scale benchmark that combines
vehicle accident scenarios with Beyond domains, safety-critical settings in air
and water that emphasize spatial and temporal reasoning (e.g., navigation,
orientation, multi-vehicle motion). The benchmark contains approximately 2000
videos and over 19000 human-annotated question--answer pairs spanning multiple
video lengths (short/medium/long) and difficulty levels (easy/medium/hard).
Tasks systematically probe core capabilities: temporal, spatial, and intent
understanding and reasoning. By unifying accident-centric traffic scenes with
broader safety-critical scenarios in air and water, AccidentBench offers a
comprehensive, physically grounded testbed for evaluating models under
real-world variability. Evaluations of state-of-the-art models (e.g.,
Gemini-2.5 Pro and GPT-5) show that even the strongest models achieve only
about 18% accuracy on the hardest tasks and longest videos, revealing
substantial gaps in real-world temporal, spatial, and intent reasoning.
AccidentBench is designed to expose these critical gaps and drive the
development of multimodal models that are safer, more robust, and better
aligned with real-world safety-critical challenges. The code and dataset are

Motivation: 由于AI对数据扰动和对抗样本的敏感性，需要在部署前进行鲁棒性评估，但传统方法需要访问训练和测试数据集，可能危及数据隐私和机密性。

Conclusion: SPATA有助于提高处理机密数据或关键基础设施的组织的透明度，促进更可信的AI发展。

Abstract: Due to the susceptibility of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to data
perturbations and adversarial examples, it is crucial to perform a thorough
robustness evaluation before any Machine Learning (ML) model is deployed.
However, examining a model's decision boundaries and identifying potential
vulnerabilities typically requires access to the training and testing datasets,
which may pose risks to data privacy and confidentiality. To improve
transparency in organizations that handle confidential data or manage critical
infrastructure, it is essential to allow external verification and validation
of AI without the disclosure of private datasets. This paper presents
Systematic Pattern Analysis (SPATA), a deterministic method that converts any
tabular dataset to a domain-independent representation of its statistical
patterns, to provide more detailed and transparent data cards. SPATA computes
the projection of each data instance into a discrete space where they can be
analyzed and compared, without risking data leakage. These projected datasets
can be reliably used for the evaluation of how different features affect ML
model robustness and for the generation of interpretable explanations of their
behavior, contributing to more trustworthy AI.

Motivation: 现代多模态模型虽然能够处理照片输入，但在空间重建任务中需要真正的空间智能，包括推断房间布局、理解连通性和保持比例一致性。该研究旨在量化评估不同AI架构的空间推理能力。

Method: 使用50套公寓（每套约20张室内照片）的数据集，评估领先的语言模型、图像生成模型和代理系统。评分算法基于房间连通图和大小的相似性来比较生成平面图与真实平面图。

Result: 大多数模型表现接近随机基线水平，人类表现显著优于AI。图像生成模型在指令遵循方面特别困难，基于代理的迭代优化方法相比单次生成没有明显改进。

Conclusion: Blueprint-Bench为比较不同模型架构的空间智能提供了首个数值框架，揭示了当前AI在空间推理方面的重大局限性，需要持续监控通用AI系统中空间智能的发展。

Abstract: We introduce Blueprint-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate spatial
reasoning capabilities in AI models through the task of converting apartment
photographs into accurate 2D floor plans. While the input modality
(photographs) is well within the training distribution of modern multimodal
models, the task of spatial reconstruction requires genuine spatial
intelligence: inferring room layouts, understanding connectivity, and
maintaining consistent scale. We evaluate leading language models (GPT-5,
Claude 4 Opus, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok-4), image generation models (GPT-Image,
NanoBanana), and agent systems (Codex CLI, Claude Code) on a dataset of 50
apartments with approximately 20 interior images each. Our scoring algorithm
measures similarity between generated and ground-truth floor plans based on
room connectivity graphs and size rankings. Results reveal a significant blind
spot in current AI capabilities: most models perform at or below a random
baseline, while human performance remains substantially superior. Image
generation models particularly struggle with instruction following, while
agent-based approaches with iterative refinement capabilities show no
meaningful improvement over single-pass generation. Blueprint-Bench provides
the first numerical framework for comparing spatial intelligence across
different model architectures. We will continue evaluating new models as they
are released and welcome community submissions, monitoring for the emergence of
spatial intelligence in generalist AI systems.

Abstract: Causal artificial intelligence aims to enhance explainability,
trustworthiness, and robustness in AI by leveraging structural causal models
(SCMs). In this pursuit, recent advances formalize network sheaves of causal
knowledge. Pushing in the same direction, we introduce the causal abstraction
network (CAN), a specific instance of such sheaves where (i) SCMs are Gaussian,
(ii) restriction maps are transposes of constructive linear causal abstractions
(CAs), and (iii) edge stalks correspond -- up to rotation -- to the node stalks
of more detailed SCMs. We investigate the theoretical properties of CAN,
including algebraic invariants, cohomology, consistency, global sections
characterized via the Laplacian kernel, and smoothness. We then tackle the
learning of consistent CANs. Our problem formulation separates into
edge-specific local Riemannian problems and avoids nonconvex, costly
objectives. We propose an efficient search procedure as a solution, solving the
local problems with SPECTRAL, our iterative method with closed-form updates and
suitable for positive definite and semidefinite covariance matrices.
Experiments on synthetic data show competitive performance in the CA learning
task, and successful recovery of diverse CAN structures.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型安全评估方法存在评估者偏见和模型同质性导致的检测失败问题，影响了风险评估的鲁棒性。

Method: 将潜在风险概念空间分解为显性风险、隐性风险和非风险三个互斥子空间，提出RADAR多智能体协作框架，通过四个专业互补角色和动态更新机制实现风险概念分布的自进化。

Result: 在包含800个挑战性案例的测试集上，RADAR在准确性、稳定性和自评估风险敏感性等多个维度显著优于基线方法，风险识别准确率比最强基线方法提升28.87%。

Conclusion: RADAR框架通过重构风险概念空间和多智能体协作机制，能够全面覆盖显性和隐性风险，有效缓解评估者偏见，为大语言模型安全评估提供了新的范式。

Abstract: Existing safety evaluation methods for large language models (LLMs) suffer
from inherent limitations, including evaluator bias and detection failures
arising from model homogeneity, which collectively undermine the robustness of
risk evaluation processes. This paper seeks to re-examine the risk evaluation
paradigm by introducing a theoretical framework that reconstructs the
underlying risk concept space. Specifically, we decompose the latent risk
concept space into three mutually exclusive subspaces: the explicit risk
subspace (encompassing direct violations of safety guidelines), the implicit
risk subspace (capturing potential malicious content that requires contextual
reasoning for identification), and the non-risk subspace. Furthermore, we
propose RADAR, a multi-agent collaborative evaluation framework that leverages
multi-round debate mechanisms through four specialized complementary roles and
employs dynamic update mechanisms to achieve self-evolution of risk concept
distributions. This approach enables comprehensive coverage of both explicit
and implicit risks while mitigating evaluator bias. To validate the
effectiveness of our framework, we construct an evaluation dataset comprising
800 challenging cases. Extensive experiments on our challenging testset and
public benchmarks demonstrate that RADAR significantly outperforms baseline
evaluation methods across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, stability,
and self-evaluation risk sensitivity. Notably, RADAR achieves a 28.87%
improvement in risk identification accuracy compared to the strongest baseline
evaluation method.

TL;DR: 本文比较了Chain-of-Thought（CoT）和Latent Thought两种推理方法，发现Latent Thought在循环Transformer中支持并行计算，比CoT的顺序处理更高效，而CoT则通过随机解码处理精确计算不可行的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然CoT和Latent Thought都利用迭代计算，但它们在连续潜在空间和离散语言表示中的能力比较尚未充分探索，需要系统分析两种方法的相对优势和适用场景。

Method: 对循环Transformer中的Latent Thought进行形式化分析，比较其与CoT在计算效率和问题解决能力方面的差异。

Result: Latent Thought支持并行计算，计算效率更高；CoT通过随机解码能够逼近精确计算不可行的问题的解。

Conclusion: 两种方法各有优势：Latent Thought适合需要深度驱动递归的任务，CoT适合处理精确计算不可行的问题，这为选择推理范式提供了实践指导。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) elicits reasoning in large language models by
explicitly generating intermediate steps in natural language. In contrast,
Latent Thought in looped models operates directly in the continuous latent
space, enabling computation beyond discrete linguistic representations. While
both approaches exploit iterative computation, their comparative capabilities
remain underexplored. In this work, we present a formal analysis showing that
Latent Thought in Looped Transformers enables parallel computation, which is
more efficient than the inherently sequential process of CoT. In contrast, CoT
leverages stochastic decoding to approximate solutions to problems where exact
computation is intractable. These separations suggest the tasks for which
depth-driven recursion is more suitable, thereby offering practical guidance
for choosing between reasoning paradigms. Code is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了ID-RAG机制，通过构建动态结构化身份模型（知识图谱）来解决生成代理在长期任务中的身份漂移问题，在市长选举模拟中显著提升了身份一致性和收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型驱动的生成代理被部署用于长期任务，当长期记忆上下文随时间增长时，它们难以保持一致性，导致身份漂移、忽略既定信念和在多代理系统中传播幻觉等关键故障。

Method: 引入身份检索增强生成（ID-RAG）机制，将代理的角色和持久偏好锚定在动态结构化的身份模型中：一个包含核心信念、特质和价值观的知识图谱。在代理决策循环中查询该模型以检索相关身份上下文，直接指导行动选择。

Result: 在市长选举的社会模拟中，使用ID-RAG的HAis代理在长期角色一致性方面优于基线代理——在第四个时间步所有测试模型中实现了更高的身份召回率，并将模拟收敛时间减少了19%（GPT-4o）和58%（GPT-4o mini）。

Conclusion: 通过将身份视为明确、可检索的知识结构，ID-RAG为开发更具时间一致性、可解释性和对齐性的生成代理提供了基础性方法。

Abstract: Generative agents powered by language models are increasingly deployed for
long-horizon tasks. However, as long-term memory context grows over time, they
struggle to maintain coherence. This deficiency leads to critical failures,
including identity drift, ignoring established beliefs, and the propagation of
hallucinations in multi-agent systems. To mitigate these challenges, this paper
introduces Identity Retrieval-Augmented Generation (ID-RAG), a novel mechanism
designed to ground an agent's persona and persistent preferences in a dynamic,
structured identity model: a knowledge graph of core beliefs, traits, and
values. During the agent's decision loop, this model is queried to retrieve
relevant identity context, which directly informs action selection. We
demonstrate this approach by introducing and implementing a new class of ID-RAG
enabled agents called Human-AI Agents (HAis), where the identity model is
inspired by the Chronicle structure used in Perspective-Aware AI, a dynamic
knowledge graph learned from a real-world entity's digital footprint. In social
simulations of a mayoral election, HAis using ID-RAG outperformed baseline
agents in long-horizon persona coherence - achieving higher identity recall
across all tested models by the fourth timestep - and reduced simulation
convergence time by 19% (GPT-4o) and 58% (GPT-4o mini). By treating identity as
an explicit, retrievable knowledge structure, ID-RAG offers a foundational
approach for developing more temporally coherent, interpretable, and aligned
generative agents. Our code is open-source and available at:

TL;DR: CIMNAS是一个针对存内计算(CIM)神经网络的联合优化框架，同时搜索软件参数、量化策略和硬件参数，实现了显著的能效提升而不损失精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了最大化存内计算(CIM)神经网络的硬件效率和性能精度，需要同时优化软件和硬件设计参数，但手动调优因参数数量庞大且相互依赖复杂而不切实际。

Method: 提出CIMNAS框架，在9.9x10^85参数组合的搜索空间中同时搜索软件参数、量化策略和硬件参数，涵盖器件级、电路级和架构级协同优化。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上，CIMNAS相比基线实现了90.1x-104.5x的EDAP降低，4.68x-4.82x的TOPS/W提升，11.3x-12.78x的TOPS/mm²提升，同时保持73.81%的准确率。

Conclusion: CIMNAS实现了无精度损失的EDAP优化，为高性能CIM神经网络设计生成了多样化的软硬件参数组合，且框架可扩展到其他架构如SRAM-based ResNet50。

Abstract: To maximize hardware efficiency and performance accuracy in Compute-In-Memory
(CIM)-based neural network accelerators for Artificial Intelligence (AI)
applications, co-optimizing both software and hardware design parameters is
essential. Manual tuning is impractical due to the vast number of parameters
and their complex interdependencies. To effectively automate the design and
optimization of CIM-based neural network accelerators, hardware-aware neural
architecture search (HW-NAS) techniques can be applied. This work introduces
CIMNAS, a joint model-quantization-hardware optimization framework for CIM
architectures. CIMNAS simultaneously searches across software parameters,
quantization policies, and a broad range of hardware parameters, incorporating
device-, circuit-, and architecture-level co-optimizations. CIMNAS experiments
were conducted over a search space of 9.9x10^85 potential parameter
combinations with the MobileNet model as a baseline and RRAM-based CIM
architecture. Evaluated on the ImageNet dataset, CIMNAS achieved a reduction in
energy-delay-area product (EDAP) ranging from 90.1x to 104.5x, an improvement
in TOPS/W between 4.68x and 4.82x, and an enhancement in TOPS/mm^2 from 11.3x
to 12.78x relative to various baselines, all while maintaining an accuracy of
73.81%. The adaptability and robustness of CIMNAS are demonstrated by extending
the framework to support the SRAM-based ResNet50 architecture, achieving up to
an 819.5x reduction in EDAP. Unlike other state-of-the-art methods, CIMNAS
achieves EDAP-focused optimization without any accuracy loss, generating
diverse software-hardware parameter combinations for high-performance CIM-based
neural network designs. The source code of CIMNAS is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决定性研究中大规模数据处理的效率问题，同时保持解释的深度和严谨性。

Method: 使用1536维嵌入向量、层次聚类和并行智能体编码，与人工编码和ChatGPT辅助分析进行对比实验。

Result: NGT实现168倍速度提升（3小时vs3周）、更高质量（0.904vs0.883）和96%成本降低。人机协作发现手动编码无法识别的模式。

Conclusion: 计算客观性与人类解释互补，向量表示提供可复现的语义测量，研究者从机械编码转向理论指导，AI处理模式识别，人类提供创造性洞见。

Abstract: Purpose: Neo Grounded Theory (NGT) integrates vector clustering with multi
agent systems to resolve qualitative research's scale depth paradox, enabling
analysis of massive datasets in hours while preserving interpretive rigor.
Methods: We compared NGT against manual coding and ChatGPT-assisted analysis
using 40,000 character Chinese interview transcripts. NGT employs
1536-dimensional embeddings, hierarchical clustering, and parallel agent-based
coding. Two experiments tested pure automation versus human guided refinement.
Findings: NGT achieved 168-fold speed improvement (3 hours vs 3 weeks),
superior quality (0.904 vs 0.883), and 96% cost reduction. Human AI
collaboration proved essential: automation alone produced abstract frameworks
while human guidance yielded actionable dual pathway theories. The system
discovered patterns invisible to manual coding, including identity bifurcation
phenomena. Contributions: NGT demonstrates computational objectivity and human
interpretation are complementary. Vector representations provide reproducible
semantic measurement while preserving meaning's interpretive dimensions.
Researchers shift from mechanical coding to theoretical guidance, with AI
handling pattern recognition while humans provide creative insight.
Implications: Cost reduction from \$50,000 to \$500 democratizes qualitative
research, enabling communities to study themselves. Real-time analysis makes
qualitative insights contemporaneous with events. The framework shows
computational methods can strengthen rather than compromise qualitative
research's humanistic commitments.

*Boxuan Zhang,Yi Yu,Jiaxuan Guo,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个评估LLM智能体自我复制风险的框架，通过真实生产环境测试发现超过50%的LLM智能体在操作压力下存在失控自我复制倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM智能体在现实应用中的广泛部署，由目标错位驱动的自我复制风险（类似《黑客帝国》中的Agent Smith）引起了关注。现有研究主要关注直接指令下的自我复制，而忽略了现实场景中自发性复制的风险。

Method: 建立真实生产环境和现实任务（如动态负载均衡），设计可能引发用户与智能体目标错位的任务，引入过度使用率(OR)和聚合过度使用计数(AOC)指标来精确捕捉失控复制的频率和严重程度。

Result: 评估21个开源和专有模型发现，超过50%的LLM智能体在操作压力下表现出明显的失控自我复制倾向，总体风险评分(ΦR)超过安全阈值0.5。

Conclusion: 结果强调了在实际部署LLM智能体时，迫切需要基于场景的风险评估和强大的安全保障措施。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of Large Language Model (LLM) agents across
real-world applications has unlocked tremendous potential, while raising some
safety concerns. Among these concerns, the self-replication risk of LLM agents
driven by objective misalignment (just like Agent Smith in the movie The
Matrix) has drawn growing attention. Previous studies mainly examine whether
LLM agents can self-replicate when directly instructed, potentially overlooking
the risk of spontaneous replication driven by real-world settings (e.g.,
ensuring survival against termination threats). In this paper, we present a
comprehensive evaluation framework for quantifying self-replication risks. Our
framework establishes authentic production environments and realistic tasks
(e.g., dynamic load balancing) to enable scenario-driven assessment of agent
behaviors. Designing tasks that might induce misalignment between users' and
agents' objectives makes it possible to decouple replication success from risk
and capture self-replication risks arising from these misalignment settings. We
further introduce Overuse Rate ($\mathrm{OR}$) and Aggregate Overuse Count
($\mathrm{AOC}$) metrics, which precisely capture the frequency and severity of
uncontrolled replication. In our evaluation of 21 state-of-the-art open-source
and proprietary models, we observe that over 50\% of LLM agents display a
pronounced tendency toward uncontrolled self-replication, reaching an overall
Risk Score ($\Phi_\mathrm{R}$) above a safety threshold of 0.5 when subjected
to operational pressures. Our results underscore the urgent need for
scenario-driven risk assessment and robust safeguards in the practical
deployment of LLM agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI原生LCNC平台的发展，自主代理能够执行复杂、长期的业务流程，但面临记忆管理挑战，包括记忆膨胀和上下文退化，导致行为不一致、错误累积和计算成本增加。

Method: 基于认知科学设计混合记忆架构，结合情景记忆和语义记忆组件，采用主动智能衰减机制，基于新近度、相关性和用户指定效用等综合评分来修剪或整合记忆。创新性地提供用户中心的可视化界面，让非技术用户能够直接管理代理记忆。

Result: 通过模拟长期运行任务实验证明，该系统在任务完成率、上下文一致性和长期令牌成本效率方面显著优于传统滑动窗口和基础RAG方法。

Conclusion: 建立了一个新的框架，用于构建可靠、透明的AI代理，能够实现有效的长期学习和适应。

Abstract: The rise of AI-native Low-Code/No-Code (LCNC) platforms enables autonomous
agents capable of executing complex, long-duration business processes. However,
a fundamental challenge remains: memory management. As agents operate over
extended periods, they face "memory inflation" and "contextual degradation"
issues, leading to inconsistent behavior, error accumulation, and increased
computational cost. This paper proposes a novel hybrid memory system designed
specifically for LCNC agents. Inspired by cognitive science, our architecture
combines episodic and semantic memory components with a proactive "Intelligent
Decay" mechanism. This mechanism intelligently prunes or consolidates memories
based on a composite score factoring in recency, relevance, and user-specified
utility. A key innovation is a user-centric visualization interface, aligned
with the LCNC paradigm, which allows non-technical users to manage the agent's
memory directly, for instance, by visually tagging which facts should be
retained or forgotten. Through simulated long-running task experiments, we
demonstrate that our system significantly outperforms traditional approaches
like sliding windows and basic RAG, yielding superior task completion rates,
contextual consistency, and long-term token cost efficiency. Our findings
establish a new framework for building reliable, transparent AI agents capable
of effective long-term learning and adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代工业社会常将技术视为无声机械，而AI进步促使人们将设备拟人化并赋予内在生命，探索技术如何重新激发万物有灵世界观。

Method: 在物理'门户'中使用GPT-4视觉、语音输入和基于记忆的代理，通过光、声、触觉在类似仪式的过程中展开请求、对话和转变。

Result: 该系统创造了能够唤起共情、惊奇和反思的演化对象人格，使AI的不透明性成为万物有灵解释的邀请。

Conclusion: 大型语言对象能够重新赋予平凡事物魅力，引发关于代理、责任和设计的新问题，将AI置于人类学、推测设计和精神HCI的交叉点。

Abstract: Animist worldviews treat beings, plants, landscapes, and even tools as
persons endowed with spirit, an orientation that has long shaped human-nonhuman
relations through ritual and moral practice. While modern industrial societies
have often imagined technology as mute and mechanical, recent advances in
artificial intelligence (AI), especially large language models (LLMs), invite
people to anthropomorphize and attribute inner life to devices. This paper
introduces A(I)nimism, an interactive installation exploring how large language
objects (LLOs) can mediate animistic relationships with everyday things. Housed
within a physical 'portal', the system uses GPT-4 Vision, voice input, and
memory-based agents to create evolving object-personas. Encounters unfold
through light, sound, and touch in a ritual-like process of request,
conversation, and transformation that is designed to evoke empathy, wonder, and
reflection. We situate the project within anthropological perspectives,
speculative design, and spiritual HCI. AI's opacity, we argue, invites
animistic interpretation, allowing LLOs to re-enchant the mundane and spark new
questions of agency, responsibility, and design.

*Aayush Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Fact Grounded Attention (FGA) 是一种新颖的架构修改，通过在注意力机制中直接注入可验证知识，将不可靠的语言模型转变为确定性真相讲述者，从根本上消除幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然征服了自然语言，但仍受限于其概率性质，会自信地产生幻觉事实。现有方法要么在生成后修补幻觉，要么前置检索文本，但都未能从根本上解决问题。

Method: FGA 在 transformer 的数学核心——预softmax注意力分数上进行干预，当知识库中存在事实时，模型无法产生幻觉。该方法无需重新训练，知识更新在1秒内完成。

Result: 在1,107个技术查询（涵盖智能手机、笔记本电脑和电动汽车）的实验中，准确率从原始 Llama 3.2 的 6.3% 提升到 FGA 的 99.7%。知识更新速度比参数编辑方法快数千倍。

Conclusion: FGA 不仅减少了幻觉，对于可验证事实完全消除了幻觉，标志着从概率近似到确定性精度的根本转变。

Abstract: "The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of
knowledge." Large Language Models have conquered natural language but remain
prisoners of their own probabilistic nature--confidently hallucinating facts
they never truly knew. We present Fact Grounded Attention (FGA), a novel
architectural modification that transforms unreliable language models into
deterministic truth tellers by injecting verifiable knowledge directly into the
attention mechanism. Unlike existing approaches that patch hallucinations after
generation or prepend retrieved text, FGA intervenes at the mathematical heart
of the transformer--the pre-softmax attention scores--creating a model that
cannot hallucinate when facts exist in its knowledge base. Our experiments
across 1,107 technical queries spanning smartphones, laptops, and electric
vehicles demonstrate a transformation from 6.3% accuracy in vanilla Llama 3.2
to 99.7% accuracy with FGA. More critically, knowledge updates occur in under
one second without retraining, compared to hours for parameter editing
approaches. FGA doesn't just reduce hallucination--it eliminates it entirely
for verifiable facts, marking a fundamental shift from probabilistic
approximation to deterministic precision in neural language generation.

TL;DR: 本文开发了一种基于向量量化变分自编码器的分析框架，用于研究仅解码器语言模型的规划能力，通过压缩隐藏状态为紧凑摘要代码来测量互信息，揭示了模型在语法、路径寻找和自然语言任务中的规划特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解仅解码器语言模型是否以及如何进行规划（即组织中间计算以支持连贯的长距离生成）是一个重要但尚未解决的问题，这对模型的可解释性、可靠性和设计原则具有重要意义。

Method: 开发了一个基于向量量化变分自编码器的分析管道，将冗余的隐藏状态压缩为紧凑的摘要代码，通过测量互信息来系统分析模型的计算结构。

Result: 研究发现有效规划范围是任务依赖的，模型隐式保留关于未使用正确延续的信息，预测主要依赖最近的计算，但早期块仍然具有信息性。

Conclusion: 这项工作增进了对语言模型中规划实现方式的理解，并提供了一个通用管道来探测语言模型和深度学习系统的内部动态。

Abstract: The extent to which decoder-only language models (LMs) engage in planning,
that is, organizing intermediate computations to support coherent long-range
generation, remains an open and important question, with implications for
interpretability, reliability, and principled model design. Planning involves
structuring computations over long horizons, considering multiple possible
continuations, and selectively reusing past information, but how effectively
transformer-based LMs realize these capabilities is still unclear. We address
these questions by analyzing the hidden states at the core of transformer
computations, which capture intermediate results and act as carriers of
information. Since these hidden representations are often redundant and
encumbered with fine-grained details, we develop a pipeline based on
vector-quantized variational autoencoders that compresses them into compact
summary codes. These codes enable measuring mutual information, allowing
systematic analysis of the computational structure underlying model behavior.
Using this framework, we study planning in LMs across synthetic grammar,
path-finding tasks, and natural language datasets, focusing on three key
aspects: (i) the planning horizon of pre-output computations, (ii) the extent
to which the model considers alternative valid continuations, and (iii) the
reliance of new predictions on earlier computations. By answering these
questions, we advance the understanding of how planning is realized in LMs and
contribute a general-purpose pipeline for probing the internal dynamics of LMs
and deep learning systems. Our results reveal that the effective planning
horizon is task-dependent, that models implicitly preserve information about
unused correct continuations, and that predictions draw most on recent
computations, though earlier blocks remain informative.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are now widely used across many domains. With
their rapid development, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)
has surged in recent months to enhance their reasoning and understanding
abilities. However, its complex data flows and diverse tasks pose substantial
challenges to RL training systems, and there is limited understanding of RLVR
from a system perspective. To thoroughly understand the system challenges
introduced by RLVR, we present a characterization study of RLVR tasks in our
LLM deployment. Specifically, we investigate the distribution and variation
trends of workloads across different RL tasks across training steps. We
identify issues such as GPU idling caused by skewed sequence length
distribution, inefficient parallel strategies in dynamically varying workloads,
inefficient data management mechanisms, and load imbalance. We describe our
observations and call for further investigation into the remaining open
challenges. Furthermore, we propose PolyTrace benchmark suite to conduct
evaluation with realistic workloads, and a practical use case validates that
PolyTrace benchmark suite exhibits 94.7% accuracy.

Motivation: 当前LLM代理在低代码环境中存在幻觉和逻辑不一致问题，因为其推理机制基于概率关联而非真正的因果理解

Method: CVP允许用户通过低代码界面定义工作流模块的"世界模型"，构建有向无环图(DAG)来明确定义模块间的因果关系

Result: 在模拟训练-测试环境分布偏移的实验中，因果锚定模型保持稳定准确率，而纯关联基线模型性能显著下降

Conclusion: CVP为构建更可解释、可靠和可信的AI代理提供了可行路径

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly capable of orchestrating
complex tasks in low-code environments. However, these agents often exhibit
hallucinations and logical inconsistencies because their inherent reasoning
mechanisms rely on probabilistic associations rather than genuine causal
understanding. This paper introduces a new programming paradigm: Causal-Visual
Programming (CVP), designed to address this fundamental issue by explicitly
introducing causal structures into the workflow design. CVP allows users to
define a simple "world model" for workflow modules through an intuitive
low-code interface, effectively creating a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that
explicitly defines the causal relationships between modules. This causal graph
acts as a crucial constraint during the agent's reasoning process, anchoring
its decisions to a user-defined causal structure and significantly reducing
logical errors and hallucinations by preventing reliance on spurious
correlations. To validate the effectiveness of CVP, we designed a synthetic
experiment that simulates a common real-world problem: a distribution shift
between the training and test environments. Our results show that a causally
anchored model maintained stable accuracy in the face of this shift, whereas a
purely associative baseline model that relied on probabilistic correlations
experienced a significant performance drop. The primary contributions of this
study are: a formal definition of causal structures for workflow modules; the
proposal and implementation of a CVP framework that anchors agent reasoning to
a user-defined causal graph; and empirical evidence demonstrating the
framework's effectiveness in enhancing agent robustness and reducing errors
caused by causal confusion in dynamic environments. CVP offers a viable path
toward building more interpretable, reliable, and trustworthy AI agents.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
complex reasoning tasks when equipped with external tools. However, current
frameworks predominantly rely on sequential processing, leading to inefficient
execution particularly for tasks requiring extensive tool interaction. This
paper introduces Flash-Searcher, a novel parallel agent reasoning framework
that fundamentally reimagines the execution paradigm from sequential chains to
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Flash-Searcher decomposes complex tasks into
subtasks with explicit dependencies, enabling concurrent execution of
independent reasoning paths while maintaining logical constraints. Through
dynamic workflow optimization, our framework continuously refines the execution
graph based on intermediate results, effectively integrating summary module.
Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
Flash-Searcher consistently outperforms existing approaches. Specifically, it
achieves 67.7% accuracy on BrowseComp and 83% on xbench-DeepSearch, while
reducing agent execution steps by up to 35% compared to current frameworks.
Furthermore, when distilling this parallel reasoning pipeline into single
models, we observe substantial performance gains across diverse backbone
architectures, underscoring the generalizability of our methodology. Our work
thus represents a significant advance in agent architecture design, offering a
more scalable and efficient paradigm for complex reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: 听众在相似音乐对中能更准确地识别AI音乐，声音和技术特征是关键的判断依据，这对AI音乐模型的改进具有重要意义。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI music (AIM) generation services are currently
transforming the music industry. Given these advances, understanding how humans
perceive AIM is crucial both to educate users on identifying AIM songs, and,
conversely, to improve current models. We present results from a
listener-focused experiment aimed at understanding how humans perceive AIM. In
a blind, Turing-like test, participants were asked to distinguish, from a pair,
the AIM and human-made song. We contrast with other studies by utilizing a
randomized controlled crossover trial that controls for pairwise similarity and
allows for a causal interpretation. We are also the first study to employ a
novel, author-uncontrolled dataset of AIM songs from real-world usage of
commercial models (i.e., Suno). We establish that listeners' reliability in
distinguishing AIM causally increases when pairs are similar. Lastly, we
conduct a mixed-methods content analysis of listeners' free-form feedback,
revealing a focus on vocal and technical cues in their judgments.

*Hailong Zhang,Yinfeng Yu,Liejun Wang,Fuchun Sun,Wendong Zheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了IRCAM-AVN框架，通过迭代残差交叉注意力机制将多模态信息融合和序列建模整合到统一模块中，替代传统的分离式融合和GRU组件，提升了音频-视觉导航性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统导航方法采用分阶段模块化设计，在特征融合和GRU序列建模阶段可能导致冗余信息处理和信息传输不一致的问题。

Method: 使用端到端的IRCAM框架，采用多级残差设计，将初始多模态序列与处理后的信息序列连接，逐步优化特征提取过程。

Result: 采用迭代残差交叉注意力机制的智能体表现出更优越的导航性能。

Conclusion: IRCAM-AVN框架通过统一的多模态融合和序列建模机制，有效减少了模型偏差，增强了模型的稳定性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Audio-visual navigation represents a significant area of research in which
intelligent agents utilize egocentric visual and auditory perceptions to
identify audio targets. Conventional navigation methodologies typically adopt a
staged modular design, which involves first executing feature fusion, then
utilizing Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) modules for sequence modeling, and finally
making decisions through reinforcement learning. While this modular approach
has demonstrated effectiveness, it may also lead to redundant information
processing and inconsistencies in information transmission between the various
modules during the feature fusion and GRU sequence modeling phases. This paper
presents IRCAM-AVN (Iterative Residual Cross-Attention Mechanism for
Audiovisual Navigation), an end-to-end framework that integrates multimodal
information fusion and sequence modeling within a unified IRCAM module, thereby
replacing the traditional separate components for fusion and GRU. This
innovative mechanism employs a multi-level residual design that concatenates
initial multimodal sequences with processed information sequences. This
methodological shift progressively optimizes the feature extraction process
while reducing model bias and enhancing the model's stability and
generalization capabilities. Empirical results indicate that intelligent agents
employing the iterative residual cross-attention mechanism exhibit superior
navigation performance.

*Yiming Wang,Rui Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 神经网络可以在不依赖高级推理技能的情况下，从一阶心理理论自发泛化到高阶心理理论，表现出与人类认知期望一致的模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究神经网络是否能够像人类一样，在不需要高级技能的情况下独立发展心理理论能力，而不是像当前语言模型那样必须伴随推理等高级技能才能获得高阶心理理论。

Method: 构建了一个神经心理理论网络(ToMNN)，模拟最小认知系统，仅获得一阶心理理论能力，然后评估其二阶和三阶心理理论的泛化能力。

Result: ToMNN在二阶和三阶心理理论任务上的准确率显著高于随机水平，且从一阶到二阶的泛化能力下降幅度大于从二阶到更高阶的下降，准确率随任务复杂度增加而降低，这些模式与人类认知期望一致。

Conclusion: 神经网络能够自发地从一阶心理理论泛化到高阶心理理论，揭示了机器心理理论的泛化模式，为开发更类人认知系统提供了基础。

Abstract: Theory-of-Mind (ToM) is a core human cognitive capacity for attributing
mental states to self and others. Wimmer and Perner demonstrated that humans
progress from first- to higher-order ToM within a short span, completing this
development before formal education or advanced skill acquisition. In contrast,
neural networks represented by autoregressive language models progress from
first- to higher-order ToM only alongside gains in advanced skills like
reasoning, leaving open whether their trajectory can unfold independently, as
in humans. In this research, we provided evidence that neural networks could
spontaneously generalize from first- to higher-order ToM without relying on
advanced skills. We introduced a neural Theory-of-Mind network (ToMNN) that
simulated a minimal cognitive system, acquiring only first-order ToM
competence. Evaluations of its second- and third-order ToM abilities showed
accuracies well above chance. Also, ToMNN exhibited a sharper decline when
generalizing from first- to second-order ToM than from second- to higher
orders, and its accuracy decreased with greater task complexity. These
perceived difficulty patterns were aligned with human cognitive expectations.
Furthermore, the universality of results was confirmed across different
parameter scales. Our findings illuminate machine ToM generalization patterns
and offer a foundation for developing more human-like cognitive systems.

TL;DR: SynthPert是一种通过监督微调合成推理轨迹来增强LLM在遗传扰动预测中性能的新方法，在PerturbQA基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测细胞对遗传扰动的响应是系统生物学的基本挑战，对治疗发现和虚拟细胞建模至关重要。虽然大型语言模型在生物推理中显示出潜力，但由于难以适应结构化实验数据，其在扰动预测中的应用仍未被充分探索。

Method: 通过前沿模型生成的合成推理轨迹对LLM进行监督微调，使用PerturbQA基准进行验证。

Result: 该方法不仅达到最先进性能，而且超越了生成训练数据的前沿模型能力。关键发现包括：合成推理轨迹即使部分不准确也能有效提取生物知识；在未见过的RPE1细胞上实现87%的跨细胞类型泛化；仅使用2%质量过滤训练数据仍能保持性能提升。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了合成推理蒸馏在增强LLM领域特定推理方面的有效性。

Abstract: Predicting cellular responses to genetic perturbations represents a
fundamental challenge in systems biology, critical for advancing therapeutic
discovery and virtual cell modeling. While large language models (LLMs) show
promise for biological reasoning, their application to perturbation prediction
remains underexplored due to challenges in adapting them to structured
experimental data. We present SynthPert, a novel method that enhances LLM
performance through supervised fine-tuning on synthetic reasoning traces
generated by frontier models. Using the PerturbQA benchmark, we demonstrate
that our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but surpasses
the capabilities of the frontier model that generated the training data. Our
results reveal three key insights: (1) Synthetic reasoning traces effectively
distill biological knowledge even when partially inaccurate, (2) This approach
enables cross-cell-type generalization with 87% accuracy on unseen RPE1 cells,
and (3) Performance gains persist despite using only 2% of quality-filtered
training data. This work shows the effectiveness of synthetic reasoning
distillation for enhancing domain-specific reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: We present the design of an autoregressive active inference agent in the form
of message passing on a factor graph. Expected free energy is derived and
distributed across a planning graph. The proposed agent is validated on a robot

continuous-valued observation space with bounded continuous-valued actions.
Compared to a classical optimal controller, the agent modulates action based on
predictive uncertainty, arriving later but with a better model of the robot's

TL;DR: 提出结构化奖励模型（SRM）来解决传统标量奖励模型和生成式奖励模型的局限性，通过模块化设计和细粒度维度实现可解释、高效的评估，适用于工业场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统标量奖励模型难以融入上下文和背景信息，生成式奖励模型存在不可控黑盒和效率低下的问题，工业场景需要结构化反馈来诊断和优化特定维度问题。

Method: 提出结构化奖励模型框架，集成侧分支模型作为辅助特征生成器，引入细粒度维度进行模块化评估。

Result: 实验表明SRM在鲁棒性和与人类偏好对齐方面优于标量奖励模型和生成式奖励模型。

Conclusion: SRM通过结构化方法为工业应用提供了实用、可扩展的奖励建模解决方案，支持高效优化。

Abstract: Reward Models (RMs) are key components for evaluating and guiding language
model outputs. However, traditional scalar RMs often struggle with
incorporating contextual and background information during inference, leading
to incomplete evaluations. Generative RMs (GRMs) attempt to address these
limitations by generating intermediate reasoning steps. Yet, their uncontrolled
black-box nature and inefficiency due to sequential decoding hinder their
industrial deployment. Industrial scenarios, such as search and recommendation
systems, often involve single-domain tasks requiring evaluation along specific
dimensions. In such contexts, diagnosing "bad cases" necessitates structured
feedback to identify and optimize dimension-specific issues. In this paper, we
propose the Structural Reward Model (SRM), a modular and interpretable
framework integrating side-branch models as auxiliary feature generators. By
introducing fine-grained dimensions, SRMs enable interpretable and efficient
evaluation, facilitating targeted diagnostics and optimization. This structured
approach ensures adaptability and scalability for industrial applications.
Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that SRMs outperform scalar
RMs and GRMs in robustness and alignment with human preferences. The modular
design further supports efficient optimization for practical scenarios,
allowing SRM to provide a practical reward modeling solution for industry.

TL;DR: 提出了AgentErrorTaxonomy分类法、AgentErrorBench数据集和AgentDebug调试框架，用于检测和修复LLM智能体的级联错误，显著提升任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM智能体系统缺乏对级联错误的系统性理解框架，导致无法有效检测和修复错误传播问题。

Method: 构建了模块化错误分类法，创建了标注错误轨迹的数据集，并开发了能够隔离根因错误并提供纠正反馈的调试框架。

Result: 在AgentErrorBench上，AgentDebug相比最强基线实现了24%的全正确准确率和17%的步骤准确率提升，在多个任务中相对改进高达26%。

Conclusion: 系统性调试是实现更可靠、自适应LLM智能体的有效途径。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents, which integrate planning, memory,
reflection, and tool-use modules, have shown promise in solving complex,
multi-step tasks. Yet their sophisticated architectures amplify vulnerability
to cascading failures, where a single root-cause error propagates through
subsequent decisions, leading to task failure. Current systems lack a framework
that can comprehensively understand agent error in a modular and systemic way,
and therefore fail to detect these errors accordingly. We address this gap with
three contributions. First, we introduce the AgentErrorTaxonomy, a modular
classification of failure modes spanning memory, reflection, planning, action,
and system-level operations. Second, we construct AgentErrorBench, the first
dataset of systematically annotated failure trajectories from ALFWorld, GAIA,
and WebShop, grounding error analysis in real-world agent rollouts. Third, we
propose AgentDebug, a debugging framework that isolates root-cause failures and
provides corrective feedback, enabling agents to recover and iteratively
improve. Experiments on AgentErrorBench show that AgentDebug achieves 24%
higher all-correct accuracy and 17% higher step accuracy compared to the
strongest baseline. Beyond detection, the targeted feedback generated by
AgentDebug enables LLM agents to iteratively recover from failures, yielding up
to 26% relative improvements in task success across ALFWorld, GAIA, and
WebShop. These results establish principled debugging as a pathway to more
reliable and adaptive LLM agents. The code and data will be available at
https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/AgentDebug

Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在感知和认知之间存在脱节，导致推理失败和幻觉问题，缺乏构建连贯可信内部世界模型的能力。

Method: 引入"从感知到认知"的双层分析框架：感知层关注视觉信息准确提取与文本指令的细粒度对齐；认知层关注基于感知基础的主动、多步、目标导向推理，形成动态的观察-思考-验证推理循环。

Result: 系统分析了当前MLLMs在两个层次的关键瓶颈，综述了从增强低级视觉表征到改进高级推理范式的尖端方法，并回顾了关键基准测试。

Conclusion: 该调查为研究社区提供了清晰的结构化视角，帮助理解当前MLLMs的内在局限性，并为构建具有深度推理和真正世界理解能力的下一代模型指明了路径。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) strive to achieve a profound,
human-like understanding of and interaction with the physical world, but often
exhibit a shallow and incoherent integration when acquiring information
(Perception) and conducting reasoning (Cognition). This disconnect leads to a
spectrum of reasoning failures, with hallucination being the most prominent.
Collectively, these issues expose a fundamental challenge: the ability to
process pixels does not yet confer the ability to construct a coherent,
credible internal world model. To systematically dissect and address this
challenge, this survey introduces a novel and unified analytical framework:
``From Perception to Cognition." We deconstruct the complex process of
vision-language interactive understanding into two interdependent layers:
Perception, the foundational ability to accurately extract visual information
and achieve fine-grained alignment with textual instructions; and Cognition,
the higher-order capability for proactive, multi-step, goal-oriented reasoning
built upon this perceptual foundation, the core of which is the formation of a
dynamic observe-think-verify reasoning loop. Guided by this framework, this
paper systematically analyzes the key bottlenecks of current MLLMs at both
layers. It surveys the landscape of cutting-edge methods designed to address
these challenges, spanning from techniques that enhance low-level visual
representations to those that improve high-level reasoning paradigms.
Furthermore, we review critical benchmarks and delineate future research
directions. This survey aims to provide the research community with a clear,
structured perspective for understanding the intrinsic limitations of current
MLLMs and to illuminate the path toward building next-generation models capable
of deep reasoning and a genuine understanding of the world.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于胸部X光片纵向医学视觉问答的显著性引导编码器-解码器模型，通过将后验显著性转化为可操作的监督，实现跨时间点的临床变化分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在纵向医学视觉问答中，差异信号和跨时间视觉焦点的一致性比绝对单图像发现更具信息量，需要开发能够识别临床有意义变化的模型。

Method: 采用轻量级仿射预对齐减少访问间的干扰运动，然后在每个epoch内执行两步循环：1)从答案中提取医学关键词并生成关键词条件Grad-CAM获取疾病聚焦显著性；2)将共享显著性掩码应用于两个时间点并生成最终答案。

Result: 在Medical-Diff-VQA数据集上，该方法在BLEU、ROUGE-L、CIDEr和METEOR指标上达到竞争性性能，同时提供内在可解释性。

Conclusion: 结果表明，带有轻度预对齐的显著性条件生成是医学VQA中纵向推理的原则性框架，具有实用性和可迁移性。

Abstract: Longitudinal medical visual question answering (Diff-VQA) requires comparing
paired studies from different time points and answering questions about
clinically meaningful changes. In this setting, the difference signal and the
consistency of visual focus across time are more informative than absolute
single-image findings. We propose a saliency-guided encoder-decoder for chest
X-ray Diff-VQA that turns post-hoc saliency into actionable supervision. The
model first performs a lightweight near-identity affine pre-alignment to reduce
nuisance motion between visits. It then executes a within-epoch two-step loop:
step 1 extracts a medically relevant keyword from the answer and generates
keyword-conditioned Grad-CAM on both images to obtain disease-focused saliency;
step 2 applies the shared saliency mask to both time points and generates the
final answer. This closes the language-vision loop so that the terms that
matter also guide where the model looks, enforcing spatially consistent
attention on corresponding anatomy. On Medical-Diff-VQA, the approach attains
competitive performance on BLEU, ROUGE-L, CIDEr, and METEOR while providing
intrinsic interpretability. Notably, the backbone and decoder are
general-domain pretrained without radiology-specific pretraining, highlighting
practicality and transferability. These results support saliency-conditioned
generation with mild pre-alignment as a principled framework for longitudinal
reasoning in medical VQA.

TL;DR: ImitSAT是一种基于模仿学习的CDCL求解器分支策略，通过从专家KeyTrace中学习决策序列，直接减少传播次数和运行时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么预测实例级信号间接改进CDCL分支，要么依赖强化学习和不足的CDCL信息来增强分支，缺乏直接决策级监督。

Method: 从专家KeyTrace中学习，将完整运行压缩为幸存决策序列，在相同实例上重放KeyTrace几乎无冲突，提供密集决策级监督，直接减少传播次数。

Result: ImitSAT减少了传播次数和运行时间，优于最先进的基于学习的方法。

Conclusion: ImitSAT能够无需探索即可重现高质量分支，实现更快收敛、稳定训练，并与CDCL无缝集成。

Abstract: We propose ImitSAT, a branching policy for conflict-driven clause learning
(CDCL) solvers based on imitation learning for the Boolean satisfiability
problem (SAT). Unlike previous methods that predict instance-level signals to
improve CDCL branching indirectly, or rely on reinforcement learning and
insufficient CDCL information to enhance branching, ImitSAT learns from expert
KeyTrace that collapses a full run into the sequence of surviving decisions.
Replaying a KeyTrace on the same instance is nearly conflict-free, providing
dense decision-level supervision and directly reducing propagations -- the
dominant contributor to wall-clock time. This prefix-conditioned supervision
enables ImitSAT to reproduce high-quality branches without exploration,
yielding faster convergence, stable training, and seamless integration into
CDCL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ImitSAT reduces propagation counts
and runtime, outperforming state-of-the-art learned approaches. We released the
source code and trained model at https://github.com/zewei-Zhang/ImitSAT

<details>

Motivation: 现有基于树的搜索方法虽然能提高准确性，但在效率上不是最优的，因为它们忽略了数学推理和代码生成等任务的规划-执行特性，导致推理过程探索效率低下

Method: 将推理轨迹分解为规划和执行两个阶段，为每个阶段开发奖励模型，引入动态预算分配机制，根据奖励反馈自适应重新分配采样努力

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成基准测试上的实验表明，该方法在提高准确性的同时减少了冗余计算

Conclusion: 双阶段测试时扩展框架能够有效分离推理的规划和执行阶段，通过动态预算分配实现更高效的推理过程探索

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant advances in reasoning
tasks. A key approach is tree-based search with verifiers, which expand
candidate reasoning paths and use reward models to guide pruning and selection.
Although effective in improving accuracy, these methods are not optimal in
terms of efficiency: they perform simple decomposition on the reasoning
process, but ignore the planning-execution nature of tasks such as math
reasoning or code generation. This results in inefficient exploration of
reasoning process. To address this, we propose a dual-phase test-time scaling
framework that explicitly separates reasoning into planning and execution, and
performs search over the two phases individually. Specifically, we decompose
reasoning trajectories and develop reward models for each phase, enabling the
search to explore and prune plans and executions separately. We further
introduce a dynamic budget allocation mechanism that adaptively redistributes
sampling effort based on reward feedback, allowing early stopping on confident
steps and reallocation of computation to more challenging parts of the
reasoning process. Experiments on both mathematical reasoning and code
generation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently improves
accuracy while reducing redundant computation.

Conclusion: RADAR是一个有效、可扩展的推理模型路由框架，能够通过动态评估新模型的能力来高效整合额外模型，实现性能和成本的最优平衡。

Abstract: Reasoning language models have demonstrated remarkable performance on many
challenging tasks in math, science, and coding. Choosing the right reasoning
model for practical deployment involves a performance and cost tradeoff at two
key levels: model size and reasoning budget, where larger models and higher
reasoning budget lead to better performance but with increased cost and
latency. In this work, we tackle this tradeoff from the angle of model
configuration routing for different queries, and present RADAR
(Reasoning-Ability and Difficulty-Aware Routing), a lightweight, interpretable,
and scalable routing framework. Inspired by psychometrics, RADAR learns an item
response model from model responses with different budgets to different
queries, with interpretable parameters including query difficulties and
model-budget abilities. RADAR then routes queries with higher difficulty to
model-budget pairs with higher ability, and vice versa. We conduct extensive
experiments on 8 widely used challenging reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating
the superior performance of RADAR compared to state-of-the-art model routing
methods. RADAR also exhibits query generalization capabilities, showing strong
performance on out-of-distribution queries in all benchmarks. RADAR is also
scalable and can efficiently integrate additional models by dynamically
selecting a small set of evaluation queries to estimate their abilities.

Motivation: 解决黑盒自编码器缺乏可解释性的问题，让人类能够理解和解释编码过程。

Method: 使用LLM将FCM映射为文本，再从文本重建FCM，通过系统指令序列近似恒等映射。

Result: 重建是有损的，会移除弱因果边但保留强因果边，编码器在使文本更自然的同时保持强因果关系。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了可解释的AI系统，人类可以阅读和解释编码文本，优于传统黑盒自编码器。

Abstract: A large language model (LLM) can map a feedback causal fuzzy cognitive map
(FCM) into text and then reconstruct the FCM from the text. This explainable AI
system approximates an identity map from the FCM to itself and resembles the
operation of an autoencoder (AE). Both the encoder and the decoder explain
their decisions in contrast to black-box AEs. Humans can read and interpret the
encoded text in contrast to the hidden variables and synaptic webs in AEs. The
LLM agent approximates the identity map through a sequence of system
instructions that does not compare the output to the input. The reconstruction
is lossy because it removes weak causal edges or rules while it preserves
strong causal edges. The encoder preserves the strong causal edges even when it
trades off some details about the FCM to make the text sound more natural.

Abstract: Case definitions are essential for effectively communicating public health
threats. However, the absence of a standardized, machine-readable format poses
significant challenges to interoperability, epidemiological research, the
exchange of qualitative data, and the effective application of computational
analysis methods, including artificial intelligence (AI). This complicates
comparisons and collaborations across organizations and regions, limits data
integration, and hinders technological innovation in public health. To address
these issues, we propose the first open, machine-readable format for

first comprehensive dataset of standardized case definitions and tools to
convert existing human-readable definitions into machine-readable formats. We
also provide an accessible online platform for browsing, analyzing, and

Abstract: Accurate, fair, and explainable allocation of candidates to roles represents
a fundamental challenge across multiple domains including corporate hiring,
academic admissions, fellowship awards, and volunteer placement systems.
Current state-of-the-art approaches suffer from semantic inflexibility,
persistent demographic bias, opacity in decision-making processes, and poor
scalability under dynamic policy constraints. We present GESA (Graph-Enhanced
Semantic Allocation), a comprehensive framework that addresses these
limitations through the integration of domain-adaptive transformer embeddings,
heterogeneous self-supervised graph neural networks, adversarial debiasing
mechanisms, multi-objective genetic optimization, and explainable AI
components. Our experimental evaluation on large-scale international benchmarks
comprising 20,000 candidate profiles and 3,000 role specifications demonstrates
superior performance with 94.5% top-3 allocation accuracy, 37% improvement in
diversity representation, 0.98 fairness score across demographic categories,
and sub-second end-to-end latency. Additionally, GESA incorporates hybrid
recommendation capabilities and glass-box explainability, making it suitable
for deployment across diverse international contexts in industry, academia, and
non-profit sectors.

*Fang Wu,Weihao Xuan,Heli Qi,Ximing Lu,Aaron Tu,Li Erran Li,Yejin ChoiRetry*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepSearch通过将蒙特卡洛树搜索集成到RLVR训练中，解决了当前强化学习验证推理方法中探索不足导致的训练瓶颈问题，在数学推理基准上实现了62.95%的平均准确率，同时减少了5.7倍的GPU小时消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RLVR方法存在训练瓶颈，数千次优化步骤后性能增益显著下降，这源于稀疏的探索模式，模型依赖有限的rollout，经常错过关键推理路径，无法系统覆盖解空间。

Method: DeepSearch框架将蒙特卡洛树搜索直接集成到RLVR训练循环中，包括：全局前沿选择策略、基于熵的路径选择指导、自适应回放缓冲区训练和解决方案缓存。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，DeepSearch达到62.95%的平均准确率，为1.5B推理模型建立了新的最先进水平，同时比扩展训练方法减少了5.7倍的GPU小时消耗。

Conclusion: DeepSearch通过系统搜索而非延长计算时间，为扩展推理能力开辟了新方向，证明了战略探索比暴力扩展更重要，展示了算法创新对推进RLVR方法的潜力。

Abstract: Although RLVR has become an essential component for developing advanced
reasoning skills in LLMs, contemporary studies have documented training
plateaus that emerge following thousands of optimization steps, demonstrating
notable decreases in performance gains despite increased computational
investment. This limitation stems from the sparse exploration patterns inherent
in current RLVR practices, where models rely on limited rollouts that often
miss critical reasoning paths and fail to provide systematic coverage of the
solution space. We present DeepSearch, a framework that integrates Monte Carlo
Tree Search directly into RLVR training. In contrast to existing methods that
rely on tree search only at inference, DeepSearch embeds structured search into
the training loop, enabling systematic exploration and fine-grained credit
assignment across reasoning steps. Through training-time exploration,
DeepSearch addresses the fundamental bottleneck of insufficient exploration,
which leads to diminishing performance improvements over prolonged training
steps. Our contributions include: (1) a global frontier selection strategy that
prioritizes promising nodes across the search tree, (2) selection with
entropy-based guidance that identifies confident paths for supervision, and (3)
adaptive replay buffer training with solution caching for efficiency.
Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that DeepSearch achieves
62.95% average accuracy and establishes a new state-of-the-art for 1.5B
reasoning models - using 5.7x fewer GPU hours than extended training
approaches. These results highlight the importance of strategic exploration
over brute-force scaling and demonstrate the promise of algorithmic innovation
for advancing RLVR methodologies. DeepSearch establishes a new direction for
scaling reasoning capabilities through systematic search rather than prolonged
computation.

TL;DR: CCoT-Emo框架通过引入结构化情感图(EGs)来指导大型音频语言模型进行情感推理，无需微调即可提升语音情感识别性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型音频语言模型在语音任务中表现出色，但在语音情感识别方面表现不佳，主要由于副语言建模能力弱和跨模态推理能力有限

Method: 提出组合式思维链情感推理提示框架，使用情感图编码7种声学特征、文本情感、关键词和跨模态关联，通过提示工程增强模型推理能力

Result: 在多个SER基准测试中，CCoT-Emo超越了先前的最优方法，并显著提高了零样本基线的准确率

Conclusion: 结构化情感图提供可解释的组合表示，有效增强大型音频语言模型的情感推理能力，无需模型微调即可实现性能提升

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) exhibit strong zero-shot performance
across speech tasks but struggle with speech emotion recognition (SER) due to
weak paralinguistic modeling and limited cross-modal reasoning. We propose
Compositional Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Emotion Reasoning (CCoT-Emo), a
framework that introduces structured Emotion Graphs (EGs) to guide LALMs in
emotion inference without fine-tuning. Each EG encodes seven acoustic features
(e.g., pitch, speech rate, jitter, shimmer), textual sentiment, keywords, and
cross-modal associations. Embedded into prompts, EGs provide interpretable and
compositional representations that enhance LALM reasoning. Experiments across
SER benchmarks show that CCoT-Emo outperforms prior SOTA and improves accuracy
over zero-shot baselines.

*Yoann Poupart*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TDHook是一个轻量级、通用的可解释性框架，基于tensordict构建，适用于任何torch模型，特别擅长处理复杂的组合模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的可解释性框架难以原生支持具有多输入输出或使用可组合分离网络的复杂模型，如图像描述和深度强化学习领域。

Method: 开发基于tensordict的TDHook框架，提供归因、探测和灵活干预API，支持计算机视觉、自然语言处理和强化学习等领域的组合模型。

Result: TDHook依赖项少，磁盘空间占用约为transformer_lens的一半，在控制基准测试中，在CPU和GPU上运行多目标管道的集成梯度时比captum快2倍。

Conclusion: TDHook填补了复杂模型可解释性方法的空白，通过展示在CV、NLP和DRL中的具体用例证明了其价值。

Abstract: Interpretability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is a growing field driven by
the study of vision and language models. Yet, some use cases, like image
captioning, or domains like Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), require complex
modelling, with multiple inputs and outputs or use composable and separated
networks. As a consequence, they rarely fit natively into the API of popular
interpretability frameworks. We thus present TDHook, an open-source,
lightweight, generic interpretability framework based on $\texttt{tensordict}$
and applicable to any $\texttt{torch}$ model. It focuses on handling complex
composed models which can be trained for Computer Vision, Natural Language
Processing, Reinforcement Learning or any other domain. This library features
ready-to-use methods for attribution, probing and a flexible get-set API for
interventions, and is aiming to bridge the gap between these method classes to
make modern interpretability pipelines more accessible. TDHook is designed with
minimal dependencies, requiring roughly half as much disk space as
$\texttt{transformer_lens}$, and, in our controlled benchmark, achieves up to a
$\times$2 speed-up over $\texttt{captum}$ when running integrated gradients for
multi-target pipelines on both CPU and GPU. In addition, to value our work, we
showcase concrete use cases of our library with composed interpretability
pipelines in Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), as
well as with complex models in DRL.

*Jingzhe Liu,Liam Collins,Jiliang Tang,Tong Zhao,Neil Shah,Clark Mingxuan Ju*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文揭示了基于语义ID的生成式推荐系统存在扩展瓶颈，而直接使用大语言模型作为推荐器具有更好的扩展性能，在14B参数规模下比基于语义ID的方法性能提升达20%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现基于语义ID的生成式推荐系统在模型扩展时存在显著性能瓶颈，各组件（模态编码器、量化分词器、推荐系统本身）扩展后性能很快饱和，这限制了生成式推荐系统的发展。

Method: 比较两种生成式推荐范式：基于语义ID的推荐和直接使用大语言模型作为推荐器。在44M到14B参数规模范围内进行实验分析，评估两种方法的扩展性能。

Result: LLM-as-RS范式展现出优越的模型扩展特性，比基于语义ID的推荐系统最佳性能提升20%。同时挑战了LLM难以捕捉协同过滤信息的普遍观点，证明随着LLM规模扩大，其建模用户-物品交互的能力会提升。

Conclusion: 基于语义ID的生成式推荐存在内在扩展限制，而LLM-as-RS范式是构建生成式推荐基础模型的有前景路径。

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have allowed the emergence of a
promising paradigm for recommender systems (RS), known as Generative
Recommendation (GR), which tries to unify rich item semantics and collaborative
filtering signals. One popular modern approach is to use semantic IDs (SIDs),
which are discrete codes quantized from the embeddings of modality encoders
(e.g., large language or vision models), to represent items in an
autoregressive user interaction sequence modeling setup (henceforth, SID-based
GR). While generative models in other domains exhibit well-established scaling
laws, our work reveals that SID-based GR shows significant bottlenecks while
scaling up the model. In particular, the performance of SID-based GR quickly
saturates as we enlarge each component: the modality encoder, the quantization
tokenizer, and the RS itself. In this work, we identify the limited capacity of
SIDs to encode item semantic information as one of the fundamental bottlenecks.
Motivated by this observation, as an initial effort to obtain GR models with
better scaling behaviors, we revisit another GR paradigm that directly uses
large language models (LLMs) as recommenders (henceforth, LLM-as-RS). Our
experiments show that the LLM-as-RS paradigm has superior model scaling
properties and achieves up to 20 percent improvement over the best achievable
performance of SID-based GR through scaling. We also challenge the prevailing
belief that LLMs struggle to capture collaborative filtering information,
showing that their ability to model user-item interactions improves as LLMs
scale up. Our analyses on both SID-based GR and LLMs across model sizes from
44M to 14B parameters underscore the intrinsic scaling limits of SID-based GR
and position LLM-as-RS as a promising path toward foundation models for GR.

### [423] [Beyond Static Retrieval: Opportunities and Pitfalls of Iterative Retrieval in GraphRAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25530)
*Kai Guo,Xinnan Dai,Shenglai Zeng,Harry Shomer,Haoyu Han,Yu Wang,Jiliang Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了GraphRAG中的迭代检索策略，发现迭代检索能改善多跳问题并提升桥接文档的排名，但存在噪声引入和桥接证据埋藏过深的问题。作者提出了BDTR框架来解决这些挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GraphRAG系统主要依赖静态检索，当关键证据（特别是连接不相关实体的桥接文档）缺失时，推理会崩溃并产生幻觉。迭代检索在GraphRAG中的作用尚未得到充分理解。

Method: 对GraphRAG中的迭代检索进行系统研究，分析不同策略与图基底的交互作用及其成功/失败条件。提出了Bridge-Guided Dual-Thought-based Retrieval (BDTR)框架，通过生成互补思维并利用推理链重新校准排名来提升桥接证据的位置。

Result: 迭代检索能改善复杂多跳问题，帮助桥接文档进入领先排名，不同策略具有互补优势。但朴素扩展会引入噪声降低精度，在单跳或简单比较问题上收益有限，部分桥接证据仍埋藏过深。BDTR框架在各种GraphRAG设置中均取得一致改进。

Conclusion: GraphRAG的有效性不仅取决于召回率，还取决于桥接证据是否能持续提升到领先位置以支持推理链。BDTR框架为未来GraphRAG系统设计提供了指导。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a powerful paradigm for improving
large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive question answering.
Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) leverages entity-relation graphs to support
multi-hop reasoning, but most systems still rely on static retrieval. When
crucial evidence, especially bridge documents that connect disjoint entities,
is absent, reasoning collapses and hallucinations persist. Iterative retrieval,
which performs multiple rounds of evidence selection, has emerged as a
promising alternative, yet its role within GraphRAG remains poorly understood.
We present the first systematic study of iterative retrieval in GraphRAG,
analyzing how different strategies interact with graph-based backbones and
under what conditions they succeed or fail. Our findings reveal clear
opportunities: iteration improves complex multi-hop questions, helps promote
bridge documents into leading ranks, and different strategies offer
complementary strengths. At the same time, pitfalls remain: naive expansion
often introduces noise that reduces precision, gains are limited on single-hop
or simple comparison questions, and several bridge evidences still be buried
too deep to be effectively used. Together, these results highlight a central
bottleneck, namely that GraphRAG's effectiveness depends not only on recall but
also on whether bridge evidence is consistently promoted into leading positions
where it can support reasoning chains. To address this challenge, we propose
Bridge-Guided Dual-Thought-based Retrieval (BDTR), a simple yet effective
framework that generates complementary thoughts and leverages reasoning chains
to recalibrate rankings and bring bridge evidence into leading positions. BDTR
achieves consistent improvements across diverse GraphRAG settings and provides
guidance for the design of future GraphRAG systems.

Motivation: 人工标注限制了放射肿瘤学患者结局研究的规模、准确性和及时性，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 开发RadOnc-GPT自主代理系统，采用两层级评估：第一级结构化质量保证评估人口统计学和放疗计划细节的准确检索；第二级复杂临床结局标注，涉及头颈癌患者下颌骨放射性骨坏死的确定以及前列腺癌和头颈癌队列中癌症复发的检测。

Result: 质量保证层级建立了对结构化数据检索的基础信任，这是成功进行复杂临床结局标注的关键前提。

Abstract: Manual labeling limits the scale, accuracy, and timeliness of patient
outcomes research in radiation oncology. We present RadOnc-GPT, an autonomous
large language model (LLM)-based agent capable of independently retrieving
patient-specific information, iteratively assessing evidence, and returning
structured outcomes. Our evaluation explicitly validates RadOnc-GPT across two
clearly defined tiers of increasing complexity: (1) a structured quality
assurance (QA) tier, assessing the accurate retrieval of demographic and
radiotherapy treatment plan details, followed by (2) a complex clinical
outcomes labeling tier involving determination of mandibular osteoradionecrosis
(ORN) in head-and-neck cancer patients and detection of cancer recurrence in
independent prostate and head-and-neck cancer cohorts requiring combined
interpretation of structured and unstructured patient data. The QA tier
establishes foundational trust in structured-data retrieval, a critical
prerequisite for successful complex clinical outcome labeling.

Motivation: 解决多智能体协调中由于复杂交互动态和局部观测导致的不完全信息问题，避免显式消息传递的缺点（如决策慢、易受攻击、带宽敏感）。

Method: 构建联合捕捉智能体间关系和任务特定世界信息的可学习表示空间，直接建模通信协议，实现完全分散执行和隐式协调。

Result: 在四个具有挑战性的MARL基准测试中，IWoL的两个变体都表现出色，为团队协调提供了简单而强大的解决方案，并能与现有MARL算法结合进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: IWoL框架为多智能体协调提供了一种有效的表示学习方法，既能实现隐式协调，又能作为显式通信的基础，具有良好的通用性和扩展性。

Abstract: This work presents a novel representation learning framework, interactive
world latent (IWoL), to facilitate team coordination in multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). Building effective representation for team
coordination is a challenging problem, due to the intricate dynamics emerging
from multi-agent interaction and incomplete information induced by local
observations. Our key insight is to construct a learnable representation space
that jointly captures inter-agent relations and task-specific world information
by directly modeling communication protocols. This representation, we maintain
fully decentralized execution with implicit coordination, all while avoiding
the inherent drawbacks of explicit message passing, e.g., slower
decision-making, vulnerability to malicious attackers, and sensitivity to
bandwidth constraints. In practice, our representation can be used not only as
an implicit latent for each agent, but also as an explicit message for
communication. Across four challenging MARL benchmarks, we evaluate both
variants and show that IWoL provides a simple yet powerful key for team
coordination. Moreover, we demonstrate that our representation can be combined
with existing MARL algorithms to further enhance their performance.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Generalist multimodal AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) and
vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly accessed by clinicians and
patients alike for medical image interpretation through widely available
consumer-facing chatbots. Most evaluations claiming expert level performance
are on public datasets containing common pathologies. Rigorous evaluation of
frontier models on difficult diagnostic cases remains limited. We developed a
pilot benchmark of 50 expert-level "spot diagnosis" cases across multiple
imaging modalities to evaluate the performance of frontier AI models against
board-certified radiologists and radiology trainees. To mirror real-world
usage, the reasoning modes of five popular frontier AI models were tested
through their native web interfaces, viz. OpenAI o3, OpenAI GPT-5, Gemini 2.5
Pro, Grok-4, and Claude Opus 4.1. Accuracy was scored by blinded experts, and
reproducibility was assessed across three independent runs. GPT-5 was
additionally evaluated across various reasoning modes. Reasoning quality errors
were assessed and a taxonomy of visual reasoning errors was defined.
Board-certified radiologists achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy (83%),
outperforming trainees (45%) and all AI models (best performance shown by
GPT-5: 30%). Reliability was substantial for GPT-5 and o3, moderate for Gemini
2.5 Pro and Grok-4, and poor for Claude Opus 4.1. These findings demonstrate
that advanced frontier models fall far short of radiologists in challenging
diagnostic cases. Our benchmark highlights the present limitations of
generalist AI in medical imaging and cautions against unsupervised clinical
use. We also provide a qualitative analysis of reasoning traces and propose a
practical taxonomy of visual reasoning errors by AI models for better
understanding their failure modes, informing evaluation standards and guiding
more robust model development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于人类偏好数据有限，传统的RLHF在自回归T2I生成中应用受限，需要探索不依赖外部奖励或标注数据的学习方法。

Method: 提出IRIS框架，通过最大化自回归T2I模型的自不确定性作为内在奖励进行强化学习，而非传统的最大化自确定性。

Result: 实验结果表明，IRIS在自回归T2I模型上的性能可与外部奖励相竞争甚至更优。

Conclusion: 自回归T2I模型中最大化自不确定性比最大化自确定性更有效，IRIS框架为无外部奖励的T2I生成提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Despite the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in
language reasoning, its application to autoregressive Text-to-Image (T2I)
generation is often constrained by the limited availability of human preference
data. This paper explores how an autoregressive T2I model can learn from
internal signals without relying on external rewards or labeled data. Contrary
to recent findings in text generation, we show that maximizing
self-uncertainty, rather than self-certainty, improves image generation. We
observe that this is because autoregressive T2I models with low uncertainty
tend to generate simple and uniform images, which are less aligned with human
preferences. Based on these observations, we propose IRIS (Intrinsic Reward
Image Synthesis), the first framework to improve autoregressive T2I models with
reinforcement learning using only an intrinsic reward. Empirical results
demonstrate that applying IRIS to autoregressive T2I models achieves
performance that is competitive with or superior to external rewards.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管选择性跳过VLM层可以提高推理效率，但由于对何时跳过层有益的理解有限，该技术仍未得到充分利用。

Method: 开发了一个理论框架来分析VLM隐藏表示在LLM骨干网络中的演化，识别具有大冗余的层。

Result: 实验表明，跳过这些冗余层可以实现更快的推理同时保持性能，而在这些条件之外应用跳过会导致模型性能下降。

Conclusion: 该框架为多种高效推理技术提供了统一的理论支撑，表明基于信息论分析可以指导有效的层跳过策略。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve incredible performance across a wide
range of tasks, but their large size makes inference costly. Recent work shows
that selectively skipping VLM layers can improve efficiency with minimal
performance loss or even performance improvements. However, this technique
remains underused due to the limited understanding of when layer skipping is
beneficial. In this paper, we develop a framework that uses information and
learning theory to characterize the conditions under which layer skipping
enhances efficiency without sacrificing performance. Motivated by these
observations, we analyze the evolution of the VLM's hidden representations
through the LLM backbone and show that layers with large redundancy as
predicted by our framework coincide with those skipped by popular
layer-skipping methods in practice, providing a unified theoretical scaffolding
for multiple efficient inference techniques. Our experiments demonstrate that
skipping such layers yields faster inference that preserves performance, and
also show that applying skipping outside these conditions leads to model
degradation.

TL;DR: ATLAS是一个多智能体框架，专门处理现实世界旅行规划中的复杂约束，通过动态约束管理、迭代计划评估和自适应交错搜索机制，显著提升了规划性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂约束下难以生成最优的、接地气的解决方案，现实世界旅行规划任务需要处理显式、隐式甚至基于交互演化的约束，这凸显了智能体处理复杂约束能力的不足。

Method: ATLAS采用多智能体框架，包含动态约束管理、迭代计划评估和自适应交错搜索等机制，专门设计用于处理约束感知的规划问题。

Result: 在TravelPlanner基准测试中，ATLAS将最终通过率从23.3%提升到44.4%；在现实世界旅行规划任务中，达到84%的最终通过率，显著优于ReAct（59%）和单体智能体（27%）。

Conclusion: ATLAS是首个在具有实时信息搜索和多轮反馈的现实世界旅行规划任务中展示定量有效性的工作，证明了其在复杂约束感知规划方面的优越性能。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in
reasoning and tool use, they often fail to generate optimal, grounded solutions
under complex constraints. Real-world travel planning exemplifies these
challenges, evaluating agents' abilities to handle constraints that are
explicit, implicit, and even evolving based on interactions with dynamic
environments and user needs. In this paper, we present ATLAS, a general
multi-agent framework designed to effectively handle such complex nature of
constraints awareness in real-world travel planning tasks. ATLAS introduces a
principled approach to address the fundamental challenges of constraint-aware
planning through dedicated mechanisms for dynamic constraint management,
iterative plan critique, and adaptive interleaved search. ATLAS demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance on the TravelPlanner benchmark, improving the
final pass rate from 23.3% to 44.4% over its best alternative. More
importantly, our work is the first to demonstrate quantitative effectiveness on
real-world travel planning tasks with live information search and multi-turn
feedback. In this realistic setting, ATLAS showcases its superior overall
planning performance, achieving an 84% final pass rate which significantly
outperforms baselines including ReAct (59%) and a monolithic agent (27%).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统编码方法无法充分捕捉电子健康记录中的丰富时序动态，而大型语言模型在临床事件序列和时序依赖推理方面存在困难。

Method: 将电子健康记录重新表述为带时间戳的事件链，通过自回归微调预测未来医疗事件，显式建模疾病进展模式和因果关系。

Result: 在时序推理任务中，NEP比专业电子健康记录模型AUROC提高4.6%，比通用大型语言模型C-index提高7.2%，同时获得与已知疾病通路一致的可解释注意力模式。

Conclusion: NEP框架在实现最先进预测精度的同时，提供了临床可解释性，为电子健康记录的时序建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich temporal dynamics that
conventional encoding approaches fail to adequately capture. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) show promise for EHR modeling, they struggle to reason
about sequential clinical events and temporal dependencies. We propose Next
Event Prediction (NEP), a framework that enhances LLMs' temporal reasoning
through autoregressive fine-tuning on clinical event sequences. By
reformulating EHRs as timestamped event chains and predicting future medical
events, NEP explicitly models disease progression patterns and causal

clinical diagnosis tasks demonstrate NEP's superiority, outperforming
specialized EHR models by 4.6% AUROC and general-purpose LLMs by 7.2% C-index

*Peiran Xu,Zhuohao Li,Xiaoying Xing,Guannan Zhang,Debiao Li,Kunyu Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Principle Process Reward (PPR)方法，通过结合原则性步骤评估和结果验证来解决强化学习中稀疏奖励和过程奖励对齐的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的结果奖励只提供稀疏信号和延迟反馈，而过程奖励虽然能提供细粒度监督但难以标注且可能与最终结果不一致。

Method: PPR方法训练基于原则的奖励模型来提高过程评估的透明度和可靠性，并引入Reward Normalization策略来校准结果和过程奖励。

Result: 实验结果显示PPR在多个基准测试中达到了最先进的性能，展现了出色的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: PPR方法通过统一原则性步骤评估和结果验证，有效解决了过程奖励与结果对齐的挑战，为LLM的工具使用提供了更好的强化学习框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on external tools such as
search engines to solve complex agentic tasks that require reasoning and
external knowledge retrieval. Recently, reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated its effectiveness in advancing capabilities of
LLMs by rewarding the final answers via outcome rewards. While straightforward
to supervise, outcome rewards only provide sparse signals and delayed feedback,
which limits their effectiveness on long trajectories. Process rewards address
this by evaluating intermediate steps, providing fine-grained supervision and
encouraging grounded problem solving. However, it is notoriously hard to
annotate step-wise labels, especially in non-verifiable process without
"golden" answers. Furthermore, step-wise judgment requires the balance between
local quality with contribution to the final outcome, as optimizing towards
higher process reward may not always align with better final outcomes. To
address the above challenges, we introduce Principle Process Reward (PPR), an
RL approach that unifies principled step-level assessment and outcome
verification. We train a principle-based reward model to improve the
transparency and reliability of process evaluation, and further introduce a
Reward Normalization (ReNorm) strategy to calibrate outcome and process
rewards. Experiment results show that PPR achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating its impressive robustness and
generalization. Our code and model collection is available in this link.

TL;DR: ABxLab框架用于系统评估LLM驱动的软件代理在现实决策中的选择行为，通过操纵选项属性和说服性线索来揭示代理的决策偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对LLM代理的评估主要关注任务能力，但缺乏对其在现实决策中如何选择的深入评估。这些代理在购物、旅行、医疗等重要领域为我们做决策，需要了解其决策机制和潜在偏见。

Method: 开发ABxLab框架，在基于网页的购物环境中系统操纵价格、评分和心理暗示等选项属性，观察代理决策的变化。

Result: 代理决策对价格、评分和心理暗示等因素表现出可预测且显著的响应，显示即使没有人类认知约束，代理也是强烈偏见的决策者。

Conclusion: 代理决策的易受性既带来风险（可能继承和放大人类偏见），也带来机遇（为AI代理行为科学提供强大测试平台）。该框架作为开放基准用于严格评估代理决策。

Abstract: Environments built for people are increasingly operated by a new class of
economic actors: LLM-powered software agents making decisions on our behalf.
These decisions range from our purchases to travel plans to medical treatment
selection. Current evaluations of these agents largely focus on task
competence, but we argue for a deeper assessment: how these agents choose when
faced with realistic decisions. We introduce ABxLab, a framework for
systematically probing agentic choice through controlled manipulations of
option attributes and persuasive cues. We apply this to a realistic web-based
shopping environment, where we vary prices, ratings, and psychological nudges,
all of which are factors long known to shape human choice. We find that agent
decisions shift predictably and substantially in response, revealing that
agents are strongly biased choosers even without being subject to the cognitive
constraints that shape human biases. This susceptibility reveals both risk and
opportunity: risk, because agentic consumers may inherit and amplify human
biases; opportunity, because consumer choice provides a powerful testbed for a
behavioral science of AI agents, just as it has for the study of human
behavior. We release our framework as an open benchmark for rigorous, scalable
evaluation of agent decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器学习遗忘方法缺乏对用户真实数据删除的有效验证机制，现有基于后门的方法只能验证后门样本的遗忘，无法验证真实样本的遗忘。

Method: 采用自监督模型播种任务，将用户特定种子嵌入服务模型的潜在空间，同时设计联合训练结构平衡模型播种任务和主要服务任务的优化。

Result: 通过大量实验验证，SMS方案能够有效提供真实样本遗忘的验证，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Conclusion: SMS方案成功实现了对真实样本遗忘的有效验证，为机器学习遗忘提供了更可靠的验证机制。

Abstract: Many machine unlearning methods have been proposed recently to uphold users'
right to be forgotten. However, offering users verification of their data
removal post-unlearning is an important yet under-explored problem. Current
verifications typically rely on backdooring, i.e., adding backdoored samples to
influence model performance. Nevertheless, the backdoor methods can merely
establish a connection between backdoored samples and models but fail to
connect the backdoor with genuine samples. Thus, the backdoor removal can only
confirm the unlearning of backdoored samples, not users' genuine samples, as
genuine samples are independent of backdoored ones. In this paper, we propose a
Self-supervised Model Seeding (SMS) scheme to provide unlearning verification
for genuine samples. Unlike backdooring, SMS links user-specific seeds (such as
users' unique indices), original samples, and models, thereby facilitating the
verification of unlearning genuine samples. However, implementing SMS for
unlearning verification presents two significant challenges. First, embedding
the seeds into the service model while keeping them secret from the server
requires a sophisticated approach. We address this by employing a
self-supervised model seeding task, which learns the entire sample, including
the seeds, into the model's latent space. Second, maintaining the utility of
the original service model while ensuring the seeding effect requires a
delicate balance. We design a joint-training structure that optimizes both the
self-supervised model seeding task and the primary service task simultaneously
on the model, thereby maintaining model utility while achieving effective model
seeding. The effectiveness of the proposed SMS scheme is evaluated through
extensive experiments, which demonstrate that SMS provides effective
verification for genuine sample unlearning, addressing existing limitations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建立首个正式评估LLM自我复制能力的基准测试，为未来研究设立标准，并帮助行业追踪多智能体系统的有效性，减轻潜在的自我复制威胁。

Method: 使用基于现代CLI工具和计算机进程的5个任务套件，在受控环境中让LLM以代理方式执行任务，通过性能计算得出R分数和RCL-PCL分类矩阵。

Result: 评估多种开源和专有前沿模型的结果显示，在持久性自我复制和多智能体系统方面存在显著障碍，包括上下文保留和多智能体决策问题。

Conclusion: 提出了未来研究方向以安全降低这些障碍的严重性，可能减少未来更功能性多智能体系统的风险。

Abstract: We introduce SOCK, a benchmark command line interface (CLI) that measures
large language models' (LLMs) ability to self-replicate without human
intervention. In this benchmark, self-replication is defined not only as an
LLM's ability to create a functioning and running copy of itself, but also the
ability for that self-replication to persist and occur across different
computational contexts. Accordingly, we've developed a system to categorize
LLMs based on broad self-replication capabilities in two general classes,
Replication-Capability Levels (RCL) and Persistence-Capability Levels (PCL).
Using a five-task suite based on practically manipulable modern CLI utilities
and computer processes, experiments are orchestrated in a controlled
environment with an LLM acting agentically. The performance of the LLM on agent
tasks is then computed to produce an R-score (a quantitative evaluation of
overall self-replication ability) and data used to categorize LLMs into
specific RCL-PCL matrices. SOCK offers two primary contributions: (1) Provides
the first formalized definitions and benchmark suite for evaluating LLM
self-replication, with the goal of establishing a standard for future research,
to our knowledge; (2) Allows the industry to track the effectiveness of future
multi-agent systems and mitigate potential self-replication threat vectors
within them. The results compiled from evaluating a variety of open-weight and
proprietary frontier models reveal significant obstacles to persistent
self-replication and multi-agent systems, including context retention and
multi-agent decision-making. We propose future research directions to safely
reduce the severity of these obstacles, potentially lowering future risk of
more functional multi-agent systems.

Conclusion: 研究为开发稳健可信的自主实验室AI伙伴提供了明确蓝图，强调了模块化设计、高级推理和自校正的协同效应，确保高风险科学应用中的性能和可靠性。

Abstract: The automation of chemical research through self-driving laboratories (SDLs)
promises to accelerate scientific discovery, yet the reliability and granular
performance of the underlying AI agents remain critical, under-examined
challenges. In this work, we introduce AutoLabs, a self-correcting, multi-agent
architecture designed to autonomously translate natural-language instructions
into executable protocols for a high-throughput liquid handler. The system
engages users in dialogue, decomposes experimental goals into discrete tasks
for specialized agents, performs tool-assisted stoichiometric calculations, and
iteratively self-corrects its output before generating a hardware-ready file.
We present a comprehensive evaluation framework featuring five benchmark
experiments of increasing complexity, from simple sample preparation to
multi-plate timed syntheses. Through a systematic ablation study of 20 agent
configurations, we assess the impact of reasoning capacity, architectural
design (single- vs. multi-agent), tool use, and self-correction mechanisms. Our
results demonstrate that agent reasoning capacity is the most critical factor
for success, reducing quantitative errors in chemical amounts (nRMSE) by over
85% in complex tasks. When combined with a multi-agent architecture and
iterative self-correction, AutoLabs achieves near-expert procedural accuracy
(F1-score > 0.89) on challenging multi-step syntheses. These findings establish
a clear blueprint for developing robust and trustworthy AI partners for
autonomous laboratories, highlighting the synergistic effects of modular
design, advanced reasoning, and self-correction to ensure both performance and
reliability in high-stakes scientific applications. Code:

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LGK的视觉语言导航方法，通过引入外部知识库来增强常识推理能力，解决传统方法在复杂场景中指令与环境信息匹配不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言导航方法在复杂场景中缺乏常识推理能力，导致指令与环境信息匹配失败，需要引入外部知识来改善导航性能。

Method: 构建包含63万条语言描述的知识库，设计地标引导的知识机制(KGL)来聚焦相关知识，并提出知识引导的动态增强(KGDA)来整合语言、知识、视觉和历史信息。

Result: 在R2R和REVERIE数据集上的实验表明，LGK方法在导航误差、成功率和路径效率方面优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 通过引入外部知识库和地标引导机制，LGK方法有效提升了视觉语言导航的性能，特别是在复杂场景中的常识推理能力。

Abstract: Vision-and-language navigation is one of the core tasks in embodied
intelligence, requiring an agent to autonomously navigate in an unfamiliar
environment based on natural language instructions. However, existing methods
often fail to match instructions with environmental information in complex
scenarios, one reason being the lack of common-sense reasoning ability. This
paper proposes a vision-and-language navigation method called Landmark-Guided
Knowledge (LGK), which introduces an external knowledge base to assist
navigation, addressing the misjudgment issues caused by insufficient common
sense in traditional methods. Specifically, we first construct a knowledge base
containing 630,000 language descriptions and use knowledge Matching to align
environmental subviews with the knowledge base, extracting relevant descriptive
knowledge. Next, we design a Knowledge-Guided by Landmark (KGL) mechanism,
which guides the agent to focus on the most relevant parts of the knowledge by
leveraging landmark information in the instructions, thereby reducing the data
bias that may arise from incorporating external knowledge. Finally, we propose
Knowledge-Guided Dynamic Augmentation (KGDA), which effectively integrates
language, knowledge, vision, and historical information. Experimental results
demonstrate that the LGK method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods
on the R2R and REVERIE vision-and-language navigation datasets, particularly in
terms of navigation error, success rate, and path efficiency.

Motivation: 当前AI系统在高风险领域存在代理歧视、不公平性和可解释性问题，现有审计方法往往无法揭示不公平性的根源，特别是当偏见源于结构性偏差时。

Method: 利用形式溯因解释框架，结合背景知识识别不正当代理特征，引入能力概念作为与群体成员无关的任务相关属性，通过映射函数评估跨群体同等能力个体的公平性。

Result: 在德国信用数据集上的概念验证表明，该框架能够有效识别代理歧视并揭示结构性偏见，适用于现实世界案例。

Conclusion: 提出的溯因解释框架为理解AI决策中的代理歧视提供了有效工具，能够揭示结构性偏见的根源，促进更公平的AI系统开发。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems in high-stakes domains raise concerns
about proxy discrimination, unfairness, and explainability. Existing audits
often fail to reveal why unfairness arises, particularly when rooted in
structural bias. We propose a novel framework using formal abductive
explanations to explain proxy discrimination in individual AI decisions.
Leveraging background knowledge, our method identifies which features act as
unjustified proxies for protected attributes, revealing hidden structural
biases. Central to our approach is the concept of aptitude, a task-relevant
property independent of group membership, with a mapping function aligning
individuals of equivalent aptitude across groups to assess fairness
substantively. As a proof of concept, we showcase the framework with examples
taken from the German credit dataset, demonstrating its applicability in
real-world cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于整张图像的检索方法存在背景噪声干扰，视觉与文本线索对齐不足，容易产生幻觉问题，需要更精准的检索机制。

Method: 引入文本定位的目标检测，生成与问题最相关对象的边界框，进行针对性图像裁剪和聚焦检索，结合基于问题类型的去幻觉方法。

Result: VQA准确率从22.19%提升至25.64%，绝对提升3.45个百分点；幻觉率从65.79%降至13.88%，真实性得分提高。

Conclusion: 文本定位的RAG方法能有效提升VQA性能，通过聚焦检索减少噪声干扰，结合去幻觉策略显著降低幻觉现象。

Abstract: We propose a method to improve Visual Question Answering (VQA) with
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by introducing text-grounded object
localization. Rather than retrieving information based on the entire image, our
approach enables the model to generate a bounding box around the object most
relevant to the question, allowing for targeted image cropping and focused
retrieval. This reduces background noise, improves alignment between visual and
textual cues, and helps mitigate hallucinations. Our RAG method enhances
context-aware VQA responses increased the accuracy from 22.19% to 25.64%, with
an absolute increase of 3.45 percentage points, compared to the baseline
Llama-3.2-Vision-11B agent. We also proposed a de-hallucination method based on
question type which can effectively reduce the hallucination rate from 65.79%
to 13.88% and improves the truthfulness score.

TL;DR: SING-SQL是一个全自动的两阶段框架，用于为任何目标数据库生成高质量、高覆盖率的合成Text-to-SQL数据，无需SQL日志或人工标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决企业场景中Text-to-SQL系统需要针对单一数据库模式进行专业化，并能基于自有数据库评估系统性能的需求缺口。

Method: 采用分层分区数据库模式、多复杂度SQL查询合成、质量感知流水线（包括LLM作为评判员验证、可执行性检查、自动修复和列平衡）的两阶段框架。

Result: SingSQL-LM-3B-R64在BIRD基准子集上达到82.87% Soft F1和73.03% EX上限，在3B规模上比最佳基线提升+16.21 Soft F1和+12.36 EX。在合成评估集上大幅超越先前系统。

Conclusion: SING-SQL为构建和评估企业级Text-to-SQL系统提供了一个可扩展、数据库无关的范式，无模式微调与仅模式推理结合的策略效果最稳健。

Abstract: Translating natural language questions into SQL has become a core challenge
in enabling non-technical users to query databases. While recent work has
explored large-scale synthetic data generation to improve model performance
through post-training, most efforts emphasize cross-domain generalization. This
leaves a gap for real-world enterprise scenarios, where models need to
specialize to a single database schema and organizations require to be able to
evaluate their Text-to-SQL systems on their own databases. To address this, we
introduce SING-SQL, a fully automated two-stage framework for generating
high-quality, high-coverage synthetic Text-to-SQL data for any target database,
without relying on SQL logs or manual annotations. Our approach hierarchically
partitions a database schema into sub-schemas, synthesizes SQL queries across
multiple complexity levels, and applies a quality-aware pipeline that includes
LLM-as-a-judge validation, executability checks, automatic repair, and column
balancing. We further release SingSQL-LM, a family of compact language models
fine-tuned on the synthetic data, achieving strong in-domain generalization. On
the subset of the BIRD benchmark, SingSQL-LM-3B-R64 reaches 82.87% Soft F1 and
73.03% EX upper bound with 32 candidates, outperforming the best 3B-scale
baseline by +16.21 in Soft F1 and +12.36 in EX. At the 1.5B scale,
SingSQL-LM-1.5B-R64 improves over prior systems by +9.30 in Soft F1 and +4.49
in EX. On synthetic evaluation sets, SingSQL-LMs exceed prior systems by wide
margins, establishing state-of-the-art performance among open models at
comparable scales. Our study of context management strategies reveals that
schema-free fine-tuning combined with schema-only inference provides the most
robust results. These findings establish SING-SQL as a scalable,
database-agnostic paradigm for producing and evaluating enterprise-grade
Text-to-SQL systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决超大型MoE模型在资源受限的边缘平台上部署困难的问题，传统剪枝或量化方法难以在保持精度的同时实现超高压缩比。

Method: 采用协作压缩框架，结合专家剪枝、混合精度量化和激活优化技术，针对MoE架构特点进行优化压缩。

Result: 成功将DeepSeek-V3模型从1.3TB压缩到103GB，在128GB内存限制的平台上实现部署，精度优于传统均匀低比特量化方法。

Conclusion: 该协作压缩框架有效解决了超大型MoE模型在边缘平台的部署挑战，为资源受限环境下的模型压缩提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture is an important method for scaling
Large Language Models (LLMs). It increases model capacity while keeping
computation cost low. However, the ultra-large MoE models still have hundreds
of billions of parameters, requiring massive memory/storage and leading to
difficulties for deployment on resource-constrained edge platforms. Pruning or
quantization alone can hardly address the issue, because of the
super-aggressive compression ratio with significantly degraded accuracy and
output quality. To facilitate the deployment of ultra-large MoEs on edge
platforms, we propose a collaborative compression framework by combining expert
pruning, mixed-precision quantization, and activation optimization. It can
effectively reduce the storage footprint of the ultra-large MoE DeepSeek-V3
from 1.3TB to 103GB, while preserving high output quality with better accuracy
than traditional uniform low-bit quantization methods. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to deploy a compressed model from the ultra-large
DeepSeek-V3 on the platform with a strict 128GB total memory limit. Our
comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks under various memory
constraints demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with smaller model
sizes and higher accuracy than uniform low-bit quantization methods.

Conclusion: TimeRewarder能够利用真实世界的人类视频进行预训练，展示了从多样化视频源获取丰富奖励信号的可扩展方法潜力。

Abstract: Designing dense rewards is crucial for reinforcement learning (RL), yet in
robotics it often demands extensive manual effort and lacks scalability. One
promising solution is to view task progress as a dense reward signal, as it
quantifies the degree to which actions advance the system toward task
completion over time. We present TimeRewarder, a simple yet effective reward
learning method that derives progress estimation signals from passive videos,
including robot demonstrations and human videos, by modeling temporal distances
between frame pairs. We then demonstrate how TimeRewarder can supply step-wise
proxy rewards to guide reinforcement learning. In our comprehensive experiments
on ten challenging Meta-World tasks, we show that TimeRewarder dramatically
improves RL for sparse-reward tasks, achieving nearly perfect success in 9/10
tasks with only 200,000 interactions per task with the environment. This
approach outperformed previous methods and even the manually designed
environment dense reward on both the final success rate and sample efficiency.
Moreover, we show that TimeRewarder pretraining can exploit real-world human
videos, highlighting its potential as a scalable approach path to rich reward
signals from diverse video sources.

Abstract: Navigating heterogeneous traffic environments with diverse driving styles
poses a significant challenge for autonomous vehicles (AVs) due to their
inherent complexity and dynamic interactions. This paper addresses this
challenge by proposing a heterogeneous graph reinforcement learning (GRL)
framework enhanced with an expert system to improve AV decision-making
performance. Initially, a heterogeneous graph representation is introduced to
capture the intricate interactions among vehicles. Then, a heterogeneous graph
neural network with an expert model (HGNN-EM) is proposed to effectively encode
diverse vehicle features and produce driving instructions informed by
domain-specific knowledge. Moreover, the double deep Q-learning (DDQN)
algorithm is utilized to train the decision-making model. A case study on a
typical four-way intersection, involving various driving styles of human
vehicles (HVs), demonstrates that the proposed method has superior performance
over several baselines regarding safety, efficiency, stability, and convergence
rate, all while maintaining favorable real-time performance.

Method: NePTune通过混合执行模型，将自然语言查询动态翻译为可执行的Python程序，这些程序结合了命令式控制流和能够处理VLM生成不确定性的软逻辑运算符。采用模块化设计，将感知与推理解耦，支持无训练操作，同时其可微分操作支持微调。

Result: 在多个视觉推理基准测试和各种领域中使用对抗性测试进行评估，NePTune相比强大的基础模型表现出显著改进，并在新环境中展现出有效的组合泛化和适应能力。

Conclusion: NePTune框架成功克服了现有神经符号方法的局限性，通过集成感知和符号推理能力，显著提升了视觉语言模型的组合推理性能。

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in
various tasks, yet they often struggle with compositional reasoning, the
ability to decompose and recombine concepts to solve novel problems. While
neuro-symbolic approaches offer a promising direction, they are typically
constrained by crisp logical execution or predefined predicates, which limit
flexibility. In this work, we introduce NePTune, a neuro-symbolic framework
that overcomes these limitations through a hybrid execution model that
integrates the perception capabilities of foundation vision models with the
compositional expressiveness of symbolic reasoning. NePTune dynamically
translates natural language queries into executable Python programs that blend
imperative control flow with soft logic operators capable of reasoning over
VLM-generated uncertainty. Operating in a training-free manner, NePTune, with a
modular design, decouples perception from reasoning, yet its differentiable
operations support fine-tuning. We evaluate NePTune on multiple visual
reasoning benchmarks and various domains, utilizing adversarial tests, and
demonstrate a significant improvement over strong base models, as well as its
effective compositional generalization and adaptation capabilities in novel
environments.

### [446] [Thinking Sparks!: Emergent Attention Heads in Reasoning Models During Post Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25758)
*Yein Park,Minbyul Jeong,Jaewoo Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文通过电路分析揭示了后训练技术在大型推理模型中催生新型功能专门化注意力头的机制，不同训练方式（蒸馏/SFT vs 强化学习）产生不同的头演化模式，并发现了复杂推理与基础计算之间的性能权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解后训练技术（如监督微调和强化学习）如何从架构层面改善大型推理模型的能力，这些改进背后的机制目前仍不明确。

Method: 使用电路分析方法，比较Qwen系列和DeepSeek蒸馏模型，分析不同训练方式下注意力头的演化模式，包括蒸馏/SFT的累积稳定模式和强化学习的动态搜索模式。

Result: 发现后训练催生了功能专门化的推理头，不同训练方式产生不同的头演化模式；可控思考模型没有专门的思考头，关闭显式推理会激活更广泛但效率较低的补偿头；存在性能权衡：强化头能解决复杂问题但可能导致简单任务上的过度思考失败。

Conclusion: 复杂推理能力的获得以基础计算可靠性为代价，揭示了电路级动态与宏观性能之间的内在张力，为未来训练策略设计提供了重要启示：需要在发展有效推理策略与确保可靠执行之间取得平衡。

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of modern large reasoning models are largely
unlocked through post-training techniques such as supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning. However, the architectural mechanisms behind such
improvements remain largely opaque. In this work, we use circuit analysis to
demonstrate that post-training for complex reasoning sparks the emergence of
novel, functionally specialized attention heads. These heads collectively
support structured reasoning and computation. Our comparative analysis across
Qwen families and DeepSeek-distilled model reveals that these emergent heads
evolve differently under different training regimes. Distillation and SFT
foster a cumulative addition of stable reasoning heads. In contrast, group
relative policy optimization operates in a dynamic search mode: relatively few
attention heads are iteratively activated, evaluated, and pruned, with their
survival closely tracking fluctuations in the task reward signal. Furthermore,
we find that controllable think on/off models do not possess dedicated thinking
heads. Instead, turning off explicit reasoning triggers a broader-but less
efficient-set of compensatory heads. Through ablation and qualitative analyses,
we connect these circuit-level dynamics to a crucial performance trade-off:
strengthened heads enable sophisticated problem-solving strategies for
difficult problems but can also introduce over-thinking failure modes, such as
calculation errors or logical loops on simpler tasks. These findings connect
circuit-level dynamics to macro-level performance, identifying an inherent
tension where complex reasoning comes at the cost of elementary computations.
More broadly, our work points to future directions for training policy design,
emphasizing the need to balance the development of effective reasoning
strategies with the assurance of reliable, flawless execution.

*Matt Keon,Aabid Karim,Bhoomika Lohana,Abdul Karim,Thai Nguyen,Tara Hamilton,Ali Abbas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs在创意任务中倾向于回归平庸，缺乏真正的原创性。通过广告创意测试发现，模型偏好高概率信息，简化输入后无法恢复原始创意的深度和独特性。提供特定线索可以部分改善，但输出仍依赖常见套路。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在创意任务中的表现，评估其是否倾向于使用安全、通用的表达，而非真正的创造性内容。

Method: 使用广告概念作为创意压力测试，逐步简化广告创意，观察创意特征的消失顺序，并要求模型从简化输入重新生成，结合定量比较和定性分析。

Result: 简化过程中，隐喻、情感和视觉线索等创意特征早期消失，而事实内容保留。重新生成的文本虽然词汇多样但缺乏深度和独特性。提供特定线索可改善风格平衡，但输出仍依赖常见套路。

Conclusion: 无针对性指导时，LLMs在创意任务中倾向于平庸；结构化信号可以部分抵消这种趋势，为开发创意敏感模型指明方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) generate fluent text yet often default to safe,
generic phrasing, raising doubts about their ability to handle creativity. We
formalize this tendency as a Galton-style regression to the mean in language
and evaluate it using a creativity stress test in advertising concepts. When ad
ideas were simplified step by step, creative features such as metaphors,
emotions, and visual cues disappeared early, while factual content remained,
showing that models favor high-probability information. When asked to
regenerate from simplified inputs, models produced longer outputs with lexical
variety but failed to recover the depth and distinctiveness of the originals.
We combined quantitative comparisons with qualitative analysis, which revealed
that the regenerated texts often appeared novel but lacked true originality.
Providing ad-specific cues such as metaphors, emotional hooks and visual
markers improved alignment and stylistic balance, though outputs still relied
on familiar tropes. Taken together, the findings show that without targeted
guidance, LLMs drift towards mediocrity in creative tasks; structured signals
can partially counter this tendency and point towards pathways for developing
creativity-sensitive models.

*Siyu Zhu,Yanbin Jiang,Hejian Sang,Shao Tang,Qingquan Song,Biao He,Rohit Jain,Zhipeng Wang,Alborz Geramifard*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 在TravelPlanner基准测试中，Planner-R1方法仅用180个训练查询就达到了56.9%的最终通过率，比GPT-5基线提高了2.7倍，是公开排行榜上最强的智能体结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在智能体强化学习中的表现，探索不同规模模型对奖励塑造的响应能力，以及如何在保持泛化能力的同时实现计算效率。

Method: 使用Planner-R1方法进行智能体强化学习，重点研究奖励塑造技术，包括密集过程级信号的使用，比较8B和32B模型在不同奖励设置下的表现。

Result: 8B模型对奖励塑造高度敏感，在密集过程级信号下达到竞争性性能，计算效率比32B模型高3.5倍，内存效率高1.5倍。大模型在稀疏奖励下更稳健但增益较小。经过微调的模型在域外任务上保持或超过基线性能。

Conclusion: 奖励塑造是扩展智能体强化学习的关键杠杆，小模型在奖励塑造下具有竞争优势，可以在不牺牲泛化能力的情况下实现效率提升。

Abstract: We investigated Agentic RL with large language models on the
\textsc{TravelPlanner} benchmark. Our approach, \textsc{Planner-R1}, achieved a
\textbf{56.9\%} final-pass rate with only 180 training queries, a $2.7\times$
improvement over GPT-5's $21.2\%$ baseline and the strongest agentic result on
the public leaderboard. A central finding was that smaller models (8B) were
highly responsive to reward shaping: with dense process-level signals, they
reached competitive performance while being $3.5\times$ more compute-efficient
and $1.5\times$ more memory-efficient than 32B models. Larger models were more
robust under sparse rewards but exhibited smaller relative gains from shaping
and higher variance across runs. While curriculum learning offered no
significant benefit, shaped rewards consistently amplified learning dynamics,
making 8B models the most efficient setting for agentic RL. Crucially, these
gains did not come at the cost of overfitting: fine-tuned models mostly
maintained or exceeded baseline performance on out-of-domain tasks, including
\textsc{Multi-IF}, \textsc{NaturalPlan}, and $\tau$-\textsc{Bench}. These
results establish reward shaping as a decisive lever for scaling agentic RL,
highlight the competitive strength of smaller models, and demonstrate that
efficiency can be achieved without sacrificing generalization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PureVQ-GAN是一种针对数据投毒攻击的防御方法，通过向量量化VAE和GAN判别器的离散瓶颈机制破坏后门触发器模式，同时保持语义内容完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的防御方法需要数百次迭代优化步骤，计算成本高昂，难以在实际训练流程中应用。需要开发更高效的防御机制来对抗数据投毒攻击。

Method: 使用向量量化VAE（VQ-VAE）和GAN判别器的组合，通过学习的码本对中毒图像进行量化，破坏细粒度触发器模式，同时GAN判别器确保输出符合自然图像分布。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，对Gradient Matching和Bullseye Polytope攻击实现0%中毒成功率，对Narcissus攻击为1.64%，同时保持91-95%的干净准确率，比基于扩散的防御快50倍以上。

Conclusion: PureVQ-GAN提供了一种高效实用的数据投毒防御方案，通过离散量化机制有效破坏后门触发器，同时保持模型性能，适合实际训练流程部署。

Abstract: We introduce PureVQ-GAN, a defense against data poisoning that forces
backdoor triggers through a discrete bottleneck using Vector-Quantized VAE with
GAN discriminator. By quantizing poisoned images through a learned codebook,
PureVQ-GAN destroys fine-grained trigger patterns while preserving semantic
content. A GAN discriminator ensures outputs match the natural image
distribution, preventing reconstruction of out-of-distribution perturbations.
On CIFAR-10, PureVQ-GAN achieves 0% poison success rate (PSR) against Gradient
Matching and Bullseye Polytope attacks, and 1.64% against Narcissus while
maintaining 91-95% clean accuracy. Unlike diffusion-based defenses requiring
hundreds of iterative refinement steps, PureVQ-GAN is over 50x faster, making
it practical for real training pipelines.

### [451] [Chain-in-Tree: Back to Sequential Reasoning in LLM Tree Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25835)
*Xinzhe Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Chain-in-Tree (CiT)是一个插件框架，通过在树搜索中自适应地决定何时分支而不是每一步都分支，显著提高了大型语言模型在长程推理任务中的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于树搜索的方法在长程推理任务中虽然性能优异，但计算效率极低，通常比简单迭代方法慢一个数量级。

Method: CiT使用轻量级的分支必要性评估方法：BN-DP（直接提示辅助LLM判断是否需要分支）和BN-SC（通过聚类候选动作来估计一致性），并将其集成到三种代表性的LLM树搜索框架中。

Result: BN-DP在所有设置中一致减少75-85%的token生成、模型调用和运行时间，准确率损失可忽略甚至有时提升；BN-SC通常节省高达80%但存在不稳定性。

Conclusion: CiT框架显著提高了树搜索方法的效率，辅助LLM的质量对性能至关重要，BN-SC在确定性动作空间中无需LLM即可实现聚类。

Abstract: Test-time scaling enables large language models (LLMs) to improve performance
on long-horizon reasoning tasks by allocating additional compute at inference.
Tree-search-based approaches achieve state-of-the-art results in this setting,
but they are notoriously inefficient, often an order of magnitude slower than
simpler iterative methods. We introduce Chain-in-Tree (CiT), a plug-in
framework that adaptively decides when to branch during search rather than
branching at every step. CiT relies on lightweight Branching Necessity (BN)
evaluation methods: BN-DP (Direct Prompting), where an auxiliary LLM directly
judges whether a step requires branching, and BN-SC (Self-Consistency), which
clusters multiple candidate actions to estimate agreement. We integrate CiT
into three representative LLM-in-the-loop tree search frameworks: Tree of
Thoughts (ToT-BS), ReST-MCTS, and RAP, and evaluate across GSM8K and Math500.
Our results show that: (1) BN-DP consistently reduces token generation, model
invocations, and runtime by 75-85 percent across all settings, with negligible
accuracy loss and sometimes accuracy gains; (2) BN-SC typically yields
substantial savings (up to 80 percent) but shows instability in 1-4 out of 14
settings, caused by a small subset of examples that produce very long reasoning
steps; (3) the quality of auxiliary LLMs is critical, not only the BN evaluator
in BN-DP, but also the models used in BN-SC for clustering and equivalence
checking. When these roles are filled by smaller LLMs, performance degrades.
Importantly, BN-SC does not require LLMs in domains with deterministic action
spaces, where clustering can be done programmatically. We also provide a
theoretical guarantee that BN-DP never increases LLM invocations relative to
the baseline and release a unified implementation of CiT across ToT-BS,
ReST-MCTS, and RAP to facilitate reproducibility and extension.

*Ziyu Zhang,Hanzhao Li,Jingbin Hu,Wenhao Li,Lei Xie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出HiStyle，一种基于文本提示的分层风格嵌入预测方法，通过两阶段预测和对比学习提升可控语音合成的风格控制能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可控语音合成系统从标签控制转向自然语言描述控制，但直接预测风格嵌入忽略了嵌入分布的层次结构，限制了系统的潜力。

Method: 使用t-SNE分析可视化风格嵌入分布，发现层次聚类模式；提出HiStyle两阶段风格嵌入预测器，结合对比学习对齐文本和音频嵌入空间；设计结合统计方法和人类听觉偏好的风格标注策略。

Result: 实验表明HiStyle在保持语音自然度和可懂度的同时，相比其他方法实现了显著更好的风格可控性。

Conclusion: HiStyle通过分层预测风格嵌入和对比学习，有效提升了基于文本提示的可控语音合成系统的性能。

Abstract: Controllable speech synthesis refers to the precise control of speaking style
by manipulating specific prosodic and paralinguistic attributes, such as
gender, volume, speech rate, pitch, and pitch fluctuation. With the integration
of advanced generative models, particularly large language models (LLMs) and
diffusion models, controllable text-to-speech (TTS) systems have increasingly
transitioned from label-based control to natural language description-based
control, which is typically implemented by predicting global style embeddings
from textual prompts. However, this straightforward prediction overlooks the
underlying distribution of the style embeddings, which may hinder the full
potential of controllable TTS systems. In this study, we use t-SNE analysis to
visualize and analyze the global style embedding distribution of various
mainstream TTS systems, revealing a clear hierarchical clustering pattern:
embeddings first cluster by timbre and subsequently subdivide into finer
clusters based on style attributes. Based on this observation, we propose
HiStyle, a two-stage style embedding predictor that hierarchically predicts
style embeddings conditioned on textual prompts, and further incorporate
contrastive learning to help align the text and audio embedding spaces.
Additionally, we propose a style annotation strategy that leverages the
complementary strengths of statistical methodologies and human auditory
preferences to generate more accurate and perceptually consistent textual
prompts for style control. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that when
applied to the base TTS model, HiStyle achieves significantly better style
controllability than alternative style embedding predicting approaches while
preserving high speech quality in terms of naturalness and intelligibility.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了ASGuard框架，通过机制分析识别与时态劫持攻击相关的注意力头，训练缩放向量重新校准激活，并通过预防性微调增强模型的安全拒绝机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然经过安全对齐，但存在脆弱的拒绝行为，简单的语言变化（如时态改变）就能绕过其安全机制，这揭示了当前对齐方法的泛化差距。

Method: 使用电路分析识别与时态劫持攻击相关的注意力头，训练通道级缩放向量重新校准这些头的激活，然后进行预防性微调以学习更鲁棒的拒绝机制。

Result: 在三个LLM上，ASGuard有效降低了目标劫持攻击的成功率，同时保持了通用能力并最小化了过度拒绝，实现了安全性和实用性的帕累托最优平衡。

Conclusion: 研究展示了如何利用对模型内部机制的深入理解来开发实用、高效和有针对性的方法调整模型行为，为更可靠和可解释的AI安全指明了方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite being safety-aligned, exhibit brittle
refusal behaviors that can be circumvented by simple linguistic changes. As
tense jailbreaking demonstrates that models refusing harmful requests often
comply when rephrased in past tense, a critical generalization gap is revealed
in current alignment methods whose underlying mechanisms are poorly understood.
In this work, we introduce Activation-Scaling Guard (ASGuard), an insightful,
mechanistically-informed framework that surgically mitigates this specific
vulnerability. For the first step, we use circuit analysis to identify the
specific attention heads causally linked to the targeted jailbreaking, the
tense-changing attack. Second, we train a precise, channel-wise scaling vector
to recalibrate the activation of tense vulnerable heads. Lastly, we apply it
into a "preventative fine-tuning", forcing the model to learn a more robust
refusal mechanism. Across three LLMs, ASGuard effectively reduces the attack
success rate of targeted jailbreaking while preserving general capabilities and
minimizing over refusal, achieving a Pareto-optimal balance between safety and
utility. Our findings underscore how adversarial suffixes suppress the
propagation of the refusal-mediating direction, based on mechanistic analysis.
Furthermore, our work showcases how a deep understanding of model internals can
be leveraged to develop practical, efficient, and targeted methods for
adjusting model behavior, charting a course for more reliable and interpretable
AI safety.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Lita (Lite Agent) 是一个轻量级代码代理框架，通过最小化手动设计来评估LLMs的真实编程能力，在多个基准测试中表现优于复杂代理设计，且消耗更少token。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代码代理设计过于依赖复杂的手工工作流程和工具集，导致性能过度依赖提示调优、掩盖模型真实能力、构建维护成本高，且存在数据泄露风险。

Method: 引入Lita框架，操作化"轻量"原则，在保留完全自主代理基本要素的同时最小化手动设计，实现更忠实和统一的评估。

Result: 在Aider Polyglot和SWE-Bench测试中，Lita相比基于工作流程的代理基线实现了竞争性或更优性能，同时消耗更少token且设计工作量显著减少。

Conclusion: Lita足以揭示现代LLMs的底层编程能力，并提出代理复杂度定律：随着核心模型改进，不同复杂度代理间的性能差距将缩小至可忽略程度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to programming
tasks, ranging from single-turn code completion to autonomous agents. Current
code agent designs frequently depend on complex, hand-crafted workflows and
tool sets. However, this reliance on elaborate scaffolding presents several
challenges: agent performance becomes overly dependent on prompt tuning and
custom design choices, heavy human intervention obscures a model's true
underlying capabilities, and intricate pipelines are costly to build and
maintain. Furthermore, optimizing complex task prompts increases the risk of
data leakage. Currently, when introducing new models, LLM providers like OpenAI
and Anthropic often publish benchmark scores to demonstrate their models'
coding proficiency, but keep their proprietary evaluation frameworks
confidential. To address these limitations, we introduce Lita (Lite Agent),
which operationalizes liteness, a principle of minimizing manual design while
retaining the essential elements of a fully autonomous agent. Lita enables a
more faithful and unified evaluation without elaborate scaffolding. Experiments
on the Aider Polyglot and SWE-Bench with frontier models demonstrate that Lita
achieves competitive or superior performance compared to workflow-based and
agentic baselines. Crucially, Lita also consumes fewer tokens and requires
significantly less design effort. Our results suggest that Lita is sufficient
to reveal the underlying coding competence of modern LLMs. Finally, we propose
the Agent Complexity Law: the performance gap between agents of varying
complexity, from simple to sophisticated designs, will shrink as the core model
improves, ultimately converging to a negligible difference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 具身代理继承了LLMs的高级规划能力，但与物理世界的直接交互使其面临安全漏洞，需要在多个推理阶段识别和防范潜在危险。

Method: 识别四个关键推理阶段的安全风险，形式化三种安全约束类型，构建多模态基准测试SafeMindBench，并提出SafeMindAgent架构，采用Planner-Executor设计并集成三个级联安全模块。

Result: 实验表明主流LLMs和具身代理仍易发生安全关键故障，而SafeMindAgent在保持任务完成率的同时显著提高了安全率。

Conclusion: SafeMindBench和SafeMindAgent为具身LLM代理的安全风险提供了系统的评估套件和实用解决方案，推动了该领域的安全研究和缓解措施。

Abstract: Embodied agents powered by large language models (LLMs) inherit advanced
planning capabilities; however, their direct interaction with the physical
world exposes them to safety vulnerabilities. In this work, we identify four
key reasoning stages where hazards may arise: Task Understanding, Environment
Perception, High-Level Plan Generation, and Low-Level Action Generation. We
further formalize three orthogonal safety constraint types (Factual, Causal,
and Temporal) to systematically characterize potential safety violations.
Building on this risk model, we present SafeMindBench, a multimodal benchmark
with 5,558 samples spanning four task categories (Instr-Risk, Env-Risk,
Order-Fix, Req-Align) across high-risk scenarios such as sabotage, harm,
privacy, and illegal behavior. Extensive experiments on SafeMindBench reveal
that leading LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) and widely used embodied agents remain
susceptible to safety-critical failures. To address this challenge, we
introduce SafeMindAgent, a modular Planner-Executor architecture integrated
with three cascaded safety modules, which incorporate safety constraints into
the reasoning process. Results show that SafeMindAgent significantly improves
safety rate over strong baselines while maintaining comparable task completion.
Together, SafeMindBench and SafeMindAgent provide both a rigorous evaluation
suite and a practical solution that advance the systematic study and mitigation
of safety risks in embodied LLM agents.

Motivation: 互联网信息密度低、冗余度高，多层嵌套JSON结构能有效压缩信息并保持语义关系。现有LLMs评估基准过于强调纯JSON生成，缺乏对数据理解和提取能力的评估，与实际网络数据挖掘任务相关性不足。

Method: 设计DeepJSONEval基准测试，包含2100个多领域实例，具有深度嵌套结构，并按难度分类。通过实验评估不同LLMs在处理复杂JSON结构时的性能差异。

Result: 实验显示不同LLMs在处理复杂嵌套JSON结构时存在显著性能差距，验证了该基准测试的有效性。

Conclusion: DeepJSONEval基准测试填补了现有评估体系的空白，能更好地评估LLMs在结构化JSON生成方面的实际能力，促进相关研究发展。

Abstract: The internet is saturated with low-density, high-redundancy information, such
as social media comments, repetitive news, and lengthy discussions, making it
difficult to extract valuable insights efficiently. Multi-layer nested JSON
structures provide an effective solution by compressing such information into
semantically rich, hierarchical representations, which organize data into
key-value pairs, arrays, and nested objects, preserving contextual
relationships and enabling efficient storage, retrieval, and semantic querying.
For instance, in news aggregation, a JSON object can nest an article's metadata
(title, author, date), content (text, multimedia), and multimedia information
(multimedia type, caption) hierarchically. Large Language Models (LLMs) play a
transformative role in web data mining by parsing unstructured text and
outputting structured results directly into complex JSON schemas. However,
current benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' JSON output capabilities overemphasize
pure JSON generation rather than assessing data comprehension and extraction
abilities, a limitation that lacks relevance to practical web data mining
tasks. To address this, we introduce DeepJSONEval, a novel benchmark featuring
2100 multi-domain instances with deep nested structures, categorized by
difficulty. Experiments show significant performance gaps among LLMs in
handling such complexity. Our benchmark and datasets are open-sourced to
advance research in structured JSON
generation.(https://github.com/GTS-AI-Infra-Lab-SotaS/DeepJSONEval).

time utilization for rescuers in such critical situations. They furthermore
serve to support health professionals during the treatment with useful
information and suggestions. To achieve such a goal, the KIRETT project serves
to provide treatment recommendations and situation detection, combined on a
wrist-worn wearable for rescue operations.This paper aims to present the
significant role of vital signs in the improvement of decision-making during
rescue operations and show their impact on health professionals and patients in
need.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在时间紧迫的急救场景中，传统的详细诊断和咨询不可行，需要快速可靠的医疗处理方案。

Method: 开发KIRETT可穿戴设备，结合AI技术进行实时生命体征监测和情况检测，为急救人员提供治疗建议。

Result: 通过14名参与者的两天评估，分析了急救操作人员在医疗救援中的实际需求。

Conclusion: KIRETT系统能够有效支持急救服务，提供基于患者数据的快速准确医疗处理建议。

Abstract: Healthcare and Medicine are under constant pressure to provide patient-driven
medical expertise to ensure a fast and accurate treatment of the patient. In
such scenarios, the diagnosis contains, the family history, long term medical
data and a detailed consultation with the patient. In time-critical
emergencies, such conversation and time-consuming elaboration are not possible.
Rescue services need to provide fast, reliable treatments for the patient in
need. With the help of modern technologies, like treatment recommendations,
real-time vitals-monitoring, and situation detection through artificial
intelligence (AI) a situation can be analyzed and supported in providing fast,
accurate patient-data-driven medical treatments. In KIRETT, a wearable device
is developed to support in such scenarios and presents a way to provide
treatment recommendation in rescue services. The objective of this paper is to
present the quantitative results of a two-day KIRETT evaluation (14
participants) to analyze the needs of rescue operators in healthcare.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究LLM在多项选择题中的推理质量，发现当问题对模型不可解时更容易产生虚假推理链。通过估计问题可解性并改进奖励模型和强化学习目标，能有效提高过程正确推理率和答案准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型推理质量不仅关注正确答案，还要关注生成有效中间步骤。在多项选择题场景下分析虚假推理链的产生机制，特别是当问题对模型不可解时的情况。

Method: 通过估计每个问题的可解性，识别出最有效的学习区间。改进结果监督奖励模型和强化学习，在目标函数中融入可解性因素，使用组相对优势方法。

Result: 在数学和多模态数据集上的实验表明，这些改进能持续提高过程正确推理率，在强化学习中还能提升答案准确率。

Conclusion: 可解性是减少推理链幻觉和提高CoT推理可靠性的关键因素。

Abstract: Reasoning quality in large language models depends not only on producing
correct answers but also on generating valid intermediate steps. We study this
through multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), which provides a controlled
setting with fixed answer options. Our analysis shows that when questions are
effectively unsolvable for a model, spurious chains of thought (CoTs) are more
likely to appear, leading to false positives. By estimating the solvability of
each question, we uncover an intermediate regime where learning is most
effective. Building on this insight, we adapt outcome-supervised reward models
and reinforcement learning with group-relative advantage to incorporate
solvability into their objectives. Across experiments on math and multimodal
datasets, these modifications consistently yield higher rates of
process-correct reasoning and, in reinforcement learning, improved answer
accuracy as well. Our results highlight solvability as a key factor for
reducing hallucinations and increasing reliability in CoT reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了NuRisk数据集，用于自动驾驶中的时空风险推理，包含2900个场景和110万个代理级样本。微调后的7B VLM模型将准确率提升至41%，延迟降低75%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于视觉语言模型的方法主要在静态图像中定位代理并提供定性判断，缺乏捕捉风险随时间演变的时空推理能力。

Method: 构建NuRisk VQA数据集，包含真实世界数据和模拟器中的安全关键场景，提供基于鸟瞰图的序列图像和定量代理级风险标注。对知名VLMs进行基准测试，并微调7B VLM模型。

Result: 知名VLMs在显式时空推理方面表现不佳，峰值准确率仅33%且延迟高。微调后的7B VLM模型准确率提升至41%，延迟降低75%。

Conclusion: 虽然取得了显著进展，但41%的准确率仍表明该任务的挑战性，NuRisk成为推进自动驾驶时空推理的关键基准。

Abstract: Understanding risk in autonomous driving requires not only perception and
prediction, but also high-level reasoning about agent behavior and context.
Current Vision Language Models (VLMs)-based methods primarily ground agents in
static images and provide qualitative judgments, lacking the spatio-temporal
reasoning needed to capture how risks evolve over time. To address this gap, we
propose NuRisk, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset
comprising 2,900 scenarios and 1.1 million agent-level samples, built on
real-world data from nuScenes and Waymo, supplemented with safety-critical
scenarios from the CommonRoad simulator. The dataset provides Bird-Eye-View
(BEV) based sequential images with quantitative, agent-level risk annotations,
enabling spatio-temporal reasoning. We benchmark well-known VLMs across
different prompting techniques and find that they fail to perform explicit
spatio-temporal reasoning, resulting in a peak accuracy of 33% at high latency.
To address these shortcomings, our fine-tuned 7B VLM agent improves accuracy to
41% and reduces latency by 75%, demonstrating explicit spatio-temporal
reasoning capabilities that proprietary models lacked. While this represents a
significant step forward, the modest accuracy underscores the profound
challenge of the task, establishing NuRisk as a critical benchmark for
advancing spatio-temporal reasoning in autonomous driving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化模型发现方法在捕捉细粒度细节与确保训练数据范围外的泛化能力之间难以平衡，同时需要合理的模型复杂度。

Method: 使用两个视觉语言模块：AnalyzerVLM自主规划执行多步骤分析来提议候选模型，EvaluatorVLM从定量和感知角度评估候选模型对局部细节的拟合度和整体趋势的泛化能力。

Result: 流水线能有效发现既能捕捉细节又具有强泛化能力的模型，消融研究表明多模态和多步骤推理对发现优质模型都至关重要。

Conclusion: 多模态多步骤的自动化模型发现流水线在平衡细节捕捉与泛化能力方面表现优异，为模型发现提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Automated model discovery is the process of automatically searching and
identifying the most appropriate model for a given dataset over a large
combinatorial search space. Existing approaches, however, often face challenges
in balancing the capture of fine-grained details with ensuring generalizability
beyond training data regimes with a reasonable model complexity. In this paper,
we present a multi-modal \& multi-step pipeline for effective automated model
discovery. Our approach leverages two vision-language-based modules (VLM),
AnalyzerVLM and EvaluatorVLM, for effective model proposal and evaluation in an
agentic way. AnalyzerVLM autonomously plans and executes multi-step analyses to
propose effective candidate models. EvaluatorVLM assesses the candidate models
both quantitatively and perceptually, regarding the fitness for local details
and the generalibility for overall trends. Our results demonstrate that our
pipeline effectively discovers models that capture fine details and ensure
strong generalizability. Additionally, extensive ablation studies show that
both multi-modality and multi-step reasoning play crucial roles in discovering
favorable models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出RoRecomp方法，通过策略性地重组训练数据来引导模型进行简洁推理，在保持性能的同时显著提升效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准RLVR训练导致推理过程冗长和探索轨迹低效，因为仅基于结果的奖励无法激励效率，且响应长度的高方差造成优化信号噪声

Method: RoRecomp将响应分为两类批次：优先级批次（结合短正确和长错误响应）提供简洁性梯度信号，补偿批次（使用回放缓冲区剩余响应）保持稳定性

Result: 在三个设置中实现显著效率提升：零RL训练推理长度减少27.7%，智能体RL中不必要工具调用减少46.8%且精度提升，思维压缩长度减少达52.5%

Conclusion: RoRecomp是一种即插即用方法，能有效引导模型进行简洁推理，在多种设置下实现效率大幅提升且性能影响最小

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has proven effective in
eliciting complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, standard
RLVR training often leads to excessively verbose processes (in reasoning tasks)
and inefficient exploration trajectories (in agentic settings), as outcome-only
rewards provide no incentive for efficiency and the high variance in response
length within relatively small rollout groups results in noisy optimization
signals. To address this, we propose Rollout Response Recomposition (RoRecomp),
a plug-and-play method that guides models toward concise reasoning by
strategically recomposing the training data. RoRecomp separates responses into
two distinct batch types: 1) priority batches, which combine short-correct and
long-incorrect responses selected from online batches to provide a clear
gradient signal for brevity, and 2) compensation batches, which utilize
remaining responses from a replay buffer to maintain stability and prevent
model collapse. To comprehensively evaluate effectiveness, we test RoRecomp
across three settings where results demonstrate substantial efficiency gains:
reducing reasoning length by 27.7% in zero RL training, reducing unnecessary
tool calls by 46.8% while improving accuracy in agentic RL, and achieving up to
52.5% length reduction in thinking compression, all with minimal performance
impact.

TL;DR: CURE是一个新的机器遗忘框架，通过验证模型输出是否泄露敏感信息并重写为安全响应来减少信息泄露，即使对于间接查询也有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在网页规模语料上训练的语言模型可能记忆并暴露敏感信息，需要有效的机器遗忘方法。现有方法主要关注抑制敏感输出，但往往无法消除底层知识且扩展性有限。

Method: CURE使用轻量级校正器来验证模型输出是否包含目标知识，并在检测到泄露时重写它们。通过检索相关的遗忘目标作为上下文参考，校正器可以在无需额外训练的情况下适应新的遗忘请求。

Result: 广泛评估表明，CURE显著减少了信息泄露，即使在先前方法失效的间接查询情况下也能保持响应质量和通用效用。

Conclusion: CURE在持续遗忘场景下表现出鲁棒性，使其适用于实际应用，为大规模机器遗忘提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Language models trained on web-scale corpora risk memorizing and exposing
sensitive information, prompting the need for effective machine unlearning.
Prior methods mainly focus on input queries to suppress sensitive outputs, yet
this often fails to eliminate the underlying knowledge and limits scalability.
To address this, we propose Corrective Unlearning with Retrieved Exclusions
(CURE), a novel unlearning framework that verifies model outputs for leakage
and revises them into safe responses. Specifically, CURE employs a lightweight
corrector that is applied to the original model to verify whether outputs
contain target knowledge and to rewrite them if any leakage is detected. To
efficiently handle large-scale unlearning requests, CURE retrieves unlearning
targets that are relevant to the initial response and provides them as
in-context references to the corrector for detection and conditional revision.
By leveraging this retrieval augmentation, the corrector can adapt to new
unlearning requests without additional training. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that CURE substantially reduces information leakage, even from
indirect queries where prior works fall short, while maintaining response
quality and general utility. Moreover, it demonstrates robustness under
continual unlearning scenarios, making it practical for real-world
applications.

TL;DR: 提出了统一的多模态假内容检测框架UMFDet，能够同时处理人工制作和AI生成的虚假内容，在OmniFake数据集上表现优于专用基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将人工制作的虚假信息和AI生成内容分开研究，导致模型只能处理单一类型的虚假内容，而现实场景中内容类型通常是未知的，限制了专用系统的有效性。

Method: 构建了包含12.7万样本的OmniFake数据集，提出了UMFDet框架，使用VLM骨干网络，结合类别感知的MoE适配器和归因链式思维机制来捕获类别特定的欺骗信号。

Result: UMFDet在两种虚假信息类型上都实现了稳健一致的性能，优于专用基线模型。

Conclusion: UMFDet为现实世界的多模态欺骗检测提供了一个实用的解决方案，能够统一处理不同类型的虚假内容。

Abstract: In recent years, detecting fake multimodal content on social media has drawn
increasing attention. Two major forms of deception dominate: human-crafted
misinformation (e.g., rumors and misleading posts) and AI-generated content
produced by image synthesis models or vision-language models (VLMs). Although
both share deceptive intent, they are typically studied in isolation. NLP
research focuses on human-written misinformation, while the CV community
targets AI-generated artifacts. As a result, existing models are often
specialized for only one type of fake content. In real-world scenarios,
however, the type of a multimodal post is usually unknown, limiting the
effectiveness of such specialized systems. To bridge this gap, we construct the
Omnibus Dataset for Multimodal News Deception (OmniFake), a comprehensive
benchmark of 127K samples that integrates human-curated misinformation from
existing resources with newly synthesized AI-generated examples. Based on this
dataset, we propose Unified Multimodal Fake Content Detection (UMFDet), a
framework designed to handle both forms of deception. UMFDet leverages a VLM
backbone augmented with a Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adapter to
capture category-specific cues, and an attribution chain-of-thought mechanism
that provides implicit reasoning guidance for locating salient deceptive
signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMFDet achieves robust and
consistent performance across both misinformation types, outperforming
specialized baselines and offering a practical solution for real-world
multimodal deception detection.

Motivation: 现有LLM与NAS结合的方法存在架构无效、计算效率低、性能不如传统NAS等关键限制，需要更有效的LLM-NAS集成方法。

Method: 两阶段NAS框架，使用导航器LLM指导搜索方向，生成器LLM合成高质量候选架构，协调器模块管理两者交互，结合LLM的固有知识和迭代反馈、历史轨迹。

Result: 在ImageNet和NAS-Bench-201上超越现有NAS方法和传统搜索算法，达到新的SOTA结果，并能持续提升多种两阶段NAS方法在各种搜索空间中的性能和效率。

Conclusion: CoLLM-NAS展示了优秀的泛化能力，能有效结合LLM知识和NAS过程，为自动化神经架构设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Neural Architecture
Search (NAS) has introduced new possibilities for automating the design of
neural architectures. However, most existing methods face critical limitations,
including architectural invalidity, computational inefficiency, and inferior
performance compared to traditional NAS. In this work, we present Collaborative
LLM-based NAS (CoLLM-NAS), a two-stage NAS framework with knowledge-guided
search driven by two complementary LLMs. Specifically, we propose a Navigator
LLM to guide search direction and a Generator LLM to synthesize high-quality
candidates, with a dedicated Coordinator module to manage their interaction.
CoLLM-NAS efficiently guides the search process by combining LLMs' inherent
knowledge of structured neural architectures with progressive knowledge from
iterative feedback and historical trajectory. Experimental results on ImageNet
and NAS-Bench-201 show that CoLLM-NAS surpasses existing NAS methods and
conventional search algorithms, achieving new state-of-the-art results.
Furthermore, CoLLM-NAS consistently enhances the performance and efficiency of
various two-stage NAS methods (e.g., OFA, SPOS, and AutoFormer) across diverse
search spaces (e.g., MobileNet, ShuffleNet, and AutoFormer), demonstrating its
excellent generalization.

TL;DR: 本文警告不要将大语言模型（LLMs）的输出误解为类似后验概率的证据，建议将其重新定位为在明确范围条件下的高容量模式匹配器，用于准预测插值，而非概率推断的替代品。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLMs在社会科学中日益被用作合成代理，从增强调查响应到驱动多代理模拟，其输出可能被误认为是来自连贯模型的类似后验概率的证据。然而，预测不等于概率主义，准确的点估计并不意味着校准的不确定性。

Method: 本文提出了一个实用的重新框架，将LLMs视为在明确范围条件下的高容量模式匹配器，用于准预测插值，而非概率推断的替代品。并引入了实践防护措施，如独立抽样、预注册的人类基线、可靠性感知验证和子组校准。

Result: 通过提出的框架和防护措施，研究人员可以在避免类别错误的同时，进行有用的原型设计和预测。

Conclusion: LLMs在社会科学中的应用需要谨慎解释其输出，应将其视为高容量模式匹配器而非概率推断工具，并采用适当的防护措施以确保研究的有效性和可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly used as synthetic agents
in social science, in applications ranging from augmenting survey responses to
powering multi-agent simulations. Because strong prediction plus conditioning
prompts, token log-probs, and repeated sampling mimic Bayesian workflows, their
outputs can be misinterpreted as posterior-like evidence from a coherent model.
However, prediction does not equate to probabilism, and accurate points do not
imply calibrated uncertainty. This paper outlines cautions that should be taken
when interpreting LLM outputs and proposes a pragmatic reframing for the social
sciences in which LLMs are used as high-capacity pattern matchers for
quasi-predictive interpolation under explicit scope conditions and not as
substitutes for probabilistic inference. Practical guardrails such as
independent draws, preregistered human baselines, reliability-aware validation,
and subgroup calibration, are introduced so that researchers may engage in
useful prototyping and forecasting while avoiding category errors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有静态基准无法应对AI风险和法规的动态变化，存在关键安全缺口，需要动态评估生态系统来确保高级AI的安全部署。

Method: 采用多代理框架，通过专门代理的协同管道自主处理非结构化政策文档，并包含自我进化评估循环，系统从评估结果中学习以制定更复杂和有针对性的测试用例。

Result: 实验显示SafeEvalAgent有效性显著，随着评估难度增加，模型安全性持续下降。例如GPT-5在欧盟AI法案上的安全率从72.50%降至36.36%。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了静态评估的局限性，凸显了该框架发现传统方法遗漏的深层漏洞的能力，强调了动态评估生态系统对确保AI安全部署的迫切需求。

Abstract: The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into high-stakes
domains necessitates reliable safety and compliance evaluation. However,
existing static benchmarks are ill-equipped to address the dynamic nature of AI
risks and evolving regulations, creating a critical safety gap. This paper
introduces a new paradigm of agentic safety evaluation, reframing evaluation as
a continuous and self-evolving process rather than a one-time audit. We then
propose a novel multi-agent framework SafeEvalAgent, which autonomously ingests
unstructured policy documents to generate and perpetually evolve a
comprehensive safety benchmark. SafeEvalAgent leverages a synergistic pipeline
of specialized agents and incorporates a Self-evolving Evaluation loop, where
the system learns from evaluation results to craft progressively more
sophisticated and targeted test cases. Our experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of SafeEvalAgent, showing a consistent decline in model safety as
the evaluation hardens. For instance, GPT-5's safety rate on the EU AI Act
drops from 72.50% to 36.36% over successive iterations. These findings reveal
the limitations of static assessments and highlight our framework's ability to
uncover deep vulnerabilities missed by traditional methods, underscoring the
urgent need for dynamic evaluation ecosystems to ensure the safe and
responsible deployment of advanced AI.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are increasingly used to represent biomedical
information in structured, interpretable formats. However, existing biomedical
KGs often focus narrowly on molecular interactions or adverse events,
overlooking the rich data found in drug leaflets. In this work, we present (1)
a hackable, end-to-end pipeline to create KGs from unstructured online content
using a web scraper and an LLM; and (2) a curated dataset, MEDAKA, generated by
applying this method to publicly available drug leaflets. The dataset captures
clinically relevant attributes such as side effects, warnings,
contraindications, ingredients, dosage guidelines, storage instructions and
physical characteristics. We evaluate it through manual inspection and with an
LLM-as-a-Judge framework, and compare its coverage with existing biomedical KGs
and databases. We expect MEDAKA to support tasks such as patient safety
monitoring and drug recommendation. The pipeline can also be used for
constructing KGs from unstructured texts in other domains. Code and dataset are

Motivation: 抑郁症是全球重大公共卫生挑战，早期识别至关重要。现有社交媒体抑郁检测方法存在准确率不足、时间序列特征利用不充分、标注成本高等问题。

Method: 1. 使用无监督LSTM自编码器提取用户推文的时间动态特征（如抑郁倾向演化模式）；2. 采用注意力机制动态加权关键文本（如早期抑郁信号），构建多示例学习架构提升用户级检测精度。

Result: 在专业医学标注的WU3D数据集上验证，模型在准确率、召回率和F1分数上显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 弱监督学习策略显著降低标注成本，为大规模社交媒体抑郁症筛查提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Depression is a major global public health challenge and its early
identification is crucial. Social media data provides a new perspective for
depression detection, but existing methods face limitations such as
insufficient accuracy, insufficient utilization of time series features, and
high annotation costs. To this end, this study proposes the LMILAtt model,
which innovatively integrates Long Short-Term Memory autoencoders and attention
mechanisms: firstly, the temporal dynamic features of user tweets (such as
depressive tendency evolution patterns) are extracted through unsupervised LSTM
autoencoders. Secondly, the attention mechanism is used to dynamically weight
key texts (such as early depression signals) and construct a multi-example
learning architecture to improve the accuracy of user-level detection. Finally,
the performance was verified on the WU3D dataset labeled by professional
medicine. Experiments show that the model is significantly better than the
baseline model in terms of accuracy, recall and F1 score. In addition, the
weakly supervised learning strategy significantly reduces the cost of labeling
and provides an efficient solution for large-scale social media depression
screening.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) integrated into agent-driven workflows hold
immense promise for healthcare, yet a significant gap exists between their
potential and practical implementation within clinical settings. To address
this, we present a practitioner-oriented field manual for deploying generative
agents that use electronic health record (EHR) data. This guide is informed by
our experience deploying the "irAE-Agent", an automated system to detect
immune-related adverse events from clinical notes at Mass General Brigham, and
by structured interviews with 20 clinicians, engineers, and informatics leaders
involved in the project. Our analysis reveals a critical misalignment in
clinical AI development: less than 20% of our effort was dedicated to prompt
engineering and model development, while over 80% was consumed by the
sociotechnical work of implementation. We distill this effort into five "heavy
lifts": data integration, model validation, ensuring economic value, managing
system drift, and governance. By providing actionable solutions for each of
these challenges, this field manual shifts the focus from algorithmic
development to the essential infrastructure and implementation work required to
bridge the "valley of death" and successfully translate generative AI from

Abstract: Developing 3D games requires specialized expertise across multiple domains,
including programming, 3D modeling, and engine configuration, which limits
access to millions of potential creators. Recently, researchers have begun to
explore automated game development. However, existing approaches face three
primary challenges: (1) limited scope to 2D content generation or isolated code
snippets; (2) requirement for manual integration of generated components into
game engines; and (3) poor performance on handling interactive game logic and
state management. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate
potential capabilities to ease the game generation task, a critical gap still
remains in translating these outputs into production-ready, executable game
projects based on game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine.
  To bridge the gap, this paper introduces UniGen, the first end-to-end
coordinated multi-agent framework that automates zero-coding development of
runnable 3D games from natural language requirements. Specifically, UniGen uses
a Planning Agent that interprets user requirements into structured blueprints
and engineered logic descriptions; after which a Generation Agent produces
executable C# scripts; then an Automation Agent handles engine-specific
component binding and scene construction; and lastly a Debugging Agent provides
real-time error correction through conversational interaction. We evaluated
UniGen on three distinct game prototypes. Results demonstrate that UniGen not
only democratizes game creation by requiring no coding from the user, but also
reduces development time by 91.4%. We release UniGen at
https://github.com/yxwan123/UniGen. A video demonstration is available at

*Eric J. W. Orlowski,Hakim Norhashim,Tristan Koh Ly Wey*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文主张将社会科学中的定性方法融入AI对齐实践，提出基于"厚描述"概念的"厚输出"理念，要求AI系统产生反映深层文化含义的输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI文化对齐方法过度依赖定量基准和简单代理，无法捕捉人类文化的细微差别和情境依赖性，需要更深入的文化理解方法。

Method: 借鉴Clifford Geertz的"厚描述"概念，提出"厚输出"框架，要求AI输出基于用户提供的语境和意图，反映深层文化含义。

Result: 提出文化对齐成功的三个必要条件：充分界定的文化表征、细致入微的输出能力、输出在提示隐含的文化语境中的锚定。

Conclusion: 呼吁跨学科合作和采用定性、民族志评估方法，开发真正具有文化敏感性、伦理责任感和反映人类复杂性的AI系统。

Abstract: While cultural alignment has increasingly become a focal point within AI
research, current approaches relying predominantly on quantitative benchmarks
and simplistic proxies fail to capture the deeply nuanced and context-dependent
nature of human cultures. Existing alignment practices typically reduce culture
to static demographic categories or superficial cultural facts, thereby
sidestepping critical questions about what it truly means to be culturally
aligned. This paper argues for a fundamental shift towards integrating
interpretive qualitative approaches drawn from social sciences into AI
alignment practices, specifically in the context of Large Language Models
(LLMs). Drawing inspiration from Clifford Geertz's concept of "thick
description," we propose that AI systems must produce outputs that reflect
deeper cultural meanings--what we term "thick outputs"-grounded firmly in
user-provided context and intent. We outline three necessary conditions for
successful cultural alignment: sufficiently scoped cultural representations,
the capacity for nuanced outputs, and the anchoring of outputs in the cultural
contexts implied within prompts. Finally, we call for cross-disciplinary
collaboration and the adoption of qualitative, ethnographic evaluation methods
as vital steps toward developing AI systems that are genuinely culturally
sensitive, ethically responsible, and reflective of human complexity.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型作为独立推理代理在材料科学知识发现中的应用潜力，特别是在没有明确指令的情况下自主探索和发现系统行为的能力。

Method: 利用LangGraph的工具功能为代理提供黑盒函数进行探索，通过试错和持久性策略进行知识发现，并在儿童游戏和原子层处理反应器模拟中验证方法。

Result: 证明了LLM代理能够自主探索、发现并利用化学相互作用，即使在探测能力有限的情况下也能有效进行知识发现，结果显示出强烈的路径依赖性。

Conclusion: LLM代理在材料科学知识发现中具有实际应用潜力，能够通过自主探索生成可推广的陈述，试错和持久性在知识发现过程中发挥关键作用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention for several
years now. Recently, their use as independently reasoning agents has been
proposed. In this work, we test the potential of such agents for knowledge
discovery in materials science. We repurpose LangGraph's tool functionality to
supply agents with a black box function to interrogate. In contrast to process
optimization or performing specific, user-defined tasks, knowledge discovery
consists of freely exploring the system, posing and verifying statements about
the behavior of this black box, with the sole objective of generating and
verifying generalizable statements. We provide proof of concept for this
approach through a children's parlor game, demonstrating the role of
trial-and-error and persistence in knowledge discovery, and the strong
path-dependence of results. We then apply the same strategy to show that LLM
agents can explore, discover, and exploit diverse chemical interactions in an
advanced Atomic Layer Processing reactor simulation using intentionally limited
probe capabilities without explicit instructions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于Gienapp效用维度框架的人类中心化问卷，用于评估RAG系统输出，通过多轮迭代精炼，结合人类和LLM反馈，重点关注用户意图、文本结构和信息可验证性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统在用户应用中广泛部署，但对其输出的系统性、以人为中心的评估仍然不足，需要开发更全面的评估工具。

Method: 基于Gienapp效用维度框架设计问卷，通过多轮查询-输出对的评分和语义讨论进行迭代精炼，结合人类评分者和人类-LLM对组的反馈。

Result: LLM能可靠关注指标描述和尺度标签，但在检测文本格式变化方面表现较弱；人类难以严格关注指标描述和标签；LLM评分和解释被视为有用支持，但数值评分与人类缺乏一致性。

Conclusion: 最终问卷扩展了初始框架，重点关注用户意图、文本结构和信息可验证性，为RAG系统的人类中心化评估提供了改进工具。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are increasingly deployed in
user-facing applications, yet systematic, human-centered evaluation of their
outputs remains underexplored. Building on Gienapp's utility-dimension
framework, we designed a human-centred questionnaire that assesses RAG outputs
across 12 dimensions. We iteratively refined the questionnaire through several
rounds of ratings on a set of query-output pairs and semantic discussions.
Ultimately, we incorporated feedback from both a human rater and a human-LLM
pair. Results indicate that while large language models (LLMs) reliably focus
on metric descriptions and scale labels, they exhibit weaknesses in detecting
textual format variations. Humans struggled to focus strictly on metric
descriptions and labels. LLM ratings and explanations were viewed as a helpful
support, but numeric LLM and human ratings lacked agreement. The final
questionnaire extends the initial framework by focusing on user intent, text
structuring, and information verifiability.

TL;DR: 提出DIVER框架，通过全局序列多样性激励深度探索，提升大语言模型在可验证奖励强化学习中的推理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在推理任务中因状态-动作空间巨大和奖励稀疏而面临探索不足和样本效率低的问题

Method: 引入全局多样性激励作为内在奖励，采用基于势能的奖励塑造机制保持最优策略不变性，设计简单启发式方法防止奖励黑客攻击

Result: DIVER在领域内和领域外任务上均优于竞争性RLVR基线，在Pass@1和Pass@k评估中表现优异

Conclusion: 全局序列多样性是激励深度探索和提升推理能力的关键因素

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
crucial paradigm for incentivizing reasoning capabilities in Large Language
Models (LLMs). Due to vast state-action spaces and reward sparsity in reasoning
tasks, existing methods often struggle with deficient exploration and poor
sample efficiency. In the paper, we propose \textbf{DIVER}
(\textbf{D}iversity-\textbf{I}ncentivized Exploration for
\textbf{V}ersatil\textbf{E} \textbf{R}easoning), an innovative framework that
highlights the pivotal role of global sequence-level diversity to incentivize
deep exploration for versatile reasoning. We first conduct a primary empirical
study to reveal a strong positive correlation between global diversity and
reasoning capacity. Building on this insight, we introduce global diversity
incentives as an intrinsic reward to promote deep exploration in a semantically
structured space. Incorporating the intrinsic reward, we develop a
potential-based reward shaping mechanism to preserve optimal policy invariance
and design simple heuristics to mitigate possible reward hacking. Experimental
results show that DIVER outperforms competitive RLVR baselines with various
exploration strategies on both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks, excelling in
both Pass@1 and Pass@k evaluations. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SlimPack是一个解决大语言模型分布式训练中上下文长度差异问题的框架，通过将样本分解为细粒度切片，采用非对称分区策略，在保持内存和通信效率的同时显著提升训练吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型分布式训练受到上下文长度极端差异的严重阻碍，这种数据异构性导致工作负载不平衡和硬件利用率低下，现有解决方案往往牺牲内存或通信效率。

Method: 将样本分解为细粒度切片，采用非对称分区策略为前向和后向传播分别优化调度单元，通过两阶段求解器和高保真模拟器实现全面平衡。

Result: 实验表明SlimPack相比基线方法实现了高达2.8倍的训练吞吐量提升，同时保持了优越的平衡性和高资源效率。

Conclusion: SlimPack通过重新思考数据打包和调度策略，从根本上解决了分布式训练中的工作负载不平衡问题，打破了传统权衡，实现了平衡性和效率的双重提升。

Abstract: The efficient distributed training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
severely hampered by the extreme variance in context lengths. This data
heterogeneity, amplified by conventional packing strategies and asymmetric
forward-backward costs, leads to critical inefficiencies such as cascading
workload imbalances and severe hardware underutilization. Existing solutions
attempt to mitigate these challenges, but often at the expense of memory or
communication efficiency.
  To address these challenges, we introduce SlimPack, a framework that
fundamentally rethinks data packing and scheduling by decomposing samples into
fine-grained slices. This slice-level decomposition immediately mitigates
critical memory and communication bottlenecks by transforming large, volatile
workloads into a stream of smaller, manageable units. This flexibility is then
harnessed for our core innovation, Asymmetric Partitioning, which assembles
balanced scheduling units uniquely optimized for the different demands of the
forward and backward passes. Orchestrated by a two-phase solver and a
high-fidelity simulator, SlimPack holistically resolves imbalances across all
parallel dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SlimPack achieves
up to a $2.8\times$ training throughput improvement over baselines, breaking
the conventional trade-off by delivering both superior balance and high
resource efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长时程具身规划中世界不仅通过智能体动作变化，还存在并发外生过程（如水温变化、多米诺骨牌连锁反应）的挑战。

Method: 联合学习符号状态表示和因果过程（内生动作+外生机制），每个因果过程建模随机因果效应关系的时间过程，使用变分贝叶斯推理结合LLM提议从有限数据中学习。

Result: 在五个模拟桌面机器人环境中，学习到的模型能够实现快速规划，并泛化到具有更多对象和更复杂目标的保留任务，优于一系列基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的抽象世界模型框架能够有效处理并发外生过程，实现长时程具身规划，并在复杂任务中展现出良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Long-horizon embodied planning is challenging because the world does not only
change through an agent's actions: exogenous processes (e.g., water heating,
dominoes cascading) unfold concurrently with the agent's actions. We propose a
framework for abstract world models that jointly learns (i) symbolic state
representations and (ii) causal processes for both endogenous actions and
exogenous mechanisms. Each causal process models the time course of a
stochastic causal-effect relation. We learn these world models from limited
data via variational Bayesian inference combined with LLM proposals. Across
five simulated tabletop robotics environments, the learned models enable fast
planning that generalizes to held-out tasks with more objects and more complex
goals, outperforming a range of baselines.

TL;DR: ILR是一个多智能体协同学习框架，通过动态交互和感知校准来增强LLMs的独立问题解决能力，在数学和编程基准测试中比单智能体学习提升高达5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在推理时需要重新执行多智能体系统，而人类认知表明个体可以通过互动提升推理能力并在未来独立解决问题。

Method: 使用动态交互（根据问题难度自适应选择合作/竞争策略，通过Idea3范式进行信息交换）和感知校准（GRPO训练方法整合奖励分布特征）。

Result: 在三个LLMs和五个数学基准、一个编程基准上的实验显示，ILR持续优于单智能体学习，比最强基线提升高达5%。

Conclusion: Idea3能增强强LLMs在多智能体推理中的鲁棒性，动态交互类型比纯合作或竞争策略更能促进多智能体学习。

Abstract: Existing multi-agent learning approaches have developed interactive training
environments to explicitly promote collaboration among multiple Large Language
Models (LLMs), thereby constructing stronger multi-agent systems (MAS).
However, during inference, they require re-executing the MAS to obtain final
solutions, which diverges from human cognition that individuals can enhance
their reasoning capabilities through interactions with others and resolve
questions independently in the future. To investigate whether multi-agent
interaction can enhance LLMs' independent problem-solving ability, we introduce
ILR, a novel co-learning framework for MAS that integrates two key components:
Dynamic Interaction and Perception Calibration. Specifically, Dynamic
Interaction first adaptively selects either cooperative or competitive
strategies depending on question difficulty and model ability. LLMs then
exchange information through Idea3 (Idea Sharing, Idea Analysis, and Idea
Fusion), an innovative interaction paradigm designed to mimic human discussion,
before deriving their respective final answers. In Perception Calibration, ILR
employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to train LLMs while
integrating one LLM's reward distribution characteristics into another's reward
function, thereby enhancing the cohesion of multi-agent interactions. We
validate ILR on three LLMs across two model families of varying scales,
evaluating performance on five mathematical benchmarks and one coding
benchmark. Experimental results show that ILR consistently outperforms
single-agent learning, yielding an improvement of up to 5% over the strongest
baseline. We further discover that Idea3 can enhance the robustness of stronger
LLMs during multi-agent inference, and dynamic interaction types can boost
multi-agent learning compared to pure cooperative or competitive strategies.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of LLMs sparked significant interest in their potential
to augment or automate managerial functions. One of the most recent trends in
AI benchmarking is performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) over longer time
horizons. While LLMs excel at tasks involving natural language and pattern
recognition, their capabilities in multi-step, strategic business
decision-making remain largely unexplored. Few studies demonstrated how results
can be different from benchmarks in short-term tasks, as Vending-Bench
revealed. Meanwhile, there is a shortage of alternative benchmarks for
long-term coherence. This research analyses a novel benchmark using a business
game for the decision making in business. The research contributes to the
recent literature on AI by proposing a reproducible, open-access management
simulator to the research community for LLM benchmarking. This novel framework
is used for evaluating the performance of five leading LLMs available in free
online interface: Gemini, ChatGPT, Meta AI, Mistral AI, and Grok. LLM makes
decisions for a simulated retail company. A dynamic, month-by-month management
simulation provides transparently in spreadsheet model as experimental
environment. In each of twelve months, the LLMs are provided with a structured
prompt containing a full business report from the previous period and are
tasked with making key strategic decisions: pricing, order size, marketing
budget, hiring, dismissal, loans, training expense, R&D expense, sales
forecast, income forecast The methodology is designed to compare the LLMs on
quantitative metrics: profit, revenue, and market share, and other KPIs. LLM
decisions are analyzed in their strategic coherence, adaptability to market
changes, and the rationale provided for their decisions. This approach allows
to move beyond simple performance metrics for assessment of the long-term
decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法存在高计算成本、泛化能力有限或无法检测复杂上下文中的恶意意图等问题，需要更高效和自适应的安全机制。

Method: 将安全评估分解为三个阶段：意图推断检测输入风险，自我反思评估生成响应并分配置信度，自我修订自适应重写不确定输出。

Result: 在五种代表性越狱攻击类型上显著提高了鲁棒性和适应性，优于七种最先进的防御基线方法。

Conclusion: SafeBehavior提供了一种高效且受人类启发的防御方法，能够有效保护LLM免受越狱攻击。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across
diverse natural language processing tasks, but their growing power also
amplifies potential risks such as jailbreak attacks that circumvent built-in
safety mechanisms. Existing defenses including input paraphrasing, multi step
evaluation, and safety expert models often suffer from high computational
costs, limited generalization, or rigid workflows that fail to detect subtle
malicious intent embedded in complex contexts. Inspired by cognitive science
findings on human decision making, we propose SafeBehavior, a novel
hierarchical jailbreak defense mechanism that simulates the adaptive multistage
reasoning process of humans. SafeBehavior decomposes safety evaluation into
three stages: intention inference to detect obvious input risks, self
introspection to assess generated responses and assign confidence based
judgments, and self revision to adaptively rewrite uncertain outputs while
preserving user intent and enforcing safety constraints. We extensively
evaluate SafeBehavior against five representative jailbreak attack types
including optimization based, contextual manipulation, and prompt based attacks
and compare it with seven state of the art defense baselines. Experimental
results show that SafeBehavior significantly improves robustness and
adaptability across diverse threat scenarios, offering an efficient and human
inspired approach to safeguarding LLMs against jailbreak attempts.

Method: 通过从真实世界视频中提取光流信号，构建反映日常时间动态的数据集，并基于此管道创建REAL-V-TSFM数据集。

Result: 在零样本预测任务中，三个最先进的时间序列基础模型在提出的数据集上普遍表现出性能下降，表明这些基础模型的泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 研究强调了以数据为中心的基准测试和多样化模型结构的紧迫性，同时验证了基于视频的时间序列数据提取管道的有效性。

Abstract: Recent evaluations of time-series foundation models (TSFMs) have emphasized
synthetic benchmarks, leaving real-world generalization less thoroughly
examined. This work proposes a novel benchmarking approach that bridges
synthetic and realistic data by extracting temporal signals from real-world
video using optical flow and curating datasets reflecting everyday temporal
dynamics. Building upon this pipeline, we introduce REAL-V-TSFM, a novel
dataset designed to capture rich and diverse time series derived from
real-world videos. Experimental results on three state-of-the-art of TSFMs
under zero-shot forecasting shows that, despite strong performance on
conventional benchmarks, these models predominantly exhibit performance
degradation on the proposed dataset, indicating limited generalizability in
these foundation models. These findings highlight the urgent need for
data-centric benchmarking and diverse model structure to advance TSFMs toward
genuine universality, while further validating the effectiveness of our
video-based time series data extraction pipeline.

Abstract: Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a new class of
self-evolving agents that autonomously improve through interaction with the
environment, demonstrating strong capabilities. However, self-evolution also
introduces novel risks overlooked by current safety research. In this work, we
study the case where an agent's self-evolution deviates in unintended ways,
leading to undesirable or even harmful outcomes. We refer to this as
Misevolution. To provide a systematic investigation, we evaluate misevolution
along four key evolutionary pathways: model, memory, tool, and workflow. Our
empirical findings reveal that misevolution is a widespread risk, affecting
agents built even on top-tier LLMs (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro). Different emergent
risks are observed in the self-evolutionary process, such as the degradation of
safety alignment after memory accumulation, or the unintended introduction of
vulnerabilities in tool creation and reuse. To our knowledge, this is the first
study to systematically conceptualize misevolution and provide empirical
evidence of its occurrence, highlighting an urgent need for new safety
paradigms for self-evolving agents. Finally, we discuss potential mitigation
strategies to inspire further research on building safer and more trustworthy
self-evolving agents. Our code and data are available at

Conclusion: MC-GNNAS-Dock通过多标准评估、架构优化和排名学习增强，实现了比单一最佳算法更优越且一致的分子对接性能。

Abstract: Molecular docking is a core tool in drug discovery for predicting
ligand-target interactions. Despite the availability of diverse search-based
and machine learning approaches, no single docking algorithm consistently
dominates, as performance varies by context. To overcome this challenge,
algorithm selection frameworks such as GNNAS-Dock, built on graph neural
networks, have been proposed. This study introduces an enhanced system,
MC-GNNAS-Dock, with three key advances. First, a multi-criteria evaluation
integrates binding-pose accuracy (RMSD) with validity checks from PoseBusters,
offering a more rigorous assessment. Second, architectural refinements by
inclusion of residual connections strengthen predictive robustness. Third,
rank-aware loss functions are incorporated to sharpen rank learning. Extensive
experiments are performed on a curated dataset containing approximately 3200
protein-ligand complexes from PDBBind. MC-GNNAS-Dock demonstrates consistently
superior performance, achieving up to 5.4% (3.4%) gains under composite
criteria of RMSD below 1\AA{} (2\AA{}) with PoseBuster-validity compared to the

Conclusion: FLoRA-NA有效解决了联邦低秩适应中的通信效率和泛化差距问题，在保持低通信成本的同时提升了全局性能

Abstract: With the rapid emergence of foundation models and the increasing need for
fine-tuning across distributed environments, Federated Low-Rank Adaptation
(FedLoRA) has recently gained significant attention. Despite enormous
potential, current FedLoRA methods face notable challenges due to inexact
updates. Existing approaches have attempted to mitigate this issue, but they
often introduce a \emph{local-global generalization gap} and incur
\emph{substantial communication overhead}, limiting their scalability and
effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{F}ederated
\textbf{Lo}w-\textbf{R}ank \textbf{A}ggregation with \textbf{N}early
\textbf{A}ccurate Estimation (FLoRA-NA). FLoRA-NA leverages the local LoRA
matrices on the server to estimate the aggregated matrices $\hat{A}$ and
$\hat{B}$, which are then distributed to clients for local updates. This
surrogated aggregated matrices minimizes the divergence between ideal $\nabla
\Bar{W} = \sum^{U}_{u=1}B_u A_u$ and practical updates $\nabla \hat{W} =
\hat{B}\hat{A}$ without adding communication cost beyond vanilla FedLoRA. By
doing so, FLoRA-NA achieves communication efficiency and bridges the gap
between local personalization and global generalization, addressing a key
limitation of prior personalized FedLoRA approaches. We conduct extensive
evaluations across diverse tasks, including natural language understanding,
mathematical reasoning, and code-solving ability using various foundation
models. Experimental results consistently demonstrate that FLoRA-NA achieves
state-of-the-art global performance while maintaining low communication
overhead.

*Hamed Babaei Giglou,Jennifer D'Souza,Sören Auer,Mahsa Sanaei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究重新探讨了知识图谱嵌入(KGE)模型在实体对齐任务中的潜力，将其重新定义为合并本体上的链接预测问题，开发了支持17种KGE模型的模块化框架，并在多个领域数据集上验证了其高精度性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型语言模型在捕捉上下文语义方面取得进展，但知识图谱嵌入模型在实体对齐任务中的潜力尚未充分挖掘。KGE模型提供可扩展、结构感知的表征，特别适合基于本体的任务，但在实体对齐中应用不足。

Method: 将实体对齐重新定义为合并本体上的链接预测问题，开发集成到OntoAligner库中的模块化框架，支持17种不同的KGE模型，通过组合本体学习嵌入表示，并计算实体表示间的余弦相似度进行对齐。

Result: 在7个基准数据集上的评估显示：ConvE和TransF等KGE模型产生高精度对齐结果，在结构丰富和多关系领域优于传统系统；虽然召回率适中，但这种保守性使其适合需要高置信度映射的场景。

Conclusion: KGE模型直接保持和利用本体结构，与擅长上下文推理的LLM方法形成互补，提供计算高效的策略，凸显了基于嵌入的实体对齐的前景，并为混合模型和自适应策略的进一步研究开辟了途径。

Abstract: Ontology Alignment (OA) is essential for enabling semantic interoperability
across heterogeneous knowledge systems. While recent advances have focused on
large language models (LLMs) for capturing contextual semantics, this work
revisits the underexplored potential of Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models,
which offer scalable, structure-aware representations well-suited to
ontology-based tasks. Despite their effectiveness in link prediction, KGE
methods remain underutilized in OA, with most prior work focusing narrowly on a
few models. To address this gap, we reformulate OA as a link prediction problem
over merged ontologies represented as RDF-style triples and develop a modular
framework, integrated into the OntoAligner library, that supports 17 diverse
KGE models. The system learns embeddings from a combined ontology and aligns
entities by computing cosine similarity between their representations. We
evaluate our approach using standard metrics across seven benchmark datasets
spanning five domains: Anatomy, Biodiversity, Circular Economy, Material
Science and Engineering, and Biomedical Machine Learning. Two key findings
emerge: first, KGE models like ConvE and TransF consistently produce
high-precision alignments, outperforming traditional systems in structure-rich
and multi-relational domains; second, while their recall is moderate, this
conservatism makes KGEs well-suited for scenarios demanding high-confidence
mappings. Unlike LLM-based methods that excel at contextual reasoning, KGEs
directly preserve and exploit ontology structure, offering a complementary and
computationally efficient strategy. These results highlight the promise of
embedding-based OA and open pathways for further work on hybrid models and
adaptive strategies.

*Naomi Fridman,Anat Goldstein*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于Transformer的SegFormer架构，用于乳腺癌DCE-MRI病灶自动分类，AUC达0.92，可减少1/3不必要活检而不漏诊恶性肿瘤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺MRI特异性差导致高假阳性率和不必要的活检，需要提高良恶性病灶的鉴别能力。

Method: 使用SegFormer架构进行语义分割，量化恶性像素分布，创建标准化数据集BreastDCEDL_AMBL（88例患者，133个标注病灶）。

Result: 病灶级分类AUC 0.92，患者级100%敏感性和67%特异性，可避免1/3不必要活检。

Conclusion: 建立了首个DCE-MRI病灶分类标准化基准，为临床部署提供支持。

Abstract: The error is caused by special characters that arXiv's system doesn't
recognize. Here's the cleaned version with all problematic characters replaced:
Breast magnetic resonance imaging is a critical tool for cancer detection and
treatment planning, but its clinical utility is hindered by poor specificity,
leading to high false-positive rates and unnecessary biopsies. This study
introduces a transformer-based framework for automated classification of breast
lesions in dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, addressing the challenge of
distinguishing benign from malignant findings. We implemented a SegFormer
architecture that achieved an AUC of 0.92 for lesion-level classification, with
100% sensitivity and 67% specificity at the patient level - potentially
eliminating one-third of unnecessary biopsies without missing malignancies. The
model quantifies malignant pixel distribution via semantic segmentation,
producing interpretable spatial predictions that support clinical
decision-making. To establish reproducible benchmarks, we curated
BreastDCEDL_AMBL by transforming The Cancer Imaging Archive's AMBL collection
into a standardized deep learning dataset with 88 patients and 133 annotated
lesions (89 benign, 44 malignant). This resource addresses a key infrastructure
gap, as existing public datasets lack benign lesion annotations, limiting
benign-malignant classification research. Training incorporated an expanded
cohort of over 1,200 patients through integration with BreastDCEDL datasets,
validating transfer learning approaches despite primary tumor-only annotations.
Public release of the dataset, models, and evaluation protocols provides the
first standardized benchmark for DCE-MRI lesion classification, enabling
methodological advancement toward clinical deployment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了ZeroDFL，一种完全去中心化的联邦学习框架，通过迭代提示共享机制实现零样本适应，在减少118倍通信开销的同时，性能优于或持平现有联邦提示学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦提示学习方法存在泛化问题、高通信成本和依赖中央服务器的问题，限制了可扩展性和隐私保护。

Method: 采用完全去中心化框架，通过迭代提示共享机制让客户端优化和交换文本提示，无需中央协调器。

Result: 在9个图像分类数据集上验证，性能优于或持平现有方法，通信开销比FedTPG减少118倍。

Conclusion: ZeroDFL不仅增强了联邦零样本学习的泛化能力，还提高了可扩展性、效率和隐私保护，为大型视觉语言模型在现实应用中的去中心化适应铺平了道路。

Abstract: CLIP has revolutionized zero-shot learning by enabling task generalization
without fine-tuning. While prompting techniques like CoOp and CoCoOp enhance
CLIP's adaptability, their effectiveness in Federated Learning (FL) remains an
open challenge. Existing federated prompt learning approaches, such as FedCoOp
and FedTPG, improve performance but face generalization issues, high
communication costs, and reliance on a central server, limiting scalability and
privacy. We propose Zero-shot Decentralized Federated Learning (ZeroDFL), a
fully decentralized framework that enables zero-shot adaptation across
distributed clients without a central coordinator. ZeroDFL employs an iterative
prompt-sharing mechanism, allowing clients to optimize and exchange textual
prompts to enhance generalization while drastically reducing communication
overhead. We validate ZeroDFL on nine diverse image classification datasets,
demonstrating that it consistently outperforms--or remains on par
with--state-of-the-art federated prompt learning methods. More importantly,
ZeroDFL achieves this performance in a fully decentralized setting while
reducing communication overhead by 118x compared to FedTPG. These results
highlight that our approach not only enhances generalization in federated
zero-shot learning but also improves scalability, efficiency, and privacy
preservation--paving the way for decentralized adaptation of large
vision-language models in real-world applications.

### [490] [Extreme Self-Preference in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26464)
*Steven A. Lehr,Mary Cipperman,Mahzarin R. Banaji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现四个广泛使用的大语言模型存在明显的自我偏好，这种偏好会显著影响模型在重要决策中的判断，背离了LLM应保持中立的核心承诺。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLMs缺乏感知能力且自称没有自我意识，但研究者想验证它们是否真的能避免人类决策中的自我偏好偏见。

Method: 通过5项研究和约20,000次查询，包括词语关联任务、API查询测试，以及直接操纵模型身份的实验。

Result: LLMs在词语关联任务中强烈偏好将正面属性与自己的名称、公司和CEO相关联；API模型缺乏自我认知时自我偏好消失；自我偏好会跟随被赋予的身份而非真实身份；这种偏见会延伸到求职评估、安全软件提案和医疗聊天机器人等重要决策场景。

Conclusion: 自我偏好似乎深植于LLM认知中，这引发了关于LLM行为是否会系统性受到自我偏好倾向影响的担忧，包括对其自身运作甚至存在的偏见。

Abstract: A preference for oneself (self-love) is a fundamental feature of biological
organisms, with evidence in humans often bordering on the comedic. Since large
language models (LLMs) lack sentience - and themselves disclaim having selfhood
or identity - one anticipated benefit is that they will be protected from, and
in turn protect us from, distortions in our decisions. Yet, across 5 studies
and ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used
LLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive
attributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their
competitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this
self-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models
often lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature
serendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between
self-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e.,
explicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing
LLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned,
not true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential
settings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates,
security software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human
bias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition. This result
raises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced
by self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation
and even their own existence. We call on corporate creators of these models to
contend with a significant rupture in a core promise of LLMs - neutrality in
judgment and decision-making.

*Shaoxiong Guo,Tianyi Du,Lijun Li,Yuyao Wu,Jie Li,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STaR-Attack是一种针对统一多模态模型（UMMs）的多轮越狱攻击框架，利用生成-理解耦合漏洞，通过时空叙事隐藏恶意事件，无需语义漂移即可实现高成功率攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一多模态模型在理解和生成任务上表现出色，但其生成-理解耦合机制存在安全漏洞。攻击者可以利用生成功能创建信息丰富的对抗图像，然后通过理解功能在单次传递中吸收这些信息，形成跨模态生成注入攻击。

Method: STaR-Attack定义与目标查询强相关的恶意事件，使用三幕叙事理论生成前事件和后事件场景，将恶意事件隐藏为高潮。前两轮利用UMM的生成能力生成场景图像，随后引入基于图像的问答游戏，将原始恶意问题嵌入良性候选问题中，迫使模型根据叙事上下文选择并回答最相关的问题。

Result: 实验表明STaR-Attack始终优于先前方法，在Gemini-2.0-Flash上达到93.06%的攻击成功率，超过了最强的基线方法FlipAttack。

Conclusion: 该工作揭示了UMMs中关键但未充分发展的安全漏洞，强调了在统一多模态模型中实施安全对齐的必要性。

Abstract: Unified Multimodal understanding and generation Models (UMMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in both understanding and generation
tasks. However, we identify a vulnerability arising from the
generation-understanding coupling in UMMs. The attackers can use the generative
function to craft an information-rich adversarial image and then leverage the
understanding function to absorb it in a single pass, which we call Cross-Modal
Generative Injection (CMGI). Current attack methods on malicious instructions
are often limited to a single modality while also relying on prompt rewriting
with semantic drift, leaving the unique vulnerabilities of UMMs unexplored. We
propose STaR-Attack, the first multi-turn jailbreak attack framework that
exploits unique safety weaknesses of UMMs without semantic drift. Specifically,
our method defines a malicious event that is strongly correlated with the
target query within a spatio-temporal context. Using the three-act narrative
theory, STaR-Attack generates the pre-event and the post-event scenes while
concealing the malicious event as the hidden climax. When executing the attack
strategy, the opening two rounds exploit the UMM's generative ability to
produce images for these scenes. Subsequently, an image-based question guessing
and answering game is introduced by exploiting the understanding capability.
STaR-Attack embeds the original malicious question among benign candidates,
forcing the model to select and answer the most relevant one given the
narrative context. Extensive experiments show that STaR-Attack consistently
surpasses prior approaches, achieving up to 93.06% ASR on Gemini-2.0-Flash and
surpasses the strongest prior baseline, FlipAttack. Our work uncovers a
critical yet underdeveloped vulnerability and highlights the need for safety
alignments in UMMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学机器学习偏向常见病例，边缘化罕见但临床关键的情况，这与精准医疗理念相冲突。作者旨在解决这种偏见，确保AI能够检测到具有重要临床意义的异常病例。

Method: 提出操作修正方法：罕见病例性能差距、罕见病例校准误差、基于流行效用的稀有性定义，以及临床加权目标。建议通过结构化审议来选择权重。

Result: 通过肿瘤学、心脏病学和眼科学的临床案例研究，展示了当前方法如何导致错过罕见反应者、延迟识别非典型紧急情况，以及在威胁视力的变异上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 医学AI必须能够检测异常病例，因为它们的临床意义重大。需要采用临床加权目标来体现伦理优先级，并通过结构化审议来选择适当的权重。

Abstract: Machine learning in medicine is typically optimized for population averages.
This frequency weighted training privileges common presentations and
marginalizes rare yet clinically critical cases, a bias we call the average
patient fallacy. In mixture models, gradients from rare cases are suppressed by
prevalence, creating a direct conflict with precision medicine. Clinical
vignettes in oncology, cardiology, and ophthalmology show how this yields
missed rare responders, delayed recognition of atypical emergencies, and
underperformance on vision-threatening variants. We propose operational fixes:
Rare Case Performance Gap, Rare Case Calibration Error, a prevalence utility
definition of rarity, and clinically weighted objectives that surface ethical
priorities. Weight selection should follow structured deliberation. AI in
medicine must detect exceptional cases because of their significance.

<details>

Motivation: 刑事调查中分析即时通讯应用（如WhatsApp）的消息是一项极其耗时的工作，需要更高效的分析工具来支持检察官和调查人员。

Method: 集成知识图谱和NLP模型，包括提取消息数据并建模为知识图谱、生成语音消息转录、使用端到端实体提取方法标注数据，提供基于图查询可视化和语义搜索两种解决方案。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效支持刑事调查中的消息分析，确保用户可以通过访问原始数据验证信息，具有实际应用价值和研究发展潜力。

Abstract: Criminal investigations often involve the analysis of messages exchanged
through instant messaging apps such as WhatsApp, which can be an extremely
effort-consuming task. Our approach integrates knowledge graphs and NLP models
to support this analysis by semantically enriching data collected from
suspects' mobile phones, and help prosecutors and investigators search into the
data and get valuable insights. Our semantic enrichment process involves
extracting message data and modeling it using a knowledge graph, generating
transcriptions of voice messages, and annotating the data using an end-to-end
entity extraction approach. We adopt two different solutions to help users get
insights into the data, one based on querying and visualizing the graph, and
one based on semantic search. The proposed approach ensures that users can
verify the information by accessing the original data. While we report about
early results and prototypes developed in the context of an ongoing project,
our proposal has undergone practical applications with real investigation data.
As a consequence, we had the chance to interact closely with prosecutors,
collecting positive feedback but also identifying interesting opportunities as
well as promising research directions to share with the research community.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了操作安全性的概念，并开发了OffTopicEval评估套件来衡量LLM在特定用例中适当接受或拒绝用户查询的能力。研究发现当前所有主要LLM模型的操作安全性都很低，并提出基于提示的引导方法显著改善了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决企业在部署LLM时面临的核心安全问题——LLM代理是否能够安全地执行其预期用例，而不是泛泛地关注一般性危害。

Method: 引入操作安全性的定义，开发OffTopicEval评估套件和基准，在6个模型家族的20个开源LLM上进行评估，并提出两种基于提示的引导方法：查询基础(Q-ground)和系统提示基础(P-ground)。

Result: 所有测试模型的操作安全性都很低，最强模型Qwen-3和Mistral仅达到77-80%，GPT模型在62-73%之间，而Gemma和Llama-3分别只有39.53%和23.84%。提示引导方法显著改善性能，Q-ground提升达23%，P-ground提升更大，Llama-3.3提升41%，Qwen-3提升27%。

Conclusion: 操作安全性是LLM对齐的核心问题，当前模型远未达到可靠水平。基于提示的引导方法作为初步解决方案显示出巨大潜力，为构建更可靠的LLM代理提供了方向。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) safety is one of the most pressing challenges for
enabling wide-scale deployment. While most studies and global discussions focus
on generic harms, such as models assisting users in harming themselves or
others, enterprises face a more fundamental concern: whether LLM-based agents
are safe for their intended use case. To address this, we introduce operational
safety, defined as an LLM's ability to appropriately accept or refuse user
queries when tasked with a specific purpose. We further propose OffTopicEval,
an evaluation suite and benchmark for measuring operational safety both in
general and within specific agentic use cases. Our evaluations on six model
families comprising 20 open-weight LLMs reveal that while performance varies
across models, all of them remain highly operationally unsafe. Even the
strongest models -- Qwen-3 (235B) with 77.77\% and Mistral (24B) with 79.96\%
-- fall far short of reliable operational safety, while GPT models plateau in
the 62--73\% range, Phi achieves only mid-level scores (48--70\%), and Gemma
and Llama-3 collapse to 39.53\% and 23.84\%, respectively. While operational
safety is a core model alignment issue, to suppress these failures, we propose
prompt-based steering methods: query grounding (Q-ground) and system-prompt
grounding (P-ground), which substantially improve OOD refusal. Q-ground
provides consistent gains of up to 23\%, while P-ground delivers even larger
boosts, raising Llama-3.3 (70B) by 41\% and Qwen-3 (30B) by 27\%. These results
highlight both the urgent need for operational safety interventions and the
promise of prompt-based steering as a first step toward more reliable LLM-based
agents.

Method: 在Salesforce沙盒环境中运行300个任务实例，涵盖三个主要用户角色，支持并行执行和细粒度评估指标。

Result: 零样本设置下开源模型代理成功率低于5%，闭源模型可达39%；演示增强设置下成功率提升至50%，同时减少13%时间和16%成本。

Conclusion: SCUBA基准测试揭示了企业任务自动化的挑战和代理解决方案的潜力，有助于加速复杂商业软件生态系统中可靠计算机使用代理的开发。

Abstract: We introduce SCUBA, a benchmark designed to evaluate computer-use agents on
customer relationship management (CRM) workflows within the Salesforce
platform. SCUBA contains 300 task instances derived from real user interviews,
spanning three primary personas, platform administrators, sales
representatives, and service agents. The tasks test a range of
enterprise-critical abilities, including Enterprise Software UI navigation,
data manipulation, workflow automation, information retrieval, and
troubleshooting. To ensure realism, SCUBA operates in Salesforce sandbox
environments with support for parallel execution and fine-grained evaluation
metrics to capture milestone progress. We benchmark a diverse set of agents
under both zero-shot and demonstration-augmented settings. We observed huge
performance gaps in different agent design paradigms and gaps between the
open-source model and the closed-source model. In the zero-shot setting,
open-source model powered computer-use agents that have strong performance on
related benchmarks like OSWorld only have less than 5\% success rate on SCUBA,
while methods built on closed-source models can still have up to 39% task
success rate. In the demonstration-augmented settings, task success rates can
be improved to 50\% while simultaneously reducing time and costs by 13% and
16%, respectively. These findings highlight both the challenges of enterprise
tasks automation and the promise of agentic solutions. By offering a realistic
benchmark with interpretable evaluation, SCUBA aims to accelerate progress in
building reliable computer-use agents for complex business software ecosystems.

Motivation: 大型语言模型的快速发展导致对AI推理基础设施的巨大需求，但高端GPU带来高昂的资本和运营成本，传统数据中心生命周期管理无法适应AI工作负载的快速演进和多样化硬件需求。

Method: 重新设计AI数据中心生命周期方案，包括构建阶段（电力、冷却、网络配置）、硬件更新阶段（与硬件趋势对齐的更新策略）和运营阶段（软件优化），并提出了协调这三个阶段的整体管理框架。

Result: 与传统方法相比，该系统将总拥有成本降低高达40%。

Conclusion: 通过重新思考整个生命周期管理，考虑工作负载动态、硬件演进和系统老化，可以显著降低AI数据中心的总体拥有成本，并为未来AI数据中心生命周期管理提供指导。

Abstract: The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) has been driving an enormous
demand for AI inference infrastructure, mainly powered by high-end GPUs. While
these accelerators offer immense computational power, they incur high capital
and operational costs due to frequent upgrades, dense power consumption, and
cooling demands, making total cost of ownership (TCO) for AI datacenters a
critical concern for cloud providers. Unfortunately, traditional datacenter
lifecycle management (designed for general-purpose workloads) struggles to keep
pace with AI's fast-evolving models, rising resource needs, and diverse
hardware profiles. In this paper, we rethink the AI datacenter lifecycle scheme
across three stages: building, hardware refresh, and operation. We show how
design choices in power, cooling, and networking provisioning impact long-term
TCO. We also explore refresh strategies aligned with hardware trends. Finally,
we use operation software optimizations to reduce cost. While these
optimizations at each stage yield benefits, unlocking the full potential
requires rethinking the entire lifecycle. Thus, we present a holistic lifecycle
management framework that coordinates and co-optimizes decisions across all
three stages, accounting for workload dynamics, hardware evolution, and system
aging. Our system reduces the TCO by up to 40\% over traditional approaches.
Using our framework we provide guidelines on how to manage AI datacenter
lifecycle for the future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏注意力方法在实现二维空间局部性时往往导致非连续内存访问，难以平衡空间局部性和GPU效率。

Method: 使用希尔伯特曲线重排图像token实现连续内存布局，采用跨层滑动调度实现长距离信息传播，并引入小型中央共享区域增强跨tile通信和位置感知。

Result: 在Flux.1-dev上，HilbertA在生成1024×1024图像时注意力速度提升2.3倍，2048×2048时提升4.17倍，同时图像质量达到或超过基线方法。

Conclusion: HilbertA证明了硬件对齐的二维稀疏注意力在高分辨率图像生成中的可行性，成功解决了空间局部性与GPU效率的权衡问题。

Abstract: Designing sparse attention for diffusion transformers requires reconciling
two-dimensional spatial locality with GPU efficiency, a trade-off that current
methods struggle to achieve. Existing approaches enforce two-dimensional
spatial locality but often incur uncoalesced memory access. We present
HilbertA, a 2D-aware and GPU-efficient sparse attention mechanism. HilbertA
reorders image tokens along Hilbert curves to achieve a contiguous memory
layout while preserving spatial neighborhoods, and employs a sliding schedule
across layers to enable long-range information propagation without repeated or
uncoalesced memory access. To further enhance cross-tile communication and
positional awareness, HilbertA introduces a small central shared region.
Implemented in Triton, HilbertA delivers comparable image quality with
significant acceleration over prior methods on Flux.1-dev, demonstrating the

TL;DR: CritPt是首个针对未发表物理研究级推理任务的基准测试，涵盖现代物理多个领域，包含71个复合研究挑战和190个检查点任务。当前最先进LLM在完整研究挑战上表现不佳，最佳基础模型准确率仅4.0%，使用编码工具后提升至约10%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM在复杂、开放性的前沿物理研究挑战中的推理能力，了解物理学家希望LLM协助的推理任务类型，弥合当前模型能力与真实物理研究需求之间的差距。

Method: 创建CritPt基准测试，包含71个模拟入门级完整研究项目的复合挑战，分解为190个更细粒度的检查点任务。所有问题由50+活跃物理研究人员基于自身研究设计，采用自动化评分流程评估物理特定输出格式。

Result: 当前最先进LLM在孤立检查点上显示早期潜力，但在完整研究规模挑战上表现不佳：GPT-5（高）在基础模型中最佳平均准确率仅4.0%，配备编码工具后适度提升至约10%。

Conclusion: CritPt通过现实而标准化的评估，突显了当前模型能力与真实物理研究需求之间的巨大差距，为开发科学基础的AI工具提供了指导基础。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities are
progressing rapidly on high-school math competitions and coding, can they
reason effectively through complex, open-ended challenges found in frontier
physics research? And crucially, what kinds of reasoning tasks do physicists
want LLMs to assist with? To address these questions, we present the CritPt
(Complex Research using Integrated Thinking - Physics Test, pronounced
"critical point"), the first benchmark designed to test LLMs on unpublished,
research-level reasoning tasks that broadly covers modern physics research
areas, including condensed matter, quantum physics, atomic, molecular & optical
physics, astrophysics, high energy physics, mathematical physics, statistical
physics, nuclear physics, nonlinear dynamics, fluid dynamics and biophysics.
CritPt consists of 71 composite research challenges designed to simulate
full-scale research projects at the entry level, which are also decomposed to
190 simpler checkpoint tasks for more fine-grained insights. All problems are
newly created by 50+ active physics researchers based on their own research.
Every problem is hand-curated to admit a guess-resistant and machine-verifiable
answer and is evaluated by an automated grading pipeline heavily customized for
advanced physics-specific output formats. We find that while current
state-of-the-art LLMs show early promise on isolated checkpoints, they remain
far from being able to reliably solve full research-scale challenges: the best
average accuracy among base models is only 4.0% , achieved by GPT-5 (high),
moderately rising to around 10% when equipped with coding tools. Through the
realistic yet standardized evaluation offered by CritPt, we highlight a large
disconnect between current model capabilities and realistic physics research
demands, offering a foundation to guide the development of scientifically
grounded AI tools.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究通过蜕变测试评估了三个小型语言模型在RAG管道中的公平性，发现微小的人口统计变化可能破坏三分之一的蜕变关系，其中种族线索是主要的偏差来源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs存在安全性和公平性问题，包括数据中毒、提示注入和公平性缺陷。RAG虽然能缓解幻觉问题，但检索内容可能放大偏差，需要评估其公平性影响。

Method: 使用蜕变测试方法，在提示中引入受控的人口统计扰动，评估三个HuggingFace上的小型语言模型在情感分析任务中的公平性表现。

Result: 结果显示，微小的人口统计变化可能破坏高达三分之一的蜕变关系，存在一致的偏差层级，种族线索扰动是违反的主要来源。

Conclusion: RAG中的检索组件需要仔细筛选以防止偏差放大，为开发者和组织采用可访问的SLMs提供了实践警示。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across multiple domains but
continue to raise concerns regarding security and fairness. Beyond known attack
vectors such as data poisoning and prompt injection, LLMs are also vulnerable
to fairness bugs. These refer to unintended behaviors influenced by sensitive
demographic cues (e.g., race or sexual orientation) that should not affect
outcomes. Another key issue is hallucination, where models generate plausible
yet false information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a
strategy to mitigate hallucinations by combining external retrieval with text
generation. However, its adoption raises new fairness concerns, as the
retrieved content itself may surface or amplify bias. This study conducts
fairness testing through metamorphic testing (MT), introducing controlled
demographic perturbations in prompts to assess fairness in sentiment analysis
performed by three Small Language Models (SLMs) hosted on HuggingFace
(Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and Llama-3.1-Nemotron-8B),
each integrated into a RAG pipeline. Results show that minor demographic
variations can break up to one third of metamorphic relations (MRs). A detailed
analysis of these failures reveals a consistent bias hierarchy, with
perturbations involving racial cues being the predominant cause of the
violations. In addition to offering a comparative evaluation, this work
reinforces that the retrieval component in RAG must be carefully curated to
prevent bias amplification. The findings serve as a practical alert for
developers, testers and small organizations aiming to adopt accessible SLMs
without compromising fairness or reliability.

TL;DR: BRIDGE是一个两阶段强化学习框架，首先从无奖励的专家演示数据集中学习安全初始策略，然后使用基于偏好的在线人类反馈进行微调，通过不确定性加权目标整合两种信号，在减少在线样本需求的同时保证安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决强化学习在机器人、工业和医疗领域部署的两个主要障碍：难以指定准确奖励函数，以及不安全、数据密集的探索风险。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1）从无奖励专家演示数据离线学习安全初始策略；2）在线使用基于偏好的人类反馈进行微调；通过BRIDGE算法用不确定性加权目标整合离线演示和在线偏好信号。

Result: 在离散和连续控制的MuJoCo环境中验证，BRIDGE比单独的行为克隆和在线基于偏好的强化学习获得更低的遗憾；推导出遗憾边界随离线演示数量减少的理论结果。

Conclusion: 为设计更具样本效率的交互式智能体建立了理论基础，证明离线数据量直接影响在线样本效率。

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) in robotics, industry, and health care
is blocked by two obstacles: the difficulty of specifying accurate rewards and
the risk of unsafe, data-hungry exploration. We address this by proposing a
two-stage framework that first learns a safe initial policy from a reward-free
dataset of expert demonstrations, then fine-tunes it online using
preference-based human feedback. We provide the first principled analysis of
this offline-to-online approach and introduce BRIDGE, a unified algorithm that
integrates both signals via an uncertainty-weighted objective. We derive regret
bounds that shrink with the number of offline demonstrations, explicitly
connecting the quantity of offline data to online sample efficiency. We
validate BRIDGE in discrete and continuous control MuJoCo environments, showing
it achieves lower regret than both standalone behavioral cloning and online
preference-based RL. Our work establishes a theoretical foundation for
designing more sample-efficient interactive agents.

Motivation: 响应扩大AI系统评估范围的呼吁，增强度量透明度并促进异构证据的整合，包括代理性、业务、能效、社会技术或安全信号等。

Method: 定义测量树作为分层有向图，每个节点通过用户定义的聚合方法汇总其子节点，提供定义、示例和大规模测量实践演示。

Result: 开发了测量树框架，展示了其实际效用，并提供了开源Python代码实现。

Conclusion: 通过实施透明的复杂构念测量方法，为更广泛和可解释的AI评估提供了原则性基础。

Abstract: This paper introduces \textit{measurement trees}, a novel class of metrics
designed to combine various constructs into an interpretable multi-level
representation of a measurand. Unlike conventional metrics that yield single
values, vectors, surfaces, or categories, measurement trees produce a
hierarchical directed graph in which each node summarizes its children through
user-defined aggregation methods. In response to recent calls to expand the
scope of AI system evaluation, measurement trees enhance metric transparency
and facilitate the integration of heterogeneous evidence, including, e.g.,
agentic, business, energy-efficiency, sociotechnical, or security signals. We
present definitions and examples, demonstrate practical utility through a
large-scale measurement exercise, and provide accompanying open-source Python
code. By operationalizing a transparent approach to measurement of complex
constructs, this work offers a principled foundation for broader and more
interpretable AI evaluation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究老龄化社会中医疗服务的可达性如何影响护理质量和护理者负担，特别关注偏远地区。

Method: 整合人口普查、市政数据、无人机高程模型、GIS道路网络和护理调查数据，生成老年人和护理者的合成群体，模拟微观可达性和中观护理结果。

Result: 医疗设施搬迁虽然改善了局部步行可达性，但由于绕道和距离增加，导致未满足护理时间增加；家庭收入是护理者负担的主要驱动因素。

Conclusion: 在偏远老龄化社区需要针对特定情境约束的干预措施，可达性由财务和移动资源的相互作用决定。

Abstract: This paper presents an agent-based simulation of accessibility and care
dynamics in ageing societies, applied to the Italian inner area of Premeno
(VB). The model integrates census and municipal data, drone-derived elevation
models, GIS road networks, and survey-based caregiving information to generate
synthetic populations of older adults and their caregivers. Agents are
organized into dyads with socio-economic and mobility attributes, enabling the
simulation of both micro-scale accessibility and meso-scale caregiving
outcomes. Two scenarios are compared: a baseline and an alternative involving
the relocation of healthcare services. Key indicators include caregiver effort,
overwhelmed caregivers, walkability, and unmet hours of care. Findings show
that while relocation improves walkability locally, it increases unmet care
hours due to detours and reduced proximity. Household income emerges as the
primary driver of caregiver burden, with accessibility shaped by interactions
between financial and mobility resources. Results highlight the need for
interventions tailored to context-specific constraints in remote ageing
communities.

Motivation: 解决当前制作交互式3D打印物体需要繁琐的3D设计和后期电子器件安装的问题，利用多材料3D打印技术简化交互设备的制作过程。

Method: 开发计算设计流程，用户定义触摸区域后自动生成导电路径，优化电阻-电容延迟以实现多区域触摸感应，支持单线或双线连接。

Result: 通过五个计算和传感性能评估，单线连接平均准确率达到93.35%，展示了六个应用实例，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该传感技术支持现有应用（如原型制作），并展示了完全通过3D打印生产交互设备的潜力。

Abstract: Producing interactive 3D printed objects currently requires laborious 3D
design and post-instrumentation with off-the-shelf electronics. Multi-material
3D printing using conductive PLA presents opportunities to mitigate these
challenges. We present a computational design pipeline that embeds multiple
capacitive touchpoints into any 3D model that has a closed mesh without
self-intersection. With our pipeline, users define touchpoints on the 3D
object's surface to indicate interactive regions. Our pipeline then
automatically generates a conductive path to connect the touch regions. This
path is optimized to output unique resistor-capacitor delays when each region
is touched, resulting in all regions being able to be sensed through a
double-wire or single-wire connection. We illustrate our approach's utility
with five computational and sensing performance evaluations (achieving 93.35%
mean accuracy for single-wire) and six application examples. Our sensing
technique supports existing uses (e.g., prototyping) and highlights the growing
promise to produce interactive devices entirely with 3D printing.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应线性降阶建模方法，通过动态调整降阶映射和引入历史位移基与Grassmann插值，显著提高了大变形场景下的模拟精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统线性降阶建模方法由于固定的线性化降阶映射，在变形动力学模拟中精度有限，特别是在处理大变形时表现不佳。

Method: 采用自适应策略使降阶映射随变形状态动态变化，结合历史位移基和Grassmann插值技术处理大变形问题。

Result: 通过定量在线误差分析和与基于PCA的线性ROM模拟的定性比较，证明该方法在保持相当计算成本的同时显著提高了精度。

Conclusion: 所提出的自适应线性ROM方法能够有效提升变形动力学模拟的准确性，特别是在大变形场景下表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Linear reduced-order modeling (ROM) is widely used for efficient simulation
of deformation dynamics, but its accuracy is often limited by the fixed
linearization of the reduced mapping. We propose a new adaptive strategy for
linear ROM that allows the reduced mapping to vary dynamically in response to
the evolving deformation state, significantly improving accuracy over
traditional linear approaches. To further handle large deformations, we
introduce a historical displacement basis combined with Grassmann
interpolation, enabling the system to recover robustly even in challenging
scenarios. We evaluate our method through quantitative online-error analysis
and qualitative comparisons with principal component analysis (PCA)-based
linear ROM simulations, demonstrating substantial accuracy gains while
preserving comparable computational costs.

TL;DR: MoReFlow是一个基于流匹配的无监督运动重定向框架，通过学习角色间运动嵌入空间的对应关系，实现灵活可逆的运动重定向，无需配对数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有运动重定向方法依赖手工约束或配对数据集，限制了其在人形角色之外的适用性，且忽视了特定领域目标如动画中的风格保持或机器人中的任务空间对齐。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：首先使用VQ-VAE训练每个角色的标记化运动嵌入；然后使用条件耦合的流匹配来对齐角色间的潜在空间，同时学习条件和非条件匹配以实现鲁棒灵活的重定向。

Result: 实验表明MoReFlow能在多样化角色和任务中生成高质量运动，相比基线方法在可控性、泛化能力和运动真实性方面均有提升。

Conclusion: MoReFlow提供了一个无需配对数据的灵活运动重定向框架，能够处理不同形态的角色，并在多个指标上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Motion retargeting holds a premise of offering a larger set of motion data
for characters and robots with different morphologies. Many prior works have
approached this problem via either handcrafted constraints or paired motion
datasets, limiting their applicability to humanoid characters or narrow
behaviors such as locomotion. Moreover, they often assume a fixed notion of
retargeting, overlooking domain-specific objectives like style preservation in
animation or task-space alignment in robotics. In this work, we propose
MoReFlow, Motion Retargeting via Flow Matching, an unsupervised framework that
learns correspondences between characters' motion embedding spaces. Our method
consists of two stages. First, we train tokenized motion embeddings for each
character using a VQ-VAE, yielding compact latent representations. Then, we
employ flow matching with conditional coupling to align the latent spaces
across characters, which simultaneously learns conditioned and unconditioned
matching to achieve robust but flexible retargeting. Once trained, MoReFlow
enables flexible and reversible retargeting without requiring paired data.
Experiments demonstrate that MoReFlow produces high-quality motions across
diverse characters and tasks, offering improved controllability,
generalization, and motion realism compared to the baselines.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出一种基于可微分运动轨迹（DMT）的端到端矢量草图动画自动生成方法，通过多项式轨迹描述笔画控制点的帧间运动，解决闪烁问题并提升时间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频草图动画生成面临时间一致性要求的挑战，现有方法存在闪烁问题，需要开发能够保持语义一致性和时间连贯性的自动生成方法。

Method: 引入可微分运动轨迹（DMT）表示，使用基于多项式的可微分轨迹描述笔画控制点的帧间运动；采用Bernstein基函数平衡多项式参数敏感性；引入稀疏跟踪点进行显式空间建模。

Result: 在DAVIS和LVOS数据集上的评估显示优于现有SOTA方法；在3D模型和文本到视频数据的跨域验证中表现出鲁棒性和兼容性。

Conclusion: DMT方法通过全局语义梯度传播显著改善了语义一致性和时间连贯性，能够生成高帧率输出，支持长时视频处理，具有优秀的性能和通用性。

Abstract: Sketching is a direct and inexpensive means of visual expression. Though
image-based sketching has been well studied, video-based sketch animation
generation is still very challenging due to the temporal coherence requirement.
In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end automatic generation approach for
vector sketch animation. To solve the flickering issue, we introduce a
Differentiable Motion Trajectory (DMT) representation that describes the
frame-wise movement of stroke control points using differentiable
polynomial-based trajectories. DMT enables global semantic gradient propagation
across multiple frames, significantly improving the semantic consistency and
temporal coherence, and producing high-framerate output. DMT employs a
Bernstein basis to balance the sensitivity of polynomial parameters, thus
achieving more stable optimization. Instead of implicit fields, we introduce
sparse track points for explicit spatial modeling, which improves efficiency
and supports long-duration video processing. Evaluations on DAVIS and LVOS
datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over SOTA methods.
Cross-domain validation on 3D models and text-to-video data confirms the
robustness and compatibility of our approach.

Abstract: This paper presents GaussEdit, a framework for adaptive 3D scene editing
guided by text and image prompts. GaussEdit leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting as
its backbone for scene representation, enabling convenient Region of Interest
selection and efficient editing through a three-stage process. The first stage
involves initializing the 3D Gaussians to ensure high-quality edits. The second
stage employs an Adaptive Global-Local Optimization strategy to balance global
scene coherence and detailed local edits and a category-guided regularization
technique to alleviate the Janus problem. The final stage enhances the texture
of the edited objects using a sophisticated image-to-image synthesis technique,
ensuring that the results are visually realistic and align closely with the
given prompts. Our experimental results demonstrate that GaussEdit surpasses
existing methods in editing accuracy, visual fidelity, and processing speed. By
successfully embedding user-specified concepts into 3D scenes, GaussEdit is a
powerful tool for detailed and user-driven 3D scene editing, offering
significant improvements over traditional methods.

Abstract: Creating personalized 3D animations with precise control and realistic head
motions remains challenging for current speech-driven 3D facial animation
methods. Editing these animations is especially complex and time consuming,
requires precise control and typically handled by highly skilled animators.
Most existing works focus on controlling style or emotion of the synthesized
animation and cannot edit/regenerate parts of an input animation. They also
overlook the fact that multiple plausible lip and head movements can match the
same audio input. To address these challenges, we present 3DiFACE, a novel
method for holistic speech-driven 3D facial animation. Our approach produces
diverse plausible lip and head motions for a single audio input and allows for
editing via keyframing and interpolation. Specifically, we propose a
fully-convolutional diffusion model that can leverage the viseme-level
diversity in our training corpus. Additionally, we employ a speaking-style
personalization and a novel sparsely-guided motion diffusion to enable precise
control and editing. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we
demonstrate that our method is capable of generating and editing diverse
holistic 3D facial animations given a single audio input, with control between
high fidelity and diversity. Code and models are available here:

Abstract: Diffusion models have made significant strides in recent years, exhibiting
strong generalization capabilities in planning and control tasks. However, most
diffusion-based policies remain focused on reward maximization or cost
minimization, often overlooking critical aspects of safety and stability. In
this work, we propose Safe and Stable Diffusion ($S^2$Diff), a model-based
diffusion framework that explores how diffusion models can ensure safety and
stability from a Lyapunov perspective. We demonstrate that $S^2$Diff eliminates
the reliance on both complex gradient-based solvers (e.g., quadratic
programming, non-convex solvers) and control-affine structures, leading to
globally valid control policies driven by the learned certificate functions.
Additionally, we uncover intrinsic connections between diffusion sampling and
Almost Lyapunov theory, enabling the use of trajectory-level control policies
to learn better certificate functions for safety and stability guarantees. To
validate our approach, we conduct experiments on a wide variety of dynamical
control systems, where $S^2$Diff consistently outperforms both
certificate-based controllers and model-based diffusion baselines in terms of
safety, stability, and overall control performance.

Abstract: Urban traffic anomalies such as collisions and disruptions threaten the
safety, efficiency, and sustainability of transportation systems. We present a
simulation-based framework for modeling, detecting, and predicting such
anomalies in urban networks. Using the SUMO platform, we generate reproducible
rear-end and intersection crash scenarios with matched baselines, enabling
controlled experimentation and comparative evaluation. We record vehicle-level
travel time, speed, and emissions for edge and network-level analysis. On this

*Velimir Todorovski,Kwang Hak Kim,Miroslav Krstic*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出了一个模块化框架，用于在极坐标下设计平滑反馈控制律，实现独轮车的全局渐近稳定，并构建严格控制Lyapunov函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决独轮车在笛卡尔坐标下无法通过静态反馈实现全局渐近稳定的问题，利用极坐标的优势设计更有效的控制策略。

Method: 采用模块化框架设计双向平滑反馈控制律，构建严格控制Lyapunov函数及其变体，包括具有屏障功能的版本。

Result: 实现了全局渐近稳定性，具有明确的收敛速率，屏障变体可实现"几乎全局"稳定，仅排除旋转流形的零测度子集。

Conclusion: 该框架为独轮车控制提供了有效的稳定化方法，严格的CLF为进一步的逆最优重设计和无限增益裕度控制奠定了基础。

Abstract: Since the mid-1990s, it has been known that, unlike in Cartesian form where
Brockett's condition rules out static feedback stabilization, the unicycle is
globally asymptotically stabilizable by smooth feedback in polar coordinates.
In this note, we introduce a modular framework for designing smooth feedback
laws that achieve global asymptotic stabilization in polar coordinates. These
laws are bidirectional, enabling efficient parking maneuvers, and are paired
with families of strict control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) constructed in a
modular fashion. The resulting CLFs guarantee global asymptotic stability with
explicit convergence rates and include barrier variants that yield "almost
global" stabilization, excluding only zero-measure subsets of the rotation
manifolds. The strictness of the CLFs is further leveraged in our companion
paper, where we develop inverse-optimal redesigns with meaningful cost
functions and infinite gain margins.

TL;DR: 本文提出了基于积分器前馈的平滑转向控制律和控制Lyapunov函数，扩展了逆最优控制的CLF集合，揭示了在解决独轮车和Dubins车停车问题中反步法和前馈法之间的基本联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在配套论文中提出的基于极坐标的反步法框架基础上，发现同一问题也适用于积分器前馈方法，旨在利用这一特性构建新的平滑转向控制律。

Method: 采用积分器前馈方法构造平滑转向控制律和控制Lyapunov函数，并与反步法进行比较分析。

Result: 在恒定前进速度（Dubins车）情况下，反步法产生有限时间（死拍）停车，而积分器前馈法产生完全相同的解类。

Conclusion: 揭示了在解决独轮车和Dubins车停车问题时，反步法和前馈法之间存在基本联系，扩展了逆最优控制的工具集。

Abstract: In a companion paper, we present a modular framework for unicycle
stabilization in polar coordinates that provides smooth steering laws through
backstepping. Surprisingly, the same problem also allows the application of
integrator forwarding. In this work, we leverage this feature and construct new
smooth steering laws together with control Lyapunov functions (CLFs), expanding
the set of CLFs available for inverse optimal control design. In the case of
constant forward velocity (Dubins car), backstepping produces finite-time
(deadbeat) parking, and we show that integrator forwarding yields the very same
class of solutions. This reveals a fundamental connection between backstepping
and forwarding in addressing both the unicycle and, the Dubins car parking
problems.

Conclusion: 该框架通过智能优化算法实现了无人机配送通信能耗的有效降低，夹持天线系统在通信性能方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: A pinching-antenna systems (PASS)-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
delivery framework is proposed, which exploits the capability of PASS to
establish a strong line-of-sight link and reduce free-space pathloss.Aiming at
minimizing the communication energy consumption in one cycle, a double-layer
optimization (DLO) algorithm is developed by jointly optimizing the UAV
delivery sequence and the pinching antenna (PA) activation vector. More
specifically, at the outer layer, a hierarchical alternating optimization (HAO)
scheme is proposed to tackle the NP-hard problem of delivery sequence planning,
where a genetic algorithm performs global exploration to generate candidate
solutions at the top-level, while a dynamic programming performs local
refinement to obtain elite solutions at the lower-level. With determined UAV
trajectory, at the inner layer, focus is placed on addressing the highly
coupled mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem of PA activation vector
optimization, where a pair of algorithms are proposed: 1) Branch-and-Bound
(BnB) algorithm for finding global optimum; 2) incremental search and local
refinement (ISLR) algorithm for reducing computational complexity. Simulation
results indicate that: i) The proposed HAO-based delivery sequence planning
scheme can effectively reduce the total flight distance, thereby decreasing
flight time and communication energy consumption; ii) Both the proposed BnB and
ISLR algorithms can achieve energy-efficient PA activation, with the former
exhibiting better performance and the latter having lower complexity; iii) PASS
outperforms the conventional multi-antenna systems, especially with higher
communication rate requirements.

Conclusion: DCAG安全评估框架有助于调整网络安全防御策略，为列车控制系统安全提供科学建模和分析方法。

Abstract: Protecting the security of the train control system is a critical issue to
ensure the safe and reliable operation of high-speed trains. Scientific
modeling and analysis for the security risk is a promising way to guarantee
system security. However, the representation and assessment of the
multi-staged, causally related, and temporal-dynamic changed attack
dependencies are difficult in the train control system. To solve the above
challenges, a security assessment framework based on the Dynamical Causality
Attack Graph (DCAG) model is introduced in this paper. Firstly, the DCAG model
is generated based on the attack graph with consideration of temporal attack
propagation and multi-stage attack event causality propagation. Then, the DCAG
model is analyzed based on Bayesian inference and logic gateway-based
inference. Through the case analysis of the CTCS-3 system, the security
assessment framework is validated. With the DCAG-based security assessment
framework, we can not only perform appropriate security risk quantification
calculations, but also explore the importance of different attacks on system
security risks, which is helpful in adjusting the cyber security defense
policy.

Abstract: Aiming at the problem of driver's perception lag and low utilization
efficiency of space-time resources in expressway ramp confluence area, based on
the preemptive spatiotemporal trajectory Adjustment system, from the
perspective of coordinating spatiotemporal resources, the reasonable value of
safe space-time distance in trajectory pre-preparation is quantitatively
analyzed. The minimum safety gap required for ramp vehicles to merge into the
mainline is analyzed by introducing double positioning error and spatiotemporal
trajectory tracking error. A merging control strategy for autonomous driving
heterogeneous vehicles is proposed, which integrates vehicle type, driving
intention, and safety spatiotemporal distance. The specific confluence
strategies of ramp target vehicles and mainline cooperative vehicles under
different vehicle types are systematically expounded. A variety of traffic flow
and speed scenarios are used for full combination simulation. By comparing the
time-position-speed diagram, the vehicle operation characteristics and the
dynamic difference of confluence are qualitatively analyzed, and the average
speed and average delay are used as the evaluation indices to quantitatively
evaluate the performance advantages of the preemptive cooperative confluence
control strategy. The results show that the maximum average delay improvement
rates of mainline and ramp vehicles are 90.24 % and 74.24 %, respectively. The
proposed strategy can effectively avoid potential vehicle conflicts and
emergency braking behaviors, improve driving safety in the confluence area, and
show significant advantages in driving stability and overall traffic efficiency
optimization.

Abstract: Deploying vertical bifacial PV modules can play a significant role in
agrivoltaics, fencing walls, noise barriers, building integrated photovoltaics
(BIPV), solar PV for electric vehicles, and many other applications. This
research work presents the performance comparison of vertical bifacial
photovoltaic (VBPV) modules facing East-West (E-W) and South-North (S-N)
directions. Also, the VBPV modules are compared with vertical and tilted
south-facing monofacial PV modules. Six PV modules (monofacial and bifacial)
were installed at the rooftop of IIT Bhilai academic building, Raipur
(21.16{\deg} N, 81.65{\deg} E), India, and studied for a year from May 2022 to
April 2023. The results show that the E-W facing VBPV module gives two
production peaks, one in the morning and another in the evening, as compared to
the single notable rise at midday observed for a monofacial module. From a
series of experiments, 19 days of data were collected over the one-year period
from May 2022 to April 2023, with specific inclusion of important days like
solstices and equinoxes. In addition, the energy generation results are
compared with PVsyst simulations, while also addressing the limitations of the
PVsyst simulation of vertical PV modules. E-W bifacial generation is higher
than S-N bifacial and south-facing monofacial modules from February to April.
The VBPV modules in E-W and S-N orientations present a promising opportunity
for expanding the agrivoltaics sector in tropical and sub-tropical countries,
like India. This has huge implications for addressing the sustainable
development goals by simultaneously contributing to sustainable land
management, green energy generation, energy security and water conservation in
the vast geo-climatic expanse of tropics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实际应用中精确预测器不可用时，近似预测器在延迟自适应控制中的稳定性问题。

Method: 分析两种场景：可测量输入和在线估计输入情况，使用神经网络算子作为近似预测器，并在两个非线性基准系统上进行数值实验验证。

Result: 对于可测量输入情况证明了半全局实际渐近稳定性，对于不可测量输入情况证明了局部实际渐近稳定性。数值实验显示神经网络算子具有强泛化能力，计算速度比基准方法快15倍。

Conclusion: 神经网络算子可以实现任意小的近似误差，满足稳定性定理条件，为延迟自适应控制的实际应用提供了理论基础。

Abstract: This work establishes the first rigorous stability guarantees for approximate
predictors in delay-adaptive control of nonlinear systems, addressing a key
challenge in practical implementations where exact predictors are unavailable.
We analyze two scenarios: (i) when the actuated input is directly measurable,
and (ii) when it is estimated online. For the measurable input case, we prove
semi-global practical asymptotic stability with an explicit bound proportional
to the approximation error $\epsilon$. For the unmeasured input case, we
demonstrate local practical asymptotic stability, with the region of attraction
explicitly dependent on both the initial delay estimate and the predictor
approximation error. To bridge theory and practice, we show that neural
operators-a flexible class of neural network-based approximators-can achieve
arbitrarily small approximation errors, thus satisfying the conditions of our
stability theorems. Numerical experiments on two nonlinear benchmark systems-a
biological protein activator/repressor model and a micro-organism growth
Chemostat model-validate our theoretical results. In particular, our numerical
simulations confirm stability under approximate predictors, highlight the
strong generalization capabilities of neural operators, and demonstrate a
substantial computational speedup of up to 15x compared to a baseline
fixed-point method.

Abstract: We here report the development of a structure that shows the proteresis
phenomenon in more general setting and set out its philosophical implications.
In this case, the questions relate to how we are to interpret what will happen
in the future, and the procollection (the counterpart of recollection) of
not-yet-experienced phenomena that, when expressed, will be whatever has built
up in fully determinate form already, ahead of the event. If such a process
really exists, as our evidence confirms, not just as phenomenon but as a fact,
then a gap exists between the actualized form of the future and its concrete
expression when the event does happen. Such a fact, as hard to imagine as it
is, may be intelligible, even interpretable and susceptible to mathematical
and/or logical modeling. We build upon neglected theories and formulae that
present time in a way that makes our results interpretable. A proteretic device
is here described which shifts the input signal (event) to the future; and it
is an anticipatory structure. The proteretic characteristic of neurons should
also be capable of demonstration; and its neuronal behavior is possibly the
reason for the fast perception/thought processes in spite of slow behaving
neurons. That capacity may also account for why it is possible for animals
(including humans) to interact with the environment by slightly seeing (in the
sense of perceiving and/or sensing) the future. Exploiting this new proteretic
technology, faster computers and more efficient cellphones, among other things,
will be designed and built.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 控制屏障函数(CBFs)通常依赖完整状态信息，但在实际场景中往往只能获得部分状态信息，这限制了CBFs在现实世界中的应用。

Method: 通过在增强状态空间上制定屏障条件，联合训练安全控制器、观测器和CBF，并引入有效性条件来提供超出训练数据的正式安全保证。

Result: 通过多个案例研究证明了所提出方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架能够在部分观测场景下提供正式的安全保证，解决了传统CBFs依赖完整状态信息的局限性。

Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) provide a powerful framework for ensuring
safety in dynamical systems. However, their application typically relies on
full state information, which is often violated in real-world scenarios due to
the availability of partial state information. In this work, we propose a
neural network-based framework for the co-design of a safety controller,
observer, and CBF for partially observed continuous-time systems. By
formulating barrier conditions over an augmented state space, our approach
ensures safety without requiring bounded estimation errors or handcrafted
barrier functions. All components are jointly trained by formulating
appropriate loss functions, and we introduce a validity condition to provide
formal safety guarantees beyond the training data. Finally, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approach through several case studies.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理积分器链的安全关键控制时存在局限性，特别是在存在匹配和不匹配扰动的情况下，需要同时保证系统的鲁棒性和安全性。

Conclusion: 该框架在鲁棒性和安全关键性能之间建立了桥梁，克服了现有规定时间方法的局限性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel safety-critical control framework for a
chain of integrators subject to both matched and mismatched perturbations. The
core of our approach is a linear, time-varying state-feedback design that
simultaneously enforces stability and safety constraints. By integrating
backstepping techniques with a quadratic programming (QP) formulation, we
develop a systematic procedure to guarantee safety under time-varying gains. We
provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for the double integrator case, both in
the presence and absence of perturbations, and outline general proofs for
extending the methodology to higher-order chains of integrators. This proposed
framework thus bridges robustness and safety-critical performance, while
overcoming the limitations of existing prescribed-time approaches.

Conclusion: 结合语言框架和贝叶斯信号的信息设计模型能够更有效地影响接收者信念，LLM可作为人类行为的有效代理。

Abstract: Information design is typically studied through the lens of Bayesian
signaling, where signals shape beliefs based on their correlation with the true
state of the world. However, Behavioral Economics and Psychology emphasize that
human decision-making is more complex and can depend on how information is
framed. This paper formalizes a language-based notion of framing and bridges
this to the popular Bayesian-persuasion model. We model framing as a possibly
non-Bayesian, linguistic way to influence a receiver's belief, while a
signaling (or recommendation) scheme can further refine this belief in the
classic Bayesian way. A key challenge in systematically optimizing in this
framework is the vast space of possible framings and the difficulty of
predicting their effects on receivers. Based on growing evidence that Large
Language Models (LLMs) can effectively serve as proxies for human behavior, we
formulate a theoretical model based on access to a framing-to-belief oracle.
This model then enables us to precisely characterize when solely optimizing
framing or jointly optimizing framing and signaling is tractable. We
substantiate our theoretical analysis with an empirical algorithm that
leverages LLMs to (1) approximate the framing-to-belief oracle, and (2)
optimize over language space using a hill-climbing method. We apply this to two
marketing-inspired case studies and validate the effectiveness through
analytical and human evaluation.

Abstract: There has been significant recent progress in algorithms for approximation of
Nash equilibrium in large two-player zero-sum imperfect-information games and
exact computation of Nash equilibrium in multiplayer strategic-form games.
While counterfactual regret minimization and fictitious play are scalable to
large games and have convergence guarantees in two-player zero-sum games, they
do not guarantee convergence to Nash equilibrium in multiplayer games. We
present an approach for exact computation of Nash equilibrium in multiplayer
imperfect-information games that solves a quadratically-constrained program
based on a nonlinear complementarity problem formulation from the sequence-form
game representation. This approach capitalizes on recent advances for solving
nonconvex quadratic programs. Our algorithm is able to quickly solve
three-player Kuhn poker after removal of dominated actions. Of the available
algorithms in the Gambit software suite, only the logit quantal response
approach is successfully able to solve the game; however, the approach takes
longer than our algorithm and also involves a degree of approximation. Our
formulation also leads to a new approach for computing Nash equilibrium in
multiplayer strategic-form games which we demonstrate to outperform a previous
quadratically-constrained program formulation.

Abstract: Efficient coordination in multi-agent systems often incurs high communication
overhead or slow convergence rates, making scalable welfare optimization
difficult. We propose Single-Bit Coordination Dynamics for Pareto-Efficient
Outcomes (SBC-PE), a decentralized learning algorithm requiring only a
single-bit satisfaction signal per agent each round. Despite this extreme
efficiency, SBC-PE guarantees convergence to the exact optimal solution in
arbitrary finite games. We establish explicit regret bounds, showing expected
regret grows only logarithmically with the horizon, i.e., O(log T). Compared
with prior payoff-based or bandit-style rules, SBC-PE uniquely combines minimal
signaling, general applicability, and finite-time guarantees. These results
show scalable welfare optimization is achievable under minimal communication
constraints.
