### [1] [Towards Efficient General Feature Prediction in Masked Skeleton Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03609)
*Shengkai Sun,Zefan Zhang,Jianfeng Dong,Zhiyong Cheng,Xiaojun Chang,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GFP框架，用高级特征预测替代传统低级坐标重建，实现高效骨架动作识别


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MAE方法局限于原始关节坐标重建，导致计算冗余和语义表示有限

Method: 使用轻量级目标生成网络动态产生多样化监督信号，采用约束优化确保特征多样性

Result: 训练速度提升6.2倍，在NTU RGB+D 60/120和PKU-MMD数据集上达到SOTA性能

Conclusion: GFP框架通过高级特征预测显著提升计算效率和表示质量，为骨架动作识别提供新范式

Abstract: Recent advances in the masked autoencoder (MAE) paradigm have significantly
propelled self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition. However, most
existing approaches limit reconstruction targets to raw joint coordinates or
their simple variants, resulting in computational redundancy and limited
semantic representation. To address this, we propose a novel General Feature
Prediction framework (GFP) for efficient mask skeleton modeling. Our key
innovation is replacing conventional low-level reconstruction with high-level
feature prediction that spans from local motion patterns to global semantic
representations. Specifically, we introduce a collaborative learning framework
where a lightweight target generation network dynamically produces diversified
supervision signals across spatial-temporal hierarchies, avoiding reliance on
pre-computed offline features. The framework incorporates constrained
optimization to ensure feature diversity while preventing model collapse.
Experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120 and PKU-MMD demonstrate the benefits
of our approach: Computational efficiency (with 6.2$\times$ faster training
than standard masked skeleton modeling methods) and superior representation
quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various downstream tasks.

TL;DR: 通过教师-学生模型统一解决有纳分裂检测和非典型有纳分裂分类任务，采用UNet分割背锁集成对比表征学习和域对抗训练来提高域逆移鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决有纳分裂计数中的人工耗时和观察者间变异性问题，并应对AI工具在域移植和数据不平衡情况下的性能下降挑战

Method: 基于UNet分割背锁的教师-学生模型，集成对比表征学习和域对抗训练，通过伪掩码生成技术提高特征辨别力，多任务学习范式中使用多尺度CNN分类器

Result: 在预测试集上达到Track 1 F1分数0.7660，Track 2平衡准确率0.8414

Conclusion: 统一的分割基于检测和分类框架能够有效提高有纳分裂分析的鲁棒性和性能

Abstract: Counting mitotic figures is time-intensive for pathologists and leads to
inter-observer variability. Artificial intelligence (AI) promises a solution by
automatically detecting mitotic figures while maintaining decision consistency.
However, AI tools are susceptible to domain shift, where a significant drop in
performance can occur due to differences in the training and testing sets,
including morphological diversity between organs, species, and variations in
staining protocols. Furthermore, the number of mitoses is much less than the
count of normal nuclei, which introduces severely imbalanced data for the
detection task. In this work, we formulate mitosis detection as a pixel-level
segmentation and propose a teacher-student model that simultaneously addresses
mitosis detection (Track 1) and atypical mitosis classification (Track 2). Our
method is based on a UNet segmentation backbone that integrates domain
generalization modules, namely contrastive representation learning and
domain-adversarial training. A teacher-student strategy is employed to generate
pixel-level pseudo-masks not only for annotated mitoses and hard negatives but
also for normal nuclei, thereby enhancing feature discrimination and improving
robustness against domain shift. For the classification task, we introduce a
multi-scale CNN classifier that leverages feature maps from the segmentation
model within a multi-task learning paradigm. On the preliminary test set, the
algorithm achieved an F1 score of 0.7660 in Track 1 and balanced accuracy of
0.8414 in Track 2, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating
segmentation-based detection and classification into a unified framework for
robust mitosis analysis.

### [3] [Multi Attribute Bias Mitigation via Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03616)
*Rajeev Ranjan Dwivedi,Ankur Kumar,Vinod K Kurmi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GMBM是一个两阶段框架，通过自适应偏置集成学习和梯度抑制微调，有效解决视觉模型中的多重偏置问题，无需测试时组标签，并在多个数据集上显著提升最差组准确率和降低偏置放大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界图像存在多重重叠偏置（纹理、水印、性别化妆、场景对象配对等），这些偏置会损害视觉模型的鲁棒性和公平性。单独处理每个偏置效果有限，因为缓解一个偏置往往会导致其他偏置加剧。

Method: 1. 自适应偏置集成学习（ABIL）：为每个属性训练编码器并与主干网络集成，强制分类器显式识别这些偏置
2. 梯度抑制微调：从主干网络的梯度中修剪偏置方向，留下一个忽略所有已识别捷径的紧凑网络
3. 引入缩放偏置放大（SBA）指标：在测试时分离模型引起的偏置放大与分布差异

Result: 在FB CMNIST、CelebA和COCO数据集上验证：
- 提升最差组准确率
- 将多属性偏置放大减半
- 在SBA指标上创下新低
- 即使偏置复杂性和分布偏移加剧仍有效

Conclusion: GMBM是第一个实用的端到端多重偏置解决方案，能够在训练时仅需组标签，测试时最小化偏置，为视觉识别提供了有效的多偏置缓解框架。

Abstract: Real world images frequently exhibit multiple overlapping biases, including
textures, watermarks, gendered makeup, scene object pairings, etc. These biases
collectively impair the performance of modern vision models, undermining both
their robustness and fairness. Addressing these biases individually proves
inadequate, as mitigating one bias often permits or intensifies others. We
tackle this multi bias problem with Generalized Multi Bias Mitigation (GMBM), a
lean two stage framework that needs group labels only while training and
minimizes bias at test time. First, Adaptive Bias Integrated Learning (ABIL)
deliberately identifies the influence of known shortcuts by training encoders
for each attribute and integrating them with the main backbone, compelling the
classifier to explicitly recognize these biases. Then Gradient Suppression Fine
Tuning prunes those very bias directions from the backbone's gradients, leaving
a single compact network that ignores all the shortcuts it just learned to
recognize. Moreover we find that existing bias metrics break under subgroup
imbalance and train test distribution shifts, so we introduce Scaled Bias
Amplification (SBA): a test time measure that disentangles model induced bias
amplification from distributional differences. We validate GMBM on FB CMNIST,
CelebA, and COCO, where we boost worst group accuracy, halve multi attribute
bias amplification, and set a new low in SBA even as bias complexity and
distribution shifts intensify, making GMBM the first practical, end to end
multibias solution for visual recognition. Project page:

### [4] [Lightweight image segmentation for echocardiography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03631)
*Anders Kjelsrud,Lasse Løvstakken,Erik Smistad,Håvard Dalen,Gilles Van De Vyver*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过缩减nnU-Net模型的复杂度，发展了一种轻量级U-Net模型，在保持心臀分割精度的同时大大提升了运行速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然nnU-Net在心臀分割任务上表现良好，但模型过大过慢，限制了实时应用的可能性。需要开发更轻量、更快速的模型来支持临床测量的自动化提取。

Method: 通过渣除研究分析nnU-Net的各个组件，评估了数据增帿方案、网络架构修改、损失函数和后处理技术的效果，确定了最有效的组合。

Result: 开发的轻量级U-Net模型参数量从33M降到2M，在CAMUS数据集上与nnU-Net表现统计等效（Dice分数相近，统计显著性p>0.05），模型大小减少16倍，速度提升4倍，并在跨数据集评估中保持了良好的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 简单的阿希增帿和深度监督是驱动性能的关键因素，而复杂增帿和大模型容量带来的收益逐渐减少。这个轻量级模型为实时心臀分割应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle in echocardiography can enable
fully automatic extraction of clinical measurements such as volumes and
ejection fraction. While models configured by nnU-Net perform well, they are
large and slow, thus limiting real-time use. We identified the most effective
components of nnU-Net for cardiac segmentation through an ablation study,
incrementally evaluating data augmentation schemes, architectural
modifications, loss functions, and post-processing techniques. Our analysis
revealed that simple affine augmentations and deep supervision drive
performance, while complex augmentations and large model capacity offer
diminishing returns. Based on these insights, we developed a lightweight U-Net
(2M vs 33M parameters) that achieves statistically equivalent performance to
nnU-Net on CAMUS (N=500) with Dice scores of 0.93/0.85/0.89 vs 0.93/0.86/0.89
for LV/MYO/LA ($p>0.05$), while being 16 times smaller and 4 times faster
(1.35ms vs 5.40ms per frame) than the default nnU-Net configuration.
Cross-dataset evaluation on an internal dataset (N=311) confirms comparable
generalization.

*Josafat-Mattias Burmeister,Andreas Tockner,Stefan Reder,Markus Engel,Rico Richter,Jan-Peter Mund,Jürgen Döllner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 改进版treeX算法，通过无监督聚类和区域生长方法实现高效树木分割，减少计算资源需求且提升了准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习方法需要大量标注数据和计算资源，需要一种资源效率更高的无监督方法来处理森林点云数据

Method: 改进版treeX算法，结合聚类基础的树干检测和区域生长的树冠划分方法，提供了地面扫描和UAV扫描两种参数预设

Result: 在6个公开数据集上评估，算法运行时间减少且准确性提升，地面数据F1分数提升0.11-0.49，ULS数据达到0.58F1分数

Conclusion: 该方法作为深度学习的资源效率替代方案，同时可用于半自动生成深度学习标签，已开源提供Python实现

Abstract: Close-range laser scanning provides detailed 3D captures of forest stands but
requires efficient software for processing 3D point cloud data and extracting
individual trees. Although recent studies have introduced deep learning methods
for tree instance segmentation, these approaches require large annotated
datasets and substantial computational resources. As a resource-efficient
alternative, we present a revised version of the treeX algorithm, an
unsupervised method that combines clustering-based stem detection with region
growing for crown delineation. While the original treeX algorithm was developed
for personal laser scanning (PLS) data, we provide two parameter presets, one
for ground-based laser scanning (stationary terrestrial - TLS and PLS), and one
for UAV-borne laser scanning (ULS). We evaluated the method on six public
datasets (FOR-instance, ForestSemantic, LAUTx, NIBIO MLS, TreeLearn, Wytham
Woods) and compared it to six open-source methods (original treeX, treeiso,
RayCloudTools, ForAINet, SegmentAnyTree, TreeLearn). Compared to the original
treeX algorithm, our revision reduces runtime and improves accuracy, with
instance detection F$_1$-score gains of +0.11 to +0.49 for ground-based data.
For ULS data, our preset achieves an F$_1$-score of 0.58, whereas the original
algorithm fails to segment any correct instances. For TLS and PLS data, our
algorithm achieves accuracy similar to recent open-source methods, including
deep learning. Given its algorithmic design, we see two main applications for
our method: (1) as a resource-efficient alternative to deep learning approaches
in scenarios where the data characteristics align with the method design
(sufficient stem visibility and point density), and (2) for the semi-automatic
generation of labels for deep learning models. To enable broader adoption, we
provide an open-source Python implementation in the pointtree package.

### [6] [Reg3D: Reconstructive Geometry Instruction Tuning for 3D Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03635)
*Hongpei Zheng,Lintao Xiang,Qijun Yang,Qian Lin,Hujun Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reg3D是一个创新的重建几何指令调优框架，通过将几何感知监督直接整合到训练过程中，解决了现有方法仅依赖文本监督的局限性，显著提升了3D场景理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型在2D视觉理解方面取得显著进展，但扩展到3D场景理解仍面临挑战。现有方法主要依赖纯文本监督，无法提供学习稳健3D空间表示所需的几何约束。

Method: Reg3D采用双监督范式，将3D几何信息同时作为输入和显式学习目标。设计了互补的对象级和帧级重建任务，在双编码器架构中强制执行几何一致性，促进空间推理能力的发展。

Result: 在ScanQA、Scan2Cap、ScanRefer和SQA3D等多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，Reg3D带来了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: Reg3D为空间感知多模态模型建立了一个新的训练范式，通过几何重建任务有效提升了3D理解能力。

Abstract: The rapid development of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has led to remarkable
progress in 2D visual understanding; however, extending these capabilities to
3D scene understanding remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches
predominantly rely on text-only supervision, which fails to provide the
geometric constraints required for learning robust 3D spatial representations.
In this paper, we introduce Reg3D, a novel Reconstructive Geometry Instruction
Tuning framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating geometry-aware
supervision directly into the training process. Our key insight is that
effective 3D understanding necessitates reconstructing underlying geometric
structures rather than merely describing them. Unlike existing methods that
inject 3D information solely at the input level, Reg3D adopts a
dual-supervision paradigm that leverages 3D geometric information both as input
and as explicit learning targets. Specifically, we design complementary
object-level and frame-level reconstruction tasks within a dual-encoder
architecture, enforcing geometric consistency to encourage the development of
spatial reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on ScanQA, Scan2Cap,
ScanRefer, and SQA3D demonstrate that Reg3D delivers substantial performance
improvements, establishing a new training paradigm for spatially aware
multimodal models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QuantV2X是首个完全量化的多模态多智能体V2X协同感知系统，通过统一端到端量化策略显著降低计算和传输成本，在保持精度的同时实现3.2倍延迟降低和9.5 mAP30提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有V2X协同感知研究主要关注精度指标，忽略了效率、延迟和实际部署等系统级考量，全精度模型计算和传输成本过高，难以在资源受限环境中实时运行。

Method: 提出QuantV2X系统，采用统一的端到端量化策略，同时对神经网络模型和传输消息表示进行量化，减少计算负载和传输带宽。

Result: 在低比特约束下达到与全精度系统相当的精度，系统级延迟降低3.2倍，mAP30提升9.5，能更有效地扩展模型规模以适应严格内存预算。

Conclusion: 完全量化的多智能体中间融合系统在实际部署中具有可行性，为V2X协同感知的实际应用提供了高效可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Cooperative perception through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication
offers significant potential for enhancing vehicle perception by mitigating
occlusions and expanding the field of view. However, past research has
predominantly focused on improving accuracy metrics without addressing the
crucial system-level considerations of efficiency, latency, and real-world
deployability. Noticeably, most existing systems rely on full-precision models,
which incur high computational and transmission costs, making them impractical
for real-time operation in resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we
introduce \textbf{QuantV2X}, the first fully quantized multi-agent system
designed specifically for efficient and scalable deployment of multi-modal,
multi-agent V2X cooperative perception. QuantV2X introduces a unified
end-to-end quantization strategy across both neural network models and
transmitted message representations that simultaneously reduces computational
load and transmission bandwidth. Remarkably, despite operating under low-bit
constraints, QuantV2X achieves accuracy comparable to full-precision systems.
More importantly, when evaluated under deployment-oriented metrics, QuantV2X
reduces system-level latency by 3.2$\times$ and achieves a +9.5 improvement in
mAP30 over full-precision baselines. Furthermore, QuantV2X scales more
effectively, enabling larger and more capable models to fit within strict
memory budgets. These results highlight the viability of a fully quantized
multi-agent intermediate fusion system for real-world deployment. The system
will be publicly released to promote research in this field:

TL;DR: 本研究评估了ResNet50、MobileNetV2和EfficientNetB0三种深度学习架构在基于叶脉模式的植物物种自动分类中的效果，发现EfficientNetB0表现最佳，测试准确率达到94.67%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 叶脉模式是植物分类中重要的形态学特征，本研究旨在探索深度学习模型在基于叶脉特征的植物物种自动分类中的应用潜力。

Method: 使用包含15个物种、1125张图像的瑞典叶片数据集，对ResNet50、MobileNetV2和EfficientNetB0三种深度学习模型进行训练和测试，采用标准性能指标进行评估。

Result: ResNet50训练准确率94.11%但存在过拟合，测试准确率88.45%；MobileNetV2测试准确率93.34%，泛化能力较好；EfficientNetB0表现最佳，测试准确率94.67%，各项指标均超过94.6%。

Conclusion: 深度学习特别是EfficientNetB0在基于叶脉特征的植物自动分类中具有巨大潜力，可开发出可扩展且准确的自动化分类工具。

Abstract: This study evaluates the efficacy of three deep learning architectures:
ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNetB0 for automated plant species
classification based on leaf venation patterns, a critical morphological
feature with high taxonomic relevance. Using the Swedish Leaf Dataset
comprising images from 15 distinct species (75 images per species, totalling
1,125 images), the models were demonstrated using standard performance metrics
during training and testing phases. ResNet50 achieved a training accuracy of
94.11% but exhibited overfitting, reflected by a reduced testing accuracy of
88.45% and an F1 score of 87.82%. MobileNetV2 demonstrated better
generalization capabilities, attaining a testing accuracy of 93.34% and an F1
score of 93.23%, indicating its suitability for lightweight, real-time
applications. EfficientNetB0 outperformed both models, achieving a testing
accuracy of 94.67% with precision, recall, and F1 scores exceeding 94.6%,
highlighting its robustness in venation-based classification. The findings
underscore the potential of deep learning, particularly EfficientNetB0, in
developing scalable and accurate tools for automated plant taxonomy using
venation traits.

*Casper van Engelenburg,Jan van Gemert,Seyran Khademi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayoutGKN是一种高效的图布局相似性计算方法，通过推迟跨图节点交互到嵌入架构末端，使用可微分图核作为距离函数，在保持或提升性能的同时显著提高计算速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图匹配网络依赖昂贵的中间跨图节点级交互，导致推理时间缓慢。需要一种更高效的方法来比较建筑布局图，以支持搜索、聚类和数据可视化等应用。

Method: 提出LayoutGKN方法，将跨图节点级交互推迟到联合嵌入架构的末端，使用可微分图核作为最终学习到的节点级嵌入的距离函数。

Result: LayoutGKN在计算相似性方面与图匹配网络相当或更好，同时显著提高了速度。

Conclusion: LayoutGKN提供了一种更高效的图布局比较方法，在保持性能的同时大幅提升计算效率，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Floor plans depict building layouts and are often represented as graphs to
capture the underlying spatial relationships. Comparison of these graphs is
critical for applications like search, clustering, and data visualization. The
most successful methods to compare graphs \ie, graph matching networks, rely on
costly intermediate cross-graph node-level interactions, therefore being slow
in inference time. We introduce \textbf{LayoutGKN}, a more efficient approach
that postpones the cross-graph node-level interactions to the end of the joint
embedding architecture. We do so by using a differentiable graph kernel as a
distance function on the final learned node-level embeddings. We show that
LayoutGKN computes similarity comparably or better than graph matching networks
while significantly increasing the speed.

### [10] [Singular Value Few-shot Adaptation of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03740)
*Taha Koleilat,Hassan Rivaz,Yiming Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP-SVD是一种新颖的多模态参数高效适应技术，通过奇异值分解(SVD)修改CLIP内部参数空间，仅需微调0.04%的参数就能实现领域适应，在11个自然和10个生物医学数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型(VLMs)如CLIP在新细粒度领域适应方面存在困难，依赖提示工程和全模型微调成本高，现有方法通过添加额外组件可能限制适应质量并破坏预训练知识。

Method: 利用奇异值分解(SVD)技术，仅微调CLIP参数矩阵的奇异值来重新缩放基向量进行领域适应，保持预训练模型结构不变，不注入额外模块。

Result: 在11个自然数据集和10个生物医学数据集上实现最先进的分类结果，在少样本设置下在准确性和泛化能力方面均优于先前方法，仅使用模型总参数的0.04%。

Conclusion: CLIP-SVD提供了一种参数高效的多模态适应方法，能够更好地保持模型的泛化能力，同时通过自然语言方法实现可解释性分析。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have shown impressive zero-shot and
few-shot learning capabilities across diverse applications. However, adapting
these models to new fine-grained domains remains difficult due to reliance on
prompt engineering and the high cost of full model fine-tuning. Existing
adaptation approaches rely on augmented components, such as prompt tokens and
adapter modules, which could limit adaptation quality, destabilize the model,
and compromise the rich knowledge learned during pretraining. In this work, we
present \textbf{CLIP-SVD}, a novel \textit{multi-modal} and
\textit{parameter-efficient} adaptation technique that leverages Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to modify the internal parameter space of CLIP without
injecting additional modules. Specifically, we fine-tune only the singular
values of the CLIP parameter matrices to rescale the basis vectors for domain
adaptation while retaining the pretrained model. This design enables enhanced
adaptation performance using only \textbf{0.04\%} of the model's total
parameters and better preservation of its generalization ability. CLIP-SVD
achieves state-of-the-art classification results on 11 natural and 10
biomedical datasets, outperforming previous methods in both accuracy and
generalization under few-shot settings. Additionally, we leverage a natural
language-based approach to analyze the effectiveness and dynamics of the CLIP
adaptation to allow interpretability of CLIP-SVD. The code is publicly
available at https://github.com/HealthX-Lab/CLIP-SVD.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了STA-Net模型，通过形状-纹理注意力模块(STAM)和训练免网络结构搜索(DeepMAD)，解决了边缘设备上植物病害诊断模型的轻量化问题，在CCMT数据集上达到了89.00%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精准农业和植物病害诊断需要高精度模型，但现有轻量网络的注意机制主要为通用物体识别设计，无法有效捐捕植物病害的缩微病理特征如不规则痕痕形状和复杂纹理。

Method: 1）使用训练免神经网络结构搜索方法(DeepMAD)构建高效边缘设备网络背榜
2）提出形状-纹理注意力模块(STAM)，将注意力分为两个分支：使用可变形卷积(DCNv4)的形状感知分支和使用Gabor滤波器的纹理感知分支

Result: 在CCMT植物病害数据集上，STA-Net模型(401K参数，51.1M FLOPs)达到了89.00%的准确率和88.96%的F1分数。消融实验证明STAM显著提升了基准模型和标准注意力模型的性能。

Conclusion: 通过解耦注意力机制集成领域知识，为边缘部署的精准农业AI提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Responding to rising global food security needs, precision agriculture and
deep learning-based plant disease diagnosis have become crucial. Yet, deploying
high-precision models on edge devices is challenging. Most lightweight networks
use attention mechanisms designed for generic object recognition, which poorly
capture subtle pathological features like irregular lesion shapes and complex
textures. To overcome this, we propose a twofold solution: first, using a
training-free neural architecture search method (DeepMAD) to create an
efficient network backbone for edge devices; second, introducing the
Shape-Texture Attention Module (STAM). STAM splits attention into two branches
-- one using deformable convolutions (DCNv4) for shape awareness and the other
using a Gabor filter bank for texture awareness. On the public CCMT plant
disease dataset, our STA-Net model (with 401K parameters and 51.1M FLOPs)
reached 89.00% accuracy and an F1 score of 88.96%. Ablation studies confirm
STAM significantly improves performance over baseline and standard attention
models. Integrating domain knowledge via decoupled attention thus presents a
promising path for edge-deployed precision agriculture AI. The source code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了水下伪装目标检测任务(UCOD)和DeepCamo基准数据集，开发了SLENet框架，通过Gamma-Asymmetric Enhancement模块和Localization Guidance Branch提升多尺度特征表示，在多个数据集上验证了优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下伪装目标检测对海洋生态学至关重要，但现有研究不足，且受到光学畸变、水体浑浊和海洋生物复杂特性的严重阻碍。

Method: 提出SLENet框架，包含GAE模块增强多尺度特征，LGB分支生成富含全局语义信息的位置图，MSSD解码器进行多尺度监督预测。

Result: 在DeepCamo数据集和三个基准COD数据集上的实验表明，SLENet优于现有最先进方法，并展现出对更广泛COD任务的高泛化性。

Conclusion: SLENet为解决水下伪装目标检测挑战提供了有效解决方案，其创新架构和模块设计显著提升了检测精度和泛化能力。

Abstract: Underwater Camouflaged Object Detection (UCOD) aims to identify objects that
blend seamlessly into underwater environments. This task is critically
important to marine ecology. However, it remains largely underexplored and
accurate identification is severely hindered by optical distortions, water
turbidity, and the complex traits of marine organisms. To address these
challenges, we introduce the UCOD task and present DeepCamo, a benchmark
dataset designed for this domain. We also propose Semantic Localization and
Enhancement Network (SLENet), a novel framework for UCOD. We first benchmark
state-of-the-art COD models on DeepCamo to reveal key issues, upon which SLENet
is built. In particular, we incorporate Gamma-Asymmetric Enhancement (GAE)
module and a Localization Guidance Branch (LGB) to enhance multi-scale feature
representation while generating a location map enriched with global semantic
information. This map guides the Multi-Scale Supervised Decoder (MSSD) to
produce more accurate predictions. Experiments on our DeepCamo dataset and
three benchmark COD datasets confirm SLENet's superior performance over SOTA
methods, and underscore its high generality for the broader COD task.

Result: 在HandCo数据集上，方法将收敛速度提高了2倍以上，在训练和验证集上都获得了更低的FID指标，同时提升了生成的多样性

Conclusion: 该方法通过减小梯度方差来加速收敛，能够更好地捐换时间变化的语义信息，为滿散模型训练提供了一种有效的正则化方法

Abstract: Image diffusion models are trained on independently sampled static images.
While this is the bedrock task protocol in generative modeling, capturing the
temporal world through the lens of static snapshots is information-deficient by
design. This limitation leads to slower convergence, limited distributional
coverage, and reduced generalization. In this work, we propose a simple and
effective training strategy that leverages the temporal inductive bias present
in continuous video frames to improve diffusion training. Notably, the proposed
method requires no architectural modification and can be seamlessly integrated
into standard diffusion training pipelines. We evaluate our method on the
HandCo dataset, where hand-object interactions exhibit dense temporal coherence
and subtle variations in finger articulation often result in semantically
distinct motions. Empirically, our method accelerates convergence by over
2$\text{x}$ faster and achieves lower FID on both training and validation
distributions. It also improves generative diversity by encouraging the model
to capture meaningful temporal variations. We further provide an optimization
analysis showing that our regularization reduces the gradient variance, which
contributes to faster convergence.

TL;DR: MedVista3D是一个用于3D CT分析的多尺度语义增强视觉语言预训练框架，通过局部和全局图像文本对齐来解决放射诊断中的漏读错误和沟通失败问题，在多项任务上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射诊断错误（漏读错误、注意力盲区和沟通失败）在临床实践中仍然普遍存在，特别是在3D成像中，医生需要检查数百个切片。现有3D视觉语言模型无法同时满足局部检测、全局推理和语义一致报告的需求。

Method: MedVista3D采用多尺度语义增强视觉语言预训练框架，进行局部和全局图像文本对齐以实现细粒度表示学习。通过语言模型重写和引入放射学语义匹配库来解决报告变异性问题。

Result: MedVista3D在零样本疾病分类、报告检索和医学视觉问答方面达到最先进性能，同时在器官分割和预后预测任务上表现出良好的迁移能力。

Conclusion: MedVista3D通过联合局部-全局理解和语义感知对齐，有效解决了3D放射诊断中的关键挑战，为临床实践提供了强大的辅助诊断工具。

Abstract: Radiologic diagnostic errors-under-reading errors, inattentional blindness,
and communication failures-remain prevalent in clinical practice. These issues
often stem from missed localized abnormalities, limited global context, and
variability in report language. These challenges are amplified in 3D imaging,
where clinicians must examine hundreds of slices per scan. Addressing them
requires systems with precise localized detection, global volume-level
reasoning, and semantically consistent natural language reporting. However,
existing 3D vision-language models are unable to meet all three needs jointly,
lacking local-global understanding for spatial reasoning and struggling with
the variability and noise of uncurated radiology reports. We present
MedVista3D, a multi-scale semantic-enriched vision-language pretraining
framework for 3D CT analysis. To enable joint disease detection and holistic
interpretation, MedVista3D performs local and global image-text alignment for
fine-grained representation learning within full-volume context. To address
report variability, we apply language model rewrites and introduce a Radiology
Semantic Matching Bank for semantics-aware alignment. MedVista3D achieves
state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot disease classification, report
retrieval, and medical visual question answering, while transferring well to
organ segmentation and prognosis prediction. Code and datasets will be
released.

*Mengyu Gao,Qiulei Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaPL是一种基于因果推理的视觉粒度化提示学习方法，通过属性解耦和粒度学习模块，显著提升了CLIP在细粒度识别任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CLIP提示学习方法在处理细粒度数据集时能力有限，需要一种能够捕捉类别间细微差异的方法。

Method: 提出两个模块：1）属性解耦模块使用布朗桥扩散模型分解视觉特征；2）粒度学习模块整合属性构建视觉粒度，采用两种因果推理策略进行识别。

Result: 在15个数据集上的实验表明，CaPL方法显著优于最先进的提示学习方法，特别是在细粒度数据集上表现突出。

Conclusion: 通过视觉粒度化和因果推理，CaPL能够学习更具判别性的文本提示，有效提升CLIP在细粒度识别任务中的性能。

Abstract: Prompt learning has recently attracted much attention for adapting
pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) to downstream recognition
tasks. However, most of the existing CLIP-based prompt learning methods only
show a limited ability for handling fine-grained datasets. To address this
issue, we propose a causality-guided text prompt learning method via visual
granulation for CLIP, called CaPL, where the explored visual granulation
technique could construct sets of visual granules for the text prompt to
capture subtle discrepancies among different fine-grained classes through
casual inference. The CaPL method contains the following two modules: (1) An
attribute disentanglement module is proposed to decompose visual features into
non-individualized attributes (shared by some classes) and individualized
attributes (specific to single classes) using a Brownian Bridge Diffusion
Model; (2) A granule learning module is proposed to construct visual granules
by integrating the aforementioned attributes for recognition under two causal
inference strategies. Thanks to the learned visual granules, more
discriminative text prompt is expected to be learned. Extensive experimental
results on 15 datasets demonstrate that our CaPL method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art prompt learning methods, especially on
fine-grained datasets.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于事件相机的激光回水渗透减少技术，通过事件流的逆时空分布提取可靠的无激光回水渗透引导，实现了超过现有SOTA方法710倍的效率提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习激光回水渗透减少方法需要高容量网络学习粗粒度的激光回水渗透动力学，计算和存储效率低。事件相机具有微秒级别的时间分辨率，可以根本解决这个瓶颈

Method: 提出了"事件幸运见解"，揭示激光回水渗透扭曲与事件流逆时空分布的相关性，并构建了EGTM框架，从噪声事件中提取像素级可靠的无激光回水渗透引导进行时间幸运融合

Result: 在真实世界EGTM数据集上达到了最高的恢复质量（+0.94 PSNR和+0.08 SSIM），模型大小、推理延迟和模型复杂度分别次过现有SOTA方法710倍、214倍和224倍

Conclusion: 这个工作证明了在激光回水渗透减少任务中引入事件模态的巨大效率优势，为高效激光回水渗透减少提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Turbulence mitigation (TM) aims to remove the stochastic distortions and
blurs introduced by atmospheric turbulence into frame cameras. Existing
state-of-the-art deep-learning TM methods extract turbulence cues from multiple
degraded frames to find the so-called "lucky'', not distorted patch, for "lucky
fusion''. However, it requires high-capacity network to learn from
coarse-grained turbulence dynamics between synchronous frames with limited
frame-rate, thus fall short in computational and storage efficiency. Event
cameras, with microsecond-level temporal resolution, have the potential to
fundamentally address this bottleneck with efficient sparse and asynchronous
imaging mechanism. In light of this, we (i) present the fundamental
\textbf{``event-lucky insight''} to reveal the correlation between turbulence
distortions and inverse spatiotemporal distribution of event streams. Then,
build upon this insight, we (ii) propose a novel EGTM framework that extracts
pixel-level reliable turbulence-free guidance from the explicit but noisy
turbulent events for temporal lucky fusion. Moreover, we (iii) build the first
turbulence data acquisition system to contribute the first real-world
event-driven TM dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly surpass the existing SOTA TM method by 710 times, 214
times and 224 times in model size, inference latency and model complexity
respectively, while achieving the state-of-the-art in restoration quality
(+0.94 PSNR and +0.08 SSIM) on our real-world EGTM dataset. This demonstrating
the great efficiency merit of introducing event modality into TM task. Demo
code and data have been uploaded in supplementary material and will be released
once accepted.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FocusMamba通过事件引导的多模态稀疏化和跨模态聚焦融合，自适应地丢弃RGB和事件数据中的低信息区域，在目标检测任务中实现了精度和效率的更好平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RGB-事件检测方法在处理两种模态的低信息区域（图像背景和事件数据中的非事件区域）时采用统一处理方式，导致计算成本高且性能不佳。需要一种自适应的方法来减少计算冗余。

Method: 提出FocusMamba方法：1）事件引导多模态稀疏化(EGMS)策略，利用事件相机感知的场景变化来自适应识别和丢弃各模态中的低信息区域；2）跨模态聚焦融合(CMFF)模块，基于稀疏化结果有效捕获和整合两种模态的互补特征。

Result: 在DSEC-Det和PKU-DAVIS-SOD数据集上的实验表明，该方法在准确性和效率方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FocusMamba通过自适应协作稀疏化和高效融合策略，成功解决了RGB-事件检测中的计算冗余问题，实现了精度和效率的双重提升。

Abstract: Existing RGB-Event detection methods process the low-information regions of
both modalities (background in images and non-event regions in event data)
uniformly during feature extraction and fusion, resulting in high computational
costs and suboptimal performance. To mitigate the computational redundancy
during feature extraction, researchers have respectively proposed token
sparsification methods for the image and event modalities. However, these
methods employ a fixed number or threshold for token selection, hindering the
retention of informative tokens for samples with varying complexity. To achieve
a better balance between accuracy and efficiency, we propose FocusMamba, which
performs adaptive collaborative sparsification of multimodal features and
efficiently integrates complementary information. Specifically, an Event-Guided
Multimodal Sparsification (EGMS) strategy is designed to identify and
adaptively discard low-information regions within each modality by leveraging
scene content changes perceived by the event camera. Based on the
sparsification results, a Cross-Modality Focus Fusion (CMFF) module is proposed
to effectively capture and integrate complementary features from both
modalities. Experiments on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate
that the proposed method achieves superior performance in both accuracy and
efficiency compared to existing methods. The code will be available at

Motivation: 传统食物识别方法难以处理新出现的菜品类别，需要零样本学习能力。组合零样本学习中的属性和对象概念与菜系和食材自然对应，适合食物识别任务

Method: SalientFusion方法包含两个组件：SalientFormer去除背景冗余并利用深度特征解决角色混淆；DebiasAT通过对齐提示词与视觉特征减少语义偏差

Result: 在新建的CZSFood-90和CZSFood-164基准数据集上取得最优性能，同时在通用CZSL数据集上也达到最先进水平

Conclusion: 提出的CZSFR任务和SalientFusion方法有效解决了食物识别中的零样本学习挑战，为食物识别领域提供了新的研究方向

Abstract: Food recognition has gained significant attention, but the rapid emergence of
new dishes requires methods for recognizing unseen food categories, motivating
Zero-Shot Food Learning (ZSFL). We propose the task of Compositional Zero-Shot
Food Recognition (CZSFR), where cuisines and ingredients naturally align with
attributes and objects in Compositional Zero-Shot learning (CZSL). However,
CZSFR faces three challenges: (1) Redundant background information distracts
models from learning meaningful food features, (2) Role confusion between
staple and side dishes leads to misclassification, and (3) Semantic bias in a
single attribute can lead to confusion of understanding. Therefore, we propose
SalientFusion, a context-aware CZSFR method with two components: SalientFormer,
which removes background redundancy and uses depth features to resolve role
confusion; DebiasAT, which reduces the semantic bias by aligning prompts with
visual features. Using our proposed benchmarks, CZSFood-90 and CZSFood-164, we
show that SalientFusion achieves state-of-the-art results on these benchmarks
and the most popular general datasets for the general CZSL. The code is
avaliable at https://github.com/Jiajun-RUC/SalientFusion.

over ten sub-tasks, and detailing the five key phases of the generation
process: input, motion planning, motion video generation, refinement, and
output. Notably, this is the first survey that discusses the potential of large
language models in enhancing human motion video generation. Our survey reviews
the latest developments and technological trends in human motion video
generation across three primary modalities: vision, text, and audio. By
covering over two hundred papers, we offer a thorough overview of the field and
highlight milestone works that have driven significant technological
breakthroughs. Our goal for this survey is to unveil the prospects of human
motion video generation and serve as a valuable resource for advancing the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自回归方法在占用世界建模中存在效率低下、长期生成时出现时间退化以及缺乏可控性等问题，需要一种新的方法来同时解决这些挑战。

Method: 提出时间下一尺度预测(TENS)任务，将时间序列建模分解为空间尺度生成和时间场景预测；使用TensFormer有效管理时间因果关系和空间关系；采用整体姿态聚合策略实现占用和自运动的统一序列建模。

Result: 实验表明OccTENS在占用质量和推理时间方面均优于最先进方法，实现了更高的生成质量和更快的推理速度。

Conclusion: OccTENS通过创新的时间下一尺度预测框架，成功解决了占用世界建模中的效率、长期生成质量和可控性问题，为3D场景的生成式建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose OccTENS, a generative occupancy world model that
enables controllable, high-fidelity long-term occupancy generation while
maintaining computational efficiency. Different from visual generation, the
occupancy world model must capture the fine-grained 3D geometry and dynamic
evolution of the 3D scenes, posing great challenges for the generative models.
Recent approaches based on autoregression (AR) have demonstrated the potential
to predict vehicle movement and future occupancy scenes simultaneously from
historical observations, but they typically suffer from \textbf{inefficiency},
\textbf{temporal degradation} in long-term generation and \textbf{lack of
controllability}. To holistically address these issues, we reformulate the
occupancy world model as a temporal next-scale prediction (TENS) task, which
decomposes the temporal sequence modeling problem into the modeling of spatial
scale-by-scale generation and temporal scene-by-scene prediction. With a
\textbf{TensFormer}, OccTENS can effectively manage the temporal causality and
spatial relationships of occupancy sequences in a flexible and scalable way. To
enhance the pose controllability, we further propose a holistic pose
aggregation strategy, which features a unified sequence modeling for occupancy
and ego-motion. Experiments show that OccTENS outperforms the state-of-the-art
method with both higher occupancy quality and faster inference time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在不同类别物体之间建立密集对应关系对于形状重建和机器人操作等任务至关重要。物体功能（即物体对其他物体产生的影响）可以指导对应关系的建立，因为实现特定功能的物体部件通常在形状和外观上具有相似性。

Method: 提出弱监督学习范式：1）利用视觉语言模型对多视角图像进行伪标注获取功能部件；2）结合密集对比学习从像素对应关系中提取功能和空间知识；3）将这两种知识蒸馏到一个新模型中，用于建立密集功能对应关系。

Result: 构建了合成和真实评估数据集作为任务基准，实验结果表明该方法优于基于现成自监督图像表示和基础视觉语言模型的基线解决方案。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将功能知识融入密集对应关系学习中，在跨类别物体匹配任务中表现出优越性能，为形状重建和机器人操作等应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Establishing dense correspondences across image pairs is essential for tasks
such as shape reconstruction and robot manipulation. In the challenging setting
of matching across different categories, the function of an object, i.e., the
effect that an object can cause on other objects, can guide how correspondences
should be established. This is because object parts that enable specific
functions often share similarities in shape and appearance. We derive the
definition of dense functional correspondence based on this observation and
propose a weakly-supervised learning paradigm to tackle the prediction task.
The main insight behind our approach is that we can leverage vision-language
models to pseudo-label multi-view images to obtain functional parts. We then
integrate this with dense contrastive learning from pixel correspondences to
distill both functional and spatial knowledge into a new model that can
establish dense functional correspondence. Further, we curate synthetic and
real evaluation datasets as task benchmarks. Our results demonstrate the
advantages of our approach over baseline solutions consisting of off-the-shelf
self-supervised image representations and grounded vision language models.

Conclusion: Attn-Adapter通过在线少样本学习框架有效解决了CLIP在少样本场景下的适应性问题，避免了重新训练基础模型的需求

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models excel in zero-shot image recognition but
face challenges in few-shot scenarios due to computationally intensive offline
fine-tuning using prompt learning, which risks overfitting. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Attn-Adapter, a novel online few-shot learning
framework that enhances CLIP's adaptability via a dual attention mechanism. Our
design incorporates dataset-specific information through two components: the
Memory Attn-Adapter, which refines category embeddings using support examples,
and the Local-Global Attn-Adapter, which enriches image embeddings by
integrating local and global features. This architecture enables dynamic
adaptation from a few labeled samples without retraining the base model.
Attn-Adapter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-category and
cross-dataset generalization, maintaining efficient inference and scaling
across CLIP backbones.

Conclusion: 结论证明通过结合多个YOLO架构和融合多光谱数据，可以提供更可靠的解决方案，显著改善了可见光和热成像缺陷的检测效果

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with advanced sensors have opened up
new opportunities for monitoring wind power plants, including blades, towers,
and other critical components. However, reliable defect detection requires
high-resolution data and efficient methods to process multispectral imagery. In
this research, we aim to enhance defect detection accuracy through the
development of an ensemble of YOLO-based deep learning models that integrate
both visible and thermal channels. We propose an ensemble approach that
integrates a general-purpose YOLOv8 model with a specialized thermal model,
using a sophisticated bounding box fusion algorithm to combine their
predictions. Our experiments show this approach achieves a mean Average
Precision (mAP@.5) of 0.93 and an F1-score of 0.90, outperforming a standalone
YOLOv8 model, which scored an mAP@.5 of 0.91. These findings demonstrate that
combining multiple YOLO architectures with fused multispectral data provides a
more reliable solution, improving the detection of both visual and thermal
defects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标存在问题：n-gram指标无法捕捉语义正确性，表示相似性指标计算成本高且与人类判断相关性低，LLM指标虽相关性强但过于昂贵，不适合模型开发中的迭代使用。

Method: 提出SPECS指标，基于CLIP模型进行改进，通过新的目标函数强调特异性：奖励正确细节并惩罚错误细节，专门针对长图像描述任务设计。

Result: SPECS在相关性方面与开源LLM指标相当，但计算效率大幅提升，使其成为图像描述模型开发中实用的迭代评估工具。

Conclusion: SPECS提供了一个既高效又与人类判断高度相关的评估方案，解决了长图像描述评估中的关键问题，为模型开发提供了实用的评估工具。

Abstract: As interest grows in generating long, detailed image captions, standard
evaluation metrics become increasingly unreliable. N-gram-based metrics though
efficient, fail to capture semantic correctness. Representational Similarity
(RS) metrics, designed to address this, initially saw limited use due to high
computational costs, while today, despite advances in hardware, they remain
unpopular due to low correlation to human judgments. Meanwhile, metrics based
on large language models (LLMs) show strong correlation with human judgments,
but remain too expensive for iterative use during model development.
  We introduce SPECS (Specificity-Enhanced CLIPScore), a reference-free RS
metric tailored to long image captioning. SPECS modifies CLIP with a new
objective that emphasizes specificity: rewarding correct details and penalizing
incorrect ones. We show that SPECS matches the performance of open-source
LLM-based metrics in correlation to human judgments, while being far more
efficient. This makes it a practical alternative for iterative checkpoint
evaluation during image captioning model development.Our code can be found at

Abstract: The scarcity of well-annotated diverse medical images is a major hurdle for
developing reliable AI models in healthcare. Substantial technical advances
have been made in generative foundation models for natural images. Here we
develop `ChexGen', a generative vision-language foundation model that
introduces a unified framework for text-, mask-, and bounding box-guided
synthesis of chest radiographs. Built upon the latent diffusion transformer
architecture, ChexGen was pretrained on the largest curated chest X-ray dataset
to date, consisting of 960,000 radiograph-report pairs. ChexGen achieves
accurate synthesis of radiographs through expert evaluations and quantitative
metrics. We demonstrate the utility of ChexGen for training data augmentation
and supervised pretraining, which led to performance improvements across
disease classification, detection, and segmentation tasks using a small
fraction of training data. Further, our model enables the creation of diverse
patient cohorts that enhance model fairness by detecting and mitigating
demographic biases. Our study supports the transformative role of generative
foundation models in building more accurate, data-efficient, and equitable
medical AI systems.

Conclusion: 该框架为多视角视频编码建立了强有力的基线，支持随机访问和后向兼容性，同时提升压缩效率

Abstract: Multiview video is a key data source for volumetric video, enabling immersive
3D scene reconstruction but posing significant challenges in storage and
transmission due to its massive data volume. Recently, deep learning-based
end-to-end video coding has achieved great success, yet most focus on
single-view or stereo videos, leaving general multiview scenarios
underexplored. This paper proposes an end-to-end learned multiview video coding
(LMVC) framework that ensures random access and backward compatibility while
enhancing compression efficiency. Our key innovation lies in effectively
leveraging independent-view motion and content information to enhance
dependent-view compression. Specifically, to exploit the inter-view motion
correlation, we propose a feature-based inter-view motion vector prediction
method that conditions dependent-view motion encoding on decoded
independent-view motion features, along with an inter-view motion entropy model
that learns inter-view motion priors. To exploit the inter-view content
correlation, we propose a disparity-free inter-view context prediction module
that predicts inter-view contexts from decoded independent-view content
features, combined with an inter-view contextual entropy model that captures
inter-view context priors. Experimental results show that our proposed LMVC
framework outperforms the reference software of the traditional MV-HEVC
standard by a large margin, establishing a strong baseline for future research
in this field.

*Minghui Zhang,Yaoyu Liu,Junyang Wu,Xin You,Hanxiao Zhang,Junjun He,Yun Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TopoSculpt是一个用于3D细粒度管状结构拓扑优化的框架，通过整体区域建模、拓扑完整性约束和课程细化方案，显著改善了医学管状解剖结构重建的几何和拓扑准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的医学管状结构重建方法主要依赖体素重叠度量，无法保证拓扑正确性和完整性。虽然拓扑感知损失和持久同调约束有潜力，但通常只能局部应用，无法保证全局拓扑保持和推理时的几何错误修正。

Method: TopoSculpt采用整体区域建模策略捕获完整空间上下文；首次引入拓扑完整性Betti约束，联合执行Betti数先验和全局完整性；采用持久同调的课程细化方案，从粗到细逐步修正错误。

Result: 在肺气道和Willis环数据集上的实验显示显著改进：β₀错误从69.00降至3.40（气道）和1.65降至0.30（CoW），树长检测和分支检测率提升近10%。

Conclusion: TopoSculpt能有效修正关键拓扑错误，推进复杂3D管状解剖结构的高保真建模，在几何和拓扑准确性方面都有显著提升。

Abstract: Medical tubular anatomical structures are inherently three-dimensional
conduits with lumens, enclosing walls, and complex branching topologies.
Accurate reconstruction of their geometry and topology is crucial for
applications such as bronchoscopic navigation and cerebral arterial
connectivity assessment. Existing methods often rely on voxel-wise overlap
measures, which fail to capture topological correctness and completeness.
Although topology-aware losses and persistent homology constraints have shown
promise, they are usually applied patch-wise and cannot guarantee global
preservation or correct geometric errors at inference. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel TopoSculpt, a framework for topological
refinement of 3D fine-grained tubular structures. TopoSculpt (i) adopts a
holistic whole-region modeling strategy to capture full spatial context, (ii)
first introduces a Topological Integrity Betti (TIB) constraint that jointly
enforces Betti number priors and global integrity, and (iii) employs a
curriculum refinement scheme with persistent homology to progressively correct
errors from coarse to fine scales. Extensive experiments on challenging
pulmonary airway and Circle of Willis datasets demonstrate substantial
improvements in both geometry and topology. For instance, $\beta_{0}$ errors
are reduced from 69.00 to 3.40 on the airway dataset and from 1.65 to 0.30 on
the CoW dataset, with Tree length detected and branch detected rates improving
by nearly 10\%. These results highlight the effectiveness of TopoSculpt in
correcting critical topological errors and advancing the high-fidelity modeling
of complex 3D tubular anatomy. The project homepage is available at:

Abstract: Pneumothorax, the abnormal accumulation of air in the pleural space, can be
life-threatening if undetected. Chest X-rays are the first-line diagnostic
tool, but small cases may be subtle. We propose an automated deep-learning
pipeline using a U-Net with an EfficientNet-B4 encoder to segment pneumothorax
regions. Trained on the SIIM-ACR dataset with data augmentation and a combined
binary cross-entropy plus Dice loss, the model achieved an IoU of 0.7008 and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过多模态大语言模型构建自适应性负面文本空间(ANTS)，提升距离分布检测的远距和近距性能，在ImageNet上实现了新的SOTA结果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有负面标签方法对距离分布图像理解不深入，构建的负面空间不准确，并且假负面标签会严重影响近距OOD检测性能

Method: 利用MLLMs的理解和推理能力：1)识别OOD样本并生成表达性负面句子提升远距检测；2)为视觉相似的ID类生成局部负面标签减少假负面；3)设计自适应权重分数平衡两种负面空间

Result: 在ImageNet基准测试中，ANTS显著降低了FPR95指4.2%，创造了新的最高水平，方法无需训练且支持零样本扩展

Conclusion: 通过MLLMs的理解和推理能力构建自适应性负面文本空间，有效解决了远距和近距OOD检测的挑战，具有高可扩展性和强适应性

Abstract: The introduction of negative labels (NLs) has proven effective in enhancing
Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. However, existing methods often lack an
understanding of OOD images, making it difficult to construct an accurate
negative space. In addition, the presence of false negative labels
significantly degrades their near-OOD performance. To address these issues, we
propose shaping an Adaptive Negative Textual Space (ANTS) by leveraging the
understanding and reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Specifically, we identify images likely to be OOD samples as negative
images and prompt the MLLM to describe these images, generating expressive
negative sentences that precisely characterize the OOD distribution and enhance
far-OOD detection. For the near-OOD setting, where OOD samples resemble the
in-distribution (ID) subset, we first identify the subset of ID classes that
are visually similar to negative images and then leverage the reasoning
capability of MLLMs to generate visually similar negative labels tailored to
this subset, effectively reducing false negatives and improving near-OOD
detection. To balance these two types of negative textual spaces, we design an
adaptive weighted score that enables the method to handle different OOD task
settings (near-OOD and far-OOD) without relying on task-specific prior
knowledge, making it highly adaptable in open environments. On the ImageNet
benchmark, our ANTS significantly reduces the FPR95 by 4.2\%, establishing a
new state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our method is training-free and zero-shot,
enabling high scalability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法仅依赖图像模态，在光照和噪声干扰下特征表示有限，变化模式建模和泛化能力不足

Method: 提出Image Feature Refinement模块突出关键区域并抑制噪声；使用视觉语言模型生成语义描述；Textual Difference Enhancement模块捕捉细粒度语义变化；Image-Text Feature Fusion模块实现深度跨模态融合

Result: 在LEVIRCD、WHUCD和SYSUCD数据集上的大量实验表明，MMChange在多个指标上持续超越最先进方法

Conclusion: 该方法验证了多模态融合在遥感变化检测中的有效性，能够显著提升准确性和鲁棒性

Abstract: Although deep learning has advanced remote sensing change detection (RSCD),
most methods rely solely on image modality, limiting feature representation,
change pattern modeling, and generalization especially under illumination and
noise disturbances. To address this, we propose MMChange, a multimodal RSCD
method that combines image and text modalities to enhance accuracy and
robustness. An Image Feature Refinement (IFR) module is introduced to highlight
key regions and suppress environmental noise. To overcome the semantic
limitations of image features, we employ a vision language model (VLM) to
generate semantic descriptions of bitemporal images. A Textual Difference
Enhancement (TDE) module then captures fine grained semantic shifts, guiding
the model toward meaningful changes. To bridge the heterogeneity between
modalities, we design an Image Text Feature Fusion (ITFF) module that enables
deep cross modal integration. Extensive experiments on LEVIRCD, WHUCD, and
SYSUCD demonstrate that MMChange consistently surpasses state of the art
methods across multiple metrics, validating its effectiveness for multimodal
RSCD. Code is available at: https://github.com/yikuizhai/MMChange.

TL;DR: SAC-MIL是一种用于WSI分类的空间感知相关多实例学习方法，通过位置编码和全实例相关性计算，在多个数据集上达到最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决WSI分类中空间信息利用不足和计算复杂度高的问题，特别是Transformer方法需要定制CUDA内核的部署困难

Method: 包含位置编码模块（使用实例坐标而非序列索引）和SAC块（基于MLP的全实例相关性计算，线性时间复杂度）

Result: 在CAMELYON-16、TCGA-LUNG和TCGA-BRAC数据集上达到最先进性能

Conclusion: SAC-MIL提供了一种高效且易于部署的WSI分类方法，解决了序列长度外推问题，在保持高性能的同时降低了部署复杂度

Abstract: We propose Spatial-Aware Correlated Multiple Instance Learning (SAC-MIL) for
performing WSI classification. SAC-MIL consists of a positional encoding module
to encode position information and a SAC block to perform full instance
correlations. The positional encoding module utilizes the instance coordinates
within the slide to encode the spatial relationships instead of the instance
index in the input WSI sequence. The positional encoding module can also handle
the length extrapolation issue where the training and testing sequences have
different lengths. The SAC block is an MLP-based method that performs full
instance correlation in linear time complexity with respect to the sequence
length. Due to the simple structure of MLP, it is easy to deploy since it does
not require custom CUDA kernels, compared to Transformer-based methods for WSI
classification. SAC-MIL has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the
CAMELYON-16, TCGA-LUNG, and TCGA-BRAC datasets. The code will be released upon
acceptance.

Motivation: 解决无对比剂肝脏MRI血管分割挑战，因为对比增强成像序列并非均匀采集，而无对比剂成像更常见但需要大规模标注数据

Method: 多任务学习框架，利用训练期间可获取的成对原始和对比增强MRI数据（有无血管标注均可），通过共享任务结构改善特征表征

Result: 辅助数据显著提高了血管分割准确度，即使在推理时不可用。当训练标注数量少时效果更为明显，该方法在脑部肿瘤分割任务中也得到验证

Conclusion: 辅助信息成像模态可以在仅于训练期间可用的情况下增强专家标注的效果，为医学形态分析提供了有效的数据增强方法

Abstract: Liver vessel segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging data is important for
the computational analysis of vascular remodelling, associated with a wide
spectrum of diffuse liver diseases. Existing approaches rely on contrast
enhanced imaging data, but the necessary dedicated imaging sequences are not
uniformly acquired. Images without contrast enhancement are acquired more
frequently, but vessel segmentation is challenging, and requires large-scale
annotated data. We propose a multi-task learning framework to segment vessels
in liver MRI without contrast. It exploits auxiliary contrast enhanced MRI data
available only during training to reduce the need for annotated training
examples. Our approach draws on paired native and contrast enhanced data with
and without vessel annotations for model training. Results show that auxiliary
data improves the accuracy of vessel segmentation, even if they are not
available during inference. The advantage is most pronounced if only few
annotations are available for training, since the feature representation
benefits from the shared task structure. A validation of this approach to
augment a model for brain tumor segmentation confirms its benefits across
different domains. An auxiliary informative imaging modality can augment expert
annotations even if it is only available during training.

Motivation: 大型多模态模型在多项选择题回答中的提示设计缺乏系统研究，提示措辞的微小变化会导致显著的性能差异，这影响了模型评估的透明性和公平性。

Method: 提出了Promptception框架，包含61种提示类型、15个类别和6个超类别，用于评估10个不同规模的大型多模态模型在3个多项选择题基准测试上的表现。

Result: 研究发现专有模型对提示措辞更敏感，反映了与指令语义的更紧密对齐；开源模型更稳定但在复杂措辞上表现较差。提示敏感性最高可达15%的准确率差异。

Conclusion: 基于分析结果，为专有和开源大型多模态模型分别提出了针对性的提示原则，以实现更稳健和公平的模型评估。

Abstract: Despite the success of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in recent years, prompt
design for LMMs in Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) remains poorly
understood. We show that even minor variations in prompt phrasing and structure
can lead to accuracy deviations of up to 15% for certain prompts and models.
This variability poses a challenge for transparent and fair LMM evaluation, as
models often report their best-case performance using carefully selected
prompts. To address this, we introduce Promptception, a systematic framework
for evaluating prompt sensitivity in LMMs. It consists of 61 prompt types,
spanning 15 categories and 6 supercategories, each targeting specific aspects
of prompt formulation, and is used to evaluate 10 LMMs ranging from lightweight
open-source models to GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, across 3 MCQA benchmarks:
MMStar, MMMU-Pro, MVBench. Our findings reveal that proprietary models exhibit
greater sensitivity to prompt phrasing, reflecting tighter alignment with
instruction semantics, while open-source models are steadier but struggle with
nuanced and complex phrasing. Based on this analysis, we propose Prompting
Principles tailored to proprietary and open-source LMMs, enabling more robust
and fair model evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D语义占据预测方法在处理体素特征时忽视高度轴信息，传统通道注意力对所有高度层赋予相同权重，限制了不同高度特征的表达能力

Method: 使用全局和局部垂直切片提取体素特征，提出全局局部融合模块协调细粒度空间细节和整体上下文信息，设计SEAttention3D模块为每个高度层分配动态通道注意力权重

Result: 在nuScenes-SurroundOcc和nuScenes-OpenOccupancy数据集上显著提升平均IoU，特别是在小物体类别上获得明显增益

Conclusion: SliceSemOcc框架通过有效处理高度轴信息和动态通道注意力机制，显著提升了3D语义占据预测性能，特别是在小物体检测方面

Abstract: Driven by autonomous driving's demands for precise 3D perception, 3D semantic
occupancy prediction has become a pivotal research topic. Unlike
bird's-eye-view (BEV) methods, which restrict scene representation to a 2D
plane, occupancy prediction leverages a complete 3D voxel grid to model spatial
structures in all dimensions, thereby capturing semantic variations along the
vertical axis. However, most existing approaches overlook height-axis
information when processing voxel features. And conventional SENet-style
channel attention assigns uniform weight across all height layers, limiting
their ability to emphasize features at different heights. To address these
limitations, we propose SliceSemOcc, a novel vertical slice based multimodal
framework for 3D semantic occupancy representation. Specifically, we extract
voxel features along the height-axis using both global and local vertical
slices. Then, a global local fusion module adaptively reconciles fine-grained
spatial details with holistic contextual information. Furthermore, we propose
the SEAttention3D module, which preserves height-wise resolution through
average pooling and assigns dynamic channel attention weights to each height
layer. Extensive experiments on nuScenes-SurroundOcc and nuScenes-OpenOccupancy
datasets verify that our method significantly enhances mean IoU, achieving
especially pronounced gains on most small-object categories. Detailed ablation
studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed SliceSemOcc
framework.

Abstract: Due to their powerful feature association capabilities, neural network-based
computer vision models have the ability to detect and exploit unintended
patterns within the data, potentially leading to correct predictions based on
incorrect or unintended but statistically relevant signals. These clues may
vary from simple color aberrations to small texts within the image. In
situations where these unintended signals align with the predictive task,
models can mistakenly link these features with the task and rely on them for
making predictions. This phenomenon is referred to as spurious correlations,
where patterns appear to be associated with the task but are actually
coincidental. As a result, detection and mitigation of spurious correlations
have become crucial tasks for building trustworthy, reliable, and generalizable
machine learning models. In this work, we present a novel method to detect
spurious correlations in vision transformers, a type of neural network
architecture that gained significant popularity in recent years. Using both
supervised and self-supervised trained models, we present large-scale
experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrating the ability of the proposed
method to identify spurious correlations. We also find that, even if the same
architecture is used, the training methodology has a significant impact on the
model's reliance on spurious correlations. Furthermore, we show that certain
classes in the ImageNet dataset contain spurious signals that are easily
detected by the models and discuss the underlying reasons for those spurious
signals. In light of our findings, we provide an exhaustive list of the
aforementioned images and call for caution in their use in future research
efforts. Lastly, we present a case study investigating spurious signals in
invasive breast mass classification, grounding our work in real-world
scenarios.

Abstract: The paper proposes a novel multi-class Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL)
problem called Learning from Majority Label (LML). In LML, the majority class
of instances in a bag is assigned as the bag-level label. The goal of LML is to
train a classification model that estimates the class of each instance using
the majority label. This problem is valuable in a variety of applications,
including pathology image segmentation, political voting prediction, customer
sentiment analysis, and environmental monitoring. To solve LML, we propose a
Counting Network trained to produce bag-level majority labels, estimated by
counting the number of instances in each class. Furthermore, analysis
experiments on the characteristics of LML revealed that bags with a high
proportion of the majority class facilitate learning. Based on this result, we
developed a Majority Proportion Enhancement Module (MPEM) that increases the
proportion of the majority class by removing minority class instances within
the bags. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method on
four datasets compared to conventional MIL methods. Moreover, ablation studies
confirmed the effectiveness of each module. The code is available at

Abstract: In the frontier research and application of current video surveillance
technology, traditional camera systems exhibit significant limitations of
response delay exceeding 200 ms in dynamic scenarios due to the insufficient
deep feature extraction capability of automatic recognition algorithms and the
efficiency bottleneck of computing architectures, failing to meet the real-time

accelerator cards, constructing a UAV tracking and gazing system with
millisecond-level response capability. At the hardware level, the system adopts
a collaborative computing architecture of Phytium FT-2000/4 processors and
MLU220 accelerator cards, enhancing computing power through multi-card
parallelism. At the software level, it innovatively integrates a lightweight
YOLOv5s detection network with a DeepSORT cascaded tracking algorithm, forming
a closed-loop control chain of "detection-tracking-feedback". Experimental
results demonstrate that the system achieves a stable single-frame
comprehensive processing delay of 50-100 ms in 1920*1080 resolution video
stream processing, with a multi-scale target recognition accuracy of over
98.5%, featuring both low latency and high precision. This study provides an
innovative solution for UAV monitoring and the application of domestic chips.

Abstract: In person re-identification, re-ranking is a crucial step to enhance the
overall accuracy by refining the initial ranking of retrieved results. Previous
studies have mainly focused on features from single-view images, which can
cause view bias and issues like pose variation, viewpoint changes, and
occlusions. Using multi-view features to present a person can help reduce view
bias. In this work, we present an efficient re-ranking method that generates
multi-view features by aggregating neighbors' features using K-nearest Weighted
Fusion (KWF) method. Specifically, we hypothesize that features extracted from
re-identification models are highly similar when representing the same
identity. Thus, we select K neighboring features in an unsupervised manner to
generate multi-view features. Additionally, this study explores the weight
selection strategies during feature aggregation, allowing us to identify an
effective strategy. Our re-ranking approach does not require model fine-tuning
or extra annotations, making it applicable to large-scale datasets. We evaluate
our method on the person re-identification datasets Market1501, MSMT17, and
Occluded-DukeMTMC. The results show that our method significantly improves
Rank@1 and mAP when re-ranking the top M candidates from the initial ranking
results. Specifically, compared to the initial results, our re-ranking method
achieves improvements of 9.8%/22.0% in Rank@1 on the challenging datasets:
MSMT17 and Occluded-DukeMTMC, respectively. Furthermore, our approach
demonstrates substantial enhancements in computational efficiency compared to
other re-ranking methods.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Video Parsing (AVVP) task aims to identify event categories and

(ii) generating richer pseudo-labels to compensate for the absence of
frame-level annotations. However, the first type methods treat noisy
segment-level pseudo labels as reliable supervision and the second type methods
let indiscriminate attention spread them across all frames, the initial errors
are repeatedly amplified during training. To address this issue, we propose a
method that combines the Bi-Directional Text Fusion (BiT) module and
Category-Aware Temporal Graph (CATS) module. Specifically, we integrate the
strengths and complementarity of the two previous research directions. We first
perform semantic injection and dynamic calibration on audio and visual modality
features through the BiT module, to locate and purify cleaner and richer
semantic cues. Then, we leverage the CATS module for semantic propagation and
connection to enable precise semantic information dissemination across time.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multiple key indicators on two benchmark
datasets, LLP and UnAV-100.

Abstract: Efficient perception models are essential for Advanced Driver Assistance
Systems (ADAS), as these applications require rapid processing and response to
ensure safety and effectiveness in real-world environments. To address the
real-time execution needs of such perception models, this study introduces the
TriLiteNet model. This model can simultaneously manage multiple tasks related
to panoramic driving perception. TriLiteNet is designed to optimize performance
while maintaining low computational costs. Experimental results on the BDD100k
dataset demonstrate that the model achieves competitive performance across
three key tasks: vehicle detection, drivable area segmentation, and lane line
segmentation. Specifically, the TriLiteNet_{base} demonstrated a recall of
85.6% for vehicle detection, a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 92.4% for
drivable area segmentation, and an Acc of 82.3% for lane line segmentation with
only 2.35M parameters and a computational cost of 7.72 GFLOPs. Our proposed
model includes a tiny configuration with just 0.14M parameters, which provides
a multi-task solution with minimal computational demand. Evaluated for latency
and power consumption on embedded devices, TriLiteNet in both configurations
shows low latency and reasonable power during inference. By balancing
performance, computational efficiency, and scalability, TriLiteNet offers a
practical and deployable solution for real-world autonomous driving
applications. Code is available at https://github.com/chequanghuy/TriLiteNet.

Abstract: Event cameras like Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) report micro-timed brightness
changes instead of full frames, offering low latency, high dynamic range, and
motion robustness. DVS-PedX (Dynamic Vision Sensor Pedestrian eXploration) is a
neuromorphic dataset designed for pedestrian detection and crossing-intention
analysis in normal and adverse weather conditions across two complementary
sources: (1) synthetic event streams generated in the CARLA simulator for
controlled "approach-cross" scenes under varied weather and lighting; and (2)
real-world JAAD dash-cam videos converted to event streams using the v2e tool,
preserving natural behaviors and backgrounds. Each sequence includes paired RGB
frames, per-frame DVS "event frames" (33 ms accumulations), and frame-level
labels (crossing vs. not crossing). We also provide raw AEDAT 2.0/AEDAT 4.0
event files and AVI DVS video files and metadata for flexible re-processing.
Baseline spiking neural networks (SNNs) using SpikingJelly illustrate dataset

TL;DR: TaleDiffusion是一个用于生成多角色故事图像序列的新框架，通过迭代过程保持角色一致性和准确对话分配，解决了现有方法在角色一致性和对话渲染方面的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到故事可视化方法在多个角色跨帧交互时存在角色不一致、伪影生成和对话渲染不准确的问题，导致故事叙述不连贯。

Method: 使用预训练LLM生成每帧描述、角色细节和对话；采用有界注意力掩码技术控制角色交互；应用身份一致自注意力机制确保跨帧角色一致性；使用区域感知交叉注意力进行精确对象放置；通过CLIPSeg渲染对话气泡并分配给角色。

Result: 实验结果表明，TaleDiffusion在一致性、降噪和对话渲染方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TaleDiffusion框架有效解决了多角色故事可视化中的关键挑战，为生成连贯的多角色故事图像序列提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-story visualization is challenging due to the need for consistent
interaction among multiple characters across frames. Existing methods struggle
with character consistency, leading to artifact generation and inaccurate
dialogue rendering, which results in disjointed storytelling. In response, we
introduce TaleDiffusion, a novel framework for generating multi-character
stories with an iterative process, maintaining character consistency, and
accurate dialogue assignment via postprocessing. Given a story, we use a
pre-trained LLM to generate per-frame descriptions, character details, and
dialogues via in-context learning, followed by a bounded attention-based
per-box mask technique to control character interactions and minimize
artifacts. We then apply an identity-consistent self-attention mechanism to
ensure character consistency across frames and region-aware cross-attention for
precise object placement. Dialogues are also rendered as bubbles and assigned
to characters via CLIPSeg. Experimental results demonstrate that TaleDiffusion
outperforms existing methods in consistency, noise reduction, and dialogue
rendering.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型在处理复杂多元素提示时表现不佳，且风格多样性有限，需要更精确的空间控制和专业化的风格处理能力。

Conclusion: 该框架通过专业化专家模块的协同工作，有效解决了复杂多元素提示的生成难题，并提供了良好的可扩展性和实时编辑能力。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable image quality, but
they still struggle with complex, multiele ment prompts, and limited stylistic
diversity. To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-Expert Planning and
Gen eration Framework (MEPG) that synergistically integrates position- and
style-aware large language models (LLMs) with spatial-semantic expert modules.
The framework comprises two core components: (1) a Position-Style-Aware (PSA)
module that utilizes a supervised fine-tuned LLM to decom pose input prompts
into precise spatial coordinates and style encoded semantic instructions; and
(2) a Multi-Expert Dif fusion (MED) module that implements cross-region genera
tion through dynamic expert routing across both local regions and global areas.
During the generation process for each lo cal region, specialized models (e.g.,
realism experts, styliza tion specialists) are selectively activated for each
spatial par tition via attention-based gating mechanisms. The architec ture
supports lightweight integration and replacement of ex pert models, providing
strong extensibility. Additionally, an interactive interface enables real-time
spatial layout editing and per-region style selection from a portfolio of
experts. Ex periments show that MEPG significantly outperforms base line models
with the same backbone in both image quality
  and style diversity.

Conclusion: 简单的调参方法可显著提升深度伪造检测性能，具有实际部署潜力

Abstract: The widespread adoption of synthetic media demands accessible deepfake
detectors and realistic benchmarks. While most existing research evaluates
deepfake detectors on highly controlled datasets, we focus on the recently
released "in-the-wild" benchmark, Deepfake-Eval-2024. Initial reporting on
Deepfake-Eval-2024 showed that three finetuned open-source models achieve
accuracies between 61% and 69%, significantly lagging behind the leading
commercial deepfake detector with 82% accuracy. Our work revisits one of these
baseline approaches, originally introduced by Ojha et al., which adapts
standard pretrained vision backbones to produce generalizable deepfake
detectors. We demonstrate that with better-tuned hyperparameters, this simple
approach actually yields much higher performance -- 81% accuracy on
Deepfake-Eval-2024 -- surpassing the previously reported accuracy of this
baseline approach by 18% and competing with commercial deepfake detectors. We
discuss tradeoffs in accuracy, computational costs, and interpretability,
focusing on how practical these deepfake detectors might be when deployed in
real-world settings. Our code can be found at

Motivation: 传统图像标注工具需要大量人工输入，难以扩展到大规模数据集。为了解决这个问题，需要开发AI辅助的自动化标注工具来提高效率和可扩展性。

Method: VisioFirm采用混合方法，集成CLIP与预训练检测器（如Ultralytics模型）和零样本模型（如Grounding DINO），通过低置信度阈值最大化召回率，并支持交互式标注工具和WebGPU加速的实时分割。

Conclusion: VisioFirm通过AI辅助自动化显著提升了图像标注效率，支持多种标注类型和导出格式，为大规模数据集标注提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: AI models rely on annotated data to learn pattern and perform prediction.
Annotation is usually a labor-intensive step that require associating labels
ranging from a simple classification label to more complex tasks such as object
detection, oriented bounding box estimation, and instance segmentation.
Traditional tools often require extensive manual input, limiting scalability
for large datasets. To address this, we introduce VisioFirm, an open-source web
application designed to streamline image labeling through AI-assisted
automation. VisioFirm integrates state-of-the-art foundation models into an
interface with a filtering pipeline to reduce human-in-the-loop efforts. This
hybrid approach employs CLIP combined with pre-trained detectors like
Ultralytics models for common classes and zero-shot models such as Grounding
DINO for custom labels, generating initial annotations with low-confidence
thresholding to maximize recall. Through this framework, when tested on
COCO-type of classes, initial prediction have been proven to be mostly correct
though the users can refine these via interactive tools supporting bounding
boxes, oriented bounding boxes, and polygons. Additionally, VisioFirm has
on-the-fly segmentation powered by Segment Anything accelerated through WebGPU
for browser-side efficiency. The tool supports multiple export formats (YOLO,
COCO, Pascal VOC, CSV) and operates offline after model caching, enhancing
accessibility. VisioFirm demonstrates up to 90\% reduction in manual effort
through benchmarks on diverse datasets, while maintaining high annotation
accuracy via clustering of connected CLIP-based disambiguate components and
IoU-graph for redundant detection suppression. VisioFirm can be accessed from

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的13个域中实现了最先进的性能

Conclusion: DUDE通过特征解缠和渐进式跨域对齐有效解决了无监督跨域图像检索中的域差距问题，显著提升了检索性能

Abstract: Unsupervised cross-domain image retrieval (UCIR) aims to retrieve images of
the same category across diverse domains without relying on annotations.
Existing UCIR methods, which align cross-domain features for the entire image,
often struggle with the domain gap, as the object features critical for
retrieval are frequently entangled with domain-specific styles. To address this
challenge, we propose DUDE, a novel UCIR method building upon feature
disentanglement. In brief, DUDE leverages a text-to-image generative model to
disentangle object features from domain-specific styles, thus facilitating
semantical image retrieval. To further achieve reliable alignment of the
disentangled object features, DUDE aligns mutual neighbors from within domains
to across domains in a progressive manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that DUDE achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets
over 13 domains. The code will be released.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have recently achieved significant progress in
bridging visual perception and linguistic reasoning. Recently, OpenAI o3 model
introduced a zoom-in search strategy that effectively elicits active perception
capabilities in VLMs, improving downstream task performance. However, enabling
VLMs to reason effectively over appropriate image regions remains a core
challenge in GUI grounding, particularly under high-resolution inputs and
complex multi-element visual interactions. In this work, we propose LASER, a
self-evolving framework that progressively endows VLMs with multi-step
perception capabilities, enabling precise coordinate prediction. Specifically,
our approach integrate Monte Carlo quality estimation with
Intersection-over-Union (IoU)-based region quality evaluation to jointly
encourage both accuracy and diversity in constructing high-quality preference
data. This combination explicitly guides the model to focus on
instruction-relevant key regions while adaptively allocating reasoning steps
based on task complexity. Comprehensive experiments on the ScreenSpot Pro and
ScreenSpot-v2 benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains, validating
the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, when fine-tuned on GTA1-7B, LASER
achieves a score of 55.7 on the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, establishing a new
state-of-the-art (SoTA) among 7B-scale models.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of overhead remote sensing imagery enables applications
in mapping, urban planning, and disaster response. State-of-the-art
segmentation networks are typically developed and tuned on ground-perspective
photographs and do not directly address remote sensing challenges such as
extreme scale variation, foreground-background imbalance, and large image
sizes. We explore the incorporation of the differential morphological profile
(DMP), a multi-scale shape extraction method based on grayscale morphology,
into modern segmentation networks. Prior studies have shown that the DMP can
provide critical shape information to Deep Neural Networks to enable superior
detection and classification performance in overhead imagery. In this work, we
extend prior DMPNet work beyond classification and object detection by
integrating DMP features into three state-of-the-art convolutional and
transformer semantic segmentation architectures. We utilize both direct input,
which adapts the input stem of feature extraction architectures to accept DMP
channels, and hybrid architectures, a dual-stream design that fuses RGB and DMP
encoders. Using the iSAID benchmark dataset, we evaluate a variety of DMP
differentials and structuring element shapes to more effectively provide shape
information to the model. Our results show that while non-DMP models generally
outperform the direct-input variants, hybrid DMP consistently outperforms
direct-input and is capable of surpassing a non-DMP model on mIoU, F1, and
Recall.

Abstract: Accurate quantification of tau pathology via tau positron emission tomography
(PET) scan is crucial for diagnosing and monitoring Alzheimer's disease (AD).
However, the high cost and limited availability of tau PET restrict its
widespread use. In contrast, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
plasma-based biomarkers provide non-invasive and widely available complementary
information related to brain anatomy and disease progression. In this work, we
propose a text-guided 3D diffusion model for 3D tau PET image synthesis,
leveraging multimodal conditions from both structural MRI and plasma
measurement. Specifically, the textual prompt is from the plasma p-tau217
measurement, which is a key indicator of AD progression, while MRI provides
anatomical structure constraints. The proposed framework is trained and
evaluated using clinical AV1451 tau PET data from the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach can generate realistic, clinically meaningful 3D tau PET across a
range of disease stages. The proposed framework can help perform tau PET data
augmentation under different settings, provide a non-invasive, cost-effective
alternative for visualizing tau pathology, and support the simulation of
disease progression under varying plasma biomarker levels and cognitive
conditions.

Abstract: Despite signi cant progress in semi-supervised medical image segmentation,
most existing segmentation networks overlook e ective methodological guidance
for feature extraction and important prior information from
  datasets. In this paper, we develop a semi-supervised medical image
segmentation framework that e ectively integrates spatial regularization
methods and volume priors. Speci cally, our approach integrates a strong
explicit volume prior at the image scale and Threshold Dynamics spatial
regularization, both derived from variational models, into the backbone
segmentation network. The target region volumes for each unlabeled image are
estimated by a regression network, which e ectively regularizes the backbone
segmentation network through an image-scale Wasserstein distance constraint,
ensuring that the class ratios in the segmentation results for each unlabeled
image match those predicted by the regression network. Additionally, we design
a dataset-scale Wasserstein distance loss function based on a weak implicit
volume prior, which enforces that the volume distribution predicted for the
unlabeled dataset is similar to that of labeled dataset. Experimental results
on the 2017 ACDC dataset, PROMISE12 dataset, and thigh muscle MR image dataset
show the superiority of the proposed method.

Conclusion: 该框架能够在稀疏视图和无相机监督的条件下有效学习铰接物体的表示，为实际应用提供了更实用的解决方案

Abstract: We present a novel self-supervised framework for learning articulated object
representations from sparse-view, unposed images. Unlike prior methods that
require dense multi-view observations and ground-truth camera poses, our
approach operates with as few as four views per articulation and no camera
supervision. To address the inherent challenges, we first reconstruct each
articulation independently using recent advances in sparse-view 3D
reconstruction, then learn a deformation field that establishes dense
correspondences across poses. A progressive disentanglement strategy further
separates static from moving parts, enabling robust separation of camera and
object motion. Finally, we jointly optimize geometry, appearance, and
kinematics with a self-supervised loss that enforces cross-view and cross-pose
consistency. Experiments on the standard benchmark and real-world examples
demonstrate that our method produces accurate and detailed articulated object
representations under significantly weaker input assumptions than existing
approaches.

Abstract: Semantic noise in image classification datasets, where visually similar
categories are frequently mislabeled, poses a significant challenge to
conventional supervised learning approaches. In this paper, we explore the
potential of using synthetic images generated by advanced text-to-image models
to address this issue. Although these high-quality synthetic images come with
reliable labels, their direct application in training is limited by domain gaps
and diversity constraints. Unlike conventional approaches, we propose a novel
method that leverages synthetic images as reliable reference points to identify
and correct mislabeled samples in noisy datasets. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmark datasets show that our approach significantly improves
classification accuracy under various noise conditions, especially in
challenging scenarios with semantic label noise. Additionally, since our method
is orthogonal to existing noise-robust learning techniques, when combined with
state-of-the-art noise-robust training methods, it achieves superior
performance, improving accuracy by 30% on CIFAR-10 and by 11% on CIFAR-100

Abstract: The recently introduced odd-one-out anomaly detection task involves
identifying the odd-looking instances within a multi-object scene. This problem
presents several challenges for modern deep learning models, demanding spatial
reasoning across multiple views and relational reasoning to understand context
and generalize across varying object categories and layouts. We argue that
these challenges must be addressed with efficiency in mind. To this end, we
propose a DINO-based model that reduces the number of parameters by one third
and shortens training time by a factor of three compared to the current
state-of-the-art, while maintaining competitive performance. Our experimental
evaluation also introduces a Multimodal Large Language Model baseline,
providing insights into its current limitations in structured visual reasoning
tasks. The project page can be found at

TL;DR: GeoArena是一个评估大型视觉语言模型图像地理定位能力的开放平台，解决了现有评估方法的数据泄露和隐私问题，通过真实野外图像和人类判断进行更准确的评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图像地理定位评估存在两个主要问题：1）数据泄露 - 大型视觉语言模型常在测试数据集上预训练，影响评估准确性；2）现有指标依赖精确坐标，忽视推理过程且存在隐私问题。

Method: 开发GeoArena平台，允许用户上传真实野外图像构建多样化评估语料库，利用成对人类判断来确定模型输出与人类期望的匹配程度。

Result: 平台上线两个月收集了数千条投票记录，基于这些数据进行了详细分析，并建立了不同大型视觉语言模型在图像地理定位任务上的排行榜。

Conclusion: GeoArena提供了一个真实野外和以人为中心的基准测试平台，有效解决了现有评估方法的局限性，为图像地理定位任务提供了更可靠的评估框架。

Abstract: Image geolocalization aims to predict the geographic location of images
captured anywhere on Earth, but its global nature presents significant
challenges. Current evaluation methodologies suffer from two major limitations.
First, data leakage: advanced approaches often rely on large vision-language
models (LVLMs) to predict image locations, yet these models are frequently
pretrained on the test datasets, compromising the accuracy of evaluating a
model's actual geolocalization capability. Second, existing metrics primarily
rely on exact geographic coordinates to assess predictions, which not only
neglects the reasoning process but also raises privacy concerns when user-level
location data is required. To address these issues, we propose GeoArena, a
first open platform for evaluating LVLMs on worldwide image geolocalization
tasks, offering true in-the-wild and human-centered benchmarking. GeoArena
enables users to upload in-the-wild images for a more diverse evaluation
corpus, and it leverages pairwise human judgments to determine which model
output better aligns with human expectations. Our platform has been deployed
online for two months, during which we collected over thousands voting records.
Based on this data, we conduct a detailed analysis and establish a leaderboard
of different LVLMs on the image geolocalization task.

TL;DR: FE2E框架首次将基于Diffusion Transformer的图像编辑模型用于密集几何估计，通过改进损失函数和量化方法，在零样本深度和法线估计任务上取得了显著性能提升，甚至超越了使用100倍训练数据的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 密集预测本质上是图像到图像的任务，因此图像编辑模型可能比文本到图像生成模型更适合作为微调的基础。研究发现编辑模型具有固有的结构先验，能够更稳定地收敛并达到更高性能。

Method: 提出FE2E框架，将先进的基于DiT架构的编辑模型适配到密集几何预测任务。改进编辑器的流匹配损失为"一致速度"训练目标，使用对数量化解决精度冲突，并利用DiT的全局注意力实现深度和法线的联合估计。

Result: 在不增加训练数据的情况下，FE2E在多个数据集的零样本单目深度和法线估计任务上取得了显著性能提升，在ETH3D数据集上性能提升超过35%，超越了使用100倍训练数据的DepthAnything系列方法。

Conclusion: 图像编辑模型比生成模型更适合密集几何估计任务，FE2E框架通过有效利用编辑模型的结构先验和改进训练策略，在零样本几何估计方面取得了突破性进展。

Abstract: Leveraging visual priors from pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) generative
models has shown success in dense prediction. However, dense prediction is
inherently an image-to-image task, suggesting that image editing models, rather
than T2I generative models, may be a more suitable foundation for fine-tuning.
  Motivated by this, we conduct a systematic analysis of the fine-tuning
behaviors of both editors and generators for dense geometry estimation. Our
findings show that editing models possess inherent structural priors, which
enable them to converge more stably by ``refining" their innate features, and
ultimately achieve higher performance than their generative counterparts.
  Based on these findings, we introduce \textbf{FE2E}, a framework that
pioneeringly adapts an advanced editing model based on Diffusion Transformer
(DiT) architecture for dense geometry prediction. Specifically, to tailor the
editor for this deterministic task, we reformulate the editor's original flow
matching loss into the ``consistent velocity" training objective. And we use
logarithmic quantization to resolve the precision conflict between the editor's
native BFloat16 format and the high precision demand of our tasks.
Additionally, we leverage the DiT's global attention for a cost-free joint
estimation of depth and normals in a single forward pass, enabling their
supervisory signals to mutually enhance each other.
  Without scaling up the training data, FE2E achieves impressive performance
improvements in zero-shot monocular depth and normal estimation across multiple
datasets. Notably, it achieves over 35\% performance gains on the ETH3D dataset
and outperforms the DepthAnything series, which is trained on 100$\times$ data.

TL;DR: MICACL是一个新颖的多实例学习框架，通过图增强实例交互模块和加权实例聚合网络解决动态面部表情识别中的长尾分布和时空特征建模问题，并在多个数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态面部表情识别面临长尾类别分布和复杂时空特征建模的挑战，现有深度学习方法存在模型归纳偏差问题，无法有效解决这些限制。

Method: 提出MICACL框架，包含：1）图增强实例交互模块（GEIIM）通过自适应邻接矩阵和多尺度卷积捕获时空依赖关系；2）加权实例聚合网络（WIAN）基于实例重要性动态分配权重；3）多尺度类别感知对比学习策略（MCCL）平衡主次类别训练。

Result: 在DFEW和FERV39k等野外数据集上的大量实验表明，MICACL实现了最先进的性能，具有优异的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: MICACL框架通过整合时空依赖建模和长尾对比学习优化，有效解决了动态面部表情识别中的关键挑战，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) faces significant challenges due
to long-tailed category distributions and complexity of spatio-temporal feature
modeling. While existing deep learning-based methods have improved DFER
performance, they often fail to address these issues, resulting in severe model
induction bias. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
multi-instance learning framework called MICACL, which integrates
spatio-temporal dependency modeling and long-tailed contrastive learning
optimization. Specifically, we design the Graph-Enhanced Instance Interaction
Module (GEIIM) to capture intricate spatio-temporal between adjacent instances
relationships through adaptive adjacency matrices and multiscale convolutions.
To enhance instance-level feature aggregation, we develop the Weighted Instance
Aggregation Network (WIAN), which dynamically assigns weights based on instance
importance. Furthermore, we introduce a Multiscale Category-aware Contrastive
Learning (MCCL) strategy to balance training between major and minor
categories. Extensive experiments on in-the-wild datasets (i.e., DFEW and
FERV39k) demonstrate that MICACL achieves state-of-the-art performance with
superior robustness and generalization.

Abstract: First responders widely adopt body-worn cameras to document incident scenes
and support post-event analysis. However, reviewing lengthy video footage is
impractical in time-critical situations. Effective situational awareness
demands a concise visual summary that can be quickly interpreted. This work
presents a computer vision pipeline that transforms body-camera footage into
informative panoramic images summarizing the incident scene. Our method
leverages monocular Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to estimate
camera trajectories and reconstruct the spatial layout of the environment. Key
viewpoints are identified by clustering camera poses along the trajectory, and
representative frames from each cluster are selected. These frames are fused
into spatially coherent panoramic images using multi-frame stitching
techniques. The resulting summaries enable rapid understanding of complex
environments and facilitate efficient decision-making and incident review.

Motivation: 解决文本人员异常搜索中的两个关键挑战：文本异常与视觉行为的细粒度跨模态对齐，以及在稀疏真实样本下的异常识别。探索大型多模态模型在此任务中的潜力。

Method: 提出coarse-to-fine流程，整合大型多模态模型；采用无训练适应方法，包括掩码跨模态提示、行为显著性预测和知识感知重排序，实现零样本关注细微异常线索。

Conclusion: AnomalyLMM是首个利用大型多模态模型进行文本人员异常搜索的框架，通过创新的无训练适应策略有效解决了领域差距问题，为未来研究提供了有价值的基准。

Abstract: With growing public safety demands, text-based person anomaly search has
emerged as a critical task, aiming to retrieve individuals with abnormal
behaviors via natural language descriptions. Unlike conventional person search,
this task presents two unique challenges: (1) fine-grained cross-modal
alignment between textual anomalies and visual behaviors, and (2) anomaly
recognition under sparse real-world samples. While Large Multi-modal Models
(LMMs) excel in multi-modal understanding, their potential for fine-grained
anomaly retrieval remains underexplored, hindered by: (1) a domain gap between
generative knowledge and discriminative retrieval, and (2) the absence of
efficient adaptation strategies for deployment. In this work, we propose
AnomalyLMM, the first framework that harnesses LMMs for text-based person
anomaly search. Our key contributions are: (1) A novel coarse-to-fine pipeline
integrating LMMs to bridge generative world knowledge with retrieval-centric
anomaly detection; (2) A training-free adaptation cookbook featuring masked
cross-modal prompting, behavioral saliency prediction, and knowledge-aware
re-ranking, enabling zero-shot focus on subtle anomaly cues. As the first study
to explore LMMs for this task, we conduct a rigorous evaluation on the PAB
dataset, the only publicly available benchmark for text-based person anomaly
search, with its curated real-world anomalies covering diverse scenarios (e.g.,
falling, collision, and being hit). Experiments show the effectiveness of the
proposed method, surpassing the competitive baseline by +0.96% Recall@1
accuracy. Notably, our method reveals interpretable alignment between textual
anomalies and visual behaviors, validated via qualitative analysis. Our code
and models will be released for future research.

Motivation: 现有美学图像描述研究主要依赖微调方法，没有专门让多模态大语言模型关注目标美学内容，需要开发能够显式整合美学显著性的框架。

Method: 提出端到端的ASE-MLLM框架，包含图像美学显著性模块(IASM)高效提取美学显著性特征，设计IAS-ViT图像编码器通过交叉注意力机制融合美学显著性特征和原始图像特征。

Result: 在主流美学图像描述基准测试中显著优于传统方法和通用多模态大语言模型，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ASE-MLLM是首个专门为美学图像描述任务整合图像美学显著性的多模态大语言模型框架，通过显式融入美学显著性特征有效提升了描述生成质量。

Abstract: Aesthetic Image Captioning (AIC) aims to generate textual descriptions of
image aesthetics, becoming a key research direction in the field of
computational aesthetics. In recent years, pretrained Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly, leading to a significant increase in
image aesthetics research that integrates both visual and textual modalities.
However, most existing studies on image aesthetics primarily focus on
predicting aesthetic ratings and have shown limited application in AIC.
Existing AIC works leveraging MLLMs predominantly rely on fine-tuning methods
without specifically adapting MLLMs to focus on target aesthetic content. To
address this limitation, we propose the Aesthetic Saliency Enhanced Multimodal
Large Language Model (ASE-MLLM), an end-to-end framework that explicitly
incorporates aesthetic saliency into MLLMs. Within this framework, we introduce
the Image Aesthetic Saliency Module (IASM), which efficiently and effectively
extracts aesthetic saliency features from images. Additionally, we design
IAS-ViT as the image encoder for MLLMs, this module fuses aesthetic saliency
features with original image features via a cross-attention mechanism. To the
best of our knowledge, ASE-MLLM is the first framework to integrate image
aesthetic saliency into MLLMs specifically for AIC tasks. Extensive experiments
demonstrated that our approach significantly outperformed traditional methods
and generic MLLMs on current mainstream AIC benchmarks, achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Conclusion: 该研究提出的3D风格迁移流水线能够生成更结构化、视觉一致且艺术性丰富的风格化结果，有效解决了现有方法在高级风格语义提取和实例分离方面的问题

Abstract: Recent advancements in neural representations, such as Neural Radiance Fields
and 3D Gaussian Splatting, have increased interest in applying style transfer
to 3D scenes. While existing methods can transfer style patterns onto
3D-consistent neural representations, they struggle to effectively extract and
transfer high-level style semantics from the reference style image.
Additionally, the stylized results often lack structural clarity and
separation, making it difficult to distinguish between different instances or
objects within the 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
3D style transfer pipeline that effectively integrates prior knowledge from
pretrained 2D diffusion models. Our pipeline consists of two key stages: First,
we leverage diffusion priors to generate stylized renderings of key viewpoints.
Then, we transfer the stylized key views onto the 3D representation. This
process incorporates two innovative designs. The first is cross-view style
alignment, which inserts cross-view attention into the last upsampling block of
the UNet, allowing feature interactions across multiple key views. This ensures
that the diffusion model generates stylized key views that maintain both style
fidelity and instance-level consistency. The second is instance-level style
transfer, which effectively leverages instance-level consistency across
stylized key views and transfers it onto the 3D representation. This results in
a more structured, visually coherent, and artistically enriched stylization.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our 3D
style transfer pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across a wide range of scenes, from forward-facing to challenging 360-degree
environments. Visit our project page https://jm-xu.github.io/SSGaussian for

Result: 在模拟和实验数据上均实现了优异的重建质量，在挑战性低信号条件下表现出卓越的鲁棒性

Conclusion: PtyINR提供了一个通用、物理信息化的框架，适用于解决探针依赖的逆问题，可广泛应用于计算显微镜领域

Abstract: X-ray ptychography provides exceptional nanoscale resolution and is widely
applied in materials science, biology, and nanotechnology. However, its full
potential is constrained by the critical challenge of accurately reconstructing
images when the illuminating probe is unknown. Conventional iterative methods
and deep learning approaches are often suboptimal, particularly under the
low-signal conditions inherent to low-dose and high-speed experiments. These
limitations compromise reconstruction fidelity and restrict the broader
adoption of the technique. In this work, we introduce the Ptychographic
Implicit Neural Representation (PtyINR), a self-supervised framework that
simultaneously addresses the object and probe recovery problem. By
parameterizing both as continuous neural representations, PtyINR performs
end-to-end reconstruction directly from raw diffraction patterns without
requiring any pre-characterization of the probe. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that PtyINR achieves superior reconstruction quality on both
simulated and experimental data, with remarkable robustness under challenging
low-signal conditions. Furthermore, PtyINR offers a generalizable,
physics-informed framework for addressing probe-dependent inverse problems,
making it applicable to a wide range of computational microscopy problems.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly evolving, presenting
increasingly complex safety challenges. However, current dataset construction
methods, which are risk-oriented, fail to cover the growing complexity of
real-world multimodal safety scenarios (RMS). And due to the lack of a unified
evaluation metric, their overall effectiveness remains unproven. This paper
introduces a novel image-oriented self-adaptive dataset construction method for
RMS, which starts with images and end constructing paired text and guidance
responses. Using the image-oriented method, we automatically generate an RMS
dataset comprising 35k image-text pairs with guidance responses. Additionally,
we introduce a standardized safety dataset evaluation metric: fine-tuning a
safety judge model and evaluating its capabilities on other safety
datasets.Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed image-oriented pipeline. The results confirm the scalability
and effectiveness of the image-oriented approach, offering a new perspective
for the construction of real-world multimodal safety datasets.

Motivation: 现有的流式3D生成模型需要数十步采样，一致性模型在2D领域加速效果显著但在3D生成任务中研究不足，需要开发高效的少步数3D流蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: 该方法显著优于现有的一致性模型蒸馏方法，使TRELLIS在少步数3D生成中达到优异性能，为高效3D生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Flow-based 3D generation models typically require dozens of sampling steps
during inference. Though few-step distillation methods, particularly
Consistency Models (CMs), have achieved substantial advancements in
accelerating 2D diffusion models, they remain under-explored for more complex
3D generation tasks. In this study, we propose a novel framework, MDT-dist, for
few-step 3D flow distillation. Our approach is built upon a primary objective:
distilling the pretrained model to learn the Marginal-Data Transport. Directly
learning this objective needs to integrate the velocity fields, while this
integral is intractable to be implemented. Therefore, we propose two
optimizable objectives, Velocity Matching (VM) and Velocity Distillation (VD),
to equivalently convert the optimization target from the transport level to the
velocity and the distribution level respectively. Velocity Matching (VM) learns
to stably match the velocity fields between the student and the teacher, but
inevitably provides biased gradient estimates. Velocity Distillation (VD)
further enhances the optimization process by leveraging the learned velocity
fields to perform probability density distillation. When evaluated on the
pioneer 3D generation framework TRELLIS, our method reduces sampling steps of
each flow transformer from 25 to 1 or 2, achieving 0.68s (1 step x 2) and 0.94s
(2 steps x 2) latency with 9.0x and 6.5x speedup on A800, while preserving high
visual and geometric fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing CM distillation methods, and enables
TRELLIS to achieve superior performance in few-step 3D generation.

Conclusion: Durian通过创新的双参考网络设计和训练策略，成功实现了零样本高保真肖像动画生成，为多属性组合迁移提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: We present Durian, the first method for generating portrait animation videos
with facial attribute transfer from a given reference image to a target
portrait in a zero-shot manner. To enable high-fidelity and spatially
consistent attribute transfer across frames, we introduce dual reference
networks that inject spatial features from both the portrait and attribute
images into the denoising process of a diffusion model. We train the model
using a self-reconstruction formulation, where two frames are sampled from the
same portrait video: one is treated as the attribute reference and the other as
the target portrait, and the remaining frames are reconstructed conditioned on
these inputs and their corresponding masks. To support the transfer of
attributes with varying spatial extent, we propose a mask expansion strategy
using keypoint-conditioned image generation for training. In addition, we
further augment the attribute and portrait images with spatial and
appearance-level transformations to improve robustness to positional
misalignment between them. These strategies allow the model to effectively
generalize across diverse attributes and in-the-wild reference combinations,
despite being trained without explicit triplet supervision. Durian achieves
state-of-the-art performance on portrait animation with attribute transfer, and
notably, its dual reference design enables multi-attribute composition in a
single generation pass without additional training.

Abstract: Collimation in X-ray imaging restricts exposure to the region-of-interest
(ROI) and minimizes the radiation dose applied to the patient. The detection of
collimator shadows is an essential image-based preprocessing step in digital
radiography posing a challenge when edges get obscured by scattered X-ray
radiation. Regardless, the prior knowledge that collimation forms
polygonal-shaped shadows is evident. For this reason, we introduce a deep
learning-based segmentation that is inherently constrained to its geometry. We
achieve this by incorporating a differentiable Hough transform-based network to
detect the collimation borders and enhance its capability to extract the
information about the ROI center. During inference, we combine the information
of both tasks to enable the generation of refined, line-constrained
segmentation masks. We demonstrate robust reconstruction of collimated regions
achieving median Hausdorff distances of 4.3-5.0mm on diverse test sets of real
Xray images. While this application involves at most four shadow borders, our
method is not fundamentally limited by a specific number of edges.

Motivation: 现有评估方法单独考察文本到图像(T2I)和图像到文本(I2T)能力，但无法衡量模型在跨模态循环转换中是否保持语义一致性，需要新的评估框架来量化语义漂移。

Conclusion: 循环一致性评估是标准I2T和T2I评估的必要补充，UCF-UM提供了实用的指标来一致评估统一模型的跨模态稳定性和共享表示强度。

Abstract: Employing a single, unified model (UM) for both visual understanding
(image-to-text: I2T) and and visual generation (text-to-image: T2I) has opened
a new direction in Visual Language Model (VLM) research. While UMs can also
support broader unimodal tasks (e.g., text-to-text, image-to-image), we focus
on the core cross-modal pair T2I and I2T, as consistency between understanding
and generation is critical for downstream use. Existing evaluations consider
these capabilities in isolation: FID and GenEval for T2I, and benchmarks such
as MME, MMBench for I2T. These single-pass metrics do not reveal whether a
model that understands a concept can also render it, nor whether meaning is
preserved when cycling between image and text modalities. To address this, we
introduce the Unified Consistency Framework for Unified Models (UCF-UM), a
cyclic evaluation protocol that alternates I2T and T2I over multiple
generations to quantify semantic drift. UCF formulates 3 metrics: (i) Mean
Cumulative Drift (MCD), an embedding-based measure of overall semantic loss;
(ii) Semantic Drift Rate (SDR), that summarizes semantic decay rate; and (iii)
Multi-Generation GenEval (MGG), an object-level compliance score extending
GenEval. To assess generalization beyond COCO, which is widely used in
training; we create a new benchmark ND400, sampled from NoCaps and DOCCI and
evaluate on seven recent models. UCF-UM reveals substantial variation in
cross-modal stability: some models like BAGEL maintain semantics over many
alternations, whereas others like Vila-u drift quickly despite strong
single-pass scores. Our results highlight cyclic consistency as a necessary
complement to standard I2T and T2I evaluations, and provide practical metrics
to consistently assess unified model's cross-modal stability and strength of
their shared representations. Code:

TL;DR: 这篇论文是一个全景视觉技术的综述性调研，重点分析了透视图像向全景图像的域适配挑战，包括几何扭曲、非均匀采样和周期边界续性问题，并系统总结了4个主要分类的20+代表性任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着虚拟现实、自动驾驶和机器人等应用对空间智能和全景感知的需求增长，全景图像(ODIs)逐渐受到关注，但其与透视图像在几何投影、空间分布和边界续性上存在显著差异，导致直接域适配面临挑战。

Method: 首先重新审视全景成像流程和投影方法，建立分析结构差异所需的先验知识。提出域适配的三大挑战：极点附近的严重几何扭曲、等矩投影(ERP)中的非均匀采样、以及周期边界续性。在这基础上，从两个维度对300+论文中挖掘出20+代表性任务进行分析。

Result: 系统总结了全景视觉技术的四个主要分类：视觉质量提升与评估、视觉理解、多模态理解以及视觉生成。通过跨方法分析展示了不同任务中解决全景特定挑战的代表性策略，并通过跨任务比较对全景视觉进行了分类。

Conclusion: 论文讨论了数据、模型和应用方面的开放性挑战和未来方向，以推动全景视觉研究的发展。该综述为全景视觉技术的发展提供了新的见解和前瞻性观点，希望能够推动该领域的进步。

Abstract: Driven by the demand for spatial intelligence and holistic scene perception,
omnidirectional images (ODIs), which provide a complete 360\textdegree{} field
of view, are receiving growing attention across diverse applications such as
virtual reality, autonomous driving, and embodied robotics. Despite their
unique characteristics, ODIs exhibit remarkable differences from perspective
images in geometric projection, spatial distribution, and boundary continuity,
making it challenging for direct domain adaption from perspective methods. This
survey reviews recent panoramic vision techniques with a particular emphasis on
the perspective-to-panorama adaptation. We first revisit the panoramic imaging
pipeline and projection methods to build the prior knowledge required for
analyzing the structural disparities. Then, we summarize three challenges of
domain adaptation: severe geometric distortions near the poles, non-uniform
sampling in Equirectangular Projection (ERP), and periodic boundary continuity.
Building on this, we cover 20+ representative tasks drawn from more than 300
research papers in two dimensions. On one hand, we present a cross-method
analysis of representative strategies for addressing panoramic specific
challenges across different tasks. On the other hand, we conduct a cross-task
comparison and classify panoramic vision into four major categories: visual
quality enhancement and assessment, visual understanding, multimodal
understanding, and visual generation. In addition, we discuss open challenges
and future directions in data, models, and applications that will drive the
advancement of panoramic vision research. We hope that our work can provide new
insight and forward looking perspectives to advance the development of
panoramic vision technologies. Our project page is

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated significant capabilities to
generate diverse and detailed visuals in various domains, and story
visualization is emerging as a particularly promising application. However, as
their use in real-world creative domains increases, the need for providing
enhanced control, refinement, and the ability to modify images post-generation
in a consistent manner becomes an important challenge. Existing methods often
lack the flexibility to apply fine or coarse edits while maintaining visual and
narrative consistency across multiple frames, preventing creators from
seamlessly crafting and refining their visual stories. To address these
challenges, we introduce Plot'n Polish, a zero-shot framework that enables
consistent story generation and provides fine-grained control over story
visualizations at various levels of detail.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态虚假信息（包含文本、视觉和跨模态失真）对社会威胁日益严重，现有方法通常只关注单一失真类型且难以泛化到未见场景。不同失真类型共享推理能力但需要任务特定技能。

Method: 提出TRUST-VL模型，包含新颖的问题感知视觉放大器模块来提取任务特定视觉特征。构建TRUST-Instruct大规模指令数据集（198K样本），包含与人工事实核查工作流程对齐的结构化推理链。

Conclusion: 联合训练跨失真类型促进了知识共享，增强了模型的泛化能力，TRUST-VL为多模态虚假信息检测提供了一个有效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal misinformation, encompassing textual, visual, and cross-modal
distortions, poses an increasing societal threat that is amplified by
generative AI. Existing methods typically focus on a single type of distortion
and struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios. In this work, we observe that
different distortion types share common reasoning capabilities while also
requiring task-specific skills. We hypothesize that joint training across
distortion types facilitates knowledge sharing and enhances the model's ability
to generalize. To this end, we introduce TRUST-VL, a unified and explainable
vision-language model for general multimodal misinformation detection. TRUST-VL
incorporates a novel Question-Aware Visual Amplifier module, designed to
extract task-specific visual features. To support training, we also construct
TRUST-Instruct, a large-scale instruction dataset containing 198K samples
featuring structured reasoning chains aligned with human fact-checking
workflows. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and zero-shot benchmarks
demonstrate that TRUST-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance, while also
offering strong generalization and interpretability.

Motivation: 解决长视频虚拟试穿生成的技术挑战，包括需要大量计算资源和长视频数据，以及保证视频的局部滑顺性和全局一致性。

Method: 采用分段自回归生成方法，通过前缀视频条件保证相邻段落间的局部滑顺性，并使用锚点视频(360度全身视频)来维护不同段落间的全局时间一致性。

Result: VFR能够生成分钟级别的虚拟试穿视频，在各种动作下都能保持良好的局部滑顺性和全局时间一致性，成为长视频虚拟试穿生成领域的先驱性工作。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种高效的长视频虚拟试穿生成方案，通过分段生成策略和两种条件控制机制，成功解决了长视频生成的关键技术挑战，为该领域的发展提供了新的思路。

Abstract: We introduce the Virtual Fitting Room (VFR), a novel video generative model
that produces arbitrarily long virtual try-on videos. Our VFR models long video
generation tasks as an auto-regressive, segment-by-segment generation process,
eliminating the need for resource-intensive generation and lengthy video data,
while providing the flexibility to generate videos of arbitrary length. The key
challenges of this task are twofold: ensuring local smoothness between adjacent
segments and maintaining global temporal consistency across different segments.
To address these challenges, we propose our VFR framework, which ensures
smoothness through a prefix video condition and enforces consistency with the
anchor video -- a 360-degree video that comprehensively captures the human's
wholebody appearance. Our VFR generates minute-scale virtual try-on videos with
both local smoothness and global temporal consistency under various motions,
making it a pioneering work in long virtual try-on video generation.

Motivation: 现有语音超分辨率系统存在表示不匹配、高频内容过度平滑、计算成本高以及跨域和采样率鲁棒性有限等问题。

Method: 提出基于Swin Transformer的U-Net架构，使用混合对抗方案（时域MPD/MSD判别器+多频带MDCT判别器），在arcsinh压缩的MDCT上应用稀疏感知正则化。

Result: 在标准基准测试中降低了客观误差并提高了ABX偏好分数，在HiFi-TTS零样本测试中优于NVSR和mdctGAN，表现出强大的跨数据集泛化能力。

Conclusion: SwinSRGAN能够以单次前向传递将不同采样率的输入上采样到48kHz，实现实时处理，并在多个测试场景中展现出优异的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Speech super-resolution (SR) reconstructs high-frequency content from
low-resolution speech signals. Existing systems often suffer from
representation mismatch in two-stage mel-vocoder pipelines and from
over-smoothing of hallucinated high-band content by CNN-only generators.
Diffusion and flow models are computationally expensive, and their robustness
across domains and sampling rates remains limited. We propose SwinSRGAN, an
end-to-end framework operating on Modified Discrete Cosine Transform (MDCT)
magnitudes. It is a Swin Transformer-based U-Net that captures long-range
spectro-temporal dependencies with a hybrid adversarial scheme combines
time-domain MPD/MSD discriminators with a multi-band MDCT discriminator
specialized for the high-frequency band. We employs a sparse-aware regularizer
on arcsinh-compressed MDCT to better preserve transient components. The system
upsamples inputs at various sampling rates to 48 kHz in a single pass and
operates in real time. On standard benchmarks, SwinSRGAN reduces objective
error and improves ABX preference scores. In zero-shot tests on HiFi-TTS
without fine-tuning, it outperforms NVSR and mdctGAN, demonstrating strong
generalization across datasets

Abstract: The development of speech understanding and generation has been significantly
accelerated by the availability of large-scale, high-quality speech datasets.
Among these, ASR and TTS are regarded as the most established and fundamental
tasks. However, for Cantonese (Yue Chinese), spoken by approximately 84.9
million native speakers worldwide, limited annotated resources have hindered
progress and resulted in suboptimal ASR and TTS performance. To address this
challenge, we propose WenetSpeech-Pipe, an integrated pipeline for building
large-scale speech corpus with multi-dimensional annotation tailored for speech
understanding and generation. It comprises six modules: Audio Collection,
Speaker Attributes Annotation, Speech Quality Annotation, Automatic Speech
Recognition, Text Postprocessing and Recognizer Output Voting, enabling rich
and high-quality annotations. Based on this pipeline, we release
WenetSpeech-Yue, the first large-scale Cantonese speech corpus with
multi-dimensional annotation for ASR and TTS, covering 21,800 hours across 10
domains with annotations including ASR transcription, text confidence, speaker
identity, age, gender, speech quality scores, among other annotations. We also
release WSYue-eval, a comprehensive Cantonese benchmark with two components:
WSYue-ASR-eval, a manually annotated set for evaluating ASR on short and long
utterances, code-switching, and diverse acoustic conditions, and
WSYue-TTS-eval, with base and coverage subsets for standard and generalization
testing. Experimental results show that models trained on WenetSpeech-Yue
achieve competitive results against state-of-the-art (SOTA) Cantonese ASR and
TTS systems, including commercial and LLM-based models, highlighting the value

Abstract: Full-duplex, spontaneous conversational data are essential for enhancing the
naturalness and interactivity of synthesized speech in conversational TTS
systems. We present two open-source dual-track conversational speech datasets,
one in Chinese and one in English, designed to enhance the naturalness of
synthesized speech by providing more realistic conversational data. The two
datasets contain a total of 15 hours of natural, spontaneous conversations
recorded in isolated rooms, which produces separate high-quality audio tracks
for each speaker. The conversations cover diverse daily topics and domains,
capturing realistic interaction patterns including frequent overlaps,
backchannel responses, laughter, and other non-verbal vocalizations. We
introduce the data collection procedure, transcription and annotation methods.
We demonstrate the utility of these corpora by fine-tuning a baseline TTS model
with the proposed datasets. The fine-tuned TTS model achieves higher subjective
and objective evaluation metrics compared to the baseline, indicating improved
naturalness and conversational realism in synthetic speech. All data,
annotations, and supporting code for fine-tuning and evaluation are made
available to facilitate further research in conversational speech synthesis.

Abstract: With the continuous development of speech recognition technology, speaker
verification (SV) has become an important method for identity authentication.
Traditional SV methods rely on handcrafted feature extraction, while deep
learning has significantly improved system performance. However, the scarcity
of labeled data still limits the widespread application of deep learning in SV.
Self-supervised learning, by mining latent information in large unlabeled
datasets, enhances model generalization and is a key technology to address this
issue.
  DINO is an efficient self-supervised learning method that generates
pseudo-labels from unlabeled speech data through clustering, supporting
subsequent training. However, clustering may produce noisy pseudo-labels, which
can reduce overall recognition performance.
  To address this issue, this paper proposes an improved clustering framework
based on similarity connection graphs and Graph Convolutional Networks. By
leveraging GCNs' ability to model structured data and incorporating relational
information between nodes in the similarity connection graph, the clustering
process is optimized, improving pseudo-label accuracy and enhancing the
robustness and performance of the self-supervised speaker verification system.
Experimental results show that this method significantly improves system
performance and provides a new approach for self-supervised speaker
verification.

Abstract: In recent years, self-supervised learning (SSL) models have made significant
progress in audio deepfake detection (ADD) tasks. However, existing SSL models
mainly rely on large-scale real speech for pre-training and lack the learning
of spoofed samples, which leads to susceptibility to domain bias during the
fine-tuning process of the ADD task. To this end, we propose a two-stage
learning strategy (Wav2DF-TSL) based on pre-training and hierarchical expert
fusion for robust audio deepfake detection. In the pre-training stage, we use
adapters to efficiently learn artifacts from 3000 hours of unlabelled spoofed
speech, improving the adaptability of front-end features while mitigating
catastrophic forgetting. In the fine-tuning stage, we propose the hierarchical
adaptive mixture of experts (HA-MoE) method to dynamically fuse multi-level
spoofing cues through multi-expert collaboration with gated routing.
Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms
the baseline system on all four benchmark datasets, especially on the
cross-domain In-the-wild dataset, achieving a 27.5% relative improvement in
equal error rate (EER), outperforming the existing state-of-the-art systems.

Abstract: Solo piano music, despite being a single-instrument medium, possesses
significant expressive capabilities, conveying rich semantic information across
genres, moods, and styles. However, current general-purpose music
representation models, predominantly trained on large-scale datasets, often
struggle to captures subtle semantic distinctions within homogeneous solo piano
music. Furthermore, existing piano-specific representation models are typically
unimodal, failing to capture the inherently multimodal nature of piano music,
expressed through audio, symbolic, and textual modalities. To address these
limitations, we propose PianoBind, a piano-specific multimodal joint embedding
model. We systematically investigate strategies for multi-source training and
modality utilization within a joint embedding framework optimized for capturing
fine-grained semantic distinctions in (1) small-scale and (2) homogeneous piano
datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate that PianoBind learns multimodal
representations that effectively capture subtle nuances of piano music,
achieving superior text-to-music retrieval performance on in-domain and
out-of-domain piano datasets compared to general-purpose music joint embedding
models. Moreover, our design choices offer reusable insights for multimodal
representation learning with homogeneous datasets beyond piano music.

Motivation: 当前语音生成系统能够产生难以区分真伪的语音，但现有的深度伪造检测方法在真实环境中效果不佳，主要原因是训练和测试样本之间的域偏移问题，现有数据集缺乏真实世界应用的挑战性。

Method: 构建AUDETER数据集，包含大量由多种TTS模型和声码器生成的合成音频，用于全面评估和开发通用的深度伪造音频检测模型。

Result: 实验表明：1）现有SOTA方法在新样本上泛化能力差，对未见人声误报率高；2）使用AUDETER训练的方法显著降低检测错误率44.1%-51.6%，在In-the-Wild数据集上错误率仅4.17%。

Conclusion: AUDETER数据集为训练通用深度伪造音频检测器铺平了道路，解决了现有数据集在真实世界应用中的局限性问题。

Abstract: Speech generation systems can produce remarkably realistic vocalisations that
are often indistinguishable from human speech, posing significant authenticity
challenges. Although numerous deepfake detection methods have been developed,
their effectiveness in real-world environments remains unrealiable due to the
domain shift between training and test samples arising from diverse human
speech and fast evolving speech synthesis systems. This is not adequately
addressed by current datasets, which lack real-world application challenges
with diverse and up-to-date audios in both real and deep-fake categories. To
fill this gap, we introduce AUDETER (AUdio DEepfake TEst Range), a large-scale,
highly diverse deepfake audio dataset for comprehensive evaluation and robust
development of generalised models for deepfake audio detection. It consists of
over 4,500 hours of synthetic audio generated by 11 recent TTS models and 10
vocoders with a broad range of TTS/vocoder patterns, totalling 3 million audio
clips, making it the largest deepfake audio dataset by scale. Through extensive
experiments with AUDETER, we reveal that i) state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods
trained on existing datasets struggle to generalise to novel deepfake audio
samples and suffer from high false positive rates on unseen human voice,
underscoring the need for a comprehensive dataset; and ii) these methods
trained on AUDETER achieve highly generalised detection performance and
significantly reduce detection error rate by 44.1% to 51.6%, achieving an error
rate of only 4.17% on diverse cross-domain samples in the popular In-the-Wild
dataset, paving the way for training generalist deepfake audio detectors.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLM) have made significant progress
in the task of generation error correction (GER) for automatic speech
recognition (ASR) post-processing. However, in complex noisy environments, they
still face challenges such as poor adaptability and low information
utilization, resulting in limited effectiveness of GER. To address these
issues, this paper proposes a noise-robust multi-modal GER framework (Denoising
GER). The framework enhances the model's adaptability to different noisy
scenarios through a noise-adaptive acoustic encoder and optimizes the
integration of multi-modal information via a heterogeneous feature compensation
dynamic fusion (HFCDF) mechanism, improving the LLM's utilization of
multi-modal information. Additionally, reinforcement learning (RL) training
strategies are introduced to enhance the model's predictive capabilities.
Experimental results demonstrate that Denoising GER significantly improves
accuracy and robustness in noisy environments and exhibits good generalization
abilities in unseen noise scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CTD的语音查询拼写纠正方法，使用BERT生成上下文表征并通过比较原始和上下文表征来纠正错误标记


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语音搜索的普及，自动语音识别系统产生的错误转录需要有效的纠正方法来帮助用户清晰表达意图

Method: 使用BERT生成token级上下文表征，构建组合层增强语义信息，通过比较原始和上下文表征来纠正错误标记

Result: 在所有指标上都表现出优越性能，并提供了一个包含错误ASR转录的新基准数据集

Conclusion: CTD方法在语音查询纠正方面效果显著，为音频查询纠正提供了全面的评估基准

Abstract: Query spelling correction is an important function of modern search engines
since it effectively helps users express their intentions clearly. With the
growing popularity of speech search driven by Automated Speech Recognition
(ASR) systems, this paper introduces a novel method named Contextualized Token
Discrimination (CTD) to conduct effective speech query correction. In CTD, we
first employ BERT to generate token-level contextualized representations and
then construct a composition layer to enhance semantic information. Finally, we
produce the correct query according to the aggregated token representation,
correcting the incorrect tokens by comparing the original token representations
and the contextualized representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superior performance of our proposed method across all metrics, and we further
present a new benchmark dataset with erroneous ASR transcriptions to offer
comprehensive evaluations for audio query correction.

*Thomas R. Harvey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于黎曼几何的新型神经网络优化器，利用损失景观在高维空间中的自然度量，在低维任务中表现优异，在神经网络训练中略优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从几何视角出发，利用损失景观可视化中自然诱导的黎曼度量来开发更有效的优化算法

Method: 基于黎曼几何的优化器设计，使用高维空间嵌入损失景观时自然诱导的度量，可修改任何现有预处理方法

Result: 在低维示例中高度有效，在神经网络训练中相比SGD、Adam、AdamW、Muon等state-of-the-art方法有轻微改进

Conclusion: 新型优化器具有理论优势：在高曲率区域自动降低有效学习率（平滑梯度裁剪），变体可诱导有效学习率调度，解耦权重衰减是几何视角的自然选择，计算复杂度与Adam相当

Abstract: We present a class of novel optimisers for training neural networks that
makes use of the Riemannian metric naturally induced when the loss landscape is
embedded in higher-dimensional space. This is the same metric that underlies
common visualisations of loss landscapes. By taking this geometric perspective
literally and using the induced metric, we develop a new optimiser and compare
it to existing methods, namely: SGD, Adam, AdamW, and Muon, across a range of
tasks and architectures. Empirically, we conclude that this new class of
optimisers is highly effective in low dimensional examples, and provides slight
improvement over state-of-the-art methods for training neural networks. These
new optimisers have theoretically desirable properties. In particular, the
effective learning rate is automatically decreased in regions of high curvature
acting as a smoothed out form of gradient clipping. Similarly, one variant of
these optimisers can also be viewed as inducing an effective scheduled learning
rate and decoupled weight decay is the natural choice from our geometric
perspective. The basic method can be used to modify any existing
preconditioning method. The new optimiser has a computational complexity
comparable to that of Adam.

*Lucas Lopes Felipe,Konstantin Avrachenkov,Daniel Sadoc Menasche*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文从游戏论角度分析Constant Potts模型(CPM)，通过将全局哄孜顿量分解为局部效用函数，证明了局部优化的伪多项式时间收敛性，并提出了更稳健的社区分割标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统社区发现算法在效率、稳健性和准确性方面遇到挑战，需要从游戏论角度提供更有效的解决方案。

Method: 将CPM全局哄孜顿量分解为局部效用函数，构建潜在式游戏模型，并提出两种稳定性标准：严格的稳健性和放松的权重效用函数。

Result: 理论证明局部优化在伪多项式时间内收敛到均衡分割，实验结果显示稳健分割在社区追踪任务中能更准确地恢复真实社区结构。

Conclusion: 游戏论角度为CPM模型提供了理论基础，新的稳健性标准能够在保持高效率的同时提升社区发现的准确性和稳健性。

Abstract: Community detection is one of the fundamental problems in data science which
consists of partitioning nodes into disjoint communities. We present a
game-theoretic perspective on the Constant Potts Model (CPM) for partitioning
networks into disjoint communities, emphasizing its efficiency, robustness, and
accuracy. Efficiency: We reinterpret CPM as a potential hedonic game by
decomposing its global Hamiltonian into local utility functions, where the
local utility gain of each agent matches the corresponding increase in global
utility. Leveraging this equivalence, we prove that local optimization of the
CPM objective via better-response dynamics converges in pseudo-polynomial time
to an equilibrium partition. Robustness: We introduce and relate two stability
criteria: a strict criterion based on a novel notion of robustness, requiring
nodes to simultaneously maximize neighbors and minimize non-neighbors within
communities, and a relaxed utility function based on a weighted sum of these
objectives, controlled by a resolution parameter. Accuracy: In community
tracking scenarios, where initial partitions are used to bootstrap the Leiden
algorithm with partial ground-truth information, our experiments reveal that
robust partitions yield higher accuracy in recovering ground-truth communities.

TL;DR: CEHR-GPT是一个用于电子健康记录的统一基础模型，集成了特征表示、零样本预测和合成数据生成三大功能，通过时间令牌框架支持临床时序推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI模型多为单一任务设计，限制了在真实医疗场景中的通用性和实用性，需要开发能够处理多种任务的基础模型。

Method: 采用基于时间令牌的学习框架，将患者动态时间线显式编码到模型结构中，支持词汇扩展和微调以适应外部数据集。

Result: CEHR-GPT在三个核心任务上均表现出色，能够有效泛化到外部数据集，支持快速模型开发和患者预后预测。

Conclusion: 该模型为电子健康记录分析提供了统一的多功能解决方案，无需任务特定重新训练即可实现多种临床应用。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) provide a rich, longitudinal view of patient
health and hold significant potential for advancing clinical decision support,
risk prediction, and data-driven healthcare research. However, most artificial
intelligence (AI) models for EHRs are designed for narrow, single-purpose
tasks, limiting their generalizability and utility in real-world settings.
Here, we present CEHR-GPT, a general-purpose foundation model for EHR data that
unifies three essential capabilities - feature representation, zero-shot
prediction, and synthetic data generation - within a single architecture. To
support temporal reasoning over clinical sequences, \cehrgpt{} incorporates a
novel time-token-based learning framework that explicitly encodes patients'
dynamic timelines into the model structure. CEHR-GPT demonstrates strong
performance across all three tasks and generalizes effectively to external
datasets through vocabulary expansion and fine-tuning. Its versatility enables
rapid model development, cohort discovery, and patient outcome forecasting
without the need for task-specific retraining.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理异构目标的学习问题，为实际应用中的多智能体奖励函数设计提供了实用框架

Abstract: Designing suitable reward functions for numerous interacting intelligent
agents is challenging in real-world applications. Inverse reinforcement
learning (IRL) in mean field games (MFGs) offers a practical framework to infer
reward functions from expert demonstrations. While promising, the assumption of
agent homogeneity limits the capability of existing methods to handle
demonstrations with heterogeneous and unknown objectives, which are common in
practice. To this end, we propose a deep latent variable MFG model and an
associated IRL method. Critically, our method can infer rewards from different
yet structurally similar tasks without prior knowledge about underlying
contexts or modifying the MFG model itself. Our experiments, conducted on
simulated scenarios and a real-world spatial taxi-ride pricing problem,
demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art IRL methods
in MFGs.

Conclusion: 对抗性协同进化是学习工具性世界模型的强大方法，能够推动议程向更深层次的战略深度和稳健性发展

Abstract: World models that infer and predict environmental dynamics are foundational
to embodied intelligence. However, their potential is often limited by the
finite complexity and implicit biases of hand-crafted training environments. To
develop truly generalizable and robust agents, we need environments that scale
in complexity alongside the agents learning within them. In this work, we
reframe the challenge of environment generation as the problem of learning a
goal-conditioned, generative world model. We propose a system where a
generative **Attacker** agent learns an implicit world model to synthesize
increasingly difficult challenges for a team of cooperative **Defender**
agents. The Attacker's objective is not passive prediction, but active,
goal-driven interaction: it models and generates world states (i.e.,
configurations of enemy units) specifically to exploit the Defenders'
weaknesses. Concurrently, the embodied Defender team learns a cooperative
policy to overcome these generated worlds. This co-evolutionary dynamic creates
a self-scaling curriculum where the world model continuously adapts to
challenge the decision-making policy of the agents, providing an effectively
infinite stream of novel and relevant training scenarios. We demonstrate that
this framework leads to the emergence of complex behaviors, such as the world
model learning to generate flanking and shielding formations, and the defenders
learning coordinated focus-fire and spreading tactics. Our findings position
adversarial co-evolution as a powerful method for learning instrumental world
models that drive agents toward greater strategic depth and robustness.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了非负矩阵分解(NMF)与共同原因原理(PCC)之间的密切关系，展示了它们在图像数据处理中的相互应用价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究NMF和PCC这两个看似不同的概念之间的内在联系，探索它们在数据降维、因果分析和图像处理中的协同作用。

Method: 通过将灰度图像映射到概率模型，利用PCC提供预测性工具来稳健估计NMF的有效秩，并开发基于NMF的聚类方法和数据去噪技术。

Result: 提出的秩估计方法对弱噪声具有稳定性，NMF在该秩下生成的特征(基础图像)对噪声和局部优化种子也具有稳定性，有效解决了NMF的非可识别性问题。

Conclusion: NMF和PCC之间存在深刻的相互联系，PCC为NMF提供稳健的秩估计，而NMF为PCC提供近似实现方式，两者结合可用于聚类分析和数据去噪。

Abstract: Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a known unsupervised data-reduction
method. The principle of the common cause (PCC) is a basic methodological
approach in probabilistic causality, which seeks an independent mixture model
for the joint probability of two dependent random variables. It turns out that
these two concepts are closely related. This relationship is explored
reciprocally for several datasets of gray-scale images, which are conveniently
mapped into probability models. On one hand, PCC provides a predictability tool
that leads to a robust estimation of the effective rank of NMF. Unlike other
estimates (e.g., those based on the Bayesian Information Criteria), our
estimate of the rank is stable against weak noise. We show that NMF implemented
around this rank produces features (basis images) that are also stable against
noise and against seeds of local optimization, thereby effectively resolving
the NMF nonidentifiability problem. On the other hand, NMF provides an
interesting possibility of implementing PCC in an approximate way, where larger
and positively correlated joint probabilities tend to be explained better via
the independent mixture model. We work out a clustering method, where data
points with the same common cause are grouped into the same cluster. We also
show how NMF can be employed for data denoising.

TL;DR: FedDeCAB是一种半去中心化的联邦学习客户端选择方法，针对物联网场景中时间序列数据的客户端可用性问题，通过概率排名和邻居参数共享机制提升模型性能并减少通信开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在物联网场景中面临数据异构性、客户端能量和可用性预算有限的问题，特别是时间序列数据的客户端可用性对训练性能有重要影响，需要有效的客户端选择机制来保证全局模型收敛和客户端贡献平衡。

Method: 提出FedDeCAB方法：1）设置三种影响时间序列数据可用性的场景；2）使用概率排名选择可用客户端；3）当客户端断开连接时，从最近邻客户端获取部分模型参数进行联合优化。

Result: 基于真实世界的大规模出租车和船舶轨迹数据集的实验表明，FedDeCAB在高度异构数据分布、有限通信预算和动态客户端离线或重新加入的情况下都表现有效。

Conclusion: FedDeCAB通过半去中心化的客户端选择和邻居参数共享机制，有效解决了联邦学习在物联网场景中的客户端可用性问题，提高了离线模型性能并减少了通信开销。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) effectively promotes collaborative training among
distributed clients with privacy considerations in the Internet of Things (IoT)
scenarios. Despite of data heterogeneity, FL clients may also be constrained by
limited energy and availability budgets. Therefore, effective selection of
clients participating in training is of vital importance for the convergence of
the global model and the balance of client contributions. In this paper, we
discuss the performance impact of client availability with time-series data on
federated learning. We set up three different scenarios that affect the
availability of time-series data and propose FedDeCAB, a novel,
semi-decentralized client selection method applying probabilistic rankings of
available clients. When a client is disconnected from the server, FedDeCAB
allows obtaining partial model parameters from the nearest neighbor clients for
joint optimization, improving the performance of offline models and reducing
communication overhead. Experiments based on real-world large-scale taxi and
vessel trajectory datasets show that FedDeCAB is effective under highly
heterogeneous data distribution, limited communication budget, and dynamic
client offline or rejoining.

TL;DR: SharedRep-RLHF是一个新的RLHF框架，通过学习群体间的共享特征而不是单独学习群体特定的奖励模型，解决了MaxMin-RLHF在少数群体表现不佳的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的统一奖励RLHF无法捕捉不同子群体的意见多样性，偏向主导群体。MaxMin-RLHF虽然通过群体特定奖励模型促进公平，但在少数群体作为最小奖励群体时表现不佳。

Method: 提出SharedRep-RLHF框架，核心思想是学习不同群体标注中的共享特征，而不是为每个群体学习单独的奖励模型。

Result: 实验证明SharedRep-RLHF相比MaxMin-RLHF在多种自然语言任务上效果更好，胜率提升高达20%。

Conclusion: SharedRep-RLHF通过利用群体间的共享特征，有效解决了MaxMin-RLHF在少数群体上的性能限制，提供了更好的公平性和性能表现。

Abstract: Uniform-reward reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which
trains a single reward model to represent the preferences of all annotators,
fails to capture the diversity of opinions across sub-populations,
inadvertently favoring dominant groups. The state-of-the-art, MaxMin-RLHF,
addresses this by learning group-specific reward models, and by optimizing for
the group receiving the minimum reward, thereby promoting fairness. However, we
identify that a key limitation of MaxMin-RLHF is its poor performance when the
minimum-reward group is a minority. To mitigate this drawback, we introduce a
novel framework, termed {\em SharedRep-RLHF}. At its core, SharedRep-RLHF
learns and leverages {\em shared traits} in annotations among various groups,
in contrast to learning separate reward models across groups. We first show
that MaxMin-RLHF is provably suboptimal in learning shared traits, and then
quantify the sample complexity of SharedRep-RLHF. Experiments across diverse
natural language tasks showcase the effectiveness of SharedRep-RLHF compared to
MaxMin-RLHF with a gain of up to 20% in win rate.

Abstract: Based on economic theories and integrated with machine learning technology,
this study explores a collaborative Supply Chain Management and Financial
Supply Chain Management (SCM - FSCM) model to solve issues like efficiency
loss, financing constraints, and risk transmission. We combine Transaction Cost
and Information Asymmetry theories and use algorithms such as random forests to
process multi-dimensional data and build a data-driven, three-dimensional
(cost-efficiency-risk) analysis framework. We then apply an FSCM model of "core
enterprise credit empowerment plus dynamic pledge financing." We use Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for demand forecasting and
clustering/regression algorithms for benefit allocation. The study also
combines Game Theory and reinforcement learning to optimize the
inventory-procurement mechanism and uses eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
for credit assessment to enable rapid monetization of inventory. Verified with
20 core and 100 supporting enterprises, the results show a 30\% increase in
inventory turnover, an 18\%-22\% decrease in SME financing costs, a stable
order fulfillment rate above 95\%, and excellent model performance (demand
forecasting error <= 8\%, credit assessment accuracy >= 90\%). This SCM-FSCM
model effectively reduces operating costs, alleviates financing constraints,
and supports high-quality supply chain development.

Abstract: Gradient dynamics play a central role in determining the stability and
generalization of deep neural networks. In this work, we provide an empirical
analysis of how variance and standard deviation of gradients evolve during
training, showing consistent changes across layers and at the global scale in
convolutional networks. Motivated by these observations, we propose a
hyperparameter-free gradient normalization method that aligns gradient scaling
with their natural evolution. This approach prevents unintended amplification,
stabilizes optimization, and preserves convergence guarantees. Experiments on
the challenging CIFAR-100 benchmark with ResNet-20, ResNet-56, and VGG-16-BN
demonstrate that our method maintains or improves test accuracy even under
strong generalization. Beyond practical performance, our study highlights the
importance of directly tracking gradient dynamics, aiming to bridge the gap
between theoretical expectations and empirical behaviors, and to provide
insights for future optimization research.

Abstract: We study the application of graph random features (GRFs) - a recently

Abstract: The rise of foundation models (FMs) has reshaped the landscape of machine
learning. As these models continued to grow, leveraging geo-distributed data
from wireless devices has become increasingly critical, giving rise to
federated foundation models (FFMs). More recently, FMs have evolved into
multi-modal multi-task (M3T) FMs (e.g., GPT-4) capable of processing diverse
modalities across multiple tasks, which motivates a new underexplored paradigm:
M3T FFMs. In this paper, we unveil an unexplored variation of M3T FFMs by
proposing hierarchical federated foundation models (HF-FMs), which in turn
expose two overlooked heterogeneity dimensions to fog/edge networks that have a
direct impact on these emerging models: (i) heterogeneity in collected
modalities and (ii) heterogeneity in executed tasks across fog/edge nodes.
HF-FMs strategically align the modular structure of M3T FMs, comprising
modality encoders, prompts, mixture-of-experts (MoEs), adapters, and task
heads, with the hierarchical nature of fog/edge infrastructures. Moreover,
HF-FMs enable the optional usage of device-to-device (D2D) communications,
enabling horizontal module relaying and localized cooperative training among
nodes when feasible. Through delving into the architectural design of HF-FMs,
we highlight their unique capabilities along with a series of tailored future
research directions. Finally, to demonstrate their potential, we prototype
HF-FMs in a wireless network setting and release the open-source code for the
development of HF-FMs with the goal of fostering exploration in this untapped
field (GitHub: https://github.com/payamsiabd/M3T-FFM).

*Tristan Luca Saidi,Abigail Hickok,Bastian Rieck,Andrew J. Blumberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EmbedOR是一种新的随机邻域嵌入算法，通过引入离散图曲率来更好地保持高维噪声数据的几何结构，解决了UMAP和tSNE等算法容易错误分离连通分量的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SNE算法如UMAP和tSNE在处理噪声高维数据时，往往无法保持数据的几何结构，会错误地分离本应连通的子流形分量，并且在良好可分簇的数据中可能无法正确识别簇结构。

Method: 提出了EmbedOR算法，通过引入离散图曲率来增强距离度量，强调底层簇结构。该算法使用曲率增强的距离度量进行随机嵌入，并证明了该距离度量将tSNE的一致性结果扩展到更广泛的数据集类别。

Result: 在合成和真实数据上的大量实验表明，EmbedOR在可视化和几何保持方面表现优异。与其他SNE算法和UMAP相比，EmbedOR不太可能将连续的高密度数据区域碎片化。

Conclusion: EmbedOR距离度量不仅可以作为可视化工具，还可以用于注释现有可视化结果，识别碎片化问题，并提供对数据底层几何结构的更深入洞察。

Abstract: Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (SNE) algorithms like UMAP and tSNE often
produce visualizations that do not preserve the geometry of noisy and high
dimensional data. In particular, they can spuriously separate connected
components of the underlying data submanifold and can fail to find clusters in
well-clusterable data. To address these limitations, we propose EmbedOR, a SNE
algorithm that incorporates discrete graph curvature. Our algorithm
stochastically embeds the data using a curvature-enhanced distance metric that
emphasizes underlying cluster structure. Critically, we prove that the EmbedOR
distance metric extends consistency results for tSNE to a much broader class of
datasets. We also describe extensive experiments on synthetic and real data
that demonstrate the visualization and geometry-preservation capabilities of
EmbedOR. We find that, unlike other SNE algorithms and UMAP, EmbedOR is much
less likely to fragment continuous, high-density regions of the data. Finally,
we demonstrate that the EmbedOR distance metric can be used as a tool to
annotate existing visualizations to identify fragmentation and provide deeper
insight into the underlying geometry of the data.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在线测试问题(OTP)，通过探索-利用权衡在测试成本和相关性的约束下，为连续受试者选择最优测试子集。证明了缺失数据导致的最小最大遗憾下界为Ω(T^{2/3})，高于标准MDP的Θ(√T)，并提出了匹配该上界的算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在实际测试场景中，对每个受试者进行全部测试成本高昂且不必要，但如何在线学习最优测试策略，在测试相关性和成本约束下做出基于部分信息的决策是一个重要问题。

Method: 将问题建模为马尔可夫决策过程(MDP)，提出Explore-Then-Commit算法处理未知分布和缺失数据问题，并针对奖励与缺失数据无关的变体问题设计了迭代消除算法。

Result: 证明了OTP问题的最小最大遗憾下界为Ω(T^{2/3})，提出的算法实现了Õ(T^{2/3})的累积遗憾。对于奖励与缺失数据无关的变体问题，实现了Õ(√T)的遗憾，突破了OTP的下界。

Conclusion: 缺失数据显著增加了在线学习的难度，本文工作深化了对缺失数据下探索-利用权衡的理解，为设计高效的顺序测试策略提供了指导。

Abstract: This paper studies an online learning problem that seeks optimal testing
policies for a stream of subjects, each of whom can be evaluated through a
sequence of candidate tests drawn from a common pool. We refer to this problem
as the Online Testing Problem (OTP). Although conducting every candidate test
for a subject provides more information, it is often preferable to select only
a subset when tests are correlated and costly, and make decisions with partial
information. If the joint distribution of test outcomes were known, the problem
could be cast as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and solved exactly. In
practice, this distribution is unknown and must be learned online as subjects
are tested. When a subject is not fully tested, the resulting missing data can
bias estimates, making the problem fundamentally harder than standard episodic
MDPs. We prove that the minimax regret must scale at least as
$\Omega(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$, in contrast to the $\Theta(\sqrt{T})$ rate in
episodic MDPs, revealing the difficulty introduced by missingness. This
elevated lower bound is then matched by an Explore-Then-Commit algorithm whose
cumulative regret is $\tilde{O}(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$ for both discrete and
Gaussian distributions. To highlight the consequence of missingness-dependent
rewards in OTP, we study a variant called the Online Cost-sensitive Maximum
Entropy Sampling Problem, where rewards are independent of missing data. This
structure enables an iterative-elimination algorithm that achieves
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret, breaking the $\Omega(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$ lower
bound for OTP. Numerical results confirm our theory in both settings. Overall,
this work deepens the understanding of the exploration--exploitation trade-off
under missing data and guides the design of efficient sequential testing
policies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了可微分范围分区熵估计器，使算法能根据输入数据的"有序性"自适应调整，并应用于几何算法和Transformer注意力机制，在保持正确性的同时显著提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 范围分区熵在算法设计中提供了强大保证，但尚未应用于深度学习。为了让深度学习也能利用这一概念来适应输入数据的排序特性并提升效率，需要开发可微分的熵估计方法。

Method: 1) 提出首个可微分范围分区熵近似估计器，可作为可训练损失或正则化项；2) 设计EntropyNet神经网络模块，将数据重组为低熵形式以加速下游实例最优算法；3) 将熵正则化直接应用于Transformer注意力机制。

Result: 在几何任务中实现最高4.1倍运行速度提升，误差可忽略(<0.2%)；在深度学习中，诱导结构化注意力模式，在80%稀疏度下比L1基线准确率高6%。理论分析提供了估计器的近似边界。

Conclusion: 熵有界计算不仅是理论优雅的概念，更是实现自适应学习、效率和结构化表示的实际机制，可微分熵在不降低正确性的前提下显著改善计算效率。

Abstract: We introduce a differentiable estimator of range-partition entropy, a recent
concept from computational geometry that enables algorithms to adapt to the
"sortedness" of their input. While range-partition entropy provides strong
guarantees in algorithm design, it has not yet been made accessible to deep
learning. In this work, we (i) propose the first differentiable approximation
of range-partition entropy, enabling its use as a trainable loss or
regularizer; (ii) design EntropyNet, a neural module that restructures data
into low-entropy forms to accelerate downstream instance-optimal algorithms;
and (iii) extend this principle beyond geometry by applying entropy
regularization directly to Transformer attention. Across tasks, we demonstrate
that differentiable entropy improves efficiency without degrading correctness:
in geometry, our method achieves up to $4.1\times$ runtime speedups with
negligible error ($<0.2%$); in deep learning, it induces structured attention
patterns that yield 6% higher accuracy at 80% sparsity compared to L1
baselines. Our theoretical analysis provides approximation bounds for the
estimator, and extensive ablations validate design choices. These results
suggest that entropy-bounded computation is not only theoretically elegant but
also a practical mechanism for adaptive learning, efficiency, and structured
representation.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个将稀疏自编码器扩展到提升空间和无限维函数空间的框架，用于统一神经模型的表示并实现大型神经算子的机制可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然柏拉图表示假说认为神经网络在不同架构中会收敛到相似的表示，但神经算子的表示特性在科学计算中日益重要却仍未得到充分探索。

Method: 扩展稀疏自编码器(SAE)到提升空间和无限维函数空间，比较SAE、提升SAE和SAE神经算子的推理和训练动态。

Result: 提升和算子模块引入了有益的归纳偏置，实现了更快的恢复、改进的平滑概念恢复，以及跨不同分辨率的鲁棒推理。

Conclusion: 该框架为神经算子的机制可解释性提供了有效方法，展示了提升和算子方法在表示统一中的优势。

Abstract: We frame the problem of unifying representations in neural models as one of
sparse model recovery and introduce a framework that extends sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to lifted spaces and infinite-dimensional function spaces,
enabling mechanistic interpretability of large neural operators (NO). While the
Platonic Representation Hypothesis suggests that neural networks converge to
similar representations across architectures, the representational properties
of neural operators remain underexplored despite their growing importance in
scientific computing. We compare the inference and training dynamics of SAEs,
lifted-SAE, and SAE neural operators. We highlight how lifting and operator
modules introduce beneficial inductive biases, enabling faster recovery,
improved recovery of smooth concepts, and robust inference across varying
resolutions, a property unique to neural operators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星图像机器学习应用中存在标签训练数据稀疏、空间聚集且收集成本异质性的问题，过去研究多关注模型等技术问题，而忽视了数据收集优化的重要性。

Method: 提出了首个空间训练数据优化问题形式化，考虑异质性数据收集成本和实际预算约束，并提出了新的优化方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为卫星图像机器学习领域提供了通用的数据优化框架，并在外援合作伙伴的多哥农业监测项目中得到了立即应用。

Abstract: In applications across agriculture, ecology, and human development, machine
learning with satellite imagery (SatML) is limited by the sparsity of labeled
training data. While satellite data cover the globe, labeled training datasets
for SatML are often small, spatially clustered, and collected for other
purposes (e.g., administrative surveys or field measurements). Despite the
pervasiveness of this issue in practice, past SatML research has largely
focused on new model architectures and training algorithms to handle scarce
training data, rather than modeling data conditions directly. This leaves
scientists and policymakers who wish to use SatML for large-scale monitoring
uncertain about whether and how to collect additional data to maximize
performance. Here, we present the first problem formulation for the
optimization of spatial training data in the presence of heterogeneous data
collection costs and realistic budget constraints, as well as novel methods for
addressing this problem. In experiments simulating different problem settings
across three continents and four tasks, our strategies reveal substantial gains
from sample optimization. Further experiments delineate settings for which
optimized sampling is particularly effective. The problem formulation and
methods we introduce are designed to generalize across application domains for
SatML; we put special emphasis on a specific problem setting where our
coauthors can immediately use our findings to augment clustered agricultural
surveys for SatML monitoring in Togo.

Result: 数值实验（包括稀疏CT重建应用）显示该方法在精度和效率上优于传统前馈神经网络和插值方法

Conclusion: 该方法为流形上的函数逼近提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案，特别适用于高维数据处理

Abstract: We propose a data-driven method for approximating real-valued functions on
smooth manifolds, building on the Diffusion Maps framework under the manifold
hypothesis. Given pointwise evaluations of a function, the method constructs a
smooth extension to the ambient space by exploiting diffusion geometry and its
connection to the heat equation and the Laplace-Beltrami operator.
  To address the computational challenges of high-dimensional data, we
introduce a dimensionality reduction strategy based on the low-rank structure
of the distance matrix, revealed via singular value decomposition (SVD). In
addition, we develop an online updating mechanism that enables efficient
incorporation of new data, thereby improving scalability and reducing
computational cost.
  Numerical experiments, including applications to sparse CT reconstruction,
demonstrate that the proposed methodology outperforms classical feedforward
neural networks and interpolation methods in terms of both accuracy and
efficiency.

Motivation: 探索奖励函数的基本属性如何实现高效的稀疏奖励强化学习，特别是低秩结构在奖励矩阵中的作用

Method: 提出Policy-Aware Matrix Completion (PAMC)方法，将矩阵补全理论与强化学习结合，通过策略依赖采样分析实现奖励无关的表征学习、分布无关的置信集和鲁棒补全保证

Result: 在100个系统采样领域中发现超过一半存在可利用结构，PAMC相比强基线方法样本效率提升1.6-2.1倍，仅增加约20%计算开销

Conclusion: 结构化奖励学习是一个有前景的新范式，对机器人、医疗等安全关键、样本昂贵的应用具有直接意义

Abstract: What fundamental properties of reward functions enable efficient
sparse-reward reinforcement learning? We address this question through the lens
of low-rank structure in reward matrices, showing that such structure induces a
sharp transition from exponential to polynomial sample complexity, the first
result of this kind for sparse-reward RL. We introduce Policy-Aware Matrix
Completion (PAMC), which connects matrix completion theory with reinforcement
learning via a new analysis of policy-dependent sampling. Our framework
provides: (i) impossibility results for general sparse reward observation, (ii)
reward-free representation learning from dynamics, (iii) distribution-free
confidence sets via conformal prediction, and (iv) robust completion guarantees
that degrade gracefully when low-rank structure is only approximate.
Empirically, we conduct a pre-registered evaluation across 100 systematically
sampled domains, finding exploitable structure in over half. PAMC improves
sample efficiency by factors between 1.6 and 2.1 compared to strong
exploration, structured, and representation-learning baselines, while adding
only about 20 percent computational overhead.These results establish structural
reward learning as a promising new paradigm, with immediate implications for
robotics, healthcare, and other safety-critical, sample-expensive applications.

TL;DR: ADAPT-Z是一种针对时间序列在线学习的创新方法，通过更新潜在因素的表示而非传统参数选择，解决了分布漂移和延迟反馈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列预测面临分布漂移的挑战，特别是在在线部署场景中数据顺序到达时。传统方法关注参数选择和更新策略，但作者认为分布漂移源于潜在因素的变化，因此需要更新特征表示。多步预测中的延迟反馈问题也需要解决。

Method: 提出ADAPT-Z方法，使用适配器模块结合当前特征表示和历史梯度信息，在延迟情况下实现稳健的参数更新。该方法专注于更新潜在因素的特征表示而非传统参数。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在多个数据集上持续优于无适应的基准模型，并超越了最先进的在线学习方法。

Conclusion: ADAPT-Z通过更新潜在因素的特征表示有效解决了时间序列在线学习中的分布漂移和延迟反馈问题，为在线时间序列预测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is of significant importance across various domains.
However, it faces significant challenges due to distribution shift. This issue
becomes particularly pronounced in online deployment scenarios where data
arrives sequentially, requiring models to adapt continually to evolving
patterns. Current time series online learning methods focus on two main
aspects: selecting suitable parameters to update (e.g., final layer weights or
adapter modules) and devising suitable update strategies (e.g., using recent
batches, replay buffers, or averaged gradients). We challenge the conventional
parameter selection approach, proposing that distribution shifts stem from
changes in underlying latent factors influencing the data. Consequently,
updating the feature representations of these latent factors may be more
effective. To address the critical problem of delayed feedback in multi-step
forecasting (where true values arrive much later than predictions), we
introduce ADAPT-Z (Automatic Delta Adjustment via Persistent Tracking in
Z-space). ADAPT-Z utilizes an adapter module that leverages current feature
representations combined with historical gradient information to enable robust
parameter updates despite the delay. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms standard base models without adaptation and
surpasses state-of-the-art online learning approaches across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: 该框架能够生成具有散射意识的环境地图和数字双胞，支持适应性政杖管理、阻塞恢复和环境感知连接等下一代网络应用。

Abstract: Reliable connectivity in millimeter-wave (mmWave) and sub-terahertz (sub-THz)
networks depends on reflections from surrounding surfaces, as high-frequency
signals are highly vulnerable to blockage. The scattering behavior of a surface
is determined not only by material permittivity but also by roughness, which
governs whether energy remains in the specular direction or is diffusely
scattered. This paper presents a LiDAR-driven machine learning framework for
classifying indoor surfaces into semi-specular and low-specular categories,
using optical reflectivity as a proxy for electromagnetic scattering behavior.
A dataset of over 78,000 points from 15 representative indoor materials was
collected and partitioned into 3 cm x 3 cm patches to enable classification
from partial views. Patch-level features capturing geometry and intensity,
including elevation angle, natural-log-scaled intensity, and max-to-mean ratio,
were extracted and used to train Random Forest, XGBoost, and neural network
classifiers. Results show that ensemble tree-based models consistently provide
the best trade-off between accuracy and robustness, confirming that
LiDAR-derived features capture roughness-induced scattering effects. The
proposed framework enables the generation of scatter aware environment maps and
digital twins, supporting adaptive beam management, blockage recovery, and
environment-aware connectivity in next-generation networks.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of communication link quality metrics is essential for
vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) systems, enabling smooth handovers, efficient
beam management, and reliable low-latency communication. The increasing
availability of sensor data from modern vehicles motivates the use of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) because of their adaptability across
tasks and reasoning capabilities. However, MLLMs inherently lack
three-dimensional spatial understanding. To overcome this limitation, a
lightweight, plug-and-play bird's-eye view (BEV) injection connector is
proposed. In this framework, a BEV of the environment is constructed by
collecting sensing data from neighboring vehicles. This BEV representation is
then fused with the ego vehicle's input to provide spatial context for the
large language model. To support realistic multimodal learning, a co-simulation
environment combining CARLA simulator and MATLAB-based ray tracing is developed
to generate RGB, LiDAR, GPS, and wireless signal data across varied scenarios.
Instructions and ground-truth responses are programmatically extracted from the
ray-tracing outputs. Extensive experiments are conducted across three V2I link
prediction tasks: line-of-sight (LoS) versus non-line-of-sight (NLoS)
classification, link availability, and blockage prediction. Simulation results
show that the proposed BEV injection framework consistently improved
performance across all tasks. The results indicate that, compared to an
ego-only baseline, the proposed approach improves the macro-average of the
accuracy metrics by up to 13.9%. The results also show that this performance
gain increases by up to 32.7% under challenging rainy and nighttime conditions,
confirming the robustness of the framework in adverse settings.

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) and Knowledge Distillation (KD) are
combined to achieve competitive performance in creating low-bit deep learning
models. Existing KD and QAT works focus on improving the accuracy of quantized
models from the network output perspective by designing better KD loss
functions or optimizing QAT's forward and backward propagation. However,
limited attention has been given to understanding the impact of input
transformations, such as data augmentation (DA). The relationship between
quantization-aware KD and DA remains unexplored. In this paper, we address the
question: how to select a good DA in quantization-aware KD, especially for the
models with low precisions? We propose a novel metric which evaluates DAs
according to their capacity to maximize the Contextual Mutual Information--the
information not directly related to an image's label--while also ensuring the
predictions for each class are close to the ground truth labels on average. The
proposed method automatically ranks and selects DAs, requiring minimal training
overhead, and it is compatible with any KD or QAT algorithm. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that selecting DA strategies using our metric
significantly improves state-of-the-art QAT and KD works across various model
architectures and datasets.

TL;DR: 提出MillGNN方法，通过多尺度分组学习领先-滞后依赖关系，改进多变量时间序列预测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了多分组尺度下的领先-滞后依赖关系，无法捕捉复杂系统中的分层领先-滞后效应

Method: 使用图神经网络，包含尺度特定领先-滞后图学习模块和分层领先-滞后消息传递模块

Result: 在11个数据集上优于16种最先进方法，在长短期预测中均表现优越

Conclusion: MillGNN能全面捕捉变量级和组级动态的领先-滞后效应，平衡全面性和效率

Abstract: Multi-variate time series (MTS) forecasting is crucial for various
applications. Existing methods have shown promising results owing to their
strong ability to capture intra- and inter-variate dependencies. However, these
methods often overlook lead-lag dependencies at multiple grouping scales,
failing to capture hierarchical lead-lag effects in complex systems. To this
end, we propose MillGNN, a novel \underline{g}raph \underline{n}eural
\underline{n}etwork-based method that learns \underline{m}ult\underline{i}ple
grouping scale \underline{l}ead-\underline{l}ag dependencies for MTS
forecasting, which can comprehensively capture lead-lag effects considering
variate-wise and group-wise dynamics and decays. Specifically, MillGNN
introduces two key innovations: (1) a scale-specific lead-lag graph learning
module that integrates cross-correlation coefficients and dynamic decaying
features derived from real-time inputs and time lags to learn lead-lag
dependencies for each scale, which can model evolving lead-lag dependencies
with statistical interpretability and data-driven flexibility; (2) a
hierarchical lead-lag message passing module that passes lead-lag messages at
multiple grouping scales in a structured way to simultaneously propagate intra-
and inter-scale lead-lag effects, which can capture multi-scale lead-lag
effects with a balance of comprehensiveness and efficiency. Experimental
results on 11 datasets demonstrate the superiority of MillGNN for long-term and
short-term MTS forecasting, compared with 16 state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 冠心病是全球主要死因且医疗支出巨大，需要开发非侵入性诊断方法

Method: 使用遗传算法筛选50个关键尿液肽生物标志物，采用SMOTE平衡处理组和对照组（各345人），构建三层隐藏层（每层60个神经元）的MLP神经网络

Conclusion: 该模型为冠心病提供了高精度、稳健的非侵入性诊断工具

Abstract: Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a leading cause of death worldwide and
contributes significantly to annual healthcare expenditures. To develop a
non-invasive diagnostic approach, we designed a model based on a multilayer
perceptron (MLP) neural network, trained on 50 key urinary peptide biomarkers
selected via genetic algorithms. Treatment and control groups, each comprising
345 individuals, were balanced using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling
Technique (SMOTE). The neural network was trained using a stratified validation
strategy. Using a network with three hidden layers of 60 neurons each and an
output layer of two neurons, the model achieved a precision, sensitivity, and
specificity of 95.67 percent, with an F1-score of 0.9565. The area under the
ROC curve (AUC) reached 0.9748 for both classes, while the Matthews correlation
coefficient (MCC) and Cohen's kappa coefficient were 0.9134 and 0.9131,
respectively, demonstrating its reliability in detecting CHD. These results
indicate that the model provides a highly accurate and robust non-invasive
diagnostic tool for coronary heart disease.

TL;DR: Topotein是一个基于拓扑深度学习的蛋白质表示学习框架，通过蛋白质组合复合体(PCC)和拓扑完全感知网络(TCPNet)在多层次上捕捉蛋白质结构信息，在多个任务中优于现有几何图神经网络。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于序列和图的蛋白质表示学习方法无法有效捕捉蛋白质结构固有的层次化组织特征，需要开发能够理解多尺度结构模式的表示学习方法。

Method: 提出蛋白质组合复合体(PCC)在多个层次（残基、二级结构、完整蛋白质）表示蛋白质并保持几何信息，使用TCPNet进行SE(3)-等变消息传递来捕捉多尺度结构模式。

Result: 在四个蛋白质表示学习任务中，TCPNet始终优于最先进的几何图神经网络，特别是在需要理解二级结构排列的折叠分类任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: 层次化拓扑特征对于蛋白质分析具有重要意义，Topotein框架验证了拓扑深度学习在蛋白质表示学习中的有效性。

Abstract: Protein representation learning (PRL) is crucial for understanding
structure-function relationships, yet current sequence- and graph-based methods
fail to capture the hierarchical organization inherent in protein structures.
We introduce Topotein, a comprehensive framework that applies topological deep
learning to PRL through the novel Protein Combinatorial Complex (PCC) and
Topology-Complete Perceptron Network (TCPNet). Our PCC represents proteins at
multiple hierarchical levels -- from residues to secondary structures to
complete proteins -- while preserving geometric information at each level.
TCPNet employs SE(3)-equivariant message passing across these hierarchical
structures, enabling more effective capture of multi-scale structural patterns.
Through extensive experiments on four PRL tasks, TCPNet consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art geometric graph neural networks. Our approach
demonstrates particular strength in tasks such as fold classification which
require understanding of secondary structure arrangements, validating the
importance of hierarchical topological features for protein analysis.

Method: 使用正式验证工具Marabou来验证神经网络模型的本地稳健性，量化模型输入在不影响输出行为的情况下可扰动的最大范围

Result: 通过正式验证提高了神经网络模型在不确定性条件下的可靠性和可信过性

Abstract: Failures in satellite components are costly and challenging to address, often
requiring significant human and material resources. Embedding a hybrid AI-based
system for fault detection directly in the satellite can greatly reduce this
burden by allowing earlier detection. However, such systems must operate with
extremely high reliability. To ensure this level of dependability, we employ
the formal verification tool Marabou to verify the local robustness of the
neural network models used in the AI-based algorithm. This tool allows us to
quantify how much a model's input can be perturbed before its output behavior
becomes unstable, thereby improving trustworthiness with respect to its
performance under uncertainty.

Motivation: 现代机器学习模型在医疗应用中虽然性能高，但并不总能捕捉到临床专家所需的模式，存在模型行为与临床经验学习之间的不一致问题。

Method: 通过调查收集临床知识，将其作为约束条件整合到ML模型中，分析不同程度欠规范下的模型性能和行为影响，并采用随机实验验证反馈驱动的对齐方法。

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了医疗ML模型与临床知识的对齐，为改善医疗AI模型的可解释性和临床实用性提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Over the past decade, the use of machine learning (ML) models in healthcare
applications has rapidly increased. Despite high performance, modern ML models
do not always capture patterns the end user requires. For example, a model may
predict a non-monotonically decreasing relationship between cancer stage and
survival, keeping all other features fixed. In this paper, we present a
reproducible framework for investigating this misalignment between model
behavior and clinical experiential learning, focusing on the effects of
underspecification of modern ML pipelines. In a prostate cancer outcome
prediction case study, we first identify and address these inconsistencies by
incorporating clinical knowledge, collected by a survey, via constraints into
the ML model, and subsequently analyze the impact on model performance and
behavior across degrees of underspecification. The approach shows that aligning
the ML model with clinical experiential learning is possible without
compromising performance. Motivated by recent literature in generative AI, we
further examine the feasibility of a feedback-driven alignment approach in
non-generative AI clinical risk prediction models through a randomized
experiment with clinicians. Our findings illustrate that, by eliciting
clinicians' model preferences using our proposed methodology, the larger the
difference in how the constrained and unconstrained models make predictions for
a patient, the more apparent the difference is in clinical interpretation.

Motivation: 联邦学习中数据异构性（特别是小规模和类别不平衡的数据集）对全局模型泛化能力构成挑战，需要新的方法来减少模型聚合对全局模型的负面影响

Method: 提出FedQuad方法，显式优化类内方差和类间方差，最小化相似对距离同时最大化负对距离，在共享特征空间中有效解耦客户端数据

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上，在各种数据分布和大量客户端设置下，相比现有方法表现出优越性能

Conclusion: 基于度量学习的策略在监督学习和联邦学习范式中都能有效解决联邦设置中的表示学习挑战，FedQuad为解决数据异构性问题提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) provides decentralised model training, which
effectively tackles problems such as distributed data and privacy preservation.
However, the generalisation of global models frequently faces challenges from
data heterogeneity among clients. This challenge becomes even more pronounced
when datasets are limited in size and class imbalance. To address data
heterogeneity, we propose a novel method, \textit{FedQuad}, that explicitly
optimises smaller intra-class variance and larger inter-class variance across
clients, thereby decreasing the negative impact of model aggregation on the
global model over client representations. Our approach minimises the distance
between similar pairs while maximising the distance between negative pairs,
effectively disentangling client data in the shared feature space. We evaluate
our method on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets under various data
distributions and with many clients, demonstrating superior performance
compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of
metric learning-based strategies within both supervised and federated learning
paradigms, highlighting their efficacy in addressing representational learning
challenges in federated settings.

TL;DR: SP-CCI是一种新的反事实推理框架，通过合成数据增强校准集，在保持边际覆盖率的同时显著减少预测区间宽度，特别是在治疗不平衡情况下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的反事实推理方法虽然提供边际覆盖保证，但往往产生过于保守的区间，特别是在反事实样本稀缺的治疗不平衡情况下，需要更精确的预测区间。

Method: 提出SP-CCI框架，使用预训练的反事实模型生成合成反事实标签来增强校准集，结合风险控制预测集(RCPS)和预测驱动推理(PPI)的去偏步骤来确保有效性。

Result: 理论证明SP-CCI在保持边际覆盖率的同时获得更紧致的预测区间，实证结果在不同数据集上显示SP-CCI相比标准CCI方法在所有设置下都显著减少区间宽度。

Conclusion: SP-CCI通过合成数据增强和去偏校准，有效解决了反事实推理中区间过度保守的问题，为个体反事实结果提供了更精确可靠的预测区间。

Abstract: This work addresses the problem of constructing reliable prediction intervals
for individual counterfactual outcomes. Existing conformal counterfactual
inference (CCI) methods provide marginal coverage guarantees but often produce
overly conservative intervals, particularly under treatment imbalance when
counterfactual samples are scarce. We introduce synthetic data-powered CCI
(SP-CCI), a new framework that augments the calibration set with synthetic
counterfactual labels generated by a pre-trained counterfactual model. To
ensure validity, SP-CCI incorporates synthetic samples into a conformal
calibration procedure based on risk-controlling prediction sets (RCPS) with a
debiasing step informed by prediction-powered inference (PPI). We prove that
SP-CCI achieves tighter prediction intervals while preserving marginal
coverage, with theoretical guarantees under both exact and approximate
importance weighting. Empirical results on different datasets confirm that
SP-CCI consistently reduces interval width compared to standard CCI across all
settings.

<details>

Motivation: 随着机器学习在敏感决策中的应用增加，算法追索（提供可行动步骤来逆转负面决策）的需求日益重要，但现有方法在追索过程中的公平性保障存在不足。

Method: 提出了MISOB算法，基于社会负担的公平性框架，通过理论分析将追索公平性与分类公平性联系起来，并超越了传统的平等成本范式。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的实验结果表明，MISOB能够在不影响整体分类器准确性的情况下，显著降低所有群体的社会负担。

Conclusion: 该研究为算法追索中的不公平问题提供了全面的理论特征描述和实用的解决方案，推动了公平机器学习在现实世界应用中的发展。

Abstract: Machine learning based predictions are increasingly used in sensitive
decision-making applications that directly affect our lives. This has led to
extensive research into ensuring the fairness of classifiers. Beyond just fair
classification, emerging legislation now mandates that when a classifier
delivers a negative decision, it must also offer actionable steps an individual
can take to reverse that outcome. This concept is known as algorithmic
recourse. Nevertheless, many researchers have expressed concerns about the
fairness guarantees within the recourse process itself. In this work, we
provide a holistic theoretical characterization of unfairness in algorithmic
recourse, formally linking fairness guarantees in recourse and classification,
and highlighting limitations of the standard equal cost paradigm. We then
introduce a novel fairness framework based on social burden, along with a
practical algorithm (MISOB), broadly applicable under real-world conditions.
Empirical results on real-world datasets show that MISOB reduces the social
burden across all groups without compromising overall classifier accuracy.

Abstract: The generation of data is a common approach to improve the performance of
machine learning tasks, among which is the training of models for
classification. In this paper, we present TAGAL, a collection of methods able
to generate synthetic tabular data using an agentic workflow. The methods
leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for an automatic and iterative process
that uses feedback to improve the generated data without any further LLM
training. The use of LLMs also allows for the addition of external knowledge in
the generation process. We evaluate TAGAL across diverse datasets and different
aspects of quality for the generated data. We look at the utility of downstream
ML models, both by training classifiers on synthetic data only and by combining
real and synthetic data. Moreover, we compare the similarities between the real
and the generated data. We show that TAGAL is able to perform on par with
state-of-the-art approaches that require LLM training and generally outperforms
other training-free approaches. These findings highlight the potential of
agentic workflow and open new directions for LLM-based data generation methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统注意力机制直接比较查询和键，缺乏对序列动态特性的建模。AFA旨在通过引入动力学模型来更有效地捕捉序列中的时间依赖关系

Method: 将输入序列建模为线性随机微分方程的离散观测，利用微分Lyapunov方程的闭式解高效传播成对不确定性，注意力权重对应于传播的成对精度的鲁棒残差重加权

Result: 提出了计算和内存复杂度与标准注意力相同的简化变体，在动力学和过程噪声消失的极限情况下，通过小角度近似可以恢复普通点积注意力

Conclusion: AFA提供了一种将动力学建模融入注意力机制的新框架，在保持计算效率的同时增强了序列建模能力，为标准注意力提供了理论基础和扩展

Abstract: We introduce Adaptive Filter Attention (AFA), a novel attention mechanism
that incorporates a learnable dynamics model directly into the computation of
attention weights. Rather than comparing queries and keys directly, we model
the input sequence as discrete observations of a linear stochastic differential
equation (SDE). By imposing a linear dynamics model with simultaneously
diagonalizable state matrices and noise covariances, we can make use of a
closed-form solution to the differential Lyapunov equation to efficiently
propagate pairwise uncertainties through the dynamics. Attention naturally
arises as the maximum likelihood solution for this linear SDE, with attention
weights corresponding to robust residual-based reweightings of the propagated
pairwise precisions. Imposing an additional constraint on the state matrix's
eigenvalues leads to a simplified variant with the same computational and
memory complexity as standard attention. In the limit of vanishing dynamics and
process noise, and using a small-angle approximation, we recover ordinary
dot-product attention.

Motivation: 虽然成员推理攻击在分类模型中已被广泛研究，但在时间序列预测领域的应用和影响仍未被充分探索，需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 提出了两种新攻击方法：(1)将多变量LiRA攻击从分类模型适配到时间序列预测；(2)新颖的端到端学习方法Deep Time Series (DTS)攻击。在TUH-EEG和ELD数据集上针对LSTM和N-HiTS预测架构进行评估。

Result: 预测模型存在漏洞，用户级攻击通常能达到完美检测。提出的方法在多个设置中表现最强，建立了时间序列预测隐私风险评估的新基准。漏洞随着预测周期增长和训练群体减小而增加。

Conclusion: 时间序列预测模型对成员推理攻击具有脆弱性，需要开发相应的隐私保护措施，特别是在用户级隐私保护和长预测周期的应用场景中。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) aim to determine whether specific data
were used to train a model. While extensively studied on classification models,
their impact on time series forecasting remains largely unexplored. We address
this gap by introducing two new attacks: (i) an adaptation of multivariate
LiRA, a state-of-the-art MIA originally developed for classification models, to
the time-series forecasting setting, and (ii) a novel end-to-end learning
approach called Deep Time Series (DTS) attack. We benchmark these methods
against adapted versions of other leading attacks from the classification
setting.
  We evaluate all attacks in realistic settings on the TUH-EEG and ELD
datasets, targeting two strong forecasting architectures, LSTM and the
state-of-the-art N-HiTS, under both record- and user-level threat models. Our
results show that forecasting models are vulnerable, with user-level attacks
often achieving perfect detection. The proposed methods achieve the strongest
performance in several settings, establishing new baselines for privacy risk
assessment in time series forecasting. Furthermore, vulnerability increases
with longer prediction horizons and smaller training populations, echoing
trends observed in large language models.

Abstract: We comment on Cai and Wang (2020, arXiv:2006.13318), who analyze
over-smoothing in GNNs via Dirichlet energy. We show that under mild spectral
conditions (including with Leaky-ReLU), the Dirichlet energy of node embeddings
decreases exponentially with depth; we further extend the result to spectral
polynomial filters and provide a short proof for the Leaky-ReLU case.
Experiments on edge deletion and weight amplification illustrate when Dirichlet
energy increases, hinting at practical ways to relieve over-smoothing.

TL;DR: Set Block Decoding (SBD) 是一种新的解码范式，通过结合标准下一个令牌预测和掩码令牌预测，实现并行采样多个非连续未来令牌，可将生成所需的前向传递次数减少3-5倍，同时保持与标准方法相同的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归语言模型在推理阶段面临高计算和内存成本的问题，特别是在解码阶段，需要寻找有效的加速方法。

Method: 提出Set Block Decoding (SBD)范式，集成标准下一个令牌预测(NTP)和掩码令牌预测(MATP)，使用离散扩散文献中的高级求解器实现并行采样多个非连续令牌，无需架构更改或额外训练超参数。

Result: 通过对Llama-3.1 8B和Qwen-3 8B进行微调，SBD实现了3-5倍的生成加速，同时保持与等效NTP训练相同的性能表现。

Conclusion: SBD提供了一种简单灵活的生成加速解决方案，在保持兼容性和性能的同时显著减少计算成本。

Abstract: Autoregressive next token prediction language models offer powerful
capabilities but face significant challenges in practical deployment due to the
high computational and memory costs of inference, particularly during the
decoding stage. We introduce Set Block Decoding (SBD), a simple and flexible
paradigm that accelerates generation by integrating standard next token
prediction (NTP) and masked token prediction (MATP) within a single
architecture. SBD allows the model to sample multiple, not necessarily
consecutive, future tokens in parallel, a key distinction from previous
acceleration methods. This flexibility allows the use of advanced solvers from
the discrete diffusion literature, offering significant speedups without
sacrificing accuracy. SBD requires no architectural changes or extra training
hyperparameters, maintains compatibility with exact KV-caching, and can be
implemented by fine-tuning existing next token prediction models. By
fine-tuning Llama-3.1 8B and Qwen-3 8B, we demonstrate that SBD enables a 3-5x
reduction in the number of forward passes required for generation while
achieving same performance as equivalent NTP training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型各有优势，但没有一个模型在所有任务上都表现最优，因此需要利用不同模型的互补能力来提高零样本预测性能。

Method: 提出ZooCast框架，采用One-Embedding-Fits-All范式构建统一表示空间，每个模型用单一嵌入表示，通过相似性匹配为不同预测任务动态选择最优模型。

Result: 在GIFT-Eval零样本预测基准测试中表现出色，保持单模型效率的同时实现性能提升，能够无缝集成新模型并带来渐进式精度提升。

Conclusion: ZooCast有效利用了不同时间序列基础模型的互补优势，通过智能模型选择机制实现了高效且准确的零样本预测，为实际应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The proliferation of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) has significantly
advanced zero-shot forecasting, enabling predictions for unseen time series
without task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive research has confirmed that no
single TSFM excels universally, as different models exhibit preferences for
distinct temporal patterns. This diversity suggests an opportunity: how to take
advantage of the complementary abilities of TSFMs. To this end, we propose
ZooCast, which characterizes each model's distinct forecasting strengths.
ZooCast can intelligently assemble current TSFMs into a model zoo that
dynamically selects optimal models for different forecasting tasks. Our key
innovation lies in the One-Embedding-Fits-All paradigm that constructs a
unified representation space where each model in the zoo is represented by a
single embedding, enabling efficient similarity matching for all tasks.
Experiments demonstrate ZooCast's strong performance on the GIFT-Eval zero-shot
forecasting benchmark while maintaining the efficiency of a single TSFM. In
real-world scenarios with sequential model releases, the framework seamlessly

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的降维质量指标无法解释为什么预期的聚类结构在投影中缺失，而可视化分析方法又因为超参数空间大而耗时。

Method: 利用将降维过程分为关系建模和映射两阶段的框架，引入基于标签的监督指标来量化关系建模阶段与预期聚类结构的一致性。

Abstract: Dimensionality Reduction (DR) is widely used for visualizing high-dimensional
data, often with the goal of revealing expected cluster structure. However,
such a structure may not always appear in the projections. Existing DR quality
metrics assess projection reliability (to some extent) or cluster structure
quality, but do not explain why expected structures are missing. Visual
Analytics solutions can help, but are often time-consuming due to the large
hyperparameter space. This paper addresses this problem by leveraging a recent
framework that divides the DR process into two phases: a relationship phase,
where similarity relationships are modeled, and a mapping phase, where the data
is projected accordingly. We introduce two supervised metrics, precision and
recall, to evaluate the relationship phase. These metrics quantify how well the
modeled relationships align with an expected cluster structure based on some
set of labels representing this structure. We illustrate their application
using t-SNE and UMAP, and validate the approach through various usage
scenarios. Our approach can guide hyperparameter tuning, uncover projection
artifacts, and determine if the expected structure is captured in the
relationships, making the DR process faster and more reliable.

*Cong Ma,Kayvan Najarian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文从理论角度分析状态空间模型(SSM)和Transformer在长程依赖建模能力上的差异，提出了一种结合注意力机制灵活性和SSM计算效率的新隐藏状态更新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有序列模型的长程依赖建模能力缺乏理论分析，阻碍了系统性的改进。需要从数学定义出发比较SSM和Transformer的长程依赖建模能力。

Method: 使用隐藏状态对过去输入的导数来数学定义长程依赖，比较SSM和Transformer的建模能力，并提出新的SSM隐藏状态更新公式。

Result: SSM的长程依赖随序列长度呈指数衰减，与RNN的记忆函数衰减模式一致；而注意力机制不受指数衰减约束，理论上在充足资源下能更好建模长程依赖。

Conclusion: 提出的新SSM隐藏状态更新公式结合了注意力机制的灵活性和SSM的计算效率，并在高斯输入分布下证明了其稳定性。

Abstract: Long-range dependency is one of the most desired properties of recent
sequence models such as state-space models (particularly Mamba) and transformer
models. New model architectures are being actively developed and benchmarked
for prediction tasks requiring long-range dependency. However, the capability
of modeling long-range dependencies of these models has not been investigated
from a theoretical perspective, which hinders a systematic improvement on this
aspect. In this work, we mathematically define long-range dependency using the
derivative of hidden states with respect to past inputs and compare the
capability of SSM and transformer models of modeling long-range dependency
based on this definition. We showed that the long-range dependency of SSM
decays exponentially with the sequence length, which aligns with the
exponential decay of memory function in RNN. But the attention mechanism used
in transformers is more flexible and is not constrained to exponential decay,
which could in theory perform better at modeling long-range dependency with
sufficient training data, computing resources, and proper training. To combine
the flexibility of long-range dependency of attention mechanism and computation
efficiency of SSM, we propose a new formulation for hidden state update in SSM
and prove its stability under a standard Gaussian distribution of the input
data.

Motivation: 现有的层间高斯机制(LGM)方法依赖启发式噪声分配策略，缺乏对噪声分配与隐私-效用权衡之间理论联系的系统理解，导致优化目标不明确和隐私预算使用效率低下。

Method: 提出了一个统一的分析框架，将层间噪声注入策略与其隐含的优化目标和隐私预算分配系统连接起来，并设计了SNR-Consistent噪声分配策略来统一信号保持和隐私预算高效利用。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅为现有方法提供了诊断性见解，还为深度模型中设计自适应和有效的噪声注入方案提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Layer-wise Gaussian mechanisms (LGM) enhance flexibility in differentially
private deep learning by injecting noise into partitioned gradient vectors.
However, existing methods often rely on heuristic noise allocation strategies,
lacking a rigorous understanding of their theoretical grounding in connecting
noise allocation to formal privacy-utility tradeoffs. In this paper, we present
a unified analytical framework that systematically connects layer-wise noise
injection strategies with their implicit optimization objectives and associated
privacy budget allocations. Our analysis reveals that several existing
approaches optimize ill-posed objectives -- either ignoring inter-layer
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) consistency or leading to inefficient use of the
privacy budget. In response, we propose a SNR-Consistent noise allocation
strategy that unifies both aspects, yielding a noise allocation scheme that
achieves better signal preservation and more efficient privacy budget
utilization. Extensive experiments in both centralized and federated learning
settings demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing
allocation strategies, achieving better privacy-utility tradeoffs. Our
framework not only offers diagnostic insights into prior methods but also
provides theoretical guidance for designing adaptive and effective noise
injection schemes in deep models.

Abstract: Background: Heart failure (HF) research is constrained by limited access to
large, shareable datasets due to privacy regulations and institutional
barriers. Synthetic data generation offers a promising solution to overcome
these challenges while preserving patient confidentiality. Methods: We
generated synthetic HF datasets from institutional data comprising 12,552
unique patients using five deep learning models: tabular variational
autoencoder (TVAE), normalizing flow, ADSGAN, SurvivalGAN, and tabular
denoising diffusion probabilistic models (TabDDPM). We comprehensively
evaluated synthetic data utility through statistical similarity metrics,
survival prediction using machine learning and privacy assessments. Results:
SurvivalGAN and TabDDPM demonstrated high fidelity to the original dataset,
exhibiting similar variable distributions and survival curves after applying
histogram equalization. SurvivalGAN (C-indices: 0.71-0.76) and TVAE (C-indices:
0.73-0.76) achieved the strongest performance in survival prediction
evaluation, closely matched real data performance (C-indices: 0.73-0.76).
Privacy evaluation confirmed protection against re-identification attacks.
Conclusions: Deep learning-based synthetic data generation can produce
high-fidelity, privacy-preserving HF datasets suitable for research
applications. This publicly available synthetic dataset addresses critical data
sharing barriers and provides a valuable resource for advancing HF research and
predictive modeling.

Motivation: 比较强化学习(RL)和监督微调(SFT)在微调模型时的效果差异，特别关注它们对模型先验知识和能力的保持情况

Method: 通过理论分析和实验验证，使用KL散度衡量分布偏移程度，在大型语言模型和机器人基础模型上进行实验

Result: RL微调在保持先验知识方面显著优于SFT，KL散度是决定遗忘程度的关键因素，RL倾向于选择KL最小的解决方案

Conclusion: 提出了"RL剃刀"原则：在解决新任务的所有方法中，RL偏好与原始模型KL距离最小的解决方案

Abstract: Comparison of fine-tuning models with reinforcement learning (RL) and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) reveals that, despite similar performance at a new
task, RL preserves prior knowledge and capabilities significantly better. We
find that the degree of forgetting is determined by the distributional shift,
measured as the KL-divergence between the fine-tuned and base policy evaluated
on the new task. Our analysis reveals that on-policy RL is implicitly biased
towards KL-minimal solutions among the many that solve the new task, whereas
SFT can converge to distributions arbitrarily far from the base model. We
validate these findings through experiments with large language models and
robotic foundation models and further provide theoretical justification for why
on-policy RL updates lead to a smaller KL change. We term this principle
$\textit{RL's Razor}$: among all ways to solve a new task, RL prefers those
closest in KL to the original model.

Result: 在差分隐私逻辑回归和深度迁移学习的实验中，该方法以显著更少的计算成本和用户交互收敛到最优隐私-准确性权衡

Conclusion: 该方法通过利用问题结构和改进交互方式，为差分隐私权衡优化提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is the standard for privacy-preserving analysis,
and introduces a fundamental trade-off between privacy guarantees and model
performance. Selecting the optimal balance is a critical challenge that can be
framed as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem where one first
discovers the set of optimal trade-offs (the Pareto front) and then learns a
decision-maker's preference over them. While a rich body of work on interactive
MOO exists, the standard approach -- modeling the objective functions with
generic surrogates and learning preferences from simple pairwise feedback -- is
inefficient for DP because it fails to leverage the problem's unique structure:
a point on the Pareto front can be generated directly by maximizing accuracy
for a fixed privacy level. Motivated by this property, we first derive the
shape of the trade-off theoretically, which allows us to model the Pareto front
directly and efficiently. To address inefficiency in preference learning, we
replace pairwise comparisons with a more informative interaction. In
particular, we present the user with hypothetical trade-off curves and ask them
to pick their preferred trade-off. Our experiments on differentially private
logistic regression and deep transfer learning across six real-world datasets
show that our method converges to the optimal privacy-accuracy trade-off with
significantly less computational cost and user interaction than baselines.

still, they fail in high-stakes situations and across socially sensitive lines.
These issues have a chilling effect on the adoption of machine learning methods

image analysis. We highlight two previously overlooked problems, which we call
the \textit{no fair lunch} problem and the \textit{subgroup separability}
problem. We elucidate why today's fair representation learning methods fail to
adequately solve them and propose potential paths forward for the field.

Abstract: Although real-world decision-making problems can often be encoded as causal
multi-armed bandits (CMABs) at different levels of abstraction, a general
methodology exploiting the information and computational advantages of each
abstraction level is missing. In this paper, we propose AT-UCB, an algorithm
which efficiently exploits shared information between CMAB problem instances
defined at different levels of abstraction. More specifically, AT-UCB leverages
causal abstraction (CA) theory to explore within a cheap-to-simulate and
coarse-grained CMAB instance, before employing the traditional upper confidence
bound (UCB) algorithm on a restricted set of potentially optimal actions in the
CMAB of interest, leading to significant reductions in cumulative regret when
compared to the classical UCB algorithm. We illustrate the advantages of AT-UCB
theoretically, through a novel upper bound on the cumulative regret, and
empirically, by applying AT-UCB to epidemiological simulators with varying
resolution and computational cost.

Abstract: Due to the threat of changing climate and extreme weather events, the
infrastructure of the United States Army installations is at risk. More than
ever, climate resilience measures are needed to protect facility assets that
support critical missions and help generate readiness. As most of the Army
installations within the continental United States rely on commercial energy
and water sources, resilience to the vulnerabilities within independent energy
resources (electricity grids, natural gas pipelines, etc) along with a baseline
understanding of energy usage within installations must be determined. This
paper will propose a data-driven behavioral model to determine behavior
profiles of energy usage on installations. These profiles will be used 1) to
create a baseline assessment of the impact of unexpected disruptions on energy
systems and 2) to benchmark future resiliency measures. In this methodology,
individual building behavior will be represented with models that can
accurately analyze, predict, and cluster multimodal data collected from energy
usage of non-residential buildings. Due to the nature of Army installation
energy usage data, similarly structured open access data will be used to
illustrate this methodology.

Motivation: 私家车快速增长加剧城市停车难题，现有方法在建模时空依赖性和利用多源数据方面存在局限，需要更准确的停车可用性预测来支持城市规划管理

Method: 使用K-means聚类建立停车集群区域(PCZs)，整合地铁、公交、网约车、出租车等多源交通数据需求特征。在iTransformer基础上改进，集成掩码重构自监督预训练任务，采用双分支注意力机制：序列注意力捕捉长期时间依赖，通道注意力建模跨变量交互

Result: 在成都真实数据上的实验表明，SST-iTransformer优于包括Informer、Autoformer、Crossformer和iTransformer在内的基线深度学习模型，实现了最低的均方误差(MSE)和具有竞争力的平均绝对误差(MAE)，达到最先进性能

Conclusion: 消融研究显示网约车数据贡献最大，其次是出租车数据，固定路线交通特征(公交/地铁)贡献较小。空间相关性分析证实排除PCZs内相关停车位历史数据会导致性能显著下降，强调了建模空间依赖性的重要性

Abstract: The rapid growth of private car ownership has worsened the urban parking
predicament, underscoring the need for accurate and effective parking
availability prediction to support urban planning and management. To address
key limitations in modeling spatio-temporal dependencies and exploiting
multi-source data for parking availability prediction, this study proposes a
novel approach with SST-iTransformer. The methodology leverages K-means
clustering to establish parking cluster zones (PCZs), extracting and
integrating traffic demand characteristics from various transportation modes
(i.e., metro, bus, online ride-hailing, and taxi) associated with the targeted
parking lots. Upgraded on vanilla iTransformer, SST-iTransformer integrates
masking-reconstruction-based pretext tasks for self-supervised spatio-temporal
representation learning, and features an innovative dual-branch attention
mechanism: Series Attention captures long-term temporal dependencies via
patching operations, while Channel Attention models cross-variate interactions
through inverted dimensions. Extensive experiments using real-world data from
Chengdu, China, demonstrate that SST-iTransformer outperforms baseline deep
learning models (including Informer, Autoformer, Crossformer, and
iTransformer), achieving state-of-the-art performance with the lowest mean
squared error (MSE) and competitive mean absolute error (MAE). Comprehensive
ablation studies quantitatively reveal the relative importance of different
data sources: incorporating ride-hailing data provides the largest performance
gains, followed by taxi, whereas fixed-route transit features (bus/metro)
contribute marginally. Spatial correlation analysis further confirms that
excluding historical data from correlated parking lots within PCZs leads to
substantial performance degradation, underscoring the importance of modeling
spatial dependencies.

Conclusion: 通过偏差-协方差关系的新方法能够有效利用历史数据，在批处主动学习中实现更优的性能表现，为异方差性偶发不确定性环境下的实验设计提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Real-world experimental scenarios are characterized by the presence of
heteroskedastic aleatoric uncertainty, and this uncertainty can be correlated
in batched settings. The bias--variance tradeoff can be used to write the
expected mean squared error between a model distribution and a ground-truth
random variable as the sum of an epistemic uncertainty term, the bias squared,
and an aleatoric uncertainty term. We leverage this relationship to propose
novel active learning strategies that directly reduce the bias between
experimental rounds, considering model systems both with and without noise.
Finally, we investigate methods to leverage historical data in a quadratic
manner through the use of a novel cobias--covariance relationship, which
naturally proposes a mechanism for batching through an eigendecomposition
strategy. When our difference-based method leveraging the cobias--covariance
relationship is utilized in a batched setting (with a quadratic estimator), we
outperform a number of canonical methods including BALD and Least Confidence.

Motivation: 随着序列长度增加，KV缓存成为主要内存瓶颈，需要更高效的内存管理策略来解决这个问题。

Conclusion: PagedEviction有效解决了KV缓存的内存瓶颈问题，为长上下文LLM推理提供了更高效的内存管理方案。

Abstract: KV caching significantly improves the efficiency of Large Language Model
(LLM) inference by storing attention states from previously processed tokens,
enabling faster generation of subsequent tokens. However, as sequence length
increases, the KV cache quickly becomes a major memory bottleneck. To address
this, we propose PagedEviction, a novel fine-grained, structured KV cache
pruning strategy that enhances the memory efficiency of vLLM's PagedAttention.
Unlike existing approaches that rely on attention-based token importance or
evict tokens across different vLLM pages, PagedEviction introduces an efficient
block-wise eviction algorithm tailored for paged memory layouts. Our method
integrates seamlessly with PagedAttention without requiring any modifications
to its CUDA attention kernels. We evaluate PagedEviction across
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, and Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct models
on the LongBench benchmark suite, demonstrating improved memory usage with
better accuracy than baselines on long context tasks.

TL;DR: TiM模型通过引入精确的连续时间动力学方程，解决了生成模型中迭代扩散模型计算成本高与少步生成模型质量上限的冲突，实现了任意步数的状态转换，在保持高效的同时获得最先进的生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生成模型中的基本困境：迭代扩散模型计算成本高，而高效少步替代方案存在质量上限限制。这种冲突源于训练目标要么专注于无限小动力学，要么专注于直接端点预测。

Method: 引入精确的连续时间动力学方程，解析定义任意有限时间间隔内的状态转换。提出Transition Models (TiM)生成范式，适应任意步数转换，从单步跳跃到多步精细化都能无缝处理。

Result: 仅用865M参数就实现了最先进性能，超越SD3.5(8B参数)和FLUX.1(12B参数)等领先模型。随着采样预算增加，TiM展现出单调质量提升。在原生分辨率策略下，可在4096x4096分辨率下提供卓越保真度。

Conclusion: TiM通过创新的连续时间动力学方法，成功解决了生成模型中步数与质量的权衡问题，为高效高质量生成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: A fundamental dilemma in generative modeling persists: iterative diffusion
models achieve outstanding fidelity, but at a significant computational cost,
while efficient few-step alternatives are constrained by a hard quality
ceiling. This conflict between generation steps and output quality arises from
restrictive training objectives that focus exclusively on either infinitesimal
dynamics (PF-ODEs) or direct endpoint prediction. We address this challenge by
introducing an exact, continuous-time dynamics equation that analytically
defines state transitions across any finite time interval. This leads to a
novel generative paradigm, Transition Models (TiM), which adapt to
arbitrary-step transitions, seamlessly traversing the generative trajectory
from single leaps to fine-grained refinement with more steps. Despite having
only 865M parameters, TiM achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing
leading models such as SD3.5 (8B parameters) and FLUX.1 (12B parameters) across
all evaluated step counts. Importantly, unlike previous few-step generators,
TiM demonstrates monotonic quality improvement as the sampling budget
increases. Additionally, when employing our native-resolution strategy, TiM
delivers exceptional fidelity at resolutions up to 4096x4096.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA的下投影是随机初始化和数据无关的，丢弃了潜在有用信息，而分析显示该投影在训练中变化很小，成为性能瓶颈。

Method: 提出IPA框架，在线性情况下使用近似主成分分析的算法实例化，实现高效投影器预训练且推理开销可忽略。

Result: 在常识推理任务上平均准确率提高1.5个百分点，VTAB-1k上提高2.3个百分点，冻结投影时仅用一半可训练参数即可达到完整LoRA性能。

Conclusion: IPA通过特征感知投影有效解决了LoRA的信息丢失问题，在参数效率和性能方面都有显著提升。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, reduce
adaptation cost by injecting low-rank updates into pretrained weights. However,
LoRA's down-projection is randomly initialized and data-agnostic, discarding
potentially useful information. Prior analyses show that this projection
changes little during training, while the up-projection carries most of the
adaptation, making the random input compression a performance bottleneck. We
propose IPA, a feature-aware projection framework that explicitly preserves
information in the reduced hidden space. In the linear case, we instantiate IPA
with algorithms approximating top principal components, enabling efficient
projector pretraining with negligible inference overhead. Across language and
vision benchmarks, IPA consistently improves over LoRA and DoRA, achieving on
average 1.5 points higher accuracy on commonsense reasoning and 2.3 points on
VTAB-1k, while matching full LoRA performance with roughly half the trainable
parameters when the projection is frozen.

Motivation: 现有方法缺乏因果意识，对异质性、混杂因素和观测约束的建模不足，导致可解释性差且难以区分真正的因果异质性与虚假关联。

Method: HCL通过引入等效表示来编码结构异质性和混杂因素，放松了同质性和充分性假设。采用双向迭代策略交替优化因果聚类和结构学习，并结合自监督正则化平衡跨聚类的普遍性和特异性。

Result: 理论上证明了在温和条件下异质因果结构的可识别性。实证表明HCL在聚类和结构学习任务中表现优异，并在真实单细胞扰动数据中恢复了具有生物学意义的机制。

Conclusion: HCL能够发现可解释的、机制级别的因果异质性，在科学发现领域具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Understanding causal heterogeneity is essential for scientific discovery in
domains such as biology and medicine. However, existing methods lack causal
awareness, with insufficient modeling of heterogeneity, confounding, and
observational constraints, leading to poor interpretability and difficulty
distinguishing true causal heterogeneity from spurious associations. We propose
an unsupervised framework, HCL (Interpretable Causal Mechanism-Aware Clustering
with Adaptive Heterogeneous Causal Structure Learning), that jointly infers
latent clusters and their associated causal structures from mixed-type
observational data without requiring temporal ordering, environment labels,
interventions or other prior knowledge. HCL relaxes the homogeneity and
sufficiency assumptions by introducing an equivalent representation that
encodes both structural heterogeneity and confounding. It further develops a
bi-directional iterative strategy to alternately refine causal clustering and
structure learning, along with a self-supervised regularization that balance
cross-cluster universality and specificity. Together, these components enable
convergence toward interpretable, heterogeneous causal patterns. Theoretically,
we show identifiability of heterogeneous causal structures under mild
conditions. Empirically, HCL achieves superior performance in both clustering
and structure learning tasks, and recovers biologically meaningful mechanisms
in real-world single-cell perturbation data, demonstrating its utility for
discovering interpretable, mechanism-level causal heterogeneity.

TL;DR: 本文提出了统一策略梯度估计器，将强化学习和监督微调统一为单一优化过程，并提出了混合后训练算法HPT，在数学推理任务上表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语言模型后训练主要使用在线数据（模型生成）和离线数据（人类演示），分别对应RL和SFT方法。本文旨在证明这两种方法并非对立，而是同一优化过程的不同实例

Method: 推导出统一策略梯度估计器，将各种后训练方法表示为不同数据分布假设下的梯度计算。提出混合后训练算法HPT，动态选择不同训练信号

Result: 在六个数学推理基准和两个分布外测试集上，HPT在不同规模和系列的模型上都持续超越强基线

Conclusion: 理论框架统一了RL和SFT方法，HPT算法能够有效利用演示数据并保持稳定探索，不牺牲已学习的推理模式

Abstract: Two major sources of training data exist for post-training modern language
models: online (model-generated rollouts) data, and offline (human or
other-model demonstrations) data. These two types of data are typically used by
approaches like Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
respectively. In this paper, we show that these approaches are not in
contradiction, but are instances of a single optimization process. We derive a
Unified Policy Gradient Estimator, and present the calculations of a wide
spectrum of post-training approaches as the gradient of a common objective
under different data distribution assumptions and various bias-variance
tradeoffs. The gradient estimator is constructed with four interchangeable
parts: stabilization mask, reference policy denominator, advantage estimate,
and likelihood gradient. Motivated by our theoretical findings, we propose
Hybrid Post-Training (HPT), an algorithm that dynamically selects different
training signals. HPT is designed to yield both effective exploitation of
demonstration and stable exploration without sacrificing learned reasoning
patterns. We provide extensive experiments and ablation studies to verify the
effectiveness of our unified theoretical framework and HPT. Across six
mathematical reasoning benchmarks and two out-of-distribution suites, HPT
consistently surpasses strong baselines across models of varying scales and
families.

<details>

Motivation: 传统ESN的设计和动力学分析主要基于启发式方法，缺乏系统理论指导，需要从第一性原理出发建立统一的理论框架

Method: 1) 将ESN重构为状态空间模型；2) 推导输入到状态稳定性的可验证条件；3) 开发小信号线性化和Koopman特征扩展两种映射方法；4) 提出基于卡尔曼滤波/EKF的读出学习算法和EM超参数优化

Conclusion: 状态空间模型框架为ESN提供了系统理论基础，使得网络设计、稳定性分析和性能优化更加严谨和可解释

Abstract: Echo State Networks (ESNs) are typically presented as efficient,
readout-trained recurrent models, yet their dynamics and design are often
guided by heuristics rather than first principles. We recast ESNs explicitly as
state-space models (SSMs), providing a unified systems-theoretic account that
links reservoir computing with classical identification and modern kernelized
SSMs. First, we show that the echo-state property is an instance of
input-to-state stability for a contractive nonlinear SSM and derive verifiable
conditions in terms of leak, spectral scaling, and activation Lipschitz
constants. Second, we develop two complementary mappings: (i) small-signal
linearizations that yield locally valid LTI SSMs with interpretable poles and
memory horizons; and (ii) lifted/Koopman random-feature expansions that render
the ESN a linear SSM in an augmented state, enabling transfer-function and
convolutional-kernel analyses. This perspective yields frequency-domain
characterizations of memory spectra and clarifies when ESNs emulate structured
SSM kernels. Third, we cast teacher forcing as state estimation and propose
Kalman/EKF-assisted readout learning, together with EM for hyperparameters
(leak, spectral radius, process/measurement noise) and a hybrid subspace
procedure for spectral shaping under contraction constraints.

Abstract: Recent advancements in tabular deep learning have demonstrated exceptional
practical performance, yet the field often lacks a clear understanding of why
these techniques actually succeed. To address this gap, our paper highlights
the importance of the concept of data uncertainty for explaining the
effectiveness of the recent tabular DL methods. In particular, we reveal that
the success of many beneficial design choices in tabular DL, such as numerical
feature embeddings, retrieval-augmented models and advanced ensembling
strategies, can be largely attributed to their implicit mechanisms for managing
high data uncertainty. By dissecting these mechanisms, we provide a unifying
understanding of the recent performance improvements. Furthermore, the insights
derived from this data-uncertainty perspective directly allowed us to develop
more effective numerical feature embeddings as an immediate practical outcome
of our analysis. Overall, our work paves the way to foundational understanding
of the benefits introduced by modern tabular methods that results in the
concrete advancements of existing techniques and outlines future research
directions for tabular DL.

Method: 提出Delta Activations方法，通过计算微调模型与基础模型内部激活的差异来生成向量表示，支持模型聚类、任务嵌入和模型选择。

Abstract: The success of powerful open source Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled
the community to create a vast collection of post-trained models adapted to
specific tasks and domains. However, navigating and understanding these models
remains challenging due to inconsistent metadata and unstructured repositories.
We introduce Delta Activations, a method to represent finetuned models as
vector embeddings by measuring shifts in their internal activations relative to
a base model. This representation allows for effective clustering by domain and
task, revealing structure in the model landscape. Delta Activations also
demonstrate desirable properties: it is robust across finetuning settings and
exhibits an additive property when finetuning datasets are mixed. In addition,
we show that Delta Activations can embed tasks via few-shot finetuning, and
further explore its use for model selection and merging. We hope Delta
Activations can facilitate the practice of reusing publicly available models.

Motivation: 当前AI对齐人类偏好时使用的标准偏好获取方法往往无法捕捉人类决策的真实认知过程（如启发式简化），导致学习到的模型与人类认知过程不一致，无法推广到其他决策任务。

Method: 采用公理化方法，基于特征处理和比较的认知过程建模，首先处理并比较各替代方案的特征，然后通过固定规则（如Bradley-Terry规则）聚合处理后的特征。

Conclusion: 该方法能够学习到更符合人类真实认知过程的决策模型，为AI对齐提供了更可靠的认知基础，具有更好的解释性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent AI work trends towards incorporating human-centric objectives, with
the explicit goal of aligning AI models to personal preferences and societal
values. Using standard preference elicitation methods, researchers and
practitioners build models of human decisions and judgments, which are then
used to align AI behavior with that of humans. However, models commonly used in
such elicitation processes often do not capture the true cognitive processes of
human decision making, such as when people use heuristics to simplify
information associated with a decision problem. As a result, models learned
from people's decisions often do not align with their cognitive processes, and
can not be used to validate the learning framework for generalization to other
decision-making tasks. To address this limitation, we take an axiomatic
approach to learning cognitively faithful decision processes from pairwise
comparisons. Building on the vast literature characterizing the cognitive
processes that contribute to human decision-making, and recent work
characterizing such processes in pairwise comparison tasks, we define a class
of models in which individual features are first processed and compared across
alternatives, and then the processed features are then aggregated via a fixed
rule, such as the Bradley-Terry rule. This structured processing of information
ensures such models are realistic and feasible candidates to represent
underlying human decision-making processes. We demonstrate the efficacy of this
modeling approach in learning interpretable models of human decision making in
a kidney allocation task, and show that our proposed models match or surpass
the accuracy of prior models of human pairwise decision-making.

Abstract: We present ChronoGraph, a graph-structured multivariate time series
forecasting dataset built from real-world production microservices. Each node
is a service that emits a multivariate stream of system-level performance
metrics, capturing CPU, memory, and network usage patterns, while directed
edges encode dependencies between services. The primary task is forecasting
future values of these signals at the service level. In addition, ChronoGraph
provides expert-annotated incident windows as anomaly labels, enabling
evaluation of anomaly detection methods and assessment of forecast robustness
during operational disruptions. Compared to existing benchmarks from industrial
control systems or traffic and air-quality domains, ChronoGraph uniquely
combines (i) multivariate time series, (ii) an explicit, machine-readable
dependency graph, and (iii) anomaly labels aligned with real incidents. We
report baseline results spanning forecasting models, pretrained time-series
foundation models, and standard anomaly detectors. ChronoGraph offers a
realistic benchmark for studying structure-aware forecasting and incident-aware
evaluation in microservice systems.

Conclusion: 该方法将群体智能与机械稳定性原理相结合，为异构空中系统在通信受限环境中处理复杂运输任务提供了可扩展框架。

Abstract: In comparison with existing approaches, which struggle with scalability,
communication dependency, and robustness against dynamic failures, cooperative
aerial transportation via robot swarms holds transformative potential for
logistics and disaster response. Here, we present a physics-inspired
cooperative transportation approach for flying robot swarms that imitates the
dissipative mechanics of table-leg load distribution. By developing a
decentralized dissipative force model, our approach enables autonomous
formation stabilization and adaptive load allocation without the requirement of
explicit communication. Based on local neighbor robots and the suspended
payload, each robot dynamically adjusts its position. This is similar to
energy-dissipating table leg reactions. The stability of the resultant control
system is rigorously proved. Simulations demonstrate that the tracking errors
of the proposed approach are 20%, 68%, 55.5%, and 21.9% of existing approaches
under the cases of capability variation, cable uncertainty, limited vision, and
payload variation, respectively. In real-world experiments with six flying
robots, the cooperative aerial transportation system achieved a 94% success
rate under single-robot failure, disconnection events, 25% payload variation,
and 40% cable length uncertainty, demonstrating strong robustness under outdoor
winds up to Beaufort scale 4. Overall, this physics-inspired approach bridges
swarm intelligence and mechanical stability principles, offering a scalable
framework for heterogeneous aerial systems to collectively handle complex
transportation tasks in communication-constrained environments.

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种有效的方法来解决双机器人协同抓取运输问题，具有良好的通用性和实际应用价值

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for decision-making in cooperative grasping for
two-robot object transport in constrained environments. The core of the
framework is a Conditional Embedding (CE) model consisting of two neural
networks that map grasp configuration information into an embedding space. The
resulting embedding vectors are then used to identify feasible grasp
configurations that allow two robots to collaboratively transport an object. To
ensure generalizability across diverse environments and object geometries, the
neural networks are trained on a dataset comprising a range of environment maps
and object shapes. We employ a supervised learning approach with negative
sampling to ensure that the learned embeddings effectively distinguish between
feasible and infeasible grasp configurations. Evaluation results across a wide
range of environments and objects in simulations demonstrate the model's
ability to reliably identify feasible grasp configurations. We further validate
the framework through experiments on a physical robotic platform, confirming
its practical applicability.

Abstract: The ability to generate a diverse and plausible distribution of future
trajectories is a critical capability for autonomous vehicle planning systems.
While recent generative models have shown promise, achieving high fidelity,
computational efficiency, and precise control remains a significant challenge.
In this paper, we present the \textbf{Efficient Virtuoso}, a conditional latent
diffusion model for goal-conditioned trajectory planning. Our approach
introduces a novel two-stage normalization pipeline that first scales
trajectories to preserve their geometric aspect ratio and then normalizes the
resulting PCA latent space to ensure a stable training target. The denoising
process is performed efficiently in this low-dimensional latent space by a
simple MLP denoiser, which is conditioned on a rich scene context fused by a
powerful Transformer-based StateEncoder. We demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset,
reaching a \textbf{minADE of 0.25}. Furthermore, through a rigorous ablation
study on goal representation, we provide a key insight: while a single endpoint
goal can resolve strategic ambiguity, a richer, multi-step sparse route is
essential for enabling the precise, high-fidelity tactical execution that
mirrors nuanced human driving behavior.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into robotic systems has
accelerated progress in embodied artificial intelligence, yet current
approaches remain constrained by existing robotic architectures, particularly
serial mechanisms. This hardware dependency fundamentally limits the scope of
robotic intelligence. Here, we present INGRID (Intelligent Generative Robotic
Design), a framework that enables the automated design of parallel robotic
mechanisms through deep integration with reciprocal screw theory and kinematic
synthesis methods. We decompose the design challenge into four progressive
tasks: constraint analysis, kinematic joint generation, chain construction, and
complete mechanism design. INGRID demonstrates the ability to generate novel
parallel mechanisms with both fixed and variable mobility, discovering
kinematic configurations not previously documented in the literature. We
validate our approach through three case studies demonstrating how INGRID
assists users in designing task-specific parallel robots based on desired
mobility requirements. By bridging the gap between mechanism theory and machine
learning, INGRID enables researchers without specialized robotics training to
create custom parallel mechanisms, thereby decoupling advances in robotic
intelligence from hardware constraints. This work establishes a foundation for
mechanism intelligence, where AI systems actively design robotic hardware,
potentially transforming the development of embodied AI systems.

Abstract: Quadruped-based mobile manipulation presents significant challenges in
robotics due to the diversity of required skills, the extended task horizon,

transport, and drop into actions, with emerged behaviors such as re-grasping
and task chaining. We conduct an extensive set of real-world experiments with

Abstract: Manipulating clothing is challenging due to complex configurations, variable
material dynamics, and frequent self-occlusion. Prior systems often flatten
garments or assume visibility of key features. We present a dual-arm
visuotactile framework that combines confidence-aware dense visual
correspondence and tactile-supervised grasp affordance to operate directly on
crumpled and suspended garments. The correspondence model is trained on a
custom, high-fidelity simulated dataset using a distributional loss that
captures cloth symmetries and generates correspondence confidence estimates.
These estimates guide a reactive state machine that adapts folding strategies
based on perceptual uncertainty. In parallel, a visuotactile grasp affordance
network, self-supervised using high-resolution tactile feedback, determines
which regions are physically graspable. The same tactile classifier is used
during execution for real-time grasp validation. By deferring action in
low-confidence states, the system handles highly occluded table-top and in-air
configurations. We demonstrate our task-agnostic grasp selection module in
folding and hanging tasks. Moreover, our dense descriptors provide a reusable
intermediate representation for other planning modalities, such as extracting
grasp targets from human video demonstrations, paving the way for more
generalizable and scalable garment manipulation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出基于多模态测量融合的4WIS4WID爬墙机器人位姿估计器，使用EKF和UKF融合轮式里程计、视觉里程计和IMU数据，解决了建筑环境中传统定位传感器不可用的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 爬墙机器人在建筑环境中需要精确定位来携带测量设备和维护工具，但由于建筑立面的复杂几何和材料特性，传统定位传感器（激光、超声波、雷达）不可行，GPS也因信号衰减不可靠，因此需要开发基于里程计融合的位姿估计方案。

Method: 使用扩展卡尔曼滤波(EKF)和无迹卡尔曼滤波(UKF)融合轮式里程计、视觉里程计和IMU数据；采用非线性优化和Levenberg-Marquardt方法进行系统参数标定，使用遗传算法和粒子群算法进行运动学参数标定。

Result: 通过实验在爬墙机器人平台上详细验证了标定方法和位姿估计器的性能，结果表明该方法能够有效解决传统定位传感器在建筑环境中的限制问题。

Conclusion: 提出的多模态测量融合位姿估计方法为爬墙机器人在复杂建筑环境中的精确定位提供了有效解决方案，克服了传统定位技术的局限性。

Abstract: This paper presents the design of a pose estimator for a four wheel
independent steer four wheel independent drive (4WIS4WID) wall climbing mobile
robot, based on the fusion of multimodal measurements, including wheel
odometry, visual odometry, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) data using
Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). The pose
estimator is a critical component of wall climbing mobile robots, as their
operational environment involves carrying precise measurement equipment and
maintenance tools in construction, requiring information about pose on the
building at the time of measurement. Due to the complex geometry and material
properties of building facades, the use of traditional localization sensors
such as laser, ultrasonic, or radar is often infeasible for wall-climbing
robots. Moreover, GPS-based localization is generally unreliable in these
environments because of signal degradation caused by reinforced concrete and
electromagnetic interference. Consequently, robot odometry remains the primary
source of velocity and position information, despite being susceptible to drift
caused by both systematic and non-systematic errors. The calibrations of the
robot's systematic parameters were conducted using nonlinear optimization and
Levenberg-Marquardt methods as Newton-Gauss and gradient-based model fitting
methods, while Genetic algorithm and Particle swarm were used as
stochastic-based methods for kinematic parameter calibration. Performance and
results of the calibration methods and pose estimators were validated in detail
with experiments on the experimental mobile wall climbing robot.

TL;DR: FPC-VLA是一个双模型框架，将视觉-语言-动作模型与故障预测和纠正监督器集成，通过视觉语言查询评估动作可行性并生成纠正策略，在多个仿真平台和机器人实体上优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统感知-规划流水线在开放任务中灵活性不足，而单一端到端VLA模型缺乏故障预测和恢复机制，需要更可靠的自主系统架构。

Method: 提出FPC-VLA双模型框架：VLA模型负责动作生成，监督器通过视觉语言查询评估动作可行性并生成纠正策略，使用相似性引导融合模块优化动作，仅在关键帧激活监督器以减少时间开销。

Conclusion: FPC-VLA通过集成故障预测和纠正机制，展示了强大的泛化能力和实际效用，为构建更可靠的自主系统提供了有效解决方案，并在真实世界的长视野任务中成功部署。

Abstract: Robotic manipulation is a fundamental component of automation. However,
traditional perception-planning pipelines often fall short in open-ended tasks
due to limited flexibility, while the architecture of a single end-to-end
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) offers promising capabilities but lacks crucial
mechanisms for anticipating and recovering from failure. To address these
challenges, we propose FPC-VLA, a dual-model framework that integrates VLA with
a supervisor for failure prediction and correction. The supervisor evaluates
action viability through vision-language queries and generates corrective
strategies when risks arise, trained efficiently without manual labeling. A
similarity-guided fusion module further refines actions by leveraging past
predictions. Evaluation results on multiple simulation platforms (SIMPLER and
LIBERO) and robot embodiments (WidowX, Google Robot, Franka) show that FPC-VLA
outperforms state-of-the-art models in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings.
By activating the supervisor only at keyframes, our approach significantly
increases task success rates with minimal impact on execution time. Successful
real-world deployments on diverse, long-horizon tasks confirm FPC-VLA's strong
generalization and practical utility for building more reliable autonomous
systems.

Abstract: While current onboard state estimation methods are adequate for most driving

interaction between tires and road surfaces. This paper explores a novel

frequencies between 1 Hz and 32 000 Hz to demonstrate the efficacy of our
communication concept. The implemented prototype sensor showcases minimal data
loss, approximately 0.1 % of the sampled data, validating the reliability of
our developed communication system. This work contributes to advancing
real-time data acquisition, providing insights into optimizing integrated wheel

Motivation: 现有基于流匹配的VLA模型在复杂下游任务中动作精度不足，仅依赖模仿学习的后训练范式难以深入理解数据质量分布特性，而强化学习在这方面具有优势

Method: 理论提出VLA流模型的离线RL后训练目标，推导出ARFM算法。在VLA流模型损失中引入自适应调整的缩放因子，构建有原则的偏差-方差权衡目标函数

Result: ARFM在仿真和真实世界实验中表现出优秀的泛化性、鲁棒性、少样本学习和持续学习性能

Conclusion: ARFM通过自适应平衡RL优势保持和流损失梯度方差控制，实现了更稳定高效的VLA模型微调过程

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models based on flow matching have shown
excellent performance in general-purpose robotic manipulation tasks. However,
the action accuracy of these models on complex downstream tasks is
unsatisfactory. One important reason is that these models rely solely on the
post-training paradigm of imitation learning, which makes it difficult to have
a deeper understanding of the distribution properties of data quality, which is
exactly what Reinforcement Learning (RL) excels at. In this paper, we
theoretically propose an offline RL post-training objective for VLA flow models
and induce an efficient and feasible offline RL fine-tuning algorithm --
Adaptive Reinforced Flow Matching (ARFM). By introducing an adaptively adjusted
scaling factor in the VLA flow model loss, we construct a principled
bias-variance trade-off objective function to optimally control the impact of
RL signal on flow loss. ARFM adaptively balances RL advantage preservation and
flow loss gradient variance control, resulting in a more stable and efficient
fine-tuning process. Extensive simulation and real-world experimental results
show that ARFM exhibits excellent generalization, robustness, few-shot
learning, and continuous learning performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统深度强化学习在机器人任务中存在的进行错误导致探索效率低下、容易收敛到次优策略的问题。

Method: 基于IBRL算法，改进动作选择模块提供检定的Q值，使用SAC代替TD3作为RL策略，并融合示范数据。

Result: 在桶装载和扑克拉屏任务中验证了方法的有效性，在不同状态-动作维度和示范质量下都表现稳定，实际部署获得成功。

Conclusion: DRLR框架能够有效减少进行错误、提高探索效率、防止过拟合，并在实际工业机器人任务中实现了成功的模拟到实际的迁移。

Abstract: This paper proposes an exploration-efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning with
Reference policy (DRLR) framework for learning robotics tasks that incorporates
demonstrations. The DRLR framework is developed based on an algorithm called
Imitation Bootstrapped Reinforcement Learning (IBRL). We propose to improve
IBRL by modifying the action selection module. The proposed action selection
module provides a calibrated Q-value, which mitigates the bootstrapping error
that otherwise leads to inefficient exploration. Furthermore, to prevent the RL
policy from converging to a sub-optimal policy, SAC is used as the RL policy
instead of TD3. The effectiveness of our method in mitigating bootstrapping
error and preventing overfitting is empirically validated by learning two
robotics tasks: bucket loading and open drawer, which require extensive
interactions with the environment. Simulation results also demonstrate the
robustness of the DRLR framework across tasks with both low and high
state-action dimensions, and varying demonstration qualities. To evaluate the
developed framework on a real-world industrial robotics task, the bucket
loading task is deployed on a real wheel loader. The sim2real results validate
the successful deployment of the DRLR framework.

Motivation: 传统数值规划方法虽能解决一般运动规划问题，但运行时间要求高，需要快速的替代方案。

Method: 使用激流模型，从数值规划器生成的数据集中学习，初始模型使用点云嵌入作为输入预测关键点基于的关节序列输出。

Result: 模型在不使用点云编码的情况下仍超过数值模型一个数量级的运行速度，在测试集上达到90%的无碰撞解决成功率。

Conclusion: 深度学习基于激流模型的方法可以在保持高成功率的同时大幅提升机器人运动规划的效率。

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based action model for robotic motion planning.
Commonly, established numerical planning approaches are used to solve general
motion planning problems, but have significant runtime requirements. By
leveraging the power of deep learning, we are able to achieve good results in a
much smaller runtime by learning from a dataset generated by these planners.
While our initial model uses point cloud embeddings in the input to predict
keypoint-based joint sequences in its output, we observed in our ablation study
that it remained challenging to condition the network on the point cloud
embeddings. We identified some biases in our dataset and refined it, which
improved the model's performance. Our model, even without the use of the point
cloud encodings, outperforms numerical models by an order of magnitude
regarding the runtime, while reaching a success rate of up to 90% of collision
free solutions on the test set.

Motivation: 为了解决机器人灵巧操作数据收集的挑战，传统遥操作方式效率低且不自然，需要一种能够最大化数据可转移性的收集范式。

Method: 开发perioperation范式，使用DEXOP被动外骨骼机械连接人手指和机器人手指，提供直接接触反馈和姿态镜像，在自然环境中收集多模态感官数据。

Abstract: We introduce perioperation, a paradigm for robotic data collection that
sensorizes and records human manipulation while maximizing the transferability
of the data to real robots. We implement this paradigm in DEXOP, a passive hand
exoskeleton designed to maximize human ability to collect rich sensory (vision
+ tactile) data for diverse dexterous manipulation tasks in natural
environments. DEXOP mechanically connects human fingers to robot fingers,
providing users with direct contact feedback (via proprioception) and mirrors
the human hand pose to the passive robot hand to maximize the transfer of
demonstrated skills to the robot. The force feedback and pose mirroring make
task demonstrations more natural for humans compared to teleoperation,
increasing both speed and accuracy. We evaluate DEXOP across a range of
dexterous, contact-rich tasks, demonstrating its ability to collect
high-quality demonstration data at scale. Policies learned with DEXOP data
significantly improve task performance per unit time of data collection
compared to teleoperation, making DEXOP a powerful tool for advancing robot
dexterity. Our project page is at https://dex-op.github.io.

Conclusion: 该方法在保持重建质量的同时显著提高了视角规划的计算效率，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Object reconstruction and inspection tasks play a crucial role in various
robotics applications. Identifying paths that reveal the most unknown areas of
the object becomes paramount in this context, as it directly affects
efficiency, and this problem is known as the view path planning problem.
Current methods often use sampling-based path planning techniques, evaluating
potential views along the path to enhance reconstruction performance. However,
these methods are computationally expensive as they require evaluating several
candidate views on the path. To this end, we propose a computationally
efficient solution that relies on calculating a focus point in the most
informative (unknown) region and having the robot maintain this point in the
camera field of view along the path. We incorporated this strategy into the
whole-body control of a mobile manipulator employing a visibility constraint
without the need for an additional path planner. We conducted comprehensive and
realistic simulations using a large dataset of 114 diverse objects of varying
sizes from 57 categories to compare our method with a sampling-based planning
strategy using Bayesian data analysis. Furthermore, we performed real-world
experiments with an 8-DoF mobile manipulator to demonstrate the proposed
method's performance in practice. Our results suggest that there is no
significant difference in object coverage and entropy. In contrast, our method
is approximately nine times faster than the baseline sampling-based method in
terms of the average time the robot spends between views.

Abstract: Cloud robotics has emerged as a promising technology for robotics
applications due to its advantages of offloading computationally intensive
tasks, facilitating data sharing, and enhancing robot coordination. However,
integrating cloud computing with robotics remains a complex challenge due to
network latency, security concerns, and the need for efficient resource
management. In this work, we present a scalable and intuitive framework for
testing cloud and edge robotic systems. The framework consists of two main
components enabled by containerized technology: (a) a containerized cloud
cluster and (b) the containerized robot simulation environment. The system
incorporates two endpoints of a User Datagram Protocol (UDP) tunnel, enabling
bidirectional communication between the cloud cluster container and the robot
simulation environment, while simulating realistic network conditions. To
achieve this, we consider the use case of cloud-assisted remote control for
aerial robots, while utilizing Linux-based traffic control to introduce
artificial delay and jitter, replicating variable network conditions
encountered in practical cloud-robot deployments.

Abstract: Continuum robots, inspired by octopus arms and elephant trunks, combine
dexterity with intrinsic compliance, making them well suited for unstructured
and confined environments. Yet their continuously deformable morphology poses
challenges for motion planning and control, calling for accurate but
lightweight models. We propose the Lightweight Actuation Space Energy Modeling
(LASEM) framework for cable driven continuum robots, which formulates actuation
potential energy directly in actuation space. LASEM yields an analytical
forward model derived from geometrically nonlinear beam and rod theories via
Hamilton's principle, while avoiding explicit modeling of cable backbone
contact. It accepts both force and displacement inputs, thereby unifying
kinematic and static formulations. Assuming the friction is neglected, the
framework generalizes to nonuniform geometries, arbitrary cable routings,
distributed loading and axial extensibility, while remaining computationally
efficient for real-time use. Numerical simulations validate its accuracy, and a
semi-analytical iterative scheme is developed for inverse kinematics. To
address discretization in practical robots, LASEM further reformulates the
functional minimization as a numerical optimization, which also naturally
incorporates cable potential energy without explicit contact modeling.

Abstract: Grasping assistance is essential for restoring autonomy in individuals with

categories and user intentions are diverse and unpredictable. We present
OVGrasp, a hierarchical control framework for soft exoskeleton-based grasp

open environments, OVGrasp incorporates a vision-language foundation model with
an open-vocabulary mechanism, allowing zero-shot detection of previously unseen

and linguistic cues to infer user intent, such as grasp or release, in
multi-object scenarios. We deploy the complete framework on a custom
egocentric-view wearable exoskeleton and conduct systematic evaluations on 15

outperforming state-of-the-art baselines and achieving improved kinematic
alignment with natural hand motion.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents possess significant commercial and
social value, and GUI agents powered by advanced multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential. Currently, existing GUI
agents usually utilize sequential episodes of multi-step operations across
pages as the prior GUI knowledge, which fails to capture the complex transition
relationship between pages, making it challenging for the agents to deeply
perceive the GUI environment and generalize to new scenarios. Therefore, we
design an automated pipeline to transform the sequential episodes into page
graphs, which explicitly model the graph structure of the pages that are
naturally connected by actions. To fully utilize the page graphs, we further
introduce Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to effectively
retrieve reliable perception guidelines of GUI from them, and a tailored
multi-agent framework PG-Agent with task decomposition strategy is proposed to
be injected with the guidelines so that it can generalize to unseen scenarios.
Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of
PG-Agent, even with limited episodes for page graph construction.

Result: 实验表明列生成技术优于现有方法，证明了外生变量多项式基数表示的可能性。

Conclusion: 列生成技术为计算准马尔可夫因果模型中的概率边界提供了有效的解决方案，特别是在单干预场景下表现出优越性能。

Abstract: We investigate partially identifiable queries in a class of causal models. We
focus on acyclic Structural Causal Models that are quasi-Markovian (that is,
each endogenous variable is connected with at most one exogenous confounder).
We look into scenarios where endogenous variables are observed (and a
distribution over them is known), while exogenous variables are not fully
specified. This leads to a representation that is in essence a Bayesian network
where the distribution of root variables is not uniquely determined. In such
circumstances, it may not be possible to precisely compute a probability value
of interest. We thus study the computation of tight probability bounds, a
problem that has been solved by multilinear programming in general, and by
linear programming when a single confounded component is intervened upon. We
present a new algorithm to simplify the construction of such programs by
exploiting input probabilities over endogenous variables. For scenarios with a
single intervention, we apply column generation to compute a probability bound
through a sequence of auxiliary linear integer programs, thus showing that a
representation with polynomial cardinality for exogenous variables is possible.
Experiments show column generation techniques to be superior to existing
methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出Diffusion-AC框架，将扩散概率模型应用于空中交通冲突检测与解决，通过多模态决策能力显著提升安全性和成功率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度强化学习方法在冲突检测与解决中存在"单模态偏差"，导致决策僵局，缺乏应对复杂动态约束的灵活性

Method: 采用扩散概率模型构建策略，通过值函数引导的反向去噪过程生成多模态动作分布，并结合密度渐进安全课程(DPSC)训练机制

Result: 在最具挑战性的高密度场景中，成功率高达94.1%，近距空中碰撞发生率比次优基准降低约59%

Conclusion: Diffusion-AC框架通过多模态决策能力显著提升了空中交通冲突解决的安全性和性能，为解决安全关键任务中的决策僵局问题提供了新途径

Abstract: In the context of continuously rising global air traffic, efficient and safe
Conflict Detection and Resolution (CD&R) is paramount for air traffic
management. Although Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a promising
pathway for CD&R automation, existing approaches commonly suffer from a
"unimodal bias" in their policies. This leads to a critical lack of
decision-making flexibility when confronted with complex and dynamic
constraints, often resulting in "decision deadlocks." To overcome this
limitation, this paper pioneers the integration of diffusion probabilistic
models into the safety-critical task of CD&R, proposing a novel autonomous
conflict resolution framework named Diffusion-AC. Diverging from conventional
methods that converge to a single optimal solution, our framework models its
policy as a reverse denoising process guided by a value function, enabling it
to generate a rich, high-quality, and multimodal action distribution. This core
architecture is complemented by a Density-Progressive Safety Curriculum (DPSC),
a training mechanism that ensures stable and efficient learning as the agent
progresses from sparse to high-density traffic environments. Extensive
simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
outperforms a suite of state-of-the-art DRL benchmarks. Most critically, in the
most challenging high-density scenarios, Diffusion-AC not only maintains a high
success rate of 94.1% but also reduces the incidence of Near Mid-Air Collisions
(NMACs) by approximately 59% compared to the next-best-performing baseline,
significantly enhancing the system's safety margin. This performance leap stems
from its unique multimodal decision-making capability, which allows the agent
to flexibly switch to effective alternative maneuvers.

TL;DR: 提出了Meta-Policy Deliberation Framework (MPDF)框架和SoftRankPO算法，通过让LLM智能体学习元认知策略来提升多智能体推理性能，在数学和通用推理基准上取得了4-5%的准确率提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体LLM系统采用固定的协作协议，忽视了智能体内部的审议能力，将智能体视为被动执行者，无法根据内部认知状态（如不确定性或置信度）调整策略

Method: MPDF框架让智能体学习去中心化的元认知动作策略（Persist、Refine、Concede），并开发了SoftRankPO强化学习算法，通过基于平滑正态分位数映射的奖励排序来稳定训练过程

Result: 在五个数学和通用推理基准测试中，MPDF与SoftRankPO相比六种最先进的启发式和基于学习的多智能体推理算法，平均准确率绝对提升了4-5%

Conclusion: 该工作提出了学习自适应元认知策略的新范式，将重点从设计固定协议转向学习动态审议策略，为多智能体LLM系统提供了新的发展方向

Abstract: Multi-agent systems of large language models (LLMs) show promise for complex
reasoning, but their effectiveness is often limited by fixed collaboration
protocols. These frameworks typically focus on macro-level orchestration while
overlooking agents' internal deliberative capabilities. This critical
meta-cognitive blindspot treats agents as passive executors unable to adapt
their strategy based on internal cognitive states like uncertainty or
confidence. We introduce the Meta-Policy Deliberation Framework (MPDF), where
agents learn a decentralized policy over a set of high-level meta-cognitive
actions: Persist, Refine, and Concede. To overcome the instability of
traditional policy gradients in this setting, we develop SoftRankPO, a novel
reinforcement learning algorithm. SoftRankPO stabilizes training by shaping
advantages based on the rank of rewards mapped through smooth normal quantiles,
making the learning process robust to reward variance. Experiments show that
MPDF with SoftRankPO achieves a a 4-5% absolute gain in average accuracy across
five mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks compared to six
state-of-the-art heuristic and learning-based multi-agent reasoning algorithms.
Our work presents a paradigm for learning adaptive, meta-cognitive policies for
multi-agent LLM systems, shifting the focus from designing fixed protocols to
learning dynamic, deliberative strategies.

TL;DR: 提出动态规划框架，让LLM智能体灵活决定何时进行规划，通过监督微调和强化学习训练，在长时程任务中实现更高效和可控的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如ReAct要求LLM在每个动作前都进行显式规划，这在计算上昂贵且会降低长时程任务的性能，而完全不规划又会限制性能表现

Method: 提出两阶段训练流程：1）在多样化合成数据上进行监督微调，为动态规划做准备；2）在长时程环境中使用强化学习来精炼这种能力

Result: 在Crafter环境中的实验表明，动态规划智能体更样本高效，能持续实现更复杂的目标，且可通过人类编写的规划有效引导，超越独立能力

Conclusion: 这是首个探索训练LLM智能体进行动态测试时计算分配的研究，为更高效、自适应和可控的智能体系统铺平了道路

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) to reason via reinforcement learning
(RL) significantly improves their problem-solving capabilities. In agentic
settings, existing methods like ReAct prompt LLMs to explicitly plan before
every action; however, we demonstrate that always planning is computationally
expensive and degrades performance on long-horizon tasks, while never planning
further limits performance. To address this, we introduce a conceptual
framework formalizing dynamic planning for LLM agents, enabling them to
flexibly decide when to allocate test-time compute for planning. We propose a
simple two-stage training pipeline: (1) supervised fine-tuning on diverse
synthetic data to prime models for dynamic planning, and (2) RL to refine this
capability in long-horizon environments. Experiments on the Crafter environment
show that dynamic planning agents trained with this approach are more
sample-efficient and consistently achieve more complex objectives.
Additionally, we demonstrate that these agents can be effectively steered by
human-written plans, surpassing their independent capabilities. To our
knowledge, this work is the first to explore training LLM agents for dynamic
test-time compute allocation in sequential decision-making tasks, paving the
way for more efficient, adaptive, and controllable agentic systems.

Motivation: 将心理学人格理论融入LLM智能体设计，通过人格条件化增强智能体行为的一致性和可解释性，为AI智能体提供心理学基础的行为模式。

Method: 基于Myers-Briggs类型指标(MBTI)，通过提示工程为智能体注入不同人格原型，使用官方16Personalities测试进行自动化特质验证，并可推广到Big Five等其他心理学框架。

Result: 人格条件化在不同任务中产生一致的行为偏差：情感表达型智能体在叙事生成中表现优异，分析型智能体在博弈论场景中采用更稳定策略；自我反思能提升合作和推理质量。

Conclusion: 该框架成功将心理学理论与LLM行为设计结合，为无需微调的心理增强型AI智能体奠定了基础，展示了跨心理学框架的良好泛化能力。

Abstract: We introduce MBTI-in-Thoughts, a framework for enhancing the effectiveness of
Large Language Model (LLM) agents through psychologically grounded personality
conditioning. Drawing on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), our method
primes agents with distinct personality archetypes via prompt engineering,
enabling control over behavior along two foundational axes of human psychology,
cognition and affect. We show that such personality priming yields consistent,
interpretable behavioral biases across diverse tasks: emotionally expressive
agents excel in narrative generation, while analytically primed agents adopt
more stable strategies in game-theoretic settings. Our framework supports
experimenting with structured multi-agent communication protocols and reveals
that self-reflection prior to interaction improves cooperation and reasoning
quality. To ensure trait persistence, we integrate the official 16Personalities
test for automated verification. While our focus is on MBTI, we show that our
approach generalizes seamlessly to other psychological frameworks such as Big
Five, HEXACO, or Enneagram. By bridging psychological theory and LLM behavior
design, we establish a foundation for psychologically enhanced AI agents
without any fine-tuning.

TL;DR: KG-SMILE是一个基于扰动的框架，为Graph RAG提供标记和组件级可解释性，通过识别对生成输出最有影响的图实体和关系来提高透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管检索增强生成(RAG)通过外部知识提高了准确性，但它仍然是不透明的黑盒系统，严重依赖数据质量，限制了在敏感领域的可靠性。

Method: 开发了方法无关的基于扰动的框架，通过应用受控扰动、计算相似度和训练加权线性替代模型，识别图实体和关系对生成输出的影响。

Result: KG-SMILE使用包括保真度、忠实度、一致性、稳定性和准确性在内的综合归因指标进行评估，产生稳定且与人类对齐的解释。

Conclusion: KG-SMILE能够在模型有效性和可解释性之间取得平衡，从而促进机器学习技术的更大透明度和信任度。

Abstract: Generative AI, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), has achieved impressive
progress but still produces hallucinations and unverifiable claims, limiting
reliability in sensitive domains. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves
accuracy by grounding outputs in external knowledge, especially in domains like
healthcare, where precision is vital. However, RAG remains opaque and
essentially a black box, heavily dependent on data quality. We developed a
method-agnostic, perturbation-based framework that provides token and
component-level interoperability for Graph RAG using SMILE and named it as
Knowledge-Graph (KG)-SMILE. By applying controlled perturbations, computing
similarities, and training weighted linear surrogates, KG-SMILE identifies the
graph entities and relations most influential to generated outputs, thereby
making RAG more transparent. We evaluate KG-SMILE using comprehensive
attribution metrics, including fidelity, faithfulness, consistency, stability,
and accuracy. Our findings show that KG-SMILE produces stable, human-aligned
explanations, demonstrating its capacity to balance model effectiveness with
interpretability and thereby fostering greater transparency and trust in
machine learning technologies.

Motivation: 推理需要在有限数据和分布偏移下适应新问题设置，现有测试平台缺乏对因果关系的系统性评估。

Method: 构建基于结构因果模型的全指定因果世界模型，通过数据增强提供观察、干预和反事实反馈的少样本学习演示。

Result: 开发了CausalARC测试平台，支持四种语言模型评估设置：测试时训练的抽象推理、上下文学习的反事实推理、程序合成和因果发现。

Conclusion: CausalARC为评估AI系统在因果推理和分布外泛化能力方面提供了系统化的实验框架。

Abstract: Reasoning requires adaptation to novel problem settings under limited data
and distribution shift. This work introduces CausalARC: an experimental testbed
for AI reasoning in low-data and out-of-distribution regimes, modeled after the
Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). Each CausalARC reasoning task is
sampled from a fully specified causal world model, formally expressed as a
structural causal model. Principled data augmentations provide observational,
interventional, and counterfactual feedback about the world model in the form
of few-shot, in-context learning demonstrations. As a proof-of-concept, we
illustrate the use of CausalARC for four language model evaluation settings:
(1) abstract reasoning with test-time training, (2) counterfactual reasoning
with in-context learning, (3) program synthesis, and (4) causal discovery with
logical reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在逻辑推理方面仍然容易出错，缺乏人类认知中基于感知运动经验的稳健心理表征，需要将理解建立在具身认知结构上。

Method: 开发基于图像模式的神经符号系统，使用答案集编程进行声明式空间推理，将认知结构形式化为可执行程序来指导LLM进行场景解释。

Result: 实验证明LLM能够通过具身认知结构解释场景，这些结构可以形式化为可执行程序，支持有效的逻辑推理并增强可解释性。

Conclusion: 虽然当前实现专注于空间原语，但为纳入更复杂动态表征建立了计算基础，展示了神经符号方法在提升LLM推理能力方面的潜力。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in natural language understanding, Large
Language Models (LLMs) remain error-prone when performing logical reasoning,
often lacking the robust mental representations that enable human-like
comprehension. We introduce a prototype neurosymbolic system, Embodied-LM, that
grounds understanding and logical reasoning in schematic representations based
on image schemas-recurring patterns derived from sensorimotor experience that
structure human cognition. Our system operationalizes the spatial foundations
of these cognitive structures using declarative spatial reasoning within Answer
Set Programming. Through evaluation on logical deduction problems, we
demonstrate that LLMs can be guided to interpret scenarios through embodied
cognitive structures, that these structures can be formalized as executable
programs, and that the resulting representations support effective logical
reasoning with enhanced interpretability. While our current implementation
focuses on spatial primitives, it establishes the computational foundation for
incorporating more complex and dynamic representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RL在提升大语言模型复杂推理能力方面效果显著，但其成功背后的机制仍然不明确，需要深入理解RL训练过程中的关键现象和动态

Method: 通过分析发现推理层次结构的存在，提出HIerarchy-Aware Credit Assignment (HICRA)算法，专注于优化高影响力的规划token，并使用语义熵作为战略探索的衡量指标

Result: HICRA算法显著优于现有基线方法，证明关注战略瓶颈是解锁高级推理能力的关键，语义熵被验证为比token级熵更优越的战略探索度量指标

Conclusion: RL提升LLM推理能力的核心在于层次化推理结构的发现，针对性地优化高层战略规划比均匀优化所有token更有效，为RL训练提供了新的理论指导和实践方法

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven highly effective at enhancing the
complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet underlying
mechanisms driving this success remain largely opaque. Our analysis reveals
that puzzling phenomena like ``aha moments", ``length-scaling'' and entropy
dynamics are not disparate occurrences but hallmarks of an emergent reasoning
hierarchy, akin to the separation of high-level strategic planning from
low-level procedural execution in human cognition. We uncover a compelling
two-phase dynamic: initially, a model is constrained by procedural correctness
and must improve its low-level skills. The learning bottleneck then decisively
shifts, with performance gains being driven by the exploration and mastery of
high-level strategic planning. This insight exposes a core inefficiency in
prevailing RL algorithms like GRPO, which apply optimization pressure
agnostically and dilute the learning signal across all tokens. To address this,
we propose HIerarchy-Aware Credit Assignment (HICRA), an algorithm that
concentrates optimization efforts on high-impact planning tokens. HICRA
significantly outperforms strong baselines, demonstrating that focusing on this
strategic bottleneck is key to unlocking advanced reasoning. Furthermore, we
validate semantic entropy as a superior compass for measuring strategic
exploration over misleading metrics such as token-level entropy.

Motivation: 解决SHAP在长时间序列上计算复杂度过高的问题，通过特征聚合减少特征数量，但最优分割策略仍不明确。

Method: 研究了8种不同时间序列分割算法，使用InterpretTime和AUC Difference两种评估方法，在单复变量和多复变量时间序列上进行实验。

Result: 分段数量对解释质量影响更大，均等长度分割表现最好，新的归因归一化技术能持续提升归因质量。

Conclusion: 建议使用均等长度分割策略和长度权重归一化技术来提高SHAP在时间序列分类中的解释效果。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) has become an increasingly important topic for
understanding and attributing the predictions made by complex Time Series
Classification (TSC) models. Among attribution methods, SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP) is widely regarded as an excellent attribution method; but
its computational complexity, which scales exponentially with the number of
features, limits its practicality for long time series. To address this, recent
studies have shown that aggregating features via segmentation, to compute a
single attribution value for a group of consecutive time points, drastically
reduces SHAP running time. However, the choice of the optimal segmentation
strategy remains an open question. In this work, we investigated eight
different Time Series Segmentation algorithms to understand how segment
compositions affect the explanation quality. We evaluate these approaches using
two established XAI evaluation methodologies: InterpretTime and AUC Difference.
Through experiments on both Multivariate (MTS) and Univariate Time Series
(UTS), we find that the number of segments has a greater impact on explanation
quality than the specific segmentation method. Notably, equal-length
segmentation consistently outperforms most of the custom time series
segmentation algorithms. Furthermore, we introduce a novel attribution
normalisation technique that weights segments by their length and we show that
it consistently improves attribution quality.

Conclusion: 身份人设的引入能够有效提升自动化红队的效果，为自动化与人工红队方法的补充探索了新方向。

Abstract: Recent developments in AI governance and safety research have called for
red-teaming methods that can effectively surface potential risks posed by AI
models. Many of these calls have emphasized how the identities and backgrounds
of red-teamers can shape their red-teaming strategies, and thus the kinds of
risks they are likely to uncover. While automated red-teaming approaches
promise to complement human red-teaming by enabling larger-scale exploration of
model behavior, current approaches do not consider the role of identity. As an
initial step towards incorporating people's background and identities in
automated red-teaming, we develop and evaluate a novel method, PersonaTeaming,
that introduces personas in the adversarial prompt generation process to
explore a wider spectrum of adversarial strategies. In particular, we first
introduce a methodology for mutating prompts based on either "red-teaming
expert" personas or "regular AI user" personas. We then develop a dynamic
persona-generating algorithm that automatically generates various persona types
adaptive to different seed prompts. In addition, we develop a set of new
metrics to explicitly measure the "mutation distance" to complement existing
diversity measurements of adversarial prompts. Our experiments show promising
improvements (up to 144.1%) in the attack success rates of adversarial prompts
through persona mutation, while maintaining prompt diversity, compared to
RainbowPlus, a state-of-the-art automated red-teaming method. We discuss the
strengths and limitations of different persona types and mutation methods,
shedding light on future opportunities to explore complementarities between
automated and human red-teaming approaches.

Motivation: 理解LLM是否表现出类似人类的人格特质模式，现有研究主要依赖简化的自报方法和启发式提示，缺乏行为验证。

Method: 从三个维度系统分析LLM人格：(1)训练阶段特质配置的动态演变；(2)自报特质在行为任务中的预测效度；(3)人格注入等干预措施对自报和行为的影响。

Result: 指令对齐（如RLHF、指令调优）显著稳定特质表达并增强特质相关性，但自报特质无法可靠预测行为，人格注入能改变自报特质但对行为影响有限或不一致。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了关于LLM人格的假设，强调需要区分表层特质表达和行为一致性，在对齐和可解释性方面需要更深入的评估。

Abstract: Personality traits have long been studied as predictors of human
behavior.Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) suggest similar
patterns may emerge in artificial systems, with advanced LLMs displaying
consistent behavioral tendencies resembling human traits like agreeableness and
self-regulation. Understanding these patterns is crucial, yet prior work
primarily relied on simplified self-reports and heuristic prompting, with
little behavioral validation. In this study, we systematically characterize LLM
personality across three dimensions: (1) the dynamic emergence and evolution of
trait profiles throughout training stages; (2) the predictive validity of
self-reported traits in behavioral tasks; and (3) the impact of targeted
interventions, such as persona injection, on both self-reports and behavior.
Our findings reveal that instructional alignment (e.g., RLHF, instruction
tuning) significantly stabilizes trait expression and strengthens trait
correlations in ways that mirror human data. However, these self-reported
traits do not reliably predict behavior, and observed associations often
diverge from human patterns. While persona injection successfully steers
self-reports in the intended direction, it exerts little or inconsistent effect
on actual behavior. By distinguishing surface-level trait expression from
behavioral consistency, our findings challenge assumptions about LLM
personality and underscore the need for deeper evaluation in alignment and
interpretability.

Conclusion: LLM代理缺乏内部一致性，这限制了其准确替代真实人类参与者的能力，是其在人类主体研究应用中的一个关键缺陷。

Abstract: The impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have fueled the
notion that synthetic agents can serve as substitutes for real participants in
human-subject research. In an effort to evaluate the merits of this claim,
social science researchers have largely focused on whether LLM-generated survey
data corresponds to that of a human counterpart whom the LLM is prompted to
represent. In contrast, we address a more fundamental question: Do agents
maintain internal consistency, retaining similar behaviors when examined under
different experimental settings? To this end, we develop a study designed to
(a) reveal the agent's internal state and (b) examine agent behavior in a basic
dialogue setting. This design enables us to explore a set of behavioral
hypotheses to assess whether an agent's conversation behavior is consistent
with what we would expect from their revealed internal state. Our findings on
these hypotheses show significant internal inconsistencies in LLMs across model
families and at differing model sizes. Most importantly, we find that, although
agents may generate responses matching those of their human counterparts, they
fail to be internally consistent, representing a critical gap in their
capabilities to accurately substitute for real participants in human-subject
research. Our simulation code and data are publicly accessible.

Motivation: 传统大语言模型在高度专业化或意外场景下容易失败，海上风电维护对准确性和安全性要求极高，需要专门的安全保障机制。

Method: 提出RAGuard框架，并行查询两个索引（技术手册和安全关键文档），分配独立的检索预算；开发SafetyClamp扩展，获取更大的候选池并进行硬钳位处理。

Result: 在稀疏、密集和混合检索范式下，安全召回率从RAG的几乎0%提升到RAGuard的50%以上，技术召回率保持在60%以上。

Conclusion: RAGuard和SafetyClamp有潜力为关键维护场景中的LLM决策支持建立新的安全保证标准。

Abstract: Accuracy and safety are paramount in Offshore Wind (OSW) maintenance, yet
conventional Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail when confronted with
highly specialised or unexpected scenarios. We introduce RAGuard, an enhanced
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that explicitly integrates
safety-critical documents alongside technical manuals.By issuing parallel
queries to two indices and allocating separate retrieval budgets for knowledge
and safety, RAGuard guarantees both technical depth and safety coverage. We
further develop a SafetyClamp extension that fetches a larger candidate pool,
"hard-clamping" exact slot guarantees to safety. We evaluate across sparse
(BM25), dense (Dense Passage Retrieval) and hybrid retrieval paradigms,
measuring Technical Recall@K and Safety Recall@K. Both proposed extensions of
RAG show an increase in Safety Recall@K from almost 0\% in RAG to more than
50\% in RAGuard, while maintaining Technical Recall above 60\%. These results
demonstrate that RAGuard and SafetyClamp have the potential to establish a new
standard for integrating safety assurance into LLM-powered decision support in
critical maintenance contexts.

Abstract: In supply chain management, planning is a critical concept. The movement of
physical products across different categories, from suppliers to warehouse
management, to sales, and logistics transporting them to customers, entails the
involvement of many entities. It covers various aspects such as demand
forecasting, inventory management, sales operations, and replenishment. How to
collect relevant data from an e-commerce platform's perspective, formulate
long-term plans, and dynamically adjust them based on environmental changes,
while ensuring interpretability, efficiency, and reliability, is a practical
and challenging problem. In recent years, the development of AI technologies,
especially the rapid progress of large language models, has provided new tools
to address real-world issues. In this work, we construct a Supply Chain
Planning Agent (SCPA) framework that can understand domain knowledge,
comprehend the operator's needs, decompose tasks, leverage or create new tools,
and return evidence-based planning reports. We deploy this framework in
JD.com's real-world scenario, demonstrating the feasibility of LLM-agent
applications in the supply chain. It effectively reduced labor and improved
accuracy, stock availability, and other key metrics.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理非结构化数据、探索灵活场景和处理多样化情境因素方面的能力，使其特别适合为复杂的社会政策制定提供新见解，特别是在影响全球1.5亿人的无家可归问题上。

Method: 开发了一个包含四个地理区域（美国南本德、西班牙巴塞罗那、南非约翰内斯堡、中国澳门）政策选择决策场景的新基准，采用人类发展能力方法的概念框架，并建立了将基准政策连接到基于代理模型的自动化流程。

Result: 研究结果显示利用LLMs进行社会政策制定具有良好潜力，如果与当地领域专家合作引入负责任的安全护栏和情境校准，LLMs可以大规模提供有价值的替代政策见解。

Conclusion: LLMs在社会政策制定方面展现出前景，通过与领域专家合作建立适当的保障措施，能够为人类提供有价值的政策建议和见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted in high-stakes
domains. Their capacity to process vast amounts of unstructured data, explore
flexible scenarios, and handle a diversity of contextual factors can make them
uniquely suited to provide new insights for the complexity of social
policymaking. This article evaluates whether LLMs' are aligned with domain
experts (and among themselves) to inform social policymaking on the subject of
homelessness alleviation - a challenge affecting over 150 million people
worldwide. We develop a novel benchmark comprised of decision scenarios with
policy choices across four geographies (South Bend, USA; Barcelona, Spain;
Johannesburg, South Africa; Macau SAR, China). The policies in scope are
grounded in the conceptual framework of the Capability Approach for human
development. We also present an automated pipeline that connects the
benchmarked policies to an agent-based model, and we explore the social impact
of the recommended policies through simulated social scenarios. The paper
results reveal promising potential to leverage LLMs for social policy making.
If responsible guardrails and contextual calibrations are introduced in
collaboration with local domain experts, LLMs can provide humans with valuable
insights, in the form of alternative policies at scale.

TL;DR: 基于Model Context Protocol的零训练、防幽醒的OMOP CDM映射系统，通过外部资源查询提高医学术语映射效率和准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OMOP CDM数据标准化过程中，源医学术语映射到标准概念的工作耗时费力且容易出错，而大语言模型存在幽醒问题不适合直接临床部署

Method: 基于Model Context Protocol(MCP)标准化框架，让LLM能够与外部资源和工具交互，实现零训练、可解释的映射系统

Result: 系统显著提高了映射效率和准确性，支持实时词汇查询和结构化推理输出，适用于探索性和生产环境

Conclusion: 该方法为OMOP CDM映射提供了一种高效、准确且可直接部署的解决方案，免去了训练成本和专家验证的需求

Abstract: The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM)
provides a standardized representation of heterogeneous health data to support
large-scale, multi-institutional research. One critical step in data
standardization using OMOP CDM is the mapping of source medical terms to OMOP
standard concepts, a procedure that is resource-intensive and error-prone.
While large language models (LLMs) have the potential to facilitate this
process, their tendency toward hallucination makes them unsuitable for clinical
deployment without training and expert validation. Here, we developed a
zero-training, hallucination-preventive mapping system based on the Model
Context Protocol (MCP), a standardized and secure framework allowing LLMs to
interact with external resources and tools. The system enables explainable
mapping and significantly improves efficiency and accuracy with minimal effort.
It provides real-time vocabulary lookups and structured reasoning outputs
suitable for immediate use in both exploratory and production environments.

Conclusion: 该框架提供了整合的数据驱动方法来解码游客感知，为旅游业、遗产保护和公共空间设计提供了重要决策支持

Abstract: Historic urban quarters play a vital role in preserving cultural heritage
while serving as vibrant spaces for tourism and everyday life. Understanding
how tourists perceive these environments is essential for sustainable,
human-centered urban planning. This study proposes a multidimensional
AI-powered framework for analyzing tourist perception in historic urban
quarters using multimodal data from social media. Applied to twelve historic
quarters in central Shanghai, the framework integrates focal point extraction,
color theme analysis, and sentiment mining. Visual focus areas are identified
from tourist-shared photos using a fine-tuned semantic segmentation model. To
assess aesthetic preferences, dominant colors are extracted using a clustering
method, and their spatial distribution across quarters is analyzed. Color
themes are further compared between social media photos and real-world street
views, revealing notable shifts. This divergence highlights potential gaps
between visual expectations and the built environment, reflecting both
stylistic preferences and perceptual bias. Tourist reviews are evaluated
through a hybrid sentiment analysis approach combining a rule-based method and
a multi-task BERT model. Satisfaction is assessed across four dimensions:
tourist activities, built environment, service facilities, and business
formats. The results reveal spatial variations in aesthetic appeal and
emotional response. Rather than focusing on a single technical innovation, this
framework offers an integrated, data-driven approach to decoding tourist
perception and contributes to informed decision-making in tourism, heritage
conservation, and the design of aesthetically engaging public spaces.

Conclusion: 该结构化、指标驱动的对比方法为生成式AI提供了健壁可扩展的评估框架，有效解决了黑盒模型评估的透明性和可扩展性挑战

Abstract: Generative AI (GEN AI) models have revolutionized diverse application domains
but present substantial challenges due to reliability concerns, including
hallucinations, semantic drift, and inherent biases. These models typically
operate as black-boxes, complicating transparent and objective evaluation.
Current evaluation methods primarily depend on subjective human assessment,
limiting scalability, transparency, and effectiveness. This research proposes a
systematic methodology using deterministic and Large Language Model
(LLM)-generated Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to continuously monitor and evaluate GEN
AI reliability. We construct two parallel KGs: (i) a deterministic KG built
using explicit rule-based methods, predefined ontologies, domain-specific
dictionaries, and structured entity-relation extraction rules, and (ii) an
LLM-generated KG dynamically derived from real-time textual data streams such
as live news articles. Utilizing real-time news streams ensures authenticity,
mitigates biases from repetitive training, and prevents adaptive LLMs from
bypassing predefined benchmarks through feedback memorization. To quantify
structural deviations and semantic discrepancies, we employ several established
KG metrics, including Instantiated Class Ratio (ICR), Instantiated Property
Ratio (IPR), and Class Instantiation (CI). An automated real-time monitoring
framework continuously computes deviations between deterministic and
LLM-generated KGs. By establishing dynamic anomaly thresholds based on
historical structural metric distributions, our method proactively identifies
and flags significant deviations, thus promptly detecting semantic anomalies or
hallucinations. This structured, metric-driven comparison between deterministic
and dynamically generated KGs delivers a robust and scalable evaluation
framework.

Motivation: 传统新颖性搜索方法在局部新颖性耗尽时容易陷入平台期，无法探索遥远未开发区域，需要新的探索策略来突破局部边界

Method: E&E策略交替进行局部新颖性驱动的扩展和基于视觉语言模型生成语言目标的目标导向远征，在语义空间中进行概念上有意义的探索

Conclusion: E&E能够突破局部新颖性边界，以人类可理解的方式探索行为景观，为人工生命等领域的开放式探索提供了有前景的模板

Abstract: Discovering diverse visual patterns in continuous cellular automata (CA) is
challenging due to the vastness and redundancy of high-dimensional behavioral
spaces. Traditional exploration methods like Novelty Search (NS) expand locally
by mutating known novel solutions but often plateau when local novelty is
exhausted, failing to reach distant, unexplored regions. We introduce
Expedition and Expansion (E&E), a hybrid strategy where exploration alternates
between local novelty-driven expansions and goal-directed expeditions. During
expeditions, E&E leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate linguistic
goals--descriptions of interesting but hypothetical patterns that drive
exploration toward uncharted regions. By operating in semantic spaces that
align with human perception, E&E both evaluates novelty and generates goals in
conceptually meaningful ways, enhancing the interpretability and relevance of
discovered behaviors. Tested on Flow Lenia, a continuous CA known for its rich,
emergent behaviors, E&E consistently uncovers more diverse solutions than
existing exploration methods. A genealogical analysis further reveals that
solutions originating from expeditions disproportionately influence long-term
exploration, unlocking new behavioral niches that serve as stepping stones for
subsequent search. These findings highlight E&E's capacity to break through
local novelty boundaries and explore behavioral landscapes in human-aligned,
interpretable ways, offering a promising template for open-ended exploration in
artificial life and beyond.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的搜索算法，将控制参数作为真正的决策点来处理，而非作为约束来嵌入，在自动规划中实现了更高效的搜索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将控制参数作为嵌入式约束处理，而非真正的决策点，导致搜索效率不高。需要一种明确将控制参数作为决策空间中真正决策点来处理的方法。

Method: 提出了一种最优优先的启发式搜索算法，在无限决策空间中运行，采用延迟部分扩展的概念，逐步扩展状态的子集。

Result: 证明了算法在某些条件下具有极限完备性，并显示出在解决涉及控制参数的规划问题时，该算法是现有方法的竞争性替代方案。

Conclusion: 明确将控制参数作为真正决策点的系统搜索方法在自动规划中具有效果，新的延迟部分扩展算法在处理连续数值变量时表现竞争力。

Abstract: In automated planning, control parameters extend standard action
representations through the introduction of continuous numeric decision
variables. Existing state-of-the-art approaches have primarily handled control
parameters as embedded constraints alongside other temporal and numeric
restrictions, and thus have implicitly treated them as additional constraints
rather than as decision points in the search space. In this paper, we propose
an efficient alternative that explicitly handles control parameters as true
decision points within a systematic search scheme. We develop a best-first,
heuristic search algorithm that operates over infinite decision spaces defined
by control parameters and prove a notion of completeness in the limit under
certain conditions. Our algorithm leverages the concept of delayed partial
expansion, where a state is not fully expanded but instead incrementally
expands a subset of its successors. Our results demonstrate that this novel
search algorithm is a competitive alternative to existing approaches for
solving planning problems involving control parameters.

Conclusion: 基于LLM的对话式AI代理为电商平台提供了比传统应用界面更轻量、更易用的替代方案，显著提升了用户操作效率。

Abstract: The emergence of agentic AI, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), marks a
paradigm shift from reactive generative systems to proactive, goal-oriented
autonomous agents capable of sophisticated planning, memory, and tool use. This
evolution presents a novel opportunity to address long-standing challenges in
complex digital environments. Core tasks on Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C)
e-commerce platforms often require users to navigate complex Graphical User
Interfaces (GUIs), making the experience time-consuming for both buyers and
sellers. This paper introduces a novel approach to simplify these interactions
through an LLM-powered agentic assistant. This agent functions as a new,
conversational entry point to the marketplace, shifting the primary interaction
model from a complex GUI to an intuitive AI agent. By interpreting natural
language commands, the agent automates key high-friction workflows. For
sellers, this includes simplified updating and renewal of listings, and the
ability to send bulk messages. For buyers, the agent facilitates a more
efficient product discovery process through conversational search. We present
the architecture for Facebook Marketplace Assistant (FaMA), arguing that this
agentic, conversational paradigm provides a lightweight and more accessible
alternative to traditional app interfaces, allowing users to manage their
marketplace activities with greater efficiency. Experiments show FaMA achieves
a 98% task success rate on solving complex tasks on the marketplace and enables
up to a 2x speedup on interaction time.

TL;DR: DeepMedix-R1是一个用于胸部X光片解读的医学基础模型，通过分阶段训练实现透明推理和局部可解释性，在报告生成和视觉问答任务上显著优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学基础模型通常以黑盒方式生成答案，缺乏透明的推理过程和局部可解释性，这阻碍了其在临床实践中的部署应用。

Method: 采用顺序训练流程：先在精选的CXR指令数据上微调获得基础解读能力，然后通过高质量合成推理样本实现冷启动推理，最后通过在线强化学习优化推理质量和生成性能。

Result: 在报告生成任务上比LLaVA-Rad和MedGemma分别提升14.54%和31.32%，在视觉问答任务上比MedGemma和CheXagent分别提升57.75%和23.06%。专家评审显示推理步骤的可解释性和临床合理性显著优于Qwen2.5-VL-7B模型。

Conclusion: 该研究推动了医学基础模型向整体性、透明性和临床可操作性方向发展，为CXR解读提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical foundation models (FMs) have shown tremendous promise amid the rapid
advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. However, current
medical FMs typically generate answers in a black-box manner, lacking
transparent reasoning processes and locally grounded interpretability, which
hinders their practical clinical deployments. To this end, we introduce
DeepMedix-R1, a holistic medical FM for chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation. It
leverages a sequential training pipeline: initially fine-tuned on curated CXR
instruction data to equip with fundamental CXR interpretation capabilities,
then exposed to high-quality synthetic reasoning samples to enable cold-start
reasoning, and finally refined via online reinforcement learning to enhance
both grounded reasoning quality and generation performance. Thus, the model
produces both an answer and reasoning steps tied to the image's local regions
for each query. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates substantial improvements
in report generation (e.g., 14.54% and 31.32% over LLaVA-Rad and MedGemma) and
visual question answering (e.g., 57.75% and 23.06% over MedGemma and CheXagent)
tasks. To facilitate robust assessment, we propose Report Arena, a benchmarking
framework using advanced language models to evaluate answer quality, further
highlighting the superiority of DeepMedix-R1. Expert review of generated
reasoning steps reveals greater interpretability and clinical plausibility
compared to the established Qwen2.5-VL-7B model (0.7416 vs. 0.2584 overall
preference). Collectively, our work advances medical FM development toward
holistic, transparent, and clinically actionable modeling for CXR
interpretation.

Conclusion: WorMI框架为具身智能体场景提供了可扩展的、数据高效的自适应解决方案，具有实际部署潜力。

Abstract: In embodied AI, a persistent challenge is enabling agents to robustly adapt
to novel domains without requiring extensive data collection or retraining. To
address this, we present a world model implanting framework (WorMI) that
combines the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with
independently learned, domain-specific world models through test-time
composition. By allowing seamless implantation and removal of the world models,
the embodied agent's policy achieves and maintains cross-domain adaptability.
In the WorMI framework, we employ a prototype-based world model retrieval
approach, utilizing efficient trajectory-based abstract representation
matching, to incorporate relevant models into test-time composition. We also
develop a world-wise compound attention method that not only integrates the
knowledge from the retrieved world models but also aligns their intermediate
representations with the reasoning model's representation within the agent's
policy. This framework design effectively fuses domain-specific knowledge from
multiple world models, ensuring robust adaptation to unseen domains. We
evaluate our WorMI on the VirtualHome and ALFWorld benchmarks, demonstrating
superior zero-shot and few-shot performance compared to several LLM-based
approaches across a range of unseen domains. These results highlight the
frameworks potential for scalable, real-world deployment in embodied agent
scenarios where adaptability and data efficiency are essential.

Result: 在基于AlfWorld的文本智能体环境中，相比Reflexion基线在执行准确性和鲁棒性方面获得一致提升，规则可接受性检查进一步提高了稳定性

Conclusion: MPR框架有效解决了LLM智能体的知识重用和约束执行问题，为多模态和多智能体扩展提供了未来方向

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents achieve impressive single-task performance
but commonly exhibit repeated failures, inefficient exploration, and limited
cross-task adaptability. Existing reflective strategies (e.g., Reflexion,
ReAct) improve per-episode behavior but typically produce ephemeral,
task-specific traces that are not reused across tasks. Reinforcement-learning
based alternatives can produce transferable policies but require substantial
parameter updates and compute. In this work we introduce Meta-Policy Reflexion
(MPR): a hybrid framework that consolidates LLM-generated reflections into a
structured, predicate-like Meta-Policy Memory (MPM) and applies that memory at
inference time through two complementary mechanisms soft memory-guided decoding
and hard rule admissibility checks(HAC). MPR (i) externalizes reusable
corrective knowledge without model weight updates, (ii) enforces domain
constraints to reduce unsafe or invalid actions, and (iii) retains the
adaptability of language-based reflection. We formalize the MPM representation,
present algorithms for update and decoding, and validate the approach in a
text-based agent environment following the experimental protocol described in
the provided implementation (AlfWorld-based). Empirical results reported in the
supplied material indicate consistent gains in execution accuracy and
robustness when compared to Reflexion baselines; rule admissibility further
improves stability. We analyze mechanisms that explain these gains, discuss
scalability and failure modes, and outline future directions for multimodal and
multi?agent extensions.

TL;DR: AutoPBO是一个基于大语言模型的框架，用于自动优化伪布尔优化(PBO)局部搜索求解器，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有局部搜索方法，并与最先进求解器保持竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 伪布尔优化(PBO)局部搜索求解器的性能高度依赖内部启发式策略，但设计这些策略需要大量专家努力和手动调优。虽然大语言模型在算法设计自动化方面显示出潜力，但在优化PBO求解器方面的应用尚未探索。

Method: 提出AutoPBO框架，利用大语言模型自动增强PBO局部搜索求解器。在四个公共基准测试上进行实验评估，包括真实世界基准、PB竞赛基准、整数线性规划优化基准和手工组合基准。

Result: AutoPBO相比之前的局部搜索方法有显著改进，同时与六个最先进竞争对手（包括NuPBO、OraSLS、PBO-IHS、RoundingSat、Gurobi和SCIP）保持竞争力。

Conclusion: AutoPBO为自动化局部搜索求解器设计提供了一种有前景的方法，证明了LLM在优化组合优化求解器方面的有效性。

Abstract: Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (PBO) provides a powerful framework for modeling
combinatorial problems through pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints. Local search
solvers have shown excellent performance in PBO solving, and their efficiency
is highly dependent on their internal heuristics to guide the search. Still,
their design often requires significant expert effort and manual tuning in
practice. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in
automating algorithm design, their application to optimizing PBO solvers
remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce AutoPBO, a novel LLM-powered
framework to automatically enhance PBO local search solvers. We conduct
experiments on a broad range of four public benchmarks, including one
real-world benchmark, a benchmark from PB competition, an integer linear
programming optimization benchmark, and a crafted combinatorial benchmark, to
evaluate the performance improvement achieved by AutoPBO and compare it with
six state-of-the-art competitors, including two local search PBO solvers NuPBO
and OraSLS, two complete PB solvers PBO-IHS and RoundingSat, and two mixed
integer programming (MIP) solvers Gurobi and SCIP. AutoPBO demonstrates
significant improvements over previous local search approaches, while
maintaining competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art competitors.
The results suggest that AutoPBO offers a promising approach to automating
local search solver design.

Motivation: 传统标记级强化学习框架与LLM的多步推理本质不匹配，存在理论空白，需要从理论层面解释推理过程中的过思等现象。

Method: 提出CoT-Space框架，将LLM推理重构为连续语义空间中的优化过程，从噪声视角和风险视角进行分析，探讨过拟合与不足拟合之间的基本批换。

Result: 理论分析表明最佳CoT长度的收敛是自然结果，并通过实验得到了强烈的实证验证。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅解释了过思等实证现象，为推理模型的发展提供了坚实的理论基础，有助于开发更有效和可推广的推理组件。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a pivotal approach for enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a significant
theoretical gap persists, as traditional token-level RL frameworks fail to
align with the reasoning-level nature of complex, multi-step thought processes
like Chain-of-Thought (CoT). To address this challenge, we introduce CoT-Space,
a novel theoretical framework that recasts LLM reasoning from a discrete
token-prediction task to an optimization process within a continuous,
reasoning-level semantic space. By analyzing this process from both a noise
perspective and a risk perspective, we demonstrate that the convergence to an
optimal CoT length is a natural consequence of the fundamental trade-off
between underfitting and overfitting. Furthermore, extensive experiments
provide strong empirical validation for our theoretical findings. Our framework
not only provides a coherent explanation for empirical phenomena such as
overthinking but also offers a solid theoretical foundation to guide the future
development of more effective and generalizable reasoning agents.

and exploit creative analogies across different domains. We want to harness
this kind of power and endow machines with it to make them more compatible with
human use. Previously we developed Representational Systems Theory (RST) to
study the structure and transformations of representations. In this paper we
present Oruga (caterpillar in Spanish; a symbol of transformation), an
implementation of various aspects of RST. Oruga consists of a core of data
structures corresponding to concepts in RST, a language for communicating with
the core, and an engine for producing transformations using a method we call
structure transfer. In this paper we present an overview of the core and
language of Oruga, with a brief example of the kind of transformation that
structure transfer can execute.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究发现，在神经符号LLM推理中，形式语言的选择是一个被忽视但关键的因素，会影响推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在形式推理能力方面仍然落后，神经符号LLM推理方法使用LLM作为自然语言到形式语言的翻译器，但影响其成功的关键因素尚不清楚。

Method: 通过比较四种形式语言在三个数据集和七个LLM上的表现，分析形式语言选择对推理能力的影响。

Result: 研究发现形式语言的选择会影响语法和语义推理能力，且不同LLM受到的影响程度不同。

Conclusion: 形式语言的选择是神经符号LLM推理中一个重要的中间语言挑战，需要仔细考虑以获得最佳推理性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve astonishing results on a wide range of
tasks. However, their formal reasoning ability still lags behind. A promising
approach is Neurosymbolic LLM reasoning. It works by using LLMs as translators
from natural to formal languages and symbolic solvers for deriving correct
results. Still, the contributing factors to the success of Neurosymbolic LLM
reasoning remain unclear. This paper demonstrates that one previously
overlooked factor is the choice of the formal language. We introduce the
intermediate language challenge: selecting a suitable formal language for
neurosymbolic reasoning. By comparing four formal languages across three
datasets and seven LLMs, we show that the choice of formal language affects
both syntactic and semantic reasoning capabilities. We also discuss the varying
effects across different LLMs.

Motivation: 在紧急情况下，快速重新计算飞行路径对航空安全至关重要，需要提高路径优化的计算速度。

Method: 训练RL经验组预计算近优路径，作为基础路径规划器的约束条件，缩小搜索空间。

Result: 使用空客A320性能模型进行实验，计算速度提高达50%，燃油消耗与无约束解法相比偏差仅为1%。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持路径质量的前提下显著提高了计算效率，适用于紧急情况下的快速路径重新规划。

Abstract: This paper explores the combination of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and
search-based path planners to speed up the optimization of flight paths for
airliners, where in case of emergency a fast route re-calculation can be
crucial. The fundamental idea is to train an RL Agent to pre-compute
near-optimal paths based on location and atmospheric data and use those at
runtime to constrain the underlying path planning solver and find a solution
within a certain distance from the initial guess. The approach effectively
reduces the size of the solver's search space, significantly speeding up route
optimization. Although global optimality is not guaranteed, empirical results
conducted with Airbus aircraft's performance models show that fuel consumption
remains nearly identical to that of an unconstrained solver, with deviations
typically within 1%. At the same time, computation speed can be improved by up
to 50% as compared to using a conventional solver alone.

Result: 两种算法都表现出诈唬行为但方式不同，成功诈唬率大致相同

Conclusion: 诈唬是游戏本身而非算法的本质特征，未来应研究不同诈唬风格和完整扑克游戏

Abstract: In the game of poker, being unpredictable, or bluffing, is an essential
skill. When humans play poker, they bluff. However, most works on
computer-poker focus on performance metrics such as win rates, while bluffing
is overlooked. In this paper we study whether two popular algorithms, DQN
(based on reinforcement learning) and CFR (based on game theory), exhibit
bluffing behavior in Leduc Hold'em, a simplified version of poker. We designed
an experiment where we let the DQN and CFR agent play against each other while
we log their actions. We find that both DQN and CFR exhibit bluffing behavior,
but they do so in different ways. Although both attempt to perform bluffs at
different rates, the percentage of successful bluffs (where the opponent folds)
is roughly the same. This suggests that bluffing is an essential aspect of the
game, not of the algorithm. Future work should look at different bluffing
styles and at the full game of poker. Code at

Motivation: 探讨AI是否能够超越人类成为宇宙的领导者，挑战了当前关于AI优势的主流观点

Method: 通过比较分析人类中枢神经系统与AI系统的本质差异，从生物学和哲学角度论证人类独特优势

Result: 发现情感体验和道德理解是人类区别于AI的关键特征，这些特征无法通过技术模拟或制造

Conclusion: DNA而非硅基技术才是宇宙领导权的最佳基础，人类的中枢神经系统提供了AI无法复制的道德领导资格

Abstract: Recent advances in AI raise the possibility that AI systems will one day be
able to do anything humans can do, only better. If artificial general
intelligence (AGI) is achieved, AI systems may be able to understand, reason,
problem solve, create, and evolve at a level and speed that humans will
increasingly be unable to match, or even understand. These possibilities raise
a natural question as to whether AI will eventually become superior to humans,
a successor "digital species", with a rightful claim to assume leadership of
the universe. However, a deeper consideration suggests the overlooked
differentiator between human beings and AI is not the brain, but the central
nervous system (CNS), providing us with an immersive integration with physical
reality. It is our CNS that enables us to experience emotion including pain,
joy, suffering, and love, and therefore to fully appreciate the consequences of
our actions on the world around us. And that emotional understanding of the
consequences of our actions is what is required to be able to develop
sustainable ethical systems, and so be fully qualified to be the leaders of the
universe. A CNS cannot be manufactured or simulated; it must be grown as a
biological construct. And so, even the development of consciousness will not be
sufficient to make AI systems superior to humans. AI systems may become more
capable than humans on almost every measure and transform our society. However,
the best foundation for leadership of our universe will always be DNA, not
silicon.

ontology for cooking, using temporal graphs to enable structured machine
understanding, precise interpretation, and scalable automation of culinary
processes - both in home kitchens and professional culinary settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究MLN在无限大域上的分布特性，探索不同软约束对随机结构极限行为的影响，以及MLN与其他概率图模型在渐近表达能力上的比较。

Method: 采用理论分析方法，研究三类具体MLN：(1)单一元关系符号的无量词MLN；(2)偏好较少三角形/团结构的MLN；(3)偏好较少高度数顶点的MLN。通过分析这些MLN在域大小趋于无穷时的行为特征。

Result: 发现不同软约束会导致截然不同的极限行为，权重对极限行为的影响因情况而异。证明了无量词MLN与提升贝叶斯网络在渐近意义上不可比，且MLN在大域上的分布与均匀分布集中在完全不同的可能世界空间区域。

Conclusion: MLN的软约束类型决定了其渐近行为特征，权重的影响具有条件依赖性。MLN与提升贝叶斯网络在表达能力上存在本质差异，MLN在大域上表现出与均匀分布截然不同的概率集中特性。

Abstract: A Markov logic network (MLN) determines a probability distribution on the set
of structures, or ``possible worlds'', with an arbitrary finite domain. We
study the properties of such distributions as the domain size tends to
infinity. Three types of concrete examples of MLNs will be considered, and the
properties of random structures with domain sizes tending to infinity will be
studied: (1) Arbitrary quantifier-free MLNs over a language with only one
relation symbol which has arity 1. In this case we give a pretty complete
characterization of the possible limit behaviours of random structures. (2) An
MLN that favours graphs with fewer triangles (or more generally, fewer
k-cliques). As a corollary of the analysis a ``$\delta$-approximate 0-1 law''
for first-order logic is obtained. (3) An MLN that favours graphs with fewer
vertices with degree higher than a fixed (but arbitrary) number. The analysis
shows that depending on which ``soft constraints'' an MLN uses the limit
behaviour of random structures can be quite different, and the weights of the
soft constraints may, or may not, have influence on the limit behaviour. It
will also be demonstrated, using (1), that quantifier-free MLNs and lifted
Bayesian networks (in a broad sense) are asymptotically incomparable, roughly
meaning that there is a sequence of distributions on possible worlds with
increasing domain sizes that can be defined by one of the formalisms but not
even approximated by the other. In a rather general context it is also shown
that on large domains the distribution determined by an MLN concentrates almost
all its probability mass on a totally different part of the space of possible
worlds than the uniform distribution does.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EvoEmo是一个进化强化学习框架，通过优化动态情感表达来提升LLM在复杂多轮谈判中的表现，显著优于传统策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理在谈判中忽视了情感的功能性作用，仅生成被动、偏好驱动的情感响应，容易被对手操纵和战略利用。

Method: 将情感状态转换建模为马尔可夫决策过程，采用基于种群的遗传优化算法，在不同谈判场景中演化高奖励情感策略。

Result: EvoEmo在成功率、效率和买家节省方面均优于传统策略和固定情感策略基线，实验和消融研究验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 自适应情感表达对于实现更有效的多轮谈判LLM代理至关重要，EvoEmo框架为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent research on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in Large Language Models
(LLMs) has demonstrated that agents can engage in \textit{complex},
\textit{multi-turn} negotiations, opening new avenues for agentic AI. However,
existing LLM agents largely overlook the functional role of emotions in such
negotiations, instead generating passive, preference-driven emotional responses
that make them vulnerable to manipulation and strategic exploitation by
adversarial counterparts. To address this gap, we present EvoEmo, an
evolutionary reinforcement learning framework that optimizes dynamic emotional
expression in negotiations. EvoEmo models emotional state transitions as a
Markov Decision Process and employs population-based genetic optimization to
evolve high-reward emotion policies across diverse negotiation scenarios. We
further propose an evaluation framework with two baselines -- vanilla
strategies and fixed-emotion strategies -- for benchmarking emotion-aware
negotiation. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that EvoEmo
consistently outperforms both baselines, achieving higher success rates, higher
efficiency, and increased buyer savings. This findings highlight the importance
of adaptive emotional expression in enabling more effective LLM agents for
multi-turn negotiation.

TL;DR: AlphaZero框架在测试环境可能变化时的适应性改进研究，通过简单修改显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AlphaZero通常假设训练和测试环境不变，这限制了其实际应用。本文研究如何在测试环境可能变化的情况下部署AlphaZero智能体

Method: 对标准AlphaZero框架进行简单修改，结合蒙特卡洛规划和预训练策略价值神经网络，在有限规划预算下提升性能

Result: 实验证明所提出的修改方法能够显著提升AlphaZero在变化测试环境中的性能表现

Conclusion: 通过简单的框架修改可以有效增强AlphaZero在动态环境中的适应能力，代码已在GitHub开源

Abstract: The AlphaZero framework provides a standard way of combining Monte Carlo
planning with prior knowledge provided by a previously trained policy-value
neural network. AlphaZero usually assumes that the environment on which the
neural network was trained will not change at test time, which constrains its
applicability. In this paper, we analyze the problem of deploying AlphaZero
agents in potentially changed test environments and demonstrate how the
combination of simple modifications to the standard framework can significantly
boost performance, even in settings with a low planning budget available. The
code is publicly available on GitHub.

Motivation: 解决LLM推理过程中发现的模式和见解在上下文重置后立即丢弃的问题，通过外部记忆持久化这些发现，并使其具有更广泛的复用性和可扩展性

Method: 从解决方案轨迹中提取可重用、模块化的自然语言抽象概念，为新查询选择性检索并集成到提示中，引入新的抽象和检索策略促进复用

Result: 在ARC-AGI基准上获得7.5%相对增益，性能随推理计算规模持续扩展，抽象概念在所有测试计算规模上都优于基线

Conclusion: 动态更新记忆在测试时优于固定记忆设置，支持通过解决更多问题和抽象更多模式到记忆中来实现自我改进的假设

Abstract: While inference-time scaling enables LLMs to carry out increasingly long and
capable reasoning traces, the patterns and insights uncovered during these
traces are immediately discarded once the context window is reset for a new
query. External memory is a natural way to persist these discoveries, and
recent work has shown clear benefits for reasoning-intensive tasks. We see an
opportunity to make such memories more broadly reusable and scalable by moving
beyond instance-based memory entries (e.g. exact query/response pairs, or
summaries tightly coupled with the original problem context) toward
concept-level memory: reusable, modular abstractions distilled from solution
traces and stored in natural language. For future queries, relevant concepts
are selectively retrieved and integrated into the prompt, enabling test-time
continual learning without weight updates. Our design introduces new strategies
for abstracting takeaways from rollouts and retrieving entries for new queries,
promoting reuse and allowing memory to expand with additional experiences. On
the challenging ARC-AGI benchmark, our method yields a 7.5% relative gain over
a strong no-memory baseline with performance continuing to scale with inference
compute. We find abstract concepts to be the most consistent memory design,
outscoring the baseline at all tested inference compute scales. Moreover, we
confirm that dynamically updating memory during test-time outperforms an
otherwise identical fixed memory setting with additional attempts, supporting
the hypothesis that solving more problems and abstracting more patterns to
memory enables further solutions in a form of self-improvement. Code available

Abstract: Promisedland is a mixed-reality (MR) narrative attraction that combines
cultural storytelling, ecological education, and an innovative hybrid
production workflow. Set in a future Earth suffering from elemental imbalance,
users embark on an interactive journey guided by symbolic characters to restore
harmony through the collection of five classical elements: metal, wood, water,
fire, and earth. To prototype this experience, we introduce a low-cost,
high-fidelity Diorama-to-Virtual pipeline - handcrafting physical scale models,
3D scanning, and integrating them into Unreal Engine. This process enables
rapid spatial prototyping while preserving the material expressiveness and
narrative consistency of the physical environment. To further enhance
immersion, the experience incorporates a Stewart Platform to provide motion
feedback synchronized with the virtual ride dynamics, reinforcing spatial
presence and embodied engagement. The final prototype runs on Meta Quest,
supporting dynamic interactions and real-time visual feedback. Promisedland
offers a replicable design blueprint for future XR narrative installations
across museums, cultural exhibitions, and themed entertainment. It proposes a
new framework for XR Narrative Attractions - where physical and digital
elements converge to deepen immersion, agency, and emotional engagement.

TL;DR: 研究AI解释对虚假信息检测的影响，探索内容解释、社交解释及其组合的有效性，发现解释类型间的对齐关系和呈现顺序会影响检测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可解释AI(XAI)方法主要关注内容解释（语言特征和句子结构），存在局限性，需要探索更广泛的解释类型如社交解释来提升用户虚假信息检测能力。

Method: 通过两个在线众包实验（COVID-19领域和政洽领域），比较内容解释、社交解释以及两者组合（对齐和不对齐情况）的有效性，分析解释类型呈现顺序的影响。

Result: AI解释总体上能有效帮助用户检测虚假信息，效果受内容解释和社交解释之间对齐关系的显著影响。解释类型的呈现顺序（内容先还是社交先）会影响检测准确率，且在不同领域（COVID-19 vs 政洽）存在差异。

Conclusion: 本研究为设计更有效的AI解释提供了指导，深化了对不同解释类型及其组合如何影响虚假信息检测的理解，强调了解释对齐关系和呈现顺序的重要性。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of AI explanation of misinformation,
where the goal is to identify explanation designs that help improve users'
misinformation detection abilities and their overall user experiences. Our work
is motivated by the limitations of current Explainable AI (XAI) approaches,
which predominantly focus on content explanations that elucidate the linguistic
features and sentence structures of the misinformation. To address this
limitation, we explore various explanations beyond content explanation, such as
"social explanation" that considers the broader social context surrounding
misinformation, as well as a "combined explanation" where both the content and
social explanations are presented in scenarios that are either aligned or
misaligned with each other. To evaluate the comparative effectiveness of these
AI explanations, we conduct two online crowdsourcing experiments in the
COVID-19 (Study 1 on Prolific) and Politics domains (Study 2 on MTurk). Our
results show that AI explanations are generally effective in aiding users to
detect misinformation, with effectiveness significantly influenced by the
alignment between content and social explanations. We also find that the order
in which explanation types are presented - specifically, whether a content or
social explanation comes first - can influence detection accuracy, with
differences found between the COVID-19 and Political domains. This work
contributes towards more effective design of AI explanations, fostering a
deeper understanding of how different explanation types and their combinations
influence misinformation detection.

Abstract: Eye-tracking offers rich insights into student cognition and engagement, but
remains underutilized in classroom-facing educational technology due to
challenges in data interpretation and accessibility. In this paper, we present
the iterative design and evaluation of a gaze-based learning analytics
dashboard for English Language Arts (ELA), developed through five studies
involving teachers and students. Guided by user-centered design and data
storytelling principles, we explored how gaze data can support reflection,
formative assessment, and instructional decision-making. Our findings
demonstrate that gaze analytics can be approachable and pedagogically valuable
when supported by familiar visualizations, layered explanations, and narrative
scaffolds. We further show how a conversational agent, powered by a large
language model (LLM), can lower cognitive barriers to interpreting gaze data by
enabling natural language interactions with multimodal learning analytics. We
conclude with design implications for future EdTech systems that aim to
integrate novel data modalities in classroom contexts.

Abstract: This paper presents Collective Landmark Mapper, a novel map-as-a-by-product
system for generating semantic landmark maps of indoor environments. Consider
users engaged in situated tasks that require them to navigate these
environments and regularly take notes on their smartphones. Collective Landmark
Mapper exploits the smartphone's IMU data and the user's free text input during
these tasks to identify a set of landmarks encountered by the user. The
identified landmarks are then aggregated across multiple users to generate a
unified map representing the positions and semantic information of all
landmarks. In developing the proposed system, we focused specifically on retail
applications and conducted a formative interview with stakeholders to confirm
their practical needs that motivate the map-as-a-byproduct approach. Our user
study demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed system and its superior
mapping performance in two different setups: creating a product availability
map from restocking checklist tasks at a retail store and constructing a room
usage map from office inspection tasks, further demonstrating the potential
applicability to non-retail applications.

TL;DR: 通过分析用户发帖频率来重新排序Twitter动态流，识别出低频率发帖者的推文更重要


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Twitter动态流中信息过载、噪音过多和重要推文被海量内容涂涂的问题

Method: 提出"低频率发帖者更有话说"假设，并建立六个新的推文重要性评估指标（转发、点赞、评论等交互数据）

Result: 研究发现每周发帖少于10条的用户更受关注，其推文更被认为重要

Conclusion: 低频率发帖者的推文应获得更高排名，这种重新排序方法可以有效减轻信息过载问题

Abstract: Twitter is one of the most popular social media platforms.With a large number
of tweets, the activity feed of users becomes noisy, challenging to read, and
most importantly tweets often get lost. We present a new approach to
personalise the ranking of the tweets toward solving the problem of information
overload which is achieved by analysing the relationship between the importance
of tweets to the frequency at which the author tweets. The hypothesis tested is
that "low-frequency tweeters have more to say", i.e. if a user who tweets
infrequently actually goes to the effort of tweeting, then it is more likely to
be of more importance or contain more "meaning" than a tweet by a user who
tweets continuously. We propose six new measures to evaluate the importance of
tweets based on the ability of the tweet to drive interaction among its
readers, which is measured through metrics such as retweets, favourites, and
comments, and the extent of the author's network interacting with the tweet.
Our study shows that users who tweeted less than ten tweets per week were more
likely to be perceived as important by their followers and have the most
important messages. This identified tweet-frequency band could be used to
reorder the activity feed of users and such reordering would ensure the
messages of low-frequency tweeters do not get lost in the stream of tweets.
This could also serve as a scoring index for Twitter users to identify users
frequently tweeting important messages.

TL;DR: 基于脉冲神经网络的指尖力解码框架，使用运动单元脉冲序列或肌电信号作为输入，实现高精度、低延迟的指尖力连续解码，在内存效率和鲁棒性方面具有优势


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恢复辅助技术中的自然手指控制需要高精度、高效率、高鲁棒性的连续运动意图解码，现有方法在内存占用和实时性方面存在不足

Method: 将脉冲神经网络与高密度肌内微电极阵列提取的运动单元活动相结合，系统评估不同SNN解码器配置，比较运动单元脉冲序列和脉冲编码肌电信号两种输入模式

Result: 浅层SNN能够以竞争性精度和最小延迟可靠解码指尖级运动意图，同时减少内存需求且无需外部预处理缓冲区

Conclusion: 为将SNN集成到指尖力解码系统提供了实用蓝图，展示了如何根据应用特定的精度、鲁棒性和内存效率要求策略性地选择输入表示

Abstract: Restoring naturalistic finger control in assistive technologies requires the
continuous decoding of motor intent with high accuracy, efficiency, and
robustness. Here, we present a spike-based decoding framework that integrates
spiking neural networks (SNNs) with motor unit activity extracted from
high-density intramuscular microelectrode arrays. We demonstrate simultaneous
and proportional decoding of individual finger forces from motor unit spike
trains during isometric contractions at 15% of maximum voluntary contraction
using SNNs. We systematically evaluated alternative SNN decoder configurations
and compared two possible input modalities: physiologically grounded motor unit
spike trains and spike-encoded intramuscular EMG signals. Through this
comparison, we quantified trade-offs between decoding accuracy, memory
footprint, and robustness to input errors. The results showed that shallow SNNs
can reliably decode finger-level motor intent with competitive accuracy and
minimal latency, while operating with reduced memory requirements and without
the need for external preprocessing buffers. This work provides a practical
blueprint for integrating SNNs into finger-level force decoding systems,
demonstrating how the choice of input representation can be strategically
tailored to meet application-specific requirements for accuracy, robustness,
and memory efficiency.

*Christian Merz,Lukas Schach,Marie Luisa Fiedler,Jean-Luc Lugrin,Carolin Wienrich,Marc Erich Latoschik*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度度量相似性学习的无干扰XR用户行为变化检测方法，通过高维嵌入向量识别不同虚拟化身引起的用户行为变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的XR研究中，用户行为变化（如Proteus效应）通常依赖主观问卷评估，缺乏客观、实时的测量方法。需要一种无干扰的原位测量技术来准确检测虚拟化身变化对用户行为的影响。

Method: 使用深度度量相似性学习构建生物特征用户模型，生成高维嵌入向量作为参考基准。通过头手运动数据分析，与传统的中心趋势运动分析和主观问卷方法进行对比。在within-subject研究中，让参与者使用不同身高（矮、实际身高、高）的虚拟化身完成水果收集任务。

Result: 主观评估确认了身体图式的有效操纵，非学习的客观运动分析显示不同条件间存在显著差异。相似性学习模型成功识别了虚拟化身条件变化引起的行为改变，在各种查询和参考数据配对中表现良好。

Conclusion: 该方法相比现有方法具有四大优势：无需额外用户输入的原位测量、通用可扩展的运动分析、用户个体层面的特异性分析、以及实时添加和评估用户的实时分析能力，为研究虚拟化身对行为影响提供了有效的客观测量工具。

Abstract: This paper introduces an unobtrusive in-situ measurement method to detect
user behavior changes during arbitrary exposures in XR systems. Here, such
behavior changes are typically associated with the Proteus effect or bodily
affordances elicited by different avatars that the users embody in XR. We
present a biometric user model based on deep metric similarity learning, which
uses high-dimensional embeddings as reference vectors to identify behavior
changes of individual users. We evaluate our model against two alternative
approaches: a (non-learned) motion analysis based on central tendencies of
movement patterns and subjective post-exposure embodiment questionnaires
frequently used in various XR exposures. In a within-subject study,
participants performed a fruit collection task while embodying avatars of
different body heights (short, actual-height, and tall). Subjective assessments
confirmed the effective manipulation of perceived body schema, while the
(non-learned) objective analyses of head and hand movements revealed
significant differences across conditions. Our similarity learning model
trained on the motion data successfully identified the elicited behavior change
for various query and reference data pairings of the avatar conditions. The
approach has several advantages in comparison to existing methods: 1) In-situ
measurement without additional user input, 2) generalizable and scalable motion
analysis for various use cases, 3) user-specific analysis on the individual
level, and 4) with a trained model, users can be added and evaluated in real
time to study how avatar changes affect behavior.

### [211] [Would I regret being different? The influence of social norms on attitudes toward AI usage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04241)
*Jaroslaw Kornowicz,Maurice Pape,Kirsten Thommes*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究表明社会规范可以减少算法厌恶，但规范如何建立尚不清楚。通过实验发现，反规范选择比规范遵循选择引发更高后悔，AI选择比人类选择更后悔，但AI支持规范能减弱这种厌恶。同伴和主管影响都相关但未显著影响后悔程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解社会规范（来自同伴或主管）如何影响AI使用行为，为组织促进有效AI采用提供实践指导。

Method: 在线小插曲实验，辅以参与者反规范行为后的感受和理由的定性数据。

Result: 反规范选择引发更高后悔；选择AI比选择人类更后悔；AI支持规范显著减弱算法厌恶；技术归责少于人类归责；同伴和主管影响相关但不显著影响后悔。

Conclusion: 嵌入社会规范的后悔厌恶是驱动AI相关决策中模仿行为的核心机制。

Abstract: Prior research shows that social norms can reduce algorithm aversion, but
little is known about how such norms become established. Most accounts
emphasize technological and individual determinants, yet AI adoption unfolds
within organizational social contexts shaped by peers and supervisors. We ask
whether the source of the norm-peers or supervisors-shapes AI usage behavior.
This question is practically relevant for organizations seeking to promote
effective AI adoption. We conducted an online vignette experiment, complemented
by qualitative data on participants' feelings and justifications after
(counter-)normative behavior. In line with the theory, counter-normative
choices elicited higher regret than norm-adherent choices. On average, choosing
AI increased regret compared to choosing an human. This aversion was weaker
when AI use was presented as the prevailing norm, indicating a statistically
significant interaction between AI use and an AI-favoring norm. Participants
also attributed less blame to technology than to humans, which increased regret
when AI was chosen over human expertise. Both peer and supervisor influence
emerged as relevant factors, though contrary to expectations they did not
significantly affect regret. Our findings suggest that regret aversion,
embedded in social norms, is a central mechanism driving imitation in
AI-related decision-making.

*Meisam Jamshidi Seikavandi,Fabricio Batista Narcizo,Ted Vucurevich,Andrew Burke Dittberner,Paolo Burelli*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: MuMTAffect是一个多模态多任务情感嵌入网络，通过整合多种生理信号（瞳孔、眼动、面部动作单元、皮肤电反应）和双任务学习（情感分类+人格预测），基于构建情感理论构建了更鲁棒的情感计算系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统情感计算方法往往忽视生理信号的跨模态交互和个人差异，需要一种能够同时处理多模态数据并考虑个体特质的情感识别框架。

Method: 使用基于Transformer的专用编码器处理每种生理模态，通过融合Transformer建模跨模态交互，采用核心情感编码与高层概念化分离的架构，并利用人格预测作为辅助任务生成用户特定的情感嵌入。

Result: 在AFFEC数据集上验证，刺激级情感线索和皮肤电反应显著改善唤醒度分类，瞳孔和注视数据增强效价辨别，多任务学习显著提升情感识别性能。

Conclusion: MuMTAffect提供了一个模块化、可扩展的多模态多任务框架，能够创建个性化的情境感知情感计算系统，为跨主体泛化提供了新的途径。

Abstract: We present MuMTAffect, a novel Multimodal Multitask Affective Embedding
Network designed for joint emotion classification and personality prediction
(re-identification) from short physiological signal segments. MuMTAffect
integrates multiple physiological modalities pupil dilation, eye gaze, facial
action units, and galvanic skin response using dedicated, transformer-based
encoders for each modality and a fusion transformer to model cross-modal
interactions. Inspired by the Theory of Constructed Emotion, the architecture
explicitly separates core affect encoding (valence/arousal) from higher-level
conceptualization, thereby grounding predictions in contemporary affective
neuroscience. Personality trait prediction is leveraged as an auxiliary task to
generate robust, user-specific affective embeddings, significantly enhancing
emotion recognition performance. We evaluate MuMTAffect on the AFFEC dataset,
demonstrating that stimulus-level emotional cues (Stim Emo) and galvanic skin
response substantially improve arousal classification, while pupil and gaze
data enhance valence discrimination. The inherent modularity of MuMTAffect
allows effortless integration of additional modalities, ensuring scalability
and adaptability. Extensive experiments and ablation studies underscore the
efficacy of our multimodal multitask approach in creating personalized,
context-aware affective computing systems, highlighting pathways for further
advancements in cross-subject generalisation.

TL;DR: HumAIne-chatbot是一个通过用户画像框架实现个性化响应的对话AI系统，使用在线强化学习结合隐式和显式反馈来动态调整对话策略，实验显示在用户满意度、个性化准确性和任务完成度方面均有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对话AI系统通常提供通用的、一刀切的交互方式，忽视了用户个体特征，缺乏自适应对话管理能力。

Method: 系统在GPT生成的虚拟角色数据集上进行预训练建立用户类型先验，通过在线强化学习代理结合隐式信号（输入速度、情感、参与时长）和显式反馈（点赞/点踩）来优化每个用户的模型，动态调整对话策略的内容和风格。

Result: 在50个合成角色的多领域对话实验中，启用个性化功能后用户满意度、个性化准确性和任务完成度均获得一致提升，统计分析显示个性化与非个性化条件之间存在显著差异且效应量大。

Conclusion: AI驱动的用户画像方法有效，为未来真实世界验证提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Current conversational AI systems often provide generic, one-size-fits-all
interactions that overlook individual user characteristics and lack adaptive
dialogue management. To address this gap, we introduce
\textbf{HumAIne-chatbot}, an AI-driven conversational agent that personalizes
responses through a novel user profiling framework. The system is pre-trained
on a diverse set of GPT-generated virtual personas to establish a broad prior
over user types. During live interactions, an online reinforcement learning
agent refines per-user models by combining implicit signals (e.g. typing speed,
sentiment, engagement duration) with explicit feedback (e.g., likes and
dislikes). This profile dynamically informs the chatbot dialogue policy,
enabling real-time adaptation of both content and style. To evaluate the
system, we performed controlled experiments with 50 synthetic personas in
multiple conversation domains. The results showed consistent improvements in
user satisfaction, personalization accuracy, and task achievement when
personalization features were enabled. Statistical analysis confirmed
significant differences between personalized and nonpersonalized conditions,
with large effect sizes across key metrics. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of AI-driven user profiling and provide a strong foundation for
future real-world validation.

TL;DR: LLMs在临床文档记录中具有潜力，但成功应用需要灵活的集成方式和支持临床医生自主权，同时考虑工作流程复杂性和系统约束等社会技术因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs如何帮助儿科康复机构的职业治疗师减轻文档负担，虽然文档记录被视为高容量低风险任务，但实际应用涉及复杂的社会技术考量。

Method: 在加拿大安大略省KidsAbility儿科康复机构进行的定性研究，20名临床医生参与试点项目，使用两种AI技术：通用专有LLM和基于历史文档微调的定制模型。

Result: 研究发现文档挑战具有社会技术性质，受临床工作流程、组织政策和系统约束影响。四个关键主题：工作流程异质性、文档负担的系统性、需要灵活工具和临床医生自主权、临床医生与AI系统之间的相互学习。

Conclusion: LLMs在减轻文档任务方面显示潜力，但成功取决于支持临床医生自主权的灵活适应性集成。持续采用需要反映临床环境复杂性的培训计划和实施策略。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are often proposed as tools to streamline
clinical documentation, a task viewed as both high-volume and low-risk.
However, even seemingly straightforward applications of LLMs raise complex
sociotechnical considerations to translate into practice. This case study,
conducted at KidsAbility, a pediatric rehabilitation facility in Ontario,
Canada examined the use of LLMs to support occupational therapists in reducing
documentation burden.We conducted a qualitative study involving 20 clinicians
who participated in pilot programs using two AI technologies: a general-purpose
proprietary LLM and a bespoke model fine-tuned on proprietary historical
documentation.
  Our findings reveal that documentation challenges are sociotechnical in
nature, shaped by clinical workflows, organizational policies, and system
constraints. Four key themes emerged: (1) the heterogeneity of workflows, (2)
the documentation burden is systemic and not directly linked to the creation of
any single type of documentation, (3) the need for flexible tools and clinician
autonomy, and (4) effective implementation requires mutual learning between
clinicians and AI systems.
  While LLMs show promise in easing documentation tasks, their success will
depend on flexible, adaptive integration that supports clinician autonomy.
Beyond technical performance, sustained adoption will require training programs
and implementation strategies that reflect the complexity of clinical
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决现有基于云端LLM服务的机器人原型工具在隐私、延迟和定制化方面的限制，开发一个本地化、模块化的工具包来支持人机交互研究的快速原型开发。

Method: 开发基于Web的工具包，支持文本输入、按钮激活语音和唤醒词命令等多模态交互，提供直观控制面板实时配置化身外观、行为、语言和声音，采用本地LLM推理确保设备端功能。

Conclusion: SRWToolkit能够快速高效地开发定制化的机器人角色，支持人机交互研究的可扩展性，为研究人员提供了强大的原型开发工具。

Abstract: We present SRWToolkit, an open-source Wizard of Oz toolkit designed to
facilitate the rapid prototyping of social robotic avatars powered by local
large language models (LLMs). Our web-based toolkit enables multimodal
interaction through text input, button-activated speech, and wake-word command.
The toolkit offers real-time configuration of avatar appearance, behavior,
language, and voice via an intuitive control panel. In contrast to prior works
that rely on cloud-based LLM services, SRWToolkit emphasizes modularity and
ensures on-device functionality through local LLM inference. In our small-scale
user study ($n=11$), participants created and interacted with diverse robotic
roles (hospital receptionist, mathematics teacher, and driving assistant),
which demonstrated positive outcomes in the toolkit's usability, trust, and
user experience. The toolkit enables rapid and efficient development of robot
characters customized to researchers' needs, supporting scalable research in

TL;DR: 社交机器人在健康教练中处理敏感信息时，用户控制权是影响隐私感知的最重要因素，较信息透明性和主动性更关键。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交机器人在健康教练中处理敏感信息，隐私问题重要但知识缺口，需要系统研究影响用户隐私感知的关键因素。

Method: 通过在线实验（N=200）测试三个因素：信息使用透明度、用户控制级别、机器人主动性行为。

Result: 用户在授权数据访问后仍需明确控制信息解释与共享方式；提供用户控制的实验组在隐私适度和信任度上获得显著更高评分；透明性和主动性影响较小且无显著效果。

Conclusion: 仅仅告知用户或主动分享不够，必须配合用户控制机制，应继续研究允许用户管理机器人信息处理和共享的方法。

Abstract: Social robots are increasingly recognized as valuable supporters in the field
of well-being coaching. They can function as independent coaches or provide
support alongside human coaches, and healthcare professionals. In coaching
interactions, these robots often handle sensitive information shared by users,
making privacy a relevant issue. Despite this, little is known about the
factors that shape users' privacy perceptions. This research aims to examine
three key factors systematically: (1) the transparency about information usage,
(2) the level of specific user control over how the robot uses their
information, and (3) the robot's behavioral approach - whether it acts
proactively or only responds on demand. Our results from an online study (N =
200) show that even when users grant the robot general access to personal data,
they additionally expect the ability to explicitly control how that information
is interpreted and shared during sessions. Experimental conditions that
provided such control received significantly higher ratings for perceived
privacy appropriateness and trust. Compared to user control, the effects of
transparency and proactivity on privacy appropriateness perception were low,
and we found no significant impact. The results suggest that merely informing
users or proactive sharing is insufficient without accompanying user control.
These insights underscore the need for further research on mechanisms that
allow users to manage robots' information processing and sharing, especially
when social robots take on more proactive roles alongside humans.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 司法审议过程的复杂性对司法系统的效能和公平性评估至关重要，但实证研究面临伦理和实践障碍，需要创新的模拟方法来研究司法决策动态。

Method: 构建包含法官、检察官、辩护律师和多名审判员的多智能体系统，使用检索增强生成技术基于印度刑法典和宪法等法律文档生成法律论证，通过迭代审议达成共识判决。

Result: 开发了一个可配置、可解释的多智能体平台，能够生成具有法律依据的指令和论证，并支持引用来源，增强了模拟的真实性和透明度。

Conclusion: SAMVAD为研究印度法律背景下的法律推理和群体决策动态提供了一个创新的模拟平台，通过RAG技术实现了可验证的法律基础，具有重要的研究和实践价值。

Abstract: Understanding the complexities of judicial deliberation is crucial for
assessing the efficacy and fairness of a justice system. However, empirical
studies of judicial panels are constrained by significant ethical and practical
barriers. This paper introduces SAMVAD, an innovative Multi-Agent System (MAS)
designed to simulate the deliberation process within the framework of the
Indian justice system.
  Our system comprises agents representing key judicial roles: a Judge, a
Prosecution Counsel, a Defense Counsel, and multiple Adjudicators (simulating a
judicial bench), all powered by large language models (LLMs). A primary
contribution of this work is the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG), grounded in a domain-specific knowledge base of landmark Indian legal
documents, including the Indian Penal Code and the Constitution of India. This
RAG functionality enables the Judge and Counsel agents to generate legally
sound instructions and arguments, complete with source citations, thereby
enhancing both the fidelity and transparency of the simulation.
  The Adjudicator agents engage in iterative deliberation rounds, processing
case facts, legal instructions, and arguments to reach a consensus-based
verdict. We detail the system architecture, agent communication protocols, the
RAG pipeline, the simulation workflow, and a comprehensive evaluation plan
designed to assess performance, deliberation quality, and outcome consistency.
  This work provides a configurable and explainable MAS platform for exploring
legal reasoning and group decision-making dynamics in judicial simulations,
specifically tailored to the Indian legal context and augmented with verifiable
legal grounding via RAG.

TL;DR: 这篇论文将信任形式化为重复游戏中的认知短措，发现在检查别人行为成本较高时，基于信任的策略能够在许多社会困境中冠击标准互惠策略，提高整体合作水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 游戏理论模型常常混淆合作行为和信任，导致难以测量信任和确定其在不同社会困境中的作用。需要形式化信任概念并分析其对合作的影响。

Method: 将信任形式化为重复游戏中的认知短措：一旦观察到合作水平超过阈值，就避免检查对方行动。系统分析基于信任的策略在两游戏者对称社会困境游戏中的进化。

Result: 当检查对方行为的成本较高时，基于信任的策略在许多社会困境中能够冠击标准互惠策略（如一拍还一拍）。信任的存在提高了群体的整体合作水平，尤其是在行动可能出现无意错误的情况下。

Conclusion: 信任简化策略为个体带来适应性好处，并为信任如何促进不同类型社交互动中的合作提供了形式理论基础。这些发现对人类与人工智能代理之间的互动具有重要意义。

Abstract: Trust is often thought to increase cooperation. However, game-theoretic
models often fail to distinguish between cooperative behaviour and trust. This
makes it difficult to measure trust and determine its effect in different
social dilemmas. We address this here by formalising trust as a cognitive
shortcut in repeated games. This functions by avoiding checking a partner's
actions once a threshold level of cooperativeness has been observed. We
consider trust-based strategies that implement this heuristic, and
systematically analyse their evolution across the space of two-player symmetric
social dilemma games. We find that where it is costly to check whether another
agent's actions were cooperative, as is the case in many real-world settings,
then trust-based strategies can outcompete standard reciprocal strategies such
as Tit-for-Tat in many social dilemmas. Moreover, the presence of trust
increases the overall level of cooperation in the population, especially in
cases where agents can make unintentional errors in their actions. This occurs
even in the presence of strategies designed to build and then exploit trust.
Overall, our results demonstrate the individual adaptive benefit to an agent of
using a trust heuristic, and provide a formal theory for how trust can promote
cooperation in different types of social interaction. We discuss the
implications of this for interactions between humans and artificial
intelligence agents.

Conclusion: 该方法为自动驾驶横向规划提供了有效的自动参数优化方案，能够处理噪声环境并提升性能

Abstract: Advanced driver assistance systems have improved comfort, safety, and
efficiency of modern vehicles. However, sensor limitations lead to noisy lane
estimates that pose a significant challenge in developing performant control
architectures. Lateral trajectory planning often employs an optimal control
formulation to maintain lane position and minimize steering effort. The
parameters are often tuned manually, which is a time-intensive procedure. This
paper presents an automatic parameter tuning method for lateral planning in
lane-keeping scenarios based on recorded data, while taking into account noisy
road estimates. By simulating the lateral vehicle behavior along a reference
curve, our approach efficiently optimizes planner parameters for automated
driving and demonstrates improved performance on previously unseen test data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对强化学习需要大量试验才能学习新任务的批评，寻求更高效的碰撞避免方法来解决无人机遇到意外障碍物的问题。

Method: 使用Dubins' car模型，结合平坦性控制和HEOL反馈设置，以及最新的无模型预测控制方法。

Result: 两种方法都取得了令人信服的实验结果，基于模型的方法略优。两种方法都对随机生成的失配/干扰表现出满意的鲁棒性，无模型方法的鲁棒性更佳。

Conclusion: 所提出的两种方法计算负担低，鲁棒性好，相比当前流行的机器学习技术可能更容易获得这些特性。

Abstract: This communication on collision avoidance with unexpected obstacles is
motivated by some critical appraisals on reinforcement learning (RL) which
"requires ridiculously large numbers of trials to learn any new task" (Yann
LeCun). We use the classic Dubins' car in order to replace RL with
flatness-based control, combined with the HEOL feedback setting, and the latest
model-free predictive control approach. The two approaches lead to convincing
computer experiments where the results with the model-based one are only
slightly better. They exhibit a satisfactory robustness with respect to
randomly generated mismatches/disturbances, which become excellent in the
model-free case. Those properties would have been perhaps difficult to obtain
with today's popular machine learning techniques in AI. Finally, we should
emphasize that our two methods require a low computational burden.

Abstract: The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources and
power-electronics interfaces in DC microgrids, coupled with rising cyber
threats, necessitates primary controllers that are provably safe,
cyber-resilient, and practical. The increasing penetration of distributed
energy resources and power-electronics interfaces in DC microgrids, coupled
with rising cyber threats, necessitates primary controllers that are provably
safe, cyber-resilient, and practical. Conventional droop-based methods remain
prevalent due to their simplicity, yet their design is largely empirical and
conservative, lacking rigorous guarantees. Advanced strategies improve certain
aspects, but often sacrifice scalability, robustness, or formal safety. In this
work, we propose a Distributed Safety-Critical Controller (DSCC) that
systematically integrates global stabilization with formal safety guarantees in
a fully decentralized manner. Leveraging control barrier functions and the
port-Hamiltonian system theory, the DSCC achieves scalable safe stabilization
while preserving real-time implementability. High-fidelity switched-circuit
simulations validate the controller's advantages under various contingencies.
This framework paves the way for resilient, safety-critical, and scalable
control in next-generation DC microgrids.

Conclusion: 柔性夹持天线SWIPT系统通过优化的部署方案和传输协议，能够有效平衡能量收集和信息传输性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we studies the performance of a novel simultaneous wireless
information and power transfer (SWIPT) system enabled by a flexible
pinching-antenna. To support flexible deployment and optimize energy-rate
performance, we propose three practical pinching antenna placement-schemes: the
edge deployment scheme (EDS), the center deployment scheme (CDS), and the
diagonal deployment scheme (DDS). Moreover, a hybrid time-switching (TS) and
power-splitting (PS) protocol is introduced, allowing dynamic adjustment
between energy harvesting and information decoding. Under each deployment
strategy and the transmission protocol, closed-form expressions for the average
harvested energy and average achievable rate of a randomly located user
equipment (UE) are derived based on the optimal positioning of the
pinching-antenna. Numerical simulations confirm the accuracy of the theoretical
analysis and illustrate the trade-off between rate and energy harvesting under
different schemes.

Abstract: Neural networks capable of approximating complex nonlinearities have found
extensive application in data-driven control of nonlinear dynamical systems.
However, fast online identification and control of unknown dynamics remain
central challenges. This paper integrates echo-state networks (ESNs) --
reservoir computing models implemented with recurrent neural networks -- and
model predictive path integral (MPPI) control -- sampling-based variants of
model predictive control -- to meet these challenges. The proposed reservoir
predictive path integral (RPPI) enables fast learning of nonlinear dynamics
with ESN and exploits the learned nonlinearities directly in parallelized MPPI
control computation without linearization approximations. The framework is
further extended to uncertainty-aware RPPI (URPPI), which leverages ESN
uncertainty to balance exploration and exploitation: exploratory inputs
dominate during early learning, while exploitative inputs prevail as model
confidence grows. Experiments on controlling the Duffing oscillator and
four-tank systems demonstrate that URPPI improves control performance, reducing
control costs by up to 60% compared to traditional quadratic programming-based
model predictive control methods.

Abstract: This paper proposes a fully data-driven motion-planning framework for
homogeneous linear multi-agent systems that operate in shared, obstacle-filled
workspaces without access to explicit system models. Each agent independently
learns its closed-loop behavior from experimental data by solving convex
semidefinite programs that generate locally invariant ellipsoids and
corresponding state-feedback gains. These ellipsoids, centered along grid-based
waypoints, certify the dynamic feasibility of short-range transitions and
define safe regions of operation. A sampling-based planner constructs a tree of
such waypoints, where transitions are allowed only when adjacent ellipsoids
overlap, ensuring invariant-to-invariant transitions and continuous safety. All
agents expand their trees simultaneously and are coordinated through a
space-time reservation table that guarantees inter-agent safety by preventing
simultaneous occupancy and head-on collisions. Each successful edge in the tree
is equipped with its own local controller, enabling execution without
re-solving optimization problems at runtime. The resulting trajectories are not
only dynamically feasible but also provably safe with respect to both
environmental constraints and inter-agent collisions. Simulation results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in synthesizing synchronized,
safe trajectories for multiple agents under shared dynamics and constraints,
using only data and convex optimization tools.

Result: 通过数值示例验证了所提出程序的高效性

Conclusion: 该方法为控制屏障函数的鲁棒约束验证提供了有效的解决方案，具有样本效率高的优点

Abstract: Control Invariant (CI) sets are instrumental in certifying the safety of
dynamical systems. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are effective tools to
compute such sets, since the zero sublevel sets of CBFs are CI sets. However,
computing CBFs generally involves addressing a complex robust optimization
problem, which can be intractable. Scenario-based methods have been proposed to
simplify this computation. Then, one needs to verify if the CBF actually
satisfies the robust constraints. We present an approach to perform this
verification that relies on Lipschitz arguments, and forms the basis of a
certification algorithm designed for sample efficiency. Through a numerical
example, we validated the efficiency of the proposed procedure.

Abstract: As the number of satellites in orbit has increased exponentially in recent
years, ensuring their correct functionality has started to require automated
methods to decrease human workload. In this work, we present an algorithm that
analyzes the on-board data related to friction from the Reaction Wheel
Assemblies (RWA) of a satellite and determines their operating status,
distinguishing between nominal status and several possible anomalies that
require preventive measures to be taken. The algorithm first uses a model based
on hybrid systems theory to extract the information relevant to the problem.
The extraction process combines techniques in changepoint detection, dynamic
programming, and maximum likelihood in a structured way. A classifier then uses
the extracted information to determine the status of the RWA. This last
classifier has been previously trained with a labelled dataset produced by a
high-fidelity simulator, comprised for the most part of nominal data. The final
algorithm combines model-based and data-based approaches to obtain satisfactory
results with an accuracy around 95%.

Abstract: Forklifts are essential for transporting goods in industrial environments.
These machines face wear and tear during field operations, along with rough
terrain, tight spaces and complex handling scenarios. This increases the
likelihood of unintended impacts, such as collisions with goods,
infrastructure, or other machinery. In addition, deliberate misuse has been
stated, compromising safety and equipment integrity. This paper presents a
low-cost and low-power impact detection system based on multiple wireless
sensor nodes measuring 3D accelerations. These were deployed in a measurement
campaign covering realworld operational scenarios. An algorithm was developed,
based on this collected data, to differentiate high-impact events from normal
usage and to localize detected collisions on the forklift. The solution
successfully detects and localizes impacts, while maintaining low power
consumption, enabling reliable forklift monitoring with multi-year sensor
autonomy.

Conclusion: 所提出的分布鲁棒方法能够有效处理马尔可夫跳变系统中的模态不确定性，为不可靠网络环境下的状态估计提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of remote state estimation for Markov jump
linear systems in the presence of uncertainty in the posterior mode
probabilities. Such uncertainty may arise when the estimator receives noisy or
incomplete measurements over an unreliable communication network. To address
this challenge, the estimation problem is formulated within a distributionally
robust framework, where the true posterior is assumed to lie within a total
variation distance ball centered at the nominal posterior. The resulting
minimax formulation yields an estimator that extends the classical MMSE
solution with additional terms that account for mode uncertainty. A tractable
implementation is developed using a distributionally robust variant of the
first-order generalized pseudo-Bayesian algorithm. A numerical example is
provided to illustrate the applicability and effectiveness of the approach.

Abstract: In the interdisciplinary field of network science, a complex-valued network,
with edges assigned complex weights, provides a more nuanced representation of
relationships by capturing both the magnitude and phase of interactions.
Additionally, an important application of this setting arises in distribution
power grids. Motivated by the richer framework, we study the necessary and
sufficient conditions for achieving consensus in both strongly and weakly
connected digraphs. The paper establishes that complex-valued Laplacian flows
converge to consensus subject to an additional constraint termed as real
dominance which relies on the phase angles of the edge weights. Our approach
builds on the complex Perron-Frobenius properties to study the spectral
properties of the Laplacian and its relation to graphical conditions. Finally,
we propose modified flows that guarantee consensus even if the original network
does not converge to consensus. Additionally, we explore diffusion in
complex-valued networks as a dual process of consensus and simulate our results
on synthetic and real-world networks.

Abstract: This brief, aimed at practitioners, offers an analysis of the effect of
sampling-time jitter, i. e., the error produced by execution-time inaccuracies.
We propose reinterpreting jitter-afflicted linear time-invariant systems
through equivalent jitter-free analogs. By constructing a perceived system that
absorbs the effects of timing perturbations into its dynamics, we find an
affine scaling of jitter. We examine both measurement and implementation
scenarios, demonstrating that the presence of jitter effectively scales the
system matrices. Moreover, we observe that, in the Laplace domain, jitter can
be interpreted as a frequency scaling.

Abstract: State estimation in control and systems engineering traditionally requires
extensive manual system identification or data-collection effort. However,
transformer-based foundation models in other domains have reduced data
requirements by leveraging pre-trained generalist models. Ultimately,
developing zero-shot foundation models of system dynamics could drastically
reduce manual deployment effort. While recent work shows that transformer-based
end-to-end approaches can achieve zero-shot performance on unseen systems, they
are limited to sensor models seen during training. We introduce the foundation
model unscented Kalman filter (FM-UKF), which combines a transformer-based
model of system dynamics with analytically known sensor models via an UKF,
enabling generalization across varying dynamics without retraining for new
sensor configurations. We evaluate FM-UKF on a new benchmark of container ship
models with complex dynamics, demonstrating a competitive accuracy, effort, and
robustness trade-off compared to classical methods with approximate system
knowledge and to an end-to-end approach. The benchmark and dataset are open
sourced to further support future research in zero-shot state estimation via
foundation models.

Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) are a powerful tool for the constrained
control of nonlinear systems; however, the majority of results in the
literature focus on systems subject to a single CBF constraint, making it
challenging to synthesize provably safe controllers that handle multiple state
constraints. This paper presents a framework for constrained control of
nonlinear systems subject to box constraints on the systems' vector-valued
outputs using multiple CBFs. Our results illustrate that when the output has a
vector relative degree, the CBF constraints encoding these box constraints are
compatible, and the resulting optimization-based controller is locally
Lipschitz continuous and admits a closed-form expression. Additional results
are presented to characterize the degradation of nominal tracking objectives in
the presence of safety constraints. Simulations of a planar quadrotor are
presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework.

Abstract: Rechargeable lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are a ubiquitous element of
modern technology. In the last decades, the production and design of such
batteries and their adjacent embedded charging and safety protocols, denoted by
Battery Management Systems (BMS), has taken central stage. A fundamental
challenge to be addressed is the trade-off between the speed of charging and
the ageing behavior, resulting in the loss of capacity in the battery cell. We
rely on a high-fidelity physics-based battery model and propose an approach to
data-driven charging and safety protocol design. Following a
Counterexample-Guided Inductive Synthesis scheme, we combine Reinforcement
Learning (RL) with recent developments in data-driven formal methods to obtain
a hybrid control strategy: RL is used to synthesise the individual controllers,
and a data-driven abstraction guides their partitioning into a switched
structure, depending on the initial output measurements of the battery. The
resulting discrete selection among RL-based controllers, coupled with the
continuous battery dynamics, realises a hybrid system. When a design meets the
desired criteria, the abstraction provides probabilistic guarantees on the
closed-loop performance of the cell.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Post-disaster crew dispatch is a critical but computationally intensive task.
Traditional mixed-integer linear programming methods often require minutes to
several hours to compute solutions, leading to delays that hinder timely
decision-making in highly dynamic restoration environments. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel learning-based framework that integrates
transformer architectures with deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to deliver
near real-time decision support without compromising solution quality. Crew
dispatch is formulated as a sequential decision-making problem under
uncertainty, where transformers capture high-dimensional system states and
temporal dependencies, while DRL enables adaptive and scalable decision-making.
Earthquake-induced distribution network damage is first characterized using
established seismic standards, followed by a scenario generation and reduction
pipeline that aggregates probable outcomes into a single geospatial impact map.
Conditioned on this map, the proposed framework generates second-level dispatch
strategies, trained offline on simulated and historical events and deployed
online for rapid response. In addition to substantial runtime improvements, the
proposed method enhances system resilience by enabling faster and more
effective recovery and restoration. Case studies, particularly on the 2869-bus
European gas and power network, demonstrate that the method substantially
accelerates restoration while maintaining high-quality solutions, underscoring
its potential for practical deployment in large-scale disaster response.

Abstract: Grid-forming voltage source converters (GFM-VSCs) are emerging as a solution
for integrating renewable energy resources (RERs) into power systems. GFM-VSCs
need a self-synchronisation strategy to ensure that all converters and
generators in the power system are in synchronism and they reach the same
frequency in steady state. The self-synchronisation strategy in GFM-VSCs that
has received most attention in previous research is virtual synchronous machine
(VSM) control. However, no systematic study of the effects on transient
stability of different variants of this strategy has been carried out in
previous work. This paper analyses and compares transient stability of four
self-synchronisation strategies for GFM-VSCs: VSM without phase-locked loop
(PLL), VSM with PLL, VSM without PLL using wash-out filter and
integral-proportional (IP) controller. The paper also analyses two different
methods that can \color{black} be applied to GFM-VSC self-synchronisation
strategies to improve transient stability: the concept of virtual unsaturated
active-power controller (VAPC), proposed in previous work, and an algorithm for
frequency limitation in the GFM-VSC (FLC), which is proposed in this paper.

Abstract: The synthesis of Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) often involves demanding
computations or a meticulous construction. However, structural properties of
the system dynamics and constraints have the potential to mitigate these
challenges. In this paper, we explore how equivariances in the dynamics,
loosely speaking a form of symmetry, can be leveraged in the CBF synthesis.
Although CBFs are generally not inherently symmetric, we show how equivariances
in the dynamics and symmetries in the constraints induce symmetries in CBFs
derived through reachability analysis. This insight allows us to infer their
CBF values across the entire domain from their values on a subset, leading to
significant computational savings. Interestingly, equivariances can be even
leveraged to the CBF synthesis for non-symmetric constraints. Specifically, we
show how a partially known CBF can be leveraged together with equivariances to
construct a CBF for various new constraints. Throughout the paper, we provide
examples illustrating the theoretical findings. Furthermore, a numerical study
investigates the computational gains from invoking equivariances into the CBF
synthesis.

Abstract: Estimating scene lighting from a single image or video remains a longstanding
challenge in computer vision and graphics. Learning-based approaches are
constrained by the scarcity of ground-truth HDR environment maps, which are
expensive to capture and limited in diversity. While recent generative models
offer strong priors for image synthesis, lighting estimation remains difficult
due to its reliance on indirect visual cues, the need to infer global
(non-local) context, and the recovery of high-dynamic-range outputs. We propose
LuxDiT, a novel data-driven approach that fine-tunes a video diffusion
transformer to generate HDR environment maps conditioned on visual input.
Trained on a large synthetic dataset with diverse lighting conditions, our
model learns to infer illumination from indirect visual cues and generalizes
effectively to real-world scenes. To improve semantic alignment between the
input and the predicted environment map, we introduce a low-rank adaptation
finetuning strategy using a collected dataset of HDR panoramas. Our method
produces accurate lighting predictions with realistic angular high-frequency
details, outperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques in both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a state-of-art technique to model real-world
scenes with high quality and real-time rendering. Typically, a higher quality
representation can be achieved by using a large number of 3D Gaussians.
However, using large 3D Gaussian counts significantly increases the GPU device
memory for storing model parameters. A large model thus requires powerful GPUs
with high memory capacities for training and has slower training/rendering
latencies due to the inefficiencies of memory access and data movement. In this
work, we introduce ContraGS, a method to enable training directly on compressed
3DGS representations without reducing the Gaussian Counts, and thus with a
little loss in model quality. ContraGS leverages codebooks to compactly store a
set of Gaussian parameter vectors throughout the training process, thereby
significantly reducing memory consumption. While codebooks have been
demonstrated to be highly effective at compressing fully trained 3DGS models,
directly training using codebook representations is an unsolved challenge.
ContraGS solves the problem of learning non-differentiable parameters in
codebook-compressed representations by posing parameter estimation as a
Bayesian inference problem. To this end, ContraGS provides a framework that
effectively uses MCMC sampling to sample over a posterior distribution of these
compressed representations. With ContraGS, we demonstrate that ContraGS
significantly reduces the peak memory during training (on average 3.49X) and
accelerated training and rendering (1.36X and 1.88X on average, respectively),
while retraining close to state-of-art quality.

Abstract: Estimating scattering parameters of heterogeneous media from images is a
severely under-constrained and challenging problem. Most of the existing
approaches model BSSRDF either through an analysis-by-synthesis approach,
approximating complex path integrals, or using differentiable volume rendering
techniques to account for heterogeneity. However, only a few studies have
applied learning-based methods to estimate subsurface scattering parameters,
but they assume homogeneous media. Interestingly, no specific distribution is
known to us that can explicitly model the heterogeneous scattering parameters
in the real world. Notably, procedural noise models such as Perlin and Fractal
Perlin noise have been effective in representing intricate heterogeneities of
natural, organic, and inorganic surfaces. Leveraging this, we first create
HeteroSynth, a synthetic dataset comprising photorealistic images of
heterogeneous media whose scattering parameters are modeled using Fractal
Perlin noise. Furthermore, we propose Tensorial Inverse Scattering (TensoIS), a
learning-based feed-forward framework to estimate these Perlin-distributed
heterogeneous scattering parameters from sparse multi-view image observations.
Instead of directly predicting the 3D scattering parameter volume, TensoIS uses
learnable low-rank tensor components to represent the scattering volume. We
evaluate TensoIS on unseen heterogeneous variations over shapes from the
HeteroSynth test set, smoke and cloud geometries obtained from open-source
realistic volumetric simulations, and some real-world samples to establish its
effectiveness for inverse scattering. Overall, this study is an attempt to
explore Perlin noise distribution, given the lack of any such well-defined
distribution in literature, to potentially model real-world heterogeneous
scattering in a feed-forward manner.

Abstract: Stylized motion generation is actively studied in computer graphics,
especially benefiting from the rapid advances in diffusion models. The goal of
this task is to produce a novel motion respecting both the motion content and
the desired motion style, e.g., ``walking in a loop like a Monkey''. Existing
research attempts to address this problem via motion style transfer or
conditional motion generation. They typically embed the motion style into a
latent space and guide the motion implicitly in a latent space as well. Despite
the progress, their methods suffer from low interpretability and control,
limited generalization to new styles, and fail to produce motions other than
``walking'' due to the strong bias in the public stylization dataset. In this
paper, we propose to solve the stylized motion generation problem from a new
perspective of reasoning-composition-generation, based on our observations: i)
human motion can often be effectively described using natural language in a
body-part centric manner, ii) LLMs exhibit a strong ability to understand and
reason about human motion, and iii) human motion has an inherently
compositional nature, facilitating the new motion content or style generation
via effective recomposing. We thus propose utilizing body-part text space as an
intermediate representation, and present SMooGPT, a fine-tuned LLM, acting as a
reasoner, composer, and generator when generating the desired stylized motion.
Our method executes in the body-part text space with much higher
interpretability, enabling fine-grained motion control, effectively resolving
potential conflicts between motion content and style, and generalizes well to
new styles thanks to the open-vocabulary ability of LLMs. Comprehensive
experiments and evaluations, and a user perceptual study, demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, especially under the pure text-driven stylized
motion generation.

Abstract: Creating human avatars is a highly desirable yet challenging task. Recent
advancements in radiance field rendering have achieved unprecedented
photorealism and real-time performance for personalized dynamic human avatars.
However, these approaches are typically limited to person-specific rendering
models trained on multi-view video data for a single individual, limiting their
ability to generalize across different identities. On the other hand,
generative approaches leveraging prior knowledge from pre-trained 2D diffusion
models can produce cartoonish, static human avatars, which are animated through
simple skeleton-based articulation. Therefore, the avatars generated by these
methods suffer from lower rendering quality compared to person-specific
rendering methods and fail to capture pose-dependent deformations such as cloth
wrinkles. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that unites the strengths
of person-specific rendering and diffusion-based generative modeling to enable
dynamic human avatar generation with both high photorealism and realistic
pose-dependent deformations. Our method follows a two-stage pipeline: first, we
optimize a set of person-specific UNets, with each network representing a
dynamic human avatar that captures intricate pose-dependent deformations. In
the second stage, we train a hyper diffusion model over the optimized network
weights. During inference, our method generates network weights for real-time,
controllable rendering of dynamic human avatars. Using a large-scale,
cross-identity, multi-view video dataset, we demonstrate that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art human avatar generation methods.

Abstract: An elastic rod is a long and thin body able to sustain large global
deformations, even if local strains are small. The Cosserat rod is a non-linear
elastic rod with an oriented centreline, which enables modelling of bending,
stretching and twisting deformations. It can be used for physically-based
computer simulation of threads, wires, ropes, as well as flexible surgical
instruments such as catheters, guidewires or sutures. We present a
massively-parallel implementation of the original CoRdE model as well as our
inextensible variation. By superseding the CUDA Scalable Programming Model and
using inter-block synchronization, we managed to simulate multiple physics
time-steps per single kernel launch utilizing all the GPU's streaming
multiprocessors. Under some constraints, this results in nearly constant
computation time, regardless of the number of Cosserat elements simulated. When
executing 10 time-steps per single kernel launch, our implementation of the
original, extensible CoRdE was x40.0 faster. In a number of tests, the GPU
implementation of our inextensible CoRdE modification achieved an average
speed-up of x15.11 over the corresponding CPU version. Simulating a
catheter/guidewire pair (2x512 Cosserat elements) in a cardiovascular
application resulted in a 13.5 fold performance boost, enabling for accurate
real-time simulation at haptic interactive rates (0.5-1kHz).

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved significant advances in a wide
range of applications. However, their deployment on resource-constrained
devices remains a challenge due to the large number of layers and parameters,
which result in considerable computational and memory demands. To address this
issue, pruning and quantization are two widely used compression techniques,
commonly applied individually in most studies to reduce model size and enhance
processing speed. Nevertheless, combining these two techniques can yield even
greater compression benefits. Effectively integrating pruning and quantization
to harness their complementary advantages poses a challenging task, primarily
due to their potential impact on model accuracy and the complexity of jointly
optimizing both processes. In this paper, we propose two approaches that
integrate similarity-based filter pruning with Adaptive Power-of-Two (APoT)
quantization to achieve higher compression efficiency while preserving model
accuracy. In the first approach, pruning and quantization are applied
simultaneously during training. In the second approach, pruning is performed
first to remove less important parameters, followed by quantization of the
pruned model using low-bit representations. Experimental results demonstrate
that our proposed approaches achieve effective model compression with minimal
accuracy degradation, making them well-suited for deployment on devices with
limited computational resources.
