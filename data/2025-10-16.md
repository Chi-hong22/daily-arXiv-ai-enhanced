### [1] [SimULi: Real-Time LiDAR and Camera Simulation with Unscented Transforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12901)
*Haithem Turki,Qi Wu,Xin Kang,Janick Martinez Esturo,Shengyu Huang,Ruilong Li,Zan Gojcic,Riccardo de Lutio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SimULi是一种能够实时渲染任意相机模型和LiDAR数据的神经渲染方法，解决了现有方法在自动驾驶测试中渲染速度慢和传感器不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经渲染方法渲染速度慢且仅支持针孔相机模型，无法满足自动驾驶测试对高失真镜头和LiDAR数据的需求，多传感器模拟存在跨传感器不一致问题。

Method: 扩展3DGUT方法，通过自动分块策略支持任意旋转LiDAR模型和基于光线的剔除，设计了分解的3D高斯表示和锚定策略来减少跨传感器不一致。

Result: 相比现有方法，相机和深度误差平均减少40%，渲染速度比光线追踪方法快10-20倍，比现有光栅化方法快1.5-10倍，在两个自动驾驶数据集上达到或超过最先进方法的保真度。

Conclusion: SimULi是首个能够实时渲染任意相机模型和LiDAR数据的方法，显著提升了自动驾驶模拟测试的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Rigorous testing of autonomous robots, such as self-driving vehicles, is
essential to ensure their safety in real-world deployments. This requires
building high-fidelity simulators to test scenarios beyond those that can be
safely or exhaustively collected in the real-world. Existing neural rendering
methods based on NeRF and 3DGS hold promise but suffer from low rendering
speeds or can only render pinhole camera models, hindering their suitability to
applications that commonly require high-distortion lenses and LiDAR data.
Multi-sensor simulation poses additional challenges as existing methods handle
cross-sensor inconsistencies by favoring the quality of one modality at the
expense of others. To overcome these limitations, we propose SimULi, the first
method capable of rendering arbitrary camera models and LiDAR data in
real-time. Our method extends 3DGUT, which natively supports complex camera
models, with LiDAR support, via an automated tiling strategy for arbitrary
spinning LiDAR models and ray-based culling. To address cross-sensor
inconsistencies, we design a factorized 3D Gaussian representation and
anchoring strategy that reduces mean camera and depth error by up to 40%
compared to existing methods. SimULi renders 10-20x faster than ray tracing
approaches and 1.5-10x faster than prior rasterization-based work (and handles
a wider range of camera models). When evaluated on two widely benchmarked
autonomous driving datasets, SimULi matches or exceeds the fidelity of existing
state-of-the-art methods across numerous camera and LiDAR metrics.

### [2] [State-Change Learning for Prediction of Future Events in Endoscopic Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12904)
*Saurav Sharma,Chinedu Innocent Nwoye,Didier Mutter,Nicolas Padoy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出SurgFUTR框架，将手术未来预测重新定义为状态变化学习，通过教师-学生架构和Action Dynamics模块实现跨手术程序的通用预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前手术AI研究主要关注理解正在发生的事件，而非预测未来事件。现有方法针对孤立任务，缺乏统一方法覆盖短期和长期预测，且依赖粗粒度监督，难以在不同手术情境和程序中泛化。

Method: 提出SurgFUTR框架，采用教师-学生架构：通过Sinkhorn-Knopp聚类将视频片段压缩为状态表示；教师网络学习当前和未来片段，学生网络仅从当前视频预测未来状态，由Action Dynamics模块指导。

Result: 在四个数据集和三个手术程序上的实验显示一致改进，跨程序迁移验证了泛化能力。建立了SFPBench基准，包含五个预测任务。

Conclusion: 将手术未来预测重新定义为状态变化学习是有效的，SurgFUTR框架在短期和长期预测任务上均表现优异，具有良好的跨程序泛化能力。

Abstract: Surgical future prediction, driven by real-time AI analysis of surgical
video, is critical for operating room safety and efficiency. It provides
actionable insights into upcoming events, their timing, and risks-enabling
better resource allocation, timely instrument readiness, and early warnings for
complications (e.g., bleeding, bile duct injury). Despite this need, current
surgical AI research focuses on understanding what is happening rather than
predicting future events. Existing methods target specific tasks in isolation,
lacking unified approaches that span both short-term (action triplets, events)
and long-term horizons (remaining surgery duration, phase transitions). These
methods rely on coarse-grained supervision while fine-grained surgical action
triplets and steps remain underexplored. Furthermore, methods based only on
future feature prediction struggle to generalize across different surgical
contexts and procedures. We address these limits by reframing surgical future
prediction as state-change learning. Rather than forecasting raw observations,
our approach classifies state transitions between current and future timesteps.
We introduce SurgFUTR, implementing this through a teacher-student
architecture. Video clips are compressed into state representations via
Sinkhorn-Knopp clustering; the teacher network learns from both current and
future clips, while the student network predicts future states from current
videos alone, guided by our Action Dynamics (ActDyn) module. We establish
SFPBench with five prediction tasks spanning short-term (triplets, events) and
long-term (remaining surgery duration, phase and step transitions) horizons.
Experiments across four datasets and three procedures show consistent
improvements. Cross-procedure transfer validates generalizability.

### [3] [Robust Plant Disease Diagnosis with Few Target-Domain Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12909)
*Takafumi Nogami,Satoshi Kagiwada,Hitoshi Iyatomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出TMPS框架，通过目标感知度量学习和优先采样，利用少量目标域样本提升植物病害诊断模型在未知环境下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习植物病害诊断系统在训练环境外图像上表现不佳，主要由于疾病症状的细微变化和领域差异，训练数据多样性不足导致模型泛化能力弱。

Method: TMPS框架基于度量学习，假设可获取少量目标域标注样本，通过目标感知的度量学习和优先采样策略有效利用这些样本。

Result: 在包含223,073张叶片图像的大规模数据集上，仅使用每疾病10个目标域样本，TMPS相比基线模型平均宏F1分数分别提升7.3和3.6个百分点，相比传统度量学习提升18.7和17.1个百分点。

Conclusion: TMPS框架能有效利用少量目标域样本显著提升植物病害诊断模型在未知环境下的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Various deep learning-based systems have been proposed for accurate and
convenient plant disease diagnosis, achieving impressive performance. However,
recent studies show that these systems often fail to maintain diagnostic
accuracy on images captured under different conditions from the training
environment -- an essential criterion for model robustness. Many deep learning
methods have shown high accuracy in plant disease diagnosis. However, they
often struggle to generalize to images taken in conditions that differ from the
training setting. This drop in performance stems from the subtle variability of
disease symptoms and domain gaps -- differences in image context and
environment. The root cause is the limited diversity of training data relative
to task complexity, making even advanced models vulnerable in unseen domains.
To tackle this challenge, we propose a simple yet highly adaptable learning
framework called Target-Aware Metric Learning with Prioritized Sampling (TMPS),
grounded in metric learning. TMPS operates under the assumption of access to a
limited number of labeled samples from the target (deployment) domain and
leverages these samples effectively to improve diagnostic robustness. We assess
TMPS on a large-scale automated plant disease diagnostic task using a dataset
comprising 223,073 leaf images sourced from 23 agricultural fields, spanning 21
diseases and healthy instances across three crop species. By incorporating just
10 target domain samples per disease into training, TMPS surpasses models
trained using the same combined source and target samples, and those fine-tuned
with these target samples after pre-training on source data. It achieves
average macro F1 score improvements of 7.3 and 3.6 points, respectively, and a
remarkable 18.7 and 17.1 point improvement over the baseline and conventional
metric learning.

*Sanghyun Byun,Jung Ick Guack,Mohanad Odema,Baisub Lee,Jacob Song,Woo Seong Chung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViZer是一个零标签增强训练框架，通过视觉-语言表示特征的对齐，使现有视觉语言模型无需文本标签或完整重训练即可生成改进的图像描述


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型依赖标注图像数据集，限制了可扩展性并导致大量未标注图像数据未被充分利用

Method: 提出统一视觉-语言对齐框架，在训练过程中主动对齐视觉和语言表示特征，实现零标签学习

Result: 在SmolVLM-Base和Qwen2-VL上应用ViZer，观察到一致的定性改进，生成的描述比基线更接地气和详细

Conclusion: ViZer为视觉语言任务中的零标签适应提供了实用起点，能够在不依赖人工或合成标注数据集的情况下提升模型性能

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve remarkable performance through
large-scale image-text pretraining. However, their reliance on labeled image
datasets limits scalability and leaves vast amounts of unlabeled image data
underutilized. To address this, we propose Unified Vision-Language Alignment
for Zero-Label Enhancement (ViZer), an enhancement training framework that
enables zero-label learning in image captioning, providing a practical starting
point for broader zero-label adaptation in vision-language tasks. Unlike prior
approaches that rely on human or synthetically annotated datasets, ViZer
actively aligns vision and language representation features during training,
enabling existing VLMs to generate improved captions without requiring text
labels or full retraining. We demonstrate ViZer's advantage in qualitative
evaluation, as automated caption metrics such as CIDEr and BERTScore often
penalize details that are absent in reference captions. Applying ViZer on
SmolVLM-Base and Qwen2-VL, we observe consistent qualitative improvements,
producing captions that are more grounded and descriptive than their baseline.

### [5] [Epistemic-aware Vision-Language Foundation Model for Fetal Ultrasound Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12953)
*Xiao He,Huangxuan Zhao,Guojia Wan,Wei Zhou,Yanxing Liu,Juhua Liu,Yongchao Xu,Yong Luo,Dacheng Tao,Bo Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FetalMind是一个专门针对胎儿超声的医疗AI系统，通过临床工作流引导的显著认知解耦方法，在报告生成和诊断任务上显著优于现有基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学视觉语言模型主要针对结构化成人影像，在胎儿超声领域表现不佳，面临多视图图像推理、多种疾病和图像多样性等挑战。

Method: 提出显著认知解耦(SED)方法，将专家构建的二部图注入模型，解耦视图-疾病关联，并通过强化学习引导临床步骤选择。同时构建了首个大规模胎儿超声报告数据集FetalSigma-1M。

Result: FetalMind在所有孕周阶段均优于开源和闭源基线模型，平均提升14%，在关键病症上的准确率提高61.2%，同时保持高效、稳定和可扩展性。

Conclusion: FetalMind通过临床工作流引导的解耦方法有效解决了胎儿超声领域的挑战，为医学AI在该领域的应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Recent medical vision-language models have shown promise on tasks such as
VQA, report generation, and anomaly detection. However, most are adapted to
structured adult imaging and underperform in fetal ultrasound, which poses
challenges of multi-view image reasoning, numerous diseases, and image
diversity. To bridge this gap, we introduce FetalMind, a medical AI system
tailored to fetal ultrasound for both report generation and diagnosis. Guided
by clinical workflow, we propose Salient Epistemic Disentanglement (SED), which
injects an expert-curated bipartite graph into the model to decouple
view-disease associations and to steer preference selection along clinically
faithful steps via reinforcement learning. This design mitigates variability
across diseases and heterogeneity across views, reducing learning bottlenecks
while aligning the model's inference with obstetric practice. To train
FetalMind at scale, we curate FetalSigma-1M dataset, the first large-scale
fetal ultrasound report corpus, comprising 20K reports from twelve medical
centers, addressing the scarcity of domain data. Extensive experiments show
that FetalMind outperforms open- and closed-source baselines across all
gestational stages, achieving +14% average gains and +61.2% higher accuracy on
critical conditions while remaining efficient, stable, and scalable. Project

rendering, we trained models that improve existing capacity limits from 100 to
500 bits, while achieving better accuracy of up to 1 failure bit out of 2000,
at 200K test bits. Finally, we achieve a comparable visual quality of 31.47 dB
PSNR and 0.13 LPIPS, showing the effectiveness of novel perceptual design in
creating multi-modal latent representations in steganography.

### [7] [CADE 2.5 - ZeResFDG: Frequency-Decoupled, Rescaled and Zero-Projected Guidance for SD/SDXL Latent Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12954)
*Denis Rychkovskiy,GPT-5*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CADE 2.5是一个用于SD/SDXL潜在扩散模型的采样器级指导堆栈，通过ZeResFDG模块统一频率解耦指导、能量重缩放和零投影，结合轻量级频谱EMA和QSilk微颗粒稳定器，在无需重新训练的情况下提升图像清晰度、提示遵循度和伪影控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散模型在采样过程中存在清晰度不足、提示遵循度差和伪影问题，需要一种无需重新训练的采样器级解决方案来提升图像质量。

Method: 核心模块ZeResFDG结合频率解耦指导、能量重缩放和零投影；使用轻量级频谱EMA在采样过程中切换保守和细节寻求模式；采用QSilk微颗粒稳定器进行推理时稳定化处理。

Result: 在SD/SDXL采样器上，该方法在中等指导尺度下显著改善了图像清晰度、提示遵循度和伪影控制，同时在高分辨率下产生自然的高频微纹理。

Conclusion: CADE 2.5提供了一种有效的采样器级指导方法，无需模型重新训练即可显著提升扩散模型的图像生成质量，具有良好的兼容性和实用性。

Abstract: We introduce CADE 2.5 (Comfy Adaptive Detail Enhancer), a sampler-level
guidance stack for SD/SDXL latent diffusion models. The central module,
ZeResFDG, unifies (i) frequency-decoupled guidance that reweights low- and
high-frequency components of the guidance signal, (ii) energy rescaling that
matches the per-sample magnitude of the guided prediction to the positive
branch, and (iii) zero-projection that removes the component parallel to the
unconditional direction. A lightweight spectral EMA with hysteresis switches
between a conservative and a detail-seeking mode as structure crystallizes
during sampling. Across SD/SDXL samplers, ZeResFDG improves sharpness, prompt
adherence, and artifact control at moderate guidance scales without any
retraining. In addition, we employ a training-free inference-time stabilizer,
QSilk Micrograin Stabilizer (quantile clamp + depth/edge-gated micro-detail
injection), which improves robustness and yields natural high-frequency
micro-texture at high resolutions with negligible overhead. For completeness we
note that the same rule is compatible with alternative parameterizations (e.g.,
velocity), which we briefly discuss in the Appendix; however, this paper
focuses on SD/SDXL latent diffusion models.

### [8] [Automated document processing system for government agencies using DBNET++ and BART models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13303)
*Aya Kaysan Bahjat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个自动文档分类系统，能够检测图像中的文本内容并将文档分类为发票、报告、信件和表格四种类型，支持离线图像和实时摄像头捕获，有效处理各种实际挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实际应用中文档图像分类面临的挑战，包括光照变化、任意方向、弯曲或部分遮挡文本、低分辨率和远距离文本等问题，实现混合来源文档的自动分类。

Method: 采用四阶段处理流程：图像采集与预处理、使用DBNet++进行文本检测、使用BART分类器进行文本分类，所有模块集成在基于PyQt5的Python用户界面中。

Result: 在Total-Text数据集上经过10小时测试，文本检测准确率达到92.88%，该数据集包含高分辨率图像模拟各种困难挑战，表明方法在非约束成像场景中具有良好效果。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法对于实际应用中混合来源文档分类在非约束成像场景中是有效的，能够处理各种实际挑战并达到较高的检测准确率。

Abstract: An automatic document classification system is presented that detects textual
content in images and classifies documents into four predefined categories
(Invoice, Report, Letter, and Form). The system supports both offline images
(e.g., files on flash drives, HDDs, microSD) and real-time capture via
connected cameras, and is designed to mitigate practical challenges such as
variable illumination, arbitrary orientation, curved or partially occluded
text, low resolution, and distant text. The pipeline comprises four stages:
image capture and preprocessing, text detection [1] using a DBNet++
(Differentiable Binarization Network Plus) detector, and text classification
[2] using a BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) classifier,
all integrated within a user interface implemented in Python with PyQt5. The
achieved results by the system for text detection in images were good at about
92.88% through 10 hours on Total-Text dataset that involve high resolution
images simulate a various and very difficult challenges. The results indicate
the proposed approach is effective for practical, mixed-source document
categorization in unconstrained imaging scenarios.

*Tianyu Zhang,Suyuchen Wang,Chao Wang,Juan Rodriguez,Ahmed Masry,Xiangru Jian,Yoshua Bengio,Perouz Taslakian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCOPE是一个混合编码器框架，通过实例级路由动态选择专用编码器，相比传统多编码器模型显著降低计算成本同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多视觉编码器VLMs简单堆叠编码器会导致收益递减且计算成本倍增，需要更智能的编码器选择机制。

Method: 提出SCOPE框架，包含共享编码器和路由编码器池，通过轻量级路由器基于文本提示和共享视觉特征的交叉注意力动态选择最优编码器，使用双熵正则化和辅助损失训练路由器。

Result: 仅使用1个共享+1个路由编码器的SCOPE模型优于同时使用4个额外编码器的模型，计算量减少24-49%。

Conclusion: 智能编码器选择优于暴力聚合方法，挑战了多编码器VLMs的主流范式。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) benefit from multiple vision encoders, but
naively stacking them yields diminishing returns while multiplying inference
costs. We propose SCOPE, a Mixture-of-Encoders (MoEnc) framework that
dynamically selects one specialized encoder per image-text pair via
instance-level routing, unlike token-level routing in traditional MoE. SCOPE
maintains a shared encoder and a pool of routed encoders. A lightweight router
uses cross-attention between text prompts and shared visual features to select
the optimal encoder from the routed encoders. To train this router, we
introduce dual entropy regularization with auxiliary losses to balance
dataset-level load distribution with instance-level routing confidence.
Remarkably, SCOPE with one shared plus one routed encoder outperforms models
using all four extra encoders simultaneously, while reducing compute by
24-49\%. This demonstrates that intelligent encoder selection beats brute-force
aggregation, challenging the prevailing paradigm in multi-encoder VLMs.

*Siddharth Tourani,Jayaram Reddy,Akash Kumbar,Satyajit Tourani,Nishant Goyal,Madhava Krishna,N. Dinesh Reddy,Muhammad Haris Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合SDF和3DGS的新方法，用于动态场景渲染和重建，无需LiDAR数据和3D运动标注即可实现最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于3DGS的动态城市场景方法需要相机和LiDAR数据、真实3D分割和运动数据，限制了应用范围。

Method: 将SDF与3DGS结合，利用深度和点跟踪等2D对象无关先验，构建统一的优化框架。

Result: 在城市场景中无需LiDAR数据即可达到最先进的渲染指标，加入LiDAR后性能进一步提升，支持场景编辑任务。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合SDF和3DGS的优势，实现了更鲁棒的对象表示和更精确的几何重建，放宽了对数据要求的限制。

Abstract: Dynamic scene rendering and reconstruction play a crucial role in computer
vision and augmented reality. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS), have enabled accurate modeling of dynamic urban scenes, but for urban
scenes they require both camera and LiDAR data, ground-truth 3D segmentations
and motion data in the form of tracklets or pre-defined object templates such
as SMPL. In this work, we explore whether a combination of 2D object agnostic
priors in the form of depth and point tracking coupled with a signed distance
function (SDF) representation for dynamic objects can be used to relax some of
these requirements. We present a novel approach that integrates Signed Distance
Functions (SDFs) with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to create a more robust
object representation by harnessing the strengths of both methods. Our unified
optimization framework enhances the geometric accuracy of 3D Gaussian splatting
and improves deformation modeling within the SDF, resulting in a more adaptable
and precise representation. We demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in rendering metrics even without LiDAR data on
urban scenes. When incorporating LiDAR, our approach improved further in
reconstructing and generating novel views across diverse object categories,
without ground-truth 3D motion annotation. Additionally, our method enables
various scene editing tasks, including scene decomposition, and scene
composition.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了时空视频动作定位(SVAG)新任务，需要同时检测、跟踪和时间定位视频中基于自然语言描述动作的所有相关对象，并构建了SVAG-Bench基准数据集和SVAGFormer基线框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要解决粗粒度动作识别或通用对象跟踪，忽视了根据动作联合检测和跟踪多个对象并对其进行时间定位的挑战。

Method: 提出SVAGFormer基线框架，适配最先进的视觉语言模型进行联合空间和时间定位，并开发SVAGEval标准化评估工具包。

Result: 实证结果显示现有模型在SVAG任务上表现不佳，特别是在密集或复杂场景中，突显了在长视频中进行细粒度对象-动作交互推理的需求。

Conclusion: SVAG任务对下一代AI系统至关重要，现有方法在此任务上的不足表明需要开发更先进的细粒度对象-动作交互推理能力。

Abstract: Understanding fine-grained actions and accurately localizing their
corresponding actors in space and time are fundamental capabilities for
advancing next-generation AI systems, including embodied agents, autonomous
platforms, and human-AI interaction frameworks. Despite recent progress in
video understanding, existing methods predominantly address either
coarse-grained action recognition or generic object tracking, thereby
overlooking the challenge of jointly detecting and tracking multiple objects
according to their actions while grounding them temporally. To address this
gap, we introduce Spatio-temporal Video Action Grounding (SVAG), a novel task
that requires models to simultaneously detect, track, and temporally localize
all referent objects in videos based on natural language descriptions of their
actions. To support this task, we construct SVAG-Bench, a large-scale benchmark
comprising 688 videos, 19,590 annotated records, and 903 unique verbs, covering
a diverse range of objects, actions, and real-world scenes. We further propose
SVAGFormer, a baseline framework that adapts state of the art vision language
models for joint spatial and temporal grounding, and introduce SVAGEval, a
standardized evaluation toolkit for fair and reproducible benchmarking.
Empirical results show that existing models perform poorly on SVAG,
particularly in dense or complex scenes, underscoring the need for more
advanced reasoning over fine-grained object-action interactions in long videos.

TL;DR: 提出了SeqBench基准测试，用于评估文本到视频生成中的序列叙事连贯性，包含320个提示和2560个人工标注视频，并设计了基于动态时序图的自动评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频生成模型在创建视觉吸引人的视频方面取得进展，但在生成需要多个事件逻辑推进的连贯序列叙事方面存在困难，且现有基准主要关注视觉质量指标而未能评估扩展序列的叙事连贯性。

Method: 构建包含320个提示的精心设计数据集，涵盖各种叙事复杂度，使用8个最先进的文本到视频模型生成2560个人工标注视频，并设计基于动态时序图的自动评估指标来高效捕捉长程依赖和时间顺序。

Result: 基于动态时序图的指标与人类标注显示出强相关性。系统评估揭示了当前文本到视频模型的关键局限性：在多动作序列中无法保持一致的物体状态、多物体场景中产生物理上不合理的结果、难以保持顺序动作之间的现实时间与排序关系。

Conclusion: SeqBench为评估文本到视频生成中的叙事连贯性提供了首个系统框架，并为改进未来模型的序列推理能力提供了具体见解。

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation models have made significant progress in
creating visually appealing videos. However, they struggle with generating
coherent sequential narratives that require logical progression through
multiple events. Existing T2V benchmarks primarily focus on visual quality
metrics but fail to evaluate narrative coherence over extended sequences. To
bridge this gap, we present SeqBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
sequential narrative coherence in T2V generation. SeqBench includes a carefully
designed dataset of 320 prompts spanning various narrative complexities, with
2,560 human-annotated videos generated from 8 state-of-the-art T2V models.
Additionally, we design a Dynamic Temporal Graphs (DTG)-based automatic
evaluation metric, which can efficiently capture long-range dependencies and
temporal ordering while maintaining computational efficiency. Our DTG-based
metric demonstrates a strong correlation with human annotations. Through
systematic evaluation using SeqBench, we reveal critical limitations in current
T2V models: failure to maintain consistent object states across multi-action
sequences, physically implausible results in multi-object scenarios, and
difficulties in preserving realistic timing and ordering relationships between
sequential actions. SeqBench provides the first systematic framework for
evaluating narrative coherence in T2V generation and offers concrete insights
for improving sequential reasoning capabilities in future models. Please refer

TL;DR: SceneAdapt框架通过两个适应阶段（中间帧生成和场景感知中间帧生成），利用分离的场景-运动和文本-运动数据集，将场景感知能力注入到文本条件运动模型中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有运动生成方法要么关注运动语义，要么关注场景感知，但缺乏同时处理两者的能力。构建同时包含丰富文本-运动覆盖和精确场景交互的大规模数据集极具挑战性。

Method: 使用运动中间帧生成作为代理任务来桥接两个不同的数据集。第一阶段引入关键帧层来调制运动潜在表示；第二阶段添加场景条件层，通过交叉注意力自适应查询局部上下文来注入场景几何信息。

Result: 实验结果表明SceneAdapt有效地将场景感知能力注入到文本到运动模型中，并分析了这种感知能力出现的机制。

Conclusion: SceneAdapt框架成功解决了在缺乏大规模联合数据集的情况下，为文本条件运动模型注入场景感知能力的问题。

Abstract: Human motion is inherently diverse and semantically rich, while also shaped
by the surrounding scene. However, existing motion generation approaches
address either motion semantics or scene-awareness in isolation, since
constructing large-scale datasets with both rich text--motion coverage and
precise scene interactions is extremely challenging. In this work, we introduce
SceneAdapt, a framework that injects scene awareness into text-conditioned
motion models by leveraging disjoint scene--motion and text--motion datasets
through two adaptation stages: inbetweening and scene-aware inbetweening. The
key idea is to use motion inbetweening, learnable without text, as a proxy task
to bridge two distinct datasets and thereby inject scene-awareness to
text-to-motion models. In the first stage, we introduce keyframing layers that
modulate motion latents for inbetweening while preserving the latent manifold.
In the second stage, we add a scene-conditioning layer that injects scene
geometry by adaptively querying local context through cross-attention.
Experimental results show that SceneAdapt effectively injects scene awareness
into text-to-motion models, and we further analyze the mechanisms through which
this awareness emerges. Code and models will be released.

*Huawei Jiang,Husna Mutahira,Gan Huang,Mannan Saeed Muhammad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合卷积神经网络和Mamba状态空间模型的混合框架1D-CNN-ECG-Mamba，用于心电图异常检测，在PhysioNet 2020和2021挑战赛上取得了优于现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习模型在处理长序列心电图信号时性能有限，而状态空间模型提供了更高效的替代方案。

Method: 使用卷积特征提取结合Mamba选择性状态空间模型，基于Vision Mamba双向变体增强心电图数据中时间依赖关系的表示。

Result: 在12导联心电图上获得了显著高于先前最佳算法的AUPRC和AUROC分数。

Conclusion: 基于Mamba的架构有潜力推进可靠的心电图分类，支持早期诊断和个性化治疗，同时提高远程医疗和资源受限医疗系统的可及性。

Abstract: Accurate detection of cardiac abnormalities from electrocardiogram recordings
is regarded as essential for clinical diagnostics and decision support.
Traditional deep learning models such as residual networks and transformer
architectures have been applied successfully to this task, but their
performance has been limited when long sequential signals are processed.
Recently, state space models have been introduced as an efficient alternative.
In this study, a hybrid framework named One Dimensional Convolutional Neural
Network Electrocardiogram Mamba is introduced, in which convolutional feature
extraction is combined with Mamba, a selective state space model designed for
effective sequence modeling. The model is built upon Vision Mamba, a
bidirectional variant through which the representation of temporal dependencies
in electrocardiogram data is enhanced. Comprehensive experiments on the
PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenges of 2020 and 2021 were conducted,
and superior performance compared with existing methods was achieved.
Specifically, the proposed model achieved substantially higher AUPRC and AUROC
scores than those reported by the best previously published algorithms on
twelve lead electrocardiograms. These results demonstrate the potential of
Mamba-based architectures to advance reliable ECG classification. This
capability supports early diagnosis and personalized treatment, while enhancing
accessibility in telemedicine and resource-constrained healthcare systems.

### [15] [True Self-Supervised Novel View Synthesis is Transferable](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13063)
*Thomas W. Mitchel,Hyunwoo Ryu,Vincent Sitzmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XFactor是第一个无需几何先验、能够实现真正新颖视图合成的自监督模型，通过成对姿态估计和输入输出增强方案，成功解耦相机姿态与场景内容，实现姿态的可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督NVS方法预测的姿态缺乏可迁移性，相同的姿态集在不同3D场景中会产生不同的相机轨迹，无法实现真正的新颖视图合成。

Method: 结合成对姿态估计与输入输出增强方案，无需3D归纳偏置或多视图几何概念，使用无约束的潜在姿态变量实现姿态解耦。

Result: XFactor显著优于先前的无姿态NVS变换器，潜在姿态与现实世界姿态高度相关，实现了真正的姿态可迁移性。

Conclusion: XFactor证明了无需显式几何表示即可实现真正的新颖视图合成，为自监督3D场景理解提供了新方向。

Abstract: In this paper, we identify that the key criterion for determining whether a
model is truly capable of novel view synthesis (NVS) is transferability:
Whether any pose representation extracted from one video sequence can be used
to re-render the same camera trajectory in another. We analyze prior work on
self-supervised NVS and find that their predicted poses do not transfer: The
same set of poses lead to different camera trajectories in different 3D scenes.
Here, we present XFactor, the first geometry-free self-supervised model capable
of true NVS. XFactor combines pair-wise pose estimation with a simple
augmentation scheme of the inputs and outputs that jointly enables
disentangling camera pose from scene content and facilitates geometric
reasoning. Remarkably, we show that XFactor achieves transferability with
unconstrained latent pose variables, without any 3D inductive biases or
concepts from multi-view geometry -- such as an explicit parameterization of
poses as elements of SE(3). We introduce a new metric to quantify
transferability, and through large-scale experiments, we demonstrate that
XFactor significantly outperforms prior pose-free NVS transformers, and show
that latent poses are highly correlated with real-world poses through probing
experiments.

*Kaixuan Yang,Wei Xiang,Zhenshuai Chen,Tong Jin,Yunpeng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种方向感知的多尺度梯度损失函数，用于红外与可见光图像融合，通过分别监督水平和垂直梯度分量并保留其符号，提升边缘清晰度和纹理保留效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的方法在训练时使用梯度幅值损失，但将梯度压缩为幅值会丢失方向信息，导致模糊的监督信号和次优的边缘保真度。

Method: 引入方向感知的多尺度梯度损失，分别监督水平和垂直梯度分量，并在不同尺度上保留其符号，提供清晰的方向指导。

Result: 在开源模型和多个公共基准测试上的实验表明，该方法能有效提升边缘清晰度、对齐效果和纹理保留，且无需改变模型架构或训练协议。

Conclusion: 方向感知的多尺度梯度损失为图像融合提供了更好的监督信号，显著改善了融合质量。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion aims to integrate complementary information
from co-registered source images to produce a single, informative result. Most
learning-based approaches train with a combination of structural similarity
loss, intensity reconstruction loss, and a gradient-magnitude term. However,
collapsing gradients to their magnitude removes directional information,
yielding ambiguous supervision and suboptimal edge fidelity. We introduce a
direction-aware, multi-scale gradient loss that supervises horizontal and
vertical components separately and preserves their sign across scales. This
axis-wise, sign-preserving objective provides clear directional guidance at
both fine and coarse resolutions, promoting sharper, better-aligned edges and
richer texture preservation without changing model architectures or training
protocols. Experiments on open-source model and multiple public benchmarks
demonstrate effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于医学图像分割的无监督域自适应框架，通过结合z-归一化风格协调和双向可变形图像配准来解决跨域海马体分割中的风格和内容域偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在跨数据集部署时因域偏移（风格和内容变化）而性能下降，特别是在从健康人群到痴呆患者的跨域海马体分割中。

Method: 结合z-归一化风格协调与双向可变形图像配准(DIR)策略，DIR网络与分割和判别器网络联合训练，生成解剖学上合理的变换以对齐源图像到目标域。

Result: 在合成数据集和三个MRI海马体数据集上的综合评估显示，该方法优于现有基线。从健康人群到痴呆患者的迁移中，Dice得分相对标准增强方法提升高达15%，在内容偏移大的场景中增益最大。

Conclusion: 该方法在跨不同人群的准确海马体分割中表现出高效性，特别适用于处理显著的域内容偏移。

Abstract: Deep learning models for medical image segmentation often struggle when
deployed across different datasets due to domain shifts - variations in both
image appearance, known as style, and population-dependent anatomical
characteristics, referred to as content. This paper presents a novel
unsupervised domain adaptation framework that directly addresses domain shifts
encountered in cross-domain hippocampus segmentation from MRI, with specific
emphasis on content variations. Our approach combines efficient style
harmonisation through z-normalisation with a bidirectional deformable image
registration (DIR) strategy. The DIR network is jointly trained with
segmentation and discriminator networks to guide the registration with respect
to a region of interest and generate anatomically plausible transformations
that align source images to the target domain. We validate our approach through
comprehensive evaluations on both a synthetic dataset using Morpho-MNIST (for
controlled validation of core principles) and three MRI hippocampus datasets
representing populations with varying degrees of atrophy. Across all
experiments, our method outperforms existing baselines. For hippocampus
segmentation, when transferring from young, healthy populations to clinical
dementia patients, our framework achieves up to 15% relative improvement in
Dice score compared to standard augmentation methods, with the largest gains
observed in scenarios with substantial content shift. These results highlight
the efficacy of our approach for accurate hippocampus segmentation across
diverse populations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了计数幻觉的概念，构建了CountHalluSet数据集，开发了标准化评估协议来量化扩散模型中的计数幻觉现象，并分析了采样条件与常见评估指标的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散概率模型在生成任务中表现出色，但经常产生与现实知识冲突的幻觉样本，特别是计数错误问题。目前缺乏系统量化这种幻觉的方法，阻碍了解决这一挑战的进展。

Method: 构建包含ToyShape、SimObject和RealHand的CountHalluSet数据集，建立标准化评估协议，系统研究不同采样条件（求解器类型、ODE求解器阶数、采样步数、初始噪声）对计数幻觉的影响。

Result: 发现FID等常用图像质量指标无法一致地捕捉计数幻觉，不同采样条件对计数幻觉水平有显著影响。

Conclusion: 这是系统量化扩散模型中幻觉现象的第一步，为研究图像生成中的幻觉现象提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress
in generative tasks, such as image and video synthesis. However, they still
often produce hallucinated samples (hallucinations) that conflict with
real-world knowledge, such as generating an implausible duplicate cup floating
beside another cup. Despite their prevalence, the lack of feasible
methodologies for systematically quantifying such hallucinations hinders
progress in addressing this challenge and obscures potential pathways for
designing next-generation generative models under factual constraints. In this
work, we bridge this gap by focusing on a specific form of hallucination, which
we term counting hallucination, referring to the generation of an incorrect
number of instances or structured objects, such as a hand image with six
fingers, despite such patterns being absent from the training data. To this
end, we construct a dataset suite CountHalluSet, with well-defined counting
criteria, comprising ToyShape, SimObject, and RealHand. Using these datasets,
we develop a standardized evaluation protocol for quantifying counting
hallucinations, and systematically examine how different sampling conditions in
DPMs, including solver type, ODE solver order, sampling steps, and initial
noise, affect counting hallucination levels. Furthermore, we analyze their
correlation with common evaluation metrics such as FID, revealing that this
widely used image quality metric fails to capture counting hallucinations
consistently. This work aims to take the first step toward systematically
quantifying hallucinations in diffusion models and offer new insights into the
investigation of hallucination phenomena in image generation.

TL;DR: Edit-Your-Interest是一个轻量级、文本驱动的零样本视频编辑方法，通过时空特征记忆库和特征传播机制，在降低计算开销的同时保持时间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法存在计算开销大、内存消耗高的问题，且常常牺牲视觉保真度，导致时间不一致性和伪影。

Method: 引入时空特征记忆库(SFM)缓存特征，提出特征最相似传播(FMP)方法传播相关token，使用SFM更新算法持续刷新缓存特征，并利用交叉注意力图自动提取目标实例掩码。

Result: 实验表明Edit-Your-Interest在效率和视觉保真度方面优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持时间一致性和背景完整性的同时，实现了高效准确的视频编辑。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have recently demonstrated significant
progress in video editing.
  However, existing video editing methods are severely limited by their high
computational overhead and memory consumption.
  Furthermore, these approaches often sacrifice visual fidelity, leading to
undesirable temporal inconsistencies and artifacts such as blurring and
pronounced mosaic-like patterns.
  We propose Edit-Your-Interest, a lightweight, text-driven, zero-shot video
editing method.
  Edit-Your-Interest introduces a spatio-temporal feature memory to cache
features from previous frames, significantly reducing computational overhead
compared to full-sequence spatio-temporal modeling approaches.
  Specifically, we first introduce a Spatio-Temporal Feature Memory bank (SFM),
which is designed to efficiently cache and retain the crucial image tokens
processed by spatial attention.
  Second, we propose the Feature Most-Similar Propagation (FMP) method. FMP
propagates the most relevant tokens from previous frames to subsequent ones,
preserving temporal consistency.
  Finally, we introduce an SFM update algorithm that continuously refreshes the
cached features, ensuring their long-term relevance and effectiveness
throughout the video sequence.
  Furthermore, we leverage cross-attention maps to automatically extract masks
for the instances of interest.
  These masks are seamlessly integrated into the diffusion denoising process,
enabling fine-grained control over target objects and allowing
Edit-Your-Interest to perform highly accurate edits while robustly preserving
the background integrity.
  Extensive experiments decisively demonstrate that the proposed
Edit-Your-Interest outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and
visual fidelity, validating its superior effectiveness and practicality.

*Xijun Wang,Tanay Sharma,Achin Kulshrestha,Abhimitra Meka,Aveek Purohit,Dinesh Manocha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了EgoSocial数据集和EgoSoD方法，用于解决AR/VR环境中AI助手缺乏社交感知能力的问题，显著提升了干预时机检测和社交交互理解的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AR/VR技术融入日常生活，需要能够从第一人称视角理解人类社交动态的AI。当前LLMs缺乏社交意识，无法判断何时作为AI助手进行干预，导致频繁且不合时宜的响应，干扰自然对话并影响用户专注度。

Method: 1) 构建EgoSocial大规模第一人称数据集（13,500个社交视频-问题对）；2) 提出EgoSoD端到端方法，整合多模态上下文线索（音频和视觉）到社交思维图中，动态建模参与者和交互；3) 主动检测干预时机和社交交互。

Result: 实验显示：1) 现有OLLMs在检测干预时机方面表现不佳（Gemini 2.5 Pro仅14.4%）；2) EgoSoD显著提升性能：在干预时机检测上，Phi-4提升45.6%，Gemini 2.5 Pro提升9.9%；在整体社交交互性能上，Phi-4提升20.4%，Gemini 2.5 Pro提升6.9%。

Conclusion: EgoSoD方法通过整合多模态线索和动态社交建模，有效解决了AI助手在社交交互中的干预时机判断问题，为AR/VR环境中的社交感知AI提供了重要进展。

Abstract: As AR/VR technologies become integral to daily life, there's a growing need
for AI that understands human social dynamics from an egocentric perspective.
However, current LLMs often lack the social awareness to discern when to
intervene as AI assistant. This leads to constant, socially unaware responses
that may disrupt natural conversation and negatively impact user focus. To
address these limitations, we introduce EgoSocial, a large-scale egocentric
dataset with 13,500 social video-question pairs, specifically designed to
benchmark intervention in social interaction perception. We also present an
in-depth analysis of current omnimodal LLMs (OLLMs) to assess their
effectiveness in detecting diverse social contextual cues. Experiments show
that OLLMs still struggle to detect the intervention timing (14.4% for Gemini
2.5 Pro). We also propose EgoSoD (EgoSocial Detection), an end-to-end method
for robustly discerning social dynamics. Informed by our OLLM analysis, EgoSoD
integrates multimodal contextual cues (e.g., audio and visual cues) into a
social thinking graph, dynamically modeling participants and interactions. Our
method proactively detects intervention timing and social interactions,
precisely determining when to intervene. Our EgoSoD improves Phi-4 by 45.6% and
Gemini 2.5 Pro by 9.9% on Intervention Timing performance, and improves Phi-4
by 20.4% and Gemini 2.5 Pro by 6.9% on overall Social Interaction performance.
We will release the dataset and code soon.

Motivation: 现有自动驾驶规划器评估指标（如EPDMS）在复杂场景中缺乏上下文感知能力，无法与人类判断很好对齐。

Method: 1) 构建DriveCritic数据集，包含需要上下文理解才能正确判断的挑战性场景，并标注人类偏好；2) 开发DriveCritic模型，基于视觉语言模型，通过两阶段监督学习和强化学习训练，整合视觉和符号上下文来评估轨迹对。

Result: 实验表明DriveCritic在匹配人类偏好方面显著优于现有指标和基线方法，并展现出强大的上下文感知能力。

Conclusion: 该工作为评估自动驾驶系统提供了更可靠、与人类对齐的基础框架。

Abstract: Benchmarking autonomous driving planners to align with human judgment remains
a critical challenge, as state-of-the-art metrics like the Extended Predictive
Driver Model Score (EPDMS) lack context awareness in nuanced scenarios. To
address this, we introduce DriveCritic, a novel framework featuring two key
contributions: the DriveCritic dataset, a curated collection of challenging
scenarios where context is critical for correct judgment and annotated with
pairwise human preferences, and the DriveCritic model, a Vision-Language Model
(VLM) based evaluator. Fine-tuned using a two-stage supervised and
reinforcement learning pipeline, the DriveCritic model learns to adjudicate
between trajectory pairs by integrating visual and symbolic context.
Experiments show DriveCritic significantly outperforms existing metrics and
baselines in matching human preferences and demonstrates strong context
awareness. Overall, our work provides a more reliable, human-aligned foundation
to evaluating autonomous driving systems.

Result: 在OASIS-1数据集的150个脑部扫描配准中，VPreg在35个感兴趣区域的Dice分数、计算变换的规则性、逆映射的准确性和一致性方面均优于ANTs-SyN、Freesurfer-Easyreg和FSL-Fnirt等最先进方法。

Conclusion: VPreg通过变分原理方法实现了优异的配准性能，在保持微分同胚变换特性的同时提供了更准确的逆变换，为计算解剖学和形态测量学提供了可靠的工具。

Abstract: This paper introduces VPreg, a novel diffeomorphic image registration method.
This work provides several improvements to our past work on mesh generation and
diffeomorphic image registration. VPreg aims to achieve excellent registration
accuracy while controlling the quality of the registration transformations. It
ensures a positive Jacobian determinant of the spatial transformation and
provides an accurate approximation of the inverse of the registration, a
crucial property for many neuroimaging workflows. Unlike conventional methods,
VPreg generates this inverse transformation within the group of diffeomorphisms
rather than operating on the image space. The core of VPreg is a grid
generation approach, referred to as \emph{Variational Principle} (VP), which
constructs non-folding grids with prescribed Jacobian determinant and curl.
These VP-generated grids guarantee diffeomorphic spatial transformations
essential for computational anatomy and morphometry, and provide a more
accurate inverse than existing methods. To assess the potential of the proposed
approach, we conduct a performance analysis for 150 registrations of brain
scans from the OASIS-1 dataset. Performance evaluation based on Dice scores for
35 regions of interest, along with an empirical analysis of the properties of
the computed spatial transformations, demonstrates that VPreg outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of Dice scores, regularity properties of the
computed transformation, and accuracy and consistency of the provided inverse
map. We compare our results to ANTs-SyN, Freesurfer-Easyreg, and FSL-Fnirt.

Motivation: 解决文本-图像对齐中因信息熵差异导致的跨模态检索不平衡问题，传统方法在两种模态的相互检索中存在失衡。

Method: 1) 设计不依赖任务域显式知识的提示模板，利用LLM增强文本模态的多义性描述；2) 使用超图适配器构建文本与图像模态间的多边连接，在固定嵌入空间中校正同义语义的正负匹配误差。

Result: 在Flickr30K和MS-COCO基准测试中，文本到图像检索提升16.8%，图像到文本检索提升40.1%，在语义对齐任务中达到新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: 通过LLM增强文本信息熵和超图适配器优化跨模态连接，有效解决了文本-图像对齐中的信息熵不平衡问题，显著提升了跨模态检索性能。

Abstract: Text-image alignment constitutes a foundational challenge in multimedia
content understanding, where effective modeling of cross-modal semantic
correspondences critically enhances retrieval system performance through joint
embedding space optimization. Given the inherent difference in information
entropy between texts and images, conventional approaches often show an
imbalance in the mutual retrieval of these two modalities. To address this
particular challenge, we propose to use the open semantic knowledge of Large
Language Model (LLM) to fill for the entropy gap and reproduce the alignment
ability of humans in these tasks. Our entropy-enhancing alignment is achieved
through a two-step process: 1) a new prompt template that does not rely on
explicit knowledge in the task domain is designed to use LLM to enhance the
polysemy description of the text modality. By analogy, the information entropy
of the text modality relative to the visual modality is increased; 2) A
hypergraph adapter is used to construct multilateral connections between the
text and image modalities, which can correct the positive and negative matching
errors for synonymous semantics in the same fixed embedding space, whilst
reducing the noise caused by open semantic entropy by mapping the reduced
dimensions back to the original dimensions. Comprehensive evaluations on the
Flickr30K and MS-COCO benchmarks validate the superiority of our Open Semantic
Hypergraph Adapter (OS-HGAdapter), showcasing 16.8\% (text-to-image) and 40.1\%
(image-to-text) cross-modal retrieval gains over existing methods while
establishing new state-of-the-art performance in semantic alignment tasks.

Abstract: This study investigates the performance of 3D Convolutional Neural Networks
(3D CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for real-time American
Sign Language (ASL) recognition. Though 3D CNNs are good at spatiotemporal
feature extraction from video sequences, LSTMs are optimized for modeling
temporal dependencies in sequential data. We evaluate both architectures on a
dataset containing 1,200 ASL signs across 50 classes, comparing their accuracy,
computational efficiency, and latency under similar training conditions.
Experimental results demonstrate that 3D CNNs achieve 92.4% recognition
accuracy but require 3.2% more processing time per frame compared to LSTMs,
which maintain 86.7% accuracy with significantly lower resource consumption.
The hybrid 3D CNNLSTM model shows decent performance, which suggests that

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法大多在模拟或单一真实场景数据上训练，忽略了不同地理区域噪声特性的显著差异，导致模型在新环境中性能下降。

Method: 利用TEM信号固有的物理特性（指数衰减和平滑性）作为先验知识，通过字典学习编码这些特性，在训练时集成到DTEMDNet网络中，测试时通过最小化字典驱动一致性和信号一阶变分的自监督损失来动态适应新环境。

Conclusion: 提出的DP-TTA方法通过利用TEM信号的固有物理特性作为先验知识，有效提升了模型在新地理环境中的去噪性能，解决了跨区域适应性不足的问题。

Abstract: Transient Electromagnetic (TEM) method is widely used in various geophysical
applications, providing valuable insights into subsurface properties. However,
time-domain TEM signals are often submerged in various types of noise. While
recent deep learning-based denoising models have shown strong performance,
these models are mostly trained on simulated or single real-world scenario
data, overlooking the significant differences in noise characteristics from
different geographical regions. Intuitively, models trained in one environment
often struggle to perform well in new settings due to differences in geological
conditions, equipment, and external interference, leading to reduced denoising
performance. To this end, we propose the Dictionary-driven Prior Regularization
Test-time Adaptation (DP-TTA). Our key insight is that TEM signals possess
intrinsic physical characteristics, such as exponential decay and smoothness,
which remain consistent across different regions regardless of external
conditions. These intrinsic characteristics serve as ideal prior knowledge for
guiding the TTA strategy, which helps the pre-trained model dynamically adjust
parameters by utilizing self-supervised losses, improving denoising performance
in new scenarios. To implement this, we customized a network, named DTEMDNet.
Specifically, we first use dictionary learning to encode these intrinsic
characteristics as a dictionary-driven prior, which is integrated into the
model during training. At the testing stage, this prior guides the model to
adapt dynamically to new environments by minimizing self-supervised losses
derived from the dictionary-driven consistency and the signal one-order
variation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves much better performance than existing TEM denoising methods and TTA
methods.

Motivation: 传统边缘资源管理方法强调通信吞吐量或通用学习性能，但EGS明确旨在最大化高斯泼溅质量，现有方法不适用。需要解决评估目标函数时面临的因果困境。

Method: 提出STT-GS策略：首先从每个客户端采样图像作为导频数据进行损失预测，然后基于评估结果优先分配通信资源给更有价值的客户端。使用特征域聚类选择代表性数据，采用导频传输时间最小化减少开销。开发了联合客户端选择和功率控制框架，基于惩罚交替主化最小化算法求解非凸问题。

Result: 在真实数据集上显著优于现有基准方法。发现面向高斯泼溅的目标函数可以在低采样率(如10%)下准确预测，方法在视图贡献和通信成本之间实现了良好平衡。

Conclusion: 提出的方案有效解决了EGS中的资源分配问题，通过两阶段采样和传输策略，在保证重建质量的同时优化了通信效率。

Abstract: Edge Gaussian splatting (EGS), which aggregates data from distributed clients
and trains a global GS model at the edge server, is an emerging paradigm for
scene reconstruction. Unlike traditional edge resource management methods that
emphasize communication throughput or general-purpose learning performance, EGS
explicitly aims to maximize the GS qualities, rendering existing approaches
inapplicable. To address this problem, this paper formulates a novel
GS-oriented objective function that distinguishes the heterogeneous view
contributions of different clients. However, evaluating this function in turn
requires clients' images, leading to a causality dilemma. To this end, this
paper further proposes a sample-then-transmit EGS (or STT-GS for short)
strategy, which first samples a subset of images as pilot data from each client
for loss prediction. Based on the first-stage evaluation, communication
resources are then prioritized towards more valuable clients. To achieve
efficient sampling, a feature-domain clustering (FDC) scheme is proposed to
select the most representative data and pilot transmission time minimization
(PTTM) is adopted to reduce the pilot overhead.Subsequently, we develop a joint
client selection and power control (JCSPC) framework to maximize the
GS-oriented function under communication resource constraints. Despite the
nonconvexity of the problem, we propose a low-complexity efficient solution
based on the penalty alternating majorization minimization (PAMM) algorithm.
Experiments unveil that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms existing
benchmarks on real-world datasets. It is found that the GS-oriented objective
can be accurately predicted with low sampling ratios (e.g.,10%), and our method
achieves an excellent tradeoff between view contributions and communication
costs.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注结构改进，很少从表示融合角度探索，导致2D图像中丰富的特征多样性未被充分利用。

Method: 提出两阶段占用预测框架，提取分割、图形和深度特征，采用可变形多级融合机制融合这些多级特征，并引入SAM知识蒸馏。

Result: 在不增加训练成本的情况下，在SemanticKITTI基准上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: CIGOcc通过有效的多级表示融合和知识蒸馏，显著提升了基于相机的3D占用预测性能。

Abstract: Camera-based occupancy prediction is a mainstream approach for 3D perception
in autonomous driving, aiming to infer complete 3D scene geometry and semantics
from 2D images. Almost existing methods focus on improving performance through
structural modifications, such as lightweight backbones and complex cascaded
frameworks, with good yet limited performance. Few studies explore from the
perspective of representation fusion, leaving the rich diversity of features in
2D images underutilized. Motivated by this, we propose \textbf{CIGOcc, a
two-stage occupancy prediction framework based on multi-level representation
fusion. \textbf{CIGOcc extracts segmentation, graphics, and depth features from
an input image and introduces a deformable multi-level fusion mechanism to fuse
these three multi-level features. Additionally, CIGOcc incorporates knowledge
distilled from SAM to further enhance prediction accuracy. Without increasing
training costs, CIGOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
SemanticKITTI benchmark. The code is provided in the supplementary material and
will be released https://github.com/VitaLemonTea1/CIGOcc

Abstract: The rapid growth of AI conferences is straining an already fragile
peer-review system, leading to heavy reviewer workloads, expertise mismatches,
inconsistent evaluation standards, superficial or templated reviews, and
limited accountability under compressed timelines. In response, conference
organizers have introduced new policies and interventions to preserve review
standards. Yet these ad-hoc changes often create further concerns and confusion
about the review process, leaving how papers are ultimately accepted - and how
practices evolve across years - largely opaque. We present Paper Copilot, a
system that creates durable digital archives of peer reviews across a wide
range of computer-science venues, an open dataset that enables researchers to
study peer review at scale, and a large-scale empirical analysis of ICLR
reviews spanning multiple years. By releasing both the infrastructure and the
dataset, Paper Copilot supports reproducible research on the evolution of peer
review. We hope these resources help the community track changes, diagnose
failure modes, and inform evidence-based improvements toward a more robust,
transparent, and reliable peer-review system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在从语音生成风格化3D人体运动时，要么过度简化风格多样性，要么忽略区域运动风格差异（如上身与下身），且未能动态适应语音节奏和情感变化，限制了运动真实感。

Method: 将身体划分为不同区域来编码局部运动风格，使用分区感知风格注入和分区感知去噪网络，通过分区感知注意力块让节奏和情感线索精确指导每个身体区域。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法优于现有方法，生成了更自然和富有表现力的3D人体运动序列。

Conclusion: MimicParts框架通过分区感知方法有效解决了风格化3D人体运动生成中的区域风格差异和动态适应问题，显著提升了运动真实感和表现力。

Abstract: Generating stylized 3D human motion from speech signals presents substantial
challenges, primarily due to the intricate and fine-grained relationships among
speech signals, individual styles, and the corresponding body movements.
Current style encoding approaches either oversimplify stylistic diversity or
ignore regional motion style differences (e.g., upper vs. lower body), limiting
motion realism. Additionally, motion style should dynamically adapt to changes
in speech rhythm and emotion, but existing methods often overlook this. To
address these issues, we propose MimicParts, a novel framework designed to
enhance stylized motion generation based on part-aware style injection and
part-aware denoising network. It divides the body into different regions to
encode localized motion styles, enabling the model to capture fine-grained
regional differences. Furthermore, our part-aware attention block allows rhythm
and emotion cues to guide each body region precisely, ensuring that the
generated motion aligns with variations in speech rhythm and emotional state.
Experimental results show that our method outperforming existing methods
showcasing naturalness and expressive 3D human motion sequences.

Motivation: 当前研究中VP和VPT概念边界模糊，经常被互换使用，缺乏对这些技术及其应用的系统性区分。

Method: 从第一性原理重新审视VP和VPT设计，将其概念化为统一的提示式适应(PA)框架，提供可学习、生成式和非学习式提示的分类体系，并按注入粒度组织。

Result: 建立了PA的综合分类框架，涵盖了像素级和令牌级注入方法，并考察了PA在医学影像、3D点云、视觉语言任务等多个领域的应用。

Conclusion: 这是首个专门针对PA方法论和应用的全面综述，为研究人员和从业者提供了清晰的研究路线图，帮助理解PA相关研究的演变格局。

Abstract: In computer vision, Visual Prompting (VP) and Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) have
recently emerged as lightweight and effective alternatives to full fine-tuning
for adapting large-scale vision models within the ``pretrain-then-finetune''
paradigm. However, despite rapid progress, their conceptual boundaries remain
blurred, as VP and VPT are frequently used interchangeably in current research,
reflecting a lack of systematic distinction between these techniques and their
respective applications. In this survey, we revisit the designs of VP and VPT
from first principles, and conceptualize them within a unified framework termed
Prompt-based Adaptation (PA). We provide a taxonomy that categorizes existing
methods into learnable, generative, and non-learnable prompts, and further
organizes them by injection granularity -- pixel-level and token-level. Beyond
the core methodologies, we examine PA's integrations across diverse domains,
including medical imaging, 3D point clouds, and vision-language tasks, as well
as its role in test-time adaptation and trustworthy AI. We also summarize
current benchmarks and identify key challenges and future directions. To the
best of our knowledge, we are the first comprehensive survey dedicated to PA's
methodologies and applications in light of their distinct characteristics. Our
survey aims to provide a clear roadmap for researchers and practitioners in all
area to understand and explore the evolving landscape of PA-related research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业表面缺陷检测面临极度的前景-背景不平衡、缺陷稀疏性、长尾尺度分布和低对比度等挑战，现有模型在像素重叠指标上表现良好但在样本级决策稳定性不足，特别是对于稀疏或细长缺陷。

Method: 基于共享编码器架构，联合学习样本级缺陷分类和像素级掩码定位，通过样本级监督调制特征分布，在梯度层面持续提升对小尺寸和低对比度缺陷的召回率。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提高了样本级决策的可靠性和缺陷定位的完整性。

Conclusion: 样本中心的多任务学习框架有效解决了工业缺陷检测中像素中心方法的局限性，通过决策关联指标Seg_mIoU和Seg_Recall更好地评估模型性能。

Abstract: Industrial surface defect inspection for sample-wise quality control (QC)
must simultaneously decide whether a given sample contains defects and localize
those defects spatially. In real production lines, extreme
foreground-background imbalance, defect sparsity with a long-tailed scale
distribution, and low contrast are common. As a result, pixel-centric training
and evaluation are easily dominated by large homogeneous regions, making it
difficult to drive models to attend to small or low-contrast defects-one of the
main bottlenecks for deployment. Empirically, existing models achieve strong
pixel-overlap metrics (e.g., mIoU) but exhibit insufficient stability at the
sample level, especially for sparse or slender defects. The root cause is a
mismatch between the optimization objective and the granularity of QC
decisions. To address this, we propose a sample-centric multi-task learning
framework and evaluation suite. Built on a shared-encoder architecture, the
method jointly learns sample-level defect classification and pixel-level mask
localization. Sample-level supervision modulates the feature distribution and,
at the gradient level, continually boosts recall for small and low-contrast
defects, while the segmentation branch preserves boundary and shape details to
enhance per-sample decision stability and reduce misses. For evaluation, we
propose decision-linked metrics, Seg_mIoU and Seg_Recall, which remove the bias
of classical mIoU caused by empty or true-negative samples and tightly couple
localization quality with sample-level decisions. Experiments on two benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our approach substantially improves the reliability
of sample-level decisions and the completeness of defect localization.

Motivation: 当前最先进的视觉语言模型在理解否定时存在严重的肯定性偏见，特别是在描述性目标检测任务中，这限制了模型在现实世界应用中的可靠性。

Method: 提出了CoVAND数据集生成管道和NegToMe文本标记合并模块。NegToMe通过将否定词与属性词合并为语义连贯的短语来解决标记化过程中的否定线索丢失问题，并结合参数高效的LoRA微调方法。

Result: 该方法在挑战性否定基准测试中显著提升性能，在OVDEval上将NMS-AP提高了最多10.8个点，降低了假阳性率，并证明了对最先进视觉语言模型的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作在解决现实世界检测应用中的否定理解问题上迈出了关键一步，为视觉语言模型的否定理解能力提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) suffer from a critical failure
in understanding negation, often referred to as affirmative bias. This
limitation is particularly severe in described object detection (DOD) tasks. To
address this, we propose two primary contributions: (1) a new dataset pipeline
and (2) a novel, lightweight adaptation recipe. First, we introduce CoVAND, a
dataset constructed with a systematic chain-of-thought (CoT) and VQA-based
pipeline to generate high-quality, instance-grounded negation data. Second, we
propose NegToMe, a novel text token merging module that directly tackles the
architectural cause of affirmative bias. NegToMe fundamentally addresses the
structural loss of negation cues in tokenization, grouping them with attributes
into coherent semantic phrases. It maintains correct polarity at the input
level, enabling robust negation understanding even with limited data. For
instance, to prevent a model from treating the fragmented tokens "not" and
"girl" as simply "girl", NegToMe binds them into a single token whose meaning
is correctly distinguished from that of "girl" alone. This module is integrated
with a parameter-efficient and strategic LoRA fine-tuning approach. Our method
significantly improves performance on challenging negation benchmarks with a
lowered false positive rate, boosting NMS-AP by up to +10.8 points on OVDEval
and demonstrating generalization to SoTA VLMs. This work marks a crucial step
forward in addressing negation understanding for real-world detection
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有向量提取方法通常只针对单一向量类型，需要为不同结构使用单独模型，这限制了捕捉复杂结构的能力。

Method: 将向量编码为包含实例和几何信息的结构化查询，通过交互模块进行跨层级上下文交换，并使用动态形状约束优化全局结构和关键点。

Result: 在Multi-Vector数据集上的实验表明，UniVector在单结构和多结构向量提取任务上都达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: UniVector通过统一的实例-几何交互框架成功解决了多结构向量提取问题，为向量提取领域提供了更通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Vector extraction retrieves structured vector geometry from raster images,
offering high-fidelity representation and broad applicability. Existing
methods, however, are usually tailored to a single vector type (e.g., polygons,
polylines, line segments), requiring separate models for different structures.
This stems from treating instance attributes (category, structure) and
geometric attributes (point coordinates, connections) independently, limiting
the ability to capture complex structures. Inspired by the human brain's
simultaneous use of semantic and spatial interactions in visual perception, we
propose UniVector, a unified VE framework that leverages instance-geometry
interaction to extract multiple vector types within a single model. UniVector
encodes vectors as structured queries containing both instance- and
geometry-level information, and iteratively updates them through an interaction
module for cross-level context exchange. A dynamic shape constraint further
refines global structures and key points. To benchmark multi-structure
scenarios, we introduce the Multi-Vector dataset with diverse polygons,
polylines, and line segments. Experiments show UniVector sets a new state of
the art on both single- and multi-structure VE tasks. Code and dataset will be
released at https://github.com/yyyyll0ss/UniVector.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖大型语言模型的静态文本描述，缺乏对实时目标状态变化的适应性且容易产生幻觉。

Method: 使用显式提示将空间运动信息转换为自然语言描述提供时空指导，隐式提示结合伪词和可学习描述符构建个性化知识表示，并通过CLIP文本编码器动态调整。设计了判别性特征增强器来增强视觉和跨模态表示。

Conclusion: EPIPTrack通过动态多模态提示有效解决了现有跟踪方法在实时适应性和语义对齐方面的局限性。

Abstract: Multimodal semantic cues, such as textual descriptions, have shown strong
potential in enhancing target perception for tracking. However, existing
methods rely on static textual descriptions from large language models, which
lack adaptability to real-time target state changes and prone to
hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose a unified multimodal
vision-language tracking framework, named EPIPTrack, which leverages explicit
and implicit prompts for dynamic target modeling and semantic alignment.
Specifically, explicit prompts transform spatial motion information into
natural language descriptions to provide spatiotemporal guidance. Implicit
prompts combine pseudo-words with learnable descriptors to construct
individualized knowledge representations capturing appearance attributes. Both
prompts undergo dynamic adjustment via the CLIP text encoder to respond to
changes in target state. Furthermore, we design a Discriminative Feature
Augmentor to enhance visual and cross-modal representations. Extensive
experiments on MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack demonstrate that EPIPTrack
outperforms existing trackers in diverse scenarios, exhibiting robust
adaptability and superior performance.

Conclusion: 该工作揭示了VLA模型的对抗脆弱性，并提供了有效的攻击和防御方案，为提升VLA模型的鲁棒性提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved revolutionary progress in
robot learning, enabling robots to execute complex physical robot tasks from
natural language instructions. Despite this progress, their adversarial
robustness remains underexplored. In this work, we propose both adversarial
patch attack and corresponding defense strategies for VLA models. We first
introduce the Embedding Disruption Patch Attack (EDPA), a model-agnostic
adversarial attack that generates patches directly placeable within the
camera's view. In comparison to prior methods, EDPA can be readily applied to
different VLA models without requiring prior knowledge of the model
architecture, or the controlled robotic manipulator. EDPA constructs these
patches by (i) disrupting the semantic alignment between visual and textual
latent representations, and (ii) maximizing the discrepancy of latent
representations between adversarial and corresponding clean visual inputs.
Through the optimization of these objectives, EDPA distorts the VLA's
interpretation of visual information, causing the model to repeatedly generate
incorrect actions and ultimately result in failure to complete the given
robotic task. To counter this, we propose an adversarial fine-tuning scheme for
the visual encoder, in which the encoder is optimized to produce similar latent
representations for both clean and adversarially perturbed visual inputs.
Extensive evaluations on the widely recognized LIBERO robotic simulation
benchmark demonstrate that EDPA substantially increases the task failure rate
of cutting-edge VLA models, while our proposed defense effectively mitigates
this degradation. The codebase is accessible via the homepage at

large-scale datasets with accurate annotations. However, collecting and
annotating real-world UAV data is extremely challenging and costly. To address
this limitation, we present FlyAwareV2, a novel multimodal dataset encompassing
both real and synthetic UAV imagery tailored for urban scene understanding

varying weather and daytime; 2) Depth maps for real samples computed via
state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation; 3) Benchmarks for RGB and
multimodal semantic segmentation on standard architectures; 4) Studies on
synthetic-to-real domain adaptation to assess the generalization capabilities
of models trained on the synthetic data. With its rich set of annotations and
environmental diversity, FlyAwareV2 provides a valuable resource for research

Abstract: Outdoor 3D semantic scene generation produces realistic and semantically rich
environments for applications such as urban simulation and autonomous driving.
However, advances in this direction are constrained by the absence of publicly
available, well-annotated datasets. We introduce SketchSem3D, the first
large-scale benchmark for generating 3D outdoor semantic scenes from abstract
freehand sketches and pseudo-labeled annotations of satellite images.
SketchSem3D includes two subsets, Sketch-based SemanticKITTI and Sketch-based
KITTI-360 (containing LiDAR voxels along with their corresponding sketches and
annotated satellite images), to enable standardized, rigorous, and diverse
evaluations. We also propose Cylinder Mamba Diffusion (CymbaDiff) that
significantly enhances spatial coherence in outdoor 3D scene generation.
CymbaDiff imposes structured spatial ordering, explicitly captures cylindrical
continuity and vertical hierarchy, and preserves both physical neighborhood
relationships and global context within the generated scenes. Extensive
experiments on SketchSem3D demonstrate that CymbaDiff achieves superior
semantic consistency, spatial realism, and cross-dataset generalization. The
code and dataset will be available at

Motivation: 现有的人群计数方法在嵌入式系统应用中存在模型参数过多、计算复杂等问题，无法满足实时性要求。需要设计一个既能快速推理又保持准确性的模型。

Conclusion: 该网络适用于嵌入式系统上的超实时人群计数，在保证准确性的同时实现了最快的推理速度。

Abstract: Crowd counting is a task of estimating the number of the crowd through
images, which is extremely valuable in the fields of intelligent security,
urban planning, public safety management, and so on. However, the existing
counting methods have some problems in practical application on embedded
systems for these fields, such as excessive model parameters, abundant complex
calculations, etc. The practical application of embedded systems requires the
model to be real-time, which means that the model is fast enough. Considering
the aforementioned problems, we design a super real-time model with a
stem-encoder-decoder structure for crowd counting tasks, which achieves the
fastest inference compared with state-of-the-arts. Firstly, large convolution
kernels in the stem network are used to enlarge the receptive field, which
effectively extracts detailed head information. Then, in the encoder part, we
use conditional channel weighting and multi-branch local fusion block to merge
multi-scale features with low computational consumption. This part is crucial
to the super real-time performance of the model. Finally, the feature pyramid
networks are added to the top of the encoder to alleviate its incomplete fusion
problems. Experiments on three benchmarks show that our network is suitable for
super real-time crowd counting on embedded systems, ensuring competitive
accuracy. At the same time, the proposed network reasoning speed is the
fastest. Specifically, the proposed network achieves 381.7 FPS on NVIDIA GTX
1080Ti and 71.9 FPS on NVIDIA Jetson TX1.

Result: 在9种最先进VPR方法和6个基准数据集上的综合评估表明，这些度量能有效区分正确和错误的VPR匹配，优于现有方法且计算开销可忽略。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) enables robots and autonomous vehicles to
identify previously visited locations by matching current observations against
a database of known places. However, VPR systems face significant challenges
when deployed across varying visual environments, lighting conditions, seasonal
changes, and viewpoints changes. Failure-critical VPR applications, such as
loop closure detection in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)
pipelines, require robust estimation of place matching uncertainty. We propose
three training-free uncertainty metrics that estimate prediction confidence by
analyzing inherent statistical patterns in similarity scores from any existing
VPR method. Similarity Distribution (SD) quantifies match distinctiveness by
measuring score separation between candidates; Ratio Spread (RS) evaluates
competitive ambiguity among top-scoring locations; and Statistical Uncertainty
(SU) is a combination of SD and RS that provides a unified metric that
generalizes across datasets and VPR methods without requiring validation data
to select the optimal metric. All three metrics operate without additional
model training, architectural modifications, or computationally expensive
geometric verification. Comprehensive evaluation across nine state-of-the-art
VPR methods and six benchmark datasets confirms that our metrics excel at
discriminating between correct and incorrect VPR matches, and consistently
outperform existing approaches while maintaining negligible computational
overhead, making it deployable for real-time robotic applications across varied
environmental conditions with improved precision-recall performance.

*Minji Kim,Taekyung Kim,Bohyung Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究使用机制可解释性技术分析了视频大语言模型的内部信息流，揭示了视频问答任务中跨帧交互和视频-语言整合的特定模式，并发现可以通过选择有效信息路径来保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视频大语言模型在视频问答任务上取得了进展，但其内部如何提取和传播视频与文本信息的机制仍不明确，需要深入探索。

Method: 使用机制可解释性技术分析VideoLLMs的内部信息流，识别关键的信息传播路径和注意力模式。

Result: 发现视频问答任务中存在一致的跨帧交互和视频-语言整合模式：早期到中间层进行跨帧交互，中间层实现视频-语言整合，中后层生成正确答案。通过选择有效路径可以保持性能同时大幅减少注意力边（如LLaVA-NeXT-7B-Video-FT中减少58%）。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了VideoLLMs进行时序推理的机制，为改进模型可解释性和下游泛化提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) extend the capabilities of
vision-language models to spatiotemporal inputs, enabling tasks such as video
question answering (VideoQA). Despite recent advances in VideoLLMs, their
internal mechanisms on where and how they extract and propagate video and
textual information remain less explored. In this study, we investigate the
internal information flow of VideoLLMs using mechanistic interpretability
techniques. Our analysis reveals consistent patterns across diverse VideoQA
tasks: (1) temporal reasoning in VideoLLMs initiates with active cross-frame
interactions in early-to-middle layers, (2) followed by progressive
video-language integration in middle layers. This is facilitated by alignment
between video representations and linguistic embeddings containing temporal
concepts. (3) Upon completion of this integration, the model is ready to
generate correct answers in middle-to-late layers. (4) Based on our analysis,
we show that VideoLLMs can retain their VideoQA performance by selecting these
effective information pathways while suppressing a substantial amount of
attention edges, e.g., 58% in LLaVA-NeXT-7B-Video-FT. These findings provide a
blueprint on how VideoLLMs perform temporal reasoning and offer practical
insights for improving model interpretability and downstream generalization.

### [41] [Accelerated Feature Detectors for Visual SLAM: A Comparative Study of FPGA vs GPU](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13546)
*Ruiqi Ye,Mikel Luján*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文比较了GPU和FPGA在V-SLAM中加速特征检测的性能，发现传统特征检测器（FAST、Harris）在GPU上表现更好，而学习型检测器（SuperPoint）在FPGA上具有更好的运行时性能和能效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 特征检测是SLAM中耗时但关键的模块，特别是在功耗受限的平台（如无人机）上部署时。研究比较GPU和FPGA这两种硬件加速器在V-SLAM中的表现，为实际应用提供指导。

Method: 在Nvidia Jetson Orin和AMD Versal等现代SoC上，比较GPU和FPGA加速的FAST、Harris和SuperPoint特征检测器在V-SLAM流水线中的性能。

Result: 传统特征检测器（FAST、Harris）在GPU上表现更优，而学习型检测器SuperPoint在FPGA上可获得3.1倍运行时性能提升和1.4倍能效提升。FPGA加速的V-SLAM在2/5数据集序列中帧率更高，但GPU版本精度普遍更好。

Conclusion: 硬件加速特征检测可减少全局束调整调用频率而不损失精度。选择加速器需权衡检测器类型：传统检测器选GPU，学习型检测器选FPGA可获得更好性能。

Abstract: Feature detection is a common yet time-consuming module in Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM) implementations, which are increasingly
deployed on power-constrained platforms, such as drones. Graphics Processing
Units (GPUs) have been a popular accelerator for computer vision in general,
and feature detection and SLAM in particular.
  On the other hand, System-on-Chips (SoCs) with integrated Field Programmable
Gate Array (FPGA) are also widely available. This paper presents the first
study of hardware-accelerated feature detectors considering a Visual SLAM
(V-SLAM) pipeline. We offer new insights by comparing the best GPU-accelerated
FAST, Harris, and SuperPoint implementations against the FPGA-accelerated
counterparts on modern SoCs (Nvidia Jetson Orin and AMD Versal).
  The evaluation shows that when using a non-learning-based feature detector
such as FAST and Harris, their GPU implementations, and the GPU-accelerated
V-SLAM can achieve better run-time performance and energy efficiency than the
FAST and Harris FPGA implementations as well as the FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM.
However, when considering a learning-based detector such as SuperPoint, its
FPGA implementation can achieve better run-time performance and energy
efficiency (up to 3.1$\times$ and 1.4$\times$ improvements, respectively) than
the GPU implementation. The FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM can also achieve comparable
run-time performance compared to the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM, with better FPS in
2 out of 5 dataset sequences. When considering the accuracy, the results show
that the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM is more accurate than the FPGA-accelerated
V-SLAM in general. Last but not least, the use of hardware acceleration for
feature detection could further improve the performance of the V-SLAM pipeline
by having the global bundle adjustment module invoked less frequently without
sacrificing accuracy.

TL;DR: MDM是一个基于Mamba的多模态扩散模型，通过统一的变分自编码器实现多模态处理的统一，在图像生成、图像描述等任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前端到端多模态模型使用不同的编码器和解码器处理输入输出信息，这种分离阻碍了多模态的联合表示学习。

Method: 使用基于Mamba的多步选择扩散模型，通过统一的变分自编码器逐步生成和精炼模态特定信息，实现编码和解码的统一。

Result: 在图像生成、图像描述、视觉问答等任务中显著优于现有端到端模型，并能与GPT-4V、Gemini Pro等SOTA模型竞争。

Conclusion: MDM有效统一了多模态处理过程，同时保持计算效率，为端到端多模态架构开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Current end-to-end multi-modal models utilize different encoders and decoders
to process input and output information. This separation hinders the joint
representation learning of various modalities. To unify multi-modal processing,
we propose a novel architecture called MDM (Multi-modal Diffusion Mamba). MDM
utilizes a Mamba-based multi-step selection diffusion model to progressively
generate and refine modality-specific information through a unified variational
autoencoder for both encoding and decoding. This innovative approach allows MDM
to achieve superior performance when processing high-dimensional data,
particularly in generating high-resolution images and extended text sequences
simultaneously. Our evaluations in areas such as image generation, image
captioning, visual question answering, text comprehension, and reasoning tasks
demonstrate that MDM significantly outperforms existing end-to-end models
(MonoFormer, LlamaGen, and Chameleon etc.) and competes effectively with SOTA
models like GPT-4V, Gemini Pro, and Mistral. Our results validate MDM's
effectiveness in unifying multi-modal processes while maintaining computational
efficiency, establishing a new direction for end-to-end multi-modal
architectures.

TL;DR: 提出了MMLongCite基准来评估大型视觉语言模型在长上下文场景中的忠实度，发现现有模型在处理长多模态上下文时存在局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型的上下文窗口不断扩大，但扩展的上下文窗口并不能保证有效利用上下文，这对实际应用构成关键挑战。现有的长上下文忠实度评估主要集中在纯文本领域，而多模态评估仍局限于短上下文。

Method: 引入MMLongCite基准，包含8个不同任务，涵盖6个上下文长度区间，并整合了文本、图像和视频等多种模态。

Result: 对最先进的大型视觉语言模型的评估显示，它们在处理长多模态上下文时的忠实度有限。深入分析了上下文长度和关键内容位置对模型忠实度的影响。

Conclusion: 当前大型视觉语言模型在长多模态上下文处理方面存在显著局限性，需要进一步改进以确保在实际应用中的可靠表现。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large vision language models (LVLMs) has led to a
significant expansion of their context windows. However, an extended context
window does not guarantee the effective utilization of the context, posing a
critical challenge for real-world applications. Current evaluations of such
long-context faithfulness are predominantly focused on the text-only domain,
while multimodal assessments remain limited to short contexts. To bridge this
gap, we introduce MMLongCite, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
the fidelity of LVLMs in long-context scenarios. MMLongCite comprises 8
distinct tasks spanning 6 context length intervals and incorporates diverse
modalities, including text, images, and videos. Our evaluation of
state-of-the-art LVLMs reveals their limited faithfulness in handling long
multimodal contexts. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis of how
context length and the position of crucial content affect the faithfulness of
these models.

*JiaKui Hu,Zhengjian Yao,Lujia Jin,Yinghao Chen,Yanye Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MaskDCPT预训练方法，通过退化类型分类和图像重建来提升图像恢复任务的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统预训练方法在图像恢复任务中表现有限，需要一种能够同时处理多种退化类型的通用预训练方法

Method: 使用编码器和两个解码器：编码器提取特征，分类解码器识别退化类型，重建解码器重构高质量图像

Result: 在5D全能恢复任务中PSNR至少提升3.77dB，在真实世界退化场景中PIQE降低34.8%，对未见过的退化类型具有强泛化能力

Conclusion: MaskDCPT为通用图像恢复提供了有效的预训练方法，显著提升了CNN和Transformer的性能

Abstract: This study introduces a Masked Degradation Classification Pre-Training method
(MaskDCPT), designed to facilitate the classification of degradation types in
input images, leading to comprehensive image restoration pre-training. Unlike
conventional pre-training methods, MaskDCPT uses the degradation type of the
image as an extremely weak supervision, while simultaneously leveraging the
image reconstruction to enhance performance and robustness. MaskDCPT includes
an encoder and two decoders: the encoder extracts features from the masked
low-quality input image. The classification decoder uses these features to
identify the degradation type, whereas the reconstruction decoder aims to
reconstruct a corresponding high-quality image. This design allows the
pre-training to benefit from both masked image modeling and contrastive
learning, resulting in a generalized representation suited for restoration
tasks. Benefit from the straightforward yet potent MaskDCPT, the pre-trained
encoder can be used to address universal image restoration and achieve
outstanding performance. Implementing MaskDCPT significantly improves
performance for both convolution neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers, with
a minimum increase in PSNR of 3.77 dB in the 5D all-in-one restoration task and
a 34.8% reduction in PIQE compared to baseline in real-world degradation
scenarios. It also emergences strong generalization to previously unseen
degradation types and levels. In addition, we curate and release the UIR-2.5M
dataset, which includes 2.5 million paired restoration samples across 19
degradation types and over 200 degradation levels, incorporating both synthetic
and real-world data. The dataset, source code, and models are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在学习基础类和新型类之间的相关性时存在混淆问题，需要更强的约束来准确捕捉类别对应的点云表示。

Method: 使用结构因果模型(SCM)重新形式化3D-NCD问题，提出因果表示和推理联合学习方法，包括消除混杂因子的因果表示原型和基于图结构的因果推理。

Result: 在3D和2D NCD语义分割任务上的大量实验和可视化结果证明了方法的优越性。

Conclusion: 通过引入因果建模，能够更准确地学习基础类和新型类之间的表示相关性，有效解决点云分割中的新类发现问题。

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on Novel Class Discovery for Point Cloud Segmentation
(3D-NCD), aiming to learn a model that can segment unlabeled (novel) 3D classes
using only the supervision from labeled (base) 3D classes. The key to this task
is to setup the exact correlations between the point representations and their
base class labels, as well as the representation correlations between the
points from base and novel classes. A coarse or statistical correlation
learning may lead to the confusion in novel class inference. lf we impose a
causal relationship as a strong correlated constraint upon the learning
process, the essential point cloud representations that accurately correspond
to the classes should be uncovered. To this end, we introduce a structural
causal model (SCM) to re-formalize the 3D-NCD problem and propose a new method,
i.e., Joint Learning of Causal Representation and Reasoning. Specifically, we
first analyze hidden confounders in the base class representations and the
causal relationships between the base and novel classes through SCM. We devise
a causal representation prototype that eliminates confounders to capture the
causal representations of base classes. A graph structure is then used to model
the causal relationships between the base classes' causal representation
prototypes and the novel class prototypes, enabling causal reasoning from base
to novel classes. Extensive experiments and visualization results on 3D and 2D
NCD semantic segmentation demonstrate the superiorities of our method.

TL;DR: 本文提出了InstantSfM，通过GPU并行计算加速标准SfM管线的关键阶段，在保持重建精度的同时实现约40倍的速度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SfM方法（如COLMAP）在CPU上实现存在计算开销大的问题，而基于深度学习的SfM方法（如VGGSfM）无法扩展到数千张输入图像。

Method: 利用GPU并行计算加速SfM管线的关键阶段，基于稀疏感知的束调整优化技术，在统一的全局SfM框架中同时加速BA和GP。

Result: 在不同规模数据集上的实验表明，相比COLMAP实现了约40倍的速度提升，同时保持了相当甚至更好的重建精度。

Conclusion: InstantSfM成功释放了GPU并行计算的潜力，在保持精度的同时大幅提升了SfM的计算效率。

Abstract: Structure-from-Motion (SfM), a method that recovers camera poses and scene
geometry from uncalibrated images, is a central component in robotic
reconstruction and simulation. Despite the state-of-the-art performance of
traditional SfM methods such as COLMAP and its follow-up work, GLOMAP, naive
CPU-specialized implementations of bundle adjustment (BA) or global positioning
(GP) introduce significant computational overhead when handling large-scale
scenarios, leading to a trade-off between accuracy and speed in SfM. Moreover,
the blessing of efficient C++-based implementations in COLMAP and GLOMAP comes
with the curse of limited flexibility, as they lack support for various
external optimization options. On the other hand, while deep learning based SfM
pipelines like VGGSfM and VGGT enable feed-forward 3D reconstruction, they are
unable to scale to thousands of input views at once as GPU memory consumption
increases sharply as the number of input views grows. In this paper, we unleash
the full potential of GPU parallel computation to accelerate each critical
stage of the standard SfM pipeline. Building upon recent advances in
sparse-aware bundle adjustment optimization, our design extends these
techniques to accelerate both BA and GP within a unified global SfM framework.
Through extensive experiments on datasets of varying scales (e.g. 5000 images
where VGGSfM and VGGT run out of memory), our method demonstrates up to about
40 times speedup over COLMAP while achieving consistently comparable or even
improved reconstruction accuracy. Our project page can be found at

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的训练自由解码策略，通过自增强提示和自适应阈值算法，显著减少大型视觉语言模型的幻觉问题，提高事实一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型继承了语言模型的幻觉倾向，现有视觉对比解码方法使用通用的视觉增强，忽略了文本查询的具体上下文，限制了效果。

Method: 1. 自增强提示策略：利用模型内在知识动态对齐查询和视觉增强的语义；2. 自适应阈值算法：基于输出稀疏性自适应调整下一个token候选大小，充分利用logit分布信息。

Result: 在4个LVLM和7个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，所提出的解码方法相比最先进的解码方法显著提高了事实一致性。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了整合查询相关的增强和熵感知解码对于改进LVLM有效生成的重要性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal
capabilities, but they inherit the tendency to hallucinate from their
underlying language models. While visual contrastive decoding has been proposed
to mitigate this issue, existing methods often apply generic visual
augmentations that disregard the specific context provided by the text query,
limiting their effectiveness. This study introduces a novel training-free
decoding strategy that addresses these limitations, featuring two key
contributions. First, a self-augmentation prompting strategy that leverages the
intrinsic knowledge of the model to dynamically align semantics between the
query and the visual augmentation. Second, an adaptive thresholding algorithm
that adaptively adjusts next token candidate size based on the output sparsity,
utilizing full information from the logit distribution. Extensive experiments
across four LVLMs and seven benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed decoding
significantly enhances factual consistency compared to state-of-the-art
decoding methods. This work highlights the importance of integrating
query-dependent augmentation and entropy-aware decoding for improving effective
generation of LVLMs.

Motivation: 日常生活中，我们所消费和看到的内容高度影响我们的注意力。吸引和保持注意力（即视觉有趣性的定义）至关重要。随着大型多模态模型的发展，需要探索这些模型在理解视觉有趣性概念方面的潜力。

Method: 通过比较分析人类评估与GPT-4o预测的一致性，利用这种部分对齐来有效标注图像对的相对有趣性，并将这些数据用于训练学习排序模型。

Result: 研究发现人类与GPT-4o在视觉有趣性评估上存在部分对齐，GPT-4o在此概念上的表现优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 这些发现为更深入理解人类兴趣铺平了道路，证明了大型多模态模型在捕捉视觉有趣性概念方面的有效性。

Abstract: Our daily life is highly influenced by what we consume and see. Attracting
and holding one's attention -- the definition of (visual) interestingness -- is
essential. The rise of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) trained on large-scale
visual and textual data has demonstrated impressive capabilities. We explore
these models' potential to understand to what extent the concepts of visual
interestingness are captured and examine the alignment between human
assessments and GPT-4o's, a leading LMM, predictions through comparative
analysis. Our studies reveal partial alignment between humans and GPT-4o. It
already captures the concept as best compared to state-of-the-art methods.
Hence, this allows for the effective labeling of image pairs according to their
(commonly) interestingness, which are used as training data to distill the
knowledge into a learning-to-rank model. The insights pave the way for a deeper
understanding of human interest.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于经验观察发现，当RAFT等光流估计网络的其他部分充分训练后，代价体变得不再重要，但其计算和空间复杂度限制了处理速度和输入帧分辨率。

Method: 引入一种训练策略，在训练过程中逐步移除代价体，创建了三种不同计算预算的模型。

Result: 最准确的模型达到最先进精度，同时比可比模型快1.2倍、内存占用降低6倍；最快模型能够在仅使用500MB GPU内存的情况下以20FPS处理全高清帧。

Conclusion: 该训练策略成功实现了在保持精度的同时显著提升光流估计的效率和实用性。

Abstract: Cost volumes are used in every modern optical flow estimator, but due to
their computational and space complexity, they are often a limiting factor
regarding both processing speed and the resolution of input frames. Motivated
by our empirical observation that cost volumes lose their importance once all
other network parts of, e.g., a RAFT-based pipeline have been sufficiently
trained, we introduce a training strategy that allows removing the cost volume
from optical flow estimators throughout training. This leads to significantly
improved inference speed and reduced memory requirements. Using our training
strategy, we create three different models covering different compute budgets.
Our most accurate model reaches state-of-the-art accuracy while being
$1.2\times$ faster and having a $6\times$ lower memory footprint than
comparable models; our fastest model is capable of processing Full HD frames at
$20\,\mathrm{FPS}$ using only $500\,\mathrm{MB}$ of GPU memory.

Abstract: Concealed weapon detection aims at detecting weapons hidden beneath a
person's clothing or luggage. Various imaging modalities like Millimeter Wave,
Microwave, Terahertz, Infrared, etc., are exploited for the concealed weapon
detection task. These imaging modalities have their own limitations, such as
poor resolution in microwave imaging, privacy concerns in millimeter wave
imaging, etc. To provide a real-time, 24 x 7 surveillance, low-cost, and
privacy-preserved solution, we opted for thermal imaging in spite of the lack
of availability of a benchmark dataset. We propose a novel approach and a
dataset for concealed weapon detection in thermal imagery. Our YOLO-based
architecture, DEF-YOLO, is built with key enhancements in YOLOv8 tailored to
the unique challenges of concealed weapon detection in thermal vision. We adopt
deformable convolutions at the SPPF layer to exploit multi-scale features;
backbone and neck layers to extract low, mid, and high-level features, enabling
DEF-YOLO to adaptively focus on localization around the objects in thermal
homogeneous regions, without sacrificing much of the speed and throughput. In
addition to these simple yet effective key architectural changes, we introduce
a new, large-scale Thermal Imaging Concealed Weapon dataset, TICW, featuring a
diverse set of concealed weapons and capturing a wide range of scenarios. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale contributed dataset
for this task. We also incorporate focal loss to address the significant class
imbalance inherent in the concealed weapon detection task. The efficacy of the
proposed work establishes a new benchmark through extensive experimentation for
concealed weapon detection in thermal imagery.

Motivation: VQ-VAE在自监督学习中存在码本崩溃问题，现有方法使用隐式静态码本或联合优化整个码本，限制了码本学习能力并降低了重建质量。

Method: Group-VQ方法进行分组优化码本，每个组独立优化，组内进行联合优化，同时提出了训练后码本重采样方法。

Result: 在各种图像重建实验设置下，Group-VQ在重建指标上表现出改进性能，训练后码本采样方法实现了调整码本大小的灵活性。

Conclusion: Group-VQ方法改善了码本利用率和重建性能之间的权衡，训练后码本重采样提供了码本大小调整的灵活性。

Abstract: Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) leverage self-supervised
learning through reconstruction tasks to represent continuous vectors using the
closest vectors in a codebook. However, issues such as codebook collapse
persist in the VQ model. To address these issues, existing approaches employ
implicit static codebooks or jointly optimize the entire codebook, but these
methods constrain the codebook's learning capability, leading to reduced
reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose Group-VQ, which performs
group-wise optimization on the codebook. Each group is optimized independently,
with joint optimization performed within groups. This approach improves the
trade-off between codebook utilization and reconstruction performance.
Additionally, we introduce a training-free codebook resampling method, allowing
post-training adjustment of the codebook size. In image reconstruction
experiments under various settings, Group-VQ demonstrates improved performance
on reconstruction metrics. And the post-training codebook sampling method
achieves the desired flexibility in adjusting the codebook size.

Motivation: 现有NR-VQA数据集和指标主要针对相机拍摄视频，直接应用于渲染视频会产生偏差预测，因为渲染视频更容易出现时间伪影

Method: 创建大型渲染导向视频数据集，包含主观质量标注，并设计专门针对渲染视频的NR-VQA指标，同时考虑图像质量和时间稳定性

Conclusion: 该工作填补了渲染视频质量评估的空白，为计算机图形应用提供了更准确的视频质量评估工具

Abstract: Quality assessment of videos is crucial for many computer graphics
applications, including video games, virtual reality, and augmented reality,
where visual performance has a significant impact on user experience. When test
videos cannot be perfectly aligned with references or when references are
unavailable, the significance of no-reference video quality assessment (NR-VQA)
methods is undeniable. However, existing NR-VQA datasets and metrics are
primarily focused on camera-captured videos; applying them directly to rendered
videos would result in biased predictions, as rendered videos are more prone to
temporal artifacts. To address this, we present a large rendering-oriented
video dataset with subjective quality annotations, as well as a designed NR-VQA
metric specific to rendered videos. The proposed dataset includes a wide range
of 3D scenes and rendering settings, with quality scores annotated for various
display types to better reflect real-world application scenarios. Building on
this dataset, we calibrate our NR-VQA metric to assess rendered video quality
by looking at both image quality and temporal stability. We compare our metric
to existing NR-VQA metrics, demonstrating its superior performance on rendered
videos. Finally, we demonstrate that our metric can be used to benchmark
supersampling methods and assess frame generation strategies in real-time
rendering.

*MingZe Tang,Jubal Chandy Jacob*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现，在视觉语言模型的零样本分类中，对于高性能模型，最简单的提示词效果最好，而增加描述性细节反而会降低性能，这种现象被称为'提示过拟合'。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视觉语言模型在零样本分类中，提示词设计对识别视觉相似类别（如人体姿态）的影响，特别是在数据稀缺条件下的表现。

Method: 使用285张COCO数据集图像，评估OpenCLIP、MetaCLIP 2和SigLip等现代视觉语言模型，采用三层次提示词设计系统性地增加语言细节。

Result: 对于性能最高的模型（MetaCLIP 2和OpenCLIP），最简单的基础提示词始终获得最佳结果，增加描述性细节会显著降低性能（如MetaCLIP 2的多类准确率从68.8%降至55.1%）。相反，性能较低的SigLip模型在提供更多基于身体线索的描述性提示词时，对模糊类别的分类有所改善。

Conclusion: 提示词设计对视觉语言模型的零样本分类性能有显著影响，高性能模型容易出现'提示过拟合'现象，而简单提示词往往效果更好；不同模型对提示词复杂度的响应存在差异。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable zero-shot classification by
aligning images and text in a shared space, a promising approach for
data-scarce conditions. However, the influence of prompt design on recognizing
visually similar categories, such as human postures, is not well understood.
This study investigates how prompt specificity affects the zero-shot
classification of sitting, standing, and walking/running on a small, 285-image
COCO-derived dataset. A suite of modern VLMs, including OpenCLIP, MetaCLIP 2,
and SigLip, were evaluated using a three-tiered prompt design that
systematically increases linguistic detail. Our findings reveal a compelling,
counter-intuitive trend: for the highest-performing models (MetaCLIP 2 and
OpenCLIP), the simplest, most basic prompts consistently achieve the best
results. Adding descriptive detail significantly degrades performance for
instance, MetaCLIP 2's multi-class accuracy drops from 68.8\% to 55.1\% a
phenomenon we term "prompt overfitting". Conversely, the lower-performing
SigLip model shows improved classification on ambiguous classes when given more
descriptive, body-cue-based prompts.

TL;DR: DepthVLA是一种增强空间推理能力的视觉-语言-动作模型，通过集成预训练深度预测模块，在混合变换器架构中统一视觉语言模型、深度变换器和动作专家，显著提升空间感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型在需要精确空间推理的任务上表现不佳，因为它们从视觉语言模型继承的空间推理能力有限，且依赖大量动作数据预训练来在3D空间中落地，这降低了训练效率且仍不足以实现准确的空间理解。

Method: 提出DepthVLA架构，采用混合变换器设计，将视觉语言模型、深度变换器和动作专家通过完全共享注意力机制统一起来，形成一个端到端模型，通过预训练深度预测模块显式地融入空间感知。

Result: 在真实世界和模拟环境中的广泛评估显示，DepthVLA优于最先进方法：真实世界任务中达到78.5% vs. 65.0%的进展，LIBERO模拟器中达到94.9% vs. 93.6%，Simpler模拟器中达到74.8% vs. 58.8%。

Conclusion: DepthVLA通过显式集成空间感知能力，有效解决了VLA模型在精确空间推理任务上的性能退化问题，在多种环境中都取得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently shown impressive
generalization and language-guided manipulation capabilities. However, their
performance degrades on tasks requiring precise spatial reasoning due to
limited spatial reasoning inherited from Vision-Language Models (VLMs).
Existing VLAs rely on extensive action-data pretraining to ground VLMs in 3D
space, which reduces training efficiency and is still insufficient for accurate
spatial understanding. In this work, we present DepthVLA, a simple yet
effective VLA architecture that explicitly incorporates spatial awareness
through a pretrained depth prediction module. DepthVLA adopts a
mixture-of-transformers design that unifies a VLM, a depth transformer, and an
action expert with fully shared attentions, forming an end-to-end model with
enhanced spatial reasoning. Extensive evaluations in both real-world and
simulated environments show that DepthVLA outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving 78.5% vs. 65.0% progress in real-world tasks, 94.9% vs.
93.6% in the LIBERO simulator, and 74.8% vs. 58.8% in the Simpler simulator.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GLSDA框架，利用预训练大模型的语义先验增强WiFi手势识别的泛化能力和语义表达能力，通过双路径CSI编码、多尺度语义编码器和鲁棒双蒸馏策略，在保持轻量化的同时提升跨域识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有WiFi手势识别方法存在泛化能力有限和语义表达能力不足的问题，主要由于CSI的域敏感性以及缺乏高层手势抽象表示。

Method: 设计双路径CSI编码管道捕获几何和动态手势模式，使用多尺度语义编码器学习鲁棒时序嵌入并通过跨模态注意力对齐语义，引入语义感知软监督增强类别区分，开发鲁棒双蒸馏策略压缩模型。

Result: 在Widar3.0基准测试中，GLSDA在域内和跨域手势识别任务上均优于现有方法，同时显著减小模型大小和推理延迟。

Conclusion: GLSDA为现实AIoT应用中的通用RF手势接口提供了可扩展和可部署的解决方案。

Abstract: WiFi-based gesture recognition has emerged as a promising RF sensing paradigm
for enabling non-contact and privacy-preserving human-computer interaction in
AIoT environments. However, existing methods often suffer from limited
generalization and semantic expressiveness due to the domain-sensitive nature
of Channel State Information and the lack of high-level gesture abstraction. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel generalization framework, termed
Large-Model-Aware Semantic Distillation and Alignment (GLSDA), which leverages
the semantic prior of pre-trained large foundation models to enhance gesture
representation learning in both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios.
Specifically, we first design a dual-path CSI encoding pipeline that captures
geometric and dynamic gesture patterns via CSI-Ratio phase sequences and
Doppler spectrograms. These representations are then fed into a Multiscale
Semantic Encoder, which learns robust temporal embeddings and aligns them with
gesture semantics through cross-modal attention mechanisms. To further enhance
category discrimination, we introduce a Semantic-Aware Soft Supervision scheme
that encodes inter-class correlations and reduces label ambiguity, especially
for semantically similar gestures. Finally, we develop a Robust
Dual-Distillation strategy to compress the aligned model into a lightweight
student network, jointly distilling intermediate features and semantic-informed
soft labels from the teacher model. Extensive experiments on the Widar3.0
benchmark show that GLSDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
both in-domain and cross-domain gesture recognition tasks, while significantly
reducing model size and inference latency. Our method offers a scalable and
deployable solution for generalized RF-based gesture interfaces in real-world
AIoT applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准在评估空间推理能力方面不足，特别是对人类空间认知至关重要的内在动态空间推理。需要更全面的评估框架来推动视觉语言模型在机器人、增强现实等领域的应用。

Method: 基于认知分类法将任务分为四个象限：内在静态、内在动态、外在静态、外在动态空间推理。开发了可扩展的自动化流水线生成多样且可验证的空间推理问题。

Result: 创建了包含559个评估VQA对和12K+训练VQA对的数据集。评估28个最先进的VLM发现，当前模型与人类能力存在显著差距，特别是在多步骤多视图空间推理方面。

Conclusion: Spatial-DISE为未来研究提供了稳健的框架、有价值的数据集和明确方向，推动实现类人空间智能。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning ability is crucial for Vision Language Models (VLMs) to
support real-world applications in diverse domains including robotics,
augmented reality, and autonomous navigation. Unfortunately, existing
benchmarks are inadequate in assessing spatial reasoning ability, especially
the \emph{intrinsic-dynamic} spatial reasoning which is a fundamental aspect of
human spatial cognition. In this paper, we propose a unified benchmark,
\textbf{Spatial-DISE}, based on a cognitively grounded taxonomy that
categorizes tasks into four fundamental quadrants:
\textbf{I}ntrinsic-\textbf{S}tatic, Intrinsic-\textbf{D}ynamic,
\textbf{E}xtrinsic-Static, and Extrinsic-Dynamic spatial reasoning. Moreover,
to address the issue of data scarcity, we develop a scalable and automated
pipeline to generate diverse and verifiable spatial reasoning questions,
resulting in a new \textbf{Spatial-DISE} dataset that includes Spatial-DISE
Bench (559 evaluation VQA pairs) and Spatial-DISE-12K (12K+ training VQA
pairs). Our comprehensive evaluation across 28 state-of-the-art VLMs reveals
that, current VLMs have a large and consistent gap to human competence,
especially on multi-step multi-view spatial reasoning. Spatial-DISE offers a
robust framework, valuable dataset, and clear direction for future research
toward human-like spatial intelligence. Benchmark, dataset, and code will be
publicly released.

TL;DR: 提出了Mask-GRPO方法，首次将基于GRPO的强化学习应用于被忽视的掩码生成模型范式，通过重新定义转移概率和将去掩码过程建模为多步决策问题，显著提升了文本到图像生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法主要针对扩散模型或自回归模型，忽视了掩码生成模型这一重要替代方案。

Method: 提出Mask-GRPO方法，重新定义转移概率，将去掩码过程建模为多步决策问题，并采用去除KL约束、应用缩减策略和过滤低质量样本等策略。

Result: 在标准文本到图像基准测试和偏好对齐方面显著改进基础模型Show-o，超越了现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: Mask-GRPO成功将强化学习应用于掩码生成模型，为该领域提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has garnered increasing attention in
text-to-image (T2I) generation. However, most existing RL approaches are
tailored to either diffusion models or autoregressive models, overlooking an
important alternative: masked generative models. In this work, we propose
Mask-GRPO, the first method to incorporate Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO)-based RL into this overlooked paradigm. Our core insight is to redefine
the transition probability, which is different from current approaches, and
formulate the unmasking process as a multi-step decision-making problem. To
further enhance our method, we explore several useful strategies, including
removing the KL constraint, applying the reduction strategy, and filtering out
low-quality samples. Using Mask-GRPO, we improve a base model, Show-o, with
substantial improvements on standard T2I benchmarks and preference alignment,
outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches. The code is available on

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Patch-Adapter是一个用于高分辨率文本引导图像修复的有效框架，能够实现4K+分辨率，同时保持内容一致性和提示对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法局限于较低分辨率，随着分辨率和纹理复杂度的增加，内容一致性和提示对齐这两个关键挑战变得更加困难。

Method: 采用两阶段适配器架构：双上下文适配器在降低分辨率下学习掩码和非掩码区域的连贯性以建立全局结构一致性；参考补丁适配器通过补丁级注意力机制实现全分辨率修复，通过自适应特征融合保持局部细节保真度。

Result: Patch-Adapter不仅解决了大规模修复中常见的伪影问题，还在OpenImages和Photo-Concept-Bucket数据集上实现了最先进的性能，在感知质量和文本提示遵循方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该双阶段架构通过解耦全局语义和局部细化，独特地解决了高分辨率修复中的可扩展性差距。

Abstract: In this work, we present Patch-Adapter, an effective framework for
high-resolution text-guided image inpainting. Unlike existing methods limited
to lower resolutions, our approach achieves 4K+ resolution while maintaining
precise content consistency and prompt alignment, two critical challenges in
image inpainting that intensify with increasing resolution and texture
complexity. Patch-Adapter leverages a two-stage adapter architecture to scale
the diffusion model's resolution from 1K to 4K+ without requiring structural
overhauls: (1) Dual Context Adapter learns coherence between masked and
unmasked regions at reduced resolutions to establish global structural
consistency; and (2) Reference Patch Adapter implements a patch-level attention
mechanism for full-resolution inpainting, preserving local detail fidelity
through adaptive feature fusion. This dual-stage architecture uniquely
addresses the scalability gap in high-resolution inpainting by decoupling
global semantics from localized refinement. Experiments demonstrate that
Patch-Adapter not only resolves artifacts common in large-scale inpainting but
also achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OpenImages and
Photo-Concept-Bucket datasets, outperforming existing methods in both
perceptual quality and text-prompt adherence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CoDS方法解决自动驾驶中异构场景下的协作感知问题，通过轻量级空间-通道调整器和域分离分布对齐模块来有效处理特征差异，同时保持高效推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有协作感知方法假设所有智能体使用相同编码器，但在实际异构部署中不成立。现有方法在特征对齐时容易受到域差距噪声影响，且基于transformer的方法在移动设备上推理效率低。

Method: 使用轻量级空间-通道调整器(LSCR)进行空间和通道维度的特征对齐，通过域分离分布对齐(DADS)模块分离域相关信息和任务相关信息，并采用域对齐互信息(DAMI)损失来增强域分离过程。

Result: CoDS在异构场景下有效缓解了特征差异，在检测精度和推理效率之间取得了良好平衡。

Conclusion: CoDS通过完全卷积架构实现了高效的协作感知，能够有效处理异构场景中的特征差异问题，为实际部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Collaborative perception has been proven to improve individual perception in
autonomous driving through multi-agent interaction. Nevertheless, most methods
often assume identical encoders for all agents, which does not hold true when
these models are deployed in real-world applications. To realize collaborative
perception in actual heterogeneous scenarios, existing methods usually align
neighbor features to those of the ego vehicle, which is vulnerable to noise
from domain gaps and thus fails to address feature discrepancies effectively.
Moreover, they adopt transformer-based modules for domain adaptation, which
causes the model inference inefficiency on mobile devices. To tackle these
issues, we propose CoDS, a Collaborative perception method that leverages
Domain Separation to address feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios.
The CoDS employs two feature alignment modules, i.e., Lightweight
Spatial-Channel Resizer (LSCR) and Distribution Alignment via Domain Separation
(DADS). Besides, it utilizes the Domain Alignment Mutual Information (DAMI)
loss to ensure effective feature alignment. Specifically, the LSCR aligns the
neighbor feature across spatial and channel dimensions using a lightweight
convolutional layer. Subsequently, the DADS mitigates feature distribution
discrepancy with encoder-specific and encoder-agnostic domain separation
modules. The former removes domain-dependent information and the latter
captures task-related information. During training, the DAMI loss maximizes the
mutual information between aligned heterogeneous features to enhance the domain
separation process. The CoDS employs a fully convolutional architecture, which
ensures high inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
CoDS effectively mitigates feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios and
achieves a trade-off between detection accuracy and inference efficiency.

Method: 使用可微分渲染管道优化可变形网格，用径向基函数参数化网格变形，学习最大化神经元响应的偏移和尺度，同时强制几何规律性。

Result: 应用于猴子V4区域模型，能够探测神经元对可解释3D因素（如姿态和光照）的选择性。

Conclusion: 该方法将逆图形学与系统神经科学连接起来，提供了一种超越传统基于像素方法、基于物理基础的3D刺激来探测神经选择性的途径。

Abstract: Visual perception relies on inference of 3D scene properties such as shape,
pose, and lighting. To understand how visual sensory neurons enable robust
perception, it is crucial to characterize their selectivity to such physically
interpretable factors. However, current approaches mainly operate on 2D pixels,
making it difficult to isolate selectivity for physical scene properties. To
address this limitation, we introduce a differentiable rendering pipeline that
optimizes deformable meshes to obtain MEIs directly in 3D. The method
parameterizes mesh deformations with radial basis functions and learns offsets
and scales that maximize neuronal responses while enforcing geometric
regularity. Applied to models of monkey area V4, our approach enables probing
neuronal selectivity to interpretable 3D factors such as pose and lighting.
This approach bridges inverse graphics with systems neuroscience, offering a
way to probe neural selectivity with physically grounded, 3D stimuli beyond
conventional pixel-based methods.

Method: 通过四个研究，使用CNN和PLS模型进行对比分析，包括2D CNN增强光谱卷积层的方法，以及基于RGB图像、NIR光谱和NIR-HSI图像的建模。

Conclusion: 近红外高光谱成像在食品质量分析中具有潜力，CNN在复杂参数建模中表现优异，而PLS在简单分析中仍具价值。同时开发了两个开源Python包以促进相关研究。

Abstract: This thesis investigates the application of near-infrared hyperspectral
imaging (NIR-HSI) for food quality analysis. The investigation is conducted
through four studies operating with five research hypotheses. For several
analyses, the studies compare models based on convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) and partial least squares (PLS). Generally, joint spatio-spectral
analysis with CNNs outperforms spatial analysis with CNNs and spectral analysis
with PLS when modeling parameters where chemical and physical visual
information are relevant. When modeling chemical parameters with a
2-dimensional (2D) CNN, augmenting the CNN with an initial layer dedicated to
performing spectral convolution enhances its predictive performance by learning
a spectral preprocessing similar to that applied by domain experts. Still,
PLS-based spectral modeling performs equally well for analysis of the mean
content of chemical parameters in samples and is the recommended approach.
Modeling the spatial distribution of chemical parameters with NIR-HSI is
limited by the ability to obtain spatially resolved reference values.
Therefore, a study used bulk mean references for chemical map generation of fat
content in pork bellies. A PLS-based approach gave non-smooth chemical maps and
pixel-wise predictions outside the range of 0-100\%. Conversely, a 2D CNN
augmented with a spectral convolution layer mitigated all issues arising with
PLS. The final study attempted to model barley's germinative capacity by
analyzing NIR spectra, RGB images, and NIR-HSI images. However, the results
were inconclusive due to the dataset's low degree of germination. Additionally,
this thesis has led to the development of two open-sourced Python packages. The
first facilitates fast PLS-based modeling, while the second facilitates very
fast cross-validation of PLS and other classical machine learning models with a
new algorithm.

Abstract: The rapid progress of large, pretrained models for both visual content
generation and 3D reconstruction opens up new possibilities for text-to-3D
generation. Intuitively, one could obtain a formidable 3D scene generator if
one were able to combine the power of a modern latent text-to-video model as
"generator" with the geometric abilities of a recent (feedforward) 3D
reconstruction system as "decoder". We introduce VIST3A, a general framework
that does just that, addressing two main challenges. First, the two components
must be joined in a way that preserves the rich knowledge encoded in their
weights. We revisit model stitching, i.e., we identify the layer in the 3D
decoder that best matches the latent representation produced by the
text-to-video generator and stitch the two parts together. That operation
requires only a small dataset and no labels. Second, the text-to-video
generator must be aligned with the stitched 3D decoder, to ensure that the
generated latents are decodable into consistent, perceptually convincing 3D
scene geometry. To that end, we adapt direct reward finetuning, a popular
technique for human preference alignment. We evaluate the proposed VIST3A
approach with different video generators and 3D reconstruction models. All
tested pairings markedly improve over prior text-to-3D models that output
Gaussian splats. Moreover, by choosing a suitable 3D base model, VIST3A also
enables high-quality text-to-pointmap generation.

Conclusion: 模型具有高度自适应性和灵活性，可用于开发实际应用中的端到端情绪识别系统，代码和结果已公开。

Abstract: In many domains, including online education, healthcare, security, and
human-computer interaction, facial emotion recognition (FER) is essential.
Real-world FER is still difficult despite its significance because of some
factors such as variable head positions, occlusions, illumination shifts, and
demographic diversity. Engagement detection, which is essential for
applications like virtual learning and customer services, is frequently
challenging due to FER limitations by many current models. In this article, we
propose ExpressNet-MoE, a novel hybrid deep learning model that blends both
Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) and Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, to
overcome the difficulties. Our model dynamically chooses the most pertinent
expert networks, thus it aids in the generalization and providing flexibility
to model across a wide variety of datasets. Our model improves on the accuracy
of emotion recognition by utilizing multi-scale feature extraction to collect
both global and local facial features. ExpressNet-MoE includes numerous
CNN-based feature extractors, a MoE module for adaptive feature selection, and
finally a residual network backbone for deep feature learning. To demonstrate
efficacy of our proposed model we evaluated on several datasets, and compared
with current state-of-the-art methods. Our model achieves accuracies of 74.77%
on AffectNet (v7), 72.55% on AffectNet (v8), 84.29% on RAF-DB, and 64.66% on
FER-2013. The results show how adaptive our model is and how it may be used to
develop end-to-end emotion recognition systems in practical settings.

Conclusion: 该方法通过MLLM增强的语义理解和软标签训练，有效提升了多模态嵌入模型的判别能力和性能。

Abstract: Universal multimodal embedding models are foundational to various tasks.
Existing approaches typically employ in-batch negative mining by measuring the
similarity of query-candidate pairs. However, these methods often struggle to
capture subtle semantic differences among candidates and lack diversity in
negative samples. Moreover, the embeddings exhibit limited discriminative
ability in distinguishing false and hard negatives. In this paper, we leverage
the advanced understanding capabilities of MLLMs to enhance representation
learning and present a novel Universal Multimodal Embedding (UniME-V2) model.
Our approach first constructs a potential hard negative set through global
retrieval. We then introduce the MLLM-as-a-Judge mechanism, which utilizes
MLLMs to assess the semantic alignment of query-candidate pairs and generate
soft semantic matching scores. These scores serve as a foundation for hard
negative mining, mitigating the impact of false negatives and enabling the
identification of diverse, high-quality hard negatives. Furthermore, the
semantic matching scores are used as soft labels to mitigate the rigid
one-to-one mapping constraint. By aligning the similarity matrix with the soft
semantic matching score matrix, the model learns semantic distinctions among
candidates, significantly enhancing its discriminative capacity. To further
improve performance, we propose UniME-V2-Reranker, a reranking model trained on
our mined hard negatives through a joint pairwise and listwise optimization
approach. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the MMEB benchmark and
multiple retrieval tasks, demonstrating that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on average across all tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决增量学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，特别是在复杂情绪识别任务中，当学习新任务时容易忘记旧任务的知识。

Method: 使用面部动作单元作为非瞬态、高语义特征，这些特征在任务间具有稳定性，优于浅层和深度卷积神经网络提取的特征。

Result: 在CFEE数据集上实现复杂复合情绪识别的准确率达到0.75，模型轻量且内存占用小，与最先进方法相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 面部动作单元是增量情绪识别中的有效特征，能够实现类似人类的学习过程，从基础情绪逐步学习复杂情绪。

Abstract: Incremental learning is a complex process due to potential catastrophic
forgetting of old tasks when learning new ones. This is mainly due to transient
features that do not fit from task to task. In this paper, we focus on complex
emotion recognition. First, we learn basic emotions and then, incrementally,
like humans, complex emotions. We show that Action Units, describing facial
muscle movements, are non-transient, highly semantical features that outperform
those extracted by both shallow and deep convolutional neural networks. Thanks
to this ability, our approach achieves interesting results when learning
incrementally complex, compound emotions with an accuracy of 0.75 on the CFEE
dataset and can be favorably compared to state-of-the-art results. Moreover, it
results in a lightweight model with a small memory footprint.

TL;DR: 提出了一种神经参数化3D乳房形状模型和基于该模型的低成本3D表面重建流程，能够从单目RGB视频中恢复准确的乳房几何形状，无需专用硬件或专有软件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有3D乳房扫描解决方案成本高昂且需要专用设备的问题，提供一种低成本、易获取的替代方案。

Method: 结合最先进的结构运动重建流程和参数化乳房模型，使用局部神经符号距离函数分解乳房区域进行建模。

Result: 重建质量显著优于现有方法，误差小于2毫米，处理时间少于6分钟。

Conclusion: 该方法能够从RGB视频中高质量重建3D乳房几何形状，具有低成本、开源和易获取的优势。

Abstract: We present a neural parametric 3D breast shape model and, based on this
model, introduce a low-cost and accessible 3D surface reconstruction pipeline
capable of recovering accurate breast geometry from a monocular RGB video. In
contrast to widely used, commercially available yet prohibitively expensive 3D
breast scanning solutions and existing low-cost alternatives, our method
requires neither specialized hardware nor proprietary software and can be used
with any device that is able to record RGB videos. The key building blocks of
our pipeline are a state-of-the-art, off-the-shelf Structure-from-motion
pipeline, paired with a parametric breast model for robust and metrically
correct surface reconstruction. Our model, similarly to the recently proposed
implicit Regensburg Breast Shape Model (iRBSM), leverages implicit neural
representations to model breast shapes. However, unlike the iRBSM, which
employs a single global neural signed distance function (SDF), our approach --
inspired by recent state-of-the-art face models -- decomposes the implicit
breast domain into multiple smaller regions, each represented by a local neural
SDF anchored at anatomical landmark positions. When incorporated into our
surface reconstruction pipeline, the proposed model, dubbed liRBSM (short for
localized iRBSM), significantly outperforms the iRBSM in terms of
reconstruction quality, yielding more detailed surface reconstruction than its
global counterpart. Overall, we find that the introduced pipeline is able to
recover high-quality 3D breast geometry within an error margin of less than 2
mm. Our method is fast (requires less than six minutes), fully transparent and
open-source, and -- together with the model -- publicly available at
https://rbsm.re-mic.de/local-implicit.

TL;DR: 该研究通过基于代理的流式基准测试，揭示了跨文化构成和渐进模糊如何影响面部表情识别的鲁棒性，发现不同文化群体在模糊条件下的性能退化模式存在明显差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有面部表情识别评估通常假设同质数据和高质量图像，但实际应用中需要应对文化差异和视觉条件退化的情况，因此需要研究跨文化构成和感知退化如何共同影响识别鲁棒性。

Method: 采用基于代理的流式基准测试，每个代理在冻结的CLIP特征空间中运行，使用轻量级残差适配器在线训练。代理在5x5网格上移动交互，环境提供按sigma调度的Gaussian模糊输入。研究了单一文化群体和混合文化环境的不同构成比例。

Result: 结果显示文化群体间存在不对称的退化曲线：JAFFE（亚洲）群体在低模糊度下保持较高性能但在中间阶段急剧下降，而KDEF（西方）群体退化更均匀。混合群体呈现中间模式，平衡混合缓解早期退化，但不平衡设置在高模糊度下放大了多数群体的弱点。

Conclusion: 研究量化了文化构成和交互结构如何影响面部表情识别在感知条件恶化时的鲁棒性，为开发更稳健的跨文化面部表情识别系统提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) must remain robust under both cultural
variation and perceptually degraded visual conditions, yet most existing
evaluations assume homogeneous data and high-quality imagery. We introduce an
agent-based, streaming benchmark that reveals how cross-cultural composition
and progressive blurring interact to shape face recognition robustness. Each
agent operates in a frozen CLIP feature space with a lightweight residual
adapter trained online at sigma=0 and fixed during testing. Agents move and
interact on a 5x5 lattice, while the environment provides inputs with
sigma-scheduled Gaussian blur. We examine monocultural populations
(Western-only, Asian-only) and mixed environments with balanced (5/5) and
imbalanced (8/2, 2/8) compositions, as well as different spatial contact
structures. Results show clear asymmetric degradation curves between cultural
groups: JAFFE (Asian) populations maintain higher performance at low blur but
exhibit sharper drops at intermediate stages, whereas KDEF (Western)
populations degrade more uniformly. Mixed populations exhibit intermediate
patterns, with balanced mixtures mitigating early degradation, but imbalanced
settings amplify majority-group weaknesses under high blur. These findings
quantify how cultural composition and interaction structure influence the
robustness of FER as perceptual conditions deteriorate.

Motivation: 深度估计对自动驾驶至关重要，雷达-相机融合能在恶劣条件下提供互补的几何线索，提高鲁棒性。

Method: 提出两种知识蒸馏策略：可解释性对齐蒸馏（转移教师网络的显著性结构）和深度分布蒸馏（将深度回归重新表述为离散区间的软分类）。

Conclusion: XD-RCDepth在显著减少参数的同时保持了可比的精度，为自动驾驶提供了轻量化的深度估计解决方案。

Abstract: Depth estimation remains central to autonomous driving, and radar-camera
fusion offers robustness in adverse conditions by providing complementary
geometric cues. In this paper, we present XD-RCDepth, a lightweight
architecture that reduces the parameters by 29.7% relative to the
state-of-the-art lightweight baseline while maintaining comparable accuracy. To
preserve performance under compression and enhance interpretability, we
introduce two knowledge-distillation strategies: an explainability-aligned
distillation that transfers the teacher's saliency structure to the student,
and a depth-distribution distillation that recasts depth regression as soft
classification over discretized bins. Together, these components reduce the MAE
compared with direct training with 7.97% and deliver competitive accuracy with
real-time efficiency on nuScenes and ZJU-4DRadarCam datasets.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)-based object detection with visible (RGB) and
infrared (IR) images facilitates robust around-the-clock detection, driven by
advancements in deep learning techniques and the availability of high-quality
dataset. However, the existing dataset struggles to fully capture real-world
complexity for limited imaging conditions. To this end, we introduce a
high-diversity dataset ATR-UMOD covering varying scenarios, spanning altitudes
from 80m to 300m, angles from 0{\deg} to 75{\deg}, and all-day, all-year time
variations in rich weather and illumination conditions. Moreover, each RGB-IR
image pair is annotated with 6 condition attributes, offering valuable
high-level contextual information. To meet the challenge raised by such diverse
conditions, we propose a novel prompt-guided condition-aware dynamic fusion
(PCDF) to adaptively reassign multimodal contributions by leveraging annotated
condition cues. By encoding imaging conditions as text prompts, PCDF
effectively models the relationship between conditions and multimodal
contributions through a task-specific soft-gating transformation. A
prompt-guided condition-decoupling module further ensures the availability in
practice without condition annotations. Experiments on ATR-UMOD dataset reveal
the effectiveness of PCDF.

TL;DR: 提出AVAR-Net音频-视觉异常识别框架，结合Wav2Vec2和MobileViT提取特征，通过早期融合和MTCN建模时序依赖，在自建VAAR数据集上达到89.29%准确率。


<details>

Motivation: 现有异常识别方法仅依赖视觉数据，在遮挡、低光照等挑战性条件下不可靠，且缺乏大规模同步音频-视觉数据集阻碍了多模态异常识别的发展。

Method: AVAR-Net包含音频特征提取器(Wav2Vec2)、视频特征提取器(MobileViT)、早期融合机制和多阶段时序卷积网络(MTCN)，用于建模跨模态关系和时序依赖。

Result: 在VAAR数据集上达到89.29%准确率，在XD-Violence数据集上达到88.56%平均精度，比现有最优方法提升2.8%。

Conclusion: AVAR-Net框架具有高效性、有效性和泛化能力，VAAR数据集为多模态异常识别研究提供了有价值的基准。

Abstract: Anomaly recognition plays a vital role in surveillance, transportation,
healthcare, and public safety. However, most existing approaches rely solely on
visual data, making them unreliable under challenging conditions such as
occlusion, low illumination, and adverse weather. Moreover, the absence of
large-scale synchronized audio-visual datasets has hindered progress in
multimodal anomaly recognition. To address these limitations, this study
presents AVAR-Net, a lightweight and efficient audio-visual anomaly recognition
framework designed for real-world environments. AVAR-Net consists of four main
modules: an audio feature extractor, a video feature extractor, fusion
strategy, and a sequential pattern learning network that models cross-modal
relationships for anomaly recognition. Specifically, the Wav2Vec2 model
extracts robust temporal features from raw audio, while MobileViT captures both
local and global visual representations from video frames. An early fusion
mechanism combines these modalities, and a Multi-Stage Temporal Convolutional
Network (MTCN) model that learns long-range temporal dependencies within the
fused representation, enabling robust spatiotemporal reasoning. A novel
Visual-Audio Anomaly Recognition (VAAR) dataset, is also introduced, serving as
a medium-scale benchmark containing 3,000 real-world videos with synchronized
audio across ten diverse anomaly classes. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that AVAR-Net achieves 89.29% accuracy on VAAR and 88.56% Average Precision on
the XD-Violence dataset, improving Average Precision by 2.8% over existing
state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the effectiveness,
efficiency, and generalization capability of the proposed framework, as well as
the utility of VAAR as a benchmark for advancing multimodal anomaly recognition
research.

Motivation: 医学图像质量对早期检测、准确诊断和治疗规划至关重要，但现有图像常受噪声、伪影和低对比度等问题影响，限制了诊断潜力。需要强大的预处理、去噪算法和先进增强方法来应对这些挑战。

Method: 采用PRISMA方法的系统文献综述，分析了39项同行评审研究，调查医学图像增强的关键挑战、最新进展和评估指标。

Result: 低对比度和噪声是最频繁出现的问题；MRI和多模态成像研究最多；传统数学方法占主导地位（29/39）；图像质量评估中非参考指标占主导（共65个IQA指标，主要为非参考型）。

Conclusion: 该综述揭示了当前医学图像增强的局限性、研究空白和未来发展方向，强调了深度学习技术日益重要的作用，以及评估指标在衡量增强效果中的重要性。

Abstract: Medical image enhancement is crucial for improving the quality and
interpretability of diagnostic images, ultimately supporting early detection,
accurate diagnosis, and effective treatment planning. Despite advancements in
imaging technologies such as X-ray, CT, MRI, and ultrasound, medical images
often suffer from challenges like noise, artifacts, and low contrast, which
limit their diagnostic potential. Addressing these challenges requires robust
preprocessing, denoising algorithms, and advanced enhancement methods, with
deep learning techniques playing an increasingly significant role. This
systematic literature review, following the PRISMA approach, investigates the
key challenges, recent advancements, and evaluation metrics in medical image
enhancement. By analyzing findings from 39 peer-reviewed studies, this review
provides insights into the effectiveness of various enhancement methods across
different imaging modalities and the importance of evaluation metrics in
assessing their impact. Key issues like low contrast and noise are identified
as the most frequent, with MRI and multi-modal imaging receiving the most
attention, while specialized modalities such as histopathology, endoscopy, and
bone scintigraphy remain underexplored. Out of the 39 studies, 29 utilize
conventional mathematical methods, 9 focus on deep learning techniques, and 1
explores a hybrid approach. In terms of image quality assessment, 18 studies
employ both reference-based and non-reference-based metrics, 9 rely solely on
reference-based metrics, and 12 use only non-reference-based metrics, with a
total of 65 IQA metrics introduced, predominantly non-reference-based. This
review highlights current limitations, research gaps, and potential future
directions for advancing medical image enhancement.

TL;DR: CanvasMAR是一个新颖的视频掩码自回归模型，通过引入画布机制解决现有模型的两个主要限制：采样初期的慢启动问题和自回归过程中的误差累积问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频掩码自回归模型存在两个主要问题：1）慢启动问题——由于早期采样阶段缺乏结构化全局先验；2）空间和时间维度上的误差累积问题。

Method: 提出画布机制——对下一帧的模糊全局预测，作为掩码生成的起点；引入组合式无分类器引导，联合增强空间（画布）和时间条件；使用基于噪声的画布增强来提高鲁棒性。

Result: 在BAIR和Kinetics-600基准测试中，CanvasMAR能够以更少的自回归步骤生成高质量视频，在Kinetics-600数据集上实现了显著性能，可与基于扩散的方法相媲美。

Conclusion: CanvasMAR通过画布机制有效解决了视频掩码自回归模型的慢启动和误差累积问题，实现了更高效和连贯的视频生成。

Abstract: Masked autoregressive models (MAR) have recently emerged as a powerful
paradigm for image and video generation, combining the flexibility of masked
modeling with the potential of continuous tokenizer. However, video MAR models
suffer from two major limitations: the slow-start problem, caused by the lack
of a structured global prior at early sampling stages, and error accumulation
across the autoregression in both spatial and temporal dimensions. In this
work, we propose CanvasMAR, a novel video MAR model that mitigates these issues
by introducing a canvas mechanism--a blurred, global prediction of the next
frame, used as the starting point for masked generation. The canvas provides
global structure early in sampling, enabling faster and more coherent frame
synthesis. Furthermore, we introduce compositional classifier-free guidance
that jointly enlarges spatial (canvas) and temporal conditioning, and employ
noise-based canvas augmentation to enhance robustness. Experiments on the BAIR
and Kinetics-600 benchmarks demonstrate that CanvasMAR produces high-quality
videos with fewer autoregressive steps. Our approach achieves remarkable
performance among autoregressive models on Kinetics-600 dataset and rivals
diffusion-based methods.

<details>

Motivation: 探索DINOv2基础模型在少样本异常检测中的两个关键问题：对抗扰动的敏感性和异常分数的校准不确定性。

Method: 基于AnomalyDINO，在冻结的DINOv2特征上附加轻量级线性头来生成对抗扰动，使用FGSM攻击评估鲁棒性，并应用Platt缩放进行后验校准。

Result: 发现微小扰动能翻转特征空间中的最近邻关系导致误分类，原始异常分数校准性差，校准后验显著提高对抗样本的预测熵，降低校准误差。

Conclusion: DINOv2异常检测器存在具体漏洞，对抗鲁棒性和不确定性量化是构建可信异常检测系统的必要能力。

Abstract: Foundation models such as DINOv2 have shown strong performance in few-shot
anomaly detection, yet two key questions remain unexamined: (i) how susceptible
are these detectors to adversarial perturbations; and (ii) how well do their
anomaly scores reflect calibrated uncertainty? Building on AnomalyDINO, a
training-free deep nearest-neighbor detector over DINOv2 features, we present
one of the first systematic studies of adversarial attacks and uncertainty
estimation in this setting. To enable white-box gradient attacks while
preserving test-time behavior, we attach a lightweight linear head to frozen
DINOv2 features only for crafting perturbations. Using this heuristic, we
evaluate the impact of FGSM across the MVTec-AD and VisA datasets and observe
consistent drops in F1, AUROC, AP, and G-mean, indicating that imperceptible
perturbations can flip nearest-neighbor relations in feature space to induce
confident misclassification. Complementing robustness, we probe reliability and
find that raw anomaly scores are poorly calibrated, revealing a gap between
confidence and correctness that limits safety-critical use. As a simple, strong
baseline toward trustworthiness, we apply post-hoc Platt scaling to the anomaly
scores for uncertainty estimation. The resulting calibrated posteriors yield
significantly higher predictive entropy on adversarially perturbed inputs than
on clean ones, enabling a practical flagging mechanism for attack detection
while reducing calibration error (ECE). Our findings surface concrete
vulnerabilities in DINOv2-based few-shot anomaly detectors and establish an
evaluation protocol and baseline for robust, uncertainty-aware anomaly
detection. We argue that adversarial robustness and principled uncertainty
quantification are not optional add-ons but essential capabilities if anomaly
detection systems are to be trustworthy and ready for real-world deployment.

Conclusion: MVCustom成功解决了多视角个性化定制任务，在保持几何一致性的同时实现高质量定制效果。

Abstract: Multi-view generation with camera pose control and prompt-based customization
are both essential elements for achieving controllable generative models.
However, existing multi-view generation models do not support customization
with geometric consistency, whereas customization models lack explicit
viewpoint control, making them challenging to unify. Motivated by these gaps,
we introduce a novel task, multi-view customization, which aims to jointly
achieve multi-view camera pose control and customization. Due to the scarcity
of training data in customization, existing multi-view generation models, which
inherently rely on large-scale datasets, struggle to generalize to diverse
prompts. To address this, we propose MVCustom, a novel diffusion-based
framework explicitly designed to achieve both multi-view consistency and
customization fidelity. In the training stage, MVCustom learns the subject's
identity and geometry using a feature-field representation, incorporating the
text-to-video diffusion backbone enhanced with dense spatio-temporal attention,
which leverages temporal coherence for multi-view consistency. In the inference
stage, we introduce two novel techniques: depth-aware feature rendering
explicitly enforces geometric consistency, and consistent-aware latent
completion ensures accurate perspective alignment of the customized subject and
surrounding backgrounds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVCustom is the
only framework that simultaneously achieves faithful multi-view generation and
customization.

Conclusion: 所提出的框架能够生成结构一致的高质量图像，有效减少伪影并确保真实的细节恢复。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently achieved significant success in various image
manipulation tasks, including image super-resolution and perceptual quality
enhancement. Pretrained text-to-image models, such as Stable Diffusion, have
exhibited strong capabilities in synthesizing realistic image content, which
makes them particularly attractive for addressing super-resolution tasks. While
some existing approaches leverage these models to achieve state-of-the-art
results, they often struggle when applied to diverse and highly degraded
images, leading to noise amplification or incorrect content generation. To
address these limitations, we propose a contextually precise image
super-resolution framework that effectively maintains both local and global
pixel relationships through Local-Global Context-Aware Attention, enabling the
generation of high-quality images. Furthermore, we propose a distribution- and
perceptual-aligned conditioning mechanism in the pixel space to enhance
perceptual fidelity. This mechanism captures fine-grained pixel-level
representations while progressively preserving and refining structural
information, transitioning from local content details to the global structural
composition. During inference, our method generates high-quality images that
are structurally consistent with the original content, mitigating artifacts and
ensuring realistic detail restoration. Extensive experiments on multiple
super-resolution benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
producing high-fidelity, perceptually accurate reconstructions.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have driven remarkable progress in image
editing, yet their extension to 3D editing remains underexplored. A natural
approach is to replace the image editing modules in existing workflows with
foundation models. However, their heavy computational demands and the
restrictions and costs of closed-source APIs make plugging these models into
existing iterative editing strategies impractical. To address this limitation,
we propose EditCast3D, a pipeline that employs video generation foundation
models to propagate edits from a single first frame across the entire dataset
prior to reconstruction. While editing propagation enables dataset-level
editing via video models, its consistency remains suboptimal for 3D
reconstruction, where multi-view alignment is essential. To overcome this,
EditCast3D introduces a view selection strategy that explicitly identifies
consistent and reconstruction-friendly views and adopts feedforward
reconstruction without requiring costly refinement. In combination, the
pipeline both minimizes reliance on expensive image editing and mitigates
prompt ambiguities that arise when applying foundation models independently
across images. We evaluate EditCast3D on commonly used 3D editing datasets and
compare it against state-of-the-art 3D editing baselines, demonstrating
superior editing quality and high efficiency. These results establish
EditCast3D as a scalable and general paradigm for integrating foundation models
into 3D editing pipelines. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有的图构建方法如KNN在较大图像上计算昂贵，而SVGA等方法由于固定步长尺度可能导致过度压缩和丢失长距离连接信息。

Method: 提出对数可扩展图构建(LSGC)方法限制长距离连接数量，构建LogViG混合CNN-GNN模型，引入高分辨率分支进行多尺度特征融合。

Result: 最小模型Ti-LogViG在ImageNet-1K上达到79.9%平均top-1准确率，比Vision GNN提高1.7%，参数减少24.3%，GMACs减少35.3%。

Conclusion: 通过LSGC在ViG中利用长距离连接可以超越当前最先进的ViG性能。

Abstract: Vision graph neural networks (ViG) have demonstrated promise in vision tasks
as a competitive alternative to conventional convolutional neural nets (CNN)
and transformers (ViTs); however, common graph construction methods, such as
k-nearest neighbor (KNN), can be expensive on larger images. While methods such
as Sparse Vision Graph Attention (SVGA) have shown promise, SVGA's fixed step
scale can lead to over-squashing and missing multiple connections to gain the
same information that could be gained from a long-range link. Through this
observation, we propose a new graph construction method, Logarithmic Scalable
Graph Construction (LSGC) to enhance performance by limiting the number of
long-range links. To this end, we propose LogViG, a novel hybrid CNN-GNN model
that utilizes LSGC. Furthermore, inspired by the successes of multi-scale and
high-resolution architectures, we introduce and apply a high-resolution branch
and fuse features between our high-resolution and low-resolution branches for a
multi-scale high-resolution Vision GNN network. Extensive experiments show that
LogViG beats existing ViG, CNN, and ViT architectures in terms of accuracy,
GMACs, and parameters on image classification and semantic segmentation tasks.
Our smallest model, Ti-LogViG, achieves an average top-1 accuracy on
ImageNet-1K of 79.9% with a standard deviation of 0.2%, 1.7% higher average
accuracy than Vision GNN with a 24.3% reduction in parameters and 35.3%
reduction in GMACs. Our work shows that leveraging long-range links in graph

TL;DR: OmniGaze是一个半监督3D视线估计框架，利用大规模无标签数据解决跨域泛化问题，通过伪标签策略和奖励模型选择高质量数据，在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D视线估计方法在跨域泛化方面存在困难，主要原因是标注数据稀缺和标注数据多样性不足。

Method: 构建多样化的无标签面部图像集合，采用标准伪标签策略，设计奖励模型评估伪标签可靠性，结合视觉嵌入和多模态大语言模型生成的语义线索计算置信度分数。

Result: 在五个数据集上的域内和跨域设置中均达到最先进性能，在四个未见数据集上展现出强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: OmniGaze不仅是一个有效的视线估计方法，还可以作为可扩展的数据引擎，显著提升了3D视线估计的泛化性能。

Abstract: Current 3D gaze estimation methods struggle to generalize across diverse data
domains, primarily due to i) the scarcity of annotated datasets, and ii) the
insufficient diversity of labeled data. In this work, we present OmniGaze, a
semi-supervised framework for 3D gaze estimation, which utilizes large-scale
unlabeled data collected from diverse and unconstrained real-world environments
to mitigate domain bias and generalize gaze estimation in the wild. First, we
build a diverse collection of unlabeled facial images, varying in facial
appearances, background environments, illumination conditions, head poses, and
eye occlusions. In order to leverage unlabeled data spanning a broader
distribution, OmniGaze adopts a standard pseudo-labeling strategy and devises a
reward model to assess the reliability of pseudo labels. Beyond pseudo labels
as 3D direction vectors, the reward model also incorporates visual embeddings
extracted by an off-the-shelf visual encoder and semantic cues from gaze
perspective generated by prompting a Multimodal Large Language Model to compute
confidence scores. Then, these scores are utilized to select high-quality
pseudo labels and weight them for loss computation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that OmniGaze achieves state-of-the-art performance on five
datasets under both in-domain and cross-domain settings. Furthermore, we also
evaluate the efficacy of OmniGaze as a scalable data engine for gaze
estimation, which exhibits robust zero-shot generalization on four unseen
datasets.

TL;DR: RECODE是一个基于代码反渲染的视觉推理框架，通过将图像转换为可执行代码来实现可验证的多模态推理，显著提升了图表和几何图形的理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在结构化视觉内容（如图表、图表）推理时缺乏验证机制的问题，像素级感知无法进行精确验证。

Method: 提出RECODE框架：首先生成多个候选程序来重现输入图像，然后使用批评器选择最忠实的重建结果，并迭代优化代码，将模糊的感知任务转化为可验证的符号问题。

Result: 在CharXiv、ChartQA、Geometry3K等多个视觉推理基准测试中，RECODE显著优于不使用代码或仅使用代码进行辅助线绘制或裁剪的方法。

Conclusion: 将视觉感知基于可执行代码为更准确和可验证的多模态推理提供了新途径。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with precise reasoning for
structured visuals like charts and diagrams, as pixel-based perception lacks a
mechanism for verification. To address this, we propose to leverage derendering
-- the process of reverse-engineering visuals into executable code -- as a new
modality for verifiable visual reasoning. Specifically, we propose RECODE, an
agentic framework that first generates multiple candidate programs to reproduce
the input image. It then uses a critic to select the most faithful
reconstruction and iteratively refines the code. This process not only
transforms an ambiguous perceptual task into a verifiable, symbolic problem,
but also enables precise calculations and logical inferences later on. On
various visual reasoning benchmarks such as CharXiv, ChartQA, and Geometry3K,
RECODE significantly outperforms methods that do not leverage code or only use
code for drawing auxiliary lines or cropping. Our work demonstrates that
grounding visual perception in executable code provides a new path toward more
accurate and verifiable multimodal reasoning.

Motivation: 解决如何将现代深度学习架构适配到fMRI数据的问题，弥合fMRI与自然图像之间的模态差距。

Method: 将4D体积fMRI数据转换为2D fMRI活动平面图视频，使用视觉Transformer和时空掩码自编码器(MAE)框架在Human Connectome Project的2.3K小时fMRI数据上进行训练。

Result: 掩码fMRI建模性能随数据集规模按严格幂律缩放规律提升，下游分类基准显示模型学习到丰富表示，支持跨受试者的细粒度状态解码和跨状态的个体特征解码。

Conclusion: 这项工作是为fMRI数据构建基础模型的开放科学项目的一部分，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: A key question for adapting modern deep learning architectures to functional
MRI (fMRI) is how to represent the data for model input. To bridge the modality
gap between fMRI and natural images, we transform the 4D volumetric fMRI data
into videos of 2D fMRI activity flat maps. We train Vision Transformers on 2.3K
hours of fMRI flat map videos from the Human Connectome Project using the
spatiotemporal masked autoencoder (MAE) framework. We observe that masked fMRI
modeling performance improves with dataset size according to a strict power
scaling law. Downstream classification benchmarks show that our model learns
rich representations supporting both fine-grained state decoding across
subjects, as well as subject-specific trait decoding across changes in brain
state. This work is part of an ongoing open science project to build foundation
models for fMRI data. Our code and datasets are available at

Motivation: 开放域视觉实体识别面临固定标签集、训练中未见实体、长尾分布等挑战，需要解决有限监督、视觉歧义和语义消歧问题。

Method: 结合图像和文本描述，利用Wikidata的实体描述、类型层次和关系上下文，在概念层面抽象视觉和文本输入，通过对比学习构建共享语义空间。

Result: 在OVEN基准测试中，视觉、文本和结构化知识的结合显著提高了准确性，特别是对罕见和未见实体。最小模型在未见实体上的准确率比最先进方法提高10.5%，且模型尺寸小35倍。

Conclusion: 知识引导的对比学习框架能有效提升开放域视觉实体识别性能，特别是在零样本场景下对罕见实体的识别能力。

Abstract: Open-domain visual entity recognition aims to identify and link entities
depicted in images to a vast and evolving set of real-world concepts, such as
those found in Wikidata. Unlike conventional classification tasks with fixed
label sets, it operates under open-set conditions, where most target entities
are unseen during training and exhibit long-tail distributions. This makes the
task inherently challenging due to limited supervision, high visual ambiguity,
and the need for semantic disambiguation. In this work, we propose a
Knowledge-guided Contrastive Learning (KnowCoL) framework that combines both
images and text descriptions into a shared semantic space grounded by
structured information from Wikidata. By abstracting visual and textual inputs
to a conceptual level, the model leverages entity descriptions, type
hierarchies, and relational context to support zero-shot entity recognition. We
evaluate our approach on the OVEN benchmark, a large-scale open-domain visual
recognition dataset with Wikidata IDs as the label space. Our experiments show
that using visual, textual, and structured knowledge greatly improves accuracy,
especially for rare and unseen entities. Our smallest model improves the
accuracy on unseen entities by 10.5% compared to the state-of-the-art, despite
being 35 times smaller.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlashWorld是一个生成模型，能够从单张图像或文本提示在几秒内生成3D场景，速度比之前工作快10-100倍，同时具有更优的渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多视图导向方法生成多视图图像用于3D重建，而3D导向方法直接生成3D高斯表示但视觉质量较差。FlashWorld旨在整合两种范式的优势。

Method: 采用双模式预训练和跨模式后训练：首先预训练支持多视图导向和3D导向的双模式多视图扩散模型，然后通过跨模式蒸馏将3D导向模式的质量提升到多视图导向水平，同时减少推理所需的去噪步骤。

Result: 实验证明该方法在效率和渲染质量上均优于现有方法，实现了快速且高质量的3D场景生成。

Conclusion: FlashWorld通过创新的双模式训练策略，成功实现了快速、高质量的3D场景生成，为3D内容创作提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose FlashWorld, a generative model that produces 3D scenes from a
single image or text prompt in seconds, 10~100$\times$ faster than previous
works while possessing superior rendering quality. Our approach shifts from the
conventional multi-view-oriented (MV-oriented) paradigm, which generates
multi-view images for subsequent 3D reconstruction, to a 3D-oriented approach
where the model directly produces 3D Gaussian representations during multi-view
generation. While ensuring 3D consistency, 3D-oriented method typically suffers
poor visual quality. FlashWorld includes a dual-mode pre-training phase
followed by a cross-mode post-training phase, effectively integrating the
strengths of both paradigms. Specifically, leveraging the prior from a video
diffusion model, we first pre-train a dual-mode multi-view diffusion model,
which jointly supports MV-oriented and 3D-oriented generation modes. To bridge
the quality gap in 3D-oriented generation, we further propose a cross-mode
post-training distillation by matching distribution from consistent 3D-oriented
mode to high-quality MV-oriented mode. This not only enhances visual quality
while maintaining 3D consistency, but also reduces the required denoising steps
for inference. Also, we propose a strategy to leverage massive single-view
images and text prompts during this process to enhance the model's
generalization to out-of-distribution inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority and efficiency of our method.

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用去噪扩散桥模型（DDBMs）从病理图像生成健康反事实图像，相比传统DDPMs能更好地平衡异常移除与个体解剖特征保留。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成病理图像的健康反事实在医学成像中具有重要意义，可用于异常检测或为健康扫描设计的分析工具应用。现有方法难以有效平衡异常移除与个体特征保留。

Method: 提出使用去噪扩散桥模型（DDBMs），该模型不仅以健康图像为初始点，还以对应的合成病理图像为最终点来条件化扩散过程，将病理图像作为结构信息先验。

Result: 实验结果显示，DDBM在分割和异常检测任务上优于先前提出的扩散模型和全监督方法。

Conclusion: DDBM能够生成更匹配患者解剖结构的选择性移除病理的健康反事实图像，在医学成像应用中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Generating healthy counterfactuals from pathological images holds significant
promise in medical imaging, e.g., in anomaly detection or for application of
analysis tools that are designed for healthy scans. These counterfactuals
should represent what a patient's scan would plausibly look like in the absence
of pathology, preserving individual anatomical characteristics while modifying
only the pathological regions. Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs)
have become popular methods for generating healthy counterfactuals of pathology
data. Typically, this involves training on solely healthy data with the
assumption that a partial denoising process will be unable to model disease
regions and will instead reconstruct a closely matched healthy counterpart.
More recent methods have incorporated synthetic pathological images to better
guide the diffusion process. However, it remains challenging to guide the
generative process in a way that effectively balances the removal of anomalies
with the retention of subject-specific features. To solve this problem, we
propose a novel application of denoising diffusion bridge models (DDBMs) -
which, unlike DDPMs, condition the diffusion process not only on the initial
point (i.e., the healthy image), but also on the final point (i.e., a
corresponding synthetically generated pathological image). Treating the
pathological image as a structurally informative prior enables us to generate
counterfactuals that closely match the patient's anatomy while selectively
removing pathology. The results show that our DDBM outperforms previously
proposed diffusion models and fully supervised approaches at segmentation and
anomaly detection tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前完全开源的多模态大语言模型落后于专有模型，主要原因是监督微调数据质量存在显著差距，现有开源数据集存在广泛噪声且缺乏复杂推理数据。

Method: 引入Honey-Data-15M数据集（约1500万QA对），采用多重清洗技术和新颖的双层CoT增强策略；开发HoneyPipe数据整理流水线和DataStudio框架。

Result: 基于Honey-Data-15M训练的Bee-8B模型在完全开源MLLMs中达到新的SOTA，在某些情况下性能超过半开源模型如InternVL3.5-8B。

Conclusion: 通过专注于数据质量的原则性方法，可以开发出与半开源模型高度竞争的完全开源多模态大语言模型。

Abstract: Fully open multimodal large language models (MLLMs) currently lag behind
proprietary counterparts, primarily due to a significant gap in data quality
for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Existing open-source datasets are often
plagued by widespread noise and a critical deficit in complex reasoning data,
such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which hinders the development of advanced model
capabilities. Addressing these challenges, our work makes three primary
contributions. First, we introduce Honey-Data-15M, a new SFT dataset comprising
approximately 15 million QA pairs, processed through multiple cleaning
techniques and enhanced with a novel dual-level (short and long) CoT enrichment
strategy. Second, we introduce HoneyPipe, the data curation pipeline, and its
underlying framework DataStudio, providing the community with a transparent and
adaptable methodology for data curation that moves beyond static dataset
releases. Finally, to validate our dataset and pipeline, we train Bee-8B, an 8B
model on Honey-Data-15M. Experiments show that Bee-8B establishes a new
state-of-the-art (SOTA) for fully open MLLMs, achieving performance that is
competitive with, and in some cases surpasses, recent semi-open models such as
InternVL3.5-8B. Our work delivers to the community a suite of foundational
resources, including: the Honey-Data-15M corpus; the full-stack suite
comprising HoneyPipe and DataStudio; training recipes; an evaluation harness;
and the model weights. This effort demonstrates that a principled focus on data
quality is a key pathway to developing fully open MLLMs that are highly
competitive with their semi-open counterparts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Risk-adaptive Activation Steering (RAS)方法，通过增强对安全关键图像区域的跨模态注意力来评估查询风险，并自适应引导激活以生成安全且有帮助的响应，无需迭代输出调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI模型面临的关键挑战是在响应良性查询时提供帮助，同时拒绝恶意查询。模型容易受到嵌入有害意图的多模态查询攻击。现有方法要么需要昂贵的安全数据集训练，要么在推理时对齐会导致过度拒绝良性查询和推理速度下降。

Method: 重新制定查询以增强对安全关键图像区域的跨模态注意力，在查询级别进行准确风险评估。根据评估的风险自适应引导激活，生成安全且有帮助的响应，避免迭代输出调整的开销。

Result: 在多个多模态安全和效用基准测试上的广泛实验表明，RAS显著降低了攻击成功率，保持了一般任务性能，并提高了推理速度，优于先前的推理时防御方法。

Conclusion: RAS方法有效解决了多模态查询中的安全问题，在保持模型效用的同时提高了安全性，且不引入额外的推理开销。

Abstract: One of the key challenges of modern AI models is ensuring that they provide
helpful responses to benign queries while refusing malicious ones. But often,
the models are vulnerable to multimodal queries with harmful intent embedded in
images. One approach for safety alignment is training with extensive safety
datasets at the significant costs in both dataset curation and training.
Inference-time alignment mitigates these costs, but introduces two drawbacks:
excessive refusals from misclassified benign queries and slower inference speed
due to iterative output adjustments. To overcome these limitations, we propose
to reformulate queries to strengthen cross-modal attention to safety-critical
image regions, enabling accurate risk assessment at the query level. Using the
assessed risk, it adaptively steers activations to generate responses that are
safe and helpful without overhead from iterative output adjustments. We call
this Risk-adaptive Activation Steering (RAS). Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks on multimodal safety and utility demonstrate that the RAS
significantly reduces attack success rates, preserves general task performance,
and improves inference speed over prior inference-time defenses.

Abstract: We introduce Generative Universal Verifier, a novel concept and plugin
designed for next-generation multimodal reasoning in vision-language models and
unified multimodal models, providing the fundamental capability of reflection
and refinement on visual outcomes during the reasoning and generation process.
This work makes three main contributions: (1) We build ViVerBench, a
comprehensive benchmark spanning 16 categories of critical tasks for evaluating
visual outcomes in multimodal reasoning. Results show that existing VLMs
consistently underperform across these tasks, underscoring a substantial gap
from human-level capability in reliable visual verification. (2) We design two
automated pipelines to construct large-scale visual verification data and train
OmniVerifier-7B, the first omni-capable generative verifier trained for
universal visual verification and achieves notable gains on ViVerBench(+8.3).
Through training, we identify three atomic capabilities in visual verification
and demonstrate how they generalize and interact synergistically. (3) We
propose OmniVerifier-TTS, a sequential test-time scaling paradigm that
leverages the universal verifier to bridge image generation and editing within
unified models, enhancing the upper bound of generative ability through
iterative fine-grained optimization. Beyond generation, we extend universal
verifier to broader world-modeling interleaved reasoning scenarios.
Empirically, OmniVerifier-TTS achieves improvements on T2I-ReasonBench(+3.7),
and GenEval++(+4.3), outperforming existing parallel test-time scaling methods,
such as Best-of-N. By endowing multimodal reasoning with reliable visual
verification, OmniVerifier advances both reliable reflection during generation
and scalable test-time refinement, marking a step toward more trustworthy and
controllable next-generation reasoning systems.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一种基于U-Net骨架化和A*图连接的基线算法，用于从脑Willis环(CoW)图像中提取中心线和形态特征，并在TopCoW数据集上验证了其高精度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Willis环是大脑中关键的动脉网络，与脑血管疾病密切相关。虽然体素级分割是自动化评估的重要步骤，但完整的定量分析需要中心线表示。然而，传统骨架化技术因CoW复杂几何结构而难以提取可靠中心线，且公开可用的中心线数据集稀缺。

Method: 使用细化骨架化算法从TopCoW数据集（包含200名卒中患者的MRA和CTA图像）中提取和整理中心线图和形态特征。开发了结合U-Net骨架化和A*图连接的基线算法，并在测试集上评估解剖准确性和特征鲁棒性。

Result: 基线算法能高精度重建图拓扑结构（F1=1），参考图和预测图之间的平均欧几里得节点距离小于一个体素。段半径、长度和分叉比等特征表现出强鲁棒性，中位相对误差低于5%，皮尔逊相关系数高于0.95。

Conclusion: 基于学习的骨架化结合图连接能实现解剖学上合理的中心线提取。研究强调了超越简单体素测量、评估解剖准确性和特征鲁棒性的重要性。数据集和基线算法已发布以支持进一步方法开发和临床研究。

Abstract: The Circle of Willis (CoW) is a critical network of arteries in the brain,
often implicated in cerebrovascular pathologies. Voxel-level segmentation is an
important first step toward an automated CoW assessment, but a full
quantitative analysis requires centerline representations. However,
conventional skeletonization techniques often struggle to extract reliable
centerlines due to the CoW's complex geometry, and publicly available
centerline datasets remain scarce. To address these challenges, we used a
thinning-based skeletonization algorithm to extract and curate centerline
graphs and morphometric features from the TopCoW dataset, which includes 200
stroke patients, each imaged with MRA and CTA. The curated graphs were used to
develop a baseline algorithm for centerline and feature extraction, combining
U-Net-based skeletonization with A* graph connection. Performance was evaluated
on a held-out test set, focusing on anatomical accuracy and feature robustness.
Further, we used the extracted features to predict the frequency of fetal PCA
variants, confirm theoretical bifurcation optimality relations, and detect
subtle modality differences. The baseline algorithm consistently reconstructed
graph topology with high accuracy (F1 = 1), and the average Euclidean node
distance between reference and predicted graphs was below one voxel. Features
such as segment radius, length, and bifurcation ratios showed strong
robustness, with median relative errors below 5% and Pearson correlations above
0.95. Our results demonstrate the utility of learning-based skeletonization
combined with graph connection for anatomically plausible centerline
extraction. We emphasize the importance of going beyond simple voxel-based
measures by evaluating anatomical accuracy and feature robustness. The dataset
and baseline algorithm have been released to support further method development
and clinical research.

Result: 实验显示与真实值的高度对齐，支持可靠的多视角光场处理。

Conclusion: LiFMCR数据集填补了多相机光场配准评估的空白，为多视角光场处理提供了可靠基础。

Abstract: We present LiFMCR, a novel dataset for the registration of multiple micro
lens array (MLA)-based light field cameras. While existing light field datasets
are limited to single-camera setups and typically lack external ground truth,
LiFMCR provides synchronized image sequences from two high-resolution Raytrix
R32 plenoptic cameras, together with high-precision 6-degrees of freedom (DoF)
poses recorded by a Vicon motion capture system. This unique combination
enables rigorous evaluation of multi-camera light field registration methods.
  As a baseline, we provide two complementary registration approaches: a robust
3D transformation estimation via a RANSAC-based method using cross-view point
clouds, and a plenoptic PnP algorithm estimating extrinsic 6-DoF poses from
single light field images. Both explicitly integrate the plenoptic camera
model, enabling accurate and scalable multi-camera registration. Experiments
show strong alignment with the ground truth, supporting reliable multi-view
light field processing.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低场MRI虽然便宜、易得且安全，但分辨率低、信噪比差。合成高场MRI可以减少对昂贵采集的依赖，但现有方法存在临床保真度差距，需要保持解剖保真度和增强细粒度结构细节

Method: 提出循环自监督扩散框架，在生成过程中实施循环一致性约束来保持解剖结构。包含切片间隙感知网络通过对比学习对齐切片间不一致性，以及局部结构校正网络通过掩码和扰动补丁的自重建增强局部特征恢复

Result: 在跨场合成任务中取得最先进性能（PSNR 31.80±2.70 dB，SSIM 0.943±0.102，LPIPS 0.0864±0.0689）。相比原始低场MRI，左脑白质误差从12.1%降至2.1%，皮层从4.2%降至3.7%

Conclusion: CSS-Diff能够合成在数量上可靠且解剖结构一致的图像

Abstract: Synthesizing high-quality images from low-field MRI holds significant
potential. Low-field MRI is cheaper, more accessible, and safer, but suffers
from low resolution and poor signal-to-noise ratio. This synthesis process can
reduce reliance on costly acquisitions and expand data availability. However,
synthesizing high-field MRI still suffers from a clinical fidelity gap. There
is a need to preserve anatomical fidelity, enhance fine-grained structural
details, and bridge domain gaps in image contrast. To address these issues, we
propose a \emph{cyclic self-supervised diffusion (CSS-Diff)} framework for
high-field MRI synthesis from real low-field MRI data. Our core idea is to
reformulate diffusion-based synthesis under a cycle-consistent constraint. It
enforces anatomical preservation throughout the generative process rather than
just relying on paired pixel-level supervision. The CSS-Diff framework further
incorporates two novel processes. The slice-wise gap perception network aligns
inter-slice inconsistencies via contrastive learning. The local structure
correction network enhances local feature restoration through
self-reconstruction of masked and perturbed patches. Extensive experiments on
cross-field synthesis tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method,
achieving state-of-the-art performance (e.g., 31.80 $\pm$ 2.70 dB in PSNR,
0.943 $\pm$ 0.102 in SSIM, and 0.0864 $\pm$ 0.0689 in LPIPS). Beyond pixel-wise
fidelity, our method also preserves fine-grained anatomical structures compared
with the original low-field MRI (e.g., left cerebral white matter error drops
from 12.1$\%$ to 2.1$\%$, cortex from 4.2$\%$ to 3.7$\%$). To conclude, our
CSS-Diff can synthesize images that are both quantitatively reliable and
anatomically consistent.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniCalli是一个统一的扩散框架，用于解决中文书法计算复制的挑战，通过联合训练识别和生成任务，在保持字符结构的同时提升页面级美学质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么生成高质量的单字但忽略页面级美学（如连笔和间距），要么尝试页面合成但牺牲书法正确性。需要一种统一的方法来同时解决这两个问题。

Method: 采用统一的扩散框架，联合训练识别和生成任务。使用非对称加噪和栅格化框图提供空间先验，在合成、标注和未标注数据的混合数据集上进行训练。

Result: 模型在生成质量上达到最先进水平，具有更好的连笔连续性和布局保真度，同时识别能力也更强。框架成功扩展到其他古代文字，包括甲骨文和埃及象形文字。

Conclusion: UniCalli通过识别和生成任务的协同训练，实现了概念级抽象，在有限数据条件下提升了两项任务的性能，为书法计算复制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Computational replication of Chinese calligraphy remains challenging.
Existing methods falter, either creating high-quality isolated characters while
ignoring page-level aesthetics like ligatures and spacing, or attempting page
synthesis at the expense of calligraphic correctness. We introduce
\textbf{UniCalli}, a unified diffusion framework for column-level recognition
and generation. Training both tasks jointly is deliberate: recognition
constrains the generator to preserve character structure, while generation
provides style and layout priors. This synergy fosters concept-level
abstractions that improve both tasks, especially in limited-data regimes. We
curated a dataset of over 8,000 digitized pieces, with ~4,000 densely
annotated. UniCalli employs asymmetric noising and a rasterized box map for
spatial priors, trained on a mix of synthetic, labeled, and unlabeled data. The
model achieves state-of-the-art generative quality with superior ligature
continuity and layout fidelity, alongside stronger recognition. The framework
successfully extends to other ancient scripts, including Oracle bone
inscriptions and Egyptian hieroglyphs. Code and data can be viewed in

TL;DR: InteractiveOmni是一个开源的4B-8B参数全模态大语言模型，集成了视觉、音频编码器和语音解码器，支持多轮音视频交互，在轻量级模型中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个轻量级的全模态模型，提供全面的多模态理解和语音生成能力，支持智能的多轮音视频交互体验。

Method: 采用多阶段训练策略：先进行全模态理解预训练，然后进行语音对话和音视频交互的后训练；精心构建多轮训练数据集来增强长期对话能力。

Result: 在图像、音频、视频理解和语音生成任务中达到同类模型的最先进水平；4B模型性能接近Qwen2.5-Omni-7B，且能保持8B模型97%的性能。

Conclusion: InteractiveOmni为下一代智能交互系统提供了一个可访问的开源基础，在长期记忆和多轮交互方面表现突出。

Abstract: We introduce InteractiveOmni, a unified and open-source omni-modal large
language model for audio-visual multi-turn interaction, ranging from 4B to 8B
parameters, designed to lead the field of lightweight models by offering
comprehensive omni-modal understanding and speech generation capabilities. To
achieve this, we integrate the vision encoder, audio encoder, large language
model, and speech decoder into a unified model for understanding and generation
tasks. We design a multi-stage training strategy to ensure robust cross-modal
capabilities, including pre-training for omni-modal understanding, followed by
post-training with speech conversation and audio-visual interaction. To enable
human-like long-term conversational ability, we meticulously curate a
multi-turn training dataset that enhances the model's ability to handle complex
and multi-turn interactions. To effectively evaluate the multi-turn memory and
speech interaction capabilities, we construct the multi-modal multi-turn memory
benchmark and the multi-turn speech interaction benchmark. Experiments
demonstrate that InteractiveOmni significantly outperforms leading open-source
models and provides a more intelligent multi-turn audio-visual experience,
particularly in its long-term memory capabilities. Notably, InteractiveOmni-4B
is comparable to the much larger model like Qwen2.5-Omni-7B on general
benchmarks, and it can retain 97% of the performance of the InteractiveOmni-8B
while utilizing only 50% of the model size. Achieving state-of-the-art results
against similarly sized models across image, audio, video understanding, and
speech generation tasks, InteractiveOmni is an accessible, open-source
foundation for next-generation intelligent interactive systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Uni-MMMU基准测试，用于评估统一多模态模型中视觉理解和生成能力的双向协同作用，涵盖科学、编程、数学等8个推理领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试很少真正检验视觉理解和生成能力的整合，要么孤立评估这两种能力，要么忽视它们内在耦合的任务。

Method: 创建包含可验证中间推理步骤、独特真实值和可重复评分协议的综合性基准测试，每个任务都双向耦合，要求模型利用概念理解指导视觉合成，或利用生成作为分析推理的认知支架。

Result: 通过对最先进的统一模型、仅生成模型和仅理解模型的广泛评估，揭示了显著的性能差距和跨模态依赖性。

Conclusion: 该基准测试为理解视觉理解和生成能力何时以及如何相互增强提供了新见解，并为推进统一模型建立了可靠基础。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models aim to jointly enable visual understanding and
generation, yet current benchmarks rarely examine their true integration.
Existing evaluations either treat the two abilities in isolation or overlook
tasks that inherently couple them. To address this gap, we present Uni-MMMU, a
comprehensive and discipline-aware benchmark that systematically unfolds the
bidirectional synergy between generation and understanding across eight
reasoning-centric domains, including science, coding, mathematics, and puzzles.
Each task is bidirectionally coupled, demanding models to (i) leverage
conceptual understanding to guide precise visual synthesis, or (ii) utilize
generation as a cognitive scaffold for analytical reasoning. Uni-MMMU
incorporates verifiable intermediate reasoning steps, unique ground truths, and
a reproducible scoring protocol for both textual and visual outputs. Through
extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art unified, generation-only, and
understanding-only models, we reveal substantial performance disparities and
cross-modal dependencies, offering new insights into when and how these
abilities reinforce one another, and establishing a reliable foundation for
advancing unified models.

*Seyed Mohammad Mousavi,Morteza Analoui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了AVC框架，用于基于扩散模型的故事延续，通过自适应视觉条件机制有效利用先前的视觉上下文，同时保持与当前文本输入的语义对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决故事延续中有效利用先前视觉上下文并确保与当前文本输入语义对齐的核心挑战。

Method: 使用CLIP模型检索先前帧中最语义对齐的图像，当没有足够相关图像时，自适应限制先前视觉对扩散过程早期阶段的影响。通过大语言模型重新标注噪声数据集来改进数据质量。

Result: 定量结果和人工评估表明，AVC在连贯性、语义一致性和视觉保真度方面优于强基线，特别是在先前视觉与当前输入冲突的挑战性情况下。

Conclusion: AVC框架能够有效利用视觉上下文，同时避免注入误导性或无关信息，在故事延续任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Story continuation focuses on generating the next image in a narrative
sequence so that it remains coherent with both the ongoing text description and
the previously observed images. A central challenge in this setting lies in
utilizing prior visual context effectively, while ensuring semantic alignment
with the current textual input. In this work, we introduce AVC (Adaptive Visual
Conditioning), a framework for diffusion-based story continuation. AVC employs
the CLIP model to retrieve the most semantically aligned image from previous
frames. Crucially, when no sufficiently relevant image is found, AVC adaptively
restricts the influence of prior visuals to only the early stages of the
diffusion process. This enables the model to exploit visual context when
beneficial, while avoiding the injection of misleading or irrelevant
information. Furthermore, we improve data quality by re-captioning a noisy
dataset using large language models, thereby strengthening textual supervision
and semantic alignment. Quantitative results and human evaluations demonstrate
that AVC achieves superior coherence, semantic consistency, and visual fidelity
compared to strong baselines, particularly in challenging cases where prior
visuals conflict with the current input.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NoisePrints是一种轻量级水印方案，利用扩散过程的随机种子作为作者证明，无需修改生成过程或访问模型权重


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着扩散模型在视觉内容生成中的广泛应用，证明作者身份和保护版权变得至关重要，特别是当模型所有者保持模型私有时，需要第三方验证方案

Method: 通过将哈希函数集成到噪声采样过程中，利用初始噪声与生成视觉内容的高度相关性，使用随机种子作为水印，并通过零知识证明保护种子隐私

Result: 实验验证了NoisePrints在多个最先进的图像和视频扩散模型上的有效性，仅需种子和输出即可高效验证，无需模型权重

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种实用且可扩展的版权保护方案，能够抵抗各种操作攻击，同时通过保密种子增加水印移除难度

Abstract: With the rapid adoption of diffusion models for visual content generation,
proving authorship and protecting copyright have become critical. This
challenge is particularly important when model owners keep their models private
and may be unwilling or unable to handle authorship issues, making third-party
verification essential. A natural solution is to embed watermarks for later
verification. However, existing methods require access to model weights and
rely on computationally heavy procedures, rendering them impractical and
non-scalable. To address these challenges, we propose , a lightweight
watermarking scheme that utilizes the random seed used to initialize the
diffusion process as a proof of authorship without modifying the generation
process. Our key observation is that the initial noise derived from a seed is
highly correlated with the generated visual content. By incorporating a hash
function into the noise sampling process, we further ensure that recovering a
valid seed from the content is infeasible. We also show that sampling an
alternative seed that passes verification is infeasible, and demonstrate the
robustness of our method under various manipulations. Finally, we show how to
use cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs to prove ownership without revealing
the seed. By keeping the seed secret, we increase the difficulty of watermark
removal. In our experiments, we validate NoisePrints on multiple
state-of-the-art diffusion models for images and videos, demonstrating
efficient verification using only the seed and output, without requiring access
to model weights.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了GS-Reasoner，首个无需外部模块即可实现自回归3D视觉定位的3D LLM，通过双路径池化机制构建统一3D表示，显著提升空间推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D LLM缺乏能够同时捕捉语义和几何信息的统一3D表示，导致定位性能差或过度依赖外部模块，阻碍了定位与空间推理的无缝集成。

Method: 提出双路径池化机制，将几何特征与语义和位置线索紧密对齐，构建基于图像块的统一3D表示；引入GCoT数据集，包含3D边界框标注和集成定位的推理路径。

Result: GS-Reasoner在3D视觉定位上取得显著成果，无需外部模块即可达到最先进模型性能，同时显著增强了空间推理能力。

Conclusion: GS-Reasoner建立了统一自包含的3D空间推理框架，证明3D视觉定位是空间推理的基石，通过紧密集成定位与推理实现突破性进展。

Abstract: In this paper, we claim that 3D visual grounding is the cornerstone of
spatial reasoning and introduce the Grounded-Spatial Reasoner (GS-Reasoner) to
explore the effective spatial representations that bridge the gap between them.
Existing 3D LLMs suffer from the absence of a unified 3D representation capable
of jointly capturing semantic and geometric information. This deficiency is
manifested either in poor performance on grounding or in an excessive reliance
on external modules, ultimately hindering the seamless integration of grounding
and spatial reasoning. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective
dual-path pooling mechanism that tightly aligns geometric features with both
semantic and positional cues, constructing a unified image patch-based 3D
representation that encapsulates all essential information without increasing
the number of input tokens. Leveraging this holistic representation,
GS-Reasoner is the first 3D LLM that achieves autoregressive grounding entirely
without external modules while delivering performance comparable to
state-of-the-art models, establishing a unified and self-contained framework
for 3D spatial reasoning. To further bridge grounding and spatial reasoning, we
introduce the Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) dataset. This dataset is
meticulously curated to include both 3D bounding box annotations for objects
referenced in reasoning questions and step-by-step reasoning paths that
integrate grounding as a core component of the problem-solving process.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that GS-Reasoner achieves impressive results
on 3D visual grounding, which in turn significantly enhances its spatial
reasoning capabilities, leading to state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 提出Trajectory Field表示方法，将视频表示为每个像素的连续3D轨迹函数，并开发Trace Anything神经网络单次前向预测整个轨迹场。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有效的时空表示对于视频动态建模至关重要，像素作为视频的基本单元在时间上形成连续3D轨迹，是动态的原始元素。

Method: 将视频表示为轨迹场，为每个像素在每个帧中预测一组控制点参数化轨迹（B样条），通过Trace Anything神经网络单次前向传播预测整个轨迹场。

Result: 在大规模4D数据上训练，在新轨迹场估计基准上达到最先进性能，在点跟踪基准上表现有竞争力；效率显著提升；展现出目标条件操作、运动预测和时空融合等涌现能力。

Conclusion: 轨迹场表示和Trace Anything模型为视频动态建模提供了有效解决方案，在性能和效率方面均有显著优势，并展现出多种应用潜力。

Abstract: Effective spatio-temporal representation is fundamental to modeling,
understanding, and predicting dynamics in videos. The atomic unit of a video,
the pixel, traces a continuous 3D trajectory over time, serving as the
primitive element of dynamics. Based on this principle, we propose representing
any video as a Trajectory Field: a dense mapping that assigns a continuous 3D
trajectory function of time to each pixel in every frame. With this
representation, we introduce Trace Anything, a neural network that predicts the
entire trajectory field in a single feed-forward pass. Specifically, for each
pixel in each frame, our model predicts a set of control points that
parameterizes a trajectory (i.e., a B-spline), yielding its 3D position at
arbitrary query time instants. We trained the Trace Anything model on
large-scale 4D data, including data from our new platform, and our experiments
demonstrate that: (i) Trace Anything achieves state-of-the-art performance on
our new benchmark for trajectory field estimation and performs competitively on
established point-tracking benchmarks; (ii) it offers significant efficiency
gains thanks to its one-pass paradigm, without requiring iterative optimization
or auxiliary estimators; and (iii) it exhibits emergent abilities, including
goal-conditioned manipulation, motion forecasting, and spatio-temporal fusion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有领域自适应方法在微调VLM不同组件时，往往导致有限的领域特定特征学习或灾难性遗忘先前能力，需要更有效的适应策略。

Method: VisCoP方法通过向VLM的视觉编码器添加紧凑的可学习视觉探针集合，实现对领域特定的高效适应，同时最小化对预训练参数的修改。

Result: 在跨视角、跨模态和跨任务三个具有挑战性的领域自适应设置中，VisCoP始终优于现有适应策略，在目标领域获得优异性能的同时有效保留源领域知识。

Conclusion: VisCoP提供了一种有效的领域自适应方法，能够在大视觉语言模型中实现高效的领域特定适应，同时避免灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at general visual reasoning tasks
but exhibit sharp performance degradation when applied to novel domains with
substantial distribution shifts from pretraining data. Existing domain
adaptation approaches finetune different VLM components, but this often results
in limited domain-specific feature learning or catastrophic forgetting of prior
capabilities. To address these issues, we introduce Vision Contextualized
Probing (VisCoP), which augments the VLM's vision encoder with a compact set of
learnable visual probes. These probes enable efficient domain-specific
adaptation with minimal modification to pretrained parameters. We evaluate
VisCoP across three challenging domain adaptation settings-cross-view
(exocentric to egocentric), cross-modal (RGB to depth), and cross-task (human
understanding to robot control). Experiments show that VisCoP consistently
outperforms existing adaptation strategies, achieving superior performance on
target domains while effectively retaining source-domain knowledge.

TL;DR: PhysMaster通过物理表征学习和强化学习来提升视频生成模型的物理意识，使其生成更符合物理规律的视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成模型虽然能生成视觉逼真的视频，但往往违反物理定律，限制了其作为'世界模型'的能力。

Method: 基于图像到视频任务，设计PhysEncoder从输入图像中提取物理信息作为额外条件，并应用基于人类反馈的强化学习来优化物理表征。

Result: PhysMaster在简单代理任务上证明了其能力，并能泛化到广泛的物理场景中。

Conclusion: PhysMaster通过强化学习范式中的表征学习，为物理感知视频生成提供了通用且可插拔的解决方案。

Abstract: Video generation models nowadays are capable of generating visually realistic
videos, but often fail to adhere to physical laws, limiting their ability to
generate physically plausible videos and serve as ''world models''. To address
this issue, we propose PhysMaster, which captures physical knowledge as a
representation for guiding video generation models to enhance their
physics-awareness. Specifically, PhysMaster is based on the image-to-video task
where the model is expected to predict physically plausible dynamics from the
input image. Since the input image provides physical priors like relative
positions and potential interactions of objects in the scenario, we devise
PhysEncoder to encode physical information from it as an extra condition to
inject physical knowledge into the video generation process. The lack of proper
supervision on the model's physical performance beyond mere appearance
motivates PhysEncoder to apply reinforcement learning with human feedback to
physical representation learning, which leverages feedback from generation
models to optimize physical representations with Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) in an end-to-end manner. PhysMaster provides a feasible solution for
improving physics-awareness of PhysEncoder and thus of video generation,
proving its ability on a simple proxy task and generalizability to wide-ranging
physical scenarios. This implies that our PhysMaster, which unifies solutions
for various physical processes via representation learning in the reinforcement
learning paradigm, can act as a generic and plug-in solution for physics-aware
video generation and broader applications.

Method: 研究随机赢输博弈，其中n×n支付矩阵的条目是参数为p=p(n)的独立同分布伯努利随机变量。分析当p∼cn^{-a}时，不同参数范围下的算法效率。

Result: 当p∼cn^{-a}时，对于a∉{1/2,1}的所有情况，存在期望多项式时间算法。当a=1/2时，如果c≤e^{-52}2^{-8}或c≥0.977，存在高效算法。当a=1时，如果c≤0.3849或c≥log^9 n，存在期望多项式时间算法。

Conclusion: 该研究在随机赢输博弈的纳什均衡计算问题上取得了重要进展，为算法博弈论中的长期开放问题提供了部分解答，确定了在大多数参数范围内存在高效算法。

Abstract: A long-standing open problem in algorithmic game theory asks whether or not
there is a polynomial time algorithm to compute a Nash equilibrium in a random
bimatrix game. We study random win-lose games, where the entries of the
$n\times n$ payoff matrices are independent and identically distributed
(i.i.d.) Bernoulli random variables with parameter $p=p(n)$. We prove that, for
nearly all values of the parameter $p=p(n)$, there is an expected
polynomial-time algorithm to find a Nash equilibrium in a random win-lose game.
More precisely, if $p\sim cn^{-a}$ for some parameters $a,c\ge 0$, then there
is an expected polynomial-time algorithm whenever $a\not\in \{1/2, 1\}$. In
addition, if $a = 1/2$ there is an efficient algorithm if either $c \le e^{-52}
2^{-8} $ or $c\ge 0.977$. If $a=1$, then there is an expected polynomial-time
algorithm if either $c\le 0.3849$ or $c\ge \log^9 n$.

TL;DR: 本文首次证明联网自动驾驶车辆(CAVs)能够形成路由联盟，偏离用户均衡状态，为自己带来利益但损害其他用户和系统效率，这可能导致交通系统出现CAV精英阶层，威胁道路网络的公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着联网自动驾驶车辆(CAVs)的出现，车辆能够通信协作形成路由联盟，这打破了传统人类驾驶员因技术和行为限制无法形成联盟的假设，需要重新评估用户均衡的稳定性。

Method: 通过在精心设计的玩具网络示例中，展示三个自动驾驶车辆组成的'俱乐部'如何联合偏离用户均衡，实现更快到达目的地的策略。

Result: CAV联盟的形成对其他未加入联盟的用户产生负面影响，导致他们旅行时间延长，并使系统变得次优和失衡，触发适应动态。

Conclusion: 如果不加以预防，CAV运营商可能故意使交通系统偏离经典纳什均衡，为自己用户谋利而将成本转嫁给他人，这可能导致CAV精英阶层的出现，损害道路网络的公平性。

Abstract: User Equilibrium is the standard representation of the so-called routing game
in which drivers adjust their route choices to arrive at their destinations as
fast as possible. Asking whether this Equilibrium is strong or not was
meaningless for human drivers who did not form coalitions due to technical and
behavioral constraints. This is no longer the case for connected autonomous
vehicles (CAVs), which will be able to communicate and collaborate to jointly
form routing coalitions.
  We demonstrate this for the first time on a carefully designed toy-network
example, where a `club` of three autonomous vehicles jointly decides to deviate
from the user equilibrium and benefit (arrive faster). The formation of such a
club has negative consequences for other users, who are not invited to join it
and now travel longer, and for the system, making it suboptimal and
disequilibrated, which triggers adaptation dynamics.
  This discovery has profound implications for the future of our cities. We
demonstrate that, if not prevented, CAV operators may intentionally
disequilibrate traffic systems from their classic Nash equilibria, benefiting
their own users and imposing costs on others. These findings suggest the
possible emergence of an exclusive CAV elite, from which human-driven vehicles
and non-coalition members may be excluded, potentially leading to
systematically longer travel times for those outside the coalition, which would
be harmful for the equity of public road networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组合预测市场中自动化做市商(AMMs)的定价问题具有计算挑战性，特别是CLUM虽然具有恒定最坏情况损失等优势，但其定价复杂性尚未被充分研究。

Method: 通过从2-SAT模型计数问题归约证明CLUM定价的#P-难解性，并提出基于oracle的近似算法，该算法可在线性时间内处理区间证券。

Result: 证明了CLUM定价是#P-难解问题，但开发了在实际中可行的多项式时间近似算法，特别适用于金融期权设计中使用的区间证券。

Conclusion: CLUM虽然计算复杂，但通过适当的近似方法可以变得实用，这为DeFi应用中的组合预测市场提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated Market Makers (AMMs) are used to provide liquidity for
combinatorial prediction markets that would otherwise be too thinly traded.
They offer both buy and sell prices for any of the doubly exponential many
possible securities that the market can offer. The problem of setting those
prices is known to be #P-hard for the original and most well-known AMM, the
logarithmic market scoring rule (LMSR) market maker [Chen et al., 2008]. We
focus on another natural AMM, the Constant Log Utility Market Maker (CLUM).
Unlike LMSR, whose worst-case loss bound grows with the number of outcomes,
CLUM has constant worst-case loss, allowing the market to add outcomes on the
fly and even operate over countably infinite many outcomes, among other
features. Simpler versions of CLUM underpin several Decentralized Finance
(DeFi) mechanisms including the Uniswap protocol that handles billions of
dollars of cryptocurrency trades daily. We first establish the computational
complexity of the problem: we prove that pricing securities is #P-hard for
CLUM, via a reduction from the model counting 2-SAT problem. In order to make
CLUM more practically viable, we propose an approximation algorithm for pricing
securities that works with high probability. This algorithm assumes access to
an oracle capable of determining the maximum shares purchased of any one
outcome and the total number of outcomes that has that maximum amount
purchased. We then show that this oracle can be implemented in polynomial time
when restricted to interval securities, which are used in designing financial
options.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨卖家在缺乏承诺能力的情况下，如何通过行为定价歧视从混合了精明和天真买家的市场中学习并获取收入，特别关注时间范围对结果的影响。

Method: 使用两期模型分析短期互动，无限期模型分析长期互动，比较完全精明买家与混合买家群体下的策略性需求减少现象。

Result: 短期：天真买家的引入加剧了总体需求减少，损害卖家收入；长期：天真买家消除了极端需求减少，卖家能有效学习并接近承诺能力下的收入水平。

Conclusion: 时间范围是行为定价歧视效果的关键决定因素，天真买家的存在在长期中能帮助卖家克服策略性需求减少问题，实现接近最优的收入。

Abstract: This paper considers behavior-based price discrimination in the repeated sale
of a non-durable good to a single long-lived buyer, by a seller without
commitment power. We assume that there is a mixed population of forward-looking
``sophisticated'' buyers and myopic ``naive'' buyers. We investigate the impact
of these dynamics on the seller's ability to learn about the buyer and exploit
this learning for revenue. We obtain conclusions that differ dramatically with
the time horizon of the interactions. To understand short time horizons, we
analyze a two-period model, and find that the strategic demand reduction
observed with fully sophisticated buyers is robust to the introduction of naive
types. In fact, despite the inability of naive buyers to game the pricing
algorithm, their introduction can further harm the seller's revenue, due to
more intense demand reduction overall. For long horizons, we consider an
infinite-horizon model with time discounting. We find that the extreme demand
reduction predicted by previous work does not survive the introduction of naive
buyers. Instead, we observe equilibria where the seller learns meaningfully
despite the sophisticated buyers' demand reduction. We prove that for a natural
family of such equilibria, the seller's revenue is not just high, but
approximates the revenue attainable with commitment power, even when the
fraction of naive types is vanishingly small.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于比率的Shapley值方法，替代传统的加法式Shapley值，用于协作机器学习中的激励兼容和公平奖励分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决协作机器学习中激励兼容性和基于贡献的公平奖励分配问题，特别是在模型奖励（非货币性、可自由复制）的分配上。

Method: 引入比率基础的Shapley值，将标准的加法公式替换为相对贡献度量，同时保持与Sim等人相同的整体奖励框架和激励定义。

Result: 比率基础的价值函数诱导出不同的模型奖励分布，并满足与加法公式相同的激励条件（公平性、个体理性、稳定性）。

Conclusion: 提供了一个数学上严谨的加法式Shapley框架的替代方案，在贡献者之间的比例性比加法差异更有意义的场景中可能更适用。

Abstract: Collaborative machine learning enables multiple data owners to jointly train
models for improved predictive performance. However, ensuring incentive
compatibility and fair contribution-based rewards remains a critical challenge.
Prior work by Sim and colleagues (Rachel Hwee Ling Sim et al: Collaborative
machine learning with incentive-aware model rewards. In: International
conference on machine learning. PMLR. 2020, pp. 8927-8963) addressed this by
allocating model rewards, which are non-monetary and freely replicable, based
on the Shapley value of each party's data contribution, measured via
information gain. In this paper, we introduce a ratio-based Shapley value that
replaces the standard additive formulation with a relative contribution
measure. While our overall reward framework, including the incentive
definitions and model-reward setting, remains aligned with that of Sim and
colleagues, the underlying value function is fundamentally different. Our
alternative valuation induces a different distribution of model rewards and
offers a new lens through which to analyze incentive properties. We formally
define the ratio-based value and prove that it satisfies the same set of
incentive conditions as the additive formulation, including adapted versions of
fairness, individual rationality, and stability. Like the original approach,
our method faces the same fundamental trade-offs between these incentives. Our
contribution is a mathematically grounded alternative to the additive Shapley
framework, potentially better suited to contexts where proportionality among
contributors is more meaningful than additive differences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增强Vickrey瓶颈模型，引入收费机制来研究交通流中的动态路由博弈，探索收费对均衡状态的影响。

Method: 在Vickrey瓶颈模型基础上引入收费成本，考虑非原子均衡，即每个粒子选择收费和旅行时间总和最小的路径。

Result: 发现与无收费版本不同，动态均衡在成本上不唯一，且不一定能达到稳态状态。

Conclusion: 提出了计算带收费模型中稳态状态的计算方法，为理解收费机制下的交通均衡提供了理论工具。

Abstract: We study a dynamic routing game motivated by traffic flows. The base model
for an edge is the Vickrey bottleneck model. That is, edges are equipped with a
free flow transit time and a capacity. When the inflow into an edge exceeds its
capacity, a queue forms and the following particles experience a waiting time.
In this paper, we enhance the model by introducing tolls, i.e., a cost each
flow particle must pay for traversing an edge. In this setting we consider
non-atomic equilibria, which means flows over time in which every particle is
on a cheapest path, when summing up toll and travel time. We first show that
unlike in the non-tolled version of this model, dynamic equilibria are not
unique in terms of costs and do not necessarily reach a steady state. As a main
result, we provide a procedure to compute steady states in the model with
tolls.

*Pooja Kulkarni,Ruta Mehta,Vishnu V. Narayan,Tomasz Ponitka*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 研究在线公平分配问题，探讨如何在物品逐个到达时保持无嫉妒性，并分析所需的最小补贴金额。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无嫉妒分配在不可分割物品中可能不存在，已有研究通过补贴实现无嫉妒分配。本文将其扩展到在线场景，研究在线分配中如何保持无嫉妒性和控制补贴成本。

Method: 设计在线算法，分析不同估值函数类别（包括加法估值、k-demand、SPLC等）下保持无嫉妒性的可行性，并计算所需的最小补贴金额。

Result: 对于加法估值及其超类，可以设计在线算法保持无嫉妒性；但即使对于加法估值，在线场景下最小补贴可能高达Ω(mn)，远高于离线场景的O(n)。在某些特殊估值类别下可获得较小的补贴界限。

Conclusion: 在线公平分配面临比离线更严峻的挑战，补贴需求可能显著增加，但在特定估值类别下仍可实现有界补贴的在线无嫉妒分配。

Abstract: We study the problem of fairly allocating $m$ indivisible items arriving
online, among $n$ (offline) agents. Although envy-freeness has emerged as the
archetypal fairness notion, envy-free (EF) allocations need not exist with
indivisible items. To bypass this, a prominent line of research demonstrates
that there exist allocations that can be made envy-free by allowing a subsidy.
Extensive work in the offline setting has focused on finding such envy-freeable
allocations with bounded subsidy. We extend this literature to an online
setting where items arrive one at a time and must be immediately and
irrevocably allocated. Our contributions are two-fold:
  1. Maintaining EF Online: We show that envy-freeability cannot always be
preserved online when the valuations are submodular or supermodular, even with
binary marginals. In contrast, we design online algorithms that maintain
envy-freeability at every step for the class of additive valuations, and for
its superclasses including $k$-demand and SPLC valuations.
  2. Ensuring Low Subsidy: We investigate the quantity of subsidy required to
guarantee envy-freeness online. Surprisingly, even for additive valuations, the
minimum subsidy may be as large as $\Omega(mn)$, in contrast to the offline
setting, where the bound is $O(n)$. On the positive side, we identify valuation
classes where the minimum subsidy is small (i.e., does not depend on $m$),
including $k$-valued, rank-one, restricted additive, and identical valuations,
and we obtain (mostly) tight subsidy bounds for these classes.

*Aditya Ganeshan,Kurt Fleischer,Wenzel Jakob,Ariel Shamir,Daniel Ritchie,Takeo Igarashi,Maria Larsson*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出Millable Extrusion Geometry (MXG)语言来建模CNC铣削几何，通过几何共优化解决传统木工接头在CNC加工中的配合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统木工接头虽然强度高、耐用且优雅，但由于手工制作成本高、难度大，在现代工作流程中很少使用。CNC铣削提供了可扩展的替代方案，但直接铣削传统接头会产生几何偏差（如圆角内角），导致配合不良。

Method: 1) 设计MXG语言表示可铣削几何，将每个操作建模为具有工具方向和钻头半径的减法挤出体积；2) 通过表面邻近度和铣削路径约束的形式化，推导两个可微损失函数来优化接头几何。

Result: 在30个传统接头设计上评估，该方法能生成CNC兼容、紧密配合的接头，近似原始几何形状。

Conclusion: 通过重新解释传统接头以适应CNC工作流程，延续了这一传统工艺的演变，确保其在未来制造实践中的相关性。

Abstract: Traditional integral wood joints, despite their strength, durability, and
elegance, remain rare in modern workflows due to the cost and difficulty of
manual fabrication. CNC milling offers a scalable alternative, but directly
milling traditional joints often fails to produce functional results because
milling induces geometric deviations, such as rounded inner corners, that alter
the target geometries of the parts. Since joints rely on tightly fitting
surfaces, such deviations introduce gaps or overlaps that undermine fit or
block assembly. We propose to overcome this problem by (1) designing a language
that represent millable geometry, and (2) co-optimizing part geometries to
restore coupling. We introduce Millable Extrusion Geometry (MXG), a language
for representing geometry as the outcome of milling operations performed with
flat-end drill bits. MXG represents each operation as a subtractive extrusion
volume defined by a tool direction and drill radius. This parameterization
enables the modeling of artifact-free geometry under an idealized zero-radius
drill bit, matching traditional joint designs. Increasing the radius then
reveals milling-induced deviations, which compromise the integrity of the
joint. To restore coupling, we formalize tight coupling in terms of both
surface proximity and proximity constraints on the mill-bit paths associated
with mating surfaces. We then derive two tractable, differentiable losses that
enable efficient optimization of joint geometry. We evaluate our method on 30
traditional joint designs, demonstrating that it produces CNC-compatible,
tightly fitting joints that approximates the original geometry. By
reinterpreting traditional joints for CNC workflows, we continue the evolution
of this heritage craft and help ensure its relevance in future making
practices.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用智能手机的单目捕捉功能替代昂贵的工作室多相机系统，使非专业用户也能进行虚拟形象数字化。

Method: 使用静态姿势序列进行纹理重建，动态运动序列学习姿势相关变形和光照变化；采用轻量级表示方法，从网格表面提取服装网格并附加光照感知高斯模型。

Result: 在移动设备上达到120 FPS，独立VR设备上90 FPS（2K分辨率），比代表性移动引擎基线快2.7倍以上。

Conclusion: HRM²Avatar在视觉真实性和实时交互性方面优于现有最先进的单目方法。

Abstract: We present HRM$^2$Avatar, a framework for creating high-fidelity avatars from
monocular phone scans, which can be rendered and animated in real time on
mobile devices. Monocular capture with smartphones provides a low-cost
alternative to studio-grade multi-camera rigs, making avatar digitization
accessible to non-expert users. Reconstructing high-fidelity avatars from
single-view video sequences poses challenges due to limited visual and
geometric data. To address these limitations, at the data level, our method
leverages two types of data captured with smartphones: static pose sequences
for texture reconstruction and dynamic motion sequences for learning
pose-dependent deformations and lighting changes. At the representation level,
we employ a lightweight yet expressive representation to reconstruct
high-fidelity digital humans from sparse monocular data. We extract garment
meshes from monocular data to model clothing deformations effectively, and
attach illumination-aware Gaussians to the mesh surface, enabling high-fidelity
rendering and capturing pose-dependent lighting. This representation
efficiently learns high-resolution and dynamic information from monocular data,
enabling the creation of detailed avatars. At the rendering level, real-time
performance is critical for animating high-fidelity avatars in AR/VR, social
gaming, and on-device creation. Our GPU-driven rendering pipeline delivers 120
FPS on mobile devices and 90 FPS on standalone VR devices at 2K resolution,
over $2.7\times$ faster than representative mobile-engine baselines.
Experiments show that HRM$^2$Avatar delivers superior visual realism and
real-time interactivity, outperforming state-of-the-art monocular methods.

TL;DR: 提出LT-Gate脉冲神经元模型，通过双时间尺度动态和自适应门控机制解决SNN在持续学习中的稳定性-可塑性困境，在时序分类任务中实现51%准确率，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脉冲神经网络在神经形态硬件上具有能效优势，但在需要快速适应和长期记忆的持续学习任务中表现不佳，特别是面临稳定性-可塑性困境。

Method: LT-Gate模型让每个脉冲神经元并行跟踪快慢两个时间尺度的信息，通过学习的门控机制局部调整其影响，并引入方差跟踪正则化来稳定放电活动。

Result: 在时序分类基准测试中达到约51%的最终准确率，优于Hebbian持续学习基线的46%和之前SNN方法；完全兼容神经形态硬件，可利用Intel Loihi芯片特性进行片上学习。

Conclusion: 多时间尺度门控可显著增强SNN的持续学习能力，缩小脉冲网络与传统深度网络在终身学习任务上的差距。

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) promise energy-efficient artificial
intelligence on neuromorphic hardware but struggle with tasks requiring both
fast adaptation and long-term memory, especially in continual learning. We
propose Local Timescale Gating (LT-Gate), a neuron model that combines dual
time-constant dynamics with an adaptive gating mechanism. Each spiking neuron
tracks information on a fast and a slow timescale in parallel, and a learned
gate locally adjusts their influence. This design enables individual neurons to
preserve slow contextual information while responding to fast signals,
addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma. We further introduce a
variance-tracking regularization that stabilizes firing activity, inspired by
biological homeostasis. Empirically, LT-Gate yields significantly improved
accuracy and retention in sequential learning tasks: on a challenging temporal
classification benchmark it achieves about 51 percent final accuracy, compared
to about 46 percent for a recent Hebbian continual-learning baseline and lower
for prior SNN methods. Unlike approaches that require external replay or
expensive orthogonalizations, LT-Gate operates with local updates and is fully
compatible with neuromorphic hardware. In particular, it leverages features of
Intel's Loihi chip (multiple synaptic traces with different decay rates) for
on-chip learning. Our results demonstrate that multi-timescale gating can
substantially enhance continual learning in SNNs, narrowing the gap between
spiking and conventional deep networks on lifelong-learning tasks.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了时间序列大语言模型中的伪对齐问题，提出了一种名为TimeSUP的新技术来解决这一问题，显著提升了现有LLM4TS方法的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 伪对齐是许多时间序列大语言模型面临的普遍挑战，导致其性能不如线性模型或随机初始化骨干网络，但目前社区对此问题的原因讨论有限。

Method: 作者深入研究了LLM4TS中伪对齐的根本原因，将其与LLM中的锥效应联系起来，并提出了TimeSUP技术，通过增加时间序列流形以更接近语言嵌入的内在维度来缓解伪对齐问题。

Result: TimeSUP在长期预测性能上持续优于最先进的LLM4TS方法和其他轻量级基线，并且可以无缝集成到四个现有的LLM4TS流程中，显著提升预测性能。

Conclusion: 伪对齐源于预训练LLM组件中的锥效应与时间序列数据内在低维流形的相互作用，TimeSUP通过调整时间序列流形维度有效解决了这一问题，使模型能够在统一嵌入空间中保持各模态独特特征的同时学习其共性。

Abstract: Pseudo-Alignment is a pervasive challenge in many large language models for
time series (LLM4TS) models, often causing them to underperform compared to
linear models or randomly initialised backbones. However, there is limited
discussion in the community for the reasons that pseudo-alignment occurs. In
this work, we conduct a thorough investigation into the root causes of
pseudo-alignment in LLM4TS and build a connection of pseudo-alignment to the
cone effect in LLM. We demonstrate that pseudo-alignment arises from the
interplay of cone effect within pretrained LLM components and the intrinsically
low-dimensional manifold of time-series data. In addition, we also introduce
\textit{\textbf{TimeSUP}}, a novel technique designed to mitigate this issue
and improve forecast performance in existing LLM4TS approaches. TimeSUP
addresses this by increasing the time series manifold to more closely match the
intrinsic dimension of language embeddings, allowing the model to distinguish
temporal signals clearly while still capturing shared structures across
modalities. As a result, representations for time and language tokens remain
distinct yet exhibit high cosine similarity, signifying that the model
preserves each modality unique features while learning their commonalities in a
unified embedding space. Empirically, TimeSUP consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art LLM4TS methods and other lightweight baselines on long-term
forecasting performance. Furthermore, it can be seamlessly integrated into four
existing LLM4TS pipelines and delivers significant improvements in forecasting
performance.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习中的类增量学习问题，需要同时处理统计异构性、数据不确定性和任务序列扩展性，同时保护任务级隐私。

Method: 客户端使用Cardinality-Agnostic Task Encoder生成高斯分布的任务嵌入，服务器端使用2-Wasserstein距离测量任务间差距并制定Wasserstein损失来增强任务分离。

Result: 在多个流行数据集上的实证评估显示，FedGTEA实现了优越的分类性能，显著减轻了遗忘问题，持续优于现有强基线方法。

Conclusion: FedGTEA通过概率化任务嵌入和对齐，为联邦类增量学习提供了一个可扩展、通信高效且隐私保护的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for Federated Class Incremental Learning,
called Federated Gaussian Task Embedding and Alignment (FedGTEA). FedGTEA is
designed to capture task-specific knowledge and model uncertainty in a scalable
and communication-efficient manner. At the client side, the
Cardinality-Agnostic Task Encoder (CATE) produces Gaussian-distributed task
embeddings that encode task knowledge, address statistical heterogeneity, and
quantify data uncertainty. Importantly, CATE maintains a fixed parameter size
regardless of the number of tasks, which ensures scalability across long task
sequences. On the server side, FedGTEA utilizes the 2-Wasserstein distance to
measure inter-task gaps between Gaussian embeddings. We formulate the
Wasserstein loss to enforce inter-task separation. This probabilistic
formulation not only enhances representation learning but also preserves
task-level privacy by avoiding the direct transmission of latent embeddings,
aligning with the privacy constraints in federated learning. Extensive
empirical evaluations on popular datasets demonstrate that FedGTEA achieves
superior classification performance and significantly mitigates forgetting,
consistently outperforming strong existing baselines.

Method: 采用平衡传播(EP)算法在振荡器伊辛机(OIMs)上实现，将优化和学习统一到单一总能量景观的下降过程中，使用局部学习规则而无需全局反向传播。

Result: 在MNIST数据集上达到97.2±0.1%的准确率，在Fashion-MNIST数据集上达到88.0±0.1%的准确率，并且在参数量化和相位噪声等实际硬件约束下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: OIMs为神经形态学习提供了快速、节能的物理基底，表明能量基模型可以在直接执行其优化的物理硬件上实现实际应用。

Abstract: Physical systems that naturally perform energy descent offer a direct route
to accelerating machine learning. Oscillator Ising Machines (OIMs) exemplify
this idea: their GHz-frequency dynamics mirror both the optimization of
energy-based models (EBMs) and gradient descent on loss landscapes, while
intrinsic noise corresponds to Langevin dynamics - supporting sampling as well
as optimization. Equilibrium Propagation (EP) unifies these processes into
descent on a single total energy landscape, enabling local learning rules
without global backpropagation. We show that EP on OIMs achieves competitive
accuracy ($\sim 97.2 \pm 0.1 \%$ on MNIST, $\sim 88.0 \pm 0.1 \%$ on
Fashion-MNIST), while maintaining robustness under realistic hardware
constraints such as parameter quantization and phase noise. These results
establish OIMs as a fast, energy-efficient substrate for neuromorphic learning,
and suggest that EBMs - often bottlenecked by conventional processors - may
find practical realization on physical hardware whose dynamics directly perform
their optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文证明了在状态对抗性MDP中，剪枝可以收紧认证鲁棒性边界，而不会降低策略的鲁棒性，并在中等稀疏度水平下发现了性能-鲁棒性的最佳平衡点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的强化学习策略需要能够抵御对抗性扰动，而现代深度RL代理过度参数化导致成本高和脆弱性问题。虽然剪枝在监督学习中已被证明能提高鲁棒性，但其在对抗性RL中的作用尚不清楚。

Method: 开发了首个在状态对抗性MDP中剪枝认证鲁棒性的理论框架，分析了高斯和分类策略与Lipschitz网络，推导了三项遗憾分解来解耦干净任务性能、剪枝引起的性能损失和鲁棒性增益。

Result: 经验评估显示，在连续控制基准测试中，剪枝在中等稀疏度水平下始终发现可重现的"最佳点"，鲁棒性显著改善而不损害甚至有时增强干净性能。

Conclusion: 剪枝不仅是压缩工具，更是实现鲁棒RL的结构性干预手段。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies deployed in real-world environments must
remain reliable under adversarial perturbations. At the same time, modern deep
RL agents are heavily over-parameterized, raising costs and fragility concerns.
While pruning has been shown to improve robustness in supervised learning, its
role in adversarial RL remains poorly understood. We develop the first
theoretical framework for certified robustness under pruning in
state-adversarial Markov decision processes (SA-MDPs). For Gaussian and
categorical policies with Lipschitz networks, we prove that element-wise
pruning can only tighten certified robustness bounds; pruning never makes the
policy less robust. Building on this, we derive a novel three-term regret
decomposition that disentangles clean-task performance, pruning-induced
performance loss, and robustness gains, exposing a fundamental
performance--robustness frontier. Empirically, we evaluate magnitude and
micro-pruning schedules on continuous-control benchmarks with strong
policy-aware adversaries. Across tasks, pruning consistently uncovers
reproducible ``sweet spots'' at moderate sparsity levels, where robustness
improves substantially without harming - and sometimes even enhancing - clean
performance. These results position pruning not merely as a compression tool
but as a structural intervention for robust RL.

Abstract: Foundation models trained on large-scale de-identified electronic health
records (EHRs) hold promise for clinical applications. However, their capacity
to memorize patient information raises important privacy concerns. In this
work, we introduce a suite of black-box evaluation tests to assess
privacy-related memorization risks in foundation models trained on structured
EHR data. Our framework includes methods for probing memorization at both the
embedding and generative levels, and aims to distinguish between model
generalization and harmful memorization in clinically relevant settings. We
contextualize memorization in terms of its potential to compromise patient
privacy, particularly for vulnerable subgroups. We validate our approach on a
publicly available EHR foundation model and release an open-source toolkit to
facilitate reproducible and collaborative privacy assessments in healthcare AI.

Result: 在多模态MNIST扩展上达到93.2%分类准确率、91.6% F1分数和78.1%解释保真度（IoU-XAI），优于单模态和非可解释基线。消融研究表明，将可解释性与偏见感知学习相结合可增强鲁棒性和人类对齐。

Conclusion: 该工作弥合了性能、透明度和公平性之间的差距，为敏感领域中的可信AI指明了实用路径。

Abstract: Standard benchmark datasets, such as MNIST, often fail to expose latent
biases and multimodal feature complexities, limiting the trustworthiness of
deep neural networks in high-stakes applications. We propose a novel multimodal
Explainable AI (XAI) framework that unifies attention-augmented feature fusion,
Grad-CAM++-based local explanations, and a Reveal-to-Revise feedback loop for
bias detection and mitigation. Evaluated on multimodal extensions of MNIST, our
approach achieves 93.2% classification accuracy, 91.6% F1-score, and 78.1%
explanation fidelity (IoU-XAI), outperforming unimodal and non-explainable
baselines. Ablation studies demonstrate that integrating interpretability with
bias-aware learning enhances robustness and human alignment. Our work bridges
the gap between performance, transparency, and fairness, highlighting a
practical pathway for trustworthy AI in sensitive domains.

### [117] [Balancing Performance and Reject Inclusion: A Novel Confident Inlier Extrapolation Framework for Credit Scoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12967)
*Athyrson Machado Ribeiro,Marcos Medeiros Raimundo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的置信内点外推框架（CI-EX）来解决信用评分中的拒绝推断问题，通过迭代识别被拒绝客户样本分布并基于监督分类模型概率分配标签，在保持AUC竞争力的同时，在拒绝推断特定指标上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统拒绝推断方法假设被拒绝客户的行为可以从已接受客户中推断，忽略了两个群体之间可能存在的分布差异，导致盲目外推问题。

Method: CI-EX框架迭代使用异常检测模型识别被拒绝客户样本分布，基于监督分类模型的概率为最接近已接受群体分布的个体分配标签。

Result: 在两个大型真实信用数据集上的实验表明，CI-EX在拒绝推断特定指标（如Kickout和Area under the Kickout）上持续优于现有方法，同时在大多数实验中保持AUC的竞争力。

Conclusion: 拒绝推断方法通常需要在AUC和拒绝推断特定指标之间进行权衡，但提出的CI-EX框架在拒绝推断特定指标上表现优异，同时保持AUC的竞争力。

Abstract: Reject Inference (RI) methods aim to address sample bias by inferring missing
repayment data for rejected credit applicants. Traditional approaches often
assume that the behavior of rejected clients can be extrapolated from accepted
clients, despite potential distributional differences between the two
populations. To mitigate this blind extrapolation, we propose a novel Confident
Inlier Extrapolation framework (CI-EX). CI-EX iteratively identifies the
distribution of rejected client samples using an outlier detection model and
assigns labels to rejected individuals closest to the distribution of the
accepted population based on probabilities derived from a supervised
classification model. The effectiveness of our proposed framework is validated
through experiments on two large real-world credit datasets. Performance is
evaluated using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) as well as RI-specific metrics
such as Kickout and a novel metric introduced in this work, denoted as Area
under the Kickout. Our findings reveal that RI methods, including the proposed
framework, generally involve a trade-off between AUC and RI-specific metrics.
However, the proposed CI-EX framework consistently outperforms existing RI
models from the credit literature in terms of RI-specific metrics while
maintaining competitive performance in AUC across most experiments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了KL正则化在博弈论环境中的理论优势，提出了OMG和SOMG算法，在矩阵博弈和马尔可夫博弈中实现了与KL正则化强度β相关的对数级遗憾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管KL正则化在强化学习和语言模型对齐中取得了经验成功，但其在博弈论环境中的理论优势仍不清楚，需要开发可证明样本效率提升的算法。

Method: 针对矩阵博弈提出了OMG算法，基于最佳响应采样和乐观奖励；针对马尔可夫博弈提出了SOMG算法，使用最佳响应采样和超乐观奖励概念。

Result: 两种算法都实现了与T相关的对数级遗憾，该遗憾与KL正则化强度β成反比，同时保持了标准的√T遗憾。

Conclusion: KL正则化在博弈论环境中确实能带来理论上的样本效率提升，通过适当的算法设计可以实现与正则化强度相关的改进性能。

Abstract: Reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based regularization with respect to
a fixed reference policy is widely used in modern reinforcement learning to
preserve the desired traits of the reference policy and sometimes to promote
exploration (using uniform reference policy, known as entropy regularization).
Beyond serving as a mere anchor, the reference policy can also be interpreted
as encoding prior knowledge about good actions in the environment. In the
context of alignment, recent game-theoretic approaches have leveraged KL
regularization with pretrained language models as reference policies, achieving
notable empirical success in self-play methods. Despite these advances, the
theoretical benefits of KL regularization in game-theoretic settings remain
poorly understood. In this work, we develop and analyze algorithms that
provably achieve improved sample efficiency under KL regularization. We study
both two-player zero-sum Matrix games and Markov games: for Matrix games, we
propose OMG, an algorithm based on best response sampling with optimistic
bonuses, and extend this idea to Markov games through the algorithm SOMG, which
also uses best response sampling and a novel concept of superoptimistic
bonuses. Both algorithms achieve a logarithmic regret in $T$ that scales
inversely with the KL regularization strength $\beta$ in addition to the
standard $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret independent of $\beta$
which is attained in both regularized and unregularized settings

TL;DR: 本文提出使用去噪分数匹配损失作为局部内在维度(LID)估计器，该方法比现有方法更高效且可扩展，在计算和内存受限场景下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LID估计方法需要多次前向传播或梯度计算，在计算和内存受限场景下应用受限，需要开发更高效的LID估计方法。

Method: 证明LID是去噪分数匹配损失的下界，从而将去噪分数匹配损失作为LID估计器，并与隐式分数匹配损失和FLIPD方法建立联系。

Result: 在流形基准测试和Stable Diffusion 3.5上的实验表明，去噪分数匹配损失在准确性和内存占用方面优于现有方法，特别是在问题规模和量化级别增加时。

Conclusion: 去噪分数匹配损失是一种高效、可扩展的LID估计器，在计算和内存效率方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: The local intrinsic dimension (LID) of data is a fundamental quantity in
signal processing and learning theory, but quantifying the LID of
high-dimensional, complex data has been a historically challenging task. Recent
works have discovered that diffusion models capture the LID of data through the
spectra of their score estimates and through the rate of change of their
density estimates under various noise perturbations. While these methods can
accurately quantify LID, they require either many forward passes of the
diffusion model or use of gradient computation, limiting their applicability in
compute- and memory-constrained scenarios.
  We show that the LID is a lower bound on the denoising score matching loss,
motivating use of the denoising score matching loss as a LID estimator.
Moreover, we show that the equivalent implicit score matching loss also
approximates LID via the normal dimension and is closely related to a recent
LID estimator, FLIPD. Our experiments on a manifold benchmark and with Stable
Diffusion 3.5 indicate that the denoising score matching loss is a highly
competitive and scalable LID estimator, achieving superior accuracy and memory
footprint under increasing problem size and quantization level.

*Benjamin Kempinski,Tal Kachman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出使用图神经网络(GNN)来近似计算网络流博弈中的Banzhaf值，解决了传统方法在大型或动态系统中计算复杂度高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法计算Banzhaf值在超过约20个代理时变得不可行，蒙特卡洛采样方法样本复杂度高且无法在不同网络配置间迁移知识。

Method: 将问题构建为图级预测任务，使用三种GNN架构(GAT、GINE、EdgeConv)在大规模合成数据集上训练，学习从网络拓扑和控制结构中提取代理影响力的通用模式。

Result: 训练后的GNN模型实现了高保真度的Banzhaf值近似，相比精确和基于采样的方法获得数量级的速度提升，并展示了强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该工作确立了GNN作为复杂网络系统可扩展合作博弈论分析的实用工具。

Abstract: Computing the Banzhaf value in network flow games is fundamental for
quantifying agent influence in multi-agent systems, with applications ranging
from cybersecurity to infrastructure planning. However, exact computation is
intractable for systems with more than $\sim20$ agents due to exponential
complexity $\mathcal{O}(2^m)$. While Monte Carlo sampling methods provide
statistical estimates, they suffer from high sample complexity and cannot
transfer knowledge across different network configurations, making them
impractical for large-scale or dynamic systems. We present a novel
learning-based approach using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to approximate
Banzhaf values in cardinal network flow games. By framing the problem as a
graph-level prediction task, our method learns generalisable patterns of agent
influence directly from network topology and control structure. We conduct a
comprehensive empirical study comparing three state-of-the-art GNN
architectures-Graph Attention Networks (GAT), Graph Isomorphism Networks with
Edge features (GINE), and EdgeConv-on a large-scale synthetic dataset of
200,000 graphs per configuration, varying in size (20-100 nodes), agent count
(5-20), and edge probability (0.5-1.0). Our results demonstrate that trained
GNN models achieve high-fidelity Banzhaf value approximation with
order-of-magnitude speedups compared to exact and sampling-based methods. Most
significantly, we show strong zero-shot generalisation: models trained on
graphs of a specific size and topology accurately predict Banzhaf values for
entirely new networks with different structural properties, without requiring
retraining. This work establishes GNNs as a practical tool for scalable
cooperative game-theoretic analysis of complex networked systems.

TL;DR: 提出了FADE指标，通过比较未学习模型和参考模型在生成样本上的双向似然分配来评估分布相似性，解决了现有遗忘指标依赖特定参考响应的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成模型的遗忘评估指标基于参考响应或分类器输出，而非核心目标——未学习模型是否与从未见过不需要数据的模型行为无法区分。这种特定参考方法存在系统性盲点。

Method: 提出功能性对齐分布等价性(FADE)指标，通过比较未学习模型和参考模型在生成样本上的双向似然分配来测量分布相似性，捕捉整个输出分布的功能对齐。

Result: 在TOFU和UnlearnCanvas基准测试中，传统指标接近最优的方法未能实现分布等价性，许多方法在遗忘后反而与黄金标准更加疏远。

Conclusion: FADE为开发和评估真正有效的遗忘方法提供了更稳健的基础，揭示了当前评估实践的根本差距。

Abstract: Current unlearning metrics for generative models evaluate success based on
reference responses or classifier outputs rather than assessing the core
objective: whether the unlearned model behaves indistinguishably from a model
that never saw the unwanted data. This reference-specific approach creates
systematic blind spots, allowing models to appear successful while retaining
unwanted knowledge accessible through alternative prompts or attacks. We
address these limitations by proposing Functional Alignment for Distributional
Equivalence (FADE), a novel metric that measures distributional similarity
between unlearned and reference models by comparing bidirectional likelihood
assignments over generated samples. Unlike existing approaches that rely on
predetermined references, FADE captures functional alignment across the entire
output distribution, providing a principled assessment of genuine unlearning.
Our experiments on the TOFU benchmark for LLM unlearning and the UnlearnCanvas
benchmark for text-to-image diffusion model unlearning reveal that methods
achieving near-optimal scores on traditional metrics fail to achieve
distributional equivalence, with many becoming more distant from the gold
standard than before unlearning. These findings expose fundamental gaps in
current evaluation practices and demonstrate that FADE provides a more robust
foundation for developing and assessing truly effective unlearning methods.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在应对实际非高斯噪声、跨信道条件泛化能力和计算效率方面存在局限性，需要开发更鲁棒和高效的CSI预测方法。

Method: 提出混合深度学习架构CSI-4CAST，整合卷积神经网络残差、自适应校正层、ShuffleNet块和Transformer四个关键组件，有效捕捉CSI预测中的局部和长程依赖关系。

Result: CSI-4CAST在88.9%的TDD场景和43.8%的FDD场景中优于基线模型，计算量比最强基线LLM4CP减少5倍和3倍，同时建立了包含30万样本的CSI-RRG基准数据集。

Conclusion: CSI-4CAST在CSI预测精度和计算效率方面均取得显著提升，提出的CSI-RRG基准为深度学习模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力评估提供了标准化平台。

Abstract: Channel state information (CSI) prediction is a promising strategy for
ensuring reliable and efficient operation of massive multiple-input
multiple-output (mMIMO) systems by providing timely downlink (DL) CSI. While
deep learning-based methods have advanced beyond conventional model-driven and
statistical approaches, they remain limited in robustness to practical
non-Gaussian noise, generalization across diverse channel conditions, and
computational efficiency. This paper introduces CSI-4CAST, a hybrid deep
learning architecture that integrates 4 key components, i.e., Convolutional
neural network residuals, Adaptive correction layers, ShuffleNet blocks, and
Transformers, to efficiently capture both local and long-range dependencies in
CSI prediction. To enable rigorous evaluation, this work further presents a
comprehensive benchmark, CSI-RRG for Regular, Robustness and Generalization
testing, which includes more than 300,000 samples across 3,060 realistic
scenarios for both TDD and FDD systems. The dataset spans multiple channel
models, a wide range of delay spreads and user velocities, and diverse noise
types and intensity degrees. Experimental results show that CSI-4CAST achieves
superior prediction accuracy with substantially lower computational cost,
outperforming baselines in 88.9% of TDD scenarios and 43.8% of FDD scenario,
the best performance among all evaluated models, while reducing FLOPs by 5x and
3x compared to LLM4CP, the strongest baseline. In addition, evaluation over
CSI-RRG provides valuable insights into how different channel factors affect
the performance and generalization capability of deep learning models. Both the
dataset (https://huggingface.co/CSI-4CAST) and evaluation protocols
(https://github.com/AI4OPT/CSI-4CAST) are publicly released to establish a
standardized benchmark and to encourage further research on robust and
efficient CSI prediction.

Conclusion: NeuroRVQ tokenizer为基于码本的通用脑波模型建立了坚实基础，推动了神经解码、生成建模和多模态生物信号集成的发展。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) captures neural activity across multiple
temporal and spectral scales, yielding signals that are rich but complex for
representation learning. Recently, EEG foundation models trained to predict
masked signal-tokens have shown promise for learning generalizable
representations. However, their performance is hindered by their signal
tokenization modules. Existing neural tokenizers fail to preserve
high-frequency dynamics, limiting their ability to reconstruct EEG signals with
high fidelity. We introduce NeuroRVQ, a scalable Large Brainwave Model (LBM)
centered on a codebook-based tokenizer. Our tokenizer integrates: (i)
multi-scale feature extraction modules that capture the full frequency neural
spectrum; (ii) hierarchical residual vector quantization (RVQ) codebooks for
high-resolution encoding; and, (iii) an EEG signal phase- and amplitude-aware
loss function for efficient training. This design enables efficient EEG
compression while supporting accurate reconstruction across all frequency
bands, leading to robust generative masked modeling. Our empirical results
demonstrate that NeuroRVQ achieves lower reconstruction error and outperforms
existing LBMs on a variety of downstream tasks. More broadly, NeuroRVQ
tokenizer establishes a strong prior for codebook-based general-purpose
brainwave models, enabling advances in neural decoding, generative modeling and
multimodal biosignal integration.

Motivation: 当前对LLM推理能力的具体来源和机制理解不足，特别是优化推理（在约束条件下寻找极值）这种在规划、控制和资源分配中至关重要的基础抽象能力。

Method: 构建ExtremBench基准数据集，包含93个标准化的极值求解问题，源自中国数学奥林匹克竞赛的不等式练习，并对多个开源模型家族进行广泛评估。

Result: 发现LLM的极值求解推理能力与现有数学基准（如AIME25和MATH-500）的评估结果不一致，有些模型在一般数学推理上表现良好但在极值求解上较差，反之亦然。

Conclusion: 现有评估实践存在关键差距，现有基准可能无法全面捕捉数学推理能力的全谱系，需要更专门的评估工具。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) with remarkable
reasoning capabilities, particularly in mathematical domains, through
intermediate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before generating final answers.
However, the specific sources and mechanisms underlying these reasoning
capabilities remain insufficiently understood. Optimization reasoning, i.e.
finding extrema under constraints, represents a fundamental abstraction that
underpins critical applications in planning, control, resource allocation, and
prompt search. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce
ExtremBench, a benchmark dataset for solving mathematical extremal problems,
curated from inequality exercises used for Chinese Mathematical Olympiad and
transformed into $93$ standardized extrema-finding problems. We conduct
extensive evaluations across various state-of-the-art open-source model
families, including the Qwen3, GPT-OSS, and DeepSeek. Our results reveal that
LLMs' extremal-solving reasoning capabilities do not always align with those of
current mathematical benchmarks such as AIME25 and MATH-500, with some models
showing strong general mathematical reasoning but poor extremal-solving skills,
and vice versa. This discrepancy highlights a critical gap in current
evaluation practices and suggests that existing benchmarks may not
comprehensively capture the full spectrum of mathematical reasoning abilities.

Conclusion: AMORE是一个通用框架，所提出的DeepONet将成为未来CFD研究的基础，用于加速湍流燃烧模拟。

Abstract: Time integration of stiff systems is a primary source of computational cost
in combustion, hypersonics, and other reactive transport systems. This
stiffness can introduce time scales significantly smaller than those associated
with other physical processes, requiring extremely small time steps in explicit
schemes or computationally intensive implicit methods. Consequently, strategies
to alleviate challenges posed by stiffness are important. While neural
operators (DeepONets) can act as surrogates for stiff kinetics, a reliable
operator learning strategy is required to appropriately account for differences
in the error between output variables and samples. Here, we develop AMORE,
Adaptive Multi-Output Operator Network, a framework comprising an operator
capable of predicting multiple outputs and adaptive loss functions ensuring
reliable operator learning. The operator predicts all thermochemical states
from given initial conditions. We propose two adaptive loss functions within
the framework, considering each state variable's and sample's error to penalize
the loss function. We designed the trunk to automatically satisfy Partition of
Unity. To enforce unity mass-fraction constraint exactly, we propose an
invertible analytical map that transforms the $n$-dimensional species
mass-fraction vector into an ($n-1$)-dimensional space, where DeepONet training
is performed. We consider two-step training for DeepONet for multiple outputs
and extend adaptive loss functions for trunk and branch training. We
demonstrate the efficacy and applicability of our models through two examples:
the syngas (12 states) and GRI-Mech 3.0 (24 active states out of 54). The
proposed DeepONet will be a backbone for future CFD studies to accelerate
turbulent combustion simulations. AMORE is a general framework, and here, in
addition to DeepONet, we also demonstrate it for FNO.

Conclusion: 提出的多阶段强化学习算法通过精心设计的初始化策略，有效避免了局部最优问题，为单细胞扰动建模提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling cellular responses to genetic and chemical perturbations remains a
central challenge in single-cell biology. Existing data-driven framework have
advanced perturbation prediction through variational autoencoders, chemically
conditioned autoencoders, and large-scale transformer pretraining. However,
these models are prone to local optima in the nonconvex Waddington landscape of
cell fate decisions, where poor initialization can trap trajectories in
spurious lineages or implausible differentiation outcomes. While executable
gene regulatory networks complement these approaches, automated design
frameworks incorporate biological priors through multi-agent optimization. Yet,
an approach that is completely data-driven with well-designed initialization to
escape local optima and converge to a proper lineage remains elusive. In this
work, we introduce a multistage reinforcement learning algorithm tailored for
single-cell perturbation modeling. We first compute an explicit natural
gradient update using Fisher-vector products and a conjugate gradient solver,
scaled by a KL trust-region constraint to provide a safe, curvature-aware the
first step for the policy. Starting with these preconditioned parameters, we
then apply a second phase of proximal policy optimization (PPO) with clipped
surrogates, exploiting minibatch efficiency to refine the policy. We
demonstrate that this initialization substantially improves generalization on
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and Single-cell ATAC sequencing
(scATAC-seq) pertubation analysis.

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了焊接检测中的数据稀缺和信号噪声问题，为工业环境中的自动化检测提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Automated ultrasonic weld inspection remains a significant challenge in the
nondestructive evaluation (NDE) community to factors such as limited training
data (due to the complexity of curating experimental specimens or high-fidelity
simulations) and environmental volatility of many industrial settings
(resulting in the corruption of on-the-fly measurements). Thus, an end-to-end
machine learning (ML) workflow for acoustic weld inspection in realistic (i.e.,
industrial) settings has remained an elusive goal. This work addresses the
challenges of data curation and signal corruption by proposing workflow
consisting of a reduced-order modeling scheme, diffusion based distribution
alignment, and U-Net-based segmentation and inversion. A reduced-order
Helmholtz model based on Lamb wave theory is used to generate a comprehensive
dataset over varying weld heterogeneity and crack defects. The relatively
inexpensive low-order solutions provide a robust training dateset for inversion
models which are refined through a transfer learning stage using a limited set
of full 3D elastodynamic simulations. To handle out-of-distribution (OOD)
real-world measurements with varying and unpredictable noise distributions,
i.e., Laser Doppler Vibrometry scans, guided diffusion produces in-distribution
representations of OOD experimental LDV scans which are subsequently processed
by the inversion models. This integrated framework provides an end-to-end
solution for automated weld inspection on real data.

Conclusion: 信息论视角为Koopman学习提供了新思路，平衡简洁性和表达能力可获得稳定且可解释的表示，代码已开源。

Abstract: The Koopman operator provides a powerful framework for modeling dynamical
systems and has attracted growing interest from the machine learning community.
However, its infinite-dimensional nature makes identifying suitable
finite-dimensional subspaces challenging, especially for deep architectures. We
argue that these difficulties come from suboptimal representation learning,
where latent variables fail to balance expressivity and simplicity. This
tension is closely related to the information bottleneck (IB) dilemma:
constructing compressed representations that are both compact and predictive.
Rethinking Koopman learning through this lens, we demonstrate that latent
mutual information promotes simplicity, yet an overemphasis on simplicity may
cause latent space to collapse onto a few dominant modes. In contrast,
expressiveness is sustained by the von Neumann entropy, which prevents such
collapse and encourages mode diversity. This insight leads us to propose an
information-theoretic Lagrangian formulation that explicitly balances this
tradeoff. Furthermore, we propose a new algorithm based on the Lagrangian
formulation that encourages both simplicity and expressiveness, leading to a
stable and interpretable Koopman representation. Beyond quantitative
evaluations, we further visualize the learned manifolds under our
representations, observing empirical results consistent with our theoretical
predictions. Finally, we validate our approach across a diverse range of
dynamical systems, demonstrating improved performance over existing Koopman
learning methods. The implementation is publicly available at
https://github.com/Wenxuan52/InformationKoopman.

TL;DR: 开发了一个可解释的AI框架，通过结合高分辨率业务模型和理想化模型的优势，构建地球系统模拟器，显著改善了CMIP6中厄尔尼诺时空模式的模拟偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Abstract: Computer models are indispensable tools for understanding the Earth system.
While high-resolution operational models have achieved many successes, they
exhibit persistent biases, particularly in simulating extreme events and
statistical distributions. In contrast, coarse-grained idealized models isolate
fundamental processes and can be precisely calibrated to excel in
characterizing specific dynamical and statistical features. However, different
models remain siloed by disciplinary boundaries. By leveraging the
complementary strengths of models of varying complexity, we develop an
explainable AI framework for Earth system emulators. It bridges the model
hierarchy through a reconfigured latent data assimilation technique, uniquely
suited to exploit the sparse output from the idealized models. The resulting
bridging model inherits the high resolution and comprehensive variables of
operational models while achieving global accuracy enhancements through
targeted improvements from idealized models. Crucially, the mechanism of AI
provides a clear rationale for these advancements, moving beyond black-box
correction to physically insightful understanding in a computationally
efficient framework that enables effective physics-assisted digital twins and
uncertainty quantification. We demonstrate its power by significantly
correcting biases in CMIP6 simulations of El Ni\~no spatiotemporal patterns,
leveraging statistically accurate idealized models. This work also highlights
the importance of pushing idealized model development and advancing
communication between modeling communities.

Motivation: 改进SGD优化器的性能，通过加速收敛和防止过拟合来提升深度学习模型的训练效果。

Method: IAGD使用二阶牛顿插值加速梯度下降收敛，假设迭代间梯度相关；NRSGD在优化过程中引入受控噪声进行正则化。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上的比较实验显示，IAGD和NRSGD在CNN模型上优于Keras包中的经典优化器。

Conclusion: IAGD和NRSGD是SGD的两种有效改进方法，展示了在深度学习优化中的潜力。

Abstract: Based on Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), the paper introduces two
optimizers, named Interpolational Accelerating Gradient Descent (IAGD) as well
as Noise-Regularized Stochastic Gradient Descent (NRSGD). IAGD leverages
second-order Newton Interpolation to expedite the convergence process during
training, assuming relevancy in gradients between iterations. To avoid
over-fitting, NRSGD incorporates a noise regularization technique that
introduces controlled noise to the gradients during the optimization process.
Comparative experiments of this research are conducted on the CIFAR-10, and
CIFAR-100 datasets, benchmarking different CNNs(Convolutional Neural Networks)
with IAGD and NRSGD against classical optimizers in Keras Package. Results
demonstrate the potential of those two viable improvement methods in SGD,
implicating the effectiveness of the advancements.

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting, which predicts rainfall up to a few hours ahead, is
a critical tool for vulnerable communities in the Global South frequently
exposed to intense, rapidly developing storms. Timely forecasts provide a
crucial window to protect lives and livelihoods. Traditional numerical weather
prediction (NWP) methods suffer from high latency, low spatial and temporal
resolution, and significant gaps in accuracy across the world. Recent machine
learning-based nowcasting methods, common in the Global North, cannot be
extended to the Global South due to extremely sparse radar coverage. We present
Global MetNet, an operational global machine learning nowcasting model. It
leverages the Global Precipitation Mission's CORRA dataset, geostationary
satellite data, and global NWP data to predict precipitation for the next 12
hours. The model operates at a high resolution of approximately 0.05{\deg}
(~5km) spatially and 15 minutes temporally. Global MetNet significantly
outperforms industry-standard hourly forecasts and achieves significantly
higher skill, making forecasts useful over a much larger area of the world than
previously available. Our model demonstrates better skill in data-sparse
regions than even the best high-resolution NWP models achieve in the US.
Validated using ground radar and satellite data, it shows significant
improvements across key metrics like the critical success index and fractions
skill score for all precipitation rates and lead times. Crucially, our model
generates forecasts in under a minute, making it readily deployable for
real-time applications. It is already deployed for millions of users on Google
Search. This work represents a key step in reducing global disparities in
forecast quality and integrating sparse, high-resolution satellite observations
into weather forecasting.

Motivation: 传统优化理论处理固定目标函数，但时变优化在动态环境决策中日益重要。本文旨在通过时变优化视角研究流数据学习问题。

Method: 引入基于权重的结构化公式，明确捕捉流数据的时变目标函数特性。采用梯度下降更新，分析均匀权重和折扣权重两种策略。

Result: 均匀权重下跟踪误差以O(1/t)速率渐近消失，折扣权重会产生由折扣因子和每步梯度更新次数控制的非零误差下限。

Conclusion: 理论分析揭示了不同权重策略对跟踪误差的影响，数值模拟验证了理论结果，为流数据学习提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Classical optimization theory deals with fixed, time-invariant objective
functions. However, time-varying optimization has emerged as an important
subject for decision-making in dynamic environments. In this work, we study the
problem of learning from streaming data through a time-varying optimization
lens. Unlike prior works that focus on generic formulations, we introduce a
structured, \emph{weight-based} formulation that explicitly captures the
streaming-data origin of the time-varying objective, where at each time step,
an agent aims to minimize a weighted average loss over all the past data
samples. We focus on two specific weighting strategies: (1) uniform weights,
which treat all samples equally, and (2) discounted weights, which
geometrically decay the influence of older data. For both schemes, we derive
tight bounds on the ``tracking error'' (TE), defined as the deviation between
the model parameter and the time-varying optimum at a given time step, under
gradient descent (GD) updates. We show that under uniform weighting, the TE
vanishes asymptotically with a $\mathcal{O}(1/t)$ decay rate, whereas
discounted weighting incurs a nonzero error floor controlled by the discount
factor and the number of gradient updates performed at each time step. Our
theoretical findings are validated through numerical simulations.

Abstract: Finding "true" clusters in a data set is a challenging problem. Clustering
solutions obtained using different models and algorithms do not necessarily
provide compact and well-separated clusters or the optimal number of clusters.
Cluster validity indices are commonly applied to identify such clusters.
Nevertheless, these indices are typically relative, and they are used to
compare clustering algorithms or choose the parameters of a clustering
algorithm. Moreover, the success of these indices depends on the underlying
data structure. This paper introduces novel absolute cluster indices to
determine both the compactness and separability of clusters. We define a
compactness function for each cluster and a set of neighboring points for
cluster pairs. This function is utilized to determine the compactness of each
cluster and the whole cluster distribution. The set of neighboring points is
used to define the margin between clusters and the overall distribution margin.
The proposed compactness and separability indices are applied to identify the
true number of clusters. Using a number of synthetic and real-world data sets,
we demonstrate the performance of these new indices and compare them with other
widely-used cluster validity indices.

Motivation: 解决大规模多用户MISO系统中波束成形优化的计算复杂度问题，实现实时高效的波束成形设计。

Method: 采用学习优化范式，使用多层Transformer通过残差连接迭代优化信道和波束成形特征，并引入课程学习、半摊销学习和滑动窗口训练三种策略来增强训练效果。

Result: 在低到中等信噪比下优于现有基线方法，在高信噪比下接近WMMSE性能，同时推理速度显著快于迭代和在线学习方法。

Conclusion: 该无监督深度学习框架为大规模MU-MISO系统的波束成形提供了一种高效实用的解决方案，在性能和计算效率方面都表现出色。

Abstract: We develop an unsupervised deep learning framework for downlink beamforming
in large-scale MU-MISO channels. The model is trained offline, allowing
real-time inference through lightweight feedforward computations in dynamic
communication environments. Following the learning-to-optimize (L2O) paradigm,
a multi-layer Transformer iteratively refines both channel and beamformer
features via residual connections. To enhance training, three strategies are
introduced: (i) curriculum learning (CL) to improve early-stage convergence and
avoid local optima, (ii) semi-amortized learning to refine each Transformer
block with a few gradient ascent steps, and (iii) sliding-window training to
stabilize optimization by training only a subset of Transformer blocks at a
time. Extensive simulations show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing
baselines at low-to-medium SNRs and closely approaches WMMSE performance at
high SNRs, while achieving substantially faster inference than iterative and
online learning approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeepCausalMMM是一个结合深度学习、因果推理和营销科学的Python包，用于改进传统营销组合建模，能自动学习时间模式、渠道依赖关系和因果结构，并优化预算分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统营销组合建模方法依赖线性回归或贝叶斯层次模型，假设营销渠道间独立，难以捕捉复杂的时间动态和非线性饱和效应。

Method: 使用门控循环单元(GRUs)自动学习时间模式(如广告存量效应和滞后)，通过有向无环图(DAG)学习营销渠道间的统计依赖和潜在因果结构，并基于Hill方程的饱和曲线建模收益递减。

Result: 实现了数据驱动设计、多区域建模、鲁棒统计方法、全面的响应曲线分析和14+交互式可视化仪表板等关键创新功能。

Conclusion: DeepCausalMMM通过结合深度学习和因果推理，有效解决了传统营销组合建模的局限性，提供了更准确的市场影响评估和预算优化能力。

Abstract: Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) is a statistical technique used to estimate the
impact of marketing activities on business outcomes such as sales, revenue, or
customer visits. Traditional MMM approaches often rely on linear regression or
Bayesian hierarchical models that assume independence between marketing
channels and struggle to capture complex temporal dynamics and non-linear
saturation effects [@Hanssens2005; @Ng2021Bayesian].
  DeepCausalMMM is a Python package that addresses these limitations by
combining deep learning, causal inference, and advanced marketing science. The
package uses Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to automatically learn temporal
patterns such as adstock (carryover effects) and lag, while simultaneously
learning statistical dependencies and potential causal structures between
marketing channels through Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) learning
[@Zheng2018NOTEARS; @Gong2024CausalMMM]. Additionally, it implements Hill
equation-based saturation curves to model diminishing returns and optimize
budget allocation.
  Key innovations include: (1) a data-driven design where hyperparameters and
transformations (e.g., adstock decay, saturation curves) are learned or
estimated from data with sensible defaults, rather than requiring fixed
heuristics or manual specification, (2) multi-region modeling with both shared
and region-specific parameters, (3) robust statistical methods including Huber
loss and advanced regularization, (4) comprehensive response curve analysis for
understanding channel saturation, and (5) an extensive visualization suite with
14+ interactive dashboards for business insights.

Conclusion: 提出的框架在精确稀疏性和近似稀疏性之间取得平衡，为大型晶格场理论的高效采样提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Lattice field theories are fundamental testbeds for computational physics;
yet, sampling their Boltzmann distributions remains challenging due to
multimodality and long-range correlations. While normalizing flows offer a
promising alternative, their application to large lattices is often constrained
by prohibitive memory requirements and the challenge of maintaining sufficient
model expressivity. We propose sparse triangular transport maps that explicitly
exploit the conditional independence structure of the lattice graph under
periodic boundary conditions using monotone rectified neural networks (MRNN).
We introduce a comprehensive framework for triangular transport maps that
navigates the fundamental trade-off between \emph{exact sparsity} (respecting
marginal conditional independence in the target distribution) and
\emph{approximate sparsity} (computational tractability without fill-ins).
Restricting each triangular map component to a local past enables site-wise
parallel evaluation and linear time complexity in lattice size $N$, while
preserving the expressive, invertible structure. Using $\phi^4$ in two
dimensions as a controlled setting, we analyze how node labelings (orderings)
affect the sparsity and performance of triangular maps. We compare against
Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) and established flow approaches (RealNVP).

Conclusion: 掩码扩散模型不仅具有与传统推理框架相当的计算能力，而且其并行生成特性在某些问题类型上能实现显著更快的推理速度。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) for text offer a compelling alternative to
traditional autoregressive language models. Parallel generation makes them
efficient, but their computational capabilities and the limitations inherent to
their parallelism remain largely unexplored. To this end, we characterize what
types of reasoning problems MDMs can provably solve and how efficiently. We do
this by connecting MDMs to the well-understood reasoning frameworks of chain of
thought (CoT) and padded looped transformers (PLTs) in the finite-precision
log-width setting: We show that MDMs and polynomially-padded PLTs are, in fact,
equivalent in this setting, and that MDMs can solve all problems that
CoT-augmented transformers can. Moreover, we showcase classes of problems
(including regular languages) for which MDMs are inherently more efficient than
CoT transformers, where parallel generation allows for substantially faster
reasoning.

Abstract: We study the client selection problem in Federated Learning (FL) within
mobile edge computing (MEC) environments, particularly under the dependent
multi-task settings, to reduce the total time required to complete various
learning tasks. We propose CoDa-FL, a Cluster-oriented and Dependency-aware
framework designed to reduce the total required time via cluster-based client
selection and dependent task assignment. Our approach considers Earth Mover's
Distance (EMD) for client clustering based on their local data distributions to
lower computational cost and improve communication efficiency. We derive a
direct and explicit relationship between intra-cluster EMD and the number of
training rounds required for convergence, thereby simplifying the otherwise
complex process of obtaining the optimal solution. Additionally, we incorporate
a directed acyclic graph-based task scheduling mechanism to effectively manage
task dependencies. Through numerical experiments, we validate that our proposed
CoDa-FL outperforms existing benchmarks by achieving faster convergence, lower
communication and computational costs, and higher learning accuracy under
heterogeneous MEC settings.

Conclusion: 提出的随机批次dropout方法在连续时间模型中有效，具有理论保证的正则化效果，并在实践中展现出良好的运行时间和内存性能。

Abstract: We study dropout regularization in continuous-time models through the lens of
random-batch methods -- a family of stochastic sampling schemes originally
devised to reduce the computational cost of interacting particle systems. We
construct an unbiased, well-posed estimator that mimics dropout by sampling
neuron batches over time intervals of length $h$. Trajectory-wise convergence
is established with linear rate in $h$ for the expected uniform error. At the
distribution level, we establish stability for the associated continuity
equation, with total-variation error of order $h^{1/2}$ under mild moment
assumptions. During training with fixed batch sampling across epochs, a
Pontryagin-based adjoint analysis bounds deviations in the optimal cost and
control, as well as in gradient-descent iterates. On the design side, we
compare convergence rates for canonical batch sampling schemes, recover
standard Bernoulli dropout as a special case, and derive a cost--accuracy
trade-off yielding a closed-form optimal $h$. We then specialize to a
single-layer neural ODE and validate the theory on classification and flow
matching, observing the predicted rates, regularization effects, and favorable
runtime and memory profiles.

Abstract: Learning effective numerical representations, or embeddings, of programs is a
fundamental prerequisite for applying machine learning to automate and enhance
compiler optimization. Prevailing paradigms, however, present a dilemma. Static
representations, derived from source code or intermediate representation (IR),
are efficient and deterministic but offer limited insight into how a program
will behave or evolve under complex code transformations. Conversely, dynamic
representations, which rely on runtime profiling, provide profound insights
into performance bottlenecks but are often impractical for large-scale tasks
due to prohibitive overhead and inherent non-determinism. This paper transcends
this trade-off by proposing a novel quasi-dynamic framework for program
representation. The core insight is to model a program's optimization
sensitivity. We introduce the Program Behavior Spectrum, a new representation
generated by probing a program's IR with a diverse set of optimization
sequences and quantifying the resulting changes in its static features. To
effectively encode this high-dimensional, continuous spectrum, we pioneer a
compositional learning approach. Product Quantization is employed to discretize
the continuous reaction vectors into structured, compositional sub-words.
Subsequently, a multi-task Transformer model, termed PQ-BERT, is pre-trained to
learn the deep contextual grammar of these behavioral codes. Comprehensive
experiments on two representative compiler optimization tasks -- Best Pass
Prediction and -Oz Benefit Prediction -- demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art static baselines. Our code is publicly available
at https://github.com/Panhaolin2001/PREP/.

Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant
success across various applications. To achieve completeness -- that is, the
universal approximation property over the space of equivariant functions -- the
network must effectively capture the intricate multi-body interactions among
different nodes. Prior methods attain this via deeper architectures, augmented
body orders, or increased degrees of steerable features, often at high
computational cost and without polynomial-time solutions. In this work, we
present a theoretically grounded framework for constructing complete
equivariant GNNs that is both efficient and practical. We prove that a complete
equivariant GNN can be achieved through two key components: 1) a complete
scalar function, referred to as the canonical form of the geometric graph; and
2) a full-rank steerable basis set. Leveraging this finding, we propose an
efficient algorithm for constructing complete equivariant GNNs based on two
common models: EGNN and TFN. Empirical results demonstrate that our model
demonstrates superior completeness and excellent performance with only a few
layers, thereby significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining
strong practical efficacy.

Abstract: The rapid increase in multimodal data availability has sparked significant
interest in cross-modal knowledge distillation (KD) techniques, where richer
"teacher" modalities transfer information to weaker "student" modalities during
model training to improve performance. However, despite successes across
various applications, cross-modal KD does not always result in improved
outcomes, primarily due to a limited theoretical understanding that could
inform practice. To address this gap, we introduce the Cross-modal
Complementarity Hypothesis (CCH): we propose that cross-modal KD is effective
when the mutual information between teacher and student representations exceeds
the mutual information between the student representation and the labels. We

TL;DR: CleverCatch是一个知识引导的弱监督模型，通过将结构化领域知识整合到神经网络架构中，在共享嵌入空间中对齐规则和数据样本，从而改进医疗欺诈检测的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗欺诈检测面临标注数据有限、欺诈手段不断演变和医疗记录高维度的挑战。传统监督方法受限于极端标签稀缺，而纯无监督方法往往无法捕捉临床意义上的异常。

Method: 该方法在神经网络架构中整合结构化领域知识，在共享嵌入空间中对齐规则和数据样本。通过在代表合规和违规的合成数据上联合训练编码器，学习能够泛化到复杂真实数据集的软规则嵌入。

Result: 在大规模真实数据集上的实验表明，CleverCatch优于四种最先进的异常检测基线方法，AUC平均提高1.3%，召回率平均提高3.4%。消融研究进一步证实了专家规则的补充作用。

Conclusion: 将专家规则嵌入学习过程不仅能提高检测准确性，还能增加透明度，为医疗欺诈检测等高风险领域提供可解释的方法。

Abstract: Healthcare fraud detection remains a critical challenge due to limited
availability of labeled data, constantly evolving fraud tactics, and the high
dimensionality of medical records. Traditional supervised methods are
challenged by extreme label scarcity, while purely unsupervised approaches
often fail to capture clinically meaningful anomalies. In this work, we
introduce CleverCatch, a knowledge-guided weak supervision model designed to
detect fraudulent prescription behaviors with improved accuracy and
interpretability. Our approach integrates structured domain expertise into a
neural architecture that aligns rules and data samples within a shared
embedding space. By training encoders jointly on synthetic data representing
both compliance and violation, CleverCatch learns soft rule embeddings that
generalize to complex, real-world datasets. This hybrid design enables
data-driven learning to be enhanced by domain-informed constraints, bridging
the gap between expert heuristics and machine learning. Experiments on the
large-scale real-world dataset demonstrate that CleverCatch outperforms four
state-of-the-art anomaly detection baselines, yielding average improvements of
1.3\% in AUC and 3.4\% in recall. Our ablation study further highlights the
complementary role of expert rules, confirming the adaptability of the
framework. The results suggest that embedding expert rules into the learning
process not only improves detection accuracy but also increases transparency,
offering an interpretable approach for high-stakes domains such as healthcare
fraud detection.

### [144] [Performance Evaluation of Ising and QUBO Variable Encodings in Boltzmann Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13210)
*Yasushi Hasegawa,Masayuki Ohzeki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 比较Ising({-1,+1})和QUBO({0,1})编码在玻尔兹曼机学习中的表现，发现QUBO编码导致Fisher信息矩阵条件数较差，使SGD收敛更慢，而自然梯度下降因重参数化不变性在不同编码下收敛相似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同变量编码（Ising vs QUBO）如何影响玻尔兹曼机学习的信息几何和收敛动态，为变量编码和预处理提供实用指导。

Method: 在固定模型、采样器和步长的受控协议下，利用Fisher信息矩阵等于充分统计量协方差的特性，可视化模型样本的经验矩，分析两种编码的系统性差异。

Result: QUBO编码在一阶和二阶统计量间产生更大的交叉项，导致FIM出现更多小特征值方向，降低谱熵，这种病态条件解释了SGD收敛较慢的原因。

Conclusion: 对于SGD训练，Ising编码提供更各向同性的曲率和更快收敛；对于QUBO，中心化/缩放或NGD式预处理可缓解曲率病态问题。这些结果为变量编码和预处理提供了可操作的指导。

Abstract: We compare Ising ({-1,+1}) and QUBO ({0,1}) encodings for Boltzmann machine
learning under a controlled protocol that fixes the model, sampler, and step
size. Exploiting the identity that the Fisher information matrix (FIM) equals
the covariance of sufficient statistics, we visualize empirical moments from
model samples and reveal systematic, representation-dependent differences. QUBO
induces larger cross terms between first- and second-order statistics, creating
more small-eigenvalue directions in the FIM and lowering spectral entropy. This
ill-conditioning explains slower convergence under stochastic gradient descent
(SGD). In contrast, natural gradient descent (NGD)-which rescales updates by
the FIM metric-achieves similar convergence across encodings due to
reparameterization invariance. Practically, for SGD-based training, the Ising
encoding provides more isotropic curvature and faster convergence; for QUBO,
centering/scaling or NGD-style preconditioning mitigates curvature pathologies.
These results clarify how representation shapes information geometry and
finite-time learning dynamics in Boltzmann machines and yield actionable
guidelines for variable encoding and preprocessing.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于截断影响函数(TIF)的数据质量评估方法，发现偏好数据质量是模型相关的，并开发了两种简化的评分函数来改进偏好数据选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常使用外部奖励模型或现成LLM来预处理原始训练数据集以识别有价值的偏好对，但很少检查单个数据点是否真正有益。

Method: 提出截断影响函数(TIF)评估数据质量，开发两种计算更简单的评分函数(SF)，并将它们组合以抵消不同的误差源。

Result: 实验表明，使用更少的数据可以实现更好的对齐性能，证明了该方法的通用性。

Conclusion: 偏好数据质量是模型相关的，需要针对特定模型改进数据选择方法，提出的数据选择规则能够更精确地选择有价值的偏好数据。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) alignment is typically achieved through learning
from human preference comparisons, making the quality of preference data
critical to its success. Existing studies often pre-process raw training
datasets to identify valuable preference pairs using external reward models or
off-the-shelf LLMs, achieving improved overall performance but rarely examining
whether individual, selected data point is genuinely beneficial. We assess data
quality through individual influence on validation data using our newly
proposed truncated influence function (TIF), which mitigates the over-scoring
present in traditional measures and reveals that preference data quality is
inherently a property of the model. In other words, a data pair that benefits
one model may harm another. This leaves the need to improve the preference data
selection approaches to be adapting to specific models. To this end, we
introduce two candidate scoring functions (SFs) that are computationally
simpler than TIF and positively correlated with it. They are also model
dependent and can serve as potential indicators of individual data quality for
preference data selection. Furthermore, we observe that these SFs inherently
exhibit errors when compared to TIF. To this end, we combine them to offset
their diverse error sources, resulting in a simple yet effective data selection
rule that enables the models to achieve a more precise selection of valuable
preference data. We conduct experiments across diverse alignment benchmarks and
various LLM families, with results demonstrating that better alignment
performance can be achieved using less data, showing the generality of our
findings and new methods.

Motivation: 尽管Transformer在离线或基于模型的强化学习中表现出色，但在在线无模型强化学习中仍未被充分探索，主要因为其对训练设置和模型设计决策的敏感性。

Method: 研究了Transformer在在线无模型强化学习中的关键设计问题，包括输入条件设置、actor和critic之间的组件共享策略，以及序列数据的切片训练方法。

Result: 实验表明，通过稳定的架构和训练策略，Transformer在连续控制任务中能够达到有竞争力的性能，适用于完全可观测和部分可观测任务，以及向量和图像输入设置。

Conclusion: 这些发现为在在线强化学习中应用Transformer提供了实用的指导，证明了Transformer可以作为连续控制任务的强基线方法。

Abstract: Despite their effectiveness and popularity in offline or model-based
reinforcement learning (RL), transformers remain underexplored in online
model-free RL due to their sensitivity to training setups and model design
decisions such as how to structure the policy and value networks, share
components, or handle temporal information. In this paper, we show that
transformers can be strong baselines for continuous control in online
model-free RL. We investigate key design questions: how to condition inputs,
share components between actor and critic, and slice sequential data for
training. Our experiments reveal stable architectural and training strategies
enabling competitive performance across fully and partially observable tasks,
and in both vector- and image-based settings. These findings offer practical
guidance for applying transformers in online RL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GNN在域适应中表现不佳，主要原因是未能区分处理全局和局部模式，且对可迁移模式的探索不足

Method: 使用频谱分析将图分解为高低频分量，设计两个协同模块进行频率感知的域适应，并集成对比学习框架改善模糊边界问题

Result: 在广泛实验中相比最先进方法取得了显著改进

Conclusion: FracNet通过频谱分析和对比学习有效解决了图神经网络的域适应问题，并提供了理论证明

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various
domains, yet they often struggle with domain adaptation due to significant
structural distribution shifts and insufficient exploration of transferable
patterns. One of the main reasons behind this is that traditional approaches do
not treat global and local patterns discriminatingly so that some local details
in the graph may be violated after multi-layer GNN. Our key insight is that
domain shifts can be better understood through spectral analysis, where
low-frequency components often encode domain-invariant global patterns, and
high-frequency components capture domain-specific local details. As such, we
propose FracNet (\underline{\textbf{Fr}}equency \underline{\textbf{A}}ware
\underline{\textbf{C}}ontrastive Graph \underline{\textbf{Net}}work) with two
synergic modules to decompose the original graph into high-frequency and
low-frequency components and perform frequency-aware domain adaption. Moreover,
the blurring boundary problem of domain adaptation is improved by integrating
with a contrastive learning framework. Besides the practical implication, we
also provide rigorous theoretical proof to demonstrate the superiority of
FracNet. Extensive experiments further demonstrate significant improvements
over state-of-the-art approaches.

detection, while also making use of considerably fewer parameters. Our solution
is architecture-agnostic and can be applied to a wide range of base models out

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实世界中多模态数据异构性问题，现有联邦学习框架在非理想设置下效果有限，需要处理客户端间数据和模态不对称的情况。

Method: 提出BlendFL框架，结合横向和纵向联邦学习原则，支持去中心化推理，引入BlendAvg自适应全局模型聚合策略。

Result: 在三个分类任务上评估，使用大规模真实医疗数据集和基准数据集，BlendFL在多模态和单模态分类上表现优异，收敛更快。

Conclusion: BlendFL在处理多模态数据异构性方面具有潜力，特别适用于医疗和金融等需要数据隐私保护的领域。

Abstract: One of the key challenges of collaborative machine learning, without data
sharing, is multimodal data heterogeneity in real-world settings. While
Federated Learning (FL) enables model training across multiple clients,
existing frameworks, such as horizontal and vertical FL, are only effective in
`ideal' settings that meet specific assumptions. Hence, they struggle to
address scenarios where neither all modalities nor all samples are represented
across the participating clients. To address this gap, we propose BlendFL, a
novel FL framework that seamlessly blends the principles of horizontal and
vertical FL in a synchronized and non-restrictive fashion despite the asymmetry
across clients. Specifically, any client within BlendFL can benefit from either
of the approaches, or both simultaneously, according to its available dataset.
In addition, BlendFL features a decentralized inference mechanism, empowering
clients to run collaboratively trained local models using available local data,
thereby reducing latency and reliance on central servers for inference. We also
introduce BlendAvg, an adaptive global model aggregation strategy that
prioritizes collaborative model updates based on each client's performance. We
trained and evaluated BlendFL and other state-of-the-art baselines on three
classification tasks using a large-scale real-world multimodal medical dataset
and a popular multimodal benchmark. Our results highlight BlendFL's superior
performance for both multimodal and unimodal classification. Ablation studies
demonstrate BlendFL's faster convergence compared to traditional approaches,
accelerating collaborative learning. Overall, in our study we highlight the
potential of BlendFL for handling multimodal data heterogeneity for
collaborative learning in real-world settings where data privacy is crucial,
such as in healthcare and finance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖固定、手动调整的干预强度，常导致干预不足或过度，MERA旨在解决这些限制。

Method: 通过优化干预方向和校准干预时机及强度，在无法自信纠正时选择弃权，可应用于现有干预技术之上。

Result: 在多样化数据集和语言模型家族上的实验表明，MERA能安全、有效地纠正错误且不降低性能，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: MERA是一种通用且高效的机制激活干预方法，可提升现有干预技术的性能。

Abstract: We introduce Mechanistic Error Reduction with Abstention (MERA), a principled
framework for steering language models (LMs) to mitigate errors through
selective, adaptive interventions. Unlike existing methods that rely on fixed,
manually tuned steering strengths, often resulting in under or oversteering,
MERA addresses these limitations by (i) optimising the intervention direction,
and (ii) calibrating when, and how much to steer, thereby provably improving
performance or abstaining when no confident correction is possible. Experiments
across diverse datasets, and LM families demonstrate safe, effective,
non-degrading error correction, and that MERA outperforms existing baselines.
Moreover, MERA can be applied on top of existing steering techniques to further
enhance their performance, establishing it as a general-purpose, and efficient
approach to mechanistic activation steering.

Motivation: 现有的大规模环境并行化方法虽然能加速训练，但仍需要大量环境交互来达到期望性能水平。结构良好的表示可以改善深度强化学习的泛化能力和样本效率。

Method: 提出单纯形嵌入：轻量级表示层，将嵌入约束在单纯形结构中。这种几何归纳偏置产生稀疏离散特征，稳定critic引导并增强策略梯度。

Result: 在FastTD3、FastSAC和PPO算法上应用单纯形嵌入，在多种连续和离散控制环境中一致提高了样本效率和最终性能，且不损失运行速度。

Conclusion: 单纯形嵌入是一种有效的表示学习方法，能够在不牺牲速度的情况下显著提升强化学习算法的性能。

Abstract: Recent works have proposed accelerating the wall-clock training time of
actor-critic methods via the use of large-scale environment parallelization;
unfortunately, these can sometimes still require large number of environment
interactions to achieve a desired level of performance. Noting that
well-structured representations can improve the generalization and sample
efficiency of deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents, we propose the use of
simplicial embeddings: lightweight representation layers that constrain
embeddings to simplicial structures. This geometric inductive bias results in
sparse and discrete features that stabilize critic bootstrapping and strengthen
policy gradients. When applied to FastTD3, FastSAC, and PPO, simplicial
embeddings consistently improve sample efficiency and final performance across
a variety of continuous- and discrete-control environments, without any loss in
runtime speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准保形预测假设数据独立同分布，但在联邦学习中客户端数据分布差异显著，现有方法只能保证边际覆盖，无法反映输入条件不确定性。

Method: 利用生成模型（如归一化流或扩散模型）近似条件数据分布，无需共享原始数据，使每个客户端能本地校准反映其独特不确定性的保形分数，通过联邦聚合保持全局一致性。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，Fed-CCP能够实现更自适应的预测集。

Conclusion: Fed-CCP通过生成模型有效解决了联邦学习中数据异质性带来的条件覆盖问题，实现了更精确的不确定性量化。

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) provides distribution-free uncertainty
quantification by constructing prediction sets that guarantee coverage of the
true labels. This reliability makes CP valuable for high-stakes federated
learning scenarios such as multi-center healthcare. However, standard CP
assumes i.i.d. data, which is violated in federated settings where client
distributions differ substantially. Existing federated CP methods address this
by maintaining marginal coverage on each client, but such guarantees often fail
to reflect input-conditional uncertainty. In this work, we propose Federated
Conditional Conformal Prediction (Fed-CCP) via generative models, which aims
for conditional coverage that adapts to local data heterogeneity. Fed-CCP
leverages generative models, such as normalizing flows or diffusion models, to
approximate conditional data distributions without requiring the sharing of raw
data. This enables each client to locally calibrate conformal scores that
reflect its unique uncertainty, while preserving global consistency through
federated aggregation. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate that Fed-CCP
achieves more adaptive prediction sets.

Motivation: 生成扩散模型在动态降尺度中表现出色，但缺乏有限样本保证，导致网格点级不确定性估计不准确，影响在业务环境中的可靠性。

Method: 在降尺度流程中引入保形预测框架，对扩散模型的样本进行后处理得到条件分位数估计，采用保形化分位数回归方法获得具有有限样本边际有效性的局部自适应预测区间。

Result: 在意大利ERA5再分析数据上的实验表明，该方法显著改善了网格点级不确定性估计的覆盖率和概率评分稳定性。

Conclusion: 保形化生成模型为高分辨率气象场的概率降尺度提供了更可信赖的解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamical downscaling is crucial for deriving high-resolution meteorological
fields from coarse-scale simulations, enabling detailed analysis for critical
applications such as weather forecasting and renewable energy modeling.
Generative Diffusion models (DMs) have recently emerged as powerful data-driven
tools for this task, offering reconstruction fidelity and more scalable
sampling supporting uncertainty quantification. However, DMs lack finite-sample
guarantees against overconfident predictions, resulting in miscalibrated
grid-point-level uncertainty estimates hindering their reliability in
operational contexts. In this work, we tackle this issue by augmenting the
downscaling pipeline with a conformal prediction framework. Specifically, the
DM's samples are post-processed to derive conditional quantile estimates,
incorporated into a conformalized quantile regression procedure targeting
locally adaptive prediction intervals with finite-sample marginal validity. The
proposed approach is evaluated on ERA5 reanalysis data over Italy, downscaled
to a 2-km grid. Results demonstrate grid-point-level uncertainty estimates with
markedly improved coverage and stable probabilistic scores relative to the DM
baseline, highlighting the potential of conformalized generative models for
more trustworthy probabilistic downscaling to high-resolution meteorological
fields.

Conclusion: ISER有效解决了现有异常检测方法的关键限制，通过集成表示和相似性评分显著提升了检测性能，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a critical task in data mining and management with
applications spanning fraud detection, network security, and log monitoring.
Despite extensive research, existing unsupervised anomaly detection methods
still face fundamental challenges including conflicting distributional
assumptions, computational inefficiency, and difficulty handling different
anomaly types. To address these problems, we propose ISER (Isolation-based
Spherical Ensemble Representations) that extends existing isolation-based
methods by using hypersphere radii as proxies for local density characteristics
while maintaining linear time and constant space complexity. ISER constructs
ensemble representations where hypersphere radii encode density information:
smaller radii indicate dense regions while larger radii correspond to sparse
areas. We introduce a novel similarity-based scoring method that measures
pattern consistency by comparing ensemble representations against a theoretical
anomaly reference pattern. Additionally, we enhance the performance of
Isolation Forest by using ISER and adapting the scoring function to address
axis-parallel bias and local anomaly detection limitations. Comprehensive
experiments on 22 real-world datasets demonstrate ISER's superior performance
over 11 baseline methods.

Motivation: 随着机器学习在信息物理系统中的普及，需要将训练从云端转移到设备端（TinyML），但由于超低功耗微控制器的计算资源有限，训练变得具有挑战性。

Method: 设计分布式学习方法，结合机器学习和无线通信，利用所有设备进行分布式训练，使用专门的、计算高效的分类器，并通过定制的高效无线多跳通信协议克服通信瓶颈。

Result: 在20个超低功耗设备的测试平台上，RockNet成功从零开始学习时间序列分类任务，精度比最新的神经网络微控制器训练方法提高多达2倍。分布式架构在从1个设备扩展到20个设备时，每个设备的内存、延迟和能耗降低高达90%。

Conclusion: 分布式机器学习、分布式计算和通信的紧密集成首次使得在超低功耗硬件上实现最先进精度的训练成为可能。

Abstract: As Machine Learning (ML) becomes integral to Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS),
there is growing interest in shifting training from traditional cloud-based to
on-device processing (TinyML), for example, due to privacy and latency
concerns. However, CPS often comprise ultra-low-power microcontrollers, whose
limited compute resources make training challenging. This paper presents
RockNet, a new TinyML method tailored for ultra-low-power hardware that
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in timeseries classification, such as fault
or malware detection, without requiring offline pretraining. By leveraging that
CPS consist of multiple devices, we design a distributed learning method that
integrates ML and wireless communication. RockNet leverages all devices for
distributed training of specialized compute efficient classifiers that need
minimal communication overhead for parallelization. Combined with tailored and
efficient wireless multi-hop communication protocols, our approach overcomes
the communication bottleneck that often occurs in distributed learning.
Hardware experiments on a testbed with 20 ultra-low-power devices demonstrate
RockNet's effectiveness. It successfully learns timeseries classification tasks
from scratch, surpassing the accuracy of the latest approach for neural network
microcontroller training by up to 2x. RockNet's distributed ML architecture
reduces memory, latency and energy consumption per device by up to 90 % when
scaling from one central device to 20 devices. Our results show that a tight
integration of distributed ML, distributed computing, and communication
enables, for the first time, training on ultra-low-power hardware with
state-of-the-art accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究在战略性分类中引入弃权机制的影响，证明最优弃权策略能确保决策者的效用不低于无弃权情况，并能抑制代理人的策略性操纵行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 算法决策日益普及但易受策略性操纵，先前研究表明分类器弃权能提高准确性。本文探索在战略性分类背景下引入弃权如何影响策略代理人的反应以及决策者应如何最优利用弃权。

Method: 使用Stackelberg博弈模型，决策者（分类器）首先宣布决策策略，然后策略代理人操纵特征以获得期望结果。专注于二元分类器，代理人操纵可观察特征而非真实特征。

Result: 最优弃权确保决策者效用在策略代理人存在时不劣于无弃权设置。弃权不仅能提高准确性，还能作为操纵威慑，使资格较差的代理人操纵成本更高。

Conclusion: 弃权是减少算法决策系统中策略行为负面影响的宝贵工具，特别是在操纵成本足够影响代理人行为时效果显著。

Abstract: Algorithmic decision making is increasingly prevalent, but often vulnerable
to strategic manipulation by agents seeking a favorable outcome. Prior research
has shown that classifier abstention (allowing a classifier to decline making a
decision due to insufficient confidence) can significantly increase classifier
accuracy. This paper studies abstention within a strategic classification
context, exploring how its introduction impacts strategic agents' responses and
how principals should optimally leverage it. We model this interaction as a
Stackelberg game where a principal, acting as the classifier, first announces
its decision policy, and then strategic agents, acting as followers, manipulate
their features to receive a desired outcome. Here, we focus on binary
classifiers where agents manipulate observable features rather than their true
features, and show that optimal abstention ensures that the principal's utility
(or loss) is no worse than in a non-abstention setting, even in the presence of
strategic agents. We also show that beyond improving accuracy, abstention can
also serve as a deterrent to manipulation, making it costlier for agents,
especially those less qualified, to manipulate to achieve a positive outcome
when manipulation costs are significant enough to affect agent behavior. These
results highlight abstention as a valuable tool for reducing the negative
effects of strategic behavior in algorithmic decision making systems.

Result: 在FAQ响应优化、热稳定蛋白质搜索和量子电路设计三个任务中验证，在线微调显著提高了样本效率，对计算效率影响可忽略。

Conclusion: ToSFiT方法通过仔细适应最大后验概率的原则，在理论上获得了与标准Thompson采样相当的强保证，在实践中表现出优异的性能。

Abstract: Bayesian optimization in large unstructured discrete spaces is often hindered
by the computational cost of maximizing acquisition functions due to the
absence of gradients. We propose a scalable alternative based on Thompson
sampling that eliminates the need for acquisition function maximization by
directly parameterizing the probability that a candidate yields the maximum
reward. Our approach, Thompson Sampling via Fine-Tuning (ToSFiT) leverages the
prior knowledge embedded in prompt-conditioned large language models, and
incrementally adapts them toward the posterior. Theoretically, we derive a
novel regret bound for a variational formulation of Thompson Sampling that
matches the strong guarantees of its standard counterpart. Our analysis reveals
the critical role of careful adaptation to the posterior probability of
maximality--a principle that underpins our ToSFiT algorithm. Empirically, we
validate our method on three diverse tasks: FAQ response refinement, thermally
stable protein search, and quantum circuit design. We demonstrate that online
fine-tuning significantly improves sample efficiency, with negligible impact on
computational efficiency.

Conclusion: 邻近核方法能够有效处理不完整数据的相似性计算问题，在保持计算效率的同时提供更准确的相似性度量。

Abstract: Measuring similarity between incomplete data is a fundamental challenge in
web mining, recommendation systems, and user behavior analysis. Traditional
approaches either discard incomplete data or perform imputation as a
preprocessing step, leading to information loss and biased similarity
estimates. This paper presents the proximity kernel, a new similarity measure
that directly computes similarity between incomplete data in kernel feature
space without explicit imputation in the original space. The proposed method
introduces data-dependent binning combined with proximity assignment to project
data into a high-dimensional sparse representation that adapts to local density
variations. For missing value handling, we propose a cascading fallback
strategy to estimate missing feature distributions. We conduct clustering tasks
on the proposed kernel representation across 12 real world incomplete datasets,
demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods while
maintaining linear time complexity. All the code are available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Generalist框架，通过多专家网络分工协作解决对抗训练中的自然精度下降和跨攻击鲁棒性差的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗训练存在两个主要局限：自然精度显著下降，以及在不同范数约束攻击间的鲁棒性迁移能力差

Method: 将泛化目标分解为多个子任务，每个基础学习器专注于特定目标，后期通过参数插值形成全局学习器，并周期性重新分配参数防止优化轨迹偏离

Result: 理论分析和实验表明，Generalist实现了更低的泛化误差，显著缓解了权衡问题

Conclusion: Generalist为开发完全鲁棒的分类器提供了有前景的方向

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of neural networks, they remain highly vulnerable
to adversarial examples, for which adversarial training (AT) is currently the
most effective defense. While AT has been extensively studied, its practical
applications expose two major limitations: natural accuracy tends to degrade
significantly compared with standard training, and robustness does not transfer
well across attacks crafted under different norm constraints. Unlike prior
works that attempt to address only one issue within a single network, we
propose to partition the overall generalization goal into multiple sub-tasks,
each assigned to a dedicated base learner. By specializing in its designated
objective, each base learner quickly becomes an expert in its field. In the
later stages of training, we interpolate their parameters to form a
knowledgeable global learner, while periodically redistributing the global
parameters back to the base learners to prevent their optimization trajectories
from drifting too far from the shared target. We term this framework Generalist
and introduce three variants tailored to different application scenarios. Both
theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that Generalist
achieves lower generalization error and significantly alleviates the trade-off
problems compared with baseline methods. Our results suggest that Generalist
provides a promising step toward developing fully robust classifiers in the
future.

Conclusion: 验证了依赖建模与对比学习结合的有效性，为云服务异常检测提供了完整技术方案，在复杂环境中表现出强大的适应性和稳定性。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of complex dependencies and diverse
anomaly patterns in cloud service environments by proposing a dependency
modeling and anomaly detection method that integrates contrastive learning. The
method abstracts service interactions into a dependency graph, extracts
temporal and structural features through embedding functions, and employs a
graph convolution mechanism to aggregate neighborhood information for
context-aware service representations. A contrastive learning framework is then
introduced, constructing positive and negative sample pairs to enhance the
separability of normal and abnormal patterns in the representation space.
Furthermore, a temporal consistency constraint is designed to maintain
representation stability across time steps and reduce the impact of short-term
fluctuations and noise. The overall optimization combines contrastive loss and
temporal consistency loss to ensure stable and reliable detection across
multi-dimensional features. Experiments on public datasets systematically
evaluate the method from hyperparameter, environmental, and data sensitivity
perspectives. Results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms
existing methods on key metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC,
while maintaining robustness under conditions of sparse labeling, monitoring
noise, and traffic fluctuations. This study verifies the effectiveness of
integrating dependency modeling with contrastive learning, provides a complete
technical solution for cloud service anomaly detection, and demonstrates strong
adaptability and stability in complex environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据可用性和预测准确性需求的增长，利益相关者之间的协作受到数据所有权和竞争利益的限制，需要新的协作框架。

Conclusion: 该预测市场设计能够有效促进利益相关者之间的协作，同时满足多种期望的经济特性。

Abstract: Although both data availability and the demand for accurate forecasts are
increasing, collaboration between stakeholders is often constrained by data
ownership and competitive interests. In contrast to recent proposals within
cooperative game-theoretical frameworks, we place ourselves in a more general
framework, based on prediction markets. There, independent agents trade
forecasts of uncertain future events in exchange for rewards. We introduce and
analyse a prediction market that (i) accounts for the historical performance of
the agents, (ii) adapts to time-varying conditions, while (iii) permitting
agents to enter and exit the market at will. The proposed design employs robust
regression models to learn the optimal forecasts' combination whilst handling
missing submissions. Moreover, we introduce a pay-off allocation mechanism that
considers both in-sample and out-of-sample performance while satisfying several
desirable economic properties. Case-studies using simulated and real-world data
allow demonstrating the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed market
design.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一个假设宽松的框架来评估生存分析中条件平均处理效应估计在面临删失偏差时的稳健性，通过部分识别方法推导CATE的边界，并开发新的元学习器来估计这些边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床试验中高达一半的患者因副作用或其他原因提前退出研究，当退出是信息性时（即依赖于生存时间），会引入删失偏差，导致治疗效果估计也存在偏差。

Method: 使用部分识别方法推导条件平均处理效应的信息边界，开发新的元学习器利用任意机器学习模型估计这些边界，具有双重稳健性和准oracle效率的理论特性。

Result: 通过数值实验和癌症药物试验应用证明了元学习器的实际价值，能够识别即使在信息性删失情况下治疗仍然有效的患者亚组。

Conclusion: 该框架为评估存在删失时估计治疗效果的稳健性提供了实用工具，促进了生存数据在医学和流行病学中证据生成的可靠使用。

Abstract: Dropout is common in clinical studies, with up to half of patients leaving
early due to side effects or other reasons. When dropout is informative (i.e.,
dependent on survival time), it introduces censoring bias, because of which
treatment effect estimates are also biased. In this paper, we propose an
assumption-lean framework to assess the robustness of conditional average
treatment effect (CATE) estimates in survival analysis when facing censoring
bias. Unlike existing works that rely on strong assumptions, such as
non-informative censoring, to obtain point estimation, we use partial
identification to derive informative bounds on the CATE. Thereby, our framework
helps to identify patient subgroups where treatment is effective despite
informative censoring. We further develop a novel meta-learner that estimates
the bounds using arbitrary machine learning models and with favorable
theoretical properties, including double robustness and quasi-oracle
efficiency. We demonstrate the practical value of our meta-learner through
numerical experiments and in an application to a cancer drug trial. Together,
our framework offers a practical tool for assessing the robustness of estimated
treatment effects in the presence of censoring and thus promotes the reliable
use of survival data for evidence generation in medicine and epidemiology.

Abstract: Enhancing scene understanding in adverse visibility conditions remains a
critical challenge for surveillance and autonomous navigation systems.
Conventional imaging modalities, such as RGB and thermal infrared (MWIR /
LWIR), when fused, often struggle to deliver comprehensive scene information,
particularly under conditions of atmospheric interference or inadequate
illumination. To address these limitations, Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) imaging
has emerged as a promising modality due to its ability to penetrate atmospheric
disturbances and differentiate materials with improved clarity. However, the
advancement and widespread implementation of SWIR-based systems face
significant hurdles, primarily due to the scarcity of publicly accessible SWIR
datasets. In response to this challenge, our research introduces an approach to
synthetically generate SWIR-like structural/contrast cues (without claiming
spectral reproduction) images from existing LWIR data using advanced contrast
enhancement techniques. We then propose a multimodal fusion framework
integrating synthetic SWIR, LWIR, and RGB modalities, employing an optimized
encoder-decoder neural network architecture with modality-specific encoders and
a softmax-gated fusion head. Comprehensive experiments on public {RGB-LWIR
benchmarks (M3FD, TNO, CAMEL, MSRS, RoadScene) and an additional private real
RGB-MWIR-SWIR dataset} demonstrate that our synthetic-SWIR-enhanced fusion
framework improves fused-image quality (contrast, edge definition, structural
fidelity) while maintaining real-time performance. We also add fair trimodal
baselines (LP, LatLRR, GFF) and cascaded trimodal variants of
U2Fusion/SwinFusion under a unified protocol. The outcomes highlight
substantial potential for real-world applications in surveillance and
autonomous systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdaLog是一个轻量级自适应系统，通过消除特征级冗余数据和优化异构行为存储，显著减少移动应用中用户行为日志的存储空间（19%-44%），同时保持模型推理精度和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习在移动应用中的普及，记录用户行为数据带来了巨大的存储成本，导致系统响应性下降和应用卸载率上升。现有工业实践存在两个关键低效问题：跨特征和模型的重叠行为数据冗余记录，以及异构属性描述导致的稀疏存储。

Method: 1. 将特征级冗余数据消除建模为超图中的最大权重匹配问题，提出分层算法用于设备端部署；2. 采用虚拟哈希属性设计将异构行为分布到少量物理密集的日志文件中；3. 设计增量更新机制以适应动态用户行为模式，最小化I/O操作。

Result: 在真实用户数据上的评估显示，AdaLog将行为日志大小减少了19%至44%，系统开销极小（仅2秒延迟和15MB内存使用），为设备端机器学习提供了更高效的数据基础。

Conclusion: AdaLog成功解决了移动应用中用户行为日志的存储瓶颈问题，通过消除冗余和优化存储结构，在保证模型性能的同时显著提升了存储效率，促进了设备端机器学习的更广泛应用。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models are increasingly integrated into modern mobile
apps to enable personalized and intelligent services. These models typically
rely on rich input features derived from historical user behaviors to capture
user intents. However, as ML-driven services become more prevalent, recording
necessary user behavior data imposes substantial storage cost on mobile apps,
leading to lower system responsiveness and more app uninstalls. To address this
storage bottleneck, we present AdaLog, a lightweight and adaptive system
designed to improve the storage efficiency of user behavior log in ML-embedded
mobile apps, without compromising model inference accuracy or latency. We
identify two key inefficiencies in current industrial practices of user
behavior log: (i) redundant logging of overlapping behavior data across
different features and models, and (ii) sparse storage caused by storing
behaviors with heterogeneous attribute descriptions in a single log file. To
solve these issues, AdaLog first formulates the elimination of feature-level
redundant data as a maximum weighted matching problem in hypergraphs, and
proposes a hierarchical algorithm for efficient on-device deployment. Then,
AdaLog employs a virtually hashed attribute design to distribute heterogeneous
behaviors into a few log files with physically dense storage. Finally, to
ensure scalability to dynamic user behavior patterns, AdaLog designs an
incremental update mechanism to minimize the I/O operations needed for adapting
outdated behavior log. We implement a prototype of AdaLog and deploy it into
popular mobile apps in collaboration with our industry partner. Evaluations on
real-world user data show that AdaLog reduces behavior log size by 19% to 44%
with minimal system overhead (only 2 seconds latency and 15 MB memory usage),
providing a more efficient data foundation for broader adoption of on-device
ML.

Result: 在三个应用中验证了方法的有效性：跨重训练的兼容性维护、不同文本检索模型的组合、以及混合模态搜索的改进，在后者中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过正交变换对齐嵌入模型是一种简单有效的方法，能够解决嵌入模型互操作性问题，同时保持嵌入空间的几何特性。

Abstract: Embedding models trained separately on similar data often produce
representations that encode stable information but are not directly
interchangeable. This lack of interoperability raises challenges in several
practical applications, such as model retraining, partial model upgrades, and
multimodal search. Driven by these challenges, we study when two sets of
embeddings can be aligned by an orthogonal transformation. We show that if
pairwise dot products are approximately preserved, then there exists an
isometry that closely aligns the two sets, and we provide a tight bound on the
alignment error. This insight yields a simple alignment recipe, Procrustes
post-processing, that makes two embedding models interoperable while preserving
the geometry of each embedding space. Empirically, we demonstrate its
effectiveness in three applications: maintaining compatibility across
retrainings, combining different models for text retrieval, and improving
mixed-modality search, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 在肿瘤学中，实验数据通常稀疏且仅包含少数时间点的肿瘤体积数据，需要一种能够从有限数据中学习复杂动力学的方法。

Method: 扩展物理信息神经网络(PINN)，将观察到的生物约束作为正则化项嵌入，通过嵌入从动力学系统先验信息导出的归纳偏置来改进算法。

Result: 改进的PINN算法能够在仅有少量训练样本的情况下收敛到合理解并具有良好的泛化能力，成功学习了间歇性组合疗法的动力学，并获得了ODE解和部分模型参数的时变形式。

Conclusion: 该方法在MSE、MAE和MAPE等指标上表现出强收敛性，证明了PINN框架在肿瘤学中处理稀疏数据和复杂动力学问题的有效性。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are neural networks that embed the
laws of dynamical systems modeled by differential equations into their loss
function as constraints. In this work, we present a PINN framework applied to
oncology. Here, we seek to learn time-varying interactions due to a combination
therapy in a tumor microenvironment. In oncology, experimental data are often
sparse and composed of a few time points of tumor volume. By embedding
inductive biases derived from prior information about a dynamical system, we
extend the physics-informed neural networks (PINN) and incorporate observed
biological constraints as regularization agents. The modified PINN algorithm is
able to steer itself to a reasonable solution and can generalize well with only
a few training examples. We demonstrate the merit of our approach by learning
the dynamics of treatment applied intermittently in an ordinary differential
equation (ODE) model of a combination therapy. The algorithm yields a solution
to the ODE and time-varying forms of some of the ODE model parameters. We
demonstrate a strong convergence using metrics such as the mean squared error
(MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).

Result: 在6个基准数据集上的评估显示，该方法在4个数据集中获得了最佳模糊方法分数，在2个数据集中优于不透明模型，在1个数据集中获得最佳总体分数，RMSE改进范围从0.4%到19%。

Conclusion: 这种混合方法为预测建模提供了一个平衡且多功能的工具，有效解决了模糊系统中可解释性与准确性之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: Regression analysis is employed to examine and quantify the relationships
between input variables and a dependent and continuous output variable. It is
widely used for predictive modelling in fields such as finance, healthcare, and
engineering. However, traditional methods often struggle with real-world data
complexities, including uncertainty and ambiguity. While deep learning
approaches excel at capturing complex non-linear relationships, they lack
interpretability and risk over-fitting on small datasets. Fuzzy systems provide
an alternative framework for handling uncertainty and imprecision, with Mamdani
and Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) systems offering complementary strengths:
interpretability versus accuracy. This paper presents a novel fuzzy regression
method that combines the interpretability of Mamdani systems with the precision
of TSK models. The proposed approach introduces a hybrid rule structure with
fuzzy and crisp components and dual dominance types, enhancing both accuracy
and explainability. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance in several cases, with rules maintaining a
component similar to traditional Mamdani systems while improving precision
through improved rule outputs. This hybrid methodology offers a balanced and
versatile tool for predictive modelling, addressing the trade-off between
interpretability and accuracy inherent in fuzzy systems. In the 6 datasets
tested, the proposed approach gave the best fuzzy methodology score in 4
datasets, out-performed the opaque models in 2 datasets and produced the best
overall score in 1 dataset with the improvements in RMSE ranging from 0.4% to
19%.

Motivation: 高层建筑会导致停车场GPS点从实际位置漂移，且低成本GPS设备本身存在定位误差，需要一种无监督方法来校正大量停车场GPS点中的错误。

Conclusion: 该方法为停车场管理、政策和城市发展应用提供了准确的GPS定位数据，数据集和代码已公开。

Abstract: Parking spots are essential components, providing vital mobile resources for
residents in a city. Accurate Global Positioning System (GPS) points of parking
spots are the core data for subsequent applications,e.g., parking management,
parking policy, and urban development. However, high-rise buildings tend to
cause GPS points to drift from the actual locations of parking spots; besides,
the standard lower-cost GPS equipment itself has a certain location error.
Therefore, it is a non-trivial task to correct a few wrong GPS points from a
large number of parking spots in an unsupervised approach. In this paper,
motivated by the physical constraints of parking spots (i.e., parking spots are
parallel to the sides of roads), we propose an unsupervised low-rank method to
effectively rectify errors in GPS points and further align them to the parking
spots in a unified framework. The proposed unconventional rectification and
alignment method is simple and yet effective for any type of GPS point errors.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method to
solve a practical problem. The data set and the code are publicly accessible

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证多项式非负性是一个NP难问题，而SOS性质是充分条件。但传统方法需要求解维度随单项式基大小平方增长的SDP，计算代价高昂。

Method: 训练Transformer模型预测几乎最小的单项式基，包含三个关键组件：生成超过1亿个SOS多项式的训练数据集、设计和训练Transformer架构、确保正确终止的系统回退机制。

Result: 在200多个基准数据集上验证，相比最先进求解器实现100倍以上加速，并能解决竞争方法失败的实例。

Conclusion: 该方法为提升SOS编程的实际可扩展性提供了新思路，通过机器学习大幅优化传统优化问题的求解效率。

Abstract: Certifying nonnegativity of polynomials is a well-known NP-hard problem with
direct applications spanning non-convex optimization, control, robotics, and
beyond. A sufficient condition for nonnegativity is the Sum of Squares (SOS)
property, i.e., it can be written as a sum of squares of other polynomials. In
practice, however, certifying the SOS criterion remains computationally
expensive and often involves solving a Semidefinite Program (SDP), whose
dimensionality grows quadratically in the size of the monomial basis of the SOS
expression; hence, various methods to reduce the size of the monomial basis
have been proposed. In this work, we introduce the first learning-augmented
algorithm to certify the SOS criterion. To this end, we train a Transformer
model that predicts an almost-minimal monomial basis for a given polynomial,
thereby drastically reducing the size of the corresponding SDP. Our overall
methodology comprises three key components: efficient training dataset
generation of over 100 million SOS polynomials, design and training of the
corresponding Transformer architecture, and a systematic fallback mechanism to
ensure correct termination, which we analyze theoretically. We validate our
approach on over 200 benchmark datasets, achieving speedups of over $100\times$
compared to state-of-the-art solvers and enabling the solution of instances
where competing approaches fail. Our findings provide novel insights towards
transforming the practical scalability of SOS programming.

Conclusion: L2正则化经验风险最小化本身就能提供良好校准的模型，无需提升或后处理重新校准，为模型校准提供了新的理论视角。

Abstract: Calibration of predicted probabilities is critical for reliable machine
learning, yet it is poorly understood how standard training procedures yield
well-calibrated models. This work provides the first theoretical proof that
canonical $L_{2}$-regularized empirical risk minimization directly controls the
smooth calibration error (smCE) without post-hoc correction or specialized
calibration-promoting regularizer. We establish finite-sample generalization
bounds for smCE based on optimization error, regularization strength, and the
Rademacher complexity. We then instantiate this theory for models in
reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, deriving concrete guarantees for kernel
ridge and logistic regression. Our experiments confirm these specific
guarantees, demonstrating that $L_{2}$-regularized ERM can provide a
well-calibrated model without boosting or post-hoc recalibration. The source
code to reproduce all experiments is available at

*Victor Boone,Adrienne Tuynman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了马尔可夫决策过程中偏差最优性层次结构的策略识别问题，构建了具有渐近消失错误概率的学习算法，并确定了可以在有限时间内停止识别的MDP类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 平均收益最优性在MDP中过于渐近，需要结合即时损失度量来考虑偏差最优性层次结构，直至Blackwell最优性。

Method: 为每个最优性阶次构建学习算法，并开发可触发有限时间停止的停止规则。

Result: 确定了具有唯一Bellman最优策略的MDP类别可以在有限时间内停止识别，且该类别与最优性阶次无关。

Conclusion: 提出的学习算法结合停止规则可以在可能的情况下实现有限时间识别，为偏差最优性策略识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Although average gain optimality is a commonly adopted performance measure in
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), it is often too asymptotic. Further
incorporating measures of immediate losses leads to the hierarchy of bias
optimalities, all the way up to Blackwell optimality. In this paper, we
investigate the problem of identifying policies of such optimality orders. To
that end, for each order, we construct a learning algorithm with vanishing
probability of error. Furthermore, we characterize the class of MDPs for which
identification algorithms can stop in finite time. That class corresponds to
the MDPs with a unique Bellman optimal policy, and does not depend on the
optimality order considered. Lastly, we provide a tractable stopping rule that
when coupled to our learning algorithm triggers in finite time whenever it is
possible to do so.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于CLIP框架的多模态癫痫检测模型DistilCLIP-EEG，整合EEG信号和文本描述，通过知识蒸馏训练轻量级学生模型，在多个数据集上准确率超过97%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法仅依赖单模态EEG信号，忽略了多模态信息的潜在优势，需要开发能整合EEG和文本描述的综合癫痫检测方法。

Method: 使用Conformer架构的EEG编码器和可学习BERT作为文本编码器，在共享潜在空间进行跨模态表示学习，并通过知识蒸馏训练更紧凑的学生模型。

Result: 在TUSZ、AUBMC和CHB-MIT数据集上，师生模型准确率均超过97%，F1分数始终高于0.94，学生模型参数量减少约58.1%。

Conclusion: 该模型为EEG癫痫检测提供了有效解决方案，并为资源受限环境部署轻量级模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Epilepsy is a prevalent neurological disorder marked by sudden, brief
episodes of excessive neuronal activity caused by abnormal electrical
discharges, which may lead to some mental disorders. Most existing deep
learning methods for epilepsy detection rely solely on unimodal EEG signals,
neglecting the potential benefits of multimodal information. To address this,
we propose a novel multimodal model, DistilCLIP-EEG, based on the CLIP
framework, which integrates both EEG signals and text descriptions to capture
comprehensive features of epileptic seizures. The model involves an EEG encoder
based on the Conformer architecture as a text encoder, the proposed Learnable
BERT (BERT-LP) as prompt learning within the encoders. Both operate in a shared
latent space for effective cross-modal representation learning. To enhance
efficiency and adaptability, we introduce a knowledge distillation method where
the trained DistilCLIP-EEG serves as a teacher to guide a more compact student
model to reduce training complexity and time. On the TUSZ, AUBMC, and CHB-MIT
datasets, both the teacher and student models achieved accuracy rates exceeding
97%. Across all datasets, the F1-scores were consistently above 0.94,
demonstrating the robustness and reliability of the proposed framework.
Moreover, the student model's parameter count and model size are approximately
58.1% of those of the teacher model, significantly reducing model complexity
and storage requirements while maintaining high performance. These results
highlight the potential of our proposed model for EEG-based epilepsy detection
and establish a solid foundation for deploying lightweight models in
resource-constrained settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在保护人类偏好标签隐私的前提下，如何有效进行KL正则化的人类反馈强化学习，解决隐私保护与学习效率之间的平衡问题。

Method: 在离线设置中使用基于悲观主义的算法，在在线设置中使用基于乐观主义的算法，并在本地差分隐私模型下分析KL正则化RLHF问题。

Result: 离线设置中获得了$\tilde{O}(1/[(e^\epsilon-1)^2 n])$的次优性差距，并证明了其最优性；在线设置中获得了$O(d_{\mathcal{F}}\log(N_{\mathcal{F}}\cdot T)/(e^\epsilon-1)^2)$的对数遗憾界。

Conclusion: 本文为隐私保护下的RLHF提供了理论分析框架，首次在在线设置中研究了KL正则化RLHF的隐私保护问题，并开源了算法实现。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the offline and online settings of reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) with KL-regularization -- a widely used
objective function in large language model alignment -- under the $\epsilon$
local differential privacy ($\epsilon$-LDP) model on the label of the human
preference. In the offline setting, we design an algorithm based on the
principle of pessimism and derive a new suboptimality gap of
$\tilde{O}(1/[(e^\epsilon-1)^2 n])$ on the KL-regularized objective under
single-policy concentrability. We also prove its optimality by providing a
matching lower bound where $n$ is the sample size.
  In the online setting, we are the first one to theoretically investigate the
problem of KL-regularized RLHF with LDP. We design an optimism-based algorithm
and derive a logarithmic regret bound of $O(d_{\mathcal{F}}\log
(N_{\mathcal{F}}\cdot T) /(e^\epsilon-1)^2 )$, where $T$ is the total time
step, $N_{\mathcal{F}}$ is cardinality of the reward function space
$\mathcal{F}$ and $d_{\mathcal{F}}$ is a variant of eluder dimension for RLHF.
As a by-product of our analysis, our results also imply the first analysis for
online KL-regularized RLHF without privacy. We implement our algorithm in the
offline setting to verify our theoretical results and release our open source
code at: https://github.com/rushil-thareja/PPKL-RLHF-Official.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种在设备上在线持续合并LoRA适配器的数据无关且计算高效的方法，以解决移动设备存储限制下的多任务支持问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动设备部署LLM时使用LoRA适配器支持多样化下游任务，但存储容量有限。现有模型合并技术无法有效处理LoRA增量交付的场景，需要在线持续合并新LoRA同时保持先前任务性能。

Method: 提出数据无关且计算高效的策略，在新LoRA可用时选择和合并适配器，设备仅存储有限数量的适配器。

Result: 在真实世界任务上的广泛实验表明，该方法在遵守设备存储预算和计算限制的同时，相比替代策略具有优越性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了设备上在线持续合并LoRA的挑战，为资源受限环境下的多任务LLM部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: On-device deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently leverages
Low-Rank Adapters (LoRAs) to support diverse downstream tasks under tight
resource constraints. To address the limited storage capacity of mobile
devices, recent works have explored model merging techniques to fuse multiple
LoRAs into a single one. In practice, however, LoRAs are often delivered
incrementally, as users request support for new tasks (e.g., novel problem
types or languages). This scenario introduces a new challenge: on-device online
continual merging, where the objective is to incorporate new LoRAs while
preserving the performance on previously supported tasks. In this paper, we
propose a data-free and computationally efficient strategy for selecting and
merging LoRAs when a new one becomes available, assuming the device can store
only a limited number of adapters. Extensive experiments across real-world
tasks demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to alternative
strategies while adhering to the storage budget and compute limitations of
on-device settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProtoTopic是一种基于原型网络的主题模型，专门用于医学论文摘要的主题生成，在数据有限的情况下表现优于传统主题建模方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主题建模技术在医学文本上表现不佳，特别是当某些医疗主题的文档数量较少时。

Method: 使用原型网络构建主题模型，通过计算输入数据点与原型表示之间的距离来进行预测，特别适合低数据量或少样本学习场景。

Result: 与文献中的两个主题建模基线相比，ProtoTopic在主题一致性和多样性方面都有显著提升。

Conclusion: ProtoTopic能够在数据有限的情况下生成医学相关主题，证明了原型网络在医学主题建模中的有效性。

Abstract: Topic modeling is a useful tool for analyzing large corpora of written
documents, particularly academic papers. Despite a wide variety of proposed
topic modeling techniques, these techniques do not perform well when applied to
medical texts. This can be due to the low number of documents available for
some topics in the healthcare domain. In this paper, we propose ProtoTopic, a
prototypical network-based topic model used for topic generation for a set of
medical paper abstracts. Prototypical networks are efficient, explainable
models that make predictions by computing distances between input datapoints
and a set of prototype representations, making them particularly effective in
low-data or few-shot learning scenarios. With ProtoTopic, we demonstrate
improved topic coherence and diversity compared to two topic modeling baselines
used in the literature, demonstrating the ability of our model to generate
medically relevant topics even with limited data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展传统在线凸优化(OCO)到多目标场景，考虑K个不同的损失函数序列，需要设计能够同时跟踪所有序列的算法，以最小化最坏情况下的遗憾。

Method: 提出结合Hedge算法和在线梯度下降(OGD)的简单算法，在i.i.d.输入设置下处理多目标在线凸优化问题。

Result: 通过简洁的证明，展示了该算法的期望最小最大遗憾为O(√(T log K))。

Conclusion: 该算法在多目标在线凸优化中实现了接近最优的遗憾界，为处理多目标跟踪问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In online convex optimization (OCO), a single loss function sequence is
revealed over a time horizon of $T$, and an online algorithm has to choose its
action at time $t$, before the loss function at time $t$ is revealed. The goal
of the online algorithm is to incur minimal penalty (called $\textit{regret}$
compared to a static optimal action made by an optimal offline algorithm
knowing all functions of the sequence in advance.
  In this paper, we broaden the horizon of OCO, and consider multi-objective
OCO, where there are $K$ distinct loss function sequences, and an algorithm has
to choose its action at time $t$, before the $K$ loss functions at time $t$ are
revealed. To capture the tradeoff between tracking the $K$ different sequences,
we consider the $\textit{min-max}$ regret, where the benchmark (optimal offline
algorithm) takes a static action across all time slots that minimizes the
maximum of the total loss (summed across time slots) incurred by each of the
$K$ sequences. An online algorithm is allowed to change its action across time
slots, and its {\it min-max} regret is defined as the difference between its
$\textit{min-max}$ cost and that of the benchmark. The $\textit{min-max}$
regret is a stringent performance measure and an algorithm with small regret
needs to `track' all loss function sequences closely at all times.
  We consider this $\textit{min-max}$ regret in the i.i.d. input setting where
all loss functions are i.i.d. generated from an unknown distribution. For the
i.i.d. model we propose a simple algorithm that combines the well-known
$\textit{Hedge}$ and online gradient descent (OGD) and show via a remarkably
simple proof that its expected $\textit{min-max}$ regret is $O(\sqrt{T \log
K})$.

TL;DR: 提出DOLFIN方法，结合Vision Transformers和低秩适配器，在联邦持续学习中实现高效稳定的新任务学习，同时防止遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前联邦持续学习方法在性能、隐私保护和通信效率之间难以平衡，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 使用低秩适配器(LoRA)减少通信开销，结合DualGradient Projection Memory(DualGPM)防止遗忘，在联邦环境中进行分布式在线学习。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、ImageNet-R、ImageNet-A和CUB-200数据集上，DOLFIN在最终平均准确率上持续超越六个强基线方法，同时保持相同的内存占用。

Conclusion: 正交低秩适配器为联邦环境中的隐私保护持续学习提供了有效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) enables models to learn new tasks across
multiple distributed clients, protecting privacy and without forgetting
previously acquired knowledge. However, current methods face challenges
balancing performance, privacy preservation, and communication efficiency. We
introduce a Distributed Online LoRA for Federated INcremental learning method
DOLFIN, a novel approach combining Vision Transformers with low-rank adapters
designed to efficiently and stably learn new tasks in federated environments.
Our method leverages LoRA for minimal communication overhead and incorporates
DualGradient Projection Memory (DualGPM) to prevent forgetting. Evaluated on
CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R, ImageNet-A, and CUB-200 under two Dirichlet
heterogeneity settings, DOLFIN consistently surpasses six strong baselines in
final average accuracy while matching their memory footprint. Orthogonal
low-rank adapters offer an effective and scalable solution for
privacy-preserving continual learning in federated settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了EB-1WL边缘着色细化测试和EB-GNN架构，该架构在消息传递中显式使用三角形，比1-WL更具表达能力，且在实际图学习任务中仅需近线性时间和内存。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN架构表达能力有限且计算效率不高，需要开发既具强表达能力又保持计算效率的新型架构。

Method: 基于Chiba和Nishizeki的经典三角形计数算法，在消息传递过程中显式利用三角形结构信息。

Result: EB-1WL比1-WL表达能力显著更强，EB-GNN在保持计算效率的同时性能优于简单MPNN，与任务专用GNN竞争力相当。

Conclusion: EB-GNN是一种高效通用的GNN架构，在表达能力和计算效率之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: We propose EB-1WL, an edge-based color-refinement test, and a corresponding
GNN architecture, EB-GNN. Our architecture is inspired by a classic triangle
counting algorithm by Chiba and Nishizeki, and explicitly uses triangles during
message passing. We achieve the following results: (1)~EB-1WL is significantly
more expressive than 1-WL. Further, we provide a complete logical
characterization of EB-1WL based on first-order logic, and matching
distinguishability results based on homomorphism counting. (2)~In an important
distinction from previous proposals for more expressive GNN architectures,
EB-1WL and EB-GNN require near-linear time and memory on practical graph
learning tasks. (3)~Empirically, we show that EB-GNN is a highly-efficient
general-purpose architecture: It substantially outperforms simple MPNNs, and
remains competitive with task-specialized GNNs while being significantly more
computationally efficient.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了选择性对抗攻击对LLM基准测试的影响，发现即使微小的语义等效扰动也能显著改变模型在MMLU基准上的相对排名，挑战了排行榜驱动评估的公平性和透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM基准测试容易受到语义等效对抗扰动的影响，但现有研究主要关注对所有模型产生同等影响的攻击，缺乏对选择性攻击（即只针对特定模型性能）的研究。

Method: 使用TextAttack框架中的经典攻击方法，开发选择性评估协议，设计自定义约束来增强攻击选择性，并提出基于代理LLM的管道来生成选择性扰动。

Result: 实证研究发现选择性对抗攻击确实存在，并且能够实质性地改变模型在MMLU基准上的相对排名，影响评估的公平性和可重复性。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在LLM评估中需要采用扰动感知的报告和鲁棒性诊断，即使是微小的编辑也可能改变比较判断，这对排行榜驱动的评估方法提出了挑战。

Abstract: Benchmarking outcomes increasingly govern trust, selection, and deployment of
LLMs, yet these evaluations remain vulnerable to semantically equivalent
adversarial perturbations. Prior work on adversarial robustness in NLP has
emphasized text attacks that affect many models equally, leaving open the
question of whether it is possible to selectively degrade or enhance
performance while minimally affecting other models. We formalize this problem
and study selective adversarial attacks on MMLU - a widely used benchmark
designed to measure a language model's broad general knowledge and reasoning
ability across different subjects. Using canonical attacks integrated into
TextAttack framework, we introduce a protocol for selectivity assessment,
develop a custom constraint to increase selectivity of attacks and propose a
surrogate-LLM pipeline that generates selective perturbations. Empirically, we
find that selective adversarial attacks exist and can materially alter relative
rankings, challenging the fairness, reproducibility, and transparency of
leaderboard-driven evaluation. Our results motivate perturbation-aware
reporting and robustness diagnostics for LLM evaluation and demonstrate that
even subtle edits can shift comparative judgments.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了时间序列基础模型（TSFMs）评估中存在的多个挑战，包括基准数据集代表性不足、缺乏时空评估、信息泄露风险以及外部冲击导致的全局模式记忆问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着时间序列基础模型的发展，其零样本预测能力需要可靠的评估方法。然而，现有评估方法存在数据完整性、基准数据集代表性和信息泄露等问题，需要开发更稳健的评估方法学。

Method: 通过调查现有TSFM评估方法，识别出数据分区混淆、基准数据集代表性不足、缺乏时空评估、信息泄露风险等关键问题。

Result: 研究发现现有评估存在广泛的数据分区混淆问题，导致性能估计膨胀和全局知识错误转移到局部时间序列。还发现外部冲击（如经济危机、疫情）导致的全局模式记忆问题。

Conclusion: 呼吁研究社区开发稳健的评估方法学，设计新的原则性方法（如对真正样本外未来数据的评估），以保障TSFM评估的完整性，避免重蹈LLM和经典时间序列基准测试的覆辙。

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) represent a new paradigm for time
series forecasting, offering zero-shot forecasting capabilities without the
need for domain-specific pre-training or fine-tuning. However, as with Large
Language Models (LLMs), evaluating TSFMs is tricky, as with ever more extensive
training sets, it becomes more and more challenging to ensure the integrity of
benchmarking data. Our investigation of existing TSFM evaluation highlights
multiple challenges, ranging from the representativeness of the benchmark
datasets, over the lack of spatiotemporal evaluation, to risks of information
leakage due to overlapping and obscure datasets, and the memorization of global
patterns caused by external shocks like economic crises or pandemics. Our
findings reveal widespread confusion regarding data partitions, risking
inflated performance estimates and incorrect transfer of global knowledge to
local time series. We argue for the development of robust evaluation
methodologies to prevent pitfalls already observed in LLM and classical time
series benchmarking, and call upon the research community to design new,
principled approaches, such as evaluations on truly out-of-sample future data,
to safeguard the integrity of TSFM assessment.

Motivation: 在先进节点中，功耗、性能和面积优化变得极其复杂。机器学习和设计技术协同优化面临训练数据缺乏和设计流程周转时间长的限制，需要生成更多样化的数据来提升模型泛化和设计空间探索能力。

Method: 提出ArtNet人工网表生成器，能够复制关键拓扑特征，生成更接近目标参数的逼真人工数据集，支持更广泛的机器学习模型训练和设计技术协同优化探索。

Result: 在CNN基DRV预测中，ArtNet数据增强使F1分数比仅使用原始数据集提高0.16；在DTCO应用中，ArtNet生成的mini-brains与目标全规模块设计的PPA匹配度高达97.94%。

Conclusion: ArtNet通过生成逼真的人工网表数据，有效解决了机器学习模型训练数据不足和设计技术协同优化探索受限的问题，显著提升了PPA优化效率和设计空间探索能力。

Abstract: In advanced nodes, optimization of power, performance and area (PPA) has
become highly complex and challenging. Machine learning (ML) and
design-technology co-optimization (DTCO) provide promising mitigations, but
face limitations due to a lack of diverse training data as well as long design
flow turnaround times (TAT). We propose ArtNet, a novel artificial netlist
generator designed to tackle these issues. Unlike previous methods, ArtNet
replicates key topological characteristics, enhancing ML model generalization
and supporting broader design space exploration for DTCO. By producing
realistic artificial datasets that moreclosely match given target parameters,
ArtNet enables more efficient PPAoptimization and exploration of flows and
design enablements. In the context of CNN-based DRV prediction, ArtNet's data
augmentationimproves F1 score by 0.16 compared to using only the original
(real) dataset. In the DTCO context, ArtNet-generated mini-brains achieve a PPA
match up to 97.94%, demonstrating close alignment with design metrics of
targeted full-scale block designs.

Result: XNN在三种训练场景中表现与原模型相当，在未见维度上具有更优的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 多维预训练对基础模型至关重要，XNN为解决物理数据中的维度变化问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: The advent of foundation models in AI has significantly advanced
general-purpose learning, enabling remarkable capabilities in zero-shot
inference and in-context learning. However, training such models on physics
data, including solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs), poses a
unique challenge due to varying dimensionalities across different systems.
Traditional approaches either fix a maximum dimension or employ separate
encoders for different dimensionalities, resulting in inefficiencies. To
address this, we propose a dimension-agnostic neural network architecture, the
Axial Neural Network (XNN), inspired by parameter-sharing structures such as
Deep Sets and Graph Neural Networks. XNN generalizes across varying tensor
dimensions while maintaining computational efficiency. We convert existing PDE
foundation models into axial neural networks and evaluate their performance
across three training scenarios: training from scratch, pretraining on multiple
PDEs, and fine-tuning on a single PDE. Our experiments show that XNNs perform
competitively with original models and exhibit superior generalization to
unseen dimensions, highlighting the importance of multidimensional pretraining
for foundation models.

Motivation: SEEG信号分析对脑机接口和神经科学研究至关重要，但由于输入通道数量庞大且相关性各异，传统通道选择方法难以扩展或提供有意义的可解释性。

Method: 引入通道聚合令牌(CATs)来聚合跨通道信息，利用改进的注意力展开技术计算可量化的通道重要性分数。

Result: 在DuIN数据集上的评估显示，将EEGChaT与现有分类模型集成可显著提高解码准确率，最高获得17%的绝对增益，且产生的通道权重与手动选择的通道有显著重叠。

Conclusion: EEGChaT是高维SEEG分析中有效且可泛化的通道选择解决方案，既提升了性能又提供了对神经信号相关性的洞察。

Abstract: Analyzing stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) signals is critical for
brain-computer interface (BCI) applications and neuroscience research, yet
poses significant challenges due to the large number of input channels and
their heterogeneous relevance. Traditional channel selection methods struggle
to scale or provide meaningful interpretability for SEEG data. In this work, we
propose EEGChaT, a novel Transformer-based channel selection module designed to
automatically identify the most task-relevant channels in SEEG recordings.
EEGChaT introduces Channel Aggregation Tokens (CATs) to aggregate information
across channels, and leverages an improved Attention Rollout technique to
compute interpretable, quantitative channel importance scores. We evaluate
EEGChaT on the DuIN dataset, demonstrating that integrating EEGChaT with
existing classification models consistently improves decoding accuracy,
achieving up to 17\% absolute gains. Furthermore, the channel weights produced
by EEGChaT show substantial overlap with manually selected channels, supporting
the interpretability of the approach. Our results suggest that EEGChaT is an
effective and generalizable solution for channel selection in high-dimensional
SEEG analysis, offering both enhanced performance and insights into neural
signal relevance.

Abstract: Recent advances in sensing and imaging technologies have enabled the
collection of high-dimensional spatiotemporal data across complex geometric
domains. However, effective modeling of such data remains challenging due to
irregular spatial structures, rapid temporal dynamics, and the need to jointly
predict multiple interrelated physical variables. This paper presents a
physics-augmented multi-task Gaussian Process (P-M-GP) framework tailored for
spatiotemporal dynamic systems. Specifically, we develop a geometry-aware,
multi-task Gaussian Process (M-GP) model to effectively capture intrinsic
spatiotemporal structure and inter-task dependencies. To further enhance the
model fidelity and robustness, we incorporate governing physical laws through a
physics-based regularization scheme, thereby constraining predictions to be
consistent with governing dynamical principles. We validate the proposed P-M-GP
framework on a 3D cardiac electrodynamics modeling task. Numerical experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly improves prediction accuracy over
existing methods by effectively incorporating domain-specific physical
constraints and geometric prior.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于隐私法规和安全要求，需要从联邦学习模型中消除特定客户端的贡献，但现有方法需要多轮通信，导致模型在移除过程中不可用，影响系统服务。

Method: 采用任务算术和神经正切核技术，实现快速移除客户端对模型的影响，避免多轮通信。

Result: 该方法能够快速有效地移除客户端贡献，满足时效性和有效性要求。

Conclusion: 提出的解决方案解决了联邦学习中客户端贡献移除的时效性问题，为隐私保护下的模型更新提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Nowdays, there are an abundance of portable devices capable of collecting
large amounts of data and with decent computational power. This opened the
possibility to train AI models in a distributed manner, preserving the
participating clients' privacy. However, because of privacy regulations and
safety requirements, elimination upon necessity of a client contribution to the
model has become mandatory. The cleansing process must satisfy specific
efficacy and time requirements. In recent years, research efforts have produced
several knowledge removal methods, but these require multiple communication
rounds between the data holders and the process coordinator. This can cause the
unavailability of an effective model up to the end of the removal process,
which can result in a disservice to the system users. In this paper, we
introduce an innovative solution based on Task Arithmetic and the Neural
Tangent Kernel, to rapidly remove a client's influence from a model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文为经典非线性降维方法构建神经解码器框架，实现双向映射，并探索在流形空间中的扩散生成过程，但发现重建质量和生成效果不如端到端优化的自编码器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典非线性降维方法如t-SNE、Isomap和LLE只能进行单向变换，无法将低维嵌入映射回原始高维空间，这限制了它们在生成应用中的使用。

Method: 提出系统化框架为经典NLDR方法构建神经解码器架构，实现双向映射，并扩展该框架实现基于扩散的生成过程，直接在学习的流形空间中进行。

Result: 在CelebA数据集上的实验表明，解码器能成功重建数据，但质量不如端到端优化的自编码器；流形约束扩散产生低质量样本，表明经典NLDR嵌入的离散稀疏特性不适合生成模型所需的连续插值。

Conclusion: 为主要为可视化和分析设计的NLDR方法添加生成能力存在固有挑战，经典NLDR嵌入的特性与生成模型要求不匹配。

Abstract: Classical nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) techniques like t-SNE,
Isomap, and LLE excel at creating low-dimensional embeddings for data
visualization but fundamentally lack the ability to map these embeddings back
to the original high-dimensional space. This one-way transformation limits
their use in generative applications. This paper addresses this critical gap by
introducing a system- atic framework for constructing neural decoder
architectures for prominent NLDR methods, enabling bidirectional mapping for
the first time. We extend this framework by implementing a diffusion-based
generative process that operates directly within these learned manifold spaces.
Through experiments on the CelebA dataset, we evaluate the reconstruction and
generative performance of our approach against autoencoder and standard
diffusion model baselines. Our findings reveal a fundamental trade- off: while
the decoders successfully reconstruct data, their quality is surpassed by
end-to-end optimized autoencoders. Moreover, manifold-constrained diffusion
yields poor-quality samples, suggesting that the discrete and sparse nature of
classical NLDR embeddings is ill-suited for the continuous inter- polation
required by generative models. This work highlights the inherent challenges in
retrofitting generative capabilities onto NLDR methods designed primarily for
visualization and analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的量子储层计算研究主要针对单变量信号，且忽略了近期硬件的实际约束。本研究旨在开发适用于多元时间序列的硬件友好型量子储层计算方法。

Method: 采用基于门的量子储层计算架构，配对注入和记忆量子比特，使用针对当前设备连接性和深度优化的Trotter化最近邻横向场Ising演化。

Result: 在Lorenz-63和ENSO数据集上分别获得0.0087和0.0036的均方误差，性能与经典储层计算相当，在某些情况下优于学习型RNN。在IBM Heron R2上，MTS-QRC在现实深度下保持准确性，甚至在ENSO上优于无噪声模拟器。

Conclusion: 研究支持基于门的量子储层计算在NISQ硬件上进行多元时间序列预测的实用性，并激励系统研究硬件噪声何时以及如何有益于量子储层计算的读出。

Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) offers a hardware-friendly approach to
temporal learning, yet most studies target univariate signals and overlook
near-term hardware constraints. This work introduces a gate-based QRC for
multivariate time series (MTS-QRC) that pairs injection and memory qubits and
uses a Trotterized nearest-neighbor transverse-field Ising evolution optimized
for current device connectivity and depth. On Lorenz-63 and ENSO, the method
achieves a mean square error (MSE) of 0.0087 and 0.0036, respectively,
performing on par with classical reservoir computing on Lorenz and above
learned RNNs on both, while NVAR and clustered ESN remain stronger on some
settings. On IBM Heron R2, MTS-QRC sustains accuracy with realistic depths and,
interestingly, outperforms a noiseless simulator on ENSO; singular value
analysis indicates that device noise can concentrate variance in feature
directions, acting as an implicit regularizer for linear readout in this
regime. These findings support the practicality of gate-based QRC for MTS
forecasting on NISQ hardware and motivate systematic studies on when and how
hardware noise benefits QRC readouts.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become central to training large language
models (LLMs), yet the field lacks predictive scaling methodologies comparable
to those established for pre-training. Despite rapidly rising compute budgets,
there is no principled understanding of how to evaluate algorithmic
improvements for scaling RL compute. We present the first large-scale
systematic study, amounting to more than 400,000 GPU-hours, that defines a
principled framework for analyzing and predicting RL scaling in LLMs. We fit
sigmoidal compute-performance curves for RL training and ablate a wide range of
common design choices to analyze their effects on asymptotic performance and
compute efficiency. We observe: (1) Not all recipes yield similar asymptotic
performance, (2) Details such as loss aggregation, normalization, curriculum,
and off-policy algorithm primarily modulate compute efficiency without
materially shifting the asymptote, and (3) Stable, scalable recipes follow
predictable scaling trajectories, enabling extrapolation from smaller-scale
runs. Combining these insights, we propose a best-practice recipe, ScaleRL, and
demonstrate its effectiveness by successfully scaling and predicting validation
performance on a single RL run scaled up to 100,000 GPU-hours. Our work
provides both a scientific framework for analyzing scaling in RL and a
practical recipe that brings RL training closer to the predictability long
achieved in pre-training.

Abstract: The class imbalance problem refers to the insufficiency of data in certain
classes, which causes a classifier to be biased toward the majority class.
Distribution calibration is a technique that seeks to estimate a more accurate
class distribution based on an observed or estimated one. To address this
issue, we propose a distribution calibration-based method-Rebalancing with
Calibrated Sub-classes (RCS): An Enhanced Approach for Robust Imbalanced
Classification, which estimates the distribution parameters of the minority
classes using weighted parameters derived from a mixture of Gaussian components
from both the majority and intermediate classes. An encoder-decoder network is
trained to preserve the structure of the imbalanced data and prevent
disentanglement. After training, feature vectors extracted from the encoder are
used to generate synthetic samples through our distribution calibration
strategy. This approach effectively mitigates the overgeneralization problem
that arises when only the distribution of the majority class is used to
approximate the minority class statistics. Instead, our method calibrates the
parameters by leveraging the distribution of data points in neighboring
regions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
superior classification performance compared to several baseline and
state-of-the-art techniques across a diverse range of image, text, and tabular
datasets.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for the Markov Decision Process (MDP) has emerged
in many security-related applications, such as autonomous driving, financial
decisions, and drone/robot algorithms. In order to improve the
robustness/defense of RL systems against adversaries, studying various
adversarial attacks on RL systems is very important. Most previous work
considered deterministic adversarial attack strategies in MDP, which the
recipient (victim) agent can defeat by reversing the deterministic attacks. In
this paper, we propose a provably ``invincible'' or ``uncounterable'' type of
adversarial attack on RL. The attackers apply a rate-distortion
information-theoretic approach to randomly change agents' observations of the
transition kernel (or other properties) so that the agent gains zero or very
limited information about the ground-truth kernel (or other properties) during
the training. We derive an information-theoretic lower bound on the recipient
agent's reward regret and show the impact of rate-distortion attacks on
state-of-the-art model-based and model-free algorithms. We also extend this
notion of an information-theoretic approach to other types of adversarial
attack, such as state observation attacks.

Abstract: Diagonal preconditioners are computationally feasible approximate to
second-order optimizers, which have shown significant promise in accelerating
training of deep learning models. Two predominant approaches are based on Adam
and Gauss-Newton (GN) methods: the former leverages statistics of current
gradients and is the de-factor optimizers for neural networks, and the latter
uses the diagonal elements of the Gauss-Newton matrix and underpins some of the
recent diagonal optimizers such as Sophia.
  In this work, we compare these two diagonal preconditioning methods through
the lens of two key factors: the choice of basis in the preconditioner, and the
impact of gradient noise from mini-batching. To gain insights, we analyze these
optimizers on quadratic objectives and logistic regression under all four
quadrants. We show that regardless of the basis, there exist instances where
Adam outperforms both GN$^{-1}$ and GN$^{-1/2}$ in full-batch settings.
Conversely, in the stochastic regime, Adam behaves similarly to GN$^{-1/2}$ for
linear regression under a Gaussian data assumption. These theoretical results
are supported by empirical studies on both convex and non-convex objectives.

Conclusion: 该工作通过信息理论方法提升了RLHF的鲁棒性，为奖励过优化问题提供了系统解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in
aligning language models with human values, reward hacking-or reward
over-optimization-remains a major challenge. We identify two key obstacles to
its mitigation: (1) reward misgeneralization in reward modeling, where reward
models overfit to spurious, preference-irrelevant features; and (2) the lack of
suitable regularization during RL optimization, as existing token-level
constraints often over-restrict the policy space. To address these issues, we
propose InfoRM, an information-theoretic reward modeling framework based on the
Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, which filters out preference-irrelevant
information to alleviate reward misgeneralization. We further observe that
reward-hacked responses manifest as pronounced outliers in InfoRM's IB latent
space, measured by Mahalanobis distance from the SFT-induced distribution.
Motivated by this, we introduce IBL, a distribution-level regularization that
penalizes such deviations, effectively expanding the optimization landscape
while maintaining alignment. We prove that IBL is theoretically equivalent to
the pessimistic RL objective within the IB latent space. Finally, we present
Mahalanobis Outlier Probability (MOP), a statistical metric for quantifying
reward hacking severity, enabling principled hyperparameter tuning and online
mitigation such as early stopping. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs
and datasets confirm the generality of our findings, the effectiveness of
InfoRM and IBL, and the reliability of MOP as a diagnostic tool-collectively
advancing the state of RLHF.

Abstract: Pruning is a common technique to reduce the compute and storage requirements
of Neural Networks. While conventional approaches typically retrain the model
to recover pruning-induced performance degradation, state-of-the-art Large
Language Model (LLM) pruning methods operate layer-wise, minimizing the
per-layer pruning error on a small calibration dataset to avoid full
retraining, which is considered computationally prohibitive for LLMs. However,
finding the optimal pruning mask is a hard combinatorial problem and solving it
to optimality is intractable. Existing methods hence rely on greedy heuristics
that ignore the weight interactions in the pruning objective. In this work, we
instead consider the convex relaxation of these combinatorial constraints and
solve the resulting problem using the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm. Our method
drastically reduces the per-layer pruning error, outperforms strong baselines
on state-of-the-art GPT architectures, and remains memory-efficient. We provide
theoretical justification by showing that, combined with the convergence
guarantees of the FW algorithm, we obtain an approximate solution to the
original combinatorial problem upon rounding the relaxed solution to
integrality.

Abstract: Kilometer-scale weather data is crucial for real-world applications but
remains computationally intensive to produce using traditional weather
simulations. An emerging solution is to use deep learning models, which offer a
faster alternative for climate downscaling. However, their reliability is still
in question, as they are often evaluated using standard machine learning
metrics rather than insights from atmospheric and weather physics. This paper
benchmarks recent state-of-the-art deep learning models and introduces
physics-inspired diagnostics to evaluate their performance and reliability,
with a particular focus on geographic generalization and physical consistency.
Our experiments show that, despite the seemingly strong performance of models
such as CorrDiff, when trained on a limited set of European geographies (e.g.,
central Europe), they struggle to generalize to other regions such as Iberia,
Morocco in the south, or Scandinavia in the north. They also fail to accurately
capture second-order variables such as divergence and vorticity derived from
predicted velocity fields. These deficiencies appear even in in-distribution
geographies, indicating challenges in producing physically consistent
predictions. We propose a simple initial solution: introducing a power spectral
density loss function that empirically improves geographic generalization by
encouraging the reconstruction of small-scale physical structures. The code for
reproducing the experimental results can be found at

Abstract: The curse of dimensionality renders Reinforcement Learning (RL) impractical
in many real-world settings with exponentially large state and action spaces.
Yet, many environments exhibit exploitable structure that can accelerate
learning. To formalize this idea, we study RL in Block Markov Decision
Processes (BMDPs). BMDPs model problems with large observation spaces, but
where transition dynamics are fully determined by latent states. Recent
advances in clustering methods have enabled the efficient recovery of this
latent structure. However, a regret analysis that exploits these techniques to
determine their impact on learning performance remained open. We are now
addressing this gap by providing a regret analysis that explicitly leverages
clustering, demonstrating that accurate latent state estimation can indeed
effectively speed up learning.
  Concretely, this paper analyzes a two-phase RL algorithm for BMDPs that first
learns the latent structure through random exploration and then switches to an
optimism-guided strategy adapted to the uncovered structure. This algorithm
achieves a regret that is $O(\sqrt{T}+n)$ on a large class of BMDPs susceptible
to clustering. Here, $T$ denotes the number of time steps, $n$ is the
cardinality of the observation space, and the Landau notation $O(\cdot)$ holds
up to constants and polylogarithmic factors. This improves the best prior
bound, $O(\sqrt{T}+n^2)$, especially when $n$ is large. Moreover, we prove that
no algorithm can achieve lower regret uniformly on this same class of BMDPs.
This establishes that, on this class, the algorithm achieves asymptotic
optimality.

Abstract: Highly accurate datasets from numerical or physical experiments are often
expensive and time-consuming to acquire, posing a significant challenge for
applications that require precise evaluations, potentially across multiple
scenarios and in real-time. Even building sufficiently accurate surrogate
models can be extremely challenging with limited high-fidelity data.
Conversely, less expensive, low-fidelity data can be computed more easily and
encompass a broader range of scenarios. By leveraging multi-fidelity
information, prediction capabilities of surrogates can be improved. However, in
practical situations, data may be different in types, come from sources of
different modalities, and not be concurrently available, further complicating
the modeling process. To address these challenges, we introduce a progressive
multi-fidelity surrogate model. This model can sequentially incorporate diverse
data types using tailored encoders. Multi-fidelity regression from the encoded
inputs to the target quantities of interest is then performed using neural
networks. Input information progressively flows from lower to higher fidelity
levels through two sets of connections: concatenations among all the encoded
inputs, and additive connections among the final outputs. This dual connection
system enables the model to exploit correlations among different datasets while
ensuring that each level makes an additive correction to the previous level
without altering it. This approach prevents performance degradation as new
input data are integrated into the model and automatically adapts predictions
based on the available inputs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach
on numerical benchmarks and a real-world case study, showing that it reliably
integrates multi-modal data and provides accurate predictions, maintaining
performance when generalizing across time and parameter variations.

Abstract: Machine learning solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs) have
attracted growing interest. However, most existing approaches, such as neural
network solvers, rely on stochastic training, which is inefficient and
typically requires a great many training epochs. Gaussian process
(GP)/kernel-based solvers, while mathematical principled, suffer from
scalability issues when handling large numbers of collocation points often
needed for challenging or higher-dimensional PDEs.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose TGPS, a tensor-GP-based solver that
models factor functions along each input dimension using one-dimensional GPs
and combines them via tensor decomposition to approximate the full solution.
This design reduces the task to learning a collection of one-dimensional GPs,
substantially lowering computational complexity, and enabling scalability to
massive collocation sets.
  For efficient nonlinear PDE solving, we use a partial freezing strategy and
Newton's method to linerize the nonlinear terms. We then develop an alternating
least squares (ALS) approach that admits closed-form updates, thereby
substantially enhancing the training efficiency. We establish theoretical
guarantees on the expressivity of our model, together with convergence proof
and error analysis under standard regularity assumptions. Experiments on
several benchmark PDEs demonstrate that our method achieves superior accuracy
and efficiency compared to existing approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UrbanFusion是一个地理基础模型，通过随机多模态融合技术整合街景图像、遥感数据、地图和POI数据，在41个任务的全球评估中表现出优越的泛化能力和预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法主要使用任务特定模型，而现有的空间表示基础模型仅支持有限模态且缺乏多模态融合能力。需要开发能够有效整合多种地理空间数据的统一框架。

Method: 采用模态特定编码器处理不同类型输入，通过基于Transformer的融合模块学习统一表示，支持在预训练和推理期间灵活使用任何可用模态子集。

Result: 在56个城市的41个任务评估中，UrbanFusion优于现有GeoAI模型：1)在位置编码上超越先前基础模型；2)支持推理时的多模态输入；3)对训练未见区域具有良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: UrbanFusion通过随机多模态融合技术实现了强大的泛化性能和预测能力，能够灵活适应不同数据可用性场景，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Forecasting urban phenomena such as housing prices and public health
indicators requires the effective integration of various geospatial data.
Current methods primarily utilize task-specific models, while recent foundation
models for spatial representations often support only limited modalities and
lack multimodal fusion capabilities. To overcome these challenges, we present
UrbanFusion, a Geo-Foundation Model (GeoFM) that features Stochastic Multimodal
Fusion (SMF). The framework employs modality-specific encoders to process
different types of inputs, including street view imagery, remote sensing data,
cartographic maps, and points of interest (POIs) data. These multimodal inputs
are integrated via a Transformer-based fusion module that learns unified
representations. An extensive evaluation across 41 tasks in 56 cities worldwide
demonstrates UrbanFusion's strong generalization and predictive performance
compared to state-of-the-art GeoAI models. Specifically, it 1) outperforms
prior foundation models on location-encoding, 2) allows multimodal input during
inference, and 3) generalizes well to regions unseen during training.
UrbanFusion can flexibly utilize any subset of available modalities for a given
location during both pretraining and inference, enabling broad applicability
across diverse data availability scenarios. All source code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: T3former是一个新颖的拓扑时序Transformer模型，通过滑动窗口拓扑和谱描述符作为主要token，使用专门的描述符注意力机制，在时序图分类任务中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时序图分类在网络安全、脑连接分析等领域很重要，但现有方法存在丢失细粒度时序信息、难以处理长程依赖、过平滑和过压缩等问题。

Method: 提出T3former模型，利用滑动窗口拓扑和谱描述符作为主要token，通过描述符注意力机制进行集成，避免刚性离散化，实现跨模态融合。

Result: 在动态社交网络、脑功能连接数据集和交通网络等多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，并提供在时序和结构扰动下的稳定性理论保证。

Conclusion: 结合拓扑和谱洞察力能够推进时序图学习的前沿，T3former展示了这种方法的强大能力。

Abstract: Temporal graph classification plays a critical role in applications such as
cybersecurity, brain connectivity analysis, social dynamics, and traffic
monitoring. Despite its significance, this problem remains underexplored
compared to temporal link prediction or node forecasting. Existing methods
often rely on snapshot-based or recurrent architectures that either lose
fine-grained temporal information or struggle with long-range dependencies.
Moreover, local message-passing approaches suffer from oversmoothing and
oversquashing, limiting their ability to capture complex temporal structures.
  We introduce T3former, a novel Topological Temporal Transformer that
leverages sliding-window topological and spectral descriptors as first-class
tokens, integrated via a specialized Descriptor-Attention mechanism. This
design preserves temporal fidelity, enhances robustness, and enables principled
cross-modal fusion without rigid discretization. T3former achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, including dynamic
social networks, brain functional connectivity datasets, and traffic networks.
It also offers theoretical guarantees of stability under temporal and
structural perturbations. Our results highlight the power of combining
topological and spectral insights for advancing the frontier of temporal graph
learning.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本研究评估了基于protégé效应的干预措施对管理数字压力的效果，发现将认知参与转化为行为改变具有挑战性，特别是在面对根深蒂固的数字习惯和社会强化的压力源时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索protégé效应（通过教学来学习）是否也能支持新行为的获取，特别是在管理数字压力方面。

Method: 将137名中度至高度数字压力的参与者分为四组：被动protégé组（提供教学材料）、主动protégé组（自行搜索准备教学内容）、数字素养组（接收类似内容和测验）和对照组。干预持续三周，每节聚焦一个数字压力成分。

Result: 研究发现将认知参与转化为行为改变具有挑战性，特别是在面对根深蒂固的数字习惯和社会强化的压力源时。

Conclusion: 基于protégé效应的干预在行为改变方面存在局限性，特别是在反思性数字福祉策略背景下。未来研究可探索互动形式以增强动机和影响力。

Abstract: The prot\'eg\'ee effect suggests that individuals learn more effectively when
they teach a subject. While this has shown potential for acquiring knowledge
and skills, can it also support acquiring a new behaviour? This study evaluated
a prot\'eg\'e-based intervention designed to manage digital stress. Over three
weeks, 137 participants with moderate to high digital stress were assigned to
four groups. Two were prot\'eg\'ee-based: a passive group, given material to
teach, and an active group, received headlines and had to search for and
prepare teaching content. Both groups completed three sessions, each focused on
one digital stress component: availability demand stress, approval anxiety, and
fear of missing out. A digital literacy group received similar content and
quizzes, and a control group. Outcomes measured included digital stress,
problematic social media use, word-of-mouth about its management, and issue
involvement. Findings highlight the challenge of translating cognitive
engagement into behavioural change, especially amid persistent digital habits
and socially reinforced stressors. Results offer insights into the limitations
of interventions based on the prot\'eg\'ee effect when applied to behaviour
change, particularly in the context of reflective digital wellbeing strategies.
Future research could explore interactive formats, such as peer engagement or
self-regulatory elements, to enhance motivation and impact.

Motivation: 当前可访问性检查器主要评估静态或机械生成的上下文，无法捕捉影响移动应用功能的常见可访问性错误

Method: 包含三个组件：任务生成器从应用屏幕构建交互任务，任务执行器使用带屏幕阅读器代理的代理执行任务，可访问性分析器通过检查交互轨迹检测和报告错误

Result: 在真实应用评估中检测到54个应用屏幕中的48个功能错误，而现有检查器只能检测4-20个错误

Conclusion: TaskAudit能够检测现有工作无法发现的常见错误模式，包括标签功能不匹配、混乱导航和不适当反馈

Abstract: Accessibility checkers are tools in support of accessible app development and
their use is encouraged by accessibility best practices. However, most current
checkers evaluate static or mechanically-generated contexts, failing to capture
common accessibility errors impacting mobile app functionality. We present
TaskAudit, an accessibility evaluation system that focuses on detecting
functiona11ity errors through simulated interactions. TaskAudit comprises three
components: a Task Generator that constructs interactive tasks from app
screens, a Task Executor that uses agents with a screen reader proxy to perform
these tasks, and an Accessibility Analyzer that detects and reports
accessibility errors by examining interaction traces. Evaluation on real-world
apps shows that our strategy detects 48 functiona11ity errors from 54 app
screens, compared to between 4 and 20 with existing checkers. Our analysis
demonstrates common error patterns that TaskAudit can detect in addition to
prior work, including label-functionality mismatch, cluttered navigation, and
inappropriate feedback.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着VR设备普及，越来越多无经验的用户使用VR系统。自动检测用户对VR的熟悉度可以实现实时自适应训练和界面调整，减少用户挫败感并提高任务表现。

Method: 进行包含26名参与者的试点研究，使用基于密码开门任务，分析手部运动模式。采用先进的深度学习分类器进行VR熟悉度自动检测，比较控制器和手动追踪两种交互方式。

Result: 手动追踪交互准确率92.05%，控制器交互准确率83.42%。跨设备评估准确率78.89%，混合设备评估准确率94.19%。

Conclusion: 手部运动生物特征在实时检测用户VR熟悉度方面具有良好前景，为个性化和自适应VR体验铺平道路。

Abstract: As virtual reality (VR) devices become increasingly integrated into everyday
settings, a growing number of users without prior experience will engage with
VR systems. Automatically detecting a user's familiarity with VR as an
interaction medium enables real-time, adaptive training and interface
adjustments, minimizing user frustration and improving task performance. In
this study, we explore the automatic detection of VR familiarity by analyzing
hand movement patterns during a passcode-based door-opening task, which is a
well-known interaction in collaborative virtual environments such as meeting
rooms, offices, and healthcare spaces. While novice users may lack prior VR
experience, they are likely to be familiar with analogous real-world tasks
involving keypad entry. We conducted a pilot study with 26 participants, evenly
split between experienced and inexperienced VR users, who performed tasks using
both controller-based and hand-tracking interactions. Our approach uses
state-of-the-art deep classifiers for automatic VR familiarity detection,
achieving the highest accuracies of 92.05% and 83.42% for hand-tracking and
controller-based interactions, respectively. In the cross-device evaluation,
where classifiers trained on controller data were tested using hand-tracking
data, the model achieved an accuracy of 78.89%. The integration of both
modalities in the mixed-device evaluation obtained an accuracy of 94.19%. Our
results underline the promise of using hand movement biometrics for the
real-time detection of user familiarity in critical VR applications, paving the
way for personalized and adaptive VR experiences.

TL;DR: 提出基于深度学习的方法，使用VR中的连续眼动轨迹来检测视觉疲劳，在GazeBaseVR数据集上达到94%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长时间使用VR会导致视觉疲劳，影响用户体验和安全性。现有方法依赖主观问卷或侵入式生理信号，限制了可扩展性和实时应用。

Method: 使用GazeBaseVR数据集（407名参与者的双眼追踪数据），提取单眼注视角度，评估六种深度分类器。

Result: EKYT方法在需要高视觉注意力的任务（如视频观看和文本阅读）中达到94%准确率。注视方差和主观疲劳测量显示疲劳与非疲劳状态存在显著行为差异。

Conclusion: 眼动动态是VR中连续疲劳检测的可靠非侵入式方法，为人机交互自适应提供实际应用价值。

Abstract: Prolonged exposure to virtual reality (VR) systems leads to visual fatigue,
impairs user comfort, performance, and safety, particularly in high-stakes or
long-duration applications. Existing fatigue detection approaches rely on
subjective questionnaires or intrusive physiological signals, such as EEG,
heart rate, or eye-blink count, which limit their scalability and real-time
applicability. This paper introduces a deep learning-based study for detecting
visual fatigue using continuous eye-gaze trajectories recorded in VR. We use
the GazeBaseVR dataset comprising binocular eye-tracking data from 407
participants across five immersive tasks, extract cyclopean eye-gaze angles,
and evaluate six deep classifiers. Our results demonstrate that EKYT achieves
up to 94% accuracy, particularly in tasks demanding high visual attention, such
as video viewing and text reading. We further analyze gaze variance and
subjective fatigue measures, indicating significant behavioral differences
between fatigued and non-fatigued conditions. These findings establish eye-gaze
dynamics as a reliable and nonintrusive modality for continuous fatigue
detection in immersive VR, offering practical implications for adaptive
human-computer interactions.

TL;DR: 本研究将AT-GLLM和AT-PLLM量表翻译成阿拉伯语并在阿拉伯语人群中验证，结果显示该量表具有良好的信度和效度，可用于阿拉伯地区LLM态度研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在全球范围的应用增长，需要适应本地语境和语言的工具来准确测量阿拉伯世界对LLM的态度，现有AI态度测量工具为LLM态度测量提供了基础。

Method: 将英文的AT-GLLM和AT-PLLM量表翻译成阿拉伯语，并在249名阿拉伯语成人样本中进行验证，进行心理测量学分析。

Result: 阿拉伯语版本的量表显示出良好的信度和效度，确认了双因子结构、跨性别强测量不变性、良好的内部一致性，以及强收敛效度和区分效度。

Conclusion: 该量表将支持非西方语境下的研究，有助于绘制LLM感知的全球图景，并促进阿拉伯地区的本地化研究和政策制定。

Abstract: As the use of large language models (LLMs) becomes increasingly global,
understanding public attitudes toward these systems requires tools that are
adapted to local contexts and languages. In the Arab world, LLM adoption has
grown rapidly with both globally dominant platforms and regional ones like
Fanar and Jais offering Arabic-specific solutions. This highlights the need for
culturally and linguistically relevant scales to accurately measure attitudes
toward LLMs in the region. Tools assessing attitudes toward artificial
intelligence (AI) can provide a base for measuring attitudes specific to LLMs.
The 5-item Attitudes Toward Artificial Intelligence (ATAI) scale, which
measures two dimensions, the AI Fear and the AI Acceptance, has been recently
adopted and adapted to develop new instruments in English using a sample from
the UK: the Attitudes Toward General LLMs (AT-GLLM) and Attitudes Toward
Primary LLM (AT-PLLM) scales. In this paper, we translate the two scales,
AT-GLLM and AT-PLLM, and validate them using a sample of 249 Arabic-speaking
adults. The results show that the scale, translated into Arabic, is a reliable
and valid tool that can be used for the Arab population and language.
Psychometric analyses confirmed a two-factor structure, strong measurement
invariance across genders, and good internal reliability. The scales also
demonstrated strong convergent and discriminant validity. Our scales will
support research in a non-Western context, a much-needed effort to help draw a
global picture of LLM perceptions, and will also facilitate localized research
and policy-making in the Arab region.

Motivation: 当前研究人类与AI互动、协作和决策的实验基础设施不足：缺乏支持大规模实时多方研究的平台；部署需要定制化工程，限制了可复制性和可访问性；现有工具未将AI智能体视为一等参与者。

Method: 开发了Deliberate Lab开源平台，支持人类参与者和基于大语言模型的AI智能体参与实验。通过12个月的公开部署（88名实验者，9195名实验参与者），分析使用模式和工作流程，结合案例研究和深度访谈。

Result: 平台成功部署并得到广泛使用，降低了技术门槛，标准化了混合人机实验支持，扩展了研究集体决策和以人为本AI的方法库。

Conclusion: Deliberate Lab通过降低技术障碍和标准化混合人机实验支持，为研究集体决策和以人为本AI提供了新的方法工具。

Abstract: Social and behavioral scientists increasingly aim to study how humans
interact, collaborate, and make decisions alongside artificial intelligence.
However, the experimental infrastructure for such work remains underdeveloped:
(1) few platforms support real-time, multi-party studies at scale; (2) most
deployments require bespoke engineering, limiting replicability and
accessibility, and (3) existing tools do not treat AI agents as first-class
participants. We present Deliberate Lab, an open-source platform for
large-scale, real-time behavioral experiments that supports both human
participants and large language model (LLM)-based agents. We report on a
12-month public deployment of the platform (N=88 experimenters, N=9195
experiment participants), analyzing usage patterns and workflows. Case studies
and usage scenarios are aggregated from platform users, complemented by
in-depth interviews with select experimenters. By lowering technical barriers
and standardizing support for hybrid human-AI experimentation, Deliberate Lab
expands the methodological repertoire for studying collective decision-making
and human-centered AI.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 使用RAG-LLM生成人工自由职业者档案进行受控实验，发现在线自由职业市场中存在性别和地域偏见：女性在项目后阶段更容易获得不完美评分，而美国自由职业者始终受到偏爱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线自由职业市场虽然创造了公平环境，但用户档案中的个人信息仍可能导致歧视。现有研究多使用现有数据，难以控制变量并清晰观察性别或种族等因素的影响。

Method: 提出新方法，使用检索增强生成(RAG)与大型语言模型(LLM)创建逼真的人工自由职业者档案进行受控实验，分离个体因素，并利用传统统计方法和模拟招聘实验分析项目前后阶段。

Result: 性别方面：初始招聘决策无显著偏好，但女性自由职业者在项目后阶段明显更可能获得不完美评分；地域偏见方面：美国自由职业者始终受到偏爱，更可能被选中、被认为更具领导力，并在实际平台上获得更高评分。

Conclusion: 在线自由职业市场仍存在系统性偏见，需要进一步干预以确保公平竞争环境，RAG-LLM方法为研究此类偏见提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Online freelance marketplaces, a rapidly growing part of the global labor
market, are creating a fair environment where professional skills are the main
factor for hiring. While these platforms can reduce bias from traditional
hiring, the personal information in user profiles raises concerns about ongoing
discrimination. Past studies on this topic have mostly used existing data,
which makes it hard to control for other factors and clearly see the effect of
things like gender or race. To solve these problems, this paper presents a new
method that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a Large Language
Model (LLM) to create realistic, artificial freelancer profiles for controlled
experiments. This approach effectively separates individual factors, enabling a
clearer statistical analysis of how different variables influence the
freelancer project process. In addition to analyzing extracted data with
traditional statistical methods for post-project stage analysis, our research
utilizes a dataset with highly controlled variables, generated by an RAG-LLM,
to conduct a simulated hiring experiment for pre-project stage analysis. The
results of our experiments show that, regarding gender, while no significant
preference emerged in initial hiring decisions, female freelancers are
substantially more likely to receive imperfect ratings post-project stage.
Regarding regional bias, a strong and consistent preference favoring US-based
freelancers shows that people are more likely to be selected in the simulated
experiments, perceived as more leader-like, and receive higher ratings on the
live platform.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究往往单独处理用户状态感知或自适应交互设计，限制了我们对它们在VR中组合实施的理解，因此需要综合研究个性化交互在VR中的应用。

Method: 通过综合采用自适应技术的研究成果，分析不同应用领域中的适应机制，总结出一个五阶段概念框架来统一跨领域的适应机制。

Result: 分析揭示了新兴趋势，包括多模态传感器的集成、对用户状态推断的日益依赖，以及在响应性和透明度之间取得平衡的挑战。

Conclusion: 提出了开发更加以用户为中心的VR系统的未来方向。

Abstract: As virtual reality (VR) systems become increasingly more advanced, they are
likewise expected to respond intelligently and adapt to individual user states,
abilities, and preferences. Recent work has explored how VR can be adapted and
tailored to individual users. However, existing reviews tend to address either
user-state sensing or adaptive interaction design in isolation, limiting our
understanding of their combined implementation in VR. Therefore, in this paper,
we examine the growing research on personalized interaction in VR, with a
particular focus on utilizing participants' immersion information and
adaptation mechanisms to modify virtual environments and enhance engagement,
performance, or a specific goal. We synthesize findings from studies that
employ adaptive techniques across diverse application domains and summarize a
five-stage conceptual framework that unifies adaptive mechanisms across
domains. Our analysis reveals emerging trends, including the integration of
multimodal sensors, an increasing reliance on user state inference, and the
challenge of balancing responsiveness with transparency. We conclude by
proposing future directions for developing more user-centered VR systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种触觉优先的设计框架，探索如何将数据分析任务与触觉策略和编码选择相结合，以改进触觉图形的设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的触觉图形通常是从视觉图表设计改编而来，但这些编码在非视觉探索中效果不佳。盲人和低视力人群使用各种物理策略来解释触觉图表，这表明需要超越直接的视觉翻译，转向触觉优先的设计方法。

Method: 提出了一个推测性的触觉设计框架，探索数据分析任务如何与触觉策略和编码选择对齐。通过推测性模型展示了触觉感知语法如何指导COVID-19仪表板的设计。

Result: 该框架为生成触觉优先的图表设计提供了视角，并通过COVID-19仪表板场景展示了语法如何指导编码选择，更好地支持触觉格式中的比较、趋势检测和比例估计。

Conclusion: 提出了设计启示，并讨论了通过协同设计和基于任务的评估进行未来验证的方向，为触觉优先的数据可视化设计奠定了基础。

Abstract: Tactile graphics are often adapted from visual chart designs, yet many of
these encodings do not translate effectively to non-visual exploration. Blind
and low-vision (BLV) people employ a variety of physical strategies such as
measuring lengths with fingers or scanning for texture differences to interpret
tactile charts. These observations suggest an opportunity to move beyond direct
visual translation and toward a tactile-first design approach. We outline a
speculative tactile design framework that explores how data analysis tasks may
align with tactile strategies and encoding choices. While this framework is not
yet validated, it offers a lens for generating tactile-first chart designs and
sets the stage for future empirical exploration. We present speculative mockups
to illustrate how the Tactile Perceptual Grammar might guide the design of an
accessible COVID-19 dashboard. This scenario illustrates how the grammar can
guide encoding choices that better support comparison, trend detection, and
proportion estimation in tactile formats. We conclude with design implications
and a discussion of future validation through co-design and task-based
evaluation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Robotic manipulation policies often struggle to generalize to novel objects,
limiting their real-world utility. In contrast, cognitive science suggests that
children develop generalizable dexterous manipulation skills by mastering a
small set of simple toys and then applying that knowledge to more complex
items. Inspired by this, we study if similar generalization capabilities can
also be achieved by robots. Our results indicate robots can learn generalizable
grasping using randomly assembled objects that are composed from just four
shape primitives: spheres, cuboids, cylinders, and rings. We show that training
on these "toys" enables robust generalization to real-world objects, yielding
strong zero-shot performance. Crucially, we find the key to this generalization
is an object-centric visual representation induced by our proposed detection
pooling mechanism. Evaluated in both simulation and on physical robots, our
model achieves a 67% real-world grasping success rate on the YCB dataset,
outperforming state-of-the-art approaches that rely on substantially more
in-domain data. We further study how zero-shot generalization performance
scales by varying the number and diversity of training toys and the
demonstrations per toy. We believe this work offers a promising path to
scalable and generalizable learning in robotic manipulation. Demonstration
videos, code, checkpoints and our dataset are available on our project page:

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一框架，将高斯过程隐式表面（GPIS）作为控制屏障函数（CBF），利用传感器测量的安全样本来表示安全边界，并通过稀疏化解决计算复杂度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合水平集方法和控制屏障函数的安全技术，以及通过距离场表示几何形状的隐式表面表示，探索将隐式表面本身作为CBF的统一框架。

Method: 使用高斯过程隐式表面（GPIS）表示安全边界，利用安全样本（来自传感器测量）来调节GP。GP后验均值定义隐式安全表面，后验方差提供鲁棒安全边界。开发稀疏高斯CBF解决计算复杂度问题。

Result: 在7自由度机械臂操作斯坦福兔子和四旋翼在3D空间中导航物理椅子两个场景中验证，高斯CBF（含稀疏版本）实现了安全交互和无碰撞轨迹执行。

Conclusion: 高斯过程隐式表面可以成功用于合成控制屏障函数，为安全控制提供统一的隐式表面表示框架，稀疏化方法有效解决了计算复杂度问题。

Abstract: Level set methods underpin modern safety techniques such as control barrier
functions (CBFs), while also serving as implicit surface representations for
geometric shapes via distance fields. Inspired by these two paradigms, we
propose a unified framework where the implicit surface itself acts as a CBF. We
leverage Gaussian process (GP) implicit surface (GPIS) to represent the safety
boundaries, using safety samples which are derived from sensor measurements to
condition the GP. The GP posterior mean defines the implicit safety surface
(safety belief), while the posterior variance provides a robust safety margin.
Although GPs have favorable properties such as uncertainty estimation and
analytical tractability, they scale cubically with data. To alleviate this
issue, we develop a sparse solution called sparse Gaussian CBFs. To the best of
our knowledge, GPIS have not been explicitly used to synthesize CBFs. We
validate the approach on collision avoidance tasks in two settings: a simulated
7-DOF manipulator operating around the Stanford bunny, and a quadrotor
navigating in 3D around a physical chair. In both cases, Gaussian CBFs (with
and without sparsity) enable safe interaction and collision-free execution of
trajectories that would otherwise intersect the objects.

TL;DR: GMPPI是一种基于采样的控制器，结合几何SE(3)控制和动态参数调整，能够在跟踪敏捷轨迹的同时实现高速避障。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MPPI控制器在跟踪平滑低速轨迹时性能不足，且需要能够在复杂环境中实现高速自主避障。

Method: 采用几何SE(3)控制生成部分轨迹，引入变化的仿真时间步长和动态成本噪声参数，并与立体深度相机集成实现在线避障。

Result: 在仿真中位置误差与几何SE(3)控制器相当，在森林环境中能以13m/s速度避障；真实实验中能以10m/s速度跟踪轨迹并避障。

Conclusion: GMPPI控制器在保持敏捷轨迹跟踪能力的同时，显著提升了高速避障性能，是实现复杂环境中自主无人机飞行的关键进展。

Abstract: In this letter, we introduce Geometric Model Predictive Path Integral
(GMPPI), a sampling-based controller capable of tracking agile trajectories
while avoiding obstacles. In each iteration, GMPPI generates a large number of
candidate rollout trajectories and then averages them to create a nominal
control to be followed by the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). We propose using
geometric SE(3) control to generate part of the rollout trajectories,
significantly increasing precision in agile flight. Furthermore, we introduce
varying rollout simulation time step length and dynamic cost and noise
parameters, vastly improving tracking performance of smooth and low-speed
trajectories over an existing Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI)
implementation. Finally, we propose an integration of GMPPI with a stereo depth
camera, enabling online obstacle avoidance at high speeds, a crucial step
towards autonomous UAV flights in complex environments. The proposed controller
can track simulated agile reference trajectories with position error similar to
the geometric SE(3) controller. However, the same configuration of the proposed
controller can avoid obstacles in a simulated forest environment at speeds of
up to 13m/s, surpassing the performance of a state-of-the-art obstacle-aware
planner. In real-world experiments, GMPPI retains the capability to track agile
trajectories and avoids obstacles at speeds of up to 10m/s.

TL;DR: UNCAP是一种基于视觉语言模型的规划方法，通过轻量级自然语言消息进行CAV间通信，明确考虑感知不确定性，实现高效可扩展的安全协同规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么依赖高带宽原始传感器数据传输，要么忽略共享数据中的感知和规划不确定性，导致系统既不可扩展也不安全。

Method: 采用两阶段通信协议：首先识别最相关的车辆子集进行信息交换，然后选定的CAV传输定量表达感知不确定性的消息，通过选择性融合最大化互信息的消息来整合最相关信号。

Result: 实验显示通信带宽减少63%，驾驶安全评分提高31%，决策不确定性降低61%，近碰撞事件中的碰撞距离裕度增加四倍。

Conclusion: UNCAP通过不确定性引导的自然语言通信策略，显著提升了协同自动驾驶的可扩展性和安全性。

Abstract: Safe large-scale coordination of multiple cooperative connected autonomous
vehicles (CAVs) hinges on communication that is both efficient and
interpretable. Existing approaches either rely on transmitting high-bandwidth
raw sensor data streams or neglect perception and planning uncertainties
inherent in shared data, resulting in systems that are neither scalable nor
safe. To address these limitations, we propose Uncertainty-Guided Natural
Language Cooperative Autonomous Planning (UNCAP), a vision-language model-based
planning approach that enables CAVs to communicate via lightweight natural
language messages while explicitly accounting for perception uncertainty in
decision-making. UNCAP features a two-stage communication protocol: (i) an ego
CAV first identifies the subset of vehicles most relevant for information
exchange, and (ii) the selected CAVs then transmit messages that quantitatively
express their perception uncertainty. By selectively fusing messages that
maximize mutual information, this strategy allows the ego vehicle to integrate
only the most relevant signals into its decision-making, improving both the
scalability and reliability of cooperative planning. Experiments across diverse
driving scenarios show a 63% reduction in communication bandwidth with a 31%
increase in driving safety score, a 61% reduction in decision uncertainty, and
a four-fold increase in collision distance margin during near-miss events.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于经验库的3D物体路径规划方法，通过重用过去解决方案来加速新物体的路径规划，在窄通道场景中显著提升规划效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统采样规划器在窄通道场景中效率低下，且每次规划都从零开始，无法利用历史经验。在机器人应用中，不同物体需要重复通过相同环境，因此需要能够重用规划经验的方法。

Method: 构建过去解决方案库，规划新物体时在库中寻找最相似物体，将其路径作为近似解并进行变换调整，然后沿近似路径采样配置空间。

Result: 在窄通道场景中相比OMPL库的先进方法，规划时间减少高达85%，在传统规划器失败的情况下仍能找到解决方案。

Conclusion: 基于经验重用的路径规划方法能显著提升3D物体路径规划效率，特别是在窄通道场景中，该方法已开源发布。

Abstract: Path planning for 3D solid objects is a challenging problem, requiring a
search in a six-dimensional configuration space, which is, nevertheless,
essential in many robotic applications such as bin-picking and assembly. The
commonly used sampling-based planners, such as Rapidly-exploring Random Trees,
struggle with narrow passages where the sampling probability is low, increasing
the time needed to find a solution. In scenarios like robotic bin-picking,
various objects must be transported through the same environment. However,
traditional planners start from scratch each time, losing valuable information
gained during the planning process. We address this by using a library of past
solutions, allowing the reuse of previous experiences even when planning for a
new, previously unseen object. Paths for a set of objects are stored, and when
planning for a new object, we find the most similar one in the library and use
its paths as approximate solutions, adjusting for possible mutual
transformations. The configuration space is then sampled along the approximate
paths. Our method is tested in various narrow passage scenarios and compared
with state-of-the-art methods from the OMPL library. Results show significant
speed improvements (up to 85% decrease in the required time) of our method,
often finding a solution in cases where the other planners fail. Our
implementation of the proposed method is released as an open-source package.

Motivation: 旨在桥接基于零件的形状建模和功能装配设计，实现快速创建交互式铰接资产。通过重用现有零件，提高建模效率并确保功能完整性。

Method: 使用运动学感知的附着能量对齐多个铰接快照中的向量距离函数特征，并嵌入退火的黎曼Langevin动力学采样器中，处理非可微功能目标和约束。

Result: 框架生成了广泛的铰接形状，从垃圾桶轮子移植到汽车车身到多段灯具、齿轮驱动的划桨器和可重构家具，在几何、运动学和功能指标上显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 通过紧密耦合铰接感知的几何匹配和功能驱动的优化，Kinematic Kitbashing成功连接了基于零件的形状建模和功能装配设计，赋能快速创建交互式铰接资产。

Abstract: We introduce Kinematic Kitbashing, an automatic framework that synthesizes
functionality-aware articulated objects by reusing parts from existing models.
Given a kinematic graph with a small collection of articulated parts, our
optimizer jointly solves for the spatial placement of every part so that (i)
attachments remain geometrically sound over the entire range of motion and (ii)
the assembled object satisfies user-specified functional goals such as
collision-free actuation, reachability, or trajectory following. At its core is
a kinematics-aware attachment energy that aligns vector distance function
features sampled across multiple articulation snapshots. We embed this
attachment term within an annealed Riemannian Langevin dynamics sampler that
treats functionality objectives as additional energies, enabling robust global
exploration while accommodating non-differentiable functionality objectives and
constraints. Our framework produces a wide spectrum of assembled articulated
shapes, from trash-can wheels grafted onto car bodies to multi-segment lamps,
gear-driven paddlers, and reconfigurable furniture, and delivers strong
quantitative improvements over state-of-the-art baselines across geometric,
kinematic, and functional metrics. By tightly coupling articulation-aware
geometry matching with functionality-driven optimization, Kinematic Kitbashing
bridges part-based shape modeling and functional assembly design, empowering
rapid creation of interactive articulated assets.

Conclusion: Ω转弯控制器为有肢和无肢细长机器人提供了一种有效的身体驱动转弯策略。

Abstract: Elongate limbless robots have the potential to locomote through tightly
packed spaces for applications such as search-and-rescue and industrial
inspections. The capability to effectively and robustly maneuver elongate
limbless robots is crucial to realize such potential. However, there has been
limited research on turning strategies for such systems. To achieve effective
and robust turning performance in cluttered spaces, we take inspiration from a
microscopic nematode, C. elegans, which exhibits remarkable maneuverability in
rheologically complex environments partially because of its ability to perform
omega turns. Despite recent efforts to analyze omega turn kinematics, it
remains unknown if there exists a wave equation sufficient to prescribe an
omega turn, let alone its reconstruction on robot platforms. Here, using a
comparative theory-biology approach, we prescribe the omega turn as a
superposition of two traveling waves. With wave equations as a guideline, we
design a controller for limbless robots enabling robust and effective turning
behaviors in lab and cluttered field environments. Finally, we show that such
omega turn controllers can also generalize to elongate multi-legged robots,
demonstrating an alternative effective body-driven turning strategy for
elongate robots, with and without limbs.

Conclusion: Actron3D证明了从少量未标定人类视频中学习可迁移6-DoF操作技能的可行性，为机器人技能学习提供了高效的新途径。

Abstract: We present Actron3D, a framework that enables robots to acquire transferable
6-DoF manipulation skills from just a few monocular, uncalibrated, RGB-only
human videos. At its core lies the Neural Affordance Function, a compact
object-centric representation that distills actionable cues from diverse
uncalibrated videos-geometry, visual appearance, and affordance-into a
lightweight neural network, forming a memory bank of manipulation skills.
During deployment, we adopt a pipeline that retrieves relevant affordance
functions and transfers precise 6-DoF manipulation policies via coarse-to-fine
optimization, enabled by continuous queries to the multimodal features encoded
in the neural functions. Experiments in both simulation and the real world
demonstrate that Actron3D significantly outperforms prior methods, achieving a
14.9 percentage point improvement in average success rate across 13 tasks while
requiring only 2-3 demonstration videos per task.

TL;DR: 开发了一个硬件在环(HIL)实验测试台，用于模拟在轨服务、组装和制造(ISAM)操作，通过6自由度UR3e机械臂和1自由度导轨系统来验证空间运动、机器人操作和接触力学模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在轨服务、组装和制造(ISAM)操作对提高空间资产寿命和能力很重要，但机械臂在自由飞行卫星上的运动会产生复杂的扰动，需要实验验证动力学模型。

Method: 设计开发了新的硬件在环实验测试台，使用6自由度UR3e机械臂连接到卫星总线，卫星总线安装在1自由度导轨系统上，实现线性方向的自由运动。

Result: 该实验系统能够模拟ISAM操作，为空间运动、串行机器人操作和接触力学模型的验证提供实验平台。

Conclusion: 该硬件在环测试台解决了在空间环境中验证动力学模型的挑战，为ISAM操作的研究和开发提供了有效的实验手段。

Abstract: In-Space Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing (ISAM) is a set of emerging
operations that provides several benefits to improve the longevity, capacity,
mo- bility, and expandability of existing and future space assets. Serial
robotic ma- nipulators are particularly vital in accomplishing ISAM operations,
however, the complex perturbation forces and motions associated with movement
of a robotic arm on a free-flying satellite presents a complex controls problem
requiring addi- tional study. While many dynamical models are developed,
experimentally test- ing and validating these models is challenging given that
the models operate in space, where satellites have six-degrees-of-freedom
(6-DOF). This paper attempts to resolve those challenges by presenting the
design and development of a new hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experimental testbed
utilized to emulate ISAM. This emulation will be accomplished by means of a
6-DOF UR3e robotic arm attached to a satellite bus. This satellite bus is
mounted to a 1-DOF guide-rail system, en- abling the satellite bus and robotic
arm to move freely in one linear direction. This experimental ISAM emulation
system will explore and validate models for space motion, serial robot
manipulation, and contact mechanics.

Motivation: 当前构建视觉-语言-动作模型的方法往往增加复杂性，如修改词汇表或引入特殊动作头，而将动作直接表示为文本的简单策略尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出VLA-0模型，采用将动作直接表示为文本的设计，通过特定技术解锁其高性能潜力。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，VLA-0超越了所有使用相同机器人数据训练的方法，包括π0.5-KI、OpenVLA-OFT和SmolVLA，甚至在没有大规模机器人特定训练的情况下也优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 将动作表示为文本的简单策略在适当设计下非常有效，这为构建视觉-语言-动作模型提供了更简洁而强大的替代方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) hold immense promise for enabling
generalist robot manipulation. However, the best way to build them remains an
open question. Current approaches often add complexity, such as modifying the
existing vocabulary of a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with action tokens or
introducing special action heads. Curiously, the simplest strategy of
representing actions directly as text has remained largely unexplored. This
work introduces VLA-0 to investigate this idea. We find that VLA-0 is not only
effective; it is surprisingly powerful. With the right design, VLA-0
outperforms more involved models. On LIBERO, a popular benchmark for evaluating
VLAs, VLA-0 outperforms all existing methods trained on the same robotic data,
including $\pi_0.5$-KI, OpenVLA-OFT and SmolVLA. Furthermore, without
large-scale robotics-specific training, it outperforms methods trained on
large-scale robotic data, like $\pi_0.5$-KI, $\pi_0$, GR00T-N1 and MolmoAct.
These findings also translate to the real world, where VLA-0 outperforms
SmolVLA, a VLA model pre-trained on large-scale real data. This paper
summarizes our unexpected findings and spells out the specific techniques
required to unlock the high performance of this simple yet potent VLA design.

Conclusion: RoboHiMan为系统评估长时程操作中的组合泛化能力提供了新范式，有助于推动更适合现实世界应用的模型发展。

Abstract: Enabling robots to flexibly schedule and compose learned skills for novel
long-horizon manipulation under diverse perturbations remains a core challenge.
Early explorations with end-to-end VLA models show limited success, as these
models struggle to generalize beyond the training distribution. Hierarchical
approaches, where high-level planners generate subgoals for low-level policies,
bring certain improvements but still suffer under complex perturbations,
revealing limited capability in skill composition. However, existing benchmarks
primarily emphasize task completion in long-horizon settings, offering little
insight into compositional generalization, robustness, and the interplay
between planning and execution. To systematically investigate these gaps, we
propose RoboHiMan, a hierarchical evaluation paradigm for compositional
generalization in long-horizon manipulation. RoboHiMan introduces HiMan-Bench,
a benchmark of atomic and compositional tasks under diverse perturbations,
supported by a multi-level training dataset for analyzing progressive data
scaling, and proposes three evaluation paradigms (vanilla, decoupled, coupled)
that probe the necessity of skill composition and reveal bottlenecks in
hierarchical architectures. Experiments highlight clear capability gaps across
representative models and architectures, pointing to directions for advancing
models better suited to real-world long-horizon manipulation tasks. Videos and

Conclusion: 该方法通过点云分类和退化感知ICP算法，有效解决了LiDAR SLAM在特征稀疏环境中的退化问题，为纯LiDAR解决方案提供了更鲁棒的实现。

Abstract: LiDAR Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems are essential for
enabling precise navigation and environmental reconstruction across various
applications. Although current point-to-plane ICP algorithms perform effec-
tively in structured, feature-rich environments, they struggle in scenarios
with sparse features, repetitive geometric structures, and high-frequency
motion. This leads to degeneracy in 6- DOF pose estimation. Most
state-of-the-art algorithms address these challenges by incorporating
additional sensing modalities, but LiDAR-only solutions continue to face
limitations under such conditions. To address these issues, we propose a novel
Degeneracy-Aware Multi-Metric LiDAR Odometry and Map- ping (DAMM-LOAM) module.
Our system improves mapping accuracy through point cloud classification based
on surface normals and neighborhood analysis. Points are classified into
ground, walls, roof, edges, and non-planar points, enabling accurate
correspondences. A Degeneracy-based weighted least squares-based ICP algorithm
is then applied for accurate odom- etry estimation. Additionally, a Scan
Context based back-end is implemented to support robust loop closures.
DAMM-LOAM demonstrates significant improvements in odometry accuracy,
especially in indoor environments such as long corridors

TL;DR: FARM是一个模仿学习框架，通过整合高维触觉数据来推断触觉条件化的力信号，并定义基于力的动作空间，在接触丰富的操作任务中实现精确的力控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模仿学习方法通常只将视觉触觉反馈视为额外观察，而将施加的力视为夹爪命令的不可控后果。为了在操作易碎或可变形物体时实现精确的力控制，需要开发能够主动控制施加力的方法。

Method: 使用集成了GelSight Mini视觉触觉传感器的改进版手持UMI夹爪收集人类演示数据。开发了与手持版本几何匹配的驱动式UMI夹爪用于策略部署。FARM扩散策略在策略执行时联合预测机器人位姿、夹爪宽度和夹持力。

Result: FARM在三个具有不同力要求的任务（高力、低力和动态力适应）中优于多个基线方法，证明了其两个关键组件的优势：利用基于力的高维触觉观测和基于力的控制空间。

Conclusion: FARM框架通过整合高维触觉数据和力基控制空间，在接触丰富的操作任务中实现了精确的力控制，为处理易碎或可变形物体提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Contact-rich manipulation depends on applying the correct grasp forces
throughout the manipulation task, especially when handling fragile or
deformable objects. Most existing imitation learning approaches often treat
visuotactile feedback only as an additional observation, leaving applied forces
as an uncontrolled consequence of gripper commands. In this work, we present
Force-Aware Robotic Manipulation (FARM), an imitation learning framework that
integrates high-dimensional tactile data to infer tactile-conditioned force
signals, which in turn define a matching force-based action space. We collect
human demonstrations using a modified version of the handheld Universal
Manipulation Interface (UMI) gripper that integrates a GelSight Mini visual
tactile sensor. For deploying the learned policies, we developed an actuated
variant of the UMI gripper with geometry matching our handheld version. During
policy rollouts, the proposed FARM diffusion policy jointly predicts robot
pose, grip width, and grip force. FARM outperforms several baselines across
three tasks with distinct force requirements -- high-force, low-force, and
dynamic force adaptation -- demonstrating the advantages of its two key
components: leveraging force-grounded, high-dimensional tactile observations
and a force-based control space. The codebase and design files are open-sourced

Abstract: Modular Self-Reconfigurable Robot (MSRR) systems are a class of robots
capable of forming higher-level robotic systems by altering the topological
relationships between modules, offering enhanced adaptability and robustness in
various environments. This paper presents a novel MSRR called MODUR, featuring
dual-level reconfiguration capabilities designed to integrate reconfigurable
mechanisms into MSRR. Specifically, MODUR can perform high-level
self-reconfiguration among modules to create different configurations, while
each module is also able to change its shape to execute basic motions. The
design of MODUR primarily includes a compact connector and scissor linkage
groups that provide actuation, forming a parallel mechanism capable of
achieving both connector motion decoupling and adjacent position migration
capabilities. Furthermore, the workspace, considering the interdependent
connectors, is comprehensively analyzed, laying a theoretical foundation for
the design of the module's basic motion. Finally, the motion of MODUR is
validated through a series of experiments.

*Shingo Ayabe,Hiroshi Kera,Kazuhiko Kawamoto*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种离线到在线的强化学习框架，通过在离线训练后注入动作空间扰动进行对抗性微调，结合性能感知课程学习策略，提升策略在不确定环境下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习虽然样本效率高，但在面对执行器故障等动作空间扰动时策略表现脆弱，需要提升策略的鲁棒性和适应性。

Method: 采用离线到在线框架：先在干净数据上离线训练策略，然后进行对抗性微调，注入动作扰动诱导补偿行为；使用基于指数移动平均的性能感知课程自适应调整扰动概率。

Result: 在连续控制运动任务上的实验表明，该方法比纯离线基线显著提升鲁棒性，比从头训练收敛更快；匹配微调与评估条件时鲁棒性最强；自适应课程策略缓解了线性课程策略中的名义性能下降问题。

Conclusion: 对抗性微调能够在不确定环境中实现自适应和鲁棒控制，弥合离线效率与在线适应性之间的差距。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning enables sample-efficient policy acquisition
without risky online interaction, yet policies trained on static datasets
remain brittle under action-space perturbations such as actuator faults. This
study introduces an offline-to-online framework that trains policies on clean
data and then performs adversarial fine-tuning, where perturbations are
injected into executed actions to induce compensatory behavior and improve
resilience. A performance-aware curriculum further adjusts the perturbation
probability during training via an exponential-moving-average signal, balancing
robustness and stability throughout the learning process. Experiments on
continuous-control locomotion tasks demonstrate that the proposed method
consistently improves robustness over offline-only baselines and converges
faster than training from scratch. Matching the fine-tuning and evaluation
conditions yields the strongest robustness to action-space perturbations, while
the adaptive curriculum strategy mitigates the degradation of nominal
performance observed with the linear curriculum strategy. Overall, the results
show that adversarial fine-tuning enables adaptive and robust control under
uncertain environments, bridging the gap between offline efficiency and online
adaptability.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于迁移学习的膝关节角度预测框架，仅需少量步态周期数据即可在新受试者上实现准确预测，在多个数据集上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统EMG信号预测方法存在实时性差、测试条件不具代表性、需要大量数据等问题，需要开发更高效的预测框架。

Method: 开发轻量级注意力CNN-LSTM模型，在Georgia Tech数据集上预训练，然后迁移到UCI和SMLE数据集，结合EMG、运动学和交互力输入。

Result: 仅使用EMG输入时异常受试者的NMAE为6.8%（一步）和13.7%（50步）；结合历史角度后正常受试者NMAE降至3.1%和3.5%，异常受试者降至2.8%和7.5%；在SMLE外骨骼上达到1.09%和3.1%的NMAE。

Conclusion: 该框架在短期和长期康复场景中均表现出鲁棒性能和强泛化能力，为膝关节角度预测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Electromyography (EMG) signals are widely used for predicting body joint
angles through machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods. However,
these approaches often face challenges such as limited real-time applicability,
non-representative test conditions, and the need for large datasets to achieve
optimal performance. This paper presents a transfer-learning framework for knee
joint angle prediction that requires only a few gait cycles from new subjects.
Three datasets - Georgia Tech, the University of California Irvine (UCI), and
the Sharif Mechatronic Lab Exoskeleton (SMLE) - containing four EMG channels
relevant to knee motion were utilized. A lightweight attention-based CNN-LSTM
model was developed and pre-trained on the Georgia Tech dataset, then
transferred to the UCI and SMLE datasets. The proposed model achieved
Normalized Mean Absolute Errors (NMAE) of 6.8 percent and 13.7 percent for
one-step and 50-step predictions on abnormal subjects using EMG inputs alone.
Incorporating historical knee angles reduced the NMAE to 3.1 percent and 3.5
percent for normal subjects, and to 2.8 percent and 7.5 percent for abnormal
subjects. When further adapted to the SMLE exoskeleton with EMG, kinematic, and
interaction force inputs, the model achieved 1.09 percent and 3.1 percent NMAE
for one- and 50-step predictions, respectively. These results demonstrate
robust performance and strong generalization for both short- and long-term
rehabilitation scenarios.

TL;DR: 该研究通过在振荡桥梁上训练四足机器人，使用强化学习提升其在动态地面扰动下的运动鲁棒性，实现了从仿真到真实世界的零样本迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 四足机器人在崎岖地形导航表现出色，但在垂直地面扰动（如振荡表面）下的性能研究不足，需要探索如何增强其在这种动态环境中的运动鲁棒性。

Method: 使用PPO强化学习算法在MuJoCo仿真中训练Unitree Go2机器人，在13.24米钢混振荡桥梁上进行训练，结合5种步态和3种训练条件（刚性桥梁和两种不同高度调节策略的振荡桥梁），并通过域随机化实现零样本真实世界迁移。

Result: 在振荡桥梁上训练的策略比在刚性表面上训练的策略表现出更好的稳定性和适应性，即使没有事先接触过桥梁也能实现鲁棒的步态模式。

Conclusion: 基于仿真的强化学习能够显著提升四足机器人在动态地面扰动下的运动能力，为设计能够穿越振动环境的机器人提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Legged robots, particularly quadrupeds, excel at navigating rough terrains,
yet their performance under vertical ground perturbations, such as those from
oscillating surfaces, remains underexplored. This study introduces a novel
approach to enhance quadruped locomotion robustness by training the Unitree Go2
robot on an oscillating bridge - a 13.24-meter steel-and-concrete structure
with a 2.0 Hz eigenfrequency designed to perturb locomotion. Using
Reinforcement Learning (RL) with the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
algorithm in a MuJoCo simulation, we trained 15 distinct locomotion policies,
combining five gaits (trot, pace, bound, free, default) with three training
conditions: rigid bridge and two oscillating bridge setups with differing
height regulation strategies (relative to bridge surface or ground). Domain
randomization ensured zero-shot transfer to the real-world bridge. Our results
demonstrate that policies trained on the oscillating bridge exhibit superior
stability and adaptability compared to those trained on rigid surfaces. Our
framework enables robust gait patterns even without prior bridge exposure.
These findings highlight the potential of simulation-based RL to improve
quadruped locomotion during dynamic ground perturbations, offering insights for
designing robots capable of traversing vibrating environments.

TL;DR: Hockens-A Hand是一种新型欠驱动自适应机器人手，通过集成Hoeckens机构、双平行四边形连杆和专用四杆机构，仅需单个线性执行器即可实现三种自适应抓取模式：平行捏取、非对称舀取和包络抓取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种能够在非结构化环境中实现自适应和顺应性抓取的机器人手，通过被动机械智能减少执行器数量，提高系统的鲁棒性和适应性。

Method: 结合Hoeckens机构提供顺应性，双平行四边形连杆确保指尖线接触，四杆放大系统实现不同抓取模式间的自然转换。通过详细运动学分析优化推角和连杆长度，并使用3D打印原型进行实验验证。

Conclusion: Hockens-A Hand通过创新的机械设计实现了高效的自适应抓取，仅需单个执行器即可在非结构化环境中稳定抓取各种形状和大小的物体。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel underactuated adaptive robotic hand, Hockens-A
Hand, which integrates the Hoeckens mechanism, a double-parallelogram linkage,
and a specialized four-bar linkage to achieve three adaptive grasping modes:
parallel pinching, asymmetric scooping, and enveloping grasping. Hockens-A Hand
requires only a single linear actuator, leveraging passive mechanical
intelligence to ensure adaptability and compliance in unstructured
environments. Specifically, the vertical motion of the Hoeckens mechanism
introduces compliance, the double-parallelogram linkage ensures line contact at
the fingertip, and the four-bar amplification system enables natural
transitions between different grasping modes. Additionally, the inclusion of a
mesh-textured silicone phalanx further enhances the ability to envelop objects
of various shapes and sizes. This study employs detailed kinematic analysis to
optimize the push angle and design the linkage lengths for optimal performance.
Simulations validated the design by analyzing the fingertip motion and ensuring
smooth transitions between grasping modes. Furthermore, the grasping force was
analyzed using power equations to enhance the understanding of the system's
performance.Experimental validation using a 3D-printed prototype demonstrates
the three grasping modes of the hand in various scenarios under environmental
constraints, verifying its grasping stability and broad applicability.

Motivation: 开发一种能够在结构化环境中可靠抓取各种几何形状物体的紧凑、自适应且成本效益高的机器人抓手解决方案。

Method: 重新配置原始Hoecken连杆机构，用差动连杆替换一个构件，结合差动弹簧机制，保持指尖平行性，同时允许接触触发重构，无需额外驱动器。

Result: 原型实现约200mm的线性夹持跨度，在多种物体几何形状上可靠抓取，展示紧凑、自适应和成本效益高的特性。

Conclusion: Hoecken-D Hand为无结构环境中的操作提供了一种有效的紧凑、自适应且成本效益高的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents the Hoecken-D Hand, an underactuated robotic gripper that
combines a modified Hoecken linkage with a differential spring mechanism to
achieve both linear parallel pinching and a mid-stroke transition to adaptive
envelope. The original Hoecken linkage is reconfigured by replacing one member
with differential links, preserving straight-line guidance while enabling
contact-triggered reconfiguration without additional actuators. A
double-parallelogram arrangement maintains fingertip parallelism during
conventional pinching, whereas the differential mechanism allows one finger to
wrap inward upon encountering an obstacle, improving stability on irregular or
thin objects. The mechanism can be driven by a single linear actuator,
minimizing complexity and cost; in our prototype, each finger is driven by its
own linear actuator for simplicity. We perform kinematic modeling and force
analysis to characterize grasp performance, including simulated grasping forces
and spring-opening behavior under varying geometric parameters. The design was
prototyped using PLA-based 3D printing, achieving a linear pinching span of
approximately 200 mm. Preliminary tests demonstrate reliable grasping in both
modes across a wide range of object geometries, highlighting the Hoecken-D Hand
as a compact, adaptable, and cost-effective solution for manipulation in
unstructured environments.

TL;DR: 提出一个仅使用触觉数据同时确定刚性物体形状和位置的学习与探索框架，通过优化物理约束违反的损失函数来学习立方体和凸多面体几何，结合预期信息增益最大化实现高效探索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用机器人操作需要处理未见过的物体。在测试时学习物理精确模型可以在数据效率、可预测性和任务间重用方面提供显著优势。触觉感知可以补充视觉感知对遮挡的鲁棒性，但其时间稀疏性需要仔细的在线探索以保持数据效率。

Method: 基于接触丰富系统识别的最新进展，制定了一个惩罚物理约束违反的损失函数，而不引入刚体接触固有的数值刚度。通过优化该损失函数，可以在首次接触后仅用不到10秒的随机收集数据学习立方体和凸多面体几何。探索方案旨在最大化预期信息增益。

Result: 在仿真和真实机器人实验中，该方法实现了显著更快的学习速度，能够用少量数据有效学习物体形状和位置。

Conclusion: 该框架证明了仅使用触觉数据就能高效学习物体几何和位置的可能性，为机器人操作提供了数据效率高的解决方案。

Abstract: General robot manipulation requires the handling of previously unseen
objects. Learning a physically accurate model at test time can provide
significant benefits in data efficiency, predictability, and reuse between
tasks. Tactile sensing can compliment vision with its robustness to occlusion,
but its temporal sparsity necessitates careful online exploration to maintain
data efficiency. Direct contact can also cause an unrestrained object to move,
requiring both shape and location estimation. In this work, we propose a
learning and exploration framework that uses only tactile data to
simultaneously determine the shape and location of rigid objects with minimal
robot motion. We build on recent advances in contact-rich system identification
to formulate a loss function that penalizes physical constraint violation
without introducing the numerical stiffness inherent in rigid-body contact.
Optimizing this loss, we can learn cuboid and convex polyhedral geometries with
less than 10s of randomly collected data after first contact. Our exploration
scheme seeks to maximize Expected Information Gain and results in significantly
faster learning in both simulated and real-robot experiments. More information

Abstract: Building an online 3D LiDAR mapping system that produces a detailed surface
reconstruction while remaining computationally efficient is a challenging task.
In this paper, we present PlanarMesh, a novel incremental, mesh-based LiDAR
reconstruction system that adaptively adjusts mesh resolution to achieve
compact, detailed reconstructions in real-time. It introduces a new
representation, planar-mesh, which combines plane modeling and meshing to
capture both large surfaces and detailed geometry. The planar-mesh can be
incrementally updated considering both local surface curvature and free-space
information from sensor measurements. We employ a multi-threaded architecture
with a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) for efficient data storage and fast
search operations, enabling real-time performance. Experimental results show
that our method achieves reconstruction accuracy on par with, or exceeding,
state-of-the-art techniques-including truncated signed distance functions,
occupancy mapping, and voxel-based meshing-while producing smaller output file
sizes (10 times smaller than raw input and more than 5 times smaller than
mesh-based methods) and maintaining real-time performance (around 2 Hz for a
64-beam sensor).

Abstract: Properly handling delicate produce with robotic manipulators is a major part
of the future role of automation in agricultural harvesting and processing.
Grasping with the correct amount of force is crucial in not only ensuring
proper grip on the object, but also to avoid damaging or bruising the product.
In this work, a flexible pressure sensor that is both low cost and easy to
fabricate is integrated with robotic grippers for working with produce of
varying shapes, sizes, and stiffnesses. The sensor is successfully integrated
with both a rigid robotic gripper, as well as a pneumatically actuated soft
finger. Furthermore, an algorithm is proposed for accelerated estimation of the
steady-state value of the sensor output based on the transient response data,
to enable real-time applications. The sensor is shown to be effective in
incorporating feedback to correctly grasp objects of unknown sizes and
stiffnesses. At the same time, the sensor provides estimates for these values
which can be utilized for identification of qualities such as ripeness levels
and bruising. It is also shown to be able to provide force feedback for objects
of variable stiffnesses. This enables future use not only for produce
identification, but also for tasks such as quality control and selective
distribution based on ripeness levels.

Conclusion: 该可视化方法能有效揭示点云配准中的局部差异模式，帮助分析师逐步聚焦于更小的差异问题。

Abstract: In this paper we introduce a visualization methodology to aid a human analyst
in classifying adversity modes that impact lidar scan matching. Our methodology
is intended for offline rather than real-time analysis. The method generates a
vector-field plot that characterizes local discrepancies between a pair of

difficult for the analyst to extract from raw point-cloud data. After
introducing our methodology, we apply the process to two proof-of-concept
examples: one a simulation study and the other a field experiment. For both
data sets, a human analyst was able to reason about a series of adversity
mechanisms and iteratively remove those mechanisms from the raw data, to help
focus attention on progressively smaller discrepancies.

Abstract: Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models report impressive success rates on
robotic manipulation benchmarks, yet these results may mask fundamental
weaknesses in robustness. We perform a systematic vulnerability analysis by
introducing controlled perturbations across seven dimensions: objects layout,
camera viewpoints, robot initial states, language instructions, light
conditions, background textures and sensor noise. We comprehensively analyzed
multiple state-of-the-art models and revealed consistent brittleness beneath
apparent competence. Our analysis exposes critical weaknesses: models exhibit
extreme sensitivity to perturbation factors, including camera viewpoints and
robot initial states, with performance dropping from 95% to below 30% under
modest perturbations. Surprisingly, models are largely insensitive to language
variations, with further experiments revealing that models tend to ignore
language instructions completely. Our findings challenge the assumption that
high benchmark scores equate to true competency and highlight the need for
evaluation practices that assess reliability under realistic variation.

Abstract: Drone technology is proliferating in many industries, including agriculture,
logistics, defense, infrastructure, and environmental monitoring. Vision-based
autonomy is one of its key enablers, particularly for real-world applications.
This is essential for operating in novel, unstructured environments where
traditional navigation methods may be unavailable. Autonomous drone racing has
become the de facto benchmark for such systems. State-of-the-art research has
shown that autonomous systems can surpass human-level performance in racing
arenas. However, direct applicability to commercial and field operations is
still limited as current systems are often trained and evaluated in highly
controlled environments. In our contribution, the system's capabilities are
analyzed within a controlled environment -- where external tracking is
available for ground-truth comparison -- but also demonstrated in a
challenging, uninstrumented environment -- where ground-truth measurements were
never available. We show that our approach can match the performance of
professional human pilots in both scenarios. We also publicly release the data
from the flights carried out by our approach and a world-class human pilot.

Abstract: Although digital fabrication processes at the desktop scale have become
proficient and prolific, systems aimed at producing larger-scale structures are
still typically complex, expensive, and unreliable. In this work, we present an
approach for the fabrication of scalable macroscale structures using simple
robots and interlocking lattice building blocks. A target structure is first
voxelized so that it can be populated with an architected lattice. These voxels
are then grouped into larger interconnected blocks, which are produced using
standard digital fabrication processes, leveraging their capability to produce
highly complex geometries at a small scale. These blocks, on the size scale of
tens of centimeters, are then fed to mobile relative robots that are able to
traverse over the structure and place new blocks to form structures on the
meter scale. To facilitate the assembly of large structures, we introduce a
live digital twin simulation tool for controlling and coordinating assembly

design, interaction, or intervention. To improve assembly throughput, we
introduce a new modular assembly robot, designed for hierarchical voxel

hierarchical blocking, path planning, and robotic fabrication of a set of

TL;DR: InternVLA-M1是一个统一的空间定位和机器人控制框架，通过空间引导的视觉-语言-动作训练，将空间定位作为指令和机器人动作之间的关键连接。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推动指令跟随机器人向可扩展、通用智能发展，解决传统方法在空间推理和动作生成之间的脱节问题。

Method: 采用两阶段流水线：1）在230万+空间推理数据上进行空间定位预训练，确定"在哪里行动"；2）通过即插即用的空间提示进行空间引导的动作后训练，决定"如何行动"。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著优于无空间引导的变体：SimplerEnv Google Robot提升14.6%，WidowX提升17%，LIBERO Franka提升4.3%。在真实世界集群拾放任务中提升7.3%，通过合成协同训练在未见物体和新配置上提升20.6%。

Conclusion: 空间引导训练是构建可扩展和鲁棒的通用机器人的统一原则，在长视野推理密集型场景中超越现有工作10%以上。

Abstract: We introduce InternVLA-M1, a unified framework for spatial grounding and
robot control that advances instruction-following robots toward scalable,
general-purpose intelligence. Its core idea is spatially guided
vision-language-action training, where spatial grounding serves as the critical
link between instructions and robot actions. InternVLA-M1 employs a two-stage
pipeline: (i) spatial grounding pre-training on over 2.3M spatial reasoning
data to determine ``where to act'' by aligning instructions with visual,
embodiment-agnostic positions, and (ii) spatially guided action post-training
to decide ``how to act'' by generating embodiment-aware actions through
plug-and-play spatial prompting. This spatially guided training recipe yields
consistent gains: InternVLA-M1 outperforms its variant without spatial guidance
by +14.6% on SimplerEnv Google Robot, +17% on WidowX, and +4.3% on LIBERO
Franka, while demonstrating stronger spatial reasoning capability in box,
point, and trace prediction. To further scale instruction following, we built a
simulation engine to collect 244K generalizable pick-and-place episodes,
enabling a 6.2% average improvement across 200 tasks and 3K+ objects. In
real-world clustered pick-and-place, InternVLA-M1 improved by 7.3%, and with
synthetic co-training, achieved +20.6% on unseen objects and novel
configurations. Moreover, in long-horizon reasoning-intensive scenarios, it
surpassed existing works by over 10%. These results highlight spatially guided
training as a unifying principle for scalable and resilient generalist robots.

### [242] [From Literal to Liberal: A Meta-Prompting Framework for Eliciting Human-Aligned Exception Handling in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12864)
*Imran Khan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了RID框架，一种零样本元提示技术，通过结构化认知模式让LLM在规则与意图冲突时做出符合人类常识的决策，显著提升对齐度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为智能体推理引擎存在规则刚性缺陷，过度遵循显式规则导致决策与人类常识和意图不符，而监督微调方法计算成本高且难以普及。

Method: RID框架通过结构化认知模式分解任务、分类规则、权衡冲突结果并最终决策，是一种低计算成本的元提示技术。

Result: 在20个需要微妙判断的场景中，RID框架达到95%的人类对齐分数，显著优于基线(80%)和思维链提示(75%)，产生更高质量的意图驱动推理。

Conclusion: RID框架提供了一种实用、可访问且有效的方法，引导LLM从字面指令遵循转向自由的目标导向推理，为构建更可靠实用的AI智能体铺平道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as the reasoning
engines for agentic AI systems, yet they exhibit a critical flaw: a rigid
adherence to explicit rules that leads to decisions misaligned with human
common sense and intent. This "rule-rigidity" is a significant barrier to
building trustworthy autonomous agents. While prior work has shown that
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with human explanations can mitigate this issue,
SFT is computationally expensive and inaccessible to many practitioners. To
address this gap, we introduce the Rule-Intent Distinction (RID) Framework, a
novel, low-compute meta-prompting technique designed to elicit human-aligned
exception handling in LLMs in a zero-shot manner. The RID framework provides
the model with a structured cognitive schema for deconstructing tasks,
classifying rules, weighing conflicting outcomes, and justifying its final
decision. We evaluated the RID framework against baseline and Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) prompting on a custom benchmark of 20 scenarios requiring nuanced
judgment across diverse domains. Our human-verified results demonstrate that
the RID framework significantly improves performance, achieving a 95% Human
Alignment Score (HAS), compared to 80% for the baseline and 75% for CoT.
Furthermore, it consistently produces higher-quality, intent-driven reasoning.
This work presents a practical, accessible, and effective method for steering
LLMs from literal instruction-following to liberal, goal-oriented reasoning,
paving the way for more reliable and pragmatic AI agents.

TL;DR: DeepPlanner是一个端到端的强化学习框架，通过熵基优势函数和选择性样本加权，有效增强深度研究代理的规划能力，在七个基准测试中实现了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么依赖推理阶段的隐式规划，要么引入显式规划器但未系统优化规划阶段。研究发现标准强化学习下规划令牌的熵显著高于其他动作令牌，揭示了未优化的不确定决策点。

Method: 提出DeepPlanner框架：1）使用基于熵的优势函数在令牌级别分配更大更新给高熵令牌；2）选择性加权规划密集型样本的样本级优势。

Result: 在七个深度研究基准测试中，DeepPlanner提高了规划质量，并以显著更低的训练预算实现了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: DeepPlanner通过系统优化规划阶段，有效解决了大语言模型在复杂任务中规划能力不足的问题，证明了熵基优化策略的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) augmented with multi-step reasoning and action
generation abilities have shown promise in leveraging external tools to tackle
complex tasks that require long-horizon planning. However, existing approaches
either rely on implicit planning in the reasoning stage or introduce explicit
planners without systematically addressing how to optimize the planning stage.
As evidence, we observe that under vanilla reinforcement learning (RL),
planning tokens exhibit significantly higher entropy than other action tokens,
revealing uncertain decision points that remain under-optimized. To address
this, we propose DeepPlanner, an end-to-end RL framework that effectively
enhances the planning capabilities of deep research agents. Our approach shapes
token-level advantage with an entropy-based term to allocate larger updates to
high entropy tokens, and selectively upweights sample-level advantages for
planning-intensive rollouts. Extensive experiments across seven deep research
benchmarks demonstrate that DeepPlanner improves planning quality and achieves
state-of-the-art results under a substantially lower training budget.

TL;DR: Sentinel是首个基于形式化时序逻辑的LLM具身智能体物理安全评估框架，通过语义、规划和轨迹三个层次进行多级验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖启发式规则或主观LLM判断，缺乏对物理安全的严格形式化评估。需要建立能够精确指定状态不变性、时序依赖和时间约束的形式化框架。

Method: 使用时序逻辑形式化安全需求，构建三级验证管道：语义级验证LLM对安全需求的理解；规划级验证高层动作计划；轨迹级将执行轨迹合并为计算树进行最终安全检查。

Result: 在VirtualHome和ALFRED环境中评估了多个LLM具身智能体，暴露了先前方法忽略的安全违规，并揭示了失败模式。

Conclusion: 通过将物理安全基于时序逻辑并在多个层次应用验证方法，Sentinel为系统评估LLM具身智能体在物理环境中的安全性提供了严格基础。

Abstract: We present Sentinel, the first framework for formally evaluating the physical
safety of Large Language Model(LLM-based) embodied agents across the semantic,
plan, and trajectory levels. Unlike prior methods that rely on heuristic rules
or subjective LLM judgments, Sentinel grounds practical safety requirements in
formal temporal logic (TL) semantics that can precisely specify state
invariants, temporal dependencies, and timing constraints. It then employs a
multi-level verification pipeline where (i) at the semantic level, intuitive
natural language safety requirements are formalized into TL formulas and the
LLM agent's understanding of these requirements is probed for alignment with
the TL formulas; (ii) at the plan level, high-level action plans and subgoals
generated by the LLM agent are verified against the TL formulas to detect
unsafe plans before execution; and (iii) at the trajectory level, multiple
execution trajectories are merged into a computation tree and efficiently
verified against physically-detailed TL specifications for a final safety
check. We apply Sentinel in VirtualHome and ALFRED, and formally evaluate
multiple LLM-based embodied agents against diverse safety requirements. Our
experiments show that by grounding physical safety in temporal logic and
applying verification methods across multiple levels, Sentinel provides a
rigorous foundation for systematically evaluating LLM-based embodied agents in
physical environments, exposing safety violations overlooked by previous
methods and offering insights into their failure modes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 两车事故占道路事故约70%，但现有DHA数据因人工编码不一致且耗时而不够可靠，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 使用MTCF五年两车事故数据，微调Llama 3.2 1B模型处理详细事故叙述，并与传统机器学习分类器对比。

Result: 微调LLM达到80%总体准确率，优于所有基线模型，在数据不平衡场景表现更佳。概率推理分析显示不同场景下DHA概率变化。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模自动DHA检测提供稳健可解释的解决方案，为交通安全分析和干预提供新机会。

Abstract: Vehicle crashes involve complex interactions between road users, split-second
decisions, and challenging environmental conditions. Among these, two-vehicle
crashes are the most prevalent, accounting for approximately 70% of roadway
crashes and posing a significant challenge to traffic safety. Identifying
Driver Hazardous Action (DHA) is essential for understanding crash causation,
yet the reliability of DHA data in large-scale databases is limited by
inconsistent and labor-intensive manual coding practices. Here, we present an
innovative framework that leverages a fine-tuned large language model to
automatically infer DHAs from textual crash narratives, thereby improving the
validity and interpretability of DHA classifications. Using five years of
two-vehicle crash data from MTCF, we fine-tuned the Llama 3.2 1B model on
detailed crash narratives and benchmarked its performance against conventional
machine learning classifiers, including Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and a
neural network. The fine-tuned LLM achieved an overall accuracy of 80%,
surpassing all baseline models and demonstrating pronounced improvements in
scenarios with imbalanced data. To increase interpretability, we developed a
probabilistic reasoning approach, analyzing model output shifts across original
test sets and three targeted counterfactual scenarios: variations in driver
distraction and age. Our analysis revealed that introducing distraction for one
driver substantially increased the likelihood of "General Unsafe Driving";
distraction for both drivers maximized the probability of "Both Drivers Took
Hazardous Actions"; and assigning a teen driver markedly elevated the
probability of "Speed and Stopping Violations." Our framework and analytical
methods provide a robust and interpretable solution for large-scale automated
DHA detection, offering new opportunities for traffic safety analysis and
intervention.

TL;DR: 本文主张将时间序列分析重新构想为推理任务，利用LLMs的深层推理能力而非数值回归，强调因果结构和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的时间序列分析需要超越表面趋势，揭示驱动因素。现有LLM方法主要使用数值回归能力，忽视了其深层推理潜力。

Method: 将时间序列分析作为推理任务，利用LLMs整合多模态输入，优先考虑因果结构和可解释性。

Result: 这种方法使时间序列分析更接近人类对齐的理解，在复杂现实环境中实现透明和上下文感知的洞察。

Conclusion: 需要重新思考LLMs在时间序列分析中的角色，从数值回归转向因果推理，以实现更透明和可解释的分析。

Abstract: Traditional time series analysis has long relied on pattern recognition,
trained on static and well-established benchmarks. However, in real-world
settings -- where policies shift, human behavior adapts, and unexpected events
unfold -- effective analysis must go beyond surface-level trends to uncover the
actual forces driving them. The recent rise of Large Language Models (LLMs)
presents new opportunities for rethinking time series analysis by integrating
multimodal inputs. However, as the use of LLMs becomes popular, we must remain
cautious, asking why we use LLMs and how to exploit them effectively. Most
existing LLM-based methods still employ their numerical regression ability and
ignore their deeper reasoning potential. This paper argues for rethinking time
series with LLMs as a reasoning task that prioritizes causal structure and
explainability. This shift brings time series analysis closer to human-aligned
understanding, enabling transparent and context-aware insights in complex
real-world environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于偏好的奖励修复(PBRR)框架，通过从人类偏好中学习加性的、状态转移相关的修正项来自动修复人工设计的代理奖励函数，以解决奖励函数错配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工设计的奖励函数经常与人类真实目标不一致，导致奖励黑客问题；而从零学习奖励函数需要大量人类偏好数据，成本高昂。

Method: PBRR框架使用目标探索策略和新的偏好学习目标，通过学习加性的状态转移相关修正项来修复代理奖励函数。

Result: 在表格域中证明PBRR的累积遗憾与现有偏好强化学习方法相当；在奖励黑客基准测试中，PBRR优于从零学习奖励函数或其他修改方法的基线，需要更少的偏好数据即可学习高性能策略。

Conclusion: PBRR能有效修复错配的奖励函数，以较少的人类偏好数据实现策略对齐，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Human-designed reward functions for reinforcement learning (RL) agents are
frequently misaligned with the humans' true, unobservable objectives, and thus
act only as proxies. Optimizing for a misspecified proxy reward function often
induces reward hacking, resulting in a policy misaligned with the human's true
objectives. An alternative is to perform RL from human feedback, which involves
learning a reward function from scratch by collecting human preferences over
pairs of trajectories. However, building such datasets is costly. To address
the limitations of both approaches, we propose Preference-Based Reward Repair
(PBRR): an automated iterative framework that repairs a human-specified proxy
reward function by learning an additive, transition-dependent correction term
from preferences. A manually specified reward function can yield policies that
are highly suboptimal under the ground-truth objective, yet corrections on only
a few transitions may suffice to recover optimal performance. To identify and
correct for those transitions, PBRR uses a targeted exploration strategy and a
new preference-learning objective. We prove in tabular domains PBRR has a
cumulative regret that matches, up to constants, that of prior preference-based
RL methods. In addition, on a suite of reward-hacking benchmarks, PBRR
consistently outperforms baselines that learn a reward function from scratch
from preferences or modify the proxy reward function using other approaches,
requiring substantially fewer preferences to learn high performing policies.

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的智能体在情感认知方面存在严重局限：无法模拟连接虚拟与现实服务的有限理性；缺乏经过实证验证的情感整合机制。

Method: 构建情感认知框架，包含欲望生成和目标管理，在专有多智能体交互环境中实现完整的决策过程建模。

Result: 实验表明，受该框架控制的智能体不仅表现出与其情感状态一致的行为，而且在与其他智能体类型的比较中展现出更高的生态效度，决策结果更接近人类行为模式。

Conclusion: 该情感认知框架成功实现了LLM智能体与人类的情感对齐，显著提升了智能体在复杂社会系统中的行为真实性。

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has enabled agents to represent
virtual humans in societal simulations, facilitating diverse interactions
within complex social systems. However, existing LLM-based agents exhibit
severe limitations in affective cognition: They fail to simulate the bounded
rationality essential for bridging virtual and real-world services; They lack
empirically validated integration mechanisms embedding emotions within agent
decision architectures. This paper constructs an emotional cognition framework
incorporating desire generation and objective management, designed to achieve
emotion alignment between LLM-based agents and humans, modeling the complete
decision-making process of LLM-based agents, encompassing state evolution,
desire generation, objective optimization, decision generation, and action
execution. This study implements the proposed framework within our proprietary
multi-agent interaction environment. Experimental results demonstrate that
agents governed by our framework not only exhibit behaviors congruent with
their emotional states but also, in comparative assessments against other agent
types, demonstrate superior ecological validity and generate decision outcomes
that significantly more closely approximate human behavioral patterns.

Motivation: 虽然链式思维提示和深度推理能提升复杂任务性能，但对所有问题都应用深度推理计算成本过高。

Method: 小型LLM先生成初始答案，大型LLM进行验证，如果正确则直接采用，否则大型LLM执行深度推理。

Result: 对于简单问题，大型LLM的计算成本降低超过50%，准确率损失可忽略不计，同时在复杂任务上保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: 该互补代理系统能有效平衡计算效率和任务性能，为LLM应用提供了成本效益高的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate that
chain-of-thought prompting and deep reasoning substantially enhance performance
on complex tasks, and multi-agent systems can further improve accuracy by
enabling model debates. However, applying deep reasoning to all problems is
computationally expensive. To mitigate these costs, we propose a complementary
agent system integrating small and large LLMs. The small LLM first generates an
initial answer, which is then verified by the large LLM. If correct, the answer
is adopted directly; otherwise, the large LLM performs in-depth reasoning.
Experimental results show that, for simple problems, our approach reduces the
computational cost of the large LLM by more than 50% with negligible accuracy
loss, while consistently maintaining robust performance on complex tasks.

Motivation: 当前AI代理无法在测试时动态学习复杂技能，在新环境中表现不佳，这严重限制了其实际应用价值。

Conclusion: EvoTest证明了通过进化整个代理系统可以在测试时有效学习复杂技能，为解决AI代理的测试时学习挑战提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: A fundamental limitation of current AI agents is their inability to learn
complex skills on the fly at test time, often behaving like "clever but
clueless interns" in novel environments. This severely limits their practical
utility. To systematically measure and drive progress on this challenge, we
first introduce the Jericho Test-Time Learning (J-TTL) benchmark. J-TTL is a
new evaluation setup where an agent must play the same game for several
consecutive episodes, attempting to improve its performance from one episode to
the next. On J-TTL, we find that existing adaptation methods like reflection,
memory, or reinforcement learning struggle. To address the challenges posed by
our benchmark, we present EvoTest, an evolutionary test-time learning framework
that improves an agent without any fine-tuning or gradients-by evolving the
entire agentic system after every episode. EvoTest has two roles: the Actor
Agent, which plays the game, and the Evolver Agent, which analyzes the episode
transcript to propose a revised configuration for the next run. This
configuration rewrites the prompt, updates memory by logging effective
state-action choices, tunes hyperparameters, and learns the tool-use routines.
On our J-TTL benchmark, EvoTest consistently increases performance,
outperforming not only reflection and memory-only baselines but also more
complex online fine-tuning methods. Notably, our method is the only one capable
of winning two games (Detective and Library), while all baselines fail to win
any.

Conclusion: 提出的感知模型能够有效评估学习模型的效用，并为自动驾驶车辆确定合适的感知方案。

Abstract: The driving environment perception has a vital role for autonomous driving
and nowadays has been actively explored for its realization. The research
community and relevant stakeholders necessitate the development of Deep
Learning (DL) models and AI-enabled solutions to enhance autonomous vehicles
(AVs) for smart mobility. There is a need to develop a model that accurately
perceives multiple objects on the road and predicts the driver's perception to
control the car's movements. This article proposes a novel utility-based
analytical model that enables perception systems of AVs to understand the
driving environment. The article consists of modules: acquiring a custom
dataset having distinctive objects, i.e., motorcyclists, rickshaws, etc; a
DL-based model (YOLOv8s) for object detection; and a module to measure the
utility of perception service from the performance values of trained model
instances. The perception model is validated based on the object detection
task, and its process is benchmarked by state-of-the-art deep learning models'
performance metrics from the nuScense dataset. The experimental results show
three best-performing YOLOv8s instances based on mAP@0.5 values, i.e.,
SGD-based (0.832), Adam-based (0.810), and AdamW-based (0.822). However, the
AdamW-based model (i.e., car: 0.921, motorcyclist: 0.899, truck: 0.793, etc.)
still outperforms the SGD-based model (i.e., car: 0.915, motorcyclist: 0.892,
truck: 0.781, etc.) because it has better class-level performance values,
confirmed by the proposed perception model. We validate that the proposed
function is capable of finding the right perception for AVs. The results above
encourage using the proposed perception model to evaluate the utility of
learning models and determine the appropriate perception for AVs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了状态-动作联合攻击(SAJA)框架，通过协同利用状态和动作扰动来攻击多智能体深度强化学习模型，相比单独的状态或动作攻击更有效且隐蔽。


<details>

Motivation: 现有研究只关注状态攻击或动作攻击，没有有效结合两者。单纯随机组合状态和动作扰动无法发挥协同效应，需要开发更有效的联合攻击方法。

Method: SAJA框架包含两个阶段：状态攻击阶段使用多步梯度上升法结合actor和critic网络计算对抗状态；动作攻击阶段基于扰动状态使用critic网络生成最终对抗动作，并添加启发式正则化器增强critic指导效果。

Result: 在Multi-Agent Particle Environment中的评估显示，SAJA在效果和隐蔽性上都优于单独的状态或动作攻击，且现有防御方法无法有效防御其攻击。

Conclusion: SAJA框架成功展示了状态和动作攻击的协同效应，为多智能体深度强化学习的安全性研究提供了新的攻击视角和基准。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) has shown potential for
cooperative and competitive tasks such as autonomous driving and strategic
gaming. However, models trained by MADRL are vulnerable to adversarial
perturbations on states and actions. Therefore, it is essential to investigate
the robustness of MADRL models from an attack perspective. Existing studies
focus on either state-only attacks or action-only attacks, but do not consider
how to effectively joint them. Simply combining state and action perturbations
such as randomly perturbing states and actions does not exploit their potential
synergistic effects. In this paper, we propose the State-Action Joint Attack
(SAJA) framework that has a good synergistic effects. SAJA consists of two
important phases: (1) In the state attack phase, a multi-step gradient ascent
method utilizes both the actor network and the critic network to compute an
adversarial state, and (2) in the action attack phase, based on the perturbed
state, a second gradient ascent uses the critic network to craft the final
adversarial action. Additionally, a heuristic regularizer measuring the
distance between the perturbed actions and the original clean ones is added
into the loss function to enhance the effectiveness of the critic's guidance.

Abstract: Rationalization, a data-centric framework, aims to build self-explanatory
models to explain the prediction outcome by generating a subset of
human-intelligible pieces of the input data. It involves a cooperative game
model where a generator generates the most human-intelligible parts of the
input (i.e., rationales), followed by a predictor that makes predictions based
on these generated rationales. Conventional rationalization methods typically
impose constraints via regularization terms to calibrate or penalize undesired
generation. However, these methods are suffering from a problem called mode
collapse, in which the predictor produces correct predictions yet the generator
consistently outputs rationales with collapsed patterns. Moreover, existing
studies are typically designed separately for specific collapsed patterns,
lacking a unified consideration. In this paper, we systematically revisit
cooperative rationalization from a novel game-theoretic perspective and
identify the fundamental cause of this problem: the generator no longer tends
to explore new strategies to uncover informative rationales, ultimately leading
the system to converge to a suboptimal game equilibrium (correct predictions
v.s collapsed rationales). To solve this problem, we then propose a novel
approach, Game-theoretic Policy Optimization oriented RATionalization (PORAT),
which progressively introduces policy interventions to address the game
equilibrium in the cooperative game process, thereby guiding the model toward a
more optimal solution state. We theoretically analyse the cause of such a
suboptimal equilibrium and prove the feasibility of the proposed method.
Furthermore, we validate our method on nine widely used real-world datasets and
two synthetic settings, where PORAT achieves up to 8.1% performance
improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了大型语言模型在隐式因果链发现任务中的机制性因果推理能力，发现LLMs主要依赖关联模式匹配而非真正的因果推理，但生成的因果链在逻辑上具有连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大型语言模型如何理解因果关系中的中间因果步骤，以及它们是否能够进行机制性因果推理，特别是在气候变化等争议性话题的论证环境中。

Method: 使用诊断性评估框架，让9个LLMs为给定的因果对生成所有可能的中间因果步骤，这些因果对来自气候变化论证研究资源。

Result: LLMs在生成的因果步骤数量和粒度上存在差异，虽然它们对中间因果连接具有自我一致性和信心，但主要基于关联模式匹配而非真正的因果推理。人类评估确认了生成因果链的逻辑连贯性。

Conclusion: 该研究为推进论证环境中隐式机制性因果推理的未来工作奠定了坚实基础，包括基线因果链发现方法、诊断评估见解和带有因果链的基准数据集。

Abstract: How does a cause lead to an effect, and which intermediate causal steps
explain their connection? This work scrutinizes the mechanistic causal
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to answer these
questions through the task of implicit causal chain discovery. In a diagnostic
evaluation framework, we instruct nine LLMs to generate all possible
intermediate causal steps linking given cause-effect pairs in causal chain
structures. These pairs are drawn from recent resources in argumentation
studies featuring polarized discussion on climate change. Our analysis reveals
that LLMs vary in the number and granularity of causal steps they produce.
Although they are generally self-consistent and confident about the
intermediate causal connections in the generated chains, their judgments are
mainly driven by associative pattern matching rather than genuine causal
reasoning. Nonetheless, human evaluations confirmed the logical coherence and
integrity of the generated chains. Our baseline causal chain discovery
approach, insights from our diagnostic evaluation, and benchmark dataset with
causal chains lay a solid foundation for advancing future work in implicit,
mechanistic causal reasoning in argumentation settings.

Motivation: 移动网络运营商需要有效评估网络覆盖并精确识别服务弱信号点，以提升用户体验质量(QoE)。

Method: 在单个天线级别进行覆盖分析后聚合到站点级别，使用OC-SVM算法将决策超平面建模为有效覆盖轮廓，并扩展该方法分析众包服务丢失报告。

Result: 该框架能够准确映射移动网络覆盖，特别是在复杂城市环境中突出显示信号不足的精细区域。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架在移动网络覆盖映射和弱信号点识别方面表现出高效性，为网络优化提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Effective assessment of mobile network coverage and the precise
identification of service weak spots are paramount for network operators
striving to enhance user Quality of Experience (QoE). This paper presents a
novel framework for mobile coverage and weak spot analysis utilising
crowdsourced QoE data. The core of our methodology involves coverage analysis
at the individual cell (antenna) level, subsequently aggregated to the site
level, using empirical geolocation data. A key contribution of this research is
the application of One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) algorithm for
calculating mobile network coverage. This approach models the decision
hyperplane as the effective coverage contour, facilitating robust calculation
of coverage areas for individual cells and entire sites. The same methodology
is extended to analyse crowdsourced service loss reports, thereby identifying
and quantifying geographically localised weak spots. Our findings demonstrate
the efficacy of this novel framework in accurately mapping mobile coverage and,
crucially, in highlighting granular areas of signal deficiency, particularly
within complex urban environments.

*He Du,Bowen Li,Chengxing Xie,Chang Gao,Kai Chen,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了Confidence-as-a-Reward (CRew)方法，利用模型对最终答案的token级置信度作为奖励信号，无需训练即可在数学推理任务中超越现有无训练奖励方法，甚至优于多数训练过的奖励模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型需要大量标注数据和昂贵训练，而无训练方法如LLM-as-a-Judge虽能利用LLM内在推理能力，但使用置信度作为奖励的概念尚未得到系统研究。

Method: 提出CRew方法，使用模型对最终答案的token级置信度作为奖励代理；进一步提出CRew-DPO训练策略，结合置信度得分和正确性信号构建偏好数据进行微调。

Result: 在MATH500和RewardMATH基准测试中，CRew超越现有无训练奖励方法，甚至优于多数训练过的奖励模型；CRew得分与模型实际推理性能强相关；CRew能有效筛选高质量训练数据。

Conclusion: CRew是一种简单而强大的无训练奖励方法，CRew-DPO进一步提升了模型的判断能力，持续优于现有自训练方法。

Abstract: Reward models can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs), but they typically require extensive curated data and
costly training. To mitigate these challenges, training-free approaches such as
LLM-as-a-Judge leverage the intrinsic reasoning abilities of LLMs to evaluate
responses, achieving promising results. Recent works have also indicated that
model confidence can serve effectively as a reward metric, distinguishing
between chain-of-thought (CoT) and non-CoT paths. However, the concept of using
confidence as a reward has not been comprehensively studied. In this work, we
systematically investigate Confidence-as-a-Reward (CRew), a simple yet powerful
training-free method that utilizes token-level confidence in the model's final
answers as a proxy for reward, especially suitable for close-ended tasks.
Through extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks, we demonstrate
that CRew outperforms existing training-free reward approaches on the MATH500
and RewardMATH benchmarks, and even surpasses most trained reward models. We
further identify a strong correlation between CRew scores and the actual
reasoning performance of the model. Additionally, we find that CRew can
effectively filter high-quality training data. Building upon these insights, we
propose CRew-DPO, a training strategy that constructs preference data from
confidence scores combined with correctness signals. Finetuning with CRew-DPO
further enhances the model's judging capabilities and consistently outperforms
existing self-training methods.

account for various unique risks present in choosing specific metrics.
Additionally, many widespread benchmarks created by foundational research labs

explains these challenges and provides a Risk Assessment Framework to allow for
better application of SME and machine learning Metrics

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: As language models continue to rapidly improve, we can expect their actions
and reasoning to become difficult or impossible for weaker agents and humans to
follow, undermining interpretability and oversight. With an eye on long-term
futures, we pursue methods that encourage models to produce solutions that
remain intelligible to weaker collaborators. We formalize intelligibility as
handoff robustness: a strong model's solution is intelligible to a weaker model
if randomly handing off control to the weaker model along the solution path
does not cause failure. Building on this criterion, we introduce tandem
training for language models, a reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm in which
rollout tokens are intermittently and randomly sampled from a frozen weak model
rather than the strong model being trained. Because rollouts succeed only when
the strong model's actions and reasoning process can be continued by the weak
model -- when the two can co-construct a successful solution -- optimizing
standard RL objectives with tandem training implicitly incentivizes both
correctness and intelligibility. In the GSM8K math reasoning task, tandem
training reliably teaches models to abandon jargon and adapt their language to
weaker partners while keeping task accuracy high. Our results demonstrate a
promising route to building AI systems that remain auditable by weaker agents,
with implications for human--AI collaboration and multi-agent communication.

Conclusion: Empower提供了一种仅使用离线数据即可训练有用对齐AI代理的框架，无需额外人工反馈或可验证奖励。

Abstract: Assistive agents should not only take actions on behalf of a human, but also
step out of the way and cede control when there are important decisions to be
made. However, current methods for building assistive agents, whether via
mimicking expert humans or via RL finetuning on an inferred reward, often
encourage agents to complete tasks on their own rather than truly assisting the
human attain their objectives. Additionally, these methods often require costly
explicit human feedback to provide a training signal. We propose a new approach
to tuning assistive language models based on maximizing the human's
empowerment, their ability to effect desired changes in the environment. Our
empowerment-maximizing method, Empower, only requires offline text data,
providing a self-supervised method for fine-tuning language models to better
assist humans. To study the efficacy of our approach, we conducted an 18-person
user study comparing our empowerment assistant with a strong baseline.
Participants preferred our assistant 78% of the time (p=0.015), with a 31%
higher acceptance rate and 38% fewer suggestions. Additionally, we introduce a
new environment for evaluating multi-turn code assistance using simulated
humans. Using this environment, we show that agents trained with Empower
increase the success rate of a simulated human programmer on challenging coding
questions by an average of 192% over an SFT baseline. With this empowerment
objective, we provide a framework for useful aligned AI agents at scale using
only offline data without the need for any additional human feedback or
verifiable rewards.

Conclusion: 控制理论护栏为当前标记-阻止式护栏提供了有原则的动态替代方案，能够可靠地防止下游危害。

Abstract: Generative AI systems are increasingly assisting and acting on behalf of end
users in practical settings, from digital shopping assistants to
next-generation autonomous cars. In this context, safety is no longer about
blocking harmful content, but about preempting downstream hazards like
financial or physical harm. Yet, most AI guardrails continue to rely on output
classification based on labeled datasets and human-specified criteria,making
them brittle to new hazardous situations. Even when unsafe conditions are
flagged, this detection offers no path to recovery: typically, the AI system
simply refuses to act--which is not always a safe choice. In this work, we
argue that agentic AI safety is fundamentally a sequential decision problem:
harmful outcomes arise from the AI system's continually evolving interactions
and their downstream consequences on the world. We formalize this through the
lens of safety-critical control theory, but within the AI model's latent
representation of the world. This enables us to build predictive guardrails
that (i) monitor an AI system's outputs (actions) in real time and (ii)
proactively correct risky outputs to safe ones, all in a model-agnostic manner
so the same guardrail can be wrapped around any AI model. We also offer a
practical training recipe for computing such guardrails at scale via
safety-critical reinforcement learning. Our experiments in simulated driving
and e-commerce settings demonstrate that control-theoretic guardrails can
reliably steer LLM agents clear of catastrophic outcomes (from collisions to
bankruptcy) while preserving task performance, offering a principled dynamic
alternative to today's flag-and-block guardrails.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based reasoning systems have recently achieved
gold medal-level performance in the IMO 2025 competition, writing mathematical
proofs where, to receive full credit, each step must be not only correct but
also sufficiently supported. To train LLM-based reasoners in such challenging,
open-ended settings, strong verifiers capable of catching step-level mistakes
are necessary prerequisites. We introduce Hard2Verify, a human-annotated,
step-level verification benchmark produced with over 500 hours of human labor.
Hard2Verify is designed to rigorously assess step-level verifiers at the
frontier: Verifiers must provide step-level annotations or identify the first
error in responses generated by frontier LLMs for very recent, challenging, and
open-ended math questions. We evaluate 29 generative critics and process reward
models, demonstrating that, beyond a few standouts, open-source verifiers lag
closed source models. We subsequently analyze what drives poor performance in
step-level verification, the impacts of scaling verifier compute, as well as
fundamental questions such as self-verification and verification-generation
dynamics.

Abstract: Control problems frequently arise in scientific and industrial applications,
where the objective is to steer a dynamical system from an initial state to a
desired target state. Recent advances in deep learning and automatic
differentiation have made applying these methods to control problems
increasingly practical. In this paper, we examine the use of neural networks
and modern machine-learning libraries to parameterize control inputs across
discrete-time and continuous-time systems, as well as deterministic and
stochastic dynamics. We highlight applications in multiple domains, including
biology, engineering, physics, and medicine. For continuous-time dynamical
systems, neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) offer a useful
approach to parameterizing control inputs. For discrete-time systems, we show
how custom control-input parameterizations can be implemented and optimized
using automatic-differentiation methods. Overall, the methods presented provide
practical solutions for control tasks that are computationally demanding or
analytically intractable, making them valuable for complex real-world
applications.

Abstract: Limited visibility of power distribution network power flows at the low
voltage level presents challenges to both distribution network operators from a
planning perspective and distribution system operators from a congestion
management perspective. Forestalling these challenges through scenario analysis
is confounded by the lack of realistic and coherent load data across
representative distribution feeders. Load profiling approaches often rely on
summarising demand through typical profiles, which oversimplifies the
complexity of substation-level operations and limits their applicability in
specific power system studies. Sampling methods, and more recently generative
models, have attempted to address this through synthesising representative
loads from historical exemplars; however, while these approaches can
approximate load shapes to a convincing degree of fidelity, the co-behaviour
between substations, which ultimately impacts higher voltage level network
operation, is often overlooked. This limitation will become even more
pronounced with the increasing integration of low-carbon technologies, as
estimates of base loads fail to capture load diversity. To address this gap, a
Conditional Diffusion model for synthesising daily active and reactive power
profiles at the low voltage distribution substation level is proposed. The
evaluation of fidelity is demonstrated through conventional metrics capturing
temporal and statistical realism, as well as power flow modelling. The results
show synthesised load profiles are plausible both independently and as a cohort
in a wider power systems context. The Conditional Diffusion model is
benchmarked against both naive and state-of-the-art models to demonstrate its
effectiveness in producing realistic scenarios on which to base sub-regional
power distribution network planning and operations.

Abstract: In highly nonlinear systems such as the ones commonly found in astrodynamics,
Gaussian distributions generally evolve into non-Gaussian distributions. This
paper introduces a method for effectively controlling non-Gaussian
distributions in nonlinear environments using optimized linear feedback
control. This paper utilizes Conjugate Unscented Transformation to quantify the
higher-order statistical moments of non-Gaussian distributions. The formulation
focuses on controlling and constraining the sigma points associated with the
uncertainty quantification, which would thereby reflect the control of the
entire distribution and constraints on the moments themselves. This paper
develops an algorithm to solve this problem with sequential convex programming,
and it is demonstrated through a two-body and three-body example. The examples
show that individual moments can be directly controlled, and the moments are
accurately approximated for non-Gaussian distributions throughout the
controller's time horizon in nonlinear dynamics.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了四种直接空气捕集（DAC）技术在电力市场中的商业运营，发现DAC可以通过利用电价波动在低价时段运行，实现成本效益的脱碳转型，但盈利驱动决策可能降低DAC的容量因子和总CO2去除量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前脱碳努力未能达到净零温室气体排放目标，需要大规模碳去除方法如DAC，但DAC的巨大能耗带来整合挑战。

Method: 建模四种商业DAC技术，在加州、德州和纽约三个代表性地区分析其在电力批发市场中的运营，考虑电价波动和环境因素影响。

Result: 商业DAC运营可利用电价波动在低价时段战略运行；环境因素对减排能力有显著影响；盈利驱动决策带来气候经济权衡，可能降低DAC容量因子和总CO2去除。

Conclusion: 周期短、灵活性高的DAC技术能更好利用电价波动；电力市场存在持续低价窗口，常与低电网排放期协同；需要优化激励设计，碳税政策对DAC系统适得其反。

Abstract: Current decarbonization efforts are falling short of meeting the net-zero
greenhouse gas (GHG) emission target, highlighting the need for substantial
carbon dioxide removal methods such as direct air capture (DAC). However,
integrating DACs poses challenges due to their enormous power consumption. This
study assesses the commercial operation of various DAC technologies that earn
revenue using monetized carbon incentives while purchasing electricity from
wholesale power markets. We model four commercial DAC technologies and examine
their operation in three representative locations including California, Texas,
and New York. Our findings reveal that commercial DAC operations can take
financial advantage of the volatile power market to operate only during
low-price periods strategically, offering a pathway to facilitate a
cost-efficient decarbonization transition. The ambient operational environment
such as temperature and relative humidity has non-trivial impact on abatement
capacity. Profit-driven decisions introduce climate-economic trade-offs that
might decrease the capacity factor of DAC and reduce total CO2 removal. These
implications extend throughout the entire lifecycle of DAC developments and
influence power systems and policies related to full-scale DAC implementation.
Our study shows that DAC technologies with shorter cycle spans and higher
flexibility can better exploit the electricity price volatility, while power
markets demonstrate persistent low-price windows that often synergize with low
grid emission periods, like during the solar "duck curve" in California. An
optimal incentive design exists for profit-driven operations while carbon-tax
policy in electricity pricing is counterproductive for DAC systems.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 开发了首个120V热泵热水器控制系统，使用模型预测控制实现高效舒适加热，无需电阻加热元件，显著降低安装成本和能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统240V热泵热水器需要安装240V电路，增加约50%以上前期成本；现有120V热水器需保持高温存储以确保舒适性，能耗较高。

Method: 采用模型预测控制(MPC)系统，通过机器学习预测器预测大水量使用，实现预热控制；通过时间转移电力负荷降低能源成本。

Result: 相比240V热泵热水器，在分时电价和小时电价下分别平均节省23%和28%能源成本；相比恒温60°C存储的120V热水器，平均节省37%能耗。

Conclusion: 120V热泵热水器配合MPC控制系统在经济上具有吸引力，在大多数安装场景下具有良好投资回报。

Abstract: Electric heat-pump water heaters (HPWHs) could reduce the energy costs,
emissions, and power grid impacts associated with water heating, the
second-largest energy use in United States housing. However, most HPWHs today
require 240 V circuits to power the backup resistance heating elements they use
to maintain comfort during large water draws. Installing a 240 V circuit can
increase the up-front cost of a HPWH by half or more. This paper develops and
field-tests the first control system that enables a 120 V HPWH to efficiently
maintain comfort without resistance heating elements. The novel model
predictive control (MPC) system enables pre-heating in anticipation of large
water draws, which it forecasts using an ensemble of machine learning
predictors. By shifting electrical load over time, MPC also reduces energy
costs on average by 23% and 28% under time-of-use pricing and hourly pricing,
respectively, relative to a 240 V HPWH with standard controls. Compared to the
increasingly common practice in 120 V HPWHs of storing water at a constant,
high temperature (60 {\deg}C) to ensure comfort, MPC saves 37% energy on
average. In addition to demonstrating MPC's benefits in a real, occupied house,
this paper discusses implementation challenges and costs. A simple payback
analysis suggests that a 120 V HPWH, operated by the MPC system developed here,
would be economically attractive in most installation scenarios.

Motivation: 在竞争性市场中，电动汽车公共充电基础设施规划面临挑战，需要同时考虑多个服务提供商对拥堵和用户行为的影响，现有模型缺乏对竞争对手和实际排队系统的充分考虑。

Method: 1) 分析三种有限排队系统(M/M/1/K, M/M/s/K, M/Er/s/K)；2) 将基于排队的用户行为模型嵌入双层规划，上层优化充电站位置以最大化吞吐量，下层捕获用户均衡选择；3) 应用重构方法和基于代理的启发式算法求解；4) 在蒙特利尔真实案例中验证。

Conclusion: 该方法为充电站规划提供了一个有效工具，能够综合考虑排队服务质量和市场竞争因素，提升充电网络性能。

Abstract: Electric vehicle (EV) public charging infrastructure planning faces
significant challenges in competitive markets, where multiple service providers
affect congestion and user behavior. This work extends existing modeling
frameworks by incorporating the presence of competitors' stations and more
realistic queueing systems.
  First, we analyze three finite queueing systems, M/M/1/K, M/M/s/K, and
M/Er/s/K, with varying numbers of servers (charging outlets) and service time
distributions, deriving analytic expressions for user behavior metrics. Second,
we embed the queueing-based user behavior model into a bilevel program, where
the upper level locates new charging stations to maximize accessibility
(throughput), and the lower level captures users' station choices via a user
equilibrium. Third, we apply a reformulation from competitive congested
user-choice facility location models to approximately solve the bilevel problem
and introduce a surrogate-based heuristic to enhance scalability. Fourth, we
showcase our methodology on a real-world case study of an urban area in
Montreal (Canada), offering managerial insights into how user-choice behavior
assumptions and competition affect throughput and location decisions. The
results demonstrate that our model yields (re)location strategies that
outperform the existing network. More broadly, this approach provides a tool
for incorporating charging service quality-through queueing metrics-and
existing competition into station planning.

Conclusion: 所提出的指标能够有效选择用于母线分裂的母线，无需逐个测试电网中的每个母线。

Abstract: Rising electricity demand and the growing integration of renewables are
intensifying congestion in transmission grids. Grid topology optimization
through busbar splitting (BuS) and optimal transmission switching can alleviate
grid congestion and reduce the generation costs in a power system. However, BuS
optimization requires a large number of binary variables, and analyzing all the
substations for potential new topological actions is computationally
intractable, particularly in large grids. To tackle this issue, we propose a
set of metrics to identify and rank promising candidates for BuS, focusing on
finding buses where topology optimization can reduce generation costs. To
assess the effect of BuS on the identified buses, we use a combined
mixed-integer convex-quadratic BuS model to compute the optimal topology and
test it with the non-linear non-convex AC optimal power flow (OPF) simulation
to show its AC feasibility. By testing and validating the proposed metrics on
test cases of different sizes, we show that they are able to identify busbars
that reduce the total generation costs when their topology is optimized. Thus,
the metrics enable effective selection of busbars for BuS, with no need to test
every busbar in the grid, one at a time.

Motivation: 随着航天工业发展，对燃料效率、成本效益和任务寿命的要求不断提高，需要改进RPOD模型来满足这些需求。

Method: 比较Clohessy-Wiltshire方程与更高精度的RPOD模型，评估自然运动圆周导航与强制运动圆周导航在相似任务参数下的燃料消耗。

Result: 研究表明，无强制运动并不比强制运动更省油，CW模型预测的零燃料轨迹实际上需要GNC脉冲机动来维持。

Conclusion: 自然运动并不比强制运动更省油，这为在更高燃料效率下进行扩展轨道操作提供了可能性。

Abstract: This paper compares the required fuel usage for forced and unforced motion of
a chaser satellite engaged in Rendezvous, Proximity Operations, and Docking
(RPOD) maneuvers. Improved RPOD models are vital, particularly as the space
industry expands and demands for improved fuel efficiency, cost effectiveness,
and mission life span increase. This paper specifically examines the Clohessy-
Wiltshire (CW) Equations and the extent of model mismatch by comparing pre-
dicted trajectories from this model with a more computationally complex, higher
fidelity RPOD model. This paper assesses several test cases of similar mission
parameters, in each case comparing natural motion circumnavigation (NMC) with
comparable forced motion circumnavigation. The Guidance, Navigation, and Con-
trol (GNC) impulse maneuvers required to maintain the supposedly zero fuel CW
trajectories is representative of the extent of CW model mismatch. This paper
demonstrates that unforced motions are not inherently more fuel efficient than
forced motions, thus permitting extended orbital operations given the higher
fuel efficiency.

Abstract: Cloud-assisted system identification and control have emerged as practical
solutions for low-power, resource-constrained control systems such as
micro-UAVs. In a typical cloud-assisted setting, state and input data are
transmitted from local agents to a central computer over low-bandwidth wireless
links, leading to quantization. This paper investigates the impact of state and
input data quantization on a linear time invariant (LTI) system identification,
derives a worst-case bound on the identification error, and develops a robust
controller for guaranteed cost control. We establish a fundamental bound on the
model error that depends only on the quantized data and quantization
resolution, and develop a linear matrix inequality (LMI) based guaranteed cost
robust controller under this error bound.

Motivation: 工业场所依赖柴油动力轻型卡车导致大量温室气体排放，需要电气化解决方案来减少排放。

Conclusion: 该模型为工业场所卡车电气化提供了有效的充电基础设施规划方法，能够处理实际运营中的不确定性和调度约束。

Abstract: Many industrial sites rely on diesel-powered light-duty trucks to transport
workers and small-scale facilities, which has resulted in a significant amount
of greenhouse emissions (GHGs). To address this, we developed a two-stage
robust charging infrastructure planning model for electrifying light-duty
trucks at industrial sites. The model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear
programming (MILP) that optimizes the charging infrastructure, selected from
multiple charger types and potential locations, and determines opportunity
charging schedules for each truck based on the chosen infrastructure. Given the
strict stopping points and schedules at industrial sites, we introduced a
scheduling problem with abandonment, where trucks forgo charging if their
waiting times exceed a maximum threshold. We also further incorporated the
impacts of overnight charging and range anxiety on waiting and abandonment
behaviors. To represent the stochastic and heterogeneous parking durations of
trucks, we constructed a decision-dependent robust uncertainty set in which
parking time variability flexibly depends on charging choices. We applied the
model in a case study of an open-pit mining site, which plans charger
installations in eight zones and schedules a fleet of around 200 trucks. By
decomposing the problem into monthly subproblems and using heuristic
approaches, for the whole-year dataset, the model achieves an optimality gap of
less than 0.1 % within a reasonable computation time under diverse uncertainty
scenarios.

Conclusion: 提出的概率安全证书方法能够有效处理自动驾驶遮挡环境中的潜在风险，提供实时安全控制，平衡安全性和保守性。

Abstract: Ensuring safe autonomous driving in the presence of occlusions poses a
significant challenge in its policy design. While existing model-driven control
techniques based on set invariance can handle visible risks, occlusions create
latent risks in which safety-critical states are not observable. Data-driven
techniques also struggle to handle latent risks because direct mappings from
risk-critical objects in sensor inputs to safe actions cannot be learned
without visible risk-critical objects. Motivated by these challenges, in this
paper, we propose a probabilistic safety certificate for latent risk. Our key
technical enabler is the application of probabilistic invariance: It relaxes
the strict observability requirements imposed by set-invariance methods that
demand the knowledge of risk-critical states. The proposed techniques provide
linear action constraints that confine the latent risk probability within
tolerance. Such constraints can be integrated into model predictive controllers
or embedded in data-driven policies to mitigate latent risks. The proposed
method is tested using the CARLA simulator and compared with a few existing
techniques. The theoretical and empirical analysis jointly demonstrate that the
proposed methods assure long-term safety in real-time control in occluded
environments without being overly conservative and with transparency to exposed
risks.

<details>

Motivation: 自动驾驶系统需要实时保证，通常建模为DAG。其加速特性导致执行时间通常低于最坏情况，因此概率方法比最坏情况保证更适合这些系统。

Method: 利用单处理器概率保证的研究成果，提出任务集分区方法，在分区调度下保证可调度性，并比较了四种装箱启发式算法。

Result: 评估显示，所提方法比现有DAG概率可调度性分析调度更多任务集，且平均分析时间更短。Item-Centric Worst-Fit-Decreasing启发式调度最多任务集。

Conclusion: 提出的概率保证方法适用于DAG任务系统，在分区调度下能有效保证可调度性，且性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems, critical for safety, require real-time guarantees
and can be modeled as DAGs. Their acceleration features, such as caches and
pipelining, often result in execution times below the worst-case. Thus, a
probabilistic approach ensuring constraint satisfaction within a probability
threshold is more suitable than worst-case guarantees for these systems. This
paper considers probabilistic guarantees for DAG tasks by utilizing the results
of probabilistic guarantees for single processors, which have been relatively
more advanced than those for multi-core processors. This paper proposes a task
set partitioning method that guarantees schedulability under the partitioned
scheduling. The evaluation on randomly generated DAG task sets demonstrates
that the proposed method schedules more task sets with a smaller mean analysis
time compared to existing probabilistic schedulability analysis for DAGs. The
evaluation also compares four bin-packing heuristics, revealing Item-Centric
Worst-Fit-Decreasing schedules the most task sets.

Abstract: The growing integration of distributed renewable generation and the
electrification of heating and transportation are rapidly increasing the number
of flexible devices within modern distribution grids. Leveraging the aggregated
flexibility of these small-scale distributed resources is essential to
maintaining future grid-wide stability. This work uses the Swiss distribution
grid of Walenstadt as a case study to provide insights into the aggregated
flexibility potential of distribution grids. It demonstrates that incorporating
devices such as heat pumps and photovoltaic systems significantly enhances
distribution grid flexibility. It investigates the time-varying nature of
aggregated flexibility and highlights how it can vary seasonally. Furthermore,
simulations of future scenarios reveal that aggregated flexibility does not
increase linearly or monotonically with higher levels of flexible device
penetration. This is primarily due to the overloading of individual feeders,
which underscores the impact of grid topology and network constraints on the
aggregated flexibility potential.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of vehicle collision dynamics is crucial for advanced
safety systems and post-impact control applications, yet existing methods face
inherent trade-offs among computational efficiency, prediction accuracy, and
data requirements. This paper proposes a dual Physics-Informed Neural Network
framework addressing these challenges through two complementary networks. The
first network integrates Gaussian Mixture Models with PINN architecture to
learn impact force distributions from finite element analysis data while
enforcing momentum conservation and energy consistency constraints. The second
network employs an adaptive PINN with dynamic constraint weighting to predict
post-collision vehicle dynamics, featuring an adaptive physics guard layer that
prevents unrealistic predictions whil e preserving data-driven learning
capabilities. The framework incorporates uncertainty quantification through
time-varying parameters and enables rapid adaptation via fine-tuning
strategies. Validation demonstrates significant improvements: the impact force
model achieves relative errors below 15.0% for force prediction on finite
element analysis (FEA) datasets, while the vehicle dynamics model reduces
average trajectory prediction error by 63.6% compared to traditional
four-degree-of-freedom models in scaled vehicle experiments. The integrated
system maintains millisecond-level computational efficiency suitable for
real-time applications while providing probabilistic confidence bounds
essential for safety-critical control. Comprehensive validation through FEA
simulation, dynamic modeling, and scaled vehicle experiments confirms the
framework's effectiveness for Precision Immobilization Technique scenarios and
general collision dynamics prediction.

Abstract: The transition to a fully decarbonised electricity system depends on
integrating new technologies that ensure reliability alongside sustainability.
However, missing risk markets hinder investment in reliability-enhancing
technologies by exposing investors to revenue uncertainty. This study provides
the first quantitative assessment of how missing risk markets affect investment
decisions in power systems that depend on long-duration energy storage (LDES)
for reliability. We develop a two-stage stochastic equilibrium model with
risk-averse market participants, which independently sizes power and energy
capacity. We apply the method to a case study of a deeply decarbonised power
system in Great Britain. The results show that incomplete risk markets reduce
social welfare, harm reliability, and discourage investment in LDES and other
technologies with volatile revenue streams. Revenue volatility leads to
substantial risk premiums and higher financing costs for LDES, creating a
barrier to its large-scale deployment. These findings demonstrate the
importance of policy mechanisms that hedge revenue risk to lower the cost of
capital and accelerate investment in reliability-enhancing, zero-carbon
technologies

Abstract: This paper investigates a multiple antenna system with non-orthogonal
multiple access (NOMA) for the exchange of air traffic management data between
commercial aircraft pilots and ground-based air traffic controllers. While NOMA
techniques enhance spectral efficiency, their application to aircraft
communications is challenged by the high speed of the aircraft (up to 214 m/s)
and the long communication ranges (up to 250 km), resulting in significant
Doppler shifts and low signal-to-noise ratios, respectively. To accurately
assess these challenges, we employ a realistic geometry-based stochastic
air-ground channel model, derived from dedicated flight measurement campaigns.
In this paper, multiple aircraft simultaneously transmit data to the ground
station. We focus on the channel estimation problem at the ground station under
high carrier frequency offsets and the effects of channel aging due to
channel's time-varying nature. For the channel estimation problem, we compare
the Zadoff-Chu sequences with time-division approach under varying carrier
frequency offset pre-compensation accuracies at the aircraft transmitter. For
the channel aging problem and performance evaluation of channel estimators, we
compute the outage probability for both the zero-forcing detector and the
minimum mean squared error detector with successive interference cancellation.
The results show that the favorable channel estimator-detector combinations
differ between the takeoff & landing phase and the enroute cruise phase of the
flight, due to the distinct channel propagation characteristics of each phase.

TL;DR: 语义知识为累积创新提供认知支架，通过与社交学习协同作用增强创新能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解累积文化进化中产生创新的认知过程，特别是语义知识在创新中的作用

Method: 使用基于代理的文化进化模型和大规模行为实验（N=1,243），测试语义知识如何指导探索并促进创新

Result: 语义知识和社交学习协同增强创新；无语义知识的参与者表现不优于随机水平，依赖浅层探索策略

Conclusion: 语义知识是实现人类累积文化的关键认知过程

Abstract: Cumulative cultural evolution enables human societies to generate
increasingly complex knowledge and technology over generations. While social
learning transmits innovations between individuals and generations, the
cognitive processes that generate these innovations remain poorly understood.
Here, we demonstrate that semantic knowledge-structured associations between
concepts and their functions-provides cognitive scaffolding for cumulative
innovation by guiding exploration toward plausible and meaningful actions. We
tested this hypothesis using a cultural evolutionary agent-based model and a
large-scale behavioural experiment (N = 1,243), in which individuals performed
a task requiring the combination of items into novel innovations. Across both
approaches, semantic knowledge and social learning interact synergistically to
enhance innovation. Behaviorally, participants without access to semantic
knowledge performed no better than chance, even when social learning was
available, and relied on shallow exploration strategies. These findings suggest
that semantic knowledge is a key cognitive process enabling human cumulative
culture.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: KVCOMM是一个无需训练的框架，通过重用KV缓存并在不同前缀上下文下对齐缓存偏移，解决多智能体LLM系统中重复处理重叠上下文导致的效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体LLM系统在处理复杂语言任务时，由于智能体间通信需要重复处理重叠上下文，导致严重的计算开销。虽然KV缓存在单智能体场景中有效，但在多智能体场景中由于前缀差异无法直接重用。

Method: 提出KVCOMM框架，通过参考存储不同前缀下缓存偏差的锚点池，估计和调整共享内容的KV缓存。锚点池在线维护和更新，适应不同的用户请求和上下文结构。

Result: 在多样化多智能体工作负载中实现超过70%的重用率，包括检索增强生成、数学推理和协作编码任务，且无质量下降。在五智能体设置下，相比标准预填充流程实现7.8倍加速，TTFT从~430ms降至~55ms。

Conclusion: KVCOMM有效解决了多智能体LLM系统中的计算冗余问题，显著提升推理效率，为多智能体系统的大规模部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-agent large language model (LLM) systems are increasingly adopted for
complex language processing tasks that require communication and coordination
among agents. However, these systems often suffer substantial overhead from
repeated reprocessing of overlapping contexts across agents. In typical
pipelines, once an agent receives a message from its predecessor, the full
context-including prior turns-must be reprocessed from scratch, leading to
inefficient processing. While key-value (KV) caching is an effective solution
for avoiding redundant computation in single-agent settings where prefixes
remain unchanged, it cannot be directly reused in multi-agent scenarios due to
diverging prefixes introduced by agent-specific context extensions. We identify
that the core challenge lies in the offset variance of KV-caches across agents.
To address this, we propose KVCOMM, a training-free framework that enables
efficient prefilling in multi-agent inference by reusing KV-caches and aligning
cache offsets of overlapping contexts under diverse prefix contexts. KVCOMM
estimates and adjusts KV-caches for shared content by referencing a pool of
cached examples-termed anchors-that store observed cache deviations under
varying prefixes. The anchor pool is maintained and updated online, allowing
dynamic adaptation to distinct user requests and context structures. KVCOMM
achieves over 70% reuse rate across diverse multi-agent workloads, including
retrieval-augmented generation, math reasoning, and collaborative coding tasks,
all without quality degradation. Particularly, when each fully-connected agent
receives 1K input tokens with 512 prefix tokens and 512 output tokens under a
five-agent setting, KVCOMM achieves up to 7.8x speedup compared to the standard
prefill pipeline, reducing TTFT from ~430 ms to ~55 ms.

Motivation: 传统拼车平台以利润为导向，忽视公平性和可持续性，导致城市交通拥堵和燃料消耗问题持续存在。

Method: 使用多智能体强化学习（MADDPG）进行动态拼车匹配，结合博弈论均衡保证公平性，并采用人口模型维持长期平衡。

Result: 基于纽约出租车数据的实验表明，ARS能减少出行距离和排放，提高车辆利用率，促进公平参与。

Conclusion: ARS是一种可扩展的社区驱动替代方案，能将个体行为与城市可持续目标对齐。

Abstract: Urban mobility faces persistent challenges of congestion and fuel
consumption, specifically when people choose a private, point-to-point commute
option. Profit-driven ride-sharing platforms prioritize revenue over fairness
and sustainability. This paper introduces Altruistic Ride-Sharing (ARS), a
decentralized, peer-to-peer mobility framework where participants alternate
between driver and rider roles based on altruism points rather than monetary
incentives. The system integrates multi-agent reinforcement learning (MADDPG)
for dynamic ride-matching, game-theoretic equilibrium guarantees for fairness,
and a population model to sustain long-term balance. Using real-world New York
City taxi data, we demonstrate that ARS reduces travel distance and emissions,
increases vehicle utilization, and promotes equitable participation compared to
both no-sharing and optimization-based baselines. These results establish ARS
as a scalable, community-driven alternative to conventional ride-sharing,
aligning individual behavior with collective urban sustainability goals.

Motivation: 现有的MARL模型虽然能提升性能，但没有显式考虑智能体决策顺序的重要性

Result: 在StarCraft多智能体挑战和Multi-Agent MuJoCo基准测试中，AOAD-MAT模型优于现有的MAT和其他基线模型

Conclusion: 调整智能体动作决策顺序在MARL中是有效的，AOAD-MAT模型通过考虑决策顺序显著提升了性能

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning focuses on training the behaviors of
multiple learning agents that coexist in a shared environment. Recently, MARL
models, such as the Multi-Agent Transformer (MAT) and ACtion dEpendent deep
Q-learning (ACE), have significantly improved performance by leveraging
sequential decision-making processes. Although these models can enhance
performance, they do not explicitly consider the importance of the order in
which agents make decisions. In this paper, we propose an Agent Order of Action
Decisions-MAT (AOAD-MAT), a novel MAT model that considers the order in which
agents make decisions. The proposed model explicitly incorporates the sequence
of action decisions into the learning process, allowing the model to learn and
predict the optimal order of agent actions. The AOAD-MAT model leverages a
Transformer-based actor-critic architecture that dynamically adjusts the
sequence of agent actions. To achieve this, we introduce a novel MARL
architecture that cooperates with a subtask focused on predicting the next
agent to act, integrated into a Proximal Policy Optimization based loss
function to synergistically maximize the advantage of the sequential
decision-making. The proposed method was validated through extensive
experiments on the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge and Multi-Agent MuJoCo
benchmarks. The experimental results show that the proposed AOAD-MAT model
outperforms existing MAT and other baseline models, demonstrating the
effectiveness of adjusting the AOAD order in MARL.

Motivation: 传统基于离散分类的宠物情感识别方法难以处理模糊性和捕捉情感强度变化，需要更精确的连续情感表示方法。

Method: 使用自动VA标签生成算法标注42,553个宠物发声样本，采用多任务学习框架联合训练VA回归与辅助任务（情感、体型、性别），使用音频Transformer模型。

Result: 验证集上价维度Pearson相关系数r=0.9024，唤醒维度r=0.7155，有效解决了'领地行为'和'快乐'等离散类别间的混淆问题。

Conclusion: 该连续VA框架为人类-宠物互动、兽医诊断和行为训练提供了更具表现力的情感表示，在AI宠物情感翻译器等消费产品中具有强大部署潜力。

Abstract: Traditional pet emotion recognition from vocalizations, based on discrete
classification, struggles with ambiguity and capturing intensity variations. We
propose a continuous Valence-Arousal (VA) model that represents emotions in a
two-dimensional space. Our method uses an automatic VA label generation
algorithm, enabling large-scale annotation of 42,553 pet vocalization samples.
A multi-task learning framework jointly trains VA regression with auxiliary
tasks (emotion, body size, gender) to enhance prediction by improving feature
learning. Our Audio Transformer model achieves a validation Valence Pearson
correlation of r = 0.9024 and an Arousal r = 0.7155, effectively resolving
confusion between discrete categories like "territorial" and "happy." This work
introduces the first continuous VA framework for pet vocalization analysis,
offering a more expressive representation for human-pet interaction, veterinary
diagnostics, and behavioral training. The approach shows strong potential for
deployment in consumer products like AI pet emotion translators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过3D打印技术制造经济实惠的原声吉他，减少对濒危音木的依赖，促进可持续乐器生产，并为弱势群体提供更多接触音乐的机会。

Method: 使用Prusa Mark 4 3D打印机和PLA材料打印古典吉他，因打印平台尺寸限制将琴体分为多个部分，采用压配合公差和少量氰基丙烯酸酯粘合剂连接。使用Fusion 360进行CAD建模确保尺寸精度，组装后用尼龙弦调音，通过Audacity软件测试频率和音准。

Result: 测试结果显示低音弦频率存在较大偏差，这可能是由打印材料选择引起的。尽管存在频率差异，但通过调音所有弦都能达到准确音高，证明PLA和现代制造方法可以生产出经济实惠、可演奏的原声吉他。

Conclusion: 3D打印方法在扩大优质乐器获取途径方面具有重要潜力，同时减少对濒危音木的依赖，促进可持续乐器生产和音乐参与。未来研究可探索替代塑料材料以获得更好的频率匹配。

Abstract: This research investigates the feasibility of producing affordable,
functional acoustic guitars using 3D printing, with a focus on producing
structural designs with proper tonal performance. Conducted in collaboration
with William Schiesser, the study uses a classical guitar model, chosen for its
lower string tension, to evaluate the tonal characteristics of a 3D-printed
prototype made from polylactic acid (PLA). Due to the build plate size
constraints of the Prusa Mark 4 printer, the guitar body was divided into
multiple sections joined with press-fit tolerances and minimal cyanoacrylate
adhesive. CAD modeling in Fusion 360 ensured dimensional accuracy in press-fit
connections and the overall assembly. Following assembly, the guitar was strung
with nylon strings and tested using Audacity software to compare recorded
frequencies and notes with standard reference values. Results showed large
deviations in lower string frequencies, likely caused by the material choice
utilized in printing. Accurate pitches were reached with all strings despite
frequency differences through tuning, demonstrating that PLA and modern
manufacturing methods can produce affordable, playable acoustic guitars despite
inevitable challenges. Further research may investigate alternative plastics
for superior frequency matching. This approach holds significant potential for
expanding access to quality instruments while reducing reliance on endangered
tonewoods, thereby encouraging both sustainable instrument production and
increased musical participation. This also creates opportunities for
disadvantaged communities where access to musical instruments remains a
challenge.

Abstract: Human communication is multimodal, with speech and gestures tightly coupled,
yet most computational methods for generating speech and gestures synthesize
them sequentially, weakening synchrony and prosody alignment. We introduce
Gelina, a unified framework that jointly synthesizes speech and co-speech
gestures from text using interleaved token sequences in a discrete
autoregressive backbone, with modality-specific decoders. Gelina supports
multi-speaker and multi-style cloning and enables gesture-only synthesis from

Method: 提出自适应向量转向(AVS)方法，通过探测模型内部状态来更好地将生成内容基于音频内容，利用输出正确性与内部表示之间的强相关性。

Result: 在两个模型和两个基准测试上均获得一致性能提升：在音频幻觉QA数据集上，Gemma的F1分数从0.550提升到0.619，Qwen从0.626提升到0.632；在MMAU上，Qwen的准确率从0.548提升到0.592，相对提升8%。

Conclusion: 这是首个将向量转向应用于缓解音频幻觉的工作，证明了该方法在减少模型幻觉方面的有效性。

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models and Multi-Modal Large Language Models have
demonstrated strong capabilities in tasks such as Audio Question Answering
(AQA), Audio Captioning, and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). However, there
is growing evidence that these models can hallucinate about the content of the
audio. To address this issue, we probe the models' internal states and propose
Adaptive Vector Steering (AVS), a method that better grounds generation in
audio content. We also identify a strong correlation between output correctness
and internal representations. Experiments show consistent performance gains
across two models and two benchmarks. On the Audio Hallucination QA dataset,
our method boosts the F1-score of Gemma from 0.550 to 0.619 and Qwen from 0.626
to 0.632. Furthermore, our method increases the accuracy of Qwen on MMAU from
0.548 to 0.592, marking an 8% relative increase. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first work to apply vector steering to mitigate hallucination in

Motivation: 现有的非并行语音转换方法如CycleGAN和VAE存在训练困难和结果不理想的问题，而基于对比学习的CVC方法虽然有所改进，但其CNN生成器无法捕捉长距离依赖关系，限制了全局语义的建模能力。

Method: 提出VCTR方法，采用混合感知块(HPB)和双剪枝自注意力(DPSA)机制，结合对比学习的对抗训练方法，以更好地捕捉局部和全局语义信息。

Result: 该方法在非并行语音转换任务中表现出色，代码已在GitHub上开源。

Conclusion: VCTR通过引入HPB和DPSA机制，有效解决了传统方法在捕捉长距离依赖关系方面的局限性，为非并行语音转换提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Non-parallel voice conversion aims to convert voice from a source domain to a
target domain without paired training data. Cycle-Consistent Generative
Adversarial Networks (CycleGAN) and Variational Autoencoders (VAE) have been
used for this task, but these models suffer from difficult training and
unsatisfactory results. Later, Contrastive Voice Conversion (CVC) was
introduced, utilizing a contrastive learning-based approach to address these
issues. However, these methods use CNN-based generators, which can capture
local semantics but lacks the ability to capture long-range dependencies
necessary for global semantics. In this paper, we propose VCTR, an efficient
method for non-parallel voice conversion that leverages the Hybrid Perception
Block (HPB) and Dual Pruned Self-Attention (DPSA) along with a contrastive
learning-based adversarial approach. The code can be found in

Method: 提出Embodied Contrastive Loss（ECL）和Structural Rhythm Alignment Loss（SRAL）两个新目标，引入bar-equivariant相位旋转和接触引导注意力机制。

Result: MotionBeat在音乐到舞蹈生成任务中优于最先进的音频编码器，并能有效迁移到节拍跟踪、音乐标记、流派和乐器分类、情感识别以及音频-视觉检索等任务。

Conclusion: MotionBeat通过运动对齐的音乐表示学习，成功捕捉了音乐的节奏和结构特征，在多个下游任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Music is both an auditory and an embodied phenomenon, closely linked to human
motion and naturally expressed through dance. However, most existing audio
representations neglect this embodied dimension, limiting their ability to
capture rhythmic and structural cues that drive movement. We propose
MotionBeat, a framework for motion-aligned music representation learning.
MotionBeat is trained with two newly proposed objectives: the Embodied
Contrastive Loss (ECL), an enhanced InfoNCE formulation with tempo-aware and
beat-jitter negatives to achieve fine-grained rhythmic discrimination, and the
Structural Rhythm Alignment Loss (SRAL), which ensures rhythm consistency by
aligning music accents with corresponding motion events. Architecturally,
MotionBeat introduces bar-equivariant phase rotations to capture cyclic
rhythmic patterns and contact-guided attention to emphasize motion events
synchronized with musical accents. Experiments show that MotionBeat outperforms
state-of-the-art audio encoders in music-to-dance generation and transfers
effectively to beat tracking, music tagging, genre and instrument
classification, emotion recognition, and audio-visual retrieval. Our project

Motivation: 当前多模态模型在音频领域面临挑战，语音和音乐通常独立开发，存在任务冲突和数据不平衡问题，阻碍了通用音频合成的发展。

Method: 提出UniMoE-Audio模型，采用动态容量MoE框架，包含Top-P路由策略和混合专家设计（路由专家、共享专家、空专家），并通过三阶段训练课程：独立专家训练、MoE集成预热、协同联合训练。

Result: 在主要语音和音乐生成基准测试中达到最先进性能，展示了优越的协同学习能力，缓解了传统联合训练中的性能下降问题。

Conclusion: 专业化MoE架构和精心设计的训练策略在推进通用音频生成领域具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in unified multimodal models indicate a clear trend towards
comprehensive content generation. However, the auditory domain remains a
significant challenge, with music and speech often developed in isolation,
hindering progress towards universal audio synthesis. This separation stems
from inherent task conflicts and severe data imbalances, which impede the
development of a truly unified audio generation model. To address this
challenge, we propose UniMoE-Audio, a unified speech and music generation model
within a novel Dynamic-Capacity Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework.
Architecturally, UniMoE-Audio introduces a Top-P routing strategy for dynamic
expert number allocation, and a hybrid expert design comprising routed experts
for domain-specific knowledge, shared experts for domain-agnostic features, and
null experts for adaptive computation skipping. To tackle data imbalance, we
introduce a three-stage training curriculum: 1) Independent Specialist Training
leverages original datasets to instill domain-specific knowledge into each
"proto-expert" without interference; 2) MoE Integration and Warmup incorporates
these specialists into the UniMoE-Audio architecture, warming up the gate
module and shared expert using a subset of balanced dataset; and 3) Synergistic
Joint Training trains the entire model end-to-end on the fully balanced
dataset, fostering enhanced cross-domain synergy. Extensive experiments show
that UniMoE-Audio not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on major
speech and music generation benchmarks, but also demonstrates superior
synergistic learning, mitigating the performance degradation typically seen in
naive joint training. Our findings highlight the substantial potential of
specialized MoE architecture and curated training strategies in advancing the
field of universal audio generation. Homepage:

Motivation: 现有的音频编码器和LLM对齐方法需要昂贵的全模型微调或依赖可能缺乏表达能力的静态适配器，需要一种更高效、模块化的解决方案。

Method: 冻结音频编码器和LLM解码器，在编码器层中集成轻量级steering模块，使用MoE路由器动态选择和应用steering向量，在连续嵌入空间中进行转换。

Result: 在ASR、音频理解和定性函数调用任务上的实验表明，SteerMoE实现了强大的性能，同时保持高度模块化和计算效率。

Conclusion: SteerMoE为开发复杂的音频-语言系统提供了一个稳健的新范式，无需修改LLM词汇表并保留其高级推理和代理能力。

Abstract: Aligning pretrained audio encoders and Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a
promising, parameter-efficient path to building powerful multimodal agents.
However, existing methods often require costly full-model finetuning or rely on
static adapters that may lack expressive power. Drawing inspiration from the
Platonic Representation Hypothesis, we introduce SteerMoE, a novel and modular
framework for audio-language alignment. SteerMoE freezes both the audio encoder
and the LLM decoder, training only a lightweight steering module integrated
within the encoder's layers. This module uses a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) router
to dynamically select and apply learned steering vectors, progressively
transforming continuous audio representations into a space comprehensible to
the LLM. By operating entirely in the continuous embedding space, our approach
requires no modifications to the LLM's vocabulary and preserves its advanced
reasoning and agentic capabilities. We demonstrate through experiments on ASR,
audio understanding, and a qualitative function-calling task that SteerMoE
achieves strong performance while remaining highly modular and computationally
efficient, offering a robust new paradigm for developing sophisticated
audio-language systems.

Abstract: This study presents an inter-universal mathematical-logical framework
constructed upon the minimal axiom Cogito, ergo sum (CES), integrating the
Intermediate Meta-Universe (IMU) and the Hierarchical State Grid (HSG). The CES
defines existence as a reflexive correspondence --'to be' and 'to be
sayable'--and positions any formal system, including ZFC or HoTT, as an
attachable extension atop this minimal structure. The IMU functions as a
registry of axiomatic dependencies that connect heterogeneous theories,
employing the Institution-theoretic framework to ensure coherent
inter-theoretical linkages. The HSG concretizes these ideas through categorical
construction, defined by three orthogonal axes: the state-depth axis, the
mapping-hierarchy axis, and the temporal axis incorporating the principle of
'no future reference.' Through these, the identity of 'definition = state' is
formally established as a categorical property. Extending this structure to
biological systems, the neural system is implemented as a 0-3D complex of
neuron-function fields on the HSG, while its categorical extensions via
fiberization over the material base enable the parallel integration of multiple
physiological universes-neural, endocrine, learning, genetic, and input/output
systems-into a coherent adjoint ensemble. Within this framework, human behavior
and cognition emerge as temporal compositions of inter-universal algorithms
constrained by the material base. Finally, by contrasting human cognition,
which relies on external CES, with machine existence, this study introduces the
concept of internal CES, wherein a machine grounds its own logic upon the
factuality of its operation. This internal self-axiomatization establishes a
continuous bridge between philosophical ontology and engineering
implementation, providing a new foundation for the autonomous and self-defining
existence of artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks are attracting increased attention as a more
energy-efficient alternative to traditional Artificial Neural Networks for edge
computing. Neuromorphic computing can significantly reduce energy requirements.
Here, we present a complete pipeline: efficient event-based training of SNNs
with synaptic delays on GPUs and deployment on Intel's Loihi 2 neuromorphic
chip. We evaluate our approach on keyword recognition tasks using the Spiking
Heidelberg Digits and Spiking Speech Commands datasets, demonstrating that our
algorithm can enhance classification accuracy compared to architectures without
delays. Our benchmarking indicates almost no accuracy loss between GPU and
Loihi 2 implementations, while classification on Loihi 2 is up to 18x faster
and uses 250x less energy than on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano.
