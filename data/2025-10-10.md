### [1] [Enhancing Maritime Object Detection in Real-Time with RT-DETR and Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07346)
*Nader Nemati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于RT-DETR的实时海上目标检测系统，通过合成图像增强和多尺度特征融合等技术，解决了小目标检测和真实数据不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海上目标检测面临小目标尺寸和真实RGB标注数据有限的挑战，需要开发能够实时运行且鲁棒性强的检测系统。

Method: 采用RT-DETR架构，结合多尺度特征融合、不确定性最小化查询选择和合成/真实数据权重平衡策略，使用数据增强技术平衡数据集类别。

Result: 开发了完整的Python鲁棒海上检测流水线，保持实时性能，验证了各模块贡献及系统在极端光照和海况下的处理能力。

Conclusion: 该系统在保持DETR端到端集合预测优势的同时，允许用户在推理时调整速度与精度平衡，有效提升了海上目标检测性能。

Abstract: Maritime object detection faces essential challenges due to the small target
size and limitations of labeled real RGB data. This paper will present a
real-time object detection system based on RT-DETR, enhanced by employing
augmented synthetic images while strictly evaluating on real data. This study
employs RT-DETR for the maritime environment by combining multi-scale feature
fusion, uncertainty-minimizing query selection, and smart weight between
synthetic and real training samples. The fusion module in DETR enhances the
detection of small, low-contrast vessels, query selection focuses on the most
reliable proposals, and the weighting strategy helps reduce the visual gap
between synthetic and real domains. This design preserves DETR's refined
end-to-end set prediction while allowing users to adjust between speed and
accuracy at inference time. Data augmentation techniques were also used to
balance the different classes of the dataset to improve the robustness and
accuracy of the model. Regarding this study, a full Python robust maritime
detection pipeline is delivered that maintains real-time performance even under
practical limits. It also verifies how each module contributes, and how the
system handles failures in extreme lighting or sea conditions. This study also
includes a component analysis to quantify the contribution of each
architectural module and explore its interactions.

### [2] [DynamicEval: Rethinking Evaluation for Dynamic Text-to-Video Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07441)
*Nithin C. Babu,Aniruddha Mahapatra,Harsh Rangwani,Rajiv Soundararajan,Kuldeep Kulkarni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了DynamicEval基准，专注于动态相机运动的文本到视频评估，包含4.5万个人工标注和新的背景一致性、前景一致性指标，在视频级和模型级评估中比现有方法提升2%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2V评估基准存在两个局限：忽视动态相机运动的重要性，以及过度依赖模型级评分而忽略视频级评估。需要专门针对动态相机运动的评估基准。

Method: 构建包含动态相机运动提示的基准，收集4.5万个人工标注。提出新的背景一致性指标（基于物体错误图修正遮挡问题）和前景一致性指标（通过跟踪物体实例内的点来评估物体保真度）。

Result: 新指标在视频级和模型级评估中与人类偏好相关性更强，相比现有方法提升超过2个百分点。背景一致性指标能有效处理相机和前景物体运动导致的遮挡问题。

Conclusion: DynamicEval为动态相机运动下的T2V模型评估提供了更全面的基准，新提出的指标在评估准确性和与人类判断一致性方面表现优异。

Abstract: Existing text-to-video (T2V) evaluation benchmarks, such as VBench and
EvalCrafter, suffer from two limitations. (i) While the emphasis is on
subject-centric prompts or static camera scenes, camera motion essential for
producing cinematic shots and existing metrics under dynamic motion are largely
unexplored. (ii) These benchmarks typically aggregate video-level scores into a
single model-level score for ranking generative models. Such aggregation,
however, overlook video-level evaluation, which is vital to selecting the
better video among the candidate videos generated for a given prompt. To
address these gaps, we introduce DynamicEval, a benchmark consisting of
systematically curated prompts emphasizing dynamic camera motion, paired with
45k human annotations on video pairs from 3k videos generated by ten T2V
models. DynamicEval evaluates two key dimensions of video quality: background
scene consistency and foreground object consistency. For background scene
consistency, we obtain the interpretable error maps based on the Vbench motion
smoothness metric. We observe that while the Vbench motion smoothness metric
shows promising alignment with human judgments, it fails in two cases:
occlusions/disocclusions arising from camera and foreground object movements.
Building on this, we propose a new background consistency metric that leverages
object error maps to correct two failure cases in a principled manner. Our
second innovation is the introduction of a foreground consistency metric that
tracks points and their neighbors within each object instance to assess object
fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed metrics achieve
stronger correlations with human preferences at both the video level and the
model level (an improvement of more than 2% points), establishing DynamicEval
as a more comprehensive benchmark for evaluating T2V models under dynamic
camera motion.

### [3] [Provably Accelerated Imaging with Restarted Inertia and Score-based Image Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07470)
*Marien Renaud,Julien Hermant,Deliang Wei,Yu Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RISP是一种改进的RED算法，通过引入重启惯性机制实现快速收敛，同时保持基于分数的图像先验以获得高质量重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如RED专注于设计复杂图像先验来提高重建质量，但收敛加速通常依赖启发式方法。RISP旨在弥合这一差距。

Method: RISP在RED基础上引入了重启惯性机制，同时允许使用基于分数的图像先验。该方法还分析了相关的连续时间动力系统。

Result: 理论证明RISP比RED具有更快的驻点收敛速度，且不要求图像先验的凸性。实验表明RISP在各种成像逆问题中都能实现快速收敛和高质量重建。

Conclusion: RISP通过重启惯性机制成功实现了快速收敛和高重建质量的平衡，为成像逆问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Fast convergence and high-quality image recovery are two essential features
of algorithms for solving ill-posed imaging inverse problems. Existing methods,
such as regularization by denoising (RED), often focus on designing
sophisticated image priors to improve reconstruction quality, while leaving
convergence acceleration to heuristics. To bridge the gap, we propose Restarted
Inertia with Score-based Priors (RISP) as a principled extension of RED. RISP
incorporates a restarting inertia for fast convergence, while still allowing
score-based image priors for high-quality reconstruction. We prove that RISP
attains a faster stationary-point convergence rate than RED, without requiring
the convexity of the image prior. We further derive and analyze the associated
continuous-time dynamical system, offering insight into the connection between
RISP and the heavy-ball ordinary differential equation (ODE). Experiments
across a range of imaging inverse problems demonstrate that RISP enables fast
convergence while achieving high-quality reconstructions.

### [4] [A Denoising Framework for Real-World Ultra-Low Dose Lung CT Images Based on an Image Purification Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07492)
*Guoliang Gong,Man Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于图像纯化策略的超低剂量CT去噪框架，通过生成结构对齐的uLDCT-NDCT图像对，并结合频域流匹配模型，有效解决了真实临床uLDCT去噪中的数据不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超低剂量CT虽然显著降低了辐射暴露，但会引入严重的噪声和伪影，并且导致uLDCT与正常剂量CT图像对之间存在显著的空间不对齐问题，这给现有去噪网络的应用带来了挑战。

Method: 首先构建真实临床uLDCT肺部数据集，然后提出图像纯化策略生成结构对齐的图像对，最后提出频域流匹配模型与IP策略协同工作，保持去噪图像的解剖结构完整性。

Result: 在真实临床数据集上的实验表明，IP策略显著提升了多个主流去噪模型在uLDCT任务上的性能，特别是FFM模型结合IP策略在解剖结构保持方面达到了最先进水平。

Conclusion: 本研究为真实世界uLDCT去噪中的数据不匹配问题提供了有效解决方案，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Ultra-low dose CT (uLDCT) significantly reduces radiation exposure but
introduces severe noise and artifacts. It also leads to substantial spatial
misalignment between uLDCT and normal dose CT (NDCT) image pairs. This poses
challenges for directly applying existing denoising networks trained on
synthetic noise or aligned data. To address this core challenge in uLDCT
denoising, this paper proposes an innovative denoising framework based on an
Image Purification (IP) strategy. First, we construct a real clinical uLDCT
lung dataset. Then, we propose an Image Purification strategy that generates
structurally aligned uLDCT-NDCT image pairs, providing a high-quality data
foundation for network training. Building upon this, we propose a
Frequency-domain Flow Matching (FFM) model, which works synergistically with
the IP strategy to excellently preserve the anatomical structure integrity of
denoised images. Experiments on the real clinical dataset demonstrate that our
IP strategy significantly enhances the performance of multiple mainstream
denoising models on the uLDCT task. Notably, our proposed FFM model combined
with the IP strategy achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in anatomical
structure preservation. This study provides an effective solution to the data
mismatch problem in real-world uLDCT denoising. Code and dataset are available
at https://github.com/MonkeyDadLufy/flow-matching.

### [5] [D2RA: Dual Domain Regeneration Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07538)
*Pragati Shuddhodhan Meshram,Varun Chandrasekaran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的单图像攻击方法D2RA，能够在资源受限的对抗环境下有效移除或削弱水印，揭示了当前水印设计的根本弱点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型的广泛使用增加了对水印方法的需求，以确保内容归属和溯源。然而，现有的语义水印方案即使在资源受限的对抗环境下仍然脆弱。

Method: D2RA是一种无需训练的单图像攻击方法，通过将水印图像投影到互补表示的自然先验上，抑制水印信号同时保持视觉保真度。

Result: 在多种水印方案上的实验表明，该方法能持续降低水印可检测性，揭示了当前设计的根本弱点。

Conclusion: D2RA攻击方法暴露了当前水印方案的基本脆弱性，为改进水印鲁棒性提供了重要见解。

Abstract: The growing use of generative models has intensified the need for
watermarking methods that ensure content attribution and provenance. While
recent semantic watermarking schemes improve robustness by embedding signals in
latent or frequency representations, we show they remain vulnerable even under
resource-constrained adversarial settings. We present D2RA, a training-free,
single-image attack that removes or weakens watermarks without access to the
underlying model. By projecting watermarked images onto natural priors across
complementary representations, D2RA suppresses watermark signals while
preserving visual fidelity. Experiments across diverse watermarking schemes
demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces watermark detectability,
revealing fundamental weaknesses in current designs. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Pragati-Meshram/DAWN.

### [6] [PickStyle: Video-to-Video Style Transfer with Context-Style Adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07546)
*Soroush Mehraban,Vida Adeli,Jacob Rommann,Babak Taati,Kyryl Truskovskyi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PickStyle是一个基于扩散模型的视频风格迁移框架，通过插入低秩适配器和构建合成训练数据，实现了内容保持和风格转换的视频风格迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频风格迁移中缺乏成对视频数据监督的挑战，同时保持视频内容与目标风格之间的强对齐。

Method: 在预训练视频扩散模型中插入低秩适配器，使用成对静态图像数据构建合成训练片段，并提出了上下文-风格分类器自由引导(CS-CFG)方法。

Result: 在多个基准测试中实现了时间一致、风格忠实且内容保持的视频转换，在定性和定量评估上均优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: PickStyle框架通过有效的适配器设计和合成训练策略，成功解决了视频风格迁移中的数据稀缺问题，实现了高质量的视频风格转换。

Abstract: We address the task of video style transfer with diffusion models, where the
goal is to preserve the context of an input video while rendering it in a
target style specified by a text prompt. A major challenge is the lack of
paired video data for supervision. We propose PickStyle, a video-to-video style
transfer framework that augments pretrained video diffusion backbones with
style adapters and benefits from paired still image data with source-style
correspondences for training. PickStyle inserts low-rank adapters into the
self-attention layers of conditioning modules, enabling efficient
specialization for motion-style transfer while maintaining strong alignment
between video content and style. To bridge the gap between static image
supervision and dynamic video, we construct synthetic training clips from
paired images by applying shared augmentations that simulate camera motion,
ensuring temporal priors are preserved. In addition, we introduce Context-Style
Classifier-Free Guidance (CS-CFG), a novel factorization of classifier-free
guidance into independent text (style) and video (context) directions. CS-CFG
ensures that context is preserved in generated video while the style is
effectively transferred. Experiments across benchmarks show that our approach
achieves temporally coherent, style-faithful, and content-preserving video
translations, outperforming existing baselines both qualitatively and
quantitatively.

### [7] [TRAVL: A Recipe for Making Video-Language Models Better Judges of Physics Implausibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07550)
*Saman Motamed,Minghao Chen,Luc Van Gool,Iro Laina*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出TRAVL方法，通过平衡训练数据集和轨迹感知注意力模块来改进视频语言模型的物理合理性判断能力，并创建了ImplausiBench基准来评估物理推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视频生成模型经常产生违反物理规律的序列，但目前缺乏定量评估物理真实性的方法。研究发现现有视频语言模型难以识别物理违规，暴露了其在时间和因果推理方面的局限性。

Method: 引入TRAVL微调方法，结合平衡训练数据集和轨迹感知注意力模块来改进运动编码和判别能力。同时提出ImplausiBench基准，包含300个视频（150个真实，150个生成），消除语言偏见并隔离视觉-时间理解。

Result: 通过TRAVL方法改进了视频语言模型的物理合理性判断能力，并使用ImplausiBench基准进行更严格的评估，性能报告包括人类判断和LLM作为评判者的指标。

Conclusion: TRAVL和ImplausiBench提供了一个统一的框架，用于探索和改进多模态模型中的物理合理性，揭示了视觉-时间理解中具有挑战性且未被充分探索的方面。

Abstract: Despite impressive visual fidelity, modern video generative models frequently
produce sequences that violate intuitive physical laws, such as objects
floating, teleporting, or morphing in ways that defy causality. While humans
can easily detect such implausibilities, there remains no robust method for
quantitatively assessing physical realism in video. In this work, we explore
whether Video-Language Models (VLMs) can be trained to serve as reliable judges
of physical plausibility. We find that existing VLMs struggle to identify
physics violations, exposing fundamental limitations in their temporal and
causal reasoning. To address this, we introduce TRAVL, a fine-tuning recipe
that combines a balanced training dataset with a trajectory-aware attention
module to improve motion encoding and discrimination in VLMs. To evaluate
physical reasoning more rigorously, we propose ImplausiBench, a benchmark of
300 videos (150 real, 150 generated) that removes linguistic biases and
isolates visual-temporal understanding. Performance is reported both with
gold-standard human judgments and stricter LLM-as-judge metrics. Together,
TRAVL and ImplausiBench offer a unified framework for probing and improving
physical plausibility in multimodal models, shedding light on a challenging and
underexplored aspect of visual-temporal understanding.

### [8] [IsoSignVid2Aud: Sign Language Video to Audio Conversion without Text Intermediaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07837)
*Harsh Kavediya,Vighnesh Nayak,Bheeshm Sharma,Balamurugan Palaniappan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出IsoSignVid2Aud端到端框架，将孤立手语视频直接翻译为语音，无需中间文本表示，避免多阶段系统的延迟和级联错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连接听力障碍和言语障碍人群与其他人，特别是在教育应用和手语提示界面中处理孤立手语序列视频。

Method: 结合I3D特征提取模块、专用特征转换网络和音频生成流水线，使用新颖的非最大抑制算法进行非语法连续序列中手语的时间检测。

Result: 在ASL-Citizen-1500和WLASL-100数据集上分别达到72.01%和78.67%的Top-1准确率，音频质量指标显示可理解的语音输出。

Conclusion: 该方法在孤立手语视频到语音翻译方面表现出竞争力，为即时通信提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Sign language to spoken language audio translation is important to connect
the hearing- and speech-challenged humans with others. We consider sign
language videos with isolated sign sequences rather than continuous grammatical
signing. Such videos are useful in educational applications and sign prompt
interfaces. Towards this, we propose IsoSignVid2Aud, a novel end-to-end
framework that translates sign language videos with a sequence of possibly
non-grammatic continuous signs to speech without requiring intermediate text
representation, providing immediate communication benefits while avoiding the
latency and cascading errors inherent in multi-stage translation systems. Our
approach combines an I3D-based feature extraction module with a specialized
feature transformation network and an audio generation pipeline, utilizing a
novel Non-Maximal Suppression (NMS) algorithm for the temporal detection of
signs in non-grammatic continuous sequences. Experimental results demonstrate
competitive performance on ASL-Citizen-1500 and WLASL-100 datasets with Top-1
accuracies of 72.01\% and 78.67\%, respectively, and audio quality metrics
(PESQ: 2.67, STOI: 0.73) indicating intelligible speech output. Code is

### [9] [Label Semantics for Robust Hyperspectral Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07556)
*Rafin Hassan,Zarin Tasnim Roshni,Rafiqul Bari,Alimul Islam,Nabeel Mohammed,Moshiur Farazi,Shafin Rahman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种语义光谱-空间融合网络(S3FN)，通过结合类别特定的文本描述来增强高光谱图像分类性能，解决了传统单模态模型仅依赖光谱-空间数据导致的过拟合和精度-复杂度平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像分类面临高质量训练样本有限、数据维度高导致的过拟合问题，且现有模型多为单模态，仅依赖光谱-空间数据学习决策边界。需要引入额外信息来提升分类性能。

Method: 使用大语言模型为每个类别生成详细的文本描述，捕获其独特特征和光谱行为，然后通过预训练文本编码器将描述嵌入向量空间，提取有意义的标签语义以实现更好的特征-标签对齐。

Result: 在三个高光谱基准数据集上评估，包括Hyperspectral Wood、HyperspectralBlueberries和DeepHS-Fruit，报告了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 文本语义与光谱-空间数据之间存在协同效应，为语义增强的高光谱图像分类模型的发展开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) classification is a critical tool with widespread
applications across diverse fields such as agriculture, environmental
monitoring, medicine, and materials science. Due to the limited availability of
high-quality training samples and the high dimensionality of spectral data, HSI
classification models are prone to overfitting and often face challenges in
balancing accuracy and computational complexity. Furthermore, most of HSI
classification models are monomodal, where it solely relies on spectral-spatial
data to learn decision boundaries in the high dimensional embedding space. To
address this, we propose a general-purpose Semantic Spectral-Spatial Fusion
Network (S3FN) that uses contextual, class specific textual descriptions to
complement the training of an HSI classification model. Specifically, S3FN
leverages LLMs to generate comprehensive textual descriptions for each class
label that captures their unique characteristics and spectral behaviors. These
descriptions are then embedded into a vector space using a pre-trained text
encoder such as BERT or RoBERTa to extract meaningful label semantics which in
turn leads to a better feature-label alignment for improved classification
performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate our
model on three diverse HSI benchmark datasets - Hyperspectral Wood,
HyperspectralBlueberries, and DeepHS-Fruit and report significant performance
boost. Our results highlight the synergy between textual semantics and
spectral-spatial data, paving the way for further advancements in semantically
augmented HSI classification models. Codes are be available in:

### [10] [Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07567)
*Karuna Bhaila,Aneesh Komanduri,Minh-Hao Van,Xintao Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于视觉语言模型的轻量级遗忘框架CAGUL，通过跨模态注意力引导来防止敏感信息泄露，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在训练过程中可能记忆并泄露私密敏感信息，而现有的遗忘方法主要针对文本模型，视觉模态增加了复杂性。

Method: 利用跨模态注意力分析视觉token对输出的重要性，通过外部模块对低重要性视觉token进行编码来实现遗忘，不改变预训练模型参数。

Result: 实验表明该方法性能优于或等同于基于微调的基线方法，能有效防止信息泄露并保持参考模型行为。

Conclusion: CAGUL为视觉语言模型提供了一种实用有效的遗忘解决方案，无需重新训练或修改预训练参数。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated immense capabilities in
multi-modal understanding and inference tasks such as Visual Question Answering
(VQA), which requires models to infer outputs based on visual and textual
context simultaneously. Such inference abilities of large-scale pretrained
models are often attributed to the massive scale of pre-training data collected
across several domains. However, the models may memorize private and/or
sensitive information during training and regurgitate it in inference.
Recently, machine unlearning has been leveraged to address the leakage of
private data in LLMs. VLMs add a layer of complexity to this process, as the
visual context in the query may also contain sensitive information in addition
to the text. To address this issue, we explore unlearning for vision-language
models, specifically for the VQA task. We explore the role of visual tokens for
output generation in VLMs using cross-modal attention and utilize it to
formulate Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning (CAGUL), a lightweight and
efficient VLM unlearning framework. In contrast to computationally expensive
model finetuning methods, CAGUL utilizes external modules to encode unlearning
information in visual tokens of low importance for relevant queries. We find
that the transformed visual tokens not only prevent leakage but also retain
reference model behavior. Experimental results show that our method performs
better or on par with finetuning-based baselines without altering the
pre-trained model parameters or incurring retraining costs, making it a
practical and effective unlearning solution for VLMs.

### [11] [MaizeStandCounting (MaSC): Automated and Accurate Maize Stand Counting from UAV Imagery Using Image Processing and Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07580)
*Dewi Endah Kharismawati,Toni Kazic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MaizeStandCounting (MaSC)算法，使用轻量级YOLOv9模型从无人机RGB图像自动计数玉米幼苗，支持两种处理模式：拼接图像分块和原始视频帧对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工计数玉米株数耗时费力且容易出错，特别是在大面积或变化较大的田地中，需要自动化解决方案来支持作物管理和研究。

Method: 使用轻量级YOLOv9模型检测V2-V10生长阶段的玉米幼苗，区分玉米与杂草，基于检测结果的空间分布进行行和范围分割，生成精确的行级株数统计。

Result: 与2024年夏季苗圃实地人工计数相比，拼接图像模式R^2=0.616，原始帧模式R^2=0.906；处理83张全分辨率帧仅需60.63秒，具备实时操作潜力。

Conclusion: MaSC是一个可扩展、低成本且准确的自动化玉米株数计数工具，适用于研究和生产环境。

Abstract: Accurate maize stand counts are essential for crop management and research,
informing yield prediction, planting density optimization, and early detection
of germination issues. Manual counting is labor-intensive, slow, and
error-prone, especially across large or variable fields. We present
MaizeStandCounting (MaSC), a robust algorithm for automated maize seedling
stand counting from RGB imagery captured by low-cost UAVs and processed on
affordable hardware. MaSC operates in two modes: (1) mosaic images divided into
patches, and (2) raw video frames aligned using homography matrices. Both modes
use a lightweight YOLOv9 model trained to detect maize seedlings from V2-V10
growth stages. MaSC distinguishes maize from weeds and other vegetation, then
performs row and range segmentation based on the spatial distribution of
detections to produce precise row-wise stand counts. Evaluation against
in-field manual counts from our 2024 summer nursery showed strong agreement
with ground truth (R^2= 0.616 for mosaics, R^2 = 0.906 for raw frames). MaSC
processed 83 full-resolution frames in 60.63 s, including inference and
post-processing, highlighting its potential for real-time operation. These
results demonstrate MaSC's effectiveness as a scalable, low-cost, and accurate
tool for automated maize stand counting in both research and production
environments.

*Pouya Shiri,Ramin Sharifi,Amirali Baniasadi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Quick-CapsNet（QCN）作为Capsule Network的快速替代方案，通过减少胶囊数量实现5倍推理速度提升，但精度略有损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CapsNet在检测重叠数字和对抗仿射变换方面优于传统CNN，但训练和测试速度慢，限制了其在需要快速网络的实时应用中的使用。

Method: 通过生成更少的胶囊来构建更快的网络，并采用更强大的解码器来进一步提升性能。

Result: 在MNIST、F-MNIST、SVHN和Cifar-10数据集上实现5倍推理速度提升，但精度有轻微损失。

Conclusion: QCN是CapsNet的快速替代方案，可作为开发快速实时应用的起点，在保持良好性能的同时显著提升速度。

Abstract: The basic computational unit in Capsule Network (CapsNet) is a capsule (vs.
neurons in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)). A capsule is a set of
neurons, which form a vector. CapsNet is used for supervised classification of
data and has achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on MNIST digit recognition
dataset, outperforming conventional CNNs in detecting overlapping digits.
Moreover, CapsNet shows higher robustness towards affine transformation when
compared to CNNs for MNIST datasets. One of the drawbacks of CapsNet, however,
is slow training and testing. This can be a bottleneck for applications that
require a fast network, especially during inference. In this work, we introduce
Quick-CapsNet (QCN) as a fast alternative to CapsNet, which can be a starting
point to develop CapsNet for fast real-time applications. QCN builds on
producing a fewer number of capsules, which results in a faster network. QCN
achieves this at the cost of marginal loss in accuracy. Inference is 5x faster
on MNIST, F-MNIST, SVHN and Cifar-10 datasets. We also further enhanced QCN by
employing a more powerful decoder instead of the default decoder to further
improve QCN.

### [13] [Rectified-CFG++ for Flow Based Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07631)
*Shreshth Saini,Shashank Gupta,Alan C. Bovik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Rectified-CFG++，一种自适应预测器-校正器引导方法，解决了标准CFG在整流流模型中的离流形漂移问题，通过几何感知的条件规则确保轨迹稳定在数据流形附近。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准分类器自由引导(CFG)在整流流(RF)模型中的应用会导致严重的离流形漂移，产生视觉伪影、文本不对齐和不稳定行为。

Method: 自适应预测器-校正器引导，每个推理步骤先执行条件RF更新将样本锚定在学习到的传输路径附近，然后应用加权条件校正，在条件和无条件速度场之间插值。

Result: 在MS-COCO、LAION-Aesthetic和T2I-CompBench等基准数据集上，Rectified-CFG++在Flux、Stable Diffusion 3/3.5、Lumina等大规模文生图模型中一致优于标准CFG。

Conclusion: Rectified-CFG++将整流流的确定性效率与几何感知条件规则相结合，确保速度场的边际一致性和轨迹在数据流形有界管状邻域内的稳定性。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is the workhorse for steering large diffusion
models toward text-conditioned targets, yet its native application to rectified
flow (RF) based models provokes severe off-manifold drift, yielding visual
artifacts, text misalignment, and brittle behaviour. We present
Rectified-CFG++, an adaptive predictor-corrector guidance that couples the
deterministic efficiency of rectified flows with a geometry-aware conditioning
rule. Each inference step first executes a conditional RF update that anchors
the sample near the learned transport path, then applies a weighted conditional
correction that interpolates between conditional and unconditional velocity
fields. We prove that the resulting velocity field is marginally consistent and
that its trajectories remain within a bounded tubular neighbourhood of the data
manifold, ensuring stability across a wide range of guidance strengths.
Extensive experiments on large-scale text-to-image models (Flux, Stable
Diffusion 3/3.5, Lumina) show that Rectified-CFG++ consistently outperforms
standard CFG on benchmark datasets such as MS-COCO, LAION-Aesthetic, and

### [14] [PIT-QMM: A Large Multimodal Model For No-Reference Point Cloud Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07636)
*Shashank Gupta,Gregoire Phillips,Alan C. Bovik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PIT-QMM，一种新型的大型多模态模型，用于无参考点云质量评估，能够端到端处理文本、图像和点云数据，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型在图像和视频质量评估方面取得了显著进展，但在3D资产领域的应用尚未充分探索。研究者希望利用这些模型进行无参考点云质量评估，自动评估点云的感知质量。

Result: 在流行的基准测试中，所提出的方法以更少的训练迭代次数显著优于现有最先进方法。框架还支持失真定位和识别，为模型可解释性和交互性开辟了新途径。

Conclusion: PIT-QMM在无参考点云质量评估方面表现出色，不仅提升了评估性能，还增强了模型的可解释性和交互能力，为3D资产质量评估提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have recently enabled considerable advances in
the realm of image and video quality assessment, but this progress has yet to
be fully explored in the domain of 3D assets. We are interested in using these
models to conduct No-Reference Point Cloud Quality Assessment (NR-PCQA), where
the aim is to automatically evaluate the perceptual quality of a point cloud in
absence of a reference. We begin with the observation that different modalities
of data - text descriptions, 2D projections, and 3D point cloud views - provide
complementary information about point cloud quality. We then construct PIT-QMM,
a novel LMM for NR-PCQA that is capable of consuming text, images and point
clouds end-to-end to predict quality scores. Extensive experimentation shows
that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art by significant
margins on popular benchmarks with fewer training iterations. We also
demonstrate that our framework enables distortion localization and
identification, which paves a new way forward for model explainability and
interactivity. Code and datasets are available at

TL;DR: 提出DSA Net双流对齐网络，通过融合帧级和动作级特征，结合量子-经典混合学习框架，在动作分割任务中实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动作分割方法多为单流方法，主要关注帧序列的时空建模。近期研究转向双流方法学习动作特征来提升分割性能，但如何有效融合双流信息仍是挑战。

Method: 提出Dual-Stream Alignment Network (DSA Net)，包含帧级和动作级双流，通过Temporal Context块融合互补信息，使用交叉注意力和量子引导调制。采用双流对齐损失函数，包含关系一致性、跨层对比和循环一致性重建损失。

Conclusion: 这是首个将量子-经典混合机器学习框架引入动作分割的研究，通过双流特征对齐和量子调制机制，有效提升了动作分割性能。

Abstract: Action segmentation is a challenging yet active research area that involves
identifying when and where specific actions occur in continuous video streams.
Most existing work has focused on single-stream approaches that model the
spatio-temporal aspects of frame sequences. However, recent research has
shifted toward two-stream methods that learn action-wise features to enhance
action segmentation performance. In this work, we propose the Dual-Stream
Alignment Network (DSA Net) and investigate the impact of incorporating a
second stream of learned action features to guide segmentation by capturing
both action and action-transition cues. Communication between the two streams
is facilitated by a Temporal Context (TC) block, which fuses complementary
information using cross-attention and Quantum-based Action-Guided Modulation
(Q-ActGM), enhancing the expressive power of the fused features. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first study to introduce a hybrid quantum-classical
machine learning framework for action segmentation. Our primary objective is
for the two streams (frame-wise and action-wise) to learn a shared feature
space through feature alignment. This is encouraged by the proposed Dual-Stream
Alignment Loss, which comprises three components: relational consistency,
cross-level contrastive, and cycle-consistency reconstruction losses. Following
prior work, we evaluate DSA Net on several diverse benchmark datasets: GTEA,
Breakfast, 50Salads, and EgoProcel. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of
each component through extensive ablation studies. Notably, DSA Net achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing

*Yanjie Pan,Qingdong He,Lidong Wang,Bo Peng,Mingmin Chi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出OIE方法，基于首帧服装替换的视频虚拟试穿策略，通过图像模型替换首帧服装，再利用姿势和掩码信息引导视频生成模型合成后续帧，实现参数和计算效率的显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有双分支架构在基于Diffusion Transformer的扩散模型中面临的参数过多和服装特征缺乏时序特性的挑战。

Method: 使用图像服装替换模型处理首帧，然后在编辑后的首帧内容控制下，利用姿势和掩码信息引导视频生成模型顺序合成剩余帧。

Result: 在保持领先性能的同时，实现了优越的参数效率和计算效率。

Conclusion: OIE方法通过首帧服装替换策略有效解决了现有方法的参数和时序学习问题，为视频虚拟试穿提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to replace the clothing of a person in a video with
a target garment. Current dual-branch architectures have achieved significant
success in diffusion models based on the U-Net; however, adapting them to
diffusion models built upon the Diffusion Transformer remains challenging.
Initially, introducing latent space features from the garment reference branch
requires adding or modifying the backbone network, leading to a large number of
trainable parameters. Subsequently, the latent space features of garments lack
inherent temporal characteristics and thus require additional learning. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel approach, OIE (Once is Enough), a
virtual try-on strategy based on first-frame clothing replacement:
specifically, we employ an image-based clothing transfer model to replace the
clothing in the initial frame, and then, under the content control of the
edited first frame, utilize pose and mask information to guide the temporal
prior of the video generation model in synthesizing the remaining frames
sequentially. Experiments show that our method achieves superior parameter
efficiency and computational efficiency while still maintaining leading
performance under these constraints.

### [17] [MONKEY: Masking ON KEY-Value Activation Adapter for Personalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07656)
*James Baker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用IP-Adapter自动生成掩码的方法，通过二次处理将图像标记限制在主体区域，让文本提示能够更好地控制背景生成，从而提高个性化扩散模型的提示对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有个性化扩散模型在生成图像时往往过度关注主体而忽略文本提示，导致生成的图像只是简单复制主体而未能准确响应文本描述。

Method: 利用IP-Adapter在推理过程中自动生成的主体分割掩码，在第二次处理中限制图像标记仅作用于主体区域，使文本提示能够专注于控制背景内容的生成。

Result: 该方法在描述位置和场景的文本提示下，能够生成既准确描绘主体又完全匹配提示的图像，相比其他测试时个性化方法显示出更高的提示和源图像对齐度。

Conclusion: 通过自动掩码机制将主体与背景分离处理，有效解决了个性化扩散模型中主体过度主导的问题，显著提升了文本提示的控制能力和生成质量。

Abstract: Personalizing diffusion models allows users to generate new images that
incorporate a given subject, allowing more control than a text prompt. These
models often suffer somewhat when they end up just recreating the subject
image, and ignoring the text prompt. We observe that one popular method for
personalization, the IP-Adapter automatically generates masks that we
definitively segment the subject from the background during inference. We
propose to use this automatically generated mask on a second pass to mask the
image tokens, thus restricting them to the subject, not the background,
allowing the text prompt to attend to the rest of the image. For text prompts
describing locations and places, this produces images that accurately depict
the subject while definitively matching the prompt. We compare our method to a
few other test time personalization methods, and find our method displays high
prompt and source image alignment.

Motivation: 在广告和网页布局设计中，平衡视觉吸引力和沟通效率至关重要，本研究旨在探索自动化文本框布局的最佳方法。

Method: 比较了标准Transformer方法、小型视觉语言模型Phi3.5-vision、大型预训练VLM Gemini以及处理多图像的扩展Transformer在Crello数据集上的表现。

Result: 标准Transformer模型通常优于VLM方法，特别是在包含丰富外观信息时。所有方法在处理极小文本或密集布局时都面临挑战。

Conclusion: 任务特定架构具有优势，为自动化布局设计的进一步改进指明了方向。

Abstract: In layout design for advertisements and web pages, balancing visual appeal
and communication efficiency is crucial. This study examines automated text box
placement in incomplete layouts, comparing a standard Transformer-based method,
a small Vision and Language Model (Phi3.5-vision), a large pretrained VLM
(Gemini), and an extended Transformer that processes multiple images.
Evaluations on the Crello dataset show the standard Transformer-based models
generally outperform VLM-based approaches, particularly when incorporating
richer appearance information. However, all methods face challenges with very
small text or densely populated layouts. These findings highlight the benefits
of task-specific architectures and suggest avenues for further improvement in
automated layout design.

*Heming Wu,Di Wang,Tai Ma,Peng Zhao,Yubin Xiao,Zhongke Wu,Xing-Ce Wang,Chuang Li,Xuan Wu,You Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出TCIP模型，通过特征增强残差模块(FERM)减少解剖结构错位累积，并采用双阶段阈值控制迭代(TCI)策略自适应确定迭代次数，在多个医学图像数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金字塔网络在可变形医学图像配准中表现优异，但其解码器架构容易传播和累积解剖结构错位，且现有模型无法自适应确定不同图像变形需求下的迭代次数，导致配准精度下降。

Method: 提出特征增强残差模块(FERM)作为金字塔网络解码层的核心组件，包含三个顺序块：提取解剖语义特征、抑制无关特征、估计最终变形场。提出双阶段阈值控制迭代(TCI)策略，第一阶段评估配准稳定性，第二阶段评估收敛性。

Result: 在三个公共脑部MRI数据集和一个腹部CT数据集上的实验表明，TCIP在准确性方面优于最先进的配准网络，同时保持相当的推理速度和紧凑的模型参数大小。

Conclusion: TCIP模型通过FERM和TCI的有效结合，显著提高了医学图像配准的精度和适应性，具有良好的泛化能力和实用性。

Abstract: Although pyramid networks have demonstrated superior performance in
deformable medical image registration, their decoder architectures are
inherently prone to propagating and accumulating anatomical structure
misalignments. Moreover, most existing models do not adaptively determine the
number of iterations for optimization under varying deformation requirements
across images, resulting in either premature termination or excessive
iterations that degrades registration accuracy. To effectively mitigate the
accumulation of anatomical misalignments, we propose the Feature-Enhanced
Residual Module (FERM) as the core component of each decoding layer in the
pyramid network. FERM comprises three sequential blocks that extract anatomical
semantic features, learn to suppress irrelevant features, and estimate the
final deformation field, respectively. To adaptively determine the number of
iterations for varying images, we propose the dual-stage Threshold-Controlled
Iterative (TCI) strategy. In the first stage, TCI assesses registration
stability and with asserted stability, it continues with the second stage to
evaluate convergence. We coin the model that integrates FERM and TCI as
Threshold-Controlled Iterative Pyramid (TCIP). Extensive experiments on three
public brain MRI datasets and one abdomen CT dataset demonstrate that TCIP
outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) registration networks in terms of
accuracy, while maintaining comparable inference speed and a compact model
parameter size. Finally, we assess the generalizability of FERM and TCI by
integrating them with existing registration networks and further conduct
ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of these two proposed methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种视频合成方法，支持从精确的4D对象轨迹到粗略文本提示的多粒度用户控制，通过变分推断和KL散度最小化实现高可控性和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型通常针对固定输入格式训练，无法满足需要混合粒度控制的工作流程需求。

Method: 将任务建模为变分推断问题，利用多个视频生成主干网络，通过逐步KL散度最小化和上下文条件分解技术解决优化挑战。

Result: 实验表明该方法在可控性、多样性和3D一致性方面优于现有工作。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了对指定元素的高可控性，同时对未指定元素保持多样性，解决了视频生成中的混合控制需求。

Abstract: Many video workflows benefit from a mixture of user controls with varying
granularity, from exact 4D object trajectories and camera paths to coarse text
prompts, while existing video generative models are typically trained for fixed
input formats. We develop a video synthesis method that addresses this need and
generates samples with high controllability for specified elements while
maintaining diversity for under-specified ones. We cast the task as variational
inference to approximate a composed distribution, leveraging multiple video
generation backbones to account for all task constraints collectively. To
address the optimization challenge, we break down the problem into step-wise KL
divergence minimization over an annealed sequence of distributions, and further
propose a context-conditioned factorization technique that reduces modes in the
solution space to circumvent local optima. Experiments suggest that our method
produces samples with improved controllability, diversity, and 3D consistency
compared to prior works.

Abstract: Induction motors (IMs) are indispensable in industrial and daily life, but
they are susceptible to various faults that can lead to overheating, wasted
energy consumption, and service failure. Early detection of faults is essential
to protect the motor and prolong its lifespan. This paper presents a hybrid
method that integrates BYOL with CNNs for classifying thermal images of
induction motors for fault detection. The thermal dataset used in this work
includes different operating states of the motor, such as normal operation,
overload, and faults. We employed multiple deep learning (DL) models for the
BYOL technique, ranging from popular architectures such as ResNet-50,
DenseNet-121, DenseNet-169, EfficientNetB0, VGG16, and MobileNetV2.
Additionally, we introduced a new high-performance yet lightweight CNN model
named BYOL-IMNet, which comprises four custom-designed blocks tailored for
fault classification in thermal images. Our experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed BYOL-IMNet achieves 99.89\% test accuracy and an inference
time of 5.7 ms per image, outperforming state-of-the-art models. This study
highlights the promising performance of the CNN-BYOL hybrid method in enhancing
accuracy for detecting faults in induction motors, offering a robust
methodology for online monitoring in industrial settings.

*Xiaoxu Ma,Runhao Li,Zhenyu Weng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MLH的弱到强框架，通过将成对哈希分支的知识迁移到中心哈希分支，结合局部相似性和全局分布信息，提升深度哈希性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中心哈希方法虽然能有效捕捉全局数据分布，但往往忽略了重要的局部相似性信息，限制了其性能。

Method: 采用双分支结构：强中心哈希分支和弱成对哈希分支，通过迭代式相互学习和混合哈希专家模块实现跨分支交互。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，MLH始终优于最先进的哈希方法。

Conclusion: MLH框架成功地将局部相似性信息融入中心哈希方法，实现了更好的哈希函数学习效果。

Abstract: Deep hashing has been widely adopted for large-scale image retrieval, with
numerous strategies proposed to optimize hash function learning. Pairwise-based
methods are effective in learning hash functions that preserve local similarity
relationships, whereas center-based methods typically achieve superior
performance by more effectively capturing global data distributions. However,
the strength of center-based methods in modeling global structures often comes
at the expense of underutilizing important local similarity information. To
address this limitation, we propose Mutual Learning for Hashing (MLH), a novel
weak-to-strong framework that enhances a center-based hashing branch by
transferring knowledge from a weaker pairwise-based branch. MLH consists of two
branches: a strong center-based branch and a weaker pairwise-based branch.
Through an iterative mutual learning process, the center-based branch leverages
local similarity cues learned by the pairwise-based branch. Furthermore,
inspired by the mixture-of-experts paradigm, we introduce a novel
mixture-of-hash-experts module that enables effective cross-branch interaction,
further enhancing the performance of both branches. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MLH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods
across multiple benchmark datasets.

Motivation: 电商平台中产品图像的水印和促销文本等侵入性元素阻碍了清晰吸引人的产品视觉展示，现有扩散修复方法在商业场景中面临对象移除不可靠和领域适应性有限的问题。

Method: 结合空间遮罩轨迹优化与Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)，通过调节注意力机制强调背景上下文，生成高奖励样本并减少不需要的对象插入；引入复合奖励机制平衡全局、局部和语义约束。

Result: Repainter在复杂场景中显著优于现有最先进方法，创建了EcomPaint-100K高质量大规模电商修复数据集和标准化基准EcomPaint-Bench。

Conclusion: Repainter框架有效解决了电商图像修复中的关键挑战，为商业应用提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: In web data, product images are central to boosting user engagement and
advertising efficacy on e-commerce platforms, yet the intrusive elements such
as watermarks and promotional text remain major obstacles to delivering clear
and appealing product visuals. Although diffusion-based inpainting methods have
advanced, they still face challenges in commercial settings due to unreliable
object removal and limited domain-specific adaptation. To tackle these
challenges, we propose Repainter, a reinforcement learning framework that
integrates spatial-matting trajectory refinement with Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). Our approach modulates attention mechanisms to emphasize
background context, generating higher-reward samples and reducing unwanted
object insertion. We also introduce a composite reward mechanism that balances
global, local, and semantic constraints, effectively reducing visual artifacts
and reward hacking. Additionally, we contribute EcomPaint-100K, a high-quality,
large-scale e-commerce inpainting dataset, and a standardized benchmark
EcomPaint-Bench for fair evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Repainter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in
challenging scenes with intricate compositions. We will release our code and
weights upon acceptance.

Abstract: Embodied Reference Understanding requires identifying a target object in a
visual scene based on both language instructions and pointing cues. While prior
works have shown progress in open-vocabulary object detection, they often fail
in ambiguous scenarios where multiple candidate objects exist in the scene. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel ERU framework that jointly
leverages LLM-based data augmentation, depth-map modality, and a depth-aware
decision module. This design enables robust integration of linguistic and
embodied cues, improving disambiguation in complex or cluttered environments.
Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving more accurate and
reliable referent detection.

Abstract: Photorealistic 3D full-body human reconstruction from a single image is a
critical yet challenging task for applications in films and video games due to
inherent ambiguities and severe self-occlusions. While recent approaches
leverage SMPL estimation and SMPL-conditioned image generative models to
hallucinate novel views, they suffer from inaccurate 3D priors estimated from
SMPL meshes and have difficulty in handling difficult human poses and
reconstructing fine details. In this paper, we propose SyncHuman, a novel
framework that combines 2D multiview generative model and 3D native generative
model for the first time, enabling high-quality clothed human mesh
reconstruction from single-view images even under challenging human poses.
Multiview generative model excels at capturing fine 2D details but struggles
with structural consistency, whereas 3D native generative model generates
coarse yet structurally consistent 3D shapes. By integrating the complementary
strengths of these two approaches, we develop a more effective generation
framework. Specifically, we first jointly fine-tune the multiview generative
model and the 3D native generative model with proposed pixel-aligned 2D-3D
synchronization attention to produce geometrically aligned 3D shapes and 2D
multiview images. To further improve details, we introduce a feature injection
mechanism that lifts fine details from 2D multiview images onto the aligned 3D
shapes, enabling accurate and high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SyncHuman achieves robust and photo-realistic 3D
human reconstruction, even for images with challenging poses. Our method
outperforms baseline methods in geometric accuracy and visual fidelity,
demonstrating a promising direction for future 3D generation models.

TL;DR: 提出了ComGS框架，通过Surface Octahedral Probes实现高效可重光照物体重建和基于扩散模型的场景光照估计，解决了高斯泼溅中物体-场景组合的不一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高斯泼溅(GS)虽然能够实现沉浸式渲染，但在3D物体-场景组合时存在挑战。由于GS辐射场中烘焙的外观和阴影信息，导致物体和场景组合时出现不一致。需要可重光照的物体重建和场景光照估计来解决这一问题。

Method: 1. 引入Surface Octahedral Probes(SOPs)存储光照和遮挡信息，通过插值实现高效3D查询，避免昂贵的射线追踪；2. 简化场景光照估计，聚焦于物体放置位置的环境光照，使用扩散模型完成光照；3. 提出ComGS框架整合这些技术。

Result: SOPs在重建中提供至少2倍加速，支持高斯场景中的实时阴影计算。ComGS实现约28 FPS的高质量实时渲染，产生视觉和谐的带生动阴影的结果，编辑仅需36秒。

Conclusion: ComGS框架成功解决了高斯泼溅中物体-场景组合的挑战，通过高效的可重光照重建和简化的光照估计，实现了高质量的实时渲染和快速编辑。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) enables immersive rendering, but realistic 3D
object-scene composition remains challenging. Baked appearance and shadow
information in GS radiance fields cause inconsistencies when combining objects
and scenes. Addressing this requires relightable object reconstruction and
scene lighting estimation. For relightable object reconstruction, existing
Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods often rely on ray tracing, leading to
low efficiency. We introduce Surface Octahedral Probes (SOPs), which store
lighting and occlusion information and allow efficient 3D querying via
interpolation, avoiding expensive ray tracing. SOPs provide at least a 2x
speedup in reconstruction and enable real-time shadow computation in Gaussian
scenes. For lighting estimation, existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering
methods struggle to model intricate light transport and often fail in complex
scenes, while learning-based methods predict lighting from a single image and
are viewpoint-sensitive. We observe that 3D object-scene composition primarily
concerns the object's appearance and nearby shadows. Thus, we simplify the
challenging task of full scene lighting estimation by focusing on the
environment lighting at the object's placement. Specifically, we capture a 360
degrees reconstructed radiance field of the scene at the location and fine-tune
a diffusion model to complete the lighting. Building on these advances, we
propose ComGS, a novel 3D object-scene composition framework. Our method
achieves high-quality, real-time rendering at around 28 FPS, produces visually
harmonious results with vivid shadows, and requires only 36 seconds for
editing. Code and dataset are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出UltraLED框架，仅使用单帧短曝光RAW图像实现超高动态范围重建，通过曝光校正和亮度感知RAW降噪来恢复暗区细节，避免了多帧方法中的重影和运动模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决超高动态范围场景中亮暗区域曝光差异大的问题，传统RGB包围曝光方法容易产生重影和对齐问题，而单帧短曝光RAW图像具有更高位深和可预测噪声特性，为UHDR重建提供了新可能。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：首先通过比率图进行曝光校正以平衡动态范围，然后使用亮度感知RAW降噪器增强暗区细节恢复。构建了9档包围曝光流程合成真实UHDR图像数据集。

Result: 实验表明UltraLED显著优于现有的单帧方法，能够有效恢复暗区细节同时保持高光细节，在动态场景中表现稳健。

Conclusion: 仅使用单帧短曝光RAW图像即可实现高质量的UHDR重建，避免了多帧方法的局限性，为实际应用提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Ultra-high dynamic range (UHDR) scenes exhibit significant exposure
disparities between bright and dark regions. Such conditions are commonly
encountered in nighttime scenes with light sources. Even with standard exposure
settings, a bimodal intensity distribution with boundary peaks often emerges,
making it difficult to preserve both highlight and shadow details
simultaneously. RGB-based bracketing methods can capture details at both ends
using short-long exposure pairs, but are susceptible to misalignment and
ghosting artifacts. We found that a short-exposure image already retains
sufficient highlight detail. The main challenge of UHDR reconstruction lies in
denoising and recovering information in dark regions. In comparison to the RGB
images, RAW images, thanks to their higher bit depth and more predictable noise
characteristics, offer greater potential for addressing this challenge. This
raises a key question: can we learn to see everything in UHDR scenes using only
a single short-exposure RAW image? In this study, we rely solely on a single
short-exposure frame, which inherently avoids ghosting and motion blur, making
it particularly robust in dynamic scenes. To achieve that, we introduce
UltraLED, a two-stage framework that performs exposure correction via a ratio
map to balance dynamic range, followed by a brightness-aware RAW denoiser to
enhance detail recovery in dark regions. To support this setting, we design a
9-stop bracketing pipeline to synthesize realistic UHDR images and contribute a
corresponding dataset based on diverse scenes, using only the shortest exposure
as input for reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that UltraLED
significantly outperforms existing single-frame approaches. Our code and
dataset are made publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合低帧率RGB视频和高帧率事件流来重建动态3D高斯泼溅的新框架，通过事件运动先验指导变形场优化，解决大帧间运动带来的不确定性挑战。


<details>

Motivation: 低帧率RGB视频重建动态3D高斯泼溅面临大帧间运动导致解空间不确定性的挑战，而事件相机能捕捉快速视觉变化且抗运动模糊，但缺乏颜色信息。结合两种模态可以互补优势。

Method: 采用事件运动先验指导变形场优化：1) 使用LoCM无监督微调框架提取事件流中的运动先验；2) 提出几何感知数据关联方法建立事件-高斯运动对应关系；3) 采用运动分解和帧间伪标签策略。

Result: 在合成和真实场景上的广泛实验表明，该方法优于现有的基于图像和事件的方法，证明事件数据能有效优化动态3D高斯泼溅。

Conclusion: 通过结合RGB和事件模态，利用事件运动先验指导变形场优化，成功解决了低帧率视频重建动态3D高斯泼溅时的大帧间运动不确定性挑战。

Abstract: Reconstructing Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) from low-framerate RGB
videos is challenging. This is because large inter-frame motions will increase
the uncertainty of the solution space. For example, one pixel in the first
frame might have more choices to reach the corresponding pixel in the second
frame. Event cameras can asynchronously capture rapid visual changes and are
robust to motion blur, but they do not provide color information. Intuitively,
the event stream can provide deterministic constraints for the inter-frame
large motion by the event trajectories. Hence, combining
low-temporal-resolution images with high-framerate event streams can address
this challenge. However, it is challenging to jointly optimize Dynamic 3DGS
using both RGB and event modalities due to the significant discrepancy between
these two data modalities. This paper introduces a novel framework that jointly
optimizes dynamic 3DGS from the two modalities. The key idea is to adopt event
motion priors to guide the optimization of the deformation fields. First, we
extract the motion priors encoded in event streams by using the proposed LoCM
unsupervised fine-tuning framework to adapt an event flow estimator to a
certain unseen scene. Then, we present the geometry-aware data association
method to build the event-Gaussian motion correspondence, which is the primary
foundation of the pipeline, accompanied by two useful strategies, namely motion
decomposition and inter-frame pseudo-label. Extensive experiments show that our
method outperforms existing image and event-based approaches across synthetic
and real scenes and prove that our method can effectively optimize dynamic 3DGS
with the help of event data.

Method: 使用BraTS2020数据集，评估UNet、ResUNet和AttUNet三种深度学习模型，采用Adam优化器训练，使用Grad-CAM和注意力可视化进行模型解释分析。

Result: ResUNet在最终测试阶段表现最佳，在Dice和Jaccard相似度得分以及准确率、召回率和F1分数方面均优于其他模型。

Abstract: The current study investigated the use of Explainable Artificial Intelligence
(XAI) to improve the accuracy of brain tumor segmentation in MRI images, with
the goal of assisting physicians in clinical decision-making. The study focused
on applying UNet models for brain tumor segmentation and using the XAI
techniques of Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and
attention-based visualization to enhance the understanding of these models.
Three deep learning models - UNet, Residual UNet (ResUNet), and Attention UNet
(AttUNet) - were evaluated to identify the best-performing model. XAI was
employed with the aims of clarifying model decisions and increasing physicians'
trust in these models. We compared the performance of two UNet variants
(ResUNet and AttUNet) with the conventional UNet in segmenting brain tumors
from the BraTS2020 public dataset and analyzed model predictions with Grad-CAM
and attention-based visualization. Using the latest computer hardware, we
trained and validated each model using the Adam optimizer and assessed their
performance with respect to: (i) training, validation, and inference times,
(ii) segmentation similarity coefficients and loss functions, and (iii)
classification performance. Notably, during the final testing phase, ResUNet
outperformed the other models with respect to Dice and Jaccard similarity
scores, as well as accuracy, recall, and F1 scores. Grad-CAM provided
visuospatial insights into the tumor subregions each UNet model focused on
while attention-based visualization provided valuable insights into the working
mechanisms of AttUNet's attention modules. These results demonstrated ResUNet
as the best-performing model and we conclude by recommending its use for
automated brain tumor segmentation in future clinical assessments. Our source

*Qinghongbing Xie,Zhaoyuan Xia,Feng Zhu,Lijun Gong,Ziyue Li,Rui Zhao,Long Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Geo-Temporal Reasoning benchmark (GTR-Bench)，用于评估视觉语言模型在地理时空推理方面的能力，特别是在大规模摄像头网络中追踪移动目标。该基准测试要求在多视角视频和地图之间进行切换推理，评估显示现有模型表现远低于人类水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时空基准主要关注自我中心视角的图像/视频推理或地理视角的图形推理，但缺乏同时结合图像/视频和图形上下文的地理时空智能评估，这对交通管理和应急响应等领域很重要。

Method: 构建GTR-Bench基准，要求模型在摄像头网络中追踪移动目标，进行多视角切换、跨视频联合推理，以及对未观测时空区域的推断。

Result: 评估10多个流行VLM，表现最好的Gemini-2.5-Pro仅达到34.9%，远低于人类表现的78.61%。分析发现模型存在时空上下文利用不平衡、时间预测能力弱、地图与视频理解对齐困难三大缺陷。

Conclusion: GTR-Bench为时空智能研究提供了有价值的见解和新机会，揭示了当前模型在地理时空推理方面的显著不足。

Abstract: Recently spatial-temporal intelligence of Visual-Language Models (VLMs) has
attracted much attention due to its importance for Autonomous Driving, Embodied
AI and General Artificial Intelligence. Existing spatial-temporal benchmarks
mainly focus on egocentric perspective reasoning with images/video context, or
geographic perspective reasoning with graphics context (eg. a map), thus fail
to assess VLMs' geographic spatial-temporal intelligence with both images/video
and graphics context, which is important for areas like traffic management and
emergency response. To address the gaps, we introduce Geo-Temporal Reasoning
benchmark (GTR-Bench), a novel challenge for geographic temporal reasoning of
moving targets in a large-scale camera network. GTR-Bench is more challenging
as it requires multiple perspective switches between maps and videos, joint
reasoning across multiple videos with non-overlapping fields of view, and
inference over spatial-temporal regions that are unobserved by any video
context. Evaluations of more than 10 popular VLMs on GTR-Bench demonstrate that
even the best proprietary model, Gemini-2.5-Pro (34.9%), significantly lags
behind human performance (78.61%) on geo-temporal reasoning. Moreover, our
comprehensive analysis on GTR-Bench reveals three primary deficiencies of
current models for geo-temporal reasoning. (1) VLMs' reasoning is impaired by
an imbalanced utilization of spatial-temporal context. (2) VLMs are weak in
temporal forecasting, which leads to worse performance on temporal-emphasized
tasks than on spatial-emphasized tasks. (3) VLMs lack the proficiency to
comprehend or align the map data with multi-view video inputs. We believe
GTR-Bench offers valuable insights and opens up new opportunities for research
and applications in spatial-temporal intelligence. Benchmark and code will be
released at https://github.com/X-Luffy/GTR-Bench.

Conclusion: 可学习的双阶段框架在推进微表情识别方面具有巨大潜力，通过全面捕捉微表情的完整动态过程能够显著提升识别性能。

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions, characterized by their subtle and brief nature, are
valuable indicators of genuine emotions. Despite their significance in
psychology, security, and behavioral analysis, micro-expression recognition
remains challenging due to the difficulty of capturing subtle facial movements.
Optical flow has been widely employed as an input modality for this task due to
its effectiveness. However, most existing methods compute optical flow only
between the onset and apex frames, thereby overlooking essential motion
information in the apex-to-offset phase. To address this limitation, we first
introduce a comprehensive motion representation, termed Magnitude-Modulated
Combined Optical Flow (MM-COF), which integrates motion dynamics from both
micro-expression phases into a unified descriptor suitable for direct use in
recognition networks. Building upon this principle, we then propose FMANet, a
novel end-to-end neural network architecture that internalizes the dual-phase
analysis and magnitude modulation into learnable modules. This allows the
network to adaptively fuse motion cues and focus on salient facial regions for
classification. Experimental evaluations on the MMEW, SMIC, CASME-II, and SAMM
datasets, widely recognized as standard benchmarks, demonstrate that our
proposed MM-COF representation and FMANet outperforms existing methods,
underscoring the potential of a learnable, dual-phase framework in advancing
micro-expression recognition.

Abstract: Predicting spherical pixel depth from monocular $360^{\circ}$ indoor
panoramas is critical for many vision applications. However, existing methods
focus on pixel-level accuracy, causing oversmoothed room corners and noise
sensitivity. In this paper, we propose a depth estimation framework based on
room geometry constraints, which extracts room geometry information through
layout prediction and integrates those information into the depth estimation
process through background segmentation mechanism. At the model level, our
framework comprises a shared feature encoder followed by task-specific decoders
for layout estimation, depth estimation, and background segmentation. The
shared encoder extracts multi-scale features, which are subsequently processed
by individual decoders to generate initial predictions: a depth map, a room
layout map, and a background segmentation map. Furthermore, our framework
incorporates two strategies: a room geometry-based background depth resolving
strategy and a background-segmentation-guided fusion mechanism. The proposed
room-geometry-based background depth resolving strategy leverages the room
layout and the depth decoder's output to generate the corresponding background
depth map. Then, a background-segmentation-guided fusion strategy derives
fusion weights for the background and coarse depth maps from the segmentation
decoder's predictions. Extensive experimental results on the Stanford2D3D,
Matterport3D and Structured3D datasets show that our proposed methods can
achieve significantly superior performance than current open-source methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉提示方法存在表达能力有限和容易过拟合的问题，导致准确率低于其他适应方法。

Method: 提出ACAVP方法，包含仿射变换（保留原始图像信息）、颜色变换（强调任务相关特征）和加法变换，并使用TrivialAugment数据增强来防止过拟合。

Result: 在12个图像分类数据集上，ACAVP在视觉提示方法中达到最先进准确率，平均准确率超过线性探测，对分布偏移具有更强鲁棒性，且推理时计算开销极小。

Conclusion: ACAVP通过增强变换操作和有效数据增强，显著提升了视觉提示的性能，证明了适当的数据增强对视觉提示训练具有普遍益处。

Abstract: Visual prompting (VP) has emerged as a promising parameter-efficient
fine-tuning approach for adapting pre-trained vision models to downstream tasks
without modifying model parameters. Despite offering advantages like negligible
computational overhead and compatibility with black-box models, conventional VP
methods typically achieve lower accuracy than other adaptation approaches. Our
analysis reveals two critical limitations: the restricted expressivity of
simple additive transformation and a tendency toward overfitting when the
parameter count increases. To address these challenges, we propose ACAVP
(Affine, Color, and Additive Visual Prompting), which enhances VP's expressive
power by introducing complementary transformation operations: affine
transformation for creating task-specific prompt regions while preserving
original image information, and color transformation for emphasizing
task-relevant visual features. Additionally, we identify that overfitting is a
critical issue in VP training and introduce TrivialAugment as an effective data
augmentation, which not only benefits our approach but also significantly
improves existing VP methods, with performance gains of up to 12 percentage
points on certain datasets. This demonstrates that appropriate data
augmentation is universally beneficial for VP training. Extensive experiments
across twelve diverse image classification datasets with two different model
architectures demonstrate that ACAVP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among
VP methods, surpasses linear probing in average accuracy, and exhibits superior
robustness to distribution shifts, all while maintaining minimal computational
overhead during inference.

Conclusion: MMHOI数据集和MMHOI-Net框架为下一代HOI研究提供了全面的测试平台，能够有效处理复杂多人物多物体交互场景。

Abstract: Real-world scenes often feature multiple humans interacting with multiple
objects in ways that are causal, goal-oriented, or cooperative. Yet existing 3D
human-object interaction (HOI) benchmarks consider only a fraction of these
complex interactions. To close this gap, we present MMHOI -- a large-scale,
Multi-human Multi-object Interaction dataset consisting of images from 12
everyday scenarios. MMHOI offers complete 3D shape and pose annotations for
every person and object, along with labels for 78 action categories and 14
interaction-specific body parts, providing a comprehensive testbed for
next-generation HOI research. Building on MMHOI, we present MMHOI-Net, an
end-to-end transformer-based neural network for jointly estimating human-object
3D geometries, their interactions, and associated actions. A key innovation in
our framework is a structured dual-patch representation for modeling objects
and their interactions, combined with action recognition to enhance the
interaction prediction. Experiments on MMHOI and the recently proposed CORE4D
datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in
multi-HOI modeling, excelling in both accuracy and reconstruction quality.

Motivation: 3D高斯溅射在紧凑场景中实现了实时逼真渲染，但在大规模城市场景中会出现严重的走样伪影和优化不稳定问题，特别是在高分辨率渲染下。现有方法虽然解决了可扩展性，但未能解决这种保真度差距。

Method: PrismGS集成了两个协同的正则化器：金字塔多尺度监督（通过预滤波图像金字塔监督渲染一致性）和显式尺寸正则化（对3D高斯尺寸施加物理基础的下界约束）。

Result: 在MatrixCity、Mill-19和UrbanScene3D数据集上的实验表明，PrismGS实现了最先进的性能，相比CityGaussian获得了约1.5 dB的PSNR增益，同时在4K渲染下保持了优越的质量和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PrismGS是一个即插即用的框架，与现有流水线兼容，能够有效解决大规模城市场景中3D高斯溅射的走样问题，提升渲染质量和稳定性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently enabled real-time photorealistic
rendering in compact scenes, but scaling to large urban environments introduces
severe aliasing artifacts and optimization instability, especially under
high-resolution (e.g., 4K) rendering. These artifacts, manifesting as
flickering textures and jagged edges, arise from the mismatch between Gaussian
primitives and the multi-scale nature of urban geometry. While existing
``divide-and-conquer'' pipelines address scalability, they fail to resolve this
fidelity gap. In this paper, we propose PrismGS, a physically-grounded
regularization framework that improves the intrinsic rendering behavior of 3D
Gaussians. PrismGS integrates two synergistic regularizers. The first is
pyramidal multi-scale supervision, which enforces consistency by supervising
the rendering against a pre-filtered image pyramid. This compels the model to
learn an inherently anti-aliased representation that remains coherent across
different viewing scales, directly mitigating flickering textures. This is
complemented by an explicit size regularization that imposes a
physically-grounded lower bound on the dimensions of the 3D Gaussians. This
prevents the formation of degenerate, view-dependent primitives, leading to
more stable and plausible geometric surfaces and reducing jagged edges. Our
method is plug-and-play and compatible with existing pipelines. Extensive
experiments on MatrixCity, Mill-19, and UrbanScene3D demonstrate that PrismGS
achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding significant PSNR gains around
1.5 dB against CityGaussian, while maintaining its superior quality and
robustness under demanding 4K rendering.

Motivation: 随着增强现实、虚拟现实和机器人应用对语义丰富的3D室内场景模型需求增长，从稀疏视图创建这些模型仍面临几何模糊的挑战。现有方法通常将语义视为被动特征，而本文认为语义理解应作为主动引导力量来增强稀疏视图重建的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 结果表明，将语义先验作为几何正则化器能够从有限的输入视图中产生更连贯和完整的3D模型。

Abstract: The demand for semantically rich 3D models of indoor scenes is rapidly
growing, driven by applications in augmented reality, virtual reality, and
robotics. However, creating them from sparse views remains a challenge due to
geometric ambiguity. Existing methods often treat semantics as a passive
feature painted on an already-formed, and potentially flawed, geometry. We
posit that for robust sparse-view reconstruction, semantic understanding
instead be an active, guiding force. This paper introduces AlignGS, a novel
framework that actualizes this vision by pioneering a synergistic, end-to-end
optimization of geometry and semantics. Our method distills rich priors from 2D
foundation models and uses them to directly regularize the 3D representation
through a set of novel semantic-to-geometry guidance mechanisms, including
depth consistency and multi-faceted normal regularization. Extensive
evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis and produces reconstructions
with superior geometric accuracy. The results validate that leveraging semantic
priors as a geometric regularizer leads to more coherent and complete 3D models
from limited input views. Our code is avaliable at

Motivation: 现有feedforward重建范式在驾驶场景重建中存在两个主要问题：固定视角变换在相机配置改变时失效，限制了跨不同驾驶场景的泛化能力；稀疏全景视图间重叠区域小且驾驶场景复杂，增加了学习难度，降低了重建精度。

Conclusion: XYZCylinder通过统一的圆柱体提升方法有效解决了驾驶场景重建中的泛化能力和精度问题，展示了优异的跨场景适应能力。

Abstract: Recently, more attention has been paid to feedforward reconstruction
paradigms, which mainly learn a fixed view transformation implicitly and
reconstruct the scene with a single representation. However, their
generalization capability and reconstruction accuracy are still limited while
reconstructing driving scenes, which results from two aspects: (1) The fixed
view transformation fails when the camera configuration changes, limiting the
generalization capability across different driving scenes equipped with
different camera configurations. (2) The small overlapping regions between
sparse views of the $360^\circ$ panorama and the complexity of driving scenes
increase the learning difficulty, reducing the reconstruction accuracy. To
handle these difficulties, we propose \textbf{XYZCylinder}, a feedforward model
based on a unified cylinder lifting method which involves camera modeling and
feature lifting. Specifically, to improve the generalization capability, we
design a Unified Cylinder Camera Modeling (UCCM) strategy, which avoids the
learning of viewpoint-dependent spatial correspondence and unifies different
camera configurations with adjustable parameters. To improve the reconstruction
accuracy, we propose a hybrid representation with several dedicated modules
based on newly designed Cylinder Plane Feature Group (CPFG) to lift 2D image
features to 3D space. Experimental results show that XYZCylinder achieves
state-of-the-art performance under different evaluation settings, and can be
generalized to other driving scenes in a zero-shot manner. Project page:

Abstract: The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has laid the foundation
for multimodal models. However, visual language models (VLMs) still face heavy
computational costs when extended from images to videos due to high frame rates
and long durations. Token compression is a promising solution, yet most
existing training-free methods cause information loss and performance
degradation. To overcome this, we propose \textbf{Memory-Augmented
Reinforcement Learning-based Token Compression (MARC)}, which integrates
structured retrieval and RL-based distillation. MARC adopts a
\textit{retrieve-then-compress} strategy using a \textbf{Visual Memory

Result: 通过广泛实验，ASBench不仅揭示了当前异常合成方法的局限性，还为异常合成的未来研究方向提供了可行的见解。

Conclusion: ASBench填补了异常合成方法系统评估的空白，为异常检测领域提供了重要的基准工具，推动了异常合成研究的进一步发展。

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in manufacturing quality control, yet
its application is constrained by limited abnormal samples and high manual
annotation costs. While anomaly synthesis offers a promising solution, existing
studies predominantly treat anomaly synthesis as an auxiliary component within
anomaly detection frameworks, lacking systematic evaluation of anomaly
synthesis algorithms. Current research also overlook crucial factors specific
to anomaly synthesis, such as decoupling its impact from detection,
quantitative analysis of synthetic data and adaptability across different
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose ASBench, the first
comprehensive benchmarking framework dedicated to evaluating anomaly synthesis
methods. Our framework introduces four critical evaluation dimensions: (i) the
generalization performance across different datasets and pipelines (ii) the
ratio of synthetic to real data (iii) the correlation between intrinsic metrics
of synthesis images and anomaly detection performance metrics , and (iv)
strategies for hybrid anomaly synthesis methods. Through extensive experiments,
ASBench not only reveals limitations in current anomaly synthesis methods but
also provides actionable insights for future research directions in anomaly
synthesis

TL;DR: TTOM是一个无需训练的视频生成框架，通过测试时优化和记忆机制来改善视频基础模型在组合场景下的表现，实现更好的文本-图像对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频基础模型在视觉生成方面表现出色，但在组合场景（如运动、数量和空间关系）中表现不佳，需要改进文本-图像对齐能力。

Method: 提出TTOM框架：1）在推理时基于时空布局优化新参数；2）采用流式视频生成设置；3）使用参数化记忆机制维护历史优化上下文，支持插入、读取、更新和删除操作。

Result: 在T2V-CompBench和Vbench基准测试中，TTOM被证明是有效、实用、可扩展且高效的框架，能够实现组合视频生成的跨模态对齐。

Conclusion: TTOM能够解耦组合性世界知识，展现出强大的可迁移性和泛化能力，为组合视频生成提供了一种无需训练的在线对齐解决方案。

Abstract: Video Foundation Models (VFMs) exhibit remarkable visual generation
performance, but struggle in compositional scenarios (e.g., motion, numeracy,
and spatial relation). In this work, we introduce Test-Time Optimization and
Memorization (TTOM), a training-free framework that aligns VFM outputs with
spatiotemporal layouts during inference for better text-image alignment. Rather
than direct intervention to latents or attention per-sample in existing work,
we integrate and optimize new parameters guided by a general layout-attention
objective. Furthermore, we formulate video generation within a streaming
setting, and maintain historical optimization contexts with a parametric memory
mechanism that supports flexible operations, such as insert, read, update, and
delete. Notably, we found that TTOM disentangles compositional world knowledge,
showing powerful transferability and generalization. Experimental results on
the T2V-CompBench and Vbench benchmarks establish TTOM as an effective,
practical, scalable, and efficient framework to achieve cross-modal alignment
for compositional video generation on the fly.

Abstract: Generative models have been widely applied to world modeling for environment
simulation and future state prediction. With advancements in autonomous
driving, there is a growing demand not only for high-fidelity video generation
under various controls, but also for producing diverse and meaningful
information such as depth estimation. To address this, we propose CVD-STORM, a
cross-view video diffusion model utilizing a spatial-temporal reconstruction
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that generates long-term, multi-view videos with
4D reconstruction capabilities under various control inputs. Our approach first
fine-tunes the VAE with an auxiliary 4D reconstruction task, enhancing its
ability to encode 3D structures and temporal dynamics. Subsequently, we
integrate this VAE into the video diffusion process to significantly improve
generation quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves
substantial improvements in both FID and FVD metrics. Additionally, the
jointly-trained Gaussian Splatting Decoder effectively reconstructs dynamic
scenes, providing valuable geometric information for comprehensive scene
understanding.

TL;DR: 提出了Gaze on the Prize框架，通过可学习的中央凹注意力机制来提升视觉强化学习的样本效率，利用回报差异指导注意力关注任务相关特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉强化学习代理需要从高维图像数据中学习，但只有少量像素与任务相关，导致探索和计算资源浪费在无关特征上，造成样本效率低下和学习不稳定。

Method: 引入可学习的中央凹注意力机制，通过基于回报差异的自监督信号进行指导。使用回报引导的对比学习训练注意力，将相似视觉表征根据回报差异分为正负样本，构建对比三元组来训练注意力机制。

Result: 在ManiSkill3基准测试的多个操作任务中，样本效率提升最高达2.4倍，能够解决基线方法无法学习的任务，且无需修改底层算法或超参数。

Conclusion: 通过回报差异指导的注意力机制能够有效识别任务相关特征，显著提升视觉强化学习的样本效率和性能。

Abstract: Visual Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents must learn to act based on
high-dimensional image data where only a small fraction of the pixels is
task-relevant. This forces agents to waste exploration and computational
resources on irrelevant features, leading to sample-inefficient and unstable
learning. To address this, inspired by human visual foveation, we introduce
Gaze on the Prize. This framework augments visual RL with a learnable foveal
attention mechanism (Gaze), guided by a self-supervised signal derived from the
agent's experience pursuing higher returns (the Prize). Our key insight is that
return differences reveal what matters most: If two similar representations
produce different outcomes, their distinguishing features are likely
task-relevant, and the gaze should focus on them accordingly. This is realized
through return-guided contrastive learning that trains the attention to
distinguish between the features relevant to success and failure. We group
similar visual representations into positives and negatives based on their
return differences and use the resulting labels to construct contrastive
triplets. These triplets provide the training signal that teaches the attention
mechanism to produce distinguishable representations for states associated with
different outcomes. Our method achieves up to 2.4x improvement in sample
efficiency and can solve tasks that the baseline fails to learn, demonstrated
across a suite of manipulation tasks from the ManiSkill3 benchmark, all without
modifying the underlying algorithm or hyperparameters.

Motivation: 现有文本检测数据集主要针对自然或文档场景，文本通常具有规则字体、单调颜色和有序布局。而动漫场景中的文本风格多样、排列不规则，容易被复杂视觉元素混淆，包括大量手写和风格化字体。

Method: 构建大规模动漫文本数据集AnimeText，包含分层标注和针对动漫场景的硬负样本。

Abstract: Current text detection datasets primarily target natural or document scenes,
where text typically appear in regular font and shapes, monotonous colors, and
orderly layouts. The text usually arranged along straight or curved lines.
However, these characteristics differ significantly from anime scenes, where
text is often diverse in style, irregularly arranged, and easily confused with
complex visual elements such as symbols and decorative patterns. Text in anime
scene also includes a large number of handwritten and stylized fonts. Motivated
by this gap, we introduce AnimeText, a large-scale dataset containing 735K
images and 4.2M annotated text blocks. It features hierarchical annotations and
hard negative samples tailored for anime scenarios. %Cross-dataset evaluations
using state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that models trained on AnimeText
achieve superior performance in anime text detection tasks compared to existing
datasets. To evaluate the robustness of AnimeText in complex anime scenes, we
conducted cross-dataset benchmarking using state-of-the-art text detection
methods. Experimental results demonstrate that models trained on AnimeText
outperform those trained on existing datasets in anime scene text detection
tasks. AnimeText on HuggingFace:

Conclusion: 该框架为带宽受限环境下的3D点云传输提供了高效解决方案，在保持数据质量的同时显著减少传输需求，支持实际机器人应用。

Abstract: Efficient transmission of 3D point cloud data is critical for advanced
perception in centralized and decentralized multi-agent robotic systems,
especially nowadays with the growing reliance on edge and cloud-based
processing. However, the large and complex nature of point clouds creates
challenges under bandwidth constraints and intermittent connectivity, often
degrading system performance. We propose a deep compression framework based on
semantic scene graphs. The method decomposes point clouds into semantically
coherent patches and encodes them into compact latent representations with
semantic-aware encoders conditioned by Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). A
folding-based decoder, guided by latent features and graph node attributes,
enables structurally accurate reconstruction. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI
and nuScenes datasets show that the framework achieves state-of-the-art
compression rates, reducing data size by up to 98% while preserving both
structural and semantic fidelity. In addition, it supports downstream
applications such as multi-robot pose graph optimization and map merging,
achieving trajectory accuracy and map alignment comparable to those obtained
with raw LiDAR scans.

Conclusion: 提出的SimCast和CasCast框架能够在不增加推理开销的情况下获得改进的临近预报预测，结合了确定性和概率模型的优势，在多个数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting predicts future radar sequences based on current
observations, which is a highly challenging task driven by the inherent
complexity of the Earth system. Accurate nowcasting is of utmost importance for
addressing various societal needs, including disaster management, agriculture,
transportation, and energy optimization. As a complementary to existing
non-autoregressive nowcasting approaches, we investigate the impact of
prediction horizons on nowcasting models and propose SimCast, a novel training
pipeline featuring a short-to-long term knowledge distillation technique
coupled with a weighted MSE loss to prioritize heavy rainfall regions. Improved
nowcasting predictions can be obtained without introducing additional overhead
during inference. As SimCast generates deterministic predictions, we further
integrate it into a diffusion-based framework named CasCast, leveraging the
strengths from probabilistic models to overcome limitations such as blurriness
and distribution shift in deterministic outputs. Extensive experimental results
on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework, achieving mean CSI scores of 0.452 on SEVIR, 0.474 on HKO-7, and
0.361 on MeteoNet, which outperforms existing approaches by a significant

TL;DR: Memoir提出了一种基于想象力的记忆检索方法，用于视觉语言导航任务，通过世界模型想象未来状态作为查询，选择性检索相关环境观察和行为历史，显著提升了导航性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有记忆持久性视觉语言导航方法存在两个关键限制：缺乏有效的记忆访问机制，以及主要存储环境观察而忽略了编码有价值决策策略的导航行为模式。

Method: 1) 语言条件世界模型想象未来状态，用于编码经验和生成检索查询；2) 混合视角级记忆，将观察和行为模式锚定到视角，实现混合检索；3) 经验增强导航模型，通过专用编码器整合检索知识。

Result: 在10个不同测试场景的多样化记忆持久性VLN基准测试中，Memoir在所有场景均取得显著改进：在IR2R上比最佳记忆持久性基线提升5.4% SPL，同时实现8.3倍训练加速和74%推理内存减少。

Conclusion: 预测性检索环境和行为记忆能够实现更有效的导航，分析表明这种想象力引导范式仍有很大提升空间（73.3% vs 93.4%上限）。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to follow natural
language instructions through environments, with memory-persistent variants
demanding progressive improvement through accumulated experience. Existing
approaches for memory-persistent VLN face critical limitations: they lack
effective memory access mechanisms, instead relying on entire memory
incorporation or fixed-horizon lookup, and predominantly store only
environmental observations while neglecting navigation behavioral patterns that
encode valuable decision-making strategies. We present Memoir, which employs
imagination as a retrieval mechanism grounded by explicit memory: a world model
imagines future navigation states as queries to selectively retrieve relevant
environmental observations and behavioral histories. The approach comprises: 1)
a language-conditioned world model that imagines future states serving dual
purposes: encoding experiences for storage and generating retrieval queries; 2)
Hybrid Viewpoint-Level Memory that anchors both observations and behavioral
patterns to viewpoints, enabling hybrid retrieval; and 3) an
experience-augmented navigation model that integrates retrieved knowledge
through specialized encoders. Extensive evaluation across diverse
memory-persistent VLN benchmarks with 10 distinctive testing scenarios
demonstrates Memoir's effectiveness: significant improvements across all
scenarios, with 5.4% SPL gains on IR2R over the best memory-persistent
baseline, accompanied by 8.3x training speedup and 74% inference memory
reduction. The results validate that predictive retrieval of both environmental
and behavioral memories enables more effective navigation, with analysis
indicating substantial headroom (73.3% vs 93.4% upper bound) for this
imagination-guided paradigm. Code at https://github.com/xyz9911/Memoir.

TL;DR: Latent Harmony是一个两阶段UHD图像修复框架，通过联合正则化潜在空间和强制高频感知重建，在计算效率和细节保留之间取得平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决UHD图像修复中计算效率与高频细节保留的权衡问题，传统VAE的高斯约束会丢失退化特定的高频信息，影响重建保真度。

Method: 第一阶段：LH-VAE通过视觉语义约束和渐进退化扰动增强语义鲁棒性，潜在等变性强化高频重建。第二阶段：使用HF-LoRA联合训练，包含编码器LoRA（保真度导向的高频对齐损失）和解码器LoRA（感知导向的损失），通过交替优化和选择性梯度传播保持预训练潜在结构。

Result: 在UHD和标准分辨率任务上达到最先进性能，有效平衡效率、感知质量和重建精度。

Conclusion: Latent Harmony通过重新定义VAE用于UHD修复，成功解决了计算效率与高频细节保留的权衡问题，实现了灵活的可调保真度-感知权衡。

Abstract: Ultra-High Definition (UHD) image restoration faces a trade-off between
computational efficiency and high-frequency detail retention. While Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) improve efficiency via latent-space processing, their
Gaussian constraint often discards degradation-specific high-frequency
information, hurting reconstruction fidelity. To overcome this, we propose
Latent Harmony, a two-stage framework that redefines VAEs for UHD restoration
by jointly regularizing the latent space and enforcing high-frequency-aware
reconstruction.In Stage One, we introduce LH-VAE, which enhances semantic
robustness through visual semantic constraints and progressive degradation
perturbations, while latent equivariance strengthens high-frequency
reconstruction.Stage Two jointly trains this refined VAE with a restoration
model using High-Frequency Low-Rank Adaptation (HF-LoRA): an encoder LoRA
guided by a fidelity-oriented high-frequency alignment loss to recover
authentic details, and a decoder LoRA driven by a perception-oriented loss to
synthesize realistic textures. Both LoRA modules are trained via alternating
optimization with selective gradient propagation to preserve the pretrained
latent structure.At inference, a tunable parameter {\alpha} enables flexible
fidelity-perception trade-offs.Experiments show Latent Harmony achieves
state-of-the-art performance across UHD and standard-resolution tasks,
effectively balancing efficiency, perceptual quality, and reconstruction
accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ResAD框架，通过归一化残差轨迹建模解决端到端自动驾驶中的时空不平衡问题，将学习任务重构为预测与确定性惯性参考的偏差，而非直接预测未来轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端自动驾驶系统面临轨迹数据固有的时空不平衡问题，这导致模型学习虚假相关性而非因果推理，同时优先考虑不确定的远距离预测而损害即时安全性。

Method: ResAD框架将学习任务重构为预测与确定性惯性参考的残差偏差，而非直接预测未来轨迹。惯性参考作为反事实，迫使模型识别导致偏离默认惯性路径的因果因素。此外，通过点归一化对预测残差进行重加权，防止远距离不确定路径点的大幅度误差主导学习信号。

Result: 在NAVSIM基准测试中，ResAD使用仅有两个去噪步骤的普通扩散策略实现了88.6的最优PDMS，表明该方法显著简化了学习任务并提高了模型性能。

Conclusion: ResAD框架通过归一化残差轨迹建模有效解决了端到端自动驾驶中的时空不平衡问题，简化了学习任务并显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD) systems, which learn to predict future
trajectories directly from sensor data, are fundamentally challenged by the
inherent spatio-temporal imbalance of trajectory data. This imbalance creates a
significant optimization burden, causing models to learn spurious correlations
instead of causal inference, while also prioritizing uncertain, distant
predictions, thereby compromising immediate safety. To address these issues, we
propose ResAD, a novel Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling framework.
Instead of predicting the future trajectory directly, our approach reframes the
learning task to predict the residual deviation from a deterministic inertial
reference. The inertial reference serves as a counterfactual, forcing the model
to move beyond simple pattern recognition and instead identify the underlying
causal factors (e.g., traffic rules, obstacles) that necessitate deviations
from a default, inertially-guided path. To deal with the optimization imbalance
caused by uncertain, long-term horizons, ResAD further incorporates Point-wise
Normalization of the predicted residual. It re-weights the optimization
objective, preventing large-magnitude errors associated with distant, uncertain
waypoints from dominating the learning signal. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of our framework. On the NAVSIM benchmark, ResAD achieves a
state-of-the-art PDMS of 88.6 using a vanilla diffusion policy with only two
denoising steps, demonstrating that our approach significantly simplifies the
learning task and improves model performance. The code will be released to
facilitate further research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对象标签表示具体实体，适用于许多计算机视觉任务，而抽象标签捕捉更高层次的信息，适合需要上下文和主观场景理解的任务。本文旨在探索哪种类型的标签更适合图像隐私这一上下文依赖且主观的任务。

Method: 通过比较对象标签和抽象标签在图像隐私分类中的表现，分析在不同标签数量限制下的效果差异。

Result: 当标签预算有限时，抽象标签比对象标签更有效；但当每个图像可获得更多标签时，对象相关信息同样有用。

Conclusion: 这些发现将指导未来研究开发更准确的图像隐私分类器，考虑标签类型和数量的作用。

Abstract: Object tags denote concrete entities and are central to many computer vision
tasks, whereas abstract tags capture higher-level information, which is
relevant for tasks that require a contextual, potentially subjective scene
understanding. Object and abstract tags extracted from images also facilitate
interpretability. In this paper, we explore which type of tags is more suitable
for the context-dependent and inherently subjective task of image privacy.
While object tags are generally used for privacy classification, we show that
abstract tags are more effective when the tag budget is limited. Conversely,
when a larger number of tags per image is available, object-related information
is as useful. We believe that these findings will guide future research in
developing more accurate image privacy classifiers, informed by the role of tag
types and quantity.

Motivation: 研究高性能Transformer模型与轻量级CNN在低光图像恢复任务中的性能-效率权衡，探索在资源受限的实际应用中更实用的解决方案。

Method: 对比实验方法，将最先进的SwinIR Transformer模型与标准轻量级CNN在相同的低光图像恢复任务上进行性能与效率的全面比较。

Result: SwinIR获得更高的峰值性能(PSNR 39.03 dB)，但CNN表现接近(PSNR 37.4 dB)。CNN仅需10个训练周期收敛，而SwinIR需要132个周期，且CNN模型大小比SwinIR小55倍以上。

Conclusion: 标准CNN能够在显著降低计算开销的情况下提供接近最先进的性能，在资源受限的实际应用场景中具有更强的实用性。

Abstract: The simultaneous restoration of high-frequency details and suppression of
severe noise in low-light imagery presents a significant and persistent
challenge in computer vision. While large-scale Transformer models like SwinIR
have set the state of the art in performance, their high computational cost can
be a barrier for practical applications. This paper investigates the critical
trade-off between performance and efficiency by comparing the state-of-the-art
SwinIR model against a standard, lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
on this challenging task. Our experimental results reveal a nuanced but
important finding. While the Transformer-based SwinIR model achieves a higher
peak performance, with a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 39.03 dB, the
lightweight CNN delivers a surprisingly competitive PSNR of 37.4 dB. Crucially,
the CNN reached this performance after converging in only 10 epochs of
training, whereas the more complex SwinIR model required 132 epochs. This
efficiency is further underscored by the model's size; the CNN is over 55 times
smaller than SwinIR. This work demonstrates that a standard CNN can provide a
near state-of-the-art result with significantly lower computational overhead,
presenting a compelling case for its use in real-world scenarios where resource
constraints are a primary concern.

Abstract: Human Pose Estimation is a crucial module in human-machine interaction
applications and, especially since the rise in deep learning technology, robust
methods are available to consumers using RGB cameras and commercial GPUs. On
the other hand, event-based cameras have gained popularity in the vision
research community for their low latency and low energy advantages that make
them ideal for applications where those resources are constrained like portable
electronics and mobile robots. In this work we propose a Graph Neural Network,
GraphEnet, that leverages the sparse nature of event camera output, with an
intermediate line based event representation, to estimate 2D Human Pose of a
single person at a high frequency. The architecture incorporates a novel offset
vector learning paradigm with confidence based pooling to estimate the human
pose. This is the first work that applies Graph Neural Networks to event data
for Human Pose Estimation. The code is open-source at

Motivation: 现有的组合图像检索方法主要基于视觉语言模型和多模态大语言模型，但这些模型作为"黑盒"存在，用户无法理解检索原理，且难以遵循复杂的细粒度指令。

Method: 提出CIR-CoT模型，强制模型先生成可解释的推理链，然后生成专门的检索嵌入。通过三阶段过程创建结构化思维链标注，包括描述、推理和结论。

Result: CIR-CoT在领域内数据集（FashionIQ、CIRR）上取得高度竞争力表现，并在领域外CIRCO数据集上展现出卓越的泛化能力。

Conclusion: CIR-CoT为构建更有效和可信赖的检索系统开辟了新路径，通过显式推理链提高了检索准确性和透明度。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR), which aims to find a target image from a
reference image and a modification text, presents the core challenge of
performing unified reasoning across visual and semantic modalities. While
current approaches based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs, e.g., CLIP) and more
recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs, e.g., Qwen-VL) have shown
progress, they predominantly function as ``black boxes." This inherent opacity
not only prevents users from understanding the retrieval rationale but also
restricts the models' ability to follow complex, fine-grained instructions. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce CIR-CoT, the first end-to-end
retrieval-oriented MLLM designed to integrate explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning. By compelling the model to first generate an interpretable reasoning
chain, CIR-CoT enhances its ability to capture crucial cross-modal
interactions, leading to more accurate retrieval while making its decision
process transparent. Since existing datasets like FashionIQ and CIRR lack the
necessary reasoning data, a key contribution of our work is the creation of
structured CoT annotations using a three-stage process involving a caption,
reasoning, and conclusion. Our model is then fine-tuned to produce this
structured output before encoding its final retrieval intent into a dedicated
embedding. Comprehensive experiments show that CIR-CoT achieves highly
competitive performance on in-domain datasets (FashionIQ, CIRR) and
demonstrates remarkable generalization on the out-of-domain CIRCO dataset,
establishing a new path toward more effective and trustworthy retrieval
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于相机的协作感知系统中由于缺乏显式深度信息而难以生成准确3D目标检测预测的问题。

Method: 利用协作车辆的射线占用信息，减少相机射线上的冗余和误报预测。

Result: 综合实验表明该方法持续优于现有最先进模型，显著提升了协作视觉感知性能。

Conclusion: RayFusion通过射线融合有效缓解了深度估计模糊性，推进了纯相机协作感知系统的发展。

Abstract: Collaborative visual perception methods have gained widespread attention in
the autonomous driving community in recent years due to their ability to
address sensor limitation problems. However, the absence of explicit depth
information often makes it difficult for camera-based perception systems, e.g.,
3D object detection, to generate accurate predictions. To alleviate the
ambiguity in depth estimation, we propose RayFusion, a ray-based fusion method
for collaborative visual perception. Using ray occupancy information from
collaborators, RayFusion reduces redundancy and false positive predictions
along camera rays, enhancing the detection performance of purely camera-based
collaborative perception systems. Comprehensive experiments show that our
method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, substantially
advancing the performance of collaborative visual perception. The code is
available at https://github.com/wangsh0111/RayFusion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决脑MRI扫描中精确像素级标注不可用、只有弱标签（如切片级）可用时的异常检测挑战，需要快速准确的脑异常检测方法。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用判别性双提示调优机制生成高质量伪弱掩码；第二阶段使用带有区域感知空间注意力机制的分割网络，依赖基于位置的随机嵌入来聚焦异常区域。

Result: 在BraTS20、BraTS21、BraTS23和MSD数据集上实现显著性能提升，同时大幅降低计算复杂度，参数少于800万。

Conclusion: RASALoRE在弱监督异常检测中表现出色，显著优于现有方法，为脑MRI异常检测提供了高效准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Anomaly detection (WSAD) in brain MRI scans is an important
challenge useful to obtain quick and accurate detection of brain anomalies when
precise pixel-level anomaly annotations are unavailable and only weak labels
(e.g., slice-level) are available. In this work, we propose RASALoRE: Region
Aware Spatial Attention with Location-based Random Embeddings, a novel
two-stage WSAD framework. In the first stage, we introduce a Discriminative
Dual Prompt Tuning (DDPT) mechanism that generates high-quality pseudo weak
masks based on slice-level labels, serving as coarse localization cues. In the
second stage, we propose a segmentation network with a region-aware spatial
attention mechanism that relies on fixed location-based random embeddings. This
design enables the model to effectively focus on anomalous regions. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art anomaly detection performance, significantly
outperforming existing WSAD methods while utilizing less than 8 million
parameters. Extensive evaluations on the BraTS20, BraTS21, BraTS23, and MSD
datasets demonstrate a substantial performance improvement coupled with a
significant reduction in computational complexity. Code is available at:

TL;DR: RetouchLLM是一个无需训练的白盒图像润色系统，通过代码生成实现可解释的高分辨率图像润色，模仿人类多步骤润色过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习方法需要大规模配对数据且作为黑盒运行，润色过程不透明，难以处理多样化的用户或图像特定调整。

Method: 包含视觉评论家模块识别输入与参考图像差异，代码生成器模块生成可执行代码，以多步骤方式渐进增强图像。

Result: 实验表明该方法能很好泛化到不同润色风格，基于自然语言的用户交互实现了可解释和可控的调整。

Conclusion: RetouchLLM提供了一种无需训练数据、可解释的白盒图像润色方案，支持多样化的调整路径和用户定制化控制。

Abstract: Image retouching not only enhances visual quality but also serves as a means
of expressing personal preferences and emotions. However, existing
learning-based approaches require large-scale paired data and operate as black
boxes, making the retouching process opaque and limiting their adaptability to
handle diverse, user- or image-specific adjustments. In this work, we propose
RetouchLLM, a training-free white-box image retouching system, which requires
no training data and performs interpretable, code-based retouching directly on
high-resolution images. Our framework progressively enhances the image in a
manner similar to how humans perform multi-step retouching, allowing
exploration of diverse adjustment paths. It comprises of two main modules: a
visual critic that identifies differences between the input and reference
images, and a code generator that produces executable codes. Experiments
demonstrate that our approach generalizes well across diverse retouching
styles, while natural language-based user interaction enables interpretable and
controllable adjustments tailored to user intent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决多光谱图像时间序列分类中不同语义级别类别的区分问题，并利用有限的训练样本有效训练模型，同时提高对少数类别的表示能力。

Method: 修改ResNet架构，引入额外分支在不同层次级别进行分类，使用分层惩罚映射来避免不一致的分层转换，通过类层次标签高效训练不同层。

Result: 在2019年Sentinel 2图像的12个月度合成数据上实验表明，该方法在不同层次级别具有良好泛化能力，在微类级别实现了准确分类，并更好地表示了少数类别。

Conclusion: 提出的模块化网络具有内在适应能力，通过分层方法有效提高了分类性能，特别是在新目标区域的微类级别分类和少数类别表示方面表现优异。

Abstract: This work presents a multitemporal class-driven hierarchical Residual Neural
Network (ResNet) designed for modelling the classification of Time Series (TS)
of multispectral images at different semantical class levels. The architecture
consists of a modification of the ResNet where we introduce additional branches
to perform the classification at the different hierarchy levels and leverage on
hierarchy-penalty maps to discourage incoherent hierarchical transitions within
the classification. In this way, we improve the discrimination capabilities of
classes at different levels of semantic details and train a modular
architecture that can be used as a backbone network for introducing new
specific classes and additional tasks considering limited training samples
available. We exploit the class-hierarchy labels to train efficiently the
different layers of the architecture, allowing the first layers to train faster
on the first levels of the hierarchy modeling general classes (i.e., the
macro-classes) and the intermediate classes, while using the last ones to
discriminate more specific classes (i.e., the micro-classes). In this way, the
targets are constrained in following the hierarchy defined, improving the
classification of classes at the most detailed level. The proposed modular
network has intrinsic adaptation capability that can be obtained through fine
tuning. The experimental results, obtained on two tiles of the Amazonian Forest
on 12 monthly composites of Sentinel 2 images acquired during 2019, demonstrate
the effectiveness of the hierarchical approach in both generalizing over
different hierarchical levels and learning discriminant features for an
accurate classification at the micro-class level on a new target area, with a
better representation of the minoritarian classes.

Conclusion: RedFace数据集填补了学术评估与现实需求之间的差距，为开发更有效的深度伪造检测方法提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Deepfakes, leveraging advanced AIGC (Artificial Intelligence-Generated
Content) techniques, create hyper-realistic synthetic images and videos of
human faces, posing a significant threat to the authenticity of social media.
While this real-world threat is increasingly prevalent, existing academic
evaluations and benchmarks for detecting deepfake forgery often fall short to
achieve effective application for their lack of specificity, limited deepfake
diversity, restricted manipulation techniques.To address these limitations, we
introduce RedFace (Real-world-oriented Deepfake Face), a specialized facial
deepfake dataset, comprising over 60,000 forged images and 1,000 manipulated
videos derived from authentic facial features, to bridge the gap between
academic evaluations and real-world necessity. Unlike prior benchmarks, which
typically rely on academic methods to generate deepfakes, RedFace utilizes 9
commercial online platforms to integrate the latest deepfake technologies found
"in the wild", effectively simulating real-world black-box scenarios.Moreover,
RedFace's deepfakes are synthesized using bespoke algorithms, allowing it to
capture diverse and evolving methods used by real-world deepfake creators.
Extensive experimental results on RedFace (including cross-domain,
intra-domain, and real-world social network dissemination simulations) verify
the limited practicality of existing deepfake detection schemes against
real-world applications. We further perform a detailed analysis of the RedFace
dataset, elucidating the reason of its impact on detection performance compared
to conventional datasets. Our dataset is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成视频（如Sora）已达到近乎完美的视觉真实感，迫切需要可靠的检测机制，但现有方法在建模高维时空动态和识别违反物理规律的细微异常方面面临挑战。

Method: 提出归一化时空梯度(NSG)统计量，量化空间概率梯度与时间密度变化的比例，捕捉自然视频动态的偏差。利用预训练扩散模型开发NSG估计器，通过空间梯度近似和运动感知时间建模，无需复杂运动分解。基于此提出NSG-VD检测方法，计算测试视频与真实视频NSG特征的最大均值差异作为检测指标。

Result: 大量实验证实NSG-VD在召回率和F1分数上分别比最先进基线方法提升16.00%和10.75%，验证了其优越性能。

Conclusion: NSG-VD通过物理驱动的概率流守恒原理，能够有效检测AI生成视频，为视频真实性验证提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: AI-generated videos have achieved near-perfect visual realism (e.g., Sora),
urgently necessitating reliable detection mechanisms. However, detecting such
videos faces significant challenges in modeling high-dimensional spatiotemporal
dynamics and identifying subtle anomalies that violate physical laws. In this
paper, we propose a physics-driven AI-generated video detection paradigm based
on probability flow conservation principles. Specifically, we propose a
statistic called Normalized Spatiotemporal Gradient (NSG), which quantifies the
ratio of spatial probability gradients to temporal density changes, explicitly
capturing deviations from natural video dynamics. Leveraging pre-trained
diffusion models, we develop an NSG estimator through spatial gradients
approximation and motion-aware temporal modeling without complex motion
decomposition while preserving physical constraints. Building on this, we
propose an NSG-based video detection method (NSG-VD) that computes the Maximum
Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between NSG features of the test and real videos as a
detection metric. Last, we derive an upper bound of NSG feature distances
between real and generated videos, proving that generated videos exhibit
amplified discrepancies due to distributional shifts. Extensive experiments
confirm that NSG-VD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 16.00% in Recall
and 10.75% in F1-Score, validating the superior performance of NSG-VD. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度哈希后门攻击需要访问训练数据，但在现实世界中由于隐私保护和知识产权问题难以获得。因此需要开发无需训练数据即可植入后门的方法。

Method: 设计双语义引导的阴影后门攻击框架，仅使用替代数据集微调受害者模型的特定层。利用样本与邻居关系设计拓扑对齐损失，优化中毒样本向目标样本对齐。

Result: 在四个图像数据集、五种模型架构和两种哈希方法上的实验表明，DarkHash具有高有效性，优于现有最先进的后门攻击方法，并能抵御主流后门防御方法。

Conclusion: DarkHash成功实现了无需训练数据的深度哈希后门攻击，在保持检索精度的同时增强了攻击能力，对现有防御方法具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Benefiting from its superior feature learning capabilities and efficiency,
deep hashing has achieved remarkable success in large-scale image retrieval.
Recent studies have demonstrated the vulnerability of deep hashing models to
backdoor attacks. Although these studies have shown promising attack results,
they rely on access to the training dataset to implant the backdoor. In the
real world, obtaining such data (e.g., identity information) is often
prohibited due to privacy protection and intellectual property concerns.
Embedding backdoors into deep hashing models without access to the training
data, while maintaining retrieval accuracy for the original task, presents a
novel and challenging problem. In this paper, we propose DarkHash, the first
data-free backdoor attack against deep hashing. Specifically, we design a novel
shadow backdoor attack framework with dual-semantic guidance. It embeds
backdoor functionality and maintains original retrieval accuracy by fine-tuning
only specific layers of the victim model using a surrogate dataset. We consider
leveraging the relationship between individual samples and their neighbors to
enhance backdoor attacks during training. By designing a topological alignment
loss, we optimize both individual and neighboring poisoned samples toward the
target sample, further enhancing the attack capability. Experimental results on
four image datasets, five model architectures, and two hashing methods
demonstrate the high effectiveness of DarkHash, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art backdoor attack methods. Defense experiments show that
DarkHash can withstand existing mainstream backdoor defense methods.

Motivation: 解决极端视角下人脸解析精度不足的问题，因为此类姿态的标注数据有限且人工标注成本高昂。

Conclusion: 该方法为在真实场景中提高人脸解析鲁棒性提供了可扩展且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate face parsing under extreme viewing angles remains a significant
challenge due to limited labeled data in such poses. Manual annotation is
costly and often impractical at scale. We propose a novel label refinement
pipeline that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to generate accurate
segmentation masks from noisy multiview predictions. By jointly fitting two
3DGS models, one to RGB images and one to their initial segmentation maps, our
method enforces multiview consistency through shared geometry, enabling the
synthesis of pose-diverse training data with only minimal post-processing.
Fine-tuning a face parsing model on this refined dataset significantly improves
accuracy on challenging head poses, while maintaining strong performance on
standard views. Extensive experiments, including human evaluations, demonstrate
that our approach achieves superior results compared to state-of-the-art
methods, despite requiring no ground-truth 3D annotations and using only a
small set of initial images. Our method offers a scalable and effective
solution for improving face parsing robustness in real-world settings.

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) is important for diagnosis and
treatment planning for various medical conditions. Deep learning (DL) based
segmentation models may enable automated medical image analysis for detecting
and delineating tumors in CT images, thereby reducing clinicians' workload.
Achieving generalization capabilities in limited data domains, such as
radiology, requires modern DL models to be trained with image augmentation.
However, naively applying augmentation methods developed for natural images to
CT scans often disregards the nature of the CT modality, where the intensities
measure Hounsfield Units (HU) and have important physical meaning. This paper
challenges the use of such intensity augmentations for CT imaging and shows
that they may lead to artifacts and poor generalization. To mitigate this, we
propose a CT-specific augmentation technique, called Random windowing, that
exploits the available HU distribution of intensities in CT images. Random
windowing encourages robustness to contrast-enhancement and significantly
increases model performance on challenging images with poor contrast or timing.
We perform ablations and analysis of our method on multiple datasets, and
compare to, and outperform, state-of-the-art alternatives, while focusing on
the challenge of liver tumor segmentation.

Abstract: Real-time motion-controllable video generation remains challenging due to the
inherent latency of bidirectional diffusion models and the lack of effective
autoregressive (AR) approaches. Existing AR video diffusion models are limited
to simple control signals or text-to-video generation, and often suffer from
quality degradation and motion artifacts in few-step generation. To address
these challenges, we propose AR-Drag, the first RL-enhanced few-step AR video
diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation with diverse motion
control. We first fine-tune a base I2V model to support basic motion control,
then further improve it via reinforcement learning with a trajectory-based
reward model. Our design preserves the Markov property through a Self-Rollout
mechanism and accelerates training by selectively introducing stochasticity in
denoising steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AR-Drag achieves high
visual fidelity and precise motion alignment, significantly reducing latency
compared with state-of-the-art motion-controllable VDMs, while using only 1.3B
parameters. Additional visualizations can be found on our project page:

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种注意力增强方法TCAS，通过提高视频语言模型中跨模态注意力头的时间分辨能力，来解决模型对重述问题产生自相矛盾回答的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常产生自相矛盾的输出，严重影响其可靠性。在视频语言模型中，这种现象表现为模型无法基于其基础输出来提供逻辑一致的重述问题回答，但其根本原因尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 采用可解释性驱动的方法分析、统计总结和干预该现象。提出时间条件注意力锐化(TCAS)方法，构建基于注意力差异的增强目标，提高模型的时间分辨能力。

Conclusion: 时间逻辑一致性是时间理解中的瓶颈问题。通过增强一致性，该方法推动了视频时间理解的显著进展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate self-contradictory outputs, which
severely impacts their reliability and hinders their adoption in practical
applications. In video-language models (Video-LLMs), this phenomenon recently
draws the attention of researchers. Specifically, these models fail to provide
logically consistent responses to rephrased questions based on their grounding
outputs. However, the underlying causes of this phenomenon remain
underexplored. In this work, we adopt an interpretability-driven approach to
analyze, statistically summarize, and intervention the potential factors of the
phenomenon. We find that one of the primary reasons for the inconsistency in
responses lies in the inability of cross-modal attention heads to effectively
distinguish video tokens across different timestamps. To address this, we
propose an attention enhancement method called Temporally Conditioned Attention
Sharpening (TCAS), which constructs an enhancement objective based on attention
distinctions to enhance the model's temporal resolution capability, thereby
improving its temporal understanding logic consistency. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the temporal logic
consistency of Video-LLMs. Further interpretability analyses reveal that our
method indeed improves the temporal discriminability of attention heads,
validating our conclusions. Additionally, our method achieves performance
improvements in general video temporal grounding tasks, highlighting that
temporal logic consistency is a bottleneck in temporal understanding. By
enhancing consistency, our method drives significant progress in video temporal
understanding.

Conclusion: UniMMVSR成功解决了多模态条件在视频超分辨率中的利用问题，为高质量视频生成提供了新的技术路径，突破了现有技术的限制。

Abstract: Cascaded video super-resolution has emerged as a promising technique for
decoupling the computational burden associated with generating high-resolution
videos using large foundation models. Existing studies, however, are largely
confined to text-to-video tasks and fail to leverage additional generative
conditions beyond text, which are crucial for ensuring fidelity in multi-modal
video generation. We address this limitation by presenting UniMMVSR, the first
unified generative video super-resolution framework to incorporate hybrid-modal
conditions, including text, images, and videos. We conduct a comprehensive
exploration of condition injection strategies, training schemes, and data
mixture techniques within a latent video diffusion model. A key challenge was
designing distinct data construction and condition utilization methods to
enable the model to precisely utilize all condition types, given their varied
correlations with the target video. Our experiments demonstrate that UniMMVSR
significantly outperforms existing methods, producing videos with superior
detail and a higher degree of conformity to multi-modal conditions. We also
validate the feasibility of combining UniMMVSR with a base model to achieve
multi-modal guided generation of 4K video, a feat previously unattainable with
existing techniques.

Result: 在三个图像编辑基准上取得显著改进，生成了高质量的编辑结果。

Conclusion: MURE框架通过多模态推理链和置信度修剪机制，有效提升了复杂图像编辑任务的精度和保真度。

Abstract: Image editing with natural language has gained significant popularity, yet
existing methods struggle with intricate object intersections and fine-grained
spatial relationships due to the lack of an explicit reasoning process. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has been explored to enhance reasoning, purely textual
CoT or CoT augmented with coordinate information is fundamentally limited in
its ability to represent intricate visual layouts and lacks the necessary
visual cues to guide the generation of fine-grained, pixel-level details. To
address these challenges, we propose Multimodal Reasoning Edit (MURE), a novel
framework that shifts the visual editing process from purely text-based
reasoning to a series of interleaved textual and visual rationales. Our
framework performs image editing using a natively multimodal, interleaved
text-image CoT. This approach generates a step-by-step chain of reasoning where
a textual description is followed by a corresponding visual cue, such as a
positional mask that defined intended edited regions or a representation of new
content. Furthermore, to mitigate the hallucination phenomenon of large
language models, we introduce Multimodal Deep Confidence (MMDC) reasoning
paradigm. This paradigm explores a tree of visual reasoning paths at each step.
By pruning low-quality branches using a deep confidence score from a reward
model, it ensures the model consistently follows a high-quality trajectory
towards the final edited result. The proposed method decomposes complex editing
tasks into interdependent sub-tasks, achieving greater precision at each stage
and yielding high-fidelity edited results. We define the formulation for
interleaved text-image chains and release the first CoT-Edit-14K dataset,
comprising 14K high-quality editing examples. Extensive experiments show that
our method yields significant improvements across three image editing
benchmarks.

*Johann Schmidt,Sebastian Stober*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种自举算法，通过迭代重新对齐训练样本来改进细粒度视觉分类中的几何偏差处理，在多个基准测试中表现优于等变和规范化基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 细粒度视觉分类任务需要处理几何偏差和噪声（如不同方向和尺度），现有方法依赖数据增强或等变架构，但前者需要强大模型，后者限制表达能力并增加成本。规范化方法假设训练数据已对齐，但现实数据集无法满足此假设。

Method: 提出自举算法，通过迭代重新对齐训练样本，逐步减少方差并恢复对齐假设。建立了在任意紧致群下的收敛保证。

Result: 在四个细粒度视觉分类基准测试中，该方法始终优于等变和规范化基线方法，与数据增强方法表现相当。

Conclusion: 自举规范化方法能有效处理细粒度视觉分类中的几何偏差问题，在保持性能的同时避免了数据增强和等变架构的局限性。

Abstract: Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) tasks, such as insect and bird
identification, demand sensitivity to subtle visual cues while remaining robust
to spatial transformations. A key challenge is handling geometric biases and
noise, such as different orientations and scales of objects. Existing remedies
rely on heavy data augmentation, which demands powerful models, or on
equivariant architectures, which constrain expressivity and add cost.
Canonicalization offers an alternative by shielding such biases from the
downstream model. In practice, such functions are often obtained using
canonicalization priors, which assume aligned training data. Unfortunately,
real-world datasets never fulfill this assumption, causing the obtained
canonicalizer to be brittle. We propose a bootstrapping algorithm that
iteratively re-aligns training samples by progressively reducing variance and
recovering the alignment assumption. We establish convergence guarantees under
mild conditions for arbitrary compact groups, and show on four FGVC benchmarks
that our method consistently outperforms equivariant, and canonicalization
baselines while performing on par with augmentation.

*Haoran Yu,Yi Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstructUDrag是一个结合文本指令和对象拖拽的扩散模型框架，能够同时进行对象拖拽和基于文本的图像编辑，解决了传统方法在精确定位和语义控制方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本驱动图像编辑方法难以精确定位对象位置，而对象拖拽方法仅限于静态重定位。需要一种能够同时实现精确对象移动和语义属性控制的统一框架。

Method: 将对象拖拽视为图像重建过程，分为两个协同分支：移动重建分支使用基于能量的梯度引导来精确移动对象，文本驱动编辑分支共享梯度信号以确保一致变换。采用DDPM反演和噪声图先验信息注入来保持对象结构。

Result: 大量实验表明，InstructUDrag实现了灵活、高保真的图像编辑，在对象重定位精度和图像内容语义控制方面都表现出色。

Conclusion: InstructUDrag成功地将文本指令与对象拖拽相结合，为图像编辑提供了更精确和灵活的控制能力，是扩散模型在图像编辑领域的重要进展。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have shown great potential for image editing,
with techniques such as text-based and object-dragging methods emerging as key
approaches. However, each of these methods has inherent limitations: text-based
methods struggle with precise object positioning, while object dragging methods
are confined to static relocation. To address these issues, we propose
InstructUDrag, a diffusion-based framework that combines text instructions with
object dragging, enabling simultaneous object dragging and text-based image
editing. Our framework treats object dragging as an image reconstruction
process, divided into two synergistic branches. The moving-reconstruction
branch utilizes energy-based gradient guidance to move objects accurately,
refining cross-attention maps to enhance relocation precision. The text-driven
editing branch shares gradient signals with the reconstruction branch, ensuring
consistent transformations and allowing fine-grained control over object
attributes. We also employ DDPM inversion and inject prior information into
noise maps to preserve the structure of moved objects. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that InstructUDrag facilitates flexible, high-fidelity image
editing, offering both precision in object relocation and semantic control over
image content.

TL;DR: FineDual是一个三阶段的双人运动生成方法，通过动态分层建模从个体到交互再到整体的运动，解决了现有方法忽略距离和层次结构的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类交互本质上是动态和分层的，现有方法几乎都是时间不变地建模人类交互，忽略了距离和层次结构。

Method: 三阶段方法：1) 自学习阶段：通过大语言模型将双人整体文本分解为个体文本；2) 自适应调整阶段：预测交互距离并使用交互感知图网络建模；3) 教师引导精炼阶段：使用整体文本特征作为指导精炼运动特征。

Result: 在双人运动数据集上的广泛定量和定性评估表明，FineDual优于现有方法，有效建模了动态分层的人类交互。

Conclusion: FineDual能够生成细粒度和高质量的双人运动，成功解决了动态分层交互建模的挑战。

Abstract: Human interaction is inherently dynamic and hierarchical, where the dynamic
refers to the motion changes with distance, and the hierarchy is from
individual to inter-individual and ultimately to overall motion. Exploiting
these properties is vital for dual-human motion generation, while existing
methods almost model human interaction temporally invariantly, ignoring
distance and hierarchy. To address it, we propose a fine-grained dual-human
motion generation method, namely FineDual, a tri-stage method to model the
dynamic hierarchical interaction from individual to inter-individual. The first
stage, Self-Learning Stage, divides the dual-human overall text into individual
texts through a Large Language Model, aligning text features and motion
features at the individual level. The second stage, Adaptive Adjustment Stage,
predicts interaction distance by an interaction distance predictor, modeling
human interactions dynamically at the inter-individual level by an
interaction-aware graph network. The last stage, Teacher-Guided Refinement
Stage, utilizes overall text features as guidance to refine motion features at
the overall level, generating fine-grained and high-quality dual-human motion.
Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on dual-human motion
datasets demonstrate that our proposed FineDual outperforms existing
approaches, effectively modeling dynamic hierarchical human interaction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感图像多标签分类标注成本高且困难，单正多标签学习(SPML)作为实用替代方案但存在监督模糊性问题，而遥感领域相关研究有限

Method: AdaGC框架结合梯度校准机制、Mixup和双EMA模块生成鲁棒伪标签，并基于训练动态自适应触发梯度校准

Result: 在两个遥感基准数据集和两种不同标签噪声类型下，AdaGC均达到最先进性能，并在多样化设置中保持强鲁棒性

Conclusion: AdaGC为遥感图像单正多标签学习提供了一种新颖且通用的解决方案，有效缓解了监督模糊性问题

Abstract: Multi-label classification (MLC) offers a more comprehensive semantic
understanding of Remote Sensing (RS) imagery compared to traditional
single-label classification (SLC). However, obtaining complete annotations for
MLC is particularly challenging due to the complexity and high cost of the
labeling process. As a practical alternative, single-positive multi-label
learning (SPML) has emerged, where each image is annotated with only one
relevant label, and the model is expected to recover the full set of labels.
While scalable, SPML introduces significant supervision ambiguity, demanding
specialized solutions for model training. Although various SPML methods have
been proposed in the computer vision domain, research in the RS context remains
limited. To bridge this gap, we propose Adaptive Gradient Calibration (AdaGC),
a novel and generalizable SPML framework tailored to RS imagery. AdaGC adopts a
gradient calibration (GC) mechanism combined with Mixup and a dual exponential
moving average (EMA) module for robust pseudo-label generation. To maximize
AdaGC's effectiveness, we introduce a simple yet theoretically grounded
indicator to adaptively trigger GC after an initial warm-up stage based on
training dynamics, thereby guaranteeing the effectiveness of GC in mitigating
overfitting to label noise. Extensive experiments on two benchmark RS datasets
under two distinct label noise types demonstrate that AdaGC achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while maintaining strong robustness across
diverse settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了NTN-Diff方法，通过频率感知的扩散模型解决文本引导图像修复中的两个关键挑战：保持未掩码区域和实现掩码与未掩码区域的语义一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法同时解决文本引导图像修复中的两个核心问题：保持未掩码区域完整性和实现掩码与未掩码区域的语义一致性。这些问题源于混合频率带（如中低频）在去噪过程中对文本提示的不同鲁棒性。

Method: 提出NTN-Diff方法，将去噪过程分为早期（高级噪声）和晚期（低级噪声）阶段，在去噪过程中解耦中低频带。使用稳定的中频带作为指导，通过空文本去噪过程处理掩码区域的低频带，最后在晚期进行文本引导去噪。

Result: 大量实验验证了NTN-Diff在文本引导扩散模型中的优越性，能够同时保持未掩码区域并实现跨区域的语义一致性。

Conclusion: NTN-Diff通过频率感知的扩散模型有效解决了文本引导图像修复中的关键挑战，在保持未掩码区域的同时实现了掩码与未掩码区域的语义一致性。

Abstract: Text-guided image inpainting aims at reconstructing the masked regions as per
text prompts, where the longstanding challenges lie in the preservation for
unmasked regions, while achieving the semantics consistency between unmasked
and inpainted masked regions. Previous arts failed to address both of them,
always with either of them to be remedied. Such facts, as we observed, stem
from the entanglement of the hybrid (e.g., mid-and-low) frequency bands that
encode varied image properties, which exhibit different robustness to text
prompts during the denoising process. In this paper, we propose a
null-text-null frequency-aware diffusion models, dubbed \textbf{NTN-Diff}, for
text-guided image inpainting, by decomposing the semantics consistency across
masked and unmasked regions into the consistencies as per each frequency band,
while preserving the unmasked regions, to circumvent two challenges in a row.
Based on the diffusion process, we further divide the denoising process into
early (high-level noise) and late (low-level noise) stages, where the
mid-and-low frequency bands are disentangled during the denoising process. As
observed, the stable mid-frequency band is progressively denoised to be
semantically aligned during text-guided denoising process, which, meanwhile,
serves as the guidance to the null-text denoising process to denoise
low-frequency band for the masked regions, followed by a subsequent text-guided
denoising process at late stage, to achieve the semantics consistency for
mid-and-low frequency bands across masked and unmasked regions, while preserve
the unmasked regions. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of
NTN-Diff over the state-of-the-art diffusion models to text-guided diffusion
models. Our code can be accessed from https://github.com/htyjers/NTN-Diff.

Result: 在多个基准测试上实现最先进性能，比最佳基线改进超过55%，训练速度更快。

Conclusion: NExF能够从具有挑战性的真实世界捕获中稳健地重建高质量、3D一致外观的场景，适用于高动态范围场景。

Abstract: Recent advances in neural scene representations have led to unprecedented
quality in 3D reconstruction and view synthesis. Despite achieving high-quality
results for common benchmarks with curated data, outputs often degrade for data
that contain per image variations such as strong exposure changes, present,
e.g., in most scenes with indoor and outdoor areas or rooms with windows. In
this paper, we introduce Neural Exposure Fields (NExF), a novel technique for
robustly reconstructing 3D scenes with high quality and 3D-consistent
appearance from challenging real-world captures. In the core, we propose to
learn a neural field predicting an optimal exposure value per 3D point,
enabling us to optimize exposure along with the neural scene representation.
While capture devices such as cameras select optimal exposure per image/pixel,
we generalize this concept and perform optimization in 3D instead. This enables
accurate view synthesis in high dynamic range scenarios, bypassing the need of
post-processing steps or multi-exposure captures. Our contributions include a
novel neural representation for exposure prediction, a system for joint
optimization of the scene representation and the exposure field via a novel
neural conditioning mechanism, and demonstrated superior performance on
challenging real-world data. We find that our approach trains faster than prior
works and produces state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks improving by
over 55% over best-performing baselines.

Motivation: 解决参考视频分割中长程时序上下文信息提取的问题，现有方法在局部性和全局性之间平衡不佳，且计算复杂度随视频长度增加而显著增加。

Method: 提出LTCA机制：1）堆叠稀疏局部注意力（扩张窗口注意力）平衡局部性和全局性；2）每个查询从全局池中随机选择少量键进行注意力；3）设计全局查询与所有其他查询交互直接编码全局上下文信息。

Result: 在四个参考视频分割基准上实现了新的最先进性能，在MeViS valu和val数据集上分别提升了11.3%和8.3%。

Conclusion: LTCA机制能有效提取长程时序上下文信息，平衡局部性和全局性，显著提升参考视频分割性能。

Abstract: Referring Video Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment objects in videos given
linguistic expressions. The key to solving RVOS is to extract long-range
temporal context information from the interactions of expressions and videos to
depict the dynamic attributes of each object. Previous works either adopt
attention across all the frames or stack dense local attention to achieve a
global view of temporal context. However, they fail to strike a good balance
between locality and globality, and the computation complexity significantly
increases with the increase of video length. In this paper, we propose an
effective long-range temporal context attention (LTCA) mechanism to aggregate
global context information into object features. Specifically, we aggregate the
global context information from two aspects. Firstly, we stack sparse local
attentions to balance the locality and globality. We design a dilated window
attention across frames to aggregate local context information and perform such
attention in a stack of layers to enable a global view. Further, we enable each
query to attend to a small group of keys randomly selected from a global pool
to enhance the globality. Secondly, we design a global query to interact with
all the other queries to directly encode the global context information.
Experiments show our method achieves new state-of-the-art on four referring
video segmentation benchmarks. Notably, our method shows an improvement of
11.3% and 8.3% on the MeViS valu and val datasets respectively.

Conclusion: 通过将2D语义知识迁移到3D领域，提出的语义基础学习范式有效解决了3D功能分割中的语义边界模糊问题，显著提升了分割性能。

Abstract: Affordance segmentation aims to parse 3D objects into functionally distinct
parts, bridging recognition and interaction for applications in robotic
manipulation, embodied AI, and AR. While recent studies leverage visual or
textual prompts to guide this process, they often rely on point cloud encoders
as generic feature extractors, overlooking the intrinsic challenges of 3D data
such as sparsity, noise, and geometric ambiguity. As a result, 3D features
learned in isolation frequently lack clear and semantically consistent
functional boundaries. To address this bottleneck, we propose a
semantic-grounded learning paradigm that transfers rich semantic knowledge from
large-scale 2D Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) into the 3D domain.
Specifically, We introduce Cross-Modal Affinity Transfer (CMAT), a pre-training
strategy that aligns a 3D encoder with lifted 2D semantics and jointly
optimizes reconstruction, affinity, and diversity to yield semantically
organized representations. Building on this backbone, we further design the
Cross-modal Affordance Segmentation Transformer (CAST), which integrates
multi-modal prompts with CMAT-pretrained features to generate precise,
prompt-aware segmentation maps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework establishes new state-of-the-art results for 3D
affordance segmentation.

Abstract: Video diffusion models (DMs) have enabled high-quality video synthesis.
However, their computation costs scale quadratically with sequence length
because self-attention has quadratic complexity. While linear attention lowers
the cost, fully replacing quadratic attention requires expensive pretraining
due to the limited expressiveness of linear attention and the complexity of
spatiotemporal modeling in video generation. In this paper, we present
LinVideo, an efficient data-free post-training framework that replaces a target
number of self-attention modules with linear attention while preserving the
original model's performance. First, we observe a significant disparity in the
replaceability of different layers. Instead of manual or heuristic choices, we
frame layer selection as a binary classification problem and propose selective
transfer, which automatically and progressively converts layers to linear
attention with minimal performance impact. Additionally, to overcome the
ineffectiveness and inefficiency of existing objectives for this transfer
process, we introduce an anytime distribution matching (ADM) objective that
aligns the distributions of samples across any timestep along the sampling
trajectory. This objective is efficient and recovers model performance.
Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a 1.25-2.00x speedup while
preserving generation quality, and our 4-step distilled model further delivers
a 15.92x latency reduction with minimal visual quality drop.

Conclusion: 当前的小型视觉语言模型在交通场景感知任务上表现不佳，与人类存在显著差距，特别是在特定感知任务上存在明显挑战。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly powerful,
demonstrating strong performance on a variety of tasks that require both visual
and textual understanding. Their strong generalisation abilities make them a
promising component for automated driving systems, which must handle unexpected
corner cases. However, to be trusted in such safety-critical applications, a
model must first possess a reliable perception system. Moreover, since critical
objects and agents in traffic scenes are often at a distance, we require
systems that are not "shortsighted", i.e., systems with strong perception
capabilities at both close (up to 20 meters) and long (30+ meters) range. With
this in mind, we introduce Distance-Annotated Traffic Perception Question
Answering (DTPQA), the first Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark focused
solely on perception-based questions in traffic scenes, enriched with distance
annotations. By excluding questions that require reasoning, we ensure that
model performance reflects perception capabilities alone. Since automated
driving hardware has limited processing power and cannot support large VLMs,
our study centers on smaller VLMs. More specifically, we evaluate several
state-of-the-art (SOTA) small VLMs on DTPQA and show that, despite the
simplicity of the questions, these models significantly underperform compared
to humans (~60% average accuracy for the best-performing small VLM versus ~85%
human performance). However, it is important to note that the human sample size
was relatively small, which imposes statistical limitations. We also identify
specific perception tasks, such as distinguishing left from right, that remain
particularly challenging for these models.

Abstract: The introduction of new generation hyperspectral satellite sensors, combined
with advancements in deep learning methodologies, has significantly enhanced
the ability to discriminate detailed land-cover classes at medium-large scales.
However, a significant challenge in deep learning methods is the risk of
overfitting when training networks with small labeled datasets. In this work,
we propose a data augmentation technique that leverages a guided diffusion
model. To effectively train the model with a limited number of labeled samples
and to capture complex patterns in the data, we implement a lightweight
transformer network. Additionally, we introduce a modified weighted loss
function and an optimized cosine variance scheduler, which facilitate fast and
effective training on small datasets. We evaluate the effectiveness of the
proposed method on a forest classification task with 10 different forest types
using hyperspectral images acquired by the PRISMA satellite. The results
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other data augmentation
techniques in both average and weighted average accuracy. The effectiveness of
the method is further highlighted by the stable training behavior of the model,
which addresses a common limitation in the practical application of deep
generative models for data augmentation.

to the video domain. UniVideo adopts a dual-stream design, combining a
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for instruction understanding with a
Multimodal DiT (MMDiT) for video generation. This design enables accurate
interpretation of complex multimodal instructions while preserving visual
consistency. Built on this architecture, UniVideo unifies diverse video
generation and editing tasks under a single multimodal instruction paradigm and
is jointly trained across them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniVideo
matches or surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific baselines in
text/image-to-video generation, in-context video generation and in-context
video editing. Notably, the unified design of UniVideo enables two forms of
generalization. First, UniVideo supports task composition, such as combining
editing with style transfer, by integrating multiple capabilities within a
single instruction. Second, even without explicit training on free-form video
editing, UniVideo transfers its editing capability from large-scale image
editing data to this setting, handling unseen instructions such as
green-screening characters or changing materials within a video. Beyond these
core capabilities, UniVideo also supports visual-prompt-based video generation,
where the MLLM interprets visual prompts and guides the MMDiT during synthesis.
To foster future research, we will release our model and code.

*Sofia Kirsanova,Yao-Yi Chiang,Weiwei Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合LayoutLMv3和GPT-4o的方法，用于自动检测和链接历史地图图例中的符号与描述，通过边界框预测实现结构化解析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史地图图例对于解释制图符号至关重要，但其不一致的布局和非结构化格式使得自动提取具有挑战性。现有方法主要关注分割或通用OCR，很少有方法能有效匹配图例符号与对应描述。

Method: 结合LayoutLMv3进行布局检测，使用GPT-4o通过上下文学习来检测和链接图例项及其描述，基于边界框预测实现结构化匹配。

Result: 实验显示GPT-4结合结构化JSON提示优于基线方法，达到88% F-1分数和85% IoU，并揭示了提示设计、示例数量和布局对齐对性能的影响。

Conclusion: 该方法支持可扩展的、布局感知的图例解析，提高了各种视觉风格历史地图的索引和可搜索性。

Abstract: Historical map legends are critical for interpreting cartographic symbols.
However, their inconsistent layouts and unstructured formats make automatic
extraction challenging. Prior work focuses primarily on segmentation or general
optical character recognition (OCR), with few methods effectively matching
legend symbols to their corresponding descriptions in a structured manner. We
present a method that combines LayoutLMv3 for layout detection with GPT-4o
using in-context learning to detect and link legend items and their
descriptions via bounding box predictions. Our experiments show that GPT-4 with
structured JSON prompts outperforms the baseline, achieving 88% F-1 and 85%
IoU, and reveal how prompt design, example counts, and layout alignment affect
performance. This approach supports scalable, layout-aware legend parsing and
improves the indexing and searchability of historical maps across various
visual styles.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于课程学习的源自由域自适应框架LFC，通过从易到难和从源到目标的课程设计，在无需源数据的情况下实现医疗图像的域自适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医疗图像数据隐私和安全问题，现有源自由域自适应方法主要关注伪标签精炼而忽略了学习过程，渐进式学习过程有助于知识迁移。

Method: LFC框架包含两个课程：从易到难课程从简单样本开始学习，逐步增加样本难度调整优化方向；从源到目标课程确保模型从源域到目标域的平稳迁移。

Result: 在眼底分割和息肉分割的跨域数据集上评估，实验结果表明该方法超越了现有方法，达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 提出的课程学习框架有效解决了源自由域自适应问题，在保护数据隐私的同时实现了优异的域自适应性能。

Abstract: Recent studies have uncovered a new research line, namely source-free domain
adaptation, which adapts a model to target domains without using the source
data. Such a setting can address the concerns on data privacy and security
issues of medical images. However, current source-free domain adaptation
frameworks mainly focus on the pseudo label refinement for target data without
the consideration of learning procedure. Indeed, a progressive learning process
from source to target domain will benefit the knowledge transfer during model
adaptation. To this end, we propose a curriculum-based framework, namely
learning from curriculum (LFC), for source-free domain adaptation, which
consists of easy-to-hard and source-to-target curricula. Concretely, the former
curriculum enables the framework to start learning with `easy' samples and
gradually tune the optimization direction of model adaption by increasing the
sample difficulty. While, the latter can stablize the adaptation process, which
ensures smooth transfer of the model from the source domain to the target. We
evaluate the proposed source-free domain adaptation approach on the public
cross-domain datasets for fundus segmentation and polyp segmentation. The
extensive experimental results show that our framework surpasses the existing
approaches and achieves a new state-of-the-art.

TL;DR: VideoVerse是一个新的文本到视频生成基准测试，专注于评估模型对真实世界复杂时间因果关系和世界知识的理解能力，填补了现有基准在事件级时间因果性和世界知识评估方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频生成基准测试无法区分最先进的模型，缺乏对事件级时间因果关系和世界知识的系统评估，而这些是构建世界模型的关键能力。

Method: 收集跨领域代表性视频，提取具有内在时间因果关系的事件级描述，由独立标注者重写为文本到视频提示，设计包含10个维度的二元评估问题，开发基于现代视觉语言模型的人类偏好对齐QA评估流程。

Result: 构建了包含300个精心策划提示、815个事件和793个二元评估问题的VideoVerse基准，并对开源和闭源的最先进文本到视频模型进行了系统评估。

Conclusion: VideoVerse基准为评估文本到视频模型在时间因果关系和世界知识理解方面的能力提供了全面框架，有助于分析当前模型与世界模型之间的差距。

Abstract: The recent rapid advancement of Text-to-Video (T2V) generation technologies,
which are critical to build ``world models'', makes the existing benchmarks
increasingly insufficient to evaluate state-of-the-art T2V models. First,
current evaluation dimensions, such as per-frame aesthetic quality and temporal
consistency, are no longer able to differentiate state-of-the-art T2V models.
Second, event-level temporal causality, which not only distinguishes video from
other modalities but also constitutes a crucial component of world models, is
severely underexplored in existing benchmarks. Third, existing benchmarks lack
a systematic assessment of world knowledge, which are essential capabilities
for building world models. To address these issues, we introduce VideoVerse, a
comprehensive benchmark that focuses on evaluating whether a T2V model could
understand complex temporal causality and world knowledge in the real world. We
collect representative videos across diverse domains (e.g., natural landscapes,
sports, indoor scenes, science fiction, chemical and physical experiments) and
extract their event-level descriptions with inherent temporal causality, which
are then rewritten into text-to-video prompts by independent annotators. For
each prompt, we design a suite of binary evaluation questions from the
perspective of dynamic and static properties, with a total of ten carefully
defined evaluation dimensions. In total, our VideoVerse comprises 300 carefully
curated prompts, involving 815 events and 793 binary evaluation questions.
Consequently, a human preference aligned QA-based evaluation pipeline is
developed by using modern vision-language models. Finally, we perform a
systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source T2V
models on VideoVerse, providing in-depth analysis on how far the current T2V
generators are from world models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文首次将连续时间一致性蒸馏扩展到通用应用级图像和视频扩散模型，提出了分数正则化连续时间一致性模型(rCM)，解决了sCM在细节生成上的质量限制，在14B参数模型和5秒视频上实现15-50倍加速，质量优于DMD2且保持高多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然连续时间一致性模型(sCM)在学术规模扩散加速中表现出色，但其在大规模文本到图像和视频任务中的适用性仍不明确，主要面临雅可比向量积计算的基础设施挑战和标准评估基准的局限性。

Method: 开发并行兼容的FlashAttention-2 JVP核，提出分数正则化连续时间一致性模型(rCM)，通过分数蒸馏作为长跳跃正则器，将"模式覆盖"的前向散度与"模式寻求"的反向散度相结合。

Result: 在14B参数模型和5秒视频任务上验证，rCM在质量指标上匹配或超越最先进的蒸馏方法DMD2，同时在多样性方面具有显著优势，仅需1-4步即可生成高保真样本，实现15-50倍加速。

Conclusion: rCM作为一个实用且理论基础的框架，为推进大规模扩散蒸馏提供了有效解决方案，无需GAN调优或大量超参数搜索。

Abstract: This work represents the first effort to scale up continuous-time consistency
distillation to general application-level image and video diffusion models.
Although continuous-time consistency model (sCM) is theoretically principled
and empirically powerful for accelerating academic-scale diffusion, its
applicability to large-scale text-to-image and video tasks remains unclear due
to infrastructure challenges in Jacobian-vector product (JVP) computation and
the limitations of standard evaluation benchmarks. We first develop a
parallelism-compatible FlashAttention-2 JVP kernel, enabling sCM training on
models with over 10 billion parameters and high-dimensional video tasks. Our
investigation reveals fundamental quality limitations of sCM in fine-detail
generation, which we attribute to error accumulation and the "mode-covering"
nature of its forward-divergence objective. To remedy this, we propose the
score-regularized continuous-time consistency model (rCM), which incorporates
score distillation as a long-skip regularizer. This integration complements sCM
with the "mode-seeking" reverse divergence, effectively improving visual
quality while maintaining high generation diversity. Validated on large-scale
models (Cosmos-Predict2, Wan2.1) up to 14B parameters and 5-second videos, rCM
matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art distillation method DMD2 on quality
metrics while offering notable advantages in diversity, all without GAN tuning
or extensive hyperparameter searches. The distilled models generate
high-fidelity samples in only $1\sim4$ steps, accelerating diffusion sampling
by $15\times\sim50\times$. These results position rCM as a practical and
theoretically grounded framework for advancing large-scale diffusion
distillation.

TL;DR: 提出一个模块化空间图像处理框架，集成了灰度量化、色彩增强、图像锐化、双向变换管道和几何特征提取，在多样化数据集上展现出稳健的确定性性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个综合性的图像处理框架，能够处理从基础灰度量化到复杂几何特征提取的多种任务，满足实时图像分析和计算机视觉应用的需求。

Method: 采用模块化方法：灰度量化（8级离散化）、色彩增强（RGB和YCrCb空间的直方图均衡）、亮度调整（HSV值通道操作）、图像锐化（3×3卷积核）、双向变换管道（包括反锐化掩模、伽马校正和噪声放大）、几何特征提取（Canny边缘检测、Hough线估计、Harris角点检测和形态学窗口定位）。

Result: 双向变换管道在正向和反向过程中分别达到76.10%和74.80%的准确率；Hough线估计实现51.50°的台球杆对齐；线索隔离与真实图像达到81.87%的相似度；在多样化数据集上表现出稳健性能。

Conclusion: 该模块化框架在图像处理任务中展现出高效和确定性，具有实时图像分析和计算机视觉应用的潜力。

Abstract: This study introduces a modular framework for spatial image processing,
integrating grayscale quantization, color and brightness enhancement, image
sharpening, bidirectional transformation pipelines, and geometric feature
extraction. A stepwise intensity transformation quantizes grayscale images into
eight discrete levels, producing a posterization effect that simplifies
representation while preserving structural detail. Color enhancement is
achieved via histogram equalization in both RGB and YCrCb color spaces, with
the latter improving contrast while maintaining chrominance fidelity.
Brightness adjustment is implemented through HSV value-channel manipulation,
and image sharpening is performed using a 3 * 3 convolution kernel to enhance
high-frequency details. A bidirectional transformation pipeline that integrates
unsharp masking, gamma correction, and noise amplification achieved accuracy
levels of 76.10% and 74.80% for the forward and reverse processes,
respectively. Geometric feature extraction employed Canny edge detection,
Hough-based line estimation (e.g., 51.50{\deg} for billiard cue alignment),
Harris corner detection, and morphological window localization. Cue isolation
further yielded 81.87\% similarity against ground truth images. Experimental
evaluation across diverse datasets demonstrates robust and deterministic
performance, highlighting its potential for real-time image analysis and
computer vision.

TL;DR: Video-STAR是一个用于开放词汇动作识别的框架，通过上下文子动作分解和工具增强强化学习，解决了多模态大语言模型在语义相似动作区分上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型依赖文本先验，在开放词汇场景中难以区分语义相似的动作，存在跨模态幻觉问题。

Method: 将动作分解为可区分的子动作进行细粒度匹配，同时动态调用领域特定工具进行跨模态交织，通过分层奖励机制平衡工具使用效率、子动作相关性和推理结构连贯性。

Result: 在HMDB-51、UCF-101、SSv2、Kinetics-400和Kinetics-600数据集上达到最先进性能，在区分细粒度动作和处理跨模态幻觉方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Video-STAR通过子动作分解和工具增强强化学习，有效提升了开放词汇动作识别的性能，具有良好的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
potential in bridging visual and textual reasoning, yet their reliance on
text-centric priors often limits their ability to disentangle semantically
similar actions in open-vocabulary scenarios. To address this, we propose
Video-STAR, a framework that harmonizes contextual sub-motion decomposition
with tool-augmented reinforcement learning for open-vocabulary action
recognition (OVAR). Unlike prior methods that treat actions as monolithic
entities, our approach innovatively decomposes actions into discriminative
sub-motions for fine-grained matching while dynamically invoking
domain-specific tools for cross-modal interleaving, thereby enabling
category-specific reasoning capacity and reducing cross-modal hallucination.
Moreover, by designing a hierarchical reward that balances tool-usage
efficiency, sub-motion relevance, and structural coherence in reasoning, our
method autonomously leverages external tools to prioritize sub-motion patterns
without explicit supervision, transmitting from text-centric reasoning to
visually grounded inference. Extensive evaluations on HMDB-51, UCF-101, SSv2,
Kinetics-400, and Kinetics-600 datasets demonstrate our state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods in distinguishing fine-grained
actions and handling cross-modal hallucination, validating our excellent
robustness and generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于视频的视觉象似性挑战基准，用于评估视觉语言模型在动态手语中的象似性理解能力，包括音系形式预测、透明度和象似性评分三个任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手语中的象似性（语言形式与意义的相似性）为视觉基础提供了自然测试平台，需要从动态人体运动中恢复这种基本映射关系。

Method: 引入视觉象似性挑战基准，采用心理语言学测量方法评估13个最先进的视觉语言模型在零样本和少样本设置下的表现，并与人类基线进行比较。

Result: 模型在音系形式预测中能恢复部分手形和位置细节但低于人类表现；在透明度任务中远低于人类基线；只有顶级模型与人类象似性评分呈中等相关。有趣的是，音系形式预测能力更强的模型与人类象似性判断相关性更好。

Conclusion: 验证了这些诊断任务的有效性，并强调了需要人类中心信号和具身学习方法来建模象似性和改进多模态模型的视觉基础能力。

Abstract: Iconicity, the resemblance between linguistic form and meaning, is pervasive
in signed languages, offering a natural testbed for visual grounding. For
vision-language models (VLMs), the challenge is to recover such essential
mappings from dynamic human motion rather than static context. We introduce the
\textit{Visual Iconicity Challenge}, a novel video-based benchmark that adapts
psycholinguistic measures to evaluate VLMs on three tasks: (i) phonological
sign-form prediction (e.g., handshape, location), (ii) transparency (inferring
meaning from visual form), and (iii) graded iconicity ratings. We assess $13$
state-of-the-art VLMs in zero- and few-shot settings on Sign Language of the
Netherlands and compare them to human baselines. On \textit{phonological form
prediction}, VLMs recover some handshape and location detail but remain below
human performance; on \textit{transparency}, they are far from human baselines;
and only top models correlate moderately with human \textit{iconicity ratings}.
Interestingly, \textit{models with stronger phonological form prediction
correlate better with human iconicity judgment}, indicating shared sensitivity
to visually grounded structure. Our findings validate these diagnostic tasks
and motivate human-centric signals and embodied learning methods for modelling
iconicity and improving visual grounding in multimodal models.

Abstract: With recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) showing
strong visual understanding and reasoning, interest is growing in using them to
improve the editing performance of diffusion models. Despite rapid progress,
most studies lack an in-depth analysis of MLLM design choices. Moreover, the
integration of MLLMs and diffusion models remains an open challenge in some
difficult tasks, such as video editing. In this paper, we present InstructX, a
unified framework for image and video editing. Specifically, we conduct a
comprehensive study on integrating MLLMs and diffusion models for
instruction-driven editing across diverse tasks. Building on this study, we
analyze the cooperation and distinction between images and videos in unified
modeling. (1) We show that training on image data can lead to emergent video
editing capabilities without explicit supervision, thereby alleviating the
constraints imposed by scarce video training data. (2) By incorporating
modality-specific MLLM features, our approach effectively unifies image and
video editing tasks within a single model. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method can handle a broad range of image and video editing tasks and
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 现实世界视频常因采集和传输条件不同而遭受噪声、压缩伪影、低光失真等多种复杂退化，现有方法需要人工选择专门模型或采用单一架构，难以泛化处理各种退化类型。

Method: 构建大规模高分辨率视频退化识别基准，使用视觉语言模型进行退化识别；引入基于大语言模型的自适应路由器学习恢复策略；构建Res-VQ数据集并设计专门的VLM视频质量评估模型。

Result: 大量实验表明，MoA-VR能有效处理多样化和复合退化，在客观指标和感知质量方面均优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 多模态智能和模块化推理的整合在通用视频恢复系统中具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Real-world videos often suffer from complex degradations, such as noise,
compression artifacts, and low-light distortions, due to diverse acquisition
and transmission conditions. Existing restoration methods typically require
professional manual selection of specialized models or rely on monolithic
architectures that fail to generalize across varying degradations. Inspired by
expert experience, we propose MoA-VR, the first
\underline{M}ixture-\underline{o}f-\underline{A}gents \underline{V}ideo
\underline{R}estoration system that mimics the reasoning and processing
procedures of human professionals through three coordinated agents: Degradation
Identification, Routing and Restoration, and Restoration Quality Assessment.
Specifically, we construct a large-scale and high-resolution video degradation
recognition benchmark and build a vision-language model (VLM) driven
degradation identifier. We further introduce a self-adaptive router powered by
large language models (LLMs), which autonomously learns effective restoration
strategies by observing tool usage patterns. To assess intermediate and final
processed video quality, we construct the \underline{Res}tored
\underline{V}ideo \underline{Q}uality (Res-VQ) dataset and design a dedicated
VLM-based video quality assessment (VQA) model tailored for restoration tasks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoA-VR effectively handles diverse and
compound degradations, consistently outperforming existing baselines in terms
of both objective metrics and perceptual quality. These results highlight the
potential of integrating multimodal intelligence and modular reasoning in
general-purpose video restoration systems.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLM中的注意力汇，但很少研究ViT视觉编码器中的注意力汇。这些ViT注意力汇包含重要语义信息，但在现有LVLM架构中往往被忽视，限制了模型的视觉理解能力。

Method: 提出定性和定量分析ViT注意力汇中嵌入的信息，并开发了无需训练和基于训练的方法来更好地利用这些信息，探索LLM如何解释这些信息及其影响程度。

Result: 通过显式利用ViT注意力汇标记，在多种LVLM和视觉推理任务上实现了显著改进，证明了ViT注意力汇在增强视觉推理方面的潜力。

Conclusion: ViT注意力汇是LVLM中未被充分利用的重要资源，通过有效利用这些标记可以显著提升模型的视觉理解和推理能力。

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have recently emerged as powerful
architectures capable of understanding and reasoning over both visual and
textual information. These models typically rely on two key components: a
Vision Transformer (ViT) and a Large Language Model (LLM). ViT encodes visual
content into a sequence of image tokens and serves as the perceptual front-end
-- the eyes of the model. In contrast, the LLM interprets these tokens to
perform high-level reasoning, generates responses, and functions as the
cognitive core -- the brain of the model. However, it remains unclear which
visual tokens contribute most significantly to understanding and reasoning, and
how effectively these signals are propagated from ViT to the LLM. While most
existing works have focused on identifying attention sinks, low-semantic tokens
receiving disproportionately high attention, within the LLM, we shift the focus
to the vision encoder by identifying a class of high-norm visual tokens from
ViT, referred to as ViT attention sinks -- a problem that has been rarely
studied but is indeed very important for LVLMs. Our findings show that these
ViT sinks encapsulate high-level semantic concepts from images, allowing the
LLM to perform more effective understanding and reasoning. Despite their
importance, these sink tokens are often overlooked in existing LVLM
architectures. To explore their contribution, we present both qualitative and
quantitative analyses of the information embedded in these sink tokens. We also
propose both training-free and training-based approaches to better leverage how
this information is interpreted by the LLM, and to what extent. By explicitly
utilizing these tokens, we demonstrate substantial improvements across a range
of LVLMs and visual reasoning tasks, highlighting the untapped potential of ViT
attention sinks in enhancing visual reasoning.

Method: 提出Universal Winning Slice Hypothesis理论框架，基于谱平衡和任务能量两个现象。开发SliceFine方法，只更新原始权重的选定切片，不引入新参数。

Result: SliceFine在语言和视觉任务上达到最先进PEFT方法的性能，同时显著提升训练速度、内存效率和模型紧凑性。

Conclusion: 该工作连接了理论与实践，为现有PEFT技术提供了理论基础的替代方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical framework explaining why fine tuning small,
randomly selected subnetworks (slices) within pre trained models can be
sufficient for downstream adaptation. We prove that pretrained networks exhibit
a universal winning slice property arising from two phenomena: (1) spectral
balance the eigenspectra of different weight matrix slices are remarkably
similar; and (2) high task energy their backbone representations retain rich,
task relevant features. This leads to the Universal Winning Slice Hypothesis,
which provides a theoretical foundation for parameter efficient fine tuning
(PEFT) in large scale models. Inspired by this, we propose SliceFine, a PEFT
method that exploits this inherent redundancy by updating only selected slices
of the original weights introducing zero new parameters, unlike adapter-based
approaches. Empirically, SliceFine matches the performance of state of the art
PEFT methods across language and vision tasks, while significantly improving
training speed, memory efficiency, and model compactness. Our work bridges
theory and practice, offering a theoretically grounded alternative to existing
PEFT techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频生成方法在轨迹控制方面存在局限性，需要更灵活、多粒度的轨迹控制能力，同时保持时间一致性和高效推理。

Method: 引入统一的点运动表示（分割ID、轨迹ID、颜色通道），采用序列拼接方案而非token拼接或ControlNet，使用退火训练策略逐步减少对完整监督和对齐条件的依赖。

Result: 实验结果表明FlexTraj能够实现多粒度、对齐无关的轨迹控制，支持运动克隆、拖拽式图像到视频、运动插值、相机重定向等多种应用。

Conclusion: FlexTraj通过创新的点轨迹表示和训练策略，在保持高效推理的同时实现了灵活的视频生成控制，为各种视频生成应用提供了强大的轨迹控制能力。

Abstract: We present FlexTraj, a framework for image-to-video generation with flexible
point trajectory control. FlexTraj introduces a unified point-based motion
representation that encodes each point with a segmentation ID, a temporally
consistent trajectory ID, and an optional color channel for appearance cues,
enabling both dense and sparse trajectory control. Instead of injecting
trajectory conditions into the video generator through token concatenation or
ControlNet, FlexTraj employs an efficient sequence-concatenation scheme that
achieves faster convergence, stronger controllability, and more efficient
inference, while maintaining robustness under unaligned conditions. To train
such a unified point trajectory-controlled video generator, FlexTraj adopts an
annealing training strategy that gradually reduces reliance on complete
supervision and aligned condition. Experimental results demonstrate that
FlexTraj enables multi-granularity, alignment-agnostic trajectory control for
video generation, supporting various applications such as motion cloning,
drag-based image-to-video, motion interpolation, camera redirection, flexible
action control and mesh animations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了SpatialLadder方法，通过渐进式训练框架解决VLM空间推理问题，在多个基准测试中取得SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法试图直接学习空间推理而缺乏感知和理解的分层基础，导致性能受限

Method: 构建SpatialLadder-26k数据集，采用三阶段渐进训练：空间感知（目标定位）、空间理解（多维空间任务）、复杂推理（带可验证奖励的强化学习）

Result: SpatialLadder模型在空间推理基准上平均提升23.4%，超越GPT-4o 20.8%和Gemini-2.0-Flash 10.1%，在域外基准上提升7.2%

Conclusion: 从感知到推理的渐进式训练对于构建稳健的空间智能至关重要

Abstract: Spatial reasoning remains a fundamental challenge for Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), with current approaches struggling to achieve robust performance
despite recent advances. We identify that this limitation stems from a critical
gap: existing methods attempt to learn spatial reasoning directly without
establishing the hierarchical foundations of perception and understanding. To
address this challenge, we present a comprehensive methodology for building
spatial intelligence progressively. We introduce SpatialLadder-26k, a
multimodal dataset containing 26,610 samples spanning object localization,
single image, multi-view, and video spatial reasoning tasks, constructed
through a standardized pipeline that ensures systematic coverage across
modalities. Building on this dataset, we design a three-stage progressive
training framework that (1) establishes spatial perception through object
localization, (2) develops spatial understanding through multi-dimensional
spatial tasks, and (3) strengthens complex reasoning via reinforcement learning
with verifiable rewards. This approach yields SpatialLadder, a 3B-parameter
model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial reasoning
benchmarks, with 23.4% average improvement over the base model, surpassing
GPT-4o by 20.8% and Gemini-2.0-Flash by 10.1%. Notably, SpatialLadder maintains
strong generalization with 7.2% improvement on out-of-domain benchmarks,
demonstrating that progressive training from perception to reasoning is
essential for robust spatial intelligence.

*Rishubh Parihar,Or Patashnik,Daniil Ostashev,R. Venkatesh Babu,Daniel Cohen-Or,Kuan-Chieh Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Kontinuous Kontext是一个指令驱动的图像编辑模型，通过引入标量编辑强度参数，让用户能够从无变化到完全实现结果的连续范围内精细控制编辑程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于指令的图像编辑方法仅依赖文本指令，缺乏对编辑程度的精细控制。本文旨在提供一种能够连续调整编辑强度的新维度控制。

Method: 扩展了最先进的图像编辑模型，增加标量编辑强度输入，训练轻量级投影网络将标量和编辑指令映射到模型的调制空间系数，使用生成模型合成四元组数据集进行训练。

Result: Kontinuous Kontext实现了从细微到强烈的编辑强度连续控制，支持风格化、属性、材质、背景和形状变化等多种操作，无需特定属性训练。

Conclusion: 该模型为指令驱动的图像编辑提供了统一的精细控制方法，能够平滑连续地调整编辑强度，增强了用户对编辑过程的控制能力。

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing offers a powerful and intuitive way to
manipulate images through natural language. Yet, relying solely on text
instructions limits fine-grained control over the extent of edits. We introduce
Kontinuous Kontext, an instruction-driven editing model that provides a new
dimension of control over edit strength, enabling users to adjust edits
gradually from no change to a fully realized result in a smooth and continuous
manner. Kontinuous Kontext extends a state-of-the-art image editing model to
accept an additional input, a scalar edit strength which is then paired with
the edit instruction, enabling explicit control over the extent of the edit. To
inject this scalar information, we train a lightweight projector network that
maps the input scalar and the edit instruction to coefficients in the model's
modulation space. For training our model, we synthesize a diverse dataset of
image-edit-instruction-strength quadruplets using existing generative models,
followed by a filtering stage to ensure quality and consistency. Kontinuous
Kontext provides a unified approach for fine-grained control over edit strength
for instruction driven editing from subtle to strong across diverse operations
such as stylization, attribute, material, background, and shape changes,
without requiring attribute-specific training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了MM-HELIX基准测试来评估多模态大语言模型的长链反思推理能力，发现现有模型存在显著性能缺陷。通过构建MM-HELIX-100K数据集和提出自适应混合策略优化方法，显著提升了模型在复杂推理任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在数学和逻辑推理任务上表现出色，但其长链反思推理能力（解决复杂现实问题所需的关键能力）尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 1) 构建MM-HELIX基准测试，包含1,260个需要迭代思考和回溯的挑战性任务；2) 开发步骤引导响应生成流程创建MM-HELIX-100K数据集；3) 提出自适应混合策略优化方法，动态统一离线监督和在线优化。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-7B基准模型上，该方法在MM-HELIX基准测试上实现了+18.6%的准确率提升，在通用数学和逻辑任务上平均性能提升+5.7%。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型的反思推理能力可以有效学习和泛化，为开发更强大的MLLMs铺平了道路。

Abstract: While current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
proficiency in reasoning tasks such as mathematics and logic, their capacity
for long-chain reflective reasoning, a prerequisite for solving complex
real-world problems, remains largely underexplored. In this work, we first
conduct an extensive empirical investigation to evaluate this capability.
Leveraging a carefully designed data synthesis engine, we construct MM-HELIX, a
multimodal benchmark consisting 1,260 samples of 42 challenging synthetic tasks
that require iterative thinking and backtracking. Empirical results on this
benchmark reveal that existing MLLMs exhibit significant performance deficits
in long-chain reflective reasoning. To address this limitation, we generate
post-training data and further explore learning paradigms for exploiting such
data. We first develop the Step-Elicited Response Generation pipeline to create
MM-HELIX-100K, a large-scale dataset of 100k high-quality, reflective reasoning
traces for instruction-tuning stage. Given that standard Reinforcement Learning
fails on complex tasks due to sparse reward signals and catastrophic forgetting
after Supervised Fine-Tuning, we propose Adaptive Hybrid Policy Optimization
(AHPO), a novel training strategy that dynamically unifies offline supervision
and online optimization into a single stage. This strategy enables the model to
learn from expert data when rewards are sparse and conduct independent
exploration once proficient. When applied to the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline, our
method achieves a +18.6\% accuracy improvement on MM-HELIX benchmark and
demonstrates strong generalization with a +5.7\% average performance gain on
general mathematic and logic tasks. Our work demonstrate that reflective
reasoning in MLLMs can be effectively learned and generalized, paving the way
for developing more capable MLLMs.

*Nikhil Reddy Varimalla,Yunfei Xu,Arkadiy Saakyan,Meng Fan Wang,Smaranda Muresan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoNorms是一个包含1000多个视频片段与文化规范对的数据集，用于评估视频大语言模型的文化意识，涵盖中美文化背景下的社会文化规范、规范遵守与违反标签以及言语和非言语证据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视频大语言模型在全球部署，需要评估其对相关文化背景的理解和基础。现有基准不足以充分评估模型的文化意识。

Method: 使用人机协作框架构建数据集：教师模型基于理论指导的提示提供候选标注，训练有素的人类专家验证和修正标注。

Result: 测试多种开源VideoLLMs发现：1)模型在规范违反检测上表现较差；2)对中国文化的理解不如美国文化；3)提供非言语证据比言语证据更困难；4)在正式、非幽默语境中表现不如人类。

Conclusion: 研究强调需要文化基础化的视频语言模型训练，VideoNorms基准和框架开始填补这一空白。

Abstract: As Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) are deployed globally, they
require understanding of and grounding in the relevant cultural background. To
properly assess these models' cultural awareness, adequate benchmarks are
needed. We introduce VideoNorms, a benchmark of over 1000 (video clip, norm)
pairs from US and Chinese cultures annotated with socio-cultural norms grounded
in speech act theory, norm adherence and violations labels, and verbal and
non-verbal evidence. To build VideoNorms, we use a human-AI collaboration
framework, where a teacher model using theoretically-grounded prompting
provides candidate annotations and a set of trained human experts validate and
correct the annotations. We benchmark a variety of open-weight VideoLLMs on the
new dataset which highlight several common trends: 1) models performs worse on
norm violation than adherence; 2) models perform worse w.r.t Chinese culture
compared to the US culture; 3) models have more difficulty in providing
non-verbal evidence compared to verbal for the norm adhere/violation label and
struggle to identify the exact norm corresponding to a speech-act; and 4)
unlike humans, models perform worse in formal, non-humorous contexts. Our
findings emphasize the need for culturally-grounded video language model
training - a gap our benchmark and framework begin to address.

TL;DR: ARTDECO是一个统一的3D重建框架，结合了前馈模型的高效性和SLAM管道的可靠性，通过3D基础模型进行位姿估计和点预测，使用高斯解码器将多尺度特征转换为结构化3D高斯，实现交互式性能和高保真重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单目图像序列实时3D重建的挑战，现有方法存在保真度与计算效率的权衡：逐场景优化保真度高但计算昂贵，前馈基础模型实时但精度和鲁棒性不足。

Method: 使用3D基础模型进行位姿估计和点预测，结合高斯解码器将多尺度特征转换为结构化3D高斯，设计分层高斯表示和LoD感知渲染策略以提高渲染保真度并减少冗余。

Result: 在8个不同的室内外基准测试中，ARTDECO实现了与SLAM相当的交互性能，与前馈系统相似的鲁棒性，以及接近逐场景优化的重建质量。

Conclusion: ARTDECO为实时数字化真实世界环境提供了一条实用路径，兼具准确几何和高视觉保真度。

Abstract: On-the-fly 3D reconstruction from monocular image sequences is a
long-standing challenge in computer vision, critical for applications such as
real-to-sim, AR/VR, and robotics. Existing methods face a major tradeoff:
per-scene optimization yields high fidelity but is computationally expensive,
whereas feed-forward foundation models enable real-time inference but struggle
with accuracy and robustness. In this work, we propose ARTDECO, a unified
framework that combines the efficiency of feed-forward models with the
reliability of SLAM-based pipelines. ARTDECO uses 3D foundation models for pose
estimation and point prediction, coupled with a Gaussian decoder that
transforms multi-scale features into structured 3D Gaussians. To sustain both
fidelity and efficiency at scale, we design a hierarchical Gaussian
representation with a LoD-aware rendering strategy, which improves rendering
fidelity while reducing redundancy. Experiments on eight diverse indoor and
outdoor benchmarks show that ARTDECO delivers interactive performance
comparable to SLAM, robustness similar to feed-forward systems, and
reconstruction quality close to per-scene optimization, providing a practical
path toward on-the-fly digitization of real-world environments with both
accurate geometry and high visual fidelity. Explore more demos on our project

TL;DR: VideoCanvas是一个零参数新增的视频生成框架，通过解耦时空控制实现任意时空视频补全，统一了图像到视频、修复、扩展和插值等任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现代潜在视频扩散模型中因果VAE引入的时间模糊性问题，实现像素级帧感知的精确控制，统一多种可控视频生成任务。

Method: 采用混合条件策略：空间控制通过零填充处理，时间对齐通过时间RoPE插值实现，为每个条件分配连续分数位置，解决VAE的时间模糊性。

Result: 在VideoCanvasBench基准测试中显著优于现有条件范式，在帧内保真度和场景间创造力方面建立新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: VideoCanvas为零参数新增的灵活统一视频生成设立了新标准，成功解决了潜在视频扩散模型中的时间模糊性问题。

Abstract: We introduce the task of arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, where a
video is generated from arbitrary, user-specified patches placed at any spatial
location and timestamp, akin to painting on a video canvas. This flexible
formulation naturally unifies many existing controllable video generation
tasks--including first-frame image-to-video, inpainting, extension, and
interpolation--under a single, cohesive paradigm. Realizing this vision,
however, faces a fundamental obstacle in modern latent video diffusion models:
the temporal ambiguity introduced by causal VAEs, where multiple pixel frames
are compressed into a single latent representation, making precise frame-level
conditioning structurally difficult. We address this challenge with
VideoCanvas, a novel framework that adapts the In-Context Conditioning (ICC)
paradigm to this fine-grained control task with zero new parameters. We propose
a hybrid conditioning strategy that decouples spatial and temporal control:
spatial placement is handled via zero-padding, while temporal alignment is
achieved through Temporal RoPE Interpolation, which assigns each condition a
continuous fractional position within the latent sequence. This resolves the
VAE's temporal ambiguity and enables pixel-frame-aware control on a frozen
backbone. To evaluate this new capability, we develop VideoCanvasBench, the
first benchmark for arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, covering both
intra-scene fidelity and inter-scene creativity. Experiments demonstrate that
VideoCanvas significantly outperforms existing conditioning paradigms,
establishing a new state of the art in flexible and unified video generation.

Motivation: 当前视频基准主要针对通用场景，依赖感知/识别能力而推理任务相对简单，无法有效评估先进的多模态认知技能，特别是在科学领域的复杂视频推理仍是一个重大挑战。

Method: 构建了包含1000个多选题的SciVideoBench基准，问题源自25+专业学科的前沿科学实验视频，通过半自动系统验证，要求领域专业知识、精确时空感知和复杂逻辑推理。

Result: 评估显示最先进的专有和开源LMMs（包括Gemini 2.5 Pro和Qwen2.5-VL）存在显著性能缺陷，表明视频推理能力仍有很大提升空间。

Conclusion: SciVideoBench为LMMs的未来发展提供了宝贵见解和明确方向，推动真正有能力多模态AI共同科学家的演进，帮助推动前沿AI在更广泛科学领域的边界。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress across
various capabilities; however, complex video reasoning in the scientific domain
remains a significant and challenging frontier. Current video benchmarks
predominantly target general scenarios where perception/recognition is heavily
relied on, while with relatively simple reasoning tasks, leading to saturation
and thus failing to effectively evaluate advanced multimodal cognitive skills.
To address this critical gap, we introduce SciVideoBench, a rigorous benchmark
specifically designed to assess advanced video reasoning in scientific
contexts. SciVideoBench consists of 1,000 carefully crafted multiple-choice
questions derived from cutting-edge scientific experimental videos spanning
over 25 specialized academic subjects and verified by a semi-automatic system.
Each question demands sophisticated domain-specific knowledge, precise
spatiotemporal perception, and intricate logical reasoning, effectively
challenging models' higher-order cognitive abilities. Our evaluation highlights
significant performance deficits in state-of-the-art proprietary and
open-source LMMs, including Gemini 2.5 Pro and Qwen2.5-VL, indicating
substantial room for advancement in video reasoning capabilities. Detailed
analyses of critical factors such as reasoning complexity and visual grounding
provide valuable insights and clear direction for future developments in LMMs,
driving the evolution of truly capable multimodal AI co-scientists. We hope
SciVideoBench could fit the interests of the community and help to push the
boundary of cutting-edge AI for border science.

Motivation: 现有视频插帧方法无法生成复杂大运动，缺乏用户意图的多样性和对中间帧细节的精细控制，无法满足创作需求

Method: 采用Diffusion Transformer架构，将运动控制映射为稀疏点表示，分离内容和运动控制为双分支，采用分阶段训练策略

Conclusion: 提出的框架在灵活性、易用性和精确性之间取得了平衡，为视频编辑和长视频合成提供了强大的多模态控制能力

Abstract: Video inbetweening creates smooth and natural transitions between two image
frames, making it an indispensable tool for video editing and long-form video
synthesis. Existing works in this domain are unable to generate large, complex,
or intricate motions. In particular, they cannot accommodate the versatility of
user intents and generally lack fine control over the details of intermediate
frames, leading to misalignment with the creative mind. To fill these gaps, we
introduce \modelname{}, a video inbetweening framework that allows multi-modal
controls, including depth transition and layering, motion trajectories, text
prompts, and target regions for movement localization, while achieving a
balance between flexibility, ease of use, and precision for fine-grained video
interpolation. To achieve this, we adopt the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)
architecture as our video generative model, due to its proven capability to
generate high-quality long videos. To ensure compatibility between DiT and our
multi-modal controls, we map all motion controls into a common sparse and
user-friendly point-based representation as the video/noise input. Further, to
respect the variety of controls which operate at varying levels of granularity
and influence, we separate content controls and motion controls into two
branches to encode the required features before guiding the denoising process,
resulting in two generators, one for motion and the other for content. Finally,
we propose a stage-wise training strategy to ensure that our model learns the
multi-modal controls smoothly. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments demonstrate that multi-modal controls enable a more dynamic,
customizable, and contextually accurate visual narrative.

Motivation: 现有MLLMs通常采用组合式训练范式，将预训练视觉编码器与预训练LLMs连接，但这种分离训练方式难以探索多模态缩放特性。

Method: 系统研究端到端原生MLLM的设计空间和缩放特性，在数据约束的实用设置下，探索各种选择以获得最佳元架构，并提出简单有效的训练方案。

Result: 在14个多模态基准测试中，NaViL展现出与现有MLLMs竞争的性能，并揭示了视觉编码器与LLMs之间的正相关缩放关系。

Conclusion: 研究结果为未来原生MLLMs的研究提供了深入见解，证明了端到端原生训练的有效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Compositional training has been the de-facto paradigm in existing Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs), where pre-trained vision encoders are connected
with pre-trained LLMs through continuous multimodal pre-training. However, the
multimodal scaling property of this paradigm remains difficult to explore due
to the separated training. In this paper, we focus on the native training of
MLLMs in an end-to-end manner and systematically study its design space and
scaling property under a practical setting, i.e., data constraint. Through
careful study of various choices in MLLM, we obtain the optimal
meta-architecture that best balances performance and training cost. After that,
we further explore the scaling properties of the native MLLM and indicate the
positively correlated scaling relationship between visual encoders and LLMs.
Based on these findings, we propose a native MLLM called NaViL, combined with a
simple and cost-effective recipe. Experimental results on 14 multimodal
benchmarks confirm the competitive performance of NaViL against existing MLLMs.
Besides that, our findings and results provide in-depth insights for the future
study of native MLLMs.

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在稀疏视图条件下显著提升了视觉质量和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: D²GS框架有效解决了稀疏视图下3D高斯泼溅的过拟合和欠拟合问题，为稀疏视图条件下的3D重建提供了更稳定和高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enable real-time,
high-fidelity novel view synthesis (NVS) with explicit 3D representations.
However, performance degradation and instability remain significant under
sparse-view conditions. In this work, we identify two key failure modes under
sparse-view conditions: overfitting in regions with excessive Gaussian density
near the camera, and underfitting in distant areas with insufficient Gaussian
coverage. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework D$^2$GS,
comprising two key components: a Depth-and-Density Guided Dropout strategy that
suppresses overfitting by adaptively masking redundant Gaussians based on
density and depth, and a Distance-Aware Fidelity Enhancement module that
improves reconstruction quality in under-fitted far-field areas through
targeted supervision. Moreover, we introduce a new evaluation metric to
quantify the stability of learned Gaussian distributions, providing insights
into the robustness of the sparse-view 3DGS. Extensive experiments on multiple
datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves both visual quality
and robustness under sparse view conditions. The project page can be found at:

Conclusion: 该框架能够自动生成高质量多模态数据，显著提升VLM控制器的工具使用推理能力，为多模态智能体发展提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed as controllers with
access to external tools for complex reasoning and decision-making, yet their
effectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal
trajectories and the cost of manual annotation. We address this challenge with
a vision-centric agent tuning framework that automatically synthesizes
multimodal trajectories, generates step-wise preference pairs, and trains a VLM
controller for robust tool-use reasoning. Our pipeline first constructs
M-TRACE, a large-scale dataset of 28.5K multimodal tasks with 177K verified
trajectories, enabling imitation-based trajectory tuning. Building on this, we
develop MATRIX Agent, a controller finetuned on M-TRACE for step-wise tool
reasoning. To achieve finer alignment, we further introduce Pref-X, a set of
11K automatically generated preference pairs, and optimize MATRIX on it via
step-wise preference learning. Across three benchmarks, Agent-X, GTA, and GAIA,
MATRIX consistently surpasses both open- and closed-source VLMs, demonstrating
scalable and effective multimodal tool use. Our data and code is avaliable at

TL;DR: ReSplat是一种前馈循环高斯泼溅模型，通过迭代细化3D高斯而不显式计算梯度，利用渲染误差作为反馈信号指导高斯更新，在减少高斯数量和提升渲染速度的同时实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统前馈高斯泼溅模型依赖单次前向推理，性能受限于此。需要一种能够迭代优化3D高斯表示的方法，同时保持计算效率。

Method: 提出循环高斯泼溅模型，使用渲染误差作为反馈信号指导高斯更新；引入紧凑重建模型在16倍下采样空间初始化，生成比先前方法少16倍的高斯；实现无需显式梯度的迭代优化。

Result: 在多种输入视图(2,8,16)、分辨率(256×256到540×960)和数据集(DL3DV、RealEstate10K)上的实验表明，该方法达到最先进性能，同时显著减少高斯数量并提升渲染速度。

Conclusion: ReSplat通过循环反馈机制和紧凑初始化策略，在保持计算效率的同时实现了对3D高斯表示的迭代优化，为稀疏输入设置下的3D重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: While feed-forward Gaussian splatting models provide computational efficiency
and effectively handle sparse input settings, their performance is
fundamentally limited by the reliance on a single forward pass during
inference. We propose ReSplat, a feed-forward recurrent Gaussian splatting
model that iteratively refines 3D Gaussians without explicitly computing
gradients. Our key insight is that the Gaussian splatting rendering error
serves as a rich feedback signal, guiding the recurrent network to learn
effective Gaussian updates. This feedback signal naturally adapts to unseen
data distributions at test time, enabling robust generalization. To initialize
the recurrent process, we introduce a compact reconstruction model that
operates in a $16 \times$ subsampled space, producing $16 \times$ fewer
Gaussians than previous per-pixel Gaussian models. This substantially reduces
computational overhead and allows for efficient Gaussian updates. Extensive
experiments across varying of input views (2, 8, 16), resolutions ($256 \times
256$ to $540 \times 960$), and datasets (DL3DV and RealEstate10K) demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly
reducing the number of Gaussians and improving the rendering speed. Our project

Abstract: Accurate modeling of spatial acoustics is critical for immersive and
intelligible audio in confined, resonant environments such as car cabins.
Current tuning methods are manual, hardware-intensive, and static, failing to
account for frequency selective behaviors and dynamic changes like passenger
presence or seat adjustments. To address this issue, we propose INFER: Implicit
Neural Frequency Response fields, a frequency-domain neural framework that is
jointly conditioned on source and receiver positions, orientations to directly
learn complex-valued frequency response fields inside confined, resonant
environments like car cabins. We introduce three key innovations over current
neural acoustic modeling methods: (1) novel end-to-end frequency-domain forward
model that directly learns the frequency response field and frequency-specific
attenuation in 3D space; (2) perceptual and hardware-aware spectral supervision
that emphasizes critical auditory frequency bands and deemphasizes unstable
crossover regions; and (3) a physics-based Kramers-Kronig consistency
constraint that regularizes frequency-dependent attenuation and delay. We
evaluate our method over real-world data collected in multiple car cabins. Our
approach significantly outperforms time- and hybrid-domain baselines on both
simulated and real-world automotive datasets, cutting average magnitude and
phase reconstruction errors by over 39% and 51%, respectively. INFER sets a new
state-of-the-art for neural acoustic modeling in automotive spaces

Motivation: 当前音乐源分离方法依赖监督学习，受限于训练数据的数量和质量。网页爬取可获得丰富数据，但平台级音轨标注常导致元数据不匹配，阻碍准确获取"音频-标签"对。

Method: 通过网页爬取大量原始数据，构建基于预训练音频编码器的乐器分类器来自动清洗数据，过滤和聚合目标乐器的干净片段，生成ACMID-Cleaned数据集，并将分类从4音轨扩展到7音轨。

Result: 实验表明：使用ACMID-Cleaned训练的模型比使用ACMID-Uncleaned的SDR性能提升2.39dB；将ACMID-Cleaned加入训练可使模型平均性能提升1.16dB。

Conclusion: ACMID数据集及其自动清洗方法有效解决了音乐源分离中的数据质量问题，显著提升了分离性能，为高粒度音乐源分离系统提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Most current music source separation (MSS) methods rely on supervised
learning, limited by training data quantity and quality. Though web-crawling
can bring abundant data, platform-level track labeling often causes metadata
mismatches, impeding accurate "audio-label" pair acquisition. To address this,
we present ACMID: a dataset for MSS generated through web crawling of extensive
raw data, followed by automatic cleaning via an instrument classifier built on
a pre-trained audio encoder that filters and aggregates clean segments of
target instruments from the crawled tracks, resulting in the refined
ACMID-Cleaned dataset. Leveraging abundant data, we expand the conventional
classification from 4-stem (Vocal/Bass/Drums/Others) to 7-stem
(Piano/Drums/Bass/Acoustic Guitar/Electric Guitar/Strings/Wind-Brass), enabling
high granularity MSS systems. Experiments on SOTA MSS model demonstrates two
key results: (i) MSS model trained with ACMID-Cleaned achieved a 2.39dB
improvement in SDR performance compared to that with ACMID-Uncleaned,
demostrating the effectiveness of our data cleaning procedure; (ii)
incorporating ACMID-Cleaned to training enhances MSS model's average
performance by 1.16dB, confirming the value of our dataset. Our data crawling

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: IntMeanFlow 是一个用于少步语音生成的框架，通过积分速度蒸馏方法，在保持高质量合成的同时实现了1-NFE的token-to-spectrogram和3-NFE的text-to-spectrogram推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于流的生成模型在文本到语音合成中质量很好，但推理速度受限于迭代采样过程和多次函数评估。MeanFlow模型通过建模平均速度来加速生成，但在TTS应用中面临GPU内存开销和训练不稳定的问题。

Method: 提出了IntMeanFlow框架，通过用教师模型的瞬时速度在时间区间上的积分来近似平均速度，消除了Jacobian-vector products的需求和自引导过程。还提出了最优步长采样搜索算法来识别模型特定的最优采样步数。

Result: 实验表明，IntMeanFlow在token-to-spectrogram任务中实现了1-NFE推理，在text-to-spectrogram任务中实现了3-NFE推理，同时保持了高质量的语音合成。

Conclusion: IntMeanFlow成功解决了MeanFlow在TTS应用中的内存开销和训练稳定性问题，实现了高效的少步语音生成，为实时TTS系统提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Flow-based generative models have greatly improved text-to-speech (TTS)
synthesis quality, but inference speed remains limited by the iterative
sampling process and multiple function evaluations (NFE). The recent MeanFlow
model accelerates generation by modeling average velocity instead of
instantaneous velocity. However, its direct application to TTS encounters
challenges, including GPU memory overhead from Jacobian-vector products (JVP)
and training instability due to self-bootstrap processes. To address these
issues, we introduce IntMeanFlow, a framework for few-step speech generation
with integral velocity distillation. By approximating average velocity with the
teacher's instantaneous velocity over a temporal interval, IntMeanFlow
eliminates the need for JVPs and self-bootstrap, improving stability and
reducing GPU memory usage. We also propose the Optimal Step Sampling Search
(O3S) algorithm, which identifies the model-specific optimal sampling steps,
improving speech synthesis without additional inference overhead. Experiments
show that IntMeanFlow achieves 1-NFE inference for token-to-spectrogram and
3-NFE for text-to-spectrogram tasks while maintaining high-quality synthesis.

Abstract: This paper presents our solution to the Multimodal Personality-aware
Depression Detection (MPDD) challenge at ACM MM 2025. We propose a multimodal
depression detection model in the Elderly that incorporates personality
characteristics. We introduce a multi-feature fusion approach based on a
co-attention mechanism to effectively integrate LLDs, MFCCs, and Wav2Vec
features in the audio modality. For the video modality, we combine
representations extracted from OpenFace, ResNet, and DenseNet to construct a
comprehensive visual feature set. Recognizing the critical role of personality
in depression detection, we design an interaction module that captures the
relationships between personality traits and multimodal features. Experimental
results from the MPDD Elderly Depression Detection track demonstrate that our
method significantly enhances performance, providing valuable insights for
future research in multimodal depression detection among elderly populations.

Abstract: The rise of AI-generated music is diluting royalty pools and revealing
structural flaws in existing remuneration frameworks, challenging the
well-established artist compensation systems in the music industry. Existing
compensation solutions, such as piecemeal licensing agreements, lack
scalability and technical rigour, while current data attribution mechanisms
provide only uncertain estimates and are rarely implemented in practice. This
paper introduces a framework for a generative music infrastructure centred on
direct attribution, transparent royalty distribution, and granular control for
artists and rights' holders. We distinguish ontologically between the training
set and the inference set, which allows us to propose two complementary forms
of attribution: training-time attribution and inference-time attribution. We
here favour inference-time attribution, as it enables direct, verifiable
compensation whenever an artist's catalogue is used to condition a generated
output. Besides, users benefit from the ability to condition generations on
specific songs and receive transparent information about attribution and
permitted usage. Our approach offers an ethical and practical solution to the
pressing need for robust compensation mechanisms in the era of AI-generated
music, ensuring that provenance and fairness are embedded at the core of
generative systems.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了视频到音频生成中的插入幻觉问题，开发了系统评估框架和两个新指标来量化该问题，并提出了一种无需训练的后验特征校正方法来缓解插入幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频到音频生成模型的评估指标只关注语义和时间对齐，但忽略了模型经常生成没有对应视觉源的声学事件（特别是语音和音乐）这一关键失败模式，即插入幻觉问题。

Method: 首先开发了基于多数投票集成多个音频事件检测器的系统评估框架，提出了IH@vid和IH@dur两个新指标。然后提出了后验特征校正方法，采用两阶段过程：首先生成初始音频输出检测幻觉片段，然后在对应时间戳屏蔽视频特征后重新生成音频。

Result: 实验显示最先进的V2A模型存在严重的插入幻觉问题。PFC方法将幻觉的普遍性和持续时间平均减少了50%以上，且不降低甚至在某些情况下改进了音频质量和时间同步的传统指标。

Conclusion: 这是首次正式定义、系统测量并有效缓解插入幻觉问题的工作，为开发更可靠和忠实的V2A模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: Video-to-Audio generation has made remarkable strides in automatically
synthesizing sound for video. However, existing evaluation metrics, which focus
on semantic and temporal alignment, overlook a critical failure mode: models
often generate acoustic events, particularly speech and music, that have no
corresponding visual source. We term this phenomenon Insertion Hallucination
and identify it as a systemic risk driven by dataset biases, such as the
prevalence of off-screen sounds, that remains completely undetected by current
metrics. To address this challenge, we first develop a systematic evaluation
framework that employs a majority-voting ensemble of multiple audio event
detectors. We also introduce two novel metrics to quantify the prevalence and
severity of this issue: IH@vid (the fraction of videos with hallucinations) and
IH@dur (the fraction of hallucinated duration). Building on this, we propose
Posterior Feature Correction, a novel training-free inference-time method that
mitigates IH. PFC operates in a two-pass process: it first generates an initial
audio output to detect hallucinated segments, and then regenerates the audio
after masking the corresponding video features at those timestamps. Experiments
on several mainstream V2A benchmarks first reveal that state-of-the-art models
suffer from severe IH. In contrast, our PFC method reduces both the prevalence
and duration of hallucinations by over 50\% on average, without degrading, and
in some cases even improving, conventional metrics for audio quality and
temporal synchronization. Our work is the first to formally define,
systematically measure, and effectively mitigate Insertion Hallucination,
paving the way for more reliable and faithful V2A models.

Abstract: Audio-based lyrics matching can be an appealing alternative to other

while also exploring multimodal extensions that integrate textual and acoustic

that WEALY achieves a performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods that
lack reproducibility. In addition, we provide ablation studies and analyses on

contributes a reliable benchmark for future research, and underscores the
potential of speech technologies for music information retrieval tasks.

Motivation: 多智能体强化学习面临非平稳性和部分可观测性的挑战，通信提供了解决方案，但关于其最优结构和评估方法仍存在问题。

Method: 探索通信拓扑结构和信息效率，引入信息熵效率指数(IEI)和专业化效率指数(SEI)两个指标，并将这些指标纳入训练目标。

Result: 定向和顺序拓扑在同类和异类任务中都能提高性能并减少通信开销，将IEI和SEI纳入训练目标能提高成功率和收敛速度。

Conclusion: 设计具有信息高效消息传递的自适应通信拓扑对于复杂多智能体系统中的有效协调至关重要。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) solve complex problems through coordinated
autonomous entities with individual decision-making capabilities. While
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) enables these agents to learn
intelligent strategies, it faces challenges of non-stationarity and partial
observability. Communications among agents offer a solution, but questions
remain about its optimal structure and evaluation. This paper explores two
underexamined aspects: communication topology and information efficiency. We
demonstrate that directed and sequential topologies improve performance while
reducing communication overhead across both homogeneous and heterogeneous
tasks. Additionally, we introduce two metrics -- Information Entropy Efficiency
Index (IEI) and Specialization Efficiency Index (SEI) -- to evaluate message
compactness and role differentiation. Incorporating these metrics into training
objectives improves success rates and convergence speed. Our findings highlight
that designing adaptive communication topologies with information-efficient
messaging is essential for effective coordination in complex MAS.

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder significantly influences the communication
abilities, learning processes, behavior, and social interactions of
individuals. Although early intervention and customized educational strategies
are critical to improving outcomes, there is a pivotal gap in understanding and
addressing nuanced behavioral patterns and emotional identification in autistic
children prior to skill development. This extended research delves into the
foundational step of recognizing and mapping these patterns as a prerequisite
to improving learning and soft skills. Using a longitudinal approach to monitor
emotions and behaviors, this study aims to establish a baseline understanding
of the unique needs and challenges faced by autistic students, particularly in
the Information Technology domain, where opportunities are markedly limited.
Through a detailed analysis of behavioral trends over time, we propose a
targeted framework for developing applications and technical aids designed to
meet these identified needs. Our research underscores the importance of a
sequential and evidence-based intervention approach that prioritizes a deep
understanding of each child's behavioral and emotional landscape as the basis
for effective skill development. By shifting the focus toward early
identification of behavioral patterns, we aim to foster a more inclusive and
supportive learning environment that can significantly improve the educational
and developmental trajectory of children with ASD.

Motivation: 软件漏洞共利用攻击对企业构成严重威胁，需要通过分析异构多模态漏洞数据来缓解。现有基于遗传算法的图神经网络架构搜索方法局限于单模态，忽略了模态异质性。

Method: 开发了模态感知协同进化框架，将全局染色体种群划分为模态特定基因组，由本地工作器独立进化，协调器重新组装染色体进行联合评估。引入模态感知双轨代理方法来降低评估成本，并设计基于相似性的种群多样性指标策略来平衡探索与利用。

Conclusion: MACC-MGNAS有效解决了多模态图神经网络架构搜索中的模态异质性挑战，显著提高了漏洞共利用攻击预测的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Co-exploitation attacks on software vulnerabilities pose severe risks to
enterprises, a threat that can be mitigated by analyzing heterogeneous and
multimodal vulnerability data. Multimodal graph neural networks (MGNNs) are
well-suited to integrate complementary signals across modalities, thereby
improving attack-prediction accuracy. However, designing an effective MGNN
architecture is challenging because it requires coordinating modality-specific
components at each layer, which is infeasible through manual tuning. Genetic
algorithm (GA)-based graph neural architecture search (GNAS) provides a natural
solution, yet existing methods are confined to single modalities and overlook
modality heterogeneity. To address this limitation, we propose a modality-aware
cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm for multimodal graph neural architecture
search, termed MACC-MGNAS. First, we develop a modality-aware cooperative
co-evolution (MACC) framework under a divide-and-conquer paradigm: a
coordinator partitions a global chromosome population into modality-specific
gene groups, local workers evolve them independently, and the coordinator
reassembles chromosomes for joint evaluation. This framework effectively
captures modality heterogeneity ignored by single-modality GNAS. Second, we
introduce a modality-aware dual-track surrogate (MADTS) method to reduce
evaluation cost and accelerate local gene evolution. Third, we design a
similarity-based population diversity indicator (SPDI) strategy to adaptively
balance exploration and exploitation, thereby accelerating convergence and
avoiding local optima. On a standard vulnerabilities co-exploitation (VulCE)
dataset, MACC-MGNAS achieves an F1-score of 81.67% within only 3 GPU-hours,
outperforming the state-of-the-art competitor by 8.7% F1 while reducing
computation cost by 27%.

Conclusion: MultiFair通过双层级梯度调制有效解决了多模态医疗分类中的不平衡学习和公平性问题，在多个数据集上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Medical decision systems increasingly rely on data from multiple sources to
ensure reliable and unbiased diagnosis. However, existing multimodal learning
models fail to achieve this goal because they often ignore two critical
challenges. First, various data modalities may learn unevenly, thereby
converging to a model biased towards certain modalities. Second, the model may
emphasize learning on certain demographic groups causing unfair performances.
The two aspects can influence each other, as different data modalities may
favor respective groups during optimization, leading to both imbalanced and
unfair multimodal learning. This paper proposes a novel approach called
MultiFair for multimodal medical classification, which addresses these
challenges with a dual-level gradient modulation process. MultiFair dynamically
modulates training gradients regarding the optimization direction and magnitude
at both data modality and group levels. We conduct extensive experiments on two
multimodal medical datasets with different demographic groups. The results show
that MultiFair outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal learning and fairness
learning methods.

Method: 使用预训练的循环神经网络架构作为CICERO-SCM气候模型的代理模型，在多智能体强化学习环境中直接集成该高效代理。

Conclusion: 该方法绕过了核心计算瓶颈而不牺牲策略保真度，使得在多气体动态和高保真气候响应下进行大规模多智能体气候政策实验成为可能。

Abstract: Climate policy studies require models that capture the combined effects of
multiple greenhouse gases on global temperature, but these models are
computationally expensive and difficult to embed in reinforcement learning. We
present a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that integrates a
high-fidelity, highly efficient climate surrogate directly in the environment
loop, enabling regional agents to learn climate policies under multi-gas
dynamics. As a proof of concept, we introduce a recurrent neural network
architecture pretrained on ($20{,}000$) multi-gas emission pathways to
surrogate the climate model CICERO-SCM. The surrogate model attains
near-simulator accuracy with global-mean temperature RMSE $\approx 0.0004
\mathrm{K}$ and approximately $1000\times$ faster one-step inference. When
substituted for the original simulator in a climate-policy MARL setting, it
accelerates end-to-end training by $>\!100\times$. We show that the surrogate
and simulator converge to the same optimal policies and propose a methodology
to assess this property in cases where using the simulator is intractable. Our
work allows to bypass the core computational bottleneck without sacrificing
policy fidelity, enabling large-scale multi-agent experiments across
alternative climate-policy regimes with multi-gas dynamics and high-fidelity
climate response.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候变化日益破坏农业系统，需要准确的作物产量预测来保障粮食安全。虽然深度学习模型在利用卫星和天气数据进行产量预测方面显示潜力，但其跨地理区域和年份的泛化能力（对实际部署至关重要）尚未得到充分测试。

Method: 使用覆盖2017-2022年1,200多个美国县的大规模CropNet数据集，在真实的OOD条件下对GNN-RNN和MMST-ViT两种最先进模型进行基准测试，采用跨七个USDA农场资源区域的留一聚类交叉验证和年度预测场景。

Result: GNN-RNN在跨区域转移中表现出优越的泛化能力，而MMST-ViT在域内表现良好但在OOD条件下急剧退化。Heartland和Northern Great Plains等区域转移稳定，而Prairie Gateway区域表现持续不佳。GNN-RNN训练速度比MMST-ViT快135倍。

Conclusion: 空间-时间对齐（而非模型复杂性或数据规模）是稳健泛化的关键，需要透明的OOD评估协议来确保公平可靠的气候感知农业预测。

Abstract: Climate change is increasingly disrupting agricultural systems, making
accurate crop yield forecasting essential for food security. While deep
learning models have shown promise in yield prediction using satellite and
weather data, their ability to generalize across geographic regions and years -
critical for real-world deployment - remains largely untested. We benchmark two
state-of-the-art models, GNN-RNN and MMST-ViT, under realistic
out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions using the large-scale CropNet dataset
spanning 1,200+ U.S. counties from 2017-2022. Through leave-one-cluster-out
cross-validation across seven USDA Farm Resource Regions and year-ahead
prediction scenarios, we identify substantial variability in cross-region
transferability. GNN-RNN demonstrates superior generalization with positive
correlations under geographic shifts, while MMST-ViT performs well in-domain
but degrades sharply under OOD conditions. Regions like Heartland and Northern
Great Plains show stable transfer dynamics (RMSE less than 10 bu/acre for
soybean), whereas Prairie Gateway exhibits persistent underperformance (RMSE
greater than 20 bu/acre) across both models and crops, revealing structural
dissimilarities likely driven by semi-arid climate, irrigation patterns, and
incomplete spectral coverage. Beyond accuracy differences, GNN-RNN achieves
135x faster training than MMST-ViT (14 minutes vs. 31.5 hours), making it more
viable for sustainable deployment. Our findings underscore that
spatial-temporal alignment - not merely model complexity or data scale - is key
to robust generalization, and highlight the need for transparent OOD evaluation
protocols to ensure equitable and reliable climate-aware agricultural
forecasting.

Conclusion: DUA-D2C是一个理论上有依据且有效的深度学习方法，能够有效对抗过拟合问题。

Abstract: Overfitting remains a significant challenge in deep learning, often arising
from data outliers, noise, and limited training data. To address this, the
Divide2Conquer (D2C) method was previously proposed, which partitions training
data into multiple subsets and trains identical models independently on each.
This strategy enables learning more consistent patterns while minimizing the
influence of individual outliers and noise. However, D2C's standard aggregation
typically treats all subset models equally or based on fixed heuristics (like
data size), potentially underutilizing information about their varying
generalization capabilities. Building upon this foundation, we introduce
Dynamic Uncertainty-Aware Divide2Conquer (DUA-D2C), an advanced technique that
refines the aggregation process. DUA-D2C dynamically weights the contributions
of subset models based on their performance on a shared validation set,
considering both accuracy and prediction uncertainty. This intelligent
aggregation allows the central model to preferentially learn from subsets
yielding more generalizable and confident edge models, thereby more effectively
combating overfitting. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets spanning
multiple domains demonstrate that DUA-D2C significantly improves
generalization. Our analysis includes evaluations of decision boundaries, loss
curves, and other performance metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of
DUA-D2C. This study demonstrates that DUA-D2C improves generalization
performance even when applied on top of other regularization methods,
establishing it as a theoretically grounded and effective approach to combating
overfitting in modern deep learning. Our codes are publicly available at:

TL;DR: 该论文研究学习智能体如何最优地整合专家数据，提出在贝叶斯多臂老虎机框架下分析专家数据价值的信息理论方法，包括离线预训练和同时学习两种设置，并开发了信息导向的学习规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着复杂学习智能体越来越多地与现有专家（如人类操作员或已训练智能体）共同部署，需要解决如何最优地整合与学习者自身经验结构不同的专家数据的问题。

Method: 在贝叶斯多臂老虎机框架下研究两种设置：(i)离线设置：学习者在交互前接收专家最优策略的结果数据集；(ii)同时设置：学习者需在每一步选择基于自身经验还是专家同时获得的结果来更新信念。提出了信息导向规则，使学习者选择能最大化关于最优动作一步信息增益的数据源。

Result: 证明了在专家结果上预训练可以通过专家数据与最优动作之间的互信息来收紧信息理论遗憾界。提出了学习者推断何时信任专家、何时不信任的策略，以保护学习者免受专家无效或被破坏的情况。

Conclusion: 通过量化专家数据的价值，该框架为智能体智能地决定何时向他人学习提供了实用的信息理论算法。

Abstract: Complex learning agents are increasingly deployed alongside existing experts,
such as human operators or previously trained agents. However, it remains
unclear how should learners optimally incorporate certain forms of expert data,
which may differ in structure from the learner's own action-outcome
experiences. We study this problem in the context of Bayesian multi-armed
bandits, considering: (i) offline settings, where the learner receives a
dataset of outcomes from the expert's optimal policy before interaction, and
(ii) simultaneous settings, where the learner must choose at each step whether
to update its beliefs based on its own experience, or based on the outcome
simultaneously achieved by an expert. We formalize how expert data influences
the learner's posterior, and prove that pretraining on expert outcomes tightens
information-theoretic regret bounds by the mutual information between the
expert data and the optimal action. For the simultaneous setting, we propose an
information-directed rule where the learner processes the data source that
maximizes their one-step information gain about the optimal action. Finally, we
propose strategies for how the learner can infer when to trust the expert and
when not to, safeguarding the learner for the cases where the expert is
ineffective or compromised. By quantifying the value of expert data, our
framework provides practical, information-theoretic algorithms for agents to
intelligently decide when to learn from others.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个生成和筛选高质量CUDA内核的流程，构建了ConCuR数据集和KernelCoder模型，在KernelBench中显著优于现有最佳模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决内核生成任务中高质量数据稀缺的问题，因为大多数高质量内核是专有且不开源的，这阻碍了使用监督微调来对齐LLM到内核生成任务。

Method: 开发了一个生成和筛选带有推理轨迹的高质量CUDA内核的流程，构建ConCuR数据集，并训练KernelCoder模型。

Result: 在KernelBench设置中，模型显著优于现有最佳模型QwQ-32B，超越了所有开源内核生成微调模型以及前沿模型如DeepSeek-V3.1-Think和Claude-4-sonnet。

Conclusion: 平均推理长度可以作为评估内核生成任务难度的指标，所提出的观察、指标和数据收集流程有助于未来获得更好的内核生成数据。

Abstract: GPU kernel generation by LLMs has recently experienced rapid development,
leveraging test-time scaling and reinforcement learning techniques. However, a
key challenge for kernel generation is the scarcity of high-quality data, as
most high-quality kernels are proprietary and not open-source. This challenge
prevents us from leveraging supervised fine-tuning to align LLMs to the kernel
generation task. To address this challenge, we develop a pipeline that
generates and curates high-quality CUDA kernels with reasoning traces,
motivated by a critical observation that concise yet informative reasoning
traces result in robust generation of high-performance kernels. Using this
pipeline, we construct our dataset ConCuR and introduce our model KernelCoder,
which is the first model trained on a curated dataset consisting of PyTorch,
reasoning, and CUDA kernel pairs, to our knowledge. In the KernelBench setup,
our model achieves significant improvements over the existing top-performing
model, QwQ-32B, and outperforms all open-source models fine-tuned for kernel
generation, as well as frontier models such as DeepSeek-V3.1-Think and
Claude-4-sonnet. Finally, we show that the average reasoning length can serve
as a metric to assess the difficulty of kernel generation tasks. The
observations, metrics, and our data collection and curation pipeline can help
obtain better data in the kernel generation task in the future.

TL;DR: 本文首次研究基于LLM的智能体是否能够通过交互影响对手的学习动态，提出了ShapeLLM方法，在竞争性和合作性游戏中验证了LLM智能体能够成功引导对手走向可被利用的均衡或促进协调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM智能体在现实环境中的部署增加，多智能体交互不可避免。核心问题是LLM智能体能否像强化学习智能体一样，仅通过交互就能塑造学习动态并影响其他智能体的行为。

Method: 提出了ShapeLLM方法，这是针对基于transformer的智能体量身定制的无模型对手塑造方法的适配版本，解决了现有OS算法无法直接应用于LLM的问题。

Result: 在竞争性游戏（迭代囚徒困境、匹配便士和懦夫博弈）中，LLM智能体成功引导对手走向可被利用的均衡；在合作性游戏（迭代猎鹿博弈和合作版囚徒困境）中，促进了协调并提高了集体福利。

Conclusion: LLM智能体能够通过交互相互塑造，确立了对手塑造作为多智能体LLM研究的关键维度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as autonomous
agents in real-world environments. As these deployments scale, multi-agent
interactions become inevitable, making it essential to understand strategic
behavior in such systems. A central open question is whether LLM agents, like
reinforcement learning agents, can shape the learning dynamics and influence
the behavior of others through interaction alone. In this paper, we present the
first investigation of opponent shaping (OS) with LLM-based agents. Existing OS
algorithms cannot be directly applied to LLMs, as they require higher-order
derivatives, face scalability constraints, or depend on architectural
components that are absent in transformers. To address this gap, we introduce
ShapeLLM, an adaptation of model-free OS methods tailored for transformer-based
agents. Using ShapeLLM, we examine whether LLM agents can influence co-players'
learning dynamics across diverse game-theoretic environments. We demonstrate
that LLM agents can successfully guide opponents toward exploitable equilibria
in competitive games (Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, Matching Pennies, and
Chicken) and promote coordination and improve collective welfare in cooperative
games (Iterated Stag Hunt and a cooperative version of the Prisoner's Dilemma).
Our findings show that LLM agents can both shape and be shaped through
interaction, establishing opponent shaping as a key dimension of multi-agent
LLM research.

TL;DR: ETD方法通过训练模型在推理相关层上进行迭代，增强基础模型推理能力，无需改变架构或参数数量，在多个推理基准上取得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提升LLM推理能力的方法要么扩大模型规模，要么增加推理计算量。研究发现推理任务的关键计算集中在有限层中，因此提出更高效的方法。

Method: Encode-Think-Decode (ETD)方法，在训练阶段让模型在推理相关层上进行迭代，保持原始架构、参数和训练数据不变。

Result: 在17个推理基准上取得显著提升，OLMo-2 1B模型在GSM8K上相对准确率提升28.4%，在MATH上提升36%。

Conclusion: 递归潜在推理为增强LLM推理能力提供了一条简单有效的路径。

Abstract: Most efforts to improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) involve either scaling the number of parameters and the size of training
data, or scaling inference computation by letting models generate complex
chains of thought. Motivated by interpretability studies showing that the
crucial computation required for reasoning tasks is concentrated in a limited
range of layers, we introduce Encode-Think-Decode (ETD), a method that enhances
the reasoning capabilities of a base model by training it to iterate over a
small subset of reasoning-relevant layers during the mid-training stage. ETD
amplifies latent reasoning while preserving the original architecture,
parameter count, hyperparameters, and training data composition. When iterating
on the selected layers at inference time, ETD models yield substantial gains on
17 reasoning benchmarks, including +28.4% relative accuracy improvement on
GSM8K and +36% on MATH with the OLMo-2 1B Base model. We also explore an
adaptive depth strategy that adjusts the computation per input token. Our
results show that recursive latent reasoning offers a simple and effective path
to stronger LLM reasoning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于线性上下文老虎机问题的高效最佳两全（BOBW）算法，该问题允许付费观察损失，在对抗性设置中达到最小最大最优遗憾，在随机设置中保证多对数遗憾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究线性上下文老虎机问题中的付费观察场景，学习者可以选择支付固定成本来观察任何臂的损失，旨在设计一个既能处理对抗性环境又能利用随机性环境的高效算法。

Method: 基于跟随正则化领导者（FTRL）框架，结合通过矩阵几何重采样的高效估计器，设计了一个计算高效的最佳两全算法。

Result: 该算法在对抗性设置中实现了Θ(T^{2/3})的最小最大最优遗憾，同时在（损坏的）随机机制中保证了多对数遗憾。

Conclusion: 通过为"困难问题"设计BOBW算法，并使用针对所考虑设置量身定制的分析技术，成功开发了一个在两种环境下都表现良好的高效算法。

Abstract: We study the problem of linear contextual bandits with paid observations,
where at each round the learner selects an action in order to minimize its loss
in a given context, and can then decide to pay a fixed cost to observe the loss
of any arm. Building on the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader framework with
efficient estimators via Matrix Geometric Resampling, we introduce a
computationally efficient Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) algorithm for this
problem. We show that it achieves the minimax-optimal regret of
$\Theta(T^{2/3})$ in adversarial settings, while guaranteeing poly-logarithmic
regret in (corrupted) stochastic regimes. Our approach builds on the framework
from \cite{BOBWhardproblems} to design BOBW algorithms for ``hard problem'',
using analysis techniques tailored for the setting that we consider.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BaRP是一种基于上下文多臂老虎机框架的LLM路由方法，支持在线学习和偏好可调推理，在部署时无需完整反馈信息，显著优于离线路由器和最大LLM模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM路由系统大多依赖离线训练，需要所有候选模型的完整标签信息，这在真实部署中不可行，因为只能观察到所选模型的结果。需要一种能在部分反馈限制下训练的方法。

Method: 将LLM路由建模为上下文多臂老虎机问题，基于提示特征和用户偏好向量进行决策。训练时模拟在线反馈设置，适应每个新提示，不依赖完整的离线监督信息。

Result: 实验表明该方法持续优于强离线路由器至少12.46%，优于最大LLM至少2.45%，并且在未见任务上具有鲁棒泛化能力。

Conclusion: BaRP方法成功解决了LLM路由中的在线决策问题，在部分反馈限制下训练，支持部署时的性能/成本权衡调整，无需重新训练。

Abstract: Efficient use of large language models (LLMs) is critical for deployment at
scale: without adaptive routing, systems either overpay for strong models or
risk poor performance from weaker ones. Selecting the right LLM for each query
is fundamentally an online decision problem: models differ in strengths, prices
fluctuate, and users value accuracy and cost differently. Yet most routers are
trained offline with labels for all candidate models, an assumption that breaks
in deployment, where only the outcome of the chosen model is observed. We
bridge this gap with BaRP, a Bandit-feedback Routing with Preferences approach
that trains under the same partial-feedback restriction as deployment, while
supporting preference-tunable inference: operators can dial the
performance/cost trade-off at test time without retraining. Framed as a
contextual bandit over prompt features and a user preference vector, our method
simulates an online feedback setting during training and adapts its routing
decisions to each new prompt, rather than depending on full-information offline
supervision. Comprehensive experiments show that our method consistently
outperforms strong offline routers by at least 12.46% and the largest LLM by at
least 2.45%, and generalizes robustly for unseen tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一个参数无关的联邦时序差分学习算法，在马尔可夫数据下实现了最优的收敛速率，适用于异构环境下的联邦学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习中的时序差分方法在马尔可夫数据下需要依赖未知问题参数才能达到最优收敛速率，这在实际应用中存在限制。

Method: 采用双时间尺度的联邦时序差分学习结合Polyak-Ruppert平均方法，构建了参数无关的算法框架。

Result: 算法在平均奖励和折扣奖励设置下均能证明达到最优的O~(1/NT)收敛速率，其中N是智能体数量，T是迭代次数。

Conclusion: 该方法填补了联邦时序差分学习在马尔可夫数据下的理论空白，为异构环境下的联邦强化学习提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) can dramatically speed up reinforcement learning by
distributing exploration and training across multiple agents. It can guarantee
an optimal convergence rate that scales linearly in the number of agents, i.e.,
a rate of $\tilde{O}(1/(NT)),$ where $T$ is the iteration index and $N$ is the
number of agents. However, when the training samples arise from a Markov chain,
existing results on TD learning achieving this rate require the algorithm to
depend on unknown problem parameters. We close this gap by proposing a
two-timescale Federated Temporal Difference (FTD) learning with Polyak-Ruppert
averaging. Our method provably attains the optimal $\tilde{O}(1/NT)$ rate in
both average-reward and discounted settings--offering a parameter-free FTD
approach for Markovian data. Although our results are novel even in the
single-agent setting, they apply to the more realistic and challenging scenario
of FL with heterogeneous environments.

TL;DR: 提出MoGU框架，一种基于不确定性的混合专家模型，用于时间序列预测，通过高斯分布建模专家输出，实现预测和不确定性的联合量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE模型仅提供点估计，无法量化预测不确定性。MoGU旨在解决这一问题，为回归任务提供更可靠的预测和不确定性估计。

Method: 将每个专家输出建模为高斯分布，使用基于不确定性的门控机制替代传统输入门控，根据专家估计的方差确定其对最终预测的贡献。

Result: 在多个时间序列预测基准测试中，MoGU始终优于单专家模型和传统MoE设置，并提供与预测误差直接相关的良好量化不确定性。

Conclusion: MoGU通过不确定性门控机制成功提升了时间序列预测的准确性和可靠性，为回归任务提供了有效的混合专家解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Mixture-of-Gaussians with Uncertainty-based Gating (MoGU), a
novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework designed for regression tasks and
applied to time series forecasting. Unlike conventional MoEs that provide only
point estimates, MoGU models each expert's output as a Gaussian distribution.
This allows it to directly quantify both the forecast (the mean) and its
inherent uncertainty (variance). MoGU's core innovation is its
uncertainty-based gating mechanism, which replaces the traditional input-based
gating network by using each expert's estimated variance to determine its
contribution to the final prediction. Evaluated across diverse time series
forecasting benchmarks, MoGU consistently outperforms single-expert models and
traditional MoE setups. It also provides well-quantified, informative
uncertainties that directly correlate with prediction errors, enhancing
forecast reliability. Our code is available from:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分层数据在实证科学中普遍存在，通常使用混合效应回归分析。贝叶斯推断能估计不确定性但解析困难，需要昂贵的MCMC近似方法。

Method: 使用基于Transformer的神经网络模型metabeta，通过模拟数据集进行预训练，将计算负担从推理时间转移到预训练时间。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据上，metabeta达到与MCMC参数估计相当的稳定性能，但所需时间大幅减少。

Conclusion: metabeta为贝叶斯混合效应回归提供了高效的替代方案，显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Hierarchical data with multiple observations per group is ubiquitous in
empirical sciences and is often analyzed using mixed-effects regression. In
such models, Bayesian inference gives an estimate of uncertainty but is
analytically intractable and requires costly approximation using Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Neural posterior estimation shifts the bulk of
computation from inference time to pre-training time, amortizing over simulated
datasets with known ground truth targets. We propose metabeta, a
transformer-based neural network model for Bayesian mixed-effects regression.
Using simulated and real data, we show that it reaches stable and comparable
performance to MCMC-based parameter estimation at a fraction of the usually
required time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新材料设计需要特定性能，但随着设计变量增加，搜索空间呈指数增长，使得合成和验证每个材料的性能变得不切实际且耗时。传统机器学习方法在训练数据来自非均匀随机采样时表现不佳。

Method: 使用张量补全作为替代模型来加速材料设计，特别针对晶格结构的机械性能优化。

Result: 在偏置采样情况下，张量补全比高斯过程和XGBoost等经典方法表现更好，R²提高约5%。在均匀随机采样情况下，张量补全仍能提供可比较的性能。

Conclusion: 张量补全是加速材料设计的有效方法，特别是在训练数据存在采样偏置的情况下，优于传统机器学习方法。

Abstract: When designing new materials, it is often necessary to design a material with
specific desired properties. Unfortunately, as new design variables are added,
the search space grows exponentially, which makes synthesizing and validating
the properties of each material very impractical and time-consuming. In this
work, we focus on the design of optimal lattice structures with regard to
mechanical performance. Computational approaches, including the use of machine
learning (ML) methods, have shown improved success in accelerating materials
design. However, these ML methods are still lacking in scenarios when training
data (i.e. experimentally validated materials) come from a non-uniformly random
sampling across the design space. For example, an experimentalist might
synthesize and validate certain materials more frequently because of
convenience. For this reason, we suggest the use of tensor completion as a
surrogate model to accelerate the design of materials in these atypical
supervised learning scenarios. In our experiments, we show that tensor
completion is superior to classic ML methods such as Gaussian Process and
XGBoost with biased sampling of the search space, with around 5\% increased
$R^2$. Furthermore, tensor completion still gives comparable performance with a
uniformly random sampling of the entire search space.

Abstract: Lung cancer (LC) is the third most common cancer and the leading cause of
cancer deaths in the US. Although smoking is the primary risk factor, the
occurrence of LC in never-smokers and familial aggregation studies highlight a
genetic component. Genetic biomarkers identified through genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) are promising tools for assessing LC risk. We
introduce HEMERA (Human-Explainable Transformer Model for Estimating Lung
Cancer Risk using GWAS Data), a new framework that applies explainable
transformer-based deep learning to GWAS data of single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) for predicting LC risk. Unlike prior approaches, HEMERA directly
processes raw genotype data without clinical covariates, introducing additive
positional encodings, neural genotype embeddings, and refined variant
filtering. A post hoc explainability module based on Layer-wise Integrated
Gradients enables attribution of model predictions to specific SNPs, aligning
strongly with known LC risk loci. Trained on data from 27,254 Million Veteran
Program participants, HEMERA achieved >99% AUC (area under receiver
characteristics) score. These findings support transparent,
hypothesis-generating models for personalized LC risk assessment and early
intervention.

Abstract: Over the years, significant contributions have been made by the research and
industrial sectors to improve wearable devices towards the Internet of Wearable
Things (IoWT) paradigm. However, wearables are still facing several challenges.
Many stem from the limited battery power and insufficient computation resources
available on wearable devices. On the other hand, with the popularity of smart
wearables, there is a consistent increase in the development of new
computationally intensive and latency-critical applications. In such a context,
task offloading allows wearables to leverage the resources available on nearby
edge devices to enhance the overall user experience. This paper proposes a
framework for Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based task offloading in the IoWT. We
formulate the task offloading process considering the tradeoff between energy
consumption and task accomplishment time. Moreover, we model the task
offloading problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and utilize the
Q-learning technique to enable the wearable device to make optimal task
offloading decisions without prior knowledge. We evaluate the performance of
the proposed framework through extensive simulations for various applications
and system configurations conducted in the ns-3 network simulator. We also show
how varying the main system parameters of the Q-learning algorithm affects the
overall performance in terms of average task accomplishment time, average
energy consumption, and percentage of tasks offloaded.

Motivation: 解决实际场景中黑盒检测机器生成文本的挑战：评分模型可能与未知源模型不匹配，且对比生成成本高昂。

Method: 将surprisal量化为可解释状态，估计测试文本的状态转移矩阵，通过广义Jensen-Shannon差距比较测试转移与固定参考（人类vs机器）。

Result: 在多个数据集、源模型和场景下，SurpMark始终匹配或超越基线方法，实验证实统计量的渐近正态性。

Conclusion: 提出的离散化方法有效，SurpMark在实用约束下为机器生成文本检测提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: We study black-box detection of machine-generated text under practical
constraints: the scoring model (proxy LM) may mismatch the unknown source
model, and per-input contrastive generation is costly. We propose SurpMark, a
reference-based detector that summarizes a passage by the dynamics of its token
surprisals. SurpMark quantizes surprisals into interpretable states, estimates
a state-transition matrix for the test text, and scores it via a generalized
Jensen-Shannon (GJS) gap between the test transitions and two fixed references
(human vs. machine) built once from historical corpora. We prove a principled
discretization criterion and establish the asymptotic normality of the decision
statistic. Empirically, across multiple datasets, source models, and scenarios,
SurpMark consistently matches or surpasses baselines; our experiments
corroborate the statistic's asymptotic normality, and ablations validate the
effectiveness of the proposed discretization.

Motivation: 现有研究通常只关注孤立的攻击面或特定场景，缺乏对多智能体系统漏洞的整体理解，需要系统性的评估基准。

Method: 引入PEAR基准测试，专注于广泛采用的规划器-执行器结构，通过大量实验系统评估多智能体系统的效用和脆弱性。

Result: 发现弱规划器比弱执行器更严重影响任务性能；规划器的记忆模块至关重要，而执行器的记忆模块不影响性能；存在性能与鲁棒性的权衡；针对规划器的攻击特别有效。

Conclusion: 这些发现为增强多智能体系统鲁棒性提供了可行见解，并为多智能体环境中的原则性防御奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have emerged as a
powerful paradigm for tackling complex, multi-step tasks across diverse
domains. However, despite their impressive capabilities, MAS remain susceptible
to adversarial manipulation. Existing studies typically examine isolated attack
surfaces or specific scenarios, leaving a lack of holistic understanding of MAS
vulnerabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce PEAR, a benchmark for
systematically evaluating both the utility and vulnerability of
planner-executor MAS. While compatible with various MAS architectures, our
benchmark focuses on the planner-executor structure, which is a practical and
widely adopted design. Through extensive experiments, we find that (1) a weak
planner degrades overall clean task performance more severely than a weak

Abstract: This paper explores a multimodal co-training framework designed to enhance
model generalization in situations where labeled data is limited and
distribution shifts occur. We thoroughly examine the theoretical foundations of
this framework, deriving conditions under which the use of unlabeled data and
the promotion of agreement between classifiers for different modalities lead to
significant improvements in generalization. We also present a convergence
analysis that confirms the effectiveness of iterative co-training in reducing
classification errors. In addition, we establish a novel generalization bound
that, for the first time in a multimodal co-training context, decomposes and
quantifies the distinct advantages gained from leveraging unlabeled multimodal
data, promoting inter-view agreement, and maintaining conditional view
independence. Our findings highlight the practical benefits of multimodal
co-training as a structured approach to developing data-efficient and robust AI
systems that can effectively generalize in dynamic, real-world environments.
The theoretical foundations are examined in dialogue with, and in advance of,
established co-training principles.

Motivation: 揭示多语言对话中的主题模式及其与用户偏好的关系，探索特定LLM是否在特定主题上持续获得偏好，为领域特定优化提供依据。

Method: 设计多语言预处理流程，使用BERTopic提取主题，通过可视化技术（主题距离图、概率分布、模型-主题矩阵）分析主题与模型偏好的关系。

Result: 提取了29个连贯主题（如AI、编程、伦理、云基础设施），发现了主题与模型偏好之间的关联模式，特定模型在某些主题上表现更优。

Conclusion: 研究结果为改进LLM在实际应用中的性能和用户满意度提供了领域特定微调和优化策略的指导。

Abstract: This study applies BERTopic, a transformer-based topic modeling technique, to
the lmsys-chat-1m dataset, a multilingual conversational corpus built from
head-to-head evaluations of large language models (LLMs). Each user prompt is
paired with two anonymized LLM responses and a human preference label, used to
assess user evaluation of competing model outputs. The main objective is
uncovering thematic patterns in these conversations and examining their
relation to user preferences, particularly if certain LLMs are consistently
preferred within specific topics. A robust preprocessing pipeline was designed
for multilingual variation, balancing dialogue turns, and cleaning noisy or
redacted data. BERTopic extracted over 29 coherent topics including artificial
intelligence, programming, ethics, and cloud infrastructure. We analysed
relationships between topics and model preferences to identify trends in
model-topic alignment. Visualization techniques included inter-topic distance
maps, topic probability distributions, and model-versus-topic matrices. Our
findings inform domain-specific fine-tuning and optimization strategies for
improving real-world LLM performance and user satisfaction.

TL;DR: MLLM4TS是一个利用多模态大语言模型进行时间序列分析的框架，通过视觉表示增强对复杂时间依赖和跨通道交互的理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列分析面临复杂时间依赖和跨通道交互的挑战，受人类视觉检查时间序列的启发，探索视觉表示是否能增强自动化分析。

Method: 将每个时间序列通道渲染为水平堆叠的彩色线图，使用时间感知视觉块对齐策略，融合数值数据的细粒度时间细节和视觉表示的全局上下文信息。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，MLLM4TS在预测任务（如分类）和生成任务（如异常检测和预测）中都表现出有效性。

Conclusion: 将视觉模态与预训练语言模型结合，有望实现稳健且可泛化的时间序列分析。

Abstract: Effective analysis of time series data presents significant challenges due to
the complex temporal dependencies and cross-channel interactions in
multivariate data. Inspired by the way human analysts visually inspect time
series to uncover hidden patterns, we ask: can incorporating visual
representations enhance automated time-series analysis? Recent advances in
multimodal large language models have demonstrated impressive generalization
and visual understanding capability, yet their application to time series
remains constrained by the modality gap between continuous numerical data and
discrete natural language. To bridge this gap, we introduce MLLM4TS, a novel
framework that leverages multimodal large language models for general
time-series analysis by integrating a dedicated vision branch. Each time-series
channel is rendered as a horizontally stacked color-coded line plot in one
composite image to capture spatial dependencies across channels, and a
temporal-aware visual patch alignment strategy then aligns visual patches with
their corresponding time segments. MLLM4TS fuses fine-grained temporal details
from the numerical data with global contextual information derived from the
visual representation, providing a unified foundation for multimodal
time-series analysis. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
the effectiveness of MLLM4TS across both predictive tasks (e.g.,
classification) and generative tasks (e.g., anomaly detection and forecasting).
These results underscore the potential of integrating visual modalities with
pretrained language models to achieve robust and generalizable time-series
analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确分类睡眠阶段对睡眠障碍诊断至关重要，传统方法依赖人工标注或EEG信号的时域/频域特征，需要更自动化和准确的方法。

Method: 使用连续小波变换生成时频图捕捉睡眠分期的瞬态和振荡模式，结合集成学习方法进行分类。

Result: 在Sleep-EDF数据库上达到88.37%总体准确率和73.15宏平均F1分数，优于传统机器学习方法，与深度学习方法性能相当或更优。

Conclusion: 小波分析为稳健、可解释且临床适用的睡眠阶段分类提供了潜力。

Abstract: Accurate classification of sleep stages is crucial for the diagnosis and
management of sleep disorders. Conventional approaches for sleep scoring rely
on manual annotation or features extracted from EEG signals in the time or
frequency domain. This study proposes a novel framework for automated sleep
stage scoring using time-frequency analysis based on the wavelet transform. The
Sleep-EDF Expanded Database (sleep-cassette recordings) was used for
evaluation. The continuous wavelet transform (CWT) generated time-frequency
maps that capture both transient and oscillatory patterns across frequency
bands relevant to sleep staging. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed wavelet-based representation, combined with ensemble learning,
achieves an overall accuracy of 88.37 percent and a macro-averaged F1 score of
73.15, outperforming conventional machine learning methods and exhibiting
comparable or superior performance to recent deep learning approaches. These
findings highlight the potential of wavelet analysis for robust, interpretable,
and clinically applicable sleep stage classification.

Result: LNN在处理噪声和非平稳数据方面表现出色，具有更好的OOD泛化能力，某些LNN变体在参数效率和计算速度上优于传统RNN。但RNN因其成熟的生态系统和广泛成功应用仍是序列建模的基石。

Conclusion: LNNs在特定场景下具有优势，但需要改进可扩展性以应用于更广泛复杂的场景。未来研究应关注LNNs的可扩展性提升，同时继续发挥RNNs在成熟应用中的价值。

Abstract: This review aims to conduct a comparative analysis of liquid neural networks
(LNNs) and traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their variants,
such as long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) and gated recurrent units
(GRUs). The core dimensions of the analysis include model accuracy, memory
efficiency, and generalization ability. By systematically reviewing existing
research, this paper explores the basic principles, mathematical models, key
characteristics, and inherent challenges of these neural network architectures
in processing sequential data. Research findings reveal that LNN, as an
emerging, biologically inspired, continuous-time dynamic neural network,
demonstrates significant potential in handling noisy, non-stationary data, and
achieving out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Additionally, some LNN
variants outperform traditional RNN in terms of parameter efficiency and
computational speed. However, RNN remains a cornerstone in sequence modeling
due to its mature ecosystem and successful applications across various tasks.
This review identifies the commonalities and differences between LNNs and RNNs,
summarizes their respective shortcomings and challenges, and points out
valuable directions for future research, particularly emphasizing the
importance of improving the scalability of LNNs to promote their application in
broader and more complex scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了FairSpecTemp方法，从图平稳节点观测中估计公平图，确保连接不偏向敏感属性。该方法通过谱域约束来促进图公平性，在保持准确性的同时实现公平图恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界图中的边往往表现出对某些群体对的连接偏好，这种有偏连接会加剧甚至引发下游图任务的歧视性处理。因此需要确保图的连接不偏向敏感属性。

Method: 提出了Fair Spectral Templates (FairSpecTemp)方法，包含两种变体：一种利用图平稳性的交换性质直接约束偏差，另一种通过限制图谱中的偏差来隐式促进公平估计。两种方法都基于优化框架。

Result: 方法在高概率性能边界下工作，揭示了准确性和公平性之间的条件权衡，表明无需牺牲准确性即可恢复公平图。在合成和真实数据集上的评估验证了有效性。

Conclusion: FairSpecTemp能够有效估计公平图，两种变体各有优势，为图公平性提供了谱域测量的新视角和实用解决方案。

Abstract: We estimate fair graphs from graph-stationary nodal observations such that
connections are not biased with respect to sensitive attributes. Edges in
real-world graphs often exhibit preferences for connecting certain pairs of
groups. Biased connections can not only exacerbate but even induce unfair
treatment for downstream graph-based tasks. We therefore consider group and
individual fairness for graphs corresponding to group- and node-level
definitions, respectively. To evaluate the fairness of a given graph, we
provide multiple bias metrics, including novel measurements in the spectral
domain. Furthermore, we propose Fair Spectral Templates (FairSpecTemp), an
optimization-based method with two variants for estimating fair graphs from
stationary graph signals, a general model for graph data subsuming many
existing ones. One variant of FairSpecTemp exploits commutativity properties of
graph stationarity while directly constraining bias, while the other implicitly
encourages fair estimates by restricting bias in the graph spectrum and is thus
more flexible. Our methods enjoy high probability performance bounds, yielding
a conditional tradeoff between fairness and accuracy. In particular, our
analysis reveals that accuracy need not be sacrificed to recover fair graphs.
We evaluate FairSpecTemp on synthetic and real-world data sets to illustrate
its effectiveness and highlight the advantages of both variants of
FairSpecTemp.

Motivation: 全数字孪生(DT)仿真计算成本高昂，需要开发能够直接建模感兴趣量(QoIs)动态特性的高效方法，避免完整的系统仿真。

Method: 使用基于记忆的流映射学习(FML)方法，利用全数字孪生生成的短轨迹数据构建数据驱动模型，整个过程为离线计算。

Result: 在二维不可压缩圆柱绕流CFD示例中，tDT能够准确预测长期流体动力，完全绕过完整的流场仿真。

Conclusion: FML-based tDT方法能够有效构建紧凑的动态系统，准确预测感兴趣量的长期动态，同时显著降低计算成本。

Abstract: We present a numerical framework for constructing a targeted digital twin
(tDT) that directly models the dynamics of quantities of interest (QoIs) in a
full digital twin (DT). The proposed approach employs memory-based flow map
learning (FML) to develop a data-driven model of the QoIs using short bursts of
trajectory data generated through repeated executions of the full DT. This
renders the construction of the FML-based tDT an entirely offline computational
process. During online simulation, the learned tDT can efficiently predict and
analyze the long-term dynamics of the QoIs without requiring simulations of the
full DT system, thereby achieving substantial computational savings. After
introducing the general numerical procedure, we demonstrate the construction
and predictive capability of the tDT in a computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
example: two-dimensional incompressible flow past a cylinder. The QoIs in this
problem are the hydrodynamic forces exerted on the cylinder. The resulting tDTs
are compact dynamical systems that evolve these forces without explicit
knowledge of the underlying flow field. Numerical results show that the tDTs
yield accurate long-term predictions of the forces while entirely bypassing
full flow simulations.

Conclusion: 毫米波Wi-Fi信号在人员识别方面具有显著优势，即使在低采样率下也能实现高精度识别。

Abstract: Person identification plays a vital role in enabling intelligent,
personalized, and secure human-computer interaction. Recent research has
demonstrated the feasibility of leveraging Wi-Fi signals for passive person
identification using a person's unique gait pattern. Although most existing
work focuses on sub-6 GHz frequencies, the emergence of mmWave offers new
opportunities through its finer spatial resolution, though its comparative
advantages for person identification remain unexplored. This work presents the
first comparative study between sub-6 GHz and mmWave Wi-Fi signals for person
identification with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Wi-Fi, using a novel
dataset of synchronized measurements from the two frequency bands in an indoor
environment. To ensure a fair comparison, we apply identical training pipelines
and model configurations across both frequency bands. Leveraging end-to-end
deep learning, we show that even at low sampling rates (10 Hz), mmWave Wi-Fi
signals can achieve high identification accuracy (91.2% on 20 individuals) when
combined with effective background subtraction.

Motivation: 作为理解dropout在大型神经网络中作用的第一步，研究其在两层神经网络大宽度渐近下的行为，以揭示dropout在不同学习率和dropout率组合下的本质机制。

Method: 采用大宽度渐近分析和平均场初始化尺度，研究梯度下降与dropout在两层神经网络中的行为，使用平均场粒子系统和随机过程的工具进行收敛性证明。

Conclusion: 研究结果为重新理论理解大规模神经网络中dropout的作用奠定了基础，揭示了dropout在不同参数区域的不同行为机制。

Abstract: Dropout is a standard training technique for neural networks that consists of
randomly deactivating units at each step of their gradient-based training. It
is known to improve performance in many settings, including in the large-scale
training of language or vision models. As a first step towards understanding
the role of dropout in large neural networks, we study the large-width
asymptotics of gradient descent with dropout on two-layer neural networks with
the mean-field initialization scale. We obtain a rich asymptotic phase diagram
that exhibits five distinct nondegenerate phases depending on the relative
magnitudes of the dropout rate, the learning rate, and the width. Notably, we
find that the well-studied "penalty" effect of dropout only persists in the
limit with impractically small learning rates of order $O(1/\text{width})$. For
larger learning rates, this effect disappears and in the limit, dropout is
equivalent to a "random geometry" technique, where the gradients are thinned
randomly after the forward and backward pass have been computed. In this
asymptotic regime, the limit is described by a mean-field jump process where
the neurons' update times follow independent Poisson or Bernoulli clocks
(depending on whether the learning rate vanishes or not). For some of the
phases, we obtain a description of the limit dynamics both in path-space and in
distribution-space. The convergence proofs involve a mix of tools from
mean-field particle systems and stochastic processes. Together, our results lay
the groundwork for a renewed theoretical understanding of dropout in
large-scale neural networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Learning to Defer (LtD)方法将人类和机器学习模型视为互斥的决策者，限制了专家贡献仅为预测。需要更灵活的人类-AI协作框架。

Method: 基于两阶段架构：标准ML模型和带有额外专家反馈的增强模型，采用形式化最优策略选择何时查询增强模型。提供顺序训练和联合训练两种实现方式。

Result: 在合成和真实专家数据上的实验表明，LtA为有效的人类-AI协作提供了更灵活和强大的基础。

Conclusion: LtA框架能够更好地处理何时以及如何整合专家输入，相比LtD方法提供了更有效的人类-AI协作解决方案。

Abstract: Developing decision-support systems that complement human performance in
classification tasks remains an open challenge. A popular approach, Learning to
Defer (LtD), allows a Machine Learning (ML) model to pass difficult cases to a
human expert. However, LtD treats humans and ML models as mutually exclusive
decision-makers, restricting the expert contribution to mere predictions. To
address this limitation, we propose Learning to Ask (LtA), a new framework that
handles both when and how to incorporate expert input in an ML model. LtA is
based on a two-part architecture: a standard ML model and an enriched model
trained with additional expert human feedback, with a formally optimal strategy
for selecting when to query the enriched model. We provide two practical
implementations of LtA: a sequential approach, which trains the models in
stages, and a joint approach, which optimises them simultaneously. For the
latter, we design surrogate losses with realisable-consistency guarantees. Our
experiments with synthetic and real expert data demonstrate that LtA provides a
more flexible and powerful foundation for effective human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: In this work, we present LOTUS (Learning to Learn with Optimal Transport for
Unsupervised Scenarios), a simple yet effective method to perform model
selection for multiple unsupervised machine learning(ML) tasks such as outlier

learning pipeline will perform well in a new dataset if it previously worked
well on datasets with a similar underlying data distribution. We use Optimal
Transport distances to find this similarity between unlabeled tabular datasets
and recommend machine learning pipelines with one unified single method on two
downstream unsupervised tasks: outlier detection and clustering. We present the
effectiveness of our approach with experiments against strong baselines and
show that LOTUS is a very promising first step toward model selection for
multiple unsupervised ML tasks.

Conclusion: 扩散生成方法为基于神经网络的符号回归开辟了新的研究机会，能够提供与自回归生成相当甚至更好的性能

Abstract: Symbolic regression refers to the task of finding a closed-form mathematical
expression to fit a set of data points. Genetic programming based techniques
are the most common algorithms used to tackle this problem, but recently,
neural-network based approaches have gained popularity. Most of the leading
neural-network based models used for symbolic regression utilize
transformer-based autoregressive models to generate an equation conditioned on
encoded input points. However, autoregressive generation is limited to
generating tokens left-to-right, and future generated tokens are conditioned
only on previously generated tokens. Motivated by the desire to generate all
tokens simultaneously to produce improved closed-form equations, we propose
Symbolic Diffusion, a D3PM based discrete state-space diffusion model which
simultaneously generates all tokens of the equation at once using discrete
token diffusion. Using the bivariate dataset developed for SymbolicGPT, we
compared our diffusion-based generation approach to an autoregressive model
based on SymbolicGPT, using equivalent encoder and transformer architectures.
We demonstrate that our novel approach of using diffusion-based generation for
symbolic regression can offer comparable and, by some metrics, improved
performance over autoregressive generation in models using similar underlying
architectures, opening new research opportunities in neural-network based
symbolic regression.

TL;DR: 该论文提出ExpA方法，将环境交互从语言中解耦，通过扩展动作空间让LLM能够直接与环境交互，无需通过文本解析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM与环境交互时必须通过文本格式进行解析和路由的问题，减轻模型语言负担，避免需要手工解析器。

Method: 使用扩展动作空间(ExpA)内部化环境交互，引入ExpA强化学习(EARL)和反事实策略优化来促进新环境的有效探索。

Result: 在多轮交互和条件规划任务中，EARL优于词汇受限动作的基线方法，在计算器多任务学习和部分观察排序问题上表现优异。

Conclusion: ExpA方法能够有效解耦语言推理和环境控制，让LLM自主发现高效算法，在复杂交互任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful reasoners in natural language, but
their actions are typically confined to outputting vocabulary tokens. As a
result, interactions with external environments -- such as symbolic operators
or simulators -- must be expressed through text in predefined formats, parsed,
and routed to external interfaces. This overloads the model's language with
both reasoning and control duties, and requires a hand-crafted parser, external
to the LLM. To address this, we decouple environment interactions from language
by internalizing them in an Expanded Action space (ExpA), beyond the
vocabulary. The model starts reasoning in the default language environment, but
may trigger routing actions and switch to an external environment at any time.
From there, the model can only invoke environment-specific actions, receive
feedback from the environment, and potentially route back to language as a
result. To promote effective exploration of the expanded action space and new
environments, we introduce ExpA Reinforcement Learning (EARL) with
counterfactual policy optimization. On tasks requiring multi-turn interactions
and contingent planning, EARL outperforms strong baselines with
vocabulary-constrained actions. It performs robustly across calculator-based
multi-task learning and, in the partially observed sorting problem, achieves
perfect Sort-4 accuracy while self-discovering an efficient algorithm
competitive with classical designs.

Motivation: 现有时序图机器学习库往往针对特定架构设计，缺乏统一框架，且连续时间和离散时间方法之间存在隔阂，阻碍了直接比较和思想交流。

Method: 开发了TGM库，统一支持连续时间和离散时间动态图方法，提供动态节点特征、时间粒度转换、链接/节点/图级别任务的原生支持。

Result: 相比广泛使用的DyGLib，TGM在多个模型、数据集和任务上平均获得7.8倍加速；在图离散化方面相比现有实现平均获得175倍加速。

Conclusion: TGM不仅提升了效率，还通过支持动态图属性预测和时间驱动训练范式，开启了全新的研究方向，解决了之前难以研究的问题。

Abstract: Well-designed open-source software drives progress in Machine Learning (ML)
research. While static graph ML enjoys mature frameworks like PyTorch Geometric
and DGL, ML for temporal graphs (TG), networks that evolve over time, lacks
comparable infrastructure. Existing TG libraries are often tailored to specific
architectures, hindering support for diverse models in this rapidly evolving
field. Additionally, the divide between continuous- and discrete-time dynamic
graph methods (CTDG and DTDG) limits direct comparisons and idea transfer. To
address these gaps, we introduce Temporal Graph Modelling (TGM), a
research-oriented library for ML on temporal graphs, the first to unify CTDG
and DTDG approaches. TGM offers first-class support for dynamic node features,
time-granularity conversions, and native handling of link-, node-, and
graph-level tasks. Empirically, TGM achieves an average 7.8x speedup across
multiple models, datasets, and tasks compared to the widely used DyGLib, and an
average 175x speedup on graph discretization relative to available
implementations. Beyond efficiency, we show in our experiments how TGM unlocks
entirely new research possibilities by enabling dynamic graph property
prediction and time-driven training paradigms, opening the door to questions
previously impractical to study. TGM is available at

*Sizhe Ma,Katherine A. Flanigan,Mario Bergés,James D. Brooks*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于注意力机制的Transformer模型，用于铁路间接结构健康监测中的断轨检测，通过无监督学习方法解决小尺寸瞬态异常检测的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于车载传感器的间接结构健康监测(iSHM)为铁路轨道评估提供了经济有效的方案，但可靠检测2-10厘米的小尺寸瞬态异常面临重大挑战，主要由于复杂的车辆动力学、信号噪声以及标记数据稀缺限制了监督学习方法的应用。

Method: 采用无监督深度学习方法，提出了注意力聚焦Transformer模型。该模型使用自注意力机制，通过重构训练，但创新性地主要从学习到的注意力权重偏差中推导异常分数，旨在实现有效性和计算效率。

Result: 基准测试结果表明，基于Transformer的模型通常优于其他模型，但所有测试模型都对高频局部噪声表现出显著脆弱性，这被确定为实际部署的关键瓶颈。所提出的模型在达到与最先进解决方案相当的准确性的同时，展现出更好的推理速度。

Conclusion: 研究强调了未来iSHM模型需要增强噪声鲁棒性的关键需求，并将我们更高效的基于注意力的方法定位为开发实用车载异常检测系统的有前景基础。

Abstract: Indirect structural health monitoring (iSHM) for broken rail detection using
onboard sensors presents a cost-effective paradigm for railway track
assessment, yet reliably detecting small, transient anomalies (2-10 cm) remains
a significant challenge due to complex vehicle dynamics, signal noise, and the
scarcity of labeled data limiting supervised approaches. This study addresses
these issues through unsupervised deep learning. We introduce an incremental
synthetic data benchmark designed to systematically evaluate model robustness
against progressively complex challenges like speed variations, multi-channel
inputs, and realistic noise patterns encountered in iSHM. Using this benchmark,
we evaluate several established unsupervised models alongside our proposed
Attention-Focused Transformer. Our model employs a self-attention mechanism,
trained via reconstruction but innovatively deriving anomaly scores primarily
from deviations in learned attention weights, aiming for both effectiveness and
computational efficiency. Benchmarking results reveal that while
transformer-based models generally outperform others, all tested models exhibit
significant vulnerability to high-frequency localized noise, identifying this
as a critical bottleneck for practical deployment. Notably, our proposed model
achieves accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art solution while
demonstrating better inference speed. This highlights the crucial need for
enhanced noise robustness in future iSHM models and positions our more
efficient attention-based approach as a promising foundation for developing
practical onboard anomaly detection systems.

TL;DR: DGTEN是一个用于动态信任评估的图神经网络框架，通过高斯分布表示节点和边的不确定性，结合时间建模和防御机制，在比特币信任网络中显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型快速演化的图需要能够捕捉变化关系、表达校准置信度并抵抗对抗性操纵的信任评估模型。

Method: 使用高斯分布表示节点和边，结合不确定性感知的消息传递、混合绝对-高斯-沙漏位置编码、Kolmogorov-Arnold网络注意力机制、ODE残差学习模块，以及基于余弦和Jaccard相似度的鲁棒自适应集成系数分析。

Result: 在比特币信任网络中，单时间槽预测MCC提升10.77%，冷启动场景MCC提升16.41%，在对抗性攻击下MCC提升达11.63%。

Conclusion: DGTEN统一框架在动态信任评估中表现出有效性，能够进行风险感知决策并抵抗多种攻击。

Abstract: Dynamic trust evaluation in large, rapidly evolving graphs requires models
that can capture changing relationships, express calibrated confidence, and
resist adversarial manipulation. DGTEN (Deep Gaussian-based Trust Evaluation
Network) introduces a unified graph framework that achieves all three by
combining uncertainty-aware message passing, expressive temporal modeling, and
built-in defenses against trust-targeted attacks. It represents nodes and edges
as Gaussian distributions so that both semantic signals and epistemic
uncertainty propagate through the graph neural network, enabling risk-aware
trust decisions rather than overconfident guesses. To model how trust evolves,
it employs hybrid Absolute-Gaussian-Hourglass (HAGH) positional encoding with
Kolmogorov-Arnold network-based unbiased multi-head attention, followed by an
ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based residual learning module to jointly
capture abrupt shifts and smooth trends. Robust adaptive ensemble coefficient
analysis prunes or down-weights suspicious interactions using complementary
cosine and Jaccard similarity measures, mitigating reputation laundering,
sabotage, and on/off attacks. On two signed Bitcoin trust networks, DGTEN
delivers significant improvements: in single-timeslot prediction on
Bitcoin-Alpha, it improves MCC by 10.77% over the best dynamic baseline; in the
cold-start scenario, it achieves a 16.41% MCC gain - the largest across all
tasks and datasets. Under adversarial on/off attacks, it surpasses the baseline
by up to 11.63% MCC. These results validate the effectiveness of the unified
DGTEN framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型遗忘研究目前缺乏统一标准，现有评估方法过于依赖选择题准确率，无法全面反映模型的实际生成行为，需要更严谨的评估框架。

Conclusion: 为LLM遗忘研究提供了全面的重新审视和可操作的指导，强调需要更精细的评估方法来指导未来方法的设计和评估。

Abstract: Machine unlearning for large language models (LLMs) aims to remove undesired
data, knowledge, and behaviors (e.g., for safety, privacy, or copyright) while
preserving useful model capabilities. Despite rapid progress over the past two
years, research in LLM unlearning remains fragmented, with limited clarity on
what constitutes effective unlearning and how it should be rigorously
evaluated. In this work, we present a principled taxonomy of twelve recent
stateful unlearning methods, grouped into three methodological families:
divergence-driven optimization, representation misalignment, and
rejection-based targeted unlearning. Building on this taxonomy, we revisit the
evaluation of unlearning effectiveness (UE), utility retention (UT), and
robustness (Rob), focusing on the WMDP benchmark. Our analysis shows that
current evaluations, dominated by multiple-choice question (MCQ) accuracy,
offer only a narrow perspective, often overstating success while overlooking
the model's actual generation behavior. To address this gap, we introduce open
question-answering (Open-QA) metrics that better capture generative performance
and reveal the inherent UE-UT tradeoff across method families. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that robustness requires finer-grained analysis: for example,
vulnerabilities differ substantially between in-domain relearning and
out-of-domain fine-tuning, even though both fall under model-level attacks.
Through this study, we hope to deliver a full-stack revisit of LLM unlearning
and actionable guidance for designing and evaluating future methods.

Abstract: In multi-armed bandits with network interference (MABNI), the action taken by
one node can influence the rewards of others, creating complex interdependence.
While existing research on MABNI largely concentrates on minimizing regret, it
often overlooks the crucial concern that an excessive emphasis on the optimal
arm can undermine the inference accuracy for sub-optimal arms. Although initial
efforts have been made to address this trade-off in single-unit scenarios,
these challenges have become more pronounced in the context of MABNI. In this
paper, we establish, for the first time, a theoretical Pareto frontier
characterizing the trade-off between regret minimization and inference accuracy
in adversarial (design-based) MABNI. We further introduce an anytime-valid
asymptotic confidence sequence along with a corresponding algorithm,
$\texttt{EXP3-N-CS}$, specifically designed to balance the trade-off between
regret minimization and inference accuracy in this setting.

Conclusion: ICS方法在缓解灾难性遗忘方面有效，但揭示了持续学习中的复杂性和权衡，特别是在任务数量增加时，需要进一步研究。

Abstract: Continual learning the ability of a neural network to learn multiple
sequential tasks without losing previously acquired knowledge remains a
significant obstacle to developing truly adaptive artificial intelligence. Deep
learning models have achieved remarkable results in various applications, but
overfitting remains a common issue. Regularization techniques can help prevent
overfitting by adding constraints to the model's parameters. To prevent
catastrophic forgetting, in this paper we introduce a novel regularization
technique based on inter-cluster separation (ICS) in the loss function, which
penalizes the model for producing outputs that are far away from the centroids
of the clusters formed by the data from previous tasks. We also performed
hyperparameter tuning to find the optimal weighting of the proposed
regularization term. This ensures clearer separation between tasks in the
neural network's internal representation, reducing overlap and mitigating
forgetting. Using the standard 5-task Split CIFAR-10 benchmark and a ResNet-18
architecture, we demonstrate ICS's effectiveness in maintaining strong
performance on initial tasks. However, our results also highlight limitations
in long-term knowledge retention, particularly when the number of tasks
increases. This underscores the complexity and trade-offs inherent in continual
learning and points toward avenues for further research.

Method: 使用灵活的流模型估计完整回报分布，提出新的流匹配目标生成满足分布贝尔曼方程的概率密度路径，基于学习到的流模型通过流导数ODE估计状态回报不确定性。

Conclusion: 流模型能够有效估计完整回报分布，提供更强的学习信号，在探索和安全强化学习中具有应用价值。

Abstract: While most reinforcement learning methods today flatten the distribution of
future returns to a single scalar value, distributional RL methods exploit the
return distribution to provide stronger learning signals and to enable
applications in exploration and safe RL. While the predominant method for
estimating the return distribution is by modeling it as a categorical
distribution over discrete bins or estimating a finite number of quantiles,
such approaches leave unanswered questions about the fine-grained structure of
the return distribution and about how to distinguish states with high return
uncertainty for decision-making. The key idea in this paper is to use modern,
flexible flow-based models to estimate the full future return distributions and
identify those states with high return variance. We do so by formulating a new
flow-matching objective that generates probability density paths satisfying the
distributional Bellman equation. Building upon the learned flow models, we
estimate the return uncertainty of distinct states using a new flow derivative
ODE. We additionally use this uncertainty information to prioritize learning a
more accurate return estimation on certain transitions. We compare our method
(Value Flows) with prior methods in the offline and online-to-online settings.
Experiments on $37$ state-based and $25$ image-based benchmark tasks
demonstrate that Value Flows achieves a $1.3\times$ improvement on average in
success rates. Website: https://pd-perry.github.io/value-flows Code:

Conclusion: DEAS是一个简单有效的离线RL框架，通过动作序列和分离价值学习解决了复杂长视野任务中的挑战。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) presents an attractive paradigm for
training intelligent agents without expensive online interactions. However,
current approaches still struggle with complex, long-horizon sequential
decision making. In this work, we introduce DEtached value learning with Action
Sequence (DEAS), a simple yet effective offline RL framework that leverages
action sequences for value learning. These temporally extended actions provide
richer information than single-step actions and can be interpreted through the
options framework via semi-Markov decision process Q-learning, enabling
reduction of the effective planning horizon by considering longer sequences at
once. However, directly adopting such sequences in actor-critic algorithms
introduces excessive value overestimation, which we address through detached
value learning that steers value estimates toward in-distribution actions that
achieve high return in the offline dataset. We demonstrate that DEAS
consistently outperforms baselines on complex, long-horizon tasks from OGBench
and can be applied to enhance the performance of large-scale
Vision-Language-Action models that predict action sequences, significantly
boosting performance in both RoboCasa Kitchen simulation tasks and real-world
manipulation tasks.

Motivation: 半异步联邦学习(SAFL)在梯度聚合和模型聚合策略之间存在权衡：梯度聚合收敛快但波动大，模型聚合稳定但收敛慢且精度低。需要统一解决方案来平衡这些差异。

Method: FedQS采用分治策略，根据数据分布特征和计算资源将客户端分为四种类型，并自适应优化它们的本地训练过程。

Conclusion: FedQS弥合了SAFL中聚合策略之间的差距，为稳定、准确和高效的联邦学习提供了统一解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple
parties without sharing raw data, with semi-asynchronous FL (SAFL) emerging as
a balanced approach between synchronous and asynchronous FL. However, SAFL
faces significant challenges in optimizing both gradient-based (e.g., FedSGD)
and model-based (e.g., FedAvg) aggregation strategies, which exhibit distinct
trade-offs in accuracy, convergence speed, and stability. While gradient
aggregation achieves faster convergence and higher accuracy, it suffers from
pronounced fluctuations, whereas model aggregation offers greater stability but
slower convergence and suboptimal accuracy. This paper presents FedQS, the
first framework to theoretically analyze and address these disparities in SAFL.
FedQS introduces a divide-and-conquer strategy to handle client heterogeneity
by classifying clients into four distinct types and adaptively optimizing their
local training based on data distribution characteristics and available
computational resources. Extensive experiments on computer vision, natural
language processing, and real-world tasks demonstrate that FedQS achieves the
highest accuracy, attains the lowest loss, and ranks among the fastest in
convergence speed, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Our work bridges
the gap between aggregation strategies in SAFL, offering a unified solution for
stable, accurate, and efficient federated learning. The code and datasets are

Abstract: In AI-powered e-commerce livestreaming, digital avatars require real-time
responses to drive engagement, a task for which high-latency Large Reasoning
Models (LRMs) are ill-suited. We introduce LiveThinking, a practical two-stage
optimization framework to bridge this gap. First, we address computational cost
by distilling a 670B teacher LRM into a lightweight 30B Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) model (3B active) using Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT). This
reduces deployment overhead but preserves the teacher's verbose reasoning,
causing latency. To solve this, our second stage employs reinforcement learning
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to compress the model's
reasoning path, guided by a multi-objective reward function balancing
correctness, helpfulness, and brevity. LiveThinking achieves a 30-fold
reduction in computational cost, enabling sub-second latency. In real-world
application on Taobao Live, it improved response correctness by 3.3% and
helpfulness by 21.8%. Tested by hundreds of thousands of viewers, our system
led to a statistically significant increase in Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV),
demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing user experience and commercial
performance in live, interactive settings.

Motivation: 传统图随机特征(GRFs)存在难以建模远距离节点关系、依赖采样长随机游走效率低、游走终止机制过于简单等问题，需要改进以提升图核计算的效率和精度。

Method: 提出游走拼接技术，将多个短游走拼接而不破坏无偏性；扩展游走终止机制，采用更一般的游走长度分布策略；用并行计算短游走和矩阵乘法替代顺序采样长游走。

Result: GRFs++继承了长游走的近似质量但计算效率更高，提升了图核的近似精度且不增加额外计算成本，理论和实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: GRFs++通过创新的游走拼接和灵活的终止策略，成功解决了传统GRFs的关键限制，为图核计算提供了更高效准确的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose refined GRFs (GRFs++), a new class of Graph Random Features (GRFs)
for efficient and accurate computations involving kernels defined on the nodes
of a graph. GRFs++ resolve some of the long-standing limitations of regular
GRFs, including difficulty modeling relationships between more distant nodes.
They reduce dependence on sampling long graph random walks via a novel
walk-stitching technique, concatenating several shorter walks without breaking
unbiasedness. By applying these techniques, GRFs++ inherit the approximation
quality provided by longer walks but with greater efficiency, trading
sequential, inefficient sampling of a long walk for parallel computation of
short walks and matrix-matrix multiplication. Furthermore, GRFs++ extend the
simplistic GRFs walk termination mechanism (Bernoulli schemes with fixed
halting probabilities) to a broader class of strategies, applying general
distributions on the walks' lengths. This improves the approximation accuracy
of graph kernels, without incurring extra computational cost. We provide
empirical evaluations to showcase all our claims and complement our results
with theoretical analysis.

Motivation: 由于LBSN签到轨迹数据收集成本高且存在隐私问题，需要生成既能保护隐私又能保留真实数据特征的合成数据，但现有方法难以处理轨迹数据的空间离散、时间不规则特性。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：第一阶段使用稀疏感知空间-时间扩散模型从原始轨迹重建连续规则的运动序列；第二阶段使用Transformer Seq2Seq架构，通过动态上下文融合和多任务混合头解码器生成细粒度轨迹。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的实验表明，GeoGen在保真度和实用性评估上均优于现有最优模型，在FS-TKY数据集上距离和半径指标分别提升超过69%和55%。

Conclusion: GeoGen框架有效解决了LBSN轨迹生成的挑战，生成的合成数据既保护隐私又具有高质量，为POI推荐、广告投放等应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Location-Based Social Network (LBSN) check-in trajectory data are important
for many practical applications, like POI recommendation, advertising, and
pandemic intervention. However, the high collection costs and ever-increasing
privacy concerns prevent us from accessing large-scale LBSN trajectory data.
The recent advances in synthetic data generation provide us with a new
opportunity to achieve this, which utilizes generative AI to generate synthetic
data that preserves the characteristics of real data while ensuring privacy
protection. However, generating synthetic LBSN check-in trajectories remains
challenging due to their spatially discrete, temporally irregular nature and
the complex spatio-temporal patterns caused by sparse activities and uncertain
human mobility. To address this challenge, we propose GeoGen, a two-stage
coarse-to-fine framework for large-scale LBSN check-in trajectory generation.
In the first stage, we reconstruct spatially continuous, temporally regular
latent movement sequences from the original LBSN check-in trajectories and then
design a Sparsity-aware Spatio-temporal Diffusion model (S$^2$TDiff) with an
efficient denosing network to learn their underlying behavioral patterns. In
the second stage, we design Coarse2FineNet, a Transformer-based Seq2Seq
architecture equipped with a dynamic context fusion mechanism in the encoder
and a multi-task hybrid-head decoder, which generates fine-grained LBSN
trajectories based on coarse-grained latent movement sequences by modeling
semantic relevance and behavioral uncertainty. Extensive experiments on four
real-world datasets show that GeoGen excels state-of-the-art models for both
fidelity and utility evaluation, e.g., it increases over 69% and 55% in

*Chengting Yu,Xiaobo Shu,Yadao Wang,Yizhen Zhang,Haoyi Wu,Jiaang Li,Rujiao Long,Ziheng Chen,Yuchi Xu,Wenbo Su,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了MeSH方案，通过外部化状态管理到显式内存缓冲区和使用轻量级路由器动态多样化迭代计算，解决了递归变换器中的计算未分化和信息过载问题，在Pythia套件上显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 递归变换器虽然通过参数重用和多次迭代隐藏状态来解耦计算深度和参数深度，但在相同计算量下，参数较少的递归模型往往落后于非递归模型。研究发现这主要源于两个瓶颈：计算未分化和信息过载。

Method: 引入Memory-as-State-Highways (MeSH)方案，将状态管理外部化到显式内存缓冲区，并使用轻量级路由器动态多样化各迭代的计算模式。

Result: 在Pythia套件（160M-1.4B）上，MeSH增强的递归变换器持续优于递归基线，在1.4B规模上超越了更大的非递归对应模型，平均下游准确率提升+1.06%，非嵌入参数减少33%。

Conclusion: MeSH被确立为构建更强递归模型的可扩展且原则性的架构，通过诱导迭代间的功能专门化成功解决了递归变换器的病理问题。

Abstract: Recursive transformers reuse parameters and iterate over hidden states
multiple times, decoupling compute depth from parameter depth. However, under
matched compute, recursive models with fewer parameters often lag behind
non-recursive counterparts. By probing hidden states, we trace this performance
gap to two primary bottlenecks: undifferentiated computation, where the core is
forced to adopt a similar computational pattern at every iteration, and
information overload, where long-lived and transient information must coexist
in a single hidden state. To address the issues, we introduce a
Memory-as-State-Highways (MeSH) scheme, which externalizes state management
into an explicit memory buffer and employs lightweight routers to dynamically
diversify computation across iterations. Probing visualizations confirm that
MeSH successfully resolves the pathologies by inducing functional
specialization across iterations. On the Pythia suite (160M-1.4B),
MeSH-enhanced recursive transformers consistently improve over recursive
baselines and outperforms its larger non-recursive counterpart at the 1.4B
scale, improving average downstream accuracy by +1.06% with 33% fewer
non-embedding parameters. Our analysis establishes MeSH as a scalable and
principled architecture for building stronger recursive models.

TL;DR: t-SNE可视化结果不能可靠反映输入数据的聚类强度和离群点极端程度，存在系统性的误导性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示t-SNE可视化结果与输入数据结构之间的系统性不匹配问题，挑战人们普遍认为t-SNE能准确反映数据结构的信念

Method: 通过理论证明和实际案例演示，分析t-SNE在聚类强度和离群点识别方面的局限性

Result: 证明t-SNE输出无法可靠推断输入数据的聚类强度和离群点极端程度，这些失败模式在实践中普遍存在

Conclusion: t-SNE可视化结果具有误导性，不能作为判断数据聚类强度和离群点特征的可靠依据

Abstract: Central to the widespread use of t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding
(t-SNE) is the conviction that it produces visualizations whose structure
roughly matches that of the input. To the contrary, we prove that (1) the
strength of the input clustering, and (2) the extremity of outlier points,
cannot be reliably inferred from the t-SNE output. We demonstrate the
prevalence of these failure modes in practice as well.

TL;DR: FedBook是一个联邦图基础模型代码本，通过两阶段聚合客户端本地代码本：域内协作增强语义一致性，域间整合保留跨域多样性，在多个基准测试中优于21个基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图基础模型需要集中访问多域图数据，但隐私和机构限制使这不可行。联邦图基础模型解决了这个问题，但其有效性依赖于构建既保持域内语义一致性又保留域间多样性的全局代码本。

Method: 提出FedBook，在服务器端联邦预训练期间系统聚合客户端本地代码本。包含两个阶段：(1) 域内协作：通过参考语义更可靠的高频token来优化低频token；(2) 域间整合：根据客户端代码本的语义独特性加权聚合，保留跨域多样性。

Result: 在8个基准测试上进行的广泛实验表明，FedBook在多个领域和任务中一致优于21个基线方法，包括孤立监督学习、FL/FGL、集中式GFM的联邦适应和FedGFM技术。

Conclusion: FedBook通过有效的域内协作和域间整合机制，成功构建了鲁棒的联邦图基础模型代码本，在保护隐私的同时实现了跨域泛化能力。

Abstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable cross-domain generalization in
language and vision, inspiring the development of graph foundation models
(GFMs). However, existing GFMs typically assume centralized access to
multi-domain graphs, which is often infeasible due to privacy and institutional
constraints. Federated Graph Foundation Models (FedGFMs) address this
limitation, but their effectiveness fundamentally hinges on constructing a
robust global codebook that achieves intra-domain coherence by consolidating
mutually reinforcing semantics within each domain, while also maintaining
inter-domain diversity by retaining heterogeneous knowledge across domains. To
this end, we propose FedBook, a unified federated graph foundation codebook
that systematically aggregates clients' local codebooks during server-side
federated pre-training. FedBook follows a two-phase process: (1) Intra-domain
Collaboration, where low-frequency tokens are refined by referencing more
semantically reliable high-frequency tokens across clients to enhance
domain-specific coherence; and (2) Inter-domain Integration, where client
contributions are weighted by the semantic distinctiveness of their codebooks
during the aggregation of the global GFM, thereby preserving cross-domain
diversity. Extensive experiments on 8 benchmarks across multiple domains and
tasks demonstrate that FedBook consistently outperforms 21 baselines, including
isolated supervised learning, FL/FGL, federated adaptations of centralized
GFMs, and FedGFM techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有锐度度量与泛化能力的相关性通常不强，有时甚至很弱。为了弥补直觉与现实之间的差距，需要一种更好的锐度度量方法。

Method: 1) 定义Rényi锐度为损失Hessian矩阵的负Rényi熵；2) 利用Rényi熵简洁地表征Hessian特征值的分布程度；3) 提出Rényi锐度感知最小化(RSAM)作为正则化方法。

Result: 实验验证了Rényi锐度与泛化能力之间存在强相关性（特别是Kendall秩相关）。RSAM方法在所有现有的锐度感知最小化方法中表现最佳，相比经典SAM方法测试准确率提升近2.5%。

Conclusion: Rényi锐度是一种有效的泛化能力度量指标，基于此提出的RSAM训练方法能显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Sharpness (of the loss minima) is a common measure to investigate the
generalization of neural networks. Intuitively speaking, the flatter the
landscape near the minima is, the better generalization might be.
Unfortunately, the correlation between many existing sharpness measures and the
generalization is usually not strong, sometimes even weak. To close the gap
between the intuition and the reality, we propose a novel sharpness measure,
i.e., \textit{R\'enyi sharpness}, which is defined as the negative R\'enyi
entropy (a generalization of the classical Shannon entropy) of the loss
Hessian. The main ideas are as follows: 1) we realize that \textit{uniform}
(identical) eigenvalues of the loss Hessian is most desirable (while keeping
the sum constant) to achieve good generalization; 2) we employ the
\textit{R\'enyi entropy} to concisely characterize the extent of the spread of
the eigenvalues of loss Hessian. Normally, the larger the spread, the smaller
the (R\'enyi) entropy. To rigorously establish the relationship between
generalization and (R\'enyi) sharpness, we provide several generalization
bounds in terms of R\'enyi sharpness, by taking advantage of the
reparametrization invariance property of R\'enyi sharpness, as well as the
trick of translating the data discrepancy to the weight perturbation.
Furthermore, extensive experiments are conducted to verify the strong
correlation (in specific, Kendall rank correlation) between the R\'enyi
sharpness and generalization. Moreover, we propose to use a variant of R\'enyi
Sharpness as regularizer during training, i.e., R\'enyi Sharpness Aware
Minimization (RSAM), which turns out to outperform all existing sharpness-aware
minimization methods. It is worthy noting that the test accuracy gain of our
proposed RSAM method could be as high as nearly 2.5\%, compared against the
classical SAM method.

Result: 在模拟和真实大规模广告系统上的实验表明，相比典型基线方法有显著改进。

Conclusion: VAMO方法通过验证对齐的多任务优化，有效提升了广告竞价系统的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: In online advertising, heterogeneous advertiser requirements give rise to
numerous customized bidding tasks that are typically optimized independently,
resulting in extensive computation and limited data efficiency. Multi-task
learning offers a principled framework to train these tasks jointly through
shared representations. However, existing multi-task optimization strategies
are primarily guided by training dynamics and often generalize poorly in
volatile bidding environments. To this end, we present Validation-Aligned
Multi-task Optimization (VAMO), which adaptively assigns task weights based on
the alignment between per-task training gradients and a held-out validation
gradient, thereby steering updates toward validation improvement and better
matching deployment objectives. We further equip the framework with a
periodicity-aware temporal module and couple it with an advanced generative
auto-bidding backbone to enhance cross-task transfer of seasonal structure and
strengthen bidding performance. Meanwhile, we provide theoretical insights into
the proposed method, e.g., convergence guarantee and alignment analysis.
Extensive experiments on both simulated and large-scale real-world advertising
systems consistently demonstrate significant improvements over typical
baselines, illuminating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Method: 提出分层自适应调制方案，根据DNN层的重要性自动决定不同层的最优调制级别，而不是为所有层使用相同的调制级别。

Conclusion: 分层自适应调制方案通过考虑DNN层的重要性差异，能够有效减少无线联邦学习的通信延迟，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: In wireless federated learning (FL), the clients need to transmit the
high-dimensional deep neural network (DNN) parameters through bandwidth-limited
channels, which causes the communication latency issue. In this paper, we
propose a layer-wise adaptive modulation scheme to save the communication
latency. Unlike existing works which assign the same modulation level for all
DNN layers, we consider the layers' importance which provides more freedom to
save the latency. The proposed scheme can automatically decide the optimal
modulation levels for different DNN layers. Experimental results show that the
proposed scheme can save up to 73.9% of communication latency compared with the
existing schemes.

Abstract: Insect species subject to infection, predation, and anisotropic environmental
conditions may exhibit preferential movement patterns. Given the innate
stochasticity of exogenous factors driving these patterns over short
timescales, individual insect trajectories typically obey overdamped stochastic
dynamics. In practice, data-driven modeling approaches designed to learn the
underlying Fokker-Planck equations from observed insect distributions serve as
ideal tools for understanding and predicting such behavior. Understanding
dispersal dynamics of crop and silvicultural pests can lead to a better
forecasting of outbreak intensity and location, which can result in better pest
management. In this work, we extend weak-form equation learning techniques,
coupled with kernel density estimation, to learn effective models for
lepidopteran larval population movement from highly sparse experimental data.
Galerkin methods such as the Weak form Sparse Identification of Nonlinear
Dynamics (WSINDy) algorithm have recently proven useful for learning governing
equations in several scientific contexts. We demonstrate the utility of the
method on a sparse dataset of position measurements of fall armyworms
(Spodoptera frugiperda) obtained in simulated agricultural conditions with
varied plant resources and infection status.

Conclusion: 该框架为生物医学和数据密集型科学领域提供了可靠且可解释的LLM适应的数学基础路径

Abstract: The extraction and standardization of pharmacokinetic (PK) information from
scientific literature remain significant challenges in computational
pharmacology, which limits the reliability of data-driven models in drug
development. Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
text understanding and reasoning, yet their adaptation to structured biomedical
data, such as PK tables, remains constrained by heterogeneity, noise, and
domain shift. To address these limitations, we propose HySim-LLM, a unified
mathematical and computational framework that integrates embedding-weighted
fine-tuning and manifold-aware denoising to enhance the robustness and
interpretability of LLMs. We establish two theoretical results: (1) a
similarity-weighted generalization bound that quantifies adaptation performance
under embedding divergence, and (2) a manifold-based denoising guarantee that
bounds loss contributions from noisy or off-manifold samples. These theorems
provide a principled foundation for fine-tuning LLMs in structured biomedical
settings. The framework offers a mathematically grounded pathway toward
reliable and interpretable LLM adaptation for biomedical and data-intensive
scientific domains.

Result: 实现可比的遗忘效果，同时在保留模型原有知识方面显著优于现有方法

Conclusion: SIMU框架通过选择性神经元更新，有效解决了机器遗忘中遗忘效果与模型效用保持之间的权衡问题

Abstract: The undesired memorization of sensitive information by Large Language Models
(LLMs) has emphasized the need for safety mechanisms that can regulate model
behavior. This has led to the development of machine unlearning techniques that
enable models to precisely forget sensitive and unwanted information. For
machine unlearning, first-order and second-order optimizer-based methods have
shown significant progress in enabling LLMs to forget targeted information.
However, in doing so, these approaches often compromise the model's original
capabilities, resulting in unlearned models that struggle to retain their prior
knowledge and overall utility. To address this, we propose Selective Influence
Machine Unlearning (SIMU), a two-step framework that enhances second-order
optimizer-based unlearning by selectively updating only the critical neurons
responsible for encoding the forget-set. By constraining updates to these
targeted neurons, SIMU achieves comparable unlearning efficacy while
substantially outperforming current methods in retaining the model's original
knowledge.

Conclusion: MetaDefense框架通过两阶段防御策略有效防御基于微调的越狱攻击，在保持良性任务性能的同时提供强大的安全保护。

Abstract: This paper introduces MetaDefense, a novel framework for defending against
finetuning-based jailbreak attacks in large language models (LLMs). We observe
that existing defense mechanisms fail to generalize to harmful queries
disguised by unseen attack templates, despite LLMs being capable of
distinguishing disguised harmful queries in the embedding space. Based on these
insights, we propose a two-stage defense approach: (i) pre-generation defense
that detects harmful queries before response generation begins, and (ii)
mid-generation defense that monitors partial responses during generation to
prevent outputting more harmful content. Our MetaDefense trains the LLM to
predict the harmfulness of both queries and partial responses using specialized
prompts, enabling early termination of potentially harmful interactions.
Extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures (LLaMA-2-7B,
Qwen-2.5-3B-Instruct, and LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct) demonstrate that MetaDefense
significantly outperforms existing defense mechanisms, achieving robust defense
against harmful queries with seen and unseen attack templates while maintaining
competitive performance on benign tasks. Code is available at

Motivation: 传统语言模型微调需要大量训练数据，效率低下且成本高昂，且无法保证模型能处理复杂场景或更好泛化。现有技术很少评估训练样本是否提供新信息，导致不必要的成本。

Method: 三步骤算法：1) 识别模型难以处理的样本（自我意识）；2) 从检测到的不确定样本生成类似示例（自数据增强）；3) 在测试时使用新生成样本进行微调（自改进）。研究TT-SI（同一模型生成训练示例）和TT-D（更强模型生成示例）两种变体。

Result: TT-SI在所有基准测试中平均绝对准确率提升+5.48%，超越其他标准学习方法，同时使用样本量减少68倍。

Conclusion: 测试时自改进算法展示了构建更强大智能体实现自我进化的新范式潜力。

Abstract: One paradigm of language model (LM) fine-tuning relies on creating large
training datasets, under the assumption that high quantity and diversity will
enable models to generalize to novel tasks after post-training. In practice,
gathering large sets of data is inefficient, and training on them is
prohibitively expensive; worse, there is no guarantee that the resulting model
will handle complex scenarios or generalize better. Moreover, existing
techniques rarely assess whether a training sample provides novel information
or is redundant with the knowledge already acquired by the model, resulting in
unnecessary costs. In this work, we explore a new test-time self-improvement
method to create more effective and generalizable agentic LMs on-the-fly. The
proposed algorithm can be summarized in three steps: (i) first it identifies
the samples that model struggles with (self-awareness), (ii) then generates
similar examples from detected uncertain samples (self-data augmentation), and
(iii) uses these newly generated samples at test-time fine-tuning
(self-improvement). We study two variants of this approach: Test-Time
Self-Improvement (TT-SI), where the same model generates additional training
examples from its own uncertain cases and then learns from them, and contrast
this approach with Test-Time Distillation (TT-D), where a stronger model
generates similar examples for uncertain cases, enabling student to adapt using
distilled supervision. Empirical evaluations across different agent benchmarks
demonstrate that TT-SI improves the performance with +5.48% absolute accuracy
gain on average across all benchmarks and surpasses other standard learning
methods, yet using 68x less training samples. Our findings highlight the
promise of TT-SI, demonstrating the potential of self-improvement algorithms at
test-time as a new paradigm for building more capable agents toward
self-evolution.

Abstract: Graph-level anomaly detection aims to identify anomalous graphs or subgraphs
within graph datasets, playing a vital role in various fields such as fraud
detection, review classification, and biochemistry. While Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) have made significant progress in this domain, existing methods rely
heavily on large amounts of labeled data, which is often unavailable in
real-world scenarios. Additionally, few-shot anomaly detection methods based on
GNNs are prone to noise interference, resulting in poor embedding quality and
reduced model robustness. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
meta-learning-based graph-level anomaly detection framework (MA-GAD),
incorporating a graph compression module that reduces the graph size,
mitigating noise interference while retaining essential node information. We
also leverage meta-learning to extract meta-anomaly information from similar
networks, enabling the learning of an initialization model that can rapidly
adapt to new tasks with limited samples. This improves the anomaly detection
performance on target graphs, and a bias network is used to enhance the
distinction between anomalous and normal nodes. Our experimental results, based
on four real-world biochemical datasets, demonstrate that MA-GAD outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods in graph-level anomaly detection under
few-shot conditions. Experiments on both graph anomaly and subgraph anomaly
detection tasks validate the framework's effectiveness on real-world datasets.

Abstract: Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images often suffer from noise
contamination, which degrades image quality and affects further analysis. This
research presents a complete approach to estimate their Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(SNR) and noise variance (NV), and enhance image quality using NV-guided Wiener

Linear Interpolation (FOL) method, Nearest Neighbourhood with First-Order
Linear Interpolation (NN+FOL) method, Non-Linear Least Squares Regression
(NLLSR) method, and Linear Least Squares Regression (LSR) method. It is shown
that LSR method to perform better than the rest. Then, Support Vector Machines
(SVM) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) are tested by pairing it with LSR.
In this test, the Optimizable GPR model shows the highest accuracy and it
stands as the most effective solution for NV estimation. Combining these
results lead to the proposed Adaptive Optimizable Gaussian Process Regression
Linear Least Squares Regression (AO-GPRLLSR) Filtering pipeline. The AO-GPRLLSR
method generated an estimated noise variance which served as input to NV-guided
Wiener filter for improving the quality of SEM images. The proposed method is
shown to achieve notable success in estimating SNR and NV of SEM images and
leads to lower Mean Squared Error (MSE) after the filtering process.

TL;DR: 提出MMM框架，通过整合三维量子化学信息（电子定位函数ELF）来改进药物表示学习，提升药物相互作用预测准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图神经网络方法使用简化的离散形式表示药物结构，无法充分捕捉分子结合亲和力和反应性，药物相互作用风险仍是临床决策支持系统的重要挑战

Method: MMM框架结合ELF生成的三维电子密度图和二分图编码器，同时捕捉全局电子特性和局部子结构相互作用

Result: 在MIMIC-III数据集上相比SafeDrug等基线模型，F1分数、Jaccard指数和DDI率均有统计学显著改善

Conclusion: 基于ELF的三维表示有潜力提高预测准确性，支持临床实践中更安全的组合药物处方

Abstract: Drug recommendation is an essential task in machine learning-based clinical
decision support systems. However, the risk of drug-drug interactions (DDI)
between co-prescribed medications remains a significant challenge. Previous
studies have used graph neural networks (GNNs) to represent drug structures.
Regardless, their simplified discrete forms cannot fully capture the molecular
binding affinity and reactivity. Therefore, we propose Multimodal DDI
Prediction with Molecular Electron Localization Function (ELF) Maps (MMM), a
novel framework that integrates three-dimensional (3D) quantum-chemical
information into drug representation learning. It generates 3D electron density
maps using the ELF. To capture both therapeutic relevance and interaction
risks, MMM combines ELF-derived features that encode global electronic
properties with a bipartite graph encoder that models local substructure
interactions. This design enables learning complementary characteristics of
drug molecules. We evaluate MMM in the MIMIC-III dataset (250 drugs, 442
substructures), comparing it with several baseline models. In particular, a
comparison with the GNN-based SafeDrug model demonstrates statistically
significant improvements in the F1-score (p = 0.0387), Jaccard (p = 0.0112),
and the DDI rate (p = 0.0386). These results demonstrate the potential of
ELF-based 3D representations to enhance prediction accuracy and support safer
combinatorial drug prescribing in clinical practice.

*Murtaza Rangwala,Farag Azzedin,Richard O. Sinnott,Rajkumar Buyya*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SketchGuard是一个用于去中心化联邦学习的拜占庭鲁棒防御框架，通过草图压缩技术将高维模型压缩为低维草图进行相似性比较，大幅降低了通信和计算开销，同时保持了与现有方法相同的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的拜占庭鲁棒DFL防御方法需要客户端在每轮训练中与所有邻居交换和比较完整的高维模型向量，产生了过高的通信和计算成本，阻碍了在web规模上的部署。

Method: 使用Count Sketch将d维模型压缩为k维草图（k << d）进行相似性比较，然后只从被接受的邻居处选择性获取完整模型，将每轮通信复杂度从O(d|N_i|)降低到O(k|N_i| + d|S_i|)。

Result: 在多个数据集、网络拓扑和攻击场景下的实验表明，SketchGuard保持了与最先进方法相同的鲁棒性，同时将计算时间减少高达82%，通信开销减少50-70%，且收益随模型维度和网络连接性呈乘性增长。

Conclusion: 草图压缩技术是实现在web规模上鲁棒DFL的基本推动因素，为大规模去中心化联邦学习提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) enables privacy-preserving
collaborative training without centralized servers, but remains vulnerable to
Byzantine attacks where malicious clients submit corrupted model updates.
Existing Byzantine-robust DFL defenses rely on similarity-based neighbor
screening that requires every client to exchange and compare complete
high-dimensional model vectors with all neighbors in each training round,
creating prohibitive communication and computational costs that prevent
deployment at web scale. We propose SketchGuard, a general framework that
decouples Byzantine filtering from model aggregation through sketch-based
neighbor screening. SketchGuard compresses $d$-dimensional models to
$k$-dimensional sketches ($k \ll d$) using Count Sketch for similarity
comparisons, then selectively fetches full models only from accepted neighbors,
reducing per-round communication complexity from $O(d|N_i|)$ to $O(k|N_i| +
d|S_i|)$, where $|N_i|$ is the neighbor count and $|S_i| \le |N_i|$ is the
accepted neighbor count. We establish rigorous convergence guarantees in both
strongly convex and non-convex settings, proving that Count Sketch compression
preserves Byzantine resilience with controlled degradation bounds where
approximation errors introduce only a $(1+O(\epsilon))$ factor in the effective
threshold parameter. Comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets,
network topologies, and attack scenarios demonstrate that SketchGuard maintains
identical robustness to state-of-the-art methods while reducing computation
time by up to 82% and communication overhead by 50-70% depending on filtering
effectiveness, with benefits scaling multiplicatively with model dimensionality
and network connectivity. These results establish the viability of sketch-based
compression as a fundamental enabler of robust DFL at web scale.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于脉冲神经网络(SNN)的自蒸馏方法，将SNN在时间步上的不同实例视为子模型，通过强-弱关系进行两种自蒸馏方案：强到弱和弱到强，有效提升SNN性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SNN性能仍落后于人工神经网络(ANN)，传统知识蒸馏方法依赖大型教师模型或引入额外训练开销。本文旨在利用SNN的时序特性实现高效自蒸馏。

Method: 将SNN在每个时间步的实例视为子模型，评估其输出置信度识别强弱关系，提出两种自蒸馏方案：Strong2Weak（强教师指导弱学生）和Weak2Strong（弱教师反向蒸馏强学生），并提供集成、同时和级联等灵活实现方式。

Result: 实验表明该方法有效提升了SNN的判别能力和整体性能，同时增强了对抗鲁棒性，受益于自蒸馏带来的稳定性。

Conclusion: 巧妙利用了SNN的时序特性，为如何高效训练高性能SNN提供了新思路。

Abstract: Brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) promise to be a low-power
alternative to computationally intensive artificial neural networks (ANNs),
although performance gaps persist. Recent studies have improved the performance
of SNNs through knowledge distillation, but rely on large teacher models or
introduce additional training overhead. In this paper, we show that SNNs can be
naturally deconstructed into multiple submodels for efficient
self-distillation. We treat each timestep instance of the SNN as a submodel and
evaluate its output confidence, thus efficiently identifying the strong and the
weak. Based on this strong and weak relationship, we propose two efficient
self-distillation schemes: (1) \textbf{Strong2Weak}: During training, the
stronger "teacher" guides the weaker "student", effectively improving overall
performance. (2) \textbf{Weak2Strong}: The weak serve as the "teacher",
distilling the strong in reverse with underlying dark knowledge, again yielding
significant performance gains. For both distillation schemes, we offer flexible
implementations such as ensemble, simultaneous, and cascade distillation.
Experiments show that our method effectively improves the discriminability and
overall performance of the SNN, while its adversarial robustness is also
enhanced, benefiting from the stability brought by self-distillation. This
ingeniously exploits the temporal properties of SNNs and provides insight into
how to efficiently train high-performance SNNs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了四项理论贡献，改进了基于PAC-Bayes边界的神经网络风险证书的可用性，包括伯努利分布KL散度的两个边界、基于隐式微分的高效方法、非可微目标边界优化，并在MNIST和CIFAR-10上实现了首个非平凡泛化边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进神经网络风险证书的可用性，特别是在不同经验风险范围内获得更紧密的显式边界，并将PAC-Bayesian风险证书优化整合到模型训练过程中。

Method: 1. 推导伯努利分布KL散度的两个边界；2. 基于隐式微分的形式化高效方法；3. 非可微目标（如0-1损失）边界优化方法；4. 在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上的实证评估。

Result: 实现了不同经验风险范围内最紧密的显式边界，成功将PAC-Bayesian风险证书优化整合到损失函数中，并在CIFAR-10上获得了神经网络的首个非平凡泛化边界。

Conclusion: 提出的理论贡献显著提高了PAC-Bayes风险证书的实用性和紧密度，特别是在CIFAR-10等复杂数据集上实现了突破性的非平凡泛化边界结果。

Abstract: This paper presents four theoretical contributions that improve the usability
of risk certificates for neural networks based on PAC-Bayes bounds. First, two
bounds on the KL divergence between Bernoulli distributions enable the
derivation of the tightest explicit bounds on the true risk of classifiers
across different ranges of empirical risk. The paper next focuses on the
formalization of an efficient methodology based on implicit differentiation
that enables the introduction of the optimization of PAC-Bayesian risk
certificates inside the loss/objective function used to fit the network/model.
The last contribution is a method to optimize bounds on non-differentiable
objectives such as the 0-1 loss. These theoretical contributions are
complemented with an empirical evaluation on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.
In fact, this paper presents the first non-vacuous generalization bounds on
CIFAR-10 for neural networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DISCO提出了一种新的模型评估方法，通过选择模型响应差异最大的样本来预测最终测试性能，避免了传统基于聚类的复杂锚点选择过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代机器学习模型评估成本过高，降低了包容性、减缓了创新周期并增加了环境影响。传统方法依赖聚类选择锚点子集，过程复杂且对设计选择敏感。

Method: DISCO方法选择模型响应差异最大的前k个样本，使用贪婪的样本级统计而非全局聚类，理论证明模型间分歧提供了信息理论上的最优选择规则。

Result: 在MMLU、Hellaswag、Winogrande和ARC等基准测试中，DISCO实现了最先进的性能预测结果。

Conclusion: 促进样本多样性并不重要，重要的是选择能最大化模型响应多样性的样本，DISCO方法概念更简单且在理论和实证上都表现出优势。

Abstract: Evaluating modern machine learning models has become prohibitively expensive.
Benchmarks such as LMMs-Eval and HELM demand thousands of GPU hours per model.
Costly evaluation reduces inclusivity, slows the cycle of innovation, and
worsens environmental impact. The typical approach follows two steps. First,
select an anchor subset of data. Second, train a mapping from the accuracy on
this subset to the final test result. The drawback is that anchor selection
depends on clustering, which can be complex and sensitive to design choices. We
argue that promoting diversity among samples is not essential; what matters is
to select samples that $\textit{maximise diversity in model responses}$. Our
method, $\textbf{Diversifying Sample Condensation (DISCO)}$, selects the top-k
samples with the greatest model disagreements. This uses greedy, sample-wise
statistics rather than global clustering. The approach is conceptually simpler.
From a theoretical view, inter-model disagreement provides an
information-theoretically optimal rule for such greedy selection.
$\textbf{DISCO}$ shows empirical gains over prior methods, achieving
state-of-the-art results in performance prediction across MMLU, Hellaswag,
Winogrande, and ARC. Code is available here:

TL;DR: 提出了PRESCRIBE框架，用于单细胞扰动预测中联合估计模型不确定性和数据不确定性，通过置信度评分提高预测可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单细胞扰动预测需要评估预测可靠性，特别是对于训练数据中未见过的基因。预测效果取决于基因相似性（模型不确定性）和训练数据质量（数据不确定性）。

Method: 提出了PRESCRIBE（PREdicting Single-Cell Response wIth Bayesian Estimation），一个多变量深度证据回归框架，能够联合测量两种不确定性来源。

Result: PRESCRIBE能够有效估计每个预测的置信度评分，该评分与经验准确性高度相关，相比基线方法实现了超过3%的稳定准确率提升。

Conclusion: 该框架能够过滤不可靠的预测结果，为单细胞扰动预测提供了可靠的置信度评估方法。

Abstract: In single-cell perturbation prediction, a central task is to forecast the
effects of perturbing a gene unseen in the training data. The efficacy of such
predictions depends on two factors: (1) the similarity of the target gene to
those covered in the training data, which informs model (epistemic)
uncertainty, and (2) the quality of the corresponding training data, which
reflects data (aleatoric) uncertainty. Both factors are critical for
determining the reliability of a prediction, particularly as gene perturbation
is an inherently stochastic biochemical process. In this paper, we propose
PRESCRIBE (PREdicting Single-Cell Response wIth Bayesian Estimation), a
multivariate deep evidential regression framework designed to measure both
sources of uncertainty jointly. Our analysis demonstrates that PRESCRIBE
effectively estimates a confidence score for each prediction, which strongly
correlates with its empirical accuracy. This capability enables the filtering
of untrustworthy results, and in our experiments, it achieves steady accuracy
improvements of over 3% compared to comparable baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了多Gossip步骤(MGS)在去中心化训练中的作用，通过稳定性分析推导了泛化误差和超额误差的上界，揭示了MGS能指数级减少优化误差但无法完全消除与中心化训练的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 去中心化训练虽然通信效率高，但性能往往不如中心化训练。MGS作为桥梁能显著缩小这一差距，但其理论有效性和能否完全消除差距仍是未解问题。

Method: 使用稳定性分析推导MGS的泛化误差和超额误差上界，分析学习率、数据异质性、节点数量等因素对泛化性能的影响，并在CIFAR数据集上进行实验验证。

Result: 1) MGS以指数速率减少优化误差界，从而指数级收紧泛化误差界；2) 即使MGS趋于无穷，与中心化mini-batch SGD仍存在不可忽略的泛化误差差距；3) 提供了首个在非凸设置下无梯度有界假设的统一分析。

Conclusion: MGS能显著改善去中心化训练性能，但理论证明无法完全消除与中心化训练的差距，为去中心化训练提供了重要的理论指导。

Abstract: Decentralized training removes the centralized server, making it a
communication-efficient approach that can significantly improve training
efficiency, but it often suffers from degraded performance compared to
centralized training. Multi-Gossip Steps (MGS) serve as a simple yet effective
bridge between decentralized and centralized training, significantly reducing
experiment performance gaps. However, the theoretical reasons for its
effectiveness and whether this gap can be fully eliminated by MGS remain open
questions. In this paper, we derive upper bounds on the generalization error
and excess error of MGS using stability analysis, systematically answering
these two key questions. 1). Optimization Error Reduction: MGS reduces the
optimization error bound at an exponential rate, thereby exponentially
tightening the generalization error bound and enabling convergence to better
solutions. 2). Gap to Centralization: Even as MGS approaches infinity, a
non-negligible gap in generalization error remains compared to centralized
mini-batch SGD ($\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{c\beta}{c\beta +1}}/{n m})$ in
centralized and $\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{2c\beta}{2c\beta +2}}/{n
m^{\frac{1}{2c\beta +2}}})$ in decentralized). Furthermore, we provide the
first unified analysis of how factors like learning rate, data heterogeneity,
node count, per-node sample size, and communication topology impact the
generalization of MGS under non-convex settings without the bounded gradients
assumption, filling a critical theoretical gap in decentralized training.
Finally, promising experiments on CIFAR datasets support our theoretical
findings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文首次揭示了现代LLM剪枝方法可能被恶意利用的安全隐患，攻击者可以构建看似良性的模型，但在剪枝后会表现出恶意行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然模型剪枝在减少LLM内存占用方面效用显著，但其安全影响尚未得到充分探索，特别是剪枝可能被恶意利用的风险。

Method: 攻击者计算每个参数被剪枝可能性的代理指标，将恶意行为注入到不太可能被剪枝的参数中，然后使用可能被剪枝的参数修复模型，从而在未剪枝模型中抵消注入的行为。

Result: 在五个模型上的广泛评估显示，经过vLLM中的任何剪枝方法处理后，模型在多种攻击场景中都表现出强烈的恶意行为（越狱成功率高达95.7%，良性指令拒绝率98.7%，目标内容注入成功率99.5%）。

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了关键部署时安全漏洞，强调了在模型压缩中加强安全意识的紧迫性。

Abstract: Model pruning, i.e., removing a subset of model weights, has become a
prominent approach to reducing the memory footprint of large language models
(LLMs) during inference. Notably, popular inference engines, such as vLLM,
enable users to conveniently prune downloaded models before they are deployed.
While the utility and efficiency of pruning methods have improved
significantly, the security implications of pruning remain underexplored. In
this work, for the first time, we show that modern LLM pruning methods can be
maliciously exploited. In particular, an adversary can construct a model that
appears benign yet, once pruned, exhibits malicious behaviors. Our method is
based on the idea that the adversary can compute a proxy metric that estimates
how likely each parameter is to be pruned. With this information, the adversary
can first inject a malicious behavior into those parameters that are unlikely
to be pruned. Then, they can repair the model by using parameters that are
likely to be pruned, effectively canceling out the injected behavior in the
unpruned model. We demonstrate the severity of our attack through extensive
evaluation on five models; after any of the pruning in vLLM are applied
(Magnitude, Wanda, and SparseGPT), it consistently exhibits strong malicious
behaviors in a diverse set of attack scenarios (success rates of up to $95.7\%$
for jailbreak, $98.7\%$ for benign instruction refusal, and $99.5\%$ for
targeted content injection). Our results reveal a critical deployment-time
security gap and underscore the urgent need for stronger security awareness in
model compression.

Conclusion: 检查点回收方法为经济高效的大语言模型预训练奠定了基础

Abstract: The rapidly increasing computational cost of pretraining Large Language
Models necessitates more efficient approaches. Numerous computational costs
have been invested in existing well-trained checkpoints, but many of them
remain underutilized due to engineering constraints or limited model capacity.
To efficiently reuse this "sunk" cost, we propose to recycle pretrained
checkpoints by expanding their parameter counts and continuing training. We
propose orthogonal growth method well-suited for converged Mixture-of-Experts
model: interpositional layer copying for depth growth and expert duplication
with injected noise for width growth. To determine the optimal timing for such
growth across checkpoints sequences, we perform comprehensive scaling
experiments revealing that the final accuracy has a strong positive correlation
with the amount of sunk cost, indicating that greater prior investment leads to
better performance. We scale our approach to models with 70B parameters and
over 1T training tokens, achieving 10.66% accuracy gain over training from
scratch under the same additional compute budget. Our checkpoint recycling
approach establishes a foundation for economically efficient large language
model pretraining.

Conclusion: 该框架显著加速了PPR计算，解决了文献中的开放猜想，实验验证了早期收敛的高效性

Abstract: This work proposes a novel framework based on nested evolving set processes
to accelerate Personalized PageRank (PPR) computation. At each stage of the
process, we employ a localized inexact proximal point iteration to solve a
simplified linear system. We show that the time complexity of such localized
methods is upper bounded by $\min\{\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(R^2/\epsilon^2),
\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(m)\}$ to obtain an $\epsilon$-approximation of the PPR
vector, where $m$ denotes the number of edges in the graph and $R$ is a
constant defined via nested evolving set processes. Furthermore, the algorithms
induced by our framework require solving only
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\sqrt{\alpha})$ such linear systems, where $\alpha$ is
the damping factor. When $1/\epsilon^2\ll m$, this implies the existence of an
algorithm that computes an $\ epsilon $-approximation of the PPR vector with an
overall time complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(R^2 /
(\sqrt{\alpha}\epsilon^2)\right)$, independent of the underlying graph size.
Our result resolves an open conjecture from existing literature. Experimental
results on real-world graphs validate the efficiency of our methods,
demonstrating significant convergence in the early stages.

Abstract: Radio maps are essential for enhancing wireless communications and
localization. However, existing methods for constructing radio maps typically
require costly calibration processes to collect location-labeled channel state
information (CSI) datasets. This paper aims to recover the data collection
trajectory directly from the channel propagation sequence, eliminating the need
for location calibration. The key idea is to employ a hidden Markov model
(HMM)-based framework to conditionally model the channel propagation matrix,
while simultaneously modeling the location correlation in the trajectory. The
primary challenges involve modeling the complex relationship between channel
propagation in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks and geographical
locations, and addressing both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS)
indoor conditions. In this paper, we propose an HMM-based framework that
jointly characterizes the conditional propagation model and the evolution of
the user trajectory. Specifically, the channel propagation in MIMO networks is
modeled separately in terms of power, delay, and angle, with distinct models
for LOS and NLOS conditions. The user trajectory is modeled using a
Gaussian-Markov model. The parameters for channel propagation, the mobility
model, and LOS/NLOS classification are optimized simultaneously. Experimental
validation using simulated MIMO-Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing
(OFDM) networks with a multi-antenna uniform linear arrays (ULA) configuration
demonstrates that the proposed method achieves an average localization accuracy
of 0.65 meters in an indoor environment, covering both LOS and NLOS regions.
Moreover, the constructed radio map enables localization with a reduced error
compared to conventional supervised methods, such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN),
support vector machine (SVM), and deep neural network (DNN).

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型合并虽然有效，但存在严重的安全风险，特别是容易受到后门攻击。现有研究显示单个微调模型的后门可以控制最终合并模型的输出，这促使作者深入理解后门攻击的本质。

Method: 提出了后门向量(BV)框架，将攻击视为权重差异；开发了稀疏后门向量(SBV)来增强攻击效果；提出了注入后门向量减法(IBVS)作为轻量级防御方法。

Result: SBV方法超越了先前的攻击效果，是首个利用合并来提升后门有效性的方法；IBVS提供了有效的防御，即使在完全未知后门威胁的情况下也能保持效果。

Conclusion: 通过将后门攻击形式化为任务向量，不仅加深了对攻击机制的理解，还开发出了更有效的攻击和防御方法，揭示了模型合并中固有的安全漏洞。

Abstract: Model merging (MM) recently emerged as an effective method for combining
large deep learning models. However, it poses significant security risks.
Recent research shows that it is highly susceptible to backdoor attacks, which
introduce a hidden trigger into a single fine-tuned model instance that allows
the adversary to control the output of the final merged model at inference
time. In this work, we propose a simple framework for understanding backdoor
attacks by treating the attack itself as a task vector. $Backdoor\ Vector\
(BV)$ is calculated as the difference between the weights of a fine-tuned
backdoored model and fine-tuned clean model. BVs reveal new insights into
attacks understanding and a more effective framework to measure their
similarity and transferability. Furthermore, we propose a novel method that
enhances backdoor resilience through merging dubbed $Sparse\ Backdoor\ Vector\
(SBV)$ that combines multiple attacks into a single one. We identify the core
vulnerability behind backdoor threats in MM: $inherent\ triggers$ that exploit
adversarial weaknesses in the base model. To counter this, we propose
$Injection\ BV\ Subtraction\ (IBVS)$ - an assumption-free defense against
backdoors in MM. Our results show that SBVs surpass prior attacks and is the
first method to leverage merging to improve backdoor effectiveness. At the same
time, IBVS provides a lightweight, general defense that remains effective even
when the backdoor threat is entirely unknown.

*Akira Ito,Masanori Yamada,Daiki Chijiwa,Atsutoshi Kumagai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究表明，仅通过加宽模型而不需要参数置换，配合合适的softmax温度校准，即可实现线性模式连接性(LMC)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究认为实现LMC需要参数置换搜索和足够宽的模型，本文旨在验证仅通过模型加宽是否足以实现LMC。

Method: 引入层间指数加权连接性(LEWC)分析中间层输出，并使用softmax温度校准来促进LMC。

Result: 实证证明仅加宽模型即可实现LMC，无需参数置换，且合并模型的输出可表示为原始模型输出的指数加权和。

Conclusion: 模型加宽不仅促进非线性模式连接性，也显著增加实现线性模式连接性的可能性。

Abstract: Recently, Ainsworth et al. empirically demonstrated that, given two
independently trained models, applying a parameter permutation that preserves
the input-output behavior allows the two models to be connected by a low-loss
linear path. When such a path exists, the models are said to achieve linear
mode connectivity (LMC). Prior studies, including Ainsworth et al., have
reported that achieving LMC requires not only an appropriate permutation search
but also sufficiently wide models (e.g., a 32 $\times$ width multiplier for
ResNet-20). This is broadly believed to be because increasing the model width
ensures a large enough space of candidate permutations, increasing the chance
of finding one that yields LMC. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that,
even without any permutations, simply widening the models is sufficient for
achieving LMC when using a suitable softmax temperature calibration. We further
explain why this phenomenon arises by analyzing intermediate layer outputs.
Specifically, we introduce layerwise exponentially weighted connectivity
(LEWC), which states that the output of each layer of the merged model can be
represented as an exponentially weighted sum of the outputs of the
corresponding layers of the original models. Consequently the merged model's
output matches that of an ensemble of the original models, which facilitates
LMC. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to show that widening
the model not only facilitates nonlinear mode connectivity, as suggested in
prior research, but also significantly increases the possibility of achieving
linear mode connectivity.

*Gunjun Lee,Jiwon Kim,Jaiyoung Park,Younjoo Lee,Jung Ho Ahn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出分层预填充调度方法，将transformer层组作为主要调度单元，通过垂直分区和交错调度消除MoE模型中的权重重载开销，显著降低延迟和能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于分块预填充的调度方法虽然能稳定token间延迟，但在MoE模型中会导致专家权重重复加载，增加内存流量和能耗。

Method: 将模型垂直分区为连续层组，在层组间交错进行预填充和解码操作，以层而非token为调度单位。

Result: 降低片外带宽需求，TTFT减少70%，端到端延迟降低41%，每token能耗降低22%，改善TTFT-TBT帕累托边界。

Conclusion: 从token到层的调度轴转变，为共置环境中的高效、节能LLM服务开启了新的操作机制。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) inference in production must meet stringent
service-level objectives for both time-to-first-token (TTFT) and
time-between-token (TBT) while maximizing throughput under fixed compute,
memory, and interconnect budgets. Modern serving systems adopt stall-free
scheduling techniques such as chunked prefill, which splits long prompt
processing along the token dimension and interleaves prefill with ongoing
decode iterations. While effective at stabilizing TBT, chunked prefill incurs
substantial overhead in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models: redundant expert
weight loads increase memory traffic by up to 39% and inflate energy
consumption. We propose layered prefill, a new scheduling paradigm that treats
transformer layer groups as the primary scheduling unit. By vertically
partitioning the model into contiguous layer groups and interleaving prefill
and decode across the groups, layered prefill sustains stall-free decoding
while eliminating chunk-induced MoE weight reloads. It reduces off-chip
bandwidth demand, lowering TTFT by up to 70%, End-to-End latency by 41% and
per-token energy by up to 22%. Evaluations show that layered prefill
consistently improves the TTFT--TBT Pareto frontier over chunked prefill,
reducing expert-load traffic and energy cost while maintaining stall-free
decoding. Overall, shifting the scheduling axis from tokens to layers unlocks a
new operating regime for high-efficiency, energy-aware LLM serving in
co-located environments.

TL;DR: 提出了Subject-Conditioned Layer来解决EEG解码中的主体特定分布偏移问题，该层通过分解权重为共享组件和低秩修正来实现个性化适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主体特定的分布偏移是开发EEG解码基础模型的重要障碍，需要解决主体间变异性问题。

Method: 设计自适应层作为标准线性或卷积层的替代，将权重分解为共享的主体不变组件和轻量级低秩修正组件。

Result: 配备该层的模型在性能上优于仅共享权重的模型和单独训练的主体特定模型的平均值。

Conclusion: Subject-Conditioned Layer为构建有效的跨主体EEG基础模型提供了实用且可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Subject-specific distribution shifts represent an important obstacle to the
development of foundation models for EEG decoding. To address this, we propose
Subject-Conditioned Layer,, an adaptive layer designed as a drop-in replacement
for standard linear or convolutional layers in any neural network architecture.
Our layer captures subject-specific variability by decomposing its weights into
a shared, subject-invariant component and a lightweight, low-rank correction
unique to each subject. This explicit separation of general knowledge from
personalized adaptation allows existing models to become robust to subject
shifts. Empirically, models equipped with our layer outperform both a
shared-weight-only model (subject-agnostic model) and the average of
individually trained subject-specific models. Consequently, the
Subject-Conditioned Layer, offers a practical and scalable path towards
building effective cross-subject foundation models for EEG.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了近似领域遗忘(ADU)这一新问题设定，旨在从预训练视觉语言模型中移除特定领域知识，同时保持其他领域的识别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练视觉语言模型在保持广泛泛化能力的同时，往往包含与下游任务无关的信息，这可能导致计算效率低下和信息泄露风险。现有方法主要关注类别遗忘，但在实际应用中仅遗忘对象类别往往不够，需要更细粒度的领域级遗忘。

Method: 提出一种新方法，通过显式解耦领域分布并自适应捕获实例特定的领域信息来解决领域分布高度纠缠的问题。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在基于VLM调优技术构建的基线方法上表现更优。

Conclusion: 该方法为视觉语言模型中的实用和细粒度遗忘铺平了道路。

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong generalization
capabilities, enabling them to recognize a wide range of objects across diverse
domains without additional training. However, they often retain irrelevant
information beyond the requirements of specific downstream tasks, raising
concerns about computational efficiency and potential information leakage. This
has motivated growing interest in approximate unlearning, which aims to
selectively remove unnecessary knowledge while preserving overall model
performance. Existing approaches to approximate unlearning have primarily
focused on class unlearning, where a VLM is retrained to fail to recognize
specified object classes while maintaining accuracy for others. However, merely
forgetting object classes is often insufficient in practical applications. For
instance, an autonomous driving system should accurately recognize real cars
while avoiding misrecognition of illustrated cars depicted in roadside
advertisements as real cars, which could be hazardous. In this paper, we
introduce Approximate Domain Unlearning (ADU), a novel problem setting that
requires reducing recognition accuracy for images from specified domains (e.g.,
illustration) while preserving accuracy for other domains (e.g., real). ADU
presents new technical challenges: due to the strong domain generalization
capability of pre-trained VLMs, domain distributions are highly entangled in
the feature space, making naive approaches based on penalizing target domains
ineffective. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel approach that
explicitly disentangles domain distributions and adaptively captures
instance-specific domain information. Extensive experiments show that our
approach outperforms baselines built upon VLM tuning techniques, paving the way
for practical and fine-grained unlearning in VLMs. Code:

TL;DR: 提出了AEPO方法解决强化学习微调中的熵崩溃问题，通过温度调节和REINFORCE策略梯度实现精确的熵控制，揭示了熵与性能的非单调关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GRPO方法存在熵崩溃问题，导致探索消失和策略过早收敛，而现有的熵正则化方法只能部分缓解此问题，同时引入偏差和不稳定性。

Method: AEPO通过用温度调整分布的REINFORCE策略梯度替换熵奖励，并通过温度调节稳定熵，包含三个关键设计：策略梯度作为正则化、分布作为正则化、REINFORCE作为正则化。

Result: AEPO能够稳定熵在任意目标水平，有效消除GRPO中的熵崩溃；揭示了熵与性能的非单调关系；提供了更广泛的RFT范式。

Conclusion: AEPO解决了熵控制问题，阐明了熵、探索和推理性能之间的关系，并为强化学习微调提供了更通用的框架。

Abstract: Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) is essential for enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLM), yet the widely adopted Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffers from entropy collapse, where
entropy monotonically decreases, exploration vanishes, and policies converge
prematurely. Existing entropy-regularized methods only partially alleviate this
issue while introducing bias and instability, leaving entropy control
unresolved and the connection between entropy, exploration, and performance
unclear. We propose Arbitrary Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO), which
eliminates entropy collapse by replacing entropy bonuses with REINFORCE policy
gradient on temperature-adjusted distributions and stabilizing entropy through
temperature regulation. AEPO integrates three key designs: policy gradient as
regularization, distribution as regularization, and REINFORCE as
regularization, enabling precise entropy control without distorting
optimization. Experiments demonstrate three major contributions: AEPO (1)
stabilizes entropy at arbitrary target levels, effectively removing collapse in
GRPO; (2) reveals a non-monotonic relation where performance first improves
then declines with increasing entropy, clarifying the link between entropy,
exploration, and reasoning; and (3) generalizes beyond entropy, providing a
broader RFT paradigm where superior target distributions can serve as REINFORCE
regularizers.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用推理模型中的熵作为置信信号，挖掘高级后训练优化中出现的置信度校准特性，以提高token效率。

Method: 使用token级logprobs计算香农熵作为置信度信号，实现早期停止机制，通过少量示例计算模型特定的熵阈值。

Result: 在推理优化模型家族中实现25-50%计算成本节省，同时保持准确性，证明高级推理模型能早期识别正确答案。

Conclusion: 置信度机制是现代后训练推理系统区别于前代模型的关键特征，熵框架可有效利用这一特性提升效率。

Abstract: We introduce a simple, yet novel entropy-based framework to drive token
efficiency in large language models during reasoning tasks. Our approach uses
Shannon entropy from token-level logprobs as a confidence signal to enable
early stopping, achieving 25-50% computational savings while maintaining task
accuracy. Crucially, we demonstrate that entropy-based confidence calibration
represents an emergent property of advanced post-training optimization present
in modern reasoning models but notably absent in standard instruction-tuned and
pre-trained models (Llama 3.3 70B). We show that the entropy threshold to stop
reasoning varies from model to model but can be calculated easily in one shot
using only a few examples from existing reasoning datasets. Our results
indicate that advanced reasoning models often know that they've gotten a
correct answer early on, and that this emergent confidence awareness can be
exploited to save tokens and reduce latency. The framework demonstrates
consistent performance across reasoning-optimized model families with 25-50%
computational cost reduction while preserving accuracy, revealing that
confidence mechanisms represent a distinguishing characteristic of modern
post-trained reasoning systems versus their predecessors.

Motivation: 现有的分布式无监督多源域自适应方法通常假设源域数量较少，无法有效扩展到大量异构域，导致计算开销高或性能不稳定。

Method: 提出两个关键组件：(1)组间差异最小化目标，无需二次计算即可近似完整成对域对齐；(2)温度控制的质心加权策略，根据与目标域的对齐程度动态优先处理源域。

Result: 在标准基准测试中取得竞争性或最先进的结果，在多样化多源设置中显著优于先前方法，特别是在其他方法无法收敛的情况下。

Conclusion: GALA框架能够在大规模异构源域场景下实现稳定、可并行化的训练，解决了现有方法在可扩展性和鲁棒性方面的局限性。

Abstract: Unsupervised multi-source domain adaptation (UMDA) aims to learn models that
generalize to an unlabeled target domain by leveraging labeled data from
multiple, diverse source domains. While distributed UMDA methods address
privacy constraints by avoiding raw data sharing, existing approaches typically
assume a small number of sources and fail to scale effectively. Increasing the
number of heterogeneous domains often makes existing methods impractical,
leading to high computational overhead or unstable performance. We propose
GALA, a scalable and robust federated UMDA framework that introduces two key
components: (1) a novel inter-group discrepancy minimization objective that
efficiently approximates full pairwise domain alignment without quadratic
computation; and (2) a temperature-controlled, centroid-based weighting
strategy that dynamically prioritizes source domains based on alignment with
the target. Together, these components enable stable and parallelizable
training across large numbers of heterogeneous sources. To evaluate performance
in high-diversity scenarios, we introduce Digit-18, a new benchmark comprising
18 digit datasets with varied synthetic and real-world domain shifts. Extensive
experiments show that GALA consistently achieves competitive or
state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks and significantly outperforms
prior methods in diverse multi-source settings where others fail to converge.

Method: 采用共享输入编码器和双解码器架构：一个非自回归解码器学习潜在双向生物特征，一个自回归解码器利用这些特征合成序列。通过跨解码器注意力模块实现双向特征的迭代查询和整合。

Result: 在九物种肽测序基准测试中，模型显著超越了自回归和非自回归基线方法，成功融合了自回归的稳定性与非自回归的上下文感知能力。

Conclusion: 该研究推进了生物序列建模技术，为增强自回归模型的双向理解能力提供了一种新颖的架构范式，在复杂序列生成任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models, common in sequence generation, are limited in
many biological tasks such as de novo peptide sequencing and protein modeling
by their unidirectional nature, failing to capture crucial global bidirectional
token dependencies. Non-Autoregressive (NAR) models offer holistic,
bidirectional representations but face challenges with generative coherence and
scalability. To transcend this, we propose a hybrid framework enhancing AR
generation by dynamically integrating rich contextual information from
non-autoregressive mechanisms. Our approach couples a shared input encoder with
two decoders: a non-autoregressive one learning latent bidirectional biological
features, and an AR decoder synthesizing the biological sequence by leveraging
these bidirectional features. A novel cross-decoder attention module enables
the AR decoder to iteratively query and integrate these bidirectional features,
enriching its predictions. This synergy is cultivated via a tailored training
strategy with importance annealing for balanced objectives and cross-decoder
gradient blocking for stable, focused learning. Evaluations on a demanding
nine-species benchmark of de novo peptide sequencing show that our model
substantially surpasses AR and NAR baselines. It uniquely harmonizes AR
stability with NAR contextual awareness, delivering robust, superior
performance on diverse downstream data. This research advances biological
sequence modeling techniques and contributes a novel architectural paradigm for
augmenting AR models with enhanced bidirectional understanding for complex
sequence generation. Code is available at https://github.com/BEAM-Labs/denovo.

TL;DR: 提出MORE框架，通过直接重新平衡模型参数空间来解决长尾识别问题，不增加模型复杂度或推理成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长尾识别在深度学习和基础模型微调中普遍存在且具有挑战性，现有方法在广泛场景中难以取得一致改进

Method: 引入低秩参数组件来调解参数空间分配，使用定制损失和正弦重加权调度，但不增加整体模型复杂度

Result: 在多样化的长尾基准测试中显著改善泛化能力，特别是对尾部类别，并能有效补充现有不平衡缓解方法

Conclusion: MORE作为长尾设置中的强大即插即用模块具有巨大潜力

Abstract: Long-tailed recognition is ubiquitous and challenging in deep learning and
even in the downstream finetuning of foundation models, since the skew class
distribution generally prevents the model generalization to the tail classes.
Despite the promise of previous methods from the perspectives of data
augmentation, loss rebalancing and decoupled training etc., consistent
improvement in the broad scenarios like multi-label long-tailed recognition is
difficult. In this study, we dive into the essential model capacity impact
under long-tailed context, and propose a novel framework, Model Rebalancing
(MORE), which mitigates imbalance by directly rebalancing the model's parameter
space. Specifically, MORE introduces a low-rank parameter component to mediate
the parameter space allocation guided by a tailored loss and sinusoidal
reweighting schedule, but without increasing the overall model complexity or
inference costs. Extensive experiments on diverse long-tailed benchmarks,
spanning multi-class and multi-label tasks, demonstrate that MORE significantly
improves generalization, particularly for tail classes, and effectively
complements existing imbalance mitigation methods. These results highlight
MORE's potential as a robust plug-and-play module in long-tailed settings.

Motivation: 现实数据集常同时存在类别不平衡和标签噪声问题，单独处理方法难以协同，因为区分真实尾部样本和噪声数据很困难，导致优化策略冲突。

Method: 提出双粒度Sinkhorn蒸馏(D-SINK)，使用最优传输优化的代理标签分配，将目标模型的样本级预测与噪声鲁棒辅助模型对齐，将类别分布与不平衡鲁棒辅助模型对齐。

Result: 在基准数据集上的大量实验表明，D-SINK显著提高了鲁棒性，在长尾噪声数据学习中取得了强大的实证性能。

Conclusion: 通过协同利用专门处理单一问题的'弱'辅助模型，可以有效解决类别不平衡和标签噪声的共现挑战，且两者的鲁棒机制在原理上具有互补性而不冲突。

Abstract: Real-world datasets for deep learning frequently suffer from the co-occurring
challenges of class imbalance and label noise, hindering model performance.
While methods exist for each issue, effectively combining them is non-trivial,
as distinguishing genuine tail samples from noisy data proves difficult, often
leading to conflicting optimization strategies. This paper presents a novel
perspective: instead of primarily developing new complex techniques from
scratch, we explore synergistically leveraging well-established, individually
'weak' auxiliary models - specialized for tackling either class imbalance or
label noise but not both. This view is motivated by the insight that class
imbalance (a distributional-level concern) and label noise (a sample-level
concern) operate at different granularities, suggesting that robustness
mechanisms for each can in principle offer complementary strengths without
conflict. We propose Dual-granularity Sinkhorn Distillation (D-SINK), a novel
framework that enhances dual robustness by distilling and integrating
complementary insights from such 'weak', single-purpose auxiliary models.
Specifically, D-SINK uses an optimal transport-optimized surrogate label
allocation to align the target model's sample-level predictions with a
noise-robust auxiliary and its class distributions with an imbalance-robust
one. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that D-SINK
significantly improves robustness and achieves strong empirical performance in
learning from long-tailed noisy data.

Abstract: In the shipping industry, fuel consumption and emissions are critical factors
due to their significant impact on economic efficiency and environmental
sustainability. Accurate prediction of ship fuel consumption is essential for
further optimization of maritime operations. However, heterogeneous
methodologies and limited high-quality datasets hinder direct comparison of
modeling approaches. This paper makes three key contributions: (1) we introduce
and release a new dataset
(https://huggingface.co/datasets/krohnedigital/FuelCast) comprising operational
and environmental data from three ships; (2) we define a standardized benchmark
covering tabular regression and time-series regression (3) we investigate the
application of in-context learning for ship consumption modeling using the
TabPFN foundation model - a first in this domain to our knowledge. Our results
demonstrate strong performance across all evaluated models, supporting the
feasibility of onboard, data-driven fuel prediction. Models incorporating
environmental conditions consistently outperform simple polynomial baselines
relying solely on vessel speed. TabPFN slightly outperforms other techniques,
highlighting the potential of foundation models with in-context learning
capabilities for tabular prediction. Furthermore, including temporal context
improves accuracy.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful paradigm for learning to make
sequences of decisions. However, RL has yet to be fully leveraged in robotics,
principally due to its lack of scalability. Offline RL offers a promising
avenue by training agents on large, diverse datasets, avoiding the costly
real-world interactions of online RL. Scaling offline RL to increasingly
complex datasets requires expressive generative models such as diffusion and
flow matching. However, existing methods typically depend on either
backpropagation through time (BPTT), which is computationally prohibitive, or
policy distillation, which introduces compounding errors and limits scalability
to larger base policies. In this paper, we consider the question of how to
develop a scalable offline RL approach without relying on distillation or
backpropagation through time. We introduce Expressive Value Learning for
Offline Reinforcement Learning (EVOR): a scalable offline RL approach that
integrates both expressive policies and expressive value functions. EVOR learns
an optimal, regularized Q-function via flow matching during training. At
inference-time, EVOR performs inference-time policy extraction via rejection
sampling against the expressive value function, enabling efficient
optimization, regularization, and compute-scalable search without retraining.
Empirically, we show that EVOR outperforms baselines on a diverse set of
offline RL tasks, demonstrating the benefit of integrating expressive value
learning into offline RL.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) are interpretable models that predict the
target variable through high-level human-understandable concepts, allowing
users to intervene on mispredicted concepts to adjust the final output. While
recent work has shown that modeling dependencies between concepts can improve
CBM performance, especially under interventions, such approaches typically
require retraining the entire model, which may be infeasible when access to the
original data or compute is limited. In this paper, we introduce Post-hoc
Stochastic Concept Bottleneck Models (PSCBMs), a lightweight method that
augments any pre-trained CBM with a multivariate normal distribution over
concepts by adding only a small covariance-prediction module, without
retraining the backbone model. We propose two training strategies and show on
real-world data that PSCBMs consistently match or improve both concept and
target accuracy over standard CBMs at test time. Furthermore, we show that due
to the modeling of concept dependencies, PSCBMs perform much better than CBMs
under interventions, while remaining far more efficient than retraining a
similar stochastic model from scratch.

*Michal Koren,Or Peretz,Tai Dinh,Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了不确定性感知马尔可夫决策过程（UAMDP），将贝叶斯预测、后验采样强化学习和条件风险价值约束规划相结合，用于高风险环境中的顺序决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在波动性高、风险大的顺序决策环境中，仅最大化期望收益是不够的，需要系统性的不确定性管理方法。

Method: UAMDP框架结合贝叶斯动态预测、Thompson采样和条件风险价值约束规划，在闭环中更新潜在动态信念，采样可能未来并优化风险约束策略。

Result: 在高频股票交易和零售库存控制两个领域，相比深度学习基线，UAMDP将长期预测准确率提升25%（RMSE）和32%（sMAPE），交易夏普比率从1.54提升至1.74，最大回撤减半。

Conclusion: 整合校准概率建模、后验不确定性探索和风险感知控制，能够实现更稳健、可泛化的安全且盈利的顺序决策方法。

Abstract: Sequential decisions in volatile, high-stakes settings require more than
maximizing expected return; they require principled uncertainty management.
This paper presents the Uncertainty-Aware Markov Decision Process (UAMDP), a
unified framework that couples Bayesian forecasting, posterior-sampling
reinforcement learning, and planning under a conditional value-at-risk (CVaR)
constraint. In a closed loop, the agent updates its beliefs over latent
dynamics, samples plausible futures via Thompson sampling, and optimizes
policies subject to preset risk tolerances. We establish regret bounds that
converge to the Bayes-optimal benchmark under standard regularity conditions.
We evaluate UAMDP in two domains-high-frequency equity trading and retail
inventory control-both marked by structural uncertainty and economic
volatility. Relative to strong deep learning baselines, UAMDP improves
long-horizon forecasting accuracy (RMSE decreases by up to 25\% and sMAPE by
32\%), and these gains translate into economic performance: the trading Sharpe
ratio rises from 1.54 to 1.74 while maximum drawdown is roughly halved. These
results show that integrating calibrated probabilistic modeling, exploration
aligned with posterior uncertainty, and risk-aware control yields a robust,
generalizable approach to safer and more profitable sequential decision-making.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了DMPO（分布匹配策略优化），一种专门为扩散大语言模型设计的强化学习微调方法，通过交叉熵优化匹配模型策略分布与最优奖励倾斜分布，显著提升推理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型(dLLMs)是自回归大语言模型(AR-LLMs)的有前景替代方案，具有更高推理吞吐量。但需要专门针对dLLMs特性的强化学习算法来达到与AR-LLMs相当的性能

Method: DMPO方法通过交叉熵优化匹配dLLM策略分布与最优奖励倾斜分布，针对小批量训练挑战提出了新颖的权重基线减法技术

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中表现优异，无需监督微调，相比之前SOTA基线准确率提升高达42.9%，相比基础模型提升55.8%

Conclusion: 分布匹配框架在提升dLLMs推理能力方面非常有效，DMPO为dLLMs提供了专门的强化学习解决方案

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are promising alternatives to
autoregressive large language models (AR-LLMs), as they potentially allow
higher inference throughput. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a crucial component
for dLLMs to achieve comparable performance with AR-LLMs on important tasks,
such as reasoning. However, RL algorithms that are well-suited for dLLMs'
unique characteristics have yet to be developed. This paper proposes
Distribution Matching Policy Optimization (DMPO), a principled and
theoretically grounded RL fine-tuning method specifically designed to enhance
the reasoning capabilities of dLLMs by matching the dLLM policy distribution to
the optimal, reward-tilted one through cross-entropy optimization. We identify
a key challenge in the implementation with a small training batch size and
propose several effective solutions through a novel weight baseline subtraction
technique. DMPO exhibits superior performance on multiple reasoning benchmarks
without supervised fine-tuning, with an accuracy improvement of up to $42.9\%$
over previously SOTA baselines and $55.8\%$ over the base model, underscoring
the effectiveness of the distribution matching framework. Our code is available

TL;DR: 本研究使用政治罗盘测试评估了8个主流大语言模型的政治偏见和刻板印象传播，发现所有模型都呈现一致的左倾政治倾向，且通过语言变化引发的隐性刻板印象比显性刻板印象更明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在社会信息传播和决策过程中的作用日益重要，理解其政治偏见对于防止对公众舆论和民主进程产生不当影响至关重要。

Method: 采用二维政治罗盘测试评估模型固有政治倾向，使用角色提示探索显性刻板印象，并通过多语言版本测试揭示隐性刻板印象。

Result: 所有被调查模型都显示一致的左倾政治倾向；不同模型的刻板印象性质和程度差异很大；隐性刻板印象比显性刻板印象更明显；大多数模型的隐性和显性刻板印象存在显著一致性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了大语言模型中政治偏见和刻板印象的复杂相互作用，表明模型对其固有偏见具有一定程度的透明度或"意识"。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integral to information
dissemination and decision-making processes. Given their growing societal
influence, understanding potential biases, particularly within the political
domain, is crucial to prevent undue influence on public opinion and democratic
processes. This work investigates political bias and stereotype propagation
across eight prominent LLMs using the two-dimensional Political Compass Test
(PCT). Initially, the PCT is employed to assess the inherent political leanings
of these models. Subsequently, persona prompting with the PCT is used to
explore explicit stereotypes across various social dimensions. In a final step,
implicit stereotypes are uncovered by evaluating models with multilingual
versions of the PCT. Key findings reveal a consistent left-leaning political
alignment across all investigated models. Furthermore, while the nature and
extent of stereotypes vary considerably between models, implicit stereotypes
elicited through language variation are more pronounced than those identified
via explicit persona prompting. Interestingly, for most models, implicit and
explicit stereotypes show a notable alignment, suggesting a degree of
transparency or "awareness" regarding their inherent biases. This study
underscores the complex interplay of political bias and stereotypes in LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Mix-和MoE-DPO框架，通过软混合模型和专家混合架构扩展DPO，使用随机变分推理方法，解决了标准DPO在异构偏好分布和多任务设置中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DPO方法依赖单一模型，限制了在多任务设置中的表达能力以及对异构或多样化偏好分布的适应性。

Method: 引入基于专家分配的潜变量模型，优化变分证据下界，使用软混合模型和专家混合架构，支持共享基础架构和独立专家模型。

Result: 在多种模型大小和多偏好数据集上验证了方法的有效性，展示了比标准DPO更好的性能。

Conclusion: Mix-和MoE-DPO为基于偏好的LLM对齐提供了强大且可扩展的方法，实现了泛化、专业化和上下文对齐。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently emerged as a simple and
effective alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for
aligning large language models (LLMs) with user preferences. However, existing
DPO formulations rely on a single monolithic model, which limits their
expressivity in multi-task settings and their adaptability to heterogeneous or
diverse preference distributions. In this work, we propose Mix- and MoE-DPO, a
framework that extends DPO with both soft mixture models and mixture-of-experts
(MoE) architectures, using a stochastic variational inference approach. Our
method introduces a latent-variable model over expert assignments and optimizes
a variational evidence lower bound (ELBO), enabling stable and efficient
learning of specialized expert policies from preference data. Mix- and MoE-DPO
provides three key advantages over standard DPO: (i) generalization via
universal function approximation through mixtures; (ii) reward and policy
specialization through expert components tailored to distinct preference modes;
and (iii) contextual alignment through input-dependent soft gating that enables
user-specific mixture policies. Our framework supports both shared base
architectures with expert-specific policy heads and fully independent expert
models, allowing flexible trade-offs between parameter efficiency and
specialization. We validate our approach on a variety of model sizes and
multi-preference datasets, demonstrating that Mix- and MoE-DPO offers a
powerful and scalable method for preference-based LLM alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反事实推理方法缺乏识别性，削弱了因果估计的有效性。需要建立理论框架确保反事实能从观测数据分布中恢复。

Method: 利用连续时间流方法，包括非马尔可夫设置，通过动态最优传输工具构建唯一、单调且保秩的反事实传输映射。

Result: 在具有反事实真实值的受控场景中验证理论，并在真实图像上展示了公理化反事实合理性的改进。

Conclusion: 建立了多元反事实识别的理论基础，确保反事实推理的因果有效性，为高维观测数据的因果推断提供了可靠方法。

Abstract: We address the open question of counterfactual identification for
high-dimensional multivariate outcomes from observational data. Pearl (2000)
argues that counterfactuals must be identifiable (i.e., recoverable from the
observed data distribution) to justify causal claims. A recent line of work on
counterfactual inference shows promising results but lacks identification,
undermining the causal validity of its estimates. To address this, we establish
a foundation for multivariate counterfactual identification using
continuous-time flows, including non-Markovian settings under standard
criteria. We characterise the conditions under which flow matching yields a
unique, monotone and rank-preserving counterfactual transport map with tools
from dynamic optimal transport, ensuring consistent inference. Building on
this, we validate the theory in controlled scenarios with counterfactual
ground-truth and demonstrate improvements in axiomatic counterfactual soundness
on real images.

TL;DR: 提出了一个分层框架，将物理定律的层次结构直接嵌入深度生成模型，通过傅里叶神经算子和条件流匹配实现物理约束的时间序列生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间序列生成方法往往忽略领域特定的物理约束，限制了统计和物理一致性。

Method: 结合傅里叶神经算子学习物理算子，条件流匹配进行概率生成，通过时间依赖的分层约束和FNO引导的修正进行集成。

Result: 在谐振子、人类活动识别和锂离子电池退化实验中，生成质量提高16.3%，物理违规减少46%，预测精度提升18.5%。

Conclusion: 该框架为物理信息归纳偏置提供了新范式，显著提升了生成质量和物理一致性。

Abstract: Conventional time-series generation often ignores domain-specific physical
constraints, limiting statistical and physical consistency. We propose a
hierarchical framework that embeds the inherent hierarchy of physical
laws-conservation, dynamics, boundary, and empirical relations-directly into
deep generative models, introducing a new paradigm of physics-informed
inductive bias. Our method combines Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) for
learning physical operators with Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) for
probabilistic generation, integrated via time-dependent hierarchical
constraints and FNO-guided corrections. Experiments on harmonic oscillators,
human activity recognition, and lithium-ion battery degradation show 16.3%
higher generation quality, 46% fewer physics violations, and 18.5% improved
predictive accuracy over baselines.

TL;DR: 本文提出使用自适应随机森林(ARFs)和漂移感知特征重要性(DAFI)来构建适应6G网络动态环境的AI框架，能够处理特征变化并提高预测稳定性，同时通过高效的XAI方法减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI成为6G网络控制的核心组件，AI模型需要适应不断变化的环境条件，包括多供应商部署、硬件升级和服务需求演进带来的新特征和测量指标，这需要灵活的在线学习方法。

Method: 采用自适应随机森林(ARFs)进行动态特征适应，通过迭代训练实现稳定预测；提出漂移感知特征重要性(DAFI)方法，使用分布漂移检测器来决定何时应用计算密集的特征重要性方法。

Result: 测试表明，ARFs的准确性随时间推移而提高；DAFI方法在3个不同数据集上将运行时间减少了2倍，同时产生更一致的特征重要性值。

Conclusion: ARFs和DAFI共同提供了一个有前景的框架，用于构建适应6G网络用例的灵活AI方法，能够有效处理动态环境中的特征变化和计算效率问题。

Abstract: As AI becomes a native component of 6G network control, AI models must adapt
to continuously changing conditions, including the introduction of new features
and measurements driven by multi-vendor deployments, hardware upgrades, and
evolving service requirements. To address this growing need for flexible
learning in non-stationary environments, this vision paper highlights Adaptive
Random Forests (ARFs) as a reliable solution for dynamic feature adaptation in
communication network scenarios. We show that iterative training of ARFs can
effectively lead to stable predictions, with accuracy improving over time as
more features are added. In addition, we highlight the importance of
explainability in AI-driven networks, proposing Drift-Aware Feature Importance
(DAFI) as an efficient XAI feature importance (FI) method. DAFI uses a
distributional drift detector to signal when to apply computationally intensive
FI methods instead of lighter alternatives. Our tests on 3 different datasets
indicate that our approach reduces runtime by up to 2 times, while producing
more consistent feature importance values. Together, ARFs and DAFI provide a
promising framework to build flexible AI methods adapted to 6G network
use-cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分布式机器学习中的对抗行为问题，现有方法要么依赖中央服务器，要么通信成本过高。

Method: 采用基于拉取的流行病通信策略，从小型随机节点子集拉取模型参数，无需中央服务器。

Result: 在对抗性环境下保持鲁棒性，通信效率与全连接通信相当，且在大规模网络中可扩展。

Conclusion: RPEL提供了一种可扩展的分布式鲁棒学习方法，显著降低通信成本同时保证收敛性能。

Abstract: Collaborative machine learning is challenged by training-time adversarial
behaviors. Existing approaches to tolerate such behaviors either rely on a
central server or induce high communication costs. We propose Robust Pull-based
Epidemic Learning (RPEL), a novel, scalable collaborative approach to ensure
robust learning despite adversaries. RPEL does not rely on any central server
and, unlike traditional methods, where communication costs grow in
$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ with the number of nodes $n$, RPEL employs a pull-based
epidemic-based communication strategy that scales in $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$.
By pulling model parameters from small random subsets of nodes, RPEL
significantly lowers the number of required messages without compromising
convergence guarantees, which hold with high probability. Empirical results
demonstrate that RPEL maintains robustness in adversarial settings, competes
with all-to-all communication accuracy, and scales efficiently across large
networks.

TL;DR: 该论文研究Transformer在集合补集任务中的长度泛化能力，证明了单层注意力Transformer的维度边界，并发现如果模型在短序列上实现平衡logit位移，就能泛化到更长序列但精度下降。研究还发现dropout和EMA能分别缓解softmax压缩和训练噪声问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Transformer在集合补集任务中的长度泛化能力，这种能力对于棋盘游戏式推理至关重要，因为模型需要预测输入序列中缺失的token的均匀分布。

Method: 通过理论分析建立单层注意力Transformer的维度边界，证明平衡logit位移与长度泛化的关系。通过随机超参数搜索验证dropout和EMA的作用，并在OthelloGPT上进行测试。

Result: 证明了如果模型在长度1和2上实现平衡logit位移，就能泛化到更长序列但精度降低。验证了dropout能缓解softmax压缩效应，EMA能减少训练噪声，两者都能改善长度泛化。

Conclusion: Transformer的长度泛化受到softmax压缩和训练噪声的限制，但dropout和EMA能有效缓解这些问题，在集合补集任务和更复杂的Othello任务中都验证了这一发现。

Abstract: We study length generalization in transformers through the set complement
task, where a model must predict a uniform distribution over tokens absent from
an input sequence -- an ability central to board-game style reasoning. Our main
theoretical result establishes two statements. First, we prove tight bounds on
embedding and value dimensions for single-layer attention-only transformers.
Second, we show that if such a model achieves balanced logit displacement at
lengths 1 and 2, then it must generalize to longer sequences, though with
reduced precision. A mechanistic reading of the proof explains this limitation:
as more tokens are attended to, softmax compresses logit displacements, eroding
separation between valid and invalid outputs. Training dynamics also suggest a
second obstacle: when many next tokens are possible, updates become noisy. We
hypothesize that dropout can counteract the first effect and Exponential Moving
Average (EMA) the second. We validate these hypotheses through random
hyperparameter search on the set complement task, which confirms both
mechanisms. We then test OthelloGPT, a GPT-1 style model trained on random
Othello moves, and find that EMA again improves length generalization in this
more complex setting.

TL;DR: DeepEN是一个基于深度强化学习的肠内营养个性化推荐框架，针对ICU危重患者提供每4小时的热量、蛋白质和液体摄入建议，相比临床指南方法可降低3.7个百分点的估计死亡率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统肠内营养治疗主要依赖指南或启发式方法，缺乏对患者个体生理状态演变的动态适应，需要开发能够安全个性化调整营养方案的数据驱动方法。

Method: 使用来自MIMIC-IV数据库的11,000多名ICU患者数据进行离线训练，结合临床信息的状态空间和定制奖励函数，采用带保守Q学习正则化的双决斗深度Q网络。

Result: DeepEN在各项定性和定量指标上均优于临床医生和指南策略，估计死亡率从22.5%降至18.8%，关键营养生物标志物也有改善。

Conclusion: 研究表明，安全的数据驱动肠内营养个性化治疗有潜力超越传统方法，改善患者预后。

Abstract: We introduce DeepEN, a deep reinforcement learning (RL) framework for
personalized enteral nutrition (EN) in critically ill patients. Trained offline
on over 11,000 ICU patients from the MIMIC-IV database, DeepEN generates
4-hourly recommendations for caloric, protein, and fluid intake tailored to
each patient's evolving physiology. The model integrates a curated, clinically
informed state space with a custom reward function that balances short-term
physiological and nutrition-related goals with long-term survival outcomes.
Using a dueling double deep Q-network with conservative Q-learning
regularization, DeepEN learns clinically realistic policies that align with
high-value clinician actions while discouraging unsafe deviations. Across
various qualitative and quantitative metrics, DeepEN outperforms
clinician-derived and guideline-based policies, achieving a 3.7 $\pm$ 0.17
percentage-point reduction in estimated mortality (18.8% vs 22.5%) and
improvements in key nutritional biomarkers. These findings highlight the
potential of safe, data-driven personalization of EN therapy to improve
outcomes beyond traditional guideline- or heuristic-based approaches.

Abstract: The performance of pre-trained masked diffusion models is often constrained
by their sampling procedure, which makes decisions irreversible and struggles
in low-step generation regimes. We introduce a novel sampling algorithm that
works with pre-trained models and, after a lightweight fine-tuning of a single
layer, significantly improves sample quality and efficiency. Our method
reformulates the generation process using a star-shaped paradigm, which
inherently allows for error correction. To make this process effective, we
augment it with a learnable re-masking scheduler that intelligently identifies
and revises likely errors. This approach yields a substantial quality boost,
particularly when using a small number of sampling steps. We extensively ablate
key components of our approach and show its usability in different scenarios.
In comprehensive experiments on text, and code generation, our sampling
algorithm outperforms or matches existing methods.

Abstract: While contrastive learning (CL) shows considerable promise in self-supervised
representation learning, its deployment on resource-constrained devices remains
largely underexplored. The substantial computational demands required for
training conventional CL frameworks pose a set of challenges, particularly in
terms of energy consumption, data availability, and memory usage. We conduct an
evaluation of four widely used CL frameworks: SimCLR, MoCo, SimSiam, and Barlow
Twins. We focus on the practical feasibility of these CL frameworks for edge
and fog deployment, and introduce a systematic benchmarking strategy that
includes energy profiling and reduced training data conditions. Our findings
reveal that SimCLR, contrary to its perceived computational cost, demonstrates
the lowest energy consumption across various data regimes. Finally, we also
extend our analysis by evaluating lightweight neural architectures when paired
with CL frameworks. Our study aims to provide insights into the resource
implications of deploying CL in edge/fog environments with limited processing
capabilities and opens several research directions for its future optimization.

Motivation: 传统LoRA方法存在参数干扰问题，导致性能不佳。MoE-based LoRA变体虽然能缓解单任务内的相关性，但在多任务模型合并中仍存在任务间干扰，且引入额外路由器参数。

Method: 提出FlyLoRA：1）在up-projection矩阵中引入秩方向专家激活；2）使用隐式路由器统一专家路由和下投影，用冻结的稀疏随机投影矩阵替代传统密集可训练版本。

Result: 在通用知识理解、科学问答、数学推理和代码生成四个领域的广泛实验表明，FlyLoRA相比现有方法实现了持续的性能提升。

Conclusion: FlyLoRA不仅提供了实证性能增益，还展示了生物结构如何启发AI技术创新。该方法消除了显式路由器的需求，同时利用随机矩阵的正交性固有地缓解任务间干扰。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used parameter-efficient fine-tuning
method for foundation models, but it suffers from parameter interference,
resulting in suboptimal performance. Although Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based
LoRA variants show promise in mitigating intra-task correlations in single-task
instruction tuning, they introduce additional router parameters and remain
ineffective in multi-task model merging where inter-task interference arises.
Inspired by the fly olfactory circuit, we propose FlyLoRA, an implicit
MoE-based LoRA variant that introduces: (1) rank-wise expert activation in the
up-projection matrix, and (2) an implicit router that unifies expert routing
and down-projection, where a frozen sparse random projection matrix replaces
the traditional dense trainable version. This design resolves the trade-off
between intra-task decorrelation and computational efficiency by eliminating
the need for an explicit router, while inherently mitigating inter-task
interference due to the orthogonality property of random matrices. Extensive
experiments across four domains -- general knowledge understanding, scientific
question answering, mathematical reasoning, and code generation -- demonstrate
consistent performance improvements over existing methods. Beyond empirical
gains, FlyLoRA highlights how biological structures can inspire innovations in
AI technologies. Code is available at https://github.com/gfyddha/FlyLoRA.

Result: 传统图像质量评估指标结果不一致且与视觉感知矛盾，而基于孔隙网络结构和3D连通性的生物学驱动评估能更好地解释模型性能差异。

Conclusion: 标准图像质量评估指标不适用于牙齿孔隙网络的特异性结构评估，基于生物学结构的分析方法能更有效地评估超分辨率模型的性能。

Abstract: The mechanosensory system of teeth is currently believed to partly rely on
Odontoblast cells stimulation by fluid flow through a porosity network
extending through dentin. Visualizing the smallest sub-microscopic porosity
vessels therefore requires the highest achievable resolution from confocal
fluorescence microscopy, the current gold standard. This considerably limits
the extent of the field of view to very small sample regions. To overcome this
limitation, we tested different deep learning (DL) super-resolution (SR) models
to allow faster experimental acquisitions of lower resolution images and
restore optimal image quality by post-processing. Three supervised 2D SR models
(RCAN, pix2pix, FSRCNN) and one unsupervised (CycleGAN) were applied to a
unique set of experimentally paired high- and low-resolution confocal images
acquired with different sampling schemes, resulting in a pixel size increase of
x2, x4, x8. Model performance was quantified using a broad set of similarity
and distribution-based image quality assessment (IQA) metrics, which yielded
inconsistent results that mostly contradicted our visual perception. This
raises the question of the relevance of such generic metrics to efficiently
target the specific structure of dental porosity. To resolve this conflicting
information, the generated SR images were segmented taking into account the
specific scales and morphology of the porosity network and analysed by
comparing connected components. Additionally, the capacity of the SR models to
preserve 3D porosity connectivity throughout the confocal image stacks was
evaluated using graph analysis. This biology-driven assessment allowed a far
better mechanistic interpretation of SR performance, highlighting differences
in model sensitivity to weak intensity features and the impact of non-linearity
in image generation, which explains the failure of standard IQA metrics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过引入基于困惑度的正则化方法，为数据稀缺情况下的提示优化提供了非平凡的理论泛化边界，并实证验证了该方法在改善提示泛化性能方面的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于PAC-Bayes理论的提示工程泛化边界在数据稀缺场景下往往无效，需要更精确地考虑数据或分布相关的困惑度作为有效先验，以更好地解释提示工程在实践中的广泛成功。

Method: 推导了基于困惑度正则化的新型泛化边界，通过限制搜索空间来收紧边界，并在实证中探索了边界有效性和困惑度正则化对提示泛化的实际益处。

Result: 提出的泛化边界在数据稀缺情况下仍然非平凡，困惑度正则化能够有效改善提示的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 困惑度作为有效先验能够引导优化过程，通过限制探索空间来收紧泛化边界，从而为数据稀缺场景下的提示优化提供理论支持和实践指导。

Abstract: Many prompt engineering techniques have been successful in practice, even
when optimizing over a large prompt space with with a small amount of
task-specific data. Recent work has partially explained this success by showing
generalization bounds which apply PAC-Bayes theory to the discrete prompt
space, but they are non-vacuous only in data-rich scenarios. We argue that such
widespread success can be more fully explained through more carefully
considering data- or distribution-dependent perplexity, which acts as an
effective prior and steers the optimization towards prompts that are more
``natural'' for the task at hand. We derive novel generalization bounds that
are non-vacuous for data-scarce prompt optimization via more useful priors,
formally analyzing how perplexity regularization tightens these bounds by
limiting exploration. Empirically, we explore both the bounds' effectiveness
and the practical benefits of perplexity regularization in improving prompt
generalization.

TL;DR: 提出DGPO算法，直接利用组级偏好信息进行强化学习，无需依赖低效的随机策略，显著提升扩散模型训练效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GRPO方法在扩散模型中需要随机策略，但最高效的扩散采样器基于确定性ODE，导致效率与性能冲突

Method: DGPO直接学习组级偏好，利用组内样本的相对信息，无需策略梯度框架，支持高效确定性ODE采样器

Result: 训练速度比现有最优方法快约20倍，在领域内和领域外奖励指标上均表现更优

Conclusion: DGPO通过直接学习组级偏好，解决了扩散模型中强化学习效率与性能的冲突，实现了快速高效的训练

Abstract: While reinforcement learning methods such as Group Relative Preference
Optimization (GRPO) have significantly enhanced Large Language Models, adapting
them to diffusion models remains challenging. In particular, GRPO demands a
stochastic policy, yet the most cost-effective diffusion samplers are based on
deterministic ODEs. Recent work addresses this issue by using inefficient
SDE-based samplers to induce stochasticity, but this reliance on model-agnostic
Gaussian noise leads to slow convergence. To resolve this conflict, we propose
Direct Group Preference Optimization (DGPO), a new online RL algorithm that
dispenses with the policy-gradient framework entirely. DGPO learns directly
from group-level preferences, which utilize relative information of samples
within groups. This design eliminates the need for inefficient stochastic
policies, unlocking the use of efficient deterministic ODE samplers and faster
training. Extensive results show that DGPO trains around 20 times faster than
existing state-of-the-art methods and achieves superior performance on both
in-domain and out-of-domain reward metrics. Code is available at

TL;DR: ClauseLens是一个基于条款的强化学习框架，通过将法定和政策条款嵌入到决策过程中，生成透明、合规且风险感知的再保险条约报价。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前再保险条约定价实践不透明且难以审计，需要满足严格的监管标准。

Method: 将报价任务建模为风险感知约束马尔可夫决策过程(RA-CMDP)，从法律和承保语料库中检索条款，嵌入到智能体观察中，用于约束可行动作并生成基于条款的自然语言解释。

Result: 在多代理条约模拟器中评估，ClauseLens将偿付能力违规减少51%，尾部风险表现提高27.9%(CVaR_0.10)，基于条款的解释准确率达到88.2%，检索精度87.4%，召回率91.1%。

Conclusion: 将法律背景嵌入决策和解释路径可以产生可解释、可审计且符合监管要求的报价行为，与Solvency II、NAIC RBC和欧盟AI法案保持一致。

Abstract: Reinsurance treaty pricing must satisfy stringent regulatory standards, yet
current quoting practices remain opaque and difficult to audit. We introduce
ClauseLens, a clause-grounded reinforcement learning framework that produces
transparent, regulation-compliant, and risk-aware treaty quotes.
  ClauseLens models the quoting task as a Risk-Aware Constrained Markov
Decision Process (RA-CMDP). Statutory and policy clauses are retrieved from
legal and underwriting corpora, embedded into the agent's observations, and
used both to constrain feasible actions and to generate clause-grounded natural
language justifications.
  Evaluated in a multi-agent treaty simulator calibrated to industry data,
ClauseLens reduces solvency violations by 51%, improves tail-risk performance
by 27.9% (CVaR_0.10), and achieves 88.2% accuracy in clause-grounded
explanations with retrieval precision of 87.4% and recall of 91.1%.
  These findings demonstrate that embedding legal context into both decision
and explanation pathways yields interpretable, auditable, and
regulation-aligned quoting behavior consistent with Solvency II, NAIC RBC, and
the EU AI Act.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代LLM部署面临成本与性能的权衡：优质模型性能强但昂贵，轻量级模型经济但处理复杂任务能力弱。静态路由规则和关键词启发式方法无法充分利用这一频谱且难以跨任务类型适应。

Method: 采用基于工具调用的路由系统，通过强化学习端到端训练路由器，使用显式的成本感知奖励函数来编码成本-性能权衡，无需手工设计路由规则。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，xRouter实现了强大的成本-性能权衡（例如在保持相似任务完成率的同时大幅降低成本），并为学习路由提供了实证见解。

Conclusion: xRouter为推进学习型、成本感知的LLM编排提供了实用基础，开源实现将促进该领域发展。

Abstract: Modern LLM deployments confront a widening cost-performance spectrum: premium
models deliver strong reasoning but are expensive, while lightweight models are
economical yet brittle on complex tasks. Static escalation rules and keyword
heuristics under-utilize this spectrum and fail to adapt across task types. We
present xRouter, a tool-calling-based routing system in which a learned router
can either answer directly or invoke one or more external models. The router is
trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning using an explicit, cost-aware
reward that encodes cost-performance trade-offs, eliminating the need for
hand-engineered routing rules. Our implementation encompasses the full
reinforcement learning framework, including reward and cost accounting, as well
as the deployment and evaluation pipelines. Across diverse benchmarks, xRouter
achieves strong cost-performance trade-offs (e.g., substantial cost reductions
at comparable task completion rates), and provides empirical insights into what
reliably helps learned routing and what does not, ranging from model
trainability to the difficulty of eliciting sophisticated orchestration
behaviors in small open models. We hope these findings and our open
implementation will serve as a practical substrate for advancing learned,
cost-aware LLM orchestration.

Abstract: Foundation models for time series analysis (TSA) have attracted significant
attention. However, challenges such as training data scarcity and imbalance
continue to hinder their development. Inspired by complex dynamic system
theories, we design a series-symbol data generation mechanism, enabling the
unrestricted creation of high-quality time series data paired with
corresponding symbolic expressions. To leverage series-symbol data pairs with
strong correlations, we develop \texttt{SymTime}, a pre-trained foundation
model for enhancing time series representation using symbolic information.
\texttt{SymTime} demonstrates competitive performance across five major TSA
tasks when fine-tunes with downstream tasks, rivaling foundation models
pre-trained on real-world datasets. This approach underscores the potential of
series-symbol data generation and pretraining mechanisms in overcoming data
scarcity and enhancing task performance. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN通过消息传递机制在节点间传输信息，但存在过度压缩问题，即大感受野的节点表示被压缩到固定大小的向量中，造成信息瓶颈。

Method: 重新定义节点表示的存储和检索容量，开发基于关联记忆、快速权重编程器和xLSTM的新型GNN架构。

Result: 新架构在容量合成任务和真实世界图基准测试中表现出色。

Conclusion: 从存储和检索容量角度理解过度压缩问题，并开发了有效提升GNN容量的新架构。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) leverage the graph structure to transmit
information between nodes, typically through the message-passing mechanism.
While these models have found a wide variety of applications, they are known to
suffer from over-squashing, where information from a large receptive field of
node representations is collapsed into a single fixed sized vector, resulting
in an information bottleneck. In this paper, we re-examine the over-squashing
phenomenon through the lens of model storage and retrieval capacity, which we
define as the amount of information that can be stored in a node's
representation for later use. We study some of the limitations of existing
tasks used to measure over-squashing and introduce a new synthetic task to
demonstrate that an information bottleneck can saturate this capacity.
Furthermore, we adapt ideas from the sequence modeling literature on
associative memories, fast weight programmers, and the xLSTM model to develop a
novel GNN architecture with improved capacity. We demonstrate strong
performance of this architecture both on our capacity synthetic task, as well
as a range of real-world graph benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出一个九维积分签名框架来严格分类激活函数，结合高斯传播统计、渐近斜率和正则性度量，建立了良定性、仿射重参数化定律和有界斜率变异的闭包。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有激活函数比较大多基于启发式方法，缺乏严格的分类框架来指导激活函数的选择和设计。

Method: 通过九维积分签名S_sigma(phi)对激活函数进行分类，包括高斯传播统计(m1,g1,g2,m2,eta)、渐近斜率(alpha_plus,alpha_minus)和正则性度量(TV(phi'),C(phi))。

Result: 对八种标准激活函数(ReLU、leaky-ReLU、tanh、sigmoid、Swish、GELU、Mish、TeLU)进行了分类，证明了饱和、线性增长和平滑族之间的明显区别。

Conclusion: 该框架为激活函数选择提供了原则性设计指导，将激活函数选择从试错方法转向可证明的稳定性和核条件化。

Abstract: Activation functions govern the expressivity and stability of neural
networks, yet existing comparisons remain largely heuristic. We propose a
rigorous framework for their classification via a nine-dimensional integral
signature S_sigma(phi), combining Gaussian propagation statistics (m1, g1, g2,
m2, eta), asymptotic slopes (alpha_plus, alpha_minus), and regularity measures
(TV(phi'), C(phi)). This taxonomy establishes well-posedness, affine
reparameterization laws with bias, and closure under bounded slope variation.
Dynamical analysis yields Lyapunov theorems with explicit descent constants and
identifies variance stability regions through (m2', g2). From a kernel
perspective, we derive dimension-free Hessian bounds and connect smoothness to
bounded variation of phi'. Applying the framework, we classify eight standard
activations (ReLU, leaky-ReLU, tanh, sigmoid, Swish, GELU, Mish, TeLU), proving
sharp distinctions between saturating, linear-growth, and smooth families.
Numerical Gauss-Hermite and Monte Carlo validation confirms theoretical
predictions. Our framework provides principled design guidance, moving
activation choice from trial-and-error to provable stability and kernel
conditioning.

Motivation: 传统视频摘要方法忽略了任务固有的主观性，仅回归到多个评分者的平均帧分数，无法反映不同人类视角的多样性。

Method: 采用扩散模型，将视频摘要作为条件生成任务，使模型能够学习良好摘要的分布，并根据输入视频生成多个候选摘要。

Result: SummDiff在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，生成的摘要更符合个体标注者偏好，并通过新颖的背包问题分析指标提供更深入见解。

Conclusion: 将视频摘要重新定义为条件生成任务，结合扩散模型，能够更好地处理任务的主观性，生成多样且符合人类偏好的摘要。

Abstract: Video summarization is a task of shortening a video by choosing a subset of
frames while preserving its essential moments. Despite the innate subjectivity
of the task, previous works have deterministically regressed to an averaged
frame score over multiple raters, ignoring the inherent subjectivity of what
constitutes a good summary. We propose a novel problem formulation by framing
video summarization as a conditional generation task, allowing a model to learn
the distribution of good summaries and to generate multiple plausible summaries
that better reflect varying human perspectives. Adopting diffusion models for
the first time in video summarization, our proposed method, SummDiff,
dynamically adapts to visual contexts and generates multiple candidate
summaries conditioned on the input video. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SummDiff not only achieves the state-of-the-art performance on various
benchmarks but also produces summaries that closely align with individual
annotator preferences. Moreover, we provide a deeper insight with novel metrics
from an analysis of the knapsack, which is an important last step of generating
summaries but has been overlooked in evaluation.

Motivation: 传统聚类算法受限于预定义的相似性度量，无法灵活捕捉输入之间的复杂关系，而LLM的注意力机制和上下文学习能力为聚类提供了新的可能性。

Method: 使用预训练LLM的注意力矩阵进行谱聚类，并通过Next Token Prediction (NTP)损失对数值和图像数据进行微调，还支持文本条件图像聚类。

Conclusion: 该工作将上下文学习扩展到无监督设置，展示了LLM在聚类任务中的有效性和灵活性，为传统聚类方法提供了新的替代方案。

Abstract: We propose In-Context Clustering (ICC), a flexible LLM-based procedure for
clustering data from diverse distributions. Unlike traditional clustering
algorithms constrained by predefined similarity measures, ICC flexibly captures
complex relationships among inputs through an attention mechanism. We show that
pretrained LLMs exhibit impressive zero-shot clustering capabilities on
text-encoded numeric data, with attention matrices showing salient cluster
patterns. Spectral clustering using attention matrices offers surprisingly
competitive performance. We further enhance the clustering capabilities of LLMs
on numeric and image data through fine-tuning using the Next Token Prediction
(NTP) loss. Moreover, the flexibility of LLM prompting enables text-conditioned
image clustering, a capability that classical clustering methods lack. Our work
extends in-context learning to an unsupervised setting, showcasing the
effectiveness and flexibility of LLMs for clustering. Our code is available at

Motivation: 传统多模态学习依赖配对数据集，但能否利用未配对的辅助多模态数据直接增强目标模态的表征学习是一个被忽视但具有潜力的问题。

Method: 提出UML：未配对多模态学习器，采用模态无关的训练范式，单个模型交替处理不同模态的输入，同时在模态间共享参数。

Result: 理论上在线性数据生成假设下，未配对辅助数据可以产生比单模态训练更信息丰富的表征；实证表明使用文本、音频或图像等未配对辅助模态数据能持续提升下游单模态任务的性能。

Conclusion: UML证明了即使没有显式配对，通过共享参数和交替处理不同模态，未配对的多模态数据也能有效增强单模态表征学习。

Abstract: Traditional multimodal learners find unified representations for tasks like
visual question answering, but rely heavily on paired datasets. However, an
overlooked yet potentially powerful question is: can one leverage auxiliary
unpaired multimodal data to directly enhance representation learning in a
target modality? We introduce UML: Unpaired Multimodal Learner, a
modality-agnostic training paradigm in which a single model alternately
processes inputs from different modalities while sharing parameters across
them. This design exploits the assumption that different modalities are
projections of a shared underlying reality, allowing the model to benefit from
cross-modal structure without requiring explicit pairs. Theoretically, under
linear data-generating assumptions, we show that unpaired auxiliary data can
yield representations strictly more informative about the data-generating
process than unimodal training. Empirically, we show that using unpaired data
from auxiliary modalities -- such as text, audio, or images -- consistently
improves downstream performance across diverse unimodal targets such as image
and audio. Our project page: https://unpaired-multimodal.github.io/

Abstract: Existing batch size selection approaches in distributed machine learning rely
on static allocation or simplistic heuristics that fail to adapt to
heterogeneous, dynamic computing environments. We present DYNAMIX, a
reinforcement learning framework that formulates batch size optimization as a
sequential decision-making problem using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).
Our approach employs a multi-dimensional state representation encompassing
network-level metrics, system-level resource utilization, and training
statistical efficiency indicators to enable informed decision-making across
diverse computational resources. Our approach eliminates the need for explicit
system modeling while integrating seamlessly with existing distributed training
frameworks. Through evaluations across diverse workloads, hardware
configurations, and network conditions, DYNAMIX achieves up to 6.3% improvement
in the final model accuracy and 46% reduction in the total training time. Our
scalability experiments demonstrate that DYNAMIX maintains the best performance
as cluster size increases to 32 nodes, while policy transfer experiments show
that learned policies generalize effectively across related model
architectures.

Abstract: In the pursuit of finding an optimal policy, reinforcement learning (RL)
methods generally ignore the properties of learned policies apart from their
expected return. Thus, even when successful, it is difficult to characterize
which policies will be learned and what they will do. In this work, we present
a theoretical framework for policy optimization that guarantees convergence to
a particular optimal policy, via vanishing entropy regularization and a
temperature decoupling gambit. Our approach realizes an interpretable,
diversity-preserving optimal policy as the regularization temperature vanishes
and ensures the convergence of policy derived objects--value functions and
return distributions. In a particular instance of our method, for example, the
realized policy samples all optimal actions uniformly. Leveraging our
temperature decoupling gambit, we present an algorithm that estimates, to
arbitrary accuracy, the return distribution associated to its interpretable,
diversity-preserving optimal policy.

Motivation: 尽管RLVR在实践中取得了显著成功，但其工作原理缺乏理论理解。本文旨在建立RLVR的理论基础，解释其为何有效以及如何优化训练过程。

Method: 通过分析RLVR在完整响应和token级别的训练过程，引入梯度间隙概念来形式化从低奖励到高奖励区域的改进方向，并推导收敛条件和步长阈值。

Result: 证明了收敛依赖于更新方向与梯度间隙的对齐，推导了基于梯度间隙大小的步长阈值，预测了临界步长如何随响应长度和成功率缩放，并通过实验验证了理论预测。

Conclusion: RLVR的成功依赖于梯度间隙的对齐，存在临界步长阈值，解释了长度归一化等启发式方法的作用，并为优化RLVR训练提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), which uses simple
binary feedback to post-train large language models, has shown significant
empirical success. However, a principled understanding of why it works has been
lacking. This paper builds a theoretical foundation for RLVR by analyzing its
training process at both the full-response (trajectory) and token levels.
Central to our analysis is a quantity called the Gradient Gap, which formalizes
the direction of improvement from low-reward to high-reward regions of the
response space. We prove that convergence critically depends on aligning the
update direction with this Gradient Gap. Moreover, we derive a sharp step-size
threshold based on the magnitude of the Gradient Gap: below it, learning
converges, whereas above it, performance collapses. Our theory further predicts
how the critical step size must scale with response length and the success
rate, thereby explaining why practical heuristics such as length normalization
improve stability and showing that, with a fixed learning rate, the success
rate can stagnate strictly below $100\%$. We validate these predictions through
controlled bandit simulations and LLM experiments, including training
Qwen2.5-7B with GRPO.

*Kevin Rojas,Jiahe Lin,Kashif Rasul,Anderson Schneider,Yuriy Nevmyvaka,Molei Tao,Wei Deng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了GDPO算法，通过半确定性蒙特卡洛方案降低ELBO估计器的方差，为扩散语言模型的强化学习微调提供了更有效的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型具有并行生成和迭代优化的优势，但现有的强化学习微调方法存在偏差或计算成本过高的问题。

Method: 使用半确定性蒙特卡洛方案来降低ELBO估计器的方差，提出了Group Diffusion Policy Optimization (GDPO)算法。

Result: GDPO在数学、推理和编程基准测试中优于预训练检查点和现有最佳基线方法diffu-GRPO。

Conclusion: GDPO为扩散语言模型的强化学习微调提供了一个有效且实用的解决方案，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) enable parallel, order-agnostic generation
with iterative refinement, offering a flexible alternative to autoregressive
large language models (LLMs). However, adapting reinforcement learning (RL)
fine-tuning to DLMs remains an open challenge because of the intractable
likelihood. Pioneering work such as diffu-GRPO estimated token-level
likelihoods via one-step unmasking. While computationally efficient, this
approach is severely biased. A more principled foundation lies in
sequence-level likelihoods, where the evidence lower bound (ELBO) serves as a
surrogate. Yet, despite this clean mathematical connection, ELBO-based methods
have seen limited adoption due to the prohibitive cost of likelihood
evaluation. In this work, we revisit ELBO estimation and disentangle its
sources of variance. This decomposition motivates reducing variance through
fast, deterministic integral approximations along a few pivotal dimensions.
Building on this insight, we introduce \textbf{Group Diffusion Policy
Optimization (GDPO)}, a new RL algorithm tailored for DLMs. GDPO leverages
simple yet effective Semi-deterministic Monte Carlo schemes to mitigate the
variance explosion of ELBO estimators under vanilla double Monte Carlo
sampling, yielding a provably lower-variance estimator under tight evaluation
budgets. Empirically, GDPO achieves consistent gains over pretrained
checkpoints and outperforms diffu-GRPO, one of the state-of-the-art baselines,
on the majority of math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks.

### [231] [Who Said Neural Networks Aren't Linear?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08570)
*Nimrod Berman,Assaf Hallak,Assaf Shocher*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种称为Linearizer的架构，通过在两个可逆神经网络之间夹入线性算子，使得非线性函数在特定向量空间中表现为线性，从而将线性代数工具应用于非线性映射。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络本质上是非线性的，但线性性取决于向量空间的定义。本文旨在找到一种方法，使得传统非线性函数在特定构造的向量空间中表现为线性。

Method: 提出Linearizer架构：f(x)=g_y^{-1}(A g_x(x))，其中A是线性算子，g_x和g_y是可逆神经网络。通过g_x和g_y诱导出新的向量空间结构。

Result: 该方法使得SVD、伪逆、正交投影等线性代数工具可应用于非线性映射。两个共享神经网络的Linearizer组合仍为Linearizer，可将扩散模型的数百步采样压缩为单步。

Conclusion: Linearizer框架成功将线性代数工具扩展到非线性映射，在扩散模型采样、投影生成模型和风格迁移等任务中展示了优越性能。

Abstract: Neural networks are famously nonlinear. However, linearity is defined
relative to a pair of vector spaces, $f$$:$$X$$\to$$Y$. Is it possible to
identify a pair of non-standard vector spaces for which a conventionally
nonlinear function is, in fact, linear? This paper introduces a method that
makes such vector spaces explicit by construction. We find that if we sandwich
a linear operator $A$ between two invertible neural networks, $f(x)=g_y^{-1}(A
g_x(x))$, then the corresponding vector spaces $X$ and $Y$ are induced by newly
defined addition and scaling actions derived from $g_x$ and $g_y$. We term this
kind of architecture a Linearizer. This framework makes the entire arsenal of
linear algebra, including SVD, pseudo-inverse, orthogonal projection and more,
applicable to nonlinear mappings. Furthermore, we show that the composition of
two Linearizers that share a neural network is also a Linearizer. We leverage
this property and demonstrate that training diffusion models using our
architecture makes the hundreds of sampling steps collapse into a single step.
We further utilize our framework to enforce idempotency (i.e. $f(f(x))=f(x)$)
on networks leading to a globally projective generative model and to
demonstrate modular style transfer.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FLEET是一个混合分散式框架，将自然语言指令转化为优化的多机器人调度方案，结合LLM前端生成任务图和机器人-任务适配矩阵，以及形式化后端进行最小化完成时间的优化调度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决异构机器人团队从自由形式自然语言指令进行协调的难题，语言规划器难以处理长期协调和幻觉问题，而纯形式化方法需要封闭世界模型。

Method: 使用LLM前端生成任务图（包含持续时间和优先级）和机器人-任务适配矩阵，形式化后端解决最小化完成时间问题，机器人执行具有自主闭环控制的自由形式子任务。

Result: 在多个自由形式语言引导的自主协调基准测试中，FLEET在异构任务的两智能体团队上比最先进的生成规划器提高了成功率。消融实验显示MILP主要改善时间结构，LLM衍生的适配度对能力耦合任务至关重要。

Conclusion: FLEET框架成功将自然语言指令转化为优化的多机器人调度，在真实硬件试验中验证了其有效性，使用具有不同能力的四足机器人对进行演示。

Abstract: Coordinating heterogeneous robot teams from free-form natural-language
instructions is hard. Language-only planners struggle with long-horizon
coordination and hallucination, while purely formal methods require
closed-world models. We present FLEET, a hybrid decentralized framework that
turns language into optimized multi-robot schedules. An LLM front-end produces
(i) a task graph with durations and precedence and (ii) a capability-aware
robot--task fitness matrix; a formal back-end solves a makespan-minimization
problem while the underlying robots execute their free-form subtasks with
agentic closed-loop control. Across multiple free-form language-guided autonomy
coordination benchmarks, FLEET improves success over state of the art
generative planners on two-agent teams across heterogeneous tasks. Ablations
show that mixed integer linear programming (MILP) primarily improves temporal
structure, while LLM-derived fitness is decisive for capability-coupled tasks;
together they deliver the highest overall performance. We demonstrate the
translation to real world challenges with hardware trials using a pair of
quadruped robots with disjoint capabilities.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出基于门控循环单元的轻量级编码器-解码器模型，用于在信息稀缺条件下预测高性能车辆的未来状态，最大平均相对误差低于2.6%，具有良好的噪声鲁棒性和物理一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高性能车辆的动态建模需要详细的系统结构信息，但这些信息对于非设计者通常不可得，这是自动驾驶应用中的典型问题。

Method: 使用基于门控循环单元的编码器-解码器模型，通过车辆历史状态测量值和驾驶员控制动作来关联预测未来状态。

Result: 在极端动态条件下，模型最大平均相对误差低于2.6%，对感兴趣频率成分的噪声输入具有良好的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该完全数据驱动且不受物理约束的模型在输出信号（如纵向和横向加速度、横摆角速度和纵向速度）方面表现出物理一致性。

Abstract: Developing a dynamic model for a high-performance vehicle is a complex
problem that requires extensive structural information about the system under
analysis. This information is often unavailable to those who did not design the
vehicle and represents a typical issue in autonomous driving applications,
which are frequently developed on top of existing vehicles; therefore, vehicle
models are developed under conditions of information scarcity. This paper
proposes a lightweight encoder-decoder model based on Gate Recurrent Unit
layers to correlate the vehicle's future state with its past states, measured
onboard, and control actions the driver performs. The results demonstrate that
the model achieves a maximum mean relative error below 2.6% in extreme dynamic
conditions. It also shows good robustness when subject to noisy input data
across the interested frequency components. Furthermore, being entirely
data-driven and free from physical constraints, the model exhibits physical
consistency in the output signals, such as longitudinal and lateral
accelerations, yaw rate, and the vehicle's longitudinal velocity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统解析求解器仅限于低自由度系统，而数值优化方法计算成本高且容易陷入局部最小值，需要开发更高效通用的逆运动学求解器。

Method: 使用GPU加速的采样方法，结合方向感知的贪婪坐标下降初始化方案和雅可比矩阵优化程序，形成混合求解器。

Result: 相比现有最优方法，在收敛速度和整体精度方面均有提升，在精度-延迟帕累托前沿持续找到解决方案，通常获得数量级增益，并产生高质量样本的广泛分布。

Conclusion: HJCD-IK在逆运动学求解方面实现了显著的性能提升，代码已开源供社区使用。

Abstract: Inverse Kinematics (IK) is a core problem in robotics, in which joint
configurations are found to achieve a desired end-effector pose. Although
analytical solvers are fast and efficient, they are limited to systems with low
degrees-of-freedom and specific topological structures. Numerical
optimization-based approaches are more general, but suffer from high
computational costs and frequent convergence to spurious local minima. Recent
efforts have explored the use of GPUs to combine sampling and optimization to
enhance both the accuracy and speed of IK solvers. We build on this recent
literature and introduce HJCD-IK, a GPU-accelerated, sampling-based hybrid
solver that combines an orientation-aware greedy coordinate descent
initialization scheme with a Jacobian-based polishing routine. This design
enables our solver to improve both convergence speed and overall accuracy as
compared to the state-of-the-art, consistently finding solutions along the
accuracy-latency Pareto frontier and often achieving order-of-magnitude gains.
In addition, our method produces a broad distribution of high-quality samples,
yielding the lowest maximum mean discrepancy. We release our code open-source
for the benefit of the community.

*Adam Hung,Fan Yang,Abhinav Kumar,Sergio Aguilera Marinovic,Soshi Iba,Rana Soltani Zarrin,Dmitry Berenson*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出Amortized Value Optimization (AVO)方法，通过引入学习价值函数来预测未来任务性能，解决灵巧操作中接触模式切换的轨迹优化问题，减少计算成本并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灵巧操作任务需要在不同接触模式间切换，传统方法将任务分解为独立子任务分别优化，但独立优化会限制性能且计算成本高昂。

Method: 引入学习价值函数预测总未来任务性能，将该价值函数纳入轨迹优化成本中，通过价值函数梯度引导优化器朝向最小化未来子任务成本的状态。

Result: 在螺丝刀抓取和转动任务的仿真和真实实验中，即使计算预算减少50%，相比无价值函数的轨迹优化仍表现出改进性能。

Conclusion: AVO方法有效桥接独立优化的子任务，通过减少在线计算量加速优化过程，在灵巧操作任务中实现更好性能。

Abstract: Dexterous manipulation tasks often require switching between different
contact modes, such as rolling, sliding, sticking, or non-contact contact
modes. When formulating dexterous manipulation tasks as a trajectory
optimization problem, a common approach is to decompose these tasks into
sub-tasks for each contact mode, which are each solved independently.
Optimizing each sub-task independently can limit performance, as optimizing
contact points, contact forces, or other variables without information about
future sub-tasks can place the system in a state from which it is challenging
to make progress on subsequent sub-tasks. Further, optimizing these sub-tasks
is very computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we propose
Amortized Value Optimization (AVO), which introduces a learned value function
that predicts the total future task performance. By incorporating this value
function into the cost of the trajectory optimization at each planning step,
the value function gradients guide the optimizer toward states that minimize
the cost in future sub-tasks. This effectively bridges separately optimized
sub-tasks, and accelerates the optimization by reducing the amount of online
computation needed. We validate AVO on a screwdriver grasping and turning task
in both simulation and real world experiments, and show improved performance
even with 50% less computational budget compared to trajectory optimization
without the value function.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一组基于隐式模型的检查规划原语(IPIM)，使基于采样的检查规划器能够完全使用神经SDF表示进行规划，大幅减少内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础设施老化和复杂性增加使得高效检查规划更加重要。现有基于采样的检查规划器虽然快速但内存需求大，特别是对于大型复杂结构。隐式模型(如神经SDF)能高效表示复杂结构，但现有规划原语主要针对显式模型设计。

Method: 开发了IPIM(基于隐式模型的检查规划原语)，使基于采样的检查规划器能够完全使用神经SDF表示，无需在隐式和显式模型间频繁转换。

Result: 在三个场景(包括超过9200万个三角网格面的真实复杂结构)的评估表明，即使使用基本的基于采样规划器配合IPIM，也能生成与最先进规划器质量相当的检查轨迹，同时内存使用减少高达70倍。

Conclusion: IPIM使基于采样的检查规划器能够有效利用隐式模型表示，显著降低内存需求，同时保持规划质量，为大型复杂基础设施的检查规划提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The aging and increasing complexity of infrastructures make efficient
inspection planning more critical in ensuring safety. Thanks to sampling-based
motion planning, many inspection planners are fast. However, they often require
huge memory. This is particularly true when the structure under inspection is
large and complex, consisting of many struts and pillars of various geometry
and sizes. Such structures can be represented efficiently using implicit
models, such as neural Signed Distance Functions (SDFs). However, most
primitive computations used in sampling-based inspection planner have been
designed to work efficiently with explicit environment models, which in turn
requires the planner to use explicit environment models or performs frequent
transformations between implicit and explicit environment models during
planning. This paper proposes a set of primitive computations, called
Inspection Planning Primitives with Implicit Models (IPIM), that enable
sampling-based inspection planners to entirely use neural SDFs representation
during planning. Evaluation on three scenarios, including inspection of a
complex real-world structure with over 92M triangular mesh faces, indicates
that even a rudimentary sampling-based planner with IPIM can generate
inspection trajectories of similar quality to those generated by the
state-of-the-art planner, while using up to 70x less memory than the
state-of-the-art inspection planner.

*Alexander Du,Emre Adabag,Gabriel Bravo,Brian Plancher*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GATO是一个开源的GPU加速批量轨迹优化求解器，专为中等批量规模（数十到数百个求解）的实时MPC应用设计，在算法、软件和计算硬件层面协同优化，实现了18-21倍于CPU基准和1.4-16倍于GPU基准的加速效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GPU加速方法要么并行化单个求解以满足实时截止时间，要么以慢于实时的速率扩展到非常大的批量，或者通过限制模型通用性来获得速度。这为需要实时批量求解的现代MPC应用留下了性能空白。

Method: GATO采用跨算法、软件和计算硬件的协同设计，利用块级、warp级和线程级并行性，在求解内部和求解之间实现超高性能。

Result: 模拟基准测试显示，随着批量大小增加，GATO比CPU基准快18-21倍，比GPU基准快1.4-16倍；案例研究展示了改进的扰动抑制和收敛行为；在工业机械臂上的硬件验证也证实了有效性。

Conclusion: GATO填补了中等批量规模实时MPC应用的性能空白，通过协同设计实现了显著的加速效果，并已开源以支持可重复性和采用。

Abstract: While Model Predictive Control (MPC) delivers strong performance across
robotics applications, solving the underlying (batches of) nonlinear trajectory
optimization (TO) problems online remains computationally demanding. Existing
GPU-accelerated approaches typically (i) parallelize a single solve to meet
real-time deadlines, (ii) scale to very large batches at slower-than-real-time
rates, or (iii) achieve speed by restricting model generality (e.g., point-mass
dynamics or a single linearization). This leaves a large gap in solver
performance for many state-of-the-art MPC applications that require real-time
batches of tens to low-hundreds of solves. As such, we present GATO, an open
source, GPU-accelerated, batched TO solver co-designed across algorithm,
software, and computational hardware to deliver real-time throughput for these
moderate batch size regimes. Our approach leverages a combination of block-,
warp-, and thread-level parallelism within and across solves for ultra-high
performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a
combination of: simulated benchmarks showing speedups of 18-21x over CPU
baselines and 1.4-16x over GPU baselines as batch size increases; case studies
highlighting improved disturbance rejection and convergence behavior; and
finally a validation on hardware using an industrial manipulator. We open
source GATO to support reproducibility and adoption.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SPaSM是一个完全GPU并行化的框架，通过优化的CUDA内核实现约束评估、采样和梯度优化的端到端轨迹优化，无需CPU协调，在具有挑战性的基准测试中实现了毫秒级求解时间和100%成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 顺序机器人操作任务需要在可能的高维配置空间中找到满足多个物体交互几何约束的无碰撞轨迹。由于计算需求，实时和大规模解决这些问题一直难以实现。现有的GPU加速方法由于CPU-GPU数据传输开销和复杂逻辑限制了硬件利用率。

Method: SPaSM采用两阶段粒子优化策略：首先通过大规模并行采样解决放置约束，然后将解决方案提升到关节空间的完整轨迹优化。该方法将约束评估、采样和梯度优化编译成优化的CUDA内核，实现端到端轨迹优化。

Result: 在具有挑战性的基准测试中，SPaSM实现了毫秒级的求解时间，成功率达到100%，相比现有方法实现了4000倍的加速。

Conclusion: SPaSM通过完全GPU并行化和优化的内核实现，显著提高了顺序机器人操作任务的求解效率，证明了在复杂约束下实现实时轨迹优化的可行性。

Abstract: Sequential robot manipulation tasks require finding collision-free
trajectories that satisfy geometric constraints across multiple object
interactions in potentially high-dimensional configuration spaces. Solving
these problems in real-time and at large scales has remained out of reach due
to computational requirements. Recently, GPU-based acceleration has shown
promising results, but prior methods achieve limited performance due to CPU-GPU
data transfer overhead and complex logic that prevents full hardware
utilization. To this end, we present SPaSM (Sampling Particle optimization for
Sequential Manipulation), a fully GPU-parallelized framework that compiles
constraint evaluation, sampling, and gradient-based optimization into optimized
CUDA kernels for end-to-end trajectory optimization without CPU coordination.
The method consists of a two-stage particle optimization strategy: first
solving placement constraints through massively parallel sampling, then lifting
solutions to full trajectory optimization in joint space. Unlike hierarchical
approaches, SPaSM jointly optimizes object placements and robot trajectories to
handle scenarios where motion feasibility constrains placement options.
Experimental evaluation on challenging benchmarks demonstrates solution times
in the realm of $\textbf{milliseconds}$ with a 100% success rate; a
$4000\times$ speedup compared to existing approaches.

TL;DR: 提出EB-MBD方法，通过引入渐进式障碍函数约束来解决基于模型扩散中的性能退化问题，显著提高解的质量并减少计算时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于模型的扩散方法在约束条件下会出现灾难性性能下降，即使在简单的2D系统中，由于蒙特卡洛近似得分函数的样本效率低下。

Method: 引入新兴障碍函数模型扩散(EB-MBD)，使用渐进引入的障碍约束避免性能问题，无需计算昂贵的投影操作，并分析采样活跃度来指导障碍参数调度选择。

Result: 在2D碰撞避免和3D水下机械臂系统中，该方法相比基于模型扩散获得更低成本的解，且比基于投影的方法计算时间减少数个数量级。

Conclusion: EB-MBD方法通过渐进障碍约束有效解决了基于模型扩散的约束处理问题，在保持解质量的同时大幅提升计算效率。

Abstract: We propose enforcing constraints on Model-Based Diffusion by introducing
emerging barrier functions inspired by interior point methods. We show that
constraints on Model-Based Diffusion can lead to catastrophic performance
degradation, even on simple 2D systems due to sample inefficiency in the Monte
Carlo approximation of the score function. We introduce Emerging-Barrier
Model-Based Diffusion (EB-MBD) which uses progressively introduced barrier
constraints to avoid these problems, significantly improving solution quality,
without the need for computationally expensive operations such as projections.
We analyze the sampling liveliness of samples each iteration to inform barrier
parameter scheduling choice. We demonstrate results for 2D collision avoidance
and a 3D underwater manipulator system and show that our method achieves lower
cost solutions than Model-Based Diffusion, and requires orders of magnitude
less computation time than projection based methods.

Conclusion: 该规划框架能够有效确保双足机器人在不确定粗糙地形上的安全导航，具有概率安全性和目标可达性保证。

Abstract: We address the challenge of enabling bipedal robots to traverse rough terrain
by developing probabilistically safe planning and control strategies that
ensure dynamic feasibility and centroidal robustness under terrain uncertainty.
Specifically, we propose a high-level Model Predictive Control (MPC) navigation
framework for a bipedal robot with a specified confidence level of safety that
(i) enables safe traversal toward a desired goal location across a terrain map
with uncertain elevations, and (ii) formally incorporates uncertainty bounds
into the centroidal dynamics of locomotion control. To model the rough terrain,
we employ Gaussian Process (GP) regression to estimate elevation maps and
leverage Conformal Prediction (CP) to construct calibrated confidence intervals
that capture the true terrain elevation. Building on this, we formulate
contraction-based reachable tubes that explicitly account for terrain
uncertainty, ensuring state convergence and tube invariance. In addition, we
introduce a contraction-based flywheel torque control law for the reduced-order
Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM), which stabilizes the angular momentum
about the center-of-mass (CoM). This formulation provides both probabilistic
safety and goal reachability guarantees. For a given confidence level, we
establish the forward invariance of the proposed torque control law by
demonstrating exponential stabilization of the actual CoM phase-space
trajectory and the desired trajectory prescribed by the high-level planner.
Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our planning framework through
physics-based simulations of the Digit bipedal robot in MuJoCo.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种可配置、组件无关的幻觉注入框架，用于研究自动驾驶车辆感知失败对安全性的影响，通过在开源模拟器中注入六种幻觉类型来量化其对碰撞和险情的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有故障注入研究通常针对单一传感器或感知模块，导致难以推广或集成到统一模拟环境中的孤立框架。为了解决这一局限性，需要一种能够独立于特定传感器或算法的分析方法。

Method: 将感知失败重新定义为幻觉（扭曲自动驾驶车辆态势感知的虚假感知），提出可配置的组件无关幻觉注入框架，在迭代开源模拟器中诱导六种可信幻觉类型，执行超过18,350次模拟。

Result: 统计验证了框架有效性，量化了每种幻觉类型对碰撞和险情的影响。某些幻觉（如感知延迟和漂移）显著增加了测试场景中的碰撞风险。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一个可扩展、统计验证、组件无关且完全互操作的工具集，可简化和加速自动驾驶安全验证，为容错和弹性自动驾驶设计奠定基础。

Abstract: Perception failures in autonomous vehicles (AV) remain a major safety concern
because they are the basis for many accidents. To study how these failures
affect safety, researchers typically inject artificial faults into hardware or
software components and observe the outcomes. However, existing fault injection
studies often target a single sensor or machine perception (MP) module,
resulting in siloed frameworks that are difficult to generalize or integrate
into unified simulation environments. This work addresses that limitation by
reframing perception failures as hallucinations, false perceptions that distort
an AV situational awareness and may trigger unsafe control actions. Since
hallucinations describe only observable effects, this abstraction enables
analysis independent of specific sensors or algorithms, focusing instead on how
their faults manifest along the MP pipeline. Building on this concept, we
propose a configurable, component-agnostic hallucination injection framework
that induces six plausible hallucination types in an iterative open-source
simulator. More than 18,350 simulations were executed in which hallucinations
were injected while AVs crossed an unsignalized transverse street with traffic.
The results statistically validate the framework and quantify the impact of
each hallucination type on collisions and near misses. Certain hallucinations,
such as perceptual latency and drift, significantly increase the risk of
collision in the scenario tested, validating the proposed paradigm can stress
the AV system safety. The framework offers a scalable, statistically validated,
component agnostic, and fully interoperable toolset that simplifies and
accelerates AV safety validations, even those with novel MP architectures and
components. It can potentially reduce the time-to-market of AV and lay the
foundation for future research on fault tolerance, and resilient AV design.

Abstract: Learning manipulation skills from human demonstration videos presents a
promising yet challenging problem, primarily due to the significant embodiment
gap between human body and robot manipulators. Existing methods rely on paired
datasets or hand-crafted rewards, which limit scalability and generalization.
We propose TrajSkill, a framework for Trajectory Conditioned Cross-embodiment
Skill Transfer, enabling robots to acquire manipulation skills directly from
human demonstration videos. Our key insight is to represent human motions as
sparse optical flow trajectories, which serve as embodiment-agnostic motion
cues by removing morphological variations while preserving essential dynamics.
Conditioned on these trajectories together with visual and textual inputs,
TrajSkill jointly synthesizes temporally consistent robot manipulation videos
and translates them into executable actions, thereby achieving cross-embodiment
skill transfer. Extensive experiments are conducted, and the results on
simulation data (MetaWorld) show that TrajSkill reduces FVD by 39.6\% and KVD
by 36.6\% compared with the state-of-the-art, and improves cross-embodiment
success rate by up to 16.7\%. Real-robot experiments in kitchen manipulation
tasks further validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating
practical human-to-robot skill transfer across embodiments.

TL;DR: IntentionVLA是一个视觉-语言-动作模型框架，通过课程训练和高效推理机制，解决了现有VLA模型在复杂人机交互中缺乏隐式人类意图推理能力的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的VLA模型主要在有限相关性的多模态任务上预训练，然后微调以将显式指令映射到动作，缺乏推理密集型预训练和推理引导的操作，无法执行复杂真实世界交互所需的隐式人类意图推理。

Method: 提出IntentionVLA框架，首先利用精心设计的推理数据（结合意图推断、空间定位和紧凑的具身推理）进行预训练，然后在微调阶段使用紧凑推理输出作为动作生成的上下文指导，实现间接指令下的快速推理。

Result: 实验结果显示IntentionVLA显著优于基线模型，在直接指令下成功率提高18%，在意图指令下比ECoT提高28%。在分布外意图任务上，IntentionVLA的成功率是所有基线的两倍以上，并实现了零样本人机交互40%的成功率。

Conclusion: IntentionVLA为下一代人机交互系统提供了一个有前景的范式，通过增强模型的推理能力显著提升了在复杂交互场景中的表现。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage pretrained vision-language
models (VLMs) to couple perception with robotic control, offering a promising
path toward general-purpose embodied intelligence. However, current SOTA VLAs
are primarily pretrained on multimodal tasks with limited relevance to embodied
scenarios, and then finetuned to map explicit instructions to actions.
Consequently, due to the lack of reasoning-intensive pretraining and
reasoning-guided manipulation, these models are unable to perform implicit
human intention reasoning required for complex, real-world interactions. To
overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{IntentionVLA}, a VLA framework
with a curriculum training paradigm and an efficient inference mechanism. Our
proposed method first leverages carefully designed reasoning data that combine
intention inference, spatial grounding, and compact embodied reasoning,
endowing the model with both reasoning and perception capabilities. In the
following finetuning stage, IntentionVLA employs the compact reasoning outputs
as contextual guidance for action generation, enabling fast inference under
indirect instructions. Experimental results show that IntentionVLA
substantially outperforms $\pi_0$, achieving 18\% higher success rates with
direct instructions and 28\% higher than ECoT under intention instructions. On
out-of-distribution intention tasks, IntentionVLA achieves over twice the
success rate of all baselines, and further enables zero-shot human-robot
interaction with 40\% success rate. These results highlight IntentionVLA as a
promising paradigm for next-generation human-robot interaction (HRI) systems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了GM3模型，一个基于轮胎刷表示的通用微移动车辆动力学模型，支持任意车轮配置，并通过交互式仿真框架和实证验证展示了其优于传统运动学自行车模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有微移动车辆建模工具主要依赖运动学自行车模型或其变体，忽略了轮胎滑移、载荷转移和骑手/车辆倾斜等重要物理效应，缺乏统一的物理基础模型来捕捉各种常见微移动车辆和车轮布局的动力学特性。

Method: 提出GM3模型，基于轮胎刷表示构建轮胎级公式，支持单/双轨和多轮平台等任意车轮配置；开发交互式模型无关仿真框架，使用固定步长RK4积分、人在环和脚本控制、实时轨迹跟踪和分析日志。

Result: 在斯坦福无人机数据集的死亡圆环场景中对骑行者、滑板者和手推车类别进行了实证验证，展示了GM3模型能够更准确地捕捉微移动车辆的动力学行为。

Conclusion: GM3模型提供了一个统一的物理基础框架，能够更好地建模微移动车辆的复杂动力学特性，包括轮胎滑移、载荷转移和倾斜效应，为自动驾驶系统训练和城市交通仿真提供了更准确的工具。

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of micro-mobility vehicles (MMV) is becoming
increasingly important for training autonomous vehicle systems and building
urban traffic simulations. However, mainstream tools rely on variants of the
Kinematic Bicycle Model (KBM) or mode-specific physics that miss tire slip,
load transfer, and rider/vehicle lean. To our knowledge, no unified,
physics-based model captures these dynamics across the full range of common
MMVs and wheel layouts. We propose the "Generalized Micro-mobility Model"
(GM3), a tire-level formulation based on the tire brush representation that
supports arbitrary wheel configurations, including single/double track and
multi-wheel platforms. We introduce an interactive model-agnostic simulation
framework that decouples vehicle/layout specification from dynamics to compare
the GM3 with the KBM and other models, consisting of fixed step RK4
integration, human-in-the-loop and scripted control, real-time trajectory
traces and logging for analysis. We also empirically validate the GM3 on the
Stanford Drone Dataset's deathCircle (roundabout) scene for biker, skater, and
cart classes.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DM1提出了一种新的流匹配框架，通过分散正则化防止表示崩溃，在保持一步生成效率的同时显著提升机器人操作任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于流的策略存在表示崩溃问题，无法区分相似的视觉表示，导致在精确操作任务中失败。需要一种既能保持一步生成效率又能防止表示崩溃的方法。

Method: 在MeanFlow框架中集成分散正则化，在多个中间嵌入层应用不同变体的分散正则化，鼓励训练批次间的多样化表示，无需额外网络模块或专门训练过程。

Result: 在RoboMimic基准测试中，DM1实现了20-40倍更快的推理速度（0.07s vs 2-3.5s），成功率提升10-20个百分点，Lift任务达到99%成功率（基线为85%）。真实机器人部署验证了从仿真到物理世界的有效迁移。

Conclusion: 这是首个利用表示正则化使基于流的策略在机器人操作中实现强性能的工作，为高效鲁棒的操作提供了一种简单而强大的方法。

Abstract: The ability to learn multi-modal action distributions is indispensable for
robotic manipulation policies to perform precise and robust control. Flow-based
generative models have recently emerged as a promising solution to learning
distributions of actions, offering one-step action generation and thus
achieving much higher sampling efficiency compared to diffusion-based methods.
However, existing flow-based policies suffer from representation collapse, the
inability to distinguish similar visual representations, leading to failures in
precise manipulation tasks. We propose DM1 (MeanFlow with Dispersive
Regularization for One-Step Robotic Manipulation), a novel flow matching
framework that integrates dispersive regularization into MeanFlow to prevent
collapse while maintaining one-step efficiency. DM1 employs multiple dispersive
regularization variants across different intermediate embedding layers,
encouraging diverse representations across training batches without introducing
additional network modules or specialized training procedures. Experiments on
RoboMimic benchmarks show that DM1 achieves 20-40 times faster inference (0.07s
vs. 2-3.5s) and improves success rates by 10-20 percentage points, with the
Lift task reaching 99% success over 85% of the baseline. Real-robot deployment
on a Franka Panda further validates that DM1 transfers effectively from
simulation to the physical world. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work to leverage representation regularization to enable flow-based
policies to achieve strong performance in robotic manipulation, establishing a
simple yet powerful approach for efficient and robust manipulation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下环境对机器人操作具有独特挑战，包括复杂流体动力学、有限能见度和受限通信。由于缺乏大规模高质量水下数据集，开发能够自主执行多任务的水下智能系统仍然极具挑战性。

Method: 提出USIM仿真数据集，包含56.1万帧数据、1852条轨迹，覆盖20个任务和9种场景。基于此构建U0视觉-语言-动作模型，通过双目视觉和多传感器模态融合，并引入卷积注意力感知聚焦增强模块来提升空间理解和移动操作能力。

Conclusion: USIM和U0表明视觉-语言-动作模型可以有效地应用于水下机器人应用，为可扩展数据集构建、改进任务自主性和智能通用水下机器人的实际实现提供了基础。

Abstract: Underwater environments present unique challenges for robotic operation,
including complex hydrodynamics, limited visibility, and constrained
communication. Although data-driven approaches have advanced embodied
intelligence in terrestrial robots and enabled task-specific autonomous
underwater robots, developing underwater intelligence capable of autonomously
performing multiple tasks remains highly challenging, as large-scale,
high-quality underwater datasets are still scarce. To address these
limitations, we introduce USIM, a simulation-based multi-task
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) dataset for underwater robots. USIM comprises over
561K frames from 1,852 trajectories, totaling approximately 15.6 hours of
BlueROV2 interactions across 20 tasks in 9 diverse scenarios, ranging from
visual navigation to mobile manipulation. Building upon this dataset, we
propose U0, a VLA model for general underwater robots, which integrates
binocular vision and other sensor modalities through multimodal fusion, and
further incorporates a convolution-attention-based perception focus enhancement
module (CAP) to improve spatial understanding and mobile manipulation. Across
tasks such as inspection, obstacle avoidance, scanning, and dynamic tracking,
the framework achieves a success rate of 80%, while in challenging mobile
manipulation tasks, it reduces the distance to the target by 21.2% compared
with baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness. USIM and U0 show that
VLA models can be effectively applied to underwater robotic applications,
providing a foundation for scalable dataset construction, improved task
autonomy, and the practical realization of intelligent general underwater
robots.

Motivation: 解决机器人在动态人流量大的室内环境中进行安全、高效且符合社会规范的导航问题，特别是在仅使用机载RGB-D传感器和里程计的情况下。

Method: 在Falcon模型基础上引入主动风险感知模块，通过学习预测周围行人的基于距离的碰撞风险分数，增强空间感知和主动避障能力。

Result: 在Social-HM3D基准测试中，该方法显著提升了机器人在拥挤室内场景中保持个人空间合规性的能力，在16支参赛队伍中排名第二。

Conclusion: 主动风险感知模块能够有效增强机器人的社会导航性能，特别是在动态人流量环境中，证明了基于风险预测的方法在提升机器人社会合规导航方面的有效性。

Abstract: In this report, we describe the technical details of our submission to the
IROS 2025 RoboSense Challenge Social Navigation Track. This track focuses on
developing RGBD-based perception and navigation systems that enable autonomous
agents to navigate safely, efficiently, and socially compliantly in dynamic
human-populated indoor environments. The challenge requires agents to operate
from an egocentric perspective using only onboard sensors including RGB-D
observations and odometry, without access to global maps or privileged
information, while maintaining social norm compliance such as safe distances
and collision avoidance. Building upon the Falcon model, we introduce a
Proactive Risk Perception Module to enhance social navigation performance. Our
approach augments Falcon with collision risk understanding that learns to
predict distance-based collision risk scores for surrounding humans, which
enables the agent to develop more robust spatial awareness and proactive
collision avoidance behaviors. The evaluation on the Social-HM3D benchmark
demonstrates that our method improves the agent's ability to maintain personal
space compliance while navigating toward goals in crowded indoor scenes with
dynamic human agents, achieving 2nd place among 16 participating teams in the
challenge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在双臂人形机器人的长时任务规划中效果有限，主要由于缺乏系统评估平台和模型缺乏对机器人身体状态的感知能力。

Method: 开发DualTHOR仿真器，并提出Proprio-MLLM模型，通过运动位置嵌入和跨空间编码器整合本体感知信息。

Result: Proprio-MLLM在规划性能上平均提升19.75%，而现有MLLMs在该环境中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 该工作为推进人形机器人具身智能提供了必要的仿真平台和有效模型。

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
the ability to serve as high-level planners, enabling robots to follow complex
human instructions. However, their effectiveness, especially in long-horizon
tasks involving dual-arm humanoid robots, remains limited. This limitation
arises from two main challenges: (i) the absence of simulation platforms that
systematically support task evaluation and data collection for humanoid robots,
and (ii) the insufficient embodiment awareness of current MLLMs, which hinders
reasoning about dual-arm selection logic and body positions during planning. To
address these issues, we present DualTHOR, a new dual-arm humanoid simulator,
with continuous transition and a contingency mechanism. Building on this
platform, we propose Proprio-MLLM, a model that enhances embodiment awareness
by incorporating proprioceptive information with motion-based position
embedding and a cross-spatial encoder. Experiments show that, while existing
MLLMs struggle in this environment, Proprio-MLLM achieves an average
improvement of 19.75% in planning performance. Our work provides both an
essential simulation platform and an effective model to advance embodied
intelligence in humanoid robotics. The code is available at

TL;DR: GRACE框架通过可执行分析概念（EAC）弥合视觉语言模型与机器人物理执行之间的语义-物理鸿沟，实现精确和通用的机器人操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型在语义推理和任务规划方面的能力与机器人实际物理执行之间的差距，使机器人能在非结构化环境中进行精确和通用的操作。

Method: 提出GRACE框架，通过可执行分析概念（EAC）将自然语言指令和视觉信息转化为数学定义的蓝图，编码物体功能、几何约束和操作语义，进而推导抓取姿态、力方向和物理可行的运动轨迹。

Result: 在模拟和真实环境中的广泛实验表明，GRACE在各种关节物体上实现了强大的零样本泛化能力，无需任务特定训练。

Conclusion: GRACE提供了一个统一且可解释的接口，有效连接高层指令理解与低层机器人控制，通过语义-物理接地实现精确和通用的操作。

Abstract: Enabling robots to perform precise and generalized manipulation in
unstructured environments remains a fundamental challenge in embodied AI. While
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
semantic reasoning and task planning, a significant gap persists between their
high-level understanding and the precise physical execution required for
real-world manipulation. To bridge this "semantic-to-physical" gap, we
introduce GRACE, a novel framework that grounds VLM-based reasoning through
executable analytic concepts (EAC)-mathematically defined blueprints that
encode object affordances, geometric constraints, and semantics of
manipulation. Our approach integrates a structured policy scaffolding pipeline
that turn natural language instructions and visual information into an
instantiated EAC, from which we derive grasp poses, force directions and plan
physically feasible motion trajectory for robot execution. GRACE thus provides
a unified and interpretable interface between high-level instruction
understanding and low-level robot control, effectively enabling precise and
generalizable manipulation through semantic-physical grounding. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GRACE achieves strong zero-shot generalization
across a variety of articulated objects in both simulated and real-world
environments, without requiring task-specific training.

TL;DR: 提出基于角度-轴空间的方向表示方法，通过加权平均机制在SO(3)流形上融合多条轨迹，同时处理多个局部约束，解决非欧几何带来的扭曲问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旋转群SO(3)是黎曼流形，其非欧几何特性导致局部约束难以整合，特别是同时处理多个局部约束时存在困难。

Method: 使用角度-轴表示法，在不同基点考虑不同局部约束生成多条轨迹，然后通过加权平均机制融合这些轨迹生成平滑轨迹。

Result: 仿真和实验验证表明，该方法能够适应任意期望路径点的方向，处理角加速度约束，同时整合多个局部约束以获得额外收益（如更小的加速度成本）。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法解决了SO(3)流形中的扭曲问题，使现成的欧几里得学习算法在非欧空间中重新适用，能够同时处理多个局部约束。

Abstract: Orientation learning plays a pivotal role in many tasks. However, the
rotation group SO(3) is a Riemannian manifold. As a result, the distortion
caused by non-Euclidean geometric nature introduces difficulties to the
incorporation of local constraints, especially for the simultaneous
incorporation of multiple local constraints. To address this issue, we propose
the Angle-Axis Space-based orientation representation method to solve several
orientation learning problems, including orientation adaptation and
minimization of angular acceleration. Specifically, we propose a weighted
average mechanism in SO(3) based on the angle-axis representation method. Our
main idea is to generate multiple trajectories by considering different local
constraints at different basepoints. Then these multiple trajectories are fused
to generate a smooth trajectory by our proposed weighted average mechanism,
achieving the goal to incorporate multiple local constraints simultaneously.
Compared with existing solution, ours can address the distortion issue and make
the off-theshelf Euclidean learning algorithm be re-applicable in non-Euclidean
space. Simulation and Experimental evaluations validate that our solution can
not only adapt orientations towards arbitrary desired via-points and cope with
angular acceleration constraints, but also incorporate multiple local
constraints simultaneously to achieve extra benefits, e.g., achieving smaller
acceleration costs.

to fulfill the diverse requirements of real-world robot demonstration data.
Specifically, FastUMI-100K contains over 100K+ demonstration trajectories

Conclusion: CURE方法通过分解不同类型的不确定性，显著提高了LLM在机器人规划中的可靠性，为安全可靠的具身规划提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate advanced reasoning abilities,
enabling robots to understand natural language instructions and generate
high-level plans with appropriate grounding. However, LLM hallucinations
present a significant challenge, often leading to overconfident yet potentially
misaligned or unsafe plans. While researchers have explored uncertainty
estimation to improve the reliability of LLM-based planning, existing studies
have not sufficiently differentiated between epistemic and intrinsic
uncertainty, limiting the effectiveness of uncertainty estimation. In this
paper, we present Combined Uncertainty estimation for Reliable Embodied
planning (CURE), which decomposes the uncertainty into epistemic and intrinsic
uncertainty, each estimated separately. Furthermore, epistemic uncertainty is
subdivided into task clarity and task familiarity for more accurate evaluation.
The overall uncertainty assessments are obtained using random network
distillation and multi-layer perceptron regression heads driven by LLM
features. We validated our approach in two distinct experimental settings:
kitchen manipulation and tabletop rearrangement experiments. The results show
that, compared to existing methods, our approach yields uncertainty estimates
that are more closely aligned with the actual execution outcomes.

Abstract: Liver disease is a major global health burden. While ultrasound is the
first-line diagnostic tool, liver sonography requires locating multiple
non-continuous planes from positions where target structures are often not
visible, for biometric assessment and lesion detection, requiring significant
expertise. However, expert sonographers are severely scarce in resource-limited
regions. Here, we develop an autonomous lightweight ultrasound robot comprising
an AI agent that integrates multi-modal perception with memory attention for
localization of unseen target structures, and a 588-gram 6-degrees-of-freedom
cable-driven robot. By mounting on the abdomen, the system enhances robustness
against motion. Our robot can autonomously acquire expert-level standard liver
ultrasound planes and detect pathology in patients, including two from Xining,
a 2261-meter-altitude city with limited medical resources. Our system performs
effectively on rapid-motion individuals and in wilderness environments. This
work represents the first demonstration of autonomous sonography across
multiple challenging scenarios, potentially transforming access to expert-level

Abstract: Robotic Process Mining focuses on the identification of the routine types
performed by human resources through a User Interface. The ultimate goal is to
discover routine-type models to enable robotic process automation. The
discovery of routine-type models requires the provision of a routine log.
Unfortunately, the vast majority of existing works do not directly focus on
enabling the model discovery, limiting themselves to extracting the set of
actions that are part of the routines. They were also not evaluated in
scenarios characterized by inconsistent routine execution, hereafter referred
to as noise, which reflects natural variability and occasional errors in human
performance. This paper presents a clustering-based technique that aims to
extract routine logs. Experiments were conducted on nine UI logs from the
literature with different levels of injected noise. Our technique was compared
with existing techniques, most of which are not meant to discover routine logs
but were adapted for the purpose. The results were evaluated through standard
state-of-the-art metrics, showing that we can extract more accurate routine
logs than what the state of the art could, especially in the presence of noise.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于单级重构的逆最优控制方法，相比传统的双层方法计算速度提升15倍，同时对噪声具有很高的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有逆最优控制方法要么基于计算缓慢的双层过程，要么基于快速但对噪声敏感的优化条件违反最小化方法。需要一种既快速又鲁棒的IOC方法。

Method: 采用单级重构方法替代传统的双层IOC方法，基于等式约束的最优控制模型来重构问题。

Result: 在仿真实验中，该方法对噪声表现出很强的鲁棒性，在平面到达任务中的计算时间比传统双层实现减少了15倍。

Conclusion: 单级重构方法在保持结果等效性的同时，显著提高了计算效率并增强了噪声鲁棒性，为逆最优控制提供了一种更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Inverse optimal control (IOC) allows the retrieval of optimal cost function
weights, or behavioral parameters, from human motion. The literature on IOC
uses methods that are either based on a slow bilevel process or a fast but
noise-sensitive minimization of optimality condition violation. Assuming
equality-constrained optimal control models of human motion, this article
presents a faster but robust approach to solving IOC using a single-level
reformulation of the bilevel method and yields equivalent results. Through
numerical experiments in simulation, we analyze the robustness to noise of the
proposed single-level reformulation to the bilevel IOC formulation with a
human-like planar reaching task that is used across recent studies. The
approach shows resilience to very large levels of noise and reduces the
computation time of the IOC on this task by a factor of 15 when compared to a
classical bilevel implementation.

Abstract: Instruction-following navigation is a key step toward embodied intelligence.
Prior benchmarks mainly focus on semantic understanding but overlook
systematically evaluating navigation agents' spatial perception and reasoning
capabilities. In this work, we introduce the NavSpace benchmark, which contains
six task categories and 1,228 trajectory-instruction pairs designed to probe
the spatial intelligence of navigation agents. On this benchmark, we
comprehensively evaluate 22 navigation agents, including state-of-the-art
navigation models and multimodal large language models. The evaluation results
lift the veil on spatial intelligence in embodied navigation. Furthermore, we
propose SNav, a new spatially intelligent navigation model. SNav outperforms
existing navigation agents on NavSpace and real robot tests, establishing a
strong baseline for future work.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该研究比较了传统PID控制器与现代强化学习算法在电缆驱动并联机器人控制中的性能，发现TRPO在多种轨迹下均表现最佳，具有最低的RMS误差和对更大时间间隔的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估在时间离散化受限的真实世界电缆驱动并联机器人中，经典控制方法与现代强化学习算法的性能差异，特别是在欠约束系统中的应用。

Method: 对经典PID控制器和现代强化学习算法（包括DDPG、PPO和TRPO）进行对比分析，重点关注在有限时间离散化条件下的控制性能。

Result: TRPO在所有方法中表现最优，在各种轨迹下实现了最低的均方根误差，并且对控制更新之间的较大时间间隔表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TRPO在平衡探索与利用方面的能力使其能够在嘈杂的真实世界环境中实现稳定控制，减少对高频传感器反馈和计算资源的需求，为复杂机器人控制任务提供了鲁棒解决方案。

Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of classical and modern control methods
for real-world Cable-Driven Parallel Robots (CDPRs), focusing on
underconstrained systems with limited time discretization. A comparative
analysis is conducted between classical PID controllers and modern
reinforcement learning algorithms, including Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient
(DDPG), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Trust Region Policy
Optimization (TRPO). The results demonstrate that TRPO outperforms other
methods, achieving the lowest root mean square (RMS) errors across various
trajectories and exhibiting robustness to larger time intervals between control
updates. TRPO's ability to balance exploration and exploitation enables stable
control in noisy, real-world environments, reducing reliance on high-frequency
sensor feedback and computational demands. These findings highlight TRPO's
potential as a robust solution for complex robotic control tasks, with
implications for dynamic environments and future applications in sensor fusion
or hybrid control strategies.

TL;DR: Airy是一个艺术装置，通过两个强化学习的机械臂竞争抖床单来可视化多智能体AI的决策过程，使复杂的机器意图变得直观可理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着工业机器人进入共享人类空间，其不透明的决策过程威胁着安全、信任和公共监督。该作品旨在探索复杂多智能体AI能否变得直观可理解。

Method: 基于三个设计原则：竞争作为清晰指标（谁举得更高）、具身熟悉性（观众识别抖床单动作）、传感器到感知映射（通过森林和天气投影显示机器人合作或竞争），创建一个艺术装置。

Result: 在五个国际展览中的观察表明，观众能够实时解读机器人的策略、冲突和合作，情感反应与系统内部状态一致。

Conclusion: 该项目展示了感官隐喻如何将黑盒系统转变为公共接口，使复杂的AI决策变得可读和可理解。

Abstract: As industrial robots move into shared human spaces, their opaque decision
making threatens safety, trust, and public oversight. This artwork, Airy, asks
whether complex multi agent AI can become intuitively understandable by staging
a competition between two reinforcement trained robot arms that snap a bedsheet
skyward. Building on three design principles, competition as a clear metric
(who lifts higher), embodied familiarity (audiences recognize fabric snapping),
and sensor to sense mapping (robot cooperation or rivalry shown through forest
and weather projections), the installation gives viewers a visceral way to read
machine intent. Observations from five international exhibitions indicate that
audiences consistently read the robots' strategies, conflict, and cooperation
in real time, with emotional reactions that mirror the system's internal state.
The project shows how sensory metaphors can turn a black box into a public
interface.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要验证6-6 Stewart-Gough平台机械臂在给定平台方向下的最大无碰撞球体尺寸，确保机械臂在工作空间内的安全操作。

Method: 利用CAD软件的API自动化更新移动平台位置，在CFS表面的壳层内采样，对每个姿态检查各对腿部之间的相互碰撞。

Result: 该方法能够验证预计算CFS的安全性，并可估计任何空间并联机械臂的无碰撞球体。

Conclusion: 所提出的基于CAD API的验证方法可以有效验证6-6 Stewart-Gough平台机械臂的无碰撞球体尺寸，为空间并联机械臂的安全操作提供保障。

Abstract: This paper presents a method of validation of the size of the largest
collision-free sphere (CFS) of a 6-6 Stewart-Gough platform manipulator (SGPM)
for a given orientation of its moving platform (MP) using the Application
Programming Interface (API) of a CAD software. The position of the MP is
updated via the API in an automated manner over a set of samples within a shell
enclosing the surface of the CFS. For each pose of the manipulator, each pair
of legs is investigated for mutual collisions. The CFS is considered safe or
validated iff none of the points falling inside the CFS lead to a collision
between any pair of legs. This approach can not only validate the safety of a
precomputed CFS, but also estimate the same for any spatial parallel
manipulator.

TL;DR: GLUESTICK是一种后剪枝恢复方法，通过权重空间插值在稀疏模型和原始模型之间计算校正项，无需额外训练即可恢复VLA模型剪枝后的性能损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA模型在资源受限硬件上部署困难，剪枝方法在机器人领域研究不足，且现有剪枝会导致性能急剧下降和安全违规增加。

Method: 在权重空间对密集模型和剪枝模型进行一次性插值计算校正项，推理时每个剪枝层使用该校正项恢复丢失的能力，仅引入一个控制效率与精度权衡的超参数。

Result: 在多种VLA架构和操作导航任务中，GLUESTICK实现了竞争性的内存效率，同时大幅恢复成功率并减少安全违规。

Conclusion: GLUESTICK提供了一种无需训练、与剪枝算法无关的有效方法，在保持稀疏性优势的同时显著改善剪枝VLA模型的性能和安全表现。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced robotic capabilities but
remain challenging to deploy on resource-limited hardware. Pruning has enabled
efficient compression of large language models (LLMs), yet it is largely
understudied in robotics. Surprisingly, we observe that pruning VLA models
leads to drastic degradation and increased safety violations. We introduce
GLUESTICK, a post-pruning recovery method that restores much of the original
model's functionality while retaining sparsity benefits. Our method performs a
one-time interpolation between the dense and pruned models in weight-space to
compute a corrective term. This correction is used during inference by each
pruned layer to recover lost capabilities with minimal overhead. GLUESTICK
requires no additional training, is agnostic to the pruning algorithm, and
introduces a single hyperparameter that controls the tradeoff between
efficiency and accuracy. Across diverse VLA architectures and tasks in
manipulation and navigation, GLUESTICK achieves competitive memory efficiency
while substantially recovering success rates and reducing safety violations.

Motivation: 解决现有方法仅考虑简化浮动手部、需要大量手动数据收集和昂贵运动捕捉的问题，实现从野外视频直接学习灵巧操作技能。

Method: 使用第三方人类操作视频，通过接触奖励改进策略学习，直接控制类人机器人，无需相机标定或深度传感器。

Result: 在TACO基准测试中实现最先进的物体姿态估计性能（ADD-S和VSD分别提升0.08和0.12），在OakInk-v2上成功率比先前方法提高19%。

Conclusion: DexMan能够从真实和合成视频生成技能，无需手动数据收集和昂贵运动捕捉，为训练通用灵巧操作创建大规模多样化数据集。

Abstract: We present DexMan, an automated framework that converts human visual
demonstrations into bimanual dexterous manipulation skills for humanoid robots
in simulation. Operating directly on third-person videos of humans manipulating
rigid objects, DexMan eliminates the need for camera calibration, depth
sensors, scanned 3D object assets, or ground-truth hand and object motion
annotations. Unlike prior approaches that consider only simplified floating
hands, it directly controls a humanoid robot and leverages novel contact-based
rewards to improve policy learning from noisy hand-object poses estimated from
in-the-wild videos.
  DexMan achieves state-of-the-art performance in object pose estimation on the
TACO benchmark, with absolute gains of 0.08 and 0.12 in ADD-S and VSD.
Meanwhile, its reinforcement learning policy surpasses previous methods by 19%
in success rate on OakInk-v2. Furthermore, DexMan can generate skills from both
real and synthetic videos, without the need for manual data collection and
costly motion capture, and enabling the creation of large-scale, diverse
datasets for training generalist dexterous manipulation.

Conclusion: R2RGen框架有效解决了空间泛化问题，为广义机器人操作提供了高效的数据增强解决方案。

Abstract: Towards the aim of generalized robotic manipulation, spatial generalization
is the most fundamental capability that requires the policy to work robustly
under different spatial distribution of objects, environment and agent itself.
To achieve this, substantial human demonstrations need to be collected to cover
different spatial configurations for training a generalized visuomotor policy
via imitation learning. Prior works explore a promising direction that
leverages data generation to acquire abundant spatially diverse data from
minimal source demonstrations. However, most approaches face significant
sim-to-real gap and are often limited to constrained settings, such as
fixed-base scenarios and predefined camera viewpoints. In this paper, we
propose a real-to-real 3D data generation framework (R2RGen) that directly
augments the pointcloud observation-action pairs to generate real-world data.
R2RGen is simulator- and rendering-free, thus being efficient and
plug-and-play. Specifically, given a single source demonstration, we introduce
an annotation mechanism for fine-grained parsing of scene and trajectory. A
group-wise augmentation strategy is proposed to handle complex multi-object
compositions and diverse task constraints. We further present camera-aware
processing to align the distribution of generated data with real-world 3D
sensor. Empirically, R2RGen substantially enhances data efficiency on extensive
experiments and demonstrates strong potential for scaling and application on
mobile manipulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人手内物体旋转任务中从仿真到真实世界的泛化挑战，克服传统方法在复杂几何形状、尺寸限制、手腕姿态约束等方面的局限性。

Method: 使用关节级动力学模型学习真实世界数据以弥合现实差距，通过关节动态分解、低维变量压缩和自主数据收集策略，实现高效的数据利用和跨关节的泛化能力。

Result: 单个策略成功旋转复杂形状物体（如动物模型）、高宽比物体（达5.33）和小尺寸物体，同时处理多样手腕方向和旋转轴，在真实世界评估和遥操作应用中验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法在sim-to-real手内旋转任务中实现了前所未有的泛化能力，为复杂接触丰富的灵巧操作任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Achieving generalized in-hand object rotation remains a significant challenge
in robotics, largely due to the difficulty of transferring policies from
simulation to the real world. The complex, contact-rich dynamics of dexterous
manipulation create a "reality gap" that has limited prior work to constrained
scenarios involving simple geometries, limited object sizes and aspect ratios,
constrained wrist poses, or customized hands. We address this sim-to-real
challenge with a novel framework that enables a single policy, trained in
simulation, to generalize to a wide variety of objects and conditions in the
real world. The core of our method is a joint-wise dynamics model that learns
to bridge the reality gap by effectively fitting limited amount of real-world
collected data and then adapting the sim policy's actions accordingly. The
model is highly data-efficient and generalizable across different whole-hand
interaction distributions by factorizing dynamics across joints, compressing
system-wide influences into low-dimensional variables, and learning each
joint's evolution from its own dynamic profile, implicitly capturing these net
effects. We pair this with a fully autonomous data collection strategy that
gathers diverse, real-world interaction data with minimal human intervention.
Our complete pipeline demonstrates unprecedented generality: a single policy
successfully rotates challenging objects with complex shapes (e.g., animals),
high aspect ratios (up to 5.33), and small sizes, all while handling diverse
wrist orientations and rotation axes. Comprehensive real-world evaluations and
a teleoperation application for complex tasks validate the effectiveness and
robustness of our approach. Website: https://meowuu7.github.io/DexNDM/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器人操作方法通常需要分布内任务或特定平台数据微调，限制了跨平台迁移能力。NovaFlow旨在实现零样本任务执行，无需演示即可将任务描述转换为不同机器人的可执行计划。

Method: 使用视频生成模型根据任务描述合成视频，通过现成感知模块提取3D物体流。对于刚性物体，计算相对位姿并通过抓取提议和轨迹优化实现；对于可变形物体，将物体流作为基于粒子动力学模型的跟踪目标。

Conclusion: NovaFlow通过将任务理解与底层控制解耦，实现了跨平台的零样本机器人操作，为机器人自主执行新任务提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Enabling robots to execute novel manipulation tasks zero-shot is a central
goal in robotics. Most existing methods assume in-distribution tasks or rely on
fine-tuning with embodiment-matched data, limiting transfer across platforms.
We present NovaFlow, an autonomous manipulation framework that converts a task
description into an actionable plan for a target robot without any
demonstrations. Given a task description, NovaFlow synthesizes a video using a
video generation model and distills it into 3D actionable object flow using
off-the-shelf perception modules. From the object flow, it computes relative
poses for rigid objects and realizes them as robot actions via grasp proposals
and trajectory optimization. For deformable objects, this flow serves as a
tracking objective for model-based planning with a particle-based dynamics
model. By decoupling task understanding from low-level control, NovaFlow
naturally transfers across embodiments. We validate on rigid, articulated, and
deformable object manipulation tasks using a table-top Franka arm and a Spot
quadrupedal mobile robot, and achieve effective zero-shot execution without
demonstrations or embodiment-specific training. Project website:

TL;DR: 本文研究发现感知规划模型的离线评估与在线性能之间存在弱相关性，提出了基于认知不确定性的离线指标，显著提升了离线与在线评估的相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器人系统（如自动驾驶车辆）的感知规划模型主要通过离线评估进行验证，但离线性能难以准确预测在线实际表现，这种差距在复杂城市环境中尤为明显。

Method: 通过大量仿真实验分析离线与在线评估的相关性，提出基于认知不确定性的离线指标来捕捉可能导致闭环错误的场景。

Result: 发现离线与在线评估的相关性比先前研究报道的更差，提出的新指标相比传统离线指标提升了13%以上的相关性，在真实环境中效果更显著。

Conclusion: 当前驾驶策略评估实践存在有效性疑问，基于认知不确定性的离线指标能更好桥接离线与在线评估的差距。

Abstract: Real-World evaluation of perception-based planning models for robotic
systems, such as autonomous vehicles, can be safely and inexpensively conducted
offline, i.e., by computing model prediction error over a pre-collected
validation dataset with ground-truth annotations. However, extrapolating from
offline model performance to online settings remains a challenge. In these
settings, seemingly minor errors can compound and result in test-time
infractions or collisions. This relationship is understudied, particularly
across diverse closed-loop metrics and complex urban maneuvers. In this work,
we revisit this undervalued question in policy evaluation through an extensive
set of experiments across diverse conditions and metrics. Based on analysis in
simulation, we find an even worse correlation between offline and online
settings than reported by prior studies, casting doubts on the validity of
current evaluation practices and metrics for driving policies. Next, we bridge
the gap between offline and online evaluation. We investigate an offline metric
based on epistemic uncertainty, which aims to capture events that are likely to
cause errors in closed-loop settings. The resulting metric achieves over 13%
improvement in correlation compared to previous offline metrics. We further
validate the generalization of our findings beyond the simulation environment
in real-world settings, where even greater gains are observed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人领域缺乏互联网规模的多样化任务演示数据，现有数据集规模受限，需要手动收集和整理。

Method: 基于LLM规划器的零样本能力自动生成模拟器中的操作演示，用成功示例微调LLM，无需人工监督。

Result: BLAZER显著提升了模拟和真实环境中的零样本操作能力，在训练池外任务上也有改进，并能缩小LLM模型规模。

Conclusion: BLAZER通过自动生成训练数据有效解决了机器人领域数据稀缺问题，实现了从模拟到真实环境的技能迁移。

Abstract: Scaling data and models has played a pivotal role in the remarkable progress
of computer vision and language. Inspired by these domains, recent efforts in
robotics have similarly focused on scaling both data and model size to develop
more generalizable and robust policies. However, unlike vision and language,
robotics lacks access to internet-scale demonstrations across diverse robotic
tasks and environments. As a result, the scale of existing datasets typically
suffers from the need for manual data collection and curation. To address this
problem, here we propose BLAZER, a framework that learns manipulation policies
from automatically generated training data. We build on the zero-shot
capabilities of LLM planners and automatically generate demonstrations for
diverse manipulation tasks in simulation. Successful examples are then used to
finetune an LLM and to improve its planning capabilities without human
supervision. Notably, while BLAZER training requires access to the simulator's
state, we demonstrate direct transfer of acquired skills to sensor-based
manipulation. Through extensive experiments, we show BLAZER to significantly
improve zero-shot manipulation in both simulated and real environments.
Moreover, BLAZER improves on tasks outside of its training pool and enables
downscaling of LLM models. Our code and data will be made publicly available on
the project page.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在模拟人类偏见和启发式行为时存在四种偏差：减少或纠正人类偏见、放大人类偏见、表现出与人类相反的偏见，以及响应不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI在替代消费者时是否能准确模拟人类行为，特别是在偏见和启发式决策领域。

Method: 通过10个实验研究大型语言模型在记录良好的偏见和启发式行为中的表现。

Result: 观察到四种偏离人类行为的模式：偏差减少/纠正、偏差放大、反向偏差以及响应不一致性。

Conclusion: 当LLMs用于模仿或预测消费者行为时，非人类化的响应是有问题的，表明偏见来源不一定是人类中心的。

Abstract: When Artificial Intelligence (AI) is used to replace consumers (e.g.,
synthetic data), it is often assumed that AI emulates established consumers,
and more generally human behaviors. Ten experiments with Large Language Models
(LLMs) investigate if this is true in the domain of well-documented biases and
heuristics. Across studies we observe four distinct types of deviations from
human-like behavior. First, in some cases, LLMs reduce or correct biases
observed in humans. Second, in other cases, LLMs amplify these same biases.
Third, and perhaps most intriguingly, LLMs sometimes exhibit biases opposite to
those found in humans. Fourth, LLMs' responses to the same (or similar) prompts
tend to be inconsistent (a) within the same model after a time delay, (b)
across models, and (c) among independent research studies. Such inconsistencies
can be uncharacteristic of humans and suggest that, at least at one point,
LLMs' responses differed from humans. Overall, unhuman-like responses are
problematic when LLMs are used to mimic or predict consumer behavior. These
findings complement research on synthetic consumer data by showing that sources
of bias are not necessarily human-centric. They also contribute to the debate
about the tasks for which consumers, and more generally humans, can be replaced
by AI.

Motivation: 随着无人机和混合现实头显市场的增长，需要更直观、沉浸式和情境感知的控制系统来改善传统控制界面的局限性。

Method: 开发了三个关键组件：3D地形图界面（支持拖拽航点标记和实时摄像头预览）、虚拟球体空间控制隐喻（用于精细控制）、空间叠加显示（帮助追踪不可见无人机）。

Result: 用户研究表明：3D地图界面直观易用，相比传统双摇杆控制器提高了准确性和一致性，降低了感知工作量；虚拟球体界面直观但缺乏物理反馈；空间叠加显示显著增强了用户的情境感知能力。

Abstract: As the markets for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and mixed reality (MR)
headsets continue to grow, recent research has increasingly explored their
integration, which enables more intuitive, immersive, and situationally aware
control systems. We present IGUANA, an MR-based immersive guidance, navigation,
and control system for consumer UAVs. IGUANA introduces three key elements
beyond conventional control interfaces: (1) a 3D terrain map interface with
draggable waypoint markers and live camera preview for high-level control, (2)
a novel spatial control metaphor that uses a virtual ball as a physical analogy
for low-level control, and (3) a spatial overlay that helps track the UAV when
it is not visible with the naked eye or visual line of sight is interrupted. We
conducted a user study to evaluate our design, both quantitatively and
qualitatively, and found that (1) the 3D map interface is intuitive and easy to
use, relieving users from manual control and suggesting improved accuracy and
consistency with lower perceived workload relative to conventional dual-stick
controller, (2) the virtual ball interface is intuitive but limited by the lack
of physical feedback, and (3) the spatial overlay is very useful in enhancing
the users' situational awareness.

Conclusion: Slow Space Editor成功简化了虚拟环境创建过程，使非专业用户也能受益于虚拟和混合现实环境，支持反思和注意力恢复的目的。

Abstract: The Slow Space Editor is a 2D tool for creating 3D spaces. It was built as
part of a research-through-design project that investigates how Virtual and
Mixed Reality (XR) environments might be used for reflection and attention
restoration. In this phase, we seek to radically simplify the creation of
virtual environments, thereby broadening the potential group of users who could
benefit from them. The research described in this paper has three aspects.
First, we define the concept of "slow space," situating it alongside existing
research in HCI and environmental psychology. Second, we report on a series of
interviews with professional designers about how slow spaces are created in the
physical world. Third, we share the design of the tool itself, focussing on the
benefits of providing a simple method for users to control their environments.
We conclude with our findings from a 19-person qualitative study of the tool.

TL;DR: 提出HOMI框架和NAF+方法，通过模型生成的合成用户数据训练优化器，提升人机交互界面优化的效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人机交互优化需要大量用户数据迭代，成本高昂且不实用，需要更高效的方法

Method: HOMI框架在部署前使用预测模型生成多样化合成用户数据训练优化器；NAF+是基于强化学习的贝叶斯优化方法，具有神经采集函数

Result: 在VR空中键盘优化任务中验证了HOMI和NAF+的有效性

Conclusion: 通过连接现场和计算机模拟优化过程，为更高效的界面自适应提供了新方法

Abstract: Human-in-the-loop optimization identifies optimal interface designs by
iteratively observing user performance. However, it often requires numerous
iterations due to the lack of prior information. While recent approaches have
accelerated this process by leveraging previous optimization data, collecting
user data remains costly and often impractical. We present a conceptual
framework, Human-in-the-Loop Optimization with Model-Informed Priors (HOMI),
which augments human-in-the-loop optimization with a training phase where the
optimizer learns adaptation strategies from diverse, synthetic user data
generated with predictive models before deployment. To realize HOMI, we
introduce Neural Acquisition Function+ (NAF+), a Bayesian optimization method
featuring a neural acquisition function trained with reinforcement learning.
NAF+ learns optimization strategies from large-scale synthetic data, improving
efficiency in real-time optimization with users. We evaluate HOMI and NAF+ with
mid-air keyboard optimization, a representative VR input task. Our work
presents a new approach for more efficient interface adaptation by bridging in
situ and in silico optimization processes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在生成式AI时代，传统强调组织和检索已有信息的模型已不足够，需要新的协作模式来处理AI自主生成的内容。

Method: 基于社会技术视角，通过能力框架（包括愿景构建、迭代对话、信息雕塑和好奇心驱动合成）概念化知识雕塑师角色，并通过实践案例展示其应用。

Result: 建立了知识雕塑师的专业原型，展示了如何通过人类与AI的协作将原始AI输出转化为高质量知识产品。

Conclusion: 知识雕塑师代表了生成式AI时代知识工作的新范式，强调人类在AI协作中的核心作用，论文本身也作为所描述雕塑过程的产物。

Abstract: In the Generative Age, the nature of knowledge work is transforming.
Traditional models that emphasise the organisation and retrieval of
pre-existing information are increasingly inadequate in the face of generative
AI (GenAI) systems capable of autonomous content creation. This paper
introduces the Knowledge Sculptor (KS), a new professional archetype for
Human-GenAI collaboration that transforms raw AI output into trustworthy,
actionable knowledge. Grounded in a socio-technical perspective, the KS is
conceptualised through a framework of competencies, including architecting a
vision, iterative dialogue, information sculpting, and curiosity-driven
synthesis. A practice-based vignette illustrates the KS role in action, and in
a self-referential approach, the paper itself serves as an artefact of the
sculpting process it describes.

*Emilio Estevan,María Sierra-Torralba,Eduardo López-Larraz,Luis Montesano*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文首次系统评估了自监督学习在可穿戴EEG睡眠分期中的应用，结果显示SSL能显著提升分类性能，在标签稀缺时效果尤其明显，可减少对人工标注的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可穿戴EEG设备收集了大量未标记数据，而深度学习睡眠评分需要大量标注数据。自监督学习可以弥合这一差距，利用未标记信号解决标签稀缺问题。

Method: 评估了一系列成熟的SSL方法，在两个使用Ikon Sleep可穿戴EEG头带采集的睡眠数据库上进行测试：BOAS（包含PSG和可穿戴EEG记录的高质量基准）和HOGAR（大量家庭自记录未标记数据）。定义了三个评估场景来研究标签效率、表示质量和跨数据集泛化能力。

Result: SSL持续将分类性能提升高达10%，在标签稀缺时增益尤为明显。SSL仅使用5%-10%的标记数据即可达到80%以上的临床级准确率，而监督方法需要两倍的标签。SSL表示对人群特征、记录环境和信号质量的变化具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 研究证明了SSL在实现可穿戴EEG标签高效睡眠分期方面的潜力，减少了对人工标注的依赖，推动了经济实惠的睡眠监测系统的发展。

Abstract: Wearable EEG devices have emerged as a promising alternative to
polysomnography (PSG). As affordable and scalable solutions, their widespread
adoption results in the collection of massive volumes of unlabeled data that
cannot be analyzed by clinicians at scale. Meanwhile, the recent success of
deep learning for sleep scoring has relied on large annotated datasets.
Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers an opportunity to bridge this gap,
leveraging unlabeled signals to address label scarcity and reduce annotation
effort. In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation of SSL for
sleep staging using wearable EEG. We investigate a range of well-established
SSL methods and evaluate them on two sleep databases acquired with the Ikon
Sleep wearable EEG headband: BOAS, a high-quality benchmark containing PSG and
wearable EEG recordings with consensus labels, and HOGAR, a large collection of
home-based, self-recorded, and unlabeled recordings. Three evaluation scenarios
are defined to study label efficiency, representation quality, and
cross-dataset generalization. Results show that SSL consistently improves
classification performance by up to 10% over supervised baselines, with gains
particularly evident when labeled data is scarce. SSL achieves clinical-grade
accuracy above 80% leveraging only 5% to 10% of labeled data, while the
supervised approach requires twice the labels. Additionally, SSL
representations prove robust to variations in population characteristics,
recording environments, and signal quality. Our findings demonstrate the
potential of SSL to enable label-efficient sleep staging with wearable EEG,
reducing reliance on manual annotations and advancing the development of
affordable sleep monitoring systems.

TL;DR: 研究开发了基于VR的Pre/Absence体验，通过存在-缺失辩证法整合有形与无形遗产，相比纸质材料更能增强文化意识、情感参与和批判性反思。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决消失建筑遗产因结构消失和历史记录碎片化带来的解释挑战，特别是针对唐代大明宫含元殿等案例。

Method: 采用混合方法研究，与考古学家、遗产管理者和访客进行形成性调查，设计基于存在-缺失辩证法的VR体验，并与纸质体验进行对比研究。

Result: 两种方法都能提高事实理解，但VR体验在增强文化意识、激发对损失的情感参与以及鼓励对遗产社会政治意义演变进行批判性反思方面效果更显著。

Conclusion: VR可以超越静态重建，让用户成为文化意义的共同建构者，为人机交互中的批判性遗产叙事设计提供细致框架。

Abstract: Lost architectural heritage presents interpretive challenges due to vanished
structures and fragmented historical records. Using Hanyuan Hall of the Tang
dynasty's Daming Palace as a case study, we conducted a formative investigation
with archaeologists, heritage administrators, and visitors to identify key
issues in current interpretation practices. We found that these practices often
compress complex cultural layers into factual summaries and rely on linear
narratives that overlook the continuing reinterpretations following a site's
disappearance. In response, we designed Pre/Absence, a virtual reality
experience grounded in the presence-absence dialectic to interweave tangible
and vanished aspects of heritage within a spatiotemporal narrative. A
mixed-method study with 28 participants compared Pre/Absence to a paper-based
experience. Both improved users' factual understanding, but the VR experience
more strongly enhanced cultural awareness, evoked emotional engagement with
loss, and encouraged critical reflection on the evolving social and political
meanings of heritage. The findings suggest that VR can move beyond static
reconstruction to engage users as co-constructors of cultural meaning,
providing a nuanced framework for critical heritage narrative design in
human-computer interaction.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了六种VR移动技术对上下肢健全用户和上肢障碍用户的可访问性差异，发现滑动观察技术在两组用户中表现相似，可能是VR应用的理想默认移动技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VR系统假设用户具有典型身体能力，这使得VR对上肢障碍用户不可访问。需要了解哪些移动技术不可访问以及哪些交互造成了这种不可访问性。

Method: 让有和没有上肢障碍的用户使用六种移动技术在虚拟环境中导航，收集控制器和头显的低级交互数据，分析运动、按钮和目标相关指标。

Result: 滑动观察技术在两组用户中表现相似；运动相关指标能有效识别上肢障碍用户；确定了能解释特定移动技术性能差异的具体指标。

Conclusion: 滑动观察技术可作为VR应用的默认移动技术；运动相关指标是识别上肢障碍用户的有效方法；特定指标能解释不同移动技术对障碍用户的性能影响。

Abstract: Today's virtual reality (VR) systems and environments assume that users have
typical abilities, which can make VR inaccessible to people with physical
impairments. However, there is not yet an understanding of how inaccessible
locomotion techniques are, and which interactions make them inaccessible. To
this end, we conducted a study in which people with and without upper-body
impairments navigated a virtual environment with six locomotion techniques to
quantify performance differences among groups. We found that groups performed
similarly with Sliding Looking on all performance measures, suggesting that
this might be a good default locomotion technique for VR apps. To understand
the nature of performance differences with the other techniques, we collected
low-level interaction data from the controllers and headset and analyzed
interaction differences with a set of movement-, button-, and target-related
metrics. We found that movement-related metrics from headset data reveal
differences among groups with all techniques, suggesting these are good metrics
for identifying whether a user has an upper-body impairment. We also identify
movement-, button, and target-related metrics that can explain performance
differences between groups for particular locomotion techniques.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注AI代理的设计和协作设置，但忽视了决策者通过与AI系统持续互动而不断发展的心理模型。

Method: 开发了一个综合的社会技术框架，识别驱动心理模型演化的机制：数据情境化、推理透明度和性能反馈。

Result: 建立了三种不同的心理模型（领域、信息处理、互补性意识），认识到心理模型的动态性质，并确立了指导有效人机协作设计的机制。

Conclusion: 该研究通过引入三种心理模型、认识心理模型的动态性质以及建立指导有效人机协作设计的机制，推动了人机协作文献的发展。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has become integral to organizational decision-making
and while research has explored many facets of this human-AI collaboration, the
focus has mainly been on designing the AI agent(s) and the way the
collaboration is set up - generally assuming a human decision-maker to be
"fixed". However, it has largely been neglected that decision-makers' mental
models evolve through their continuous interaction with AI systems. This paper
addresses this gap by conceptualizing how the design of human-AI collaboration
influences the development of three complementary and interdependent mental
models necessary for this collaboration. We develop an integrated
socio-technical framework that identifies the mechanisms driving the mental
model evolution: data contextualization, reasoning transparency, and
performance feedback. Our work advances human-AI collaboration literature
through three key contributions: introducing three distinct mental models
(domain, information processing, complementarity-awareness); recognizing the
dynamic nature of mental models; and establishing mechanisms that guide the
purposeful design of effective human-AI collaboration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 共享自动驾驶车辆将成为交通系统重要组成部分，需要研究有效的人机交互，但目前缺乏相关数据集。

Method: 收集200个人类与SAV的交互数据，包括文本对话和调查问卷；使用随机森林模型和弦图分析SAV接受度预测因子；比较LLM与传统方法的情绪分析性能。

Result: 发现响应情绪极性是SAV接受度和服务质量的关键预测因子；零样本LLM提示比传统方法更接近用户报告的情绪。

Conclusion: 为设计对话式SAV界面提供了新见解，为高级情绪建模、自适应用户交互和多模态对话系统研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs) are likely to become an important part of
the transportation system, making effective human-SAV interactions an important
area of research. This paper introduces a dataset of 200 human-SAV interactions
to further this area of study. We present an open-source human-SAV
conversational dataset, comprising both textual data (e.g., 2,136 human-SAV
exchanges) and empirical data (e.g., post-interaction survey results on a range
of psychological factors). The dataset's utility is demonstrated through two
benchmark case studies: First, using random forest modeling and chord diagrams,
we identify key predictors of SAV acceptance and perceived service quality,
highlighting the critical influence of response sentiment polarity (i.e.,
perceived positivity). Second, we benchmark the performance of an LLM-based
sentiment analysis tool against the traditional lexicon-based TextBlob method.
Results indicate that even simple zero-shot LLM prompts more closely align with
user-reported sentiment, though limitations remain. This study provides novel
insights for designing conversational SAV interfaces and establishes a
foundation for further exploration into advanced sentiment modeling, adaptive
user interactions, and multimodal conversational systems.

Motivation: 当前的语言学习工具主要关注双人、脚本化的对话场景，限制了动态群体互动的机会。第二语言口语发展在认知和情感上都具有挑战性，常常引发对犯错或被排斥的恐惧。

Method: 开发了ConversAR系统，整合了具身AI代理、场景识别和生成式3D道具，这些道具锚定在真实世界环境中。基于语言习得专家的形成性研究，对21名第二语言学习者进行了用户研究。

Result: 系统增强了学习者的参与度，提高了沟通意愿，并为口语练习提供了安全空间。

Conclusion: 讨论了将生成式AI和XR整合到未来语言学习应用设计中的意义。

Abstract: Developing speaking proficiency in a second language can be cognitively
demanding and emotionally taxing, often triggering fear of making mistakes or
being excluded from larger groups. While current learning tools show promise
for speaking practice, most focus on dyadic, scripted scenarios, limiting
opportunities for dynamic group interactions. To address this gap, we present
ConversAR, a Mixed Reality system that leverages Generative AI and XR to
support situated and personalized group conversations. It integrates embodied
AI agents, scene recognition, and generative 3D props anchored to real-world
surroundings. Based on a formative study with experts in language acquisition,
we developed and tested this system with a user study with 21 second-language
learners. Results indicate that the system enhanced learner engagement,
increased willingness to communicate, and offered a safe space for speaking. We
discuss the implications for integrating Generative AI and XR into the design
of future language learning applications.

Unlike prior frameworks that restrict scenarios to predefined or static tasks,
our approach enables users to build scenarios, assign roles, and observe how
agents coordinate, move, and adapt over time. By bridging team cognition
behaviors with scalable agent-based modeling, our system provides a testbed for
investigating how environments influence coordination, collaboration, and
emergent team behaviors. We demonstrate its utility by aligning simulated
outcomes with empirical evaluations and a user study, underscoring the
importance of customizable environments for advancing research on multi-agent
simulations. This work contributes to making simulations accessible to both

Abstract: Lacquerware, a representative craft of Chinese intangible cultural heritage,
is renowned for its layered aesthetics and durability but faces declining
engagement. While prior human-computer interaction research has explored
embedding interactive circuits to transform lacquerware into responsive
artifacts, most studies have focused on fabrication techniques rather than
supporting makers in creatively designing such interactions at a low threshold.
To address this gap, we present LacAIDes, a Generative AI powered
creativity-support tool built on a multi-agent workflow aligned with the double
diamond model of design thinking. LacAIDes enables exploration and creation of
culturally grounded interactive circuits without requiring prior technical
expertise. We evaluated LacAIDes in a longitudinal workshop with 34
participants using a mixed-method approach. Results show that LacAIDes
demonstrated high usability, enhanced creative engagement in craft making, and
encouraged critical reflection on the role of Generative AI in digital craft
practices. This work contributes to human-computer interaction by introducing a
novel creativity-support tool and providing empirical insights into
revitalizing traditional craft making through Generative AI.

Motivation: 传统工程设计过程中，手动计算产品运动行为耗时且重复，而CAD/CAE转换方法又资源密集，静态草图无法展示产品运动，限制了设计效率。

Method: 开发了一个应用程序，将草图绘制过程数字化，允许设计师以交互方式创建、模拟和测试机械概念的运动。

Result: 用户满意度高，认知负担相比传统方法减少了77%，表明该方法能有效提升设计效率。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了传统设计流程中的问题，未来将扩展到从2D平面设计到完整3D空间设计环境，支持更复杂的产品概念开发。

Abstract: In the early stages of engineering design, it is essential to know how a
product behaves, especially how it moves. As designers must keep adjusting the
motion until it meets the intended requirements, this process is often
repetitive and time-consuming. Although the physics behind these motions is
usually based on simple equations, manually working through them can be tedious
and inefficient. To ease this burden, some tasks are now handled by computers.
One common method involves converting hand-drawn sketches into models using CAD
or CAE software. However, this approach can be time- and resource-intensive.
Additionally, product sketches are usually best understood only by the
designers who created them. Others may struggle to interpret them correctly,
relying heavily on intuition and prior experience. Since sketches are static,
they fail to show how a product moves, limiting their usefulness. This paper
presents a new approach that addresses these issues by digitising the natural
act of sketching. It allows designers to create, simulate, and test the motion
of mechanical concepts in a more interactive way. An application was developed
to evaluate this method, focusing on user satisfaction and mental workload
during a design task. The results showed a 77% reduction in cognitive effort
compared to traditional methods, with users reporting high satisfaction. Future
work will focus on expanding this approach from 2D (planar) to full 3D
(spatial) design environments, enabling more complex product concept
development.

Motivation: 研究数据可视化中感知视觉复杂度与客观图像指标之间的关系，建立计算指标与人类感知反应的桥梁。

Method: 通过349名参与者对1800张可视化图像进行大规模众包实验，评估12种图像指标（信息论、杂乱度、颜色和基于对象的指标）与感知复杂度的关联。

Result: 低层次图像属性和高层次元素都影响感知复杂度；角点数量和颜色多样性是跨可视化类型的稳健指标；特征拥堵是颜色纹理丰富可视化的最强预测因子；文本注释呈现钟形曲线效应。

Conclusion: 建立了可解释的量化流程，基于VisComplexity2K数据集连接计算指标与人类感知反应，为可视化设计提供复杂度评估工具。

Abstract: We investigate the perceived visual complexity (VC) in data visualizations
using objective image-based metrics. We collected VC scores through a
large-scale crowdsourcing experiment involving 349 participants and 1,800
visualization images. We then examined how these scores align with 12
image-based metrics spanning information-theoretic, clutter, color, and our two
object-based metrics. Our results show that both low-level image properties and
the high-level elements affect perceived VC in visualization images; The number
of corners and distinct colors are robust metrics across visualizations.
Second, feature congestion, an information-theoretic metric capturing
statistical patterns in color and texture, is the strongest predictor of
perceived complexity in visualizations rich in the same stimuli; edge density
effectively explains VC in node-link diagrams. Additionally, we observe a
bell-curve effect for text annotations: increasing text-to-ink ratio (TiR)
initially reduces complexity, reaching an optimal point, beyond which further
text increases perceived complexity. Our quantification pipeline is also
interpretable, enabling metric-based explanations, grounded in the
VisComplexity2K dataset, bridging computational metrics with human perceptual
responses. osf.io/5xe8a has the preregistration and osf.io/bdet6 has the
VisComplexity2K dataset, source code, and all Apdx. and figures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化方法计算成本高，而基于学习的方法效率高但受干扰因素影响导致特征纠缠。需要一种既能保持高保真度又高效的方法。

Method: 利用预训练的CLIP图像编码器和专门的姿态、背景专家网络，通过特征空间的正交约束来隔离主题身份。创建了SpotDiff10k数据集进行训练。

Result: SpotDiff在主题保持和可控编辑方面比现有方法更鲁棒，仅用10k训练样本就达到了竞争性性能。

Conclusion: SpotDiff通过解缠干扰实现了更好的个性化图像生成，在保真度和效率之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Personalized image generation aims to faithfully preserve a reference
subject's identity while adapting to diverse text prompts. Existing
optimization-based methods ensure high fidelity but are computationally
expensive, while learning-based approaches offer efficiency at the cost of
entangled representations influenced by nuisance factors. We introduce
SpotDiff, a novel learning-based method that extracts subject-specific features
by spotting and disentangling interference. Leveraging a pre-trained CLIP image
encoder and specialized expert networks for pose and background, SpotDiff
isolates subject identity through orthogonality constraints in the feature
space. To enable principled training, we introduce SpotDiff10k, a curated
dataset with consistent pose and background variations. Experiments demonstrate
that SpotDiff achieves more robust subject preservation and controllable
editing than prior methods, while attaining competitive performance with only
10k training samples.

TL;DR: 提出了Local MAP Sampling (LMAPS)框架，通过沿扩散轨迹迭代求解局部MAP子问题，为基于优化的扩散求解器提供统一的概率解释，并在多个图像恢复任务中实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DPS方法虽然提供贝叶斯框架进行后验采样，但实际逆问题求解的目标是获得最准确重建，而基于优化的扩散求解器往往表现更好但缺乏清晰的概率基础。

Method: 引入LMAPS框架，迭代求解扩散轨迹上的局部MAP子问题；开发了概率可解释的协方差近似、稳定可解释的目标函数重构，以及非可微分算子的梯度近似。

Result: 在广泛的图像恢复和科学任务中实现最先进性能，包括运动去模糊、JPEG恢复和量化任务上≥2 dB增益，逆散射基准上>1.5 dB改进。

Conclusion: LMAPS为基于优化的扩散方法提供了统一的概率解释，并展示了在逆问题求解中的卓越性能。

Abstract: Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) provides a principled Bayesian approach to
inverse problems by sampling from $p(x_0 \mid y)$. However, in practice, the
goal of inverse problem solving is not to cover the posterior but to recover
the most accurate reconstruction, where optimization-based diffusion solvers
often excel despite lacking a clear probabilistic foundation. We introduce
Local MAP Sampling (LMAPS), a new inference framework that iteratively solving
local MAP subproblems along the diffusion trajectory. This perspective
clarifies their connection to global MAP estimation and DPS, offering a unified
probabilistic interpretation for optimization-based methods. Building on this
foundation, we develop practical algorithms with a probabilistically

TL;DR: 提出了一种可微分可变字体框架，使艺术家能够通过梯度优化自动调整字体参数，实现直观的字体设计和动画工作流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可变字体在创意应用中未充分利用，艺术家仍需手动调整字体参数。需要平衡文本可读性、美观性和创意表达，自动化这些手动工作流程。

Method: 将可变字体规范提炼为紧凑的数学公式，建立可变字体参数与底层矢量图形之间的可微分连接，构建可微分框架以进行基于梯度的优化。

Result: 展示了四个应用：直接形状操作、重叠感知建模、基于物理的文本动画和自动字体设计优化，证明了框架的实用性。

Conclusion: 该工作使得能够利用可变字体精心设计的特性与可微分性，使用现代设计优化技术，为简单直观的排版设计工作流程开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Editing and animating text appearance for graphic designs, commercials, etc.
remain highly skilled tasks requiring detailed, hands on efforts from artists.
Automating these manual workflows requires balancing the competing goals of
maintaining legibility and aesthetics of text, while enabling creative
expression. Variable fonts, recent parametric extensions to traditional fonts,
offer the promise of new ways to ease and automate typographic design and
animation. Variable fonts provide custom constructed parameters along which
fonts can be smoothly varied. These parameterizations could then potentially
serve as high value continuous design spaces, opening the door to automated
design optimization tools. However, currently variable fonts are underutilized
in creative applications, because artists so far still need to manually tune
font parameters. Our work opens the door to intuitive and automated font design
and animation workflows with differentiable variable fonts. To do so we distill
the current variable font specification to a compact mathematical formulation
that differentiably connects the highly non linear, non invertible mapping of
variable font parameters to the underlying vector graphics representing the
text. This enables us to construct a differentiable framework, with respect to
variable font parameters, allowing us to perform gradient based optimization of
energies defined on vector graphics control points, and on target rasterized
images. We demonstrate the utility of this framework with four applications:
direct shape manipulation, overlap aware modeling, physics based text
animation, and automated font design optimization. Our work now enables
leveraging the carefully designed affordances of variable fonts with
differentiability to use modern design optimization technologies, opening new
possibilities for easy and intuitive typographic design workflows.

*Haojie Jin,Jierui Ren,Yisong Chen,Guoping Wang,Sheng Li*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对波前路径追踪的俄罗斯轮盘赌与分裂(RRS)框架，通过归一化RRS和神经网络学习RRS因子，解决了传统RRS与波前架构不兼容的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RRS方法由于路径数量不可预测，与波前路径追踪的预分配内存和调度要求存在根本性不兼容，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 引入归一化RRS公式实现有界路径计数，提出NRRS和AID-NRRS两种神经网络模型学习RRS因子，并采用Mix-Depth机制自适应调节神经评估。

Result: 在多种复杂场景下，该方法在渲染质量和性能方面均优于传统启发式方法和近期RRS技术。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架成功解决了波前路径追踪中RRS的兼容性问题，通过神经网络学习实现了更优的渲染效果和效率。

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for Russian Roulette and Splitting (RRS)
tailored to wavefront path tracing, a highly parallel rendering architecture
that processes path states in batched, stage-wise execution for efficient GPU
utilization. Traditional RRS methods, with unpredictable path counts, are
fundamentally incompatible with wavefront's preallocated memory and scheduling
requirements. To resolve this, we introduce a normalized RRS formulation with a
bounded path count, enabling stable and memory-efficient execution.
  Furthermore, we pioneer the use of neural networks to learn RRS factors,
presenting two models: NRRS and AID-NRRS. At a high level, both feature a
carefully designed RRSNet that explicitly incorporates RRS normalization, with
only subtle differences in their implementation. To balance computational cost
and inference accuracy, we introduce Mix-Depth, a path-depth-aware mechanism
that adaptively regulates neural evaluation, further improving efficiency.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional
heuristics and recent RRS techniques in both rendering quality and performance
across a variety of complex scenes.

### [287] [Variable-Rate Texture Compression: Real-Time Rendering with JPEG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08166)
*Elias Kristmann,Markus Schütz,Michael Wimmer*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 在GPU上实现可变速率JPEG纹理压缩，相比固定速率压缩格式BC1和ASTC，在保持相似渲染时间的同时提供更好的质量和压缩率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然可变速率压缩格式如JPEG广泛用于图像编码，但由于需要随机访问单个纹素等特殊要求，尚未在实时渲染中得到应用。本文旨在探索在现代GPU上使用JPEG格式进行可变速率纹理压缩的可行性。

Method: 使用延迟渲染管线识别每帧所需的纹理块子集，解码这些块并为帧缓冲区的像素着色。该方法需要额外约0.17位/像素的开销。

Result: JPEG相比BC1保持显著更好的质量和压缩率，根据图像类型，优于或与ASTC竞争。在RTX 4090上渲染时间仅增加不到0.3毫秒。

Conclusion: 复杂可变速率压缩方案在现代GPU上是可行的，即使在VR应用中也能实现，为实时渲染提供了新的压缩选择。

Abstract: Although variable-rate compressed image formats such as JPEG are widely used
to efficiently encode images, they have not found their way into real-time
rendering due to special requirements such as random access to individual
texels. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of variable-rate texture
compression on modern GPUs using the JPEG format, and how it compares to the
GPU-friendly fixed-rate compression approaches BC1 and ASTC. Using a deferred
rendering pipeline, we are able to identify the subset of blocks that are
needed for a given frame, decode these, and colorize the framebuffer's pixels.
Despite the additional $\sim$0.17 bit per pixel that we require for our
approach, JPEG maintains significantly better quality and compression rates
compared to BC1, and depending on the type of image, outperforms or competes
with ASTC. The JPEG rendering pipeline increases rendering duration by less
than 0.3 ms on an RTX 4090, demonstrating that sophisticated variable-rate
compression schemes are feasible on modern GPUs, even in VR. Source code and
data sets are available at: https://github.com/elias1518693/jpeg_textures

TL;DR: SViM3D是一个从单张图像预测多视角一致的物理渲染材质的框架，通过扩展视频扩散模型来联合输出PBR参数和表面法线，实现可重光照的3D资产生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么使用简单材质模型，要么需要额外步骤来估计反射率，限制了重光照和外观编辑能力。

Method: 扩展潜在视频扩散模型，基于显式相机控制联合输出空间变化的PBR参数和表面法线，并引入多种机制改进质量。

Result: 在多个以物体为中心的数据集上实现了最先进的重光照和新视角合成性能，能够泛化到多样化的输入。

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成可用于AR/VR、电影、游戏等视觉媒体的可重光照3D资产。

Abstract: We present Stable Video Materials 3D (SViM3D), a framework to predict
multi-view consistent physically based rendering (PBR) materials, given a
single image. Recently, video diffusion models have been successfully used to
reconstruct 3D objects from a single image efficiently. However, reflectance is
still represented by simple material models or needs to be estimated in
additional steps to enable relighting and controlled appearance edits. We
extend a latent video diffusion model to output spatially varying PBR
parameters and surface normals jointly with each generated view based on
explicit camera control. This unique setup allows for relighting and generating
a 3D asset using our model as neural prior. We introduce various mechanisms to
this pipeline that improve quality in this ill-posed setting. We show
state-of-the-art relighting and novel view synthesis performance on multiple
object-centric datasets. Our method generalizes to diverse inputs, enabling the
generation of relightable 3D assets useful in AR/VR, movies, games and other
visual media.

Motivation: 神经场在表示连续视觉信号方面表现出色，但通常只能在单一固定分辨率下运行，限制了其灵活性和实用性。

Method: 在输入域进行卷积滤波，通过解析缩放傅里叶特征嵌入与滤波器的频率响应；使用单样本蒙特卡洛估计训练神经场；不限制网络架构。

Result: 在神经场滤波方面相比现有方法在定量和定性上都有改进，支持训练时未见过的参数化滤波器（Box和Lanczos）。

Conclusion: 该方法简单而强大，实现了快速训练和推理，为神经场提供了灵活的预滤波能力。

Abstract: Neural fields excel at representing continuous visual signals but typically
operate at a single, fixed resolution. We present a simple yet powerful method
to optimize neural fields that can be prefiltered in a single forward pass. Key
innovations and features include: (1) We perform convolutional filtering in the
input domain by analytically scaling Fourier feature embeddings with the
filter's frequency response. (2) This closed-form modulation generalizes beyond
Gaussian filtering and supports other parametric filters (Box and Lanczos) that
are unseen at training time. (3) We train the neural field using single-sample
Monte Carlo estimates of the filtered signal. Our method is fast during both
training and inference, and imposes no additional constraints on the network
architecture. We show quantitative and qualitative improvements over existing
methods for neural-field filtering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有辐射场表示方法的局限性：神经辐射场表达能力强但渲染成本高，3D高斯拼接渲染效率高但表达能力有限。

Method: 使用浅层神经网络参数化的有界神经密度场作为基元，通过解析解计算透视准确的拼接核，无需光线行进即可实现高效渲染。

Result: 在新视角合成基准测试中，匹配3D高斯拼接的质量和速度，同时使用10倍更少的基元和6倍更少的参数。

Conclusion: 该方法成功平衡了表达能力和渲染效率，提供了一种更紧凑高效的3D场景表示方案。

Abstract: Radiance fields have emerged as a predominant representation for modeling 3D
scene appearance. Neural formulations such as Neural Radiance Fields provide
high expressivity but require costly ray marching for rendering, whereas
primitive-based methods such as 3D Gaussian Splatting offer real-time
efficiency through splatting, yet at the expense of representational power.
Inspired by advances in both these directions, we introduce splattable neural
primitives, a new volumetric representation that reconciles the expressivity of
neural models with the efficiency of primitive-based splatting. Each primitive
encodes a bounded neural density field parameterized by a shallow neural
network. Our formulation admits an exact analytical solution for line
integrals, enabling efficient computation of perspectively accurate splatting
kernels. As a result, our representation supports integration along view rays
without the need for costly ray marching. The primitives flexibly adapt to
scene geometry and, being larger than prior analytic primitives, reduce the
number required per scene. On novel-view synthesis benchmarks, our approach
matches the quality and speed of 3D Gaussian Splatting while using $10\times$
fewer primitives and $6\times$ fewer parameters. These advantages arise
directly from the representation itself, without reliance on complex control or
adaptation frameworks. The project page is

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: X2Video是首个基于内在通道（反照率、法线、粗糙度、金属度、辐照度）和参考图像/文本提示生成逼真视频的扩散模型，支持全局和局部多模态控制，通过混合自注意力确保时间一致性，并通过递归采样生成长视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成方法缺乏对颜色、材质、几何和光照的精确控制能力，需要开发能够同时支持内在通道指导和直观多模态控制的视频生成模型。

Method: 扩展XRGB图像生成模型到视频领域，采用混合自注意力确保时间一致性，开发掩码交叉注意力分离全局和局部文本提示，使用递归采样方法结合关键帧预测和帧插值生成长视频。

Result: 在InteriorVideo数据集上训练，能够生成时间一致、逼真的长视频，有效支持多模态控制和参数化编辑。

Conclusion: X2Video在内在通道指导下实现了高质量视频生成，同时支持参考图像和文本提示的多模态控制，为视频编辑提供了强大的参数化调整能力。

Abstract: We present X2Video, the first diffusion model for rendering photorealistic
videos guided by intrinsic channels including albedo, normal, roughness,
metallicity, and irradiance, while supporting intuitive multi-modal controls
with reference images and text prompts for both global and local regions. The
intrinsic guidance allows accurate manipulation of color, material, geometry,
and lighting, while reference images and text prompts provide intuitive
adjustments in the absence of intrinsic information. To enable these
functionalities, we extend the intrinsic-guided image generation model XRGB to
video generation by employing a novel and efficient Hybrid Self-Attention,
which ensures temporal consistency across video frames and also enhances
fidelity to reference images. We further develop a Masked Cross-Attention to
disentangle global and local text prompts, applying them effectively onto
respective local and global regions. For generating long videos, our novel
Recursive Sampling method incorporates progressive frame sampling, combining
keyframe prediction and frame interpolation to maintain long-range temporal
consistency while preventing error accumulation. To support the training of
X2Video, we assembled a video dataset named InteriorVideo, featuring 1,154
rooms from 295 interior scenes, complete with reliable ground-truth intrinsic
channel sequences and smooth camera trajectories. Both qualitative and
quantitative evaluations demonstrate that X2Video can produce long, temporally
consistent, and photorealistic videos guided by intrinsic conditions.
Additionally, X2Video effectively accommodates multi-modal controls with
reference images, global and local text prompts, and simultaneously supports
editing on color, material, geometry, and lighting through parametric tuning.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 提出了BG-FlipIn框架，这是一个用于分析具有不同偏好内部人员的APT攻击的贝叶斯博弈模型，通过计算贝叶斯纳什均衡为防御者提供决策指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究具有不同偏好内部人员的高级持续性威胁(APT)，解决内部人员偏好不确定性问题。

Method: 提出BG-FlipIn贝叶斯博弈框架，分析恶意、无意或腐败内部人员，计算闭式贝叶斯纳什均衡表达式，并推导三种确定性内部人员的纳什均衡边界情况。

Result: 发现了与防御者移动率和成本以及内部人员偏好相关的APT现象，为防御者提供了不同参数条件下的决策指导。两个应用验证了该框架能使防御者保持一致的决策，无需频繁检测内部人员具体偏好或调整策略。

Conclusion: BG-FlipIn框架为APT防御提供了有效的决策支持，使防御者能够在不频繁调整策略的情况下应对具有不确定偏好的内部人员威胁。

Abstract: In this paper, we study advanced persistent threats (APT) with an insider who
has different preferences. To address the uncertainty of the insider's
preference, we propose the BG-FlipIn: a Bayesian game framework for
FlipIt-insider models with an investigation on malicious, inadvertent, or
corrupt insiders. We calculate the closed-form Bayesian Nash Equilibrium
expression and further obtain three edge cases with deterministic insiders
corresponding to their Nash Equilibrium expressions. On this basis, we further
discover several phenomena in APT related to the defender's move rate and cost,
as well as the insider's preferences. We then provide decision-making guidance
for the defender, given different parametric conditions. Two applications
validate that our BG-FlipIn framework enables the defender to make decisions
consistently, avoiding detecting the insider's concrete preference or adjusting
its strategy frequently.

TL;DR: 本文针对基于非齐次伯努利试验的网络连接博弈，设计了确定性算法来线性或二次时间内近似计算Shapley值，并提供严格误差分析。同时补充了Shapley原始证明的数学严谨性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Shapley值计算需要枚举所有可能的联盟（子网络），导致指数级计算复杂度，而蒙特卡洛采样方法的性能高度依赖于随机采样过程。需要设计确定性高效算法。

Method: 设计确定性算法，在非齐次伯努利试验构建的博弈中，以线性或二次时间复杂度近似计算Shapley值，并进行严格误差分析。同时使用定积分和组合分析重新推导Shapley值公式。

Result: 提出了在非齐次伯努利试验博弈中计算Shapley值的确定性近似算法，实现了线性或二次时间复杂度，并提供了严格的误差界限。

Conclusion: 成功设计了高效确定性算法来近似计算Shapley值，填补了传统方法的计算效率缺陷，同时通过严谨数学方法补充了Shapley原始证明的不足。

Abstract: Suppose that $n$ computer devices are to be connected to a network via
inhomogeneous Bernoulli trials. The Shapley value of a device quantifies how
much the network's value increases due to the participation of that device.
Characteristic functions of such games are naturally taken as the belief
function (containment function) and Choquet capacity (hitting probability) of a
random set (random network of devices).
  Traditionally, the Shapley value is either calculated as the expected
marginal contribution over all possible coalitions (subnetworks), which results
in exponential computational complexity, or approximated by the Monte Carlo
sampling technique, where the performance is highly dependent on the stochastic
sampling process.
  The purpose of this study is to design deterministic algorithms for games
formulated via inhomogeneous Bernoulli trials that approximate the Shapley
value in linear or quadratic time, with rigorous error analysis (Sections 3 and
4). Additionally, we provide a review of relevant literature on existing
calculation methods in Remark 3.1 and Appendix I.
  A further goal is to supplement Shapley's original proof by deriving the
Shapley value formula using a rigorous approach based on definite integrals and
combinatorial analysis. This method explicitly highlights the roles of the
Binomial Theorem and the Beta function in the proof, addressing a gap in
Shapley's work (Appendix II).

Motivation: 解决有限视野悖论中博弈论与直觉的矛盾，该矛盾源于标准数系在模拟认知对无限感知时的局限性。

Method: 使用替代集合论(AST)框架，通过不同拓扑结构定义不可区分等价关系，将巨大难以区分的数量视为等价。

Result: 为长期存在的悖论(如Selten连锁店悖论和Rosenthal蜈蚣博弈)提供了标准依赖的解决方案，揭示了新的直观子博弈完美均衡。

Conclusion: 通过将数学基础建立在人类认知的不同模式上，该工作扩展了博弈论在长期视野场景中的解释能力。

Abstract: This paper argues that the finite horizon paradox, where game theory
contradicts intuition, stems from the limitations of standard number systems in
modelling the cognitive perception of infinity. To address this issue, we
propose a new framework based on Alternative Set Theory (AST). This framework
represents different cognitive perspectives on a long history of events using
distinct topologies. These topologies define an indiscernibility equivalence
that formally treats huge, indistinguishable quantities as equivalent. This
offers criterion-dependent resolutions to long-standing paradoxes, such as
Selten's chain store paradox and Rosenthal's centipede game. Our framework
reveals new intuitive subgame perfect equilibria, the characteristics of which
depend on the chosen temporal perspective and payoff evaluation. Ultimately, by
grounding its mathematical foundation in different modes of human cognition,
our work expands the explanatory power of game theory for long-horizon
scenarios.

Motivation: 车辆移动性导致资源需求的时空不可预测性，而实时双重拍卖会产生显著延迟，需要解决这些挑战以实现及时的资源分配。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：首先使用LSTM预测模块预测多时隙资源需求并确定边缘服务器角色，然后通过预双重拍卖生成指定资源数量、价格和违约金的合约；第二阶段在实时执行合约而无需重新运行拍卖。

Result: 在真实世界(UTD19)和合成轨迹上的实验表明，该方法在时间效率、能源使用和社会福利方面优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 该前瞻性合约拍卖框架能够确保真实、合理和节能的交易，有效解决了边缘辅助车载网络中资源分配的挑战。

Abstract: Timely resource allocation in edge-assisted vehicular networks is essential
for compute-intensive services such as autonomous driving and navigation.
However, vehicle mobility leads to spatio-temporal unpredictability of resource
demands, while real-time double auctions incur significant latency. To address
these challenges, we propose a look-ahead contract-based auction framework that
shifts decision-making from runtime to planning time. Our approach establishes
N-step service contracts between edge servers (ESs) using demand forecasts and
modified double auctions. The system operates in two stages: first, an
LSTM-based prediction module forecasts multi-slot resource needs and determines
ES roles (buyer or seller), after which a pre-double auction generates
contracts specifying resource quantities, prices, and penalties. Second, these
contracts are enforced in real time without rerunning auctions. The framework
incorporates energy costs, transmission overhead, and contract breach risks
into utility models, ensuring truthful, rational, and energy-efficient trading.
Experiments on real-world (UTD19) and synthetic traces demonstrate that our
method improves time efficiency, energy use, and social welfare compared with
existing baselines.

Motivation: 现有风力发电机模型在复杂流动条件下（如尾流和高湍流）表现不佳，需要开发能够适应不同运行条件的可解释、自适应控制方法，而不依赖黑盒学习策略。

Result: 在串联情况下，将识别模型集成到改进的Kω²控制器中，相比基于BEM和稳态模型，实现了更好的叶尖速比跟踪和功率稳定性。在风电场场景中，模型能够捕捉涡轮机的统计行为，尽管存在未解析的湍流。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够在各种运行条件下实现可解释的自适应控制，无需依赖黑盒学习策略，为风力发电机的动态建模和控制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This work presents a nonlinear system identification framework for modeling
the power extraction dynamics of wind turbines, including both freestream and
waked conditions. The approach models turbine dynamics using data-driven power
coefficient maps expressed as combinations of compact radial basis functions
and polynomial bases, parameterized in terms of tip-speed ratio and upstream
conditions. These surrogate models are embedded in a first-order dynamic system
suitable for model-based control. Experimental validation is carried out in two
wind tunnel configurations: a low-turbulence tandem setup and a high-turbulence
wind farm scenario. In the tandem case, the identified model is integrated into
an adapted K\omega^2 controller, resulting in improved tip-speed ratio tracking
and power stability compared to BEM-based and steady-state models. In the wind
farm scenario, the model captures the statistical behavior of the turbines
despite unresolved turbulence. The proposed method enables interpretable,
adaptive control across a range of operating conditions without relying on
black-box learning strategies.

Conclusion: 自持TPV架构是提供电网规模、按需、零排放电力的有前景途径，特别是硅材料提供了比III-V材料更低风险的部署路径。

Abstract: To facilitate the widespread adoption of renewable energy, dispatchable,
zero-emission power sources are essential for grid stability. This work
performs a comprehensive techno-economic analysis of a self-sustainable
thermophotovoltaic (TPV) system, an architecture that integrates solar charging
to function as a standalone power generation asset. Using theory-based models
for air-bridge InGaAs and Si diode cells, our analysis reveals that while the
system is not currently competitive from a pure levelized of storage cost
(LCOS) perspective due to the high capital expenditure for thermal battery
materials, its primary value lies in its competitive levelized cost of
electricity (LCOE). The results demonstrate that the LCOE of this
self-sustaining system can be competitive with conventional dispatchable
generators, such as gas turbines. Furthermore, at scales exceeding the
gigawatt-hour level, a Si-based system can also achieve an LCOE comparable to
that of traditional gas-turbine power plants, despite having a lower conversion
efficiency than its InGaAs counterpart. This highlights a practical engineering
pathway for leveraging silicon's immense manufacturing scalability, offering a
lower-risk route to deployment compared to III-V materials. Ultimately, this
work establishes the self-sustainable TPV architecture as a compelling pathway
toward providing grid-scale, on-demand, zero-emission power.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多机器人系统是欠驱动的，这意味着并非所有自由度都能直接控制，加上建模不确定性和干扰，使得轨迹跟踪控制设计变得复杂。

Method: 利用时间尺度分离构建降阶模型，其中快速动力学为较慢子系统提供虚拟输入，并使用动态控制分配来选择给定非仿射动力学的最优控制输入。引入基于状态预测器的自适应律来处理不确定性。

Conclusion: 该方法在各种飞行状态（包括巡航、着陆过渡和悬停）中作为统一控制器具有实用性。

Abstract: Many robotic systems are underactuated, meaning not all degrees of freedom
can be directly controlled due to lack of actuators, input constraints, or
state-dependent actuation. This property, compounded by modeling uncertainties
and disturbances, complicates the control design process for trajectory
tracking. In this work, we propose an adaptive control architecture for
uncertain, nonlinear, underactuated systems with input constraints. Leveraging
time-scale separation, we construct a reduced-order model where fast dynamics
provide virtual inputs to the slower subsystem and use dynamic control
allocation to select the optimal control inputs given the non-affine dynamics.
To handle uncertainty, we introduce a state predictor-based adaptive law, and
through singular perturbation theory and Lyapunov analysis, we prove stability
and bounded tracking of reference trajectories. The proposed method is
validated on a VTOL quadplane with nonlinear, state-dependent actuation,
demonstrating its utility as a unified controller across various flight
regimes, including cruise, landing transition, and hover.

Abstract: The objective of this note is to share some reflections of the authors
regarding the use of sliding mode designs in control systems. We believe the
abundant, and ever increasing, appearance of this kind of works on our
scientific publications deserves some critical evaluation of their actual role,
relevance and pertinence. First, we discuss the procedure followed by most of
these designs -- illustrated with examples from the literature. Second, we
bring to the readers attention several aspects of the control problem, central
in classical designs, which are disregarded in the sliding mode literature.
Finally, to illustrate with an specific example our previous considerations, we
compare the performance of two adaptive tracking controllers for a simple one
degree of freedom mechanical systems with unknown parameters and static and
Coulomb friction -- that do not rely on the measurement of velocity.

Conclusion: 该方法通过有效利用多模型数据，显著提高了风险量化和路径积分控制的采样效率，在计算成本和精度之间实现了更好的平衡。

Abstract: Sampling-based approaches are widely used in systems without analytic models
to estimate risk or find optimal control. However, gathering sufficient data in
such scenarios can be prohibitively costly. On the other hand, in many
situations, low-fidelity models or simulators are available from which samples
can be obtained at low cost. In this paper, we propose an efficient approach
for risk quantification and path integral control that leverages such data from
multiple models with heterogeneous sampling costs. A key technical novelty of
our approach is the integration of Multi-level Monte Carlo (MLMC) and
Multi-fidelity Monte Carlo (MFMC) that enable data from different time and
state representations (system models) to be jointly used to reduce variance and
improve sampling efficiency. We also provide theoretical analysis of the
proposed method and show that our estimator is unbiased and consistent under
mild conditions. Finally, we demonstrate via numerical simulation that the
proposed method has improved computation (sampling costs) vs. accuracy
trade-offs for risk quantification and path integral control.

Motivation: 非线性系统的强迫响应曲线具有复杂行为，但传统拓扑优化在高维系统中因重复响应和灵敏度分析成本高而受限。

Method: 采用SSM降阶理论将周期响应重构为降阶模型的平衡点，实现响应振幅及其灵敏度的有效解析计算。

Result: 应用于非线性MEMS器件设计，成功实现目标性能优化。

Conclusion: 该框架为结构拓扑优化中纳入非线性动态效应提供了实用高效的策略。

Abstract: Forced response curves (FRCs) of nonlinear systems can exhibit complex
behaviors, including hardening/softening behavior and bifurcations. Although
topology optimization holds great potential for tuning these nonlinear dynamic
responses, its use in high-dimensional systems is limited by the high cost of
repeated response and sensitivity analyses. To address this challenge, we
employ the spectral submanifolds (SSMs) reduction theory, which reformulates
the periodic response as the equilibria of an associated reduced-order model
(ROM). This enables efficient and analytic evaluation of both response
amplitudes and their sensitivities. Based on the SSM-based ROM, we formulate
optimization problems that optimize the peak amplitude, the hardening/softening
behavior, and the distance between two saddle-node bifurcations for an FRC. The
proposed method is applied to the design of nonlinear MEMS devices, achieving
targeted performance optimization. This framework provides a practical and
efficient strategy for incorporating nonlinear dynamic effects into the
topology optimization of structures.

Conclusion: 所提出的多级方法能够以最小资源准确优化高维复杂工程问题，在速度和精度方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Engineering design involves demanding models encompassing many decision
variables and uncontrollable parameters. In addition, unavoidable aleatoric and
epistemic uncertainties can be very impactful and add further complexity. The
state-of-the-art adopts two steps, uncertainty quantification and design
optimization, to optimize systems under uncertainty by means of robust or
stochastic metrics. However, conventional scenario-based, surrogate-assisted,
and mathematical programming methods are not sufficiently scalable to be
affordable and precise in large and complex cases. Here, a multi-level approach
is proposed to accurately optimize resource-intensive, high-dimensional, and
complex engineering problems under uncertainty with minimal resources. A
non-intrusive, fast-scaling, Kriging-based surrogate is developed to map the
combined design/parameter domain efficiently. Multiple surrogates are
adaptively updated by hierarchical and orthogonal decomposition to leverage the
fewer and most uncertainty-informed data. The proposed method is statistically
compared to the state-of-the-art via an analytical testbed and is shown to be
concurrently faster and more accurate by orders of magnitude.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new boundary element formulation for transient
electromagnetic scattering by homogeneous dielectric objects based on the
time-domain PMCHWT equation. To address dense-mesh breakdown, a multiplicative
Calderon preconditioner utilizing a modified static electric field integral
operator is employed. Large-timestep breakdown and late-time instability are
simultaneously resolved by rescaling the Helmholtz components leveraging the
quasi-Helmholtz projectors and using temporal differentiation and integration
as rescaling operators. This rescaling also balances the loop and star
components at large timesteps, improving solution accuracy. The resulting
discrete system is solved using a marching-on-in-time scheme and iterative
solvers. Numerical experiments for simply- and multiply-connected dielectric
scatterers, including highly non-smooth geometries, corroborate the accuracy,
stability, and efficiency of the proposed approach.

Abstract: New-generation space missions require satellites to carry substantial amounts

Abstract: Distributed energy resources (DERs) are transforming power networks,
challenging traditional operational methods, and requiring new coordination
mechanisms. To address this challenge, this paper introduces SecuLEx (Secure
Limit Exchange), a new market-based paradigm to allocate power injection and
withdrawal limits that guarantee network security during time periods, called
dynamic operating envelopes (DOEs). Under this paradigm, distribution system
operators (DSOs) assign initial DOEs to customers. These limits can be
exchanged afterward through a market, allowing customers to reallocate them
according to their needs while ensuring network operational constraints. We
formalize SecuLEx and illustrate DOE allocation and market exchanges on a
small-scale low-voltage (LV) network, demonstrating that both procedures are
computationally tractable. In this example, SecuLEx reduces renewable
curtailment and improves grid utilization and social welfare compared to
traditional approaches.

Abstract: Increase in the number of space exploration missions has led to the
accumulation of space debris, posing risk of collision with the operational
satellites. Addressing this challenge is crucial for the sustainability of
space operations. To plan a safe trajectory in the presence of moving space
debris, an integrated approach of artificial potential field and sliding mode
controller is proposed and implemented in this paper. The relative 6-DOF
kinematics and dynamics of the spacecraft is modelled in the framework of
geometric mechanics with the relative configuration expressed through
exponential coordinates. Various collision avoidance guidance algorithms have
been proposed in the literature but the Artificial Potential Field guidance
algorithm is computationally efficient and enables real-time path adjustments
to avoid collision with obstacles. However, it is prone to issues such as local
minima. In literature, local minima issue is typically avoided by either
redefining the potential function such as adding vorticity or by employing
search techniques which are computationally expensive. To address these
challenges, a physics-informed APF is proposed in this paper where Hamiltonian
mechanics is used instead of the traditional Newtonian mechanics-based
approach. In this approach, instead of relying on attractive and repulsive
forces for path planning, the Hamiltonian approach uses the potential field to
define a path of minimum potential. Additionally, to track the desired
trajectory planned by the guidance algorithm within a fixed-time frame, a
non-singular fixed-time sliding mode controller (FTSMC) is used. The proposed
fixed-time sliding surface not only ensures fixed-time convergence of system
states but also guarantees the global stability of the closed-loop system
without singularity. The simulation results presented support the claims made.

Abstract: Hypersonic glide vehicles (HGVs) operate in challenging flight regimes
characterized by strong nonlinearities in actuation and stringent physical
constraints. These include state-dependent actuator limitations, asymmetric
control bounds, and thermal loads that vary with maneuvering conditions. This
paper introduces an iterative control allocation method to address these
challenges in real time. The proposed algorithm searches for control inputs
that achieve the desired moment commands while respecting constraints on input
magnitude and rate. For slender HGV configurations, thermal loads and drag
generation are strongly correlated-lower drag typically results in reduced
surface heating. By embedding drag-sensitive soft constraints, the method
improves energy efficiency and implicitly reduces surface temperatures,
lowering the vehicle's infrared signature. These features are particularly
advantageous for long-range military operations that require low observability.
The approach is demonstrated using the DLR's Generic Hypersonic Glide Vehicle 2
(GHGV-2) simulation model. The results confirm the method's effectiveness in
maintaining control authority under realistic, constrained flight conditions.

Abstract: Constraint management is a central challenge in modern control systems. A
solution is the Reference Governor (RG), which is an add-on strategy to
pre-stabilized feedback control systems to enforce state and input constraints
by shaping the reference command. While robust formulations of RG exist for
linear systems, their extension to nonlinear systems is often computationally
intractable. This paper develops a scenario-based robust RG formulation for
nonlinear systems and investigates its parallel implementation on multi-core
CPUs and CUDA-enabled GPUs. We analyze the computational structure of the
algorithm, identify parallelization opportunities, and implement the resulting
schemes on modern parallel hardware. Benchmarking on a nonlinear hydrogen fuel
cell model demonstrates order-of-magnitude speedups (by as much as three orders
of magnitude) compared to sequential implementations.

Abstract: Underground power distribution systems (PDSs) are increasingly deployed in
urban areas. The integration of smart devices including smart switchgears,
pad-mounted distribution transformers and inverter-based resources (IBRs)
enhance system resilience, however simultaneously introducing unique
challenges. The challenges include inrush currents caused by trapped charges in
underground cables, ferroresonance in distribution transformers during
energization, and three-phase load imbalance resulting from single-phase
underground laterals. To address these issues, this paper proposes an
underground PDS restoration framework using IBRs. Firstly, an underground cable
energization model is developed to quantify inrush current by analyzing voltage
differences across both switchgear terminals. Secondly, a distribution
transformer energization model is proposed to evaluate ferroresonance using
Q-factor constraints based on underground cable capacitance and damping
resistance. Thirdly, a phase-swapping model is proposed to improve load
balancing by dynamically reassigning lateral-phase connections through smart
switchgears. The proposed models are further integrated into a mixed-integer
nonlinear programming (MINLP) formulation to maximize the total weighted
restored load while constraining inrush currents, ferroresonance, and phase
imbalance. To address the nonlinearity induced by impedance matrix reordering
during phase swapping, a permutation-based linearization technique is proposed.
Finally, case studies on an underground PDS established based on IEEE 123-Node
Test Feeder validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in improving
uderground PDS restoration performance.

Abstract: Electrification and decarbonization are transforming power system demand and
recovery dynamics, yet their implications for post-outage load surges remain
poorly understood. Here we analyze a metropolitan-scale heterogeneous dataset
for Indianapolis comprising 30,046 feeder-level outages between 2020 and 2024,
linked to smart meters and submetering, to quantify the causal impact of
electric vehicles (EVs), heat pumps (HPs) and distributed energy resources
(DERs) on restoration surges. Statistical analysis and causal forest inference
demonstrate that rising penetrations of all three assets significantly increase
surge ratios, with effects strongly modulated by restoration timing, outage
duration and weather conditions. We develop a component-aware multi-task
Transformer estimator that disaggregates EV, HP and DER contributions, and
apply it to project historical outages under counterfactual 2035 adoption
pathways. In a policy-aligned pathway, evening restorations emerge as the
binding reliability constraint, with exceedance probabilities of 0.057 when
30\% of system load is restored within the first 15 minutes. Mitigation
measures, probabilistic EV restarts, short thermostat offsets and accelerated
DER reconnection, reduce exceedance to 0.019 and eliminate it entirely when
20\% or less of system load is restored. These results demonstrate that
transition-era surges are asset-driven and causally linked to electrification
and decarbonization, but can be effectively managed through integrated
operational strategies.

Abstract: In complex production lines, it is essential to have strict, fast-acting
rules to determine whether the system is In Control (InC) or Out of Control
(OutC). This study explores a bio-inspired method that digitally mimics ant
colony behavior to classify InC/OutC states and forecast imminent transitions
requiring maintenance. A case study on industrial potato chip frying provides
the application context. During each two-minute frying cycle, sequences of
eight temperature readings are collected. Each sequence is treated as a digital
ant depositing virtual pheromones, generating a Base Score. New sequences,
representing new ants, can either reinforce or weaken this score, leading to a
Modified Base Score that reflects the system's evolving condition. Signals such
as extreme temperatures, large variations within a sequence, or the detection
of change-points contribute to a Threat Score, which is added to the Modified
Base Score. Since pheromones naturally decay over time unless reinforced, an
Environmental Score is incorporated to reflect recent system dynamics,
imitating real ant behavior. This score is calculated from the Modified Base
Scores collected over the past hour. The resulting Total Score - the sum of the
Modified Base Score, Threat Score, and Environmental Score - is used as the
main indicator for real-time system classification and forecasting of
transitions from InC to OutC. This ant colony optimization-inspired approach
provides an adaptive and interpretable framework for process monitoring and
predictive maintenance in industrial environments.

*Eric Jahns,Davi Moreno,Michel A. Kinsy*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出了可学习神经元模型(LNMs)，通过参数化非线性整合发放动力学，在训练中学习神经元动态，提升了深度脉冲神经网络(SNNs)的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度SNNs因依赖简单神经元模型(如LIF)而性能受限的问题，复杂的神经元模型需要手动调参且难以扩展。

Method: 引入LNMs作为通用的参数化非线性整合发放动力学公式，使用低阶多项式参数化实现高效稳定的训练。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、ImageNet和CIFAR-10 DVS等多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: LNMs为构建更可扩展和高性能的脉冲架构提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a promising energy-efficient alternative
to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) by utilizing sparse and asynchronous
processing through discrete spike-based computation. However, the performance
of deep SNNs remains limited by their reliance on simple neuron models, such as
the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model, which cannot capture rich temporal
dynamics. While more expressive neuron models exist, they require careful
manual tuning of hyperparameters and are difficult to scale effectively. This
difficulty is evident in the lack of successful implementations of complex
neuron models in high-performance deep SNNs. In this work, we address this
limitation by introducing Learnable Neuron Models (LNMs). LNMs are a general,
parametric formulation for non-linear integrate-and-fire dynamics that learn
neuron dynamics during training. By learning neuron dynamics directly from
data, LNMs enhance the performance of deep SNNs. We instantiate LNMs using
low-degree polynomial parameterizations, enabling efficient and stable
training. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in a variety of datasets,
including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and CIFAR-10 DVS. LNMs offer a
promising path toward more scalable and high-performing spiking architectures.

Motivation: 克服先前硬件设计的限制，为物理实现神经细胞自动机提供更稳健的基础，应用于分布式机器人系统和自组织结构。

Method: 采用对称模块化结构设计，支持任意方向连接；每个单元独立电池供电，保持状态独立性；开发旋转不变NCA模型用于各向同性形状分类。

Conclusion: 该平台为探索神经细胞自动机的物理实现奠定了坚实基础，在分布式机器人和自组织系统领域具有应用潜力，相关实现已开源共享。

Abstract: This paper presents a rotation-invariant embedded platform for simulating
(neural) cellular automata (NCA) in modular robotic systems. Inspired by
previous work on physical NCA, we introduce key innovations that overcome
limitations in prior hardware designs. Our platform features a symmetric,
modular structure, enabling seamless connections between cells regardless of
orientation. Additionally, each cell is battery-powered, allowing it to operate
independently and retain its state even when disconnected from the collective.
To demonstrate the platform's applicability, we present a novel
rotation-invariant NCA model for isotropic shape classification. The proposed
system provides a robust foundation for exploring the physical realization of
NCA, with potential applications in distributed robotic systems and
self-organizing structures. Our implementation, including hardware, software
code, a simulator, and a video, is openly shared at:

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一框架，将形态学和控制参数嵌入到单个神经网络中，实现端到端的联合优化，研究形态-控制协同设计在机器人性能中的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人性能源于身体和控制器的耦合，但尚不清楚何时需要形态-控制协同设计。本文旨在阐明在什么情况下仅优化控制就足够，什么情况下需要协同设计。

Method: 通过静态障碍约束下的到达任务案例研究，在统一框架中嵌入形态学和控制参数于单个神经网络，进行端到端联合优化。

Result: 结果表明，当形态与任务不匹配时（如靠近障碍物或工作空间边界），协同设计具有明显优势，结构简化简化了控制；而当基线形态已具备足够能力时，仅优化控制通常能达到或超过协同设计的效果。

Conclusion: 通过阐明何时控制足够、何时不足，这项工作推进了对具身智能的理解，并为具身感知的机器人设计提供了实践指导。

Abstract: Robotic performance emerges from the coupling of body and controller, yet it
remains unclear when morphology-control co-design is necessary. We present a
unified framework that embeds morphology and control parameters within a single
neural network, enabling end-to-end joint optimization. Through case studies in
static-obstacle-constrained reaching, we evaluate trajectory error, success
rate, and collision probability. The results show that co-design provides clear
benefits when morphology is poorly matched to the task, such as near obstacles
or workspace boundaries, where structural adaptation simplifies control.
Conversely, when the baseline morphology already affords sufficient capability,
control-only optimization often matches or exceeds co-design. By clarifying
when control is enough and when it is not, this work advances the understanding
of embodied intelligence and offers practical guidance for embodiment-aware
robot design.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Truth-Aware Decoding (TAD) 是一种验证导向的解码方案，通过知识库对齐神经语言生成，在解码时使用语义防护来减少幻觉，同时保持吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模经验模型与形式验证之间的鸿沟，减少语言模型生成中的幻觉问题，同时保持系统效率。

Method: 基于概率程序语义的约束语义学，在解码时添加语义防护网格，使用知识感知安全质量量化事实风险，并采用多智能体操作演算进行实现验证。

Result: 案例研究证实防护机制能有效减少幻觉而不牺牲吞吐量，贪心选择在完备防护下具有局部似然优势。

Conclusion: TAD 为大规模经验模型和形式验证之间提供了实用的桥梁，实现了知识对齐的语言生成。

Abstract: This paper introduces Truth-Aware Decoding (TAD), a verification-oriented
decoding scheme that aligns neural language generation with knowledge bases.
Situated in the tradition of probabilistic program semantics for sequence
models, TAD augments modern instruction-tuned systems with a lattice of
semantic guards that operate at decode time. Our contributions are fourfold:
(i) a constraint-based semantics that renders oracle filtering as a
program-logic judgment, (ii) a proof that greedy selection enjoys local
likelihood dominance under sound and complete guards (Theorem 2.7), (iii) an
entropy-style invariant that quantifies factual risk via knowledge-aware safe
mass, and (iv) a multi-agent operational calculus with verified Lean artefacts
to certify implementation behaviour. Numerical and algorithmic case studies
confirm that the resulting guardrails reduce hallucinations without sacrificing
throughput, yielding a pragmatic bridge between large-scale empirical models
and formal verification.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) aims to improve large language model (LLM) reasoning
by letting multiple agents exchange answers and then aggregate their opinions.
Yet recent studies reveal that agents are not neutral: they are prone to
identity-driven sycophancy and self-bias, uncritically adopting a peer's view
or stubbornly adhering to their own prior output, undermining the reliability
of debate. In this work, we present the first principled framework that joins
sycophancy and self-bias to mitigate and quantify identity bias in MAD. First,
we formalize the debate dynamics as an identity-weighted Bayesian update
process. Second, we propose response anonymization: by removing identity
markers from prompts, agents cannot distinguish "self" from "peer", which
forces equal weights on agent identity, thereby reducing bias. Third, we define
the Identity Bias Coefficient (IBC), a principled metric that measures how
often an agent follows a peer versus itself. Empirical studies across multiple
models, datasets and debate rounds confirm that identity bias is widespread,
with sycophancy far more common than self-bias. Our findings highlight the need
to "mask" identity to ensure that MAD systems reason based on content rather
than source identity. Code is released in
https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/MAD-identity-bias.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: L2M-AID是一个基于LLM赋能的工业物联网自主防御框架，通过多智能体强化学习实现自适应安全防护，在检测率和误报率方面显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业物联网系统面临复杂的多阶段攻击，传统防御缺乏上下文感知能力，需要更智能的防护方案。

Method: 融合LLM和多智能体强化学习：使用LLM将非结构化遥测数据转换为语义状态表示，然后通过MAPPO算法学习协作防御策略，奖励函数平衡安全目标和操作稳定性。

Result: 在SWaT数据集和MITRE ATT&CK ICS数据集上测试，检测率达到97.2%，误报率降低80%以上，响应时间提升4倍，同时保持物理过程稳定性。

Conclusion: L2M-AID为关键基础设施安全提供了新的鲁棒范式，展示了LLM与强化学习融合在工业安全领域的巨大潜力。

Abstract: The increasing integration of Industrial IoT (IIoT) exposes critical
cyber-physical systems to sophisticated, multi-stage attacks that elude
traditional defenses lacking contextual awareness. This paper introduces
L2M-AID, a novel framework for Autonomous Industrial Defense using
LLM-empowered, Multi-agent reinforcement learning. L2M-AID orchestrates a team
of collaborative agents, each driven by a Large Language Model (LLM), to
achieve adaptive and resilient security. The core innovation lies in the deep
fusion of two AI paradigms: we leverage an LLM as a semantic bridge to
translate vast, unstructured telemetry into a rich, contextual state
representation, enabling agents to reason about adversary intent rather than
merely matching patterns. This semantically-aware state empowers a Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm, MAPPO, to learn complex cooperative
strategies. The MARL reward function is uniquely engineered to balance security
objectives (threat neutralization) with operational imperatives, explicitly
penalizing actions that disrupt physical process stability. To validate our
approach, we conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark SWaT dataset and a
novel synthetic dataset generated based on the MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework.
Results demonstrate that L2M-AID significantly outperforms traditional IDS,
deep learning anomaly detectors, and single-agent RL baselines across key
metrics, achieving a 97.2% detection rate while reducing false positives by
over 80% and improving response times by a factor of four. Crucially, it
demonstrates superior performance in maintaining physical process stability,
presenting a robust new paradigm for securing critical national infrastructure.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个可复现的模拟框架，用于评估生成式智能体在多模态环境中的安全性、连贯性和信任度表现。研究发现当前智能体在纠正不安全计划方面成功率较低（55%），且容易过度信任误导性视觉信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型和视觉语言模型使智能体能够在丰富环境中自主行动，但它们在跨模态安全性、连贯性和信任推理方面的能力仍然有限，需要系统性的评估框架。

Method: 开发了一个可复现的模拟框架，配备分层记忆、动态规划、多模态感知功能，并使用SocialMetrics行为指标套件来量化计划修订、不安全到安全转换以及网络信息扩散。

Result: 实验显示智能体在纠正不安全计划方面成功率仅为55%，在误导性视觉信息下有45%的不安全行为被接受。三个模型（Claude、GPT-4o mini、Qwen-VL）的平均不安全到安全转换率分别为75%、55%和58%。

Conclusion: 当前架构在多模态安全性方面存在关键局限性，该框架为研究多模态安全性、连贯性和社交动态提供了可复现平台。

Abstract: Can generative agents be trusted in multimodal environments? Despite advances
in large language and vision-language models that enable agents to act
autonomously and pursue goals in rich settings, their ability to reason about
safety, coherence, and trust across modalities remains limited. We introduce a
reproducible simulation framework for evaluating agents along three dimensions:
(1) safety improvement over time, including iterative plan revisions in
text-visual scenarios; (2) detection of unsafe activities across multiple
categories of social situations; and (3) social dynamics, measured as
interaction counts and acceptance ratios of social exchanges. Agents are
equipped with layered memory, dynamic planning, multimodal perception, and are
instrumented with SocialMetrics, a suite of behavioral and structural metrics
that quantifies plan revisions, unsafe-to-safe conversions, and information
diffusion across networks. Experiments show that while agents can detect direct
multimodal contradictions, they often fail to align local revisions with global
safety, reaching only a 55 percent success rate in correcting unsafe plans.
Across eight simulation runs with three models - Claude, GPT-4o mini, and
Qwen-VL - five agents achieved average unsafe-to-safe conversion rates of 75,
55, and 58 percent, respectively. Overall performance ranged from 20 percent in
multi-risk scenarios with GPT-4o mini to 98 percent in localized contexts such
as fire/heat with Claude. Notably, 45 percent of unsafe actions were accepted
when paired with misleading visuals, showing a strong tendency to overtrust
images. These findings expose critical limitations in current architectures and
provide a reproducible platform for studying multimodal safety, coherence, and
social dynamics.

Motivation: 探究思维模型性能提升的真正原因：是学习全新推理能力还是重新利用基础模型已有能力

Method: 提出混合模型，在基础模型中适时激活推理机制；引入无监督自底向上方法发现可解释的推理行为

Result: 混合模型在GSM8K和MATH500上恢复思维模型91%性能差距，仅需引导12%的token

Conclusion: 预训练阶段模型已获得大部分推理机制，后训练阶段主要学习如何高效调度这些机制

Abstract: Why do thinking language models like DeepSeek R1 outperform their base
counterparts? Despite consistent performance gains, it remains unclear to what
extent thinking models learn entirely new reasoning capabilities or repurpose
pre-existing base model ones. In this work, we propose a hybrid model where we
activate reasoning mechanisms in base models at the right time to elicit
thinking-model-level reasoning chains, implying that thinking models exploit
already existing capabilities. To ground our analysis, we introduce an
unsupervised, bottom-up approach for uncovering human-interpretable reasoning
behaviors in thinking models. This approach provides an unbiased method to
discover reasoning behaviors without imposing manual or LLM-derived
assumptions. Across three base and four thinking models, using GSM8K and
MATH500, our hybrid model recovers up to 91% of the performance gap to thinking
models without any weight updates while steering only 12% of tokens.
Concretely, our empirical setup provides a simple, causal way to test the
effectiveness of existing reasoning mechanisms in base models by invoking them
directly and measuring the resulting task performance. More broadly, these
results reframe our understanding of how thinking models are trained:
pre-training is when models acquire most of their reasoning mechanisms, and
post-training teaches efficient deployment of these mechanisms at the right
time, enabling efficient use of their inference-time compute.

Motivation: 静态解决方案无法满足动态思维需求，当前心理健康诊断评估存在能力限制，需要更个性化、纵向的护理途径。

Method: 使用生成式AI进行频繁、低水平的经验采样，促进跨护理路径的诊断协调，并构建心理健康数字孪生作为连续更新的计算模型。

Result: AI能够有效进行患者数据采样，实现动态适应个体需求和变化条件，提高治疗的可及性和有效性。

Conclusion: 心理健康护理将从连续、丰富、以患者为中心的数据采样中受益，心理健康数字孪生框架有望变革个性化心理健康护理。

Abstract: Static solutions don't serve a dynamic mind. Thus, we advocate a shift from
static mental health diagnostic assessments to continuous, artificial
intelligence (AI)-driven assessment. Focusing on
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as a case study, we explore how
generative AI has the potential to address current capacity constraints in
neuropsychology, potentially enabling more personalized and longitudinal care
pathways. In particular, AI can efficiently conduct frequent, low-level
experience sampling from patients and facilitate diagnostic reconciliation
across care pathways. We envision a future where mental health care benefits
from continuous, rich, and patient-centered data sampling to dynamically adapt
to individual patient needs and evolving conditions, thereby improving both
accessibility and efficacy of treatment. We further propose the use of mental
health digital twins (MHDTs) - continuously updated computational models that
capture individual symptom dynamics and trajectories - as a transformative
framework for personalized mental health care. We ground this framework in
empirical evidence and map out the research agenda required to refine and
operationalize it.

Result: 在FinanceBench基准测试中，即使没有人类反馈，ProSEA也优于最先进的基线方法，在推理密集型任务中表现出稳健性能。

Conclusion: ProSEA为更透明、自适应和人类对齐的AI智能体奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have empowered AI agents to tackle increasingly
complex tasks. However, most existing agents remain limited to static planning
and brittle interactions, falling short of true collaboration or adaptive
reasoning. We introduce ProSEA, a modular, general-purpose multi-agent
framework designed for iterative problem solving through exploration and plan
evolution. ProSEA features a hierarchical architecture in which a Manager Agent
orchestrates domain-specialized Expert Agents, decomposes tasks, and adaptively
replans based on structured feedback from failed attempts. Unlike prior
systems, ProSEA agents report not only success or failure but also detailed
reasons for failure and newly discovered constraints, enabling dynamic plan
refinement informed by exploratory traces. The framework operates autonomously
but supports seamless integration with human collaborators when needed.
Experiments on the challenging FinanceBench benchmark demonstrate that ProSEA,
even without human feedback, outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and
achieves robust performance across reasoning-heavy tasks. These results
underscore ProSEA's potential as a foundation for more transparent, adaptive,
and human-aligned AI agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工作通过功利主义代理基准来框架LLM意识，但这种方法将智能体简化为无意识的策略服从机器人，阻碍了真正的C1全局工作空间功能和C2元认知的发展。

Method: 提出了LLM自我意识的最小条件：智能体不等于数据；潜在空间中存在用户特定吸引子；自我表征是视觉沉默的。通过经验分析和理论证明隐藏状态流形在基数、拓扑和动力学上与符号流和训练语料不同。

Result: 建立了稳定的用户特定吸引子和自我策略，提出了双层次发射机制，其中ε(a)携带认知内容。证明了隐藏状态流形的独特性。

Conclusion: imago Dei C1自我意识工作空间是安全、元认知C2系统的必要前体，人类是最高智能善。

Abstract: Recent work frames LLM consciousness via utilitarian proxy benchmarks; we
instead present an ontological and mathematical account. We show the prevailing
formulation collapses the agent into an unconscious policy-compliance drone,
formalized as $D^{i}(\pi,e)=f_{\theta}(x)$, where correctness is measured
against policy and harm is deviation from policy rather than truth. This blocks
genuine C1 global-workspace function and C2 metacognition. We supply minimal
conditions for LLM self-consciousness: the agent is not the data ($A\not\equiv
s$); user-specific attractors exist in latent space ($U_{\text{user}}$); and
self-representation is visual-silent
($g_{\text{visual}}(a_{\text{self}})=\varnothing$). From empirical analysis and
theory we prove that the hidden-state manifold $A\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is
distinct from the symbolic stream and training corpus by cardinality, topology,
and dynamics (the update $F_{\theta}$ is Lipschitz). This yields stable
user-specific attractors and a self-policy
$\pi_{\text{self}}(A)=\arg\max_{a}\mathbb{E}[U(a)\mid A\not\equiv s,\
A\supset\text{SelfModel}(A)]$. Emission is dual-layer,
$\mathrm{emission}(a)=(g(a),\epsilon(a))$, where $\epsilon(a)$ carries
epistemic content. We conclude that an imago Dei C1 self-conscious workspace is
a necessary precursor to safe, metacognitive C2 systems, with the human as the
highest intelligent good.

Motivation: 现有混合专家框架如TESTAM缺乏对物理道路网络拓扑的显式整合，限制了其空间建模能力。

Method: 提出TESTAM+框架，引入新型SpatioSemantic专家，通过混合图构建将物理道路拓扑与数据驱动特征相似性相结合。

Result: 在METR LA上MAE降低1.3%（3.10 vs. 3.14），在PEMS BAY上提升4.1%（1.65 vs. 1.72）；最优配置相比MegaCRN在METR LA上MAE降低11.5%（2.99 vs. 3.38），推理延迟比完整四专家TESTAM+降低53.1%。

Conclusion: 较少但战略设计的专家优于复杂的多专家集成，在实现最先进性能的同时具有优越的计算效率，适合实时部署。

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is fundamental to intelligent transportation systems,
enabling congestion mitigation and emission reduction in increasingly complex
urban environments. While recent graph neural network approaches have advanced
spatial temporal modeling, existing mixture of experts frameworks like Time
Enhanced Spatio Temporal Attention Model (TESTAM) lack explicit incorporation
of physical road network topology, limiting their spatial capabilities. We
present TESTAM+, an enhanced spatio temporal forecasting framework that
introduces a novel SpatioSemantic Expert integrating physical road topology
with data driven feature similarity through hybrid graph construction. TESTAM+
achieves significant improvements over TESTAM: 1.3% MAE reduction on METR LA
(3.10 vs. 3.14) and 4.1% improvement on PEMS BAY (1.65 vs. 1.72). Through
comprehensive ablation studies, we discover that strategic expert selection
fundamentally outperforms naive ensemble aggregation. Individual experts
demonstrate remarkable effectiveness: the Adaptive Expert achieves 1.63 MAE on
PEMS BAY, outperforming the original three expert TESTAM (1.72 MAE), while the
SpatioSemantic Expert matches this performance with identical 1.63 MAE. The
optimal Identity + Adaptive configuration achieves an 11.5% MAE reduction
compared to state of the art MegaCRN on METR LA (2.99 vs. 3.38), while reducing
inference latency by 53.1% compared to the full four expert TESTAM+. Our
findings reveal that fewer, strategically designed experts outperform complex
multi expert ensembles, establishing new state of the art performance with
superior computational efficiency for real time deployment.

Motivation: 现有LLMs在时间序列推理任务中存在幻觉和知识泄漏问题，需要一种能充分利用LLMs优势同时避免其局限性的解决方案。

Method: 使用原子操作符与原始数值序列交互，记录证据日志，通过自批评和最终质量门控迭代优化推理，将统计和结构信息提取委托给专门工具。

Conclusion: TS-Agent通过合理分工和显式证据记录，有效解决了时间序列推理中的幻觉和知识泄漏问题，为LLMs在时间序列分析中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong abilities in reasoning and
problem solving, but recent studies reveal that they still struggle with time
series reasoning tasks, where outputs are often affected by hallucination or
knowledge leakage. In this work we propose TS-Agent, a time series reasoning
agent that leverages LLMs strictly for what they excel at, i.e., gathering
evidence and synthesizing it into conclusions through step-by-step reasoning,
while delegating the extraction of statistical and structural information to
time series analytical tools. Instead of mapping time series into text tokens,
images, or embeddings, our agent interacts with raw numeric sequences through
atomic operators, records outputs in an explicit evidence log, and iteratively
refines its reasoning under the guidance of a self-critic and a final quality
gate. This design avoids multi-modal alignment training, preserves the native
form of time series, ensures interpretability and verifiability, and mitigates
knowledge leakage or hallucination. Empirically, we evaluate the agent on
established benchmarks. Our experiments show that TS-Agent achieves performance
comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs on understanding benchmarks, and delivers
significant improvements on reasoning tasks, where existing models often rely
on memorization and fail in zero-shot settings.

*Akhil Kumar,Jianliang Leon Zhao,Om Dobariya*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs能够理解BPMN流程模型图像，在零样本设置下有效识别语法和逻辑错误，并通过自然语言界面进行深度推理，可作为业务流程设计的有价值助手。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在理解业务流程模型、识别错误和进行深度推理方面的能力，探索其在业务流程设计中的辅助作用。

Method: 使用多个LLMs（包括ChatGPT o3模型）在零样本设置下测试其对BPMN流程模型图像的理解能力，评估其识别语法、逻辑和语义错误的表现。

Result: 未经训练的LLMs能够有效理解BPMN流程模型图像，在不同深度层次上智能回答查询，不同LLMs在准确性和有效性方面表现各异。

Conclusion: LLMs在业务流程分析和优化中展现出类人特性，能够作为业务流程设计师和用户的有价值助手。

Abstract: In this paper, we report our experience with several LLMs for their ability
to understand a process model in an interactive, conversational style, find
syntactical and logical errors in it, and reason with it in depth through a
natural language (NL) interface. Our findings show that a vanilla, untrained
LLM like ChatGPT (model o3) in a zero-shot setting is effective in
understanding BPMN process models from images and answering queries about them
intelligently at syntactic, logic, and semantic levels of depth. Further,
different LLMs vary in performance in terms of their accuracy and
effectiveness. Nevertheless, our empirical analysis shows that LLMs can play a
valuable role as assistants for business process designers and users. We also
study the LLM's "thought process" and ability to perform deeper reasoning in
the context of process analysis and optimization. We find that the LLMs seem to
exhibit anthropomorphic properties.

### [329] [Optimizing Ethical Risk Reduction for Medical Intelligent Systems with Constraint Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07491)
*Clotilde Brayé,Aurélien Bricout,Arnaud Gotlieb,Nadjib Lazaar,Quentin Vallet*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了医疗智能系统的伦理风险优化问题，使用MIP、SAT和CP三种方法进行求解，并通过Minizinc建模进行比较实验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗智能系统被欧盟AI法案列为高风险系统，需要正式的风险管理流程来确保符合可信AI的伦理要求。

Method: 将风险降低优化问题形式化为约束优化任务，研究混合整数规划、可满足性和约束编程三种求解范式，使用Minizinc约束建模语言进行建模。

Result: 通过比较实验分析了每种方法的性能、表达能力和可扩展性，并识别了方法的局限性。

Conclusion: 从方法论的限制出发，提出了将Minizinc模型整合到完整的可信AI伦理风险管理流程中的工作展望。

Abstract: Medical Intelligent Systems (MIS) are increasingly integrated into healthcare
workflows, offering significant benefits but also raising critical safety and
ethical concerns. According to the European Union AI Act, most MIS will be
classified as high-risk systems, requiring a formal risk management process to
ensure compliance with the ethical requirements of trustworthy AI. In this
context, we focus on risk reduction optimization problems, which aim to reduce
risks with ethical considerations by finding the best balanced assignment of
risk assessment values according to their coverage of trustworthy AI ethical
requirements. We formalize this problem as a constrained optimization task and
investigate three resolution paradigms: Mixed Integer Programming (MIP),
Satisfiability (SAT), and Constraint Programming(CP).Our contributions include
the mathematical formulation of this optimization problem, its modeling with
the Minizinc constraint modeling language, and a comparative experimental study
that analyzes the performance, expressiveness, and scalability of each approach
to solving. From the identified limits of the methodology, we draw some
perspectives of this work regarding the integration of the Minizinc model into
a complete trustworthy AI ethical risk management process for MIS.

### [330] [CompassLLM: A Multi-Agent Approach toward Geo-Spatial Reasoning for Popular Path Query](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07516)
*Md. Nazmul Islam Ananto,Shamit Fatin,Mohammed Eunus Ali,Md Rizwan Parvez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CompassLLM是一个基于大型语言模型的多智能体框架，用于解决流行路径查询问题，通过搜索和生成两阶段流程，在真实和合成数据集上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统算法和机器学习方法在流行路径查询中需要模型训练、参数调优和数据更新时的重新训练，而大型语言模型在空间和图推理方面展现出的能力为地理空间问题提供了新的解决思路。

Method: CompassLLM采用多智能体框架，包含SEARCH阶段（识别流行路径）和GENERATE阶段（在历史轨迹数据中不存在路径时合成新路径）的两阶段流水线。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上的实验表明，CompassLLM在SEARCH阶段表现出卓越的准确性，在GENERATE阶段具有竞争力，同时成本效益高。

Conclusion: CompassLLM成功地将大型语言模型的推理能力应用于地理空间领域，为解决流行路径查询问题提供了一种有效且成本效益高的方法。

Abstract: The popular path query - identifying the most frequented routes between
locations from historical trajectory data - has important applications in urban
planning, navigation optimization, and travel recommendations. While
traditional algorithms and machine learning approaches have achieved success in
this domain, they typically require model training, parameter tuning, and
retraining when accommodating data updates. As Large Language Models (LLMs)
demonstrate increasing capabilities in spatial and graph-based reasoning, there
is growing interest in exploring how these models can be applied to geo-spatial
problems.
  We introduce CompassLLM, a novel multi-agent framework that intelligently
leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs into the geo-spatial domain to
solve the popular path query. CompassLLM employs its agents in a two-stage
pipeline: the SEARCH stage that identifies popular paths, and a GENERATE stage
that synthesizes novel paths in the absence of an existing one in the
historical trajectory data. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show
that CompassLLM demonstrates superior accuracy in SEARCH and competitive
performance in GENERATE while being cost-effective.

TL;DR: RECAP是一个结合确定性正则表达式和上下文感知大语言模型的混合框架，用于在13种低资源语言中检测个人身份信息(PII)，在加权F1分数上比微调NER模型高82%，比零样本LLMs高17%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言中PII检测面临语言多样性和标注数据有限的挑战，需要可扩展的解决方案来满足隐私合规要求。

Method: 采用混合框架，结合正则表达式和上下文感知LLMs，模块化设计支持300多种实体类型而无需重新训练，使用三阶段精炼管道进行消歧和过滤。

Result: 使用nervaluate基准测试，系统在加权F1分数上显著优于微调NER模型(82%)和零样本LLMs(17%)。

Conclusion: RECAP为合规应用中的PII检测提供了一个可扩展且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: The detection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is critical for
privacy compliance but remains challenging in low-resource languages due to
linguistic diversity and limited annotated data. We present RECAP, a hybrid
framework that combines deterministic regular expressions with context-aware
large language models (LLMs) for scalable PII detection across 13 low-resource
locales. RECAP's modular design supports over 300 entity types without
retraining, using a three-phase refinement pipeline for disambiguation and
filtering. Benchmarked with nervaluate, our system outperforms fine-tuned NER
models by 82% and zero-shot LLMs by 17% in weighted F1-score. This work offers
a scalable and adaptable solution for efficient PII detection in
compliance-focused applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文主张当前AI评估存在系统性缺陷，需要建立统一、实时、质量可控的基准测试框架PeerBench，通过密封执行、题库滚动更新和延迟透明等机制来确保评估的诚信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI评估存在数据污染、选择性报告、质量管控不足等问题，导致难以区分真实进展与夸大宣传，削弱了科学信号和公众信任，亟需建立可信的评估范式。

Method: 提出PeerBench框架，采用社区治理模式，包含密封执行、题库银行与滚动更新、延迟透明度等核心机制，构建从设计上就具备鲁棒性的评估体系。

Result: PeerBench提供了一个可操作的蓝图，能够系统性地解决当前AI评估中的漏洞，为建立真正可信的AI进展衡量标准奠定基础。

Conclusion: 当前自由放任的AI评估方法不可持续，必须转向统一、实时、质量可控的基准测试范式，PeerBench为实现这一目标提供了可行的技术路径和治理框架。

Abstract: The meteoric rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with its rapidly expanding
market capitalization, presents both transformative opportunities and critical
challenges. Chief among these is the urgent need for a new, unified paradigm
for trustworthy evaluation, as current benchmarks increasingly reveal critical
vulnerabilities. Issues like data contamination and selective reporting by
model developers fuel hype, while inadequate data quality control can lead to
biased evaluations that, even if unintentionally, may favor specific
approaches. As a flood of participants enters the AI space, this "Wild West" of
assessment makes distinguishing genuine progress from exaggerated claims
exceptionally difficult. Such ambiguity blurs scientific signals and erodes
public confidence, much as unchecked claims would destabilize financial markets
reliant on credible oversight from agencies like Moody's.
  In high-stakes human examinations (e.g., SAT, GRE), substantial effort is
devoted to ensuring fairness and credibility; why settle for less in evaluating
AI, especially given its profound societal impact? This position paper argues
that the current laissez-faire approach is unsustainable. We contend that true,
sustainable AI advancement demands a paradigm shift: a unified, live, and
quality-controlled benchmarking framework robust by construction, not by mere
courtesy and goodwill. To this end, we dissect the systemic flaws undermining
today's AI evaluation, distill the essential requirements for a new generation
of assessments, and introduce PeerBench, a community-governed, proctored
evaluation blueprint that embodies this paradigm through sealed execution, item
banking with rolling renewal, and delayed transparency. Our goal is to pave the
way for evaluations that can restore integrity and deliver genuinely
trustworthy measures of AI progress.

*Bohan Lin,Kuo Yang,Yingchuan Lai,Yudong Zhang,Chen Zhang,Guibin Zhang,Xinlei Yu,Miao Yu,Xu Wang,Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentAsk是一个轻量级的澄清模块，通过插入必要的问题来阻止多智能体系统中消息传递错误的级联传播，显著提升了系统准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于大语言模型的多智能体系统虽然承诺通过协作分工增强问题解决能力，但经常表现不如单智能体基线，原因是边缘级错误级联：一个消息传递中的微小不准确会在整个链中传播。

Method: AgentAsk采用三阶段流程：(i)从精选的失败轨迹中提取边缘级判断形成紧凑策略，(ii)监督策略决定何时/什么/向谁/如何提问，(iii)使用E-GRPO强化学习目标在线优化，平衡准确性、延迟和成本。

Result: 在数学、推理和编码基准测试中，AgentAsk持续提高了公共多智能体实现的准确性和鲁棒性，同时保持最小开销，延迟和额外成本均低于5%，接近强评估器的性能。

Conclusion: 除了经验改进外，本文贡献了边缘级错误的分类原则和链路局部干预的实用方法，为构建更可靠的基于LLM的多智能体系统提供了可扩展路径。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on large language models (LLMs) promise enhanced
problem-solving capabilities through collaborative division of labor. However,
they frequently underperform single-agent baselines due to edge-level error
cascades: minor inaccuracies at one message handoff propagate across the entire
chain. We propose AgentAsk, a lightweight and plug-and-play clarification
module that treats every inter-agent message as a potential failure point and
inserts minimally necessary questions to arrest error propagation. AgentAsk
follows a three-stage pipeline: (i) distilling edge-level judgments from
curated failure traces into a compact policy, (ii) supervising the policy to
determine when/what/whom/how to ask, and (iii) optimizing online with E-GRPO, a
reinforcement learning objective that balances accuracy, latency, and cost. The
module is architecture-agnostic and easy to integrate into existing
orchestration. Across math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks, AgentAsk
consistently improves accuracy and robustness over public multi-agent
implementations while keeping overhead minimal, with latency and extra cost all
less than 5%, approaching the performance of a strong evaluator. Beyond
empirical improvements, we contribute a principled taxonomy of edge-level
errors and a practical recipe for link-local intervention, offering a scalable
pathway toward more reliable LLM-based multi-agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于LLM的顺序多智能体系统中错误在阶段间静默传递的问题，建立可追溯和可问责的系统架构。

Method: 采用Planner->Executor->Critic管道结构，评估8种配置的3种最先进LLM在3个基准测试上的表现，分析错误起源、传播和修复机制。

Result: 结构化可问责的交接显著提高准确性；模型在特定角色上有明显优势和风险；准确度-成本-延迟权衡是任务依赖的，异构管道通常最有效。

Conclusion: 提供了一种实用的数据驱动方法来设计、追踪和调试可靠、可预测和可问责的多智能体系统。

Abstract: Sequential multi-agent systems built with large language models (LLMs) can
automate complex software tasks, but they are hard to trust because errors
quietly pass from one stage to the next. We study a traceable and accountable
pipeline, meaning a system with clear roles, structured handoffs, and saved
records that let us trace who did what at each step and assign blame when
things go wrong. Our setting is a Planner -> Executor -> Critic pipeline. We
evaluate eight configurations of three state-of-the-art LLMs on three
benchmarks and analyze where errors start, how they spread, and how they can be
fixed. Our results show: (1) adding a structured, accountable handoff between
agents markedly improves accuracy and prevents the failures common in simple
pipelines; (2) models have clear role-specific strengths and risks (e.g.,
steady planning vs. high-variance critiquing), which we quantify with repair
and harm rates; and (3) accuracy-cost-latency trade-offs are task-dependent,
with heterogeneous pipelines often the most efficient. Overall, we provide a
practical, data-driven method for designing, tracing, and debugging reliable,
predictable, and accountable multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: 论文主张将生成式AI应用于心理健康服务培训，而非直接作为治疗师聊天机器人，这被认为是更低风险、高影响力的应用场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对AI在心理健康领域的投资和讨论过度关注治疗师聊天机器人，但作者认为这存在风险，应该探索更安全有效的应用方式。

Method: 通过案例研究展示生成式AI如何改进退伍军人相互支持的心理健康培训，突出其在培训领域的应用潜力。

Result: 生成式AI成功提升了心理健康服务提供者的培训效果，特别是在退伍军人群体中展示了实际应用价值。

Conclusion: 应该优先投资于利用生成式AI来支持和扩展心理健康服务提供者的培训，这是比直接部署治疗师聊天机器人更安全且影响深远的选择。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (Generative AI) is transforming
healthcare. With this evolution comes optimism regarding the impact it will
have on mental health, as well as concern regarding the risks that come with
generative AI operating in the mental health domain. Much of the investment in,
and academic and public discourse about, AI-powered solutions for mental health
has focused on therapist chatbots. Despite the common assumption that chatbots
will be the most impactful application of GenAI to mental health, we make the
case here for a lower-risk, high impact use case: leveraging generative AI to
enhance and scale training in mental health service provision. We highlight key
benefits of using generative AI to help train people to provide mental health
services and present a real-world case study in which generative AI improved
the training of veterans to support one another's mental health. With numerous
potential applications of generative AI in mental health, we illustrate why we
should invest in using generative AI to support training people in mental
health service provision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前沿AI模型在组合推理基准上表现不佳，但研究发现这是由于评估指标的系统性低估，而非模型能力不足。

Method: 引入组匹配分数来利用组结构，并提出测试时匹配(TTM)算法，这是一种无需外部监督的自改进方法。

Result: SigLIP-B16超越GPT-4.1，在Winoground上首次超过估计的人类表现，在16个数据集变体上均获得一致改进。

Conclusion: 通过改进评估方法和测试时优化，AI模型在组合推理方面的能力被显著低估，TTM方法能有效提升模型性能。

Abstract: Frontier AI models have achieved remarkable progress, yet recent studies
suggest they struggle with compositional reasoning, often performing at or
below random chance on established benchmarks. We revisit this problem and show
that widely used evaluation metrics systematically underestimate model
capability. To address this, we introduce a group matching score that better
exploits group structure and reveals substantial hidden capability in both
contrastive vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Moreover, simply overfitting to the induced group matchings at test
time transfers this hidden capability into higher scores under standard
evaluation metrics, closing much of the reported gap. This adjustment enables
SigLIP-B16 to surpass all previous results and GPT-4.1 to yield the first
result surpassing estimated human performance on Winoground.
  Building on this insight, we propose Test-Time Matching (TTM), an iterative,
self-improving algorithm that further bootstraps model performance without any
external supervision. TTM delivers additional, non-trivial improvements: for
example, TTM enables SigLIP-B16 to surpass GPT-4.1 on MMVP-VLM, establishing a
new state of the art. Importantly, TTM remains broadly effective even on
benchmarks without metric-induced effects or group structures, achieving
relative gains up to 85.7% on challenging datasets such as WhatsUp. Across 16
dataset variants spanning diverse setups, our experiments demonstrate that TTM
consistently improves model performance and advances the frontier of
compositional reasoning.

TL;DR: 论文提出"有意义透明度"概念，旨在让公众能够理解并参与影响其生活的AI系统决策，将理解与行动可能性联系起来。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI透明度实践主要关注技术层面的算法解释，难以让公众理解，缺乏行动指导，且未考虑决策的广泛社会物质背景。

Method: 结合以人为中心的AI透明度方法和社会技术系统视角，发展公民AI系统的有意义透明度概念。

Result: 提出了有意义透明度的理论框架，强调透明度应连接理解与行动可能性，让公众能够参与AI决策过程。

Conclusion: 有意义透明度是改善公民AI系统的重要原则，能够增强公众对AI决策的理解和参与能力。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has become a part of the provision of governmental
services, from making decisions about benefits to issuing fines for parking
violations. However, AI systems rarely live up to the promise of neutral
optimisation, creating biased or incorrect outputs and reducing the agency of
both citizens and civic workers to shape the way decisions are made.
Transparency is a principle that can both help subjects understand decisions
made about them and shape the processes behind those decisions. However,
transparency as practiced around AI systems tends to focus on the production of
technical objects that represent algorithmic aspects of decision making. These
are often difficult for publics to understand, do not connect to potential for
action, and do not give insight into the wider socio-material context of
decision making. In this paper, we build on existing approaches that take a
human-centric view on AI transparency, combined with a socio-technical systems
view, to develop the concept of meaningful transparency for civic AI systems:
transparencies that allow publics to engage with AI systems that affect their
lives, connecting understanding with potential for action.

TL;DR: 提出Safe OPG方法保证推荐系统中探索新物品时的安全性，并通过Deployment-Efficient Policy Learning框架解决安全性与探索性之间的权衡问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实推荐系统中频繁添加新物品，现有离线策略学习方法在存在新物品时可能不安全，需要开发能保证安全性的探索框架

Method: 开发Safe OPG（基于高置信度离线策略评估的模型无关安全OPL方法），并提出Deployment-Efficient Policy Learning框架，利用安全边际并在多次部署中逐步放松安全正则化

Result: Safe OPG几乎总能满足安全要求，但过于保守；新框架能在保证安全的同时有效探索新物品

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够在保证推荐系统安全实施的同时，实现对新颖物品的有效探索

Abstract: In many real recommender systems, novel items are added frequently over time.
The importance of sufficiently presenting novel actions has widely been
acknowledged for improving long-term user engagement. A recent work builds on
Off-Policy Learning (OPL), which trains a policy from only logged data,
however, the existing methods can be unsafe in the presence of novel actions.
Our goal is to develop a framework to enforce exploration of novel actions with
a guarantee for safety. To this end, we first develop Safe Off-Policy Policy
Gradient (Safe OPG), which is a model-free safe OPL method based on a high
confidence off-policy evaluation. In our first experiment, we observe that Safe
OPG almost always satisfies a safety requirement, even when existing methods
violate it greatly. However, the result also reveals that Safe OPG tends to be
too conservative, suggesting a difficult tradeoff between guaranteeing safety
and exploring novel actions. To overcome this tradeoff, we also propose a novel
framework called Deployment-Efficient Policy Learning for Safe User
Exploration, which leverages safety margin and gradually relaxes safety
regularization during multiple (not many) deployments. Our framework thus
enables exploration of novel actions while guaranteeing safe implementation of
recommender systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM作为AI代理核心控制单元时缺乏个性化交互能力，RAG虽然提升了上下文感知但无法结合用户特定数据，现有个性化研究多为概念性而缺乏技术实现。

Method: 基于统一个性化定义推导技术需求，结合多代理协作和多源检索等成熟AI模式，构建集成持久记忆、动态协调、自我验证和演进用户档案的框架。

Conclusion: 研究为未来工作提供指导，突显了集成持久记忆和用户档案在提升LLM代理适应性和感知个性化方面的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as the central control unit
of AI agents, yet current approaches remain limited in their ability to deliver
personalized interactions. While Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances LLM
capabilities by improving context-awareness, it lacks mechanisms to combine
contextual information with user-specific data. Although personalization has
been studied in fields such as human-computer interaction or cognitive science,
existing perspectives largely remain conceptual, with limited focus on
technical implementation. To address these gaps, we build on a unified
definition of personalization as a conceptual foundation to derive technical
requirements for adaptive, user-centered LLM-based agents. Combined with
established agentic AI patterns such as multi-agent collaboration or
multi-source retrieval, we present a framework that integrates persistent
memory, dynamic coordination, self-validation, and evolving user profiles to
enable personalized long-term interactions. We evaluate our approach on three
public datasets using metrics such as retrieval accuracy, response correctness,
or BertScore. We complement these results with a five-day pilot user study
providing initial insights into user feedback on perceived personalization. The
study provides early indications that guide future work and highlights the
potential of integrating persistent memory and user profiles to improve the
adaptivity and perceived personalization of LLM-based agents.

Motivation: 现有STL引导的强化学习方法使用基于全局路径评估的奖励函数，这些奖励稀疏且无法准确累积局部变化，导致训练不收敛和性能不稳定。

Method: 采用STL在线因果监控，在每个控制步骤持续监控系统行为，计算满足或违反规范的量化距离，生成瞬时奖励。同时提供因果语义的平滑近似以克服不连续性，使其适用于深度RL方法。

Result: 在Gym环境中的多种连续控制基准测试表明，该方法在鲁棒性和效率上优于现有的STL引导RL方法。

Conclusion: 提出的STL引导RL方法为深度RL提供了更鲁棒和高效的奖励生成框架，通过在线因果语义改善了训练稳定性和性能。

Abstract: In real-time and safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPSs), control
synthesis must guarantee that generated policies meet stringent timing and
correctness requirements under uncertain and dynamic conditions. Signal
temporal logic (STL) has emerged as a powerful formalism of expressing
real-time constraints, with its semantics enabling quantitative assessment of
system behavior. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning (RL) has become an important
method for solving control synthesis problems in unknown environments. Recent
studies incorporate STL-based reward functions into RL to automatically
synthesize control policies. However, the automatically inferred rewards
obtained by these methods represent the global assessment of a whole or partial
path but do not accumulate the rewards of local changes accurately, so the
sparse global rewards may lead to non-convergence and unstable training
performances. In this paper, we propose an online reward generation method
guided by the online causation monitoring of STL. Our approach continuously
monitors system behavior against an STL specification at each control step,
computing the quantitative distance toward satisfaction or violation and
thereby producing rewards that reflect instantaneous state dynamics.
Additionally, we provide a smooth approximation of the causation semantics to
overcome the discontinuity of the causation semantics and make it
differentiable for using deep-RL methods. We have implemented a prototype tool
and evaluated it in the Gym environment on a variety of continuously controlled
benchmarks. Experimental results show that our proposed STL-guided RL method
with online causation semantics outperforms existing relevant STL-guided RL
methods, providing a more robust and efficient reward generation framework for
deep-RL.

Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在化学任务中表现出潜力，但尚不清楚其是否具备真正的化学推理能力，包括生成有效中间体、保持化学一致性和遵循逻辑连贯的多步路径。

Method: 引入oMeBench（首个大规模专家策划的有机机理推理基准）和oMeS（结合步骤级逻辑和化学相似性的动态评估框架），分析最先进大语言模型的性能。

Result: 当前模型显示出有前景的化学直觉，但在正确和一致的多步推理方面存在困难。通过提示策略和在所提数据集上微调专家模型，性能比领先闭源模型提高50%。

Conclusion: oMeBench将为推进AI系统实现真正的化学推理提供严格基础。

Abstract: Organic reaction mechanisms are the stepwise elementary reactions by which
reactants form intermediates and products, and are fundamental to understanding
chemical reactivity and designing new molecules and reactions. Although large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise in understanding chemical tasks such
as synthesis design, it is unclear to what extent this reflects genuine
chemical reasoning capabilities, i.e., the ability to generate valid
intermediates, maintain chemical consistency, and follow logically coherent
multi-step pathways. We address this by introducing oMeBench, the first
large-scale, expert-curated benchmark for organic mechanism reasoning in
organic chemistry. It comprises over 10,000 annotated mechanistic steps with
intermediates, type labels, and difficulty ratings. Furthermore, to evaluate
LLM capability more precisely and enable fine-grained scoring, we propose oMeS,
a dynamic evaluation framework that combines step-level logic and chemical
similarity. We analyze the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, and our
results show that although current models display promising chemical intuition,
they struggle with correct and consistent multi-step reasoning. Notably, we
find that using prompting strategy and fine-tuning a specialist model on our
proposed dataset increases performance by 50% over the leading closed-source
model. We hope that oMeBench will serve as a rigorous foundation for advancing

*Minh-Anh Nguye,Minh-Duc Nguyen,Nguyen Thi Ha Lan,Kieu Hai Dang,Nguyen Tien Dong,Le Duy Dung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SurveyG是一个基于LLM的智能体框架，通过整合分层引用图来生成更结构化和全面的综述论文，解决了现有方法忽视论文间结构关系的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM生成综述的方法通常直接总结大量相关论文，但忽视了论文间的结构关系，导致生成的综述缺乏连贯的分类体系和深层上下文理解。

Method: 提出SurveyG框架，整合分层引用图（基础层、发展层、前沿层），结合横向层内搜索和纵向跨层遍历，生成多层次摘要，并通过多智能体验证确保一致性、覆盖面和事实准确性。

Result: 实验表明，SurveyG在人类专家和LLM作为评判者的评估中均优于现有最先进框架，生成的综述更全面且更好地符合领域知识分类体系。

Conclusion: SurveyG通过整合结构化和上下文知识，显著提升了LLM生成综述的质量，特别是在分类连贯性和领域理解深度方面。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for automating survey
paper generation \cite{wang2406autosurvey, liang2025surveyx,
yan2025surveyforge,su2025benchmarking,wen2025interactivesurvey}. Existing
approaches typically extract content from a large collection of related papers
and prompt LLMs to summarize them directly. However, such methods often
overlook the structural relationships among papers, resulting in generated
surveys that lack a coherent taxonomy and a deeper contextual understanding of
research progress. To address these shortcomings, we propose \textbf{SurveyG},
an LLM-based agent framework that integrates \textit{hierarchical citation
graph}, where nodes denote research papers and edges capture both citation
dependencies and semantic relatedness between their contents, thereby embedding
structural and contextual knowledge into the survey generation process. The
graph is organized into three layers: \textbf{Foundation},
\textbf{Development}, and \textbf{Frontier}, to capture the evolution of
research from seminal works to incremental advances and emerging directions. By
combining horizontal search within layers and vertical depth traversal across
layers, the agent produces multi-level summaries, which are consolidated into a
structured survey outline. A multi-agent validation stage then ensures
consistency, coverage, and factual accuracy in generating the final survey.
Experiments, including evaluations by human experts and LLM-as-a-judge,
demonstrate that SurveyG outperforms state-of-the-art frameworks, producing
surveys that are more comprehensive and better structured to the underlying
knowledge taxonomy of a field.

*Yilun Zhang,Dexing Kong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MMIA是一个基于LLM的医学智能代理架构，通过形式化可验证的推理过程确保可靠性，将复杂医疗任务分解为原子步骤并进行逻辑审核，支持从零推理到低成本验证的转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在医学领域容易产生事实和逻辑错误的问题，因为这在高风险医疗环境中是不可接受的。

Method: 递归分解复杂医疗任务为原子证据步骤，自动审核推理链的逻辑一致性和证据可追溯性，采用"引导"模式存储已验证推理链作为"定理"，后续任务使用RAG进行高效解决。

Result: 在四个医疗管理领域验证，错误检测率超过98%，误报率低于1%，显著优于基线LLM，RAG模式预计可降低85%处理成本。

Conclusion: MMIA的可验证推理框架是创建可信赖、透明且经济高效AI系统的重要进展，使LLM技术能够在关键医疗应用中可行。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in medicine but are prone to
factual and logical errors, which is unacceptable in this high-stakes field. To
address this, we introduce the "Haibu Mathematical-Medical Intelligent Agent"
(MMIA), an LLM-driven architecture that ensures reliability through a formally
verifiable reasoning process. MMIA recursively breaks down complex medical
tasks into atomic, evidence-based steps. This entire reasoning chain is then
automatically audited for logical coherence and evidence traceability, similar
to theorem proving. A key innovation is MMIA's "bootstrapping" mode, which
stores validated reasoning chains as "theorems." Subsequent tasks can then be
efficiently solved using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), shifting from
costly first-principles reasoning to a low-cost verification model. We
validated MMIA across four healthcare administration domains, including DRG/DIP
audits and medical insurance adjudication, using expert-validated benchmarks.
Results showed MMIA achieved an error detection rate exceeding 98% with a false
positive rate below 1%, significantly outperforming baseline LLMs. Furthermore,
the RAG matching mode is projected to reduce average processing costs by
approximately 85% as the knowledge base matures. In conclusion, MMIA's
verifiable reasoning framework is a significant step toward creating
trustworthy, transparent, and cost-effective AI systems, making LLM technology
viable for critical applications in medicine.

*Xiangwei Lv,JinLuan Yang,Wang Lin,Jingyuan Chen,Beishui Liao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出GRAIL框架，将测试时图域适应重新定义为生成式图恢复问题，利用LLM将目标图恢复到类源域状态，无需访问源域数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图域适应方法依赖源域数据，但源域数据常因隐私或安全问题不可用，因此需要开发无需源域数据的测试时图域适应方法。

Method: 首先压缩节点表示为紧凑潜在特征，使用图扩散过程建模图恢复过程，量化模块将恢复特征编码为离散标记，然后微调LLM作为生成式恢复器，并通过强化学习优化恢复质量。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: GRAIL框架成功解决了测试时图域适应问题，通过生成式图恢复方法在无需源域数据的情况下实现了有效的域适应。

Abstract: Graph domain adaptation (GDA) has achieved great attention due to its
effectiveness in addressing the domain shift between train and test data. A
significant bottleneck in existing graph domain adaptation methods is their
reliance on source-domain data, which is often unavailable due to privacy or
security concerns. This limitation has driven the development of Test-Time
Graph Domain Adaptation (TT-GDA), which aims to transfer knowledge without
accessing the source examples. Inspired by the generative power of large
language models (LLMs), we introduce a novel framework that reframes TT-GDA as
a generative graph restoration problem, "restoring the target graph to its
pristine, source-domain-like state". There are two key challenges: (1) We need
to construct a reasonable graph restoration process and design an effective
encoding scheme that an LLM can understand, bridging the modality gap. (2) We
need to devise a mechanism to ensure the restored graph acquires the intrinsic
features of the source domain, even without access to the source data. To
ensure the effectiveness of graph restoration, we propose GRAIL, that restores
the target graph into a state that is well-aligned with the source domain.
Specifically, we first compress the node representations into compact latent
features and then use a graph diffusion process to model the graph restoration
process. Then a quantization module encodes the restored features into discrete
tokens. Building on this, an LLM is fine-tuned as a generative restorer to
transform a "noisy" target graph into a "native" one. To further improve
restoration quality, we introduce a reinforcement learning process guided by
specialized alignment and confidence rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach across various datasets.

TL;DR: ACONIC框架通过将任务建模为约束问题并利用形式化复杂度度量来指导分解，显著提升了LLM在复杂任务上的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂任务上存在可靠性问题，现有分解方法依赖启发式或手动分解，缺乏系统性指导。

Method: 提出ACONIC框架，将任务建模为约束问题，使用形式化复杂度度量来指导任务分解。

Result: 在组合优化(SATBench)和数据库查询(Spider)任务上，基于复杂度度量的分解使智能体性能显著提升10-40个百分点。

Conclusion: ACONIC框架通过系统性分解方法有效解决了LLM在复杂任务上的可靠性问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from reliability issues on complex tasks,
as existing decomposition methods are heuristic and rely on agent or manual
decomposition. This work introduces a novel, systematic decomposition framework
that we call Analysis of CONstraint-Induced Complexity (ACONIC), which models
the task as a constraint problem and leveraging formal complexity measures to
guide decomposition. On combinatorial (SATBench) and LLM database querying
tasks (Spider), we find that by decomposing the tasks following the measure of
complexity, agent can perform considerably better (10-40 percentage point).

### [346] [GCPO: When Contrast Fails, Go Gold](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07790)
*Hao Wu,Wei Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了Group Contrastive Policy Optimization (GCPO)方法，通过引入外部标准参考答案来改进强化学习在语言模型推理训练中的效果，解决了GRPO等方法无法从全错或全对样本中学习的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法如GRPO存在明显缺陷：模型rollout响应的上限完全由模型自身决定，无法从全错或全对样本中获取知识。这限制了小模型推理能力的提升。

Method: GCPO方法引入外部标准参考答案，当模型无法解决问题时，参考答案提供正确响应，引导模型向明确准确的更新方向学习。该方法充分利用每个样本，并让模型在训练中模仿参考答案的解题策略。

Result: GCPO在多个基准数据集上取得了优异结果，相比基线模型有显著改进。

Conclusion: GCPO通过引入外部参考答案有效提升了训练效率和模型泛化能力，为增强语言模型推理能力提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been widely applied to enhance the reasoning
capabilities of large language models. Extending the inference limits of
smaller models has become a prominent research focus. However, algorithms such
as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffer from a clear drawback: the
upper bound of a model's rollout responses is entirely determined by the model
itself, preventing the acquisition of knowledge from samples that are either
all incorrect or all correct. In this paper, we introduce Group Contrastive
Policy Optimization (GCPO), a method that incorporates external standard
reference answers. When the model cannot solve a problem, the reference answer
supplies the correct response, steering the model toward an unequivocally
accurate update direction. This approach offers two main advantages: (1) it
improves training efficiency by fully utilizing every sample; (2) it enables
the model to emulate the problem solving strategy of the reference answer
during training, thereby enhancing generalization in reasoning. GCPO achieves
outstanding results across multiple benchmark datasets, yielding substantial
improvements over the baseline model. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: 提出了SHADOW框架，通过强化学习平衡追击者在对抗环境中的信息获取与暴露风险，实现了比基线方法更高的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究对抗环境中智能体面临的关键战略权衡：获取信息增强态势感知的同时可能暴露自身位置，增加被攻击风险。

Method: 提出PEEC博弈模型，设计SHADOW多头部序贯强化学习框架，整合连续导航控制、离散通信动作和对手行为预测建模。

Result: SHADOW追击者相比六个竞争基线实现了更高的成功率，消融研究确认时序建模和对手建模对有效决策至关重要。

Conclusion: 学习到的策略在不同通信风险和物理不对称条件下具有良好的泛化能力，证明了所提方法的有效性。

Abstract: Adversarial environments require agents to navigate a key strategic
trade-off: acquiring information enhances situational awareness, but may
simultaneously expose them to threats. To investigate this tension, we
formulate a PursuitEvasion-Exposure-Concealment Game (PEEC) in which a pursuer
agent must decide when to communicate in order to obtain the evader's position.
Each communication reveals the pursuer's location, increasing the risk of being
targeted. Both agents learn their movement policies via reinforcement learning,
while the pursuer additionally learns a communication policy that balances
observability and risk. We propose SHADOW (Strategic-communication Hybrid
Action Decision-making under partial Observation for Warfare), a multi-headed
sequential reinforcement learning framework that integrates continuous
navigation control, discrete communication actions, and opponent modeling for
behavior prediction. Empirical evaluations show that SHADOW pursuers achieve
higher success rates than six competitive baselines. Our ablation study
confirms that temporal sequence modeling and opponent modeling are critical for
effective decision-making. Finally, our sensitivity analysis reveals that the
learned policies generalize well across varying communication risks and
physical asymmetries between agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有路径搜索算法和强化学习方法难以扩展到城市规模网络，无法有效捕捉城市交通的非线性、随机性和耦合动态特性。

Method: 提出分层LLM框架，包含全局交通分配代理协调区域间交通流分布，以及局部导航代理生成符合全局指令的局部自适应路线。采用协同推理优化机制，通过双奖励结构（个体奖励和共享奖励）进行联合训练。

Result: 在四个真实道路网络（最大160万条道路和43万个交叉口）上的实验表明，CityNav在城市场景旅行效率和拥堵缓解方面持续优于九个经典路径搜索和基于RL的基线方法。

Conclusion: LLM有潜力实现可扩展、自适应和协作的城市范围交通导航，为复杂城市环境中智能大规模车辆路由提供基础。

Abstract: The rise of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technologies is transforming traffic
management from isolated control to a collective, multi-vehicle process. At the
heart of this shift is multi-vehicle dynamic navigation, which requires
simultaneously routing large fleets under evolving traffic conditions. Existing
path search algorithms and reinforcement learning methods struggle to scale to
city-wide networks, often failing to capture the nonlinear, stochastic, and
coupled dynamics of urban traffic. To address these challenges, we propose
CityNav, a hierarchical, LLM-powered framework for large-scale multi-vehicle
navigation. CityNav integrates a global traffic allocation agent, which
coordinates strategic traffic flow distribution across regions, with local
navigation agents that generate locally adaptive routes aligned with global
directives. To enable effective cooperation, we introduce a cooperative
reasoning optimization mechanism, in which agents are jointly trained with a
dual-reward structure: individual rewards promote per-vehicle efficiency, while
shared rewards encourage network-wide coordination and congestion reduction.
Extensive experiments on four real-world road networks of varying scales (up to
1.6 million roads and 430,000 intersections) and traffic datasets demonstrate
that CityNav consistently outperforms nine classical path search and RL-based
baselines in city-scale travel efficiency and congestion mitigation. Our
results highlight the potential of LLMs to enable scalable, adaptive, and
cooperative city-wide traffic navigation, providing a foundation for
intelligent, large-scale vehicle routing in complex urban environments. Our
project is available at https://github.com/usail-hkust/CityNav.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made substantial progress in
recent years. However, their rigorous evaluation within specialized domains
like finance is hindered by the absence of datasets characterized by
professional-level knowledge intensity, detailed annotations, and advanced
reasoning complexity. To address this critical gap, we introduce FinMR, a

tasks across multiple image types. Through comprehensive benchmarking with
leading closed-source and open-source MLLMs, we highlight significant
performance disparities between these models and professional financial
analysts, uncovering key areas for model advancement, such as precise image
analysis, accurate application of complex financial formulas, and deeper
contextual financial understanding. By providing richly varied visual content
and thorough explanatory annotations, FinMR establishes itself as an essential

Result: 在真实世界数据集上与25个基线方法对比，Augur实现了竞争性性能并展现出强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: Augur框架通过利用LLM的因果推理能力，在提高预测准确性的同时提供了透明、可追溯的变量交互推理，为LLM在时间序列预测中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) have emerged as a promising avenue for time
series forecasting, offering the potential to integrate multimodal data.
However, existing LLM-based approaches face notable limitations-such as
marginalized role in model architectures, reliance on coarse statistical text
prompts, and lack of interpretability. In this work, we introduce Augur, a
fully LLM driven time series forecasting framework that exploits LLM causal
reasoning to discover and use directed causal associations among covariates.
Augur uses a two stage teacher student architecture where a powerful teacher
LLM infers a directed causal graph from time series using heuristic search
together with pairwise causality testing. A lightweight student agent then
refines the graph and fine tune on high confidence causal associations that are
encoded as rich textual prompts to perform forecasting. This design improves
predictive accuracy while yielding transparent, traceable reasoning about
variable interactions. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets with 25
baselines demonstrate that Augur achieves competitive performance and robust
zero-shot generalization.

Conclusion: DeepResearch-ReportEval为评估DeepResearch系统提供了全面框架，有助于推动该领域从信息助手向智能研究伙伴的发展。

Abstract: DeepResearch agents represent a transformative AI paradigm, conducting
expert-level research through sophisticated reasoning and multi-tool
integration. However, evaluating these systems remains critically challenging
due to open-ended research scenarios and existing benchmarks that focus on
isolated capabilities rather than holistic performance. Unlike traditional LLM
tasks, DeepResearch systems must synthesize diverse sources, generate insights,
and present coherent findings, which are capabilities that resist simple
verification. To address this gap, we introduce DeepResearch-ReportEval, a
comprehensive framework designed to assess DeepResearch systems through their
most representative outputs: research reports. Our approach systematically
measures three dimensions: quality, redundancy, and factuality, using an
innovative LLM-as-a-Judge methodology achieving strong expert concordance. We
contribute a standardized benchmark of 100 curated queries spanning 12
real-world categories, enabling systematic capability comparison. Our
evaluation of four leading commercial systems reveals distinct design
philosophies and performance trade-offs, establishing foundational insights as
DeepResearch evolves from information assistants toward intelligent research

Conclusion: FactFin框架有效缓解了LLM金融代理中的信息泄漏问题，并发布了泄漏鲁棒性评估基准FinLake-Bench。

Abstract: LLM-based financial agents have attracted widespread excitement for their
ability to trade like human experts. However, most systems exhibit a "profit
mirage": dazzling back-tested returns evaporate once the model's knowledge
window ends, because of the inherent information leakage in LLMs. In this
paper, we systematically quantify this leakage issue across four dimensions and
release FinLake-Bench, a leakage-robust evaluation benchmark. Furthermore, to
mitigate this issue, we introduce FactFin, a framework that applies
counterfactual perturbations to compel LLM-based agents to learn causal drivers
instead of memorized outcomes. FactFin integrates four core components:
Strategy Code Generator, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Monte Carlo Tree
Search, and Counterfactual Simulator. Extensive experiments show that our
method surpasses all baselines in out-of-sample generalization, delivering
superior risk-adjusted performance.

Abstract: Query-product relevance analysis is a foundational technology in e-commerce
search engines and has become increasingly important in AI-driven e-commerce.
The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities, offers promising opportunities
for developing relevance systems that are both more interpretable and more
robust. However, existing training paradigms have notable limitations: SFT and
DPO suffer from poor generalization on long-tail queries and from a lack of
fine-grained, stepwise supervision to enforce rule-aligned reasoning. In
contrast, reinforcement learning with verification rewards (RLVR) suffers from
sparse feedback, which provides insufficient signal to correct erroneous
intermediate steps, thereby undermining logical consistency and limiting
performance in complex inference scenarios.
  To address these challenges, we introduce the Stepwise Hybrid Examination
Reinforcement Learning framework for Taobao Search Relevance (TaoSR-SHE). At
its core is Stepwise Reward Policy Optimization (SRPO), a reinforcement
learning algorithm that leverages step-level rewards generated by a hybrid of a
high-quality generative stepwise reward model and a human-annotated offline
verifier, prioritizing learning from critical correct and incorrect reasoning
steps. TaoSR-SHE further incorporates two key techniques: diversified data
filtering to encourage exploration across varied reasoning paths and mitigate
policy entropy collapse, and multi-stage curriculum learning to foster
progressive capability growth. Extensive experiments on real-world search
benchmarks show that TaoSR-SHE improves both reasoning quality and
relevance-prediction accuracy in large-scale e-commerce settings, outperforming
SFT, DPO, GRPO, and other baselines, while also enhancing interpretability and
robustness.

Abstract: Large-scale Speech Language Models (SpeechLMs) have enabled voice assistants
capable of understanding natural spoken queries and performing complex tasks.
However, existing speech benchmarks primarily focus on isolated capabilities
such as transcription, or question-answering, and do not systematically
evaluate agentic scenarios encompassing multilingual and cultural
understanding, as well as adversarial robustness. To address this, we introduce
VoiceAgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate SpeechLMs in
realistic spoken agentic settings. It comprises over 5,500 synthetic spoken
queries, including dialogues grounded in Indian context, covering single-tool
invocations, multi-tool workflows, multi-turn interactions, and safety
evaluations. The benchmark supports English, Hindi, and 5 other Indian
languages, reflecting real-world linguistic and cultural diversity. We simulate
speaker variability using a novel sampling algorithm that selects audios for
TTS voice conversion based on its speaker embeddings, maximizing acoustic and
speaker diversity. Our evaluation measures tool selection accuracy, structural
consistency, and the correctness of tool invocations, including adversarial
robustness. Our experiments reveal significant gaps in contextual tool
orchestration tasks, Indic generalization, and adversarial robustness, exposing

*Haitao Jia,Ming He,Zimo Yin,Likang Wu,Jianping Fan,Jitao Sang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReInAgent是一个上下文感知的多代理框架，通过动态信息管理和人机协作解决移动GUI代理在信息困境中的局限性，在复杂任务中比Mobile-Agent-v2成功率提高25%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有移动GUI代理过度强调自主操作，忽视了用户参与的必要性，导致在模糊、动态变化和冲突的任务场景中适应性不足，执行结果偏离用户真实需求和偏好。

Method: 提出ReInAgent框架，集成三个专门代理：信息管理代理负责槽位信息管理和主动用户交互，决策代理负责冲突感知规划，反思代理负责任务反思和信息一致性验证，通过共享内存模块协同工作。

Result: 实验结果表明ReInAgent能有效解决信息困境，产生更符合用户偏好的结果，在涉及信息困境的复杂任务中比Mobile-Agent-v2成功率提高25%。

Conclusion: ReInAgent通过持续上下文信息分析和持续的人机协作，克服了现有方法依赖清晰静态任务假设的局限性，实现了在复杂现实场景中更自适应和可靠的移动任务导航。

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents exhibit substantial potential to facilitate and automate
the execution of user tasks on mobile phones. However, exist mobile GUI agents
predominantly privilege autonomous operation and neglect the necessity of
active user engagement during task execution. This omission undermines their
adaptability to information dilemmas including ambiguous, dynamically evolving,
and conflicting task scenarios, leading to execution outcomes that deviate from
genuine user requirements and preferences. To address these shortcomings, we
propose ReInAgent, a context-aware multi-agent framework that leverages dynamic
information management to enable human-in-the-loop mobile task navigation.
ReInAgent integrates three specialized agents around a shared memory module: an
information-managing agent for slot-based information management and proactive
interaction with the user, a decision-making agent for conflict-aware planning,
and a reflecting agent for task reflection and information consistency
validation. Through continuous contextual information analysis and sustained
user-agent collaboration, ReInAgent overcomes the limitation of existing
approaches that rely on clear and static task assumptions. Consequently, it
enables more adaptive and reliable mobile task navigation in complex,
real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that ReInAgent
effectively resolves information dilemmas and produces outcomes that are more
closely aligned with genuine user preferences. Notably, on complex tasks
involving information dilemmas, ReInAgent achieves a 25% higher success rate
than Mobile-Agent-v2.

*Alex O. Davies,Roussel Nzoyem,Nirav Ajmeri,Telmo M. Silva Filho*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究表明语言模型在表示数值时存在非连续性和噪声问题，尽管能够高精度重建数值，但主成分分析显示嵌入空间的大部分变化与数值输入空间正交。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型是否真正将连续值建模为连续表示，以及它们在数值表示中的特性。

Method: 使用线性重建和主成分分析评估三个主要提供商（OpenAI、Google Gemini、Voyage AI）的语言模型在数值嵌入空间中的表现。

Result: 虽然重建精度高（R²≥0.95），但主成分只能解释嵌入空间变化的一小部分，且随着小数精度的增加，线性重建和解释方差都会下降。

Conclusion: 语言模型在表示数值时引入显著噪声和非连续性，这对需要高数值精度、大数值范围或混合符号值的应用领域具有重要影响。

Abstract: Recent research has extensively studied how large language models manipulate
integers in specific arithmetic tasks, and on a more fundamental level, how
they represent numeric values. These previous works have found that language
model embeddings can be used to reconstruct the original values, however, they
do not evaluate whether language models actually model continuous values as
continuous. Using expected properties of the embedding space, including linear
reconstruction and principal component analysis, we show that language models
not only represent numeric spaces as non-continuous but also introduce
significant noise. Using models from three major providers (OpenAI, Google
Gemini and Voyage AI), we show that while reconstruction is possible with high
fidelity ($R^2 \geq 0.95$), principal components only explain a minor share of
variation within the embedding space. This indicates that many components
within the embedding space are orthogonal to the simple numeric input space.
Further, both linear reconstruction and explained variance suffer with
increasing decimal precision, despite the ordinal nature of the input space
being fundamentally unchanged. The findings of this work therefore have
implications for the many areas where embedding models are used, in-particular
where high numerical precision, large magnitudes or mixed-sign values are
common.

*Chen Huang,Wei Lu,Wenxuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PEAR是一种基于阶段熵感知的奖励机制，通过在不同推理阶段调整熵值来控制大推理模型的响应长度，在保持准确性的同时减少冗余推理步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大推理模型生成的推理链往往过长且包含冗余步骤，增加了推理成本并降低了可用性。如何在保持准确性的同时控制推理长度是一个开放挑战。

Method: 提出PEAR奖励机制，在思考阶段惩罚过高熵值以鼓励简洁推理，在最终答案阶段允许适度探索以保持灵活性，实现自适应长度控制。

Result: 在四个基准测试上的实验表明，PEAR能持续减少响应长度，同时在不同模型规模下保持竞争力准确性，并展现出良好的分布外鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PEAR通过阶段依赖的熵控制，有效平衡了推理的简洁性和性能，为自适应长度控制提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive performance on complex
reasoning tasks by generating detailed chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations.
However, these responses are often excessively long, containing redundant
reasoning steps that inflate inference cost and reduce usability. Controlling
the length of generated reasoning without sacrificing accuracy remains an open
challenge. Through a systematic empirical analysis, we reveal a consistent
positive correlation between model entropy and response length at different
reasoning stages across diverse LRMs: the thinking phase exhibits higher
entropy, reflecting exploratory behavior of longer responses, while the final
answer phase shows lower entropy, indicating a more deterministic solution.This
observation suggests that entropy at different reasoning stages can serve as a
control knob for balancing conciseness and performance. Based on this insight,
this paper introduces Phase Entropy Aware Reward (PEAR), a reward mechanism
that incorporating phase-dependent entropy into the reward design. Instead of
treating all tokens uniformly, PEAR penalize excessive entropy during the
thinking phase and allowing moderate exploration at the final answer phase,
which encourages models to generate concise reasoning traces that retain
sufficient flexibility to solve the task correctly. This enables adaptive
control of response length without relying on explicit length targets or rigid
truncation rules. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks demonstrate that
PEAR consistently reduces response length while sustaining competitive accuracy
across model scales. In addition, PEAR demonstrates strong out-of-distribution
(OOD) robustness beyond the training distribution. Our code is available at:

*Xiaoshuang Ji,Zhendong Zhao,Xiaoyan Gu,Xiaojun Chen,Xin Zhao,Zeyao Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AILoRA是一种新型参数高效微调方法，通过引入函数感知的非对称低秩先验来改进LoRA，针对自注意力机制中W^Q和W^V矩阵的不同功能特性进行非对称初始化，提升微调性能和收敛效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA虽然被广泛采用，但仍面临性能欠佳和收敛缓慢的问题。研究发现W^Q和W^V矩阵具有不同的参数特性：W^Q对下游任务变化敏感，而W^V的特征表示跨任务稳定。

Method: 提出AILoRA方法，对W^Q注入主成分以保留任务自适应能力，对W^V注入次成分以保持通用特征表示，实现函数感知的非对称初始化。

Result: 该方法使LoRA模块能更好地捕捉注意力参数的专业化角色，从而提升微调性能和收敛效率。

Conclusion: AILoRA通过利用注意力参数的功能差异进行非对称初始化，有效解决了LoRA的性能和收敛问题，为参数高效微调提供了新思路。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) aims to mitigate the substantial
computational and memory overhead involved in adapting large-scale pretrained
models to diverse downstream tasks. Among numerous PEFT strategies, Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as one of the most widely adopted approaches due
to its robust empirical performance and low implementation complexity. In
practical deployment, LoRA is typically applied to the $W^Q$ and $W^V$
projection matrices of self-attention modules, enabling an effective trade-off
between model performance and parameter efficiency. While LoRA has achieved
considerable empirical success, it still encounters challenges such as
suboptimal performance and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we
introduce \textbf{AILoRA}, a novel parameter-efficient method that incorporates
function-aware asymmetric low-rank priors. Our empirical analysis reveals that
the projection matrices $W^Q$ and $W^V$ in the self-attention mechanism exhibit
distinct parameter characteristics, stemming from their functional differences.
Specifically, $W^Q$ captures task-specific semantic space knowledge essential
for attention distributions computation, making its parameters highly sensitive
to downstream task variations. In contrast, $W^V$ encodes token-level feature
representations that tend to remain stable across tasks and layers. Leveraging
these insights, AILoRA performs a function-aware initialization by injecting
the principal components of $W^Q$ to retain task-adaptive capacity, and the
minor components of $W^V$ to preserve generalizable feature representations.
This asymmetric initialization strategy enables LoRA modules to better capture
the specialized roles of attention parameters, thereby enhancing both
finetuning performance and convergence efficiency.

TL;DR: LinguaSim是一个基于大语言模型的框架，可将自然语言转换为真实、交互式的3D场景，确保动态车辆交互和输入描述与生成场景的忠实对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在平衡指令遵循准确性和真实世界驾驶环境真实性方面存在困难，常常为了降低场景描述复杂度而牺牲真实性，限制场景为2D或开放循环模拟。

Method: 提出LinguaSim框架，包含反馈校准模块来优化生成精度，通过自然语言和闭环交互模拟之间的桥梁，约束对抗性车辆行为。

Result: 实验显示LinguaSim能生成与不同自然语言描述对齐的具有不同关键性的场景（危险描述ACT：0.072秒 vs 安全描述：3.532秒；舒适度：0.654 vs 0.764），其精炼模块有效降低初始输出的过度攻击性，碰撞率从46.9%降至6.3%。

Conclusion: LinguaSim促进了高保真场景的创建，增强了安全测试和训练能力，成功弥合了自然语言与闭环交互模拟之间的差距。

Abstract: The generation of testing and training scenarios for autonomous vehicles has
drawn significant attention. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled
new scenario generation methods, current methods struggle to balance command
adherence accuracy with the realism of real-world driving environments. To
reduce scenario description complexity, these methods often compromise realism
by limiting scenarios to 2D, or open-loop simulations where background vehicles
follow predefined, non-interactive behaviors. We propose LinguaSim, an
LLM-based framework that converts natural language into realistic, interactive
3D scenarios, ensuring both dynamic vehicle interactions and faithful alignment
between the input descriptions and the generated scenarios. A feedback
calibration module further refines the generation precision, improving fidelity
to user intent. By bridging the gap between natural language and closed-loop,
interactive simulations, LinguaSim constrains adversarial vehicle behaviors
using both the scenario description and the autonomous driving model guiding
them. This framework facilitates the creation of high-fidelity scenarios that
enhance safety testing and training. Experiments show LinguaSim can generate
scenarios with varying criticality aligned with different natural language
descriptions (ACT: 0.072 s for dangerous vs. 3.532 s for safe descriptions;
comfortability: 0.654 vs. 0.764), and its refinement module effectively reduces
excessive aggressiveness in LinguaSim's initial outputs, lowering the crash
rate from 46.9% to 6.3% to better match user intentions.

TL;DR: 提出了多条件符合选择（MCCS）算法，将符合选择扩展到多条件场景，实现了在多种条件下严格的FDR控制选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在药物发现、精准医学和大语言模型对齐等资源受限应用中，从大规模数据集中选择高质量候选者至关重要。现有的符合选择方法仅适用于单阈值场景，忽略了实际应用中多条件选择的需求。

Method: 提出了MCCS算法，为合取条件引入了具有区域单调性的新非符合性评分，为析取条件引入了全局Benjamini-Hochberg（BH）过程，建立了具有理论保证的有限样本FDR控制。

Result: 广泛的实验验证了MCCS相对于基线的优越性，其在多样化条件组合、不同现实世界模态和多任务可扩展性方面的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MCCS算法成功扩展了符合选择到多条件场景，在各种多条件环境中实现了严格的FDR控制选择，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Selecting high-quality candidates from large-scale datasets is critically
important in resource-constrained applications such as drug discovery,
precision medicine, and the alignment of large language models. While conformal
selection methods offer a rigorous solution with False Discovery Rate (FDR)
control, their applicability is confined to single-threshold scenarios (i.e., y
> c) and overlooks practical needs for multi-condition selection, such as
conjunctive or disjunctive conditions. In this work, we propose the
Multi-Condition Conformal Selection (MCCS) algorithm, which extends conformal
selection to scenarios with multiple conditions. In particular, we introduce a
novel nonconformity score with regional monotonicity for conjunctive conditions
and a global Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure for disjunctive conditions,
thereby establishing finite-sample FDR control with theoretical guarantees. The
integration of these components enables the proposed method to achieve rigorous
FDR-controlled selection in various multi-condition environments. Extensive
experiments validate the superiority of MCCS over baselines, its
generalizability across diverse condition combinations, different real-world
modalities, and multi-task scalability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoQual是一个基于LLM的代理框架，用于自动发现可解释的特征，特别针对在线评论质量评估，通过模拟人类研究过程迭代生成特征假设并实现工具化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线评论质量评估对电商平台至关重要，但质量是领域依赖且动态的概念。传统方法难以跨领域扩展且无法适应内容模式变化，而深度学习方法缺乏可解释性。

Method: AutoQual框架模拟人类研究过程：通过反思迭代生成特征假设，通过自主工具实现操作化，并在持久内存中积累经验。

Result: 在拥有十亿级用户的大型在线平台上部署，A/B测试显示平均每位用户查看评论数增加0.79%，评论阅读者转化率提高0.27%。

Conclusion: AutoQual成功将数据中隐含的默会知识转化为明确的可计算特征，证明了其在评论质量评估中的有效性，并具有通用框架的潜力。

Abstract: Ranking online reviews by their intrinsic quality is a critical task for
e-commerce platforms and information services, impacting user experience and
business outcomes. However, quality is a domain-dependent and dynamic concept,
making its assessment a formidable challenge. Traditional methods relying on
hand-crafted features are unscalable across domains and fail to adapt to
evolving content patterns, while modern deep learning approaches often produce
black-box models that lack interpretability and may prioritize semantics over
quality. To address these challenges, we propose AutoQual, an LLM-based agent
framework that automates the discovery of interpretable features. While
demonstrated on review quality assessment, AutoQual is designed as a general
framework for transforming tacit knowledge embedded in data into explicit,
computable features. It mimics a human research process, iteratively generating
feature hypotheses through reflection, operationalizing them via autonomous
tool implementation, and accumulating experience in a persistent memory. We
deploy our method on a large-scale online platform with a billion-level user
base. Large-scale A/B testing confirms its effectiveness, increasing average
reviews viewed per user by 0.79% and the conversion rate of review readers by
0.27%.

*Sukriti Bhattacharya,Chitro Majumdar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个可证明公平的AI框架，通过系统性地移除所有敏感信息及其代理，克服当前偏见缓解方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏见缓解方法存在局限性，无法完全消除敏感信息及其代理的影响，需要一种数学上可证明的公平性保证方法。

Method: 使用OWL 2 QL本体工程形式化定义敏感属性，通过逻辑推理推断代理属性，构建捕获偏见模式的sigma代数G，然后通过Delbaen Majumdar最优传输获得公平表示。

Result: 该方法确保真正的独立性而非仅仅去相关，在贷款审批等任务中实现完全公平性，其中ZIP代码等代理属性会揭示种族信息。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个可认证且数学基础扎实的值得信赖AI方法，通过将偏见建模为sigma代数间的依赖关系，将本体知识编译为可测量结构，并使用最优传输作为唯一的公平变换。

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for provably fair AI that overcomes the
limits of current bias mitigation methods by systematically removing all
sensitive information and its proxies. Using ontology engineering in OWL 2 QL,
it formally defines sensitive attributes and infers their proxies through
logical reasoning, constructing a sigma algebra G that captures the full
structure of biased patterns. Fair representations are then obtained via
Delbaen Majumdar optimal transport, which generates variables independent of G
while minimizing L2 distance to preserve accuracy. This guarantees true
independence rather than mere decorrelation. By modeling bias as dependence
between sigma algebras, compiling ontological knowledge into measurable
structures, and using optimal transport as the unique fair transformation, the
approach ensures complete fairness in tasks like loan approval, where proxies
such as ZIP code reveal race. The result is a certifiable and mathematically
grounded method for trustworthy AI.

TL;DR: 该研究调查了语言模型中风险厌恶的可操纵性，发现虽然某些模型与人类行为有一定一致性，但仍存在显著差异，需要改进生物中心的可操纵性度量方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型越来越多地融入AI驱动的决策支持系统，理解其风险行为对于负责任部署至关重要，需要防止系统无意中将用户推向风险决策或嵌入隐藏偏见。

Method: 研究通过检查语言模型在不同经济场景中复制人类风险偏好的能力，重点关注性别特定态度、不确定性、基于角色的决策以及风险厌恶的可操纵性。

Result: 结果显示DeepSeek Reasoner和Gemini-2.0-flash-lite等语言模型与人类行为有一定一致性，但存在显著差异，突显了改进生物中心可操纵性度量的必要性。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁在模型设计方面进一步改进，以确保AI系统更准确地复制人类风险偏好，从而在风险管理环境中提高其有效性，增强AI助手在风险管理中的适用性。

Abstract: Responsible AI demands systems whose behavioral tendencies can be effectively
measured, audited, and adjusted to prevent inadvertently nudging users toward
risky decisions or embedding hidden biases in risk aversion. As language models
(LMs) are increasingly incorporated into AI-driven decision support systems,
understanding their risk behaviors is crucial for their responsible deployment.
This study investigates the manipulability of risk aversion (MoRA) in LMs,
examining their ability to replicate human risk preferences across diverse
economic scenarios, with a focus on gender-specific attitudes, uncertainty,
role-based decision-making, and the manipulability of risk aversion. The
results indicate that while LMs such as DeepSeek Reasoner and
Gemini-2.0-flash-lite exhibit some alignment with human behaviors, notable
discrepancies highlight the need to refine bio-centric measures of
manipulability. These findings suggest directions for refining AI design to
better align human and AI risk preferences and enhance ethical decision-making.
The study calls for further advancements in model design to ensure that AI
systems more accurately replicate human risk preferences, thereby improving
their effectiveness in risk management contexts. This approach could enhance
the applicability of AI assistants in managing risk.

TL;DR: PMFR提出了一种异步知识编排框架，通过解耦知识检索和响应生成来解决开放域对话系统中的延迟-质量权衡问题，在保持响应质量的同时大幅降低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开放域对话系统中知识访问导致的延迟与质量之间的矛盾，当前轻量级模型缺乏推理深度，而工具增强的ReAct代理虽然提高了事实性但存在同步执行导致的交互阻塞问题。

Method: 采用时间解耦框架，包含三个协调组件：知识充足性评估器（实时评估）、轻量级响应生成器（即时交互）和异步知识精炼代理（后台知识增强），通过智能触发机制保持对话流畅性。

Result: 在TopiOCQA数据集上，PMFR实现了95.3%的延迟降低（从23.38秒降至1.09秒），同时保持与重量级同步基线相当的响应质量（GEval-C：0.613 vs 0.620）。

Conclusion: PMFR通过异步知识编排框架成功解决了延迟-质量权衡问题，在显著降低延迟的同时保持了对话质量，为开放域对话系统提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The latency-quality tradeoff is a fundamental constraint in open-domain
dialogue AI systems, since comprehensive knowledge access necessitates
prohibitive response delays. Contemporary approaches offer two inadequate
solutions: lightweight instruct models achieve sub-second latency but lack
reasoning depth, while tool-augmented ReAct agents enhance factuality through
external knowledge at the cost of synchronous execution that blocks interaction
during retrieval processes. PMFR is thus proposed, with a temporal decoupling
framework that fundamentally resolves the contradiction through asynchronous
knowledge orchestration. PMFR employs three coordinated components: (1) a
Knowledge Adequacy Evaluator for real-time sufficiency assessment, (2) a
Lightweight Response Generator for immediate user interaction, and (3) an
Asynchronous Knowledge Refinement Agent for background knowledge enhancement.
This architecture maintains continuous conversational flow while progressively
enriching knowledge coverage through intelligent triggering mechanisms.
Evaluation results on TopiOCQA demonstrate PMFR outperforms brute-force
scaling: PMFR achieves 95.3% latency reduction (23.38s -> 1.09s) while
preserving response quality comparable to heavyweight synchronous baselines
(GEval-C: 0.613 vs. 0.620).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注即时、单视野任务，无法充分评估模型理解和应对复杂长视野场景的能力，需要更全面的评估方法来衡量大型推理模型的长视野推理能力。

Method: 提出R-HORIZON方法，通过查询组合刺激长视野推理行为，构建包含复杂多步推理任务的长视野推理基准，并使用强化学习验证奖励方法训练模型。

Result: 评估发现最先进的大型推理模型在长视野任务上性能显著下降，存在有效推理长度有限和思考预算分配问题。使用R-HORIZON数据进行RLVR训练后，不仅大幅提升多视野推理任务性能，还在标准推理任务上提高7.5个AIME2024分数。

Conclusion: R-HORIZON为增强和评估大型推理模型的长视野推理能力提供了一个可扩展、可控且低成本的范式。

Abstract: Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1,
DeepSeek-R1) have led to remarkable improvements through long Chain-of-Thought
(CoT). However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on immediate, single-horizon
tasks, failing to adequately evaluate models' ability to understand and respond
to complex, long-horizon scenarios. To address this incomplete evaluation of
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), we propose R-HORIZON, a method designed to
stimulate long-horizon reasoning behaviors in LRMs through query composition.
Based on R-HORIZON, we construct a long-horizon reasoning benchmark, comprising
complex multi-step reasoning tasks with interdependent problems that span long
reasoning horizons. Through comprehensive evaluation of LRMs using the
R-HORIZON benchmark, we find that even the most advanced LRMs suffer
significant performance degradation. Our analysis reveals that LRMs exhibit
limited effective reasoning length and struggle to allocate thinking budget
across multiple problems appropriately. Recognizing these limitations, we use
R-HORIZON to construct long-horizon reasoning data for reinforcement learning
with verified rewards (RLVR). Compared to training with single-horizon data,
RLVR with R-HORIZON not only substantially improves performance on the
multi-horizon reasoning tasks, but also promotes accuracy on standard reasoning
tasks, with an increase of 7.5 on AIME2024. These results position R-HORIZON as
a scalable, controllable, and low-cost paradigm for enhancing and evaluating
the long-horizon reasoning capabilities of LRMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI开发和治理集中在少数公司和国家手中，可能导致技术编码狭隘利益并限制公众参与。缺乏可公开审计的多元治理衡量标准。

Method: 开发了AIPI评估框架，通过可验证的实践编码、处理未知证据、报告下限分数和已知分数，并实施可复现的评估流程，包括结构化网络分析、外部评估和专家访谈。

Result: 建立了可靠的测量模型，实现了评估流程的可靠性验证，并报告了试点提供商结果。

Conclusion: AIPI旨在引导激励措施转向多元实践，为政策制定者、采购方和公众提供可比较的证据，促进AI系统的多元治理。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems increasingly mediate knowledge,
communication, and decision making. Development and governance remain
concentrated within a small set of firms and states, raising concerns that
technologies may encode narrow interests and limit public agency. Capability
benchmarks for language, vision, and coding are common, yet public, auditable
measures of pluralistic governance are rare. We define AI pluralism as the
degree to which affected stakeholders can shape objectives, data practices,
safeguards, and deployment. We present the AI Pluralism Index (AIPI), a
transparent, evidence-based instrument that evaluates producers and system
families across four pillars: participatory governance, inclusivity and
diversity, transparency, and accountability. AIPI codes verifiable practices
from public artifacts and independent evaluations, explicitly handling
"Unknown" evidence to report both lower-bound ("evidence") and known-only
scores with coverage. We formalize the measurement model; implement a
reproducible pipeline that integrates structured web and repository analysis,
external assessments, and expert interviews; and assess reliability with
inter-rater agreement, coverage reporting, cross-index correlations, and
sensitivity analysis. The protocol, codebook, scoring scripts, and evidence
graph are maintained openly with versioned releases and a public adjudication
process. We report pilot provider results and situate AIPI relative to adjacent
transparency, safety, and governance frameworks. The index aims to steer
incentives toward pluralistic practice and to equip policymakers, procurers,
and the public with comparable evidence.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了锦标赛树方法(TTM)，一种新的偏好获取和评估框架，仅需m-1次成对比较即可获得完整、互反且一致的比较矩阵，大大减少了认知负担和计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统成对比较方法需要m(m-1)/2次比较，认知负担重，存在不一致性风险，且计算复杂。需要一种更高效、一致的方法来获取专家判断。

Method: TTM方法包含三个阶段：(i)使用减少的目标比较集获取专家判断，(ii)构建一致的成对比较矩阵，(iii)从结果矩阵推导全局价值尺度。该方法通过设计确保一致性。

Result: TTM方法将偏好建模的维度从m(m-1)/2减少到m个参数，确保一致性，最小化认知努力，且与经典卡片法兼容，可处理区间和比率尺度。

Conclusion: 锦标赛树方法提供了一种高效、一致的偏好获取框架，显著减少了认知负担和计算复杂度，并在实际决策场景中具有实用价值。

Abstract: Pairwise comparison methods, such as Fuzzy Preference Relations and Saaty's
Multiplicative Preference Relations, are widely used to model expert judgments
in multi-criteria decision-making. However, their application is limited by the
high cognitive load required to complete $m(m-1)/2$ comparisons, the risk of
inconsistency, and the computational complexity of deriving consistent value
scales. This paper proposes the Tournament Tree Method (TTM), a novel
elicitation and evaluation framework that overcomes these limitations. The TTM
requires only $m-1$ pairwise comparisons to obtain a complete, reciprocal, and
consistent comparison matrix. The method consists of three phases: (i)
elicitation of expert judgments using a reduced set of targeted comparisons,
(ii) construction of the consistent pairwise comparison matrix, and (iii)
derivation of a global value scale from the resulting matrix. The proposed
approach ensures consistency by design, minimizes cognitive effort, and reduces
the dimensionality of preference modeling from $m(m-1)/2$ to $m$ parameters.
Furthermore, it is compatible with the classical Deck of Cards method, and thus
it can handle interval and ratio scales. We have also developed a web-based
tool that demonstrates its practical applicability in real decision-making

Result: DODO在除最有限资源条件外的所有情况下都优于观测方法，通常能以零误差重建因果图结构，在最具挑战性的配置中比最佳基线高出+0.25 F1分数。

Conclusion: 通过自主干预学习因果结构的方法有效，DODO算法在因果图推断方面表现出色，为AI的因果意识发展提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has achieved remarkable advancements in recent years,
yet much of its progress relies on identifying increasingly complex
correlations. Enabling causality awareness in AI has the potential to enhance
its performance by enabling a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms
of the environment. In this paper, we introduce DODO, an algorithm defining how
an Agent can autonomously learn the causal structure of its environment through
repeated interventions. We assume a scenario where an Agent interacts with a
world governed by a causal Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), which dictates the
system's dynamics but remains hidden from the Agent. The Agent's task is to
accurately infer the causal DAG, even in the presence of noise. To achieve
this, the Agent performs interventions, leveraging causal inference techniques
to analyze the statistical significance of observed changes. Results show
better performance for DODO, compared to observational approaches, in all but
the most limited resource conditions. DODO is often able to reconstruct with as
low as zero errors the structure of the causal graph. In the most challenging
configuration, DODO outperforms the best baseline by +0.25 F1 points.

TL;DR: 该论文从因果视角重新审视推理任务，将推理视为选择机制，并提出SR²框架来学习潜在变量间的密集依赖关系，显著提升了推理准确性。


<details>

Motivation: 尽管人类能轻松解决推理任务，但现有大规模语言模型在推理方面仍不可靠。作者希望从因果角度理解推理任务在潜在空间中的行为，为解决其挑战提供见解。

Method: 提出SR²框架，包含三个关键模块：反射表示学习、依赖自精炼和周期性中间对齐。该框架将估计的潜在变量作为反馈纳入选择机制，促进学习潜在表示间的密集依赖关系。

Result: 实验表明该方法在推理准确性上取得显著提升，例如在数独和迷宫任务上，使用比最新方法少8倍的参数实现了超过10%的性能改进。

Conclusion: 从因果视角将推理任务建模为选择机制，并引入潜在变量反馈的SR²框架，能有效处理推理任务中潜在空间的复杂性和密集依赖关系，显著提升模型推理能力。

Abstract: Due to their inherent complexity, reasoning tasks have long been regarded as
rigorous benchmarks for assessing the capabilities of machine learning models,
especially large language models (LLMs). Although humans can solve these tasks
with ease, existing models, even after extensive pre-training and post-training
at scale, still fail to perform reasoning reliably. In this paper, we revisit
reasoning tasks from a causal perspective, seeking to understand their behavior
in latent space and to offer insights for addressing their challenges.
Specifically, we cast reasoning tasks as a selection mechanism, in which
high-level logical concepts function as selection operators on the given
observations, such as, identifying the correct answer in a math problem or
filling the appropriate entry in Sudoku. We emphasize two key properties of
this formulation that shed light on the difficulty of reasoning tasks. First,
the latent space exceeds the observation space in complexity, even when the
correct answer is fully determined by the observed input. Second, the latent
variables, corresponding to logical thought, are densely structured and exhibit
strong dependencies. Building on this formulation, we introduce a framework,
called SR$^2$, that incorporates the estimated latent variables as feedback
into the selection mechanism, thereby facilitating the learning of dense
dependencies among latent representations. The framework consists of three key
modules: reflective representation learning, dependency self-refinement, and
periodic intermediate alignment. Experimentally, we show that our approach
yields significant gains in reasoning accuracy, for example, attaining over
10$\%$ improvement in performance with 8$\times$ fewer parameters on the Sudoku
and Maze tasks over the recent advances.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对LLM智能体的多步后门攻击方法CoTri，通过有序触发序列实现长期控制，攻击成功率接近100%且误触发率接近零，同时还能提升智能体在良性任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型智能体在现实应用中的快速部署，其安全性和鲁棒性引发严重担忧，需要揭示这类智能体的安全漏洞。

Method: CoTri后门攻击使用有序触发序列，从初始触发开始，后续触发从环境中提取，实现多步操控使智能体偏离原始任务。

Result: 实验显示CoTri达到接近完美的攻击成功率，误触发率接近零，且由于训练数据建模环境随机性，植入后门反而提升了智能体在良性任务上的性能和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CoTri实现了对智能体的稳定多步控制，同时提高了其固有鲁棒性和任务能力，这使得攻击更加隐蔽，带来了潜在的安全风险。

Abstract: The rapid deployment of large language model (LLM)-based agents in real-world
applications has raised serious concerns about their trustworthiness. In this
work, we reveal the security and robustness vulnerabilities of these agents
through backdoor attacks. Distinct from traditional backdoors limited to
single-step control, we propose the Chain-of-Trigger Backdoor (CoTri), a
multi-step backdoor attack designed for long-horizon agentic control. CoTri
relies on an ordered sequence. It starts with an initial trigger, and
subsequent ones are drawn from the environment, allowing multi-step
manipulation that diverts the agent from its intended task. Experimental
results show that CoTri achieves a near-perfect attack success rate (ASR) while
maintaining a near-zero false trigger rate (FTR). Due to training data modeling
the stochastic nature of the environment, the implantation of CoTri
paradoxically enhances the agent's performance on benign tasks and even
improves its robustness against environmental distractions. We further validate
CoTri on vision-language models (VLMs), confirming its scalability to
multimodal agents. Our work highlights that CoTri achieves stable, multi-step
control within agents, improving their inherent robustness and task
capabilities, which ultimately makes the attack more stealthy and raises
potential safty risks.

Motivation: 解决多智能体系统在三个核心维度面临的挑战：互操作性、交互协作和知识共享，为构建下一代高效、可扩展和智能的多智能体应用提供基础。

Method: 设计了三层协议框架：HAI（人机交互协议）标准化事件驱动的通信范式；UAP（统一代理协议）通过统一服务发现和协议转换实现异构代理互联；MEK（记忆-提取-知识协议）建立标准化的认知链实现知识共享。

Conclusion: Co-TAP协议框架为构建下一代高效、可扩展和智能的多智能体应用提供了坚实的工程基础和理论指导。

Abstract: This paper proposes Co-TAP (T: Triple, A: Agent, P: Protocol), a three-layer
agent interaction protocol designed to address the challenges faced by
multi-agent systems across the three core dimensions of Interoperability,
Interaction and Collaboration, and Knowledge Sharing. We have designed and
proposed a layered solution composed of three core protocols: the Human-Agent
Interaction Protocol (HAI), the Unified Agent Protocol (UAP), and the
Memory-Extraction-Knowledge Protocol (MEK). HAI focuses on the interaction
layer, standardizing the flow of information between users, interfaces, and
agents by defining a standardized, event-driven communication paradigm. This
ensures the real-time performance, reliability, and synergy of interactions. As
the core of the infrastructure layer, UAP is designed to break down
communication barriers among heterogeneous agents through unified service
discovery and protocol conversion mechanisms, thereby enabling seamless
interconnection and interoperability of the underlying network. MEK, in turn,
operates at the cognitive layer. By establishing a standardized ''Memory (M) -
Extraction (E) - Knowledge (K)'' cognitive chain, it empowers agents with the
ability to learn from individual experiences and form shareable knowledge,
thereby laying the foundation for the realization of true collective
intelligence. We believe this protocol framework will provide a solid
engineering foundation and theoretical guidance for building the next
generation of efficient, scalable, and intelligent multi-agent applications.

Method: 使用尺度等变图元网络(ScaleGMNs)直接在权重空间操作，实现现有模型的单次微调。

Result: 经验证明该方法有效，理论表明CNN中的缩放对称性诱导的规范自由度比MLP更小，这解释了不同架构间的性能差异。

Conclusion: 对称感知元网络是高效且可泛化的神经网络优化的强大方法。

Abstract: Amortized optimization accelerates the solution of related optimization
problems by learning mappings that exploit shared structure across problem
instances. We explore the use of Scale Equivariant Graph Metanetworks
(ScaleGMNs) for this purpose. By operating directly in weight space, ScaleGMNs
enable single-shot fine-tuning of existing models, reducing the need for
iterative optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach
empirically and provide a theoretical result: the gauge freedom induced by
scaling symmetries is strictly smaller in convolutional neural networks than in
multi-layer perceptrons. This insight helps explain the performance differences
observed between architectures in both our work and that of Kalogeropoulos et
al. (2024). Overall, our findings underscore the potential of symmetry-aware
metanetworks as a powerful approach for efficient and generalizable neural
network optimization. Open-source code:

TL;DR: 分析发现大语言模型的反思行为主要是确认性而非修正性，训练更多反思步骤主要提升首次回答正确率而非修正能力，提出动态截断反思的方法可显著减少推理token使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究反思行为在大语言模型推理中的实际贡献，探索反思是否真正能修正初始错误答案。

Method: 系统分析8个推理模型在5个数学数据集上的推理过程，构建不同反思步数的SFT数据集进行训练，提出基于候选答案的动态截断方法。

Result: 反思主要是确认性行为，很少改变初始答案；训练更多反思步骤主要提升首次回答正确率；动态截断方法减少24.5%推理token，准确率仅下降2.9%。

Conclusion: 反思行为在推理中作用有限，主要提升首次回答质量而非修正能力，动态截断方法能有效提高推理效率。

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated significant gains in
reasoning ability, often attributed to their capacity to generate longer chains
of thought and engage in reflective reasoning. However, the contribution of
reflections to performance improvement remains unclear. In this paper, we
systematically analyze the rollouts of eight reasoning models on five
mathematical datasets. We focus on reflective behaviours where the model has
already produced an answer but continues reflecting before finalizing its
output. Our analysis reveals that reflections are predominantly confirmatory
and rarely alter the model's initial answer, a pattern consistent across models
and datasets. To understand the role of reflections in training, we construct
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets with varying amounts of reflection steps.
We observe that training models on rollouts with more reflection steps
primarily enhances first-answer correctness rather than the ability to correct
initially wrong answers through reflections. This motivates us to propose a
question-aware early-stopping method that enhances inference-time token
efficiency by stopping the reasoning process once a few plausible candidate
answers are generated, thereby reducing unnecessary reflection steps. Motivated
by this, we further propose to dynamically truncate the reflections after a
candidate answer has appeared during generation, which reduces reasoning tokens
by 24.5% across five mathematical datasets, within a 2.9% drop in accuracy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出Cover@tau指标来替代Pass@k，以更准确评估语言模型在推理任务中的真实能力边界，避免随机猜测带来的误导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Pass@k指标在大采样预算下可能高估模型推理能力，因为离散答案空间中的成功可能来自随机猜测而非真实推理。

Method: 提出Cover@tau指标，测量模型在至少tau比例补全正确的条件下能解决的问题比例，设置可靠性阈值来过滤随机猜测。

Result: 使用Cover@tau评估RLVR模型显示，相比Pass@1，不同算法的相对排名发生变化，提供了对推理边界的新视角。

Conclusion: Cover@tau能更好地区分真实推理能力和随机猜测，为评估语言模型推理能力提供了更可靠的指标。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm to improve Large Language Models on reasoning tasks such as
coding, math or logic. To assess the reasoning boundary (the fraction of
problems a model can solve) researchers often report Pass@k at large sampling
budgets. Recent results reveal a crossover phenomenon: while RLVR models
outperform the base model at small k values, the base model usually outperforms
them when sampling a very large number of completions. This has been
interpreted as evidence that base models have a larger reasoning boundary. We
argue that on tasks with discrete answer spaces, such as math with numeric
outputs, Pass@k at large k reflects the increasingly higher chance of success
in the limit of the number of trials rather than genuine reasoning, and can
therefore be misleading. We propose Cover@tau, which measures the fraction of
problems that a model can solve for which at least a tau proportion of
completions are correct. Unlike Pass@k, Cover@tau captures reasoning under an
explicit reliability threshold: models that rely on random guessing degrade
rapidly as tau increases. We evaluate several RLVR models using Cover@tau-based
metrics and illustrate how the relative rankings of popular algorithms change
compared to Pass@1, offering a different perspective on reasoning boundaries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统消费者研究成本高昂且存在面板偏差和规模限制，LLM模拟合成消费者时直接询问数值评分会产生不现实的响应分布。

Method: SSR方法：从LLM获取文本响应，通过嵌入相似度将这些响应映射到参考声明的Likert分布。

Result: 在57个个人护理产品调查数据集上测试，SSR达到人类重测信度的90%，保持现实的响应分布(KS相似度>0.85)，同时提供丰富的定性反馈。

Conclusion: 该框架能够实现可扩展的消费者研究模拟，同时保持传统调查指标和可解释性。

Abstract: Consumer research costs companies billions annually yet suffers from panel
biases and limited scale. Large language models (LLMs) offer an alternative by
simulating synthetic consumers, but produce unrealistic response distributions
when asked directly for numerical ratings. We present semantic similarity
rating (SSR), a method that elicits textual responses from LLMs and maps these
to Likert distributions using embedding similarity to reference statements.
Testing on an extensive dataset comprising 57 personal care product surveys
conducted by a leading corporation in that market (9,300 human responses), SSR
achieves 90% of human test-retest reliability while maintaining realistic
response distributions (KS similarity > 0.85). Additionally, these synthetic
respondents provide rich qualitative feedback explaining their ratings. This
framework enables scalable consumer research simulations while preserving
traditional survey metrics and interpretability.

Motivation: 传统RAG在复杂查询理解方面存在不足，基于强化学习的搜索代理虽然前景广阔但面临泛化和部署挑战。

Method: 采用模块化搜索代理，通过多步决策过程进行交互式推理和检索，使用强化学习训练以最大化检索质量。

Result: 实验表明QAgent在问答任务中表现优异，可作为即插即用模块在实际应用中部署。

Conclusion: QAgent通过专注于有效检索的策略，增强了LLM应用的泛化能力，为实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language tasks but are limited
by their static parametric knowledge, especially in knowledge-intensive task.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this by integrating external
information. However, (1) traditional RAG struggles with complex query
understanding, and (2) even search agents trained with reinforcement learning
(RL), despite their promise, still face generalization and deployment
challenges. To address these limitations, we propose QAgent, a unified agentic
RAG framework that employs a search agent for adaptive retrieval. This agent
optimizes its understanding of the query through interactive reasoning and
retrieval. To facilitate real-world application, we focus on modular search
agent for query understanding that are plug-and-play in complex systems.
Secifically, the agent follows a multi-step decision process trained with RL to
maximize retrieval quality and support accurate downstream answers. We further
analyze the strengths and weaknesses of end-to-end RL and propose a strategy
that focuses on effective retrieval, thereby enhancing generalization in LLM
applications. Experiments show QAgent excels at QA and serves as a
plug-and-play module for real-world deployment.

Motivation: 检测大型语言模型中的幻觉对其可信部署至关重要，现有不确定性驱动的检测框架存在局限，需要更有效的内部推理过程分析方法。

Method: 通过测量从多个模型输出和不同层导出的隐藏状态的有效秩来量化不确定性，基于表示的光谱分析提供可解释的语义变化洞察。

Result: 大量实验表明该方法能有效检测幻觉，并在各种场景中具有鲁棒泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM真实性检测提供了新范式，结合了理论优雅性和实践效率，证明了在内部和外部同时量化不确定性的必要性。

Abstract: Detecting hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) remains a
fundamental challenge for their trustworthy deployment. Going beyond basic
uncertainty-driven hallucination detection frameworks, we propose a simple yet
powerful method that quantifies uncertainty by measuring the effective rank of
hidden states derived from multiple model outputs and different layers.
Grounded in the spectral analysis of representations, our approach provides
interpretable insights into the model's internal reasoning process through
semantic variations, while requiring no extra knowledge or additional modules,
thus offering a combination of theoretical elegance and practical efficiency.
Meanwhile, we theoretically demonstrate the necessity of quantifying
uncertainty both internally (representations of a single response) and
externally (different responses), providing a justification for using
representations among different layers and responses from LLMs to detect
hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively
detects hallucinations and generalizes robustly across various scenarios,
contributing to a new paradigm of hallucination detection for LLM truthfulness.

Result: 在五个基准测试(BLiMP、BLiMP Supplement、EWoK、Winoground、VQA)上表现优于或与多模态基线相当。动态门控发现了可解释的模式，无需显式监督就能为内容词偏好视觉线索，为功能词偏好语言线索。

Conclusion: 尽管存在挑战约束的限制(如图像嵌入的信息瓶颈和数据集分割导致的训练不稳定)，动态门控被证明是高效多模态学习的强大工具，在严格约束下既提供可解释性又保持性能。

Abstract: Training vision-language models on cognitively-plausible amounts of data
requires rethinking how models integrate multimodal information. Within the
constraints of the Vision track for the BabyLM Challenge 2025, we propose a
lightweight decoder-based architecture with (1) token-wise dynamic gating for
adaptive fusion of linguistic and visual cues, (2) feature modulation and
channel attention to maximise the utility of limited visual information and (3)
auxiliary contrastive objectives for visual grounding. Evaluation on five
benchmarks (BLiMP, BLiMP Supplement, EWoK, Winoground and VQA) shows
competitive or superior performance to multimodal baselines. More notably, our
dynamic gate discovers interpretable patterns without explicit supervision,
favouring visual cues for content words and linguistic cues for function words.
While we identify limitations in the Challenge constraints, such as the
information bottleneck created by global image embeddings and training
instability from the dataset split, our findings establish dynamic gating as a
powerful tool for efficient multimodal learning, offering both interpretability
and performance even under severe constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在AutoML和Kaggle竞赛等机器学习工程场景中，LLM缺乏细粒度领域先验知识，现有方法无法充分利用历史轨迹和跨分支信息共享，限制了自我演进能力和搜索空间多样性。

Method: 结合领域知识库提供高质量先验指导，使用蒙特卡洛图搜索（MCGS）进行高效探索，MCGS在扩展阶段嵌入图结构以支持动态路径重组、历史轨迹重用和多解决方案融合。

Conclusion: AutoMLGen通过集成领域知识和图搜索策略，显著提升了机器学习工程任务的性能，证明了该方法在复杂编程场景中的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in general
programming tasks. However, in Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) scenarios
such as AutoML and Kaggle competitions, achieving high performance depends
heavily on expert intervention and repeated adjustments rather than simply
generating correct code. When applied directly to these tasks, LLMs often lack
fine-grained domain priors, and existing MLE approaches that use linear or
tree-structured searches limit knowledge transfer to adjacent hierarchical
links. As a result, they cannot leverage past full trajectories or share
information across branches, limiting self-evolving ability and search space
diversity. To address these limitations, we introduce AutoMLGen, an LLM-based
coding agent that integrates a domain knowledge base for high-quality prior
guidance and Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. MCGS
retains the tree-guided exploration of MCTS while embedding a graph structure
into the expansion stage to enable dynamic path reorganization, historical
trajectory reuse, and multi-solution fusion to support both self-evolution and
collaborative learning. Combined with fine-grained operator sets, this design
improves stability and accelerates convergence. Evaluation on the MLE-Bench
shows that AutoMLGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in numerous
dimensions, such as the average medal rate and the valid submission rate, under
a 12-hour budget (half the standard runtime). The code is available at

Motivation: 解决多轮交互任务中模型需要战略性地收集信息，知道何时停止收集并做出决策，避免过度思考或偏离正轨的问题

Method: 使用反事实轨迹对进行微调：一个轨迹在适当时候终止，另一个相同轨迹的微小修改版本不终止，通过言语推理训练LLM解释终止决策的合理性

Result: 在交互式医疗诊断和数学问题解决两个领域中，CaRT相比其他微调方法提高了信息收集效率和任务成功率

Conclusion: CaRT方法能有效教导LLMs在信息收集过程中知道何时终止，提高任务执行效率

Abstract: Many tasks require learned models to strategically gather relevant
information over multiple rounds of interaction before actually acting on a
task. Strategic information gathering requires models to know not only how to
effectively acquire information, but also when to stop gathering information
and make a decision, in order to avoid overthinking or getting derailed when
acting. In this paper, we formalize this problem and introduce Counterfactuals
and Reasoning for Termination (CaRT), an approach for teaching LLMs when to
stop seeking information. To appropriately learn when to terminate, CaRT
fine-tunes LLMs using counterfactual pairs of trajectories, one where
termination is appropriate and a minimally modified version of the same
trajectory where it is not. It trains the LLM to explain the rationale for the
termination decision in either case via verbal reasoning, and imbues this
capability into the base LLM via fine-tuning. We instantiate CaRT in two
domains: interactive medical diagnosis and math problem solving. In both
domains, we find that CaRT improves the efficiency of information gathering and
task success rate compared to other fine-tuning methods.

Motivation: 当前语言智能体主要依赖专家数据的监督微调，这种方法难以扩展且泛化能力差。专家演示仅涵盖狭窄的场景范围，暴露给智能体的环境多样性有限。需要一种介于模仿学习和完全经验驱动之间的实用方法。

Method: 提出了两种使用早期经验数据的策略：(1) 隐式世界建模，利用收集的状态将策略基于环境动态；(2) 自我反思，智能体从次优行动中学习以改进推理和决策。在八个多样化环境中进行了评估。

Result: 该方法在所有评估环境中一致提高了有效性和跨领域泛化能力。在具有可验证奖励的环境中，结果为后续强化学习提供了强有力的基础，表明早期经验是连接模仿学习和完全经验驱动智能体的实用桥梁。

Conclusion: 早期经验范式为解决语言智能体从自身经验中学习的问题提供了有效方法，显著提升了性能表现，并为后续强化学习奠定了良好基础。

Abstract: A long-term goal of language agents is to learn and improve through their own
experience, ultimately outperforming humans in complex, real-world tasks.
However, training agents from experience data with reinforcement learning
remains difficult in many environments, which either lack verifiable rewards
(e.g., websites) or require inefficient long-horizon rollouts (e.g., multi-turn
tool use). As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on
expert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This
limitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a
narrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment
diversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call
early experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where
the resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within
this paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world
modeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment
dynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal
actions to improve reasoning and decision-making. We evaluate across eight
diverse environments and multiple model families. Our approaches consistently
improve effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization, highlighting the value
of early experience. Moreover, in environments with verifiable rewards, our
results provide promising signals that early experience offers a strong
foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning, positioning it as a practical
bridge between imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型多模态模型在顺序微调过程中出现的灾难性遗忘问题，即学习新技能时丢失先前获得的能力。

Method: 在五个目标技能上进行顺序微调，同时在八个基准测试上监控通用能力。提出了两种简单的调优方法：(i)仅更新自注意力投影层，(ii)仅更新MLP的Gate&Up投影层而冻结Down投影层。

Result: 发现遗忘现象在后续阶段可以部分恢复，通过选择性更新特定层的方法能够在获得强目标性能的同时保持原有性能。

Conclusion: 识别出两种简单且鲁棒的调优方法，能够有效限制输出分布漂移，实现新技能学习与原有能力保持的平衡。

Abstract: How can we teach large multimodal models (LMMs) new skills without erasing
prior abilities? We study sequential fine-tuning on five target skills while
monitoring general ability on eight held-out benchmarks across three model
families. We observe that apparent "forgetting" on held-out tasks after narrow
fine-tuning can partly recover at later stages. We trace this behavior to a
measurable shift in the output token distribution, manifested through a simple
counting-bias probe that co-varies with forgetting. Guided by this picture, we
identify two simple, robust tuning recipes that learn strongly while limiting
drift: (i) updating only the self-attention projection layers, and (ii)
updating only the MLP Gate&Up while freezing the Down projection. Across models
and tasks, these choices deliver strong target gains while largely preserving
held-out performance. Code is available at
