### [1] [Enhancing the Quality of 3D Lunar Maps Using JAXA's Kaguya Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11817)
*Yumi Iwashita,Haakon Moe,Yang Cheng,Adnan Ansar,Georgios Georgakis,Adrian Stoica,Kazuto Nakashima,Ryo Kurazume,Jim Torresen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进Kaguya TC图像生成3D月球地图质量的方法，重点解决压缩引起的视差图噪声问题，提升未来月球任务的地形数据安全性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着全球月球探索活动加剧，对高质量3D月球地图的需求日益迫切，特别是NASA Endurance任务等长距离任务需要精确地形数据。Kaguya TC图像存在立体匹配误差和JPEG压缩伪影导致的海拔不准确问题。

Method: 分析Kaguya TC图像的压缩行为，识别系统性视差噪声模式（特别是在暗区），提出通过减少压缩图像视差图中的残留噪声来增强3D地图质量的方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的方法有效减少了海拔噪声，提高了地形数据的安全性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够显著改善从压缩Kaguya TC图像生成的3D月球地图质量，为未来月球任务提供更可靠的地形数据支持。

Abstract: As global efforts to explore the Moon intensify, the need for high-quality 3D
lunar maps becomes increasingly critical-particularly for long-distance
missions such as NASA's Endurance mission concept, in which a rover aims to
traverse 2,000 km across the South Pole-Aitken basin. Kaguya TC (Terrain
Camera) images, though globally available at 10 m/pixel, suffer from altitude
inaccuracies caused by stereo matching errors and JPEG-based compression
artifacts. This paper presents a method to improve the quality of 3D maps
generated from Kaguya TC images, focusing on mitigating the effects of
compression-induced noise in disparity maps. We analyze the compression
behavior of Kaguya TC imagery, and identify systematic disparity noise
patterns, especially in darker regions. In this paper, we propose an approach
to enhance 3D map quality by reducing residual noise in disparity images
derived from compressed images. Our experimental results show that the proposed
approach effectively reduces elevation noise, enhancing the safety and
reliability of terrain data for future lunar missions.

### [2] [Data or Language Supervision: What Makes CLIP Better than DINO?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11835)
*Yiming Liu,Yuhui Zhang,Dhruba Ghosh,Ludwig Schmidt,Serena Yeung-Levy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP在视觉语言模型中优于DINO的原因主要来自语言监督而非训练数据量，CLIP擅长捕捉高级语义特征，而DINO更关注低级视觉特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究CLIP在视觉语言模型中优于自监督模型DINO的原因，是源于语言监督还是更大的训练数据量。

Method: 在相同架构、数据集和训练配置下预训练CLIP和DINO，分析嵌入特征，并将它们集成到视觉语言模型中评估20个VQA基准。

Result: CLIP在文本密集型任务上表现优异，DINO在视觉中心任务上略胜一筹；语言监督变体带来的增益有限。

Conclusion: 语言监督使CLIP能够捕捉高级语义信息，这对视觉语言模型的性能至关重要，为视觉编码器设计提供了科学见解。

Abstract: CLIP outperforms self-supervised models like DINO as vision encoders for
vision-language models (VLMs), but it remains unclear whether this advantage
stems from CLIP's language supervision or its much larger training data. To
disentangle these factors, we pre-train CLIP and DINO under controlled settings
-- using the same architecture, dataset, and training configuration --
achieving similar ImageNet accuracy. Embedding analysis shows that CLIP
captures high-level semantics (e.g., object categories, text), while DINO is
more responsive to low-level features like colors and styles. When integrated
into VLMs and evaluated on 20 VQA benchmarks, CLIP excels at text-intensive
tasks, while DINO slightly outperforms on vision-centric ones. Variants of
language supervision (e.g., sigmoid loss, pre-trained language encoders) yield
limited gains. Our findings provide scientific insights into vision encoder
design and its impact on VLM performance.

### [3] [MammoDINO: Anatomically Aware Self-Supervision for Mammographic Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11883)
*Sicheng Zhou,Lei Wu,Cao Xiao,Parminder Bhatia,Taha Kass-Hout*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MammoDINO是一个用于乳腺X线摄影的自监督学习框架，在140万张乳腺图像上预训练，通过创新的数据增强和对比学习目标，在多个乳腺癌筛查任务中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督学习在通用视觉领域已取得显著进展，但在医学影像中应用有限，主要受限于数据不足和领域特定偏差。本文旨在为乳腺X线摄影开发一个有效的自监督学习框架。

Method: 提出了MammoDINO框架，包括：1）乳腺组织感知数据增强采样器，用于图像级和补丁级监督；2）跨切片对比学习目标，将3D DBT结构信息融入2D预训练；3）在140万张乳腺图像上进行预训练。

Result: 在多个乳腺癌筛查任务中达到最先进性能，并在五个基准数据集上表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MammoDINO为乳腺X线摄影提供了一个可扩展、无需标注的多用途计算机辅助诊断工具基础，有助于减轻放射科医生工作负担并提高乳腺癌筛查诊断效率。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has transformed vision encoder training in
general domains but remains underutilized in medical imaging due to limited
data and domain specific biases. We present MammoDINO, a novel SSL framework
for mammography, pretrained on 1.4 million mammographic images. To capture
clinically meaningful features, we introduce a breast tissue aware data
augmentation sampler for both image-level and patch-level supervision and a
cross-slice contrastive learning objective that leverages 3D digital breast
tomosynthesis (DBT) structure into 2D pretraining. MammoDINO achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multiple breast cancer screening tasks and
generalizes well across five benchmark datasets. It offers a scalable,
annotation-free foundation for multipurpose computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)
tools for mammogram, helping reduce radiologists' workload and improve
diagnostic efficiency in breast cancer screening.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个双模型框架，利用VideoLLaMA和Qwen2.5-VL的互补优势，通过任务特定优化来提升交通视频分析性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通视频分析需要复杂的视频理解能力来捕捉细粒度行为模式并生成全面描述以预防事故，现有方法存在任务干扰问题。

Method: 采用分离训练策略，让VideoLLaMA专门负责时序推理任务，Qwen2.5-VL专门负责视觉理解任务，避免任务间干扰。

Result: 在WTS数据集上，VideoLLaMA在时序推理上获得CIDEr得分1.1001，Qwen2.5-VL在视觉问答上达到60.80%准确率，在2025 AI City Challenge Track 2中获得S2得分45.7572，排名第10。

Conclusion: 分离训练策略比联合训练在VQA准确率上提升8.6%，同时保持描述质量，证明了任务特定优化的有效性。

Abstract: Traffic safety analysis requires complex video understanding to capture
fine-grained behavioral patterns and generate comprehensive descriptions for
accident prevention. In this work, we present a unique dual-model framework
that strategically utilizes the complementary strengths of VideoLLaMA and
Qwen2.5-VL through task-specific optimization to address this issue. The core
insight behind our approach is that separating training for captioning and
visual question answering (VQA) tasks minimizes task interference and allows
each model to specialize more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate
that VideoLLaMA is particularly effective in temporal reasoning, achieving a
CIDEr score of 1.1001, while Qwen2.5-VL excels in visual understanding with a
VQA accuracy of 60.80\%. Through extensive experiments on the WTS dataset, our
method achieves an S2 score of 45.7572 in the 2025 AI City Challenge Track 2,
placing 10th on the challenge leaderboard. Ablation studies validate that our
separate training strategy outperforms joint training by 8.6\% in VQA accuracy
while maintaining captioning quality.

### [5] [PanoTPS-Net: Panoramic Room Layout Estimation via Thin Plate Spline Transformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11992)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PanoTPS-Net是一个从单张全景图像估计房间3D布局的新模型，结合CNN和薄板样条变换，能有效处理立方体和非立方体布局。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确估计房间3D布局在机器人、增强现实和室内设计中有重要应用，需要能处理各种形状房间布局的方法。

Method: 采用两阶段架构：CNN提取特征并学习TPS变换参数，然后TPS变换层将参考布局变形为目标布局。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上表现优异，3DIoU值分别为85.49(PanoContext)、86.16(Stanford-2D3D)、81.76(Matterport3DLayout)、91.98(ZInD)。

Conclusion: 模型在房间布局估计中表现出高精度，证明了TPS变换与全景图像的兼容性，能鲁棒处理各种形状的布局。

Abstract: Accurately estimating the 3D layout of rooms is a crucial task in computer
vision, with potential applications in robotics, augmented reality, and
interior design. This paper proposes a novel model, PanoTPS-Net, to estimate
room layout from a single panorama image. Leveraging a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) and incorporating a Thin Plate Spline (TPS) spatial
transformation, the architecture of PanoTPS-Net is divided into two stages:
First, a convolutional neural network extracts the high-level features from the
input images, allowing the network to learn the spatial parameters of the TPS
transformation. Second, the TPS spatial transformation layer is generated to
warp a reference layout to the required layout based on the predicted
parameters. This unique combination empowers the model to properly predict room
layouts while also generalizing effectively to both cuboid and non-cuboid
layouts. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets and comparisons
with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method. The results underscore the model's accuracy in room layout estimation
and emphasize the compatibility between the TPS transformation and panorama
images. The robustness of the model in handling both cuboid and non-cuboid room
layout estimation is evident with a 3DIoU value of 85.49, 86.16, 81.76, and
91.98 on PanoContext, Stanford-2D3D, Matterport3DLayout, and ZInD datasets,
respectively. The source code is available at:

### [6] [Uncertainty Matters in Dynamic Gaussian Splatting for Monocular 4D Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12768)
*Fengzhi Guo,Chih-Chuan Hsu,Sihao Ding,Cheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: USplat4D是一个不确定性感知的动态高斯泼溅框架，通过估计每个高斯的时变不确定性并构建时空图进行优化，提升4D重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动态高斯泼溅模型对所有高斯基元进行统一优化，忽略了观测质量差异，导致遮挡下的运动漂移和极端视角下的合成质量下降。

Method: 引入时间变化的每个高斯不确定性估计，构建时空图进行不确定性感知优化，将可靠的运动线索传播到整个场景。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上的实验表明，显式建模不确定性持续改进动态高斯泼溅模型，在遮挡下产生更稳定的几何结构，在极端视角下实现高质量合成。

Conclusion: 不确定性感知是提升动态高斯泼溅性能的关键，USplat4D通过可靠运动线索传播有效解决了遮挡和极端视角下的重建问题。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular input is fundamentally
under-constrained, with ambiguities arising from occlusion and extreme novel
views. While dynamic Gaussian Splatting offers an efficient representation,
vanilla models optimize all Gaussian primitives uniformly, ignoring whether
they are well or poorly observed. This limitation leads to motion drifts under
occlusion and degraded synthesis when extrapolating to unseen views. We argue
that uncertainty matters: Gaussians with recurring observations across views
and time act as reliable anchors to guide motion, whereas those with limited
visibility are treated as less reliable. To this end, we introduce USplat4D, a
novel Uncertainty-aware dynamic Gaussian Splatting framework that propagates
reliable motion cues to enhance 4D reconstruction. Our key insight is to
estimate time-varying per-Gaussian uncertainty and leverages it to construct a
spatio-temporal graph for uncertainty-aware optimization. Experiments on
diverse real and synthetic datasets show that explicitly modeling uncertainty
consistently improves dynamic Gaussian Splatting models, yielding more stable
geometry under occlusion and high-quality synthesis at extreme viewpoints.

### [7] [Prompt-Guided Spatial Understanding with RGB-D Transformers for Fine-Grained Object Relation Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11996)
*Tanner Muturi,Blessing Agyei Kyem,Joshua Kofi Asamoah,Neema Jakisa Owor,Richard Dyzinela,Andrews Danyo,Yaw Adu-Gyamfi,Armstrong Aboah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对仓库环境的空间推理框架，通过将边界框坐标嵌入输入提示来增强空间理解，在AI City Challenge Track 3中取得第4名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模3D环境中视觉语言系统的空间推理挑战，包括场景杂乱、遮挡和精确空间理解需求，现有模型在这些环境中泛化能力不足。

Method: 将掩码维度（边界框坐标）直接嵌入输入提示，使模型能够推理对象几何和布局；在四个问题类别上进行微调；在训练集中向GPT响应添加规范化答案。

Result: 最终得分为73.0606，在公共排行榜上排名第4。

Conclusion: 结构化提示丰富和针对性优化在推进现实工业环境空间推理方面具有有效性。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in large-scale 3D environments such as warehouses remains a
significant challenge for vision-language systems due to scene clutter,
occlusions, and the need for precise spatial understanding. Existing models
often struggle with generalization in such settings, as they rely heavily on
local appearance and lack explicit spatial grounding. In this work, we
introduce a dedicated spatial reasoning framework for the Physical AI Spatial
Intelligence Warehouse dataset introduced in the Track 3 2025 AI City
Challenge. Our approach enhances spatial comprehension by embedding mask
dimensions in the form of bounding box coordinates directly into the input
prompts, enabling the model to reason over object geometry and layout. We
fine-tune the framework across four question categories namely: Distance
Estimation, Object Counting, Multi-choice Grounding, and Spatial Relation
Inference using task-specific supervision. To further improve consistency with
the evaluation system, normalized answers are appended to the GPT response
within the training set. Our comprehensive pipeline achieves a final score of
73.0606, placing 4th overall on the public leaderboard. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of structured prompt enrichment and targeted
optimization in advancing spatial reasoning for real-world industrial
environments.

### [8] [MVP4D: Multi-View Portrait Video Diffusion for Animatable 4D Avatars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12785)
*Felix Taubner,Ruihang Zhang,Mathieu Tuli,Sherwin Bahmani,David B. Lindell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MVP4D是一个基于视频扩散模型的数字人生成系统，能够从单张参考图像生成可动画化的多视角视频，并蒸馏为可实时渲染的4D虚拟化身。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统创建逼真数字人虚拟化身的过程昂贵耗时，现有单图生成方法在视角偏离参考图像时质量下降，缺乏多视角信息和明确3D表示的约束。

Method: 基于预训练视频扩散模型，从单张参考图像和目标表情生成360度多视角视频，然后将输出蒸馏为可实时渲染的4D虚拟化身。

Result: 相比先前方法，显著提升了生成虚拟化身的真实感、时间一致性和3D一致性。

Conclusion: MVP4D方法有效解决了单图生成数字人虚拟化身的视角偏差问题，实现了更高质量的4D虚拟化身生成。

Abstract: Digital human avatars aim to simulate the dynamic appearance of humans in
virtual environments, enabling immersive experiences across gaming, film,
virtual reality, and more. However, the conventional process for creating and
animating photorealistic human avatars is expensive and time-consuming,
requiring large camera capture rigs and significant manual effort from
professional 3D artists. With the advent of capable image and video generation
models, recent methods enable automatic rendering of realistic animated avatars
from a single casually captured reference image of a target subject. While
these techniques significantly lower barriers to avatar creation and offer
compelling realism, they lack constraints provided by multi-view information or
an explicit 3D representation. So, image quality and realism degrade when
rendered from viewpoints that deviate strongly from the reference image. Here,
we build a video model that generates animatable multi-view videos of digital
humans based on a single reference image and target expressions. Our model,
MVP4D, is based on a state-of-the-art pre-trained video diffusion model and
generates hundreds of frames simultaneously from viewpoints varying by up to
360 degrees around a target subject. We show how to distill the outputs of this
model into a 4D avatar that can be rendered in real-time. Our approach
significantly improves the realism, temporal consistency, and 3D consistency of
generated avatars compared to previous methods.

### [9] [Evaluating the Explainability of Vision Transformers in Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12021)
*Leili Barekatain,Ben Glocker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 评估不同Vision Transformer架构在医学影像中的可解释性，发现DINO结合Grad-CAM提供最忠实和局部化的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像中模型决策的可解释性直接影响临床信任和采用，但Vision Transformers的复杂注意力机制给可解释性带来挑战。

Method: 使用Gradient Attention Rollout和Grad-CAM评估ViT、DeiT、DINO和Swin Transformer在不同预训练策略下的可解释性，在血细胞分类和乳腺超声分类任务上进行定量和定性分析。

Result: DINO结合Grad-CAM在所有数据集中提供最忠实和局部化的解释。Grad-CAM产生类别区分性和空间精确的热图，而Gradient Attention Rollout产生更分散的激活。即使在错误分类情况下，DINO与Grad-CAM也能突出显示误导模型的临床相关形态特征。

Conclusion: 通过提高模型透明度，这项研究支持将Vision Transformers可靠且可解释地集成到关键医学诊断工作流程中。

Abstract: Understanding model decisions is crucial in medical imaging, where
interpretability directly impacts clinical trust and adoption. Vision
Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in
diagnostic imaging; however, their complex attention mechanisms pose challenges
to explainability. This study evaluates the explainability of different Vision
Transformer architectures and pre-training strategies - ViT, DeiT, DINO, and
Swin Transformer - using Gradient Attention Rollout and Grad-CAM. We conduct
both quantitative and qualitative analyses on two medical imaging tasks:
peripheral blood cell classification and breast ultrasound image
classification. Our findings indicate that DINO combined with Grad-CAM offers
the most faithful and localized explanations across datasets. Grad-CAM
consistently produces class-discriminative and spatially precise heatmaps,
while Gradient Attention Rollout yields more scattered activations. Even in
misclassification cases, DINO with Grad-CAM highlights clinically relevant
morphological features that appear to have misled the model. By improving model
transparency, this research supports the reliable and explainable integration
of ViTs into critical medical diagnostic workflows.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出APGNet网络用于水下伪装目标检测，通过自适应先验引导机制解决水下图像退化和海洋生物伪装问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下图像存在对比度低、颜色失真等退化问题，且海洋生物具有天然伪装特性，传统图像增强和陆地COD方法难以适应水下环境

Method: 使用MSRCR算法进行数据增强，设计扩展感受野模块和多尺度渐进解码器，提出自适应先验引导机制融合位置和边界先验

Result: 在两个公开MAS数据集上的实验表明，APGNet在多种评估指标上优于15种最先进方法

Conclusion: APGNet能有效解决水下伪装目标检测的挑战，为海洋生态研究和资源勘探提供有力工具

Abstract: Detecting camouflaged objects in underwater environments is crucial for
marine ecological research and resource exploration. However, existing methods
face two key challenges: underwater image degradation, including low contrast
and color distortion, and the natural camouflage of marine organisms.
Traditional image enhancement techniques struggle to restore critical features
in degraded images, while camouflaged object detection (COD) methods developed
for terrestrial scenes often fail to adapt to underwater environments due to
the lack of consideration for underwater optical characteristics.
  To address these issues, we propose APGNet, an Adaptive Prior-Guided Network,
which integrates a Siamese architecture with a novel prior-guided mechanism to
enhance robustness and detection accuracy. First, we employ the Multi-Scale
Retinex with Color Restoration (MSRCR) algorithm for data augmentation,
generating illumination-invariant images to mitigate degradation effects.
Second, we design an Extended Receptive Field (ERF) module combined with a
Multi-Scale Progressive Decoder (MPD) to capture multi-scale contextual
information and refine feature representations. Furthermore, we propose an
adaptive prior-guided mechanism that hierarchically fuses position and boundary
priors by embedding spatial attention in high-level features for coarse
localization and using deformable convolution to refine contours in low-level
features.
  Extensive experimental results on two public MAS datasets demonstrate that
our proposed method APGNet outperforms 15 state-of-art methods under widely
used evaluation metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于扩散的视频编辑方法在结构保留任务上表现良好，但在结构可变编辑方面存在时间不一致、主体身份漂移和需要人工干预等问题。

Method: 利用姿态和位置先验从源视频学习通用运动表示，生成既保持原始运动又允许结构和语义灵活性的新视频。

Result: 定性和定量评估都表明该方法优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VidMP3通过运动表示学习解决了视频编辑中的关键挑战，为创作者提供了更大的灵活性。

Abstract: Motion-preserved video editing is crucial for creators, particularly in
scenarios that demand flexibility in both the structure and semantics of
swapped objects. Despite its potential, this area remains underexplored.
Existing diffusion-based editing methods excel in structure-preserving tasks,
using dense guidance signals to ensure content integrity. While some recent
methods attempt to address structure-variable editing, they often suffer from
issues such as temporal inconsistency, subject identity drift, and the need for
human intervention. To address these challenges, we introduce VidMP3, a novel
approach that leverages pose and position priors to learn a generalized motion
representation from source videos. Our method enables the generation of new
videos that maintain the original motion while allowing for structural and
semantic flexibility. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate
the superiority of our approach over existing methods. The code will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/sandeep-sm/VidMP3.

Abstract: The major challenge in today's computer vision scenario is the availability
of good quality labeled data. In a field of study like image classification,
where data is of utmost importance, we need to find more reliable methods which
can overcome the scarcity of data to produce results comparable to previous
benchmark results. In most cases, obtaining labeled data is very difficult
because of the high cost of human labor and in some cases impossible. The
purpose of this paper is to discuss Domain Adaptation and various methods to
implement it. The main idea is to use a model trained on a particular dataset
to predict on data from a different domain of the same kind, for example - a
model trained on paintings of airplanes predicting on real images of airplanes

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved audio-driven
human video generation, surpassing traditional methods in both quality and
controllability. However, existing approaches still face challenges in lip-sync
accuracy, temporal coherence for long video generation, and multi-character
animation. In this work, we propose a diffusion transformer (DiT)-based
framework for generating lifelike talking videos of arbitrary length, and
introduce a training-free method for multi-character audio-driven animation.
First, we employ a LoRA-based training strategy combined with a position shift
inference approach, which enables efficient long video generation while
preserving the capabilities of the foundation model. Moreover, we combine
partial parameter updates with reward feedback to enhance both lip
synchronization and natural body motion. Finally, we propose a training-free
approach, Mask Classifier-Free Guidance (Mask-CFG), for multi-character
animation, which requires no specialized datasets or model modifications and
supports audio-driven animation for three or more characters. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving high-quality, temporally coherent, and multi-character
audio-driven video generation in a simple, efficient, and cost-effective
manner.

### [15] [An Adaptive Edge-Guided Dual-Network Framework for Fast QR Code Motion Deblurring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12098)
*Jianping Li,Dongyang Guo,Wenjie Li,Wei Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于QR码去模糊的自适应双网络方法，包含EG-Restormer处理严重模糊和LENet处理轻度模糊，通过边缘引导注意力块嵌入显式边缘先验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法很少显式利用QR码高度结构化的边缘模式先验，而QR码去模糊的关键目标是确保成功解码而非感知质量。

Method: 提出边缘引导注意力块(EGAB)将显式边缘先验嵌入Transformer架构，基于此构建EG-Restormer处理严重模糊；设计轻量级LENet处理轻度模糊；整合为自适应双网络(ADNet)根据模糊程度动态选择网络。

Result: EG-Restormer和ADNet在严重模糊QR码的解码率上达到最先进性能，同时保持有竞争力的速度。

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式利用QR码的结构化边缘先验，有效提升了模糊QR码的解码成功率，特别适合资源受限的移动设备应用。

Abstract: Unlike general image deblurring that prioritizes perceptual quality, QR code
deblurring focuses on ensuring successful decoding. QR codes are characterized
by highly structured patterns with sharp edges, a robust prior for restoration.
Yet existing deep learning methods rarely exploit these priors explicitly. To
address this gap, we propose the Edge-Guided Attention Block (EGAB), which
embeds explicit edge priors into a Transformer architecture. Based on EGAB, we
develop Edge-Guided Restormer (EG-Restormer), an effective network that
significantly boosts the decoding rate of severely blurred QR codes. For mildly
blurred inputs, we design the Lightweight and Efficient Network (LENet) for
fast deblurring. We further integrate these two networks into an Adaptive
Dual-network (ADNet), which dynamically selects the suitable network based on
input blur severity, making it ideal for resource-constrained mobile devices.
Extensive experiments show that our EG-Restormer and ADNet achieve
state-of-the-art performance with a competitive speed. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用平面结构生成精确深度图的方法，通过几何引导增强3D场景重建，在观察和未观察区域都能实现高质量重建，并支持单视图输入和未配准视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏可靠的几何监督，难以在观察区域产生高质量重建，更不用说未观察区域；同时缺乏有效机制来缓解生成图像中的多视角不一致性，导致严重的形状-外观模糊和场景几何质量下降。

Method: 利用平面结构生成精确度量尺度深度图，在生成流程中融入几何引导来改进可见性掩码估计、指导新视角选择，并使用视频扩散模型增强多视角一致性。

Result: 在Replica、ScanNet++和DeepBlending数据集上的实验表明，该方法在几何和外观重建方面持续优于现有基线，特别是在未观察区域。支持单视图输入和未配准视频，在室内外场景中具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 准确几何是有效利用生成模型增强3D场景重建的基本前提，所提出的几何引导方法能够实现准确一致的场景补全，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in leveraging generative prior from pre-trained
diffusion models for 3D scene reconstruction, existing methods still face two
critical limitations. First, due to the lack of reliable geometric supervision,
they struggle to produce high-quality reconstructions even in observed regions,
let alone in unobserved areas. Second, they lack effective mechanisms to
mitigate multi-view inconsistencies in the generated images, leading to severe
shape-appearance ambiguities and degraded scene geometry. In this paper, we
identify accurate geometry as the fundamental prerequisite for effectively
exploiting generative models to enhance 3D scene reconstruction. We first
propose to leverage the prevalence of planar structures to derive accurate
metric-scale depth maps, providing reliable supervision in both observed and
unobserved regions. Furthermore, we incorporate this geometry guidance
throughout the generative pipeline to improve visibility mask estimation, guide
novel view selection, and enhance multi-view consistency when inpainting with
video diffusion models, resulting in accurate and consistent scene completion.
Extensive experiments on Replica, ScanNet++, and DeepBlending show that our
method consistently outperforms existing baselines in both geometry and
appearance reconstruction, particularly for unobserved regions. Moreover, our
method naturally supports single-view inputs and unposed videos, with strong
generalizability in both indoor and outdoor scenarios with practical real-world
applicability. The project page is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了判别式表示学习(DRL)框架，通过增量并行适配器(IPA)网络和分离锚点监督(DAS)解决非排练类增量学习中的模型复杂度、表示漂移和优化不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决预训练模型在非排练类增量学习中的三个核心挑战：模型复杂度增长、表示漂移不平稳、阶段优化与全局推理不一致。

Method: 使用增量并行适配器(IPA)网络，在预训练模型基础上学习轻量级适配器，通过传输门实现表示能力的继承；设计分离锚点监督(DAS)分别约束正负样本与虚拟锚点的比较。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，DRL在整个类增量学习过程中始终优于其他最先进方法，同时在训练和推理阶段保持高效率。

Conclusion: DRL框架有效解决了类增量学习中的关键挑战，通过IPA网络和DAS机制实现了平稳的表示迁移和一致的全局推理性能。

Abstract: With the excellent representation capabilities of Pre-Trained Models (PTMs),
remarkable progress has been made in non-rehearsal Class-Incremental Learning
(CIL) research. However, it remains an extremely challenging task due to three
conundrums: increasingly large model complexity, non-smooth representation
shift during incremental learning and inconsistency between stage-wise
sub-problem optimization and global inference. In this work, we propose the
Discriminative Representation Learning (DRL) framework to specifically address
these challenges. To conduct incremental learning effectively and yet
efficiently, the DRL's network, called Incremental Parallel Adapter (IPA)
network, is built upon a PTM and increasingly augments the model by learning a
lightweight adapter with a small amount of parameter learning overhead in each
incremental stage. The adapter is responsible for adapting the model to new
classes, it can inherit and propagate the representation capability from the
current model through parallel connection between them by a transfer gate. As a
result, this design guarantees a smooth representation shift between different
incremental stages. Furthermore, to alleviate inconsistency and enable
comparable feature representations across incremental stages, we design the
Decoupled Anchor Supervision (DAS). It decouples constraints of positive and
negative samples by respectively comparing them with the virtual anchor. This
decoupling promotes discriminative representation learning and aligns the
feature spaces learned at different stages, thereby narrowing the gap between
stage-wise local optimization over a subset of data and global inference across
all classes. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks reveal that our DRL
consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods throughout the entire
CIL period while maintaining high efficiency in both training and inference
phases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预训练扩散引导方法依赖显式退化先验或全局统计指导，难以处理局部伪影或人脸颜色问题，需要更有效的区域控制修复方法。

Method: 使用预训练扩散模型在弱引导下生成伪参考人脸，通过人脸解析图和划痕掩码进行选择性修复，采用分阶段监督：结构引导贯穿去噪过程，颜色细化在后期步骤进行。

Result: 构建了包含300张真实老照片的VintageFace基准数据集，SSDiff在感知质量、保真度和区域可控性方面优于现有GAN和扩散方法。

Conclusion: SSDiff方法通过自监督选择性引导扩散实现了对老照片人脸的有效修复，在结构保持和颜色恢复方面具有优势，为复杂退化场景提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Old-photo face restoration poses significant challenges due to compounded
degradations such as breakage, fading, and severe blur. Existing pre-trained
diffusion-guided methods either rely on explicit degradation priors or global
statistical guidance, which struggle with localized artifacts or face color. We
propose Self-Supervised Selective-Guided Diffusion (SSDiff), which leverages
pseudo-reference faces generated by a pre-trained diffusion model under weak
guidance. These pseudo-labels exhibit structurally aligned contours and natural
colors, enabling region-specific restoration via staged supervision: structural
guidance applied throughout the denoising process and color refinement in later
steps, aligned with the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion. By incorporating
face parsing maps and scratch masks, our method selectively restores breakage
regions while avoiding identity mismatch. We further construct VintageFace, a
300-image benchmark of real old face photos with varying degradation levels.
SSDiff outperforms existing GAN-based and diffusion-based methods in perceptual
quality, fidelity, and regional controllability. Code link:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索增强图像生成系统的广泛应用引发了对私有图像数据集未授权使用的担忧，传统数字水印方法在该系统中无法有效工作

Method: 利用视觉语言模型合成与原始数据集视觉一致的哨兵图像，通过随机生成的字符序列作为检索密钥进行保护验证

Result: 实验结果表明ImageSentinel能有效检测未授权的数据集使用，同时保持授权应用的生成质量

Conclusion: ImageSentinel为解决RAIG系统中视觉数据集保护问题提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Retrieval-Augmented Image Generation (RAIG) has
raised significant concerns about the unauthorized use of private image
datasets. While these systems have shown remarkable capabilities in enhancing
generation quality through reference images, protecting visual datasets from
unauthorized use in such systems remains a challenging problem. Traditional
digital watermarking approaches face limitations in RAIG systems, as the
complex feature extraction and recombination processes fail to preserve
watermark signals during generation. To address these challenges, we propose
ImageSentinel, a novel framework for protecting visual datasets in RAIG. Our
framework synthesizes sentinel images that maintain visual consistency with the
original dataset. These sentinels enable protection verification through
randomly generated character sequences that serve as retrieval keys. To ensure
seamless integration, we leverage vision-language models to generate the
sentinel images. Experimental results demonstrate that ImageSentinel
effectively detects unauthorized dataset usage while preserving generation
quality for authorized applications. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种约束优化方法来设计实用的压缩单光子3D成像编码函数，通过梯度下降联合优化照明和编码矩阵，在硬件约束下显著优于传统编码设计


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单光子相机在飞行时间3D成像中面临硬件限制（系统带宽、最大激光功率、传感器数据速率等），压缩直方图虽然解决了数据速率问题，但在实际照明硬件约束下表现不佳

Method: 使用梯度下降联合优化照明和编码矩阵（即编码函数），确保符合硬件约束条件

Result: 在广泛模拟中，该方法在带宽和峰值功率约束下始终优于传统编码设计，特别是在峰值功率受限系统中优势更明显，并能适应任意参数化脉冲响应

Conclusion: 该方法为压缩单光子3D成像提供了实用的编码函数设计，能够有效应对实际硬件约束

Abstract: Single-photon cameras are becoming increasingly popular in time-of-flight 3D
imaging because they can time-tag individual photons with extreme resolution.
However, their performance is susceptible to hardware limitations, such as
system bandwidth, maximum laser power, sensor data rates, and in-sensor memory
and compute resources. Compressive histograms were recently introduced as a
solution to the challenge of data rates through an online in-sensor compression
of photon timestamp data. Although compressive histograms work within limited
in-sensor memory and computational resources, they underperform when subjected
to real-world illumination hardware constraints. To address this, we present a
constrained optimization approach for designing practical coding functions for
compressive single-photon 3D imaging. Using gradient descent, we jointly
optimize an illumination and coding matrix (i.e., the coding functions) that
adheres to hardware constraints. We show through extensive simulations that our
coding functions consistently outperform traditional coding designs under both
bandwidth and peak power constraints. This advantage is particularly pronounced
in systems constrained by peak power. Finally, we show that our approach adapts
to arbitrary parameterized impulse responses by evaluating it on a real-world
system with a non-ideal impulse response function.

Motivation: 当前开源视觉描述模型与商业模型存在较大性能差距，限制了数据合成等应用。需要开发一种能够利用开源模型实现高质量视觉描述的方法。

Method: 提出CapFlow多智能体协作工作流，通过整合多个开源模型来生成高质量视觉描述。利用该工作流作为数据合成器，大规模生成图像和视频描述数据，然后通过微调训练出MetaCaptioner模型。

Conclusion: CapFlow和MetaCaptioner为未来多模态研究提供了强大且经济高效的视觉描述解决方案，能够促进相关应用的发展。

Abstract: Generalist visual captioning goes beyond a simple appearance description
task, but requires integrating a series of visual cues into a caption and
handling various visual domains. In this task, current open-source models
present a large performance gap with commercial ones, which limits various
applications such as data synthesis. To bridge the gap, this paper proposes
CapFlow, a novel multi-agent collaboration workflow. CapFlow demonstrates for
the first time that, by capitalizing on open-source models, it is possible to
achieve caption quality on par with GPT-4.1 in various domains with an 89.5%
reduction in costs. By leveraging CapFlow as the data synthesizer, we produce
high-quality visual captions from image and video domains at scale, and obtain
a generalist visual captioner via fine-tuning, namely MetaCaptioner. Through
extensive experiments, we show that MetaCaptioner not only achieves comparable
captioning capabilities with commercial models but also reaches top-tier
multimodal performance in the open-source community. We hope CapFlow and
MetaCaptioner can benefit future multimodal research by providing a strong and
cost-effective visual captioning solution.

Method: FedHUG框架包含：(1)最小偏差聚合模块动态调整聚合权重处理多域异构非IID特征；(2)全局分布感知学习控制器参数化标签分布并动态操控客户端训练策略。

Result: 在RGB视频和毫米波雷达的生理参数估计中，该方法优于现有最先进技术。

Conclusion: FedHUG框架有效解决了联邦无监督域泛化问题，为隐私保护的远程生理测量提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Remote physiological measurement gained wide attention, while it requires
collecting users' privacy-sensitive information, and existing contactless
measurements still rely on labeled client data. This presents challenges when
we want to further update real-world deployed models with numerous user data
lacking labels. To resolve these challenges, we instantiate a new protocol
called Federated Unsupervised Domain Generalization (FUDG) in this work.
Subsequently, the \textbf{Fed}erated \textbf{H}eterogeneous
\textbf{U}nsupervised \textbf{G}eneralization (\textbf{FedHUG}) framework is
proposed and consists of: (1) Minimal Bias Aggregation module dynamically
adjusts aggregation weights based on prior-driven bias evaluation to cope with
heterogeneous non-IID features from multiple domains. (2) The Global
Distribution-aware Learning Controller parameterizes the label distribution and
dynamically manipulates client-specific training strategies, thereby mitigating
the server-client label distribution skew and long-tail issue. The proposal
shows superior performance across state-of-the-art techniques in estimation
with either RGB video or mmWave radar. The code will be released.

TL;DR: 提出KFF方法，通过类感知域知识融合与分裂解决持续测试时适应中的灾难性遗忘问题，动态积累判别性历史知识


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CTTA方法通过恢复初始模型或重用历史模型来减少灾难性遗忘，但会导致新知识学习不足和有害历史知识干扰，造成性能下降

Method: 设计域知识分裂模块从配对类感知域提示池中自适应分离新域知识，以及域知识融合模块以最小成本将分裂的新知识合并到现有知识池中

Result: 在ImageNet-C数据集上的广泛实验验证了所提方法相对于其他方法的有效性

Conclusion: KFF方法通过知识融合与分裂机制有效解决了CTTA中的知识积累和兼容性问题

Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to quickly fine-tune the model
during the test phase so that it can adapt to multiple unknown downstream
domain distributions without pre-acquiring downstream domain data. To this end,
existing advanced CTTA methods mainly reduce the catastrophic forgetting of
historical knowledge caused by irregular switching of downstream domain data by
restoring the initial model or reusing historical models. However, these
methods are usually accompanied by serious insufficient learning of new
knowledge and interference from potentially harmful historical knowledge,
resulting in severe performance degradation. To this end, we propose a
class-aware domain Knowledge Fusion and Fission method for continual test-time
adaptation, called KFF, which adaptively expands and merges class-aware domain
knowledge in old and new domains according to the test-time data from different
domains, where discriminative historical knowledge can be dynamically
accumulated. Specifically, considering the huge domain gap within streaming
data, a domain Knowledge FIssion (KFI) module is designed to adaptively
separate new domain knowledge from a paired class-aware domain prompt pool,
alleviating the impact of negative knowledge brought by old domains that are
distinct from the current domain. Besides, to avoid the cumulative computation
and storage overheads from continuously fissioning new knowledge, a domain
Knowledge FUsion (KFU) module is further designed to merge the fissioned new
knowledge into the existing knowledge pool with minimal cost, where a greedy
knowledge dynamic merging strategy is designed to improve the compatibility of
new and old knowledge while keeping the computational efficiency. Extensive
experiments on the ImageNet-C dataset verify the effectiveness of our proposed
method against other methods.

Result: 在腹部MRI和CT数据集上的广泛实验显示，DPL在一次性医学图像分割中取得了显著改进，建立了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: DPL通过将原型建模为概率分布并利用扩散过程进行特征空间探索，有效解决了医学图像分割中因数据有限和解剖变异带来的原型表示挑战。

Abstract: One-shot medical image segmentation faces fundamental challenges in prototype
representation due to limited annotated data and significant anatomical
variability across patients. Traditional prototype-based methods rely on
deterministic averaging of support features, creating brittle representations
that fail to capture intra-class diversity essential for robust generalization.
This work introduces Diffusion Prototype Learning (DPL), a novel framework that
reformulates prototype construction through diffusion-based feature space
exploration. DPL models one-shot prototypes as learnable probability
distributions, enabling controlled generation of diverse yet semantically
coherent prototype variants from minimal labeled data. The framework operates
through three core innovations: (1) a diffusion-based prototype enhancement
module that transforms single support prototypes into diverse variant sets via
forward-reverse diffusion processes, (2) a spatial-aware conditioning mechanism
that leverages geometric properties derived from prototype feature statistics,
and (3) a conservative fusion strategy that preserves prototype fidelity while
maximizing representational diversity. DPL ensures training-inference
consistency by using the same diffusion enhancement and fusion pipeline in both
phases. This process generates enhanced prototypes that serve as the final
representations for similarity calculations, while the diffusion process itself
acts as a regularizer. Extensive experiments on abdominal MRI and CT datasets
demonstrate significant improvements respectively, establishing new
state-of-the-art performance in one-shot medical image segmentation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种状态空间提示（SSP）方法，通过帧内聚集和帧间扩散模块来聚合和传播视频中的关键时空信息，显著提升了视频理解的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的预训练状态空间模型在视频分类中虽然效率高，但顺序压缩的视觉提示令牌无法有效捕捉视频的空间和时间上下文信息，限制了空间信息在帧内和时间信息在帧间的有效传播。

Method: 设计了帧内聚集（IFG）模块来聚合每帧内的空间关键信息，以及帧间扩散（IFS）模块来传播不同帧间的判别性时空信息，通过自适应平衡和压缩帧内和帧间的关键时空信息来互补传播判别性信息。

Result: 在四个视频基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，SSP方法平均比现有SOTA方法性能提升2.76%，同时减少了微调参数的开销。

Conclusion: SSP方法通过有效聚合和传播视频中的关键时空信息，显著提升了视频理解的性能，同时保持了参数效率。

Abstract: Recently, pre-trained state space models have shown great potential for video
classification, which sequentially compresses visual tokens in videos with
linear complexity, thereby improving the processing efficiency of video data
while maintaining high performance. To apply powerful pre-trained models to
downstream tasks, prompt learning is proposed to achieve efficient downstream
task adaptation with only a small number of fine-tuned parameters. However, the
sequentially compressed visual prompt tokens fail to capture the spatial and
temporal contextual information in the video, thus limiting the effective
propagation of spatial information within a video frame and temporal
information between frames in the state compression model and the extraction of
discriminative information. To tackle the above issue, we proposed a State
Space Prompting (SSP) method for video understanding, which combines
intra-frame and inter-frame prompts to aggregate and propagate key
spatiotemporal information in the video. Specifically, an Intra-Frame Gathering
(IFG) module is designed to aggregate spatial key information within each
frame. Besides, an Inter-Frame Spreading (IFS) module is designed to spread
discriminative spatio-temporal information across different frames. By
adaptively balancing and compressing key spatio-temporal information within and
between frames, our SSP effectively propagates discriminative information in
videos in a complementary manner. Extensive experiments on four video benchmark
datasets verify that our SSP significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods by
2.76% on average while reducing the overhead of fine-tuning parameters.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose UniGS, a unified map representation and

on 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our framework integrates a CUDA-accelerated
rasterization pipeline capable of rendering photo-realistic RGB images,
geometrically accurate depth maps, consistent surface normals, and semantic
logits simultaneously. We redesign the rasterization to render depth via
differentiable ray-ellipsoid intersection rather than using Gaussian centers,
enabling effective optimization of rotation and scale attribute through
analytic depth gradients. Furthermore, we derive the analytic gradient
formulation for surface normal rendering, ensuring geometric consistency among
reconstructed 3D scenes. To improve computational and storage efficiency, we
introduce a learnable attribute that enables differentiable pruning of
Gaussians with minimal contribution during training. Quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy
across all modalities, validating the efficacy of our geometry-aware paradigm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 完全监督的3D实例分割需要密集的点级标注，成本高昂。虽然边界框标注更易获取，但在重叠区域存在歧义。现有两阶段方法训练复杂且无法端到端优化。

Method: 采用师生框架，教师模型作为伪标签生成器，通过指数移动平均更新。引入基于实例中心的查询精炼来改进位置查询定位，并设计查询一致性损失和掩码特征一致性损失来对齐预测与伪掩码。

Conclusion: BEEP3D提供了一种有效的端到端解决方案，能够在降低标注成本的同时实现高质量的3D实例分割。

Abstract: 3D instance segmentation is crucial for understanding complex 3D
environments, yet fully supervised methods require dense point-level
annotations, resulting in substantial annotation costs and labor overhead. To
mitigate this, box-level annotations have been explored as a weaker but more
scalable form of supervision. However, box annotations inherently introduce
ambiguity in overlapping regions, making accurate point-to-instance assignment
challenging. Recent methods address this ambiguity by generating pseudo-masks
through training a dedicated pseudo-labeler in an additional training stage.
However, such two-stage pipelines often increase overall training time and
complexity, hinder end-to-end optimization. To overcome these challenges, we
propose BEEP3D-Box-supervised End-to-End Pseudo-mask generation for 3D instance
segmentation. BEEP3D adopts a student-teacher framework, where the teacher
model serves as a pseudo-labeler and is updated by the student model via an
Exponential Moving Average. To better guide the teacher model to generate
precise pseudo-masks, we introduce an instance center-based query refinement
that enhances position query localization and leverages features near instance
centers. Additionally, we design two novel losses-query consistency loss and
masked feature consistency loss-to align semantic and geometric signals between
predictions and pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and S3DIS
datasets demonstrate that BEEP3D achieves competitive or superior performance
compared to state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods while remaining
computationally efficient.

Conclusion: 视觉注意力对齐是提升学生模型视觉感知能力的关键，CompoDistill框架有效解决了现有知识蒸馏方法的局限性。

Abstract: Recently, efficient Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained
significant attention as a solution to their high computational complexity,
making them more practical for real-world applications. In this regard, the
knowledge distillation (KD) approach has emerged as a promising alternative,
which transfers the rich visual and linguistic knowledge from a larger model
(teacher) to a smaller model (student). However, we observe that existing KD
methods struggle to effectively distill the teacher MLLM's rich visual
perception abilities to the student, a challenge that has been largely
overlooked in previous studies. Through a systematic analysis, we identify
visual attention misalignment between student and teacher as the main cause of
this issue. Based on this insight, we propose CompoDistill, a novel KD
framework that explicitly aligns the student's visual attention with that of
the teacher to enhance the student's visual perception abilities. Our extensive
experiments show that CompoDistill significantly improves performance on
compositional reasoning tasks that require visual perception abilities while
maintaining strong performance on visual question answering tasks, as done in
existing studies. Furthermore, CompoDistill demonstrates effectiveness with a
more advanced backbone, highlighting its generalizability.

Conclusion: 基于视觉语言模型的分层推理是事故分析和安全关键交通事件理解的可行方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving have been enabled by
training on diverse large-scale driving datasets, yet autonomous driving models
still struggle in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. The COOOL benchmark
targets this gap by encouraging hazard understanding beyond closed taxonomies,
and the 2COOOL challenge extends it to generating human-interpretable incident
reports. We present a hierarchical reasoning framework for incident report
generation from dashcam videos that integrates frame-level captioning, incident
frame detection, and fine-grained reasoning within vision-language models
(VLMs). We further improve factual accuracy and readability through model
ensembling and a Blind A/B Scoring selection protocol. On the official 2COOOL
open leaderboard, our method ranks 2nd among 29 teams and achieves the best
CIDEr-D score, producing accurate and coherent incident narratives. These
results indicate that hierarchical reasoning with VLMs is a promising direction
for accident analysis and for broader understanding of safety-critical traffic
events. The implementation and code are available at

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI, particularly in computer vision (CV), offer
new opportunities to optimize workflows across industries, including logistics
and manufacturing. However, many AI applications are limited by a lack of
expertise and resources, which forces a reliance on general-purpose models.
Success with these models often requires domain-specific data for fine-tuning,
which can be costly and inefficient. Thus, using synthetic data for fine-tuning
is a popular, cost-effective alternative to gathering real-world data. This
work investigates the impact of synthetic data on the performance of object
detection models, compared to models trained on real-world data only,
specifically within the domain of warehouse logistics. To this end, we examined
the impact of synthetic data generated using the NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator
tool on the effectiveness of object detection models in real-world scenarios.
It comprises experiments focused on pallet detection in a warehouse setting,
utilizing both real and various synthetic dataset generation strategies. Our
findings provide valuable insights into the practical applications of synthetic
image data in computer vision, suggesting that a balanced integration of
synthetic and real data can lead to robust and efficient object detection
models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DIANet双流框架，利用相位感知动态图像分别编码微表情的起始-顶点和顶点-结束阶段，通过交叉注意力融合模块自适应整合特征，在多个基准数据集上优于传统单相位方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情识别面临挑战，因为面部线索细微短暂且标注数据有限。传统动态图像方法忽略了微表情不同时间阶段的独特特征，需要更精细的相位建模。

Method: DIANet双流框架：一个流编码起始到顶点阶段，另一个流捕获顶点到结束阶段，每个流使用专用CNN处理，通过交叉注意力融合模块自适应整合特征。

Result: 在CASME-II、SAMM和MMEW三个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法持续优于传统的单相位动态图像方法。

Conclusion: 明确建模时间相位信息对微表情识别至关重要，为推进该领域提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Micro-expressions are brief, involuntary facial movements that typically last
less than half a second and often reveal genuine emotions. Accurately
recognizing these subtle expressions is critical for applications in
psychology, security, and behavioral analysis. However, micro-expression
recognition (MER) remains a challenging task due to the subtle and transient
nature of facial cues and the limited availability of annotated data. While
dynamic image (DI) representations have been introduced to summarize temporal
motion into a single frame, conventional DI-based methods often overlook the
distinct characteristics of different temporal phases within a
micro-expression. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel
dual-stream framework, DIANet, which leverages phase-aware dynamic images - one
encoding the onset-to-apex phase and the other capturing the apex-to-offset
phase. Each stream is processed by a dedicated convolutional neural network,
and a cross-attention fusion module is employed to adaptively integrate
features from both streams based on their contextual relevance. Extensive
experiments conducted on three benchmark MER datasets (CASME-II, SAMM, and
MMEW) demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms
conventional single-phase DI-based approaches. The results highlight the
importance of modeling temporal phase information explicitly and suggest a
promising direction for advancing MER.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模仿学习泛化能力差，强化学习样本效率低且收敛不稳定，需要结合两者优势。

Method: 提出竞争性双策略框架，让IL和RL智能体在训练中交互，通过竞争机制促进知识交换并避免梯度冲突。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上实验显示碰撞率降低18%，泛化能力更强，长尾场景表现更好。

Conclusion: CoIRL-AD框架有效结合IL和RL，超越传统两阶段方法，显著提升自动驾驶性能。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving models trained solely with imitation learning
(IL) often suffer from poor generalization. In contrast, reinforcement learning
(RL) promotes exploration through reward maximization but faces challenges such
as sample inefficiency and unstable convergence. A natural solution is to
combine IL and RL. Moving beyond the conventional two-stage paradigm (IL
pretraining followed by RL fine-tuning), we propose CoIRL-AD, a competitive
dual-policy framework that enables IL and RL agents to interact during
training. CoIRL-AD introduces a competition-based mechanism that facilitates
knowledge exchange while preventing gradient conflicts. Experiments on the
nuScenes dataset show an 18% reduction in collision rate compared to baselines,
along with stronger generalization and improved performance on long-tail
scenarios. Code is available at: https://github.com/SEU-zxj/CoIRL-AD.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have made them highly
effective at reasoning tasks. However, the principles underlying the
construction of performant VL reasoning training datasets remain poorly
understood. In this work, we introduce several data curation approaches and
study their impacts on VL reasoning capabilities by carefully controlling
training and evaluation setups. We analyze the effects of context (image and
question pair) sources, implement targeted data interventions, and explore
scaling up images, questions, and chain-of-thought (CoT) solutions. Our
findings reveal that (a) context source strategies significantly affect VLM
performance, (b) interventions such as auxiliary signals from image captions
and the inclusion of text-only reasoning yield substantial gains, and (c)
scaling all data dimensions (e.g., unique questions per image and unique CoTs
per image-question pair) consistently improves reasoning capability. Motivated
by these insights, we introduce HoneyBee, a large-scale, high-quality CoT
reasoning dataset with 2.5M examples consisting 350K image-question pairs. VLMs
trained with HoneyBee outperform state-of-the-art models across model sizes.
For instance, a HoneyBee-trained VLM with 3B parameters outperforms the SOTA
model and the base model by 7.8% and 24.8%, respectively, on MathVerse.
Furthermore, we propose a test-time scaling strategy that reduces decoding cost
by 73% without sacrificing accuracy. Overall, this work presents improved
strategies for VL reasoning dataset curation research.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理带噪声标签的开放集域泛化时，难以有效弥合域间差距，特别是在有标签的干净数据有限的情况下。

Method: 采用两阶段证据损失聚类方法提升标签可靠性感知，并提出残差流匹配机制建模结构化的域和类别条件残差，实现多样化和不确定性感知的迁移路径。

Conclusion: EReLiFM通过证据可靠性感知和残差流元学习，有效解决了带噪声标签的开放集域泛化问题，提升了模型在真实场景中的适用性。

Abstract: Open-Set Domain Generalization (OSDG) aims to enable deep learning models to
recognize unseen categories in new domains, which is crucial for real-world
applications. Label noise hinders open-set domain generalization by corrupting
source-domain knowledge, making it harder to recognize known classes and reject
unseen ones. While existing methods address OSDG under Noisy Labels (OSDG-NL)
using hyperbolic prototype-guided meta-learning, they struggle to bridge domain
gaps, especially with limited clean labeled data. In this paper, we propose
Evidential Reliability-Aware Residual Flow Meta-Learning (EReLiFM). We first
introduce an unsupervised two-stage evidential loss clustering method to
promote label reliability awareness. Then, we propose a residual flow matching
mechanism that models structured domain- and category-conditioned residuals,
enabling diverse and uncertainty-aware transfer paths beyond
interpolation-based augmentation. During this meta-learning process, the model
is optimized such that the update direction on the clean set maximizes the loss
decrease on the noisy set, using pseudo labels derived from the most confident
predicted class for supervision. Experimental results show that EReLiFM
outperforms existing methods on OSDG-NL, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. The source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型推理效率是关键挑战，多token并行预测可显著减少推理时间，但会导致token不兼容和结构不一致问题，且传统方法无法回溯修正错误预测。

Method: 提出自校正图像生成方法，通过新颖的训练方案在上下文中注入随机token，提高鲁棒性并在采样过程中实现token修正。

Result: 在ImageNet-256、CIFAR-10图像生成和UCF-101、NuScenes视频生成上评估，显示在两种模态上都有显著改进。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持并行token预测效率优势的同时，显著提高了生成质量，解决了多token预测中的结构不一致问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in image and video generation have raised significant
interest from both academia and industry. A key challenge in this field is
improving inference efficiency, as model size and the number of inference steps
directly impact the commercial viability of generative models while also posing
fundamental scientific challenges. A promising direction involves combining
auto-regressive sequential token modeling with multi-token prediction per step,
reducing inference time by up to an order of magnitude. However, predicting
multiple tokens in parallel can introduce structural inconsistencies due to
token incompatibilities, as capturing complex joint dependencies during
training remains challenging. Traditionally, once tokens are sampled, there is
no mechanism to backtrack and refine erroneous predictions. We propose a method
for self-correcting image generation by iteratively refining sampled tokens. We
achieve this with a novel training scheme that injects random tokens in the
context, improving robustness and enabling token fixing during sampling. Our
method preserves the efficiency benefits of parallel token prediction while
significantly enhancing generation quality. We evaluate our approach on image
generation using the ImageNet-256 and CIFAR-10 datasets, as well as on video
generation with UCF-101 and NuScenes, demonstrating substantial improvements
across both modalities.

Motivation: 解决红外小目标检测中面临的跨域偏移和异方差噪声扰动的双重挑战，传统方法在真实场景中由于分布偏差而性能受限。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1) 小波引导的跨域合成生成目标域对齐的训练样本；2) 真实噪声不变性学习，从目标域提取真实噪声特征构建动态噪声库，通过自监督损失学习噪声不变性。

Conclusion: Ivan-ISTD框架有效解决了红外小目标检测中的跨域和噪声问题，创建了Dynamic-ISTD基准数据集，验证了方法的通用性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In the multimedia domain, Infrared Small Target Detection (ISTD) plays a
important role in drone-based multi-modality sensing. To address the dual
challenges of cross-domain shift and heteroscedastic noise perturbations in
ISTD, we propose a doubly wavelet-guided Invariance learning
framework(Ivan-ISTD). In the first stage, we generate training samples aligned
with the target domain using Wavelet-guided Cross-domain Synthesis. This
wavelet-guided alignment machine accurately separates the target background
through multi-frequency wavelet filtering. In the second stage, we introduce
Real-domain Noise Invariance Learning, which extracts real noise
characteristics from the target domain to build a dynamic noise library. The
model learns noise invariance through self-supervised loss, thereby overcoming
the limitations of distribution bias in traditional artificial noise modeling.
Finally, we create the Dynamic-ISTD Benchmark, a cross-domain dynamic
degradation dataset that simulates the distribution shifts encountered in
real-world applications. Additionally, we validate the versatility of our
method using other real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of many
quantitative metrics. In particular, Ivan-ISTD demonstrates excellent
robustness in cross-domain scenarios. The code for this work can be found at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出使用时空一致的代理节点来表示视频中动态变化的对象/场景，克服传统像素级匹配和跟踪的不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频表示方法过度依赖不稳定且过于细粒度的运动和外观建模先验（如像素级匹配和跟踪），跟踪误差、遮挡和大运动会破坏视觉对象表示。

Method: 使用分层代理节点稳定表达视觉对象的多尺度结构，通过动态表示更新机制利用视频时空先验，并采用形状和纹理表示的分离编码方式。

Result: 实验表明该方法以更少参数实现高视频重建精度，并支持复杂的视频处理任务，包括视频修复和基于关键帧的时间一致性视频编辑。

Conclusion: 代理节点表示方法能够有效处理跟踪误差、长期运动、遮挡和视角变化，同时提供可控的细粒度外观编辑能力。

Abstract: Current video representations heavily rely on unstable and over-grained
priors for motion and appearance modelling, \emph{i.e.}, pixel-level matching
and tracking. A tracking error of just a few pixels would lead to the collapse
of the visual object representation, not to mention occlusions and large motion
frequently occurring in videos. To overcome the above mentioned vulnerability,
this work proposes spatio-temporally consistent proxy nodes to represent
dynamically changing objects/scenes in the video. On the one hand, the
hierarchical proxy nodes have the ability to stably express the multi-scale
structure of visual objects, so they are not affected by accumulated tracking
error, long-term motion, occlusion, and viewpoint variation. On the other hand,
the dynamic representation update mechanism of the proxy nodes adequately
leverages spatio-temporal priors of the video to mitigate the impact of
inaccurate trackers, thereby effectively handling drastic changes in scenes and
objects. Additionally, the decoupled encoding manner of the shape and texture
representations across different visual objects in the video facilitates
controllable and fine-grained appearance editing capability. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed representation achieves high video
reconstruction accuracy with fewer parameters and supports complex video
processing tasks, including video in-painting and keyframe-based temporally
consistent video editing.

TL;DR: 提出了两种新的损失函数——乘法损失和置信度自适应乘法损失，用于医学和细胞图像的语义分割，通过乘法组合交叉熵和Dice损失来提升在数据稀缺情况下的分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像由于隐私、伦理和标注成本高等问题面临数据稀缺挑战，而广泛使用的交叉熵和Dice损失的加法组合对超参数敏感且在有限数据下表现不佳，需要更鲁棒高效的训练目标。

Method: 乘法损失将交叉熵和Dice损失进行乘法组合，基于预测置信度动态调节梯度；置信度自适应乘法损失在此基础上引入置信度驱动的指数缩放机制，整合预测概率和Dice系数来强调困难样本。

Result: 在细胞和医学分割基准测试中，该框架始终优于调优的加法损失函数和现有损失函数，在极端数据稀缺情况下表现出色。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一个简单、有效且无需超参数调整的机制，能够在具有挑战性的数据限制下实现鲁棒的分割性能。

Abstract: We propose two novel loss functions, Multiplicative Loss and
Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss, for semantic segmentation in medical
and cellular images. Although Cross Entropy and Dice Loss are widely used,
their additive combination is sensitive to hyperparameters and often performs
suboptimally, especially with limited data. Medical images suffer from data
scarcity due to privacy, ethics, and costly annotations, requiring robust and
efficient training objectives. Our Multiplicative Loss combines Cross Entropy
and Dice losses multiplicatively, dynamically modulating gradients based on
prediction confidence. This reduces penalties for confident correct predictions
and amplifies gradients for incorrect overconfident ones, stabilizing
optimization. Building on this, Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss applies
a confidence-driven exponential scaling inspired by Focal Loss, integrating
predicted probabilities and Dice coefficients to emphasize difficult samples.
This enhances learning under extreme data scarcity by strengthening gradients
when confidence is low. Experiments on cellular and medical segmentation
benchmarks show our framework consistently outperforms tuned additive and
existing loss functions, offering a simple, effective, and hyperparameter-free
mechanism for robust segmentation under challenging data limitations.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效缓解OOD检测中的过度自信问题，且无需额外OOD数据集，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial when deploying deep neural
networks in the real world to ensure the reliability and safety of their
applications. One main challenge in OOD detection is that neural network models
often produce overconfident predictions on OOD data. While some methods using
auxiliary OOD datasets or generating fake OOD images have shown promising OOD
detection performance, they are limited by the high costs of data collection
and training. In this study, we propose a novel and effective OOD detection
method that utilizes local background features as fake OOD features for model
training. Inspired by the observation that OOD images generally share similar
background regions with ID images, the background features are extracted from
ID images as simulated OOD visual representations during training based on the
local invariance of convolution. Through being optimized to reduce the
$L_2$-norm of these background features, the neural networks are able to
alleviate the overconfidence issue on OOD data. Extensive experiments on
multiple standard OOD detection benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our
method and its wide combinatorial compatibility with existing post-hoc methods,
with new state-of-the-art performance achieved from our method.

Conclusion: AngularFuse通过同时约束梯度幅度和方向，确保了融合图像既保持纹理强度又保留正确的边缘方向，具有优越的融合能力。

Abstract: Visible-infrared image fusion is crucial in key applications such as
autonomous driving and nighttime surveillance. Its main goal is to integrate
multimodal information to produce enhanced images that are better suited for
downstream tasks. Although deep learning based fusion methods have made
significant progress, mainstream unsupervised approaches still face serious
challenges in practical applications. Existing methods mostly rely on manually
designed loss functions to guide the fusion process. However, these loss
functions have obvious limitations. On one hand, the reference images
constructed by existing methods often lack details and have uneven brightness.
On the other hand, the widely used gradient losses focus only on gradient
magnitude. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an angle-based
perception framework for spatial-sensitive image fusion (AngularFuse). At
first, we design a cross-modal complementary mask module to force the network
to learn complementary information between modalities. Then, a fine-grained
reference image synthesis strategy is introduced. By combining Laplacian edge
enhancement with adaptive histogram equalization, reference images with richer
details and more balanced brightness are generated. Last but not least, we
introduce an angle-aware loss, which for the first time constrains both
gradient magnitude and direction simultaneously in the gradient domain.
AngularFuse ensures that the fused images preserve both texture intensity and
correct edge orientation. Comprehensive experiments on the MSRS, RoadScene, and
M3FD public datasets show that AngularFuse outperforms existing mainstream
methods with clear margin. Visual comparisons further confirm that our method
produces sharper and more detailed results in challenging scenes, demonstrating
superior fusion capability.

Conclusion: SpineBench揭示了当前MLLMs在脊柱医学应用中的不足，为未来改进提供了指导，该基准已公开可用。

Abstract: With the increasing integration of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
into the medical field, comprehensive evaluation of their performance in
various medical domains becomes critical. However, existing benchmarks
primarily assess general medical tasks, inadequately capturing performance in
nuanced areas like the spine, which relies heavily on visual input. To address
this, we introduce SpineBench, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA)
benchmark designed for fine-grained analysis and evaluation of MLLMs in the
spinal domain. SpineBench comprises 64,878 QA pairs from 40,263 spine images,
covering 11 spinal diseases through two critical clinical tasks: spinal disease
diagnosis and spinal lesion localization, both in multiple-choice format.
SpineBench is built by integrating and standardizing image-label pairs from
open-source spinal disease datasets, and samples challenging hard negative
options for each VQA pair based on visual similarity (similar but not the same

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAGS是一个基于语义优先级的3D动态城市场景重建框架，通过语义引导的剪枝和优先级驱动渲染，在保持关键对象细节的同时显著提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态3D城市场景重建方法在保真度和计算成本之间存在明显权衡，因为它们采用语义无关的设计，对静态背景和安全关键对象分配相同的资源。

Method: 引入语义引导剪枝和正则化策略，使用混合重要性度量简化非关键场景元素；采用优先级驱动渲染管道，通过基于优先级的深度预传递来剔除被遮挡基元。

Result: 在Waymo和KITTI数据集上的实验表明，PAGS实现了卓越的重建质量（特别是安全关键对象），同时显著减少训练时间并将渲染速度提升至超过350 FPS。

Conclusion: PAGS通过将任务感知语义优先级直接注入3D重建和渲染管道，有效解决了动态3D城市场景重建中保真度与效率的权衡问题。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D urban scenes is crucial for autonomous driving, yet
current methods face a stark trade-off between fidelity and computational cost.
This inefficiency stems from their semantically agnostic design, which
allocates resources uniformly, treating static backgrounds and safety-critical
objects with equal importance. To address this, we introduce Priority-Adaptive
Gaussian Splatting (PAGS), a framework that injects task-aware semantic
priorities directly into the 3D reconstruction and rendering pipeline. PAGS
introduces two core contributions: (1) Semantically-Guided Pruning and
Regularization strategy, which employs a hybrid importance metric to
aggressively simplify non-critical scene elements while preserving fine-grained
details on objects vital for navigation. (2) Priority-Driven Rendering
pipeline, which employs a priority-based depth pre-pass to aggressively cull
occluded primitives and accelerate the final shading computations. Extensive
experiments on the Waymo and KITTI datasets demonstrate that PAGS achieves
exceptional reconstruction quality, particularly on safety-critical objects,
while significantly reducing training time and boosting rendering speeds to
over 350 FPS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于部分相关视频检索(PRVR)的双重学习框架DL-DKD++，通过动态知识蒸馏从大规模视觉语言预训练模型向轻量级任务特定网络传递知识，在多个数据集上取得了最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本-视频检索方法假设视频经过预修剪且仅包含文本相关内容，但实际中视频通常是未经修剪的长视频，包含复杂的背景内容，因此需要处理部分相关性的更实用挑战性任务。

Method: 提出双重学习框架DL-DKD++，包含大型教师模型和紧凑的双分支学生网络。学生网络包括继承分支（吸收教师可转移知识）和探索分支（学习PRVR数据集特定信息）。采用动态软目标构建机制，用自适应软目标替代硬目标监督。

Result: 在TVR、ActivityNet和Charades-STA数据集上的实验结果表明，所提模型在PRVR任务上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DL-DKD++框架通过动态知识蒸馏有效解决了部分相关视频检索问题，在多个基准数据集上表现出色，为实际应用中的长视频检索提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Almost all previous text-to-video retrieval works ideally assume that videos
are pre-trimmed with short durations containing solely text-related content.
However, in practice, videos are typically untrimmed in long durations with
much more complicated background content. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on
the more practical yet challenging task of Partially Relevant Video Retrieval
(PRVR), which aims to retrieve partially relevant untrimmed videos with the
given query. To tackle this task, we propose a novel framework that distills
generalization knowledge from a powerful large-scale vision-language
pre-trained model and transfers it to a lightweight, task-specific PRVR
network. Specifically, we introduce a Dual Learning framework with Dynamic
Knowledge Distillation (DL-DKD++), where a large teacher model provides
supervision to a compact dual-branch student network. The student model
comprises two branches: an inheritance branch that absorbs transferable
knowledge from the teacher, and an exploration branch that learns task-specific
information from the PRVR dataset to address domain gaps. To further enhance
learning, we incorporate a dynamic soft-target construction mechanism. By
replacing rigid hard-target supervision with adaptive soft targets that evolve
during training, our method enables the model to better capture the
fine-grained, partial relevance between videos and queries. Experiment results
demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on
TVR, ActivityNet, and Charades-STA datasets for PRVR. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了视觉语言模型(VLMs)中的logo幻觉问题，发现模型会错误生成品牌名称或文本内容，即使logo中不包含可见文字。通过系统测试和分析，揭示了模型依赖符号先验而非真实字形感知的问题，并提出了缓解方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在多模态推理方面取得了显著进展，但仍然容易产生幻觉，即输出缺乏视觉证据支持。本文特别关注一个被忽视的设置：logo幻觉，即模型在logo不包含可见文字的情况下仍生成品牌名称或文本内容。

Method: 使用纯符号、混合和含文本logo的精选数据集，以及具有挑战性的Hard-60子集，系统测量领先VLM的幻觉程度。通过九种结构化扰动测试鲁棒性，并对开源LLaVA进行嵌入级分析，识别导致幻觉的投影器维度。

Result: 研究发现幻觉在强扭曲下仍然存在，遮挡暴露了最严重的弱点。嵌入分析表明幻觉与投影器维度的小子集相关，针对性消融显著减少错误同时保持OCR准确性。模型对标志性圆形logo特别依赖符号先验。

Conclusion: VLM通常依赖符号先验而非真正的字形感知，投影器子空间在这种失败模式中起决定性作用。本文贡献了新的诊断视角和可行的缓解见解，强调投影器解耦和OCR引导解码是构建更可信多模态系统的有前景方向。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in multimodal
reasoning; yet, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, where outputs are not
grounded in visual evidence. In this paper, we investigate a previously
overlooked setting: logo hallucination, where models generate brand names or
textual content despite logos containing no visible words. Using curated splits
of pure symbols, hybrids, and text-bearing logos, as well as the challenging
Hard-60 subset, we systematically measure hallucination across leading VLMs. We
further probe robustness through nine structured perturbations and show that
hallucinations persist even under strong distortions, with occlusion exposing
the sharpest weaknesses. Embedding-level analysis with open-weight LLaVA
demonstrates that hallucination is tied to a small subset of projector
dimensions, and targeted ablation substantially reduces errors while preserving
OCR accuracy. Together, these findings reveal that VLMs often rely on symbolic
priors rather than genuine glyph perception, particularly for iconic circular
logos, and that projector subspaces play a decisive role in this failure mode.
Our work contributes both a novel diagnostic lens and actionable mitigation
insights, highlighting projector disentanglement and OCR-guided decoding as
promising directions for building more trustworthy multimodal systems.

Motivation: 解决街景场景中的新视角合成问题，要求从训练轨迹的车载帧生成不同轨迹（如不同车道或行驶方向）的视图渲染。

Method: 两阶段方法：首先使用3D高斯泼溅重建场景并渲染目标相机视角，然后通过单步扩散模型增强图像质量。

Result: 在公开测试排行榜上获得0.432的综合分数，总体排名第二。

Conclusion: 提出的混合方法在街景新视角合成任务中表现优异，验证了高斯泼溅与扩散模型结合的有效性。

Abstract: This paper describes the Qualcomm AI Research solution to the RealADSim-NVS
challenge, hosted at the RealADSim Workshop at ICCV 2025. The challenge
concerns novel view synthesis in street scenes, and participants are required
to generate, starting from car-centric frames captured during some training
traversals, renders of the same urban environment as viewed from a different
traversal (e.g. different street lane or car direction). Our solution is
inspired by hybrid methods in scene generation and generative simulators
merging gaussian splatting and diffusion models, and it is composed of two
stages: First, we fit a 3D reconstruction of the scene and render novel views
as seen from the target cameras. Then, we enhance the resulting frames with a
dedicated single-step diffusion model. We discuss specific choices made in the
initialization of gaussian primitives as well as the finetuning of the enhancer
model and its training data curation. We report the performance of our model
design and we ablate its components in terms of novel view quality as measured
by PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS. On the public leaderboard reporting test results, our
proposal reaches an aggregated score of 0.432, achieving the second place
overall.

TL;DR: CurriFlow是一个用于语义场景补全的新框架，通过光流时序对齐和课程学习深度融合，在仅使用相机输入的情况下实现了最先进的3D语义场景补全性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SSC方法依赖时序堆叠或深度投影，缺乏显式的运动推理，难以处理遮挡和噪声深度监督问题。

Method: 使用光流进行多级特征对齐，结合课程学习从稀疏LiDAR深度渐进过渡到密集立体深度，并利用SAM提供语义先验监督。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI基准测试中达到16.9的平均IoU，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: CurriFlow通过运动引导和课程感知设计，有效提升了基于相机的3D语义场景补全能力。

Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) aims to infer complete 3D geometry and
semantics from monocular images, serving as a crucial capability for
camera-based perception in autonomous driving. However, existing SSC methods
relying on temporal stacking or depth projection often lack explicit motion
reasoning and struggle with occlusions and noisy depth supervision. We propose
CurriFlow, a novel semantic occupancy prediction framework that integrates
optical flow-based temporal alignment with curriculum-guided depth fusion.
CurriFlow employs a multi-level fusion strategy to align segmentation, visual,
and depth features across frames using pre-trained optical flow, thereby
improving temporal consistency and dynamic object understanding. To enhance
geometric robustness, a curriculum learning mechanism progressively transitions
from sparse yet accurate LiDAR depth to dense but noisy stereo depth during
training, ensuring stable optimization and seamless adaptation to real-world
deployment. Furthermore, semantic priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
provide category-agnostic supervision, strengthening voxel-level semantic
learning and spatial consistency. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI benchmark
demonstrate that CurriFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance with a mean
IoU of 16.9, validating the effectiveness of our motion-guided and
curriculum-aware design for camera-based 3D semantic scene completion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种可学习的自适应子采样框架，通过注意力引导的动态采样机制，在降低深度学习模型复杂度的同时提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络性能提升往往伴随计算复杂度和成本的增加，特别是在3D体积或视频分类任务中，由于固有的冗余性，并非所有切片或帧都是必要的。现有方法虽然解决了不可微性问题，但缺乏输入自适应性。

Method: 开发了注意力引导的采样模块，该模块即使在推理阶段也能根据输入动态调整采样策略，解决了传统方法仅任务自适应而非输入自适应的问题。

Result: 在MedMNIST3D医学影像数据集和两个超声视频数据集（包括真实临床条件下收集的具有挑战性的内部数据集）上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的动态自适应采样方法能够显著降低深度神经网络模型的复杂度，同时带来性能提升，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: Although deep neural networks have provided impressive gains in performance,
these improvements often come at the cost of increased computational complexity
and expense. In many cases, such as 3D volume or video classification tasks,
not all slices or frames are necessary due to inherent redundancies. To address
this issue, we propose a novel learnable subsampling framework that can be
integrated into any neural network architecture. Subsampling, being a
nondifferentiable operation, poses significant challenges for direct adaptation
into deep learning models. While some works, have proposed solutions using the
Gumbel-max trick to overcome the problem of non-differentiability, they fall
short in a crucial aspect: they are only task-adaptive and not inputadaptive.
Once the sampling mechanism is learned, it remains static and does not adjust
to different inputs, making it unsuitable for real-world applications. To this
end, we propose an attention-guided sampling module that adapts to inputs even
during inference. This dynamic adaptation results in performance gains and
reduces complexity in deep neural network models. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on 3D medical imaging datasets from MedMNIST3D as
well as two ultrasound video datasets for classification tasks, one of them
being a challenging in-house dataset collected under real-world clinical
conditions.

TL;DR: 提出了STORM-PSR双流框架，通过结合空间和时间特征来改进程序步骤识别，特别针对部分遮挡情况下的鲁棒性提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有最先进模型仅依赖检测单个视频帧中的装配对象状态，忽略了时间特征，导致在对象部分遮挡时模型鲁棒性和准确性受限。

Method: 采用双流框架：装配状态检测流处理无遮挡对象视图，时空流通过空间编码器和基于Transformer的时间编码器捕获空间和时间特征，即使在部分遮挡下也能识别步骤完成。

Result: 在MECCANO和IndustReal数据集上评估，相比先前方法，将装配步骤完成的实际与预测延迟平均减少了11.2%和26.1%。

Conclusion: 时空流不依赖无遮挡对象视图即可推断完成步骤，这种延迟减少主要由时空流驱动，证明了该方法在部分遮挡情况下的有效性。

Abstract: Procedure step recognition (PSR) aims to identify all correctly completed
steps and their sequential order in videos of procedural tasks. The existing
state-of-the-art models rely solely on detecting assembly object states in
individual video frames. By neglecting temporal features, model robustness and
accuracy are limited, especially when objects are partially occluded. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Occlusion-Resilient
Modeling for Procedure Step Recognition (STORM-PSR), a dual-stream framework
for PSR that leverages both spatial and temporal features. The assembly state
detection stream operates effectively with unobstructed views of the object,
while the spatio-temporal stream captures both spatial and temporal features to
recognize step completions even under partial occlusion. This stream includes a
spatial encoder, pre-trained using a novel weakly supervised approach to
capture meaningful spatial representations, and a transformer-based temporal
encoder that learns how these spatial features relate over time. STORM-PSR is
evaluated on the MECCANO and IndustReal datasets, reducing the average delay
between actual and predicted assembly step completions by 11.2% and 26.1%,
respectively, compared to prior methods. We demonstrate that this reduction in
delay is driven by the spatio-temporal stream, which does not rely on
unobstructed views of the object to infer completed steps. The code for
STORM-PSR, along with the newly annotated MECCANO labels, is made publicly
available at https://timschoonbeek.github.io/stormpsr .

Motivation: 解决场景坐标回归模型在训练图像缺乏多视角约束时出现的退化问题，通过引入先验知识来提升模型性能。

Method: 将SCR模型训练重新解释为概率框架，融入多种先验：简单深度分布先验和基于大规模室内扫描数据训练的3D点云扩散模型先验，在训练过程中将预测的3D场景点推向合理几何结构。

Result: 在三个室内数据集上，先验方法帮助学习更好的场景表示，产生更一致的场景点云、更高的配准率和更好的相机位姿，对下游任务如新视角合成和相机重定位有积极影响。

Conclusion: 概率化重新解释和先验知识的融入能有效提升场景坐标回归模型的性能，特别是在训练数据约束不足的情况下。

Abstract: Scene coordinate regression (SCR) models have proven to be powerful implicit
scene representations for 3D vision, enabling visual relocalization and
structure-from-motion. SCR models are trained specifically for one scene. If
training images imply insufficient multi-view constraints SCR models
degenerate. We present a probabilistic reinterpretation of training SCR models,
which allows us to infuse high-level reconstruction priors. We investigate
multiple such priors, ranging from simple priors over the distribution of
reconstructed depth values to learned priors over plausible scene coordinate
configurations. For the latter, we train a 3D point cloud diffusion model on a
large corpus of indoor scans. Our priors push predicted 3D scene points towards
plausible geometry at each training step to increase their likelihood. On three
indoor datasets our priors help learning better scene representations,
resulting in more coherent scene point clouds, higher registration rates and
better camera poses, with a positive effect on down-stream tasks such as novel
view synthesis and camera relocalization.

Conclusion: VLMs为城市监控提供了有前景的技术路径，能够整合视觉理解和自然语言推理，有望解决传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Urban monitoring of public infrastructure (such as waste bins, road signs,
vegetation, sidewalks, and construction sites) poses significant challenges due
to the diversity of objects, environments, and contextual conditions involved.
Current state-of-the-art approaches typically rely on a combination of IoT
sensors and manual inspections, which are costly, difficult to scale, and often
misaligned with citizens' perception formed through direct visual observation.
This raises a critical question: Can machines now "see" like citizens and infer
informed opinions about the condition of urban infrastructure? Vision-Language
Models (VLMs), which integrate visual understanding with natural language
reasoning, have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in processing
complex visual information, turning them into a promising technology to address
this challenge. This systematic review investigates the role of VLMs in urban
monitoring, with particular emphasis on zero-shot applications. Following the
PRISMA methodology, we analyzed 32 peer-reviewed studies published between 2021
and 2025 to address four core research questions: (1) What urban monitoring
tasks have been effectively addressed using VLMs? (2) Which VLM architectures
and frameworks are most commonly used and demonstrate superior performance? (3)
What datasets and resources support this emerging field? (4) How are VLM-based
applications evaluated, and what performance levels have been reported?

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低场磁共振成像虽然成本低且便携，但信噪比低、诊断质量差，需要一种能在不依赖昂贵基础设施的情况下提升图像质量的方法。

Method: 使用条件流匹配框架，通过直接回归最优速度场来学习噪声分布与目标数据分布之间的连续流，避免了传统生成模型的迭代采样或对抗目标。

Result: CFM不仅实现了最先进的性能，而且对分布内和分布外数据都具有鲁棒性，同时使用的参数数量显著少于竞争性深度学习方法。

Conclusion: CFM作为一种强大且可扩展的MRI重建工具，在资源有限的临床环境中具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for image quality transfer based on
conditional flow matching (CFM). Unlike conventional generative models that
rely on iterative sampling or adversarial objectives, CFM learns a continuous
flow between a noise distribution and target data distributions through the
direct regression of an optimal velocity field. We evaluate this approach in
the context of low-field magnetic resonance imaging (LF-MRI), a rapidly
emerging modality that offers affordable and portable scanning but suffers from
inherently low signal-to-noise ratio and reduced diagnostic quality. Our
framework is designed to reconstruct high-field-like MR images from their
corresponding low-field inputs, thereby bridging the quality gap without
requiring expensive infrastructure. Experiments demonstrate that CFM not only
achieves state-of-the-art performance, but also generalizes robustly to both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution data. Importantly, it does so while
utilizing significantly fewer parameters than competing deep learning methods.
These results underline the potential of CFM as a powerful and scalable tool
for MRI reconstruction, particularly in resource-limited clinical environments.

Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的代理系统在长视频理解中存在两个主要问题：1) 在单帧层面建模推理，难以捕捉连续帧的时序上下文；2) 稀疏帧采样可能丢失关键信息。

Method: 受人类从粗到细回忆过程启发，VideoLucy采用分层记忆结构，在不同层级定义记忆的细节程度和时序范围，通过基于代理的迭代回溯机制系统挖掘视频范围内与问题相关的深度记忆。

Conclusion: VideoLucy通过分层记忆和深度回溯机制有效解决了长视频理解中的时序上下文和关键信息保留问题，为长视频理解提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that agent-based systems leveraging large language
models (LLMs) for key information retrieval and integration have emerged as a
promising approach for long video understanding. However, these systems face
two major challenges. First, they typically perform modeling and reasoning on
individual frames, struggling to capture the temporal context of consecutive
frames. Second, to reduce the cost of dense frame-level captioning, they adopt
sparse frame sampling, which risks discarding crucial information. To overcome
these limitations, we propose VideoLucy, a deep memory backtracking framework
for long video understanding. Inspired by the human recollection process from
coarse to fine, VideoLucy employs a hierarchical memory structure with
progressive granularity. This structure explicitly defines the detail level and
temporal scope of memory at different hierarchical depths. Through an
agent-based iterative backtracking mechanism, VideoLucy systematically mines
video-wide, question-relevant deep memories until sufficient information is
gathered to provide a confident answer. This design enables effective temporal
understanding of consecutive frames while preserving critical details. In
addition, we introduce EgoMem, a new benchmark for long video understanding.
EgoMem is designed to comprehensively evaluate a model's ability to understand
complex events that unfold over time and capture fine-grained details in
extremely long videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
VideoLucy. Built on open-source models, VideoLucy significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on multiple long video understanding benchmarks,
achieving performance even surpassing the latest proprietary models such as
GPT-4o. Our code and dataset will be made publicly at

Conclusion: 指出了当前研究的五大局限性，并为这一新兴领域的未来发展提出了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Chest Xray imaging is a widely used diagnostic tool in modern medicine, and
its high utilization creates substantial workloads for radiologists. To
alleviate this burden, vision language models are increasingly applied to
automate Chest Xray radiology report generation (CXRRRG), aiming for clinically
accurate descriptions while reducing manual effort. Conventional approaches,
however, typically rely on single images, failing to capture the longitudinal
context necessary for producing clinically faithful comparison statements.
Recently, growing attention has been directed toward incorporating longitudinal
data into CXR RRG, enabling models to leverage historical studies in ways that
mirror radiologists diagnostic workflows. Nevertheless, existing surveys
primarily address single image CXRRRG and offer limited guidance for
longitudinal settings, leaving researchers without a systematic framework for
model design. To address this gap, this survey provides the first comprehensive
review of longitudinal radiology report generation (LRRG). Specifically, we
examine dataset construction strategies, report generation architectures
alongside longitudinally tailored designs, and evaluation protocols
encompassing both longitudinal specific measures and widely used benchmarks. We
further summarize LRRG methods performance, alongside analyses of different
ablation studies, which collectively highlight the critical role of
longitudinal information and architectural design choices in improving model
performance. Finally, we summarize five major limitations of current research
and outline promising directions for future development, aiming to lay a
foundation for advancing this emerging field.

Motivation: 针对深度伪造检测器在黑盒设置下的对抗攻击需求，旨在生成既具有高可转移性又视觉不可感知的对抗样本。

Method: 第一阶段：双流攻击模块（MNTD-PGD优化小扰动预算的梯度计算，SG-PGD聚焦视觉显著区域的扰动）；第二阶段：度量感知选择模块（基于对抗成功率和结构相似性评估候选样本）。

Result: 在未见过的检测器上，MS-GAGA比现有最先进攻击方法高出27%的错误分类率。

Conclusion: MS-GAGA通过两阶段框架有效平衡了对抗样本的可转移性和视觉不可感知性，在黑盒深度伪造检测攻击中表现出色。

Abstract: We present MS-GAGA (Metric-Selective Guided Adversarial Generation Attack), a
two-stage framework for crafting transferable and visually imperceptible
adversarial examples against deepfake detectors in black-box settings. In Stage
1, a dual-stream attack module generates adversarial candidates: MNTD-PGD
applies enhanced gradient calculations optimized for small perturbation
budgets, while SG-PGD focuses perturbations on visually salient regions. This
complementary design expands the adversarial search space and improves
transferability across unseen models. In Stage 2, a metric-aware selection
module evaluates candidates based on both their success against black-box
models and their structural similarity (SSIM) to the original image. By jointly
optimizing transferability and imperceptibility, MS-GAGA achieves up to 27%
higher misclassification rates on unseen detectors compared to state-of-the-art
attacks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种早期融合框架，在数据增强前结合文本和视觉特征，以保持空间一致性，解决多模态分割中传统增强方法破坏文本-图像对齐的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在医学影像中依赖数据增强，但传统的增强方法（如旋转、翻转）会破坏文本和图像之间的空间对齐，影响多模态分割性能。

Method: 采用早期融合框架，在数据增强前结合文本和视觉特征；设计轻量级生成器将文本嵌入投影到视觉空间，弥合语义差距。

Result: 在三个医学影像任务和四个分割框架上评估，取得了最先进的结果；生成伪图像的定位准确。

Conclusion: 提出的早期融合方法有效解决了多模态分割中的数据增强问题，代码已在GitHub公开。

Abstract: Deep learning relies heavily on data augmentation to mitigate limited data,
especially in medical imaging. Recent multimodal learning integrates text and
images for segmentation, known as referring or text-guided image segmentation.
However, common augmentations like rotation and flipping disrupt spatial
alignment between image and text, weakening performance. To address this, we
propose an early fusion framework that combines text and visual features before
augmentation, preserving spatial consistency. We also design a lightweight
generator that projects text embeddings into visual space, bridging semantic
gaps. Visualization of generated pseudo-images shows accurate region
localization. Our method is evaluated on three medical imaging tasks and four
segmentation frameworks, achieving state-of-the-art results. Code is publicly
available on GitHub: https://github.com/11yxk/MedSeg_EarlyFusion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种双阶段3D高斯泼溅框架，用于从运动模糊图像中准确重建3D场景，通过相机姿态优化和全局刚性变换解决运动模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS去模糊方法性能受限，存在对相机姿态精度的极端依赖以及无法有效控制运动模糊引起的错误高斯基元密集化问题。

Method: 采用双阶段框架：第一阶段相机姿态优化减少运动失真，第二阶段全局刚性变换校正模糊失真；引入子帧梯度聚合策略和多帧梯度冲突缓解机制。

Result: 综合实验验证了该去模糊方法的有效性，并在性能上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: BSGS框架能够有效解决运动模糊图像中的3D场景重建问题，通过双阶段优化策略显著提升了重建质量。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has exhibited remarkable capabilities in 3D scene
reconstruction.However, reconstructing high-quality 3D scenes from
motion-blurred images caused by camera motion poses a significant challenge.The
performance of existing 3DGS-based deblurring methods are limited due to their
inherent mechanisms, such as extreme dependence on the accuracy of camera poses
and inability to effectively control erroneous Gaussian primitives
densification caused by motion blur.To solve these problems, we introduce a
novel framework, Bi-Stage 3D Gaussian Splatting, to accurately reconstruct 3D
scenes from motion-blurred images.BSGS contains two stages. First, Camera Pose
Refinement roughly optimizes camera poses to reduce motion-induced distortions.
Second, with fixed rough camera poses, Global RigidTransformation further
corrects motion-induced blur distortions.To alleviate multi-subframe gradient
conflicts, we propose a subframe gradient aggregation strategy to optimize both
stages.Furthermore, a space-time bi-stage optimization strategy is introduced
to dynamically adjust primitive densification thresholds and prevent premature
noisy Gaussian generation in blurred regions. Comprehensive experiments verify
the effectiveness of our proposed deblurring method and show its superiority
over the state of the arts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出VAD方法，一种轻量级、无网络的UDF计算方法，通过Voronoi辅助扩散从无定向点云直接计算UDF，能够稳健处理各种拓扑结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经方法学习UDF存在数值不稳定、计算成本高和可控性有限的问题，需要更稳定高效的解决方案。

Method: 使用Voronoi几何准则为输入点分配双向法向量，通过能量函数优化对齐，然后扩散法向量形成近似UDF梯度场，最后积分得到UDF。

Result: VAD能够稳健处理水密和开放表面，以及复杂的非流形和非可定向几何体，同时保持计算效率和稳定性。

Conclusion: VAD提供了一种计算高效、数值稳定的UDF计算方法，适用于各种复杂拓扑结构，解决了现有神经方法的局限性。

Abstract: Unsigned Distance Fields (UDFs) provide a flexible representation for 3D
shapes with arbitrary topology, including open and closed surfaces, orientable
and non-orientable geometries, and non-manifold structures. While recent neural
approaches have shown promise in learning UDFs, they often suffer from
numerical instability, high computational cost, and limited controllability. We
present a lightweight, network-free method, Voronoi-Assisted Diffusion (VAD),
for computing UDFs directly from unoriented point clouds. Our approach begins
by assigning bi-directional normals to input points, guided by two
Voronoi-based geometric criteria encoded in an energy function for optimal
alignment. The aligned normals are then diffused to form an approximate UDF
gradient field, which is subsequently integrated to recover the final UDF.
Experiments demonstrate that VAD robustly handles watertight and open surfaces,
as well as complex non-manifold and non-orientable geometries, while remaining
computationally efficient and stable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖过度参数化的输入特征和辅助损失来提升效果，但这些策略对扩散模型来说并非必需。作者认为扩散模型应该能够仅通过标准L2分数匹配损失就匹配人体运动分布。

Method: 使用分数扩散模型，仅采用特征空间归一化和分析推导的权重来优化标准L2分数匹配损失，直接生成运动和形状，避免缓慢的关节形状恢复过程。

Result: 在无条件人体运动生成任务上达到了与最先进方法相当的结果，证明了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过理论驱动的组件设计和针对性消融实验，验证了每个新增组件的有效性，展示了扩散模型在人体运动生成中的潜力。

Abstract: Recent work has explored a range of model families for human motion
generation, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs), and diffusion-based models. Despite their differences, many
methods rely on over-parameterized input features and auxiliary losses to
improve empirical results. These strategies should not be strictly necessary
for diffusion models to match the human motion distribution. We show that on
par with state-of-the-art results in unconditional human motion generation are
achievable with a score-based diffusion model using only careful feature-space
normalization and analytically derived weightings for the standard L2
score-matching loss, while generating both motion and shape directly, thereby
avoiding slow post hoc shape recovery from joints. We build the method step by
step, with a clear theoretical motivation for each component, and provide
targeted ablations demonstrating the effectiveness of each proposed addition in
isolation.

### [59] [MMOT: The First Challenging Benchmark for Drone-based Multispectral Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12565)
*Tianhao Li,Tingfa Xu,Ying Wang,Haolin Qin,Xu Lin,Jianan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了首个无人机多光谱多目标跟踪基准MMOT，包含大规模数据集和新的多光谱定向感知跟踪方案，显著提升了小目标和密集场景的跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RGB跟踪算法在无人机视角下因空间外观线索退化而可靠性不足，多光谱图像能提供光谱反射率线索增强目标区分能力，但缺乏专用多光谱无人机数据集阻碍了该领域发展。

Method: 提出多光谱定向感知MOT方案：1)轻量级Spectral 3D-Stem集成光谱特征并保持RGB预训练兼容性；2)定向感知卡尔曼滤波器进行精确状态估计；3)端到端定向自适应transformer。

Result: 广泛实验表明多光谱输入显著优于RGB基线，特别是在小目标和密集物体跟踪方面表现突出。

Conclusion: MMOT基准和提出的方法将推动无人机多光谱多目标跟踪研究的发展，相关资源已公开。

Abstract: Drone-based multi-object tracking is essential yet highly challenging due to
small targets, severe occlusions, and cluttered backgrounds. Existing RGB-based
tracking algorithms heavily depend on spatial appearance cues such as color and
texture, which often degrade in aerial views, compromising reliability.
Multispectral imagery, capturing pixel-level spectral reflectance, provides
crucial cues that enhance object discriminability under degraded spatial
conditions. However, the lack of dedicated multispectral UAV datasets has
hindered progress in this domain. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMOT, the
first challenging benchmark for drone-based multispectral multi-object
tracking. It features three key characteristics: (i) Large Scale - 125 video
sequences with over 488.8K annotations across eight categories; (ii)
Comprehensive Challenges - covering diverse conditions such as extreme small
targets, high-density scenarios, severe occlusions, and complex motion; and
(iii) Precise Oriented Annotations - enabling accurate localization and reduced
ambiguity under aerial perspectives. To better extract spectral features and
leverage oriented annotations, we further present a multispectral and
orientation-aware MOT scheme adapting existing methods, featuring: (i) a
lightweight Spectral 3D-Stem integrating spectral features while preserving
compatibility with RGB pretraining; (ii) an orientation-aware Kalman filter for
precise state estimation; and (iii) an end-to-end orientation-adaptive
transformer. Extensive experiments across representative trackers consistently
show that multispectral input markedly improves tracking performance over RGB
baselines, particularly for small and densely packed objects. We believe our
work will advance drone-based multispectral multi-object tracking research. Our
MMOT, code, and benchmarks are publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Temporally Conditional Mamba模型，通过将条件信息整合到Mamba块的循环动态中，解决了现有方法在时间对齐方面的不足，显著提升了运动生成的时间对齐性、真实性和条件一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于时间相关输入信号学习人体运动是一个具有挑战性但影响广泛的任务。现有方法主要依赖交叉注意力机制融合条件与运动，但这种方法主要捕获全局交互，难以保持逐步时间对齐。

Method: 引入Temporally Conditional Mamba，一种基于Mamba的人体运动生成模型。该方法将条件信息整合到Mamba块的循环动态中，实现更好的时间对齐运动。

Result: 在各种人体运动任务上的广泛实验表明，该方法在时间对齐、运动真实性和条件一致性方面显著优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: 提出的TCM模型通过改进的时间对齐机制，有效解决了现有方法在人体运动生成中的时间对齐问题，取得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Learning human motion based on a time-dependent input signal presents a
challenging yet impactful task with various applications. The goal of this task
is to generate or estimate human movement that consistently reflects the
temporal patterns of conditioning inputs. Existing methods typically rely on
cross-attention mechanisms to fuse the condition with motion. However, this
approach primarily captures global interactions and struggles to maintain
step-by-step temporal alignment. To address this limitation, we introduce
Temporally Conditional Mamba, a new mamba-based model for human motion
generation. Our approach integrates conditional information into the recurrent
dynamics of the Mamba block, enabling better temporally aligned motion. To
validate the effectiveness of our method, we evaluate it on a variety of human
motion tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model significantly
improves temporal alignment, motion realism, and condition consistency over
state-of-the-art approaches. Our project page is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种零样本农业图像分割方法，结合Plantnet植物分类模型、DinoV2骨干网络和Segment Anything Model (SAM)，无需收集新数据集即可实现植物区域分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决农业图像分割中数据标注瓶颈问题，利用现有植物专用模型避免收集和标注新数据集的成本。

Method: 使用Plantnet的植物专用表示识别植物区域生成粗分割掩码，然后通过SAM进行精细分割。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上评估，使用Plantnet微调的DinoV2相比基础DinoV2模型在Jaccard指数(IoU)上获得一致性能提升。

Conclusion: 结合基础模型与植物专用模型可以有效缓解标注瓶颈，在多样化农业场景中实现有效分割。

Abstract: We present a zero-shot segmentation approach for agricultural imagery that
leverages Plantnet, a large-scale plant classification model, in conjunction
with its DinoV2 backbone and the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Rather than
collecting and annotating new datasets, our method exploits Plantnet's
specialized plant representations to identify plant regions and produce coarse
segmentation masks. These masks are then refined by SAM to yield detailed
segmentations. We evaluate on four publicly available datasets of various
complexity in terms of contrast including some where the limited size of the
training data and complex field conditions often hinder purely supervised
methods. Our results show consistent performance gains when using
Plantnet-fine-tuned DinoV2 over the base DinoV2 model, as measured by the
Jaccard Index (IoU). These findings highlight the potential of combining
foundation models with specialized plant-centric models to alleviate the
annotation bottleneck and enable effective segmentation in diverse agricultural
scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayerSync是一种领域无关的方法，通过使用扩散模型自身的中间表示作为内在指导来提升生成质量和训练效率，无需外部监督或预训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明扩散模型的生成质量与中间表示相关，外部指导能加速训练。作者希望利用模型内部不同层表示质量的差异，让语义丰富的表示指导较弱的表示，减少对外部监督的依赖。

Method: LayerSync是一种自给自足的即插即用正则化方法，通过正则化扩散模型的中间表示，让高质量表示指导低质量表示，无需额外开销即可提升训练效率。

Result: 在图像生成任务上显著提升生成质量和训练效率，例如在ImageNet数据集上加速基于流的transformer训练8.75倍，生成质量提升23.6%。方法还适用于音频、视频和运动生成等其他领域。

Conclusion: LayerSync提供了一种有效且通用的方法来提升扩散模型的训练效率和生成质量，无需外部监督或额外数据，具有很好的领域适应性。

Abstract: We propose LayerSync, a domain-agnostic approach for improving the generation
quality and the training efficiency of diffusion models. Prior studies have
highlighted the connection between the quality of generation and the
representations learned by diffusion models, showing that external guidance on
model intermediate representations accelerates training. We reconceptualize
this paradigm by regularizing diffusion models with their own intermediate
representations. Building on the observation that representation quality varies
across diffusion model layers, we show that the most semantically rich
representations can act as an intrinsic guidance for weaker ones, reducing the
need for external supervision. Our approach, LayerSync, is a self-sufficient,
plug-and-play regularizer term with no overhead on diffusion model training and
generalizes beyond the visual domain to other modalities. LayerSync requires no
pretrained models nor additional data. We extensively evaluate the method on
image generation and demonstrate its applicability to other domains such as
audio, video, and motion generation. We show that it consistently improves the
generation quality and the training efficiency. For example, we speed up the
training of flow-based transformer by over 8.75x on ImageNet dataset and
improved the generation quality by 23.6%. The code is available at
https://github.com/vita-epfl/LayerSync.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段训练框架，显著提升了像素空间扩散模型和一致性模型的性能，在ImageNet数据集上取得了SOTA结果，首次成功在无需预训练VAE或扩散模型的情况下直接训练高分辨率一致性模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决像素空间生成模型训练困难、性能不如潜在空间模型的问题，缩小两者之间的性能和效率差距。

Method: 两阶段训练框架：第一阶段预训练编码器捕获干净图像的语义信息并与确定性采样轨迹对齐；第二阶段将编码器与随机初始化解码器集成，端到端微调完整模型。

Result: 扩散模型在ImageNet-256上FID达到2.04，ImageNet-512上达到2.35（75 NFE），大幅超越先前像素空间方法；一致性模型在ImageNet-256上单步采样FID达到8.82，显著优于潜在空间对应模型。

Conclusion: 该训练框架成功缩小了像素空间与潜在空间生成模型的性能差距，为直接在高分辨率图像上训练一致性模型提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Pixel-space generative models are often more difficult to train and generally
underperform compared to their latent-space counterparts, leaving a persistent
performance and efficiency gap. In this paper, we introduce a novel two-stage
training framework that closes this gap for pixel-space diffusion and
consistency models. In the first stage, we pre-train encoders to capture
meaningful semantics from clean images while aligning them with points along
the same deterministic sampling trajectory, which evolves points from the prior
to the data distribution. In the second stage, we integrate the encoder with a
randomly initialized decoder and fine-tune the complete model end-to-end for
both diffusion and consistency models. Our training framework demonstrates
strong empirical performance on ImageNet dataset. Specifically, our diffusion
model reaches an FID of 2.04 on ImageNet-256 and 2.35 on ImageNet-512 with 75
number of function evaluations (NFE), surpassing prior pixel-space methods by a
large margin in both generation quality and efficiency while rivaling leading
VAE-based models at comparable training cost. Furthermore, on ImageNet-256, our
consistency model achieves an impressive FID of 8.82 in a single sampling step,
significantly surpassing its latent-space counterpart. To the best of our
knowledge, this marks the first successful training of a consistency model
directly on high-resolution images without relying on pre-trained VAEs or
diffusion models.

Motivation: 当前多模态推理方法依赖显式推理步骤，需要大量视觉-文本标注且推理延迟高，需要解决这些问题

Method: IVT-LR在潜在空间中注入视觉和文本信息，每个推理步骤包含潜在文本和潜在视觉两部分，采用渐进式多阶段训练策略

Result: 在M3CoT和ScienceQA上平均准确率提升5.45%，推理速度比现有方法快5倍以上

Conclusion: IVT-LR方法有效解决了多模态推理中的标注依赖和延迟问题，实现了高效准确的多模态推理

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning aims to enhance the capabilities of MLLMs by
incorporating intermediate reasoning steps before reaching the final answer. It
has evolved from text-only reasoning to the integration of visual information,
enabling the thought process to be conveyed through both images and text.
Despite its effectiveness, current multimodal reasoning methods depend on
explicit reasoning steps that require labor-intensive vision-text annotations
and inherently introduce significant inference latency. To address these
issues, we introduce multimodal latent reasoning with the advantages of
multimodal representation, reduced annotation, and inference efficiency. To
facilicate it, we propose Interleaved Vision-Text Latent Reasoning (IVT-LR),
which injects both visual and textual information in the reasoning process
within the latent space. Specifically, IVT-LR represents each reasoning step by
combining two implicit parts: latent text (the hidden states from the previous
step) and latent vision (a set of selected image embeddings). We further
introduce a progressive multi-stage training strategy to enable MLLMs to
perform the above multimodal latent reasoning steps. Experiments on M3CoT and
ScienceQA demonstrate that our IVT-LR method achieves an average performance
increase of 5.45% in accuracy, while simultaneously achieving a speed increase
of over 5 times compared to existing approaches. Code available at

Abstract: Underwater Salient Object Detection (USOD) faces significant challenges,
including underwater image quality degradation and domain gaps. Existing
methods tend to ignore the physical principles of underwater imaging or simply
treat degradation phenomena in underwater images as interference factors that
must be eliminated, failing to fully exploit the valuable information they
contain. We propose WaterFlow, a rectified flow-based framework for underwater
salient object detection that innovatively incorporates underwater physical
imaging information as explicit priors directly into the network training
process and introduces temporal dimension modeling, significantly enhancing the
model's capability for salient object identification. On the USOD10K dataset,
WaterFlow achieves a 0.072 gain in S_m, demonstrating the effectiveness and
superiority of our method. The code will be published after the acceptance.

Conclusion: ZSCFC方法能够高效有效地处理真实世界去噪问题，不依赖噪声分布假设，在单张噪声图像上即可完成训练和去噪。

Abstract: Zero-shot denoisers address the dataset dependency of deep-learning-based
denoisers, enabling the denoising of unseen single images. Nonetheless,
existing zero-shot methods suffer from long training times and rely on the
assumption of noise independence and a zero-mean property, limiting their
effectiveness in real-world denoising scenarios where noise characteristics are
more complicated. This paper proposes an efficient and effective method for
real-world denoising, the Zero-Shot denoiser based on Cross-Frequency
Consistency (ZSCFC), which enables training and denoising with a single noisy
image and does not rely on assumptions about noise distribution. Specifically,
image textures exhibit position similarity and content consistency across
different frequency bands, while noise does not. Based on this property, we
developed cross-frequency consistency loss and an ultralight network to realize
image denoising. Experiments on various real-world image datasets demonstrate
that our ZSCFC outperforms other state-of-the-art zero-shot methods in terms of
computational efficiency and denoising performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的人类网格恢复方法依赖大型非分层视觉变换器作为编码器，计算成本高。论文旨在开发更简单高效的模型，利用分层视觉基础模型的早期阶段来降低计算复杂度。

Method: 首先构建了三个轻量级HMR2.0变体作为基线，然后提出使用分层视觉基础模型（如Swin Transformer、GroupMixFormer、VMamba）的早期阶段作为编码器，仅使用前2-3个阶段进行训练和推理。

Conclusion: 分层视觉基础模型的早期阶段能够有效用于人类网格恢复和姿态估计任务，提供了一种计算效率更高的替代方案，同时保持与现有方法相当的准确性。

Abstract: In this work, we aim to develop simple and efficient models for human mesh
recovery (HMR) and its predecessor task, human pose estimation (HPE).
State-of-the-art HMR methods, such as HMR2.0 and its successors, rely on large,
non-hierarchical vision transformers as encoders, which are inherited from the
corresponding HPE models like ViTPose. To establish baselines across varying
computational budgets, we first construct three lightweight HMR2.0 variants by
adapting the corresponding ViTPose models. In addition, we propose leveraging
the early stages of hierarchical vision foundation models (VFMs), including
Swin Transformer, GroupMixFormer, and VMamba, as encoders. This design is
motivated by the observation that intermediate stages of hierarchical VFMs
produce feature maps with resolutions comparable to or higher than those of
non-hierarchical counterparts. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 27
hierarchical-VFM-based HMR and HPE models, demonstrating that using only the
first two or three stages achieves performance on par with full-stage models.
Moreover, we show that the resulting truncated models exhibit better trade-offs
between accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing lightweight
alternatives.

Motivation: 地球观测卫星产生大量多光谱图像时间序列数据，现有压缩方法存在存储传输挑战，学习型压缩缺乏公开预训练模型，且未能充分利用时序冗余。

Method: 开发了TerraCodec系列编解码器，包含适应多光谱输入的高效图像变体和利用时间依赖性的时序Transformer模型（TEC-TT），提出了潜在重打包技术训练灵活码率变换器模型。

Conclusion: 专门定制的学习型压缩算法是地球观测领域的有前景方向，代码和模型权重将以宽松许可证发布。

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) satellites produce massive streams of multispectral
image time series, posing pressing challenges for storage and transmission.
Yet, learned EO compression remains fragmented, lacking publicly available
pretrained models and misaligned with advances in compression for natural
imagery. Image codecs overlook temporal redundancy, while video codecs rely on
motion priors that fail to capture the radiometric evolution of largely static
scenes. We introduce TerraCodec (TEC), a family of learned codecs tailored to
EO. TEC includes efficient image-based variants adapted to multispectral
inputs, as well as a Temporal Transformer model (TEC-TT) that leverages
dependencies across time. To overcome the fixed-rate setting of today's neural
codecs, we present Latent Repacking, a novel method for training flexible-rate
transformer models that operate on varying rate-distortion settings. Trained on
Sentinel-2 data, TerraCodec outperforms classical codecs, achieving 3-10x
stronger compression at equivalent image quality. Beyond compression, TEC-TT
enables zero-shot cloud inpainting, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on the
AllClear benchmark. Our results establish bespoke, learned compression
algorithms as a promising direction for Earth observation. Code and model
weights will be released under a permissive license.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm systems necessitate efficient
collaborative perception mechanisms for diverse operational scenarios. Current
Bird's Eye View (BEV)-based approaches exhibit two main limitations:
bounding-box representations fail to capture complete semantic and geometric
information of the scene, and their performance significantly degrades when
encountering undefined or occluded objects. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel multi-UAV collaborative occupancy prediction framework. Our
framework effectively preserves 3D spatial structures and semantics through
integrating a Spatial-Aware Feature Encoder and Cross-Agent Feature
Integration. To enhance efficiency, we further introduce Altitude-Aware Feature
Reduction to compactly represent scene information, along with a Dual-Mask
Perceptual Guidance mechanism to adaptively select features and reduce
communication overhead. Due to the absence of suitable benchmark datasets, we
extend three datasets for evaluation: two virtual datasets (Air-to-Pred-Occ and
UAV3D-Occ) and one real-world dataset (GauUScene-Occ). Experiments results
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly
outperforming existing collaborative methods while reducing communication
overhead to only a fraction of previous approaches.

TL;DR: 提出H-EGL框架，结合自监督和人工指导的约束来增强注意力对齐，提高医学影像分类的泛化能力，在胸部X光分类任务中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在医学影像中表现优异，但容易学习虚假相关性导致偏见和泛化能力有限。人工-AI注意力对齐可缓解此问题，但依赖昂贵的监督标注。

Method: 提出混合解释引导学习(H-EGL)框架，结合自监督和人工指导约束。自监督组件利用类别区分性注意力，不依赖限制性先验，提升鲁棒性和灵活性。

Result: 在胸部X光分类任务中使用Vision Transformer验证，H-EGL优于两种最先进的解释引导学习方法，展现出更好的分类准确率和泛化能力，生成的注意力图与人类专家知识更一致。

Conclusion: H-EGL框架通过结合自监督和人工指导约束，有效提升了医学影像分类的泛化能力和注意力对齐质量，为减少模型偏见提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning models have demonstrated exceptional
performance in medical imaging by leveraging attention mechanisms for feature
representation and interpretability. However, these models are prone to
learning spurious correlations, leading to biases and limited generalization.
While human-AI attention alignment can mitigate these issues, it often depends
on costly manual supervision. In this work, we propose a Hybrid
Explanation-Guided Learning (H-EGL) framework that combines self-supervised and
human-guided constraints to enhance attention alignment and improve
generalization. The self-supervised component of H-EGL leverages
class-distinctive attention without relying on restrictive priors, promoting
robustness and flexibility. We validate our approach on chest X-ray
classification using the Vision Transformer (ViT), where H-EGL outperforms two
state-of-the-art Explanation-Guided Learning (EGL) methods, demonstrating
superior classification accuracy and generalization capability. Additionally,
it produces attention maps that are better aligned with human expertise.

TL;DR: IRIS是一个评估多模态大语言模型在"think with images"范式下能力的基准测试，包含1,204个视觉任务，涵盖5个领域，显示当前模型在整合视觉和通用工具方面表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要采用"think about images"范式，将图像视为静态输入，而现实应用中需要模型能够主动操作图像并与其他工具集成来解决复杂任务。

Method: 构建IRIS基准测试，包含1,204个挑战性视觉任务（603个单轮，601个多轮），涵盖5个不同领域，并配备详细评分标准进行系统评估。

Result: 当前MLLMs在需要有效整合视觉和通用工具的任务上表现困难，最强模型GPT-5-think仅达到18.68%通过率。不同模型表现出不同的工具使用行为。

Conclusion: IRIS作为首个专注于"think with images"的基准测试，为推进MLLMs的视觉智能提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied in
real-world scenarios where user-provided images are often imperfect, requiring
active image manipulations such as cropping, editing, or enhancement to uncover
salient visual cues. Beyond static visual perception, MLLMs must also think
with images: dynamically transforming visual content and integrating it with
other tools to solve complex tasks. However, this shift from treating vision as
passive context to a manipulable cognitive workspace remains underexplored.
Most existing benchmarks still follow a think about images paradigm, where
images are regarded as static inputs. To address this gap, we introduce IRIS,
an Interactive Reasoning with Images and Systems that evaluates MLLMs' ability
to perceive, transform, and reason across complex visual-textual tasks under
the think with images paradigm. IRIS comprises 1,204 challenging, open-ended
vision tasks (603 single-turn, 601 multi-turn) spanning across five diverse
domains, each paired with detailed rubrics to enable systematic evaluation. Our
evaluation shows that current MLLMs struggle with tasks requiring effective
integration of vision and general-purpose tools. Even the strongest model
(GPT-5-think) reaches only 18.68% pass rate. We further observe divergent
tool-use behaviors, with OpenAI models benefiting from diverse image
manipulations while Gemini-2.5-pro shows no improvement. By introducing the
first benchmark centered on think with images, IRIS offers critical insights
for advancing visual intelligence in MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在医疗AI中应用面临数据隐私限制，联邦学习可解决数据共享问题，但需要更好的个性化微调方法来充分利用多方数据。

Method: 使用正交LoRA适配器来解耦通用知识和客户端特定知识，在联邦学习框架下进行个性化微调。

Result: 在真实世界联邦医疗影像任务上的初步结果显示，该方法与当前联邦微调方法相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法为医疗领域基础模型的联邦微调提供了一种有效的个性化解决方案，能够平衡数据隐私保护和模型性能提升的需求。

Abstract: Foundation models open up new possibilities for the use of AI in healthcare.
However, even when pre-trained on health data, they still need to be fine-tuned
for specific downstream tasks. Furthermore, although foundation models reduce
the amount of training data required to achieve good performance, obtaining
sufficient data is still a challenge. This is due, in part, to restrictions on
sharing and aggregating data from different sources to protect patients'
privacy. One possible solution to this is to fine-tune foundation models via
federated learning across multiple participating clients (i.e., hospitals,
clinics, etc.). In this work, we propose a new personalized federated
fine-tuning method that learns orthogonal LoRA adapters to disentangle general
and client-specific knowledge, enabling each client to fully exploit both their
own data and the data of others. Our preliminary results on real-world
federated medical imaging tasks demonstrate that our approach is competitive
against current federated fine-tuning methods.

TL;DR: FlashVSR是首个基于扩散模型的实时视频超分辨率框架，通过三阶段蒸馏、局部约束稀疏注意力和微型条件解码器实现17 FPS的高效性能，在A100 GPU上处理768x1408视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在视频超分辨率应用中面临高延迟、计算量大和超高分辨率泛化能力差的问题，需要实现高效、可扩展且实时的解决方案。

Method: 提出三阶段蒸馏管道实现流式超分辨率、局部约束稀疏注意力减少冗余计算、微型条件解码器加速重建，并构建了包含12万视频和18万图像的大规模数据集VSR-120K。

Result: FlashVSR在超高分辨率下可靠扩展，达到最先进性能，相比之前的一步扩散VSR模型速度提升高达12倍。

Conclusion: FlashVSR使基于扩散模型的视频超分辨率变得实用，具备效率、可扩展性和实时性能，将发布代码、预训练模型和数据集促进未来研究。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced video restoration, but applying them
to real-world video super-resolution (VSR) remains challenging due to high
latency, prohibitive computation, and poor generalization to ultra-high
resolutions. Our goal in this work is to make diffusion-based VSR practical by
achieving efficiency, scalability, and real-time performance. To this end, we
propose FlashVSR, the first diffusion-based one-step streaming framework
towards real-time VSR. FlashVSR runs at approximately 17 FPS for 768x1408
videos on a single A100 GPU by combining three complementary innovations: (i) a
train-friendly three-stage distillation pipeline that enables streaming
super-resolution, (ii) locality-constrained sparse attention that cuts
redundant computation while bridging the train-test resolution gap, and (iii) a
tiny conditional decoder that accelerates reconstruction without sacrificing
quality. To support large-scale training, we also construct VSR-120K, a new
dataset with 120k videos and 180k images. Extensive experiments show that
FlashVSR scales reliably to ultra-high resolutions and achieves
state-of-the-art performance with up to 12x speedup over prior one-step
diffusion VSR models. We will release the code, pretrained models, and dataset
to foster future research in efficient diffusion-based VSR.

TL;DR: SPORTS框架通过整合视频全景分割、视觉里程计和场景渲染任务，解决了场景感知中的分割缺陷、动态物体干扰、数据稀疏性和视角限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有场景感知解决方案存在分割缺陷、动态物体干扰、传感器数据稀疏和视角限制等问题，需要更全面的场景理解方法。

Method: 提出SPORTS框架，集成VPS、VO和SR任务：VPS使用自适应注意力几何融合机制对齐跨帧特征；VO结合全景分割和光流图改进动态物体置信度估计；SR通过点云渲染生成神经场合成高保真视图。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的实验表明，基于注意力的特征融合在里程计、跟踪、分割和新视角合成任务上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: SPORTS框架通过任务间的紧密集成和迭代优化，实现了更全面的场景感知和理解，在多个任务上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: The scene perception, understanding, and simulation are fundamental
techniques for embodied-AI agents, while existing solutions are still prone to
segmentation deficiency, dynamic objects' interference, sensor data sparsity,
and view-limitation problems. This paper proposes a novel framework, named
SPORTS, for holistic scene understanding via tightly integrating Video Panoptic
Segmentation (VPS), Visual Odometry (VO), and Scene Rendering (SR) tasks into
an iterative and unified perspective. Firstly, VPS designs an adaptive
attention-based geometric fusion mechanism to align cross-frame features via
enrolling the pose, depth, and optical flow modality, which automatically
adjust feature maps for different decoding stages. And a post-matching strategy
is integrated to improve identities tracking. In VO, panoptic segmentation
results from VPS are combined with the optical flow map to improve the
confidence estimation of dynamic objects, which enhances the accuracy of the
camera pose estimation and completeness of the depth map generation via the
learning-based paradigm. Furthermore, the point-based rendering of SR is
beneficial from VO, transforming sparse point clouds into neural fields to
synthesize high-fidelity RGB views and twin panoptic views. Extensive
experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our attention-based
feature fusion outperforms most existing state-of-the-art methods on the
odometry, tracking, segmentation, and novel view synthesis tasks.

TL;DR: VQArt-Bench是一个针对文化遗产领域的新视觉问答基准，通过多智能体管道生成复杂多样的艺术分析问题，揭示了当前多模态大语言模型在深度视觉语义理解方面的显著局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA基准主要评估简单的句法结构和表面属性，无法评估深度语义理解，特别是在视觉艺术分析等复杂领域。这导致模型倾向于利用统计捷径而非进行真正的视觉推理。

Method: 使用新颖的多智能体管道，让专门化的智能体协作生成经过验证的、语言多样且细致的问题，构建了一个结构化的基准，涵盖符号意义、叙事和复杂视觉关系等理解维度。

Result: 对14个最先进MLLM的评估显示，当前模型存在显著局限性，包括在简单计数任务中的意外弱点，以及专有模型和开源模型之间的明显性能差距。

Conclusion: VQArt-Bench基准揭示了当前MLLM在深度视觉语义理解方面的不足，强调了开发更鲁棒视觉推理能力的必要性，特别是在复杂文化领域。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
capabilities in joint visual and linguistic tasks. However, existing Visual
Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks often fail to evaluate deep semantic
understanding, particularly in complex domains like visual art analysis.
Confined to simple syntactic structures and surface-level attributes, these
questions fail to capture the diversity and depth of human visual inquiry. This
limitation incentivizes models to exploit statistical shortcuts rather than
engage in visual reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce VQArt-Bench, a
new, large-scale VQA benchmark for the cultural heritage domain. This benchmark
is constructed using a novel multi-agent pipeline where specialized agents
collaborate to generate nuanced, validated, and linguistically diverse
questions. The resulting benchmark is structured along relevant visual
understanding dimensions that probe a model's ability to interpret symbolic
meaning, narratives, and complex visual relationships. Our evaluation of 14
state-of-the-art MLLMs on this benchmark reveals significant limitations in
current models, including a surprising weakness in simple counting tasks and a
clear performance gap between proprietary and open-source models.

*Wenpu Li,Bangyan Liao,Yi Zhou,Qi Xu,Pian Wan,Peidong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无监督框架E-MoFlow，通过隐式时空和几何正则化联合优化事件相机的自运动和光流估计，避免了显式深度估计，在无监督方法中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将光流和6-DoF自运动估计分开处理，但在事件相机中由于缺乏鲁棒的数据关联，这成为一个不适定问题。现有方法要么引入偏差和计算开销，要么容易陷入局部最优。

Method: 将相机自运动建模为连续样条，光流建模为隐式神经表示，通过归纳偏差嵌入时空一致性；结合微分几何约束引入结构-运动先验，避免显式深度估计。

Result: 在通用6-DoF运动场景中表现出良好的适应性，在无监督方法中达到最先进性能，甚至与有监督方法相竞争。

Conclusion: E-MoFlow通过隐式正则化在完全无监督范式下统一了自运动和光流估计，解决了事件相机中的不适定问题。

Abstract: The estimation of optical flow and 6-DoF ego-motion, two fundamental tasks in
3D vision, has typically been addressed independently. For neuromorphic vision
(e.g., event cameras), however, the lack of robust data association makes
solving the two problems separately an ill-posed challenge, especially in the
absence of supervision via ground truth. Existing works mitigate this
ill-posedness by either enforcing the smoothness of the flow field via an
explicit variational regularizer or leveraging explicit structure-and-motion
priors in the parametrization to improve event alignment. The former notably
introduces bias in results and computational overhead, while the latter, which
parametrizes the optical flow in terms of the scene depth and the camera
motion, often converges to suboptimal local minima. To address these issues, we
propose an unsupervised framework that jointly optimizes egomotion and optical
flow via implicit spatial-temporal and geometric regularization. First, by
modeling camera's egomotion as a continuous spline and optical flow as an
implicit neural representation, our method inherently embeds spatial-temporal
coherence through inductive biases. Second, we incorporate structure-and-motion
priors through differential geometric constraints, bypassing explicit depth
estimation while maintaining rigorous geometric consistency. As a result, our
framework (called E-MoFlow) unifies egomotion and optical flow estimation via
implicit regularization under a fully unsupervised paradigm. Experiments
demonstrate its versatility to general 6-DoF motion scenarios, achieving
state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods and competitive even
with supervised approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 头部运动在脑PET成像中会导致图像伪影和定量不准确，而基于硬件的运动跟踪在临床实践中应用受限。

Method: 使用交叉注意力机制的深度学习模型，通过监督学习从1秒3D PET原始数据预测刚性头部运动，利用现有动态PET扫描和外部硬件跟踪的金标准数据进行训练。

Result: 在两个PET扫描仪和四种放射性示踪剂上验证，DL-HMC++优于现有数据驱动方法，生成的运动校正图像与金标准硬件跟踪结果难以区分，区域定量分析差异小于1.2%。

Conclusion: DL-HMC++展示了数据驱动PET头部运动校正的潜力，可消除硬件跟踪负担，使运动校正技术更易于在临床环境中推广应用。

Abstract: Head movement poses a significant challenge in brain positron emission
tomography (PET) imaging, resulting in image artifacts and tracer uptake
quantification inaccuracies. Effective head motion estimation and correction
are crucial for precise quantitative image analysis and accurate diagnosis of
neurological disorders. Hardware-based motion tracking (HMT) has limited
applicability in real-world clinical practice. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a deep-learning head motion correction approach with cross-attention
(DL-HMC++) to predict rigid head motion from one-second 3D PET raw data.
DL-HMC++ is trained in a supervised manner by leveraging existing dynamic PET
scans with gold-standard motion measurements from external HMT. We evaluate
DL-HMC++ on two PET scanners (HRRT and mCT) and four radiotracers (18F-FDG,
18F-FPEB, 11C-UCB-J, and 11C-LSN3172176) to demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization of the approach in large cohort PET studies. Quantitative and
qualitative results demonstrate that DL-HMC++ consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art data-driven motion estimation methods, producing motion-free
images with clear delineation of brain structures and reduced motion artifacts
that are indistinguishable from gold-standard HMT. Brain region of interest
standard uptake value analysis exhibits average difference ratios between
DL-HMC++ and gold-standard HMT to be 1.2 plus-minus 0.5% for HRRT and 0.5
plus-minus 0.2% for mCT. DL-HMC++ demonstrates the potential for data-driven
PET head motion correction to remove the burden of HMT, making motion
correction accessible to clinical populations beyond research settings. The

Motivation: 现有的基于学习的特征上采样方法（如DINO或CLIP）需要为每个特征提取器重新训练，无法在推理时泛化到不同的特征类型。

Method: 提出了一种推理时特征无关的上采样架构，无需编码器特定训练，可应用于任何视觉特征。

Result: AnyUp在特征上采样方面达到了新的最先进水平，能够泛化到不同的特征类型，保持特征语义，并且高效易于应用于各种下游任务。

Conclusion: AnyUp提供了一种通用、高效的特征上采样解决方案，突破了现有方法需要特定训练的限制。

Abstract: We introduce AnyUp, a method for feature upsampling that can be applied to
any vision feature at any resolution, without encoder-specific training.
Existing learning-based upsamplers for features like DINO or CLIP need to be
re-trained for every feature extractor and thus do not generalize to different
feature types at inference time. In this work, we propose an inference-time
feature-agnostic upsampling architecture to alleviate this limitation and
improve upsampling quality. In our experiments, AnyUp sets a new state of the
art for upsampled features, generalizes to different feature types, and
preserves feature semantics while being efficient and easy to apply to a wide
range of downstream tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study and benchmark on Efficient
Perceptual Super-Resolution (EPSR). While significant progress has been made in
efficient PSNR-oriented super resolution, approaches focusing on perceptual
quality metrics remain relatively inefficient. Motivated by this gap, we aim to
replicate or improve the perceptual results of Real-ESRGAN while meeting strict
efficiency constraints: a maximum of 5M parameters and 2000 GFLOPs, calculated
for an input size of 960x540 pixels. The proposed solutions were evaluated on a
novel dataset consisting of 500 test images of 4K resolution, each degraded
using multiple degradation types, without providing the original high-quality
counterparts. This design aims to reflect realistic deployment conditions and
serves as a diverse and challenging benchmark. The top-performing approach
manages to outperform Real-ESRGAN across all benchmark datasets, demonstrating
the potential of efficient methods in the perceptual domain. This paper
establishes the modern baselines for efficient perceptual super resolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通常只能密集采样单一场景动态实现，需要能够表示多模态场景运动及其对物理交互依赖性的方法。

Method: 提出FPT框架，基于稀疏交互条件直接预测局部运动分布，提供可解释的运动表示。

Result: 在密集面部运动生成任务中，通用预训练模型超越专用基线；在强分布外任务中微调后，在关节物体运动估计中显著优于域内方法；在基于pokes的运动部件分割任务中表现竞争力。

Conclusion: FPT提供了灵活且多功能的场景动态预测方法，能够处理多模态运动并适应各种下游任务。

Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of a physical scene involves reasoning about the
diverse ways it can potentially change, especially as a result of local
interactions. We present the Flow Poke Transformer (FPT), a novel framework for
directly predicting the distribution of local motion, conditioned on sparse
interactions termed "pokes". Unlike traditional methods that typically only
enable dense sampling of a single realization of scene dynamics, FPT provides
an interpretable directly accessible representation of multi-modal scene
motion, its dependency on physical interactions and the inherent uncertainties
of scene dynamics. We also evaluate our model on several downstream tasks to
enable comparisons with prior methods and highlight the flexibility of our
approach. On dense face motion generation, our generic pre-trained model
surpasses specialized baselines. FPT can be fine-tuned in strongly
out-of-distribution tasks such as synthetic datasets to enable significant
improvements over in-domain methods in articulated object motion estimation.
Additionally, predicting explicit motion distributions directly enables our
method to achieve competitive performance on tasks like moving part
segmentation from pokes which further demonstrates the versatility of our FPT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有统一多模态模型存在视觉理解能力无法有效转移到视觉生成的问题，模型能正确理解图像却无法从文本提示生成忠实图像。

Method: 设计了全局-局部双奖励系统：全局奖励确保整体视觉语义和布局正确性，局部奖励细化细粒度对象级保真度。

Conclusion: 建立了一个新范式，使统一多模态模型的理解模块能够通过自奖励来指导和增强自身的生成能力。

Abstract: Recently, remarkable progress has been made in Unified Multimodal Models
(UMMs), which integrate vision-language generation and understanding
capabilities within a single framework. However, a significant gap exists where
a model's strong visual understanding often fails to transfer to its visual
generation. A model might correctly understand an image based on user
instructions, yet be unable to generate a faithful image from text prompts.
This phenomenon directly raises a compelling question: Can a model achieve
self-improvement by using its understanding module to reward its generation
module? To bridge this gap and achieve self-improvement, we introduce SRUM, a
self-rewarding post-training framework that can be directly applied to existing
UMMs of various designs. SRUM creates a feedback loop where the model's own
understanding module acts as an internal ``evaluator'', providing corrective
signals to improve its generation module, without requiring additional
human-labeled data. To ensure this feedback is comprehensive, we designed a
global-local dual reward system. To tackle the inherent structural complexity
of images, this system offers multi-scale guidance: a \textbf{global reward}
ensures the correctness of the overall visual semantics and layout, while a
\textbf{local reward} refines fine-grained, object-level fidelity. SRUM leads
to powerful capabilities and shows strong generalization, boosting performance
on T2I-CompBench from 82.18 to \textbf{88.37} and on T2I-ReasonBench from 43.82
to \textbf{46.75}. Overall, our work establishes a powerful new paradigm for
enabling a UMMs' understanding module to guide and enhance its own generation
via self-rewarding.

### [83] [UniFusion: Vision-Language Model as Unified Encoder in Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12789)
*Kevin Li,Manuel Brack,Sudeep Katakol,Hareesh Ravi,Ajinkya Kale*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniFusion是一个基于扩散的生成模型，使用冻结的大型视觉语言模型作为统一多模态编码器，通过层注意力池化机制提取文本和视觉token的语义和细节信息，实现跨模态知识转移和推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉生成架构通常使用独立的图像和文本编码器，限制了扩散模型的跨模态推理和知识转移能力。现有解决方案要么计算资源需求大，要么需要大规模数据训练，限制了可访问性。

Method: 提出Layerwise Attention Pooling机制从冻结VLM中提取多层级信息；开发VERIFI方法，在模型内提示重写时仅使用VLM生成的文本token来条件化扩散变换器；通过编辑任务微调实现跨模态知识转移。

Result: LAP在文本-图像对齐方面优于其他浅层融合架构；编辑任务微调不仅改善了生成质量，还展现出强大的泛化能力，单图像编辑训练可零样本泛化到多图像参考。

Conclusion: UniFusion的统一编码器设计证明了跨模态知识转移的有效性，为生成模型提供了更强的推理能力和灵活性，同时减少了计算资源需求。

Abstract: Although recent advances in visual generation have been remarkable, most
existing architectures still depend on distinct encoders for images and text.
This separation constrains diffusion models' ability to perform cross-modal
reasoning and knowledge transfer. Prior attempts to bridge this gap often use
the last layer information from VLM, employ multiple visual encoders, or train
large unified models jointly for text and image generation, which demands
substantial computational resources and large-scale data, limiting its
accessibility.We present UniFusion, a diffusion-based generative model
conditioned on a frozen large vision-language model (VLM) that serves as a
unified multimodal encoder. At the core of UniFusion is the Layerwise Attention
Pooling (LAP) mechanism that extracts both high level semantics and low level
details from text and visual tokens of a frozen VLM to condition a diffusion
generative model. We demonstrate that LAP outperforms other shallow fusion
architectures on text-image alignment for generation and faithful transfer of
visual information from VLM to the diffusion model which is key for editing. We
propose VLM-Enabled Rewriting Injection with Flexibile Inference (VERIFI),
which conditions a diffusion transformer (DiT) only on the text tokens
generated by the VLM during in-model prompt rewriting. VERIFI combines the
alignment of the conditioning distribution with the VLM's reasoning
capabilities for increased capabilities and flexibility at inference. In
addition, finetuning on editing task not only improves text-image alignment for
generation, indicative of cross-modality knowledge transfer, but also exhibits
tremendous generalization capabilities. Our model when trained on single image
editing, zero-shot generalizes to multiple image references further motivating
the unified encoder design of UniFusion.

*Long Cui,Weiyun Wang,Jie Shao,Zichen Wen,Gen Luo,Linfeng Zhang,Yanting Zhang,Yu Qiao,Wenhai Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ViCO方法，通过根据图像语义复杂度动态调整视觉token数量来降低多模态大语言模型的推理成本，最多可减少50%的视觉token同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型由于图像输入引入的额外视觉token导致推理成本增加，需要更高效的视觉表示方法。

Method: 使用多个具有不同图像压缩率的MLP连接器，根据图像语义复杂度对视觉token进行下采样，通过最小化不同MLP连接器条件下响应的KL散度进行训练，在推理时使用视觉分辨率路由器自动选择每个图像块的最佳压缩率。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法最多可减少50%的视觉token数量，同时保持模型的感知、推理和OCR能力。

Conclusion: ViCO方法为开发更高效的多模态大语言模型做出了贡献，代码和模型将开源以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from increased
inference costs due to the additional vision tokens introduced by image inputs.
In this work, we propose Visual Consistency Learning (ViCO), a novel training
algorithm that enables the model to represent images of varying semantic
complexities using different numbers of vision tokens. The key idea behind our
method is to employ multiple MLP connectors, each with a different image
compression ratio, to downsample the vision tokens based on the semantic
complexity of the image. During training, we minimize the KL divergence between
the responses conditioned on different MLP connectors. At inference time, we
introduce an image router, termed Visual Resolution Router (ViR), that
automatically selects the appropriate compression rate for each image patch.
Compared with existing dynamic high-resolution strategies, which adjust the
number of visual tokens based on image resolutions, our method dynamically
adapts the number of visual tokens according to semantic complexity.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can reduce the number of
vision tokens by up to 50% while maintaining the model's perception, reasoning,
and OCR capabilities. We hope this work will contribute to the development of
more efficient MLLMs. The code and models will be released to facilitate future
research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CuMPerLay是一种可微分的向量化层，将立方多参数持久性(CMP)集成到深度学习管道中，通过分解CMP为可学习的单参数持久性组合，为图像分析提供稳健的拓扑特征向量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 立方多参数持久性(CMP)为图像拓扑分析提供了强大方法，但由于多过滤结构的复杂性和CMP向量化的困难，其应用受到限制。

Method: 提出新算法向量化立方复形的多参数同调，将CMP分解为可学习的单参数持久性组合，双过滤函数联合学习，确保可微性。

Result: 在基准医学影像和计算机视觉数据集上的实验显示，CuMPerLay在分类和分割性能上表现优异，特别是在数据有限的情况下。

Conclusion: CuMPerLay为将全局结构信息集成到深度网络中提供了有前景的方向，适用于结构化图像分析。

Abstract: We present CuMPerLay, a novel differentiable vectorization layer that enables
the integration of Cubical Multiparameter Persistence (CMP) into deep learning
pipelines. While CMP presents a natural and powerful way to topologically work
with images, its use is hindered by the complexity of multifiltration
structures as well as the vectorization of CMP. In face of these challenges, we
introduce a new algorithm for vectorizing MP homologies of cubical complexes.
Our CuMPerLay decomposes the CMP into a combination of individual, learnable
single-parameter persistence, where the bifiltration functions are jointly
learned. Thanks to the differentiability, its robust topological feature
vectors can be seamlessly used within state-of-the-art architectures such as
Swin Transformers. We establish theoretical guarantees for the stability of our
vectorization under generalized Wasserstein metrics. Our experiments on
benchmark medical imaging and computer vision datasets show the benefit
CuMPerLay on classification and segmentation performance, particularly in
limited-data scenarios. Overall, CuMPerLay offers a promising direction for
integrating global structural information into deep networks for structured
image analysis.

TL;DR: 提出DriveVLA-W0训练范式，通过世界建模预测未来图像来解决VLA模型的监督不足问题，显著提升驾驶智能性能并放大数据缩放定律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA模型存在监督不足问题：巨大的模型容量仅由稀疏、低维度的动作监督，导致其表示能力未被充分利用。

Method: 采用世界建模预测未来图像，为自回归和扩散两种VLA架构分别设计相应的世界模型，并引入轻量级动作专家解决实时部署的推理延迟问题。

Result: 在NAVSIM v1/v2基准测试和680倍更大的内部数据集上，DriveVLA-W0显著优于BEV和VLA基线方法，并放大了数据缩放定律。

Conclusion: 世界建模为VLA模型提供了密集的自监督信号，有效学习驾驶环境的底层动态，是实现更通用驾驶智能的有前景路径。

Abstract: Scaling Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models on large-scale data offers a
promising path to achieving a more generalized driving intelligence. However,
VLA models are limited by a ``supervision deficit'': the vast model capacity is
supervised by sparse, low-dimensional actions, leaving much of their
representational power underutilized. To remedy this, we propose
\textbf{DriveVLA-W0}, a training paradigm that employs world modeling to
predict future images. This task generates a dense, self-supervised signal that
compels the model to learn the underlying dynamics of the driving environment.
We showcase the paradigm's versatility by instantiating it for two dominant VLA
archetypes: an autoregressive world model for VLAs that use discrete visual
tokens, and a diffusion world model for those operating on continuous visual
features. Building on the rich representations learned from world modeling, we
introduce a lightweight action expert to address the inference latency for
real-time deployment. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM v1/v2 benchmark and a
680x larger in-house dataset demonstrate that DriveVLA-W0 significantly
outperforms BEV and VLA baselines. Crucially, it amplifies the data scaling
law, showing that performance gains accelerate as the training dataset size
increases.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rex-Omni是一个3B规模的多模态大语言模型，在目标检测任务上实现了与回归模型相当或更优的性能，通过量化坐标表示、多数据引擎和两阶段训练流程解决了MLLM在目标检测中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统坐标回归模型主导目标检测领域，而现有的MLLM方法面临召回率低、重复预测、坐标不对齐等问题，需要弥合这一差距。

Method: 1) 使用特殊token表示量化坐标；2) 构建多数据引擎生成高质量标注数据；3) 采用两阶段训练流程：监督微调+基于GRPO的强化学习后训练。

Result: 在COCO和LVIS基准测试中，Rex-Omni在零样本设置下达到或超过回归模型的性能，并具备对象引用、指向、视觉提示等多种能力。

Conclusion: Rex-Omni为更通用和语言感知的视觉感知系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Object detection has long been dominated by traditional coordinate
regression-based models, such as YOLO, DETR, and Grounding DINO. Although
recent efforts have attempted to leverage MLLMs to tackle this task, they face
challenges like low recall rate, duplicate predictions, coordinate
misalignment, etc. In this work, we bridge this gap and propose Rex-Omni, a
3B-scale MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art object perception performance. On
benchmarks like COCO and LVIS, Rex-Omni attains performance comparable to or
exceeding regression-based models (e.g., DINO, Grounding DINO) in a zero-shot
setting. This is enabled by three key designs: 1) Task Formulation: we use
special tokens to represent quantized coordinates from 0 to 999, reducing the
model's learning difficulty and improving token efficiency for coordinate
prediction; 2) Data Engines: we construct multiple data engines to generate
high-quality grounding, referring, and pointing data, providing semantically
rich supervision for training; \3) Training Pipelines: we employ a two-stage
training process, combining supervised fine-tuning on 22 million data with
GRPO-based reinforcement post-training. This RL post-training leverages
geometry-aware rewards to effectively bridge the discrete-to-continuous
coordinate prediction gap, improve box accuracy, and mitigate undesirable
behaviors like duplicate predictions that stem from the teacher-guided nature
of the initial SFT stage. Beyond conventional detection, Rex-Omni's inherent
language understanding enables versatile capabilities such as object referring,
pointing, visual prompting, GUI grounding, spatial referring, OCR and
key-pointing, all systematically evaluated on dedicated benchmarks. We believe
that Rex-Omni paves the way for more versatile and language-aware visual
perception systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在流程僵化、搜索调用过多、搜索查询构建不佳等问题，导致效率低下和结果不理想。需要解决信息检索和知识密集型用户查询的动态需求。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：冷启动监督微调阶段和在线强化学习优化。创建了DeepMMSearchVQA多模态VQA数据集，包含多样化的多跳查询，教导模型何时搜索、搜索什么、使用哪个搜索工具以及如何对检索信息进行推理。

Result: 在多个知识密集型基准测试中进行了广泛实验，证明了该方法的优越性。

Conclusion: 该方法为推进多模态网络搜索提供了有价值的见解，能够更有效地处理动态变化的真实世界信息。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-world applications require
access to external knowledge sources and must remain responsive to the dynamic
and ever-changing real-world information in order to address
information-seeking and knowledge-intensive user queries. Existing approaches,
such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods, search agents, and search
equipped MLLMs, often suffer from rigid pipelines, excessive search calls, and
poorly constructed search queries, which result in inefficiencies and
suboptimal outcomes. To address these limitations, we present DeepMMSearch-R1,
the first multimodal LLM capable of performing on-demand, multi-turn web
searches and dynamically crafting queries for both image and text search tools.
Specifically, DeepMMSearch-R1 can initiate web searches based on relevant crops
of the input image making the image search more effective, and can iteratively
adapt text search queries based on retrieved information, thereby enabling
self-reflection and self-correction. Our approach relies on a two-stage
training pipeline: a cold start supervised finetuning phase followed by an
online reinforcement learning optimization. For training, we introduce
DeepMMSearchVQA, a novel multimodal VQA dataset created through an automated
pipeline intermixed with real-world information from web search tools. This
dataset contains diverse, multi-hop queries that integrate textual and visual
information, teaching the model when to search, what to search for, which
search tool to use and how to reason over the retrieved information. We conduct
extensive experiments across a range of knowledge-intensive benchmarks to
demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Finally, we analyze the results
and provide insights that are valuable for advancing multimodal web-search.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProtoDoctor是一个ICU死亡率预测框架，通过原型学习实现内在可解释性，整合了临床病程识别、人口异质性和预后意识三个ICU决策实践的关键要素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICU死亡率预测不仅需要预测准确性，还需要可解释性来建立临床信任和满足监管要求。现有方法主要关注人口异质性，忽视了临床病程识别和预后意识。

Method: 提出ProtoDoctor框架，包含两个关键创新模块：预后临床病程识别模块（通过原型学习和新型正则化机制实现临床病程识别和预后意识）和人口异质性识别模块（通过队列特定原型和风险调整建模人口异质性）。

Result: 广泛的实证评估表明ProtoDoctor在预测准确性上优于最先进的基线方法。人工评估进一步证实其解释更具临床意义、可信度更高，且在ICU实践中更具适用性。

Conclusion: ProtoDoctor成功整合了ICU决策实践的三个关键要素，在保持高预测准确性的同时提供了临床上有意义的解释，为ICU死亡率预测提供了更全面的解决方案。

Abstract: Intensive Care Unit (ICU) mortality prediction, which estimates a patient's
mortality status at discharge using EHRs collected early in an ICU admission,
is vital in critical care. For this task, predictive accuracy alone is
insufficient; interpretability is equally essential for building clinical trust
and meeting regulatory standards, a topic that has attracted significant
attention in information system research. Accordingly, an ideal solution should
enable intrinsic interpretability and align its reasoning with three key
elements of the ICU decision-making practices: clinical course identification,
demographic heterogeneity, and prognostication awareness. However, conventional
approaches largely focus on demographic heterogeneity, overlooking clinical
course identification and prognostication awareness. Recent prototype learning
methods address clinical course identification, yet the integration of the
other elements into such frameworks remains underexplored. To address these
gaps, we propose ProtoDoctor, a novel ICU mortality prediction framework that
delivers intrinsic interpretability while integrating all three elements of the
ICU decision-making practices into its reasoning process. Methodologically,
ProtoDoctor features two key innovations: the Prognostic Clinical Course
Identification module and the Demographic Heterogeneity Recognition module. The
former enables the identification of clinical courses via prototype learning
and achieves prognostication awareness using a novel regularization mechanism.
The latter models demographic heterogeneity through cohort-specific prototypes
and risk adjustments. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that
ProtoDoctor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.
Human evaluations further confirm that its interpretations are more clinically
meaningful, trustworthy, and applicable in ICU practice.

Motivation: 当前最先进模型依赖固定问题集进行昂贵的在线强化学习或专家迭代，导致训练效率低下且难以处理复杂问题。

Method: GAR框架包含问题生成器和求解器，在对抗循环中联合训练，通过隐式课程学习机制使任务难度与证明者能力同步演进。

Result: 在MiniF2F-Test基准上平均相对提升4.20%的pass@32，ProofNet-Test上DeepSeek-Prover-V2的pass@32从22.58%提升至25.81%。

Conclusion: GAR不仅提升了形式化证明的性能，还建立了可验证环境下问题生成与求解协同进化的一般强化学习范式。

Abstract: Solving math problems through verifiable languages such as Lean has
significantly impacted both the mathematics and computer science communities.
Current state-of-the-art models are often trained with expensive online
Reinforcement Learning (RL) or expert iteration. However, these approaches rely
on fixed problem sets, which causes inefficient training and limits the model
to tackle complex problems. To overcome these limitations, we propose GAR:
Generative Adversarial Reinforcement learning, a comprehensive RL training
framework that jointly trains the problem composer and solver in an adversarial
loop. GAR introduces an implicit curriculum learning mechanism, which aligns
task difficulty with the prover's evolving capability. It thereby improves the
training efficiency and enables stronger performance of proving advanced
theorems. Experiments show that with GAR training, Goedel-Prover-V2-8B and
DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B achieve an average relative improvement in pass@32 of
4.20% on MiniF2F-Test benchmark, while DeepSeek-Prover-V2's pass@32 on
ProofNet-Test increases from 22.58% to 25.81%. Beyond formal proving, GAR
establishes a general RL paradigm for co-evolution of problem generation and
solving under verifiable environments.

Motivation: 传统PIELM在处理包含高频和变频行为的偏微分方程时面临挑战，需要改进以有效捕捉目标解的不同频率分量。

Method: 1) 将傅里叶特征映射变体集成到ELM中作为傅里叶基激活函数；2) 为隐藏神经元分配频率系数集；3) 开发基于ELM输出权重分布监测的创新初始化方法。

Conclusion: GFF-PIELM成功扩展了PIELM解决高频和变频PDE的能力，其初始化策略可启发其他物理信息机器学习框架的改进。

Abstract: Conventional physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM) often faces
challenges in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) involving
high-frequency and variable-frequency behaviors. To address these challenges,
we propose a general Fourier feature physics-informed extreme learning machine
(GFF-PIELM). We demonstrate that directly concatenating multiple Fourier
feature mappings (FFMs) and an extreme learning machine (ELM) network makes it
difficult to determine frequency-related hyperparameters. Fortunately, we find
an alternative to establish the GFF-PIELM in three main steps. First, we
integrate a variation of FFM into ELM as the Fourier-based activation function,
so there is still one hidden layer in the GFF-PIELM framework. Second, we
assign a set of frequency coefficients to the hidden neurons, which enables ELM
network to capture diverse frequency components of target solutions. Finally,
we develop an innovative, straightforward initialization method for these
hyperparameters by monitoring the distribution of ELM output weights. GFF-PIELM
not only retains the high accuracy, efficiency, and simplicity of the PIELM
framework but also inherits the ability of FFMs to effectively handle
high-frequency problems. We carry out five case studies with a total of ten
numerical examples to highlight the feasibility and validity of the proposed
GFF-PIELM, involving high frequency, variable frequency, multi-scale behaviour,
irregular boundary and inverse problems. Compared to conventional PIELM, the
GFF-PIELM approach significantly improves predictive accuracy without
additional cost in training time and architecture complexity. Our results
confirm that that PIELM can be extended to solve high-frequency and
variable-frequency PDEs with high accuracy, and our initialization strategy may
further inspire advances in other physics-informed machine learning (PIML)
frameworks.

Motivation: 节点级异常检测面临结构模式和特征分布多样性的挑战，在欺诈检测、网络安全等应用中至关重要。现有方法难以捕捉复杂的异常模式。

Method: 使用欧几里得和双曲GNN分别处理原始特征和结构特征（随机游走和度），通过多图自编码器框架和对比学习目标对齐两种几何空间的嵌入，识别难以协调的节点作为异常。

Abstract: Node-level anomaly detection (NAD) is challenging due to diverse structural
patterns and feature distributions. As such, NAD is a critical task with
several applications which range from fraud detection, cybersecurity, to
recommendation systems. We introduce Janus, a framework that jointly leverages
Euclidean and Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks to capture complementary aspects
of node representations. Each node is described by two views, composed by the
original features and structural features derived from random walks and
degrees, then embedded into Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces. A multi
Graph-Autoencoder framework, equipped with a contrastive learning objective as
regularization term, aligns the embeddings across the Euclidean and Hyperbolic
spaces, highlighting nodes whose views are difficult to reconcile and are thus
likely anomalous. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that Janus
consistently outperforms shallow and deep baselines, empirically demonstrating
that combining multiple geometric representations provides a robust and
effective approach for identifying subtle and complex anomalies in graphs.

Abstract: Graph foundation models represent a transformative paradigm for learning
transferable representations across diverse graph domains. Recent methods
leverage large language models to unify graph and text modalities into a shared
representation space using contrastive learning. However, systematic
evaluations reveal significant performance degradation at structural boundaries
where distinct topological patterns converge, with accuracy losses exceeding 20
percentage points. This issue arises from a key limitation: current methods
assume all graph structures can be encoded within a single Euclidean space. In
reality, tree structures require hyperbolic geometry to preserve hierarchical
branching, while cyclic patterns depend on spherical geometry for closure
properties. At structural boundaries, nodes experience conflicting geometric
constraints that uniform encoding spaces cannot resolve. This raises a crucial
challenge: \textbf{Can alignment frameworks be designed to respect the
intrinsic geometric diversity of graph structures?} We introduce
\textbf{GraphShaper}, a geometry-aware framework that enhances graph encoding
through multi-geometric specialization. Our approach employs expert networks
tailored to different geometric spaces, dynamically computing fusion weights to
adaptively integrate geometric properties based on local structural
characteristics. This adaptive fusion preserves structural integrity before
alignment with text embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
GraphShaper achieves 9.47\% accuracy improvements on citation networks and
7.63\% on social networks in zero-shot settings.

Abstract: Generative AI can be framed as the problem of learning a model that maps
simple reference measures into complex data distributions, and it has recently
found a strong connection to the classical theory of the Schr\"odinger bridge
problems (SBPs) due partly to their common nature of interpolating between
prescribed marginals via entropy-regularized stochastic dynamics. However, the
classical SBP enforces hard terminal constraints, which often leads to
instability in practical implementations, especially in high-dimensional or
data-scarce regimes. To address this challenge, we follow the idea of the
so-called soft-constrained Schr\"odinger bridge problem (SCSBP), in which the
terminal constraint is replaced by a general penalty function. This relaxation
leads to a more flexible stochastic control formulation of McKean-Vlasov type.
  We establish the existence of optimal solutions for all penalty levels and
prove that, as the penalty grows, both the controls and value functions
converge to those of the classical SBP at a linear rate. Our analysis builds on
Doob's h-transform representations, the stability results of Schr\"odinger
potentials, Gamma-convergence, and a novel fixed-point argument that couples an
optimization problem over the space of measures with an auxiliary entropic
optimal transport problem. These results not only provide the first
quantitative convergence guarantees for soft-constrained bridges but also shed
light on how penalty regularization enables robust generative modeling,
fine-tuning, and transfer learning.

TL;DR: 本文提出H4G框架，通过降低双曲嵌入半径来解决文本属性图中的过抽象问题，在异配图和同配图上分别实现了12.8%和8.4%的零样本性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理需要细粒度模式识别的任务时，特别是在异配图上表现不佳。通过实证和理论分析，发现存在过抽象问题：当前方法在过大的双曲半径下操作，将多尺度结构信息压缩成统一的高层抽象，导致关键局部模式丢失。

Method: 提出H4G框架，使用可学习的块对角缩放矩阵和Möbius矩阵乘法系统性地降低嵌入半径，恢复对细粒度模式的访问，同时以最小计算开销保持全局感受能力。

Result: 实验显示H4G在异配图上实现12.8%的零样本性能提升，在同配图上实现8.4%的提升，证实半径减少能够实现忠实的多尺度表示。

Conclusion: 通过降低双曲嵌入半径，H4G框架能够更好地保留细粒度结构细节，显著推进零样本图学习性能，特别是在需要精细模式识别的异配图上表现突出。

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs are widely used across domains, offering rich
opportunities for zero-shot learning via graph-text alignment. However,
existing methods struggle with tasks requiring fine-grained pattern
recognition, particularly on heterophilic graphs. Through empirical and
theoretical analysis, we identify an \textbf{over-abstraction problem}: current
approaches operate at excessively large hyperbolic radii, compressing
multi-scale structural information into uniform high-level abstractions. This
abstraction-induced information loss obscures critical local patterns essential
for accurate predictions. By analyzing embeddings in hyperbolic space, we
demonstrate that optimal graph learning requires \textbf{faithful preservation}
of fine-grained structural details, better retained by representations
positioned closer to the origin. To address this, we propose \textbf{H4G}, a
framework that systematically reduces embedding radii using learnable
block-diagonal scaling matrices and M\"obius matrix multiplication. This
approach restores access to fine-grained patterns while maintaining global
receptive ability with minimal computational overhead. Experiments show H4G
achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance with \textbf{12.8\%}
improvement on heterophilic graphs and \textbf{8.4\%} on homophilic graphs,
confirming that radius reduction enables faithful multi-scale representation
for advancing zero-shot graph learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CART是首个增强决策变换器在对抗性随机游戏中鲁棒性的框架，通过将每个阶段的交互建模为阶段博弈，基于NashQ值生成同时具有对抗鲁棒性和保守性的策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Transformer架构已应用于序列决策，但其在对抗性环境下的鲁棒性尚未充分探索，需要开发能够抵御对抗攻击的强化学习方法。

Method: 将每个时间步的交互建模为阶段博弈，定义基于后续状态期望最大值的收益函数，通过基于阶段博弈NashQ值调节Transformer策略来生成鲁棒策略。

Result: CART在对抗性随机游戏中实现了更准确的极小极大值估计，并在各种环境下持续获得更优的最坏情况回报。

Conclusion: CART框架成功增强了决策变换器的对抗鲁棒性，为序列建模方法在对抗环境中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The Transformer, a highly expressive architecture for sequence modeling, has
recently been adapted to solve sequential decision-making, most notably through
the Decision Transformer (DT), which learns policies by conditioning on desired
returns. Yet, the adversarial robustness of reinforcement learning methods
based on sequence modeling remains largely unexplored. Here we introduce the
Conservative Adversarially Robust Decision Transformer (CART), to our knowledge
the first framework designed to enhance the robustness of DT in adversarial
stochastic games. We formulate the interaction between the protagonist and the
adversary at each stage as a stage game, where the payoff is defined as the
expected maximum value over subsequent states, thereby explicitly incorporating
stochastic state transitions. By conditioning Transformer policies on the NashQ
value derived from these stage games, CART generates policy that are
simultaneously less exploitable (adversarially robust) and conservative to
transition uncertainty. Empirically, CART achieves more accurate minimax value
estimation and consistently attains superior worst-case returns across a range
of adversarial stochastic games.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解训练数据如何影响模型预测行为对分析和改进机器学习系统至关重要，但现有方法在大模型上存在精度低或计算成本高的问题。

Method: 使用零阶近似方法，仅依赖训练和测试数据上的损失值以及模型检查点，无需梯度信息，适用于非可微损失函数。

Result: 该方法在计算效率上显著优于现有方法，在估计自影响方面达到更高精度，在训练-测试影响估计方面达到相当或更好的精度。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了可扩展且实用的训练数据分析，能够有效评估数据如何塑造模型行为。

Abstract: A critical aspect of analyzing and improving modern machine learning systems
lies in understanding how individual training examples influence a model's
predictive behavior. Estimating this influence enables critical applications,
including data selection and model debugging; in particular, self-influence,
which quantifies the influence of a training point on itself, has found many
uses in data quality assessment and outlier detection. Existing methods for
measuring data influence, however, are often impractical for large models due
to low accuracy or prohibitive computational costs: most approaches either
provide poor approximations or rely on gradients and inverse-Hessian
computations that remain challenging to scale. In this work, we introduce a
highly efficient zeroth-order approximation for estimating the influence of
training data that requires only a fraction of the time and memory footprint of
prior methods. Notably, our method relies solely on loss values of intermediate
checkpoints on the training and test data, along with the checkpoints
themselves, making it broadly applicable even when the loss function of
interest is non-differentiable. Beyond its computational efficiency, our
approach achieves superior accuracy in estimating self-influence and comparable
or improved accuracy in estimating train-test influence for fine-tuned large
language models, enabling scalable and practical analysis of how training data
shapes model behavior.

TL;DR: 提出Boundary Guidance方法，通过强化学习微调生成模型，使其远离安全分类器的决策边界，从而同时提高安全性和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通过微调生成模型来降低被安全分类器过滤的概率，但这往往使模型产生靠近分类器决策边界的样本，增加了假阳性和假阴性错误。

Method: 使用强化学习进行微调，明确引导生成远离分类器的边界区域，避免产生边界附近的模糊样本。

Result: 在越狱和模糊提示的基准测试中，Boundary Guidance提高了输出的安全性和实用性，经LLM-as-a-Judge评估验证有效。

Conclusion: 该方法在不同模型规模和奖励设计下都表现出鲁棒性，为解决生成模型与安全分类器配合的问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Generative models are increasingly paired with safety classifiers that filter
harmful or undesirable outputs. A common strategy is to fine-tune the generator
to reduce the probability of being filtered, but this can be suboptimal: it
often pushes the model toward producing samples near the classifier's decision
boundary, increasing both false positives and false negatives. We propose
Boundary Guidance, a reinforcement learning fine-tuning method that explicitly
steers generation away from the classifier's margin. On a benchmark of
jailbreak and ambiguous prompts, Boundary Guidance improves both the safety and
the utility of outputs, as judged by LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations. Comprehensive
ablations across model scales and reward designs demonstrate the robustness of
our approach.

TL;DR: WaveletDiff是一个新颖的扩散模型框架，直接在时间序列的小波系数上训练，利用其多分辨率结构生成高质量合成时间序列数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时间序列生成模型局限于时域或频域，难以复现真实世界时间序列固有的多尺度结构，而大型高质量时间序列数据集稀缺。

Method: 结合每个分解级别的专用transformer和跨级别注意力机制，通过自适应门控实现时频尺度间的选择性信息交换，并基于Parseval定理加入能量保持约束。

Result: 在六个真实世界数据集上的综合测试表明，WaveletDiff在五个不同性能指标上始终优于最先进的时域和频域生成方法，判别分数和Context-FID分数平均比次优基线小3倍。

Conclusion: WaveletDiff通过在小波域训练扩散模型，有效利用了时间序列的多分辨率结构，在生成质量上显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Time series are ubiquitous in many applications that involve forecasting,
classification and causal inference tasks, such as healthcare, finance, audio
signal processing and climate sciences. Still, large, high-quality time series
datasets remain scarce. Synthetic generation can address this limitation;
however, current models confined either to the time or frequency domains
struggle to reproduce the inherently multi-scaled structure of real-world time
series. We introduce WaveletDiff, a novel framework that trains diffusion
models directly on wavelet coefficients to exploit the inherent
multi-resolution structure of time series data. The model combines dedicated
transformers for each decomposition level with cross-level attention mechanisms
that enable selective information exchange between temporal and frequency
scales through adaptive gating. It also incorporates energy preservation
constraints for individual levels based on Parseval's theorem to preserve
spectral fidelity throughout the diffusion process. Comprehensive tests across
six real-world datasets from energy, finance, and neuroscience domains
demonstrate that WaveletDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
time-domain and frequency-domain generative methods on both short and long time
series across five diverse performance metrics. For example, WaveletDiff
achieves discriminative scores and Context-FID scores that are $3\times$
smaller on average than the second-best baseline across all datasets.

Method: 使用bAbI推理任务作为目标，应用合成数据生成技术，系统评估不同总令牌预算和回放比例配置对任务掌握和知识保留的影响。

Result: 实验发现了一个最优配置，能够平衡任务特定性能与通用知识保留，并基于此提供了基于计算预算选择回放比例的实证指导。

Conclusion: 研究为实践者提供了在显著减少训练成本的同时实现强大任务适应的回放比例选择指南。

Abstract: Adapting language models to new tasks through continued pretraining faces a
fundamental trade-off: models must learn new capabilities while avoiding
catastrophic forgetting of existing knowledge. While prior work has studied
synthetic data generation techniques, the optimal replay ratios for balancing
task performance and knowledge retention under computational constraints remain
poorly understood. We present a comprehensive empirical study investigating the
interplay between replay ratio configuration and computational budget when
adapting language models to new tasks. Using the bAbI reasoning tasks as our
target objective, we apply synthetic data generation and systematically
evaluate different total token budgets and replay ratio configurations. We
analyze their effects on both task mastery and general knowledge retention. Our
experiments reveal an optimal configuration that balances task-specific
performance with general knowledge retention. Based on our findings, we provide
empirically-grounded guidelines for selecting replay ratios based on
computational budget, enabling practitioners to achieve strong task adaptation
with significantly reduced training costs.

Abstract: Recent advances in open-source vision-language models (VLMs) offer new
opportunities for understanding complex and subjective multimodal phenomena
such as sarcasm. In this work, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art VLMs - BLIP2,
InstructBLIP, OpenFlamingo, LLaVA, PaliGemma, Gemma3, and Qwen-VL - on their
ability to detect multimodal sarcasm using zero-, one-, and few-shot prompting.
Furthermore, we evaluate the models' capabilities in generating explanations to
sarcastic instances. We evaluate the capabilities of VLMs on three benchmark
sarcasm datasets (Muse, MMSD2.0, and SarcNet). Our primary objectives are
twofold: (1) to quantify each model's performance in detecting sarcastic
image-caption pairs, and (2) to assess their ability to generate human-quality
explanations that highlight the visual-textual incongruities driving sarcasm.
Our results indicate that, while current models achieve moderate success in
binary sarcasm detection, they are still not able to generate high-quality
explanations without task-specific finetuning.

Motivation: 由于流程通常是资源驱动的，理解和纳入参与者行为对预测至关重要，但现有研究在将参与者行为作为时变信号纳入预测过程监控方面仍有限。

Method: 使用真实事件日志构建包含吞吐时间和参与者中心特征（参与者参与度、继续/中断/交接行为频率及其持续时间）的多变量时间序列，训练并比较多个模型。

Result: 参与者增强模型在RMSE、MAE和R2指标上持续优于仅包含吞吐时间特征的基线模型。

Conclusion: 将参与者行为随时间建模并纳入预测模型能够提升性能指标预测效果。

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) is a key task in Process Mining that aims
to predict future behavior, outcomes, or performance indicators. Accurate
prediction of the latter is critical for proactive decision-making. Given that
processes are often resource-driven, understanding and incorporating actor
behavior in forecasting is crucial. Although existing research has incorporated
aspects of actor behavior, its role as a time-varying signal in PPM remains
limited. This study investigates whether incorporating actor behavior
information, modeled as time series, can improve the predictive performance of
throughput time (TT) forecasting models. Using real-life event logs, we
construct multivariate time series that include TT alongside actor-centric
features, i.e., actor involvement, the frequency of continuation, interruption,
and handover behaviors, and the duration of these behaviors. We train and
compare several models to study the benefits of adding actor behavior. The
results show that actor-enriched models consistently outperform baseline
models, which only include TT features, in terms of RMSE, MAE, and R2. These
findings demonstrate that modeling actor behavior over time and incorporating
this information into forecasting models enhances performance indicator
predictions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种将显式负陈述整合到知识嵌入学习中的新方法，使用双模型架构分别训练正负陈述，通过相互评分生成负样本，在链接预测和三元组分类任务中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图嵌入方法大多依赖封闭世界假设，将缺失三元组视为假，这与现实世界知识图的开放世界假设不符。显式负陈述有助于区分假三元组和未知三元组，但很少被包含在知识图中且常被忽略。

Method: 采用双模型架构，两个嵌入模型并行训练：一个在正陈述上训练，另一个在负陈述上训练。训练时每个模型通过破坏正样本生成负样本，并选择另一个模型评分最高的候选作为负样本。

Result: 在通用和领域特定知识图上的广泛实验表明，该方法在链接预测和三元组分类任务中优于最先进的嵌入模型。

Conclusion: 将有意义负知识整合到嵌入学习中能提高预测性能，证明了显式负陈述在知识图嵌入中的价值。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs represent information as structured triples and serve as the
backbone for a wide range of applications, including question answering, link
prediction, and recommendation systems. A prominent line of research for
exploring knowledge graphs involves graph embedding methods, where entities and
relations are represented in low-dimensional vector spaces that capture
underlying semantics and structure. However, most existing methods rely on
assumptions such as the Closed World Assumption or Local Closed World
Assumption, treating missing triples as false. This contrasts with the Open
World Assumption underlying many real-world knowledge graphs. Furthermore,
while explicitly stated negative statements can help distinguish between false
and unknown triples, they are rarely included in knowledge graphs and are often
overlooked during embedding training.
  In this work, we introduce a novel approach that integrates explicitly
declared negative statements into the knowledge embedding learning process. Our
approach employs a dual-model architecture, where two embedding models are
trained in parallel, one on positive statements and the other on negative
statements. During training, each model generates negative samples by
corrupting positive samples and selecting the most likely candidates as scored
by the other model. The proposed approach is evaluated on both general-purpose
and domain-specific knowledge graphs, with a focus on link prediction and
triple classification tasks. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach improves predictive performance over state-of-the-art embedding
models, demonstrating the value of integrating meaningful negative knowledge
into embedding learning.

TL;DR: AdaRL是一个双层优化框架，通过自适应调整策略复杂度来提升强化学习的鲁棒性，避免了传统min-max优化的计算负担和保守性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统鲁棒强化学习方法依赖嵌套min-max优化，计算成本高且产生过于保守的策略，需要更高效的鲁棒性处理方法。

Method: 采用双层优化：下层在固定秩约束下优化策略，上层自适应调整秩以平衡偏差-方差权衡，将策略参数投影到低秩流形上。

Result: 在MuJoCo连续控制基准测试中，AdaRL不仅优于固定秩基线和最先进的鲁棒RL方法，还能收敛到任务的内在秩。

Conclusion: 自适应低秩策略表示为模型不确定性下的鲁棒强化学习提供了高效且原则性的替代方案。

Abstract: Robust reinforcement learning (Robust RL) seeks to handle epistemic
uncertainty in environment dynamics, but existing approaches often rely on
nested min--max optimization, which is computationally expensive and yields
overly conservative policies. We propose \textbf{Adaptive Rank Representation
(AdaRL)}, a bi-level optimization framework that improves robustness by
aligning policy complexity with the intrinsic dimension of the task. At the
lower level, AdaRL performs policy optimization under fixed-rank constraints
with dynamics sampled from a Wasserstein ball around a centroid model. At the
upper level, it adaptively adjusts the rank to balance the bias--variance
trade-off, projecting policy parameters onto a low-rank manifold. This design
avoids solving adversarial worst-case dynamics while ensuring robustness
without over-parameterization. Empirical results on MuJoCo continuous control
benchmarks demonstrate that AdaRL not only consistently outperforms fixed-rank
baselines (e.g., SAC) and state-of-the-art robust RL methods (e.g., RNAC,
Parseval), but also converges toward the intrinsic rank of the underlying
tasks. These results highlight that adaptive low-rank policy representations
provide an efficient and principled alternative for robust RL under model
uncertainty.

Conclusion: 发布了数据集和统一框架来支持用户事件建模的进一步研究，鼓励在该方向上的进展。

Abstract: User event modeling plays a central role in many machine learning
applications, with use cases spanning e-commerce, social media, finance,
cybersecurity, and other domains. User events can be broadly categorized into
personal events, which involve individual actions, and relational events, which
involve interactions between two users. These two types of events are typically
modeled separately, using sequence-based methods for personal events and
graph-based methods for relational events. Despite the need to capture both
event types in real-world systems, prior work has rarely considered them
together. This is often due to the convenient simplification that user behavior
can be adequately represented by a single formalization, either as a sequence
or a graph. To address this gap, there is a need for public datasets and
prediction tasks that explicitly incorporate both personal and relational
events. In this work, we introduce a collection of such datasets, propose a
unified formalization, and empirically show that models benefit from
incorporating both event types. Our results also indicate that current methods
leave a notable room for improvements. We release these resources to support
further research in unified user event modeling and encourage progress in this
direction.

Abstract: Dementia disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal
dementia (FTD) exhibit overlapping electrophysiological signatures in EEG that
challenge accurate diagnosis. Existing EEG-based methods are limited by
full-band frequency analysis that hinders precise differentiation of dementia
subtypes and severity stages. We propose a variational mixture of graph neural
experts (VMoGE) that integrates frequency-specific biomarker identification
with structured variational inference for enhanced dementia diagnosis and
staging. VMoGE employs a multi-granularity transformer to extract multi-scale
temporal patterns across four frequency bands, followed by a variational graph
convolutional encoder using Gaussian Markov Random Field priors. Through
structured variational inference and adaptive gating, VMoGE links neural
specialization to physiologically meaningful EEG frequency bands. Evaluated on
two diverse datasets for both subtype classification and severity staging,
VMoGE achieves superior performance with AUC improvements of +4% to +10% over
state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, VMoGE provides interpretable insights
through expert weights that correlate with clinical indicators and spatial
patterns aligned with neuropathological signatures, facilitating EEG biomarker
discovery for comprehensive dementia diagnosis and monitoring.

Motivation: 传统室内Wi-Fi定位方法对环境动态、信道传播特性和硬件异构性高度敏感，需要大量人工校准且性能易受设备、信道或部署条件变化影响。

Method: 通过在不同Wi-Fi数据集上微调LLM，Locaris学习从原始信号直接到设备位置的轻量级可泛化映射，将每个AP测量视为标记进行处理。

Conclusion: 紧凑型LLM可作为室内定位的无校准回归模型，在大规模部署中提供可扩展且稳健的跨环境性能，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Indoor Wi-Fi positioning remains a challenging problem due to the high
sensitivity of radio signals to environmental dynamics, channel propagation
characteristics, and hardware heterogeneity. Conventional fingerprinting and
model-based approaches typically require labor-intensive calibration and suffer
rapid performance degradation when devices, channel or deployment conditions
change. In this paper, we introduce Locaris, a decoder-only large language
model (LLM) for indoor localization. Locaris treats each access point (AP)
measurement as a token, enabling the ingestion of raw Wi-Fi telemetry without
pre-processing. By fine-tuning its LLM on different Wi-Fi datasets, Locaris
learns a lightweight and generalizable mapping from raw signals directly to
device location. Our experimental study comparing Locaris with state-of-the-art
methods consistently shows that Locaris matches or surpasses existing
techniques for various types of telemetry. Our results demonstrate that compact
LLMs can serve as calibration-free regression models for indoor localization,
offering scalable and robust cross-environment performance in heterogeneous
Wi-Fi deployments. Few-shot adaptation experiments, using only a handful of
calibration points per device, further show that Locaris maintains high
accuracy when applied to previously unseen devices and deployment scenarios.
This yields sub-meter accuracy with just a few hundred samples, robust
performance under missing APs and supports any and all available telemetry. Our
findings highlight the practical viability of Locaris for indoor positioning in
the real-world scenarios, particularly in large-scale deployments where
extensive calibration is infeasible.

Motivation: 解决Mao等人(2022)的RestartQ-UCB算法中存在的两个核心问题：完全遗忘（重启后丢失所有环境信息）和预定重启（不考虑策略与当前环境动态的不兼容性）。

Method: 引入了三种重启方法：部分重启、自适应重启和选择性重启，用于改进RestartQ-UCB和RANDOMIZEDQ算法。

Result: 在多个不同环境中实现了接近最优的实证性能，相对于RestartQ-UCB将动态遗憾降低了高达91%。

Conclusion: 提出的三种重启范式有效解决了非平稳强化学习中的重启设计问题，显著提升了算法性能。

Abstract: In this work, we propose three efficient restart paradigms for model-free
non-stationary reinforcement learning (RL). We identify two core issues with
the restart design of Mao et al. (2022)'s RestartQ-UCB algorithm: (1) complete
forgetting, where all the information learned about an environment is lost
after a restart, and (2) scheduled restarts, in which restarts occur only at
predefined timings, regardless of the incompatibility of the policy with the
current environment dynamics. We introduce three approaches, which we call
partial, adaptive, and selective restarts to modify the algorithms RestartQ-UCB
and RANDOMIZEDQ (Wang et al., 2025). We find near-optimal empirical performance
in multiple different environments, decreasing dynamic regret by up to $91$%
relative to RestartQ-UCB.

Abstract: We show that \emph{efficient Turing computability} at any fixed input/output
precision implies the existence of \emph{compositionally sparse}
(bounded-fan-in, polynomial-size) DAG representations and of corresponding
neural approximants achieving the target precision. Concretely: if
$f:[0,1]^d\to\R^m$ is computable in time polynomial in the bit-depths, then for
every pair of precisions $(n,m_{\mathrm{out}})$ there exists a bounded-fan-in
Boolean circuit of size and depth $\poly(n+m_{\mathrm{out}})$ computing the
discretized map; replacing each gate by a constant-size neural emulator yields
a deep network of size/depth $\poly(n+m_{\mathrm{out}})$ that achieves accuracy
$\varepsilon=2^{-m_{\mathrm{out}}}$. We also relate these constructions to
compositional approximation rates

TL;DR: 本文揭示了传统VAE中KL散度正则化器在强制潜在空间匹配因子化高斯先验方面的不可靠性，提出了基于最大均值差异(MMD)的可编程先验框架，能够显式塑造潜在空间，在复杂数据集上实现最先进的相互独立性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VAE框架使用KL散度惩罚来鼓励潜在空间匹配因子化高斯先验，但作者发现这种KL基正则化器是不可靠的机制，无法在聚合后验上强制执行目标分布。

Method: 提出了可编程先验框架，该方法基于最大均值差异(MMD)，允许实践者显式地塑造潜在空间。同时引入了无监督的潜在可预测性评分(LPS)来量化解缠效果。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和Tiny ImageNet等复杂数据集上实现了最先进的相互独立性，且没有常见的重建权衡问题。该框架还能构建复杂先验以改善与语义特征的对应关系。

Conclusion: 这项工作为表示工程提供了基础工具，为模型可识别性和因果推理开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Learning disentangled representations, where distinct factors of variation
are captured by independent latent variables, is a central goal in machine
learning. The dominant approach has been the Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
framework, which uses a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence penalty to encourage
the latent space to match a factorized Gaussian prior. In this work, however,
we provide direct evidence that this KL-based regularizer is an unreliable
mechanism, consistently failing to enforce the target distribution on the
aggregate posterior. We validate this and quantify the resulting entanglement
using our novel, unsupervised Latent Predictability Score (LPS). To address
this failure, we introduce the Programmable Prior Framework, a method built on
the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). Our framework allows practitioners to
explicitly sculpt the latent space, achieving state-of-the-art mutual
independence on complex datasets like CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet without the
common reconstruction trade-off. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this
programmability can be used to engineer sophisticated priors that improve
alignment with semantically meaningful features. Ultimately, our work provides
a foundational tool for representation engineering, opening new avenues for
model identifiability and causal reasoning.

TL;DR: 该论文提出Y形生成流，通过共享路径移动概率质量，然后分支到特定端点，优于传统的V形传输方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代连续时间生成模型通常采用V形传输，即每个样本沿着近乎直线的轨迹从先验分布移动到数据分布，忽略了共享结构。

Method: 引入基于新型速度驱动传输成本的Y形生成流，具有亚线性指数（0到1之间），通过可扩展的神经ODE训练目标实现。

Result: 在合成、图像和生物学数据集上，Y流能够恢复层次感知结构，在分布指标上优于强流基线方法，并以更少的积分步骤达到目标。

Conclusion: Y形生成流通过共享路径和分支结构，有效利用了数据中的共享结构，提高了生成效率和质量。

Abstract: Modern continuous-time generative models often induce V-shaped transport:
each sample travels independently along nearly straight trajectories from prior
to data, overlooking shared structure. We introduce Y-shaped generative flows,
which move probability mass together along shared pathways before branching to
target-specific endpoints. Our formulation is based on novel velocity-powered
transport cost with a sublinear exponent (between zero and one). this concave
dependence rewards joint and fast mass movement. Practically, we instantiate
the idea in a scalable neural ODE training objective. On synthetic, image, and
biology datasets, Y-flows recover hierarchy-aware structure, improve
distributional metrics over strong flow-based baselines, and reach targets with
fewer integration steps.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MosaicDiff是一个新颖的扩散模型加速框架，通过轨迹感知的结构剪枝将扩散预训练动态与后训练采样加速对齐，实现高效加速而不损失输出质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的预训练过程存在明显的学习速度阶段差异，但之前的后训练加速方法完全忽视了这一特性。

Method: 采用轨迹感知的结构剪枝方法，根据预训练不同阶段的学习速度自适应调整剪枝策略：中间快速学习阶段采用保守剪枝，早期和后期慢速学习阶段采用激进剪枝。

Result: 在DiT和SDXL上的大量实验表明，该方法在采样速度上实现显著提升，且不损害输出质量，大幅超越之前的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为无训练扩散加速提供了新的视角，通过协调模型内部训练动态与加速采样过程，实现了更高效和鲁棒的加速。

Abstract: Diffusion models are renowned for their generative capabilities, yet their
pretraining processes exhibit distinct phases of learning speed that have been
entirely overlooked in prior post-training acceleration efforts in the
community. In this study, we introduce a novel framework called MosaicDiff that
aligns diffusion pretraining dynamics with post-training sampling acceleration
via trajectory-aware structural pruning. Our approach leverages the observation
that the middle, fast-learning stage of diffusion pretraining requires more
conservative pruning to preserve critical model features, while the early and
later, slow-learning stages benefit from a more aggressive pruning strategy.
This adaptive pruning mechanism is the first to explicitly mirror the inherent
learning speed variations of diffusion pretraining, thereby harmonizing the
model's inner training dynamics with its accelerated sampling process.
Extensive experiments on DiT and SDXL demonstrate that our method achieves
significant speed-ups in sampling without compromising output quality,
outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods by large margins, also
providing a new viewpoint for more efficient and robust training-free diffusion
acceleration.

Motivation: 当前Transformer理解方法缺乏数学框架来机制性地建模各层如何促进状态转换，受物理学跨学科视角启发，利用语言模型固有的概率性与量子力学核心假设的相似性。

Method: 将Transformer隐层激活转换为希尔伯特空间状态向量，将隐藏层重新表述为幺正算子和哈密顿量，在推理过程中演化状态，最后应用玻恩规则和特定测量算子获得最终概率分布。

Result: 通过玩具Transformer的概念验证，展示了QLENS在探究模型预测轨迹中各层影响的潜力。

Conclusion: QLENS为跨领域洞察提供了基础，有助于更广泛地理解Transformer模型。

Abstract: In natural language processing, current methods for understanding
Transformers are successful at identifying intermediate predictions during a
model's inference. However, these approaches function as limited diagnostic
checkpoints, lacking a mathematical framework for mechanistically modeling how
each layer facilitates transitions between these evolving states. This
interpretability gap and past successes of interdisciplinary outlooks inspire
us to turn to physics in search of a descriptive mathematical framework for
Transformers. We observe that language models are intrinsically probabilistic,
an attribute that is echoed in the core postulates of quantum mechanics. This
parallel inspires us to translate insights from this discipline to that of
natural language processing. Towards this objective, we propose QLENS a novel
attempt to develop a physics-based perspective on the Transformer generation
process. Under QLENS, a Transformer is studied by converting its latent
activations into a state vector in a Hilbert space derived from the model's
output units. This state subsequently evolves through hidden layers -
reformulated as unitary operators and analogously defined Hamiltonians - during
inference. The model's final probability distribution is obtained by applying
the Born rule to the end state using a specific measurement operator. To
demonstrate QLENS's potential, we conduct a proof-of-concept by probing a toy
Transformer to investigate the influence of individual layers in a model's
prediction trajectory. We present our work as a foundation for cross-domain
insights to be leveraged towards a broader understanding of Transformers.

TL;DR: CW-DPO是一种两阶段的视觉语言模型对齐方法，通过温和负样本监督和冷却权重机制，稳定训练过程并提高性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于偏好的视觉语言模型微调方法存在训练不稳定问题，错误的负样本会产生无信息梯度破坏训练

Method: 第一阶段使用温和负样本进行监督微调，第二阶段在DPO目标中引入基于平均token对数概率的冷却权重来抑制无信息梯度

Result: CW-DPO在多种VLM任务中实现了更稳定的优化、更好的校准、更高的配对胜率，且收敛步数更少

Conclusion: 在冷却偏好之前平滑学习动态是稳健VLM对齐的简单通用原则

Abstract: Preference-based finetuning of vision--language models (VLMs) is brittle:
trivially wrong negatives inject uninformative gradients that destabilize
training. We recast alignment as \textbf{learning-dynamics--aware optimization}
and introduce \textbf{Cooling-Weighted DPO (CW-DPO)}, a two-stage recipe that
explicitly models and exploits the training trajectory. \textbf{Stage 1}
performs supervised finetuning with \textbf{gentle negatives}:
\textbf{low-weight smoothed supervision} that regularizes the base policy and
curbs overconfidence without explicit penalties. \textbf{Stage 2} applies a DPO
objective in which the \textbf{negative term is scaled by a cooling weight}
computed from the model's \textbf{average token log-probability} on each
negative, suppressing uninformative gradients from easy or off-distribution
samples while preserving signal from hard negatives. In practice, we emphasize
\textbf{on-policy negatives} and allow \textbf{mixed negatives} by blending a
controllable fraction of dataset negatives to maintain contrast freshness.
Throughout, we instrument training with $\Delta\!\log p$ probes on positives
and negatives as first-class signals for early stopping, curriculum design, and
failure diagnosis. Across diverse VLM tasks, CW-DPO yields \textbf{more stable
optimization}, \textbf{better calibration}, and \textbf{higher pairwise
win-rates} than SFT-only and vanilla DPO, while \textbf{converging in fewer
steps}. Ablations isolate the \textbf{cooling-weight mechanism} as the primary
driver of these gains and show complementary benefits from mixing on-policy and
dataset negatives. Taken together, our results show that \textbf{smoothing
learning dynamics before cooling preferences} is a simple, general principle
for robust VLM alignment.

Conclusion: 揭示了神经动力学中相变与学习性能的强关联，为生物可信学习算法提供了理论基础和实现方案。

Abstract: Despite the striking successes of deep neural networks trained with
gradient-based optimization, these methods differ fundamentally from their
biological counterparts. This gap raises key questions about how nature
achieves robust, sample-efficient learning at minimal energy costs and solves
the credit-assignment problem without backpropagation. We take a step toward
bridging contemporary AI and computational neuroscience by studying how neural
dynamics can support fully local, distributed learning that scales to simple
machine-learning benchmarks. Using tools from statistical mechanics, we
identify conditions for the emergence of robust dynamical attractors in random
asymmetric recurrent networks. We derive a closed-form expression for the
number of fixed points as a function of self-coupling strength, and we reveal a
phase transition in their structure: below a critical self-coupling, isolated
fixed points coexist with exponentially many narrow clusters showing the
overlap-gap property; above it, subdominant yet dense and extensive clusters
appear. These fixed points become accessible, including to a simple
asynchronous dynamical rule, after an algorithm-dependent self-coupling
threshold. Building on this analysis, we propose a biologically plausible
algorithm for supervised learning with any binary recurrent network. Inputs are
mapped to fixed points of the dynamics, by relaxing under transient external
stimuli and stabilizing the resulting configurations via local plasticity. We
show that our algorithm can learn an entangled version of MNIST, leverages
depth to develop hierarchical representations and increase hetero-association
capacity, and is applicable to several architectures. Finally, we highlight the
strong connection between algorithm performance and the unveiled phase
transition, and we suggest a cortex-inspired alternative to self-couplings for
its emergence.

Method: 通过实验分析使用精确曲率信息（真实Hessian矩阵）与近似曲率信息（拟牛顿法）在神经网络训练中的表现。

Result: 使用精确曲率信息时神经网络训练可靠地失败，而拟牛顿法等近似方法反而能成功训练，这表明损失函数几何结构比传统认知更复杂。

Conclusion: 精确二阶优化方法在神经网络训练中失效的现象揭示了非线性离散化的几何特性，并质疑了损失函数充满局部最小值的传统观点。

Abstract: Second-order methods are emerging as promising alternatives to standard
first-order optimizers such as gradient descent and ADAM for training neural
networks. Though the advantages of including curvature information in computing
optimization steps have been celebrated in the scientific machine learning
literature, the only second-order methods that have been studied are
quasi-Newton, meaning that the Hessian matrix of the objective function is
approximated. Though one would expect only to gain from using the true Hessian
in place of its approximation, we show that neural network training reliably
fails when relying on exact curvature information. The failure modes provide
insight both into the geometry of nonlinear discretizations as well as the
distribution of stationary points in the loss landscape, leading us to question
the conventional wisdom that the loss landscape is replete with local minima.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba作为线性时间序列模型表现出优异的计算效率和实证性能，但其底层机制的理论理解仍然有限，需要对其上下文学习能力进行严谨的理论分析。

Method: 研究Mamba在单索引模型y≈g*(⟨β,x⟩)上的上下文学习，通过梯度预训练方法分析其测试时特征学习能力，提取相关方向β。

Result: 证明Mamba能够实现高效的上下文学习，其测试时样本复杂度优于线性Transformer（表现为核方法），与非线性Transformer相当，突破了CSQ下界并接近信息理论最优速率。

Conclusion: Mamba的非线性门控机制在特征提取中起关键作用，是其实现计算效率和高性能的根本驱动力。

Abstract: Mamba, a recently proposed linear-time sequence model, has attracted
significant attention for its computational efficiency and strong empirical
performance. However, a rigorous theoretical understanding of its underlying
mechanisms remains limited. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of
Mamba's in-context learning (ICL) capability by focusing on tasks defined by
low-dimensional nonlinear target functions. Specifically, we study in-context
learning of a single-index model $y \approx g_*(\langle \boldsymbol{\beta},
\boldsymbol{x} \rangle)$, which depends on only a single relevant direction
$\boldsymbol{\beta}$, referred to as feature. We prove that Mamba, pretrained
by gradient-based methods, can achieve efficient ICL via test-time feature
learning, extracting the relevant direction directly from context examples.
Consequently, we establish a test-time sample complexity that improves upon
linear Transformers -- analyzed to behave like kernel methods -- and is
comparable to nonlinear Transformers, which have been shown to surpass the
Correlational Statistical Query (CSQ) lower bound and achieve near
information-theoretically optimal rate in previous works. Our analysis reveals
the crucial role of the nonlinear gating mechanism in Mamba for feature
extraction, highlighting it as the fundamental driver behind Mamba's ability to
achieve both computational efficiency and high performance.

Abstract: Generative classifiers, which leverage conditional generative models for
classification, have recently demonstrated desirable properties such as
robustness to distribution shifts. However, recent progress in this area has
been largely driven by diffusion-based models, whose substantial computational
cost severely limits scalability. This exclusive focus on diffusion-based
methods has also constrained our understanding of generative classifiers. In
this work, we propose a novel generative classifier built on recent advances in
visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling, which offers a new perspective for
studying generative classifiers. To further enhance its performance, we
introduce the Adaptive VAR Classifier$^+$ (A-VARC$^+$), which achieves a
superior trade-off between accuracy and inference speed, thereby significantly
improving practical applicability. Moreover, we show that the VAR-based method
exhibits fundamentally different properties from diffusion-based methods. In
particular, due to its tractable likelihood, the VAR-based classifier enables
visual explainability via token-wise mutual information and demonstrates
inherent resistance to catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental learning
tasks.

Abstract: Deep learning-based automatic sleep staging has significantly advanced in
performance and plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of sleep disorders.
However, those models often struggle to generalize on unseen subjects due to
variability in physiological signals, resulting in degraded performance in
out-of-distribution scenarios. To address this issue, domain generalization
approaches have recently been studied to ensure generalized performance on
unseen domains during training. Among those techniques, contrastive learning
has proven its validity in learning domain-invariant features by aligning
samples of the same class across different domains. Despite its potential, many
existing methods are insufficient to extract adequately domain-invariant
representations, as they do not explicitly address domain characteristics
embedded within the unshared information across samples. In this paper, we
posit that mitigating such domain-relevant attributes-referred to as excess
domain-relevant information-is key to bridging the domain gap. However, the
direct strategy to mitigate the domain-relevant attributes often overfits
features at the high-level information, limiting their ability to leverage the
diverse temporal and spectral information encoded in the multiple feature
levels. To address these limitations, we propose a novel MEASURE (Multi-scalE
minimAl SUfficient Representation lEarning) framework, which effectively
reduces domain-relevant information while preserving essential temporal and
spectral features for sleep stage classification. In our exhaustive experiments
on publicly available sleep staging benchmark datasets, SleepEDF-20 and MASS,
our proposed method consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods. Our

Method: 基于奇异学习理论构建分阶段数据归因框架，通过玩具模型进行理论和实证验证，并在语言模型中大规模展示这些现象。

Result: 研究发现影响关系会发生非单调变化，包括符号翻转和在发展转变时的急剧峰值，这些动态变化与模型学习语义层次结构的进程直接对应。

Conclusion: 神经网络学习过程中的样本影响是动态变化的，这种变化模式与模型的发展阶段相吻合，为理解深度学习训练动态提供了新视角。

Abstract: Current training data attribution (TDA) methods treat the influence one
sample has on another as static, but neural networks learn in distinct stages
that exhibit changing patterns of influence. In this work, we introduce a
framework for stagewise data attribution grounded in singular learning theory.
We predict that influence can change non-monotonically, including sign flips
and sharp peaks at developmental transitions. We first validate these
predictions analytically and empirically in a toy model, showing that dynamic
shifts in influence directly map to the model's progressive learning of a
semantic hierarchy. Finally, we demonstrate these phenomena at scale in
language models, where token-level influence changes align with known
developmental stages.

Conclusion: 模块特定训练策略能够有效利用架构改进的效益，为深度强化学习的可扩展性提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Scaling neural networks has driven breakthrough advances in machine learning,
yet this paradigm fails in deep reinforcement learning (DRL), where larger
models often degrade performance due to unique optimization pathologies such as
plasticity loss. While recent works show that dynamically adapting network
topology during training can mitigate these issues, existing studies have three
critical limitations: (1) applying uniform dynamic training strategies across
all modules despite encoder, critic, and actor following distinct learning
paradigms, (2) focusing evaluation on basic architectures without clarifying
the relative importance and interaction between dynamic training and
architectural improvements, and (3) lacking systematic comparison between
different dynamic approaches including sparse-to-sparse, dense-to-sparse, and
sparse-to-dense. Through comprehensive investigation across modules and
architectures, we reveal that dynamic sparse training strategies provide
module-specific benefits that complement the primary scalability foundation
established by architectural improvements. We finally distill these insights
into Module-Specific Training (MST), a practical framework that further
exploits the benefits of architectural improvements and demonstrates
substantial scalability gains across diverse RL algorithms without algorithmic
modifications.

TL;DR: Chimera是一个统一模型，通过状态空间模型直接融入数据拓扑结构，无需领域特定的偏置，在语言、视觉和图数据上均表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Transformer方法依赖自注意力机制，将数据视为无序集合，忽略了数据的邻域结构或图拓扑，需要设计任务特定的偏置（如位置嵌入、随机游走）来融入拓扑结构，但这些设计需要大量工作且可能引入副作用。

Method: 提出Chimera模型，将状态空间模型推广到捕获任意图拓扑，无需位置嵌入。针对有向无环图可实现线性时间递归实现，对一般图通过数学松弛达到Transformer的二次复杂度。

Result: 在GLUE上比BERT高0.7分，在ImageNet-1k上比ViT高2.6%，在Long Range Graph Benchmark上优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: 数据拓扑是跨模态的强大归纳偏置，Chimera验证了这一核心贡献。

Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning methods have become the standard approach for
modeling diverse data such as sequences, images, and graphs. These methods rely
on self-attention, which treats data as an unordered set of elements. This
ignores the neighborhood structure or graph topology of the data and requires
inductive biases--such as position embeddings in sequences and images, or
random walks in graphs--to incorporate topology. However, designing such
task-specific biases requires significant effort and can introduce side effects
that hinder generalization. We introduce Chimera, a unified model that directly
incorporates data topology in a principled way, removing the need for
domain-specific biases. The key idea is that state space models--which
naturally do not require position embeddings--can be generalized to capture any
graph topology. Our experiments show that Chimera achieves strong performance
across language, vision, and graph domains, outperforming BERT on GLUE by 0.7
points, ViT on ImageNet-1k by 2.6%, and all baselines on the Long Range Graph
Benchmark. We further propose algorithmic optimizations to improve Chimera's
efficiency: (1) for Directed Acyclic Graphs, Chimera can be implemented as a
linear-time recurrence; (2) for general graphs, a simple mathematical
relaxation achieves Transformer's quadratic complexity without domain-specific
heuristics. These results validate Chimera's core contribution and support the
idea that data topology is a powerful inductive bias across modalities.

Conclusion: nuGPR框架通过数值线性代数技术的集成应用，有效解决了GPR的高计算成本问题，为大规模高斯过程回归提供了高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is an important type of supervised machine
learning model with inherent uncertainty measure in its predictions. We propose
a new framework, nuGPR, to address the well-known challenge of high computation
cost associated with GPR training. Our framework includes several ideas from
numerical linear algebra to reduce the amount of computation in key steps of
GPR, and we combine them to establish an end-to-end training algorithm.
Specifically, we leverage the preconditioned conjugate gradient method to
accelerate the convergence of the linear solves required in GPR. We exploit
clustering in the input data to identify block-diagonal structure of the
covariance matrix and subsequently construct low-rank approximations of the
off-diagonal blocks. These enhancements significantly reduce the time and space
complexity of our computations. In addition, unlike other frameworks that rely
on exact differentiation, we employ numerical gradients to optimize the
hyperparameters of our GPR model, further reducing the training cost by
eliminating the need for backpropagation. Lastly, we leverage the CUDA Toolkit
to efficiently parallelize the training procedure on NVIDIA GPUs. As a result,
nuGPR reduces total training time by up to 2x and peak memory consumption by up
to 12x on various synthetic and real-world datasets when compared to the best
existing GPU-based GPR implementation.

TL;DR: 提出GRACE框架，通过自适应频谱专家和跨集分布校准技术解决图小样本学习中的局部拓扑结构异质性和支持集-查询集分布差异问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图小样本学习方法存在两个关键局限：1) 使用预定义的统一图滤波器无法处理真实图中局部拓扑结构的异质性；2) 假设支持集和查询集来自相同分布，但在小样本条件下有限标注数据可能无法充分捕捉查询集的复杂分布。

Method: GRACE框架整合了自适应频谱专家（Adaptive spectrum experts）和跨集分布校准（Cross-set distribution calibration）技术，理论上有助于适应局部结构变化和跨集分布校准。

Result: 在广泛的实验设置中，GRACE始终优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: GRACE通过同时适应局部结构变化和进行跨集分布校准，有效提升了图小样本学习模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Graph few-shot learning has attracted increasing attention due to its ability
to rapidly adapt models to new tasks with only limited labeled nodes. Despite
the remarkable progress made by existing graph few-shot learning methods,
several key limitations remain. First, most current approaches rely on
predefined and unified graph filters (e.g., low-pass or high-pass filters) to
globally enhance or suppress node frequency signals. Such fixed spectral
operations fail to account for the heterogeneity of local topological
structures inherent in real-world graphs. Moreover, these methods often assume
that the support and query sets are drawn from the same distribution. However,
under few-shot conditions, the limited labeled data in the support set may not
sufficiently capture the complex distribution of the query set, leading to
suboptimal generalization. To address these challenges, we propose GRACE, a
novel Graph few-shot leaRning framework that integrates Adaptive spectrum
experts with Cross-sEt distribution calibration techniques. Theoretically, the
proposed approach enhances model generalization by adapting to both local
structural variations and cross-set distribution calibration. Empirically,
GRACE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across a wide range
of experimental settings. Our code can be found here.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种针对联邦学习的故意公平性攻击，恶意客户端通过增加公平性损失来发送有偏见的模型，即使数据分布均匀也能传播偏见，且难以检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习虽然保护隐私，但容易受到投毒攻击，且可能传播偏见。现有研究主要关注准确性攻击，而公平性攻击的研究较少。

Method: 提出一种故意公平性攻击方法，恶意客户端在训练时通过优化公平性指标（如人口统计均等、均等化几率）来增加公平性损失，同时保持全局准确性。

Result: 实验表明，即使在只有一个恶意客户端的情况下，攻击也能将偏见增加高达90%，且能绕过现有的拜占庭鲁棒和公平感知聚合方案。

Conclusion: 该攻击揭示了联邦学习系统在公平性方面的脆弱性，需要开发新的防御机制来对抗此类隐蔽的公平性攻击。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving machine learning technique
that facilitates collaboration among participants across demographics. FL
enables model sharing, while restricting the movement of data. Since FL
provides participants with independence over their training data, it becomes
susceptible to poisoning attacks. Such collaboration also propagates bias among
the participants, even unintentionally, due to different data distribution or
historical bias present in the data. This paper proposes an intentional
fairness attack, where a client maliciously sends a biased model, by increasing
the fairness loss while training, even considering homogeneous data
distribution. The fairness loss is calculated by solving an optimization
problem for fairness metrics such as demographic parity and equalized odds. The
attack is insidious and hard to detect, as it maintains global accuracy even
after increasing the bias. We evaluate our attack against the state-of-the-art
Byzantine-robust and fairness-aware aggregation schemes over different
datasets, in various settings. The empirical results demonstrate the attack
efficacy by increasing the bias up to 90\%, even in the presence of a single
malicious client in the FL system.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了在生存数据集中进行预算学习的方法，允许学习者在预算限制下支付费用来获取部分标记的删失实例，从而提高模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在生存数据集中，存在大量删失实例（仅知道事件发生时间的下界），传统监督学习无法充分利用这些信息。预算学习可以模拟现实世界数据收集过程，通过支付费用获取更多标记信息来改进模型。

Method: 提出了将最先进的预算学习算法应用于生存数据的方法，允许学习者支付费用来（部分）标记删失实例，例如从(3年，删失)更新为(7.2年，未删失)或其他变体。

Result: 实验和理论分析表明，该方法在多个生存任务基准上优于其他潜在方法，且其边界和时间复杂度与标准主动学习方法BatchBALD渐近等价。

Conclusion: 该方法为生存数据集中的预算学习提供了有效的解决方案，能够在不完全信息条件下优化模型性能，具有重要的理论和实践意义。

Abstract: Standard supervised learners attempt to learn a model from a labeled dataset.
Given a small set of labeled instances, and a pool of unlabeled instances, a
budgeted learner can use its given budget to pay to acquire the labels of some
unlabeled instances, which it can then use to produce a model. Here, we explore
budgeted learning in the context of survival datasets, which include (right)
censored instances, where we know only a lower bound on an instance's
time-to-event. Here, that learner can pay to (partially) label a censored
instance -- e.g., to acquire the actual time for an instance [perhaps go from
(3 yr, censored) to (7.2 yr, uncensored)], or other variants [e.g., learn about
one more year, so go from (3 yr, censored) to either (4 yr, censored) or
perhaps (3.2 yr, uncensored)]. This serves as a model of real world data
collection, where follow-up with censored patients does not always lead to
uncensoring, and how much information is given to the learner model during data
collection is a function of the budget and the nature of the data itself. We
provide both experimental and theoretical results for how to apply
state-of-the-art budgeted learning algorithms to survival data and the
respective limitations that exist in doing so. Our approach provides bounds and
time complexity asymptotically equivalent to the standard active learning
method BatchBALD. Moreover, empirical analysis on several survival tasks show
that our model performs better than other potential approaches on several
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型常在推理链中进行自我验证，但研究发现LLM在推理链中检测错误的能力有限，因此反思如何带来实际改进仍不清楚。

Method: 构建最小化推理框架，支持小型transformer进行无自然语言的自验证反思，确保分析清晰性并降低实验成本。

Result: 实验证明仅几百万参数的小型transformer在训练和反思执行中都从自验证中受益，在整数乘法和数独任务中达到显著性能；强化学习主要优化浅层统计模式而非真正减少验证误差。

Conclusion: 将生成式transformer与判别式验证相结合，本质上促进了推理链推理，无论模型规模和是否使用自然语言。

Abstract: Advanced large language models (LLMs) frequently reflect in reasoning
chain-of-thoughts (CoTs), where they self-verify the correctness of current
solutions and explore alternatives. However, given recent findings that LLMs
detect limited errors in CoTs, how reflection contributes to empirical
improvements remains unclear. To analyze this issue, in this paper, we present
a minimalistic reasoning framework to support basic self-verifying reflection
for small transformers without natural language, which ensures analytic clarity
and reduces the cost of comprehensive experiments. Theoretically, we prove that
self-verifying reflection guarantees improvements if verification errors are
properly bounded. Experimentally, we show that tiny transformers, with only a
few million parameters, benefit from self-verification in both training and
reflective execution, reaching remarkable LLM-level performance in integer
multiplication and Sudoku. Similar to LLM results, we find that reinforcement
learning (RL) improves in-distribution performance and incentivizes frequent
reflection for tiny transformers, yet RL mainly optimizes shallow statistical
patterns without faithfully reducing verification errors. In conclusion,
integrating generative transformers with discriminative verification inherently
facilitates CoT reasoning, regardless of scaling and natural language.

<details>

Motivation: 元学习样本重加权方法虽然能利用少量干净数据指导训练，但其行为和训练动态缺乏理论理解，需要深入分析其工作机制。

Method: 通过理论分析元重加权的训练轨迹，提出包含均值中心化、行偏移和标签符号调制的轻量级替代方法，避免昂贵的双层优化。

Result: 在合成和真实标签噪声基准测试中，该方法持续优于强重加权/选择基线方法。

Conclusion: 元重加权的训练动态可分为三个不同阶段，基于此分析提出的轻量级替代方法在性能稳定性和计算效率方面表现优异。

Abstract: Learning with noisy labels remains challenging because over-parameterized
networks memorize corrupted supervision. Meta-learning-based sample reweighting
mitigates this by using a small clean subset to guide training, yet its
behavior and training dynamics lack theoretical understanding. We provide a
rigorous theoretical analysis of meta-reweighting under label noise and show
that its training trajectory unfolds in three phases: (i) an alignment phase
that amplifies examples consistent with a clean subset and suppresses
conflicting ones; (ii) a filtering phase driving noisy example weights toward
zero until the clean subset loss plateaus; and (iii) a post-filtering phase in
which noise filtration becomes perturbation-sensitive. The mechanism is a
similarity-weighted coupling between training and clean subset signals together
with clean subset training loss contraction; in the post-filtering regime where
the clean-subset loss is sufficiently small, the coupling term vanishes and
meta-reweighting loses discriminatory power. Guided by this analysis, we
propose a lightweight surrogate for meta-reweighting that integrates
mean-centering, row shifting, and label-signed modulation, yielding more stable
performance while avoiding expensive bi-level optimization. Across synthetic
and real noisy-label benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms strong
reweighting/selection baselines.

Conclusion: DE3S方法通过创新的双增强软形状学习框架，有效解决了医疗早期时间序列分类中的准确性和早期性冲突问题，在真实医疗场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Early time-series classification (ETSC) in medical applications is crucial
for time-sensitive scenarios such as sepsis prediction in intensive care units
(ICUs), where a large number of deaths are caused by delayed prediction. ETSC
can significantly improve ICU resource utilization efficiency and healthcare
precision. However, it faces conflicting goals of accuracy and earliness, with
existing methods often trading one for the other, struggling to capture subtle
early-stage patterns due to weak initial signals and class imbalance. The key
to solve these challenges is to find shapelets, which are discriminative
subsequences (or shapes) with high interpretability in time-series
classification. This paper proposes Dual-Enhanced Soft-Sparse-Shape Learning
for Medical Early Time-Series Classification (DE3S), which introduces a novel
Dual-Enhanced Soft-Shape Learning framework to figure out shapelets precisely
through three innovations: (1) a comprehensive dual-enhancement strategy
combines traditional temporal augmentation with attention-based global temporal
enhancement for robust representation learning, (2) an attention-score-based
soft shapelet sparsification mechanism dynamically preserves discriminative
patterns while aggregating less important shapelets into representative tokens,
and (3) a dual-path Mixture of Experts Network (MoE) and Inception modules
fusion architecture where MoE performs local learning within shapelets and
multi-scale Inception modules capture global patterns across shapelets. The
framework employs weighted cross-entropy loss for class imbalance handling and
demonstrates robustness on subject-consistency datasets. Extensive experiments
on six real-world medical datasets show state-of-the-art performance, with
ablation studies confirming component efficacy.

Conclusion: 该框架弥合了扩散模型中快速采样和可解释性之间的差距，为可解释图像合成铺平了道路。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive success in high-fidelity image
generation but suffer from slow sampling due to their inherently iterative
denoising process. While recent one-step methods accelerate inference by
learning direct noise-to-image mappings, they sacrifice the interpretability
and fine-grained control intrinsic to diffusion dynamics, key advantages that
enable applications like editable generation. To resolve this dichotomy, we
introduce \textbf{Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion}, a novel framework that
achieves both one-step sampling and interpretable generative trajectories.
Grounded in Koopman operator theory, our method lifts the nonlinear diffusion
dynamics into a latent space where evolution is governed by globally linear
operators, enabling closed-form trajectory solutions. This formulation not only
eliminates iterative sampling but also provides full access to intermediate
states, allowing manual intervention during generation. To model the
multi-scale nature of images, we design a hierarchical architecture that
disentangles generative dynamics across spatial resolutions via scale-specific
Koopman subspaces, capturing coarse-to-fine details systematically. We
empirically show that the Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion not only achieves
competitive one-step generation performance but also provides a principled
mechanism for interpreting and manipulating the generative process through
spectral analysis. Our framework bridges the gap between fast sampling and
interpretability in diffusion models, paving the way for explainable image
synthesis in generative modeling.

Conclusion: 揭示了Graph-LLMs中先前未被充分探索的语义维度脆弱性，为提升模型韧性提供了重要见解

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a pivotal framework for modeling
graph-structured data, enabling a wide range of applications from social
network analysis to molecular chemistry. By integrating large language models
(LLMs), text-attributed graphs (TAGs) enhance node representations with rich
textual semantics, significantly boosting the expressive power of graph-based
learning. However, this sophisticated synergy introduces critical
vulnerabilities, as Graph-LLMs are susceptible to adversarial attacks on both
their structural topology and textual attributes. Although specialized attack
methods have been designed for each of these aspects, no work has yet unified
them into a comprehensive approach. In this work, we propose the Interpretable
Multi-Dimensional Graph Attack (IMDGA), a novel human-centric adversarial
attack framework designed to orchestrate multi-level perturbations across both
graph structure and textual features. IMDGA utilizes three tightly integrated
modules to craft attacks that balance interpretability and impact, enabling a
deeper understanding of Graph-LLM vulnerabilities. Through rigorous theoretical
analysis and comprehensive empirical evaluations on diverse datasets and
architectures, IMDGA demonstrates superior interpretability, attack
effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness compared to existing methods. By
exposing critical weaknesses in TAG representation learning, this work uncovers
a previously underexplored semantic dimension of vulnerability in Graph-LLMs,
offering valuable insights for improving their resilience. Our code and
resources are publicly available at

Conclusion: MoRA通过实例特定的动态适应方法，有效解决了分子图结构与LLM整合的挑战，在保持LLM通用能力的同时提升了分子任务的性能。

Abstract: Effectively integrating molecular graph structures with Large Language Models
(LLMs) is a key challenge in drug discovery. Most existing multi-modal
alignment methods typically process these structures by fine-tuning the LLM or
adding a static adapter simultaneously. However, these approaches have two main
limitations: (1) it optimizes a shared parameter space across all molecular
inputs, limiting the model's ability to capture instance-specific structural
features; and (2) fine-tuning the LLM for molecular tasks can lead to
catastrophic forgetting, undermining its general reasoning capabilities. In
this paper, instead of static task-oriented adaptation, we propose an
instance-specific parameter space alignment approach for each molecule
on-the-fly. To this end, we introduce Molecule-aware Low-Rank Adaptation (MoRA)
that produces a unique set of low-rank adaptation weights for each input
molecular graph. These weights are then dynamically injected into a frozen LLM,
allowing the model to adapt its reasoning to the structure of each molecular
input, while preserving the LLM's core knowledge. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that on key molecular tasks, such as chemical reaction prediction
and molecular captioning, MoRA's instance-specific dynamic adaptation
outperforms statically adapted baselines, including a 14.1% relative
improvement in reaction prediction exact match and a 22% reduction in error for
quantum property prediction. The code is available at

Conclusion: 正则化能有效应对表现性效应，特别是在过参数化情况下，最优正则化参数可根据表现性效应强度预先设定。

Abstract: In performative learning, the data distribution reacts to the deployed model
- for example, because strategic users adapt their features to game it - which
creates a more complex dynamic than in classical supervised learning. One
should thus not only optimize the model for the current data but also take into
account that the model might steer the distribution in a new direction, without
knowing the exact nature of the potential shift. We explore how regularization
can help cope with performative effects by studying its impact in
high-dimensional ridge regression. We show that, while performative effects
worsen the test risk in the population setting, they can be beneficial in the
over-parameterized regime where the number of features exceeds the number of
samples. We show that the optimal regularization scales with the overall
strength of the performative effect, making it possible to set the
regularization in anticipation of this effect. We illustrate this finding
through empirical evaluations of the optimal regularization parameter on both
synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs), as a leading class of generative models, offer key
advantages for reinforcement learning (RL), including multi-modal
expressiveness, stable training, and trajectory-level planning. This survey
delivers a comprehensive and up-to-date synthesis of diffusion-based RL. We
first provide an overview of RL, highlighting its challenges, and then
introduce the fundamental concepts of DMs, investigating how they are
integrated into RL frameworks to address key challenges in this research field.
We establish a dual-axis taxonomy that organizes the field along two orthogonal
dimensions: a function-oriented taxonomy that clarifies the roles DMs play
within the RL pipeline, and a technique-oriented taxonomy that situates
implementations across online versus offline learning regimes. We also provide
a comprehensive examination of this progression from single-agent to
multi-agent domains, thereby forming several frameworks for DM-RL integration
and highlighting their practical utility. Furthermore, we outline several
categories of successful applications of diffusion-based RL across diverse
domains, discuss open research issues of current methodologies, and highlight
key directions for future research to advance the field. Finally, we summarize
the survey to identify promising future development directions. We are actively

Motivation: 现有LoRA重用方法依赖任务标签或额外训练，且通常激活固定数量的完整LoRA模块，导致参数冗余或不足，影响性能

Method: 定义rank-one组件(ROCs)，在序列级别自适应选择LoRA子集并确定ROC分配，在token级别进一步细化路由，仅激活最相关的ROCs

Conclusion: HiLoRA通过分层路由机制有效解决了LoRA重用中的参数效率问题，为领域泛化提供了实用的无需训练解决方案

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a widely used technique for
adapting large language models (LLMs) to new domains, due to its modular design
and broad availability on platforms such as HuggingFace. This availability has
motivated efforts to reuse existing LoRAs for domain generalization.
  However, existing methods often rely on explicit task labels or additional
training, which are impractical for deployment. Moreover, they typically
activate a fixed number of entire LoRA modules, leading to parameter redundancy
or insufficiency that degrade performance.
  In this paper, we propose \texttt{HiLoRA}, a training-free framework that
performs adaptive hierarchical routing over LoRA pools. Drawing on structural
properties of LoRA, we define rank-one components (ROCs), in which each rank
parameter is regarded as an independent unit. For a given input sequence,
\texttt{HiLoRA} first adaptively selects a subset of LoRAs and determines their
ROC allocation based on Gaussian likelihoods at the sequence level. At the
token level, it further refines routing by activating only the most informative
ROCs.
  We further provide theoretical guarantees that \texttt{HiLoRA} selects the
most relevant LoRAs with high probability.
  Extensive experiments show that \texttt{HiLoRA} achieves substantial
improvements in domain generalization, with accuracy gains of up to {\small
$55\%$} over state-of-the-art baselines, while maintaining comparable inference
throughput.

Abstract: Self-improvement has emerged as a state-of-the-art paradigm in Neural
Combinatorial Optimization (NCO), where models iteratively refine their
policies by generating and imitating high-quality solutions. Despite strong
empirical performance, existing methods face key limitations. Training is
computationally expensive, as policy updates require sampling numerous
candidate solutions per instance to extract a single expert trajectory. More
fundamentally, these approaches fail to exploit the structure of combinatorial
problems involving the coordination of multiple agents, such as vehicles in
min-max routing or machines in scheduling. By supervising on single-action
trajectories, they fail to exploit agent-permutation symmetries, where distinct
sequences of actions yield identical solutions, hindering generalization and
the ability to learn coordinated behavior.
  We address these challenges by extending self-improvement to operate over
joint multi-agent actions. Our model architecture predicts complete agent-task
assignments jointly at each decision step. To explicitly leverage symmetries,
we employ a set-prediction loss, which supervises the policy on multiple expert
assignments for any given state. This approach enhances sample efficiency and
the model's ability to learn coordinated behavior. Furthermore, by generating
multi-agent actions in parallel, it drastically accelerates the solution
generation phase of the self-improvement loop. Empirically, we validate our
method on several combinatorial problems, demonstrating consistent improvements
in the quality of the final solution and a reduced generation latency compared
to standard self-improvement.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了DeepSPI算法，将安全策略改进理论扩展到在线深度强化学习，通过限制策略更新范围确保单调改进和收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全策略改进理论主要关注离线表格强化学习，缺乏在在线设置中结合世界模型和表示学习的理论保证。

Method: 开发理论框架，限制策略更新到当前策略的邻域内，结合局部转移和奖励损失与正则化策略更新，提出DeepSPI算法。

Result: 在ALE-57基准测试中，DeepSPI匹配或超越了PPO和DeepMDPs等强基线方法，同时保持理论保证。

Conclusion: 成功将经典SPI定理扩展到在线深度强化学习，为结合世界模型和表示学习的策略改进提供了理论框架和实用算法。

Abstract: Safe policy improvement (SPI) offers theoretical control over policy updates,
yet existing guarantees largely concern offline, tabular reinforcement learning
(RL). We study SPI in general online settings, when combined with world model
and representation learning. We develop a theoretical framework showing that
restricting policy updates to a well-defined neighborhood of the current policy
ensures monotonic improvement and convergence. This analysis links transition
and reward prediction losses to representation quality, yielding online, "deep"
analogues of classical SPI theorems from the offline RL literature. Building on
these results, we introduce DeepSPI, a principled on-policy algorithm that
couples local transition and reward losses with regularised policy updates. On
the ALE-57 benchmark, DeepSPI matches or exceeds strong baselines, including
PPO and DeepMDPs, while retaining theoretical guarantees.

TL;DR: 提出了结合物理信息图神经网络和极值分析技术的新方法，用于改进泰国雨量站降雨预测，特别是在极端事件预测方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确预测降雨特别是极端事件在气候学和地球系统中仍然是一个重大挑战，传统机器学习模型在极端事件预测方面存在局限性。

Method: 使用图注意力网络与LSTM结合的方法，构建雨量站图结构表示，利用基于地形降水物理公式的初始边特征，并采用空间季节感知广义帕累托分布方法进行极值分析。

Result: 该方法在大多数区域包括易发极端事件的地区都优于现有基线模型，与SEAS5操作预报系统相比，在极端事件预测方面有所改进。

Abstract: Accurate rainfall forecasting, particularly for extreme events, remains a
significant challenge in climatology and the Earth system. This paper presents
novel physics-informed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) combined with extreme-value
analysis techniques to improve gauge-station rainfall predictions across
Thailand. The model leverages a graph-structured representation of gauge
stations to capture complex spatiotemporal patterns, and it offers
explainability through teleconnections. We preprocess relevant climate indices
that potentially influence regional rainfall. The proposed Graph Attention
Network with Long Short-Term Memory (Attention-LSTM) applies the attention
mechanism using initial edge features derived from simple
orographic-precipitation physics formulation. The embeddings are subsequently
processed by LSTM layers. To address extremes, we perform Peak-Over-Threshold
(POT) mapping using the novel Spatial Season-aware Generalized Pareto
Distribution (GPD) method, which overcomes limitations of traditional
machine-learning models. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
well-established baselines across most regions, including areas prone to
extremes, and remains strongly competitive with the state of the art. Compared
with the operational forecasting system SEAS5, our real-world application
improves extreme-event prediction and offers a practical enhancement to produce
fine-resolution maps that support decision-making in long-term water
management.

TL;DR: 首次对具有演化奖励函数的单时间尺度actor-critic算法进行有限时间收敛分析，证明在马尔可夫采样下可获得O(1/√T)收敛率，与静态奖励情况匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多实用RL算法使用演化奖励函数（如奖励塑造、熵正则化、课程学习），但缺乏理论分析基础。

Method: 分析单时间尺度actor-critic算法，考虑每个时间步变化的奖励参数对策略优化和价值估计的影响，在马尔可夫采样下建立理论框架。

Result: 在奖励参数演化足够慢的条件下，证明了actor和critic误差的O(1/√T)收敛率，与静态奖励的最佳已知率匹配。

Conclusion: 为许多流行的RL技术提供了理论基础，并在静态奖励情况下改进了分布不匹配分析，将最佳已知率提高了log²T倍。

Abstract: Many popular practical reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms employ evolving
reward functions-through techniques such as reward shaping, entropy
regularization, or curriculum learning-yet their theoretical foundations remain
underdeveloped. This paper provides the first finite-time convergence analysis
of a single-timescale actor-critic algorithm in the presence of an evolving
reward function under Markovian sampling. We consider a setting where the
reward parameters may change at each time step, affecting both policy
optimization and value estimation. Under standard assumptions, we derive
non-asymptotic bounds for both actor and critic errors. Our result shows that
an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate is achievable, matching the best-known rate
for static rewards, provided the reward parameters evolve slowly enough. This
rate is preserved when the reward is updated via a gradient-based rule with
bounded gradient and on the same timescale as the actor and critic, offering a
theoretical foundation for many popular RL techniques. As a secondary
contribution, we introduce a novel analysis of distribution mismatch under
Markovian sampling, improving the best-known rate by a factor of $\log^2T$ in
the static-reward case.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着用户使用私有信息与LLM交互，需要安全的加密通信。同态加密虽然支持加密数据计算，但文本生成特别是下一令牌预测仍是实际应用的主要障碍。

Method: 采用基于旅行商问题(TSP)的令牌重排序策略，结合后处理步骤减少近似误差，解决加密文本生成的困难。

Result: 理论分析和实验结果表明，该方法防止了生成崩溃，提高了生成文本的连贯性，并在整个过程中保护了数据隐私。

Conclusion: 这项工作推进了实用且保护隐私的LLM推理的可行性。

Abstract: As users increasingly interact with large language models (LLMs) using
private information, secure and encrypted communication becomes essential.
Homomorphic encryption (HE) provides a principled solution by enabling
computation directly on encrypted data. Although prior work has explored
aspects of running LLMs under HE, the challenge of text generation,
particularly next-token prediction, has received limited attention and remains
a key obstacle to practical encrypted interaction. In this work, we propose a
TSP-based token reordering strategy to address the difficulties of encrypted
text generation, together with a post-processing step that further reduces
approximation error. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate
that our method prevents collapse, improves coherence in generated text, and
preserves data privacy throughout. Overall, our contributions advance the
feasibility of practical and privacy-preserving LLM inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统错误检测方法主要关注单一模态（如表数据），难以处理电子商务和医疗等领域中常见的跨模态错误，需要开发能够处理图像、表格和文本数据共存的跨模态错误检测方法。

Method: 在四个数据集上对五种基线方法进行基准测试，包括Cleanlab（标签错误检测框架）和DataScope（数据估值方法），并与强大的AutoML框架配对使用。

Result: Cleanlab和DataScope在结合AutoML框架时取得了最高的F1分数，表明它们在跨模态错误检测方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: 当前方法在处理真实世界重尾数据时仍存在局限性，需要在这一领域进行进一步研究。

Abstract: Ensuring data quality at scale remains a persistent challenge for large
organizations. Despite recent advances, maintaining accurate and consistent
data is still complex, especially when dealing with multiple data modalities.
Traditional error detection and correction methods tend to focus on a single
modality, typically a table, and often miss cross-modal errors that are common
in domains like e-Commerce and healthcare, where image, tabular, and text data
co-exist. To address this gap, we take an initial step towards cross-modal
error detection in tabular data, by benchmarking several methods. Our
evaluation spans four datasets and five baseline approaches. Among them,
Cleanlab, a label error detection framework, and DataScope, a data valuation
method, perform the best when paired with a strong AutoML framework, achieving
the highest F1 scores. Our findings indicate that current methods remain
limited, particularly when applied to heavy-tailed real-world data, motivating
further research in this area.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN预训练方法主要针对同构图设计，而现实图多为异构图，且存在语义不匹配问题（原始数据与理想可转移语义信息数据之间的差异）。

Method: 设计结构感知预训练任务捕捉异构图结构特性；设计语义感知预训练任务，通过构建由语义邻居组成的扰动子空间来处理语义不匹配问题。

Result: 在真实世界大规模异构图上的广泛实验表明，该方法优于现有最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效预训练异构图神经网络，通过结构感知和语义感知任务学习具有更好可转移性的知识。

Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have facilitated the
development of graph data mining. However, training GNNs requires sufficient
labeled task-specific data, which is expensive and sometimes unavailable. To be
less dependent on labeled data, recent studies propose to pre-train GNNs in a
self-supervised manner and then apply the pre-trained GNNs to downstream tasks
with limited labeled data. However, most existing methods are designed solely
for homogeneous graphs (real-world graphs are mostly heterogeneous) and do not
consider semantic mismatch (the semantic difference between the original data
and the ideal data containing more transferable semantic information). In this
paper, we propose an effective framework to pre-train GNNs on the large-scale
heterogeneous graph. We first design a structure-aware pre-training task, which
aims to capture structural properties in heterogeneous graphs. Then, we design
a semantic-aware pre-training task to tackle the mismatch. Specifically, we
construct a perturbation subspace composed of semantic neighbors to help deal
with the semantic mismatch. Semantic neighbors make the model focus more on the
general knowledge in the semantic space, which in turn assists the model in
learning knowledge with better transferability. Finally, extensive experiments
are conducted on real-world large-scale heterogeneous graphs to demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines. Code

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Cautious Weight Decay (CWD) 是一种优化器无关的权重衰减方法，只在参数坐标与优化器更新方向一致时应用衰减，无需额外调参即可提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准解耦衰减会隐式优化正则化或约束目标，而CWD旨在保持原始损失函数不变，在达到稳定流形时诱导滑动模式行为，寻找未修改目标的局部帕累托最优稳定点。

Method: CWD是一种单行修改，仅对与优化器更新方向一致的参数坐标应用权重衰减，适用于AdamW、Lion、Muon等优化器，无需新超参数或额外调优。

Result: 在语言模型预训练和ImageNet分类任务中，CWD在百万到十亿参数规模下持续改善最终损失和准确率。

Conclusion: CWD作为一种即插即用的优化器改进方法，能够有效提升模型性能，且无需额外调参成本。

Abstract: We introduce Cautious Weight Decay (CWD), a one-line, optimizer-agnostic
modification that applies weight decay only to parameter coordinates whose
signs align with the optimizer update. Unlike standard decoupled decay, which
implicitly optimizes a regularized or constrained objective, CWD preserves the
original loss and admits a bilevel interpretation: it induces sliding-mode
behavior upon reaching the stationary manifold, allowing it to search for
locally Pareto-optimal stationary points of the unmodified objective. In
practice, CWD is a drop-in change for optimizers such as AdamW, Lion, and Muon,
requiring no new hyperparameters or additional tuning. For language model
pre-training and ImageNet classification, CWD consistently improves final loss
and accuracy at million- to billion-parameter scales.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前用于评估生成式AI模型生成无机晶体材料的距离函数存在四个主要问题：无法量化化合物间相似程度、不能区分成分差异和结构差异、缺乏对原子坐标位移的Lipschitz连续性、以及独特性度量对生成样本排列不具不变性。

Method: 提出两种连续距离函数来评估生成样本的独特性和新颖性，这些距离函数在理论上克服了传统方法的局限性。

Result: 实验表明，新提出的距离函数能够揭示传统距离函数遗漏的洞察，为评估和比较无机晶体的生成模型提供了更可靠的基础。

Conclusion: 连续距离函数为生成式AI模型在无机晶体材料生成领域的评估提供了更准确和可靠的方法，能够更好地揭示模型性能的细微差异。

Abstract: To address pressing scientific challenges such as climate change,
increasingly sophisticated generative artificial intelligence models are being
developed that can efficiently sample the large chemical space of possible
functional materials. These models can quickly sample new chemical compositions
paired with crystal structures. They are typically evaluated using uniqueness
and novelty metrics, which depend on a chosen crystal distance function.
However, the most prevalent distance function has four limitations: it fails to
quantify the degree of similarity between compounds, cannot distinguish
compositional difference and structural difference, lacks Lipschitz continuity
against shifts in atomic coordinates, and results in a uniqueness metric that
is not invariant against the permutation of generated samples. In this work, we
propose using two continuous distance functions to evaluate uniqueness and
novelty, which theoretically overcome these limitations. Our experiments show
that these distances reveal insights missed by traditional distance functions,
providing a more reliable basis for evaluating and comparing generative models
for inorganic crystals.

TL;DR: 提出基于高斯过程的非参数动态定价方法，使用贝叶斯优化来学习需求函数，在无限和有限库存场景下都优于传统强化学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动态定价方法通常假设需求函数的特定参数形式，这在现实场景中可能不成立，限制了方法的适用性。

Method: 使用高斯过程对需求函数进行非参数建模，基于贝叶斯优化开发定价算法，适用于无限和有限库存两种场景。

Result: 实验表明，基于贝叶斯优化的方法在收益方面优于多种最先进的强化学习算法，需要更少的假设且具有更好的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯优化是复杂不确定环境中动态定价的强大实用工具，提供了后悔保证来量化学习效率。

Abstract: Dynamic pricing is the practice of adjusting the selling price of a product
to maximize a firm's revenue by responding to market demand. The literature
typically distinguishes between two settings: infinite inventory, where the
firm has unlimited stock and time to sell, and finite inventory, where both
inventory and selling horizon are limited. In both cases, the central challenge
lies in the fact that the demand function -- how sales respond to price -- is
unknown and must be learned from data. Traditional approaches often assume a
specific parametric form for the demand function, enabling the use of
reinforcement learning (RL) to identify near-optimal pricing strategies.
However, such assumptions may not hold in real-world scenarios, limiting the
applicability of these methods. In this work, we propose a Gaussian Process
(GP) based nonparametric approach to dynamic pricing that avoids restrictive
modeling assumptions. We treat the demand function as a black-box function of
the price and develop pricing algorithms based on Bayesian Optimization (BO) --
a sample-efficient method for optimizing unknown functions. We present BO-based
algorithms tailored for both infinite and finite inventory settings and provide
regret guarantees for both regimes, thereby quantifying the learning efficiency
of our methods. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our BO-based
methods outperform several state-of-the-art RL algorithms in terms of revenue,
while requiring fewer assumptions and offering greater robustness. This
highlights Bayesian Optimization as a powerful and practical tool for dynamic
pricing in complex, uncertain environments.

TL;DR: 该论文重新审视了平坦最小值与泛化能力的关系，提出锐度应被视为函数依赖属性而非泛化能力差的可靠指标。研究发现正则化方法会产生更锐利的最小值，但这些最小值反而能带来更好的泛化、校准、鲁棒性和功能一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新评估平坦最小值与泛化能力之间的复杂关系，挑战传统认知，探索锐度作为函数依赖属性的新视角。

Method: 进行广泛的实证研究，从单目标优化到现代图像分类任务，比较不同正则化方法（如SAM、权重衰减、数据增强）下的损失景观几何特性。

Result: 正则化模型倾向于收敛到更锐利的最小值，但这些最小值在泛化、校准、鲁棒性和功能一致性方面表现更好；无正则化的基线模型虽然收敛到更平坦的最小值，但在所有安全指标上表现更差。

Conclusion: 函数复杂性而非平坦度单独决定解空间的几何特性，锐利的最小值可能反映更合适的归纳偏置，需要对损失景观几何进行以函数为中心的重新评估。

Abstract: Flat minima are widely believed to correlate with improved generalisation in
deep neural networks. However, this connection has proven more nuanced in
recent studies, with both theoretical counterexamples and empirical exceptions
emerging in the literature. In this paper, we revisit the role of sharpness in
model performance, proposing that sharpness is better understood as a
function-dependent property rather than a reliable indicator of poor
generalisation. We conduct extensive empirical studies, from single-objective
optimisation to modern image classification tasks, showing that sharper minima
often emerge when models are regularised (e.g., via SAM, weight decay, or data
augmentation), and that these sharp minima can coincide with better
generalisation, calibration, robustness, and functional consistency. Across a
range of models and datasets, we find that baselines without regularisation
tend to converge to flatter minima yet often perform worse across all safety
metrics. Our findings demonstrate that function complexity, rather than
flatness alone, governs the geometry of solutions, and that sharper minima can
reflect more appropriate inductive biases (especially under regularisation),
calling for a function-centric reappraisal of loss landscape geometry.

Motivation: 传统扩散模型在处理复杂分布间的转换任务时存在局限，而桥匹配方法在时间相关数据序列中的应用尚未探索，这对于需要保持时间一致性的视频任务至关重要。

Method: TCVBM框架扩展桥匹配到视频领域，在扩散桥中显式建模序列间依赖关系，将时间相关性直接融入采样过程。

Result: 在帧插值、图像到视频生成和视频超分辨率三个任务中，TCVBM在多个定量指标上均优于基于桥匹配和扩散模型的传统方法。

Conclusion: TCVBM通过显式建模时间相关性，显著提升了视频生成质量和重建保真度，为时间相关数据序列的处理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel in noise-to-data generation tasks, providing a mapping
from a Gaussian distribution to a more complex data distribution. However they
struggle to model translations between complex distributions, limiting their
effectiveness in data-to-data tasks. While Bridge Matching (BM) models address
this by finding the translation between data distributions, their application
to time-correlated data sequences remains unexplored. This is a critical
limitation for video generation and manipulation tasks, where maintaining
temporal coherence is particularly important. To address this gap, we propose
Time-Correlated Video Bridge Matching (TCVBM), a framework that extends BM to
time-correlated data sequences in the video domain. TCVBM explicitly models
inter-sequence dependencies within the diffusion bridge, directly incorporating
temporal correlations into the sampling process. We compare our approach to
classical methods based on bridge matching and diffusion models for three
video-related tasks: frame interpolation, image-to-video generation, and video
super-resolution. TCVBM achieves superior performance across multiple
quantitative metrics, demonstrating enhanced generation quality and
reconstruction fidelity.

TL;DR: 提出了CrossAD框架，通过跨尺度关联和跨窗口建模进行时间序列异常检测，在多尺度建模中显式捕获跨尺度关联，并利用全局多尺度上下文克服固定窗口限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多尺度建模中往往独立处理不同尺度或使用简单特征融合策略，忽略了异常发生时跨尺度关联的动态变化，且基于固定滑动窗口限制了上下文信息的捕获能力。

Method: 提出跨尺度重建方法，从粗粒度序列重建细粒度序列以显式捕获跨尺度关联；设计查询库并整合全局多尺度上下文来克服固定窗口大小的限制。

Result: 在多个真实世界数据集上使用九种评估指标进行的广泛实验验证了CrossAD的有效性，在异常检测方面展现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: CrossAD框架通过有效建模跨尺度关联和跨窗口上下文，显著提升了时间序列异常检测的性能，为多尺度建模提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection plays a crucial role in a wide range of
real-world applications. Given that time series data can exhibit different
patterns at different sampling granularities, multi-scale modeling has proven
beneficial for uncovering latent anomaly patterns that may not be apparent at a
single scale. However, existing methods often model multi-scale information
independently or rely on simple feature fusion strategies, neglecting the
dynamic changes in cross-scale associations that occur during anomalies.
Moreover, most approaches perform multi-scale modeling based on fixed sliding
windows, which limits their ability to capture comprehensive contextual
information. In this work, we propose CrossAD, a novel framework for time
series Anomaly Detection that takes Cross-scale associations and Cross-window
modeling into account. We propose a cross-scale reconstruction that
reconstructs fine-grained series from coarser series, explicitly capturing
cross-scale associations. Furthermore, we design a query library and
incorporate global multi-scale context to overcome the limitations imposed by
fixed window sizes. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world
datasets using nine evaluation metrics validate the effectiveness of CrossAD,
demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection.

Motivation: 随着数字经济发展，组织间数据协作需求增长，但隐私问题使直接数据共享不可行。现有垂直联邦学习存在计算资源利用率低、训练效率差的问题，同步依赖设计增加训练延迟，参与者的资源和数据异构性进一步阻碍高效计算。

Conclusion: PubSub-VFL通过创新的发布/订阅架构有效解决了垂直联邦学习中的效率和资源利用问题，为安全高效的跨组织数据协作提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of the digital economy, data collaboration between
organizations has become a well-established business model, driving the growth
of various industries. However, privacy concerns make direct data sharing
impractical. To address this, Two-Party Split Learning (a.k.a. Vertical
Federated Learning (VFL)) has emerged as a promising solution for secure
collaborative learning. Despite its advantages, this architecture still suffers
from low computational resource utilization and training efficiency.
Specifically, its synchronous dependency design increases training latency,
while resource and data heterogeneity among participants further hinder
efficient computation. To overcome these challenges, we propose PubSub-VFL, a
novel VFL paradigm with a Publisher/Subscriber architecture optimized for
two-party collaborative learning with high computational efficiency. PubSub-VFL
leverages the decoupling capabilities of the Pub/Sub architecture and the data
parallelism of the parameter server architecture to design a hierarchical
asynchronous mechanism, reducing training latency and improving system
efficiency. Additionally, to mitigate the training imbalance caused by resource
and data heterogeneity, we formalize an optimization problem based on
participants' system profiles, enabling the selection of optimal
hyperparameters while preserving privacy. We conduct a theoretical analysis to
demonstrate that PubSub-VFL achieves stable convergence and is compatible with
security protocols such as differential privacy. Extensive case studies on five
benchmark datasets further validate its effectiveness, showing that, compared
to state-of-the-art baselines, PubSub-VFL not only accelerates training by $2
\sim 7\times$ without compromising accuracy, but also achieves a computational

TL;DR: 本文发现扩散模型采样过程中存在噪声偏移问题，即预定义噪声水平与中间状态实际噪声水平不匹配，并提出噪声感知引导(NAG)方法进行校正。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去噪生成模型在采样过程中存在长期被忽视但普遍的问题：预定义噪声水平与中间状态实际编码的噪声水平之间存在偏差，这种噪声偏移会导致次优生成质量。

Method: 提出噪声感知引导(NAG)方法，显式引导采样轨迹保持与预定义噪声调度的一致性；进一步引入无分类器变体，通过噪声条件丢弃联合训练噪声条件模型和无噪声条件模型。

Result: 在ImageNet生成和各种监督微调任务上的广泛实验表明，NAG能持续缓解噪声偏移，显著提升主流扩散模型的生成质量。

Conclusion: 噪声偏移是扩散模型中的普遍问题，NAG提供了一种简单有效的校正方法，无需外部分类器即可改善生成性能。

Abstract: Existing denoising generative models rely on solving discretized reverse-time
SDEs or ODEs. In this paper, we identify a long-overlooked yet pervasive issue
in this family of models: a misalignment between the pre-defined noise level
and the actual noise level encoded in intermediate states during sampling. We
refer to this misalignment as noise shift. Through empirical analysis, we
demonstrate that noise shift is widespread in modern diffusion models and
exhibits a systematic bias, leading to sub-optimal generation due to both
out-of-distribution generalization and inaccurate denoising updates. To address
this problem, we propose Noise Awareness Guidance (NAG), a simple yet effective
correction method that explicitly steers sampling trajectories to remain
consistent with the pre-defined noise schedule. We further introduce a
classifier-free variant of NAG, which jointly trains a noise-conditional and a
noise-unconditional model via noise-condition dropout, thereby eliminating the
need for external classifiers. Extensive experiments, including ImageNet
generation and various supervised fine-tuning tasks, show that NAG consistently
mitigates noise shift and substantially improves the generation quality of
mainstream diffusion models.

Motivation: 因果发现算法通常依赖于难以在真实数据中满足的因果假设，这限制了因果发现在实际场景中的广泛应用。

Method: 在八种模型假设违反情况下，对假设独立同分布数据的各种主流因果发现算法进行实证性能基准测试。

Result: 实验结果显示，可微分因果发现方法在常用挑战性场景下（除尺度变化外）在推断图的结构汉明距离和结构干预距离指标上表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该工作旨在全面基准测试可微分因果发现方法在模型假设违反下的性能，为合理评估因果发现提供标准，并进一步促进其在真实场景中的应用。

Abstract: Causal discovery aims to learn causal relationships between variables from
targeted data, making it a fundamental task in machine learning. However,
causal discovery algorithms often rely on unverifiable causal assumptions,
which are usually difficult to satisfy in real-world data, thereby limiting the
broad application of causal discovery in practical scenarios. Inspired by these
considerations, this work extensively benchmarks the empirical performance of
various mainstream causal discovery algorithms, which assume i.i.d. data, under
eight model assumption violations. Our experimental results show that
differentiable causal discovery methods exhibit robustness under the metrics of
Structural Hamming Distance and Structural Intervention Distance of the
inferred graphs in commonly used challenging scenarios, except for scale
variation. We also provide the theoretical explanations for the performance of
differentiable causal discovery methods. Finally, our work aims to
comprehensively benchmark the performance of recent differentiable causal
discovery methods under model assumption violations, and provide the standard
for reasonable evaluation of causal discovery, as well as to further promote
its application in real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 解决现实应用中需要公平收益分配的问题，特别是在存在上下文变化的情况下，确保每个选项都能获得最低保障收益。

Method: 设计了两种算法：乐观优先考虑性能的算法和悲观强制约束满足的算法。针对每种算法推导了问题相关的遗憾和约束违反上界。

Result: 建立了问题相关的遗憾和约束违反上界，并证明了对时间范围依赖的最优性，揭示了先前工作中自由探索原则的基本局限性。

Conclusion: 该研究为具有跨上下文最小奖励约束的多臂老虎机问题提供了有效的算法解决方案，并在理论上证明了其最优性。

Abstract: We examine a multi-armed bandit problem with contextual information, where
the objective is to ensure that each arm receives a minimum aggregated reward
across contexts while simultaneously maximizing the total cumulative reward.
This framework captures a broad class of real-world applications where fair
revenue allocation is critical and contextual variation is inherent. The
cross-context aggregation of minimum reward constraints, while enabling better
performance and easier feasibility, introduces significant technical challenges
-- particularly the absence of closed-form optimal allocations typically
available in standard MAB settings. We design and analyze algorithms that
either optimistically prioritize performance or pessimistically enforce
constraint satisfaction. For each algorithm, we derive problem-dependent upper
bounds on both regret and constraint violations. Furthermore, we establish a
lower bound demonstrating that the dependence on the time horizon in our
results is optimal in general and revealing fundamental limitations of the free
exploration principle leveraged in prior work.

Abstract: Cross-silo federated learning (FL) is a promising approach to enable
cross-organization collaboration in machine learning model development without
directly sharing private data. Despite growing organizational interest driven
by data protection regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, the adoption of
cross-silo FL remains limited in practice. In this paper, we conduct an
interview study to understand the practical challenges associated with
cross-silo FL adoption. With interviews spanning a diverse set of stakeholders
such as user organizations, software providers, and academic researchers, we
uncover various barriers, from concerns about model performance to questions of
incentives and trust between participating organizations. Our study shows that
cross-silo FL faces a set of challenges that have yet to be well-captured by
existing research in the area and are quite distinct from other forms of
federated learning such as cross-device FL. We end with a discussion on future
research directions that can help overcome these challenges.

Motivation: 理解知识蒸馏的功能性影响，量化其压缩能力和知识转移机制，解耦压缩与架构缩减的关系。

Method: 采用假设检验、控制实验和随机控制蒸馏方法，分析多种蒸馏变体和模型尺寸的蒸馏缩放规律。

Result: 在12个实验设置、9种架构和7个数据集上，知识转移程度低于预期，存在显著的负知识不对称转移。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏主要作为数据依赖的正则化器，而非压缩机制，且存在负知识不对称转移的安全隐患。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is often considered a compression mechanism when
judged on the resulting student's accuracy and loss, yet its functional impact
is poorly understood. In this work, we quantify the compression capacity of
knowledge distillation and the resulting knowledge transfer from a functional
perspective, decoupling compression from architectural reduction, which
provides an improved understanding of knowledge distillation. We employ
hypothesis testing, controls, and random control distillation to understand
knowledge transfer mechanisms across data modalities. To rigorously test the
breadth and limits of our analyses, we explore multiple distillation variants
and analyse distillation scaling laws across model sizes. Our findings
demonstrate that, while there is statistically significant knowledge transfer
in some modalities and architectures, the extent of this transfer is less
pronounced than anticipated, even under conditions designed to maximise
knowledge sharing. Notably, in cases of significant knowledge transfer, we
identify a consistent and severe asymmetric transfer of negative knowledge to
the student, raising safety concerns in knowledge distillation applications.
Across 12 experimental setups, 9 architectures, and 7 datasets, our findings
show that knowledge distillation functions less as a compression mechanism and
more as a data-dependent regulariser with a negative asymmetric payoff.

Conclusion: 通过解耦变量发现和动力学建模，该方法为高维动力学系统的粗粒化提供了更稳定和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: High-dimensional recordings of dynamical processes are often characterized by
a much smaller set of effective variables, evolving on low-dimensional
manifolds. Identifying these latent dynamics requires solving two intertwined
problems: discovering appropriate coarse-grained variables and simultaneously
fitting the governing equations. Most machine learning approaches tackle these
tasks jointly by training autoencoders together with models that enforce
dynamical consistency. We propose to decouple the two problems by leveraging
the recently introduced Foundation Inference Models (FIMs). FIMs are pretrained
models that estimate the infinitesimal generators of dynamical systems (e.g.,
the drift and diffusion of a stochastic differential equation) in zero-shot
mode. By amortizing the inference of the dynamics through a FIM with frozen
weights, and training only the encoder-decoder map, we define a simple,
simulation-consistent loss that stabilizes representation learning. A proof of
concept on a stochastic double-well system with semicircle diffusion, embedded
into synthetic video data, illustrates the potential of this approach for fast
and reusable coarse-graining pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主动特征获取方法通常针对单一预定任务，缺乏可扩展性，且面临特征系统性缺失和任务特定标签有限的问题。

Method: L2M包含可靠的未见任务不确定性量化和基于不确定性的贪婪特征获取代理，采用序列建模或自回归预训练方法处理任意缺失模式的数据。

Result: 在合成和真实表格基准测试中，L2M匹配或超越了任务特定基线方法，特别是在标签稀缺和高缺失率情况下表现更优。

Conclusion: L2M能够直接在具有回顾性缺失的数据集上操作，实现上下文中的元主动特征获取，无需每个任务重新训练，具有良好的可扩展性。

Abstract: Active feature acquisition (AFA) is a sequential decision-making problem
where the goal is to improve model performance for test instances by adaptively
selecting which features to acquire. In practice, AFA methods often learn from
retrospective data with systematic missingness in the features and limited
task-specific labels. Most prior work addresses acquisition for a single
predetermined task, limiting scalability. To address this limitation, we
formalize the meta-AFA problem, where the goal is to learn acquisition policies
across various tasks. We introduce Learning-to-Measure (L2M), which consists of
i) reliable uncertainty quantification over unseen tasks, and ii) an
uncertainty-guided greedy feature acquisition agent that maximizes conditional
mutual information. We demonstrate a sequence-modeling or autoregressive
pre-training approach that underpins reliable uncertainty quantification for
tasks with arbitrary missingness. L2M operates directly on datasets with
retrospective missingness and performs the meta-AFA task in-context,
eliminating per-task retraining. Across synthetic and real-world tabular
benchmarks, L2M matches or surpasses task-specific baselines, particularly
under scarce labels and high missingness.

Motivation: 现有RL框架在扩展性上存在限制，由于RL轨迹生成的极端长尾偏斜导致严重的GPU利用率不足。全局权重同步机制不适合RL训练中高度偏斜和演化的轨迹生成延迟分布。

Method: 提出Laminar系统，采用完全解耦架构：1) 用中继工作器层替代全局更新，实现异步细粒度权重同步；2) 动态重打包机制将长尾轨迹整合到专用rollout上；3) 完全解耦设计隔离故障。

Result: 在1024-GPU集群上的评估显示，Laminar相比最先进系统实现了最高5.48倍的训练吞吐量加速，同时减少了模型收敛时间。

Conclusion: Laminar通过轨迹级异步和完全解耦架构，显著提升了RL后训练的可扩展性和效率，解决了现有系统在大型集群上的扩展瓶颈。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training for Large Language Models (LLMs) is
now scaling to large clusters and running for extended durations to enhance
model reasoning performance. However, the scalability of existing RL frameworks
is limited, as extreme long-tail skewness in RL trajectory generation causes
severe GPU underutilization. Current asynchronous RL systems attempt to
mitigate this, but they rely on global weight synchronization between the actor
and all rollouts, which creates a rigid model update schedule. This global
synchronization is ill-suited for the highly skewed and evolving distribution
of trajectory generation latency in RL training, crippling training efficiency.
Our key insight is that efficient scaling requires breaking this lockstep
through trajectory-level asynchrony, which generates and consumes each
trajectory independently. We propose Laminar, a scalable and robust RL
post-training system built on a fully decoupled architecture. First, we replace
global updates with a tier of relay workers acting as a distributed parameter
service. This enables asynchronous and fine-grained weight synchronization,
allowing rollouts to pull the latest weight anytime without stalling the
actor's training loop. Second, a dynamic repack mechanism consolidates
long-tail trajectories onto a few dedicated rollouts, maximizing generation
throughput. The fully decoupled design also isolates failures, ensuring
robustness for long-running jobs. Our evaluation on a 1024-GPU cluster shows
that Laminar achieves up to 5.48$\times$ training throughput speedup over
state-of-the-art systems, while reducing model convergence time.

TL;DR: 提出了Bellman Wasserstein距离（BWD），一种无需训练智能体即可评估离线数据集质量的方法，该指标与离线RL算法性能强相关，并能作为正则化器提升策略优化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习依赖静态数据集，但数据集质量差异很大且难以预先评估。需要一种无需环境交互就能估计数据集质量的方法，以指导算法选择和策略优化。

Method: 引入Bellman Wasserstein距离（BWD），这是一种基于价值感知的最优传输评分，通过行为评论家和状态条件最优传输公式计算，衡量数据集行为策略与随机参考策略的差异程度。

Result: 在D4RL MuJoCo任务中，BWD与多个离线RL算法的聚合性能评分强相关，能有效预测标准智能体在给定数据集上的表现。作为正则化器使用时，能显式推动学习策略远离随机行为并提高回报。

Conclusion: 价值感知的分布信号如BWD是处理离线RL数据集筛选和策略优化的实用工具。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) learns exclusively from static datasets,
without further interaction with the environment. In practice, such datasets
vary widely in quality, often mixing expert, suboptimal, and even random
trajectories. The choice of algorithm therefore depends on dataset fidelity.
Behavior cloning can suffice on high-quality data, whereas mixed- or
low-quality data typically benefits from offline RL methods that stitch useful
behavior across trajectories. Yet in the wild it is difficult to assess dataset
quality a priori because the data's provenance and skill composition are
unknown. We address the problem of estimating offline dataset quality without
training an agent. We study a spectrum of proxies from simple cumulative
rewards to learned value based estimators, and introduce the Bellman
Wasserstein distance (BWD), a value aware optimal transport score that measures
how dissimilar a dataset's behavioral policy is from a random reference policy.
BWD is computed from a behavioral critic and a state conditional OT
formulation, requiring no environment interaction or full policy optimization.
Across D4RL MuJoCo tasks, BWD strongly correlates with an oracle performance
score that aggregates multiple offline RL algorithms, enabling efficient
prediction of how well standard agents will perform on a given dataset. Beyond
prediction, integrating BWD as a regularizer during policy optimization
explicitly pushes the learned policy away from random behavior and improves
returns. These results indicate that value aware, distributional signals such
as BWD are practical tools for triaging offline RL datasets and policy
optimization.

Abstract: Many scientific fields, from medicine to seismology, rely on analyzing
sequences of events over time to understand complex systems. Traditionally,
machine learning models must be built and trained from scratch for each new
dataset, which is a slow and costly process. We introduce a new approach: a
single, powerful model that learns the underlying patterns of event data in
context. We trained this "foundation model" on millions of simulated event
sequences, teaching it a general-purpose understanding of how events can
unfold. As a result, our model can analyze new scientific data instantly,
without retraining, simply by looking at a few examples from the dataset. It
can also be quickly fine-tuned for even higher accuracy. This approach makes
sophisticated event analysis more accessible and accelerates the pace of
scientific discovery.

Abstract: Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describe dynamical systems evolving
deterministically in continuous time. Accurate data-driven modeling of systems
as ODEs, a central problem across the natural sciences, remains challenging,
especially if the data is sparse or noisy. We introduce FIM-ODE (Foundation
Inference Model for ODEs), a pretrained neural model designed to estimate ODEs
zero-shot (i.e., in context) from sparse and noisy observations. Trained on
synthetic data, the model utilizes a flexible neural operator for robust ODE
inference, even from corrupted data. We empirically verify that FIM-ODE
provides accurate estimates, on par with a neural state-of-the-art method, and
qualitatively compare the structure of their estimated vector fields.

Conclusion: SG-XDEAT通过双流表示学习和自适应噪声抑制机制，为表格数据学习提供了一个更鲁棒的深度学习框架。

Abstract: We propose SG-XDEAT (Sparsity-Guided Cross Dimensional and Cross-Encoding
Attention with Target Aware Conditioning), a novel framework designed for
supervised learning on tabular data. At its core, SG-XDEAT employs a
dual-stream encoder that decomposes each input feature into two parallel
representations: a raw value stream and a target-conditioned (label-aware)
stream. These dual representations are then propagated through a hierarchical
stack of attention-based modules. SG-XDEAT integrates three key components: (i)
Cross-Dimensional self-attention, which captures intra-view dependencies among
features within each stream; (ii) Cross-Encoding self-attention, which enables
bidirectional interaction between raw and target-aware representations; and
(iii) an Adaptive Sparse Self-Attention (ASSA) mechanism, which dynamically
suppresses low-utility tokens by driving their attention weights toward
zero--thereby mitigating the impact of noise. Empirical results on multiple
public benchmarks show consistent gains over strong baselines, confirming that
jointly modeling raw and target-aware views--while adaptively filtering
noise--yields a more robust deep tabular learner.

Abstract: Whisper models have achieved remarkable progress in speech recognition; yet
their large size remains a bottleneck for deployment on resource-constrained

Abstract: Spectral clustering is a fundamental method for graph partitioning, but its
reliance on eigenvector computation limits scalability to massive graphs.
Classical sparsification methods preserve spectral properties by sampling edges
proportionally to their effective resistances, but require expensive
preprocessing to estimate these resistances. We study whether uniform edge
sampling-a simple, structure-agnostic strategy-can suffice for spectral
clustering. Our main result shows that for graphs admitting a well-separated
$k$-clustering, characterized by a large structure ratio $\Upsilon(k) =
\lambda_{k+1} / \rho_G(k)$, uniform sampling preserves the spectral subspace
used for clustering. Specifically, we prove that uniformly sampling $O(\gamma^2
n \log n / \epsilon^2)$ edges, where $\gamma$ is the Laplacian condition
number, yields a sparsifier whose top $(n-k)$-dimensional eigenspace is
approximately orthogonal to the cluster indicators. This ensures that the
spectral embedding remains faithful, and clustering quality is preserved. Our
analysis introduces new resistance bounds for intra-cluster edges, a
rank-$(n-k)$ effective resistance formulation, and a matrix Chernoff bound
adapted to the dominant eigenspace. These tools allow us to bypass importance
sampling entirely. Conceptually, our result connects recent coreset-based
clustering theory to spectral sparsification, showing that under strong
clusterability, even uniform sampling is structure-aware. This provides the
first provable guarantee that uniform edge sampling suffices for
structure-preserving spectral clustering.

TL;DR: CALM是一种推理时方法，通过修改模型最后一层的潜在表示来抑制有害概念，无需重新训练，结合计算机视觉中的CW技术和正交投影技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型容易受到越狱攻击，绕过内置安全防护（例如通过对抗性提示欺骗模型）。

Method: 使用CW技术和正交投影修改模型最后一层的潜在表示，移除与有害内容相关的潜在方向，同时保持模型性能。

Result: CALM减少了有害输出，在大多数指标上优于基线方法，仅带来较小的推理计算开销。

Conclusion: CALM提供了一种轻量级的AI安全方法，无需额外训练数据或模型微调，仅需在推理时进行少量计算。

Abstract: Large Language Models are susceptible to jailbreak attacks that bypass
built-in safety guardrails (e.g., by tricking the model with adversarial
prompts). We propose Concept Alignment and Concept Manipulation \textbf{CALM},
an inference-time method that suppresses harmful concepts by modifying latent
representations of the last layer of the model, without retraining. Leveraging
\gls*{cw} technique from Computer Vision combined with orthogonal projection,
CALM removes unwanted latent directions associated with harmful content while
preserving model performance. Experiments show that CALM reduces harmful
outputs and outperforms baseline methods in most metrics, offering a
lightweight approach to AI safety with no additional training data or model
fine-tuning, while incurring only a small computational overhead at inference.

TL;DR: 当前混合思维LLM存在模式分离不完整问题，推理行为会泄露到非思维模式中。研究发现四个关键因素影响可控性，并提出改进方案，显著减少非思维模式的输出长度和推理支持标记出现。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合思维LLM在效率和推理能力之间提供平衡，但现有模型存在模式分离不完整的问题，需要理解并改善其可控性。

Method: 分析影响可控性的关键因素，包括数据规模、思维/非思维答案来源、非思维数据数量调整，以及两阶段训练策略。基于这些发现提出实用方案。

Conclusion: 当前混合思维存在局限性，研究结果为加强其可控性提供了方向。

Abstract: Hybrid thinking enables LLMs to switch between reasoning and direct
answering, offering a balance between efficiency and reasoning capability. Yet
our experiments reveal that current hybrid thinking LLMs only achieve partial
mode separation: reasoning behaviors often leak into the no-think mode. To
understand and mitigate this, we analyze the factors influencing
controllability and identify four that matter most: (1) larger data scale, (2)
using think and no-think answers from different questions rather than the same
question, (3) a moderate increase in no-think data number, and (4) a two-phase
strategy that first trains reasoning ability and then applies hybrid think
training. Building on these findings, we propose a practical recipe that,
compared to standard training, can maintain accuracy in both modes while
significantly reducing no-think output length (from $1085$ to $585$ on MATH500)
and occurrences of reasoning-supportive tokens such as ``\texttt{wait}'' (from
$5917$ to $522$ on MATH500). Our findings highlight the limitations of current
hybrid thinking and offer directions for strengthening its controllability.

TL;DR: 提出了CoRA框架，通过保持预训练基础模型参数不变，结合Granger因果嵌入和零初始化条件注入机制，有效整合多模态外生协变量，提升时间序列基础模型的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型主要在单变量时间序列上预训练，忽视了现实预测任务中多变量间的重要依赖关系和多样化协变量信息，限制了模型性能。

Method: CoRA框架将预训练基础模型作为冻结特征提取器，使用Granger因果嵌入自动评估协变量的因果预测能力，通过零初始化条件注入机制逐步整合外生信息，避免灾难性遗忘。

Result: 实验表明CoRA在协变量感知预测任务上比现有最优方法降低了31.1%的MSE，在完整或少量训练样本下均表现优异，且与多种先进时间序列基础模型兼容。

Conclusion: CoRA为时间序列基础模型提供了一种实用的协变量感知适应范式，能够有效整合多模态协变量信息，显著提升预测性能。

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have shown significant impact through
their model capacity, scalability, and zero-shot generalization. However, due
to the heterogeneity of inter-variate dependencies and the backbone scalability
on large-scale multivariate datasets, most TSFMs are typically pre-trained on
univariate time series. This limitation renders them oblivious to crucial
information from diverse covariates in real-world forecasting tasks. To further
enhance the performance of TSFMs, we propose a general covariate-aware
adaptation (CoRA) framework for TSFMs. It leverages pre-trained backbones of
foundation models while effectively incorporating exogenous covariates from
various modalities, including time series, language, and images, to improve the
quality of predictions. Technically, CoRA maintains the equivalence of
initialization and parameter consistency during adaptation. With preserved
backbones of foundation models as frozen feature extractors, the outcome
embeddings from foundation models are empirically demonstrated more informative
than raw data. Further, CoRA employs a novel Granger Causality Embedding (GCE)
to automatically evaluate covariates regarding their causal predictability with
respect to the target variate. We incorporate these weighted embeddings with a
zero-initialized condition-injection mechanism, avoiding catastrophic
forgetting of pre-trained foundation models and gradually integrates exogenous
information. Extensive experiments show that CoRA of TSFMs surpasses
state-of-the-art covariate-aware deep forecasters with full or few-shot
training samples, achieving 31.1% MSE reduction on covariate-aware forecasting.
Compared to other adaptation methods, CoRA exhibits strong compatibility with
various advanced TSFMs and extends the scope of covariates to other modalities,
presenting a practical paradigm for the application of TSFMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城际客车异常停靠检测对乘客安全和运营可靠性至关重要，但面临GPS轨迹稀疏和标注数据有限两大挑战，现有方法假设密集采样或规则运动模式，适用性受限。

Method: 1. 稀疏感知分段(SAS)基于局部时空密度定义段边界；2. 三个领域特定指标捕获异常停靠行为；3. 局部时间指标引导调整(LTIGA)通过局部相似图平滑指标；4. 构建时空图，应用标签传播和GCN学习关系模式；5. 自训练模块集成高置信度伪标签迭代改进预测。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了GPS轨迹稀疏和标注数据有限的问题，在城际客车异常停靠检测中表现出色，代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: Abnormal stop detection (ASD) in intercity coach transportation is critical
for ensuring passenger safety, operational reliability, and regulatory
compliance. However, two key challenges hinder ASD effectiveness: sparse GPS
trajectories, which obscure short or unauthorized stops, and limited labeled
data, which restricts supervised learning. Existing methods often assume dense
sampling or regular movement patterns, limiting their applicability. To address
data sparsity, we propose a Sparsity-Aware Segmentation (SAS) method that
adaptively defines segment boundaries based on local spatial-temporal density.
Building upon these segments, we introduce three domain-specific indicators to
capture abnormal stop behaviors. To further mitigate the impact of sparsity, we
develop Locally Temporal-Indicator Guided Adjustment (LTIGA), which smooths
these indicators via local similarity graphs. To overcome label scarcity, we
construct a spatial-temporal graph where each segment is a node with
LTIGA-refined features. We apply label propagation to expand weak supervision
across the graph, followed by a GCN to learn relational patterns. A final
self-training module incorporates high-confidence pseudo-labels to iteratively
improve predictions. Experiments on real-world coach data show an AUC of 0.854
and AP of 0.866 using only 10 labeled instances, outperforming prior methods.

Conclusion: DiffEM方法能够有效地从损坏数据中训练扩散模型，为高维逆问题提供了实用的解决方案

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative priors for
high-dimensional inverse problems, yet learning them when only corrupted or
noisy observations are available remains challenging. In this work, we propose
a new method for training diffusion models with Expectation-Maximization (EM)
from corrupted data. Our proposed method, DiffEM, utilizes conditional
diffusion models to reconstruct clean data from observations in the E-step, and
then uses the reconstructed data to refine the conditional diffusion model in
the M-step. Theoretically, we provide monotonic convergence guarantees for the
DiffEM iteration, assuming appropriate statistical conditions. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on various image
reconstruction tasks.

space induced by the network. Mainly, we investigate how the Fiedler partition
of the dual graph and show that it appears to correlate with the decision
boundary -- in the case of binary classification. Additionally, we compute the
homology of the cellular decomposition -- in a regression task -- to draw
similar patterns in behavior between the training loss and polyhedral
cell-count, as the model is trained.

Abstract: Chemical pretrained models, sometimes referred to as foundation models, are
receiving considerable interest for drug discovery applications. The general
chemical knowledge extracted from self-supervised training has the potential to
improve predictions for critical drug discovery endpoints, including on-target
potency and ADMET properties. Multi-task learning has previously been
successfully leveraged to improve predictive models. Here, we show that
enabling multitasking in finetuning of chemical pretrained graph neural network
models such as Kinetic GROVER Multi-Task (KERMT), an enhanced version of the
GROVER model, and Knowledge-guided Pre-training of Graph Transformer (KGPT)
significantly improves performance over non-pretrained graph neural network
models. Surprisingly, we find that the performance improvement from finetuning
KERMT in a multitask manner is most significant at larger data sizes.
Additionally, we publish two multitask ADMET data splits to enable more
accurate benchmarking of multitask deep learning methods for drug property
prediction. Finally, we provide an accelerated implementation of the KERMT
model on GitHub, unlocking large-scale pretraining, finetuning, and inference
in industrial drug discovery workflows.

TL;DR: CARVQ是一种结合校正适配器和分组残差向量量化的后训练压缩方法，可将LLM嵌入层压缩至约1.6比特，降低内存占用并加速推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的嵌入层参数众多，导致存储需求大和内存占用高，特别是在边缘设备上，压缩嵌入层可以释放内存带宽并加速推理。

Method: 使用校正适配器结合分组残差向量量化，通过线性和非线性映射的组合来模拟原始模型嵌入，无需专用硬件支持低位存储。

Result: 在多个预训练LLM上测试，CARVQ在大多数情况下能实现更低的平均比特宽度，同时保持合理的困惑度和准确性，相比标量化方法表现更好。

Conclusion: CARVQ是一种与最先进变换器量化方法兼容的压缩技术，可在支持4位内存的任何硬件上无缝集成，是实现LLM在边缘设备高效部署的关键步骤。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) typically rely on a large number of parameters
for token embedding, leading to substantial storage requirements and memory
footprints. In particular, LLMs deployed on edge devices are memory-bound, and
reducing the memory footprint by compressing the embedding layer not only frees
up the memory bandwidth but also speeds up inference. To address this, we
introduce CARVQ, a post-training novel Corrective Adaptor combined with group
Residual Vector Quantization. CARVQ relies on the composition of both linear
and non-linear maps and mimics the original model embedding to compress to
approximately 1.6 bits without requiring specialized hardware to support
lower-bit storage. We test our method on pre-trained LLMs such as LLaMA-3.2-1B,
LLaMA-3.2-3B, LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct, LLaMA-3.1-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, Qwen2.5-Math-7B
and Phi-4, evaluating on common generative, discriminative, math and reasoning
tasks. We show that in most cases, CARVQ can achieve lower average
bitwidth-per-parameter while maintaining reasonable perplexity and accuracy
compared to scalar quantization. Our contributions include a novel compression
technique that is compatible with state-of-the-art transformer quantization
methods and can be seamlessly integrated into any hardware supporting 4-bit
memory to reduce the model's memory footprint in memory-constrained devices.
This work demonstrates a crucial step toward the efficient deployment of LLMs
on edge devices.

Motivation: 研究决策树学习中常见的局部搜索操作（调整切割阈值和交换特征）的复杂性，旨在理解这些操作的难易程度及其可处理性条件。

Method: 使用参数化复杂性分析，考虑特征数量d和域大小D等参数，开发了时间复杂度为(D+1)^(2d)·|I|^O(1)的算法，并进行了概念验证实现和实证评估。

Result: 发现这些问题在一般情况下是NP完全的，但当特征数量d和域大小D都很小时，问题变得固定参数可解。算法实现验证了理论分析的有效性。

Conclusion: 决策树的局部优化操作在组合条件下是可处理的，参数化复杂性分析为理解这些操作的难易程度提供了理论框架。

Abstract: Algorithms for learning decision trees often include heuristic local-search
operations such as (1) adjusting the threshold of a cut or (2) also exchanging
the feature of that cut. We study minimizing the number of classification
errors by performing a fixed number of a single type of these operations.
Although we discover that the corresponding problems are NP-complete in
general, we provide a comprehensive parameterized-complexity analysis with the
aim of determining those properties of the problems that explain the hardness
and those that make the problems tractable. For instance, we show that the
problems remain hard for a small number $d$ of features or small domain size
$D$ but the combination of both yields fixed-parameter tractability. That is,
the problems are solvable in $(D + 1)^{2d} \cdot |I|^{O(1)}$ time, where $|I|$
is the size of the input. We also provide a proof-of-concept implementation of
this algorithm and report on empirical results.

Abstract: In this paper, we presents a novel hierarchical federated learning
architecture specifically designed for smart agricultural production systems
and crop yield prediction. Our approach introduces a seasonal subscription
mechanism where farms join crop-specific clusters at the beginning of each
agricultural season. The proposed three-layer architecture consists of
individual smart farms at the client level, crop-specific aggregators at the
middle layer, and a global model aggregator at the top level. Within each crop
cluster, clients collaboratively train specialized models tailored to specific
crop types, which are then aggregated to produce a higher-level global model
that integrates knowledge across multiple crops. This hierarchical design
enables both local specialization for individual crop types and global
generalization across diverse agricultural contexts while preserving data
privacy and reducing communication overhead. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed system, showing that local and crop-layer models
closely follow actual yield patterns with consistent alignment, significantly
outperforming standard machine learning models. The results validate the
advantages of hierarchical federated learning in the agricultural context,
particularly for scenarios involving heterogeneous farming environments and
privacy-sensitive agricultural data.

Motivation: 传统的变量重要性方法依赖于单一模型和观测到的特征，但变量重要性受其他包含变量的影响，且观测数据中常遗漏关键变量。此外，不同同等性能模型可能给出不同的变量重要性估计（Rashomon效应）。

Method: 引入UNIVERSE方法，通过适应Rashomon集合（数据集中近似最优模型的集合），即使在存在缺失特征的情况下也能产生真实变量重要性的边界。

Conclusion: UNIVERSE方法解决了传统变量重要性估计的局限性，通过考虑模型不确定性和未观测变量，提供了更可靠的变量重要性边界估计。

Abstract: Variable importance (VI) methods are often used for hypothesis generation,
feature selection, and scientific validation. In the standard VI pipeline, an
analyst estimates VI for a single predictive model with only the observed
features. However, the importance of a feature depends heavily on which other
variables are included in the model, and essential variables are often omitted
from observational datasets. Moreover, the VI estimated for one model is often
not the same as the VI estimated for another equally-good model - a phenomenon
known as the Rashomon Effect. We address these gaps by introducing
UNobservables and Inference for Variable importancE using Rashomon SEts
(UNIVERSE). Our approach adapts Rashomon sets - the sets of near-optimal models
in a dataset - to produce bounds on the true VI even with missing features. We
theoretically guarantee the robustness of our approach, show strong performance
on semi-synthetic simulations, and demonstrate its utility in a credit risk
task.

<details>

Motivation: 深度神经网络极易受到对抗攻击，这对安全和关键应用构成重大风险，需要开发轻量级、即插即用的检测解决方案。

Conclusion: KoALA是一种轻量级、即插即用的对抗检测解决方案，适用于现有模型和各种数据模态，无需架构修改或对抗训练。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks, which
pose significant risks to security- and safety-critical applications. We
present KoALA (KL-L0 Adversarial detection via Label Agreement), a novel,
semantics-free adversarial detector that requires no architectural changes or
adversarial retraining. KoALA operates on a simple principle: it detects an
adversarial attack when class predictions from two complementary similarity
metrics disagree. These metrics-KL divergence and an L0-based similarity-are
specifically chosen to detect different types of perturbations. The KL
divergence metric is sensitive to dense, low-amplitude shifts, while the
L0-based similarity is designed for sparse, high-impact changes. We provide a
formal proof of correctness for our approach. The only training required is a
simple fine-tuning step on a pre-trained image encoder using clean images to
ensure the embeddings align well with both metrics. This makes KOALA a
lightweight, plug-and-play solution for existing models and various data
modalities. Our extensive experiments on ResNet/CIFAR-10 and CLIP/Tiny-ImageNet
confirm our theoretical claims. When the theorem's conditions are met, KoALA
consistently and effectively detects adversarial examples. On the full test
sets, KoALA achieves a precision of 0.94 and a recall of 0.81 on
ResNet/CIFAR-10, and a precision of 0.66 and a recall of 0.85 on
CLIP/Tiny-ImageNet.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决为多个决策者构建单一预测器的问题，该预测器需要同时最小化多个损失函数，这在传统单决策者设置中相当于最小化适当的损失函数，但在多决策者场景下变为一种omniprediction问题。

Method: 分析了两种现有方法：1）基于多校准的boosting方法，2）基于对抗性博弈的在线方法。提出了一种新的非随机化算法，利用适当损失函数集的结构特性来更直接地解决问题。

Result: 证明了多校准问题比omniprediction问题更难，因此基于多校准的方法会带来次优的样本复杂度。通过在线到批处理的转换可以获得样本高效的算法，但会产生复杂的随机化预测器。提出的新方法改进了这一点。

Conclusion: 开发了一种更直接、非随机化的算法来解决omniprediction问题，该算法通过利用适当损失函数集的结构特性，克服了现有方法的局限性，提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: We consider the problem of constructing probabilistic predictions that lead
to accurate decisions when employed by downstream users to inform actions. For
a single decision maker, designing an optimal predictor is equivalent to
minimizing a proper loss function corresponding to the negative utility of that
individual. For multiple decision makers, our problem can be viewed as a
variant of omniprediction in which the goal is to design a single predictor
that simultaneously minimizes multiple losses. Existing algorithms for
achieving omniprediction broadly fall into two categories: 1) boosting methods
that optimize other auxiliary targets such as multicalibration and obtain
omniprediction as a corollary, and 2) adversarial two-player game based
approaches that estimate and respond to the ``worst-case" loss in an online
fashion. We give lower bounds demonstrating that multicalibration is a strictly
more difficult problem than omniprediction and thus the former approach must
incur suboptimal sample complexity. For the latter approach, we discuss how
these ideas can be used to obtain a sample-efficient algorithm through an
online-to-batch conversion. This conversion has the downside of returning a
complex, randomized predictor. We improve on this method by designing a more
direct, unrandomized algorithm that exploits structural elements of the set of
proper losses.

transformers that demonstrate promising performance on event-based vision
tasks. However, despite these empirical successes, there remains limited
understanding of how spiking transformers fundamentally process event-based
data. Current approaches primarily focus on architectural modifications without
analyzing the underlying signal processing characteristics. In this work, we
analyze spiking transformers through the frequency spectrum domain and discover
that they behave as high-pass filters, contrasting with Vision Transformers
(ViTs) that act as low-pass filters. This frequency domain analysis reveals why
certain designs work well for event-based data, which contains valuable
high-frequency information but is also sparse and noisy. Based on this
observation, we propose SpikePool, which replaces spike-based self-attention
with max pooling attention, a low-pass filtering operation, to create a
selective band-pass filtering effect. This design preserves meaningful
high-frequency content while capturing critical features and suppressing noise,
achieving a better balance for event-based data processing. Our approach
demonstrates competitive results on event-based datasets for both
classification and object detection tasks while significantly reducing training
and inference time by up to 42.5% and 32.8%, respectively.

### [180] [Rationally Analyzing Shelby: Proving Incentive Compatibility in a Decentralized Storage Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11866)
*Michael Crystal,Guy Goren,Scott Duke Kominers*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文对Shelby存储网络协议进行了首次形式化激励分析，证明其结合链下审计和偶尔链上验证的设计在自然参数设置下具有激励兼容性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管去中心化存储是区块链和Web3生态的核心应用，但大多数存储协议的激励属性缺乏形式化分析。激励设计不当可能导致系统无法真正去中心化存储。

Method: 使用博弈论模型分析Shelby协议，研究链下审计、链上验证的组合效果，并考察联盟行为。

Result: 仅靠链下审计会导致普遍逃避责任，但Shelby结合同行审计和偶尔链上验证的设计在自然参数下实现激励兼容。还提出了增强抗合谋性的简单修改方案。

Conclusion: Shelby协议通过精心设计的审计机制实现了激励兼容，为去中心化存储系统的激励设计提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Decentralized storage is one of the most natural applications built on
blockchains and a central component of the Web3 ecosystem. Yet despite a decade
of active development -- from IPFS and Filecoin to more recent entrants -- most
of these storage protocols have received limited formal analysis of their
incentive properties. Claims of incentive compatibility are sometimes made, but
rarely proven. This gap matters: without well-designed incentives, a system may
distribute storage but fail to truly decentralize it.
  We analyze Shelby -- a storage network protocol recently proposed by Aptos
Labs and Jump Crypto -- and provide the first formal proof of its incentive
properties. Our game-theoretic model shows that while off-chain audits alone
collapse to universal shirking, Shelby's combination of peer audits with
occasional on-chain verification yields incentive compatibility under natural
parameter settings. We also examine coalition behavior and outline a simple
modification that strengthens the protocol's collusion-resilience.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文研究了不可分割物品的公平分配问题，包括一般模型和图形模型。主要贡献包括：证明了当物品数量不超过n+5时混合物品的MMS分配存在性；证明了判断多图中是否存在EFX分配是NP完全问题；给出了判断图中是否存在EF1和EFX分配的多项式时间算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不可分割物品的公平分配问题，旨在满足MMS、EF1、EFX等公平标准。特别关注图形模型，其中物品表示为边，代理表示为顶点，这种模型在现实应用中具有实际意义。

Method: 采用理论分析和算法设计的方法。对于一般模型，使用组合数学和公平分配理论；对于图形模型，使用图论方法和计算复杂性分析，包括NP完全性证明和多项式时间算法设计。

Result: 1) 当m≤n+5时，混合物品的MMS分配存在，除非所有代理的MMS阈值都为负；2) 判断多图中是否存在EFX分配是NP完全问题；3) 对于图形模型中的杂务分配，存在判断EF1和EFX分配的多项式时间算法。

Conclusion: 本文在公平分配领域取得了重要进展，揭示了混合物品MMS分配的存在条件，证明了多图EFX分配的NP完全性，并发现了杂务分配与物品分配在计算复杂性上的根本差异。

Abstract: We study the fair division of indivisible items. In the general model, the
goal is to allocate $m$ indivisible items to $n$ agents while satisfying
fairness criteria such as MMS, EF1, and EFX. We also study a
recently-introduced graphical model that represents the fair division problem
as a multigraph, in which vertices correspond to agents and edges to items. The
graphical model stipulates that an item can have non-zero marginal utility to
an agent only if its corresponding edge is incident to the agent's
corresponding vertex. We study orientations (allocations that allocate each
edge to an endpoint) in this model, as they are particularly desirable.
  Our first contribution concerns MMS allocations of mixed manna (i.e. a
mixture of goods and chores) in the general model. It is known that MMS
allocations of goods exist when $m \leq n+5$. We generalize this and show that
when $m \leq n+5$, MMS allocations of mixed manna exist as long as $n \leq 3$,
there is an agent whose MMS threshold is non-negative, or every item is a
chore. Remarkably, our result leaves only the case where every agent has a
negative MMS threshold unanswered.
  Our second contribution concerns EFX orientations of multigraphs of goods. We
show that deciding whether EFX orientations exist for multigraphs is
NP-complete, even for symmetric bi-valued multigraphs. Complementarily, we show
symmetric bi-valued multigraphs that do not contain non-trivial odd multitrees
have EFX orientations that can be found in polynomial time.
  Our third contribution concerns EF1 and EFX orientations of graphs and
multigraphs of chores. We obtain polynomial-time algorithms for deciding
whether such graphs have EF1 and EFX orientations, resolving a previous
conjecture and showing a fundamental difference between goods and chores
division. In addition, we show that the analogous problems for multigraphs are
NP-hard.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在联盟规模受到固定上下界限制的可加可分联盟博弈中，不同稳定性概念下稳定结果的存在性问题，填补了该领域的研究空白。

Method: 考虑了四种经典稳定性概念（纳什稳定性、个体稳定性、契约纳什稳定性、契约个体稳定性）及其两个变体，分析在不同规模参数下稳定结果的存在性，并对仅有上界约束的情况进行了计算复杂性分析。

Result: 提供了关于给定规模参数下稳定结果存在性的完整图景，获得了契约个体稳定性和契约纳什稳定性的多项式时间算法（后者要求上界为2），并在下界至少为2时获得了纳什稳定性和契约个体稳定性的进一步结果。

Conclusion: 该研究为具有规模限制的联盟博弈稳定性分析提供了系统的理论框架和算法结果，揭示了不同稳定性概念在规模约束下的计算特性和存在条件。

Abstract: We study stability in additively separable hedonic games when coalition sizes
have to respect fixed size bounds. We consider four classic notions of
stability based on single-agent deviations, namely, Nash stability, individual
stability, contractual Nash stability, and contractual individual stability.
For each stability notion, we consider two variants: in one, the coalition left
behind by a deviator must still be of a valid size, and in the other there is
no such constraint. We provide a full picture of the existence of stable
outcomes with respect to given size parameters. Additionally, when there are
only upper bounds, we fully characterize the computational complexity of the
associated existence problem. In particular, we obtain polynomial-time
algorithms for contractual individual stability and contractual Nash stability,
where the latter requires an upper bound of 2. We obtain further results for
Nash stability and contractual individual stability, when the lower bound is at
least 2.

Conclusion: 量子欺骗框架成功扩展了经典欺骗概念，量子特性可以放大欺骗的影响，为量子博弈理论提供了新的分析工具。

Abstract: In this paper, we develop a framework for deception in quantum games,
extending the Honey-X paradigm from classical zero-sum settings into the
quantum domain. Building on a view of deception in classical games as
manipulation of a player's perception of the payoff matrix, we formalize
quantum deception as controlled perturbations of the payoff Hamiltonian subject
to a deception budget. We show that when victims are aware of possible
deception, their equilibrium strategies surprisingly coincide with those of
naive victims who fully trust the deceptive Hamiltonian. This equivalence
allows us to cast quantum deception as a bilevel optimization problem, which
can be reformulated into a bilinear semidefinite program. To illustrate the
framework, we present simulations on quantum versions of the Penny Flip game,
demonstrating how quantum strategy spaces and non-classical payoffs can amplify
the impact of deception relative to classical formulations.

Abstract: The most startling of the contemporary problems is the sleepiness of
chauffeur which causes lots of car accidents. Prevention of those impending
accidents by detecting and alerting the sleepy chauffeur is vital, otherwise
that would lead to loss of lives and various traumas along with severe
injuries. The slumber or sleep may be caused by huge stress, pressure,
relentless work load or alcoholism, for which sleep deprivation occurs and the
chauffeur while driving gets drowsy. So far, considerable amount of systems has
been developed to detect drowsiness of drivers, most of which mainly depend on
image processing algorithms using cameras. Some of them also incorporate
artificial intelligence and machine learning based algorithms. This paper
presents a review of the existing systems and also proposes an easy and cheap
system using sensors and Arduino, capable of detecting sleepiness and generates
siren alarm and send alert message to take precautionary measures.

Abstract: Since the 1990s, widespread introduction of central (wholesale) electricity
markets has been seen across multiple continents, driven by the search for
efficient operation of the power grid through competition. The increase of
renewables has made significant impacts both on central electricity markets and
distribution-level grids as renewable power generation is often connected to
the latter. These stochastic renewable technologies have both advantages and
disadvantages. On one hand they offer very low marginal cost and carbon
emissions, while on the other hand, their output is uncertain, requiring
flexible backup power with high marginal cost. Flexibility from end-prosumers
or smaller market participants is therefore seen as a key enabler of
large-scale integration of renewables. However, current central electricity
markets do not directly include uncertainty into the market clearing and do not
account for physical constraints of distribution grids. In this paper we
propose a local electricity market framework based on probabilistic locational
marginal pricing, effectively accounting for uncertainties in production,
consumption and grid variables. The model includes a representation of the grid
using the lindistflow equations and accounts for the propagation of uncertainty
using general Polynomial Chaos (gPC). A two-stage convex model is proposed; in
the day-ahead stage, probability distributions of prices are calculated for
every timestep, where the expected values represent the day-ahead (spot)
prices. In the real-time stage, uncertainties are realized (measured) and a
trivial calculation reveals the real-time price. Through four instructive
case-studies we highlight the effectiveness of the method to incentivize
end-prosumers' participation in the market, while ensuring that their behavior
does not have an adverse impact on the operation of the grid.

Conclusion: PI-TD3算法实现了鲁棒、可扩展且实用的电动汽车充电策略，增强了电网韧性并支持配电网运行。

Abstract: Electric Vehicles (EVs) offer substantial flexibility for grid services, yet
large-scale, uncoordinated charging can threaten voltage stability in
distribution networks. Existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches for
smart charging often disregard physical grid constraints or have limited
performance for complex large-scale tasks, limiting their scalability and
real-world applicability. This paper introduces a physics-informed (PI) RL
algorithm that integrates a differentiable power flow model and voltage-based
reward design into the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3)
algorithm, enabling EVs to deliver real-time voltage support while meeting user
demands. The resulting PI-TD3 algorithm achieves faster convergence, improved
sample efficiency, and reliable voltage magnitude regulation under uncertain
and overloaded conditions. Benchmarks on the IEEE 34-bus and 123-bus networks
show that the proposed PI-TD3 outperforms both model-free RL and
optimization-based baselines in grid constraint management, user satisfaction,
and economic metrics, even as the system scales to hundreds of EVs. These
advances enable robust, scalable, and practical EV charging strategies that
enhance grid resilience and support distribution networks operation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有识别方法面临显著权衡：被动方法依赖环境谐波和罕见电网事件，只能在少数频率提供估计；主动方法需要长时间测量和专用设备。时间域主动方法虽减少测量时间，但需要简化假设或繁琐的模型阶数调整。

Method: 非参数频域方法，无需专用激励信号或硬件，实现超快速识别，对电网结构不作假设。

Result: 通过详细电磁暂态仿真验证了该方法，并证明其相对于现有替代方案的明显优越性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了现有挑战，实现了超快速电网阻抗识别，大幅减少了测量时间。

Abstract: We propose a non-parametric frequency-domain method to identify small-signal
$dq$-asymmetric grid impedances, over a wide frequency band, using
grid-connected converters. Existing identification methods are faced with
significant trade-offs: e.g., passive approaches rely on ambient harmonics and
rare grid events and thus can only provide estimates at a few frequencies,
while many active approaches that intentionally perturb grid operation require
long time series measurement and specialized equipment. Although active
time-domain methods reduce the measurement time, they either make crude
simplifying assumptions or require laborious model order tuning. Our approach
effectively addresses these challenges: it does not require specialized
excitation signals or hardware and achieves ultrafast ($<1$ s) identification,
drastically reducing measurement time. Being non-parametric, our approach also
makes no assumptions on the grid structure. A detailed electromagnetic
transient simulation is used to validate the method and demonstrate its clear
superiority over existing alternatives.

Abstract: This paper proposes a unidirectionally connected fully actuated system

By eliminating estimation of the high-order derivatives of control inputs, a
drawback of current methods, the UC-FAS model simplifies controller design and
enables direct eigenstructure assignment for closed-loop dynamics. Simulations
demonstrate precise 6-DOF tracking performance. This work bridges theoretical
FAS approach advancements with practical implementation needs, offering a

Abstract: Wind power producers can benefit from forming coalitions to participate
cooperatively in electricity markets. To support such collaboration, various
profit allocation rules rooted in cooperative game theory have been proposed.
However, existing approaches overlook the lack of coherence among producers
regarding forecast information, which may lead to ambiguity in offering and
allocations. In this paper, we introduce a ``reconcile-then-optimize''
framework for cooperative market offerings. This framework first aligns the
individual forecasts into a coherent joint forecast before determining market
offers. With such forecasts, we formulate and solve a two-stage stochastic
programming problem to derive both the aggregate offer and the corresponding
scenario-based dual values for each trading hour. Based on these dual values,
we construct a profit allocation rule that is budget-balanced and stable.
Finally, we validate the proposed method through empirical case studies,
demonstrating its practical effectiveness and theoretical soundness.

Abstract: Combinatorial Optimization (CO) problems exhibit exponential complexity,
making their resolution challenging. Simulated Adiabatic Bifurcation (aSB) is a
quantum-inspired algorithm to obtain approximate solutions to largescale CO
problems written in the Ising form. It explores the solution space by emulating
the adiabatic evolution of a network of Kerr-nonlinear parametric oscillators
(KPOs), where each oscillator represents a variable in the problem. The optimal
solution corresponds to the ground state of this system. A key advantage of
this approach is the possibility of updating multiple variables simultaneously,
making it particularly suited for hardware implementation. To enhance solution
quality and convergence speed, variations of the algorithm have been proposed
in the literature, including ballistic (bSB), discrete (dSB), and thermal
(HbSB) versions. In this work, we have comprehensively analyzed dSB, bSB, and
HbSB using dedicated software models, evaluating the feasibility of using a
fixed-point representation for hardware implementation. We then present an
opensource hardware architecture implementing the dSB algorithm for
Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). The design allows users to adjust the
degree of algorithmic parallelization based on their specific requirements. A
proof-of-concept implementation that solves 256-variable problems was achieved
on an AMD Kria KV260 SoM, a low-tier FPGA, validated using well-known max-cut
and knapsack problems.

Abstract: Connected braking can reduce fatal collisions in connected and autonomous
vehicles (CAVs) by using reliable, low-latency 5G New Radio (NR) links,
especially NR Sidelink Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X). In rural areas, road side
units are sparse and power-constrained or off-grid, so energy efficiency must
be considered alongside safety. This paper studies how three communication
control factors including subcarrier spacing ($\mathrm{SCS}$), modulation and
coding scheme ($\mathrm{MCS}$), and transmit power ($P_{\mathrm{t}}$) should be
configured to balance safety and energy consumption in rural line-of-sight
(LOS) scenarios in light and heavy traffic scenarios. Safety is quantified by
the packet receive ratio ($\mathrm{PRR}$) against the minimum communication
distance $D_{\mathrm{comm}}$, defined as the distance that the vehicle travels
during the transmission of the safety message. Results show that, under heavy
traffic, increasing $P_{\mathrm{t}}$ and selecting a low-rate $\mathrm{MCS}$ at
$\mathrm{SCS} = 30$ kHz sustains high $\mathrm{PRR}$ at $D_{\mathrm{comm}}$,
albeit with higher energy cost. In light traffic, maintaining lower
$P_\mathrm{t}$ with low $\mathrm{MCS}$ levels achieves a favorable
reliability-energy trade-off while preserving acceptable $\mathrm{PRR}$ at
$D_{\mathrm{comm}}$. These findings demonstrate the necessity of adaptive,
energy-aware strategy to guarantee both safety and energy efficiency in rural
V2X systems.

Conclusion: 该算法成功实现了隐私保护、通信成本降低和估计性能的平衡，通过量化器实现了隐私保护的乘法效应改进，为隐私保护分布式估计提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper focuses on the privacy-preserving distributed estimation problem
with a limited data rate, where the observations are the sensitive information.
Specifically, a binary-valued quantizer-based privacy-preserving distributed
estimation algorithm is developed, which improves the algorithm's
privacy-preserving capability and simultaneously reduces the communication
costs. The algorithm's privacy-preserving capability, measured by the Fisher
information matrix, is dynamically enhanced over time. Notably, the Fisher
information matrix of the output signals with respect to the sensitive
information converges to zero at a polynomial rate, and the improvement in
privacy brought by the quantizers is quantitatively characterized as a
multiplicative effect. Regarding the communication costs, each sensor transmits
only 1 bit of information to its neighbours at each time step. Additionally,
the assumption on the negligible quantization error for real-valued messages is
not required. While achieving the requirements of privacy preservation and
reducing communication costs, the algorithm ensures that its estimates converge
almost surely to the true value of the unknown parameter by establishing a
co-design guideline for the time-varying privacy noises and step-sizes. A
polynomial almost sure convergence rate is obtained, and then the trade-off
between privacy and convergence rate is established. Numerical examples
demonstrate the main results.

Result: 对西班牙南部RVPP的仿真表明，战略决策和灵活资源的可用性显著影响其可行性、市场参与度和机组调度。

Conclusion: 灵活资源对RVPP的市场参与和盈利能力具有重要影响，通过合理的利润分配机制可以确保各技术根据其在能源和备用供应中的实际作用获得公平回报。

Abstract: In the transition toward a sustainable power system, renewable-based Virtual
Power Plants (RVPPs) have emerged as a promising solution to the challenges of
integrating renewable energy sources into electricity markets. Their viability,
however, depends on effective market participation strategies and the ability
to manage uncertainties while leveraging flexible resources. This paper
analyzes the impact of different flexible resources - such as concentrated
solar power plants, hydro plants, biomass plants, and flexible demand - on the
participation of RVPPs in energy and reserve markets. Multiple sources of
uncertainty in generation, consumption, and electricity prices are addressed
using a two-stage robust optimization approach. The contribution of different
technologies to RVPP profitability is evaluated through a marginal contribution
method, ensuring fair allocation of profits among them according to their
actual role in energy and reserve provision across markets. Simulations for an
RVPP in southern Spain demonstrate how strategic decisions and the availability
of flexible resources influence viability, market participation, and unit
scheduling.

TL;DR: MindfulVerse是一个基于AIGC的个性化冥想应用，通过AI代理动态调整冥想内容，在VR环境中提供沉浸式体验，改善用户自我调节神经激活和情绪调节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有标准化冥想应用无法满足不同心理状态和健康状况用户的个性化需求，缺乏自适应内容设计。

Method: 开发MindfulVerse应用，采用AIGC驱动的AI代理动态生成个性化冥想内容，在VR环境中进行探索性用户研究和比较评估。

Result: 生成式冥想改善了自我调节的神经激活，对情绪调节和参与度产生积极影响。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种生成式冥想流程，能够更好地适应用户偏好和状态。

Abstract: Mindfulness meditation has seen increasing applications in diverse domains as
an effective practice to improve mental health. However, the standardized
frameworks adopted by most applications often fail to cater to users with
various psychological states and health conditions. This limitation arises
primarily from the lack of personalization and adaptive content design. To
address this, we propose MindfulVerse, an AI-Generated Content (AIGC)-driven
application to create personalized and immersive mindfulness experiences. By
developing a novel agent, the system can dynamically adjust the meditation
content based on the ideas of individual users. Furthermore, we conducted
exploratory user studies and comparative evaluations to assess the application
scenarios and performance of our novel generative meditation tool in VR
environments. The results of this user study indicate that generative
meditation improves neural activation in self-regulation and shows a positive
impact on emotional regulation and participation. Our approach offers a
generative meditation procedure that provides users with an application that
better suits their preferences and states.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 比较三种替代可视化方法（聚合、网格、螺旋线图）与标准线图在时间数据趋势识别、预测和决策任务中的表现，发现聚合图表表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过度绘制的线图会掩盖时间数据中的趋势并阻碍预测，需要寻找更好的可视化方法来处理密集时间数据。

Method: 通过用户研究比较标准线图与三种替代方案（聚合、网格、螺旋线图）在趋势识别、预测和决策任务中的表现，并使用信任游戏评估决策影响。

Result: 聚合图表在趋势识别和预测准确性上与标准图表相当或更好；网格和螺旋图表表现较差；在信任游戏中，对标准和聚合图表信任度相似，对螺旋图表信任度不一，对网格图表倾向于不信任。

Conclusion: 聚合图表是处理密集时间数据的有效可视化策略，为从业者选择可视化方法提供了指导。

Abstract: Overplotted line charts can obscure trends in temporal data and hinder
prediction. We conduct a user study comparing three alternatives-aggregated,
trellis, and spiral line charts against standard line charts on tasks involving
trend identification, making predictions, and decision-making. We found
aggregated charts performed similarly to standard charts and support more
accurate trend recognition and prediction; trellis and spiral charts generally
lag. We also examined the impact on decision-making via a trust game. The
results showed similar trust in standard and aggregated charts, varied trust in
spiral charts, and a lean toward distrust in trellis charts. These findings
provide guidance for practitioners choosing visualization strategies for dense
temporal data.

TL;DR: 本研究比较了内部和外部标注员群体在创建多轮RAG对话标注任务中的反馈循环差异，分析了两种群体在标注质量、数量和多样性方面的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了确保基于大型语言模型的聊天助手能够忠实于现有文本内容而不提供错误信息，需要创建高质量的检索增强生成(RAG)对话标注数据来评估模型性能。

Method: 通过纵向研究比较内部和外部标注员群体在创建多轮RAG对话时的反馈循环，分析他们生成的对话质量，并进行调查问卷比较他们的体验。

Result: 研究发现更紧密的反馈循环能产生更高质量的对话，但会减少标注数量和多样性。两种标注员群体各有优势。

Conclusion: 研究为如何在复杂标注任务中最佳利用两种不同群体提供了指导，强调了根据任务需求平衡标注质量、数量和多样性的重要性。

Abstract: Grounding conversations in existing passages, known as Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG), is an important aspect of Chat-Based Assistants powered by
Large Language Models (LLMs) to ensure they are faithful and don't provide
misinformation. Several benchmarks have been created to measure the performance
of LLMs on this task. We present a longitudinal study comparing the feedback
loop of an internal and external human annotator group for the complex
annotation task of creating multi-turn RAG conversations for evaluating LLMs.
We analyze the conversations produced by both groups and provide results of a
survey comparing their experiences. Our study highlights the advantages of each
annotator population and the impact of the different feedback loops; a closer
loop creates higher quality conversations with a decrease in quantity and
diversity. Further, we present guidance for how to best utilize two different
population groups when performing annotation tasks, particularly when the task
is complex.

TL;DR: 通过视觉速记任务研究人们在绘制折线图时如何优先处理不同视觉特征，发现噪声水平影响人们的绘图策略，揭示了人类对趋势和峰谷特征的忠实保留，以及对周期性和噪声的语义性处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究折线图中哪些视觉特征被读者认为重要并优先保留，特别是在存在视觉噪声的情况下，以了解人类如何感知和总结时间序列数据。

Method: 采用视觉速记任务，让参与者重新绘制折线图，系统性地改变噪声水平（SNR ~5-30 dB），观察视觉杂乱如何影响人们优先考虑的特征。

Result: 识别出三种与噪声相关的绘图策略：复制者、趋势保持者和去噪者；参与者倾向于忠实保留趋势和峰谷特征，而对周期性和噪声采用更定性或手势化的语义表示。

Conclusion: 需要更灵活和以人为本的方式来呈现、总结、预处理或聚类时间序列数据，考虑人类对视觉特征的感知和优先级。

Abstract: Line charts surface many features in time series data, from trends to
periodicity to peaks and valleys. However, not every potentially important
feature in the data may correspond to a visual feature which readers can detect
or prioritize. In this study, we conducted a visual stenography task, where
participants re-drew line charts to solicit information about the visual
features they believed to be important. We systematically varied noise levels
(SNR ~5-30 dB) across line charts to observe how visual clutter influences
which features people prioritize in their sketches. We identified three key
strategies that correlated with the noise present in the stimuli: the
Replicator attempted to retain all major features of the line chart including
noise; the Trend Keeper prioritized trends disregarding periodicity and peaks;
and the De-noiser filtered out noise while preserving other features. Further,
we found that participants tended to faithfully retain trends and peaks and
valleys when these features were present, while periodicity and noise were
represented in more qualitative or gestural ways: semantically rather than
accurately. These results suggest a need to consider more flexible and
human-centric ways of presenting, summarizing, pre-processing, or clustering
time series data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现成服装尺寸固定、无法适应体型变化和时尚趋势的问题，传统修改方法需要缝纫且不可逆

Method: 开发模块化服装系统：包括模块和连接器组件、基于整数线性规划的服装分解方法、支持模块化设计和模拟的数字设计工具

Result: 用户评估表明该方法支持创建多样化服装，并能帮助用户在保持相同构建模块的情况下转换尺寸和风格

Conclusion: 模块化设计方法能够有效支持服装的尺寸调整、风格变换和组件重用，为可持续时尚提供新途径

Abstract: While bodies change over time and trends vary, most store-bought clothing
comes in fixed sizes and styles and fails to adapt to these changes.
Alterations can enable small changes to otherwise static garments, but these
changes often require sewing and are non-reversible. We propose a modular
approach to garment design that considers resizing, restyling, and reuse
earlier in the design process. Our contributions include a compact set of
modules and connectors that form the building blocks of modular garments, a
method to decompose a garment into modules via integer linear programming, and
a digital design tool that supports modular garment design and simulation. Our
user evaluation suggests that our approach to modular design can support the
creation of a wide range of garments and can help users transform them across
sizes and styles while reusing the same building blocks.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: VizCopilot是一个结合可视化技术的企业聊天机器人原型，通过主题建模和文档可视化让用户参与上下文对齐，解决"无关正确"回答的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业聊天机器人在信息合成任务中，当检索的上下文与用户意图不一致时，会产生"无关正确"的回答，缺乏实际价值。

Method: 开发VizCopilot原型，结合主题建模和文档可视化技术，通过设计研究评估可视化在上下文对齐中的作用。

Result: 可视化不仅帮助用户检测和修正错位的上下文，还鼓励他们调整提示策略，使系统从一开始就能检索到更相关的上下文。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了在细读和AI摘要信任方面的验证支持局限性，并提出了可视化增强聊天机器人的未来方向，包括个性化、主动性和可持续的人机协作。

Abstract: Enterprise chatbots show promise in supporting knowledge workers in
information synthesis tasks by retrieving context from large, heterogeneous
databases before generating answers. However, when the retrieved context
misaligns with user intentions, the chatbot often produces "irrelevantly right"
responses that provide little value. In this work, we introduce VizCopilot, a
prototype that incorporates visualization techniques to actively involve
end-users in context alignment. By combining topic modeling with document
visualization, VizCopilot enables human oversight and modification of retrieved
context while keeping cognitive overhead manageable. We used VizCopilot as a
design probe in a Research-through-Design study to evaluate the role of
visualization in context alignment and to surface future design opportunities.
Our findings show that visualization not only helps users detect and correct
misaligned context but also encourages them to adapt their prompting
strategies, enabling the system to retrieve more relevant context from the
outset. At the same time, the study reveals limitations in verification support
regarding close-reading and trust in AI summaries. We outline future directions
for visualization-enhanced chatbots, focusing on personalization, proactivity,
and sustainable human-AI collaboration.

TL;DR: 该论文扩展了块排序问题的功能，引入了可选块的概念，使教师能够创建具有多个正确答案的复杂帕森斯问题，并通过多图结构表示相互排斥的依赖关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了让学生能够处理具有多个有效解决方案的问题，并让教师能够创建更复杂的帕森斯问题，需要扩展块排序问题的功能以支持可选块。

Method: 使用多图结构表示具有多个相互排斥依赖关系的块，然后将多图折叠成多个有向无环图（DAG），以便重用现有的基于DAG的块排序问题评分算法。

Result: 实现了可选块功能，教师已将其整合到课程中，该功能支持在Git工作流、shell命令序列、数学证明和Python编程概念等多个领域创建复杂问题。

Conclusion: 可选块功能成功扩展了块排序问题的能力，使教师能够设计具有多个正确解决方案的复杂问题，增强了学生的学习体验。

Abstract: This paper extends the functionality of block ordering problems (such as
Parsons problems and Proof Blocks) to include optional blocks. We detail the
algorithms used to implement the optional block feature and present usage
experiences from instructors who have integrated it into their curriculum. The
optional blocks feature enables instructors to create more complex Parsons
problems with multiple correct solutions utilizing omitted or optional blocks.
This affords students a method to engage with questions that have several valid
solutions composed of different answer components. Instructors can specify
blocks with multiple mutually exclusive dependencies, which we represent using
a multigraph structure. This multigraph is then collapsed into multiple
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), allowing us to reuse existing algorithms for
grading block ordering problems represented as a DAG. We present potential use
cases for this feature across various domains, including helping students learn
Git workflows, shell command sequences, mathematical proofs, and Python
programming concepts.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本研究比较了在增强现实中模拟真实社交环境与抽象环境对心理健康技能转移的影响，发现在真实情境中练习的参与者更可能在现实任务中应用自我护理技巧并实现更大的生理压力减轻。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管VR/AR在心理健康领域的应用日益增多，但现有沉浸式干预主要关注平静或抽象环境，缺乏对真实社交模拟如何支持技能向现实环境转移的研究。

Method: 进行了为期14天的用户研究，43名参与者被分为两组：一组使用模拟真实环境的增强现实干预，另一组使用匹配的非情境控制条件，应用于公开演讲情境。

Result: 在真实情境环境中练习心理健康技能的参与者，在模拟现实任务中应用自我护理技巧的可能性显著更高，并且表现出更大的生理压力减轻。

Conclusion: 研究为真实压力源模拟的效果提供了实证证据，并为支持技能有效转移到现实世界的心理健康技术提供了设计启示。

Abstract: Despite growing interest in virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) for mental
well-being, prior work using immersive interventions to teach mental health
skills has largely focused on calming or abstract settings. As a result, little
is known about how realistic social simulation may better support the transfer
and application of skills to in-person environments. In this work, we present a
14-day user study with 43-participants comparing an augmented reality
intervention simulating a realistic contextual environment against a matched
non-contextual control, applied to the public speaking context. We found that
participants who practice mental health skills in the contextual environment
showed significantly greater likelihood to apply self-care techniques and
greater physiological stress reduction when using skills in mock in-person
tasks. Overall, our work provides empirical evidence for the effects of
realistic stressor simulation, and offers design implications for mental health
technology that supports effective transfer of skills to the real-world.

TL;DR: 提出了生成式时间线的概念，这是一种AI驱动的时间线，能够根据用户问题动态扩展或收缩，并通过KnowledgeTrail系统实现，支持用户共同构建历史事件和知识形成过程的时间线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前交互系统正向动态生成体验发展，但时间线作为表示历史和概念发展的基本工具仍然静态，限制了用户能动性和好奇心。

Method: 引入生成式时间线概念，并通过KnowledgeTrail系统实例化，该系统使用AI技术让时间线能够响应用户输入进行动态调整。

Result: 两项用户研究表明，KnowledgeTrail能够促进好奇心驱动的探索、偶然发现以及追溯思想和事件间复杂关系的能力，但引用功能显示信任易受来源可信度感知影响。

Conclusion: 贡献了生成式时间线作为新型探索界面的愿景，并提供了平衡偶然性和可信度的设计见解。

Abstract: The landscape of interactive systems is shifting toward dynamic, generative
experiences that empower users to explore and construct knowledge in real time.
Yet, timelines -- a fundamental tool for representing historical and conceptual
development -- remain largely static, limiting user agency and curiosity. We
introduce the concept of a generative timeline: an AI-powered timeline that
adapts to users' evolving questions by expanding or contracting in response to
input. We instantiate this concept through KnowledgeTrail, a system that
enables users to co-construct timelines of historical events and knowledge
formation processes. Two user studies showed that KnowledgeTrail fosters
curiosity-driven exploration, serendipitous discovery, and the ability to trace
complex relationships between ideas and events, while citation features
supported verification yet revealed fragile trust shaped by perceptions of
source credibility. We contribute a vision for generative timelines as a new
class of exploratory interface, along with design insights for balancing
serendipity and credibility.

TL;DR: AR-CAD与传统CAD系统的比较研究表明，AR-CAD对新手设计师更友好，能降低认知负荷并提高任务完成率，而传统CAD更适合有经验用户的高级功能需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AR-CAD系统与传统CAD软件在用户体验、任务完成率和认知负荷方面的差异，探索沉浸式界面如何弥合新手和经验用户之间的差距。

Method: 对20名不同技能水平的参与者进行对比研究，使用AR-CAD和SolidWorks完成3D建模任务，测量任务完成时间、完成率、NASA TLX认知负荷和系统可用性量表(SUS)。

Result: 新手在AR-CAD中完成率更高，认知负荷更低，SUS评分更高；有经验用户在两系统中完成率相似，但偏好传统CAD的高级功能；AR-CAD适合快速概念开发和设计教育。

Conclusion: AR-CAD有潜力通过降低入门门槛来增强设计实践，未来需要改进高精度输入工具并评估复杂设计流程。

Abstract: The paper presents a comparative user study between an Augmented
Reality-based Computer-Aided Design (AR-CAD) system and a traditional
computer-based CAD modeling software, SolidWorks. Twenty participants of
varying skill levels performed 3D modeling tasks using both systems. The
results showed that while the average task completion time is comparable for
both groups, novice designers had a higher completion rate in AR-CAD than in
the traditional CAD interface, and experienced designers had a similar
completion rate in both systems. A statistical comparison of task completion
rate, time, and NASA Task Load Index (TLX) showed that AR-CAD slightly reduced
cognitive load while favoring a high task completion rate. Higher scores on the
System Usability Scale (SUS) by novices indicated that AR-CAD was superior and
worthwhile for reducing barriers to entering CAD. In contrast, the Traditional
CAD interface was favored by experienced users for its advanced capabilities,
while many viewed AR-CAD as a valid means for rapid concept development,
education, and an initial critique of designs. This opens up the need for
future research on the needed refinement of AR-CAD with a focus on
high-precision input tools and its evaluation of complex design processes. This
research highlights the potential for immersive interfaces to enhance design
practice, bridging the gap between novice and experienced CAD users.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管对沉浸式环境中自然语言交互的兴趣日益增长，但用户在语音中使用体现性线索的模式及其与意图表达的关系仍未充分探索，理解这种相互作用对于弥合用户意图与沉浸式分析系统之间的差距至关重要。

Method: 采用Wizard of Oz方法对15名参与者进行用户研究，对734个话语中的1,280个言语行为进行轴编码，分析分析任务如何通过体现性和语言特征执行，并测量每个分析任务的语音输入不确定性。

Result: 识别了五种语音输入模式，显示用户根据数据分析任务、阶段和体现性依赖程度，动态混合使用体现性和非体现性言语行为，这些模式与用户在研究中遇到的语音交互挑战因素相一致。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了体现性如何塑造用户在沉浸式分析中的语音表达模式，提出了与五种模式相一致的设计建议，以改善沉浸式分析系统中的语音交互体验。

Abstract: Embodiment shapes how users verbally express intent when interacting with
data through speech interfaces in immersive analytics. Despite growing interest
in Natural Language Interaction (NLI) for visual analytics in immersive
environments, users' speech patterns and their use of embodiment cues in speech
remain underexplored. Understanding their interplay is crucial to bridging the
gap between users' intent and an immersive analytic system. To address this, we
report the results from 15 participants in a user study conducted using the
Wizard of Oz method. We performed axial coding on 1,280 speech acts derived
from 734 utterances, examining how analysis tasks are carried out with
embodiment and linguistic features. Next, we measured speech input uncertainty
for each analysis task using the semantic entropy of utterances, estimating how
uncertain users' speech inputs appear to an analytic system. Through these
analyses, we identified five speech input patterns, showing that users
dynamically blend embodied and non-embodied speech acts depending on data
analysis tasks, phases, and embodiment reliance driven by the counts and types
of embodiment cues in each utterance. We then examined how these patterns align
with user reflections on factors that challenge speech interaction during the
study. Finally, we propose design implications aligned with the five patterns.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注对话式AI的技术能力，但缺乏从视觉障碍者角度探讨他们期望的未来生活愿景。

Method: 使用基于音频的设计虚构探针，与14名视觉障碍参与者进行未来对话式AI的推测性对话研究。

Result: 参与者希望用AI探索新机会和地点，但也关注自主权平衡、视力损失程度多样性考虑，以及提高视觉障碍者可见性。

Conclusion: 设计对话式AI时应支持视觉障碍者的真正自主权，基于他们设想的未来生活愿景。

Abstract: People with visual impairments (PVI) use a variety of assistive technologies
to navigate their daily lives, and conversational AI (CAI) tools are a growing
part of this toolset. Much existing HCI research has focused on the technical
capabilities of current CAI tools, but in this paper, we instead examine how
PVI themselves envision potential futures for living with CAI. We conducted a
study with 14 participants with visual impairments using an audio-based Design
Fiction probe featuring speculative dialogues between participants and a future
CAI. Participants imagined using CAI to expand their boundaries by exploring
new opportunities or places, but also voiced concerns about balancing reliance
on CAI with maintaining autonomy, the need to consider diverse levels of
vision-loss, and enhancing visibility of PVI for greater inclusion. We discuss
implications for designing CAI that support genuine agency for PVI based on the
future lives they envisioned.

Motivation: 可视化仪表板通常需要作者进行耗时的入门培训，而准备这些材料既费时又需要手动更新。多模态交互的最新进展为支持自主入门提供了可能。

Method: 开发了DIANA多模态仪表板助手，结合聊天、音频和鼠标交互，在仪表板界面中直接提供解释，每个交互方式都会突出显示相关的仪表板功能以支持用户定位。

Result: 进行了定性用户研究，了解不同交互方式在不同类型入门任务及其复杂性中的使用情况。

Conclusion: 与仅依赖文本聊天的典型LLM系统不同，DIANA结合多种交互方式直接在仪表板界面中提供解释，支持用户自主熟悉仪表板。

Abstract: Visualization dashboards are regularly used for data exploration and
analysis, but their complex interactions and interlinked views often require
time-consuming onboarding sessions from dashboard authors. Preparing these
onboarding materials is labor-intensive and requires manual updates when
dashboards change. Recent advances in multimodal interaction powered by large
language models (LLMs) provide ways to support self-guided onboarding. We
present DIANA (Dashboard Interactive Assistant for Navigation and Analysis), a
multimodal dashboard assistant that helps users for navigation and guided
analysis through chat, audio, and mouse-based interactions. Users can choose
any interaction modality or a combination of them to onboard themselves on the
dashboard. Each modality highlights relevant dashboard features to support user
orientation. Unlike typical LLM systems that rely solely on text-based chat,
DIANA combines multiple modalities to provide explanations directly in the
dashboard interface. We conducted a qualitative user study to understand the
use of different modalities for different types of onboarding tasks and their
complexities.

Motivation: VR是面试培训的有前景工具，但群体面试中的心理动态（如社会比较）尚未充分探索。

Method: 开发沉浸式VR群面系统，通过模糊行为线索（如举手）和客观信息（公开测试分数）操纵同伴表现，测量其对参与者注意力和自我概念的影响。

Result: 高成就同伴行为增强了社会比较信息处理，显著降低了自我评估；客观分数的引入进一步强化了比较行为；VR环境感知真实度较低与更高焦虑相关。

Conclusion: 为创建更有效、考虑复杂社会动态的心理感知虚拟培训环境提供了关键见解和设计考虑。

Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) is a promising tool for interview training, yet the
psychological dynamics of group interviews, such as social comparison, remain
underexplored. We investigate this phenomenon by developing an immersive VR
group interview system and conducting an eye-tracking study with 73
participants. We manipulated peer performance using ambiguous behavioral cues
(e.g., hand-raising) and objective information (public test scores) to measure
their effect on participants' attention and self-concept. Our results
demonstrate a "Big-Fish-Little-Pond Effect" in VR: an increase in
high-achieving peer behaviors heightened participants' processing of social
comparison information and significantly lowered their self-assessments. The
introduction of objective scores further intensified these comparative
behaviors. We also found that lower perceived realism of the VR environment
correlated with higher anxiety. These findings offer key insights and design
considerations for creating more effective and psychologically-aware virtual
training environments that account for complex social dynamics.

Method: 开发了混合词汇-语义相似度集成算法（HLSE），在哈佛创新挑战赛中部署，并与人类专家分配进行对比评估，收集了309对评委-创业项目的匹配质量评分。

Result: 使用Mann-Whitney U检验发现两种方法在分配质量上无显著差异（AUC=0.48, p=0.40），算法匹配平均评分3.90，人工匹配3.94（5分制）。算法将原本需要一周的人工分配时间缩短至几小时。

Conclusion: HLSE算法在评委分配任务中达到人类专家水平的匹配质量，同时提供更好的可扩展性和效率，证明了AI驱动解决方案在高风险环境中支持和增强人类决策的潜力。

Abstract: There is growing interest in applying artificial intelligence (AI) to
automate and support complex decision-making tasks. However, it remains unclear
how algorithms compare to human judgment in contexts requiring semantic
understanding and domain expertise. We examine this in the context of the judge
assignment problem, matching submissions to suitably qualified judges.
Specifically, we tackled this problem at the Harvard President's Innovation
Challenge, the university's premier venture competition awarding over \$500,000
to student and alumni startups. This represents a real-world environment where
high-quality judge assignment is essential. We developed an AI-based
judge-assignment algorithm, Hybrid Lexical-Semantic Similarity Ensemble (HLSE),
and deployed it at the competition. We then evaluated its performance against
human expert assignments using blinded match-quality scores from judges on
$309$ judge-venture pairs. Using a Mann-Whitney U statistic based test, we
found no statistically significant difference in assignment quality between the
two approaches ($AUC=0.48, p=0.40$); on average, algorithmic matches are rated
$3.90$ and manual matches $3.94$ on a 5-point scale, where 5 indicates an
excellent match. Furthermore, manual assignments that previously required a
full week could be automated in several hours by the algorithm during
deployment. These results demonstrate that HLSE achieves human-expert-level
matching quality while offering greater scalability and efficiency,
underscoring the potential of AI-driven solutions to support and enhance human
decision-making for judge assignment in high-stakes settings.

*Minjae Lee,Minsuk Kahng*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种交互式系统，通过数据-模型协同进化的方法，帮助开发者将领域特定政策编码到提示指令中，实现更稳健和负责任的LLM应用开发。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习中数据工作和模型优化之间存在严格分离，而大语言模型的出现打破了这一障碍，允许通过编辑提示指令来即时控制模型行为，这催生了数据-模型协同进化的新范式。

Method: 开发了一个交互式系统，采用结构化工作流程，指导用户发现边缘案例、阐明期望行为的理由，并针对不断增长的测试集迭代评估指令修订。

Result: 用户研究表明，该工作流程帮助参与者系统性地优化指令，并将模糊政策更具体地明确化。

Conclusion: 这项工作指向通过人机协同开发，使LLM应用更好地符合本地偏好和政策，实现更稳健和负责任的应用开发。

Abstract: A long-standing challenge in machine learning has been the rigid separation
between data work and model refinement, enforced by slow fine-tuning cycles.
The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) overcomes this historical barrier,
allowing applications developers to instantly govern model behavior by editing
prompt instructions. This shift enables a new paradigm: data-model
co-evolution, where a living test set and a model's instructions evolve in
tandem. We operationalize this paradigm in an interactive system designed to
address the critical challenge of encoding subtle, domain-specific policies
into prompt instructions. The system's structured workflow guides people to
discover edge cases, articulate rationales for desired behavior, and
iteratively evaluate instruction revisions against a growing test set. A user
study shows our workflow helps participants refine instructions systematically
and specify ambiguous policies more concretely. This work points toward more
robust and responsible LLM applications through human-in-the-loop development
aligned with local preferences and policies.

TL;DR: 本文回顾了无绳移动毫米/微型机器人在介入医学中的转化挑战，提出了技术就绪水平框架（mTRL）来加速从实验室到临床的转化过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管毫米/微型机器人在过去二十年取得了显著技术进展，但大多数仍停留在实验室概念验证阶段，缺乏实际临床应用的可行性。需要弥合技术创新与现实应用之间的差距。

Method: 引入战略性的毫米/微型机器人技术就绪水平框架（mTRL），该系统开发从初始概念化到临床采用，通过明确定义的里程碑和相关的逐步活动进行映射。

Result: mTRL模型提供了一个结构化技术成熟度评估标准，为跨学科合作提供共同语言，并为加速转化发展提供可操作指导。

Conclusion: 该领域的长期影响和可持续性取决于将开发与未满足的医疗需求对齐，确保应用可行性，并无缝集成到现有临床工作流程中，这些是实现有意义患者结果的基本支柱。

Abstract: Untethered mobile milli/microrobots hold transformative potential for
interventional medicine by enabling more precise and entirely non-invasive
diagnosis and therapy. Realizing this promise requires bridging the gap between
groundbreaking laboratory demonstrations and successful clinical integration.
Despite remarkable technical progress over the past two decades, most
millirobots and microrobots remain confined to laboratory proof-of-concept
demonstrations, with limited real-world feasibility. In this Review, we
identify key factors that slow translation from bench to bedside, focusing on
the disconnect between technical innovation and real-world application. We
argue that the long-term impact and sustainability of the field depend on
aligning development with unmet medical needs, ensuring applied feasibility,
and integrating seamlessly into existing clinical workflows, which are
essential pillars for delivering meaningful patient outcomes. To support this
shift, we introduce a strategic milli/microrobot Technology Readiness Level
framework (mTRL), which maps system development from initial conceptualization
to clinical adoption through clearly defined milestones and their associated
stepwise activities. The mTRL model provides a structured gauge of
technological maturity, a common language for cross-disciplinary collaboration
and actionable guidance to accelerate translational development toward new,
safer and more efficient interventions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于轻量级三层场景图的单次LiDAR全局定位算法，通过高斯过程学习语义分布的连续函数来增强语义消歧能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然基于地标语义配准的方法在全局定位中相比纯几何方法表现更好，但地标可能重复且对对应关系建立产生误导，需要解决语义消歧问题。

Method: 使用高斯过程学习语义分布的连续函数，构建包含对象层、连续函数层和度量语义层的三层3D场景图，作为单次定位的轻量后端。

Result: 在公开数据集上的广泛实验验证了该方法相比当前最先进方法的优越性能。

Conclusion: 提出的Outram-GSF全局定位管道通过连续语义函数有效解决了语义消歧问题，实现了高性能的单次LiDAR全局定位。

Abstract: We present a one-shot LiDAR global localization algorithm featuring semantic
disambiguation ability based on a lightweight tri-layered scene graph. While
landmark semantic registration-based methods have shown promising performance
improvements in global localization compared with geometric-only methods,
landmarks can be repetitive and misleading for correspondence establishment. We
propose to mitigate this problem by modeling semantic distributions with
continuous functions learned from a population of Gaussian processes. Compared
with discrete semantic labels, the continuous functions capture finer-grained
geo-semantic information and also provide more detailed metric information for
correspondence establishment. We insert this continuous function as the middle
layer between the object layer and the metric-semantic layer, forming a
tri-layered 3D scene graph, serving as a light-weight yet performant backend
for one-shot localization. We term our global localization pipeline Outram-GSF
(Gaussian semantic field) and conduct a wide range of experiments on publicly
available data sets, validating the superior performance against the current
state-of-the-art.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于越野自动驾驶车辆的实时路径规划框架，结合地形成本和车辆动力学约束，支持在软土和斜坡等非结构化环境中可靠导航。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 越野自动驾驶车辆需要在考虑土壤强度和坡度等空间变化的地形因素的同时，实时规划可行的曲率路径，以确保在非结构化环境中的可靠自主导航。

Method: 开发了连续状态-成本度量，结合Bekker压力-沉降模型和基于高程的坡度惩罚；在格网上评估该度量，使用精确的转向基元（Dubins、Reeds-Shepp运动）；采用Vehicle-Dynamics RRT*进行全局探索，Vehicle-Dynamics D* Lite进行局部修复。

Result: 硬件试验表明，该框架能够在软土和斜坡过渡区域实现实时导航，支持非结构化环境中的可靠自主性。

Conclusion: 通过将地形-车辆模型与规划器分离，该框架为可变形地形中的确定性、基于采样或学习驱动的规划提供了可重用的基础。

Abstract: Autonomous ground vehicles operating off-road must plan curvature-feasible
paths while accounting for spatially varying soil strength and slope hazards in
real time. We present a continuous state--cost metric that combines a Bekker
pressure--sinkage model with elevation-derived slope and attitude penalties.
The resulting terrain cost field is analytic, bounded, and monotonic in soil
modulus and slope, ensuring well-posed discretization and stable updates under
sensor noise. This metric is evaluated on a lattice with exact steering
primitives: Dubins and Reeds--Shepp motions for differential drive and
time-parameterized bicycle arcs for Ackermann steering. Global exploration is
performed using Vehicle-Dynamics RRT\(^{*}\), while local repair is managed by
Vehicle-Dynamics D\(^{*}\) Lite, enabling millisecond-scale replanning without
heuristic smoothing. By separating the terrain--vehicle model from the planner,
the framework provides a reusable basis for deterministic, sampling-based, or
learning-driven planning in deformable terrain. Hardware trials on an off-road
platform demonstrate real-time navigation across soft soil and slope
transitions, supporting reliable autonomy in unstructured environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估自动驾驶车辆安全性需要多样化的安全关键场景，特别是碰撞场景，但在现实中收集这些场景既罕见又不安全，因此需要在仿真中生成可控的碰撞场景。

Method: 构建COLLIDE大规模碰撞场景数据集，提出预测碰撞模式的框架，该模式捕捉碰撞时自车和对抗车辆的空间配置，然后生成完整的对抗轨迹。

Result: 方法在碰撞率和可控性方面优于强基线，生成的场景能持续诱导更高的规划器失败率，并可用于微调规划器以提高鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的可控碰撞场景生成方法能有效生成所需碰撞场景，有助于发现现有规划器的局限性并改进其安全性，促进自动驾驶的安全部署。

Abstract: Evaluating the safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs) requires diverse,
safety-critical scenarios, with collisions being especially important yet rare
and unsafe to collect in the real world. Therefore, the community has been
focusing on generating safety-critical scenarios in simulation. However,
controlling attributes such as collision type and time-to-accident (TTA)
remains challenging. We introduce a new task called controllable collision
scenario generation, where the goal is to produce trajectories that realize a
user-specified collision type and TTA, to investigate the feasibility of
automatically generating desired collision scenarios. To support this task, we
present COLLIDE, a large-scale collision scenario dataset constructed by
transforming real-world driving logs into diverse collisions, balanced across
five representative collision types and different TTA intervals. We propose a
framework that predicts Collision Pattern, a compact and interpretable
representation that captures the spatial configuration of the ego and the
adversarial vehicles at impact, before rolling out full adversarial
trajectories. Experiments show that our approach outperforms strong baselines
in both collision rate and controllability. Furthermore, generated scenarios
consistently induce higher planner failure rates, revealing limitations of
existing planners. We demonstrate that these scenarios fine-tune planners for
robustness improvements, contributing to safer AV deployment in different
collision scenarios.

Result: 在合成和电梯共乘模拟中，相比基线方法在成功率和时间效率上获得一致提升，真实世界演示验证了部署的实用性。

Conclusion: 该框架有效平衡了导航策略的适应性和安全性，在动态人类环境中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Mobile robot navigation in dynamic human environments requires policies that
balance adaptability to diverse behaviors with compliance to safety
constraints. We hypothesize that integrating data-driven rewards with
rule-based objectives enables navigation policies to achieve a more effective
balance of adaptability and safety. To this end, we develop a framework that
learns a density-based reward from positive and negative demonstrations and
augments it with rule-based objectives for obstacle avoidance and goal
reaching. A sampling-based lookahead controller produces supervisory actions
that are both safe and adaptive, which are subsequently distilled into a
compact student policy suitable for real-time operation with uncertainty
estimates. Experiments in synthetic and elevator co-boarding simulations show
consistent gains in success rate and time efficiency over baselines, and
real-world demonstrations with human participants confirm the practicality of
deployment. A video illustrating this work can be found on our project page

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Spatial Forcing (SF)的简单有效对齐策略，通过将VLA模型的中间视觉嵌入与预训练3D基础模型生成的几何表示对齐，隐式地增强VLA模型的空间理解能力，无需依赖显式3D输入或深度估计器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLA模型大多基于仅使用2D数据预训练的视觉语言模型，缺乏准确的空间感知能力，限制了其在3D物理世界中的操作能力。现有解决方案要么依赖有噪声的3D传感器输入，要么受限于深度估计器的性能。

Method: SF策略在中间层将VLA的视觉嵌入与预训练3D基础模型产生的几何表示进行对齐，引导VLA编码更丰富的空间表示，从而提升动作精度。

Result: 在仿真和真实环境中的大量实验表明，SF实现了最先进的性能，超越了基于2D和3D的VLA模型，同时将训练速度提升了最高3.8倍，并在多样化机器人任务中提高了数据效率。

Conclusion: SF是一种简单有效的策略，能够隐式地增强VLA模型的空间理解能力，无需依赖显式3D输入，在提升性能的同时显著提高了训练效率。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have recently shown strong potential in
enabling robots to follow language instructions and execute precise actions.
However, most VLAs are built upon vision-language models pretrained solely on
2D data, which lack accurate spatial awareness and hinder their ability to
operate in the 3D physical world. Existing solutions attempt to incorporate
explicit 3D sensor inputs such as depth maps or point clouds, but these
approaches face challenges due to sensor noise, hardware heterogeneity, and
incomplete depth coverage in existing datasets. Alternative methods that
estimate 3D cues from 2D images also suffer from the limited performance of
depth estimators.We propose Spatial Forcing (SF), a simple yet effective
alignment strategy that implicitly forces VLA models to develop spatial
comprehension capabilities without relying on explicit 3D inputs or depth
estimators. SF aligns intermediate visual embeddings of VLAs with geometric
representations produced by pretrained 3D foundation models. By enforcing
alignment at intermediate layers, SF guides VLAs to encode richer spatial
representations that enhance action precision.Extensive experiments in
simulation and real-world environments demonstrate that SF achieves
state-of-the-art results, surpassing both 2D- and 3D-based VLAs. SF further
accelerates training by up to 3.8x and improves data efficiency across diverse
robotic tasks. Project page is at https://spatial-forcing.github.io/

Abstract: This paper presents a shape-aware whole-body control framework for
tendon-driven continuum robots with direct application to endoluminal surgical
navigation. Endoluminal procedures, such as bronchoscopy, demand precise and
safe navigation through tortuous, patient-specific anatomy where conventional
tip-only control often leads to wall contact, tissue trauma, or failure to
reach distal targets. To address these challenges, our approach combines a
physics-informed backbone model with residual learning through an Augmented
Neural ODE, enabling accurate shape estimation and efficient Jacobian
computation. A sampling-based Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller
leverages this representation to jointly optimize tip tracking, backbone
conformance, and obstacle avoidance under actuation constraints. A task manager
further enhances adaptability by allowing real-time adjustment of objectives,
such as wall clearance or direct advancement, during tele-operation. Extensive
simulation studies demonstrate millimeter-level accuracy across diverse
scenarios, including trajectory tracking, dynamic obstacle avoidance, and
shape-constrained reaching. Real-robot experiments on a bronchoscopy phantom
validate the framework, showing improved lumen-following accuracy, reduced wall
contacts, and enhanced adaptability compared to joystick-only navigation and
existing baselines. These results highlight the potential of the proposed
framework to increase safety, reliability, and operator efficiency in minimally
invasive endoluminal surgery, with broader applicability to other confined and
safety-critical environments.

Abstract: Recently, biped robot walking technology has been significantly developed,
mainly in the context of a bland walking scheme. To emulate human walking,
robots need to step on the positions they see in unknown spaces accurately. In
this paper, we present PolyMap, a perception-based locomotion planning
framework for humanoid robots to climb stairs. Our core idea is to build a
real-time polygonal staircase plane semantic map, followed by a footstep planar
using these polygonal plane segments. These plane segmentation and visual
odometry are done by multi-sensor fusion(LiDAR, RGB-D camera and IMUs). The
proposed framework is deployed on a NVIDIA Orin, which performs 20-30 Hz
whole-body motion planning output. Both indoor and outdoor real-scene
experiments indicate that our method is efficient and robust for humanoid robot
stair climbing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 提出的预训练初始化策略在机器人强化学习中具有显著优势，通过逆动力学模型预训练可以有效封装机器人运动控制中的共享知识，为后续任务学习提供良好的初始化基础。

Abstract: The pretraining-finetuning paradigm has facilitated numerous transformative
advancements in artificial intelligence research in recent years. However, in
the domain of reinforcement learning (RL) for robot motion control, individual
skills are often learned from scratch despite the high likelihood that some
generalizable knowledge is shared across all task-specific policies belonging
to a single robot embodiment. This work aims to define a paradigm for
pretraining neural network models that encapsulate such knowledge and can
subsequently serve as a basis for warm-starting the RL process in classic
actor-critic algorithms, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). We begin
with a task-agnostic exploration-based data collection algorithm to gather
diverse, dynamic transition data, which is then used to train a Proprioceptive
Inverse Dynamics Model (PIDM) through supervised learning. The pretrained
weights are loaded into both the actor and critic networks to warm-start the
policy optimization of actual tasks. We systematically validated our proposed
method on seven distinct robot motion control tasks, showing significant
benefits to this initialization strategy. Our proposed approach on average
improves sample efficiency by 40.1% and task performance by 7.5%, compared to
random initialization. We further present key ablation studies and empirical
analyses that shed light on the mechanisms behind the effectiveness of our
method.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的运动生成框架，能够在从高度可读性到高度模糊性的全谱系中实现可控的可读性，通过信息势场建模和两阶段扩散框架生成不同可读性水平的轨迹。


<details>

Motivation: 传统轨迹生成方法通常优先考虑效率，但未能使机器人的意图对人类清晰；现有可读性运动方法通常只产生单一"最可读"轨迹，忽视了在不同情境下调节意图表达的需求。

Method: 基于信息势场建模为轨迹分配连续可读性分数，并构建两阶段扩散框架：首先生成指定可读性水平的路径，然后将其转换为可执行的机器人动作。

Result: 在2D和3D到达任务中的实验表明，该方法能够产生具有不同可读性程度的多样化可控运动，同时达到与最先进方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了机器人运动可读性的连续控制，为人类-机器人交互中的意图表达提供了灵活的工具。

Abstract: Legibility of robot motion is critical in human-robot interaction, as it
allows humans to quickly infer a robot's intended goal. Although traditional
trajectory generation methods typically prioritize efficiency, they often fail
to make the robot's intentions clear to humans. Meanwhile, existing approaches
to legible motion usually produce only a single "most legible" trajectory,
overlooking the need to modulate intent expressiveness in different contexts.
In this work, we propose a novel motion generation framework that enables
controllable legibility across the full spectrum, from highly legible to highly
ambiguous motions. We introduce a modeling approach based on an Information
Potential Field to assign continuous legibility scores to trajectories, and
build upon it with a two-stage diffusion framework that first generates paths
at specified legibility levels and then translates them into executable robot
actions. Experiments in both 2D and 3D reaching tasks demonstrate that our
approach produces diverse and controllable motions with varying degrees of
legibility, while achieving performance comparable to SOTA. Code and project

Result: 在广泛的模拟和真实世界机器人操作任务中，该方法显著提升了生成行为克隆的性能

Conclusion: 所提出的自引导和自适应分块技术有效解决了扩散策略的一致性和反应性问题，为生成行为克隆提供了更可靠的解决方案

Abstract: Generative Behavior Cloning (GBC) is a simple yet effective framework for
robot learning, particularly in multi-task settings. Recent GBC methods often
employ diffusion policies with open-loop (OL) control, where actions are
generated via a diffusion process and executed in multi-step chunks without
replanning. While this approach has demonstrated strong success rates and
generalization, its inherent stochasticity can result in erroneous action
sampling, occasionally leading to unexpected task failures. Moreover, OL
control suffers from delayed responses, which can degrade performance in noisy
or dynamic environments. To address these limitations, we propose two novel
techniques to enhance the consistency and reactivity of diffusion policies: (1)
self-guidance, which improves action fidelity by leveraging past observations
and implicitly promoting future-aware behavior; and (2) adaptive chunking,
which selectively updates action sequences when the benefits of reactivity
outweigh the need for temporal consistency. Extensive experiments show that our
approach substantially improves GBC performance across a wide range of
simulated and real-world robotic manipulation tasks. Our code is available at

Abstract: In the evolving landscape of high-speed agile quadrotor flight, achieving
precise trajectory tracking at the platform's operational limits is paramount.
Controllers must handle actuator constraints, exhibit robustness to
disturbances, and remain computationally efficient for safety-critical
applications. In this work, we present a novel neural-augmented feedback
controller for agile flight control. The controller addresses individual
limitations of existing state-of-the-art control paradigms and unifies their
strengths. We demonstrate the controller's capabilities, including the accurate
tracking of highly aggressive trajectories that surpass the feasibility of the
actuators. Notably, the controller provides universal stability guarantees,
enhancing its robustness and tracking performance even in exceedingly
disturbance-prone settings. Its nonlinear feedback structure is highly
efficient enabling fast computation at high update rates. Moreover, the
learning process in simulation is both fast and stable, and the controller's
inherent robustness allows direct deployment to real-world platforms without
the need for training augmentations or fine-tuning.

Abstract: Robotics plays a pivotal role in planetary science and exploration, where
autonomous and reliable systems are crucial due to the risks and challenges
inherent to space environments. The establishment of permanent lunar bases
demands robotic platforms capable of navigating and manipulating in the harsh
lunar terrain. While wheeled rovers have been the mainstay for planetary
exploration, their limitations in unstructured and steep terrains motivate the
adoption of legged robots, which offer superior mobility and adaptability. This
paper introduces a constrained reinforcement learning framework designed for
autonomous quadrupedal mobile manipulators operating in lunar environments. The
proposed framework integrates whole-body locomotion and manipulation
capabilities while explicitly addressing critical safety constraints, including
collision avoidance, dynamic stability, and power efficiency, in order to
ensure robust performance under lunar-specific conditions, such as reduced
gravity and irregular terrain. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in achieving precise 6D task-space end-effector pose tracking,
achieving an average positional accuracy of 4 cm and orientation accuracy of
8.1 degrees. The system consistently respects both soft and hard constraints,
exhibiting adaptive behaviors optimized for lunar gravity conditions. This work
effectively bridges adaptive learning with essential mission-critical safety
requirements, paving the way for advanced autonomous robotic explorers for
future lunar missions.

Abstract: Tactile sensors have a wide range of applications, from utilization in
robotic grippers to human motion measurement. If tactile sensors could be
fabricated and integrated more easily, their applicability would further
expand. In this study, we propose a tactile sensor-M3D-skin-that can be easily
fabricated with high versatility by leveraging the infill patterns of a
multi-material fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printer as the sensing
principle. This method employs conductive and non-conductive flexible filaments
to create a hierarchical structure with a specific infill pattern. The flexible
hierarchical structure deforms under pressure, leading to a change in
electrical resistance, enabling the acquisition of tactile information. We
measure the changes in characteristics of the proposed tactile sensor caused by
modifications to the hierarchical structure. Additionally, we demonstrate the
fabrication and use of a multi-tile sensor. Furthermore, as applications, we
implement motion pattern measurement on the sole of a foot, integration with a
robotic hand, and tactile-based robotic operations. Through these experiments,
we validate the effectiveness of the proposed tactile sensor.

Abstract: In a Human-Robot Cooperation (HRC) environment, safety and efficiency are the
two core properties to evaluate robot performance. However, safety mechanisms
usually hinder task efficiency since human intervention will cause backup
motions and goal failures of the robot. Frequent motion replanning will
increase the computational load and the chance of failure. In this paper, we
present a hybrid Reinforcement Learning (RL) planning framework which is
comprised of an interactive motion planner and a RL task planner. The RL task
planner attempts to choose statistically safe and efficient task sequences
based on the feedback from the motion planner, while the motion planner keeps
the task execution process collision-free by detecting human arm motions and
deploying new paths when the previous path is not valid anymore. Intuitively,
the RL agent will learn to avoid dangerous tasks, while the motion planner
ensures that the chosen tasks are safe. The proposed framework is validated on
the cobot in both simulation and the real world, we compare the planner with
hard-coded task motion planning methods. The results show that our planning
framework can 1) react to uncertain human motions at both joint and task
levels; 2) reduce the times of repeating failed goal commands; 3) reduce the
total number of replanning requests.

resource-constrained systems. Unlike existing robotic policies, Energy Policy
natively predicts multimodal actions in a single forward pass, enabling
high-precision manipulation at high speed. The framework is built upon two core

facilitate multimodal action modeling. Second, we introduce an energy MLP to
implement the proposed objective while keeping the architecture simple and
efficient. We conduct comprehensive experiments in both simulated environments

Abstract: Pruning is an essential agricultural practice for orchards. Proper pruning
can promote healthier growth and optimize fruit production throughout the
orchard's lifespan. Robot manipulators have been developed as an automated
solution for this repetitive task, which typically requires seasonal labor with
specialized skills. While previous research has primarily focused on the
challenges of perception, the complexities of manipulation are often
overlooked. These challenges involve planning and control in both joint and
Cartesian spaces to guide the end-effector through intricate, obstructive
branches. Our work addresses the behavior planning challenge for a robotic
pruning system, which entails a multi-level planning problem in environments
with complex collisions. In this paper, we formulate the planning problem for a
high-dimensional robotic arm in a pruning scenario, investigate the system's
intrinsic redundancies, and propose a comprehensive pruning workflow that
integrates perception, modeling, and holistic planning. In our experiments, we
demonstrate that more comprehensive planning methods can significantly enhance
the performance of the robotic manipulator. Finally, we implement the proposed
workflow on a real-world robot. As a result, this work complements previous
efforts on robotic pruning and motivates future research and development in
planning for pruning applications.

Conclusion: 该方法专注于物体物理属性感知，增强了人工触觉系统从感知到认知的能力，使其能够在具身感知应用中使用。

Abstract: Tactile perception is crucial for embodied intelligent robots to recognize
objects. Vision-based tactile sensors extract object physical attributes
multidimensionally using high spatial resolution; however, this process
generates abundant redundant information. Furthermore, single-dimensional
extraction, lacking effective fusion, fails to fully characterize object
attributes. These challenges hinder the improvement of recognition accuracy. To
address this issue, this study introduces a two-stream network feature
extraction and fusion perception strategy for vision-based tactile systems.
This strategy employs a distributed approach to extract internal and external
object features. It obtains depth map information through three-dimensional
reconstruction while simultaneously acquiring hardness information by measuring
contact force data. After extracting features with a convolutional neural
network (CNN), weighted fusion is applied to create a more informative and
effective feature representation. In standard tests on objects of varying
shapes and hardness, the force prediction error is 0.06 N (within a 12 N
range). Hardness recognition accuracy reaches 98.0%, and shape recognition
accuracy reaches 93.75%. With fusion algorithms, object recognition accuracy in
actual grasping scenarios exceeds 98.5%. Focused on object physical attributes
perception, this method enhances the artificial tactile system ability to
transition from perception to cognition, enabling its use in embodied
perception applications.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种考虑控制置信度的自主工具设计框架，通过引入神经启发的控制置信度项来优化机器人工具设计，提高工具在环境不确定性下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自主工具设计框架仅依赖性能优化，未考虑代理在重复使用工具时的置信度，而史前人类设计工具时会同时考虑目标完成准确性和对工具的置信度，这促使作者开发考虑控制置信度的工具设计方法。

Method: 定义任务条件自主手工具设计优化框架，引入神经启发的控制置信度项到优化流程中，使用CMAES进化优化策略进行工具设计。

Result: 通过机器人臂模拟实验显示，以控制置信度为目标函数设计的工具在环境不确定性下比纯精度驱动目标更鲁棒，且在控制扰动下在鲁棒性和目标精度间取得平衡。CMAES优化器在最少迭代次数内设计出最优工具。

Conclusion: 将控制置信度纳入工具设计目标函数能显著提高工具鲁棒性，为自主工具设计提供了更全面的优化框架。

Abstract: Prehistoric humans invented stone tools for specialized tasks by not just
maximizing the tool's immediate goal-completion accuracy, but also increasing
their confidence in the tool for later use under similar settings. This factor
contributed to the increased robustness of the tool, i.e., the least
performance deviations under environmental uncertainties. However, the current
autonomous tool design frameworks solely rely on performance optimization,
without considering the agent's confidence in tool use for repeated use. Here,
we take a step towards filling this gap by i) defining an optimization
framework for task-conditioned autonomous hand tool design for robots, where
ii) we introduce a neuro-inspired control confidence term into the optimization
routine that helps the agent to design tools with higher robustness. Through
rigorous simulations using a robotic arm, we show that tools designed with
control confidence as the objective function are more robust to environmental
uncertainties during tool use than a pure accuracy-driven objective. We further
show that adding control confidence to the objective function for tool design
provides a balance between the robustness and goal accuracy of the designed
tools under control perturbations. Finally, we show that our CMAES-based
evolutionary optimization strategy for autonomous tool design outperforms other
state-of-the-art optimizers by designing the optimal tool within the fewest
iterations. Code: https://github.com/ajitham123/Tool_design_control_confidence.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人如何在保证自身任务完成的同时，与追求不同目标的人类进行有效协作的问题，减少人机干扰并保持人类自主性。

Method: 结合最大适应性和最小可调反馈两个关键能力：最大适应性让机器人能够在线调整策略以利用人类行为进行合作；最小可调反馈仅在必要时请求人类合作以保证任务进展。

Result: 在真实世界块操作任务和Overcooked-AI基准测试中验证，该方法产生了超越现有方法的丰富涌现合作行为，同时保持强大的形式化保证。

Conclusion: 该框架能够平衡人机协作，最小化干扰，保持人类自主性，并确保机器人任务的持续满足，即使在人类目标冲突的情况下也能有效工作。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for human-robot \emph{logical} interaction that
enables robots to reliably satisfy (infinite horizon) temporal logic tasks
while effectively collaborating with humans who pursue independent and unknown
tasks. The framework combines two key capabilities: (i) \emph{maximal
adaptation} enables the robot to adjust its strategy \emph{online} to exploit
human behavior for cooperation whenever possible, and (ii) \emph{minimal
tunable feedback} enables the robot to request cooperation by the human online
only when necessary to guarantee progress. This balance minimizes human-robot
interference, preserves human autonomy, and ensures persistent robot task
satisfaction even under conflicting human goals. We validate the approach in a
real-world block-manipulation task with a Franka Emika Panda robotic arm and in
the Overcooked-AI benchmark, demonstrating that our method produces rich,
\emph{emergent} cooperative behaviors beyond the reach of existing approaches,
while maintaining strong formal guarantees.

TL;DR: 提出Reflective Self-Adaptation框架，通过双路径架构实现VLA模型在机器人任务中的快速自主适应，无需人工干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的视觉-语言-动作模型在向通用机器人发展方面取得重大进展，但在新任务中的高效适应仍面临挑战，强化学习适应过程效率低下。

Method: 采用双路径架构：1) 失败驱动的反思RL路径，利用VLM因果推理从失败分析中自动合成密集奖励函数；2) 成功驱动的质量引导SFT路径，选择性地模仿高质量成功轨迹。

Result: 在复杂操作任务实验中，该框架相比基线方法实现了更快的收敛速度和更高的最终成功率。

Conclusion: 该工作为创建能够高效可靠适应新环境的自改进智能体提供了稳健解决方案。

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models represent a major leap
towards general-purpose robots, yet efficiently adapting them to novel,
specific tasks in-situ remains a significant hurdle. While reinforcement
learning (RL) is a promising avenue for such adaptation, the process often
suffers from low efficiency, hindering rapid task mastery. We introduce
Reflective Self-Adaptation, a framework for rapid, autonomous task adaptation
without human intervention. Our framework establishes a self-improving loop
where the agent learns from its own experience to enhance both strategy and
execution.
  The core of our framework is a dual-pathway architecture that addresses the
full adaptation lifecycle. First, a Failure-Driven Reflective RL pathway
enables rapid learning by using the VLM's causal reasoning to automatically
synthesize a targeted, dense reward function from failure analysis. This
provides a focused learning signal that significantly accelerates policy
exploration. However, optimizing such proxy rewards introduces a potential risk
of "reward hacking," where the agent masters the reward function but fails the
actual task. To counteract this, our second pathway, Success-Driven
Quality-Guided SFT, grounds the policy in holistic success. It identifies and
selectively imitates high-quality successful trajectories, ensuring the agent
remains aligned with the ultimate task goal. This pathway is strengthened by a
conditional curriculum mechanism to aid initial exploration.
  We conduct experiments in challenging manipulation tasks. The results
demonstrate that our framework achieves faster convergence and higher final
success rates compared to representative baselines. Our work presents a robust
solution for creating self-improving agents that can efficiently and reliably
adapt to new environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MPC提供可解释、可调谐的控制器，但鲁棒性受限于模型失配和实时计算约束；RL能产生高度鲁棒行为但缺乏可解释性且需要大量奖励工程。需要结合两者优势。

Method: 开发了运动学全身MPC公式，在100Hz频率下并行评估数千个智能体进行RL训练。残差策略学习对MPC输出进行针对性修正，模型控制先验作为强偏差引导策略。

Result: 相比独立MPC或端到端RL，该方法实现了更高的样本效率、更大的渐近奖励、更广的速度命令跟踪范围，并能零样本适应未见步态和不平坦地形。

Conclusion: 该方法成功结合了MPC和RL的优势，提供了解释性强且适应性好的控制框架，在机器人运动控制中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) provides interpretable, tunable locomotion
controllers grounded in physical models, but its robustness depends on frequent
replanning and is limited by model mismatch and real-time computational
constraints. Reinforcement Learning (RL), by contrast, can produce highly
robust behaviors through stochastic training but often lacks interpretability,
suffers from out-of-distribution failures, and requires intensive reward
engineering. This work presents a GPU-parallelized residual architecture that
tightly integrates MPC and RL by blending their outputs at the torque-control
level. We develop a kinodynamic whole-body MPC formulation evaluated across
thousands of agents in parallel at 100 Hz for RL training. The residual policy
learns to make targeted corrections to the MPC outputs, combining the
interpretability and constraint handling of model-based control with the
adaptability of RL. The model-based control prior acts as a strong bias,
initializing and guiding the policy towards desirable behavior with a simple
set of rewards. Compared to standalone MPC or end-to-end RL, our approach
achieves higher sample efficiency, converges to greater asymptotic rewards,
expands the range of trackable velocity commands, and enables zero-shot
adaptation to unseen gaits and uneven terrain.

Abstract: Dexterous grasping remains a central challenge in robotics due to the
complexity of its high-dimensional state and action space. We introduce T(R,O)
Grasp, a diffusion-based framework that efficiently generates accurate and
diverse grasps across multiple robotic hands. At its core is the T(R,O) Graph,
a unified representation that models spatial transformations between robotic
hands and objects while encoding their geometric properties. A graph diffusion
model, coupled with an efficient inverse kinematics solver, supports both
unconditioned and conditioned grasp synthesis. Extensive experiments on a
diverse set of dexterous hands show that T(R,O) Grasp achieves average success
rate of 94.83%, inference speed of 0.21s, and throughput of 41 grasps per
second on an NVIDIA A100 40GB GPU, substantially outperforming existing
baselines. In addition, our approach is robust and generalizable across
embodiments while significantly reducing memory consumption. More importantly,
the high inference speed enables closed-loop dexterous manipulation,
underscoring the potential of T(R,O) Grasp to scale into a foundation model for

Conclusion: HYPE通过将学习到的提案与MCTS细化相结合，显著简化了成本函数设计，在复杂城市环境中实现了安全、可解释且高性能的运动规划。

Abstract: Safe and interpretable motion planning in complex urban environments needs to
reason about bidirectional multi-agent interactions. This reasoning requires to
estimate the costs of potential ego driving maneuvers. Many existing planners
generate initial trajectories with sampling-based methods and refine them by
optimizing on learned predictions of future environment states, which requires
a cost function that encodes the desired vehicle behavior. Designing such a
cost function can be very challenging, especially if a wide range of complex
urban scenarios has to be considered. We propose HYPE: HYbrid Planning with Ego
proposal-conditioned predictions, a planner that integrates multimodal
trajectory proposals from a learned proposal model as heuristic priors into a
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) refinement. To model bidirectional interactions,
we introduce an ego-conditioned occupancy prediction model, enabling
consistent, scene-aware reasoning. Our design significantly simplifies cost
function design in refinement by considering proposal-driven guidance,
requiring only minimalistic grid-based cost terms. Evaluations on large-scale
real-world benchmarks nuPlan and DeepUrban show that HYPE effectively achieves
state-of-the-art performance, especially in safety and adaptability.

Result: 在1024轮模拟中，基于规则的Aggressive代理获得最高胜率88.3%，显著优于ISMCTS（9.0%）和PPO（1.5%），主要通过有效利用Jhyap声明获胜。

Conclusion: 研究贡献了可复现的AI框架，揭示了启发式方法在不完全信息下的有效性，并提供了开源代码，推动了AI研究和文化遗产游戏的数字保存。

Abstract: This study evaluates Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents for Dhumbal, a
culturally significant multiplayer card game with imperfect information,
through a systematic comparison of rule-based, search-based, and learning-based
strategies. We formalize Dhumbal's mechanics and implement diverse agents,
including heuristic approaches (Aggressive, Conservative, Balanced,
Opportunistic), search-based methods such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and
Information Set Monte Carlo Tree Search (ISMCTS), and reinforcement learning
approaches including Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO), and a random baseline. Evaluation involves within-category tournaments
followed by a cross-category championship. Performance is measured via win
rate, economic outcome, Jhyap success, cards discarded per round, risk
assessment, and decision efficiency. Statistical significance is assessed using
Welch's t-test with Bonferroni correction, effect sizes via Cohen's d, and 95%
confidence intervals (CI). Across 1024 simulated rounds, the rule-based
Aggressive agent achieves the highest win rate (88.3%, 95% CI: [86.3, 90.3]),
outperforming ISMCTS (9.0%) and PPO (1.5%) through effective exploitation of
Jhyap declarations. The study contributes a reproducible AI framework, insights
into heuristic efficacy under partial information, and open-source code,
thereby advancing AI research and supporting digital preservation of cultural
games.

### [237] [Tensor Logic: The Language of AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12269)
*Pedro Domingos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出张量逻辑语言，统一神经和符号AI，通过张量方程实现逻辑规则与爱因斯坦求和的统一，支持转换器、形式推理、核机器和图形模型等关键AI形式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI发展缺乏具备所有必要特性的编程语言，PyTorch和TensorFlow缺乏自动推理和知识获取支持，而LISP和Prolog缺乏可扩展性和学习支持。

Method: 基于张量方程构建张量逻辑语言，将逻辑规则和爱因斯坦求和视为相同操作，所有其他功能都可简化为这两种操作。

Result: 优雅实现了神经、符号和统计AI的关键形式，包括转换器、形式推理、核机器和图形模型，并支持嵌入空间中的可靠推理。

Conclusion: 张量逻辑结合了神经网络的可扩展性和可学习性与符号推理的可靠性和透明度，可能成为AI更广泛采用的基础。

Abstract: Progress in AI is hindered by the lack of a programming language with all the
requisite features. Libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow provide automatic
differentiation and efficient GPU implementation, but are additions to Python,
which was never intended for AI. Their lack of support for automated reasoning
and knowledge acquisition has led to a long and costly series of hacky attempts
to tack them on. On the other hand, AI languages like LISP an Prolog lack
scalability and support for learning. This paper proposes tensor logic, a
language that solves these problems by unifying neural and symbolic AI at a
fundamental level. The sole construct in tensor logic is the tensor equation,
based on the observation that logical rules and Einstein summation are
essentially the same operation, and all else can be reduced to them. I show how
to elegantly implement key forms of neural, symbolic and statistical AI in
tensor logic, including transformers, formal reasoning, kernel machines and
graphical models. Most importantly, tensor logic makes new directions possible,
such as sound reasoning in embedding space. This combines the scalability and
learnability of neural networks with the reliability and transparency of
symbolic reasoning, and is potentially a basis for the wider adoption of AI.

*Suryaansh Jain,Umair Z. Ahmed,Shubham Sahai,Ben Leong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM评估器存在严重正向偏差，本文提出少数否决策略和回归框架来缓解此问题，在代码反馈任务上显著提升评估准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM评估器存在系统性正向偏差，虽然能准确识别有效输出，但难以识别无效输出，导致可靠性评分虚高。

Method: 提出少数否决策略和基于回归的框架，利用少量人工标注数据直接建模验证器偏差。

Result: 在366个高中Python程序的代码反馈任务中，回归方法将最大绝对误差降至1.2%，比14个最先进LLM的最佳集成效果提升2倍。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效缓解LLM评估器的正向偏差问题，显著提高评估准确性。

Abstract: New Large Language Models (LLMs) become available every few weeks, and modern
application developers confronted with the unenviable task of having to decide
if they should switch to a new model. While human evaluation remains the gold
standard, it is costly and unscalable. The state-of-the-art approach is to use
LLMs as evaluators ( LLM-as-a-judge), but this suffers from a critical flaw:
LLMs exhibit a strong positive bias. We provide empirical evidence showing that
while LLMs can identify valid outputs with high accuracy (i.e., True Positive
Rate 96%), they are remarkably poor at identifying invalid ones (i.e., True
Negative Rate <25%). This systematic bias, coupled with class imbalance, often
leads to inflated reliability scores.
  While ensemble-based methods like majority voting can help, we show that they
are not good enough. We introduce an optimal minority-veto strategy that is
resilient to missing data and mitigates this bias to a large extent. For
scenarios requiring even higher precision, we propose a novel regression-based
framework that directly models the validator bias using a small set of
human-annotated ground truth data. On a challenging code feedback task over 366
high-school Python programs, our regression approach reduces the maximum
absolute error to just 1.2%, achieving a 2x improvement over the
best-performing ensemble of 14 state-of-the-art LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Holistic Agent Leaderboard (HAL)来解决AI智能体评估中的挑战，包括标准化评估框架、三维分析和LLM辅助日志检查，旨在推动从基准测试表现转向真实世界可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI智能体评估存在诸多挑战，影响对其真实性能的理解，需要更全面和标准化的评估方法。

Method: 1. 标准化评估框架，在数百个VM上并行评估；2. 三维分析（模型、支架、基准）；3. LLM辅助日志检查发现未报告行为。

Result: 执行了21,730次智能体测试，涵盖9个模型和9个基准，发现意外洞察如更高推理努力反而降低准确性，并揭示了智能体的异常行为模式。

Conclusion: 通过标准化评估方法和解决常见评估陷阱，希望推动研究重点从基准测试表现转向真实世界可靠性。

Abstract: AI agents have been developed for complex real-world tasks from coding to
customer service. But AI agent evaluations suffer from many challenges that
undermine our understanding of how well agents really work. We introduce the
Holistic Agent Leaderboard (HAL) to address these challenges. We make three
main contributions. First, we provide a standardized evaluation harness that
orchestrates parallel evaluations across hundreds of VMs, reducing evaluation
time from weeks to hours while eliminating common implementation bugs. Second,
we conduct three-dimensional analysis spanning models, scaffolds, and
benchmarks. We validate the harness by conducting 21,730 agent rollouts across
9 models and 9 benchmarks in coding, web navigation, science, and customer
service with a total cost of about $40,000. Our analysis reveals surprising
insights, such as higher reasoning effort reducing accuracy in the majority of
runs. Third, we use LLM-aided log inspection to uncover previously unreported
behaviors, such as searching for the benchmark on HuggingFace instead of
solving a task, or misusing credit cards in flight booking tasks. We share all
agent logs, comprising 2.5B tokens of language model calls, to incentivize
further research into agent behavior. By standardizing how the field evaluates
agents and addressing common pitfalls in agent evaluation, we hope to shift the
focus from agents that ace benchmarks to agents that work reliably in the real
world.

*Owen Queen,Harrison G. Zhang,James Zou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CGBench是一个用于评估语言模型在科学文献解释能力的基准测试，基于临床遗传学专家标注数据，测试模型在证据提取、强度判断和实验分类方面的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法处理基因变异解释耗时耗力，需要自动化工具来加速临床转化研究。现有基准测试任务过于狭窄，无法反映真实研究需求。

Method: 基于ClinGen专家标注的临床遗传学文献构建CGBench基准，测试8种不同语言模型在三个关键任务上的表现：精确提取实验结果、判断证据强度、分类和描述实验结果。

Result: 模型在文献解释方面表现出潜力但存在明显差距，推理模型在细粒度任务上表现更好，非推理模型在高层次解释上更优。模型即使正确分类证据也经常产生幻觉或误解结果。

Conclusion: CGBench揭示了语言模型在科学文献精确解释方面的优势和局限，为临床遗传学和科学领域的人工智能研究开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Variant and gene interpretation are fundamental to personalized medicine and
translational biomedicine. However, traditional approaches are manual and
labor-intensive. Generative language models (LMs) can facilitate this process,
accelerating the translation of fundamental research into clinically-actionable
insights. While existing benchmarks have attempted to quantify the capabilities
of LMs for interpreting scientific data, these studies focus on narrow tasks
that do not translate to real-world research. To meet these challenges, we
introduce CGBench, a robust benchmark that tests reasoning capabilities of LMs
on scientific publications. CGBench is built from ClinGen, a resource of
expert-curated literature interpretations in clinical genetics. CGBench
measures the ability to 1) extract relevant experimental results following
precise protocols and guidelines, 2) judge the strength of evidence, and 3)
categorize and describe the relevant outcome of experiments. We test 8
different LMs and find that while models show promise, substantial gaps exist
in literature interpretation, especially on fine-grained instructions.
Reasoning models excel in fine-grained tasks but non-reasoning models are
better at high-level interpretations. Finally, we measure LM explanations
against human explanations with an LM judge approach, revealing that models
often hallucinate or misinterpret results even when correctly classifying
evidence. CGBench reveals strengths and weaknesses of LMs for precise
interpretation of scientific publications, opening avenues for future research
in AI for clinical genetics and science more broadly.

TL;DR: 提出基于包容性适应度的多智能体强化学习框架，通过基因共享和遗传相似性驱动的奖励机制，模拟自然选择中的竞争与合作力量，在囚徒困境网络游戏中验证了汉密尔顿法则等生物学原理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受自然选择中竞争与合作力量驱动智力进化的启发，旨在创建能够模拟生物进化社会动态的多智能体系统，超越传统二元团队结构，实现基于遗传相似性的连续合作谱系。

Method: 构建多智能体强化学习框架，每个智能体分配基因型，奖励函数基于包容性适应度概念设计，允许基因共享，在囚徒困境网络游戏中研究社会动态。

Result: 实验结果与汉密尔顿法则等生物学原理一致，展示了基于遗传相似性的合作谱系，能够产生非团队型社会动态，如三方关系中复杂的合作与对抗模式。

Conclusion: 基于包容性适应度的奖励机制为更高级战略智能和社交智能体的涌现提供了基础，能够模拟生物进化中的策略军备竞赛和多智能体自动课程学习过程。

Abstract: The competitive and cooperative forces of natural selection have driven the
evolution of intelligence for millions of years, culminating in nature's vast
biodiversity and the complexity of human minds. Inspired by this process, we
propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework where each agent
is assigned a genotype and where reward functions are modelled after the
concept of inclusive fitness. An agent's genetic material may be shared with
other agents, and our inclusive reward function naturally accounts for this. We
study the resulting social dynamics in two types of network games with
prisoner's dilemmas and find that our results align with well-established
principles from biology, such as Hamilton's rule. Furthermore, we outline how
this framework can extend to more open-ended environments with spatial and
temporal structure, finite resources, and evolving populations. We hypothesize
the emergence of an arms race of strategies, where each new strategy is a
gradual improvement over earlier adaptations of other agents, effectively
producing a multi-agent autocurriculum analogous to biological evolution. In
contrast to the binary team-based structures prevalent in earlier research, our
gene-based reward structure introduces a spectrum of cooperation ranging from
full adversity to full cooperativeness based on genetic similarity, enabling
unique non team-based social dynamics. For example, one agent having a mutual
cooperative relationship with two other agents, while the two other agents
behave adversarially towards each other. We argue that incorporating inclusive
fitness in agents provides a foundation for the emergence of more strategically
advanced and socially intelligent agents.

*Ali Montazeralghaem,Guy Tennenholtz,Craig Boutilier,Ofer Meshi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型思想的两阶段训练方法，让LLM学会通过顺序提问来有效获取用户偏好信息，显著提升了提问效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在用户历史数据有限的情况下，如何通过生成有效的顺序澄清问题来获取用户偏好信息，以个性化LLM推荐系统的响应。

Method: 采用两阶段训练过程：前向过程从用户画像生成澄清问题并逐步移除答案作为"噪声"；反向过程训练模型通过提问来"去噪"用户画像。

Result: 该方法显著提高了LLM提出漏斗式问题和有效获取用户偏好的能力。

Conclusion: 基于扩散模型思想的训练方法能够有效提升LLM在顺序提问中获取用户偏好的能力，为个性化推荐系统提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made it possible for recommendation systems
to interact with users in open-ended conversational interfaces. In order to
personalize LLM responses, it is crucial to elicit user preferences, especially
when there is limited user history. One way to get more information is to
present clarifying questions to the user. However, generating effective
sequential clarifying questions across various domains remains a challenge. To
address this, we introduce a novel approach for training LLMs to ask sequential
questions that reveal user preferences. Our method follows a two-stage process
inspired by diffusion models. Starting from a user profile, the forward process
generates clarifying questions to obtain answers and then removes those answers
step by step, serving as a way to add ``noise'' to the user profile. The
reverse process involves training a model to ``denoise'' the user profile by
learning to ask effective clarifying questions. Our results show that our
method significantly improves the LLM's proficiency in asking funnel questions
and eliciting user preferences effectively.

TL;DR: Ax-Prover是一个基于多智能体系统的自动定理证明器，使用LLM提供知识和推理能力，通过MCP协议与Lean工具集成，能在多个科学领域进行定理证明，支持自主和协作两种工作模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统专业定理证明器难以泛化到不同科学领域的问题，通过结合LLM的推理能力和形式化工具的严谨性，实现跨领域的自动定理证明。

Method: 使用大型语言模型提供知识和推理，通过模型上下文协议集成Lean形式化验证工具，构建多智能体系统，支持自主证明和专家协作两种模式。

Result: 在公开数学基准测试中与最先进证明器竞争，在新引入的抽象代数和量子理论基准测试中大幅领先，并成功协助专家数学家形式化复杂密码学定理证明。

Conclusion: 基于工具的智能体定理证明方法为跨领域形式化验证提供了可泛化的方法论，克服了专业系统难以泛化的局限性。

Abstract: We present Ax-Prover, a multi-agent system for automated theorem proving in
Lean that can solve problems across diverse scientific domains and operate
either autonomously or collaboratively with human experts. To achieve this,
Ax-Prover approaches scientific problem solving through formal proof
generation, a process that demands both creative reasoning and strict syntactic
rigor. Ax-Prover meets this challenge by equipping Large Language Models
(LLMs), which provide knowledge and reasoning, with Lean tools via the Model
Context Protocol (MCP), which ensure formal correctness. To evaluate its
performance as an autonomous prover, we benchmark our approach against frontier
LLMs and specialized prover models on two public math benchmarks and on two
Lean benchmarks we introduce in the fields of abstract algebra and quantum
theory. On public datasets, Ax-Prover is competitive with state-of-the-art
provers, while it largely outperform them on the new benchmarks. This shows
that, unlike specialized systems that struggle to generalize, our tool-based
agentic theorem prover approach offers a generalizable methodology for formal
verification across diverse scientific domains. Furthermore, we demonstrate
Ax-Prover's assistant capabilities in a practical use case, showing how it
enabled an expert mathematician to formalize the proof of a complex
cryptography theorem.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CausalTrace是一个集成到工业CoPilot中的神经符号因果分析模块，通过数据驱动的因果分析结合工业本体和知识图谱，提供因果发现、反事实推理和根本原因分析等功能，实现透明可解释的决策支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代制造环境不仅需要准确预测，还需要对过程异常、根本原因和潜在干预提供可解释的见解。现有AI系统往往作为孤立的黑盒运行，缺乏预测、解释和因果推理的无缝集成，限制了在高风险工业环境中的可信度和实用性。

Method: CausalTrace是一个神经符号因果分析模块，集成到SmartPilot工业CoPilot中。它执行数据驱动的因果分析，并通过工业本体和知识图谱进行丰富，支持因果发现、反事实推理和根本原因分析等高级功能。

Result: 在学术火箭组装测试平台上，CausalTrace与领域专家达成高度一致（本体问答ROUGE-1：0.91），RCA性能强劲（MAP@3：94%，PR@2：97%，MRR：0.92，Jaccard：0.92）。在C3AN评估中获得4.59/5分，展示了实时部署的精确性和可靠性。

Conclusion: CausalTrace成功地将预测、解释和因果推理集成到统一的决策支持解决方案中，通过神经符号方法提供了透明可解释的工业AI系统，显著提升了在制造环境中的可信度和实用性。

Abstract: Modern manufacturing environments demand not only accurate predictions but
also interpretable insights to process anomalies, root causes, and potential
interventions. Existing AI systems often function as isolated black boxes,
lacking the seamless integration of prediction, explanation, and causal
reasoning required for a unified decision-support solution. This fragmentation
limits their trustworthiness and practical utility in high-stakes industrial
environments. In this work, we present CausalTrace, a neurosymbolic causal
analysis module integrated into the SmartPilot industrial CoPilot. CausalTrace
performs data-driven causal analysis enriched by industrial ontologies and
knowledge graphs, including advanced functions such as causal discovery,
counterfactual reasoning, and root cause analysis (RCA). It supports real-time
operator interaction and is designed to complement existing agents by offering
transparent, explainable decision support. We conducted a comprehensive
evaluation of CausalTrace using multiple causal assessment methods and the C3AN
framework (i.e. Custom, Compact, Composite AI with Neurosymbolic Integration),
which spans principles of robustness, intelligence, and trustworthiness. In an
academic rocket assembly testbed, CausalTrace achieved substantial agreement
with domain experts (ROUGE-1: 0.91 in ontology QA) and strong RCA performance
(MAP@3: 94%, PR@2: 97%, MRR: 0.92, Jaccard: 0.92). It also attained 4.59/5 in
the C3AN evaluation, demonstrating precision and reliability for live
deployment.

TL;DR: PACT是一个评估LLM生成代码合同遵从性的框架，扩展了HumanEval+和MBPP+基准，通过合同违反测试用例增强模型对合同约束的理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成基准主要评估功能性正确性，忽略了真实软件中合同约束的重要性，无法衡量模型处理异常输入的能力。

Method: 构建包含合同违反测试用例的测试套件，分析不同提示条件下代码生成效果，引入新指标量化合同遵从性。

Result: 在提示中加入合同违反测试用例能显著提升模型对合同的遵从性，相比仅使用合同描述效果更好。

Conclusion: PACT提供了评估LLM生成代码在功能和合同遵从性两方面鲁棒性的严格可解释指标，揭示了传统基准忽略的关键错误。

Abstract: Prevailing code generation benchmarks, such as HumanEval+ and MBPP+,
primarily evaluate large language models (LLMs) with pass@k on functional
correctness using well-formed inputs. However, they ignore a crucial aspect of
real-world software: adherence to contracts-the preconditions and validity
constraints that dictate how ill-formed inputs must be rejected. This critical
oversight means that existing benchmarks fail to measure, and models
consequently fail to generate, truly robust and reliable code snippets. We
introduce PACT, a program assessment and contract-adherence evaluation
framework, to bridge this gap. PACT is the first framework designed to
systematically evaluate and enhance contract-adherence in LLM-generated code
snippets alongside functional correctness. PACT's contributions are threefold:
First, it provides a comprehensive test-suite corpus focused on contract
violations, extending HumanEval+ and MBPP+. Second, it enables a systematic
analysis of code generation under varied prompting conditions. This analysis
demonstrates that augmenting prompts with contract-violating test cases
significantly enhance a model's ability to respect contracts compared to using
contract description alone. Finally, it introduces novel metrics to rigorously
quantify contract adherence in both test generation and code generation. By
revealing critical errors that conventional benchmarks overlook, PACT provides
the rigorous and interpretable metrics to evaluate the robustness of
LLM-generated code snippets in both functionality and contract-adherence.Our
code and data are available at https://github.com/suhanmen/PACT.

TL;DR: 提出了一个地理空间感知层(GAL)，通过将大语言模型与结构化地球数据相结合，提升灾害响应能力，在真实野火场景中表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有统计方法缺乏语义上下文、跨事件泛化能力差且可解释性有限，而大语言模型虽然具有少样本泛化能力，但受限于文本且对地理信息不敏感。

Method: 引入地理空间感知层(GAL)，从原始野火检测出发，自动从外部地理数据库中检索并整合基础设施、人口统计、地形和天气信息，组装成简洁的带单位注释的感知脚本。

Result: 在多个LLM模型上的真实野火场景评估显示，地理空间接地的智能体能够超越基线方法，产生基于证据的资源分配建议。

Conclusion: 该框架能够推广到其他灾害如洪水和飓风，为灾害响应提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Effective disaster response is essential for safeguarding lives and property.
Existing statistical approaches often lack semantic context, generalize poorly
across events, and offer limited interpretability. While Large language models
(LLMs) provide few-shot generalization, they remain text-bound and blind to
geography. To bridge this gap, we introduce a Geospatial Awareness Layer (GAL)
that grounds LLM agents in structured earth data. Starting from raw wildfire
detections, GAL automatically retrieves and integrates infrastructure,
demographic, terrain, and weather information from external geodatabases,
assembling them into a concise, unit-annotated perception script. This enriched
context enables agents to produce evidence-based resource-allocation
recommendations (e.g., personnel assignments, budget allocations), further
reinforced by historical analogs and daily change signals for incremental
updates. We evaluate the framework in real wildfire scenarios across multiple
LLM models, showing that geospatially grounded agents can outperform baselines.
The proposed framework can generalize to other hazards such as floods and
hurricanes.

*Sunzhu Li,Zhiyu Lin,Shuling Yang,Jiale Zhao,Wei Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ThinkPilot是一个无需训练即可自动优化大型推理模型推理过程的框架，通过进化过程生成think-prefixes来指导模型获得更好的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型虽然强大，但仍存在推理效率低下和偏离目标的问题。现有的免训练方法要么依赖僵化的启发式规则，要么只能提供描述性但不可操作的分析。

Method: 使用进化过程生成think-prefixes（思考前缀），这些前缀指令在推理行为分类学的驱动下演化，引导模型朝着更优性能发展。

Result: ThinkPilot显著改善了准确率与推理长度的权衡关系，大幅提升了安全性（如将DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B的StrongREJECT分数从27.0%降至0.7），并增强了指令遵循能力。

Conclusion: think-prefixes能够可靠地控制大型推理模型的推理行为，不同任务对特定行为分布有强烈偏好。ThinkPilot通过自动识别和激发这些行为，为将模型推理与任务需求对齐提供了通用框架。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are powerful, but they still suffer from
inefficient and off-target reasoning. Currently, training-free methods are
limited to either rigid heuristics or descriptive, non-actionable analyses. In
this paper, we introduce ThinkPilot, a training-free framework that
automatically optimizes LRMs reasoning. It uses an evolutionary process to
generate think-prefixes, which are instructions that evolve driven by a
taxonomy of reasoning behaviors to guide models toward superior performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate ThinkPilot's broad effectiveness: it
significantly improves the accuracy-length trade-off for efficient reasoning,
drastically improves safety (for example, cutting the StrongREJECT score of
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B from 27.0% to 0.7), and enhances instruction
following. It also synergizes with existing training-based methods. Our
analysis reveals that think-prefixes can reliably control LRMs' reasoning
behaviors, and that different tasks have strong preferences for specific
behavioral distributions. By automatically identifying and eliciting these
behaviors, ThinkPilot provides a generalizable framework for aligning LRMs
reasoning with task demands. Data and code are available at

### [248] [AI Agents as Universal Task Solvers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12066)
*Alessandro Achille,Stefano Soatto*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文重新思考了AI智能体中的学习角色，将其视为具有计算能力的随机动力系统，强调时间在学习推理中的关键作用。提出了从归纳学习转向转导学习的范式转变，认为信息的关键作用是减少时间而非降低重构误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI推理智能体是否具有通用性，能否解决任何可计算任务，以及学习推理的本质是什么。质疑模型大小或训练数据集大小是否是关键因素，强调时间在学习过程中的核心作用。

Method: 将AI智能体重新解释为具有计算能力的随机动力系统，提出转导学习范式，关注捕获数据的算法结构以减少解决新任务所需的时间。理论分析了通用求解器使用过去数据实现的最优加速与算法信息的关系。

Result: 理论推导了推理时间与训练时间之间的幂律缩放关系。发现模型规模扩展可能导致虽然基准测试准确率提高，但缺乏真正智能的行为——在无限空间和时间下，大模型可能像学者症候群一样暴力求解任务而无洞察力。

Conclusion: 在扩展推理模型时，需要优化的关键量是时间，而非仅仅模型大小。时间在学习中的关键作用至今只被间接考虑，应成为未来AI推理系统设计的核心考量因素。

Abstract: AI reasoning agents are already able to solve a variety of tasks by deploying
tools, simulating outcomes of multiple hypotheses and reflecting on them. In
doing so, they perform computation, although not in the classical sense --
there is no program being executed. Still, if they perform computation, can AI
agents be universal? Can chain-of-thought reasoning solve any computable task?
How does an AI Agent learn to reason? Is it a matter of model size? Or training
dataset size?
  In this work, we reinterpret the role of learning in the context of AI
Agents, viewing them as compute-capable stochastic dynamical systems, and
highlight the role of time in a foundational principle for learning to reason.
In doing so, we propose a shift from classical inductive learning to
transductive learning -- where the objective is not to approximate the
distribution of past data, but to capture their algorithmic structure to reduce
the time needed to find solutions to new tasks.
  Transductive learning suggests that, counter to Shannon's theory, a key role
of information in learning is about reduction of time rather than
reconstruction error. In particular, we show that the optimal speed-up that a
universal solver can achieve using past data is tightly related to their
algorithmic information. Using this, we show a theoretical derivation for the
observed power-law scaling of inference time versus training time. We then show
that scaling model size can lead to behaviors that, while improving accuracy on
benchmarks, fail any reasonable test of intelligence, let alone
super-intelligence: In the limit of infinite space and time, large models can
behave as savants, able to brute-force through any task without any insight.
Instead, we argue that the key quantity to optimize when scaling reasoning
models is time, whose critical role in learning has so far only been indirectly
considered.

*Junyi Xie,Yuankun Jiao,Jina Kim,Yao-Yi Chiang,Lingyi Zhao,Khurram Shafique*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HiCoTraj是一个零样本人口统计推理框架，利用大语言模型的语义理解能力从人类移动轨迹中推断年龄、性别等人口属性，无需标注训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于移动轨迹的人口统计推断方法严重依赖带标注的大规模轨迹数据，导致可解释性差且跨数据集泛化能力弱。

Method: 将轨迹转化为语义丰富的自然语言表示，通过分层思维链推理引导LLMs完成三个认知阶段：事实特征提取、行为模式分析和结构化输出的人口统计推断。

Result: 在真实世界轨迹数据上的实验评估表明，HiCoTraj在零样本场景下对多种人口属性都取得了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: HiCoTraj解决了标注人口统计数据稀缺的挑战，同时提供了透明的推理链，具有良好的可解释性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Inferring demographic attributes such as age, sex, or income level from human
mobility patterns enables critical applications such as targeted public health
interventions, equitable urban planning, and personalized transportation
services. Existing mobility-based demographic inference studies heavily rely on
large-scale trajectory data with demographic labels, leading to limited
interpretability and poor generalizability across different datasets and user
groups. We propose HiCoTraj (Zero-Shot Demographic Reasoning via Hierarchical
Chain-of-Thought Prompting from Trajectory), a framework that leverages LLMs'
zero-shot learning and semantic understanding capabilities to perform
demographic inference without labeled training data. HiCoTraj transforms
trajectories into semantically rich, natural language representations by
creating detailed activity chronicles and multi-scale visiting summaries. Then
HiCoTraj uses a novel hierarchical chain of thought reasoning to systematically
guide LLMs through three cognitive stages: factual feature extraction,
behavioral pattern analysis, and demographic inference with structured output.
This approach addresses the scarcity challenge of labeled demographic data
while providing transparent reasoning chains. Experimental evaluation on
real-world trajectory data demonstrates that HiCoTraj achieves competitive
performance across multiple demographic attributes in zero-shot scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM缺乏物理环境暴露的问题，使其能够真正理解具身决策，实现通用具身智能。

Method: 构建EmboMatrix训练场，包含多智能体数据引擎生成大规模任务场景、分布式异构硬件系统进行可扩展模拟、多层次奖励架构提供精确监督。

Result: 训练出的EmboBrain-7B模型在两个具身决策基准上超越671B的DeepSeek-R1基线9.5%。

Conclusion: 交互式、环境基础的学习对于构建真正智能的具身代理具有强大潜力。

Abstract: Embodied decision-making enables agents to translate high-level goals into
executable actions through continuous interactions within the physical world,
forming a cornerstone of general-purpose embodied intelligence. Large language
models (LLMs), with their general decision-making capabilities, offer a
promising path to realize this potential; however, LLMs trained solely on
language lack exposure to physical environments, limiting their true embodied
understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose the concept of a training ground:
a comprehensive infrastructure that provides task and scene simulation,
embodied interaction, and feedback signals, offering a one-stop solution for
LLM acquire genuine embodied decision-making skills. In this work, we present
EmboMatrix, the first training ground of its kind, providing massive and
diverse tasks with efficient simulation and precise rewards. EmboMatrix
incorporates a series of novel techniques: a multi-agent data engine for
large-scale task and scene generation, a distributed heterogeneous-hardware
system for scalable simulation, and a multi-level reward architecture for
precise supervision. Leveraging EmboMatrix, we cultivate EmboBrain, an LLM
whose embodied decision-making abilities emerge from extensive embodied
interactions. Experiments show that EmboBrain-7B surpasses the 671B DeepSeek-R1
baseline by 9.5\% on two challenging embodied decision-making benchmarks,
demonstrating the power of interactive, environment-grounded learning for
building truly intelligent embodied agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BeSTAD是一个无监督框架，通过联合建模空间上下文和时间动态来检测人类移动数据中的个体级异常，能够从大规模未标记数据中学习个体化行为特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统异常检测主要关注轨迹级分析，而检测个体相对于自身历史模式的异常行为在大规模人群中仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 学习语义丰富的移动表示，整合位置含义和时间模式，采用行为聚类感知建模机制构建个性化行为档案，通过跨时期行为比较识别异常。

Result: 能够检测个体移动行为中的细微偏差，识别行为转变和偏离既定常规的情况，在大规模移动数据集中定位异常个体。

Conclusion: BeSTAD通过直接从无标签数据学习个体行为，将异常检测推向个性化和可解释的移动分析。

Abstract: Traditional anomaly detection in human mobility has primarily focused on
trajectory-level analysis, identifying statistical outliers or spatiotemporal
inconsistencies across aggregated movement traces. However, detecting
individual-level anomalies, i.e., unusual deviations in a person's mobility
behavior relative to their own historical patterns, within datasets
encompassing large populations remains a significant challenge. In this paper,
we present BeSTAD (Behavior-aware Spatio-Temporal Anomaly Detection for Human
Mobility Data), an unsupervised framework that captures individualized
behavioral signatures across large populations and uncovers fine-grained
anomalies by jointly modeling spatial context and temporal dynamics. BeSTAD
learns semantically enriched mobility representations that integrate location
meaning and temporal patterns, enabling the detection of subtle deviations in
individual movement behavior. BeSTAD further employs a behavior-cluster-aware
modeling mechanism that builds personalized behavioral profiles from normal
activity and identifies anomalies through cross-period behavioral comparison
with consistent semantic alignment. Building on prior work in mobility behavior
clustering, this approach enables not only the detection of behavioral shifts
and deviations from established routines but also the identification of
individuals exhibiting such changes within large-scale mobility datasets. By
learning individual behaviors directly from unlabeled data, BeSTAD advances
anomaly detection toward personalized and interpretable mobility analysis.

*Rabimba Karanjai,Yang Lu,Ranjith Chodavarapu,Lei Xu,Weidong Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大语言模型处理随机性任务的能力，发现虽然LLM能生成具有一定随机性的输出，但表现不稳定且与预期行为存在显著偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的快速发展，许多应用需要随机性（如随机决策、游戏、调度等），但LLM处理随机性的能力尚不明确，需要系统评估。

Method: 设计了一系列实验，考虑外部工具可访问性、任务类型、模型状态（新鲜vs非新鲜）和提示策略等因素，涵盖生成随机数、随机字符串、项目洗牌等任务，并使用熵和NIST随机性测试套件评估随机性质量。

Result: LLM生成的输出虽然表现出一定程度的随机性，但性能不一致，往往与预期行为显著偏离。

Conclusion: LLM在处理涉及随机性的任务时存在关键局限性，需要在多个方面进行改进才能有效处理此类任务。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language model (LLM) technology has led to
diverse applications, many of which inherently require randomness, such as
stochastic decision-making, gaming, scheduling, AI agents, and
cryptography-related tasks. However, the capabilities of LLMs in handling
randomness, particularly in generating and utilizing random numbers
effectively, remain unclear. This paper investigates the capacity of LLMs for
handling tasks that involve randomness through a series of experiments. We
designed a set of experiments that consider various factors that can influence
an LLM's performance in tasks involving randomness, such as accessibility to
external tools, types of tasks, model states (fresh vs. non-fresh), and
prompting strategies. The experiments cover a range of tasks, including
generating random numbers, generating random strings such as passwords,
shuffling items, and evaluating the quality of randomness using entropy and the
NIST randomness test-suite. Our findings reveal that while LLMs can generate
outputs that exhibit some degree of randomness, their performance is
inconsistent and often deviates significantly from the expected behavior. The
analysis of the experimental results highlights key limitations and areas where
improvement is needed for the LLMs to effectively handle tasks involving
randomness

Motivation: 解决在复杂、随机环境中，代理只有"一次生命"探索敌对环境且无人指导的现实挑战性场景下的符号世界建模问题。

Method: 使用条件激活的程序化法则，每个法则通过前置条件-效果结构运作，在相关世界状态中激活，创建动态计算图，仅通过相关法则进行推理和优化。

Result: 在23个测试场景中的16个场景上优于强基线，能够从最少、无指导的交互中成功学习关键环境动态，模拟推演成功识别出更优策略。

Conclusion: 为自主构建未知复杂环境的程序化世界模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Symbolic world modeling requires inferring and representing an environment's
transitional dynamics as an executable program. Prior work has focused on
largely deterministic environments with abundant interaction data, simple
mechanics, and human guidance. We address a more realistic and challenging
setting, learning in a complex, stochastic environment where the agent has only
"one life" to explore a hostile environment without human guidance. We
introduce OneLife, a framework that models world dynamics through
conditionally-activated programmatic laws within a probabilistic programming
framework. Each law operates through a precondition-effect structure,
activating in relevant world states. This creates a dynamic computation graph
that routes inference and optimization only through relevant laws, avoiding
scaling challenges when all laws contribute to predictions about a complex,
hierarchical state, and enabling the learning of stochastic dynamics even with
sparse rule activation. To evaluate our approach under these demanding
constraints, we introduce a new evaluation protocol that measures (a) state
ranking, the ability to distinguish plausible future states from implausible
ones, and (b) state fidelity, the ability to generate future states that
closely resemble reality. We develop and evaluate our framework on Crafter-OO,
our reimplementation of the Crafter environment that exposes a structured,
object-oriented symbolic state and a pure transition function that operates on
that state alone. OneLife can successfully learn key environment dynamics from
minimal, unguided interaction, outperforming a strong baseline on 16 out of 23
scenarios tested. We also test OneLife's planning ability, with simulated
rollouts successfully identifying superior strategies. Our work establishes a
foundation for autonomously constructing programmatic world models of unknown,
complex environments.

Abstract: We introduce ToPolyAgent, a multi-agent AI framework for performing
coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of topological polymers
through natural language instructions. By integrating large language models
(LLMs) with domain-specific computational tools, ToPolyAgent supports both
interactive and autonomous simulation workflows across diverse polymer
architectures, including linear, ring, brush, and star polymers, as well as
dendrimers. The system consists of four LLM-powered agents: a Config Agent for
generating initial polymer-solvent configurations, a Simulation Agent for
executing LAMMPS-based MD simulations and conformational analyses, a Report
Agent for compiling markdown reports, and a Workflow Agent for streamlined
autonomous operations. Interactive mode incorporates user feedback loops for
iterative refinements, while autonomous mode enables end-to-end task execution
from detailed prompts. We demonstrate ToPolyAgent's versatility through case
studies involving diverse polymer architectures under varying solvent
condition, thermostats, and simulation lengths. Furthermore, we highlight its
potential as a research assistant by directing it to investigate the effect of
interaction parameters on the linear polymer conformation, and the influence of
grafting density on the persistence length of the brush polymer. By coupling
natural language interfaces with rigorous simulation tools, ToPolyAgent lowers
barriers to complex computational workflows and advances AI-driven materials
discovery in polymer science. It lays the foundation for autonomous and
extensible multi-agent scientific research ecosystems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM对齐方法只能提供方向性或开放式指导，无法可靠实现精确的属性强度控制，这限制了AI系统适应不同用户期望的能力。

Method: 1) 将精确属性强度控制重新定义为目标达成问题；2) 通过时序差分学习训练轻量级价值函数来预测部分生成的最终属性强度分数；3) 在隐藏表示上应用基于梯度的干预来精确导航模型达到特定属性强度目标。

Result: 在LLaMA-3.2-3b和Phi-4-mini上的实验证实了该方法能够以高精度将文本生成引导到用户指定的属性强度。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了对属性强度的细粒度连续控制，超越了简单的方向对齐，并在偏好数据合成、帕累托前沿近似和优化以及对齐行为蒸馏等下游任务中展示了效率提升。

Abstract: Precise attribute intensity control--generating Large Language Model (LLM)
outputs with specific, user-defined attribute intensities--is crucial for AI
systems adaptable to diverse user expectations. Current LLM alignment methods,
however, typically provide only directional or open-ended guidance, failing to
reliably achieve exact attribute intensities. We address this limitation with
three key designs: (1) reformulating precise attribute intensity control as a
target-reaching problem, rather than simple maximization; (2) training a
lightweight value function via temporal-difference learning to predict final
attribute intensity scores from partial generations, thereby steering LLM
outputs; and (3) employing gradient-based interventions on hidden
representations to navigate the model precisely towards specific attribute
intensity targets. Our method enables fine-grained, continuous control over
attribute intensities, moving beyond simple directional alignment. Experiments
on LLaMA-3.2-3b and Phi-4-mini confirm our method's ability to steer text
generation to user-specified attribute intensities with high accuracy. Finally,
we demonstrate efficiency enhancements across three downstream tasks:
preference data synthesis, Pareto frontier approximation and optimization, and
distillation of aligned behaviors for intervention-free inference. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在科学推理方面表现出色，但在材料科学领域的推理能力尚未得到充分探索，因此需要建立一个全面的基准来评估和推动LLMs在该领域的进步。

Method: 构建MatSciBench基准，包含1340个结构化问题，采用三级难度分类，提供详细参考解决方案，并整合多模态推理。评估了多种推理策略：基础思维链、工具增强和自我纠正。

Result: 评估结果显示，即使是表现最佳的Gemini-2.5-Pro模型在材料科学问题上的准确率也不到80%。没有单一推理方法在所有场景中都表现优异，多模态推理任务存在挑战。

Conclusion: MatSciBench为评估和提升LLMs在材料科学领域的科学推理能力建立了一个全面而坚实的基准，揭示了当前模型在该领域的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in
scientific reasoning, yet their reasoning capabilities in materials science
remain underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce MatSciBench, a
comprehensive college-level benchmark comprising 1,340 problems that span the
essential subdisciplines of materials science. MatSciBench features a
structured and fine-grained taxonomy that categorizes materials science
questions into 6 primary fields and 31 sub-fields, and includes a three-tier
difficulty classification based on the reasoning length required to solve each
question. MatSciBench provides detailed reference solutions enabling precise
error analysis and incorporates multimodal reasoning through visual contexts in
numerous questions. Evaluations of leading models reveal that even the
highest-performing model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves under 80% accuracy on
college-level materials science questions, highlighting the complexity of
MatSciBench. Our systematic analysis of different reasoning strategie--basic
chain-of-thought, tool augmentation, and self-correction--demonstrates that no
single method consistently excels across all scenarios. We further analyze
performance by difficulty level, examine trade-offs between efficiency and
accuracy, highlight the challenges inherent in multimodal reasoning tasks,
analyze failure modes across LLMs and reasoning methods, and evaluate the
influence of retrieval-augmented generation. MatSciBench thus establishes a
comprehensive and solid benchmark for assessing and driving improvements in the
scientific reasoning capabilities of LLMs within the materials science domain.

parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods developed for these models. We
first describe the LLaMA family of foundation models (7B-65B to 288B
parameters), their architectures (including native multimodal and
Mixtureof-Experts variants), and key performance characteristics. We then
describe and discuss the concept of PEFT, which adapts large pre-trained models
by updating only a small subset of parameters, and review five PEFT methods
that have been applied to LLaMA: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), LLaMA-Adapter V1
and V2, LLaMA-Excitor, and QLoRA (Quantized LoRA). We discuss each method's
mechanism, parameter savings, and example application to LLaMA (e.g.,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在日常生活中的普及，对既高性能又可理解的智能系统需求日益增长。当前XAI系统的评估过程过于技术化，未能充分关注人类用户的需求，因此需要开展以用户为中心的研究来指导XAI开发。

Method: 通过对65项XAI用户研究的全面综述，分析XAI系统特性和评估指标，提出以人为中心的设计目标，并根据用户AI专业知识水平（AI新手和数据专家）进行差异化设计。

Result: 研究发现XAI系统由核心系统和解释功能共同构成；评估指标可分为系统情感、认知、可用性、可解释性和解释指标；针对AI新手的设计目标包括负责任使用、接受度和可用性，针对数据专家的设计目标则侧重于人机协作和任务性能。

Conclusion: 本文扩展了现有的XAI评估和设计框架，为XAI开发者提供了以用户为中心的指导原则，强调需要根据用户专业知识水平进行差异化设计，以更好地满足不同用户群体的需求。

Abstract: As AI becomes more common in everyday living, there is an increasing demand
for intelligent systems that are both performant and understandable.
Explainable AI (XAI) systems aim to provide comprehensible explanations of
decisions and predictions. At present, however, evaluation processes are rather
technical and not sufficiently focused on the needs of human users.
Consequently, evaluation studies involving human users can serve as a valuable
guide for conducting user studies. This paper presents a comprehensive review
of 65 user studies evaluating XAI systems across different domains and
application contexts. As a guideline for XAI developers, we provide a holistic
overview of the properties of XAI systems and evaluation metrics focused on
human users (human-centered). We propose objectives for the human-centered
design (design goals) of XAI systems. To incorporate users' specific
characteristics, design goals are adapted to users with different levels of AI
expertise (AI novices and data experts). In this regard, we provide an
extension to existing XAI evaluation and design frameworks. The first part of
our results includes the analysis of XAI system characteristics. An important
finding is the distinction between the core system and the XAI explanation,
which together form the whole system. Further results include the distinction
of evaluation metrics into affection towards the system, cognition, usability,
interpretability, and explanation metrics. Furthermore, the users, along with
their specific characteristics and behavior, can be assessed. For AI novices,
the relevant extended design goals include responsible use, acceptance, and
usability. For data experts, the focus is performance-oriented and includes
human-AI collaboration and system and user task performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理在处理需要分解高层次目标为多个相互依赖API调用的目标导向查询时能力有限，特别是开源模型表现不佳，而缺乏训练数据是主要原因。

Method: 提出GOAT框架，自动从API文档构建合成数据集，训练LLM代理进行目标导向的API执行，使其能够推理相互依赖的调用并生成连贯响应。

Result: GOAT训练的代理在多个现有目标导向基准测试中达到最先进性能，并在新提出的GOATBench基准测试中表现出色。

Conclusion: GOAT为构建能够进行复杂推理和工具使用的稳健开源LLM代理提供了一条实用路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been extended beyond traditional
text generation to serve as interactive agents capable of using external tools
based on user intent. However, current LLM agents still show limited ability to
handle goal-oriented queries, which require decomposing a high-level objective
into multiple interdependent API calls with correct planning and execution.
Current approaches mainly rely on zero-shot evaluation due to the absence of
training data. While proprietary closed-source models such as GPT-4 demonstrate
strong reasoning abilities, smaller open-source models struggle to perform
complex tool use effectively. Thus, we propose a novel training framework GOAT,
which enables fine-tuning of LLM agents in a human annotation-free setting.
GOAT automatically constructs synthetic datasets of goal-oriented API execution
tasks directly from given API documents, equipping models with the ability to
reason over interdependent calls and generate coherent responses. Through
extensive experiments, we show that GOAT-trained agents achieve
state-of-the-art performance across multiple existing goal-oriented benchmarks.
In addition, we introduce GOATBench, a new goal-oriented API execution
benchmark, and demonstrate that agents trained with GOAT also excel in this
setting. These results highlight GOAT as a practical path toward building
robust open-source LLM agents capable of complex reasoning and tool use.

Conclusion: MedKGEval提供了一个有效的多轮评估框架，能够更好地评估临床LLMs在真实医疗环境中的表现，且支持中英文并可扩展到其他语言。

Abstract: The reliable evaluation of large language models (LLMs) in medical
applications remains an open challenge, particularly in capturing the
complexity of multi-turn doctor-patient interactions that unfold in real
clinical environments. Existing evaluation methods typically rely on post hoc
review of full conversation transcripts, thereby neglecting the dynamic,
context-sensitive nature of medical dialogues and the evolving informational
needs of patients. In this work, we present MedKGEval, a novel multi-turn
evaluation framework for clinical LLMs grounded in structured medical
knowledge. Our approach introduces three key contributions: (1) a knowledge
graph-driven patient simulation mechanism, where a dedicated control module
retrieves relevant medical facts from a curated knowledge graph, thereby
endowing the patient agent with human-like and realistic conversational
behavior. This knowledge graph is constructed by integrating open-source
resources with additional triples extracted from expert-annotated datasets; (2)
an in-situ, turn-level evaluation framework, where each model response is
assessed by a Judge Agent for clinical appropriateness, factual correctness,
and safety as the dialogue progresses using a suite of fine-grained,
task-specific metrics; (3) a comprehensive multi-turn benchmark of eight
state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating MedKGEval's ability to identify subtle
behavioral flaws and safety risks that are often overlooked by conventional
evaluation pipelines. Although initially designed for Chinese and English
medical applications, our framework can be readily extended to additional
languages by switching the input knowledge graphs, ensuring seamless bilingual
support and domain-specific applicability.

*Jingyi Wang,Hongyuan Zhu,Ye Niu,Yunhui Deng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了PromptFlow框架，一个受TensorFlow启发的模块化训练框架，通过元学习自动优化提示工程，减少对人工设计提示的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前自动提示工程方法缺乏动态策略选择和精细粒度编辑的问题，以及LLM在提示工程中经验回收利用不足的挑战。

Method: 设计基于强化学习的方法来回收LLM在提示工程过程中的经验，通过梯度元学习自主探索最优提示优化轨迹。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验证明了PromptFlow框架的有效性。

Conclusion: PromptFlow提供了一个高效且数据需求低的提示工程自动化解决方案，能够显著提升LLM在特定领域的适应能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated profound impact on Natural
Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, their effective deployment across
diverse domains often require domain-specific adaptation strategies, as generic
models may underperform when faced with specialized data distributions. Recent
advances in prompt engineering (PE) offer a promising alternative to extensive
retraining by refining input instructions to align LLM outputs with task
objectives. This paradigm has emerged as a rapid and versatile approach for
model fine-tuning. Despite its potential, manual prompt design remains
labor-intensive and heavily depends on specialized expertise, often requiring
iterative human effort to achieve optimal formulations. To address this
limitation, automated prompt engineering methodologies have been developed to
systematically generate task-specific prompts. However, current implementations
predominantly employ static update rules and lack mechanisms for dynamic
strategy selection, resulting in suboptimal adaptation to varying NLP task
requirements. Furthermore, most methods treat and update the whole prompts at
each step, without considering editing prompt sections at a finer granularity.
At last, in particular, the problem of how to recycle experience in LLM is
still underexplored. To this end, we propose the PromptFlow, a modular training
framework inspired by TensorFlow, which integrates meta-prompts, operators,
optimization, and evaluator. Our framework can be equipped with the latest
optimization methods and autonomously explores optimal prompt refinement
trajectories through gradient-based meta-learning, requiring minimal
task-specific training data. Specifically, we devise a reinforcement learning
method to recycle experience for LLM in the PE process. Finally, we conduct
extensive experiments on various datasets, and demonstrate the effectiveness of
PromptFlow.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了T³方法，通过检测信念偏差并截断训练轨迹来改善LLM主动推理中的信念跟踪问题，显著提升训练稳定性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体在主动推理中经常出现信念偏差问题，导致无法正确建模信念、丢失问题状态跟踪，陷入无信息或重复行动，这会阻碍强化学习训练效果。

Method: 开发T³方法，跟踪模型信念偏差，检测过度的信念偏差并在训练时截断轨迹，移除无信息的部分，保留信息前缀的信用分配。

Result: 在5个挑战性任务中，T³持续提升训练稳定性、token效率和最终性能，获得高达30%的性能增益，同时减少约25%的rollout tokens。

Conclusion: 信念控制是开发稳健和可泛化LLM主动推理器的关键原则。

Abstract: Active reasoning requires large language models (LLMs) to interact with
external sources and strategically gather information to solve problems.
Central to this process is belief tracking: maintaining a coherent
understanding of the problem state and the missing information toward the
solution. However, due to limited reasoning capabilities, LLM-based agents
often suffer from belief deviation: they struggle to correctly model beliefs,
lose track of problem states, and fall into uninformative or repetitive
actions. Once this happens, errors compound and reinforcement learning (RL)
training fails to properly credit the crucial exploratory steps. To address
this issue, we propose to track the deviation of model beliefs and develop
$\mathbf{T^3}$, a simple yet effective method that detects excessive belief
deviation and truncates trajectories during training to remove uninformative
tails. By preserving credit for informative prefixes, $\mathbf{T^3}$
systematically improves policy optimization. Across 5 challenging tasks,
$\mathbf{T^3}$ consistently enhances training stability, token efficiency, and
final performance, achieving up to 30% gains while cutting rollout tokens by
roughly 25%. These results highlight belief control as a key principle for
developing robust and generalizable LLM-based active reasoners.

TL;DR: RAG-Anything是一个统一的多模态检索增强生成框架，能够处理文本、图像、表格和数学表达式等多种模态内容，解决了现有RAG系统仅限于文本的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG系统与真实世界信息环境存在严重不匹配，现实知识库本质上是多模态的，包含文本、视觉元素、结构化表格和数学表达式，但现有RAG框架仅限于文本内容。

Method: 将多模态内容重新概念化为相互连接的知识实体，引入双图构建来捕获跨模态关系和文本语义，开发跨模态混合检索方法，结合结构知识导航和语义匹配。

Result: 在具有挑战性的多模态基准测试中表现出优越性能，相比最先进方法有显著提升，在长文档处理上优势尤为明显。

Conclusion: RAG-Anything为多模态知识访问建立了新范式，消除了当前系统的架构碎片化限制，实现了跨异构内容的有效推理。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a fundamental paradigm
for expanding Large Language Models beyond their static training limitations.
However, a critical misalignment exists between current RAG capabilities and
real-world information environments. Modern knowledge repositories are
inherently multimodal, containing rich combinations of textual content, visual
elements, structured tables, and mathematical expressions. Yet existing RAG
frameworks are limited to textual content, creating fundamental gaps when
processing multimodal documents. We present RAG-Anything, a unified framework
that enables comprehensive knowledge retrieval across all modalities. Our
approach reconceptualizes multimodal content as interconnected knowledge
entities rather than isolated data types. The framework introduces dual-graph
construction to capture both cross-modal relationships and textual semantics
within a unified representation. We develop cross-modal hybrid retrieval that
combines structural knowledge navigation with semantic matching. This enables
effective reasoning over heterogeneous content where relevant evidence spans
multiple modalities. RAG-Anything demonstrates superior performance on
challenging multimodal benchmarks, achieving significant improvements over
state-of-the-art methods. Performance gains become particularly pronounced on
long documents where traditional approaches fail. Our framework establishes a
new paradigm for multimodal knowledge access, eliminating the architectural
fragmentation that constrains current systems. Our framework is open-sourced

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在研究数学中验证困难的问题，即生成的证明看似合理但缺乏严格验证，无法被信任。

Method: 使用LLM+CAS框架，将前沿LLM与计算机代数系统（如Mathematica）结合，通过符号反馈循环：LLM建议域分解，CAS对每个部分进行公理化验证。

Result: 该框架在提出适当的域分解方面表现出色，成功回答了Terence Tao提出的关于LLM与验证器结合能否证明复杂渐近不等式的问题。

Conclusion: LLM+CAS框架展示了AI如何超越竞赛数学，成为专业数学家的研究级工具，为研究级渐近分析提供了有效支持。

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated advanced capabilities in
solving IMO and Putnam problems; yet their role in research mathematics has
remained fairly limited. The key difficulty is verification: suggested proofs
may look plausible, but cannot be trusted without rigorous checking. We present
a framework, called LLM+CAS, and an associated tool, O-Forge, that couples
frontier LLMs with a computer algebra systems (CAS) in an In-Context Symbolic
Feedback loop to produce proofs that are both creative and symbolically
verified. Our focus is on asymptotic inequalities, a topic that often involves
difficult proofs and appropriate decomposition of the domain into the "right"
subdomains. Many mathematicians, including Terry Tao, have suggested that using
AI tools to find the right decompositions can be very useful for research-level
asymptotic analysis. In this paper, we show that our framework LLM+CAS turns
out to be remarkably effective at proposing such decompositions via a
combination of a frontier LLM and a CAS. More precisely, we use an LLM to
suggest domain decomposition, and a CAS (such as Mathematica) that provides a
verification of each piece axiomatically. Using this loop, we answer a question
posed by Terence Tao: whether LLMs coupled with a verifier can be used to help
prove intricate asymptotic inequalities. More broadly, we show how AI can move
beyond contest math towards research-level tools for professional
mathematicians.

TL;DR: 对基于大型语言模型的Vibe Coding范式进行首次系统性综述，建立了理论框架和实践模型，揭示成功Vibe Coding依赖于系统上下文工程、完善开发环境和人机协作模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的发展催生了从代码生成辅助到自主编码代理的范式转变，但Vibe Coding这种新兴开发方法的有效性仍缺乏系统研究，实证证据显示存在意外生产力损失和人机协作挑战。

Method: 通过系统分析1000多篇研究论文，建立约束马尔可夫决策过程理论框架，将现有实践综合为五种开发模型：无约束自动化、迭代对话协作、规划驱动、测试驱动和上下文增强模型。

Result: 建立了Vibe Coding作为正式学科的理论基础，提供了该领域的首个全面分类法，揭示了成功Vibe Coding的关键要素。

Conclusion: 成功的Vibe Coding不仅依赖于代理能力，更需要系统上下文工程、完善开发环境和人机协作开发模型的系统性支持。

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed a paradigm
shift from code generation assistance to autonomous coding agents, enabling a
novel development methodology termed "Vibe Coding" where developers validate
AI-generated implementations through outcome observation rather than
line-by-line code comprehension. Despite its transformative potential, the
effectiveness of this emergent paradigm remains under-explored, with empirical
evidence revealing unexpected productivity losses and fundamental challenges in
human-AI collaboration. To address this gap, this survey provides the first
comprehensive and systematic review of Vibe Coding with large language models,
establishing both theoretical foundations and practical frameworks for this
transformative development approach. Drawing from systematic analysis of over
1000 research papers, we survey the entire vibe coding ecosystem, examining
critical infrastructure components including LLMs for coding, LLM-based coding
agent, development environment of coding agent, and feedback mechanisms. We
first introduce Vibe Coding as a formal discipline by formalizing it through a
Constrained Markov Decision Process that captures the dynamic triadic
relationship among human developers, software projects, and coding agents.
Building upon this theoretical foundation, we then synthesize existing
practices into five distinct development models: Unconstrained Automation,
Iterative Conversational Collaboration, Planning-Driven, Test-Driven, and
Context-Enhanced Models, thus providing the first comprehensive taxonomy in
this domain. Critically, our analysis reveals that successful Vibe Coding
depends not merely on agent capabilities but on systematic context engineering,
well-established development environments, and human-agent collaborative
development models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旅游机构希望将易出错的定价任务自动化给AI系统，但未经验证的LLMs部署可能导致重大财务损失和客户信任危机。

Method: 构建包含300个自然语言问题的基准，基于42个真实定价政策，涵盖两个难度级别：基础客户类型定价和涉及交互折扣的捆绑旅游计算。

Result: 评估显示LLMs在更难层级上性能急剧下降，暴露出规则解释和算术推理的系统性失败。

Conclusion: 尽管具备通用能力，但当前LLMs在没有进一步安全保障或领域适应的情况下，在收入关键应用中仍不可靠。

Abstract: We present PricingLogic, the first benchmark that probes whether Large
Language Models(LLMs) can reliably automate tourism-related prices when
multiple, overlapping fare rules apply. Travel agencies are eager to offload
this error-prone task onto AI systems; however, deploying LLMs without verified
reliability could result in significant financial losses and erode customer
trust. PricingLogic comprises 300 natural-language questions based on booking
requests derived from 42 real-world pricing policies, spanning two levels of
difficulty: (i) basic customer-type pricing and (ii)bundled-tour calculations
involving interacting discounts. Evaluations of a line of LLMs reveal a steep
performance drop on the harder tier,exposing systematic failures in rule
interpretation and arithmetic reasoning.These results highlight that, despite
their general capabilities, today's LLMs remain unreliable in revenue-critical
applications without further safeguards or domain adaptation. Our code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/EIT-NLP/PricingLogic.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了MTOS框架，将多主题环境与LLMs集成，用于模拟社交媒体上的意见演化，解决了现有研究在跨主题认知转移和语言态度简化方面的局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实网络中信息常涉及多个相关主题，现有基于LLM的研究多关注单一主题，传统数值模型则将复杂语言态度简化为离散值，缺乏多主题集成能力和解释性。

Method: MTOS框架整合LLMs与短长期记忆，采用多用户选择交互机制、动态主题选择策略和信念衰减机制，实现跨主题视角更新。

Result: 多主题设置显著改变极化趋势：正相关主题放大回音室效应，负相关主题抑制回音室，无关主题通过资源竞争也缓解回音室效应。相比数值模型，LLM智能体更真实地模拟动态意见变化。

Conclusion: MTOS框架通过多主题集成和LLMs应用，提高了意见模拟的解释性和系统稳定性，能够捕捉复杂的人类推理和语言特征。

Abstract: The polarization of opinions, information segregation, and cognitive biases
on social media have attracted significant academic attention. In real-world
networks, information often spans multiple interrelated topics, posing
challenges for opinion evolution and highlighting the need for frameworks that
simulate interactions among topics. Existing studies based on large language
models (LLMs) focus largely on single topics, limiting the capture of cognitive
transfer in multi-topic, cross-domain contexts. Traditional numerical models,
meanwhile, simplify complex linguistic attitudes into discrete values, lacking
interpretability, behavioral consistency, and the ability to integrate multiple
topics. To address these issues, we propose Multi-topic Opinion Simulation
(MTOS), a social simulation framework integrating multi-topic contexts with
LLMs. MTOS leverages LLMs alongside short-term and long-term memory,
incorporates multiple user-selection interaction mechanisms and dynamic
topic-selection strategies, and employs a belief decay mechanism to enable
perspective updates across topics. We conduct extensive experiments on MTOS,
varying topic numbers, correlation types, and performing ablation studies to
assess features such as group polarization and local consistency. Results show
that multi-topic settings significantly alter polarization trends: positively
correlated topics amplify echo chambers, negatively correlated topics inhibit
them, and irrelevant topics also mitigate echo chamber effects through resource
competition. Compared with numerical models, LLM-based agents realistically
simulate dynamic opinion changes, reproduce linguistic features of news texts,
and capture complex human reasoning, improving simulation interpretability and
system stability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度强化学习（DRL）的决策框架，结合偏置注意力机制，用于无信号交叉口的自动驾驶决策，通过风险评估提升安全性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无信号交叉口由于复杂的动态交互和高冲突风险，自动驾驶决策极具挑战性，需要实现主动安全控制。

Method: 基于Soft Actor-Critic（SAC）算法，使用偏置注意力机制构建交通风险预测器，评估车辆进入交叉口的长期碰撞风险，并将其转化为密集奖励信号指导决策。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法有效提高了交叉口的交通效率和车辆安全性。

Conclusion: 该智能决策框架在复杂场景中具有有效性，证明了基于风险预测的DRL方法在自动驾驶决策中的潜力。

Abstract: Autonomous driving decision-making at unsignalized intersections is highly
challenging due to complex dynamic interactions and high conflict risks. To
achieve proactive safety control, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) decision-making framework integrated with a biased attention
mechanism. The framework is built upon the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm.
Its core innovation lies in the use of biased attention to construct a traffic
risk predictor. This predictor assesses the long-term risk of collision for a
vehicle entering the intersection and transforms this risk into a dense reward
signal to guide the SAC agent in making safe and efficient driving decisions.
Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method
effectively improves both traffic efficiency and vehicle safety at the
intersection, thereby proving the effectiveness of the intelligent
decision-making framework in complex scenarios. The code of our work is

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了LLM作为评判者时的偏见问题，发现现有模型对偏见输入具有鲁棒性，但微调于偏见数据会显著降低性能，并提出四种缓解策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在通信系统中被用于自主评估内容质量，确保这些AI评判者的公正性至关重要，任何评估标准中的偏见都可能影响结果并损害用户信任。

Method: 系统研究两种LLM评判模型在点式评分设置下的11种偏见类型，涵盖隐式和显式偏见形式，分析模型对偏见输入的鲁棒性、微调影响以及评分与任务难度的相关性。

Result: 最先进的LLM评判者对偏见输入具有鲁棒性，通常给偏见样本分配较低分数；提供详细评分标准能增强鲁棒性；在偏见数据上微调会显著降低性能；评判分数与任务难度相关。

Conclusion: LLM评判者存在偏见风险，需要采取缓解策略来确保实际通信场景中AI评判的公平性和可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to autonomously
evaluate the quality of content in communication systems, e.g., to assess
responses in telecom customer support chatbots. However, the impartiality of
these AI "judges" is not guaranteed, and any biases in their evaluation
criteria could skew outcomes and undermine user trust. In this paper, we
systematically investigate judgment biases in two LLM-as-a-judge models (i.e.,
GPT-Judge and JudgeLM) under the point-wise scoring setting, encompassing 11
types of biases that cover both implicit and explicit forms. We observed that
state-of-the-art LLM judges demonstrate robustness to biased inputs, generally
assigning them lower scores than the corresponding clean samples. Providing a
detailed scoring rubric further enhances this robustness. We further found that
fine-tuning an LLM on high-scoring yet biased responses can significantly
degrade its performance, highlighting the risk of training on biased data. We
also discovered that the judged scores correlate with task difficulty: a
challenging dataset like GPQA yields lower average scores, whereas an
open-ended reasoning dataset (e.g., JudgeLM-val) sees higher average scores.
Finally, we proposed four potential mitigation strategies to ensure fair and
reliable AI judging in practical communication scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在构建一个能够有效支持临床决策的医疗对话系统，通过结构化的问题流程和自动化报告生成来减轻医生认知负担，提高医疗访谈效率。

Method: 采用有向无环图结构组织医疗问题，包含五个关键机制：医疗指南转换管道、基于层次聚类的冷启动、扩展剪枝自适应分支、终止逻辑和结构化报告自动合成。

Result: 患者应用获得低认知负荷(15.6)、高可用性(86)和强满意度(8.1/9)；医生应用获得中等认知负荷(26)、极高可用性(88.5)和高满意度(8.3/9)，有效集成到临床工作流中。

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了高效的任务导向医疗对话，显著降低了认知需求并支持高效报告生成，但存在系统延迟和评估样本有限的问题。

Abstract: We developed a task-oriented dialogue framework structured as a Directed
Acyclic Graph (DAG) of medical questions. The system integrates: (1) a
systematic pipeline for transforming medical algorithms and guidelines into a
clinical question corpus; (2) a cold-start mechanism based on hierarchical
clustering to generate efficient initial questioning without prior patient
information; (3) an expand-and-prune mechanism enabling adaptive branching and
backtracking based on patient responses; (4) a termination logic to ensure
interviews end once sufficient information is gathered; and (5) automated
synthesis of doctor-friendly structured reports aligned with clinical
workflows. Human-computer interaction principles guided the design of both the
patient and physician applications. Preliminary evaluation involved five
physicians using standardized instruments: NASA-TLX (cognitive workload), the
System Usability Scale (SUS), and the Questionnaire for User Interface
Satisfaction (QUIS). The patient application achieved low workload scores
(NASA-TLX = 15.6), high usability (SUS = 86), and strong satisfaction (QUIS =
8.1/9), with particularly high ratings for ease of learning and interface
design. The physician application yielded moderate workload (NASA-TLX = 26) and
excellent usability (SUS = 88.5), with satisfaction scores of 8.3/9. Both
applications demonstrated effective integration into clinical workflows,
reducing cognitive demand and supporting efficient report generation.
Limitations included occasional system latency and a small, non-diverse
evaluation sample.

Motivation: 当前AI虚拟细胞模型虽然在单细胞和空间基础模型方面取得进展，但在跨实验室和平台传输、剂量时间组合效应处理、跨尺度耦合等方面存在局限，需要更系统化的评估框架。

Method: 提出模型无关的细胞状态潜在（CSL）视角，采用操作符语法组织学习：测量、跨尺度耦合的lift/project、以及剂量和调度的干预。

Result: 建立了决策对齐的评估蓝图，涵盖模态、尺度、背景和干预，强调功能空间读出如通路活性、空间邻域和临床相关终点。

Conclusion: 推荐操作符感知的数据设计、防泄漏分区以及透明校准和报告，以实现可重复的同类比较，提升AI虚拟细胞模型的实用性和可靠性。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence Virtual Cells (AIVCs) aim to learn executable,
decision-relevant models of cell state from multimodal, multiscale
measurements. Recent studies have introduced single-cell and spatial foundation
models, improved cross-modality alignment, scaled perturbation atlases, and
explored pathway-level readouts. Nevertheless, although held-out validation is
standard practice, evaluations remain predominantly within single datasets and
settings; evidence indicates that transport across laboratories and platforms
is often limited, that some data splits are vulnerable to leakage and coverage
bias, and that dose, time and combination effects are not yet systematically
handled. Cross-scale coupling also remains constrained, as anchors linking
molecular, cellular and tissue levels are sparse, and alignment to scientific
or clinical readouts varies across studies. We propose a model-agnostic
Cell-State Latent (CSL) perspective that organizes learning via an operator
grammar: measurement, lift/project for cross-scale coupling, and intervention
for dosing and scheduling. This view motivates a decision-aligned evaluation
blueprint across modality, scale, context and intervention, and emphasizes
function-space readouts such as pathway activity, spatial neighborhoods and
clinically relevant endpoints. We recommend operator-aware data design,
leakage-resistant partitions, and transparent calibration and reporting to
enable reproducible, like-for-like comparisons.

Motivation: 现有基于原型的模型通常在粗粒度（句子或文档级别）操作，无法处理现实世界文本分类的多标签特性，需要更细粒度的可解释模型。

Method: 采用双阶段交替训练策略：无监督原型发现阶段学习语义连贯且多样化的原型，监督分类阶段将这些原型映射到类别标签。使用分层损失函数确保子句、句子和文档级别的一致性。

Result: 在酒店评论数据集和两个公共基准测试（二分类和多分类）上的实验表明，ProtoSiTex实现了最先进的性能，同时提供忠实且人类对齐的解释。

Conclusion: ProtoSiTex是半可解释多标签文本分类的稳健解决方案，能够捕获重叠和冲突的语义，并使用自适应原型和多头注意力机制。

Abstract: The surge in user-generated reviews has amplified the need for interpretable
models that can provide fine-grained insights. Existing prototype-based models
offer intuitive explanations but typically operate at coarse granularity
(sentence or document level) and fail to address the multi-label nature of
real-world text classification. We propose ProtoSiTex, a semi-interpretable
framework designed for fine-grained multi-label text classification. ProtoSiTex
employs a dual-phase alternating training strategy: an unsupervised prototype
discovery phase that learns semantically coherent and diverse prototypes, and a
supervised classification phase that maps these prototypes to class labels. A
hierarchical loss function enforces consistency across sub-sentence, sentence,
and document levels, enhancing interpretability and alignment. Unlike prior
approaches, ProtoSiTex captures overlapping and conflicting semantics using
adaptive prototypes and multi-head attention. We also introduce a benchmark
dataset of hotel reviews annotated at the sub-sentence level with multiple
labels. Experiments on this dataset and two public benchmarks (binary and
multi-class) show that ProtoSiTex achieves state-of-the-art performance while
delivering faithful, human-aligned explanations, establishing it as a robust
solution for semi-interpretable multi-label text classification.

Method: 设计HardcoreLogic基准，系统性地通过三个维度转换规范谜题：增加复杂性(IC)、罕见元素(UE)和不可解谜题(UP)，减少对捷径记忆的依赖。

Result: 评估显示即使在其他基准上表现优异的模型也出现显著性能下降，表明模型严重依赖记忆的刻板印象。增加复杂性是主要困难来源，但模型在细微规则变化上也表现不佳。

Conclusion: HardcoreLogic揭示了当前大型推理模型的局限性，为推进高级逻辑推理建立了基准测试标准。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on
complex tasks, including logical puzzle games that require deriving solutions
satisfying all constraints. However, whether they can flexibly apply
appropriate rules to varying conditions, particularly when faced with
non-canonical game variants, remains an open question. Existing corpora focus
on popular puzzles like 9x9 Sudoku, risking overfitting to canonical formats
and memorization of solution patterns, which can mask deficiencies in
understanding novel rules or adapting strategies to new variants. To address
this, we introduce HardcoreLogic, a challenging benchmark of over 5,000 puzzles
across 10 games, designed to test the robustness of LRMs on the "long-tail" of
logical games. HardcoreLogic systematically transforms canonical puzzles
through three dimensions: Increased Complexity (IC), Uncommon Elements (UE),
and Unsolvable Puzzles (UP), reducing reliance on shortcut memorization.
Evaluations on a diverse set of LRMs reveal significant performance drops, even
for models achieving top scores on existing benchmarks, indicating heavy
reliance on memorized stereotypes. While increased complexity is the dominant
source of difficulty, models also struggle with subtle rule variations that do
not necessarily increase puzzle difficulty. Our systematic error analysis on
solvable and unsolvable puzzles further highlights gaps in genuine reasoning.
Overall, HardcoreLogic exposes the limitations of current LRMs and establishes
a benchmark for advancing high-level logical reasoning.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在长程智能体任务中面临内存限制，现有工作内存方法依赖外部启发式机制，与智能体核心策略脱节。

Method: 提出Memory-as-Action框架，智能体通过执行显式编辑操作主动管理工作内存，作为统一策略的一部分。为解决轨迹断裂问题，提出动态上下文策略优化算法。

Result: 端到端联合优化不仅减少了计算消耗，还提高了任务性能，通过适应性的上下文管理策略来匹配模型的内在能力。

Conclusion: 将内存管理作为可学习的内在能力，通过端到端强化学习联合优化，能有效提升LLM在长程任务中的性能并减少计算开销。

Abstract: Large Language Models face challenges in long-horizon agentic tasks as their
constrained memory is easily overwhelmed by distracting or irrelevant context.
Existing working memory methods typically rely on external, heuristic
mechanisms that are decoupled from the agent's core policy. In this work, we
reframe working memory management as a learnable, intrinsic capability. We
propose a novel framework, Memory-as-Action, where an agent actively manages
its working memory by executing explicit editing operations as part of a
unified policy. This formulation allows an agent, trained via reinforcement
learning, to balance memory curation against long-term task objectives under
given resource constraints. However, such memory editing actions break the
standard assumption of a continuously growing prefix in LLM interactions,
leading to what we call trajectory fractures. These non-prefix changes disrupt
the causal continuity required by standard policy gradient methods, making
those methods inapplicable. To address this, we propose a new algorithm,
Dynamic Context Policy Optimization, which enables stable end-to-end
reinforcement learning by segmenting trajectories at memory action points and
applying trajectory-level advantages to the resulting action segments. Our
results demonstrate that jointly optimizing for task reasoning and memory
management in an end-to-end fashion not only reduces overall computational
consumption but also improves task performance, driven by adaptive context
curation strategies tailored to the model's intrinsic capabilities.

Motivation: 解决高性能具身AI系统依赖昂贵大型模型，而小型模型缺乏必要知识和技能的问题

Method: 两阶段框架：1)具身先验学习，从轨迹增强、环境锚定和外部知识三种数据中提炼知识；2)在线强化学习，包含自总结、密集奖励塑造和回合级策略优化

Result: ERA-3B在EB-ALFRED和EB-Manipulation任务上分别比GPT-4o提升8.4%和19.4%，并在未见任务上表现出强泛化能力

Conclusion: ERA为可扩展的具身智能提供了实用路径，为未来具身AI系统提供了方法论启示

Abstract: Recent advances in embodied AI highlight the potential of vision language
models (VLMs) as agents capable of perception, reasoning, and interaction in
complex environments. However, top-performing systems rely on large-scale
models that are costly to deploy, while smaller VLMs lack the necessary
knowledge and skills to succeed. To bridge this gap, we present
\textit{Embodied Reasoning Agent (ERA)}, a two-stage framework that integrates
prior knowledge learning and online reinforcement learning (RL). The first
stage, \textit{Embodied Prior Learning}, distills foundational knowledge from
three types of data: (1) Trajectory-Augmented Priors, which enrich existing
trajectory data with structured reasoning generated by stronger models; (2)
Environment-Anchored Priors, which provide in-environment knowledge and
grounding supervision; and (3) External Knowledge Priors, which transfer
general knowledge from out-of-environment datasets. In the second stage, we
develop an online RL pipeline that builds on these priors to further enhance
agent performance. To overcome the inherent challenges in agent RL, including
long horizons, sparse rewards, and training instability, we introduce three key
designs: self-summarization for context management, dense reward shaping, and
turn-level policy optimization. Extensive experiments on both high-level
planning (EB-ALFRED) and low-level control (EB-Manipulation) tasks demonstrate
that ERA-3B surpasses both prompting-based large models and previous
training-based baselines. Specifically, it achieves overall improvements of
8.4\% on EB-ALFRED and 19.4\% on EB-Manipulation over GPT-4o, and exhibits
strong generalization to unseen tasks. Overall, ERA offers a practical path
toward scalable embodied intelligence, providing methodological insights for
future embodied AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM作为法官的方法依赖简单聚合（如多数投票），即使个体智能体给出正确答案也可能失败，需要更有效的协作判断机制。

Method: 建立多智能体辩论法官框架，智能体协作推理并迭代优化回答；引入稳定性检测机制，通过时变Beta-Binomial混合模型建模法官共识动态，基于分布相似性（K-S检验）实现自适应停止。

Result: 在多个基准测试和模型上的实验表明，该框架相比多数投票方法提高了判断准确性，同时保持了计算效率。

Conclusion: 多智能体辩论框架能有效放大正确性，通过数学形式化分析和稳定性检测机制，为LLM自动判断任务提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: With advancements in reasoning capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) are
increasingly employed for automated judgment tasks. While LLMs-as-Judges offer
promise in automating evaluations, current approaches often rely on simplistic
aggregation methods (e.g., majority voting), which can fail even when
individual agents provide correct answers. To address this, we propose a
multi-agent debate judge framework where agents collaboratively reason and
iteratively refine their responses. We formalize the debate process
mathematically, analyzing agent interactions and proving that debate amplifies
correctness compared to static ensembles. To enhance efficiency, we introduce a
stability detection mechanism that models judge consensus dynamics via a
time-varying Beta-Binomial mixture, with adaptive stopping based on
distributional similarity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). This mechanism models the
judges' collective correct rate dynamics using a time-varying mixture of
Beta-Binomial distributions and employs an adaptive stopping criterion based on
distributional similarity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic). Experiments across
multiple benchmarks and models demonstrate that our framework improves judgment
accuracy over majority voting while maintaining computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶面临安全挑战，传统传感器存在视野受限和被遮挡的问题。车辆间通信（V2V）能够共享信息，提高环境感知能力，特别是在传感器被遮挡时。

Method: 设计并训练了基于合作感知消息的图神经网络（CAMNet），在广泛使用的运动预测数据集上进行训练，并在专门创建的CAM数据集上进行评估。

Result: 方法显示出有希望的结果，证明CAM数据确实可以支持车辆轨迹预测，但同时也存在一些局限性。

Conclusion: CAM数据在车辆轨迹预测中具有应用潜力，为未来研究提供了机会，但需要解决当前方法的局限性。

Abstract: Autonomous driving remains a challenging task, particularly due to safety
concerns. Modern vehicles are typically equipped with expensive sensors such as
LiDAR, cameras, and radars to reduce the risk of accidents. However, these
sensors face inherent limitations: their field of view and line of sight can be
obstructed by other vehicles, thereby reducing situational awareness. In this
context, vehicle-to-vehicle communication plays a crucial role, as it enables
cars to share information and remain aware of each other even when sensors are
occluded. One way to achieve this is through the use of Cooperative Awareness
Messages (CAMs). In this paper, we investigate the use of CAM data for vehicle
trajectory prediction. Specifically, we design and train a neural network,
Cooperative Awareness Message-based Graph Neural Network (CAMNet), on a widely
used motion forecasting dataset. We then evaluate the model on a second dataset
that we created from scratch using Cooperative Awareness Messages, in order to
assess whether this type of data can be effectively exploited. Our approach
demonstrates promising results, showing that CAMs can indeed support vehicle
trajectory prediction. At the same time, we discuss several limitations of the
approach, which highlight opportunities for future research.

Method: 利用自监督学习原理从无标签数据中学习有用表示，结合图论技术更有效地识别和分类OOD样本。

Result: 与现有最先进方法相比，该方法在AUROC指标上达到0.99。

Conclusion: 该方法能够显著提高AI系统的鲁棒性，特别是在处理分布外样本方面表现优异。

Abstract: Robustness in AI systems refers to their ability to maintain reliable and
accurate performance under various conditions, including out-of-distribution
(OOD) samples, adversarial attacks, and environmental changes. This is crucial
in safety-critical systems, such as autonomous vehicles, transportation, or
healthcare, where malfunctions could have severe consequences. This paper
proposes an approach to improve OOD detection without the need of labeled data,
thereby increasing the AI systems' robustness. The proposed approach leverages
the principles of self-supervised learning, allowing the model to learn useful
representations from unlabeled data. Combined with graph-theoretical
techniques, this enables the more efficient identification and categorization
of OOD samples. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, this approach
achieved an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) =
0.99.

TL;DR: CLUTCH是一种基于深度组合多臂赌博机的新型JavaScript模糊测试方法，通过注意力机制和Concrete Dropout动态选择变异目标，相比现有方法提高了测试用例有效性和覆盖率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的JavaScript模糊测试方法使用随机选择来确定变异位置，这不够高效。作者认为选择更好的变异目标问题适合使用具有可变臂数的组合赌博机来解决。

Method: 提出CLUTCH深度组合赌博机，使用注意力机制处理可变长度的JavaScript测试用例表示，并通过Concrete Dropout动态调整探索策略。

Result: CLUTCH在JavaScript模糊测试中比三种最先进方法平均提高了20.3%的有效测试用例数量和8.9%的每测试用例覆盖率。在波动和组合设置中，分别实现了至少78.1%和4.1%的更少遗憾值。

Conclusion: CLUTCH通过深度组合赌博机方法有效解决了JavaScript模糊测试中的变异目标选择问题，显著提高了测试效率和覆盖率。

Abstract: JavaScript engines are widely used in web browsers, PDF readers, and
server-side applications. The rise in concern over their security has led to
the development of several targeted fuzzing techniques. However, existing
approaches use random selection to determine where to perform mutations in
JavaScript code. We postulate that the problem of selecting better mutation
targets is suitable for combinatorial bandits with a volatile number of arms.
Thus, we propose CLUTCH, a novel deep combinatorial bandit that can observe
variable length JavaScript test case representations, using an attention
mechanism from deep learning. Furthermore, using Concrete Dropout, CLUTCH can
dynamically adapt its exploration. We show that CLUTCH increases efficiency in
JavaScript fuzzing compared to three state-of-the-art solutions by increasing
the number of valid test cases and coverage-per-testcase by, respectively,
20.3% and 8.9% on average. In volatile and combinatorial settings we show that
CLUTCH outperforms state-of-the-art bandits, achieving at least 78.1% and 4.1%
less regret in volatile and combinatorial settings, respectively.

TL;DR: CTRL-Rec是一个允许用户通过自然语言实时控制推荐系统的方法，使用LLM模拟用户对物品的批准判断，训练嵌入模型来近似这些判断，并将其集成到传统推荐系统的信号加权中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当用户对推荐系统不满意时，他们往往缺乏细粒度的控制手段来改变推荐结果。大语言模型提供了通过自然语言请求来指导推荐的解决方案。

Method: 在训练时使用LLM模拟用户基于语言请求对物品的批准判断，训练嵌入模型来近似这些判断，并将基于用户请求的预测集成到传统推荐系统的标准信号加权中。部署时每个用户请求只需要一次LLM嵌入计算。

Result: 在MovieLens数据集上的实验表明，该方法在各种请求下都能实现细粒度控制。在19名Letterboxd用户的研究中，CTRL-Rec受到用户积极评价，与传统控制相比显著增强了用户的控制感和推荐满意度。

Conclusion: CTRL-Rec方法能够通过自然语言实现对传统推荐系统的实时控制，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了用户体验和控制感。

Abstract: When users are dissatisfied with recommendations from a recommender system,
they often lack fine-grained controls for changing them. Large language models
(LLMs) offer a solution by allowing users to guide their recommendations
through natural language requests (e.g., "I want to see respectful posts with a
different perspective than mine"). We propose a method, CTRL-Rec, that allows
for natural language control of traditional recommender systems in real-time
with computational efficiency. Specifically, at training time, we use an LLM to
simulate whether users would approve of items based on their language requests,
and we train embedding models that approximate such simulated judgments. We
then integrate these user-request-based predictions into the standard weighting
of signals that traditional recommender systems optimize. At deployment time,
we require only a single LLM embedding computation per user request, allowing
for real-time control of recommendations. In experiments with the MovieLens
dataset, our method consistently allows for fine-grained control across a
diversity of requests. In a study with 19 Letterboxd users, we find that
CTRL-Rec was positively received by users and significantly enhanced users'
sense of control and satisfaction with recommendations compared to traditional
controls.

TL;DR: 该论文通过大规模实验研究多智能体强化学习中的合作、鲁棒性和恢复能力，发现在不确定性环境下，单纯优化合作性能不足以保证系统的可靠性和恢复能力，而超参数调优对提升这些特性至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多智能体强化学习系统在理想模拟环境中调优的合作策略，在现实世界不确定性下往往缺乏鲁棒性和恢复能力。为了构建可信赖的MARL系统，需要深入理解鲁棒性（在不确定性下的稳定性）和恢复能力（从干扰中恢复的能力）这两个在控制系统中被广泛研究但在MARL中被忽视的概念。

Method: 进行了大规模实证研究，包含82,620个实验，评估了4个真实世界环境、13种不确定性类型和15个超参数在多智能体强化学习中的合作、鲁棒性和恢复能力表现。

Result: 研究发现：（1）在轻度不确定性下，优化合作能提升鲁棒性和恢复能力，但随着扰动加剧，这种联系减弱；（2）鲁棒性和恢复能力在不同不确定性模式和智能体范围间不具通用性；（3）超参数调优对可信赖MARL至关重要，某些标准实践可能损害鲁棒性，而其他方法如早停、高critic学习率和Leaky ReLU则能持续帮助。

Conclusion: 通过仅优化超参数，可以在所有MARL骨干网络中显著提升合作、鲁棒性和恢复能力，这一现象也推广到这些骨干网络上的鲁棒MARL方法中，强调了超参数调优在构建可信赖多智能体强化学习系统中的重要性。

Abstract: In cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), it is a common
practice to tune hyperparameters in ideal simulated environments to maximize
cooperative performance. However, policies tuned for cooperation often fail to
maintain robustness and resilience under real-world uncertainties. Building
trustworthy MARL systems requires a deep understanding of robustness, which
ensures stability under uncertainties, and resilience, the ability to recover
from disruptions--a concept extensively studied in control systems but largely
overlooked in MARL. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study
comprising over 82,620 experiments to evaluate cooperation, robustness, and
resilience in MARL across 4 real-world environments, 13 uncertainty types, and
15 hyperparameters. Our key findings are: (1) Under mild uncertainty,
optimizing cooperation improves robustness and resilience, but this link
weakens as perturbations intensify. Robustness and resilience also varies by
algorithm and uncertainty type. (2) Robustness and resilience do not generalize
across uncertainty modalities or agent scopes: policies robust to action noise
for all agents may fail under observation noise on a single agent. (3)
Hyperparameter tuning is critical for trustworthy MARL: surprisingly, standard
practices like parameter sharing, GAE, and PopArt can hurt robustness, while
early stopping, high critic learning rates, and Leaky ReLU consistently help.
By optimizing hyperparameters only, we observe substantial improvement in
cooperation, robustness and resilience across all MARL backbones, with the
phenomenon also generalizing to robust MARL methods across these backbones.

TL;DR: 提出了MARL-BC框架，将深度多智能体强化学习与真实商业周期模型结合，旨在解决传统异质智能体宏观经济模型的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统异质智能体宏观经济模型存在两大问题：基于一般均衡和理性预期的HANK/KS模型计算复杂且限制异质性建模，而基于行为规则的ABM模型开发过程繁琐。需要一种能兼顾灵活性和计算效率的新方法。

Method: 开发MARL-BC框架，将深度多智能体强化学习与真实商业周期模型集成，通过强化学习训练智能体决策，无需预设行为规则。

Result: MARL-BC能够：(1)在单智能体情况下重现标准RBC结果；(2)使用大量相同智能体重现KS模型结果；(3)有效模拟丰富的智能体异质性，这是传统GE方法难以完成的任务。

Conclusion: 该框架可作为具有多种异质交互智能体的ABM使用，并在极限情况下重现GE结果，是融合对立建模范式的重要一步。

Abstract: Current macroeconomic models with agent heterogeneity can be broadly divided
into two main groups. Heterogeneous-agent general equilibrium (GE) models, such
as those based on Heterogeneous Agents New Keynesian (HANK) or Krusell-Smith
(KS) approaches, rely on GE and 'rational expectations', somewhat unrealistic
assumptions that make the models very computationally cumbersome, which in turn
limits the amount of heterogeneity that can be modelled. In contrast,
agent-based models (ABMs) can flexibly encompass a large number of arbitrarily
heterogeneous agents, but typically require the specification of explicit
behavioural rules, which can lead to a lengthy trial-and-error
model-development process. To address these limitations, we introduce MARL-BC,
a framework that integrates deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with
Real Business Cycle (RBC) models. We demonstrate that MARL-BC can: (1) recover
textbook RBC results when using a single agent; (2) recover the results of the
mean-field KS model using a large number of identical agents; and (3)
effectively simulate rich heterogeneity among agents, a hard task for
traditional GE approaches. Our framework can be thought of as an ABM if used
with a variety of heterogeneous interacting agents, and can reproduce GE
results in limit cases. As such, it is a step towards a synthesis of these
often opposed modelling paradigms.

Abstract: We propose a two-level information-theoretic framework for characterizing the
informational organization of Agent-Based Model (ABM) dynamics within the
broader paradigm of Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS). At the macro level, a
pooled $\epsilon$-machine is reconstructed as a reference model that summarizes
the system-wide informational regime. At the micro level, $\epsilon$-machines
are reconstructed for each caregiver-elder dyad and variable, and are
complemented with algorithm-agnostic Kolmogorov-style measures, including
normalized LZ78 complexity and bits per symbol from lossless compression. The
resulting feature set $\{h_{\mu}, C_{\mu}, E, \mathrm{LZ78}, \mathrm{bps}\}$
enables distributional analysis, stratified comparisons, and unsupervised
clustering across agents and scenarios. This dual-scale design preserves agent
heterogeneity while providing an interpretable macro-level baseline, aligning
ABM practice with CAS principles of emergence, feedback, and adaptation. A case
study on caregiver-elder interactions illustrates the framework's
implementation; the results and discussion will be completed following final
simulation runs.

Abstract: As the demand for immersive 3D content grows, the need for intuitive and
efficient interaction methods becomes paramount. Current techniques for
physically manipulating 3D content within Virtual Reality (VR) often face
significant limitations, including reliance on engineering-intensive processes
and simplified geometric representations, such as tetrahedral cages, which can
compromise visual fidelity and physical accuracy. In this paper, we introduce
\our{} (\textbf{G}aussian \textbf{S}platting for \textbf{V}irtual
\textbf{E}nvironment \textbf{R}endering and \textbf{S}cene \textbf{E}diting), a
novel method designed to overcome these challenges by directly integrating an
object's mesh with a Gaussian Splatting (GS) representation. Our approach
enables more precise surface approximation, leading to highly realistic
deformations and interactions. By leveraging existing 3D mesh assets, \our{}
facilitates seamless content reuse and simplifies the development workflow.
Moreover, our system is designed to be physics-engine-agnostic, granting
developers robust deployment flexibility. This versatile architecture delivers
a highly realistic, adaptable, and intuitive approach to interactive 3D
manipulation. We rigorously validate our method against the current
state-of-the-art technique that couples VR with GS in a comparative user study
involving 18 participants. Specifically, we demonstrate that our approach is
statistically significantly better for physics-aware stretching manipulation
and is also more consistent in other physics-based manipulations like twisting
and shaking. Further evaluation across various interactions and scenes confirms
that our method consistently delivers high and reliable performance, showing
its potential as a plausible alternative to existing methods.

Result: 在多种材料刚度和网格分辨率下，收敛速度显著优于标准坐标下降和JGS2方法

Conclusion: 当子空间能充分捕捉全局耦合时，该方法可实现接近牛顿法的收敛，同时保持坐标下降的效率和并行性

Abstract: We introduce Coordinate Condensation, a variant of coordinate descent that
accelerates physics-based simulation by augmenting local coordinate updates
with a Schur-complement-based subspace correction. Recent work by Lan et al.
2025 (JGS2) uses perturbation subspaces to augment local solves to account for
global coupling, but their approach introduces damping that can degrade
convergence. We reuse this subspace but solve for local and subspace
displacements independently, eliminating this damping. For problems where the
subspace adequately captures global coupling, our method achieves near-Newton
convergence while retaining the efficiency and parallelism of coordinate
descent. Through experiments across varying material stiffnesses and mesh
resolutions, we show substantially faster convergence than both standard
coordinate descent and JGS2. We also characterize when subspace-based
coordinate methods succeed or fail, offering insights for future solver design.

Abstract: Representation learning on text-attributed graphs (TAGs) integrates
structural connectivity with rich textual semantics, enabling applications in
diverse domains. Current methods largely rely on contrastive learning to
maximize cross-modal similarity, assuming tighter coupling between graph and
text representations improves transfer performance. However, our empirical
analysis reveals that both natural gap expansion and forced gap reduction
result in performance degradation by disrupting pre-trained knowledge
structures and impairing generalization. This arises from the geometric
incompatibility between encoders, where graph encoders capture topological
patterns, while text encoders capture semantic structures. Over-alignment
compresses these distinct spaces into shared subspaces, causing structure
collapse that diminishes both topological reasoning and semantic understanding.
We propose \textbf{LLM4GTA}, a gap-aware alignment framework that preserves
representation gaps as geometric necessities for maintaining modality-specific
knowledge and improving transfer performance. LLM4GTA includes an adaptive gap
preservation module to prevent over-alignment by monitoring similarity
evolution and an intra-modal compensation mechanism that boosts discriminative
power using auxiliary classifiers in graph space. Extensive experiments show
significant improvements over existing methods in zero-shot and few-shot
scenarios.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 本文提出了多级别草图表示方案和SDGraph深度学习架构，通过三个层次（草图级、笔画级、点级）系统识别和利用草图中的有效信息，在分类、检索和矢量草图生成任务中显著提升了性能。

Result: 在分类任务中准确率比最先进方法提升1.15%，检索任务提升1.70%，矢量草图生成质量提升36.58%。

Conclusion: 系统识别和利用草图中的多级别有效信息能够显著提升草图相关任务的性能，SDGraph架构为草图学习提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Freehand sketches exhibit unique sparsity and abstraction, necessitating
learning pipelines distinct from those designed for images. For sketch learning
methods, the central objective is to fully exploit the effective information
embedded in sketches. However, there is limited research on what constitutes
effective sketch information, which in turn constrains the performance of
existing approaches. To tackle this issue, we first proposed the Multi-Level
Sketch Representation Scheme to systematically identify the effective
information. The scheme organizes sketch representation into three levels:
sketch-level, stroke-level, and point-level. This design is based on the
granularity of analytical elements, from coarse (sketch-level) to fine
(point-level), thereby ensuring more comprehensive coverage of the sketch
information. For each level, we conducted theoretical analyses and experimental
evaluations to identify and validate the effective information. Building on the
above studies, we developed SDGraph, a deep learning architecture designed to
exploit the identified effective information across the three levels. SDGraph
comprises two complementary modules: a Sparse Graph that treats strokes as
nodes for sketch-level and stroke-level representation learning, and a Dense
Graph that treats points as nodes for sketch-level and point-level
representation learning. Both modules employ graph convolution along with
down-sampling and up-sampling operations, enabling them to function as both
encoder and decoder. Besides that, an information fusion module bridges the two
graphs to further enhance feature extraction. SDGraph supports a wide range of
sketch-related downstream tasks, achieving accuracy improvements of 1.15\% and
1.70\% over the state-of-the-art in classification and retrieval, respectively,
and 36.58\% improvement in vector sketch generation quality.

*Guojian Li,Qijie Shao,Zhixian Zhao,Shuiyuan Wang,Zhonghua Fu,Lei Xie*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的串行-并行双路径架构用于语音风格识别，通过融合声学和语言模态信息，在显著减少参数量的同时大幅提升识别准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的风格识别方法主要依赖语言信息，声学信息整合有限，这限制了识别准确率的提升。声学和语言模态的融合具有显著提升识别性能的潜力。

Method: 采用串行-并行双路径架构：串行路径遵循ASR+STYLE串行范式，反映顺序时间依赖；并行路径集成了设计的声学-语言相似性模块(ALSM)，以促进具有时间同时性的跨模态交互。

Result: 与现有SSR基线OSUM模型相比，该方法参数规模减少88.4%，在测试集上对八种风格的SSR准确率提升了30.3%。

Conclusion: 提出的串行-并行双路径架构有效融合了声学和语言模态信息，在显著降低模型复杂度的同时大幅提升了语音风格识别的性能。

Abstract: Speaking Style Recognition (SSR) identifies a speaker's speaking style
characteristics from speech. Existing style recognition approaches primarily
rely on linguistic information, with limited integration of acoustic
information, which restricts recognition accuracy improvements. The fusion of
acoustic and linguistic modalities offers significant potential to enhance
recognition performance. In this paper, we propose a novel serial-parallel
dual-path architecture for SSR that leverages acoustic-linguistic bimodal
information. The serial path follows the ASR+STYLE serial paradigm, reflecting
a sequential temporal dependency, while the parallel path integrates our
designed Acoustic-Linguistic Similarity Module (ALSM) to facilitate cross-modal
interaction with temporal simultaneity. Compared to the existing SSR baseline
-- the OSUM model, our approach reduces parameter size by 88.4% and achieves a
30.3% improvement in SSR accuracy for eight styles on the test set.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: SeeingSounds是一个轻量级模块化音频到图像生成框架，通过双对齐机制将音频映射到语义语言空间和视觉域，无需配对音频-视觉数据或视觉生成模型训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受认知神经科学启发，反映人类感知中自然跨模态关联，避免仅将音频作为文本替代或依赖音频-文本映射。

Method: 使用冻结语言编码器将音频投影到语义语言空间，通过视觉语言模型上下文接地到视觉域，在冻结扩散骨干上仅训练轻量适配器，支持通过程序化文本提示生成实现细粒度控制。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，SeeingSounds在零样本和监督设置下均优于现有方法，在可控音频到视觉生成方面达到新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了高效可扩展的学习，通过音频转换（如音量或音高变化）生成描述性提示来指导视觉输出，建立了音频到视觉生成的新范式。

Abstract: We introduce SeeingSounds, a lightweight and modular framework for
audio-to-image generation that leverages the interplay between audio, language,
and vision-without requiring any paired audio-visual data or training on visual
generative models. Rather than treating audio as a substitute for text or
relying solely on audio-to-text mappings, our method performs dual alignment:
audio is projected into a semantic language space via a frozen language
encoder, and, contextually grounded into the visual domain using a
vision-language model. This approach, inspired by cognitive neuroscience,
reflects the natural cross-modal associations observed in human perception. The
model operates on frozen diffusion backbones and trains only lightweight
adapters, enabling efficient and scalable learning. Moreover, it supports
fine-grained and interpretable control through procedural text prompt
generation, where audio transformations (e.g., volume or pitch shifts)
translate into descriptive prompts (e.g., "a distant thunder") that guide
visual outputs. Extensive experiments across standard benchmarks confirm that
SeeingSounds outperforms existing methods in both zero-shot and supervised
settings, establishing a new state of the art in controllable audio-to-visual
generation.

*Yi Wang,Yinfeng Yu,Fuchun Sun,Liejun Wang,Wendong Zheng*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: AGVP框架通过音频-视觉对齐机制解决音频-视觉导航中的跨源泛化问题，将声音从策略记忆的声学指纹线索转化为空间引导，提升对未听过声音的导航性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AVN方法在遇到未听过的声音或未见过的环境时导航成功率骤降，搜索路径过长，这源于缺乏听觉信号与对应视觉区域的显式对齐机制。

Method: 提出AGVP框架：通过音频自注意力提取全局听觉上下文，将其作为查询引导视觉特征注意力，在特征层面突出声源相关区域，然后进行时序建模和策略优化。

Result: 实验结果表明AGVP在导航效率和鲁棒性方面均有提升，在未听过声音上实现了优异的跨场景泛化性能。

Conclusion: 基于可解释的跨模态对齐和区域重加权设计的AGVP框架，减少了对特定声学指纹的依赖，显著改善了音频-视觉导航的跨源泛化能力。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Embodied Navigation aims to enable agents to autonomously
navigate to sound sources in unknown 3D environments using auditory cues. While
current AVN methods excel on in-distribution sound sources, they exhibit poor
cross-source generalization: navigation success rates plummet and search paths
become excessively long when agents encounter unheard sounds or unseen
environments. This limitation stems from the lack of explicit alignment
mechanisms between auditory signals and corresponding visual regions. Policies
tend to memorize spurious \enquote{acoustic fingerprint-scenario} correlations
during training, leading to blind exploration when exposed to novel sound
sources. To address this, we propose the AGVP framework, which transforms sound
from policy-memorable acoustic fingerprint cues into spatial guidance. The
framework first extracts global auditory context via audio self-attention, then
uses this context as queries to guide visual feature attention, highlighting
sound-source-related regions at the feature level. Subsequent temporal modeling
and policy optimization are then performed. This design, centered on
interpretable cross-modal alignment and region reweighting, reduces dependency
on specific acoustic fingerprints. Experimental results demonstrate that AGVP
improves both navigation efficiency and robustness while achieving superior
cross-scenario generalization on previously unheard sounds.

Motivation: 当前音频语言建模领域将音频理解和文本到音频生成作为独立任务处理，缺乏统一框架来支持高级多模态推理，这是实现真正多模态智能的关键步骤。

Method: 提出UALM统一框架，包括UALM-Gen直接预测音频token的文本到音频生成模型，以及UALM-Reason利用文本和音频进行中间推理的多模态推理模型，通过数据混合、训练配方和推理技术实现统一。

Abstract: Recent advances in the audio language modeling (ALM) domain tackle audio
understanding and text-to-audio generation as separate tasks. Very few studies
attempt to unify these tasks -- an essential step toward advanced multimodal
reasoning. This paper introduces U}nified Audio Language Model (UALM), which
aims to unify audio understanding, text-to-audio generation, and multimodal
reasoning in a single model. To achieve this goal, we first present UALM-Gen, a
text-to-audio language model that directly predicts audio tokens and is
comparable to state-of-the-art diffusion-based models. We then demonstrate,
using proper data blending, training recipes, and inference techniques, that
our single UALM model matches the quality of state-of-the-art specialized
models in audio understanding, text-to-audio generation, and text reasoning.
Furthermore, we present UALM-Reason, a multimodal reasoning model that utilizes
both text and audio in the intermediate thinking steps to facilitate complex
generation tasks. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration in audio
research of cross-modal generative reasoning, with its effectiveness confirmed
by subjective evaluations.

TL;DR: Audio Palette是一个基于扩散变换器的模型，通过引入四个时变控制信号（响度、音高、频谱质心和音色）实现细粒度的可控音频生成，同时保持高质量的音频输出和文本语义对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散生成模型在文本到音频合成中细粒度声学控制的挑战，填补开源研究中可控音频生成的"控制空白"。

Method: 扩展Stable Audio Open架构，引入四个时变控制信号，使用低秩适应（LoRA）在AudioSet子集上进行高效微调，仅需训练0.85%的原始参数。采用基于序列的条件机制、内存优化和三尺度无分类器引导机制。

Result: 实现了细粒度、可解释的声音属性控制，在保持高音频质量的同时，FAD和LAION-CLAP等标准指标与原始基线模型相当。

Conclusion: 为开源环境中的可控声音设计和表演性音频合成建立了坚实基础，实现了更加以艺术家为中心的工作流程。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have enabled
high-quality text-to-audio synthesis, but fine-grained acoustic control remains
a significant challenge in open-source research. We present Audio Palette, a
diffusion transformer (DiT) based model that extends the Stable Audio Open
architecture to address this "control gap" in controllable audio generation.
Unlike prior approaches that rely solely on semantic conditioning, Audio
Palette introduces four time-varying control signals: loudness, pitch, spectral
centroid, and timbre, for precise and interpretable manipulation of acoustic
features. The model is efficiently adapted for the nuanced domain of Foley
synthesis using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on a curated subset of AudioSet,
requiring only 0.85 percent of the original parameters to be trained.
Experiments demonstrate that Audio Palette achieves fine-grained, interpretable
control of sound attributes. Crucially, it accomplishes this novel
controllability while maintaining high audio quality and strong semantic
alignment to text prompts, with performance on standard metrics such as Frechet
Audio Distance (FAD) and LAION-CLAP scores remaining comparable to the original
baseline model. We provide a scalable, modular pipeline for audio research,
emphasizing sequence-based conditioning, memory efficiency, and a three-scale
classifier-free guidance mechanism for nuanced inference-time control. This
work establishes a robust foundation for controllable sound design and
performative audio synthesis in open-source settings, enabling a more
artist-centric workflow.

Abstract: The rapid development of auditory attention decoding (AAD) based on
electroencephalography (EEG) signals offers the possibility EEG-driven target
speaker extraction. However, how to effectively utilize the target-speaker
common information between EEG and speech remains an unresolved problem. In
this paper, we propose a model for brain-controlled speaker extraction, which
utilizes the EEG recorded from the listener to extract the target speech. In
order to effectively extract information from EEG signals, we derive
multi-scale time--frequency features and further incorporate cortical
topological structures that are selectively engaged during the task. Moreover,
to effectively exploit the non-Euclidean structure of EEG signals and capture
their global features, the graph convolutional networks and self-attention
mechanism are used in the EEG encoder. In addition, to make full use of the
fused EEG and speech feature and preserve global context and capture speech
rhythm and prosody, we introduce MossFormer2 which combines MossFormer and
RNN-Free Recurrent as separator. Experimental results on both the public
Cocktail Party and KUL dataset in this paper show that our TFGA-Net model
significantly outper-forms the state-of-the-art method in certain objective
evaluation metrics. The source code is available at:

TL;DR: 本文提出内容匿名化方法，通过上下文重写转录文本来消除说话者特定风格，保护长音频中的隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语音匿名化技术在短语音中有效，但在长音频中，攻击者可以利用说话者的词汇、句法和表达习惯重新识别说话者，即使声音被完全伪装。

Method: 在ASR-TTS流程中执行上下文转录重写，消除说话者特定风格同时保留语义。使用释义作为防御内容攻击的有效方法。

Result: 在长格式电话对话场景中验证了内容攻击对语音匿名化语音的有效性，并展示了基于内容的匿名化方法能够降低这种风险。

Conclusion: 释义是防御内容攻击的有效方法，建议利益相关者采用此步骤以确保长音频中的匿名性。

Abstract: Voice anonymization techniques have been found to successfully obscure a
speaker's acoustic identity in short, isolated utterances in benchmarks such as
the VoicePrivacy Challenge. In practice, however, utterances seldom occur in
isolation: long-form audio is commonplace in domains such as interviews, phone
calls, and meetings. In these cases, many utterances from the same speaker are
available, which pose a significantly greater privacy risk: given multiple
utterances from the same speaker, an attacker could exploit an individual's
vocabulary, syntax, and turns of phrase to re-identify them, even when their
voice is completely disguised. To address this risk, we propose new content
anonymization approaches. Our approach performs a contextual rewriting of the
transcripts in an ASR-TTS pipeline to eliminate speaker-specific style while
preserving meaning. We present results in a long-form telephone conversation
setting demonstrating the effectiveness of a content-based attack on
voice-anonymized speech. Then we show how the proposed content-based
anonymization methods can mitigate this risk while preserving speech utility.
Overall, we find that paraphrasing is an effective defense against
content-based attacks and recommend that stakeholders adopt this step to ensure
anonymity in long-form audio.
