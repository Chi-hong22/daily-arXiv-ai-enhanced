Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has drawn tremendous attention recently. Many
works focus on using modular deep neural networks to construct the end-to-end
archi-tecture. However, whether using powerful large language models (LLM),
especially multi-modality Vision Language Models (VLM) could benefit the
end-to-end driving tasks remain a question. In our work, we demonstrate that
combining end-to-end architectural design and knowledgeable VLMs yield
impressive performance on the driving tasks. It is worth noting that our method
only uses a single camera and is the best camera-only solution across the
leaderboard, demonstrating the effectiveness of vision-based driving approach
and the potential for end-to-end driving tasks.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive
generalization across tasks using images and text modalities. While their
extension to video has enabled tasks such as video question answering and video
captioning, their pixel-level visual grounding abilities are less studied. In
this work, we raise the pertinent question of whether motion is used in
pixel-level visual grounding and whether video MLLMs can segment objects based
on natural language expressions describing their motion patterns. We identify
the shortcomings in the current benchmarks, where we show that a single frame
can often suffice for capturing the motion referring expression without any
temporal reasoning. To address this, we introduce four motion-centric probing
techniques, particularly designed for the visual grounding task, to study video
MLLMs' ability to identify true motion from a fake one and their ability to
grasp the motion order. Consequently, we provide a motion-centric benchmark,
MoCentric-Bench. It ensures that video MLLMs are evaluated towards leveraging
the interaction between motion and language rather than being dominated by
static appearance cues emphasized in existing visual grounding datasets. We
further establish strong single-image baselines that are on par with or
outperform prior methods. Finally, we explore simple motion-centric adaptation
techniques that provide state-of-the-art performance on our MoCentric-Bench.
Our motion-centric benchmark, evaluation and findings challenge future models
to improve dense spatiotemporal grounding and pixel-level understanding within
videos. Code and datasets will be made publicly available at

Abstract: Colon cancer also known as Colorectal cancer, is one of the most malignant
types of cancer worldwide. Early-stage detection of colon cancer is highly
crucial to prevent its deterioration. This research presents a hybrid
multi-scale deep learning architecture that synergizes capsule networks, graph
attention mechanisms, transformer modules, and residual learning to advance
colon cancer classification on the Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological
Image Dataset (LC25000) dataset. The proposed model in this paper utilizes the
HG-TNet model that introduces a hybrid architecture that joins strength points
in transformers and convolutional neural networks to capture multi-scale
features in histopathological images. Mainly, a transformer branch extracts
global contextual bonds by partitioning the image into patches by
convolution-based patch embedding and then processing these patches through a
transformer encoder. Analogously, a dedicated CNN branch captures fine-grained,
local details through successive Incorporation these diverse features, combined
with a self-supervised rotation prediction objective, produce a robust
diagnostic representation that surpasses standard architectures in performance.
Results show better performance not only in accuracy or loss function but also
in these algorithms by utilizing capsule networks to preserve spatial orders
and realize how each element individually combines and forms whole structures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决主动脉狭窄诊断中超声心动图资源有限的问题，特别是在农村和服务不足地区，点式护理超声受限于操作者专业知识和视图选择困难

Method: 采用强化学习驱动的主动视频采集框架，动态选择每个患者最具信息量的超声心动图视频，持续评估是否需要额外成像

Result: 在2,572名患者数据上测试，使用仅47%的视频量就实现了80.6%的分类准确率

Conclusion: 主动特征采集方法能够提高主动脉狭窄诊断效率，使超声心动图评估更加高效、可扩展和个性化

Abstract: Aortic stenosis (AS) is a life-threatening condition caused by a narrowing of
the aortic valve, leading to impaired blood flow. Despite its high prevalence,
access to echocardiography (echo), the gold-standard diagnostic tool, is often
limited due to resource constraints, particularly in rural and underserved
areas. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) offers a more accessible alternative
but is restricted by operator expertise and the challenge of selecting the most
relevant imaging views. To address this, we propose a reinforcement learning
(RL)-driven active video acquisition framework that dynamically selects each
patient's most informative echo videos. Unlike traditional methods that rely on
a fixed set of videos, our approach continuously evaluates whether additional
imaging is needed, optimizing both accuracy and efficiency. Tested on data from
2,572 patients, our method achieves 80.6% classification accuracy while using
only 47% of the echo videos compared to a full acquisition. These results
demonstrate the potential of active feature acquisition to enhance AS
diagnosis, making echocardiographic assessments more efficient, scalable, and
personalized. Our source code is available at:

Abstract: There is a growing interest in the development of lidar-based autonomous
mobility and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). To operate and research
on lidar data, researchers often develop code specific to application niche.
This approach leads to duplication of efforts across studies that, in many
cases, share multiple methodological steps such as data input/output (I/O),
pre/post processing, and common algorithms in multi-stage solutions. Moreover,
slight changes in data, algorithms, and/or research focus may force major
revisions in the code. To address these challenges, we present LiGuard, an
open-source software framework that allows researchers to: 1) rapidly develop
code for their lidar-based projects by providing built-in support for data I/O,
pre/post processing, and commonly used algorithms, 2) interactively
add/remove/reorder custom algorithms and adjust their parameters, and 3)
visualize results for classification, detection, segmentation, and tracking
tasks. Moreover, because it creates all the code files in structured
directories, it allows easy sharing of entire projects or even the individual
components to be reused by other researchers. The effectiveness of LiGuard is
demonstrated via case studies.

Abstract: LiDAR-based perception in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), for tasks
such as object detection, tracking, and semantic and instance segmentation, is
predominantly solved by deep neural network models which often require
large-scale labeled datasets during training to achieve generalization.
However, creating these datasets is costly. time consuming and require human
labor before the datasets are ready for training models. This hinders
scalability of the LiDAR-based perception systems in ITS. Sim2Real learning
offers scalable alternative, however, its effectiveness is dependent on the
fidelity of the source simulation(s) to real-world, in terms of environment
structure, actor dynamics, and sensor emulations. In response, this paper
introduces a rigorous and reproducible methodology for creating large-scale,
high-quality synthetic datasets using High-Fidelity Digital Twins (HiFi DTs).
The proposed workflow outlines the steps, tools, and best practices for
digitally replicating real-world environments, encompassing static geometry
modeling, road infrastructure replication, and dynamic traffic scenario
generation. Leveraging open-source and readily available resources such as
satellite imagery and OpenStreetMap data, alongside specific sensor
configurations, this paper provides practical, detailed guidance for
constructing robust synthetic environments. These environments subsequently
facilitate scalable, cost-effective, and diverse dataset generation, forming a
reliable foundation for robust Sim2Real learning.

Abstract: Sim2Real domain transfer offers a cost-effective and scalable approach for
developing LiDAR-based perception (e.g., object detection, tracking,
segmentation) in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, perception
models trained in simulation often under perform on real-world data due to
distributional shifts. To address this Sim2Real gap, this paper proposes a
high-fidelity digital twin (HiFi DT) framework that incorporates real-world
background geometry, lane-level road topology, and sensor-specific
specifications and placement. We formalize the domain adaptation challenge
underlying Sim2Real learning and present a systematic method for constructing
simulation environments that yield in-domain synthetic data. An off-the-shelf
3D object detector is trained on HiFi DT-generated synthetic data and evaluated
on real data. Our experiments show that the DT-trained model outperforms the
equivalent model trained on real data by 4.8%. To understand this gain, we
quantify distributional alignment between synthetic and real data using
multiple metrics, including Chamfer Distance (CD), Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(MMD), Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), and Fr'echet Distance (FD), at both
raw-input and latent-feature levels. Results demonstrate that HiFi DTs
substantially reduce domain shift and improve generalization across diverse
evaluation scenarios. These findings underscore the significant role of digital
twins in enabling reliable, simulation-based LiDAR perception for real-world
ITS applications.

TL;DR: KG-DG是一个神经符号框架，通过整合视觉变换器和专家指导的符号推理，在糖尿病视网膜病变分类中实现了跨域泛化的显著提升，准确率最高提升6%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学影像中模型在真实世界分布偏移下泛化能力差的问题，特别是在糖尿病视网膜病变分类中的域泛化挑战

Method: 提出神经符号框架KG-DG，整合视觉变换器与基于临床病变本体的符号推理，通过结构化规则特征和视网膜血管分割，采用置信度加权集成策略融合深度视觉表示，最小化域嵌入间的KL散度来对齐高层临床语义

Conclusion: 神经符号集成是构建临床鲁棒、域不变医学AI系统的有前景范式，符号组件不仅是可解释性增强工具，更是有效的正则化器

Abstract: Domain generalization remains a critical challenge in medical imaging, where
models trained on single sources often fail under real-world distribution
shifts. We propose KG-DG, a neuro-symbolic framework for diabetic retinopathy
(DR) classification that integrates vision transformers with expert-guided
symbolic reasoning to enable robust generalization across unseen domains. Our
approach leverages clinical lesion ontologies through structured, rule-based
features and retinal vessel segmentation, fusing them with deep visual
representations via a confidence-weighted integration strategy. The framework
addresses both single-domain generalization (SDG) and multi-domain
generalization (MDG) by minimizing the KL divergence between domain embeddings,
thereby enforcing alignment of high-level clinical semantics. Extensive
experiments across four public datasets (APTOS, EyePACS, Messidor-1,
Messidor-2) demonstrate significant improvements: up to a 5.2% accuracy gain in
cross-domain settings and a 6% improvement over baseline ViT models. Notably,
our symbolic-only model achieves a 63.67% average accuracy in MDG, while the
complete neuro-symbolic integration achieves the highest accuracy compared to
existing published baselines and benchmarks in challenging SDG scenarios.
Ablation studies reveal that lesion-based features (84.65% accuracy)
substantially outperform purely neural approaches, confirming that symbolic
components act as effective regularizers beyond merely enhancing
interpretability. Our findings establish neuro-symbolic integration as a
promising paradigm for building clinically robust, and domain-invariant medical
AI systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STAR是一个快速、稳健的开源框架，用于全切片组织病理学图像的刚性配准，特别适用于连续切片场景，能够处理多种染色类型并在几分钟内完成配准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的序列全切片组织病理学图像配准方法通常依赖复杂的可变形或深度学习方案，这些方法计算密集且难以复现。而轻量级的刚性配准框架虽然足以应对许多连续切片场景，但仍未得到充分开发。

Method: STAR集成了染色条件预处理、分层粗到精相关策略、自适应核缩放和内置质量控制，采用刚性配准方法处理异质组织类型和染色方案。

Conclusion: STAR作为一个开源轻量级工具，提供了一个可复现的基线，降低了临床应用的障碍，并为下一代计算病理学的大规模配对数据准备提供了支持。

Abstract: Registration of serial whole-slide histopathological images (WSIs) is
critical for enabling direct comparison across diverse stains and for preparing
paired datasets in artificial intelligence (AI) workflows such as virtual
staining and biomarker prediction. While existing methods often rely on complex
deformable or deep learning approaches that are computationally intensive and
difficult to reproduce, lightweight rigid frameworks-sufficient for many
consecutive-section scenarios-remain underdeveloped. We introduce STAR (Serial
Tissue Alignment for Rigid registration), a fast and robust open-source
framework for multi-WSI alignment. STAR integrates stain-conditioned
preprocessing with a hierarchical coarse-to-fine correlation strategy, adaptive
kernel scaling, and built-in quality control, achieving reliable rigid
registration across heterogeneous tissue types and staining protocols,
including hematoxylin-eosin (H&E), special histochemical stains (e.g., PAS,
PASM, Masson's), and immunohistochemical (IHC) markers (e.g., CD31, KI67).
Evaluated on the ANHIR 2019 and ACROBAT 2022 datasets spanning multiple organs
and scanning conditions, STAR consistently produced stable alignments within
minutes per slide, demonstrating robustness to cross-stain variability and
partial tissue overlap. Beyond benchmarks, we present case studies on H&E-IHC
alignment, construction of multi-IHC panels, and typical failure modes,
underscoring both utility and limitations. Released as an open and lightweight
tool, STAR provides a reproducible baseline that lowers the barrier for
clinical adoption and enables large-scale paired data preparation for
next-generation computational pathology.

Abstract: Multimodal industrial surface defect detection (MISDD) aims to identify and
locate defect in industrial products by fusing RGB and 3D modalities. This
article focuses on modality-missing problems caused by uncertain sensors
availability in MISDD. In this context, the fusion of multiple modalities
encounters several troubles, including learning mode transformation and
information vacancy. To this end, we first propose cross-modal prompt learning,
which includes: i) the cross-modal consistency prompt serves the establishment
of information consistency of dual visual modalities; ii) the modality-specific
prompt is inserted to adapt different input patterns; iii) the missing-aware
prompt is attached to compensate for the information vacancy caused by dynamic
modalities-missing. In addition, we propose symmetric contrastive learning,
which utilizes text modality as a bridge for fusion of dual vision modalities.
Specifically, a paired antithetical text prompt is designed to generate binary
text semantics, and triple-modal contrastive pre-training is offered to
accomplish multimodal learning. Experiment results show that our proposed
method achieves 73.83% I-AUROC and 93.05% P-AUROC with a total missing rate 0.7
for RGB and 3D modalities (exceeding state-of-the-art methods 3.84% and 5.58%
respectively), and outperforms existing approaches to varying degrees under
different missing types and rates. The source code will be available at

TL;DR: EdgeAttNet是一种基于U-Net的太阳细丝分割架构，通过引入可学习的边缘图来增强自注意力机制，显著提高了细丝边界和分支的识别精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在H-alpha观测中难以捕捉太阳细丝的精细结构（特别是分支），主要原因是长距离依赖建模能力和空间细节处理能力有限。

Method: 在U-Net骨干网络上引入直接从输入图像推导的可学习边缘图，通过线性变换注意力Key和Query矩阵来引导自注意力机制，将结构先验显式整合到注意力计算中。

Result: 在MAGFILO数据集上，EdgeAttNet超越了U-Net和其他基于U-Net的transformer基线，实现了更高的分割精度和显著更好的细丝分支识别能力，同时推理速度更快。

Conclusion: 通过将边缘结构先验整合到注意力机制中，EdgeAttNet有效提升了空间敏感性和分割精度，同时减少了可训练参数数量，适合实际部署应用。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of solar filaments in H-alpha observations is critical
for determining filament chirality, a key factor in the behavior of Coronal
Mass Ejections (CMEs). However, existing methods often fail to capture
fine-scale filament structures, particularly barbs, due to a limited ability to
model long-range dependencies and spatial detail.
  We propose EdgeAttNet, a segmentation architecture built on a U-Net backbone
by introducing a novel, learnable edge map derived directly from the input
image. This edge map is incorporated into the model by linearly transforming
the attention Key and Query matrices with the edge information, thereby guiding
the self-attention mechanism at the network's bottleneck to more effectively
capture filament boundaries and barbs. By explicitly integrating this
structural prior into the attention computations, EdgeAttNet enhances spatial
sensitivity and segmentation accuracy while reducing the number of trainable
parameters.
  Trained end-to-end, EdgeAttNet outperforms U-Net and other U-Net-based
transformer baselines on the MAGFILO dataset. It achieves higher segmentation
accuracy and significantly better recognition of filament barbs, with faster
inference performance suitable for practical deployment.

Abstract: Accurate short-horizon trajectory prediction is pivotal for safe and reliable
autonomous driving, yet existing vision-language models (VLMs) often fail to
effectively ground their reasoning in scene dynamics and domain knowledge. To
address this challenge, this paper introduces KEPT, a knowledge-enhanced VLM
framework that predicts ego trajectories directly from consecutive front-view
driving frames. KEPT couples a temporal frequency-spatial fusion (TFSF) video
encoder, trained via self-supervised learning with hard-negative mining, with a
scalable k-means + HNSW retrieval stack that supplies scene-aligned exemplars.
Retrieved priors are embedded into chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts with explicit
planning constraints, while a triple-stage fine-tuning schedule incrementally
aligns the language head to metric spatial cues, physically feasible motion,
and temporally conditioned front-view planning. Evaluated on nuScenes dataset,
KEPT achieves state-of-the-art performance across open-loop protocols: under
NoAvg, it achieves 0.70m average L2 with a 0.21\% collision rate; under TemAvg
with lightweight ego status, it attains 0.31m average L2 and a 0.07\% collision
rate. Ablation studies show that all three fine-tuning stages contribute
complementary benefits, and that using Top-2 retrieved exemplars yields the
best accuracy-safety trade-off. The k-means-clustered HNSW index delivers
sub-millisecond retrieval latency, supporting practical deployment. These
results indicate that retrieval-augmented, CoT-guided VLMs offer a promising,
data-efficient pathway toward interpretable and trustworthy autonomous driving.

TL;DR: Strefer是一个合成指令数据生成框架，旨在为视频大语言模型提供时空参考和推理能力，通过伪标注细粒度视频元数据来增强模型对时空参考的理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型在粗粒度理解方面表现良好，但在细粒度时空推理方面存在困难，特别是在处理基于时间的事件参考和手势线索的空间锚定时。

Method: 使用数据引擎伪标注时间密集的细粒度视频元数据，以结构化方式捕获丰富的空间和时间信息，包括主体、对象、位置掩码、动作描述和时间线。

Result: 实验评估显示，使用Strefer生成数据训练的模型在需要时空消歧的任务上优于基线模型，并展现出增强的时空感知推理能力。

Conclusion: Strefer为感知基础的指令调优视频大语言模型建立了新的基础，无需使用专有模型、昂贵的人工标注或大量新视频标注。

Abstract: Next-generation AI companions must go beyond general video understanding to
resolve spatial and temporal references in dynamic, real-world environments.
Existing Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs), while capable of
coarse-level comprehension, struggle with fine-grained, spatiotemporal
reasoning, especially when user queries rely on time-based event references for
temporal anchoring, or gestural cues for spatial anchoring to clarify object
references and positions. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce Strefer, a
synthetic instruction data generation framework designed to equip Video LLMs
with spatiotemporal referring and reasoning capabilities. Strefer produces
diverse instruction-tuning data using a data engine that pseudo-annotates
temporally dense, fine-grained video metadata, capturing rich spatial and
temporal information in a structured manner, including subjects, objects, their
locations as masklets, and their action descriptions and timelines. Our
approach enhances the ability of Video LLMs to interpret spatial and temporal
references, fostering more versatile, space-time-aware reasoning essential for
real-world AI companions. Without using proprietary models, costly human
annotation, or the need to annotate large volumes of new videos, experimental
evaluations show that models trained with data produced by Strefer outperform
baselines on tasks requiring spatial and temporal disambiguation. Additionally,
these models exhibit enhanced space-time-aware reasoning, establishing a new
foundation for perceptually grounded, instruction-tuned Video LLMs.

*Xianbao Hou,Yonghao He,Zeyd Boukhers,John See,Hu Su,Wei Sui,Cong Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstaDA是一个无需训练的双代理系统，通过文本代理和图像代理协同工作来增强实例分割数据集，在LVIS 1.0验证集上取得了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实例分割数据标注成本高、类别不平衡的问题，现有方法缺乏大语言模型与扩散模型的深度协作，未能充分利用现有训练数据信息。

Method: 提出双代理系统：文本代理(T-Agent)通过Prompt Rethink机制迭代优化提示词，促进LLM与扩散模型协作；图像代理(I-Agent)基于训练图像生成新实例来丰富数据分布。两个代理都是独立自动化的流程。

Result: 在LVIS 1.0验证集上，相比基线方法，box AP提升+4.0，mask AP提升+3.3；相比领先模型DiverGen，box AP提升+0.3，mask AP提升+0.1，在常见类别上表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: InstaDA通过创新的双代理架构有效解决了实例分割数据增强问题，实现了性能的显著提升，证明了LLM与扩散模型深度协作的价值。

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality instance segmentation data is challenging due to the
labor-intensive nature of the annotation process and significant class
imbalances within datasets. Recent studies have utilized the integration of
Copy-Paste and diffusion models to create more diverse datasets. However, these
studies often lack deep collaboration between large language models (LLMs) and
diffusion models, and underutilize the rich information within the existing
training data. To address these limitations, we propose InstaDA, a novel,
training-free Dual-Agent system designed to augment instance segmentation
datasets. First, we introduce a Text-Agent (T-Agent) that enhances data
diversity through collaboration between LLMs and diffusion models. This agent
features a novel Prompt Rethink mechanism, which iteratively refines prompts
based on the generated images. This process not only fosters collaboration but
also increases image utilization and optimizes the prompts themselves.
Additionally, we present an Image-Agent (I-Agent) aimed at enriching the
overall data distribution. This agent augments the training set by generating
new instances conditioned on the training images. To ensure practicality and
efficiency, both agents operate as independent and automated workflows,
enhancing usability. Experiments conducted on the LVIS 1.0 validation set
indicate that InstaDA achieves significant improvements, with an increase of
+4.0 in box average precision (AP) and +3.3 in mask AP compared to the
baseline. Furthermore, it outperforms the leading model, DiverGen, by +0.3 in
box AP and +0.1 in mask AP, with a notable +0.7 gain in box AP on common
categories and mask AP gains of +0.2 on common categories and +0.5 on frequent
categories.

Motivation: 传统的基于原型的方法在少样本医学图像分割中通常为支持图像生成单一全局原型来匹配查询图像，忽略了类内变化，导致性能受限。

Method: 提出SPENet网络，包含两个核心模块：1）多级原型生成模块同时生成全局原型和自适应数量的局部原型；2）查询引导的局部原型增强模块利用查询图像指导来精炼支持原型，减少支持-查询图像差异的负面影响。

Result: 在三个公共医学数据集上的大量实验表明，SPENet超越了现有的最先进方法，取得了优越的性能。

Conclusion: SPENet通过多粒度原型匹配和查询引导的原型增强，有效解决了少样本医学图像分割中的类内变化问题，显著提升了分割性能。

Abstract: Few-Shot Medical Image Segmentation (FSMIS) aims to segment novel classes of
medical objects using only a few labeled images. Prototype-based methods have
made significant progress in addressing FSMIS. However, they typically generate
a single global prototype for the support image to match with the query image,
overlooking intra-class variations. To address this issue, we propose a
Self-guided Prototype Enhancement Network (SPENet). Specifically, we introduce
a Multi-level Prototype Generation (MPG) module, which enables
multi-granularity measurement between the support and query images by
simultaneously generating a global prototype and an adaptive number of local
prototypes. Additionally, we observe that not all local prototypes in the
support image are beneficial for matching, especially when there are
substantial discrepancies between the support and query images. To alleviate
this issue, we propose a Query-guided Local Prototype Enhancement (QLPE)
module, which adaptively refines support prototypes by incorporating guidance
from the query image, thus mitigating the negative effects of such
discrepancies. Extensive experiments on three public medical datasets
demonstrate that SPENet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods,
achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Extracting small objects from remote sensing imagery plays a vital role in
various applications, including urban planning, environmental monitoring, and
disaster management. While current research primarily focuses on small object
detection, instance segmentation for small objects remains underexplored, with
no dedicated datasets available. This gap stems from the technical challenges
and high costs of pixel-level annotation for small objects. While the Segment
Anything Model (SAM) demonstrates impressive zero-shot generalization, its
performance on small-object segmentation deteriorates significantly, largely
due to the coarse 1/16 feature resolution that causes severe loss of fine
spatial details. To this end, we propose SOPSeg, a prompt-based framework
specifically designed for small object segmentation in remote sensing imagery.
It incorporates a region-adaptive magnification strategy to preserve
fine-grained details, and employs a customized decoder that integrates edge
prediction and progressive refinement for accurate boundary delineation.
Moreover, we introduce a novel prompting mechanism tailored to the oriented
bounding boxes widely adopted in remote sensing applications. SOPSeg
outperforms existing methods in small object segmentation and facilitates
efficient dataset construction for remote sensing tasks. We further construct a
comprehensive small object instance segmentation dataset based on SODA-A, and
will release both the model and dataset to support future research.

Abstract: Recent studies on deep watermarking have predominantly focused on
in-processing watermarking, which integrates the watermarking process into
image generation. However, post-processing watermarking, which embeds
watermarks after image generation, offers more flexibility. It can be applied
to outputs from any generative model (e.g. GANs, diffusion models) without
needing access to the model's internal structure. It also allows users to embed
unique watermarks into individual images. Therefore, this study focuses on
post-processing watermarking and enhances its robustness by incorporating an
ensemble attack network during training. We construct various versions of
attack networks using CNN and Transformer in both spatial and frequency domains
to investigate how each combination influences the robustness of the
watermarking model. Our results demonstrate that combining a CNN-based attack
network in the spatial domain with a Transformer-based attack network in the
frequency domain yields the highest robustness in watermarking models.
Extensive evaluation on the WAVES benchmark, using average bit accuracy as the
metric, demonstrates that our ensemble attack network significantly enhances
the robustness of baseline watermarking methods under various stress tests. In
particular, for the Regeneration Attack defined in WAVES, our method improves
StegaStamp by 18.743%. The code is released

provides MES classification and lesion tags. Compared with baselines, our
approach improves caption quality and MES classification accuracy, supporting

TL;DR: 研究发现大型视觉语言模型(LVLMs)存在错误地将文本输入视为图像内容的问题，通过识别特定的前馈网络神经元(VA神经元)来检测视觉缺失，并提出方法来修正输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在处理视觉和文本输入时，经常错误地将缺乏视觉证据的文本输入视为图像的一部分，导致错误响应。

Method: 识别特定的前馈网络神经元(VA神经元)来检测视觉缺失，开发检测模块分类输入标记是否视觉接地，并通过重新解释问题提示或替换检测到的缺失标记来优化输出。

Result: 实验表明该方法有效缓解了模型错误假设文本输入视觉存在的倾向，并在各种LVLMs中具有通用性。

Conclusion: 通过识别VA神经元并基于其激活模式开发检测模块，可以显著改善LVLMs在处理视觉缺失文本输入时的性能。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) generate contextually relevant responses
by jointly interpreting visual and textual inputs. However, our finding reveals
they often mistakenly perceive text inputs lacking visual evidence as being
part of the image, leading to erroneous responses. In light of this finding, we
probe whether LVLMs possess an internal capability to determine if textual
concepts are grounded in the image, and discover a specific subset of
Feed-Forward Network (FFN) neurons, termed Visual Absence-aware (VA) neurons,
that consistently signal the visual absence through a distinctive activation
pattern. Leveraging these patterns, we develop a detection module that
systematically classifies whether an input token is visually grounded. Guided
by its prediction, we propose a method to refine the outputs by reinterpreting
question prompts or replacing the detected absent tokens during generation.
Extensive experiments show that our method effectively mitigates the models'
tendency to falsely presume the visual presence of text input and its
generality across various LVLMs.

Conclusion: 背景语义在行人重识别中具有重要价值，联合建模前景和背景信息的双分支框架能够有效提升模型性能，特别是在处理复杂遮挡场景时

Abstract: Person re-identification faces two core challenges: precisely locating the
foreground target while suppressing background noise and extracting
fine-grained features from the target region. Numerous visual-only approaches
address these issues by partitioning an image and applying attention modules,
yet they rely on costly manual annotations and struggle with complex
occlusions. Recent multimodal methods, motivated by CLIP, introduce semantic
cues to guide visual understanding. However, they focus solely on foreground
information, but overlook the potential value of background cues. Inspired by
human perception, we argue that background semantics are as important as the
foreground semantics in ReID, as humans tend to eliminate background
distractions while focusing on target appearance. Therefore, this paper
proposes an end-to-end framework that jointly models foreground and background
information within a dual-branch cross-modal feature extraction pipeline. To
help the network distinguish between the two domains, we propose an
intra-semantic alignment and inter-semantic adversarial learning strategy.
Specifically, we align visual and textual features that share the same
semantics across domains, while simultaneously penalizing similarity between
foreground and background features to enhance the network's discriminative
power. This strategy drives the model to actively suppress noisy background
regions and enhance attention toward identity-relevant foreground cues.
Comprehensive experiments on two holistic and two occluded ReID benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method, with
results that match or surpass those of current state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Accurate skin-lesion segmentation remains a key technical challenge for

segmentation that achieves high precision through hierarchical feature
extraction and multi-scale context aggregation. The encoder stacks depth-wise
Mobile Inverted Bottleneck blocks to curb computation, inserts a
bottleneck-level cross-scale token-mixing unit to exchange information between

Conclusion: 提出的动态条件训练范式有效解决了多任务扩散模型中的条件控制问题，通过动态条件生成和时间信息嵌入显著提升了模型在病态多任务场景中的性能。

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have made impressive progress in the field of
image processing, but the characteristics of constructing data distribution
pathways make it difficult to exploit the intrinsic correlation between tasks
in multi-task scenarios, which is even worse in ill-posed tasks with a lack of
training data. In addition, traditional static condition control makes it
difficult for networks to learn in multi-task scenarios with its dynamically
evolving characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic
conditional double diffusion bridge training paradigm to build a general
framework for ill-posed multi-tasks. Firstly, this paradigm decouples the
diffusion and condition generation processes, avoiding the dependence of the
diffusion model on supervised data in ill-posed tasks. Secondly, generated by
the same noise schedule, dynamic conditions are used to gradually adjust their
statistical characteristics, naturally embed time-related information, and
reduce the difficulty of network learning. We analyze the learning objectives
of the network under different conditional forms in the single-step denoising
process and compare the changes in its attention weights in the network,
demonstrating the superiority of our dynamic conditions. Taking dehazing and
visible-infrared fusion as typical ill-posed multi-task scenarios, we achieve
the best performance in multiple indicators on public datasets. The code has
been publicly released at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DCDB-D3C2.

Abstract: Handwritten characters can be trickier to classify due to their complex and
cursive nature compared to simple and non-cursive characters. We present an
external classifier along with a Generative Adversarial Network that can
classify highly cursive and complex characters. The generator network produces
fake handwritten character images, which are then used to augment the training
data after adding adversarially perturbed noise and achieving a confidence
score above a threshold with the discriminator network. The results show that
the accuracy of convolutional neural networks decreases as character complexity
increases, but our proposed model, ADA-GAN, remains more robust and effective
for both cursive and complex characters.

Conclusion: 这种从通用生成模型转移3D表征到专业医学任务的方法具有广阔的潜力，有力解决医学图像领域的标注数据稀缺问题

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms pose a significant clinical risk yet are difficult to
detect, delineate and model due to limited annotated 3D data. We propose a
cross-domain feature-transfer approach that leverages the latent geometric
embeddings learned by TRELLIS, a generative model trained on large-scale
non-medical 3D datasets, to augment neural networks for aneurysm analysis. By
replacing conventional point normals or mesh descriptors with TRELLIS surface
features, we systematically enhance three downstream tasks: (i) classifying
aneurysms versus healthy vessels in the Intra3D dataset, (ii) segmenting
aneurysm and vessel regions on 3D meshes, and (iii) predicting time-evolving
blood-flow fields using a graph neural network on the AnXplore dataset. Our
experiments show that the inclusion of these features yields strong gains in
accuracy, F1-score and segmentation quality over state-of-the-art baselines,
and reduces simulation error by 15\%. These results illustrate the broader
potential of transferring 3D representations from general-purpose generative
models to specialized medical tasks.

Method: 提出后门投毒攻击方法，将欺骗攻击的人脸图像特征嵌入到活体人脸图像中，不引起可察觉的视觉变化

Result: 在公共数据集上的实验表明，该方法对现有欺骗攻击检测系统构成实际威胁

Conclusion: 该方法展示了人脸反欺骗检测中后门投毒的潜在威胁，特定欺骗攻击能够成功绕过检测

Abstract: Face recognition systems are robust against environmental changes and noise,
and thus may be vulnerable to illegal authentication attempts using user face
photos, such as spoofing attacks. To prevent such spoofing attacks, it is
crucial to discriminate whether the input image is a live user image or a
spoofed image prior to the face recognition process. Most existing spoofing
attack detection methods utilize deep learning, which necessitates a
substantial amount of training data. Consequently, if malicious data is
injected into a portion of the training dataset, a specific spoofing attack may
be erroneously classified as live, leading to false positives.In this paper, we
propose a novel backdoor poisoning attack method to demonstrate the latent
threat of backdoor poisoning within face anti-spoofing detection. The proposed
method enables certain spoofing attacks to bypass detection by embedding
features extracted from the spoofing attack's face image into a live face image
without inducing any perceptible visual alterations.Through experiments
conducted on public datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method
constitutes a realistic threat to existing spoofing attack detection systems.

*Jialu Li,Chen Wu,Meiqi Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAIM-Net是一个时间序列变化检测网络，通过从变化时刻推断变化区域，确保变化区域和变化时刻结果的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法将变化区域检测和变化时刻识别作为独立任务处理，但变化区域可以从变化时刻推断出来，因此需要确保两者结果的一致性。

Method: CAIM-Net包含三个关键步骤：差异提取与增强、粗粒度变化时刻提取、细粒度变化时刻提取与变化区域推断。使用轻量级编码器提取差异特征，通过边界增强卷积放大特征，进行时空相关性分析，最后利用多尺度时间CAM模块推断变化区域。

Result: 该方法能够同时指示变化发生的位置和时间，确保变化区域和变化时刻检测结果的一致性。

Conclusion: CAIM-Net通过从变化时刻推断变化区域的方法，有效解决了时间序列变化检测中变化区域和变化时刻结果不一致的问题，为生态系统动态监测提供了更可靠的技术支持。

Abstract: Time series change detection is a critical task for exploring ecosystem
dynamics using time series remote sensing images, because it can simultaneously
indicate where and when change occur. While deep learning has shown excellent
performance in this domain, it continues to approach change area detection and
change moment identification as distinct tasks. Given that change area can be
inferred from change moment, we propose a time series change detection network,
named CAIM-Net (Change Area Inference from Moment Network), to ensure
consistency between change area and change moment results. CAIM-Net infers
change area from change moment based on the intrinsic relationship between time
series analysis and spatial change detection. The CAIM-Net comprises three key
steps: Difference Extraction and Enhancement, Coarse Change Moment Extraction,
and Fine Change Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference. In the Difference
Extraction and Enhancement, a lightweight encoder with batch dimension stacking
is designed to rapidly extract difference features. Subsequently, boundary
enhancement convolution is applied to amplify these difference features. In the
Coarse Change Moment Extraction, the enhanced difference features from the
first step are used to spatiotemporal correlation analysis, and then two
distinct methods are employed to determine coarse change moments. In the Fine
Change Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference, a multiscale temporal Class
Activation Mapping (CAM) module first increases the weight of the
change-occurring moment from coarse change moments. Then the weighted change
moment is used to infer change area based on the fact that pixels with the
change moment must have undergone a change.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于梯度自反思的影响感知对比解码方法，通过分析不同类型token的影响来检测视觉对象token，无需额外资源即可同时缓解多模态大语言模型中的文本-视觉偏差和共现偏差


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型存在文本-视觉偏差和共现偏差导致的幻觉问题，现有方法缺乏对实例间偏差水平波动的理解，需要一种无需额外资源的方法来同时缓解这两种偏差

Method: 使用基于梯度的自反思方法估计视觉、提示和先前输出等不同类型token的影响，检测对象相关的视觉token，并将其整合到影响感知的对比解码框架中

Result: 在LLaVA-QA90上实现了高达92%的准确率提升，有效减少了幻觉现象

Conclusion: 该方法能够在不依赖额外资源的情况下，有效缓解多模态大语言模型中的文本-视觉偏差和共现偏差，显著提升模型性能

Abstract: Hallucinations in multimodal large language model are caused by the
text-visual bias and the co-occurrence bias. The former reflects an
over-reliance on text information in the decision-making process, while the
latter arises from the statistical object-pairing patterns abstracted from the
training data. Existing mitigation methods heuristically address these biases
without understanding the fluctuating bias level across the instances. We first
propose estimating the influence of respective token types (visual, prompt, and
previous outputs) using a gradient-based self-reflection method. The estimated
token influence further enables the detection of object-related visual tokens
and their integration into an influence-aware contrastive decoding framework to
mitigate both types of biases simultaneously. Our method operates without the
need for additional resources, such as costly fine-tuning, extra models, or
data statistics. Extensive experiments show it effectively reduces
hallucinations, achieving up to a 92% accuracy increase on LLaVA-QA90.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手-物体姿态估计方法存在穿透、接触区域间隙问题，且难以捕捉手部在交互过程中的真实变形。

Method: 将手-物体交互建模为引力场驱动过程，使用基于引力场的扩散桥模拟可变形手部表面与刚性物体的交互，并引入文本语义信息指导引力场构建。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法能有效消除穿透、确保稳定抓握、捕捉真实手部变形，生成物理合理的交互状态。

Conclusion: GravityDB方法成功解决了手-物体交互中的关键挑战，为生成物理合理且语义有意义的交互提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Existing reconstruction or hand-object pose estimation methods are capable of
producing coarse interaction states. However, due to the complex and diverse
geometry of both human hands and objects, these approaches often suffer from
interpenetration or leave noticeable gaps in regions that are supposed to be in
contact. Moreover, the surface of a real human hand undergoes non-negligible
deformations during interaction, which are difficult to capture and represent
with previous methods. To tackle these challenges, we formulate hand-object
interaction as an attraction-driven process and propose a Gravity-Field Based
Diffusion Bridge (GravityDB) to simulate interactions between a deformable hand
surface and rigid objects. Our approach effectively resolves the aforementioned
issues by generating physically plausible interactions that are free of
interpenetration, ensure stable grasping, and capture realistic hand
deformations. Furthermore, we incorporate semantic information from textual
descriptions to guide the construction of the gravitational field, enabling
more semantically meaningful interaction regions. Extensive qualitative and
quantitative experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有脑部MRI预测方法存在三个主要问题：(1)无法明确捕捉结构变化与时间间隔的关系；(2)仅依赖扫描插值，缺乏临床实用性；(3)大多基于2D切片架构，忽略完整3D解剖上下文

Method: 提出TADM-3D模型，结合预训练脑龄估计器(BAE)指导扩散过程，并引入Back-In-Time正则化(BITR)进行双向训练，提高时间准确性

Result: 在OASIS-3数据集上训练和评估，并在NACC外部测试集上验证泛化性能

Conclusion: TADM-3D能够准确预测脑部MRI的进展，通过时间感知机制和3D建模解决了现有方法的局限性

Abstract: Generating realistic MRIs to accurately predict future changes in the
structure of brain is an invaluable tool for clinicians in assessing clinical
outcomes and analysing the disease progression at the patient level. However,
current existing methods present some limitations: (i) some approaches fail to
explicitly capture the relationship between structural changes and time
intervals, especially when trained on age-imbalanced datasets; (ii) others rely
only on scan interpolation, which lack clinical utility, as they generate
intermediate images between timepoints rather than future pathological
progression; and (iii) most approaches rely on 2D slice-based architectures,
thereby disregarding full 3D anatomical context, which is essential for
accurate longitudinal predictions. We propose a 3D Temporally-Aware Diffusion
Model (TADM-3D), which accurately predicts brain progression on MRI volumes. To
better model the relationship between time interval and brain changes, TADM-3D
uses a pre-trained Brain-Age Estimator (BAE) that guides the diffusion model in
the generation of MRIs that accurately reflect the expected age difference
between baseline and generated follow-up scans. Additionally, to further
improve the temporal awareness of TADM-3D, we propose the Back-In-Time
Regularisation (BITR), by training TADM-3D to predict bidirectionally from the
baseline to follow-up (forward), as well as from the follow-up to baseline
(backward). Although predicting past scans has limited clinical applications,
this regularisation helps the model generate temporally more accurate scans. We
train and evaluate TADM-3D on the OASIS-3 dataset, and we validate the
generalisation performance on an external test set from the NACC dataset. The
code will be available upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了两种新颖的损失函数（负中心线损失和简化拓扑损失）来保持生物医学分割中细长结构的连续性，特别针对轴突起始段分割任务中的信号丢失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在生物医学分割任务中，保持细长结构的连续性和长度比体素级精度更重要，特别是对于容易因信号丢失而产生不连续性的轴突起始段分割。

Method: 使用卷积神经网络（CNNs），结合新提出的负中心线损失和简化拓扑损失函数，并讨论了实验设计中的下采样和间距校正等特征来获得连续的分割掩码。

Result: 与标准CNNs和现有拓扑感知损失相比，该方法减少了每个实例的分割不连续性数量，特别是在输入信号缺失的区域，改善了实例长度计算的准确性。

Conclusion: 在损失函数设计中嵌入结构先验可以显著提高生物应用分割的可靠性，特别是在保持细长结构连续性方面。

Abstract: In many biomedical segmentation tasks, the preservation of elongated
structure continuity and length is more important than voxel-wise accuracy. We
propose two novel loss functions, Negative Centerline Loss and Simplified
Topology Loss, that, applied to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), help
preserve connectivity of output instances. Moreover, we discuss characteristics
of experiment design, such as downscaling and spacing correction, that help
obtain continuous segmentation masks. We evaluate our approach on a 3D
light-sheet fluorescence microscopy dataset of axon initial segments (AIS), a
task prone to discontinuity due to signal dropout. Compared to standard CNNs
and existing topology-aware losses, our methods reduce the number of
segmentation discontinuities per instance, particularly in regions with missing
input signal, resulting in improved instance length calculation in downstream
applications. Our findings demonstrate that structural priors embedded in the
loss design can significantly enhance the reliability of segmentation for
biological applications.

Conclusion: Count2Density成功证明了仅使用计数级标注即可训练出具有空间感知能力的密度估计模型，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Crowd density estimation is a well-known computer vision task aimed at
estimating the density distribution of people in an image. The main challenge
in this domain is the reliance on fine-grained location-level annotations,
(i.e. points placed on top of each individual) to train deep networks.
Collecting such detailed annotations is both tedious, time-consuming, and poses
a significant barrier to scalability for real-world applications. To alleviate
this burden, we present Count2Density: a novel pipeline designed to predict
meaningful density maps containing quantitative spatial information using only
count-level annotations (i.e., total number of people) during training. To
achieve this, Count2Density generates pseudo-density maps leveraging past
predictions stored in a Historical Map Bank, thereby reducing confirmation
bias. This bank is initialised using an unsupervised saliency estimator to
provide an initial spatial prior and is iteratively updated with an EMA of
predicted density maps. These pseudo-density maps are obtained by sampling
locations from estimated crowd areas using a hypergeometric distribution, with
the number of samplings determined by the count-level annotations. To further
enhance the spatial awareness of the model, we add a self-supervised
contrastive spatial regulariser to encourage similar feature representations
within crowded regions while maximising dissimilarity with background regions.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
cross-domain adaptation methods and achieves better results than recent
state-of-the-art approaches in semi-supervised settings across several
datasets. Additional analyses validate the effectiveness of each individual
component of our pipeline, confirming the ability of Count2Density to
effectively retrieve spatial information from count-level annotations and
enabling accurate subregion counting.

Conclusion: 军事领域需要大型代表性数据集来进一步评估投毒攻击风险和补丁检测机会；AutoDetect方法为投毒检测提供了简单高效的解决方案，但该领域仍需更多研究。

Abstract: Poisoning attacks pose an increasing threat to the security and robustness of
Artificial Intelligence systems in the military domain. The widespread use of
open-source datasets and pretrained models exacerbates this risk. Despite the
severity of this threat, there is limited research on the application and
detection of poisoning attacks on object detection systems. This is especially
problematic in the military domain, where attacks can have grave consequences.
In this work, we both investigate the effect of poisoning attacks on military
object detectors in practice, and the best approach to detect these attacks. To
support this research, we create a small, custom dataset featuring military
vehicles: MilCivVeh. We explore the vulnerability of military object detectors
for poisoning attacks by implementing a modified version of the BadDet attack:
a patch-based poisoning attack. We then assess its impact, finding that while a
positive attack success rate is achievable, it requires a substantial portion
of the data to be poisoned -- raising questions about its practical
applicability. To address the detection challenge, we test both specialized
poisoning detection methods and anomaly detection methods from the visual
industrial inspection domain. Since our research shows that both classes of
methods are lacking, we introduce our own patch detection method: AutoDetect, a
simple, fast, and lightweight autoencoder-based method. Our method shows
promising results in separating clean from poisoned samples using the
reconstruction error of image slices, outperforming existing methods, while
being less time- and memory-intensive. We urge that the availability of large,
representative datasets in the military domain is a prerequisite to further
evaluate risks of poisoning attacks and opportunities patch detection.

Motivation: 低剂量CT虽然能减少辐射暴露，但会导致噪声增加和图像质量下降。传统降噪方法难以保持图像质量，需要新的解决方案

Method: 使用基于强化学习的编码器-解码器架构，采用先进的后验策略优化(PPO)算法，通过自定义gym环境实时优化降噪策略，基于图像质量反馈进行训练

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异：PSNR达41.87，SSIM达0.9814，RMSE为0.00236；在COVID-19数据集上分类准确率达到94%，比无RL降噪提升4%

Conclusion: 该方法为更安全、更准确的低剂量CT成像提供了有前景的解决方案，在图像质量和诊断准确性方面均有显著提升

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is critical for minimizing radiation
exposure, but it often leads to increased noise and reduced image quality.
Traditional denoising methods, such as iterative optimization or supervised
learning, often fail to preserve image quality. To address these challenges, we
introduce PPORLD-EDNetLDCT, a reinforcement learning-based (RL) approach with
Encoder-Decoder for LDCT. Our method utilizes a dynamic RL-based approach in
which an advanced posterior policy optimization (PPO) algorithm is used to
optimize denoising policies in real time, based on image quality feedback,
trained via a custom gym environment. The experimental results on the low dose
CT image and projection dataset demonstrate that the proposed PPORLD-EDNetLDCT
model outperforms traditional denoising techniques and other DL-based methods,
achieving a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 41.87, a structural similarity index
measure of 0.9814 and a root mean squared error of 0.00236. Moreover, in
NIH-AAPM-Mayo Clinic Low Dose CT Challenge dataset our method achived a PSNR of
41.52, SSIM of 0.9723 and RMSE of 0.0051. Furthermore, we validated the quality
of denoising using a classification task in the COVID-19 LDCT dataset, where
the images processed by our method improved the classification accuracy to
94\%, achieving 4\% higher accuracy compared to denoising without RL-based
denoising. This method offers a promising solution for safer and more accurate
LDCT imaging.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved
natural language understanding and generation, enhancing Human-Computer
Interaction (HCI). However, LLMs are limited to unimodal text processing and
lack the ability to interpret emotional cues from non-verbal signals, hindering
more immersive and empathetic interactions. This work explores integrating
multimodal sentiment perception into LLMs to create emotion-aware agents. We
propose \ours, an AI-based virtual companion that captures multimodal sentiment
cues, enabling emotionally aligned and animated HCI. \ours introduces a
Multimodal Sentiment Perception Network (MSPN) using a cross-modal fusion
transformer and supervised contrastive learning to provide emotional cues.
Additionally, we develop an emotion-aware prompt engineering strategy for
generating empathetic responses and integrate a Text-to-Speech (TTS) system and
animated avatar module for expressive interactions. \ours provides a framework
for emotion-aware agents with applications in companion robotics, social care,
mental health, and human-centered AI.

Conclusion: RTGMFF通过文本生成和多模态融合有效解决了fMRI诊断中的挑战，为脑疾病诊断提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a powerful tool for probing
brain function, yet reliable clinical diagnosis is hampered by low
signal-to-noise ratios, inter-subject variability, and the limited frequency
awareness of prevailing CNN- and Transformer-based models. Moreover, most fMRI
datasets lack textual annotations that could contextualize regional activation
and connectivity patterns. We introduce RTGMFF, a framework that unifies
automatic ROI-level text generation with multimodal feature fusion for
brain-disorder diagnosis. RTGMFF consists of three components: (i) ROI-driven
fMRI text generation deterministically condenses each subject's activation,
connectivity, age, and sex into reproducible text tokens; (ii) Hybrid
frequency-spatial encoder fuses a hierarchical wavelet-mamba branch with a
cross-scale Transformer encoder to capture frequency-domain structure alongside
long-range spatial dependencies; and (iii) Adaptive semantic alignment module
embeds the ROI token sequence and visual features in a shared space, using a
regularized cosine-similarity loss to narrow the modality gap. Extensive
experiments on the ADHD-200 and ABIDE benchmarks show that RTGMFF surpasses
current methods in diagnostic accuracy, achieving notable gains in sensitivity,
specificity, and area under the ROC curve. Code is available at

types, including cubic B\'ezier curves, line segments, circles, and arcs, in a
single forward pass. Optional post-processing steps further refine predictions
without adding complexity. This streamlined design improves robustness to noise
and varying sampling densities, addressing critical challenges in real world
LiDAR and 3D sensing scenarios. PI3DETR sets a new state-of-the-art on the ABC

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有肿瘤合成方法在大空间体积（如乳腺MRI大视野）中表现不佳，常用方法基于小patch，需要高质量的大视野肿瘤合成技术来提升分割模型性能

Method: 使用patch-to-volume自编码器压缩高分辨率MRI到紧凑潜在空间，保持大视野体积分辨率；采用掩码条件扩散模型在选定乳腺组织区域合成乳腺肿瘤

Result: 在大型公共数据集上，提出的高质量肿瘤合成方法使常见分割模型性能提升2-3% Dice分数

Conclusion: SynBT方法能够生成高质量的乳腺MRI肿瘤图像，有效促进肿瘤分割任务，为MRI图像中的肿瘤分割提供益处

Abstract: Synthetic tumors in medical images offer controllable characteristics that
facilitate the training of machine learning models, leading to an improved
segmentation performance. However, the existing methods of tumor synthesis
yield suboptimal performances when tumor occupies a large spatial volume, such
as breast tumor segmentation in MRI with a large field-of-view (FOV), while
commonly used tumor generation methods are based on small patches. In this
paper, we propose a 3D medical diffusion model, called SynBT, to generate
high-quality breast tumor (BT) in contrast-enhanced MRI images. The proposed
model consists of a patch-to-volume autoencoder, which is able to compress the
high-resolution MRIs into compact latent space, while preserving the resolution
of volumes with large FOV. Using the obtained latent space feature vector, a
mask-conditioned diffusion model is used to synthesize breast tumors within
selected regions of breast tissue, resulting in realistic tumor appearances. We
evaluated the proposed method for a tumor segmentation task, which demonstrated
the proposed high-quality tumor synthesis method can facilitate the common
segmentation models with performance improvement of 2-3% Dice Score on a large
public dataset, and therefore provides benefits for tumor segmentation in MRI
images.

*Qihang Zhou,Shibo He,Jiangtao Yan,Wenchao Meng,Jiming Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PointAD+是一个统一的3D异常检测框架，通过结合隐式渲染表示和显式空间表示，将CLIP的2D泛化能力扩展到3D异常检测，在未见过的多样化类别对象上实现零样本检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将CLIP强大的2D泛化能力迁移到3D异常检测领域，解决在未见过的多样化语义类别对象上的3D异常识别问题。

Method: 提出PointAD+框架：1) PointAD利用点-像素对应关系进行隐式3D表示；2) PointAD+引入显式3D表示，通过G-aggregation整合几何信息；3) 分层表示学习结合渲染和几何异常语义；4) 跨层次对比对齐促进层间交互；5) 集成两层异常语义获得广义异常语义。

Result: 大量实验证明PointAD+在零样本3D异常检测方面具有优越性，能够对具有高度多样化类别语义的未见对象实现全面的异常理解。

Conclusion: PointAD+通过统一隐式和显式3D异常表示，成功将CLIP的2D能力迁移到3D领域，实现了对未见对象的全面异常检测，测试时可通过即插即用方式整合RGB信息进一步提升性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to transfer CLIP's robust 2D generalization
capabilities to identify 3D anomalies across unseen objects of highly diverse
class semantics. To this end, we propose a unified framework to comprehensively
detect and segment 3D anomalies by leveraging both point- and pixel-level
information. We first design PointAD, which leverages point-pixel
correspondence to represent 3D anomalies through their associated rendering
pixel representations. This approach is referred to as implicit 3D
representation, as it focuses solely on rendering pixel anomalies but neglects
the inherent spatial relationships within point clouds. Then, we propose
PointAD+ to further broaden the interpretation of 3D anomalies by introducing
explicit 3D representation, emphasizing spatial abnormality to uncover abnormal
spatial relationships. Hence, we propose G-aggregation to involve geometry
information to enable the aggregated point representations spatially aware. To
simultaneously capture rendering and spatial abnormality, PointAD+ proposes
hierarchical representation learning, incorporating implicit and explicit
anomaly semantics into hierarchical text prompts: rendering prompts for the
rendering layer and geometry prompts for the geometry layer. A cross-hierarchy
contrastive alignment is further introduced to promote the interaction between
the rendering and geometry layers, facilitating mutual anomaly learning.
Finally, PointAD+ integrates anomaly semantics from both layers to capture the
generalized anomaly semantics. During the test, PointAD+ can integrate RGB
information in a plug-and-play manner and further improve its detection
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of PointAD+ in
ZS 3D anomaly detection across unseen objects with highly diverse class
semantics, achieving a holistic understanding of abnormality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索验证奖励强化学习在少于70亿参数的轻量级多模态语言模型中的有效性，以及长思维链数据对提升此类模型推理能力的作用

Method: 使用长思维链数据进行监督微调(SFT)，随后进行强化学习(RL)阶段

Result: 长思维链数据的SFT显著提升MLLM推理能力，后续RL阶段可带来额外性能增益

Conclusion: 长思维链数据的SFT阶段是开发轻量级MLLM推理能力的关键前提条件

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards has enhanced the
reasoning of large-scale language models (LLMs), its efficacy for lightweight
multimodal language models (MLLMs) with fewer than seven billion parameters
remains underexplored. This paper investigates the role of long
Chain-of-Thought (long CoT) data in enhancing the reasoning abilities of such
MLLMs. Our findings demonstrate that Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with long CoT
data significantly improves MLLM reasoning. Furthermore, we observe that after
this initial SFT phase, MLLMs can achieve additional performance gains through
a subsequent RL stage. We conclude that a SFT stage with long CoT data is a
critical prerequisite for developing the reasoning capabilities of lightweight
MLLMs.

Conclusion: 混合CNN-Transformer架构在星形胶质细胞检测方面具有强大潜力，为先进计算病理学工具奠定了基础

Abstract: Astrocytes are critical glial cells whose altered morphology and density are
hallmarks of many neurological disorders. However, their intricate branching
and stain dependent variability make automated detection of histological images
a highly challenging task. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid CNN
Transformer detector that combines local feature extraction with global
contextual reasoning. A heatmap guided query mechanism generates spatially
grounded anchors for small and faint astrocytes, while a lightweight
Transformer module improves discrimination in dense clusters. Evaluated on
ALDH1L1 and GFAP stained astrocyte datasets, the model consistently
outperformed Faster R-CNN, YOLOv11 and DETR, achieving higher sensitivity with
fewer false positives, as confirmed by FROC analysis. These results highlight
the potential of hybrid CNN Transformer architectures for robust astrocyte
detection and provide a foundation for advanced computational pathology tools.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfraDiffusion是一个零样本框架，通过虚拟相机将砖石点云转换为深度图，并使用DDNM进行恢复，显著改善了砖级分割效果，特别适用于低光照环境下的基础设施检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要从RGB图像进行砖级缺陷检测，但在低光照环境（如砖石隧道）中获取高分辨率图像不切实际。点云虽然对昏暗光照鲁棒，但通常是非结构化、稀疏且有噪声的，限制了细粒度分割。

Method: 提出InfraDiffusion框架：1）使用虚拟相机将砖石点云投影为深度图；2）采用去噪扩散零空间模型（DDNM）进行恢复；3）无需任务特定训练即可增强深度图的视觉清晰度和几何一致性；4）使用Segment Anything Model（SAM）进行砖级分割。

Result: 在砖石桥梁和隧道点云数据集上的实验表明，该方法在砖级分割方面取得了显著改进，验证了其在砖石资产自动化检测中的潜力。

Conclusion: InfraDiffusion为零样本点云增强提供了有效解决方案，特别适用于低光照环境下的基础设施监测，为自动化砖石缺陷检测开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Point clouds are widely used for infrastructure monitoring by providing
geometric information, where segmentation is required for downstream tasks such
as defect detection. Existing research has automated semantic segmentation of
structural components, while brick-level segmentation (identifying defects such
as spalling and mortar loss) has been primarily conducted from RGB images.
However, acquiring high-resolution images is impractical in low-light
environments like masonry tunnels. Point clouds, though robust to dim lighting,
are typically unstructured, sparse, and noisy, limiting fine-grained
segmentation. We present InfraDiffusion, a zero-shot framework that projects
masonry point clouds into depth maps using virtual cameras and restores them by
adapting the Denoising Diffusion Null-space Model (DDNM). Without task-specific
training, InfraDiffusion enhances visual clarity and geometric consistency of
depth maps. Experiments on masonry bridge and tunnel point cloud datasets show
significant improvements in brick-level segmentation using the Segment Anything
Model (SAM), underscoring its potential for automated inspection of masonry
assets. Our code and data is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法难以同时表征全局依赖性和局部一致性，导致难以保持长程交互和边界细节。

Method: 使用transformer捕获全局依赖，引入内容自适应图神经网络增强局部关系，集成多传播阶数动态学习图结构，利用图残差机制保持全局信息并稳定训练。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: T-CAGU框架成功解决了高光谱解混中全局与局部特征平衡的问题，提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral unmixing (HU) targets to decompose each mixed pixel in remote
sensing images into a set of endmembers and their corresponding abundances.
Despite significant progress in this field using deep learning, most methods
fail to simultaneously characterize global dependencies and local consistency,
making it difficult to preserve both long-range interactions and boundary
details. This letter proposes a novel transformer-guided content-adaptive graph
unmixing framework (T-CAGU), which overcomes these challenges by employing a
transformer to capture global dependencies and introducing a content-adaptive
graph neural network to enhance local relationships. Unlike previous work,
T-CAGU integrates multiple propagation orders to dynamically learn the graph
structure, ensuring robustness against noise. Furthermore, T-CAGU leverages a
graph residual mechanism to preserve global information and stabilize training.
Experimental results demonstrate its superiority over the state-of-the-art
methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/T-CAGU.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers在图像分类中表现优异但计算成本高昂，需要在不损失精度的前提下降低推理成本。

Method: 通过轻量级视觉模型估计token重要性，在大型ViT进行注意力计算前选择性丢弃低重要性token，无需修改架构且兼容多种ViT。

Result: 在标准图像分类基准测试中，FLOPs减少高达80%，精度下降极小。

Conclusion: 该框架具有出色的泛化能力和实际应用价值，为高效ViT分类提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieve strong performance in image classification
but incur high computational costs from processing all image tokens. To reduce
inference costs in large ViTs without compromising accuracy, we propose
TinyDrop, a training-free token dropping framework guided by a lightweight
vision model. The guidance model estimates the importance of tokens while
performing inference, thereby selectively discarding low-importance tokens if
large vit models need to perform attention calculations. The framework operates
plug-and-play, requires no architectural modifications, and is compatible with
diverse ViT architectures. Evaluations on standard image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that our framework reduces FLOPs by up to 80% for ViTs
with minimal accuracy degradation, highlighting its generalization capability
and practical utility for efficient ViT-based classification.

Motivation: 现有评估指标在概念定制任务中要么过于狭隘要么过于泛化，与人类偏好存在偏差，特别是多概念评估更加困难

Method: 提出分解式GPT评分(D-GPTScore)，将评估标准分解为更细粒度的方面，并使用多模态大语言模型进行分方面评估

Result: 在CC-AlignBench基准上显著优于现有方法，与人类偏好表现出更高的相关性

Conclusion: 为概念定制评估建立了新标准，并指出了未来研究的关键挑战

Abstract: Evaluating concept customization is challenging, as it requires a
comprehensive assessment of fidelity to generative prompts and concept images.
Moreover, evaluating multiple concepts is considerably more difficult than
evaluating a single concept, as it demands detailed assessment not only for
each individual concept but also for the interactions among concepts. While
humans can intuitively assess generated images, existing metrics often provide
either overly narrow or overly generalized evaluations, resulting in
misalignment with human preference. To address this, we propose Decomposed GPT
Score (D-GPTScore), a novel human-aligned evaluation method that decomposes
evaluation criteria into finer aspects and incorporates aspect-wise assessments
using Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Additionally, we release Human
Preference-Aligned Concept Customization Benchmark (CC-AlignBench), a benchmark
dataset containing both single- and multi-concept tasks, enabling stage-wise
evaluation across a wide difficulty range -- from individual actions to
multi-person interactions. Our method significantly outperforms existing
approaches on this benchmark, exhibiting higher correlation with human
preferences. This work establishes a new standard for evaluating concept
customization and highlights key challenges for future research. The benchmark

Motivation: 医疗应用本质上是多模态的，但临床环境中可用的模态在不同地点和患者之间存在差异。乳腺癌分子分型作为重要临床任务，通过多模态整合可以实现个性化治疗和改善患者预后。

Method: 提出可扩展的松散耦合多模态框架，引入双重视野表示（结合传统图像和基于图的表示）用于全视野数字切片图像，并开发新的多模态融合策略。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅适用于乳腺癌，还能轻松适应其他模态，具有灵活扩展性，无需重新训练现有模态，可应用于其他类型癌症的多模态分析。

Abstract: Healthcare applications are inherently multimodal, benefiting greatly from
the integration of diverse data sources. However, the modalities available in
clinical settings can vary across different locations and patients. A key area
that stands to gain from multimodal integration is breast cancer molecular
subtyping, an important clinical task that can facilitate personalized
treatment and improve patient prognosis. In this work, we propose a scalable
and loosely-coupled multimodal framework that seamlessly integrates data from
various modalities, including copy number variation (CNV), clinical records,
and histopathology images, to enhance breast cancer subtyping. While our
primary focus is on breast cancer, our framework is designed to easily
accommodate additional modalities, offering the flexibility to scale up or down
with minimal overhead without requiring re-training of existing modalities,
making it applicable to other types of cancers as well. We introduce a
dual-based representation for whole slide images (WSIs), combining traditional
image-based and graph-based WSI representations. This novel dual approach
results in significant performance improvements. Moreover, we present a new
multimodal fusion strategy, demonstrating its ability to enhance performance
across a range of multimodal conditions. Our comprehensive results show that
integrating our dual-based WSI representation with CNV and clinical health
records, along with our pipeline and fusion strategy, outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in breast cancer subtyping.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理密集视频描述任务中的长视频时，遇到计算复杂性和内存限制问题，且需要整个视频作为输入，无法支持在线处理。

Method: 提出带有转移状态的状态空间模型(SSMs)，结合SSMs的长序列和递归特性，解决SSMs在很长上下文中无法维持状态的主要限制。

Result: 方法在密集视频描述任务中表现良好，能够随视频长度良好扩展，使用计算量减少7倍，支持在线流式生成描述。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了长视频处理的挑战，实现了高效的在线密集视频描述，具有重要的实践价值。

Abstract: Dense video captioning is a challenging video understanding task which aims
to simultaneously segment the video into a sequence of meaningful consecutive
events and to generate detailed captions to accurately describe each event.
Existing methods often encounter difficulties when working with the long videos
associated with dense video captioning, due to the computational complexity and
memory limitations. Furthermore, traditional approaches require the entire
video as input, in order to produce an answer, which precludes online
processing of the video. We address these challenges by time-scaling
State-Space Models (SSMs) to even longer sequences than before. Our approach,
State-Space Models with Transfer State, combines both the long-sequence and
recurrent properties of SSMs and addresses the main limitation of SSMs which
are otherwise not able to sustain their state for very long contexts,
effectively scaling SSMs further in time. The proposed model is particularly
suitable for generating captions on-the-fly, in an online or streaming manner,
without having to wait for the full video to be processed, which is more
beneficial in practice. When applied to dense video captioning, our approach
scales well with video lengths and uses 7x fewer FLOPs.

Conclusion: 该框架通过多模态融合和动态平衡策略，有效提升了从EEG信号解码视觉神经表征的性能，证明了文本模态在增强语义对应关系方面的重要作用。

Abstract: In this work, we propose an innovative framework that integrates EEG, image,
and text data, aiming to decode visual neural representations from low
signal-to-noise ratio EEG signals. Specifically, we introduce text modality to
enhance the semantic correspondence between EEG signals and visual content.
With the explicit semantic labels provided by text, image and EEG features of
the same category can be more closely aligned with the corresponding text
representations in a shared multimodal space. To fully utilize pre-trained
visual and textual representations, we propose an adapter module that
alleviates the instability of high-dimensional representation while
facilitating the alignment and fusion of cross-modal features. Additionally, to
alleviate the imbalance in multimodal feature contributions introduced by the
textual representations, we propose a Modal Consistency Dynamic Balance (MCDB)
strategy that dynamically adjusts the contribution weights of each modality. We
further propose a stochastic perturbation regularization (SPR) term to enhance
the generalization ability of semantic perturbation-based models by introducing
dynamic Gaussian noise in the modality optimization process. The evaluation
results on the ThingsEEG dataset show that our method surpasses previous
state-of-the-art methods in both Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy metrics, improving by
2.0\% and 4.7\% respectively.

Conclusion: JTGD通过联合训练生成器和检测器，生成更高质量的困难样本用于数据增强，在保持高性能的同时大幅减少计算资源需求，非常适合实际边缘设备部署。

Abstract: Road defect detection is important for road authorities to reduce the vehicle
damage caused by road defects. Considering the practical scenarios where the
defect detectors are typically deployed on edge devices with limited memory and
computational resource, we aim at performing road defect detection without
using ensemble-based methods or test-time augmentation (TTA). To this end, we
propose to Jointly Train the image Generator and Detector for road defect
detection (dubbed as JTGD). We design the dual discriminators for the
generative model to enforce both the synthesized defect patches and overall
images to look plausible. The synthesized image quality is improved by our
proposed CLIP-based Fr\'echet Inception Distance loss. The generative model in
JTGD is trained jointly with the detector to encourage the generative model to
synthesize harder examples for the detector. Since harder synthesized images of
better quality caused by the aforesaid design are used in the data
augmentation, JTGD outperforms the state-of-the-art method in the RDD2022 road
defect detection benchmark across various countries under the condition of no
ensemble and TTA. JTGD only uses less than 20% of the number of parameters
compared with the competing baseline, which makes it more suitable for
deployment on edge devices in practice.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel parameter-efficient adaptation method for
No- Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) using visual prompts optimized
in pixel-space. Unlike full fine-tuning of Multimodal Large Language Models

model), while keeping the underlying model fully frozen. During inference,
these visual prompts are combined with images via addition and processed by
mPLUG-Owl2 with the textual query "Rate the technical quality of the image."
Evaluations across distortion types (synthetic, realistic, AI-generated) on
KADID- 10k, KonIQ-10k, and AGIQA-3k demonstrate competitive performance against
full finetuned methods and specialized NR-IQA models, achieving 0.93 SRCC on

Abstract: We introduce OneCAT, a unified multimodal model that seamlessly integrates
understanding, generation, and editing within a novel, pure decoder-only
transformer architecture. Our framework uniquely eliminates the need for
external components such as Vision Transformers (ViT) or vision tokenizer
during inference, leading to significant efficiency gains, especially for
high-resolution inputs. This is achieved through a modality-specific
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure trained with a single autoregressive (AR)
objective, which also natively supports dynamic resolutions. Furthermore, we
pioneer a multi-scale visual autoregressive mechanism within the Large Language
Model (LLM) that drastically reduces decoding steps compared to diffusion-based
methods while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. Our findings
demonstrate the powerful potential of pure autoregressive modeling as a
sufficient and elegant foundation for unified multimodal intelligence. As a
result, OneCAT sets a new performance standard, outperforming existing
open-source unified multimodal models across benchmarks for multimodal
generation, editing, and understanding.

Motivation: 为了解决深海视频多目标跟踪缺乏标准化测试集的问题，提供可重现的性能评估方法。

Method: 开发了包含4个深海视频序列的新测试集，使用Higher Order Tracking Accuracy指标评估多个检测模型和跟踪器的性能。

Result: 成功构建了公开的测试集，提供了明确的工作流程和计算指标的Python示例。

Conclusion: 该研究为深海视频多目标跟踪领域提供了重要的基准资源，有助于模型性能的可靠评估和比较。

Abstract: Benchmarking multi-object tracking and object detection model performance is
an essential step in machine learning model development, as it allows
researchers to evaluate model detection and tracker performance on
human-generated 'test' data, facilitating consistent comparisons between models
and trackers and aiding performance optimization. In this study, a novel
benchmark video dataset was developed and used to assess the performance of
several Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute object detection models and a
FathomNet single-class object detection model together with several trackers.
The dataset consists of four video sequences representing midwater and benthic
deep-sea habitats. Performance was evaluated using Higher Order Tracking
Accuracy, a metric that balances detection, localization, and association
accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available
benchmark for multi-object tracking in deep-sea video footage. We provide the
benchmark data, a clearly documented workflow for generating additional
benchmark videos, as well as example Python notebooks for computing metrics.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个用于研究遗传对笔迹影响的大型数据库，包含210个家庭成员的笔迹样本，可用于分析笔迹的遗传性和家族关系影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏研究笔迹遗传性的专用数据库，需要建立一个包含多代家庭成员笔迹样本的数据库来探索笔迹是否具有遗传成分以及家族关系如何影响笔迹风格。

Method: 收集210个家庭（包括祖父母、父母、叔伯姑姨、兄弟姐妹、堂表兄弟姐妹、侄子侄女等）的手写样本，包括数字、字母、形状和自由段落，使用专门设计的表格记录所有书写者的家族关系。

Result: 通过比较家庭成员笔迹特征，发现了他们之间在书写风格和特征上的相似性，建立了首个此类数据库并向模式识别社区免费提供。

Conclusion: 该数据库为研究遗传和家族关系对笔迹的影响开辟了新途径，填补了该领域数据资源的空白。

Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive database for research and investigation
on the effects of inheritance on handwriting. A database has been created that
can be used to answer questions such as: Is there a genetic component to
handwriting? Is handwriting inherited? Do family relationships affect
handwriting? Varieties of samples of handwritten components such as: digits,
letters, shapes and free paragraphs of 210 families including (grandparents,
parents, uncles, aunts, siblings, cousins, nephews and nieces) have been
collected using specially designed forms, and family relationships of all
writers are captured. To the best of our knowledge, no such database is
presently available. Based on comparisons and investigation of features of
handwritings of family members, similarities among their features and writing
styles are detected. Our database is freely available to the pattern
recognition community and hope it will pave the way for investigations on the
effects of inheritance and family relationships on handwritings.

TL;DR: T2I-CoReBench是一个全面的文本到图像生成基准测试，通过12维评估分类法评估模型的组合和推理能力，包含1080个复杂提示和13500个检查问题，揭示了当前模型在复杂场景中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成基准测试在评估组合和推理能力方面存在明显局限，无法全面评估模型在这两个核心能力上的表现，特别是在复杂场景和高密度推理方面。

Method: 构建了一个包含1080个挑战性提示的基准测试，围绕场景图元素（实例、属性和关系）构建组合能力评估，围绕哲学推理框架（演绎、归纳和溯因）构建推理能力评估，形成12维评估分类法。

Result: 对27个当前T2I模型的实验显示，模型在复杂高密度场景中的组合能力仍然有限，推理能力更是明显落后，所有模型都难以从提示中推断隐含元素。

Conclusion: T2I-CoReBench提供了一个全面复杂的评估框架，揭示了当前文本到图像生成模型在组合和推理能力方面的关键瓶颈，为未来模型发展提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation aims to synthesize images from textual
prompts, which jointly specify what must be shown and imply what can be
inferred, thereby corresponding to two core capabilities: composition and
reasoning. However, with the emerging advances of T2I models in reasoning
beyond composition, existing benchmarks reveal clear limitations in providing
comprehensive evaluations across and within these capabilities. Meanwhile,
these advances also enable models to handle more complex prompts, whereas
current benchmarks remain limited to low scene density and simplified
one-to-one reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose T2I-CoReBench, a
comprehensive and complex benchmark that evaluates both composition and
reasoning capabilities of T2I models. To ensure comprehensiveness, we structure
composition around scene graph elements (instance, attribute, and relation) and
reasoning around the philosophical framework of inference (deductive,
inductive, and abductive), formulating a 12-dimensional evaluation taxonomy. To
increase complexity, driven by the inherent complexities of real-world
scenarios, we curate each prompt with high compositional density for
composition and multi-step inference for reasoning. We also pair each prompt
with a checklist that specifies individual yes/no questions to assess each
intended element independently to facilitate fine-grained and reliable
evaluation. In statistics, our benchmark comprises 1,080 challenging prompts
and around 13,500 checklist questions. Experiments across 27 current T2I models
reveal that their composition capability still remains limited in complex
high-density scenarios, while the reasoning capability lags even further behind
as a critical bottleneck, with all models struggling to infer implicit elements
from prompts. Our project page: https://t2i-corebench.github.io/.

Motivation: 探索媒体报道是否能够作为一种软规制方式，通过影响AI创造者的品牌声誉来促使他们采取安全措施，以实现更广泛的AI技术采用。

Method: 使用进化游戏理论构建人工人群模型，包含自利的创造者和用户，分析媒体报道对他们行为的影响。

Result: 媒体确实能够促进创造者与用户之间的合作，但需要满足一定条件：媒体信息的可靠性、访问媒体的成本以及确保安全的成本都不能过高。

Conclusion: 媒体可以作为一种强大的软规制方式，通过形成公众意见和让开发者承担责任来引导AI安全发展，甚至在没有政府正式监管的情况下也能发挥作用。

Abstract: When developers of artificial intelligence (AI) products need to decide
between profit and safety for the users, they likely choose profit.
Untrustworthy AI technology must come packaged with tangible negative
consequences. Here, we envisage those consequences as the loss of reputation
caused by media coverage of their misdeeds, disseminated to the public. We
explore whether media coverage has the potential to push AI creators into the
production of safe products, enabling widespread adoption of AI technology. We
created artificial populations of self-interested creators and users and
studied them through the lens of evolutionary game theory. Our results reveal
that media is indeed able to foster cooperation between creators and users, but
not always. Cooperation does not evolve if the quality of the information
provided by the media is not reliable enough, or if the costs of either
accessing media or ensuring safety are too high. By shaping public perception
and holding developers accountable, media emerges as a powerful soft regulator
-- guiding AI safety even in the absence of formal government oversight.

which was held in March 2025 with the goal of understanding how the MPS domains
(Astronomy, Chemistry, Materials Research, Mathematical Sciences, and Physics)
can best capitalize on, and contribute to, the future of AI. We present here a
summary and snapshot of the MPS community's perspective, as of Spring/Summer
2025, in a rapidly developing field. The link between AI and MPS is becoming
increasingly inextricable; now is a crucial moment to strengthen the link
between AI and Science by pursuing a strategy that proactively and thoughtfully
leverages the potential of AI for scientific discovery and optimizes
opportunities to impact the development of AI by applying concepts from
fundamental science. To achieve this, we propose activities and strategic
priorities that: (1) enable AI+MPS research in both directions; (2) build up an
interdisciplinary community of AI+MPS researchers; and (3) foster education and
workforce development in AI for MPS researchers and students. We conclude with
a summary of suggested priorities for funding agencies, educational
institutions, and individual researchers to help position the MPS community to
be a leader in, and take full advantage of, the transformative potential of

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合语义算子优化执行和深度研究系统灵活性的AI驱动分析运行时原型，通过让深度研究代理编写和执行优化的语义算子程序，在性能和成本上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI驱动分析存在两个主要问题：语义算子在大规模数据上执行成本高且不适合交互式分析；深度研究系统缺乏查询计划优化导致执行效率低下。需要结合两者的优势来提升AI分析性能。

Method: 构建了一个原型系统，使深度研究代理能够编写和执行优化的语义算子程序，将语义算子的优化执行能力与深度研究系统的动态执行灵活性相结合。

Result: 原型系统在基础查询上优于手工制作的语义算子程序和开放深度研究系统，相比标准深度研究代理F1分数提升达1.95倍，即使代理可以使用语义算子作为工具，仍能实现高达76.8%的成本节省和72.7%的运行时间节省。

Conclusion: 该研究为AI驱动分析提供了一个有前景的方向，通过结合语义算子的优化执行和深度研究系统的灵活性，能够显著提升分析性能和效率，是迈向更高效AI分析运行时的重要一步。

Abstract: With advances in large language models (LLMs), researchers are creating new
systems that can perform AI-driven analytics over large unstructured datasets.
Recent work has explored executing such analytics queries using semantic
operators -- a declarative set of AI-powered data transformations with natural
language specifications. However, even when optimized, these operators can be
expensive to execute on millions of records and their iterator execution
semantics make them ill-suited for interactive data analytics tasks. In another
line of work, Deep Research systems have demonstrated an ability to answer
natural language question(s) over large datasets. These systems use one or more
LLM agent(s) to plan their execution, process the dataset(s), and iteratively
refine their answer. However, these systems do not explicitly optimize their
query plans which can lead to poor plan execution. In order for AI-driven
analytics to excel, we need a runtime which combines the optimized execution of
semantic operators with the flexibility and more dynamic execution of Deep
Research systems. As a first step towards this vision, we build a prototype
which enables Deep Research agents to write and execute optimized semantic
operator programs. We evaluate our prototype and demonstrate that it can
outperform a handcrafted semantic operator program and open Deep Research
systems on two basic queries. Compared to a standard open Deep Research agent,
our prototype achieves up to 1.95x better F1-score. Furthermore, even if we
give the agent access to semantic operators as tools, our prototype still
achieves cost and runtime savings of up to 76.8% and 72.7% thanks to its
optimized execution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前高层次世界模型在理解和推理具有语义和时间抽象的动作方面发展不足，需要能够进行语言基础世界建模的模型。

Method: 使用Vision Language World Model (VLWM)，通过LLM自优化提取目标，学习动作策略和动态模型，结合系统1反应式解码和系统2基于成本最小化的反思式规划。

Result: 在Visual Planning for Assistance (VPA)基准测试和PlannerArena人类评估中达到最先进性能，系统2比系统1Elo分数提升27%，在RoboVQA和WorldPrediction基准上也优于强VLM基线。

Conclusion: VLWM通过语言基础的世界建模和双系统规划方法，有效提升了语义动作推理和视觉规划能力，为高层次世界模型发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: Effective planning requires strong world models, but high-level world models
that can understand and reason about actions with semantic and temporal
abstraction remain largely underdeveloped. We introduce the Vision Language
World Model (VLWM), a foundation model trained for language-based world
modeling on natural videos. Given visual observations, the VLWM first infers
the overall goal achievements then predicts a trajectory composed of
interleaved actions and world state changes. Those targets are extracted by
iterative LLM Self-Refine conditioned on compressed future observations
represented by Tree of Captions. The VLWM learns both an action policy and a
dynamics model, which respectively facilitates reactive system-1 plan decoding
and reflective system-2 planning via cost minimization. The cost evaluates the
semantic distance between the hypothetical future states given by VLWM
roll-outs and the expected goal state, and is measured by a critic model that
we trained in a self-supervised manner. The VLWM achieves state-of-the-art
Visual Planning for Assistance (VPA) performance on both benchmark evaluations
and our proposed PlannerArena human evaluations, where system-2 improves the
Elo score by +27% upon system-1. The VLWM models also outperforms strong VLM
baselines on RoboVQA and WorldPrediction benchmark.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have not only advanced
natural language processing but also inspired their application in domains with
structurally similar problems--most notably, autonomous driving motion
generation. Both domains involve autoregressive sequence modeling, token-based
representations, and context-aware decision making, making the transfer of LLM
components a natural and increasingly common practice. However, despite
promising early attempts, a systematic understanding of which LLM modules are
truly transferable remains lacking. In this paper, we present a comprehensive
evaluation of five key LLM modules--tokenizer design, positional embedding,
pre-training paradigms, post-training strategies, and test-time
computation--within the context of motion generation for autonomous driving.
Through extensive experiments on the Waymo Sim Agents benchmark, we demonstrate
that, when appropriately adapted, these modules can significantly improve
performance for autonomous driving motion generation. In addition, we identify
which techniques can be effectively transferred, analyze the potential reasons
for the failure of others, and discuss the specific adaptations needed for
autonomous driving scenarios. We evaluate our method on the Sim Agents task and
achieve competitive results.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based task plans and corresponding human
demonstrations for embodied AI may be noisy, with unnecessary actions,
redundant navigation, and logical errors that reduce policy quality. We propose
an iterative verification framework in which a Judge LLM critiques action
sequences and a Planner LLM applies the revisions, yielding progressively
cleaner and more spatially coherent trajectories. Unlike rule-based approaches,
our method relies on natural language prompting, enabling broad generalization
across error types including irrelevant actions, contradictions, and missing
steps. On a set of manually annotated actions from the TEACh embodied AI
dataset, our framework achieves up to 90% recall and 100% precision across four
state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT o4-mini, DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.5, LLaMA 4 Scout).
The refinement loop converges quickly, with 96.5% of sequences requiring at
most three iterations, while improving both temporal efficiency and spatial
action organization. Crucially, the method preserves human error-recovery
patterns rather than collapsing them, supporting future work on robust
corrective behavior. By establishing plan verification as a reliable LLM
capability for spatial planning and action refinement, we provide a scalable
path to higher-quality training data for imitation learning in embodied AI.

Motivation: 现有的选择超级假方主要关注于从预定义集合中适应性选择低级假方，而该研究重点关注于这个集合的组成和战略性转换，以提升超级假方的性能。

Method: 系统分析了基于三个关键原则的转换：解决方案接受、低级假方重复和扰动强度（即扰动性假方影响解决方案的比例）。将这些转换应用于平凡的无偏随机选择机制进行测试。

Result: 通过适当构建的转换，平凡的随机选择机制在三个具有挑战性的实际领域上超越了所有现有的最先进超级假方，发现了11个新的最佳知解。该方法在CHeSC竞赛中与冠军方法竞争力相当，并在现有超级假方中应用这种转换后，在CHeSC基准和实际领域上都超越了当前最先进方法。

Conclusion: 通过重点关注低级假方集合的战略性转换，而非仅仅是假方选择，可以显著提升超级假方的性能，甚至能让简单的方法达到优异效果，同时简化了设计。

Abstract: Cross-domain selection hyper-heuristics aim to distill decades of research on
problem-specific heuristic search algorithms into adaptable general-purpose
search strategies. In this respect, existing selection hyper-heuristics
primarily focus on an adaptive selection of low-level heuristics (LLHs) from a
predefined set. In contrast, we concentrate on the composition of this set and
its strategic transformations. We systematically analyze transformations based
on three key principles: solution acceptance, LLH repetitions, and perturbation
intensity, i.e., the proportion of a solution affected by a perturbative LLH.
We demonstrate the raw effects of our transformations on a trivial unbiased
random selection mechanism. With an appropriately constructed transformation,
this trivial method outperforms all available state-of-the-art hyper-heuristics
on three challenging real-world domains and finds 11 new best-known solutions.
The same method is competitive with the winner of the CHeSC competition,
commonly used as the standard cross-domain benchmark. Moreover, we accompany
several recent hyper-heuristics with such strategic transformations. Using this
approach, we outperform the current state-of-the-art methods on both the CHeSC
benchmark and real-world domains while often simplifying their designs.

Abstract: Combinatorial methods for learning general policies that solve large
collections of planning problems have been recently developed. One of their
strengths, in relation to deep learning approaches, is that the resulting
policies can be understood and shown to be correct. A weakness is that the
methods do not scale up and learn only from small training instances and
feature pools that contain a few hundreds of states and features at most. In
this work, we propose a new symbolic method for learning policies based on the
generalization of sampled plans that ensures structural termination and hence
acyclicity. The proposed learning approach is not based on SAT/ASP, as previous
symbolic methods, but on a hitting set algorithm that can effectively handle
problems with millions of states, and pools with hundreds of thousands of
features. The formal properties of the approach are analyzed, and its
scalability is tested on a number of benchmarks.

Abstract: Adaptive exploration methods propose ways to learn complex policies via
alternating between exploration and exploitation. An important question for
such methods is to determine the appropriate moment to switch between
exploration and exploitation and vice versa. This is critical in domains that
require the learning of long and complex sequences of actions. In this work, we
present a generic adaptive exploration framework that employs uncertainty to
address this important issue in a principled manner. Our framework includes
previous adaptive exploration approaches as special cases. Moreover, we can
incorporate in our framework any uncertainty-measuring mechanism of choice, for
instance mechanisms used in intrinsic motivation or epistemic uncertainty-based
exploration methods. We experimentally demonstrate that our framework gives
rise to adaptive exploration strategies that outperform standard ones across
several MuJoCo environments.

Abstract: AI is transforming the healthcare domain and is increasingly helping
practitioners to make health-related decisions. Therefore, accountability
becomes a crucial concern for critical AI-driven decisions. Although regulatory
bodies, such as the EU commission, provide guidelines, they are highlevel and
focus on the ''what'' that should be done and less on the ''how'', creating a
knowledge gap for actors. Through an extensive analysis, we found that the term
accountability is perceived and dealt with in many different ways, depending on
the actor's expertise and domain of work. With increasing concerns about AI
accountability issues and the ambiguity around this term, this paper bridges
the gap between the ''what'' and ''how'' of AI accountability, specifically for
AI systems in healthcare. We do this by analysing the concept of
accountability, formulating an accountability framework, and providing a
three-tier structure for handling various accountability mechanisms. Our
accountability framework positions the regulations of healthcare AI systems and
the mechanisms adopted by the actors under a consistent accountability regime.
Moreover, the three-tier structure guides the actors of the healthcare AI
system to categorise the mechanisms based on their conduct. Through our
framework, we advocate that decision-making in healthcare AI holds shared
dependencies, where accountability should be dealt with jointly and should
foster collaborations. We highlight the role of explainability in instigating
communication and information sharing between the actors to further facilitate
the collaborative process.

TL;DR: app.build是一个开源框架，通过系统化验证和结构化环境改进基于LLM的应用生成，实现了73.3%的可行性率和30%的完美质量评分，开源模型在结构化环境中能达到闭源模型80.8%的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高LLM应用生成的可靠性和质量，通过系统化验证和结构化环境来解决当前AI代理系统在生成应用时面临的质量和可靠性问题。

Method: 结合多层验证管道、特定技术栈编排和模型无关架构，在三个参考技术栈上实现，包括系统化验证流程和结构化环境设计。

Result: 在30个生成任务评估中，综合验证实现了73.3%的可行性率，30%达到完美质量评分；开源模型在结构化环境中达到闭源模型80.8%的性能；开源框架已被社区采用，生成了3000多个应用。

Conclusion: 扩展可靠AI代理需要扩展环境而不仅仅是模型，这项工作为生产导向的代理系统提供了实证见解和完整的参考实现。

Abstract: We present app.build (https://github.com/appdotbuild/agent/), an open-source
framework that improves LLM-based application generation through systematic
validation and structured environments. Our approach combines multi-layered
validation pipelines, stack-specific orchestration, and model-agnostic
architecture, implemented across three reference stacks. Through evaluation on
30 generation tasks, we demonstrate that comprehensive validation achieves
73.3% viability rate with 30% reaching perfect quality scores, while
open-weights models achieve 80.8% of closed-model performance when provided
structured environments. The open-source framework has been adopted by the
community, with over 3,000 applications generated to date. This work
demonstrates that scaling reliable AI agents requires scaling environments, not
just models -- providing empirical insights and complete reference
implementations for production-oriented agent systems.

*Yunxin Sun,Abulhair Saparov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了InAbHyD数据集来评估大语言模型在归纳和溯因推理方面的能力，发现LLMs在简单场景中表现良好，但在复杂世界模型和高质量假设生成方面仍有困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数研究只关注演绎推理，而归纳和溯因推理在解决现实世界问题中同样重要但较少被探索，需要系统评估LLMs在这些推理类型上的能力。

Method: 创建了可编程的合成数据集InAbHyD，每个推理示例包含不完整的世界模型和观察结果，提出基于奥卡姆剃刀原理的新指标来评估假设质量，并测试了最先进的LLMs。

Result: LLMs在简单场景中能够进行归纳和溯因推理，但在复杂世界模型下表现不佳，即使使用上下文学习和RLVR等推理增强技术也难以产生高质量的假设。

Conclusion: 虽然LLMs在简单推理任务中展现了一定能力，但在复杂推理场景中仍存在显著局限性，需要进一步研究来提升其归纳和溯因推理能力。

Abstract: Reasoning is a core capability in artificial intelligence systems, for which
large language models (LLMs) have recently shown remarkable progress. However,
most work focuses exclusively on deductive reasoning, which is problematic
since other types of reasoning are also essential in solving real-world
problems, and they are less explored. This work focuses on evaluating LLMs'
inductive and abductive reasoning capabilities. We introduce a programmable and
synthetic dataset, InAbHyD (pronounced in-a-bid), where each reasoning example
consists of an incomplete world model and a set of observations. The task for
the intelligent agent is to produce hypotheses to explain observations under
the incomplete world model to solve each reasoning example. We propose a new
metric to evaluate the quality of hypotheses based on Occam's Razor. We
evaluate and analyze some state-of-the-art LLMs. Our analysis shows that LLMs
can perform inductive and abductive reasoning in simple scenarios, but struggle
with complex world models and producing high-quality hypotheses, even with
popular reasoning-enhancing techniques such as in-context learning and RLVR.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于环境变化触发的底层框架，通过异构环境感知（aspects）控制信息流动，实现了零信息泄漏的专业化AI代理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自主AI代理多为自动聊天机器人，由不可靠的指指控制，导致高达83%的信息泄漏问题。

Method: 提出基于环境变化触发行为的底层框架，引入aspects概念（类似umwelt）使不同代理以不同方式感知环境，实现信息流动的清晰控制。

Result: 与典型架构相比，该方法实现了零信息泄漏，而典型架构泄漏率可达83%。

Conclusion: 专业化代理在自身信息小生境中高效工作，能够同时提升安全性和效率。

Abstract: Agentic LLM AI agents are often little more than autonomous chatbots: actors
following scripts, often controlled by an unreliable director. This work
introduces a bottom-up framework that situates AI agents in their environment,
with all behaviors triggered by changes in their environments. It introduces
the notion of aspects, similar to the idea of umwelt, where sets of agents
perceive their environment differently to each other, enabling clearer control
of information. We provide an illustrative implementation and show that
compared to a typical architecture, which leaks up to 83% of the time,
aspective agentic AI enables zero information leakage. We anticipate that this
concept of specialist agents working efficiently in their own information
niches can provide improvements to both security and efficiency.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究具身AI系统的对抗性安全攻击，基于ISO标准提出安全违规分类法，创建ANNIEBench基准测试和ANNIE-Attack攻击框架，在真实机器人实验中验证攻击成功率超50%，揭示了具身AI系统的重要安全漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉-语言-动作模型在具身AI机器人中的集成，系统面临新的安全风险：受损的VLA模型可将对抗性扰动直接转化为不安全的物理动作。传统机器学习安全方法已不足够，需要研究在物理接地、交互环境中的安全定义、测量和防御机制。

Method: 1) 基于物理约束（分离距离、速度、碰撞边界）形式化安全违规分类法（关键、危险、风险）；2) 创建ANNIEBench基准，包含9个安全关键场景和2400个视频-动作序列；3) 开发ANNIE-Attack任务感知对抗框架，使用攻击引导模型将长时程目标分解为帧级扰动。

Result: 在代表性EAI模型上的评估显示，所有安全类别的攻击成功率均超过50%。展示了稀疏和自适应攻击策略，并通过物理机器人实验验证了真实世界影响。

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了具身AI系统中先前未被充分探索但极其重要的攻击面，强调了在物理AI时代对安全驱动防御的迫切需求。

Abstract: The integration of vision-language-action (VLA) models into embodied AI (EAI)
robots is rapidly advancing their ability to perform complex, long-horizon
tasks in humancentric environments. However, EAI systems introduce critical
security risks: a compromised VLA model can directly translate adversarial
perturbations on sensory input into unsafe physical actions. Traditional safety
definitions and methodologies from the machine learning community are no longer
sufficient. EAI systems raise new questions, such as what constitutes safety,
how to measure it, and how to design effective attack and defense mechanisms in
physically grounded, interactive settings. In this work, we present the first
systematic study of adversarial safety attacks on embodied AI systems, grounded
in ISO standards for human-robot interactions. We (1) formalize a principled
taxonomy of safety violations (critical, dangerous, risky) based on physical
constraints such as separation distance, velocity, and collision boundaries;
(2) introduce ANNIEBench, a benchmark of nine safety-critical scenarios with
2,400 video-action sequences for evaluating embodied safety; and (3)
ANNIE-Attack, a task-aware adversarial framework with an attack leader model
that decomposes long-horizon goals into frame-level perturbations. Our
evaluation across representative EAI models shows attack success rates
exceeding 50% across all safety categories. We further demonstrate sparse and
adaptive attack strategies and validate the real-world impact through physical
robot experiments. These results expose a previously underexplored but highly
consequential attack surface in embodied AI systems, highlighting the urgent
need for security-driven defenses in the physical AI era. Code is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAM-LLM是一种混合架构，将大语言模型的上下文推理能力与运动学车道变换模型的物理精度相结合，用于自动驾驶中的可解释车道变换轨迹预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统坐标预测方法缺乏物理可解释性和计算效率低的问题，通过参数化输出实现物理上合理的轨迹预测。

Method: 微调LLM输出轨迹模型的核心物理参数而非原始坐标，对于车道保持预测离散坐标，对于车道变换预测增强正弦加速度模型(SAM)的参数。

Result: 实现了98.73%的意图预测准确率，输出大小相比坐标方法减少80%，在保持性能的同时显著提升可解释性和资源效率。

Conclusion: SAM-LLM在自动驾驶轨迹预测中实现了性能与可解释性的平衡，为物理合理的轨迹生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This work introduces SAM-LLM, a novel hybrid architecture that bridges the
gap between the contextual reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the
physical precision of kinematic lane change models for autonomous driving. The
system is designed for interpretable lane change trajectory prediction by
finetuning an LLM to output the core physical parameters of a trajectory model
instead of raw coordinates. For lane-keeping scenarios, the model predicts
discrete coordinates, but for lane change maneuvers, it generates the
parameters for an enhanced Sinusoidal Acceleration Model (SAM), including
lateral displacement, maneuver duration, initial lateral velocity, and
longitudinal velocity change. This parametric approach yields a complete,
continuous, and physically plausible trajectory model that is inherently
interpretable and computationally efficient, achieving an 80% reduction in
output size compared to coordinate-based methods. The SAM-LLM achieves a
state-of-the-art overall intention prediction accuracy of 98.73%, demonstrating
performance equivalent to traditional LLM predictors while offering significant
advantages in explainability and resource efficiency.

TL;DR: 基于头显集成红外结构光投影技术，通过分析阴影来检测无仪器表面的触摸事件


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决混合现实系统在无仪器日常表面上检测触摸事件的问题，提供更好的性能和人体工程学体验

Method: 使用计算机触发的摄像头和一个或多个红外发射器创建结构化阴影，通过分析阴影来估计悬停距离和触摸接触

Result: 实现了高精度的悬停距离估计（平均误差6.9mm）和高准确率的触摸检测（98.0%准确率）

Conclusion: 该技术在各种条件下都能工作，包括不同表面材质、交互方向和环境光照，为混合现实系统提供了一种新的触摸检测方案

Abstract: The ability to detect touch events on uninstrumented, everyday surfaces has
been a long-standing goal for mixed reality systems. Prior work has shown that
virtual interfaces bound to physical surfaces offer performance and ergonomic
benefits over tapping at interfaces floating in the air. A wide variety of
approaches have been previously developed, to which we contribute a new
headset-integrated technique called \systemname. We use a combination of a
computer-triggered camera and one or more infrared emitters to create
structured shadows, from which we can accurately estimate hover distance (mean
error of 6.9~mm) and touch contact (98.0\% accuracy). We discuss how our
technique works across a range of conditions, including surface material,
interaction orientation, and environmental lighting.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: STRive是一个可视化分析系统，通过关联规则挖掘技术帮助用户发现和探索时空数据中的模式，结合交互机制分析提取的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可视化工具往往只关注属性关系或时空分析，很少同时支持两者。大多数数据集不直接显示属性关系，需要额外算法提取有意义的模式。

Method: 采用关联规则挖掘(ARM)技术处理时空数据集，结合三种关键步骤：规则生成、规则聚类和交互式可视化。提供两种分析模式：规则聚类级别和单个规则级别分析。

Result: 通过两个真实世界数据集（致命车辆事故和城市犯罪）的案例研究，证明了系统在复杂时空背景下支持可解释模式发现和分析的能力。

Conclusion: STRive系统成功地将关联规则挖掘与交互式可视化相结合，为用户提供了发现和理解时空数据中模式的有效工具，在复杂时空数据分析方面表现出色。

Abstract: Effectively analyzing spatiotemporal data plays a central role in
understanding real-world phenomena and informing decision-making. Capturing the
interaction between spatial and temporal dimensions also helps explain the
underlying structure of the data. However, most datasets do not reveal
attribute relationships, requiring additional algorithms to extract meaningful
patterns. Existing visualization tools often focus either on attribute
relationships or spatiotemporal analysis, but rarely support both
simultaneously. In this paper, we present STRive (SpatioTemporal Rule
Interactive Visual Explorer), a visual analytics system that enables users to
uncover and explore spatial and temporal patterns in data. At the core of
STRive lies Association Rule Mining (ARM), which we apply to spatiotemporal
datasets to generate interpretable and actionable insights. We combine ARM with
multiple interactive mechanisms to analyze the extracted relationships.
Association rules serve as interpretable guidance mechanisms for visual
analytics by highlighting the meaningful aspects of the data that users should
investigate. Our methodology includes three key steps: rule generation, rule
clustering, and interactive visualization. STRive offers two modes of analysis.
The first operates at the rule cluster level and includes four coordinated
views, each showing a different facet of a cluster, including its temporal and
spatial behavior. The second mode mirrors the first but focuses on individual
rules within a selected cluster. We evaluate the effectiveness of STRive
through two case studies involving real-world datasets -- fatal vehicle
accidents and urban crime. Results demonstrate the system's ability to support
the discovery and analysis of interpretable patterns in complex spatiotemporal
contexts.

Motivation: 解决使用摄像头导致隐私问题或多个IMU/标记物的高成本问题，让臂膀踪踪技术更易于普及

Method: 利用普通智能手机和手表的UWB功能获取绝对距离信息，结合IMU悬洞仪的相对位置数据，通过数据融合算法估算手腐和肘关节位置

Result: 在不需用户提供训练数据的情况下，实现了中位数平均误差11.0厘米的臂膀位置估计精度

Conclusion: 证明了使用普通消费级智能设备可以实现高精度的臂膀踪踪，为健康、康复、AR输入等应用领域提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: The ability to track a user's arm pose could be valuable in a wide range of
applications, including fitness, rehabilitation, augmented reality input, life
logging, and context-aware assistants. Unfortunately, this capability is not
readily available to consumers. Systems either require cameras, which carry
privacy issues, or utilize multiple worn IMUs or markers. In this work, we
describe how an off-the-shelf smartphone and smartwatch can work together to
accurately estimate arm pose. Moving beyond prior work, we take advantage of
more recent ultra-wideband (UWB) functionality on these devices to capture
absolute distance between the two devices. This measurement is the perfect
complement to inertial data, which is relative and suffers from drift. We
quantify the performance of our software-only approach using off-the-shelf
devices, showing it can estimate the wrist and elbow joints with a \hl{median
positional error of 11.0~cm}, without the user having to provide training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的数据分析系统存在幻觉风险、推理不透明和用户控制减少的问题，需要一种既能利用GenAI优势又能保持统计严谨性的解决方案。

Method: 采用混合架构：GenAI负责自然语言意图到统计公式的翻译，交互式可视化展示模型行为、残差模式和假设比较，所有模型拟合、诊断和假设测试由结构化R后端处理。

Result: 开发了一个结合GenAI意图翻译和可视化驱动推理的系统，在保持统计严谨性的同时扩大了建模工具的可访问性。

Conclusion: 通过约束GenAI在高层次角色并与可视化、结构化后端结合，可以在不牺牲严谨性的前提下提升数据分析的自然语言交互体验，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in Generative AI have transformed how users interact with
data analysis through natural language interfaces. However, many systems rely
too heavily on LLMs, creating risks of hallucination, opaque reasoning, and
reduced user control. We present a hybrid visual analysis system that
integrates GenAI in a constrained, high-level role to support statistical
modeling while preserving transparency and user agency. GenAI translates
natural language intent into formal statistical formulations, while interactive
visualizations surface model behavior, residual patterns, and hypothesis
comparisons to guide iterative exploration. Model fitting, diagnostics, and
hypothesis testing are delegated entirely to a structured R-based backend,
ensuring correctness, interpretability, and reproducibility. By combining
GenAI-assisted intent translation with visualization-driven reasoning, our
approach broadens access to modeling tools without compromising rigor. We
present an example use case of the tool and discuss challenges and
opportunities for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI代理越来越多地代替人类做决策（如写邮件、购物等），需要研究这种委托决策如何影响人类身份认同的形成和表达。

Method: 使用1000名美国用户的11万条社交媒体行为数据，比较通用AI代理、个性化AI代理与人类基准在人际独特性和个人选择多样性方面的差异。

Result: 两种AI代理都使用户选择趋向流行选项，降低行为独特性。个性化代理虽然减轻同质化程度，但更强烈地压缩用户偏好多样性，限制探索范围。

Conclusion: AI代理可能使人类体验扁平化，通用与个性化代理存在独特性-多样性权衡，设计系统时需要平衡增强人类能动性与保护思想多样性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly act on people's behalf: they write
emails, buy groceries, and book restaurants. While the outsourcing of human
decision-making to AI can be both efficient and effective, it raises a
fundamental question: how does delegating identity-defining choices to AI
reshape who people become? We study the impact of agentic LLMs on two
identity-relevant outcomes: interpersonal distinctiveness - how unique a
person's choices are relative to others - and intrapersonal diversity - the
breadth of a single person's choices over time. Using real choices drawn from
social-media behavior of 1,000 U.S. users (110,000 choices in total), we
compare a generic and personalized agent to a human baseline. Both agents shift
people's choices toward more popular options, reducing the distinctiveness of
their behaviors and preferences. While the use of personalized agents tempers
this homogenization (compared to the generic AI), it also more strongly
compresses the diversity of people's preference portfolios by narrowing what
they explore across topics and psychological affinities. Understanding how AI
agents might flatten human experience, and how using generic versus
personalized agents involves distinctiveness-diversity trade-offs, is critical
for designing systems that augment rather than constrain human agency, and for
safeguarding diversity in thought, taste, and expression.

Abstract: Augmented reality (AR) enhances user interaction with the real world but also
presents vulnerabilities, particularly through Visual Information Manipulation

user confusion and misdirected actions. In this demo, we present a hands-on
experience using a miniature city setup, where users interact with manipulated

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PR分析需要大量标注数据进行模型微调，这既费时又需要专业知识，限制了PR研究人员应用大语言模型的能力。

Method: 采用Chain-of-Thought提示技术，将PR专业知识直接整合到LLM的推理过程中，并提供可视化界面展示模型的推理路径和线索。

Result: 通过两个真实用例验证了有效性，定量评估显示优于其他LLM和提示策略，定性评估表明系统具有良好可用性和效果。

Conclusion: OPRA-Vis成功解决了PR分析中数据标注的瓶颈问题，为大语言模型在公共关系领域的应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Analysis of public opinions collected from digital media helps organizations
maintain positive relationships with the public. Such public relations (PR)
analysis often involves assessing opinions, for example, measuring how strongly
people trust an organization. Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) hold
great promise for supporting Organization-Public Relationship Assessment (OPRA)
because they can map unstructured public text to OPRA dimensions and articulate
rationales through prompting. However, adapting LLMs for PR analysis typically
requires fine-tuning on large labeled datasets, which is both labor-intensive
and knowledge-intensive, making it difficult for PR researchers to apply these
models. In this paper, we present OPRA-Vis, a visual analytics system that
leverages LLMs for OPRA without requiring extensive labeled data. Our framework
employs Chain-of-Thought prompting to guide LLMs in analyzing public opinion
data by incorporating PR expertise directly into the reasoning process.
Furthermore, OPRA-Vis provides visualizations that reveal the clues and
reasoning paths used by LLMs, enabling users to explore, critique, and refine
model decisions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of OPRA-Vis through two
real-world use cases and evaluate it quantitatively, through comparisons with
alternative LLMs and prompting strategies, and qualitatively, through
assessments of usability, effectiveness, and expert feedback.

Motivation: 自动语音识别系统通常忽略感叹词（如"mmm"、"hmm"），而这些感叹词在人机对话中对表达同意、犹豫或请求信息至关重要。

Method: 收集专门的感叹词数据集，训练基线深度学习模型，并使用节奏和音高变换等数据增帽技术来提升模型性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作为感叹词分类领域开创了先河，解决了感叹词信号短暂性和语者变异性带来的挑战，为改善人机对话自然性贡献了重要技术基础。

Abstract: In the realm of human-computer interaction, fostering a natural dialogue
between humans and machines is paramount. A key, often overlooked, component of
this dialogue is the use of interjections such as "mmm" and "hmm". Despite
their frequent use to express agreement, hesitation, or requests for
information, these interjections are typically dismissed as "non-words" by
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) engines. Addressing this gap, we introduce a
novel task dedicated to interjection classification, a pioneer in the field to
our knowledge. This task is challenging due to the short duration of
interjection signals and significant inter- and intra-speaker variability. In
this work, we present and publish a dataset of interjection signals collected
specifically for interjection classification. We employ this dataset to train
and evaluate a baseline deep learning model. To enhance performance, we augment
the training dataset using techniques such as tempo and pitch transformation,
which significantly improve classification accuracy, making models more robust.
The interjection dataset, a Python library for the augmentation pipeline,
baseline model, and evaluation scripts, are available to the research
community.

Motivation: 随着增强现实技术在移动和现场感知应用中的普及，音频提示在引导用户实现物理环境导航中的作用越来越重要

Method: 使用Meta Quest 3头显设备，让20名参与者在外出环境中完成五条导航路线，测试五种不同类型的音频提示（人造声音、自然声音、Spearcons、乐器声音、听觉图标），并收集主观评价数据

Result: 不同音响类型在新鲜感和刺激性方面存在显著差异：人造声音和乐器声音在新鲜感方面评分高于Spearcons，人造声音在刺激性方面也更高。总体偏好在自然声音和人造声音之间均匀分布

Conclusion: 在AR导航系统的听觉反馈设计中结合新鲜感和用户参与度的元素可以提高系统效果

Abstract: As augmented reality (AR) becomes increasingly prevalent in mobile and
context-aware applications, the role of auditory cues in guiding users through
physical environments is becoming critical. This study investigates the
effectiveness and user experience of various categories of audio cues,
including fully non-verbal sounds and speech-derived Spearcons, during outdoor
navigation tasks using the Meta Quest 3 headset. Twenty participants navigated
five outdoor routes using audio-only cue types: Artificial Sounds, Nature
Sounds, Spearcons, Musical Instruments, and Auditory Icons. Subjective
evaluations were collected to assess the perceived effectiveness and user
experience of each sound type. Results revealed significant differences in
perceived novelty and stimulation across sound types. Artificial Sounds and
Musical Instruments were rated higher than Spearcons in novelty, while
Artificial Sounds were also rated higher than Spearcons in stimulation. Overall
preference was evenly split between Nature Sounds and Artificial Sounds. These
findings suggest that incorporating aspects of novelty and user engagement in
auditory feedback design may enhance the effectiveness of AR navigation
systems.

Motivation: 评估随机卡片子集对卡片分类数据的影响，因为虽然这是几十年的常见做法，但其效果缺乏系统研究

Method: 对160名参与者进行实验，比较完整卡片集和随机60%卡片集的结果，分析样本量要求以及个性和认知因素的影响

Result: 随机子集可产生与标准卡片分类相当的相似性矩阵，但类别主题模式可能不同；数据变异性增加需要更大样本量；个性和认知反思与卡片分类存在交互作用

Conclusion: 为进行卡片分类提供了基于证据的实践方法，同时揭示了研究设计和个体差异对心理模型测量的影响

Abstract: To keep card sorting with a lot of cards concise, a common strategy for
gauging mental models involves presenting participants with fewer randomly
selected cards instead of the full set. This is a decades-old practice, but its
effects lacked systematic examination. To assess how randomized subsets affect
data, we conducted an experiment with 160 participants. We compared results
between full and randomized 60\% card sets, then analyzed sample size
requirements and the impacts of individual personality and cognitive factors.
Our results demonstrate that randomized subsets can yield comparable similarity
matrices to standard card sorting, but thematic patterns in categories can
differ. Increased data variability also warrants larger sample sizes (25-35 for
60% card subset). Results indicate that personality traits and cognitive
reflection interact with card sorting. Our research suggests evidence-based
practices for conducting card sorting while exposing the influence of study
design and individual differences on measurement of mental models.

TL;DR: 论文主张超越简单的概率量化，采用更丰富的专业不确定性表达方式，通过参与式精炼过程让专业社区共同塑造AI不确定性沟通方式


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在专业领域的应用中，许多关键决策中的不确定性无法用概率量化（如医疗中的家庭暴力判断、教育中的文化敏感性评估），需要更丰富的不确定性表达方式

Method: 提出参与式精炼过程，让专业社区集体参与塑造不同形式不确定性的沟通方式，将不确定性表达视为专业意义构建过程而非算法优化

Result: 建立了专业社区集体开发不确定性表达框架的方法论，强调不确定性沟通需要专业共识而非单纯技术方案

Conclusion: AI在专业领域的成功整合需要超越简单量化，采用由专业社区共同开发的丰富不确定性表达方式，这是专业意义构建的社会过程

Abstract: The growing integration of large language models across professional domains
transforms how experts make critical decisions in healthcare, education, and
law. While significant research effort focuses on getting these systems to
communicate their outputs with probabilistic measures of reliability, many
consequential forms of uncertainty in professional contexts resist such
quantification. A physician pondering the appropriateness of documenting
possible domestic abuse, a teacher assessing cultural sensitivity, or a
mathematician distinguishing procedural from conceptual understanding face
forms of uncertainty that cannot be reduced to percentages. This paper argues
for moving beyond simple quantification toward richer expressions of
uncertainty essential for beneficial AI integration. We propose participatory
refinement processes through which professional communities collectively shape
how different forms of uncertainty are communicated. Our approach acknowledges
that uncertainty expression is a form of professional sense-making that
requires collective development rather than algorithmic optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI工具在认知密集型任务（如笔记）中的广泛应用，需要研究不同级别的AI辅助如何影响用户的认知参与度和理解能力，以解决AI辅助可能增强或削弱认知参与的困境。

Method: 采用within-subject实验设计，30名参与者在观看讲座视频时在三种条件下记笔记：全自动AI（高度辅助，结构化笔记）、中等AI（适度辅助，实时摘要）和最小AI（低度辅助，仅提供转录文本）。

Result: 中等AI辅助条件产生最高的后测成绩，全自动AI辅助条件成绩最低。但参与者偏好全自动设置，因其感知易用性和较低认知努力，表明偏好便利性与认知效益之间存在差异。

Conclusion: 研究为设计保持认知参与的AI辅助提供了见解，建议在认知任务中设计适度的AI支持，平衡用户便利性与学习效果的最佳点在于中等程度的辅助水平。

Abstract: As AI tools become increasingly embedded in cognitively demanding tasks such
as note-taking, questions remain about whether they enhance or undermine
cognitive engagement. This paper examines the "AI Assistance Dilemma" in
note-taking, investigating how varying levels of AI support affect user
engagement and comprehension. In a within-subject experiment, we asked
participants (N=30) to take notes during lecture videos under three conditions:
Automated AI (high assistance with structured notes), Intermediate AI (moderate
assistance with real-time summary, and Minimal AI (low assistance with
transcript). Results reveal that Intermediate AI yields the highest post-test
scores and Automated AI the lowest. Participants, however, preferred the
automated setup due to its perceived ease of use and lower cognitive effort,
suggesting a discrepancy between preferred convenience and cognitive benefits.
Our study provides insights into designing AI assistance that preserves
cognitive engagement, offering implications for designing moderate AI support
in cognitive tasks.

Abstract: This paper studies a finite-horizon Markov decision problem with
information-theoretic constraints, where the goal is to minimize directed
information from the controlled source process to the control process, subject
to stage-wise cost constraints, aiming for an optimal control policy. We
propose a new way of approximating a solution for this problem, which is known
to be formulated as an unconstrained MDP with a continuous information-state
using Q-factors. To avoid the computational complexity of discretizing the
continuous information-state space, we propose a truncated rollout-based
backward-forward approximate dynamic programming (ADP) framework. Our approach
consists of two phases: an offline base policy approximation over a shorter
time horizon, followed by an online rollout lookahead minimization, both
supported by provable convergence guarantees. We supplement our theoretical
results with a numerical example where we demonstrate the cost improvement of
the rollout method compared to a previously proposed policy approximation
method, and the computational complexity observed in executing the offline and
online phases for the two methods.

Abstract: The increasing integration of renewable energy sources has introduced complex
dynamic behavior in power systems that challenge the adequacy of traditional
continuous-time modeling approaches. These developments call for modeling
frameworks that can capture the intricate interplay between continuous dynamics
and discrete events characterizing modern grid operations. Hybrid dynamical
systems offer a rigorous foundation for representing such mixed dynamics and
have emerged as a valuable tool in power system analysis. Despite their
potential, existing studies remain focused on isolated applications or
case-specific implementations, offering limited generalizability and guidance
for model selection. This paper addresses that gap by providing a comprehensive
overview of hybrid modeling approaches relevant to power systems. It critically
examines key formalisms, including hybrid automata, switched systems, and
piecewise affine models, evaluating their respective strengths, limitations,
and suitability across control, stability, and system design tasks. In doing
so, the paper identifies open challenges and outlines future research
directions to support the systematic application of hybrid methods in
renewable-rich, converter-dominated power systems

Conclusion: Koopman-based控制方法在非线性系统控制中具有重要价值，但需要在算子理论、近似理论和非线性控制的交叉领域进一步解决开放挑战。

Abstract: Controlling nonlinear dynamical systems remains a central challenge in a wide
range of applications, particularly when accurate first-principle models are
unavailable. Data-driven approaches offer a promising alternative by designing
controllers directly from observed trajectories. A wide range of data-driven
methods relies on the Koopman-operator framework that enables linear
representations of nonlinear dynamics via lifting into higher-dimensional
observable spaces. Finite-dimensional approximations, such as extended dynamic
mode decomposition (EDMD) and its controlled variants, make prediction and
feedback control tractable but introduce approximation errors that must be
accounted for to provide rigorous closed-loop guarantees. This survey provides
a systematic overview of Koopman-based control, emphasizing the connection
between data-driven surrogate models generated from finite data, approximation
errors, controller design, and closed-loop guarantees. We review theoretical
foundations, error bounds, and both linear and bilinear EDMD-based control
schemes, highlighting robust strategies that ensure stability and performance.
Finally, we discuss open challenges and future directions at the interface of
operator theory, approximation theory, and nonlinear control.

Abstract: Approximate methods to solve stochastic optimal control (SOC) problems have
received significant interest from researchers in the past decade.
Probabilistic inference approaches to SOC have been developed to solve
nonlinear quadratic Gaussian problems. In this work, we propose an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) based inference procedure to generate
state-feedback controls for constrained SOC problems. We consider the
inequality constraints for the state and controls and also the structural
constraints for the controls. We employ barrier functions to address state and
control constraints. We show that the expectation step leads to smoothing of
the state-control pair while the the maximization step on the non-zero subsets
of the control parameters allows inference of structured stochastic optimal
controllers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm on unicycle
obstacle avoidance, four-unicycle formation control, and quadcopter navigation
in windy environment examples. In these examples, we perform an empirical study
on the parametric effect of barrier functions on the state constraint
satisfaction. We also present a comparative study of smoothing algorithms on
the performance of the proposed approach.

Result: 模拟实验显示该策略在动态环境下能够显著提高网络覆盖率，超越了静态部署方案，具有良好的可扩展性和实际应用价值

Conclusion: 该分布式梯度基于部署策略通过本地信息处理和动态优化，有效提升了混合传感网络在复杂环境下的覆盖性能，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: This paper presents a distributed gradient-based deployment strategy to
maximize coverage in hybrid wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with probabilistic
sensing. Leveraging Voronoi partitioning, the overall coverage is reformulated
as a sum of local contributions, enabling mobile sensors to optimize their
positions using only local information. The strategy adopts the Elfes model to
capture detection uncertainty and introduces a dynamic step size based on the
gradient of the local coverage, ensuring movements adaptive to regional
importance. Obstacle awareness is integrated via visibility constraints,
projecting sensor positions to unobstructed paths. A threshold-based decision
rule ensures movement occurs only for sufficiently large coverage gains, with
convergence achieved when all sensors and their neighbors stop at a local
maximum configuration. Simulations demonstrate improved coverage over static
deployments, highlighting scalability and practicality for real-world
applications.

Abstract: Demand response providers (DRPs) are intermediaries between the upper-level
distribution system operator and the lower-level participants in demand
response (DR) programs. Usually, DRPs act as leaders and determine electricity
pricing strategies to maximize their economic revenue, while end-users adjust
their power consumption following the pricing signals. However, this
profit-seeking bi-level optimization model often neglects the satisfaction of
end-users participating in DR programs. In addition, the detailed mathematical
models underlying user decision-making strategy and satisfaction evaluation
mechanism are typically unavailable to DRPs, posing significant challenges to
conventional model-based solution methods. To address these issues, this paper
designs a user-side satisfaction evaluation mechanism and proposes a
multi-branch temporal fusion twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient
(MBTF-TD3) reinforcement learning algorithm. User satisfaction feedback is
incorporated into the reward function via a dynamically adjusted penalty term.
The proposed MBTF structure effectively extracts temporal feature dependencies
in the time-series observation data, and the dynamically adjusted penalty
function successfully enhances the overall satisfaction level of users. Several
experiments are conducted to validate the performance and the effectiveness of
our proposed solution algorithm.

Abstract: Inspired by spiking neural feedback, we propose a spiking controller for
efficient locomotion in a soft robotic crawler. Its bistability, akin to neural
fast positive feedback, combined with a sensorimotor slow negative feedback
loop, generates rhythmic spiking. The closed-loop system is robust through the
quantized actuation, and negative feedback ensures efficient locomotion with
minimal external tuning. We prove that peristaltic waves arise from a
supercritical Hopf bifurcation controlled by the sensorimotor gain. Dimensional
analysis reveals a separation of mechanical and electrical timescales, and
Geometric Singular Perturbation analysis explains endogenous crawling through
relaxation oscillations. We further formulate and analytically solve an
optimization problem in the singularly perturbed regime, proving that crawling
at mechanical resonance maximizes speed by a matching of neuromechanical
scales. Given the importance and ubiquity of rhythms and waves in soft-bodied
locomotion, we envision that spiking control systems could be utilized in a
variety of soft-robotic morphologies and modular distributed architectures,
yielding significant robustness, adaptability, and energetic gains across
scales.

Abstract: Coordinating the interactions between flexibility assets in multi-carrier
integrated energy systems (MIES) can lead to an efficient integration of
variable renewable energy resources, and a cost-efficient energy transition.
However, the proliferation of flexibility assets and their participation in
active demand response increases the complexity of coordinating these
interactions. This paper introduces different approaches to model the
coordination of flexibility scheduling in MIES. We propose a market
auction-inspired model coupling approach to address the challenges of
preserving the autonomy and privacy of flexibility providers, and the issue of
scalability. We benchmark our approach against co-optimization and an iterative
price-response method by conducting experiments with varying problem sizes and
computing infrastructure. We show that our approach scales well and is suitable
for modeling flexibility in large-scale energy systems in a more realistic way.
From an optimality standpoint, the flexibility dispatch schedules and
electricity prices are ``near-optimal". Our methodology is implemented as a new
open-source software, which offers several practical applications. For example,
flexibility providers and network operators can couple their models to simulate
the interaction between their systems without disclosing confidential
information; policy regulators can use it to investigate new market design and
regulations to optimize the utilization of flexibility in MIES.

Abstract: This article addresses the moving target enclosing control problem for
nonholonomic multi-agent systems with guaranteed network connectivity and
collision avoidance. We propose a novel control scheme to handle distance
constraints imposed by the agents' limited interaction ranges and
collision-free thresholds. By leveraging a Henneberg construction method, we
innovatively formulate the target enclosing requirements within an isostatic
distance-based formation framework, facilitating the integration of distance
constraints. Compared with existing results, our approach ensures the positive
definiteness of the underlying rigidity matrix and does not require controlling
the target's motion. To eliminate the occurrences of control singularities
caused by nonholonomic constraints, we propose a fixed-time angular control law
using barrier Lyapunov functions. Additionally, we develop a linear velocity
control law using the prescribed performance control approach and transformed
error constraints. We rigorously prove that our control laws enable the
multi-agent system to asymptotically achieve the desired angular formation
pattern around a moving target while satisfying the established distance
constraints. Finally, a simulation example is provided to validate the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: How much energy must an embodied agent spend to remember its past actions? We
present Tangential Action Spaces (TAS), a differential-geometric framework
revealing a fundamental trade-off between memory and energy in embodied agents.
By modeling agents as hierarchical manifolds with projections Phi: P -> C and
Psi: C -> I connecting physical (P), cognitive (C), and intentional (I) spaces,
we show that the geometry of Phi dictates both memory mechanisms and their
energetic costs. Our main contributions are: (1) a rigorous classification
proving that one-to-one projections (diffeomorphisms) require engineered
dynamics for memory while many-to-one projections (fibrations) enable intrinsic
geometric memory through connection curvature; (2) a proof that any deviation
from the energy-minimal lift incurs a quantifiable penalty, establishing that
path-dependent behavior necessarily costs energy; and (3) a universal principle
that excess cost Delta E scales with the square of accumulated holonomy
(geometric memory). We validate this cost-memory duality through five systems:
the strip-sine system (engineered memory, Delta E proportional to (Delta h)^2),
helical and twisted fibrations (intrinsic geometric memory), and
flat/cylindrical fibrations (proving curvature, not topology, creates memory).
This framework bridges geometric mechanics and embodied cognition, explaining
biological motor diversity and providing design principles for efficient
robotic control.

Abstract: This paper employs Geometric Algebra (GA) tools to model the dynamics of
objects in 3-dimensional space, serving as a proof of concept to facilitate
control design for trajectory tracking in underactuated systems. For control
purposes, the model is structured as a cascade system, where a rotational
subsystem drives a translational one. The rotational subsystem is linear, while
the translational subsystem follows a linear-plus-perturbation form, thereby
reducing the complexity of control design. A control strategy requiring only
simple operations, no memory, and no iterative search loops is presented to
illustrate the main features of the GA model. By employing GA to model both
translations and rotations, a singularity-free and geometrically intuitive
representation can be achieved through the use of the geometric product.
Closed-loop stability is rigorously established using input-to-state stability
methods. Numerical simulations of a quad tilt-rotorcraft performing trajectory
tracking in a windy environment validate the controller's stability and
performance.

Result: 即使是最局部化的版本也能成功重构到目标形状，重构速度随可用信息量增加而提高。仅使用最近邻交互就能实现近乎最优的重构，几何深度学习方法相比标准架构优势有限。

Conclusion: 成功展示了模块自组装系统的局部控制方法，该方法可推广到其他空间相关系统，如滑动立方体模块化机器人和立方星群。

Abstract: We present a decentralized model for autonomous reconfiguration of
homogeneous pivoting cube modular robots in two dimensions. Each cube in the
ensemble is controlled by a neural network that only gains information from
other cubes in its local neighborhood, trained using reinforcement learning.
Furthermore, using geometric deep learning, we include the grid symmetries of
the cube ensemble in the neural network architecture. We find that even the
most localized versions succeed in reconfiguring to the target shape, although
reconfiguration happens faster the more information about the whole ensemble is
available to individual cubes. Near-optimal reconfiguration is achieved with
only nearest neighbor interactions by using multiple information passing
between cubes, allowing them to accumulate more global information about the
ensemble. Compared to standard neural network architectures, using geometric
deep learning approaches provided only minor benefits. Overall, we successfully
demonstrate mostly local control of a modular self-assembling system, which is
transferable to other space-relevant systems with different action spaces, such
as sliding cube modular robots and CubeSat swarms.

TL;DR: 提出了动态门控神经元(DGN)，通过模拟生物神经元的动态电导机制来增强SNN的鲁棒性和抗噪声能力，在多个基准测试中表现出色


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LIF神经元模型过于简化，忽略了生物神经元中动态电导机制的重要作用，限制了SNN处理噪声和时间变化的能力

Method: 从功能角度重新审视动态电导，提出DGN模型，其中膜电导会根据神经元活动动态演化，实现选择性输入过滤和自适应噪声抑制

Result: 理论分析显示DGN比标准LIF模型具有更强的随机稳定性，在抗噪声任务和时序相关基准测试(TIDIGITS、SHD)中表现出卓越的鲁棒性

Conclusion: 首次证明了生物合理的动态门控机制是稳健脉冲计算的关键，为构建更具弹性、高效和生物启发的SNN开辟了新途径

Abstract: While spiking neural networks (SNNs) provide a biologically inspired and
energy-efficient computational framework, their robustness and the dynamic
advantages inherent to biological neurons remain significantly underutilized
owing to oversimplified neuron models. In particular, conventional leaky
integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons often omit the dynamic conductance mechanisms
inherent in biological neurons, thereby limiting their capacity to cope with
noise and temporal variability. In this work, we revisit dynamic conductance
from a functional perspective and uncover its intrinsic role as a biologically
plausible gating mechanism that modulates information flow. Building on this
insight, we introduce the Dynamic Gated Neuron~(DGN), a novel spiking unit in
which membrane conductance evolves in response to neuronal activity, enabling
selective input filtering and adaptive noise suppression. We provide a
theoretical analysis showing that DGN possess enhanced stochastic stability
compared to standard LIF models, with dynamic conductance intriguingly acting
as a disturbance rejection mechanism. DGN-based SNNs demonstrate superior
performance across extensive evaluations on anti-noise tasks and
temporal-related benchmarks such as TIDIGITS and SHD, consistently exhibiting
excellent robustness. Our results highlight, for the first time, a biologically
plausible dynamic gating as a key mechanism for robust spike-based computation,
providing not only theoretical guarantees but also strong empirical
validations. This work thus paves the way for more resilient, efficient, and
biologically inspired spiking neural networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在连续空间场中统一符号计算、物理模拟和感知推理，提供一个可微的计算框架来桥接离散算法和连续场动力学。

Method: 结合神经控制器、连续记忆场和可移动读写头，在每个时间步读取局部补丁，通过学习规则计算更新并写回，同时更新头位置，使用固定半径邻域实现线性缩放。

Result: 展示了三个实例：元胞自动机模拟（Rule 110）、物理信息PDE求解器（2D热方程）和迭代图像细化（CIFAR-10修复），这些实例能够学习局部更新规则组成全局动力学，表现出稳定的长时程展开，并能泛化到训练时域之外。

Conclusion: NFTM提供了一个统一的计算基底，在单个可微框架内桥接了离散算法和连续场动力学。

Abstract: We introduce the Neural Field Turing Machine (NFTM), a differentiable
architecture that unifies symbolic computation, physical simulation, and
perceptual inference within continuous spatial fields. NFTM combines a neural
controller, continuous memory field, and movable read/write heads that perform
local updates. At each timestep, the controller reads local patches, computes
updates via learned rules, and writes them back while updating head positions.
This design achieves linear O(N) scaling through fixed-radius neighborhoods
while maintaining Turing completeness under bounded error. We demonstrate three
example instantiations of NFTM: cellular automata simulation (Rule 110),
physics-informed PDE solvers (2D heat equation), and iterative image refinement
(CIFAR-10 inpainting). These instantiations learn local update rules that
compose into global dynamics, exhibit stable long-horizon rollouts, and
generalize beyond training horizons. NFTM provides a unified computational
substrate bridging discrete algorithms and continuous field dynamics within a
single differentiable framework.

Method: 开发了一种通用性强化学习算法，通过试错学习实现优化控制，在动态运动场景中训练四足机器人策略

Result: 学习到的策略在性能上可与最先进的专家策略相比拼，但培训时只需要25%的代理数量，显著提高了培训效率

Conclusion: 强化学习提供了一种有效的通用性解决方案，能够在减少资源消耗的同时实现高性能的四足机器人运动控制

Abstract: Climbing, crouching, bridging gaps, and walking up stairs are just a few of
the advantages that quadruped robots have over wheeled robots, making them more
suitable for navigating rough and unstructured terrain. However, executing such
manoeuvres requires precise temporal coordination and complex agent-environment
interactions. Moreover, legged locomotion is inherently more prone to slippage
and tripping, and the classical approach of modeling such cases to design a
robust controller thus quickly becomes impractical. In contrast, reinforcement
learning offers a compelling solution by enabling optimal control through trial
and error. We present a generalist reinforcement learning algorithm for
quadrupedal agents in dynamic motion scenarios. The learned policy rivals
state-of-the-art specialist policies trained using a mixture of experts
approach, while using only 25% as many agents during training. Our experiments
also highlight the key components of the generalist locomotion policy and the
primary factors contributing to its success.

Abstract: The paper presents an experiment on the effects of adaptive emotional

in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). Using the NAO robot, we investigate the
impact of an emotionally aligned, empathic, dialogue on these aspects: (i) the
robot's persuasive effectiveness, (ii) the user's communication style, and
(iii) the attribution of mental states and empathy to the robot. In an
experiment with 42 participants, two conditions were compared: one with neutral
communication and another where the robot provided responses adapted to the
emotions expressed by the users. The results show that emotional alignment does
not influence users' communication styles or have a persuasive effect. However,
it significantly influences attribution of mental states to the robot and its
perceived empathy

Abstract: Studying tissue samples obtained during autopsies is the gold standard when
diagnosing the cause of death and for understanding disease pathophysiology.
Recently, the interest in post mortem minimally invasive biopsies has grown
which is a less destructive approach in comparison to an open autopsy and
reduces the risk of infection. While manual biopsies under ultrasound guidance
are more widely performed, robotic post mortem biopsies have been recently
proposed. This approach can further reduce the risk of infection for
physicians. However, planning of the procedure and control of the robot need to
be efficient and usable. We explore a virtual reality setup with a digital twin
to realize fully remote planning and control of robotic post mortem biopsies.
The setup is evaluated with forensic pathologists in a usability study for
three interaction methods. Furthermore, we evaluate clinical feasibility and
evaluate the system with three human cadavers. Overall, 132 needle insertions
were performed with an off-axis needle placement error of 5.30+-3.25 mm. Tissue
samples were successfully biopsied and histopathologically verified. Users
reported a very intuitive needle placement approach, indicating that the system
is a promising, precise, and low-risk alternative to conventional approaches.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Autonomously controlling quadrotors in large-scale subterranean environments
is applicable to many areas such as environmental surveying, mining operations,
and search and rescue. Learning-based controllers represent an appealing
approach to autonomy, but are known to not generalize well to
`out-of-distribution' environments not encountered during training. In this
work, we train a normalizing flow-based prior over the environment, which
provides a measure of how far out-of-distribution the quadrotor is at any given
time. We use this measure as a runtime monitor, allowing us to switch between a
learning-based controller and a safe controller when we are sufficiently
out-of-distribution. Our methods are benchmarked on a point-to-point navigation
task in a simulated 3D cave environment based on real-world point cloud data
from the DARPA Subterranean Challenge Final Event Dataset. Our experimental
results show that our combined controller simultaneously possesses the liveness
of the learning-based controller (completing the task quickly) and the safety
of the safety controller (avoiding collision).

Abstract: The small scale of urban farms and the commercial availability of low-cost
robots (such as the FarmBot) that automate simple tending tasks enable an
accessible platform for plant phenotyping. We have used a FarmBot with a custom
camera end-effector to estimate strawberry plant flower pose (for robotic
pollination) from acquired 3D point cloud models. We describe a novel algorithm
that translates individual occupancy grids along orthogonal axes of a point
cloud to obtain 2D images corresponding to the six viewpoints. For each image,
2D object detection models for flowers are used to identify 2D bounding boxes
which can be converted into the 3D space to extract flower point clouds. Pose
estimation is performed by fitting three shapes (superellipsoids, paraboloids
and planes) to the flower point clouds and compared with manually labeled
ground truth. Our method successfully finds approximately 80% of flowers
scanned using our customized FarmBot platform and has a mean flower pose error
of 7.7 degrees, which is sufficient for robotic pollination and rivals previous
results. All code will be made available at

Abstract: The quasi-repetitive nature of construction work and the resulting lack of
generalizability in programming construction robots presents persistent
challenges to the broad adoption of robots in the construction industry. Robots
cannot achieve generalist capabilities as skills learnt from one domain cannot
readily transfer to another work domain or be directly used to perform a
different set of tasks. Human workers have to arduously reprogram their
scene-understanding, path-planning, and manipulation components to enable the
robots to perform alternate work tasks. The methods presented in this paper
resolve a significant proportion of such reprogramming workload by proposing a
generalizable learning architecture that directly teaches robots versatile
task-performance skills through crowdsourced online natural language
instructions. A Large Language Model (LLM), a standardized and modularized
hierarchical modeling approach, and Building Information Modeling-Robot sematic
data pipeline are developed to address the multi-task skill transfer problem.
The proposed skill standardization scheme and LLM-based hierarchical skill
learning framework were tested with a long-horizon drywall installation
experiment using a full-scale industrial robotic manipulator. The resulting
robot task learning scheme achieves multi-task reprogramming with minimal
effort and high quality.

Motivation: 传统动态SLAM系统在移除动态特征后导致点特征不足，而现有方法不分情况地不断添加特征，造成计算费用和性能降级。

Method: 提出特征感知机制，评估当前特征是否足够以决定是否激活线性特征支持。在后续处理中，线性特征只用于跟踪、局部地图和循环关闭，但排除在全局优化外。

Conclusion: 该特征感知机制能够有效减少计算复杂度，同时最小化低质量特征和噪声的引入，实现了更高效的动态SLAM。

Abstract: Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) plays a crucial role in
autonomous systems. Traditional SLAM methods, based on static environment
assumptions, struggle to handle complex dynamic environments. Recent dynamic
SLAM systems employ geometric constraints and deep learning to remove dynamic
features, yet this creates a new challenge: insufficient remaining point
features for subsequent SLAM processes. Existing solutions address this by
continuously introducing additional line and plane features to supplement point
features, achieving robust tracking and pose estimation. However, current
methods continuously introduce additional features regardless of necessity,
causing two problems: unnecessary computational overhead and potential
performance degradation from accumulated low-quality additional features and
noise. To address these issues, this paper proposes a feature-aware mechanism
that evaluates whether current features are adequate to determine if line
feature support should be activated. This decision mechanism enables the system
to introduce line features only when necessary, significantly reducing
computational complexity of additional features while minimizing the
introduction of low-quality features and noise. In subsequent processing, the
introduced line features assist in obtaining better initial camera poses
through tracking, local mapping, and loop closure, but are excluded from global
optimization to avoid potential negative impacts from low-quality additional
features in long-term process. Extensive experiments on TUM datasets
demonstrate substantial improvements in both ATE and RPE metrics compared to
ORB-SLAM3 baseline and superior performance over other dynamic SLAM and
multi-feature methods.

Abstract: Autonomous underwater navigation remains a challenging problem due to limited
sensing capabilities and the difficulty of constructing accurate maps in
underwater environments. In this paper, we propose a Diffusion-based Underwater
Visual Navigation policy via knowledge-transferred depth features, named DUViN,
which enables vision-based end-to-end 4-DoF motion control for underwater
vehicles in unknown environments. DUViN guides the vehicle to avoid obstacles
and maintain a safe and perception awareness altitude relative to the terrain
without relying on pre-built maps. To address the difficulty of collecting
large-scale underwater navigation datasets, we propose a method that ensures
robust generalization under domain shifts from in-air to underwater
environments by leveraging depth features and introducing a novel model
transfer strategy. Specifically, our training framework consists of two phases:
we first train the diffusion-based visual navigation policy on in-air datasets
using a pre-trained depth feature extractor. Secondly, we retrain the extractor
on an underwater depth estimation task and integrate the adapted extractor into
the trained navigation policy from the first step. Experiments in both
simulated and real-world underwater environments demonstrate the effectiveness
and generalization of our approach. The experimental videos are available at

Abstract: In recent years, wheeled bipedal robots have gained increasing attention due
to their advantages in mobility, such as high-speed locomotion on flat terrain.
However, their performance on complex environments (e.g., staircases) remains
inferior to that of traditional legged robots. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a general contact-triggered blind climbing (CTBC) framework for wheeled
bipedal robots. Upon detecting wheel-obstacle contact, the robot triggers a
leg-lifting motion to overcome the obstacle. By leveraging a strongly-guided
feedforward trajectory, our method enables the robot to rapidly acquire agile
leg-lifting skills, significantly enhancing its capability to traverse
unstructured terrains. The approach has been experimentally validated and
successfully deployed on LimX Dynamics' wheeled bipedal robot, Tron1.
Real-world tests demonstrate that Tron1 can reliably climb obstacles well
beyond its wheel radius using only proprioceptive feedback.

Conclusion: UT³框架成功解决了测试时训练在实时应用中的推理延迟问题，为自主系统在持续演化环境中的安全部署提供了可行方案

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly being used in autonomous
systems. However, DNNs do not generalize well to domain shift. Adapting to a
continuously evolving environment is a safety-critical challenge inevitably
faced by all autonomous systems deployed to the real world. Recent work on
test-time training proposes methods that adapt to a new test distribution on
the fly by optimizing the DNN model for each test input using self-supervision.
However, these techniques result in a sharp increase in inference time as
multiple forward and backward passes are required for a single test sample (for
test-time training) before finally making the prediction based on the
fine-tuned features. This is undesirable for real-world robotics applications
where these models may be deployed to resource constraint hardware with strong
latency requirements. In this work, we propose a new framework (called UT$^3$)
that leverages test-time training for improved performance in the presence of
continuous domain shift while also decreasing the inference time, making it
suitable for real-world applications. Our method proposes an uncertainty-aware
self-supervision task for efficient test-time training that leverages the
quantified uncertainty to selectively apply the training leading to sharp
improvements in the inference time while performing comparably to standard
test-time training protocol. Our proposed protocol offers a continuous setting
to identify the selected keyframes, allowing the end-user to control how often
to apply test-time training. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on a
dense regression task - monocular depth estimation.

Conclusion: 力平衡操作器设计能够显著减少关节负荷和机器需要，提高精度性能，对高精度应用具有重要价值

Abstract: A force balanced manipulator design based on the closed chain planar five bar
linkage is developed and experimentally validated. We present 2 variants as a
modular design: Forbal-2, a planar 2-DOF manipulator, and its extension to
5-DOF spatial motion called Forbal-5. The design considerations in terms of
geometric, kinematic, and dynamic design that fulfill the force balance
conditions while maximizing workspace are discussed. Then, the inverse
kinematics of both variants are derived from geometric principles.
  We validate the improvements from force balancing the manipulator through
comparative experiments with counter mass balanced and unbalanced
configurations. The results show how the balanced configuration yields a
reduction in the average reaction moments of up to 66\%, a reduction of average
joint torques of up to 79\%, as well as a noticeable reduction in position
error for Forbal-2. For Forbal-5, which has a higher end effector payload mass,
the joint torques are reduced up to 84\% for the balanced configuration.
Experimental results validate that the balanced manipulator design is suitable
for applications where the reduction of joint torques and reaction
forces/moments helps achieve millimeter level precision.

Method: 采用两阶段策略：初始训练集选择(ITSS)通过轨迹分析构建多样化初始数据集，主动增量选择(AIS)利用场景重建和预测不一致性迭代选择复杂场景样本

Result: 在多种数据集和天气条件下验证有效，仅使用52%序列数据即可达到全数据集训练的性能水平

Conclusion: 该主动训练框架能够优化训练过程，为更灵活可靠的LiDAR测程系统奠定基础，提升在多样环境条件下的准确性和稳健性

Abstract: Robust and efficient deep LiDAR odometry models are crucial for accurate
localization and 3D reconstruction, but typically require extensive and diverse
training data to adapt to diverse environments, leading to inefficiencies. To
tackle this, we introduce an active training framework designed to selectively
extract training data from diverse environments, thereby reducing the training
load and enhancing model generalization. Our framework is based on two key
strategies: Initial Training Set Selection (ITSS) and Active Incremental
Selection (AIS). ITSS begins by breaking down motion sequences from general
weather into nodes and edges for detailed trajectory analysis, prioritizing
diverse sequences to form a rich initial training dataset for training the base
model. For complex sequences that are difficult to analyze, especially under
challenging snowy weather conditions, AIS uses scene reconstruction and
prediction inconsistency to iteratively select training samples, refining the
model to handle a wide range of real-world scenarios. Experiments across
datasets and weather conditions validate our approach's effectiveness. Notably,
our method matches the performance of full-dataset training with just 52\% of
the sequence volume, demonstrating the training efficiency and robustness of
our active training paradigm. By optimizing the training process, our approach
sets the stage for more agile and reliable LiDAR odometry systems, capable of
navigating diverse environmental conditions with greater precision.

Abstract: Intuitive Teleoperation interfaces are essential for mobile manipulation
robots to ensure high quality data collection while reducing operator workload.
A strong sense of embodiment combined with minimal physical and cognitive
demands not only enhances the user experience during large-scale data
collection, but also helps maintain data quality over extended periods. This
becomes especially crucial for challenging long-horizon mobile manipulation
tasks that require whole-body coordination. We compare two distinct robot
control paradigms: a coupled embodiment integrating arm manipulation and base
navigation functions, and a decoupled embodiment treating these systems as
separate control entities. Additionally, we evaluate two visual feedback
mechanisms: immersive virtual reality and conventional screen-based
visualization of the robot's field of view. These configurations were
systematically assessed across a complex, multi-stage task sequence requiring
integrated planning and execution. Our results show that the use of VR as a
feedback modality increases task completion time, cognitive workload, and
perceived effort of the teleoperator. Coupling manipulation and navigation
leads to a comparable workload on the user as decoupling the embodiments, while
preliminary experiments suggest that data acquired by coupled teleoperation
leads to better imitation learning performance. Our holistic view on intuitive
teleoperation interfaces provides valuable insight into collecting
high-quality, high-dimensional mobile manipulation data at scale with the human
operator in mind. Project

Abstract: The utilization of robotic technology has gained traction in healthcare
facilities due to progress in the field that enables time and cost savings,
minimizes waste, and improves patient care. Digital healthcare technologies
that leverage automation, such as robotics and artificial intelligence, have
the potential to enhance the sustainability and profitability of healthcare
systems in the long run. However, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has amplified
the need for cyber-physical robots to automate check-ups and medication
administration. A robot nurse is controlled by the Internet of Things (IoT) and
can serve as an automated medical assistant while also allowing supervisory
control based on custom commands. This system helps reduce infection risk and
improves outcomes in pandemic settings. This research presents a test case with
a nurse robot that can assess a patient's health status and take action
accordingly. We also evaluate the system's performance in medication
administration, health-status monitoring, and life-cycle considerations.

Method: 设计了一个关注决策制定的实验框架，通过变化机器人外观和自我知识进行小规模测试，使用定性分析评估交互质量、说服效果和沟通策略。

Result: 参与者对交互感受正面，认为机器人能干、友好且支持性强，但也指出了响应延迟和语音识别错误等实际限制。说服效果与情境密切相关，参与者对礼貌、合理的建议和表情丰富的手势反应称赞，但需要更个性化、情境感知的论据和更清晰的社会角色。

Conclusion: 生成式社交机器人可以影响用户决策，但效果取决于沟通细节和情境相关性。研究建议精炼框架以深入研究机器人与人类用户之间的说服动态。

Abstract: Integrating generative AI such as large language models into social robots
has improved their ability to engage in natural, human-like communication. This
study presents a method to examine their persuasive capabilities. We designed
an experimental framework focused on decision making and tested it in a pilot
that varied robot appearance and self-knowledge. Using qualitative analysis, we
evaluated interaction quality, persuasion effectiveness, and the robot's
communicative strategies. Participants generally experienced the interaction
positively, describing the robot as competent, friendly, and supportive, while
noting practical limits such as delayed responses and occasional
speech-recognition errors. Persuasiveness was highly context dependent and
shaped by robot behavior: participants responded well to polite, reasoned
suggestions and expressive gestures, but emphasized the need for more
personalized, context-aware arguments and clearer social roles. These findings
suggest that generative social robots can influence user decisions, but their
effectiveness depends on communicative nuance and contextual relevance. We
propose refinements to the framework to further study persuasive dynamics
between robots and human users.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive refurbishment of the interactive robotic
art installation Standards and Double Standards by Rafael Lozano-Hemmer. The
installation features an array of belts suspended from the ceiling, each
actuated by stepper motors and dynamically oriented by a vision-based tracking
system that follows the movements of exhibition visitors. The original system
was limited by oscillatory dynamics, resulting in torsional and pendulum-like
vibrations that constrained rotational speed and reduced interactive
responsiveness. To address these challenges, the refurbishment involved
significant upgrades to both hardware and motion control algorithms. A detailed
mathematical model of the flying belt system was developed to accurately
capture its dynamic behavior, providing a foundation for advanced control
design. An input shaping method, formulated as a convex optimization problem,
was implemented to effectively suppress vibrations, enabling smoother and
faster belt movements. Experimental results demonstrate substantial
improvements in system performance and audience interaction. This work
exemplifies the integration of robotics, control engineering, and interactive
art, offering new solutions to technical challenges in real-time motion control
and vibration damping for large-scale kinetic installations.

Conclusion: 并行计算方法能够有效提高非线性约束系统的安全性和控制性能，为安全关键系统提供了实用的解决方案

Abstract: Ensuring constraint satisfaction is a key requirement for safety-critical
systems, which include most robotic platforms. For example, constraints can be
used for modeling joint position/velocity/torque limits and collision
avoidance. Constrained systems are often controlled using Model Predictive
Control, because of its ability to naturally handle constraints, relying on
numerical optimization. However, ensuring constraint satisfaction is
challenging for nonlinear systems/constraints. A well-known tool to make
controllers safe is the so-called control-invariant set (a.k.a. safe set). In
our previous work, we have shown that safety can be improved by letting the
safe-set constraint recede along the MPC horizon. In this paper, we push that
idea further by exploiting parallel computation to improve safety. We solve
several MPC problems at the same time, where each problem instantiates the
safe-set constraint at a different time step along the horizon. Finally, the
controller can select the best solution according to some user-defined
criteria. We validated this idea through extensive simulations with a 3-joint
robotic arm, showing that significant improvements can be achieved in terms of
safety and performance, even using as little as 4 computational cores.

Abstract: Advancements in onboard computing mean remote sensing agents can employ
state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning at the edge. These
capabilities can be leveraged to unlock new rare, transient, and pinpoint
measurements of dynamic science phenomena. In this paper, we present an
automated workflow that synthesizes the detection of these dynamic events in
look-ahead satellite imagery with autonomous trajectory planning for a
follow-up high-resolution sensor to obtain pinpoint measurements. We apply this
workflow to the use case of observing volcanic plumes. We analyze
classification approaches including traditional machine learning algorithms and
convolutional neural networks. We present several trajectory planning
algorithms that track the morphological features of a plume and integrate these
algorithms with the classifiers. We show through simulation an order of
magnitude increase in the utility return of the high-resolution instrument
compared to baselines while maintaining efficient runtimes.

TL;DR: 研究发现Waymo开放运动数据集(WOMD)无法准确反映真实自动驾驶车辆的行为动态，特别是在短车距和急减速场景中存在系统性低估，建议使用该数据集时需要进行独立验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估WOMD数据集在自动驾驶行为分析中的有效性，因为该数据集存在专有后处理、缺乏误差量化以及轨迹分段等问题，对其真实性存疑。

Method: 使用凤凰城L4级自动驾驶自然数据集(PHX)进行对比分析，涵盖信号交叉口通行、跟车和变道三种典型场景。采用人工提取车头时距、SIMEX方法处理测量误差、DTW距离量化行为差异。

Result: 在所有测试场景中，PHX数据的行为都超出了WOMD的行为范围，WOMD明显低估了短车距和急减速行为。

Conclusion: 仅基于WOMD校准的行为模型可能系统性地低估自然驾驶的变异性、风险和复杂性，使用WOMD进行行为建模时需要谨慎并进行独立数据验证。

Abstract: The Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) has become a popular resource for
data-driven modeling of autonomous vehicles (AVs) behavior. However, its
validity for behavioral analysis remains uncertain due to proprietary
post-processing, the absence of error quantification, and the segmentation of
trajectories into 20-second clips. This study examines whether WOMD accurately
captures the dynamics and interactions observed in real-world AV operations.
Leveraging an independently collected naturalistic dataset from Level 4 AV
operations in Phoenix, Arizona (PHX), we perform comparative analyses across
three representative urban driving scenarios: discharging at signalized
intersections, car-following, and lane-changing behaviors. For the discharging
analysis, headways are manually extracted from aerial video to ensure
negligible measurement error. For the car-following and lane-changing cases, we
apply the Simulation-Extrapolation (SIMEX) method to account for empirically
estimated error in the PHX data and use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances to
quantify behavioral differences. Results across all scenarios consistently show
that behavior in PHX falls outside the behavioral envelope of WOMD. Notably,
WOMD underrepresents short headways and abrupt decelerations. These findings
suggest that behavioral models calibrated solely on WOMD may systematically
underestimate the variability, risk, and complexity of naturalistic driving.
Caution is therefore warranted when using WOMD for behavior modeling without
proper validation against independently collected data.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation, a key frontier in robotics and embodied AI, requires
precise motor control and multimodal understanding, yet traditional rule-based
methods fail to scale or generalize in unstructured, novel environments. In
recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, built upon Large
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pretrained on vast image-text datasets, have
emerged as a transformative paradigm. This survey provides the first
systematic, taxonomy-oriented review of large VLM-based VLA models for robotic
manipulation. We begin by clearly defining large VLM-based VLA models and
delineating two principal architectural paradigms: (1) monolithic models,
encompassing single-system and dual-system designs with differing levels of
integration; and (2) hierarchical models, which explicitly decouple planning
from execution via interpretable intermediate representations. Building on this
foundation, we present an in-depth examination of large VLM-based VLA models:
(1) integration with advanced domains, including reinforcement learning,
training-free optimization, learning from human videos, and world model
integration; (2) synthesis of distinctive characteristics, consolidating
architectural traits, operational strengths, and the datasets and benchmarks
that support their development; (3) identification of promising directions,
including memory mechanisms, 4D perception, efficient adaptation, multi-agent
cooperation, and other emerging capabilities. This survey consolidates recent
advances to resolve inconsistencies in existing taxonomies, mitigate research
fragmentation, and fill a critical gap through the systematic integration of
studies at the intersection of large VLMs and robotic manipulation. We provide
a regularly updated project page to document ongoing progress:

Abstract: We present a comparative docking experiment that aligns human-subject
interview data with large language model (LLM)-driven synthetic personas to
evaluate fidelity, divergence, and blind spots in AI-enabled simulation.
Fifteen early-stage startup founders were interviewed about their hopes and
concerns regarding AI-powered validation, and the same protocol was replicated
with AI-generated founder and investor personas. A structured thematic
synthesis revealed four categories of outcomes: (1) Convergent themes -
commitment-based demand signals, black-box trust barriers, and efficiency gains
were consistently emphasized across both datasets; (2) Partial overlaps -
founders worried about outliers being averaged away and the stress of real
customer validation, while synthetic personas highlighted irrational blind
spots and framed AI as a psychological buffer; (3) Human-only themes -
relational and advocacy value from early customer engagement and skepticism
toward moonshot markets; and (4) Synthetic-only themes - amplified false
positives and trauma blind spots, where AI may overstate adoption potential by
missing negative historical experiences.
  We interpret this comparative framework as evidence that LLM-driven personas
constitute a form of hybrid social simulation: more linguistically expressive
and adaptable than traditional rule-based agents, yet bounded by the absence of
lived history and relational consequence. Rather than replacing empirical
studies, we argue they function as a complementary simulation category -
capable of extending hypothesis space, accelerating exploratory validation, and
clarifying the boundaries of cognitive realism in computational social science.

Result: 在三个重要ABMs(Axtell公司模型、Sugarscape、SIR传染病模型)上实验，显示了显著的性能提升和计算节省

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了ABMs在复杂系统研究中的实用性和可扩展性

Abstract: Agent-based models (ABMs) simulate complex systems by capturing the bottom-up
interactions of individual agents comprising the system. Many complex systems
of interest, such as epidemics or financial markets, involve thousands or even
millions of agents. Consequently, ABMs often become computationally demanding
and rely on the calibration of numerous free parameters, which has
significantly hindered their widespread adoption. In this paper, we demonstrate
that automatic differentiation (AD) techniques can effectively alleviate these
computational burdens. By applying AD to ABMs, the gradients of the simulator
become readily available, greatly facilitating essential tasks such as
calibration and sensitivity analysis. Specifically, we show how AD enables
variational inference (VI) techniques for efficient parameter calibration. Our
experiments demonstrate substantial performance improvements and computational
savings using VI on three prominent ABMs: Axtell's model of firms; Sugarscape;
and the SIR epidemiological model. Our approach thus significantly enhances the
practicality and scalability of ABMs for studying complex systems.

Abstract: In decision-dependent games, multiple players optimize their decisions under
a data distribution that shifts with their joint actions, creating complex
dynamics in applications like market pricing. A practical consequence of these
dynamics is the \textit{performatively stable equilibrium}, where each player's
strategy is a best response under the induced distribution. Prior work relies
on $\beta$-smoothness, assuming Lipschitz continuity of loss function gradients
with respect to the data distribution, which is impractical as the data
distribution maps, i.e., the relationship between joint decision and the
resulting distribution shifts, are typically unknown, rendering $\beta$
unobtainable. To overcome this limitation, we propose a gradient-based
sensitivity measure that directly quantifies the impact of decision-induced
distribution shifts. Leveraging this measure, we derive convergence guarantees
for performatively stable equilibria under a practically feasible assumption of
strong monotonicity. Accordingly, we develop a sensitivity-informed repeated
retraining algorithm that adjusts players' loss functions based on the
sensitivity measure, guaranteeing convergence to performatively stable
equilibria for arbitrary data distribution maps. Experiments on prediction
error minimization game, Cournot competition, and revenue maximization game
show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving lower
losses and faster convergence.

Abstract: Auto-bidding is central to computational advertising, achieving notable
commercial success by optimizing advertisers' bids within economic constraints.
Recently, large generative models show potential to revolutionize auto-bidding
by generating bids that could flexibly adapt to complex, competitive
environments. Among them, diffusers stand out for their ability to address
sparse-reward challenges by focusing on trajectory-level accumulated rewards,
as well as their explainable capability, i.e., planning a future trajectory of
states and executing bids accordingly. However, diffusers struggle with
generation uncertainty, particularly regarding dynamic legitimacy between
adjacent states, which can lead to poor bids and further cause significant loss
of ad impression opportunities when competing with other advertisers in a
highly competitive auction environment. To address it, we propose a Causal
auto-Bidding method based on a Diffusion completer-aligner framework, termed
CBD. Firstly, we augment the diffusion training process with an extra random
variable t, where the model observes t-length historical sequences with the
goal of completing the remaining sequence, thereby enhancing the generated
sequences' dynamic legitimacy. Then, we employ a trajectory-level return model
to refine the generated trajectories, aligning more closely with advertisers'
objectives. Experimental results across diverse settings demonstrate that our
approach not only achieves superior performance on large-scale auto-bidding
benchmarks, such as a 29.9% improvement in conversion value in the challenging
sparse-reward auction setting, but also delivers significant improvements on
the Kuaishou online advertising platform, including a 2.0% increase in target
cost.

Method: 在VoxCeleb1数据集上评估三种最先进的说话人验证模型，测试传统和神经音频编解码器在不同比特率下的性能表现

Result: 所有编解码器和模型都随比特率降低而性能下降；神经编解码器在低比特率(<12kbps)下比Opus优6-8%，在高比特率(≈24kbps)下EER仅增加0.4-0.7%

Conclusion: 神经音频编解码器是传统编解码器的可行替代方案，特别适合带宽受限场景；未来需要开发说话人感知的神经编解码器或重新训练适应模型

Abstract: Neural audio codecs (NACs) have made significant advancements in recent years
and are rapidly being adopted in many audio processing pipelines. However, they
can introduce audio distortions which degrade speaker verification (SV)
performance. This study investigates the impact of both traditional and neural
audio codecs at varying bitrates on three state of-the-art SV models evaluated
on the VoxCeleb1 dataset. Our findings reveal a consistent degradation in SV
performance across all models and codecs as bitrates decrease. Notably, NACs do
not fundamentally break SV performance when compared to traditional codecs.
They outperform Opus by 6-8% at low-bitrates (< 12 kbps) and remain marginally
behind at higher bitrates ($\approx$ 24 kbps), with an EER increase of only
0.4-0.7%. The disparity at higher bitrates is likely due to the primary
optimization of NACs for perceptual quality, which can inadvertently discard
critical speaker-discriminative features, unlike Opus which was designed to
preserve vocal characteristics. Our investigation suggests that NACs are a
feasible alternative to traditional codecs, especially under bandwidth
limitations. To bridge the gap at higher bitrates, future work should focus on
developing speaker-aware NACs or retraining and adapting SV models.

Abstract: Parallel to the development of advanced deepfake audio generation, audio
deepfake detection has also seen significant progress. However, a standardized
and comprehensive benchmark is still missing. To address this, we introduce
Speech DeepFake (DF) Arena, the first comprehensive benchmark for audio

detection systems, currently across 14 diverse datasets and attack scenarios,
standardized evaluation metrics and protocols for reproducibility and
transparency. It also includes a leaderboard to compare and rank the systems to
help researchers and developers enhance their reliability and robustness. We
include 14 evaluation sets, 12 state-of-the-art open-source and 3 proprietary
detection systems. Our study presents many systems exhibiting high EER in
out-of-domain scenarios, highlighting the need for extensive cross-domain
evaluation. The leaderboard is hosted on Huggingface1 and a toolkit for
reproducing results across the listed datasets is available on GitHub.

TL;DR: 通过门控机制提取XLS-R模型特征，结合多内核卷积和中心内核对齐控制特征多样性，提出了一种高效的语音深作偷检测方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有语音深作偷检测方法在未见攻击和多语言场景下的泛化性不足问题

Method: 使用XLS-R模型作为前端特征提取器，采用门控机制提取关键特征，后端使用多内核卷积(MultiConv)捕捉局部和全局特征，并使用中心内核对齐(CKA)保证各层特征的多样性

Result: 在域内测试集上达到最佳性能，同时在域外多语言数据集上也表现出良好的泛化能力

Conclusion: 该方法为检测日益发展的语音深作偷威胁提供了一种灵活有效的解决方案

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative AI, particularly in speech synthesis, have
enabled the generation of highly natural-sounding synthetic speech that closely
mimics human voices. While these innovations hold promise for applications like
assistive technologies, they also pose significant risks, including misuse for
fraudulent activities, identity theft, and security threats. Current research
on spoofing detection countermeasures remains limited by generalization to
unseen deepfake attacks and languages. To address this, we propose a gating
mechanism extracting relevant feature from the speech foundation XLS-R model as
a front-end feature extractor. For downstream back-end classifier, we employ
Multi-kernel gated Convolution (MultiConv) to capture both local and global
speech artifacts. Additionally, we introduce Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) as
a similarity metric to enforce diversity in learned features across different
MultiConv layers. By integrating CKA with our gating mechanism, we hypothesize
that each component helps improving the learning of distinct synthetic speech
patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on in-domain benchmarks while generalizing
robustly to out-of-domain datasets, including multilingual speech samples. This
underscores its potential as a versatile solution for detecting evolving speech
deepfake threats.

*Hritik Arasu,Faisal R Jahangiri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种流式、无源测试时自适应方法，结合熵最小化、批归一化统计更新和安全机制，用于睡眠分期模型在未见过的生理或记录条件下的自适应部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 睡眠分期模型在面对未见过的生理特征或记录条件时性能会下降，需要一种无需源数据或患者校准的实用自适应方法。

Method: 使用流式无源测试时自适应（TTA）方法，结合熵最小化（Tent）、批归一化统计刷新，以及两个安全机制：熵门控（在不确定窗口暂停自适应）和EMA重置（防止漂移）。

Result: 在Sleep-EDF Expanded数据集上，使用单导联EEG数据，相比冻结基线模型在秒级延迟和最小内存占用下获得一致性能提升，报告了各阶段指标和Cohen's k值。

Conclusion: 该方法具有模型无关性，无需源数据或患者校准，适用于设备端或床旁使用，为睡眠分期模型的实际部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Sleep staging models often degrade when deployed on patients with unseen
physiology or recording conditions. We propose a streaming, source-free
test-time adaptation (TTA) recipe that combines entropy minimization (Tent)
with Batch-Norm statistic refresh and two safety rails: an entropy gate to
pause adaptation on uncertain windows and an EMA-based reset to reel back
drift. On Sleep-EDF Expanded, using single-lead EEG (Fpz-Cz, 100 Hz, 30s
epochs; R&K to AASM mapping), we show consistent gains over a frozen baseline
at seconds-level latency and minimal memory, reporting per-stage metrics and
Cohen's k. The method is model-agnostic, requires no source data or patient
calibration, and is practical for on-device or bedside use.

TL;DR: 通过长期神经元失活和状态记忆机制，提出Lifecycle原则，解决神经元复活时的训练不稳定问题，提升模型的泛化能力和稳健性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前正则化方法如Dropout仅为瞬时性变化，本文探索长期失活神经元的更强正则化效果，但这会导致神经元复活时的严重训练不稳定问题。

Method: 提出Lifecycle(LC)原则，采用状态记忆机制：神经元复活时不重新初始化，而是恢复到上次有效状态，保留已学习知识。理论分析显示该方法能平滑损失函数地形。

Result: 在图像分类开测数据集上，方法显著提升了模型的泛化能力和稳健性。分离实验确认状态记忆机制对性能提升的关键作用。

Conclusion: Lifecycle原则通过状态记忆有效解决了长期神经元失活带来的训练挑战，导向更平坦的最小值，为深度学习正则化提供了新的视角。

Abstract: I investigate a stronger form of regularization by deactivating neurons for
extended periods, a departure from the temporary changes of methods like
Dropout. However, this long-term dynamism introduces a critical challenge:
severe training instability when neurons are revived with random weights. To
solve this, I propose the Lifecycle (LC) principle, a regularization mechanism
centered on a key innovation: state memory. Instead of re-initializing a
revived neuron, my method restores its parameters to their last known effective
state. This process preserves learned knowledge and avoids destructive
optimization shocks. My theoretical analysis reveals that the LC principle
smooths the loss landscape, guiding optimization towards flatter minima
associated with better generalization. Experiments on image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that my method improves generalization and robustness.
Crucially, ablation studies confirm that state memory is essential for
achieving these gains.

Abstract: Protecting endangered wildlife from illegal poaching presents a critical
challenge, particularly in vast and partially observable environments where
real-time response is essential. This paper introduces a novel
Expectation-Maximization (EM) based latent variable modeling approach in the
context of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle (UAV) coordination in wildlife protection. By modeling hidden
environmental factors and inter-agent dynamics through latent variables, our
method enhances exploration and coordination under uncertainty.We implement and
evaluate our EM-MARL framework using a custom simulation involving 10 UAVs
tasked with patrolling protected habitats of the endangered Iranian leopard.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate superior performance in detection
accuracy, adaptability, and policy convergence when compared to standard
algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Deep Deterministic
Policy Gradient (DDPG). Our findings underscore the potential of combining EM
inference with MARL to improve decentralized decisionmaking in complex,
high-stakes conservation scenarios. The full implementation, simulation
environment, and training scripts are publicly available on GitHub.

TL;DR: 群体感知阈值校准方法通过为不同人口群体设置不同的决策阈值，在解决类别不平衡问题上比传统合成数据生成方法更有效，能提高平衡准确率和最差群体性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 类别不平衡是机器学习中的基本挑战，传统解决方案往往带来新问题。需要找到更稳健、更有效的方法来处理不同人口群体间的性能差异。

Method: 提出群体感知阈值校准方法，为不同人口群体设置不同的决策阈值，而不是对所有群体使用单一阈值。通过优化平衡准确率和最差群体平衡准确率之间的帕累托前沿来实现精细控制。

Result: 实验显示该方法比SMOTE和CT-GAN等合成数据增强方法提高1.5-4%的平衡准确率，同时改善最差群体平衡准确率。在七个模型家族（线性、树基、实例基和提升方法）上都得到验证。

Conclusion: 群体感知阈值校准提供了一种更简单、更可解释、更有效的类别不平衡解决方案，相比合成数据增强方法具有显著优势，且两者结合使用效果提升有限，说明这些方法存在根本冗余。

Abstract: Class imbalance remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning, with
traditional solutions often creating as many problems as they solve. We
demonstrate that group-aware threshold calibration--setting different decision
thresholds for different demographic groups--provides superior robustness
compared to synthetic data generation methods. Through extensive experiments,
we show that group-specific thresholds achieve 1.5-4% higher balanced accuracy
than SMOTE and CT-GAN augmented models while improving worst-group balanced
accuracy. Unlike single-threshold approaches that apply one cutoff across all
groups, our group-aware method optimizes the Pareto frontier between balanced
accuracy and worst-group balanced accuracy, enabling fine-grained control over
group-level performance. Critically, we find that applying group thresholds to
synthetically augmented data yields minimal additional benefit, suggesting
these approaches are fundamentally redundant. Our results span seven model
families including linear, tree-based, instance-based, and boosting methods,
confirming that group-aware threshold calibration offers a simpler, more
interpretable, and more effective solution to class imbalance.

Result: 在真实世界母婴移动健康项目和标准对齐基准测试中，DPO-PRO相比现有DPO变体在噪声偏好信号下表现更鲁棒，且与自反思基线性能相当但推理成本显著降低。

Conclusion: DPO-PRO是一种有效的鲁棒对齐方法，能够在复杂公共卫生场景中处理偏好不确定性，同时保持较低的计算开销。

Abstract: We study an LLM fine-tuning task for designing reward functions for
sequential resource allocation problems in public health, guided by human
preferences expressed in natural language. This setting presents a challenging
testbed for alignment due to complex and ambiguous objectives and limited data
availability. We propose DPO-PRO, a robust fine-tuning algorithm based on
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which accounts for uncertainty in the
preference distribution using a lightweight Distributionally Robust
Optimization (DRO) formulation. Unlike prior DRO-based DPO methods, DPO-PRO is
significantly less conservative. We evaluate DPO-PRO on a real-world maternal
mobile health program operated by the non-profit organization ARMMAN, as well
as on standard alignment benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method consistently improves robustness to noisy preference signals compared to
existing DPO variants. Moreover, DPO-PRO achieves comparable performance to
prior self-reflection-based baseline for reward function design, while
requiring significantly lower inference-time cost.

Abstract: Mean Field Games (MFGs) offer a powerful framework for studying large-scale
multi-agent systems. Yet, learning Nash equilibria in MFGs remains a
challenging problem, particularly when the initial distribution is unknown or
when the population is subject to common noise. In this paper, we introduce an
efficient deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm designed to achieve
population-dependent Nash equilibria without relying on averaging or historical
sampling, inspired by Munchausen RL and Online Mirror Descent. The resulting
policy is adaptable to various initial distributions and sources of common
noise. Through numerical experiments on seven canonical examples, we
demonstrate that our algorithm exhibits superior convergence properties
compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, particularly a DRL version of
Fictitious Play for population-dependent policies. The performance in the
presence of common noise underscores the robustness and adaptability of our
approach.

TL;DR: 本文发现强化学习中策略梯度方法在特定约束下会出现动作坍缩现象，即状态-动作激活向最优动作均值坍缩，并提出了使用固定等角紧框架作为动作选择层的ACPG方法，能更快更鲁棒地提升奖励。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注策略网络的收敛性和全局最优性，但很少分析底层网络的表征结构。作者观察到在训练最优策略DNN时会出现类似神经坍缩的动作坍缩现象，这启发了使用固定ETF结构作为目标配置的想法。

Method: 提出了动作坍缩策略梯度(ACPG)方法，在动作选择层固定一个合成的等角紧框架(ETF)结构，引导策略DNN产生理想配置同时保持最优性。

Result: 在各种OpenAI Gym环境中的实验表明，ACPG可以集成到任何离散策略梯度方法中，能够更快、更鲁棒地获得更好的奖励改进。

Conclusion: 使用固定ETF作为动作选择层可以自然引导动作坍缩现象，ACPG方法有效利用了这种结构特性来提升策略梯度方法的性能。

Abstract: Policy gradient (PG) methods in reinforcement learning frequently utilize
deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn a shared backbone of feature
representations used to compute likelihoods in an action selection layer.
Numerous studies have been conducted on the convergence and global optima of
policy networks, but few have analyzed representational structures of those
underlying networks. While training an optimal policy DNN, we observed that
under certain constraints, a gentle structure resembling neural collapse, which
we refer to as Action Collapse (AC), emerges. This suggests that 1) the
state-action activations (i.e. last-layer features) sharing the same optimal
actions collapse towards those optimal actions respective mean activations; 2)
the variability of activations sharing the same optimal actions converges to
zero; 3) the weights of action selection layer and the mean activations
collapse to a simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF). Our early work showed
those aforementioned constraints to be necessary for these observations. Since
the collapsed ETF of optimal policy DNNs maximally separates the pair-wise
angles of all actions in the state-action space, we naturally raise a question:
can we learn an optimal policy using an ETF structure as a (fixed) target
configuration in the action selection layer? Our analytical proof shows that
learning activations with a fixed ETF as action selection layer naturally leads
to the AC. We thus propose the Action Collapse Policy Gradient (ACPG) method,
which accordingly affixes a synthetic ETF as our action selection layer. ACPG
induces the policy DNN to produce such an ideal configuration in the action
selection layer while remaining optimal. Our experiments across various OpenAI
Gym environments demonstrate that our technique can be integrated into any
discrete PG methods and lead to favorable reward improvements more quickly and
robustly.

Motivation: 传统DRL交通信号控制存在两种策略："选择相位"策略可能导致意外相位序列影响驾驶安全，"切换"策略可能导致相位分配不公平和效率低下

Method: 提出Deep Hierarchical Cycle Planner (DHCP)模型，采用分层结构：高层代理根据整体交通状态分配南北和东西方向的总周期时间，低层代理在每个主要方向内进一步分配直行和左转的时间

Result: 在真实和合成的道路网络以及多种交通流数据集上测试，模型在所有数据集上都优于基线方法

Conclusion: DHCP模型通过分层时间分配机制，在保持相位序列可预测性的同时，实现了更灵活和高效的交通信号控制

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has become a popular approach in traffic
signal control (TSC) due to its ability to learn adaptive policies from complex
traffic environments. Within DRL-based TSC methods, two primary control
paradigms are ``choose phase" and ``switch" strategies. Although the agent in
the choose phase paradigm selects the next active phase adaptively, this
paradigm may result in unexpected phase sequences for drivers, disrupting their
anticipation and potentially compromising safety at intersections. Meanwhile,
the switch paradigm allows the agent to decide whether to switch to the next
predefined phase or extend the current phase. While this structure maintains a
more predictable order, it can lead to unfair and inefficient phase
allocations, as certain movements may be extended disproportionately while
others are neglected. In this paper, we propose a DRL model, named Deep
Hierarchical Cycle Planner (DHCP), to allocate the traffic signal cycle
duration hierarchically. A high-level agent first determines the split of the
total cycle time between the North-South (NS) and East-West (EW) directions
based on the overall traffic state. Then, a low-level agent further divides the
allocated duration within each major direction between straight and left-turn
movements, enabling more flexible durations for the two movements. We test our
model on both real and synthetic road networks, along with multiple sets of
real and synthetic traffic flows. Empirical results show our model achieves the
best performance over all datasets against baselines.

Abstract: This work explores the potential of foundation models, specifically a
Mamba-based selective state space model, for enhancing EEG analysis in
neurological disorder diagnosis. EEG, crucial for diagnosing conditions like
epilepsy, presents significant challenges due to its noisy, high-dimensional,
and nonlinear nature. Traditional machine learning methods have made advances
in automating EEG analysis but often fail to capture its complex
spatio-temporal dynamics. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly in
sequence modeling, offer new avenues for creating more generalized and
expressive models capable of handling such complexities. By training a
Mamba-based model on a large dataset containing seizure and non-seizure EEG
recordings through a self-supervised reconstruction task followed by a seizure
detection task, we demonstrate the model's effectiveness, achieving an AUROC of
0.72 on a held-out test set. This approach marks a significant step toward
developing large-scale, clinically applicable foundation models for EEG data
analysis.

Motivation: 现有MoE模型通常在所有层中固定激活相同数量的专家，导致冗余计算和次优性能。传统剪枝方法仅减少内存使用，但无法显著提升GPU推理效率

Method: LExI利用仅模型权重来估计每层的相对重要性，并自适应地为每层分配激活专家数量，是一种无需数据的优化技术

Result: 在先进的语言和视觉MoE基准测试中，LExI显著优于传统MoE剪枝方法，推理效率大幅提升且精度损失可忽略。例如Qwen1.5-MoE在H100 GPU上达到相同吞吐量时精度提升10%

Conclusion: LExI通过层间专家数量自适应分配，有效解决了MoE模型冗余计算问题，在保持模型精度的同时显著提升了推理效率，为MoE模型的实际部署提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models scale efficiently by activating only a subset
of experts per token, offering a computationally sparse alternative to dense
architectures. While prior post-training optimizations, such as inter- and
intra-expert pruning, reduce memory usage they provide limited gains in
inference-time compute efficiency. Moreover, existing MoE architectures
typically activate a fixed number of experts uniformly across all layers,
resulting in redundant computation and suboptimal performance. In this work, we
first demonstrate that MoE pruning strategies improve only the memory footprint
but do not significantly improve inference performance on GPU using optimized
frameworks such as vLLM. To address this, we introduce LExI, a data-free
optimization technique that determines the optimal number of active experts per
layer in a pretrained MoE model. LExI leverages only the model weights to
estimate the relative importance of each layer and adaptively assigns the
number of active experts accordingly per layer. Experiments on state-of-the-art
language and vision MoE benchmarks demonstrate that LExI significantly
outperforms traditional MoE pruning approaches in terms of inference efficiency
with negligible accuracy loss. For example, using LExI, Qwen1.5-MoE achieves
the same throughput on Nvidia H100 GPU with 10% better accuracy than
traditional expert pruning.

Motivation: 为了解决从不同类型、不同稀疏度和分辨率的地下观测数据中重建地下属性的挑战，需要一个能够处理多模态数据并支持灵活扩展的模型架构。

Method: 采用Transformer架构，结合位置编码和模态编码（通过文本嵌入模型生成），支持八种模态（包括方向角度、分类类别和连续属性如温度、厚度等），实现上下文学习和任意模态组合的预测。

Conclusion: Transparent Earth作为地球地下的基础模型，具有处理多模态数据、支持灵活扩展和上下文学习的能力，为预测地球任何地方的地下属性奠定了基础。

Abstract: We present the Transparent Earth, a transformer-based architecture for
reconstructing subsurface properties from heterogeneous datasets that vary in
sparsity, resolution, and modality, where each modality represents a distinct
type of observation (e.g., stress angle, mantle temperature, tectonic plate
type). The model incorporates positional encodings of observations together
with modality encodings, derived from a text embedding model applied to a
description of each modality. This design enables the model to scale to an
arbitrary number of modalities, making it straightforward to add new ones not
considered in the initial design. We currently include eight modalities
spanning directional angles, categorical classes, and continuous properties
such as temperature and thickness. These capabilities support in-context
learning, enabling the model to generate predictions either with no inputs or
with an arbitrary number of additional observations from any subset of
modalities. On validation data, this reduces errors in predicting stress angle
by more than a factor of three. The proposed architecture is scalable and
demonstrates improved performance with increased parameters. Together, these
advances make the Transparent Earth an initial foundation model for the Earth's
subsurface that ultimately aims to predict any subsurface property anywhere on
Earth.

Conclusion: 结构化基函数网络提供了一种统一框架，能够在保持损失几何一致性的同时控制偏差-方差-多样性的平衡

Abstract: Existing approaches to predictive uncertainty rely either on multi-hypothesis
prediction, which promotes diversity but lacks principled aggregation, or on
ensemble learning, which improves accuracy but rarely captures the structured
ambiguity. This implicitly means that a unified framework consistent with the
loss geometry remains absent. The Structured Basis Function Network addresses
this gap by linking multi-hypothesis prediction and ensembling through
centroidal aggregation induced by Bregman divergences. The formulation applies
across regression and classification by aligning predictions with the geometry
of the loss, and supports both a closed-form least-squares estimator and a
gradient-based procedure for general objectives. A tunable diversity mechanism
provides parametric control of the bias-variance-diversity trade-off,
connecting multi-hypothesis generalisation with loss-aware ensemble
aggregation. Experiments validate this relation and use the mechanism to study
the complexity-capacity-diversity trade-off across datasets of increasing
difficulty with deep-learning predictors.

Motivation: 传统消息传递神经网络(MPNNs)随着网络深度增加容易出现过平滑问题，难以有效捕获全局和区域图结构。图拉普拉斯矩阵的低频特征向量编码了全局信息，通过预训练GNN预测这些特征向量可以促使网络自然地学习大规模结构模式。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种有效的图神经网络预训练方法，能够更好地学习图的大规模结构模式，具有广泛的适用性和灵活性。

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for pre-training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by
inductively learning Laplacian eigenvectors. Traditional Message Passing Neural
Networks (MPNNs) often struggle to capture global and regional graph structure
due to over-smoothing risk as network depth increases. Because the
low-frequency eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian matrix encode global
information, pre-training GNNs to predict these eigenvectors encourages the
network to naturally learn large-scale structural patterns over each graph.
Empirically, we show that models pre-trained via our framework outperform
baseline models on a variety of graph structure-based tasks. While most
existing pre-training methods focus on domain-specific tasks like node or edge
feature reconstruction, our self-supervised pre-training framework is
structure-based and highly flexible. Eigenvector-learning can be applied to all
graph-based datasets, and can be used with synthetic features when
task-specific data is sparse.

TL;DR: 本文研究发现视觉语言模型(VLMs)中存在可分离的冲突检测和冲突解决机制，通过线性探测和注意力模式分析揭示了这两种功能在不同网络层中的不同表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型中冲突检测与冲突解决机制难以分离的挑战，以提升模型在复杂多模态场景下的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Method: 对LLaVA-OV-7B模型进行机制性研究，使用线性探测方法提取可线性解码的冲突信号，并通过基于组的注意力模式分析来识别检测和解决阶段。

Result: 发现模型中间层存在可线性解码的冲突信号，冲突检测和解决的注意力模式在网络不同阶段出现分化，证实了这两种机制的功能性分离。

Conclusion: 冲突检测与解决的分解为实现更可操作的可解释性和针对性干预提供了基础，有助于提升模型在挑战性多模态环境中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper highlights the challenge of decomposing conflict detection from
conflict resolution in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and presents potential
approaches, including using a supervised metric via linear probes and
group-based attention pattern analysis. We conduct a mechanistic investigation
of LLaVA-OV-7B, a state-of-the-art VLM that exhibits diverse resolution
behaviors when faced with conflicting multimodal inputs. Our results show that
a linearly decodable conflict signal emerges in the model's intermediate layers
and that attention patterns associated with conflict detection and resolution
diverge at different stages of the network. These findings support the
hypothesis that detection and resolution are functionally distinct mechanisms.
We discuss how such decomposition enables more actionable interpretability and
targeted interventions for improving model robustness in challenging multimodal
settings.

Method: 提出JensUn方法，利用Jensen-Shannon散度作为遗忘集和保留集的训练目标，相比常用损失函数能实现更稳定有效的遗忘动态。同时提出LKF数据集和基于LLM的语义评估框架。

Result: JensUn在广泛实验中比竞争方法获得更好的遗忘-效用权衡，表现出对良性重新学习的强韧性。新的评估框架显示许多现有方法的效果比之前认为的要差。

Conclusion: JensUn提供了一种更有效的大语言模型遗忘解决方案，同时提出的评估框架为未来遗忘方法的研究提供了更精确的测试标准。

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) involves precisely removing
specific information from a pre-trained model. This is crucial to ensure safety
of LLMs by deleting private data or harmful knowledge acquired during
pre-training. However, existing unlearning methods often fall short when
subjected to thorough evaluation. To overcome this, we introduce JensUn, where
we leverage the Jensen-Shannon Divergence as the training objective for both
forget and retain sets for more stable and effective unlearning dynamics
compared to commonly used loss functions. In extensive experiments, JensUn
achieves better forget-utility trade-off than competing methods, and even
demonstrates strong resilience to benign relearning. Additionally, for a
precise unlearning evaluation, we introduce LKF, a curated dataset of
lesser-known facts that provides a realistic unlearning scenario. Finally, to
comprehensively test unlearning methods, we propose (i) employing an LLM as
semantic judge instead of the standard ROUGE score, and (ii) using worst-case
unlearning evaluation over various paraphrases and input formats. Our improved
evaluation framework reveals that many existing methods are less effective than
previously thought.

Motivation: 肥胖是一个重要的全球健康问题，机器学习在早期肥胖风险预测中展现出潜力，但对于混合多数投票咆集成堆叠这两种集成技术的比较评估仍有限。

Method: 使用两个数据集评估三种集成模型：多数硬投票、权重硬投票咆堆叠（以多层感知机作为元分类器）。分析了9种机器学习算法的50个超参数配置，选出前三个模型作为基学习器。预处理步骤包括数据集平衡咆离群点检测，使用准确率咆F1分数评估模型性能。

Abstract: Obesity is a critical global health issue driven by dietary, physiological,
and environmental factors, and is strongly associated with chronic diseases
such as diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and cancer. Machine learning has
emerged as a promising approach for early obesity risk prediction, yet a
comparative evaluation of ensemble techniques -- particularly hybrid majority
voting and ensemble stacking -- remains limited. This study aims to compare
hybrid majority voting and ensemble stacking methods for obesity risk
prediction, identifying which approach delivers higher accuracy and efficiency.
The analysis seeks to highlight the complementary strengths of these ensemble
techniques in guiding better predictive model selection for healthcare
applications. Two datasets were utilized to evaluate three ensemble models:
Majority Hard Voting, Weighted Hard Voting, and Stacking (with a Multi-Layer
Perceptron as meta-classifier). A pool of nine Machine Learning (ML)
algorithms, evaluated across a total of 50 hyperparameter configurations, was
analyzed to identify the top three models to serve as base learners for the
ensemble methods. Preprocessing steps involved dataset balancing, and outlier
detection, and model performance was evaluated using Accuracy and F1-Score. On
Dataset-1, weighted hard voting and stacking achieved nearly identical
performance (Accuracy: 0.920304, F1: 0.920070), outperforming majority hard
voting. On Dataset-2, stacking demonstrated superior results (Accuracy:
0.989837, F1: 0.989825) compared to majority hard voting (Accuracy: 0.981707,
F1: 0.981675) and weighted hard voting, which showed the lowest performance.
The findings confirm that ensemble stacking provides stronger predictive
capability, particularly for complex data distributions, while hybrid majority
voting remains a robust alternative.

Abstract: Conformal prediction has been explored as a general and efficient way to
provide uncertainty quantification for time series. However, current methods
struggle to handle time series data with change points - sudden shifts in the
underlying data-generating process. In this paper, we propose a novel Conformal
Prediction for Time-series with Change points (CPTC) algorithm, addressing this
gap by integrating a model to predict the underlying state with online
conformal prediction to model uncertainties in non-stationary time series. We
prove CPTC's validity and improved adaptivity in the time series setting under
minimum assumptions, and demonstrate CPTC's practical effectiveness on 6
synthetic and real-world datasets, showing improved validity and adaptivity
compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Detecting elephants through seismic signals is an emerging research topic
aimed at developing solutions for Human-Elephant Conflict (HEC). Despite the
promising results, such solutions heavily rely on manual classification of
elephant footfalls, which limits their applicability for real-time
classification in natural settings. To address this limitation and build on our
previous work, this study introduces a classification framework targeting
resource-constrained implementations, prioritizing both accuracy and
computational efficiency. As part of this framework, a novel event detection
technique named Contextually Customized Windowing (CCW), tailored specifically
for detecting elephant footfalls, was introduced, and evaluations were
conducted by comparing it with the Short-Term Average/Long-Term Average
(STA/LTA) method. The yielded results show that the maximum validated detection
range was 155.6 m in controlled conditions and 140 m in natural environments.
Elephant footfall classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a
Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel demonstrated superior performance across
multiple settings, achieving an accuracy of 99% in controlled environments, 73%
in natural elephant habitats, and 70% in HEC-prone human habitats, the most
challenging scenario. Furthermore, feature impact analysis using explainable AI
identified the number of Zero Crossings and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
Alignment Cost as the most influential factors in all experiments, while
Predominant Frequency exhibited significant influence in controlled settings.

Conclusion: 这个TTC框架是向更高级的PDE模型理由算法的基础步骤，包括建立基于强化学习的方法，有望转变物理和工程领域的计算工作流程。

Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are the bedrock for modern
computational sciences and engineering, and inherently computationally
expensive. While PDE foundation models have shown much promise for simulating
such complex spatio-temporal phenomena, existing models remain constrained by
the pretraining datasets and struggle with auto-regressive rollout performance,
especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. Furthermore, they have
significant compute and training data requirements which hamper their use in
many critical applications. Inspired by recent advances in ``thinking"
strategies used in large language models (LLMs), we introduce the first
test-time computing (TTC) strategy for PDEs that utilizes computational
resources during inference to achieve more accurate predictions with fewer
training samples and smaller models. We accomplish this with two types of
reward models that evaluate predictions of a stochastic based model for
spatio-temporal consistency. We demonstrate this method on compressible
Euler-equation simulations from the PDEGym benchmark and show that TTC captures
improved predictions relative to standard non-adaptive auto-regressive
inference. This TTC framework marks a foundational step towards more advanced
reasoning algorithms or PDE modeling, inluding building
reinforcement-learning-based approaches, potentially transforming computational
workflows in physics and engineering.

Abstract: The necessary integration of renewable energy sources, combined with the
expanding scale of power networks, presents significant challenges in
controlling modern power grids. Traditional control systems, which are human
and optimization-based, struggle to adapt and to scale in such an evolving
context, motivating the exploration of more dynamic and distributed control
strategies. This work advances a graph-based distributed reinforcement learning
framework for real-time, scalable grid management. The proposed architecture
consists of a network of distributed low-level agents acting on individual
power lines and coordinated by a high-level manager agent. A Graph Neural
Network (GNN) is employed to encode the network's topological information
within the single low-level agent's observation. To accelerate convergence and
enhance learning stability, the framework integrates imitation learning and
potential-based reward shaping. In contrast to conventional decentralized
approaches that decompose only the action space while relying on global
observations, this method also decomposes the observation space. Each low-level
agent acts based on a structured and informative local view of the environment
constructed through the GNN. Experiments on the Grid2Op simulation environment
show the effectiveness of the approach, which consistently outperforms the
standard baseline commonly adopted in the field. Additionally, the proposed
model proves to be much more computationally efficient than the
simulation-based Expert method.

Abstract: Class imbalance remains a critical challenge in machine learning (ML),
particularly in the medical domain, where underrepresented minority classes
lead to biased models and reduced predictive performance. This study introduces
Quantum-Inspired SMOTE (QI-SMOTE), a novel data augmentation technique that
enhances the performance of ML classifiers, including Random Forest (RF),
Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), k-Nearest Neighbors
(KNN), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Neural Networks, by leveraging quantum
principles such as quantum evolution and layered entanglement. Unlike
conventional oversampling methods, QI-SMOTE generates synthetic instances that
preserve complex data structures, improving model generalization and
classification accuracy. We validate QI-SMOTE on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV
datasets, using mortality detection as a benchmark task due to their clinical
significance and inherent class imbalance. We compare our method against
traditional oversampling techniques, including Borderline-SMOTE, ADASYN,
SMOTE-ENN, SMOTE-TOMEK, and SVM-SMOTE, using key performance metrics such as
Accuracy, F1-score, G-Mean, and AUC-ROC. The results demonstrate that QI-SMOTE
significantly improves the effectiveness of ensemble methods (RF, GB, ADA),
kernel-based models (SVM), and deep learning approaches by producing more
informative and balanced training data. By integrating quantum-inspired
transformations into the ML pipeline, QI-SMOTE not only mitigates class
imbalance but also enhances the robustness and reliability of predictive models
in medical diagnostics and decision-making. This study highlights the potential
of quantum-inspired resampling techniques in advancing state-of-the-art ML
methodologies.

Abstract: Generating synthetic datasets that accurately reflect real-world
observational data is critical for evaluating causal estimators, but remains a
challenging task. Existing generative methods offer a solution by producing
synthetic datasets anchored in the observed data (source data) while allowing
variation in key parameters such as the treatment effect and amount of
confounding bias. However, existing methods typically require users to provide
point estimates of such parameters (rather than distributions) and fixed
estimates (rather than estimates that can be improved with reference to the
source data). This denies users the ability to express uncertainty over
parameter values and removes the potential for posterior inference, potentially
leading to unreliable estimator comparisons. We introduce simulation-based
inference for causal evaluation (SBICE), a framework that models generative
parameters as uncertain and infers their posterior distribution given a source
dataset. Leveraging techniques in simulation-based inference, SBICE identifies
parameter configurations that produce synthetic datasets closely aligned with
the source data distribution. Empirical results demonstrate that SBICE improves
the reliability of estimator evaluations by generating more realistic datasets,
which supports a robust and data-consistent approach to causal benchmarking
under uncertainty.

Abstract: Offloading footwear helps prevent and treat diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) by
lowering plantar pressure (PP), yet prescription decisions remain fragmented:
feature selection varies, personalization is limited, and evaluation practices
differ. We performed a narrative review of 45 studies (12 guidelines/protocols,
25 knowledge-based systems, 8 machine-learning applications) published to Aug
2025. We thematically analyzed knowledge type, decision logic, evaluation
methods, and enabling technologies. Guidelines emphasize PP thresholds (<=200
kPa or >=25--30\% reduction) but rarely yield actionable, feature-level
outputs. Knowledge-based systems use rule- and sensor-driven logic, integrating
PP monitoring, adherence tracking, and usability testing. ML work introduces
predictive, optimization, and generative models with high computational
accuracy but limited explainability and clinical validation. Evaluation remains
fragmented: protocols prioritize biomechanical tests; knowledge-based systems
assess usability/adherence; ML studies focus on technical accuracy with weak
linkage to long-term outcomes. From this synthesis we propose a five-part CDSS
framework: (1) a minimum viable dataset; (2) a hybrid architecture combining
rules, optimization, and explainable ML; (3) structured feature-level outputs;
(4) continuous validation and evaluation; and (5) integration with clinical and
telehealth workflows. This framework aims to enable scalable, patient-centered
CDSSs for DFU care; prioritizing interoperable datasets, explainable models,
and outcome-focused evaluation will be key to clinical adoption.

Abstract: Ensemble method is considered the gold standard for uncertainty
quantification (UQ) for machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs).
However, their high computational cost can limit its practicality. Alternative
techniques, such as Monte Carlo dropout and deep kernel learning, have been
proposed to improve computational efficiency; however, some of these methods
cannot be applied to already trained models and may affect the prediction
accuracy. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient post-hoc framework
for UQ that leverages the descriptor of a trained graph neural network
potential to estimate residual errors. We refer to this method as post-hoc
descriptor-based residual-based learning (PDRL). PDRL models the discrepancy
between MLIP predictions and ground truth values, allowing these residuals to
act as proxies for prediction uncertainty. We explore multiple variants of PDRL
and benchmark them against established UQ methods, evaluating both their
effectiveness and limitations.

Conclusion: Vendi Score提供了一个灵活的多样性评估框架，VendiRL能够学习多样化且多样化的技能集，为强化学习中的技能多样性学习提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: In self-supervised reinforcement learning (RL), one of the key challenges is
learning a diverse set of skills to prepare agents for unknown future tasks.
Despite impressive advances, scalability and evaluation remain prevalent
issues. Regarding scalability, the search for meaningful skills can be obscured
by high-dimensional feature spaces, where relevant features may vary across
downstream task domains. For evaluating skill diversity, defining what
constitutes "diversity" typically requires a hard commitment to a specific
notion of what it means for skills to be diverse, potentially leading to
inconsistencies in how skill diversity is understood, making results across
different approaches hard to compare, and leaving many forms of diversity
unexplored. To address these issues, we adopt a measure of sample diversity
that translates ideas from ecology to machine learning -- the Vendi Score --
allowing the user to specify and evaluate any desired form of diversity. We
demonstrate how this metric facilitates skill evaluation and introduce VendiRL,
a unified framework for learning diversely diverse sets of skills. Given
distinct similarity functions, VendiRL motivates distinct forms of diversity,
which could support skill-diversity pretraining in new and richly interactive
environments where optimising for various forms of diversity may be desirable.

Conclusion: AR-KAN模型成功解决了传统神经网络在非周期信号分析中的挑战，为频谱分析提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Conventional neural networks frequently face challenges in spectral analysis
of signals. To address this challenge, Fourier neural networks (FNNs) and
similar approaches integrate components of Fourier series into the structure of
neural networks. Nonetheless, a significant hurdle is often overlooked: the
superposition of periodic signals does not necessarily result in a periodic
signal. For example, when forecasting almost periodic functions composed of
signals with incommensurate frequencies, traditional models such as
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) frequently outperform most
neural networks including large language models (LLMs). To tackle this goal, we
propose Autoregressive-Weight-Enhanced AR-KAN, a hybrid model that combines the
benefits of both methods. Using the Universal Myopic Mapping Theorem, we apply
a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) for the static nonlinear part and include
memory through a pre-trained AR component, which can be explained to retain the
most useful information while eliminating redundancy. Experimental data
indicates that AR-KAN delivers superior results on $72\%$ of real-world
datasets.

*Kaoru Otsuka,Yuki Takezawa,Makoto Yamada*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出D-Byz-SGDM方法，通过延迟动量聚合解决联邦学习中部分参与下的拜占庭攻击问题，在理论和实验上都证明了有效性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有拜占庭鲁棒联邦学习方法假设全客户端参与，但在实际通信约束和客户端可用性下，部分参与是常态。当采样客户端包含拜占庭多数时，现有方法会立即失效

Method: 提出延迟动量聚合原则，服务器聚合非参与客户端的最新接收梯度与活跃客户端的实时动量。开发D-Byz-SGDM优化器实现这一原则

Result: 建立了收敛保证，恢复了全参与结果并匹配部分参与设置的下界。深度学习实验验证了理论发现，在各种拜占庭攻击下实现稳定鲁棒训练

Conclusion: D-Byz-SGDM方法有效解决了部分参与联邦学习中的拜占庭攻击问题，提供了理论保证和实际验证

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows distributed model training across multiple
clients while preserving data privacy, but it remains vulnerable to Byzantine
clients that exhibit malicious behavior. While existing Byzantine-robust FL
methods provide strong convergence guarantees (e.g., to a stationary point in
expectation) under Byzantine attacks, they typically assume full client
participation, which is unrealistic due to communication constraints and client
availability. Under partial participation, existing methods fail immediately
after the sampled clients contain a Byzantine majority, creating a fundamental
challenge for sparse communication. First, we introduce delayed momentum
aggregation, a novel principle where the server aggregates the most recently
received gradients from non-participating clients alongside fresh momentum from
active clients. Our optimizer D-Byz-SGDM (Delayed Byzantine-robust SGD with
Momentum) implements this delayed momentum aggregation principle for
Byzantine-robust FL with partial participation. Then, we establish convergence
guarantees that recover previous full participation results and match the
fundamental lower bounds we prove for the partial participation setting.
Experiments on deep learning tasks validated our theoretical findings, showing
stable and robust training under various Byzantine attacks.

*Minxin Zhang,Yuxuan Liu,Hayden Schaeffer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdaGO结合了正交化动量更新和AdaGrad自适应学习率，在保持更新方向正交性的同时通过累积梯度范数自适应调整步长，在理论和实验上都优于Muon和Adam。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon优化器通过正交化动量更新在大型语言模型训练中表现出色，但缺乏自适应学习率机制；而AdaGrad虽然自适应但更新方向不保持正交性。需要结合两者的优势。

Method: 将基于范数的AdaGrad型步长与正交化更新方向相结合，仅需增加一个标量变量（累积平方梯度范数）来计算，计算和内存效率高。

Result: 在非凸函数的随机和确定性设置下建立了最优理论收敛速率，在CIFAR-10分类和函数回归任务上实验表明AdaGO优于Muon和Adam。

Conclusion: AdaGO成功结合了正交化更新和自适应学习率的优势，既保持了谱下降方向的特性，又能根据优化景观自适应调整步长，是一种高效且有效的优化算法。

Abstract: The recently proposed Muon optimizer updates weight matrices via
orthogonalized momentum and has demonstrated strong empirical success in large
language model training. However, it remains unclear how to determine the
learning rates for such orthogonalized updates. AdaGrad, by contrast, is a
widely used adaptive method that scales stochastic gradients by accumulated
past gradients. We propose a new algorithm, AdaGO, which combines a norm-based
AdaGrad-type stepsize with an orthogonalized update direction, bringing
together the benefits of both approaches. Unlike other adaptive variants of
Muon, AdaGO preserves the orthogonality of the update direction, which can be
interpreted as a spectral descent direction, while adapting the stepsizes to
the optimization landscape by scaling the direction with accumulated past
gradient norms. The implementation of AdaGO requires only minimal modification
to Muon, with a single additional scalar variable, the accumulated squared
gradient norms, to be computed, making it computationally and memory efficient.
Optimal theoretical convergence rates are established for nonconvex functions
in both stochastic and deterministic settings under standard smoothness and
unbiased bounded-variance noise assumptions. Empirical results on CIFAR-10
classification and function regression demonstrate that AdaGO outperforms Muon
and Adam.

TL;DR: 提出多模态数据融合方法，结合高成本X射线和低成本吸收率数据预测熔池动力学，通过迁移学习实现仅用吸收率数据的高精度预测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监测方法存在成本高或噪声大的问题，X射线成像成本高不实用，光电二极管吸收率数据噪声大且单独使用预测精度不足

Method: 多模态学习框架：CNN提取X射线空间特征，RNN提取吸收率时间特征，采用早期融合策略，并作为迁移学习模型微调RNN模型

Result: 多模态训练显著提高预测精度，训练后模型仅需吸收率数据即可推断熔池特性，无需昂贵X射线成像

Conclusion: 该方法实现了成本效益高的实时监测，在增材制造中具有广泛适用性

Abstract: While multiple sensors are used for real-time monitoring in additive
manufacturing, not all provide practical or reliable process insights. For
example, high-speed X-ray imaging offers valuable spatial information about
subsurface melt pool behavior but is costly and impractical for most industrial
settings. In contrast, absorptivity data from low-cost photodiodes correlate
with melt pool dynamics but is often too noisy for accurate prediction when
used alone. In this paper, we propose a multimodal data fusion approach for
predicting melt pool dynamics by combining high-fidelity X-ray data with
low-fidelity absorptivity data in the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) process.
Our multimodal learning framework integrates convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) for spatial feature extraction from X-ray data with recurrent neural
networks (RNNs) for temporal feature extraction from absorptivity signals,
using an early fusion strategy. The multimodal model is further used as a
transfer learning model to fine-tune the RNN model that can predict melt pool
dynamics only with absorptivity, with greater accuracy compared to the
multimodal model. Results show that training with both modalities significantly
improves prediction accuracy compared to using either modality alone.
Furthermore, once trained, the model can infer melt pool characteristics using
only absorptivity data, eliminating the need for expensive X-ray imaging. This
multimodal fusion approach enables cost-effective, real-time monitoring and has
broad applicability in additive manufacturing.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用预训练大语言模型来自动化科学知识集成的物理信息符号回归方法，通过将LLM评估整合到损失函数中来提高方程金知识的一般性和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的物理信息符号回归方法需要专业的形式化和手工特征工程，限制了其适用性仅仅限于领域专家。需要一种更易于访问和自动化的方法来集成领域知识。

Method: 利用预训练的大语言模型（Falcon、Mistral、LLama 2），将LLM对符号回归产生方程的评估作为一个项整合到SR损失函数中。在三种SR算法（DEAP、gplearn、PySR）和三种物理动力学系统上进行了评估。

Result: LLM集成一致地提高了从数据重建物理动力学的能力，增强了SR模型对噪声和复杂性的稳健性。更信息丰富的提示进一步显著提高了性能。

Conclusion: 通过利用预训练LLM的上下文理解能力，可以自动化领域知识的集成过程，减少手工干预需求，使物理信息符号回归方法更加易于访问并适用于更广泛的科学问题。

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) has emerged as a powerful tool for automated
scientific discovery, enabling the derivation of governing equations from
experimental data. A growing body of work illustrates the promise of
integrating domain knowledge into the SR to improve the discovered equation's
generality and usefulness. Physics-informed SR (PiSR) addresses this by
incorporating domain knowledge, but current methods often require specialized
formulations and manual feature engineering, limiting their adaptability only
to domain experts. In this study, we leverage pre-trained Large Language Models
(LLMs) to facilitate knowledge integration in PiSR. By harnessing the
contextual understanding of LLMs trained on vast scientific literature, we aim
to automate the incorporation of domain knowledge, reducing the need for manual
intervention and making the process more accessible to a broader range of
scientific problems. Namely, the LLM is integrated into the SR's loss function,
adding a term of the LLM's evaluation of the SR's produced equation. We
extensively evaluate our method using three SR algorithms (DEAP, gplearn, and
PySR) and three pre-trained LLMs (Falcon, Mistral, and LLama 2) across three
physical dynamics (dropping ball, simple harmonic motion, and electromagnetic
wave). The results demonstrate that LLM integration consistently improves the
reconstruction of physical dynamics from data, enhancing the robustness of SR
models to noise and complexity. We further explore the impact of prompt
engineering, finding that more informative prompts significantly improve
performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的二进制量化方法，通过动态选择最优子矩阵和适配分组策略，在仅需1.007比特的平均长度下保持了高模型质量，性能超过以往二进制方法并可与4比特量化相竞争。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型需要大量内存和计算资源，二进制量化能大幅度降低存储和推理成本，但传统二进制量化导致显著的性能下降。

Method: 提出了一种专门为二进制量化设计的新题优化目标，以及三种实现该目标的算法。通过动态识别最优的非结构化子矩阵，采用适配性分组策略来改进块量化。

Result: 平均比特长度仅为1.007比特，LLaMA 3.2 3B模型的混淆度从原始的7.81降至8.23，远超以往SOTA BiLLM模型的123.90。压缩效率极高，单CPU核仅需14秒完成全部量化，整体过程不超100分钟。

Conclusion: 该方法在极低的比特长度下实现了近似原始模型的性能，性能超过以往二进制量化方法并可与4比特量化相竞争，为大模型的高效压缩提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, but require
substantial memory and computational resources. Binary quantization, which
compresses model weights from 16-bit Brain Float to 1-bit representations in
{-1, 1}, offers significant reductions in storage and inference costs. However,
such aggressive quantization often leads to notable performance degradation
compared to more conservative 4-bit quantization methods. In this research, we
propose a novel optimization objective tailored for binary quantization, along
with three algorithms designed to realize it effectively. Our method enhances
blocked quantization by dynamically identifying optimal unstructured
sub-matrices through adaptive grouping strategies. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves an average bit length of just 1.007
bits, while maintaining high model quality. Specifically, our quantized LLaMA
3.2 3B model attains a perplexity of 8.23, remarkably close to the original
7.81, and surpasses previous SOTA BiLLM with a perplexity of only 123.90.
Furthermore, our method is competitive with SOTA 4-bit approaches such as GPTQ
in both performance and efficiency. The compression process is highly
efficient, requiring only 14 seconds to quantize the full LLaMA 3.2 3B weights
on a single CPU core, with the entire process completing in under 100 minutes
and exhibiting embarrassingly parallel properties.

Motivation: 为理解深度ReLU网络提供统一的离散几何框架，通过分析激活区域的图结构来理解网络的功能行为和泛化特性

Method: 构建RTG图模型（节点表示线性激活区域，边连接单ReLU激活翻转的区域），理论分析随机初始化的结构特性，并通过小网络实验验证理论预测

Result: 区域熵在过参数化下饱和，谱间隙与泛化相关，相邻区域间的KL散度反映功能平滑性，RTG展现出强扩展性和二项式度分布

Conclusion: 该工作提供了通过离散功能几何分析ReLU网络的统一框架，为理解、诊断和改进泛化提供了新工具

Abstract: We extend the ReLU Transition Graph (RTG) framework into a comprehensive
graph-theoretic model for understanding deep ReLU networks. In this model, each
node represents a linear activation region, and edges connect regions that
differ by a single ReLU activation flip, forming a discrete geometric structure
over the network's functional behavior. We prove that RTGs at random
initialization exhibit strong expansion, binomial degree distributions, and
spectral properties that tightly govern generalization. These structural
insights enable new bounds on capacity via region entropy and on generalization
via spectral gap and edge-wise KL divergence. Empirically, we construct RTGs
for small networks, measure their smoothness and connectivity properties, and
validate theoretical predictions. Our results show that region entropy
saturates under overparameterization, spectral gap correlates with
generalization, and KL divergence across adjacent regions reflects functional
smoothness. This work provides a unified framework for analyzing ReLU networks
through the lens of discrete functional geometry, offering new tools to
understand, diagnose, and improve generalization.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown that their
reasoning capabilities can be significantly improved through Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR), particularly in domains like
mathematics and programming, where ground-truth correctness can be
automatically evaluated. However, extending this success to other
reasoning-intensive domains remains challenging due to the scarcity of
high-quality, verifiable datasets and the high cost of human supervision. In
this work, we introduce the Loong Project: an open-source framework for
scalable synthetic data generation and verification across a diverse range of
reasoning-intensive domains. The framework consists of two key components: (1)
LoongBench, a curated seed dataset containing 8,729 human-vetted examples
across 12 domains (e.g., Advanced Mathematics, Chemistry, Logic), each paired
with executable code and rich metadata; and (2) LoongEnv, a modular synthetic
data generation environment that supports multiple prompting strategies to
produce new question-answer-code triples. Together, these components form an
agent-environment loop that enables reinforcement learning, where an LLM-based
agent is rewarded for generating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) solutions that align
with code-executed answers. Empirically, we benchmark LoongBench on a broad
suite of both open-source and proprietary LLMs to evaluate domain coverage and
reveal performance bottlenecks. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive
analysis of synthetic data generated by LoongEnv, examining correctness,
difficulty, and diversity. Code and documentation are available at

TL;DR: LSAM优化器在保持SAM泛化优势的同时，通过异步分布式采样策略解决了SAM在大批量分布式训练中的效率问题，提供了更好的训练效率和最终精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM)虽然能通过最小化损失和锐度来改善深度神经网络的泛化能力，但在分布式大批量训练中存在效率低下的问题。

Method: LSAM将SAM的对抗步骤与异步分布式采样策略相结合，生成异步分布式采样方案，产生平滑的锐度感知损失景观进行优化。这种设计消除了同步瓶颈。

Result: LSAM加速了大批量收敛，与数据并行SAM相比提供了更高的最终精度。

Conclusion: LSAM是一种新颖的优化器，既保持了SAM的泛化优势，又提供了卓越的效率，特别适用于分布式大批量训练场景。

Abstract: While Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improves generalization in deep
neural networks by minimizing both loss and sharpness, it suffers from
inefficiency in distributed large-batch training. We present Landscape-Smoothed
SAM (LSAM), a novel optimizer that preserves SAM's generalization advantages
while offering superior efficiency. LSAM integrates SAM's adversarial steps
with an asynchronous distributed sampling strategy, generating an asynchronous
distributed sampling scheme, producing a smoothed sharpness-aware loss
landscape for optimization. This design eliminates synchronization bottlenecks,
accelerates large-batch convergence, and delivers higher final accuracy
compared to data-parallel SAM.

Motivation: 解决传统TDCR多核素分析中的自动化程度有限和依赖混合物标准的问题，特别是在标准源不易获得或需要快速现场分析的场景下

Method: 采用Geant4模拟生成β谱数据，结合统计学检测器响应采样，训练特制的神经网络结构，覆盖不同核素混比和氨化情况

Conclusion: 该AI驱动方法具有强大的泛化能力、实时处理能力和工程可行性，特别适用于标准材料缺乏或需要快速现场分析的场合

Abstract: Liquid scintillation triple-to-doubly coincident ratio (TDCR) spectroscopy is
widely adopted as a standard method for radionuclide quantification because of
its inherent advantages such as high precision, self-calibrating capability,
and independence from radioactive reference sources. However, multiradionuclide
analysis via TDCR faces the challenges of limited automation and reliance on
mixture-specific standards, which may not be easily available. Here, we present
an Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework that combines numerical spectral
simulation and deep learning for standard-free automated analysis. $\beta$
spectra for model training were generated using Geant4 simulations coupled with
statistically modeled detector response sampling. A tailored neural network
architecture, trained on this dataset covering various nuclei mix ratio and
quenching scenarios, enables autonomous resolution of individual radionuclide
activities and detecting efficiency through end-to-end learning paradigms. The
model delivers consistent high accuracy across tasks: activity proportions
(mean absolute error = 0.009), detection efficiencies (mean absolute error =
0.002), and spectral reconstruction (Structural Similarity Index = 0.9998),
validating its physical plausibility for quenched $\beta$ spectroscopy. This
AI-driven methodology exhibits significant potential for automated
safety-compliant multiradionuclide analysis with robust generalization,
real-time processing capabilities, and engineering feasibility, particularly in
scenarios where reference materials are unavailable or rapid field analysis is
required.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自动驾驶等安全关键应用中，可解释AI(XAI)的可靠性受到Rashomon效应的挑战——多个同样准确的模型可能对同一预测给出不同的解释。需要量化这种效应的影响。

Method: 使用定性可解释图(QXGs)作为符号场景表示，训练两类模型的Rashomon集合：可解释的基于对的梯度提升模型和复杂的基于图的图神经网络(GNNs)，并通过特征归因方法测量解释的一致性。

Result: 结果显示存在显著的解释分歧，不同模型类别内部和之间的解释一致性都很低。

Conclusion: 解释歧义是动作预测问题的固有属性，而不仅仅是建模伪影，这对安全关键应用中XAI的可靠性提出了重要挑战。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) is essential for validating and trusting models in
safety-critical applications like autonomous driving. However, the reliability
of XAI is challenged by the Rashomon effect, where multiple, equally accurate
models can offer divergent explanations for the same prediction. This paper
provides the first empirical quantification of this effect for the task of
action prediction in real-world driving scenes. Using Qualitative Explainable
Graphs (QXGs) as a symbolic scene representation, we train Rashomon sets of two
distinct model classes: interpretable, pair-based gradient boosting models and
complex, graph-based Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Using feature attribution
methods, we measure the agreement of explanations both within and between these
classes. Our results reveal significant explanation disagreement. Our findings
suggest that explanation ambiguity is an inherent property of the problem, not
just a modeling artifact.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前归因方法评估存在阈值选择偏差，单一阈值选择会逆转方法排名并削弱结论可靠性，需要开发无偏的评估标准。

Method: 提出阈值无关框架，计算交并比曲线下面积(AUC-IoU)，在完整阈值范围内评估归因质量，避免了单一阈值选择的偏差。

Result: 在皮肤镜图像上评估7种归因方法，发现单一阈值指标产生矛盾结果，而无阈值评估提供可靠区分。XRAI比LIME提升31%，比普通积分梯度提升204%，不同病灶尺度的性能差异达269%。

Conclusion: 建立的方法学标准消除了评估伪影，为医学影像及其他领域的归因方法选择提供了理论基础和实践指导，实现了基于证据的方法选择。

Abstract: Attribution methods explain neural network predictions by identifying
influential input features, but their evaluation suffers from threshold
selection bias that can reverse method rankings and undermine conclusions.
Current protocols binarize attribution maps at single thresholds, where
threshold choice alone can alter rankings by over 200 percentage points. We
address this flaw with a threshold-free framework that computes Area Under the
Curve for Intersection over Union (AUC-IoU), capturing attribution quality
across the full threshold spectrum. Evaluating seven attribution methods on
dermatological imaging, we show single-threshold metrics yield contradictory
results, while threshold-free evaluation provides reliable differentiation.
XRAI achieves 31% improvement over LIME and 204% over vanilla Integrated
Gradients, with size-stratified analysis revealing performance variations up to
269% across lesion scales. These findings establish methodological standards
that eliminate evaluation artifacts and enable evidence-based method selection.
The threshold-free framework provides both theoretical insight into attribution
behavior and practical guidance for robust comparison in medical imaging and
beyond.

Motivation: 探索基础模型在地质工程数据分析中的应用潜力，通过TabPFN模型的零训练几射学习能力提升地质参数预测的准确性和效率。

Method: 使用TabPFN基础模型，在不需调参的零训练几射学习设置下，利用间接数据库提供额外上下文信息，解决地质参数预测和缺失值揕充任务。

Result: 在空间剪切强度预测任务中，TabPFN超过传统汇济模型的预测准确性，运行时间缩短了一个数量级；在缺失值揕充任务中，所有目标参数的RMSE均更低且不确定性量化良好，但总计算成本较高。

Conclusion: 这是基础模型在地质工程建模中的首次成功应用，为概率性场地特征化预示了潜在的范式转变。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel application of the Tabular Prior-Data Fitted
Network (TabPFN) - a transformer-based foundation model for tabular data - to
geotechnical site characterization problems defined in the GEOAI benchmark
BM/AirportSoilProperties/2/2025. Two tasks are addressed: (1) predicting the
spatial variation of undrained shear strength (su) across borehole depth
profiles, and (2) imputing missing mechanical parameters in a dense-site
dataset. We apply TabPFN in a zero-training, few-shot, in-context learning
setting - without hyper-parameter tuning - and provide it with additional
context from the big indirect database (BID). The study demonstrates that
TabPFN, as a general-purpose foundation model, achieved superior accuracy and
well-calibrated predictive distributions compared to a conventional
hierarchical Bayesian model (HBM) baseline, while also offering significant
gains in inference efficiency. In Benchmark Problem #1 (spatial su prediction),
TabPFN outperformed the HBM in prediction accuracy and delivered an
order-of-magnitude faster runtime. In Benchmark Problem #2 (missing mechanical
parameter imputation), TabPFN likewise achieved lower RMSE for all target
parameters with well-quantified uncertainties, though its cumulative
computation cost was higher than HBM's due to its one-variable-at-a-time
inference. These results mark the first successful use of a tabular foundation
model in geotechnical modeling, suggesting a potential paradigm shift in
probabilistic site characterization.

Abstract: Decision trees have been studied extensively in the context of fairness,
aiming to maximize prediction performance while ensuring non-discrimination
against different groups. Techniques in this space usually focus on imposing
constraints at training time, constraining the search space so that solutions
which display unacceptable values of relevant metrics are not considered,
discarded, or discouraged. If we assume one target variable y and one sensitive
attribute s, the design space of tree learning algorithms can be spanned as
follows: (i) One can have one tree T that is built using an objective function
that is a function of y, s, and T. For instance, one can build a tree based on
the weighted information gain regarding y (maximizing) and s (minimizing). (ii)
The second option is to have one tree model T that uses an objective function
in y and T and a constraint on s and T. Here, s is no longer part of the
objective, but part of a constraint. This can be achieved greedily by aborting
a further split as soon as the condition that optimizes the objective in y
fails to satisfy the constraint on s. A simple way to explore other splits is
to backtrack during tree construction once a fairness constraint is violated.
(iii) The third option is to have two trees T_y and T_s, one for y and one for
s, such that the tree structure for y and s does not have to be shared. In this
way, information regarding y and regarding s can be used independently, without
having to constrain the choices in tree construction by the mutual information
between the two variables. Quite surprisingly, of the three options, only the
first one and the greedy variant of the second have been studied in the
literature so far. In this paper, we introduce the above two additional options
from that design space and characterize them experimentally on multiple

*Zeqiang Zhang,Fabian Wurzberger,Gerrit Schmid,Sebastian Gottwald,Daniel A. Braun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种将对比学习整合到GCSL框架中的新模型，从成功和失败中学习，克服了自模仿学习的偏差问题，实现了更好的探索性和性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在稀疏奖励任务中面临挑战，GCSL虽然通过目标重标注实现自模仿学习，但存在两个局限：1)仅从自身经验学习会加剧智能体固有偏差；2)只关注成功结果而无法从错误中学习。

Method: 将对比学习原理整合到GCSL框架中，使智能体能够同时从成功和失败的经验中学习，克服初始偏差并促进探索行为。

Result: 通过实证评估表明，该算法克服了智能体初始偏差的限制，实现了更强的探索性，能够识别和采用有效策略，在各种挑战性环境中表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 提出的整合对比学习的GCSL框架有效解决了自模仿学习的局限性，通过从成功和失败中学习，提升了智能体的探索能力和整体性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning faces significant challenges when applied to tasks
characterized by sparse reward structures. Although imitation learning, within
the domain of supervised learning, offers faster convergence, it relies heavily
on human-generated demonstrations. Recently, Goal-Conditioned Supervised
Learning (GCSL) has emerged as a potential solution by enabling self-imitation
learning for autonomous systems. By strategically relabelling goals, agents can
derive policy insights from their own experiences. Despite the successes of
this framework, it presents two notable limitations: (1) Learning exclusively
from self-generated experiences can exacerbate the agents' inherent biases; (2)
The relabelling strategy allows agents to focus solely on successful outcomes,
precluding them from learning from their mistakes. To address these issues, we
propose a novel model that integrates contrastive learning principles into the
GCSL framework to learn from both success and failure. Through empirical
evaluations, we demonstrate that our algorithm overcomes limitations imposed by
agents' initial biases and thereby enables more exploratory behavior. This
facilitates the identification and adoption of effective policies, leading to
superior performance across a variety of challenging environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TeRA是一种新颖的参数高效微调方法，通过张量网络实现高秩权重更新，同时保持向量化方法的参数效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有LoRA风格适配器在高秩表达性和参数效率之间的权衡问题

Method: 使用类Tucker张量网络参数化权重更新矩阵，冻结大型随机初始化因子，仅训练小型层特定缩放向量

Result: TeRA匹配甚至超越高秩适配器性能，同时保持与向量化方法相似的训练参数量

Conclusion: TeRA成功解耦了权重更新矩阵的秩与可训练参数数量，为高效微调提供了新方向

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA), have significantly reduced the number of trainable parameters needed in
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). Subsequent developments of LoRA-style
adapters have diverged into two main directions: (1) enhancing model
expressivity with high-rank adapters, and (2) pushing for further parameter
reduction, as exemplified by vector-based methods. However, these approaches
present a trade-off, as achieving the expressivity of high-rank weight updates
typically comes at the cost of sacrificing the extreme parameter efficiency
offered by vector-based techniques. To address this issue, we propose a
vector-based random \underline{\textbf{Te}}nsor network for
high-\underline{\textbf{R}}ank \underline{\textbf{A}}daptation (TeRA), a novel
PEFT method that achieves high-rank weight updates while retaining the
parameter efficiency of vector-based PEFT adapters. This is achieved by
parameterizing the tensorized weight update matrix as a Tucker-like tensor
network (TN), in which large randomly initialized factors are frozen and shared
across layers, while only small layer-specific scaling vectors, formed by
entries in diagonal factor matrices, are trained. This design effectively
decouples the rank of the weight update matrix from the number of trainable
parameters. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TeRA matches or even
outperforms high-rank adapters, while requiring a trainable parameter count
similar to vector-based methods. Theoretical analysis and ablation studies
further validate the effectiveness of our approach.

*Harald Vilhelm Skat-Rørdam,Sneha Das,Kathrine Sofie Rasmussen,Nicole Nadine Lønfeldt,Line Clemmensen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了窗口化F1指标(F1$_w$)来解决时间序列事件检测评估中的问题，该指标包含时间容差，能够更稳健地评估模型性能，特别是在真实世界不平衡数据集中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在可穿戴设备压力监测等应用中，真实标注通常是单点事件，但实际现象是渐进的、时间上分散的。标准指标如F1和点调整F1(F1$_{pa}$)在这种现实世界不平衡数据集中经常误报模型性能。

Method: 引入窗口化F1指标(F1$_w$)，该指标包含时间容差，允许在精确对齐不现实的情况下进行更稳健的事件检测评估。在三个生理数据集(两个野外数据集ADARP、Wrist Angel和一个实验数据集ROAD)上进行实证分析。

Result: F1$_w$揭示了传统指标无法发现的模型性能模式，其窗口大小可根据领域知识调整以避免高估。使用TimesFM的预测结果显示，只有时间容差指标在野外用例中显示出相对于随机和零基线的统计显著改进。

Conclusion: 这项工作解决了时间序列评估中的关键差距，并为医疗保健应用提供了实用指导，其中时间精度要求因上下文而异。评估指标的选择强烈影响模型性能的解释。

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of event detection in time series is essential for
applications such as stress monitoring with wearable devices, where ground
truth is typically annotated as single-point events, even though the underlying
phenomena are gradual and temporally diffused. Standard metrics like F1 and
point-adjusted F1 (F1$_{pa}$) often misrepresent model performance in such
real-world, imbalanced datasets. We introduce a window-based F1 metric (F1$_w$)
that incorporates temporal tolerance, enabling a more robust assessment of
event detection when exact alignment is unrealistic. Empirical analysis in
three physiological datasets, two in-the-wild (ADARP, Wrist Angel) and one
experimental (ROAD), indicates that F1$_w$ reveals meaningful model performance
patterns invisible to conventional metrics, while its window size can be
adapted to domain knowledge to avoid overestimation. We show that the choice of
evaluation metric strongly influences the interpretation of model performance:
using predictions from TimesFM, only our temporally tolerant metrics reveal
statistically significant improvements over random and null baselines in the
two in-the-wild use cases. This work addresses key gaps in time series
evaluation and provides practical guidance for healthcare applications where
requirements for temporal precision vary by context.

Abstract: The increasing demand for high data rates and seamless connectivity in
wireless systems has sparked significant interest in reconfigurable intelligent
surfaces (RIS) and artificial intelligence-based wireless applications. RIS
typically comprises passive reflective antenna elements that control the
wireless propagation environment by adequately tuning the phase of the
reflective elements. The allocation of RIS elements to multipleuser equipment
(UEs) is crucial for efficiently utilizing RIS. In this work, we formulate a
joint optimization problem that optimizes the RIS phase configuration and
resource allocation under an $\alpha$-fair scheduling framework and propose an
efficient way of allocating RIS elements. Conventional iterative optimization
methods, however, suffer from exponentially increasing computational complexity
as the number of RIS elements increases and also complicate the generation of
training labels for supervised learning. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a five-layer fully connected neural network (FNN) combined with a
preprocessing technique to significantly reduce input dimensionality, lower
computational complexity, and enhance scalability. The simulation results show
that our proposed NN-based solution reduces computational overhead while
significantly improving system throughput by 6.8% compared to existing RIS
element allocation schemes. Furthermore, the proposed system achieves better
performance while reducing computational complexity, making it significantly
more scalable than the iterative optimization algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TopoMap是一种黑盒模型无关的深度学习方法，通过降维和聚类创建输入特征空间的拓扑地图，自动选择最优配置来区分不同故障特征，在突变分析中比随机选择效果提升35-61%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DL测试方法主要关注特定故障特征而忽略其他特征区域，需要一种能够全面映射输入特征空间的方法来系统性地识别和分组导致模型失败的输入特征。

Method: 使用降维技术获取输入嵌入表示，然后进行聚类分析。通过深度神经网络自动评估不同嵌入/聚类配置，选择最优的拓扑地图配置来区分具有不同特征的输入群组。

Result: TopoMap生成的拓扑地图包含可区分且有意义的区域。在突变分析中，对可杀死突变体的选择效果比随机选择平均提升35%，对不可杀死突变体提升61%。

Conclusion: TopoMap提供了一种有效的方法来创建输入特征空间的拓扑地图，能够系统性地识别和分组导致深度学习模型失败的输入特征，显著提高了测试效率。

Abstract: Testing Deep Learning (DL)-based systems is an open challenge. Although it is
relatively easy to find inputs that cause a DL model to misbehave, the grouping
of inputs by features that make the DL model under test fail is largely
unexplored. Existing approaches for DL testing introduce perturbations that may
focus on specific failure-inducing features, while neglecting others that
belong to different regions of the feature space. In this paper, we create an
explicit topographical map of the input feature space. Our approach, named
TopoMap, is both black-box and model-agnostic as it relies solely on features
that characterise the input space. To discriminate the inputs according to the
specific features they share, we first apply dimensionality reduction to obtain
input embeddings, which are then subjected to clustering. Each DL model might
require specific embedding computations and clustering algorithms to achieve a
meaningful separation of inputs into discriminative groups. We propose a novel
way to evaluate alternative configurations of embedding and clustering
techniques. We used a deep neural network (DNN) as an approximation of a human
evaluator who could tell whether a pair of clusters can be discriminated based
on the features of the included elements. We use such a DNN to automatically
select the optimal topographical map of the inputs among all those that are
produced by different embedding/clustering configurations. The evaluation
results show that the maps generated by TopoMap consist of distinguishable and
meaningful regions. In addition, we evaluate the effectiveness of TopoMap using
mutation analysis. In particular, we assess whether the clusters in our
topographical map allow for an effective selection of mutation-killing inputs.
Experimental results show that our approach outperforms random selection by 35%
on average on killable mutants; by 61% on non-killable ones.

Conclusion: FoMEMO通过合成数据预训练的基础模型范式，为昂贵多目标优化提供了高效、通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Expensive multi-objective optimization is a prevalent and crucial concern in
many real-world scenarios, where sample-efficiency is vital due to the limited
evaluations to recover the true Pareto front for decision making. Existing
works either involve rebuilding Gaussian process surrogates from scratch for
each objective in each new problem encountered, or rely on extensive past
domain experiments for pre-training deep learning models, making them hard to
generalize and impractical to cope with various emerging applications in the
real world. To address this issue, we propose a new paradigm named FoMEMO
(Foundation Models for Expensive Multi-objective Optimization), which enables
the establishment of a foundation model conditioned on any domain trajectory
and user preference, and facilitates fast in-context optimization based on the
predicted preference-wise aggregation posteriors. Rather than accessing
extensive domain experiments in the real world, we demonstrate that
pre-training the foundation model with a diverse set of hundreds of millions of
synthetic data can lead to superior adaptability to unknown problems, without
necessitating any subsequent model training or updates in the optimization
process. We evaluate our method across a variety of synthetic benchmarks and
real-word applications, and demonstrate its superior generality and competitive
performance compared to existing methods.

Motivation: 解决表示选择这一基础性问题，开发表示系统无关的技术来驱动表示转换和选择，以增强沟通和推理的有效性。

Result: 开发了一个通用的系统无关演算方法，能够处理形式语言、几何图形、图表以及非正式符号等多种类型的表示系统。

Conclusion: 结构转移提供了一个强大的框架，可以在广泛的实际场景中识别替代表示，促进跨不同表示系统的有效信息转换。

Abstract: Representation choice is of fundamental importance to our ability to
communicate and reason effectively. A major unsolved problem, addressed in this
paper, is how to devise \textit{representational-system (RS) agnostic}
techniques that drive representation transformation and choice. We present a
novel calculus, called \textit{structure transfer}, that enables representation
transformation across diverse RSs. Specifically, given a \textit{source}
representation drawn from a source RS, the rules of structure transfer allow us
to generate a \textit{target} representation for a target RS. The generality of
structure transfer comes in part from its ability to ensure that the source
representation and the generated target representation satisfy \textit{any}
specified relation (such as semantic equivalence). This is done by exploiting
\textit{schemas}, which encode knowledge about RSs. Specifically, schemas can
express \textit{preservation of information} across relations between any pair
of RSs, and this knowledge is used by structure transfer to derive a structure
for the target representation which ensures that the desired relation holds. We
formalise this using Representational Systems Theory~\cite{raggi2022rst},
building on the key concept of a \textit{construction space}. The abstract
nature of construction spaces grants them the generality to model RSs of
diverse kinds, including formal languages, geometric figures and diagrams, as
well as informal notations. Consequently, structure transfer is a
system-agnostic calculus that can be used to identify alternative
representations in a wide range of practical settings.

TL;DR: HyPV-LEAD是一个用于加密货币异常交易早期预警的框架，通过窗口-时间建模、峰谷采样和双曲嵌入技术，在比特币交易数据上实现了0.9624的PR-AUC性能，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加密货币异常交易（如混币服务、欺诈转账、拉盘砸盘）对金融完整性构成日益严重的风险，但由于类别不平衡、时间波动性和复杂网络依赖关系，检测异常交易非常困难。现有方法主要是模型中心化和事后检测，只能在异常发生后标记，预防价值有限。

Method: HyPV-LEAD框架集成了三个创新：(1)窗口-时间建模确保可操作的提前预警时间；(2)峰谷采样缓解类别不平衡同时保持时间连续性；(3)双曲嵌入捕捉区块链交易网络的层次结构和无标度特性。

Result: 在大规模比特币交易数据上的实证评估显示，HyPV-LEAD始终优于最先进的基线方法，实现了0.9624的PR-AUC，在精确率和召回率方面都有显著提升。消融研究证实每个组件都提供互补的益处。

Conclusion: 通过将异常检测从被动分类转变为主动早期预警，HyPV-LEAD为动态区块链环境中的实时风险管理、反洗钱合规和金融安全建立了坚实基础。

Abstract: Abnormal cryptocurrency transactions - such as mixing services, fraudulent
transfers, and pump-and-dump operations -- pose escalating risks to financial
integrity but remain notoriously difficult to detect due to class imbalance,
temporal volatility, and complex network dependencies. Existing approaches are
predominantly model-centric and post hoc, flagging anomalies only after they
occur and thus offering limited preventive value. This paper introduces
HyPV-LEAD (Hyperbolic Peak-Valley Lead-time Enabled Anomaly Detection), a
data-driven early-warning framework that explicitly incorporates lead time into
anomaly detection. Unlike prior methods, HyPV-LEAD integrates three
innovations: (1) window-horizon modeling to guarantee actionable lead-time
alerts, (2) Peak-Valley (PV) sampling to mitigate class imbalance while
preserving temporal continuity, and (3) hyperbolic embedding to capture the
hierarchical and scale-free properties of blockchain transaction networks.
Empirical evaluation on large-scale Bitcoin transaction data demonstrates that
HyPV-LEAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a
PR-AUC of 0.9624 with significant gains in precision and recall. Ablation
studies further confirm that each component - PV sampling, hyperbolic
embedding, and structural-temporal modeling - provides complementary benefits,
with the full framework delivering the highest performance. By shifting anomaly
detection from reactive classification to proactive early-warning, HyPV-LEAD
establishes a robust foundation for real-time risk management, anti-money
laundering (AML) compliance, and financial security in dynamic blockchain
environments.

Abstract: Missing data represents a fundamental challenge in machine learning
applications, often reducing model performance and reliability. This problem is
particularly acute in fields like bioinformatics and clinical machine learning,
where datasets are frequently incomplete due to the nature of both data
generation and data collection. While numerous imputation methods exist, from
simple statistical techniques to advanced deep learning models, no single
method consistently performs well across diverse datasets and missingness
mechanisms. This paper proposes a novel Meta-Imputation approach that learns to
combine the outputs of multiple base imputers to predict missing values more
accurately. By training the proposed method called Meta-Imputation Balanced
(MIB) on synthetically masked data with known ground truth, the system learns
to predict the most suitable imputed value based on the behavior of each
method. Our work highlights the potential of ensemble learning in imputation
and paves the way for more robust, modular, and interpretable preprocessing
pipelines in real-world machine learning systems.

Conclusion: 这项工作通过利用AI进行交通信号控制算法设计，开辟了新的研究方向，将程序合成与交通工程相结合

Abstract: In traffic engineering, the fixed-time traffic signal control remains widely
used for its low cost, stability, and interpretability. However, its design
depends on hand-crafted formulas (e.g., Webster) and manual re-timing by
engineers to adapt to demand changes, which is labor-intensive and often yields
suboptimal results under heterogeneous or congested conditions. This paper
introduces the EvolveSignal, a large language models (LLMs) powered coding
agent to automatically discover new traffic signal control algorithms. We
formulate the problem as program synthesis, where candidate algorithms are
represented as Python functions with fixed input-output structures, and
iteratively optimized through external evaluations (e.g., a traffic simulator)
and evolutionary search. Experiments on a signalized intersection demonstrate
that the discovered algorithms outperform Webster's baseline, reducing average
delay by 20.1% and average stops by 47.1%. Beyond performance, ablation and
incremental analyses reveal that EvolveSignal modifications-such as adjusting
cycle length bounds, incorporating right-turn demand, and rescaling green
allocations-can offer practically meaningful insights for traffic engineers.
This work opens a new research direction by leveraging AI for algorithm design
in traffic signal control, bridging program synthesis with transportation
engineering.

Abstract: Bifurcation phenomena in nonlinear dynamical systems often lead to multiple
coexisting stable solutions, particularly in the presence of symmetry breaking.
Deterministic machine learning models struggle to capture this multiplicity,
averaging over solutions and failing to represent lower-symmetry outcomes. In
this work, we propose a generative framework based on flow matching to model
the full probability distribution over bifurcation outcomes. Our method enables
direct sampling of multiple valid solutions while preserving system symmetries
through equivariant modeling. We introduce a symmetric matching strategy that
aligns predicted and target outputs under group actions, allowing accurate
learning in equivariant settings. We validate our approach on a range of
systems, from toy models to complex physical problems such as buckling beams
and the Allen-Cahn equation. Our results demonstrate that flow matching
significantly outperforms non-probabilistic and variational methods in
capturing multimodal distributions and symmetry-breaking bifurcations, offering
a principled and scalable solution for modeling multistability in
high-dimensional systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然GANs和扩散模型都可以在差分隐私下训练以保护敏感数据，但它们对成员推理攻击（威胁数据机密性的关键攻击）的敏感性仍不清楚，需要系统性的隐私风险分析。

Method: 通过基于稳定性的理论分析比较模型对数据扰动的敏感性，并使用标准化的成员推理攻击流程进行全面的实证研究，评估不同数据集和隐私预算下的隐私泄露情况。

Result: 研究结果显示GANs表现出比扩散模型显著更低的隐私泄露风险，即使在强差分隐私机制下，GANs也展现出明显的隐私鲁棒性优势。

Conclusion: 模型类型本身对隐私泄露具有关键影响，GANs在抵抗成员推理攻击方面具有结构性优势，这为选择隐私保护生成模型提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and diffusion models have emerged as
leading approaches for high-quality image synthesis. While both can be trained
under differential privacy (DP) to protect sensitive data, their sensitivity to
membership inference attacks (MIAs), a key threat to data confidentiality,
remains poorly understood. In this work, we present the first unified
theoretical and empirical analysis of the privacy risks faced by differentially
private generative models. We begin by showing, through a stability-based
analysis, that GANs exhibit fundamentally lower sensitivity to data
perturbations than diffusion models, suggesting a structural advantage in
resisting MIAs. We then validate this insight with a comprehensive empirical
study using a standardized MIA pipeline to evaluate privacy leakage across
datasets and privacy budgets. Our results consistently reveal a marked privacy
robustness gap in favor of GANs, even in strong DP regimes, highlighting that
model type alone can critically shape privacy leakage.

Abstract: Epitopes are short antigenic peptide sequences which are recognized by
antibodies or immune cell receptors. These are central to the development of
immunotherapies, vaccines, and diagnostics. However, the rational design of
synthetic epitope libraries is challenging due to the large combinatorial
sequence space, $20^n$ combinations for linear epitopes of n amino acids,
making screening and testing unfeasible, even with high throughput experimental
techniques. In this study, we present a large language model, epiGPTope,
pre-trained on protein data and specifically fine-tuned on linear epitopes,
which for the first time can directly generate novel epitope-like sequences,
which are found to possess statistical properties analogous to the ones of
known epitopes. This generative approach can be used to prepare libraries of
epitope candidate sequences. We further train statistical classifiers to
predict whether an epitope sequence is of bacterial or viral origin, thus
narrowing the candidate library and increasing the likelihood of identifying
specific epitopes. We propose that such combination of generative and
predictive models can be of assistance in epitope discovery. The approach uses
only primary amino acid sequences of linear epitopes, bypassing the need for a
geometric framework or hand-crafted features of the sequences. By developing a
method to create biologically feasible sequences, we anticipate faster and more
cost-effective generation and screening of synthetic epitopes, with relevant
applications in the development of new biotechnologies.

TL;DR: Fair-Synergy是一个开源的公平资源分配算法框架，通过利用智能体准确性与系统资源之间的凹关系，在多智能体智能系统中实现公平的资源分配，在推理和学习任务中分别比基准方法提升25%和11%的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统资源分配方法忽视了智能体计算能力的多样性和复杂操作环境，导致资源分配效率低下且不公平，需要一种能够确保多智能体智能系统公平资源分配的新方法。

Method: 开发了Fair-Synergy算法框架，扩展传统分配方法以涵盖由模型参数、训练数据量和任务复杂性定义的多维机器学习效用景观，利用智能体准确性与系统资源之间的凹关系进行公平分配。

Result: 在BERT、VGG16、MobileNet、ResNets等先进视觉和语言模型上，使用MNIST、CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、BDD和GLUE数据集进行评估，Fair-Synergy在多智能体推理中比标准基准提升25%，在多智能体学习中提升11%。

Conclusion: Fair-Synergy有效解决了多智能体智能系统中的公平资源分配问题，提供了对最弱势、最优势和平均智能体公平性影响的深入见解，为公平的舰队智能提供了实用框架。

Abstract: Resource allocation is crucial for the performance optimization of
cloud-assisted multi-agent intelligence. Traditional methods often overlook
agents' diverse computational capabilities and complex operating environments,
leading to inefficient and unfair resource distribution. To address this, we
open-sourced Fair-Synergy, an algorithmic framework that utilizes the concave
relationship between the agents' accuracy and the system resources to ensure
fair resource allocation across fleet intelligence. We extend traditional
allocation approaches to encompass a multidimensional machine learning utility
landscape defined by model parameters, training data volume, and task
complexity. We evaluate Fair-Synergy with advanced vision and language models
such as BERT, VGG16, MobileNet, and ResNets on datasets including MNIST,
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, BDD, and GLUE. We demonstrate that Fair-Synergy
outperforms standard benchmarks by up to 25% in multi-agent inference and 11%
in multi-agent learning settings. Also, we explore how the level of fairness
affects the least advantaged, most advantaged, and average agents, providing
insights for equitable fleet intelligence.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究分析61个国家的平均睡眠时长，发现夏令时制实施国家的睡眠时长通常更长，但这种影响受纬度调节：低纬度地区DST国家睡眠更短，高纬度地区更长


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索夏令时制（DST）实施对不同国家睡眠时长的影响，以及纬度在这一关系中的调节作用

Method: 采用61个国家的平均睡眠时长数据，进行统计相关分析，将国家按DST实施情况分组，并通过可视化比较不同组别的睡眠模式

Result: DST实施国家平均睡眠时长更长，但纬度影响显著：低纬度地区DST国家睡眠时长短于非DST国家，高纬度地区则相反

Conclusion: 夏令时制对睡眠的影响受到地理位置的调节，纬度是重要的调节因子

Abstract: In this study we analyzed average sleep durations across 61 countries to
examine the impact of Daylight Saving Time (DST) practices. Key metrics
influencing sleep were identified, and statistical correlation analysis was
applied to explore relationships among these factors. Countries were grouped
based on DST observance, and visualizations compared sleep patterns between DST
and non-DST regions. Results show that, on average, countries observing DST
tend to report longer sleep durations than those that do not. A more detailed
pattern emerged when accounting for latitude: at lower latitudes, DST-observing
countries reported shorter sleep durations compared to non-DST countries, while
at higher latitudes, DST-observing countries reported longer average sleep
durations. These findings suggest that the influence of DST on sleep may be
moderated by geographical location.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文扩展了似然函数校准理论，从二元假设扩展到多元假设情况，使用Aitchison几何和等距对数比变换来推广对数似然比和证据权重的概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然概率预测的校准已被广泛研究，但似然函数的校准研究相对较少，特别是在多元假设情况下缺乏系统理论框架。

Method: 利用Aitchison单纯形几何，将二元情况下的对数似然比(LLR)和证据权重概念扩展到多元假设，提出了等距对数比变换的似然函数。

Result: 建立了多元假设下似然函数校准的理论框架，包括校准定义、幂等性性质和分布约束，并在机器学习中应用非线性判别分析。

Conclusion: 该工作为多元分类问题提供了校准似然函数的理论基础，提高了方法的可解释性和可靠性，主要贡献是概念性扩展。

Abstract: While calibration of probabilistic predictions has been widely studied, this
paper rather addresses calibration of likelihood functions. This has been
discussed, especially in biometrics, in cases with only two exhaustive and
mutually exclusive hypotheses (classes) where likelihood functions can be
written as log-likelihood-ratios (LLRs). After defining calibration for LLRs
and its connection with the concept of weight-of-evidence, we present the
idempotence property and its associated constraint on the distribution of the
LLRs. Although these results have been known for decades, they have been
limited to the binary case. Here, we extend them to cases with more than two
hypotheses by using the Aitchison geometry of the simplex, which allows us to
recover, in a vector form, the additive form of the Bayes' rule; extending
therefore the LLR and the weight-of-evidence to any number of hypotheses.
Especially, we extend the definition of calibration, the idempotence, and the
constraint on the distribution of likelihood functions to this multiple
hypotheses and multiclass counterpart of the LLR: the isometric-log-ratio
transformed likelihood function. This work is mainly conceptual, but we still
provide one application to machine learning by presenting a non-linear
discriminant analysis where the discriminant components form a calibrated
likelihood function over the classes, improving therefore the interpretability
and the reliability of the method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: t-SNE和UMAP等维度降低方法虽然能够进行聚类和嵌入，但容易扭曲数据的全局几何结构，需要更透明的方法来解决这个问题

Method: 提出一种模块化方法：首先对数据进行聚类，然后对每个聚类分别进行嵌入，最后将各聚类对齐以获得全局嵌入

Result: 在多个合成和实际数据集上进行了实验，证明该方法与现有方法相比具有竞争力，同时更加透明

Conclusion: 模块化聚类-嵌入-对齐方法提供了一种更透明的数据可视化方案，能够在保持继耗性的同时减少全局几何扭曲

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction methods such as t-SNE and UMAP are popular methods
for visualizing data with a potential (latent) clustered structure. They are
known to group data points at the same time as they embed them, resulting in
visualizations with well-separated clusters that preserve local information
well. However, t-SNE and UMAP also tend to distort the global geometry of the
underlying data. We propose a more transparent, modular approach consisting of
first clustering the data, then embedding each cluster, and finally aligning
the clusters to obtain a global embedding. We demonstrate this approach on
several synthetic and real-world datasets and show that it is competitive with
existing methods, while being much more transparent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流感治疗中流体和升压药用量决策复杂，以前的自动化强化学习方法依赖关系数据，而图数据表征更能涉及现代医疗数据的复杂性

Method: 将MIMIC-III数据集建模为时间演化的异质图，使用GraphSAGE和GATv2两种图神经网络学习病人状态表征，通过预测下一时刻病人状态的解码器进行聚合训练，然后使用dBCQ算法进行策略学习

Result: 实验评估证明了图基方法的潜力，同时也显示了在这个领域表征学习的复杂性

Conclusion: 图基表征学习方法在流感治疗决策支持中具有潜力，但需要进一步研究复杂的表征学习问题

Abstract: Sepsis is a serious, life-threatening condition. When treating sepsis, it is
challenging to determine the correct amount of intravenous fluids and
vasopressors for a given patient. While automated reinforcement learning
(RL)-based methods have been used to support these decisions with promising
results, previous studies have relied on relational data. Given the complexity
of modern healthcare data, representing data as a graph may provide a more
natural and effective approach. This study models patient data from the
well-known MIMIC-III dataset as a heterogeneous graph that evolves over time.
Subsequently, we explore two Graph Neural Network architectures - GraphSAGE and
GATv2 - for learning patient state representations, adopting the approach of
decoupling representation learning from policy learning. The encoders are
trained to produce latent state representations, jointly with decoders that
predict the next patient state. These representations are then used for policy
learning with the dBCQ algorithm. The results of our experimental evaluation
confirm the potential of a graph-based approach, while highlighting the
complexity of representation learning in this domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR中的结果奖励模型(ORM)过于粗粒度，无法区分正确答案中的错误推理或错误答案中的有效推理，而过程奖励模型(PRM)虽然提供细粒度指导但存在不准确性和奖励攻击问题

Method: 提出PROF方法，通过一致性驱动的样本选择策略，保留具有较高平均过程值的正确响应和具有较低平均过程值的错误响应，同时保持正负训练样本平衡

Result: 实验表明PROF方法相比混合方法持续提高最终准确率超过4%，同时增强了中间推理步骤的质量

Conclusion: PROF有效解决了RLVR中奖励模型的粒度困境，通过协调过程奖励和结果奖励的互补优势，显著提升了数学推理任务的性能

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged to be a
predominant paradigm for mathematical reasoning tasks, offering stable
improvements in reasoning ability. However, Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) in
RLVR are too coarse-grained to distinguish flawed reasoning within correct
answers or valid reasoning within incorrect answers. This lack of granularity
introduces noisy and misleading gradients significantly and hinders further
progress in reasoning process quality. While Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer
fine-grained guidance for intermediate steps, they frequently suffer from
inaccuracies and are susceptible to reward hacking.
  To resolve this dilemma, we introduce PRocess cOnsistency Filter (PROF), an
effective data process curation method that harmonizes noisy, fine-grained
process rewards with accurate, coarse-grained outcome rewards. Rather than
naively blending PRM and ORM in the objective function
(arXiv:archive/2506.18896), PROF leverages their complementary strengths
through consistency-driven sample selection. Our approach retains correct
responses with higher averaged process values and incorrect responses with
lower averaged process values, while maintaining positive/negative training
sample balance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only
consistently improves the final accuracy over $4\%$ compared to the blending
approaches, but also strengthens the quality of intermediate reasoning steps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KANs作为一种新兴的神经网络架构，虽然已在科学和机器学习任务中成功应用，但其初始化策略尚未得到充分研究。本文旨在填补这一空白，为基于样条的KANs开发有效的初始化方案。

Method: 提出了两种理论驱动的初始化方法（LeCun和Glorot启发式）以及一个可调指数的经验性幂律初始化家族。通过函数拟合和前向PDE基准测试的大规模网格搜索、神经正切核视角的训练动态分析，以及Feynman数据集子集的评估来进行验证。

Conclusion: 本文为KANs提供了有效的初始化策略，其中幂律初始化表现出最佳性能，所有代码和数据均已公开提供，有助于推动KANs在实际应用中的发展。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are a recently introduced neural
architecture that replace fixed nonlinearities with trainable activation
functions, offering enhanced flexibility and interpretability. While KANs have
been applied successfully across scientific and machine learning tasks, their
initialization strategies remain largely unexplored. In this work, we study
initialization schemes for spline-based KANs, proposing two theory-driven
approaches inspired by LeCun and Glorot, as well as an empirical power-law
family with tunable exponents. Our evaluation combines large-scale grid
searches on function fitting and forward PDE benchmarks, an analysis of
training dynamics through the lens of the Neural Tangent Kernel, and
evaluations on a subset of the Feynman dataset. Our findings indicate that the
Glorot-inspired initialization significantly outperforms the baseline in
parameter-rich models, while power-law initialization achieves the strongest
performance overall, both across tasks and for architectures of varying size.

TL;DR: LINKER是首个基于序列的模型，仅使用蛋白质序列和配体SMILES就能预测残基-功能基团相互作用类型，无需3D结构输入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法的局限性：需要3D结构输入或使用基于距离的接触标签，限制了应用范围和生物相关性。需要开发仅基于序列就能准确预测生物相关相互作用的方法。

Method: 使用结构监督的注意力机制训练，通过功能基团基模体提取从3D蛋白-配体复合物获得相互作用标签。将配体结构抽象为功能基团，关注化学有意义的子结构。

Result: 在LP-PDBBind基准测试中，基于功能基团抽象的结构监督能够产生与真实生化注释高度一致的相互作用预测。

Conclusion: LINKER仅需序列级输入即可进行大规模应用，在缺乏结构数据的情况下仍能提供准确的生物相关相互作用预测。

Abstract: Accurate identification of interactions between protein residues and ligand
functional groups is essential to understand molecular recognition and guide
rational drug design. Existing deep learning approaches for protein-ligand
interpretability often rely on 3D structural input or use distance-based
contact labels, limiting both their applicability and biological relevance. We
introduce LINKER, the first sequence-based model to predict residue-functional
group interactions in terms of biologically defined interaction types, using
only protein sequences and the ligand SMILES as input. LINKER is trained with
structure-supervised attention, where interaction labels are derived from 3D
protein-ligand complexes via functional group-based motif extraction. By
abstracting ligand structures into functional groups, the model focuses on
chemically meaningful substructures while predicting interaction types rather
than mere spatial proximity. Crucially, LINKER requires only sequence-level
input at inference time, enabling large-scale application in settings where
structural data is unavailable. Experiments on the LP-PDBBind benchmark
demonstrate that structure-informed supervision over functional group
abstractions yields interaction predictions closely aligned with ground-truth
biochemical annotations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DP-SGD在保护用户隐私的同时，量化技术可以大幅减少训练时间、能耗和成本，但研究发现量化在DP-SGD中会导致比普通SGD更严重的精度下降问题。

Method: 提出QPQuant动态量化框架，包含：(1)每轮epoch概率采样选择要量化的层子集；(2)使用差分隐私损失敏感度估计器识别对模型质量影响最小的层进行量化，该估计器仅消耗极少隐私预算。

Result: 在ResNet18、ResNet50和DenseNet121等多个数据集上的实验表明，QPQuant优于静态量化基线，达到接近帕累托最优的精度-计算权衡，在低精度硬件上实现最高2.21倍的理论吞吐量提升，验证精度下降小于2%。

Conclusion: QPQuant有效解决了DP-SGD中量化导致的精度下降问题，通过动态量化策略在保持差分隐私保护的同时显著提升了训练效率。

Abstract: Differentially-Private SGD (DP-SGD) is a powerful technique to protect user
privacy when using sensitive data to train neural networks. During training,
converting model weights and activations into low-precision formats, i.e.,
quantization, can drastically reduce training times, energy consumption, and
cost, and is thus a widely used technique. In this work, we demonstrate that
quantization causes significantly higher accuracy degradation in DP-SGD
compared to regular SGD. We observe that this is caused by noise injection in
DP-SGD, which amplifies quantization variance, leading to disproportionately
large accuracy degradation. To address this challenge, we present QPQuant, a
dynamic quantization framework that adaptively selects a changing subset of
layers to quantize at each epoch. Our method combines two key ideas that
effectively reduce quantization variance: (i) probabilistic sampling of the
layers that rotates which layers are quantized every epoch, and (ii) loss-aware
layer prioritization, which uses a differentially private loss sensitivity
estimator to identify layers that can be quantized with minimal impact on model
quality. This estimator consumes a negligible fraction of the overall privacy
budget, preserving DP guarantees. Empirical evaluations on ResNet18, ResNet50,
and DenseNet121 across a range of datasets demonstrate that DPQuant
consistently outperforms static quantization baselines, achieving near
Pareto-optimal accuracy-compute trade-offs and up to 2.21x theoretical
throughput improvements on low-precision hardware, with less than 2% drop in
validation accuracy.

Conclusion: 该GNN框架能够有效学习液体与动态空间架构体的复杂交互动力学，并支持通过梯度优化方法解决控制和操控任务

Abstract: Simulating particle dynamics with high fidelity is crucial for solving
real-world interaction and control tasks involving liquids in design, graphics,
and robotics. Recently, data-driven approaches, particularly those based on
graph neural networks (GNNs), have shown progress in tackling such problems.
However, these approaches are often limited to learning fluid behavior in
static free-fall environments or simple manipulation settings involving
primitive objects, often overlooking complex interactions with dynamically
moving kinematic rigid bodies. Here, we propose a GNN-based framework designed
from the ground up to learn the dynamics of liquids under rigid body
interactions and active manipulations, where particles are represented as graph
nodes and particle-object collisions are handled using surface representations
with the bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) algorithm. This approach enables the
network to model complex interactions between liquid particles and intricate
surface geometries. Our model accurately captures fluid behavior in dynamic
settings and can also function as a simulator in static free-fall environments.
Despite being trained on a single-object manipulation task of pouring, our
model generalizes effectively to environments with unseen objects and novel
manipulation tasks such as stirring and scooping. Finally, we show that the
learned dynamics can be leveraged to solve control and manipulation tasks using
gradient-based optimization methods.

Conclusion: Robult框架通过轻量级设计实现了可扩展性，能够与现有架构无缝集成，适用于实际多模态应用场景。

Abstract: Addressing missing modalities and limited labeled data is crucial for
advancing robust multimodal learning. We propose Robult, a scalable framework
designed to mitigate these challenges by preserving modality-specific
information and leveraging redundancy through a novel information-theoretic
approach. Robult optimizes two core objectives: (1) a soft Positive-Unlabeled
(PU) contrastive loss that maximizes task-relevant feature alignment while
effectively utilizing limited labeled data in semi-supervised settings, and (2)
a latent reconstruction loss that ensures unique modality-specific information
is retained. These strategies, embedded within a modular design, enhance
performance across various downstream tasks and ensure resilience to incomplete
modalities during inference. Experimental results across diverse datasets
validate that Robult achieves superior performance over existing approaches in
both semi-supervised learning and missing modality contexts. Furthermore, its
lightweight design promotes scalability and seamless integration with existing
architectures, making it suitable for real-world multimodal applications.

Abstract: Proteins play crucial roles in almost all biological processes. The
advancement of deep learning has greatly accelerated the development of protein
foundation models, leading to significant successes in protein understanding
and design. However, the lack of systematic red-teaming for these models has
raised serious concerns about their potential misuse, such as generating
proteins with biological safety risks. This paper introduces SafeProtein, the
first red-teaming framework designed for protein foundation models to the best
of our knowledge. SafeProtein combines multimodal prompt engineering and
heuristic beam search to systematically design red-teaming methods and conduct
tests on protein foundation models. We also curated SafeProtein-Bench, which
includes a manually constructed red-teaming benchmark dataset and a
comprehensive evaluation protocol. SafeProtein achieved continuous jailbreaks
on state-of-the-art protein foundation models (up to 70% attack success rate
for ESM3), revealing potential biological safety risks in current protein
foundation models and providing insights for the development of robust security
protection technologies for frontier models. The codes will be made publicly

TL;DR: 本文证明了Tuning without Forgetting (TwF)方法在非奇异控制下形成的参数子空间是一个有限余维的Banach子流形，并刻画了其切空间，为TwF在顺序训练中保持映射不变性提供了精确的理论基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为先前提出的TwF方法提供严格的理论基础，证明其在顺序训练中能够精确保持先前学习样本的端点映射，而不仅仅是一阶近似意义下的保持。

Method: 通过数学分析证明在非奇异控制条件下，TwF方法形成的参数子空间构成有限余维的Banach子流形，并详细刻画该子流形的切空间结构。

Result: 证明了TwF对应的参数子空间确实是一个Banach子流形，其切空间描述了控制函数沿该子流形切空间的连续变形过程，这为TwF的映射保持特性提供了精确的数学保证。

Conclusion: 该研究为TwF方法建立了坚实的理论框架，表明该方法能够在顺序训练中精确保持先前学习到的映射关系，超越了最初提出时的一阶近似理解，具有重要的理论意义。

Abstract: In our earlier work, we introduced the principle of Tuning without Forgetting
(TwF) for sequential training of neural ODEs, where training samples are added
iteratively and parameters are updated within the subspace of control functions
that preserves the end-point mapping at previously learned samples on the
manifold of output labels in the first-order approximation sense. In this
letter, we prove that this parameter subspace forms a Banach submanifold of
finite codimension under nonsingular controls, and we characterize its tangent
space. This reveals that TwF corresponds to a continuation/deformation of the
control function along the tangent space of this Banach submanifold, providing
a theoretical foundation for its mapping-preserving (not forgetting) during the
sequential training exactly, beyond first-order approximation.

TL;DR: 本文针对LLM-RL训练中传统熵正则化效果不佳的问题，提出了AEnt方法，通过钳位熵奖励和自动调整系数来有效控制策略熵，在数学推理任务中表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统熵正则化方法在机器人控制和游戏RL中有效，但在LLM-RL训练中效果不佳，主要原因是LLM响应空间极大且最优输出稀疏，需要新的熵控制方法。

Method: 提出AEnt方法：1）使用钳位熵奖励，在较小的令牌空间上计算重归一化策略的熵；2）自动调整熵系数，根据钳位熵值动态控制熵诱导偏差。

Conclusion: AEnt方法通过创新的熵控制机制有效解决了LLM-RL训练中的熵正则化问题，为大规模语言模型的强化学习训练提供了有效的熵管理方案。

Abstract: For RL algorithms, appropriate entropy control is crucial to their
effectiveness. To control the policy entropy, a commonly used method is entropy
regularization, which is adopted in various popular RL algorithms including
PPO, SAC and A3C. Although entropy regularization proves effective in robotic
and games RL conventionally, studies found that it gives weak to no gains in
LLM-RL training. In this work, we study the issues of entropy bonus in LLM-RL
setting. Specifically, we first argue that the conventional entropy
regularization suffers from the LLM's extremely large response space and the
sparsity of the optimal outputs. As a remedy, we propose AEnt, an entropy
control method that utilizes a new clamped entropy bonus with an automatically
adjusted coefficient. The clamped entropy is evaluated with the re-normalized
policy defined on certain smaller token space, which encourages exploration
within a more compact response set. In addition, the algorithm automatically
adjusts entropy coefficient according to the clamped entropy value, effectively

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training across numerous edge
devices without requiring participants to share data; however, memory and
communication constraints on these edge devices may preclude their
participation in training. We consider a setting in which a subset of edge
devices are below a critical memory or communication threshold required to
conduct model updates. Under typical federated optimization algorithms, these
devices are excluded from training which renders their data inaccessible and
increases system induced bias. We are inspired by MeZO, a zeroth-order method
used for memory-efficient fine-tuning. The increased variance inherent to
zeroth-order gradient approximations has relegated previous zeroth-order
optimizers exclusively to the domain of fine tuning; a limitation we seek to
correct. We devise a federated, memory-efficient zeroth-order optimizer,
ZOWarmUp that permits zeroth-order training from a random initialization.
ZOWarmUp leverages differing client capabilities and careful variance reduction
techniques to facilitate participation of under-represented, low-resource
clients in model training. Like other federated zeroth-order methods, ZOWarmUp
eliminates the need for edge devices to transmit their full gradients to the
server and instead relies on only a small set of random seeds, rendering the
up-link communication cost negligible. We present experiments using various
datasets and model architectures to show that ZOWarmUp is a robust algorithm
that can can be applied under a wide variety of circumstances. For systems with
a high proportion of edge devices that would otherwise be excluded from
training, this algorithm provides access to a greater volume and diversity of
data, thus improving training outcomes.

Abstract: Accurately obtaining crop type and its spatial distribution at a global scale
is critical for food security, agricultural policy-making, and sustainable
development. Remote sensing offers an efficient solution for large-scale crop
classification, but the limited availability of reliable ground samples in many
regions constrains applicability across geographic areas. To address
performance declines under geospatial shifts, this study identifies remote
sensing features that are invariant to geographic variation and proposes
strategies to enhance cross-regional generalization. We construct CropGlobe, a
global crop type dataset with 300,000 pixel-level samples from eight countries
across five continents, covering six major food and industrial crops (corn,
soybeans, rice, wheat, sugarcane, cotton). With broad geographic coverage,
CropGlobe enables a systematic evaluation under cross-country, cross-continent,
and cross-hemisphere transfer. We compare the transferability of temporal
multi-spectral features (Sentinel-2-based 1D/2D median features and harmonic
coefficients) and hyperspectral features (from EMIT). To improve generalization
under spectral and phenological shifts, we design CropNet, a lightweight and
robust CNN tailored for pixel-level crop classification, coupled with temporal
data augmentation (time shift, time scale, and magnitude warping) that
simulates realistic cross-regional phenology. Experiments show that 2D median
temporal features from Sentinel-2 consistently exhibit the strongest invariance
across all transfer scenarios, and augmentation further improves robustness,
particularly when training data diversity is limited. Overall, the work
identifies more invariant feature representations that enhance geographic
transferability and suggests a promising path toward scalable, low-cost crop
type applications across globally diverse regions.

TL;DR: LimiX是首个大型结构化数据基础模型，通过单一模型处理多种表格任务，在10个基准测试中超越现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实现通用智能需要结合语言、物理世界和结构化数据的基础模型，当前缺乏专门处理结构化数据的统一模型

Method: 将结构化数据视为变量和缺失值的联合分布，使用掩码联合分布建模进行预训练，支持基于查询的条件预测

Result: 在分类、回归、缺失值填补和数据生成等任务中均显著超越梯度提升树、深度表格网络和其他表格基础模型

Conclusion: LimiX证明了单一模型处理多样化表格任务的可行性，为结构化数据基础模型的发展奠定了基础

Abstract: We argue that progress toward general intelligence requires complementary
foundation models grounded in language, the physical world, and structured
data. This report presents LimiX, the first installment of our large
structured-data models (LDMs). LimiX treats structured data as a joint
distribution over variables and missingness, thus capable of addressing a wide
range of tabular tasks through query-based conditional prediction via a single
model. LimiX is pretrained using masked joint-distribution modeling with an
episodic, context-conditional objective, where the model predicts for query
subsets conditioned on dataset-specific contexts, supporting rapid,
training-free adaptation at inference. We evaluate LimiX across 10 large
structured-data benchmarks with broad regimes of sample size, feature
dimensionality, class number, categorical-to-numerical feature ratio,
missingness, and sample-to-feature ratios. With a single model and a unified
interface, LimiX consistently surpasses strong baselines including
gradient-boosting trees, deep tabular networks, recent tabular foundation
models, and automated ensembles, as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. The
superiority holds across a wide range of tasks, such as classification,
regression, missing value imputation, and data generation, often by substantial
margins, while avoiding task-specific architectures or bespoke training per
task. All LimiX models are publicly accessible under Apache 2.0.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
a variety of tasks, but their increasing autonomy in real-world applications
raises concerns about their trustworthiness. While hallucinations-unintentional
falsehoods-have been widely studied, the phenomenon of lying, where an LLM
knowingly generates falsehoods to achieve an ulterior objective, remains
underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the lying behavior
of LLMs, differentiating it from hallucinations and testing it in practical
scenarios. Through mechanistic interpretability techniques, we uncover the
neural mechanisms underlying deception, employing logit lens analysis, causal
interventions, and contrastive activation steering to identify and control
deceptive behavior. We study real-world lying scenarios and introduce
behavioral steering vectors that enable fine-grained manipulation of lying
tendencies. Further, we explore the trade-offs between lying and end-task
performance, establishing a Pareto frontier where dishonesty can enhance goal
optimization. Our findings contribute to the broader discourse on AI ethics,
shedding light on the risks and potential safeguards for deploying LLMs in
high-stakes environments. Code and more illustrations are available at
