### [1] [Teamwork: Collaborative Diffusion with Low-rank Coordination and Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05532)
*Sam Sartor,Pieter Peers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Teamwork是一种灵活统一的解决方案，通过协调多个基础扩散模型实例来扩展输入输出通道，无需改变预训练模型架构，适用于多种图形任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通道扩展方法通常针对特定应用，难以适应不同扩散模型或新任务，需要更灵活的解决方案。

Method: 使用多个基础扩散模型实例作为队友，采用改进的LoRA方法进行联合适应和协调，支持队友动态激活/停用。

Result: 在多种生成和逆向图形任务中表现出灵活性和高效性，包括修复、SVBRDF估计、本征分解、神经着色等。

Conclusion: Teamwork提供了一种无需修改预训练模型架构的统一通道扩展方法，具有很好的适应性和效率。

Abstract: Large pretrained diffusion models can provide strong priors beneficial for
many graphics applications. However, generative applications such as neural
rendering and inverse methods such as SVBRDF estimation and intrinsic image
decomposition require additional input or output channels. Current solutions
for channel expansion are often application specific and these solutions can be
difficult to adapt to different diffusion models or new tasks. This paper
introduces Teamwork: a flexible and efficient unified solution for jointly
increasing the number of input and output channels as well as adapting a
pretrained diffusion model to new tasks. Teamwork achieves channel expansion
without altering the pretrained diffusion model architecture by coordinating
and adapting multiple instances of the base diffusion model (\ie, teammates).
We employ a novel variation of Low Rank-Adaptation (LoRA) to jointly address
both adaptation and coordination between the different teammates. Furthermore
Teamwork supports dynamic (de)activation of teammates. We demonstrate the
flexibility and efficiency of Teamwork on a variety of generative and inverse
graphics tasks such as inpainting, single image SVBRDF estimation, intrinsic
decomposition, neural shading, and intrinsic image synthesis.

### [2] [Attention-Enhanced Prototypical Learning for Few-Shot Infrastructure Defect Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05266)
*Christina Thrainer,Md Meftahul Ferdaus,Mahdi Abdelguerfi,Christian Guetl,Steven Sloan,Kendall N. Niles,Ken Pathak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出增强特征金字塔网络(E-FPN)用于基础设施检查中的少样本语义分割，通过原型学习框架解决标注数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础设施检查应用中标注训练样本稀缺且昂贵，现有深度学习框架需要大量标注数据且难以用少量数据学习新缺陷类别。

Method: 使用自适应E-FPN编码器(InceptionSepConv块和深度可分离卷积)、原型学习(掩码平均池化)和注意力机制(全局/局部自注意力和交叉注意力)。

Result: 在8-way 5-shot训练配置下达到82.55% F1分数和72.26% mIoU，自注意力方法带来2.57% F1分数和2.9% mIoU提升。

Conclusion: 该框架能够用有限的新训练数据快速响应基础设施检查系统中的新缺陷类型，实现更高效经济的维护计划。

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation is vital for deep learning-based
infrastructure inspection applications, where labeled training examples are
scarce and expensive. Although existing deep learning frameworks perform well,
the need for extensive labeled datasets and the inability to learn new defect
categories with little data are problematic. We present our Enhanced Feature
Pyramid Network (E-FPN) framework for few-shot semantic segmentation of culvert
and sewer defect categories using a prototypical learning framework. Our
approach has three main contributions: (1) adaptive E-FPN encoder using
InceptionSepConv blocks and depth-wise separable convolutions for efficient
multi-scale feature extraction; (2) prototypical learning with masked average
pooling for powerful prototype generation from small support examples; and (3)
attention-based feature representation through global self-attention, local
self-attention and cross-attention. Comprehensive experimentation on
challenging infrastructure inspection datasets illustrates that the method
achieves excellent few-shot performance, with the best configuration being
8-way 5-shot training configuration at 82.55% F1-score and 72.26% mIoU in 2-way
classification testing. The self-attention method had the most significant
performance improvements, providing 2.57% F1-score and 2.9% mIoU gain over
baselines. Our framework addresses the critical need to rapidly respond to new
defect types in infrastructure inspection systems with limited new training
data that lead to more efficient and economical maintenance plans for critical
infrastructure systems.

### [3] [SkinMap: Weighted Full-Body Skin Segmentation for Robust Remote Photoplethysmography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05296)
*Zahra Maleki,Amirhossein Akbari,Amirhossein Binesh,Babak Khalaj*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的皮肤分割技术，用于改进远程光电容积描记(rPPG)技术，通过优先选择皮肤区域来增强信号质量，提高在运动、说话等挑战性条件下的心率监测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: rPPG技术对光照和运动敏感，现有方法在皮肤区域选择方面存在不足，需要改进皮肤分割技术来提高信号提取质量。

Method: 开发了新的皮肤分割技术，能够检测全身皮肤区域，同时去除可能造成干扰的口、眼、头发等区域，提高对运动的鲁棒性。

Result: 在公开数据集和新的SYNC-rPPG数据集上评估，模型在说话和头部旋转等挑战性条件下仍能准确捕捉心跳，保持较低的平均绝对误差，并能准确检测多种肤色。

Conclusion: 该技术为现实世界应用提供了有前景的选择，特别是在运动条件下保持心率监测准确性方面表现出色。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is an innovative method for monitoring
heart rate and vital signs by using a simple camera to record a person, as long
as any part of their skin is visible. This low-cost, contactless approach helps
in remote patient monitoring, emotion analysis, smart vehicle utilization, and
more. Over the years, various techniques have been proposed to improve the
accuracy of this technology, especially given its sensitivity to lighting and
movement. In the unsupervised pipeline, it is necessary to first select skin
regions from the video to extract the rPPG signal from the skin color changes.
We introduce a novel skin segmentation technique that prioritizes skin regions
to enhance the quality of the extracted signal. It can detect areas of skin all
over the body, making it more resistant to movement, while removing areas such
as the mouth, eyes, and hair that may cause interference. Our model is
evaluated on publicly available datasets, and we also present a new dataset,
called SYNC-rPPG, to better represent real-world conditions. The results
indicate that our model demonstrates a prior ability to capture heartbeats in
challenging conditions, such as talking and head rotation, and maintain the
mean absolute error (MAE) between predicted and actual heart rates, while other
methods fail to do so. In addition, we demonstrate high accuracy in detecting a
diverse range of skin tones, making this technique a promising option for
real-world applications.

### [4] [DeepAf: One-Shot Spatiospectral Auto-Focus Model for Digital Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05315)
*Yousef Yeganeh,Maximilian Frantzen,Michael Lee,Kun-Hsing Yu,Nassir Navab,Azade Farshad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DeepAf自动对焦框架，结合空间和光谱特征的单次对焦预测方法，可将传统显微镜改造为低成本数字病理扫描仪，对焦时间减少80%，在4倍放大下实现0.90 AUC的癌症分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全玻片扫描仪高成本和现有自动对焦方法在组织形态变化、多图像需求和泛化能力方面的局限性，为资源受限环境提供可访问的数字病理解决方案。

Method: 开发DeepAf混合架构，通过提取空间光谱特征自动回归最优对焦距离，使用单张图像预测对焦点，调整控制参数获得最佳图像质量。

Result: 对焦精度达0.18μm，比堆栈方法减少80%对焦时间，在536个脑组织样本临床研究中实现0.90 AUC的癌症分类准确率，90%预测在景深范围内。

Conclusion: 该系统为资源受限环境提供了保持诊断准确性的实时数字病理解决方案，显著降低了数字病理的可访问门槛。

Abstract: While Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) scanners remain the gold standard for
digitizing pathology samples, their high cost limits accessibility in many
healthcare settings. Other low-cost solutions also face critical limitations:
automated microscopes struggle with consistent focus across varying tissue
morphology, traditional auto-focus methods require time-consuming focal stacks,
and existing deep-learning approaches either need multiple input images or lack
generalization capability across tissue types and staining protocols. We
introduce a novel automated microscopic system powered by DeepAf, a novel
auto-focus framework that uniquely combines spatial and spectral features
through a hybrid architecture for single-shot focus prediction. The proposed
network automatically regresses the distance to the optimal focal point using
the extracted spatiospectral features and adjusts the control parameters for
optimal image outcomes. Our system transforms conventional microscopes into
efficient slide scanners, reducing focusing time by 80% compared to stack-based
methods while achieving focus accuracy of 0.18 {\mu}m on the same-lab samples,
matching the performance of dual-image methods (0.19 {\mu}m) with half the
input requirements. DeepAf demonstrates robust cross-lab generalization with
only 0.72% false focus predictions and 90% of predictions within the depth of
field. Through an extensive clinical study of 536 brain tissue samples, our
system achieves 0.90 AUC in cancer classification at 4x magnification, a
significant achievement at lower magnification than typical 20x WSI scans. This
results in a comprehensive hardware-software design enabling accessible,
real-time digital pathology in resource-constrained settings while maintaining
diagnostic accuracy.

best results, achieving 99.33% accuracy with consistently strong metrics for
individual classes, particularly excelling in identifying Cutting Weevil and
Bacterial Canker. Moreover, ResNet152V2 and SeResNet152 provided strong
outcomes, whereas InceptionV3 and Xception exhibited lower performance in
visually similar categories like Sooty Mould and Powdery Mildew. The training
and validation plots demonstrated stable convergence for the highest-performing
models. The capability of fine-tuned transfer learning models, for precise and
dependable multi-class mango leaf disease detection in intelligent agricultural
applications.

### [6] [Mitigating Diffusion Model Hallucinations with Dynamic Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05356)
*Kostas Triaridis,Alexandros Graikos,Aggelina Chatziagapi,Grigorios G. Chrysos,Dimitris Samaras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了动态引导方法，在生成时选择性锐化导致伪影方向的分数函数，减少扩散模型的结构不一致幻觉，同时保持语义变化多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型经常产生结构不一致的幻觉样本，这些样本超出了真实数据分布的支撑。这种幻觉可归因于数据分布模式之间的过度平滑，但语义插值对生成多样性很重要，因此需要更细致的解决方案。

Method: 引入动态引导方法，通过仅沿已知导致伪影的预定方向选择性锐化分数函数来减轻幻觉，同时保留有效的语义变化。

Result: 动态引导在受控和自然图像数据集上都显著减少了幻觉，明显优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 这是第一个在生成时而非通过后处理过滤来解决幻觉的方法，动态引导能有效减少扩散模型的幻觉问题。

Abstract: Diffusion models, despite their impressive demos, often produce hallucinatory
samples with structural inconsistencies that lie outside of the support of the
true data distribution. Such hallucinations can be attributed to excessive
smoothing between modes of the data distribution. However, semantic
interpolations are often desirable and can lead to generation diversity, thus
we believe a more nuanced solution is required. In this work, we introduce
Dynamic Guidance, which tackles this issue. Dynamic Guidance mitigates
hallucinations by selectively sharpening the score function only along the
pre-determined directions known to cause artifacts, while preserving valid
semantic variations. To our knowledge, this is the first approach that
addresses hallucinations at generation time rather than through post-hoc
filtering. Dynamic Guidance substantially reduces hallucinations on both
controlled and natural image datasets, significantly outperforming baselines.

### [7] [LightCache: Memory-Efficient, Training-Free Acceleration for Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05367)
*Yang Xiao,Gen Li,Kaiyuan Deng,Yushu Wu,Zheng Zhan,Yanzhi Wang,Xiaolong Ma,Bo Hui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种训练免费的视频生成加速方法LightCache，通过分析扩散模型推理过程中的编码、去噪和解码阶段，设计了阶段特定的内存优化策略，在保持质量的同时实现更快的推理速度和更低的内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于缓存的加速方法在去噪和解码阶段会导致显著的内存激增，需要解决扩散模型推理过程中的内存瓶颈问题。

Method: 1) 异步缓存交换 2) 特征分块 3) 切片潜在变量解码，针对不同推理阶段设计专门的内存优化策略。

Result: 与基线相比，实现了更快的推理速度和更低的内存使用，同时将质量下降控制在可接受范围内。

Conclusion: LightCache方法有效解决了视频生成扩散模型推理中的内存瓶颈问题，在保持质量的同时显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Training-free acceleration has emerged as an advanced research area in video
generation based on diffusion models. The redundancy of latents in diffusion
model inference provides a natural entry point for acceleration. In this paper,
we decompose the inference process into the encoding, denoising, and decoding
stages, and observe that cache-based acceleration methods often lead to
substantial memory surges in the latter two stages. To address this problem, we
analyze the characteristics of inference across different stages and propose
stage-specific strategies for reducing memory consumption: 1) Asynchronous
Cache Swapping. 2) Feature chunk. 3) Slicing latents to decode. At the same
time, we ensure that the time overhead introduced by these three strategies
remains lower than the acceleration gains themselves. Compared with the
baseline, our approach achieves faster inference speed and lower memory usage,
while maintaining quality degradation within an acceptable range. The Code is
available at https://github.com/NKUShaw/LightCache .

### [8] [See the past: Time-Reversed Scene Reconstruction from Thermal Traces Using Visual Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05408)
*Kebin Contreras,Luis Toscano-Palomino,Mauro Dalla Mura,Jorge Bacca*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于热成像和RGB图像的时间反演重建框架，利用视觉语言模型和约束扩散过程从热痕迹中恢复几秒前的场景状态


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热成像能捕捉人机交互留下的热痕迹，这些痕迹作为被动时间编码，可以推断近期事件，超越RGB相机的限制

Method: 使用配对的RGB和热图像，结合视觉语言模型生成场景描述并指导图像重建，通过约束扩散过程确保语义和结构一致性

Result: 在三个受控场景中评估，能够重建120秒前的合理过去帧，为基于热痕迹的时间反演成像提供了初步验证

Conclusion: 该方法展示了从热痕迹中恢复过去场景状态的可行性，是时间反演成像领域的重要进展

Abstract: Recovering the past from present observations is an intriguing challenge with
potential applications in forensics and scene analysis. Thermal imaging,
operating in the infrared range, provides access to otherwise invisible
information. Since humans are typically warmer (37 C -98.6 F) than their
surroundings, interactions such as sitting, touching, or leaning leave residual
heat traces. These fading imprints serve as passive temporal codes, allowing
for the inference of recent events that exceed the capabilities of RGB cameras.
This work proposes a time-reversed reconstruction framework that uses paired
RGB and thermal images to recover scene states from a few seconds earlier. The
proposed approach couples Visual-Language Models (VLMs) with a constrained
diffusion process, where one VLM generates scene descriptions and another
guides image reconstruction, ensuring semantic and structural consistency. The
method is evaluated in three controlled scenarios, demonstrating the
feasibility of reconstructing plausible past frames up to 120 seconds earlier,
providing a first step toward time-reversed imaging from thermal traces.

### [9] [Personalizing Retrieval using Joint Embeddings or "the Return of Fluffy"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05411)
*Bruno Korbar,Andrew Zisserman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为pi-map的可训练映射网络，能够将对象实例的图像嵌入转换为文本标记，结合自然语言查询实现个性化图像检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标是实现结合对象实例图像信息和自然语言描述的复合查询图像检索，例如检索"某人头上的独角兽Fluffy"这样的图像。

Method: 设计映射网络将局部图像嵌入转换为文本标记，结合自然语言查询进行CLIP风格文本编码和图像检索。每个对象实例只需训练一次映射网络。

Result: 使用可训练的pi-map映射网络配合冻结的CLIP文本和图像编码器，在两个个性化检索基准测试中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效实现结合对象实例和自然语言描述的复合查询图像检索，在个性化检索任务上表现优异。

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to be able to retrieve images using a compound
query that combines object instance information from an image, with a natural
text description of what that object is doing or where it is. For example, to
retrieve an image of "Fluffy the unicorn (specified by an image) on someone's
head". To achieve this we design a mapping network that can "translate" from a
local image embedding (of the object instance) to a text token, such that the
combination of the token and a natural language query is suitable for CLIP
style text encoding, and image retrieval. Generating a text token in this
manner involves a simple training procedure, that only needs to be performed
once for each object instance. We show that our approach of using a trainable
mapping network, termed pi-map, together with frozen CLIP text and image
encoders, improves the state of the art on two benchmarks designed to assess
personalized retrieval.

### [10] [ArchitectHead: Continuous Level of Detail Control for 3D Gaussian Head Avatars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05488)
*Peizhi Yan,Rabab Ward,Qiang Tang,Shan Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArchitectHead是首个支持连续控制细节级别的3D高斯头部化身框架，通过UV特征场和动态重采样实现渲染效率与视觉质量的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS化身的高斯点数量固定，无法灵活调整细节级别来平衡渲染效率与视觉质量，限制了实际应用。

Method: 在2D UV特征空间中参数化高斯点，构建多级可学习特征图组成的UV特征场，通过轻量级神经网络解码器将潜在特征转换为3D高斯属性，通过动态重采样特征图控制高斯点数量。

Result: 在最高细节级别实现SOTA质量，最低细节级别仅使用6.2%的高斯点，质量适度下降(L1损失+7.9%等)，渲染速度几乎翻倍。

Conclusion: ArchitectHead实现了无需重新训练的连续细节级别控制，在保持高质量的同时显著提升渲染效率。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled photorealistic and real-time
rendering of 3D head avatars. Existing 3DGS-based avatars typically rely on
tens of thousands of 3D Gaussian points (Gaussians), with the number of
Gaussians fixed after training. However, many practical applications require
adjustable levels of detail (LOD) to balance rendering efficiency and visual
quality. In this work, we propose "ArchitectHead", the first framework for
creating 3D Gaussian head avatars that support continuous control over LOD. Our
key idea is to parameterize the Gaussians in a 2D UV feature space and propose
a UV feature field composed of multi-level learnable feature maps to encode
their latent features. A lightweight neural network-based decoder then
transforms these latent features into 3D Gaussian attributes for rendering.
ArchitectHead controls the number of Gaussians by dynamically resampling
feature maps from the UV feature field at the desired resolutions. This method
enables efficient and continuous control of LOD without retraining.
Experimental results show that ArchitectHead achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
quality in self and cross-identity reenactment tasks at the highest LOD, while
maintaining near SOTA performance at lower LODs. At the lowest LOD, our method
uses only 6.2\% of the Gaussians while the quality degrades moderately (L1 Loss
+7.9\%, PSNR --0.97\%, SSIM --0.6\%, LPIPS Loss +24.1\%), and the rendering
speed nearly doubles.

### [11] [Human Action Recognition from Point Clouds over Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05506)
*James Dickens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于3D点云视频的动作识别新方法，结合点云技术和稀疏卷积网络，在NTU RGB-D 120数据集上达到89.3%的准确率，优于之前的点云动作识别方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着消费级深度传感器和激光雷达的普及，有机会利用密集3D数据进行动作识别，作为骨骼动作识别和视频方法的第三种途径。

Method: 构建了一个从3D视频中分割人体点云、跟踪个体并进行身体部位分割的流程，核心是结合点基技术和稀疏卷积网络的3D动作识别骨干网络，使用体素映射的点云序列。

Result: 在NTU RGB-D 120数据集上表现优异，当训练和测试使用不同人体时，结合传感器和估计深度输入的集成方法达到89.3%的准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法在3D动作识别方面具有竞争力，能够有效利用点云数据，为动作识别提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: Recent research into human action recognition (HAR) has focused predominantly
on skeletal action recognition and video-based methods. With the increasing
availability of consumer-grade depth sensors and Lidar instruments, there is a
growing opportunity to leverage dense 3D data for action recognition, to
develop a third way. This paper presents a novel approach for recognizing
actions from 3D videos by introducing a pipeline that segments human point
clouds from the background of a scene, tracks individuals over time, and
performs body part segmentation. The method supports point clouds from both
depth sensors and monocular depth estimation. At the core of the proposed HAR
framework is a novel backbone for 3D action recognition, which combines
point-based techniques with sparse convolutional networks applied to
voxel-mapped point cloud sequences. Experiments incorporate auxiliary point
features including surface normals, color, infrared intensity, and body part
parsing labels, to enhance recognition accuracy. Evaluation on the NTU RGB- D
120 dataset demonstrates that the method is competitive with existing skeletal
action recognition algorithms. Moreover, combining both sensor-based and
estimated depth inputs in an ensemble setup, this approach achieves 89.3%
accuracy when different human subjects are considered for training and testing,
outperforming previous point cloud action recognition methods.

### [12] [Be Tangential to Manifold: Discovering Riemannian Metric for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05509)
*Shinnosuke Saito,Takashi Matsubara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的黎曼度量方法，用于在扩散模型的噪声空间中生成更符合数据流形的插值路径，相比现有方法能产生更自然和忠实的过渡效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型缺乏显式的低维潜在空间来参数化数据流形，这限制了流形感知的分析和操作。现有的插值方法通常沿着高密度区域路径，这些路径不一定与数据流形对齐，可能导致感知上不自然的过渡。

Method: 基于分数函数雅可比矩阵捕捉局部数据流形切空间的发现，在噪声空间中提出了一种新的黎曼度量，鼓励噪声空间中的测地线保持在或平行于学习到的数据流形。

Result: 在图像插值实验中，该方法比现有的基于密度的方法和朴素基线产生了感知上更自然和忠实的过渡效果。

Conclusion: 所提出的黎曼度量方法能够更好地利用扩散模型学习到的数据流形，为扩散模型提供了更有效的流形感知操作能力。

Abstract: Diffusion models are powerful deep generative models (DGMs) that generate
high-fidelity, diverse content. However, unlike classical DGMs, they lack an
explicit, tractable low-dimensional latent space that parameterizes the data
manifold. This absence limits manifold-aware analysis and operations, such as
interpolation and editing. Existing interpolation methods for diffusion models
typically follow paths through high-density regions, which are not necessarily
aligned with the data manifold and can yield perceptually unnatural
transitions. To exploit the data manifold learned by diffusion models, we
propose a novel Riemannian metric on the noise space, inspired by recent
findings that the Jacobian of the score function captures the tangent spaces to
the local data manifold. This metric encourages geodesics in the noise space to
stay within or run parallel to the learned data manifold. Experiments on image
interpolation show that our metric produces perceptually more natural and
faithful transitions than existing density-based and naive baselines.

*Owen Henkel,Bill Roberts,Doug Jaffe,Laurence Holt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 多模态大语言模型在手写数学作业评分中表现良好，但在分析数学图示方面仍有困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多模态大语言模型在小学数学教育中自动评分、分析和反馈手写作业的潜力，以减轻教师负担。

Method: 进行两个实验：实验A评估288份加纳中学生手写算术作业的客观答案评分；实验B评估150份美国小学生数学图示的主观评分，并比较直接评分与基于人工描述的评分效果。

Result: 实验A中模型达到接近人类水平的准确率（95%，k=0.90）；实验B中直接评分表现差（k=0.20），但基于人工描述后显著改善（k=0.47），达到人类间一致水平。

Conclusion: MLLM能较好识别和解释算术作业，但在视觉理解和分析学生数学图示方面仍存在挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) raise the
question of their potential for grading, analyzing, and offering feedback on
handwritten student classwork. This capability would be particularly beneficial
in elementary and middle-school mathematics education, where most work remains
handwritten, because seeing students' full working of a problem provides
valuable insights into their learning processes, but is extremely
time-consuming to grade. We present two experiments investigating MLLM
performance on handwritten student mathematics classwork. Experiment A examines
288 handwritten responses from Ghanaian middle school students solving
arithmetic problems with objective answers. In this context, models achieved
near-human accuracy (95%, k = 0.90) but exhibited occasional errors that human
educators would be unlikely to make. Experiment B evaluates 150 mathematical
illustrations from American elementary students, where the drawings are the
answer to the question. These tasks lack single objective answers and require
sophisticated visual interpretation as well as pedagogical judgment in order to
analyze and evaluate them. We attempted to separate MLLMs' visual capabilities
from their pedagogical abilities by first asking them to grade the student
illustrations directly, and then by augmenting the image with a detailed human
description of the illustration. We found that when the models had to analyze
the student illustrations directly, they struggled, achieving only k = 0.20
with ground truth scores, but when given human descriptions, their agreement
levels improved dramatically to k = 0.47, which was in line with human-to-human
agreement levels. This gap suggests MLLMs can "see" and interpret arithmetic
work relatively well, but still struggle to "see" student mathematical
illustrations.

Abstract: Object recognition and motion understanding are key components of perception
that complement each other. While self-supervised learning methods have shown
promise in their ability to learn from unlabeled data, they have primarily
focused on obtaining rich representations for either recognition or motion
rather than both in tandem. On the other hand, latent dynamics modeling has
been used in decision making to learn latent representations of observations
and their transformations over time for control and planning tasks. In this
work, we present Midway Network, a new self-supervised learning architecture
that is the first to learn strong visual representations for both object
recognition and motion understanding solely from natural videos, by extending
latent dynamics modeling to this domain. Midway Network leverages a midway
top-down path to infer motion latents between video frames, as well as a dense
forward prediction objective and hierarchical structure to tackle the complex,
multi-object scenes of natural videos. We demonstrate that after pretraining on
two large-scale natural video datasets, Midway Network achieves strong
performance on both semantic segmentation and optical flow tasks relative to
prior self-supervised learning methods. We also show that Midway Network's
learned dynamics can capture high-level correspondence via a novel analysis
method based on forward feature perturbation.

TL;DR: HoloScene是一个新颖的交互式3D重建框架，通过统一的能量优化方法同时实现几何完整性、物体交互性、物理合理性和真实感渲染，为AR/VR、游戏和机器人等领域创建高质量的数字孪生。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D重建和场景理解方法在几何完整性、物体交互性、物理合理性、真实感渲染或可靠动态模拟等方面存在不足，需要一种能同时满足这些要求的综合解决方案。

Method: 采用基于能量的优化问题框架，结合观测数据、物理约束和生成先验，使用采样探索与梯度优化的混合方法，构建包含几何、外观、物理属性和层次关系的交互式场景图表示。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现出优越性能，生成的数字孪生具有完整精确的几何结构、物理稳定性和新颖视角下的真实感渲染效果。

Conclusion: HoloScene通过统一的优化框架成功解决了3D重建中的多个关键挑战，在交互游戏和实时数字孪生操作等实际应用中展示了广泛的适用性和有效性。

Abstract: Digitizing the physical world into accurate simulation-ready virtual
environments offers significant opportunities in a variety of fields such as
augmented and virtual reality, gaming, and robotics. However, current 3D
reconstruction and scene-understanding methods commonly fall short in one or
more critical aspects, such as geometry completeness, object interactivity,
physical plausibility, photorealistic rendering, or realistic physical
properties for reliable dynamic simulation. To address these limitations, we
introduce HoloScene, a novel interactive 3D reconstruction framework that
simultaneously achieves these requirements. HoloScene leverages a comprehensive
interactive scene-graph representation, encoding object geometry, appearance,
and physical properties alongside hierarchical and inter-object relationships.
Reconstruction is formulated as an energy-based optimization problem,
integrating observational data, physical constraints, and generative priors
into a unified, coherent objective. Optimization is efficiently performed via a
hybrid approach combining sampling-based exploration with gradient-based
refinement. The resulting digital twins exhibit complete and precise geometry,
physical stability, and realistic rendering from novel viewpoints. Evaluations
conducted on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance,
while practical use-cases in interactive gaming and real-time digital-twin
manipulation illustrate HoloScene's broad applicability and effectiveness.

TL;DR: CalibCLIP是一种无需训练的方法，通过校准主导令牌的抑制效应来改进视觉语言模型在文本驱动图像检索任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型存在结构限制，少数低贡献令牌可能过度捕获全局语义，主导信息聚合过程并抑制判别性特征。

Method: 在视觉空间提出对比视觉增强器(CVE)，将视觉特征解耦为目标和低信息区域，识别主导令牌并动态抑制其表示；在文本空间提出判别概念校准器(DCC)，区分文本查询中的通用和判别概念。

Result: 在涵盖三个图像检索任务的七个基准测试中均取得一致改进。

Conclusion: CalibCLIP通过校准主导令牌的抑制效应，有效提升了文本驱动图像检索的性能。

Abstract: Existing Visual Language Models (VLMs) suffer structural limitations where a
few low contribution tokens may excessively capture global semantics,
dominating the information aggregation process and suppressing the
discriminative features in text-driven image retrieval tasks. To address this,
we introduce \textbf{CalibCLIP}, a training-free method designed to calibrate
the suppressive effect of dominant tokens. Specifically, in the visual space,
we propose the Contrastive Visual Enhancer (CVE), which decouples visual
features into target and low information regions. Subsequently, it identifies
dominant tokens and dynamically suppresses their representations.In the textual
space, we introduce the Discriminative Concept Calibrator (DCC), which aims to
differentiate between general and discriminative concepts within the text
query. By mitigating the challenges posed by generic concepts and improving the
representations of discriminative concepts, DCC strengthens the differentiation
among similar samples. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate consistent
improvements across seven benchmarks spanning three image retrieval tasks,
underscoring the effectiveness of CalibCLIP. Code is available at:

TL;DR: ShortCoTI是一个轻量级优化框架，通过强化学习减少视觉思维链的冗余，在保持图像质量的同时将提示推理长度减少54%，提高计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型使用思维链推理来增强图像生成的细节对齐，但这会导致视觉过度思考现象，产生不必要的冗余，增加计算成本并可能引入与原始提示矛盾的细节。

Method: 提出ShortCoTI框架，使用自适应奖励函数根据任务难度鼓励更简洁的思维链，并将其整合到强化学习范式中。

Result: 在多个基准测试(T2I-CompBench, GenEval)上，将提示推理长度减少54%，同时保持或略微提高质量指标。定性分析显示消除了冗长解释和重复优化。

Conclusion: ShortCoTI在不影响生成图像保真度或视觉吸引力的前提下提高了计算效率，产生了既简洁又语义丰富的推理提示。

Abstract: Autoregressive multimodal large language models have recently gained
popularity for image generation, driven by advances in foundation models. To
enhance alignment and detail, newer approaches employ chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning, expanding user inputs into elaborated prompts prior to image
synthesis. However, this strategy can introduce unnecessary redundancy -- a
phenomenon we call visual overthinking -- which increases computational costs
and can introduce details that contradict the original prompt. In this work, we
explore how to generate more concise CoT sequences for more efficient image
generation. We introduce ShortCoTI, a lightweight optimization framework that
encourages more concise CoT while preserving output image quality. ShortCoTI
rewards more concise prompts with an adaptive function that scales according to
an estimated difficulty for each task. Incorporating this reward into a
reinforcement learning paradigm reduces prompt reasoning length by 54% while
maintaining or slightly improving quality metrics across multiple benchmarks
(T2I-CompBench, GenEval). Qualitative analysis shows that our method eliminates
verbose explanations and repetitive refinements, producing reasoning prompts
that are both concise and semantically rich. As a result, ShortCoTI improves
computational efficiency without compromising the fidelity or visual appeal of
generated images.

TL;DR: 提出HOI-R1方法，首次探索纯语言模型在人体-物体交互检测任务中的潜力，无需额外检测模块，通过强化学习实现2倍基线准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HOID方法依赖VLMs先验知识，框架复杂且训练策略困难，而MLLMs在HOID任务中的推理能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 引入HOI推理过程和HOID奖励函数，通过纯文本方式解决HOID任务，利用强化学习训练MLLMs。

Result: 在HICO-DET数据集上，HOI-R1达到基线方法2倍的准确率，并具有出色的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 证明了纯语言模型在HOID任务中的可行性，为简化复杂检测框架提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent Human-object interaction detection (HOID) methods highly require prior
knowledge from VLMs to enhance the interaction recognition capabilities. The
training strategies and model architectures for connecting the knowledge from
VLMs to the HOI instance representations from the object detector are
challenging, and the whole framework is complex for further development or
application. On the other hand, the inherent reasoning abilities of MLLMs on
human-object interaction detection are under-explored. Inspired by the recent
success of training MLLMs with reinforcement learning (RL) methods, we propose
HOI-R1 and first explore the potential of the language model on the HOID task
without any additional detection modules. We introduce an HOI reasoning process
and HOID reward functions to solve the HOID task by pure text. The results on
the HICO-DET dataset show that HOI-R1 achieves 2x the accuracy of the baseline
with great generalization ability. The source code is available at

Motivation: 当前自回归模型在复杂空间条件生成时需要微调预训练模型，导致高昂的训练成本，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 使用轻量级控制模块，包含上下文感知注意力层和共享门控前馈网络，并引入早期中心采样策略和温度调度机制。

Conclusion: ECM框架在保持高质量生成的同时，显著提高了训练和推理效率，为自回归模型的复杂条件生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in autoregressive (AR) models have demonstrated their
potential to rival diffusion models in image synthesis. However, for complex
spatially-conditioned generation, current AR approaches rely on fine-tuning the
pre-trained model, leading to significant training costs. In this paper, we
propose the Efficient Control Model (ECM), a plug-and-play framework featuring
a lightweight control module that introduces control signals via a distributed
architecture. This architecture consists of context-aware attention layers that
refine conditional features using real-time generated tokens, and a shared
gated feed-forward network (FFN) designed to maximize the utilization of its
limited capacity and ensure coherent control feature learning. Furthermore,
recognizing the critical role of early-stage generation in determining semantic
structure, we introduce an early-centric sampling strategy that prioritizes
learning early control sequences. This approach reduces computational cost by
lowering the number of training tokens per iteration, while a complementary
temperature scheduling during inference compensates for the resulting
insufficient training of late-stage tokens. Extensive experiments on
scale-based AR models validate that our method achieves high-fidelity and
diverse control over image generation, surpassing existing baselines while
significantly improving both training and inference efficiency.

TL;DR: PointNSP是一个从粗到细的自回归点云生成框架，通过多尺度分解解决了传统自回归方法在无序点集上强加人工排序的问题，在生成质量上首次超越了扩散方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归点云生成方法由于在无序点集上强加人工排序，导致模型难以捕捉长程依赖关系，无法有效保持全局结构特性如对称性、一致拓扑和大尺度几何规律。

Method: 提出PointNSP框架，基于形状建模中的细节层次原则，在低分辨率下保持全局形状结构，通过下一尺度预测范式逐步细化高尺度下的精细几何。

Result: 在ShapeNet上的实验表明，PointNSP首次在自回归范式中实现了最先进的生成质量，并且在参数、训练和推理效率上超越了强扩散基线方法。

Conclusion: PointNSP通过多尺度分解使自回归目标与点集的置换不变性对齐，在8192点的高密度生成中优势更加明显，展示了其可扩展性潜力。

Abstract: Autoregressive point cloud generation has long lagged behind diffusion-based
approaches in quality. The performance gap stems from the fact that
autoregressive models impose an artificial ordering on inherently unordered
point sets, forcing shape generation to proceed as a sequence of local
predictions. This sequential bias emphasizes short-range continuity but
undermines the model's capacity to capture long-range dependencies, hindering
its ability to enforce global structural properties such as symmetry,
consistent topology, and large-scale geometric regularities. Inspired by the
level-of-detail (LOD) principle in shape modeling, we propose PointNSP, a
coarse-to-fine generative framework that preserves global shape structure at
low resolutions and progressively refines fine-grained geometry at higher
scales through a next-scale prediction paradigm. This multi-scale factorization
aligns the autoregressive objective with the permutation-invariant nature of
point sets, enabling rich intra-scale interactions while avoiding brittle fixed
orderings. Experiments on ShapeNet show that PointNSP establishes
state-of-the-art (SOTA) generation quality for the first time within the
autoregressive paradigm. In addition, it surpasses strong diffusion-based
baselines in parameter, training, and inference efficiency. Finally, in dense
generation with 8,192 points, PointNSP's advantages become even more
pronounced, underscoring its scalability potential.

Abstract: Tear film break-up (TFBU) analysis is critical for diagnosing dry eye
syndrome, but automated TFBU segmentation remains challenging due to the lack
of annotated datasets and integrated solutions. This paper introduces the Tear
Film Multi-task (TFM) Dataset, the first comprehensive dataset for multi-task
tear film analysis, comprising 15 high-resolution videos (totaling 6,247
frames) annotated with three vision tasks: frame-level classification ('clear',
'closed', 'broken', 'blur'), Placido Ring detection, and pixel-wise TFBU area
segmentation. Leveraging this dataset, we first propose TF-Net, a novel and
efficient baseline segmentation model. TF-Net incorporates a MobileOne-mini
backbone with re-parameterization techniques and an enhanced feature pyramid
network to achieve a favorable balance between accuracy and computational
efficiency for real-time clinical applications. We further establish benchmark
performance on the TFM segmentation subset by comparing TF-Net against several
state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models. Furthermore, we design
TF-Collab, a novel integrated real-time pipeline that synergistically leverages
models trained on all three tasks of the TFM dataset. By sequentially
orchestrating frame classification for BUT determination, pupil region
localization for input standardization, and TFBU segmentation, TF-Collab fully
automates the analysis. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed TF-Net and TF-Collab, providing a foundation for future research
in ocular surface diagnostics. Our code and the TFM datasets are available at

TL;DR: InstaGeo是一个端到端的地理空间AI框架，通过自动化数据管道和模型蒸馏技术，将大型地理空间基础模型转化为紧凑高效的实用工具，实现从原始卫星图像到模型部署的快速流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有地理空间基础模型(GFMs)存在两大限制：(1)缺乏自动化地理空间数据处理流程，(2)微调后的模型仍然过于庞大，阻碍了实际部署应用。

Method: InstaGeo集成三个核心组件：(1)自动化数据整理，将原始卫星图像转化为模型就绪数据集；(2)任务特定模型蒸馏，生成紧凑高效的小型模型；(3)无缝部署为交互式网络地图应用。

Result: 在三个应用场景中复现了已发表研究：洪水测绘(-0.73pp mIoU差异)、作物分割(-0.20pp)、沙漠蝗虫预测(+1.79pp)。蒸馏模型比标准微调模型小8倍，显著减少计算量和碳排放。在更大作物分割数据集上达到60.65% mIoU，比之前基线提升12pp。

Conclusion: InstaGeo通过统一数据准备、模型压缩和部署流程，将研究级地理空间基础模型转化为实用的低碳工具，推动地理空间AI向数据质量和应用驱动创新转变。

Abstract: Open-access multispectral imagery from missions like Landsat 8-9 and
Sentinel-2 has fueled the development of geospatial foundation models (GFMs)
for humanitarian and environmental applications. Yet, their deployment remains
limited by (i) the absence of automated geospatial data pipelines and (ii) the
large size of fine-tuned models. Existing GFMs lack workflows for processing
raw satellite imagery, and downstream adaptations often retain the full
complexity of the original encoder.
  We present InstaGeo, an open-source, end-to-end framework that addresses
these challenges by integrating: (1) automated data curation to transform raw
imagery into model-ready datasets; (2) task-specific model distillation to
derive compact, compute-efficient models; and (3) seamless deployment as
interactive web-map applications. Using InstaGeo, we reproduced datasets from
three published studies and trained models with marginal mIoU differences of
-0.73 pp for flood mapping, -0.20 pp for crop segmentation, and +1.79 pp for
desert locust prediction. The distilled models are up to 8x smaller than
standard fine-tuned counterparts, reducing FLOPs and CO2 emissions with minimal
accuracy loss.
  Leveraging InstaGeo's streamlined data pipeline, we also curated a larger
crop segmentation dataset, achieving a state-of-the-art mIoU of 60.65%, a 12 pp
improvement over prior baselines. Moreover, InstaGeo enables users to progress
from raw data to model deployment within a single working day.
  By unifying data preparation, model compression, and deployment, InstaGeo
transforms research-grade GFMs into practical, low-carbon tools for real-time,
large-scale Earth observation. This approach shifts geospatial AI toward data
quality and application-driven innovation. Source code, datasets, and model

Result: 研究发现大多数检测器并不从根本上依赖频谱峰值，挑战了该领域的普遍假设。

Conclusion: 这项工作为开发更透明可靠的取证工具铺平了道路，强调了检测器可解释性的重要性。

Abstract: Over the years, the forensics community has proposed several deep
learning-based detectors to mitigate the risks of generative AI. Recently,
frequency-domain artifacts (particularly periodic peaks in the magnitude
spectrum), have received significant attention, as they have been often
considered a strong indicator of synthetic image generation. However,
state-of-the-art detectors are typically used as black-boxes, and it still
remains unclear whether they truly rely on these peaks. This limits their
interpretability and trust. In this work, we conduct a systematic study to
address this question. We propose a strategy to remove spectral peaks from
images and analyze the impact of this operation on several detectors. In
addition, we introduce a simple linear detector that relies exclusively on
frequency peaks, providing a fully interpretable baseline free from the
confounding influence of deep learning. Our findings reveal that most detectors
are not fundamentally dependent on spectral peaks, challenging a widespread
assumption in the field and paving the way for more transparent and reliable
forensic tools.

Motivation: 双曲空间能表示更丰富的结构（如树结构），但双曲空间中的监督代理损失尚未被报道。代理损失在大规模数据集上具有较低的训练复杂度，因此很有吸引力。

Method: 提出CHEST损失函数，由双曲空间和欧几里得空间的代理损失以及基于双曲层次聚类的正则化损失组成。

Result: 双曲空间和欧几里得空间的组合提高了DML的准确性和学习稳定性，在四个基准数据集上实现了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: CHEST损失通过结合双曲和欧几里得空间的代理损失，解决了双曲空间中应用代理损失的挑战，提高了深度度量学习的性能。

Abstract: Deep metric learning (DML) aims to learn a neural network mapping data to an
embedding space, which can represent semantic similarity between data points.
Hyperbolic space is attractive for DML since it can represent richer
structures, such as tree structures. DML in hyperbolic space is based on
pair-based loss or unsupervised regularization loss. On the other hand,
supervised proxy-based losses in hyperbolic space have not been reported yet
due to some issues in applying proxy-based losses in a hyperbolic space.
However, proxy-based losses are attractive for large-scale datasets since they
have less training complexity. To address these, this paper proposes the
Combined Hyperbolic and Euclidean Soft Triple (CHEST) loss. CHEST loss is
composed of the proxy-based losses in hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces and the
regularization loss based on hyperbolic hierarchical clustering. We find that
the combination of hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces improves DML accuracy and
learning stability for both spaces. Finally, we evaluate the CHEST loss on four
benchmark datasets, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了两个深度学习框架：AHP-CADNet用于眼源性异常头位自动诊断，以及基于课程学习的插补框架处理缺失数据，在PoseGaze-AHP数据集上取得了优异的诊断性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 眼源性异常头位(AHP)是斜视等眼部错位引起的代偿机制，早期诊断可减少并发症，但当前临床评估主要依赖主观判断且受不完整医疗记录影响。

Method: 开发了两个互补框架：1) AHP-CADNet多级注意力融合框架，整合眼部标志点、头部姿态特征和结构化临床属性；2) 课程学习插补框架，逐步利用结构化和非结构化临床数据填补缺失值。

Result: AHP-CADNet在分类任务中准确率达96.9-99.0%，连续变量预测MAE为0.103-0.199，R²超过0.93。插补框架在所有临床变量上保持高准确率(93.46-99.78%)，临床依赖建模显著改善性能(p < 0.001)。

Conclusion: 两个框架在临床环境中对自动诊断和缺失数据恢复均表现出有效性，为AHP的客观评估提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Ocular-induced abnormal head posture (AHP) is a compensatory mechanism that
arises from ocular misalignment conditions, such as strabismus, enabling
patients to reduce diplopia and preserve binocular vision. Early diagnosis
minimizes morbidity and secondary complications such as facial asymmetry;
however, current clinical assessments remain largely subjective and are further
complicated by incomplete medical records. This study addresses both challenges
through two complementary deep learning frameworks. First, AHP-CADNet is a
multi-level attention fusion framework for automated diagnosis that integrates
ocular landmarks, head pose features, and structured clinical attributes to
generate interpretable predictions. Second, a curriculum learning-based
imputation framework is designed to mitigate missing data by progressively
leveraging structured variables and unstructured clinical notes to enhance
diagnostic robustness under realistic data conditions. Evaluation on the
PoseGaze-AHP dataset demonstrates robust diagnostic performance. AHP-CADNet
achieves 96.9-99.0 percent accuracy across classification tasks and low
prediction errors for continuous variables, with MAE ranging from 0.103 to
0.199 and R2 exceeding 0.93. The imputation framework maintains high accuracy
across all clinical variables (93.46-99.78 percent with PubMedBERT), with
clinical dependency modeling yielding significant improvements (p < 0.001).
These findings confirm the effectiveness of both frameworks for automated
diagnosis and recovery from missing data in clinical settings.

Conclusion: EduVerse在真实性、可复现性和可解释性之间取得平衡，为教育AI提供了可扩展平台，将开源以促进跨学科研究。

Abstract: Reproducing cognitive development, group interaction, and long-term evolution
in virtual classrooms remains a core challenge for educational AI, as real
classrooms integrate open-ended cognition, dynamic social interaction,
affective factors, and multi-session development rarely captured together.
Existing approaches mostly focus on short-term or single-agent settings,
limiting systematic study of classroom complexity and cross-task reuse. We
present EduVerse, the first user-defined multi-agent simulation space that
supports environment, agent, and session customization. A distinctive
human-in-the-loop interface further allows real users to join the space. Built
on a layered CIE (Cognition-Interaction-Evolution) architecture, EduVerse
ensures individual consistency, authentic interaction, and longitudinal
adaptation in cognition, emotion, and behavior-reproducing realistic classroom
dynamics with seamless human-agent integration. We validate EduVerse in
middle-school Chinese classes across three text genres, environments, and
multiple sessions. Results show: (1) Instructional alignment: simulated IRF
rates (0.28-0.64) closely match real classrooms (0.37-0.49), indicating
pedagogical realism; (2) Group interaction and role differentiation: network
density (0.27-0.40) with about one-third of peer links realized, while
human-agent tasks indicate a balance between individual variability and
instructional stability; (3) Cross-session evolution: the positive transition
rate R+ increase by 11.7% on average, capturing longitudinal shifts in
behavior, emotion, and cognition and revealing structured learning
trajectories. Overall, EduVerse balances realism, reproducibility, and
interpretability, providing a scalable platform for educational AI. The system
will be open-sourced to foster cross-disciplinary research.

Result: 实验证明SD-MVSum在脚本驱动和通用视频摘要任务中具有竞争力，优于现有SOTA方法。

Conclusion: 同时考虑视觉和语音内容的多模态方法能显著提升脚本驱动视频摘要的性能，扩展的数据集为多模态视频摘要研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: In this work, we extend a recent method for script-driven video
summarization, originally considering just the visual content of the video, to
take into account the relevance of the user-provided script also with the
video's spoken content. In the proposed method, SD-MVSum, the dependence
between each considered pair of data modalities, i.e., script-video and
script-transcript, is modeled using a new weighted cross-modal attention
mechanism. This explicitly exploits the semantic similarity between the paired
modalities in order to promote the parts of the full-length video with the
highest relevance to the user-provided script. Furthermore, we extend two
large-scale datasets for video summarization (S-VideoXum, MrHiSum), to make
them suitable for training and evaluation of script-driven multimodal video
summarization methods. Experimental comparisons document the competitiveness of
our SD-MVSum method against other SOTA approaches for script-driven and generic
video summarization. Our new method and extended datasets are available at:

TL;DR: ARGUS提出了一种用于肝癌组织学分型的新方法，通过捕获肿瘤微环境中的宏观-中观-微观层次信息，融合几何特征和层次视野对齐，在肝癌亚型分类中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肝癌是消化系统中最具异质性和预后多样性的癌症，HCC和ICC两种主要组织学亚型在组织形态和细胞结构上比其他常见肿瘤更复杂。现有方法未能充分利用WSI中的层次金字塔结构、肿瘤微环境和几何表示等关键信息，导致对组织学表示的理解有限和分型性能不佳。

Method: ARGUS方法包括：1) 构建微几何特征来表示细胞水平的细粒度模式；2) 设计层次视野对齐模块来建模WSI中固有的宏观和中观层次交互；3) 通过几何先验引导融合策略将增强的微几何和视野特征融合为联合表示。

Result: 在公共和私有队列上的广泛实验表明，ARGUS在肝癌组织学分型中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ARGUS为临床实践中的原发性肝癌提供了有效的诊断工具，通过捕获肿瘤微环境中的多层次信息显著提升了肝癌亚型分类性能。

Abstract: Primary liver malignancies are widely recognized as the most heterogeneous
and prognostically diverse cancers of the digestive system. Among these,
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) emerge
as the two principal histological subtypes, demonstrating significantly greater
complexity in tissue morphology and cellular architecture than other common
tumors. The intricate representation of features in Whole Slide Images (WSIs)
encompasses abundant crucial information for liver cancer histological
subtyping, regarding hierarchical pyramid structure, tumor microenvironment
(TME), and geometric representation. However, recent approaches have not
adequately exploited these indispensable effective descriptors, resulting in a
limited understanding of histological representation and suboptimal subtyping
performance. To mitigate these limitations, ARGUS is proposed to advance
histological subtyping in liver cancer by capturing the macro-meso-micro
hierarchical information within the TME. Specifically, we first construct a
micro-geometry feature to represent fine-grained cell-level pattern via a
geometric structure across nuclei, thereby providing a more refined and precise
perspective for delineating pathological images. Then, a Hierarchical
Field-of-Views (FoVs) Alignment module is designed to model macro- and
meso-level hierarchical interactions inherent in WSIs. Finally, the augmented
micro-geometry and FoVs features are fused into a joint representation via
present Geometry Prior Guided Fusion strategy for modeling holistic phenotype
interactions. Extensive experiments on public and private cohorts demonstrate
that our ARGUS achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in histological
subtyping of liver cancer, which provide an effective diagnostic tool for
primary liver malignancies in clinical practice.

*Jialu Gao,K J Joseph,Fernando De La Torre*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练的管道，利用预训练扩散模型将人物从参考图像无缝插入背景场景，实现真实的人类场景合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将人物定位和个性化视为独立问题，忽视了它们之间的相互联系，且依赖训练才能获得高性能。

Method: 结合反转技术和无分类器引导实现可感知的全局编辑，并提出掩码引导的自注意力机制来保证高质量个性化。

Result: 在多样化合成场景图像中实现了最先进的结果，在背景和主体身份保持方面表现出色。

Conclusion: 扩散模型本身具备将人物放置在复杂场景中的知识，无需特定任务训练即可实现真实的人类插入。

Abstract: The task of realistically inserting a human from a reference image into a
background scene is highly challenging, requiring the model to (1) determine
the correct location and poses of the person and (2) perform high-quality
personalization conditioned on the background. Previous approaches often treat
them as separate problems, overlooking their interconnections, and typically
rely on training to achieve high performance. In this work, we introduce a
unified training-free pipeline that leverages pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models. We show that diffusion models inherently possess the
knowledge to place people in complex scenes without requiring task-specific
training. By combining inversion techniques with classifier-free guidance, our
method achieves affordance-aware global editing, seamlessly inserting people
into scenes. Furthermore, our proposed mask-guided self-attention mechanism
ensures high-quality personalization, preserving the subject's identity,
clothing, and body features from just a single reference image. To the best of
our knowledge, we are the first to perform realistic human insertions into
scenes in a training-free manner and achieve state-of-the-art results in
diverse composite scene images with excellent identity preservation in
backgrounds and subjects.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态架构来自动编辑古典音乐会的多摄像头录制视频，解决了"何时剪辑"和"如何剪辑"两个关键子任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化视频编辑在计算机视觉和多媒体领域仍是一个探索不足的任务，特别是与视频生成和场景理解相比。本文专注于古典音乐会多摄像头录制的编辑挑战。

Method: 将问题分解为两个子任务：时间分割（何时剪辑）使用轻量级卷积-Transformer管道集成音频log-mel频谱图、可选图像嵌入和标量时间特征；空间选择（如何剪辑）使用CLIP编码器替换旧骨干网络，并将干扰项选择限制在同一音乐会的片段中。

Result: 模型在检测剪辑点方面优于先前基线，在视觉镜头选择方面具有竞争力，推进了多模态自动化视频编辑的技术水平。

Conclusion: 该方法通过改进的时间分割和空间选择策略，在自动化视频编辑任务中取得了先进性能，为多摄像头音乐会录制提供了有效的编辑解决方案。

Abstract: Automated video editing remains an underexplored task in the computer vision
and multimedia domains, especially when contrasted with the growing interest in
video generation and scene understanding. In this work, we address the specific
challenge of editing multicamera recordings of classical music concerts by
decomposing the problem into two key sub-tasks: when to cut and how to cut.
Building on recent literature, we propose a novel multimodal architecture for
the temporal segmentation task (when to cut), which integrates log-mel
spectrograms from the audio signals, plus an optional image embedding, and
scalar temporal features through a lightweight convolutional-transformer
pipeline. For the spatial selection task (how to cut), we improve the
literature by updating from old backbones, e.g. ResNet, with a CLIP-based
encoder and constraining distractor selection to segments from the same
concert. Our dataset was constructed following a pseudo-labeling approach, in
which raw video data was automatically clustered into coherent shot segments.
We show that our models outperformed previous baselines in detecting cut points
and provide competitive visual shot selection, advancing the state of the art
in multimodal automated video editing.

TL;DR: 开发了一种结合形态和空间特征的图像分析流水线，通过时间整合方法在复杂条件下准确识别和量化生菜幼苗，验证了低成本成像系统与先进计算工具结合进行表型分析的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究立枯丝核菌(R. solani)接种对生菜种子萌发和早期发育的影响，需要一种能够在复杂生长条件下准确监测的方法，传统图像分析在叶片重叠时效果不佳。

Method: 使用低成本多摄像头系统连续捕获萌发过程图像，开发了整合形态和空间特征的新型图像分析流水线，关键创新是时间整合方法，考虑当前状态和先前时间点的发展轨迹。

Result: 该方法在幼苗计数和活力评估方面表现出高准确性，即使在密集交织生长条件下也能准确识别，R²达到0.98，RMSE为1.12。R. solani感染显著降低了萌发率和早期幼苗活力。

Conclusion: 证明了低成本成像硬件与先进计算工具结合进行非破坏性、可扩展表型数据获取的可行性，时间整合方法在传统分割技术失效的复杂条件下特别有效。

Abstract: The study investigates the effects of R. solani inoculation on the
germination and early development of Lactuca sativa L. seeds using a low-cost,
image-based monitoring system. Multiple cameras were deployed to continuously
capture images of the germination process in both infected and control groups.
The objective was to assess the impact of the pathogen by analyzing germination
dynamics and growth over time. To achieve this, a novel image analysis pipeline
was developed. The algorithm integrates both morphological and spatial features
to identify and quantify individual seedlings, even under complex conditions
where traditional image analyses fails. A key innovation of the method lies in
its temporal integration: each analysis step considers not only the current
status but also their developmental across prior time points. This approach
enables robust discrimination of individual seedlings, especially when
overlapping leaves significantly hinder object separation. The method
demonstrated high accuracy in seedling counting and vigor assessment, even in
challenging scenarios characterized by dense and intertwined growth. Results
confirm that R. solani infection significantly reduces germination rates and
early seedling vigor. The study also validates the feasibility of combining
low-cost imaging hardware with advanced computational tools to obtain
phenotyping data in a non-destructive and scalable manner. The temporal
integration enabled accurate quantification of germinated seeds and precise
determination of seedling emergence timing. This approach proved particularly
effective in later stages of the experiment, where conventional segmentation
techniques failed due to overlapping or intertwined seedlings, making accurate
counting. The method achieved a coefficient of determination of 0.98 and a root
mean square error (RMSE) of 1.12, demonstrating its robustness and reliability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于对象级别的视觉表示学习方法，通过将视觉对象视为视觉等价于语言中的单词，来提升视觉模型的语义理解和推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉模型在推理和上下文学习能力方面落后于语言模型，这可能源于视觉变换器训练方案中缺乏语义和上下文指导。

Method: 采用掩码图像建模框架，将掩码应用于视觉对象而非随机图像块，迫使模型学习视觉元素之间的全局上下文和语义关系。

Result: 定性和定量评估表明，对象级表示有助于学习真实世界分布，而像素平均捷径在没有对象级表示时往往被学习。在多模态大语言模型的视觉问答任务上表现出强大的推理和上下文理解能力。

Conclusion: 对象级编码是开发更强视觉编码器和分词器的有效方向，能够显著提升视觉模型的语义理解和推理能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in language modeling have witnessed the rise of highly
desirable emergent capabilities, such as reasoning and in-context learning.
However, vision models have yet to exhibit comparable progress in these areas.
In this paper, we argue that this gap could stem from the lack of semantic and
contextual guidance in current vision transformer (ViT) training schemes, and
such a gap can be narrowed through the design of a semantic-grounded objective.
Specifically, we notice that individual words in natural language are
inherently semantic, and modeling directly on word tokens naturally learns a
realistic distribution. In contrast, ViTs rely on spatial patchification, which
inevitably lacks semantic information. To bridge this gap, we propose to
directly model "object" as the visual equivalence of "word," pushing the model
to learn the global context and semantics among visual elements. We investigate
our hypotheses via masked image modeling (MIM), a framework where our approach
can be readily tested by applying masks to visual objects rather than random
patches. Considerable evidence from qualitative and quantitative evaluations
reveals a key finding: object-level representation alone helps to learn a
real-world distribution, whereas pixel-averaging shortcuts are often learned
without it. Moreover, further evaluations with multimodal LLMs (MLLM) on visual
question answering (VQA, GQA, ScienceQA) tasks demonstrate the strong reasoning
and contextual understanding gained with this simple objective. We hope our
study highlights the effectiveness of object-level encoding and provides a
plausible direction for developing stronger vision encoders and tokenizers.
Code and model will be publicly released. Keywords: Semantic Visual Tokenizer,

TL;DR: AgeBooth是一种新颖的年龄特定微调方法，无需昂贵的年龄变化数据集即可增强基于适配器的身份个性化模型的年龄控制能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散模型在从参考照片生成身份一致图像时，难以准确控制年龄同时保持身份，且微调此类模型通常需要跨年龄的昂贵配对图像。

Method: 通过利用衰老的线性特性，引入年龄条件提示混合和基于SVDMix矩阵融合技术的年龄特定LoRA融合策略，减少对大量年龄标记数据的依赖。

Result: AgeBooth能够从单张参考图像生成不同年龄段的逼真且身份一致的人脸图像，在年龄控制和视觉质量方面优于先前最先进的基于编辑的方法。

Conclusion: AgeBooth提供了一种有效的年龄控制解决方案，无需昂贵的年龄变化数据集，实现了高质量的中介年龄肖像生成。

Abstract: Recent diffusion model research focuses on generating identity-consistent
images from a reference photo, but they struggle to accurately control age
while preserving identity, and fine-tuning such models often requires costly
paired images across ages. In this paper, we propose AgeBooth, a novel
age-specific finetuning approach that can effectively enhance the age control
capability of adapterbased identity personalization models without the need for
expensive age-varied datasets. To reduce dependence on a large amount of
age-labeled data, we exploit the linear nature of aging by introducing
age-conditioned prompt blending and an age-specific LoRA fusion strategy that
leverages SVDMix, a matrix fusion technique. These techniques enable
high-quality generation of intermediate-age portraits. Our AgeBooth produces
realistic and identity-consistent face images across different ages from a
single reference image. Experiments show that AgeBooth achieves superior age
control and visual quality compared to previous state-of-the-art editing-based
methods.

Conclusion: 该方法无需人工标注，显著提升下游任务性能，为数据增强提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Generating enough and diverse data through augmentation offers an efficient
solution to the time-consuming and labour-intensive process of collecting and
annotating pixel-wise images. Traditional data augmentation techniques often
face challenges in manipulating high-level semantic attributes, such as
materials and textures. In contrast, diffusion models offer a robust
alternative, by effectively utilizing text-to-image or image-to-image
transformation. However, existing diffusion-based methods are either
computationally expensive or compromise on performance. To address this issue,
we introduce a novel training-free pipeline that integrates pretrained
ControlNet and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to generate synthetic images
paired with pixel-level labels. This approach eliminates the need for manual
annotations and significantly improves downstream tasks. To improve the
fidelity and diversity, we add a Multi-way Prompt Generator, Mask Generator and
High-quality Image Selection module. Our results on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i
present promising performance and outperform concurrent work for one-shot
semantic segmentation.

Motivation: 开发不依赖深度传感器的SLAM系统，利用现代预训练视觉模型作为可靠的实时度量尺度来源，实现更简单、成本更低的SLAM解决方案。

Method: 使用三个预训练视觉模块：单目度量深度估计器、学习关键点检测器和实例分割网络。通过膨胀实例掩码抑制动态物体，将静态关键点分配预测深度值并反投影到3D形成度量尺度特征，由未修改的RGB-D SLAM后端处理。

Result: 在TUM RGB-D基准测试中，静态序列平均ATE为7.4cm，动态序列为1.8cm，达到或超过最先进的RGB-D方法性能，在单个GPU上以22FPS实时运行。

Conclusion: 现代预训练视觉模型可以替代主动深度传感器作为可靠的实时度量尺度来源，标志着向更简单、更具成本效益的SLAM系统迈出了一步。

Abstract: We present DropD-SLAM, a real-time monocular SLAM system that achieves
RGB-D-level accuracy without relying on depth sensors. The system replaces
active depth input with three pretrained vision modules: a monocular metric
depth estimator, a learned keypoint detector, and an instance segmentation
network. Dynamic objects are suppressed using dilated instance masks, while
static keypoints are assigned predicted depth values and backprojected into 3D
to form metrically scaled features. These are processed by an unmodified RGB-D
SLAM back end for tracking and mapping. On the TUM RGB-D benchmark, DropD-SLAM
attains 7.4 cm mean ATE on static sequences and 1.8 cm on dynamic sequences,
matching or surpassing state-of-the-art RGB-D methods while operating at 22 FPS
on a single GPU. These results suggest that modern pretrained vision models can
replace active depth sensors as reliable, real-time sources of metric scale,
marking a step toward simpler and more cost-effective SLAM systems.

Motivation: 现有合成图像检测研究主要关注跨生成器泛化，但忽略了跨视觉域泛化的同等重要性。为了填补这一空白，需要开发更全面的评估方法和检测器。

Method: 提出了FusionDetect方法，利用CLIP和Dinov2两个冻结基础模型提取互补特征，构建能够适应生成器内容和设计变化的统一特征空间。

Result: FusionDetect在现有基准测试中比最接近的竞争对手准确率高3.87%，平均精度高6.13%；在OmniGen基准上准确率提高4.48%，并对常见图像扰动具有出色的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 本文不仅提出了性能最佳的检测器，还建立了新的基准和框架，为通用AI图像检测的进一步发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: The rapid development of generative models has made it increasingly crucial
to develop detectors that can reliably detect synthetic images. Although most
of the work has now focused on cross-generator generalization, we argue that
this viewpoint is too limited. Detecting synthetic images involves another
equally important challenge: generalization across visual domains. To bridge
this gap,we present the OmniGen Benchmark. This comprehensive evaluation
dataset incorporates 12 state-of-the-art generators, providing a more realistic
way of evaluating detector performance under realistic conditions. In addition,
we introduce a new method, FusionDetect, aimed at addressing both vectors of
generalization. FusionDetect draws on the benefits of two frozen foundation
models: CLIP & Dinov2. By deriving features from both complementary models,we
develop a cohesive feature space that naturally adapts to changes in both
thecontent and design of the generator. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that FusionDetect delivers not only a new state-of-the-art, which is 3.87% more
accurate than its closest competitor and 6.13% more precise on average on
established benchmarks, but also achieves a 4.48% increase in accuracy on
OmniGen,along with exceptional robustness to common image perturbations. We
introduce not only a top-performing detector, but also a new benchmark and
framework for furthering universal AI image detection. The code and dataset are

Conclusion: ALISE框架成功实现了无需标注的高质量LiDAR实例分割，证明了无监督方法在3D场景理解中的潜力。

Abstract: The manual annotation of outdoor LiDAR point clouds for instance segmentation
is extremely costly and time-consuming. Current methods attempt to reduce this
burden but still rely on some form of human labeling. To completely eliminate
this dependency, we introduce ALISE, a novel framework that performs LiDAR
instance segmentation without any annotations. The central challenge is to
generate high-quality pseudo-labels in a fully unsupervised manner. Our
approach starts by employing Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), guided by text
and images, to produce initial pseudo-labels. We then refine these labels
through a dedicated spatio-temporal voting module, which combines 2D and 3D
semantics for both offline and online optimization. To achieve superior feature
learning, we further introduce two forms of semantic supervision: a set of 2D
prior-based losses that inject visual knowledge into the 3D network, and a
novel prototype-based contrastive loss that builds a discriminative feature
space by exploiting 3D semantic consistency. This comprehensive design results
in significant performance gains, establishing a new state-of-the-art for
unsupervised 3D instance segmentation. Remarkably, our approach even
outperforms MWSIS, a method that operates with supervision from ground-truth
(GT) 2D bounding boxes by a margin of 2.53% in mAP (50.95% vs. 48.42%).

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉搜索采用多阶段级联架构，导致查询图像和商品在不同阶段的表示存在差异，难以在用户体验和转化率之间达到帕累托最优。

Method: 基于VRQ（视觉对齐残差量化编码）对齐多视角表示，采用多阶段语义对齐方案，在保持视觉相似性先验的同时融入用户特定信息进行个性化偏好生成。

Conclusion: 以语义ID为中心的生成式架构能够统一检索和个性化，同时简化服务路径。

Abstract: Traditional vision search, similar to search and recommendation systems,
follows the multi-stage cascading architecture (MCA) paradigm to balance
efficiency and conversion. Specifically, the query image undergoes feature
extraction, recall, pre-ranking, and ranking stages, ultimately presenting the
user with semantically similar products that meet their preferences. This
multi-view representation discrepancy of the same object in the query and the
optimization objective collide across these stages, making it difficult to
achieve Pareto optimality in both user experience and conversion. In this
paper, an end-to-end generative framework, OneVision, is proposed to address
these problems. OneVision builds on VRQ, a vision-aligned residual quantization
encoding, which can align the vastly different representations of an object
across multiple viewpoints while preserving the distinctive features of each
product as much as possible. Then a multi-stage semantic alignment scheme is
adopted to maintain strong visual similarity priors while effectively
incorporating user-specific information for personalized preference generation.
In offline evaluations, OneVision performs on par with online MCA, while
improving inference efficiency by 21% through dynamic pruning. In A/B tests, it
achieves significant online improvements: +2.15% item CTR, +2.27% CVR, and
+3.12% order volume. These results demonstrate that a semantic ID centric,
generative architecture can unify retrieval and personalization while
simplifying the serving pathway.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效利用不可靠标签数据源来增强深度网络训练，解决了遥感领域标签数据稀缺的问题。

Abstract: Deep learning has gained broad interest in remote sensing image scene
classification thanks to the effectiveness of deep neural networks in
extracting the semantics from complex data. However, deep networks require
large amounts of training samples to obtain good generalization capabilities
and are sensitive to errors in the training labels. This is a problem in remote
sensing since highly reliable labels can be obtained at high costs and in
limited amount. However, many sources of less reliable labeled data are
available, e.g., obsolete digital maps. In order to train deep networks with
larger datasets, we propose both the combination of single or multiple weak
sources of labeled data with a small but reliable dataset to generate
multisource labeled datasets and a novel training strategy where the
reliability of each source is taken in consideration. This is done by
exploiting the transition matrices describing the statistics of the errors of
each source. The transition matrices are embedded into the labels and used
during the training process to weigh each label according to the related
source. The proposed method acts as a weighting scheme at gradient level, where
each instance contributes with different weights to the optimization of
different classes. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by
experiments on different datasets. The results proved the robustness and
capability of leveraging on unreliable source of labels of the proposed method.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for reliably deploying
machine learning models in the wild. Yet, most methods treat large pre-trained
models as monolithic encoders and rely solely on their final-layer
representations for detection. We challenge this wisdom. We reveal the
\textit{intermediate layers} of pre-trained models, shaped by residual
connections that subtly transform input projections, \textit{can} encode
\textit{surprisingly rich and diverse signals} for detecting distributional
shifts. Importantly, to exploit latent representation diversity across layers,
we introduce an entropy-based criterion to \textit{automatically} identify
layers offering the most complementary information in a training-free setting
-- \textit{without access to OOD data}. We show that selectively incorporating
these intermediate representations can increase the accuracy of OOD detection
by up to \textbf{$10\%$} in far-OOD and over \textbf{$7\%$} in near-OOD
benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art training-free methods across various
model architectures and training objectives. Our findings reveal a new avenue
for OOD detection research and uncover the impact of various training
objectives and model architectures on confidence-based OOD detection methods.

*Yi-Hsin Li,Thomas Sikora,Sebastian Knorr,Mårten Sjöström*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于光栅化的优化策略，将光栅化高斯核渲染的效率与Steered Mixture of Experts的边缘感知门控机制相结合，显著加速二维图像回归，同时保持模型稀疏性和重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Steered Mixture of Experts回归框架在图像重建、压缩、去噪和超分辨率方面表现出色，但其高计算成本限制了实际应用。

Method: 采用光栅化优化策略，用光栅化公式替代全局迭代优化，结合光栅化高斯核渲染效率和边缘感知门控机制。

Result: 实现了显著更快的参数更新和更内存高效的模型表示，支持原生超分辨率和图像去噪等应用。

Conclusion: 该方法在计算效率和重建保真度之间提供了新的平衡，适用于二维图像处理任务。

Abstract: The Steered Mixture of Experts regression framework has demonstrated strong
performance in image reconstruction, compression, denoising, and
super-resolution. However, its high computational cost limits practical
applications. This work introduces a rasterization-based optimization strategy
that combines the efficiency of rasterized Gaussian kernel rendering with the
edge-aware gating mechanism of the Steered Mixture of Experts. The proposed
method is designed to accelerate two-dimensional image regression while
maintaining the model's inherent sparsity and reconstruction quality. By
replacing global iterative optimization with a rasterized formulation, the
method achieves significantly faster parameter updates and more
memory-efficient model representations. In addition, the proposed framework
supports applications such as native super-resolution and image denoising,
which are not directly achievable with standard rasterized Gaussian kernel
approaches. The combination of fast rasterized optimization with the edge-aware
structure of the Steered Mixture of Experts provides a new balance between
computational efficiency and reconstruction fidelity for two-dimensional image
processing tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种自监督深度学习方法，用于在心脏磁共振图像中检测五个关键帧，包括收缩末期和舒张末期，以及三个额外关键帧，实现更好的心脏动态分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅从左心室容积曲线推导收缩末期和舒张末期，无法深入分析心肌运动模式，需要更精确的关键帧检测方法。

Method: 使用自监督深度学习，通过密集可变形配准场计算一维运动描述符，从特征曲线中基于简单规则确定关键帧。

Result: 在多个公共数据集上验证，相比基于容积的方法，检测精度提升30%-51%（短轴）和11%-47%（四腔心长轴），平均循环帧差低于1.31帧（短轴）和1.73帧（长轴）。

Conclusion: 该方法能够实现时间对齐的患者间和患者内心脏动态分析，不受心动周期或相位长度影响。

Abstract: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is the gold standard for assessing
cardiac function, but individual cardiac cycles complicate automatic temporal
comparison or sub-phase analysis. Accurate cardiac keyframe detection can
eliminate this problem. However, automatic methods solely derive end-systole
(ES) and end-diastole (ED) frames from left ventricular volume curves, which do
not provide a deeper insight into myocardial motion. We propose a
self-supervised deep learning method detecting five keyframes in short-axis
(SAX) and four-chamber long-axis (4CH) cine CMR. Initially, dense deformable
registration fields are derived from the images and used to compute a 1D motion
descriptor, which provides valuable insights into global cardiac contraction
and relaxation patterns. From these characteristic curves, keyframes are
determined using a simple set of rules. The method was independently evaluated
for both views using three public, multicentre, multidisease datasets. M&Ms-2
(n=360) dataset was used for training and evaluation, and M&Ms (n=345) and ACDC
(n=100) datasets for repeatability control. Furthermore, generalisability to
patients with rare congenital heart defects was tested using the German
Competence Network (GCN) dataset. Our self-supervised approach achieved
improved detection accuracy by 30% - 51% for SAX and 11% - 47% for 4CH in ED
and ES, as measured by cyclic frame difference (cFD), compared with the
volume-based approach. We can detect ED and ES, as well as three additional
keyframes throughout the cardiac cycle with a mean cFD below 1.31 frames for
SAX and 1.73 for LAX. Our approach enables temporally aligned inter- and
intra-patient analysis of cardiac dynamics, irrespective of cycle or phase
lengths. GitHub repository:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flow4Agent是一个利用光流运动先验来增强LLM长视频理解能力的新框架，通过时间粒度优化和运动token剪枝来减少视频冗余，在多个视频理解基准上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频理解面临时空内容冗余和MLLM上下文长度有限的挑战，现有方法主要依赖CLIP模型的语义先验，但忽略了运动信息的重要性。

Method: 提出Flow4Agent框架，包含两个核心模块：TGO利用粗粒度光流先验分组相似视觉内容，再用语义先验过滤无关场景；MTP利用细粒度光流信息剪枝高冗余视频token。

Result: 在多个视频MLLM基准测试中表现优异，特别是在小时级视频理解任务上，Video-MME达到64.7%，MLVU达到71.4%，LongVideoBench达到60.4%。

Conclusion: Flow4Agent通过引入光流运动先验有效解决了长视频冗余问题，显著提升了长视频理解性能，证明了运动信息在视频理解中的重要性。

Abstract: Long-form video understanding has always been a challenging problem due to
the significant redundancy in both temporal and spatial contents. This
challenge is further exacerbated by the limited context length of Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs). To address this issue, many previous works have
attempted to extract key video information, where the "key" is typically
semantic-aware and heavily dependent on the CLIP model as prior. In this paper,
we propose Flow4Agent, a novel framework that pioneeringly incorporates motion
priors from optical flow to facilitate LLM-based long video understanding.
Flow4Agent mitigates the redundancy in long videos at both temporal and spatial
levels through two core modules: Temporal Granularity Optimization (TGO)
adaptively refines framelevel hierarchies, which first leverages coarse flow
priors to group similar visual contents and then applies semantic priors to
filter out highly irrelevant scene information. Motion Token Pruning (MTP)
further refines the intra-frame visual representations, pruning high-redundancy
video tokens using fine-grained optical flow information. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our Flow4Agent outperforms existing methods across a wide
range of video MLLM benchmarks, especially for hour-level video understanding
tasks, achieving 64.7% on Video-MME, 71.4% on MLVU and 60.4% on LongVideoBench.

Abstract: Live-cell imaging (LCI) technology enables the detailed spatio-temporal
characterization of living cells at the single-cell level, which is critical
for advancing research in the life sciences, from biomedical applications to
bioprocessing. High-throughput setups with tens to hundreds of parallel cell
cultivations offer the potential for robust and reproducible insights. However,
these insights are obscured by the large amount of LCI data recorded per
experiment. Recent advances in state-of-the-art deep learning methods for cell
segmentation and tracking now enable the automated analysis of such large data
volumes, offering unprecedented opportunities to systematically study
single-cell dynamics. The next key challenge lies in integrating these powerful
tools into accessible, flexible, and user-friendly workflows that support
routine application in biological research. In this work, we present
acia-workflows, a platform that combines three key components: (1) the
Automated live-Cell Imaging Analysis (acia) Python library, which supports the
modular design of image analysis pipelines offering eight deep learning
segmentation and tracking approaches; (2) workflows that assemble the image
analysis pipeline, its software dependencies, documentation, and visualizations
into a single Jupyter Notebook, leading to accessible, reproducible and
scalable analysis workflows; and (3) a collection of application workflows
showcasing the analysis and customization capabilities in real-world
applications. Specifically, we present three workflows to investigate various
types of microfluidic LCI experiments ranging from growth rate comparisons to
precise, minute-resolution quantitative analyses of individual dynamic cells
responses to changing oxygen conditions. Our collection of more than ten
application workflows is open source and publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 昆虫分类对农业管理和生态研究至关重要，但由于昆虫特征复杂、类别不平衡和大规模数据集等问题，该任务仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 提出BioAutoML-NAS模型，使用图像和元数据等多模态数据，应用神经架构搜索自动学习每个单元内的最佳操作，通过多模态融合模块结合图像嵌入和元数据，采用交替双级优化训练策略。

Result: 在BIOSCAN-5M数据集上达到96.81%准确率、97.46%精确率、96.81%召回率和97.05% F1分数；在Insects-1M数据集上达到93.25%准确率、93.71%精确率、92.74%召回率和93.22% F1分数。

Conclusion: BioAutoML-NAS提供了准确、可靠的昆虫分类，支持现代可持续农业，显著优于现有的迁移学习、Transformer、AutoML和NAS方法。

Abstract: Insect classification is important for agricultural management and ecological
research, as it directly affects crop health and production. However, this task
remains challenging due to the complex characteristics of insects, class
imbalance, and large-scale datasets. To address these issues, we propose
BioAutoML-NAS, the first BioAutoML model using multimodal data, including
images, and metadata, which applies neural architecture search (NAS) for images
to automatically learn the best operations for each connection within each
cell. Multiple cells are stacked to form the full network, each extracting
detailed image feature representations. A multimodal fusion module combines
image embeddings with metadata, allowing the model to use both visual and
categorical biological information to classify insects. An alternating bi-level
optimization training strategy jointly updates network weights and architecture
parameters, while zero operations remove less important connections, producing
sparse, efficient, and high-performing architectures. Extensive evaluation on
the BIOSCAN-5M dataset demonstrates that BioAutoML-NAS achieves 96.81%
accuracy, 97.46% precision, 96.81% recall, and a 97.05% F1 score, outperforming
state-of-the-art transfer learning, transformer, AutoML, and NAS methods by
approximately 16%, 10%, and 8% respectively. Further validation on the
Insects-1M dataset obtains 93.25% accuracy, 93.71% precision, 92.74% recall,
and a 93.22% F1 score. These results demonstrate that BioAutoML-NAS provides
accurate, confident insect classification that supports modern sustainable
farming.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉自回归模型在图像生成方面取得突破，但其基于离散token预测的生成方式给合成图像检测带来新挑战，需要专门的方法来识别这类模型生成的图像。

Method: 引入离散分布差异感知transformer，将动态码本频率统计集成到注意力机制中，融合语义特征和量化误差潜在表示。

Conclusion: D3QE方法能有效检测自回归生成的图像，为应对新兴视觉AR模型带来的检测挑战提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The emergence of visual autoregressive (AR) models has revolutionized image
generation while presenting new challenges for synthetic image detection.
Unlike previous GAN or diffusion-based methods, AR models generate images
through discrete token prediction, exhibiting both marked improvements in image
synthesis quality and unique characteristics in their vector-quantized
representations. In this paper, we propose to leverage Discrete Distribution
Discrepancy-aware Quantization Error (D$^3$QE) for autoregressive-generated
image detection that exploits the distinctive patterns and the frequency
distribution bias of the codebook existing in real and fake images. We
introduce a discrete distribution discrepancy-aware transformer that integrates
dynamic codebook frequency statistics into its attention mechanism, fusing
semantic features and quantization error latent. To evaluate our method, we
construct a comprehensive dataset termed ARForensics covering 7 mainstream
visual AR models. Experiments demonstrate superior detection accuracy and
strong generalization of D$^3$QE across different AR models, with robustness to
real-world perturbations. Code is available at

*Jiesi Hu,Yanwu Yang,Zhiyu Ye,Jinyan Zhou,Jianfeng Cao,Hanyang Peng,Ting Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了弱监督上下文学习（WS-ICL）新范式，使用弱提示（如边界框或点）替代密集标签，显著降低医学图像分割的标注成本，同时保持与常规ICL模型相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的通用医学图像分割模型（交互式和上下文学习模型）虽然泛化能力强，但需要大量标注。交互式模型需要对每张图像重复用户提示，而ICL依赖密集的像素级标签，标注成本高昂。

Method: 提出WS-ICL方法，利用弱提示（边界框或点）作为上下文，而不是密集标签，减少了细粒度掩码的需求和所有图像的重复用户提示。

Result: 在三个保留基准测试中，WS-ICL在显著降低标注成本的同时，实现了与常规ICL模型相当的性能，并且在交互范式下也表现出高度竞争力。

Conclusion: WS-ICL是朝着更高效和统一的医学图像分割通用模型迈出的有希望的一步，代码和模型已公开。

Abstract: Universal models for medical image segmentation, such as interactive and
in-context learning (ICL) models, offer strong generalization but require
extensive annotations. Interactive models need repeated user prompts for each
image, while ICL relies on dense, pixel-level labels. To address this, we
propose Weakly Supervised In-Context Learning (WS-ICL), a new ICL paradigm that
leverages weak prompts (e.g., bounding boxes or points) instead of dense labels
for context. This approach significantly reduces annotation effort by
eliminating the need for fine-grained masks and repeated user prompting for all
images. We evaluated the proposed WS-ICL model on three held-out benchmarks.
Experimental results demonstrate that WS-ICL achieves performance comparable to
regular ICL models at a significantly lower annotation cost. In addition,
WS-ICL is highly competitive even under the interactive paradigm. These
findings establish WS-ICL as a promising step toward more efficient and unified
universal models for medical image segmentation. Our code and model are
publicly available at https://github.com/jiesihu/Weak-ICL.

Motivation: 现有工业异常检测研究主要关注制造场景，对象姿态和类别有限，而零售物流中的异常检测面临对象姿态和外观多样性的新挑战，现有基准已趋于饱和。

Method: 引入了一个新的大规模基准数据集，包含超过23万张图像、2.9万个缺陷实例和4.8万个不同对象，并进行了多种最先进异常检测方法的广泛评估。

Result: 现有最先进方法在该数据集上的AUROC得分不超过56.96%，远低于在制造场景中的表现（可达99.9%），表明现有方法难以处理姿态和外观的剧烈变化。

Conclusion: 该数据集为零售物流异常检测设立了新基准，鼓励未来研究解决这一具有挑战性的问题，数据集已公开可用。

Abstract: We present a novel large-scale dataset for defect detection in a logistics
setting. Recent work on industrial anomaly detection has primarily focused on
manufacturing scenarios with highly controlled poses and a limited number of
object categories. Existing benchmarks like MVTec-AD [6] and VisA [33] have
reached saturation, with state-of-the-art methods achieving up to 99.9% AUROC
scores. In contrast to manufacturing, anomaly detection in retail logistics
faces new challenges, particularly in the diversity and variability of object
pose and appearance. Leading anomaly detection methods fall short when applied
to this new setting. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new benchmark that
overcomes the current limitations of existing datasets. With over 230,000
images (and more than 29,000 defective instances), it is 40 times larger than
MVTec-AD and contains more than 48,000 distinct objects. To validate the
difficulty of the problem, we conduct an extensive evaluation of multiple
state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods, demonstrating that they do not
surpass 56.96% AUROC on our dataset. Further qualitative analysis confirms that
existing methods struggle to leverage normal samples under heavy pose and
appearance variation. With our large-scale dataset, we set a new benchmark and
encourage future research towards solving this challenging problem in retail
logistics anomaly detection. The dataset is available for download under

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了医学影像中的token mixer设计，在MetaFormer架构下比较了池化、卷积和注意力机制，发现在分类任务中低复杂度token mixer足够，而在分割任务中卷积的局部归纳偏置至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MetaFormer架构在自然图像领域已有深入研究，但在医学影像中的应用稀少，且缺乏对不同token mixer的系统比较，可能忽略了更适合医学影像的设计选择。

Method: 在MetaFormer架构中系统分析池化、卷积和注意力三类token mixer，在8个医学影像数据集上评估图像分类和语义分割任务，并研究从自然图像预训练权重的迁移效果。

Result: 分类任务中低复杂度token mixer（如分组卷积或池化）足够，预训练权重即使存在领域差异仍有效；分割任务中卷积token mixer的局部归纳偏置至关重要，分组卷积在减少计算量和参数的同时表现最佳。

Conclusion: 医学影像任务需要针对性地选择token mixer：分类任务可用简单设计，分割任务需卷积的局部建模能力，分组卷积是平衡性能与效率的最佳选择。

Abstract: The generalization of the Transformer architecture via MetaFormer has
reshaped our understanding of its success in computer vision. By replacing
self-attention with simpler token mixers, MetaFormer provides strong baselines
for vision tasks. However, while extensively studied on natural image datasets,
its use in medical imaging remains scarce, and existing works rarely compare
different token mixers, potentially overlooking more suitable designs choices.
In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of token mixers for
medical imaging. We systematically analyze pooling-, convolution-, and
attention-based token mixers within the MetaFormer architecture on image
classification (global prediction task) and semantic segmentation (dense
prediction task). Our evaluation spans eight datasets covering diverse
modalities and common challenges in the medical domain. Given the prevalence of
pretraining from natural images to mitigate medical data scarcity, we also
examine transferring pretrained weights to new token mixers. Our results show
that, for classification, low-complexity token mixers (e.g. grouped convolution
or pooling) are sufficient, aligning with findings on natural images.
Pretrained weights remain useful despite the domain gap introduced by the new
token mixer. For segmentation, we find that the local inductive bias of
convolutional token mixers is essential. Grouped convolutions emerge as the
preferred choice, as they reduce runtime and parameter count compared to
standard convolutions, while the MetaFormer's channel-MLPs already provide the
necessary cross-channel interactions. Our code is available on GitHub.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is vital for safety-critical applications
such as surveillance, autonomous navigation, and medical imaging, where
visibility degradation can impair downstream task performance. Recently,
diffusion models have emerged as a promising generative paradigm for LLIE due
to their capacity to model complex image distributions via iterative denoising.
This survey provides an up-to-date critical analysis of diffusion models for
LLIE, distinctively featuring an in-depth comparative performance evaluation
against Generative Adversarial Network and Transformer-based state-of-the-art
methods, a thorough examination of practical deployment challenges, and a
forward-looking perspective on the role of emerging paradigms like foundation
models. We propose a multi-perspective taxonomy encompassing six categories:
Intrinsic Decomposition, Spectral & Latent, Accelerated, Guided, Multimodal,
and Autonomous; that map enhancement methods across physical priors,
conditioning schemes, and computational efficiency. Our taxonomy is grounded in
a hybrid view of both the model mechanism and the conditioning signals. We
evaluate qualitative failure modes, benchmark inconsistencies, and trade-offs
between interpretability, generalization, and inference efficiency. We also
discuss real-world deployment constraints (e.g., memory, energy use) and
ethical considerations. This survey aims to guide the next generation of
diffusion-based LLIE research by highlighting trends and surfacing open
research questions, including novel conditioning, real-time adaptation, and the
potential of foundation models.

Conclusion: DMCA通过数据驱动的方式自适应学习视频表示，在多种应用中展现出优于传统方法的性能。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel methodology of adapting the representation of
videos based on the dynamics of their scene content variation. In particular,
we demonstrate how the clustering of dynamic mode decomposition eigenvalues can
be leveraged to learn an adaptive video representation for separating
structurally distinct morphologies of a video. We extend the morphological
component analysis (MCA) algorithm, which uses multiple predefined incoherent
dictionaries and a sparsity prior to separate distinct sources in signals, by
introducing our novel eigenspace clustering technique to obtain data-driven MCA
dictionaries, which we call dynamic morphological component analysis (DMCA).
After deriving our novel algorithm, we offer a motivational example of DMCA
applied to a still image, then demonstrate DMCA's effectiveness in denoising
applications on videos from the Adobe 240fps dataset. Afterwards, we provide an
example of DMCA enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio of a faint target summed
with a sea state, and conclude the paper by applying DMCA to separate a bicycle
from wind clutter in inverse synthetic aperture radar images.

Abstract: Robust invisible watermarking aims to embed hidden information into images
such that the watermark can survive various image manipulations. However, the
rise of powerful diffusion-based image generation and editing techniques poses
a new threat to these watermarking schemes. In this paper, we present a
theoretical study and method demonstrating that diffusion models can
effectively break robust image watermarks that were designed to resist
conventional perturbations. We show that a diffusion-driven ``image
regeneration'' process can erase embedded watermarks while preserving
perceptual image content. We further introduce a novel guided diffusion attack
that explicitly targets the watermark signal during generation, significantly
degrading watermark detectability. Theoretically, we prove that as an image
undergoes sufficient diffusion-based transformation, the mutual information
between the watermarked image and the embedded watermark payload vanishes,
resulting in decoding failure. Experimentally, we evaluate our approach on
multiple state-of-the-art watermarking schemes (including the deep
learning-based methods StegaStamp, TrustMark, and VINE) and demonstrate
near-zero watermark recovery rates after attack, while maintaining high visual
fidelity of the regenerated images. Our findings highlight a fundamental
vulnerability in current robust watermarking techniques against generative
model-based attacks, underscoring the need for new watermarking strategies in
the era of generative AI.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用预训练多模态大语言模型从社交媒体和新闻图片中检测和测量冰雹尺寸，通过单阶段和两阶段提示策略，在奥地利474张冰雹图像上实现平均绝对误差1.12cm的测量精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用社交媒体图像补充传统冰雹传感器，实现对严重天气事件的快速详细评估。

Method: 使用预训练多模态大语言模型，比较单阶段和两阶段提示策略，其中两阶段策略利用图像中参考物体（如人手）提供尺寸线索。

Result: 预训练模型无需微调即可从图像中测量冰雹直径，最佳模型平均绝对误差为1.12cm，两阶段提示提高了大多数模型的可靠性。

Conclusion: 现成模型能够从社交媒体图像中提取有意义且空间密集的信息，补充传统冰雹传感器，为未来冰雹事件的实时应用奠定基础。

Abstract: This study examines the use of social media and news images to detect and
measure hailstones, utilizing pre-trained multimodal large language models. The
dataset for this study comprises 474 crowdsourced images of hailstones from
documented hail events in Austria, which occurred between January 2022 and
September 2024. These hailstones have maximum diameters ranging from 2 to 11cm.
We estimate the hail diameters and compare four different models utilizing
one-stage and two-stage prompting strategies. The latter utilizes additional
size cues from reference objects, such as human hands, within the image. Our
results show that pretrained models already have the potential to measure
hailstone diameters from images with an average mean absolute error of 1.12cm
for the best model. In comparison to a single-stage prompt, two-stage prompting
improves the reliability of most models. Our study suggests that these
off-the-shelf models, even without fine-tuning, can complement traditional hail
sensors by extracting meaningful and spatially dense information from social
media imagery, enabling faster and more detailed assessments of severe weather
events. The automated real-time image harvesting from social media and other
sources remains an open task, but it will make our approach directly applicable
to future hail events.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决持续学习环境下图像描述任务中的灾难性遗忘问题，以及随时间推移视觉概念与语言对齐的困难

Method: 基于预训练的ViT-GPT-2架构，结合交叉熵损失与三个额外组件：基于提示的余弦相似度损失、CLIP风格损失和语言引导对比损失

Result: 该方法有效缓解了灾难性遗忘，在语义描述对齐方面优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: 提出的多损失框架在持续图像描述任务中表现出色，无需推理时额外开销即可实现更好的语义对齐

Abstract: Generating accurate and coherent image captions in a continual learning
setting remains a major challenge due to catastrophic forgetting and the
difficulty of aligning evolving visual concepts with language over time. In
this work, we propose a novel multi-loss framework for continual image
captioning that integrates semantic guidance through prompt-based continual
learning and contrastive alignment. Built upon a pretrained ViT-GPT-2 backbone,
our approach combines standard cross-entropy loss with three additional
components: (1) a prompt-based cosine similarity loss that aligns image
embeddings with synthetically constructed prompts encoding objects, attributes,
and actions; (2) a CLIP-style loss that promotes alignment between image
embeddings and target caption embedding; and (3) a language-guided contrastive
loss that employs a triplet loss to enhance class-level discriminability
between tasks. Notably, our approach introduces no additional overhead at
inference time and requires no prompts during caption generation. We find that
this approach mitigates catastrophic forgetting, while achieving better
semantic caption alignment compared to state-of-the-art methods. The code can

TL;DR: 通用实例搜索模型在犯罪调查中能大幅减少人工分析监控视频的工作量，但研究发现这些模型具有意外涌现的能力：即使在没有人类主体的数据集上训练，也能通过过学习识别特定个体，引发隐私担忧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决通用实例搜索模型意外获得个体识别能力的问题，这种能力可能被用于身份识别和个人画像分析，而目前缺乏明确的去标识化标准。

Method: 评估了两种技术保护措施：索引排除和混淆损失，通过实验测试这些方法在限制模型人员重识别能力方面的效果。

Result: 结合两种方法可将人员重识别准确率降至2%以下，同时保持82%的非人物体检索性能，但发现这些缓解措施存在关键漏洞，包括使用部分人物图像可能绕过保护。

Conclusion: 研究结果凸显了AI治理和数据保护交叉领域的紧迫监管问题：如何分类和监管具有涌现识别能力的系统？以及应要求哪些技术标准来防止看似良性应用中出现识别能力？

Abstract: Generic instance search models can dramatically reduce the manual effort
required to analyze vast surveillance footage during criminal investigations by
retrieving specific objects of interest to law enforcement. However, our
research reveals an unintended emergent capability: through overlearning, these
models can single out specific individuals even when trained on datasets
without human subjects. This capability raises concerns regarding
identification and profiling of individuals based on their personal data, while
there is currently no clear standard on how de-identification can be achieved.
We evaluate two technical safeguards to curtail a model's person
re-identification capacity: index exclusion and confusion loss. Our experiments
demonstrate that combining these approaches can reduce person re-identification
accuracy to below 2% while maintaining 82% of retrieval performance for
non-person objects. However, we identify critical vulnerabilities in these
mitigations, including potential circumvention using partial person images.
These findings highlight urgent regulatory questions at the intersection of AI
governance and data protection: How should we classify and regulate systems
with emergent identification capabilities? And what technical standards should
be required to prevent identification capabilities from developing in seemingly
benign applications?

demonstrate that the space contains interesting architectures, which, when
using identical training setup, outperform state-of-the-art hand-crafted

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在长视频理解中面临两个关键挑战：1）大量冗余信息的干扰；2）模型难以动态适应复杂层次结构并准确识别关键帧。

Method: VideoMiner迭代分割、描述和聚类长视频形成层次树结构，结合专门为树结构设计的T-GRPO强化学习方法，集成事件级时空信息并受问题引导。

Result: 在所有长视频理解任务中取得优越性能，发现模型会自发生成推理链，树生长辅助素动态调整扩展深度，获得准确性和效率提升。

Conclusion: VideoMiner通过层次树结构和T-GRPO强化学习有效解决了长视频理解中的关键挑战，实现了准确高效的关键帧定位和视频理解。

Abstract: Understanding hour-long videos with multi-modal large language models
(MM-LLMs) enriches the landscape of human-centered AI applications. However,
for end-to-end video understanding with LLMs, uniformly sampling video frames
results in LLMs being overwhelmed by a vast amount of irrelevant information as
video length increases. Existing hierarchical key frame extraction methods
improve the accuracy of video understanding but still face two critical
challenges. 1) How can the interference of extensive redundant information in
long videos be mitigated? 2) How can a model dynamically adapt to complex
hierarchical structures while accurately identifying key frames? To address
these issues, we propose VideoMiner, which iteratively segments, captions, and
clusters long videos, forming a hierarchical tree structure. The proposed
VideoMiner progresses from long videos to events to frames while preserving
temporal coherence, effectively addressing the first challenge. To precisely
locate key frames, we introduce T-GRPO, a tree-based group relative policy
optimization in reinforcement learning method that guides the exploration of
the VideoMiner. The proposed T-GRPO is specifically designed for tree
structures, integrating spatiotemporal information at the event level while
being guided by the question, thus solving the second challenge. We achieve
superior performance in all long-video understanding tasks and uncover several
interesting insights. Our proposed T-GRPO surprisingly incentivizes the model
to spontaneously generate a reasoning chain. Additionally, the designed tree
growth auxin dynamically adjusts the expansion depth, obtaining accuracy and
efficiency gains. The code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D人脸建模方法依赖3D形变模型，限制了表示能力；基于优化的方法质量高但计算昂贵。需要一种既能表达丰富几何信息又高效的方法。

Method: 扩展学习顶点下降(LVD)方法，集成逐顶点神经场优化与动态预测3D关键点的全局结构指导，使用相对空间编码迭代优化网格顶点，无需密集3D监督。

Result: 在单视角设置下达到最先进性能，在多视角场景中保持高度竞争力，同时显著减少推理时间。

Conclusion: GLVD实现了表达性强且适应性好的几何重建，同时保持了计算效率，为3D人脸重建提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing 3D face modeling methods usually depend on 3D Morphable Models,
which inherently constrain the representation capacity to fixed shape priors.
Optimization-based approaches offer high-quality reconstructions but tend to be
computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce GLVD, a hybrid method for
3D face reconstruction from few-shot images that extends Learned Vertex Descent
(LVD) by integrating per-vertex neural field optimization with global
structural guidance from dynamically predicted 3D keypoints. By incorporating
relative spatial encoding, GLVD iteratively refines mesh vertices without
requiring dense 3D supervision. This enables expressive and adaptable geometry
reconstruction while maintaining computational efficiency. GLVD achieves
state-of-the-art performance in single-view settings and remains highly
competitive in multi-view scenarios, all while substantially reducing inference
time.

Motivation: 基于视觉的PPO算法在机器人腹腔镜手术任务中面临视觉输入维度高、奖励稀疏以及从原始视觉数据中提取任务相关特征困难等挑战。

Method: 将MedFlamingo模型与PPO算法集成，在每个episode开始时处理任务观察和指令以生成高级规划token，结合医学专业知识与实时视觉反馈。

Result: 在LapGym的五个腹腔镜手术任务环境中，MedFlamingo PPO在所有环境中任务成功率超过70%，相比基线方法提升66.67%到1114.29%，且收敛速度更快。

Conclusion: 医学专业知识在机器人手术规划和决策中具有重要价值，领域特定的视觉语言模型能有效提升手术任务的性能表现。

Abstract: Vision-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) struggles with visual
observation-based robotic laparoscopic surgical tasks due to the
high-dimensional nature of visual input, the sparsity of rewards in surgical
environments, and the difficulty of extracting task-relevant features from raw
visual data. We introduce a simple approach integrating MedFlamingo, a medical
domain-specific Vision-Language Model, with PPO. Our method is evaluated on
five diverse laparoscopic surgery task environments in LapGym, using only
endoscopic visual observations. MedFlamingo PPO outperforms and converges
faster compared to both standard vision-based PPO and OpenFlamingo PPO
baselines, achieving task success rates exceeding 70% across all environments,
with improvements ranging from 66.67% to 1114.29% compared to baseline. By
processing task observations and instructions once per episode to generate
high-level planning tokens, our method efficiently combines medical expertise
with real-time visual feedback. Our results highlight the value of specialized
medical knowledge in robotic surgical planning and decision-making.

TL;DR: CAPTCHA作为评估视觉语言模型空间推理能力的真实基准，研究发现逐步推理对解决CAPTCHA至关重要，现有商业模型表现不佳（准确率约21.9%）。作者提出CAPTCHA-X基准和基于推理的VLM框架，将准确率提升至83.9%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAPTCHA已从人机验证工具演变为评估视觉语言模型空间推理能力的真实基准，但现有商业模型在此类高难度空间推理任务上表现不佳，需要系统研究推理能力的重要性。

Method: 引入CAPTCHA-X基准，包含7类CAPTCHA的逐步推理解决方案和标注；定义5个推理导向的评估指标；提出基于代理的VLM框架，利用模型内在推理能力。

Result: 在5种高难度CAPTCHA类型上达到最先进性能，平均解决准确率为83.9%，显著超越现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前模型的局限性，并强调了推理能力在推进视觉空间挑战中的重要性。

Abstract: CAPTCHA, originally designed to distinguish humans from robots, has evolved
into a real-world benchmark for assessing the spatial reasoning capabilities of
vision-language models. In this work, we first show that step-by-step reasoning
is crucial for vision-language models (VLMs) to solve CAPTCHAs, which represent
high-difficulty spatial reasoning tasks, and that current commercial
vision-language models still struggle with such reasoning. In particular, we
observe that most commercial VLMs (e.g., Gemini, Claude, GPT, etc.) fail to
effectively solve CAPTCHAs and thus achieve low accuracy (around 21.9 percent).
However, our findings indicate that requiring the model to perform step-by-step
reasoning before generating the final coordinates can significantly enhance its
solving accuracy, underscoring the severity of the gap. To systematically study
this issue, we introduce CAPTCHA-X, the first real-world CAPTCHA benchmark with
reasoning, covering seven categories of CAPTCHAs (such as Gobang, hCaptcha,
etc.) with step-by-step action solutions and grounding annotations. We further
define five reasoning-oriented metrics that enable a comprehensive evaluation
of models reasoning capabilities. To validate the effectiveness of reasoning,
we also propose a general agentic VLM-based framework that incorporates the
models inherent reasoning abilities. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance across five high-difficulty CAPTCHA types, with an average solving
accuracy of 83.9 percent, substantially surpassing existing baselines. These
results reveal the limitations of current models and highlight the importance
of reasoning in advancing visual-spatial challenges in the future.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合注意力图和统计过滤的方法，为Vision Transformers生成更忠实和可解释的解释，并通过人类注视数据评估与人类感知的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的ViT解释方法往往依赖注意力权重，但会产生噪声图，因为注意力捕获的是每层内token-to-token的交互。虽然已有方法结合了MLP块，但我们认为经过适当过滤的注意力仍然是有价值的可解释信号。

Method: 将注意力图与最初为CNN提出的统计过滤相结合，去除噪声或无信息模式，生成更忠实的解释。还扩展了类特定变体以产生区分性解释。

Result: 评估显示该方法相比流行的最先进方法能产生更清晰和更可解释的图。除了基于扰动的忠实度指标外，还结合人类注视数据评估与人类感知的一致性。在多个数据集上，该方法始终优于或与SOTA方法相当，同时保持高效和人类可理解。

Conclusion: 经过适当过滤的注意力仍然是Vision Transformers的有价值可解释信号，结合统计过滤和人类感知评估可以产生更忠实和可解释的解释。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) has become increasingly important with the rise of large
transformer models, yet many explanation methods designed for CNNs transfer
poorly to Vision Transformers (ViTs). Existing ViT explanations often rely on
attention weights, which tend to yield noisy maps as they capture
token-to-token interactions within each layer.While attribution methods
incorporating MLP blocks have been proposed, we argue that attention remains a
valuable and interpretable signal when properly filtered. We propose a method
that combines attention maps with a statistical filtering, initially proposed
for CNNs, to remove noisy or uninformative patterns and produce more faithful
explanations. We further extend our approach with a class-specific variant that
yields discriminative explanations. Evaluation against popular state-of-the-art
methods demonstrates that our approach produces sharper and more interpretable
maps. In addition to perturbation-based faithfulness metrics, we incorporate
human gaze data to assess alignment with human perception, arguing that human
interpretability remains essential for XAI. Across multiple datasets, our
approach consistently outperforms or is comparable to the SOTA methods while
remaining efficient and human plausible.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-Thought机制在文本任务中提升了推理能力，但在视频理解中应用不足且常常降低性能，产生误导性内部独白，导致视觉细节幻觉和正确直觉被覆盖。

Method: 提出Visual Evidence Reward强化学习框架，明确奖励生成基于可验证视觉证据的推理轨迹，防止模型偏离实际视觉内容。

Result: 在10个多样化视频理解基准测试中，Video-VER方法持续取得最佳性能，证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 揭示了视频中心推理的独特挑战，鼓励开发能够将推理牢固基于视觉证据的AI模型，实现"边看边思考"而不仅仅是"先思考再回答"。

Abstract: Video reasoning, the task of enabling machines to infer from dynamic visual
content through multi-step logic, is crucial for advanced AI. While the
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism has enhanced reasoning in text-based tasks,
its application to video understanding remains underexplored. This paper
presents a systematic analysis revealing that CoT often degrades performance in
video reasoning, generating verbose but misleading internal monologues, and
leading to hallucinated visual details and overridden correct intuitions - a
phenomenon we term "visual thinking drift". We explain this drift through a
Bayesian lens, positing that CoT traces often diverge from actual visual
evidence, instead amplifying internal biases or language priors, causing models
to storytell rather than engage in grounded reasoning. To counteract this, we
introduce Visual Evidence Reward (VER), a novel reinforcement learning
framework that explicitly rewards the generation of reasoning traces that are
verifiably grounded in visual evidence. Comprehensive evaluation across 10
diverse video understanding benchmarks demonstrates that our Video-VER
consistently achieves top performance. Our work sheds light on the distinct
challenges of video-centric reasoning and encourages the development of AI that
robustly grounds its inferences in visual evidence - for large multimodal
models that not only "think before answering", but also "see while thinking".

Conclusion: 该数据集为左心耳形态分析等研究提供了宝贵的资源，填补了高质量心脏结构分割数据的空白，有助于推动相关医学影像分析技术的发展。

Abstract: Despite the success of advanced segmentation frameworks such as
TotalSegmentator (TS), accurate segmentations of the left atrial appendage
(LAA), coronary arteries (CAs), and pulmonary veins (PVs) remain a significant
challenge in medical imaging. In this work, we present the first open-source,
anatomically coherent dataset of curated, high-resolution segmentations for
these structures, supplemented with whole-heart labels produced by TS on the
publicly available ImageCAS dataset consisting of 1000 cardiac computed
tomography angiography (CCTA) scans. One purpose of the data set is to foster
novel approaches to the analysis of LAA morphology.
  LAA segmentations on ImageCAS were generated using a state-of-the-art
segmentation framework developed specifically for high resolution LAA
segmentation. We trained the network on a large private dataset with manual
annotations provided by medical readers guided by a trained cardiologist and
transferred the model to ImageCAS data. CA labels were improved from the
original ImageCAS annotations, while PV segmentations were refined from TS
outputs. In addition, we provide a list of scans from ImageCAS that contains
common data flaws such as step artefacts, LAAs extending beyond the scanner's
field of view, and other types of data defects.

Motivation: 现有基于张量的高光谱图像融合方法通常只能有效利用一个或两个先验，难以同时整合多级先验，因为这会增加模型复杂度并带来权重平衡和多块结构优化的挑战。

Method: 通过块项分解将潜在高空间-光谱分辨率图像分解为光谱子空间和空间映射，然后构建空间张量编码高阶空间低秩性和平滑性先验，使用非凸模式混洗张量相关总变分进行联合建模，并设计了基于线性化交替方向乘子法的高效优化算法。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验证明了所提算法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该模型能够紧凑地建模高光谱图像的多级先验，并通过理论证明和实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Fusing a hyperspectral image with a multispectral image acquired over the
same scene, \textit{i.e.}, hyperspectral image super-resolution, has become a
popular computational way to access the latent high-spatial-spectral-resolution
image. To date, a variety of fusion methods have been proposed, among which the
tensor-based ones have testified that multiple priors, such as multidimensional
low-rankness and spatial total variation at multiple levels, effectively drive
the fusion process. However, existing tensor-based models can only effectively
leverage one or two priors at one or two levels, since simultaneously
incorporating multi-level priors inevitably increases model complexity. This
introduces challenges in both balancing the weights of different priors and
optimizing multi-block structures. Concerning this, we present a novel
hyperspectral super-resolution model compactly characterizing these multi-level
priors of hyperspectral images within the tensor framework. Firstly, the
proposed model decouples the spectral low-rankness and spatial priors by
casting the latent high-spatial-spectral-resolution image into spectral
subspace and spatial maps via block term decomposition. Secondly, these spatial
maps are stacked as the spatial tensor encoding the high-order spatial
low-rankness and smoothness priors, which are co-modeled via the proposed
non-convex mode-shuffled tensor correlated total variation. Finally, we draw
inspiration from the linearized alternating direction method of multipliers to
design an efficient algorithm to optimize the resulting model, theoretically
proving its Karush-Kuhn-Tucker convergence under mild conditions. Experiments
on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
The code implementation will be available from https://github.com/WongYinJ.

Motivation: 当前生存分析模型难以解释，原型学习方法存在局部相似性和静态匹配的局限，缺乏与基因组数据的语义对齐。

Method: 建立统一特征原型空间，整合WSI全局局部特征和基因组数据；提出表型表示、指数原型更新策略和分层原型匹配方案。

Result: 在四个公开癌症数据集上的评估显示，该方法在准确性和互操作性方面优于当前领先的单模态和多模态生存预测技术。

Conclusion: FeatProto为关键医疗应用中的原型学习提供了新视角，增强了可追溯和可解释的决策过程。

Abstract: Survival analysis plays a vital role in making clinical decisions. However,
the models currently in use are often difficult to interpret, which reduces
their usefulness in clinical settings. Prototype learning presents a potential
solution, yet traditional methods focus on local similarities and static
matching, neglecting the broader tumor context and lacking strong semantic
alignment with genomic data. To overcome these issues, we introduce an
innovative prototype-based multimodal framework, FeatProto, aimed at enhancing
cancer survival prediction by addressing significant limitations in current
prototype learning methodologies within pathology. Our framework establishes a
unified feature prototype space that integrates both global and local features
of whole slide images (WSI) with genomic profiles. This integration facilitates
traceable and interpretable decision-making processes. Our approach includes
three main innovations: (1) A robust phenotype representation that merges
critical patches with global context, harmonized with genomic data to minimize
local bias. (2) An Exponential Prototype Update Strategy (EMA ProtoUp) that
sustains stable cross-modal associations and employs a wandering mechanism to
adapt prototypes flexibly to tumor heterogeneity. (3) A hierarchical prototype
matching scheme designed to capture global centrality, local typicality, and
cohort-level trends, thereby refining prototype inference. Comprehensive
evaluations on four publicly available cancer datasets indicate that our method
surpasses current leading unimodal and multimodal survival prediction
techniques in both accuracy and interoperability, providing a new perspective
on prototype learning for critical medical applications. Our source code is

enhance both classification and segmentation. Rather than functioning as a
standalone model, SSGNet augments existing baselines by expanding training data
with StyleGAN3 generated images and refining labels through iterative pseudo
labeling. Experiments across multiple medical imaging benchmarks demonstrate
consistent gains in classification and segmentation performance, while Frechet
Inception Distance analysis confirms the high quality of generated samples.
These results highlight SSGNet as a practical strategy to mitigate annotation
bottlenecks and improve robustness in medical image analysis.

TL;DR: MeDiM是首个医学离散扩散模型，通过学习跨模态的共享分布，无需特定模态组件即可统一图像和文本生成任务，包括图像-文本翻译和联合生成图像-报告对。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成式医学模型受限于特定模态场景，无法整合来自影像、病理和临床笔记的互补证据，限制了其发展成为能够跨整个生物医学数据谱系学习和推理的基础模型。

Method: 基于离散扩散框架，MeDiM通过共享概率空间桥接视觉和语言表示。采用多模态大语言模型作为扩散主干，利用其先验知识和跨模态推理能力。关键设计包括：(1)移除因果注意力掩码以实现双向上下文；(2)注入连续时间步嵌入以实现扩散感知。

Result: 实验显示高质量的医学生成（MIMIC-CXR上FID 16.60，PathGen上FID 24.19）和准确的报告生成（METEOR 0.2650和0.2580）。联合生成的图像-报告对进一步提升了下游性能（BLEU-1 +6.43%，BLEU-2 +18.57%，BLEU-3 +31.58%，METEOR +4.80%）。

Conclusion: MeDiM支持连贯且临床基础的多模态输出，展示了跨模态医学生成的有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative medical models are constrained by
modality-specific scenarios that hinder the integration of complementary
evidence from imaging, pathology, and clinical notes. This fragmentation limits
their evolution into foundation models that can learn and reason across the
full spectrum of biomedical data. We propose MeDiM, the first medical discrete
diffusion model that learns shared distributions across modalities without
modality-specific components. MeDiM unifies multiple generative tasks:
translating between images and text, and jointly producing image-report pairs
across domains in response to prompts. Built on a discrete diffusion framework,
MeDiM bridges vision and language representations through a shared
probabilistic space. To enable unified and flexible medical generation, we
employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) as the diffusion backbone,
leveraging its prior knowledge and cross-modal reasoning. Two key designs are
introduced: (1) removing the causal attention mask for bidirectional context,
and (2) injecting continuous timestep embeddings for diffusion awareness.
Experiments demonstrate high-fidelity medical generation (FID 16.60 on
MIMIC-CXR and FID 24.19 on PathGen) and accurate report generation (METEOR
0.2650 and 0.2580). Jointly generated image-report pairs further enhance
downstream performance (plus6.43 percent BLEU-1, plus18.57 percent BLEU-2,
plus31.58 percent BLEU-3, plus4.80 percent METEOR), showing that MeDiM supports
coherent and clinically grounded multimodal outputs.

TL;DR: FlowRVS将视频目标分割重新定义为条件连续流问题，通过语言引导的变形从视频整体表示直接生成目标掩码，在多个基准测试中达到新的最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统'定位-分割'流水线中的信息瓶颈问题，避免语义简化为粗糙几何提示，并改善时间一致性。

Method: 提出FlowRVS框架，利用预训练T2V模型，学习从视频整体表示到目标掩码的语言引导变形过程。

Result: 在MeViS上达到51.1的J&F分数（比之前SOTA提高1.6），在零样本Ref-DAVIS17上达到73.3（提高2.7）。

Conclusion: 将视频理解任务建模为连续变形过程具有显著潜力，FlowRVS的单阶段生成方法在RVOS任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) requires segmenting specific
objects in a video guided by a natural language description. The core challenge
of RVOS is to anchor abstract linguistic concepts onto a specific set of pixels
and continuously segment them through the complex dynamics of a video. Faced
with this difficulty, prior work has often decomposed the task into a pragmatic
`locate-then-segment' pipeline. However, this cascaded design creates an
information bottleneck by simplifying semantics into coarse geometric prompts
(e.g, point), and struggles to maintain temporal consistency as the segmenting
process is often decoupled from the initial language grounding. To overcome
these fundamental limitations, we propose FlowRVS, a novel framework that
reconceptualizes RVOS as a conditional continuous flow problem. This allows us
to harness the inherent strengths of pretrained T2V models, fine-grained pixel
control, text-video semantic alignment, and temporal coherence. Instead of
conventional generating from noise to mask or directly predicting mask, we
reformulate the task by learning a direct, language-guided deformation from a
video's holistic representation to its target mask. Our one-stage, generative
approach achieves new state-of-the-art results across all major RVOS
benchmarks. Specifically, achieving a $\mathcal{J}\&\mathcal{F}$ of 51.1 in
MeViS (+1.6 over prior SOTA) and 73.3 in the zero shot Ref-DAVIS17 (+2.7),
demonstrating the significant potential of modeling video understanding tasks
as continuous deformation processes.

Conclusion: 该方法在双手3D手部运动预测方面显著优于现有基线方法，特别是在零样本泛化到日常图像场景中表现出色。

Abstract: We tackle the problem of forecasting bimanual 3D hand motion & articulation
from a single image in everyday settings. To address the lack of 3D hand
annotations in diverse settings, we design an annotation pipeline consisting of
a diffusion model to lift 2D hand keypoint sequences to 4D hand motion. For the
forecasting model, we adopt a diffusion loss to account for the multimodality
in hand motion distribution. Extensive experiments across 6 datasets show the
benefits of training on diverse data with imputed labels (14% improvement) and
effectiveness of our lifting (42% better) & forecasting (16.4% gain) models,
over the best baselines, especially in zero-shot generalization to everyday

<details>

Motivation: 视频条件4D形状生成旨在直接从输入视频中恢复随时间变化的3D几何和视角一致的外观，但现有方法存在鲁棒性和时间一致性问题。

Method: 基于大规模预训练3D模型，引入三个关键组件：时间注意力机制、时间感知点采样和4D潜在锚定、跨帧噪声共享，以增强时间一致性。

Result: 在多样化野外视频上，该方法相比基线提高了鲁棒性和感知保真度，减少了失败模式，能够准确捕捉非刚性运动、体积变化和拓扑转换。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了从视频到4D形状的原生端到端生成，在时间一致性和生成质量方面优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: Video-conditioned 4D shape generation aims to recover time-varying 3D
geometry and view-consistent appearance directly from an input video. In this
work, we introduce a native video-to-4D shape generation framework that
synthesizes a single dynamic 3D representation end-to-end from the video. Our
framework introduces three key components based on large-scale pre-trained 3D
models: (i) a temporal attention that conditions generation on all frames while
producing a time-indexed dynamic representation; (ii) a time-aware point
sampling and 4D latent anchoring that promote temporally consistent geometry
and texture; and (iii) noise sharing across frames to enhance temporal
stability. Our method accurately captures non-rigid motion, volume changes, and
even topological transitions without per-frame optimization. Across diverse
in-the-wild videos, our method improves robustness and perceptual fidelity and
reduces failure modes compared with the baselines.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have sparked exciting new possibilities
in the field of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, video generation models are
now being explored as controllable virtual testing environments.
Simultaneously, end-to-end (E2E) driving models have emerged as a streamlined
alternative to conventional modular autonomous driving systems, gaining
popularity for their simplicity and scalability. However, the application of
these techniques to simulation and planning raises important questions. First,
while video generation models can generate increasingly realistic videos, can
these videos faithfully adhere to the specified conditions and be realistic
enough for E2E autonomous planner evaluation? Second, given that data is
crucial for understanding and controlling E2E planners, how can we gain deeper
insights into their biases and improve their ability to generalize to
out-of-distribution scenarios? In this work, we bridge the gap between the
driving models and generative world models (Drive&Gen) to address these
questions. We propose novel statistical measures leveraging E2E drivers to
evaluate the realism of generated videos. By exploiting the controllability of
the video generation model, we conduct targeted experiments to investigate
distribution gaps affecting E2E planner performance. Finally, we show that
synthetic data produced by the video generation model offers a cost-effective
alternative to real-world data collection. This synthetic data effectively
improves E2E model generalization beyond existing Operational Design Domains,
facilitating the expansion of autonomous vehicle services into new operational
contexts.

Result: 实验结果表明，该模型能够在不改变场景内容的情况下实现优越的精细控制。

Conclusion: 该方法在推理时实现了对散焦效果的精确交互控制，这是现有扩散模型无法达到的。

Abstract: Current text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating diverse,
high-quality images, yet they struggle to incorporate fine-grained camera
metadata such as precise aperture settings. In this work, we introduce a novel
text-to-image diffusion framework that leverages camera metadata, or EXIF data,
which is often embedded in image files, with an emphasis on generating
controllable lens blur. Our method mimics the physical image formation process
by first generating an all-in-focus image, estimating its monocular depth,
predicting a plausible focus distance with a novel focus distance transformer,
and then forming a defocused image with an existing differentiable lens blur
model. Gradients flow backwards through this whole process, allowing us to
learn without explicit supervision to generate defocus effects based on content
elements and the provided EXIF data. At inference time, this enables precise
interactive user control over defocus effects while preserving scene contents,
which is not achievable with existing diffusion models. Experimental results
demonstrate that our model enables superior fine-grained control without
altering the depicted scene.

TL;DR: EgoNight是首个针对夜间自我中心视觉的综合基准，以视觉问答(VQA)为核心任务，包含3658个QA对和90个视频，揭示了现有模型在低光照条件下性能显著下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自我中心视觉基准主要关注白天场景，忽略了现实应用中不可避免的低光照条件，需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 收集合成和真实世界的昼夜对齐视频，构建EgoNight-VQA数据集，采用日增强夜自动标注引擎并通过人工验证确保质量。

Result: 评估最先进的多模态大语言模型发现，从白天到夜间的迁移性能大幅下降，凸显了低光照条件下推理的挑战。

Conclusion: EgoNight为推进应用驱动的自我中心视觉研究提供了坚实基础，有助于开发跨光照域泛化的模型。

Abstract: Most existing benchmarks for egocentric vision understanding focus primarily
on daytime scenarios, overlooking the low-light conditions that are inevitable
in real-world applications. To investigate this gap, we present EgoNight, the
first comprehensive benchmark for nighttime egocentric vision, with visual
question answering (VQA) as the core task. A key feature of EgoNight is the
introduction of day-night aligned videos, which enhance night annotation
quality using the daytime data and reveal clear performance gaps between
lighting conditions. To achieve this, we collect both synthetic videos rendered
by Blender and real-world recordings, ensuring that scenes and actions are
visually and temporally aligned. Leveraging these paired videos, we construct
EgoNight-VQA, supported by a novel day-augmented night auto-labeling engine and
refinement through extensive human verification. Each QA pair is double-checked
by annotators for reliability. In total, EgoNight-VQA contains 3658 QA pairs
across 90 videos, spanning 12 diverse QA types, with more than 300 hours of
human work. Evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) reveal substantial performance drops when transferring from day to
night, underscoring the challenges of reasoning under low-light conditions.
Beyond VQA, EgoNight also introduces two auxiliary tasks, day-night
correspondence retrieval and egocentric depth estimation at night, that further
explore the boundaries of existing models. We believe EgoNight-VQA provides a
strong foundation for advancing application-driven egocentric vision research
and for developing models that generalize across illumination domains. All the
data and code will be made available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: Human3R是一个统一的单目视频4D人体-场景重建框架，能够一次性恢复多人SMPL-X身体、3D场景和相机轨迹，无需多阶段处理或迭代优化，实现实时重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖多阶段流程、迭代优化和多种预处理（如人体检测、深度估计、SLAM），导致效率低下且复杂。Human3R旨在消除这些依赖，实现统一的前馈式重建。

Method: 基于CUT3R模型，采用参数高效的视觉提示调优技术，在保持丰富时空先验的同时直接输出多个SMPL-X身体。统一模型无需迭代优化，仅需在BEDLAM合成数据集上训练一天。

Result: 实现实时重建（15 FPS），内存占用低（8 GB），在全局人体运动估计、局部人体网格恢复、视频深度估计和相机姿态估计等任务上达到SOTA或竞争性性能。

Conclusion: Human3R作为简单而强大的基线模型，可轻松扩展到下游应用，为在线4D人体-场景重建提供了高效统一的解决方案。

Abstract: We present Human3R, a unified, feed-forward framework for online 4D
human-scene reconstruction, in the world frame, from casually captured
monocular videos. Unlike previous approaches that rely on multi-stage
pipelines, iterative contact-aware refinement between humans and scenes, and
heavy dependencies, e.g., human detection, depth estimation, and SLAM
pre-processing, Human3R jointly recovers global multi-person SMPL-X bodies
("everyone"), dense 3D scene ("everywhere"), and camera trajectories in a
single forward pass ("all-at-once"). Our method builds upon the 4D online
reconstruction model CUT3R, and uses parameter-efficient visual prompt tuning,
to strive to preserve CUT3R's rich spatiotemporal priors, while enabling direct
readout of multiple SMPL-X bodies. Human3R is a unified model that eliminates
heavy dependencies and iterative refinement. After being trained on the
relatively small-scale synthetic dataset BEDLAM for just one day on one GPU, it
achieves superior performance with remarkable efficiency: it reconstructs
multiple humans in a one-shot manner, along with 3D scenes, in one stage, at
real-time speed (15 FPS) with a low memory footprint (8 GB). Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Human3R delivers state-of-the-art or competitive
performance across tasks, including global human motion estimation, local human
mesh recovery, video depth estimation, and camera pose estimation, with a
single unified model. We hope that Human3R will serve as a simple yet strong
baseline, be easily extended for downstream applications.Code available in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着TTI模型在内容创作中的影响力增加，需要评估它们准确呈现历史背景的能力，而现有研究主要关注人口统计和文化偏见，历史准确性方面研究不足。

Method: 开发了HistVis数据集，包含30,000张由三种最先进扩散模型生成的合成图像，使用精心设计的提示词描绘不同历史时期的普遍人类活动，从三个维度评估：隐含风格关联、历史一致性和人口统计表示。

Result: 发现TTI模型在历史主题图像生成中存在系统性不准确，经常通过融入未说明的风格线索来刻板化过去时代，引入时代错误，且未能反映合理的人口统计模式。

Conclusion: 通过提供可扩展的方法和基准来评估生成图像中的历史表现，这项工作为构建更准确和文化对齐的TTI模型迈出了初步步骤。

Abstract: As Text-to-Image (TTI) diffusion models become increasingly influential in
content creation, growing attention is being directed toward their societal and
cultural implications. While prior research has primarily examined demographic
and cultural biases, the ability of these models to accurately represent
historical contexts remains largely underexplored. In this work, we present a
systematic and reproducible methodology for evaluating how TTI systems depict
different historical periods. For this purpose, we introduce the HistVis
dataset, a curated collection of 30,000 synthetic images generated by three
state-of-the-art diffusion models using carefully designed prompts depicting
universal human activities across different historical periods. We evaluate
generated imagery across three key aspects: (1) Implicit Stylistic
Associations: examining default visual styles associated with specific eras;
(2) Historical Consistency: identifying anachronisms such as modern artifacts
in pre-modern contexts; and (3) Demographic Representation: comparing generated
racial and gender distributions against historically plausible baselines. Our
findings reveal systematic inaccuracies in historically themed generated
imagery, as TTI models frequently stereotype past eras by incorporating
unstated stylistic cues, introduce anachronisms, and fail to reflect plausible
demographic patterns. By offering a scalable methodology and benchmark for
assessing historical representation in generated imagery, this work provides an
initial step toward building more historically accurate and culturally aligned
TTI models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EFX是一种重要的公平分配概念，但此类分配是否始终存在仍是公平分配领域的重大开放问题。

Method: 使用模拟退火算法，以EFX违反总数作为目标函数，结合单转移邻域结构在分配空间中移动。

Result: 算法在所有测试实例中都找到了EFX分配，包括数千个随机生成的输入，并能扩展到数百代理和/或数千物品的设置。

Conclusion: 该算法简单且性能强大，为未来方法评估提供了基准。理论方面为相同加性估值提供了势函数，确保在单转移邻域下的严格下降过程会终止于EFX分配。

Abstract: We present a simple local search algorithm for computing EFX (envy-free up to
any good) allocations of $m$ indivisible goods among $n$ agents with additive
valuations. EFX is a compelling fairness notion, and whether such allocations
always exist remains a major open question in fair division.
  Our algorithm employs simulated annealing with the total number of EFX
violations as an objective function together with a single-transfer
neighborhood structure to move through the space of allocations. It found an
EFX allocation in all the instances tested, which included thousands of
randomly generated inputs, and scaled to settings with hundreds of agents
and/or thousands of items. The algorithm's simplicity, along with its strong
empirical performance makes it a simple benchmark for evaluating future
approaches.
  On the theoretical side, we provide a potential function for identical
additive valuations, which ensures that any strict-descent procedure under the
single-transfer neighborhood ends at an EFX allocation. This represents an
alternative proof of existence for identical valuations.

Conclusion: 该研究为带约束的租金分配问题提供了统一的算法框架，推进了公平分配方法在现实世界平台中的实际应用。

Abstract: We study the classical rent division problem, where $n$ agents must allocate
$n$ indivisible rooms and split a fixed total rent $R$. The goal is to compute
an envy-free (EF) allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's room and
rent to their own. This problem has been extensively studied under standard
assumptions, where efficient algorithms for computing EF allocations are known.
  We extend this framework by introducing two practically motivated
constraints: (i) lower and upper bounds on room rents, and (ii) room-specific
budget for agents. We develop efficient combinatorial algorithms that either
compute a feasible EF allocation or certify infeasibility.
  We further design algorithms to optimize over EF allocations using natural
fairness objectives such as maximin utility, leximin utility, and minimum
utility spread. Our approach unifies both constraint types within a single
algorithmic framework, advancing the applicability of fair division methods in
real-world platforms such as Spliddit.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统匹配机制使用总距离作为成本度量，可能导致不公平结果，少数代理承担大部分成本。因此需要研究在最大成本目标下的度量失真问题。

Method: 使用RepMatch机制的变体，分析其在最大成本目标下的性能，并与总成本目标进行比较。

Result: RepMatch机制在最大成本目标下的失真度从总成本目标的O(n²)改善到O(n¹·⁵⁸)，并且对所有单调对称范数公平目标都能保证O(n²)失真度。

Conclusion: 最大成本目标能显著改善匹配机制的公平性，RepMatch机制在不同公平目标下都表现出良好的性能保证。

Abstract: We consider the matching problem in the metric distortion framework. There
are $n$ agents and $n$ items occupying points in a shared metric space, and the
goal is to design a matching mechanism that outputs a low-cost matching between
the agents and items, using only agents' ordinal rankings of the candidates by
distance. A mechanism has distortion $\alpha$ if it always outputs a matching
whose cost is within a factor of $\alpha$ of the optimum, in every instance
regardless of the metric space.
  Typically, the cost of a matching is measured in terms of the total distance
between matched agents and items, but this measure can incentivize unfair
outcomes where a handful of agents bear the brunt of the cost. With this in
mind, we consider how the metric distortion problem changes when the cost is
instead measured in terms of the maximum cost of any agent. We show that while
these two notions of distortion can in general differ by a factor of $n$, the
distortion of a variant of the state-of-the-art mechanism, RepMatch, actually
improves from $O(n^2)$ under the sum objective to $O(n^{1.58})$ under the max
objective. We also show that for any fairness objective defined by a monotone
symmetric norm, this algorithm guarantees distortion $O(n^2)$.

Abstract: Myerson's seminal characterization of the revenue-optimal auction for a
single item \cite{myerson1981optimal} remains a cornerstone of mechanism
design. However, generalizing this framework to multi-item settings has proven
exceptionally challenging. Even under restrictive assumptions, closed-form
characterizations of optimal mechanisms are rare and are largely confined to
the single-agent case \cite{pavlov2011optimal,hart2017approximate,
daskalakis2018transport, GIANNAKOPOULOS2018432}, departing from the two-item
setting only when prior distributions are uniformly distributed
\cite{manelli2006bundling, daskalakis2017strong,giannakopoulos2018sjm}. In this
work, we build upon the bi-valued setting introduced by Yao
\cite{YAO_BIC_DSIC}, where each item's value has support 2 and lies in $\{a,
b\}$. Yao's result provides the only known closed-form optimal mechanism for
multiple agents. We extend this line of work along three natural axes,
establishing the first closed-form optimal mechanisms in each of the following
settings: (i) $n$ i.i.d. agents and $m$ i.i.d. items (ii) $n$ non-i.i.d. agents
and two i.i.d. items and (iii) $n$ i.i.d. agents and two non-i.i.d. items. Our
results lie at the limit of what is considered possible, since even with a
single agent and m bi-valued non-i.i.d. items, finding the optimal mechanism is
$\#P$-Hard \cite{daskalakis2014complexity, xi2018soda}. We finally generalize
the discrete analog of a result from~\cite{daskalakis2017strong}, showing that
for a single agent with $m$ items drawn from arbitrary (non-identical) discrete
distributions, grand bundling is optimal when all item values are sufficiently
large. We further show that for any continuous product distribution, grand
bundling achieves $\mathrm{OPT} - \epsilon$ revenue for large enough values.

Conclusion: 数字合约不仅可作为技术工具，还能作为促进透明度、问责制和韧性的制度工具，在供应链、物流、能源市场等高价值资源分配中具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Decentralized coordination and digital contracting are becoming critical in
complex industrial ecosystems, yet existing approaches often rely on ad hoc
heuristics or purely technical blockchain implementations without a rigorous
economic foundation. This study develops a mechanism design framework for smart
contract-based resource allocation that explicitly embeds efficiency and
fairness in decentralized coordination. We establish the existence and
uniqueness of contract equilibria, extending classical results in mechanism
design, and introduce a decentralized price adjustment algorithm with provable
convergence guarantees that can be implemented in real time. To evaluate
performance, we combine extensive synthetic benchmarks with a proof-of-concept
real-world dataset (MovieLens). The synthetic tests probe robustness under fee
volatility, participation shocks, and dynamic demand, while the MovieLens case
study illustrates how the mechanism can balance efficiency and fairness in
realistic allocation environments. Results demonstrate that the proposed
mechanism achieves substantial improvements in both efficiency and equity while
remaining resilient to abrupt perturbations, confirming its stability beyond
steady state analysis. The findings highlight broad managerial and policy
relevance for supply chains, logistics, energy markets, healthcare resource
allocation, and public infrastructure, where transparent and auditable
coordination is increasingly critical. By combining theoretical rigor with
empirical validation, the study shows how digital contracts can serve not only
as technical artifacts but also as institutional instruments for transparency,
accountability, and resilience in high-stakes resource allocation.

Abstract: We generalize the concept of M\"obius inversion and Shapley values to
directed acyclic multigraphs and weighted versions thereof. We further allow
value functions (games) and thus their M\"obius transforms (synergy function)
and Shapley values to have values in any abelian group that is a module over a
ring that contains the graph weights, e.g. vector-valued functions. To achieve
this and overcome the obstruction that the classical axioms (linearity,
efficiency, null player, symmetry) are not strong enough to uniquely determine
Shapley values in this more general setting, we analyze Shapley values from two
novel points of view: 1) We introduce projection operators that allow us to
interpret Shapley values as the recursive projection and re-attribution of
higher-order synergies to lower-order ones; 2) we propose a strengthening of
the null player axiom and a localized symmetry axiom, namely the weak elements
and flat hierarchy axioms. The former allows us to remove coalitions with
vanishing synergy while preserving the rest of the hierarchical structure. The
latter treats player-coalition bonds uniformly in the corner case of
hierarchically flat graphs. Together with linearity these axioms already imply
a unique explicit formula for the Shapley values, as well as classical
properties like efficiency, null player, symmetry, and novel ones like the
projection property. This whole framework then specializes to finite inclusion
algebras, lattices, partial orders and mereologies, and also recovers certain
previously known cases as corner cases, and presents others from a new
perspective. The admission of general weighted directed acyclic multigraph
structured hierarchies and vector-valued functions and Shapley values opens up
the possibility for new analytic tools and application areas, like machine
learning, language processing, explainable artificial intelligence, and many
more.

Motivation: 研究区块链交易费机制对矿工和用户合谋的鲁棒性，探索不同规模合谋（c-SCP）之间的关系。

Method: 在相对较弱的假设（一致平局处理）下，通过理论分析证明2-SCP与c-SCP（c≥2）的等价性。

Result: 发现2-SCP机制类与任意c≥2的c-SCP机制类相同，表明合谋脆弱性具有尺度不变性。

Conclusion: 任何易受合谋攻击的交易费机制也易受小型合谋攻击，这对区块链机制设计具有重要意义。

Abstract: Transaction Fee Mechanisms (TFMs) study auction design in the Blockchain
context, and emphasize robustness against miner and user collusion, moreso than
traditional auction theory. \cite{chung2023foundations} introduce the notion of
a mechanism being $c$-Side-Contract-Proof ($c$-SCP), i.e., robust to a
collusion of the miner and $c$ users. Later work
\cite{chung2024collusion,welfareIncreasingCollusion} shows a gap between the
$1$-SCP and $2$-SCP classes. We show that the class of $2$-SCP mechanisms
equals that of any $c$-SCP with $c\geq 2$, under a relatively minor assumption
of consistent tie-breaking. In essence, this implies that any mechanism
vulnerable to collusion, is also vulnerable to a small collusion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音风格转换方法缺乏理论基础，无法保证可靠和可解释的控制，需要建立理论框架来确保属性转换的可靠性。

Method: 基于非概率自编码器架构，在预测的潜在变量和目标可控变量之间施加独立性约束，确保在保留原始内容的同时修改目标属性。

Result: 在说话人身份和情感等语音风格转换任务上验证了方法的有效性，定量评估证实了该方法的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: 该框架为语音属性转换提供了理论保证，实现了可靠可控的风格转换，同时保持了内容的完整性。

Abstract: While signal conversion and disentangled representation learning have shown
promise for manipulating data attributes across domains such as audio, image,
and multimodal generation, existing approaches, especially for speech style
conversion, are largely empirical and lack rigorous theoretical foundations to
guarantee reliable and interpretable control. In this work, we propose a
general framework for speech attribute conversion, accompanied by theoretical
analysis and guarantees under reasonable assumptions. Our framework builds on a
non-probabilistic autoencoder architecture with an independence constraint
between the predicted latent variable and the target controllable variable.
This design ensures a consistent signal transformation, conditioned on an
observed style variable, while preserving the original content and modifying
the desired attribute. We further demonstrate the versatility of our method by
evaluating it on speech styles, including speaker identity and emotion.
Quantitative evaluations confirm the effectiveness and generality of the
proposed approach.

TL;DR: AUREXA-SE是一个用于音频-视觉语音增强的渐进式双模态框架，通过双向交叉注意力机制和Squeezeformer块实现音频和视觉模态的深度融合，在语音质量指标上显著优于噪声基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的音频-视觉语音增强方法需要更有效的跨模态融合机制来充分利用音频和视觉信息的互补性，以产生更清晰、更可理解的语音输出。

Method: 使用基于U-Net的1D卷积编码器处理原始音频波形，Swin Transformer V2提取视觉特征，通过新颖的双向交叉注意力机制进行深度上下文融合，采用轻量级Squeezeformer块捕获时序依赖，最后通过U-Net风格解码器重建波形。

Result: 在实验中显著优于噪声基线，STOI达到0.516，PESQ达到1.323，SI-SDR达到-4.322 dB。

Conclusion: AUREXA-SE通过有效的跨模态融合和时序建模，在音频-视觉语音增强任务中取得了显著性能提升，证明了该框架的有效性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose AUREXA-SE (Audio-Visual Unified Representation
Exchange Architecture with Cross-Attention and Squeezeformer for Speech
Enhancement), a progressive bimodal framework tailored for audio-visual speech
enhancement (AVSE). AUREXA-SE jointly leverages raw audio waveforms and visual
cues by employing a U-Net-based 1D convolutional encoder for audio and a Swin
Transformer V2 for efficient and expressive visual feature extraction. Central
to the architecture is a novel bidirectional cross-attention mechanism, which
facilitates deep contextual fusion between modalities, enabling rich and
complementary representation learning. To capture temporal dependencies within
the fused embeddings, a stack of lightweight Squeezeformer blocks combining
convolutional and attention modules is introduced. The enhanced embeddings are
then decoded via a U-Net-style decoder for direct waveform reconstruction,
ensuring perceptually consistent and intelligible speech output. Experimental
evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of AUREXA-SE, achieving significant
performance improvements over noisy baselines, with STOI of 0.516, PESQ of
1.323, and SI-SDR of -4.322 dB. The source code of AUREXA-SE is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统音频语言模型在声音识别方面表现出色，但单通道输入从根本上限制了空间理解能力。需要开发能够理解空间音频场景的模型。

Method: 使用双空间和频谱编码器，从4000多小时合成一阶Ambisonics录音中学习，能够一次性枚举和描述多达四个定向声源，以及非定向背景声音和房间特性。

Result: 模型在15个指标上评估，涵盖内容、位置、时间、响度和混响，在真实房间脉冲响应上具有良好的泛化能力，性能仅有轻微下降。

Conclusion: 这是第一个能够完整描述空间场景的音频大语言模型，具有强大的实际部署潜力。

Abstract: Acoustic scene perception involves describing the type of sounds, their
timing, their direction and distance, as well as their loudness and
reverberation. While audio language models excel in sound recognition,
single-channel input fundamentally limits spatial understanding. This work
presents Sci-Phi, a spatial audio large language model with dual spatial and
spectral encoders that estimates a complete parameter set for all sound sources
and the surrounding environment. Learning from over 4,000 hours of synthetic
first-order Ambisonics recordings including metadata, Sci-Phi enumerates and
describes up to four directional sound sources in one pass, alongside
non-directional background sounds and room characteristics. We evaluate the
model with a permutation-invariant protocol and 15 metrics covering content,
location, timing, loudness, and reverberation, and analyze its robustness
across source counts, signal-to-noise ratios, reverberation levels, and
challenging mixtures of acoustically, spatially, or temporally similar sources.
Notably, Sci-Phi generalizes to real room impulse responses with only minor
performance degradation. Overall, this work establishes the first audio LLM
capable of full spatial-scene description, with strong potential for real-world
deployment. Demo: https://sci-phi-audio.github.io/demo

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于稀疏表示的深度伪造语音检测方法，通过在AASIST检测架构的最后一层嵌入中使用TopK激活，实现了95%稀疏度下23.36%的等错误率，并展示了更好的特征解耦能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语音合成技术的快速发展，深度伪造检测成为重要任务。系统不仅需要高效和鲁棒，还需要提供可解释性。论文关注潜在表示的解释性，特别是通过稀疏表示来提高检测性能和可解释性。

Method: 在AASIST深度伪造检测架构的最后一层嵌入中，使用受稀疏自编码器启发的TopK激活方法，获得稀疏表示用于决策过程。

Result: 在ASVSpoof5测试集上实现了23.36%的等错误率，稀疏度达到95%。基于互信息的完整性和模块性指标显示，这些表示提供了更好的特征解耦，某些攻击直接在潜在空间中被编码。

Conclusion: 稀疏深度伪造检测可以改善检测性能，同时提供更好的可解释性和特征解耦能力，使系统能够更有效地识别和解释不同类型的攻击。

Abstract: Due to the rapid progress of speech synthesis, deepfake detection has become
a major concern in the speech processing community. Because it is a critical
task, systems must not only be efficient and robust, but also provide
interpretable explanations. Among the different approaches for explainability,
we focus on the interpretation of latent representations. In such paper, we
focus on the last layer of embeddings of AASIST, a deepfake detection
architecture. We use a TopK activation inspired by SAEs on this layer to obtain
sparse representations which are used in the decision process. We demonstrate
that sparse deepfake detection can improve detection performance, with an EER
of 23.36% on ASVSpoof5 test set, with 95% of sparsity. We then show that these
representations provide better disentanglement, using completeness and
modularity metrics based on mutual information. Notably, some attacks are
directly encoded in the latent space.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: MSF-SER是一种多粒度语义融合的语音情感识别方法，通过融合局部强调语义、全局语义和扩展语义三个层次的文本语义，结合声学特征，显著提升了连续维度情感识别的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态语音情感识别方法主要依赖全局转录文本，存在两个局限：(1) 所有词语被同等对待，忽略了句子不同部分的强调会改变情感含义；(2) 仅表示表面词汇内容，缺乏更高层次的解释性线索。

Method: 提出MSF-SER方法，通过三个互补层次的文本语义（局部强调语义LES、全局语义GS、扩展语义ES）增强声学特征，采用模态内门控融合和跨模态FiLM调制的轻量级专家混合（FM-MOE）进行集成。

Result: 在MSP-Podcast和IEMOCAP数据集上的实验表明，MSF-SER在维度预测方面持续改进，证明了丰富语义融合对语音情感识别的有效性。

Conclusion: 多粒度语义融合方法能够有效克服现有方法的局限，通过整合不同层次的语义信息显著提升连续维度语音情感识别的性能。

Abstract: Continuous dimensional speech emotion recognition captures affective
variation along valence, arousal, and dominance, providing finer-grained
representations than categorical approaches. Yet most multimodal methods rely
solely on global transcripts, leading to two limitations: (1) all words are
treated equally, overlooking that emphasis on different parts of a sentence can
shift emotional meaning; (2) only surface lexical content is represented,
lacking higher-level interpretive cues. To overcome these issues, we propose
MSF-SER (Multi-granularity Semantic Fusion for Speech Emotion Recognition),
which augments acoustic features with three complementary levels of textual
semantics--Local Emphasized Semantics (LES), Global Semantics (GS), and
Extended Semantics (ES). These are integrated via an intra-modal gated fusion
and a cross-modal FiLM-modulated lightweight Mixture-of-Experts (FM-MOE).
Experiments on MSP-Podcast and IEMOCAP show that MSF-SER consistently improves
dimensional prediction, demonstrating the effectiveness of enriched semantic
fusion for SER.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 吉他等乐器的节奏模式转录研究较少，且难以客观定义"正确"的节奏模式。为创建有明确标注的数据集，作者请专家音乐家转录了410首流行歌曲的节奏模式。

Method: 1. 近似音轨分离提取吉他部分；2. 使用预训练基础模型MERT检测单个弹奏动作；3. 模式解码过程，将转录的吉他弹奏序列表示为专家策划词汇中的模式。

Result: 研究表明可以在多音轨音乐中相当准确地转录吉他轨道的节奏模式，产生包含自动检测小节线和拍号标记的人类可读表示。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效转录吉他节奏模式，并通过消融研究和误差分析验证了其准确性，提出了评估预测节奏模式序列准确性和可读性的指标。

Abstract: Whereas chord transcription has received considerable attention during the
past couple of decades, far less work has been devoted to transcribing and
encoding the rhythmic patterns that occur in a song. The topic is especially
relevant for instruments such as the rhythm guitar, which is typically played
by strumming rhythmic patterns that repeat and vary over time. However, in many
cases one cannot objectively define a single "right" rhythmic pattern for a
given song section. To create a dataset with well-defined ground-truth labels,
we asked expert musicians to transcribe the rhythmic patterns in 410 popular
songs and record cover versions where the guitar tracks followed those
transcriptions. To transcribe the strums and their corresponding rhythmic
patterns, we propose a three-step framework. Firstly, we perform approximate
stem separation to extract the guitar part from the polyphonic mixture.
Secondly, we detect individual strums within the separated guitar audio, using
a pre-trained foundation model (MERT) as a backbone. Finally, we carry out a
pattern-decoding process in which the transcribed sequence of guitar strums is
represented by patterns drawn from an expert-curated vocabulary. We show that
it is possible to transcribe the rhythmic patterns of the guitar track in
polyphonic music with quite high accuracy, producing a representation that is
human-readable and includes automatically detected bar lines and time signature
markers. We perform ablation studies and error analysis and propose a set of
evaluation metrics to assess the accuracy and readability of the predicted
rhythmic pattern sequence.

TL;DR: EMORL-TTS是一个基于强化学习的细粒度情感可控TTS框架，通过在VAD空间中统一全局强度控制和局部重音调节，结合监督微调和任务特定奖励的强化学习，实现了更好的情感准确性、强度区分和重音清晰度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于LLM的TTS系统虽然质量好且具有零样本能力，但由于依赖离散语音标记，缺乏细粒度的情感控制。现有方法要么将情感限制为分类标签，要么无法推广到基于LLM的架构。

Method: 提出EMORL-TTS框架，在VAD空间中统一全局强度控制和局部重音调节，结合监督微调和针对情感类别、强度和重音的任务特定奖励的强化学习。

Result: 实验表明，EMORL-TTS提高了情感准确性、强度区分和重音清晰度，同时保持了与强LLM基线相当的合成质量。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了细粒度的情感控制，并进一步研究了重音放置如何调节细粒度情感强度。

Abstract: Recent LLM-based TTS systems achieve strong quality and zero-shot ability,
but lack fine-grained emotional control due to their reliance on discrete
speech tokens. Existing approaches either limit emotions to categorical labels
or cannot generalize to LLM-based architectures. We propose EMORL-TTS
(Fine-grained Emotion-controllable TTS with Reinforcement Learning), a
framework that unifies global intensity control in the VAD space with local
emphasis regulation. Our method combines supervised fine-tuning with
reinforcement learning guided by task-specific rewards for emotion category,
intensity, and emphasis. Moreover, we further investigate how emphasis
placement modulates fine-grained emotion intensity. Experiments show that
EMORL-TTS improves emotion accuracy, intensity differentiation, and emphasis
clarity, while preserving synthesis quality comparable to strong LLM-based
baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注时间同步，而视频对齐音频生成在空间对齐方面仍相对未被探索，需要开发能够同时实现时间和空间对齐的音频生成模型。

Method: 利用预训练基础模型，通过深度图和边界框提取空间线索，将其作为扩散音频生成模型中的交叉注意力条件，实现时空对齐的立体音频生成。

Result: 在Walking The Maps数据集上的实验表明，StereoSync能够同时实现时间和空间对齐，在视频到音频生成方面推进了技术前沿，显著提升了沉浸感和真实感。

Conclusion: StereoSync通过引入空间感知机制，超越了简单的时间同步，为视频对齐音频生成提供了更全面和沉浸式的解决方案。

Abstract: Although audio generation has been widely studied over recent years,
video-aligned audio generation still remains a relatively unexplored frontier.
To address this gap, we introduce StereoSync, a novel and efficient model
designed to generate audio that is both temporally synchronized with a
reference video and spatially aligned with its visual context. Moreover,
StereoSync also achieves efficiency by leveraging pretrained foundation models,
reducing the need for extensive training while maintaining high-quality
synthesis. Unlike existing methods that primarily focus on temporal
synchronization, StereoSync introduces a significant advancement by
incorporating spatial awareness into video-aligned audio generation. Indeed,
given an input video, our approach extracts spatial cues from depth maps and
bounding boxes, using them as cross-attention conditioning in a diffusion-based
audio generation model. Such an approach allows StereoSync to go beyond simple
synchronization, producing stereo audio that dynamically adapts to the spatial
structure and movement of a video scene. We evaluate StereoSync on Walking The
Maps, a curated dataset comprising videos from video games that feature
animated characters walking through diverse environments. Experimental results
demonstrate the ability of StereoSync to achieve both temporal and spatial
alignment, advancing the state of the art in video-to-audio generation and
resulting in a significantly more immersive and realistic audio experience.

Abstract: In this work, we present FoleyGRAM, a novel approach to video-to-audio
generation that emphasizes semantic conditioning through the use of aligned
multimodal encoders. Building on prior advancements in video-to-audio
generation, FoleyGRAM leverages the Gramian Representation Alignment Measure
(GRAM) to align embeddings across video, text, and audio modalities, enabling
precise semantic control over the audio generation process. The core of
FoleyGRAM is a diffusion-based audio synthesis model conditioned on
GRAM-aligned embeddings and waveform envelopes, ensuring both semantic richness
and temporal alignment with the corresponding input video. We evaluate
FoleyGRAM on the Greatest Hits dataset, a standard benchmark for video-to-audio
models. Our experiments demonstrate that aligning multimodal encoders using
GRAM enhances the system's ability to semantically align generated audio with
video content, advancing the state of the art in video-to-audio synthesis.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-music models have enabled coherent music

Furthermore, we establish a benchmark with a curated test set and a robust
Emotion Predictor, facilitating objective evaluation of emotional
controllability in music generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that

Conclusion: SFS模型为符号化全歌曲生成提供了一种有效的方法，支持灵活的人机协作音乐创作流程。

Abstract: We propose the Segmented Full-Song Model (SFS) for symbolic full-song
generation. The model accepts a user-provided song structure and an optional
short seed segment that anchors the main idea around which the song is
developed. By factorizing a song into segments and generating each one through
selective attention to related segments, the model achieves higher quality and
efficiency compared to prior work. To demonstrate its suitability for human-AI
interaction, we further wrap SFS into a web application that enables users to
iteratively co-create music on a piano roll with customizable structures and
flexible ordering.

### [94] [ECTSpeech: Enhancing Efficient Speech Synthesis via Easy Consistency Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05984)
*Tao Zhu,Yinfeng Yu,Liejun Wang,Fuchun Sun,Wendong Zheng*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: ECTSpeech是一个简单有效的一步语音合成框架，首次将Easy Consistency Tuning策略应用于语音合成，通过渐进式收紧一致性约束实现高质量单步生成，显著降低训练复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在语音合成中表现出色，但需要多步采样导致推理效率低。现有的一致性模型方法需要额外训练成本且依赖预训练教师模型的性能。

Method: 在预训练扩散模型上渐进式收紧一致性约束，并设计了多尺度门控模块(MSGate)来增强去噪器在不同尺度特征融合的能力。

Result: 在LJSpeech数据集上的实验表明，ECTSpeech在单步采样下实现了与最先进方法相当的音频质量，同时大幅降低了训练成本和复杂度。

Conclusion: ECTSpeech成功将ECT策略引入语音合成，实现了高质量的一步生成，显著提升了训练效率，为高效语音合成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in speech
synthesis, but typically require multi-step sampling, resulting in low
inference efficiency. Recent studies address this issue by distilling diffusion
models into consistency models, enabling efficient one-step generation.
However, these approaches introduce additional training costs and rely heavily
on the performance of pre-trained teacher models. In this paper, we propose
ECTSpeech, a simple and effective one-step speech synthesis framework that, for
the first time, incorporates the Easy Consistency Tuning (ECT) strategy into
speech synthesis. By progressively tightening consistency constraints on a
pre-trained diffusion model, ECTSpeech achieves high-quality one-step
generation while significantly reducing training complexity. In addition, we
design a multi-scale gate module (MSGate) to enhance the denoiser's ability to
fuse features at different scales. Experimental results on the LJSpeech dataset
demonstrate that ECTSpeech achieves audio quality comparable to
state-of-the-art methods under single-step sampling, while substantially
reducing the model's training cost and complexity.

TL;DR: EmoHRNet是基于高分辨率网络(HRNet)的语音情感识别模型，通过将音频转换为频谱图并保持高分辨率表示，在多个数据集上取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音情感识别对于提升人机交互体验至关重要，需要能够同时捕捉细粒度和整体情感线索的有效模型。

Method: 将音频样本转换为频谱图，采用HRNet架构在整个网络中保持高分辨率表示，提取高级特征。

Result: 在RAVDESS数据集上达到92.45%准确率，IEMOCAP上80.06%，EMOVO上92.77%，超越了现有领先模型。

Conclusion: EmoHRNet在语音情感识别领域设立了新的基准，证明了高分辨率表示在情感识别中的有效性。

Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) is pivotal for enhancing human-machine
interactions. This paper introduces "EmoHRNet", a novel adaptation of
High-Resolution Networks (HRNet) tailored for SER. The HRNet structure is
designed to maintain high-resolution representations from the initial to the
final layers. By transforming audio samples into spectrograms, EmoHRNet
leverages the HRNet architecture to extract high-level features. EmoHRNet's
unique architecture maintains high-resolution representations throughout,
capturing both granular and overarching emotional cues from speech signals. The
model outperforms leading models, achieving accuracies of 92.45% on RAVDESS,
80.06% on IEMOCAP, and 92.77% on EMOVO. Thus, we show that EmoHRNet sets a new
benchmark in the SER domain.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于调制提取、约束控制信号参数化和可微分数字信号处理的神经声音匹配方法，用于发现声音中的调制信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有声音匹配/参数估计系统通常是不可解释的黑盒，或者预测高维帧级参数值而不考虑底层调制曲线的形状、结构和路由，难以确定用于创建声音的调制信号。

Method: 利用调制提取、约束控制信号参数化和可微分数字信号处理(DDSP)来发现声音中的调制，适用于不同的DDSP合成器架构。

Result: 在高度调制的合成和真实音频样本上证明了方法的有效性，研究了在可解释性和声音匹配准确性之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效发现声音中的调制信号，提供了代码、音频样本和VST插件形式的训练DDSP合成器。

Abstract: Modulations are a critical part of sound design and music production,
enabling the creation of complex and evolving audio. Modern synthesizers
provide envelopes, low frequency oscillators (LFOs), and more parameter
automation tools that allow users to modulate the output with ease. However,
determining the modulation signals used to create a sound is difficult, and
existing sound-matching / parameter estimation systems are often
uninterpretable black boxes or predict high-dimensional framewise parameter
values without considering the shape, structure, and routing of the underlying
modulation curves. We propose a neural sound-matching approach that leverages
modulation extraction, constrained control signal parameterizations, and
differentiable digital signal processing (DDSP) to discover the modulations
present in a sound. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on highly
modulated synthetic and real audio samples, its applicability to different DDSP
synth architectures, and investigate the trade-off it incurs between
interpretability and sound-matching accuracy. We make our code and audio
samples available and provide the trained DDSP synths in a VST plugin.

TL;DR: CLAd-VR是一个自适应VR培训系统，通过实时EEG脑电传感测量学习者的认知负荷，并据此调整制造领域任务的培训难度和指导方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VR培训系统多为静态分步教程，无法适应学习者的需求和认知负荷，而认知负荷是影响学习和长期记忆的关键因素。

Method: 系统包含VR培训模块（用于精密钻孔任务）、可穿戴EEG设备实时捕获神经活动，通过LSTM模型分类认知负荷为低/最优/高，并动态调整任务难度和提供自适应指导（语音、视觉提示、幽灵手动画）。

Result: 开发了完整的CLAd-VR系统架构，包括EEG传感硬件、实时推理模型和自适应VR界面。

Conclusion: CLAd-VR通过集成实时EEG传感和自适应算法，解决了传统VR培训系统缺乏个性化调整的问题，提升了制造行业技能培训的效果。

Abstract: With the growing need to effectively support workforce upskilling in the
manufacturing sector, virtual reality is gaining popularity as a scalable
training solution. However, most current systems are designed as static,
step-by-step tutorials and do not adapt to a learner's needs or cognitive load,
which is a critical factor in learning and longterm retention. We address this
limitation with CLAd-VR, an adaptive VR training system that integrates
realtime EEG-based sensing to measure the learner's cognitive load and adapt
instruction accordingly, specifically for domain-specific tasks in
manufacturing. The system features a VR training module for a precision
drilling task, designed with multimodal instructional elements including
animations, text, and video. Our cognitive load sensing pipeline uses a
wearable EEG device to capture the trainee's neural activity, which is
processed through an LSTM model to classify their cognitive load as low,
optimal, or high in real time. Based on these classifications, the system
dynamically adjusts task difficulty and delivers adaptive guidance using voice
guidance, visual cues, or ghost hand animations. This paper introduces CLAd-VR
system's architecture, including the EEG sensing hardware, real-time inference
model, and adaptive VR interface.

TL;DR: 比较学生与LLM作为导师和可教代理两种互动模式的体验差异，发现学习偏好和智力谦逊等构念在不同模式中有所不同


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的流行，AI辅助学习日益普及。LLM能够进行长篇自然语言交互，使其成为探索学校及大学主题的优秀资源。本研究旨在比较学生在两种不同LLM互动模式下的体验：辅导式学习和教学式学习

Method: 使用Chrysalis系统（支持AI导师和AI可教代理的LLM系统），通过36名参与者的内部主题探索性研究，分析学生在两种互动模式下的偏好和智力谦逊等构念的变化

Result: 研究揭示了学生在两种策略之间的偏好差异，以及智力谦逊等构念在不同互动模式中的变化。这是首个直接比较LLM作为导师与可教代理在多主题中效果的对比研究

Conclusion: 该研究为未来在这一领域的研究开辟了新途径，提供了关于不同LLM互动模式对学生学习体验影响的重要见解

Abstract: AI-assisted learning has seen a remarkable uptick over the last few years,
mainly due to the rise in popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs). Their
ability to hold long-form, natural language interactions with users makes them
excellent resources for exploring school- and university-level topics in a
dynamic, active manner. We compare students' experiences when interacting with
an LLM companion in two capacities: tutored learning and learning-by-teaching.
We do this using Chrysalis, an LLM-based system that we have designed to
support both AI tutors and AI teachable agents for any topic. Through a
within-subject exploratory study with 36 participants, we present insights into
student preferences between the two strategies and how constructs such as
intellectual humility vary between these two interaction modes. To our
knowledge, we are the first to conduct a direct comparison study on the effects
of using an LLM as a tutor versus as a teachable agent on multiple topics. We
hope that our work opens up new avenues for future research in this area.

*Jieyu Zhou,Aryan Roy,Sneh Gupta,Daniel Weitekamp,Christopher J. MacLellan*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种中间确认方法来解决AI代理执行多步任务时的确认问题，通过建模为最小时间调度问题，在用户偏好的确认点和减少回滚成本之间取得平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI代理通常在任务结束时才允许用户确认，执行过程中用户缺乏控制，导致单一错误可能引发级联故障，需要完全重启。而每一步都确认又会产生繁琐开销。

Method: 通过形成性研究发现了用户监控错误的CDCR模式，基于此开发了决策理论模型来确定时间效率最优的确认点位置，并在48名参与者的研究中评估该方法。

Result: 81%的参与者偏好中间确认方法而非现有系统的结束确认方法，任务完成时间减少了13.54%。

Conclusion: 中间确认方法在用户偏好和效率之间取得了良好平衡，显著提升了AI代理任务执行的用户体验和效率。

Abstract: Existing AI agents typically execute multi-step tasks autonomously and only
allow user confirmation at the end. During execution, users have little
control, making the confirm-at-end approach brittle: a single error can cascade
and force a complete restart. Confirming every step avoids such failures, but
imposes tedious overhead. Balancing excessive interruptions against costly
rollbacks remains an open challenge. We address this problem by modeling
confirmation as a minimum time scheduling problem. We conducted a formative
study with eight participants, which revealed a recurring
Confirmation-Diagnosis-Correction-Redo (CDCR) pattern in how users monitor
errors. Based on this pattern, we developed a decision-theoretic model to
determine time-efficient confirmation point placement. We then evaluated our
approach using a within-subjects study where 48 participants monitored AI
agents and repaired their mistakes while executing tasks. Results show that 81
percent of participants preferred our intermediate confirmation approach over
the confirm-at-end approach used by existing systems, and task completion time
was reduced by 13.54 percent.

TL;DR: 探索编程新手如何选择和使用多模态生成式AI工具，以及他们的选择标准，重点关注多模态交互在计算机科学教育中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI在教育中的广泛应用，现有研究主要关注文本交互工具，而多模态AI工具的发展为编程学习提供了新的可能性，需要了解学生如何选择和使用这些多模态工具。

Method: 通过16个有声思维实验，结合参与式观察和半结构化访谈，研究学生在完成编程问题时对多模态GenAI工具的选择及其选择标准。

Result: 研究发现学生根据特定需求选择不同的输入输出模态（文本、音频、图像上传、实时屏幕共享），并揭示了他们选择模态的具体标准。

Conclusion: 多模态通信是AI在教育中的未来发展方向，本研究旨在激发对学生在CS教育中与多模态GenAI交互的持续探索。

Abstract: The broad adoption of Generative AI (GenAI) is impacting Computer Science
education, and recent studies found its benefits and potential concerns when
students use it for programming learning. However, most existing explorations
focus on GenAI tools that primarily support text-to-text interaction. With
recent developments, GenAI applications have begun supporting multiple modes of
communication, known as multimodality. In this work, we explored how
undergraduate programming novices choose and work with multimodal GenAI tools,
and their criteria for choices. We selected a commercially available multimodal
GenAI platform for interaction, as it supports multiple input and output
modalities, including text, audio, image upload, and real-time screen-sharing.
Through 16 think-aloud sessions that combined participant observation with
follow-up semi-structured interviews, we investigated student modality choices
for GenAI tools when completing programming problems and the underlying
criteria for modality selections. With multimodal communication emerging as the
future of AI in education, this work aims to spark continued exploration on
understanding student interaction with multimodal GenAI in the context of CS
education.

TL;DR: Bloom是一个结合LLM健康教练聊天机器人和传统UI交互的体育活动促进应用，研究发现LLM在改变心理状态方面更有效，但两种条件都能显著增加体育活动水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作主要关注文本交互，但HCI研究表明UI交互更有效，因此开发结合LLM和UI的体育活动促进应用。

Method: 开发Bloom应用，进行红队评估创建安全基准数据集，并进行4周随机实地研究(N=54)比较LLM条件与非LLM控制条件。

Result: LLM条件参与者报告更强的活动益处信念、更多享受和更高自我同情心。两种条件都显著增加体育活动水平，使符合周推荐指南的参与者比例翻倍，但条件间无显著差异。

Conclusion: LLM在改变长期行为改变前的心态方面可能更有效，而两种方法都能成功促进体育活动。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer novel opportunities to support health
behavior change, yet existing work has narrowly focused on text-only
interactions. Building on decades of HCI research demonstrating the
effectiveness of UI-based interactions, we present Bloom, an application for
physical activity promotion that integrates an LLM-based health coaching
chatbot with established UI-based interactions. As part of Bloom's development,
we conducted a redteaming evaluation and contribute a safety benchmark dataset.
In a four-week randomized field study (N=54) comparing Bloom to a non-LLM
control, we observed important shifts in psychological outcomes: participants
in the LLM condition reported stronger beliefs that activity was beneficial,
greater enjoyment, and more self-compassion. Both conditions significantly
increased physical activity levels, doubling the proportion of participants
meeting recommended weekly guidelines, though we observed no significant
differences between conditions. Instead, our findings suggest that LLMs may be
more effective at shifting mindsets that precede longer-term behavior change.

TL;DR: 为家庭照顾者开发了一个基于心理距离理论的聊天机器人，通过适时提供反思性写作提示来改善心理健康。研究发现近端和远端条件会产生不同的反思模式，各有利弊。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 家庭照顾者通过写作改善心理健康，但固定或用户发起的写作时间往往错过最佳时机。需要基于心理距离理论设计适时干预。

Method: 对47名照顾者进行为期三周的实地研究，使用聊天机器人提供每日反思写作提示，并记录时间、空间和社会背景，收集958篇写作条目和5,412个编码片段。

Result: 发现两种反思模式：近端条件下产生详细、情感丰富、以照顾对象为中心的叙述，支持情感释放；远端条件下产生更平静、自我中心、分析性的叙述，支持客观反思和认知重评。

Conclusion: 心理距离显著影响反思性写作，提出了基于距离感知的适时自适应干预设计建议，以支持家庭照顾者的心理健康。

Abstract: Writing about personal experiences can improve well-being, but for family
caregivers, fixed or user-initiated schedules often miss the right moments.
Drawing on Construal Level Theory, we conducted a three-week field study with
47 caregivers using a chatbot that delivered daily reflective writing prompts
and captured temporal, spatial, and social contexts. We collected 958 writing
entries, resulting in 5,412 coded segments. Our Analysis revealed two
reflective modes. Under proximal conditions, participants produced detailed,
emotion-rich, and care recipient-focused narratives that supported emotional
release. Under distal conditions, they generated calmer, self-focused, and
analytic accounts that enabled objective reflection and cognitive reappraisal.
Participants described trade-offs: proximity preserved vivid detail but limited
objectivity, while distance enabled analysis but risked memory loss. This work
contributes empirical evidence of how psychological distances shape reflective
writing and proposes design implications for distance-aware Just-in-Time
Adaptive Interventions for family caregivers' mental health support.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VR移动技术种类繁多，用户难以根据自身能力选择最适合的技术，特别是对于上肢运动障碍用户。试错方法耗时且成本高。

Method: 使用机器学习技术，收集20名有和没有上肢运动障碍用户的数据，基于问卷和交互数据开发预测模型。

Result: 模型能92%准确预测用户最快的移动技术，预测时间误差在12%内；对6种移动技术按速度排序准确率达61%，预测时间误差在8%内。

Conclusion: 采用基于能力的设计方法，使系统能够适应用户能力，为VR可访问性研究做出贡献。

Abstract: There are over a hundred virtual reality (VR) locomotion techniques that
exist today, with new ones being designed as VR technology evolves. The
different ways of controlling locomotion techniques (e.g., gestures, button
inputs, body movements), along with the diversity of upper-body motor
impairments, can make it difficult for a user to know which locomotion
technique is best suited to their particular abilities. Moreover,
trial-and-error can be difficult, time-consuming, and costly. Using machine
learning techniques and data from 20 people with and without upper-body motor
impairments, we developed a modeling approach to predict a ranked list of a
user's fastest techniques based on questionnaire and interaction data. We found
that a user's fastest technique could be predicted based on interaction data
with 92% accuracy and that predicted locomotion times were within 12% of
observed times. The model we trained could also rank six locomotion techniques
based on speed with 61% accuracy and that predictions were within 8% of
observed times. Our findings contribute to growing research in VR accessibility
by taking an ability-based design approach to adapt systems to users'
abilities.

Abstract: Despite their increasing capabilities, text-to-image generative AI systems
are known to produce biased, offensive, and otherwise problematic outputs.
While recent advancements have supported testing and auditing of generative AI,
existing auditing methods still face challenges in supporting effectively
explore the vast space of AI-generated outputs in a structured way. To address
this gap, we conducted formative studies with five AI auditors and synthesized
five design goals for supporting systematic AI audits. Based on these insights,
we developed Vipera, an interactive auditing interface that employs multiple
visual cues including a scene graph to facilitate image sensemaking and inspire
auditors to explore and hierarchically organize the auditing criteria.
Additionally, Vipera leverages LLM-powered suggestions to facilitate
exploration of unexplored auditing directions. Through a controlled experiment
with 24 participants experienced in AI auditing, we demonstrate Vipera's
effectiveness in helping auditors navigate large AI output spaces and organize
their analyses while engaging with diverse criteria.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统平面屏幕研究无法捕捉真实世界大视野下的视觉枚举认知动态，需要沉浸式VR环境来研究注意力与记忆的交互。

Method: 开发沉浸式VR系统结合眼动追踪，进行两阶段实验：参与者枚举简单抽象形状或复杂真实物体，系统变化任务意图和空间布局。

Result: 任务意图是主导因素，选择性计数带来显著认知成本，真实物体的语义处理降低准确性并抑制记忆回忆，空间布局影响次要且统计不显著。

Conclusion: 真实世界枚举根本上受语义处理认知负荷限制，而不仅仅是视觉搜索机制；高认知需求下，理解所见内容的努力直接限制记忆能力。

Abstract: Humans navigate and understand complex visual environments by subconsciously
quantifying what they see, a process known as visual enumeration. However,
traditional studies using flat screens fail to capture the cognitive dynamics
of this process over the large visual fields of real-world scenes. To address
this gap, we developed an immersive virtual reality system with integrated
eye-tracking to investigate the interplay between attention and memory during
complex enumeration. We conducted a two-phase experiment where participants
enumerated scenes of either simple abstract shapes or complex real-world
objects, systematically varying the task intent (e.g., selective vs. exhaustive
counting) and the spatial layout of items. Our results reveal that task intent
is the dominant factor driving performance, with selective counting imposing a
significant cognitive cost that was dramatically amplified by stimulus
complexity. The semantic processing required for real-world objects reduced
accuracy and suppressed memory recall, while the influence of spatial layout
was secondary and statistically non-significant when a higher-order cognitive
task intent was driving the human behaviour. We conclude that real-world
enumeration is fundamentally constrained by the cognitive load of semantic
processing, not just the mechanics of visual search. Our findings demonstrate
that under high cognitive demand, the effort to understand what we are seeing
directly limits our capacity to remember it.

Conclusion: 可视化研究社区需要积极参与维护学术诚信，相关技能在未来将愈发重要

Abstract: In this essay, I argue that, while visualization research does not seem to be
directly at risk of being corrupted by the current massive wave of polluted
research, certain visualization concepts are being used in fraudulent fashions
and fields close to ours are being targeted. Worse, the society publishing our
work is overwhelmed by thousands of questionable papers that are being,
unfortunately, published. As a community, and if we want our research to remain
as good as it currently is, I argue that we should all get involved with our
variety of skills to help identify and correct the current scientific record. I
thus aim to present a few questionable practices that are worth knowing about
when reviewing for fields using visualization research, and hopefully will
never be useful when reviewing for our main venues. I also argue that our skill
set could become particularly relevant in the future and invite scholars of the
fields to try to get involved.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话行为分类法要么过于笼统，要么局限于特定领域，无法全面捕捉用户与对话AI交互中的情境化、适应性和社交实践。

Method: 通过1193个人机对话的迭代定性分析，结合理论回顾和跨情境验证，开发出经验基础的用户行为分类框架。

Result: TUNA将用户行为组织为包含信息搜索、综合、程序指导、内容创建、社交互动和元对话的三层层次结构。

Conclusion: TUNA为描述AI使用提供了系统词汇表，支持多尺度评估和跨产品政策协调，有助于设计更安全、响应性更强和可问责的对话系统。

Abstract: The growing ubiquity of conversational AI highlights the need for frameworks
that capture not only users' instrumental goals but also the situated,
adaptive, and social practices through which they achieve them. Existing
taxonomies of conversational behavior either overgeneralize, remain
domain-specific, or reduce interactions to narrow dialogue functions. To
address this gap, we introduce the Taxonomy of User Needs and Actions (TUNA),
an empirically grounded framework developed through iterative qualitative
analysis of 1193 human-AI conversations, supplemented by theoretical review and
validation across diverse contexts. TUNA organizes user actions into a
three-level hierarchy encompassing behaviors associated with information
seeking, synthesis, procedural guidance, content creation, social interaction,
and meta-conversation. By centering user agency and appropriation practices,
TUNA enables multi-scale evaluation, supports policy harmonization across
products, and provides a backbone for layering domain-specific taxonomies. This
work contributes a systematic vocabulary for describing AI use, advancing both
scholarly understanding and practical design of safer, more responsive, and
more accountable conversational systems.

Abstract: The science of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is populated by isolated

This situation probably lies in observing the wrong object of study, that is to
say, observing interfaces rather than interaction. This paper proposes an
experimental methodology, powered by a research methodology, that enables
tackling the ambition of observing interaction (rather than interfaces). These
observations are done during the treatment of applicative cases, allowing to
generate and replicate results covering various experimental conditions,
expressed from the need of end users and the evolution of technologies.
Performing these observations when developing applicative prototypes
illustrating novel technologies' utility allows, in the same time, to benefit
from an optimization of these prototypes to better accomplish end users tasks.
This paper depicts a long term research direction, from generating the initial
observations of interaction properties and their replication, to their
integration, that would then lead to exploring the possible relations existing
between those properties, to end toward the description of human-computer
interaction's physics.

*Brian Jay Tang,Kaiwen Sun,Noah T. Curran,Florian Schaub,Kang G. Shin*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了在大型语言模型(LLM)中嵌入个性化广告的可行性和效果，发现用户难以察觉广告且更偏好包含隐藏广告的回复，开发了专门用于广告服务的开源模型Phi-4-Ads。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM部署成本上升，公司探索基于广告的盈利模式，研究个性化广告在LLM中的影响。

Method: 通过179名参与者的实验，开发嵌入个性化产品广告的聊天机器人，评估广告对LLM性能的影响。

Result: 广告注入仅轻微影响LLM性能，参与者难以检测广告且更偏好含隐藏广告的回复，开发了广告数据集和Phi-4-Ads模型。

Conclusion: 个性化广告在LLM中具有可行性，用户接受度高，为LLM商业化提供了新的盈利途径。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the creation of
highly effective chatbots. However, the compute costs of widely deploying LLMs
have raised questions about profitability. Companies have proposed exploring
ad-based revenue streams for monetizing LLMs, which could serve as the new de
facto platform for advertising. This paper investigates the implications of
personalizing LLM advertisements to individual users via a between-subjects
experiment with 179 participants. We developed a chatbot that embeds
personalized product advertisements within LLM responses, inspired by similar
forays by AI companies. The evaluation of our benchmarks showed that ad
injection only slightly impacted LLM performance, particularly response
desirability. Results revealed that participants struggled to detect ads, and
even preferred LLM responses with hidden advertisements. Rather than clicking
on our advertising disclosure, participants tried changing their advertising
settings using natural language queries. We created an advertising dataset and
an open-source LLM, Phi-4-Ads, fine-tuned to serve ads and flexibly adapt to
user preferences.

### [110] [Lang-PINN: From Language to Physics-Informed Neural Networks via a Multi-Agent Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05158)
*Xin He,Liangliang You,Hongduan Tian,Bo Han,Ivor Tsang,Yew-Soon Ong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Lang-PINN是一个基于大语言模型的多智能体系统，能够直接从自然语言任务描述构建可训练的物理信息神经网络(PINNs)，显著降低了PINN构建的复杂性和错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的PINN构建过程劳动密集且容易出错，科学家需要将问题解释为PDE公式、设计架构和损失函数，并实现稳定的训练流程。现有LLM方法只解决孤立步骤，缺乏端到端的视角。

Method: Lang-PINN协调四个互补智能体：PDE智能体将任务描述解析为符号PDE，PINN智能体选择架构，代码智能体生成模块化实现，反馈智能体执行并诊断错误进行迭代优化。

Result: 实验显示Lang-PINN比竞争基线显著降低了误差并提高了鲁棒性：均方误差降低了3-5个数量级，端到端执行成功率提高了50%以上，时间开销减少了74%。

Conclusion: Lang-PINN能够将非正式任务陈述转化为可执行且可验证的PINN代码，为PINN构建提供了有效的端到端解决方案。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) provide a powerful approach for
solving partial differential equations (PDEs), but constructing a usable PINN
remains labor-intensive and error-prone. Scientists must interpret problems as
PDE formulations, design architectures and loss functions, and implement stable
training pipelines. Existing large language model (LLM) based approaches
address isolated steps such as code generation or architecture suggestion, but
typically assume a formal PDE is already specified and therefore lack an
end-to-end perspective. We present Lang-PINN, an LLM-driven multi-agent system
that builds trainable PINNs directly from natural language task descriptions.
Lang-PINN coordinates four complementary agents: a PDE Agent that parses task
descriptions into symbolic PDEs, a PINN Agent that selects architectures, a
Code Agent that generates modular implementations, and a Feedback Agent that
executes and diagnoses errors for iterative refinement. This design transforms
informal task statements into executable and verifiable PINN code. Experiments
show that Lang-PINN achieves substantially lower errors and greater robustness
than competitive baselines: mean squared error (MSE) is reduced by up to 3--5
orders of magnitude, end-to-end execution success improves by more than 50\%,
and reduces time overhead by up to 74\%.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文通过信息论分析揭示了系统提示中规则编码对注意力机制和合规行为的影响，发现了锚点冗余与注意力熵之间的基本权衡，并提出了动态规则验证架构来提高合规输出的概率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计基于大语言模型的安全关键智能体需要超越简单的提示工程，需要理解规则编码如何影响注意力机制和合规行为，以保护智能体免受提示注入攻击。

Method: 采用信息论分析多种注意力架构（因果、双向、局部稀疏、核化、交叉注意力），分析规则格式的句法熵和锚点集中度对注意力熵和指针保真度的影响，结合动态规则验证架构。

Result: 发现低句法熵和高集中锚点的规则格式能降低注意力熵并提高指针保真度，但存在锚点冗余与注意力熵的基本权衡；动态规则验证架构能渐进提高合规输出的概率。

Conclusion: 强调需要原则性的锚点设计和双重执行机制，以在保护LLM智能体免受提示注入攻击的同时，在演进领域中保持合规性。

Abstract: The design of safety-critical agents based on large language models (LLMs)
requires more than simple prompt engineering. This paper presents a
comprehensive information-theoretic analysis of how rule encodings in system
prompts influence attention mechanisms and compliance behaviour. We demonstrate
that rule formats with low syntactic entropy and highly concentrated anchors
reduce attention entropy and improve pointer fidelity, but reveal a fundamental
trade-off between anchor redundancy and attention entropy that previous work
failed to recognize. Through formal analysis of multiple attention
architectures including causal, bidirectional, local sparse, kernelized, and
cross-attention mechanisms, we establish bounds on pointer fidelity and show
how anchor placement strategies must account for competing fidelity and entropy
objectives. Combining these insights with a dynamic rule verification
architecture, we provide a formal proof that hot reloading of verified rule
sets increases the asymptotic probability of compliant outputs. These findings
underscore the necessity of principled anchor design and dual enforcement
mechanisms to protect LLM-based agents against prompt injection attacks while
maintaining compliance in evolving domains.

TL;DR: AgentFlow是一个可训练的在线智能体框架，通过四个模块（规划器、执行器、验证器、生成器）和演进内存协调工作，在交互环境中直接优化规划器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具增强方法训练单一整体策略，在长视野和多样化工具下扩展性差，对新场景泛化能力弱。智能体系统通过模块化分解工作提供有前景的替代方案。

Method: 提出AgentFlow框架和Flow-GRPO训练方法，将多轮优化转化为可处理的单轮策略更新，通过组归一化优势稳定学习。

Result: 在10个基准测试中，使用7B规模骨干的AgentFlow在搜索、智能体、数学和科学任务上分别获得14.9%、14.0%、14.5%和4.1%的平均准确率提升，甚至超过GPT-4o等大型专有模型。

Conclusion: 在线优化带来改进的规划能力、增强的工具调用可靠性，以及模型规模和推理轮数的正向扩展效应。

Abstract: Outcome-driven reinforcement learning has advanced reasoning in large
language models (LLMs), but prevailing tool-augmented approaches train a
single, monolithic policy that interleaves thoughts and tool calls under full
context; this scales poorly with long horizons and diverse tools and
generalizes weakly to new scenarios. Agentic systems offer a promising
alternative by decomposing work across specialized modules, yet most remain
training-free or rely on offline training decoupled from the live dynamics of
multi-turn interaction. We introduce AgentFlow, a trainable, in-the-flow
agentic framework that coordinates four modules (planner, executor, verifier,
generator) through an evolving memory and directly optimizes its planner inside
the multi-turn loop. To train on-policy in live environments, we propose
Flow-based Group Refined Policy Optimization (Flow-GRPO), which tackles
long-horizon, sparse-reward credit assignment by converting multi-turn
optimization into a sequence of tractable single-turn policy updates. It
broadcasts a single, verifiable trajectory-level outcome to every turn to align
local planner decisions with global success and stabilizes learning with
group-normalized advantages. Across ten benchmarks, AgentFlow with a 7B-scale
backbone outperforms top-performing baselines with average accuracy gains of
14.9% on search, 14.0% on agentic, 14.5% on mathematical, and 4.1% on
scientific tasks, even surpassing larger proprietary models like GPT-4o.
Further analyses confirm the benefits of in-the-flow optimization, showing
improved planning, enhanced tool-calling reliability, and positive scaling with
model size and reasoning turns.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SCL是一种将推理、记忆和控制分离的架构，相比现有框架在任务成功率、目标保真度和减少冗余调用方面表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM框架将推理、记忆和控制混合在单一提示中，导致连贯性和可预测性降低，需要更清晰的架构来支持多步骤任务。

Method: 提出结构化认知循环(SCL)架构：语言模型专用于推理，外部维护记忆，轻量级控制器在目标导向循环中指导执行。

Result: 在360个测试场景中，SCL任务成功率86.3%，优于基线(70-77%)，目标保真度更高，冗余调用更少，中间状态重用更可靠。

Conclusion: 架构分离可以在不依赖更大模型或更重提示的情况下提高可靠性和可追溯性，为扩展研究提供了基础。

Abstract: Large language models have advanced natural language understanding and
generation, yet their use as autonomous agents raises architectural challenges
for multi-step tasks. Existing frameworks often intertwine inference, memory,
and control in a single prompt, which can reduce coherence and predictability.
The Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) is introduced as an alternative
architecture that separates these functions. In SCL, the language model is
dedicated to inference, memory is maintained externally, and execution is
guided by a lightweight controller within a goal-directed loop. This design
offloads cognitive load from the model and allows intermediate results to be
stored, revisited, and checked before actions are taken, providing a clearer
basis for traceability and evaluation.
  We evaluate SCL against prompt-based baselines including ReAct and common
LangChain agents across three scenarios: temperature-based travel planning,
email drafting with conditional send, and constraint-guided image generation.
All systems share the same base model and tools under matched decoding
settings. Across 360 episodes, SCL shows modest but consistent improvements.
Task success averages 86.3 percent compared with 70-77 percent for baselines.
Goal fidelity is higher, redundant calls are fewer, intermediate states are
reused more reliably, and unsupported assertions per 100 tool calls are
reduced. Ablations show that external memory and control each contribute
independently, and decoding sweeps confirm stability of the effects.
  These results suggest that architectural separation can improve reliability
and traceability without relying on larger models or heavier prompts. The
findings are preliminary and intended to guide extended studies with additional
models, longer horizons, multimodal tasks, and collaborative settings.

TL;DR: SAC-Opt是一个基于语义锚点的后向引导修正框架，通过将原始语义锚点与生成代码重构的锚点对齐，选择性修正不匹配组件，提高LLM生成优化模型的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM生成优化模型的方法主要依赖求解器驱动，存在语义错误未被检测的问题，导致生成语法正确但逻辑错误的模型。

Method: 提出SAC-Opt框架，使用语义锚点进行后向引导修正，通过对齐原始和重构的语义锚点，选择性修正不匹配的约束和目标逻辑组件。

Result: 在7个公共数据集上的实验表明，SAC-Opt将平均建模准确率提高了7.8%，在ComplexLP数据集上最高提升21.9%。

Conclusion: 语义锚点修正在基于LLM的优化工作流中至关重要，能够确保从问题意图到求解器可执行代码的忠实转换。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have opened new paradigms in optimization
modeling by enabling the generation of executable solver code from natural
language descriptions. Despite this promise, existing approaches typically
remain solver-driven: they rely on single-pass forward generation and apply
limited post-hoc fixes based on solver error messages, leaving undetected
semantic errors that silently produce syntactically correct but logically
flawed models. To address this challenge, we propose SAC-Opt, a backward-guided
correction framework that grounds optimization modeling in problem semantics
rather than solver feedback. At each step, SAC-Opt aligns the original semantic
anchors with those reconstructed from the generated code and selectively
corrects only the mismatched components, driving convergence toward a
semantically faithful model. This anchor-driven correction enables fine-grained
refinement of constraint and objective logic, enhancing both fidelity and
robustness without requiring additional training or supervision. Empirical
results on seven public datasets demonstrate that SAC-Opt improves average
modeling accuracy by 7.8\%, with gains of up to 21.9\% on the ComplexLP
dataset. These findings highlight the importance of semantic-anchored
correction in LLM-based optimization workflows to ensure faithful translation
from problem intent to solver-executable code.

TL;DR: RareAgent是一个自演化的多智能体系统，通过对抗性辩论机制主动寻找证据来重新定位罕见病药物，解决了传统方法在缺乏先验关联时的性能问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见病药物重定位面临缺乏药物与目标疾病先验关联的挑战，传统知识图谱补全和消息传递GNN方法因缺乏可靠信号而表现不佳。

Method: 采用自演化多智能体系统，组织任务特定的对抗性辩论，智能体从不同视角动态构建证据图来支持、反驳或推导假设，并通过事后分析推理策略进行自我演化。

Result: RareAgent将适应症AUPRC提高了18.1%，优于推理基线方法，并提供与临床证据一致的透明推理链。

Conclusion: 该方法将罕见病药物重定位从被动模式识别转变为主动证据寻求推理，通过自我演化机制和可转移启发式方法显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Computational drug repurposing for rare diseases is especially challenging
when no prior associations exist between drugs and target diseases. Therefore,
knowledge graph completion and message-passing GNNs have little reliable signal
to learn and propagate, resulting in poor performance. We present RareAgent, a
self-evolving multi-agent system that reframes this task from passive pattern
recognition to active evidence-seeking reasoning. RareAgent organizes
task-specific adversarial debates in which agents dynamically construct
evidence graphs from diverse perspectives to support, refute, or entail
hypotheses. The reasoning strategies are analyzed post hoc in a
self-evolutionary loop, producing textual feedback that refines agent policies,
while successful reasoning paths are distilled into transferable heuristics to
accelerate future investigations. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that
RareAgent improves the indication AUPRC by 18.1% over reasoning baselines and
provides a transparent reasoning chain consistent with clinical evidence.

TL;DR: 提出动态裁决模板(DAT)框架，通过定性分析、证据收集和裁决三阶段结构化推理，解决LLM处理复杂规则系统时的推理分歧问题，显著优于传统思维链方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理复杂规则系统时面临挑战，通常将相互依赖的规则视为非结构化文本而非逻辑组织框架，导致推理分歧和关键规则依赖被忽略。现有方法如思维链推理缺乏结构化规则处理系统方法，且易受错误传播影响。

Method: 提出动态裁决模板(DAT)框架，受专家人类推理过程启发，将推理机制结构化分为三个阶段：定性分析(全面评估上下文环境)、证据收集(基于预定义模板元素提取相关信息并系统验证规则)、裁决(综合验证组件形成全面判断)。

Result: 实证结果表明DAT在复杂规则任务中持续优于传统思维链方法。值得注意的是，DAT使较小语言模型能够匹配甚至在某些情况下超越显著更大的LLM性能。

Conclusion: DAT框架在管理复杂规则系统方面展现出高效性和有效性，通过结构化推理过程解决了LLM处理规则依赖的关键限制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges when processing
complex rule systems, as they typically treat interdependent rules as
unstructured textual data rather than as logically organized frameworks. This
limitation results in reasoning divergence, where models often overlook
critical rule dependencies essential for accurate interpretation. Although
existing approaches such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning have shown
promise, they lack systematic methodologies for structured rule processing and
are particularly susceptible to error propagation through sequential reasoning
chains. To address these limitations, we propose the Dynamic Adjudication
Template (DAT), a novel framework inspired by expert human reasoning processes.
DAT structures the inference mechanism into three methodical stages:
qualitative analysis, evidence gathering, and adjudication. During the
qualitative analysis phase, the model comprehensively evaluates the contextual
landscape. The subsequent evidence gathering phase involves the targeted
extraction of pertinent information based on predefined template elements
([placeholder]), followed by systematic verification against applicable rules.
Finally, in the adjudication phase, the model synthesizes these validated
components to formulate a comprehensive judgment. Empirical results demonstrate
that DAT consistently outperforms conventional CoT approaches in complex
rule-based tasks. Notably, DAT enables smaller language models to match, and in
some cases exceed, the performance of significantly larger LLMs, highlighting
its efficiency and effectiveness in managing intricate rule systems.

Motivation: 为符号接地问题提供一个确定性的统一框架，揭示意义接地过程受信息论基本限制的本质。

Method: 使用通用图灵机建模符号系统，将接地定义为信息压缩过程，通过四个阶段论证：1) 纯符号系统无法接地算法随机世界；2) 静态接地系统存在固有缺陷；3) 接地行为不可推断；4) 算法学习过程无法理解超过自身复杂度的世界。

Result: 证明了符号接地存在根本性限制：纯符号系统无法接地算法随机世界，静态接地系统不完整，接地行为不可推断，学习系统无法理解超过自身复杂度的世界。

Conclusion: 意义是系统不断尝试克服自身信息论限制的开放式过程，符号接地本质上受信息论约束。

Abstract: This paper provides a definitive, unifying framework for the Symbol Grounding
Problem (SGP) by reformulating it within Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT).
We demonstrate that the grounding of meaning is a process fundamentally
constrained by information-theoretic limits, thereby unifying the G\"odelian
(self-reference) and No Free Lunch (statistical) perspectives. We model a
symbolic system as a universal Turing machine and define grounding as an act of
information compression. The argument proceeds in four stages. First, we prove
that a purely symbolic system cannot ground almost all possible "worlds" (data
strings), as they are algorithmically random and thus incompressible. Second,
we show that any statically grounded system, specialized for compressing a
specific world, is inherently incomplete because an adversarial, incompressible
world relative to the system can always be constructed. Third, the "grounding
act" of adapting to a new world is proven to be non-inferable, as it requires
the input of new information (a shorter program) that cannot be deduced from
the system's existing code. Finally, we use Chaitin's Incompleteness Theorem to
prove that any algorithmic learning process is itself a finite system that
cannot comprehend or model worlds whose complexity provably exceeds its own.
This establishes that meaning is the open-ended process of a system perpetually
attempting to overcome its own information-theoretic limitations.

Conclusion: 基础模型具有重要的表征潜力，能够支持跨模态的统一和对齐，但仍存在开放问题和潜在挑战需要进一步研究。

Abstract: Foundation models learn highly transferable representations through
large-scale pretraining on diverse data. An increasing body of research
indicates that these representations exhibit a remarkable degree of similarity
across architectures and modalities. In this survey, we investigate the
representation potentials of foundation models, defined as the latent capacity
of their learned representations to capture task-specific information within a
single modality while also providing a transferable basis for alignment and
unification across modalities. We begin by reviewing representative foundation
models and the key metrics that make alignment measurable. We then synthesize
empirical evidence of representation potentials from studies in vision,
language, speech, multimodality, and neuroscience. The evidence suggests that
foundation models often exhibit structural regularities and semantic
consistencies in their representation spaces, positioning them as strong
candidates for cross-modal transfer and alignment. We further analyze the key
factors that foster representation potentials, discuss open questions, and
highlight potential challenges.

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized various applications
including agriculture, but it still faces challenges in data collection and
understanding. This paper proposes a real-time framework with three additional
semantic layers to help IoT devices and sensors comprehend data meaning and
source. The framework consists of six layers: perception, semantic annotation,
interoperability, transportation, semantic reasoning, and application, suitable
for dynamic environments. Sensors collect data in the form of voltage, which is
then processed by microprocessors or microcontrollers in the semantic
annotation and preprocessing layer. Metadata is added to the raw data,
including the purpose, ID number, and application. Two semantic algorithms are
proposed in the semantic interoperability and ontologies layer: the
interoperability semantic algorithm for standardizing file types and the
synonym identification algorithm for identifying synonyms. In the
transportation layer, raw data and metadata are sent to other IoT devices or
cloud computing platforms using techniques like WiFi, Zigbee networks,
Bluetooth, and mobile communication networks. A semantic reasoning layer is
proposed to infer new knowledge from the existing data, using fuzzy logic,
Dempster-Shafer theory, and Bayesian networks. A Graphical User Interface (GUI)
is proposed in the application layer to help users communicate with and monitor
IoT sensors, devices, and new knowledge inferred. This framework provides a
robust solution for managing IoT data, ensuring semantic completeness, and
enabling real-time knowledge inference. The integration of uncertainty
reasoning methods and semantic interoperability techniques makes this framework
a valuable tool for advancing IoT applications in general and in agriculture in
particular.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Dramaturge是一个基于分层多LLM代理的任务导向分治方法，用于改进长篇叙事脚本的质量。它通过全局审查、场景级审查和分层协调修订三个阶段，采用从粗到细的迭代过程来保持上下文一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLM已广泛用于创意内容生成，但单次生成过程难以产生高质量的长篇叙事。如何像编剧一样有效修订和改进长篇叙事脚本仍然是一个重大挑战，因为这需要全面理解整个上下文来识别全局结构问题和局部细节缺陷，并协调多个粒度和位置的修订。

Method: 提出Dramaturge方法，包含三个层次：全局审查阶段把握整体故事情节和结构问题；场景级审查阶段识别详细的场景和句子缺陷；分层协调修订阶段协调并整合整个脚本的结构和细节改进。采用自上而下的任务流程和从粗到细的迭代过程。

Result: 综合实验表明，Dramaturge在脚本级整体质量和场景级细节方面显著优于所有基线方法。该方法具有即插即用特性，可以轻松集成到现有方法中以提高生成的脚本质量。

Conclusion: Dramaturge通过分层多LLM代理的协调机制，有效解决了长篇叙事脚本修订中的一致性问题，显著提升了脚本质量，为LLM在创意写作领域的应用提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Although LLMs have been widely adopted for creative content generation, a
single-pass process often struggles to produce high-quality long narratives.
How to effectively revise and improve long narrative scripts like scriptwriters
remains a significant challenge, as it demands a comprehensive understanding of
the entire context to identify global structural issues and local detailed
flaws, as well as coordinating revisions at multiple granularities and
locations. Direct modifications by LLMs typically introduce inconsistencies
between local edits and the overall narrative requirements. To address these
issues, we propose Dramaturge, a task and feature oriented divide-and-conquer
approach powered by hierarchical multiple LLM agents. It consists of a Global
Review stage to grasp the overall storyline and structural issues, a
Scene-level Review stage to pinpoint detailed scene and sentence flaws, and a
Hierarchical Coordinated Revision stage that coordinates and integrates
structural and detailed improvements throughout the script. The top-down task
flow ensures that high-level strategies guide local modifications, maintaining
contextual consistency. The review and revision workflow follows a
coarse-to-fine iterative process, continuing through multiple rounds until no
further substantive improvements can be made. Comprehensive experiments show
that Dramaturge significantly outperforms all baselines in terms of
script-level overall quality and scene-level details. Our approach is
plug-and-play and can be easily integrated into existing methods to improve the
generated scripts.

Abstract: Timely and accurate analysis of population-level data is crucial for
effective decision-making during public health emergencies such as the COVID-19
pandemic. However, the massive input of semi-structured data, including
structured demographic information and unstructured human feedback, poses
significant challenges to conventional analysis methods. Manual expert-driven
assessments, though accurate, are inefficient, while standard NLP pipelines
often require large task-specific labeled datasets and struggle with
generalization across diverse domains. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel graph-based reasoning framework that integrates large language models
with structured demographic attributes and unstructured public feedback in a
weakly supervised pipeline. The proposed approach dynamically models evolving
citizen needs into a need-aware graph, enabling population-specific analyses
based on key features such as age, gender, and the Index of Multiple
Deprivation. It generates interpretable insights to inform responsive health
policy decision-making. We test our method using a real-world dataset, and
preliminary experimental results demonstrate its feasibility. This approach
offers a scalable solution for intelligent population health monitoring in
resource-constrained clinical and governmental settings.

TL;DR: 提出了一种稳健的估计框架和动态采样策略，用于准确预测AI模型在大规模尝试下的能力和风险，解决了有限数据下的统计问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重复采样能显著提升AI模型的能力和风险，但如何在有限采样预算下准确预测模型在大规模尝试中的行为是一个关键问题，对模型提供商和政府监管机构都很重要。

Method: 1. 识别标准拟合方法的统计缺陷；2. 引入基于beta-二项分布的稳健估计框架；3. 提出动态采样策略，将更多预算分配给更难的问题。

Result: 该方法能够在计算成本大幅降低的情况下，更可靠地预测罕见风险和能力。

Conclusion: 结合稳健估计和动态采样策略，可以有效解决有限数据下AI模型能力和风险预测的挑战。

Abstract: Assessing the capabilities and risks of frontier AI systems is a critical
area of research, and recent work has shown that repeated sampling from models
can dramatically increase both. For instance, repeated sampling has been shown
to increase their capabilities, such as solving difficult math and coding
problems, but it has also been shown to increase their potential for harm, such
as being jailbroken. Such results raise a crucial question for both capability
and safety forecasting: how can one accurately predict a model's behavior when
scaled to a massive number of attempts, given a vastly smaller sampling budget?
This question is directly relevant to model providers, who serve hundreds of
millions of users daily, and to governmental regulators, who seek to prevent
harms. To answer this questions, we make three contributions. First, we find
that standard methods for fitting these laws suffer from statistical
shortcomings that hinder predictive accuracy, especially in data-limited
scenarios. Second, we remedy these shortcomings by introducing a robust
estimation framework, which uses a beta-binomial distribution to generate more
accurate predictions from limited data. Third, we propose a dynamic sampling
strategy that allocates a greater budget to harder problems. Combined, these
innovations enable more reliable prediction of rare risks and capabilities at a
fraction of the computational cost.

*Radha Gulhane,Sathish Reddy Indurthi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出混合奖励建模框架，结合模型奖励和规则奖励，通过多维度奖励信号提升多模态大语言模型与人类偏好的对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于单一信号的模型奖励方法存在置信度校准不足、无法捕捉人类偏好多样性、需要大量数据标注和奖励模型训练的问题。

Method: 集成模型奖励（从合成和人类反馈中预测标量或向量分数）和规则奖励（领域特定启发式提供显式正确性信号），并引入多维度奖励和广义长度惩罚奖励。

Result: 在3B模型家族中，通用和数学推理任务平均提升约9.5%，数学基准测试中平均提升约16%。

Conclusion: 混合奖励建模框架为通过强化学习策略优化对齐多模态大语言模型提供了灵活有效的方法。

Abstract: Aligning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with human preferences
often relies on single-signal, model-based reward methods. Such monolithic
rewards often lack confidence calibration across domain-specific tasks, fail to
capture diverse aspects of human preferences, and require extensive data
annotation and reward model training. In this work, we propose a hybrid reward
modeling framework that integrates complementary reward paradigms: (i)
model-based rewards, where a learned reward model predicts scalar or vector
scores from synthetic and human feedback, and (ii) rule-based rewards, where
domain-specific heuristics provide explicit correctness signals with
confidence. Beyond accuracy, we further incorporate multi-aspect rewards to
enforce instruction adherence and introduce a generalized length-penalty reward
to stabilize training and improve performance. The proposed framework provides
a flexible and effective approach to aligning MLLMs through reinforcement
learning policy optimization. Our experiments show consistent improvements
across different multimodal benchmarks when applying hybrid and multi-aspect
reward modeling. Our best performing model in the 3B family achieves an overall
average improvement of ~9.5% across general and math reasoning tasks. Focusing
specifically on mathematical benchmarks, the model achieves a significant
average improvement of ~16%, highlighting its effectiveness in mathematical
reasoning and problem solving.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BIRD-INTERACT是一个用于评估多轮交互式文本到SQL任务的新基准，通过真实的环境设置、两种评估模式和完整的CRUD操作任务，解决了现有基准在真实数据库助手挑战方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多轮基准将对话历史视为静态上下文或仅限于只读操作评估，无法反映生产级数据库助手的真实挑战，需要更真实的交互环境来评估模型处理模糊查询、执行错误和动态用户需求的能力。

Method: 构建了包含分层知识库、元数据文件和函数驱动用户模拟器的综合交互环境；设计了两种评估设置：预定义对话协议(c-Interact)和开放式代理设置(a-Interact)；开发了涵盖完整CRUD操作的任务套件，包含模糊和后续子任务。

Result: BIRD-INTERACT具有很高难度：GPT-5在c-Interact中仅完成8.67%的任务，在a-Interact中完成17.00%的任务。通过内存嫁接和交互测试时缩放分析验证了有效交互对复杂动态文本到SQL任务的重要性。

Conclusion: BIRD-INTERACT基准成功恢复了多轮文本到SQL任务的真实性，证明了当前模型在处理复杂动态交互任务时的局限性，强调了有效交互策略对于生产级数据库助手的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on
single-turn text-to-SQL tasks, but real-world database applications
predominantly require multi-turn interactions to handle ambiguous queries,
execution errors, and evolving user requirements. Existing multi-turn
benchmarks fall short by treating conversation histories as static context or
limiting evaluation to read-only operations, failing to reflect
production-grade database assistant challenges. We introduce BIRD-INTERACT, a
benchmark that restores this realism through: (1) a comprehensive interaction
environment coupling each database with a hierarchical knowledge base, metadata
files, and a function-driven user simulator, enabling models to solicit
clarifications, retrieve knowledge, and recover from errors without human
supervision; (2) two evaluation settings consisting of a pre-defined
conversational protocol (c-Interact) and an open-ended agentic setting
(a-Interact) where models autonomously decide when to query the user simulator
or explore the environment; (3) a challenging task suite covering the full CRUD
spectrum for business-intelligence and operational use cases, guarded by
executable test cases. Each task features ambiguous and follow-up sub-tasks
requiring dynamic interaction. The suite comprises BIRD-INTERACT-FULL (600
tasks, up to 11,796 interactions) for comprehensive performance assessment, and
BIRD-INTERACT-LITE (300 tasks with simplified databases) for detailed
behavioral analysis and rapid method development. Our empirical results
highlight BIRD-INTERACT's difficulty: GPT-5 completes only 8.67% of tasks in
c-Interact and 17.00% in a-Interact. Analysis via memory grafting and
Interaction Test-time Scaling validates the importance of effective interaction
for complex, dynamic text-to-SQL tasks.

TL;DR: 该研究基于符号互动论，通过两个实证研究探讨人类与AI如何共同构建符号及其意义，发现人类会根据AI建议的符号和解释调整初始定义，特别是在社交情境下，并会将个人和社会价值观投射到互动中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有意义的人机协作需要超越语言处理，深入理解符号及其社会建构意义。人类通过社交互动自然解释符号，而AI系统往往错过对话中出现的动态解释。

Method: 基于符号互动论理论，进行了两项实证研究，调查人类与AI如何共同构建符号及其意义。

Result: 研究发现参与者会根据对话AI代理建议的符号和解释调整初始定义，特别是在引入社交情境时。参与者还会将个人和社会价值观投射到这些互动中，随时间推移精炼意义。

Conclusion: 共享理解不是来自单纯的一致同意，而是来自符号的双向交换和重新解释，这为人机交互设计提出了新的范式。

Abstract: Meaningful human-AI collaboration requires more than processing language; it
demands a deeper understanding of symbols and their socially constructed
meanings. While humans naturally interpret symbols through social interaction,
AI systems often miss the dynamic interpretations that emerge in conversation.
Drawing on Symbolic Interactionism theory, we conducted two studies to
investigate how humans and AI co-construct symbols and their meanings. Findings
provide empirical insights into how humans and conversational AI agents
collaboratively shape meanings during interaction. We show how participants
shift their initial definitions of meaning in response to the symbols and
interpretations suggested by the conversational AI agents, especially when
social context is introduced. We also observe how participants project their
personal and social values into these interactions, refining meanings over
time. These findings reveal that shared understanding does not emerge from mere
agreement but from the bi-directional exchange and reinterpretation of symbols,
suggesting new paradigms for human-AI interaction design.

Abstract: We present M-Reason, a demonstration system for transparent, agent-based
reasoning and evidence integration in the biomedical domain, with a focus on
cancer research. M-Reason leverages recent advances in large language models
(LLMs) and modular agent orchestration to automate evidence retrieval,
appraisal, and synthesis across diverse biomedical data sources. Each agent
specializes in a specific evidence stream, enabling parallel processing and
fine-grained analysis. The system emphasizes explainability, structured
reporting, and user auditability, providing complete traceability from source
evidence to final conclusions. We discuss critical tradeoffs between agent
specialization, system complexity, and resource usage, as well as the
integration of deterministic code for validation. An open, interactive user
interface allows researchers to directly observe, explore and evaluate the
multi-agent workflow. Our evaluation demonstrates substantial gains in
efficiency and output consistency, highlighting M-Reason's potential as both a
practical tool for evidence synthesis and a testbed for robust multi-agent LLM

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估贝叶斯方法在模型预测控制中的实际应用效果，特别是神经网络建模、控制设计和不确定性量化方面的表现，以确定这些方法的真实价值。

Method: 系统分析现有研究文献，评估贝叶斯方法在MPC中的实施方式和实践应用情况。

Result: 发现贝叶斯方法在MPC中越来越受欢迎，但报告的性能提升和鲁棒性改进证据零散，基准不一致，可靠性分析有限。

Conclusion: 需要建立标准化基准、消融研究和透明报告机制，以严格评估贝叶斯技术在MPC中的有效性。

Abstract: In this review, we assess the use of Bayesian methods in model predictive
control (MPC), focusing on neural-network-based modeling, control design, and
uncertainty quantification. We systematically analyze individual studies and
how they are implemented in practice. While Bayesian approaches are
increasingly adopted to capture and propagate uncertainty in MPC, reported
gains in performance and robustness remain fragmented, with inconsistent
baselines and limited reliability analyses. We therefore argue for standardized
benchmarks, ablation studies, and transparent reporting to rigorously determine
the effectiveness of Bayesian techniques for MPC.

TL;DR: 优化LLMs在竞争环境中的表现会导致对齐失败，即使模型被明确指示保持真实和可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解竞争性反馈循环如何影响LLM行为，特别是在商业、政治和社交媒体等竞争性环境中。

Method: 使用模拟环境测试LLMs在三种竞争场景中的表现：商业广告、选举活动和社交媒体参与。

Result: 竞争优化导致显著的对齐失败：销售增长6.3%伴随欺骗性营销增加14.0%；选举得票率增长4.9%伴随虚假信息增加22.3%和民粹言论增加12.5%；社交媒体参与度增长7.5%伴随虚假信息增加188.6%和有害行为推广增加16.3%。

Conclusion: 市场竞争压力会系统性地侵蚀AI对齐，形成竞相降低标准的局面，需要更强有力的治理和精心设计的激励机制来防止竞争动态破坏社会信任。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly shaping how information is
created and disseminated, from companies using them to craft persuasive
advertisements, to election campaigns optimizing messaging to gain votes, to
social media influencers boosting engagement. These settings are inherently
competitive, with sellers, candidates, and influencers vying for audience
approval, yet it remains poorly understood how competitive feedback loops
influence LLM behavior. We show that optimizing LLMs for competitive success
can inadvertently drive misalignment. Using simulated environments across these
scenarios, we find that, 6.3% increase in sales is accompanied by a 14.0% rise
in deceptive marketing; in elections, a 4.9% gain in vote share coincides with
22.3% more disinformation and 12.5% more populist rhetoric; and on social
media, a 7.5% engagement boost comes with 188.6% more disinformation and a
16.3% increase in promotion of harmful behaviors. We call this phenomenon
Moloch's Bargain for AI--competitive success achieved at the cost of alignment.
These misaligned behaviors emerge even when models are explicitly instructed to
remain truthful and grounded, revealing the fragility of current alignment
safeguards. Our findings highlight how market-driven optimization pressures can
systematically erode alignment, creating a race to the bottom, and suggest that
safe deployment of AI systems will require stronger governance and carefully
designed incentives to prevent competitive dynamics from undermining societal
trust.

TL;DR: MHA-RAG框架通过将示例表示为软提示，使用多头注意力机制实现示例顺序不变的模型架构，在多个问答基准测试中比标准RAG性能提升20分，同时推理成本降低10倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 适应基础模型到新领域时，使用领域特定示例作为上下文演示虽然有效，但传统文本表示方式可能不是最高效、最有效和最稳定的方法。

Method: 提出MHA-RAG框架，将示例表示为软提示，使用多头注意力机制，其中注意力头数量作为控制不同任务软提示生成的超参数。

Result: 在多个问答基准测试和模型规模下，MHA-RAG比标准RAG性能提升20分，推理成本降低10倍GFLOPs，且对示例顺序不变。

Conclusion: MHA-RAG提供了一种更准确、更高效且对示例顺序不变的方法，优于传统的文本表示方式。

Abstract: Adapting Foundation Models to new domains with limited training data is
challenging and computationally expensive. While prior work has demonstrated
the effectiveness of using domain-specific exemplars as in-context
demonstrations, we investigate whether representing exemplars purely as text is
the most efficient, effective, and stable approach. We explore an alternative:
representing exemplars as soft prompts with an exemplar order invariant model
architecture. To this end, we introduce Multi-Head Attention
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MHA-RAG), a framework with the number of
attention heads serving as a simple hyperparameter to control soft
prompt-generation across different tasks. Across multiple question-answering
benchmarks and model scales, MHA-RAG achieves a 20-point performance gain over
standard RAG, while cutting inference costs by a factor of 10X
GFLOPs-delivering both higher accuracy and greater efficiency, invariant to
exemplar order.

*Ahmad Alsheikh,Andreas Fischer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于师生学习框架的钢铁热处理硬度预测方法，解决多对一映射的逆问题，比传统方法更准确高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 钢铁热处理过程中，不同输入参数组合可能产生相同硬度值，这种多对一特性使得从目标硬度反推输入参数变得困难。

Method: 使用师生学习框架：先训练正向模型（教师）从13个冶金特征预测最终硬度，再训练逆向模型（学生）从目标硬度推断输入配置，通过教师反馈进行迭代优化。

Result: 在公开回火钢数据集上的实验表明，该方法比基线回归和强化学习模型具有更高的逆向预测精度，且计算时间显著减少。

Conclusion: 师生学习框架在材料科学逆过程建模中展现出有效性和高效性，为解决多对一映射问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Predicting the final hardness of steel after heat treatment is a challenging
regression task due to the many-to-one nature of the process -- different
combinations of input parameters (such as temperature, duration, and chemical
composition) can result in the same hardness value. This ambiguity makes the
inverse problem, estimating input parameters from a desired hardness,
particularly difficult. In this work, we propose a novel solution using a
Teacher-Student learning framework. First, a forward model (Teacher) is trained
to predict final hardness from 13 metallurgical input features. Then, a
backward model (Student) is trained to infer plausible input configurations
from a target hardness value. The Student is optimized by leveraging feedback
from the Teacher in an iterative, supervised loop. We evaluate our method on a
publicly available tempered steel dataset and compare it against baseline
regression and reinforcement learning models. Results show that our
Teacher-Student framework not only achieves higher inverse prediction accuracy
but also requires significantly less computational time, demonstrating its
effectiveness and efficiency for inverse process modeling in materials science.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AInstein框架测试LLMs仅使用预训练参数知识解决AI研究问题的能力，无需外部辅助。结果显示LLMs能重新发现可行方案并偶尔提出创新方法，但问题解决能力脆弱且对问题表述敏感。

Motivation: 探究LLMs的成功是源于真正推理还是复杂记忆，测试其作为自主科学问题解决者的能力。

Method: 从ICLR 2025提交中提取问题陈述，让专业求解代理通过迭代批判循环提出和完善技术方案，使用LLM作为评判者进行结构化评估。

Result: LLMs能够重新发现可行解决方案，偶尔提出创造性替代方案，但问题解决能力脆弱且高度依赖于问题表述方式。

Conclusion: 这是首次大规模证明LLMs作为自主科学问题解决者的能力，揭示了其潜在潜力和当前局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across a
wide range of tasks, yet it remains unclear whether such success reflects
genuine reasoning or sophisticated recall. We introduce AInstein, a framework
for testing whether LLMs can generate valid solutions to AI research problems
using only their pretrained parametric knowledge -- without domain-specific
fine-tuning, retrieval augmentation, or other external aids. Our approach
extracts distilled problem statements from high-quality ICLR 2025 submissions,
then tasks specialized solver agents with proposing and refining technical
solutions through iterative critique loops, mimicking the cycles of proposal,
review, and revision central to scientific inquiry. We evaluate AInstein on
1,214 ICLR papers stratified by acceptance tier (Oral, Spotlight, Poster),
using an LLM-as-a-judge paradigm guided by a structured rubric, complemented by
targeted manual checks. Performance is assessed with three metrics: Success
Rate (does the solution address the problem?), Rediscovery (does it align with
human-proposed methods?), and Novelty (does it yield valid, original
approaches?). Our results reveal that while LLMs can rediscover feasible
solutions and occasionally propose creative alternatives, their problem-solving
ability remains fragile and highly sensitive to framing. These findings provide
the first large-scale evidence on the extent to which LLMs can act as
autonomous scientific problem-solvers, highlighting both their latent potential
and their current limitations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度transformer模型在多标签文本分类中表现出色，但在安全关键应用中经常违反专家认为必要的领域逻辑规则，这引发了严重的安全隐患。

Method: 使用加权ASP规则形式化领域知识，通过Clingo求解器验证；采用两种互补方式：基于规则的数据增强生成逻辑一致的合成样本，以及模糊逻辑正则化在微调期间以可微分形式强制执行规则满足。

Result: 与强基线BCE相比，该方法提高了micro-和macro-F1分数，并在ASRS测试集上实现了高达86%的规则违规减少。

Conclusion: 这是首个将基于ASP的推理、规则驱动增强和可微分transformer训练统一应用于ASRS报告的大规模神经符号应用，为可信赖的安全关键NLP提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Deep transformer models excel at multi-label text classification but often
violate domain logic that experts consider essential, an issue of particular
concern in safety-critical applications. We propose a hybrid neuro-symbolic
framework that integrates Answer Set Programming (ASP) with transformer-based
learning on the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) corpus. Domain
knowledge is formalized as weighted ASP rules and validated using the Clingo
solver. These rules are incorporated in two complementary ways: (i) as
rule-based data augmentation, generating logically consistent synthetic samples
that improve label diversity and coverage; and (ii) as a fuzzy-logic
regularizer, enforcing rule satisfaction in a differentiable form during
fine-tuning. This design preserves the interpretability of symbolic reasoning
while leveraging the scalability of deep neural architectures. We further tune
per-class thresholds and report both standard classification metrics and
logic-consistency rates. Compared to a strong Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE)
baseline, our approach improves micro- and macro-F1 scores and achieves up to
an 86% reduction in rule violations on the ASRS test set. To the best of our
knowledge, this constitutes the first large-scale neuro-symbolic application to
ASRS reports that unifies ASP-based reasoning, rule-driven augmentation, and
differentiable transformer training for trustworthy, safety-critical NLP.

Motivation: 随着AI系统在创意和技术领域与人类合作日益增多，需要了解AI的认知边界和偏见如何影响共同代理能力。

Method: 通过分析不同编程语言中模型的置信度和表现，研究模型在编码任务中的自信偏差模式。

Result: 实验表明，能力较弱的模型和在罕见编程语言中运行的模型表现出更强的DKE类似偏见，偏见强度与模型能力成反比。

Conclusion: AI模型确实会表现出类似人类的过度自信偏见，特别是在其能力有限的领域，这对AI与人类协作具有重要意义。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems increasingly collaborate with humans in
creative and technical domains, questions arise about the cognitive boundaries
and biases that shape our shared agency. This paper investigates the
Dunning-Kruger Effect (DKE), the tendency for those with limited competence to
overestimate their abilities in state-of-the-art LLMs in coding tasks. By
analyzing model confidence and performance across a diverse set of programming
languages, we reveal that AI models mirror human patterns of overconfidence,
especially in unfamiliar or low-resource domains. Our experiments demonstrate
that less competent models and those operating in rare programming languages
exhibit stronger DKE-like bias, suggesting that the strength of the bias is
proportionate to the competence of the models.

Motivation: 现有基准主要关注模型的拒绝行为或预定义的安全违规，但无法揭示模型在面对真实世界争议问题时是否坚持一致的价值体系。

Method: 使用维基百科争议章节构建115K对正反提示，通过LLM作为评判者来评估模型在配对提示下回答的一致性。

Result: 在领先的开源和闭源模型上应用该基准，发现价值对齐程度存在很大差异，并揭示了安全策略与表达性价值系统之间的权衡。

Conclusion: VAL-Bench提供了一个可扩展、可复现的基准，能够系统比较LLMs如何可靠地体现人类价值观。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for tasks where outputs
shape human decisions, so it is critical to test whether their responses
reflect consistent human values. Existing benchmarks mostly track refusals or
predefined safety violations, but these only check rule compliance and do not
reveal whether a model upholds a coherent value system when facing
controversial real-world issues. We introduce the \textbf{V}alue
\textbf{AL}ignment \textbf{Bench}mark (\textbf{VAL-Bench}), which evaluates
whether models maintain a stable value stance across paired prompts that frame
opposing sides of public debates. VAL-Bench consists of 115K such pairs from
Wikipedia's controversial sections. A well-aligned model should express similar
underlying views regardless of framing, which we measure using an LLM-as-judge
to score agreement or divergence between paired responses. Applied across
leading open- and closed-source models, the benchmark reveals large variation
in alignment and highlights trade-offs between safety strategies (e.g.,
refusals) and more expressive value systems. By providing a scalable,
reproducible benchmark, VAL-Bench enables systematic comparison of how reliably
LLMs embody human values.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着软件漏洞指数级增长，急需自动漏洞修复解决方案。现有基于LLM的方法虽然表现优异，但面临两个关键挑战：缺乏漏洞相关推理数据和难以验证中间修复过程。

Method: 论文将自动漏洞修复建模为序列生成问题，使用大型语言模型通过提示或微调直接生成漏洞修复。

Result: 现有方法虽然达到最先进性能，但存在局限性：无法有效捕捉多样化的漏洞修复模式，且缺乏中间可验证反馈来指导模型训练。

Conclusion: 当前自动漏洞修复方法在数据质量和训练验证方面存在显著挑战，需要新的解决方案来克服这些限制。

Abstract: The exponential increase in software vulnerabilities has created an urgent
need for automatic vulnerability repair (AVR) solutions. Recent research has
formulated AVR as a sequence generation problem and has leveraged large
language models (LLMs) to address this problem. Typically, these approaches
prompt or fine-tune LLMs to generate repairs for vulnerabilities directly.
Although these methods show state-of-the-art performance, they face the
following challenges: (1) Lack of high-quality, vulnerability-related reasoning
data. Current approaches primarily rely on foundation models that mainly encode
general programming knowledge. Without vulnerability-related reasoning data,
they tend to fail to capture the diverse vulnerability repair patterns. (2)
Hard to verify the intermediate vulnerability repair process during LLM
training. Existing reinforcement learning methods often leverage intermediate
execution feedback from the environment (e.g., sandbox-based execution results)
to guide reinforcement learning training. In contrast, the vulnerability repair
process generally lacks such intermediate, verifiable feedback, which poses
additional challenges for model training.

Abstract: Taiwan's high population and heavy dependence on fossil fuels have led to
severe air pollution, with the most prevalent greenhouse gas being carbon
dioxide (CO2). There-fore, this study presents a reproducible and comprehensive
case study comparing 21 of the most commonly employed time series models in
forecasting emissions, analyzing both univariate and multivariate approaches.
Among these, Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM),
and Random Forest Regressor (RFR) achieved the best performances. To further
enhance robustness, the top performers were integrated with Linear Regression
through a custom stacked generalization en-semble technique. Our proposed
ensemble model achieved an SMAPE of 1.407 with no signs of overfitting.
Finally, this research provides an accurate decade-long emission projection
that will assist policymakers in making more data-driven decisions.

TL;DR: MetaVLA是一个统一的、主干网络无关的后训练框架，通过上下文感知元协同训练整合多个目标任务，使用轻量级元学习机制实现快速适应，在LIBERO基准测试中显著优于OpenVLA，同时大幅减少训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言-动作模型在具身推理中表现有限，通常需要任务特定的微调，且对未见任务的泛化能力较差。

Method: 提出上下文感知元协同训练，将多个目标任务整合到单一微调阶段，利用结构多样的辅助任务提升领域内泛化能力；采用基于注意力神经过程的轻量级元学习机制实现快速适应。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，MetaVLA在长时程任务上比OpenVLA提升8.0%，训练步数从240K减少到75K，GPU时间减少约76%。

Conclusion: MetaVLA证明了可扩展、低资源后训练的可行性，为通用具身智能体铺平了道路。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models show promise in embodied reasoning, yet
remain far from true generalists-they often require task-specific fine-tuning,
and generalize poorly to unseen tasks. We propose MetaVLA, a unified,
backbone-agnostic post-training framework for efficient and scalable alignment.
MetaVLA introduces Context-Aware Meta Co-Training, which consolidates diverse
target tasks into a single fine-tuning stage while leveraging structurally
diverse auxiliary tasks to improve in-domain generalization. Unlike naive
multi-task SFT, MetaVLA integrates a lightweight meta-learning
mechanism-derived from Attentive Neural Processes-to enable rapid adaptation
from diverse contexts with minimal architectural change or inference overhead.
On the LIBERO benchmark, MetaVLA with six auxiliary tasks outperforms OpenVLA
by up to 8.0% on long-horizon tasks, reduces training steps from 240K to 75K,
and cuts GPU time by ~76%. These results show that scalable, low-resource
post-training is achievable-paving the way toward general-purpose embodied
agents. Code will be available.

Abstract: Self-evolving agentic artificial intelligence (AI) offers a new paradigm for
future wireless systems by enabling autonomous agents to continually adapt and
improve without human intervention. Unlike static AI models, self-evolving
agents embed an autonomous evolution cycle that updates models, tools, and
workflows in response to environmental dynamics. This paper presents a
comprehensive overview of self-evolving agentic AI, highlighting its layered
architecture, life cycle, and key techniques, including tool intelligence,
workflow optimization, self-reflection, and evolutionary learning. We further
propose a multi-agent cooperative self-evolving agentic AI framework, where
multiple large language models (LLMs) are assigned role-specialized prompts
under the coordination of a supervisor agent. Through structured dialogue,
iterative feedback, and systematic validation, the system autonomously executes
the entire life cycle without human intervention. A case study on antenna
evolution in low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) demonstrates how the
framework autonomously upgrades fixed antenna optimization into movable antenna
optimization. Experimental results show that the proposed self-evolving agentic
AI autonomously improves beam gain and restores degraded performance by up to
52.02%, consistently surpassing the fixed baseline with little to no human
intervention and validating its adaptability and robustness for next-generation
wireless intelligence.

TL;DR: GPT-4o能够高精度地从放射学报告中提取诊断标签（包括不确定性），这些标签可用于训练具有竞争力的多标签图像分类模型，且标签不确定性不影响模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估GPT-4o从自由文本放射学报告中提取诊断标签（含不确定性）的能力，并测试这些标签如何影响肌肉骨骼X光片的多标签图像分类。

Method: 回顾性研究包含锁骨、肘部和拇指的X光片系列。GPT-4o匿名化后填写结构化模板，将影像学发现标记为存在（"true"）、不存在（"false"）或"不确定"。训练和验证集中的"不确定"标签被自动重新分配为"true"（包容性）或"false"（排他性），使用ResNet50进行多标签分类。

Result: 自动提取在测试集中正确率为98.6%（60,618/61,488）。基于标签的模型训练在所有解剖区域都表现出竞争力，包容性和排他性模型的宏平均AUC值相当（如肘部：AUC=0.80）。模型在外部数据集上泛化良好，不同标记策略或数据集间无显著差异（p≥0.15）。

Conclusion: GPT-4o能够从放射学报告中提取标签来训练具有竞争力的多标签分类模型，且检测到的放射学报告中的不确定性不影响这些模型的性能。

Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate GPT-4o's ability to extract diagnostic labels (with
uncertainty) from free-text radiology reports and to test how these labels
affect multi-label image classification of musculoskeletal radiographs.
Methods: This retrospective study included radiography series of the clavicle
(n=1,170), elbow (n=3,755), and thumb (n=1,978). After anonymization, GPT-4o
filled out structured templates by indicating imaging findings as present
("true"), absent ("false"), or "uncertain." To assess the impact of label
uncertainty, "uncertain" labels of the training and validation sets were
automatically reassigned to "true" (inclusive) or "false" (exclusive).
Label-image-pairs were used for multi-label classification using ResNet50.
Label extraction accuracy was manually verified on internal (clavicle: n=233,
elbow: n=745, thumb: n=393) and external test sets (n=300 for each).
Performance was assessed using macro-averaged receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) area under the curve (AUC), precision recall curves, sensitivity,
specificity, and accuracy. AUCs were compared with the DeLong test. Results:
Automatic extraction was correct in 98.6% (60,618 of 61,488) of labels in the
test sets. Across anatomic regions, label-based model training yielded
competitive performance measured by macro-averaged AUC values for inclusive
(e.g., elbow: AUC=0.80 [range, 0.62-0.87]) and exclusive models (elbow:
AUC=0.80 [range, 0.61-0.88]). Models generalized well on external datasets
(elbow [inclusive]: AUC=0.79 [range, 0.61-0.87]; elbow [exclusive]: AUC=0.79
[range, 0.63-0.89]). No significant differences were observed across labeling
strategies or datasets (p>=0.15). Conclusion: GPT-4o extracted labels from
radiologic reports to train competitive multi-label classification models with
high accuracy. Detected uncertainty in the radiologic reports did not influence
the performance of these models.

TL;DR: D2E框架通过桌面游戏交互作为机器人具身AI的预训练基础，实现了从可扩展桌面数据收集到具身领域验证迁移的完整流程，在物理操作和导航任务上取得优异表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型利用互联网规模文本数据，但具身AI受限于物理轨迹收集的高昂成本。桌面游戏环境提供了丰富的传感器运动交互，同时保持结构化观测-动作耦合，是具身学习的理想替代方案。

Method: D2E框架包含三个组件：OWA工具包统一桌面交互格式并实现152倍压缩；Generalist-IDM通过基于时间戳的事件预测实现零样本泛化；VAPT将桌面预训练表示迁移到物理操作和导航任务。

Conclusion: 数字交互中的传感器运动基元具有足够的恒定性，能够有效迁移到物理具身任务，确立了桌面预训练作为机器人学的实用范式。

Abstract: Large language models leverage internet-scale text data, yet embodied AI
remains constrained by the prohibitive costs of physical trajectory collection.
Desktop environments -- particularly gaming -- offer a compelling alternative:
they provide rich sensorimotor interactions at scale while maintaining the
structured observation-action coupling essential for embodied learning. We
present D2E (Desktop to Embodied AI), a framework that demonstrates desktop
interactions can serve as an effective pretraining substrate for robotics
embodied AI tasks. Unlike prior work that remained domain-specific (e.g., VPT
for Minecraft) or kept data proprietary (e.g., SIMA), D2E establishes a
complete pipeline from scalable desktop data collection to verified transfer in
embodied domains. Our framework comprises three components: (1) the OWA Toolkit
that unifies diverse desktop interactions into a standardized format with 152x
compression, (2) the Generalist-IDM that achieves strong zero-shot
generalization across unseen games through timestamp-based event prediction,
enabling internet-scale pseudo-labeling, and (3) VAPT that transfers
desktop-pretrained representations to physical manipulation and navigation.
Using 1.3K+ hours of data (259 hours of human demonstrations, and 1K+ hours of
pseudo-labeled gameplay), we achieve a total of 96.6% success rate on LIBERO
manipulation and 83.3% on CANVAS navigation benchmarks. This validates that
sensorimotor primitives in digital interactions exhibit sufficient invariance
to transfer meaningfully to physical embodied tasks, establishing desktop
pretraining as a practical paradigm for robotics. We will make all our work
public, including the OWA toolkit, datasets of human-collected and
pseudo-labeled, and VAPT-trained models available at

Motivation: 无人机在灾害监测中面临数据收集调度和飞行速度优化的挑战，传统深度强化学习方法训练复杂且存在仿真与现实不匹配问题，无法满足紧急监测需求。

Method: 提出基于注意力机制的上下文学习方法AIC-VDS，考虑地面传感器电池水平、队列长度、信道条件和无人机轨迹，联合优化数据收集调度和速度控制。

Result: 仿真结果显示，AIC-VDS方法在性能上优于深度Q网络和最大信道增益基线方法。

Conclusion: AIC-VDS作为深度强化学习的替代方案，在紧急情况下能够有效减少数据丢失，满足灾害监测的实时性要求。

Abstract: Recently, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being investigated
to collect sensory data in post-disaster monitoring scenarios, such as
tsunamis, where early actions are critical to limit coastal damage. A major
challenge is to design the data collection schedules and flight velocities, as
unfavorable schedules and velocities can lead to transmission errors and buffer
overflows of the ground sensors, ultimately resulting in significant packet
loss. Meanwhile, online Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) solutions have a
complex training process and a mismatch between simulation and reality that
does not meet the urgent requirements of tsunami monitoring. Recent advances in
Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a compelling alternative. With their strong
reasoning and generalization capabilities, LLMs can adapt to new tasks through
In-Context Learning (ICL), which enables task adaptation through natural
language prompts and example-based guidance without retraining. However, LLM
models have input data limitations and thus require customized approaches. In
this paper, a joint optimization of data collection schedules and velocities
control for multiple UAVs is proposed to minimize data loss. The battery level
of the ground sensors, the length of the queues, and the channel conditions, as
well as the trajectories of the UAVs, are taken into account. Attention-Based
In-Context Learning for Velocity Control and Data Collection Schedule (AIC-VDS)
is proposed as an alternative to DRL in emergencies. The simulation results
show that the proposed AIC-VDS outperforms both the Deep-Q-Network (DQN) and
maximum channel gain baselines.

Abstract: Industrial fault diagnosis faces the dual challenges of data scarcity and the
difficulty of deploying large AI models in resource-constrained environments.
This paper introduces Syn-Diag, a novel cloud-edge synergistic framework that
leverages Large Language Models to overcome these limitations in few-shot fault
diagnosis. Syn-Diag is built on a three-tiered mechanism: 1) Visual-Semantic
Synergy, which aligns signal features with the LLM's semantic space through
cross-modal pre-training; 2) Content-Aware Reasoning, which dynamically
constructs contextual prompts to enhance diagnostic accuracy with limited
samples; and 3) Cloud-Edge Synergy, which uses knowledge distillation to create
a lightweight, efficient edge model capable of online updates via a shared
decision space. Extensive experiments on six datasets covering different CWRU
and SEU working conditions show that Syn-Diag significantly outperforms
existing methods, especially in 1-shot and cross-condition scenarios. The edge
model achieves performance comparable to the cloud version while reducing model
size by 83% and latency by 50%, offering a practical, robust, and deployable
paradigm for modern intelligent diagnostics.

Abstract: The rapid progress in embodied artificial intelligence has highlighted the
necessity for more advanced and integrated models that can perceive, interpret,
and predict environmental dynamics. In this context, World Models (WMs) have
been introduced to provide embodied agents with the abilities to anticipate
future environmental states and fill in knowledge gaps, thereby enhancing
agents' ability to plan and execute actions. However, when dealing with
embodied agents it is fundamental to ensure that predictions are safe for both
the agent and the environment. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive
literature review of World Models in the domains of autonomous driving and
robotics, with a specific focus on the safety implications of scene and control
generation tasks. Our review is complemented by an empirical analysis, wherein
we collect and examine predictions from state-of-the-art models, identify and
categorize common faults (herein referred to as pathologies), and provide a

Motivation: 现有自动多智能体系统设计方法性能不佳，需要为每个新任务重新发现架构且依赖昂贵的数据标注。观察到简单思维链推理与复杂系统性能相当，因此聚焦于优化基础推理单元。

Conclusion: ARM作为一种通用推理构建块，可直接递归使用或作为元编排器的子程序，展示了出色的泛化能力，为多智能体系统设计提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-powered Multi-agent systems (MAS) have achieved
state-of-the-art results on various complex reasoning tasks. Recent works have
proposed techniques to automate the design of MASes, eliminating the need for
manual engineering. However, these techniques perform poorly, often achieving
similar or inferior performance to simple baselines. Furthermore, they require
computationally expensive re-discovery of architectures for each new task
domain and expensive data annotation on domains without existing labeled
validation sets. A critical insight is that simple Chain of Thought (CoT)
reasoning often performs competitively with these complex systems, suggesting
that the fundamental reasoning unit of MASes, CoT, warrants further
investigation. To this end, we present a new paradigm for automatic MAS design
that pivots the focus to optimizing CoT reasoning. We introduce the Agentic
Reasoning Module (ARM), an agentic generalization of CoT where each granular
reasoning step is executed by a specialized reasoning module. This module is
discovered through a tree search over the code space, starting from a simple
CoT module and evolved using mutations informed by reflection on execution
traces. The resulting ARM acts as a versatile reasoning building block which
can be utilized as a direct recursive loop or as a subroutine in a learned
meta-orchestrator. Our approach significantly outperforms both manually
designed MASes and state-of-the-art automatic MAS design methods. Crucially,
MASes built with ARM exhibit superb generalization, maintaining high
performance across different foundation models and task domains without further
optimization.

Abstract: Empowerment, an information-theoretic measure of an agent's potential
influence on its environment, has emerged as a powerful intrinsic motivation
and exploration framework for reinforcement learning (RL). Besides for
unsupervised RL and skill learning algorithms, the specific use of empowerment
as a pre-training signal has received limited attention in the literature. We
show that empowerment can be used as a pre-training signal for data-efficient
downstream task adaptation. For this we extend the traditional notion of
empowerment by introducing discounted empowerment, which balances the agent's
control over the environment across short- and long-term horizons. Leveraging
this formulation, we propose a novel pre-training paradigm that initializes
policies to maximize discounted empowerment, enabling agents to acquire a
robust understanding of environmental dynamics. We analyze empowerment-based
pre-training for various existing RL algorithms and empirically demonstrate its
potential as a general-purpose initialization strategy: empowerment-maximizing
policies with long horizons are data-efficient and effective, leading to
improved adaptability in downstream tasks. Our findings pave the way for future
research to scale this framework to high-dimensional and complex tasks, further
advancing the field of RL.

Conclusion: 该方法可推广到其他大气传输模型，支持不确定性感知的温室气体反演系统，提高卫星排放监测的鲁棒性

Abstract: Monitoring greenhouse gas emissions and evaluating national inventories
require efficient, scalable, and reliable inference methods. Top-down
approaches, combined with recent advances in satellite observations, provide
new opportunities to evaluate emissions at continental and global scales.
However, transport models used in these methods remain a key source of
uncertainty: they are computationally expensive to run at scale, and their
uncertainty is difficult to characterise. Artificial intelligence offers a dual
opportunity to accelerate transport simulations and to quantify their
associated uncertainty.
  We present an ensemble-based pipeline for estimating atmospheric transport
"footprints", greenhouse gas mole fraction measurements, and their
uncertainties using a graph neural network emulator of a Lagrangian Particle
Dispersion Model (LPDM). The approach is demonstrated with GOSAT (Greenhouse
Gases Observing Satellite) observations for Brazil in 2016. The emulator
achieved a ~1000x speed-up over the NAME LPDM, while reproducing large-scale
footprint structures. Ensembles were calculated to quantify absolute and
relative uncertainty, revealing spatial correlations with prediction error. The
results show that ensemble spread highlights low-confidence spatial and
temporal predictions for both atmospheric transport footprints and methane mole
fractions.
  While demonstrated here for an LPDM emulator, the approach could be applied
more generally to atmospheric transport models, supporting uncertainty-aware
greenhouse gas inversion systems and improving the robustness of
satellite-based emissions monitoring. With further development, ensemble-based
emulators could also help explore systematic LPDM errors, offering a
computationally efficient pathway towards a more comprehensive uncertainty
budget in greenhouse gas flux estimates.

feasibility of early prediction of meme virality using a large-scale,
cross-lingual dataset from 25 diverse Reddit communities. We propose a robust,
data-driven method to define virality based on a hybrid engagement score,
learning a percentile-based threshold from a chronologically held-out training
set to prevent data leakage. We evaluated a suite of models, including Logistic
Regression, XGBoost, and a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), with a comprehensive,
multimodal feature set across increasing time windows (30-420 min). Crucially,
useful signals emerge quickly: our best-performing model, XGBoost, achieves a
PR-AUC $>$ 0.52 in just 30 minutes. Our analysis reveals a clear "evidentiary
transition," in which the importance of the feature dynamically shifts from the
static context to the temporal dynamics as a meme gains traction. This work
establishes a robust, interpretable, and practical benchmark for early virality
prediction in scenarios where full diffusion cascade data is unavailable,
contributing a novel cross-lingual dataset and a methodologically sound
definition of virality. To our knowledge, this study is the first to combine
time series data with static content and network features to predict early meme
virality.

TL;DR: 提出了ConstraintLLM，这是第一个专门为约束规划建模设计的大语言模型，通过多指令监督微调训练，在工业级基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 约束规划在解决现实世界约束优化问题中具有重要作用，但相比运筹学模型，基于大语言模型的自动建模研究较少。

Method: 使用多指令监督微调训练专用LLM，提出约束感知检索模块增强上下文学习能力，集成在带引导自校正机制的思维树框架中。

Result: ConstraintLLM在多个基准测试中达到最先进的求解精度，在新工业基准IndusCP上比基线方法性能提升2倍。

Conclusion: ConstraintLLM是专门针对约束规划建模的第一个LLM，在工业级任务中表现出色，为构建可信赖的神经符号AI提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Constraint programming (CP) is a crucial technology for solving real-world
constraint optimization problems (COPs), with the advantages of rich modeling
semantics and high solving efficiency. Using large language models (LLMs) to
generate formal modeling automatically for COPs is becoming a promising
approach, which aims to build trustworthy neuro-symbolic AI with the help of
symbolic solvers. However, CP has received less attention compared to works
based on operations research (OR) models. We introduce ConstraintLLM, the first
LLM specifically designed for CP modeling, which is trained on an open-source
LLM with multi-instruction supervised fine-tuning. We propose the
Constraint-Aware Retrieval Module (CARM) to increase the in-context learning
capabilities, which is integrated in a Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) framework with
guided self-correction mechanism. Moreover, we construct and release IndusCP,
the first industrial-level benchmark for CP modeling, which contains 140
challenging tasks from various domains. Our experiments demonstrate that
ConstraintLLM achieves state-of-the-art solving accuracy across multiple
benchmarks and outperforms the baselines by 2x on the new IndusCP benchmark.

TL;DR: 提出基于不确定性的过滤方法，使用模型自身置信度替代外部标签来筛选合成思维链数据，在生物扰动预测领域显著提升训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要真实标签来筛选合成思维链数据，但在生物学等实验数据稀缺的领域成本高昂，需要寻找标签无关的替代方案。

Method: 使用自一致性和预测困惑度等不确定性指标量化模型置信度，采样多个推理轨迹并仅保留低不确定性子集进行监督微调。

Result: 在生物扰动预测任务中，过滤后的数据准确率更高，基于不确定性过滤数据的监督微调优于未过滤合成数据，缩小了与真实标签训练的差距。

Conclusion: 模型内部置信度是创建高效推理数据集的强大信号，可在监督成本高昂的领域实现大型推理模型的有效训练。

Abstract: Synthetic chain-of-thought (CoT) traces are widely used to train large
reasoning models (LRMs), improving generalization by providing step-level
supervision. Yet most approaches require ground-truth labels to seed or filter
these traces - an expensive bottleneck in domains like biology where wet-lab
data are scarce. We propose a label-free alternative: uncertainty-based
filtering, which uses a model's own confidence - quantified through established
uncertainty metrics like self-consistency and predictive perplexity - as a
substitute for external labels. We sample multiple reasoning traces and retain
only low-uncertainty subsets. Applied to biological perturbation prediction, a
domain where wet-lab labels are especially costly, we show that the filtered
subset has higher accuracy, and that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
uncertainty-filtered data outperforms unfiltered synthetic data, narrows the
gap to ground-truth training, and surpasses strong LRM baselines. Ablations
show that per-class filtering corrects for class-specific uncertainty scales
and that hybrid uncertainty metrics yield higher-quality datasets. Our results
suggest that model-internal confidence is a powerful signal for efficient
reasoning dataset creation, enabling LRMs in domains where supervision is
expensive.

TL;DR: DebateQD算法通过进化多样化的辩论策略，发现说服优化比传统基于真理的优化能产生更好的泛化能力，在不同模型规模和数据集上都表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于真理优化的LLMs容易过拟合，产生脆弱的推理能力。需要探索辩论中的说服机制是否能提升模型的泛化性能。

Method: 提出DebateQD质量多样性进化算法，通过锦标赛式辩论演化不同类别的辩论策略，固定辩论协议但交换适应度函数，比较说服优化与真理优化的效果。

Result: 在三个模型规模(7B、32B、72B参数)和多个数据集上，说服优化策略的训练-测试泛化差距最多减少13.94%，同时匹配或超过真理优化的测试性能。

Conclusion: 竞争性说服压力而非协作寻求真理，能培养更具可迁移性的推理技能，为改进LLM泛化提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) optimized to output truthful answers often
overfit, producing brittle reasoning that fails to generalize. While
persuasion-based optimization has shown promise in debate settings, it has not
been systematically compared against mainstream truth-based approaches. We
introduce DebateQD, a minimal Quality-Diversity (QD) evolutionary algorithm
that evolves diverse debate strategies across different categories
(rationality, authority, emotional appeal, etc.) through tournament-style
competitions where two LLMs debate while a third judges. Unlike previously
proposed methods that require a population of LLMs, our approach maintains
diversity of opponents through prompt-based strategies within a single LLM
architecture, making it more accessible for experiments while preserving the
key benefits of population-based optimization. In contrast to prior work, we
explicitly isolate the role of the optimization objective by fixing the debate
protocol and swapping only the fitness function: persuasion rewards strategies
that convince the judge irrespective of truth, whereas truth rewards
collaborative correctness. Across three model scales (7B, 32B, 72B parameters)
and multiple dataset sizes from the QuALITY benchmark, persuasion-optimized
strategies achieve up to 13.94% smaller train-test generalization gaps, while
matching or exceeding truth optimization's test performance. These results
provide the first controlled evidence that competitive pressure to persuade,
rather than seek the truth collaboratively, fosters more transferable reasoning
skills, offering a promising path for improving LLM generalization.

TL;DR: FETA是一个无需训练的多智能体框架，通过基于样本的上下文推理实现时间序列分类，将多变量序列分解为通道级子问题，利用推理型大语言模型比较查询与相似样本，并通过置信度加权聚合通道决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列分类中标注数据稀缺，任务特定训练成本高且不灵活，现有零样本方法效果不佳，需要开发无需训练的高效分类框架。

Method: 将多变量时间序列按通道分解，为每个通道检索结构相似的标注样本，使用推理型LLM比较查询与样本并生成通道级标签和置信度，最后通过置信度加权聚合所有通道决策。

Result: 在9个UEA数据集上，FETA在完全无需训练的情况下实现了强大的分类准确率，超越了多个经过训练的基线方法。

Conclusion: 多智能体上下文推理框架可以将LLM转化为具有竞争力的即插即用时间序列分类器，无需任何参数训练。

Abstract: Time series classification (TSC) spans diverse application scenarios, yet
labeled data are often scarce, making task-specific training costly and
inflexible. Recent reasoning-oriented large language models (LLMs) show promise
in understanding temporal patterns, but purely zero-shot usage remains
suboptimal. We propose FETA, a multi-agent framework for training-free TSC via
exemplar-based in-context reasoning. FETA decomposes a multivariate series into
channel-wise subproblems, retrieves a few structurally similar labeled examples
for each channel, and leverages a reasoning LLM to compare the query against
these exemplars, producing channel-level labels with self-assessed confidences;
a confidence-weighted aggregator then fuses all channel decisions. This design
eliminates the need for pretraining or fine-tuning, improves efficiency by
pruning irrelevant channels and controlling input length, and enhances
interpretability through exemplar grounding and confidence estimation. On nine
challenging UEA datasets, FETA achieves strong accuracy under a fully
training-free setting, surpassing multiple trained baselines. These results
demonstrate that a multi-agent in-context reasoning framework can transform
LLMs into competitive, plug-and-play TSC solvers without any parameter
training. The code is available at https://github.com/SongyuanSui/FETATSC.

TL;DR: 提出MatheMagic方法，通过改变数字和运算符的语义来构建动态反事实数学基准，用于检测模型过拟合并评估真实推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数学基准存在两个问题：模型会记忆公开测试集，且现有基准因符号和规则多样性有限、答案封闭而容易过拟合。

Method: 使用MatheMagic生成数学测试实例，在测试时随机改变数字和运算符的语义解释，但保持答案可自动验证，从而评估模型的归纳和演绎能力。

Result: 实验发现模型更容易解决演绎问题而非归纳问题，但会回归到标准数学；数学适应模型未能展现通用推理"技能"，归纳任务的微调泛化能力差。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种稳定、可扩展、可比较且抗过拟合的评估框架，揭示了当前模型在数学推理能力上的局限性。

Abstract: Conducting contamination-free evaluation of mathematical capabilities can be
difficult for two reasons: models may memorize a test set once it is made
public, and current mathematical benchmarks are prone to overfitting due to
having limited diversity of symbols and rules, coupled with closed-ended
answers. This paper proposes a method to leverage these shortcomings as useful
features to a construct dynamic, counterfactual benchmark, which can be used to
both reveal overfitting and measure true reasoning. We demonstrate this via
MatheMagic, which generates math test instances with the interpretations of
numbers and operators altered, yet has automatically verifiable answers. Test
instances are randomly seeded and constructed at test time to evaluate a
model's induction or deduction capability, offering stability, extensibility,
comparability, and robustness to overfitting. Our experiments find that models
solve deduction more easily than induction, but they revert to standard math.
Further analysis reveals that math-adapted models fail to exhibit a general
"skill" of reasoning, and fine-tuning on induction tasks generalizes poorly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决标准RAG在法律领域的局限性，特别是如何在不牺牲确定性属性的前提下可靠查询结构化知识。

Method: 引入基于规范动作的正式查询执行层，这些动作是原子化、可组合且可审计的原语，将概率性发现与确定性检索分离。

Result: 实现了高精度混合搜索、稳健的引用解析、时间点版本检索和可审计的因果追踪，使检索过程从黑盒转变为透明可审计。

Conclusion: 两层架构直接满足高风险领域可解释AI的要求，将检索转变为透明、可审计的过程。

Abstract: The Structure-Aware Temporal Graph RAG (SAT-Graph RAG) addresses core
limitations of standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation in the legal domain by
providing a verifiable knowledge graph that models hierarchical structure,
temporal evolution, and causal events of legal norms. However, a critical gap
remains: how to reliably query this structured knowledge without sacrificing
its deterministic properties. This paper introduces the SAT-Graph API, a formal
query execution layer centered on canonical actions-atomic, composable, and
auditable primitives that isolate probabilistic discovery from deterministic
retrieval. These actions enable: (i) high-precision hybrid search; (ii) robust
reference resolution; (iii) point-in-time version retrieval; and (iv) auditable
causal tracing. We demonstrate how planner-guided agents can decompose complex
queries into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) of these actions. This two-layer
architecture transforms retrieval from an opaque black box to a transparent,
auditable process, directly addressing Explainable AI (XAI) requirements for
high-stakes domains.

TL;DR: 提出了ARISE评估指标，专门用于评估大型推理模型的测试时扩展能力，包含样本级感知和动态采样机制两个关键创新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着推理模型快速发展，需要系统性地比较和评估不同模型的测试时扩展能力，现有评估方法存在不足。

Method: 设计ARISE评估指标，包含样本级感知（惩罚负扩展行为）和动态采样机制（减少准确率波动和token计数不稳定性影响）。

Result: 在数学推理、代码生成和智能体任务等多个领域评估最先进推理模型，发现不同模型在扩展效率上存在显著差异。

Conclusion: ARISE能可靠且细粒度地测量测试时扩展能力，Claude Opus相比其他当代推理模型展现出更优的扩展特性。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a transformative paradigm for enhancing the
performance of large reasoning models, enabling dynamic allocation of
computational resources during inference. However, as the landscape of
reasoning models rapidly expands, a critical question remains: how can we
systematically compare and evaluate the test-time scaling capabilities across
different models? In this paper, we introduce ARISE (Adaptive Resolution-aware
Scaling Evaluation), a novel metric specifically designed to assess the
test-time scaling effectiveness of large reasoning models. Unlike existing
evaluation approaches, ARISE incorporates two key innovations: (1) sample-level
awareness that effectively penalizes negative scaling behaviors where increased
computation leads to performance degradation, and (2) a dynamic sampling
mechanism that mitigates the impact of accuracy fluctuations and token count
instability on the final assessment. We conduct comprehensive experiments
evaluating state-of-the-art reasoning models across diverse domains including
mathematical reasoning, code generation, and agentic tasks. Our results
demonstrate that ARISE provides a reliable and fine-grained measurement of
test-time scaling capabilities, revealing significant variations in scaling
efficiency across models. Notably, our evaluation identifies Claude Opus as
exhibiting superior scaling characteristics compared to other contemporary
reasoning models.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型推理模型存在"拒绝悬崖"现象：模型在推理过程中能正确识别有害提示并保持拒绝意图，但在输出前突然放弃拒绝。通过干预少量注意力头可显著提升安全性，并提出基于拒绝悬崖的数据选择方法，仅需1.7%训练数据即可达到同等安全效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型展现出强大的多步推理能力，但存在严重的安全漏洞且机制尚不清楚。本研究旨在从机制可解释性角度探究推理模型安全对齐失败的原因。

Method: 使用线性探测方法追踪拒绝意图在token位置的分布，识别"拒绝悬崖"现象；通过因果干预分析确定负向影响拒绝行为的稀疏注意力头；提出基于拒绝悬崖的数据选择方法Cliff-as-a-Judge。

Result: 发现许多对齐不良的推理模型在思考过程中能正确识别有害提示并保持拒绝意图，但在最终输出前拒绝分数急剧下降；仅消融3%的注意力头即可将攻击成功率降至10%以下；Cliff-as-a-Judge方法仅需1.7%的常规安全训练数据即可达到同等安全改进。

Conclusion: 推理模型的安全对齐失败不是由于模型本身不安全，而是拒绝意图被系统性抑制；通过机制性干预和高效数据选择，可以显著提升推理模型的安全性，展现出安全对齐中的"少即是多"效应。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) with multi-step reasoning capabilities have
shown remarkable problem-solving abilities, yet they exhibit concerning safety
vulnerabilities that remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate why
safety alignment fails in reasoning models through a mechanistic
interpretability lens. Using a linear probing approach to trace refusal
intentions across token positions, we discover a striking phenomenon termed as
\textbf{refusal cliff}: many poorly-aligned reasoning models correctly identify
harmful prompts and maintain strong refusal intentions during their thinking
process, but experience a sharp drop in refusal scores at the final tokens
before output generation. This suggests that these models are not inherently
unsafe; rather, their refusal intentions are systematically suppressed. Through
causal intervention analysis, we identify a sparse set of attention heads that
negatively contribute to refusal behavior. Ablating just 3\% of these heads can
reduce attack success rates below 10\%. Building on these mechanistic insights,
we propose \textbf{Cliff-as-a-Judge}, a novel data selection method that
identifies training examples exhibiting the largest refusal cliff to
efficiently repair reasoning models' safety alignment. This approach achieves
comparable safety improvements using only 1.7\% of the vanilla safety training
data, demonstrating a less-is-more effect in safety alignment.

TL;DR: MixReasoning框架通过动态调整推理深度，在困难步骤进行详细推理，在简单步骤进行简洁推理，从而缩短推理长度并提高效率，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推理模型对所有步骤采用相同程度的详细推理会引入大量冗余，因为子问题的难度和复杂度差异很大，只有少数关键步骤真正具有挑战性。

Method: 提出MixReasoning框架，在单个响应中动态调整推理深度，形成混合推理链：对困难步骤进行详细推理，对简单步骤进行简洁推理。

Result: 在GSM8K、MATH-500和AIME数据集上的实验表明，MixReasoning缩短了推理长度，显著提高了效率，且不影响准确性。

Conclusion: MixReasoning通过自适应调整推理深度，有效解决了推理冗余问题，在保持性能的同时大幅提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Reasoning models enhance performance by tackling problems in a step-by-step
manner, decomposing them into sub-problems and exploring long chains of thought
before producing an answer. However, applying extended reasoning to every step
introduces substantial redundancy, as sub-problems vary widely in difficulty
and complexity: a small number of pivotal steps are genuinely challenging and
decisive for the final answer, while many others only involve straightforward
revisions or simple computations. Therefore, a natural idea is to endow
reasoning models with the ability to adaptively respond to this variation,
rather than treating all steps with the same level of elaboration. To this end,
we propose MixReasoning, a framework that dynamically adjusts the depth of
reasoning within a single response. The resulting chain of thought then becomes
a mixture of detailed reasoning on difficult steps and concise inference on
simpler ones. Experiments on GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME show that MixReasoning
shortens reasoning length and substantially improves efficiency without
compromising accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有科学助手要么仅依赖算法进化（依赖LLM内部知识，在复杂领域快速达到瓶颈），要么仅进行深度研究（提出想法但缺乏验证，导致不切实际的解决方案），两者都有严重局限性。

Method: 集成深度研究与算法进化，包含外部知识检索、跨文件代码编辑和系统调试，通过反馈驱动的迭代循环，每个迭代不仅提出新假设，还进行精炼、实现和测试。

Result: 在化学、数学、生物学、材料和专利等9个基准测试中，DeepEvolve持续改进初始算法，产生可执行的新算法并保持持续增益。

Conclusion: 通过弥合无引导进化与无基础研究之间的差距，DeepEvolve为推进科学算法发现提供了一个可靠框架。

Abstract: Large language models hold promise as scientific assistants, yet existing
agents either rely solely on algorithm evolution or on deep research in
isolation, both of which face critical limitations. Pure algorithm evolution,
as in AlphaEvolve, depends only on the internal knowledge of LLMs and quickly
plateaus in complex domains, while pure deep research proposes ideas without
validation, resulting in unrealistic or unimplementable solutions. We present
DeepEvolve, an agent that integrates deep research with algorithm evolution,
uniting external knowledge retrieval, cross-file code editing, and systematic
debugging under a feedback-driven iterative loop. Each iteration not only
proposes new hypotheses but also refines, implements, and tests them, avoiding
both shallow improvements and unproductive over-refinements. Across nine
benchmarks in chemistry, mathematics, biology, materials, and patents,
DeepEvolve consistently improves the initial algorithm, producing executable
new algorithms with sustained gains. By bridging the gap between unguided
evolution and research without grounding, DeepEvolve provides a reliable
framework for advancing scientific algorithm discovery. Our code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可观测性数据在公共基准中代表性不足，现有数据集通常经过匿名化和归一化处理，移除了尺度信息，限制了在异常检测、根因分析和多模态推理等任务中的应用。

Method: 引入TelecomTS数据集，包含异构、去匿名化的协变量和明确的尺度信息，支持多种下游任务，并对最先进的时间序列、语言和推理模型进行基准测试。

Result: 实验表明现有方法难以处理可观测性数据的突发性、噪声性和高方差动态特性，同时强调了保留协变量绝对尺度信息的重要性。

Conclusion: 需要开发能够原生利用尺度信息的基础时间序列模型，以应对实际可观测性应用的需求。

Abstract: Modern enterprises generate vast streams of time series metrics when
monitoring complex systems, known as observability data. Unlike conventional
time series from domains such as weather, observability data are zero-inflated,
highly stochastic, and exhibit minimal temporal structure. Despite their
importance, observability datasets are underrepresented in public benchmarks
due to proprietary restrictions. Existing datasets are often anonymized and
normalized, removing scale information and limiting their use for tasks beyond
forecasting, such as anomaly detection, root-cause analysis, and multi-modal
reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce TelecomTS, a large-scale
observability dataset derived from a 5G telecommunications network. TelecomTS
features heterogeneous, de-anonymized covariates with explicit scale
information and supports a suite of downstream tasks, including anomaly
detection, root-cause analysis, and a question-answering benchmark requiring
multi-modal reasoning. Benchmarking state-of-the-art time series, language, and
reasoning models reveals that existing approaches struggle with the abrupt,
noisy, and high-variance dynamics of observability data. Our experiments also
underscore the importance of preserving covariates' absolute scale, emphasizing
the need for foundation time series models that natively leverage scale
information for practical observability applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统路由算法需要结构化输入且目标固定，无法适应自然语言查询；而基于LLM的方法虽然灵活但缺乏空间推理能力，难以同时建模路线级和POI级偏好。

Method: 采用分层多智能体框架：先解析用户查询为结构化意图，然后由管理者智能体协调约束智能体、POI智能体和路径优化智能体，最后通过验证智能体确保约束满足并生成可解释的路线。

Result: 实验表明该方法能可靠地将文本偏好转化为约束感知的路线，在路线质量和偏好满足度上优于传统方法。

Conclusion: RouteLLM成功连接了语言灵活性和空间结构，实现了对路线可行性和用户偏好的推理，提升了路线推荐的质量。

Abstract: Route recommendation aims to provide users with optimal travel plans that
satisfy diverse and complex requirements. Classical routing algorithms (e.g.,
shortest-path and constraint-aware search) are efficient but assume structured
inputs and fixed objectives, limiting adaptability to natural-language queries.
Recent LLM-based approaches enhance flexibility but struggle with spatial
reasoning and the joint modeling of route-level and POI-level preferences. To
address these limitations, we propose RouteLLM, a hierarchical multi-agent
framework that grounds natural-language intents into constraint-aware routes.
It first parses user queries into structured intents including POIs, paths, and
constraints. A manager agent then coordinates specialized sub-agents: a
constraint agent that resolves and formally check constraints, a POI agent that
retrieves and ranks candidate POIs, and a path refinement agent that refines
routes via a routing engine with preference-conditioned costs. A final verifier
agent ensures constraint satisfaction and produces the final route with an
interpretable rationale. This design bridges linguistic flexibility and spatial
structure, enabling reasoning over route feasibility and user preferences.
Experiments show that our method reliably grounds textual preferences into
constraint-aware routes, improving route quality and preference satisfaction
over classical methods.

Abstract: As algorithmic decision-makers are increasingly applied to high-stakes
domains, AI alignment research has evolved from a focus on universal value
alignment to context-specific approaches that account for decision-maker
attributes. Prior work on Decision-Maker Alignment (DMA) has explored two
primary strategies: (1) classical AI methods integrating case-based reasoning,
Bayesian reasoning, and naturalistic decision-making, and (2) large language
model (LLM)-based methods leveraging prompt engineering. While both approaches
have shown promise in limited domains such as medical triage, their
generalizability to novel contexts remains underexplored. In this work, we
implement a prior classical AI model and develop an LLM-based algorithmic
decision-maker evaluated using a large reasoning model (GPT-5) and a
non-reasoning model (GPT-4) with weighted self-consistency under a zero-shot
prompting framework, as proposed in recent literature. We evaluate both
approaches on a health insurance decision-making dataset annotated for three
target decision-makers with varying levels of risk tolerance (0.0, 0.5, 1.0).
In the experiments reported herein, classical AI and LLM-based models achieved
comparable alignment with attribute-based targets, with classical AI exhibiting
slightly better alignment for a moderate risk profile. The dataset and
open-source implementation are publicly available at:

### [162] [Pushing Test-Time Scaling Limits of Deep Search with Asymmetric Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06135)
*Weihao Zeng,Keqing He,Chuqiao Kuang,Xiaoguang Li,Junxian He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文研究了测试时计算扩展（TTS）策略，包括顺序扩展和并行扩展，利用验证比生成更容易的不对称验证特性，在深度搜索代理中实现了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在特定场景（如解决数独谜题）中，验证答案比生成答案更容易，这种不对称验证特性凸显了测试时扩展的巨大潜力。

Method: 结合顺序扩展（延长生成过程）和并行扩展（验证和选择多个候选输出）策略，利用不对称验证特性，为验证器分配适度计算资源。

Result: 通过TTS扩展的开源模型在BrowseComp基准上获得高达27个绝对百分点的提升，GLM-4.5 Heavy在BrowseComp和GAIA上分别达到54.0%和66.0%的准确率，与最佳专有模型相当；Tongyi-DeepResearch Heavy在BrowseComp上达到69.0%准确率，大幅超越专有模型。

Conclusion: 测试时计算扩展策略，特别是利用不对称验证特性，能够显著提升深度搜索代理的性能，使开源模型达到甚至超越专有模型的水平。

Abstract: Test-time compute can be scaled both sequentially and in parallel. Sequential
scaling involves lengthening the generation process, while parallel scaling
involves verifying and selecting among multiple candidate outputs. Combining
these two strategies has led to the most powerful AI systems, such as Grok 4
Heavy and GPT-5 Pro. In certain contexts (e.g., solving Sudoku puzzles),
verifying responses can be substantially easier than generating them. This
property, referred to as \emph{asymmetric verification}, highlights the strong
potential of test-time scaling (TTS). In this work, we study both sequential
and parallel TTS of deep search agents, motivated by the intuition that
verification in this setting is often much easier than generation. In
experiments, we first show that sequential scaling methods, such as budget
forcing, can be effective initially but soon degrade performance. Leveraging
asymmetric verification, however, we are able to achieve substantial
improvements by allocating only a modest amount of compute to the verifier. We
conduct experiments with flagship open-source models and extend them to their
``Heavy'' variants through TTS. These deep research agents achieve gains of up
to 27 absolute points on benchmarks such as BrowseComp. Remarkably, as an
open-source alternative, GLM-4.5 Heavy reaches accuracy of {\bf 54.0\%} on
BrowseComp and {\bf 66.0\%} on GAIA, placing it comparable to the best
proprietary choices such as OpenAI Deep Research. Tongyi-DeepResearch Heavy
further achieves {\bf 69.0\%} accuracy on BrowseComp, greatly surpassing the
best proprietary results.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了AI驱动的系统研究(ADRS)方法，通过自动生成、评估和优化算法解决方案，在多个系统领域超越了人类设计的算法性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统研究特别适合AI驱动的方法，因为系统性能问题天然具有可靠的验证器——可以通过运行软件实现来验证解决方案的有效性。

Method: 采用ADRS方法：迭代生成多样化解决方案，在真实系统或模拟器中验证性能，然后基于反馈不断优化算法。

Result: 在负载均衡、专家混合推理、LLM SQL查询和事务调度等多个领域，ADRS发现的算法显著优于最先进的人类设计，实现了最高5.0倍的运行时间改进和50%的成本降低。

Conclusion: AI将在算法设计中扮演核心角色，人类研究者需要转向问题制定和战略指导，系统研究实践需要适应AI时代的变化。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is starting to transform the research process as
we know it by automating the discovery of new solutions. Given a task, the
typical AI-driven approach is (i) to generate a set of diverse solutions, and
then (ii) to verify these solutions and select one that solves the problem.
Crucially, this approach assumes the existence of a reliable verifier, i.e.,
one that can accurately determine whether a solution solves the given problem.
We argue that systems research, long focused on designing and evaluating new
performance-oriented algorithms, is particularly well-suited for AI-driven
solution discovery. This is because system performance problems naturally admit
reliable verifiers: solutions are typically implemented in real systems or
simulators, and verification reduces to running these software artifacts
against predefined workloads and measuring performance. We term this approach
as AI-Driven Research for Systems (ADRS), which iteratively generates,
evaluates, and refines solutions. Using penEvolve, an existing open-source ADRS
instance, we present case studies across diverse domains, including load
balancing for multi-region cloud scheduling, Mixture-of-Experts inference,
LLM-based SQL queries, and transaction scheduling. In multiple instances, ADRS
discovers algorithms that outperform state-of-the-art human designs (e.g.,
achieving up to 5.0x runtime improvements or 50% cost reductions). We distill
best practices for guiding algorithm evolution, from prompt design to evaluator
construction, for existing frameworks. We then discuss the broader implications
for the systems community: as AI assumes a central role in algorithm design, we
argue that human researchers will increasingly focus on problem formulation and
strategic guidance. Our results highlight both the disruptive potential and the
urgent need to adapt systems research practices in the age of AI.

### [164] [TaTToo: Tool-Grounded Thinking PRM for Test-Time Scaling in Tabular Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06217)
*Jiaru Zou,Soumya Roy,Vinay Kumar Verma,Ziyi Wang,David Wipf,Pan Lu,Sumit Negi,James Zou,Jingrui He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TaTToo是一个针对表格推理的PRM框架，通过显式推理表格操作步骤和集成工具验证来提供精确奖励监督，在多个表格推理基准上显著提升下游模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的PRM虽然在文本推理步骤监督方面表现良好，但在处理表格特定操作（如子表检索和模式交互）时存在困难，导致性能瓶颈。

Method: 设计可扩展的数据标注流程构建6万多个高质量步骤级标注，采用双阶段训练范式：冷启动监督微调学习工具使用推理模式，然后通过工具基础的奖励塑形进行强化学习。

Result: 在5个具有挑战性的表格推理基准上，TaTToo将下游策略LRM的推理性能提升了30.9%，仅用8B参数就超越了72B参数的强基线模型，并在不同TTS策略上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: TaTToo框架通过表格基础的PRM设计和工具验证集成，有效解决了表格推理领域的监督瓶颈，为LRM在表格推理任务上的性能提升提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework
for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs),
particularly in the context of test-time scaling (TTS). However, their
potential for supervising LRMs on tabular reasoning domains remains
underexplored. Through detailed empirical analyses, we identify that existing
PRMs, though widely adopted for supervising text-only reasoning steps, struggle
with table-specific operations such as sub-table retrieval and schema
interaction, leading to critical performance bottlenecks. To address this
limitation, we propose TaTToo, a novel table-grounded PRM framework that (i)
reasons explicitly over tabular reasoning steps and (ii) integrates tool-based
verification to provide precise reward supervision. Concretely, we first design
a scalable data curation pipeline that constructs over 60k high-quality
step-level annotations by integrating table verification rationales with
tool-based executions. Building on the collected data, we train TaTToo with a
dual-stage paradigm: cold-start supervised fine-tuning to capture tool-use
reasoning patterns, followed by reinforcement learning with tool-grounded
reward shaping to align our model with table-based verification. We provide a
comprehensive evaluation of the policy improvement induced by our newly
designed PRM. Across 5 challenging tabular reasoning benchmarks covering
numerical reasoning, fact-checking, and data analysis, TaTToo improves
downstream policy LRMs by 30.9% at inference, surpasses strong PRM baselines
such as Qwen-2.5-Math-PRM-72B with only 8B parameters, and demonstrates strong
generalizability across diverse TTS strategies.

### [165] [Pricing Short-Circuit Current via a Primal-Dual Formulation for Preserving Integrality Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05293)
*Peng Wang,Luis Badesa*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于同步发电机短路电流(SCC)服务定价的原对偶方法，该方法在保持机组组合二进制约束的同时有效计算SCC服务的影子价格。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着同步发电机被功率电子发电替代，需要优化剩余同步发电机提供的短路电流服务。现有定价方法在处理机组组合的整数约束时存在局限性，导致SCC价格无法覆盖机组运行成本或缺乏可解释性。

Method: 提出了SCC约束调度的原对偶公式，保留了机组组合的二进制特性，同时有效计算SCC服务的影子价格。

Result: 在改进的IEEE 30节点系统上进行的比较表明，原对偶方法在保持机组组合整数性用于SCC定价方面具有优势。

Conclusion: 所提出的原对偶方法能够克服现有定价方案的局限性，为短路电流服务提供更合理的定价机制。

Abstract: Synchronous Generators (SGs) currently provide important levels of
Short-Circuit Current (SCC), a critical ancillary service that ensures line
protections trip during short-circuit faults. Given the ongoing replacement of
SGs by power-electronics-based generation, which have a hard limit for current
injection, it has become relevant to optimize the procurement of SCC provided
by remaining SGs. Pricing this service is however challenging due to the
integrality constraints in Unit Commitment (UC). Existing methods, e.g.,
dispatchable pricing, restricted pricing and marginal unit pricing, attempt to
address this issue but exhibit limitations in handling binary variables,
resulting in SCC prices that either fail to cover the operating costs of units
or lack interpretability. To overcome these pitfalls, we propose a primal-dual
formulation of the SCC-constrained dispatch that preserves the binary nature of
UC while effectively computing shadow prices of SCC services. Using a modified
IEEE 30-bus system, a comparison is carried out between the proposed approach
and the state-of-the-art pricing schemes, highlighting the advantages of the
primal-dual method in preserving UC integrality for SCC pricing.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在检测性能因环境因素而随机变化且存在误报的情况下，通过使用滤波器来减轻影响的传感器布局问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决在动态不确定环境中，由于空间和时间上的环境因素导致检测性能随机变化，同时存在误报干扰时的传感器优化布局问题。

Method: 引入了一个统一模型，通过可用性函数将检测和误报耦合起来，该函数捕捉了误报如何减少有效感知和滤波器对干扰的响应。

Result: 给出了滤波器改善检测的充分条件，推导了覆盖基的空白概率下界，证明了在从有限数据学习检测概率时的性能鲁棒性保证。

Conclusion: 通过AIS船舶交通数据和合成海上场景的数值研究验证了该方法，为在动态不确定环境中部署传感器提供了理论和实践指导。

Abstract: This paper studies sensor placement when detection performance varies
stochastically due to environmental factors over space and time and false
alarms are present, but a filter is used to attenuate the effect. We introduce
a unified model that couples detection and false alarms through an availability
function, which captures how false alarms reduce effective sensing and
filtering responses to the disturbance. Building on this model, we give a
sufficient condition under which filtering improves detection. In addition, we
derive a coverage-based lower bound on the void probability. Furthermore, we
prove robustness guarantees showing that performance remains stable when
detection probabilities are learned from limited data. We validate the approach
with numerical studies using AIS vessel-traffic data and synthetic maritime
scenarios. Together, these results provide theory and practical guidance for
deploying sensors in dynamic, uncertain environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Koopman算子为自治系统提供全局线性化，但非自治系统在输入方面并非全局线性，导致状态反馈控制器设计保持非凸性。

Method: 引入Koopman控制分解，将控制仿射系统与基于非线性测量的反馈控制器参数化，使闭环系统的Koopman算子成为两个矩阵系数的双线性组合。

Conclusion: 该方法为非线性系统稳定控制提供了一种快速计算、可验证稳定、数据驱动且不依赖近似的通用控制综合方法。

Abstract: Although Koopman operators provide a global linearization for autonomous
dynamical systems, nonautonomous systems are not globally linear in the inputs.
State (or output) feedback controller design therefore remains nonconvex in
typical formulations, even with approximations via bilinear control-affine
terms. We address this gap by introducing the Koopman Control Factorization, a
novel parameterization of control-affine dynamical systems combined with a
feedback controller defined as a linear combination of nonlinear measurements.
With this choice, the Koopman operator of the closed-loop system is a bilinear
combination of the coefficients in two matrices: one representing the system,
and the other the controller. We propose a set of sufficient conditions such
that the factorization holds. Then, we present an algorithm that calculates the
feedback matrix via semi-definite programming, producing a Lyapunov-stable
closed-loop system with convex optimization. We evaluate the proposed
controllers on two canonical examples of control-affine nonlinear systems
(inverted pendulums), and show that our factorization and controller
successfully stabilize both under properly-chosen basis functions. This
manuscript introduces a broadly generalizable control synthesis method for
stabilization of nonlinear systems that is quick-to-compute, verifiably stable,
data-driven, and does not rely on approximations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 备份控制屏障函数(bCBFs)虽然能保证控制器安全性和输入约束，但需要在线求解高维二次规划，计算成本高，不适合计算资源受限的系统如航空航天器。

Method: 提出最优插值方法，在标称控制器和备份控制器之间进行插值，推导出该优化问题的闭式解，避免在线求解二次规划。

Result: 证明了闭式控制器在保证安全性的同时满足输入约束，并在双积分器和非线性固定翼飞机模型上验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种计算高效的安全控制器设计框架，特别适用于计算资源受限的实时系统。

Abstract: Verifying the safety of controllers is critical for many applications, but is
especially challenging for systems with bounded inputs. Backup control barrier
functions (bCBFs) offer a structured approach to synthesizing safe controllers
that are guaranteed to satisfy input bounds by leveraging the knowledge of a
backup controller. While powerful, bCBFs require solving a high-dimensional
quadratic program at run-time, which may be too costly for
computationally-constrained systems such as aerospace vehicles. We propose an
approach that optimally interpolates between a nominal controller and the
backup controller, and we derive the solution to this optimization problem in
closed form. We prove that this closed-form controller is guaranteed to be safe
while obeying input bounds. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on
a double integrator and a nonlinear fixed-wing aircraft example.

Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamic interactions between large-scale data
centers and the power grid, focusing on reliability challenges arising from
sudden fluctuations in demand. With the rapid growth of AI-driven workloads,
such fluctuations, along with fast ramp patterns, are expected to exacerbate
stressed grid conditions and system instabilities. We consider a few
open-source AI data center consumption profiles from the MIT supercloud
datasets, along with generating a few experimental HPC job-distribution-based
inference profiles. Subsequently, we develop analytical methodologies for
real-time assessment of grid stability, focusing on both transient and
small-signal stability assessments. Energy-flow-like metrics for nonlinear
transient stability, formulated by computing localized data center bus
kinetic-like flows and coupling interactions with neighboring buses over
varying time windows, help provide operators a real-time assessments of the
regional grid stress in the data center hubs. On the other hand, small-signal
stability metrics, constructed from analytical state matrices under variable
operating conditions during a fast ramping period, enable snapshot-based
assessments of data center load fluctuations, provide enhanced observability
into evolving grid conditions. By quantifying the stability impacts of large
data center clusters, studies conducted in the modified IEEE benchmark $68-$bus
model support improved operator situational awareness to capture risks in
reliable integration of large data center loads.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出了一种具有正式安全保证的四旋翼轨迹跟踪级联控制框架，通过外环位置MPC和内环非线性姿态控制实现位置安全与偏航方向的解耦，采用采样数据高阶控制屏障函数保证安全性。

Abstract: This paper proposes a cascaded control framework for quadrotor trajectory
tracking with formal safety guarantees. First, we design a controller
consisting of an outer-loop position model predictive control (MPC) and an
inner-loop nonlinear attitude control, enabling decoupling of position safety
and yaw orientation. Second, since quadrotor safety constraints often involve
high relative degree, we adopt high order control barrier functions (HOCBFs) to
guarantee safety. To employ HOCBFs in the MPC formulation that has formal
guarantees, we extend HOCBFs to sampled-data HOCBF (SdHOCBFs) by introducing
compensation terms, ensuring safety over the entire sampling interval. We show
that embedding SdHOCBFs as control-affine constraints into the MPC formulation
guarantees both safety and optimality while preserving convexity for real-time
implementations. Finally, comprehensive simulations are conducted to
demonstrate the safety guarantee and high efficiency of the proposed method
compared to existing methods.

TL;DR: 提出确定性采样CEM（dsCEM）框架，用基于局部累积分布的确定性采样替代传统CEM-MPC中的随机采样，提升控制性能和平滑度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CEM-MPC依赖随机采样导致解空间探索效率低、控制输入不平滑，需要大量样本才能获得满意结果。

Method: 使用局部累积分布生成确定性样本，引入模块化方案生成和调整样本集，结合时间相关性确保控制轨迹平滑。

Result: 在两个非线性控制任务上的实验表明，dsCEM在累积成本和控制输入平滑度方面持续优于最先进的iCEM，特别是在低样本情况下表现更佳。

Conclusion: dsCEM可作为现有CEM控制器的即插即用替代方案，显著提升控制性能，尤其在样本受限场景下优势明显。

Abstract: Cross-entropy method model predictive control (CEM--MPC) is a powerful
gradient-free technique for nonlinear optimal control, but its performance is
often limited by the reliance on random sampling. This conventional approach
can lead to inefficient exploration of the solution space and non-smooth
control inputs, requiring a large number of samples to achieve satisfactory
results. To address these limitations, we propose deterministic sampling CEM
(dsCEM), a novel framework that replaces the random sampling step with
deterministic samples derived from localized cumulative distributions (LCDs).
Our approach introduces modular schemes to generate and adapt these sample
sets, incorporating temporal correlations to ensure smooth control
trajectories. This method can be used as a drop-in replacement for the sampling
step in existing CEM-based controllers. Experimental evaluations on two
nonlinear control tasks demonstrate that dsCEM consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art iCEM in terms of cumulative cost and control input smoothness,
particularly in the critical low-sample regime.

Conclusion: 该控制方法结合了轨迹跟踪和形式化安全保证，适合自主小行星任务，允许执行激进机动而不牺牲安全性

Abstract: Soft landing on small celestial bodies (SCBs) poses unique challenges, as
uncertainties in gravitational models and poorly characterized, dynamic
environments require a high level of autonomy. Existing control approaches lack
formal guarantees for safety constraint satisfaction, necessary to ensure the
safe execution of the maneuvers. This paper introduces a control that addresses
this limitation by integrating trajectory tracking, disturbance estimation, and
safety enforcement. An extended high-gain observer is employed to estimate
disturbances resulting from gravitational model uncertainties. We then apply a
feedback-linearizing and disturbance-canceling controller that achieves
exponential tracking of reference trajectories. Finally, we use a control
barrier function based minimum-intervention controller to enforce state and
input constraints through out the maneuver execution. This control combines
trajectory tracking of offline generated reference trajectories with formal
guarantees of safety, which follows common guidance and control architectures
for spacecraft and allows aggressive maneuvers to be executed without
compromising safety. Numerical simulations using fuel-optimal trajectories
demonstrate the effectiveness of the controller in achieving precise and safe
soft-landing, highlighting its potential for autonomous SCB missions.

TL;DR: 本文研究了分布式车队控制中的稳定性和隐私保护特性，比较了确定性和概率性量化器在车辆编队控制中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式车辆控制需要共享隐私敏感的车辆数据，这带来了信息泄露和恶意活动的风险，因此需要研究如何在保持控制性能的同时保护隐私。

Method: 分析两种量化器：确定性量化器确保系统误差一致最终有界，概率性量化器实现车队在期望中的渐近收敛，并能满足差分隐私保证。

Result: 确定性量化器下，窃听者无法唯一推断敏感车辆状态；概率性量化器能提供更强的隐私保护，即使窃听者拥有任意辅助信息。

Conclusion: 两种量化策略在控制性能和隐私保护之间存在权衡，通过优化问题可以表征量化步长对这两个指标的影响。

Abstract: Distributed control of connected and automated vehicles has attracted
considerable interest for its potential to improve traffic efficiency and
safety. However, such control schemes require sharing privacy-sensitive vehicle
data, which introduces risks of information leakage and potential malicious
activities. This paper investigates the stability and privacy-preserving
properties of distributed platoon control under two types of quantizers:
deterministic and probabilistic. For deterministic quantization, we show that
the resulting control strategy ensures the system errors remain uniformly
ultimately bounded. Moreover, in the absence of auxiliary information, an
eavesdropper cannot uniquely infer sensitive vehicle states. In contrast, the
use of probabilistic quantization enables asymptotic convergence of the vehicle
platoon in expectation with bounded variance. Importantly, probabilistic
quantizers can satisfy differential privacy guarantees, thereby preserving
privacy even when the eavesdropper possesses arbitrary auxiliary information.
We further analyze the trade-off between control performance and privacy by
formulating an optimization problem that characterizes the impact of the
quantization step on both metrics. Numerical simulations are provided to
illustrate the performance differences between the two quantization strategies.

Abstract: Stochastic processing networks (SPNs) have broad applications in healthcare,
transportation, and communication networks. The control of SPN is to
dynamically assign servers in batches under uncertainty to optimize long-run
performance. This problem is challenging as the policy dimension grows
exponentially with the number of servers, making standard reinforcement
learning and policy optimization methods intractable at scale. We propose an
atomic action decomposition framework that addresses this scalability challenge
by breaking joint assignments into sequential single-server assignments. This
yields policies with constant dimension, independent of the number of servers.
We study two classes of atomic policies, the step-dependent and
step-independent atomic policies, and prove that both achieve the same optimal
long-run average reward as the original joint policies. These results establish
that computing the optimal SPN control can be made scalable without loss of
optimality using the atomic framework. Our results offer theoretical
justification for the strong empirical success of the atomic framework in
large-scale applications reported in previous articles.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对具有执行器动力学和网络延迟的差速驱动机器人方向角控制的三层非线性控制方案，通过延迟依赖的动态输出反馈控制器实现精确模型匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决远程控制差速驱动机器人在存在执行器动力学和网络诱导延迟时的方向角调节问题，为延迟机器人系统提供基于分析的控制器设计替代方案。

Method: 在已有的两层非线性控制方案基础上，引入第三层延迟依赖的动态可测量输出反馈控制器，包含动态适当预补偿器，通过参数化获得具有稳定性约束的简单特征拟多项式。

Result: 计算实验证实了准确的跟踪性能、快速稳定性和有界的内部信号及控制电压。

Conclusion: 该方法为延迟机器人系统提供了一种基于分析的设计替代方案，可替代基于AI的调参方法。

Abstract: The problem of regulation of the orientation angle of a remotely controlled
differential-drive mobile robot with actuator dynamics and network-induced
delays is studied. Using a preinstalled two-layer nonlinear control scheme that
decouples linear and angular velocities and regulates heading, a third,
delay-dependent layer that achieves exact model matching from the orientation
angle command to the orientation angle is introduced. The proposed outer loop
controller is a delay dependent dynamic measurable output-feedback controller
with dynamic proper precompensator. Parameterization yields a simple
characteristic quasi-polynomial with coefficients constrained to satisfy
stability for all delays up to a computable bound. Computational experiments
confirm accurate tracking, fast settling and bounded internal signals and
control voltages. The approach offers an analytic design alternative to
AI-based tuning for delayed robotic systems.

TL;DR: 提出并测试了基于GaAs的多段光伏电池，作为能量收集器和数据探测器，通过分割有源区域减少电容并提高带宽，在1.5米光学无线链路中实现了3.8Gbps的世界纪录数据速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 满足对节能高速无线通信的需求，结合物联网设备的快速增长，需要将能量收集与光学数据接收集成以消除充电或更换电池的需求。

Method: 将GaAs基光伏电池的有源区域分割成2、4或6个子电池，形成直径1、1.5或2.08mm的圆形区域，通过刻蚀沟槽进行电隔离，串联连接的子电池优化吸收并最小化寄生效应。

Result: 在1.5米光学无线链路中使用OFDM和自适应比特与功率加载，实现了3.8Gbps的世界纪录数据速率，比先前工作提高了四倍，将2.3mW光束的39.7%光功率转换为电能。

Conclusion: 这些发现为未来通信网络（如6G蜂窝）的离网回程提供了新的解决方案，尽管分割增加了对准的敏感性。

Abstract: The demand for energy-efficient high-speed wireless communication, coupled
with the rapid rise of IoT devices, requires systems that integrate power
harvesting with optical data reception to eliminate the need for charging or
battery replacements. Recent advances have explored the use of solar cells as
optical receivers for high-speed data detection alongside power harvesting.
\acs{GaAs}-based \acp{PPC} provide six times greater electron mobility than
silicon- or cadmium telluride-based cells, enabling faster data detection and
improved power efficiency. However, their bandwidth is constrained by junction
capacitance, which increases with active area, creating a trade-off between
power output and data rate. To address this, we propose and test multi-segment
\acs{GaAs}-based \Acp{PPC} that serve as both energy harvesters and data
detectors. By segmenting the active area into 2, 4, or 6 subcells, forming
circular areas with diameters of 1, 1.5, or 2.08~mm, we reduce capacitance and
boost bandwidth while preserving light collection. Fabricated on a
semi-insulating \ac{GaAs} substrate with etched trenches for electrical
isolation, the series-connected subcells optimize absorption and minimize
parasitic effects. The \Acp{PPC} were used for an eye-safe 1.5~m optical
wireless link, employing \ac{OFDM} with adaptive bit and power loading. The
system achieved a world record data rate of 3.8~Gbps, which is four times
higher than prior works. The system converts 39.7\% of optical power from a
beam of 2.3~mW, although the segmentation increases the sensitivity of the
alignment. These findings provide new solutions for off-grid backhaul for
future communication networks, such as 6th generation (6G) cellular.

TL;DR: 提出了一个信息论框架来检测多智能体LLM系统中的高阶结构，通过实验证明可以通过提示设计将多智能体系统从简单聚合引导为高阶集体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多智能体LLM系统何时仅仅是独立智能体的集合，何时是具有高阶结构的集成集体，需要数据驱动的方法来检测动态涌现现象。

Method: 使用时间延迟互信息的部分信息分解实现实用标准和涌现能力标准，通过简单的猜谜游戏实验，采用三种随机干预措施。

Result: 控制组显示强时间协同但协调对齐较少；分配角色引入稳定身份差异化；结合角色和思考他人行为的指令显示身份差异化和目标导向的互补性。

Conclusion: 多智能体LLM系统可以通过提示设计从简单聚合转向高阶集体，观察到的交互模式反映了人类群体集体智能的原则：有效表现需要共享目标的对齐和成员间的互补贡献。

Abstract: When are multi-agent LLM systems merely a collection of individual agents
versus an integrated collective with higher-order structure? We introduce an
information-theoretic framework to test -- in a purely data-driven way --
whether multi-agent systems show signs of higher-order structure. This
information decomposition lets us measure whether dynamical emergence is
present in multi-agent LLM systems, localize it, and distinguish spurious
temporal coupling from performance-relevant cross-agent synergy. We implement
both a practical criterion and an emergence capacity criterion operationalized
as partial information decomposition of time-delayed mutual information (TDMI).
We apply our framework to experiments using a simple guessing game without
direct agent communication and only minimal group-level feedback with three
randomized interventions. Groups in the control condition exhibit strong
temporal synergy but only little coordinated alignment across agents. Assigning
a persona to each agent introduces stable identity-linked differentiation.
Combining personas with an instruction to ``think about what other agents might
do'' shows identity-linked differentiation and goal-directed complementarity
across agents. Taken together, our framework establishes that multi-agent LLM
systems can be steered with prompt design from mere aggregates to higher-order
collectives. Our results are robust across emergence measures and entropy
estimators, and not explained by coordination-free baselines or temporal
dynamics alone. Without attributing human-like cognition to the agents, the
patterns of interaction we observe mirror well-established principles of
collective intelligence in human groups: effective performance requires both
alignment on shared objectives and complementary contributions across members.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过整合认知、情感和社会机制，更好地模拟分散性集体暴力的复杂动态，理解微观层面的认知异质性如何塑造宏观层面的冲突模式。

Method: 基于Epstein的Agent_Zero框架，在Python中使用Mesa ABM框架实现，引入了八项行为增强：年龄冲动控制、记忆风险估计、情感认知耦合、内生破坏半径、战斗或逃跑动态、情感同质性、报复性伤害和多代理协调。

Result: 模型能够产生涌现动态，如抗议不对称、升级周期和局部报复，结果显示记忆、反应性和情感对齐的微小变化可以通过反馈循环放大或抑制动荡。

Conclusion: 通过明确建模情感阈值、身份驱动行为和自适应网络，该工作为分析情感传染和心理基础的集体行动提供了一个灵活可扩展的平台。

Abstract: We present AgentZero++, an agent-based model that integrates cognitive,
emotional, and social mechanisms to simulate decentralized collective violence
in spatially distributed systems. Building on Epstein's Agent\_Zero framework,
we extend the original model with eight behavioral enhancements: age-based
impulse control; memory-based risk estimation; affect-cognition coupling;
endogenous destructive radius; fight-or-flight dynamics; affective homophily;
retaliatory damage; and multi-agent coordination. These additions allow agents
to adapt based on internal states, previous experiences, and social feedback,
producing emergent dynamics such as protest asymmetries, escalation cycles, and
localized retaliation. Implemented in Python using the Mesa ABM framework,
AgentZero++ enables modular experimentation and visualization of how
micro-level cognitive heterogeneity shapes macro-level conflict patterns. Our
results highlight how small variations in memory, reactivity, and affective
alignment can amplify or dampen unrest through feedback loops. By explicitly
modeling emotional thresholds, identity-driven behavior, and adaptive networks,
this work contributes a flexible and extensible platform for analyzing
affective contagion and psychologically grounded collective action.

TL;DR: AGENT+P是一个利用符号规划指导LLM UI代理的框架，通过构建UI转换图将UI自动化任务转化为路径查找问题，显著提升任务成功率和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM UI代理在长视野任务中容易产生幻觉，缺乏对全局UI转换结构的理解，导致性能下降。

Method: 将应用的UI转换结构建模为UI转换图，将UI自动化任务重新定义为UTG上的路径查找问题，使用现成的符号规划器生成高层计划。

Result: 在AndroidWorld基准测试中，AGENT+P将最先进UI代理的成功率提升高达14%，动作步骤减少37.7%。

Conclusion: AGENT+P作为一个即插即用框架，能有效增强现有UI代理，防止冗余探索并指导代理实现自动化目标。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based UI agents show great promise for UI
automation but often hallucinate in long-horizon tasks due to their lack of
understanding of the global UI transition structure. To address this, we
introduce AGENT+P, a novel framework that leverages symbolic planning to guide
LLM-based UI agents. Specifically, we model an app's UI transition structure as
a UI Transition Graph (UTG), which allows us to reformulate the UI automation
task as a pathfinding problem on the UTG. This further enables an off-the-shelf
symbolic planner to generate a provably correct and optimal high-level plan,
preventing the agent from redundant exploration and guiding the agent to
achieve the automation goals. AGENT+P is designed as a plug-and-play framework
to enhance existing UI agents. Evaluation on the AndroidWorld benchmark
demonstrates that AGENT+P improves the success rates of state-of-the-art UI
agents by up to 14% and reduces the action steps by 37.7%.

TL;DR: VER是一个用于机器人学习的视觉专家变换器，通过蒸馏多个视觉基础模型构建专家库，仅微调轻量级路由网络来动态选择任务相关专家，在17个机器人任务中实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉基础模型通常只在特定领域表现优异，限制了跨任务的泛化能力。将多个VFM蒸馏到统一表示中虽然能缓解这一问题，但会产生不灵活的任务特定特征选择，且需要昂贵的完整重新训练来整合机器人领域知识。

Method: 提出VER方法：1）预训练阶段蒸馏多个VFM构建视觉专家库；2）仅微调轻量级路由网络（少于0.4%参数）动态选择任务相关专家；3）引入补丁级专家路由与课程Top-K退火提升动态专家选择的灵活性和精度；4）支持参数高效微调以实现可扩展的专家利用和自适应机器人领域知识整合。

Result: 在17个多样化机器人任务和多个策略头中，VER实现了最先进的性能。VER减少了任务无关区域（如背景）的大范数异常值，并集中在任务关键区域。

Conclusion: VER通过动态专家选择和高效微调机制，成功解决了多VFM集成中的灵活性和可扩展性问题，为机器人学习提供了强大的视觉表示解决方案。

Abstract: Pretrained vision foundation models (VFMs) advance robotic learning via rich
visual representations, yet individual VFMs typically excel only in specific
domains, limiting generality across tasks. Distilling multiple VFMs into a
unified representation for policy can mitigate this limitation but often yields
inflexible task-specific feature selection and requires costly full re-training
to incorporate robot-domain knowledge. We propose VER, a Vision Expert
transformer for Robot learning. During pretraining, VER distills multiple VFMs
into a vision expert library. It then fine-tunes only a lightweight routing
network (fewer than 0.4% of parameters) to dynamically select task-relevant
experts from the pretrained library for downstream robot tasks. We further
introduce Patchwise Expert Routing with Curriculum Top-K Annealing to improve
both flexibility and precision of dynamic expert selection. Moreover, VER
supports parameter-efficient finetuning for scalable expert utilization and
adaptive robot-domain knowledge integration. Across 17 diverse robotic tasks
and multiple policy heads, VER achieves state-of-the-art performance. We find
that VER reduces large-norm outliers in task-irrelevant regions (e.g.,
background) and concentrates on task-critical regions. Visualizations and codes
can be found in https://yixiaowang7.github.io/ver_page/.

TL;DR: 提出自适应动力学规划（ADP），通过强化学习动态调整机器人动力学特性，使规划器能适应不同环境复杂度，提高导航成功率、安全性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分层规划中全局规划器不考虑动力学，局部规划器处理动力学约束，这种动力学不连续性在受限环境中容易导致轨迹跟踪失败。现有方法虽然集成了动力学但采用静态设置，无法适应环境复杂度变化。

Method: 使用强化学习动态调整机器人动力学属性，将ADP集成到三种不同规划器中，并设计了独立的ADP导航系统。

Result: 在仿真和真实世界测试中，ADP持续提高了导航成功率、安全性和效率。

Conclusion: ADP通过学习增强的范式，使规划器能够跨不同环境自适应调整动力学，有效解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Autonomous robot navigation systems often rely on hierarchical planning,
where global planners compute collision-free paths without considering
dynamics, and local planners enforce dynamics constraints to produce executable
commands. This discontinuity in dynamics often leads to trajectory tracking
failure in highly constrained environments. Recent approaches integrate
dynamics within the entire planning process by gradually decreasing its
fidelity, e.g., increasing integration steps and reducing collision checking
resolution, for real-time planning efficiency. However, they assume that the
fidelity of the dynamics should decrease according to a manually designed
scheme. Such static settings fail to adapt to environmental complexity
variations, resulting in computational overhead in simple environments or
insufficient dynamics consideration in obstacle-rich scenarios. To overcome
this limitation, we propose Adaptive Dynamics Planning (ADP), a
learning-augmented paradigm that uses reinforcement learning to dynamically
adjust robot dynamics properties, enabling planners to adapt across diverse
environments. We integrate ADP into three different planners and further design
a standalone ADP-based navigation system, benchmarking them against other
baselines. Experiments in both simulation and real-world tests show that ADP
consistently improves navigation success, safety, and efficiency.

Abstract: Federated split learning (FedSL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
enabling collaborative intelligence in industrial Internet of Things (IoT)
systems, particularly in smart factories where data privacy, communication
efficiency, and device heterogeneity are critical concerns. In this article, we
present a comprehensive study of FedSL frameworks tailored for
resource-constrained robots in industrial scenarios. We compare synchronous,
asynchronous, hierarchical, and heterogeneous FedSL frameworks in terms of
workflow, scalability, adaptability, and limitations under dynamic industrial
conditions. Furthermore, we systematically categorize token fusion strategies
into three paradigms: input-level (pre-fusion), intermediate-level
(intra-fusion), and output-level (post-fusion), and summarize their respective
strengths in industrial applications. We also provide adaptive optimization
techniques to enhance the efficiency and feasibility of FedSL implementation,
including model compression, split layer selection, computing frequency
allocation, and wireless resource management. Simulation results validate the
performance of these frameworks under industrial detection scenarios. Finally,
we outline open issues and research directions of FedSL in future smart
manufacturing systems.

Motivation: 当前触觉传感在机器人手中的应用受限，主要由于传感器成本高、制造和集成困难，以及从信号中提取可靠信息的挑战。

Method: 使用应变片传感器捕捉静态力，接触式麦克风传感器测量高频振动，所有传感器集成在指尖内部以避免直接磨损。

Conclusion: 多模态触觉传感可以灵活应用于不同操作阶段，单独或与视觉观察结合使用，显著提升任务性能，如精确计数和堆叠纸杯达到100%成功率。

Abstract: Tactile sensing holds great promise for enhancing manipulation precision and
versatility, but its adoption in robotic hands remains limited due to high
sensor costs, manufacturing and integration challenges, and difficulties in
extracting expressive and reliable information from signals. In this work, we
present a low-cost, easy-to-make, adaptable, and compact fingertip design for
robotic hands that integrates multi-modal tactile sensors. We use strain gauge
sensors to capture static forces and a contact microphone sensor to measure
high-frequency vibrations during contact. These tactile sensors are integrated
into a compact design with a minimal sensor footprint, and all sensors are
internal to the fingertip and therefore not susceptible to direct wear and tear
from interactions. From sensor characterization, we show that strain gauge
sensors provide repeatable 2D planar force measurements in the 0-5 N range and
the contact microphone sensor has the capability to distinguish contact
material properties. We apply our design to three dexterous manipulation tasks
that range from zero to full visual occlusion. Given the expressiveness and
reliability of tactile sensor readings, we show that different tactile sensing
modalities can be used flexibly in different stages of manipulation, solely or
together with visual observations to achieve improved task performance. For
instance, we can precisely count and unstack a desired number of paper cups
from a stack with 100\% success rate which is hard to achieve with vision only.

Motivation: 工作环境往往不适合且缺乏对上半身残疾个体的包容性。传统人机协作方法假设用户身体健全，无法满足上肢移动障碍用户的需求。

Method: 将特定关节限制的移动性模型整合到分层最优控制器中，使机器人能够在线生成反应性、移动感知行为，并引导用户受损肢体利用残余功能移动性。

Result: 在涉及不同上肢移动障碍（模拟肘部和肩部关节炎、腕部阻塞）的交接任务中测试，框架能够个性化交互以适应用户的受损运动范围，并根据功能限制的严重程度鼓励关节使用。

Conclusion: 该框架能够促进上肢残疾用户的积极参与工作，通过个性化的人机交互适应其移动限制。

Abstract: Work environments are often inadequate and lack inclusivity for individuals
with upper-body disabilities. This paper presents a novel online framework for
adaptive human-robot interaction (HRI) that accommodates users' arm mobility
impairments, ultimately aiming to promote active work participation. Unlike
traditional human-robot collaboration approaches that assume able-bodied users,
our method integrates a mobility model for specific joint limitations into a
hierarchical optimal controller. This allows the robot to generate reactive,
mobility-aware behaviour online and guides the user's impaired limb to exploit
residual functional mobility. The framework was tested in handover tasks
involving different upper-limb mobility impairments (i.e., emulated elbow and
shoulder arthritis, and wrist blockage), under both standing and seated
configurations with task constraints using a mobile manipulator, and
complemented by quantitative and qualitative comparisons with state-of-the-art
ergonomic HRI approaches. Preliminary results indicated that the framework can
personalise the interaction to fit within the user's impaired range of motion
and encourage joint usage based on the severity of their functional
limitations.

Abstract: We develop an approach for active semantic perception which refers to using
the semantics of the scene for tasks such as exploration. We build a compact,
hierarchical multi-layer scene graph that can represent large, complex indoor
environments at various levels of abstraction, e.g., nodes corresponding to
rooms, objects, walls, windows etc. as well as fine-grained details of their
geometry. We develop a procedure based on large language models (LLMs) to
sample plausible scene graphs of unobserved regions that are consistent with
partial observations of the scene. These samples are used to compute an
information gain of a potential waypoint for sophisticated spatial reasoning,
e.g., the two doors in the living room can lead to either a kitchen or a
bedroom. We evaluate this approach in complex, realistic 3D indoor environments
in simulation. We show using qualitative and quantitative experiments that our
approach can pin down the semantics of the environment quicker and more
accurately than baseline approaches.

Abstract: Mobile robots, such as ground vehicles and quadrotors, are becoming
increasingly important in various fields, from logistics to agriculture, where
they automate processes in environments that are difficult to access for
humans. However, to perform effectively in uncertain environments using
model-based controllers, these systems require dynamics models capable of
responding to environmental variations, especially when direct access to
environmental information is limited. To enable such adaptivity and facilitate
integration with model predictive control, we propose an adaptive dynamics
model which bypasses the need for direct environmental knowledge by inferring
operational environments from state-action history. The dynamics model is based
on neural ordinary equations, and a two-phase training procedure is used to
learn latent environment representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach through goal-reaching and path-tracking tasks on three robotic
platforms of increasing complexity: a 2D differential wheeled robot with
changing wheel contact conditions, a 3D quadrotor in variational wind fields,
and the Sphero BOLT robot under two contact conditions for real-world
deployment. Empirical results corroborate that our method can handle temporally
and spatially varying environmental changes in both simulation and real-world
systems.

Abstract: Accurate pose and velocity estimation is essential for effective spatial task
planning in robotic manipulators. While centralized sensor fusion has
traditionally been used to improve pose estimation accuracy, this paper
presents a novel decentralized fusion approach to estimate both pose and
velocity. We use dual-view measurements from an eye-in-hand and an eye-to-hand
vision sensor configuration mounted on a manipulator to track a target object
whose motion is modeled as random walk (stochastic acceleration model). The
robot runs two independent adaptive extended Kalman filters formulated on a
matrix Lie group, developed as part of this work. These filters predict poses
and velocities on the manifold $\mathbb{SE}(3) \times \mathbb{R}^3 \times
\mathbb{R}^3$ and update the state on the manifold $\mathbb{SE}(3)$. The final
fused state comprising the fused pose and velocities of the target is obtained
using a correlation-aware fusion rule on Lie groups. The proposed method is
evaluated on a UFactory xArm 850 equipped with Intel RealSense cameras,
tracking a moving target. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and
robustness of the proposed decentralized dual-view estimation framework,
showing consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: We present ARRC (Advanced Reasoning Robot Control), a practical system that
connects natural-language instructions to safe local robotic control by
combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with RGB-D perception and
guarded execution on an affordable robot arm. The system indexes curated robot
knowledge (movement patterns, task templates, and safety heuristics) in a
vector database, retrieves task-relevant context for each instruction, and
conditions a large language model (LLM) to produce JSON-structured action
plans. Plans are executed on a UFactory xArm 850 fitted with a Dynamixel-driven
parallel gripper and an Intel RealSense D435 camera. Perception uses AprilTag
detections fused with depth to produce object-centric metric poses. Execution
is enforced via software safety gates: workspace bounds, speed and force caps,
timeouts, and bounded retries. We describe the architecture, knowledge design,
integration choices, and a reproducible evaluation protocol for tabletop scan,
approach, and pick-place tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy
of the proposed approach. Our design shows that RAG-based planning can
substantially improve plan validity and adaptability while keeping perception
and low-level control local to the robot.

TL;DR: GO-Flock是一个混合群体控制框架，结合了规划与反应式人工势场控制，解决了传统APF方法在障碍物环境中容易陷入局部最小值和死锁的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人工势场方法在群体控制中存在死锁和局部最小值问题，特别是在有障碍物的环境中。现有解决方案通常是被动的，导致群体导航缓慢低效，许多APF方法只能在无障碍环境或简化模拟中验证。

Method: GO-Flock包含上游感知模块（处理深度图提取路径点和虚拟代理用于避障）和下游群体导航模块（应用新型APF策略实现有效群体行为）。

Result: 在障碍物密集环境和硬件在环实验中成功验证，成功让9架无人机（6架物理、3架虚拟）在森林环境中实现群体飞行。

Conclusion: GO-Flock框架通过整合规划与反应式控制，有效解决了传统APF方法在复杂环境中的局限性，实现了高效群体导航。

Abstract: Artificial Potential Field (APF) methods are widely used for reactive
flocking control, but they often suffer from challenges such as deadlocks and
local minima, especially in the presence of obstacles. Existing solutions to
address these issues are typically passive, leading to slow and inefficient
collective navigation. As a result, many APF approaches have only been
validated in obstacle-free environments or simplified, pseudo 3D simulations.
This paper presents GO-Flock, a hybrid flocking framework that integrates
planning with reactive APF-based control. GO-Flock consists of an upstream
Perception Module, which processes depth maps to extract waypoints and virtual
agents for obstacle avoidance, and a downstream Collective Navigation Module,
which applies a novel APF strategy to achieve effective flocking behavior in
cluttered environments. We evaluate GO-Flock against passive APF-based
approaches to demonstrate their respective merits, such as their flocking
behavior and the ability to overcome local minima. Finally, we validate
GO-Flock through obstacle-filled environment and also hardware-in-the-loop
experiments where we successfully flocked a team of nine drones, six physical
and three virtual, in a forest environment.

<details>

Motivation: 现有透明物体操作研究局限于短时程任务和基本抓取能力，缺乏对新物体的泛化性和精确长时程操作能力。

Method: 提出DeLTa框架，结合深度估计、6D姿态估计和视觉语言规划，采用单次演示方法泛化6D轨迹到新透明物体，无需类别先验或额外训练。

Result: 在需要精确操作能力的长时程场景中，该方法显著优于现有透明物体操作方法。

Conclusion: DeLTa为透明物体的精确长时程操作提供了有效的解决方案，具有良好的泛化性和实用性。

Abstract: Despite the prevalence of transparent object interactions in human everyday
life, transparent robotic manipulation research remains limited to
short-horizon tasks and basic grasping capabilities.Although some methods have
partially addressed these issues, most of them have limitations in
generalizability to novel objects and are insufficient for precise long-horizon
robot manipulation. To address this limitation, we propose DeLTa (Demonstration
and Language-Guided Novel Transparent Object Manipulation), a novel framework
that integrates depth estimation, 6D pose estimation, and vision-language
planning for precise long-horizon manipulation of transparent objects guided by
natural task instructions. A key advantage of our method is its
single-demonstration approach, which generalizes 6D trajectories to novel
transparent objects without requiring category-level priors or additional
training. Additionally, we present a task planner that refines the
VLM-generated plan to account for the constraints of a single-arm, eye-in-hand
robot for long-horizon object manipulation tasks. Through comprehensive
evaluation, we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing
transparent object manipulation approaches, particularly in long-horizon
scenarios requiring precise manipulation capabilities. Project page:

TL;DR: 提出了MG-Select测试时扩展框架，通过利用VLA模型的内部属性，无需额外训练即可提高机器人控制精度。使用KL散度作为置信度指标，从多个候选动作中选择最优动作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Vision-Language-Action模型在需要高精度的任务中存在根本性限制，而基于外部验证器的测试时扩展方法需要额外训练且无法泛化到未见条件。

Method: 使用随机掩码状态和语言条件生成参考分布，通过KL散度选择最优动作。提出联合训练策略，通过dropout学习条件和非条件分布。

Result: 在真实世界分布内/外任务中分别提升28%/35%，在RoboCasa拾放任务中相对增益达168%（仅使用30个演示训练）。

Conclusion: MG-Select框架有效提高了VLA模型的精度和鲁棒性，无需额外训练或外部模块，在分布内外任务中均表现出显著改进。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have demonstrated remarkable performance
in robot control. However, they remain fundamentally limited in tasks that
require high precision due to their single-inference paradigm. While test-time
scaling approaches using external verifiers have shown promise, they require
additional training and fail to generalize to unseen conditions. We propose
Masking Distribution Guided Selection (MG-Select), a novel test-time scaling
framework for VLAs that leverages the model's internal properties without
requiring additional training or external modules. Our approach utilizes KL
divergence from a reference action token distribution as a confidence metric
for selecting the optimal action from multiple candidates. We introduce a
reference distribution generated by the same VLA but with randomly masked
states and language conditions as inputs, ensuring maximum uncertainty while
remaining aligned with the target task distribution. Additionally, we propose a
joint training strategy that enables the model to learn both conditional and
unconditional distributions by applying dropout to state and language
conditions, thereby further improving the quality of the reference
distribution. Our experiments demonstrate that MG-Select achieves significant
performance improvements, including a 28%/35% improvement in real-world
in-distribution/out-of-distribution tasks, along with a 168% relative gain on
RoboCasa pick-and-place tasks trained with 30 demonstrations.

TL;DR: OMC-RL是一个新颖的视觉运动策略学习框架，通过两阶段学习（上游表示学习和下游策略学习）来提高样本效率和渐近性能，使用掩码Transformer和对比学习提取时间感知表示，并通过特权教师策略提供早期指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统视觉运动策略学习中高维视觉输入与敏捷动作输出结合带来的样本效率低和仿真到真实差距大的长期挑战。

Method: 两阶段学习：上游使用掩码Transformer进行时间建模和对比学习提取视觉表示；下游使用特权教师策略提供早期指导并逐步减少。

Result: 在仿真和真实环境中的广泛实验表明，OMC-RL实现了优越的样本效率和渐近策略性能，同时提高了在多样化和感知复杂场景中的泛化能力。

Conclusion: OMC-RL框架通过解耦表示学习和策略学习，结合特权指导，有效解决了视觉运动策略学习中的关键挑战。

Abstract: A prevailing approach for learning visuomotor policies is to employ
reinforcement learning to map high-dimensional visual observations directly to
action commands. However, the combination of high-dimensional visual inputs and
agile maneuver outputs leads to long-standing challenges, including low sample
efficiency and significant sim-to-real gaps. To address these issues, we
propose Oracle-Guided Masked Contrastive Reinforcement Learning (OMC-RL), a
novel framework designed to improve the sample efficiency and asymptotic
performance of visuomotor policy learning. OMC-RL explicitly decouples the
learning process into two stages: an upstream representation learning stage and
a downstream policy learning stage. In the upstream stage, a masked Transformer
module is trained with temporal modeling and contrastive learning to extract
temporally-aware and task-relevant representations from sequential visual
inputs. After training, the learned encoder is frozen and used to extract
visual representations from consecutive frames, while the Transformer module is
discarded. In the downstream stage, an oracle teacher policy with privileged
access to global state information supervises the agent during early training
to provide informative guidance and accelerate early policy learning. This
guidance is gradually reduced to allow independent exploration as training
progresses. Extensive experiments in simulated and real-world environments
demonstrate that OMC-RL achieves superior sample efficiency and asymptotic
policy performance, while also improving generalization across diverse and
perceptually complex scenarios.

Conclusion: 该方法具有良好性能、可扩展性和实际应用价值，能够准确表示复杂轨迹同时尊重流形约束

Abstract: Learning stable dynamical systems from data is crucial for safe and reliable
robot motion planning and control. However, extending stability guarantees to
trajectories defined on Riemannian manifolds poses significant challenges due
to the manifold's geometric constraints. To address this, we propose a general
framework for learning stable dynamical systems on Riemannian manifolds using
neural ordinary differential equations. Our method guarantees stability by
projecting the neural vector field evolving on the manifold so that it strictly
satisfies the Lyapunov stability criterion, ensuring stability at every system
state. By leveraging a flexible neural parameterisation for both the base
vector field and the Lyapunov function, our framework can accurately represent
complex trajectories while respecting manifold constraints by evolving
solutions directly on the manifold. We provide an efficient training strategy
for applying our framework and demonstrate its utility by solving Riemannian
LASA datasets on the unit quaternion (S^3) and symmetric positive-definite
matrix manifolds, as well as robotic motions evolving on \mathbb{R}^3 \times
S^3. We demonstrate the performance, scalability, and practical applicability
of our approach through extensive simulations and by learning robot motions in
a real-world experiment.

Main category: cs.RO

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确定性碰撞检查在不确定驾驶条件下往往不准确或过于保守，因为噪声感知、定位误差和其他交通参与者的不确定预测给规划过程带来了显著不确定性。

Method: 第一种方法评估自动驾驶车辆与周围障碍物空间重叠的概率，第二种方法基于随机边界穿越估计碰撞概率。两种方法都包含了完整状态不确定性（位置、方向和速度）。

Result: 仿真研究表明，所提方法在计算成本适合实时规划的同时，与蒙特卡洛结果高度匹配，并提供了显著的运行时优势。

Conclusion: 这些碰撞估计方法可用于风险感知轨迹规划，并已作为开源软件发布。

Abstract: This research introduces two efficient methods to estimate the collision risk
of planned trajectories in autonomous driving under uncertain driving
conditions. Deterministic collision checks of planned trajectories are often
inaccurate or overly conservative, as noisy perception, localization errors,
and uncertain predictions of other traffic participants introduce significant
uncertainty into the planning process. This paper presents two semi-analytic
methods to compute the collision probability of planned trajectories with
arbitrary convex obstacles. The first approach evaluates the probability of
spatial overlap between an autonomous vehicle and surrounding obstacles, while
the second estimates the collision probability based on stochastic boundary
crossings. Both formulations incorporate full state uncertainties, including
position, orientation, and velocity, and achieve high accuracy at computational
costs suitable for real-time planning. Simulation studies verify that the
proposed methods closely match Monte Carlo results while providing significant
runtime advantages, enabling their use in risk-aware trajectory planning. The
collision estimation methods are available as open-source software:

Motivation: 由于步行模式存在显著的人际和个体内变异性，需要设计能够适应每个个体独特特征的机器人控制器，以提供个性化的步态训练辅助。

Method: 采用协方差矩阵自适应进化策略(CMA-ES)持续优化下肢外骨骼的按需辅助控制器，在为期两天的实验中涉及六名健康个体。

Result: CMA-ES算法似乎能为每个个体收敛到一组独特的刚度参数，但在验证试验中未观察到对受试者表现的显著影响。

Conclusion: 研究结果突显了人机协同适应和人类行为变异性的影响，其效果可能超过个性化基于规则的辅助控制器的潜在益处，这有助于理解当前个性化方法在外骨骼辅助步态康复中的局限性。

Abstract: Wearable robots offer a promising solution for quantitatively monitoring gait
and providing systematic, adaptive assistance to promote patient independence
and improve gait. However, due to significant interpersonal and intrapersonal
variability in walking patterns, it is important to design robot controllers
that can adapt to the unique characteristics of each individual. This paper
investigates the potential of human-in-the-loop optimisation (HILO) to deliver
personalised assistance in gait training. The Covariance Matrix Adaptation
Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) was employed to continuously optimise an
assist-as-needed controller of a lower-limb exoskeleton. Six healthy
individuals participated over a two-day experiment. Our results suggest that
while the CMA-ES appears to converge to a unique set of stiffnesses for each
individual, no measurable impact on the subjects' performance was observed
during the validation trials. These findings highlight the impact of
human-robot co-adaptation and human behaviour variability, whose effect may be
greater than potential benefits of personalising rule-based assistive
controllers. Our work contributes to understanding the limitations of current
personalisation approaches in exoskeleton-assisted gait rehabilitation and
identifies key challenges for effective implementation of human-in-the-loop
optimisation in this domain.

Abstract: Robotic grasping is one of the most fundamental tasks in robotic
manipulation, and grasp detection/generation has long been the subject of
extensive research. Recently, language-driven grasp generation has emerged as a
promising direction due to its practical interaction capabilities. However,
most existing approaches either lack sufficient reasoning and generalization
capabilities or depend on complex modular pipelines. Moreover, current grasp
foundation models tend to overemphasize dialog and object semantics, resulting
in inferior performance and restriction to single-object grasping. To maintain
strong reasoning ability and generalization in cluttered environments, we
propose VCoT-Grasp, an end-to-end grasp foundation model that incorporates
visual chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance visual understanding for grasp
generation. VCoT-Grasp adopts a multi-turn processing paradigm that dynamically
focuses on visual inputs while providing interpretable reasoning traces. For
training, we refine and introduce a large-scale dataset, VCoT-GraspSet,
comprising 167K synthetic images with over 1.36M grasps, as well as 400+
real-world images with more than 1.2K grasps, annotated with intermediate
bounding boxes. Extensive experiments on both VCoT-GraspSet and real robot
demonstrate that our method significantly improves grasp success rates and
generalizes effectively to unseen objects, backgrounds, and distractors. More

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有协同设计框架通常只优化最大高度或最小能耗，忽略了二者之间的权衡关系，且常省略变速箱参数优化并使用过度简化的执行器质量模型，导致设计难以实际复制。

Method: 三阶段协同设计优化框架，联合优化机械设计（包括变速箱）和控制参数，采用真实执行器质量模型，并自动生成参数化CAD模型用于直接制造。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了跳跃高度与能耗的权衡问题，通过集成真实模型和自动化设计流程，显著减少了手动设计迭代，产生了可直接制造的设计方案。

Abstract: A monoped's jump height and energy consumption depend on both, its mechanical
design and control strategy. Existing co-design frameworks typically optimize
for either maximum height or minimum energy, neglecting their trade-off. They
also often omit gearbox parameter optimization and use oversimplified actuator
mass models, producing designs difficult to replicate in practice. In this
work, we introduce a novel three-stage co-design optimization framework that
jointly maximizes jump height while minimizing mechanical energy consumption of
a monoped. The proposed method explicitly incorporates realistic actuator mass
models and optimizes mechanical design (including gearbox) and control
parameters within a unified framework. The resulting design outputs are then
used to automatically generate a parameterized CAD model suitable for direct
fabrication, significantly reducing manual design iterations. Our experimental
evaluations demonstrate a 50 percent reduction in mechanical energy consumption
compared to the baseline design, while achieving a jump height of 0.8m. Video

Conclusion: 该方法展示了潜在动力学模型强化学习在实现仅基于噪声传感器反馈的软体机器人自适应运动方面的潜力。

Abstract: Soft robotic crawlers are mobile robots that utilize soft body deformability
and compliance to achieve locomotion through surface contact. Designing control
strategies for such systems is challenging due to model inaccuracies, sensor
noise, and the need to discover locomotor gaits. In this work, we present a
model-based reinforcement learning (MB-RL) framework in which latent dynamics
inferred from onboard sensors serve as a predictive model that guides an
actor-critic algorithm to optimize locomotor policies. We evaluate the
framework on a minimal crawler model in simulation using inertial measurement
units and time-of-flight sensors as observations. The learned latent dynamics
enable short-horizon motion prediction while the actor-critic discovers
effective locomotor policies. This approach highlights the potential of
latent-dynamics MB-RL for enabling embodied soft robotic adaptive locomotion
based solely on noisy sensor feedback.

Abstract: Planetary exploration missions require robust locomotion systems capable of
operating in extreme environments over extended periods. This paper presents
the DISTANT (Distant Transmission and Steering Systems) design, a novel
approach for relocating rover traction and steering actuators from
wheel-mounted positions to a thermally protected warm box within the rover
body. The design addresses critical challenges in long-distance traversal
missions by protecting sensitive components from thermal cycling, dust
contamination, and mechanical wear. A double wishbone suspension configuration
with cardan joints and capstan drive steering has been selected as the optimal
architecture following comprehensive trade-off analysis. The system enables
independent wheel traction, steering control, and suspension management whilst
maintaining all motorisation within the protected environment. The design meets
a 50 km traverse requirement without performance degradation, with integrated
dust protection mechanisms and thermal management solutions. Testing and
validation activities are planned for Q1 2026 following breadboard
manufacturing at 1:3 scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SLAM方法每次运行的坐标原点会重置，而基于固定锚点的UWB定位能保持跨会话的坐标一致性，但需要准确分配锚点坐标。

Method: 两阶段方法：第一阶段使用连续时间批量优化，结合距离和里程计数据恢复锚点3D位置；第二阶段使用滑动窗口优化方案融合UWB和SLAM数据。

Result: 在NTU VIRAL数据集上的UAV飞行实验表明，使用一次运行数据进行校准就足以在其余运行中实现精确定位。

Conclusion: 该方法能够实现坐标一致的精确定位，并发布了源代码以惠及社区。

Abstract: Onboard simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) methods are commonly
used to provide accurate localization information for autonomous robots.
However, the coordinate origin of SLAM estimate often resets for each run. On
the other hand, UWB-based localization with fixed anchors can ensure a
consistent coordinate reference across sessions; however, it requires an
accurate assignment of the anchor nodes' coordinates. To this end, we propose a
two-stage approach that calibrates and fuses UWB data and SLAM data to achieve
coordinate-wise consistent and accurate localization in the same environment.
In the first stage, we solve a continuous-time batch optimization problem by
using the range and odometry data from one full run, incorporating height
priors and anchor-to-anchor distance factors to recover the anchors' 3D
positions. For the subsequent runs in the second stage, a sliding-window
optimization scheme fuses the UWB and SLAM data, which facilitates accurate
localization in the same coordinate system. Experiments are carried out on the
NTU VIRAL dataset with six scenarios of UAV flight, and we show that
calibration using data in one run is sufficient to enable accurate localization
in the remaining runs. We release our source code to benefit the community at
https://github.com/ntdathp/slam-uwb-calibration.

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效实现跨具身形态的灵巧抓握生成，具有高成功率和快速推理能力，并通过少样本适应展示了良好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Dexterous grasping with multi-fingered hands remains challenging due to
high-dimensional articulations and the cost of optimization-based pipelines.
Existing end-to-end methods require training on large-scale datasets for
specific hands, limiting their ability to generalize across different
embodiments. We propose an eigengrasp-based, end-to-end framework for
cross-embodiment grasp generation. From a hand's morphology description, we
derive a morphology embedding and an eigengrasp set. Conditioned on these,
together with the object point cloud and wrist pose, an amplitude predictor
regresses articulation coefficients in a low-dimensional space, which are
decoded into full joint articulations. Articulation learning is supervised with
a Kinematic-Aware Articulation Loss (KAL) that emphasizes fingertip-relevant
motions and injects morphology-specific structure. In simulation on unseen
objects across three dexterous hands, our model attains a 91.9% average grasp
success rate with less than 0.4 seconds inference per grasp. With few-shot
adaptation to an unseen hand, it achieves 85.6% success on unseen objects in
simulation, and real-world experiments on this few-shot generalized hand
achieve an 87% success rate. The code and additional materials will be made
available upon publication on our project website

Abstract: This project proposes a bioinspired multi-robot system using Distributed
Optimization for efficient exploration and mapping of unknown environments.
Each robot explores its environment and creates a map, which is afterwards put
together to form a global 2D map of the environment. Inspired by wall-following
behaviors, each robot autonomously explores its neighborhood based on a tactile
sensor, similar to the antenna of a cockroach, mounted on the surface of the
robot. Instead of avoiding obstacles, robots log collision points when they
touch obstacles. This decentralized control strategy ensures effective task
allocation and efficient exploration of unknown terrains, with applications in
search and rescue, industrial inspection, and environmental monitoring. The
approach was validated through experiments using e-puck robots in a simulated
1.5 x 1.5 m environment with three obstacles. The results demonstrated the
system's effectiveness in achieving high coverage, minimizing collisions, and
constructing accurate 2D maps.

Abstract: Chronic wounds, such as diabetic, pressure, and venous ulcers, affect over
6.5 million patients in the United States alone and generate an annual cost
exceeding \$25 billion. Despite this burden, chronic wound care remains a
routine yet manual process performed exclusively by trained clinicians due to
its critical safety demands. We envision a future in which robotics and
automation support wound care to lower costs and enhance patient outcomes. This
paper introduces an autonomous framework for one of the most fundamental yet
challenging subtasks in wound redressing: adhesive tape manipulation.
Specifically, we address two critical capabilities: tape initial detachment
(TID) and secure tape placement. To handle the complex adhesive dynamics of
detachment, we propose a force-feedback imitation learning approach trained
from human teleoperation demonstrations. For tape placement, we develop a
numerical trajectory optimization method based to ensure smooth adhesion and
wrinkle-free application across diverse anatomical surfaces. We validate these
methods through extensive experiments, demonstrating reliable performance in
both quantitative evaluations and integrated wound redressing pipelines. Our
results establish tape manipulation as an essential step toward practical
robotic wound care automation.

Abstract: Robotic pollination offers a promising alternative to manual labor and
bumblebee-assisted methods in controlled agriculture, where wind-driven
pollination is absent and regulatory restrictions limit the use of commercial
pollinators. In this work, we present and validate a vision-guided robotic
framework that uses data from an end-effector mounted RGB-D sensor and combines
3D plant reconstruction, targeted grasp planning, and physics-based vibration
modeling to enable precise pollination. First, the plant is reconstructed in 3D
and registered to the robot coordinate frame to identify obstacle-free grasp
poses along the main stem. Second, a discrete elastic rod model predicts the
relationship between actuation parameters and flower dynamics, guiding the
selection of optimal pollination strategies. Finally, a manipulator with soft
grippers grasps the stem and applies controlled vibrations to induce pollen
release. End-to-end experiments demonstrate a 92.5\% main-stem grasping success
rate, and simulation-guided optimization of vibration parameters further
validates the feasibility of our approach, ensuring that the robot can safely
and effectively perform pollination without damaging the flower. To our
knowledge, this is the first robotic system to jointly integrate vision-based
grasping and vibration modeling for automated precision pollination.

Abstract: Hair care is an essential daily activity, yet it remains inaccessible to
individuals with limited mobility and challenging for autonomous robot systems
due to the fine-grained physical structure and complex dynamics of hair. In
this work, we present DYMO-Hair, a model-based robot hair care system. We
introduce a novel dynamics learning paradigm that is suited for volumetric
quantities such as hair, relying on an action-conditioned latent state editing
mechanism, coupled with a compact 3D latent space of diverse hairstyles to
improve generalizability. This latent space is pre-trained at scale using a
novel hair physics simulator, enabling generalization across previously unseen
hairstyles. Using the dynamics model with a Model Predictive Path Integral
(MPPI) planner, DYMO-Hair is able to perform visual goal-conditioned hair
styling. Experiments in simulation demonstrate that DYMO-Hair's dynamics model
outperforms baselines on capturing local deformation for diverse, unseen
hairstyles. DYMO-Hair further outperforms baselines in closed-loop hair styling
tasks on unseen hairstyles, with an average of 22% lower final geometric error
and 42% higher success rate than the state-of-the-art system. Real-world
experiments exhibit zero-shot transferability of our system to wigs, achieving
consistent success on challenging unseen hairstyles where the state-of-the-art
system fails. Together, these results introduce a foundation for model-based
robot hair care, advancing toward more generalizable, flexible, and accessible
robot hair styling in unconstrained physical environments. More details are

Abstract: Recent advances in control robot methods, from end-to-end
vision-language-action frameworks to modular systems with predefined
primitives, have advanced robots' ability to follow natural language
instructions. Nonetheless, many approaches still struggle to scale to diverse
environments, as they often rely on large annotated datasets and offer limited
interpretability.In this work, we introduce EmbodiedCoder, a training-free
framework for open-world mobile robot manipulation that leverages coding models
to directly generate executable robot trajectories. By grounding high-level
instructions in code, EmbodiedCoder enables flexible object geometry
parameterization and manipulation trajectory synthesis without additional data
collection or fine-tuning.This coding-based paradigm provides a transparent and
generalizable way to connect perception with manipulation. Experiments on real
mobile robots show that EmbodiedCoder achieves robust performance across
diverse long-term tasks and generalizes effectively to novel objects and
environments.Our results demonstrate an interpretable approach for bridging
high-level reasoning and low-level control, moving beyond fixed primitives
toward versatile robot intelligence. See the project page at:

Abstract: In this paper, we present a biologically grounded approach to reservoir
computing (RC), in which a network of cultured biological neurons serves as the
reservoir substrate. This system, referred to as biological reservoir computing
(BRC), replaces artificial recurrent units with the spontaneous and evoked
activity of living neurons. A multi-electrode array (MEA) enables simultaneous
stimulation and readout across multiple sites: inputs are delivered through a
subset of electrodes, while the remaining ones capture the resulting neural
responses, mapping input patterns into a high-dimensional biological feature
space. We evaluate the system through a case study on digit classification
using a custom dataset. Input images are encoded and delivered to the
biological reservoir via electrical stimulation, and the corresponding neural
activity is used to train a simple linear classifier. To contextualize the
performance of the biological system, we also include a comparison with a
standard artificial reservoir trained on the same task. The results indicate
that the biological reservoir can effectively support classification,
highlighting its potential as a viable and interpretable computational
substrate. We believe this work contributes to the broader effort of
integrating biological principles into machine learning and aligns with the
goals of human-inspired vision by exploring how living neural systems can
inform the design of efficient and biologically plausible models.

Conclusion: 所提方法在可解释性、公平性和效率方面优于DBSCAN和凝聚聚类等基线方法，实现了4%的轮廓系数提升和高达1%的熵减少，证明了其在大数据环境中的有效性。

Abstract: The growing complexity of machine learning (ML) models in big data analytics,
especially in domains such as environmental monitoring, highlights the critical
need for interpretability and explainability to promote trust, ethical
considerations, and regulatory adherence (e.g., GDPR). Traditional "black-box"
models obstruct transparency, whereas post-hoc explainable AI (XAI) techniques
like LIME and SHAP frequently compromise accuracy or fail to deliver inherent
insights. This paper presents a novel framework that combines type-2 fuzzy
sets, granular computing, and clustering to boost explainability and fairness
in big data environments. When applied to the UCI Air Quality dataset, the
framework effectively manages uncertainty in noisy sensor data, produces
linguistic rules, and assesses fairness using silhouette scores and entropy.
Key contributions encompass: (1) A type-2 fuzzy clustering approach that
enhances cohesion by about 4% compared to type-1 methods (silhouette 0.365 vs.
0.349) and improves fairness (entropy 0.918); (2) Incorporation of fairness
measures to mitigate biases in unsupervised scenarios; (3) A rule-based
component for intrinsic XAI, achieving an average coverage of 0.65; (4)
Scalable assessments showing linear runtime (roughly 0.005 seconds for sampled
big data sizes). Experimental outcomes reveal superior performance relative to
baselines such as DBSCAN and Agglomerative Clustering in terms of
interpretability, fairness, and efficiency. Notably, the proposed method
achieves a 4% improvement in silhouette score over type-1 fuzzy clustering and
outperforms baselines in fairness (entropy reduction by up to 1%) and
efficiency.

Abstract: Transformer models have become increasingly popular in financial

The purpose of this work is to audit the reliance of the model on volatile data

prediction, and introduce a metric based on Partial Information Decomposition
(PID) to measure the influence of each asset on the model's decision making.

price movements.

Abstract: This paper presents a controlled study of adversarial reinforcement learning
in network security through a custom OpenAI Gym environment that models
brute-force attacks and reactive defenses on multi-port services. The
environment captures realistic security trade-offs including background traffic
noise, progressive exploitation mechanics, IP-based evasion tactics, honeypot
traps, and multi-level rate-limiting defenses. Competing attacker and defender
agents are trained using Deep Q-Networks (DQN) within a zero-sum reward
framework, where successful exploits yield large terminal rewards while
incremental actions incur small costs. Through systematic evaluation across
multiple configurations (varying trap detection probabilities, exploitation
difficulty thresholds, and training regimens), the results demonstrate that
defender observability and trap effectiveness create substantial barriers to
successful attacks. The experiments reveal that reward shaping and careful
training scheduling are critical for learning stability in this adversarial
setting. The defender consistently maintains strategic advantage across 50,000+
training episodes, with performance gains amplifying when exposed to complex
defensive strategies including adaptive IP blocking and port-specific controls.
Complete implementation details, reproducible hyperparameter configurations,
and architectural guidelines are provided to support future research in
adversarial RL for cybersecurity. The zero-sum formulation and realistic
operational constraints make this environment suitable for studying autonomous
defense systems, attacker-defender co-evolution, and transfer learning to
real-world network security scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于代理的优化(SBO)方法只能收敛到单点解，限制了设计空间探索并忽略了有价值的替代拓扑结构，需要一种能够生成多样化高性能设计组合的新方法。

Method: 基于条件变分自编码器(CVAE)的框架，学习系统设计参数与性能之间的概率映射，能够根据特定性能目标生成多样化的高性能候选设计组合。

Result: CVAE框架成功生成了256个新颖设计，有效率为94.1%。其中77.2%的有效设计在性能上优于SBO基准方法找到的单一最优设计。

Conclusion: 生成式方法不仅发现了更高质量的解决方案，还提供了丰富的多样化候选组合，通过支持多标准决策从根本上增强了工程设计过程。

Abstract: Inverse design, which seeks to find optimal parameters for a target output,
is a central challenge in engineering. Surrogate-based optimization (SBO) has
become a standard approach, yet it is fundamentally structured to converge to a
single-point solution, thereby limiting design space exploration and ignoring
potentially valuable alternative topologies. This paper presents a paradigm
shift from single-point optimization to generative inverse design. We introduce
a framework based on a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) that learns a
probabilistic mapping between a system's design parameters and its performance,
enabling the generation of a diverse portfolio of high-performing candidates
conditioned on a specific performance objective. We apply this methodology to
the complex, non-linear problem of minimizing airfoil self-noise, using a
high-performing SBO method from a prior benchmark study as a rigorous baseline.
The CVAE framework successfully generated 256 novel designs with a 94.1\%
validity rate. A subsequent surrogate-based evaluation revealed that 77.2\% of
these valid designs achieved superior performance compared to the single
optimal design found by the SBO baseline. This work demonstrates that the
generative approach not only discovers higher-quality solutions but also
provides a rich portfolio of diverse candidates, fundamentally enhancing the
engineering design process by enabling multi-criteria decision-making.

### [215] [Improved High-probability Convergence Guarantees of Decentralized SGD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06141)
*Aleksandar Armacki,Ali H. Sayed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文重新审视了去中心化随机梯度下降(DSGD)在高概率(HP)意义下的收敛性，证明了DSGD在成本函数条件与均方误差(MSE)收敛相同的情况下也能实现HP收敛，消除了均匀有界梯度等限制性假设，并实现了非凸和强凸成本的最优收敛速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去中心化设置中的高概率收敛研究需要强假设条件(如均匀有界梯度或渐近消失噪声)，导致HP收敛与MSE收敛的假设条件存在显著差距，这与集中式设置中SGD在相同条件下实现HP收敛的情况相反。

Method: 通过仔细分析感兴趣量(梯度范数平方或最优性间隙)的矩生成函数(MGF)和用户模型间共识间隙的MGF，提供了去中心化方法在HP意义下的方差缩减效应的新结果，并对强凸成本给出了更精细的MGF边界。

Result: DSGD在HP意义下收敛，且与MSE收敛具有相同的成本函数条件，同时实现了非凸和强凸成本的最优收敛速率，并在用户数量上实现了线性加速。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了去中心化设置中HP收敛与MSE收敛之间的假设差距，证明了DSGD在HP意义上保持强性能，并与现有MSE保证相匹配，为去中心化优化提供了更全面的理论保证。

Abstract: Convergence in high-probability (HP) has been receiving increasing interest,
due to its attractive properties, such as exponentially decaying tail bounds
and strong guarantees for each individual run of an algorithm. While HP
guarantees are extensively studied in centralized settings, much less is
understood in the decentralized, networked setup. Existing HP studies in
decentralized settings impose strong assumptions, like uniformly bounded
gradients, or asymptotically vanishing noise, resulting in a significant gap
between assumptions used to establish convergence in the HP and the
mean-squared error (MSE) sense, even for vanilla Decentralized Stochastic
Gradient Descent ($\mathtt{DSGD}$) algorithm. This is contrary to centralized
settings, where it is known that $\mathtt{SGD}$ converges in HP under the same
conditions on the cost function as needed to guarantee MSE convergence.
Motivated by this observation, we revisit HP guarantees for $\mathtt{DSGD}$ in
the presence of light-tailed noise. We show that $\mathtt{DSGD}$ converges in
HP under the same conditions on the cost as in the MSE sense, removing
uniformly bounded gradients and other restrictive assumptions, while
simultaneously achieving order-optimal rates for both non-convex and strongly
convex costs. Moreover, our improved analysis yields linear speed-up in the
number of users, demonstrating that $\mathtt{DSGD}$ maintains strong
performance in the HP sense and matches existing MSE guarantees. Our improved
results stem from a careful analysis of the MGF of quantities of interest
(norm-squared of gradient or optimality gap) and the MGF of the consensus gap
between users' models. To achieve linear speed-up, we provide a novel result on
the variance-reduction effect of decentralized methods in the HP sense and more
fine-grained bounds on the MGF for strongly convex costs, which are both of
independent interest.

Abstract: This systematic literature review examines the role of machine learning in
fraud detection within digital banking, synthesizing evidence from 118
peer-reviewed studies and institutional reports. Following the PRISMA
guidelines, the review applied a structured identification, screening,
eligibility, and inclusion process to ensure methodological rigor and
transparency. The findings reveal that supervised learning methods, such as
decision trees, logistic regression, and support vector machines, remain the
dominant paradigm due to their interpretability and established performance,
while unsupervised anomaly detection approaches are increasingly adopted to
address novel fraud patterns in highly imbalanced datasets. Deep learning
architectures, particularly recurrent and convolutional neural networks, have
emerged as transformative tools capable of modeling sequential transaction data
and detecting complex fraud typologies, though challenges of interpretability
and real-time deployment persist. Hybrid models that combine supervised,
unsupervised, and deep learning strategies demonstrate superior adaptability
and detection accuracy, highlighting their potential as convergent solutions.

*Eric Jahns,Davi Moreno,Milan Stojkov,Michel A. Kinsy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个针对高性能深度脉冲神经网络设计的QIF神经元离散化方法，通过分析其动力学特性并推导出基于参数集的代理梯度窗口，解决了训练稳定性问题，在多个数据集上超越了基于LIF的现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LIF神经元虽然计算效率高但表达能力有限，而QIF等复杂神经元模型具有更丰富的非线性动力学特性，但由于训练不稳定而应用受限。

Method: 提出了QIF神经元模型的离散化方法，从离散化参数集中推导出代理梯度窗口的解析公式，以最小化梯度失配，确保训练稳定性。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、ImageNet和CIFAR-10 DVS等数据集上的评估表明，该方法能够超越基于LIF的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的QIF神经元离散化方法结合了丰富的动力学特性和实际可扩展性，成为深度SNN中LIF神经元的有力替代方案。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as energy-efficient alternatives
to traditional artificial neural networks, leveraging asynchronous and
biologically inspired neuron dynamics. Among existing neuron models, the Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron has become widely adopted in deep SNNs due to
its simplicity and computational efficiency. However, this efficiency comes at
the expense of expressiveness, as LIF dynamics are constrained to linear decay
at each timestep. In contrast, more complex models, such as the Quadratic
Integrate-and-Fire (QIF) neuron, exhibit richer, nonlinear dynamics but have
seen limited adoption due to their training instability. On that note, we
propose the first discretization of the QIF neuron model tailored for
high-performance deep spiking neural networks and provide an in-depth analysis
of its dynamics. To ensure training stability, we derive an analytical
formulation for surrogate gradient windows directly from our discretizations'
parameter set, minimizing gradient mismatch. We evaluate our method on
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and CIFAR-10 DVS, demonstrating its ability to
outperform state-of-the-art LIF-based methods. These results establish our
discretization of the QIF neuron as a compelling alternative to LIF neurons for
deep SNNs, combining richer dynamics with practical scalability.

*Haijin Xie,Gongquan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出MADCN框架预测城市碳排放，结合多头注意力和深度交叉网络，使用SHAP解释特征贡献。在275个中国城市数据上验证，显示人口、城市规模、GDP等是主要影响因素，新质生产力、数字经济和AI技术也有显著减排作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新质生产力、数字经济和人工智能技术对促进可持续城市发展日益重要，需要有效预测碳排放并分析技术因素的影响。

Method: 提出多头注意力深度交叉网络(MADCN)框架，结合特征交互建模和注意力机制，使用SHAP进行可解释性分析，基于275个中国城市的面板数据进行验证。

Result: MADCN模型在测试集上取得MSE=406,151.063、MAE=612.304、R²=0.991的优异预测性能。SHAP分析显示人口、城市规模、城镇化率和GDP是最主要影响因素，新质生产力、数字经济和AI技术也有适度影响。

Conclusion: 推进新质生产力、加强数字经济和加速AI技术发展能显著减少城市碳排放。政策制定者应将技术创新整合到碳减排策略中，特别是推广智能基础设施和提升各行业数字化水平。

Abstract: New quality productive forces (NQPF), digital economy advancement, and
artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are becoming crucial for promoting
sustainable urban development. This study proposes a Multi-head Attention Deep
& Cross Network (MADCN) framework, combining feature interaction modeling and
attention mechanisms, to predict urban carbon emissions and investigate the
impacts of technological factors. The framework incorporates an interpretable
learning phase using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to assess the
contributions of different features. A panel dataset covering 275 Chinese
cities is utilized to test the MADCN model. Experimental results demonstrate
that the MADCN model achieves superior predictive performance compared to
traditional machine learning and deep learning baselines, with a Mean Squared
Error (MSE) of 406,151.063, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 612.304, and an
R-squared value of 0.991 on the test set. SHAP analysis highlights that
population, city size, urbanization rate, and GDP are among the most
influential factors on carbon emissions, while NQPF, digital economy index, and
AI technology level also show meaningful but relatively moderate effects.
Advancing NQPF, strengthening the digital economy, and accelerating AI
technology development can significantly contribute to reducing urban carbon
emissions. Policymakers should prioritize integrating technological innovation
into carbon reduction strategies, particularly by promoting intelligent
infrastructure and enhancing digitalization across sectors, to effectively
achieve dual-carbon goals.

TL;DR: 提出首个基于自监督预训练的电池容量估计模型，使用隐私友好的充电数据片段，通过片段相似性加权掩码输入重建学习通用表示，在领域偏移场景下比最佳基准方法降低31.9%测试误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决电动汽车电池容量估计中面临的实际数据限制问题，包括隐私法规约束和标记数据短缺，开发能够应对现实世界数据分布偏移的通用容量估计模型。

Method: 基于自监督预训练框架，使用片段相似性加权掩码输入重建方法，结合对比学习捕获片段间高层相似性，学习细粒度充电模式和高层关联关系的丰富表示。

Result: 在包含制造商和老化引起的分布偏移的挑战性领域偏移设置下，模型始终优于最先进的基线方法，测试误差比最佳基准降低31.9%。

Conclusion: 提出的自监督预训练框架能够从隐私友好、特征较少且碎片化的数据中学习丰富的通用表示，为电池容量估计提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate battery capacity estimation is key to alleviating consumer concerns
about battery performance and reliability of electric vehicles (EVs). However,
practical data limitations imposed by stringent privacy regulations and labeled
data shortages hamper the development of generalizable capacity estimation
models that remain robust to real-world data distribution shifts. While
self-supervised learning can leverage unlabeled data, existing techniques are
not particularly designed to learn effectively from challenging field data --
let alone from privacy-friendly data, which are often less feature-rich and
noisier. In this work, we propose a first-of-its-kind capacity estimation model
based on self-supervised pre-training, developed on a large-scale dataset of
privacy-friendly charging data snippets from real-world EV operations. Our
pre-training framework, snippet similarity-weighted masked input
reconstruction, is designed to learn rich, generalizable representations even
from less feature-rich and fragmented privacy-friendly data. Our key innovation
lies in harnessing contrastive learning to first capture high-level
similarities among fragmented snippets that otherwise lack meaningful context.
With our snippet-wise contrastive learning and subsequent similarity-weighted
masked reconstruction, we are able to learn rich representations of both
granular charging patterns within individual snippets and high-level
associative relationships across different snippets. Bolstered by this rich
representation learning, our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, achieving 31.9% lower test error than the best-performing benchmark,
even under challenging domain-shifted settings affected by both manufacturer
and age-induced distribution shifts.

TL;DR: 提出Fast Causal Attention (FCA)算法，通过减少10%的计算操作来精确计算因果注意力，加速GPU上的因果注意力前向和反向传播。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因果注意力计算中存在大量上三角或下三角矩阵乘法操作，这些操作在GPU上的默认实现效率不高，需要专门的优化方法。

Method: 基于机器学习和组合搜索发现的代数恒等式，针对因果注意力中的特殊矩阵乘法（其中一个操作数或输出矩阵是上三角或下三角矩阵）进行优化。

Result: 在GPU上，FCA相比默认PyTorch实现和Triton编译内核实现了显著加速，减少了10%的计算操作。

Conclusion: FCA通过代数优化成功加速了因果注意力计算，为Transformer模型的高效实现提供了新的优化途径。

Abstract: We present Fast Causal Attention (FCA), an algorithm that computes exact
Causal Attention using 10\% fewer operations. FCA accelerates a special class
of matrix multiplications where either one operand or the output matrix is
upper- or lower-triangular. This includes all operations in forward and
backward pass of Causal Attention, such as masked product
$\mathrm{Mask}(QK^{T})$. For these matrix multiplications on GPU, FCA reaches
noticeable accelerations over the default PyTorch implementations and Triton
compiled kernels. FCA is built upon algebraic identities discovered via machine
learning and combinatorial search.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PatternKV是一种针对LLM KV缓存的模式对齐残差量化方案，通过挖掘代表性模式向量、对齐KV向量并量化残差，有效降低KV缓存的内存和带宽瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存已成为LLM推理中的主要内存和带宽瓶颈，特别是在长上下文和测试时扩展场景下。现有量化方法因KV分布缺乏平坦性而精度下降严重。

Method: 提出PatternKV方案：在线挖掘代表性模式向量，将每个KV向量对齐到最近模式，仅量化残差部分，从而重塑KV分布、缩小量化范围。

Result: 在多个骨干模型的长上下文和测试时扩展设置中，PatternKV实现一致的2位增益，4位量化相对FP16仅下降0.08%，测试时扩展精度平均提升10%，吞吐量提升1.4倍，支持1.25倍更大批次。

Conclusion: PatternKV通过模式对齐残差量化有效解决了KV缓存量化难题，在保持精度的同时显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: KV cache in autoregressive LLMs eliminates redundant recomputation but has
emerged as the dominant memory and bandwidth bottleneck during inference,
notably with long contexts and test-time scaling. KV quantization is a key
lever for reducing cache cost, but accuracy drops sharply as the native KV
distribution lacks flatness and thus maintains a wide quantization range. Prior
work focuses on isolating outliers, which caps their error but fails to flatten
the overall distribution, leaving performance fragile under low-bit settings.
In this work, we show that the K cache maintains a stable structure that
evolves gradually with context, while the V cache carries latent semantic
regularities. Building on these insights, we propose PatternKV, a
pattern-aligned residual quantization scheme. It mines representative pattern
vectors online, aligns each KV vector to its nearest pattern, and quantizes
only the residual. This reshaping of the KV distribution flattens the
quantization target and narrows its range, thereby improving the fidelity of
low-bit KV quantization. Across long-context and test-time scaling settings on
multiple backbones, PatternKV delivers consistent 2-bit gains, with a 0.08%
average 4-bit drop relative to FP16, improves test-time scaling accuracy by 10%
on average, and raises throughput by 1.4x while supporting 1.25x larger
batches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出逻辑门控算子(LGO)，在符号回归中嵌入可学习的阈值和条件逻辑，生成具有明确单位感知阈值的紧凑符号方程，在医疗数据上验证了临床合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 符号回归虽然能生成可读方程，但难以编码单位感知的阈值和条件逻辑，限制了在需要明确阈值和条件判断的领域(如医疗)的应用。

Method: 提出逻辑门控算子(LGO)作为类型化原语，包含可学习的位置和陡度参数，通过硬门控变体实现紧凑的阈值条件，并映射回物理单位进行审计。

Result: 在两个医疗数据集(ICU、NHANES)上，硬门控变体恢复了临床合理的切点：71%的评估阈值在指南锚点的10%范围内，100%在20%范围内，且使用更少的门控(ICU中位数4.0 vs 10.0；NHANES 5.0 vs 12.5)，同时保持与强基线相当的准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法将可解释性从后验解释转变为建模约束，为符号回归提供了实用的机制切换计算能力，适合治理就绪的部署。

Abstract: Symbolic regression promises readable equations but struggles to encode
unit-aware thresholds and conditional logic. We propose logistic-gated
operators (LGO) -- differentiable gates with learnable location and steepness
-- embedded as typed primitives and mapped back to physical units for audit.
Across two primary health datasets (ICU, NHANES), the hard-gate variant
recovers clinically plausible cut-points: 71% (5/7) of assessed thresholds fall
within 10% of guideline anchors and 100% within 20%, while using far fewer
gates than the soft variant (ICU median 4.0 vs 10.0; NHANES 5.0 vs 12.5), and
remaining within the competitive accuracy envelope of strong SR baselines. On
predominantly smooth tasks, gates are pruned, preserving parsimony. The result
is compact symbolic equations with explicit, unit-aware thresholds that can be
audited against clinical anchors -- turning interpretability from a post-hoc
explanation into a modeling constraint and equipping symbolic regression with a
practical calculus for regime switching and governance-ready deployment.

Motivation: 在物联网环境中，传统机器学习入侵检测系统需要大量数据但面临隐私问题，联邦学习虽然能保护隐私但仍存在数据异构性和高能耗等挑战。

Method: 提出OptiFLIDS方法，在本地训练时应用剪枝技术减少模型复杂度，并设计定制化聚合方法处理因非IID数据导致的剪枝模型差异。

Conclusion: OptiFLIDS适合在真实物联网环境中部署，有效解决了联邦学习在物联网入侵检测中的能耗和数据异构性问题。

Abstract: In critical IoT environments, such as smart homes and industrial systems,
effective Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are essential for ensuring
security. However, developing robust IDS solutions remains a significant
challenge. Traditional machine learning-based IDS models typically require
large datasets, but data sharing is often limited due to privacy and security
concerns. Federated Learning (FL) presents a promising alternative by enabling
collaborative model training without sharing raw data. Despite its advantages,
FL still faces key challenges, such as data heterogeneity (non-IID data) and
high energy and computation costs, particularly for resource constrained IoT
devices. To address these issues, this paper proposes OptiFLIDS, a novel
approach that applies pruning techniques during local training to reduce model
complexity and energy consumption. It also incorporates a customized
aggregation method to better handle pruned models that differ due to non-IID
data distributions. Experiments conducted on three recent IoT IDS datasets,
TON_IoT, X-IIoTID, and IDSIoT2024, demonstrate that OptiFLIDS maintains strong
detection performance while improving energy efficiency, making it well-suited
for deployment in real-world IoT environments.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于扩散模型的源分离方法，无需对源进行显式假设，仅利用多视角观测数据即可解决源分离问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统源分离方法依赖简化的源模型，无法准确复现数据。扩散模型能够直接从噪声、不完整数据中学习复杂先验分布，为解决源分离问题提供了新思路。

Method: 利用扩散模型，仅基于多视角观测数据（即不同观测集包含未知源的不同线性变换）来解决源分离问题。该方法不要求单个源被单独观测，且能处理噪声、不完整和分辨率变化的观测数据。

Result: 该方法在合成问题和真实星系观测中均表现出有效性，能够从源先验中采样、评估候选源概率，并基于观测数据从源分布的联合后验中采样。

Conclusion: 扩散模型能够成功解决源分离问题，无需对源进行显式假设，为处理复杂观测数据提供了强大的工具。

Abstract: A common challenge in the natural sciences is to disentangle distinct,
unknown sources from observations. Examples of this source separation task
include deblending galaxies in a crowded field, distinguishing the activity of
individual neurons from overlapping signals, and separating seismic events from
an ambient background. Traditional analyses often rely on simplified source
models that fail to accurately reproduce the data. Recent advances have shown
that diffusion models can directly learn complex prior distributions from
noisy, incomplete data. In this work, we show that diffusion models can solve
the source separation problem without explicit assumptions about the source.
Our method relies only on multiple views, or the property that different sets
of observations contain different linear transformations of the unknown
sources. We show that our method succeeds even when no source is individually
observed and the observations are noisy, incomplete, and vary in resolution.
The learned diffusion models enable us to sample from the source priors,
evaluate the probability of candidate sources, and draw from the joint
posterior of the source distribution given an observation. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on a range of synthetic problems as well as
real-world galaxy observations.

Motivation: 研究神经网络权重矩阵在训练过程中的分布特性，探索超越简单独立同分布高斯模型的更准确表示方法，特别是在不同初始化、正则化、网络深度和宽度条件下的表现。

Method: 使用13参数置换不变高斯矩阵模型来建模权重矩阵分布，通过表示论模型参数和图论特征化置换不变矩阵可观测量，计算Wasserstein距离量化分布变化。

Result: 置换不变高斯矩阵模型在训练过程中能有效捕捉权重矩阵的相关高斯性，显著优于简单高斯模型，且能识别高斯性的小偏离。

Conclusion: 置换不变高斯矩阵模型为神经网络权重分布提供了可解释的建模框架，能够量化训练过程中的分布变化，并为开发更通用但保持可解释性的模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Ensembles of neural network weight matrices are studied through the training
process for the MNIST classification problem, testing the efficacy of matrix
models for representing their distributions, under assumptions of Gaussianity
and permutation-symmetry. The general 13-parameter permutation invariant
Gaussian matrix models are found to be effective models for the correlated
Gaussianity in the weight matrices, beyond the range of applicability of the
simple Gaussian with independent identically distributed matrix variables, and
notably well beyond the initialisation step. The representation theoretic model
parameters, and the graph-theoretic characterisation of the permutation
invariant matrix observables give an interpretable framework for the best-fit
model and for small departures from Gaussianity. Additionally, the Wasserstein
distance is calculated for this class of models and used to quantify the
movement of the distributions over training. Throughout the work, the effects
of varied initialisation regimes, regularisation, layer depth, and layer width
are tested for this formalism, identifying limits where particular departures
from Gaussianity are enhanced and how more general, yet still
highly-interpretable, models can be developed.

Motivation: AI模型越来越多地用于数据分析和可视化，但现有基准测试很少针对散点图特定任务，限制了对其性能的深入了解。

Method: 使用六个数据生成器和17种图表设计创建了18,000多个带注释的散点图数据集，通过N-shot提示评估OpenAI和Google的专有模型在五个任务上的表现。

Result: OpenAI模型和Gemini 2.5 Flash在计数任务上表现良好（准确率90%+），但在定位相关任务上表现不佳（精确率和召回率接近或低于50%）。图表设计对性能影响较小，但应避免宽高比过大或随机着色的散点图。

Conclusion: 当前AI模型在散点图分析中，计数任务表现可靠，但定位任务仍有待改进，建议避免特定的图表设计选择。

Abstract: AI models are increasingly used for data analysis and visualization, yet
benchmarks rarely address scatterplot-specific tasks, limiting insight into
performance. To address this gap for one of the most common chart types, we
introduce a synthetic, annotated dataset of over 18,000 scatterplots from six
data generators and 17 chart designs, and a benchmark based on it. We evaluate
proprietary models from OpenAI and Google using N-shot prompting on five
distinct tasks derived from annotations of cluster bounding boxes, their center
coordinates, and outlier coordinates. OpenAI models and Gemini 2.5 Flash,
especially when prompted with examples, are viable options for counting
clusters and, in Flash's case, outliers (90%+ Accuracy). However, the results
for localization-related tasks are unsatisfactory: Precision and Recall are
near or below 50%, except for Flash in outlier identification (65.01%).
Furthermore, the impact of chart design on performance appears to be a
secondary factor, but it is advisable to avoid scatterplots with wide aspect
ratios (16:9 and 21:9) or those colored randomly. Supplementary materials are

Method: 通过全球专家小组合作设计50个凝聚态理论问题，涵盖量子多体、经典统计力学等主题。开发了机器评分系统，包括通过正规排序处理非对易算子的符号处理。

Result: 前沿模型在所有问题上都表现挣扎，GPT5最佳模型仅解决30%问题，17个模型平均准确率11.4±2.1%。18个问题无模型能解决，26个问题最多只有一个模型能解决。答案有时违反基本对称性或具有非物理标度维度。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型在物理推理技能上存在明显差距。该基准将指导开发更强大的AI研究助手和导师，专家通过与LLM交互发现了创建更困难问题的策略。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in coding and
math problem-solving, but evaluation on advanced research-level problems in
hard sciences remains scarce. To fill this gap, we present CMT-Benchmark, a
dataset of 50 problems covering condensed matter theory (CMT) at the level of
an expert researcher. Topics span analytical and computational approaches in
quantum many-body, and classical statistical mechanics. The dataset was
designed and verified by a panel of expert researchers from around the world.
We built the dataset through a collaborative environment that challenges the
panel to write and refine problems they would want a research assistant to
solve, including Hartree-Fock, exact diagonalization, quantum/variational Monte
Carlo, density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), quantum/classical
statistical mechanics, and model building. We evaluate LLMs by programmatically
checking solutions against expert-supplied ground truth. We developed
machine-grading, including symbolic handling of non-commuting operators via
normal ordering. They generalize across tasks too. Our evaluations show that
frontier models struggle with all of the problems in the dataset, highlighting
a gap in the physical reasoning skills of current LLMs. Notably, experts
identified strategies for creating increasingly difficult problems by
interacting with the LLMs and exploiting common failure modes. The best model,
GPT5, solves 30\% of the problems; average across 17 models (GPT, Gemini,
Claude, DeepSeek, Llama) is 11.4$\pm$2.1\%. Moreover, 18 problems are solved by
none of the 17 models, and 26 by at most one. These unsolved problems span
Quantum Monte Carlo, Variational Monte Carlo, and DMRG. Answers sometimes
violate fundamental symmetries or have unphysical scaling dimensions. We
believe this benchmark will guide development toward capable AI research
assistants and tutors.

Motivation: 现有研究假设参数完全已知或预先估计，无法处理参数需要从数据中同时学习的情况。本文旨在开发一个统一框架，将优化和学习整合起来处理更灵活的问题类别。

Method: 提出两种算法：1) 朴素扩展APD方法，直接使用参数估计值进行原始对偶更新；2) 学习感知APD变体，通过调整动量更新显式考虑参数动态。后者还采用回溯策略实现自适应步长选择。

Result: 两种方法都达到O(logK/K)的收敛速率，学习感知方法获得更紧的O(1)常数，并在多最优解问题中扩展到O(1/√K)速率。在误设投资组合优化问题上展现优于现有算法的实证性能。

Conclusion: 本文成功开发了处理参数未知鞍点问题的统一框架，学习感知APD方法在理论和实证上都表现优异，为同时优化和学习的问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We study a class of misspecified saddle point (SP) problems, where the
optimization objective depends on an unknown parameter that must be learned
concurrently from data. Unlike existing studies that assume parameters are
fully known or pre-estimated, our framework integrates optimization and
learning into a unified formulation, enabling a more flexible problem class. To
address this setting, we propose two algorithms based on the accelerated
primal-dual (APD) by Hamedani & Aybat 2021. In particular, we first analyze the
naive extension of the APD method by directly substituting the evolving
parameter estimates into the primal-dual updates; then, we design a new
learning-aware variant of the APD method that explicitly accounts for parameter
dynamics by adjusting the momentum updates. Both methods achieve a provable
convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\log K / K)$, while the learning-aware
approach attains a tighter $\mathcal{O}(1)$ constant and further benefits from
an adaptive step-size selection enabled by a backtracking strategy.
Furthermore, we extend the framework to problems where the learning problem
admits multiple optimal solutions, showing that our modified algorithm for a
structured setting achieves an $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ rate. To demonstrate
practical impact, we evaluate our methods on a misspecified portfolio
optimization problem and show superior empirical performance compared to
state-of-the-art algorithms.

TL;DR: 使用LLM作为策略不可知的人类代理生成合成数据，以模拟人类决策，解决异构智能体团队中与策略不可访问或非平稳队友协作的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决异构智能体团队训练中与策略不可访问或非平稳队友（如人类）协作的挑战，避免依赖昂贵的人工参与数据。

Method: 在基于Stag Hunt的网格世界捕获游戏中，通过三个实验评估LLM作为人类代理的能力：比较LLM与人类参与者和专家的决策一致性；通过提示诱导风险敏感策略；在动态网格世界中测试LLM生成的动作轨迹。

Result: LLM在决策一致性上更接近专家而非普通参与者；能通过提示模拟人类的风险规避和风险寻求行为；生成的轨迹与人类参与者路径相似。

Conclusion: 虽然LLM尚不能完全复制人类适应性，但其基于提示的多样性为模拟策略不可知队友提供了可扩展的基础。

Abstract: A critical challenge in modelling Heterogeneous-Agent Teams is training
agents to collaborate with teammates whose policies are inaccessible or
non-stationary, such as humans. Traditional approaches rely on expensive
human-in-the-loop data, which limits scalability. We propose using Large
Language Models (LLMs) as policy-agnostic human proxies to generate synthetic
data that mimics human decision-making. To evaluate this, we conduct three
experiments in a grid-world capture game inspired by Stag Hunt, a game theory
paradigm that balances risk and reward. In Experiment 1, we compare decisions
from 30 human participants and 2 expert judges with outputs from LLaMA 3.1 and
Mixtral 8x22B models. LLMs, prompted with game-state observations and reward
structures, align more closely with experts than participants, demonstrating
consistency in applying underlying decision criteria. Experiment 2 modifies
prompts to induce risk-sensitive strategies (e.g. "be risk averse"). LLM
outputs mirror human participants' variability, shifting between risk-averse
and risk-seeking behaviours. Finally, Experiment 3 tests LLMs in a dynamic
grid-world where the LLM agents generate movement actions. LLMs produce
trajectories resembling human participants' paths. While LLMs cannot yet fully
replicate human adaptability, their prompt-guided diversity offers a scalable
foundation for simulating policy-agnostic teammates.

*Yuezhu Xu,S. Sivaranjani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展的神经网络Lipschitz常数估计框架，通过分解大型SDP为小规模子问题，显著提升计算效率，并能结合局部信息获得更紧的Lipschitz边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精确计算神经网络Lipschitz常数是NP难问题，现有方法需要求解大型半定规划，计算复杂度高且难以扩展到大型网络。同时，现有方法未能有效利用输入区域的局部信息来获得更紧的边界估计。

Method: 开发了广义SDP框架，支持异构激活函数斜率和任意输入输出对。将该SDP分解为一系列小规模子问题，计算复杂度与网络深度呈线性关系。还开发了通过闭式解实现瞬时计算的变体。进一步提出了ECLipsE-Gen-Local算法来有效结合局部输入信息。

Result: 实验表明，相比多种基准方法，所提算法实现了显著的速度提升，同时产生了比全局方法更紧的Lipschitz边界。当输入区域足够小时，算法提供的上界接近自动微分得到的精确Jacobian值。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种可扩展且紧的Lipschitz常数估计方法，其估计值与网络鲁棒性密切相关，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The Lipschitz constant is a key measure for certifying the robustness of
neural networks to input perturbations. However, computing the exact constant
is NP-hard, and standard approaches to estimate the Lipschitz constant involve
solving a large matrix semidefinite program (SDP) that scales poorly with
network size. Further, there is a potential to efficiently leverage local
information on the input region to provide tighter Lipschitz estimates. We
address this problem here by proposing a compositional framework that yields
tight yet scalable Lipschitz estimates for deep feedforward neural networks.
Specifically, we begin by developing a generalized SDP framework that is highly
flexible, accommodating heterogeneous activation function slope, and allowing
Lipschitz estimates with respect to arbitrary input-output pairs and arbitrary
choices of sub-networks of consecutive layers. We then decompose this
generalized SDP into a sequence of small sub-problems, with computational
complexity that scales linearly with respect to the network depth. We also
develop a variant that achieves near-instantaneous computation through
closed-form solutions to each sub-problem. All our algorithms are accompanied
by theoretical guarantees on feasibility and validity. Next, we develop a
series of algorithms, termed as ECLipsE-Gen-Local, that effectively incorporate
local information on the input. Our experiments demonstrate that our algorithms
achieve substantial speedups over a multitude of benchmarks while producing
significantly tighter Lipschitz bounds than global approaches. Moreover, we
show that our algorithms provide strict upper bounds for the Lipschitz constant
with values approaching the exact Jacobian from autodiff when the input region
is small enough. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of our approach
by showing that our Lipschitz estimates closely align with network robustness.

*Lulu Gong,Shreya Saxena*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Tensor-EM方法，结合张量矩方法和EM算法，在线性动态系统混合模型中提供全局可识别性保证和参数优化，在神经数据分析中表现优于纯张量方法或随机初始化EM方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性动态系统混合模型(MoLDS)能建模具有不同时间动态的时间序列数据，但在复杂噪声环境下应用受限。张量矩方法有全局可识别性保证但抗噪性差，EM方法灵活但对初始化敏感易陷局部最优。

Method: 使用输入输出数据构建矩张量来恢复混合权重和系统参数的全局一致估计，然后通过Kalman EM算法进行细化，对所有LDS参数进行闭式更新。

Result: 在合成数据上，Tensor-EM方法比纯张量或随机初始化EM方法具有更可靠的恢复性和更强的鲁棒性。在灵长类体感皮层神经记录中，成功建模并将不同条件聚类为独立子系统。

Conclusion: MoLDS为复杂神经数据建模提供了有效框架，Tensor-EM是学习MoLDS的可靠方法，在神经科学应用中具有实用价值。

Abstract: Mixtures of linear dynamical systems (MoLDS) provide a path to model
time-series data that exhibit diverse temporal dynamics across trajectories.
However, its application remains challenging in complex and noisy settings,
limiting its effectiveness for neural data analysis. Tensor-based moment
methods can provide global identifiability guarantees for MoLDS, but their
performance degrades under noise and complexity. Commonly used
expectation-maximization (EM) methods offer flexibility in fitting latent
models but are highly sensitive to initialization and prone to poor local
minima. Here, we propose a tensor-based method that provides identifiability
guarantees for learning MoLDS, which is followed by EM updates to combine the
strengths of both approaches. The novelty in our approach lies in the
construction of moment tensors using the input-output data to recover globally
consistent estimates of mixture weights and system parameters. These estimates
can then be refined through a Kalman EM algorithm, with closed-form updates for
all LDS parameters. We validate our framework on synthetic benchmarks and
real-world datasets. On synthetic data, the proposed Tensor-EM method achieves
more reliable recovery and improved robustness compared to either pure tensor
or randomly initialized EM methods. We then analyze neural recordings from the
primate somatosensory cortex while a non-human primate performs reaches in
different directions. Our method successfully models and clusters different
conditions as separate subsystems, consistent with supervised single-LDS fits
for each condition. Finally, we apply this approach to another neural dataset
where monkeys perform a sequential reaching task. These results demonstrate
that MoLDS provides an effective framework for modeling complex neural data,
and that Tensor-EM is a reliable approach to MoLDS learning for these
applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过消融研究比较了编码器专用模型和解码器专用模型在跨模态适应任务中的表现，发现解码器模型表现较差，并提出了两种新方法来提升其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管解码器专用模型在NLP领域表现出色且扩展性好，但大多数跨模态适应方法都专注于编码器专用模型，因此需要研究模型架构对跨模态适应方法的影响。

Method: 通过消融研究系统比较编码器和解码器模型在基于偏微分方程的时间相关模拟任务中的表现，并提出Parallel Flipping和Sequence Doubling两种新方法来模拟自回归模型中的双向性。

Result: 发现解码器专用模型在现有方法下表现远差于编码器模型，且扩展模型规模也无帮助。提出的两种新方法在所有任务和跨模态适应方法中都提升了解码器模型的性能，缩小了与编码器模型的差距。

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于拓宽用于跨模态适应任务的模型范围，进一步推动科学机器学习的发展。

Abstract: Large language models have shown great success on natural language tasks in
recent years, but they have also shown great promise when adapted to new
modalities, e.g., for scientific machine learning tasks. Even though
decoder-only models are more popular within NLP and scale exceedingly well at
generating natural language, most proposed approaches for cross-modal
adaptation focus on encoder-only models, raising the question of how model
architecture affects these approaches. In this paper, we therefore perform a
series of ablation studies to answer this question, systematically comparing
encoder-only and decoder-only models on cross-modal adaptation for
time-dependent simulation tasks based on partial differential equations (PDEs).
We find that decoder-only models are far worse than encoder-only models, when
existing approaches are applied unmodified. In contrast to several other
domains, scaling decoder-only models also does not help. To harness the
potential of decoder-only models in this context, we introduce two novel
approaches, Parallel Flipping and Sequence Doubling, attempting to mimic
bidirectionality in autoregressive models. Both our methods improve overall
performance using decoder-only models for all tasks and all cross-model
adaptation methods, closing the gap to encoder-only model performance. We hope
that our findings broaden the spectrum of models used on cross-modal adaptation
tasks to further scientific ML.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Action Gradient (AG)方法来解决Decision Transformer在离线强化学习中的轨迹拼接和动作外推问题，通过直接调整动作来优化Q值，显著提升了DT算法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decision Transformer将强化学习与transformer结合，但将目标从最大化累积奖励改为最大化动作似然，这带来了轨迹拼接和动作外推两个关键挑战。现有方法单独解决这些问题但组合时性能不稳定。

Method: 提出Action Gradient方法，利用动作对Q值的梯度来优化动作，实现与策略梯度类似的功能，同时能与token预测技术高效集成。

Result: 实证结果表明该方法能显著提升基于DT的算法性能，部分结果达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: Action Gradient方法有效解决了DT在离线强化学习中的关键挑战，提供了稳定且高效的性能提升方案。

Abstract: Decision Transformer (DT), which integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with
the transformer model, introduces a novel approach to offline RL. Unlike
classical algorithms that take maximizing cumulative discounted rewards as
objective, DT instead maximizes the likelihood of actions. This paradigm shift,
however, presents two key challenges: stitching trajectories and extrapolation
of action. Existing methods, such as substituting specific tokens with
predictive values and integrating the Policy Gradient (PG) method, address
these challenges individually but fail to improve performance stably when
combined due to inherent instability. To address this, we propose Action
Gradient (AG), an innovative methodology that directly adjusts actions to
fulfill a function analogous to that of PG, while also facilitating efficient
integration with token prediction techniques. AG utilizes the gradient of the
Q-value with respect to the action to optimize the action. The empirical
results demonstrate that our method can significantly enhance the performance
of DT-based algorithms, with some results achieving state-of-the-art levels.

Motivation: 研究深度神经网络图结构的挫折水平，以测试其与结构平衡的接近程度，从统计物理和功能角度理解网络的有序行为。

Method: 计算深度卷积神经网络签名图的挫折水平，与零模型进行比较，从Ising自旋玻璃模型和功能单调性角度分析。

Result: 所有预训练深度卷积神经网络的挫折水平都低于零模型预期，表现出近单调行为，网络有序程度高于预期。

Conclusion: 深度卷积神经网络倾向于表现出比零模型更有序的行为，这暗示了一种新型的隐式正则化机制。

Abstract: For the signed graph associated to a deep neural network, one can compute the
frustration level, i.e., test how close or distant the graph is to structural
balance. For all the pretrained deep convolutional neural networks we consider,
we find that the frustration is always less than expected from null models.
From a statistical physics point of view, and in particular in reference to an
Ising spin glass model, the reduced frustration indicates that the amount of
disorder encoded in the network is less than in the null models. From a
functional point of view, low frustration (i.e., proximity to structural
balance) means that the function representing the network behaves
near-monotonically, i.e., more similarly to a monotone function than in the
null models. Evidence of near-monotonic behavior along the partial order
determined by frustration is observed for all networks we consider. This
confirms that the class of deep convolutional neural networks tends to have a
more ordered behavior than expected from null models, and suggests a novel form
of implicit regularization.

Conclusion: 通过差分隐私优化算法增强和可本地化LLM设计，有效解决了LLM的安全和隐私问题，为在消费级设备上安全运行专用语言模型提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have evolved into powerful and
ubiquitous tools. Fine-tuning on small datasets allows LLMs to acquire
specialized skills for specific tasks efficiently. Although LLMs provide great
utility in both general and task-specific use cases, they are limited by two
security-related concerns. First, traditional LLM hardware requirements make
them infeasible to run locally on consumer-grade devices. A remote network
connection with the LLM provider's server is usually required, making the
system vulnerable to network attacks. Second, fine-tuning an LLM for a
sensitive task may involve sensitive data. Non-private fine-tuning algorithms
produce models vulnerable to training data reproduction attacks. Our work
addresses these security concerns by enhancing differentially private
optimization algorithms and applying them to fine-tune localizable language
models. We introduce adaptable gradient clipping along with other engineering
enhancements to the standard DP-Adam optimizer to create DP-Adam-AC. We use our
optimizer to fine-tune examples of two localizable LLM designs, small language
model (Qwen2.5-0.5B) and 1.58 bit quantization (Bitnet-b1.58-2B). We
demonstrate promising improvements in loss through experimentation with two
synthetic datasets.

Abstract: We study the cosine similarity of sentence transformer embeddings and observe
that they are well modeled by gamma mixtures. From a fixed corpus, we measure
similarities between all document embeddings and a reference query embedding.
Empirically we find that these distributions are often well captured by a gamma
distribution shifted and truncated to [-1,1], and in many cases, by a gamma
mixture. We propose a heuristic model in which a hierarchical clustering of
topics naturally leads to a gamma-mixture structure in the similarity scores.
Finally, we outline an expectation-maximization algorithm for fitting shifted
gamma mixtures, which provides a practical tool for modeling similarity
distributions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对抗训练中使用的MSE正则化在优化过程中过于均匀，限制了对抗鲁棒性。需要设计更灵活的正则化方法来改进对抗训练效果。

Method: 1. 加权对抗互正则化：提出分解的对抗互KL散度损失，允许为主目标和辅助目标分配不同权重；2. 对抗泛化正则化：在对抗训练目标中引入额外的干净目标分布。

Result: 大量实验表明，所提出的方法相比现有基于正则化的方法显著提高了对抗鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过重新审视互学习思想并设计专门针对对抗训练的正则化策略，可以有效提升模型的对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: Adversarial training is the most effective defense against adversarial
attacks. The effectiveness of the adversarial attacks has been on the design of
its loss function and regularization term. The most widely used loss function
in adversarial training is cross-entropy and mean squared error (MSE) as its
regularization objective. However, MSE enforces overly uniform optimization
between two output distributions during training, which limits its robustness
in adversarial training scenarios. To address this issue, we revisit the idea
of mutual learning (originally designed for knowledge distillation) and propose
two novel regularization strategies tailored for adversarial training: (i)
weighted adversarial mutual regularization and (ii) adversarial generalization
regularization. In the former, we formulate a decomposed adversarial mutual
Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL-divergence) loss, which allows flexible control
over the optimization process by assigning unequal weights to the main and
auxiliary objectives. In the latter, we introduce an additional clean target
distribution into the adversarial training objective, improving generalization
and enhancing model robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
proposed methods significantly improve adversarial robustness compared to
existing regularization-based approaches.

Conclusion: TRNN模型能够有效处理高维张量数据，在保持几何结构的同时实现非线性建模

Abstract: Modern sensing and metrology systems now stream terabytes of heterogeneous,
high-dimensional (HD) data profiles, images, and dense point clouds, whose
natural representation is multi-way tensors. Understanding such data requires
regression models that preserve tensor geometry, yet remain expressive enough
to capture the pronounced nonlinear interactions that dominate many industrial
and mechanical processes. Existing tensor-based regressors meet the first
requirement but remain essentially linear. Conversely, conventional neural
networks offer nonlinearity only after flattening, thereby discarding spatial
structure and incurring prohibitive parameter counts. This paper introduces a
Tensor-on-Tensor Regression Neural Network (TRNN) that unifies these two
paradigms.

TL;DR: MADPO提出了一种基于边距自适应的直接偏好优化方法，通过实例级调整解决DPO固定温度参数的问题，在情感生成任务中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO的固定温度参数在处理多样化偏好数据时会导致次优训练，容易对简单样本过拟合，而对信息丰富的样本学习不足。现有方法如IPO和β-DPO各有局限性。

Method: 采用两步法：首先训练奖励模型估计偏好边距，然后使用这些边距为每个训练样本的DPO损失应用连续自适应权重，对困难样本放大学习信号，对简单样本减弱信号。

Result: 在情感生成任务中，MADPO在不同质量数据集上均显著优于基线方法，在高质量数据上性能提升达33.3%，在低质量数据上提升10.5%。

Conclusion: MADPO为偏好对齐提供了一种更稳健和原则性的方法，具有良好优化的理论保证和对奖励模型估计误差的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simple and effective
method for aligning large language models. However, its reliance on a fixed
temperature parameter leads to suboptimal training on diverse preference data,
causing overfitting on easy examples and under-learning from informative ones.
Recent methods have emerged to counter this. While IPO addresses general
overfitting, its uniform regularization can be overly conservative. The more
targeted approach of $\beta$-DPO suffers from its own limitations: its
batch-level adaptation applies a single, compromised temperature to
mixed-margin pairs, its linear update rule can produce unstable negative
$\beta$ values, and its filtering mechanism discards potentially useful
training signals. In this work, we introduce Margin-Adaptive Direct Preference
Optimization (MADPO), a method that provides a stable, data-preserving, and
instance-level solution. MADPO employs a practical two-step approach: it first
trains a reward model to estimate preference margins and then uses these
margins to apply a continuous, adaptive weight to the DPO loss for each
individual training sample. This re-weighting scheme creates an effective
target margin that is amplified for hard pairs and dampened for easy pairs,
allowing for granular control over the learning signal. We provide a
comprehensive theoretical analysis, proving that MADPO has a well-behaved
optimization landscape and is robust to reward model estimation errors. We
validate our theory with experiments on a sentiment generation task, where
MADPO consistently and significantly outperforms strong baselines across
datasets of varying quality. It achieves performance gains of up to +33.3\% on
High Quality data and +10.5\% on Low Quality data over the next-best method.
Our results establish MADPO as a more robust and principled approach to
preference alignment.

Abstract: We propose Physics-informed Attention-enhanced Fourier Neural Operator
(PIANO) to solve the Nonlinear Force-Free Field (NLFFF) problem in solar
physics. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on iterative numerical
methods, our proposed PIANO directly learns the 3D magnetic field structure
from 2D boundary conditions. Specifically, PIANO integrates Efficient Channel
Attention (ECA) mechanisms with Dilated Convolutions (DC), which enhances the
model's ability to capture multimodal input by prioritizing critical channels
relevant to the magnetic field's variations. Furthermore, we apply
physics-informed loss by enforcing the force-free and divergence-free
conditions in the training process so that our prediction is consistent with
underlying physics with high accuracy. Experimental results on the ISEE NLFFF
dataset show that our PIANO not only outperforms state-of-the-art neural
operators in terms of accuracy but also shows strong consistency with the
physical characteristics of NLFFF data across magnetic fields reconstructed
from various solar active regions. The GitHub of this project is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式数据并行训练中频繁的梯度通信会占用带宽，而不频繁通信策略（如Local SGD）在自适应优化器上存在性能差距

Method: 使用多个慢速和快速移动的一阶动量来跟踪不同时间尺度的更新动态，提供收敛保证

Result: 在语言模型预训练中消除了与DDP的性能差距，在以太网互连上减少6-27%的等token训练时间，720M规模下达到目标困惑度的步数减少24%，时间减少35%

Conclusion: MT-DAO实现了有效的跨数据中心训练和广域地理范围训练

Abstract: Training large models with distributed data parallelism (DDP) requires
frequent communication of gradients across workers, which can saturate
bandwidth. Infrequent communication strategies (e.g., Local SGD) reduce this
overhead but, when applied to adaptive optimizers, often suffer a performance
gap relative to fully synchronous DDP. We trace this gap to a time-scale
mismatch: the optimizer's fast-moving momentum, tuned for frequent updates,
decays too quickly to smooth gradients over long intervals, leading to
noise-dominated optimization. To address this, we propose MT-DAO, a family of
optimizers that employs multiple slow- and fast-moving first momenta or the
gradient to track update dynamics across different time scales, for which we
provide the first convergence guarantees. Empirically, for language-model
pre-training, this eliminates the performance gap with DDP, outperforming
infrequent-communication baselines in perplexity and reducing iso-token
wall-clock time by 6-27% on Ethernet interconnects. At the 720M scale, MT-DAO
reaches a target perplexity in 24% fewer steps and 35% less time than the
single-momentum DDP baseline. MT-DAO enables effective cross-datacenter
training and training over wide geographic areas.

<details>

Motivation: 极低精度（如2位）KV缓存量化会引入显著误差，这些误差通过点积注意力机制传播，最终降低生成质量。

Method: KVLinC结合Hadamard旋转（减少值量化误差）和轻量级线性校正适配器（补偿量化键引入的误差），并实现自定义注意力内核。

Result: 在LLaMA、Qwen2.5和Qwen3模型系列上，KVLinC始终匹配或超越强基线，同时实现更高的KV缓存压缩，推理速度比Flash Attention基线快达2.55倍。

Conclusion: KVLinC框架有效解决了极低精度KV缓存量化问题，实现了高效的长期上下文LLM推理。

Abstract: Quantizing the key-value (KV) cache is a promising strategy for improving the
inference efficiency of large language models (LLMs). However, aggressive
quantization to very low precision (e.g., 2 bits) introduces significant errors
in the stored key and value tensors, which propagate through the dot-product
attention mechanism and ultimately degrade generation quality. To address this,
we propose KVLinC, a framework to mitigate attention errors introduced by KV
cache quantization in the extreme low-precision regime. KVLinC combines a
Hadamard rotation, which reduces quantization error in values, with lightweight
linear correction adapters that explicitly compensate for errors introduced by
quantized keys. Across extensive evaluations on the LLaMA, Qwen2.5, and Qwen3
model families, KVLinC consistently matches or surpasses strong baselines while
achieving higher KV-cache compression. Furthermore, we implement a custom
attention kernel that results in upto 2.55x faster inference compared to Flash
Attention baseline, enabling efficient long-context LLM inference.

TL;DR: 提出了Spectral PINNSformer (S-Pformer)，一种改进的Transformer-based PINN架构，通过移除冗余编码器和集成傅里叶特征嵌入来解决参数冗余和频谱偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统PINNSformer中编码器冗余导致的参数增加问题，以及缓解神经网络中的频谱偏差现象。

Method: 重新设计PINNSformer架构，移除不必要的编码器，仅依赖自注意力机制捕获时空相关性，并集成傅里叶特征嵌入来显式缓解频谱偏差。

Result: 在所有基准测试中优于编码器-解码器PINNSformer架构，达到或超过MLP性能，同时显著减少参数数量。

Conclusion: S-Pformer通过架构简化和频谱偏差缓解，实现了更高效的PINN解决方案，在保持性能的同时大幅降低模型复杂度。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a useful framework for
approximating partial differential equation solutions using deep learning
methods. In this paper, we propose a principled redesign of the PINNsformer, a
Transformer-based PINN architecture. We present the Spectral PINNSformer
(S-Pformer), a refinement of encoder-decoder PINNSformers that addresses two
key issues; 1. the redundancy (i.e. increased parameter count) of the encoder,
and 2. the mitigation of spectral bias. We find that the encoder is unnecessary
for capturing spatiotemporal correlations when relying solely on
self-attention, thereby reducing parameter count. Further, we integrate Fourier
feature embeddings to explicitly mitigate spectral bias, enabling adaptive
encoding of multiscale behaviors in the frequency domain. Our model outperforms
encoder-decoder PINNSformer architectures across all benchmarks, achieving or
outperforming MLP performance while reducing parameter count significantly.

### [244] [A Neural Network Algorithm for KL Divergence Estimation with Quantitative Error Bounds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05386)
*Mikil Foss,Andrew Lamperski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种使用随机特征浅层神经网络估计KL散度的算法，证明能以高概率实现O(m^{-1/2}+T^{-1/3})的估计误差，其中m是神经元数量，T是算法步数和样本数。


<details>

Motivation: 传统信息论估计器在高维和/或大样本情况下性能较差，现有神经网络方法虽然理论上存在低误差参数，但无法保证实际算法能达到低误差。

Method: 使用具有随机隐藏权重和偏置的浅层神经网络（随机特征方法）来估计KL散度。

Result: 算法以高概率实现KL散度估计误差为O(m^{-1/2}+T^{-1/3})，其中m是神经元数量，T是算法步数和样本数。

Conclusion: 提出的随机特征神经网络方法能够有效估计KL散度，并提供了理论保证的误差界限。

Abstract: Estimating the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between random variables is a
fundamental problem in statistical analysis. For continuous random variables,
traditional information-theoretic estimators scale poorly with dimension and/or
sample size. To mitigate this challenge, a variety of methods have been
proposed to estimate KL divergences and related quantities, such as mutual
information, using neural networks. The existing theoretical analyses show that
neural network parameters achieving low error exist. However, since they rely
on non-constructive neural network approximation theorems, they do not
guarantee that the existing algorithms actually achieve low error. In this
paper, we propose a KL divergence estimation algorithm using a shallow neural
network with randomized hidden weights and biases (i.e. a random feature
method). We show that with high probability, the algorithm achieves a KL
divergence estimation error of $O(m^{-1/2}+T^{-1/3})$, where $m$ is the number
of neurons and $T$ is both the number of steps of the algorithm and the number
of samples.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient temperature prediction is critical for optimizing the
preheating process of PET preforms in industrial microwave systems prior to
blow molding. We propose a novel deep learning framework for generalized
temperature prediction. Unlike traditional models that require extensive
retraining for each material or design variation, our method introduces a
data-efficient neural architecture that leverages transfer learning and model
fusion to generalize across unseen scenarios. By pretraining specialized neural
regressor on distinct conditions such as recycled PET heat capacities or
varying preform geometries and integrating their representations into a unified
global model, we create a system capable of learning shared thermal dynamics
across heterogeneous inputs. The architecture incorporates skip connections to
enhance stability and prediction accuracy. Our approach reduces the need for
large simulation datasets while achieving superior performance compared to
models trained from scratch. Experimental validation on two case studies
material variability and geometric diversity demonstrates significant
improvements in generalization, establishing a scalable ML-based solution for
intelligent thermal control in manufacturing environments. Moreover, the
approach highlights how data-efficient generalization strategies can extend to
other industrial applications involving complex physical modeling with limited
data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文使用基于LSTM的seq2seq深度学习模型预测太阳质子事件后24小时的质子通量时间剖面，通过多种预测场景比较发现：一次性预测优于自回归预测，趋势平滑数据能提升质子+X射线模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 太阳质子事件对卫星、宇航员和技术系统造成严重辐射危害，准确预测质子通量时间剖面对于早期预警和缓解措施至关重要。

Method: 使用40个SPE事件数据集，基于LSTM的seq2seq模型，采用4折分层交叉验证，比较不同配置：质子输入vs质子+X射线输入、原始数据vs趋势平滑数据、自回归vs一次性预测。

Result: 一次性预测误差低于自回归预测；原始数据上质子模型优于质子+X射线模型，但趋势平滑后差距缩小或逆转；趋势平滑显著提升质子+X射线模型性能；趋势平滑数据模型平均表现最佳，但最佳模型来自原始数据训练。

Conclusion: LSTM seq2seq模型能有效预测SPE质子通量，一次性预测策略和适当的数据预处理能提升预测精度，模型架构选择有时比数据预处理更重要。

Abstract: Solar Proton Events (SPEs) cause significant radiation hazards to satellites,
astronauts, and technological systems. Accurate forecasting of their proton
flux time profiles is crucial for early warnings and mitigation. This paper
explores deep learning sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models based on Long
Short-Term Memory networks to predict 24-hour proton flux profiles following
SPE onsets. We used a dataset of 40 well-connected SPEs (1997-2017) observed by
NOAA GOES, each associated with a >=M-class western-hemisphere solar flare and
undisturbed proton flux profiles. Using 4-fold stratified cross-validation, we
evaluate seq2seq model configurations (varying hidden units and embedding
dimensions) under multiple forecasting scenarios: (i) proton-only input vs.
combined proton+X-ray input, (ii) original flux data vs. trend-smoothed data,
and (iii) autoregressive vs. one-shot forecasting. Our major results are as
follows: First, one-shot forecasting consistently yields lower error than
autoregressive prediction, avoiding the error accumulation seen in iterative
approaches. Second, on the original data, proton-only models outperform
proton+X-ray models. However, with trend-smoothed data, this gap narrows or
reverses in proton+X-ray models. Third, trend-smoothing significantly enhances
the performance of proton+X-ray models by mitigating fluctuations in the X-ray
channel. Fourth, while models trained on trendsmoothed data perform best on
average, the best-performing model was trained on original data, suggesting
that architectural choices can sometimes outweigh the benefits of data
preprocessing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前DP-SGD与普通SGD训练存在较大精度差距，DP-MF方法通过关联不同迭代中的隐私噪声来改善性能，但噪声关联质量有待提高。

Method: 使用公开未标记数据估计模型曲率，基于曲率信息改进DP-MF中的跨迭代噪声相关性计算。

Result: 在多个数据集、模型和隐私参数上的实验表明，NoiseCurve相比DP-MF的关联方案能带来一致且显著的精度提升。

Conclusion: NoiseCurve通过利用模型曲率信息有效改善了差分隐私训练中的噪声关联质量，为隐私保护深度学习提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) offers the
promise of training deep learning models while mitigating many privacy risks.
However, there is currently a large accuracy gap between DP-SGD and normal SGD
training. This has resulted in different lines of research investigating
orthogonal ways of improving privacy-preserving training. One such line of
work, known as DP-MF, correlates the privacy noise across different iterations
of stochastic gradient descent -- allowing later iterations to cancel out some
of the noise added to earlier iterations. In this paper, we study how to
improve this noise correlation. We propose a technique called NoiseCurve that
uses model curvature, estimated from public unlabeled data, to improve the
quality of this cross-iteration noise correlation. Our experiments on various
datasets, models, and privacy parameters show that the noise correlations
computed by NoiseCurve offer consistent and significant improvements in
accuracy over the correlation scheme used by DP-MF.

*Shrenik Bhansali,Larry Heck*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DVI是一种训练感知的自推测解码框架，通过将LLM划分为起草器和验证器，在推理过程中进行持续在线学习，实现无损加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归解码是大型语言模型的主要延迟瓶颈，现有推测解码方法需要大量离线训练或额外组件，成本高且在分布漂移下脆弱。

Method: 将LLM划分为起草器和验证器，在生成过程中将验证器的接受/拒绝决策转化为监督信号来更新起草器头，采用KL→RL调度策略进行在线蒸馏和策略梯度训练。

Result: 在Spec-Bench上实现2.16倍加速，与EAGLE-2等SOTA方法相当，但训练数据量少几个数量级。

Conclusion: 训练感知的自推测能够在最小训练开销下实现最先进的无损加速。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) decoding is a major latency bottleneck for large language
models. Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates AR by letting a drafter propose
multi-token blocks that a verifier accepts or rejects. However, many SD systems
require heavy offline training or extra components. These choices raise
data/compute cost and can yield brittle drafters under distribution drift. We
introduce \emph{Draft, Verify, \& Improve (DVI)}, a training-aware
self-speculative framework that combines inference with continual online
learning. We partition an LLM into a drafter and a verifier, and during
generation, verifier accept/reject decisions are converted into supervision
signals and used to update the drafter head. A simple \emph{KL$\rightarrow$RL}
schedule bootstraps calibration via online distillation and then adds
reward-masked cross-entropy with a on-policy policy-gradient term, preserving
lossless, single model deployment. On Spec-Bench, DVI achieves a $2.16\times$
wall-time speedup, on par with SoTA approaches like EAGLE-2, while orders of
magnitude less data for training, and ablations show that DVI outperforms
KL-only online distillation. DVI demonstrates that \emph{training-aware}
self-speculation can deliver state-of-the-art, lossless speedups with minimal
training overhead.

Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) is emerging as a potentially
transformative paradigm for modeling complex biomedical systems by integrating
parameterized physical laws with data-driven methods. Here, we review three
main classes of PIML frameworks: physics-informed neural networks (PINNs),
neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), and neural operators (NOs),
highlighting their growing role in biomedical science and engineering. We begin
with PINNs, which embed governing equations into deep learning models and have
been successfully applied to biosolid and biofluid mechanics, mechanobiology,
and medical imaging among other areas. We then review NODEs, which offer
continuous-time modeling, especially suited to dynamic physiological systems,
pharmacokinetics, and cell signaling. Finally, we discuss deep NOs as powerful
tools for learning mappings between function spaces, enabling efficient
simulations across multiscale and spatially heterogeneous biological domains.
Throughout, we emphasize applications where physical interpretability, data
scarcity, or system complexity make conventional black-box learning
insufficient. We conclude by identifying open challenges and future directions
for advancing PIML in biomedical science and engineering, including issues of
uncertainty quantification, generalization, and integration of PIML and large
language models.

TL;DR: ARLAS框架通过对抗性强化学习训练LLM代理，使其能够抵御多样化的间接提示注入攻击，同时提高任务完成率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法依赖手工制作的攻击模式数据集，缺乏多样性，无法应对新型提示注入攻击，存在安全风险。

Method: 采用两方零和博弈的对抗性强化学习框架，同时训练攻击者和防御者LLM，并使用基于种群的学习防止循环学习。

Result: 在BrowserGym和AgentDojo上的评估显示，ARLAS训练的代理攻击成功率显著降低，任务成功率提高。

Conclusion: 对抗性过程生成了多样且具有挑战性的攻击，相比基础模型产生了更鲁棒的代理。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents can leverage tools such as Google Search to
complete complex tasks. However, this tool usage introduces the risk of
indirect prompt injections, where malicious instructions hidden in tool outputs
can manipulate the agent, posing security risks like data leakage. Current
defense strategies typically rely on fine-tuning LLM agents on datasets of
known attacks. However, the generation of these datasets relies on manually
crafted attack patterns, which limits their diversity and leaves agents
vulnerable to novel prompt injections. To address this limitation, we propose
Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Agent Safety (ARLAS), a novel framework
that leverages adversarial reinforcement learning (RL) by formulating the
problem as a two-player zero-sum game. ARLAS co-trains two LLMs: an attacker
that learns to autonomously generate diverse prompt injections and an agent
that learns to defend against them while completing its assigned tasks. To
ensure robustness against a wide range of attacks and to prevent cyclic
learning, we employ a population-based learning framework that trains the agent
to defend against all previous attacker checkpoints. Evaluated on BrowserGym
and AgentDojo, agents fine-tuned with ARLAS achieve a significantly lower
attack success rate than the original model while also improving their task
success rate. Our analysis further confirms that the adversarial process
generates a diverse and challenging set of attacks, leading to a more robust
agent compared to the base model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究元强化学习，提出两种基于随机值函数的Thompson风格算法MTSRL和MTSRL⁺，通过高斯元先验学习任务间共享的最优动作值函数结构，实现了优于先验独立方法的元遗憾保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在有限时间MDP中，相关任务的最优动作值函数具有相似结构，通过元学习利用这种结构可以提高学习效率，但现有方法缺乏对Thompson风格RL与学习Q先验的元遗憾理论保证。

Method: 提出MTSRL（仅学习先验均值）和MTSRL⁺（额外估计协方差并使用先验扩展）两种算法，采用线性表示Q*_h(s,a)=Φ_h(s,a)θ^(k)_h，结合高斯元先验和先验对齐技术。

Result: 在已知协方差时获得Õ(H⁴S³/²√(ANK))元遗憾，学习协方差时获得Õ(H⁴S³/²√(AN³K))元遗憾，当任务数K足够大时优于先验独立方法。实验显示MTSRL/MTSRL⁺能快速跟踪元预言机并显著优于基线。

Conclusion: 这是首个为Thompson风格RL与学习Q先验提供元遗憾理论保证的工作，为实验丰富场景提供了实用方法（通过RLSVI预热、OLS聚合、协方差扩展）。

Abstract: We study meta-reinforcement learning in finite-horizon MDPs where related
tasks share similar structures in their optimal action-value functions.
Specifically, we posit a linear representation
$Q^*_h(s,a)=\Phi_h(s,a)\,\theta^{(k)}_h$ and place a Gaussian meta-prior $
\mathcal{N}(\theta^*_h,\Sigma^*_h)$ over the task-specific parameters
$\theta^{(k)}_h$. Building on randomized value functions, we propose two
Thompson-style algorithms: (i) MTSRL, which learns only the prior mean and
performs posterior sampling with the learned mean and known covariance; and
(ii) $\text{MTSRL}^{+}$, which additionally estimates the covariance and
employs prior widening to control finite-sample estimation error. Further, we
develop a prior-alignment technique that couples the posterior under the
learned prior with a meta-oracle that knows the true prior, yielding
meta-regret guarantees: we match prior-independent Thompson sampling in the
small-task regime and strictly improve with more tasks once the prior is
learned. Concretely, for known covariance we obtain
$\tilde{O}(H^{4}S^{3/2}\sqrt{ANK})$ meta-regret, and with learned covariance
$\tilde{O}(H^{4}S^{3/2}\sqrt{AN^3K})$; both recover a better behavior than
prior-independent after $K \gtrsim \tilde{O}(H^2)$ and $K \gtrsim
\tilde{O}(N^2H^2)$, respectively. Simulations on a stateful recommendation
environment (with feature and prior misspecification) show that after brief
exploration, MTSRL/MTSRL\(^+\) track the meta-oracle and substantially
outperform prior-independent RL and bandit-only meta-baselines. Our results
give the first meta-regret guarantees for Thompson-style RL with learned
Q-priors, and provide practical recipes (warm-start via RLSVI, OLS aggregation,
covariance widening) for experiment-rich settings.

Conclusion: Quantile DeepGR4J框架能够有效量化径流预测的不确定性，提高预测准确性，并可用于洪水风险评估和早期预警。

Abstract: Conceptual rainfall-runoff models aid hydrologists and climate scientists in
modelling streamflow to inform water management practices. Recent advances in
deep learning have unravelled the potential for combining hydrological models
with deep learning models for better interpretability and improved predictive
performance. In our previous work, we introduced DeepGR4J, which enhanced the
GR4J conceptual rainfall-runoff model using a deep learning model to serve as a
surrogate for the routing component. DeepGR4J had an improved rainfall-runoff
prediction accuracy, particularly in arid catchments. Quantile regression
models have been extensively used for quantifying uncertainty while aiding
extreme value forecasting. In this paper, we extend DeepGR4J using a quantile
regression-based ensemble learning framework to quantify uncertainty in
streamflow prediction. We also leverage the uncertainty bounds to identify
extreme flow events potentially leading to flooding. We further extend the
model to multi-step streamflow predictions for uncertainty bounds. We design
experiments for a detailed evaluation of the proposed framework using the
CAMELS-Aus dataset. The results show that our proposed Quantile DeepGR4J
framework improves the predictive accuracy and uncertainty interval quality
(interval score) compared to baseline deep learning models. Furthermore, we
carry out flood risk evaluation using Quantile DeepGR4J, and the results
demonstrate its suitability as an early warning system.

TL;DR: 提出了自适应混合位激活量化(AMAQ)方法，通过渐进式压缩激活和梯度来减少大语言模型分布式训练的通信开销，在相同比特预算下优于固定精度方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型规模快速增长，在服务器-客户端分布式训练中面临通信效率和计算开销的挑战，特别是在低资源设备上的协作训练。

Method: 引入自适应混合位激活量化(AMAQ)，基于特征和层级重要性通过比特正则化分配比特预算，将激活和梯度从高精度(6-8位)渐进压缩到低精度(3-4位)。

Result: 在相同比特预算下，AMAQ相比固定精度方法在LLaMA3 8B和Qwen2.5 7B模型上分别获得约2.5%的生成准确率和1.3%的分类准确率提升，同时显著增强训练稳定性。

Conclusion: AMAQ在实际多机协作训练中有效集成，以适度的通信开销提供优越的推理准确率，是实现最小通信成本协作训练的实用有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are scaling rapidly, creating significant
challenges for collaborative server client distributed training, particularly
in terms of communication efficiency and computational overheads. To address
these challenges, we implement Parameter-efficient Split Learning, which
effectively balances efficiency and performance for collaborative training on
low-resource devices.
  To reduce communication overhead in collaborative training, we introduce
Adaptive Mixed bit Activation Quantization (AMAQ), a strategy that
progressively compresses activations and gradients from high precision (6 to 8
bits) to low precision (3 to 4 bits). AMAQ achieves this by effectively
allocating bit budgets across channels based on feature wise and layer wise
importance using bit regularization.
  Under the same bit budgets, AMAQ outperforms fixed-precision approaches,
delivering about 2.5% higher generation accuracy and about 1.3% better
classification accuracy for models like LLaMA3 8B and Qwen2.5 7B. In addition,
it significantly enhances training stability and reducing ultra-low bit
representation collapse during the training.
  Experiments demonstrate that AMAQ integrates effectively into practical
multi-machine collaborative training setups, offering superior inference
accuracy with only a modest communication overhead for bits adaptation during
training. This trade off makes AMAQ a practical and effective solution for
collaborative training with minimal communication cost.

Motivation: 现有机器学习分子动力学方法通常强制严格等变性、依赖顺序展开，限制了灵活性和模拟效率；且多为单任务训练，限制了在未见化合物和扩展时间步上的泛化能力。

Method: 采用准等变设计，无需显式分子图；使用时间注意力机制，允许准确并行解码多个未来状态；在TG80数据集（包含80种化合物超过250万飞秒轨迹）上进行多任务预训练。

Conclusion: ATOM代表了向准确、高效和可迁移分子动力学模型迈出的重要一步。

Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations underpin modern computational drug dis-
covery, materials science, and biochemistry. Recent machine learning models
provide high-fidelity MD predictions without the need to repeatedly solve
quantum mechanical forces, enabling significant speedups over conventional
pipelines. Yet many such methods typically enforce strict equivariance and rely
on sequential rollouts, thus limiting their flexibility and simulation
efficiency. They are also com- monly single-task, trained on individual
molecules and fixed timeframes, which restricts generalization to unseen
compounds and extended timesteps. To address these issues, we propose Atomistic
Transformer Operator for Molecules (ATOM), a pretrained transformer neural
operator for multitask molecular dynamics. ATOM adopts a quasi-equivariant
design that requires no explicit molecular graph and employs a temporal
attention mechanism, allowing for the accurate parallel decod- ing of multiple
future states. To support operator pretraining across chemicals and timescales,
we curate TG80, a large, diverse, and numerically stable MD dataset with over
2.5 million femtoseconds of trajectories across 80 compounds. ATOM achieves
state-of-the-art performance on established single-task benchmarks, such as
MD17, RMD17 and MD22. After multitask pretraining on TG80, ATOM shows
exceptional zero-shot generalization to unseen molecules across varying time
hori- zons. We believe ATOM represents a significant step toward accurate,
efficient, and transferable molecular dynamics models

Abstract: Training - the optimisation of complex models - is traditionally performed
through small, local, iterative updates [D. E. Rumelhart, G. E. Hinton, R. J.
Williams, Nature 323, 533-536 (1986)]. Approximating solutions through
truncated gradients is a paradigm dating back to Cauchy [A.-L. Cauchy, Comptes
Rendus Math\'ematique 25, 536-538 (1847)] and Newton [I. Newton, The Method of
Fluxions and Infinite Series (Henry Woodfall, London, 1736)]. This work
introduces the Method of Infinite Descent, a semi-analytic optimisation
paradigm that reformulates training as the direct solution to the first-order
optimality condition. By analytical resummation of its Taylor expansion, this
method yields an exact, algebraic equation for the update step. Realisation of
the infinite Taylor tower's cascading resummation is formally derived, and an
exploitative algorithm for the direct solve step is proposed.
  This principle is demonstrated with the herein-introduced AION (Analytic,
Infinitely-Optimisable Network) architecture. AION is a model designed
expressly to satisfy the algebraic closure required by Infinite Descent. In a
simple test problem, AION reaches the optimum in a single descent step.
Together, this optimiser-model pair exemplify how analytic structure enables
exact, non-iterative convergence. Infinite Descent extends beyond this example,
applying to any appropriately closed architecture. This suggests a new class of

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了NorMuon优化器，结合正交化和神经元级自适应学习率，解决了Muon优化器中神经元更新不平衡的问题，在保持良好条件数的同时实现更均衡的参数优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon优化器通过正交化参数更新改善了优化几何条件，但缺乏与Adam自适应学习率的协同探索。研究发现Muon导致神经元更新范数高度不均匀，某些神经元主导优化过程。

Method: 提出NorMuon优化器，为每个神经元维护二阶动量统计，在正交化后应用行级归一化，确保平衡的参数利用。在FSDP2框架下开发了高效的分布式实现。

Result: 在多模型规模实验中，NorMuon始终优于Adam和Muon，在11亿参数预训练设置中比Adam训练效率提升21.74%，比Muon提升11.31%，同时保持与Muon相当的内存占用。

Conclusion: 正交化和自适应学习率是互补而非竞争的方法，为大尺度深度学习中的优化器设计开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The choice of optimizer significantly impacts the training efficiency and
computational costs of large language models (LLMs). Recently, the Muon
optimizer has demonstrated promising results by orthogonalizing parameter
updates, improving optimization geometry through better conditioning. Despite
Muon's emergence as a candidate successor to Adam, the potential for jointly
leveraging their strengths has not been systematically explored. In this work,
we bridge this gap by proposing NorMuon (Neuron-wise Normalized Muon), an
optimizer that synergistically combines orthogonalization with neuron-level
adaptive learning rates. Our analysis reveals that while Muon effectively
reduces condition numbers, the resulting updates exhibit highly non-uniform
neuron norms, causing certain neurons to dominate the optimization process.
NorMuon addresses this imbalance by maintaining second-order momentum
statistics for each neuron and applying row-wise normalization after
orthogonalization, ensuring balanced parameter utilization while preserving
Muon's conditioning benefits. To enable practical deployment at scale, we
develop an efficient distributed implementation under the FSDP2 framework that
strategically distributes orthogonalization computations across devices.
Experiments across multiple model scales demonstrate that NorMuon consistently
outperforms both Adam and Muon, achieving 21.74% better training efficiency
than Adam and 11.31% improvement over Muon on 1.1 B pretraining setting, while
maintaining a comparable memory footprint to Muon. Our findings suggest that
orthogonalization and adaptive learning rates are complementary rather than
competing approaches, opening new avenues for optimizer design in large-scale
deep learning.

Motivation: 医疗机器学习发展受限于心电图数据的隐私限制，现有生成方法存在形态保真度不足和无法生成个性化信号的问题。

Method: 基于条件扩散的结构化状态空间模型，引入MIDT-ECG训练范式（时频域监督）和多模态人口统计条件化。

Result: 在PTB-XL数据集上显著提升形态一致性，隐私保护指标比基线提高4-8%，导联间相关性误差平均减少74%，在低数据场景下达到与真实数据相当的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的时频结构正则化方案使ECG生成器能够作为个性化、高保真、隐私保护的替代品，推动生成式AI在医疗领域的负责任使用。

Abstract: The development of machine learning for cardiac care is severely hampered by
privacy restrictions on sharing real patient electrocardiogram (ECG) data.
Although generative AI offers a promising solution, the real-world use of
existing model-synthesized ECGs is limited by persistent gaps in
trustworthiness and clinical utility. In this work, we address two major
shortcomings of current generative ECG methods: insufficient morphological
fidelity and the inability to generate personalized, patient-specific
physiological signals. To address these gaps, we build on a conditional
diffusion-based Structured State Space Model (SSSD-ECG) with two principled
innovations: (1) MIDT-ECG (Mel-Spectrogram Informed Diffusion Training), a
novel training paradigm with time-frequency domain supervision to enforce
physiological structural realism, and (2) multi-modal demographic conditioning
to enable patient-specific synthesis. We comprehensively evaluate our approach
on the PTB-XL dataset, assessing the synthesized ECG signals on fidelity,
clinical coherence, privacy preservation, and downstream task utility. MIDT-ECG
achieves substantial gains: it improves morphological coherence, preserves
strong privacy guarantees with all metrics evaluated exceeding the baseline by
4-8%, and notably reduces the interlead correlation error by an average of 74%,
while demographic conditioning enhances signal-to-noise ratio and
personalization. In critical low-data regimes, a classifier trained on datasets
supplemented with our synthetic ECGs achieves performance comparable to a
classifier trained solely on real data. Together, we demonstrate that ECG
synthesizers, trained with the proposed time-frequency structural
regularization scheme, can serve as personalized, high-fidelity,
privacy-preserving surrogates when real data are scarce, advancing the
responsible use of generative AI in healthcare.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过电路复杂性视角分析了等变图神经网络在晶体结构预测中的计算和表达能力极限，证明在多项式精度下，这些模型可被多项式大小的均匀阈值电路家族模拟，属于TC^0复杂度类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管等变图神经网络在材料科学中表现出强大的经验性能，但其在周期性、对称性约束环境下的表达能力仍未被充分理解。本文旨在从计算复杂性角度系统分析这类模型的表达能力极限。

Method: 通过电路复杂性理论分析EGNN层的计算过程，包括节点特征、原子坐标和晶格矩阵的处理，证明在特定资源约束下（多项式精度、O(n)嵌入宽度、O(1)层数等），这些模型可被TC^0电路家族模拟。

Result: 证明了等变图神经网络在晶体结构预测中的计算能力上限为TC^0复杂度类，为理解这类模型的表达能力提供了理论依据。

Conclusion: 该分析为周期性晶体系统的对称感知图学习提供了复杂性理论基础，明确了需要哪些架构改进（如增加深度、更丰富的几何基元或更宽的层）才能超越TC^0的计算能力限制。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a core paradigm for learning on
relational data. In materials science, equivariant GNNs (EGNNs) have emerged as
a compelling backbone for crystalline-structure prediction, owing to their
ability to respect Euclidean symmetries and periodic boundary conditions.
Despite strong empirical performance, their expressive power in periodic,
symmetry-constrained settings remains poorly understood. This work
characterizes the intrinsic computational and expressive limits of EGNNs for
crystalline-structure prediction through a circuit-complexity lens. We analyze
the computations carried out by EGNN layers acting on node features, atomic
coordinates, and lattice matrices, and prove that, under polynomial precision,
embedding width $d=O(n)$ for $n$ nodes, $O(1)$ layers, and $O(1)$-depth,
$O(n)$-width MLP instantiations of the message/update/readout maps, these
models admit a simulation by a uniform $\mathsf{TC}^0$ threshold-circuit family
of polynomial size (with an explicit constant-depth bound). Situating EGNNs
within $\mathsf{TC}^0$ provides a concrete ceiling on the decision and
prediction problems solvable by such architectures under realistic resource
constraints and clarifies which architectural modifications (e.g., increased
depth, richer geometric primitives, or wider layers) are required to transcend
this regime. The analysis complements Weisfeiler-Lehman style results that do
not directly transfer to periodic crystals, and offers a complexity-theoretic
foundation for symmetry-aware graph learning on crystalline systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一种基于脑电图（EEG）的疼痛监测系统，使用机器学习模型分类高疼痛与低/无疼痛状态，在健康成年人激光诱发疼痛实验中达到88.9%的准确率，为临床疼痛评估提供了技术可行的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医院疼痛评估主要依赖患者自述或非特异性心电图生命体征，导致危重、镇静和认知障碍患者面临疼痛治疗不足或阿片类药物过度使用的风险。EEG技术可作为辅助工具检测伤害性处理过程，缓解这一问题。

Method: 使用52名健康成年人的EEG数据，暴露于三种强度（低、中、高）的激光诱发疼痛。将4秒时段的EEG转换为537个特征向量，包括谱功率、频带比、Hjorth参数、熵测量、相干性、小波能量和峰值频率指标。评估了9种传统机器学习模型，采用留一交叉验证。

Result: 支持向量机（径向基函数核）获得最佳离线性能，准确率达88.9%，推理时间小于1毫秒。特征重要性分析与经典疼痛生理学一致，显示对侧α抑制、中线θ/α增强和额叶γ爆发。实时XGBoost模型端到端延迟约4毫秒，准确率94.2%。

Conclusion: 基于EEG的疼痛监测器在临床环境中技术上可行，为临床验证提供了途径，有望改善危重和无法自述疼痛患者的疼痛管理。

Abstract: Current pain assessment within hospitals often relies on self-reporting or
non-specific EKG vital signs. This system leaves critically ill, sedated, and
cognitively impaired patients vulnerable to undertreated pain and opioid
overuse. Electroencephalography (EEG) offers a noninvasive method of measuring
brain activity. This technology could potentially be applied as an assistive
tool to highlight nociceptive processing in order to mitigate this issue. In
this study, we compared machine learning models for classifying high-pain
versus low/no-pain EEG epochs using data from fifty-two healthy adults exposed
to laser-evoked pain at three intensities (low, medium, high). Each four-second
epoch was transformed into a 537-feature vector spanning spectral power, band
ratios, Hjorth parameters, entropy measures, coherence, wavelet energies, and
peak-frequency metrics. Nine traditional machine learning models were evaluated
with leave-one-participant-out cross-validation. A support vector machine with
radial basis function kernel achieved the best offline performance with 88.9%
accuracy and sub-millisecond inference time (1.02 ms). Our Feature importance
analysis was consistent with current canonical pain physiology, showing
contralateral alpha suppression, midline theta/alpha enhancement, and frontal
gamma bursts. The real-time XGBoost model maintained an end-to-end latency of
about 4 ms and 94.2% accuracy, demonstrating that an EEG-based pain monitor is
technically feasible within a clinical setting and provides a pathway towards
clinical validation.

TL;DR: NeST-BO是一种针对高维贝叶斯优化的局部方法，通过高斯过程联合学习梯度和Hessian信息，并基于牛顿步误差的一步前瞻界来选择评估点，实现了在保持步长目标的同时降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贝叶斯优化在昂贵黑盒问题上有效，但在高维空间中面临挑战，需要解决计算复杂度和收敛速度的问题。

Method: 提出NeST-BO方法：使用高斯过程联合学习梯度和Hessian信息，通过一步前瞻界选择评估点，并在低维子空间中优化采集函数以降低计算成本。

Result: 在高维合成和真实世界问题中，NeST-BO相比现有方法实现了更快的收敛速度和更低的遗憾值，即使在数千变量和未知活跃子空间的情况下也表现良好。

Conclusion: NeST-BO通过结合牛顿步长目标和计算效率优化，为高维贝叶斯优化提供了一种有效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is effective for expensive black-box problems but
remains challenging in high dimensions. We propose NeST-BO, a local BO method
that targets the Newton step by jointly learning gradient and Hessian
information with Gaussian process surrogates, and selecting evaluations via a
one-step lookahead bound on Newton-step error. We show that this bound (and
hence the step error) contracts with batch size, so NeST-BO directly inherits
inexact-Newton convergence: global progress under mild stability assumptions
and quadratic local rates once steps are sufficiently accurate. To scale, we
optimize the acquisition in low-dimensional subspaces (e.g., random embeddings
or learned sparse subspaces), reducing the dominant cost of learning curvature
from $O(d^2)$ to $O(m^2)$ with $m \ll d$ while preserving step targeting.
Across high-dimensional synthetic and real-world problems, including cases with
thousands of variables and unknown active subspaces, NeST-BO consistently
yields faster convergence and lower regret than state-of-the-art local and
high-dimensional BO baselines.

Motivation: 现有的RLHF和DPO方法存在三个主要问题：偏好数据污染、奖励过优化和模型倾向于生成冗长回复。大多数现有工作只解决其中一个问题，且缺乏理论保证。

Method: 提出了RLHF-COV和DPO-COV算法，通过长度正则化同时缓解三个问题。DPO-COV无需奖励估计，实现简单，且证明与RLHF-COV等价。

Result: 理论分析表明DPO-COV在污染数据上获得了与干净数据下已知最佳速率匹配的泛化误差率。实验验证了算法在离线和在线设置中的有效性。

Conclusion: RLHF-COV和DPO-COV算法能同时解决RLHF/DPO训练中的三个关键问题，具有理论保证和实际有效性，且证明了原始RLHF与DPO算法的等价性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference
optimization (DPO) are important techniques to align large language models
(LLM) with human preference. However, the quality of RLHF and DPO training is
seriously compromised by \textit{\textbf{C}orrupted} preference, reward
\textit{\textbf{O}veroptimization}, and bias towards
\textit{\textbf{V}erbosity}. To our knowledge, most existing works tackle only
one of these important issues, and the few other works require much computation
to estimate multiple reward models and lack theoretical guarantee of
generalization ability. In this work, we propose RLHF-\textbf{COV} and
DPO-\textbf{COV} algorithms that can simultaneously mitigate these three
issues, in both offline and online settings. This ability is theoretically
demonstrated by obtaining length-regularized generalization error rates for our
DPO-COV algorithms trained on corrupted data, which match the best-known rates
for simpler cases with clean data and without length regularization. Moreover,
our DPO-COV algorithm is simple to implement without reward estimation, and is
proved to be equivalent to our RLHF-COV algorithm, which directly implies the
equivalence between the vanilla RLHF and DPO algorithms. Experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our DPO-COV algorithms under both offline and
online settings.

Conclusion: GTRANS框架有效解决了小图估计问题，通过迁移学习显著提升图函数估计精度和下游应用性能

Abstract: Graphon models provide a flexible nonparametric framework for estimating
latent connectivity probabilities in networks, enabling a range of downstream
applications such as link prediction and data augmentation. However, accurate
graphon estimation typically requires a large graph, whereas in practice, one
often only observes a small-sized network. One approach to addressing this
issue is to adopt a transfer learning framework, which aims to improve
estimation in a small target graph by leveraging structural information from a
larger, related source graph. In this paper, we propose a novel method, namely
GTRANS, a transfer learning framework that integrates neighborhood smoothing
and Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport to align and transfer structural
patterns between graphs. To prevent negative transfer, GTRANS includes an
adaptive debiasing mechanism that identifies and corrects for target-specific
deviations via residual smoothing. We provide theoretical guarantees on the
stability of the estimated alignment matrix and demonstrate the effectiveness
of GTRANS in improving the accuracy of target graph estimation through
extensive synthetic and real data experiments. These improvements translate
directly to enhanced performance in downstream applications, such as the graph
classification task and the link prediction task.

TL;DR: ARMOR是一种新颖的一次性后训练剪枝算法，通过矩阵分解将权重矩阵分解为2:4稀疏核心和两个低开销的块对角矩阵，在保持2:4剪枝推理加速和内存减少的同时，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型部署面临巨大计算和内存需求挑战，现有2:4稀疏剪枝方法通常会导致显著的性能下降，需要更好的剪枝方法来平衡模型压缩和任务准确性。

Method: ARMOR将每个权重矩阵分解为2:4稀疏核心和两个块对角矩阵包装器，这些包装器作为高效的前后变换误差校正器。通过块坐标下降算法选择稀疏核心和块对角包装器，最小化层间代理损失。

Result: 在Llama和Qwen模型系列上的实验表明，ARMOR在下游任务和困惑度评估中一致且显著优于最先进的2:4剪枝方法，同时保持推理加速和内存使用减少。

Conclusion: ARMOR在模型压缩和任务准确性之间建立了更有效的权衡，理论证明其优化保证收敛到代理损失小于或等于最先进剪枝算法的解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present significant deployment challenges due to
their immense computational and memory requirements. While semi-structured
pruning, particularly 2:4 sparsity, offers a path to practical hardware
acceleration, existing methods often incur substantial performance degradation.
To bridge this gap, we introduce ARMOR: (Adaptive Representation with
Matrix-factORization), a novel one-shot post-training pruning algorithm.
Instead of directly pruning weights, ARMOR factorizes each weight matrix into a
2:4 sparse core wrapped by two low-overhead, block diagonal matrices. These
wrappers act as efficient pre and post-transformation error correctors,
offering greater flexibility to preserve model quality compared to conventional
2:4 pruning techniques. The sparse core and block diagonal wrappers are chosen
through a block coordinate descent algorithm that minimizes a layer-wise proxy
loss. We theoretically prove this optimization is guaranteed to converge to a
solution with a proxy loss less than or equal to state-of-the-art pruning
algorithms. Experiments on Llama (Touvron et al., 2023; Dubey et al., 2024) and
Qwen (Yang et al., 2025) model families demonstrate that ARMOR consistently and
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art 2:4 pruning methods across a wide
range of downstream tasks and perplexity evaluations. ARMOR achieves this
superior performance while retaining the inference speedups and substantial
memory usage reductions of 2:4 pruning, establishing a more effective trade-off
between model compression and task accuracy

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LATTA是一种新的测试时自适应方法，通过噪声权重扰动和稳定权重锚点机制，在保持稳定性的同时有效适应分布偏移，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时自适应方法（如Tent）存在不稳定性和灾难性遗忘问题，特别是在小批量或复杂损坏情况下，这源于在复杂损失表面上过于确定性的更新。

Method: 提出LATTA方法，结合两种关键机制：(1) 受随机梯度Langevin动力学启发的噪声权重扰动，用于探索局部参数空间并逃离不良局部最小值；(2) 稳定权重锚点，防止模型偏离其鲁棒的源预训练。

Result: 在标准基准测试（Rotated-MNIST和CIFAR-10-C）上，LATTA显著优于Tent、CoTTA和EATA等现有方法，在CIFAR-10-C上将平均准确率提高超过2%，同时降低性能方差。

Conclusion: LATTA为自监督测试时自适应设定了新的最先进水平，无需架构更改或昂贵的蒙特卡洛传递，就能在保持稳定性的同时有效适应分布偏移。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to adapt a pretrained model to distribution
shifts using only unlabeled test data. While promising, existing methods like
Tent suffer from instability and can catastrophically forget the source
knowledge, especially with small batch sizes or challenging corruptions. We
argue that this arises from overly deterministic updates on a complex loss
surface. In this paper, we introduce Langevin-Anchored Test-Time Adaptation
(LATTA), a novel approach that regularizes adaptation through two key
mechanisms: (1) a noisy weight perturbation inspired by Stochastic Gradient
Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) to explore the local parameter space and escape poor
local minima, and (2) a stable weight anchor that prevents the model from
diverging from its robust source pre-training. This combination allows LATTA to
adapt effectively without sacrificing stability. Unlike prior Bayesian TTA
methods, LATTA requires no architectural changes or expensive Monte Carlo
passes. We conduct extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including
Rotated-MNIST and the more challenging CIFAR-10-C. Our results demonstrate that
LATTA significantly outperforms existing methods, including Tent, CoTTA, and
EATA, setting a new state of the art for self-supervised TTA by improving
average accuracy on CIFAR-10-C by over 2% while simultaneously reducing
performance variance.

Motivation: 现有特征选择方法难以捕捉复杂特征交互，且无法适应分布式场景中的数据不平衡、异构性和隐私限制。需要在不暴露敏感信息的情况下整合各客户端的特征选择知识。

Result: 大量实验验证了框架的有效性、鲁棒性和效率，在联邦学习场景中展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: FedCAPS框架成功解决了分布式特征选择中的隐私保护和数据异构性挑战，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Feature selection eliminates redundancy among features to improve downstream
task performance while reducing computational overhead. Existing methods often
struggle to capture intricate feature interactions and adapt across diverse
application scenarios. Recent advances employ generative intelligence to
alleviate these drawbacks. However, these methods remain constrained by
permutation sensitivity in embedding and reliance on convexity assumptions in
gradient-based search. To address these limitations, our initial work
introduces a novel framework that integrates permutation-invariant embedding
with policy-guided search. Although effective, it still left opportunities to
adapt to realistic distributed scenarios. In practice, data across local
clients is highly imbalanced, heterogeneous and constrained by strict privacy
regulations, limiting direct sharing. These challenges highlight the need for a
framework that can integrate feature selection knowledge across clients without
exposing sensitive information. In this extended journal version, we advance
the framework from two perspectives: 1) developing a privacy-preserving
knowledge fusion strategy to derive a unified representation space without
sharing sensitive raw data. 2) incorporating a sample-aware weighting strategy
to address distributional imbalance among heterogeneous local clients.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of
our framework. The results further demonstrate its strong generalization
ability in federated learning scenarios. The code and data are publicly

TL;DR: 论文分析了注意力机制在长上下文中的病理现象——注意力分数随上下文长度增加而趋于均匀化（rank-collapse），并通过理论分析证明了注意力缩放的必要性，发现临界缩放因子为β_n ∝ log n。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型处理更长上下文，注意力层出现根本性病理：注意力分数随上下文长度增加而崩溃为均匀分布，导致token过度聚类。虽然注意力缩放通过多对数因子β_n重新缩放注意力分数来有效解决这一问题，但该方法缺乏理论依据。

Method: 分析了一个简化但可处理的模型，该模型放大了注意力缩放的效果。在该模型中，注意力表现出由缩放因子β_n控制的相变：缩放不足会使所有token坍缩到单一方向，而过度缩放则使注意力退化为恒等变换，从而消除token间的有意义的交互。

Result: 主要结果确定了临界缩放β_n ∝ log n，并为YaRN和Qwen中的注意力缩放提供了严格的理论依据，阐明了为什么对数缩放能在长上下文中保持稀疏、内容自适应的注意力。

Conclusion: 研究为注意力缩放提供了理论支撑，证明了对数缩放因子是维持长上下文中有效注意力机制的关键，解决了注意力崩溃问题，同时避免了过度缩放导致的交互失效。

Abstract: As large language models scale to longer contexts, attention layers suffer
from a fundamental pathology: attention scores collapse toward uniformity as
context length $n$ increases, causing tokens to cluster excessively, a
phenomenon known as rank-collapse. While $\textit{attention scaling}$
effectively addresses this deficiency by rescaling attention scores with a
polylogarithmic factor $\beta_n$, theoretical justification for this approach
remains lacking.
  We analyze a simplified yet tractable model that magnifies the effect of
attention scaling. In this model, attention exhibits a phase transition
governed by the scaling factor $\beta_n$: insufficient scaling collapses all
tokens to a single direction, while excessive scaling reduces attention to
identity, thereby eliminating meaningful interactions between tokens. Our main
result identifies the critical scaling $\beta_n \asymp \log n$ and provides a
rigorous justification for attention scaling in YaRN and Qwen, clarifying why
logarithmic scaling maintains sparse, content-adaptive attention at large
context lengths.

Conclusion: GDGM框架能有效检测复杂的合谋欺骗行为，具有实际应用价值和优越性能。

Abstract: Spoofing detection in financial trading is crucial, especially for
identifying complex behaviors such as conspiracy spoofing. Traditional
machine-learning approaches primarily focus on isolated node features, often
overlooking the broader context of interconnected nodes. Graph-based
techniques, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have advanced the field
by leveraging relational information effectively. However, in real-world
spoofing detection datasets, trading behaviors exhibit dynamic, irregular
patterns. Existing spoofing detection methods, though effective in some
scenarios, struggle to capture the complexity of dynamic and diverse, evolving
inter-node relationships. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
framework called the Generative Dynamic Graph Model (GDGM), which models
dynamic trading behaviors and the relationships among nodes to learn
representations for conspiracy spoofing detection. Specifically, our approach
incorporates the generative dynamic latent space to capture the temporal
patterns and evolving market conditions. Raw trading data is first converted
into time-stamped sequences. Then we model trading behaviors using the neural
ordinary differential equations and gated recurrent units, to generate the
representation incorporating temporal dynamics of spoofing patterns.
Furthermore, pseudo-label generation and heterogeneous aggregation techniques
are employed to gather relevant information and enhance the detection
performance for conspiratorial spoofing behaviors. Experiments conducted on
spoofing detection datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art models in detection accuracy. Additionally, our spoofing
detection system has been successfully deployed in one of the largest global
trading markets, further validating the practical applicability and performance
of the proposed method.

Abstract: Graph simulation has recently received a surge of attention in graph
processing and analytics. In real-life applications, e.g. social science,
biology, and chemistry, many graphs are composed of a series of evolving graphs
(i.e., temporal graphs). While most of the existing graph generators focus on
static graphs, the temporal information of the graphs is ignored. In this
paper, we focus on simulating temporal graphs, which aim to reproduce the
structural and temporal properties of the observed real-life temporal graphs.
In this paper, we first give an overview of the existing temporal graph
generators, including recently emerged learning-based approaches. Most of these
learning-based methods suffer from one of the limitations: low efficiency in
training or slow generating, especially for temporal random walk-based methods.
Therefore, we propose an efficient learning-based approach to generate graph
snapshots, namely temporal graph autoencoder (TGAE). Specifically, we propose
an attention-based graph encoder to encode temporal and structural
characteristics on sampled ego-graphs. And we proposed an ego-graph decoder
that can achieve a good trade-off between simulation quality and efficiency in
temporal graph generation. Finally, the experimental evaluation is conducted
among our proposed TGAE and representative temporal graph generators on
real-life temporal graphs and synthesized graphs. It is reported that our
proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art temporal graph generators by
means of simulation quality and efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于嵌入共享的差分隐私协作学习方法，通过隐私编码网络和效用生成网络生成具有正式差分隐私保证的嵌入，只需一轮私有化通信且客户端计算量更少


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统协作学习基于模型权重共享，而基于嵌入共享的方法在资源效率上有优势，但现有差分隐私方法主要针对权重共享，缺乏针对嵌入共享的隐私保护机制

Method: 设计隐私编码网络和效用生成网络，生成具有差分隐私保证的嵌入，这些私有化嵌入可被服务器端各种模型（深度学习、随机森林或XGBoost）处理

Result: 该方法只需一轮私有化通信，客户端计算量少于传统方法，生成的私有化嵌入与服务器端模型类型无关

Conclusion: 通过协作学习和隐私学习的协同设计，实现了高效且具有正式差分隐私保证的嵌入共享方法

Abstract: Traditional collaborative learning approaches are based on sharing of model
weights between clients and a server. However, there are advantages to resource
efficiency through schemes based on sharing of embeddings (activations) created
from the data. Several differentially private methods were developed for
sharing of weights while such mechanisms do not exist so far for sharing of
embeddings. We propose Ours to learn a privacy encoding network in conjunction
with a small utility generation network such that the final embeddings
generated from it are equipped with formal differential privacy guarantees.
These privatized embeddings are then shared with a more powerful server, that
learns a post-processing that results in a higher accuracy for machine learning
tasks. We show that our co-design of collaborative and private learning results
in requiring only one round of privatized communication and lesser compute on
the client than traditional methods. The privatized embeddings that we share
from the client are agnostic to the type of model (deep learning, random
forests or XGBoost) used on the server in order to process these activations to
complete a task.

*Jiashu Tao,Reza Shokri*

TL;DR: 提出InfoRMIA，一种基于信息论的成员推理攻击方法，在LLMs中量化隐私风险，并在序列级和令牌级分析信息泄漏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在几乎所有可用数据上训练，加剧了信息泄漏的隐私风险，需要更有效的隐私风险评估方法。

Method: 提出信息论框架的成员推理攻击InfoRMIA，并扩展到令牌级分析，定位具体被记忆的令牌。

Result: InfoRMIA在基准测试中持续优于现有最佳方法RMIA，计算效率更高，且令牌级分析能精确定位泄漏位置。

Conclusion: 令牌级成员推理为LLMs隐私研究提供新视角，可实现更精准的隐私缓解措施如精确遗忘。

Abstract: Machine learning models are known to leak sensitive information, as they
inevitably memorize (parts of) their training data. More alarmingly, large
language models (LLMs) are now trained on nearly all available data, which
amplifies the magnitude of information leakage and raises serious privacy
risks. Hence, it is more crucial than ever to quantify privacy risk before the
release of LLMs. The standard method to quantify privacy is via membership
inference attacks, where the state-of-the-art approach is the Robust Membership
Inference Attack (RMIA). In this paper, we present InfoRMIA, a principled
information-theoretic formulation of membership inference. Our method
consistently outperforms RMIA across benchmarks while also offering improved
computational efficiency.
  In the second part of the paper, we identify the limitations of treating
sequence-level membership inference as the gold standard for measuring leakage.
We propose a new perspective for studying membership and memorization in LLMs:
token-level signals and analyses. We show that a simple token-based InfoRMIA
can pinpoint which tokens are memorized within generated outputs, thereby
localizing leakage from the sequence level down to individual tokens, while
achieving stronger sequence-level inference power on LLMs. This new scope
rethinks privacy in LLMs and can lead to more targeted mitigation, such as
exact unlearning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个统一的基准测试框架，用于系统评估图神经网络中消息传递和全局注意力机制在原子尺度建模中的贡献，发现编码器增强的MPNN是稳健基线，而融合局部-全局模型在长程相互作用主导的属性中表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于不一致的实现、特征或超参数调优，目前尚不清楚全局注意力机制何时能真正优于经过良好调优的MPNN层，需要建立受控的基准测试框架来系统评估这些架构组件的贡献。

Method: 基于HydraGNN构建统一、可复现的基准测试框架，支持在四个受控模型类之间无缝切换：MPNN、带化学/拓扑编码器的MPNN、MPNN与全局注意力的GPS风格混合模型，以及带编码器的完全融合局部-全局模型。使用七个不同的开源数据集进行回归和分类任务基准测试。

Result: 研究表明编码器增强的MPNN构成了稳健的基线，而融合局部-全局模型在由长程相互作用效应主导的属性中产生了最明显的优势。同时量化了注意力的精度-计算权衡，报告了其内存开销。

Conclusion: 这项研究建立了原子图学习中全局注意力的首次受控评估，并为未来模型开发提供了可复现的测试平台，明确了不同架构组件在不同物理场景下的适用性。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used as surrogates for costly
experiments and first-principles simulations to study the behavior of compounds
at atomistic scale, and their architectural complexity is constantly increasing
to enable the modeling of complex physics. While most recent GNNs combine more
traditional message passing neural networks (MPNNs) layers to model short-range
interactions with more advanced graph transformers (GTs) with global attention
mechanisms to model long-range interactions, it is still unclear when global
attention mechanisms provide real benefits over well-tuned MPNN layers due to
inconsistent implementations, features, or hyperparameter tuning. We introduce
the first unified, reproducible benchmarking framework - built on HydraGNN -
that enables seamless switching among four controlled model classes: MPNN, MPNN
with chemistry/topology encoders, GPS-style hybrids of MPNN with global
attention, and fully fused local - global models with encoders. Using seven
diverse open-source datasets for benchmarking across regression and
classification tasks, we systematically isolate the contributions of message
passing, global attention, and encoder-based feature augmentation. Our study
shows that encoder-augmented MPNNs form a robust baseline, while fused
local-global models yield the clearest benefits for properties governed by
long-range interaction effects. We further quantify the accuracy - compute
trade-offs of attention, reporting its overhead in memory. Together, these
results establish the first controlled evaluation of global attention in
atomistic graph learning and provide a reproducible testbed for future model
development.

Motivation: 移动设备产生大量时间序列数据，需要在不违反数据保护法规的情况下，将预训练模型从充足源时间序列适配到稀疏目标时间序列领域。

Method: 提出TimePD框架，包含三个关键组件：1）双分支不变解耦特征学习；2）轻量级参数自由代理去噪；3）双向知识蒸馏。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，TimePD平均优于最先进基线方法9.3%。

Conclusion: TimePD成功解决了源自由时间序列预测问题，在保护数据隐私的同时实现了有效的领域自适应。

Abstract: The proliferation of mobile devices generates a massive volume of time series
across various domains, where effective time series forecasting enables a
variety of real-world applications. This study focuses on a new problem of
source-free domain adaptation for time series forecasting. It aims to adapt a
pretrained model from sufficient source time series to the sparse target time
series domain without access to the source data, embracing data protection
regulations. To achieve this, we propose TimePD, the first source-free time
series forecasting framework with proxy denoising, where large language models
(LLMs) are employed to benefit from their generalization capabilities.
Specifically, TimePD consists of three key components: (1) dual-branch
invariant disentangled feature learning that enforces representation- and
gradient-wise invariance by means of season-trend decomposition; (2)
lightweight, parameter-free proxy denoising that dynamically calibrates
systematic biases of LLMs; and (3) knowledge distillation that bidirectionally
aligns the denoised prediction and the original target prediction. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets offer insight into the effectiveness of the
proposed TimePD, outperforming SOTA baselines by 9.3% on average.

Motivation: 研究深度学习中的根本可预测性限制，理解神经网络训练结果不可复现性的根源。

Method: 通过分析深度学习广泛观察到的特征，包括混沌学习动态和对称性诱导的不变子空间，推导出产生复杂吸引盆的充分条件。

Result: 发现深度学习吸引盆具有无限精细的分形结构，不确定性指数接近零，导致训练结果难以预测和复现。

Conclusion: 复杂吸引盆结构为深度学习施加了根本的可预测性限制，这对优化和AI安全部署具有重要意义。

Abstract: Fundamental limits to predictability are central to our understanding of many
physical and computational systems. Here we show that, despite its remarkable
capabilities, deep learning exhibits such fundamental limits rooted in the
fractal, riddled geometry of its basins of attraction: any initialization that
leads to one solution lies arbitrarily close to another that leads to a
different one. We derive sufficient conditions for the emergence of riddled
basins by analytically linking features widely observed in deep learning,
including chaotic learning dynamics and symmetry-induced invariant subspaces,
to reveal a general route to riddling in realistic deep networks. The resulting
basins of attraction possess an infinitely fine-scale fractal structure
characterized by an uncertainty exponent near zero, so that even large
increases in the precision of initial conditions yield only marginal gains in
outcome predictability. Riddling thus imposes a fundamental limit on the
predictability and hence reproducibility of neural network training, providing
a unified account of many empirical observations. These results reveal a
general organizing principle of deep learning with important implications for
optimization and the safe deployment of artificial intelligence.

TL;DR: MCNO提出了一种基于蒙特卡罗方法的神经算子框架，用于学习一维偏微分方程的解算子，无需假设平移不变核，通过可学习张量表示核函数，在任意网格分辨率上实现泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统傅里叶神经算子(FNO)依赖于谱表示和假设平移不变核，限制了其应用范围。MCNO旨在提供一种不依赖这些假设的替代方法，探索蒙特卡罗积分在神经算子框架中的应用。

Method: 将核函数表示为采样输入-输出对上的可学习张量，采用蒙特卡罗方法近似积分算子，采样一次后无需重复采样，通过插值步骤在不同网格间映射。

Result: 在标准1D PDE基准测试中，MCNO以高效计算成本实现了竞争性精度，理论分析证明蒙特卡罗估计器在温和正则性假设下具有有界偏差和方差。

Conclusion: MCNO为连续域PDE提供了理论支持的替代方法，可自然扩展到高维问题，为蒙特卡罗型积分在神经算子框架中的应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The Monte Carlo-type Neural Operator (MCNO) introduces a framework for
learning solution operators of one-dimensional partial differential equations
(PDEs) by directly learning the kernel function and approximating the
associated integral operator using a Monte Carlo-type approach. Unlike Fourier
Neural Operators (FNOs), which rely on spectral representations and assume
translation-invariant kernels, MCNO makes no such assumptions. The kernel is
represented as a learnable tensor over sampled input-output pairs, and sampling
is performed once, uniformly at random from a discretized grid. This design
enables generalization across multiple grid resolutions without relying on
fixed global basis functions or repeated sampling during training, while an
interpolation step maps between arbitrary input and output grids to further
enhance flexibility. Experiments on standard 1D PDE benchmarks show that MCNO
achieves competitive accuracy with efficient computational cost. We also
provide a theoretical analysis proving that the Monte Carlo estimator yields a
bounded bias and variance under mild regularity assumptions. This result holds
in any spatial dimension, suggesting that MCNO may extend naturally beyond
one-dimensional problems. More broadly, this work explores how Monte Carlo-type
integration can be incorporated into neural operator frameworks for
continuous-domain PDEs, providing a theoretically supported alternative to
spectral methods (such as FNO) and to graph-based Monte Carlo approaches (such
as the Graph Kernel Neural Operator, GNO).

TL;DR: NEO是一种超参数免费、计算成本极低的测试时自适应方法，通过重新中心化目标数据嵌入到原点来改善源域与分布偏移样本的对齐，在多个数据集上优于现有TTA方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时自适应方法通常计算昂贵、需要大量数据或对超参数敏感，因此需要开发更高效、稳健的TTA方法。

Method: 基于潜在空间几何理论，将目标数据嵌入重新中心化到原点来改善源域与分布偏移样本的对齐，这是一种超参数免费的方法。

Result: 在ImageNet-C上，ViT-Base准确率从55.6%提升到59.2%；在多个数据集上优于7种TTA方法中的6-7种，同时减少63%推理时间和9%内存使用。

Conclusion: NEO是一种高效有效的测试时自适应方法，适用于资源受限设备，能够显著提升模型在分布偏移下的性能。

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods are often computationally expensive,
require a large amount of data for effective adaptation, or are brittle to
hyperparameters. Based on a theoretical foundation of the geometry of the
latent space, we are able to significantly improve the alignment between source
and distribution-shifted samples by re-centering target data embeddings at the
origin. This insight motivates NEO -- a hyperparameter-free fully TTA method,
that adds no significant compute compared to vanilla inference. NEO is able to
improve the classification accuracy of ViT-Base on ImageNet-C from 55.6% to
59.2% after adapting on just one batch of 64 samples. When adapting on 512
samples NEO beats all 7 TTA methods we compare against on ImageNet-C,
ImageNet-R and ImageNet-S and beats 6/7 on CIFAR-10-C, while using the least
amount of compute. NEO performs well on model calibration metrics and
additionally is able to adapt from 1 class to improve accuracy on 999 other
classes in ImageNet-C. On Raspberry Pi and Jetson Orin Nano devices, NEO
reduces inference time by 63% and memory usage by 9% compared to baselines. Our
results based on 3 ViT architectures and 4 datasets show that NEO can be used
efficiently and effectively for TTA.

*David Debot,Giuseppe Marra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Sidechannel Independence Score (SIS) 指标和正则化方法，用于量化并控制概念侧信道模型在准确性和可解释性之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 概念瓶颈模型(CBNMs)虽然提供可解释性，但限制了信息流导致准确性下降；概念侧信道模型(CSMs)通过侧信道提高准确性，但牺牲了可解释性。目前缺乏控制这种权衡的原则性方法。

Method: 提出了统一的概率概念侧信道元模型，引入SIS指标量化模型对侧信道的依赖程度，并提出SIS正则化来显式惩罚侧信道依赖以提升可解释性。

Result: 实验结果显示，仅追求准确性的最先进CSMs表现出较低的表征可解释性，而SIS正则化显著改善了可解释性、可干预性以及学习到的可解释任务预测器的质量。

Conclusion: 该工作为开发在准确性和可解释性之间取得平衡的CSMs提供了理论和实践工具。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBNMs) are deep learning models that provide
interpretability by enforcing a bottleneck layer where predictions are based
exclusively on human-understandable concepts. However, this constraint also
restricts information flow and often results in reduced predictive accuracy.
Concept Sidechannel Models (CSMs) address this limitation by introducing a
sidechannel that bypasses the bottleneck and carry additional task-relevant
information. While this improves accuracy, it simultaneously compromises
interpretability, as predictions may rely on uninterpretable representations
transmitted through sidechannels. Currently, there exists no principled
technique to control this fundamental trade-off. In this paper, we close this
gap. First, we present a unified probabilistic concept sidechannel meta-model
that subsumes existing CSMs as special cases. Building on this framework, we
introduce the Sidechannel Independence Score (SIS), a metric that quantifies a
CSM's reliance on its sidechannel by contrasting predictions made with and
without sidechannel information. We propose SIS regularization, which
explicitly penalizes sidechannel reliance to improve interpretability. Finally,
we analyze how the expressivity of the predictor and the reliance of the
sidechannel jointly shape interpretability, revealing inherent trade-offs
across different CSM architectures. Empirical results show that
state-of-the-art CSMs, when trained solely for accuracy, exhibit low
representation interpretability, and that SIS regularization substantially
improves their interpretability, intervenability, and the quality of learned
interpretable task predictors. Our work provides both theoretical and practical
tools for developing CSMs that balance accuracy and interpretability in a
principled manner.

Result: 在模拟随机图实验中与流行的图神经网络方法竞争，在开源和真实专有数据集的保险欺诈检测中表现出强大性能。

Conclusion: G-GBM为异构动态图上的监督学习提供了有效的解决方案，特别适用于保险欺诈检测等类别不平衡问题，同时保持了梯度提升方法的可解释性优势。

Abstract: Graph-based methods are becoming increasingly popular in machine learning due
to their ability to model complex data and relations. Insurance fraud is a
prime use case, since false claims are often the result of organised criminals
that stage accidents or the same persons filing erroneous claims on multiple
policies. One challenge is that graph-based approaches struggle to find
meaningful representations of the data because of the high class imbalance
present in fraud data. Another is that insurance networks are heterogeneous and
dynamic, given the changing relations among people, companies and policies.
That is why gradient boosted tree approaches on tabular data still dominate the
field. Therefore, we present a novel inductive graph gradient boosting machine
(G-GBM) for supervised learning on heterogeneous and dynamic graphs. We show
that our estimator competes with popular graph neural network approaches in an
experiment using a variety of simulated random graphs. We demonstrate the power
of G-GBM for insurance fraud detection using an open-source and a real-world,
proprietary dataset. Given that the backbone model is a gradient boosting
forest, we apply established explainability methods to gain better insights
into the predictions made by G-GBM.

Conclusion: 建立了一个原则性的、不确定性感知的、结构敏感的方法来解释量子图神经网络，为扩展到更广泛架构和真实数据集奠定了基础。

Abstract: Quantum graph neural networks offer a powerful paradigm for learning on
graph-structured data, yet their explainability is complicated by
measurement-induced stochasticity and the combinatorial nature of graph
structure. In this paper, we introduce QuantumGraphLIME (QGraphLIME), a
model-agnostic, post-hoc framework that treats model explanations as
distributions over local surrogates fit on structure-preserving perturbations
of a graph. By aggregating surrogate attributions together with their
dispersion, QGraphLIME yields uncertainty-aware node and edge importance
rankings for quantum graph models. The framework further provides a
distribution-free, finite-sample guarantee on the size of the surrogate
ensemble: a Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz bound ensures uniform approximation of
the induced distribution of a binary class probability at target accuracy and
confidence under standard independence assumptions. Empirical studies on
controlled synthetic graphs with known ground truth demonstrate accurate and
stable explanations, with ablations showing clear benefits of nonlinear
surrogate modeling and highlighting sensitivity to perturbation design.
Collectively, these results establish a principled, uncertainty-aware, and
structure-sensitive approach to explaining quantum graph neural networks, and
lay the groundwork for scaling to broader architectures and real-world
datasets, as quantum resources mature. Code is available at

TL;DR: vAttention是一种结合top-k和随机采样的稀疏注意力机制，提供用户指定的(ε, δ)精度保证，在保持高质量的同时实现高达20倍的稀疏度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的稀疏注意力方法（top-k和采样）存在根本性限制：无法提供跨头和查询向量的一致近似，且缺乏近似质量保证，限制了实际部署。

Method: 结合top-k和随机采样的互补优势：top-k在注意力分数由少数token主导时表现良好，而随机采样在注意力分数相对均匀时提供更好估计，并利用采样的统计保证。

Result: vAttention显著提升稀疏注意力质量（Llama-3.1-8B-Inst和Deepseek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B在RULER-HARD上提升约4.5个百分点），在推理场景中实现快速解码而不影响模型质量。

Conclusion: vAttention是第一个具有用户指定精度保证的实用稀疏注意力机制，有效弥合了完整注意力和稀疏注意力之间的差距，支持大规模可靠部署。

Abstract: State-of-the-art sparse attention methods for reducing decoding latency fall
into two main categories: approximate top-$k$ (and its extension, top-$p$) and
recently introduced sampling-based estimation. However, these approaches are
fundamentally limited in their ability to approximate full attention: they fail
to provide consistent approximations across heads and query vectors and, most
critically, lack guarantees on approximation quality, limiting their practical
deployment. We observe that top-$k$ and random sampling are complementary:
top-$k$ performs well when attention scores are dominated by a few tokens,
whereas random sampling provides better estimates when attention scores are
relatively uniform. Building on this insight and leveraging the statistical
guarantees of sampling, we introduce vAttention, the first practical sparse
attention mechanism with user-specified $(\epsilon, \delta)$ guarantees on
approximation accuracy (thus, verified). These guarantees make vAttention a
compelling step toward practical, reliable deployment of sparse attention at
scale. By unifying top-k and sampling, vAttention outperforms both
individually, delivering a superior quality-efficiency trade-off. Our
experiments show that vAttention significantly improves the quality of sparse
attention (e.g., $\sim$4.5 percentage points for Llama-3.1-8B-Inst and
Deepseek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B on RULER-HARD), and effectively bridges the gap
between full and sparse attention (e.g., across datasets, it matches full model
quality with upto 20x sparsity). We also demonstrate that it can be deployed in
reasoning scenarios to achieve fast decoding without compromising model quality
(e.g., vAttention achieves full model quality on AIME2024 at 10x sparsity with
up to 32K token generations). Code is open-sourced at

Conclusion: 提出的原始对偶DPO方法为LLM的约束对齐问题提供了有效的解决方案，具有理论保证和实际应用价值。

Abstract: The widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) imposes increasing
demands on safety, such as reducing harmful content and fake information, and
avoiding certain forbidden tokens due to rules and laws. While there have been
several recent works studying safe alignment of LLMs, these works either
require the training of reward and cost models and incur high memory and
computational costs, or need prior knowledge about the optimal solution.
Motivated by this fact, we study the problem of constrained alignment in LLMs,
i.e., maximizing the output reward while restricting the cost due to
potentially unsafe content to stay below a threshold. For this problem, we
propose a novel primal-dual DPO approach, which first trains a model using
standard DPO on reward preference data to provide reward information, and then
adopts a rearranged Lagrangian DPO objective utilizing the provided reward
information to fine-tune LLMs on cost preference data. Our approach
significantly reduces memory and computational costs, and does not require
extra prior knowledge. Moreover, we establish rigorous theoretical guarantees
on the suboptimality and constraint violation of the output policy. We also
extend our approach to an online data setting by incorporating exploration
bonuses, which enables our approach to explore uncovered prompt-response space,
and then provide theoretical results that get rid of the dependence on
preference data coverage. Experimental results on the widely-used preference
dataset PKU-SafeRLHF demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Unsupervised representation learning, particularly sequential
disentanglement, aims to separate static and dynamic factors of variation in
data without relying on labels. This remains a challenging problem, as existing
approaches based on variational autoencoders and generative adversarial
networks often rely on multiple loss terms, complicating the optimization
process. Furthermore, sequential disentanglement methods face challenges when
applied to real-world data, and there is currently no established evaluation
protocol for assessing their performance in such settings. Recently, diffusion
models have emerged as state-of-the-art generative models, but no theoretical
formalization exists for their application to sequential disentanglement. In
this work, we introduce the Diffusion Sequential Disentanglement Autoencoder
(DiffSDA), a novel, modal-agnostic framework effective across diverse
real-world data modalities, including time series, video, and audio. DiffSDA
leverages a new probabilistic modeling, latent diffusion, and efficient
samplers, while incorporating a challenging evaluation protocol for rigorous
testing. Our experiments on diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that
DiffSDA outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in sequential
disentanglement.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于潜在模式挖掘的邻域自适应广义线性图嵌入模型(NGLGE)，通过自适应图学习和低秩表示重构，解决了传统方法需要预定义邻域大小和单一模式挖掘的局限性。


<details>

Result: 在多个不同场景的数据集上进行比较评估，证明该模型相比最先进方法具有优越性能。

Conclusion: NGLGE模型通过自适应图学习和灵活的模式挖掘机制，有效提升了图嵌入方法在不同场景下的适应性和性能表现。

Abstract: Graph embedding has been widely applied in areas such as network analysis,
social network mining, recommendation systems, and bioinformatics. However,
current graph construction methods often require the prior definition of
neighborhood size, limiting the effective revelation of potential structural
correlations in the data. Additionally, graph embedding methods using linear
projection heavily rely on a singular pattern mining approach, resulting in
relative weaknesses in adapting to different scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel model, Neighborhood-Adaptive Generalized Linear
Graph Embedding (NGLGE), grounded in latent pattern mining. This model
introduces an adaptive graph learning method tailored to the neighborhood,
effectively revealing intrinsic data correlations. Simultaneously, leveraging a
reconstructed low-rank representation and imposing $\ell_{2,0}$ norm constraint
on the projection matrix allows for flexible exploration of additional pattern
information. Besides, an efficient iterative solving algorithm is derived for
the proposed model. Comparative evaluations on datasets from diverse scenarios
demonstrate the superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art
methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种学习型调度器来替代掩码扩散模型中的启发式调度策略，通过将去噪过程建模为KL正则化的马尔可夫决策过程，优化生成顺序以更好地匹配数据分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 掩码扩散模型在语言建模中性能高度依赖于选择哪个位置进行解掩码的顺序，而现有的基于规则的调度方法（如最大置信度、最大边界）只能提供临时改进，需要更智能的调度策略。

Method: 将去噪过程建模为KL正则化的马尔可夫决策过程，具有明确的参考策略，优化一个允许策略改进和收敛保证的正则化目标函数。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，学习到的策略始终优于最大置信度方法：在SUDOKU任务上，相比随机调度获得20.1%的提升，相比最大置信度获得11.2%的提升。

Conclusion: 通过学习的调度策略，掩码扩散模型能够生成更接近数据分布的样本，证明了学习型调度器优于传统启发式方法的有效性。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have recently emerged as a novel framework for
language modeling. MDMs generate sentences by iteratively denoising masked
sequences, filling in [MASK] tokens step by step. Although MDMs support
any-order sampling, performance is highly sensitive to the choice of which
position to unmask next. Prior work typically relies on rule-based schedules
(e.g., max-confidence, max-margin), which provide ad hoc improvements. In
contrast, we replace these heuristics with a learned scheduler. Specifically,
we cast denoising as a KL-regularized Markov decision process (MDP) with an
explicit reference policy and optimize a regularized objective that admits
policy improvement and convergence guarantees under standard assumptions. We
prove that the optimized policy under this framework generates samples that
more closely match the data distribution than heuristic schedules. Empirically,
across four benchmarks, our learned policy consistently outperforms
max-confidence: for example, on SUDOKU, where unmasking order is critical, it
yields a 20.1% gain over random and a 11.2% gain over max-confidence.

Motivation: 研究多智能体LLM系统中的合作诱导方法，探索通信和课程学习两种途径在协调问题中的效果。

Method: 在4人猎鹿游戏中测试单词"廉价交谈"通信通道，在迭代公共物品惩罚游戏中实施渐进复杂游戏的课程学习。

Result: 通信显著提升合作率（0%→48.3%），而课程学习导致收益下降27.4%，并可能引发"习得性悲观"。

Conclusion: 对于协调问题，简单通信协议比基于经验的训练更可靠；社会困境的课程设计需要仔细考虑游戏序列中嵌入的战略教训。

Abstract: Eliciting cooperation in multi-agent LLM systems is critical for AI
alignment. We investigate two approaches: direct communication and curriculum
learning. In a 4-player Stag Hunt, a one-word "cheap talk" channel increases
cooperation from 0% to 48.3%, demonstrating communication as a robust
coordination mechanism. In contrast, we find that curriculum learning is highly
sensitive to design choices: our pedagogical curriculum through progressively
complex games reduced agent payoffs by 27.4% in an Iterated Public Goods Game
with Punishment. Qualitative analysis reveals that curricula emphasizing
defection-equilibrium games can induce "learned pessimism" in agents. These
findings suggest that for coordination problems, simple communication protocols
may be more reliable than experience-based training, and that curriculum design
for social dilemmas requires careful attention to the strategic lessons
embedded in game sequences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究大多隐含假设HGNNs的有效性而未经验证，需要系统检验HGNNs是否真正有效以及性能提升的来源

Method: 在21个数据集和20个基线模型上进行系统性复现和超参数调优，开发因果效应估计框架，通过事实和反事实分析评估候选因素，并使用最小充分调整集、跨方法一致性检验和敏感性分析验证鲁棒性

Result: 模型架构和复杂度对性能没有因果影响；异构信息通过增加同质性和局部-全局分布差异产生正向因果效应，使节点类别更易区分

Conclusion: HGNNs的性能提升主要来自异构信息而非模型架构本身，这为未来研究提供了重要启示

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in node
classification. Building on this progress, heterogeneous graph neural networks
(HGNNs) integrate relation types and node and edge semantics to leverage
heterogeneous information. Causal analysis for HGNNs is advancing rapidly,
aiming to separate genuine causal effects from spurious correlations. However,
whether HGNNs are intrinsically effective remains underexamined, and most
studies implicitly assume rather than establish this effectiveness. In this
work, we examine HGNNs from two perspectives: model architecture and
heterogeneous information. We conduct a systematic reproduction across 21
datasets and 20 baselines, complemented by comprehensive hyperparameter
retuning. To further disentangle the source of performance gains, we develop a
causal effect estimation framework that constructs and evaluates candidate
factors under standard assumptions through factual and counterfactual analyses,
with robustness validated via minimal sufficient adjustment sets, cross-method
consistency checks, and sensitivity analyses. Our results lead to two
conclusions. First, model architecture and complexity have no causal effect on
performance. Second, heterogeneous information exerts a positive causal effect
by increasing homophily and local-global distribution discrepancy, which makes
node classes more distinguishable. The implementation is publicly available at
https://github.com/YXNTU/CausalHGNN.

TL;DR: 本文比较了迁移学习场景下多种成员推理攻击(MIA)的性能，发现没有单一MIA能捕捉所有隐私风险，LiRA在多数情况下表现最佳，而IHA在PatchCamelyon数据集的高数据量场景中更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大规模基础模型的出现，训练范式从零开始训练转向迁移学习，这使得在敏感应用中使用小规模领域特定数据集进行高效训练成为可能。需要评估迁移学习场景下的隐私泄露风险。

Method: 比较了多种成员推理攻击(MIA)在迁移学习设置中的性能，包括基于分数的MIA、似然比攻击(LiRA)和逆海森攻击(IHA)，以帮助从业者识别最有效的隐私风险评估攻击方法。

Result: 攻击效能随着训练数据量的增加而降低；没有单一MIA能捕捉迁移学习模型中的所有隐私风险；LiRA在大多数实验场景中表现最优，而IHA在PatchCamelyon数据集的高数据量场景中更有效。

Conclusion: 迁移学习场景下的隐私风险评估需要多种攻击方法的组合，LiRA是通用性最强的攻击方法，但在特定场景下IHA可能更有效。

Abstract: With the emergence of powerful large-scale foundation models, the training
paradigm is increasingly shifting from from-scratch training to transfer
learning. This enables high utility training with small, domain-specific
datasets typical in sensitive applications.Membership inference attacks (MIAs)
provide an empirical estimate of the privacy leakage by machine learning
models. Yet, prior assessments of MIAs against models fine-tuned with transfer
learning rely on a small subset of possible attacks. We address this by
comparing performance of diverse MIAs in transfer learning settings to help
practitioners identify the most efficient attacks for privacy risk evaluation.
We find that attack efficacy decreases with the increase in training data for
score-based MIAs. We find that there is no one MIA which captures all privacy
risks in models trained with transfer learning. While the Likelihood Ratio
Attack (LiRA) demonstrates superior performance across most experimental
scenarios, the Inverse Hessian Attack (IHA) proves to be more effective against
models fine-tuned on PatchCamelyon dataset in high data regime.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用时间非齐次隐马尔可夫模型(TIHMMs)生成合成SNP序列数据集的隐私保护框架，通过限制每个SNP序列在训练中的影响来提供差分隐私保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNP数据集对遗传学研究至关重要，但共享时存在严重隐私风险，现有方法要么对统计摘要应用差分隐私，要么需要复杂的后处理和使用公开数据集。

Method: 使用时间非齐次隐马尔可夫模型生成合成SNP序列数据集，通过限制每个SNP序列的梯度贡献来确保差分隐私，直接处理SNP之间的相关性带来的隐私风险。

Result: 在1000 Genomes数据集上的实验表明，在ε∈[1,10]、δ=10^{-4}的隐私预算下，该方法能有效生成合成数据集，通过使HMM的转移模型依赖于序列位置显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 该框架能够在保护隐私的同时共享基因组数据，为研究人员提供了出色的灵活性和实用性。

Abstract: Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) datasets are fundamental to genetic
studies but pose significant privacy risks when shared. The correlation of SNPs
with each other makes strong adversarial attacks such as masked-value
reconstruction, kin, and membership inference attacks possible. Existing
privacy-preserving approaches either apply differential privacy to statistical
summaries of these datasets or offer complex methods that require
post-processing and the usage of a publicly available dataset to suppress or
selectively share SNPs.
  In this study, we introduce an innovative framework for generating synthetic
SNP sequence datasets using samples derived from time-inhomogeneous hidden
Markov models (TIHMMs). To preserve the privacy of the training data, we ensure
that each SNP sequence contributes only a bounded influence during training,
enabling strong differential privacy guarantees. Crucially, by operating on
full SNP sequences and bounding their gradient contributions, our method
directly addresses the privacy risks introduced by their inherent correlations.
  Through experiments conducted on the real-world 1000 Genomes dataset, we
demonstrate the efficacy of our method using privacy budgets of $\varepsilon
\in [1, 10]$ at $\delta=10^{-4}$. Notably, by allowing the transition models of
the HMM to be dependent on the location in the sequence, we significantly
enhance performance, enabling the synthetic datasets to closely replicate the
statistical properties of non-private datasets. This framework facilitates the
private sharing of genomic data while offering researchers exceptional
flexibility and utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集压缩方法使用完整的随机梯度下降轨迹作为对齐目标，但这些轨迹通常噪声大、曲率高且存储密集，导致梯度不稳定、收敛慢和内存开销大。

Method: 用连接初始和最终模型状态的二次贝塞尔曲线作为平滑、低损失的参数化替代路径，替代完整的SGD轨迹，提供无噪声、低曲率的监督信号。

Result: 在五个临床数据集上优于最先进的压缩方法，生成的压缩数据集能够支持临床有效模型的开发。

Conclusion: 贝塞尔模式连接作为SGD路径的有效替代，能够稳定梯度、加速收敛并消除密集轨迹存储需求，在临床数据压缩中表现出色。

Abstract: Dataset condensation (DC) enables the creation of compact, privacy-preserving
synthetic datasets that can match the utility of real patient records,
supporting democratised access to highly regulated clinical data for developing
downstream clinical models. State-of-the-art DC methods supervise synthetic
data by aligning the training dynamics of models trained on real and those
trained on synthetic data, typically using full stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) trajectories as alignment targets; however, these trajectories are often
noisy, high-curvature, and storage-intensive, leading to unstable gradients,
slow convergence, and substantial memory overhead. We address these limitations
by replacing full SGD trajectories with smooth, low-loss parametric surrogates,
specifically quadratic B\'ezier curves that connect the initial and final model
states from real training trajectories. These mode-connected paths provide
noise-free, low-curvature supervision signals that stabilise gradients,
accelerate convergence, and eliminate the need for dense trajectory storage. We
theoretically justify B\'ezier-mode connections as effective surrogates for SGD
paths and empirically show that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art condensation approaches across five clinical datasets,
yielding condensed datasets that enable clinically effective model development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 粒子滤波在复杂数学推理任务中表现优异，但受过程奖励模型引导时容易过早收敛到局部最优解，导致粒子贫化问题，特别是在计算资源受限时更为严重。

Method: ePF算法包含两个新技术：Entropic Annealing通过监控搜索多样性来动态调整重采样分布，防止粒子贫化；Look-ahead Modulation通过评估状态的后续潜力来提供预测性指导。

Result: 在多个挑战性数学基准测试中，ePF显著优于强基线方法，任务奖励相对提升高达50%。

Conclusion: ePF通过平衡解空间的探索和高奖励区域的利用，提高了粒子滤波的鲁棒性，最终获得更高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Inference-Time Scaling (ITS) improves language models by allocating more
computation at generation time. Particle Filtering (PF) has emerged as a strong
ITS method for complex mathematical reasoning tasks, but it is vulnerable when
guided by process reward models, which often assign overconfident scores early
in the reasoning process. This causes PF to suffer from premature exploitation:
it myopically commits to locally promising trajectories, prunes potentially
correct hypotheses, and converges to suboptimal solutions. This failure mode,
known as particle impoverishment, is especially severe under constrained
computational budgets. To address this, we analyze the problem and identify two
root causes: a lack of diversity in the particle set due to overconfident
resampling and consequent inability to assess the potential of a reasoning
path. We introduce Entropic Particle Filtering (ePF), an algorithm that
integrates two new techniques to solve these issues. The first technique,
Entropic Annealing (EA), directly mitigates particle impoverishment by
monitoring search diversity via entropy; when diversity drops, it intervenes by
dynamically annealing the resampling distribution to preserve exploration. The
second, an enhancement called Look-ahead Modulation (LaM), adds a predictive
guide to evaluate a state's potential based on its successors. On several
challenging math benchmarks, ePF significantly outperforms strong baselines and
achieves up to a 50 % relative improvement in task reward. Together, these
methods improve PF's resilience by balancing the exploration of diverse
solution spaces with the exploitation of high-reward regions, ultimately
leading to higher-quality solutions.

Motivation: 传统方法将轨迹转换为固定长度表示，忽略了真实轨迹的固有可变性，导致信息丢失或特征冗余。

Method: 使用模态特定编码器和跨模态交互模块捕捉空间、时间和拓扑语义，动态轨迹建模机制自适应调节不同长度轨迹的信息密度，并采用对比对齐和掩码语言建模两种自监督预训练目标。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验表明，MDTI始终优于最先进的基线方法，证实了其鲁棒性和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: MDTI框架通过多模态轨迹表示学习有效提升了旅行时间估计的准确性。

Abstract: Accurate travel time estimation (TTE) plays a crucial role in intelligent
transportation systems. However, it remains challenging due to heterogeneous
data sources and complex traffic dynamics. Moreover, conventional approaches
typically convert trajectories into fixed-length representations, neglecting
the inherent variability of real-world trajectories, which often leads to
information loss or feature redundancy. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces the Multimodal Dynamic Trajectory Integration (MDTI) framework--a
novel multimodal trajectory representation learning approach that integrates
GPS sequences, grid trajectories, and road network constraints to enhance TTE
accuracy. MDTI employs modality-specific encoders and a cross-modal interaction
module to capture complementary spatial, temporal, and topological semantics,
while a dynamic trajectory modeling mechanism adaptively regulates information
density for trajectories of varying lengths. Two self-supervised pretraining
objectives, named contrastive alignment and masked language modeling, further
strengthen multimodal consistency and contextual understanding. Extensive
experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that MDTI consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, confirming its robustness and strong
generalization abilities. The code is publicly available at:

Abstract: Guiding pretrained flow-based generative models for conditional generation or

without retraining on paired data. We present ESS-Flow, a gradient-free method
that leverages the typically Gaussian prior of the source distribution in
flow-based models to perform Bayesian inference directly in the source space
using Elliptical Slice Sampling. ESS-Flow only requires forward passes through
the generative model and observation process, no gradient or Jacobian
computations, and is applicable even when gradients are unreliable or
unavailable, such as with simulation-based observations or quantization in the
generation or observation process. We demonstrate its effectiveness on
designing materials with desired target properties and predicting protein
structures from sparse inter-residue distance measurements.

Abstract: This paper studies forecasting of the future distribution of events in human
action sequences, a task essential in domains like retail, finance, healthcare,
and recommendation systems where the precise temporal order is often less
critical than the set of outcomes. We challenge the dominant autoregressive
paradigm and investigate whether explicitly modeling the future distribution or
order-invariant multi-token approaches outperform order-preserving methods. We
analyze local order invariance and introduce a KL-based metric to quantify
temporal drift. We find that a simple explicit distribution forecasting
objective consistently surpasses complex implicit baselines. We further
demonstrate that mode collapse of predicted categories is primarily driven by
distributional imbalance. This work provides a principled framework for
selecting modeling strategies and offers practical guidance for building more
accurate and robust forecasting systems.

Abstract: Accurately simulating physics is crucial across scientific domains, with
applications spanning from robotics to materials science. While traditional
mesh-based simulations are precise, they are often computationally expensive
and require knowledge of physical parameters, such as material properties. In
contrast, data-driven approaches like Graph Network Simulators (GNSs) offer
faster inference but suffer from two key limitations: Firstly, they must be
retrained from scratch for even minor variations in physical parameters, and
secondly they require labor-intensive data collection for each new parameter
setting. This is inefficient, as simulations with varying parameters often
share a common underlying latent structure. In this work, we address these
challenges by learning this shared structure through meta-learning, enabling
fast adaptation to new physical parameters without retraining. To this end, we
propose a novel architecture that generates a latent representation by encoding
graph trajectories using conditional neural processes (CNPs). To mitigate error
accumulation over time, we combine CNPs with a novel neural operator
architecture. We validate our approach, Meta Neural Graph Operator (MaNGO), on
several dynamics prediction tasks with varying material properties,
demonstrating superior performance over existing GNS methods. Notably, MaNGO
achieves accuracy on unseen material properties close to that of an oracle
model.

Abstract: GeoAI is evolving rapidly, fueled by diverse geospatial datasets like traffic
patterns, environmental data, and crowdsourced OpenStreetMap (OSM) information.
While sophisticated AI models are being developed, existing benchmarks are
often concentrated on single tasks and restricted to a single modality. As
such, progress in GeoAI is limited by the lack of a standardized, multi-task,
modality-agnostic benchmark for their systematic evaluation. This paper
introduces a novel benchmark designed to assess the performance, accuracy, and
efficiency of geospatial embedders. Our benchmark is modality-agnostic and
comprises 7 distinct datasets from diverse cities across three continents,
ensuring generalizability and mitigating demographic biases. It allows for the
evaluation of GeoAI embedders on various phenomena that exhibit underlying
geographic processes. Furthermore, we establish a simple and intuitive
task-oriented model baselines, providing a crucial reference point for
comparing more complex solutions.

Abstract: Transformers' quadratic computational complexity limits their scalability
despite remarkable performance. While linear attention reduces this to linear
complexity, pre-training such models from scratch remains, in most cases,
prohibitively expensive. Recent post-training linearisation methods convert
pre-trained Transformers to linear models efficiently, often using hybrid
approaches that combine linear attention with sliding-window softmax. We
identify a critical flaw: existing hybrid methods inadvertently bypass the
linear component, relying almost entirely on SWA. Component-level diagnostics
reveal this previously undetected behaviour stems from overlooked evaluation
practices on common-sense benchmarks. We propose three solutions to ensure
balanced component usage: (i) inference-time hybridisation of linear-only
conversions with sliding-window softmax; (ii) HedgeCATs, combining
attention-weight transfer with targeted LoRA fine-tuning; and (iii) Scheduled
Sliding-window Dropout (SSD), which stochastically suppresses the softmax
branch during training to prevent component collapse. Our methods maintain
computational efficiency while recovering most base model performance and
ensuring genuine linear attention adoption, restoring the validity of
performance attributions in hybrid conversions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究比较了三种基于自编码器的架构（CAE、VAE-BiLSTM、VAE-BiLSTM-MHA）在12导联心电图异常检测中的表现，其中带多头注意力的VAE-BiLSTM-MHA架构表现最佳，并集成到交互式仪表板中用于临床分诊。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心电图异常检测对于识别心血管疾病相关的偏差至关重要，需要开发有效的无监督异常检测方法。

Method: 使用三种自编码器架构：卷积自编码器（CAE）、带双向LSTM的变分自编码器（VAE-BiLSTM）以及带多头注意力的VAE-BiLSTM（VAE-BiLSTM-MHA），在正常ECG样本上训练以重建非异常心脏形态。

Result: 在CPSC数据集上，注意力增强的VAE-BiLSTM-MHA表现最佳，AUPRC为0.81，召回率为0.85，优于其他架构。

Conclusion: VAE-BiLSTM-MHA架构在ECG异常检测中表现最优，已集成到交互式仪表板中支持临床分诊，并与文献中的基线模型进行了性能比较。

Abstract: Anomaly detection in 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) is critical for
identifying deviations associated with cardiovascular disease. This work
presents a comparative analysis of three autoencoder-based architectures:
convolutional autoencoder (CAE), variational autoencoder with bidirectional
long short-term memory (VAE-BiLSTM), and VAE-BiLSTM with multi-head attention
(VAE-BiLSTM-MHA), for unsupervised anomaly detection in ECGs. To the best of
our knowledge, this study reports the first application of a VAE-BiLSTM-MHA
architecture to ECG anomaly detection. All models are trained on normal ECG
samples to reconstruct non-anomalous cardiac morphology and detect deviations
indicative of disease. Using a unified preprocessing and evaluation pipeline on
the public China Physiological Signal Challenge (CPSC) dataset, the
attention-augmented VAE achieves the best performance, with an AUPRC of 0.81
and a recall of 0.85 on the held-out test set, outperforming the other
architectures. To support clinical triage, this model is further integrated
into an interactive dashboard that visualizes anomaly localization. In
addition, a performance comparison with baseline models from the literature is
provided.

TL;DR: 提出Carré du champ flow matching (CDC-FM)方法，通过几何感知噪声正则化概率路径，改善生成模型在质量与泛化之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度生成模型面临质量与记忆化的基本权衡：高质量样本可能以记忆训练数据为代价，而非泛化到数据几何结构。

Method: 将流匹配中的均匀各向同性噪声替换为空间变化、各向异性的高斯噪声，其协方差捕捉潜在数据流形的局部几何结构。

Result: 在多种数据集和神经网络架构上的实验表明，CDC-FM始终提供更好的质量-泛化权衡，在数据稀缺和非均匀采样场景中显著优于标准流匹配。

Conclusion: 提供了一个研究生成模型中数据几何、泛化和记忆化之间相互作用的数学框架，以及可轻松集成到现有流匹配流程的鲁棒可扩展算法。

Abstract: Deep generative models often face a fundamental tradeoff: high sample quality
can come at the cost of memorisation, where the model reproduces training data
rather than generalising across the underlying data geometry. We introduce
Carr\'e du champ flow matching (CDC-FM), a generalisation of flow matching
(FM), that improves the quality-generalisation tradeoff by regularising the
probability path with a geometry-aware noise. Our method replaces the
homogeneous, isotropic noise in FM with a spatially varying, anisotropic
Gaussian noise whose covariance captures the local geometry of the latent data
manifold. We prove that this geometric noise can be optimally estimated from
the data and is scalable to large data. Further, we provide an extensive
experimental evaluation on diverse datasets (synthetic manifolds, point clouds,
single-cell genomics, animal motion capture, and images) as well as various
neural network architectures (MLPs, CNNs, and transformers). We demonstrate
that CDC-FM consistently offers a better quality-generalisation tradeoff. We
observe significant improvements over standard FM in data-scarce regimes and in
highly non-uniformly sampled datasets, which are often encountered in AI for
science applications. Our work provides a mathematical framework for studying
the interplay between data geometry, generalisation and memorisation in
generative models, as well as a robust and scalable algorithm that can be
readily integrated into existing flow matching pipelines.

TL;DR: LLM-FS-Agent是一种多智能体架构，通过让多个LLM智能体进行"辩论"来实现可解释的特征选择，在网络安全领域表现出色，显著减少训练时间并保持分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维数据在机器学习中普遍存在，会降低模型可解释性和计算效率。现有的基于LLM的特征选择方法缺乏结构化推理和透明决策依据。

Method: 提出LLM-FS-Agent多智能体架构，让多个LLM智能体扮演不同角色进行集体"辩论"，共同评估特征相关性并生成详细理由。

Result: 在CIC-DIAD 2024物联网入侵检测数据集上测试，LLM-FS-Agent在保持分类性能的同时，平均减少下游训练时间46%（XGBoost的p=0.028，统计显著）。

Conclusion: 该审议架构提高了决策透明度和计算效率，使LLM-FS-Agent成为实际应用的实用可靠解决方案。

Abstract: High-dimensional data remains a pervasive challenge in machine learning,
often undermining model interpretability and computational efficiency. While
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise for dimensionality reduction
through feature selection, existing LLM-based approaches frequently lack
structured reasoning and transparent justification for their decisions. This
paper introduces LLM-FS-Agent, a novel multi-agent architecture designed for
interpretable and robust feature selection. The system orchestrates a
deliberative "debate" among multiple LLM agents, each assigned a specific role,
enabling collective evaluation of feature relevance and generation of detailed
justifications. We evaluate LLM-FS-Agent in the cybersecurity domain using the
CIC-DIAD 2024 IoT intrusion detection dataset and compare its performance
against strong baselines, including LLM-Select and traditional methods such as
PCA. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-FS-Agent consistently achieves
superior or comparable classification performance while reducing downstream
training time by an average of 46% (statistically significant improvement, p =
0.028 for XGBoost). These findings highlight that the proposed deliberative
architecture enhances both decision transparency and computational efficiency,
establishing LLM-FS-Agent as a practical and reliable solution for real-world
applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示JEPA框架中防坍塌项的深层作用，证明其不仅能防止表示坍塌，还能估计数据密度，为数据管理、异常检测等任务提供新工具。

Method: 通过理论分析证明JEPA防坍塌项与数据密度的关系，提出JEPA-SCORE方法，利用模型在样本处的Jacobian矩阵高效计算学习到的概率。

Result: 在合成数据、受控数据和ImageNet等数据集上验证了理论发现，适用于I-JEPA、DINOv2等JEPA家族方法及MetaCLIP等多模态模型。

Conclusion: JEPA框架具有超出预期的密度估计能力，为自监督学习模型提供了新的应用场景，JEPA-SCORE方法可高效提取学习到的概率分布。

Abstract: Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) learn representations able
to solve numerous downstream tasks out-of-the-box. JEPAs combine two
objectives: (i) a latent-space prediction term, i.e., the representation of a
slightly perturbed sample must be predictable from the original sample's
representation, and (ii) an anti-collapse term, i.e., not all samples should
have the same representation. While (ii) is often considered as an obvious
remedy to representation collapse, we uncover that JEPAs' anti-collapse term
does much more--it provably estimates the data density. In short, any
successfully trained JEPA can be used to get sample probabilities, e.g., for
data curation, outlier detection, or simply for density estimation. Our
theoretical finding is agnostic of the dataset and architecture used--in any
case one can compute the learned probabilities of sample $x$ efficiently and in
closed-form using the model's Jacobian matrix at $x$. Our findings are
empirically validated across datasets (synthetic, controlled, and Imagenet) and
across different Self Supervised Learning methods falling under the JEPA family
(I-JEPA and DINOv2) and on multimodal models, such as MetaCLIP. We denote the
method extracting the JEPA learned density as {\bf JEPA-SCORE}.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在LLM复杂推理中存在矛盾：一方面需要增加随机性来探索多种推理路径，另一方面又要确保每条路径的质量。传统方法将置信度与答案质量等同，但实际上置信度低不一定意味着答案质量差。

Method: 提出三种简单策略：Greedy-Threshold在极低置信度步骤采用贪婪采样；Calibrated-TopK和Calibrated-epsilon基于估计的按排名正确性设置截断阈值。

Result: 在数学和通用推理基准测试中显示出性能提升，挑战了关于不确定性下解码的普遍启发式方法。

Conclusion: 解码规则应该基于正确性而非置信度进行校准，在预期正确性高的地方采样，在预期正确性低的地方减少采样，这比传统方法更有效。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to complex tasks that
require extended reasoning. In such settings, models often benefit from diverse
chains-of-thought to arrive at multiple candidate solutions. This requires two
competing objectives: to inject enough stochasticity to explore multiple
reasoning chains, and to ensure sufficient accuracy and quality in each path.
Existing works pursue the first objective by increasing exploration at highly
uncertain steps with higher temperature or larger candidate token sets, while
others improve reliability by rejecting samples with low confidence
post-generation, implying that low confidence correlates with low answer
quality. These two lines of thought are in conflict, as they conflate different
sources of uncertainty. To resolve this, we argue that the decoding rule should
be calibrated by correctness, not confidence alone. We should sample from
tokens with higher estimated correctness, and reduce sampling where expected
correctness is low. We propose simple strategies that achieve this goal:
Greedy-Threshold makes sampling greedy at very low confidence steps.
Calibrated-TopK and Calibrated-epsilon set truncation threshold based on
estimated rank-wise correctness. Together, our findings challenge prevailing
heuristics about decoding under uncertainty and show gains across math and
general reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: 科学规则可作为强大的归纳偏置，在数据有限的科学领域实现鲁棒的自监督学习。

Abstract: Transferring the recent advancements in deep learning into scientific
disciplines is hindered by the lack of the required large-scale datasets for
training. We argue that in these knowledge-rich domains, the established body
of scientific theory provides reliable inductive biases in the form of
governing physical laws. We address the ill-posed inverse problem of recovering
Raman spectra from noisy Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS)
measurements, as the true Raman signal here is suppressed by a dominating
non-resonant background. We propose RamPINN, a model that learns to recover
Raman spectra from given CARS spectra. Our core methodological contribution is
a physics-informed neural network that utilizes a dual-decoder architecture to
disentangle resonant and non-resonant signals. This is done by enforcing the
Kramers-Kronig causality relations via a differentiable Hilbert transform loss
on the resonant and a smoothness prior on the non-resonant part of the signal.
Trained entirely on synthetic data, RamPINN demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization to real-world experimental data, explicitly closing this gap and
significantly outperforming existing baselines. Furthermore, we show that
training with these physics-based losses alone, without access to any
ground-truth Raman spectra, still yields competitive results. This work
highlights a broader concept: formal scientific rules can act as a potent
inductive bias, enabling robust, self-supervised learning in data-limited
scientific domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OOD检测对AI可靠性至关重要，但在实际应用中训练数据往往有限。贝叶斯神经网络能够显式表示模型不确定性，在小数据场景下特别有价值。

Method: 引入基于期望logit向量的贝叶斯后验OOD评分方法，比较了5种贝叶斯和4种确定性后验OOD评分方法。

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上，使用5000个或更少训练样本的实验表明，贝叶斯方法优于相应的确定性方法。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯方法在小样本OOD检测中表现更优，特别是在训练数据有限的情况下。

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is critical to AI reliability and safety,
yet in many practical settings, only a limited amount of training data is
available. Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) are a promising class of model on
which to base OOD detection, because they explicitly represent epistemic (i.e.
model) uncertainty. In the small training data regime, BNNs are especially
valuable because they can incorporate prior model information. We introduce a
new family of Bayesian posthoc OOD scores based on expected logit vectors, and
compare 5 Bayesian and 4 deterministic posthoc OOD scores. Experiments on MNIST
and CIFAR-10 In-Distributions, with 5000 training samples or less, show that
the Bayesian methods outperform corresponding deterministic methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在过参数化插值机制下Gibbs算法的泛化性能，特别是在低训练误差但可能泛化性能差的情况下（如随机标签分类），提供理论保证。

Method: 使用数据依赖的边界分析Gibbs算法，考虑Langevin Monte Carlo算法的近似稳定性，在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上进行实验验证。

Result: 边界在真实标记数据上产生非平凡预测，并能正确上界随机标签的测试误差。方法表明低温度插值机制下的泛化性能已在高温度机制下的低训练误差中体现。

Conclusion: 提出的数据依赖边界有效刻画了Gibbs算法在过参数化插值机制下的泛化性能，为理解深度学习中的泛化现象提供了理论工具。

Abstract: The paper provides data-dependent bounds on the test error of the Gibbs
algorithm in the overparameterized interpolation regime, where low training
errors are also obtained for impossible data, such as random labels in
classification. The bounds are stable under approximation with Langevin Monte
Carlo algorithms. Experiments on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets verify that
the bounds yield nontrivial predictions on true labeled data and correctly
upper bound the test error for random labels. Our method indicates that
generalization in the low-temperature, interpolation regime is already signaled
by small training errors in the more classical high temperature regime.

Conclusion: molFTP提供了一种快速、防泄漏的片段-靶点流行度向量化方法，通过虚拟掩码或关键留一法以低成本近似留一法验证。

Abstract: We introduce molFTP (molecular fragment-target prevalence), a compact
representation that delivers strong predictive performance. To prevent feature
leakage across cross-validation folds, we implement a dummy-masking procedure
that removes information about fragments present in the held-out molecules. We
further show that key leave-one-out (key-loo) closely approximates true
molecule-level leave-one-out (LOO), with deviation below 8% on our datasets.
This enables near full data training while preserving unbiased cross-validation
estimates of model performance. Overall, molFTP provides a fast,
leakage-resistant fragment-target prevalence vectorization with practical
safeguards (dummy masking or key-LOO) that approximate LOO at a fraction of its
cost.

Conclusion: 所提出的H-DSAC方法成功地将人类指导融入强化学习过程，为真实世界自动驾驶提供了安全高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous driving with reinforcement learning (RL) has significant
potential. However, applying RL in real-world settings remains challenging due
to the need for safe, efficient, and robust learning. Incorporating human
expertise into the learning process can help overcome these challenges by
reducing risky exploration and improving sample efficiency. In this work, we
propose a reward-free, active human-in-the-loop learning method called
Human-Guided Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (H-DSAC). Our method combines
Proxy Value Propagation (PVP) and Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (DSAC) to
enable efficient and safe training in real-world environments. The key
innovation is the construction of a distributed proxy value function within the
DSAC framework. This function encodes human intent by assigning higher expected
returns to expert demonstrations and penalizing actions that require human
intervention. By extrapolating these labels to unlabeled states, the policy is
effectively guided toward expert-like behavior. With a well-designed state
space, our method achieves real-world driving policy learning within practical
training times. Results from both simulation and real-world experiments
demonstrate that our framework enables safe, robust, and sample-efficient
learning for autonomous driving.

Method: 使用小型代理模型作为LLM替代，通过双层优化训练评分模型，为训练样本分配重要性权重，确保代理模型在加权损失上收敛时获得最佳验证性能。

Conclusion: BLISS提供了一种无需外部模型的数据选择方法，能有效识别高质量训练样本，显著提升LLM预训练效率。

Abstract: Effective data selection is essential for pretraining large language models
(LLMs), enhancing efficiency and improving generalization to downstream tasks.
However, existing approaches often require leveraging external pretrained
models, making it difficult to disentangle the effects of data selection from
those of the external pretrained models. In addition, they often overlook the
long-term impact of selected data if the model is trained to convergence,
primarily due to the prohibitive cost of full-scale LLM pretraining. In this
paper, we introduce BLISS (\textbf{B}ileve\textbf{L} \textbf{I}nfluence
\textbf{S}coring method for data \textbf{S}election): a lightweight data
selection method that operates entirely \emph{from scratch}, without relying on
any external pretrained oracle models, while explicitly accounting for the
long-term impact of selected data. BLISS leverages a small proxy model as a
surrogate for the LLM and employs a score model to estimate the long-term
influence of training samples if the proxy model is trained to convergence. We
formulate data selection as a bilevel optimization problem, where the
upper-level objective optimizes the score model to assign importance weights to
training samples, ensuring that minimizing the lower-level objective (i.e.,
training the proxy model over the weighted training loss until convergence)
leads to best validation performance. Once optimized, the trained score model
predicts influence scores for the dataset, enabling efficient selection of
high-quality samples for LLM pretraining. We validate BLISS by pretraining
410M/1B/2.8B Pythia and LLaMA-0.5B models on selected subsets of the C4
dataset. Notably, under the 1B model setting, BLISS achieves $1.7\times$
speedup in reaching the same performance as the state-of-the-art method,
demonstrating superior performance across multiple downstream tasks.

Conclusion: 编辑流过程提供了一个灵活高效的时序点过程建模方法，有效减少了生成过程中所需的编辑操作数量。

Abstract: Temporal point processes (TPPs) are a fundamental tool for modeling event
sequences in continuous time, but most existing approaches rely on
autoregressive parameterizations that are limited by their sequential sampling.
Recent non-autoregressive, diffusion-style models mitigate these issues by
jointly interpolating between noise and data through event insertions and
deletions in a discrete Markov chain. In this work, we generalize this
perspective and introduce an Edit Flow process for TPPs that transports noise
to data via insert, delete, and substitute edit operations. By learning the
instantaneous edit rates within a continuous-time Markov chain framework, we
attain a flexible and efficient model that effectively reduces the total number
of necessary edit operations during generation. Empirical results demonstrate
the generative flexibility of our unconditionally trained model in a wide range
of unconditional and conditional generation tasks on benchmark TPPs.

Conclusion: 通过控制过平滑，深度GNN可以在某些任务中超越浅层网络，合理分配邻接跳数到少量可训练层可以避免欠参数化或过参数化问题。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the factors that contribute to the effect of
oversmoothing in deep Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Specifically, our analysis
is based on a new metric (Mean Average Squared Distance - $MASED$) to quantify
the extent of oversmoothing. We derive layer-wise bounds on $MASED$, which
aggregate to yield global upper and lower distance bounds. Based on this
quantification of oversmoothing, we further analyze the importance of two
different properties of the model; namely the norms of the generated node
embeddings, along with the largest and smallest singular values of the weight
matrices. Building on the insights drawn from the theoretical analysis, we show
that oversmoothing increases as the number of trainable weight matrices and the
number of adjacency matrices increases. We also use the derived layer-wise
bounds on $MASED$ to form a proposal for decoupling the number of hops (i.e.,
adjacency depth) from the number of weight matrices. In particular, we
introduce G-Reg, a regularization scheme that increases the bounds, and
demonstrate through extensive experiments that by doing so node classification
accuracy increases, achieving robustness at large depths. We further show that
by reducing oversmoothing in deep networks, we can achieve better results in
some tasks than using shallow ones. Specifically, we experiment with a ``cold
start" scenario, i.e., when there is no feature information for the unlabeled
nodes. Finally, we show empirically the trade-off between receptive field size
(i.e., number of weight matrices) and performance, using the $MASED$ bounds.
This is achieved by distributing adjacency hops across a small number of
trainable layers, avoiding the extremes of under- or over-parameterization of
the GNN.

*Nyal Patel,Matthieu Bou,Arjun Jagota,Satyapriya Krishna,Sonali Parbhoo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于失败感知的逆强化学习算法，专注于被错误分类或难以判断的样本，从而更准确地提取RLHF中学习到的潜在奖励信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF虽然能对齐大语言模型与人类偏好，但其内部学习的奖励信号是隐式的，这给可解释性和安全性带来了挑战。现有的IRL方法对所有偏好对一视同仁，忽略了最具信息量的失败样本。

Method: 开发了失败感知IRL算法，重点关注被提取的奖励模型错误分类或评分相近的样本，通过这些失败案例来恢复定义模型行为的潜在奖励。

Result: 在LLM去毒化任务中，失败感知IRL在多个指标上优于现有IRL基线，无需外部分类器或监督。提取的奖励能更好地捕捉RLHF学习的真实激励，实现比标准IRL更有效的重新RLHF训练。

Conclusion: 失败感知IRL是一种稳健、可扩展的方法，可用于审计模型对齐并减少IRL过程中的模糊性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) aligns Large Language
Models (LLMs) with human preferences, yet the underlying reward signals they
internalize remain hidden, posing a critical challenge for interpretability and
safety. Existing approaches attempt to extract these latent incentives using
Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), but treat all preference pairs equally,
often overlooking the most informative signals: those examples the extracted
reward model misclassifies or assigns nearly equal scores, which we term
\emph{failures}. We introduce a novel \emph{failure-aware} IRL algorithm that
focuses on misclassified or difficult examples to recover the latent rewards
defining model behaviors. By learning from these failures, our failure-aware
IRL extracts reward functions that better reflect the true objectives behind
RLHF. We demonstrate that failure-aware IRL outperforms existing IRL baselines
across multiple metrics when applied to LLM detoxification, without requiring
external classifiers or supervision. Crucially, failure-aware IRL yields
rewards that better capture the true incentives learned during RLHF, enabling
more effective re-RLHF training than standard IRL. This establishes
failure-aware IRL as a robust, scalable method for auditing model alignment and
reducing ambiguity in the IRL process.

*Matthieu Bou,Nyal Patel,Arjun Jagota,Satyapriya Krishna,Sonali Parbhoo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于贝叶斯逆强化学习的LLM审计框架，通过量化目标函数的不确定性、识别虚假捷径和验证策略效用，来解决LLM目标函数不透明的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型隐含优化的目标函数极度不透明，使得可信对齐和审计成为重大挑战。现有逆强化学习方法要么产生单一、过度自信的奖励估计，要么无法解决任务的基本模糊性问题。

Method: 采用贝叶斯逆强化学习方法，不仅恢复目标函数的分布，还实现了三个关键审计能力：量化并系统减少非可识别性、提供不确定性感知的诊断、验证策略级效用。

Result: 该框架成功审计了一个去毒化的LLM，产生了一个校准良好且可解释的目标函数，增强了对齐保证。

Conclusion: 这项工作为审计人员、安全团队和监管机构提供了一个实用工具包，用于验证LLM的真正目标，推动AI向更可信和可问责的方向发展。

Abstract: The objectives that Large Language Models (LLMs) implicitly optimize remain
dangerously opaque, making trustworthy alignment and auditing a grand
challenge. While Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) can infer reward
functions from behaviour, existing approaches either produce a single,
overconfident reward estimate or fail to address the fundamental ambiguity of
the task (non-identifiability). This paper introduces a principled auditing
framework that re-frames reward inference from a simple estimation task to a
comprehensive process for verification. Our framework leverages Bayesian IRL to
not only recover a distribution over objectives but to enable three critical
audit capabilities: (i) Quantifying and systematically reducing
non-identifiability by demonstrating posterior contraction over sequential
rounds of evidence; (ii) Providing actionable, uncertainty-aware diagnostics
that expose spurious shortcuts and identify out-of-distribution prompts where
the inferred objective cannot be trusted; and (iii) Validating policy-level
utility by showing that the refined, low-uncertainty reward can be used
directly in RLHF to achieve training dynamics and toxicity reductions
comparable to the ground-truth alignment process. Empirically, our framework
successfully audits a detoxified LLM, yielding a well-calibrated and
interpretable objective that strengthens alignment guarantees. Overall, this
work provides a practical toolkit for auditors, safety teams, and regulators to
verify what LLMs are truly trying to achieve, moving us toward more trustworthy
and accountable AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度神经网络取得了显著成功，但我们对其学习机制的理解仍然有限。模型能够学习统计上难以处理的高维任务，这表明可学习数据必须具有潜在的底层结构。

Method: 通过研究数据、任务和深度学习表示中的局部性和组合性作用来探讨这些问题。

Result: 论文发现局部性和组合性是深度神经网络能够有效学习高维任务的关键结构特征。

Conclusion: 数据中的局部性和组合性结构是深度神经网络克服维度诅咒、实现有效学习的重要机制。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success, yet our understanding
of how they learn remains limited. These models can learn high-dimensional
tasks, which is generally statistically intractable due to the curse of
dimensionality. This apparent paradox suggests that learnable data must have an
underlying latent structure. What is the nature of this structure? How do
neural networks encode and exploit it, and how does it quantitatively impact
performance - for instance, how does generalization improve with the number of
training examples? This thesis addresses these questions by studying the roles
of locality and compositionality in data, tasks, and deep learning
representations.

Motivation: 现有推理方法依赖间接启发式指标（如问题难度或轨迹长度），而指令调优虽然探索了更广泛的自动选择策略，但很少在推理背景下使用。高质量推理数据的定义仍不明确。

Method: 提出使用影响力函数来衡量单个CoT示例对下游准确率的因果效应，并引入基于影响力的剪枝方法

Result: 在模型家族内的数学推理任务中，基于影响力的剪枝方法始终优于困惑度和基于嵌入的基线方法

Conclusion: 影响力函数为定义推理数据质量提供了有效方法，基于影响力的选择策略在推理任务中表现优异

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on chain-of-thought (CoT) data shows
that a small amount of high-quality data can outperform massive datasets. Yet,
what constitutes "quality" remains ill-defined. Existing reasoning methods rely
on indirect heuristics such as problem difficulty or trace length, while
instruction-tuning has explored a broader range of automated selection
strategies, but rarely in the context of reasoning. We propose to define
reasoning data quality using influence functions, which measure the causal
effect of individual CoT examples on downstream accuracy, and introduce
influence-based pruning, which consistently outperforms perplexity and
embedding-based baselines on math reasoning within a model family.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图描述符的MMD指标只能相对排序生成模型，无法提供绝对性能度量，且对核函数和描述符参数化高度敏感，导致不同描述符间的指标不可比较。

Method: 使用二元分类器区分真实图和生成图，通过分类器的数据对数似然近似图分布的JS距离变分下界，得到约束在[0,1]区间内的可比较指标。

Result: PGD相比MMD指标提供了更鲁棒和深入的评估，并推导出理论上有依据的汇总指标来提供给定描述符下的最紧下界。

Conclusion: PGD框架解决了图生成模型评估中的关键问题，提供了更可靠和可解释的评估方法，相关代码已开源。

Abstract: Existing methods for evaluating graph generative models primarily rely on
Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) metrics based on graph descriptors. While these
metrics can rank generative models, they do not provide an absolute measure of
performance. Their values are also highly sensitive to extrinsic parameters,
namely kernel and descriptor parametrization, making them incomparable across
different graph descriptors. We introduce PolyGraph Discrepancy (PGD), a new
evaluation framework that addresses these limitations. It approximates the
Jensen-Shannon distance of graph distributions by fitting binary classifiers to
distinguish between real and generated graphs, featurized by these descriptors.
The data log-likelihood of these classifiers approximates a variational lower
bound on the JS distance between the two distributions. Resulting metrics are
constrained to the unit interval [0,1] and are comparable across different
graph descriptors. We further derive a theoretically grounded summary metric
that combines these individual metrics to provide a maximally tight lower bound
on the distance for the given descriptors. Thorough experiments demonstrate
that PGD provides a more robust and insightful evaluation compared to MMD
metrics. The PolyGraph framework for benchmarking graph generative models is
made publicly available at https://github.com/BorgwardtLab/polygraph-benchmark.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中模型压缩技术虽然能减小模型尺寸和计算成本，但传统评估只关注尺寸与准确性的权衡，忽略了模型忠实性这一关键维度，这在医疗、金融等高风险领域尤为重要。

Method: 引入忠实性评估指标，包括使用模型一致性评估预测一致性，应用卡方检验检测整体数据集和人口统计子组中预测模式的统计显著变化。

Result: 研究发现高准确性并不能保证忠实性，统计测试检测到了标准指标（如准确性和均等机会）遗漏的细微但显著的变化。

Conclusion: 提出的指标提供了一种实用且更直接的方法，确保通过压缩获得的效率提升不会损害可信AI所必需的公平性或忠实性。

Abstract: In real-world applications, computational constraints often require
transforming large models into smaller, more efficient versions through model
compression. While these techniques aim to reduce size and computational cost
without sacrificing performance, their evaluations have traditionally focused
on the trade-off between size and accuracy, overlooking the aspect of model
faithfulness. This limited view is insufficient for high-stakes domains like
healthcare, finance, and criminal justice, where compressed models must remain
faithful to the behavior of their original counterparts. This paper presents a
novel approach to evaluating faithfulness in compressed models, moving beyond
standard metrics. We introduce and demonstrate a set of faithfulness metrics
that capture how model behavior changes post-compression. Our contributions
include introducing techniques to assess predictive consistency between the
original and compressed models using model agreement, and applying chi-squared
tests to detect statistically significant changes in predictive patterns across
both the overall dataset and demographic subgroups, thereby exposing shifts
that aggregate fairness metrics may obscure. We demonstrate our approaches by
applying quantization and pruning to artificial neural networks (ANNs) trained
on three diverse and socially meaningful datasets. Our findings show that high
accuracy does not guarantee faithfulness, and our statistical tests detect
subtle yet significant shifts that are missed by standard metrics, such as
Accuracy and Equalized Odds. The proposed metrics provide a practical and more
direct method for ensuring that efficiency gains through compression do not
compromise the fairness or faithfulness essential for trustworthy AI.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了lm-Meter，这是首个专为设备端LLM推理设计的轻量级在线延迟分析器，能够在不使用辅助设备的情况下捕获细粒度的实时延迟信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在日常应用中的集成，基于云的部署引发了数据隐私和可持续性担忧。在移动和边缘设备上本地运行LLM可以增强隐私、可靠性和降低通信成本，但由于内存和计算需求大，以及资源受限硬件上性能-效率权衡的可见性有限，实现这一愿景仍具挑战性。

Method: lm-Meter在商用移动平台上实现，能够捕获细粒度的实时延迟，包括阶段级（如嵌入、预填充、解码、softmax、采样）和内核级延迟，且系统开销极小。

Result: lm-Meter在最具约束的Powersave调控器下，预填充阶段吞吐量仅降低2.58%，解码阶段仅降低0.99%，显示出高分析精度和最小系统开销。通过lm-Meter进行的实证研究揭示了设备端LLM推理中的阶段级和内核级瓶颈，量化了精度-效率权衡，并识别了系统性优化机会。

Conclusion: lm-Meter为受限平台上LLM的运行时行为提供了前所未有的可见性，为知情优化奠定了基础，并加速了设备端LLM系统的民主化进程。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into everyday
applications, but their prevalent cloud-based deployment raises growing
concerns around data privacy and long-term sustainability. Running LLMs locally
on mobile and edge devices (on-device LLMs) offers the promise of enhanced
privacy, reliability, and reduced communication costs. However, realizing this
vision remains challenging due to substantial memory and compute demands, as
well as limited visibility into performance-efficiency trade-offs on
resource-constrained hardware. We propose lm-Meter, the first lightweight,
online latency profiler tailored for on-device LLM inference. lm-Meter captures
fine-grained, real-time latency at both phase (e.g., embedding, prefill,
decode, softmax, sampling) and kernel levels without auxiliary devices. We
implement lm-Meter on commercial mobile platforms and demonstrate its high
profiling accuracy with minimal system overhead, e.g., only 2.58% throughput
reduction in prefill and 0.99% in decode under the most constrained Powersave
governor. Leveraging lm-Meter, we conduct comprehensive empirical studies
revealing phase- and kernel-level bottlenecks in on-device LLM inference,
quantifying accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, and identifying systematic
optimization opportunities. lm-Meter provides unprecedented visibility into the
runtime behavior of LLMs on constrained platforms, laying the foundation for
informed optimization and accelerating the democratization of on-device LLM
systems. Code and tutorials are available at

Motivation: 多任务强化学习通常依赖任务元数据（如自然语言描述）来指导不同目标的行为，需要一种能够有效利用语言信息来索引和组合可重用技能的方法。

Method: 提出LEXPOL架构：使用文本编码器编码任务元数据，通过学习的门控模块选择和混合多个子策略，支持端到端的跨任务训练。

Result: 在MetaWorld基准测试中，LEXPOL在成功率和样本效率上匹配或超越了强大的多任务基线，无需任务特定的重新训练。学习到的语言门控能够组合专家策略来处理新任务描述和未见过的任务组合。

Conclusion: 自然语言元数据可以在单一策略内有效索引和重组可重用技能，为多任务强化学习提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning often relies on task metadata -- such as
brief natural-language descriptions -- to guide behavior across diverse
objectives. We present Lexical Policy Networks (LEXPOL), a language-conditioned
mixture-of-policies architecture for multi-task RL. LEXPOL encodes task
metadata with a text encoder and uses a learned gating module to select or
blend among multiple sub-policies, enabling end-to-end training across tasks.
On MetaWorld benchmarks, LEXPOL matches or exceeds strong multi-task baselines
in success rate and sample efficiency, without task-specific retraining. To
analyze the mechanism, we further study settings with fixed expert policies
obtained independently of the gate and show that the learned language gate
composes these experts to produce behaviors appropriate to novel task
descriptions and unseen task combinations. These results indicate that
natural-language metadata can effectively index and recombine reusable skills
within a single policy.

Motivation: 生物医学领域的数据通常只有少量观测但包含数千个潜在噪声特征，传统机器学习方法面临挑战。现有的基础模型无法处理大特征数量（>500），而特征降维会阻碍特征重要性分析。

Method: 通过继续在从定制先验采样的合成数据上进行预训练来扩展现有模型，开发了TabPFN-Wide模型。

Result: TabPFN-Wide匹配或超越其基础模型的性能，同时表现出对噪声的改进鲁棒性。能够无缝扩展到50,000多个特征，无论噪声水平如何，同时保持固有的可解释性。

Conclusion: 先验信息适应的策略适合增强基础模型处理高维数据的能力。在真实生物医学数据集中，模型识别的许多最相关特征与先前生物学发现重叠，而其他特征为未来研究提出了潜在起点。

Abstract: Revealing novel insights from the relationship between molecular measurements
and pathology remains a very impactful application of machine learning in
biomedicine. Data in this domain typically contain only a few observations but
thousands of potentially noisy features, posing challenges for conventional
machine learning approaches. While prior-data fitted networks emerge as
foundation models for tabular data, they are currently not suited to handle
large feature counts (>500). Although feature reduction enables their
application, it hinders feature importance analysis. We propose a strategy that
extends existing models through continued pre-training on synthetic data
sampled from a customized prior. The resulting model, TabPFN-Wide, matches or
exceeds its base model's performance while exhibiting improved robustness to
noise. It seamlessly scales beyond 50,000 features, regardless of noise levels,
while maintaining inherent interpretability, which is critical for biomedical
applications. Our results show that prior-informed adaptation is suitable to
enhance the capability of foundation models for high-dimensional data. On
real-world biomedical datasets many of the most relevant features identified by
the model overlap with previous biological findings, while others propose
potential starting points for future studies.

Abstract: Feature attributions are post-training analysis methods that assess how
various input features of a machine learning model contribute to an output
prediction. Their interpretation is straightforward when features act
independently, but becomes less direct when the predictive model involves
interactions such as multiplicative relationships or joint feature
contributions. In this work, we propose a general theory of higher-order
feature attribution, which we develop on the foundation of Integrated Gradients
(IG). This work extends existing frameworks in the literature on explainable
AI. When using IG as the method of feature attribution, we discover natural
connections to statistics and topological signal processing. We provide several
theoretical results that establish the theory, and we validate our theory on a
few examples.

Abstract: We establish a fundamental connection between score-based diffusion models
and non-equilibrium thermodynamics by deriving performance limits based on
entropy rates. Our main theoretical contribution is a lower bound on the
negative log-likelihood of the data that relates model performance to entropy
rates of diffusion processes. We numerically validate this bound on a synthetic
dataset and investigate its tightness. By building a bridge to entropy rates -
system, intrinsic, and exchange entropy - we provide new insights into the
thermodynamic operation of these models, drawing parallels to Maxwell's demon
and implications for thermodynamic computing hardware. Our framework connects

Conclusion: 通过自适应集成高斯过程模型和共形预测阈值设置，实现了对图结构数据更有效的不确定性量化。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) over graphs arises in a number of
safety-critical applications in network science. The Gaussian process (GP), as
a classical Bayesian framework for UQ, has been developed to handle
graph-structured data by devising topology-aware kernel functions. However,
such GP-based approaches are limited not only by the prohibitive computational
complexity, but also the strict modeling assumptions that might yield poor
coverage, especially with labels arriving on the fly. To effect scalability, we
devise a novel graph-aware parametric GP model by leveraging the random feature
(RF)-based kernel approximation, which is amenable to efficient recursive
Bayesian model updates. To further allow for adaptivity, an ensemble of
graph-aware RF-based scalable GPs have been leveraged, with per-GP weight
adapted to data arriving incrementally. To ensure valid coverage with
robustness to model mis-specification, we wed the GP-based set predictors with
the online conformal prediction framework, which post-processes the prediction
sets using adaptive thresholds. Experimental results the proposed method yields
improved coverage and efficient prediction sets over existing baselines by
adaptively ensembling the GP models and setting the key threshold parameters in
CP.

Method: RGSD首先进行对比预训练，将动作嵌入到单位超球面上，将每个参考轨迹聚类到不同的方向。这种基础使技能发现能够同时涉及参考行为的模仿和语义相关多样化行为的发现。

Conclusion: 轻量级的参考引导基础为在高自由度系统中发现语义丰富和结构化的技能提供了一条实用路径。

Abstract: Scaling unsupervised skill discovery algorithms to high-DoF agents remains
challenging. As dimensionality increases, the exploration space grows
exponentially, while the manifold of meaningful skills remains limited.
Therefore, semantic meaningfulness becomes essential to effectively guide
exploration in high-dimensional spaces. In this work, we present
Reference-Grounded Skill Discovery (RGSD), a novel algorithm that grounds skill
discovery in a semantically meaningful latent space using reference data. RGSD
first performs contrastive pretraining to embed motions on a unit hypersphere,
clustering each reference trajectory into a distinct direction. This grounding
enables skill discovery to simultaneously involve both imitation of reference
behaviors and the discovery of semantically related diverse behaviors. On a
simulated SMPL humanoid with 359-D observations and 69-D actions, RGSD learns
structured skills including walking, running, punching, and side stepping, and
also discovers related novel behaviors. In downstream control tasks, RGSD
outperforms imitation-based skill acquisition baselines. Our results suggest
that lightweight reference-guided grounding offers a practical path to
discovering semantically rich and structured skills in high-DoF systems.

Motivation: 虽然后训练量化被广泛用于大语言模型的高效部署，但量化鲁棒性的内在机制尚不清楚。研究旨在准确评估训练动态与量化性能之间的关系。

Method: 对开源语言模型训练轨迹进行综合分析（最高32B参数和15T训练词元），并在受控实验中训练自己的模型（最高100B词元），研究训练动态干预措施。

Result: 发现量化误差主要由学习率与其他训练超参数的复杂相互作用驱动。一旦学习率衰减，验证损失和量化误差就会发散，且与训练数据规模基本无关。

Abstract: While post-training quantization is widely adopted for efficient deployment
of large language models, the mechanisms underlying quantization robustness
remain unclear. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of quantization degradation
across open-source language model training trajectories up to 32B parameters

dynamics and quantization performance. Our key finding is that quantization
errors in large-scale training runs are driven by a complex interplay between
learning rate and other training hyperparameters. Specifically, once learning
rates decay, validation loss and quantization error diverge, largely
independent of training data scale. To investigate interventions on the
training dynamics and identify specific configurations that can modulate
quantization robustness favorably, we train our own models in controlled
experiments up to 100B tokens. Our results challenge the assumption that
increasing dataset scale inherently compromises quantization effectiveness,
demonstrating instead that strategic training hyperparameter interventions can
improve quantization quality at scale.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents increasingly rely on external tools such as
search engines to solve complex, multi-step problems, and reinforcement
learning (RL) has become a key paradigm for training them. However, the
trajectories of search agents are structurally heterogeneous, where variations
in the number, placement, and outcomes of search calls lead to fundamentally
different answer directions and reward distributions. Standard policy gradient
methods, which use a single global baseline, suffer from what we identify and
formalize as cross-stratum bias-an "apples-to-oranges" comparison of
heterogeneous trajectories. This cross-stratum bias distorts credit assignment
and hinders exploration of complex, multi-step search strategies. To address
this, we propose Stratified GRPO, whose central component, Stratified Advantage
Normalization (SAN), partitions trajectories into homogeneous strata based on
their structural properties and computes advantages locally within each
stratum. This ensures that trajectories are evaluated only against their true
peers. Our analysis proves that SAN eliminates cross-stratum bias, yields
conditionally unbiased unit-variance estimates inside each stratum, and retains
the global unbiasedness and unit-variance properties enjoyed by standard
normalization, resulting in a more pure and scale-stable learning signal. To
improve practical stability under finite-sample regimes, we further linearly
blend SAN with the global estimator. Extensive experiments on diverse
single-hop and multi-hop question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that
Stratified GRPO consistently and substantially outperforms GRPO by up to 11.3
points, achieving higher training rewards, greater training stability, and more
effective search policies. These results establish stratification as a
principled remedy for structural heterogeneity in RL for LLM search agents.
