### [1] [Runtime Failure Hunting for Physics Engine Based Software Systems: How Far Can We Go?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22099)
*Shuqing Li,Qiang Chen,Xiaoxue Ren,Michael R. Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文首次大规模实证研究物理引擎（PEs）中的物理失效问题，提出分类法、评估检测方法，并分享开发者见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理引擎在关键应用中易出现物理失效，现有测试方法不足，需改进。

Method: 研究物理失效表现、检测技术效果及开发者看法，提出分类法并评估多种检测方法。

Result: 提出物理失效分类法，评估深度学习等检测方法，分享开发者改进建议。

Conclusion: 研究为物理失效检测提供新见解和工具，支持未来研究。

Abstract: Physics Engines (PEs) are fundamental software frameworks that simulate
physical interactions in applications ranging from entertainment to
safety-critical systems. Despite their importance, PEs suffer from physics
failures, deviations from expected physical behaviors that can compromise
software reliability, degrade user experience, and potentially cause critical
failures in autonomous vehicles or medical robotics. Current testing approaches
for PE-based software are inadequate, typically requiring white-box access and
focusing on crash detection rather than semantically complex physics failures.
This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study characterizing
physics failures in PE-based software. We investigate three research questions
addressing the manifestations of physics failures, the effectiveness of
detection techniques, and developer perceptions of current detection practices.
Our contributions include: (1) a taxonomy of physics failure manifestations;
(2) a comprehensive evaluation of detection methods including deep learning,
prompt-based techniques, and large multimodal models; and (3) actionable
insights from developer experiences for improving detection approaches. To
support future research, we release PhysiXFails, code, and other materials at
https://sites.google.com/view/physics-failure-detection.

TL;DR: TRIG-Bench和TRIGScore的提出填补了图像生成模型在多维度权衡评估上的空白，通过DTM可视化模型能力，并展示了如何通过微调提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对图像生成模型在多维度（如质量、对齐、多样性等）权衡的系统评估，主要因为数据集和单一指标的局限性。

Method: 提出TRIG-Bench数据集和TRIGScore评估指标，涵盖10个维度，评估14个模型，并开发DTM可视化工具。

Result: 实验表明DTM能全面理解模型能力权衡，且通过微调可缓解模型在特定维度的弱点。

Conclusion: TRIG-Bench和TRIGScore为图像生成模型的评估提供了新工具，DTM可视化有助于优化模型性能。

Abstract: Model performance in text-to-image (T2I) and image-to-image (I2I) generation
often depends on multiple aspects, including quality, alignment, diversity, and
robustness. However, models' complex trade-offs among these dimensions have
rarely been explored due to (1) the lack of datasets that allow fine-grained
quantification of these trade-offs, and (2) the use of a single metric for
multiple dimensions. To bridge this gap, we introduce TRIG-Bench (Trade-offs in
Image Generation), which spans 10 dimensions (Realism, Originality, Aesthetics,
Content, Relation, Style, Knowledge, Ambiguity, Toxicity, and Bias), contains
40,200 samples, and covers 132 pairwise dimensional subsets. Furthermore, we
develop TRIGScore, a VLM-as-judge metric that automatically adapts to various
dimensions. Based on TRIG-Bench and TRIGScore, we evaluate 14 models across T2I
and I2I tasks. In addition, we propose the Relation Recognition System to
generate the Dimension Trade-off Map (DTM) that visualizes the trade-offs among
model-specific capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate that DTM consistently
provides a comprehensive understanding of the trade-offs between dimensions for
each type of generative model. Notably, we show that the model's
dimension-specific weaknesses can be mitigated through fine-tuning on DTM to
enhance overall performance. Code is available at:

techniques (e.g., vision transformers), and recent vision-language foundation
models (e.g., CLIP) in the agriculture domain, focusing on diverse tasks such
as crop disease detection, livestock health management, and aquatic species
monitoring. We further cover major implementation challenges such as data
variability and experimental aspects: datasets, performance evaluation metrics,
and geographical focus. We finish the survey by discussing potential open
research directions emphasizing the need for multimodal data integration,
efficient edge-device deployment, and domain-adaptable AI models for diverse
farming environments. Rapid growth of evolving developments in this field can

*Chaofei Qi,Zhitai Liu,Jianbin Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种受人类颜色感知启发的元学习框架ColorSense Learner，通过颜色通道交互和知识蒸馏提升少样本分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类颜色感知能力对元学习有重要启发，但传统方法忽视了颜色信息的作用。

Method: 提出ColorSense Learner框架，利用颜色通道特征提取和交互学习，并结合知识蒸馏的ColorSense Distiller。

Result: 在11个少样本基准测试中表现出强大的泛化能力、鲁棒性和迁移性。

Conclusion: 通过模拟人类颜色感知机制，显著提升了少样本分类的性能。

Abstract: Humans possess innate meta-learning capabilities, partly attributable to
their exceptional color perception. In this paper, we pioneer an innovative
viewpoint on few-shot learning by simulating human color perception mechanisms.
We propose the ColorSense Learner, a bio-inspired meta-learning framework that
capitalizes on inter-channel feature extraction and interactive learning. By
strategically emphasizing distinct color information across different channels,
our approach effectively filters irrelevant features while capturing
discriminative characteristics. Color information represents the most intuitive
visual feature, yet conventional meta-learning methods have predominantly
neglected this aspect, focusing instead on abstract feature differentiation
across categories. Our framework bridges the gap via synergistic color-channel
interactions, enabling better intra-class commonality extraction and larger
inter-class differences. Furthermore, we introduce a meta-distiller based on
knowledge distillation, ColorSense Distiller, which incorporates prior teacher
knowledge to augment the student network's meta-learning capacity. We've
conducted comprehensive coarse/fine-grained and cross-domain experiments on
eleven few-shot benchmarks for validation. Numerous experiments reveal that our
methods have extremely strong generalization ability, robustness, and
transferability, and effortless handle few-shot classification from the
perspective of color perception.

TL;DR: 深度学习模型（3D nnU-Net）在儿童脑肿瘤（PBTs）分割中表现良好，尤其对全肿瘤（WT）和T2高信号区域（T2H）效果显著，但对增强肿瘤（ET）和囊性成分（CC）分割仍有挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 儿童脑肿瘤（PBTs）的诊断和治疗存在挑战，深度学习分割方法有望提供更精准的肿瘤划分，但其在不同亚型和MRI协议中的性能尚不明确。

Method: 使用174例儿童患者的MRI数据（T1、T1-C、T2、FLAIR序列），训练3D nnU-Net模型，评估其在四种肿瘤亚区域的分割效果，并与人工标注对比。

Result: 模型在WT和T2H分割中表现稳健（DSC: 0.85），接近人工标注水平（DSC: 0.86），但ET和CC分割效果较差。部分MRI序列组合可简化协议。

Conclusion: 深度学习适用于PBTs分割，尤其是WT和T2H，但需进一步优化ET和CC分割。研究支持简化MRI协议和自动化流程的潜力。

Abstract: Background Brain tumours are the most common solid malignancies in children,
encompassing diverse histological, molecular subtypes and imaging features and
outcomes. Paediatric brain tumours (PBTs), including high- and low-grade
gliomas (HGG, LGG), medulloblastomas (MB), ependymomas, and rarer forms, pose
diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Deep learning (DL)-based segmentation
offers promising tools for tumour delineation, yet its performance across
heterogeneous PBT subtypes and MRI protocols remains uncertain. Methods A
retrospective single-centre cohort of 174 paediatric patients with HGG, LGG,
medulloblastomas (MB), ependymomas, and other rarer subtypes was used. MRI
sequences included T1, T1 post-contrast (T1-C), T2, and FLAIR. Manual
annotations were provided for four tumour subregions: whole tumour (WT),
T2-hyperintensity (T2H), enhancing tumour (ET), and cystic component (CC). A 3D
nnU-Net model was trained and tested (121/53 split), with segmentation
performance assessed using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and compared
against intra- and inter-rater variability. Results The model achieved robust
performance for WT and T2H (mean DSC: 0.85), comparable to human annotator
variability (mean DSC: 0.86). ET segmentation was moderately accurate (mean
DSC: 0.75), while CC performance was poor. Segmentation accuracy varied by
tumour type, MRI sequence combination, and location. Notably, T1, T1-C, and T2
alone produced results nearly equivalent to the full protocol. Conclusions DL
is feasible for PBTs, particularly for T2H and WT. Challenges remain for ET and
CC segmentation, highlighting the need for further refinement. These findings
support the potential for protocol simplification and automation to enhance
volumetric assessment and streamline paediatric neuro-oncology workflows.

### [6] [Temporally Consistent Unsupervised Segmentation for Mobile Robot Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22194)
*Christian Ellis,Maggie Wigness,Craig Lennon,Lance Fiondella*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Frontier-Seg是一种无需监督的方法，用于从移动机器人视频流中实现时间一致的无人监督地形分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督语义分割方法依赖昂贵的数据标注，且在未知环境中难以适用。无人监督方法缺乏时间一致性，影响鲁棒性。

Method: 利用DINOv2提取超像素级特征，并通过聚类和时间一致性约束识别地形边界。

Result: 在RUGD和RELLIS-3D等数据集上验证了其在非结构化环境中的有效性。

Conclusion: Frontier-Seg为无监督地形分割提供了时间一致的解决方案，适用于未知环境。

Abstract: Rapid progress in terrain-aware autonomous ground navigation has been driven
by advances in supervised semantic segmentation. However, these methods rely on
costly data collection and labor-intensive ground truth labeling to train deep
models. Furthermore, autonomous systems are increasingly deployed in
unrehearsed, unstructured environments where no labeled data exists and
semantic categories may be ambiguous or domain-specific. Recent zero-shot
approaches to unsupervised segmentation have shown promise in such settings but
typically operate on individual frames, lacking temporal consistency-a critical
property for robust perception in unstructured environments. To address this
gap we introduce Frontier-Seg, a method for temporally consistent unsupervised
segmentation of terrain from mobile robot video streams. Frontier-Seg clusters
superpixel-level features extracted from foundation model
backbones-specifically DINOv2-and enforces temporal consistency across frames
to identify persistent terrain boundaries or frontiers without human
supervision. We evaluate Frontier-Seg on a diverse set of benchmark
datasets-including RUGD and RELLIS-3D-demonstrating its ability to perform
unsupervised segmentation across unstructured off-road environments.

### [7] [SmartCLIP: Modular Vision-language Alignment with Identification Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22264)
*Shaoan Xie,Lingjing Kong,Yujia Zheng,Yu Yao,Zeyu Tang,Eric P. Xing,Guangyi Chen,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法SmartCLIP，解决了CLIP模型在图像-文本对齐中的信息错位和表示纠缠问题，通过模块化方式对齐最相关的视觉和文本表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型在图像-文本对齐中存在信息错位和表示纠缠问题，限制了其在某些下游任务中的泛化能力。

Method: 提出理论条件，支持跨粒度灵活对齐，并引入SmartCLIP方法，模块化对齐最相关的视觉和文本表示。

Result: SmartCLIP在多种任务中表现优异，验证了其处理信息错位的能力。

Conclusion: SmartCLIP通过模块化对齐解决了CLIP的问题，提升了模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)~\citep{radford2021learning}
has emerged as a pivotal model in computer vision and multimodal learning,
achieving state-of-the-art performance at aligning visual and textual
representations through contrastive learning. However, CLIP struggles with
potential information misalignment in many image-text datasets and suffers from
entangled representation. On the one hand, short captions for a single image in
datasets like MSCOCO may describe disjoint regions in the image, leaving the
model uncertain about which visual features to retain or disregard. On the
other hand, directly aligning long captions with images can lead to the
retention of entangled details, preventing the model from learning
disentangled, atomic concepts -- ultimately limiting its generalization on
certain downstream tasks involving short prompts.
  In this paper, we establish theoretical conditions that enable flexible
alignment between textual and visual representations across varying levels of
granularity. Specifically, our framework ensures that a model can not only
\emph{preserve} cross-modal semantic information in its entirety but also
\emph{disentangle} visual representations to capture fine-grained textual
concepts. Building on this foundation, we introduce \ours, a novel approach
that identifies and aligns the most relevant visual and textual representations
in a modular manner. Superior performance across various tasks demonstrates its
capability to handle information misalignment and supports our identification
theory. The code is available at https://github.com/Mid-Push/SmartCLIP.

### [8] [HOG-CNN: Integrating Histogram of Oriented Gradients with Convolutional Neural Networks for Retinal Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22274)
*Faisal Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于HOG-CNN混合特征提取模型的自动化临床决策支持框架，用于视网膜疾病的早期检测，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视网膜疾病诊断依赖人工，耗时耗力，需要自动化且可解释的解决方案。

Method: 结合手工HOG特征与深度CNN特征，构建HOG-CNN模型，在多个公开数据集上测试。

Result: 模型在DR、AMD和青光眼检测中表现优异，准确率和AUC值均高于现有方法。

Conclusion: HOG-CNN是一种轻量级、可解释且高效的视网膜疾病筛查工具，适合资源有限的环境。

Abstract: The analysis of fundus images is critical for the early detection and
diagnosis of retinal diseases such as Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), Glaucoma, and
Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Traditional diagnostic workflows,
however, often depend on manual interpretation and are both time- and
resource-intensive. To address these limitations, we propose an automated and
interpretable clinical decision support framework based on a hybrid feature
extraction model called HOG-CNN. Our key contribution lies in the integration
of handcrafted Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features with deep
convolutional neural network (CNN) representations. This fusion enables our
model to capture both local texture patterns and high-level semantic features
from retinal fundus images. We evaluated our model on three public benchmark
datasets: APTOS 2019 (for binary and multiclass DR classification), ORIGA (for
Glaucoma detection), and IC-AMD (for AMD diagnosis); HOG-CNN demonstrates
consistently high performance. It achieves 98.5\% accuracy and 99.2 AUC for
binary DR classification, and 94.2 AUC for five-class DR classification. On the
IC-AMD dataset, it attains 92.8\% accuracy, 94.8\% precision, and 94.5 AUC,
outperforming several state-of-the-art models. For Glaucoma detection on ORIGA,
our model achieves 83.9\% accuracy and 87.2 AUC, showing competitive
performance despite dataset limitations. We show, through comprehensive
appendix studies, the complementary strength of combining HOG and CNN features.
The model's lightweight and interpretable design makes it particularly suitable
for deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments. These results
position HOG-CNN as a robust and scalable tool for automated retinal disease
screening.

TL;DR: AlphaEarth Foundations提出了一种通用的地理空间表示方法，通过嵌入场模型整合多源数据，显著提升了地图和监测系统的准确性与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地球观测数据量大但高质量标签稀缺，传统建模方法效率低，需要一种更通用的解决方案。

Method: 采用嵌入场模型，整合空间、时间和测量上下文的多源数据，生成通用的地理空间表示。

Result: 生成的嵌入在所有测试的多样化地图评估中均优于之前的方法，且无需重新训练。

Conclusion: AlphaEarth Foundations提供了一种高效、通用的地理空间表示方法，将发布2017-2024年的全球年度嵌入场数据集。

Abstract: Unprecedented volumes of Earth observation data are continually collected
around the world, but high-quality labels remain scarce given the effort
required to make physical measurements and observations. This has led to
considerable investment in bespoke modeling efforts translating sparse labels
into maps. Here we introduce AlphaEarth Foundations, an embedding field model
yielding a highly general, geospatial representation that assimilates spatial,
temporal, and measurement contexts across multiple sources, enabling accurate
and efficient production of maps and monitoring systems from local to global
scales. The embeddings generated by AlphaEarth Foundations are the only to
consistently outperform all previous featurization approaches tested on a
diverse set of mapping evaluations without re-training. We will release a
dataset of global, annual, analysis-ready embedding field layers from 2017
through 2024.

*Chi Ding,Qingchao Zhang,Ge Wang,Xiaojing Ye,Yunmei Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种可学习的变分模型（LAMA），用于图像重建，结合了图像和测量域的信息，并证明了其收敛性。进一步提出了LAMA-Net和iLAMA-Net，实验表明其性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图像重建中非凸非光滑优化问题，并提供一个具有严格收敛证明的算法。

Method: 提出LAMA算法，结合残差学习和近端交替框架，并扩展为LAMA-Net和iLAMA-Net。

Result: LAMA-Net表现出优异的稳定性和鲁棒性，iLAMA-Net进一步提升了性能。

Conclusion: LAMA及其衍生网络在稀疏视图CT重建中优于现有方法。

Abstract: We propose a learnable variational model that learns the features and
leverages complementary information from both image and measurement domains for
image reconstruction. In particular, we introduce a learned alternating
minimization algorithm (LAMA) from our prior work, which tackles two-block
nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problems by incorporating a residual
learning architecture in a proximal alternating framework. In this work, our
goal is to provide a complete and rigorous convergence proof of LAMA and show
that all accumulation points of a specified subsequence of LAMA must be Clarke
stationary points of the problem. LAMA directly yields a highly interpretable
neural network architecture called LAMA-Net. Notably, in addition to the
results shown in our prior work, we demonstrate that the convergence property
of LAMA yields outstanding stability and robustness of LAMA-Net in this work.
We also show that the performance of LAMA-Net can be further improved by
integrating a properly designed network that generates suitable initials, which
we call iLAMA-Net. To evaluate LAMA-Net/iLAMA-Net, we conduct several
experiments and compare them with several state-of-the-art methods on popular
benchmark datasets for Sparse-View Computed Tomography.

### [11] [Learning from Heterogeneous Structural MRI via Collaborative Domain Adaptation for Late-Life Depression Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22321)
*Yuzhen Gao,Qianqian Wang,Yongheng Sun,Cui Wang,Yongquan Liang,Mingxia Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种协作域适应（CDA）框架，结合Vision Transformer（ViT）和CNN，用于基于MRI的晚年抑郁症（LLD）检测，解决了样本量小和域异质性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的LLD检测方法受限于小样本量和域异质性（如成像协议、扫描硬件和人口统计差异），影响模型的可靠性和泛化能力。

Method: CDA框架分三阶段：1）源数据监督训练；2）自监督目标特征适应；3）未标记目标数据协作训练，结合ViT和CNN提取全局与局部特征。

Result: 在多站点T1加权MRI数据上的实验表明，CDA优于现有无监督域适应方法。

Conclusion: CDA通过协作训练和特征适应，显著提升了LLD检测的域适应能力和泛化性能。

Abstract: Accurate identification of late-life depression (LLD) using structural brain
MRI is essential for monitoring disease progression and facilitating timely
intervention. However, existing learning-based approaches for LLD detection are
often constrained by limited sample sizes (e.g., tens), which poses significant
challenges for reliable model training and generalization. Although
incorporating auxiliary datasets can expand the training set, substantial
domain heterogeneity, such as differences in imaging protocols, scanner
hardware, and population demographics, often undermines cross-domain
transferability. To address this issue, we propose a Collaborative Domain
Adaptation (CDA) framework for LLD detection using T1-weighted MRIs. The CDA
leverages a Vision Transformer (ViT) to capture global anatomical context and a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract local structural features, with
each branch comprising an encoder and a classifier. The CDA framework consists
of three stages: (a) supervised training on labeled source data, (b)
self-supervised target feature adaptation and (c) collaborative training on
unlabeled target data. We first train ViT and CNN on source data, followed by
self-supervised target feature adaptation by minimizing the discrepancy between
classifier outputs from two branches to make the categorical boundary clearer.
The collaborative training stage employs pseudo-labeled and augmented
target-domain MRIs, enforcing prediction consistency under strong and weak
augmentation to enhance domain robustness and generalization. Extensive
experiments conducted on multi-site T1-weighted MRI data demonstrate that the
CDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation
methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了ACTIVE数据集和ACTIVE-PC方法，用于解决自然人机交互（N-HRI）中动作识别的复杂性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动作识别基准无法满足N-HRI的独特需求，如多距离、多状态和机器人运动中的识别。

Method: 提出ACTIVE数据集（包含30类动作、80名参与者的46,868个视频实例）和ACTIVE-PC方法（使用多级邻域采样和弹性椭圆查询等技术）。

Result: 实验证明ACTIVE-PC在长距离动作识别中有效。

Conclusion: ACTIVE数据集和方法为N-HRI中的动作识别研究提供了新基准。

Abstract: Natural Human-Robot Interaction (N-HRI) requires robots to recognize human
actions at varying distances and states, regardless of whether the robot itself
is in motion or stationary. This setup is more flexible and practical than
conventional human action recognition tasks. However, existing benchmarks
designed for traditional action recognition fail to address the unique
complexities in N-HRI due to limited data, modalities, task categories, and
diversity of subjects and environments. To address these challenges, we
introduce ACTIVE (Action from Robotic View), a large-scale dataset tailored
specifically for perception-centric robotic views prevalent in mobile service
robots. ACTIVE comprises 30 composite action categories, 80 participants, and
46,868 annotated video instances, covering both RGB and point cloud modalities.
Participants performed various human actions in diverse environments at
distances ranging from 3m to 50m, while the camera platform was also mobile,
simulating real-world scenarios of robot perception with varying camera heights
due to uneven ground. This comprehensive and challenging benchmark aims to
advance action and attribute recognition research in N-HRI. Furthermore, we
propose ACTIVE-PC, a method that accurately perceives human actions at long
distances using Multilevel Neighborhood Sampling, Layered Recognizers, Elastic
Ellipse Query, and precise decoupling of kinematic interference from human
actions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ACTIVE-PC. Our
code is available at:

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需姿态、前馈的3D高斯溅射框架，用于处理不利输入视角，通过低秩适应层和几何一致性增强模块提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖有利视角训练，限制了在未知相机姿态场景中的应用，需解决这一问题。

Method: 采用低秩适应层（LoRA）和Gaussian适配器模块，结合高斯对齐方法，利用有利图像数据集进行训练。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证了方法对不利视角的有效处理。

Conclusion: 提出的框架显著提升了3D高斯溅射模型在不利视角下的表现，扩展了其实际应用范围。

Abstract: This paper presents a pose-free, feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
framework designed to handle unfavorable input views. A common rendering setup
for training feed-forward approaches places a 3D object at the world origin and
renders it from cameras pointed toward the origin -- i.e., from favorable
views, limiting the applicability of these models to real-world scenarios
involving varying and unknown camera poses. To overcome this limitation, we
introduce a novel adaptation framework that enables pretrained pose-free
feed-forward 3DGS models to handle unfavorable views. We leverage priors
learned from favorable images by feeding recentered images into a pretrained
model augmented with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) layers. We further propose a
Gaussian adapter module to enhance the geometric consistency of the Gaussians
derived from the recentered inputs, along with a Gaussian alignment method to
render accurate target views for training. Additionally, we introduce a new
training strategy that utilizes an off-the-shelf dataset composed solely of
favorable images. Experimental results on both synthetic images from the Google
Scanned Objects dataset and real images from the OmniObject3D dataset validate
the effectiveness of our method in handling unfavorable input views.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出RSICA新范式，结合变化检测与视觉问答，支持多轮交互式遥感图像分析，并构建ChangeChat-105k数据集和DeltaVLM模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅提供一次性变化掩码或静态描述，无法支持交互式查询分析。

Method: 提出DeltaVLM模型，包含双时相视觉编码器、视觉差异感知模块和指令引导的Q-former。

Result: DeltaVLM在单轮描述和多轮交互分析中表现最优。

Conclusion: RSICA和DeltaVLM为遥感图像变化分析提供了高效交互解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of land-cover changes in multi-temporal satellite
imagery is critical for real-world scenarios. However, existing methods
typically provide only one-shot change masks or static captions, limiting their
ability to support interactive, query-driven analysis. In this work, we
introduce remote sensing image change analysis (RSICA) as a new paradigm that
combines the strengths of change detection and visual question answering to
enable multi-turn, instruction-guided exploration of changes in bi-temporal
remote sensing images. To support this task, we construct ChangeChat-105k, a
large-scale instruction-following dataset, generated through a hybrid
rule-based and GPT-assisted process, covering six interaction types: change
captioning, classification, quantification, localization, open-ended question
answering, and multi-turn dialogues. Building on this dataset, we propose
DeltaVLM, an end-to-end architecture tailored for interactive RSICA. DeltaVLM
features three innovations: (1) a fine-tuned bi-temporal vision encoder to
capture temporal differences; (2) a visual difference perception module with a
cross-semantic relation measuring (CSRM) mechanism to interpret changes; and
(3) an instruction-guided Q-former to effectively extract query-relevant
difference information from visual changes, aligning them with textual
instructions. We train DeltaVLM on ChangeChat-105k using a frozen large
language model, adapting only the vision and alignment modules to optimize
efficiency. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that
DeltaVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on both single-turn captioning
and multi-turn interactive change analysis, outperforming existing multimodal
large language models and remote sensing vision-language models. Code, dataset
and pre-trained weights are available at https://github.com/hanlinwu/DeltaVLM.

*Yunseok Oh,Dong-Wan Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种广义人脸发现（GFD）任务，结合传统人脸识别与广义类别发现（GCD），并提出了FaceGCD方法，通过动态构建实例特定特征提取器，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推动人脸识别系统向开放世界发展，实现同时识别已知和发现未知身份的能力。

Method: 提出FaceGCD方法，利用轻量级层前缀动态构建特征提取器，通过HyperNetwork自适应生成前缀。

Result: FaceGCD在GFD任务中显著优于现有GCD方法和ArcFace基线，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: FaceGCD为开放世界人脸识别提供了有效解决方案，推动了AGI的发展。

Abstract: Recognizing and differentiating among both familiar and unfamiliar faces is a
critical capability for face recognition systems and a key step toward
artificial general intelligence (AGI). Motivated by this ability, this paper
introduces generalized face discovery (GFD), a novel open-world face
recognition task that unifies traditional face identification with generalized
category discovery (GCD). GFD requires recognizing both labeled and unlabeled
known identities (IDs) while simultaneously discovering new, previously unseen
IDs. Unlike typical GCD settings, GFD poses unique challenges due to the high
cardinality and fine-grained nature of face IDs, rendering existing GCD
approaches ineffective. To tackle this problem, we propose FaceGCD, a method
that dynamically constructs instance-specific feature extractors using
lightweight, layer-wise prefixes. These prefixes are generated on the fly by a
HyperNetwork, which adaptively outputs a set of prefix generators conditioned
on each input image. This dynamic design enables FaceGCD to capture subtle
identity-specific cues without relying on high-capacity static models.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that FaceGCD significantly outperforms
existing GCD methods and a strong face recognition baseline, ArcFace, achieving
state-of-the-art results on the GFD task and advancing toward open-world face
recognition.

Abstract: To address the larger computation and storage requirements associated with
large video datasets, video dataset distillation aims to capture spatial and
temporal information in a significantly smaller dataset, such that training on
the distilled data has comparable performance to training on all of the data.
We propose GVD: Guiding Video Diffusion, the first diffusion-based video
distillation method. GVD jointly distills spatial and temporal features,
ensuring high-fidelity video generation across diverse actions while capturing
essential motion information. Our method's diverse yet representative
distillations significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art approaches on
the MiniUCF and HMDB51 datasets across 5, 10, and 20 Instances Per Class (IPC).
Specifically, our method achieves 78.29 percent of the original dataset's
performance using only 1.98 percent of the total number of frames in MiniUCF.
Additionally, it reaches 73.83 percent of the performance with just 3.30
percent of the frames in HMDB51. Experimental results across benchmark video
datasets demonstrate that GVD not only achieves state-of-the-art performance
but can also generate higher resolution videos and higher IPC without
significantly increasing computational cost.

Result: 在VGAF-GEMS基准上，GEMS框架在定量和定性比较中表现出色。

Conclusion: GEMS框架为未来研究提供了新方向，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Understanding individual, group and event level emotions along with
contextual information is crucial for analyzing a multi-person social
situation. To achieve this, we frame emotion comprehension as the task of
predicting fine-grained individual emotion to coarse grained group and event
level emotion. We introduce GEMS that leverages a multimodal swin-transformer
and S3Attention based architecture, which processes an input scene, group
members, and context information to generate joint predictions. Existing
multi-person emotion related benchmarks mainly focus on atomic interactions
primarily based on emotion perception over time and group level. To this end,
we extend and propose VGAF-GEMS to provide more fine grained and holistic
analysis on top of existing group level annotation of VGAF dataset. GEMS aims
to predict basic discrete and continuous emotions (including valence and
arousal) as well as individual, group and event level perceived emotions. Our
benchmarking effort links individual, group and situational emotional responses
holistically. The quantitative and qualitative comparisons with adapted
state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of GEMS framework on
VGAF-GEMS benchmarking. We believe that it will pave the way of further
research. The code and data is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示VLM在频率域扰动下的脆弱性，挑战其可靠性。

Method: 设计频率域的目标图像变换，测试五种先进VLM。

Result: VLM输出对频率扰动敏感，与语义内容不完全一致。

Conclusion: VLM在多模态感知任务中需更鲁棒的设计。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly used as perceptual modules for
visual content reasoning, including through captioning and DeepFake detection.
In this work, we expose a critical vulnerability of VLMs when exposed to
subtle, structured perturbations in the frequency domain. Specifically, we
highlight how these feature transformations undermine authenticity/DeepFake
detection and automated image captioning tasks. We design targeted image
transformations, operating in the frequency domain to systematically adjust VLM
outputs when exposed to frequency-perturbed real and synthetic images. We
demonstrate that the perturbation injection method generalizes across five
state-of-the-art VLMs which includes different-parameter Qwen2/2.5 and BLIP
models. Experimenting across ten real and generated image datasets reveals that
VLM judgments are sensitive to frequency-based cues and may not wholly align
with semantic content. Crucially, we show that visually-imperceptible spatial
frequency transformations expose the fragility of VLMs deployed for automated
image captioning and authenticity detection tasks. Our findings under
realistic, black-box constraints challenge the reliability of VLMs,
underscoring the need for robust multimodal perception systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MAE对掩码策略敏感及在分布外数据上性能下降的问题。

Result: MINR在域内和域外场景均优于MAE，同时降低模型复杂度。

Conclusion: MINR是现有框架的鲁棒高效替代方案，适用于多种自监督学习任务。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning methods like masked autoencoders (MAE) have shown
significant promise in learning robust feature representations, particularly in
image reconstruction-based pretraining task. However, their performance is
often strongly dependent on the masking strategies used during training and can
degrade when applied to out-of-distribution data. To address these limitations,
we introduce the masked implicit neural representations (MINR) framework that
synergizes implicit neural representations with masked image modeling. MINR
learns a continuous function to represent images, enabling more robust and
generalizable reconstructions irrespective of masking strategies. Our
experiments demonstrate that MINR not only outperforms MAE in in-domain
scenarios but also in out-of-distribution settings, while reducing model
complexity. The versatility of MINR extends to various self-supervised learning
applications, confirming its utility as a robust and efficient alternative to
existing frameworks.

Conclusion: MZNet是高效实用的摩尔纹去除解决方案。

Abstract: Moir\'e patterns, caused by frequency aliasing between fine repetitive
structures and a camera sensor's sampling process, have been a significant
obstacle in various real-world applications, such as consumer photography and
industrial defect inspection. With the advancements in deep learning
algorithms, numerous studies-predominantly based on convolutional neural
networks-have suggested various solutions to address this issue. Despite these
efforts, existing approaches still struggle to effectively eliminate artifacts
due to the diverse scales, orientations, and color shifts of moir\'e patterns,
primarily because the constrained receptive field of CNN-based architectures
limits their ability to capture the complex characteristics of moir\'e
patterns. In this paper, we propose MZNet, a U-shaped network designed to bring
images closer to a 'Moire-Zero' state by effectively removing moir\'e patterns.
It integrates three specialized components: Multi-Scale Dual Attention Block
(MSDAB) for extracting and refining multi-scale features, Multi-Shape Large
Kernel Convolution Block (MSLKB) for capturing diverse moir\'e structures, and
Feature Fusion-Based Skip Connection for enhancing information flow. Together,
these components enhance local texture restoration and large-scale artifact
suppression. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MZNet achieves
state-of-the-art performance on high-resolution datasets and delivers
competitive results on lower-resolution dataset, while maintaining a low
computational cost, suggesting that it is an efficient and practical solution
for real-world applications. Project page:

Conclusion: UAVScenes填补了多模态无人机数据集的空白，为高级场景理解任务提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Multi-modal perception is essential for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
operations, as it enables a comprehensive understanding of the UAVs'
surrounding environment. However, most existing multi-modal UAV datasets are
primarily biased toward localization and 3D reconstruction tasks, or only
support map-level semantic segmentation due to the lack of frame-wise
annotations for both camera images and LiDAR point clouds. This limitation
prevents them from being used for high-level scene understanding tasks. To
address this gap and advance multi-modal UAV perception, we introduce
UAVScenes, a large-scale dataset designed to benchmark various tasks across
both 2D and 3D modalities. Our benchmark dataset is built upon the
well-calibrated multi-modal UAV dataset MARS-LVIG, originally developed only
for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). We enhance this dataset by
providing manually labeled semantic annotations for both frame-wise images and
LiDAR point clouds, along with accurate 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) poses.
These additions enable a wide range of UAV perception tasks, including
segmentation, depth estimation, 6-DoF localization, place recognition, and
novel view synthesis (NVS). Our dataset is available at

Conclusion: 该方法有效捕捉边界模糊区域的不确定性，提供更可靠的分割结果。

Abstract: Quantifying aleatoric uncertainty in medical image segmentation is critical
since it is a reflection of the natural variability observed among expert
annotators. A conventional approach is to model the segmentation distribution
using the generative model, but current methods limit the expression ability of
generative models. While current diffusion-based approaches have demonstrated
impressive performance in approximating the data distribution, their inherent
stochastic sampling process and inability to model exact densities limit their
effectiveness in accurately capturing uncertainty. In contrast, our proposed
method leverages conditional flow matching, a simulation-free flow-based
generative model that learns an exact density, to produce highly accurate
segmentation results. By guiding the flow model on the input image and sampling
multiple data points, our approach synthesizes segmentation samples whose
pixel-wise variance reliably reflects the underlying data distribution. This
sampling strategy captures uncertainties in regions with ambiguous boundaries,
offering robust quantification that mirrors inter-annotator differences.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only achieves competitive
segmentation accuracy but also generates uncertainty maps that provide deeper
insights into the reliability of the segmentation outcomes. The code for this

Abstract: Large-scale but noisy image-text pair data have paved the way for the success
of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP). As the foundation vision
encoder, CLIP in turn serves as the cornerstone for most large vision-language
models (LVLMs). This interdependence naturally raises an interesting question:
Can we reciprocally leverage LVLMs to enhance the quality of image-text pair
data, thereby opening the possibility of a self-reinforcing cycle for
continuous improvement? In this work, we take a significant step toward this
vision by introducing an LVLM-driven data refinement pipeline. Our framework
leverages LVLMs to process images and their raw alt-text, generating four
complementary textual formulas: long positive descriptions, long negative
descriptions, short positive tags, and short negative tags. Applying this
pipeline to the curated DFN-Large dataset yields VLM-150M, a refined dataset
enriched with multi-grained annotations. Based on this dataset, we further
propose a training paradigm that extends conventional contrastive learning by
incorporating negative descriptions and short tags as additional supervised
signals. The resulting model, namely HQ-CLIP, demonstrates remarkable
improvements across diverse benchmarks. Within a comparable training data
scale, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot
classification, cross-modal retrieval, and fine-grained visual understanding
tasks. In retrieval benchmarks, HQ-CLIP even surpasses standard CLIP models
trained on the DFN-2B dataset, which contains 10$\times$ more training data
than ours. All code, data, and models are available at

Motivation: 运动模糊和低光条件导致传统姿态估计方法性能下降，现有数据集假设条件稳定，无法适应模糊环境。

Result: 方法在运动模糊环境下优于传统域适应方法，无需目标域标注即可实现鲁棒姿态估计。

Conclusion: 事件相机为运动模糊环境中的域适应提供了可扩展且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Human pose estimation is critical for applications such as rehabilitation,
sports analytics, and AR/VR systems. However, rapid motion and low-light
conditions often introduce motion blur, significantly degrading pose estimation
due to the domain gap between sharp and blurred images. Most datasets assume
stable conditions, making models trained on sharp images struggle in blurred
environments. To address this, we introduce a novel domain adaptation approach
that leverages event cameras, which capture high temporal resolution motion
data and are inherently robust to motion blur. Using event-based augmentation,
we generate motion-aware blurred images, effectively bridging the domain gap
between sharp and blurred domains without requiring paired annotations.
Additionally, we develop a student-teacher framework that iteratively refines
pseudo-labels, leveraging mutual uncertainty masking to eliminate incorrect
labels and enable more effective learning. Experimental results demonstrate
that our approach outperforms conventional domain-adaptive human pose
estimation methods, achieving robust pose estimation under motion blur without
requiring annotations in the target domain. Our findings highlight the
potential of event cameras as a scalable and effective solution for domain
adaptation in real-world motion blur environments. Our project codes are

Conclusion: TopoLiDM显著提升了LiDAR生成的几何真实性和拓扑一致性，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: LiDAR scene generation is critical for mitigating real-world LiDAR data
collection costs and enhancing the robustness of downstream perception tasks in
autonomous driving. However, existing methods commonly struggle to capture
geometric realism and global topological consistency. Recent LiDAR Diffusion
Models (LiDMs) predominantly embed LiDAR points into the latent space for
improved generation efficiency, which limits their interpretable ability to
model detailed geometric structures and preserve global topological
consistency. To address these challenges, we propose TopoLiDM, a novel
framework that integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) with diffusion models
under topological regularization for high-fidelity LiDAR generation. Our
approach first trains a topological-preserving VAE to extract latent graph
representations by graph construction and multiple graph convolutional layers.
Then we freeze the VAE and generate novel latent topological graphs through the
latent diffusion models. We also introduce 0-dimensional persistent homology
(PH) constraints, ensuring the generated LiDAR scenes adhere to real-world
global topological structures. Extensive experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset
demonstrate TopoLiDM's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, achieving
improvements of 22.6% lower Frechet Range Image Distance (FRID) and 9.2% lower
Minimum Matching Distance (MMD). Notably, our model also enables fast
generation speed with an average inference time of 1.68 samples/s, showcasing
its scalability for real-world applications. We will release the related codes

### [30] [Exploiting Diffusion Prior for Task-driven Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22459)
*Jaeha Kim,Junghun Oh,Kyoung Mu Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出EDTR方法，利用扩散先验恢复任务相关细节，提升多复杂退化场景下的任务性能和视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有任务驱动图像恢复方法难以处理多复杂退化场景，扩散先验虽能生成视觉合理结果，但恢复任务相关细节仍具挑战。

Method: 提出EDTR，通过从低质量图像中提取有用线索，结合轻度噪声的预恢复图像，并减少去噪步骤以避免冗余细节。

Result: EDTR显著提升了多复杂退化场景下的任务性能和视觉质量。

Conclusion: EDTR有效利用扩散先验，解决了任务驱动图像恢复中的关键问题。

Abstract: Task-driven image restoration (TDIR) has recently emerged to address
performance drops in high-level vision tasks caused by low-quality (LQ) inputs.
Previous TDIR methods struggle to handle practical scenarios in which images
are degraded by multiple complex factors, leaving minimal clues for
restoration. This motivates us to leverage the diffusion prior, one of the most
powerful natural image priors. However, while the diffusion prior can help
generate visually plausible results, using it to restore task-relevant details
remains challenging, even when combined with recent TDIR methods. To address
this, we propose EDTR, which effectively harnesses the power of diffusion prior
to restore task-relevant details. Specifically, we propose directly leveraging
useful clues from LQ images in the diffusion process by generating from
pixel-error-based pre-restored LQ images with mild noise added. Moreover, we
employ a small number of denoising steps to prevent the generation of redundant
details that dilute crucial task-related information. We demonstrate that our
method effectively utilizes diffusion prior for TDIR, significantly enhancing
task performance and visual quality across diverse tasks with multiple complex
degradations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种分层记忆架构（HMHI-Net），结合浅层和高层特征，通过异构交互机制提升无监督视频对象分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法过度依赖高层语义特征，缺乏细粒度信息，导致性能提升有限。

Method: 设计了分层记忆架构和异构交互机制（PLAM和SGIM），结合像素和语义信息。

Result: HMHI-Net在所有UVOS和视频显著性检测基准中表现最优，且对不同骨干网络具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过结合浅层和高层特征，HMHI-Net显著提升了无监督视频对象分割的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation (UVOS) aims to predict pixel-level
masks for the most salient objects in videos without any prior annotations.
While memory mechanisms have been proven critical in various video segmentation
paradigms, their application in UVOS yield only marginal performance gains
despite sophisticated design. Our analysis reveals a simple but fundamental
flaw in existing methods: over-reliance on memorizing high-level semantic
features. UVOS inherently suffers from the deficiency of lacking fine-grained
information due to the absence of pixel-level prior knowledge. Consequently,
memory design relying solely on high-level features, which predominantly
capture abstract semantic cues, is insufficient to generate precise
predictions. To resolve this fundamental issue, we propose a novel hierarchical
memory architecture to incorporate both shallow- and high-level features for
memory, which leverages the complementary benefits of pixel and semantic
information. Furthermore, to balance the simultaneous utilization of the pixel
and semantic memory features, we propose a heterogeneous interaction mechanism
to perform pixel-semantic mutual interactions, which explicitly considers their
inherent feature discrepancies. Through the design of Pixel-guided Local
Alignment Module (PLAM) and Semantic-guided Global Integration Module (SGIM),
we achieve delicate integration of the fine-grained details in shallow-level
memory and the semantic representations in high-level memory. Our Hierarchical
Memory with Heterogeneous Interaction Network (HMHI-Net) consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all UVOS and video saliency detection
benchmarks. Moreover, HMHI-Net consistently exhibits high performance across
different backbones, further demonstrating its superiority and robustness.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的零样本深度伪造检测方法，优于传统分类器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造技术（如GAN或扩散模型）对数字媒体和身份验证等系统构成威胁，现有检测方法仅依赖图像域分类器，缺乏辅助任务增强鲁棒性。

Method: 利用VLM的零样本能力进行图像分类，并在高质量深度伪造数据集（60,000张图像）上评估性能。

Result: 零样本模型表现优于现有方法，InstructBLIP架构在DFDC-P数据集上的零样本和微调场景中均优于传统分类器。

Conclusion: VLM在深度伪造检测中表现出显著优势，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: The contemporary phenomenon of deepfakes, utilizing GAN or diffusion models
for face swapping, presents a substantial and evolving threat in digital media,
identity verification, and a multitude of other systems. The majority of
existing methods for detecting deepfakes rely on training specialized
classifiers to distinguish between genuine and manipulated images, focusing
only on the image domain without incorporating any auxiliary tasks that could
enhance robustness. In this paper, inspired by the zero-shot capabilities of
Vision Language Models, we propose a novel VLM-based approach to image
classification and then evaluate it for deepfake detection. Specifically, we
utilize a new high-quality deepfake dataset comprising 60,000 images, on which
our zero-shot models demonstrate superior performance to almost all existing
methods. Subsequently, we compare the performance of the best-performing
architecture, InstructBLIP, on the popular deepfake dataset DFDC-P against
traditional methods in two scenarios: zero-shot and in-domain fine-tuning. Our
results demonstrate the superiority of VLMs over traditional classifiers.

Conclusion: LIDAR网络在多模态裂缝分割任务中实现了高效且轻量化的性能。

Abstract: Achieving pixel-level segmentation with low computational cost using
multimodal data remains a key challenge in crack segmentation tasks. Existing
methods lack the capability for adaptive perception and efficient interactive
fusion of cross-modal features. To address these challenges, we propose a
Lightweight Adaptive Cue-Aware Vision Mamba network (LIDAR), which efficiently
perceives and integrates morphological and textural cues from different
modalities under multimodal crack scenarios, generating clear pixel-level crack
segmentation maps. Specifically, LIDAR is composed of a Lightweight Adaptive
Cue-Aware Visual State Space module (LacaVSS) and a Lightweight Dual Domain
Dynamic Collaborative Fusion module (LD3CF). LacaVSS adaptively models crack
cues through the proposed mask-guided Efficient Dynamic Guided Scanning
Strategy (EDG-SS), while LD3CF leverages an Adaptive Frequency Domain
Perceptron (AFDP) and a dual-pooling fusion strategy to effectively capture
spatial and frequency-domain cues across modalities. Moreover, we design a
Lightweight Dynamically Modulated Multi-Kernel convolution (LDMK) to perceive
complex morphological structures with minimal computational overhead, replacing
most convolutional operations in LIDAR. Experiments on three datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.
On the light-field depth dataset, our method achieves 0.8204 in F1 and 0.8465
in mIoU with only 5.35M parameters. Code and datasets are available at

Conclusion: CamFlow通过混合运动基和概率损失函数，显著提升了相机运动估计的性能和通用性。

Abstract: Estimating 2D camera motion is a fundamental computer vision task that models
the projection of 3D camera movements onto the 2D image plane. Current methods
rely on either homography-based approaches, limited to planar scenes, or
meshflow techniques that use grid-based local homographies but struggle with
complex non-linear transformations. A key insight of our work is that combining
flow fields from different homographies creates motion patterns that cannot be
represented by any single homography. We introduce CamFlow, a novel framework
that represents camera motion using hybrid motion bases: physical bases derived
from camera geometry and stochastic bases for complex scenarios. Our approach
includes a hybrid probabilistic loss function based on the Laplace distribution
that enhances training robustness. For evaluation, we create a new benchmark by
masking dynamic objects in existing optical flow datasets to isolate pure
camera motion. Experiments show CamFlow outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across diverse scenarios, demonstrating superior robustness and generalization
in zero-shot settings. Code and datasets are available at our project page:

Motivation: 现有All-in-One模型难以捕捉多样化和局部化的天气退化模式，需要更有效的方法。

Method: 使用频谱分解（边缘检测和SVD）提取高低频特征，结合分组注意力和空间分组变换块，生成分组掩码并融合特征。

Result: 实验表明SSGformer在多样复杂天气退化处理中表现优越。

Conclusion: SSGformer通过频谱分解和分组注意力机制，显著提升了多天气图像恢复的性能。

Abstract: Adverse weather conditions cause diverse and complex degradation patterns,
driving the development of All-in-One (AiO) models. However, recent AiO
solutions still struggle to capture diverse degradations, since global
filtering methods like direct operations on the frequency domain fail to handle
highly variable and localized distortions. To address these issue, we propose
Spectral-based Spatial Grouping Transformer (SSGformer), a novel approach that
leverages spectral decomposition and group-wise attention for multi-weather
image restoration. SSGformer decomposes images into high-frequency edge
features using conventional edge detection and low-frequency information via
Singular Value Decomposition. We utilize multi-head linear attention to
effectively model the relationship between these features. The fused features
are integrated with the input to generate a grouping-mask that clusters regions
based on the spatial similarity and image texture. To fully leverage this mask,
we introduce a group-wise attention mechanism, enabling robust adverse weather
removal and ensuring consistent performance across diverse weather conditions.
We also propose a Spatial Grouping Transformer Block that uses both channel
attention and spatial attention, effectively balancing feature-wise
relationships and spatial dependencies. Extensive experiments show the
superiority of our approach, validating its effectiveness in handling the
varied and intricate adverse weather degradations.

Abstract: Underwater images typically suffer from severe colour distortions, low
visibility, and reduced structural clarity due to complex optical effects such
as scattering and absorption, which greatly degrade their visual quality and
limit the performance of downstream visual perception tasks. Existing
enhancement methods often struggle to adaptively handle diverse degradation
conditions and fail to leverage underwater-specific physical priors
effectively. In this paper, we propose a degradation-aware conditional
diffusion model to enhance underwater images adaptively and robustly. Given a
degraded underwater image as input, we first predict its degradation level
using a lightweight dual-stream convolutional network, generating a continuous
degradation score as semantic guidance. Based on this score, we introduce a
novel conditional diffusion-based restoration network with a Swin UNet
backbone, enabling adaptive noise scheduling and hierarchical feature
refinement. To incorporate underwater-specific physical priors, we further
propose a degradation-guided adaptive feature fusion module and a hybrid loss
function that combines perceptual consistency, histogram matching, and
feature-level contrast. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method effectively restores underwater images with
superior colour fidelity, perceptual quality, and structural details. Compared
with SOTA approaches, our framework achieves significant improvements in both
quantitative metrics and qualitative visual assessments.

Abstract: The segmentation of the hepatic vasculature in surgical videos holds
substantial clinical significance in the context of hepatectomy procedures.
However, owing to the dearth of an appropriate dataset and the inherently
complex task characteristics, few researches have been reported in this domain.
To address this issue, we first introduce a high quality frame-by-frame
annotated hepatic vasculature dataset containing 35 long hepatectomy videos and
11442 high-resolution frames. On this basis, we propose a novel high-resolution
video vasculature segmentation network, dubbed as HRVVS. We innovatively embed
a pretrained visual autoregressive modeling (VAR) model into different layers
of the hierarchical encoder as prior information to reduce the information
degradation generated during the downsampling process. In addition, we designed
a dynamic memory decoder on a multi-view segmentation network to minimize the
transmission of redundant information while preserving more details between
frames. Extensive experiments on surgical video datasets demonstrate that our
proposed HRVVS significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. The

Conclusion: 该方法通过动态演化提示，显著提升了持续学习中的任务适应能力。

Abstract: Prompt-based continual learning provides a rehearsal-free solution by tuning
small sets of parameters while keeping pre-trained models frozen. To meet the
complex demands of sequential tasks, it is crucial to integrate task-specific
knowledge within prompts effectively. However, existing works rely on either
fixed learned prompts (i.e., prompts whose representations remain unchanged
during new task learning) or on prompts generated from an entangled task-shared
space, limiting the representational diversity of the integrated prompt. To
address this issue, we propose a novel prompt-evolving mechanism to adaptively
aggregate base prompts (i.e., task-specific prompts) into a unified prompt
while ensuring diversity. By transforming and aligning base prompts, both
previously learned and newly introduced, our approach continuously evolves
accumulated knowledge to facilitate learning new tasks. We further introduce a
learnable probabilistic gate that adaptively determines which layers to
activate during the evolution process. We validate our method on image
classification and video action recognition tasks in class-incremental
learning, achieving average gains of 9.07% and 7.40% over existing methods
across all scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate identification of breast lesion subtypes can facilitate personalized
treatment and interventions. Ultrasound (US), as a safe and accessible imaging
modality, is extensively employed in breast abnormality screening and
diagnosis. However, the incidence of different subtypes exhibits a skewed
long-tailed distribution, posing significant challenges for automated
recognition. Generative augmentation provides a promising solution to rectify
data distribution. Inspired by this, we propose a dual-phase framework for
long-tailed classification that mitigates distributional bias through
high-fidelity data synthesis while avoiding overuse that corrupts holistic
performance. The framework incorporates a reinforcement learning-driven
adaptive sampler, dynamically calibrating synthetic-real data ratios by
training a strategic multi-agent to compensate for scarcities of real data
while ensuring stable discriminative capability. Furthermore, our
class-controllable synthetic network integrates a sketch-grounded perception
branch that harnesses anatomical priors to maintain distinctive class features
while enabling annotation-free inference. Extensive experiments on an in-house
long-tailed and a public imbalanced breast US datasets demonstrate that our
method achieves promising performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Motivation: OOD检测性能受限于单一分类器的能力，需要一种更灵活的方法来提升检测效果。

Method: 通过异构集成三种分类器（封闭世界分类器、零样本CLIP分类器和线性探测分类器），实现模块化和后处理的OOD检测。

Result: 在CIFAR100和ImageNet等基准测试中，COOkeD实现了最先进的性能，并表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: COOkeD通过简单但有效的异构集成方法，显著提升了OOD检测的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is an important building block in
trustworthy image recognition systems as unknown classes may arise at
test-time. OOD detection methods typically revolve around a single classifier,
leading to a split in the research field between the classical supervised
setting (e.g. ResNet18 classifier trained on CIFAR100) vs. the zero-shot
setting (class names fed as prompts to CLIP). In both cases, an overarching
challenge is that the OOD detection performance is implicitly constrained by
the classifier's capabilities on in-distribution (ID) data. In this work, we
show that given a little open-mindedness from both ends, remarkable OOD
detection can be achieved by instead creating a heterogeneous ensemble - COOkeD
combines the predictions of a closed-world classifier trained end-to-end on a
specific dataset, a zero-shot CLIP classifier, and a linear probe classifier
trained on CLIP image features. While bulky at first sight, this approach is
modular, post-hoc and leverages the availability of pre-trained VLMs, thus
introduces little overhead compared to training a single standard classifier.
We evaluate COOkeD on popular CIFAR100 and ImageNet benchmarks, but also
consider more challenging, realistic settings ranging from training-time label
noise, to test-time covariate shift, to zero-shot shift which has been
previously overlooked. Despite its simplicity, COOkeD achieves state-of-the-art
performance and greater robustness compared to both classical and CLIP-based
OOD detection methods. Code is available at https://github.com/glhr/COOkeD

Abstract: In this paper, we present a deepfake detection algorithm specifically
designed for electronic Know Your Customer (eKYC) systems. To ensure the
reliability of eKYC systems against deepfake attacks, it is essential to
develop a robust deepfake detector capable of identifying both face swapping
and face reenactment, while also being robust to image degradation. We address
these challenges through three key contributions: (1)~Our approach evaluates
the video's authenticity by detecting temporal inconsistencies in identity
vectors extracted by face recognition models, leading to comprehensive
detection of both face swapping and face reenactment. (2)~In addition to
processing video input, the algorithm utilizes a registered image (assumed to
be genuine) to calculate identity discrepancies between the input video and the
registered image, significantly improving detection accuracy. (3)~We find that
employing a face feature extractor trained on a larger dataset enhances both
detection performance and robustness against image degradation. Our
experimental results show that our proposed method accurately detects both face
swapping and face reenactment comprehensively and is robust against various
forms of unseen image degradation. Our source code is publicly available

Result: 该方法显著提高了对齐性能，超越了现有最佳方法。

Conclusion: ShortFT是一种高效且有效的微调策略，适用于多种奖励函数。

Abstract: Backpropagation-based approaches aim to align diffusion models with reward
functions through end-to-end backpropagation of the reward gradient within the
denoising chain, offering a promising perspective. However, due to the
computational costs and the risk of gradient explosion associated with the
lengthy denoising chain, existing approaches struggle to achieve complete
gradient backpropagation, leading to suboptimal results. In this paper, we
introduce Shortcut-based Fine-Tuning (ShortFT), an efficient fine-tuning
strategy that utilizes the shorter denoising chain. More specifically, we
employ the recently researched trajectory-preserving few-step diffusion model,
which enables a shortcut over the original denoising chain, and construct a
shortcut-based denoising chain of shorter length. The optimization on this
chain notably enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of fine-tuning the
foundational model. Our method has been rigorously tested and can be
effectively applied to various reward functions, significantly improving
alignment performance and surpassing state-of-the-art alternatives.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has proven its effectiveness in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of large language models. Recent research efforts have
progressively extended this paradigm to multimodal reasoning tasks. Due to the
inherent complexity and diversity of multimodal tasks, especially in semantic
content and problem formulations, existing models often exhibit unstable
performance across various domains and difficulty levels. To address these
limitations, we propose VL-Cogito, an advanced multimodal reasoning model
trained via a novel multi-stage Progressive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning
(PCuRL) framework. PCuRL systematically guides the model through tasks of
gradually increasing difficulty, substantially improving its reasoning
abilities across diverse multimodal contexts. The framework introduces two key
innovations: (1) an online difficulty soft weighting mechanism, dynamically
adjusting training difficulty across successive RL training stages; and (2) a
dynamic length reward mechanism, which encourages the model to adaptively
regulate its reasoning path length according to task complexity, thus balancing
reasoning efficiency with correctness. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that VL-Cogito consistently matches or surpasses existing reasoning-oriented
models across mainstream multimodal benchmarks spanning mathematics, science,
logic, and general understanding, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GALTraj的生成式主动学习方法，用于改进轨迹预测模型在长尾场景中的表现，通过可控扩散模型增强训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有数据驱动的轨迹预测模型在罕见长尾场景中表现不佳的问题，而无需改变模型结构。

Method: 引入GALTraj方法，主动识别模型失败的罕见样本，并用可控扩散模型生成多样、真实且保留长尾特性的轨迹数据。

Result: 在多个数据集（WOMD、Argoverse2）和模型（QCNet、MTR）上验证，显著提升长尾样本性能，同时提高头部样本准确率。

Conclusion: GALTraj首次将生成式主动学习应用于轨迹预测，展示了模拟驱动增强对长尾学习的益处。

Abstract: While data-driven trajectory prediction has enhanced the reliability of
autonomous driving systems, it still struggles with rarely observed long-tail
scenarios. Prior works addressed this by modifying model architectures, such as
using hypernetworks. In contrast, we propose refining the training process to
unlock each model's potential without altering its structure. We introduce
Generative Active Learning for Trajectory prediction (GALTraj), the first
method to successfully deploy generative active learning into trajectory
prediction. It actively identifies rare tail samples where the model fails and
augments these samples with a controllable diffusion model during training. In
our framework, generating scenarios that are diverse, realistic, and preserve
tail-case characteristics is paramount. Accordingly, we design a tail-aware
generation method that applies tailored diffusion guidance to generate
trajectories that both capture rare behaviors and respect traffic rules. Unlike
prior simulation methods focused solely on scenario diversity, GALTraj is the
first to show how simulator-driven augmentation benefits long-tail learning in
trajectory prediction. Experiments on multiple trajectory datasets (WOMD,
Argoverse2) with popular backbones (QCNet, MTR) confirm that our method
significantly boosts performance on tail samples and also enhances accuracy on
head samples.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable brain tumor segmentation, particularly when dealing
with missing modalities, remains a critical challenge in medical image
analysis. Previous studies have not fully resolved the challenges of tumor
boundary segmentation insensitivity and feature transfer in the absence of key
imaging modalities. In this study, we introduce MST-KDNet, aimed at addressing
these critical issues. Our model features Multi-Scale Transformer Knowledge
Distillation to effectively capture attention weights at various resolutions,
Dual-Mode Logit Distillation to improve the transfer of knowledge, and a Global
Style Matching Module that integrates feature matching with adversarial
learning. Comprehensive experiments conducted on the BraTS and FeTS 2024
datasets demonstrate that MST-KDNet surpasses current leading methods in both
Dice and HD95 scores, particularly in conditions with substantial modality
loss. Our approach shows exceptional robustness and generalization potential,
making it a promising candidate for real-world clinical applications. Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时尚设计需要结合视觉草图与文本描述，现有方法难以同时处理局部和全局信息，LOTS旨在解决这一问题。

Method: LOTS采用模块化对中心表示将草图与文本编码到共享潜在空间，并通过扩散对引导阶段结合局部与全局条件。

Result: LOTS在全局和局部指标上均达到最优性能，并通过定性分析和用户评估验证了其设计定制能力。

Conclusion: LOTS为时尚图像生成提供了高效且定制化的解决方案，显著提升了生成质量与灵活性。

Abstract: Fashion design is a complex creative process that blends visual and textual
expressions. Designers convey ideas through sketches, which define spatial
structure and design elements, and textual descriptions, capturing material,
texture, and stylistic details. In this paper, we present LOcalized Text and
Sketch for fashion image generation (LOTS), an approach for compositional
sketch-text based generation of complete fashion outlooks. LOTS leverages a
global description with paired localized sketch + text information for
conditioning and introduces a novel step-based merging strategy for diffusion
adaptation. First, a Modularized Pair-Centric representation encodes sketches
and text into a shared latent space while preserving independent localized
features; then, a Diffusion Pair Guidance phase integrates both local and
global conditioning via attention-based guidance within the diffusion model's
multi-step denoising process. To validate our method, we build on Fashionpedia
to release Sketchy, the first fashion dataset where multiple text-sketch pairs
are provided per image. Quantitative results show LOTS achieves
state-of-the-art image generation performance on both global and localized
metrics, while qualitative examples and a human evaluation study highlight its
unprecedented level of design customization.

Abstract: The proliferation of drones in civilian airspace has raised urgent security
concerns, necessitating robust real-time surveillance systems. In response to
the 2025 VIP Cup challenge tasks - drone detection, tracking, and payload
identification - we propose a dual-stream drone monitoring framework. Our
approach deploys independent You Only Look Once v11-nano (YOLOv11n) object
detectors on parallel infrared (thermal) and visible (RGB) data streams,
deliberately avoiding early fusion. This separation allows each model to be
specifically optimized for the distinct characteristics of its input modality,
addressing the unique challenges posed by small aerial objects in diverse
environmental conditions. We customize data preprocessing and augmentation
strategies per domain - such as limiting color jitter for IR imagery - and
fine-tune training hyperparameters to enhance detection performance under
conditions of heavy noise, low light, and motion blur. The resulting
lightweight YOLOv11n models demonstrate high accuracy in distinguishing drones
from birds and in classifying payload types, all while maintaining real-time
performance. This report details the rationale for a dual-modality design, the
specialized training pipelines, and the architectural optimizations that
collectively enable efficient and accurate drone surveillance across RGB and IR
channels.

Abstract: 3D point cloud segmentation aims to assign semantic labels to individual
points in a scene for fine-grained spatial understanding. Existing methods
typically adopt data augmentation to alleviate the burden of large-scale
annotation. However, most augmentation strategies only focus on local
transformations or semantic recomposition, lacking the consideration of global
structural dependencies within scenes. To address this limitation, we propose a
graph-guided data augmentation framework with dual-level constraints for
realistic 3D scene synthesis. Our method learns object relationship statistics
from real-world data to construct guiding graphs for scene generation.
Local-level constraints enforce geometric plausibility and semantic consistency
between objects, while global-level constraints maintain the topological
structure of the scene by aligning the generated layout with the guiding graph.
Extensive experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate that our
framework generates diverse and high-quality augmented scenes, leading to
consistent improvements in point cloud segmentation performance across various
models.

images collected over six months from five diverse plant species in both
controlled and outdoor field environments. We provide detailed benchmarks using

Result: 在CelebA数据集上训练的单一模型表现优异，部分基准测试接近完美性能。

Conclusion: 扩散模型在异常检测中表现出强大潜力，未来有进一步优化的空间。

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs is pivotal for deploying safe
vision systems in open-world environments. We revisit diffusion models, not as
generators, but as universal perceptual templates for OOD detection. This
research explores the use of score-based generative models as foundational
tools for semantic anomaly detection across unseen datasets. Specifically, we
leverage the denoising trajectories of Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs) as a
rich source of texture and semantic information. By analyzing Stein score
errors, amplified through the Structural Similarity Index Metric (SSIM), we
introduce a novel method for identifying anomalous samples without requiring
re-training on each target dataset. Our approach improves over state-of-the-art
and relies on training a single model on one dataset -- CelebA -- which we find
to be an effective base distribution, even outperforming more commonly used
datasets like ImageNet in several settings. Experimental results show
near-perfect performance on some benchmarks, with notable headroom on others,
highlighting both the strength and future potential of generative foundation
models in anomaly detection.

Motivation: 传统SfT方法需要图像与3D模板的点对应关系，性能在严重遮挡时下降；现代方法依赖大量监督数据。本文旨在开发一种无需对应关系且无需监督数据的高效方法。

Method: 结合图像观测（颜色、梯度、轮廓）和网格不可扩展性约束，采用无监督方式重建3D形状。

Result: 方法比现有最佳无监督SfT快400倍，且在细节和严重遮挡情况下表现更优。

Conclusion: 提出的无监督SfT方法高效且鲁棒，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: Shape-from-Template (SfT) refers to the class of methods that reconstruct the
3D shape of a deforming object from images/videos using a 3D template.
Traditional SfT methods require point correspondences between images and the
texture of the 3D template in order to reconstruct 3D shapes from images/videos
in real time. Their performance severely degrades when encountered with severe
occlusions in the images because of the unavailability of correspondences. In
contrast, modern SfT methods use a correspondence-free approach by
incorporating deep neural networks to reconstruct 3D objects, thus requiring
huge amounts of data for supervision. Recent advances use a fully unsupervised
or self-supervised approach by combining differentiable physics and graphics to
deform 3D template to match input images. In this paper, we propose an
unsupervised SfT which uses only image observations: color features, gradients
and silhouettes along with a mesh inextensibility constraint to reconstruct at
a $400\times$ faster pace than (best-performing) unsupervised SfT. Moreover,
when it comes to generating finer details and severe occlusions, our method
outperforms the existing methodologies by a large margin. Code is available at

Abstract: Structure and continuous motion estimation from point correspondences is a
fundamental problem in computer vision that has been powered by well-known
algorithms such as the familiar 5-point or 8-point algorithm. However, despite
their acclaim, these algorithms are limited to processing point correspondences
originating from a pair of views each one representing an instantaneous capture
of the scene. Yet, in the case of rolling shutter cameras, or more recently,
event cameras, this synchronization breaks down. In this work, we present a
unified approach for structure and linear motion estimation from 2D point
correspondences with arbitrary timestamps, from an arbitrary set of views. By
formulating the problem in terms of first-order dynamics and leveraging a
constant velocity motion model, we derive a novel, linear point incidence
relation allowing for the efficient recovery of both linear velocity and 3D
points with predictable degeneracies and solution multiplicities. Owing to its
general formulation, it can handle correspondences from a wide range of sensing
modalities such as global shutter, rolling shutter, and event cameras, and can
even combine correspondences from different collocated sensors. We validate the
effectiveness of our solver on both simulated and real-world data, where we
show consistent improvement across all modalities when compared to recent
approaches. We believe our work opens the door to efficient structure and
motion estimation from asynchronous data. Code can be found at

Abstract: Accurate human trajectory prediction is one of the most crucial tasks for
autonomous driving, ensuring its safety. Yet, existing models often fail to
fully leverage the visual cues that humans subconsciously communicate when
navigating the space. In this work, we study the benefits of predicting human
trajectories using human body poses instead of solely their Cartesian space
locations in time. We propose `Social-pose', an attention-based pose encoder
that effectively captures the poses of all humans in a scene and their social
relations. Our method can be integrated into various trajectory prediction
architectures. We have conducted extensive experiments on state-of-the-art
models (based on LSTM, GAN, MLP, and Transformer), and showed improvements over
all of them on synthetic (Joint Track Auto) and real (Human3.6M, Pedestrians
and Cyclists in Road Traffic, and JRDB) datasets. We also explored the
advantages of using 2D versus 3D poses, as well as the effect of noisy poses
and the application of our pose-based predictor in robot navigation scenarios.

exploring traditional handcrafted methods and emphasizing contemporary deep
learning approaches across various modalities, including RGB images, depth

intra-modality variations but struggle with significant modality gaps.
Contemporary deep learning-based methods, exemplified by detector-free
strategies like CNN-based SuperPoint and transformer-based LoFTR, substantially
improve robustness and adaptability across modalities. We highlight
modality-aware advancements, such as geometric and depth-specific descriptors
for depth images, sparse and dense learning methods for 3D point clouds,
attention-enhanced neural networks for LiDAR scans, and specialized solutions
like the MIND descriptor for complex medical image matching. Cross-modal
applications, particularly in medical image registration and vision-language

Abstract: Video Object Segmentation and Tracking (VOST) presents a complex yet critical
challenge in computer vision, requiring robust integration of segmentation and
tracking across temporally dynamic frames. Traditional methods have struggled
with domain generalization, temporal consistency, and computational efficiency.
The emergence of foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and
its successor, SAM2, has introduced a paradigm shift, enabling prompt-driven
segmentation with strong generalization capabilities. Building upon these
advances, this survey provides a comprehensive review of SAM/SAM2-based methods
for VOST, structured along three temporal dimensions: past, present, and
future. We examine strategies for retaining and updating historical information
(past), approaches for extracting and optimizing discriminative features from
the current frame (present), and motion prediction and trajectory estimation
mechanisms for anticipating object dynamics in subsequent frames (future). In
doing so, we highlight the evolution from early memory-based architectures to
the streaming memory and real-time segmentation capabilities of SAM2. We also
discuss recent innovations such as motion-aware memory selection and
trajectory-guided prompting, which aim to enhance both accuracy and efficiency.
Finally, we identify remaining challenges including memory redundancy, error
accumulation, and prompt inefficiency, and suggest promising directions for
future research. This survey offers a timely and structured overview of the
field, aiming to guide researchers and practitioners in advancing the state of
VOST through the lens of foundation models.

Conclusion: 参数高效微调胎儿超声基础模型可实现任务适配，推动资源有限地区的产前护理发展。

Abstract: Accurate fetal biometric measurements, such as abdominal circumference, play
a vital role in prenatal care. However, obtaining high-quality ultrasound
images for these measurements heavily depends on the expertise of sonographers,
posing a significant challenge in low-income countries due to the scarcity of
trained personnel. To address this issue, we leverage FetalCLIP, a
vision-language model pretrained on a curated dataset of over 210,000 fetal
ultrasound image-caption pairs, to perform automated fetal ultrasound image
quality assessment (IQA) on blind-sweep ultrasound data. We introduce
FetalCLIP$_{CLS}$, an IQA model adapted from FetalCLIP using Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA), and evaluate it on the ACOUSLIC-AI dataset against six CNN
and Transformer baselines. FetalCLIP$_{CLS}$ achieves the highest F1 score of
0.757. Moreover, we show that an adapted segmentation model, when repurposed
for classification, further improves performance, achieving an F1 score of
0.771. Our work demonstrates how parameter-efficient fine-tuning of fetal
ultrasound foundation models can enable task-specific adaptations, advancing

*Yuqi Pang,Bowen Yang,Yun Cao,Fan Rong,Xiaoyu Li,Chen He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoCHA是一种新型视觉框架，通过整合多种视觉骨干网络和稀疏专家模块，动态提取互补视觉特征，并采用分层组注意力和自适应门控策略优化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉大语言模型（VLLMs）在训练和推理成本高、跨模态信息提取不足方面存在问题。

Method: MoCHA整合CLIP、SigLIP、DINOv2和ConvNeXt四种视觉骨干网络，结合稀疏专家模块（MoECs）和分层组注意力（HGA）动态优化视觉特征。

Result: MoCHA在Phi2-2.7B和Vicuna-7B上表现优异，优于现有开源模型，如幻觉减少3.25%（POPE）和视觉指令跟随能力提升153点（MME）。

Conclusion: MoCHA通过MoECs和HGA模块显著提升了性能，验证了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision large language models (VLLMs) are focusing primarily on handling
complex and fine-grained visual information by incorporating advanced vision
encoders and scaling up visual models. However, these approaches face high
training and inference costs, as well as challenges in extracting visual
details, effectively bridging across modalities. In this work, we propose a
novel visual framework, MoCHA, to address these issues. Our framework
integrates four vision backbones (i.e., CLIP, SigLIP, DINOv2 and ConvNeXt) to
extract complementary visual features and is equipped with a sparse Mixture of
Experts Connectors (MoECs) module to dynamically select experts tailored to
different visual dimensions. To mitigate redundant or insufficient use of the
visual information encoded by the MoECs module, we further design a
Hierarchical Group Attention (HGA) with intra- and inter-group operations and
an adaptive gating strategy for encoded visual features. We train MoCHA on two
mainstream LLMs (e.g., Phi2-2.7B and Vicuna-7B) and evaluate their performance
across various benchmarks. Notably, MoCHA outperforms state-of-the-art
open-weight models on various tasks. For example, compared to CuMo
(Mistral-7B), our MoCHA (Phi2-2.7B) presents outstanding abilities to mitigate
hallucination by showing improvements of 3.25% in POPE and to follow visual
instructions by raising 153 points on MME. Finally, ablation studies further
confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed MoECs and HGA in
improving the overall performance of MoCHA.

TL;DR: 提出了一种数据无关、零样本的触发器反演方法DISTIL，通过扩散生成器和目标分类器引导，有效重构触发器，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络易受特洛伊（后门）攻击，现有触发器反演方法缺乏对触发器真实性的保证。

Method: 采用扩散生成器，在目标分类器引导下迭代生成候选触发器，限制搜索空间且避免对触发器外观的强假设。

Result: DISTIL在BackdoorBench数据集上准确率提升7.1%，在特洛伊目标检测模型扫描中提升9.4%。

Conclusion: DISTIL为无需大量数据或强先验假设的后门防御提供了新方向。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success across numerous
tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to Trojan (backdoor) attacks, raising serious
concerns about their safety in real-world mission-critical applications. A
common countermeasure is trigger inversion -- reconstructing malicious
"shortcut" patterns (triggers) inserted by an adversary during training.
Current trigger-inversion methods typically search the full pixel space under
specific assumptions but offer no assurances that the estimated trigger is more
than an adversarial perturbation that flips the model output. Here, we propose
a data-free, zero-shot trigger-inversion strategy that restricts the search
space while avoiding strong assumptions on trigger appearance. Specifically, we
incorporate a diffusion-based generator guided by the target classifier;
through iterative generation, we produce candidate triggers that align with the
internal representations the model relies on for malicious behavior. Empirical
evaluations, both quantitative and qualitative, show that our approach
reconstructs triggers that effectively distinguish clean versus Trojaned
models. DISTIL surpasses alternative methods by high margins, achieving up to
7.1% higher accuracy on the BackdoorBench dataset and a 9.4% improvement on
trojaned object detection model scanning, offering a promising new direction
for reliable backdoor defense without reliance on extensive data or strong
prior assumptions about triggers. The code is available at

<details>

Motivation: 传统的计算流体动力学（CFD）模拟计算成本高，而几何深度学习方法可以快速估计血流动力学参数，为临床实践提供高效工具。

Method: 采用E(3)-等变深度学习模型，结合新颖的几何描述符和投影几何代数，基于100名AAA患者的CT扫描数据进行训练。

Result: 模型在分布内和外部测试集上表现良好，能够适应几何重塑、边界条件变化和动脉树拓扑结构的变化，且对网格分辨率不敏感。

Conclusion: 该模型在血流动力学参数估计中具有高精度和强泛化能力，有望在临床实践中发挥作用。

Abstract: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are pathologic dilatations of the abdominal
aorta posing a high fatality risk upon rupture. Studying AAA progression and
rupture risk often involves in-silico blood flow modelling with computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) and extraction of hemodynamic factors like time-averaged
wall shear stress (TAWSS) or oscillatory shear index (OSI). However, CFD
simulations are known to be computationally demanding. Hence, in recent years,
geometric deep learning methods, operating directly on 3D shapes, have been
proposed as compelling surrogates, estimating hemodynamic parameters in just a
few seconds. In this work, we propose a geometric deep learning approach to
estimating hemodynamics in AAA patients, and study its generalisability to
common factors of real-world variation. We propose an E(3)-equivariant deep
learning model utilising novel robust geometrical descriptors and projective
geometric algebra. Our model is trained to estimate transient WSS using a
dataset of CT scans of 100 AAA patients, from which lumen geometries are
extracted and reference CFD simulations with varying boundary conditions are
obtained. Results show that the model generalizes well within the distribution,
as well as to the external test set. Moreover, the model can accurately
estimate hemodynamics across geometry remodelling and changes in boundary
conditions. Furthermore, we find that a trained model can be applied to
different artery tree topologies, where new and unseen branches are added
during inference. Finally, we find that the model is to a large extent agnostic
to mesh resolution. These results show the accuracy and generalisation of the
proposed model, and highlight its potential to contribute to hemodynamic
parameter estimation in clinical practice.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于双层优化的自监督方法，用于检测AI生成的人脸，显著优于现有方法，并能泛化到未见过的生成器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于监督学习的AI人脸检测器依赖特定生成器的合成图像，泛化能力有限。

Method: 采用双层优化：内层预训练视觉编码器，使用线性加权的预训练任务；外层优化任务权重以提升检测性能。

Result: 在单类和二分类任务中显著优于现有方法，泛化能力强。

Conclusion: 自监督方法能有效提升AI生成人脸的检测性能，泛化能力优异。

Abstract: AI-generated face detectors trained via supervised learning typically rely on
synthesized images from specific generators, limiting their generalization to
emerging generative techniques. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
self-supervised method based on bi-level optimization. In the inner loop, we
pretrain a vision encoder only on photographic face images using a set of
linearly weighted pretext tasks: classification of categorical exchangeable
image file format (EXIF) tags, ranking of ordinal EXIF tags, and detection of
artificial face manipulations. The outer loop then optimizes the relative
weights of these pretext tasks to enhance the coarse-grained detection of
manipulated faces, serving as a proxy task for identifying AI-generated faces.
In doing so, it aligns self-supervised learning more closely with the ultimate
goal of AI-generated face detection. Once pretrained, the encoder remains
fixed, and AI-generated faces are detected either as anomalies under a Gaussian
mixture model fitted to photographic face features or by a lightweight
two-layer perceptron serving as a binary classifier. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our detectors significantly outperform existing approaches in
both one-class and binary classification settings, exhibiting strong
generalization to unseen generators.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DepR是一个基于深度引导的单视图场景重建框架，通过实例级扩散和组合范式实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能充分利用深度信息的几何信息，仅将其用于推理阶段的物体布局估计。

Method: DepR在训练和推理阶段均利用深度信息，通过深度引导条件化编码形状先验，并在推理时优化DDIM采样和布局。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，DepR表现优异，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DepR展示了在单视图场景重建中的强大泛化能力。

Abstract: We propose DepR, a depth-guided single-view scene reconstruction framework
that integrates instance-level diffusion within a compositional paradigm.
Instead of reconstructing the entire scene holistically, DepR generates
individual objects and subsequently composes them into a coherent 3D layout.
Unlike previous methods that use depth solely for object layout estimation
during inference and therefore fail to fully exploit its rich geometric
information, DepR leverages depth throughout both training and inference.
Specifically, we introduce depth-guided conditioning to effectively encode
shape priors into diffusion models. During inference, depth further guides DDIM
sampling and layout optimization, enhancing alignment between the
reconstruction and the input image. Despite being trained on limited synthetic
data, DepR achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates strong
generalization in single-view scene reconstruction, as shown through
evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Motivation: 现有文本到代码生成方法难以捕捉UI的空间布局和视觉设计意图，而实际UI开发是多模态的，需从视觉草图或模型开始。

Method: 采用模块化多代理框架，分三阶段：基础（检测UI组件）、规划（构建分层布局）、生成（自适应提示合成HTML/CSS代码）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在布局准确性、结构连贯性和代码正确性上达到最优性能，并通过数据引擎增强模型表现。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了UI到代码生成的鲁棒性、可解释性和保真度，代码已开源。

Abstract: Automating the transformation of user interface (UI) designs into front-end
code holds significant promise for accelerating software development and
democratizing design workflows. While recent large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated progress in text-to-code generation, many existing approaches rely
solely on natural language prompts, limiting their effectiveness in capturing
spatial layout and visual design intent. In contrast, UI development in
practice is inherently multimodal, often starting from visual sketches or
mockups. To address this gap, we introduce a modular multi-agent framework that
performs UI-to-code generation in three interpretable stages: grounding,
planning, and generation. The grounding agent uses a vision-language model to
detect and label UI components, the planning agent constructs a hierarchical
layout using front-end engineering priors, and the generation agent produces
HTML/CSS code via adaptive prompt-based synthesis. This design improves
robustness, interpretability, and fidelity over end-to-end black-box methods.
Furthermore, we extend the framework into a scalable data engine that
automatically produces large-scale image-code pairs. Using these synthetic
examples, we fine-tune and reinforce an open-source VLM, yielding notable gains
in UI understanding and code quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in layout accuracy,
structural coherence, and code correctness. Our code is made publicly available

TL;DR: CapRecover是一种跨模态反演框架，直接从中间特征恢复高级语义内容（如标签或描述），无需图像重建，解决了视觉语言模型中的语义信息泄漏问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型在分体DNN配置中的部署增加，中间特征的语义信息泄漏风险上升，现有方法重建的图像模糊且语义模糊。

Method: 提出CapRecover框架，直接从中间特征恢复语义内容，并通过实验验证其在标签和描述恢复上的性能。

Result: CapRecover在CIFAR-10上达到92.71%的Top-1标签准确率，在COCO2017上生成流畅描述（ROUGE-L得分0.52）。

Conclusion: CapRecover有效解决语义泄漏问题，并提出一种简单保护方法（添加随机噪声）来防止泄漏。

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in split-DNN
configurations--with visual encoders (e.g., ResNet, ViT) operating on user
devices and sending intermediate features to the cloud--there is a growing
privacy risk from semantic information leakage. Existing approaches to
reconstructing images from these intermediate features often result in blurry,
semantically ambiguous images. To directly address semantic leakage, we propose
CapRecover, a cross-modality inversion framework that recovers high-level
semantic content, such as labels or captions, directly from intermediate
features without image reconstruction.
  We evaluate CapRecover on multiple datasets and victim models, demonstrating
strong performance in semantic recovery. Specifically, CapRecover achieves up
to 92.71% Top-1 label accuracy on CIFAR-10 and generates fluent captions from
ResNet50 features on COCO2017 with ROUGE-L scores up to 0.52. Our analysis
further reveals that deeper convolutional layers encode significantly more
semantic information compared to shallow layers. To mitigate semantic leakage,
we introduce a simple yet effective protection method: adding random noise to
intermediate features at each layer and removing the noise in the next layer.
Experimental results show that this approach prevents semantic leakage without
additional training costs.

Result: 在FGVC和VTAB-1k基准测试中，性能分别超过全微调3.40%和10.35%。

Conclusion: TR-PTS通过任务相关优化，显著提升效率和性能，适用于大规模预训练模型微调。

Abstract: Large pre-trained models achieve remarkable performance in vision tasks but
are impractical for fine-tuning due to high computational and storage costs.
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods mitigate this issue by updating
only a subset of parameters; however, most existing approaches are
task-agnostic, failing to fully exploit task-specific adaptations, which leads
to suboptimal efficiency and performance. To address this limitation, we
propose Task-Relevant Parameter and Token Selection (TR-PTS), a task-driven
framework that enhances both computational efficiency and accuracy.
Specifically, we introduce Task-Relevant Parameter Selection, which utilizes
the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) to identify and fine-tune only the most
informative parameters in a layer-wise manner, while keeping the remaining
parameters frozen. Simultaneously, Task-Relevant Token Selection dynamically
preserves the most informative tokens and merges redundant ones, reducing
computational overhead. By jointly optimizing parameters and tokens, TR-PTS
enables the model to concentrate on task-discriminative information. We
evaluate TR-PTS on benchmark, including FGVC and VTAB-1k, where it achieves
state-of-the-art performance, surpassing full fine-tuning by 3.40% and 10.35%,
respectively. The code are available at https://github.com/synbol/TR-PTS.

Conclusion: LCS展示了高效超分辨率模型在资源受限设备上的潜力。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of content rendering in modern games has led to a
problematic growth in the workload of the GPU. In this paper, we propose an
AI-based low-complexity scaler (LCS) inspired by state-of-the-art efficient
super-resolution (ESR) models which could offload the workload on the GPU to a
low-power device such as a neural processing unit (NPU). The LCS is trained on
GameIR image pairs natively rendered at low and high resolution. We utilize
adversarial training to encourage reconstruction of perceptually important
details, and apply reparameterization and quantization techniques to reduce
model complexity and size. In our comparative analysis we evaluate the LCS
alongside the publicly available AMD hardware-based Edge Adaptive Scaling
Function (EASF) and AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 1 (FSR1) on five different
metrics, and find that the LCS achieves better perceptual quality,
demonstrating the potential of ESR models for upscaling on resource-constrained
devices.

Abstract: Referring audio-visual segmentation (RAVS) has recently seen significant
advancements, yet challenges remain in integrating multimodal information and
deeply understanding and reasoning about audiovisual content. To extend the
boundaries of RAVS and facilitate future research in this field, we propose
Omnimodal Referring Audio-Visual Segmentation (OmniAVS), a new dataset
containing 2,098 videos and 59,458 multimodal referring expressions. OmniAVS
stands out with three key innovations: (1) 8 types of multimodal expressions
that flexibly combine text, speech, sound, and visual cues; (2) an emphasis on
understanding audio content beyond just detecting their presence; and (3) the
inclusion of complex reasoning and world knowledge in expressions. Furthermore,
we introduce Omnimodal Instructed Segmentation Assistant (OISA), to address the
challenges of multimodal reasoning and fine-grained understanding of
audiovisual content in OmniAVS. OISA uses MLLM to comprehend complex cues and
perform reasoning-based segmentation. Extensive experiments show that OISA
outperforms existing methods on OmniAVS and achieves competitive results on

Abstract: As autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) proliferate in
high-stakes domains -- from pharmaceuticals to legal workflows -- the challenge
is no longer just intelligence, but verifiability. We introduce TrustTrack, a
protocol that embeds structural guarantees -- verifiable identity, policy
commitments, and tamper-resistant behavioral logs -- directly into agent
infrastructure. This enables a new systems paradigm: trust-native autonomy. By
treating compliance as a design constraint rather than post-hoc oversight,
TrustTrack reframes how intelligent agents operate across organizations and
jurisdictions. We present the protocol design, system requirements, and use
cases in regulated domains such as pharmaceutical R&D, legal automation, and
AI-native collaboration. We argue that the Cloud -> AI -> Agent -> Trust
transition represents the next architectural layer for autonomous systems.

Result: 在回合制追逃游戏中，GGPI算法能生成高奖励交互和一次性策略迁移，且在更广泛的初始条件下表现优于基线算法。

Conclusion: GGPI算法在多智能体游戏中实现了高效的知识迁移和策略改进。

Abstract: This paper explores successor features for knowledge transfer in zero-sum,
complete-information, and turn-based games. Prior research in single-agent
systems has shown that successor features can provide a ``jump start" for
agents when facing new tasks with varying reward structures. However, knowledge
transfer in games typically relies on value and equilibrium transfers, which
heavily depends on the similarity between tasks. This reliance can lead to
failures when the tasks differ significantly. To address this issue, this paper
presents an application of successor features to games and presents a novel
algorithm called Game Generalized Policy Improvement (GGPI), designed to
address Markov games in multi-agent reinforcement learning. The proposed
algorithm enables the transfer of learning values and policies across games. An
upper bound of the errors for transfer is derived as a function the similarity
of the task. Through experiments with a turn-based pursuer-evader game, we
demonstrate that the GGPI algorithm can generate high-reward interactions and
one-shot policy transfer. When further tested in a wider set of initial
conditions, the GGPI algorithm achieves higher success rates with improved path
efficiency compared to those of the baseline algorithms.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving domain of autonomous systems, interaction among
agents within a shared environment is both inevitable and essential for
enhancing overall system capabilities. A key requirement in such multi-agent
systems is the ability of each agent to reliably predict the future positions
of its nearest neighbors. Traditionally, graphs and graph theory have served as
effective tools for modeling inter agent communication and relationships. While
this approach is widely used, the present work proposes a novel method that
leverages dynamic graphs in a forward looking manner. Specifically, the
employment of EvolveGCN, a dynamic graph convolutional network, to forecast the
evolution of inter-agent relationships over time. To improve prediction
accuracy and ensure physical plausibility, this research incorporates physics
constrained loss functions based on the Clohessy-Wiltshire equations of motion.
This integrated approach enhances the reliability of future state estimations

Method: 采用量子启发的四阶段方法：权重初始化、标签变换、量子损失函数和权重混合。

Result: 在多种数据集和架构上验证，QPAudioEraser实现了目标数据的完全擦除（0%遗忘准确率），且对模型性能影响极小（仅0.05%）。

Conclusion: QPAudioEraser是一种高效的隐私保护解决方案，优于传统方法。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of voice-enabled authentication and audio biometric
systems have significantly increased privacy vulnerabilities associated with
sensitive speech data. Compliance with privacy regulations such as GDPR's right
to be forgotten and India's DPDP Act necessitates targeted and efficient
erasure of individual-specific voice signatures from already-trained biometric
models. Existing unlearning methods designed for visual data inadequately
handle the sequential, temporal, and high-dimensional nature of audio signals,
leading to ineffective or incomplete speaker and accent erasure. To address
this, we introduce QPAudioEraser, a quantum-inspired audio unlearning
framework. Our our-phase approach involves: (1) weight initialization using
destructive interference to nullify target features, (2) superposition-based
label transformations that obscure class identity, (3) an
uncertainty-maximizing quantum loss function, and (4) entanglement-inspired
mixing of correlated weights to retain model knowledge. Comprehensive
evaluations with ResNet18, ViT, and CNN architectures across AudioMNIST, Speech
Commands, LibriSpeech, and Speech Accent Archive datasets validate
QPAudioEraser's superior performance. The framework achieves complete erasure
of target data (0% Forget Accuracy) while incurring minimal impact on model
utility, with a performance degradation on retained data as low as 0.05%.
QPAudioEraser consistently surpasses conventional baselines across
single-class, multi-class, sequential, and accent-level erasure scenarios,
establishing the proposed approach as a robust privacy-preserving solution.

TL;DR: 提出了一种两步学习框架，通过轨迹重排序和任务特定特征学习，解决了单分支和双分支SELD方法的局限性，提升了事件分类和定位性能。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SELD方法中，单分支模型共享SED和DoA表示导致优化冲突，双分支模型分离任务但限制了信息交换，需要一种新方法来解决这些问题。

Method: 1. 引入轨迹重排序格式保持时间一致性；2. 分别训练SED和DoA网络以避免干扰；3. 有效融合DoA和SED特征。

Result: 在2023 DCASE挑战赛Task 3数据集上验证，框架克服了单分支和双分支的局限性，提升了事件分类和定位性能。

Conclusion: 提出的两步学习框架有效解决了SELD任务中的优化冲突和信息交换问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Sound Event Localization and Detection (SELD) is crucial in spatial audio
processing, enabling systems to detect sound events and estimate their 3D
directions. Existing SELD methods use single- or dual-branch architectures:
single-branch models share SED and DoA representations, causing optimization
conflicts, while dual-branch models separate tasks but limit information
exchange. To address this, we propose a two-step learning framework. First, we
introduce a tracwise reordering format to maintain temporal consistency,
preventing event reassignments across tracks. Next, we train SED and DoA
networks to prevent interference and ensure task-specific feature learning.
Finally, we effectively fuse DoA and SED features to enhance SELD performance
with better spatial and event representation. Experiments on the 2023 DCASE
challenge Task 3 dataset validate our framework, showing its ability to
overcome single- and dual-branch limitations and improve event classification
and localization.

<details>

Motivation: 自回归TTS模型的注意力机制对齐脆弱，难以泛化到长文本和域外文本；非自回归TTS模型依赖外部时长数据。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的时长预测框架，能够根据给定文本生成音素级时长分布。

Result: 实验表明，该模型在对齐准确性上提升了约11.3%，并增强了零样本TTS模型对提示音频与输入音频不匹配的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的时长预测框架显著优于基线模型，为TTS对齐问题提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Speech-to-text alignment is a critical component of neural text to-speech
(TTS) models. Autoregressive TTS models typically use an attention mechanism to
learn these alignments on-line. However, these alignments tend to be brittle
and often fail to generalize to long utterances and out-of-domain text, leading
to missing or repeating words. Most non-autoregressive end to-end TTS models
rely on durations extracted from external sources, using additional duration
models for alignment. In this paper, we propose a novel duration prediction
framework that can give compromising phoneme-level duration distribution with
given text. In our experiments, the proposed duration model has more precise
prediction and condition adaptation ability compared to previous baseline
models. Numerically, it has roughly a 11.3 percents immprovement on alignment
accuracy, and makes the performance of zero-shot TTS models more robust to the
mismatch between prompt audio and input audio.

Conclusion: Dragon-FM在播客数据集上展示了零样本生成能力，适用于长内容生成。

Abstract: While diffusion and autoregressive (AR) models have significantly advanced
generative modeling, they each present distinct limitations. AR models, which
rely on causal attention, cannot exploit future context and suffer from slow
generation speeds. Conversely, diffusion models struggle with key-value (KV)
caching. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Dragon-FM, a novel
text-to-speech (TTS) design that unifies AR and flow-matching. This model
processes 48 kHz audio codec tokens in chunks at a compact 12.5 tokens per
second rate. This design enables AR modeling across chunks, ensuring global
coherence, while parallel flow-matching within chunks facilitates fast
iterative denoising. Consequently, the proposed model can utilize KV-cache
across chunks and incorporate future context within each chunk. Furthermore, it
bridges continuous and discrete feature modeling, demonstrating that continuous
AR flow-matching can predict discrete tokens with finite scalar quantizers.
This efficient codec and fast chunk-autoregressive architecture also makes the
proposed model particularly effective for generating extended content.
Experiment for demos of our work} on podcast datasets demonstrate its
capability to efficiently generate high-quality zero-shot podcasts.

Method: 基于现有模型，量化载荷对机器人生长和自支撑的影响，并开发预测载荷滑动的模型，通过实验验证不同形状、大小和重量的载荷运输能力。

Result: 成功运输多种形状、重达1.5kg的载荷，并能通过极小间隙（0.01cm）、完成135度转向和跨越1.15m无支撑间隙。

Abstract: Soft everting robots present significant advantages over traditional rigid
robots, including enhanced dexterity, improved environmental interaction, and
safe navigation in unpredictable environments. While soft everting robots have
been widely demonstrated for exploration type tasks, their potential to move
and deploy payloads in such tasks has been less investigated, with previous
work focusing on sensors and tools for the robot. Leveraging the navigation
capabilities, and deployed body, of the soft everting robot to deliver payloads
in hazardous areas, e.g. carrying a water bottle to a person stuck under
debris, would represent a significant capability in many applications. In this
work, we present an analysis of how soft everting robots can be used to deploy
larger, heavier payloads through the inside of the robot. We analyze both what
objects can be deployed and what terrain features they can be carried through.
Building on existing models, we present methods to quantify the effects of
payloads on robot growth and self-support, and develop a model to predict
payload slip. We then experimentally quantify payload transport using soft
everting robot with a variety of payload shapes, sizes, and weights and though
a series of tasks: steering, vertical transport, movement through holes, and
movement across gaps. Overall, the results show that we can transport payloads
in a variety of shapes and up to 1.5kg in weight and that we can move through
circular apertures with as little as 0.01cm clearance around payloads, carry
out discrete turns up to 135 degrees, and move across unsupported gaps of 1.15m
in length.

Abstract: Wheel-legged robots integrate the agility of legs for navigating rough
terrains while harnessing the efficiency of wheels for smooth surfaces.
However, most existing designs do not fully capitalize on the benefits of both
legged and wheeled structures, which limits overall system flexibility and
efficiency. We present FLORES (reconfigured wheel-legged robot for enhanced
steering and adaptability), a novel wheel-legged robot design featuring a
distinctive front-leg configuration that sets it beyond standard design
approaches. Specifically, FLORES replaces the conventional hip-roll degree of
freedom (DoF) of the front leg with hip-yaw DoFs, and this allows for efficient
movement on flat surfaces while ensuring adaptability when navigating complex
terrains. This innovative design facilitates seamless transitions between
different locomotion modes (i.e., legged locomotion and wheeled locomotion) and
optimizes the performance across varied environments. To fully exploit FLORES's
mechanical capabilities, we develop a tailored reinforcement learning (RL)
controller that adapts the Hybrid Internal Model (HIM) with a customized reward
structure optimized for our unique mechanical configuration. This framework
enables the generation of adaptive, multi-modal locomotion strategies that
facilitate smooth transitions between wheeled and legged movements.
Furthermore, our distinctive joint design enables the robot to exhibit novel
and highly efficient locomotion gaits that capitalize on the synergistic
advantages of both locomotion modes. Through comprehensive experiments, we
demonstrate FLORES's enhanced steering capabilities, improved navigation
efficiency, and versatile locomotion across various terrains. The open-source

Conclusion: 该方法为自主动土作业提供了土壤感知能力，具有实际应用前景。

Abstract: Existing earthmoving autonomy is largely confined to highly controlled and
well-characterized environments due to the complexity of vehicle-terrain
interaction dynamics and the partial observability of the terrain resulting
from unknown and spatially varying soil conditions. In this chapter, a a
soil-property mapping system is proposed to extend the environmental state, in
order to overcome these restrictions and facilitate development of more robust
autonomous earthmoving. A GPU accelerated elevation mapping system is extended
to incorporate a blind mapping component which traces the movement of the blade
through the terrain to displace and erode intersected soil, enabling separately
tracking undisturbed and disturbed soil. Each interaction is approximated as a
flat blade moving through a locally homogeneous soil, enabling modeling of
cutting forces using the fundamental equation of earthmoving (FEE). Building
upon our prior work on in situ soil-property estimation, a method is devised to
extract approximate geometric parameters of the model given the uneven terrain,
and an improved physics infused neural network (PINN) model is developed to
predict soil properties and uncertainties of these estimates. A simulation of a
compact track loader (CTL) with a blade attachment is used to collect data to
train the PINN model. Post-training, the model is leveraged online by the
mapping system to track soil property estimates spatially as separate layers in
the map, with updates being performed in a Bayesian manner. Initial experiments
show that the system accurately highlights regions requiring higher relative
interaction forces, indicating the promise of this approach in enabling
soil-aware planning for autonomous terrain shaping.

Conclusion: 提出的因果结构学习框架简单有效，能够提升模仿学习在机器人操作任务中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent developments in imitation learning have considerably advanced robotic
manipulation. However, current techniques in imitation learning can suffer from
poor generalization, limiting performance even under relatively minor domain
shifts. In this work, we aim to enhance the generalization capabilities of
complex imitation learning algorithms to handle unpredictable changes from the
training environments to deployment environments. To avoid confusion caused by
observations that are not relevant to the target task, we propose to explicitly
learn the causal relationship between observation components and expert
actions, employing a framework similar to [6], where a causal structural
function is learned by intervention on the imitation learning policy.
Disentangling the feature representation from image input as in [6] is hard to
satisfy in complex imitation learning process in robotic manipulation, we
theoretically clarify that this requirement is not necessary in causal
relationship learning. Therefore, we propose a simple causal structure learning
framework that can be easily embedded in recent imitation learning
architectures, such as the Action Chunking Transformer [31]. We demonstrate our
approach using a simulation of the ALOHA [31] bimanual robot arms in Mujoco,
and show that the method can considerably mitigate the generalization problem
of existing complex imitation learning algorithms.

Motivation: 端到端自动驾驶系统缺乏可解释性，需确保运动计划的安全性，因此需要一种既能检测所有不安全计划（完整性）又不误判安全计划（稳健性）的安全监控器。

Method: 利用多模态轨迹预测器近似周围智能体的前向可达集（FRS），通过凸优化提取数据驱动的FRS，并结合保形预测校准FRS以确保完整性。在分布外场景或预测器失效时，引入贝叶斯滤波器动态调整FRS的保守性。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提高了稳健性，同时保持了完整性。

Conclusion: 该方法为学习型自动驾驶系统提供了一种实用且可靠的安全监控器。

Abstract: The advent of end-to-end autonomy stacks - often lacking interpretable
intermediate modules - has placed an increased burden on ensuring that the
final output, i.e., the motion plan, is safe in order to validate the safety of
the entire stack. This requires a safety monitor that is both complete (able to
detect all unsafe plans) and sound (does not flag safe plans). In this work, we
propose a principled safety monitor that leverages modern multi-modal
trajectory predictors to approximate forward reachable sets (FRS) of
surrounding agents. By formulating a convex program, we efficiently extract
these data-driven FRSs directly from the predicted state distributions,
conditioned on scene context such as lane topology and agent history. To ensure
completeness, we leverage conformal prediction to calibrate the FRS and
guarantee coverage of ground-truth trajectories with high probability. To
preserve soundness in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios or under predictor
failure, we introduce a Bayesian filter that dynamically adjusts the FRS
conservativeness based on the predictor's observed performance. We then assess
the safety of the ego vehicle's motion plan by checking for intersections with
these calibrated FRSs, ensuring the plan remains collision-free under plausible
future behaviors of others. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset show
our approach significantly improves soundness while maintaining completeness,
offering a practical and reliable safety monitor for learned autonomy stacks.

Motivation: 开发安全验证方法对自动驾驶系统的安全部署至关重要，而场景参数PDF的准确估计是关键。传统方法因假设或简化模型存在局限性，NF提供了一种无需严格假设的高维密度估计方案。

Result: NF在风险评估和不确定性量化上优于KDE，对维度灾难更不敏感，但计算资源需求更高。

Conclusion: NF在场景化安全评估中具有潜力，未来研究将优化NF架构和训练以提升其适用性。

Abstract: The development of safety validation methods is essential for the safe
deployment and operation of Automated Driving Systems (ADSs). One of the goals
of safety validation is to prospectively evaluate the risk of an ADS dealing
with real-world traffic. Scenario-based assessment is a widely-used approach,
where test cases are derived from real-world driving data. To allow for a
quantitative analysis of the system performance, the exposure of the scenarios
must be accurately estimated. The exposure of scenarios at parameter level is
expressed using a Probability Density Function (PDF). However, assumptions
about the PDF, such as parameter independence, can introduce errors, while
avoiding assumptions often leads to oversimplified models with limited
parameters to mitigate the curse of dimensionality.
  This paper considers the use of Normalizing Flows (NF) for estimating the PDF
of the parameters. NF are a class of generative models that transform a simple
base distribution into a complex one using a sequence of invertible and
differentiable mappings, enabling flexible, high-dimensional density estimation
without restrictive assumptions on the PDF's shape. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of NF in quantifying risk and risk uncertainty of an ADS,
comparing its performance with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), a traditional
method for non-parametric PDF estimation. While NF require more computational
resources compared to KDE, NF is less sensitive to the curse of dimensionality.
As a result, NF can improve risk uncertainty estimation, offering a more
precise assessment of an ADS's safety.
  This work illustrates the potential of NF in scenario-based safety. Future
work involves experimenting more with using NF for scenario generation and
optimizing the NF architecture, transformation types, and training
hyperparameters to further enhance their applicability.

developed in the Horizon Europe projects that focus on safety assessment

Abstract: Land-air bimodal robots (LABR) are gaining attention for autonomous
navigation, combining high mobility from aerial vehicles with long endurance
from ground vehicles. However, existing LABR navigation methods are limited by
suboptimal trajectories from mapping-based approaches and the excessive
computational demands of learning-based methods. To address this, we propose a
two-stage lightweight framework that integrates global key points prediction
with local trajectory refinement to generate efficient and reachable
trajectories. In the first stage, the Global Key points Prediction Network
(GKPN) was used to generate a hybrid land-air keypoint path. The GKPN includes
a Sobel Perception Network (SPN) for improved obstacle detection and a
Lightweight Attention Planning Network (LAPN) to improves predictive ability by
capturing contextual information. In the second stage, the global path is
segmented based on predicted key points and refined using a mapping-based
planner to create smooth, collision-free trajectories. Experiments conducted on
our LABR platform show that our framework reduces network parameters by 14\%
and energy consumption during land-air transitions by 35\% compared to existing
approaches. The framework achieves real-time navigation without GPU

single image frames, providing interpretable spatial localisation of anomalies,
whilst the SPRT introduces temporal evidence aggregation, enhancing robustness
against noise over sequences of image frames. Experimental results demonstrate
improved anomaly detection performance, highlighting the benefits of the

Abstract: Developing controllers that generalize across diverse robot morphologies
remains a significant challenge in legged locomotion. Traditional approaches
either create specialized controllers for each morphology or compromise
performance for generality. This paper introduces a two-stage teacher-student
framework that bridges this gap through policy distillation. First, we train
specialized teacher policies optimized for individual morphologies, capturing
the unique optimal control strategies for each robot design. Then, we distill
this specialized expertise into a single Transformer-based student policy
capable of controlling robots with varying leg configurations. Our experiments
across five distinct legged morphologies demonstrate that our approach
preserves morphology-specific optimal behaviors, with the Transformer
architecture achieving 94.47\% of teacher performance on training morphologies
and 72.64\% on unseen robot designs. Comparative analysis reveals that
Transformer-based architectures consistently outperform MLP baselines by
leveraging attention mechanisms to effectively model joint relationships across
different kinematic structures. We validate our approach through successful
deployment on a physical quadruped robot, demonstrating the practical viability
of our morphology-agnostic control framework. This work presents a scalable
solution for developing universal legged robot controllers that maintain
near-optimal performance while generalizing across diverse morphologies.

Abstract: Rigorous Verification and Validation (V&V) of Autonomous Driving Functions
(ADFs) is paramount for ensuring the safety and public acceptance of Autonomous

a framework based on Bayesian Optimization (BO) to accelerate the discovery of
critical scenarios. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework on an
Model Predictive Controller (MPC)-based motion planner, showing that it
identifies hazardous situations, such as off-road events, using orders of
magnitude fewer simulations than brute-force Design of Experiments (DoE)
methods. Furthermore, this study investigates the scalability of the framework
in higher-dimensional parameter spaces and its ability to identify multiple,
distinct critical regions within the ODD of the motion planner used as the case

TL;DR: CIMR是一种新型多模态推理框架，通过上下文感知的迭代推理和自我修正模块，显著提升了复杂多模态指令的处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言和视觉语言模型在复杂多模态指令处理中存在逻辑推理和动态反馈整合的不足。

Method: CIMR采用两阶段方法：初始推理与响应生成，随后通过多模态反馈进行迭代优化，并动态融合文本、视觉和上下文特征。

Result: 在Multi-modal Action Planning数据集上，CIMR以91.5%的准确率超越GPT-4V等现有模型。

Conclusion: CIMR的迭代推理和自我修正能力在复杂任务中表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has enhanced our ability to process and generate
human language and visual information. However, these models often struggle
with complex, multi-step multi-modal instructions that require logical
reasoning, dynamic feedback integration, and iterative self-correction. To
address this, we propose CIMR: Contextualized Iterative Multimodal Reasoning, a
novel framework that introduces a context-aware iterative reasoning and
self-correction module. CIMR operates in two stages: initial reasoning and
response generation, followed by iterative refinement using parsed multi-modal
feedback. A dynamic fusion module deeply integrates textual, visual, and
contextual features at each step. We fine-tune LLaVA-1.5-7B on the Visual
Instruction Tuning (VIT) dataset and evaluate CIMR on the newly introduced
Multi-modal Action Planning (MAP) dataset. CIMR achieves 91.5% accuracy,
outperforming state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4V (89.2%), LLaVA-1.5
(78.5%), MiniGPT-4 (75.3%), and InstructBLIP (72.8%), demonstrating the
efficacy of its iterative reasoning and self-correction capabilities in complex
tasks.

*Sergii Kavun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了两种新型混合激活函数S3和S4，解决了传统激活函数的问题，并通过实验验证了S4在性能和收敛速度上的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统激活函数如ReLU存在死神经元问题，sigmoid和tanh存在梯度消失问题，需要改进。

Method: 提出S3（Sigmoid-Softsign混合）和改进版S4（平滑过渡机制），并在多种任务和网络架构中进行实验。

Result: S4在MNIST、Iris分类和Boston Housing回归任务中表现优异，收敛速度更快，梯度更稳定。

Conclusion: 混合激活函数是改进神经网络训练动态的有前景方向，S4因其可调参数和性能成为深度学习应用的优选。

Abstract: Activation functions are critical components in deep neural networks,
directly influencing gradient flow, training stability, and model performance.
Traditional functions like ReLU suffer from dead neuron problems, while sigmoid
and tanh exhibit vanishing gradient issues. We introduce two novel hybrid
activation functions: S3 (Sigmoid-Softsign) and its improved version S4
(smoothed S3). S3 combines sigmoid for negative inputs with softsign for
positive inputs, while S4 employs a smooth transition mechanism controlled by a
steepness parameter k. We conducted comprehensive experiments across binary
classification, multi-class classification, and regression tasks using three
different neural network architectures. S4 demonstrated superior performance
compared to nine baseline activation functions, achieving 97.4% accuracy on
MNIST, 96.0% on Iris classification, and 18.7 MSE on Boston Housing regression.
The function exhibited faster convergence (-19 for ReLU) and maintained stable
gradient flow across network depths. Comparative analysis revealed S4's
gradient range of [0.24, 0.59] compared to ReLU's 18% dead neurons in deep
networks. The S4 activation function addresses key limitations of existing
functions through its hybrid design and smooth transition mechanism. The
tunable parameter k allows adaptation to different tasks and network depths,
making S4 a versatile choice for deep learning applications. These findings
suggest that hybrid activation functions represent a promising direction for
improving neural network training dynamics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应伪标签框架，通过原型一致性和邻域一致性提升CLIP的无监督适应性能，包含PICS和NALR两个组件，实验证明其在11个基准数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无监督适应中，CLIP的零样本预测伪标签噪声大，传统固定阈值方法不可靠，需更鲁棒的方法。

Method: 提出PICS评估伪标签准确性，NALR利用邻域语义相似性动态优化伪标签，并引入自适应权重机制。

Result: 在11个基准数据集上实现最先进性能，提供更准确的伪标签且计算高效。

Conclusion: 自适应伪标签框架显著提升CLIP的无监督适应能力，尤其在噪声和复杂场景下表现优异。

Abstract: In unsupervised adaptation for vision-language models such as CLIP,
pseudo-labels derived from zero-shot predictions often exhibit significant
noise, particularly under domain shifts or in visually complex scenarios.
Conventional pseudo-label filtering approaches, which rely on fixed confidence
thresholds, tend to be unreliable in fully unsupervised settings. In this work,
we propose a novel adaptive pseudo-labeling framework that enhances CLIP's
adaptation performance by integrating prototype consistency and
neighborhood-based consistency. The proposed method comprises two key
components: PICS, which assesses pseudo-label accuracy based on in-class
feature compactness and cross-class feature separation; and NALR, which
exploits semantic similarities among neighboring samples to refine
pseudo-labels dynamically. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive weighting
mechanism that adjusts the influence of pseudo-labeled samples during training
according to their estimated correctness. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in
unsupervised adaptation scenarios, delivering more accurate pseudo-labels while
maintaining computational efficiency.

TL;DR: ReLU网络学习了一种隐式线性模型，通过简单的反向传播修改可以提取其决策边界，揭示了高分辨率且感知对齐的特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索神经网络是否依赖可解释的学习模式，并验证其可恢复性。

Method: 通过修改反向传播过程，提取隐式线性模型的决策边界（称为激励回拉）。

Result: 激励回拉揭示了高分辨率、目标特定的特征，表明神经网络确实依赖可解释的模式。

Conclusion: 研究结果对知识发现和可靠人工智能系统的开发具有重要意义。

Abstract: In this paper we argue that ReLU networks learn an implicit linear model we
can actually tap into. We describe that alleged model formally and show that we
can approximately pull its decision boundary back to the input space with
certain simple modification to the backward pass. The resulting gradients
(called excitation pullbacks) reveal high-resolution input- and target-specific
features of remarkable perceptual alignment on a number of popular
ImageNet-pretrained deep architectures. This strongly suggests that neural
networks do, in fact, rely on learned interpretable patterns that can be
recovered after training. Thus, our findings may have profound implications for
knowledge discovery and the development of dependable artificial systems.

TL;DR: TIR框架通过闭环测试时提示优化，无需额外训练，提升文本到图像生成的一致性和准确性。

Motivation: 解决文本到图像生成模型对提示词微小变化的敏感性，导致输出不一致或不准确的问题。

Method: 采用闭环框架，结合预训练多模态大语言模型（MLLM）分析图像和提示词，迭代优化提示词。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上提升了生成图像与提示词的对齐性和视觉连贯性。

Conclusion: TIR框架通过迭代优化提示词，显著提升了文本到图像生成的质量，且兼容黑盒模型。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation models have made significant strides but still
struggle with prompt sensitivity: even minor changes in prompt wording can
yield inconsistent or inaccurate outputs. To address this challenge, we
introduce a closed-loop, test-time prompt refinement framework that requires no
additional training of the underlying T2I model, termed TIR. In our approach,
each generation step is followed by a refinement step, where a pretrained
multimodal large language model (MLLM) analyzes the output image and the user's
prompt. The MLLM detects misalignments (e.g., missing objects, incorrect
attributes) and produces a refined and physically grounded prompt for the next
round of image generation. By iteratively refining the prompt and verifying
alignment between the prompt and the image, TIR corrects errors, mirroring the
iterative refinement process of human artists. We demonstrate that this
closed-loop strategy improves alignment and visual coherence across multiple
benchmark datasets, all while maintaining plug-and-play integration with
black-box T2I models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着有限元模拟精度提高但计算成本增加，数据驱动设计需求增长，需要高效优化方法。BO和MFBO在真实工程问题（如超材料设计）中尚未直接比较。

Method: 采用Sobol'样本和基于方差的敏感性分析简化设计问题，并比较BO和MFBO在优化自旋体结构EA问题中的表现。

Result: MFBO在优化自旋体结构EA问题时表现优于BO，最高提升11%。

Conclusion: MFBO在昂贵的数据驱动设计问题中具有实用价值，结果开源以支持多保真度技术的应用。

Abstract: Finite element (FE) simulations of structures and materials are getting
increasingly more accurate, but also more computationally expensive as a
collateral result. This development happens in parallel with a growing demand
of data-driven design. To reconcile the two, a robust and data-efficient
optimization method called Bayesian optimization (BO) has been previously
established as a technique to optimize expensive objective functions. In
parallel, the mesh width of an FE model can be exploited to evaluate an
objective at a lower or higher fidelity (cost & accuracy) level. The
multi-fidelity setting applied to BO, called multi-fidelity BO (MFBO), has also
seen previous success. However, BO and MFBO have not seen a direct comparison
with when faced with with a real-life engineering problem, such as metamaterial
design for deformation and absorption qualities. Moreover, sampling quality and
assessing design parameter sensitivity is often an underrepresented part of
data-driven design. This paper aims to address these shortcomings by employing
Sobol' samples with variance-based sensitivity analysis in order to reduce
design problem complexity. Furthermore, this work describes, implements,
applies and compares the performance BO with that MFBO when maximizing the
energy absorption (EA) problem of spinodoid cellular structures is concerned.
The findings show that MFBO is an effective way to maximize the EA of a
spinodoid structure and is able to outperform BO by up to 11% across various
hyperparameter settings. The results, which are made open-source, serve to
support the utility of multi-fidelity techniques across expensive data-driven
design problems.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable prediction of estimated glomerular filtration rate
(eGFR) is essential for managing chronic kidney disease (CKD) and supporting
clinical decisions. Recent advances in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have
shown strong potential in clinical prediction tasks due to their ability to
process visual and textual information. However, challenges related to
deployment cost, data privacy, and model reliability hinder their adoption. In
this study, we propose a collaborative framework that enhances the performance
of open-source LMMs for eGFR forecasting while generating clinically meaningful
explanations. The framework incorporates visual knowledge transfer, abductive
reasoning, and a short-term memory mechanism to enhance prediction accuracy and
interpretability. Experimental results show that the proposed framework
achieves predictive performance and interpretability comparable to proprietary
models. It also provides plausible clinical reasoning processes behind each
prediction. Our method sheds new light on building AI systems for healthcare
that combine predictive accuracy with clinically grounded interpretability.

Motivation: 传统RL基于MDP的马尔可夫假设在实际通信网络中不成立，且无法有效捕捉复杂网络拓扑的空间关系，导致路由决策不优。

Result: 该方法在路由决策上优于传统RL技术，对网络拓扑变化更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 时空RL方法能有效解决通信网络中的路由优化问题，尤其在非马尔可夫和复杂拓扑环境下表现更优。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a well-established approach for
optimizing packet routing in communication networks. Standard RL algorithms
typically are based on the Markov Decision Process (MDP), which assumes that
the current state of the environment provides all the necessary information for
system evolution and decision-making. However, this Markovian assumption is
invalid in many practical scenarios, making the MDP and RL frameworks
inadequate to produce the optimal solutions. Additionally, traditional RL
algorithms often employ function approximations (e.g., by neural networks) that
do not explicitly capture the spatial relationships inherent in environments
with complex network topologies. Communication networks are characterized by
dynamic traffic patterns and arbitrary numbers of nodes and links, which
further complicate the decision-making process. To address these challenges, we
propose a spatial-temporal RL approach that integrates Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to adequately capture the spatial
dynamics regarding network topology and temporal traffic patterns,
respectively, to enhance routing decisions. Our evaluation demonstrates that
the proposed method outperforms and is more robust to changes in the network
topology when compared with traditional RL techniques.

Result: 实验表明，SourceSplice能以较少探索有效识别高质量数据源子集。

Conclusion: SourceSplice在多种设置下表现出对决策选择的敏感性，能显著提升任务效用。

Abstract: Data quality plays a pivotal role in the predictive performance of machine
learning (ML) tasks - a challenge amplified by the deluge of data sources
available in modern organizations.Prior work in data discovery largely focus on
metadata matching, semantic similarity or identifying tables that should be
joined to answer a particular query, but do not consider source quality for
high performance of the downstream ML task.This paper addresses the problem of
determining the best subset of data sources that must be combined to construct
the underlying training dataset for a given ML task.We propose SourceGrasp and
SourceSplice, frameworks designed to efficiently select a suitable subset of
sources that maximizes the utility of the downstream ML model.Both the
algorithms rely on the core idea that sources (or their combinations)
contribute differently to the task utility, and must be judiciously
chosen.While SourceGrasp utilizes a metaheuristic based on a greediness
criterion and randomization, the SourceSplice framework presents a source
selection mechanism inspired from gene splicing - a core concept used in
protein synthesis.We empirically evaluate our algorithms on three real-world
datasets and synthetic datasets and show that, with significantly fewer subset
explorations, SourceSplice effectively identifies subsets of data sources
leading to high task utility.We also conduct studies reporting the sensitivity
of SourceSplice to the decision choices under several settings.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在分布外和迁移学习评估中表现良好，为时间序列研究提供了实用工具。

Abstract: The emergence of time-series foundation model research elevates the growing
need to measure the (dis)similarity of time-series datasets. A time-series
dataset similarity measure aids research in multiple ways, including model
selection, finetuning, and visualization. In this paper, we propose a
distribution-based method to measure time-series dataset similarity by
leveraging the Wasserstein distance. We consider a time-series dataset an
empirical instantiation of an underlying multivariate normal distribution
(MVN). The similarity between two time-series datasets is thus computed as the
Wasserstein distance between their corresponding MVNs. Comprehensive
experiments and visualization show the effectiveness of our approach.
Specifically, we show how the Wasserstein distance helps identify similar
time-series datasets and facilitates inference performance estimation of
foundation models in both out-of-distribution and transfer learning evaluation,
with high correlations between our proposed measure and the inference loss
(>0.60).

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个可解释且可扩展的CTG分析框架。

Abstract: Remote fetal monitoring technologies are becoming increasingly common. Yet,
most current systems offer limited interpretability, leaving expectant parents
with raw cardiotocography (CTG) data that is difficult to understand. In this
work, we present CTG-Insight, a multi-agent LLM system that provides structured
interpretations of fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine contraction (UC) signals.
Drawing from established medical guidelines, CTG-Insight decomposes each CTG
trace into five medically defined features: baseline, variability,
accelerations, decelerations, and sinusoidal pattern, each analyzed by a
dedicated agent. A final aggregation agent synthesizes the outputs to deliver a
holistic classification of fetal health, accompanied by a natural language
explanation. We evaluate CTG-Insight on the NeuroFetalNet Dataset and compare
it against deep learning models and the single-agent LLM baseline. Results show
that CTG-Insight achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (96.4%) and F1-score
(97.8%) while producing transparent and interpretable outputs. This work
contributes an interpretable and extensible CTG analysis framework.

Abstract: Accurate load forecasting is essential to the operation of modern electric

for long-term planning. This paper presents a comparative analysis of machine
learning models, Linear Regression, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Long Short-Term

Abstract: Historically, neuroscience has progressed by fragmenting into specialized
domains, each focusing on isolated modalities, tasks, or brain regions. While
fruitful, this approach hinders the development of a unified model of
cognition. Here, we introduce TRIBE, the first deep neural network trained to
predict brain responses to stimuli across multiple modalities, cortical areas
and individuals. By combining the pretrained representations of text, audio and
video foundational models and handling their time-evolving nature with a
transformer, our model can precisely model the spatial and temporal fMRI
responses to videos, achieving the first place in the Algonauts 2025 brain
encoding competition with a significant margin over competitors. Ablations show
that while unimodal models can reliably predict their corresponding cortical
networks (e.g. visual or auditory networks), they are systematically
outperformed by our multimodal model in high-level associative cortices.
Currently applied to perception and comprehension, our approach paves the way
towards building an integrative model of representations in the human brain.

Conclusion: 该方法支持数据驱动的决策，优化数据源选择和资源分配，适用于不同领域的模型微调。

Abstract: We introduce a framework for optimizing domain-specific dataset construction
in foundation model training. Specifically, we seek a cost-efficient way to
estimate the quality of data sources (e.g. synthetically generated or filtered
web data, etc.) in order to make optimal decisions about resource allocation
for data sourcing from these sources for the stage two pre-training phase, aka
annealing, with the goal of specializing a generalist pre-trained model to
specific domains. Our approach extends the usual point estimate approaches, aka
micro-annealing, to estimating scaling laws by performing multiple annealing
runs of varying compute spent on data curation and training. This addresses a
key limitation in prior work, where reliance on point estimates for data
scaling decisions can be misleading due to the lack of rank invariance across
compute scales -- a phenomenon we confirm in our experiments. By systematically
analyzing performance gains relative to acquisition costs, we find that scaling
curves can be estimated for different data sources. Such scaling laws can
inform cost effective resource allocation across different data acquisition
methods (e.g. synthetic data), data sources (e.g. user or web data) and
available compute resources. We validate our approach through experiments on a
pre-trained model with 7 billion parameters. We adapt it to: a domain
well-represented in the pre-training data -- the medical domain, and a domain
underrepresented in the pretraining corpora -- the math domain. We show that
one can efficiently estimate the scaling behaviors of a data source by running
multiple annealing runs, which can lead to different conclusions, had one used
point estimates using the usual micro-annealing technique instead. This enables
data-driven decision-making for selecting and optimizing data sources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统智能研究过于关注外部目标，导致智能体缺乏适应性。作者希望通过内部知识结构的控制与多样化，实现更通用的智能。

Method: 提出表示赋能，以内部表征为主要计算基础，衡量智能体对自身知识结构的控制能力。

Result: 表示赋能为设计适应性强的智能系统提供了新视角。

Conclusion: 通过关注内部表征，智能体可以更好地实现通用性和适应性。

Abstract: The pursuit of general intelligence has traditionally centered on external
objectives: an agent's control over its environments or mastery of specific
tasks. This external focus, however, can produce specialized agents that lack
adaptability. We propose representational empowerment, a new perspective
towards a truly agent-centric learning paradigm by moving the locus of control
inward. This objective measures an agent's ability to controllably maintain and
diversify its own knowledge structures. We posit that the capacity -- to shape
one's own understanding -- is an element for achieving better ``preparedness''
distinct from direct environmental influence. Focusing on internal
representations as the main substrate for computing empowerment offers a new
lens through which to design adaptable intelligent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准CFM生成的路径偏离直线插值，导致生成速度慢且精度低，而现有改进方法依赖计算成本高的最优传输。

Method: 提出加权条件流匹配（W-CFM），通过Gibbs核加权训练对，恢复熵最优传输耦合。

Result: W-CFM在合成和真实数据集上表现出与其他基线相当或更优的样本质量、保真度和多样性。

Conclusion: W-CFM克服了批量大小的计算瓶颈，同时保持了CFM的计算效率。

Abstract: Conditional flow matching (CFM) has emerged as a powerful framework for
training continuous normalizing flows due to its computational efficiency and
effectiveness. However, standard CFM often produces paths that deviate
significantly from straight-line interpolations between prior and target
distributions, making generation slower and less accurate due to the need for
fine discretization at inference. Recent methods enhance CFM performance by
inducing shorter and straighter trajectories but typically rely on
computationally expensive mini-batch optimal transport (OT). Drawing insights
from entropic optimal transport (EOT), we propose Weighted Conditional Flow
Matching (W-CFM), a novel approach that modifies the classical CFM loss by
weighting each training pair $(x, y)$ with a Gibbs kernel. We show that this
weighting recovers the entropic OT coupling up to some bias in the marginals,
and we provide the conditions under which the marginals remain nearly
unchanged. Moreover, we establish an equivalence between W-CFM and the
minibatch OT method in the large-batch limit, showing how our method overcomes
computational and performance bottlenecks linked to batch size. Empirically, we
test our method on unconditional generation on various synthetic and real
datasets, confirming that W-CFM achieves comparable or superior sample quality,
fidelity, and diversity to other alternative baselines while maintaining the
computational efficiency of vanilla CFM.

Abstract: Sensor-based sorting systems enable the physical separation of a material
stream into two fractions. The sorting decision is based on the image data
evaluation of the sensors used and is carried out using actuators. Various
process parameters must be set depending on the properties of the material
stream, the dimensioning of the system, and the required sorting accuracy.
However, continuous verification and re-adjustment are necessary due to
changing requirements and material stream compositions. In this paper, we
introduce an approach for optimizing, recurrently monitoring and adjusting the
process parameters of a sensor-based sorting system. Based on Bayesian
Optimization, Gaussian process regression models are used as surrogate models
to achieve specific requirements for system behavior with the uncertainties
contained therein. This method minimizes the number of necessary experiments
while simultaneously considering two possible optimization targets based on the
requirements for both material output streams. In addition, uncertainties are
considered during determining sorting accuracies in the model calculation. We
evaluated the method with three example process parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统交叉验证可能因数据子集不具代表性而导致性能估计偏差的问题。

Method: 提出结合Mini Batch K-Means和类分层的交叉验证技术，并在20个数据集上对比不同策略的偏差、方差和计算成本。

Result: Mini Batch K-Means加类分层在平衡数据集上表现最佳，但不显著降低计算成本；传统分层交叉验证在不平衡数据集上更优。

Conclusion: 研究改进了预测模型评估策略，强调了聚类数据分割的潜力，并肯定了传统分层交叉验证的有效性。

Abstract: Cross-validation plays a fundamental role in Machine Learning, enabling
robust evaluation of model performance and preventing overestimation on
training and validation data. However, one of its drawbacks is the potential to
create data subsets (folds) that do not adequately represent the diversity of
the original dataset, which can lead to biased performance estimates. The
objective of this work is to deepen the investigation of cluster-based
cross-validation strategies by analyzing the performance of different
clustering algorithms through experimental comparison. Additionally, a new
cross-validation technique that combines Mini Batch K-Means with class
stratification is proposed. Experiments were conducted on 20 datasets (both
balanced and imbalanced) using four supervised learning algorithms, comparing
cross-validation strategies in terms of bias, variance, and computational cost.
The technique that uses Mini Batch K-Means with class stratification
outperformed others in terms of bias and variance on balanced datasets, though
it did not significantly reduce computational cost. On imbalanced datasets,
traditional stratified cross-validation consistently performed better, showing
lower bias, variance, and computational cost, making it a safe choice for
performance evaluation in scenarios with class imbalance. In the comparison of
different clustering algorithms, no single algorithm consistently stood out as
superior. Overall, this work contributes to improving predictive model
evaluation strategies by providing a deeper understanding of the potential of
cluster-based data splitting techniques and reaffirming the effectiveness of
well-established strategies like stratified cross-validation. Moreover, it
highlights perspectives for increasing the robustness and reliability of model
evaluations, especially in datasets with clustering characteristics.

TL;DR: CS-SHRED是一种结合压缩感知（CS）和浅层循环解码器（SHRED）的新型深度学习架构，用于从不完整、压缩或损坏的数据中重建时空动态。该方法通过创新的自适应损失函数和L1正则化，显著提高了重建精度和鲁棒性。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在稀疏传感器布置、噪声测量和不完整数据采集等挑战性场景下，传统方法难以有效重建时空动态的问题。

Method: 将CS技术与SHRED架构结合，采用基于批量的前向框架和L1正则化，并设计自适应损失函数动态结合MSE和MAE，辅以分段SNR正则化。

Result: 在多种复杂问题（如流体流动、湿度场等）中，CS-SHRED相比传统SHRED显著提高了重建保真度（SSIM、PSNR等指标改善），并增强了对噪声和异常值的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CS-SHRED通过联合训练的CS和SHRED架构及SNR引导的自适应损失函数，为环境、气候和科学数据分析提供了高效工具。

Abstract: We present $\textbf{CS-SHRED}$, a novel deep learning architecture that
integrates Compressed Sensing (CS) into a Shallow Recurrent Decoder
($\textbf{SHRED}$) to reconstruct spatiotemporal dynamics from incomplete,
compressed, or corrupted data. Our approach introduces two key innovations.
First, by incorporating CS techniques into the $\textbf{SHRED}$ architecture,
our method leverages a batch-based forward framework with $\ell_1$
regularization to robustly recover signals even in scenarios with sparse sensor
placements, noisy measurements, and incomplete sensor acquisitions. Second, an
adaptive loss function dynamically combines Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean
Absolute Error (MAE) terms with a piecewise Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
regularization, which suppresses noise and outliers in low-SNR regions while
preserving fine-scale features in high-SNR regions.
  We validate $\textbf{CS-SHRED}$ on challenging problems including
viscoelastic fluid flows, maximum specific humidity fields, sea surface
temperature distributions, and rotating turbulent flows. Compared to the
traditional $\textbf{SHRED}$ approach, $\textbf{CS-SHRED}$ achieves
significantly higher reconstruction fidelity - as demonstrated by improved SSIM
and PSNR values, lower normalized errors, and enhanced LPIPS scores-thereby
providing superior preservation of small-scale structures and increased
robustness against noise and outliers.
  Our results underscore the advantages of the jointly trained CS and SHRED
design architecture which includes an LSTM sequence model for characterizing
the temporal evolution with a shallow decoder network (SDN) for modeling the
high-dimensional state space. The SNR-guided adaptive loss function for the
spatiotemporal data recovery establishes $\textbf{CS-SHRED}$ as a promising
tool for a wide range of applications in environmental, climatic, and
scientific data analyses.

Result: 在“Glass”数据集和用户研究中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 新方法显著提高了随机森林的可解释性，无需分析每棵树或依赖简化总结。

Abstract: Random forests are a machine learning method used to automatically classify
datasets and consist of a multitude of decision trees. While these random
forests often have higher performance and generalize better than a single
decision tree, they are also harder to interpret. This paper presents a
visualization method and system to increase interpretability of random forests.
We cluster similar trees which enables users to interpret how the model
performs in general without needing to analyze each individual decision tree in
detail, or interpret an oversimplified summary of the full forest. To
meaningfully cluster the decision trees, we introduce a new distance metric
that takes into account both the decision rules as well as the predictions of a
pair of decision trees. We also propose two new visualization methods that
visualize both clustered and individual decision trees: (1) The Feature Plot,
which visualizes the topological position of features in the decision trees,
and (2) the Rule Plot, which visualizes the decision rules of the decision
trees. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through a case study on the
"Glass" dataset, which is a relatively complex standard machine learning
dataset, as well as a small user study.

Conclusion: MH-pFedHN为模型异构的个性化联邦学习提供了高效、隐私保护的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in personalized federated learning have focused on addressing
client model heterogeneity. However, most existing methods still require
external data, rely on model decoupling, or adopt partial learning strategies,
which can limit their practicality and scalability. In this paper, we revisit
hypernetwork-based methods and leverage their strong generalization
capabilities to design a simple yet effective framework for heterogeneous
personalized federated learning. Specifically, we propose MH-pFedHN, which
leverages a server-side hypernetwork that takes client-specific embedding
vectors as input and outputs personalized parameters tailored to each client's
heterogeneous model. To promote knowledge sharing and reduce computation, we
introduce a multi-head structure within the hypernetwork, allowing clients with
similar model sizes to share heads. Furthermore, we further propose
MH-pFedHNGD, which integrates an optional lightweight global model to improve
generalization. Our framework does not rely on external datasets and does not
require disclosure of client model architectures, thereby offering enhanced
privacy and flexibility. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks and model
settings demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive accuracy, strong
generalization, and serves as a robust baseline for future research in
model-heterogeneous personalized federated learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决设施选址和路径优化（FLPO）这类NP难问题，其混合离散-连续结构和高度非凸目标使其难以优化。

Method: 整合最大熵原理（MEP）与最短路径网络（SPN），一种置换不变的编码器-解码器，近似MEP解并支持高效梯度优化。

Result: SPN比MEP基线快100倍，最优性差距约6%；FLPO方法比元启发式基线成本低10倍，速度更快，与Gurobi最优成本匹配但快1500倍。

Conclusion: 结构化深度模型在大规模混合整数优化任务中表现出色，确立了ParaSDM问题的新标杆。

Abstract: We propose a scalable deep learning framework for parametrized sequential
decision-making (ParaSDM), where multiple agents jointly optimize discrete
action policies and shared continuous parameters. A key subclass of this
setting arises in Facility-Location and Path Optimization (FLPO), where
multi-agent systems must simultaneously determine optimal routes and facility
locations, aiming to minimize the cumulative transportation cost within the
network. FLPO problems are NP-hard due to their mixed discrete-continuous
structure and highly non-convex objective. To address this, we integrate the
Maximum Entropy Principle (MEP) with a neural policy model called the Shortest
Path Network (SPN)-a permutation-invariant encoder-decoder that approximates
the MEP solution while enabling efficient gradient-based optimization over
shared parameters. The SPN achieves up to 100$\times$ speedup in policy
inference and gradient computation compared to MEP baselines, with an average
optimality gap of approximately 6% across a wide range of problem sizes. Our
FLPO approach yields over 10$\times$ lower cost than metaheuristic baselines
while running significantly faster, and matches Gurobi's optimal cost with
annealing at a 1500$\times$ speedup-establishing a new state of the art for
ParaSDM problems. These results highlight the power of structured deep models
for solving large-scale mixed-integer optimization tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在移动和边缘设备上部署深度神经网络（DNNs）时，模型效率优化至关重要。混合精度量化虽优于均匀量化，但找到每层最优精度仍具挑战性。

Method: MSQ采用圆钳位量化器实现权重的可微分计算，并通过正则化诱导稀疏性，同时利用Hessian信息同时修剪多个最低有效位（LSBs）。

Result: 实验表明，MSQ可减少8倍可训练参数和86%训练时间，同时保持竞争性精度和压缩率。

Conclusion: MSQ是资源受限设备上训练高效DNNs的实用解决方案。

Abstract: As deep neural networks (DNNs) see increased deployment on mobile and edge
devices, optimizing model efficiency has become crucial. Mixed-precision
quantization is widely favored, as it offers a superior balance between
efficiency and accuracy compared to uniform quantization. However, finding the
optimal precision for each layer is challenging. Recent studies utilizing
bit-level sparsity have shown promise, yet they often introduce substantial
training complexity and high GPU memory requirements. In this paper, we propose
Memory-Efficient Bit Sparsification Quantization (MSQ), a novel approach that
addresses these limitations. MSQ applies a round-clamp quantizer to enable
differentiable computation of the least significant bits (LSBs) from model
weights. It further employs regularization to induce sparsity in these LSBs,
enabling effective precision reduction without explicit bit-level parameter
splitting. Additionally, MSQ incorporates Hessian information, allowing the
simultaneous pruning of multiple LSBs to further enhance training efficiency.
Experimental results show that MSQ achieves up to 8.00x reduction in trainable
parameters and up to 86% reduction in training time compared to previous
bit-level quantization, while maintaining competitive accuracy and compression
rates. This makes it a practical solution for training efficient DNNs on
resource-constrained devices.

Conclusion: Spec-VLA展示了推测执行在VLA预测中的潜力，为未来更广泛应用提供了基础。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have made substantial progress by
leveraging the robust capabilities of Visual Language Models (VLMs). However,
VLMs' significant parameter size and autoregressive (AR) decoding nature impose
considerable computational demands on VLA models. While Speculative Decoding
(SD) has shown efficacy in accelerating Large Language Models (LLMs) by
incorporating efficient drafting and parallel verification, allowing multiple
tokens to be generated in one forward pass, its application to VLA models
remains unexplored. This work introduces Spec-VLA, an SD framework designed to
accelerate VLA models. Due to the difficulty of the action prediction task and
the greedy decoding mechanism of the VLA models, the direct application of the
advanced SD framework to the VLA prediction task yields a minor speed
improvement. To boost the generation speed, we propose an effective mechanism
to relax acceptance utilizing the relative distances represented by the action
tokens of the VLA model. Empirical results across diverse test scenarios affirm
the effectiveness of the Spec-VLA framework, and further analysis substantiates
the impact of our proposed strategies, which enhance the acceptance length by
44%, achieving 1.42 times speedup compared with the OpenVLA baseline, without
compromising the success rate. The success of the Spec-VLA framework highlights
the potential for broader application of speculative execution in VLA
prediction scenarios.

Abstract: Gradient-based adversarial attacks using the Cross-Entropy (CE) loss often
suffer from overestimation due to relative errors in gradient computation
induced by floating-point arithmetic. This paper provides a rigorous
theoretical analysis of these errors, conducting the first comprehensive study
of floating-point computation errors in gradient-based attacks across four
distinct scenarios: (i) unsuccessful untargeted attacks, (ii) successful
untargeted attacks, (iii) unsuccessful targeted attacks, and (iv) successful
targeted attacks. We establish theoretical foundations characterizing the
behavior of relative numerical errors under different attack conditions,
revealing previously unknown patterns in gradient computation instability, and
identify floating-point underflow and rounding as key contributors. Building on
this insight, we propose the Theoretical MIFPE (T-MIFPE) loss function, which
incorporates an optimal scaling factor $T = t^*$ to minimize the impact of
floating-point errors, thereby enhancing the accuracy of gradient computation
in adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and
CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate that T-MIFPE outperforms existing loss
functions, including CE, C\&W, DLR, and MIFPE, in terms of attack potency and
robustness evaluation accuracy.

Conclusion: RANA有效解决了网络对齐中的噪声问题，提高了模型鲁棒性和对齐准确性。

Abstract: Network alignment has attracted widespread attention in various fields.
However, most existing works mainly focus on the problem of label sparsity,
while overlooking the issue of noise in network alignment, which can
substantially undermine model performance. Such noise mainly includes
structural noise from noisy edges and labeling noise caused by human-induced
and process-driven errors. To address these problems, we propose RANA, a Robust
Active learning framework for noisy Network Alignment. RANA effectively tackles
both structure noise and label noise while addressing the sparsity of anchor
link annotations, which can improve the robustness of network alignment models.
Specifically, RANA introduces the proposed Noise-aware Selection Module and the
Label Denoising Module to address structural noise and labeling noise,
respectively. In the first module, we design a noise-aware maximization
objective to select node pairs, incorporating a cleanliness score to address
structural noise. In the second module, we propose a novel multi-source fusion
denoising strategy that leverages model and twin node pairs labeling to provide
more accurate labels for node pairs. Empirical results on three real-world
datasets demonstrate that RANA outperforms state-of-the-art active
learning-based methods in alignment accuracy. Our code is available at

Conclusion: RCR-AF是一种有效提升模型鲁棒性和泛化能力的新型激活函数。

Abstract: Despite their widespread success, deep neural networks remain critically
vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing significant risks in safety-sensitive
applications. This paper investigates activation functions as a crucial yet
underexplored component for enhancing model robustness. We propose a Rademacher
Complexity Reduction Activation Function (RCR-AF), a novel activation function
designed to improve both generalization and adversarial resilience. RCR-AF
uniquely combines the advantages of GELU (including smoothness, gradient
stability, and negative information retention) with ReLU's desirable
monotonicity, while simultaneously controlling both model sparsity and capacity
through built-in clipping mechanisms governed by two hyperparameters, $\alpha$
and $\gamma$. Our theoretical analysis, grounded in Rademacher complexity,
demonstrates that these parameters directly modulate the model's Rademacher
complexity, offering a principled approach to enhance robustness. Comprehensive
empirical evaluations show that RCR-AF consistently outperforms widely-used
alternatives (ReLU, GELU, and Swish) in both clean accuracy under standard
training and in adversarial robustness within adversarial training paradigms.

Conclusion: Proto-EVFL是VFL中首个双层优化框架，具有1/√T的收敛速度，有效解决了类别不平衡问题。

Abstract: In vertical federated learning (VFL), multiple enterprises address aligned
sample scarcity by leveraging massive locally unaligned samples to facilitate
collaborative learning. However, unaligned samples across different parties in
VFL can be extremely class-imbalanced, leading to insufficient feature
representation and limited model prediction space. Specifically,
class-imbalanced problems consist of intra-party class imbalance and
inter-party class imbalance, which can further cause local model bias and
feature contribution inconsistency issues, respectively. To address the above
challenges, we propose Proto-EVFL, an enhanced VFL framework via dual
prototypes. We first introduce class prototypes for each party to learn
relationships between classes in the latent space, allowing the active party to
predict unseen classes. We further design a probabilistic dual prototype
learning scheme to dynamically select unaligned samples by conditional optimal
transport cost with class prior probability. Moreover, a mixed prior guided
module guides this selection process by combining local and global class prior
probabilities. Finally, we adopt an \textit{adaptive gated feature aggregation
strategy} to mitigate feature contribution inconsistency by dynamically
weighting and aggregating local features across different parties. We proved
that Proto-EVFL, as the first bi-level optimization framework in VFL, has a
convergence rate of 1/\sqrt T. Extensive experiments on various datasets
validate the superiority of our Proto-EVFL. Even in a zero-shot scenario with
one unseen class, it outperforms baselines by at least 6.97%

Result: 在图像分类和生成任务中显著缩小了现有方法与精确遗忘的差距。

Conclusion: LoReUn是一种简单高效的插件策略，能有效提升文本到图像扩散模型的安全性。

Abstract: Recent generative models face significant risks of producing harmful content,
which has underscored the importance of machine unlearning (MU) as a critical
technique for eliminating the influence of undesired data. However, existing MU
methods typically assign the same weight to all data to be forgotten, which
makes it difficult to effectively forget certain data that is harder to unlearn
than others. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that the loss of data
itself can implicitly reflect its varying difficulty. Building on this insight,
we introduce Loss-based Reweighting Unlearning (LoReUn), a simple yet effective
plug-and-play strategy that dynamically reweights data during the unlearning
process with minimal additional computational overhead. Our approach
significantly reduces the gap between existing MU methods and exact unlearning
in both image classification and generation tasks, effectively enhancing the
prevention of harmful content generation in text-to-image diffusion models.

Abstract: Forecast reconciliation, an ex-post technique applied to forecasts that must
satisfy constraints, has been a prominent topic in the forecasting literature
over the past two decades. Recently, several efforts have sought to extend
reconciliation methods to the probabilistic settings. Nevertheless, formal
theorems demonstrating error reduction in nonlinear contexts, analogous to
those presented in Panagiotelis et al.(2021), are still lacking. This paper
addresses that gap by establishing such theorems for various classes of
nonlinear hypersurfaces and vector-valued functions. Specifically, we derive an
exact analog of Theorem 3.1 from Panagiotelis et al.(2021) for hypersurfaces
with constant-sign curvature. Additionally, we provide probabilistic guarantees
for the broader case of hypersurfaces with non-constant-sign curvature and for
general vector-valued functions. To support reproducibility and practical
adoption, we release a JAX-based Python package, \emph{to be released upon
publication}, implementing the presented theorems and reconciliation
procedures.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is an increasingly critical task within drug
discovery and development. Typically, neural networks can learn molecular
properties using graph-based, language-based or feature-based methods. Recent
advances in natural language processing have highlighted the capabilities of
neural networks to learn complex human language using masked language
modelling. These approaches to training large transformer-based deep learning
models have also been used to learn the language of molecules, as represented
by simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) strings. Here, we
present novel domain-specific text-to-text pretraining tasks that yield
improved performance in six classification-based molecular property prediction
benchmarks, relative to both traditional likelihood-based training and
previously proposed fine-tuning tasks. Through ablation studies, we show that
data and computational efficiency can be improved by using these
domain-specific pretraining tasks. Finally, the pretrained embeddings from the
model can be used as fixed inputs into a downstream machine learning classifier
and yield comparable performance to finetuning but with much lower
computational overhead.

toolkit integrates multiple graph representations of event sequences with
different choices of node- and graph-level attributes and in temporal
dependencies via edge weights, optimising prediction accuracy and stability for
balanced and unbalanced datasets. Extensive experiments show that GCNConv
models excel on unbalanced data, while all models perform consistently on
balanced data. Experiments also confirm the superior performance of HGCN(O)
over traditional approaches. Applications include Predictive Business Process

Motivation: 由于深度神经网络在边缘设备上的计算负载过重，网络压缩技术变得至关重要。现有方法在部署时仍面临挑战。

Method: 提出分数阶高斯滤波器（FGFs），利用Grünwald-Letnikov分数阶导数近似分数阶微分方程，并结合自适应非结构化剪枝（AUP）实现更高压缩比。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet2012上，FGFP框架在模型大小减少85.2%和69.1%的同时，精度仅下降1.52%和1.63%。

Conclusion: FGFP框架在压缩深度神经网络方面表现出色，适用于边缘设备部署。

Abstract: Network compression techniques have become increasingly important in recent
years because the loads of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are heavy for edge
devices in real-world applications. While many methods compress neural network
parameters, deploying these models on edge devices remains challenging. To
address this, we propose the fractional Gaussian filter and pruning (FGFP)
framework, which integrates fractional-order differential calculus and Gaussian
function to construct fractional Gaussian filters (FGFs). To reduce the
computational complexity of fractional-order differential operations, we
introduce Gr\"unwald-Letnikov fractional derivatives to approximate the
fractional-order differential equation. The number of parameters for each
kernel in FGF is minimized to only seven. Beyond the architecture of Fractional
Gaussian Filters, our FGFP framework also incorporates Adaptive Unstructured
Pruning (AUP) to achieve higher compression ratios. Experiments on various
architectures and benchmarks show that our FGFP framework outperforms recent
methods in accuracy and compression. On CIFAR-10, ResNet-20 achieves only a
1.52% drop in accuracy while reducing the model size by 85.2%. On ImageNet2012,
ResNet-50 achieves only a 1.63% drop in accuracy while reducing the model size

Result: AutoML-DEC优于传统聚类方法，BN模型准确率达95.6%，SUMO验证显示预测与实际高度一致。

Conclusion: 所提框架能有效预测事故引发的拥堵，为城市交通管理提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Traffic congestion due to uncertainties, such as accidents, is a significant
issue in urban areas, as the ripple effect of accidents causes longer delays,
increased emissions, and safety concerns. To address this issue, we propose a
robust framework for predicting the impact of accidents on congestion. We
implement Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)-enhanced Deep Embedding
Clustering (DEC) to assign congestion labels to accident data and predict
congestion probability using a Bayesian Network (BN). The Simulation of Urban
Mobility (SUMO) simulation is utilized to evaluate the correctness of BN
predictions using evidence-based scenarios. Results demonstrate that the
AutoML-enhanced DEC has outperformed traditional clustering approaches. The
performance of the proposed BN model achieved an overall accuracy of 95.6%,
indicating its ability to understand the complex relationship of accidents
causing congestion. Validation in SUMO with evidence-based scenarios
demonstrated that the BN model's prediction of congestion states closely
matches those of SUMO, indicating the high reliability of the proposed BN model
in ensuring smooth urban mobility.

Result: 实验表明，词频分布符合Zipf定律时，模型性能最佳，且该方法适用于NLP、基因组学和化学领域。

Conclusion: Zipf对齐是一种稳健且通用的词汇量选择标准，能提升模型效率和效果。

Abstract: Tokenization is a fundamental step in natural language processing (NLP) and
other sequence modeling domains, where the choice of vocabulary size
significantly impacts model performance. Despite its importance, selecting an
optimal vocabulary size remains underexplored, typically relying on heuristics
or dataset-specific choices. In this work, we propose a principled method for
determining the vocabulary size by analyzing token frequency distributions
through Zipf's law. We show that downstream task performance correlates with
how closely token distributions follow power-law behavior, and that aligning
with Zipfian scaling improves both model efficiency and effectiveness.
Extensive experiments across NLP, genomics, and chemistry demonstrate that
models consistently achieve peak performance when the token distribution
closely adheres to Zipf's law, establishing Zipfian alignment as a robust and
generalizable criterion for vocabulary size selection.

demonstrate that the linear approximation of the coupled Kuramoto oscillator
model leads to the inverse matrix solution. Numerical simulations validate the
theoretical framework, and we examine the parameter regimes that computation

Conclusion: DeepC4为大规模空间信息审计提供了一种新的深度学习方法，有助于实现2030年全球可持续发展目标。

Abstract: To understand our global progress for sustainable development and disaster
risk reduction in many developing economies, two recent major initiatives - the
Uniform African Exposure Dataset of the Global Earthquake Model (GEM)
Foundation and the Modelling Exposure through Earth Observation Routines
(METEOR) Project - implemented classical spatial disaggregation techniques to
generate large-scale mapping of urban morphology using the information from
various satellite imagery and its derivatives, geospatial datasets of the built
environment, and subnational census statistics. However, the local discrepancy
with well-validated census statistics and the propagated model uncertainties
remain a challenge in such coarse-to-fine-grained mapping problems,
specifically constrained by weak and conditional label supervision. Therefore,
we present Deep Conditional Census-Constrained Clustering (DeepC4), a novel
deep learning-based spatial disaggregation approach that incorporates local
census statistics as cluster-level constraints while considering multiple
conditional label relationships in a joint multitask learning of the patterns
of satellite imagery. To demonstrate, compared to GEM and METEOR, we enhanced
the quality of Rwandan maps of urban morphology, specifically building exposure
and physical vulnerability, at the third-level administrative unit from the
2022 census. As the world approaches the conclusion of our global frameworks in
2030, our work has offered a new deep learning-based mapping technique towards
a spatial auditing of our existing coarse-grained derived information at large

Conclusion: VAR为机器学习模型比较提供了有效的可视化解决方案。

Abstract: Evaluating the performance of closely matched machine learning(ML) models
under specific conditions has long been a focus of researchers in the field of
machine learning. The Rashomon set is a collection of closely matched ML
models, encompassing a wide range of models with similar accuracies but
different structures. Traditionally, the analysis of these sets has focused on
vertical structural analysis, which involves comparing the corresponding
features at various levels within the ML models. However, there has been a lack
of effective visualization methods for horizontally comparing multiple models
with specific features. We propose the VAR visualization solution. VAR uses
visualization to perform comparisons of ML models within the Rashomon set. This
solution combines heatmaps and scatter plots to facilitate the comparison. With
the help of VAR, ML model developers can identify the optimal model under
specific conditions and better understand the Rashomon set's overall
characteristics.

Result: 在多个语言模型上，RLDP显著降低了困惑度（1.3-30.5%）并提升了下游任务性能（平均5.6%），同时节省了梯度更新预算（平均加速71%）。

Conclusion: RLDP在保证相同隐私预算的前提下，显著提升了模型性能和训练效率。

Abstract: The tension between data privacy and model utility has become the defining
bottleneck for the practical deployment of large language models (LLMs) trained
on sensitive corpora including healthcare. Differentially private stochastic
gradient descent (DP-SGD) guarantees formal privacy, yet it does so at a
pronounced cost: gradients are forcibly clipped and perturbed with noise,
degrading sample efficiency and final accuracy. Numerous variants have been
proposed to soften this trade-off, but they all share a handicap: their control
knobs are hard-coded, global, and oblivious to the evolving optimization
landscape. Consequently, practitioners are forced either to over-spend privacy
budget in pursuit of utility, or to accept mediocre models in order to stay
within privacy constraints. We present RLDP, the first framework to cast DP
optimization itself as a closed-loop control problem amenable to modern deep
reinforcement learning (RL). RLDP continuously senses rich statistics of the
learning dynamics and acts by selecting fine-grained per parameter
gradient-clipping thresholds as well as the magnitude of injected Gaussian
noise. A soft actor-critic (SAC) hyper-policy is trained online during language
model fine-tuning; it learns, from scratch, how to allocate the privacy budget
where it matters and when it matters. Across more than 1,600 ablation
experiments on GPT2-small, Llama-1B, Llama-3B, and Mistral-7B, RLDP delivers
perplexity reductions of 1.3-30.5% (mean 5.4%) and an average 5.6% downstream
utility gain. RLDP reaches each baseline's final utility after only 13-43% of
the gradient-update budget (mean speed-up 71%), all while honoring the same
($\epsilon$, $\delta$)-DP contract and exhibiting equal or lower susceptibility
to membership-inference and canary-extraction attacks.

Conclusion: 该方法成功地从复杂数据中提取了简单且高精度的分类规则，为单调矩阵的识别提供了实用标准。

Abstract: This work demonstrates a methodology for using deep learning to discover
simple, practical criteria for classifying matrices based on abstract algebraic
properties. By combining a high-performance neural network with explainable AI
(XAI) techniques, we can distill a model's learned strategy into
human-interpretable rules. We apply this approach to the challenging case of
monotone matrices, defined by the condition that their inverses are entrywise
nonnegative. Despite their simple definition, an easy characterization in terms
of the matrix elements or the derived parameters is not known. Here, we
present, to the best of our knowledge, the first systematic machine-learning
approach for deriving a practical criterion that distinguishes monotone from
non-monotone matrices. After establishing a labelled dataset by randomly
generated monotone and non-monotone matrices uniformly on $(-1,1)$, we employ
deep neural network algorithms for classifying the matrices as monotone or
non-monotone, using both their entries and a comprehensive set of matrix
features. By saliency methods, such as integrated gradients, we identify among
all features, two matrix parameters which alone provide sufficient information
for the matrix classification, with $95\%$ accuracy, namely the absolute values
of the two lowest-order coefficients, $c_0$ and $c_1$ of the matrix's
characteristic polynomial. A data-driven study of 18,000 random $7\times7$
matrices shows that the monotone class obeys $\lvert c_{0}/c_{1}\rvert\le0.18$
with probability $>99.98\%$; because $\lvert c_{0}/c_{1}\rvert =
1/\mathrm{tr}(A^{-1})$ for monotone $A$, this is equivalent to the simple bound
$\mathrm{tr}(A^{-1})\ge5.7$.

Conclusion: 深度学习为理解细胞分裂模式提供了新途径，并可能生成新的研究假设。

Abstract: The positioning of new cellular walls during cell division plays a key role
in shaping plant tissue organization. The influence of cell geometry on the
positioning of division planes has been previously captured into various
geometrical rules. Accordingly, linking cell shape to division orientation has
relied on the comparison between observed division patterns and predictions
under specific rules. The need to define a priori the tested rules is a
fundamental limitation of this hypothesis-driven approach. As an alternative,
we introduce a data-based approach to investigate the relation between cell
geometry and division plane positioning, exploiting the ability of deep neural
network to learn complex relationships across multidimensional spaces. Adopting
an image-based cell representation, we show how division patterns can be
learned and predicted from mother cell geometry using a UNet architecture
modified to operate on cell masks. Using synthetic data and A. thaliana embryo
cells, we evaluate the model performances on a wide range of diverse cell
shapes and division patterns. We find that the trained model accounted for
embryo division patterns that were previously irreconcilable under existing
geometrical rules. Our work shows the potential of deep networks to understand
cell division patterns and to generate new hypotheses on the control of cell
division positioning.

Conclusion: H2Tune有效解决了HHFFT的挑战，性能显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Different from existing federated fine-tuning (FFT) methods for foundation
models, hybrid heterogeneous federated fine-tuning (HHFFT) is an under-explored
scenario where clients exhibit double heterogeneity in model architectures and
downstream tasks. This hybrid heterogeneity introduces two significant
challenges: 1) heterogeneous matrix aggregation, where clients adopt different
large-scale foundation models based on their task requirements and resource
limitations, leading to dimensional mismatches during LoRA parameter
aggregation; and 2) multi-task knowledge interference, where local shared
parameters, trained with both task-shared and task-specific knowledge, cannot
ensure only task-shared knowledge is transferred between clients. To address
these challenges, we propose H2Tune, a federated foundation model fine-tuning
with hybrid heterogeneity. Our framework H2Tune consists of three key
components: (i) sparsified triple matrix decomposition to align hidden
dimensions across clients through constructing rank-consistent middle matrices,
with adaptive sparsification based on client resources; (ii) relation-guided
matrix layer alignment to handle heterogeneous layer structures and
representation capabilities; and (iii) alternating task-knowledge
disentanglement mechanism to decouple shared and specific knowledge of local
model parameters through alternating optimization. Theoretical analysis proves
a convergence rate of O(1/\sqrt{T}). Extensive experiments show our method
achieves up to 15.4% accuracy improvement compared to state-of-the-art
baselines. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法为转导学习中的先验概率偏移问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Transductive learning is a supervised machine learning task in which, unlike
in traditional inductive learning, the unlabelled data that require labelling
are a finite set and are available at training time. Similarly to inductive
learning contexts, transductive learning contexts may be affected by dataset
shift, i.e., may be such that the IID assumption does not hold. We here propose
a method, tailored to transductive classification contexts, for performing
model selection (i.e., hyperparameter optimisation) when the data exhibit prior
probability shift, an important type of dataset shift typical of anti-causal
learning problems. In our proposed method the hyperparameters can be optimised
directly on the unlabelled data to which the trained classifier must be
applied; this is unlike traditional model selection methods, that are based on
performing cross-validation on the labelled training data. We provide
experimental results that show the benefits brought about by our method.

Conclusion: 量子计算在数据受限的组合问题中具有潜力，PQK为CAR T细胞优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells are T-cells engineered to recognize
and kill specific tumor cells. Through their extracellular domains, CAR T-cells
bind tumor cell antigens which triggers CAR T activation and proliferation.
These processes are regulated by co-stimulatory domains present in the
intracellular region of the CAR T-cell. Through integrating novel signaling
components into the co-stimulatory domains, it is possible to modify CAR T-cell
phenotype. Identifying and experimentally testing new CAR constructs based on
libraries of co-stimulatory domains is nontrivial given the vast combinatorial
space defined by such libraries. This leads to a highly data constrained,
poorly explored combinatorial problem, where the experiments undersample all
possible combinations. We propose a quantum approach using a Projected Quantum
Kernel (PQK) to address this challenge. PQK operates by embedding classical
data into a high dimensional Hilbert space and employs a kernel method to
measure sample similarity. Using 61 qubits on a gate-based quantum computer, we
demonstrate the largest PQK application to date and an enhancement in the
classification performance over purely classical machine learning methods for
CAR T cytotoxicity prediction. Importantly, we show improved learning for
specific signaling domains and domain positions, particularly where there was
lower information highlighting the potential for quantum computing in
data-constrained problems.

Abstract: Distilling large neural networks into simple, human-readable symbolic
formulas is a promising path toward trustworthy and interpretable AI. However,
this process is often brittle, as the complex functions learned by standard
networks are poor targets for symbolic discovery, resulting in low-fidelity
student models. In this work, we propose a novel training paradigm to address
this challenge. Instead of passively distilling a pre-trained network, we
introduce a \textbf{Jacobian-based regularizer} that actively encourages the
``teacher'' network to learn functions that are not only accurate but also
inherently smoother and more amenable to distillation. We demonstrate through
extensive experiments on a suite of real-world regression benchmarks that our
method is highly effective. By optimizing the regularization strength for each
problem, we improve the $R^2$ score of the final distilled symbolic model by an
average of \textbf{120\% (relative)} compared to the standard distillation
pipeline, all while maintaining the teacher's predictive accuracy. Our work
presents a practical and principled method for significantly improving the
fidelity of interpretable models extracted from complex neural networks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过估计混淆矩阵来监控医学图像分类模型性能的方法，并在真实和模拟数据偏移下进行了验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于目标数据集通常缺乏真实标签，直接评估模型性能不可行，现有方法主要依赖置信度分数估计准确率，但在临床领域（如类别不平衡和数据偏移常见）中缺乏评估。

Method: 扩展了现有性能预测方法，直接估计完整的混淆矩阵，并在真实和模拟数据偏移下进行测试。

Result: 提出的方法在医学图像数据偏移下可靠地预测了临床相关计数指标，但也暴露了现有技术的局限性。

Conclusion: 需进一步理解真实部署环境，以改进医学AI模型的性能监控技术。

Abstract: Performance monitoring is essential for safe clinical deployment of image
classification models. However, because ground-truth labels are typically
unavailable in the target dataset, direct assessment of real-world model
performance is infeasible. State-of-the-art performance estimation methods
address this by leveraging confidence scores to estimate the target accuracy.
Despite being a promising direction, the established methods mainly estimate
the model's accuracy and are rarely evaluated in a clinical domain, where
strong class imbalances and dataset shifts are common. Our contributions are
twofold: First, we introduce generalisations of existing performance prediction
methods that directly estimate the full confusion matrix. Then, we benchmark
their performance on chest x-ray data in real-world distribution shifts as well
as simulated covariate and prevalence shifts. The proposed confusion matrix
estimation methods reliably predicted clinically relevant counting metrics on
medical images under distribution shifts. However, our simulated shift
scenarios exposed important failure modes of current performance estimation
techniques, calling for a better understanding of real-world deployment
contexts when implementing these performance monitoring techniques for
postmarket surveillance of medical AI models.

Abstract: Density operators, quantum generalizations of probability distributions, are
gaining prominence in machine learning due to their foundational role in
quantum computing. Generative modeling based on density operator models
(\textbf{DOMs}) is an emerging field, but existing training algorithms -- such
as those for the Quantum Boltzmann Machine -- do not scale to real-world data,
such as the MNIST dataset. The Expectation-Maximization algorithm has played a
fundamental role in enabling scalable training of probabilistic latent variable
models on real-world datasets. \textit{In this paper, we develop an
Expectation-Maximization framework to learn latent variable models defined
through \textbf{DOMs} on classical hardware, with resources comparable to those
used for probabilistic models, while scaling to real-world data.} However,
designing such an algorithm is nontrivial due to the absence of a well-defined
quantum analogue to conditional probability, which complicates the Expectation
step. To overcome this, we reformulate the Expectation step as a quantum
information projection (QIP) problem and show that the Petz Recovery Map
provides a solution under sufficient conditions. Using this formulation, we
introduce the Density Operator Expectation Maximization (DO-EM) algorithm -- an
iterative Minorant-Maximization procedure that optimizes a quantum evidence
lower bound. We show that the \textbf{DO-EM} algorithm ensures non-decreasing
log-likelihood across iterations for a broad class of models. Finally, we
present Quantum Interleaved Deep Boltzmann Machines (\textbf{QiDBMs}), a
\textbf{DOM} that can be trained with the same resources as a DBM. When trained
with \textbf{DO-EM} under Contrastive Divergence, a \textbf{QiDBM} outperforms
larger classical DBMs in image generation on the MNIST dataset, achieving a
40--60\% reduction in the Fr\'echet Inception Distance.

Conclusion: G-Core在RLHF训练中取得了先进成果，为未来大规模人类对齐模型的研究和部署奠定了基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become an increasingly
popular paradigm for training large language models (LLMs) and diffusion
models. While existing RLHF training systems have enabled significant progress,
they often face challenges in scaling to multi-modal and diffusion workflows
and adapting to dynamic workloads. In particular, current approaches may
encounter limitations in controller scalability, flexible resource placement,
and efficient orchestration when handling complex RLHF pipelines, especially in
scenarios involving dynamic sampling or generative reward modeling. In this
paper, we present \textbf{G-Core}, a simple, scalable, and balanced RLHF
training framework designed to address these challenges. G-Core introduces a
parallel controller programming model, enabling flexible and efficient
orchestration of complex RLHF workflows without the bottlenecks of a single
centralized controller. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic placement schema that
adaptively partitions resources and schedules workloads, significantly reducing
hardware idle time and improving utilization, even under highly variable
training conditions. G-Core has successfully trained models that support WeChat
product features serving a large-scale user base, demonstrating its
effectiveness and robustness in real-world scenarios. Our results show that
G-Core advances the state of the art in RLHF training, providing a solid
foundation for future research and deployment of large-scale, human-aligned
models.

Abstract: We present a foundation model-derived method to identify highly informative
tokens and events in electronic health records. Our approach considers incoming
data in the entire context of a patient's hospitalization and so can flag
anomalous events that rule-based approaches would consider within a normal
range. We demonstrate that the events our model flags are significant for
predicting downstream patient outcomes and that a fraction of events identified
as carrying little information can safely be dropped. Additionally, we show how
informativeness can help interpret the predictions of prognostic models trained
on foundation model-derived representations.

Abstract: Accurate quality prediction in multi-process manufacturing is critical for
industrial efficiency but hindered by three core challenges: time-lagged
process interactions, overlapping operations with mixed periodicity, and
inter-process dependencies in shared frequency bands. To address these, we
propose PAF-Net, a frequency decoupled time series prediction framework with
three key innovations: (1) A phase-correlation alignment method guided by
frequency domain energy to synchronize time-lagged quality series, resolving
temporal misalignment. (2) A frequency independent patch attention mechanism
paired with Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) decomposition to capture
heterogeneous operational features within individual series. (3) A frequency
decoupled cross attention module that suppresses noise from irrelevant
frequencies, focusing exclusively on meaningful dependencies within shared
bands. Experiments on 4 real-world datasets demonstrate PAF-Net's superiority.
It outperforms 10 well-acknowledged baselines by 7.06% lower MSE and 3.88%
lower MAE. Our code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习方法仅优化最终任务成功率，导致推理路径低效且泛化能力差，需要改进。

Method: RLVMR结合过程级监督和元推理行为奖励，通过标记认知步骤并提供规则化奖励，优化推理过程。

Result: 在ALFWorld和ScienceWorld基准测试中，RLVMR达到83.6%的成功率，推理质量和效率显著提升。

Conclusion: RLVMR通过改进推理过程，实现了更鲁棒、高效和可解释的智能体。

Abstract: The development of autonomous agents for complex, long-horizon tasks is a
central goal in AI. However, dominant training paradigms face a critical
limitation: reinforcement learning (RL) methods that optimize solely for final
task success often reinforce flawed or inefficient reasoning paths, a problem
we term inefficient exploration. This leads to agents that are brittle and fail
to generalize, as they learn to find solutions without learning how to reason
coherently. To address this, we introduce RLVMR, a novel framework that
integrates dense, process-level supervision into end-to-end RL by rewarding
verifiable, meta-reasoning behaviors. RLVMR equips an agent to explicitly tag
its cognitive steps, such as planning, exploration, and reflection, and
provides programmatic, rule-based rewards for actions that contribute to
effective problem-solving. These process-centric rewards are combined with the
final outcome signal and optimized using a critic-free policy gradient method.
On the challenging ALFWorld and ScienceWorld benchmarks, RLVMR achieves new
state-of-the-art results, with our 7B model reaching an 83.6% success rate on
the most difficult unseen task split. Our analysis confirms these gains stem
from improved reasoning quality, including significant reductions in redundant
actions and enhanced error recovery, leading to more robust, efficient, and
interpretable agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统去中心化PCA方法中智能体需访问全维度数据的限制，同时确保差分隐私。

Method: 通过共享局部嵌入和添加高斯噪声，实现隐私保护与协作估计，无需中央聚合器。

Result: 算法满足(ε,δ)-差分隐私，收敛速度快，在中等隐私区间（ε∈[2,5]）表现优异。

Conclusion: D-DP-PM在隐私与效用间取得良好平衡，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: We propose a novel Decentralized Differentially Private Power Method
(D-DP-PM) for performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in networked
multi-agent settings. Unlike conventional decentralized PCA approaches where
each agent accesses the full n-dimensional sample space, we address the
challenging scenario where each agent observes only a subset of dimensions
through row-wise data partitioning. Our method ensures
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-Differential Privacy (DP) while enabling collaborative
estimation of global eigenvectors across the network without requiring a
central aggregator. We achieve this by having agents share only local
embeddings of the current eigenvector iterate, leveraging both the inherent
privacy from random initialization and carefully calibrated Gaussian noise
additions. We prove that our algorithm satisfies the prescribed
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP guarantee and establish convergence rates that
explicitly characterize the impact of the network topology. Our theoretical
analysis, based on linear dynamics and high-dimensional probability theory,
provides tight bounds on both privacy and utility. Experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate that D-DP-PM achieves superior privacy-utility tradeoffs
compared to naive local DP approaches, with particularly strong performance in
moderate privacy regimes ($\epsilon\in[2, 5]$). The method converges rapidly,
allowing practitioners to trade iterations for enhanced privacy while
maintaining competitive utility.

Conclusion: 通过生成式采样和量子算法，显著优化了MDPs学习的遗憾边界，尤其在状态和动作空间依赖上表现更优。

Abstract: We propose novel classical and quantum online algorithms for learning
finite-horizon and infinite-horizon average-reward Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs). Our algorithms are based on a hybrid exploration-generative
reinforcement learning (RL) model wherein the agent can, from time to time,
freely interact with the environment in a generative sampling fashion, i.e., by
having access to a "simulator". By employing known classical and new quantum
algorithms for approximating optimal policies under a generative model within
our learning algorithms, we show that it is possible to avoid several paradigms
from RL like "optimism in the face of uncertainty" and "posterior sampling" and
instead compute and use optimal policies directly, which yields better regret
bounds compared to previous works. For finite-horizon MDPs, our quantum
algorithms obtain regret bounds which only depend logarithmically on the number
of time steps $T$, thus breaking the $O(\sqrt{T})$ classical barrier. This
matches the time dependence of the prior quantum works of Ganguly et al.
(arXiv'23) and Zhong et al. (ICML'24), but with improved dependence on other
parameters like state space size $S$ and action space size $A$. For
infinite-horizon MDPs, our classical and quantum bounds still maintain the
$O(\sqrt{T})$ dependence but with better $S$ and $A$ factors. Nonetheless, we
propose a novel measure of regret for infinite-horizon MDPs with respect to
which our quantum algorithms have $\operatorname{poly}\log{T}$ regret,
exponentially better compared to classical algorithms. Finally, we generalise
all of our results to compact state spaces.

Result: 算法复杂度降低，并可扩展至所有两人零和游戏。

Conclusion: 该算法在理论上优于线性规划求解器和随机分配概率的方法。

Abstract: The Colonel Blotto game, formulated by Emile Borel, involves players
allocating limited resources to multiple battlefields simultaneously, with the
winner being the one who allocates more resources to each battlefield.
Computation of the Nash equilibrium, including of two person, zero sum, mixed
strategy Colonel Blotto games have encountered issues of scalability and
complexity owing to their PPAD completeness. This paper proposes an algorithm
that computes the same value as the Nash equilibrium but cannot be
characterized by the Fixed point Theorems of Tarski, Kakutani and Brouwer. The
reduced complexity of the proposed algorithm is based on dispensing with the
need for computing both players Nash strategies in Colonel Blotto games. The
same algorithm can, therefore, be extended to all two person, zero sum games to
compute the value of the Nash equilibrium. The theoretical superiority of the
proposed algorithm over both LP solvers and another method that computes the
same value of the game as its Nash equilibrium by a random assignment of
probabilities to the active strategy set of the defending player, is also
proposed.

implementation with python code and with the Brian2 spiking neural simulator,
and outline a methodology for deploying the model on neuromorphic hardware
platforms, using an approximation of the second-order equations. This framework
offers a foundation for developing energy-efficient neural systems for

Abstract: A RL (Reinforcement Learning) algorithm was developed for command automation
onboard a 3U CubeSat. This effort focused on the implementation of macro
control action RL, a technique in which an onboard agent is provided with
compiled information based on live telemetry as its observation. The agent uses
this information to produce high-level actions, such as adjusting attitude to
solar pointing, which are then translated into control algorithms and executed
through lower-level instructions. Once trust in the onboard agent is
established, real-time environmental information can be leveraged for faster
response times and reduced reliance on ground control. The approach not only
focuses on developing an RL algorithm for a specific satellite but also sets a
precedent for integrating trusted AI into onboard systems. This research builds
on previous work in three areas: (1) RL algorithms for issuing high-level
commands that are translated into low-level executable instructions; (2) the
deployment of AI inference models interfaced with live operational systems,
particularly onboard spacecraft; and (3) strategies for building trust in AI
systems, especially for remote and autonomous applications. Existing RL
research for satellite control is largely limited to simulation-based
experiments; in this work, these techniques are tailored by constructing a
digital twin of a specific spacecraft and training the RL agent to issue macro
actions in this simulated environment. The policy of the trained agent is
copied to an isolated environment, where it is fed compiled information about
the satellite to make inference predictions, thereby demonstrating the RL
algorithm's validity on orbit without granting it command authority. This
process enables safe comparison of the algorithm's predictions against actual
satellite behavior and ensures operation within expected parameters.

Abstract: The increasing integration of IoT-connected devices in smart grids has
introduced new vulnerabilities at the distribution level. Of particular concern
is the potential for cyberattacks that exploit high-wattage IoT devices, such
as EV chargers, to manipulate local demand and destabilize the grid. While
previous studies have primarily focused on such attacks at the transmission
level, this paper investigates their feasibility and impact at the distribution
level. We examine how cyberattackers can target voltage-sensitive nodes,
especially those exposed by the presence of high-consumption devices, to cause
voltage deviation and service disruption. Our analysis demonstrates that
conventional grid protections are insufficient against these intelligent,
localized attacks. To address this, we propose resilience strategies using
distributed generation (DGs), exploring their role in preemptive planning. This
research highlights the urgent need for distribution-level cyber resilience
planning in smart grids.

Abstract: In this paper, we design a safe and efficient cruise control for the

velocity data collected from a chain of human-driven vehicles are
systematically leveraged to design a connected cruise controller that smoothly
responds to traffic perturbations while maximizing energy efficiency. A safety
filter derived from a control barrier function provides the safety guarantee.
We investigate the proposed control design's energy performance against real
traffic datasets and quantify the safety filter's energy impact. It is shown
that optimally utilizing V2V connectivity reduces energy consumption by more

Abstract: This paper presents a novel UAV swarm-based phased array antenna system that
leverages MagSafe- and LEGO-inspired radio frequency (RF) connectors to address
key challenges in distributed phased arrays, including inter-element oscillator
synchronization, localization, phase coherence, and positional accuracy. The
proposed non-threaded, hands-free connectors enable precise inter-element
spacing and establish a continuous, low-loss RF signal propagation path during
mid-flight docking. A multi-stage optimization of the RF connector achieves a
compact form factor, DC-to-RF bandwidth, and a measured insertion loss as low
as 0.2\,dB. The system architecture offers scalability in gain and frequency by
adjusting the array element density per UAV and UAV dimensions. Experimental
results from both stationary and in-flight tests of two UAV-based phased array
prototypes align closely with simulations, demonstrating robust beam steering
to multiple directions. This work delivers a practical, scalable, and
low-complexity platform that enables rapid deployment for next-generation
airborne communications, radar, and remote sensing applications.

Method: 采用两阶段鲁棒优化框架，分别针对RVPP和ESS建模，考虑价格、发电和需求不确定性，并提出ESS容量匹配算法。

Result: 通过模拟不同情景，量化比较了RVPP和ESS的市场表现，提供了具体指导。

Conclusion: 研究为运营商提供了RVPP和ESS在能源市场中的相对价值分析，支持决策优化。

Abstract: This paper compares the participation of Renewable-only Virtual Power Plants
(RVPPs) and grid-scale Electrical Storage Systems (ESSs) in energy and reserve
markets, evaluating their technical performance, market strategies, and
economic outcomes. To ensure a fair comparison, scheduling is analyzed over
representative sample days that capture seasonal operating regimes, and the
associated uncertainties are explicitly modeled. Two-stage robust optimization
frameworks are employed: the RVPP model addresses price, generation, and demand
uncertainties, whereas the ESS model considers price uncertainty only. In
addition, an algorithm is proposed for sizing the ESS so that its market
performance matches that of the RVPP. Simulations cover both favorable and
unfavorable scenarios, reflecting seasonal energy limits for dispatchable
resources, varying forecast errors for nondispatchable resources, and
alternative uncertainty-management strategies. The results provide operators
with quantitative guidance on the relative value of each approach.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) offers a promising framework for
developing control strategies in chemical process systems using historical
data, without the risks or costs of online experimentation. This work
investigates the application of offline RL to the safe and efficient control of
an exothermic polymerisation continuous stirred-tank reactor. We introduce a
Gymnasium-compatible simulation environment that captures the reactor's
nonlinear dynamics, including reaction kinetics, energy balances, and
operational constraints. The environment supports three industrially relevant
scenarios: startup, grade change down, and grade change up. It also includes
reproducible offline datasets generated from proportional-integral controllers
with randomised tunings, providing a benchmark for evaluating offline RL
algorithms in realistic process control tasks.
  We assess behaviour cloning and implicit Q-learning as baseline algorithms,
highlighting the challenges offline agents face, including steady-state offsets
and degraded performance near setpoints. To address these issues, we propose a
novel deployment-time safety layer that performs gradient-based action
correction using input convex neural networks (PICNNs) as learned cost models.
The PICNN enables real-time, differentiable correction of policy actions by
descending a convex, state-conditioned cost surface, without requiring
retraining or environment interaction.
  Experimental results show that offline RL, particularly when combined with
convex action correction, can outperform traditional control approaches and
maintain stability across all scenarios. These findings demonstrate the
feasibility of integrating offline RL with interpretable and safety-aware
corrections for high-stakes chemical process control, and lay the groundwork
for more reliable data-driven automation in industrial systems.

Result: 在接收端噪声可忽略时，算法对时不变和时变信道均能渐近收敛到平均值。

Conclusion: 数值模拟验证了算法的有效性，适用于无线网络中的多智能体系统。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the average consensus problem of multi-agent
systems over wireless networks. We propose a distributed average consensus
algorithm by invoking the concept of over-the-air aggregation, which exploits
the signal superposition property of wireless multiple-access channels. The
proposed algorithm deploys a modified version of the well-known Ratio Consensus
algorithm with an additional normalization step for compensating for the
arbitrary channel coefficients. We show that, when the noise level at the
receivers is negligible, the algorithm converges asymptotically to the average
for time-invariant and time-varying channels. Numerical simulations corroborate
the validity of our results.

Result: 加密DOB-PID控制器在跟踪精度上优于传统加密PID控制器，并成功检测到两种可塑性攻击。

Conclusion: 本研究实现了KHE加密的DOB-PID控制器，提升了不确定条件下的控制性能，并验证了攻击检测能力。

Abstract: This study proposes an encrypted PID control system with a disturbance
observer (DOB) using a keyed-homomorphic encryption (KHE) scheme, aiming to
achieve control performance while providing resistance to malleability-based
attacks. The controller integrates a DOB with a PID structure to compensate for
modeling uncertainties by estimating and canceling external disturbances. To
enhance security, the system is designed to output error symbols when
ciphertexts are falsified during decryption or evaluation, enabling real-time
detection of malleability-based signal or parameter falsification. To validate
the proposed method, we conduct stage positioning control experiments and
attack detection tests using an industrial linear stage. The results show that
the encrypted DOB-based PID controller outperforms a conventional encrypted PID
controller in terms of tracking accuracy. Furthermore, the system successfully
detects two types of malleability-based attacks: one that destabilizes the
control system, and another that degrades its performance. The primary
contributions of this study are: (i) the implementation of a KHE-based
encrypted DOB-PID controller, (ii) the improvement of control performance under
uncertainties, and (iii) the experimental demonstration of attack detection
capabilities in encrypted control systems.

Conclusion: 总结了ZEDs协议设计的关键挑战，并展望了未来研究方向，以推动更高效和可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Zero-energy devices (ZEDs) are key enablers of sustainable Internet of Things
networks by operating solely on harvested ambient energy. Their limited and
dynamic energy budget calls for protocols that are energy-aware and
intelligently adaptive. However, designing effective energy-aware protocols for
ZEDs requires theoretical models that realistically reflect device constraints.
Indeed, existing approaches often oversimplify key aspects such as energy
information (EI) acquisition, task-level variability, and energy storage
dynamics, limiting their practical relevance and transferability. This article
addresses this gap by offering a structured overview of the key modeling
components, trade-offs, and limitations involved in energy-aware ZED protocol
design. For this, we dissect EI acquisition methods and costs, characterize
core operational tasks, analyze energy usage models and storage constraints,
and review representative protocol strategies. Moreover, we offer design
insights and guidelines on how ZED operation protocols can leverage EI, often
illustrated through selected in-house examples. Finally, we outline key
research directions to inspire more efficient and scalable protocol solutions
for future ZEDs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着神经网络在安全关键系统中的广泛应用，确保其无限时间范围的安全性变得至关重要。现有方法基于理想化的实数语义，忽略了有限精度实现中的误差。

Method: 通过将有限精度扰动（感知、执行和计算）纳入安全验证，建模为混合游戏（好恶魔与坏天使对抗），并利用混合精度定点调谐器合成高效实现。

Result: 在汽车和航空领域的案例研究中，生成了具有严格无限时间范围安全保证的高效神经网络实现。

Conclusion: 该方法填补了理论保证与实际实现之间的差距，为NNCSs提供了端到端的安全验证解决方案。

Abstract: As neural networks (NNs) become increasingly prevalent in safety-critical
neural network-controlled cyber-physical systems (NNCSs), formally guaranteeing
their safety becomes crucial. For these systems, safety must be ensured
throughout their entire operation, necessitating infinite-time horizon
verification. To verify the infinite-time horizon safety of NNCSs, recent
approaches leverage Differential Dynamic Logic (dL). However, these dL-based
guarantees rely on idealized, real-valued NN semantics and fail to account for
roundoff errors introduced by finite-precision implementations. This paper
bridges the gap between theoretical guarantees and real-world implementations
by incorporating robustness under finite-precision perturbations -- in sensing,
actuation, and computation -- into the safety verification. We model the
problem as a hybrid game between a good Demon, responsible for control actions,
and a bad Angel, introducing perturbations. This formulation enables formal
proofs of robustness w.r.t. a given (bounded) perturbation. Leveraging this
bound, we employ state-of-the-art mixed-precision fixed-point tuners to
synthesize sound and efficient implementations, thus providing a complete
end-to-end solution. We evaluate our approach on case studies from the
automotive and aeronautics domains, producing efficient NN implementations with
rigorous infinite-time horizon safety guarantees.

Abstract: Brain networks typically exhibit characteristic synchronization patterns
where several synchronized clusters coexist. On the other hand, neurological
disorders are considered to be related to pathological synchronization such as
excessive synchronization of large populations of neurons. Motivated by these
phenomena, this paper presents two approaches to control the cluster
synchronization and the cluster phase cohesiveness of Kuramoto oscillators. One
is based on feeding back the mean phases to the clusters, and the other is
based on the use of pacemakers. First, we show conditions on the feedback gains
and the pacemaker weights for the network to achieve cluster synchronization.
Then, we propose a method to find optimal feedback gains through convex
optimization. Second, we show conditions on the feedback gains and the
pacemaker weights for the network to achieve cluster phase cohesiveness. A
numerical example demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

TL;DR: IntentFlow通过可编辑的界面组件帮助用户动态表达和调整写作意图，提升LLM辅助写作的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户在使用LLM写作时难以清晰表达和调整模糊、动态的意图。

Method: IntentFlow从用户提示中提取目标和意图，提供可编辑的界面组件，支持直接操作或后续提示调整。

Result: 用户能更轻松表达意图，进行更多调整和删除操作，输出更符合动态意图。

Conclusion: 可编辑的意图表示帮助用户提炼和重用意图，提升LLM辅助写作的一致性和可迁移性。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are widely used for writing, users often
struggle to express their nuanced and evolving intents through prompt-based
interfaces. Intents -- low-level strategies or preferences for achieving a
writing goal -- are often vague, fluid, or even subconscious, making it
difficult for users to articulate and adjust them. To address this, we present
IntentFlow, which supports the communication of dynamically evolving intents
throughout LLM-assisted writing. IntentFlow extracts goals and intents from
user prompts and presents them as editable interface components, which users
can revise, remove, or refine via direct manipulation or follow-up prompts.
Visual links connect each component to the output segments it influences,
helping users understand model behavior. In a within-subjects study (N=12),
participants using IntentFlow, compared to a chat-based baseline, expressed
their intents more easily and in detail, engaged in more meaningful actions to
communicate intents, such as adjusting and deleting, and produced outputs that
better aligned with their evolving intents. We found that editable intent
representations help users refine and consolidate a final set of intents, which
can be reused across similar tasks to support consistent and transferable
LLM-assisted writing.

Method: 提出了两种算法：一种提供差分隐私保证（\epsmethod{}），另一种提供细粒度控制身份偏移（\thetamethod{}），通过身份编码生成模型隔离身份特征。

Result: 成功在2D和3D生成架构中生成去标识化的虚拟化身，保护隐私的同时保留了自我感知属性。

Conclusion: 该方法可在公共环境中广泛使用逼真虚拟化身，保持高真实感和沉浸感，同时避免隐私风险。

Abstract: Photorealistic 3D avatar generation has rapidly improved in recent years, and
realistic avatars that match a user's true appearance are more feasible in
Mixed Reality (MR) than ever before. Yet, there are known risks to sharing
one's likeness online, and photorealistic MR avatars could exacerbate these
risks. If user likenesses were to be shared broadly, there are risks for cyber
abuse or targeted fraud based on user appearances. We propose an alternate
avatar rendering scheme for broader social MR -- synthesizing realistic avatars
that preserve a user's demographic identity while being distinct enough from
the individual user to protect facial biometric information. We introduce a
methodology for privatizing appearance by isolating identity within the feature
space of identity-encoding generative models. We develop two algorithms that
then obfuscate identity: \epsmethod{} provides differential privacy guarantees
and \thetamethod{} provides fine-grained control for the level of identity
offset. These methods are shown to successfully generate de-identified virtual
avatars across multiple generative architectures in 2D and 3D. With these
techniques, it is possible to protect user privacy while largely preserving
attributes related to sense of self. Employing these techniques in public
settings could enable the use of photorealistic avatars broadly in MR,
maintaining high realism and immersion without privacy risk.

Conclusion: 未来工具需更好平衡发散与收敛支持，并有效捕捉探索意图。

Abstract: Generative AI opens new possibilities for design exploration by rapidly
generating images aligned with user goals. However, our formative study (N=7)
revealed three key limitations hindering designers' broad and efficient
exploration when interacting with these models. These include difficulty
expressing open-ended exploratory intent, lack of continuity in exploration,
and limited support for reusing or iterating on previous ideas. We propose
IdeaBlocks, where users can express their exploratory intents to generative AI
with structured input and modularize them into Exploration Blocks. These blocks
can be chained for continuous, non-linear exploration and reused across
contexts, enabling broad exploration without losing creative momentum. Our user
study with 12 designers showed that participants using IdeaBlocks explored
112.8% more images with 12.5% greater visual diversity than the baseline. They
also developed ideas in more iterative and continuous patterns, such as
branching, chaining, and revisiting ideas. We discuss design implications for
future tools to better balance divergent and convergent support during
different phases of exploration, and to capture and leverage exploratory
intents more effectively.

Abstract: We introduce DissolvPCB, an electronic prototyping technique for fabricating
fully recyclable printed circuit board assemblies (PCBAs) using affordable FDM
3D printing, with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as a water-soluble substrate and
eutectic gallium-indium (EGaIn) as the conductive material. When obsolete, the
PCBA can be easily recycled by immersing it in water: the PVA dissolves, the
EGaIn re-forms into a liquid metal bead, and the electronic components are
recovered. These materials can then be reused to fabricate a new PCBA.
  We present the DissolvPCB workflow, characterize its design parameters,
evaluate the performance of circuits produced with it, and quantify its
environmental impact through a lifecycle assessment (LCA) comparing it to
conventional CNC-milled FR-4 boards. We further develop a software plugin that
automatically converts PCB design files into 3D-printable circuit substrate
models. To demonstrate the capabilities of DissolvPCB, we fabricate and recycle
three functional prototypes: a Bluetooth speaker featuring a double-sided PCB,
a finger fidget toy with a 3D circuit topology, and a shape-changing gripper
enabled by Joule-heat-driven 4D printing. The paper concludes with a discussion
of current technical limitations and opportunities for future directions.

Result: 参与者通过评估非语言线索的真实性来引导互动，但缺乏系统性知识。

Conclusion: 研究为社交VR平台设计提供了支持偶然互动的实用建议。

Abstract: Opportunistic interactions-the unstructured exchanges that emerge as
individuals become aware of each other's presence-are essential for
relationship building and information sharing in everyday life. Yet, fostering
effective opportunistic interactions has proven challenging, especially at
professional events that have increasingly transitioned from in person to
online formats. In the current paper, we offer an in-depth qualitative account
of how people initiate opportunistic interactions in social VR. Our
participants consisted of 16 individuals with ongoing experience attending
VR-mediated events in their professional communities. We conducted extensive
observations with each participant during one or more events they attended. We
also interviewed them after every observed event, obtaining self-reflections on
their attempts to navigate opportunistic interactions with others. Our analysis
revealed that participants sought to understand the extent to which social VR
preserved the real-world meanings of various nonverbal cues, which we refer to
as verisimilitude. We detailed the unique connections between a person's
perceived verisimilitude and their social behaviors at each of the three steps
toward initiating opportunistic interactions: availability recognition,
attention capture, and ice-breaking. Across these steps, the VR platform
typically replaces complex social mechanisms with feasible technical ones in
order to function, thereby altering the preconditions necessary for a nonverbal
cue's social meanings to remain intact. We identified a rich set of strategies
that participants developed to assess verisimilitude and act upon it, while
also confirming a lack of systematic knowledge guiding their practices. Based
on these findings, we provide actionable insights for social VR platform design
that can best support the initiation of opportunistic interactions for
professional purposes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统在复杂情况下需要驾驶员接管，但接管过程对驾驶员要求高，需研究影响接管表现的关键因素。

Method: 通过驾驶模拟器实验，评估驾驶员的接管表现（响应效率、用户体验、驾驶安全），并使用XGBoost模型分析SA和SC的贡献。

Result: 研究发现，更高的SA能加快响应速度，而SC对接管质量的整体影响更大，两者在性能表现中具有互补作用。

Conclusion: SA和SC在接管表现中发挥不同但互补的作用，为优化人车交互和自动驾驶系统设计提供了重要参考。

Abstract: When automated driving systems encounter complex situations beyond their
operational capabilities, they issue takeover requests, prompting drivers to
resume vehicle control and return to the driving loop as a critical safety
backup. However, this control transition places significant demands on drivers,
requiring them to promptly respond to takeover requests while executing
high-quality interventions. To ensure safe and comfortable control transitions,
it is essential to develop a deep understanding of the key factors influencing
various takeover performance aspects. This study evaluates drivers' takeover
performance across three dimensions: response efficiency, user experience, and
driving safety - using a driving simulator experiment. EXtreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) models are used to investigate the contributions of two
critical factors, i.e., Situational Awareness (SA) and Spare Capacity (SC), in
predicting various takeover performance metrics by comparing the predictive
results to the baseline models that rely solely on basic Driver Characteristics
(DC). The results reveal that (i) higher SA enables drivers to respond to
takeover requests more quickly, particularly for reflexive responses; and (ii)
SC shows a greater overall impact on takeover quality than SA, where higher SC
generally leads to enhanced subjective rating scores and objective execution
trajectories. These findings highlight the distinct yet complementary roles of
SA and SC in shaping performance components, offering valuable insights for
optimizing human-vehicle interactions and enhancing automated driving system
design.

Conclusion: 本文为未来研究提供了框架和方向，强调了自适应时间预算和标准化性能测量的重要性。

Abstract: Conditionally automated driving systems require human drivers to disengage
from non-driving-related activities and resume vehicle control within limited
time budgets when encountering scenarios beyond system capabilities. Ensuring
safe and comfortable transitions is critical for reducing driving risks and
improving user experience. However, takeovers involve complex human-vehicle
interactions, resulting in substantial variability in drivers' responses,
especially in takeover time, defined as the duration needed to regain control.
This variability presents challenges in setting sufficient time budgets that
are neither too short (risking safety and comfort) nor too long (reducing
driver alertness and transition efficiency).
  Although previous research has examined the role of time budgets in
influencing takeover time and performance, few studies have systematically
addressed how to determine sufficient time budgets that adapt to diverse
scenarios and driver needs. This review supports such efforts by examining the
entire takeover sequence, including takeover time, time budget, and takeover
performance. Specifically, we (i) synthesize causal factors influencing
takeover time and propose a taxonomy of its determinants using the
task-capability interface model; (ii) review existing work on fixed and
adaptive time budgets, introducing the concept of the takeover buffer to
describe the gap between takeover time and allocated time budget; (iii) present
a second taxonomy to support standardized and context-sensitive measurement of
takeover performance; (iv) propose a conceptual model describing the
relationships among takeover time, time budget, and performance; and (v)
outline a research agenda with six directions.

Abstract: Generative AI, including large language models (LLMs) have the potential --
and already are being used -- to increase the speed, scale, and types of unsafe
conversations online. LLMs lower the barrier for entry for bad actors to create
unsafe conversations in particular because of their ability to generate
persuasive and human-like text. In our current work, we explore ways to promote
online safety by teaching people about unsafe conversations that can occur
online with and without LLMs. We build on prior work that shows that LLMs can
successfully simulate scam conversations. We also leverage research in the
learning sciences that shows that providing feedback on one's hypothetical
actions can promote learning. In particular, we focus on simulating scam
conversations using LLMs. Our work incorporates two LLMs that converse with
each other to simulate realistic, unsafe conversations that people may
encounter online between a scammer LLM and a target LLM but users of our system
are asked provide feedback to the target LLM.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Con-GaIT是一个面向临床医生的AI辅助步态分析系统，通过透明界面和交互设计实现AI决策的可争议性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前临床仪表板缺乏透明度，无法让医生质疑AI决策，影响了帕金森病护理的效果。

Method: 基于HCI原则，设计了包含视觉解释、角色反馈和可追溯日志的交互模式。

Result: 系统在可争议性评估得分（CAS）中达到0.970，证明其有效性。

Conclusion: 通过人本设计可实现AI决策的可争议性，符合新兴监管标准。

Abstract: AI-assisted gait analysis holds promise for improving Parkinson's Disease
(PD) care, but current clinical dashboards lack transparency and offer no
meaningful way for clinicians to interrogate or contest AI decisions. We
present Con-GaIT (Contestable Gait Interpretation & Tracking), a
clinician-centered system that advances Contestable AI through a tightly
integrated interface designed for interpretability, oversight, and procedural
recourse. Grounded in HCI principles, ConGaIT enables structured disagreement
via a novel Contest & Justify interaction pattern, supported by visual
explanations, role-based feedback, and traceable justification logs. Evaluated
using the Contestability Assessment Score (CAS), the framework achieves a score
of 0.970, demonstrating that contestability can be operationalized through
human-centered design in compliance with emerging regulatory standards. A
demonstration of the framework is available at

TL;DR: 本文探讨了女性主义创客空间如何通过关怀、互助和集体知识生产实现长期可持续性，而非依赖增长或制度化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究女性主义创客空间如何在结构性不稳定的环境中持续存在，填补了CSCW领域对其长期可持续性研究的空白。

Method: 通过对美国8个女性主义创客空间的18位创始人和成员进行访谈，并结合自民族志反思。

Result: 研究发现，可持续性通过关怀驱动的管理、与本地正义运动的团结以及共享治理实现，而非增长或制度化。

Conclusion: 女性主义创客空间通过社会实践成为预演性反空间，展示了如何在日常实践中践行女性主义价值观。

Abstract: Feminist makerspaces offer community led alternatives to dominant tech
cultures by centering care, mutual aid, and collective knowledge production.
While prior CSCW research has explored their inclusive practices, less is known
about how these spaces sustain themselves over time. Drawing on interviews with
18 founders and members across 8 U.S. feminist makerspaces as well as
autoethnographic reflection, we examine the organizational and relational
practices that support long-term endurance. We find that sustainability is not
achieved through growth or institutionalization, but through care-driven
stewardship, solidarity with local justice movements, and shared governance.
These social practices position feminist makerspaces as prefigurative
counterspaces - sites that enact, rather than defer, feminist values in
everyday practice. This paper offers empirical insight into how feminist
makerspaces persist amid structural precarity, and highlights the forms of
labor and coalition-building that underpin alternative sociotechnical
infrastructures.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了在VR中通过手势和语言填充物缓解LLM对话延迟的方法，发现4秒以上延迟会降低体验质量，而自然填充物能改善感知响应时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VR中LLM虚拟代理因延迟导致的对话体验问题。

Method: 使用手势和语言填充物在不同延迟水平和交互场景中评估效果。

Result: 延迟超过4秒会降低体验质量，自然填充物在高延迟条件下显著改善感知响应时间。

Conclusion: 研究为优化延迟对话系统提供了实践和理论支持，并贡献了开源部署工具。

Abstract: We investigated the challenges of mitigating response delays in free-form
conversations with virtual agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs)
within Virtual Reality (VR). For this, we used conversational fillers, such as
gestures and verbal cues, to bridge delays between user input and system
responses and evaluate their effectiveness across various latency levels and
interaction scenarios. We found that latency above 4 seconds degrades quality
of experience, while natural conversational fillers improve perceived response
time, especially in high-delay conditions. Our findings provide insights for
practitioners and researchers to optimize user engagement whenever
conversational systems' responses are delayed by network limitations or slow
hardware. We also contribute an open-source pipeline that streamlines deploying
conversational agents in virtual environments.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于二维模糊集的方法，用于匹配触摸手势，旨在提高用户手绘手势与预存参考手势的匹配容忍度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前手势技术未能充分处理因手指和手部运动自然特性导致的不准确性，影响了人机交互体验。

Method: 采用模糊提示点击点技术，通过二维模糊集匹配用户手势与参考手势。

Result: 该方法能更灵活地处理手势交互中的不准确性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为手势交互提供了一种更灵活且容忍度更高的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a two-dimension fuzzy set based approach for matching
touch-based gestures using fuzzy cued click point technique. The pro posed
approach aims mainly to improve the acceptance of the most closed inac curate
hand drawn gestures generated by the user compared with a predefined referenced
gesture value that is stored in the user profile. Commonly, gestures are used
in order to facilitate the interactive capabilities between humans and
computerized systems. Unfortunately, most of current gesturing techniques don't
deal at the same level of inaccuracy of gesturing, resulted from the nature of
hu man fingers and hands movements. This paper aims, in a more flexible manner,
to tackle the inaccuracy problem existed with gesture-based interactions
between humans and a computerized system.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究分析了针对聋哑用户的用户体验（UX）评估方法，发现现有方法存在局限性，需改进以适应聋哑社区的特殊需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统UX评估方法主要针对听力正常的用户，对聋哑用户的功能性和有效性不足，可能导致评估结果不完整或存在偏见。

Method: 研究分析了一组文献中推荐的针对聋哑用户的UX评估方法，并通过发现和局限性验证其可访问性。

Result: 尽管这些方法在文献中常被推荐用于聋哑用户，但仍存在多种局限性，需改进以适应聋哑社区的特殊沟通技能。

Conclusion: 评估方法需改进以确保对聋哑用户的可访问性，从而准确反映其体验和需求。

Abstract: User Experience (UX) evaluation methods that are commonly used with hearing
users may not be functional or effective for Deaf users. This is because these
methods are primarily designed for users with hearing abilities, which can
create limitations in the interaction, perception, and understanding of the
methods for Deaf individuals. Furthermore, traditional UX evaluation approaches
often fail to address the unique accessibility needs of Deaf users, resulting
in an incomplete or biased assessment of their user experience. This research
focused on analyzing a set of UX evaluation methods recommended for use with
Deaf users, with the aim of validating the accessibility of each method through
findings and limitations. The results indicate that, although these evaluation
methods presented here are commonly recommended in the literature for use with
Deaf users, they present various limitations that must be addressed in order to
better adapt to the communication skills specific to the Deaf community. This
research concludes that evaluation methods must be adapted to ensure accessible
software evaluation for Deaf individuals, enabling the collection of data that
accurately reflects their experiences and needs.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了学生在不同编程背景下使用“vibe coding”平台（Replit）的交互差异，发现高级学生更倾向于包含上下文信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解学生在不同编程课程中如何与“vibe coding”平台互动，以及这种互动如何因编程背景而异。

Method: 通过访谈和“think-aloud”方法，记录学生在Replit上构建网页应用的过程，并进行主题分析。

Result: 大多数学生互动集中在测试和调试，高级学生更倾向于在提示中包含应用功能和代码库上下文。

Conclusion: “vibe coding”平台的使用方式因学生编程背景而异，高级学生更能有效利用上下文信息。

Abstract: Background and Context. Chat-based and inline-coding-based GenAI has already
had substantial impact on the CS Education community. The recent introduction
of ``vibe coding'' may further transform how students program, as it introduces
a new way for students to create software projects with minimal oversight.
  Objectives. The purpose of this study is to understand how students in
introductory programming and advanced software engineering classes interact
with a vibe coding platform (Replit) when creating software and how the
interactions differ by programming background.
  Methods. Interview participants were asked to think-aloud while building a
web application using Replit. Thematic analysis was then used to analyze the
video recordings with an emphasis on the interactions between the student and
Replit.
  Findings. For both groups, the majority of student interactions with Replit
were to test or debug the prototype and only rarely did students visit code.
Prompts by advanced software engineering students were much more likely to
include relevant app feature and codebase contexts than those by introductory
programming students.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多在线编程学习者感到孤立和沮丧，面临信息过载和缺乏指导的问题，而社交媒体上的自我调节实践（如求助、反思）提供了潜在解决方案。

Method: 设计了一个包含网页平台和浏览器扩展的系统，支持学习者通过AI生成反馈构建学习故事，招募15名学习者进行测试。

Result: 用户反馈表明系统作为自我调节工具有效，尤其赞赏实时反思、自动故事反馈和视频注释功能。

Conclusion: 系统展示了AI增强自我调节工具的潜力，未来设计可进一步优化功能以减少摩擦点。

Abstract: Many people learn programming independently from online resources and often
report struggles in achieving their personal learning goals. Learners
frequently describe their experiences as isolating and frustrating, challenged
by abundant uncertainties, information overload, and distraction, compounded by
limited guidance. At the same time, social media serves as a personal space
where many engage in diverse self-regulation practices, including help-seeking,
using external memory aids (e.g., self-notes), self-reflection, emotion
regulation, and self-motivation. For instance, learners often mark achievements
and set milestones through their posts. In response, we developed a system
consisting of a web platform and browser extensions to support self-regulation
online. The design aims to add learner-defined structure to otherwise
unstructured experiences and bring meaning to curation and reflection
activities by translating them into learning stories with AI-generated
feedback. We position storytelling as an integrative approach to design that
connects resource curation, reflective and sensemaking practice, and narrative
practices learners already use across social platforms. We recruited 15
informal programming learners who are regular social media users to engage with
the system in a self-paced manner; participation concluded upon submitting a
learning story and survey. We used three quantitative scales and a qualitative
survey to examine users' characteristics and perceptions of the system's
support for their self-regulation. User feedback suggests the system's
viability as a self-regulation aid. Learners particularly valued in-situ
reflection, automated story feedback, and video annotation, while other
features received mixed views. We highlight perceived benefits, friction
points, and design opportunities for future AI-augmented self-regulation tools.

TL;DR: VRISE是一种沉浸式虚拟现实实验室，旨在通过交互式模块改善测量教育的灵活性和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统测量教育存在后勤和认知挑战，阻碍了学生的可及性和参与度。

Method: 开发VRISE，提供地面和空中测量任务的交互式体验，包括数字水平仪和无人机导航。

Result: 用户测试显示测量准确性、任务效率和交互质量均有提升，技能发展明显。

Conclusion: VRISE通过降低认知负荷和身体需求，展示了沉浸式数字环境在测量教育中的潜力。

Abstract: Surveying is a core component of civil engineering education, requiring
students to engage in hands-on spatial measurement, instrumentation handling,
and field-based decision-making. However, traditional instruction often poses
logistical and cognitive challenges that can hinder accessibility and student
engagement. While virtual laboratories have gained traction in engineering
education, few are purposefully designed to support flexible, adaptive learning
in surveying. To address this gap, we developed Virtual Reality for Immersive
and Interactive Surveying Education (VRISE), an immersive virtual reality
laboratory that replicates ground-based and aerial surveying tasks through
customizable, accessible, and user-friendly modules. VRISE features interactive
experiences such as differential leveling with a digital level equipment and
waypoint-based drone navigation, enhanced by input smoothing, adaptive
interfaces, and real-time feedback to accommodate diverse learning styles.
Evaluation across multiple user sessions demonstrated consistent gains in
measurement accuracy, task efficiency, and interaction quality, with a clear
progression in skill development across the ground-based and aerial surveying
modalities. By reducing cognitive load and physical demands, even in tasks
requiring fine motor control and spatial reasoning, VRISE demonstrates the
potential of immersive, repeatable digital environments to enhance surveying
education, broaden participation, and strengthen core competencies in a safe
and engaging setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管信息技术发展迅速，但某些领域（如非营利组织）仍未充分应用这些技术。PWA作为一种新兴技术，旨在打破传统应用开发的限制。

Method: 设计了一个支持叙事疗法的PWA，并通过实际案例验证其优势。

Result: PWA能够通过网页访问并安装为应用，为叙事疗法工作坊提供了软件支持。

Conclusion: PWA在心理健康领域的应用展示了其潜力，尤其是在非营利组织中的推广价值。

Abstract: In spite of all advances promoted by information technologies, there are
still activities where this technology is not applied for reasons such as being
carried out in non-profit organizations or because they have not adapted to
this modernization. Until recently, the way to work with mobile devices was
either by connecting through a web page with the device's browser, or by
downloading an application from the corresponding platform. But lately,
technologies are being developed that aim to break with this, as in the case of
Progressive Web Applications (PWA). One of the advantages offered by PWA is to
access the web page and install it as an application on the device. The purpose
of this article is to design a progressive Web application for the support of
Storytelling Therapy, one of the novel therapies applied in the field of mental
health. In addition to providing a software application to enhance Storytelling
Therapy workshops, it is also intended to analyze and verify the advantages of
PWA in a real case.
