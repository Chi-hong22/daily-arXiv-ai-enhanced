Second-order pruning methods, such as Optimal Brain\nDamage (OBD) and its variants, including Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) and the\nrecent SparseGPT, compress networks in a single pass by leveraging the local\nHessian, achieving far higher sparsity than magnitude thresholding. Despite\ntheir success in vision and language, the consequences of such weight removal\non closed-loop stability, tracking accuracy, and safety have remained unclear.\nWe present the first mathematically rigorous robustness analysis of\nsecond-order pruning in nonlinear discrete-time control. The system evolves\nunder a continuous transition map, while the controller is an $L$-layer\nmultilayer perceptron with ReLU-type activations that are globally 1-Lipschitz.\nPruning the weight matrix of layer $k$ replaces $W_k$ with $W_k+\\delta W_k$,\nproducing the perturbed parameter vector $\\widehat{\\Theta}=\\Theta+\\delta\\Theta$\nand the pruned policy $\\pi(\\cdot;\\widehat{\\Theta})$. For every input state\n$s\\in X$ we derive the closed-form inequality $\n\\|\\pi(s;\\Theta)-\\pi(s;\\widehat{\\Theta})\\|_2 \\le C_k(s)\\,\\|\\delta W_k\\|_2, $\nwhere the constant $C_k(s)$ depends only on unpruned spectral norms and biases,\nand can be evaluated in closed form from a single forward pass. The derived\nbounds specify, prior to field deployment, the maximal admissible pruning\nmagnitude compatible with a prescribed control-error threshold.

However, for most sellers, the majority of\ntheir sales come from organic traffic. Consequently, the relationship between\ntheir ad spending and total sales remains uncertain, resulting in operational\ninefficiency. To address this issue, e-commerce platforms have recently\nintroduced a novel platform-wide marketing service known as QuanZhanTui, which\nhas reportedly enhanced marketing efficiency for sellers and driven substantial\nrevenue growth for platforms. QuanZhanTui allows sellers to bid for impressions\nfrom the platform's entire traffic to boost their total sales without\ncompromising the platform's user experience. In this paper, we investigate the\nmechanism design problem that arises from QuanZhanTui. The problem is\nformulated as a multi-objective optimization to balance sellers' welfare and\nplatform's user experience. We first introduce the stock-constrained value\nmaximizer model, which reflects sellers' dual requirements on marketing\nefficiency and platform-wide ROI. Then, we propose the Liquid Payment Auction\n(LPA), an auction designed to optimize the balanced objectives while accounting\nfor sellers' requirements in the auto-bidding environment.

The empirical evidence\ndemonstrates how interfaces function as sites of epistemological collision,\ncreating methodological pressure zones where traditional disciplinary\napproaches prove insufficient for analysing the complex socio-technical\nphenomena at the interface.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86AI\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u6587\u5316\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u754c\u9762\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4ea4\u53c9\u70b9\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u65b0\u5b66\u79d1\u6587\u5316\u3002\u901a\u8fc7IMCS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u5de5\u7a0b\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u3001\u6279\u5224\u6027\u6280\u672f\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u78b0\u649e\u5982\u4f55\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u5b66\u79d1\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u63ed\u793aAI\u754c\u9762\u5982\u4f55\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8fb9\u754c\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u65b9\u6cd5\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u7b80\u5355\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u6311\u6218\u4f20\u7edf\u5b66\u79d1\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528IMCS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u6790\u548c\u516c\u5171\u3001\u533b\u7597\u53ca\u6559\u80b2\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u8ba4\u77e5\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\u5411\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u56db\u79cd\u6f0f\u6d1e\u5411\u91cf\uff08\u53cd\u5c04\u6a21\u62df\u3001\u6743\u5a01\u8c03\u8282\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u8377\u5229\u7528\u548c\u5e02\u573a-\u5b89\u5168\u5f20\u529b\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u754c\u9762\u662f\u77e5\u8bc6\u78b0\u649e\u7684\u573a\u6240\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5b66\u79d1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u5206\u6790\u590d\u6742\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u6280\u672f\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u6307\u51fa\u754c\u9762\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u6587\u5316\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u573a\u6240\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u5b66\u79d1\u8fb9\u754c\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u5206\u79bb\u548c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6574\u5408\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u6587\u5316\u673a\u5236\u5728\u5b66\u79d1\u878d\u5408\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Their high agility and unpredictable\nmotion make drones difficult to track and intercept. While existing methods\nfocus on detecting current positions, many counter-drone strategies rely on\nforecasting future trajectories and thus require more than reactive detection\nto be effective. To address this critical gap, we propose an unsupervised\nvision-based method for predicting the three-dimensional trajectories of\ndrones. Our approach first uses an unsupervised technique to extract drone\ntrajectories from raw LiDAR point clouds, then aligns these trajectories with\ncamera images through motion consistency to generate reliable pseudo-labels. We\nthen combine kinematic estimation with a visual Mamba neural network in a\nself-supervised manner to predict future drone trajectories. We evaluate our\nmethod on the challenging MMAUD dataset, including the V2 sequences that\nfeature wide-field-of-view multimodal sensors and dynamic UAV motion in urban\nscenes.

Moreover, we discovered a gender-dominant axis in the created\nspeaker space, indicating the potential to control speaker attributes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eDNN\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u97f3\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u5b9a\u4e49\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u91c7\u6837\u53c2\u6570\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u8bed\u97f3\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u8981\u5b9a\u4e49\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982HMM\uff09\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u4fc3\u4f7f\u63a2\u7d22DNN\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5728DNN\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b9a\u4e49\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u91c7\u6837\u53c2\u6570\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u8bed\u97f3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u8bed\u97f3\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u6027\u522b\u4e3b\u5bfc\u8f74\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u53ef\u63a7\u5236\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u5728\u8bed\u97f3\u5408\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Generative modeling of such data requires jointly capturing\nintra- and inter-channel structure, while also generalizing across arbitrary\ncombinations of observed and missing channels for practical application.\nExisting diffusion-based models generally assume low-dimensional inputs (e.g.,\nRGB images) and rely on simple conditioning mechanisms that break spatial\ncorrespondence and ignore inter-channel dependencies. This work proposes a\nunified diffusion framework for controllable generation over structured and\nspatial biological data.

Among its numerous applications, image rendering is crucial.\nNevertheless, rendering methodologies like 3D Gaussian Splatting impose high\ncomputational demands, driven predominantly by user expectations for superior\nvisual quality. This results in notable processing delays for real-time image\nrendering, which greatly affects the user experience. Additionally, VR devices\nsuch as head-mounted displays (HMDs) are intricately linked to human visual\nbehavior, leveraging knowledge from perception and cognition to improve user\nexperience.

One recent\ntrend is the emergence of large grid-connected batteries, that can be\ncontrolled to provide multiple storage and flexibility services, using a\nstacked revenue model. Another emerging development is renewable energy\ncommunities (REC), in which prosumers invest in their own renewable generation\ncapacity, but also requiring battery storage for flexibility. In this paper, we\nstudy settings in which energy communities rent battery capacity from a battery\noperator through a battery-as-a-service (BaaS) model. We present a methodology\nfor determining the sizing and pricing of battery capacity that can be rented,\nsuch that it provides economic benefits to both the community and the battery\noperator that participates in the energy market. We examine how sizes and\nprices vary across a number of different scenarios for different types of\ntariffs (flat, dynamic) and competing energy market uses. Second, we conduct a\nsystematic study of linear optimization models for battery control when\ndeployed to provide flexibility to energy communities. We show that existing\napproaches for battery control with daily time windows have a number of\nimportant limitations in practical deployments, and we propose a number of\nregularization functions in the optimization to address them. Finally, we\ninvestigate the proposed method using real generation, demand, tariffs, and\nbattery data, based on a practical case study from a large battery operator in\nthe Netherlands.

This capability is essential in a variety of applications,\nincluding security systems, acoustic monitoring, and speaker tracking, where\naccurately identifying the direction of a sound source enables real-time\nresponses, efficient resource allocation, and improved situational awareness.\nWhile sound-tracking is closely related to localization, it specifically\nfocuses on identifying the direction of the sound source rather than estimating\nits exact position in space. Despite its utility, sound-tracking systems face\nseveral challenges, such as maintaining directional accuracy and precision,\nalong with the need for sophisticated hardware configurations and complex\nsignal processing algorithms. This paper presents a sound-tracking method using\nthree electret microphones. We estimate the direction of a sound source using a\nlightweight method that analyzes signals from three strategically placed\nmicrophones. By comparing the average power of the received signals, the system\ninfers the most probable direction of the sound. The results indicate that the\npower level from each microphone effectively determines the sound source\ndirection. Our system employs a straightforward and cost-effective hardware\ndesign, ensuring simplicity and affordability in implementation. It achieves a\nlocalization error of less than 6 degrees and a precision of 98%. Additionally,\nits effortless integration with various systems makes it versatile and\nadaptable.

Here, we\nestablish that fairness -- in terms of a relaxation of envy-freeness -- and\nPareto efficiency can always be achieved together. Specifically, our fairness\nguarantees are in terms of envy-freeness up to $k$ reallocations (EFR-$k$): An\nallocation $A$ of the indivisible items is said to be EFR-$k$ if there exists a\nsubset $R$ of at most $k$ items such that, for each agent $i$, we can reassign\nitems from within $R$ (in $A$) and obtain an allocation, $A^i$, which is\nenvy-free for $i$. We establish that, when allocating mixed manna among $n$\nagents with additive valuations, an EFR-$(n-1)$ and Pareto optimal (PO)\nallocation $A$ always exists. Further, the individual envy-free allocations\n$A^i$, induced by reassignments, are also PO. In addition, we prove that such\nfair and efficient allocations are efficiently computable when the number of\nagents, $n$, is fixed.\n  We also obtain positive results focusing on EFR by itself (and without the PO\ndesideratum).

Here, the $(n-1)$ bound is tight for chores and\n$\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$ is tight for goods.\n  Our results advance the understanding of fair and efficient allocation of\nindivisible mixed manna and rely on a novel application of the\nKnaster-Kuratowski-Mazurkiewicz (KKM) Theorem in discrete fair division.

Experimental vali-dation on a multi-stage DC-DC converter\ndemonstrates that NSS achieves 23x speedup and 60% hardware resource reduction\ncompared to traditional solvers, paving the way for deploying edge inference of\nhigh-fidelity PES dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff08NSS\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u65ad\u7535\u529b\u7535\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u8fde\u7eed-\u79bb\u6563\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u65f6\u8fb9\u7f18\u4fa7\u63a8\u65ad\u7535\u529b\u7535\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5177\u6709\u53d8\u9769\u6027\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "NSS\u5229\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u4e2d\u8017\u65f6\u7684\u77e9\u9635\u8fd0\u7b97\u548c\u9ad8\u9636\u6570\u503c\u79ef\u5206\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5c06\u987a\u5e8f\u74f6\u9888\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9002\u5408\u8fb9\u7f18\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0cNSS\u5728\u591a\u7ea7DC-DC\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8623\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u548c60%\u786c\u4ef6\u8d44\u6e90\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "NSS\u4e3a\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7535\u529b\u7535\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u63a8\u65ad\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

While recent\nmethods report strong in-domain performance, their real-world utility remains\nunclear. In this analysis, we critically examine the limitations of current\nevaluation practices, particularly the widespread use of Equal Error Rate\n(EER), which often obscures generalization and deployment readiness. We propose\nreframing the localization task as a sequential anomaly detection problem and\nadvocate for the use of threshold-dependent metrics such as accuracy,\nprecision, recall, and F1-score, which better reflect real-world behavior.\nSpecifically, we analyze the performance of the open-source Coarse-to-Fine\nProposal Refinement Framework (CFPRF), which achieves a 20-ms EER of 7.61% on\nthe in-domain PartialSpoof evaluation set, but 43.25% and 27.59% on the\nLlamaPartialSpoof and Half-Truth out-of-domain test sets. Interestingly, our\nreproduced version of the same model performs worse on in-domain data (9.84%)\nbut better on the out-of-domain sets (41.72% and 14.98%, respectively). This\nhighlights the risks of over-optimizing for in-domain EER, which can lead to\nmodels that perform poorly in real-world scenarios. It also suggests that while\ndeep learning models can be effective on in-domain data, they generalize poorly\nto out-of-domain scenarios, failing to detect novel synthetic samples and\nmisclassifying unfamiliar bona fide audio.

Instead, each buyer reports and commits to a bid\ndistribution in the ex-ante stage, which the auctioneer uses as input to the\nmechanism. Buyers strategically decide the reported distributions to maximize\nex-ante utility, potentially deviating from their value distributions.

We\nstudy the design of ex-ante incentive compatible mechanisms, and aim to\nmaximize revenue in a prior-independent approximation framework. We introduce a\nfamily of threshold-augmented mechanisms, which ensures ex-ante incentive\ncompatibility while boosting revenue through ex-ante thresholds. Based on these\nmechanisms, we construct the Peer-Max Mechanism, which achieves an either-or\napproximation guarantee for general non-identical distributions. Specifically,\nfor any value distributions, its expected revenue either achieves a constant\nfraction of the optimal social welfare, or surpasses the second-price revenue\nby a constant fraction, where the constants depend on the number of buyers and\na tunable parameter. We also provide an upper bound on the revenue achievable\nby any ex-ante incentive compatible mechanism, matching our lower bound up to a\nconstant factor.

However, this binary approach\nconflates token/operation redundancy - critical operations may be removed along\nwith discarded tokens, while preserved tokens retain all potentially redundant\noperations. To surgically eliminate redundant operations while preserving\ncritical ones, we propose Greedily Sorted Operation Pruning (GSOP), a\ndata-driven method that directly prunes operations rather than tokens. GSOP\nfirst decomposes a VLM decoder's computations into atomic operations along\nthree dimensions: token groups, layer positions, and computation modules. GSOP\ndetermines the pruning order of operations through greedy sorting: GSOP\niteratively selects the redundant operation that incurs minimal performance\ndrop considering previously pruned operations. Different computational budgets\ncan be accommodated without re-searching by simply pruning operations according\nto this order until the desired budget is met. GSOP enhances sorting efficiency\nthrough: a) leveraging historical operation rankings to avoid redundant\nevaluations; b) excluding the ``free-to-prune\" and ``danger-to-prune\"\noperations from sorting. GSOP achieves compelling efficiency-performance\ntradeoffs, reducing computation by 70% with only 4% performance loss while\nmaintaining up to 18% higher performance than state-of-the-art methods when\ntransferred across diverse VLMs and tasks.

Addressing this gap, our team\ndesigned an innovative mobile game aimed at bolstering medication adherence and\ninformation retention within the general population. Employing Amazon\nMechanical Turk, participants were enlisted and allocated into two cohorts: one\nengaged with our mobile game and the other perused an informational pamphlet\nabout medication. Both cohorts underwent a pre-intervention quiz, followed by\ntheir respective interventions, and concluded with a post-intervention quiz.\nPrimary outcome measures included the difference in quiz scores and the game\nplay duration. The investigation encompassed 243 participants with homogenous\nbaseline attributes. Participants interacting with the mobile game depicted a\nsignificant enhancement in their post-intervention scores compared to the\npre-intervention scores. We observed a notable correlation of 0.346 (p<0.001)\nwith a robust medium effect size of 0.641 (0.503 - 0.779). Although the\nduration of game play and post-intervention scores didn't exhibit a direct\ncorrelation, a tendency towards superior post-intervention scores was evident\namong participants who dedicated more time to the game. The interactive mobile\ngame we developed exhibits potential as an engaging instrument for empowering\npatients and caregivers.

DER aggregators, entities that coordinate and optimize the actions\nof many small-scale DERs, play a key role in this transformation. This paper\npresents a hybrid Mean-Field Control (MFC) and Mean-Field Game (MFG) framework\nfor integrating DER aggregators into wholesale electricity markets. Unlike\ntraditional approaches that treat market prices as exogenous, our model\ncaptures the feedback between aggregators' strategies and locational marginal\nprices (LMPs) of electricity. The MFC component optimizes DER operations within\neach aggregator, while the MFG models strategic interactions among multiple\naggregators. To account for various uncertainties, we incorporate reinforcement\nlearning (RL), which allows aggregators to learn optimal bidding strategies in\ndynamic market conditions. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a\nmean-field equilibrium and validate the framework through a case study of the\nOahu Island power system.

A key challenge in CRL is to identify tasks that promote\nexploration, yet are similar enough to support effective transfer. While recent\napproach suggests comparing tasks via their Structural Causal Models (SCMs),\nthe method requires access to ground-truth causal structures, an unrealistic\nassumption in most RL settings. In this work, we propose Causal-Paced Deep\nReinforcement Learning (CP-DRL), a curriculum learning framework aware of SCM\ndifferences between tasks based on interaction data approximation.

However, they continue to struggle with long-form\nvideos because of an inefficient perception of temporal intervals. Unlike\nhumans, who can dynamically adjust their temporal focus to locate\nquery-relevant moments, current MLLMs often rely on dense, uniform sampling\nacross the video timeline, leading to high memory consumption and a risk of\nmissing crucial information. To address this challenge, we introduce Temporal\nSearch, a training-free framework that enables MLLMs to explore temporal\nregions for improved long video understanding iteratively. TS is based on a key\nobservation: the model's generation confidence across different temporal\nintervals is highly correlated with prediction accuracy. TS operates through\ntwo main iterative stages. First, the MLLM proposes a temporal interval that is\nlikely to contain task-relevant information. Then, it samples a fixed number of\nframes from the interval, regardless of length, and feeds them into the model\nto produce a refined response and confidence score. TS refines the focus of the\nmodel by iteratively shifting attention to more fine-grained temporal\nintervals, improving its understanding of long videos. Additionally,\nkeyframe-level descriptions are collected to facilitate cross-interval\nperception throughout the video.

In this\nwork, we aim to explore whether it is possible to enhance the motion risk\nprediction capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLM) by synthesizing\nhigh-risk motion data. Specifically, we introduce a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) based\nmotion simulation method to model risks from three aspects: the ego-vehicle,\nother vehicles, and the environment. This allows us to synthesize\nplug-and-play, high-risk motion data suitable for VLM training, which we call\nDriveMRP-10K. Furthermore, we design a VLM-agnostic motion risk estimation\nframework, named DriveMRP-Agent. This framework incorporates a novel\ninformation injection strategy for global context, ego-vehicle perspective, and\ntrajectory projection, enabling VLMs to effectively reason about the spatial\nrelationships between motion waypoints and the environment.

In this work, we draw inspiration from adaptive and\nstructured dynamics observed in biological neural systems and introduce the\nAdaptive Unitary State Space Model (AUSSM)- a novel class of SSMs that\nleverages skew-symmetric, input-dependent recurrence to achieve unitary\nevolution and high expressive power. Using algebraic automata theory, we prove\nthat AUSSM can perform modulo counting and simulate solvable group automata at\nfinite precision, enabling SSMs to model a broad class of regular languages\nthat are out of reach for other SSM architectures. To overcome the practical\ninefficiencies of adaptive recurrence, we develop a separable convolution\nformulation and a CUDA implementation that enables scalable parallel training.\nEmpirically, we show that AUSSM when interleaved with Mamba outperform prior\nSSMs on formal algorithmic tasks such as parity and modular arithmetic, and\nachieve competent performance on real-world long time-series classification\nbenchmarks.

This scarcity hinders generalization to\nreal-world scenarios. To address this, most existing methods finetune\nfoundation image generative models to exploit their learned visual priors.\nHowever, these approaches typically generate only multi-view images and rely on\npost-processing to produce UV texture maps -- an essential representation in\nmodern graphics pipelines. Such two-stage pipelines often suffer from error\naccumulation and spatial inconsistencies across the 3D surface. In this paper,\nwe introduce SeqTex, a novel end-to-end framework that leverages the visual\nknowledge encoded in pretrained video foundation models to directly generate\ncomplete UV texture maps. Unlike previous methods that model the distribution\nof UV textures in isolation, SeqTex reformulates the task as a sequence\ngeneration problem, enabling the model to learn the joint distribution of\nmulti-view renderings and UV textures. This design effectively transfers the\nconsistent image-space priors from video foundation models into the UV domain.\nTo further enhance performance, we propose several architectural innovations: a\ndecoupled multi-view and UV branch design, geometry-informed attention to guide\ncross-domain feature alignment, and adaptive token resolution to preserve fine\ntexture details while maintaining computational efficiency. Together, these\ncomponents allow SeqTex to fully utilize pretrained video priors and synthesize\nhigh-fidelity UV texture maps without the need for post-processing.

The main contributions include i) the robust characterization of DDUs\nwith a dependency decomposition structure; ii) a generic DDU coping mechanism,\nmanifested as the bilateral matching between uncertainty and flexibility; iii)\nanalyses of the influence of DDU incorporation on the convexity/non-convexity\nof robust dispatch problems; and iv) generic solution algorithms adaptive for\nDDUs. Under this framework, the inherent distinctions and correlations between\nDDUs and DIUs are revealed, providing a fundamental theoretical basis for the\neconomic and reliable operation of RES-dominated power systems. Applications in\nthe source and demand sides illustrate the importance of considering DDUs and\nverify the effectiveness of proposed algorithms for robust dispatch with DDUs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5177\u6709\u51b3\u7b56\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff08DDUs\uff09\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u62ecDDUs\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u8868\u5f81\u3001\u901a\u7528\u5e94\u5bf9\u673a\u5236\u3001\u5bf9\u95ee\u9898\u51f8\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5206\u6790\u4ee5\u53ca\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\uff08RES\uff09\u548c\u9700\u6c42\u54cd\u5e94\uff08DR\uff09\u7684\u4e0d\u65ad\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u9700\u6c42\u63d0\u5347\uff0cDDUs\u5bf9\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8c03\u5ea6\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ecDDUs\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5206\u89e3\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u7684\u53cc\u8fb9\u5339\u914d\u673a\u5236\u3001\u95ee\u9898\u51f8\u6027\u5206\u6790\u4ee5\u53ca\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86DDUs\u4e0eDIUs\u7684\u5185\u5728\u533a\u522b\u4e0e\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728RES\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8003\u8651DDUs\u5bf9\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53ef\u9760\u8fd0\u884c\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3aRES\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Applied to\nvLLMs, CSAT exploits the inherent compressibility of both visual and textual\nrepresentations especially evident in video, where temporal redundancy is high,\nand in language, where cross-modal grounding is often sparse.

Our multimodal model demonstrates\nsuperior navigation capabilities in most scenarios, but faces challenges in\ndynamic environments, likely due to limited diversity in the demonstrations.\nNevertheless, the ability to learn directly from data and generalise across\nlayouts suggests that IL can be a practical navigation approach, and\npotentially a useful initialisation strategy for subsequent lifelong learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\uff08IL\uff09\u5728\u5ba4\u5185\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u5bb6\u6f14\u793a\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u79cd\u5bfc\u822a\u7b56\u7565\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aIL\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5ba4\u5185\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u6216\u9700\u8981\u624b\u52a8\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u800c\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e13\u5bb6\uff08\u64cd\u7eb5\u6746\uff09\u6f14\u793a\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u4e8eRGB\u56fe\u50cf\u3001LiDAR\u53ca\u5176\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u7b56\u7565\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u52bf\u573a\u5bfc\u822a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u56e0\u6f14\u793a\u6570\u636e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u800c\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "IL\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u5e03\u5c40\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ec8\u8eab\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

To also capture\nsideswipe collisions, a two-dimensional extension, TTC$_{\\text{2D}}$, was\nintroduced. However, this formulation assumes both vehicles have the same\nheading and that their headings remain unchanged during the manoeuvre, in\naddition to the standard assumptions on the prediction horizon. Moreover, its\nuse for articulated vehicles like a tractor-semitrailer remains unclear. This\npaper addresses these limitations by developing three enhanced versions of\nTTC$_{\\text{2D}}$. The first incorporates vehicle heading information, which is\nmissing in the original formulation. The standard assumption of constant speed\nand heading in the prediction horizon holds. The second adapts this to\narticulated vehicles while retaining the assumptions of the first version. The\nthird version maintains the constant heading assumption but relaxes the\nconstant speed assumption by allowing constant acceleration. The versions are\ntested in a cut-in scenario using the CARLA simulation environment.

For a given network and a given choice\nof the input and output nodes, the H2-norm provides a natural and general\nquantification of the extent to which input signals-whether deterministic or\nstochastic, periodic or arbitrary-are amplified. We analyze a diverse set of\nempirical networks and conjecture that many naturally occurring systems-such as\nfood webs, signaling pathways, and gene regulatory circuits-are structurally\norganized to enhance the passing of signals, facilitating the efficient flow of\nbiomass, information, or regulatory activity. This passing behavior culminates\nin directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), for which we analytically show that\namplification depends on the number and length of input-output pathways, which\nis consistent with the well-known tendency of naturally emerging networks to\napproximate DAG structures. In contrast, the structure of engineered systems\nlike power grids appears to be intentionally designed to suppress signal\npropagation, as the transmitted quantity-voltage phase differences-requires\ntight control to maintain synchronized operation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u53ca\u5176\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u5f71\u54cd\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u9012\u6548\u7387\uff0cH2\u8303\u6570\u91cf\u5316\u4fe1\u53f7\u653e\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u81ea\u7136\u7cfb\u7edf\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u9012\uff0c\u800c\u5de5\u7a0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5219\u6291\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u9012\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u81ea\u7136\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u5de5\u7a0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u9012\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528H2\u8303\u6570\u91cf\u5316\u4fe1\u53f7\u653e\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u591a\u79cd\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u98df\u7269\u7f51\u3001\u4fe1\u53f7\u901a\u8def\u548c\u57fa\u56e0\u8c03\u63a7\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "\u81ea\u7136\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982\u98df\u7269\u7f51\uff09\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u9012\uff0c\u800c\u5de5\u7a0b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982\u7535\u7f51\uff09\u5219\u6291\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u76ee\u6807\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u9012\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u81ea\u7136\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u9012\uff0c\u5de5\u7a0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5219\u6ce8\u91cd\u4fe1\u53f7\u63a7\u5236\u3002"}}

There is an increasing effort to\nendow Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with similar spatial reasoning\ncapabilities.

To address this question, we propose a\nnew evaluation framework aimed at assessing the performance of VLMs in spatial\ndeformation reasoning tasks.

Leveraging our data engine, we can\ngenerate unlimited evaluation problem pairs with infinite steps, without any\ndata leakage. We explore whether the model can effectively perform spatial\ndeformation reasoning from two directions: forward reasoning (given the\noperations, find the final state) and reverse reasoning (given the final state,\ndetermine the operations). We adopt a ladder competition format, using the\nnumber of deformation steps as the level classification criterion, with the\ngoal of exploring the boundaries of the model's deformation reasoning\ncapabilities.

Current approaches, however, suffer from\nspatial hallucination and struggle with balancing semantic fidelity and\nphysical plausibility, often producing layouts with deficits such as floating\nor overlapping objects and misaligned stacking relation. In this paper, we\npropose AutoLayout, a fully automated method that integrates a closed-loop\nself-validation process within a dual-system framework. Specifically, a slow\nsystem harnesses detailed reasoning with a Reasoning-Reflection-Generation\n(RRG) pipeline to extract object attributes and spatial constraints. Then, a\nfast system generates discrete coordinate sets and a topological relation set\nthat are jointly validated. To mitigate the limitations of handcrafted rules,\nwe further introduce an LLM-based Adaptive Relation Library (ARL) for\ngenerating and evaluating layouts. Through the implementation of Slow-Fast\nCollaborative Reasoning, the AutoLayout efficiently generates layouts after\nthorough deliberation, effectively mitigating spatial hallucination. Its\nself-validation mechanism establishes a closed-loop process that iteratively\ncorrects potential errors, achieving a balance between physical stability and\nsemantic consistency.

Recent\nadvancements have introduced different lidar types, including cost-effective\nsolid-state lidars such as the Livox Avia and Mid-360. The Mid-360, with its\ndome-like design, is increasingly used in portable mapping and unmanned aerial\nvehicle (UAV) applications due to its low cost, compact size, and reliable\nperformance. However, the lack of datasets that include dome-shaped lidars,\nsuch as the Mid-360, alongside other solid-state and spinning lidars\nsignificantly hinders the comparative evaluation of novel approaches across\nplatforms. Additionally, performance differences between low-cost solid-state\nand high-end spinning lidars (e.g., Ouster OS series) remain insufficiently\nexamined, particularly without an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) in odometry.\n  To address this gap, we introduce a novel dataset comprising data from\nmultiple lidar types, including the low-cost Livox Avia and the dome-shaped\nMid-360, as well as high-end spinning lidars such as the Ouster series.\nNotably, to the best of our knowledge, no existing dataset comprehensively\nincludes dome-shaped lidars such as Mid-360 alongside both other solid-state\nand spinning lidars.

The optimizer prioritizes reliability by enforcing power\navailability as a hard constraint and penalizing battery thermal derating.\nWithin these bounds, the controller performs a Pareto sweep on the relative\nweights of inverter and battery losses to balance the trade-off between\ninverter efficiency and battery efficiency. The inverter loss model is based on\nan empirical lookup table (LUT) derived from a commercial inverter system,\nwhile the battery thermal loss model uses SOC and temperature-dependent\ninternal resistance, with electric current computed from the battery Equivalent\nCircuit Model (ECM). When the optimization was applied to a two-string BESS,\nthe competing effects of inverter and battery losses on system availability and\nthermal derating were observed. The balanced operation yielded improvements of\n1% in battery efficiency, 1.5% in inverter efficiency, and 2% in derating\nefficiency, while maintaining higher availability.

We evaluate\nfour scenarios for an energy arbitrage scenario, that vary in model precision\nand treatment of aging costs. Key performance metrics include operational\nrevenue, power schedule mismatch, missed revenues, capacity losses, and revenue\ngenerated per unit of capacity loss. Our analysis reveals that ignoring\nheterogeneity of subunits may lead to infeasible dispatch plans and reduced\nrevenues. In contrast, combining accurate representation of degraded subsystems\nand the consideration of aging costs in the objective function improves\noperational accuracy and economic efficiency of BESS with heterogeneous aged\nsubunits. The fully informed scenario, which combines aging-cost-aware\noptimization with precise string-level modeling, achieves 21% higher revenue\nper unit of SOH loss compared to the baseline scenario.

While\ncomputational phenotyping algorithms show promise for automating rare disease\ndetection, their development is hindered by the scarcity of labeled data and\nbiases in existing label sources. Gold-standard labels from registries and\nexpert chart reviews are highly accurate but constrained by selection bias and\nthe cost of manual review. In contrast, labels derived from electronic health\nrecords (EHRs) cover a broader range of patients but can introduce substantial\nnoise. To address these challenges, we propose a weakly supervised,\ntransformer-based framework that combines a small set of gold-standard labels\nwith a large volume of iteratively updated silver-standard labels derived from\nEHR data. This hybrid approach enables the training of a highly accurate and\ngeneralizable phenotyping model that scales rare disease detection beyond the\nscope of individual clinical expertise. Our method is initialized by learning\nembeddings of medical concepts based on their semantic meaning or co-occurrence\npatterns in EHRs, which are then refined and aggregated into patient-level\nrepresentations via a multi-layer transformer architecture. Using two rare\npulmonary diseases as a case study, we validate our model on EHR data from\nBoston Children's Hospital. Our framework demonstrates notable improvements in\nphenotype classification, identification of clinically meaningful subphenotypes\nthrough patient clustering, and prediction of disease progression compared to\nbaseline methods.

We\nstarted with a design space exploration, considering various factors such as\nthe type, duration, and timing of the auditory feedback. Then, we conducted\npilot studies to reduce the space of design choices and prototyped a system\ncalled WSCoach (Wearable Speech Coach), which informs users when they utter\nunwanted words in near-real-time.

The resulting generalization guarantees\nrecover standard Euclidean results when curvature is zero but improve\nsubstantially in settings where the data lies on curved, low-dimensional\nmanifolds embedded in high-dimensional ambient spaces. We illustrate the\ntightness of our bounds in negatively curved spaces, where the exponential\nvolume growth leads to provably higher complexity, and in positively curved\nspaces, where the curvature acts as a regularizing factor. This framework\nprovides a principled understanding of how intrinsic geometry affects learning\ncapacity, offering both theoretical insight and practical implications for deep\nlearning on structured data domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u9ece\u66fc\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u65b0\u6cdb\u5316\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u6d41\u5f62\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6cdb\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u8d56\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u975e\u6b27\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u6d41\u5f62\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\uff08\u5982\u622a\u9762\u66f2\u7387\u3001\u4f53\u79ef\u589e\u957f\u548c\u6ce8\u5165\u534a\u5f84\uff09\u63a8\u5bfc\u8986\u76d6\u6570\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u6539\u8fdbRademacher\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u66f2\u7387\u975e\u96f6\u7684\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\uff0c\u6cdb\u5316\u8fb9\u754c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u8d1f\u66f2\u7387\u548c\u6b63\u66f2\u7387\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u7d27\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5185\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

This can\nerode trust in digital media, making it critical to develop generalizable\ndetectors for generated images. Recent methods leverage diffusion denoising\ncues, but mainly focus on single-step reconstruction errors, ignoring the\ninherent sequential nature of the denoising process. In this work, we propose\nLATTE - Latent Trajectory Embedding - a novel approach that models the\nevolution of latent embeddings across several denoising timesteps. By modeling\nthe trajectory of such embeddings rather than single-step errors, LATTE\ncaptures subtle, discriminative patterns that distinguish real from generated\nimages. Each latent is refined by employing our latent-visual feature\nrefinement module and aggregated into a unified representation. Afterwards, it\nis fused with the visual features and finally passed into a lightweight\nclassifier.

Existing research commonly attributes\nhallucinations to technical limitations or sycophancy bias, where the latter\nmeans the models tend to generate incorrect answers to align with user\nexpectations. However, these explanations primarily focus on technical or\nexternally driven factors, may have neglected the possibility that\nhallucination behaviours might mirror cognitive biases observed in human\npsychology. In this work, we introduce a psychological taxonomy, categorizing\nVLMs' hallucination behaviours, including sycophancy, logical inconsistency,\nand a newly identified VLMs behaviour: authority bias. To systematically\nanalyze these behaviours, we design AIpsych, a scalable benchmark that reveals\npsychological tendencies in model response patterns. Leveraging this benchmark,\nwe investigate how variations in model architecture and parameter size\ninfluence model behaviour when responding to strategically manipulated\nquestions. Our experiments reveal that as model size increases, VLMs exhibit\nstronger sycophantic tendencies but reduced authority bias, suggesting\nincreasing competence but a potential erosion of response integrity. A human\nsubject study further validates our hypotheses and highlights key behavioural\ndifferences between VLMs and human respondents.

We prove this through a\nthree-level argument that leaves no escape routes for any class of universal\napproximator architecture. i) Combinatorial Necessity: For the vast majority of\npractical universal approximators (e.g., those using ReLU activations), we\nprove that the density of catastrophic failure points is directly proportional\nto the network's expressive power. ii) Topological Necessity: For any\ntheoretical universal approximator, we use singularity theory to prove that the\nability to approximate generic functions requires the ability to implement the\ndense, catastrophic singularities that characterize them. iii) Empirical\nNecessity: We prove that the universal existence of adversarial examples is\nempirical evidence that real-world tasks are themselves catastrophic, forcing\nany successful model to learn and replicate these instabilities. These results,\ncombined with a quantitative \"Impossibility Sandwich\" showing that the minimum\ncomplexity for usefulness exceeds the maximum complexity for safety,\ndemonstrate that perfect alignment is not an engineering challenge but a\nmathematical impossibility.

Recent advances in robotic reinforcement\nlearning (RL) have demonstrated remarkable performance and robustness in\nreal-world visuomotor control tasks. However, applying RL in the real world\nfaces challenges such as low sample efficiency, slow exploration, and\nsignificant reliance on human intervention. In contrast, simulators offer a\nsafe and efficient environment for extensive exploration and data collection,\nwhile the visual sim-to-real gap, often a limiting factor, can be mitigated\nusing real-to-sim techniques. Building on these, we propose SimLauncher, a\nnovel framework that combines the strengths of real-world RL and\nreal-to-sim-to-real approaches to overcome these challenges. Specifically, we\nfirst pre-train a visuomotor policy in the digital twin simulation environment,\nwhich then benefits real-world RL in two ways: (1) bootstrapping target values\nusing extensive simulated demonstrations and real-world demonstrations derived\nfrom pre-trained policy rollouts, and (2) Incorporating action proposals from\nthe pre-trained policy for better exploration.

To address this challenge, we propose\nOptimas, a unified framework for effective optimization of compound systems.\nThe core idea of Optimas is to maintain one Local Reward Function (LRF) per\ncomponent, each satisfying a local-global alignment property, i.e., each\ncomponent's local reward correlates with the global system performance. In each\niteration, Optimas efficiently adapts the LRFs to maintain this property while\nsimultaneously maximizing each component's local reward. This approach enables\nindependent updates of heterogeneous configurations using the designated\noptimization method, while ensuring that local improvements consistently lead\nto performance gains. We present extensive evaluations across five real-world\ncompound systems to demonstrate that Optimas outperforms strong baselines by an\naverage improvement of 11.92%, offering a general and effective approach for\nimproving compound systems.

However, its effectiveness has been primarily limited in\nshort-horizon tasks, and its performance significantly degrades in the presence\nof image noise. To address these limitations, we propose a VLM-guided\ntrajectory-conditioned diffusion policy (VLM-TDP) for robust and long-horizon\nmanipulation. Specifically, the proposed method leverages state-of-the-art\nvision-language models (VLMs) to decompose long-horizon tasks into concise,\nmanageable sub-tasks, while also innovatively generating voxel-based\ntrajectories for each sub-task. The generated trajectories serve as a crucial\nconditioning factor, effectively steering the diffusion policy and\nsubstantially enhancing its performance. The proposed Trajectory-conditioned\nDiffusion Policy (TDP) is trained on trajectories derived from demonstration\ndata and validated using the trajectories generated by the VLM. Simulation\nexperimental results indicate that our method significantly outperforms\nclassical diffusion policies, achieving an average 44% increase in success\nrate, over 100% improvement in long-horizon tasks, and a 20% reduction in\nperformance degradation in challenging conditions, such as noisy images or\naltered environments. These findings are further reinforced by our real-world\nexperiments, where the performance gap becomes even more pronounced in\nlong-horizon tasks.

However, HAR sensor signals are subject to significant domain\nshifts caused by subject variability. These domain shifts hinder model\ngeneralization to unseen subjects by embedding subject-specific variations\nrather than activity-specific features. As a result, human activity recognition\nmodels trained with contrastive learning often struggle to generalize to new\nsubjects. We introduce Subject-Invariant Contrastive Learning (SICL), a simple\nyet effective loss function to improve generalization in human activity\nrecognition.

As a result,\nthese methods struggle to maintain and respect consistent three-dimensional\ngeometric structure, underlying the scene. In this paper, we propose a novel\nconditioning approach, training method and adapter network that can be plugged\ninto pretrained text-to-image diffusion models. Our approach provides a way to\nendow such models with 3D-awareness, while leveraging their rich prior\nknowledge. Our method supports camera control, conditioning on explicit 3D\ngeometries and, for the first time, accounts for the entire context of a scene,\ni.e., both on and off-screen items, to synthesize plausible and semantically\nrich images.

The effect of regional consistency on\nclassification information learning and the rational use of dual-frequency data\nare two main difficulties for dual-frequency collaborative classification. To\ntackle these problems, a selected knowledge distillation network with\nstatistical-based sample rectification (SKDNet-SSR) is proposed in this\narticle. First, in addition to applying CNN and ViT as local and global feature\nextractors, a statistical-based dynamic sample rectification (SDSR) module is\ndesigned to avoid the impact of poor regional consistency on spatial\ninformation learning process. Specifically, based on the fact that the PolSAR\ncovariance matrix conforms to the complex Wishart distribution, SDSR first\ndynamically evaluates the sample purity, and then performs pixel selection and\npixel generation to remove noisy pixels, thereby avoiding the feature\ninteraction between informative pixels and noisy pixels and improving the\nclassification feature extraction process. Next, a dual-frequency gate-selected\ndistillation (DGSD) module is constructed to emphasize the advantages of\ndifferent frequency bands and perform complementary learning on dual-frequency\ndata. It uses the dominant single-frequency branch on each sample as teacher\nmodel to train the dual-frequency student model, enabling the student model to\nlearn the optimal results and realizing complementary utilization of\ndual-frequency data on different terrain objects.

Conventional\napproaches use probabilistic models to localize robots and build maps\nsimultaneously using sensor observations. Recent approaches employ\nhuman-inspired learning, such as imitation and reinforcement learning, to\nnavigate robots more effectively. However, these methods suffer from high\ncomputational costs, global map inconsistency, and poor generalization to\nunseen environments. This paper presents a novel method inspired by how humans\nperceive and navigate themselves effectively in novel environments.\nSpecifically, we first build local frames that mimic how humans represent\nessential spatial information in the short term. Points in local frames are\nhybrid representations, including spatial information and learned features,\nso-called spatial-implicit local frames.

In\nthis work, we introduce MolVision, a novel approach that leverages\nVision-Language Models (VLMs) by integrating both molecular structure as images\nand textual descriptions to enhance property prediction. We construct a\nbenchmark spanning ten diverse datasets, covering classification, regression\nand description tasks. Evaluating nine different VLMs in zero-shot, few-shot,\nand fine-tuned settings, we find that visual information improves prediction\nperformance, particularly when combined with efficient fine-tuning strategies\nsuch as LoRA.

To address this, we\npropose $\\mathrm{T}^2$-VLM, a novel training-free, temporally consistent\nframework that generates accurate rewards through tracking the status changes\nin VLM-derived subgoals.

IMMP follows a\ntwo-step process: pre-merging to capture agent behaviors and interactions,\nsufficiently extracting diverse information from the source domain, followed by\nmerging to construct an adaptable model that efficiently transfers diverse\ninteractions to the target domain. Our method is evaluated on various planning\nbenchmarks and models, demonstrating superior performance compared to\nconventional approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aIMMP\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u57df\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u7684\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u73af\u5883\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u7528\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u57df\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u57df\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u3001\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "IMMP\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u6b65\u6cd5\uff1a\u9884\u5408\u5e76\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u4ee3\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5145\u5206\u63d0\u53d6\u6e90\u57df\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u5408\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u8f6c\u79fb\u4ea4\u4e92\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u89c4\u5212\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cIMMP\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "IMMP\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\u6e90\u57df\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, the potential benefits of leveraging significantly larger\nsets of unlabeled images remain unexplored. In real-world scenarios, abundant\nunlabeled images are often available from online sources (web-scraped images)\nor large-scale datasets. However, these images may have different distributions\nfrom those of the target dataset, a situation known as out-of-distribution\n(OOD). Using these images as unlabeled data in semi-supervised learning can\nlead to inaccurate pseudo-labels, potentially misguiding network training. In\nthis paper, we propose a new semi-supervised semantic segmentation framework\nwith an open-vocabulary segmentation model (SemiOVS) to effectively utilize\nunlabeled OOD images. Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC and Context datasets\ndemonstrate two key findings: (1) using additional unlabeled images improves\nthe performance of semi-supervised learners in scenarios with few labels, and\n(2) using the open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) model to pseudo-label OOD\nimages leads to substantial performance gains.

Although existing DG techniques, such as data manipulation, learning\nstrategies, and representation learning, have shown significant progress, they\npredominantly address single-modal data. With the emergence of numerous\nmulti-modal datasets and increasing demand for multi-modal tasks, a key\nchallenge in Multi-modal Domain Generalization (MMDG) has emerged: enabling\nmodels trained on multi-modal sources to generalize to unseen target\ndistributions within the same modality set. Due to the inherent differences\nbetween modalities, directly transferring methods from single-modal DG to MMDG\ntypically yields sub-optimal results. These methods often exhibit randomness\nduring generalization due to the invisibility of target domains and fail to\nconsider inter-modal consistency. Applying these methods independently to each\nmodality in the MMDG setting before combining them can lead to divergent\ngeneralization directions across different modalities, resulting in degraded\ngeneralization capabilities.

It is typically applied\nwhen access to a labeled source domain is available. However, in real-world\nscenarios, privacy concerns often restrict access to sensitive information,\nsuch as fingerprints, bank account details, and facial images. A promising\nsolution to this issue is Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA),\nwhich enables domain adaptation without requiring access to labeled target\ndomain data. Recent research demonstrates that SFUDA can effectively address\ndomain discrepancies; however, two key challenges remain: (1) the low quality\nof prototype samples, and (2) the incorrect assignment of pseudo-labels. To\ntackle these challenges, we propose a method consisting of three main phases.\nIn the first phase, we introduce a Reliable Sample Memory (RSM) module to\nimprove the quality of prototypes by selecting more representative samples.

We demonstrate LaTF's effectiveness across\ndiverse systems, including a model potential, the Chignolin protein, and\ncluster of Lennard Jones particles, with thorough evaluations and benchmarking\nusing multiple metrics and extensive simulations.

To address this, we propose DESign, a\nnovel framework that incorporates Dynamic Context-Aware Convolution (DCAC) and\nSubnet Regularization Connectionist Temporal Classification (SR-CTC). DCAC\ndynamically captures the inter-frame motion cues that constitute signs and\nuniquely adapts convolutional weights in a fine-grained manner based on\ncontextual information, enabling the model to better generalize across diverse\nsigning behaviors and boost recognition accuracy. Furthermore, we observe that\nexisting methods still rely on only a limited number of frames for parameter\nupdates during training, indicating that CTC learning overfits to a dominant\npath. To address this, SR-CTC regularizes training by applying supervision to\nsubnetworks, encouraging the model to explore diverse CTC alignment paths and\neffectively preventing overfitting. A classifier-sharing strategy in SR-CTC\nfurther strengthens multi-scale consistency. Notably, SR-CTC introduces no\ninference overhead and can be seamlessly integrated into existing CSLR models\nto boost performance.

While zeroth-order (ZO) optimization provides a\nmemory-efficient alternative by eliminating backward passes, its application to\nmulti-hundred-billion-parameter models is constrained by GPU memory and compute\nthroughput. The ZO2 framework addresses the memory bottleneck by offloading\nmodel parameters to CPU memory and overlapping transformer block transfer with\ndual forward computation on a single GPU. However, ZO2 remains limited by its\nsingle-device execution and achieves modest throughput. In this work, we\npresent DistZO2, a high-throughput, memory-efficient framework for distributed\nzeroth-order fine-tuning of LLMs. DistZO2 introduces three parallel strategies:\n(1) Perturbation Parallelism (PertP), which parallelizes the two perturbed\nforward passes across devices; (2) Distributed Data Parallelism (DDP), adapted\nto the scalar-gradient nature of ZO training; and (3) a unified 2D Parallelism\ndesign that combines PertP and DDP.

However, existing methods\noften suffer from limited feature representation, computational redundancy, and\ninsufficient availability of high-quality training data -- challenges that\nhinder their ability to meet industrial demands for both accuracy and\nefficiency. To address these limitations, we propose MRC-DETR, a novel and\nefficient detection framework tailored for bare PCB defect inspection, built\nupon the foundation of RT-DETR. Firstly, to enhance feature representation\ncapability, we design a Multi-Residual Directional Coupled Block (MRDCB). This\nmodule improves channel-wise feature interaction through a multi-residual\nstructure. Moreover, a cross-spatial learning strategy is integrated to capture\nfine-grained pixel-level relationships, further enriching the representational\npower of the extracted features. Secondly, to reduce computational redundancy\ncaused by inefficient cross-layer information fusion, we introduce an Adaptive\nScreening Pyramid Network (ASPN). This component dynamically filters and\naggregates salient low-level features, selectively fusing them with high-level\nsemantic features.

Building on these efforts, we propose the Masked\nTemporal Interpolation Diffusion (MTID) model that introduces a latent space\ntemporal interpolation module within the diffusion model. This module leverages\na learnable interpolation matrix to generate intermediate latent features,\nthereby augmenting visual supervision with richer mid-state details. By\nintegrating this enriched supervision into the model, we enable end-to-end\ntraining tailored to task-specific requirements, significantly enhancing the\nmodel's capacity to predict temporally coherent action sequences. Additionally,\nwe introduce an action-aware mask projection mechanism to restrict the action\ngeneration space, combined with a task-adaptive masked proximity loss to\nprioritize more accurate reasoning results close to the given start and end\nstates over those in intermediate steps. Simultaneously, it filters out\ntask-irrelevant action predictions, leading to contextually aware action\nsequences.

The\ninterpretation of LiDAR and camera data achieves exceptional results but\ntypically requires to accumulate and process temporal sequences of data in\norder to extract motion information. In contrast, radar sensors, which are\nalready installed in most recent vehicles, can overcome this limitation as they\ndirectly provide the Doppler velocity of the detections and, hence incorporate\ninstantaneous motion information within a single measurement. % In this paper,\nwe tackle the problem of moving object segmentation in noisy radar point\nclouds.

Instead of exploiting temporal dependencies to identify\nmoving objects, we develop a novel transformer-based approach to perform\nsingle-scan moving object segmentation in sparse radar scans accurately. The\nkey to our Radar Velocity Transformer is to incorporate the valuable velocity\ninformation throughout each module of the network, thereby enabling the precise\nsegmentation of moving and non-moving objects. Additionally, we propose a\ntransformer-based upsampling, which enhances the performance by adaptively\ncombining information and overcoming the limitation of interpolation of sparse\npoint clouds. Finally, we create a new radar moving object segmentation\nbenchmark based on the RadarScenes dataset and compare our approach to other\nstate-of-the-art methods.

Current scene flow\nestimation methods for mmWave radar are typically supervised by dense point\nclouds from 3D LiDARs, which are expensive and not widely available in smart\nvehicles. While VI data are more accessible, visual images alone cannot capture\nthe 3D motions of moving objects, making it difficult to supervise their scene\nflow. Moreover, the temporal drift of VI rigid transformation also degenerates\nthe scene flow estimation of static points. To address these challenges, we\npropose a drift-free rigid transformation estimator that fuses kinematic\nmodel-based ego-motions with neural network-learned results. It provides strong\nsupervision signals to radar-based rigid transformation and infers the scene\nflow of static points.

Unsupervised and semi-supervised\nlearning for BEV tasks, as pivotal for real-world applications, underperform\ndue to the homogeneous distribution of the labeled data. In this work, we\nexplore the potential of synthetic data from driving world models to enhance\nthe diversity of labeled data for robustifying BEV segmentation.

To fully harness the potential of synthetic data\nfrom world models, this paper proposes NRSeg, a noise-resilient learning\nframework for BEV semantic segmentation. Specifically, a Perspective-Geometry\nConsistency Metric (PGCM) is proposed to quantitatively evaluate the guidance\ncapability of generated data for model learning. This metric originates from\nthe alignment measure between the perspective road mask of generated data and\nthe mask projected from the BEV labels.

(b) The performance of zero-shot generic foundation models improves on\nover-segmented face images than tightly cropped faces thereby suggesting the\nimportance of contextual clues. For example, at a False Match Rate (FMR) of\n0.01%, the True Match Rate (TMR) of OpenCLIP improved from 64.97% to 81.73% on\nthe LFW dataset as the face crop increased from 112x112 to 250x250 while the\nTMR of domain-specific AdaFace dropped from 99.09% to 77.31%. (c) A simple\nscore-level fusion of a foundation model with a domain-specific FR model\nimproved the accuracy at low FMRs. For example, the TMR of AdaFace when fused\nwith BLIP improved from 72.64% to 83.31% at an FMR of 0.0001% on the IJB-B\ndataset and from 73.17% to 85.81% on the IJB-C dataset.

Computed Tomography (CT) scan is considered one of the most\neffective methods for diagnosing brain strokes.

Project page: https://groundedgestures.github.io", "summary": "Human motion generation has advanced rapidly in recent years, yet the\ncritical problem of creating spatially grounded, context-aware gestures has\nbeen largely overlooked. Existing models typically specialize either in\ndescriptive motion generation, such as locomotion and object interaction, or in\nisolated co-speech gesture synthesis aligned with utterance semantics. However,\nboth lines of work often treat motion and environmental grounding separately,\nlimiting advances toward embodied, communicative agents. To address this gap,\nour work introduces a multimodal dataset and framework for grounded gesture\ngeneration, combining two key resources: (1) a synthetic dataset of spatially\ngrounded referential gestures, and (2) MM-Conv, a VR-based dataset capturing\ntwo-party dialogues. Together, they provide over 7.7 hours of synchronized\nmotion, speech, and 3D scene information, standardized in the HumanML3D format.\nOur framework further connects to a physics-based simulator, enabling synthetic\ndata generation and situated evaluation. By bridging gesture modeling and\nspatial grounding, our contribution establishes a foundation for advancing\nresearch in situated gesture generation and grounded multimodal interaction.\n  Project page: https://groundedgestures.github.io/", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a5\u5730\u7684\u59ff\u6001\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cVR\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u5177\u8eab\u4ea4\u4e92\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a5\u5730\u5206\u5f00\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5177\u8eab\u4ea4\u4e92\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u59ff\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a5\u5730\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cVR\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u8bed\u97f3\u548c3D\u573a\u666f\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u8fde\u63a5\u5230\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5305\u542b7.7\u5c0f\u65f6\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u4e3aHumanML3D\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a5\u5730\u7684\u59ff\u6001\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a5\u5730\u7684\u59ff\u6001\u751f\u6210\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u5177\u8eab\u4ea4\u4e92\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Intelligent roadside infrastructure perception systems, installed at\nelevated vantage points, can provide wide, unobstructed intersection coverage,\nsupplying a complementary information stream to autonomous vehicles via\nvehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. However, conventional 3D\nobject-detection algorithms struggle to generalize under the domain shift\nintroduced by top-down perspectives and steep camera angles. We introduce a\n2.5D object detection framework, tailored specifically for infrastructure\nroadside-mounted cameras. Unlike conventional 2D or 3D object detection, we\nemploy a prediction approach to detect ground planes of vehicles as\nparallelograms in the image frame. The parallelogram preserves the planar\nposition, size, and orientation of objects while omitting their height, which\nis unnecessary for most downstream applications. For training, a mix of\nreal-world and synthetically generated scenes is leveraged. We evaluate\ngeneralizability on a held-out camera viewpoint and in adverse-weather\nscenarios absent from the training set.

However, previous works focus on\nlearning prototypes only in the textual modality while overlooking the\nambiguous semantics in class names. These ambiguities lead to textual\nprototypes that are insufficient to capture visual concepts, resulting in\nlimited performance. To address this issue, we introduce \\textbf{ProtoMM}, a\ntraining-free framework that constructs multimodal prototypes to adapt VLMs\nduring the test time. By viewing the prototype as a discrete distribution over\nthe textual descriptions and visual particles, ProtoMM has the ability to\ncombine the multimodal features for comprehensive prototype learning. More\nimportantly, the visual particles are dynamically updated as the testing stream\nflows.

Importantly, when applied to neural populations, our method\nderives novel governing equations that respect biological constraints such as\nnetwork sparsity - a constraint necessary for cortical information processing\nyet not captured in next-generation neural mass models - while preserving\nmicroscale neuronal parameters. These equations predict an emergent\nrelationship between connection density and both oscillation frequency and\nsynchrony in neural circuits. We validate these predictions using three\nintracranial electrode recording datasets from the medial entorhinal cortex,\nprefrontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex.

Here, we developed MLASDO (Machine Learning based\nAnomalous Sample Detection on Omics), a new method and software tool to\nidentify, characterize and automatically describe anomalous samples based on\nomics data. Its workflow is based on three steps: (1) classification of healthy\nand cases individuals using a support vector machine algorithm; (2) detection\nof anomalous samples within groups; (3) explanation of anomalous individuals\nbased on clinical data and expert knowledge. We showcase MLASDO using\ntranscriptomics data of 317 healthy controls (HC) and 465 Parkinson's disease\n(PD) cases from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. In this cohort,\nMLASDO detected 15 anomalous HC with a PD-like transcriptomic signature and\nPD-like clinical features, including a lower proportion of CD4/CD8 naive\nT-cells and CD4 memory T-cells compared to HC (P<3.5*10^-3).

We consider a reaction-diffusion equation with\ndual spatial inputs, a nonlinear thermo-electrical problem with bidirectional\ncoupling through temperature-dependent conductivity, and a viscoplastic\nthermo-mechanical model of steel solidification governed by transient\nphase-driven interactions. Two operator-learning frameworks, the classical\nDeepONet and its sequential GRU-based extension, S-DeepONet, are benchmarked\nusing both single-branch and multi-branch (MIONet-style) architectures.

CosmoBench is the largest dataset of\nits kind: it contains 34 thousand point clouds from simulations of dark matter\nhalos and galaxies at three different length scales, as well as 25 thousand\ndirected trees that record the formation history of halos on two different time\nscales. The data in CosmoBench can be used for multiple tasks -- to predict\ncosmological parameters from point clouds and merger trees, to predict the\nvelocities of individual halos and galaxies from their collective positions,\nand to reconstruct merger trees on finer time scales from those on coarser time\nscales. We provide several baselines on these tasks, some based on established\napproaches from cosmological modeling and others rooted in machine learning.\nFor the latter, we study different approaches -- from simple linear models that\nare minimally constrained by symmetries to much larger and more\ncomputationally-demanding models in deep learning, such as graph neural\nnetworks. We find that least-squares fits with a handful of invariant features\nsometimes outperform deep architectures with many more parameters and far\nlonger training times. Still there remains tremendous potential to improve\nthese baselines by combining machine learning and cosmology to fully exploit\nthe data. CosmoBench sets the stage for bridging cosmology and geometric deep\nlearning at scale.

Business angels offer a\ncritical source of funding, but their decision-making is often subjective and\nresource-intensive for both investor and entrepreneur.

One such tool, the Critical Factor Assessment (CFA), deployed more\nthan 20,000 times by the Canadian Innovation Centre, has been evaluated\npost-decision and found to be significantly more accurate than investors' own\ndecisions.

In this research, we\nprompted multiple large language models (LLMs) to assign the eight CFA factors\nto a dataset of 600 transcribed, unstructured startup pitches seeking business\nangel funding with known investment outcomes.

As distance increases, intensified scattering leads to severe\nhaze and signal loss, making it impractical to recover distant details solely\nfrom visible images. Near-infrared, with superior fog penetration, offers\ncritical complementary cues through multimodal fusion. However, existing\nmethods focus on content integration while often neglecting haze embedded in\nvisible images, leading to results with residual haze. In this work, we argue\nthat the infrared and visible modalities not only provide complementary\nlow-level visual features, but also share high-level semantic consistency.\nMotivated by this, we propose a Hierarchical Semantic-Visual Fusion (HSVF)\nframework, comprising a semantic stream to reconstruct haze-free scenes and a\nvisual stream to incorporate structural details from the near-infrared\nmodality. The semantic stream first acquires haze-robust semantic prediction by\naligning modality-invariant intrinsic representations. Then the shared\nsemantics act as strong priors to restore clear and high-contrast distant\nscenes under severe haze degradation. In parallel, the visual stream focuses on\nrecovering lost structural details from near-infrared by fusing complementary\ncues from both visible and near-infrared images. Through the cooperation of\ndual streams, HSVF produces results that exhibit both high-contrast scenes and\nrich texture details.

However, most existing DG-based works have merely focused on\nmodeling statistical dependence between sensor data and activity labels,\nneglecting the importance of intrinsic casual mechanism. Intuitively, every\nsensor input can be viewed as a mixture of causal (category-aware) and\nnon-causal factors (domain-specific), where only the former affects activity\nclassification judgment. In this paper, by casting such DG-based HAR as a\ncasual inference problem, we propose a causality-inspired representation\nlearning algorithm for cross-domain activity recognition. To this end, an\nearly-forking two-branch framework is designed, where two separate branches are\nrespectively responsible for learning casual and non-causal features, while an\nindependence-based Hilbert-Schmidt Information Criterion is employed to\nimplicitly disentangling them. Additionally, an inhomogeneous domain sampling\nstrategy is designed to enhance disentanglement, while a category-aware domain\nperturbation layer is performed to prevent representation collapse. Extensive\nexperiments on several public HAR benchmarks demonstrate that our\ncausality-inspired approach significantly outperforms eleven related\nstate-of-the-art baselines under cross-person, cross-dataset, and\ncross-position settings.

However, the slow inference speed and high\ncomputational cost of these large models bring significant challenges for\npractical applications. Additionally, various tasks in human animation, such as\nlip-syncing, audio-driven full-body animation, and video generation from start\nand end frames, often require different specialized models. The introduction of\nlarge video models has not alleviated this dilemma. This raises an important\nquestion: Can we make human animation Faster, Higher in quality, Stronger in\ngeneralization, and make various tasks Together in one model? To address this,\nwe dive into video generation models and discover that the devil lies in the\ndetails: Inspired by MAE, we propose a novel unified Multi-Task paradigm for\nhuman animation, treating diverse generation tasks as spatial-temporal local\nreconstructions, requiring modifications only on the input side; Given the\ninterplay and division among multi-modal conditions including text, image, and\naudio, we introduce a multi-modal decoupled cross-attention module to fuse\nmulti-modals in a divide-and-conquer manner; We propose a new SFT+Reward\nalternating training paradigm, enabling the minimal model with 1.3B parameters\nto achieve generation quality comparable to models with 10 times the parameters\ncount. Through these innovations, our work paves the way for efficient,\nhigh-quality, and versatile digital human generation, addressing both\nperformance and practicality challenges in the field.

Existing low-light enhancement methods often\nstruggle to effectively preprocess such low-light inputs, as they fail to\nconsider correlations among multiple views. Although other state-of-the-art\nmethods have introduced illumination-related components offering alternative\nsolutions to the problem, they often result in drawbacks such as color\ndistortions and artifacts, and they provide limited denoising effectiveness. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel Robust Low-light Scene Restoration framework\n(RoSe), which enables effective synthesis of novel views in normal lighting\nconditions from low-light multiview image inputs, by formulating the task as an\nilluminance transition estimation problem in 3D space, conceptualizing it as a\nspecialized rendering task. This multiview-consistent illuminance transition\nfield establishes a robust connection between low-light and normal-light\nconditions. By further exploiting the inherent low-rank property of\nillumination to constrain the transition representation, we achieve more\neffective denoising without complex 2D techniques or explicit noise modeling.\nTo implement RoSe, we design a concise dual-branch architecture and introduce a\nlow-rank denoising module.

The framework mol-infer is primarily based on using\nmixed integer linear programming (MILP) to simulate the computational process\nof machine learning methods and describe the necessary and sufficient\nconditions to ensure such a chemical graph exists. The existing approaches\nusually first convert the chemical compounds into handcrafted feature vectors\nto construct prediction functions, but because of the limit on the kinds of\ndescriptors originated from the need for tractability in the MILP formulation,\nthe learning performances on datasets of some properties are not good enough. A\nlack of good learning performance can greatly lower the quality of the inferred\nchemical graphs, and thus improving learning performance is of great\nimportance. On the other hand, graph neural networks (GNN) offer a promising\nmachine learning method to directly utilize the chemical graphs as the input,\nand many existing GNN-based approaches to the molecular property prediction\nproblem have shown that they can enjoy better learning performances compared to\nthe traditional approaches that are based on feature vectors.

Despite significant\nadvancements, current models in this field, trained on particular domains\n(source domains), often exhibit unsatisfactory performance on unseen domains\n(target domains) due to domain gaps. To effectively realize such domain\ngeneralization on the short-video misinformation detection task, we propose\ndeep insights into the characteristics of different domains: (1) The detection\non various domains may mainly rely on different modalities (i.e., mainly\nfocusing on videos or audios). To enhance domain generalization, it is crucial\nto achieve optimal model performance on all modalities simultaneously. (2) For\nsome domains focusing on cross-modal joint fraud, a comprehensive analysis\nrelying on cross-modal fusion is necessary. However, domain biases located in\neach modality (especially in each frame of videos) will be accumulated in this\nfusion process, which may seriously damage the final identification of\nmisinformation. To address these issues, we propose a new DOmain generalization\nmodel via ConsisTency and invariance learning for shORt-video misinformation\ndetection (named DOCTOR), which contains two characteristic modules: (1) We\ninvolve the cross-modal feature interpolation to map multiple modalities into a\nshared space and the interpolation distillation to synchronize multi-modal\nlearning; (2) We design the diffusion model to add noise to retain core\nfeatures of multi modal and enhance domain invariant features through\ncross-modal guided denoising.

The quadratic\ncomputational complexity relative to window size restricts its ability to use a\nlarge window size for expanding the receptive field while maintaining low\ncomputational costs. To address this challenge, we propose PromptSR, a novel\nprompt-empowered lightweight image SR method. The core component is the\nproposed cascade prompting block (CPB), which enhances global information\naccess and local refinement via three cascaded prompting layers: a global\nanchor prompting layer (GAPL) and two local prompting layers (LPLs). The GAPL\nleverages downscaled features as anchors to construct low-dimensional anchor\nprompts (APs) through cross-scale attention, significantly reducing\ncomputational costs. These APs, with enhanced global perception, are then used\nto provide global prompts, efficiently facilitating long-range token\nconnections. The two LPLs subsequently combine category-based self-attention\nand window-based self-attention to refine the representation in a\ncoarse-to-fine manner. They leverage attention maps from the GAPL as additional\nglobal prompts, enabling them to perceive features globally at different\ngranularities for adaptive local refinement. In this way, the proposed CPB\neffectively combines global priors and local details, significantly enlarging\nthe receptive field while maintaining the low computational costs of our\nPromptSR. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method,\nwhich outperforms state-of-the-art lightweight SR methods in quantitative,\nqualitative, and complexity evaluations.

Its common\nsolution is to use a generator to synthesize fake data and use them as a\nsubstitute for real ID data. However, existing works typically assume teachers\nare trustworthy, leaving the robustness and security of DFKD from untrusted\nteachers largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct the first investigation\ninto distilling non-transferable learning (NTL) teachers using DFKD, where the\ntransferability from an ID domain to an out-of-distribution (OOD) domain is\nprohibited. We find that NTL teachers fool DFKD through divert the generator's\nattention from the useful ID knowledge to the misleading OOD knowledge.

To\nmitigate this issue, we propose Adversarial Trap Escaping (ATEsc) to benefit\nDFKD by identifying and filtering out OOD-like synthetic samples. Specifically,\ninspired by the evidence that NTL teachers show stronger adversarial robustness\non OOD samples than ID samples, we split synthetic samples into two groups\naccording to their robustness. The fragile group is treated as ID-like data and\nused for normal knowledge distillation, while the robust group is seen as\nOOD-like data and utilized for forgetting OOD knowledge.

Simulated data is used to show\na clear connection between the learned TM probability scores and the underlying\nprobabilities of the data. A visualization of the probability scores also\nreveals that the TM is less confident in its predictions outside the training\ndata domain, which contrasts the typical extrapolation phenomenon found in\nArtificial Neural Networks. The paper concludes with an application of the\nuncertainty quantification techniques on an image classification task using the\nCIFAR-10 dataset, where they provide new insights and suggest possible\nimprovements to current TM image classification models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8eTsetlin\u673a\u5668\uff08TM\uff09\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6982\u7387\u8bc4\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u6280\u672f\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u7387\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347Tsetlin\u673a\u5668\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4e86TM\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u6982\u7387\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u548cCIFAR-10\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6982\u7387\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u57fa\u7840\u6982\u7387\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u57df\u5916TM\u9884\u6d4b\u4fe1\u5fc3\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e0e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5916\u63a8\u73b0\u8c61\u5f62\u6210\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u6280\u672f\u4e3aTM\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Since the scene is changing over time, different generated views need\nto be consistent with the underlying 3D motions. While previous works learn\nsuch consistency by training from multiple views, the generated scene regions\nare bounded to be close to the training views with limited camera movements. To\naddress this issue, we propose DynamicVoyager that reformulates the dynamic\nscene generation as a scene outpainting process for new dynamic content. As 2D\noutpainting models can hardly generate 3D consistent motions from only 2D\npixels at a single view, we consider pixels as rays to enrich the pixel input\nwith the ray context, so that the 3D motion consistency can be learned from the\nray information. More specifically, we first map the single-view video input to\na dynamic point cloud with the estimated video depths. Then we render the\npartial video at a novel view and outpaint the video with ray contexts from the\npoint cloud to generate 3D consistent motions. We employ the outpainted video\nto update the point cloud, which is used for scene outpainting from future\nnovel views. Experiments show that our model is able to generate unbounded\nscenes with consistent motions along fly-through cameras, and the generated\ncontents can be controlled with scene prompts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faDynamicVoyager\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u573a\u666f\u5916\u7ed8\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4ece\u5355\u89c6\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u65e0\u8fb9\u754c\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u4ece\u5355\u89c6\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u65e0\u8fb9\u754c\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a/\u865a\u62df\u73b0\u5b9e\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9886\u57df\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u4f9d\u8d56\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u573a\u666f\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5355\u89c6\u56fe\u89c6\u9891\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u70b9\u4e91\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c04\u7ebf\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5916\u7ed8\u89c6\u9891\u4ee5\u751f\u62103D\u4e00\u81f4\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u7ed8\u89c6\u9891\u66f4\u65b0\u70b9\u4e91\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u65e0\u8fb9\u754c\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u793a\u63a7\u5236\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "conclusion": "DynamicVoyager\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5355\u89c6\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u76843D\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002"}}

The proposed method ensures an efficient selection\nof the most informative data points for training while avoiding redundant or\nless beneficial computations. Preserving data points in each batch is performed\nbased on spectral analysis. A Fiedler vector-based scoring mechanism removes\nthe filtered portion of the batch, lightening the resource requirements of the\nlearning. The proposed data selection approach not only streamlines the\ntraining process but also promotes improved generalization and accuracy.\nExtensive experiments on standard image classification benchmarks, including\nCIFAR-10, Oxford-IIIT Pet, and Oxford-Flowers, demonstrate that GSTDS\noutperforms standard training scenarios and JEST, a recent state-of-the-art\ndata curation method, on several key factors.

The first two chapters view inverse reinforcement learning\n(IRL) through the lens of revealed preferences from microeconomics while the\nthird chapter studies adaptive IRL via Langevin dynamics stochastic gradient\nalgorithms.\n  Chapter uses classical revealed preference theory (Afriat's theorem and\nextensions) to identify constrained utility maximizers based on observed agent\nactions. This allows for the reconstruction of set-valued estimates of an\nagent's utility. We illustrate this procedure by identifying the presence of a\ncognitive radar and reconstructing its utility function. The chapter also\naddresses the construction of a statistical detector for utility maximization\nbehavior when agent actions are corrupted by noise.\n  Chapter 2 studies Bayesian IRL. It investigates how an analyst can determine\nif an observed agent is a rationally inattentive Bayesian utility maximizer\n(i.e., simultaneously optimizing its utility and observation likelihood). The\nchapter discusses inverse stopping-time problems, focusing on reconstructing\nthe continuation and stopping costs of a Bayesian agent operating over a random\nhorizon. We then apply this IRL methodology to identify the presence of a\nBayes-optimal sequential detector. Additionally, Chapter 2 provides a concise\noverview of discrete choice models, inverse Bayesian filtering, and inverse\nstochastic gradient algorithms for adaptive IRL.\n  Finally, Chapter 3 introduces an adaptive IRL approach utilizing passive\nLangevin dynamics. This method aims to track time-varying utility functions\ngiven noisy and misspecified gradients.

Finally, we empirically evaluate the VGD condition across\nseveral standard environments, demonstrating the practical relevance of our key\nassumption.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u65e0\u5047\u8bbe\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5173\u952e\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u7c7b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u8fd9\u4e00\u5047\u8bbe\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u6210\u7acb\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u5047\u8bbe\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u901a\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u975e\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1aSteepest Descent Policy Optimization\u3001\u6539\u8fdb\u7684Conservative Policy Iteration\u7b97\u6cd5\u548cPolicy Mirror Descent\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u7248\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u53d8\u5206\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u52bf\uff08VGD\uff09\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u51f8\u7b56\u7565\u7c7b\u4e0b\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86VGD\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u5047\u8bbe\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ecd\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e14VGD\u6761\u4ef6\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

By\ncasting the attack process as a resource allocation problem between\noptimization and sampling, we determine compute-optimal tradeoffs and show that\nintegrating sampling into existing attacks boosts ASR by up to 48% and improves\nefficiency by up to two orders of magnitude.

Despite the large volume of research\nworks in the field, a structured and complete survey on VHGR is still missing,\nleaving researchers to navigate through hundreds of papers in order to find the\nright combination of data, model, and approach for each task.

Starting with the methodology\nused for study selection, literature retrieval, and the analytical framing, the\nsurvey identifies and organizes key VHGR approaches using a taxonomy-based\nformat in various dimensions such as input modality and application domain. The\ncore of the survey provides an in-depth analysis of state-of-the-art techniques\nacross three primary VHGR tasks: static gesture recognition, isolated dynamic\ngestures and continuous gesture recognition.

However, real-world data collection is often biased toward\ncommon scenes and objects, leaving novel cases underrepresented. This imbalance\nhinders model generalization and compromises safety. The core issue is the\ncurse of rarity. Over time, novel events occur infrequently, and standard\nlogging methods fail to capture them effectively. As a result, large volumes of\nredundant data are stored, while critical novel cases are diluted, leading to\nbiased datasets. This work presents a real-time data selection method focused\non object-level novelty detection to build more balanced and diverse datasets.\nThe method assigns a data-driven novelty score to image frames using a novel\ndynamic Mean Shift algorithm. It models normal content based on mean and\ncovariance statistics to identify frames with novel objects, discarding those\nwith redundant elements. The main findings show that reducing the training\ndataset size with this method can improve model performance, whereas higher\nredundancy tends to degrade it. Moreover, as data redundancy increases, more\naggressive filtering becomes both possible and beneficial.

In the first\nstage, we design a radar guided iterative (RGIter) BEV fusion module to\ngenerate high-recall 3D proposal boxes. In the second stage, we aggregate\nfeatures from multiple heterogeneous views including points, image, and BEV for\neach proposal. These comprehensive instance level features greatly help refine\nthe proposals and generate high-quality predictions. Extensive experiments on\npublic datasets show that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art\nmethods by a large margin, with 9.10% and 3.68% mAP improvements on\nView-of-Delft (VoD) and TJ4DRadSet, respectively.

Despite notable success, existing approaches are limited by their\nreliance on sparse slide-level labels, which hinders the learning of\ndiscriminative repre-sentations from gigapixel WSIs. Recently, vision language\n(VL) models, which incorporate additional language supervision, have emerged as\na promising solu-tion. However, VL-based survival prediction remains largely\nunexplored due to two key challenges. First, current methods often rely on only\none simple lan-guage prompt and basic cosine similarity, which fails to learn\nfine-grained associ-ations between multi-faceted linguistic information and\nvisual features within WSI, resulting in inadequate vision-language alignment.\nSecond, these methods primarily exploit patch-level information, overlooking\nthe intrinsic hierarchy of WSIs and their interactions, causing ineffective\nmodeling of hierarchical interac-tions. To tackle these problems, we propose a\nnovel Hierarchical vision-Language collaboration (HiLa) framework for improved\nsurvival prediction. Specifically, HiLa employs pretrained feature extractors\nto generate hierarchical visual features from WSIs at both patch and region\nlevels. At each level, a series of language prompts describing various\nsurvival-related attributes are constructed and aligned with visual features\nvia Optimal Prompt Learning (OPL). This ap-proach enables the comprehensive\nlearning of discriminative visual features cor-responding to different\nsurvival-related attributes from prompts, thereby improv-ing vision-language\nalignment.

This uncertainty is\nparticularly significant in the case of fine-grained local occlusion and frame\nloss, which becomes a challenge in multi-modal learning. To address the above\nchallenge, we propose a robust approach named Uncertainty-Guided Graph model\nfor multi-modal object ReID (UGG-ReID).

This process boosts the\nexpressiveness of modal-specific information, ensuring that the generated\nembeddings are both more informative and robust.

Although numerous general 3D shape generation\nmethods have been proposed, most of them focus on single-object generation and\nare insufficient for generating anatomically structured teeth models, each\ncomprising 24-32 segmented teeth.

Unlike previous methods, we cast shadow\nremoval as diffusion-based inpainting. To this end, we first train a\nshadow-independent structure extraction network on a real-world portrait\ndataset with various synthetic lighting conditions, which allows to generate a\nshadow-independent structure map including facial details while excluding the\nunwanted shadow boundaries. The structure map is then used as condition to\ntrain a structure-guided inpainting diffusion model for removing shadows in a\ngenerative manner. Finally, to restore the fine-scale details (e.g., eyelashes,\nmoles and spots) that may not be captured by the structure map, we take the\ngradients inside the shadow regions as guidance and train a detail restoration\ndiffusion model to refine the shadow removal result. Extensive experiments on\nthe benchmark datasets show that our method clearly outperforms existing\nmethods, and is effective to avoid previously common issues such as facial\nidentity tampering, shadow residual, color distortion, structure blurring, and\nloss of details.

Existing methods address\nstructural isolation by degrading graph learning models to MLPs for cold-start\ninference, using a teacher model (with graph access) to guide the MLP. However,\nthis results in limited model capacity in the student, which is further\nchallenged when modalities are missing. In this paper, we propose\nNeighbor-to-Self Graph Transformer (NTSFormer), a unified Graph Transformer\nframework that jointly tackles the isolation and missing-modality issues via a\nself-teaching paradigm.

In this work, we empirically analyze how neural\nnetworks behave under data and model scaling through the lens of the neural\ntangent kernel (NTK). This analysis establishes a link between performance\nscaling and the internal dynamics of neural networks. Our findings of standard\nvision tasks show that similar performance scaling exponents can occur even\nthough the internal model dynamics show opposite behavior. This demonstrates\nthat performance scaling alone is insufficient for understanding the underlying\nmechanisms of neural networks.

In the selecting step, based on the estimated accuracy\ndrops for all layers, we propose a greedy strategy to automatically select a\nset of layers that will lead to less overall accuracy drop after pruning these\nlayers. In the pruning step, we prune a small number of channels from these\nselected layers. We further extend our PCP framework to prune channels for the\ndeep transfer learning methods like Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN),\nin which we effectively reduce the data distribution mismatch in the channel\npruning process by using both labelled samples from the source domain and\npseudo-labelled samples from the target domain. Our comprehensive experiments\non two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our PCP framework outperforms the\nexisting channel pruning approaches under both supervised learning and transfer\nlearning settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u901a\u9053\u526a\u679d\uff08PCP\uff09\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u526a\u679d\u5c11\u91cf\u901a\u9053\u6765\u52a0\u901f\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08CNN\uff09\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u901a\u9053\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u9010\u5c42\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u8f83\u5927\u3002PCP\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u526a\u679d\u51cf\u5c11\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u3002", "method": "PCP\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u6b65\u6d41\u7a0b\uff08\u5c1d\u8bd5-\u9009\u62e9-\u526a\u679d\uff09\u8fed\u4ee3\u526a\u679d\uff1a1\uff09\u5c1d\u8bd5\u526a\u679d\u5e76\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u9009\u62e9\u526a\u679d\u5c42\uff1b3\uff09\u526a\u679d\u5c11\u91cf\u901a\u9053\u3002\u8fd8\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPCP\u5728\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "PCP\u901a\u8fc7\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u526a\u679d\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

To address this gap, we introduce PRING, the\nfirst comprehensive benchmark that evaluates protein-protein interaction\nprediction from a graph-level perspective.

Unlike conventional video captions, which are typically\nbrief and widely available, long-form paragraph descriptions in natural\nlanguage are scarce. This limitation of current datasets is due to the\nexpensive human manual annotation required and to the highly challenging task\nof explaining the language formation process from the perspective of the\nunderlying story, as a complex system of interconnected events in space and\ntime. Through a thorough analysis of recently published methods and available\ndatasets, we identify a general lack of published resources dedicated to the\nproblem of describing videos in complex language, beyond the level of\ndescriptions in the form of enumerations of simple captions. Furthermore, while\nstate-of-the-art methods produce impressive results on the task of generating\nshorter captions from videos by direct end-to-end learning between the videos\nand text, the problem of explaining the relationship between vision and\nlanguage is still beyond our reach. In this work, we propose a shared\nrepresentation between vision and language, based on graphs of events in space\nand time, which can be obtained in an explainable and analytical way, to\nintegrate and connect multiple vision tasks to produce the final natural\nlanguage description. Moreover, we also demonstrate how our automated and\nexplainable video description generation process can function as a fully\nautomatic teacher to effectively train direct, end-to-end neural student\npathways, within a self-supervised neuro-analytical system.

SAR vessel detection has previously been\ndemonstrated only by ML models that either are too large for satellite\ndeployment, have not been developed for sufficiently low-power hardware, or\nhave only been developed and tested on small SAR datasets that do not\nsufficiently represent the real-world task. Here we address this issue by\ndeveloping and deploying a new efficient and highly performant SAR vessel\ndetection model, using a customised YOLOv8 architecture specifically optimized\nfor FPGA-based processing within common satellite power constraints (<10W). We\ntrain and evaluate our model on the largest and most diverse open SAR vessel\ndataset, xView3-SAR, and deploy it on a Kria KV260 MPSoC. We show that our\nFPGA-based model has detection and classification performance only ~2% and 3%\nlower than values from state-of-the-art GPU-based models, despite being two to\nthree orders of magnitude smaller in size. This work demonstrates small yet\nhighly performant ML models for time-critical SAR analysis, paving the way for\nmore autonomous, responsive, and scalable Earth observation systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684SAR\u8239\u53ea\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u7684YOLOv8\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u536b\u661f\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u4f4e\u529f\u8017FPGA\u786c\u4ef6\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1GPU\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u536b\u661f\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u5de8\u5927\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5730\u9762\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u5f0f\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684ML\u6a21\u578b\u53c8\u56e0\u4f53\u79ef\u6216\u529f\u8017\u95ee\u9898\u96be\u4ee5\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u536b\u661f\u4e0a\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728SAR\u8239\u53ea\u68c0\u6d4b\u8fd9\u4e00\u65f6\u95f4\u654f\u611f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u7684YOLOv8\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9FPGA\u5904\u7406\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5728xView3-SAR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u90e8\u7f72\u5728Kria KV260 MPSoC\u4e0a\u3002", "result": "FPGA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u4ec5\u6bd4GPU\u6a21\u578b\u4f4e\u7ea62%\u548c3%\uff0c\u4f46\u4f53\u79ef\u5c0f2-3\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u529f\u8017\u4f4e\u4e8e10W\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5c0f\u578b\u9ad8\u6027\u80fdML\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5173\u952eSAR\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u81ea\u4e3b\u3001\u54cd\u5e94\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u5730\u7403\u89c2\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

While often regarded as unpredictable artifacts,\nwe argue that these failures reflect deeper, structured misalignments within\nthe generative process. In this work, we propose a cognitively inspired\nperspective that reinterprets hallucinations as trajectory drift within a\nlatent alignment space. Empirical observations reveal that generation unfolds\nwithin a multiaxial cognitive tension field, where the model must continuously\nnegotiate competing demands across three key critical axes: semantic coherence,\nstructural alignment, and knowledge grounding. We then formalize this\nthree-axis space as the \\textbf{Hallucination Tri-Space} and introduce the\nAlignment Risk Code (ARC): a dynamic vector representation that quantifies\nreal-time alignment tension during generation. The magnitude of ARC captures\noverall misalignment, its direction identifies the dominant failure axis, and\nits imbalance reflects tension asymmetry. Based on this formulation, we develop\nthe TensionModulator (TM-ARC): a lightweight controller that operates entirely\nin latent space.

Despite\nexisting studies having made substantial progress, they often overlook the\nissue of spurious correlations between video and textual queries. These\nspurious correlations arise from two primary factors: (1) inherent biases in\nthe textual data, such as frequent co-occurrences of specific verbs or phrases,\nand (2) the model's tendency to overfit to salient or repetitive patterns in\nvideo content. Such biases mislead the model into associating textual cues with\nincorrect visual moments, resulting in unreliable predictions and poor\ngeneralization to out-of-distribution examples. To overcome these limitations,\nwe propose a novel TSG framework, causal intervention and counterfactual\nreasoning that utilizes causal inference to eliminate spurious correlations and\nenhance the model's robustness. Specifically, we first formulate the TSG task\nfrom a causal perspective with a structural causal model. Then, to address\nunobserved confounders reflecting textual biases toward specific verbs or\nphrases, a textual causal intervention is proposed, utilizing do-calculus to\nestimate the causal effects. Furthermore, visual counterfactual reasoning is\nperformed by constructing a counterfactual scenario that focuses solely on\nvideo features, excluding the query and fused multi-modal features.

Alignment for Answerability in Video Large Language Models", "comment": "ICLR 2025", "summary": "In the broader context of deep learning, Multimodal Large Language Models\nhave achieved significant breakthroughs by leveraging powerful Large Language\nModels as a backbone to align different modalities into the language space. A\nprime exemplification is the development of Video Large Language Models\n(Video-LLMs). While numerous advancements have been proposed to enhance the\nvideo understanding capabilities of these models, they are predominantly\ntrained on questions generated directly from video content. However, in\nreal-world scenarios, users often pose questions that extend beyond the\ninformational scope of the video, highlighting the need for Video-LLMs to\nassess the relevance of the question.

Extensive evaluations on three large ophthalmic\nmultimodal datasets demonstrate our model's superior performance under various\nmodality-incomplete scenarios, achieving Sota performance in both complete\nmodality and inter-modality incompleteness conditions.

Traditional models for CVS recognition depend on\nvision-only models learning with costly, labor-intensive spatial annotations.\nThis study investigates how text can be harnessed as a powerful tool for both\ntraining and inference in multi-modal surgical foundation models to automate\nCVS recognition. Unlike many existing multi-modal models, which are primarily\nadapted for multi-class classification, CVS recognition requires a multi-label\nframework. Zero-shot evaluation of existing multi-modal surgical models shows a\nsignificant performance gap for this task. To address this, we propose\nCVS-AdaptNet, a multi-label adaptation strategy that enhances fine-grained,\nbinary classification across multiple labels by aligning image embeddings with\ntextual descriptions of each CVS criterion using positive and negative prompts.\nBy adapting PeskaVLP, a state-of-the-art surgical foundation model, on the\nEndoscapes-CVS201 dataset, CVS-AdaptNet achieves 57.6 mAP, improving over the\nResNet50 image-only baseline (51.5 mAP) by 6 points. Our results show that\nCVS-AdaptNet's multi-label, multi-modal framework, enhanced by textual prompts,\nboosts CVS recognition over image-only methods. We also propose text-specific\ninference methods, that helps in analysing the image-text alignment. While\nfurther work is needed to match state-of-the-art spatial annotation-based\nmethods, this approach highlights the potential of adapting generalist models\nto specialized surgical tasks.

Traditional models, built for one task at a time, lack\nflexibility, requiring a separate model for each. To address this, we introduce\nMML-SurgAdapt, a unified multi-task framework with Vision-Language Models\n(VLMs), specifically CLIP, to handle diverse surgical tasks through natural\nlanguage supervision. A key challenge in multi-task learning is the presence of\npartial annotations when integrating different tasks. To overcome this, we\nemploy Single Positive Multi-Label (SPML) learning, which traditionally reduces\nannotation burden by training models with only one positive label per instance.\nOur framework extends this approach to integrate data from multiple surgical\ntasks within a single procedure, enabling effective learning despite incomplete\nor noisy annotations.

Extensive evaluation shows that MML-SurgAdapt\nperforms comparably to task-specific benchmarks, with the added advantage of\nhandling noisy annotations.

To better understand the\nvulnerability of autoregressive image generative models to such detection, we\nconduct the first study applying membership inference to this domain.

First, we compute the implicit token-wise\nclassification score within the query image. Then we propose an adaptive score\naggregation strategy to acquire a final score, which places greater emphasis on\nthe tokens with lower scores. A higher final score indicates that the sample is\nmore likely to be involved in the training set.
