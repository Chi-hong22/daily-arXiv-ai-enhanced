However, the accumulated noise\nin such dense representations has received insufficient attention, which\ndegrades the representation quality and increases the likelihood of missed\ndetections. To address this challenge, we propose the Wavelet\nDenoising-enhanced DEtection TRansformer, i.e., WD-DETR network, for event\ncameras. In particular, a dense event representation is presented first, which\nenables real-time reconstruction of events as tensors. Then, a wavelet\ntransform method is designed to filter noise in the event representations. Such\na method is integrated into the backbone for feature extraction. The extracted\nfeatures are subsequently fed into a transformer-based network for object\nprediction. To further reduce inference time, we incorporate the Dynamic\nReorganization Convolution Block (DRCB) as a fusion module within the hybrid\nencoder. The proposed method has been evaluated on three event-based object\ndetection datasets, i.e., DSEC, Gen1, and 1Mpx. The results demonstrate that\nWD-DETR outperforms tested state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we implement\nour approach on a common onboard computer for robots, the NVIDIA Jetson Orin\nNX, achieving a high frame rate of approximately 35 FPS using TensorRT FP16,\nwhich is exceptionally well-suited for real-time perception of onboard robotic\nsystems."}

Non-prehensile\ntransport can significantly improve transport efficiency, as it enables\nhandling multiple objects simultaneously and accommodating objects unsuitable\nfor parallel-jaw or suction grasps. Existing approaches incorporate constraints\nbased on the Coulomb friction model, which is imprecise during fast motions\nwhere inherent mechanical vibrations occur.

However, most existing AV safety evaluation methods are primarily\ndesigned for simple maneuvers such as car-following and lane-changing. While\nsuitable for basic tests, these methods are insufficient for assessing\nhigh-level automation functions deployed in more complex environments. First,\nthese methods typically use crash rate as the evaluation metric, whose accuracy\nheavily depends on the quality and completeness of naturalistic driving\nenvironment data used to estimate scenario probabilities. Such data is often\ndifficult and expensive to collect. Second, when applied to diverse scenarios,\nthese methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality, making large-scale\nevaluation computationally intractable. To address these challenges, this paper\nproposes a novel framework for full-scenario AV safety evaluation. A unified\nmodel is first introduced to standardize the representation of diverse driving\nscenarios. This modeling approach constrains the dimension of most scenarios to\na regular highway setting with three lanes and six surrounding background\nvehicles, significantly reducing dimensionality. To further avoid the\nlimitations of probability-based method, we propose a volume-based evaluation\nmethod that quantifies the proportion of risky scenarios within the entire\nscenario space.

Focusing\non multi-agent task allocation problems, our goal is to study this question\nfrom the perspective of reward design: what kinds of objectives are best suited\nfor heterogeneous teams? We first consider an instantaneous, non-spatial\nsetting where the global reward is built by two generalized aggregation\noperators: an inner operator that maps the $N$ agents' effort allocations on\nindividual tasks to a task score, and an outer operator that merges the $M$\ntask scores into the global team reward. We prove that the curvature of these\noperators determines whether heterogeneity can increase reward, and that for\nbroad reward families this collapses to a simple convexity test. Next, we ask\nwhat incentivizes heterogeneity to emerge when embodied, time-extended agents\nmust learn an effort allocation policy. To study heterogeneity in such\nsettings, we use multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) as our computational\nparadigm, and introduce Heterogeneous Environment Design (HED), a\ngradient-based algorithm that optimizes the parameter space of underspecified\nMARL environments to find scenarios where heterogeneity is advantageous.\nExperiments in matrix games and an embodied Multi-Goal-Capture environment show\nthat, despite the difference in settings, HED rediscovers the reward regimes\npredicted by our theory to maximize the advantage of heterogeneity, both\nvalidating HED and connecting our theoretical insights to reward design in\nMARL. Together, these results help us understand when behavioral diversity\ndelivers a measurable benefit."}

Generative AI offers potential for this task, but faces\nchallenges in stable generation (consistent outputs) and valid generation\n(error-free sequences). Existing methods--traditional MLs' low validity and\nLLMs' instability--fail to resolve both. We find that LLMs ensure valid syntax,\nwhile ML's gradient-steered search stabilizes performance. To bridge this gap,\nwe propose a teaming framework combining LLMs' symbolic generation with ML's\ngradient optimization. This framework includes four steps: (1) golden examples\ngeneration, aiming to prepare high-quality samples with the ground knowledge of\nthe teacher LLM; (2) feature transformation sequence embedding and search,\nintending to uncover potentially superior embeddings within the latent space;\n(3) student LLM feature transformation, aiming to distill knowledge from the\nteacher LLM; (4) LLM-ML decoder teaming, dedicating to combine ML and the\nstudent LLM probabilities for valid and stable generation.

Moreover, existing diffusion policies model a time-varying action\ndenoising process, whose temporal complexity increases the difficulty of model\ntraining and leads to suboptimal action accuracy. To generate robot actions\nefficiently and accurately, we present the Time-Unified Diffusion Policy\n(TUDP), which utilizes action recognition capabilities to build a time-unified\ndenoising process.

Participants completed a Method of\nConstant Stimulus study while holding the device with three different grasps.\nStimuli direction occurred both toward and away from the thumb, while the\nstandard stimuli varied between small (0.48 mm) and large (6 mm). Our results\nindicate that translational SCHIs should maximize the translation magnitude\nrather than the number of fingers in contact. We also demonstrated how to apply\nour findings to real-world applications via a simple 'paddle game', where we\ncompared conventional linear mapping with non-linear mapping derived from our\nperceptual experiment outcomes between the device position and its represented\nvalue. Results indicate that the non-linear mapping was more effective, with\nimproved error distribution. We hope this work inspires further formal\nperceptual investigation into other SCHI morphologies."}

In this\nwork, we propose a Segment Anything Model (SAM)-guided Reliable Pseudo-Labels\nmethod for SFDA (SRPL-SFDA) with three key components: 1) Test-Time Tri-branch\nIntensity Enhancement (T3IE) that not only improves quality of raw\npseudo-labels in the target domain, but also leads to SAM-compatible inputs\nwith three channels to better leverage SAM's zero-shot inference ability for\nrefining the pseudo-labels; 2) A reliable pseudo-label selection module that\nrejects low-quality pseudo-labels based on Consistency of Multiple SAM Outputs\n(CMSO) under input perturbations with T3IE; and 3) A reliability-aware training\nprocedure in the unlabeled target domain where reliable pseudo-labels are used\nfor supervision and unreliable parts are regularized by entropy minimization.\nExperiments conducted on two multi-domain medical image segmentation datasets\nfor fetal brain and the prostate respectively demonstrate that: 1) SRPL-SFDA\neffectively enhances pseudo-label quality in the unlabeled target domain, and\nimproves SFDA performance by leveraging the reliability-aware training; 2)\nSRPL-SFDA outperformed state-of-the-art SFDA methods, and its performance is\nclose to that of supervised training in the target domain.

Although the feedforward approach achieves high\nreconstruction speed, it still suffers from the substantial storage cost of 3D\nGaussians. Existing 3DGS compression methods relying on scene-wise optimization\nare not applicable due to architectural incompatibilities. To overcome this\nlimitation, we propose TinySplat, a complete feedforward approach for\ngenerating compact 3D scene representations. Built upon standard feedforward\n3DGS methods, TinySplat integrates a training-free compression framework that\nsystematically eliminates key sources of redundancy. Specifically, we introduce\nView-Projection Transformation (VPT) to reduce geometric redundancy by\nprojecting geometric parameters into a more compact space. We further present\nVisibility-Aware Basis Reduction (VABR), which mitigates perceptual redundancy\nby aligning feature energy along dominant viewing directions via basis\ntransformation. Lastly, spatial redundancy is addressed through an\noff-the-shelf video codec. Comprehensive experimental results on multiple\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate that TinySplat achieves over 100x compression\nfor 3D Gaussian data generated by feedforward methods.

To address these\nlimitations, we propose HAIF-GS, a unified framework that enables structured\nand consistent dynamic modeling through sparse anchor-driven deformation.

While some approaches focus on capturing\nstructural information, they use a generalized representation for documents,\nneglecting the word-level semantic modeling. In this paper, we propose Symbolic\nGraph Ranker (SGR), which aims to take advantage of both text-based and\ngraph-based approaches by leveraging the power of recent Large Language Models\n(LLMs). Concretely, we first introduce a set of symbolic grammar rules to\nconvert session graph into text. This allows integrating session history,\ninteraction process, and task instruction seamlessly as inputs for the LLM.\nMoreover, given the natural discrepancy between LLMs pre-trained on textual\ncorpora, and the symbolic language we produce using our graph-to-text grammar,\nour objective is to enhance LLMs' ability to capture graph structures within a\ntextual format. To achieve this, we introduce a set of self-supervised symbolic\nlearning tasks including link prediction, node content generation, and\ngenerative contrastive learning, to enable LLMs to capture the topological\ninformation from coarse-grained to fine-grained. Experiment results and\ncomprehensive analysis on two benchmark datasets, AOL and Tiangong-ST, confirm\nthe superiority of our approach. Our paradigm also offers a novel and effective\nmethodology that bridges the gap between traditional search strategies and\nmodern LLMs."}

However, the accumulated noise\nin such dense representations has received insufficient attention, which\ndegrades the representation quality and increases the likelihood of missed\ndetections. To address this challenge, we propose the Wavelet\nDenoising-enhanced DEtection TRansformer, i.e., WD-DETR network, for event\ncameras. In particular, a dense event representation is presented first, which\nenables real-time reconstruction of events as tensors. Then, a wavelet\ntransform method is designed to filter noise in the event representations. Such\na method is integrated into the backbone for feature extraction. The extracted\nfeatures are subsequently fed into a transformer-based network for object\nprediction. To further reduce inference time, we incorporate the Dynamic\nReorganization Convolution Block (DRCB) as a fusion module within the hybrid\nencoder. The proposed method has been evaluated on three event-based object\ndetection datasets, i.e., DSEC, Gen1, and 1Mpx. The results demonstrate that\nWD-DETR outperforms tested state-of-the-art methods.

As the diffusion\nmodel has better training robustness than other generative models, it performs\nwell in imitation learning through successful robot demonstrations. However,\nthe diffusion-based policy methods typically require significant time to\niteratively denoise robot actions, which hinders real-time responses in robotic\nmanipulation. Moreover, existing diffusion policies model a time-varying action\ndenoising process, whose temporal complexity increases the difficulty of model\ntraining and leads to suboptimal action accuracy. To generate robot actions\nefficiently and accurately, we present the Time-Unified Diffusion Policy\n(TUDP), which utilizes action recognition capabilities to build a time-unified\ndenoising process. On the one hand, we build a time-unified velocity field in\naction space with additional action discrimination information. By unifying all\ntimesteps of action denoising, our velocity field reduces the difficulty of\npolicy learning and speeds up action generation. On the other hand, we propose\nan action-wise training method, which introduces an action discrimination\nbranch to supply additional action discrimination information. Through\naction-wise training, the TUDP implicitly learns the ability to discern\nsuccessful actions to better denoising accuracy.

Focusing\non multi-agent task allocation problems, our goal is to study this question\nfrom the perspective of reward design: what kinds of objectives are best suited\nfor heterogeneous teams? We first consider an instantaneous, non-spatial\nsetting where the global reward is built by two generalized aggregation\noperators: an inner operator that maps the $N$ agents' effort allocations on\nindividual tasks to a task score, and an outer operator that merges the $M$\ntask scores into the global team reward. We prove that the curvature of these\noperators determines whether heterogeneity can increase reward, and that for\nbroad reward families this collapses to a simple convexity test. Next, we ask\nwhat incentivizes heterogeneity to emerge when embodied, time-extended agents\nmust learn an effort allocation policy. To study heterogeneity in such\nsettings, we use multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) as our computational\nparadigm, and introduce Heterogeneous Environment Design (HED), a\ngradient-based algorithm that optimizes the parameter space of underspecified\nMARL environments to find scenarios where heterogeneity is advantageous.\nExperiments in matrix games and an embodied Multi-Goal-Capture environment show\nthat, despite the difference in settings, HED rediscovers the reward regimes\npredicted by our theory to maximize the advantage of heterogeneity, both\nvalidating HED and connecting our theoretical insights to reward design in\nMARL.

Recent efforts have\nintroduced Federated Learning (FL) into VLM fine-tuning to address these\nprivacy concerns, yet comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating federated\nfine-tuning strategies, model architectures, and task generalization remain\nlacking. In this work, we present \\textbf{FedVLMBench}, the first systematic\nbenchmark for federated fine-tuning of VLMs. FedVLMBench integrates two\nmainstream VLM architectures (encoder-based and encoder-free), four fine-tuning\nstrategies, five FL algorithms, six multimodal datasets spanning four\ncross-domain single-task scenarios and two cross-domain multitask settings,\ncovering four distinct downstream task categories. Through extensive\nexperiments, we uncover key insights into the interplay between VLM\narchitectures, fine-tuning strategies, data heterogeneity, and multi-task\nfederated optimization. Notably, we find that a 2-layer multilayer perceptron\n(MLP) connector with concurrent connector and LLM tuning emerges as the optimal\nconfiguration for encoder-based VLMs in FL. Furthermore, current FL methods\nexhibit significantly higher sensitivity to data heterogeneity in\nvision-centric tasks than text-centric ones, across both encoder-free and\nencoder-based VLM architectures. Our benchmark provides essential tools,\ndatasets, and empirical guidance for the research community, offering a\nstandardized platform to advance privacy-preserving, federated training of\nmultimodal foundation models."}

Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art restoration methods, achieving significant gains in text\nrecognition accuracy.

Feed-forward scene\nreconstruction has gained significant attention for its ability to rapidly\ncreate digital replicas of real-world environments. However, most existing\nmodels are limited to static scenes and fail to reconstruct the motion of\nmoving objects. Developing a feed-forward model for dynamic scene\nreconstruction poses significant challenges, including the scarcity of training\ndata and the need for appropriate 3D representations and training paradigms. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce several key technical contributions: an\nenhanced large-scale synthetic dataset with ground-truth multi-view videos and\ndense 3D scene flow supervision; a per-pixel deformable 3D Gaussian\nrepresentation that is easy to learn, supports high-quality dynamic view\nsynthesis, and enables long-range 3D tracking; and a large transformer network\nthat achieves real-time, generalizable dynamic scene reconstruction. Extensive\nqualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that DGS-LRM achieves\ndynamic scene reconstruction quality comparable to optimization-based methods,\nwhile significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art predictive dynamic\nreconstruction method on real-world examples. Its predicted physically grounded\n3D deformation is accurate and can readily adapt for long-range 3D tracking\ntasks, achieving performance on par with state-of-the-art monocular video 3D\ntracking methods."}
