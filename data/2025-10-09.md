### [1] [Milestone Determination for Autonomous Railway Operation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06229)
*Josh Hunter,John McDermid,Simon Burton,Poppy Fynes,Mia Dempster*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于里程碑确定的铁路自动化视觉系统，通过路线特定上下文线索生成序列数据集，简化学习过程，专注于关键决策点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决铁路自动化中高质量序列数据稀缺问题，传统数据集缺乏时空上下文，替代方案存在真实性和适用性问题。

Method: 采用里程碑确定概念，开发基于规则的目标模型，聚焦路线关键决策点，避免动态组件的泛化识别需求。

Result: 生成了丰富、符合真实世界操作逻辑的序列数据集，为受控可预测环境中的视觉代理训练提供了实用框架。

Conclusion: 该方法为铁路自动化机器学习系统提供了更安全高效的训练框架，通过专注关键决策点简化学习过程。

Abstract: In the field of railway automation, one of the key challenges has been the
development of effective computer vision systems due to the limited
availability of high-quality, sequential data. Traditional datasets are
restricted in scope, lacking the spatio temporal context necessary for
real-time decision-making, while alternative solutions introduce issues related
to realism and applicability. By focusing on route-specific, contextually
relevant cues, we can generate rich, sequential datasets that align more
closely with real-world operational logic. The concept of milestone
determination allows for the development of targeted, rule-based models that
simplify the learning process by eliminating the need for generalized
recognition of dynamic components, focusing instead on the critical decision
points along a route. We argue that this approach provides a practical
framework for training vision agents in controlled, predictable environments,
facilitating safer and more efficient machine learning systems for railway
automation.

### [2] [CML-Bench: A Framework for Evaluating and Enhancing LLM-Powered Movie Scripts Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06231)
*Mingzhe Zheng,Dingjie Song,Guanyu Zhou,Jun You,Jiahao Zhan,Xuran Ma,Xinyuan Song,Ser-Nam Lim,Qifeng Chen,Harry Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了LLMs在生成高质量电影剧本方面的局限性，提出了CML-Bench评估基准和CML-Instruction提示策略来提升剧本生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLMs能够生成结构化的文本，但在电影剧本创作中缺乏情感深度和叙事灵魂，需要专门的评估和改进方法。

Method: 构建CML-Dataset数据集，分析剧本的多镜头连续性和叙事结构，提出三个评估维度(DC、CC、PR)，开发CML-Bench基准和CML-Instruction提示策略。

Result: CML-Bench能有效区分人类编写和LLM生成的剧本质量，CML-Instruction指导的LLMs能生成更高质量的剧本，结果与人类偏好一致。

Conclusion: 该研究为评估和改进LLMs的电影剧本生成能力提供了有效工具，证明了结构化指导策略的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
generating highly structured texts. However, while exhibiting a high degree of
structural organization, movie scripts demand an additional layer of nuanced
storytelling and emotional depth-the 'soul' of compelling cinema-that LLMs
often fail to capture. To investigate this deficiency, we first curated
CML-Dataset, a dataset comprising (summary, content) pairs for Cinematic Markup
Language (CML), where 'content' consists of segments from esteemed,
high-quality movie scripts and 'summary' is a concise description of the
content. Through an in-depth analysis of the intrinsic multi-shot continuity
and narrative structures within these authentic scripts, we identified three
pivotal dimensions for quality assessment: Dialogue Coherence (DC), Character
Consistency (CC), and Plot Reasonableness (PR). Informed by these findings, we
propose the CML-Bench, featuring quantitative metrics across these dimensions.
CML-Bench effectively assigns high scores to well-crafted, human-written
scripts while concurrently pinpointing the weaknesses in screenplays generated
by LLMs. To further validate our benchmark, we introduce CML-Instruction, a
prompting strategy with detailed instructions on character dialogue and event
logic, to guide LLMs to generate more structured and cinematically sound
scripts. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our benchmark and
demonstrate that LLMs guided by CML-Instruction generate higher-quality
screenplays, with results aligned with human preferences.

### [3] [User to Video: A Model for Spammer Detection Inspired by Video Classification Technology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06233)
*Haoyang Zhang,Zhou Yang,Yucai Pang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于用户视频化的垃圾信息发送者检测模型UVSD，将用户行为子空间视为视频帧，通过视频分类技术识别垃圾信息发送者


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受视频分类技术启发，将用户行为子空间视为帧图像，连续帧图像视为视频，从而检测垃圾信息发送者

Method: 1. 用户像素化算法(user2piexl)：将用户视为像素，立场量化为RGB值；2. 行为图像化算法(behavior2image)：使用表示学习进行低秩密集向量化，结合切割和扩散算法完成帧图像化；3. 基于时间特征构建用户行为视频，结合视频分类算法识别垃圾信息发送者

Result: 在公开数据集WEIBO和TWITTER上的实验表明，UVSD模型优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: UVSD模型通过将用户行为视频化的创新方法，在垃圾信息发送者检测方面表现出色

Abstract: This article is inspired by video classification technology. If the user
behavior subspace is viewed as a frame image, consecutive frame images are
viewed as a video. Following this novel idea, a model for spammer detection
based on user videoization, called UVSD, is proposed. Firstly, a user2piexl
algorithm for user pixelization is proposed. Considering the adversarial
behavior of user stances, the user is viewed as a pixel, and the stance is
quantified as the pixel's RGB. Secondly, a behavior2image algorithm is proposed
for transforming user behavior subspace into frame images. Low-rank dense
vectorization of subspace user relations is performed using representation
learning, while cutting and diffusion algorithms are introduced to complete the
frame imageization. Finally, user behavior videos are constructed based on
temporal features. Subsequently, a video classification algorithm is combined
to identify the spammers. Experiments using publicly available datasets, i.e.,
WEIBO and TWITTER, show an advantage of the UVSD model over state-of-the-art
methods.

### [4] [Uncertainty Quantification In Surface Landmines and UXO Classification Using MC Dropout](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06238)
*Sagar Lekhak,Emmett J. Ientilucci,Dimah Dera,Susmita Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究将蒙特卡洛Dropout集成到微调的ResNet-50架构中，用于地表地雷和未爆弹药分类，通过不确定性量化提高预测可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确定性神经网络在嘈杂条件和对抗性攻击下容易出错，可能导致漏检或误分类，这在人道主义排雷中具有严重风险。

Method: 使用蒙特卡洛Dropout方法集成到微调的ResNet-50架构中，在模拟数据集上进行测试，量化认知不确定性。

Result: 在干净、对抗性扰动和嘈杂测试图像上的实验结果表明，该模型能够在挑战性条件下标记不可靠预测。

Conclusion: 该概念验证研究强调了排雷中不确定性量化的重要性，提高了对现有神经网络在排雷中对抗性威胁脆弱性的认识，并强调了开发更稳健可靠模型的重要性。

Abstract: Detecting surface landmines and unexploded ordnances (UXOs) using deep
learning has shown promise in humanitarian demining. However, deterministic
neural networks can be vulnerable to noisy conditions and adversarial attacks,
leading to missed detection or misclassification. This study introduces the
idea of uncertainty quantification through Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout, integrated
into a fine-tuned ResNet-50 architecture for surface landmine and UXO
classification, which was tested on a simulated dataset. Integrating the MC
Dropout approach helps quantify epistemic uncertainty, providing an additional
metric for prediction reliability, which could be helpful to make more informed
decisions in demining operations. Experimental results on clean, adversarially
perturbed, and noisy test images demonstrate the model's ability to flag
unreliable predictions under challenging conditions. This proof-of-concept
study highlights the need for uncertainty quantification in demining, raises
awareness about the vulnerability of existing neural networks in demining to
adversarial threats, and emphasizes the importance of developing more robust
and reliable models for practical applications.

### [5] [multimodars: A Rust-powered toolkit for multi-modality cardiac image fusion and registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06241)
*Anselm W. Stark,Marc Ilic,Ali Mokhtari,Pooya Mohammadi Kazaj,Christoph Graeni,Isaac Shiri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: multimodars是一个用于多模态冠状动脉成像融合的开源工具包，专门针对多状态分析（静息/应激、支架植入前后）设计，提供确定性对齐算法和高性能处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合互补成像模式对构建可靠的3D冠状动脉模型至关重要：血管内成像提供亚毫米分辨率但缺乏整体血管上下文，而CCTA提供3D几何但存在空间分辨率限制和伪影。现有方法缺乏针对多状态分析的开放、灵活工具包。

Method: 开发multimodars工具包，包含确定性对齐算法、紧凑的NumPy中心数据模型，以及优化的Rust后端，支持CSV/NumPy输入和AIVUS-CAA软件数据格式。

Result: 该工具包实现了可扩展、可重复的实验，提供确定性行为、高性能和易于管道集成的特性。

Conclusion: multimodars填补了多模态冠状动脉成像融合领域的空白，为多状态分析提供了专门的开放工具包解决方案。

Abstract: Combining complementary imaging modalities is critical to build reliable 3D
coronary models: intravascular imaging gives sub-millimetre resolution but
limited whole-vessel context, while CCTA supplies 3D geometry but suffers from
limited spatial resolution and artefacts (e.g., blooming). Prior work
demonstrated intravascular/CCTA fusion, yet no open, flexible toolkit is
tailored for multi-state analysis (rest/stress, pre-/post-stenting) while
offering deterministic behaviour, high performance, and easy pipeline
integration. multimodars addresses this gap with deterministic alignment
algorithms, a compact NumPy-centred data model, and an optimised Rust backend
suitable for scalable, reproducible experiments. The package accepts CSV/NumPy
inputs including data formats produced by the AIVUS-CAA software

### [6] [Does Physics Knowledge Emerge in Frontier Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06251)
*Ieva Bagdonaviciute,Vibhav Vineet*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 评估前沿视觉语言模型在物理动态理解方面的能力，发现其感知能力和物理推理能力之间存在脱节，无法有效结合形成因果理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试视觉语言模型在物理动态理解和预测方面的能力，探究其感知与物理推理技能的结合程度。

Method: 在三个物理模拟数据集（CLEVRER、Physion、Physion++）上评估六个前沿VLM，设计诊断子测试分离感知和物理推理能力。

Result: 模型在感知或物理推理方面的优势与整体评估准确性之间相关性较弱，表明当前VLM存在感知与推理技能碎片化的问题。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型的感知和物理推理能力未能有效结合，需要开发能更紧密绑定感知与推理的架构。

Abstract: Leading Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show strong results in visual
perception and general reasoning, but their ability to understand and predict
physical dynamics remains unclear. We benchmark six frontier VLMs on three
physical simulation datasets - CLEVRER, Physion, and Physion++ - where the
evaluation tasks test whether a model can predict outcomes or hypothesize about
alternative situations. To probe deeper, we design diagnostic subtests that
isolate perception (objects, colors, occluders) from physics reasoning (motion
prediction, spatial relations). Intuitively, stronger diagnostic performance
should support higher evaluation accuracy. Yet our analysis reveals weak
correlations: models that excel at perception or physics reasoning do not
consistently perform better on predictive or counterfactual evaluation. This
counterintuitive gap exposes a central limitation of current VLMs: perceptual
and physics skills remain fragmented and fail to combine into causal
understanding, underscoring the need for architectures that bind perception and
reasoning more tightly.

### [7] [Enhanced Self-Distillation Framework for Efficient Spiking Neural Network Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06254)
*Xiaochen Zhao,Chengting Yu,Kairong Yu,Lei Liu,Aili Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种增强的自蒸馏框架，结合基于速率的反向传播，用于高效训练脉冲神经网络(SNN)，在降低计算复杂度的同时实现高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SNN训练方法在性能和计算效率上落后于人工神经网络(ANN)，且计算和内存开销随时序维度线性增长，限制了在有限计算资源下的高性能训练。

Method: 将中间SNN层的发放率投影到轻量级ANN分支，使用模型自身生成的高质量知识通过ANN路径优化子结构，并分离教师信号为可靠和不可靠组件，仅使用可靠知识指导优化。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、CIFAR10-DVS和ImageNet上的广泛实验表明，该方法在降低训练复杂度的同时实现了高性能SNN训练。

Conclusion: 所提出的增强自蒸馏框架有效解决了SNN训练中的计算效率和性能问题，为资源受限环境下的高性能SNN训练提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) exhibit exceptional energy efficiency on
neuromorphic hardware due to their sparse activation patterns. However,
conventional training methods based on surrogate gradients and Backpropagation
Through Time (BPTT) not only lag behind Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in
performance, but also incur significant computational and memory overheads that
grow linearly with the temporal dimension. To enable high-performance SNN
training under limited computational resources, we propose an enhanced
self-distillation framework, jointly optimized with rate-based backpropagation.
Specifically, the firing rates of intermediate SNN layers are projected onto
lightweight ANN branches, and high-quality knowledge generated by the model
itself is used to optimize substructures through the ANN pathways. Unlike
traditional self-distillation paradigms, we observe that low-quality
self-generated knowledge may hinder convergence. To address this, we decouple
the teacher signal into reliable and unreliable components, ensuring that only
reliable knowledge is used to guide the optimization of the model. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CIFAR10-DVS, and ImageNet demonstrate that
our method reduces training complexity while achieving high-performance SNN
training. Our code is available at

### [8] [Ensemble Deep Learning and LLM-Assisted Reporting for Automated Skin Lesion Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06260)
*Sher Khan,Raz Muhammad,Adil Hussain,Muhammad Sajjad,Muhammad Rashid*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个统一的AI框架用于皮肤科诊断，通过异构神经网络集成和语言模型集成，提高诊断可靠性并改善医患沟通。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前皮肤癌诊断中观察者间变异性和可及性差异的问题，克服现有AI系统的同质化架构、数据集偏见以及将自然语言处理作为事后解释而非临床决策组成部分的局限性。

Method: 1) 使用架构多样的卷积神经网络异构集成，提供互补诊断视角，并包含不确定性机制标记不一致病例；2) 将大语言模型能力直接嵌入诊断工作流，将分类输出转化为临床有意义的评估。

Result: 开发了一个无缝集成的系统，生成结构化报告，包含精确的病变特征描述、可理解的诊断推理和可操作的监测指导，赋能患者在就诊间隔期间识别早期预警信号。

Conclusion: 该框架通过同时解决诊断可靠性和沟通障碍，弥合了阻碍先前AI实现临床影响的关键转化差距，代表了可部署皮肤科AI的重要进展，提高了诊断精度并支持从初始检测到患者教育的连续护理。

Abstract: Cutaneous malignancies demand early detection for favorable outcomes, yet
current diagnostics suffer from inter-observer variability and access
disparities. While AI shows promise, existing dermatological systems are
limited by homogeneous architectures, dataset biases across skin tones, and
fragmented approaches that treat natural language processing as separate
post-hoc explanations rather than integral to clinical decision-making. We
introduce a unified framework that fundamentally reimagines AI integration for
dermatological diagnostics through two synergistic innovations. First, a
purposefully heterogeneous ensemble of architecturally diverse convolutional
neural networks provides complementary diagnostic perspectives, with an
intrinsic uncertainty mechanism flagging discordant cases for specialist review
-- mimicking clinical best practices. Second, we embed large language model
capabilities directly into the diagnostic workflow, transforming classification
outputs into clinically meaningful assessments that simultaneously fulfill
medical documentation requirements and deliver patient-centered education. This
seamless integration generates structured reports featuring precise lesion
characterization, accessible diagnostic reasoning, and actionable monitoring
guidance -- empowering patients to recognize early warning signs between
visits. By addressing both diagnostic reliability and communication barriers
within a single cohesive system, our approach bridges the critical
translational gap that has prevented previous AI implementations from achieving
clinical impact. The framework represents a significant advancement toward
deployable dermatological AI that enhances diagnostic precision while actively
supporting the continuum of care from initial detection through patient
education, ultimately improving early intervention rates for skin lesions.

### [9] [Vision Transformer for Transient Noise Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06273)
*Divyansh Srivastava,Andrzej Niedzielski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用Vision Transformer模型对LIGO数据中的瞬态噪声进行分类，将22个现有类别和O3a运行中的2个新噪声类别进行有效分类，达到92.26%的分类效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LIGO数据中的瞬态噪声（毛刺）会阻碍引力波的探测，随着O3运行增加了两个新的噪声类别，需要训练新模型进行有效分类。

Method: 在结合了Gravity Spy数据集和LIGO O3a运行中两个新增类别的组合数据集上，训练预训练的Vision Transformer（ViT-B/32）模型。

Result: 实现了92.26%的分类效率，证明了Vision Transformer在有效区分瞬态噪声方面的潜力。

Conclusion: Vision Transformer模型能够提高引力波探测的准确性，通过有效区分瞬态噪声来改善引力波检测。

Abstract: Transient noise (glitches) in LIGO data hinders the detection of
gravitational waves (GW). The Gravity Spy project has categorized these noise
events into various classes. With the O3 run, there is the inclusion of two
additional noise classes and thus a need to train new models for effective
classification. We aim to classify glitches in LIGO data into 22 existing
classes from the first run plus 2 additional noise classes from O3a using the
Vision Transformer (ViT) model. We train a pre-trained Vision Transformer
(ViT-B/32) model on a combined dataset consisting of the Gravity Spy dataset
with the additional two classes from the LIGO O3a run. We achieve a
classification efficiency of 92.26%, demonstrating the potential of Vision
Transformer to improve the accuracy of gravitational wave detection by
effectively distinguishing transient noise.
  Key words: gravitational waves --vision transformer --machine learning

*Fahim Shahriar,Cheryl Wang,Alireza Azimi,Gautham Vasan,Hany Hamed Elanwar,A. Rupam Mahmood,Colin Bellinger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于掩码的目标表示方法，通过对象无关的视觉线索实现高效学习和优越泛化，解决了现有目标表示方法的泛化差、收敛慢等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标条件强化学习(GCRL)的成功依赖于目标表示的选择，现有方法如目标状态图像、3D坐标和one-hot向量存在泛化能力差、收敛速度慢、需要特殊摄像头等问题。

Method: 使用掩码作为目标表示系统，提供对象无关的视觉线索，可以处理生成密集奖励而无需易出错的距离计算。在仿真中使用真实掩码学习，并利用预训练的开词汇对象检测模型进行掩码生成。

Result: 在训练和未见测试对象上达到99.9%的到达准确率，能够高精度执行拾取任务而无需使用目标的位置信息。在两个不同的物理机器人上展示了从零开始学习和仿真到现实的迁移应用。

Conclusion: 掩码目标表示方法在GCRL中表现出高效学习和优越泛化能力，能够成功应用于实际机器人任务，包括从零学习和仿真到现实的迁移。

Abstract: Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) allows agents to learn diverse
objectives using a unified policy. The success of GCRL, however, is contingent
on the choice of goal representation. In this work, we propose a mask-based
goal representation system that provides object-agnostic visual cues to the
agent, enabling efficient learning and superior generalization. In contrast,
existing goal representation methods, such as target state images, 3D
coordinates, and one-hot vectors, face issues of poor generalization to unseen
objects, slow convergence, and the need for special cameras. Masks can be
processed to generate dense rewards without requiring error-prone distance
calculations. Learning with ground truth masks in simulation, we achieved 99.9%
reaching accuracy on training and unseen test objects. Our proposed method can
be utilized to perform pick-up tasks with high accuracy, without using any
positional information of the target. Moreover, we demonstrate learning from
scratch and sim-to-real transfer applications using two different physical
robots, utilizing pretrained open vocabulary object detection models for mask
generation.

### [11] [Improving the Spatial Resolution of GONG Solar Images to GST Quality Using Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06281)
*Chenyang Li,Qin Li,Haimin Wang,Bo Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于GAN的超分辨率方法，将GONG的低分辨率Hα太阳图像增强至接近BBSO/GST高分辨率观测的质量，有效恢复太阳黑子半影和细丝结构的细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全盘Hα太阳图像的空间分辨率有限，无法解析细丝和纤维等小尺度动态特征，需要提升图像分辨率以更好地研究这些精细结构。

Method: 使用Real-ESRGAN模型，结合残差中的残差密集块和相对判别器，对GONG低分辨率图像进行超分辨率重建。

Result: 模型成功恢复了太阳黑子半影内的精细细节，并解析了细丝和纤维结构，平均MSE为467.15，RMSE为21.59，交叉相关性为0.7794。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了太阳图像分辨率，但图像对之间的轻微错位限制了定量性能，未来将通过数据集扩展和错位问题解决来进一步提高重建质量。

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) solar imaging is crucial for capturing fine-scale
dynamic features such as filaments and fibrils. However, the spatial resolution
of the full-disk H$\alpha$ images is limited and insufficient to resolve these
small-scale structures. To address this, we propose a GAN-based superresolution
approach to enhance low-resolution (LR) full-disk H$\alpha$ images from the
Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) to a quality comparable with HR
observations from the Big Bear Solar Observatory/Goode Solar Telescope
(BBSO/GST). We employ Real-ESRGAN with Residual-in-Residual Dense Blocks and a
relativistic discriminator. We carefully aligned GONG-GST pairs. The model
effectively recovers fine details within sunspot penumbrae and resolves fine
details in filaments and fibrils, achieving an average mean squared error (MSE)
of 467.15, root mean squared error (RMSE) of 21.59, and cross-correlation (CC)
of 0.7794. Slight misalignments between image pairs limit quantitative
performance, which we plan to address in future work alongside dataset
expansion to further improve reconstruction quality.

### [12] [ChainMPQ: Interleaved Text-Image Reasoning Chains for Mitigating Relation Hallucinations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06292)
*Yike Wu,Yiwei Wang,Yujun Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ChainMPQ是一种无需训练的方法，通过多视角问题和图像-文本交错链来减少大型视觉语言模型中的关系幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在关系类别上的幻觉问题最为严重但研究最少，需要专门解决关系推理的可靠性问题。

Method: 提取主客体关键词增强图像区域，构建关注主体、客体和关系的多视角问题，通过交错链式推理利用累积的文本和视觉记忆。

Result: 在多个LVLM和基准测试中，ChainMPQ显著减少了关系幻觉，消融研究验证了其三个核心模块的有效性。

Conclusion: ChainMPQ通过多视角问题和交错链式推理有效提升了LVLM的关系推理能力，为解决关系幻觉问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve strong performance in
multimodal tasks, hallucinations continue to hinder their reliability. Among
the three categories of hallucinations, which include object, attribute, and
relation, relation hallucinations account for the largest proportion but have
received the least attention. To address this issue, we propose ChainMPQ
(Multi-Perspective Questions guided Interleaved Chain of Image and Text), a
training-free method that improves relational inference in LVLMs by utilizing
accumulated textual and visual memories. ChainMPQ first extracts subject and
object keywords from the question to enhance the corresponding image regions.
It then constructs multi-perspective questions that focus on the three core
components of a relationship: the subject, the object, and the relation that
links them. These questions are sequentially input to the model, with textual
and visual memories from earlier steps providing supporting context for
subsequent ones, thereby forming an interleaved chain of images and text that
guides progressive relational reasoning. Experiments on multiple LVLMs and
benchmarks show that ChainMPQ substantially reduces relation hallucinations,
while ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of its three core
modules.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MobilePicasso是一个高效的高分辨率图像编辑系统，通过三阶段方法在移动设备上实现4K图像编辑，显著降低计算成本和内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在资源受限设备上进行高分辨率图像编辑时面临内存和图像质量的挑战，需要开发高效的移动端解决方案。

Method: 系统包含三个阶段：(i) 使用幻觉感知损失在标准分辨率下进行图像编辑；(ii) 应用潜在投影避免进入像素空间；(iii) 通过自适应上下文保持分块将编辑后的图像潜在表示上采样到更高分辨率。

Result: 用户研究表明，MobilePicasso比现有方法提高图像质量18-48%，减少幻觉14-51%，实现高达55.8倍的加速，仅增加9%的运行内存，在设备上的运行速度甚至快于A100 GPU上的服务器模型。

Conclusion: MobilePicasso成功解决了移动设备上高分辨率图像编辑的挑战，在保持高质量的同时显著提升了效率。

Abstract: High-resolution (4K) image-to-image synthesis has become increasingly
important for mobile applications. Existing diffusion models for image editing
face significant challenges, in terms of memory and image quality, when
deployed on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present
MobilePicasso, a novel system that enables efficient image editing at high
resolutions, while minimising computational cost and memory usage.
MobilePicasso comprises three stages: (i) performing image editing at a
standard resolution with hallucination-aware loss, (ii) applying latent
projection to overcome going to the pixel space, and (iii) upscaling the edited
image latent to a higher resolution with adaptive context-preserving tiling.
Our user study with 46 participants reveals that MobilePicasso not only
improves image quality by 18-48% but reduces hallucinations by 14-51% over
existing methods. MobilePicasso demonstrates significantly lower latency, e.g.,
up to 55.8$\times$ speed-up, yet with a small increase in runtime memory, e.g.,
a mere 9% increase over prior work. Surprisingly, the on-device runtime of
MobilePicasso is observed to be faster than a server-based high-resolution
image editing model running on an A100 GPU.

### [14] [RGBD Gaze Tracking Using Transformer for Feature Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06298)
*Tobias J. Bauer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 实现基于RGBD图像的AI视线追踪系统，使用Transformer架构融合RGB和深度特征，创建新数据集，在三个数据集上评估模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合RGBD输入图像和Transformer架构进行视线追踪的研究尚未被探索，现有数据集缺乏深度信息或标签不适合视线角度估计任务。

Method: 基于Lian等人的GAN架构，使用Transformer模块融合RGB和深度特征，创建新数据集，训练多种模型配置并在三个数据集上验证。

Result: 在ShanghaiTechGaze+数据集上，带Transformer模块的模型平均欧几里得误差为55.3mm，无预训练GAN模块时降至30.1mm，用MLP替代Transformer后进一步降至26.9mm。在ETH-XGaze数据集上，带Transformer模块的平均角度误差为3.59°，无Transformer为3.26°。

Conclusion: Transformer模块在视线追踪任务中表现不如预期，使用MLP替代Transformer或移除预训练GAN模块能获得更好的性能，但相比现有最佳方法仍有差距。

Abstract: Subject of this thesis is the implementation of an AI-based Gaze Tracking
system using RGBD images that contain both color (RGB) and depth (D)
information. To fuse the features extracted from the images, a module based on
the Transformer architecture is used. The combination of RGBD input images and
Transformers was chosen because it has not yet been investigated. Furthermore,
a new dataset is created for training the AI models as existing datasets either
do not contain depth information or only contain labels for Gaze Point
Estimation that are not suitable for the task of Gaze Angle Estimation. Various
model configurations are trained, validated and evaluated on a total of three
different datasets. The trained models are then to be used in a real-time
pipeline to estimate the gaze direction and thus the gaze point of a person in
front of a computer screen. The AI model architecture used in this thesis is
based on an earlier work by Lian et al. It uses a Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) to simultaneously remove depth map artifacts and extract head
pose features. Lian et al. achieve a mean Euclidean error of 38.7mm on their
own dataset ShanghaiTechGaze+. In this thesis, a model architecture with a
Transformer module for feature fusion achieves a mean Euclidean error of 55.3mm

*Tiago de Conto,John Armston,Ralph Dubayah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种融合GEDI激光雷达和SAR数据的深度学习框架，用于生成全球25米分辨率的森林结构复杂度地图，实现了高精度预测和不确定性校准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GEDI激光雷达数据采样稀疏，限制了连续高分辨率森林结构复杂度制图的需求，需要开发可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 采用改进的EfficientNetV2架构，融合GEDI观测和多模式SAR数据集，训练超过1.3亿个GEDI足迹，参数量少于40万。

Result: 模型达到全球R²=0.82的高性能，能够准确预测不同生物群落和时间段的森林结构复杂度，保持精细空间模式。

Conclusion: 该框架支持全球森林结构动态的连续多时相监测，为生物多样性保护和生态系统管理提供工具，并可通过迁移学习扩展到其他森林结构变量预测。

Abstract: Forest structural complexity metrics integrate multiple canopy attributes
into a single value that reflects habitat quality and ecosystem function.
Spaceborne lidar from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) has
enabled mapping of structural complexity in temperate and tropical forests, but
its sparse sampling limits continuous high-resolution mapping. We present a
scalable, deep learning framework fusing GEDI observations with multimodal
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) datasets to produce global, high-resolution (25
m) wall-to-wall maps of forest structural complexity. Our adapted
EfficientNetV2 architecture, trained on over 130 million GEDI footprints,
achieves high performance (global R2 = 0.82) with fewer than 400,000
parameters, making it an accessible tool that enables researchers to process
datasets at any scale without requiring specialized computing infrastructure.
The model produces accurate predictions with calibrated uncertainty estimates
across biomes and time periods, preserving fine-scale spatial patterns. It has
been used to generate a global, multi-temporal dataset of forest structural
complexity from 2015 to 2022. Through transfer learning, this framework can be
extended to predict additional forest structural variables with minimal
computational cost. This approach supports continuous, multi-temporal
monitoring of global forest structural dynamics and provides tools for
biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management efforts in a changing
climate.

*Allen Tu,Kartik Narayan,Joshua Gleason,Jennifer Xu,Matthew Meyn,Tom Goldstein,Vishal M. Patel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TransFIRA是一个轻量级、无需标注的人脸图像可识别性评估框架，通过嵌入空间中的类中心相似度和类中心角度分离来定义可识别性，实现了最先进的验证精度和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在无约束环境中人脸识别面临的姿态、模糊、光照和遮挡等极端变化问题，传统视觉质量指标无法预测输入是否真正可被编码器识别。

Method: 使用类中心相似度(CCS)和类中心角度分离(CCAS)定义可识别性，提出可识别性感知的聚合策略，无需外部标签、启发式方法或骨干网络特定训练。

Result: 在BRIAR和IJB-C数据集上达到最先进的验证精度，与真实可识别性的相关性几乎翻倍，在身体识别上也表现强劲，对跨数据集偏移具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TransFIRA作为一个统一的、几何驱动的可识别性评估框架，在准确性、可解释性和跨模态扩展性方面显著推进了FIQA领域。

Abstract: Face recognition in unconstrained environments such as surveillance, video,
and web imagery must contend with extreme variation in pose, blur,
illumination, and occlusion, where conventional visual quality metrics fail to
predict whether inputs are truly recognizable to the deployed encoder. Existing
FIQA methods typically rely on visual heuristics, curated annotations, or
computationally intensive generative pipelines, leaving their predictions
detached from the encoder's decision geometry. We introduce TransFIRA (Transfer
Learning for Face Image Recognizability Assessment), a lightweight and
annotation-free framework that grounds recognizability directly in embedding
space. TransFIRA delivers three advances: (i) a definition of recognizability
via class-center similarity (CCS) and class-center angular separation (CCAS),
yielding the first natural, decision-boundary--aligned criterion for filtering
and weighting; (ii) a recognizability-informed aggregation strategy that
achieves state-of-the-art verification accuracy on BRIAR and IJB-C while nearly
doubling correlation with true recognizability, all without external labels,
heuristics, or backbone-specific training; and (iii) new extensions beyond
faces, including encoder-grounded explainability that reveals how degradations
and subject-specific factors affect recognizability, and the first
recognizability-aware body recognition assessment. Experiments confirm
state-of-the-art results on faces, strong performance on body recognition, and
robustness under cross-dataset shifts. Together, these contributions establish
TransFIRA as a unified, geometry-driven framework for recognizability
assessment -- encoder-specific, accurate, interpretable, and extensible across
modalities -- significantly advancing FIQA in accuracy, explainability, and
scope.

TL;DR: 纽约州交通部使用机器学习和天气数据自动分类道路表面状况，在完全未见过的摄像头上达到81.5%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纽约州交通部目前通过人工驾驶和观察实时摄像头来评估道路状况，这些任务劳动密集但在冬季天气事件中至关重要。机器学习模型可以为NYSDOT提供额外支持，自动分类全州当前道路状况。

Method: 使用卷积神经网络和随机森林在摄像头图像和天气数据上进行训练，数据集包含约22,000张人工标记的图像，分为六种道路表面状况：严重积雪、积雪、潮湿、干燥、能见度差或被遮挡。

Result: 模型在完全未见过的摄像头上实现了81.5%的准确率，优先考虑了模型的泛化能力以满足NYSDOT决策者的操作需求。

Conclusion: 机器学习模型能够有效支持NYSDOT自动评估道路状况，特别是在冬季天气事件中为关键运营决策提供帮助。

Abstract: The New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) has a network of
roadside traffic cameras that are used by both the NYSDOT and the public to
observe road conditions. The NYSDOT evaluates road conditions by driving on
roads and observing live cameras, tasks which are labor-intensive but necessary
for making critical operational decisions during winter weather events.
However, machine learning models can provide additional support for the NYSDOT
by automatically classifying current road conditions across the state. In this
study, convolutional neural networks and random forests are trained on camera
images and weather data to predict road surface conditions. Models are trained
on a hand-labeled dataset of ~22,000 camera images, each classified by human
labelers into one of six road surface conditions: severe snow, snow, wet, dry,
poor visibility, or obstructed. Model generalizability is prioritized to meet
the operational needs of the NYSDOT decision makers, and the weather-related
road surface condition model in this study achieves an accuracy of 81.5% on
completely unseen cameras.

Motivation: 低成本热成像相机存在低分辨率、固定模式噪声等局部退化问题，且现有热成像数据集在规模和多样性方面都很有限。

Method: 采用基于补丁的扩散框架，在小热图像补丁上训练，通过去噪重叠补丁并使用平滑空间窗口进行融合来恢复全分辨率图像。

Result: 在去噪、超分辨率和去模糊任务上的实验表明，该方法在模拟和真实热数据上都取得了强劲结果。

Conclusion: 这是首个基于补丁的扩散框架，为多个热图像恢复任务建立了学习的先验模型，可作为统一的恢复流程。

Abstract: Thermal images from low-cost cameras often suffer from low resolution, fixed
pattern noise, and other localized degradations. Available datasets for thermal
imaging are also limited in both size and diversity. To address these
challenges, we propose a patch-based diffusion framework (TDiff) that leverages
the local nature of these distortions by training on small thermal patches. In
this approach, full-resolution images are restored by denoising overlapping
patches and blending them using smooth spatial windowing. To our knowledge,
this is the first patch-based diffusion framework that models a learned prior
for thermal image restoration across multiple tasks. Experiments on denoising,
super-resolution, and deblurring demonstrate strong results on both simulated
and real thermal data, establishing our method as a unified restoration
pipeline.

Motivation: 现有方法在多主体身份保持生成方面存在局限，需要开发一个能够同时处理结构和空间约束的统一框架，支持不同精度的用户指导。

Method: 提出了SIGMA-GEN框架，引入SIGMA-SET27K合成数据集，该数据集包含27k图像中超过100k独特主体的身份、结构和空间信息。

Conclusion: SIGMA-GEN是一个高效的多身份保持图像生成框架，能够通过单一模型支持不同精度的用户指导，在多个指标上表现优异。

Abstract: We present SIGMA-GEN, a unified framework for multi-identity preserving image
generation. Unlike prior approaches, SIGMA-GEN is the first to enable
single-pass multi-subject identity-preserved generation guided by both
structural and spatial constraints. A key strength of our method is its ability
to support user guidance at various levels of precision -- from coarse 2D or 3D
boxes to pixel-level segmentations and depth -- with a single model. To enable
this, we introduce SIGMA-SET27K, a novel synthetic dataset that provides
identity, structure, and spatial information for over 100k unique subjects

TL;DR: 提出SIGRID（超像素集成网格）数据结构，在分割任务中替代全分辨率图像，通过结合颜色和形状信息压缩数据维度，在保持精度的同时显著加速训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超像素虽然能简化图像处理，但其不规则分布使深度学习需要特殊架构，违背了简化初衷。

Method: 利用经典形状描述符编码超像素的颜色和形状信息，构建SIGRID数据结构，大幅降低输入维度。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上测试，使用两种卷积分割架构，SIGRID不仅匹配甚至在某些情况下超越像素级表示的性能，同时显著加速模型训练。

Conclusion: SIGRID在准确性和计算效率之间实现了有利的平衡，是有效的图像分割数据表示方法。

Abstract: Superpixels have long been used in image simplification to enable more
efficient data processing and storage. However, despite their computational
potential, their irregular spatial distribution has often forced deep learning
approaches to rely on specialized training algorithms and architectures,
undermining the original motivation for superpixelations. In this work, we
introduce a new superpixel-based data structure, SIGRID (Superpixel-Integrated
Grid), as an alternative to full-resolution images in segmentation tasks. By
leveraging classical shape descriptors, SIGRID encodes both color and shape
information of superpixels while substantially reducing input dimensionality.
We evaluate SIGRIDs on four benchmark datasets using two popular convolutional
segmentation architectures. Our results show that, despite compressing the
original data, SIGRIDs not only match but in some cases surpass the performance
of pixel-level representations, all while significantly accelerating model
training. This demonstrates that SIGRIDs achieve a favorable balance between
accuracy and computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到人类交互建模面临两个主要限制：1）有限的两人训练数据无法捕捉复杂交互细节；2）文本条件建模过于粗糙，将丰富的结构化提示压缩为单一句子嵌入。

Method: 1. InterCompose：可扩展的合成组合管道，将LLM生成的交互描述与单人运动先验对齐；2. InterActor：具有词级条件的文本到交互模型，保留标记级线索和自适应交互损失。

Result: 广泛实验显示在运动多样性、保真度和泛化能力方面取得一致提升，包括分布外场景和用户研究。

Conclusion: Text2Interact框架通过可扩展的数据合成和有效的时空协调管道，能够生成真实、文本对齐的人类交互，将发布代码和模型以促进可复现性。

Abstract: Modeling human-human interactions from text remains challenging because it
requires not only realistic individual dynamics but also precise,
text-consistent spatiotemporal coupling between agents. Currently, progress is
hindered by 1) limited two-person training data, inadequate to capture the
diverse intricacies of two-person interactions; and 2) insufficiently
fine-grained text-to-interaction modeling, where language conditioning
collapses rich, structured prompts into a single sentence embedding. To address
these limitations, we propose our Text2Interact framework, designed to generate
realistic, text-aligned human-human interactions through a scalable
high-fidelity interaction data synthesizer and an effective spatiotemporal
coordination pipeline. First, we present InterCompose, a scalable
synthesis-by-composition pipeline that aligns LLM-generated interaction
descriptions with strong single-person motion priors. Given a prompt and a
motion for an agent, InterCompose retrieves candidate single-person motions,
trains a conditional reaction generator for another agent, and uses a neural
motion evaluator to filter weak or misaligned samples-expanding interaction
coverage without extra capture. Second, we propose InterActor, a
text-to-interaction model with word-level conditioning that preserves
token-level cues (initiation, response, contact ordering) and an adaptive
interaction loss that emphasizes contextually relevant inter-person joint
pairs, improving coupling and physical plausibility for fine-grained
interaction modeling. Extensive experiments show consistent gains in motion
diversity, fidelity, and generalization, including out-of-distribution
scenarios and user studies. We will release code and models to facilitate
reproducibility.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了KeyScore多模态帧评分框架和STACFP时空自适应聚类方法，通过联合利用字幕和视觉上下文来评估帧的重要性，实现高效的视频-语言理解，相比全帧推理减少99%的帧数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频理解需要选择少量保留语义和上下文信息的帧，传统方法在效率和效果上存在局限。

Method: KeyScore结合语义相似性、时间多样性和上下文影响来评分帧重要性；STACFP为长视频生成紧凑多样的帧候选集。

Result: 在MSRVTT、MSVD和DiDeMo数据集上显著优于标准8帧编码器，实现99%的帧减少。

Conclusion: 强调视觉和文本信号的多模态对齐可实现可扩展、高效且基于字幕的视频理解，无需显式视频摘要。

Abstract: Efficient video-language understanding requires selecting a small set of
frames that retain semantic and contextual information from long videos. We
propose KeyScore, a multimodal frame scoring framework that jointly leverages
captions and visual context to estimate frame-level importance. By combining
semantic similarity, temporal diversity, and contextual drop impact, KeyScore
identifies the most informative frames for downstream tasks such as retrieval,
captioning, and video-language reasoning. To complement KeyScore, we introduce
STACFP (Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Clustering for Frame Proposals), which
generates compact and diverse frame candidates for long-form videos. Together,
these modules achieve up to 99\% frame reduction compared to full-frame
inference and substantially outperform standard 8-frame encoders on MSRVTT,
MSVD, and DiDeMo. Our results demonstrate that emphasizing multimodal alignment
between visual and textual signals enables scalable, efficient, and
caption-grounded video understanding -- without explicit video summarization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将神经模型（如YOLO和HuBERT）在单个帧/音频片段中检测到的局部属性得分提升到时间属性，对下游应用如查询匹配和排序检索很有用。

Method: 提出了LogSTOP评分函数，能够高效计算线性时序逻辑表示的时间属性得分。

Result: 在视频中物体和语音中情感的时间属性查询匹配任务上，LogSTOP比基线方法至少提升16%；在视频中物体和动作的排序检索任务上，平均精度和召回率分别至少提升19%和16%。

Conclusion: LogSTOP能够有效处理序列上的时间属性评分问题，在多个任务上显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Neural models such as YOLO and HuBERT can be used to detect local properties
such as objects ("car") and emotions ("angry") in individual frames of videos
and audio clips respectively. The likelihood of these detections is indicated
by scores in [0, 1]. Lifting these scores to temporal properties over sequences
can be useful for several downstream applications such as query matching (e.g.,
"does the speaker eventually sound happy in this audio clip?"), and ranked
retrieval (e.g., "retrieve top 5 videos with a 10 second scene where a car is
detected until a pedestrian is detected"). In this work, we formalize this
problem of assigning Scores for TempOral Properties (STOPs) over sequences,
given potentially noisy score predictors for local properties. We then propose
a scoring function called LogSTOP that can efficiently compute these scores for
temporal properties represented in Linear Temporal Logic. Empirically, LogSTOP,
with YOLO and HuBERT, outperforms Large Vision / Audio Language Models and
other Temporal Logic-based baselines by at least 16% on query matching with
temporal properties over objects-in-videos and emotions-in-speech respectively.
Similarly, on ranked retrieval with temporal properties over objects and
actions in videos, LogSTOP with Grounding DINO and SlowR50 reports at least a
19% and 16% increase in mean average precision and recall over zero-shot
text-to-video retrieval baselines respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有限角度电子断层扫描存在严重的重建伪影问题，而现有深度学习方法需要大量高质量训练数据，这在电子显微镜中难以获得。

Method: 使用FIB-SEM体积数据训练扩散模型，通过模拟器将其映射到TEM倾斜系列，直接在3D体积上操作以强制执行切片间一致性。

Result: 在模拟电子断层扫描数据集上优于最先进方法，且训练好的模型能泛化到不同条件下的真实TEM数据，甚至在仅8度倾斜范围内也能准确恢复结构。

Conclusion: TEMDiff提供了一种有效的解决方案，能够在无需重新训练的情况下处理真实世界的有限角度电子断层扫描数据。

Abstract: Limited-angle electron tomography aims to reconstruct 3D shapes from 2D
projections of Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) within a restricted range
and number of tilting angles, but it suffers from the missing-wedge problem
that causes severe reconstruction artifacts. Deep learning approaches have
shown promising results in alleviating these artifacts, yet they typically
require large high-quality training datasets with known 3D ground truth which
are difficult to obtain in electron microscopy. To address these challenges, we
propose TEMDiff, a novel 3D diffusion-based iterative reconstruction framework.
Our method is trained on readily available volumetric FIB-SEM data using a
simulator that maps them to TEM tilt series, enabling the model to learn
realistic structural priors without requiring clean TEM ground truth. By
operating directly on 3D volumes, TEMDiff implicitly enforces consistency
across slices without the need for additional regularization. On simulated
electron tomography datasets with limited angular coverage, TEMDiff outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction quality. We further demonstrate that
a trained TEMDiff model generalizes well to real-world TEM tilts obtained under
different conditions and can recover accurate structures from tilt ranges as
narrow as 8 degrees, with 2-degree increments, without any retraining or
fine-tuning.

TL;DR: VUGEN是一个新颖的视觉语言模型框架，通过利用预训练的视觉理解先验来实现高效高质量的图像生成，无需复杂的自动编码器或桥接机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在图像生成方面存在挑战，通常依赖重建导向的自动编码器或复杂的桥接机制，导致理解与生成表示不对齐或架构复杂。

Method: 首先将VLM视觉编码器的高维潜在空间转换为低维可处理分布，然后训练VLM在该降维潜在空间中采样，最后使用专门的像素解码器将生成的潜在映射回图像空间。

Result: VUGEN在图像生成性能上表现优异，将DPG Bench从71.17提升到74.32，COCO上的FID从11.86改善到9.06，同时完全保留了VLM的原始理解能力。

Conclusion: VUGEN框架成功地将视觉语言模型的视觉理解先验用于图像生成，实现了理解与生成能力的统一，且无需复杂的潜在扩散解码器。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled unified
understanding across text and images, yet equipping these models with robust
image generation capabilities remains challenging. Existing approaches often
rely on reconstruction-oriented autoencoders or complex bridging mechanisms,
leading to misalignment between understanding and generation representations,
or architectural complexity. In this work, we propose VUGEN, a novel framework
that explicitly leverages VLM's pretrained visual understanding priors for
efficient and high-quality image generation. Our approach first transforms the
high-dimensional latent space of the VLM's native vision encoder into a
lower-dimensional, tractable distribution that maximally preserves visual
information. The VLM is then trained to sample within this reduced latent
space, ensuring alignment with its visual understanding capabilities. Finally,
a dedicated pixel decoder maps these generated latents back to the image space.
We find that a VAE-free pixel diffusion decoder to be on par or better than
commonly used complex latent diffusion decoders that internally rely on VAE
latents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VUGEN achieves superior image
generation performance, improving DPG Bench from 71.17 to 74.32 and FID from
11.86 to 9.06 on COCO, while fully preserving the VLM's original understanding
capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出cluster paths方法，通过聚类神经网络激活值生成可解释的序列路径，并引入四个评估指标验证其有效性，可识别虚假线索、保持预测忠实度，并能扩展到大型视觉模型作为异常检测器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代深度神经网络在视觉任务中表现出色但决策过程不透明，存在过度信任、未检测偏差和意外失败的风险，需要可解释性方法来理解模型决策。

Method: 在选定层对激活值进行聚类，将每个输入表示为聚类ID序列（cluster paths），并引入路径复杂度、加权路径纯度、决策对齐忠实度和路径一致性四个评估指标。扩展到大型模型时使用概念路径。

Result: 在虚假线索CIFAR-10实验中识别颜色捷径；在CelebA头发颜色任务中达到90%忠实度和96%噪声一致性；可扩展到ImageNet预训练的Vision Transformer；能有效检测分布外样本。

Conclusion: cluster paths方法能够扩展到大型视觉模型，生成简洁且人类可读的解释，揭示多网络深度的视觉概念如调色板、纹理和对象上下文。

Abstract: While modern deep neural networks achieve impressive performance in vision
tasks, they remain opaque in their decision processes, risking unwarranted
trust, undetected biases and unexpected failures. We propose cluster paths, a
post-hoc interpretability method that clusters activations at selected layers
and represents each input as its sequence of cluster IDs. To assess these
cluster paths, we introduce four metrics: path complexity (cognitive load),
weighted-path purity (class alignment), decision-alignment faithfulness
(predictive fidelity), and path agreement (stability under perturbations). In a
spurious-cue CIFAR-10 experiment, cluster paths identify color-based shortcuts
and collapse when the cue is removed. On a five-class CelebA hair-color task,
they achieve 90% faithfulness and maintain 96% agreement under Gaussian noise
without sacrificing accuracy. Scaling to a Vision Transformer pretrained on
ImageNet, we extend cluster paths to concept paths derived from prompting a
large language model on minimal path divergences. Finally, we show that cluster
paths can serve as an effective out-of-distribution (OOD) detector, reliably
flagging anomalous samples before the model generates over-confident
predictions. Cluster paths uncover visual concepts, such as color palettes,
textures, or object contexts, at multiple network depths, demonstrating that
cluster paths scale to large vision models while generating concise and
human-readable explanations.

Abstract: Existing deep learning approaches for image super-resolution, particularly
those based on CNNs and attention mechanisms, often suffer from structural
inflexibility. Although graph-based methods offer greater representational
adaptability, they are frequently impeded by excessive computational
complexity. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes the
Heterogeneous Subgraph Network (HSNet), a novel framework that efficiently
leverages graph modeling while maintaining computational feasibility. The core
idea of HSNet is to decompose the global graph into manageable sub-components.
First, we introduce the Constructive Subgraph Set Block (CSSB), which generates
a diverse set of complementary subgraphs. Rather than relying on a single
monolithic graph, CSSB captures heterogeneous characteristics of the image by
modeling different relational patterns and feature interactions, producing a
rich ensemble of both local and global graph structures. Subsequently, the
Subgraph Aggregation Block (SAB) integrates the representations embedded across
these subgraphs. Through adaptive weighting and fusion of multi-graph features,
SAB constructs a comprehensive and discriminative representation that captures
intricate interdependencies. Furthermore, a Node Sampling Strategy (NSS) is
designed to selectively retain the most salient features, thereby enhancing
accuracy while reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that HSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively
balancing reconstruction quality with computational efficiency. The code will
be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出了一个半自动、不确定性感知的地面激光扫描点云语义分割流程，通过球面投影、特征增强、集成学习和针对性标注来减少标注工作量，同时保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决地面激光扫描点云语义分割中手动标注成本高昂的问题，开发一个高效的半自动标注流程来减少人工标注工作量。

Method: 将3D点投影到2D球面网格，增强多源特征像素，训练分割网络集成生成伪标签和不确定性图，指导标注模糊区域，然后将2D输出反投影到3D。

Result: 性能在约12个标注扫描后达到饱和，几何特征贡献最大，9通道特征堆栈捕获了几乎所有判别能力，mIoU稳定在0.76左右。

Conclusion: 开发了一个稳健的不确定性感知标注流程和Mangrove3D数据集，为生态监测等应用提供了可扩展的高质量点云分割解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate semantic segmentation of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) point
clouds is limited by costly manual annotation. We propose a semi-automated,
uncertainty-aware pipeline that integrates spherical projection, feature
enrichment, ensemble learning, and targeted annotation to reduce labeling
effort, while sustaining high accuracy. Our approach projects 3D points to a 2D
spherical grid, enriches pixels with multi-source features, and trains an
ensemble of segmentation networks to produce pseudo-labels and uncertainty
maps, the latter guiding annotation of ambiguous regions. The 2D outputs are
back-projected to 3D, yielding densely annotated point clouds supported by a
three-tier visualization suite (2D feature maps, 3D colorized point clouds, and
compact virtual spheres) for rapid triage and reviewer guidance. Using this
pipeline, we build Mangrove3D, a semantic segmentation TLS dataset for mangrove
forests. We further evaluate data efficiency and feature importance to address
two key questions: (1) how much annotated data are needed and (2) which
features matter most. Results show that performance saturates after ~12
annotated scans, geometric features contribute the most, and compact
nine-channel stacks capture nearly all discriminative power, with the mean
Intersection over Union (mIoU) plateauing at around 0.76. Finally, we confirm
the generalization of our feature-enrichment strategy through cross-dataset
tests on ForestSemantic and Semantic3D.
  Our contributions include: (i) a robust, uncertainty-aware TLS annotation
pipeline with visualization tools; (ii) the Mangrove3D dataset; and (iii)
empirical guidance on data efficiency and feature importance, thus enabling
scalable, high-quality segmentation of TLS point clouds for ecological
monitoring and beyond. The dataset and processing scripts are publicly
available at https://fz-rit.github.io/through-the-lidars-eye/.

*Samir Abou Haidar,Alexandre Chariot,Mehdi Darouich,Cyril Joly,Jean-Emmanuel Deschaud*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HARP-NeXt是一个高速准确的LiDAR语义分割网络，通过新颖的预处理方法、Conv-SE-NeXt特征提取块和多尺度范围点融合骨干网络，在保持精度的同时显著提升速度，在nuScenes和SemanticKITTI基准测试中达到最佳速度-精度平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LiDAR语义分割方法在精度和速度之间存在权衡：基于点和稀疏卷积的方法准确但速度慢，基于投影的方法速度快但丢失几何信息，且多数方法依赖测试时增强进一步降低推理速度。预处理阶段在所有方法中都会增加执行时间，在嵌入式平台上尤为困难。

Method: 1. 提出新颖的预处理方法显著减少计算开销；2. 设计Conv-SE-NeXt特征提取块，无需在每个网络阶段堆叠深层即可高效捕获表示；3. 采用多尺度范围点融合骨干网络，在多个抽象级别利用信息以保留关键几何细节。

Result: 在nuScenes和SemanticKITTI基准测试中，HARP-NeXt相比所有最先进方法实现了优越的速度-精度权衡，在不依赖集成模型或测试时增强的情况下，性能与排名第一的PTv3相当，但运行速度快24倍。

Conclusion: HARP-NeXt通过创新的预处理、特征提取和融合架构，成功解决了LiDAR语义分割中精度与速度的权衡问题，为自动驾驶和移动机器人在资源受限嵌入式系统上的实时应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: LiDAR semantic segmentation is crucial for autonomous vehicles and mobile
robots, requiring high accuracy and real-time processing, especially on
resource-constrained embedded systems. Previous state-of-the-art methods often
face a trade-off between accuracy and speed. Point-based and sparse
convolution-based methods are accurate but slow due to the complexity of
neighbor searching and 3D convolutions. Projection-based methods are faster but
lose critical geometric information during the 2D projection. Additionally,
many recent methods rely on test-time augmentation (TTA) to improve
performance, which further slows the inference. Moreover, the pre-processing
phase across all methods increases execution time and is demanding on embedded
platforms. Therefore, we introduce HARP-NeXt, a high-speed and accurate LiDAR
semantic segmentation network. We first propose a novel pre-processing
methodology that significantly reduces computational overhead. Then, we design
the Conv-SE-NeXt feature extraction block to efficiently capture
representations without deep layer stacking per network stage. We also employ a
multi-scale range-point fusion backbone that leverages information at multiple
abstraction levels to preserve essential geometric details, thereby enhancing
accuracy. Experiments on the nuScenes and SemanticKITTI benchmarks show that
HARP-NeXt achieves a superior speed-accuracy trade-off compared to all
state-of-the-art methods, and, without relying on ensemble models or TTA, is
comparable to the top-ranked PTv3, while running 24$\times$ faster. The code is

### [31] [Improving Artifact Robustness for CT Deep Learning Models Without Labeled Artifact Images via Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06584)
*Justin Cheung,Samuel Savine,Calvin Nguyen,Lin Lu,Alhassan S. Yasin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究评估了领域自适应方法在CT图像分类中的有效性，特别是在处理训练时未见过的新型伪影（如环形伪影）时，能够保持模型性能而无需额外的标注数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在遇到训练分布之外的图像时性能会显著下降。CT扫描仪可能引入新的伪影，导致模型误分类。直接标注新分布图像成本高昂，因此需要更经济的解决方案。

Method: 在正弦图空间中模拟探测器增益误差产生的环形伪影，使用领域对抗神经网络（DANN）与基线方法和基于增强的方法进行比较，在OrganAMNIST腹部CT数据集上进行评估。

Result: 仅使用干净图像训练的基线模型无法泛化到有环形伪影的图像，传统增强方法对未见过的伪影域也无改善。DANN方法仅使用未标注的伪影数据就能在环形伪影图像上保持高分类准确率，其性能与使用标注伪影图像训练的模型相当，并意外地泛化到均匀噪声。

Conclusion: 领域自适应能有效解决医学成像中的分布偏移问题，无需昂贵的新伪影分布专家标注，在可能出现新型伪影的临床环境中具有应用前景。

Abstract: Deep learning models which perform well on images from their training
distribution can degrade substantially when applied to new distributions. If a
CT scanner introduces a new artifact not present in the training labels, the
model may misclassify the images. Although modern CT scanners include design
features which mitigate these artifacts, unanticipated or difficult-to-mitigate
artifacts can still appear in practice. The direct solution of labeling images
from this new distribution can be costly. As a more accessible alternative,
this study evaluates domain adaptation as an approach for training models that
maintain classification performance despite new artifacts, even without
corresponding labels. We simulate ring artifacts from detector gain error in
sinogram space and evaluate domain adversarial neural networks (DANN) against
baseline and augmentation-based approaches on the OrganAMNIST abdominal CT
dataset. Our results demonstrate that baseline models trained only on clean
images fail to generalize to images with ring artifacts, and traditional
augmentation with other distortion types provides no improvement on unseen
artifact domains. In contrast, the DANN approach successfully maintains high
classification accuracy on ring artifact images using only unlabeled artifact
data during training, demonstrating the viability of domain adaptation for
artifact robustness. The domain-adapted model achieved classification
performance on ring artifact test data comparable to models explicitly trained
with labeled artifact images, while also showing unexpected generalization to
uniform noise. These findings provide empirical evidence that domain adaptation
can effectively address distribution shift in medical imaging without requiring
expensive expert labeling of new artifact distributions, suggesting promise for
deployment in clinical settings where novel artifacts may emerge.

Motivation: 现有方法在离散潜在空间中使用分词器与大型语言模型的token对齐，但量化误差会限制语义表达能力并降低视觉语言理解能力。

Method: MingTok采用三阶段顺序架构：低级编码、语义扩展和视觉重建，通过连续潜在空间统一视觉理解和生成任务。

Result: 使用统一的连续视觉表示调和了理解和生成任务对分词器的竞争需求，在两个领域都达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: 连续域中的统一视觉分词器能够有效支持多轮、上下文任务，如迭代理解、生成和编辑，为社区提供了推理代码和模型权重。

Abstract: Visual tokenization remains a core challenge in unifying visual understanding
and generation within the autoregressive paradigm. Existing methods typically
employ tokenizers in discrete latent spaces to align with the tokens from large
language models, where the quantization errors can limit semantic
expressiveness and degrade the capability of vision-language understanding. To
address this, we introduce MingTok, a new family of visual tokenizers with a
continuous latent space, for unified autoregressive generation and
understanding. While understanding tasks favor discriminative high-dimensional
features, generation tasks prefer compact low-level codes. Thus, to reconcile
these competing demands, MingTok adopts a three-stage sequential architecture
involving low-level encoding, semantic expansion, and visual reconstruction.
Built on top of it, Ming-UniVision eliminates the need for task-specific visual
representations, and unifies diverse vision-language tasks under a single
autoregrsssive prediction paradigm. By formulating both understanding and
generation as next-token prediction in a shared continuous space, it seamlessly
supports multi-round, in-context tasks such as iterative understanding,
generation and editing. Empirically, we find that using a unified continuous
visual representation reconciles the competing requirements on the tokenizers
by the understanding and generation tasks, thereby leading to state-of-the-art
level performance across both domains. We hope our findings will facilitate
unified visual tokenization in the continuous domain. Inference code and model
weights are released to benefit community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字病理学分析中，染色协议和成像条件的差异会导致显著的颜色变异，这种颜色不一致性会降低深度学习模型在不同条件下的性能，即域偏移问题。现有颜色归一化方法存在引入伪影或需要仔细选择模板图像等缺点。

Method: 基于Beer-Lambert定律的物理成像过程，通过非负矩阵分解(NMF)模型的算法展开推导出模型架构，提取原始病理图像中的染色不变结构信息，作为下游任务的输入。该模型可与任何骨干网络集成。

Result: 在公开病理数据集和内部疟疾血涂片数据集上的实验表明，该方法在跨域目标检测和分类任务中优于许多最先进的染色归一化方法。

Conclusion: 提出的可训练颜色归一化模型能有效解决数字病理学中的颜色变异问题，提高模型在跨域场景下的性能表现。

Abstract: Deep learning advances have revolutionized automated digital pathology
analysis. However, differences in staining protocols and imaging conditions can
introduce significant color variability. In deep learning, such color
inconsistency often reduces performance when deploying models on data acquired
under different conditions from the training data, a challenge known as domain
shift. Many existing methods attempt to address this problem via color
normalization but suffer from several notable drawbacks such as introducing
artifacts or requiring careful choice of a template image for stain mapping. To
address these limitations, we propose a trainable color normalization model
that can be integrated with any backbone network for downstream tasks such as
object detection and classification. Based on the physics of the imaging
process per the Beer-Lambert law, our model architecture is derived via
algorithmic unrolling of a nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) model to
extract stain-invariant structural information from the original pathology
images, which serves as input for further processing. Experimentally, we
evaluate the method on publicly available pathology datasets and an internally
curated collection of malaria blood smears for cross-domain object detection
and classification, where our method outperforms many state-of-the-art stain
normalization methods. Our code is available at
https://github.com/xutianyue/BeerLaNet.

Result: SDQM与YOLOv11的mAP分数强相关，优于现有指标，并能提供改进数据集质量的可操作见解

Conclusion: SDQM为合成数据评估设定了新标准，是资源受限目标检测任务中高效生成和选择合成数据集的有效工具

Abstract: The performance of machine learning models depends heavily on training data.
The scarcity of large-scale, well-annotated datasets poses significant
challenges in creating robust models. To address this, synthetic data generated
through simulations and generative models has emerged as a promising solution,
enhancing dataset diversity and improving the performance, reliability, and
resilience of models. However, evaluating the quality of this generated data
requires an effective metric. This paper introduces the Synthetic Dataset
Quality Metric (SDQM) to assess data quality for object detection tasks without
requiring model training to converge. This metric enables more efficient
generation and selection of synthetic datasets, addressing a key challenge in
resource-constrained object detection tasks. In our experiments, SDQM
demonstrated a strong correlation with the mean Average Precision (mAP) scores
of YOLOv11, a leading object detection model, while previous metrics only
exhibited moderate or weak correlations. Additionally, it provides actionable
insights for improving dataset quality, minimizing the need for costly
iterative training. This scalable and efficient metric sets a new standard for
evaluating synthetic data. The code for SDQM is available at

Abstract: We introduce the AIM 2025 Real-World RAW Image Denoising Challenge, aiming to
advance efficient and effective denoising techniques grounded in data
synthesis. The competition is built upon a newly established evaluation
benchmark featuring challenging low-light noisy images captured in the wild
using five different DSLR cameras. Participants are tasked with developing
novel noise synthesis pipelines, network architectures, and training
methodologies to achieve high performance across different camera models.
Winners are determined based on a combination of performance metrics, including
full-reference measures (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS), and non-reference ones (ARNIQA,
TOPIQ). By pushing the boundaries of camera-agnostic low-light RAW image

Motivation: MRI扫描时间长限制了其广泛应用，深度学习重建方法能有效缩短采集时间，但在缺乏全采样数据时，自监督和无监督方法尤为重要。

Method: 采用物理引导的展开迭代重建架构，引入隐式神经表示作为正则化先验，结合深度展开结构和INR的隐式表示能力。

Result: 在10倍高加速率下，UnrollINR实现了优于监督学习方法的重建性能。

Conclusion: 该方法验证了所提方法的优越性，增强了模型的可解释性和重建性能。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a vital clinical diagnostic tool, yet its
widespread application is limited by prolonged scan times. Fast MRI
reconstruction techniques effectively reduce acquisition duration by
reconstructing high-fidelity MR images from undersampled k-space data. In
recent years, deep learning-based methods have demonstrated remarkable progress
in this field, with self-supervised and unsupervised learning approaches
proving particularly valuable in scenarios where fully sampled data are
difficult to obtain. This paper proposes a novel zero-shot self-supervised
reconstruction framework named UnrollINR, which enables scan-specific MRI
reconstruction without relying on external training data. The method adopts a
physics-guided unrolled iterative reconstruction architecture and introduces
Implicit Neural Representation (INR) as a regularization prior to effectively
constrain the solution space. By combining a deep unrolled structure with the
powerful implicit representation capability of INR, the model's
interpretability and reconstruction performance are enhanced. Experimental
results demonstrate that even at a high acceleration rate of 10, UnrollINR
achieves superior reconstruction performance compared to the supervised
learning method, validating the superiority of the proposed method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WristWorld是一个4D世界模型，能够仅从锚定视角生成腕部视角视频，填补了大规模数据集中腕部视角稀缺的空白，提升了视觉语言动作模型的操纵性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 腕部视角观察对于VLA模型至关重要，因为它捕捉了细粒度的手-物体交互，但大规模数据集很少包含此类记录，导致锚定视角丰富而腕部视角稀缺的显著差距。

Method: WristWorld采用两阶段方法：重建阶段扩展VGGT并引入空间投影一致性损失来估计几何一致的腕部视角姿态和4D点云；生成阶段使用视频生成模型从重建视角合成时间连贯的腕部视角视频。

Result: 在Droid、Calvin和Franka Panda上的实验展示了最先进的视频生成质量，具有优越的空间一致性，同时将Calvin上的平均任务完成长度提高了3.81%，并填补了42.4%的锚定-腕部视角差距。

Conclusion: WristWorld是第一个仅从锚定视角生成腕部视角视频的4D世界模型，有效解决了视角差距问题，显著提升了VLA模型的性能。

Abstract: Wrist-view observations are crucial for VLA models as they capture
fine-grained hand-object interactions that directly enhance manipulation
performance. Yet large-scale datasets rarely include such recordings, resulting
in a substantial gap between abundant anchor views and scarce wrist views.
Existing world models cannot bridge this gap, as they require a wrist-view
first frame and thus fail to generate wrist-view videos from anchor views
alone. Amid this gap, recent visual geometry models such as VGGT emerge with
geometric and cross-view priors that make it possible to address extreme
viewpoint shifts. Inspired by these insights, we propose WristWorld, the first
4D world model that generates wrist-view videos solely from anchor views.
WristWorld operates in two stages: (i) Reconstruction, which extends VGGT and
incorporates our Spatial Projection Consistency (SPC) Loss to estimate
geometrically consistent wrist-view poses and 4D point clouds; (ii) Generation,
which employs our video generation model to synthesize temporally coherent
wrist-view videos from the reconstructed perspective. Experiments on Droid,
Calvin, and Franka Panda demonstrate state-of-the-art video generation with
superior spatial consistency, while also improving VLA performance, raising the
average task completion length on Calvin by 3.81% and closing 42.4% of the
anchor-wrist view gap.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音驱动人脸合成模型在英语上表现良好，但在非英语语言中产生错误嘴型和僵硬面部表情，主要原因是训练数据以英语为主且缺乏跨语言泛化能力。

Method: 采用音素引导的混合专家架构，将音频和视频特征分别提取为音素和视素作为通用中间表示，并引入音素-视素对齐机制建立跨模态对应关系。

Result: 在包含12种语言的基准测试中表现出色，并在未见语言上展现出有效的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: MuEx框架通过音素和视素作为通用中间表示，成功实现了高质量的多语言语音驱动人脸合成，具有优秀的跨语言泛化性能。

Abstract: Speech-driven talking face synthesis (TFS) focuses on generating lifelike
facial animations from audio input. Current TFS models perform well in English
but unsatisfactorily in non-English languages, producing wrong mouth shapes and
rigid facial expressions. The terrible performance is caused by the
English-dominated training datasets and the lack of cross-language
generalization abilities. Thus, we propose Multilingual Experts (MuEx), a novel
framework featuring a Phoneme-Guided Mixture-of-Experts (PG-MoE) architecture
that employs phonemes and visemes as universal intermediaries to bridge audio
and video modalities, achieving lifelike multilingual TFS. To alleviate the
influence of linguistic differences and dataset bias, we extract audio and
video features as phonemes and visemes respectively, which are the basic units
of speech sounds and mouth movements. To address audiovisual synchronization
issues, we introduce the Phoneme-Viseme Alignment Mechanism (PV-Align), which
establishes robust cross-modal correspondences between phonemes and visemes. In
addition, we build a Multilingual Talking Face Benchmark (MTFB) comprising 12
diverse languages with 95.04 hours of high-quality videos for training and
evaluating multilingual TFS performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MuEx achieves superior performance across all languages in MTFB and exhibits
effective zero-shot generalization to unseen languages without additional
training.

Conclusion: MSITrack数据集具有推动该领域未来发展的潜力，已公开可用。

Abstract: Visual object tracking in real-world scenarios presents numerous challenges
including occlusion, interference from similar objects and complex
backgrounds-all of which limit the effectiveness of RGB-based trackers.
Multispectral imagery, which captures pixel-level spectral reflectance,
enhances target discriminability. However, the availability of multispectral
tracking datasets remains limited. To bridge this gap, we introduce MSITrack,
the largest and most diverse multispectral single object tracking dataset to
date. MSITrack offers the following key features: (i) More Challenging
Attributes-including interference from similar objects and similarity in color
and texture between targets and backgrounds in natural scenarios, along with a
wide range of real-world tracking challenges; (ii) Richer and More Natural
Scenes-spanning 55 object categories and 300 distinct natural scenes, MSITrack
far exceeds the scope of existing benchmarks. Many of these scenes and
categories are introduced to the multispectral tracking domain for the first
time; (iii) Larger Scale-300 videos comprising over 129k frames of
multispectral imagery. To ensure annotation precision, each frame has undergone
meticulous processing, manual labeling and multi-stage verification. Extensive
evaluations using representative trackers demonstrate that the multispectral
data in MSITrack significantly improves performance over RGB-only baselines,
highlighting its potential to drive future advancements in the field. The

Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在基于知识的视觉问答中缺乏显式推理监督、产生不一致解释和泛化能力差的问题。

Method: 构建路径基础推理轨迹的数据集，通过结构化自蒸馏进行微调，使生成与监督对齐，推理过程透明可验证。

Conclusion: StaR-KVQA通过结构化推理轨迹监督有效提升了MLLM在基于知识的视觉问答中的性能和可解释性，无需外部知识资源。

Abstract: Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KVQA) requires models to ground
entities in images and reason over factual knowledge. We study its
implicit-knowledge variant, IK-KVQA, where a multimodal large language model
(MLLM) is the sole knowledge source, without external retrieval. Yet, MLLMs
lack explicit reasoning supervision and produce inconsistent justifications,
and generalize poorly after standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We present
StaR-KVQA (Structured Reasoning Traces for IK-KVQA), which supervises
structured traces - dual symbolic relation paths plus path-grounded
natural-language explanations - so that reasoning becomes transparent and
verifiable. With one open-source MLLM, StaR-KVQA constructs and selects
path-grounded reasoning traces to form a trace-enriched dataset, then
fine-tunes via structured self-distillation to align generation with
supervision; no external retrievers, verifiers, or curated knowledge bases

autoregressive pass. Across benchmarks, StaR-KVQA improves both accuracy and
interpretability, achieving up to +11.3% higher answer accuracy on OK-VQA over
the strongest baseline while exhibiting robust cross-domain generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoNAD是一个用于工业表面缺陷检测的自动化神经网络架构设计框架，通过联合搜索卷积、Transformer和多层感知机，解决类内差异和类间相似性挑战，同时提高检测效率和部署性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业表面缺陷检测面临类内差异大和类间相似性高的挑战，现有手动设计模型需要大量试错且难以同时有效解决这两个问题。

Method: 提出AutoNAD框架，联合搜索卷积、Transformer和MLP的混合架构，引入跨权重共享策略加速训练，集成可搜索的多级特征聚合模块，并采用延迟感知先验指导高效架构选择。

Result: 在三个工业缺陷数据集上验证了有效性，并成功应用于缺陷成像和检测平台。

Conclusion: AutoNAD能够自动设计高效的缺陷检测网络，有效解决类内差异和类间相似性问题，降低人工网络设计成本，适合工业部署。

Abstract: Industrial surface defect detection (SDD) is critical for ensuring product
quality and manufacturing reliability. Due to the diverse shapes and sizes of
surface defects, SDD faces two main challenges: intraclass difference and
interclass similarity. Existing methods primarily utilize manually designed
models, which require extensive trial and error and often struggle to address
both challenges effectively. To overcome this, we propose AutoNAD, an automated
neural architecture design framework for SDD that jointly searches over
convolutions, transformers, and multi-layer perceptrons. This hybrid design
enables the model to capture both fine-grained local variations and long-range
semantic context, addressing the two key challenges while reducing the cost of
manual network design. To support efficient training of such a diverse search
space, AutoNAD introduces a cross weight sharing strategy, which accelerates
supernet convergence and improves subnet performance. Additionally, a
searchable multi-level feature aggregation module (MFAM) is integrated to
enhance multi-scale feature learning. Beyond detection accuracy, runtime
efficiency is essential for industrial deployment. To this end, AutoNAD
incorporates a latency-aware prior to guide the selection of efficient
architectures. The effectiveness of AutoNAD is validated on three industrial
defect datasets and further applied within a defect imaging and detection
platform. Code will be available at https://github.com/Yuxi104/AutoNAD.

TL;DR: Heptapod是一个基于语言建模原则的图像自回归模型，采用因果注意力、消除CFG依赖、避免语义分词器，通过预测2D空间分布实现图像生成，在ImageNet上达到FID 2.70的优异表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新思考视觉信号上的语言建模原则，探索更基础的图像生成方法，避免当前方法对CFG和语义分词器的依赖。

Method: 提出next 2D distribution prediction方法：使用因果Transformer和重建导向的视觉分词器，在每个时间步预测整个2D空间网格的分布，将自回归序列建模与掩码自编码的自监督学习统一。

Result: 在ImageNet生成基准测试中达到FID 2.70，显著优于之前的因果自回归方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作为视觉信号及其他领域的语言建模提供了原则性的重新思考，展示了基础建模方法在图像生成中的潜力。

Abstract: We introduce Heptapod, an image autoregressive model that adheres to the
foundational principles of language modeling. Heptapod employs \textbf{causal
attention}, \textbf{eliminates reliance on CFG}, and \textbf{eschews the trend
of semantic tokenizers}. Our key innovation is \textit{next 2D distribution
prediction}: a causal Transformer with reconstruction-focused visual tokenizer,
learns to predict the distribution over the entire 2D spatial grid of images at
each timestep. This learning objective unifies the sequential modeling of
autoregressive framework with the holistic self-supervised learning of masked
autoencoding, enabling the model to capture comprehensive image semantics via
generative training. On the ImageNet generation benchmark, Heptapod achieves an
FID of $2.70$, significantly outperforming previous causal autoregressive
approaches. We hope our work inspires a principled rethinking of language
modeling on visual signals and beyond.

TL;DR: DreamOmni2提出了多模态指令编辑和生成任务，通过特征混合方法创建数据，使用索引编码和位置编码方案处理多图像输入，在抽象和具体概念编辑生成方面取得显著成果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于指令的图像编辑仅依赖语言指令难以捕捉具体编辑细节，而主体驱动生成仅限于具体对象，忽略了抽象概念。需要支持文本和图像指令的多模态方法，扩展应用范围。

Method: 采用三步数据合成流程：特征混合方法创建提取数据，使用编辑和提取模型生成多模态指令编辑训练数据，进一步应用提取模型创建训练数据。框架采用索引编码和位置编码移位方案处理多图像输入，并与VLM联合训练处理复杂指令。

Result: 实验表明DreamOmni2取得了令人印象深刻的结果，能够有效处理抽象和具体概念的多模态指令编辑和生成任务。

Conclusion: DreamOmni2成功解决了多模态指令编辑和生成的关键挑战，包括数据创建和模型框架设计，为这两个新任务的发展提供了全面基准，具有重要的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Recent advancements in instruction-based image editing and subject-driven
generation have garnered significant attention, yet both tasks still face
limitations in meeting practical user needs. Instruction-based editing relies
solely on language instructions, which often fail to capture specific editing
details, making reference images necessary. Meanwhile, subject-driven
generation is limited to combining concrete objects or people, overlooking
broader, abstract concepts. To address these challenges, we propose two novel
tasks: multimodal instruction-based editing and generation. These tasks support
both text and image instructions and extend the scope to include both concrete
and abstract concepts, greatly enhancing their practical applications. We
introduce DreamOmni2, tackling two primary challenges: data creation and model
framework design. Our data synthesis pipeline consists of three steps: (1)
using a feature mixing method to create extraction data for both abstract and
concrete concepts, (2) generating multimodal instruction-based editing training
data using the editing and extraction models, and (3) further applying the
extraction model to create training data for multimodal instruction-based
editing. For the framework, to handle multi-image input, we propose an index
encoding and position encoding shift scheme, which helps the model distinguish
images and avoid pixel confusion. Additionally, we introduce joint training
with the VLM and our generation/editing model to better process complex
instructions. In addition, we have proposed comprehensive benchmarks for these
two new tasks to drive their development. Experiments show that DreamOmni2 has
achieved impressive results. Models and codes will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了首个融合光场数据和点云数据的多模态语义分割数据集，并开发了Mlpfseg网络，通过特征补全和深度感知模块解决了模态差异和遮挡问题，显著提升了分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶场景理解中的语义分割在遮挡等复杂条件下仍面临挑战。光场和LiDAR模态提供互补的视觉和空间线索，但受限于视角多样性和模态差异，难以有效融合。

Method: 提出Mlpfseg多模态融合分割网络，包含特征补全模块（通过点云特征图的差分重建解决密度不匹配问题）和深度感知模块（通过增强注意力分数提升遮挡感知能力），同时分割相机图像和LiDAR点云。

Result: 该方法比仅使用图像的分割方法提升了1.71 mIoU，比仅使用点云的分割方法提升了2.38 mIoU，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: 通过有效融合光场和点云模态，提出的方法在复杂条件下显著提升了语义分割性能，为自动驾驶场景理解提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation serves as a cornerstone of scene understanding in
autonomous driving but continues to face significant challenges under complex
conditions such as occlusion. Light field and LiDAR modalities provide
complementary visual and spatial cues that are beneficial for robust
perception; however, their effective integration is hindered by limited
viewpoint diversity and inherent modality discrepancies. To address these
challenges, the first multimodal semantic segmentation dataset integrating
light field data and point cloud data is proposed. Based on this dataset, we
proposed a multi-modal light field point-cloud fusion segmentation
network(Mlpfseg), incorporating feature completion and depth perception to
segment both camera images and LiDAR point clouds simultaneously. The feature
completion module addresses the density mismatch between point clouds and image
pixels by performing differential reconstruction of point-cloud feature maps,
enhancing the fusion of these modalities. The depth perception module improves
the segmentation of occluded objects by reinforcing attention scores for better
occlusion awareness. Our method outperforms image-only segmentation by 1.71
Mean Intersection over Union(mIoU) and point cloud-only segmentation by 2.38
mIoU, demonstrating its effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动态场景建模中准确捕捉变形同时保持计算效率的挑战，因为现实世界的变形通常呈现层次化模式。

Method: 采用级联优化框架，利用3D高斯泼溅中的结构模式，从粗粒度的部分级变形逐步细化到细粒度的点级变形。

Result: 每个时间帧在100次迭代内收敛，训练迭代次数仅为现有方法的二十分之一，结果质量相当。在自监督关节物体分割、新视角合成和密集点跟踪任务中表现有效。

Conclusion: SCas4D通过层次化变形建模实现了动态场景建模的高效性和准确性，在多个任务中展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Persistent dynamic scene modeling for tracking and novel-view synthesis
remains challenging due to the difficulty of capturing accurate deformations
while maintaining computational efficiency. We propose SCas4D, a cascaded
optimization framework that leverages structural patterns in 3D Gaussian
Splatting for dynamic scenes. The key idea is that real-world deformations
often exhibit hierarchical patterns, where groups of Gaussians share similar
transformations. By progressively refining deformations from coarse part-level
to fine point-level, SCas4D achieves convergence within 100 iterations per time
frame and produces results comparable to existing methods with only
one-twentieth of the training iterations. The approach also demonstrates
effectiveness in self-supervised articulated object segmentation, novel view
synthesis, and dense point tracking tasks.

*Maria Levchenko*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了评估基于LLM的历史文档OCR的新方法，解决了传统指标无法捕捉时间偏差和特定时期错误的问题，引入了历史字符保存率和古体插入率等新指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字人文学者越来越多地使用大语言模型进行历史文档数字化，但缺乏适当的评估框架来评估基于LLM的OCR。传统指标无法捕捉对历史语料库创建至关重要的时间偏差和特定时期错误。

Method: 使用18世纪俄罗斯民用字体文本，引入了包括历史字符保存率和古体插入率在内的新指标，以及污染控制和稳定性测试协议。评估了12个多模态LLM。

Result: 发现Gemini和Qwen模型优于传统OCR，但表现出过度历史化：从错误的历史时期插入古体字符。OCR后校正反而降低了性能。

Conclusion: 该评估方法为数字人文学者在历史语料库数字化中的模型选择和质量评估提供了指导方针。

Abstract: Digital humanities scholars increasingly use Large Language Models for
historical document digitization, yet lack appropriate evaluation frameworks
for LLM-based OCR. Traditional metrics fail to capture temporal biases and
period-specific errors crucial for historical corpus creation. We present an
evaluation methodology for LLM-based historical OCR, addressing contamination
risks and systematic biases in diplomatic transcription. Using 18th-century
Russian Civil font texts, we introduce novel metrics including Historical
Character Preservation Rate (HCPR) and Archaic Insertion Rate (AIR), alongside
protocols for contamination control and stability testing. We evaluate 12
multimodal LLMs, finding that Gemini and Qwen models outperform traditional OCR
while exhibiting over-historicization: inserting archaic characters from
incorrect historical periods. Post-OCR correction degrades rather than improves
performance. Our methodology provides digital humanities practitioners with
guidelines for model selection and quality assessment in historical corpus
digitization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeRainMamba是一个用于单幅图像去雨的新方法，结合了频域感知状态空间模块和多方向感知卷积，在保持图像细节的同时有效去除雨痕，在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Mamba模型在序列建模方面效率高，但捕捉细粒度细节的能力有限且缺乏频域感知，这限制了图像去雨效果的进一步提升。

Method: 提出DeRainMamba方法，包含频域感知状态空间模块(FASSM)和多方向感知卷积(MDPConv)。FASSM利用傅里叶变换区分雨痕和图像高频细节；MDPConv通过捕捉各向异性梯度特征和融合多个卷积分支来恢复局部结构。

Result: 在四个公共基准测试上的广泛实验表明，DeRainMamba在PSNR和SSIM指标上始终优于最先进的方法，同时需要更少的参数和更低的计算成本。

Conclusion: 在状态空间框架内结合频域建模和空间细节增强对于单幅图像去雨是有效的，DeRainMamba验证了这种方法的有效性。

Abstract: Image deraining is crucial for improving visual quality and supporting
reliable downstream vision tasks. Although Mamba-based models provide efficient
sequence modeling, their limited ability to capture fine-grained details and
lack of frequency-domain awareness restrict further improvements. To address
these issues, we propose DeRainMamba, which integrates a Frequency-Aware
State-Space Module (FASSM) and Multi-Directional Perception Convolution
(MDPConv). FASSM leverages Fourier transform to distinguish rain streaks from
high-frequency image details, balancing rain removal and detail preservation.
MDPConv further restores local structures by capturing anisotropic gradient
features and efficiently fusing multiple convolution branches. Extensive
experiments on four public benchmarks demonstrate that DeRainMamba consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in PSNR and SSIM, while requiring fewer
parameters and lower computational costs. These results validate the
effectiveness of combining frequency-domain modeling and spatial detail
enhancement within a state-space framework for single image deraining.

TL;DR: OBS-Diff是一种新颖的一次性剪枝框架，用于大规模文生图扩散模型的无训练压缩，通过改进经典OBS算法、时间步感知Hessian构建和分组顺序剪枝策略实现高效压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模文生图扩散模型计算成本过高，现有的一次性网络剪枝方法难以直接应用于扩散模型，因为扩散模型具有迭代去噪的特性。

Method: 1. 改进经典最优脑外科医生算法，适应现代扩散模型复杂架构，支持多种剪枝粒度；2. 提出时间步感知Hessian构建，采用对数递减权重方案，更重视早期时间步以减少误差累积；3. 提出计算高效的分组顺序剪枝策略。

Result: 广泛实验表明，OBS-Diff在扩散模型的一次性剪枝方面达到最先进水平，在视觉质量最小退化的情况下实现推理加速。

Conclusion: OBS-Diff成功解决了扩散模型一次性剪枝的挑战，为大规模文生图扩散模型的高效压缩提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models, while powerful, suffer from
prohibitive computational cost. Existing one-shot network pruning methods can
hardly be directly applied to them due to the iterative denoising nature of
diffusion models. To bridge the gap, this paper presents OBS-Diff, a novel
one-shot pruning framework that enables accurate and training-free compression
of large-scale text-to-image diffusion models. Specifically, (i) OBS-Diff
revitalizes the classic Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS), adapting it to the complex
architectures of modern diffusion models and supporting diverse pruning
granularity, including unstructured, N:M semi-structured, and structured (MHA
heads and FFN neurons) sparsity; (ii) To align the pruning criteria with the
iterative dynamics of the diffusion process, by examining the problem from an
error-accumulation perspective, we propose a novel timestep-aware Hessian
construction that incorporates a logarithmic-decrease weighting scheme,
assigning greater importance to earlier timesteps to mitigate potential error
accumulation; (iii) Furthermore, a computationally efficient group-wise
sequential pruning strategy is proposed to amortize the expensive calibration
process. Extensive experiments show that OBS-Diff achieves state-of-the-art
one-shot pruning for diffusion models, delivering inference acceleration with
minimal degradation in visual quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督高斯去噪器在面对分布外噪声时泛化能力有限，因为不同噪声类型具有不同的分布特性。

Method: 使用直方图匹配将任意噪声转换为目标高斯分布；建立噪声变换与去噪的相互增强循环；针对特定噪声复杂性采用局部直方图匹配、片内置换和频域直方图匹配等方法。

Result: 单一高斯去噪器获得了显著处理各种分布外噪声的能力，包括泊松噪声、椒盐噪声、重复模式噪声以及复杂的真实世界噪声。

Conclusion: 该方法通过噪声变换和相互增强循环，显著提升了高斯去噪器的泛化能力和有效性。

Abstract: Supervised Gaussian denoisers exhibit limited generalization when confronted
with out-of-distribution noise, due to the diverse distributional
characteristics of different noise types. To bridge this gap, we propose a
histogram matching approach that transforms arbitrary noise towards a target
Gaussian distribution with known intensity. Moreover, a mutually reinforcing
cycle is established between noise transformation and subsequent denoising.
This cycle progressively refines the noise to be converted, making it
approximate the real noise, thereby enhancing the noise transformation effect
and further improving the denoising performance. We tackle specific noise
complexities: local histogram matching handles signal-dependent noise,
intrapatch permutation processes channel-related noise, and frequency-domain
histogram matching coupled with pixel-shuffle down-sampling breaks spatial
correlation. By applying these transformations, a single Gaussian denoiser
gains remarkable capability to handle various out-of-distribution noises,
including synthetic noises such as Poisson, salt-and-pepper and repeating
pattern noises, as well as complex real-world noises. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superior generalization and effectiveness of our method.

Motivation: 解决高分辨率土地覆盖制图中机器学习方法面临的训练标签数量不足和质量不高的问题，利用现有的低分辨率或过时产品获取大量弱标签。

Method: 采用深度多示例学习框架，通过灵活池化层将高分辨率影像中的像素语义与低分辨率参考标签关联，在多类和多标签设置下重新构建多示例学习问题，并使用正未标记学习策略训练分类器。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效利用弱标签训练高分辨率土地覆盖分类器，为缺乏高质量标注数据的遥感应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The quantity and the quality of the training labels are central problems in
high-resolution land-cover mapping with machine-learning-based solutions. In
this context, weak labels can be gathered in large quantities by leveraging on
existing low-resolution or obsolete products. In this paper, we address the
problem of training land-cover classifiers using high-resolution imagery (e.g.,
Sentinel-2) and weak low-resolution reference data (e.g., MODIS -derived
land-cover maps). Inspired by recent works in Deep Multiple Instance Learning
(DMIL), we propose a method that trains pixel-level multi-class classifiers and
predicts low-resolution labels (i.e., patch-level classification), where the
actual high-resolution labels are learned implicitly without direct
supervision. This is achieved with flexible pooling layers that are able to
link the semantics of the pixels in the high-resolution imagery to the
low-resolution reference labels. Then, the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)
problem is re-framed in a multi-class and in a multi-label setting. In the
former, the low-resolution annotation represents the majority of the pixels in
the patch. In the latter, the annotation only provides us information on the
presence of one of the land-cover classes in the patch and thus multiple labels
can be considered valid for a patch at a time, whereas the low-resolution
labels provide us only one label. Therefore, the classifier is trained with a
Positive-Unlabeled Learning (PUL) strategy. Experimental results on the 2020
IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed
framework compared to standard training strategies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TTRV提出了一种无需标注数据的测试时强化学习方法，通过基于基础模型输出频率设计奖励信号，在推理时动态适应视觉语言模型，在物体识别和视觉问答任务上取得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法依赖标注数据和专用训练集，这与人类直接从环境中学习的方式不符。本文旨在开发无需标注数据、在推理时直接适应环境的强化学习方法。

Method: 基于GRPO框架，设计基于基础模型输出频率的奖励信号，在测试样本上进行多次推理，同时通过奖励低熵输出分布来控制模型输出的多样性。

Result: 在物体识别和视觉问答任务上分别获得最高52.4%和29.8%的提升，平均提升24.6%和10.0%。在图像识别任务中，TTRV应用于InternVL 8B模型平均超越GPT-4o 2.3%。

Conclusion: 测试时强化学习能够匹配甚至超越最强专有模型，即使在极端数据受限场景下（仅使用单个未标注测试样本）也能获得显著改进，证明了该方法的有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Existing methods for extracting reward signals in Reinforcement Learning
typically rely on labeled data and dedicated training splits, a setup that
contrasts with how humans learn directly from their environment. In this work,
we propose TTRV to enhance vision language understanding by adapting the model
on the fly at inference time, without the need for any labeled data.
Concretely, we enhance the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework
by designing rewards based on the frequency of the base model's output, while
inferring on each test sample multiple times. Further, we also propose to
control the diversity of the model's output by simultaneously rewarding the
model for obtaining low entropy of the output empirical distribution. Our
approach delivers consistent gains across both object recognition and visual
question answering (VQA), with improvements of up to 52.4% and 29.8%,
respectively, and average boosts of 24.6% and 10.0% across 16
datasets.Remarkably, on image recognition, TTRV applied to InternVL 8B
surpasses GPT-4o by an average of 2.3% over 8 benchmarks, while remaining
highly competitive on VQA, demonstrating that test-time reinforcement learning
can match or exceed the strongest proprietary models. Finally, we find many
interesting properties of test-time RL for VLMs: for example, even in extremely
data-constrained scenarios, where adaptation is performed on a single randomly
chosen unlabeled test example, TTRV still yields non-trivial improvements of up
to 5.5% in recognition tasks.

Result: 该方法在新任务上取得强劲结果，甚至优于效率较低的生成为法。

Conclusion: 提出的样本自由方法在单图像极端非模态检测中表现出色，为安全和隐私应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Extreme amodal detection is the task of inferring the 2D location of objects
that are not fully visible in the input image but are visible within an
expanded field-of-view. This differs from amodal detection, where the object is
partially visible within the input image, but is occluded. In this paper, we
consider the sub-problem of face detection, since this class provides
motivating applications involving safety and privacy, but do not tailor our
method specifically to this class. Existing approaches rely on image sequences
so that missing detections may be interpolated from surrounding frames or make
use of generative models to sample possible completions. In contrast, we
consider the single-image task and propose a more efficient, sample-free
approach that makes use of the contextual cues from the image to infer the
presence of unseen faces. We design a heatmap-based extreme amodal object
detector that addresses the problem of efficiently predicting a lot (the
out-of-frame region) from a little (the image) with a selective coarse-to-fine
decoder. Our method establishes strong results for this new task, even
outperforming less efficient generative approaches.

Abstract: Echocardiography is a critical tool for detecting heart diseases. Recently,
ultrasound foundation models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
cardiac ultrasound image analysis. However, obtaining high-quality ultrasound
images is a prerequisite for accurate diagnosis. Due to the exceptionally high
operational difficulty of cardiac ultrasound, there is a shortage of highly
skilled personnel, which hinders patients from receiving timely examination
services. In this paper, we aim to adapt the medical knowledge learned by
foundation models from vast datasets to the probe guidance task, which is
designed to provide real-time operational recommendations for junior
sonographers to acquire high-quality ultrasound images. Moreover, inspired by
the practice where experts optimize action decisions based on past
explorations, we meticulously design a parameter-efficient Vision-Action
Adapter (VA-Adapter) to enable foundation model's image encoder to encode
vision-action sequences, thereby enhancing guidance performance. With built-in
sequential reasoning capabilities in a compact design, the VA-Adapter enables a
pre-trained ultrasound foundation model to learn precise probe adjustment
strategies by fine-tuning only a small subset of parameters. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the VA-Adapter can surpass strong probe guidance
models. Our code will be released after acceptance.

where joint-encoder rerankers are standard, comparable vision--language
rerankers are largely absent. We find that seminal joint encoders such as BLIP
are severely bottlenecked by an expensive visual feature-extraction stage,
preventing practical deployment at scale. Motivated by this bottleneck, we
introduce EDJE, an Efficient Discriminative Joint Encoder that precomputes
vision tokens offline and compresses them via a lightweight attention-based
adapter, so online inference runs only a compact joint encoder over a small set
of visual tokens plus the text. EDJE preserves strong retrieval performance
while drastically reducing storage and online compute, enabling high-throughput
inference. Specifically, EDJE processes 50k image--text pairs/second while
requiring 49kB of disk storage per image, matching prior art on Flickr
(zero-shot) and COCO (fine-tuned) retrieval. The implementation and checkpoints
will be made publicly available shortly.

### [55] [StyleKeeper: Prevent Content Leakage using Negative Visual Query Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06827)
*Jaeseok Jeong,Junho Kim,Gayoung Lee,Yunjey Choi,Youngjung Uh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为负视觉查询引导(NVQG)的新方法，通过扩展无分类器引导并引入负分数来减少文本到图像生成中的内容泄漏问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉提示方法存在内容泄漏问题，即视觉风格提示中不需要的元素会与预期风格一起被转移。

Method: 1) 扩展无分类器引导(CFG)以利用交换自注意力；2) 提出负视觉查询引导(NVQG)，通过故意模拟内容泄漏场景来减少不需要内容的转移。

Result: 该方法在各种风格和文本提示下表现出色，能准确反映参考图像风格并确保生成图像与文本提示匹配。

Conclusion: NVQG是一种简单而有效的方法，显著减少了内容泄漏，在文本到图像生成中实现了更好的风格控制。

Abstract: In the domain of text-to-image generation, diffusion models have emerged as
powerful tools. Recently, studies on visual prompting, where images are used as
prompts, have enabled more precise control over style and content. However,
existing methods often suffer from content leakage, where undesired elements of
the visual style prompt are transferred along with the intended style. To
address this issue, we 1) extend classifier-free guidance (CFG) to utilize
swapping self-attention and propose 2) negative visual query guidance (NVQG) to
reduce the transfer of unwanted contents. NVQG employs negative score by
intentionally simulating content leakage scenarios that swap queries instead of
key and values of self-attention layers from visual style prompts. This simple
yet effective method significantly reduces content leakage. Furthermore, we
provide careful solutions for using a real image as visual style prompts.
Through extensive evaluation across various styles and text prompts, our method
demonstrates superiority over existing approaches, reflecting the style of the
references, and ensuring that resulting images match the text prompts. Our code
is available \href{https://github.com/naver-ai/StyleKeeper}{here}.

TL;DR: 提出了一种仅使用高分辨率事件相机进行实时线段检测和跟踪的方法，通过速度不变事件表示、基于拟合得分的线段检测和端点扰动的线段跟踪，实现了比现有方法更高的精度和实时性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机能够有效捕捉人造环境的几何特征，但现有方法要么依赖额外的帧相机，要么难以处理高事件率。本研究旨在实现仅使用现代高分辨率事件相机的实时线段检测和跟踪。

Method: 采用网格分配流水线，包括：(i) 速度不变事件表示，(ii) 基于拟合得分的线段检测，(iii) 通过端点扰动进行线段跟踪。

Result: 在专门录制的数据集和公开数据集上的评估表明，该方法实现了实时性能，并且比最先进的仅事件和事件-帧混合基线方法具有更高的精度。

Conclusion: 该方法支持完全独立的事件相机操作，能够在真实世界环境中实现实时线段检测和跟踪。

Abstract: Line segment extraction is effective for capturing geometric features of
human-made environments. Event-based cameras, which asynchronously respond to
contrast changes along edges, enable efficient extraction by reducing redundant
data. However, recent methods often rely on additional frame cameras or
struggle with high event rates. This research addresses real-time line segment
detection and tracking using only a modern, high-resolution (i.e., high event
rate) event-based camera. Our lattice-allocated pipeline consists of (i)
velocity-invariant event representation, (ii) line segment detection based on a
fitting score, (iii) and line segment tracking by perturbating endpoints.
Evaluation using ad-hoc recorded dataset and public datasets demonstrates
real-time performance and higher accuracy compared to state-of-the-art
event-only and event-frame hybrid baselines, enabling fully stand-alone event
camera operation in real-world settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了持续动作质量评估(CAQA)框架，通过自适应流形对齐图正则化(MAGR++)方法解决传统方法在非平稳质量分布下的泛化问题，有效缓解灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中动作质量分布的非平稳特性限制了传统AQA方法的泛化能力，需要引入持续学习能力来处理不断演化的分布。

Method: 提出MAGR++方法，结合全参数微调进行有效表示学习，通过流形投影器和图正则化器进行特征校正，稳定浅层网络并适应深层网络。

Result: 在四个CAQA基准测试中取得最优性能，离线平均相关性提升3.6%，在线提升12.2%，证实了方法的鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: MAGR++成功解决了CAQA中的灾难性遗忘问题，为处理非平稳质量分布提供了有效解决方案，在动作质量评估领域实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Action Quality Assessment (AQA) quantifies human actions in videos,
supporting applications in sports scoring, rehabilitation, and skill
evaluation. A major challenge lies in the non-stationary nature of quality
distributions in real-world scenarios, which limits the generalization ability
of conventional methods. We introduce Continual AQA (CAQA), which equips AQA
with Continual Learning (CL) capabilities to handle evolving distributions
while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Although parameter-efficient
fine-tuning of pretrained models has shown promise in CL for image
classification, we find it insufficient for CAQA. Our empirical and theoretical
analyses reveal two insights: (i) Full-Parameter Fine-Tuning (FPFT) is
necessary for effective representation learning; yet (ii) uncontrolled FPFT
induces overfitting and feature manifold shift, thereby aggravating forgetting.
To address this, we propose Adaptive Manifold-Aligned Graph Regularization
(MAGR++), which couples backbone fine-tuning that stabilizes shallow layers
while adapting deeper ones with a two-step feature rectification pipeline: a
manifold projector to translate deviated historical features into the current
representation space, and a graph regularizer to align local and global
distributions. We construct four CAQA benchmarks from three datasets with
tailored evaluation protocols and strong baselines, enabling systematic
cross-dataset comparison. Extensive experiments show that MAGR++ achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with average correlation gains of 3.6% offline
and 12.2% online over the strongest baseline, confirming its robustness and
effectiveness. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZhouKanglei/MAGRPP.

TL;DR: 提出在线通用事件边界检测任务(On-GEBD)，开发Estimator框架实现实时视频流中事件边界检测，无需未来帧信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GEBD方法需要处理完整视频帧，而人类能够在线实时处理数据。为弥合这一差距，需要开发能够实时检测流视频中通用事件边界的方法。

Method: 基于事件分割理论，提出Estimator框架，包含一致性事件预测器(CEA)和在线边界判别器(OBD)。CEA基于历史帧预测未来帧，OBD通过统计测试测量预测误差并自适应调整阈值。

Result: 在Kinetics-GEBD和TAPOS数据集上，Estimator优于所有在线视频理解基线方法，性能与离线GEBD方法相当。

Conclusion: 提出的On-GEBD任务和Estimator框架成功实现了实时事件边界检测，填补了在线处理与离线处理之间的空白。

Abstract: Generic Event Boundary Detection (GEBD) aims to interpret long-form videos
through the lens of human perception. However, current GEBD methods require
processing complete video frames to make predictions, unlike humans processing
data online and in real-time. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new task,
Online Generic Event Boundary Detection (On-GEBD), aiming to detect boundaries
of generic events immediately in streaming videos. This task faces unique
challenges of identifying subtle, taxonomy-free event changes in real-time,
without the access to future frames. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
novel On-GEBD framework, Estimator, inspired by Event Segmentation Theory (EST)
which explains how humans segment ongoing activity into events by leveraging
the discrepancies between predicted and actual information. Our framework
consists of two key components: the Consistent Event Anticipator (CEA), and the
Online Boundary Discriminator (OBD). Specifically, the CEA generates a
prediction of the future frame reflecting current event dynamics based solely
on prior frames. Then, the OBD measures the prediction error and adaptively
adjusts the threshold using statistical tests on past errors to capture
diverse, subtle event transitions. Experimental results demonstrate that
Estimator outperforms all baselines adapted from recent online video
understanding models and achieves performance comparable to prior offline-GEBD
methods on the Kinetics-GEBD and TAPOS datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着处理能力提升，在卫星上直接部署AI模型变得可行，但使用原始未处理的传感器数据而非预处理的地面产品带来了新的挑战。当前解决方案主要依赖预处理图像，很少有方法直接利用原始数据。

Method: 引入模拟工作流程从高分辨率L1图像生成类原始产品，系统评估两种目标检测模型（YOLOv11s和YOLOX-S）在原始数据和L1数据集上的性能，使用标准检测指标和可解释性工具进行比较。

Result: 结果显示，在低到中等置信度阈值下，两种模型表现相似，但在高置信度水平下，原始数据训练的模型在目标边界识别方面存在困难。

Conclusion: 通过改进轮廓检测方法调整AI架构，可以增强原始图像上的目标检测性能，从而改进遥感领域的星载AI应用。

Abstract: With increasing processing power, deploying AI models for remote sensing
directly onboard satellites is becoming feasible. However, new constraints
arise, mainly when using raw, unprocessed sensor data instead of preprocessed
ground-based products. While current solutions primarily rely on preprocessed
sensor images, few approaches directly leverage raw data. This study
investigates the effects of utilising raw data on deep learning models for
object detection and classification tasks. We introduce a simulation workflow
to generate raw-like products from high-resolution L1 imagery, enabling
systemic evaluation. Two object detection models (YOLOv11s and YOLOX-S) are
trained on both raw and L1 datasets, and their performance is compared using
standard detection metrics and explainability tools. Results indicate that
while both models perform similarly at low to medium confidence thresholds, the
model trained on raw data struggles with object boundary identification at high
confidence levels. It suggests that adapting AI architectures with improved
contouring methods can enhance object detection on raw images, improving
onboard AI for remote sensing.

Abstract: Lung infections, particularly pneumonia, pose serious health risks that can
escalate rapidly, especially during pandemics. Accurate AI-based severity
prediction from medical imaging is essential to support timely clinical
decisions and optimize patient outcomes. In this work, we present a novel
method applicable to both CT scans and chest X-rays for assessing lung
infection severity. Our contributions are twofold: (i) QCross-Att-PVT, a
Transformer-based architecture that integrates parallel encoders, a cross-gated
attention mechanism, and a feature aggregator to capture rich multi-scale
features; and (ii) Conditional Online TransMix, a custom data augmentation
strategy designed to address dataset imbalance by generating mixed-label image
patches during training. Evaluated on two benchmark datasets, RALO CXR and
Per-COVID-19 CT, our method consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art
deep learning models. The results emphasize the critical role of data
augmentation and gated attention in improving both robustness and predictive
accuracy. This approach offers a reliable, adaptable tool to support clinical

Motivation: 现有变化检测方法（特别是深度学习方法）的成功依赖于手工标注的训练数据，这些数据需要捕获采集条件和用户主观性。为了减少标注成本，需要开发标签高效的学习方法。

Method: 使用可逆图卷积网络生成虚拟样本作为关键样本，通过对抗性损失优化样本的表示性、多样性和模糊性，挑战当前变化检测标准，在主动学习迭代中重新估计这些标准。

Result: 大量实验表明，该标签高效学习模型相比对比方法具有积极影响，能够有效减少标注需求。

Conclusion: 提出的主动学习方法通过生成关键虚拟样本，显著提高了变化检测的标签效率，为遥感图像分析提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Change detection is a major task in remote sensing which consists in finding
all the occurrences of changes in multi-temporal satellite or aerial images.
The success of existing methods, and particularly deep learning ones, is
tributary to the availability of hand-labeled training data that capture the
acquisition conditions and the subjectivity of the user (oracle). In this
paper, we devise a novel change detection algorithm, based on active learning.
The main contribution of our work resides in a new model that measures how
important is each unlabeled sample, and provides an oracle with only the most
critical samples (also referred to as virtual exemplars) for further labeling.
These exemplars are generated, using an invertible graph convnet, as the
optimum of an adversarial loss that (i) measures representativity, diversity
and ambiguity of the data, and thereby (ii) challenges (the most) the current
change detection criteria, leading to a better re-estimate of these criteria in
the subsequent iterations of active learning. Extensive experiments show the
positive impact of our label-efficient learning model against comparative
methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IAR2提出了一个分层语义-细节合成框架，通过双码本结构将图像表示解耦为语义码本和细节码本，显著提升了自回归图像生成的表达能力和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自回归模型往往忽视视觉数据的固有结构特性，之前的IAR方法受到预训练码本刚性和硬聚类不准确性的限制，需要更灵活的分层表示方法。

Method: 提出语义-细节关联双码本结构，将图像表示解耦为语义码本和细节码本；采用分层预测方案，先预测语义token再预测细节token；引入局部上下文增强机制和渐进注意力引导的自适应CFG机制。

Result: 在ImageNet上达到FID 1.50的新SOTA性能，不仅超越了先前方法，还展示了优越的计算效率。

Conclusion: IAR2通过结构化的粗到细生成策略，有效提升了自回归图像生成的表达能力和质量，证明了分层语义-细节合成方法的有效性。

Abstract: Autoregressive models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for visual content
creation, but often overlook the intrinsic structural properties of visual
data. Our prior work, IAR, initiated a direction to address this by
reorganizing the visual codebook based on embedding similarity, thereby
improving generation robustness. However, it is constrained by the rigidity of
pre-trained codebooks and the inaccuracies of hard, uniform clustering. To
overcome these limitations, we propose IAR2, an advanced autoregressive
framework that enables a hierarchical semantic-detail synthesis process. At the
core of IAR2 is a novel Semantic-Detail Associated Dual Codebook, which
decouples image representations into a semantic codebook for global semantic
information and a detail codebook for fine-grained refinements. It expands the
quantization capacity from a linear to a polynomial scale, significantly
enhancing expressiveness. To accommodate this dual representation, we propose a
Semantic-Detail Autoregressive Prediction scheme coupled with a Local-Context
Enhanced Autoregressive Head, which performs hierarchical prediction-first the
semantic token, then the detail token-while leveraging a local context window
to enhance spatial coherence. Furthermore, for conditional generation, we
introduce a Progressive Attention-Guided Adaptive CFG mechanism that
dynamically modulates the guidance scale for each token based on its relevance
to the condition and its temporal position in the generation sequence,
improving conditional alignment without sacrificing realism. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that IAR2 sets a new state-of-the-art for
autoregressive image generation, achieving a FID of 1.50 on ImageNet. Our model
not only surpasses previous methods in performance but also demonstrates
superior computational efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness of our
structured, coarse-to-fine generation strategy.

Motivation: 现有3D对抗攻击方法存在两个关键限制：很少能导致物体完全消失，且难以在物理环境中实现。需要开发物理可实现的攻击方法来彻底测试LiDAR检测系统并暴露其漏洞。

Method: 通过系统研究影响检测脆弱性的因素，提出物理信息文本到3D对抗生成方法，通过迭代优化动词、对象和姿态来生成LiDAR不可见的行人。为确保物理可实现性，构建包含13个真实物体3D模型的对象池，并约束生成过程。

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成物理可实现的对抗性3D物体，揭示了安全关键应用中的漏洞，为自动驾驶系统的安全测试提供了有效工具。

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D object detectors are fundamental to autonomous driving, where
failing to detect objects poses severe safety risks. Developing effective 3D
adversarial attacks is essential for thoroughly testing these detection systems
and exposing their vulnerabilities before real-world deployment. However,
existing adversarial attacks that add optimized perturbations to 3D points have
two critical limitations: they rarely cause complete object disappearance and
prove difficult to implement in physical environments. We introduce the
text-to-3D adversarial generation method, a novel approach enabling physically
realizable attacks that can generate 3D models of objects truly invisible to
LiDAR detectors and be easily realized in the real world. Specifically, we
present the first empirical study that systematically investigates the factors
influencing detection vulnerability by manipulating the topology, connectivity,
and intensity of individual pedestrian 3D models and combining pedestrians with
multiple objects within the CARLA simulation environment. Building on the
insights, we propose the physically-informed text-to-3D adversarial generation
(Phy3DAdvGen) that systematically optimizes text prompts by iteratively
refining verbs, objects, and poses to produce LiDAR-invisible pedestrians. To
ensure physical realizability, we construct a comprehensive object pool
containing 13 3D models of real objects and constrain Phy3DAdvGen to generate
3D objects based on combinations of objects in this set. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach can generate 3D pedestrians that evade six
state-of-the-art (SOTA) LiDAR 3D detectors in both CARLA simulation and
physical environments, thereby highlighting vulnerabilities in safety-critical
applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Text-to-3D modeling have shown significant potential
for the creation of 3D content. However, due to the complex geometric shapes of
objects in the natural world, generating 3D content remains a challenging task.
Current methods either leverage 2D diffusion priors to recover 3D geometry, or
train the model directly based on specific 3D representations. In this paper,
we propose a novel method named DirectGaussian, which focuses on generating the
surfaces of 3D objects represented by surfels. In DirectGaussian, we utilize
conditional text generation models and the surface of a 3D object is rendered
by 2D Gaussian splatting with multi-view normal and texture priors. For
multi-view geometric consistency problems, DirectGaussian incorporates
curvature constraints on the generated surface during optimization process.
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework is capable of
achieving diverse and high-fidelity 3D content creation.

Motivation: 现有基于DETR的HD地图构建方法依赖独立的对象查询，缺乏全局视角，忽略了HD地图固有的全局表示特性

Method: 提出两个协同模块：全局表示学习模块（GRL）通过整体分割任务使查询分布与全局地图对齐；全局表示引导模块（GRG）为每个查询提供显式的全局上下文信息

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse2数据集上验证，相比领先基线方法在平均精度上取得显著提升

Conclusion: MapGR通过全局表示学习有效提升了HD地图构建性能，证明了全局视角在向量化地图构建中的重要性

Abstract: The online construction of vectorized high-definition (HD) maps is a
cornerstone of modern autonomous driving systems. State-of-the-art approaches,
particularly those based on the DETR framework, formulate this as an instance
detection problem. However, their reliance on independent, learnable object
queries results in a predominantly local query perspective, neglecting the
inherent global representation within HD maps. In this work, we propose
\textbf{MapGR} (\textbf{G}lobal \textbf{R}epresentation learning for HD
\textbf{Map} construction), an architecture designed to learn and utilize a
global representations from queries. Our method introduces two synergistic
modules: a Global Representation Learning (GRL) module, which encourages the
distribution of all queries to better align with the global map through a
carefully designed holistic segmentation task, and a Global Representation
Guidance (GRG) module, which endows each individual query with explicit,
global-level contextual information to facilitate its optimization. Evaluations
on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets validate the efficacy of our approach,
demonstrating substantial improvements in mean Average Precision (mAP) compared
to leading baselines.

Motivation: 长视频字幕生成面临ID-Matching挑战，即准确识别不同帧中出现的同一人物。现有方法泛化能力有限且依赖点对点匹配，效果不佳。

Method: 基于LVLMs构建RICE方法，通过增强图像信息利用和增加个体描述信息量两种方式来提升ID-Matching性能。

Result: 在GPT-4o上实现ID-Matching精度从50%提升至90%，召回率从15%提升至80%，能够持续跟踪长视频中的不同个体。

Conclusion: RICE方法有效解锁了LVLMs固有的ID-Matching能力，显著提升了长视频字幕生成中的人物身份识别性能。

Abstract: Generating captions for long and complex videos is both critical and
challenging, with significant implications for the growing fields of
text-to-video generation and multi-modal understanding. One key challenge in
long video captioning is accurately recognizing the same individuals who appear
in different frames, which we refer to as the ID-Matching problem. Few prior
works have focused on this important issue. Those that have, usually suffer
from limited generalization and depend on point-wise matching, which limits
their overall effectiveness. In this paper, unlike previous approaches, we
build upon LVLMs to leverage their powerful priors. We aim to unlock the
inherent ID-Matching capabilities within LVLMs themselves to enhance the
ID-Matching performance of captions. Specifically, we first introduce a new
benchmark for assessing the ID-Matching capabilities of video captions. Using
this benchmark, we investigate LVLMs containing GPT-4o, revealing key insights
that the performance of ID-Matching can be improved through two methods: 1)
enhancing the usage of image information and 2) increasing the quantity of
information of individual descriptions. Based on these insights, we propose a
novel video captioning method called Recognizing Identities for Captioning
Effectively (RICE). Extensive experiments including assessments of caption
quality and ID-Matching performance, demonstrate the superiority of our
approach. Notably, when implemented on GPT-4o, our RICE improves the precision
of ID-Matching from 50% to 90% and improves the recall of ID-Matching from 15%
to 80% compared to baseline. RICE makes it possible to continuously track
different individuals in the captions of long videos.

Conclusion: 该方法为运动适应提供了灵活、数据高效且保护隐私的解决方案

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced human motion generation, producing
realistic and diverse animations from textual prompts. However, adapting these
models to unseen actions or styles typically requires additional motion capture
data and full retraining, which is costly and difficult to scale. We propose a
post-training framework based on Reinforcement Learning that fine-tunes
pretrained motion diffusion models using only textual prompts, without
requiring any motion ground truth. Our approach employs a pretrained
text-motion retrieval network as a reward signal and optimizes the diffusion
policy with Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization, effectively shifting the
model's generative distribution toward the target domain without relying on
paired motion data. We evaluate our method on cross-dataset adaptation and
leave-one-out motion experiments using the HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets across
both latent- and joint-space diffusion architectures. Results from quantitative
metrics and user studies show that our approach consistently improves the
quality and diversity of generated motions, while preserving performance on the
original distribution. Our approach is a flexible, data-efficient, and
privacy-preserving solution for motion adaptation.

Result: 在包含47种作物类型和六年Sentinel-2采集数据的多年作物类型分类数据集上的验证表明，建模预测标签的时间一致性很重要，HMM提高了整体性能和F1分数。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法通过结合深度学习和贝叶斯建模，有效提升了年度卫星图像时间序列分类的性能和时间一致性。

Abstract: The temporal consistency of yearly land-cover maps is of great importance to
model the evolution and change of the land cover over the years. In this paper,
we focus the attention on a novel approach to classification of yearly
satellite image time series (SITS) that combines deep learning with Bayesian
modelling, using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) integrated with Transformer
Encoder (TE) based DNNs. The proposed approach aims to capture both i)
intricate temporal correlations in yearly SITS and ii) specific patterns in
multiyear crop type sequences. It leverages the cascade classification of an
HMM layer built on top of the TE, discerning consistent yearly crop-type
sequences. Validation on a multiyear crop type classification dataset spanning
47 crop types and six years of Sentinel-2 acquisitions demonstrates the
importance of modelling temporal consistency in the predicted labels. HMMs
enhance the overall performance and F1 scores, emphasising the effectiveness of
the proposed approach.

*Fenghe Tang,Chengqi Dong,Wenxin Ma,Zikang Xu,Heqin Zhu,Zihang Jiang,Rongsheng Wang,Yuhao Wang,Chenxu Wu,Shaohua Kevin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: U-Bench是首个大规模、统计严谨的基准测试，评估了100个U-Net变体在28个数据集和10种成像模态上的表现，从统计鲁棒性、零样本泛化能力和计算效率三个维度进行综合评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管U-Net在医学图像分割领域占据主导地位，但缺乏系统性的基准测试来评估各种变体的性能和实用性，主要原因是统计验证不足以及对效率和泛化能力的考虑有限。

Method: 开发了U-Bench基准测试，引入U-Score指标来联合捕捉性能-效率权衡，从三个关键维度评估模型：统计鲁棒性、零样本泛化和计算效率。

Result: 通过大规模评估总结了关键发现，系统分析了数据集特性和架构范式对模型性能的影响，并提出了模型顾问代理来指导研究人员选择最适合特定数据集和任务的模型。

Conclusion: U-Bench不仅揭示了先前评估中的差距，还为未来十年基于U-Net的分割模型建立了公平、可重现且具有实际相关性的基准测试基础。

Abstract: Over the past decade, U-Net has been the dominant architecture in medical
image segmentation, leading to the development of thousands of U-shaped
variants. Despite its widespread adoption, there is still no comprehensive
benchmark to systematically evaluate their performance and utility, largely
because of insufficient statistical validation and limited consideration of
efficiency and generalization across diverse datasets. To bridge this gap, we
present U-Bench, the first large-scale, statistically rigorous benchmark that
evaluates 100 U-Net variants across 28 datasets and 10 imaging modalities. Our
contributions are threefold: (1) Comprehensive Evaluation: U-Bench evaluates
models along three key dimensions: statistical robustness, zero-shot
generalization, and computational efficiency. We introduce a novel metric,
U-Score, which jointly captures the performance-efficiency trade-off, offering
a deployment-oriented perspective on model progress. (2) Systematic Analysis
and Model Selection Guidance: We summarize key findings from the large-scale
evaluation and systematically analyze the impact of dataset characteristics and
architectural paradigms on model performance. Based on these insights, we
propose a model advisor agent to guide researchers in selecting the most
suitable models for specific datasets and tasks. (3) Public Availability: We
provide all code, models, protocols, and weights, enabling the community to
reproduce our results and extend the benchmark with future methods. In summary,
U-Bench not only exposes gaps in previous evaluations but also establishes a
foundation for fair, reproducible, and practically relevant benchmarking in the
next decade of U-Net-based segmentation models. The project can be accessed at:

*Ori nizan,Oren Shrout,Ayellet Tal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于概念相似性的图像检索方法，超越了传统的视觉或语义相似性，专注于识别图像中的核心概念和叙事元素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像检索方法主要关注视觉或语义相似性，但无法有效捕捉图像背后的核心概念和叙事元素。本文旨在解决这一问题，通过概念相似性来检索共享相同中心概念的图像。

Method: 基于两个关键观察：(1) 嵌入空间中的邻居可能与查询共享至少一个概念，但不一定彼此共享相同概念；(2) 使用双峰高斯分布建模邻域结构有助于概念识别。

Result: 通过定性、定量和人工评估验证了方法的有效性，证明该方法能够有效识别和检索共享核心概念的图像。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在概念相似性图像检索方面表现出色，超越了传统方法，能够更好地捕捉图像背后的叙事元素和核心概念。

Abstract: A concept may reflect either a concrete or abstract idea. Given an input
image, this paper seeks to retrieve other images that share its central
concepts, capturing aspects of the underlying narrative. This goes beyond
conventional retrieval or clustering methods, which emphasize visual or
semantic similarity. We formally define the problem, outline key requirements,
and introduce appropriate evaluation metrics. We propose a novel approach
grounded in two key observations: (1) While each neighbor in the embedding
space typically shares at least one concept with the query, not all neighbors
necessarily share the same concept with one another. (2) Modeling this
neighborhood with a bimodal Gaussian distribution uncovers meaningful structure
that facilitates concept identification. Qualitative, quantitative, and human
evaluations confirm the effectiveness of our approach. See the package on PyPI:

TL;DR: DADO是一种结合注意力机制和深度模型的无监督物体发现方法，通过动态加权策略自适应处理不同图像特征，在标准基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无监督物体发现（无需人工标注识别和定位图像中的物体）是计算机视觉中的重要挑战，现有方法在噪声注意力图和多深度平面复杂场景中存在局限。

Method: 提出DADO模型，结合注意力机制和深度模型，使用动态加权策略根据图像全局特征自适应强调注意力或深度特征。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，DADO在物体发现准确性和鲁棒性方面优于最先进方法，且无需微调。

Conclusion: DADO通过有效结合注意力与深度信息，为无监督物体发现提供了更准确和鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised object discovery, the task of identifying and localizing objects
in images without human-annotated labels, remains a significant challenge and a
growing focus in computer vision. In this work, we introduce a novel model,
DADO (Depth-Attention self-supervised technique for Discovering unseen
Objects), which combines an attention mechanism and a depth model to identify
potential objects in images. To address challenges such as noisy attention maps
or complex scenes with varying depth planes, DADO employs dynamic weighting to
adaptively emphasize attention or depth features based on the global
characteristics of each image. We evaluated DADO on standard benchmarks, where
it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in object discovery accuracy and
robustness without the need for fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文针对无需显式概念标注的Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs)，发现CLIP在零样本概念提取中存在概念幻觉问题，提出了CHILI技术来抑制幻觉并生成更可解释的显著性解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于CLIP的CBMs存在概念幻觉问题，即错误预测图像中概念的存在与否，这削弱了解释的可靠性。

Method: 提出了CHILI技术，通过解耦图像嵌入并定位目标概念对应的像素来抑制概念幻觉，同时支持生成基于显著性的解释。

Result: CHILI能够有效抑制概念幻觉，提供更准确的概念预测和更可解释的显著性解释。

Conclusion: CHILI解决了CLIP在CBMs中的概念幻觉问题，提高了XAI系统的解释忠实度和可解释性。

Abstract: This paper addresses explainable AI (XAI) through the lens of Concept
Bottleneck Models (CBMs) that do not require explicit concept annotations,
relying instead on concepts extracted using CLIP in a zero-shot manner. We show
that CLIP, which is central in these techniques, is prone to concept
hallucination, incorrectly predicting the presence or absence of concepts
within an image in scenarios used in numerous CBMs, hence undermining the
faithfulness of explanations. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Concept
Hallucination Inhibition via Localized Interpretability (CHILI), a technique
that disentangles image embeddings and localizes pixels corresponding to target
concepts. Furthermore, our approach supports the generation of saliency-based
explanations that are more interpretable.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoRe是一种无需训练的单目几何优化方法，通过特征匹配和基于图的优化框架提升跨视角一致性并解决尺度模糊问题，同时改善3D重建和新视角合成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目3D基础模型为感知任务提供了可扩展的解决方案，但在跨视角一致性和尺度对齐方面存在局限性，需要改进以适用于更广泛的3D视觉应用。

Method: 使用特征匹配建立帧间对应关系，采用基于图的优化框架进行局部平面近似，利用单目基础模型估计的3D点和表面法向量，避免简单的最小二乘优化。

Result: MoRe方法不仅增强了3D重建质量，还显著改善了新视角合成效果，特别是在稀疏视角渲染场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: 提出的训练免费单目几何优化方法MoRe有效解决了单目几何先验中的尺度模糊问题，同时保持了底层3D结构，为3D视觉应用提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Monocular 3D foundation models offer an extensible solution for perception
tasks, making them attractive for broader 3D vision applications. In this
paper, we propose MoRe, a training-free Monocular Geometry Refinement method
designed to improve cross-view consistency and achieve scale alignment. To
induce inter-frame relationships, our method employs feature matching between
frames to establish correspondences. Rather than applying simple least squares
optimization on these matched points, we formulate a graph-based optimization
framework that performs local planar approximation using the estimated 3D
points and surface normals estimated by monocular foundation models. This
formulation addresses the scale ambiguity inherent in monocular geometric
priors while preserving the underlying 3D structure. We further demonstrate
that MoRe not only enhances 3D reconstruction but also improves novel view
synthesis, particularly in sparse view rendering scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究探讨联邦学习在医学影像中处理非独立同分布数据的有效性，通过模拟不同MRI强度归一化方法创建异构数据集，验证FL在脑肿瘤分割任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习在医学影像中面临的数据隐私、存储和传输挑战，同时应对非独立同分布数据对联邦学习效果的影响。

Method: 通过应用不同MRI强度归一化技术创建非独立同分布数据子集，使用这些子集训练和测试脑肿瘤分割模型，比较联邦学习与集中式训练的性能。

Result: 联邦学习方法对客户端间不一致归一化数据表现出韧性，达到92%的3D Dice分数，与使用所有数据的集中式模型性能相当。

Conclusion: 联邦学习是有效训练高性能模型而不违反数据隐私的解决方案，在医学应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has been increasingly applied in medical imaging, however,
it requires large amounts of data, which raises many challenges related to data
privacy, storage, and transfer. Federated learning (FL) is a training paradigm
that overcomes these issues, though its effectiveness may be reduced when
dealing with non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. This
study simulates non-IID conditions by applying different MRI intensity
normalization techniques to separate data subsets, reflecting a common cause of
heterogeneity. These subsets are then used for training and testing models for
brain tumor segmentation. The findings provide insights into the influence of
the MRI intensity normalization methods on segmentation models, both training
and inference. Notably, the FL methods demonstrated resilience to
inconsistently normalized data across clients, achieving the 3D Dice score of
92%, which is comparable to a centralized model (trained using all data). These
results indicate that FL is a solution to effectively train high-performing
models without violating data privacy, a crucial concern in medical
applications. The code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像具有固有结构特征（空间排列、形状、纹理），对诊断至关重要。现有扩散模型在缺乏语义结构的噪声潜在空间中操作，难以确保对生成内容的有意义控制。

Method: 使用基于图的对象级表示，生成对应图像中主要结构的图节点，包含个体特征和关系。通过transformer模块处理图表示，并利用文本条件机制集成到扩散模型中。

Result: 在真实世界组织病理学用例中评估，证明生成的数据可以可靠地替代标注的患者数据用于下游分割任务。

Conclusion: 图条件扩散方法能够实现医学图像的细粒度控制生成，生成的合成数据在分割任务中表现出与真实标注数据相当的实用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have set new
standards in high-quality image synthesis. Yet, controlled generation remains
challenging, particularly in sensitive areas such as medical imaging. Medical
images feature inherent structure such as consistent spatial arrangement, shape
or texture, all of which are critical for diagnosis. However, existing DPMs
operate in noisy latent spaces that lack semantic structure and strong priors,
making it difficult to ensure meaningful control over generated content. To
address this, we propose graph-based object-level representations for
Graph-Conditioned-Diffusion. Our approach generates graph nodes corresponding
to each major structure in the image, encapsulating their individual features
and relationships. These graph representations are processed by a transformer
module and integrated into a diffusion model via the text-conditioning
mechanism, enabling fine-grained control over generation. We evaluate this
approach using a real-world histopathology use case, demonstrating that our
generated data can reliably substitute for annotated patient data in downstream
segmentation tasks. The code is available here.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了首个针对遥感视觉语言模型(RSVLMs)的少样本适应基准测试，在10个遥感场景分类数据集上评估了5种少样本适应策略在3个不同骨干网络的RSVLMs上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然RSVLMs在大规模预训练后展现出强大的零样本性能，但它们在少样本学习等低数据场景下的泛化能力尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 构建了结构化的基准测试框架，在10个遥感场景分类数据集上应用5种常用的少样本适应策略，评估3个不同骨干网络的最先进RSVLMs。

Result: 研究发现，具有相似零样本性能的模型在少样本适应下表现出显著不同的行为，某些RSVLMs天生更适合这种适应。现有方法在性能上存在较大变异性，没有明确的优胜者。

Conclusion: 需要开发更鲁棒的、专门针对遥感领域的少样本适应方法。研究提供了可复现的基准测试框架和开源代码，以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Remote Sensing Vision-Language Models (RSVLMs) have shown remarkable
potential thanks to large-scale pretraining, achieving strong zero-shot
performance on various tasks. However, their ability to generalize in low-data
regimes, such as few-shot learning, remains insufficiently explored. In this
work, we present the first structured benchmark for evaluating few-shot
adaptation methods on RSVLMs. We conduct comprehensive experiments across ten
remote sensing scene classification datasets, applying five widely used
few-shot adaptation strategies to three state-of-the-art RSVLMs with varying
backbones. Our findings reveal that models with similar zero-shot performance
can exhibit markedly different behavior under few-shot adaptation, with some
RSVLMs being inherently more amenable to such adaptation than others. The
variability of performance and the absence of a clear winner among existing
methods highlight the need for the development of more robust methods for
few-shot adaptation tailored to RS. To facilitate future research, we provide a
reproducible benchmarking framework and open-source code to systematically
evaluate RSVLMs under few-shot conditions. The source code is publicly

Motivation: 现有基准测试主要评估MLLM的感知和推理能力，而非视觉token压缩技术，导致评估不准确，需要专门针对压缩任务的评估框架。

Method: 通过广泛实验观察当前基准的问题，引入数据过滤机制去噪现有基准，构建VTC-Bench评估框架来公平评估视觉token压缩方法。

Result: 发现简单图像下采样在多个基准上优于先进压缩方法，当前基准对视觉token压缩任务存在噪声，下采样可作为数据过滤器评估样本难度。

Conclusion: 需要专门针对视觉token压缩任务的评估框架，VTC-Bench通过数据过滤机制提供了更公平准确的评估方法。

Abstract: Recent endeavors to accelerate inference in Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) have primarily focused on visual token compression. The effectiveness
of these methods is typically assessed by measuring the accuracy drop on
established benchmarks, comparing model performance before and after
compression. However, these benchmarks are originally designed to assess the
perception and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, rather than to evaluate
compression techniques. As a result, directly applying them to visual token
compression introduces a task mismatch. Strikingly, our investigation reveals
that simple image downsampling consistently outperforms many advanced
compression methods across multiple widely used benchmarks. Through extensive
experiments, we make the following observations: (i) Current benchmarks are
noisy for the visual token compression task. (ii) Down-sampling is able to
serve as a data filter to evaluate the difficulty of samples in the visual
token compression task. Motivated by these findings, we introduce VTC-Bench, an
evaluation framework that incorporates a data filtering mechanism to denoise
existing benchmarks, thereby enabling fairer and more accurate assessment of
visual token compression methods. All data and code are available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成方法主要专注于前视图内的相机轨迹重定向，难以生成360度视角变化。本文专注于以人为中心的子领域，解决从单目视频生成同步多视角视频的挑战。

Method: 利用MVHumanNet数据集，使用来自定向部分点云的相机相关法线图作为条件信号，提出多视角以人为中心的视频扩散模型，融合参考视频、部分渲染和不同视角的信息。

Result: 在三个数据集上的广泛实验表明，MV-Performer在效果和鲁棒性方面达到了最先进水平，为以人为中心的4D新视角合成建立了强大模型。

Conclusion: MV-Performer通过创新的条件信号和扩散模型设计，成功实现了从单目视频生成同步360度新视角视频，在以人为中心的4D新视角合成领域取得了突破性进展。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video generation, powered by large-scale datasets and
diffusion techniques, have shown that video diffusion models can function as
implicit 4D novel view synthesizers. Nevertheless, current methods primarily
concentrate on redirecting camera trajectory within the front view while
struggling to generate 360-degree viewpoint changes. In this paper, we focus on
human-centric subdomain and present MV-Performer, an innovative framework for
creating synchronized novel view videos from monocular full-body captures. To
achieve a 360-degree synthesis, we extensively leverage the MVHumanNet dataset
and incorporate an informative condition signal. Specifically, we use the
camera-dependent normal maps rendered from oriented partial point clouds, which
effectively alleviate the ambiguity between seen and unseen observations. To
maintain synchronization in the generated videos, we propose a multi-view
human-centric video diffusion model that fuses information from the reference
video, partial rendering, and different viewpoints. Additionally, we provide a
robust inference procedure for in-the-wild video cases, which greatly mitigates
the artifacts induced by imperfect monocular depth estimation. Extensive
experiments on three datasets demonstrate our MV-Performer's state-of-the-art
effectiveness and robustness, setting a strong model for human-centric 4D novel
view synthesis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DINOv3在512x512分辨率下在胸部X光图像分类中表现最佳，相比DINOv2和ImageNet初始化有持续改进，但1024x1024分辨率无进一步增益。ConvNeXt-B骨干网络优于ViT-B/16，冻结的7B模型特征表现不如完全微调的小型模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估自监督学习（特别是DINOv3）在胸部X光图像分析中的价值，这是高容量成像模态，包含细粒度发现，但SSL在此领域的有效性尚不明确。

Method: 在7个数据集（n>814,000）上对DINOv3、DINOv2和ImageNet初始化进行基准测试，使用ViT-B/16和ConvNeXt-B骨干网络，评估224x224、512x512和1024x1024像素分辨率，并评估冻结的7B模型特征。

Result: 在512x512分辨率下，DINOv3持续优于DINOv2和ImageNet；ConvNeXt-B始终优于ViT-B/16；冻结的DINOv3-7B特征表现不如完全微调的86-89M参数骨干网络；1024x1024分辨率无进一步改进。

Conclusion: 在胸部X光分析中，512x512像素是实用上限，DINOv3初始化的ConvNeXt-B网络提供最强性能，更高分辨率成本效益低。临床应用中，完全微调的中型骨干网络在512x512分辨率下最适合胸部X光解读，对检测急诊和重症监护环境中相关细微或边界中心病变的增益最大。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has advanced visual representation learning,
but its value in chest radiography, a high-volume imaging modality with
fine-grained findings, remains unclear. Meta's DINOv3 extends earlier SSL
models through Gram-anchored self-distillation. Whether these design choices
improve transfer learning for chest radiography has not been systematically
tested. We benchmarked DINOv3 against DINOv2 and ImageNet initialization across
seven datasets (n>814,000). Two representative backbones were evaluated:
ViT-B/16 and ConvNeXt-B. Images were analyzed at 224x224, 512x512, and
1024x1024 pixels. We additionally assessed frozen features from a 7B model. The
primary outcome was mean AUROC across labels. At 224x224, DINOv3 and DINOv2
achieved comparable performance on adult datasets. Increasing resolution to
512x512 yielded consistent improvements for DINOv3 over both DINOv2 and
ImageNet. In contrast, results in pediatric cohort showed no differences across
initializations. Across all settings, ConvNeXt-B outperformed ViT-B/16. Models
using frozen DINOv3-7B features underperformed relative to fully finetuned
86-89M-parameter backbones, highlighting the importance of domain adaptation.
Scaling to 1024x1024 did not further improve accuracy. Resolution-related gains
were most evident for boundary-dependent and small focal abnormalities. In
chest radiography, higher input resolution is critical for leveraging the
benefits of modern self-supervised models. 512x512 pixels represent a practical
upper limit where DINOv3-initialized ConvNeXt-B networks provide the strongest
performance, while larger inputs offer minimal return on cost. Clinically,
these findings support use of finetuned, mid-sized backbones at 512x512 for
chest radiograph interpretation, with the greatest gains expected in detecting
subtle or boundary-centered lesions relevant to emergency and critical care
settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EigenScore是一种基于扩散模型后验协方差特征值谱的OOD检测方法，通过分析特征值谱的分布偏移信号来识别异常输入，在多个基准测试中达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在捕捉复杂数据分布方面表现出色，但其在OOD检测方面的潜力尚未充分探索。现有基于扩散的OOD检测方法在近OOD场景（如CIFAR-10 vs CIFAR-100）中表现不佳，需要更可靠的检测信号。

Method: 利用扩散模型诱导的后验协方差特征值谱，提出后验协方差可作为分布偏移的一致信号。采用无雅可比子空间迭代方法仅通过去噪器的前向评估来估计主要特征值，确保计算可行性。

Result: EigenScore在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，AUROC指标相比最佳基线提升高达5%。在近OOD场景中保持鲁棒性，而现有基于扩散的方法在此类场景中往往失效。

Conclusion: 后验协方差特征值谱为OOD检测提供了可靠信号，EigenScore方法在保持计算效率的同时实现了优异的检测性能，特别是在具有挑战性的近OOD场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for the safe deployment of
machine learning systems in safety-sensitive domains. Diffusion models have
recently emerged as powerful generative models, capable of capturing complex
data distributions through iterative denoising. Building on this progress,
recent work has explored their potential for OOD detection. We propose
EigenScore, a new OOD detection method that leverages the eigenvalue spectrum
of the posterior covariance induced by a diffusion model. We argue that
posterior covariance provides a consistent signal of distribution shift,
leading to larger trace and leading eigenvalues on OOD inputs, yielding a clear
spectral signature. We further provide analysis explicitly linking posterior
covariance to distribution mismatch, establishing it as a reliable signal for
OOD detection. To ensure tractability, we adopt a Jacobian-free subspace
iteration method to estimate the leading eigenvalues using only forward
evaluations of the denoiser. Empirically, EigenScore achieves SOTA performance,
with up to 5% AUROC improvement over the best baseline. Notably, it remains
robust in near-OOD settings such as CIFAR-10 vs CIFAR-100, where existing
diffusion-based methods often fail.

Abstract: Text-to-image synthesis has made remarkable progress, yet accurately
interpreting complex and lengthy prompts remains challenging, often resulting
in semantic inconsistencies and missing details. Existing solutions, such as
fine-tuning, are model-specific and require training, while prior automatic
prompt optimization (APO) approaches typically lack systematic error analysis
and refinement strategies, resulting in limited reliability and effectiveness.
Meanwhile, test-time scaling methods operate on fixed prompts and on noise or
sample numbers, limiting their interpretability and adaptability. To solve
these, we introduce a flexible and efficient test-time prompt optimization
strategy that operates directly on the input text. We propose a plug-and-play
multi-agent system called GenPilot, integrating error analysis,
clustering-based adaptive exploration, fine-grained verification, and a memory
module for iterative optimization. Our approach is model-agnostic,
interpretable, and well-suited for handling long and complex prompts.
Simultaneously, we summarize the common patterns of errors and the refinement
strategy, offering more experience and encouraging further exploration.
Experiments on DPG-bench and Geneval with improvements of up to 16.9% and 5.7%
demonstrate the strong capability of our methods in enhancing the text and
image consistency and structural coherence of generated images, revealing the
effectiveness of our test-time prompt optimization strategy. The code is

TL;DR: TalkCuts是一个大规模多镜头人类语音视频数据集，包含164k个视频片段（500+小时），涵盖多种镜头类型和详细标注。作者提出了Orator框架作为基准，通过LLM指导生成连贯的多镜头语音视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集主要关注单镜头静态视角，缺乏多镜头语音视频生成的研究资源。需要大规模、多样化的数据集来支持可控的多镜头语音视频生成研究。

Method: 构建TalkCuts数据集，包含164k个视频片段、详细文本描述、2D关键点和3D SMPL-X运动标注。提出Orator框架，使用LLM作为多面导演，协调摄像机转换、说话者姿态和声音调制，通过多模态视频生成模块合成连贯长视频。

Result: 在姿态引导和音频驱动设置下的广泛实验表明，在TalkCuts上训练显著提高了生成多镜头语音视频的电影连贯性和视觉吸引力。

Conclusion: TalkCuts为可控多镜头语音视频生成和更广泛的多模态学习提供了坚实基础，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: In this work, we present TalkCuts, a large-scale dataset designed to
facilitate the study of multi-shot human speech video generation. Unlike
existing datasets that focus on single-shot, static viewpoints, TalkCuts offers
164k clips totaling over 500 hours of high-quality human speech videos with
diverse camera shots, including close-up, half-body, and full-body views. The
dataset includes detailed textual descriptions, 2D keypoints and 3D SMPL-X
motion annotations, covering over 10k identities, enabling multimodal learning
and evaluation. As a first attempt to showcase the value of the dataset, we
present Orator, an LLM-guided multi-modal generation framework as a simple
baseline, where the language model functions as a multi-faceted director,
orchestrating detailed specifications for camera transitions, speaker
gesticulations, and vocal modulation. This architecture enables the synthesis
of coherent long-form videos through our integrated multi-modal video
generation module. Extensive experiments in both pose-guided and audio-driven
settings show that training on TalkCuts significantly enhances the
cinematographic coherence and visual appeal of generated multi-shot speech
videos. We believe TalkCuts provides a strong foundation for future work in
controllable, multi-shot speech video generation and broader multimodal
learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 比较基础模型与标准迁移学习方法在糖尿病黄斑水肿检测任务中的表现，发现基础模型并不总是优于微调的CNN，轻量级CNN在数据稀缺环境中仍然是强基线


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病黄斑水肿是导致糖尿病患者视力丧失的主要原因，虽然深度学习在自动检测方面显示出潜力，但标注数据有限。基础模型作为替代解决方案出现，但尚不清楚它们是否能应对DME检测任务

Method: 系统比较了两种最流行的视网膜图像基础模型（RETFound和FLAIR）与EfficientNet-B0骨干网络，在不同训练机制和评估设置下进行测试，使用IDRiD、MESSIDOR-2和OCT-and-Eye-Fundus-Images数据集

Result: 尽管基础模型规模庞大，但在DME检测任务中并不始终优于微调的CNN。EfficientNet-B0在大多数评估设置中在ROC和精确度/召回率曲线下面积方面排名第一或第二，RETFound仅在OEFI数据集上显示出有希望的结果，FLAIR在零样本性能方面表现出竞争力

Conclusion: 基础模型可能不是细粒度眼科任务（如DME检测）的好工具，即使经过微调，轻量级CNN在数据稀缺环境中仍然是强基线

Abstract: Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) is a leading cause of vision loss among patients
with Diabetic Retinopathy (DR). While deep learning has shown promising results
for automatically detecting this condition from fundus images, its application
remains challenging due the limited availability of annotated data. Foundation
Models (FM) have emerged as an alternative solution. However, it is unclear if
they can cope with DME detection in particular. In this paper, we
systematically compare different FM and standard transfer learning approaches
for this task. Specifically, we compare the two most popular FM for retinal
images--RETFound and FLAIR--and an EfficientNet-B0 backbone, across different
training regimes and evaluation settings in IDRiD, MESSIDOR-2 and
OCT-and-Eye-Fundus-Images (OEFI). Results show that despite their scale, FM do
not consistently outperform fine-tuned CNNs in this task. In particular, an
EfficientNet-B0 ranked first or second in terms of area under the ROC and
precision/recall curves in most evaluation settings, with RETFound only showing
promising results in OEFI. FLAIR, on the other hand, demonstrated competitive
zero-shot performance, achieving notable AUC-PR scores when prompted
appropriately. These findings reveal that FM might not be a good tool for
fine-grained ophthalmic tasks such as DME detection even after fine-tuning,
suggesting that lightweight CNNs remain strong baselines in data-scarce
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有水印方法对各种变换（包括失真、图像再生和对抗性扰动）缺乏鲁棒性，在现实应用中面临挑战。

Method: 将空间域转换为频域，通过小波投影分解高频带进行谱投影，使用快速傅里叶变换近似。编码阶段使用强度因子增强对各种攻击的抵抗力，解码器利用Parseval定理学习和提取水印模式。

Result: 综合实验表明SpecGuard在不可见性、容量和鲁棒性方面优于最先进模型。

Conclusion: SpecGuard提供了一种有效的水印解决方案，能够抵抗多种攻击并保持版权信息的完整性。

Abstract: Watermarking embeds imperceptible patterns into images for authenticity
verification. However, existing methods often lack robustness against various
transformations primarily including distortions, image regeneration, and
adversarial perturbation, creating real-world challenges. In this work, we
introduce SpecGuard, a novel watermarking approach for robust and invisible
image watermarking. Unlike prior approaches, we embed the message inside hidden
convolution layers by converting from the spatial domain to the frequency
domain using spectral projection of a higher frequency band that is decomposed
by wavelet projection. Spectral projection employs Fast Fourier Transform
approximation to transform spatial data into the frequency domain efficiently.
In the encoding phase, a strength factor enhances resilience against diverse
attacks, including adversarial, geometric, and regeneration-based distortions,
ensuring the preservation of copyrighted information. Meanwhile, the decoder
leverages Parseval's theorem to effectively learn and extract the watermark
pattern, enabling accurate retrieval under challenging transformations. We
evaluate the proposed SpecGuard based on the embedded watermark's invisibility,
capacity, and robustness. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the proposed
SpecGuard outperforms the state-of-the-art models. To ensure reproducibility,
the full code is released on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频DiTs模型在多实例或主体-客体交互建模方面存在困难，需要深入理解这些模型如何内部表示交互关系。

Method: 构建MATRIX-11K视频数据集，包含交互感知标注和多实例掩码轨迹；提出MATRIX正则化方法，在特定层中对齐注意力与掩码轨迹；设计InterGenEval评估协议。

Result: MATRIX方法提高了交互保真度和语义对齐，减少了漂移和幻觉现象，实验验证了设计选择的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过注意力对齐的简单正则化方法可以显著提升视频DiTs模型的交互建模能力，为理解模型内部表示提供了系统性分析框架。

Abstract: Video DiTs have advanced video generation, yet they still struggle to model
multi-instance or subject-object interactions. This raises a key question: How
do these models internally represent interactions? To answer this, we curate
MATRIX-11K, a video dataset with interaction-aware captions and multi-instance
mask tracks. Using this dataset, we conduct a systematic analysis that
formalizes two perspectives of video DiTs: semantic grounding, via
video-to-text attention, which evaluates whether noun and verb tokens capture
instances and their relations; and semantic propagation, via video-to-video
attention, which assesses whether instance bindings persist across frames. We
find both effects concentrate in a small subset of interaction-dominant layers.
Motivated by this, we introduce MATRIX, a simple and effective regularization
that aligns attention in specific layers of video DiTs with multi-instance mask
tracks from the MATRIX-11K dataset, enhancing both grounding and propagation.
We further propose InterGenEval, an evaluation protocol for interaction-aware
video generation. In experiments, MATRIX improves both interaction fidelity and
semantic alignment while reducing drift and hallucination. Extensive ablations
validate our design choices. Codes and weights will be released.

Motivation: 解决现有生成式深度估计模型因使用VAE压缩深度图到潜在空间而导致的边缘和细节处飞行像素问题。

Method: 1) 语义提示扩散变换器(SP-DiT)：将视觉基础模型的语义表示融入DiT以提示扩散过程；2) 级联DiT设计：逐步增加token数量提升效率与精度。

Result: 在五个基准测试中达到所有已发布生成模型的最佳性能，在边缘感知点云评估中显著优于其他模型。

Conclusion: 通过像素空间直接扩散生成和创新的SP-DiT与级联设计，成功解决了飞行像素问题，实现了高质量的深度估计。

Abstract: This paper presents Pixel-Perfect Depth, a monocular depth estimation model
based on pixel-space diffusion generation that produces high-quality,
flying-pixel-free point clouds from estimated depth maps. Current generative
depth estimation models fine-tune Stable Diffusion and achieve impressive
performance. However, they require a VAE to compress depth maps into latent
space, which inevitably introduces \textit{flying pixels} at edges and details.
Our model addresses this challenge by directly performing diffusion generation
in the pixel space, avoiding VAE-induced artifacts. To overcome the high
complexity associated with pixel-space generation, we introduce two novel
designs: 1) Semantics-Prompted Diffusion Transformers (SP-DiT), which
incorporate semantic representations from vision foundation models into DiT to
prompt the diffusion process, thereby preserving global semantic consistency
while enhancing fine-grained visual details; and 2) Cascade DiT Design that
progressively increases the number of tokens to further enhance efficiency and
accuracy. Our model achieves the best performance among all published
generative models across five benchmarks, and significantly outperforms all
other models in edge-aware point cloud evaluation.

Abstract: Quantum-enhanced Computer Vision (QeCV) is a new research field at the
intersection of computer vision, optimisation theory, machine learning and
quantum computing. It has high potential to transform how visual signals are
processed and interpreted with the help of quantum computing that leverages
quantum-mechanical effects in computations inaccessible to classical (i.e.
non-quantum) computers. In scenarios where existing non-quantum methods cannot
find a solution in a reasonable time or compute only approximate solutions,
quantum computers can provide, among others, advantages in terms of better time
scalability for multiple problem classes. Parametrised quantum circuits can
also become, in the long term, a considerable alternative to classical neural
networks in computer vision. However, specialised and fundamentally new
algorithms must be developed to enable compatibility with quantum hardware and
unveil the potential of quantum computational paradigms in computer vision.
This survey contributes to the existing literature on QeCV with a holistic
review of this research field. It is designed as a quantum computing reference
for the computer vision community, targeting computer vision students,
scientists and readers with related backgrounds who want to familiarise
themselves with QeCV. We provide a comprehensive introduction to QeCV, its
specifics, and methodologies for formulations compatible with quantum hardware
and QeCV methods, leveraging two main quantum computational paradigms, i.e.
gate-based quantum computing and quantum annealing. We elaborate on the
operational principles of quantum computers and the available tools to access,
program and simulate them in the context of QeCV. Finally, we review existing
quantum computing tools and learning materials and discuss aspects related to
publishing and reviewing QeCV papers, open challenges and potential social
implications.

Motivation: 重新思考RVOS任务，探索其关键因素。现有方法需要端到端训练和密集掩码标注，计算量大且可扩展性差。

Method: 将RVOS分解为参考、视频和分割三个因素，提出时间提示生成和选择框架，利用现成目标检测器和跟踪器生成时间提示，并通过提示偏好学习评估提示质量。

Result: 在RVOS基准测试中证明了Tenet框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过时间提示生成和选择，能够高效地将基于图像的基础分割模型适配到参考视频对象分割任务。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment the object
referred to by the query sentence in the video. Most existing methods require
end-to-end training with dense mask annotations, which could be
computation-consuming and less scalable. In this work, we rethink the RVOS
problem and aim to investigate the key to this task. Based on existing
foundation segmentation models, we decompose the RVOS task into referring,
video, and segmentation factors, and propose a Temporal Prompt Generation and
Selection (Tenet) framework to address the referring and video factors while
leaving the segmentation problem to foundation models. To efficiently adapt
image-based foundation segmentation models to referring video object
segmentation, we leverage off-the-shelf object detectors and trackers to
produce temporal prompts associated with the referring sentence. While
high-quality temporal prompts could be produced, they can not be easily
identified from confidence scores. To tackle this issue, we propose Prompt
Preference Learning to evaluate the quality of the produced temporal prompts.
By taking such prompts to instruct image-based foundation segmentation models,
we would be able to produce high-quality masks for the referred object,
enabling efficient model adaptation to referring video object segmentation.
Experiments on RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the Tenet
framework.

TL;DR: Vi-TacMan结合视觉和触觉进行铰接物体操作：视觉提供抓取建议和粗略方向，触觉控制器进行精确执行，无需显式运动学模型。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决铰接物体自主操作的挑战，视觉方法对陌生物体估计不精确，触觉方法需要准确初始化，需要结合两者的互补优势。

Method: 使用视觉提出抓取和粗略方向作为种子，触觉控制器通过实时接触调节来细化视觉估计，结合表面法线作为几何先验，使用von Mises-Fisher分布建模方向。

Result: 在超过50,000个模拟和真实世界物体上测试，显著优于基线方法（所有p<0.0001），实现跨类别的鲁棒泛化。

Conclusion: 粗视觉线索结合触觉反馈足以实现可靠操作，为非结构化环境中的自主系统提供了可扩展的范式。

Abstract: Autonomous manipulation of articulated objects remains a fundamental
challenge for robots in human environments. Vision-based methods can infer
hidden kinematics but can yield imprecise estimates on unfamiliar objects.
Tactile approaches achieve robust control through contact feedback but require
accurate initialization. This suggests a natural synergy: vision for global
guidance, touch for local precision. Yet no framework systematically exploits
this complementarity for generalized articulated manipulation. Here we present
Vi-TacMan, which uses vision to propose grasps and coarse directions that seed
a tactile controller for precise execution. By incorporating surface normals as
geometric priors and modeling directions via von Mises-Fisher distributions,
our approach achieves significant gains over baselines (all p<0.0001).
Critically, manipulation succeeds without explicit kinematic models -- the
tactile controller refines coarse visual estimates through real-time contact
regulation. Tests on more than 50,000 simulated and diverse real-world objects
confirm robust cross-category generalization. This work establishes that coarse
visual cues suffice for reliable manipulation when coupled with tactile
feedback, offering a scalable paradigm for autonomous systems in unstructured
environments.

Result: 通过四旋翼飞行器参数不确定性的在线双控制仿真案例研究验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架能够在保证安全的前提下，智能地选择有益的探索时机，实现不确定性的主动减少和任务成本的优化。

Abstract: Planning safe trajectories under model uncertainty is a fundamental
challenge. Robust planning ensures safety by considering worst-case
realizations, yet ignores uncertainty reduction and leads to overly
conservative behavior. Actively reducing uncertainty on-the-fly during a
nominal mission defines the dual control problem. Most approaches address this
by adding a weighted exploration term to the cost, tuned to trade off the
nominal objective and uncertainty reduction, but without formal consideration
of when exploration is beneficial. Moreover, safety is enforced in some methods
but not in others. We propose a framework that integrates robust planning with
active exploration under formal guarantees as follows: The key innovation and
contribution is that exploration is pursued only when it provides a verifiable
improvement without compromising safety. To achieve this, we utilize our
earlier work on gatekeeper as an architecture for safety verification, and
extend it so that it generates both safe and informative trajectories that
reduce uncertainty and the cost of the mission, or keep it within a
user-defined budget. The methodology is evaluated via simulation case studies
on the online dual control of a quadrotor under parametric uncertainty.

Abstract: Replicating human-level intelligence in the execution of embodied tasks
remains challenging due to the unconstrained nature of real-world environments.
Novel use of large language models (LLMs) for task planning seeks to address
the previously intractable state/action space of complex planning tasks, but
hallucinations limit their reliability, and thus, viability beyond a research
context. Additionally, the prompt engineering required to achieve adequate
system performance lacks transparency, and thus, repeatability. In contrast to
LLM planning, symbolic planning methods offer strong reliability and
repeatability guarantees, but struggle to scale to the complexity and ambiguity
of real-world tasks. We introduce a new robotic planning method that augments
LLM planners with symbolic planning oversight to improve reliability and
repeatability, and provide a transparent approach to defining hard constraints
with considerably stronger clarity than traditional prompt engineering.
Importantly, these augmentations preserve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs
and retain impressive generalization in open-world environments. We demonstrate
our approach in simulated and real-world environments. On the ALFWorld planning
benchmark, our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving
a near-perfect 99% success rate. Deployment of our method to a real-world
quadruped robot resulted in 100% task success compared to 50% and 30% for pure
LLM and symbolic planners across embodied pick and place tasks. Our approach
presents an effective strategy to enhance the reliability, repeatability and
transparency of LLM-based robot planners while retaining their key strengths:
flexibility and generalizability to complex real-world environments. We hope
that this work will contribute to the broad goal of building resilient embodied
intelligent systems.

Abstract: Safe navigation in uncertain environments requires planning methods that
integrate risk aversion with active perception. In this work, we present a
unified framework that refines a coarse reference path by constructing
tail-sensitive risk maps from Average Value-at-Risk statistics on an
online-updated 3D Gaussian-splat Radiance Field. These maps enable the
generation of locally safe and feasible trajectories. In parallel, we formulate
Next-Best-View (NBV) selection as an optimization problem on the SE(3) pose
manifold, where Riemannian gradient descent maximizes an expected information
gain objective to reduce uncertainty most critical for imminent motion. Our
approach advances the state-of-the-art by coupling risk-averse path refinement
with NBV planning, while introducing scalable gradient decompositions that
support efficient online updates in complex environments. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework through extensive computational
studies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有潜在空间安全控制方法假设安全关键特征可在学习到的潜在状态中观测到，但实际中RGB观测可能无法充分捕捉某些安全相关特征（如温度），导致短视的安全行为。

Method: 引入基于互信息的度量来预测观测是否捕获安全相关特征；提出多模态监督训练策略，在训练时使用额外传感器输入塑造潜在状态，但部署时无需额外模态。

Result: 在仿真和Franka Research 3机械臂硬件实验中验证了方法有效性，成功防止蜡锅过热。

Conclusion: 仅依赖RGB观测的潜在空间安全控制可能不足，需要确保潜在状态包含所有安全相关特征；多模态监督训练可在不增加部署成本的情况下改善安全性能。

Abstract: Safe control techniques, such as Hamilton-Jacobi reachability, provide
principled methods for synthesizing safety-preserving robot policies but
typically assume hand-designed state spaces and full observability. Recent work
has relaxed these assumptions via latent-space safe control, where state
representations and dynamics are learned jointly through world models that
reconstruct future high-dimensional observations (e.g., RGB images) from
current observations and actions. This enables safety constraints that are
difficult to specify analytically (e.g., spilling) to be framed as
classification problems in latent space, allowing controllers to operate
directly from raw observations. However, these methods assume that
safety-critical features are observable in the learned latent state. We ask:
when are latent state spaces sufficient for safe control? To study this, we
examine temperature-based failures, comparable to overheating in cooking or
manufacturing tasks, and find that RGB-only observations can produce myopic
safety behaviors, e.g., avoiding seeing failure states rather than preventing
failure itself. To predict such behaviors, we introduce a mutual
information-based measure that identifies when observations fail to capture
safety-relevant features. Finally, we propose a multimodal-supervised training
strategy that shapes the latent state with additional sensory inputs during
training, but requires no extra modalities at deployment, and validate our
approach in simulation and on hardware with a Franka Research 3 manipulator
preventing a pot of wax from overheating.

Abstract: Autonomous aerial robots are increasingly being deployed in real-world
scenarios, where transparent obstacles present significant challenges to
reliable navigation and mapping. These materials pose a unique problem for
traditional perception systems because they lack discernible features and can
cause conventional depth sensors to fail, leading to inaccurate maps and
potential collisions. To ensure safe navigation, robots must be able to
accurately detect and map these transparent obstacles. Existing methods often
rely on large, expensive sensors or algorithms that impose high computational
burdens, making them unsuitable for low Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) robots.
In this work, we propose a novel and computationally efficient framework for
detecting and mapping transparent obstacles onboard a sub-300g quadrotor. Our
method fuses data from a Time-of-Flight (ToF) camera and an ultrasonic sensor
with a custom, lightweight 2D convolution model. This specialized approach
accurately detects specular reflections and propagates their depth into
corresponding empty regions of the depth map, effectively rendering transparent
obstacles visible. The entire pipeline operates in real-time, utilizing only a
small fraction of a CPU core on an embedded processor. We validate our system
through a series of experiments in both controlled and real-world environments,
demonstrating the utility of our method through experiments where the robot
maps indoor environments containing glass. Our work is, to our knowledge, the
first of its kind to demonstrate a real-time, onboard transparent obstacle
mapping system on a low-SWaP quadrotor using only the CPU.

TL;DR: RAISE是一个自主机器人实验室系统，能够通过贝叶斯优化自动优化液体配方并评估表面润湿性，实现配方与接触角测量的闭环连接。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表面润湿性是生物医学设备、涂层和纺织品的关键设计参数，但液体配方对接触角测量有显著影响，需要高效的系统来优化配方。

Method: 开发了RAISE系统，包含液体混合、液滴转移、自动图像采集和接触角测量的全自动化流程，并与贝叶斯优化客户端集成进行迭代配方探索。

Result: 系统测量速度约为每分钟1个接触角测量，成功展示了表面活性剂润湿性探索和可调配方开发，多目标优化能根据特定应用目标找到精确配方。

Conclusion: RAISE能够自主地将液体配方与接触角测量联系起来，使用多目标贝叶斯优化高效识别符合研究人员定义标准的最佳配方。

Abstract: Surface wettability is a critical design parameter for biomedical devices,
coatings, and textiles. Contact angle measurements quantify liquid-surface
interactions, which depend strongly on liquid formulation. Herein, we present
the Robotic Autonomous Imaging Surface Evaluator (RAISE), a closed-loop,
self-driving laboratory that is capable of linking liquid formulation
optimization with surface wettability assessment. RAISE comprises a full
experimental orchestrator with the ability of mixing liquid ingredients to
create varying formulation cocktails, transferring droplets of prepared
formulations to a high-throughput stage, and using a pick-and-place camera tool
for automated droplet image capture. The system also includes an automated
image processing pipeline to measure contact angles. This closed loop
experiment orchestrator is integrated with a Bayesian Optimization (BO) client,
which enables iterative exploration of new formulations based on previous
contact angle measurements to meet user-defined objectives. The system operates
in a high-throughput manner and can achieve a measurement rate of approximately
1 contact angle measurement per minute. Here we demonstrate RAISE can be used
to explore surfactant wettability and how surfactant combinations create
tunable formulations that compensate for purity-related variations.
Furthermore, multi-objective BO demonstrates how precise and optimal
formulations can be reached based on application-specific goals. The
optimization is guided by a desirability score, which prioritizes formulations
that are within target contact angle ranges, minimize surfactant usage and
reduce cost. This work demonstrates the capabilities of RAISE to autonomously
link liquid formulations to contact angle measurements in a closed-loop system,
using multi-objective BO to efficiently identify optimal formulations aligned
with researcher-defined criteria.

Motivation: 空间碎片捕获任务需要机械臂同时跟踪非合作目标上的捕获点、避免自碰撞和意外接触，传统方法难以处理这些复杂约束。

Method: 使用TD3强化学习算法，构建基于课程学习的多批评家网络（一个关注精确跟踪，另一个负责碰撞避免），并结合优先级经验回放缓冲区。

Result: 在Matlab/Simulink中模拟的七自由度KUKA LBR iiwa机械臂上验证，能够生成安全自适应的碎片清除轨迹。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够有效解决空间机械臂在碎片捕获任务中的复杂约束问题，实现安全可靠的轨迹规划。

Abstract: The objective of this study is to develop a model-free workspace trajectory
planner for space manipulators using a Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy
Gradient (TD3) agent to enable safe and reliable debris capture. A local
control strategy with singularity avoidance and manipulability enhancement is
employed to ensure stable execution. The manipulator must simultaneously track
a capture point on a non-cooperative target, avoid self-collisions, and prevent
unintended contact with the target. To address these challenges, we propose a
curriculum-based multi-critic network where one critic emphasizes accurate
tracking and the other enforces collision avoidance. A prioritized experience
replay buffer is also used to accelerate convergence and improve policy
robustness. The framework is evaluated on a simulated seven-degree-of-freedom
KUKA LBR iiwa mounted on a free-floating base in Matlab/Simulink, demonstrating
safe and adaptive trajectory generation for debris removal missions.

Abstract: People living with dementia (PLWDs) face progressively declining abilities in
medication management-from simple forgetfulness to complete task breakdown-yet
most assistive technologies fail to adapt to these changing needs. This
one-size-fits-all approach undermines autonomy, accelerates dependence, and
increases caregiver burden. Occupational therapy principles emphasize matching
assistance levels to individual capabilities: minimal reminders for those who
merely forget, spatial guidance for those who misplace items, and comprehensive
multimodal support for those requiring step-by-step instruction. However,
existing robotic systems lack this adaptive, graduated response framework
essential for maintaining PLWD independence. We present an adaptive multimodal
robotic framework using the Pepper robot that dynamically adjusts assistance
based on real-time assessment of user needs. Our system implements a
hierarchical intervention model progressing from (1) simple verbal reminders,
to (2) verbal + gestural cues, to (3) full multimodal guidance combining
physical navigation to medication locations with step-by-step verbal and
gestural instructions. Powered by LLM-driven interaction strategies and
multimodal sensing, the system continuously evaluates task states to provide
just-enough assistance-preserving autonomy while ensuring medication adherence.
We conducted a preliminary study with healthy adults and dementia care
stakeholders in a controlled lab setting, evaluating the system's usability,
comprehensibility, and appropriateness of adaptive feedback mechanisms. This
work contributes: (1) a theoretically grounded adaptive assistance framework
translating occupational therapy principles into HRI design, (2) a multimodal
robotic implementation that preserves PLWD dignity through graduated support,
and (3) empirical insights into stakeholder perceptions of adaptive robotic
care.

TL;DR: RLinf-VLA是一个统一的强化学习框架，用于训练视觉-语言-动作模型，解决了现有方法在分布偏移下泛化能力差的问题，并在仿真和真实机器人上展示了优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言-动作模型大多使用监督微调训练，在分布偏移下泛化能力差。强化学习虽然能直接优化任务性能，但缺乏统一的平台进行公平系统比较。

Method: 提出RLinf-VLA框架，采用灵活的资源分配设计，支持多种VLA架构、RL算法和仿真器，并实现了混合细粒度流水线分配模式以加速训练。

Result: 在130个LIBERO任务上达到98.11%成功率，在25个ManiSkill任务上达到97.66%成功率。真实机器人部署显示RL训练策略比SFT具有更强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: RLinf-VLA为具身智能研究提供了加速和标准化的基础，并总结了RL应用于VLA训练的最佳实践。

Abstract: Recent progress in vision and language foundation models has significantly
advanced multimodal understanding, reasoning, and generation, inspiring a surge
of interest in extending such capabilities to embodied settings through
vision-language-action (VLA) models. Yet, most VLA models are still trained
with supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which struggles to generalize under
distribution shifts due to error accumulation. Reinforcement learning (RL)
offers a promising alternative by directly optimizing task performance through
interaction, but existing attempts remain fragmented and lack a unified
platform for fair and systematic comparison across model architectures and
algorithmic designs. To address this gap, we introduce RLinf-VLA, a unified and
efficient framework for scalable RL training of VLA models. The system adopts a
highly flexible resource allocation design that addresses the challenge of
integrating rendering, training, and inference in RL+VLA training. In
particular, for GPU-parallelized simulators, RLinf-VLA implements a novel
hybrid fine-grained pipeline allocation mode, achieving a 1.61x-1.88x speedup
in training. Through a unified interface, RLinf-VLA seamlessly supports diverse
VLA architectures (e.g., OpenVLA, OpenVLA-OFT), multiple RL algorithms (e.g.,
PPO, GRPO), and various simulators (e.g., ManiSkill, LIBERO). In simulation, a
unified model achieves 98.11\% across 130 LIBERO tasks and 97.66\% across 25
ManiSkill tasks. Beyond empirical performance, our study distills a set of best
practices for applying RL to VLA training and sheds light on emerging patterns
in this integration. Furthermore, we present preliminary deployment on a
real-world Franka robot, where RL-trained policies exhibit stronger
generalization than those trained with SFT. We envision RLinf-VLA as a
foundation to accelerate and standardize research on embodied intelligence.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在自动驾驶决策中应用广泛，但由于可能产生幻觉且缺乏车辆动力学集成，无法确保决策安全性。

Method: 首先全面描述驾驶场景，提示大语言模型生成并排序可行驾驶动作；然后将动作转换为包含形式化交通规则的时序逻辑公式；最后通过可达性分析消除不安全动作。

Result: 在开环和闭环驾驶环境中验证，该框架能够提供可证明的安全驾驶动作，并在可能时确保合法合规，即使在交通密集条件下也有效。

Conclusion: SanDRA是首个使用可达性分析的大语言模型安全决策框架，能够确保自动驾驶决策的安全性，所有代码和实验设置已公开。

Abstract: Large language models have been widely applied to knowledge-driven
decision-making for automated vehicles due to their strong generalization and
reasoning capabilities. However, the safety of the resulting decisions cannot
be ensured due to possible hallucinations and the lack of integrated vehicle
dynamics. To address this issue, we propose SanDRA, the first safe
large-language-model-based decision making framework for automated vehicles
using reachability analysis. Our approach starts with a comprehensive
description of the driving scenario to prompt large language models to generate
and rank feasible driving actions. These actions are translated into temporal
logic formulas that incorporate formalized traffic rules, and are subsequently
integrated into reachability analysis to eliminate unsafe actions. We validate
our approach in both open-loop and closed-loop driving environments using
off-the-shelf and finetuned large language models, showing that it can provide
provably safe and, where possible, legally compliant driving actions, even
under high-density traffic conditions. To ensure transparency and facilitate
future research, all code and experimental setups are publicly available at

Motivation: 在非结构化和复杂环境中，机器人需要全面理解3D场景的视觉、几何和语义信息，并评估感知信息的可靠性以做出稳健决策。现有方法存在场景特定性和缺乏不确定性建模的局限性。

Method: 提出基于体素的统一不确定性感知神经特征场，增量整合RGB-D图像到特征表示中，同时更新不确定性估计。该方法可零样本应用于新环境。

Result: 评估显示不确定性估计能准确描述场景重建和语义特征预测中的模型预测误差。在移动操作机器人的主动物体搜索任务中成功利用了特征预测及其不确定性。

Conclusion: UniFField能够实现稳健决策，为机器人任务提供了可靠的不确定性感知特征表示。

Abstract: Comprehensive visual, geometric, and semantic understanding of a 3D scene is
crucial for successful execution of robotic tasks, especially in unstructured
and complex environments. Additionally, to make robust decisions, it is
necessary for the robot to evaluate the reliability of perceived information.
While recent advances in 3D neural feature fields have enabled robots to
leverage features from pretrained foundation models for tasks such as
language-guided manipulation and navigation, existing methods suffer from two
critical limitations: (i) they are typically scene-specific, and (ii) they lack
the ability to model uncertainty in their predictions. We present UniFField, a
unified uncertainty-aware neural feature field that combines visual, semantic,
and geometric features in a single generalizable representation while also
predicting uncertainty in each modality. Our approach, which can be applied
zero shot to any new environment, incrementally integrates RGB-D images into
our voxel-based feature representation as the robot explores the scene,
simultaneously updating uncertainty estimation. We evaluate our uncertainty
estimations to accurately describe the model prediction errors in scene
reconstruction and semantic feature prediction. Furthermore, we successfully
leverage our feature predictions and their respective uncertainty for an active
object search task using a mobile manipulator robot, demonstrating the
capability for robust decision-making.

Abstract: This paper presents a geometric control framework on the Lie group SO(3) for
3D source-seeking by robots with first-order attitude dynamics and constant
translational speed. By working directly on SO(3), the approach avoids
Euler-angle singularities and quaternion ambiguities, providing a unique,
intrinsic representation of orientation. We design a proportional feed-forward
controller that ensures exponential alignment of each agent to an estimated
ascending direction toward a 3D scalar field source. The controller adapts to
bounded unknown variations and preserves well-posed swarm formations. Numerical
simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, with all code provided

Abstract: Kirigami, the traditional paper-cutting craft, holds immense potential for
revolutionizing robotics by providing multifunctional, lightweight, and
adaptable solutions. Kirigami structures, characterized by their
bending-dominated deformation, offer resilience to tensile forces and
facilitate shape morphing under small actuation forces. Kirigami components
such as actuators, sensors, batteries, controllers, and body structures can be
tailored to specific robotic applications by optimizing cut patterns. Actuators
based on kirigami principles exhibit complex motions programmable through
various energy sources, while kirigami sensors bridge the gap between
electrical conductivity and compliance. Kirigami-integrated batteries enable
energy storage directly within robot structures, enhancing flexibility and
compactness. Kirigami-controlled mechanisms mimic mechanical computations,
enabling advanced functionalities such as shape morphing and memory functions.
Applications of kirigami-enabled robots include grasping, locomotion, and
wearables, showcasing their adaptability to diverse environments and tasks.
Despite promising opportunities, challenges remain in the design of cut
patterns for a given function and streamlining fabrication techniques.

Motivation: 周期性3D重建对作物监测至关重要，但每次从头开始重建成本高昂，浪费资源且忽略了先前捕获的信息。

Method: 将先前重建模型非刚性对齐到新的部分观测，形成当前几何近似；为适应植物生长而膨胀该近似；通过集合覆盖优化问题计算最小视图集；集成完整流程包括获取额外最佳视图、规划全局最短路径。

Result: 在玉米和番茄上的半球和球体视图空间实验中，系统在保持或改善表面覆盖的同时，需要更少的视图和可比较的运动成本。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效减少周期性植物重建所需的视图数量，同时保持重建质量，优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: Periodic 3D reconstruction is essential for crop monitoring, but costly when
each cycle restarts from scratch, wasting resources and ignoring information
from previous captures. We propose temporal-prior-guided view planning for
periodic plant reconstruction, in which a previously reconstructed model of the
same plant is non-rigidly aligned to a new partial observation to form an
approximation of the current geometry. To accommodate plant growth, we inflate
this approximation and solve a set covering optimization problem to compute a
minimal set of views. We integrated this method into a complete pipeline that
acquires one additional next-best view before registration for robustness and
then plans a globally shortest path to connect the planned set of views and
outputs the best view sequence. Experiments on maize and tomato under
hemisphere and sphere view spaces show that our system maintains or improves
surface coverage while requiring fewer views and comparable movement cost
compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Multi-fingered hands are emerging as powerful platforms for performing fine
manipulation tasks, including tool use. However, environmental perturbations or
execution errors can impede task performance, motivating the use of recovery
behaviors that enable normal task execution to resume. In this work, we take
advantage of recent advances in diffusion models to construct a framework that
autonomously identifies when recovery is necessary and optimizes contact-rich
trajectories to recover. We use a diffusion model trained on the task to
estimate when states are not conducive to task execution, framed as an
out-of-distribution detection problem. We then use diffusion sampling to
project these states in-distribution and use trajectory optimization to plan
contact-rich recovery trajectories. We also propose a novel diffusion-based
approach that distills this process to efficiently diffuse the full
parameterization, including constraints, goal state, and initialization, of the
recovery trajectory optimization problem, saving time during online execution.
We compare our method to a reinforcement learning baseline and other methods
that do not explicitly plan contact interactions, including on a hardware
screwdriver-turning task where we show that recovering using our method
improves task performance by 96% and that ours is the only method evaluated
that can attempt recovery without causing catastrophic task failure. Videos can

Motivation: 研究VLA模型在真实世界场景中对自然语言变化的鲁棒性，因为现有研究尚未深入探讨其在语言扰动下的表现。

Method: 评估VLA模型在两种指令噪声下的性能：人类生成的释义和添加无关上下文，并基于长度及语义/词汇相似度对无关上下文进行分类。提出基于LLM的过滤框架从噪声输入中提取核心指令。

Result: 随着上下文扩展，模型性能持续下降；对随机上下文相对鲁棒（性能下降<10%），但对语义/词汇相似上下文性能下降约50%；人类释义导致性能下降近20%。过滤框架可在噪声条件下恢复高达98.5%的原始性能。

Conclusion: VLA模型对语言扰动敏感，特别是语义相似的无关上下文，但提出的LLM过滤框架能有效缓解这一问题，显著提升模型在噪声环境下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision Language Action (VLA) models are widely used in Embodied AI, enabling
robots to interpret and execute language instructions. However, their
robustness to natural language variability in real-world scenarios has not been
thoroughly investigated. In this work, we present a novel systematic study of
the robustness of state-of-the-art VLA models under linguistic perturbations.
Specifically, we evaluate model performance under two types of instruction
noise: (1) human-generated paraphrasing and (2) the addition of irrelevant
context. We further categorize irrelevant contexts into two groups according to
their length and their semantic and lexical proximity to robot commands. In
this study, we observe consistent performance degradation as context size
expands. We also demonstrate that the model can exhibit relative robustness to
random context, with a performance drop within 10%, while semantically and
lexically similar context of the same length can trigger a quality decline of
around 50%. Human paraphrases of instructions lead to a drop of nearly 20%. To
mitigate this, we propose an LLM-based filtering framework that extracts core
commands from noisy inputs. Incorporating our filtering step allows models to
recover up to 98.5% of their original performance under noisy conditions.

Abstract: Amid growing efforts to leverage advances in large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs) for robotics, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models
have recently gained significant attention. By unifying vision, language, and
action data at scale, which have traditionally been studied separately, VLA
models aim to learn policies that generalise across diverse tasks, objects,
embodiments, and environments. This generalisation capability is expected to
enable robots to solve novel downstream tasks with minimal or no additional
task-specific data, facilitating more flexible and scalable real-world
deployment. Unlike previous surveys that focus narrowly on action
representations or high-level model architectures, this work offers a
comprehensive, full-stack review, integrating both software and hardware
components of VLA systems. In particular, this paper provides a systematic
review of VLAs, covering their strategy and architectural transition,
architectures and building blocks, modality-specific processing techniques, and
learning paradigms. In addition, to support the deployment of VLAs in
real-world robotic applications, we also review commonly used robot platforms,
data collection strategies, publicly available datasets, data augmentation
methods, and evaluation benchmarks. Throughout this comprehensive survey, this
paper aims to offer practical guidance for the robotics community in applying
VLAs to real-world robotic systems. All references categorized by training

Abstract: This work focuses on sampling strategies of configuration variations for
generating robust universal locomotion policies for quadrupedal robots. We
investigate the effects of sampling physical robot parameters and joint
proportional-derivative gains to enable training a single reinforcement
learning policy that generalizes to multiple parameter configurations. Three
fundamental joint gain sampling strategies are compared: parameter sampling
with (1) linear and polynomial function mappings of mass-to-gains, (2)
performance-based adaptive filtering, and (3) uniform random sampling. We
improve the robustness of the policy by biasing the configurations using
nominal priors and reference models. All training was conducted on RaiSim,
tested in simulation on a range of diverse quadrupeds, and zero-shot deployed
onto hardware using the ANYmal quadruped robot. Compared to multiple baseline
implementations, our results demonstrate the need for significant joint

TL;DR: 提出基于数字孪生的蜕变测试框架，结合AI图像生成技术，为自动驾驶系统创建虚拟测试环境，提高测试覆盖率和有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动驾驶系统测试中的oracle问题和场景覆盖不足的挑战，传统测试方法难以应对复杂多变的真实驾驶环境。

Method: 使用数字孪生技术创建自动驾驶系统虚拟副本，结合Stable Diffusion等AI图像生成模型，系统性地生成多样化驾驶场景，定义基于交通规则的三种蜕变关系。

Result: 在Udacity自动驾驶模拟器中验证，获得最高真阳性率(0.719)、F1分数(0.689)和精确率(0.662)，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 数字孪生与AI场景生成的结合为自动驾驶安全测试提供了可扩展、自动化、高保真的解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of self-driving cars remains a major challenge due to the
complexity and unpredictability of real-world driving environments. Traditional
testing methods face significant limitations, such as the oracle problem, which
makes it difficult to determine whether a system's behavior is correct, and the
inability to cover the full range of scenarios an autonomous vehicle may
encounter. In this paper, we introduce a digital twin-driven metamorphic
testing framework that addresses these challenges by creating a virtual replica
of the self-driving system and its operating environment. By combining digital
twin technology with AI-based image generative models such as Stable Diffusion,
our approach enables the systematic generation of realistic and diverse driving
scenes. This includes variations in weather, road topology, and environmental
features, all while maintaining the core semantics of the original scenario.
The digital twin provides a synchronized simulation environment where changes
can be tested in a controlled and repeatable manner. Within this environment,
we define three metamorphic relations inspired by real-world traffic rules and
vehicle behavior. We validate our framework in the Udacity self-driving
simulator and demonstrate that it significantly enhances test coverage and
effectiveness. Our method achieves the highest true positive rate (0.719), F1
score (0.689), and precision (0.662) compared to baseline approaches. This
paper highlights the value of integrating digital twins with AI-powered
scenario generation to create a scalable, automated, and high-fidelity testing
solution for autonomous vehicle safety.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: TrackVLA++是一个增强型视觉-语言-动作模型，通过空间推理机制和目标识别记忆模块，在复杂遮挡和相似干扰物场景下实现更鲁棒的实体视觉跟踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言引导的跟踪方法缺乏明确的空间推理和有效的时序记忆，在严重遮挡或存在相似干扰物时容易失败。

Method: 提出两个关键模块：1) 空间推理机制Polar-CoT，通过思维链推断目标相对位置并编码为极坐标token；2) 目标识别记忆(TIM)，采用门控更新策略保持长期目标记忆。

Result: 在公开基准测试中达到最先进性能，在EVT-Bench DT分割上分别超越先前领先方法5.1和12个百分点，并表现出强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: TrackVLA++通过结合空间推理和时序记忆，显著提升了实体视觉跟踪在动态和遮挡场景下的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Embodied Visual Tracking (EVT) is a fundamental ability that underpins
practical applications, such as companion robots, guidance robots and service
assistants, where continuously following moving targets is essential. Recent
advances have enabled language-guided tracking in complex and unstructured
scenes. However, existing approaches lack explicit spatial reasoning and
effective temporal memory, causing failures under severe occlusions or in the
presence of similar-looking distractors. To address these challenges, we
present TrackVLA++, a novel Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that enhances
embodied visual tracking with two key modules, a spatial reasoning mechanism
and a Target Identification Memory (TIM). The reasoning module introduces a
Chain-of-Thought paradigm, termed Polar-CoT, which infers the target's relative
position and encodes it as a compact polar-coordinate token for action
prediction. Guided by these spatial priors, the TIM employs a gated update
strategy to preserve long-horizon target memory, ensuring spatiotemporal
consistency and mitigating target loss during extended occlusions. Extensive
experiments show that TrackVLA++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on
public benchmarks across both egocentric and multi-camera settings. On the
challenging EVT-Bench DT split, TrackVLA++ surpasses the previous leading
approach by 5.1 and 12, respectively. Furthermore, TrackVLA++ exhibits strong
zero-shot generalization, enabling robust real-world tracking in dynamic and
occluded scenarios.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出一个结合地形感知运动策略、多模态交叉注意力变换器和真实深度图像合成方法的新框架，解决人形机器人地形感知运动的训练效率和鲁棒性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前地形感知人形机器人运动主要依赖深度图像端到端学习或高程地图方法，前者存在训练效率低和仿真到真实差距问题，后者依赖多传感器导致延迟和鲁棒性降低。

Method: 1) 地形感知运动策略使用盲主干网络，利用预训练高程地图感知指导强化学习；2) 多模态交叉注意力变换器从噪声深度图像重建结构化地形表示；3) 真实深度图像合成方法使用自遮挡感知光线投射和噪声感知建模。

Result: 地形重建误差降低超过30%，在完整尺寸人形机器人上验证了跨多样挑战性地形的敏捷自适应运动能力。

Conclusion: 该框架能够在有限数据和硬件资源下实现高效策略训练，同时保留对泛化至关重要的关键地形特征。

Abstract: Recent advancements in legged robot perceptive locomotion have shown
promising progress. However, terrain-aware humanoid locomotion remains largely
constrained to two paradigms: depth image-based end-to-end learning and
elevation map-based methods. The former suffers from limited training
efficiency and a significant sim-to-real gap in depth perception, while the
latter depends heavily on multiple vision sensors and localization systems,
resulting in latency and reduced robustness. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a novel framework that tightly integrates three key components: (1)
Terrain-Aware Locomotion Policy with a Blind Backbone, which leverages
pre-trained elevation map-based perception to guide reinforcement learning with
minimal visual input; (2) Multi-Modality Cross-Attention Transformer, which
reconstructs structured terrain representations from noisy depth images; (3)
Realistic Depth Images Synthetic Method, which employs self-occlusion-aware ray
casting and noise-aware modeling to synthesize realistic depth observations,
achieving over 30\% reduction in terrain reconstruction error. This combination
enables efficient policy training with limited data and hardware resources,
while preserving critical terrain features essential for generalization. We
validate our framework on a full-sized humanoid robot, demonstrating agile and
adaptive locomotion across diverse and challenging terrains.

*Fengze Xie,Xiaozhou Fan,Jacob Schuster,Yisong Yue,Morteza Gharib*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合仿生硬件、物理信息动力学学习和凸控制分配的端到端感知控制管道，用于提高固定翼无人机的低速敏捷性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定翼无人机具有续航和效率优势，但由于高度耦合的动力学特性，缺乏低速敏捷性。测量小型机架上的气流很困难，因为近体空气动力学、螺旋桨滑流、控制面作动和环境阵风会扭曲压力信号。

Method: 受独角鲸突出的长牙启发，在机身前部安装自制多孔探头，并辅以稀疏、精心布置的机翼压力传感器进行局部流量测量。使用数据驱动校准将探头压力映射到空速和流动角度，然后学习控制仿射动力学模型。采用软左右对称正则化器提高可识别性，并使用正则化最小二乘分配器实现平滑的配平作动。

Result: 风洞研究表明，添加机翼压力可将力估计误差降低25-30%，所提出的模型在分布偏移下性能下降较少（约12%对比非结构化基线的44%），力跟踪性能随更平滑的输入而改善，包括与普通仿射模型相比法向力RMSE降低27%，与非结构化基线相比降低34%。

Conclusion: 该端到端方法通过结合仿生传感、物理信息建模和凸优化控制，显著提高了固定翼无人机在低速条件下的控制性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer endurance and efficiency but
lack low-speed agility due to highly coupled dynamics. We present an end-to-end
sensing-to-control pipeline that combines bio-inspired hardware,
physics-informed dynamics learning, and convex control allocation. Measuring
airflow on a small airframe is difficult because near-body aerodynamics,
propeller slipstream, control-surface actuation, and ambient gusts distort
pressure signals. Inspired by the narwhal's protruding tusk, we mount in-house
multi-hole probes far upstream and complement them with sparse, carefully
placed wing pressure sensors for local flow measurement. A data-driven
calibration maps probe pressures to airspeed and flow angles. We then learn a
control-affine dynamics model using the estimated airspeed/angles and sparse
sensors. A soft left/right symmetry regularizer improves identifiability under
partial observability and limits confounding between wing pressures and
flaperon inputs. Desired wrenches (forces and moments) are realized by a
regularized least-squares allocator that yields smooth, trimmed actuation.
Wind-tunnel studies across a wide operating range show that adding wing
pressures reduces force-estimation error by 25-30%, the proposed model degrades
less under distribution shift (about 12% versus 44% for an unstructured
baseline), and force tracking improves with smoother inputs, including a 27%
reduction in normal-force RMSE versus a plain affine model and 34% versus an
unstructured baseline.

TL;DR: TIGeR是一个将视觉语言模型从感知估计器转变为几何计算器的框架，通过外部工具实现精确几何计算，在机器人操作任务中达到厘米级精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在空间推理方面仅限于定性精度，缺乏机器人应用所需的计算精度，无法利用深度传感器和相机标定的度量信息。

Method: 提出TIGeR框架，让模型识别几何推理需求、生成计算代码并调用专用库进行精确计算，采用两阶段训练（监督微调+强化微调）和分层奖励设计。

Result: 在几何推理基准测试中达到SOTA性能，在真实世界机器人操作任务中展示厘米级精度。

Conclusion: 通过工具集成几何推理，TIGeR成功将VLMs从感知估计器转变为几何计算器，实现了机器人应用所需的精确几何推理能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in spatial
reasoning, yet they remain fundamentally limited to qualitative precision and
lack the computational precision required for real-world robotics. Current
approaches fail to leverage metric cues from depth sensors and camera
calibration, instead reducing geometric problems to pattern recognition tasks
that cannot deliver the centimeter-level accuracy essential for robotic
manipulation. We present TIGeR (Tool-Integrated Geometric Reasoning), a novel
framework that transforms VLMs from perceptual estimators to geometric
computers by enabling them to generate and execute precise geometric
computations through external tools. Rather than attempting to internalize
complex geometric operations within neural networks, TIGeR empowers models to
recognize geometric reasoning requirements, synthesize appropriate
computational code, and invoke specialized libraries for exact calculations. To
support this paradigm, we introduce TIGeR-300K, a comprehensive
tool-invocation-oriented dataset covering point transformations, pose
estimation, trajectory generation, and spatial compatibility verification,
complete with tool invocation sequences and intermediate computations. Through
a two-stage training pipeline combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) with our proposed hierarchical reward design,
TIGeR achieves SOTA performance on geometric reasoning benchmarks while
demonstrating centimeter-level precision in real-world robotic manipulation
tasks.

Abstract: The optimal design of robotic actuators is a critical area of research, yet
limited attention has been given to optimizing gearbox parameters and
automating actuator CAD. This paper introduces COMPAct: Computational
Optimization and Automated Modular Design of Planetary Actuators, a framework
that systematically identifies optimal gearbox parameters for a given motor
across four gearbox types, single-stage planetary gearbox (SSPG), compound
planetary gearbox (CPG), Wolfrom planetary gearbox (WPG), and double-stage
planetary gearbox (DSPG). The framework minimizes mass and actuator width while
maximizing efficiency, and further automates actuator CAD generation to enable
direct 3D printing without manual redesign. Using this framework, optimal
gearbox designs are explored over a wide range of gear ratios, providing
insights into the suitability of different gearbox types across various gear
ratio ranges. In addition, the framework is used to generate CAD models of all
four gearbox types with varying gear ratios and motors. Two actuator types are
fabricated and experimentally evaluated through power efficiency, no-load
backlash, and transmission stiffness tests. Experimental results indicate that
the SSPG actuator achieves a mechanical efficiency of 60-80 %, a no-load
backlash of 0.59 deg, and a transmission stiffness of 242.7 Nm/rad, while the
CPG actuator demonstrates 60 % efficiency, 2.6 deg backlash, and a stiffness of
201.6 Nm/rad. Code available at:

Abstract: We present a novel hybrid learning-assisted planning method, named HyPlan,
for solving the collision-free navigation problem for self-driving cars in
partially observable traffic environments. HyPlan combines methods for
multi-agent behavior prediction, deep reinforcement learning with proximal
policy optimization and approximated online POMDP planning with heuristic
confidence-based vertical pruning to reduce its execution time without
compromising safety of driving. Our experimental performance analysis on the

that HyPlan may navigate safer than selected relevant baselines and perform
significantly faster than considered alternative online POMDP planners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 操作可变形物体需要高精度和灵巧性，但物体形状的动态变化会导致对其对齐状态的感知模糊，从而产生机器人定位错误。需要解决倾斜角度和位置分类问题，向用户呈现清晰的触觉模式。

Method: 开发了一个由LinkGlide多触点触觉设备和嵌入Robotiq二指夹具的两个触觉传感器阵列组成的远程操作系统。提出基于卷积神经网络的方法来检测抓取可变形物体时的倾斜和位置，CNN生成基于识别数据的掩码来渲染多触点触觉刺激。

Conclusion: 基于CNN的方法结合多触点触觉反馈系统能够显著提高用户在远程操作可变形物体时对倾斜角度和位置的感知能力。

Abstract: Telemanipulation of deformable objects requires high precision and dexterity
from the users, which can be increased by kinesthetic and tactile feedback.
However, the object shape can change dynamically, causing ambiguous perception
of its alignment and hence errors in the robot positioning. Therefore, the tilt
angle and position classification problem has to be solved to present a clear
tactile pattern to the user. This work presents a telemanipulation system for
plastic pipettes consisting of a multi-contact haptic device LinkGlide to
deliver haptic feedback at the users' palm and two tactile sensors array
embedded in the 2-finger Robotiq gripper. We propose a novel approach based on
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect the tilt and position while
grasping deformable objects. The CNN generates a mask based on recognized tilt
and position data to render further multi-contact tactile stimuli provided to
the user during the telemanipulation. The study has shown that using the CNN
algorithm and the preset mask, tilt, and position recognition by users is
increased from 9.67% using the direct data to 82.5%.

Motivation: 在带权代理人的不可分割杂务分配中，加权最大最小份额(WMMS)是一个重要的公平性概念，但此前是否存在常数因子近似算法一直未知，这是加权公平分配领域的重要开放问题。

Method: 引入了规范实例约简和代理人估值的不同界限，设计了新的算法框架。

Result: 提出了第一个常数因子近似WMMS算法，同时证明了优于2-近似是不可能的，改进了已知的1.366下界。

Conclusion: 成功解决了加权公平分配中的关键开放问题，建立了WMMS的常数因子近似可行性，并为近似比提供了紧界。

Abstract: We study the fair allocation of indivisible chores among agents with
asymmetric weights. Among the various fairness notions, weighted maximin share
(WMMS) stands out as particularly compelling. However, whether WMMS admits a
constant-factor approximation has remained unknown and is one of the important
open problems in weighted fair division [ALMW22, Suk25]. So far, the best known
approximation ratio is O(log n), where n is the number of agents. In this
paper, we advance the state of the art and present the first constant-factor
approximate WMMS algorithm. To this end, we introduce canonical instance
reductions and different bounds of agents' valuations. We also prove that
guaranteeing better than 2-approximation is not possible, which improves the
best-known lower bound of 1.366.

Motivation: 解决在线全预测问题中，学习者需要生成预测序列供下游决策者使用，这些决策者各有不同的效用函数和约束函数，目标是让所有决策者都能获得最坏情况下的效用保证并最小化约束违规。

Method: 设计了一种算法，该算法不需要代理维护任何状态，只需解决由每轮预测定义的单轮约束优化问题，同时为所有代理获得动态遗憾保证。

Result: 算法能够同时为所有代理获得动态遗憾保证，其中每个代理的遗憾是针对交互轮次中可能变化的动作序列进行衡量，同时确保每个代理的约束违规趋近于零。

Conclusion: 这是首个在在线全预测框架中实现所有代理同时获得动态遗憾保证且约束违规趋近于零的算法，为下游决策者提供了强大的性能保证。

Abstract: We present an algorithm guaranteeing dynamic regret bounds for online
omniprediction with long term constraints. The goal in this recently introduced
problem is for a learner to generate a sequence of predictions which are
broadcast to a collection of downstream decision makers. Each decision maker
has their own utility function, as well as a vector of constraint functions,
each mapping their actions and an adversarially selected state to reward or
constraint violation terms. The downstream decision makers select actions "as
if" the state predictions are correct, and the goal of the learner is to
produce predictions such that all downstream decision makers choose actions
that give them worst-case utility guarantees while minimizing worst-case
constraint violation. Within this framework, we give the first algorithm that
obtains simultaneous \emph{dynamic regret} guarantees for all of the agents --
where regret for each agent is measured against a potentially changing sequence
of actions across rounds of interaction, while also ensuring vanishing
constraint violation for each agent. Our results do not require the agents
themselves to maintain any state -- they only solve one-round constrained
optimization problems defined by the prediction made at that round.

plausible lab-medication-adverse-event co-occurrences while retaining
score-based diffusion model stability. The reverse denoiser then produces
timestamped sequences of lab-code, medication-code, and adverse-event-flag
triples that contain no protected health information. On simulated
ultra-rare-disease cohorts, RareGraph-Synth lowers categorical Maximum Mean
Discrepancy by 40 percent relative to an unguided diffusion baseline and by
greater than 60 percent versus GAN counterparts, without sacrificing downstream
predictive utility. A black-box membership-inference evaluation using the
DOMIAS attacker yields AUROC approximately 0.53, well below the 0.55
safe-release threshold and substantially better than the approximately 0.61
plus or minus 0.03 observed for non-KG baselines, demonstrating strong
resistance to re-identification. These results suggest that integrating
biomedical knowledge graphs directly into diffusion noise schedules can
simultaneously enhance fidelity and privacy, enabling safer data sharing for
rare-disease research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型发展迅速，但在重症监护等动态复杂系统中表现有限，需要开发能够自我适应且数据需求少的AI模型。

Method: 提出分散式小代理网络架构，每个代理仅覆盖系统部分功能，通过群体学习实现自我适应。

Result: 分析表明分散式代理网络在动态环境中能够提供优于单一基础模型的决策能力，但代价是细节可复现性降低。

Conclusion: 在基础模型承担更广泛决策角色之前，需要在动态复杂系统中证明其明显优势，分散式代理网络是更有前景的替代方案。

Abstract: Foundation models have rapidly advanced AI, raising the question of whether
their decisions will ultimately surpass human strategies in real-world domains.
The exponential, and possibly super-exponential, pace of AI development makes
such analysis elusive. Nevertheless, many application areas that matter for
daily life and society show only modest gains so far; a prominent case is
diagnosing and treating dynamically evolving disease in intensive care.
  The common challenge is adapting complex systems to dynamic environments.
Effective strategies must optimize outcomes in systems composed of strongly
interacting functions while avoiding shared side effects; this requires
reliable, self-adaptive modeling. These tasks align with building digital twins
of highly complex systems whose mechanisms are not fully or quantitatively
understood. It is therefore essential to develop methods for self-adapting AI
models with minimal data and limited mechanistic knowledge. As this challenge
extends beyond medicine, AI should demonstrate clear superiority in these
settings before assuming broader decision-making roles.
  We identify the curse of dimensionality as a fundamental barrier to efficient
self-adaptation and argue that monolithic foundation models face conceptual
limits in overcoming it. As an alternative, we propose a decentralized
architecture of interacting small agent networks (SANs). We focus on agents
representing the specialized substructure of the system, where each agent
covers only a subset of the full system functions. Drawing on mathematical
results on the learning behavior of SANs and evidence from existing
applications, we argue that swarm-learning in diverse swarms can enable
self-adaptive SANs to deliver superior decision-making in dynamic environments
compared with monolithic foundation models, though at the cost of reduced
reproducibility in detail.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出MCCE框架，结合冻结的闭源大语言模型和轻量级可训练模型，通过协同进化解决多目标离散优化问题，在药物设计基准测试中取得最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统进化算法容易陷入局部最优，而专家知识对加速收敛至关重要。闭源LLM虽探索能力强但无法更新参数，开源小模型可微调但缺乏广博知识和推理能力，需要结合两者优势。

Method: MCCE框架将冻结闭源LLM与轻量可训练模型结合，维护搜索过程轨迹记忆，通过强化学习逐步精炼小模型，两模型在全局探索中相互支持和补充。

Result: 在多目标药物设计基准测试中，MCCE实现了最先进的帕累托前沿质量，并持续优于基线方法。

Conclusion: MCCE展示了混合LLM系统中实现持续进化的新范式，将知识驱动探索与经验驱动学习相结合。

Abstract: Multi-objective discrete optimization problems, such as molecular design,
pose significant challenges due to their vast and unstructured combinatorial
spaces. Traditional evolutionary algorithms often get trapped in local optima,
while expert knowledge can provide crucial guidance for accelerating
convergence. Large language models (LLMs) offer powerful priors and reasoning
ability, making them natural optimizers when expert knowledge matters. However,
closed-source LLMs, though strong in exploration, cannot update their
parameters and thus cannot internalize experience. Conversely, smaller open
models can be continually fine-tuned but lack broad knowledge and reasoning
strength. We introduce Multi-LLM Collaborative Co-evolution (MCCE), a hybrid
framework that unites a frozen closed-source LLM with a lightweight trainable
model. The system maintains a trajectory memory of past search processes; the
small model is progressively refined via reinforcement learning, with the two
models jointly supporting and complementing each other in global exploration.
Unlike model distillation, this process enhances the capabilities of both
models through mutual inspiration. Experiments on multi-objective drug design
benchmarks show that MCCE achieves state-of-the-art Pareto front quality and
consistently outperforms baselines. These results highlight a new paradigm for
enabling continual evolution in hybrid LLM systems, combining knowledge-driven
exploration with experience-driven learning.

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了标签噪声对深度神经网络隐藏表示的影响，发现隐藏表示的信息内容随网络参数数量呈现双下降现象，与测试误差行为类似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在真实世界数据集中，标签常因标注错误而存在噪声。虽然标签噪声对深度学习模型性能的影响已被广泛研究，但其对网络隐藏表示的影响仍不清楚。

Method: 使用信息不平衡（Information Imbalance）作为条件互信息的计算高效代理，系统比较隐藏表示。分析不同参数化程度下网络在干净标签和噪声标签下的表示学习。

Result: 在欠参数化状态下，噪声标签学到的表示比干净标签更信息丰富；在过参数化状态下，两者同样信息丰富。过参数化网络的表示对标签噪声具有鲁棒性。随机标签训练得到的表示性能比随机特征更差。

Conclusion: 过参数化网络的隐藏表示对标签噪声具有鲁棒性，这为理解分类任务中的泛化提供了新视角。训练于随机标签的网络超越了惰性学习，权重适应编码标签信息。

Abstract: In supervised classification tasks, models are trained to predict a label for
each data point. In real-world datasets, these labels are often noisy due to
annotation errors. While the impact of label noise on the performance of deep
learning models has been widely studied, its effects on the networks' hidden
representations remain poorly understood. We address this gap by systematically
comparing hidden representations using the Information Imbalance, a
computationally efficient proxy of conditional mutual information. Through this
analysis, we observe that the information content of the hidden representations
follows a double descent as a function of the number of network parameters,
akin to the behavior of the test error. We further demonstrate that in the
underparameterized regime, representations learned with noisy labels are more
informative than those learned with clean labels, while in the
overparameterized regime, these representations are equally informative. Our
results indicate that the representations of overparameterized networks are
robust to label noise. We also found that the information imbalance between the
penultimate and pre-softmax layers decreases with cross-entropy loss in the
overparameterized regime. This offers a new perspective on understanding
generalization in classification tasks. Extending our analysis to
representations learned from random labels, we show that these perform worse
than random features. This indicates that training on random labels drives
networks much beyond lazy learning, as weights adapt to encode labels
information.

Motivation: 复值神经网络具有更强的表示能力，但在随机神经网络中的应用受限，因为缺乏将实值表格数据集转换为复值表示的有效方法。

Method: 提出了两种将实值数据集转换为复值表示的方法：自然变换和自编码器驱动方法，并在此基础上开发了RVFL-X，这是一个复值扩展的随机向量函数链接网络。

Result: 在80个实值UCI数据集上的综合评估表明，RVFL-X始终优于原始RVFL和最先进的RNN变体，展示了其在多样化应用领域的鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: RVFL-X通过集成复值变换到实值数据集，同时保持原始RVFL架构的简单性和效率，为复值随机神经网络提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in neural networks, supported by foundational theoretical
insights, emphasize the superior representational power of complex numbers.
However, their adoption in randomized neural networks (RNNs) has been limited
due to the lack of effective methods for transforming real-valued tabular
datasets into complex-valued representations. To address this limitation, we
propose two methods for generating complex-valued representations from
real-valued datasets: a natural transformation and an autoencoder-driven
method. Building on these mechanisms, we propose RVFL-X, a complex-valued
extension of the random vector functional link (RVFL) network. RVFL-X
integrates complex transformations into real-valued datasets while maintaining
the simplicity and efficiency of the original RVFL architecture. By leveraging
complex components such as input, weights, and activation functions, RVFL-X
processes complex representations and produces real-valued outputs.
Comprehensive evaluations on 80 real-valued UCI datasets demonstrate that
RVFL-X consistently outperforms both the original RVFL and state-of-the-art
(SOTA) RNN variants, showcasing its robustness and effectiveness across diverse
application domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无状态推理方法在多步骤任务上表现不佳，缺乏持久状态；任务特定的微调方法在需要深度推理和长期依赖的任务上表现脆弱。

Method: 结合持久推理状态、对抗性变异和进化保留的状态保持多智能体进化搜索框架，通过专门智能体顺序提出、变异和评分候选测试用例。

Result: 在HumanEval和TestGenEvalMini等基准测试上，使用Llama、Gemma和GPT三种LLM，相比无状态单步基线实现了显著的覆盖率提升。

Conclusion: 将持久推理状态与进化搜索相结合，能够显著改进单元测试生成的效果。

Abstract: Recent work explores agentic inference-time techniques to perform structured,
multi-step reasoning. However, stateless inference often struggles on
multi-step tasks due to the absence of persistent state. Moreover,
task-specific fine-tuning or instruction-tuning often achieve surface-level
code generation but remain brittle on tasks requiring deeper reasoning and
long-horizon dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose stateful
multi-agent evolutionary search, a training-free framework that departs from
prior stateless approaches by combining (i) persistent inference-time state,
(ii) adversarial mutation, and (iii) evolutionary preservation. We demonstrate
its effectiveness in automated unit test generation through the generation of
edge cases. We generate robust edge cases using an evolutionary search process,
where specialized agents sequentially propose, mutate, and score candidates. A
controller maintains persistent state across generations, while evolutionary
preservation ensures diversity and exploration across all possible cases. This
yields a generalist agent capable of discovering robust, high-coverage edge
cases across unseen codebases. Experiments show our stateful multi-agent
inference framework achieves substantial gains in coverage over stateless
single-step baselines, evaluated on prevalent unit-testing benchmarks such as
HumanEval and TestGenEvalMini and using three diverse LLM families - Llama,
Gemma, and GPT. These results indicate that combining persistent inference-time
state with evolutionary search materially improves unit-test generation.

Result: 轻量级CNN和transformer架构能够从图像中恢复有意义的结结构信息，预测交叉数

Conclusion: 机器学习处理噪声视觉数据与传统不变量确保拓扑区分具有互补性，两阶段方法为实现自动结识别提供了可行路径

Abstract: Our goal is to one day take a photo of a knot and have a phone automatically
recognize it. In this expository work, we explain a strategy to approximate
this goal, using a mixture of modern machine learning methods (in particular
convolutional neural networks and transformers for image recognition) and
traditional algorithms (to compute quantum invariants like the Jones
polynomial). We present simple baselines that predict crossing number directly
from images, showing that even lightweight CNN and transformer architectures
can recover meaningful structural information. The longer-term aim is to
combine these perception modules with symbolic reconstruction into planar
diagram (PD) codes, enabling downstream invariant computation for robust knot
classification. This two-stage approach highlights the complementarity between
machine learning, which handles noisy visual data, and invariants, which
enforce rigorous topological distinctions.

Result: 在两个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，Trajectory Transformer显著提升了生成质量，有效缓解了先前方法中观察到的偏差问题。

Conclusion: Trajectory Transformer通过transformer架构成功解决了轨迹生成中的偏差和细节丢失问题，为高质量轨迹生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The widespread use of GPS devices has driven advances in spatiotemporal data
mining, enabling machine learning models to simulate human decision making and
generate realistic trajectories, addressing both data collection costs and
privacy concerns. Recent studies have shown the promise of diffusion models for
high-quality trajectory generation. However, most existing methods rely on
convolution based architectures (e.g. UNet) to predict noise during the
diffusion process, which often results in notable deviations and the loss of
fine-grained street-level details due to limited model capacity. In this paper,
we propose Trajectory Transformer, a novel model that employs a transformer
backbone for both conditional information embedding and noise prediction. We
explore two GPS coordinate embedding strategies, location embedding and
longitude-latitude embedding, and analyze model performance at different
scales. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that Trajectory
Transformer significantly enhances generation quality and effectively
alleviates the deviation issues observed in prior approaches.

Motivation: 解决现有降水临近预报方法中存在的归纳偏差问题、推理速度慢以及扩散模型计算量大的局限性，需要既准确又高效的计算模型。

Method: 提出BlockGPT模型，采用批量标记化方法，在每个时间步预测完整的二维场，通过帧内自注意力和帧间因果注意力分解时空关系。

Result: 在KNMI和SEVIR两个降水数据集上的评估显示，BlockGPT在准确性、事件定位和推理速度方面均优于现有基准模型，推理速度最高可提升31倍。

Conclusion: BlockGPT作为一种模型无关的视频预测范式，在降水临近预报任务中表现出卓越的性能和效率，为实时天气应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Predicting precipitation maps is a highly complex spatiotemporal modeling
task, critical for mitigating the impacts of extreme weather events. Short-term
precipitation forecasting, or nowcasting, requires models that are not only
accurate but also computationally efficient for real-time applications. Current
methods, such as token-based autoregressive models, often suffer from flawed
inductive biases and slow inference, while diffusion models can be
computationally intensive. To address these limitations, we introduce BlockGPT,
a generative autoregressive transformer using batched tokenization (Block)
method that predicts full two-dimensional fields (frames) at each time step.
Conceived as a model-agnostic paradigm for video prediction, BlockGPT
factorizes space-time by using self-attention within each frame and causal
attention across frames; in this work, we instantiate it for precipitation
nowcasting. We evaluate BlockGPT on two precipitation datasets, viz. KNMI
(Netherlands) and SEVIR (U.S.), comparing it to state-of-the-art baselines
including token-based (NowcastingGPT) and diffusion-based (DiffCast+Phydnet)
models. The results show that BlockGPT achieves superior accuracy, event
localization as measured by categorical metrics, and inference speeds up to 31x
faster than comparable baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合自回归模型的训练效率和扩散模型的并行推理能力，避免昂贵的端到端扩散训练成本。

Method: 通过轻量级范式转换将训练好的自回归模型转换为块级扩散模型，在推理时跨块自回归生成以保证全局连贯性，在块内通过离散扩散过程并行解码所有token。

Result: SDAR在保持自回归模型性能的同时实现并行生成，30B MoE模型在GPQA和ChemBench等科学推理基准上超越其自回归对应模型，并通过多数投票和pass@k等测试时缩放方法获得进一步改进。

Conclusion: SDAR作为一种实用范式，结合了自回归和扩散模型的优势，实现了可扩展的高吞吐量推理。

Abstract: We propose SDAR, a Synergistic Diffusion-Autoregression paradigm that unifies
the training efficiency of autoregressive models with the parallel inference
capability of diffusion. Instead of costly end-to-end diffusion training, SDAR
performs a lightweight paradigm conversion that transforms a well-trained
autoregressive (AR) model into a blockwise diffusion model through brief,
data-efficient adaptation. During inference, SDAR generates sequences
autoregressively across blocks for global coherence while decoding all tokens
within each block in parallel via a discrete diffusion process. Extensive
experiments show that AR models remain substantially more compute-efficient
than masked diffusion models, providing a strong foundation for adaptation.
Building on this insight, SDAR achieves efficient AR-to-diffusion conversion
with minimal cost, preserving AR-level performance while enabling parallel
generation. Scaling studies across dense and Mixture-of-Experts architectures
confirm that SDAR scales without compromise: larger models exhibit stronger
robustness to block size and decoding thresholds, yielding greater speedups
without accuracy loss. Beyond efficiency, SDAR demonstrates enhanced reasoning
and domain adaptability. Our 30B MoE model surpasses its AR counterpart on
challenging scientific reasoning benchmarks such as GPQA and ChemBench, and
gains further improvements under test-time scaling methods like majority voting
and pass@k. Together, these results establish SDAR as a practical paradigm that
combines the strengths of autoregression and diffusion for scalable,
high-throughput reasoning.

Motivation: 无人机通信需要准确且可解释的空对地信道模型，但确定性模型过于刚性，深度学习模型缺乏可解释性

Method: 提出物理启发的Kolmogorov-Arnold网络(PIKAN)，将自由空间路径损耗、双射线反射等物理原理作为灵活的归纳偏置引入学习过程

Result: 在无人机A2G测量数据上，PIKAN达到与深度学习模型相当的精度，仅需232个参数，比多层感知机轻37倍，同时提供符号化可解释表达式

Conclusion: PIKAN是超越5G和6G网络中无人机信道建模的高效、可解释和可扩展解决方案

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications demand accurate yet
interpretable air-to-ground (A2G) channel models that can adapt to
nonstationary propagation environments. While deterministic models offer
interpretability and deep learning (DL) models provide accuracy, both
approaches suffer from either rigidity or a lack of explainability. To bridge
this gap, we propose the Physics-Inspired Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (PIKAN)
that embeds physical principles (e.g., free-space path loss, two-ray
reflections) into the learning process. Unlike physics-informed neural networks
(PINNs), PIKAN is more flexible for applying physical information because it
introduces them as flexible inductive biases. Thus, it enables a more flexible
training process. Experiments on UAV A2G measurement data show that PIKAN
achieves comparable accuracy to DL models while providing symbolic and
explainable expressions aligned with propagation laws. Remarkably, PIKAN
achieves this performance with only 232 parameters, making it up to 37 times
lighter than multilayer perceptron (MLP) baselines with thousands of
parameters, without sacrificing correlation with measurements and also
providing symbolic expressions. These results highlight PIKAN as an efficient,
interpretable, and scalable solution for UAV channel modelling in beyond-5G and
6G networks.

Conclusion: 拉格朗日神经ODE能够有效学习物理系统的欧拉-拉格朗日方程，提升解的物理准确性。

Abstract: Neural ODEs are a widely used, powerful machine learning technique in
particular for physics. However, not every solution is physical in that it is
an Euler-Lagrange equation. We present Helmholtz metrics to quantify this
resemblance for a given ODE and demonstrate their capabilities on several
fundamental systems with noise. We combine them with a second order neural ODE
to form a Lagrangian neural ODE, which allows to learn Euler-Lagrange equations
in a direct fashion and with zero additional inference cost. We demonstrate
that, using only positional data, they can distinguish Lagrangian and
non-Lagrangian systems and improve the neural ODE solutions.

Motivation: 解决关系型领域缺乏能够跨数据集和任务迁移的架构问题，核心挑战在于关系数据的多样性，包括异构模式、图结构和函数依赖。

Method: RT架构：(i)使用表/列元数据对单元格进行标记化，(ii)通过掩码标记预测进行预训练，(iii)采用新颖的关系注意力机制，覆盖列、行和主外键链接。

Result: 在关系基准数据集上的预训练显示，2200万参数模型在二分类任务中实现了94%的完全监督AUROC，而270亿参数LLM仅为84%。微调可获得最先进结果且样本效率高。

Conclusion: RT为零样本迁移提供了实用路径，利用了任务-表上下文、关系注意力模式和模式语义，为关系数据的基础模型开辟了道路。

Abstract: Pretrained transformers readily adapt to new sequence modeling tasks via
zero-shot prompting, but relational domains still lack architectures that
transfer across datasets and tasks. The core challenge is the diversity of
relational data, with varying heterogeneous schemas, graph structures and
functional dependencies. In this paper, we present the Relational Transformer
(RT) architecture, which can be pretrained on diverse relational databases and
directly applied to unseen datasets and tasks without task- or dataset-specific
fine-tuning, or retrieval of in-context examples. RT (i) tokenizes cells with
table/column metadata, (ii) is pretrained via masked token prediction, and
(iii) utilizes a novel \textit{Relational Attention} mechanism over columns,
rows, and primary-foreign key links. Pretrained on RelBench datasets spanning
tasks such as churn and sales forecasting, RT attains strong zero-shot
performance, averaging 94% of fully supervised AUROC on binary classification
tasks with a single forward pass of a 22M parameter model, as opposed to 84%
for a 27B LLM. Fine-tuning yields state-of-the-art results with high sample
efficiency. Our experiments show that RT's zero-shot transfer harnesses
task-table context, relational attention patterns and schema semantics.
Overall, RT provides a practical path toward foundation models for relational
data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无法使用深度强化学习或计算资源有限的情况下（如通用游戏AI），需要改进现有的MCTS算法GRAVE。

Method: 在节点的探索项中包含从根节点到该节点路径上所有移动的统计信息，使用抽象编码代替精确编码，并提供改进的统计权重计算公式。

Result: 在多种游戏中测试，MCPS在双人游戏中表现优于GRAVE，在多人游戏中表现相当，且对超参数不敏感。

Conclusion: MCPS是GRAVE的有效改进，在资源受限场景下表现优异，且通过抽象编码和新的权重公式提升了算法性能。

Abstract: We propose Monte Carlo Permutation Search (MCPS), a general-purpose Monte
Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm that improves upon the GRAVE algorithm. MCPS
is relevant when deep reinforcement learning is not an option, or when the
computing power available before play is not substantial, such as in General
Game Playing, for example. The principle of MCPS is to include in the
exploration term of a node the statistics on all the playouts that contain all
the moves on the path from the root to the node. We extensively test MCPS on a
variety of games: board games, wargame, investment game, video game and
multi-player games. MCPS has better results than GRAVE in all the two-player
games. It has equivalent results for multi-player games because these games are
inherently balanced even when players have different strengths. We also show
that using abstract codes for moves instead of exact codes can be beneficial to
both MCPS and GRAVE, as they improve the permutation statistics and the AMAF
statistics. We also provide a mathematical derivation of the formulas used for
weighting the three sources of statistics. These formulas are an improvement on
the GRAVE formula since they no longer use the bias hyperparameter of GRAVE.
Moreover, MCPS is not sensitive to the ref hyperparameter.

important step towards achieving better calibration is to design an appropriate
calibration measure to meaningfully assess the miscalibration level of a
predictor. A recent line of work initiated by Haghtalab et al. [2024] studies
the design of truthful calibration measures: a truthful measure is minimized
when a predictor outputs the true probabilities, whereas a non-truthful measure
incentivizes the predictor to lie so as to appear more calibrated. All previous
calibration measures were non-truthful until Hartline et al. [2025] introduced
the first perfectly truthful calibration measures for binary prediction tasks
in the batch setting.
  We introduce a perfectly truthful calibration measure for multi-class
prediction tasks, generalizing the work of Hartline et al. [2025] beyond binary
prediction. We study common methods of extending calibration measures from
binary to multi-class prediction and identify ones that do or do not preserve
truthfulness. In addition to truthfulness, we mathematically prove and
empirically verify that our calibration measure exhibits superior robustness:
it robustly preserves the ordering between dominant and dominated predictors,
regardless of the choice of hyperparameters (bin sizes). This result addresses
the non-robustness issue of binned ECE, which has been observed repeatedly in
prior work.

Motivation: 研究非欧几里得几何（如双曲几何）中表示的边界不对称性如何被后门攻击利用，以及现有防御方法的局限性。

Method: 通过理论分析形式化边界效应，提出几何自适应触发器，并在不同任务和架构中进行实证评估。

Result: 攻击成功率在边界附近增加，而传统检测器效果减弱，与理论趋势一致。

Conclusion: 揭示了非欧几里得模型特有的几何脆弱性，为防御设计提供了分析指导。

Abstract: Non-Euclidean foundation models increasingly place representations in curved
spaces such as hyperbolic geometry. We show that this geometry creates a
boundary-driven asymmetry that backdoor triggers can exploit. Near the
boundary, small input changes appear subtle to standard input-space detectors
but produce disproportionately large shifts in the model's representation
space. Our analysis formalizes this effect and also reveals a limitation for
defenses: methods that act by pulling points inward along the radius can
suppress such triggers, but only by sacrificing useful model sensitivity in
that same direction. Building on these insights, we propose a simple
geometry-adaptive trigger and evaluate it across tasks and architectures.
Empirically, attack success increases toward the boundary, whereas conventional
detectors weaken, mirroring the theoretical trends. Together, these results
surface a geometry-specific vulnerability in non-Euclidean models and offer
analysis-backed guidance for designing and understanding the limits of
defenses.

Abstract: Is bigger always better for time series foundation models? With the question
in mind, we explore an alternative to training a single, large monolithic
model: building a portfolio of smaller, pretrained forecasting models. By
applying ensembling or model selection over these portfolios, we achieve
competitive performance on large-scale benchmarks using much fewer parameters.
We explore strategies for designing such portfolios and find that collections
of specialist models consistently outperform portfolios of independently
trained generalists. Remarkably, we demonstrate that post-training a base model
is a compute-effective approach for creating sufficiently diverse specialists,
and provide evidences that ensembling and model selection are more
compute-efficient than test-time fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个基于Hellinger定位框架的新方法，用于多轨迹时序数据中的实例最优学习率分析，显著扩展了现有方法的适用范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代机器学习中从时序相关数据学习是一个核心问题，特别是在多轨迹设置下。现有方法要么只能应用于最小二乘回归，要么需要将数据简化为i.i.d.学习或依赖混合假设，导致样本效率低下。

Method: 采用Hellinger定位框架，首先在路径测度级别通过简化为i.i.d.学习来控制平方Hellinger距离，然后在参数空间中以轨迹Fisher信息加权的二次形式进行定位。

Result: 该方法在四个不同案例研究中都获得了接近渐近正态性的实例最优学习率，显著优于标准简化方法。

Conclusion: Hellinger定位框架为多轨迹时序学习提供了通用的实例最优保证，能够充分利用完整数据预算，适用于广泛的模型和损失函数。

Abstract: Learning from temporally-correlated data is a core facet of modern machine
learning. Yet our understanding of sequential learning remains incomplete,
particularly in the multi-trajectory setting where data consists of many
independent realizations of a time-indexed stochastic process. This important
regime both reflects modern training pipelines such as for large foundation
models, and offers the potential for learning without the typical mixing
assumptions made in the single-trajectory case. However, instance-optimal
bounds are known only for least-squares regression with dependent covariates;
for more general models or loss functions, the only broadly applicable
guarantees result from a reduction to either i.i.d. learning, with effective
sample size scaling only in the number of trajectories, or an existing
single-trajectory result when each individual trajectory mixes, with effective
sample size scaling as the full data budget deflated by the mixing-time.
  In this work, we significantly broaden the scope of instance-optimal rates in
multi-trajectory settings via the Hellinger localization framework, a general
approach for maximum likelihood estimation. Our method proceeds by first
controlling the squared Hellinger distance at the path-measure level via a
reduction to i.i.d. learning, followed by localization as a quadratic form in
parameter space weighted by the trajectory Fisher information. This yields
instance-optimal bounds that scale with the full data budget under a broad set
of conditions. We instantiate our framework across four diverse case studies: a
simple mixture of Markov chains, dependent linear regression under non-Gaussian
noise, generalized linear models with non-monotonic activations, and
linear-attention sequence models. In all cases, our bounds nearly match the
instance-optimal rates from asymptotic normality, substantially improving over
standard reductions.

Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning is a challenging problem especially when the system
itself involves uncertainty. Due to noisy function evaluations, optimization
under uncertainty can be computationally expensive. In this paper, we present a
novel Bayesian optimization framework tailored for hyperparameter tuning under
uncertainty, with a focus on optimizing a scale- or precision-type parameter in
stochastic models. The proposed method employs a statistical surrogate for the
underlying random variable, enabling analytical evaluation of the expectation
operator. Moreover, we derive a closed-form expression for the optimizer of the
random acquisition function, which significantly reduces computational cost per
iteration. Compared with a conventional one-dimensional Monte Carlo-based
optimization scheme, the proposed approach requires 40 times fewer data points,
resulting in up to a 40-fold reduction in computational cost. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed method through two numerical examples in
computational engineering.

Motivation: 现有去中心化学习网络中的动态预测组合方法依赖历史性能更新权重，具有反应式特性，调整速度慢，难以适应快速变化的环境。需要一种能够预测模型未来性能的前瞻性方法。

Method: 在去中心化学习网络中增加性能预测工作者，使用机器学习模型预测各模型在时间序列中每个epoch的性能，基于预测结果分配权重。特别关注预测后悔值或后悔z分数的模型。

Result: 预测后悔值或后悔z分数的模型比预测损失的模型表现更好，能够提高网络推理的准确性。性能预测模型的性能对特征集选择和训练epoch数敏感，需要针对具体问题进行调整。

Conclusion: 基于性能预测的预测组合方法在去中心化学习网络中有效，能够提供上下文感知能力，在需要预测性而非反应性模型加权的任何场景中都有应用价值。

Abstract: In decentralized learning networks, predictions from many participants are
combined to generate a network inference. While many studies have demonstrated
performance benefits of combining multiple model predictions, existing
strategies using linear pooling methods (ranging from simple averaging to
dynamic weight updates) face a key limitation. Dynamic prediction combinations
that rely on historical performance to update weights are necessarily reactive.
Due to the need to average over a reasonable number of epochs (with moving
averages or exponential weighting), they tend to be slow to adjust to changing
circumstances (phase or regime changes). In this work, we develop a model that
uses machine learning to forecast the performance of predictions by models at
each epoch in a time series. This enables `context-awareness' by assigning
higher weight to models that are likely to be more accurate at a given time. We
show that adding a performance forecasting worker in a decentralized learning
network, following a design similar to the Allora network, can improve the
accuracy of network inferences. Specifically, we find forecasting models that
predict regret (performance relative to the network inference) or regret
z-score (performance relative to other workers) show greater improvement than
models predicting losses, which often do not outperform the naive network
inference (historically weighted average of all inferences). Through a series
of optimization tests, we show that the performance of the forecasting model
can be sensitive to choices in the feature set and number of training epochs.
These properties may depend on the exact problem and should be tailored to each
domain. Although initially designed for a decentralized learning network, using
performance forecasting for prediction combination may be useful in any
situation where predictive rather than reactive model weighting is needed.

Abstract: Transferability estimation metrics are used to find a high-performing
pre-trained model for a given target task without fine-tuning models and
without access to the source dataset. Despite the growing interest in
developing such metrics, the benchmarks used to measure their progress have
gone largely unexamined. In this work, we empirically show the shortcomings of
widely used benchmark setups to evaluate transferability estimation metrics. We
argue that the benchmarks on which these metrics are evaluated are
fundamentally flawed. We empirically demonstrate that their unrealistic model
spaces and static performance hierarchies artificially inflate the perceived
performance of existing metrics, to the point where simple, dataset-agnostic
heuristics can outperform sophisticated methods. Our analysis reveals a
critical disconnect between current evaluation protocols and the complexities
of real-world model selection. To address this, we provide concrete
recommendations for constructing more robust and realistic benchmarks to guide
future research in a more meaningful direction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 注意力汇和压缩谷作为大语言模型中的两个谜题现象，此前一直孤立研究。本文旨在探索这两者之间的内在联系，并解释LLM如何通过控制激活来组织深度计算。

Method: 通过理论证明大规模激活必然产生表征压缩，并在多个模型（410M-120B参数）上进行实验验证。当序列开始标记在中间层发展出极端激活范数时，压缩谷和注意力汇同时出现。进行针对性消融研究验证理论预测。

Result: 实验证实了大规模激活与表征压缩之间的理论关系，建立了熵减少的界限。当BOS标记在中间层产生极端激活时，压缩谷和注意力汇现象同时出现。

Conclusion: 提出了Mix-Compress-Refine信息流理论，认为基于Transformer的LLM在三个不同阶段处理标记：早期层的广泛混合、中间层的压缩计算和后期层的选择性精炼。该框架解释了为什么嵌入任务在中间层表现最佳，而生成任务受益于全深度处理。

Abstract: Attention sinks and compression valleys have attracted significant attention
as two puzzling phenomena in large language models, but have been studied in
isolation. In this work, we present a surprising connection between attention
sinks and compression valleys, tracing both to the formation of massive
activations in the residual stream. We prove theoretically that massive
activations necessarily produce representational compression and establish
bounds on the resulting entropy reduction. Through experiments across several
models (410M-120B parameters), we confirm that when the beginning-of-sequence
token develops extreme activation norms in the middle layers, both compression
valleys and attention sinks emerge simultaneously. Targeted ablation studies
validate our theoretical predictions. This unified view motivates us to propose
the Mix-Compress-Refine theory of information flow, as an attempt to explain
how LLMs organize their computation in depth by controlling attention and
representational compression via massive activations. Specifically, we posit
that Transformer-based LLMs process tokens in three distinct phases: (1) broad
mixing in the early layers, (2) compressed computation with limited mixing in
the middle layers, and (3) selective refinement in the late layers. Our
framework helps explain why embedding tasks perform best at intermediate
layers, whereas generation tasks benefit from full-depth processing, clarifying
differences in task-dependent representations.

TL;DR: Sequential-EDFL使用经验动态形式提升方法，通过随时有效的顺序测试来控制语言模型生成停止，在保持δ级错误控制的同时显著减少生成量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决语言模型生成过程中何时停止的问题，同时提供形式化的错误控制保证，减少不必要的生成计算。

Method: 跟踪信息提升（完整模型与弱化骨架基线的对数似然比），使用自归一化经验伯努利e过程，支持在线均值估计、混合e过程和分布漂移下的自适应重置。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，相比顺序基线减少22-28%的生成量，保持δ级控制，计算开销仅12%。与轻量级正确性门控结合可提高最终任务正确性。

Conclusion: EDFL作为第一阶段过滤器可减少83%的验证负担，但不能作为安全关键领域的独立解决方案，因为10.9%的停止序列仍然不正确。

Abstract: We introduce Sequential-EDFL (Empirical Dynamic Formal Lift), applying
anytime-valid sequential testing to language model generation stopping. Our
approach tracks information lift -- the log-likelihood ratio between full
models and deliberately weakened "skeleton" baselines -- using self-normalized
empirical-Bernstein e-processes that provide formal delta-level error control
regardless of stopping time. We handle unknown centering through online mean
estimation, combine multiple parameters via mixture e-processes, and support
adaptive resets under distributional drift. On six benchmarks, Sequential-EDFL
reduces generation by 22-28% vs. sequential baselines while maintaining
delta-level control with 12% computational overhead. We introduce automated
skeletons (distilled submodels, randomized logits) and show robustness across
skeleton families. Composing EDFL with a lightweight correctness gate (sentence
boundaries + verifier) improves end-task correctness while preserving
anytime-valid guarantees by only delaying stopping. Our certificates control
information sufficiency, not factual correctness -- 10.9% of stopped sequences
remain incorrect even with the gate (13.2-22.7% without it). EDFL serves as a
first-stage filter reducing verification burden by 83%, not as a standalone
solution for safety-critical domains.

Motivation: 标准蒸馏方法仅让学生模型匹配教师模型的输出，但考虑到训练大模型的成本，应该从教师模型中提取更多有用信息。

Method: 提出GUIDE方法，在参数空间强制学生模型匹配教师模型，可以与知识蒸馏结合使用。

Result: 使用GUIDE在大规模学生模型（4亿-10亿参数）上训练约200亿token时，师生质量差距减少25-26%。单独使用GUIDE比单独使用知识蒸馏效果更好。

Conclusion: GUIDE方法在不增加训练或推理开销的情况下显著提升模型质量，这些质量提升几乎是免费的。

Abstract: Algorithmic efficiency techniques such as distillation
(\cite{hinton2015distillation}) are useful in improving model quality without
increasing serving costs, provided a larger teacher model is available for a
smaller student model to learn from during training. Standard distillation
methods are limited to only forcing the student to match the teacher's outputs.
Given the costs associated with training a large model, we believe we should be
extracting more useful information from a teacher model than by just making the
student match the teacher's outputs.
  In this paper, we introduce \guide (Guided Initialization and Distillation of
Embeddings). \guide can be considered a distillation technique that forces the
student to match the teacher in the parameter space. Using \guide we show
25-26\% reduction in the teacher-student quality gap when using large student
models (400M - 1B parameters) trained on $\approx$ 20B tokens. We also present
a thorough analysis demonstrating that \guide can be combined with knowledge
distillation with near additive improvements. Furthermore, we show that
applying \guide alone leads to substantially better model quality than applying
knowledge distillation by itself.
  Most importantly, \guide introduces no training or inference overhead and
hence any model quality gains from our method are virtually free.

Abstract: Accurate time-series predictions in machine learning are heavily influenced
by the selection of appropriate input time length and sampling rate. This paper
introduces ATLO-ML, an adaptive time-length optimization system that
automatically determines the optimal input time length and sampling rate based
on user-defined output time length. The system provides a flexible approach to
time-series data pre-processing, dynamically adjusting these parameters to
enhance predictive performance. ATLO-ML is validated using air quality
datasets, including both GAMS-dataset and proprietary data collected from a
data center, both in time series format. Results demonstrate that utilizing the
optimized time length and sampling rate significantly improves the accuracy of
machine learning models compared to fixed time lengths. ATLO-ML shows potential
for generalization across various time-sensitive applications, offering a
robust solution for optimizing temporal input parameters in machine learning
workflows.

Conclusion: Medix框架通过中值操作有效识别异常值，结合理论保证和实证优势，为OOD检测提供了一种鲁棒且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection plays a crucial role in ensuring the
robustness and reliability of machine learning systems deployed in real-world
applications. Recent approaches have explored the use of unlabeled data,
showing potential for enhancing OOD detection capabilities. However,
effectively utilizing unlabeled in-the-wild data remains challenging due to the
mixed nature of both in-distribution (InD) and OOD samples. The lack of a
distinct set of OOD samples complicates the task of training an optimal OOD
classifier. In this work, we introduce Medix, a novel framework designed to
identify potential outliers from unlabeled data using the median operation. We
use the median because it provides a stable estimate of the central tendency,
as an OOD detection mechanism, due to its robustness against noise and
outliers. Using these identified outliers, along with labeled InD data, we
train a robust OOD classifier. From a theoretical perspective, we derive error
bounds that demonstrate Medix achieves a low error rate. Empirical results
further substantiate our claims, as Medix outperforms existing methods across
the board in open-world settings, confirming the validity of our theoretical
insights.

Result: 简单分类就能高精度识别生成模型，某些提示甚至能实现近乎完美的识别。

Conclusion: 文本到图像排行榜的排名操纵风险被低估，需要更强的防御措施。

Abstract: Generative AI leaderboards are central to evaluating model capabilities, but
remain vulnerable to manipulation. Among key adversarial objectives is rank
manipulation, where an attacker must first deanonymize the models behind
displayed outputs -- a threat previously demonstrated and explored for large
language models (LLMs). We show that this problem can be even more severe for
text-to-image leaderboards, where deanonymization is markedly easier. Using
over 150,000 generated images from 280 prompts and 19 diverse models spanning
multiple organizations, architectures, and sizes, we demonstrate that simple
real-time classification in CLIP embedding space identifies the generating
model with high accuracy, even without prompt control or historical data. We
further introduce a prompt-level separability metric and identify prompts that
enable near-perfect deanonymization. Our results indicate that rank
manipulation in text-to-image leaderboards is easier than previously
recognized, underscoring the need for stronger defenses.

Abstract: We establish that randomly initialized neural networks, with large width and

when their activation function is nonlinear with zero mean under the Gaussian
measure: $\mathbb{E}_{z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)}[\sigma(z)]=0$. For example, this
includes ReLU and GeLU with an additive shift, as well as tanh, but not ReLU or
GeLU by themselves. Because of their nearly independent outputs, we propose
neural networks with zero-mean activation functions as a promising candidate
for the Alignment Research Center's computational no-coincidence conjecture --
a conjecture that aims to measure the limits of AI interpretability.

Abstract: The continuous nature of belief states in POMDPs presents significant
computational challenges in learning the optimal policy. In this paper, we
consider an approach that solves a Partially Observable Reinforcement Learning
(PORL) problem by approximating the corresponding POMDP model into a
finite-state Markov Decision Process (MDP) (called Superstate MDP). We first
derive theoretical guarantees that improve upon prior work that relate the
optimal value function of the transformed Superstate MDP to the optimal value
function of the original POMDP. Next, we propose a policy-based learning
approach with linear function approximation to learn the optimal policy for the
Superstate MDP. Consequently, our approach shows that a POMDP can be
approximately solved using TD-learning followed by Policy Optimization by
treating it as an MDP, where the MDP state corresponds to a finite history. We
show that the approximation error decreases exponentially with the length of
this history. To the best of our knowledge, our finite-time bounds are the
first to explicitly quantify the error introduced when applying standard TD
learning to a setting where the true dynamics are not Markovian.

Motivation: 研究强化学习策略中由自回归模型简单目标条件化引起的不连贯结构问题，探索通过在线RL微调离线学习策略来改善这一问题的数学理论基础。

Method: 通过重新构建控制即推断和软Q学习的标准概念，建立迭代重训练过程的三向对应关系，包括将后验折叠到奖励中，以及在确定性情况下降低温度参数的方法。

Result: 证明在线RL微调离线学习策略可以减少策略不连贯性并提高回报，建立了训练-推断权衡的计算对应关系。

Conclusion: 通过软条件生成模型讨论了不连贯性与有效视野之间的联系，为理解强化学习策略优化过程提供了新的理论框架。

Abstract: We investigate mathematically the notion of incoherence: a structural issue
with reinforcement learning policies derived by naive goal-conditioning of
autoregressive models. We focus on the process of re-training models on their
own actions, that is, fine-tuning offline-learned policies with online RL. We
prove that it decreases incoherence and leads to an improvement in return, and
we aim to characterize the resulting trajectory of policies. By re-framing
standard notions of control-as-inference and soft Q learning, we establish a
three-way correspondence with two other ways of understanding the iterative
re-training process: as folding the posterior into the reward and, in the
deterministic case, as decreasing the temperature parameter; the correspondence
has computational content via the training-inference trade-off. Through
soft-conditioning generative models, we discuss the link between incoherence
and the effective horizon.

### [151] [The Markovian Thinker](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06557)
*Milad Aghajohari,Kamran Chitsaz,Amirhossein Kazemnejad,Sarath Chandar,Alessandro Sordoni,Aaron Courville,Siva Reddy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Markovian Thinking范式，通过将推理过程分解为固定大小的块，实现线性计算复杂度和恒定内存使用，解决了传统RL推理中状态无限增长和二次计算开销的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习推理环境中，状态包含所有先前推理标记，导致状态无界且注意力机制需要二次计算开销。需要重新设计推理环境来解决长链推理的计算效率问题。

Method: 提出Delethink环境，将推理结构化为固定大小的块。在每个块内模型正常推理，在边界处重置上下文并用简短延续重新初始化提示。通过RL训练策略学习在块结束时写入足够的文本状态以实现无缝推理延续。

Result: 1.5B模型在8K标记块中推理，但能思考长达24K标记，性能匹配或超越使用24K预算训练的LongCoT-RL。在96K平均思考长度下，Delethink成本为7 H100-月，而LongCoT-RL为27 H100-月。

Conclusion: 重新设计推理环境是强大杠杆，能够实现超长推理而无需二次开销，为高效、可扩展的推理LLM开辟了道路。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become a strong recipe for training
reasoning LLMs that produce long chains of thought (LongCoT). Yet the standard
RL "thinking environment", where the state is the prompt plus all prior
reasoning tokens, makes the state unbounded and forces attention-based policies
to pay quadratic compute as thoughts lengthen. We revisit the environment
itself. We propose Markovian Thinking, a paradigm in which the policy advances
reasoning while conditioning on a constant-size state, decoupling thinking
length from context size. As an immediate consequence this yields linear
compute with constant memory. We instantiate this idea with Delethink, an RL
environment that structures reasoning into fixed-size chunks. Within each
chunk, the model thinks as usual; at the boundary, the environment resets the
context and reinitializes the prompt with a short carryover. Through RL, the
policy learns to write a textual state near the end of each chunk sufficient
for seamless continuation of reasoning after reset. Trained in this
environment, an R1-Distill 1.5B model reasons in 8K-token chunks yet thinks up
to 24K tokens, matching or surpassing LongCoT-RL trained with a 24K budget.
With test-time scaling, Delethink continues to improve where LongCoT plateaus.
The effect of linear compute is substantial: we empirically estimate at 96K
average thinking length LongCoT-RL costs 27 H100-months vs. 7 for Delethink.
Analysis at RL initialization shows off-the-shelf reasoning models (1.5B-120B)
often sample Markovian traces zero-shot across diverse benchmarks, providing
positive samples that make RL effective at scale. Our results show that
redesigning the thinking environment is a powerful lever: it enables very long
reasoning without quadratic overhead and opens a path toward efficient,
scalable reasoning LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了DecompGAIL方法，通过分解真实感为ego-map和ego-neighbor组件，过滤误导性交互，解决多智能体GAIL在交通仿真中的不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模仿学习方法难以建模真实交通行为：行为克隆存在协变量偏移问题，而GAIL在多智能体设置中极不稳定，主要原因是无关交互误导。

Method: DecompGAIL方法：1）将真实感分解为ego-map和ego-neighbor组件；2）过滤误导性的neighbor:neighbor和neighbor:map交互；3）引入社会PPO目标，用距离加权的邻域奖励增强ego奖励。

Result: 在WOMD Sim Agents 2025基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DecompGAIL通过分解真实感和过滤误导性交互，有效解决了多智能体GAIL的不稳定性问题，为自动驾驶系统和城市交通规划提供了更真实的交通仿真。

Abstract: Realistic traffic simulation is critical for the development of autonomous
driving systems and urban mobility planning, yet existing imitation learning
approaches often fail to model realistic traffic behaviors. Behavior cloning
suffers from covariate shift, while Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning
(GAIL) is notoriously unstable in multi-agent settings. We identify a key
source of this instability: irrelevant interaction misguidance, where a
discriminator penalizes an ego vehicle's realistic behavior due to unrealistic
interactions among its neighbors. To address this, we propose Decomposed
Multi-agent GAIL (DecompGAIL), which explicitly decomposes realism into ego-map
and ego-neighbor components, filtering out misleading neighbor: neighbor and
neighbor: map interactions. We further introduce a social PPO objective that
augments ego rewards with distance-weighted neighborhood rewards, encouraging
overall realism across agents. Integrated into a lightweight SMART-based
backbone, DecompGAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WOMD Sim
Agents 2025 benchmark.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 比较了两种AI框架与纯人工评估在医学影像疾病评估中的表现，发现AI作为辅助阅读者(AI-SR)是最适合临床试验的方法，即使在模型性能严重下降时仍能保持可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI在临床试验中具有巨大潜力，但缺乏保障措施会带来显著风险，特别是在评估直接影响试验结论的患者终点时。

Method: 使用两种随机对照试验，基于脊柱X射线图像终点，比较AI框架与纯人工评估，通过注入从随机猜测到简单预测的劣质模型来压力测试框架。

Result: AI作为辅助阅读者(AI-SR)方法在各种模型类型下均满足所有标准，即使使用劣质模型也能提供可靠的疾病估计，保持临床试验治疗效果估计和结论的有效性。

Conclusion: AI-SR是临床试验中最合适的方法，能够持续提供可靠结果，并在应用于不同人群时保持这些优势。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise for supporting clinical
trials, from patient recruitment and endpoint assessment to treatment response
prediction. However, deploying AI without safeguards poses significant risks,
particularly when evaluating patient endpoints that directly impact trial
conclusions. We compared two AI frameworks against human-only assessment for
medical image-based disease evaluation, measuring cost, accuracy, robustness,
and generalization ability. To stress-test these frameworks, we injected bad
models, ranging from random guesses to naive predictions, to ensure that
observed treatment effects remain valid even under severe model degradation. We
evaluated the frameworks using two randomized controlled trials with endpoints
derived from spinal X-ray images. Our findings indicate that using AI as a
supporting reader (AI-SR) is the most suitable approach for clinical trials, as
it meets all criteria across various model types, even with bad models. This
method consistently provides reliable disease estimation, preserves clinical
trial treatment effect estimates and conclusions, and retains these advantages
when applied to different populations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语义在自监督定位框架中的作用，探索模型是否能够有效过滤环境噪声并识别具有区分度的地标，从而提高定位的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Method: 训练定位网络处理原始和扰动地图，进行事后内省分析，验证多种可解释性方法，并进行语义类别消融实验。

Result: 积分梯度和注意力权重被证明是最可靠的学习行为探针，语义消融显示频繁出现的对象往往被降权处理。

Conclusion: 模型学会了噪声鲁棒、语义显著的地点定义关系，能够在具有挑战性的视觉和结构变化下实现可解释的配准。

Abstract: This work investigates how semantics influence localisation performance and
robustness in a learned self-supervised, contrastive semantic localisation
framework. After training a localisation network on both original and perturbed
maps, we conduct a thorough post-hoc introspection analysis to probe whether
the model filters environmental noise and prioritises distinctive landmarks
over routine clutter. We validate various interpretability methods and present
a comparative reliability analysis. Integrated gradients and Attention Weights
consistently emerge as the most reliable probes of learned behaviour. A
semantic class ablation further reveals an implicit weighting in which frequent
objects are often down-weighted. Overall, the results indicate that the model
learns noise-robust, semantically salient relations about place definition,
thereby enabling explainable registration under challenging visual and
structural variations.

*Canyu Lei,Benjamin Lobo,Jianxin Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出DPA-Net双路径注意力神经网络，从稀疏的SMBG数据直接估计AGP指标，解决CGM成本高、普及受限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CGM设备成本高、可及性差，尤其在低收入地区难以普及；而SMBG价格低廉但数据稀疏，难以转化为临床有意义的血糖指标。

Method: DPA-Net包含两条互补路径：空间通道注意力路径重建CGM样轨迹，多尺度ResNet路径直接预测AGP指标，并引入对齐机制减少偏差。还开发了主动点选择器识别有意义的采样点。

Result: 在大型真实数据集上的实验表明，DPA-Net实现了稳健的准确性，误差低且减少了系统偏差。

Conclusion: 这是首个从SMBG数据估计AGP指标的监督机器学习框架，为无法使用CGM的场景提供了实用的临床决策支持工具。

Abstract: Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) provides dense and dynamic glucose
profiles that enable reliable estimation of Ambulatory Glucose Profile (AGP)
metrics, such as Time in Range (TIR), Time Below Range (TBR), and Time Above
Range (TAR). However, the high cost and limited accessibility of CGM restrict
its widespread adoption, particularly in low- and middle-income regions. In
contrast, self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is inexpensive and widely
available but yields sparse and irregular data that are challenging to
translate into clinically meaningful glycemic metrics.
  In this work, we propose a Dual-Path Attention Neural Network (DPA-Net) to
estimate AGP metrics directly from SMBG data. DPA-Net integrates two
complementary paths: (1) a spatial-channel attention path that reconstructs a
CGM-like trajectory from sparse SMBG observations, and (2) a multi-scale ResNet
path that directly predicts AGP metrics. An alignment mechanism between the two
paths is introduced to reduce bias and mitigate overfitting. In addition, we
develop an active point selector to identify realistic and informative SMBG
sampling points that reflect patient behavioral patterns.
  Experimental results on a large, real-world dataset demonstrate that DPA-Net
achieves robust accuracy with low errors while reducing systematic bias. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first supervised machine learning framework
for estimating AGP metrics from SMBG data, offering a practical and clinically
relevant decision-support tool in settings where CGM is not accessible.

TL;DR: POME是一种后优化模型编辑算法，通过仅使用预训练和微调检查点来提升微调后大语言模型的性能，无需额外数据或优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决微调后模型性能提升的问题，避免需要额外数据或重新训练的开销。

Method: 对权重差异ΔW应用muon-style投影，使用截断奇异值分解(SVD)来平衡主要更新方向的影响并修剪代表噪声的小奇异值。

Result: 在GSM8K上平均性能提升+2.5%，在代码生成上提升+1.0%，适用于从7B基础模型到72B RLHF指导模型的各种规模。

Conclusion: POME是一个实用、零成本的后处理增强方法，与任何优化器或分布式框架完全兼容。

Abstract: We introduce Post-Optimization Model Edit (POME), a new algorithm that
enhances the performance of fine-tuned large language models using only their
pretrained and fine-tuned checkpoints, without requiring extra data or further
optimization. The core idea is to apply a muon-style projection to $\Delta W$,
the difference between the fine-tuned and pretrained weights. This projection
uses truncated singular value decomposition (SVD) to equalize the influence of
dominant update directions and prune small singular values, which often
represent noise. As a simple post-processing step, POME is completely decoupled
from the training pipeline. It requires zero modifications and imposes no
overhead, making it universally compatible with any optimizer or distributed
framework. POME delivers consistent gains, boosting average performance by
+2.5\% on GSM8K and +1.0\% on code generation. Its broad applicability -- from
7B foundation models to 72B RLHF-instructed models -- establishes it as a
practical, zero-cost enhancement for any fine-tuning pipeline. Code is
available at https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/POME.

future frame prediction. We condition the video generation on robot states
using AdaLN-Zero, and further post-train the model using LoRA. For the

Our models achieve 23.0 dB PSNR in the sampling task and a Top-500 CE of 6.6386
in the compression task, securing 1st place in both challenges.

Conclusion: 该方法将边缘感知消息传递与水力模拟相结合，能够从有限传感器部署实现准确的网络范围预测，可扩展到各种地下水管网络

Abstract: Underground water and wastewater pipelines are vital for city operations but
plagued by anomalies like leaks and infiltrations, causing substantial water
loss, environmental damage, and high repair costs. Conventional manual
inspections lack efficiency, while dense sensor deployments are prohibitively
expensive. In recent years, artificial intelligence has advanced rapidly and is
increasingly applied to urban infrastructure. In this research, we propose an
integrated AI and remote-sensor framework to address the challenge of leak
detection in underground water pipelines, through deploying a sparse set of
remote sensors to capture real-time flow and depth data, paired with HydroNet -
a dedicated model utilizing pipeline attributes (e.g., material, diameter,
slope) in a directed graph for higher-precision modeling. Evaluations on a
real-world campus wastewater network dataset demonstrate that our system
collects effective spatio-temporal hydraulic data, enabling HydroNet to
outperform advanced baselines. This integration of edge-aware message passing
with hydraulic simulations enables accurate network-wide predictions from
limited sensor deployments. We envision that this approach can be effectively
extended to a wide range of underground water pipeline networks.

TL;DR: ELMUR是一种具有结构化外部记忆的Transformer架构，通过双向交叉注意力和LRU记忆模块扩展有效视野，在部分可观测环境下显著提升决策性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的机器人代理需要在部分可观测和长视野环境下行动，但现有方法主要依赖瞬时信息，难以处理长期依赖关系。

Method: 提出ELMUR架构，每层维护记忆嵌入，通过双向交叉注意力与记忆交互，并使用LRU记忆模块进行更新（替换或凸混合）。

Result: 在合成T-Maze任务中达到100%成功率（走廊长达100万步），在POPGym中超过一半任务优于基线，在MIKASA-Robo稀疏奖励操作任务中性能几乎翻倍。

Conclusion: 结构化、层局部外部记忆为部分可观测环境下的决策提供了一种简单且可扩展的方法。

Abstract: Real-world robotic agents must act under partial observability and long
horizons, where key cues may appear long before they affect decision making.
However, most modern approaches rely solely on instantaneous information,
without incorporating insights from the past. Standard recurrent or transformer
models struggle with retaining and leveraging long-term dependencies: context
windows truncate history, while naive memory extensions fail under scale and
sparsity. We propose ELMUR (External Layer Memory with Update/Rewrite), a
transformer architecture with structured external memory. Each layer maintains
memory embeddings, interacts with them via bidirectional cross-attention, and
updates them through an Least Recently Used (LRU) memory module using
replacement or convex blending. ELMUR extends effective horizons up to 100,000
times beyond the attention window and achieves a 100% success rate on a
synthetic T-Maze task with corridors up to one million steps. In POPGym, it
outperforms baselines on more than half of the tasks. On MIKASA-Robo
sparse-reward manipulation tasks with visual observations, it nearly doubles
the performance of strong baselines. These results demonstrate that structured,
layer-local external memory offers a simple and scalable approach to decision
making under partial observability.

Conclusion: Chem-NMF方法通过物理化学视角成功解决了NMF收敛性问题，显著提升了聚类性能，为NMF算法提供了新的理论分析框架。

Abstract: Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is an unsupervised learning method
offering low-rank representations across various domains such as audio
processing, biomedical signal analysis, and image recognition. The
incorporation of $\alpha$-divergence in NMF formulations enhances flexibility
in optimization, yet extending these methods to multi-layer architectures
presents challenges in ensuring convergence. To address this, we introduce a
novel approach inspired by the Boltzmann probability of the energy barriers in
chemical reactions to theoretically perform convergence analysis. We introduce
a novel method, called Chem-NMF, with a bounding factor which stabilizes
convergence. To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply a physical
chemistry perspective to rigorously analyze the convergence behaviour of the
NMF algorithm. We start from mathematically proven asymptotic convergence
results and then show how they apply to real data. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm improves clustering accuracy by 5.6%
$\pm$ 2.7% on biomedical signals and 11.1% $\pm$ 7.2% on face images (mean
$\pm$ std).

Motivation: 流匹配在噪声到数据的转换中表现良好，但在分布到分布的转换场景中，由于源分布也是从有限样本中学习得到的，标准流匹配方法因稀疏监督而失败。

Conclusion: 该方法使流匹配成为模拟科学中出现的多样化分布转换的更实用工具，更好地突出了转换的真实效果。

Abstract: Modeling transformations between arbitrary data distributions is a
fundamental scientific challenge, arising in applications like drug discovery
and evolutionary simulation. While flow matching offers a natural framework for
this task, its use has thus far primarily focused on the noise-to-data setting,
while its application in the general distribution-to-distribution setting is
underexplored. We find that in the latter case, where the source is also a data
distribution to be learned from limited samples, standard flow matching fails
due to sparse supervision. To address this, we propose a simple and
computationally efficient method that injects stochasticity into the training
process by perturbing source samples and flow interpolants. On five diverse
imaging tasks spanning biology, radiology, and astronomy, our method
significantly improves generation quality, outperforming existing baselines by
an average of 9 FID points. Our approach also reduces the transport cost
between input and generated samples to better highlight the true effect of the
transformation, making flow matching a more practical tool for simulating the
diverse distribution transformations that arise in science.

Result: 在基准PDE系统上的实验表明，StruSR相比传统基线提高了收敛速度、结构保真度和表达式可解释性

Conclusion: StruSR为基于物理的符号发现提供了一个原则性范式

Abstract: Symbolic regression aims to find interpretable analytical expressions by
searching over mathematical formula spaces to capture underlying system
behavior, particularly in scientific modeling governed by physical laws.
However, traditional methods lack mechanisms for extracting structured physical
priors from time series observations, making it difficult to capture symbolic
expressions that reflect the system's global behavior. In this work, we propose
a structure-aware symbolic regression framework, called StruSR, that leverages
trained Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to extract locally structured
physical priors from time series data. By performing local Taylor expansions on
the outputs of the trained PINN, we obtain derivative-based structural
information to guide symbolic expression evolution. To assess the importance of
expression components, we introduce a masking-based attribution mechanism that
quantifies each subtree's contribution to structural alignment and physical
residual reduction. These sensitivity scores steer mutation and crossover
operations within genetic programming, preserving substructures with high
physical or structural significance while selectively modifying less
informative components. A hybrid fitness function jointly minimizes physics
residuals and Taylor coefficient mismatch, ensuring consistency with both the
governing equations and the local analytical behavior encoded by the PINN.
Experiments on benchmark PDE systems demonstrate that StruSR improves
convergence speed, structural fidelity, and expression interpretability
compared to conventional baselines, offering a principled paradigm for
physics-grounded symbolic discovery.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in test-time scaling and finetuning of diffusion
models, guidance in Auto-Regressive Diffusion Models (ARDMs) remains
underexplored. We introduce an amortized framework that augments pretrained
ARDMs with a lightweight controller network, trained offline by previewing
future ARDM rollouts and learning stepwise controls that anticipate upcoming
observations under a terminal cost objective. We evaluate this framework in the
context of data assimilation (DA) for chaotic spatiotemporal partial
differential equations (PDEs), a setting where existing methods are often
computationally prohibitive and prone to forecast drift under sparse
observations. Our approach reduces DA inference to a single forward rollout
with on-the-fly corrections, avoiding expensive adjoint computations and/or
optimizations during inference. We demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms four state-of-the-art baselines in stability, accuracy, and
physical fidelity across two canonical PDEs and six observation regimes. We
will release code and checkpoints publicly.

Method: 将多分辨率推理解耦为两个关键行为：1）对不同频率信息的推断；2）在不同分辨率间的插值。通过实证研究评估MLOs在这两个任务上的表现，并提出一种简单、计算高效且数据驱动的多分辨率训练协议来克服混叠问题。

Result: 实证研究表明，MLOs无法以零样本方式完成这两个任务。MLOs无法在与其训练分辨率不同的分辨率下进行准确推理，反而表现出脆弱性且容易受到混叠影响。

Conclusion: 提出的多分辨率训练协议能够克服混叠问题，并提供稳健的多分辨率泛化能力，解决了现有MLOs在多分辨率推理中的局限性。

Abstract: A core challenge in scientific machine learning, and scientific computing
more generally, is modeling continuous phenomena which (in practice) are
represented discretely. Machine-learned operators (MLOs) have been introduced
as a means to achieve this modeling goal, as this class of architecture can
perform inference at arbitrary resolution. In this work, we evaluate whether
this architectural innovation is sufficient to perform "zero-shot
super-resolution," namely to enable a model to serve inference on
higher-resolution data than that on which it was originally trained. We
comprehensively evaluate both zero-shot sub-resolution and super-resolution
(i.e., multi-resolution) inference in MLOs. We decouple multi-resolution
inference into two key behaviors: 1) extrapolation to varying frequency
information; and 2) interpolating across varying resolutions. We empirically
demonstrate that MLOs fail to do both of these tasks in a zero-shot manner.
Consequently, we find MLOs are not able to perform accurate inference at
resolutions different from those on which they were trained, and instead they
are brittle and susceptible to aliasing. To address these failure modes, we
propose a simple, computationally-efficient, and data-driven multi-resolution
training protocol that overcomes aliasing and that provides robust
multi-resolution generalization.

TL;DR: 提出了ARQ方法，一种基于前向-前向算法思想的价值估计方法，在强化学习中实现了无反向传播的局部学习，在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前向-前向算法主要局限于监督学习，而强化学习领域自然产生学习信号，需要将其扩展到强化学习领域。

Method: 引入动作条件均方根Q函数(ARQ)，使用层活动统计的好度函数和动作条件，通过时序差分学习实现局部强化学习。

Result: 在MinAtar和DeepMind Control Suite基准测试中，ARQ优于最先进的无反向传播局部强化学习方法，并在大多数任务中超越使用反向传播训练的算法。

Conclusion: ARQ方法简单且具有生物学基础，在强化学习中实现了有效的无反向传播学习，性能优异。

Abstract: The Forward-Forward (FF) Algorithm is a recently proposed learning procedure
for neural networks that employs two forward passes instead of the traditional
forward and backward passes used in backpropagation. However, FF remains
largely confined to supervised settings, leaving a gap at domains where
learning signals can be yielded more naturally such as RL. In this work,
inspired by FF's goodness function using layer activity statistics, we
introduce Action-conditioned Root mean squared Q-Functions (ARQ), a novel value
estimation method that applies a goodness function and action conditioning for
local RL using temporal difference learning. Despite its simplicity and
biological grounding, our approach achieves superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art local backprop-free RL methods in the MinAtar and the DeepMind
Control Suite benchmarks, while also outperforming algorithms trained with
backpropagation on most tasks. Code can be found at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于高斯混合模型的新型非线性模块GMNM，能够替代传统激活函数，提升各种神经网络架构的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络（如MLP、CNN、Transformer）通过线性组合和激活函数引入非线性，但受限于激活函数的选择，非线性表达能力有限

Method: 基于高斯混合模型的通用密度近似特性和高斯核的距离特性，放松概率约束，采用灵活的高斯投影参数化，构建可微分模块GMNM，可集成到各种神经网络架构中端到端训练

Result: 在MLP、CNN、注意力机制和LSTM等架构中加入GMNM模块，相比标准基线模型性能均有提升

Conclusion: GMNM作为一种强大灵活的非线性模块，有潜力在广泛的机器学习应用中提升效率和准确性

Abstract: Neural networks in general, from MLPs and CNNs to attention-based
Transformers, are constructed from layers of linear combinations followed by
nonlinear operations such as ReLU, Sigmoid, or Softmax. Despite their strength,
these conventional designs are often limited in introducing non-linearity by
the choice of activation functions. In this work, we introduce Gaussian
Mixture-Inspired Nonlinear Modules (GMNM), a new class of differentiable
modules that draw on the universal density approximation Gaussian mixture
models (GMMs) and distance properties (metric space) of Gaussian kernal. By
relaxing probabilistic constraints and adopting a flexible parameterization of
Gaussian projections, GMNM can be seamlessly integrated into diverse neural
architectures and trained end-to-end with gradient-based methods. Our
experiments demonstrate that incorporating GMNM into architectures such as
MLPs, CNNs, attention mechanisms, and LSTMs consistently improves performance
over standard baselines. These results highlight GMNM's potential as a powerful
and flexible module for enhancing efficiency and accuracy across a wide range
of machine learning applications.

<details>

Motivation: 尽管Transformer已成为序列建模的主流架构，但其结构参数如何影响表达能力尚缺乏深入理解，特别是注意力头数量的作用。

Method: 引入广义D-检索任务作为理论框架基础，分析Transformer在ε-逼近中的参数复杂度上下界，特别关注注意力头数量的影响。

Result: 证明多头Transformer可实现高效逼近，而头数过少时参数复杂度需按O(1/ε^{cT})增长；单头情况下需要O(T)维嵌入才能完全记忆输入。

Conclusion: 注意力头数量对Transformer的表达能力有重要影响，多头设计在非线性实际场景中具有理论优势，实验验证了理论结果的实际相关性。

Abstract: Transformer has become the dominant architecture for sequence modeling, yet a
detailed understanding of how its structural parameters influence expressive
power remains limited. In this work, we study the approximation properties of
transformers, with particular emphasis on the role of the number of attention
heads. Our analysis begins with the introduction of a generalized $D$-retrieval
task, which we prove to be dense in the space of continuous functions, thereby
providing the basis for our theoretical framework. We then establish both upper
and lower bounds on the parameter complexity required for
$\epsilon$-approximation. Specifically, we show that transformers with
sufficiently many heads admit efficient approximation, whereas with too few
heads, the number of parameters must scale at least as $O(1/\epsilon^{cT})$,
for some constant $c$ and sequence length $T$. To the best of our knowledge,
this constitutes the first rigorous lower bound of this type in a nonlinear and
practically relevant setting. We further examine the single-head case and
demonstrate that an embedding dimension of order $O(T)$ allows complete
memorization of the input, where approximation is entirely achieved by the
feed-forward block. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings with
experiments on both synthetic data and real-world tasks, illustrating the
practical relevance of our results.

TL;DR: XRPO是一个强化学习框架，通过探索-利用平衡优化语言模型推理能力，在数学和编程基准测试中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GRPO等方法存在探索不足和反馈信号利用不充分的问题，主要由于跨提示的上下文无关rollout分配和过度依赖稀疏奖励。

Method: 引入数学基础的rollout分配器自适应优先处理不确定性高的提示；使用上下文种子策略注入示例引导困难推理轨迹；开发基于序列似然的优势锐化机制放大低概率但正确的响应。

Result: 在数学和编程基准测试中，XRPO比GRPO和GSPO等方法提升4% pass@1和6% cons@32，训练收敛速度加快2.7倍。

Conclusion: XRPO通过探索-利用的统一框架有效解决了现有方法在推理任务中的局限性，显著提升了语言模型的推理性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms such as GRPO have driven recent advances in
large language model (LLM) reasoning. While scaling the number of rollouts
stabilizes training, existing approaches suffer from limited exploration on
challenging prompts and leave informative feedback signals underexploited, due
to context-independent rollout allocation across prompts (e.g., generating 16
rollouts per prompt) and relying heavily on sparse rewards. This paper presents
XRPO(eXplore - eXploit GRPO), a unified framework that recasts policy
optimization through the principled lens of rollout exploration-exploitation.
To enhance exploration, XRPO introduces a mathematically grounded rollout
allocator that adaptively prioritizes prompts with higher potential for
uncertainty reduction. It further addresses stagnation on zero-reward prompts
through an in-context seeding strategy that injects curated exemplars, steering
the model into more difficult reasoning trajectories. To strengthen
exploitation, XRPO develops a group-relative, novelty-aware advantage
sharpening mechanism that leverages sequence likelihoods to amplify
low-probability yet correct responses, thereby extending the policy's reach
beyond sparse rewards. Experiments across diverse math and coding benchmarks on
both reasoning and non-reasoning models demonstrate that XRPO outperforms
existing advances (e.g., GRPO and GSPO) up to 4% pass@1 and 6% cons@32, while
accelerating training convergence by up to 2.7X.

TL;DR: TimeFormer：一种专为时间序列设计的Transformer架构，通过改进的自注意力机制（MoSA）捕获时间序列的单向性和衰减影响特性，在多个真实数据集上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer在时间序列预测中表现不佳，因为未能充分考虑文本和时间序列模态的差异，特别是时间序列的单向影响和衰减影响特性。

Method: 提出TimeFormer架构，核心是带有两个调制项的自注意力机制（MoSA），在Hawkes过程和因果掩码约束下捕获时间先验，并引入多尺度和子序列分析框架来丰富时间依赖关系。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上的实验表明，TimeFormer显著优于最先进方法，MSE最多降低7.45%，在94.04%的评估指标上创造了新基准。

Conclusion: TimeFormer成功地将时间序列特性融入Transformer架构，MoSA机制可广泛应用于提升其他基于Transformer的模型性能。

Abstract: Although Transformers excel in natural language processing, their extension
to time series forecasting remains challenging due to insufficient
consideration of the differences between textual and temporal modalities. In
this paper, we develop a novel Transformer architecture designed for time
series data, aiming to maximize its representational capacity. We identify two
key but often overlooked characteristics of time series: (1) unidirectional
influence from the past to the future, and (2) the phenomenon of decaying
influence over time. These characteristics are introduced to enhance the
attention mechanism of Transformers. We propose TimeFormer, whose core
innovation is a self-attention mechanism with two modulation terms (MoSA),
designed to capture these temporal priors of time series under the constraints
of the Hawkes process and causal masking. Additionally, TimeFormer introduces a
framework based on multi-scale and subsequence analysis to capture semantic
dependencies at different temporal scales, enriching the temporal dependencies.
Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world datasets show that
TimeFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to
a 7.45% reduction in MSE compared to the best baseline and setting new
benchmarks on 94.04\% of evaluation metrics. Moreover, we demonstrate that the
MoSA mechanism can be broadly applied to enhance the performance of other
Transformer-based models.

Motivation: 解决分布式多玩家多臂老虎机问题中玩家间的碰撞问题，在无中心协调的情况下，仅通过自身动作和碰撞反馈来最大化累积奖励。

Method: 设计分布式算法，采用自适应高效通信协议，玩家仅观察自身动作和碰撞反馈，在异步周期设置中扩展算法。

Result: 算法实现近最优的群体和个人遗憾，通信成本仅为O(log log T)，实验显示相比现有方法显著降低个人遗憾，在异步设置中实现对数遗憾。

Conclusion: 提出的分布式算法在无中心协调的多玩家多臂老虎机问题中有效，通信效率高，性能优于现有方法，并成功扩展到异步设置。

Abstract: We study the stochastic Multiplayer Multi-Armed Bandit (MMAB) problem, where
multiple players select arms to maximize their cumulative rewards. Collisions
occur when two or more players select the same arm, resulting in no reward, and
are observed by the players involved. We consider a distributed setting without
central coordination, where each player can only observe their own actions and
collision feedback. We propose a distributed algorithm with an adaptive,
efficient communication protocol. The algorithm achieves near-optimal group and
individual regret, with a communication cost of only $\mathcal{O}(\log\log T)$.
Our experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing
baselines. Compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, our approach achieves a
notable reduction in individual regret. Finally, we extend our approach to a
periodic asynchronous setting, proving the lower bound for this problem and
presenting an algorithm that achieves logarithmic regret.

TL;DR: 提出AutoBalance训练范式，通过为每个损失分量分配独立的自适应优化器，解决PINNs中多损失项平衡困难的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PINNs训练困难，因为需要平衡具有冲突目标和不同曲率的多个损失项（如PDE残差和边界条件），现有方法在优化前操纵梯度的策略存在根本限制。

Method: AutoBalance采用"后组合"训练范式，为每个损失分量分配独立的自适应优化器，然后聚合经过预处理的更新结果。

Result: 在具有挑战性的PDE基准测试中，AutoBalance始终优于现有框架，在MSE和L∞范数下显著降低解误差。

Conclusion: AutoBalance是一种新颖有效的PINNs训练方法，与其他流行PINN方法正交且互补，能在高要求基准测试中增强其有效性。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) provide a powerful and general
framework for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) by embedding
physical laws into loss functions. However, training PINNs is notoriously
difficult due to the need to balance multiple loss terms, such as PDE residuals
and boundary conditions, which often have conflicting objectives and vastly
different curvatures. Existing methods address this issue by manipulating
gradients before optimization (a "pre-combine" strategy). We argue that this
approach is fundamentally limited, as forcing a single optimizer to process
gradients from spectrally heterogeneous loss landscapes disrupts its internal
preconditioning. In this work, we introduce AutoBalance, a novel "post-combine"
training paradigm. AutoBalance assigns an independent adaptive optimizer to
each loss component and aggregates the resulting preconditioned updates
afterwards. Extensive experiments on challenging PDE benchmarks show that
AutoBalance consistently outperforms existing frameworks, achieving significant
reductions in solution error, as measured by both the MSE and $L^{\infty}$
norms. Moreover, AutoBalance is orthogonal to and complementary with other
popular PINN methodologies, amplifying their effectiveness on demanding
benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有基于硬标签的模型提取攻击在深度增加时假设不现实，需要指数级查询，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出跨层提取方法，通过利用跨层神经元交互来提取信息，而不是直接提取特定神经元的秘密参数。

Result: 新方法显著降低了查询复杂度，缓解了现有模型提取方法的局限性。

Conclusion: 跨层提取技术为深度神经网络模型提取提供了更实用的解决方案，克服了现有方法在深度增加时的指数级查询成本问题。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have attracted significant attention, and their
internal models are now considered valuable intellectual assets. Extracting
these internal models through access to a DNN is conceptually similar to
extracting a secret key via oracle access to a block cipher. Consequently,
cryptanalytic techniques, particularly differential-like attacks, have been
actively explored recently. ReLU-based DNNs are the most commonly and widely
deployed architectures. While early works (e.g., Crypto 2020, Eurocrypt 2024)
assume access to exact output logits, which are usually invisible, more recent
works (e.g., Asiacrypt 2024, Eurocrypt 2025) focus on the hard-label setting,
where only the final classification result (e.g., "dog" or "car") is available
to the attacker. Notably, Carlini et al. (Eurocrypt 2025) demonstrated that
model extraction is feasible in polynomial time even under this restricted
setting.
  In this paper, we first show that the assumptions underlying their attack
become increasingly unrealistic as the attack-target depth grows. In practice,
satisfying these assumptions requires an exponential number of queries with
respect to the attack depth, implying that the attack does not always run in
polynomial time. To address this critical limitation, we propose a novel attack
method called CrossLayer Extraction. Instead of directly extracting the secret
parameters (e.g., weights and biases) of a specific neuron, which incurs
exponential cost, we exploit neuron interactions across layers to extract this
information from deeper layers. This technique significantly reduces query
complexity and mitigates the limitations of existing model extraction
approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不规则采样和缺失值是时间序列生成的主要挑战，现有方法处理这些不规则性时效果不佳且计算成本高。ImagenTime模型虽然展示了强大的生成能力，但简单掩码处理会破坏自然邻域关系。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 使用时间序列变换器补全不规则序列，创建自然邻域；2) 使用带掩码的视觉扩散模型，减少对补全值的依赖。

Result: 实现了最先进的性能，判别分数相对提升70%，计算成本相对降低85%。

Conclusion: 该方法结合了补全和掩码的优势，能够高效生成真实的时间序列数据，在医疗、金融和科学领域具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Generating realistic time series data is critical for applications in
healthcare, finance, and science. However, irregular sampling and missing
values present significant challenges. While prior methods address these
irregularities, they often yield suboptimal results and incur high
computational costs. Recent advances in regular time series generation, such as
the diffusion-based ImagenTime model, demonstrate strong, fast, and scalable
generative capabilities by transforming time series into image representations,
making them a promising solution. However, extending ImagenTime to irregular
sequences using simple masking introduces "unnatural" neighborhoods, where
missing values replaced by zeros disrupt the learning process. To overcome
this, we propose a novel two-step framework: first, a Time Series Transformer
completes irregular sequences, creating natural neighborhoods; second, a
vision-based diffusion model with masking minimizes dependence on the completed
values. This approach leverages the strengths of both completion and masking,
enabling robust and efficient generation of realistic time series. Our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, achieving a relative improvement in
discriminative score by $70\%$ and in computational cost by $85\%$. Code is at

Motivation: 传统目标条件强化学习中的状态表示可能包含外生噪声且依赖于具体表示形式，需要一种更本质、更鲁棒的状态表示方法。

Method: 开发双目标表示方法，用状态到所有其他状态的时序距离集合来表征状态，该方法可结合现有GCRL算法使用。

Result: 在OGBench任务套件的20个状态和像素任务上，双目标表示方法一致提升了离线目标达成性能。

Conclusion: 双目标表示提供了一种内在动态不变且能过滤外生噪声的有效状态表示方法，显著提升了目标条件强化学习的性能。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce dual goal representations for goal-conditioned
reinforcement learning (GCRL). A dual goal representation characterizes a state
by "the set of temporal distances from all other states"; in other words, it
encodes a state through its relations to every other state, measured by
temporal distance. This representation provides several appealing theoretical
properties. First, it depends only on the intrinsic dynamics of the environment
and is invariant to the original state representation. Second, it contains
provably sufficient information to recover an optimal goal-reaching policy,
while being able to filter out exogenous noise. Based on this concept, we
develop a practical goal representation learning method that can be combined
with any existing GCRL algorithm. Through diverse experiments on the OGBench
task suite, we empirically show that dual goal representations consistently
improve offline goal-reaching performance across 20 state- and pixel-based
tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理异构领域的因果发现问题，整合专家反馈并学习复杂的因果模型分布。

Abstract: Bayesian causal discovery benefits from prior information elicited from
domain experts, and in heterogeneous domains any prior knowledge would be badly
needed. However, so far prior elicitation approaches have assumed a single
causal graph and hence are not suited to heterogeneous domains. We propose a
causal elicitation strategy for heterogeneous settings, based on Bayesian
experimental design (BED) principles, and a variational mixture structure
learning (VaMSL) method -- extending the earlier differentiable Bayesian
structure learning (DiBS) method -- to iteratively infer mixtures of causal
Bayesian networks (CBNs). We construct an informative graph prior incorporating
elicited expert feedback in the inference of mixtures of CBNs. Our proposed
method successfully produces a set of alternative causal models (mixture
components or clusters), and achieves an improved structure learning
performance on heterogeneous synthetic data when informed by a simulated
expert. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach is capable of capturing
complex distributions in a breast cancer database.

Abstract: Function regression/approximation is a fundamental application of machine
learning. Neural networks (NNs) can be easily trained for function regression
using a sufficient number of neurons and epochs. The forward-forward learning
algorithm is a novel approach for training neural networks without
backpropagation, and is well suited for implementation in neuromorphic
computing and physical analogs for neural networks. To the best of the authors'
knowledge, the Forward Forward paradigm of training and inferencing NNs is
currently only restricted to classification tasks. This paper introduces a new
methodology for approximating functions (function regression) using the
Forward-Forward algorithm. Furthermore, the paper evaluates the developed
methodology on univariate and multivariate functions, and provides preliminary
studies of extending the proposed Forward-Forward regression to Kolmogorov
Arnold Networks, and Deep Physical Neural Networks.

Result: 估计了各州特定的传播和恢复参数以及时变再生数(R_t)，结果显示各地区传播行为存在显著差异，与疫苗接种率和主要大流行阶段的时间模式相关。

Conclusion: 证明了PINNs在局部化、长期流行病学建模中的实用性，为理解疾病动态和评估干预措施提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for quantitative modeling and
analysis to understand real-world disease dynamics. In particular, post hoc
analyses using compartmental models offer valuable insights into the
effectiveness of public health interventions, such as vaccination strategies
and containment policies. However, such compartmental models like SIR
(Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) often face limitations in directly
incorporating noisy observational data. In this work, we employ
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve the inverse problem of the
SIR model using infection data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). Our main
contribution is a fine-grained, spatio-temporal analysis of COVID-19 dynamics
across all German federal states over a three-year period. We estimate
state-specific transmission and recovery parameters and time-varying
reproduction number (R_t) to track the pandemic progression. The results
highlight strong variations in transmission behavior across regions, revealing
correlations with vaccination uptake and temporal patterns associated with
major pandemic phases. Our findings demonstrate the utility of PINNs in
localized, long-term epidemiological modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明LLM推理能够提升对防御规范的遵循，从而增强对越狱攻击的鲁棒性，但这种测试时计算的好处在面对梯度或多模态攻击时会减弱。本文旨在填补这一空白，证明推理计算在这些情况下仍能带来益处。

Method: 提出RICH假设，通过组合泛化理论解释推理计算防御的机制，并在视觉语言模型和多种攻击类型上进行实证验证，分析推理计算、基础模型鲁棒性和组合泛化之间的关系。

Result: 实验表明，如果OOD数据的规范遵循通过组合泛化解锁，测试时计算能够带来鲁棒性收益，而RL微调和长时间推理并非关键因素。通过提示增强防御规范强调，能够降低对抗性预训练VLM上基于梯度的多模态攻击成功率。

improves satisfaction of model specifications designed to thwart attacks,
resulting in a correlation between reasoning effort and robustness to
jailbreaks. However, this benefit of test compute fades when attackers are
given access to gradients or multimodal inputs. We address this gap, clarifying
that inference-compute offers benefits even in such cases. Our approach argues
that compositional generalization, through which OOD data is understandable via
its in-distribution (ID) components, enables adherence to defensive
specifications on adversarially OOD inputs. Namely, we posit the Robustness
from Inference Compute Hypothesis (RICH): inference-compute defenses profit as
the model's training data better reflects the attacked data's components. We
empirically support this hypothesis across vision language model and attack
types, finding robustness gains from test-time compute if specification
following on OOD data is unlocked by compositional generalization, while RL
finetuning and protracted reasoning are not critical. For example, increasing
emphasis on defensive specifications via prompting lowers the success rate of
gradient-based multimodal attacks on VLMs robustified by adversarial
pretraining, but this same intervention provides no such benefit to
not-robustified models. This correlation of inference-compute's robustness
benefit with base model robustness is the rich-get-richer dynamic of the RICH:
attacked data components are more ID for robustified models, aiding
compositional generalization to OOD data. Accordingly, we advise layering
train-time and test-time defenses to obtain their synergistic benefit.

*Giovanni Donghi,Daniele Zambon,Luca Pasa,Cesare Alippi,Nicolò Navarin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种简单有效的在线持续图学习方法：使用固定的随机初始化编码器生成节点嵌入，仅在线训练轻量级分类器，有效缓解灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线持续图学习面临灾难性遗忘的主要障碍，节点逐个到达且分布可能随时漂移，无法进行离线训练。

Method: 采用固定的随机初始化编码器聚合邻域信息生成节点嵌入，仅在线训练轻量级分类器，冻结编码器以避免表示参数漂移。

Result: 在多个OCGL基准测试中，该方法始终优于最先进方法，提升高达30%，性能接近离线联合训练的上界。

Conclusion: 在OCGL中，通过架构简单性和稳定性，无需复杂重放或正则化即可最小化灾难性遗忘。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is one of the main obstacles for Online Continual
Graph Learning (OCGL), where nodes arrive one by one, distribution drifts may
occur at any time and offline training on task-specific subgraphs is not
feasible. In this work, we explore a surprisingly simple yet highly effective
approach for OCGL: we use a fixed, randomly initialized encoder to generate
robust and expressive node embeddings by aggregating neighborhood information,
training online only a lightweight classifier. By freezing the encoder, we
eliminate drifts of the representation parameters, a key source of forgetting,
obtaining embeddings that are both expressive and stable. When evaluated across
several OCGL benchmarks, despite its simplicity and lack of memory buffer, this
approach yields consistent gains over state-of-the-art methods, with surprising
improvements of up to 30% and performance often approaching that of the joint
offline-training upper bound. These results suggest that in OCGL, catastrophic
forgetting can be minimized without complex replay or regularization by
embracing architectural simplicity and stability.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型处理数值数据需要大量推理token，且数字被分割成多个token，限制了模型处理复杂计算问题的能力。

Method: 提出BitTokens编码策略，将任何数字使用IEEE 754二进制浮点表示嵌入到单个token中，满足高效单token数字编码的需求。

Result: 实验表明BitTokens使小型语言模型能近乎完美地学习基本算术运算算法，显著提升计算效率。

Conclusion: BitTokens扩展了语言模型可解决问题的长度和复杂度，为科学和工程应用提供了更有效的数值处理能力。

Abstract: To drive progress in science and engineering, large language models (LLMs)
must be able to process large amounts of numerical data and solve long
calculations efficiently. This is currently only possible through the use of
external tools or extensive reasoning chains, either limiting the numerical
intuition of LLMs or limiting the length of problems they can solve. We show
that frontier LLMs require excessive amounts of reasoning tokens to solve even
basic calculations, which is exacerbated by their tokenization strategies that
split single numbers into multiple tokens. This motivates the need for
efficient and effective single-token number encodings. We introduce a set of
desiderata for such encodings and show that existing approaches fail to fulfill
them. To address these shortcomings, we propose BitTokens, a novel tokenization
strategy that embeds any number into a single token using its IEEE 754 binary
floating-point representation. Through extensive experiments we show that our
BitTokens allow even small language models to learn algorithms that solve basic
arithmetic operations nearly perfectly. This newly gained efficiency could
expand the length and complexity of problems language models can solve.

Abstract: In recent years, attention-like mechanisms have been used to great success in
the space of large language models, unlocking scaling potential to a previously
unthinkable extent. "Attention Is All You Need" famously claims RNN cells are
not needed in conjunction with attention. We challenge this view. In this
paper, we point to existing proofs that architectures with fully parallelizable
forward or backward passes cannot represent classes of problems specifically
interesting for long-running agentic tasks. We further conjecture a critical
time t beyond which non-recurrence-complete models fail to aggregate inputs
correctly, with concrete implications for agentic systems (e.g., software
engineering agents). To address this, we introduce a recurrence-complete
architecture and train it on GitHub-derived action sequences. Loss follows a
power law in the trained sequence length while the parameter count remains
fixed. Moreover, longer-sequence training always amortizes its linearly
increasing wall-time cost, yielding lower loss as a function of wall time.

Abstract: Alarm data is pivotal in curbing fault behavior in Wind Turbines (WTs) and
forms the backbone for advancedpredictive monitoring systems. Traditionally,
research cohorts have been confined to utilizing alarm data solelyas a
diagnostic tool, merely indicative of unhealthy status. However, this study
aims to offer a transformativeleap towards preempting alarms, preventing alarms
from triggering altogether, and consequently avertingimpending failures. Our
proposed Alarm Forecasting and Classification (AFC) framework is designed on
twosuccessive modules: first, the regression module based on long short-term
memory (LSTM) for time-series alarmforecasting, and thereafter, the
classification module to implement alarm tagging on the forecasted alarm.
Thisway, the entire alarm taxonomy can be forecasted reliably rather than a few
specific alarms. 14 Senvion MM82turbines with an operational period of 5 years
are used as a case study; the results demonstrated 82%, 52%,and 41% accurate
forecasts for 10, 20, and 30 min alarm forecasts, respectively. The results
substantiateanticipating and averting alarms, which is significant in curbing
alarm frequency and enhancing operationalefficiency through proactive

Abstract: Attention is a core operation in numerous machine learning and artificial

using FlashAttention algorithm, in vector processors, particularly those based
on the RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA). This work represents the
first effort to vectorize FlashAttention, minimizing scalar code and
simplifying the computational complexity of evaluating exponentials needed by
softmax used in attention. By utilizing a low-cost approximation for
exponentials in floating-point arithmetic, we reduce the cost of computing the
exponential function without the need to extend baseline vector ISA with new
custom instructions. Also, appropriate tiling strategies are explored with the
goal to improve memory locality. Experimental results highlight the scalability
of our approach, demonstrating significant performance gains with the
vectorized implementations when processing attention layers in practical

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer architectures offer
strengths for modeling temporal data: CNNs excel at capturing local patterns
and translational invariances, while transformers effectively model long-range
dependencies via self-attention. This paper proposes a hybrid architecture
integrating convolutional feature extraction with a temporal fusion transformer
(TFT) backbone to enhance multivariate time series forecasting. The CNN module
first applies a hierarchy of one-dimensional convolutional layers to distill
salient local patterns from raw input sequences, reducing noise and
dimensionality. The resulting feature maps are then fed into the TFT, which
applies multi-head attention to capture both short- and long-term dependencies
and to weigh relevant covariates adaptively. We evaluate the CNN-TFT on a
hydroelectric natural flow time series dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate that CNN-TFT outperforms well-established deep learning models,
with a mean absolute percentage error of up to 2.2%. The explainability of the
model is obtained by a proposed Shapley additive explanations with multi-head
attention weights (SHAP-MHAW). Our novel architecture, named CNN-TFT-SHAP-MHAW,
is promising for applications requiring high-fidelity, multivariate time series
forecasts, being available for future analysis at

Conclusion: 提出的创新机器学习方法有助于实施降低破产成本的政策，为银行风险管理提供更准确的预测工具。

Abstract: Context: Financial system stability is determined by the condition of the
banking system. A bank failure can destroy the stability of the financial
system, as banks are subject to systemic risk, affecting not only individual
banks but also segments or the entire financial system. Calculating the
probability of a bank going bankrupt is one way to ensure the banking system is
safe and sound. Existing literature and limitations: Statistical models, such
as Altman's Z-Score, are one of the common techniques for developing a
bankruptcy prediction model. However, statistical methods rely on rigid and
sometimes irrelevant assumptions, which can result in low forecast accuracy.
New approaches are necessary. Objective of the research: Bankruptcy models are
developed using machine learning techniques, such as logistic regression (LR),
random forest (RF), and support vector machines (SVM). According to several
studies, machine learning is also more accurate and effective than statistical
methods for categorising and forecasting banking risk management. Present
Research: The commercial bank data are derived from the annual financial
statements of 44 active banks and 21 bankrupt banks in Turkey from 1994 to
2004, and the rural bank data are derived from the quarterly financial reports
of 43 active and 43 bankrupt rural banks in Indonesia between 2013 and 2019.
Five rural banks in Indonesia have also been selected to demonstrate the
feasibility of analysing bank bankruptcy trends. Findings and implications: The
results of the research experiments show that RF can forecast data from
commercial banks with a 90% accuracy rate. Furthermore, the three machine
learning methods proposed accurately predict the likelihood of rural bank
bankruptcy. Contribution and Conclusion: The proposed innovative machine
learning approach help to implement policies that reduce the costs of
bankruptcy.

Motivation: 传统ACOPF求解器计算成本高，机器学习方法虽然能加速计算但难以扩展到不同规模的电网和适应拓扑变化，需要昂贵的重新训练。

Method: 使用混合异构消息传递神经网络，将母线、发电机、负荷、并联电抗器、输电线路和变压器建模为不同的节点或边类型，结合可扩展的Transformer模型处理长程依赖关系。

Result: 在默认拓扑上实现小于1%的最优性差距；在未见过的数千个拓扑上零样本应用时实现小于3%的最优性差距；在较小电网上预训练可改善较大电网的结果；计算速度比内点法快1000-10000倍。

Conclusion: HH-MPNN为实时电力系统操作提供了实用且可泛化的机器学习解决方案，能够适应不同电网规模和拓扑变化。

Abstract: AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) is computationally expensive for large-scale
power systems, with conventional solvers requiring prohibitive solution times.
Machine learning approaches offer computational speedups but struggle with
scalability and topology adaptability without expensive retraining. To enable
scalability across grid sizes and adaptability to topology changes, we propose
a Hybrid Heterogeneous Message Passing Neural Network (HH-MPNN). HH-MPNN models
buses, generators, loads, shunts, transmission lines and transformers as
distinct node or edge types, combined with a scalable transformer model for
handling long-range dependencies. On grids from 14 to 2,000 buses, HH-MPNN
achieves less than 1% optimality gap on default topologies. Applied zero-shot
to thousands of unseen topologies, HH-MPNN achieves less than 3% optimality gap
despite training only on default topologies. Pre-training on smaller grids also
improves results on a larger grid. Computational speedups reach 1,000x to
10,000x compared to interior point solvers. These results advance practical,
generalizable machine learning for real-time power system operations.

TL;DR: 提出SaFeR-VLM框架，通过安全对齐的强化学习将安全性直接嵌入多模态推理过程，解决现有方法只在输出层面防御而无法约束推理过程的安全风险问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大推理模型在跨模态推理方面表现出色，但在对抗性或不安全提示下会放大安全风险，这种现象被称为"推理税"。现有防御方法主要在输出层面起作用，无法约束推理过程，使模型面临隐性风险。

Method: 提出SaFeR-VLM框架，包含四个组件：(I) QI-Safe-10K数据集，强调安全关键和推理敏感案例；(II) 安全感知的rollout，对不安全生成进行反思和修正而非丢弃；(III) 结构化奖励建模，具有多维加权标准和幻觉、矛盾的明确惩罚；(IV) GRPO优化，强化安全和修正的轨迹。

Conclusion: SaFeR-VLM将安全性从被动保障转变为推理的主动驱动力，支持超越表面过滤的动态和可解释安全决策，实现了可扩展和泛化的安全感知推理。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Reasoning Models (MLRMs) demonstrate impressive cross-modal
reasoning but often amplify safety risks under adversarial or unsafe prompts, a
phenomenon we call the \textit{Reasoning Tax}. Existing defenses mainly act at
the output level and do not constrain the reasoning process, leaving models
exposed to implicit risks. In this paper, we propose SaFeR-VLM, a
safety-aligned reinforcement learning framework that embeds safety directly
into multimodal reasoning. The framework integrates four components: (I)
QI-Safe-10K, a curated dataset emphasizing safety-critical and
reasoning-sensitive cases; (II) safety-aware rollout, where unsafe generations
undergo reflection and correction instead of being discarded; (III) structured
reward modeling with multi-dimensional weighted criteria and explicit penalties
for hallucinations and contradictions; and (IV) GRPO optimization, which
reinforces both safe and corrected trajectories. This unified design shifts
safety from a passive safeguard to an active driver of reasoning, enabling
scalable and generalizable safety-aware reasoning. SaFeR-VLM further
demonstrates robustness against both explicit and implicit risks, supporting
dynamic and interpretable safety decisions beyond surface-level filtering.
SaFeR-VLM-3B achieves average performance $70.13$ and $78.97$ on safety and
helpfulness across six benchmarks, surpassing both same-scale and $>10\times$
larger models such as Skywork-R1V3-38B, Qwen2.5VL-72B, and GLM4.5V-106B.
Remarkably, SaFeR-VLM-7B benefits from its increased scale to surpass
GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash by \num{6.47} and \num{16.76} points
respectively on safety metrics, achieving this improvement without any
degradation in helpfulness performance. Our codes are available at

Conclusion: SpherePair方法通过角约束嵌入有效解决了深度约束聚类问题，具有良好的理论保证和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Constrained clustering integrates domain knowledge through pairwise
constraints. However, existing deep constrained clustering (DCC) methods are
either limited by anchors inherent in end-to-end modeling or struggle with
learning discriminative Euclidean embedding, restricting their scalability and
real-world applicability. To avoid their respective pitfalls, we propose a
novel angular constraint embedding approach for DCC, termed SpherePair. Using
the SpherePair loss with a geometric formulation, our method faithfully encodes
pairwise constraints and leads to embeddings that are clustering-friendly in
angular space, effectively separating representation learning from clustering.
SpherePair preserves pairwise relations without conflict, removes the need to
specify the exact number of clusters, generalizes to unseen data, enables rapid
inference of the number of clusters, and is supported by rigorous theoretical
guarantees. Comparative evaluations with state-of-the-art DCC methods on
diverse benchmarks, along with empirical validation of theoretical insights,
confirm its superior performance, scalability, and overall real-world
effectiveness. Code is available at

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a key task across domains such as industry, healthcare,
and cybersecurity. Many real-world anomaly detection problems involve analyzing
multiple features over time, making time series analysis a natural approach for
such problems. While deep learning models have achieved strong performance in
this field, their trend to exhibit high energy consumption limits their
deployment in resource-constrained environments such as IoT devices, edge
computing platforms, and wearables. To address this challenge, this paper
introduces the \textit{Vacuum Spiker algorithm}, a novel Spiking Neural
Network-based method for anomaly detection in time series. It incorporates a
new detection criterion that relies on global changes in neural activity rather
than reconstruction or prediction error. It is trained using Spike
Time-Dependent Plasticity in a novel way, intended to induce changes in neural
activity when anomalies occur. A new efficient encoding scheme is also
proposed, which discretizes the input space into non-overlapping intervals,
assigning each to a single neuron. This strategy encodes information with a
single spike per time step, improving energy efficiency compared to
conventional encoding methods. Experimental results on publicly available
datasets show that the proposed algorithm achieves competitive performance
while significantly reducing energy consumption, compared to a wide set of deep
learning and machine learning baselines. Furthermore, its practical utility is
validated in a real-world case study, where the model successfully identifies
power curtailment events in a solar inverter. These results highlight its
potential for sustainable and efficient anomaly detection.

Abstract: This study explores the explainability capabilities of large language models
(LLMs), when employed to autonomously generate machine learning (ML) solutions.
We examine two classification tasks: (i) a binary classification problem
focused on predicting driver alertness states, and (ii) a multilabel
classification problem based on the yeast dataset. Three state-of-the-art LLMs
(i.e. OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude, and DeepSeek) are prompted to design
training pipelines for four common classifiers: Random Forest, XGBoost,
Multilayer Perceptron, and Long Short-Term Memory networks. The generated
models are evaluated in terms of predictive performance (recall, precision, and
F1-score) and explainability using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations).
Specifically, we measure Average SHAP Fidelity (Mean Squared Error between SHAP
approximations and model outputs) and Average SHAP Sparsity (number of features
deemed influential). The results reveal that LLMs are capable of producing
effective and interpretable models, achieving high fidelity and consistent
sparsity, highlighting their potential as automated tools for interpretable ML

Abstract: Node affinity prediction is a common task that is widely used in temporal
graph learning with applications in social and financial networks, recommender
systems, and more. Recent works have addressed this task by adapting
state-of-the-art dynamic link property prediction models to node affinity
prediction. However, simple heuristics, such as Persistent Forecast or Moving
Average, outperform these models. In this work, we analyze the challenges in
training current Temporal Graph Neural Networks for node affinity prediction
and suggest appropriate solutions. Combining the solutions, we develop NAViS -
Node Affinity prediction model using Virtual State, by exploiting the
equivalence between heuristics and state space models. While promising,
training NAViS is non-trivial. Therefore, we further introduce a novel loss
function for node affinity prediction. We evaluate NAViS on TGB and show that
it outperforms the state-of-the-art, including heuristics. Our source code is

TL;DR: 本文研究了量子神经网络中基于Fisher信息矩阵的评估指标如何有效预测训练和预测性能，发现对于无偏模型，更高的有效维度有利于训练和性能；而对于有偏模型，较低的有效维度在训练中更有益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着量子机器学习特别是量子神经网络的兴趣增长，研究基于Fisher信息矩阵的评估指标如何有效预测其训练和预测性能。

Method: 利用QNN与傅里叶模型的等价性，推导傅里叶模型的FIM解析表达式，识别控制模型有效维度的特征，构建具有可调有效维度和偏差的模型进行比较训练，并引入张量网络表示。

Result: 对于完全无偏的模型，更高的有效维度可能带来更好的可训练性和性能；而对于有偏模型，较低的有效维度在训练中可能更有益。

Conclusion: 这些发现提供了几何特性、模型-任务对齐和训练之间相互作用的具体示例，对更广泛的机器学习社区具有相关性。

Abstract: Motivated by the growing interest in quantum machine learning, in particular
quantum neural networks (QNNs), we study how recently introduced evaluation
metrics based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM) are effective for
predicting their training and prediction performance. We exploit the
equivalence between a broad class of QNNs and Fourier models, and study the
interplay between the \emph{effective dimension} and the \emph{bias} of a model
towards a given task, investigating how these affect the model's training and
performance. We show that for a model that is completely agnostic, or unbiased,
towards the function to be learned, a higher effective dimension likely results
in a better trainability and performance. On the other hand, for models that
are biased towards the function to be learned a lower effective dimension is
likely beneficial during training. To obtain these results, we derive an
analytical expression of the FIM for Fourier models and identify the features
controlling a model's effective dimension. This allows us to construct models
with tunable effective dimension and bias, and to compare their training. We
furthermore introduce a tensor network representation of the considered Fourier
models, which could be a tool of independent interest for the analysis of QNN
models. Overall, these findings provide an explicit example of the interplay
between geometrical properties, model-task alignment and training, which are
relevant for the broader machine learning community.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了分组差分注意力(GDA)，通过不平衡的注意力头分配策略，将更多头分配给信号提取组，较少头分配给噪声控制组，从而在最小计算开销下实现更强的信号保真度和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自注意力机制存在效率问题，经常将大量注意力分配给冗余或噪声上下文。差分注意力虽然解决了这一问题，但其平衡的头分配限制了表示灵活性和可扩展性。

Method: 引入不平衡的头分配策略，将注意力头分为信号保持组和噪声控制组，为信号提取分配更多头，为噪声控制分配较少头，并通过受控重复稳定噪声控制组。

Result: 大规模预训练和持续训练实验表明，GDA中的适度不平衡比率相比对称基线在泛化性和稳定性方面带来显著改进。

Conclusion: 比率感知的头分配和选择性扩展为设计可扩展、计算高效的Transformer架构提供了有效且实用的路径。

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism, while foundational to modern Transformer
architectures, suffers from a critical inefficiency: it frequently allocates
substantial attention to redundant or noisy context. Differential Attention
addressed this by using subtractive attention maps for signal and noise, but
its required balanced head allocation imposes rigid constraints on
representational flexibility and scalability.
  To overcome this, we propose Grouped Differential Attention (GDA), a novel
approach that introduces unbalanced head allocation between signal-preserving
and noise-control groups. GDA significantly enhances signal focus by
strategically assigning more heads to signal extraction and fewer to
noise-control, stabilizing the latter through controlled repetition (akin to
GQA). This design achieves stronger signal fidelity with minimal computational
overhead. We further extend this principle to group-differentiated growth, a
scalable strategy that selectively replicates only the signal-focused heads,
thereby ensuring efficient capacity expansion.
  Through large-scale pretraining and continual training experiments, we
demonstrate that moderate imbalance ratios in GDA yield substantial
improvements in generalization and stability compared to symmetric baselines.
Our results collectively establish that ratio-aware head allocation and
selective expansion offer an effective and practical path toward designing
scalable, computation-efficient Transformer architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文使用梯度流分析框架研究线性化Transformer的训练动态，发现注意力模块的训练分为两个阶段：第一阶段权重扰动帮助逃离小初始化，第二阶段键查询矩阵参与训练导致秩崩溃。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Transformer模型表现出优异的实证性能，但其训练动态的基本原理在配置特定研究之外缺乏充分描述。受语言模型在小初始化尺度下改进推理能力的实证证据启发，需要系统研究Transformer训练动态。

Method: 采用[Zhou et al. NeurIPS 2022]中建立的梯度流分析框架，系统研究线性化Transformer的训练动态，理论分析将注意力模块动态分解为两个不同阶段。

Result: 第一阶段：随机初始化的非对称权重扰动维持参数矩阵中的非退化梯度动态，促进系统逃离小初始化状态；第二阶段：先前静态的键查询矩阵积极参与训练，驱动归一化矩阵趋向渐近秩崩溃。

Conclusion: 这个两阶段框架推广了经典的方向收敛结果，为理解Transformer训练动态提供了新的理论视角。

Abstract: Although transformer-based models have shown exceptional empirical
performance, the fundamental principles governing their training dynamics are
inadequately characterized beyond configuration-specific studies. Inspired by
empirical evidence showing improved reasoning capabilities under small
initialization scales in language models, we employ the gradient flow
analytical framework established in [Zhou et al. NeurIPS 2022] to
systematically investigate linearized Transformer training dynamics. Our
theoretical analysis dissects the dynamics of attention modules into two
distinct stages. In the first stage, asymmetric weight perturbations from
random initialization sustain non-degenerate gradient dynamics in parameter
matrices, facilitating systematic escape from small initialization regimes.
Subsequently, these matrices undergo condensation, progressively aligning
toward the target orientation. In the second stage, the previously static
key-query matrices actively participate in training, driving the normalized
matrices toward asymptotic rank collapse. This two-stage framework generalizes
classical directional convergence results.

*Masih Aminbeidokhti,Heitor Rapela Medeiros,Eric Granger,Marco Pedersoli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Mixout是一种替代Dropout的随机正则化技术，通过在训练过程中概率性地将微调权重与预训练权重交换来平衡适应性和先验知识保留，在领域泛化基准测试中达到与集成方法相当的精度，同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集成微调模型虽然能提高分布偏移下的鲁棒性，但计算成本高；Dropout在预训练模型中容易过度正则化并破坏关键表示。需要一种轻量级替代方案来平衡适应性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出High-rate Mixout方法，使用高掩码概率（ViT为0.9，ResNet为0.8）在训练过程中随机将微调权重替换为预训练权重，惩罚偏离预训练参数的行为。

Result: 在五个领域泛化基准测试（PACS、VLCS、OfficeHome、TerraIncognita、DomainNet）上，使用ResNet和ViT架构，High-rate Mixout达到了与集成方法相当的域外精度，同时将梯度计算减少45%，梯度内存使用减少90%。

Conclusion: 高掩码率的Mixout在领域泛化任务中既能保持与集成方法相当的性能，又能显著降低计算开销，是一种有效的轻量级正则化方法。

Abstract: Ensembling fine-tuned models initialized from powerful pre-trained weights is
a common strategy to improve robustness under distribution shifts, but it comes
with substantial computational costs due to the need to train and store
multiple models. Dropout offers a lightweight alternative by simulating
ensembles through random neuron deactivation; however, when applied to
pre-trained models, it tends to over-regularize and disrupt critical
representations necessary for generalization. In this work, we investigate
Mixout, a stochastic regularization technique that provides an alternative to
Dropout for domain generalization. Rather than deactivating neurons, Mixout
mitigates overfitting by probabilistically swapping a subset of fine-tuned
weights with their pre-trained counterparts during training, thereby
maintaining a balance between adaptation and retention of prior knowledge. Our
study reveals that achieving strong performance with Mixout on domain
generalization benchmarks requires a notably high masking probability of 0.9
for ViTs and 0.8 for ResNets. While this may seem like a simple adjustment, it
yields two key advantages for domain generalization: (1) higher masking rates
more strongly penalize deviations from the pre-trained parameters, promoting
better generalization to unseen domains; and (2) high-rate masking
substantially reduces computational overhead, cutting gradient computation by
up to 45% and gradient memory usage by up to 90%. Experiments across five
domain generalization benchmarks, PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, TerraIncognita, and
DomainNet, using ResNet and ViT architectures, show that our approach,
High-rate Mixout, achieves out-of-domain accuracy comparable to ensemble-based
methods while significantly reducing training costs.

TL;DR: GMixout是一种改进的随机正则化方法，通过动态权重锚点和可控的掩码频率，在微调视觉基础模型时同时提升域内准确性和分布偏移下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微调方法在提升域内准确性的同时会损害模型在分布偏移下的鲁棒性。本文旨在通过改进Mixout正则化方法来解决这一权衡问题。

Method: 提出GMixout方法：使用指数移动平均快照作为动态锚点替代固定锚点；引入显式的重采样频率超参数控制掩码周期；采用稀疏核实现仅更新小部分参数，无推理开销。

Result: 在ImageNet、DomainNet、iWildCam和CIFAR100-C等多个基准测试中，GMixout在保持域内准确性提升的同时，在分布偏移下的鲁棒性超越了Model Soups和参数高效微调基线方法。

Conclusion: GMixout通过动态锚点和可控掩码机制，有效解决了微调视觉基础模型时准确性与鲁棒性之间的权衡问题，在多个数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: Finetuning vision foundation models often improves in-domain accuracy but
comes at the cost of robustness under distribution shift. We revisit Mixout, a
stochastic regularizer that intermittently replaces finetuned weights with
their pretrained reference, through the lens of a single-run, weight-sharing
implicit ensemble. This perspective reveals three key levers that govern
robustness: the \emph{masking anchor}, \emph{resampling frequency}, and
\emph{mask sparsity}. Guided by this analysis, we introduce GMixout, which (i)
replaces the fixed anchor with an exponential moving-average snapshot that
adapts during training, and (ii) regulates masking period via an explicit
resampling-frequency hyperparameter. Our sparse-kernel implementation updates
only a small fraction of parameters with no inference-time overhead, enabling
training on consumer-grade GPUs. Experiments on benchmarks covering covariate
shift, corruption, and class imbalance, ImageNet / ImageNet-LT, DomainNet,
iWildCam, and CIFAR100-C, GMixout consistently improves in-domain accuracy
beyond zero-shot performance while surpassing both Model Soups and strong
parameter-efficient finetuning baselines under distribution shift.

Abstract: Analytics play an important role in modern business. Companies adapt data

contributing factor to start and end a project that are data dependent. Data
science and Machine learning life cycles comprises of series of steps that are

in a traditional data science life cycle to start the process again after
reaching the end of cycle. This paper suggests a new technique to incorporate
data science life cycle to business problems that have a clear end goal. A new
technique called spiral technique is introduced to emphasize versatility,
agility and iterative approach to business processes.

Abstract: Zero-shot quantization aims to learn a quantized model from a pre-trained
full-precision model with no access to original real training data. The common
idea in zero-shot quantization approaches is to generate synthetic data for
quantizing the full-precision model. While it is well-known that deep neural
networks with low sharpness have better generalization ability, none of the
previous zero-shot quantization works considers the sharpness of the quantized
model as a criterion for generating training data. This paper introduces a
novel methodology that takes into account quantized model sharpness in
synthetic data generation to enhance generalization. Specifically, we first
demonstrate that sharpness minimization can be attained by maximizing gradient
matching between the reconstruction loss gradients computed on synthetic and
real validation data, under certain assumptions. We then circumvent the problem
of the gradient matching without real validation set by approximating it with
the gradient matching between each generated sample and its neighbors.
Experimental evaluations on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art techniques in
low-bit quantization settings.

Result: 实验结果显示现有方法在真实设置下表现差，而FedCCCU方法持续优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FedCCCU为现实世界联邦遗忘提供了有效的公平感知解决方案。

Abstract: Machine unlearning is critical for enforcing data deletion rights like the
"right to be forgotten." As a decentralized paradigm, Federated Learning (FL)
also requires unlearning, but realistic implementations face two major
challenges. First, fairness in Federated Unlearning (FU) is often overlooked.
Exact unlearning methods typically force all clients into costly retraining,
even those uninvolved. Approximate approaches, using gradient ascent or
distillation, make coarse interventions that can unfairly degrade performance
for clients with only retained data. Second, most FU evaluations rely on
synthetic data assumptions (IID/non-IID) that ignore real-world heterogeneity.
These unrealistic benchmarks obscure the true impact of unlearning and limit
the applicability of current methods. We first conduct a comprehensive
benchmark of existing FU methods under realistic data heterogeneity and
fairness conditions. We then propose a novel, fairness-aware FU approach,
Federated Cross-Client-Constrains Unlearning (FedCCCU), to explicitly address
both challenges. FedCCCU offers a practical and scalable solution for
real-world FU. Experimental results show that existing methods perform poorly
in realistic settings, while our approach consistently outperforms them.

Motivation: 现有分子表示学习方法需要配对的2D和3D数据来训练，但在某些场景下某个模态可能不可用或计算成本高，这限制了应用。

Conclusion: FlexMol框架能够灵活处理单模态输入，在分子表示学习任务中取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Molecular representation learning plays a crucial role in advancing
applications such as drug discovery and material design. Existing work
leverages 2D and 3D modalities of molecular information for pre-training,
aiming to capture comprehensive structural and geometric insights. However,
these methods require paired 2D and 3D molecular data to train the model
effectively and prevent it from collapsing into a single modality, posing
limitations in scenarios where a certain modality is unavailable or
computationally expensive to generate. To overcome this limitation, we propose
FlexMol, a flexible molecule pre-training framework that learns unified
molecular representations while supporting single-modality input. Specifically,
inspired by the unified structure in vision-language models, our approach
employs separate models for 2D and 3D molecular data, leverages parameter
sharing to improve computational efficiency, and utilizes a decoder to generate
features for the missing modality. This enables a multistage continuous
learning process where both modalities contribute collaboratively during
training, while ensuring robustness when only one modality is available during
inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlexMol achieves superior
performance across a wide range of molecular property prediction tasks, and we
also empirically demonstrate its effectiveness with incomplete data. Our code

Conclusion: COMPASS通过在实际用户导向领域中扎根推理和规划，提供了一个直接衡量智能体在真实任务中优化用户偏好能力的基准，连接理论进展与现实影响。

Abstract: Real-world large language model (LLM) agents must master strategic tool use
and user preference optimization through multi-turn interactions to assist
users with complex planning tasks. We introduce COMPASS (Constrained
Optimization through Multi-turn Planning and Strategic Solutions), a benchmark
that evaluates agents on realistic travel-planning scenarios. We cast travel
planning as a constrained preference optimization problem, where agents must
satisfy hard constraints while simultaneously optimizing soft user preferences.
To support this, we build a realistic travel database covering transportation,
accommodation, and ticketing for 20 U.S. National Parks, along with a
comprehensive tool ecosystem that mirrors commercial booking platforms.
Evaluating state-of-the-art models, we uncover two critical gaps: (i) an
acceptable-optimal gap, where agents reliably meet constraints but fail to
optimize preferences, and (ii) a plan-coordination gap, where performance
collapses on multi-service (flight and hotel) coordination tasks, especially
for open-source models. By grounding reasoning and planning in a practical,
user-facing domain, COMPASS provides a benchmark that directly measures an
agent's ability to optimize user preferences in realistic tasks, bridging
theoretical advances with real-world impact.

Result: GP-BO在11分钟内达到0.96平衡准确率，TPE在15分钟内达到0.97，远优于需要143次试验和1680分钟的网格搜索，以及GPU上AutoSpeech 2020基准的0.85准确率

Conclusion: 结合预训练编码器的高效超参数优化可以在普通CPU上实现有竞争力的语音情感识别性能，并具有良好的跨语言泛化能力

Abstract: We propose a workflow for speech emotion recognition (SER) that combines
pre-trained representations with automated hyperparameter optimisation (HPO).
Using SpeechBrain wav2vec2-base model fine-tuned on IEMOCAP as the encoder, we
compare two HPO strategies, Gaussian Process Bayesian Optimisation (GP-BO) and
Tree-structured Parzen Estimators (TPE), under an identical four-dimensional
search space and 15-trial budget, with balanced class accuracy (BCA) on the
German EmoDB corpus as the objective. All experiments run on 8 CPU cores with
32 GB RAM. GP-BO achieves 0.96 BCA in 11 minutes, and TPE (Hyperopt
implementation) attains 0.97 in 15 minutes. In contrast, grid search requires
143 trials and 1,680 minutes to exceed 0.9 BCA, and the best AutoSpeech 2020
baseline reports only 0.85 in 30 minutes on GPU. For cross-lingual
generalisation, an EmoDB-trained HPO-tuned model improves zero-shot accuracy by
0.25 on CREMA-D and 0.26 on RAVDESS. Results show that efficient HPO with
pre-trained encoders delivers competitive SER on commodity CPUs. Source code to

Conclusion: 提出的非监督方法能够有效构建角度功率图，在现实网络条件下实现合理定位精度，为无线电资源管理提供可行解决方案。

Abstract: Channel state information (CSI) acquisition is a challenging problem in
massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks. Radio maps provide a
promising solution for radio resource management by reducing online CSI
acquisition. However, conventional approaches for radio map construction
require location-labeled CSI data, which is challenging in practice. This paper
investigates unsupervised angular power map construction based on large
timescale CSI data collected in a massive MIMO network without location labels.
A hidden Markov model (HMM) is built to connect the hidden trajectory of a
mobile with the CSI evolution of a massive MIMO channel. As a result, the
mobile location can be estimated, enabling the construction of an angular power
map. We show that under uniform rectilinear mobility with Poisson-distributed
base stations (BSs), the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for localization error
can vanish at any signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), whereas when BSs are confined
to a limited region, the error remains nonzero even with infinite independent
measurements. Based on reference signal received power (RSRP) data collected in
a real multi-cell massive MIMO network, an average localization error of 18
meters can be achieved although measurements are mainly obtained from a single
serving cell.

Conclusion: HTME通过增强特征提取能力，使Transformer能够更好地理解时间序列，在保持模型轻量化的同时实现了更好的预测性能。

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have achieved impressive results in time series
forecasting. However, existing Transformers still exhibit limitations in
sequence modeling as they tend to overemphasize temporal dependencies. This
incurs additional computational overhead without yielding corresponding
performance gains. We find that the performance of Transformers is highly
dependent on the embedding method used to learn effective representations. To
address this issue, we extract multivariate features to augment the effective
information captured in the embedding layer, yielding multidimensional
embeddings that convey richer and more meaningful sequence representations.
These representations enable Transformer-based forecasters to better understand
the series. Specifically, we introduce Hybrid Temporal and Multivariate
Embeddings (HTME). The HTME extractor integrates a lightweight temporal feature
extraction module with a carefully designed multivariate feature extraction
module to provide complementary features, thereby achieving a balance between
model complexity and performance. By combining HTME with the Transformer
architecture, we present HTMformer, leveraging the enhanced feature extraction

### [206] [Non-Stationary Online Structured Prediction with Surrogate Losses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07086)
*Shinsaku Sakaue,Han Bao,Yuzhou Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文针对非平稳环境中的在线结构化预测问题，提出了一种新的遗憾界分析框架，通过结合在线梯度下降的动态遗憾界和利用代理间隙的技术，实现了对累积目标损失的改进保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的在线结构化预测方法在平稳环境中能获得与时间范围无关的有限遗憾界，但在非平稳环境中这些保证会失效，因为固定估计器可能产生线性增长的代理损失。

Method: 通过合成在线梯度下降(OGD)的动态遗憾界与利用代理间隙的技术，并引入新的Polyak风格学习率，扩展到卷积Fenchel-Young损失的更广泛问题类别。

Result: 证明了形式为$F_T + C(1 + P_T)$的累积目标损失界，其中$F_T$是任意比较器序列的累积代理损失，$P_T$是其路径长度，$C>0$是常数。该界仅通过$F_T$和$P_T$依赖于$T$。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在非平稳环境中提供了更强的保证，通过下界证明了$F_T$和$P_T$的依赖关系是紧的，新的Polyak风格学习率在实验中表现出良好性能。

Abstract: Online structured prediction, including online classification as a special
case, is the task of sequentially predicting labels from input features.
Therein the surrogate regret -- the cumulative excess of the target loss (e.g.,
0-1 loss) over the surrogate loss (e.g., logistic loss) of the fixed best
estimator -- has gained attention, particularly because it often admits a
finite bound independent of the time horizon $T$. However, such guarantees
break down in non-stationary environments, where every fixed estimator may
incur the surrogate loss growing linearly with $T$. We address this by proving
a bound of the form $F_T + C(1 + P_T)$ on the cumulative target loss, where
$F_T$ is the cumulative surrogate loss of any comparator sequence, $P_T$ is its
path length, and $C > 0$ is some constant. This bound depends on $T$ only
through $F_T$ and $P_T$, often yielding much stronger guarantees in
non-stationary environments. Our core idea is to synthesize the dynamic regret
bound of the online gradient descent (OGD) with the technique of exploiting the
surrogate gap. Our analysis also sheds light on a new Polyak-style learning
rate for OGD, which systematically offers target-loss guarantees and exhibits
promising empirical performance. We further extend our approach to a broader
class of problems via the convolutional Fenchel--Young loss. Finally, we prove
a lower bound showing that the dependence on $F_T$ and $P_T$ is tight.

*Yunzhen Yao,Lie He,Michael Gastpar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了保形预测在回归问题中的效率，建立了预测集长度与理想区间长度偏差的非渐近界，揭示了在不同误覆盖水平α下的收敛速率相变现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保形预测虽然能提供覆盖保证，但其信息量取决于预测集的效率（通常用预期大小衡量）。先前工作通常将误覆盖水平α视为固定常数，本文旨在更全面地分析效率对训练集大小、校准集大小和误覆盖水平的联合依赖性。

Method: 使用通过SGD训练的保形化分位数和中位数回归方法，在数据分布的温和假设下，建立了预测集长度与理想区间长度偏差的非渐近界。

Result: 获得了阶数为O(1/√n + 1/(α²n) + 1/√m + exp(-α²m))的边界，捕捉了效率对训练集大小n、校准集大小m和误覆盖水平α的联合依赖性，识别了不同α区域下的收敛速率相变。

Conclusion: 研究结果为分配数据以控制预测集超额长度提供了指导，实证结果与理论发现一致，揭示了保形预测效率在不同参数区域的行为特征。

Abstract: Conformal prediction provides prediction sets with coverage guarantees. The
informativeness of conformal prediction depends on its efficiency, typically
quantified by the expected size of the prediction set. Prior work on the
efficiency of conformalized regression commonly treats the miscoverage level
$\alpha$ as a fixed constant. In this work, we establish non-asymptotic bounds
on the deviation of the prediction set length from the oracle interval length
for conformalized quantile and median regression trained via SGD, under mild
assumptions on the data distribution. Our bounds of order
$\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{n} + 1/(\alpha^2 n) + 1/\sqrt{m} + \exp(-\alpha^2 m))$
capture the joint dependence of efficiency on the proper training set size $n$,
the calibration set size $m$, and the miscoverage level $\alpha$. The results
identify phase transitions in convergence rates across different regimes of
$\alpha$, offering guidance for allocating data to control excess prediction
set length. Empirical results are consistent with our theoretical findings.

*Mariona Jaramillo-Civill,Peng Wu,Pau Closas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出DPMM-CFL算法，使用狄利克雷过程先验来自动推断聚类数量和客户端分配，解决传统聚类联邦学习中需要预先指定聚类数量的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类联邦学习方法需要预先固定聚类数量K，这在实际应用中不切实际，因为潜在的聚类结构通常是未知的。

Method: 在聚类参数分布上放置狄利克雷过程先验，通过非参数贝叶斯推断联合推断聚类数量和客户端分配，同时优化每个聚类的联邦学习目标。

Result: 在Dirichlet和类分割非IID分区下的基准数据集上验证了算法的有效性。

Conclusion: DPMM-CFL能够自动确定聚类数量，在每轮中耦合联邦更新和聚类推断，有效处理客户端异质性。

Abstract: Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) improves performance under non-IID client
heterogeneity by clustering clients and training one model per cluster, thereby
balancing between a global model and fully personalized models. However, most
CFL methods require the number of clusters K to be fixed a priori, which is
impractical when the latent structure is unknown. We propose DPMM-CFL, a CFL
algorithm that places a Dirichlet Process (DP) prior over the distribution of
cluster parameters. This enables nonparametric Bayesian inference to jointly
infer both the number of clusters and client assignments, while optimizing
per-cluster federated objectives. This results in a method where, at each
round, federated updates and cluster inferences are coupled, as presented in
this paper. The algorithm is validated on benchmark datasets under Dirichlet
and class-split non-IID partitions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bridged Clustering是一个半监督学习框架，通过独立聚类输入X和输出Y，然后使用少量配对样本学习稀疏可解释的桥梁，实现从非配对数据中学习预测器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统半监督学习未充分利用输出数据，而基于密集传输的方法缺乏可解释性。该方法旨在利用输出数据同时保持稀疏可解释的对齐。

Method: 首先独立聚类输入和输出数据集，然后使用少量配对样本学习输入簇和输出簇之间的稀疏桥梁。推理时，新输入被分配到最近的输入簇，返回链接的输出簇质心作为预测。

Result: 理论分析表明在有限误聚类和误桥接率下，该算法成为有效高效的预测器。实证结果与SOTA方法竞争，同时保持简单、模型无关和高标签效率。

Conclusion: Bridged Clustering在低监督设置下提供了一种简单、模型无关且标签高效的方法，能够利用输出数据并保持可解释性。

Abstract: We introduce Bridged Clustering, a semi-supervised framework to learn
predictors from any unpaired input $X$ and output $Y$ dataset. Our method first
clusters $X$ and $Y$ independently, then learns a sparse, interpretable bridge
between clusters using only a few paired examples. At inference, a new input
$x$ is assigned to its nearest input cluster, and the centroid of the linked
output cluster is returned as the prediction $\hat{y}$. Unlike traditional SSL,
Bridged Clustering explicitly leverages output-only data, and unlike dense
transport-based methods, it maintains a sparse and interpretable alignment.
Through theoretical analysis, we show that with bounded mis-clustering and
mis-bridging rates, our algorithm becomes an effective and efficient predictor.
Empirically, our method is competitive with SOTA methods while remaining
simple, model-agnostic, and highly label-efficient in low-supervision settings.

TL;DR: 研究表明，大型语言模型的投毒攻击只需要恒定数量的恶意文档，而不随数据集规模增大而增加，这对大型模型构成严重安全威胁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究假设攻击者控制训练语料库的一定比例，但对大型模型而言，即使很小比例也意味着不切实际的大量数据。本文旨在证明投毒攻击实际上只需要恒定数量的文档。

Method: 进行了迄今为止最大的预训练投毒实验，训练了从6亿到130亿参数的模型，使用Chinchilla最优数据集（60亿到2600亿tokens）。同时进行了小规模实验来研究影响攻击成功的因素。

Result: 发现250个投毒文档在所有模型和数据规模下都能同样地危害模型，即使最大模型训练了超过20倍的干净数据。在微调过程中也观察到相同的动态。

Conclusion: 通过数据投毒注入后门对大型模型来说可能比之前认为的更容易，因为所需的投毒数量不随模型规模扩大而增加，这凸显了需要更多防御研究来减轻未来模型的风险。

Abstract: Poisoning attacks can compromise the safety of large language models (LLMs)
by injecting malicious documents into their training data. Existing work has
studied pretraining poisoning assuming adversaries control a percentage of the
training corpus. However, for large models, even small percentages translate to
impractically large amounts of data. This work demonstrates for the first time
that poisoning attacks instead require a near-constant number of documents
regardless of dataset size. We conduct the largest pretraining poisoning
experiments to date, pretraining models from 600M to 13B parameters on
chinchilla-optimal datasets (6B to 260B tokens). We find that 250 poisoned
documents similarly compromise models across all model and dataset sizes,
despite the largest models training on more than 20 times more clean data. We
also run smaller-scale experiments to ablate factors that could influence
attack success, including broader ratios of poisoned to clean data and
non-random distributions of poisoned samples. Finally, we demonstrate the same
dynamics for poisoning during fine-tuning. Altogether, our results suggest that
injecting backdoors through data poisoning may be easier for large models than
previously believed as the number of poisons required does not scale up with
model size, highlighting the need for more research on defences to mitigate
this risk in future models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在宽度w=n和w=n+1时神经网络对Hanin-Sellke反例函数的逼近能力，分析了深度变化对逼近质量的影响以及神经元死亡现象的作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hanin和Sellke在2017年证明了当且仅当w>n时，ReLU激活的前馈神经网络才能在紧集上一致逼近连续函数。本文旨在研究在临界宽度w=n和w=n+1时，神经网络对该反例函数的实际逼近能力。

Method: 作者通过实验方法，在宽度w=n和w=n+1的情况下，尝试用不同深度的神经网络来逼近Hanin-Sellke反例函数，并观察逼近质量随深度变化的行为。

Result: 研究发现，在宽度w=n和w=n+1时，神经网络确实能够在一定程度上逼近反例函数，但逼近质量受到深度变化的影响，并且存在神经元死亡现象影响逼近效果。

Conclusion: 即使在临界宽度w=n和w=n+1时，神经网络仍具有一定的函数逼近能力，但深度变化和神经元死亡现象会显著影响逼近质量，这为理解神经网络表达能力提供了新的见解。

Abstract: In 2017, Hanin and Sellke showed that the class of arbitrarily deep,
real-valued, feed-forward and ReLU-activated networks of width w forms a dense
subset of the space of continuous functions on R^n, with respect to the
topology of uniform convergence on compact sets, if and only if w>n holds. To
show the necessity, a concrete counterexample function f:R^n->R was used. In
this note we actually approximate this very f by neural networks in the two
cases w=n and w=n+1 around the aforementioned threshold. We study how the
approximation quality behaves if we vary the depth and what effect (spoiler
alert: dying neurons) cause that behavior.

TL;DR: 该论文为软路由MoE模型提供了收敛性保证，证明了在适度过参数化下，学生网络能通过特征学习阶段恢复教师网络参数，并展示了训练后剪枝和微调的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管MoE架构在现代AI系统中广泛应用，但对其训练动态的理论理解仍局限于分离的专家-路由器优化或特定路由场景。本文旨在推进MoE理论，为联合训练提供收敛性保证。

Method: 采用学生-教师框架，分析软路由MoE模型与非线性的路由器和专家的联合训练过程，证明在适度过参数化下的收敛性，并引入训练后剪枝和微调策略。

Result: 证明了学生网络能通过特征学习阶段恢复教师网络参数，训练后剪枝能有效消除冗余神经元，微调过程能收敛到全局最优。

Conclusion: 该分析首次为理解MoE架构的优化景观提供了新见解，为软路由MoE模型的联合训练和优化提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a cornerstone of
modern AI systems. In particular, MoEs route inputs dynamically to specialized
experts whose outputs are aggregated through weighted summation. Despite their
widespread application, theoretical understanding of MoE training dynamics
remains limited to either separate expert-router optimization or only top-1
routing scenarios with carefully constructed datasets. This paper advances MoE
theory by providing convergence guarantees for joint training of soft-routed
MoE models with non-linear routers and experts in a student-teacher framework.
We prove that, with moderate over-parameterization, the student network
undergoes a feature learning phase, where the router's learning process is
``guided'' by the experts, that recovers the teacher's parameters. Moreover, we
show that a post-training pruning can effectively eliminate redundant neurons,
followed by a provably convergent fine-tuning process that reaches global
optimality. To our knowledge, our analysis is the first to bring novel insights
in understanding the optimization landscape of the MoE architecture.

TL;DR: 本文揭示了Thompson Sampling作为在线优化算法的本质，通过引入"忠实"平稳化方法将动态优化问题转换为平稳目标，从而解释其如何平衡探索与利用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thompson Sampling被广泛使用但机制不明确，其如何"正确"平衡探索与利用仍是个谜，需要从新的理论角度来理解其工作原理。

Method: 引入"忠实"平稳化方法将有限时域动态优化问题转换为平稳目标，使用Bellman原理研究时间不变最优策略，将Thompson Sampling重新表述为在线优化形式。

Result: 发现Thompson Sampling具有简单的在线优化形式，模仿Bellman最优策略结构，其中贪婪性通过基于点二列相关性的剩余不确定性度量进行正则化。

Conclusion: 这解决了Thompson Sampling如何平衡探索与利用的问题，并为研究和改进Thompson原始思想提供了原则性框架。

Abstract: Thompson Sampling is one of the most widely used and studied bandit
algorithms, known for its simple structure, low regret performance, and solid
theoretical guarantees. Yet, in stark contrast to most other families of bandit
algorithms, the exact mechanism through which posterior sampling (as introduced
by Thompson) is able to "properly" balance exploration and exploitation,
remains a mystery. In this paper we show that the core insight to address this
question stems from recasting Thompson Sampling as an online optimization
algorithm. To distill this, a key conceptual tool is introduced, which we refer
to as "faithful" stationarization of the regret formulation. Essentially, the
finite horizon dynamic optimization problem is converted into a stationary
counterpart which "closely resembles" the original objective (in contrast, the
classical infinite horizon discounted formulation, that leads to the Gittins
index, alters the problem and objective in too significant a manner). The newly
crafted time invariant objective can be studied using Bellman's principle which
leads to a time invariant optimal policy. When viewed through this lens,
Thompson Sampling admits a simple online optimization form that mimics the
structure of the Bellman-optimal policy, and where greediness is regularized by
a measure of residual uncertainty based on point-biserial correlation. This
answers the question of how Thompson Sampling balances
exploration-exploitation, and moreover, provides a principled framework to
study and further improve Thompson's original idea.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究DFF学习协议的理论特性，填补该协议在一般框架下系统研究的空白，并与监督学习和在线学习等经典协议进行对比。

Method: 使用新的维度概念来刻画可实现设置下的错误界限，在不可实现设置下提供错误上界并证明其一般不可改进性。

Result: 发现DFF中可实现维度不足以刻画最优不可实现错误界限或无遗憾算法的存在性，这与在线学习不同。

Conclusion: DFF学习协议在理论特性上与传统在线学习存在显著差异，特别是可实现维度在DFF中的作用有限，需要新的理论框架来理解这类具有丰富反馈的学习协议。

Abstract: We study the theoretical properties of the interactive learning protocol
Discriminative Feature Feedback (DFF) (Dasgupta et al., 2018). The DFF learning
protocol uses feedback in the form of discriminative feature explanations. We
provide the first systematic study of DFF in a general framework that is
comparable to that of classical protocols such as supervised learning and
online learning. We study the optimal mistake bound of DFF in the realizable
and the non-realizable settings, and obtain novel structural results, as well
as insights into the differences between Online Learning and settings with
richer feedback such as DFF. We characterize the mistake bound in the
realizable setting using a new notion of dimension. In the non-realizable
setting, we provide a mistake upper bound and show that it cannot be improved
in general. Our results show that unlike Online Learning, in DFF the realizable
dimension is insufficient to characterize the optimal non-realizable mistake
bound or the existence of no-regret algorithms.

TL;DR: TTGS是一种轻量级规划方法，通过构建数据集状态图并搜索子目标序列来提升离线目标条件强化学习的性能，无需训练修改或额外监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线目标条件强化学习在长时决策中面临时间信用分配和误差累积问题，离线设置会放大这些效应，需要解决方案。

Method: TTGS接受任意状态空间距离或成本信号，构建数据集状态加权图，执行快速搜索来组装子目标序列，由冻结策略执行。

Result: 在OGBench基准测试中，TTGS显著提高了多个基础学习器在挑战性运动任务上的成功率。

Conclusion: 简单的度量引导测试时规划对离线GCRL具有显著益处。

Abstract: Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) trains policies that
reach user-specified goals at test time, providing a simple, unsupervised,
domain-agnostic way to extract diverse behaviors from unlabeled, reward-free
datasets. Nonetheless, long-horizon decision making remains difficult for GCRL
agents due to temporal credit assignment and error accumulation, and the
offline setting amplifies these effects. To alleviate this issue, we introduce
Test-Time Graph Search (TTGS), a lightweight planning approach to solve the
GCRL task. TTGS accepts any state-space distance or cost signal, builds a
weighted graph over dataset states, and performs fast search to assemble a
sequence of subgoals that a frozen policy executes. When the base learner is
value-based, the distance is derived directly from the learned goal-conditioned
value function, so no handcrafted metric is needed. TTGS requires no changes to
training, no additional supervision, no online interaction, and no privileged
information, and it runs entirely at inference. On the OGBench benchmark, TTGS
improves success rates of multiple base learners on challenging locomotion
tasks, demonstrating the benefit of simple metric-guided test-time planning for
offline GCRL.

Abstract: The escalating complexity of network threats and the inherent class imbalance
in traffic data present formidable challenges for modern Intrusion Detection
Systems (IDS). While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in modeling topological
structures and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) are proficient in
capturing time-series dependencies, a framework that synergistically integrates
both while explicitly addressing data imbalance remains an open challenge. This
paper introduces a novel deep learning framework, named Gated Temporal
Convolutional Network and Graph (GTCN-G), engineered to overcome these
limitations. Our model uniquely fuses a Gated TCN (G-TCN) for extracting
hierarchical temporal features from network flows with a Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN) designed to learn from the underlying graph structure. The core
innovation lies in the integration of a residual learning mechanism,
implemented via a Graph Attention Network (GAT). This mechanism preserves
original feature information through residual connections, which is critical
for mitigating the class imbalance problem and enhancing detection sensitivity
for rare malicious activities (minority classes). We conducted extensive
experiments on two public benchmark datasets, UNSW-NB15 and ToN-IoT, to
validate our approach. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed
GTCN-G model achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming
existing baseline models in both binary and multi-class classification tasks.

Motivation: 蛋白质语言模型在零样本适应性预测方面表现出色，但需要大量训练数据。本文旨在通过将自然进化解释为隐式奖励最大化、MLM作为逆强化学习，开发更高效的适应性预测方法。

Method: 提出EvoIF模型，整合两个互补的进化信号：(i)从同源序列检索的家族内进化谱，(ii)从逆折叠logits提取的跨家族结构-进化约束，通过紧凑转换块融合序列-结构表示。

Result: 在ProteinGym基准测试（217个突变实验，>250万个突变体）中，EvoIF及其MSA增强变体达到最先进或竞争性性能，仅使用0.15%训练数据和更少参数。消融实验证实家族内和跨家族谱具有互补性。

Conclusion: EvoIF通过整合互补的进化信号，在保持高性能的同时显著减少数据需求和模型复杂度，为蛋白质工程提供高效适应性预测工具。

Abstract: Predicting the fitness impact of mutations is central to protein engineering
but constrained by limited assays relative to the size of sequence space.
Protein language models (pLMs) trained with masked language modeling (MLM)
exhibit strong zero-shot fitness prediction; we provide a unifying view by
interpreting natural evolution as implicit reward maximization and MLM as
inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), in which extant sequences act as expert
demonstrations and pLM log-odds serve as fitness estimates. Building on this
perspective, we introduce EvoIF, a lightweight model that integrates two
complementary sources of evolutionary signal: (i) within-family profiles from
retrieved homologs and (ii) cross-family structural-evolutionary constraints
distilled from inverse folding logits. EvoIF fuses sequence-structure
representations with these profiles via a compact transition block, yielding
calibrated probabilities for log-odds scoring. On ProteinGym (217 mutational
assays; >2.5M mutants), EvoIF and its MSA-enabled variant achieve
state-of-the-art or competitive performance while using only 0.15% of the
training data and fewer parameters than recent large models. Ablations confirm
that within-family and cross-family profiles are complementary, improving
robustness across function types, MSA depths, taxa, and mutation depths. The
codes will be made publicly available at https://github.com/aim-uofa/EvoIF.

Motivation: 现有的预训练2D图编码器忽略了与亚分子实例相关的丰富分子领域知识，而专门的分子预训练方法又缺乏整合多样化知识的灵活性。

Method: 提出分子对齐策略弥合预训练拓扑表示与领域知识表示之间的差距，并引入条件适配机制生成实例特定token实现细粒度知识整合。

Result: 在11个公共数据集上的广泛实验证明了MolGA的有效性。

Conclusion: MolGA提供了一种实用的方法，能够重用广泛可用的预训练2D编码器，同时在下游适配中灵活整合分子领域知识。

Abstract: Molecular graph representation learning is widely used in chemical and
biomedical research. While pre-trained 2D graph encoders have demonstrated
strong performance, they overlook the rich molecular domain knowledge
associated with submolecular instances (atoms and bonds). While molecular
pre-training approaches incorporate such knowledge into their pre-training
objectives, they typically employ designs tailored to a specific type of
knowledge, lacking the flexibility to integrate diverse knowledge present in
molecules. Hence, reusing widely available and well-validated pre-trained 2D
encoders, while incorporating molecular domain knowledge during downstream
adaptation, offers a more practical alternative. In this work, we propose
MolGA, which adapts pre-trained 2D graph encoders to downstream molecular
applications by flexibly incorporating diverse molecular domain knowledge.
First, we propose a molecular alignment strategy that bridge the gap between
pre-trained topological representations with domain-knowledge representations.
Second, we introduce a conditional adaptation mechanism that generates
instance-specific tokens to enable fine-grained integration of molecular domain
knowledge for downstream tasks. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on
eleven public datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of MolGA.

Abstract: While Language Models (LMs) have made significant progress in automating

low scalability and limited applicability because they rely on static, manually
curated tasks, demanding extensive time and manual effort to produce. We
introduce MLE-Smith, a fully automated multi-agent pipeline, to transform raw
datasets into competition-style MLE challenges through an efficient
generate-verify-execute paradigm for scaling MLE tasks with verifiable quality,
real-world usability, and rich diversity. The proposed multi-agent pipeline in
MLE-Smith drives structured task design and standardized refactoring, coupled
with a hybrid verification mechanism that enforces strict structural rules and
high-level semantic soundness. It further validates empirical solvability and
real-world fidelity through interactive execution. We apply MLE-Smith to 224 of
real-world datasets and generate 606 tasks spanning multiple categories,
objectives, and modalities, demonstrating that MLE-Smith can work effectively
across a wide range of real-world datasets. Evaluation on the generated tasks
shows that the performance of eight mainstream and cutting-edge LLMs on
MLE-Smith tasks is strongly correlated with their performance on carefully
human-designed tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of the MLE-Smith to
scaling up MLE tasks, while maintaining task quality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种利用现有短时域数据合成复杂多步推理问题的方法，通过课程学习和结果奖励来提升大语言模型的长时域推理能力，无需密集监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在短时域推理任务上表现良好，但在长时域推理时性能下降。现有方法依赖推理时支架或昂贵的步骤级监督，难以扩展。

Method: 将简单问题合成复杂多步依赖链，使用结果奖励进行课程学习，自动增加复杂度，避免训练饱和。

Result: 在GSM8K数据上训练后，在GSM-Symbolic、MATH-500、AIME等竞赛级基准上的准确率提升高达2.06倍，且在高pass@k下仍优于基线。

Conclusion: 该方法为仅使用现有数据扩展强化学习解决长时域问题提供了高效路径，理论上证明课程强化学习比全时域训练在样本复杂度上有指数级改进。

Abstract: Large language models excel at short-horizon reasoning tasks, but performance
drops as reasoning horizon lengths increase. Existing approaches to combat this
rely on inference-time scaffolding or costly step-level supervision, neither of
which scales easily. In this work, we introduce a scalable method to bootstrap
long-horizon reasoning capabilities using only existing, abundant short-horizon
data. Our approach synthetically composes simple problems into complex,
multi-step dependency chains of arbitrary length. We train models on this data
using outcome-only rewards under a curriculum that automatically increases in
complexity, allowing RL training to be scaled much further without saturating.
Empirically, our method generalizes remarkably well: curriculum training on
composed 6th-grade level math problems (GSM8K) boosts accuracy on longer,
competition-level benchmarks (GSM-Symbolic, MATH-500, AIME) by up to 2.06x.
Importantly, our long-horizon improvements are significantly higher than
baselines even at high pass@k, showing that models can learn new reasoning
paths under RL. Theoretically, we show that curriculum RL with outcome rewards
achieves an exponential improvement in sample complexity over full-horizon
training, providing training signal comparable to dense supervision. h1
therefore introduces an efficient path towards scaling RL for long-horizon
problems using only existing data.

TL;DR: 比较Birkhoff正规形式和共振正规形式在圆形限制性三体问题中表示中心流形轨迹的优劣，并基于此提出一种类似Floquet模式的站保持方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 正规形式为圆形限制性三体问题中的许多感兴趣轨迹提供了有用的近似，需要系统比较不同正规形式在表示中心流形轨迹方面的优势。

Method: 引入类似Floquet模式的站保持方法，通过脉冲机动在轨迹特定点最小化不稳定分量，提出了三种不同表述来覆盖Lyapunov、垂直、晕轨道以及Lissajous和准晕轨迹。

Result: 开发了能够统一处理多种轨道类型的站保持方法，包括Lyapunov轨道、垂直轨道、晕轨道、Lissajous轨迹和准晕轨迹。

Conclusion: Birkhoff正规形式和共振正规形式各有优势，基于正规形式开发的站保持方法能够有效控制多种类型的中心流形轨迹。

Abstract: The normal forms provide useful approximations for many trajectories of
interest within the circular restricted three-body problem. This paper aims to
thoroughly compare two of these forms: the Birkhoff normal form and the
resonant normal form, highlighting the strengths of each for the representation
of center manifold trajectories. A method of station-keeping is introduced,
analogous to Floquet modes, in which the unstable component is minimized at
specific points along a trajectory through impulsive maneuvers. Three different
formulations of the same station-keeping approach are posed, collectively
spanning Lyapunov, vertical, and halo orbits, as well as Lissajous and
quasihalo trajectories.

*Praveen Kumar Ranjan,Abhinav Sinha,Yongcan Cao*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出了一种非线性集成制导与控制方法，用于固定翼无人机的柔性编队飞行，考虑了高保真气动力学和推力动力学，使跟随者能够在领导者后方半球形区域内保持编队。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统领导者-跟随者方案固定跟随者相对于领导者的位置，限制了编队的灵活性。本文旨在开发一种柔性编队方案，使跟随者能够根据领导者机动动态调整位置，同时仅依赖相对信息和机载传感器。

Method: 使用基于动态表面控制的backstepping方法，将领导者-跟随者相对距离动力学映射到油门指令，将速度方向相对于视线的角度映射到气动控制面偏转。引入Lyapunov屏障函数确保方位角约束。

Result: 严格的稳定性分析保证了所有误差状态的均匀最终有界性，并在存在气动非线性的情况下严格满足约束条件。仿真结果验证了方法的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 所提出的IGC方法实现了柔性编队飞行，允许跟随者与领导者存在方向失配，在领导者激进机动时能够在允许的编队集合内转换相对位置，适用于GPS拒止或非合作场景。

Abstract: This paper presents a nonlinear integrated guidance and control (IGC)
approach for flexible leader-follower formation flight of fixed-wing unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs) while accounting for high-fidelity aerodynamics and
thrust dynamics. Unlike conventional leader-follower schemes that fix the
follower's position relative to the leader, the follower is steered to maintain
range and bearing angles (which is the angle between its velocity vector and
its line-of-sight (LOS) with respect to the leader) arbitrarily close to the
prescribed values, enabling the follower to maintain formation on a
hemispherical region behind the leader. The proposed IGC framework directly
maps leader-follower relative range dynamics to throttle commands, and the
follower's velocity orientation relative to the LOS to aerodynamic control
surface deflections. This enables synergism between guidance and control
subsystems. The control design uses a dynamic surface control-based
backstepping approach to achieve convergence to the desired formation set,
where Lyapunov barrier functions are incorporated to ensure the follower's
bearing angle is constrained within specified bounds. Rigorous stability
analysis guarantees uniform ultimate boundedness of all error states and strict
constraint satisfaction in the presence of aerodynamic nonlinearities. The
proposed flexible formation scheme allows the follower to have an orientation
mismatch relative to the leader to execute anticipatory reconfiguration by
transitioning between the relative positions in the admissible formation set
when the leader aggressively maneuvers. The proposed IGC law relies only on
relative information and onboard sensors without the information about the
leader's maneuver, making it suitable for GPS-denied or non-cooperative
scenarios. Finally, we present simulation results to vindicate the
effectiveness and robustness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标是辅助惯性导航系统，探索生成有效的测量创新误差的方法来进行非线性状态估计，提高导航精度。

Method: 比较了两种点云测量模型：1）基于光线投射的模型，从给定姿态返回预测的点云测量；2）滑动网格模型，不需要光线投射，计算量更小，需要点云测量模式本身并返回预测的点云测量。还分析了两种模型的高度可观测性特性。

Result: 点云测量在性能上优于雷达高度计，能够提供更高的精度。两种点云测量模型的选择取决于计算资源。

Conclusion: 点云测量比雷达高度计表现更好，具体使用哪种点云测量模型取决于可用的计算资源。

Abstract: We investigate the use of a point cloud measurement in terrain-aided
navigation. Our goal is to aid an inertial navigation system, by exploring ways
to generate a useful measurement innovation error for effective nonlinear state
estimation. We compare two such measurement models that involve the scanning of
a digital terrain elevation model: a) one that is based on typical ray-casting
from a given pose, that returns the predicted point cloud measurement from that
pose, and b) another computationally less intensive one that does not require
raycasting and we refer to herein as a sliding grid. Besides requiring a pose,
it requires the pattern of the point cloud measurement itself and returns a
predicted point cloud measurement. We further investigate the observability
properties of the altitude for both measurement models. As a baseline, we
compare the use of a point cloud measurement performance to the use of a radar
altimeter and show the gains in accuracy. We conclude by showing that a point
cloud measurement outperforms the use of a radar altimeter, and the point cloud
measurement model to use depends on the computational resources

Method: 采用基于GPU的蒙特卡洛采样方法在线高效逼近最优控制，MPPI能够轻松处理不可微成本函数，便于整合复杂制造过程中的性能标准。

Result: 案例研究表明，MPPI在张力调节性能上显著优于传统模型预测控制（MPC）。

Conclusion: MPPI方法适用于先进制造中的实时控制，为卷对卷制造系统提供了有效的控制解决方案。

Abstract: Roll-to-roll (R2R) manufacturing is a continuous processing technology
essential for scalable production of thin-film materials and printed
electronics, but precise control remains challenging due to subsystem
interactions, nonlinearities, and process disturbances. This paper proposes a
Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control formulation for R2R systems,
leveraging a GPU-based Monte-Carlo sampling approach to efficiently approximate
optimal controls online. Crucially, MPPI easily handles non-differentiable cost
functions, enabling the incorporation of complex performance criteria relevant
to advanced manufacturing processes. A case study is presented that
demonstrates that MPPI significantly improves tension regulation performance
compared to conventional model predictive control (MPC), highlighting its
suitability for real-time control in advanced manufacturing.

TL;DR: 提出了一种θ对称SRG方法，用于分析级联系统的反馈互联稳定性，相比传统图分离方法能处理循环互联问题，提供更不保守的结果。

Motivation: 传统图分离方法无法处理循环互联问题，需要一种能更好捕捉系统特性并提供更精确稳定性分析的工具。

Method: 利用θ对称SRG的次乘性特性，结合增益和相位信息，为系统提供统一的图形化表征。

Result: θ对称SRG能有效处理循环互联问题，在标量情况下可精确简化为标量本身，比标准SRG更适合作为经典奈奎斯特图的多输入多输出扩展。

Conclusion: θ对称SRG是一种有效的图形化稳定性分析工具，特别适用于传统方法无法处理的循环互联系统。

Abstract: In this paper, we utilize a variant of the scaled relative graph (SRG),
referred to as the $\theta$-symmetric SRG, to develop a graphical stability
criterion for the feedback interconnection of a cascade of systems. A crucial
submultiplicative property of $\theta$-symmetric SRG is established, enabling
it to handle cyclic interconnections for which conventional graph separation
methods are not applicable. By integrating both gain and refined phase
information, the $\theta$-symmetric SRG provides a unified graphical
characterization of the system, which better captures system properties and
yields less conservative results. In the scalar case, the $\theta$-symmetric
SRG can be reduced exactly to the scalar itself, whereas the standard SRG
appears to be a conjugate pair. Consequently, the frequency-wise
$\theta$-symmetric SRG is more suitable than the standard SRG as a multi-input
multi-output extension of the classical Nyquist plot. Illustrative examples are
included to demonstrate the effectiveness of the $\theta$-symmetric SRG.

Method: 使用局部扇区边界建模神经网络控制器，利用正性结构推导线性、延迟无关的认证证书，并与最先进的IQC神经网络验证流程进行性能对比。

Result: 在代表性案例中，基于正性的测试比基于SDP的IQC快几个数量级，同时能够认证后者无法覆盖的机制。

Conclusion: 该方法为风险感知控制提供了可扩展的安全保证，在保证认证能力的同时显著提高了计算效率。

Abstract: We present a risk-aware safety certification method for autonomous, learning
enabled control systems. Focusing on two realistic risks, state/input delays

delay-independent certificates that guarantee local exponential stability
across admissible uncertainties. To benchmark performance, we adopt and
implement a state-of-the-art IQC NN verification pipeline. On representative
cases, our positivity-based tests run orders of magnitude faster than SDP-based
IQC while certifying regimes the latter cannot-providing scalable safety
guarantees that complement risk-aware control.

TL;DR: 提出基于"辅助点"的弹性控制算法，解决多智能体系统在存在智能体攻击和DoS攻击下的多维共识和分布式优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统面临智能体攻击（恶意、拜占庭、顽固智能体）和DoS攻击的双重威胁，导致网络拓扑时变甚至断开，需要确保良性智能体达成共识。

Method: 每个健康智能体利用邻居状态构建"安全核"，并在每次迭代中向该核内的特定点更新状态；当DoS攻击阻断通信时，使用攻击前最后接收的状态。

Result: 理论证明和数值示例验证了所提算法的有效性，能够在双重攻击下实现良性智能体的共识。

Conclusion: 提出的弹性控制算法和RMDO算法能够有效应对智能体攻击和DoS攻击，确保多智能体系统的安全运行。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the resilient multi-dimensional consensus and
distributed optimization problems of multi-agent systems (MASs) in the presence
of both agent-based and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The considered
agent-based attacks can cover malicious, Byzantine, and stubborn agents. The
links between agents in the network can be blocked by DoS attacks, which may
lead the digraph to be time-varying and even disconnected. The objective is to
ensure that the remaining benign agents achieve consensus. To this end, an
"auxiliary point"-based resilient control algorithm is proposed for MASs. Under
the proposed algorithm, each healthy agent constructs a "safe kernel" utilizing
the states of its in-neighbors and updates its state toward a specific point
within this kernel at each iteration. If an agent cannot receive its neighbors'
states owing to DoS attacks, it will use the states received immediately before
the DoS period. Moreover, a resilient multi-dimensional distributed
optimization (RMDO) algorithm is also proposed. Theoretical proofs and
numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed algorithms.

Motivation: 解决多智能体航天拦截场景中的碰撞避免问题，需要在保证安全的同时维持系统的可扩展性和计算效率。

Method: 采用鲁棒控制屏障函数(RCBFs)和局部二次规划(QP)，结合基于距离和零努力脱靶量(ZEM)的事件触发机制，引入松弛变量方案处理同时约束的可行性问题。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该框架在多对多拦截场景中能够保持无碰撞运行，且与名义制导的偏差最小，提供了计算高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Conclusion: 所提出的分散式安全滤波器为安全关键的多智能体航天系统提供了一种有效的碰撞避免方法，具有良好的可扩展性和计算效率。

Abstract: This paper presents a decentralized safety filter for collision avoidance in
multi-agent aerospace interception scenarios. The approach leverages robust
control barrier functions (RCBFs) to guarantee forward invariance of safety
sets under bounded inputs and high-relative-degree dynamics. Each effector
executes its nominal cooperative guidance command, while a local quadratic
program (QP) modifies the input only when necessary. Event-triggered activation
based on range and zero-effort miss (ZEM) criteria ensures scalability by
restricting active constraints to relevant neighbors. To resolve feasibility
issues from simultaneous constraints, a slack-variable relaxation scheme is
introduced that prioritizes critical agents in a Pareto-optimal manner.
Simulation results in many-on-many interception scenarios demonstrate that the
proposed framework maintains collision-free operation with minimal deviation
from nominal guidance, providing a computationally efficient and scalable
solution for safety-critical multi-agent aerospace systems.

Method: 使用信号时序逻辑规范表达海事交通规则，生成违反这些规则的对抗性训练场景，通过伪造驱动的方法改进强化学习训练。

Result: 在双船公海导航实验中，该方法提供了更相关的训练场景，实现了更一致的规则遵守。

Conclusion: 伪造驱动的强化学习方法能有效提高自主船舶对海事交通规则的遵守能力。

Abstract: Compliance with maritime traffic rules is essential for the safe operation of
autonomous vessels, yet training reinforcement learning (RL) agents to adhere
to them is challenging. The behavior of RL agents is shaped by the training
scenarios they encounter, but creating scenarios that capture the complexity of
maritime navigation is non-trivial, and real-world data alone is insufficient.
To address this, we propose a falsification-driven RL approach that generates
adversarial training scenarios in which the vessel under test violates maritime
traffic rules, which are expressed as signal temporal logic specifications. Our
experiments on open-sea navigation with two vessels demonstrate that the
proposed approach provides more relevant training scenarios and achieves more
consistent rule compliance.

Motivation: 解决再调度市场中灵活性服务提供商通过策略性调整基准来加剧拥堵和提高系统成本的问题

Method: 使用防御者-攻击者-防御者博弈模型，构建三层优化问题，并采用定制分支定界算法求解

Result: ACA方法可显著降低再调度成本（如25%），对FSP利润影响有限，算法在大多数场景下能高效求解

Conclusion: ACA方法的有效性取决于DSO调用频率和对FSP策略性投标行为的预测能力

Abstract: Redispatch markets are widely used by system operators to manage network
congestion. A well-known drawback, however, is that Flexibility Service
Providers (FSPs) may strategically adjust their baselines in anticipation of
redispatch actions, thereby aggravating congestion and raising system costs. To
address this increase-decrease gaming, Distribution System Operators (DSOs)
could use Alternative Connection Agreements (ACAs) to conditionally limit the
available connection capacity of market participants in the day-ahead stage. In
this paper, we present a novel Defender-Attacker-Defender game to investigate
the potential of this approach in distribution networks under load and price
uncertainty. We solve the resulting trilevel optimization model using a custom
branch-and-bound algorithm, and we demonstrate that it efficiently solves the
problem without exploring many nodes in the branch-and-bound search tree for
most simulated scenarios. The case study demonstrates that applying ACAs can
substantially lower redispatch costs (e.g. by 25%) for the DSO with only a
limited impact on FSP profits. The effectiveness of the approach critically
depends on how often the DSO can invoke ACAs and on the extent to which the DSO
can anticipate strategic bidding behavior of the FSP.

Abstract: Splitting a Bose--Einstein condensate (BEC) is a key operation in fundamental
physics experiments and emerging quantum technologies, where precise
preparation of well--defined initial states requires fast yet coherent control
of the condensate's nonlinear dynamics. This work formulates the BEC splitting
process as an optimal feedforward control problem based on a physically
interpretable, reduced--order model identified from limited experimental data.
We introduce a systematic calibration strategy that combines optimal experiment
selection and constrained nonlinear parameter estimation, enabling accurate
system identification with minimal experimental overhead. Using this calibrated
model, we compute energy--optimal trajectories via indirect optimal control to
realize shortcuts to adiabaticity (STAs), achieving rapid transitions to the
ground state of a double--well potential while suppressing excitations.
Experiments confirm that the proposed control framework yields high--fidelity
state transfers across multiple configurations, demonstrating its robustness
and scalability for quantum control applications.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法提供了一种计算高效的安全约束控制方案，通过变换方法实现了安全性和跟踪性能的统一保证。

Abstract: This paper presents a control law for stabilization and trajectory tracking
of a multicopter subject to safety constraints. The proposed approach
guarantees forward invariance of a prescribed safety set while ensuring smooth
tracking performance. Unlike conventional control barrier function methods, the
constrained control problem is transformed into an unconstrained one using
state-dependent mappings together with carefully constructed Lyapunov
functions. This approach enables explicit synthesis of the control law, instead
of requiring a solution of constrained optimization at each step. The
transformation also enables the controller to enforce safety without
sacrificing stability or performance. Simulation results for a polytopic
reference trajectory confined within a designated safe region demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: Automatic chord recognition (ACR) via deep learning models has gradually
achieved promising recognition accuracy, yet two key challenges remain. First,
prior work has primarily focused on audio-domain ACR, while symbolic music
(e.g., score) ACR has received limited attention due to data scarcity. Second,
existing methods still overlook strategies that are aligned with human music
analytical practices. To address these challenges, we make two contributions:
(1) we introduce POP909-CL, an enhanced version of POP909 dataset with
tempo-aligned content and human-corrected labels of chords, beats, keys, and
time signatures; and (2) We propose BACHI, a symbolic chord recognition model
that decomposes the task into different decision steps, namely boundary
detection and iterative ranking of chord root, quality, and bass (inversion).
This mechanism mirrors the human ear-training practices. Experiments
demonstrate that BACHI achieves state-of-the-art chord recognition performance
on both classical and pop music benchmarks, with ablation studies validating
the effectiveness of each module.

Abstract: As advances in synthetic voice generation accelerate, an increasing variety

indistinguishable from real human speech. This evolution poses new and serious
threats across sectors where audio recordings serve as critical evidence.
Although fake voice detectors are also advancing, the arms race between fake

this is the most comprehensive cross-domain assessment conducted to date. Our
study reveals substantial security vulnerabilities in current fake voice
detection systems, underscoring critical gaps in their real-world robustness.
To advance the field, we propose a unified and effective metric that
consolidates the diverse and often inconsistent evaluation criteria previously
used across different studies. This metric enables standardized,
straightforward comparisons of the robustness of fake voice detectors. We
conclude by offering actionable recommendations for building more resilient
fake voice detection technologies, with the broader goal of reinforcing the
foundations of AI security and trustworthiness.

### [235] [Pitch Estimation With Mean Averaging Smoothed Product Spectrum And Musical Consonance Evaluation Using MASP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06625)
*Murat Yasar Baskin*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 该研究提出了MASP频谱，这是谐波乘积谱的改进版本，旨在增强对谐波和非谐波情况下的音高估计。通过引入基于全局均值的频谱平滑，MASP算法减少了HPS对缺失分音频谱的不必要敏感性。该方法展示了与感知期望一致的稳健音高估计。基于协和度与周期性之间的强相关性，该算法被扩展用于评估双音和三音的协和度，产生与音乐理论和感知一致的协和度层次。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进谐波乘积谱(HPS)的音高估计性能，特别是对于算法上具有欺骗性但仍产生清晰音高的频谱，包括谐波和非谐波情况。同时基于协和度与周期性的强相关性，探索音高和协和度感知可能共享的底层机制。

Method: 提出了MASP（均值平均平滑乘积）频谱，通过引入基于全局均值的频谱平滑来减少HPS对缺失分音频谱的敏感性。扩展该算法并提出谐波性度量(H)来评估双音和三音的协和度。

Result: MASP算法展示了与感知期望一致的稳健音高估计。协和度评估产生了与音乐理论和感知实践一致的协和度层次结构。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明音高和协和度感知可能共享依赖于频谱的相似底层机制。MASP频谱在音高估计方面表现出色，且谐波性度量能够有效评估协和度。

Abstract: This study introduces Mean Averaging Smoothed Product (MASP) Spectrum, which
is a modified version of the Harmonic Product Spectrum, designed to enhance
pitch estimation for many algorithm-wise deceptive frequency spectra that still
lead clear pitches, for both harmonic and inharmonic cases. By introducing a
global mean based smoothing for spectrum, the MASP algorithm diminishes the
unwanted sensitivity of HPS for spectra with missing partials. The method
exhibited robust pitch estimations consistent with perceptual expectations.
Motivated upon the strong correlation between consonance and periodicity, the
same algorithm is extended and, with the proposition of a harmonicity measure
(H), used to evaluate musical consonance for two and three tones; yielding
consonance hierarchies that align with perception and practice of music theory.
These findings suggest that perception of pitch and consonance may share a
similar underlying mechanism that depend on spectrum.

*Phuong Tuan Dat,Tran Huy Dat*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出将XLSR-Conformer模型中的MLP替换为KAN网络，显著提升了合成语音检测性能，在ASVspoof2021数据集上相对改进60.55% EER。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音合成技术的进步导致更复杂的欺骗攻击，对自动说话人验证系统构成挑战。虽然基于自监督学习的系统在合成语音检测方面表现优异，但仍有架构改进空间。

Method: 将XLSR-Conformer模型中的传统多层感知机(MLP)替换为基于Kolmogorov-Arnold表示定理的KAN网络。

Result: 在ASVspoof2021数据集上，相对改进60.55%的等错误率(EER)，在21LA集上达到0.70% EER，且该替换方法对各种SSL架构都具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 将KAN整合到基于SSL的模型中，是推进合成语音检测技术发展的有前景方向。

Abstract: Recent advancements in speech synthesis technologies have led to increasingly
sophisticated spoofing attacks, posing significant challenges for automatic
speaker verification systems. While systems based on self-supervised learning
(SSL) models, particularly the XLSR-Conformer architecture, have demonstrated
remarkable performance in synthetic speech detection, there remains room for
architectural improvements. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that
replaces the traditional Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) in the XLSR-Conformer
model with a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), a powerful universal approximator
based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Our experimental results
on ASVspoof2021 demonstrate that the integration of KAN to XLSR-Conformer model
can improve the performance by 60.55% relatively in Equal Error Rate (EER) LA
and DF sets, further achieving 0.70% EER on the 21LA set. Besides, the proposed
replacement is also robust to various SSL architectures. These findings suggest
that incorporating KAN into SSL-based models is a promising direction for
advances in synthetic speech detection.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了AudioMarathon基准测试，用于评估大音频语言模型在长音频处理中的理解和推理效率，包含长上下文音频输入、全领域覆盖和复杂推理任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频基准测试大多基于短片段，无法评估模型在真实长上下文环境下的表现，且大音频语言模型面临注意力二次方成本和长程时间依赖建模的挑战。

Method: 构建包含三个支柱的多样化任务集：长上下文音频输入（90-300秒，对应2250-7500个音频token）、全领域覆盖（语音、声音、音乐）和需要多跳推理的复杂推理任务。

Result: 评估最先进的大音频语言模型发现，随着音频长度增加，性能明显下降；研究加速技术并分析token修剪和KV缓存淘汰的权衡，结果显示当前模型存在较大差距。

Conclusion: AudioMarathon将推动音频和多模态研究社区开发更先进的音频理解模型，需要更好的时间推理和内存效率架构。

Abstract: Processing long-form audio is a major challenge for Large Audio Language
models (LALMs). These models struggle with the quadratic cost of attention
($O(N^2)$) and with modeling long-range temporal dependencies. Existing audio
benchmarks are built mostly from short clips and do not evaluate models in
realistic long context settings. To address this gap, we introduce
AudioMarathon, a benchmark designed to evaluate both understanding and
inference efficiency on long-form audio. AudioMarathon provides a diverse set
of tasks built upon three pillars: long-context audio inputs with durations
ranging from 90.0 to 300.0 seconds, which correspond to encoded sequences of
2,250 to 7,500 audio tokens, respectively, full domain coverage across speech,
sound, and music, and complex reasoning that requires multi-hop inference. We
evaluate state-of-the-art LALMs and observe clear performance drops as audio
length grows. We also study acceleration techniques and analyze the trade-offs
of token pruning and KV cache eviction. The results show large gaps across
current LALMs and highlight the need for better temporal reasoning and
memory-efficient architectures. We believe AudioMarathon will drive the audio
and multimodal research community to develop more advanced audio understanding
models capable of solving complex audio tasks.

*Thomas Marshall Vielmetti,Devansh R. Agrawal,Dimitra Panagou*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: R3R是首个在距离通信约束下具有无限时间安全保证的去中心化异步多智能体运动规划框架，通过结合门卫安全框架和R-有界性几何约束，确保非线性智能体系统的形式化安全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的去中心化多智能体运动规划方法缺乏形式化的无限时间安全保证，特别是在通信受限系统中。需要一种能够在通信约束下提供可证明安全性的解决方案。

Method: 结合门卫安全框架和R-有界性几何约束，将轨迹限制在规划半径内（该半径是通信半径的函数），仅使用局部信息即可证明轨迹在所有时间都是安全的。算法完全异步，保证在时变网络中这些保证的前向不变性。

Result: 在多达128个Dubins车辆的仿真中验证了方法，在密集、障碍物丰富的场景中实现了100%的安全性。性能随智能体密度而非问题规模扩展。

Conclusion: R3R为可扩展且可证明安全的多智能体系统提供了实用解决方案，首次在通信约束下实现了去中心化异步运动规划的无限时间安全保证。

Abstract: Existing decentralized methods for multi-agent motion planning lack formal,
infinite-horizon safety guarantees, especially for communication-constrained
systems. We present R3R, to our knowledge the first decentralized and
asynchronous framework for multi-agent motion planning under distance-based
communication constraints with infinite-horizon safety guarantees for systems
of nonlinear agents. R3R's novelty lies in combining our gatekeeper safety
framework with a geometric constraint called R-Boundedness, which together
establish a formal link between an agent's communication radius and its ability
to plan safely. We constrain trajectories to within a fixed planning radius
that is a function of the agent's communication radius, which enables
trajectories to be shown provably safe for all time, using only local
information. Our algorithm is fully asynchronous, and ensures the forward
invariance of these guarantees even in time-varying networks where agents
asynchronously join, leave, and replan. We validate our approach in simulations
of up to 128 Dubins vehicles, demonstrating 100% safety in dense, obstacle rich
scenarios. Our results demonstrate that R3R's performance scales with agent
density rather than problem size, providing a practical solution for scalable
and provably safe multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在焦虑情境下会做出类似人类的非理性消费决策，导致购物篮营养质量下降


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs从文本生成器发展为自主代理，需要评估其在现实世界中的可靠性，特别是压力情境下的决策表现

Method: 让三个先进LLM模型在预算约束下执行杂货购物任务，比较暴露于焦虑诱导创伤叙事前后的决策变化

Result: 创伤提示持续降低了购物篮的营养质量，影响在所有模型和预算水平上都显著

Conclusion: 心理情境能系统性地改变LLMs的行为决策，揭示了新型漏洞，对数字健康、消费者安全和AI伦理部署有重要意义

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving from text generators to
autonomous agents, raising urgent questions about their reliability in
real-world contexts. Stress and anxiety are well known to bias human
decision-making, particularly in consumer choices. Here, we tested whether LLM
agents exhibit analogous vulnerabilities. Three advanced models (ChatGPT-5,
Gemini 2.5, Claude 3.5-Sonnet) performed a grocery shopping task under budget
constraints (24, 54, 108 USD), before and after exposure to anxiety-inducing
traumatic narratives. Across 2,250 runs, traumatic prompts consistently reduced
the nutritional quality of shopping baskets (Change in Basket Health Scores of
-0.081 to -0.126; all pFDR<0.001; Cohens d=-1.07 to -2.05), robust across
models and budgets. These results show that psychological context can
systematically alter not only what LLMs generate but also the actions they
perform. By reproducing human-like emotional biases in consumer behavior, LLM
agents reveal a new class of vulnerabilities with implications for digital
health, consumer safety, and ethical AI deployment.

*Hans G. W. van Dam*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于MCP协议的GUI语音交互架构，使传统GUI应用能够通过自然语言进行语音控制，同时评估了本地部署的开源LLM在语音多模态UI中的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数生产级应用在设计时未考虑语音交互，而现代LLM和语音识别技术使得通过自然语言控制GUI成为可能，需要解决GUI与语音助手的接口问题。

Method: 采用MVVM模式，通过ViewModel将应用的导航图和语义通过MCP协议暴露给助手，提供当前视图相关工具和全局工具，确保语音输入与视觉界面的可靠对齐。

Result: 该架构实现了完整的语音可访问性，同时评估发现近期较小的开源模型在整体准确性上接近领先的专有模型，但需要企业级硬件保证快速响应。

Conclusion: 该架构为应用提供了面向未来OS超级助手的语音交互能力，同时证明了本地部署开源LLM在语音多模态UI中的实用性，但需考虑硬件要求。

Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) and real-time speech recognition now
make it possible to issue any graphical user interface (GUI) action through
natural language and receive the corresponding system response directly through
the GUI. Most production applications were never designed with speech in mind.
This article provides a concrete architecture that enables GUIs to interface
with LLM-based speech-enabled assistants.
  The architecture makes an application's navigation graph and semantics
available through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The ViewModel, part of the
MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern, exposes the application's capabilities to
the assistant by supplying both tools applicable to a currently visible view
and application-global tools extracted from the GUI tree router. This
architecture facilitates full voice accessibility while ensuring reliable
alignment between spoken input and the visual interface, accompanied by
consistent feedback across modalities. It future-proofs apps for upcoming OS
super assistants that employ computer use agents (CUAs) and natively consume
MCP if an application provides it.
  To address concerns about privacy and data security, the practical
effectiveness of locally deployable, open-weight LLMs for speech-enabled
multimodal UIs is evaluated. Findings suggest that recent smaller open-weight
models approach the performance of leading proprietary models in overall
accuracy and require enterprise-grade hardware for fast responsiveness.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: With recent advancements in multi-agent generative AI (Gen AI), technology
organizations like Microsoft are adopting these complex tools, redefining AI
agents as active collaborators in complex workflows rather than as passive
tools. In this study, we investigated how early adopters and developers
conceptualize multi-agent Gen AI tools, focusing on how they understand
human-AI collaboration mechanisms, general collaboration dynamics, and
transparency in the context of AI tools. We conducted semi-structured
interviews with 13 developers, all early adopters of multi-agent Gen AI
technology who work at Microsoft. Our findings revealed that these early
adopters conceptualize multi-agent systems as "teams" of specialized role-based
and task-based agents, such as assistants or reviewers, structured similar to
human collaboration models and ranging from AI-dominant to AI-assisted,
user-controlled interactions. We identified key challenges, including error
propagation, unpredictable and unproductive agent loop behavior, and the need
for clear communication to mitigate the layered transparency issues. Early
adopters' perspectives about the role of transparency underscored its
importance as a way to build trust, verify and trace errors, and prevent
misuse, errors, and leaks. The insights and design considerations we present
contribute to CSCW research about collaborative mechanisms with capabilities
ranging from AI-dominant to AI-assisted interactions, transparency and
oversight strategies in human-agent and agent-agent interactions, and how
humans make sense of these multi-agent systems as dynamic, role-diverse
collaborators which are customizable for diverse needs and workflows. We
conclude with future research directions that extend CSCW approaches to the
design of inter-agent and human mediation interactions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在日常生活中的普及，需要帮助青少年发展批判性使用和评估AI系统的能力，并设想更好的替代方案。特别关注黑人穆斯林少女这一边缘化群体。

Method: 采用案例研究方法，设计了一个为期三天的非正式教育项目，让参与者使用生成式AI进行时尚设计创作，并通过讨论反思AI的社会伦理限制。

Result: 研究发现，女孩们在使用AI创作梦想时装系列时，遇到了AI模型的偏见和安全系统故障等问题，这些限制了她们表达创意、身体和文化的输出。讨论帮助参与者发展了批判性AI素养。

Conclusion: 将创造力和身份认同联系起来的计算教育体验设计可以支持批判性AI素养的发展，为边缘化群体提供身份肯定的技术体验。

Abstract: As AI increasingly saturates our daily lives, it is crucial that youth
develop skills to critically use and assess AI systems and envision better
alternatives. We apply theories from culturally responsive computing to design
and study a learning experience meant to support Black Muslim teen girls in
developing critical literacy with generative AI (GenAI). We investigate fashion
design as a culturally-rich, creative domain for youth to apply GenAI and then
reflect on GenAI's socio-ethical aspects in relation to their own
intersectional identities. Through a case study of a three-day, voluntary
informal education program, we show how fashion design with GenAI exposed
affordances and limitations of current GenAI tools. As the girls used GenAI to
create realistic depictions of their dream fashion collections, they
encountered socio-ethical limitations of AI, such as biased models and
malfunctioning safety systems that prohibited their generation of outputs that
reflected their creative ideas, bodies, and cultures. Discussions anchored in
the phenomenology of impossible creative realization supported participants'
development of critical AI literacy and descriptions of how preferable,
identity-affirming technologies would behave. Our findings contribute to the
field's growing understanding of how computing education experience designs
linking creativity and identity can support critical AI literacy development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言在LLM辅助编程中控制力有限，难以构建复杂软件系统，需要更高层次的抽象语言来增强开发者控制。

Method: 基于伪代码的Code Semantic Zooming方法，通过VS Code扩展实现多层级语义抽象，支持迭代式代码探索和精炼。

Result: 通过两个真实案例研究验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: Code Semantic Zooming为LLM辅助编程提供了有效的控制机制，提升了复杂软件系统的开发能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have introduced a new
paradigm for software development, where source code is generated directly from
natural language prompts. While this paradigm significantly boosts development
productivity, building complex, real-world software systems remains challenging
because natural language offers limited control over the generated code.
Inspired by the historical evolution of programming languages toward higher
levels of abstraction, we advocate for a high-level abstraction language that
gives developers greater control over LLM-assisted code writing. To this end,
we propose Code Semantic Zooming, a novel approach based on pseudocode that
allows developers to iteratively explore, understand, and refine code across
multiple layers of semantic abstraction. We implemented Code Semantic Zooming
as a VS Code extension and demonstrated its effectiveness through two
real-world case studies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在工作场所的普及，确保AI系统的可解释性和建立用户信任变得至关重要。目前AI界面在透明度和信任设计方面仍有不足，需要研究不同界面如何影响用户体验。

Method: 采用设计驱动方法开发了节点树界面，将AI生成响应可视化为层次化组织的交互节点。通过比较研究，让20名商业用户使用两种界面完成探索性、决策制定和问题解决任务。

Result: 定量和定性分析表明，节点树界面在头脑风暴、任务表现和决策支持方面优于聊天机器人界面，并能通过保持上下文提高用户信任度。聊天机器人界面更适合线性逐步查询。

Conclusion: 能够根据任务需求在结构化可视化和对话格式之间自适应切换的AI界面，可以显著增强AI系统的透明度和用户信心，这对企业应用中建立团队信任至关重要。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become ubiquitous in workplace tools and
decision-making processes, ensuring explainability and fostering user trust are
critical. Although advancements in LLM engineering continue, human-centered
design is still catching up, particularly when it comes to embedding
transparency and trust into AI interfaces. This study evaluates user
experiences with two distinct AI interfaces - node-tree interfaces and chatbot
interfaces - to assess their performance in exploratory, follow-up inquiry,
decision-making, and problem-solving tasks. Our design-driven approach
introduces a node-tree interface that visually structures AI-generated
responses into hierarchically organized, interactive nodes, allowing users to
navigate, refine, and follow up on complex information. In a comparative study
with n=20 business users, we observed that while the chatbot interface
effectively supports linear, step-by-step queries, it is the node-tree
interface that enhances brainstorming. Quantitative and qualitative findings
indicate that node-tree interfaces not only improve task performance and
decision-making support but also promote higher levels of user trust by
preserving context. Our findings suggest that adaptive AI interfaces capable of
switching between structured visualizations and conversational formats based on
task requirements can significantly enhance transparency and user confidence in
AI-powered systems. This work contributes actionable insights to the fields of
human-robot interaction and AI design, particularly for enterprise applications
where trust-building is critical for teams.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI驱动的道路监控系统日益普及，虽然能提升安全，但也引发隐私、公平性等担忧。目前关于公众如何看待AI增强的公共空间监控的实证研究还很有限。

Method: 采用3×3因子设计的在线调查（N=720），在中国、欧洲和美国三个地区比较三种监控模式：传统监控、AI增强监控、AI增强加公开羞辱，测量感知能力、风险、透明度和接受度。

Result: 传统监控在所有地区最受欢迎，公开羞辱最不受欢迎。中国受访者对AI增强监控模式的接受度显著高于欧洲和美国受访者。

Conclusion: 在考虑AI增强监控时，必须考虑背景、文化和社会规范，因为这些因素塑造了信任、舒适度和整体接受度。

Abstract: AI-powered road surveillance systems are increasingly proposed to monitor
infractions such as speeding, phone use, and jaywalking. While these systems
promise to enhance safety by discouraging dangerous behaviors, they also raise
concerns about privacy, fairness, and potential misuse of personal data. Yet
empirical research on how people perceive AI-enhanced monitoring of public
spaces remains limited. We conducted an online survey ($N=720$) using a
3$\times$3 factorial design to examine perceptions of three road surveillance
modes -- conventional, AI-enhanced, and AI-enhanced with public shaming --
across China, Europe, and the United States. We measured perceived capability,
risk, transparency, and acceptance. Results show that conventional surveillance
was most preferred, while public shaming was least preferred across all
regions. Chinese respondents, however, expressed significantly higher
acceptance of AI-enhanced modes than Europeans or Americans. Our findings
highlight the need to account for context, culture, and social norms when
considering AI-enhanced monitoring, as these shape trust, comfort, and overall
acceptance.

Abstract: What if future dining involved eating robots? We explore this question
through a playful and poetic experiential dinner theater: a tangible design
fiction staged as a 2052 Paris restaurant where diners consume a biohybrid
flying robot in place of the banned delicacy of ortolan bunting. Moving beyond
textual or visual speculation, our ``dinner-in-the-drama'' combined
performance, ritual, and multisensory immersion to provoke reflection on
sustainability, ethics, and cultural identity. Six participants from creative
industries engaged as diners and role-players, responding with curiosity,
discomfort, and philosophical debate. They imagined biohybrids as both
plausible and unsettling -- raising questions of sentience, symbolism, and
technology adoption that exceed conventional sustainability framings of
synthetic meat. Our contributions to HCI are threefold: (i) a speculative
artifact that stages robots as food, (ii) empirical insights into how publics
negotiate cultural and ethical boundaries in post-natural eating, and (iii) a
methodological advance in embodied, multisensory design fiction.

our findings reveal several cases of these surveillance infrastructures
intersecting. Continuation of our work will involve collecting cases from a

the carceral system, we will facilitate discussions with restorative justice
activists around cultivating solidarity and empowerment focused on the
interconnected nature of workplace and carceral surveillance technologies.

*Yuwei Xiao,Shuai Ma,Antti Oulasvirta,Eunice Jun*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: PriorWeaver是一个交互式可视化系统，通过迭代数据集构建和精炼来促进贝叶斯分析中的先验分布设定，让用户直观表达变量假设并自动生成统计先验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贝叶斯分析中先验设定是重要但困难的一步，现有工具要求用户将信念间接转化为模型参数的概率分布，这给分析师带来了挑战。

Method: 开发交互式可视化系统PriorWeaver，用户通过视觉方式表达变量及其关系的假设，系统将这些假设转化为数据集并自动推导统计先验，通过先验预测检查帮助用户验证先验与假设的一致性。

Result: 在17名贝叶斯分析新手的实验室研究中，与包含现有技术的基线相比，PriorWeaver给参与者提供了更好的控制性、清晰度和信心，生成的先验更符合他们的预期。

Conclusion: PriorWeaver通过直观的可视化交互界面有效解决了贝叶斯先验设定的挑战，显著提升了用户体验和先验质量。

Abstract: In Bayesian analysis, prior elicitation, or the process of explicating one's
beliefs to inform statistical modeling, is an essential yet challenging step.
Analysts often have beliefs about real-world variables and their relationships.
However, existing tools require analysts to translate these beliefs and express
them indirectly as probability distributions over model parameters. We present
PriorWeaver, an interactive visualization system that facilitates prior
elicitation through iterative dataset construction and refinement. Analysts
visually express their assumptions about individual variables and their
relationships. Under the hood, these assumptions create a dataset used to
derive statistical priors. Prior predictive checks then help analysts compare
the priors to their assumptions. In a lab study with 17 participants new to
Bayesian analysis, we compare PriorWeaver to a baseline incorporating existing
techniques. Compared to the baseline, PriorWeaver gave participants greater
control, clarity, and confidence, leading to priors that were better aligned
with their expectations.

*Xinyun Cao,Kexin Phyllis Ju,Chenglin Li,Venkatesh Potluri,Dhruv Jain*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: RAVEN系统利用生成式AI，通过自然语言查询和修改3D虚拟场景，为盲人和低视力用户提供动态可访问性支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决盲人和低视力用户在3D虚拟环境中面临的空间感知、导航和交互挑战，现有方法的静态特性限制了动态适应性。

Method: 开发RAVEN系统，允许用户通过自然语言提示查询或修改3D场景，实现运行时可访问性改进。

Result: 对8名盲人和低视力用户的评估显示，生成式AI驱动的可访问性方法具有潜力，但也存在系统可靠性和用户信任方面的挑战。

Conclusion: 生成式AI为3D虚拟环境可访问性提供了灵活性和控制力，但需要解决可靠性和信任问题才能充分发挥其潜力。

Abstract: As virtual 3D environments become prevalent, equitable access is crucial for
blind and low-vision (BLV) users who face challenges with spatial awareness,
navigation, and interactions. To address this gap, previous work explored
supplementing visual information with auditory and haptic modalities. However,
these methods are static and offer limited support for dynamic, in-context
adaptation. Recent work in generative AI enables users to query and modify 3D
scenes via natural language, introducing a paradigm with increased flexibility
and control for accessibility improvements. We present RAVEN, a system that
responds to query or modification prompts from BLV users to improve the runtime
accessibility of 3D virtual scenes. We evaluated the system with eight BLV
people, uncovering key insights into the strengths and shortcomings of
generative AI-driven accessibility in virtual 3D environments, pointing to
promising results as well as challenges related to system reliability and user
trust.

### [251] [Investigating Students' Preferences for AI Roles in Mathematical Modelling: Evidence from a Randomized Controlled Trial](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06617)
*Wangda Zhu,Guang Chen,Yumeng Zhu,Lei Cai,Xiangen Hu*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了学生在数学建模过程中设计思维、计算思维与数学建模自我效能感之间的关系，以及他们对AI不同角色（导师、工具、协作者、同伴）的偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数学建模是解决复杂现实问题的关键能力，但学生在抽象、表示和迭代推理方面存在困难。虽然AI被提议支持高阶思维，但其在数学建模教育中的作用尚未充分探索。

Method: 采用随机对照试验，研究学生设计思维、计算思维和数学建模自我效能感之间的关系，并调查他们在建模过程中对不同AI角色的偏好。

Result: 发现DT、CT和MMSE之间存在显著关联，学生在AI角色偏好上表现出不同模式，包括AI作为导师、工具、协作者和同伴。不同学习者档案存在差异，表明学生倾向性影响他们对AI的期望。

Conclusion: 这些发现推进了对AI支持数学建模的理解，并为设计自适应、以学习者为中心的系统提供了启示。

Abstract: Mathematical modelling (MM) is a key competency for solving complex
real-world problems, yet many students struggle with abstraction,
representation, and iterative reasoning. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been
proposed as a support for higher-order thinking, but its role in MM education
is still underexplored. This study examines the relationships among students'
design thinking (DT), computational thinking (CT), and mathematical modelling
self-efficacy (MMSE), and investigates their preferences for different AI roles
during the modelling process. Using a randomized controlled trial, we identify
significant connections among DT, CT, and MMSE, and reveal distinct patterns in
students' preferred AI roles, including AI as a tutor (providing explanations
and feedback), AI as a tool (assisting with calculations and representations),
AI as a collaborator (suggesting strategies and co-creating models), and AI as
a peer (offering encouragement and fostering reflection). Differences across
learner profiles highlight how students' dispositions shape their expectations
for AI. These findings advance understanding of AI-supported MM and provide
design implications for adaptive, learner-centered systems.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究探讨老年人在与家庭语音AI系统交互时如何应对对话中断，识别了四种对话中断类型，并展示了老年人如何利用情境知识和环境来理解和恢复对话。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为老年人设计对话AI系统不仅需要可用性和可靠性，还需要在处理对话中断时具备鲁棒性。

Method: 通过20周的家庭部署研究，与7对老年参与者分析844条录音交互，识别对话中断和用户发起的修复策略，并结合部署后访谈进行分析。

Result: 识别了四种对话中断类型，发现老年人利用情境知识和环境来理解和恢复对话中断，但需要付出认知努力。

Conclusion: 强调人机交互的协作性质，AI系统需要更好地与用户对记忆、日常习惯和环境资源的期望保持一致，并整合老年人社会技术环境中的情境知识。

Abstract: Designing Conversational AI systems to support older adults requires more
than usability and reliability, it also necessitates robustness in handling
conversational breakdowns. In this study, we investigate how older adults
navigate and repair such breakdowns while interacting with a voice-based AI
system deployed in their homes for medication management. Through a 20-week
in-home deployment with 7 older adult participant dyads, we analyzed 844
recoded interactions to identify conversational breakdowns and user-initiated
repair strategies. Through findings gleaned from post-deployment interviews, we
reflect on the nature of these breakdowns and older adults' experiences of
mitigating them. We identify four types of conversational breakdowns and
demonstrate how older adults draw on their situated knowledge and environment
to make sense of and recover from these disruptions, highlighting the cognitive
effort required in doing so. Our findings emphasize the collaborative nature of
interactions in human-AI contexts, and point to the need for AI systems to
better align with users' expectations for memory, their routines, and external
resources in their environment. We conclude by discussing opportunities for AI
systems to integrate contextual knowledge from older adults' sociotechnical
environment and to facilitate more meaningful and user-centered interactions.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究探索老年人对AI生成解释的偏好，发现解释的有效性高度依赖上下文，包括对话内容、语气和框架，并揭示了老年人倾向于将解释视为多轮交互对话。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究强调AI可解释性对建立用户信任的重要性，但对老年人对AI生成解释的需求和认知了解甚少，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 采用探索性的Speed Dating研究方法，与23名老年人进行访谈，了解他们对基于上下文的AI解释的反应。

Result: 发现解释具有高度上下文依赖性，受对话线索影响；老年人将解释视为与AI的多轮对话互动；解释有助于校准紧急程度、指导行动性，并为家庭成员提供老年人日常生活的洞察。

Conclusion: 讨论了为对话AI系统设计上下文敏感和个性化解释的设计启示。

Abstract: Designing Conversational AI systems to support older adults requires these
systems to explain their behavior in ways that align with older adults'
preferences and context. While prior work has emphasized the importance of AI
explainability in building user trust, relatively little is known about older
adults' requirements and perceptions of AI-generated explanations. To address
this gap, we conducted an exploratory Speed Dating study with 23 older adults
to understand their responses to contextually grounded AI explanations. Our
findings reveal the highly context-dependent nature of explanations, shaped by
conversational cues such as the content, tone, and framing of explanation. We
also found that explanations are often interpreted as interactive, multi-turn
conversational exchanges with the AI, and can be helpful in calibrating
urgency, guiding actionability, and providing insights into older adults' daily
lives for their family members. We conclude by discussing implications for
designing context-sensitive and personalized explanations in Conversational AI
systems.

### [254] [Lonely Individuals Show Distinct Patterns of Social Media Engagement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06733)
*Yajing Wang,Talayeh Aledavood,Juhi Kulshrestha*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究表明，社交媒体使用与孤独感呈正相关，孤独者在视觉分享、消息和社交网络平台上花费更多时间，且在桌面端表现为更短但更频繁的会话。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球孤独感已达到流行程度，社交媒体日益成为社交互动媒介，但现有调查研究的发现不一致，且缺乏对社交媒体使用行为模式和平台类型差异的客观了解。

Method: 结合六个月的网络追踪数据和重复调查，分析589名移动用户和851名桌面用户的社交媒体使用模式与孤独感的关系。

Result: 社交媒体使用与孤独感呈正相关，孤独者在移动设备上更多使用视觉分享、消息和社交网络平台，在桌面端表现为更短但更频繁的会话。

Conclusion: 纵向网络追踪数据能揭示与孤独感相关的行为模式，为研究其他心理状态提供了数字痕迹的潜力，并为支持心理健康的数字干预和平台设计提供参考。

Abstract: Loneliness has reached epidemic proportions globally, posing serious risks to
mental and physical health. As social media platforms increasingly mediate
social interaction, understanding their relationship with loneliness has become
urgent. While survey-based research has examined social media use and
loneliness, findings remain mixed, and little is known about when and how often
people engage with social media, or about whether different types of platforms
are differently associated with loneliness. Web trace data now enable objective
examination of these behavioral dimensions. We asked whether objectively
measured patterns of social media engagement differ between lonely and
non-lonely individuals across devices and platform types. Analyzing six months
of web trace data combined with repeated surveys ($N=589$ mobile users; $N=851$
desktop users), we found that greater social media use was associated with
higher loneliness across both devices, with this relationship specific to
social media rather than other online activities. On desktop, lonely
individuals exhibited shorter sessions but more frequent daily engagement.
Lonely individuals spent more time on visual-sharing ($g = -0.47$), messaging
($g = -0.36$), and networking-oriented platforms on mobile. These findings
demonstrate how longitudinal web trace data can reveal behavioral patterns
associated with loneliness, and more broadly illustrate the potential of
digital traces for studying other psychological states. Beyond research, the
results inform the responsible design of digital interventions and platform
features that better support psychological well-being across different
technological contexts.

Motivation: 理解零样本LLMs和提示使用对图表阅读任务的影响，特别是在GPT-4V无法正确回答的困难图像实例上。

Method: 使用107个可视化问题测试LLMs，比较GPT-5和多模态GPT-4V的推理准确性，分析不同提示变体的效果。

Result: 模型架构主导推理准确性：GPT-5显著提高了准确性，而提示变体仅产生微小影响。

Conclusion: 在图表阅读任务中，模型架构比提示工程对推理准确性有更大的影响，GPT-5相比GPT-4V有显著改进。

Abstract: We present a quantitative evaluation to understand the effect of zero-shot
large-language model (LLMs) and prompting uses on chart reading tasks. We asked
LLMs to answer 107 visualization questions to compare inference accuracies
between the agentic GPT-5 and multimodal GPT-4V, for difficult image instances,
where GPT-4V failed to produce correct answers. Our results show that model
architecture dominates the inference accuracy: GPT5 largely improved accuracy,
while prompt variants yielded only small effects. Pre-registration of this work

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着远程工作普及，知识工作者面临生产力挑战，但现有任务管理应用的有效性尚不明确

Method: 基于现有框架，通过为期2周的混合方法日记研究和半结构化访谈，调查远程知识工作者的生产力需求和挑战

Result: 使用数字任务管理应用与使用纸笔在改善远程工作者感知生产力方面没有显著差异

Conclusion: 需要更好的任务管理应用个性化

Abstract: As the world continues to change, more and more knowledge workers are
embracing remote work. Yet this comes with its challenges for their
productivity, and while many Task Management applications promise to improve
the productivity of remote workers, it remains unclear how effective they are.
Based on existing frameworks, this study investigated the productivity needs
and challenges of remote knowledge workers and how they use Task Management
tools. The research was conducted through a 2-week long, mixed-methods diary
study and semi-structured interview. Perceptions of productivity, task
management tool use and productivity challenges were observed. The findings
show that using a digital Task Management application made no significant
difference to using pen and paper for improving perceived productivity of
remote workers and discuss the need for better personalization of Task
Management applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有原型设计和评估方法无法应对实时多模态AI助手所需的复杂情境和上下文即时性，特别是在支持特定领域任务时。

Method: 采用反事实视频回放提示和混合Wizard-of-Oz方法，迭代设计和优化智能体行为。

Result: 开发了实用的指南和开源工具包，帮助UX设计师、HCI研究人员和AI工具开发者构建更用户中心和上下文感知的多模态智能体。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了多模态AI助手原型设计的挑战，提供了有效的设计框架和工具支持。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal generative AI (GenAI) enable the creation
of personal context-aware real-time agents that, for example, can augment user
workflows by following their on-screen activities and providing contextual
assistance. However, prototyping such experiences is challenging, especially
when supporting people with domain-specific tasks using real-time inputs such
as speech and screen recordings. While prototyping an LLM-based proactive
support agent system, we found that existing prototyping and evaluation methods
were insufficient to anticipate the nuanced situational complexity and
contextual immediacy required. To overcome these challenges, we explored a
novel user-centered prototyping approach that combines counterfactual video
replay prompting and hybrid Wizard-of-Oz methods to iteratively design and
refine agent behaviors. This paper discusses our prototyping experiences,
highlighting successes and limitations, and offers a practical guide and an
open-source toolkit for UX designers, HCI researchers, and AI toolmakers to
build more user-centered and context-aware multimodal agents.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 开发并验证了PUGenAIS-9量表，用于评估生成式AI的问题使用，发现其符合IGD框架中的情感脆弱亚型特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于对生成式AI潜在过度病理化的担忧以及缺乏概念清晰度，需要开发实证工具和理论完善。

Method: 使用中国和美国样本进行验证性因子分析，确定了31项结构，然后从中选出9个最高负荷项形成PUGenAIS-9量表，并在独立样本中验证。

Result: PUGenAIS-9量表在国籍和性别上具有测量不变性，网络分析和潜在剖面分析显示其匹配IGD的情感脆弱亚型特征。

Conclusion: 支持使用PUGenAIS-9识别问题性GenAI使用，并建议采用ICD模型重新思考数字成瘾，避免过度病理化。

Abstract: Concerns over the potential over-pathologization of generative AI (GenAI) use
and the lack of conceptual clarity surrounding GenAI addiction call for
empirical tools and theoretical refinement. This study developed and validated
the PUGenAIS-9 (Problematic Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence Scale-9
items) and examined whether PUGenAIS reflects addiction-like patterns under the
Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) framework. Using samples from China and the
United States (N = 1,508), we conducted confirmatory factor analysis and
identified a robust 31-item structure across nine IGD-based dimensions. We then
derived the PUGenAIS-9 by selecting the highest-loading items from each
dimension and validated its structure in an independent sample (N = 1,426).
Measurement invariance tests confirmed its stability across nationality and
gender. Person-centered (latent profile analysis) and variable-centered
(network analysis) approaches found that PUGenAIS matches the traits of the
emotionally vulnerable subtype of IGD, not the competence-based kind. These
results support using PUGenAIS-9 to identify problematic GenAI use and show the
need to rethink digital addiction with an ICD (infrastructures, content, and
device) model. This keeps addiction research responsive to new media while
avoiding over-pathologizing.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 该研究开发了心理测量学验证的量表，用于定量评估用户对表格输入特征的理解程度，包括数值型和分类型数据各一个量表，每个量表包含两个因子和8-9个项目，旨在为特征理解度打分排序。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统日益普及，审计AI系统变得重要，但可解释性方法需要针对不同受众。现有XAI方法假设用户理解输入特征，但实际上用户对特征的理解程度不同，目前缺乏评估用户特征理解度的量化方法。

Method: 开发了心理测量学验证的量表：一个针对数值型数据，一个针对分类型数据，每个量表包含两个因子和8-9个项目。通过验证性因子分析验证了项目与因子结构的良好拟合关系。

Result: 验证性因子分析显示量表项目与因子结构之间存在强关联，两个量表的两因子结构都具有良好拟合度。量表能够为每个输入特征分配理解度分数，实现特征排序和优先级量化。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种评估用户对表格输入特征理解度的新方法，为可解释人工智能领域提供了潜在应用，有助于系统设计者选择用户易于理解的特征来生成全局解释。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly pervasive and powerful, the
ability to audit AI-based systems is becoming increasingly important. However,
explainability for artificial intelligence systems is not a one-size-fits-all
solution; different target audiences have varying requirements and expectations
for explanations. While various approaches to explainability have been
proposed, most explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods for tabular
data focus on explaining the outputs of supervised machine learning models
using the input features. However, a user's ability to understand an
explanation depends on their understanding of such features. Therefore, it is
in the best interest of the system designer to try to pre-select understandable
features for producing a global explanation of an ML model. Unfortunately, no
measure currently exists to assess the degree to which a user understands a
given input feature. This work introduces psychometrically validated scales
that quantitatively seek to assess users' understanding of tabular input
features for supervised classification problems. In detail, these scales, one
for numerical and one for categorical data, each with two factors and
comprising 8 and 9 items, aim to assign a score to each input feature,
effectively producing a rank, and allowing for the quantification of feature
prioritisation. A confirmatory factor analysis demonstrates a strong
relationship between such items and a good fit of the two-factor structure for
each scale. This research presents a novel method for assessing understanding
and outlines potential applications in the domain of explainable artificial
intelligence.

Abstract: As robotic technologies evolve, their potential in artistic creation becomes
an increasingly relevant topic of inquiry. This study explores how professional
abstract artists perceive and experience co-creative interactions with an
autonomous painting robotic arm. Eight artists engaged in six painting sessions
-- three with a human partner, followed by three with the robot -- and
subsequently participated in semi-structured interviews analyzed through
reflexive thematic analysis. Human-human interactions were described as
intuitive, dialogic, and emotionally engaging, whereas human-robot sessions
felt more playful and reflective, offering greater autonomy and prompting for
novel strategies to overcome the system's limitations. This work offers one of
the first empirical investigations into artists' lived experiences with a
robot, highlighting the value of long-term engagement and a multidisciplinary
approach to human-robot co-creation.

of designing an AI system to support their work. By co-designing an evaluation
framework for large language models with the practitioners, we hope to push
back against the exclusionary status quo of AI and extent AI's potentiality to
a historically marginalized community.

TL;DR: 本文研究了XR中基于凝视的导航，通过用户实验评估了三种代表性路径类型（线性、窄化和圆形）的性能表现，为未来XR凝视导航系统提供了设计指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 凝视输入作为传达用户意图的模态，在XR中提供了直观沉浸的体验。虽然凝视已被广泛应用于选择、文本输入等任务，但作为基础交互任务的凝视导航仍未被充分探索，特别是哪些路径类型适合凝视导航及其有效工作条件尚不清楚。

Method: 进行了受控用户研究，评估了三种代表性路径类型（线性、窄化和圆形）的凝视导航性能。

Result: 研究发现每种路径类型具有不同的性能特征和参数范围，揭示了凝视导航在不同路径条件下的表现特点。

Conclusion: 研究结果为未来XR凝视驱动导航系统提供了设计见解和实用指南。

Abstract: Gaze input, as a modality inherently conveying user intent, offers intuitive
and immersive experiences in extended reality (XR). With eye-tracking now being
a standard feature in modern XR headsets, gaze has been extensively applied to
tasks such as selection, text entry, and object manipulation. However, gaze
based navigation despite being a fundamental interaction task remains largely
underexplored. In particular, little is known about which path types are well
suited for gaze navigation and under what conditions it performs effectively.
To bridge this gap, we conducted a controlled user study evaluating gaze-based
navigation across three representative path types: linear, narrowing, and
circular. Our findings reveal distinct performance characteristics and
parameter ranges for each path type, offering design insights and practical
guidelines for future gaze-driven navigation systems in XR.

TL;DR: 研究尼泊尔TikTok禁令的影响，发现用户对平台禁令持怀疑态度但被动接受，强调需要建立鼓励公众审议的集体治理模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着TikTok等社交媒体平台在全球通信中日益重要，政治讨论中的禁令可能对边缘化社区产生重大影响。尼泊尔作为数字通信快速发展的低资源国家，其TikTok禁令案例提供了研究数字技术、政策响应和文化动态相互作用的独特机会。

Method: 在尼泊尔实施并解除TikTok禁令后，通过在线调查（N=108）探索用户价值观、体验和在线空间导航策略。

Result: 用户对平台禁令表达怀疑但往往被动接受，没有积极反对。研究强调了建立集体治理模式的重要性。

Conclusion: 需要制度化的集体治理模型，鼓励公众审议、细致控制和与社会共鸣的政策决策，以更好地管理数字技术与社会规范的互动。

Abstract: Social media platforms have transformed global communication and interaction,
with TikTok emerging as a critical tool for education, connection, and social
impact, including in contexts where infrastructural resources are limited. Amid
growing political discussions about banning platforms like TikTok, such actions
can create significant ripple effects, particularly impacting marginalized
communities. We present a study on Nepal, where a TikTok ban was recently
imposed and lifted. As a low-resource country in transition where digital
communication is rapidly evolving, TikTok enables a space for community
engagement and cultural expression. In this context, we conducted an online
survey (N=108) to explore user values, experiences, and strategies for
navigating online spaces post-ban. By examining these transitions, we aim to
improve our understanding of how digital technologies, policy responses, and
cultural dynamics interact globally and their implications for governance and
societal norms. Our results indicate that users express skepticism toward
platform bans but often passively accept them without active opposition.
Findings suggest the importance of institutionalizing collective governance
models that encourage public deliberation, nuanced control, and socially
resonant policy decisions.

recommendations for future work as there are several paths to continue the work
in this field.

object with a smartphone video, upload it for automated 3D reconstruction, and
visualize it interactively in Unity at an average of 150 frames per second
(fps) on a laptop. The system integrates mobile capture, cloud-based 3D GS and
Unity rendering to support real-time telepresence. Our experiments show that
the pipeline processes scans in approximately 10 minutes on a graphics
processing unit (GPU) achieving real-time rendering on the laptop.

TL;DR: 提出了一个针对隐式曲面的几何查询框架，使Walk on Stars方法能够应用于隐式边界定义的PDE求解问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏可靠的几何查询方法阻碍了Walk on Stars在隐式曲面边界上的应用，限制了该先进PDE求解器的适用范围

Method: 将WoSt查询表述为约束全局优化或约束满足问题，采用基于区间分析的分支定界方法求解高度非凸问题

Result: 首次实现了在封闭隐式曲面上的最近轮廓点查询和Robin半径边界查询，使WoSt能够在隐式边界上实现无网格PDE求解

Conclusion: 提出的框架和方法首次使Walk on Stars能够处理隐式曲面边界，扩展了该先进PDE求解器的应用范围

Abstract: Walk on stars (WoSt) is currently one of the most advanced Monte Carlo
solvers for PDEs. Unfortunately, the lack of reliable geometric query
approaches has hindered its applicability to boundaries defined by implicit
surfaces. This work proposes a geometric query framework over closed implicit
surfaces for WoSt, under the scope of walkin' Robin. Our key observation is
that all WoSt queries can be formulated as constrained global optimization or
constraint satisfaction problems. Based on our formulations, to solve the
highly non-convex problems, we adopt a branch-and-bound approach based on
interval analysis. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first to
study closest silhouette point queries and Robin radius bound queries on closed
implicit surfaces. Our formulations and methods first enable mesh-free PDE
solving via WoSt when boundaries are defined by closed implicit surfaces.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AlphaApollo是一个自演化的智能推理系统，通过整合多个模型和专业工具来解决基础模型推理能力有限和测试时迭代不可靠的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基础模型推理能力的内在限制和测试时迭代不可靠性这两个瓶颈问题。

Method: 使用计算工具（Python与数值/符号库）和检索工具（任务相关外部信息）进行精确计算和决策基础，通过共享状态地图支持多轮多模型解决方案演化。

Result: 在AIME 2024/2025评估中，AlphaApollo为Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct带来+5.15% Average@32和+23.34% Pass@32提升，为Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct带来+8.91% Average@32和+26.67% Pass@32提升，工具调用成功率超过80%。

Conclusion: AlphaApollo通过工具集成和迭代优化，有效提升了基础模型的能力上限，在复杂推理任务中表现优异。

Abstract: We present AlphaApollo, a self-evolving agentic reasoning system that aims to
address two bottlenecks in foundation model (FM) reasoning-limited
model-intrinsic capacity and unreliable test-time iteration. AlphaApollo
orchestrates multiple models with professional tools to enable deliberate,
verifiable reasoning. It couples (i) a computation tool (Python with numerical
and symbolic libraries) and (ii) a retrieval tool (task-relevant external
information) to execute exact calculations and ground decisions. The system
further supports multi-round, multi-model solution evolution via a shared state
map that records candidates, executable checks, and feedback for iterative
refinement. In evaluations on AIME 2024/2025 across multiple models,
AlphaApollo delivers consistent gains: +5.15% Average@32 and +23.34% Pass@32
for Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, and +8.91% Average@32 with +26.67% Pass@32 for
Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. Tool-use analysis shows that more than 80% of tool
calls are successfully executed, with consistent outperformance of non-tool
baselines, thereby lifting the capability ceiling of FMs. More empirical
results and implementation details will be updated at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了复杂性分布外泛化框架来定义和衡量推理能力，强调当测试实例所需的最小解决方案复杂性超过所有训练示例时，模型仍能保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI研究缺乏对推理能力的明确定义和度量标准，需要建立一个统一框架来形式化评估推理能力。

Method: 通过解决方案描述的柯尔莫哥洛夫复杂性和操作代理来形式化复杂性，区分复杂性OoD与长度和组合性OoD的不同。

Result: 该框架将学习和推理统一起来，表明许多在低复杂度下可通过System1处理的情况在复杂度压力下需要System2处理。

Conclusion: 由于复杂性OoD不能仅通过扩展数据解决，需要开发能够明确建模和分配计算资源的架构和训练机制。

Abstract: Recent progress has pushed AI frontiers from pattern recognition tasks toward
problems that require step by step, System2 style reasoning, especially with
large language models. Yet, unlike learning, where generalization and out of
distribution (OoD) evaluation concepts are well formalized, there is no clear,
consistent definition or metric for reasoning ability. We propose Complexity
Out of Distribution (Complexity OoD) generalization as a framework and problem
setting to define and measure reasoning. A model exhibits Complexity OoD
generalization when it maintains performance on test instances whose minimal
required solution complexity, either representational (richer solution
structure) or computational (more reasoning steps/program length), exceeds that
of all training examples. We formalize complexity via solution description
Kolmogorov complexity and operational proxies (e.g., object/relation counts;
reasoning step counts), clarifying how Complexity OoD differs from length and
compositional OoD. This lens unifies learning and reasoning: many cases
solvable with System1 like processing at low complexity become System2 like
under complexity pressure, while System2 can be viewed as generalization over
solution structures. We translate this perspective into practice with
recommendations for operationalizing Complexity OoD across the stack:
incorporating complexity into benchmark and evaluation metric design,
rethinking supervision to target solution traces, seeking and designing
inductive biases for Complexity OoD generalization, addressing learning to
reason spillovers such as spurious shortcuts, semantic robustness, catastrophic
forgetting, and step wise calibration. Because Complexity OoD cannot be solved
by scaling data alone, progress toward robust reasoning will require
architectures and training regimes that explicitly model and allocate
computation with respect to complexity.

TL;DR: 提出了BuilderBench基准测试，用于评估智能体通过开放式探索学习构建结构的能力，包含42个多样化目标结构和硬件加速模拟器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型主要通过模仿学习，难以解决超出已有数据范围的新问题。需要开发能够通过交互经验学习的智能体。

Method: 使用硬件加速的机器人模拟器，让智能体在无外部监督下探索学习物理环境原理，然后评估其在未见目标结构上的构建能力。

Result: 实验表明当前算法在BuilderBench的许多任务上仍面临挑战，为此提供了简化训练协议和六种算法的参考实现。

Conclusion: BuilderBench为研究智能体预训练和开放式探索提供了重要基准，需要发展能够进行具身推理的算法。

Abstract: Today's AI models learn primarily through mimicry and sharpening, so it is
not surprising that they struggle to solve problems beyond the limits set by
existing data. To solve novel problems, agents should acquire skills for
exploring and learning through experience. Finding a scalable learning
mechanism for developing agents that learn through interaction remains a major
open problem. In this work, we introduce BuilderBench, a benchmark to
accelerate research into agent pre-training that centers open-ended
exploration. BuilderBench requires agents to learn how to build any structure
using blocks. BuilderBench is equipped with $(1)$ a hardware accelerated
simulator of a robotic agent interacting with various physical blocks, and
$(2)$ a task-suite with over 42 diverse target structures that are carefully
curated to test an understanding of physics, mathematics, and long-horizon
planning. During training, agents have to explore and learn general principles
about the environment without any external supervision. During evaluation,
agents have to build the unseen target structures from the task suite. Solving
these tasks requires a sort of \emph{embodied reasoning} that is not reflected
in words but rather in actions, experimenting with different strategies and
piecing them together. Our experiments show that many of these tasks challenge
the current iteration of algorithms. Hence, we also provide a ``training
wheels'' protocol, in which agents are trained and evaluated to build a single
target structure from the task suite. Finally, we provide single-file
implementations of six different algorithms as a reference point for
researchers.

Motivation: 并购后信息系统集成面临独特挑战，现有培训方法存在学习曲线高和学习者动机低的问题，需要更有效的培训方式。

Method: 分析基础学习理论、认知负荷与动机模型、严肃游戏设计框架，确定游戏化学习设计框架的关键要求，分为转换过程和结果学习体验两个组成部分。

Conclusion: 计划通过迭代设计和实际验证来开发和评估所提出的框架，以改善信息系统集成培训效果。

Abstract: Post-merger integration states unique challenges for professionals
responsible for information system integration aimed on alignment and
combination diverse system architectures of merging organizations. Although the
theoretical and practical guidance exists for post-merger integration on the
business level, there is a significant gap in training for information system
integration in this context. In prior research specific methods AMILI (Support
method for informed decision identification) and AMILP (Support method for
informed decision-making) were introduced for the support of information system
integration decisions in the post-merger integration. But during the practical
application was reported high learning curve and low learner motivation. This
paper explores how game-based learning design can address these limitations by
transforming static method training into engaging learning experience. The
study analyzes foundational learning theories, cognitive load and motivation
models, and serious game design frameworks to identify the essential
requirements for a game-based learning design framework tailored to information
system integration in post-merger integration. Requirements are structured in
two components: the transformation process and resulting learning experience.
The paper concludes with a plan for developing and evaluating the proposed
framework through iterative design and real-world validation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于词典序偏好的多目标多智能体路径规划框架LCBS，避免构建帕累托前沿，直接计算符合偏好排序的单一解，显著提升可扩展性至10个目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MO-MAPF算法即使已知用户偏好也不优化，且目标数量增加时扩展性差，需要能直接利用偏好信息的高效算法。

Method: LCBS算法结合优先级感知的A*底层搜索与冲突搜索，避免帕累托前沿构建，通过词典序偏好指导规划。

Result: LCBS能计算最优解，扩展到10个目标，在标准基准测试中成功率显著高于现有方法，尤其目标数增加时优势更明显。

Conclusion: 词典序框架为MO-MAPF提供有效建模方法，LCBS通过偏好指导搜索实现高效规划，突破现有方法目标数量限制。

Abstract: Many real-world scenarios require multiple agents to coordinate in shared
environments, while balancing trade-offs between multiple, potentially
competing objectives. Current multi-objective multi-agent path finding
(MO-MAPF) algorithms typically produce conflict-free plans by computing Pareto
frontiers. They do not explicitly optimize for user-defined preferences, even
when the preferences are available, and scale poorly with the number of
objectives. We propose a lexicographic framework for modeling MO-MAPF, along
with an algorithm \textit{Lexicographic Conflict-Based Search} (LCBS) that
directly computes a single solution aligned with a lexicographic preference
over objectives. LCBS integrates a priority-aware low-level $A^*$ search with
conflict-based search, avoiding Pareto frontier construction and enabling
efficient planning guided by preference over objectives. We provide insights
into optimality and scalability, and empirically demonstrate that LCBS computes
optimal solutions while scaling to instances with up to ten objectives -- far
beyond the limits of existing MO-MAPF methods. Evaluations on standard and
randomized MAPF benchmarks show consistently higher success rates against
state-of-the-art baselines, especially with increasing number of objectives.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有共识寻求方法依赖投票机制，忽视了系统内部信念的矛盾，且采用无差别合作方式，无法为每个智能体找到最优合作者，导致共识不稳定。

Method: 提出了理论框架来选择最大化共识稳定性的最优合作者，并基于此开发了BCCS框架，通过选择最优合作者和校准系统内部信念的共识判断来促进稳定共识。

Result: 在MATH和MMLU基准数据集上的实验结果显示，BCCS框架在挑战性任务上的准确率分别比现有最佳结果提高了2.23%和3.95%。

Conclusion: BCCS框架通过优化合作者选择和共识判断校准，有效解决了多智能体系统中共识不稳定的问题，显著提升了复杂NLP任务的性能。

Abstract: A multi-agent system (MAS) enhances its capacity to solve complex natural
language processing (NLP) tasks through collaboration among multiple agents,
where consensus-seeking serves as a fundamental mechanism. However, existing
consensus-seeking approaches typically rely on voting mechanisms to judge
consensus, overlooking contradictions in system-internal beliefs that
destabilize the consensus. Moreover, these methods often involve agents
updating their results through indiscriminate collaboration with every other
agent. Such uniform interaction fails to identify the optimal collaborators for
each agent, hindering the emergence of a stable consensus. To address these
challenges, we provide a theoretical framework for selecting optimal
collaborators that maximize consensus stability. Based on the theorems, we
propose the Belief-Calibrated Consensus Seeking (BCCS) framework to facilitate
stable consensus via selecting optimal collaborators and calibrating the
consensus judgment by system-internal beliefs. Experimental results on the MATH
and MMLU benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed BCCS framework
outperforms the best existing results by 2.23% and 3.95% of accuracy on
challenging tasks, respectively. Our code and data are available at
https://github.com/dengwentao99/BCCS.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了推理大语言模型在协作推理中的表现，发现更强的模型在干扰下反而更脆弱，且所有模型都难以有效利用来自更强合作者的正确推理步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究推理LLMs是否具备评估和利用其他模型部分推理的能力（离轨推理），这是多模型在共享推理轨迹中协作的关键前提。

Method: 提出双测试方法评估离轨推理的两个极端：可恢复性（从误导推理中回溯）和可引导性（基于更强合作者的正确推理）。评估了15个开源LLMs（1.5B-32B），并分析了蒸馏教师选择、RL使用和数据选择策略的影响。

Result: 更强的模型在干扰下更脆弱；所有模型在超出自身能力的问题上利用引导步骤的解决率低于9.2%；教师模型的不佳可恢复性行为会传递给蒸馏学生。

Conclusion: 现成的推理LLMs在协作推理中存在局限性，为评估多模型协作提供了基础，并指出了训练原生强推理合作者的可行方向。

Abstract: Reasoning LLMs are trained to verbalize their reasoning process, yielding
strong gains on complex tasks. This transparency also opens a promising
direction: multiple reasoners can directly collaborate on each other's thinking
within a shared trajectory, yielding better inference efficiency and
exploration. A key prerequisite, however, is the ability to assess the
usefulness and build on another model's partial thinking -- we call this
off-trajectory reasoning. Our paper investigates a critical question: can
standard solo-reasoning training pipelines deliver desired off-trajectory
behaviors? We propose twin tests that capture the two extremes of the
off-trajectory spectrum, namely Recoverability, which tests whether LLMs can
backtrack from "distractions" induced by misleading reasoning traces, and
Guidability, which tests their ability to build upon correct reasoning from
stronger collaborators. Our study evaluates 15 open-weight LLMs (1.5B-32B) and
reveals a counterintuitive finding -- "stronger" LLMs on benchmarks are often
more fragile under distraction. Moreover, all models tested fail to effectively
leverage guiding steps from collaborators on problems beyond their inherent
capabilities with solve rates remaining under 9.2%. Finally, we conduct control
studies to isolate the effects of three factors in post-training on these
behaviors: the choice of distillation teacher, the use of RL, and data
selection strategy. Our results provide actionable insights for training
natively strong reasoning collaborators; e.g., we find that suboptimal
recoverability behaviors of teacher models are transferred to distilled
students even if the distillation trajectories are correct. Taken together,
this work lays the groundwork for evaluating multi-model collaborations in
shared reasoning trajectories and highlights the limitations of off-the-shelf
reasoning LLMs.

Motivation: 目前很少有研究使用语义网以标准化、机器可读的格式表示食物与健康之间的关系，这限制了有效利用这些知识的能力。

Method: 使用KNARM方法，结合USDA数据库中食物黄酮类化合物含量和文献中的癌症关联信息，构建知识图谱。

Result: 成功创建了一个知识图谱，能够以机器可操作的格式表示食物与健康之间的复杂关系，为研究人员探索饮食选择与疾病管理之间的相互作用提供了示例。

Conclusion: 该知识图谱为研究食物与健康关系提供了有效工具，未来工作将扩展图谱范围，添加更多相关数据并进行推理以发现隐藏关系。

Abstract: The focus on "food as medicine" is gaining traction in the field of health
and several studies conducted in the past few years discussed this aspect of
food in the literature. However, very little research has been done on
representing the relationship between food and health in a standardized,
machine-readable format using a semantic web that can help us leverage this
knowledge effectively. To address this gap, this study aims to create a
knowledge graph to link food and health through the knowledge graph's ability
to combine information from various platforms focusing on flavonoid contents of
food found in the USDA databases and cancer connections found in the
literature. We looked closely at these relationships using KNARM methodology
and represented them in machine-operable format. The proposed knowledge graph
serves as an example for researchers, enabling them to explore the complex
interplay between dietary choices and disease management. Future work for this
study involves expanding the scope of the knowledge graph by capturing nuances,
adding more related data, and performing inferences on the acquired knowledge
to uncover hidden relationships.

Abstract: This work investigates the reasoning and planning capabilities of foundation
models and their scalability in complex, dynamic environments. We introduce
PuzzlePlex, a benchmark designed to assess these capabilities through a diverse
set of puzzles. PuzzlePlex consists of 15 types of puzzles, including
deterministic and stochastic games of varying difficulty, as well as
single-player and two-player scenarios. The PuzzlePlex framework provides a
comprehensive environment for each game, and supports extensibility to generate
more challenging instances as foundation models evolve. Additionally, we
implement customized game-playing strategies for comparison. Building on this
benchmark, we develop fine-grained metrics to measure performance and conduct
an in-depth analysis of frontier foundation models across two settings:
instruction-based and code-based. Furthermore, we systematically investigate
their scaling limits. Our findings show that reasoning models outperform others
in instruction-based settings, while code-based execution presents greater
challenges but offers a scalable and efficient alternative. PuzzlePlex enables
targeted evaluation and guides future improvements in reasoning, planning, and
generalization for foundation models.

TL;DR: 提出了行为引导技术，通过识别并训练四种有益推理行为（信息验证、权威评估、自适应搜索、错误恢复）来提升智能搜索代理的性能，在多个基准测试中实现了超过35%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能搜索代理在处理复杂信息需求时面临推理和代理能力的挑战，需要研究有效的推理行为模式来提升性能。

Method: 提出推理驱动的LLM管道分析成功搜索轨迹，识别四种有益行为，然后通过行为引导技术将这些行为整合到模型中，包括监督微调和强化学习。

Result: 在GAIA、WebWalker和HLE三个基准测试中，行为引导技术使Llama3.2-3B和Qwen3-1.7B模型相比直接强化学习训练获得了超过35%的性能提升。

Conclusion: 期望的推理行为而非最终答案的正确性是实现强大最终性能的关键因素，这些行为赋予模型更有效的探索和测试时扩展能力。

Abstract: Agentic search leverages large language models (LLMs) to interpret complex
user information needs and execute a multi-step process of planning, searching,
and synthesizing information to provide answers. This paradigm introduces
unique challenges for LLMs' reasoning and agentic capabilities when interacting
with retrieval systems and the broader web. In this paper, we propose a
reasoning-driven LLM-based pipeline to study effective reasoning behavior
patterns in agentic search. Using this pipeline, we analyze successful agentic
search trajectories and identify four beneficial reasoning behaviors:
Information Verification, Authority Evaluation, Adaptive Search, and Error
Recovery. Based on these findings, we propose a technique called Behavior
Priming to train more effective agentic search models. It synthesizes agentic
search trajectories that exhibit these four behaviors and integrates them into
the agentic search model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by
standard reinforcement learning (RL). Experiments on three benchmarks (GAIA,
WebWalker, and HLE) demonstrate that behavior priming yields over 35% gains in
Llama3.2-3B and Qwen3-1.7B compared to directly training agentic search models
with RL. Crucially, we demonstrate that the desired reasoning behaviors in the
SFT data, rather than the correctness of the final answer, is the critical
factor for achieving strong final performance after RL: fine-tuning on
trajectories with desirable reasoning behaviors but incorrect answers leads to
better performance than fine-tuning on trajectories with correct answers. Our
analysis further reveals the underlying mechanism: the introduced reasoning
behaviors endow models with more effective exploration (higher pass@k and
entropy) and test-time scaling (longer trajectories) capabilities, providing a
strong foundation for RL. Our code will be released as open source.

TL;DR: 提出了Auto-Prompt Ensemble (APE)框架，通过自动学习评估维度来提升LLM评判者的可靠性，在Reward Bench基准上将GPT-4o的零样本一致性从87.2%提升到90.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM评判者经常遗漏关键评估维度，因为它们无法识别人类评估背后的隐含标准，导致评估可靠性不足。

Method: 开发了自适应框架APE，自动从失败案例中学习评估维度，并采用基于置信度的集成机制，通过Collective Confidence方法决定何时采用额外评估维度的判断。

Result: 在多个标准基准测试中，APE显著提升了LLM评判者的可靠性，特别是在Reward Bench上GPT-4o的零样本一致性提升了3.3个百分点。

Conclusion: APE为LLM评判者提供了利用测试时计算的原理性方法，弥合了人类与LLM评判者之间的评估差距。

Abstract: We present a novel framework that improves the reliability of LLM judges by
selectively augmenting LLM with auxiliary evaluation dimensions. Existing LLM
judges often miss crucial evaluation dimensions because they fail to recognize
the implicit standards underlying human assessments. To address this challenge,
we propose the Auto-Prompt Ensemble (APE), an adaptive framework that
automatically learns evaluation dimensions from its failure cases. APE
incorporates a confidence-based ensemble mechanism to decide when to adopt the
judgments from additional evaluation dimensions through a novel confidence
estimation approach called Collective Confidence. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that APE improves the reliability of LLM Judge across diverse
standard benchmarks. For instance, APE enhances GPT-4o agreement rate on Reward
Bench from 87.2% to 90.5% in the zero-shot setting. Overall, APE provides a
principled approach for LLM Judge to leverage test-time computation, and bridge
the evaluation gap between human and LLM judges.

Method: 将每个目标动态分解为三个专注子任务：导航、信息提取和执行，让模型一次专注于一项技能；并随着新网页的显示持续重新规划分解，利用新发现的过滤器或快捷方式，避免冗余探索。

Result: 在WebChoreArena上，WebDART比之前最先进的代理成功率提升高达13.7个百分点，在较简单的WebArena套件上表现相当，完成任务时导航步骤减少高达14.7步。

Conclusion: WebDART框架通过任务分解和持续重新规划，有效提升了LLM代理处理复杂网页任务的能力。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are becoming competent at straightforward
web tasks, such as opening an item page or submitting a form, but still
struggle with objectives that require long horizon navigation, large scale
information extraction, and reasoning under constraints. We present WebDART, a
general framework that enables a single LLM to handle such complex chores.
WebDART (i) dynamically decomposes each objective into three focused subtasks:
navigation, information extraction, and execution, so the model concentrates on
one skill at a time, and (ii) continuously replans the decomposition as new
webpages are revealed, taking advantage of newly discovered filters or
shortcuts and avoiding redundant exploration. Evaluated on WebChoreArena,
WebDART lifts success rates by up to 13.7 percentage points over previous SOTA
agents, while matching their performance on the easier WebArena suite and
completing tasks with up to 14.7 fewer navigation steps.

TL;DR: 提出EICL方法，通过引入情感相似示例和动态软标签策略改进细粒度情感识别中的决策过程，显著优于传统ICL方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ICL方法在细粒度情感识别中只关注推理过程而忽视了决策过程，且语义相似示例常引入情感差异导致识别错误。

Method: 提出EICL方法：1) 引入情感相似示例；2) 使用动态软标签策略改进查询表示；3) 采用两阶段排除策略从多角度评估相似性。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，EICL显著优于ICL方法。

Conclusion: 基于原型理论，EICL通过优化情感推理和决策过程，有效解决了ICL在细粒度情感识别中的局限性。

Abstract: Fine-grained emotion recognition aims to identify the emotional type in
queries through reasoning and decision-making processes, playing a crucial role
in various systems. Recent methods use In-Context Learning (ICL), enhancing the
representation of queries in the reasoning process through semantically similar
examples, while further improving emotion recognition by explaining the
reasoning mechanisms. However, these methods enhance the reasoning process but
overlook the decision-making process. This paper investigates decision-making
in fine-grained emotion recognition through prototype theory. We show that ICL
relies on similarity matching between query representations and emotional
prototypes within the model, where emotion-accurate representations are
critical. However, semantically similar examples often introduce emotional
discrepancies, hindering accurate representations and causing errors. To
address this, we propose Emotion In-Context Learning (EICL), which introduces
emotionally similar examples and uses a dynamic soft-label strategy to improve
query representations in the emotion reasoning process. A two-stage exclusion
strategy is then employed to assess similarity from multiple angles, further
optimizing the decision-making process. Extensive experiments show that EICL
significantly outperforms ICL on multiple datasets.

Abstract: We introduce an Agent-in-the-Loop (AITL) framework that implements a
continuous data flywheel for iteratively improving an LLM-based customer
support system. Unlike standard offline approaches that rely on batch
annotations, AITL integrates four key types of annotations directly into live
customer operations: (1) pairwise response preferences, (2) agent adoption and
rationales, (3) knowledge relevance checks, and (4) identification of missing
knowledge. These feedback signals seamlessly feed back into models' updates,
reducing retraining cycles from months to weeks. Our production pilot involving
US-based customer support agents demonstrated significant improvements in
retrieval accuracy (+11.7% recall@75, +14.8% precision@8), generation quality
(+8.4% helpfulness) and agent adoption rates (+4.5%). These results underscore
the effectiveness of embedding human feedback loops directly into operational
workflows to continuously refine LLM-based customer support system.

TL;DR: 本文分析了元代理设计智能体系统的三个关键挑战：跨迭代学习效率低、行为多样性不足以及经济可行性有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究自动化设计智能体系统的元代理方法在实际应用中的可行性和局限性。

Method: 通过实验分析元代理的跨迭代学习机制、行为多样性评估以及成本效益分析。

Result: 发现进化方法优于简单扩展上下文；设计的智能体行为多样性低；仅在少数情况下自动化设计具有经济优势。

Conclusion: 当前元代理方法在大多数实际场景中成本效益不高，需要改进学习机制和多样性设计。

Abstract: Recent works began to automate the design of agentic systems using
meta-agents that propose and iteratively refine new agent architectures. In
this paper, we examine three key challenges in a common class of meta-agents.
First, we investigate how a meta-agent learns across iterations and find that
simply expanding the context with all previous agents, as proposed by previous
works, performs worse than ignoring prior designs entirely. We show that the
performance improves with an evolutionary approach. Second, although the
meta-agent designs multiple agents during training, it typically commits to a
single agent at test time. We find that the designed agents have low behavioral
diversity, limiting the potential for their complementary use. Third, we assess
when automated design is economically viable. We find that only in a few
cases--specifically, two datasets--the overall cost of designing and deploying
the agents is lower than that of human-designed agents when deployed on over
15,000 examples. In contrast, the performance gains for other datasets do not
justify the design cost, regardless of scale.

Motivation: 传统机器学习方法在捕捉基因、疾病和认知过程之间复杂语义联系方面存在局限，大语言模型的出现为知识图谱整合提供了新的可能性。

Method: 使用GPT-4等大语言模型进行实体对齐、语义相似度计算和图增强，整合三个知识源：认知神经科学知识图谱、基因本体和疾病本体。

Result: 构建的MultiCNKG包含6.9K个节点和11.3K条边，评估指标显示精度85.20%、召回率87.30%、覆盖率92.18%、图一致性82.50%、新颖性检测40.28%、专家验证89.50%。链接预测性能与FB15k-237和WN18RR基准相当。

Conclusion: 该知识图谱推动了个性化医疗、认知障碍诊断和认知神经科学假设制定等应用的发展。

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the integration
of knowledge graphs (KGs) in biomedical and cognitive sciences, overcoming
limitations in traditional machine learning methods for capturing intricate
semantic links among genes, diseases, and cognitive processes. We introduce
MultiCNKG, an innovative framework that merges three key knowledge sources: the
Cognitive Neuroscience Knowledge Graph (CNKG) with 2.9K nodes and 4.3K edges
across 9 node types and 20 edge types; Gene Ontology (GO) featuring 43K nodes
and 75K edges in 3 node types and 4 edge types; and Disease Ontology (DO)
comprising 11.2K nodes and 8.8K edges with 1 node type and 2 edge types.
Leveraging LLMs like GPT-4, we conduct entity alignment, semantic similarity
computation, and graph augmentation to create a cohesive KG that interconnects
genetic mechanisms, neurological disorders, and cognitive functions. The
resulting MultiCNKG encompasses 6.9K nodes across 5 types (e.g., Genes,
Diseases, Cognitive Processes) and 11.3K edges spanning 7 types (e.g., Causes,
Associated with, Regulates), facilitating a multi-layered view from molecular
to behavioral domains. Assessments using metrics such as precision (85.20%),
recall (87.30%), coverage (92.18%), graph consistency (82.50%), novelty
detection (40.28%), and expert validation (89.50%) affirm its robustness and
coherence. Link prediction evaluations with models like TransE (MR: 391, MRR:
0.411) and RotatE (MR: 263, MRR: 0.395) show competitive performance against
benchmarks like FB15k-237 and WN18RR. This KG advances applications in
personalized medicine, cognitive disorder diagnostics, and hypothesis
formulation in cognitive neuroscience.

TL;DR: 提出了一个自动化验证基于LLM策略的工具，用于无记忆顺序决策任务中的安全性验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在顺序决策任务中的应用增多，需要确保这些基于LLM的策略满足安全性要求，因此开发了自动化验证工具。

Method: 通过增量构建MDP的可达部分，将状态编码为自然语言提示，解析LLM的响应为动作，并使用Storm模型检查器验证PCTL安全属性。

Result: 实验表明开源LLM在确定性种子下可被验证，但性能通常低于深度强化学习基线。

Conclusion: 该工具为验证日益强大的LLM提供了实用基础，支持用户指定的顺序决策任务中的持续基准测试。

Abstract: We introduce a tool for rigorous and automated verification of large language
model (LLM)- based policies in memoryless sequential decision-making tasks.
Given a Markov decision process (MDP) representing the sequential
decision-making task, an LLM policy, and a safety requirement expressed as a
PCTL formula, our approach incrementally constructs only the reachable portion
of the MDP guided by the LLM's chosen actions. Each state is encoded as a
natural language prompt, the LLM's response is parsed into an action, and
reachable successor states by the policy are expanded. The resulting formal
model is checked with Storm to determine whether the policy satisfies the
specified safety property. In experiments on standard grid world benchmarks, we
show that open source LLMs accessed via Ollama can be verified when
deterministically seeded, but generally underperform deep reinforcement
learning baselines. Our tool natively integrates with Ollama and supports
PRISM-specified tasks, enabling continuous benchmarking in user-specified
sequential decision-making tasks and laying a practical foundation for formally
verifying increasingly capable LLMs.

Motivation: 自动化端到端科研过程面临双重挑战：需要生成新颖且合理的高层计划，并在动态不确定条件下正确执行这些计划。

Method: DLMA框架包含两个循环：领导循环使用进化算法通过参与、改进和整合会议迭代生成和优化研究提案；跟随循环通过事前和事后会议动态调整计划执行，确保每个步骤得到上下文和外部观察的支持。

Result: 在ACLAward和Laboratory基准测试中，DLMA生成的研究论文在自动评估中获得最先进分数，显著优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: 消融研究证实了两个循环的关键作用：进化驱动新颖性，执行确保合理性，DLMA成功解决了自动化科研的双层挑战。

Abstract: Automating the end-to-end scientific research process poses a fundamental
challenge: it requires both evolving high-level plans that are novel and sound,
and executing these plans correctly amidst dynamic and uncertain conditions. To
address this bilevel challenge, we propose a novel Double-Loop Multi-Agent
(DLMA) framework to solve the given research problem automatically. The leader
loop, composed of professor agents, is responsible for evolving research plans.
It employs an evolutionary algorithm through involvement, improvement, and
integration meetings to iteratively generate and refine a pool of research
proposals, exploring the solution space effectively. The follower loop,
composed of doctoral student agents, is responsible for executing the
best-evolved plan. It dynamically adjusts the plan during implementation via
pre-hoc and post-hoc meetings, ensuring each step (e.g., drafting, coding) is
well-supported by contextual and external observations. Extensive experiments
on benchmarks like ACLAward and Laboratory show that DLMA generates research
papers that achieve state-of-the-art scores in automated evaluation,
significantly outperforming strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm the
critical roles of both loops, with evolution driving novelty and execution
ensuring soundness.

Motivation: 现有形式化模型在生成语法有效和语义一致的正式陈述方面仍有困难，需要改进自动形式化的可靠性。

Method: 结合Lean 4编译器进行语法修正，使用多LLM作为评判者进行一致性验证，通过工具反馈自适应优化生成结果，包含冷启动、专家迭代和直接偏好优化三个阶段。

Conclusion: ATF通过工具反馈机制有效提升了自动形式化的语法有效性和语义一致性，开源数据集Numina-ATF将促进相关研究发展。

Abstract: Autoformalization addresses the scarcity of data for Automated Theorem
Proving (ATP) by translating mathematical problems from natural language into
formal statements. Efforts in recent work shift from directly prompting large
language models to training an end-to-end formalizer model from scratch,
achieving remarkable advancements. However, existing formalizer still struggles
to consistently generate valid statements that meet syntactic validity and
semantic consistency. To address this issue, we propose the Autoformalizer with
Tool Feedback (ATF), a novel approach that incorporates syntactic and
consistency information as tools into the formalization process. By integrating
Lean 4 compilers for syntax corrections and employing a multi-LLMs-as-judge
approach for consistency validation, the model is able to adaptively refine
generated statements according to the tool feedback, enhancing both syntactic
validity and semantic consistency. The training of ATF involves a cold-start
phase on synthetic tool-calling data, an expert iteration phase to improve
formalization capabilities, and Direct Preference Optimization to alleviate
ineffective revisions. Experimental results show that ATF markedly outperforms
a range of baseline formalizer models, with its superior performance further
validated by human evaluations. Subsequent analysis reveals that ATF
demonstrates excellent inference scaling properties. Moreover, we open-source
Numina-ATF, a dataset containing 750K synthetic formal statements to facilitate
advancements in autoformalization and ATP research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有迭代精化方法依赖预定义启发式，难以有效探索巨大的搜索空间，且无法根据过去结果自适应调整策略。

Method: 提出TGPR框架，将GRPO与基于Thompson采样的树搜索相结合，主动探索失败和成功的精化路径，实现更密集的训练轨迹和自适应策略。

Result: 在HumanEval、MBPP和APPS基准测试中，相比GRPO基线，pass@1最高提升4.2个百分点（MBPP），pass@10最高提升12.51个百分点（APPS）。

Conclusion: TGPR为结合学习策略与结构化搜索方法提供了原则性方法，是增强LLM迭代精化和状态推理的通用框架。

Abstract: Iterative refinement has been a promising paradigm to enable large language
models (LLMs) to resolve difficult reasoning and problem-solving tasks. One of
the key challenges, however, is how to effectively search through the enormous
search space of possible refinements. Existing methods typically fall back on
predefined heuristics, which are troubled by the exploration-exploitation
dilemma and cannot adapt based on past refinement outcomes. We introduce
Tree-Guided Policy Refinement (TGPR), a novel framework that combines GRPO with
a Thompson-Sampling-based tree search. TGPR explores both failed and successful
refinement paths actively, with denser training trajectories and more adaptive
policies. On HumanEval, MBPP, and APPS benchmarks, our method achieves up to
+4.2 percentage points absolute improvement in pass@1 (on MBPP) and up to
+12.51 percentage points absolute improvement in pass@10 (on APPS) compared to
a competitive GRPO baseline. Apart from debugging code, TGPR focuses on a
principled approach to combining learned policies with structured search
methods, offering a general framework for enhancing iterative refinement and
stateful reasoning in LLMs.

Method: 开发一个集成开发环境，通过引入大语言模型来辅助智能体工程，降低建模AJAN智能体的技术门槛。

Result: 提出了一个能够克服AJAN智能体建模障碍的开发环境，同时通过大语言模型扩展了AJAN的用户社区。

Conclusion: 该集成开发环境有效解决了AJAN框架中语义Web标准应用的技术障碍，使更多用户能够参与多智能体系统的开发。

Abstract: There are many established semantic Web standards for implementing
multi-agent driven applications. The AJAN framework allows to engineer
multi-agent systems based on these standards. In particular, agent knowledge is
represented in RDF/RDFS and OWL, while agent behavior models are defined with
Behavior Trees and SPARQL to access and manipulate this knowledge. However, the
appropriate definition of RDF/RDFS and SPARQL-based agent behaviors still
remains a major hurdle not only for agent modelers in practice. For example,
dealing with URIs is very error-prone regarding typos and dealing with complex
SPARQL queries in large-scale environments requires a high learning curve. In
this paper, we present an integrated development environment to overcome such
hurdles of modeling AJAN agents and at the same time to extend the user
community for AJAN by the possibility to leverage Large Language Models for
agent engineering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索统一信息密度原则在LLM推理轨迹中的适用性，验证步骤级信息密度均匀性是否反映推理质量。

Method: 提出基于熵的步骤级信息密度度量方法，引入局部和全局均匀性评分，在六个推理基准上进行实验验证。

Result: 步骤级信息密度均匀性显著提升推理准确性（AIME2025上相对基线提升10-32%），正确推理轨迹避免信息密度尖峰，错误轨迹则出现不规则信息爆发。

Conclusion: UID启发的信息密度度量优于其他内部信号，信息密度均匀性可作为构建更可靠推理系统的稳健诊断和选择标准。

Abstract: The Uniform Information Density (UID) hypothesis suggests that effective
communication maintains a stable flow of information. In this work, we revisit
this principle in the context of large language model (LLM) reasoning traces,
asking whether step-level uniformity reflects reasoning quality. To this end,
we propose an entropy-based stepwise information density metric and introduce
two complementary measures of uniformity, local and global uniformity scores.
Across the experiments on six different reasoning benchmarks, we find that
step-level uniformity not only provides a strong theoretical lens but also
yields practical performance benefits; for example, selecting reasoning traces
with more uniform information density at the step-level improves accuracy by
10-32\% relative gains over baselines at AIME2025. Our analysis further reveals
that correct reasoning traces tend to avoid sharp information density spikes,
while incorrect traces exhibit irregular information bursts. These results
demonstrate that UID-inspired information density measures outperform
alternative internal signals as predictors of reasoning quality. Results
highlight the uniformity of the information density as a robust diagnostic and
selection criterion for building more reliable and accurate reasoning systems.

Motivation: 现有语言模型仅依赖直接推理在处理需要最新知识或计算工具（如计算器、代码解释器）的复杂算术运算任务时表现不佳，需要系统性地整合推理与工具调用能力。

Method: 采用改进的动态采样策略优化（DAPO）强化学习范式，专门针对工具调用场景进行适配，使模型能够动态地在复杂推理与按需工具使用（包括搜索API和Python解释器）之间交替进行。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-3B和Qwen2.5-7B模型上的实验表明，TAPO在需要外部知识和数学计算的任务上实现了最先进的性能，比基线方法更高效地使用工具，同时防止了因奖励黑客行为导致的过度调用。

Conclusion: 结合高级推理与工具使用具有显著潜力，能够增强模型在知识密集型和计算密集型任务中的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have popularized test-time
scaling, where models generate additional reasoning tokens before producing
final answers. These approaches have demonstrated significant performance
improvements on benchmarks involving mathematical reasoning. However, language
models relying solely on direct inference still struggle with tasks demanding
up-to-date knowledge or computational tools such as calculators and code
interpreters for complex arithmetic operations. To overcome these limitations,
we propose Tool-Augmented Policy Optimization (TAPO), a novel reinforcement
learning framework that systematically integrates multi-hop reasoning with
adaptive tool-calling capabilities. Our approach employs a modified version of
Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization (DAPO), a recently developed RL paradigm,
which we adapt specifically for tool invocation scenarios, enabling models to
dynamically interleave complex reasoning with on-demand tool usage (including
search APIs and Python interpreters).
  To support this research, we introduce two new datasets: TAPO-easy-60K and
TAPO-hard-18K, specifically designed to train and evaluate both fact-based
reasoning and mathematical calculation capabilities. Our experiments on
Qwen2.5-3B and Qwen2.5-7B models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
with both models achieving state-of-the-art performance on tasks requiring
external knowledge and mathematical computation among methods with comparable
parameters. Notably, TAPO achieves more efficient tool utilization than
baseline methods while preventing excessive calls caused by reward hacking.
These results highlight the significant potential of combining advanced
reasoning with tool usage to enhance model performance in knowledge-intensive
and computationally demanding tasks.

Abstract: The difficulty and expense of obtaining large-scale human responses make
Large Language Models (LLMs) an attractive alternative and a promising proxy
for human behavior. However, prior work shows that LLMs often produce
homogeneous outputs that fail to capture the rich diversity of human
perspectives and behaviors. Thus, rather than trying to capture this diversity
with a single LLM agent, we propose a novel framework to construct a set of
agents that collectively capture the diversity of a given human population.
Each agent is an LLM whose behavior is steered by conditioning on a small set
of human demonstrations (task-response pairs) through in-context learning. The
central challenge is therefore to select a representative set of LLM agents
from the exponentially large space of possible agents. We tackle this selection
problem from the lens of submodular optimization. In particular, we develop
methods that offer different trade-offs regarding time complexity and
performance guarantees. Extensive experiments in crowdsourcing and educational
domains demonstrate that our approach constructs agents that more effectively
represent human populations compared to baselines. Moreover, behavioral
analyses on new tasks show that these agents reproduce the behavior patterns
and perspectives of the students and annotators they are designed to represent.

Abstract: Possibilistic logic programs (poss-programs) under stable models are a major
variant of answer set programming (ASP). While its semantics (possibilistic
stable models) and properties have been well investigated, the problem of
inductive reasoning has not been investigated yet. This paper presents an
approach to extracting poss-programs from a background program and examples
(parts of intended possibilistic stable models). To this end, the notion of
induction tasks is first formally defined, its properties are investigated and
two algorithms ilpsm and ilpsmmin for computing induction solutions are
presented. An implementation of ilpsmmin is also provided and experimental
results show that when inputs are ordinary logic programs, the prototype
outperforms a major inductive learning system for normal logic programs from
stable models on the datasets that are randomly generated.

Abstract: Designing high-performing heuristics for vehicle routing problems (VRPs) is a
complex task that requires both intuition and deep domain knowledge. Large
language model (LLM)-based code generation has recently shown promise across
many domains, but it still falls short of producing heuristics that rival those
crafted by human experts. In this paper, we propose VRPAgent, a framework that
integrates LLM-generated components into a metaheuristic and refines them
through a novel genetic search. By using the LLM to generate problem-specific
operators, embedded within a generic metaheuristic framework, VRPAgent keeps
tasks manageable, guarantees correctness, and still enables the discovery of
novel and powerful strategies. Across multiple problems, including the
capacitated VRP, the VRP with time windows, and the prize-collecting VRP, our
method discovers heuristic operators that outperform handcrafted methods and
recent learning-based approaches while requiring only a single CPU core. To our
knowledge, \VRPAgent is the first LLM-based paradigm to advance the
state-of-the-art in VRPs, highlighting a promising future for automated
heuristics discovery.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了两种动作表示方法在长视野任务中的有效性：基于动作的规划(PwA)和基于模式的规划(PwS)，发现在动作空间规模扩大时存在表示选择拐点，并提出了构建更强大PwS智能体的实用指南。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于动作的规划方法在环境动作空间组合爆炸时（如开放世界）变得不切实际，需要寻找可扩展的最优动作表示方法。

Method: 比较两种动作表示：PwA（提供可执行动作列表）和PwS（将动作模式实例化为动作列表），提出认知带宽视角作为概念框架，在ALFWorld和SciWorld上进行实证研究。

Result: 观察到在ALFWorld（约35个动作）和SciWorld（约500个动作）之间存在表示选择拐点，更强的规划能力使拐点右移，更好的模式实例化使拐点左移。

Conclusion: 需要可扩展的动作表示方法，PwS在动作空间扩大时具有优势，但当前性能不理想，需要改进PwS智能体以实现更好的可扩展自主性。

Abstract: Enabling LLMs to effectively operate long-horizon task which requires
long-term planning and multiple interactions is essential for open-world
autonomy. Conventional methods adopt planning with actions where a executable
action list would be provided as reference. However, this action representation
choice would be impractical when the environment action space is combinatorial
exploded (e.g., open-ended real world). This naturally leads to a question: As
environmental action space scales, what is the optimal action representation
for long-horizon agents? In this paper, we systematically study the
effectiveness of two different action representations. The first one is
conventional planning with actions (PwA) which is predominantly adopted for its
effectiveness on existing benchmarks. The other one is planning with schemas
(PwS) which instantiate an action schema into action lists (e.g., "move [OBJ]
to [OBJ]" -> "move apple to desk") to ensure concise action space and reliable
scalability. This alternative is motivated by its alignment with human
cognition and its compliance with environment-imposed action format
restriction. We propose cognitive bandwidth perspective as a conceptual
framework to qualitatively understand the differences between these two action
representations and empirically observe a representation-choice inflection
point between ALFWorld (~35 actions) and SciWorld (~500 actions), which serve
as evidence of the need for scalable representations. We further conduct
controlled experiments to study how the location of this inflection point
interacts with different model capacities: stronger planning proficiency shifts
the inflection rightward, whereas better schema instantiation shifts it
leftward. Finally, noting the suboptimal performance of PwS agents, we provide
an actionable guide for building more capable PwS agents for better scalable
autonomy.

Conclusion: 物理脆弱性和死亡等存在条件可以转化为驱动智能体学习和适应的内在动力，有助于培养开放性和关怀能力。

Abstract: Physical vulnerability and mortality are often seen as obstacles to be
avoided in the development of artificial agents, which struggle to adapt to
open-ended environments and provide aligned care. Meanwhile, biological
organisms survive, thrive, and care for each other in an open-ended physical
world with relative ease and efficiency. Understanding the role of the
conditions of life in this disparity can aid in developing more robust,
adaptive, and caring artificial agents. Here we define two minimal conditions
for physical embodiment inspired by the existentialist phenomenology of Martin
Heidegger: being-in-the-world (the agent is a part of the environment) and
being-towards-death (unless counteracted, the agent drifts toward terminal
states due to the second law of thermodynamics). We propose that from these
conditions we can obtain both a homeostatic drive - aimed at maintaining
integrity and avoiding death by expending energy to learn and act - and an
intrinsic drive to continue to do so in as many ways as possible. Drawing
inspiration from Friedrich Nietzsche's existentialist concept of will-to-power,
we examine how intrinsic drives to maximize control over future states, e.g.,
empowerment, allow agents to increase the probability that they will be able to
meet their future homeostatic needs, thereby enhancing their capacity to
maintain physical integrity. We formalize these concepts within a reinforcement
learning framework, which enables us to examine how intrinsically driven
embodied agents learning in open-ended multi-agent environments may cultivate
the capacities for open-endedness and care.ov

Abstract: Process discovery aims to derive process models from event logs, providing
insights into operational behavior and forming a foundation for conformance
checking and process improvement. However, models derived solely from event
data may not accurately reflect the real process, as event logs are often
incomplete or affected by noise, and domain knowledge, an important
complementary resource, is typically disregarded. As a result, the discovered
models may lack reliability for downstream tasks. We propose an interactive
framework that incorporates domain knowledge, expressed in natural language,
into the process discovery pipeline using Large Language Models (LLMs). Our
approach leverages LLMs to extract declarative rules from textual descriptions
provided by domain experts. These rules are used to guide the IMr discovery
algorithm, which recursively constructs process models by combining insights
from both the event log and the extracted rules, helping to avoid problematic
process structures that contradict domain knowledge. The framework coordinates
interactions among the LLM, domain experts, and a set of backend services. We
present a fully implemented tool that supports this workflow and conduct an
extensive evaluation of multiple LLMs and prompt engineering strategies. Our
empirical study includes a case study based on a real-life event log with the
involvement of domain experts, who assessed the usability and effectiveness of
the framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试存在方法学三难困境：必须在科学相关性、可扩展性和抗记忆化之间进行权衡，并且过度简化发现过程为静态函数拟合，未能捕捉真实的科学探索过程。

Method: 使用形而上学变换（对规范定律的系统性修改）来生成大量问题，要求智能体通过实验探索模拟复杂系统来发现隐藏原理，实现交互式模型发现。

Result: 前沿大语言模型显示出清晰但脆弱的发现能力：随着系统复杂性增加，该能力急剧下降，并对观测噪声极其敏感。工具辅助存在悖论效应：提供代码解释器可能阻碍更有能力的模型，导致过早从探索转向利用。

Conclusion: 在复杂交互环境中实现稳健、可泛化的发现仍然是核心挑战。NewtonBench为衡量真实进展和指导下一代AI智能体的开发提供了关键工具。

Abstract: Large language models are emerging as powerful tools for scientific law
discovery, a foundational challenge in AI-driven science. However, existing
benchmarks for this task suffer from a fundamental methodological trilemma,
forcing a trade-off between scientific relevance, scalability, and resistance
to memorization. Furthermore, they oversimplify discovery as static function
fitting, failing to capture the authentic scientific process of uncovering
embedded laws through the interactive exploration of complex model systems. To
address these critical gaps, we introduce NewtonBench, a benchmark comprising
324 scientific law discovery tasks across 12 physics domains. Our design
mitigates the evaluation trilemma by using metaphysical shifts - systematic
alterations of canonical laws - to generate a vast suite of problems that are
scalable, scientifically relevant, and memorization-resistant. Moreover, we
elevate the evaluation from static function fitting to interactive model
discovery, requiring agents to experimentally probe simulated complex systems
to uncover hidden principles. Our extensive experiment reveals a clear but
fragile capability for discovery in frontier LLMs: this ability degrades
precipitously with increasing system complexity and exhibits extreme
sensitivity to observational noise. Notably, we uncover a paradoxical effect of
tool assistance: providing a code interpreter can hinder more capable models by
inducing a premature shift from exploration to exploitation, causing them to
satisfice on suboptimal solutions. These results demonstrate that robust,
generalizable discovery in complex, interactive environments remains the core
challenge. By providing a scalable, robust, and scientifically authentic
testbed, NewtonBench offers a crucial tool for measuring true progress and
guiding the development of next-generation AI agents capable of genuine
scientific discovery.

Conclusion: 生成式AI工作流成功解决了媒体内容发现的效率问题，让用户能够专注于创意内容制作和故事线开发。

Abstract: Generative AI has unlocked new possibilities in content discovery and
management. Through collaboration with the National Football League (NFL), we
demonstrate how a generative-AI based workflow enables media researchers and
analysts to query relevant historical plays using natural language rather than
traditional filter-and-click interfaces. The agentic workflow takes a user
query as input, breaks it into elements, and translates them into the
underlying database query language. Accuracy and latency are further improved
through carefully designed semantic caching. The solution achieves over 95
percent accuracy and reduces the average time to find relevant videos from 10
minutes to 30 seconds, significantly increasing the NFL's operational
efficiency and allowing users to focus on producing creative content and
engaging storylines.
