Because the fundamental frequency (F0), a\nphysical correlate of pitch, is one of the essential features of speech, there\nhas been particular interest in characterizing the FFR at F0, especially when\nF0 varies over time. The standard method for extracting F0 in FFRs has been the\nAutocorrelation Function (ACF). This paper investigates\nharmonic-structure-based F0 estimation algorithms, originally developed for\nspeech and music, and resolves their poor performance when applied to FFRs in\ntwo steps. Firstly, given that unlike in speech or music, stimulus F0 of FFRs\nis already known, we introduce a stimulus-aware filterbank that selectively\naggregates amplitudes at F0 and its harmonics while suppressing noise at\nnon-harmonic frequencies. This method, called Harmonic Amplitude Summation\n(HAS), evaluates F0 candidates only within a range centered around the stimulus\nF0. Secondly, unlike other pitch tracking methods that select the highest peak,\nour method chooses the most prominent one, as it better reflects the underlying\nperiodicity of FFRs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to\npropose an F0 estimation algorithm for FFRs that relies on harmonic structure.\nAnalyzing recorded FFRs from 16 normal hearing subjects to 4 natural speech\nstimuli with a wide F0 variation from 89 Hz to 452 Hz showed that this method\noutperformed ACF by reducing the average Root-Mean-Square-Error (RMSE) within\neach response and stimulus F0 contour pair by 8.8% to 47.4%, depending on the\nstimulus.", "AI": {"tldr": "本文提出了一种基于谐波结构的F0估计算法（HAS），用于改进FFR中F0提取的性能，通过刺激感知滤波器组和选择最显著峰值的方法，显著降低了RMSE。", "motivation": "由于FFR中F0的提取对语音处理至关重要，而传统方法（如ACF）在FFR中表现不佳，因此需要开发一种更有效的方法。", "method": "引入刺激感知滤波器组（HAS），选择性聚合F0及其谐波的振幅，并在刺激F0附近范围内评估候选F0；选择最显著峰值而非最高峰值。", "result": "在16名听力正常受试者的FFR数据中，HAS方法将RMSE降低了8.8%至47.4%，优于ACF。", "conclusion": "HAS是首个基于谐波结构的FFR F0估计算法，显著提升了性能，为FFR分析提供了新工具。"}}

However, existing approaches predominantly integrate formalin-fixed\nparaffin-embedded (FFPE) slides with genomic data, while neglecting the\navailability of other preservation slides, such as Fresh Froze (FF) slides.\nMoreover, as the high-resolution spatial nature of pathology data tends to\ndominate the cross-modality fusion process, it hinders effective multimodal\nfusion and leads to modality imbalance challenges between pathology and\ngenomics. These methods also typically require complete data modalities,\nlimiting their clinical applicability with incomplete modalities, such as\nmissing either pathology or genomic data. In this paper, we propose a\nmultimodal survival prediction framework that leverages hypergraph learning to\neffectively integrate multi-WSI information and cross-modality interactions\nbetween pathology slides and genomics data while addressing modality imbalance.\nIn addition, we introduce a memory mechanism that stores previously learned\npaired pathology-genomic features and dynamically compensates for incomplete\nmodalities. Experiments on five TCGA datasets demonstrate that our model\noutperforms advanced methods by over 2.3% in C-Index. Under incomplete modality\nscenarios, our approach surpasses pathology-only (3.3%) and gene-only models\n(7.9%).
