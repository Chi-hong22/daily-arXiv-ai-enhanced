Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个多模态数据集，用于开发和评估基于可穿戴IMU的运动分类模型，支持物理治疗和步态分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发基于IMU的运动分类模型需要大量多样化的数据，但收集成本高且耗时，因此作者提供了包含正确和临床相关变体的数据集。

Method: 数据集包括19名参与者的同步IMU和标记运动捕捉数据，提供原始和处理后的数据、OpenSim模型、逆向运动学结果及可视化工具。

Result: 数据集支持机器学习模型的开发和基准测试，如自动运动评估、步态分析、时间活动分割和生物力学参数估计。

Conclusion: 该资源旨在加速机器学习驱动的人类运动分析研究，并提供了代码以确保可重复性。

Abstract: Wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) offer a cost-effective and
scalable means to assess human movement quality in clinical and everyday
settings. However, the development of robust sensor-based classification models
for physiotherapeutic exercises and gait analysis requires large, diverse
datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to collect. Here, we present a
multimodal dataset of physiotherapeutic exercises - including correct and
clinically relevant variants - and gait-related exercises - including both
normal and impaired gait patterns - recorded from 19 participants using
synchronized IMUs and marker-based motion capture (MoCap). The dataset includes
raw data from nine IMUs and thirty-five optical markers capturing full-body
kinematics. Each IMU is additionally equipped with four optical markers,
enabling precise comparison between IMU-derived orientation estimates and
reference values from the MoCap system. To support further analysis, we also
provide processed IMU orientations aligned with common segment coordinate
systems, subject-specific OpenSim models, inverse kinematics results, and tools
for visualizing IMU orientations in the musculoskeletal context. Detailed
annotations of movement execution quality and time-stamped segmentations
support diverse analysis goals. This dataset supports the development and
benchmarking of machine learning models for tasks such as automatic exercise
evaluation, gait analysis, temporal activity segmentation, and biomechanical
parameter estimation. To facilitate reproducibility, we provide code for
postprocessing, sensor-to-segment alignment, inverse kinematics computation,
and technical validation. This resource is intended to accelerate research in
machine learning-driven human movement analysis.

### [2] [Seeing Beyond Frames: Zero-Shot Pedestrian Intention Prediction with Raw Temporal Video and Multimodal Cues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21161)
*Pallavi Zambare,Venkata Nikhil Thanikella,Ying Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BF-PIP是一种零样本方法，通过连续视频片段和结构化元数据预测行人意图，优于基于离散帧的GPT-4V方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂城市环境中，行人意图预测对自动驾驶至关重要，传统方法需要大量重新训练。

Method: BF-PIP利用Gemini 2.5 Pro处理连续视频片段，结合JAAD元数据、边界框标注和车辆速度。

Result: 无需额外训练，BF-PIP预测准确率达73%，比GPT-4V基线高18%。

Conclusion: 结合时间视频输入和上下文线索可提升时空感知，为智能交通系统提供无需重新训练的敏捷感知模块。

Abstract: Pedestrian intention prediction is essential for autonomous driving in
complex urban environments. Conventional approaches depend on supervised
learning over frame sequences and require extensive retraining to adapt to new
scenarios. Here, we introduce BF-PIP (Beyond Frames Pedestrian Intention
Prediction), a zero-shot approach built upon Gemini 2.5 Pro. It infers crossing
intentions directly from short, continuous video clips enriched with structured
JAAD metadata. In contrast to GPT-4V based methods that operate on discrete
frames, BF-PIP processes uninterrupted temporal clips. It also incorporates
bounding-box annotations and ego-vehicle speed via specialized multimodal
prompts. Without any additional training, BF-PIP achieves 73% prediction
accuracy, outperforming a GPT-4V baseline by 18 %. These findings illustrate
that combining temporal video inputs with contextual cues enhances
spatiotemporal perception and improves intent inference under ambiguous
conditions. This approach paves the way for agile, retraining-free perception
module in intelligent transportation system.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多模态图表编辑新范式，结合自然语言和视觉指示器表达用户意图，并发布了ChartM3基准数据集和训练集ChartM3-Train，显著提升了多模态大语言模型的图表编辑能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图表编辑方法主要依赖自然语言指令，但语言模糊性限制了细粒度编辑。

Method: 引入多模态编辑范式，结合自然语言和视觉指示器；构建ChartM3基准数据集和ChartM3-Train训练集。

Result: 当前MLLMs（如GPT-4o）在视觉指示器理解和执行上表现有限，但通过ChartM3-Train微调后性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 多模态监督对实用图表编辑系统至关重要，ChartM3为未来研究提供了数据和工具支持。

Abstract: Charts are a fundamental visualization format widely used in data analysis
across research and industry. While enabling users to edit charts based on
high-level intentions is of great practical value, existing methods primarily
rely on natural language instructions, which are often too ambiguous to support
fine-grained editing. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for
multimodal chart editing, where user intent is expressed through a combination
of natural language and visual indicators that explicitly highlight the
elements to be modified. To support this paradigm, we present
Chart$\text{M}^3$, a new benchmark for Multimodal chart editing with
Multi-level complexity and Multi-perspective evaluation. Chart$\text{M}^3$
contains 1,000 samples spanning four levels of editing difficulty. Each sample
includes triplets in the form of (chart, code, multimodal instructions). To
comprehensively evaluate chart editing models, Chart$\text{M}^3$ provides
metrics that assess both visual appearance and code correctness. Our benchmark
reveals significant limitations in current multimodal large language models
(MLLMs), including GPT-4o, particularly in their ability to interpret and act
on visual indicators. To address this, we construct Chart$\text{M}^3$-Train, a
large-scale training set with 24,000 multimodal chart editing samples.
Fine-tuning MLLMs on this dataset leads to substantial improvements,
demonstrating the importance of multimodal supervision in building practical
chart editing systems. Our datasets, codes, and evaluation tools are available

### [4] [VoluMe -- Authentic 3D Video Calls from Live Gaussian Splat Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21311)
*Martin de La Gorce,Charlie Hewitt,Tibor Takacs,Robert Gerdisch,Zafiirah Hosenie,Givi Meishvili,Marek Kowalski,Thomas J. Cashman,Antonio Criminisi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种从单目2D摄像头实时生成高质量3D高斯重建的方法，适用于3D视频会议，具有真实性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有3D会议中人物表示的高硬件依赖和固定外观限制问题，提升远程会议的临场感和参与度。

Method: 通过独立处理每帧视频，结合稳定性损失函数，实时预测3D高斯重建，确保真实性和时间稳定性。

Result: 在视觉质量和稳定性指标上达到领先水平，仅需普通2D摄像头即可实现高质量的3D会议。

Conclusion: 该方法为3D视频会议提供了一种高可访问性、真实且自然的解决方案。

Abstract: Virtual 3D meetings offer the potential to enhance copresence, increase
engagement and thus improve effectiveness of remote meetings compared to
standard 2D video calls. However, representing people in 3D meetings remains a
challenge; existing solutions achieve high quality by using complex hardware,
making use of fixed appearance via enrolment, or by inverting a pre-trained
generative model. These approaches lead to constraints that are unwelcome and
ill-fitting for videoconferencing applications. We present the first method to
predict 3D Gaussian reconstructions in real time from a single 2D webcam feed,
where the 3D representation is not only live and realistic, but also authentic
to the input video. By conditioning the 3D representation on each video frame
independently, our reconstruction faithfully recreates the input video from the
captured viewpoint (a property we call authenticity), while generalizing
realistically to novel viewpoints. Additionally, we introduce a stability loss
to obtain reconstructions that are temporally stable on video sequences. We
show that our method delivers state-of-the-art accuracy in visual quality and
stability metrics compared to existing methods, and demonstrate our approach in
live one-to-one 3D meetings using only a standard 2D camera and display. This
demonstrates that our approach can allow anyone to communicate volumetrically,
via a method for 3D videoconferencing that is not only highly accessible, but
also realistic and authentic.

### [5] [PanoGAN A Deep Generative Model for Panoramic Dental Radiographs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21200)
*Soren Pedersen,Sanyam Jain,Mikkel Chavez,Viktor Ladehoff,Bruna Neves de Freitas,Ruben Pauwels*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文开发了一种用于合成牙科全景X光片的生成对抗网络（GAN），旨在解决牙科研究和教育中数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决牙科研究和教育中数据稀缺的问题。

Method: 使用Wasserstein损失和梯度惩罚（WGANGP）训练深度卷积GAN（DCGAN），对2322张质量不一的X光片进行预处理和训练。

Result: 生成的X光片在解剖可见性和真实性上表现中等，部分图像存在伪影。未去噪数据训练的模型在细节表现上更优，而去噪数据训练的模型整体清晰度更高。

Conclusion: 为未来基于GAN的牙科影像方法提供了基础。

Abstract: This paper presents the development of a generative adversarial network (GAN)
for synthesizing dental panoramic radiographs. Although exploratory in nature,
the study aims to address the scarcity of data in dental research and
education. We trained a deep convolutional GAN (DCGAN) using a Wasserstein loss
with gradient penalty (WGANGP) on a dataset of 2322 radiographs of varying
quality. The focus was on the dentoalveolar regions, other anatomical
structures were cropped out. Extensive preprocessing and data cleaning were
performed to standardize the inputs while preserving anatomical variability. We
explored four candidate models by varying critic iterations, feature depth, and
the use of denoising prior to training. A clinical expert evaluated the
generated radiographs based on anatomical visibility and realism, using a
5-point scale (1 very poor 5 excellent). Most images showed moderate anatomical
depiction, although some were degraded by artifacts. A trade-off was observed
the model trained on non-denoised data yielded finer details especially in
structures like the mandibular canal and trabecular bone, while a model trained
on denoised data offered superior overall image clarity and sharpness. These
findings provide a foundation for future work on GAN-based methods in dental
imaging.

### [6] [On Explaining Visual Captioning with Hybrid Markov Logic Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21246)
*Monika Shah,Somdeb Sarkhel,Deepak Venugopal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于混合马尔可夫逻辑网络（HMLNs）的解释框架，用于解释深度神经网络在多模态任务（如图像描述生成）中的决策过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管DNN在多模态任务中表现优异，但其如何整合视觉、语言和知识表示以生成有意义的描述仍缺乏可解释性。

Method: 通过HMLNs结合符号规则和实值函数，量化训练数据对生成描述的影响。

Result: 实验表明，该框架能提供可解释的解释，并比较不同模型的可解释性。

Conclusion: 该框架为DNN的多模态任务提供了一种新的解释方法，增强了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have made tremendous progress in multimodal tasks
such as image captioning. However, explaining/interpreting how these models
integrate visual information, language information and knowledge representation
to generate meaningful captions remains a challenging problem. Standard metrics
to measure performance typically rely on comparing generated captions with
human-written ones that may not provide a user with a deep insights into this
integration. In this work, we develop a novel explanation framework that is
easily interpretable based on Hybrid Markov Logic Networks (HMLNs) - a language
that can combine symbolic rules with real-valued functions - where we
hypothesize how relevant examples from the training data could have influenced
the generation of the observed caption. To do this, we learn a HMLN
distribution over the training instances and infer the shift in distributions
over these instances when we condition on the generated sample which allows us
to quantify which examples may have been a source of richer information to
generate the observed caption. Our experiments on captions generated for
several state-of-the-art captioning models using Amazon Mechanical Turk
illustrate the interpretability of our explanations, and allow us to compare
these models along the dimension of explainability.

### [7] [Dual Guidance Semi-Supervised Action Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21247)
*Ankit Singh,Efstratios Gavves,Cees G. M. Snoek,Hilde Kuehne*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于时空动作定位的半监督学习方法，通过双引导网络选择更好的伪边界框，显著提升了有限标注数据下的模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半监督学习在图像分类中已有广泛应用，但在时空动作定位领域的研究较少，因此探索其在该领域的潜力。

Method: 引入双引导网络，结合帧级分类和边界框预测，确保动作类别在帧和边界框之间的一致性。

Result: 在UCF101-24、J-HMDB-21和AVA数据集上评估，模型在有限标注数据下表现优异，优于基于图像的半监督基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为时空动作定位提供了一种有效的半监督解决方案，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) has shown tremendous potential to improve the
predictive performance of deep learning models when annotations are hard to
obtain. However, the application of SSL has so far been mainly studied in the
context of image classification. In this work, we present a semi-supervised
approach for spatial-temporal action localization. We introduce a dual guidance
network to select better pseudo-bounding boxes. It combines a frame-level
classification with a bounding-box prediction to enforce action class
consistency across frames and boxes. Our evaluation across well-known
spatial-temporal action localization datasets, namely UCF101-24 , J-HMDB-21 and
AVA shows that the proposed module considerably enhances the model's
performance in limited labeled data settings. Our framework achieves superior
results compared to extended image-based semi-supervised baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究了航空野生动物追踪中的小目标检测问题，通过数据增强和比较不同目标检测模型，发现简单快速的模型在有限计算资源下表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 航空野生动物追踪面临高成本、高风险和技术挑战，尤其是小目标检测在计算资源受限的无人机上难以实现。

Method: 采用数据增强（分块增强）方法，比较三种不同架构的目标检测模型，并分析分块参数对检测精度的影响。

Result: 所有模型在至少一种分块配置下达到93%以上的mAP@IoU=0.5，统计分析了不同因素的影响。

Conclusion: 简单快速的模型在有限计算资源下表现优异，适合无人机部署，数据集和模型已开源。

Abstract: Aerial wildlife tracking is critical for conservation efforts and relies on
detecting small objects on the ground below the aircraft. It presents technical
challenges: crewed aircraft are expensive, risky and disruptive; autonomous
drones have limited computational capacity for onboard AI systems. Since the
objects of interest may appear only a few pixels wide, small object detection
is an inherently challenging computer vision subfield compounded by
computational efficiency needs. This paper applies a patching augmentation to
datasets to study model performance under various settings. A comparative study
of three common yet architecturally diverse object detectors is conducted using
the data, varying the patching method's hyperparameters against detection
accuracy. Each model achieved at least 93\% mAP@IoU=0.5 on at least one
patching configuration. Statistical analyses provide an in-depth commentary on
the effects of various factors. Analysis also shows that faster, simpler models
are about as effective as models that require more computational power for this
task and perform well given limited patch scales, encouraging UAV deployment.

### [9] [HDR Environment Map Estimation with Latent Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21261)
*Jack Hilliard,Adrian Hilton,Jean-Yves Guillemaut*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于潜在扩散模型（LDM）的新方法，用于从单视图图像估计HDR环境贴图，解决了ERP表示中的边界伪影问题，并提出了全景适应的扩散变换器架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ERP格式环境贴图中常见的极区失真和边界伪影问题，提升单视图图像估计HDR环境贴图的质量和准确性。

Method: 1. 使用潜在扩散模型（LDM）生成高质量环境贴图；2. 提出ERP卷积填充消除边界伪影；3. 设计全景适应的扩散变换器架构（PanoDiT）以减少ERP失真。

Result: 模型在标准基准测试中表现优异，生成的环境贴图在图像质量和光照准确性上与最先进方法竞争。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了ERP格式的伪影问题，但全景适应架构在提升准确性的同时牺牲了部分图像质量。

Abstract: We advance the field of HDR environment map estimation from a single-view
image by establishing a novel approach leveraging the Latent Diffusion Model
(LDM) to produce high-quality environment maps that can plausibly light
mirror-reflective surfaces. A common issue when using the ERP representation,
the format used by the vast majority of approaches, is distortions at the poles
and a seam at the sides of the environment map. We remove the border seam
artefact by proposing an ERP convolutional padding in the latent autoencoder.
Additionally, we investigate whether adapting the diffusion network
architecture to the ERP format can improve the quality and accuracy of the
estimated environment map by proposing a panoramically-adapted Diffusion
Transformer architecture. Our proposed PanoDiT network reduces ERP distortions
and artefacts, but at the cost of image quality and plausibility. We evaluate
with standard benchmarks to demonstrate that our models estimate high-quality
environment maps that perform competitively with state-of-the-art approaches in
both image quality and lighting accuracy.

### [10] [Fairness and Robustness of CLIP-Based Models for Chest X-rays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21291)
*Théo Sourget,David Restrepo,Céline Hudelot,Enzo Ferrante,Stergios Christodoulidis,Maria Vakalopoulou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究评估了六种基于CLIP的模型在胸部X光分类任务中的公平性和鲁棒性，发现模型在不同年龄组间存在性能差距，但对其他属性表现较公平；同时揭示了模型对虚假相关性的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型在自然图像-文本领域表现优异，但其在医学任务（如放射学）中的公平性和鲁棒性尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用三个公开数据集（MIMIC-CXR、NIH-CXR14、NEATX）评估六种CLIP模型，分析其在不同患者亚组（年龄、性别、种族）中的公平性，并测试对虚假相关性的鲁棒性。

Result: 模型在不同年龄组间性能差异显著，但对性别和种族表现较公平；所有模型在无胸引流的病例中表现较差，表明依赖虚假相关性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了CLIP模型在医学任务中的公平性和鲁棒性问题，强调了进一步优化和评估的必要性。

Abstract: Motivated by the strong performance of CLIP-based models in natural
image-text domains, recent efforts have adapted these architectures to medical
tasks, particularly in radiology, where large paired datasets of images and
reports, such as chest X-rays, are available. While these models have shown
encouraging results in terms of accuracy and discriminative performance, their
fairness and robustness in the different clinical tasks remain largely
underexplored. In this study, we extensively evaluate six widely used
CLIP-based models on chest X-ray classification using three publicly available
datasets: MIMIC-CXR, NIH-CXR14, and NEATX. We assess the models fairness across
six conditions and patient subgroups based on age, sex, and race. Additionally,
we assess the robustness to shortcut learning by evaluating performance on
pneumothorax cases with and without chest drains. Our results indicate
performance gaps between patients of different ages, but more equitable results
for the other attributes. Moreover, all models exhibit lower performance on
images without chest drains, suggesting reliance on spurious correlations. We
further complement the performance analysis with a study of the embeddings
generated by the models. While the sensitive attributes could be classified
from the embeddings, we do not see such patterns using PCA, showing the
limitations of these visualisation techniques when assessing models. Our code
is available at https://github.com/TheoSourget/clip_cxr_fairness

*Feixiang Zhou,Zhuangzhi Gao,He Zhao,Jianyang Xie,Yanda Meng,Yitian Zhao,Gregory Y. H. Lip,Yalin Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种全局到局部连通性保持（GLCP）框架，用于解决管状结构分割中的结构断裂问题，通过联合学习全局分割、骨架图和局部不连续图，显著提升了分割精度和连续性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 管状结构（如血管网络）的准确分割在医学领域至关重要，但现有方法常忽视局部不连续区域，导致分割结果不理想。

Method: 提出GLCP框架，包含交互式多头分割（IMS）模块和基于双注意力的轻量级细化（DAR）模块，以同时感知全局和局部结构特征。

Result: 在2D和3D数据集上的实验表明，GLCP在分割精度和连续性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GLCP框架有效解决了管状结构分割中的局部不连续问题，为医学图像分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of tubular structures, such as vascular networks, plays
a critical role in various medical domains. A remaining significant challenge
in this task is structural fragmentation, which can adversely impact downstream
applications. Existing methods primarily focus on designing various loss
functions to constrain global topological structures. However, they often
overlook local discontinuity regions, leading to suboptimal segmentation
results. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Global-to-Local
Connectivity Preservation (GLCP) framework that can simultaneously perceive
global and local structural characteristics of tubular networks. Specifically,
we propose an Interactive Multi-head Segmentation (IMS) module to jointly learn
global segmentation, skeleton maps, and local discontinuity maps, respectively.
This enables our model to explicitly target local discontinuity regions while
maintaining global topological integrity. In addition, we design a lightweight
Dual-Attention-based Refinement (DAR) module to further improve segmentation
quality by refining the resulting segmentation maps. Extensive experiments on
both 2D and 3D datasets demonstrate that our GLCP achieves superior accuracy
and continuity in tubular structure segmentation compared to several
state-of-the-art approaches. The source codes will be available at

TL;DR: 研究探讨了视觉语言模型（VLMs）在违反Grice对话原则时的表现，发现其性能随修饰词增加而下降。


<details>

Motivation: 探索VLMs是否像人类一样能处理违反Grice对话原则的情况。

Method: 在VQA v2.0数据集上，对GPT-4o、Claude-3.5-Sonnet和Gemini-1.5-Flash三种VLMs添加修饰词并分析其响应。

Result: VLMs的性能随修饰词增加而下降，表明其在处理违反对话原则时存在局限。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于理解VLMs的局限性，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: We can think of Visual Question Answering as a (multimodal) conversation
between a human and an AI system. Here, we explore the sensitivity of Vision
Language Models (VLMs) through the lens of cooperative principles of
conversation proposed by Grice. Specifically, even when Grice's maxims of
conversation are flouted, humans typically do not have much difficulty in
understanding the conversation even though it requires more cognitive effort.
Here, we study if VLMs are capable of handling violations to Grice's maxims in
a manner that is similar to humans. Specifically, we add modifiers to
human-crafted questions and analyze the response of VLMs to these modifiers. We
use three state-of-the-art VLMs in our study, namely, GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet
and Gemini-1.5-Flash on questions from the VQA v2.0 dataset. Our initial
results seem to indicate that the performance of VLMs consistently diminish
with the addition of modifiers which indicates our approach as a promising
direction to understand the limitations of VLMs.

Result: 在纵向数据集上验证，定量指标优于现有方法，下游任务（如脑分割）精度提升。

Conclusion: 方法显著减少重建时间，适合实时临床应用，代码已开源。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a crucial medical imaging modality.
However, long acquisition times remain a significant challenge, leading to
increased costs, and reduced patient comfort. Recent studies have shown the
potential of using deep learning models that incorporate information from prior
subject-specific MRI scans to improve reconstruction quality of present scans.
Integrating this prior information requires registration of the previous scan
to the current image reconstruction, which can be time-consuming. We propose a
novel deep-learning-based MRI reconstruction framework which consists of an
initial reconstruction network, a deep registration model, and a
transformer-based enhancement network. We validated our method on a
longitudinal dataset of T1-weighted MRI scans with 2,808 images from 18
subjects at four acceleration factors (R5, R10, R15, R20). Quantitative metrics
confirmed our approach's superiority over existing methods (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon
signed-rank test). Furthermore, we analyzed the impact of our MRI
reconstruction method on the downstream task of brain segmentation and observed
improved accuracy and volumetric agreement with reference segmentations. Our
approach also achieved a substantial reduction in total reconstruction time
compared to methods that use traditional registration algorithms, making it
more suitable for real-time clinical applications. The code associated with
this work is publicly available at

Result: 在复杂多标签、多人动作检测数据集（AVA、MOMA）上表现出色，mAP性能强，数据效率高。

Conclusion: 该方法能高效适应少样本动作检测任务，提升模型性能和数据效率。

Abstract: Adapting large Video-Language Models (VLMs) for action detection using only a
few examples poses challenges like overfitting and the granularity mismatch
between scene-level pre-training and required person-centric understanding. We
propose an efficient adaptation strategy combining parameter-efficient tuning
(LoRA) with a novel learnable internal feature augmentation. Applied within the
frozen VLM backbone using FiLM, these augmentations generate diverse feature
variations directly relevant to the task. Additionally, we introduce a
group-weighted loss function that dynamically modulates the training
contribution of each augmented sample based on its prediction divergence
relative to the group average. This promotes robust learning by prioritizing
informative yet reasonable augmentations. We demonstrate our method's
effectiveness on complex multi-label, multi-person action detection datasets
(AVA, MOMA), achieving strong mAP performance and showcasing significant data
efficiency for adapting VLMs from limited examples.

Abstract: Vision-based bird's-eye-view (BEV) 3D object detection has advanced
significantly in autonomous driving by offering cost-effectiveness and rich
contextual information. However, existing methods often construct BEV
representations by collapsing extracted object features, neglecting intrinsic
environmental contexts, such as roads and pavements. This hinders detectors
from comprehensively perceiving the characteristics of the physical world. To
alleviate this, we introduce a multi-task learning framework, Collaborative
Perceiver (CoP), that leverages spatial occupancy as auxiliary information to
mine consistent structural and conceptual similarities shared between 3D object
detection and occupancy prediction tasks, bridging gaps in spatial
representations and feature refinement. To this end, we first propose a
pipeline to generate dense occupancy ground truths incorporating local density
information (LDO) for reconstructing detailed environmental information. Next,
we employ a voxel-height-guided sampling (VHS) strategy to distill fine-grained
local features according to distinct object properties. Furthermore, we develop
a global-local collaborative feature fusion (CFF) module that seamlessly
integrates complementary knowledge between both tasks, thus composing more
robust BEV representations. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark
demonstrate that CoP outperforms existing vision-based frameworks, achieving
49.5\% mAP and 59.2\% NDS on the test set. Code and supplementary materials are

Abstract: Wildlife populations in Africa face severe threats, with vertebrate numbers
declining by over 65% in the past five decades. In response, image
classification using deep learning has emerged as a promising tool for
biodiversity monitoring and conservation. This paper presents a comparative
study of deep learning models for automatically classifying African wildlife
images, focusing on transfer learning with frozen feature extractors. Using a
public dataset of four species: buffalo, elephant, rhinoceros, and zebra; we
evaluate the performance of DenseNet-201, ResNet-152, EfficientNet-B4, and
Vision Transformer ViT-H/14. DenseNet-201 achieved the best performance among
convolutional networks (67% accuracy), while ViT-H/14 achieved the highest
overall accuracy (99%), but with significantly higher computational cost,
raising deployment concerns. Our experiments highlight the trade-offs between
accuracy, resource requirements, and deployability. The best-performing CNN
(DenseNet-201) was integrated into a Hugging Face Gradio Space for real-time
field use, demonstrating the feasibility of deploying lightweight models in
conservation settings. This work contributes to African-grounded AI research by
offering practical insights into model selection, dataset preparation, and
responsible deployment of deep learning tools for wildlife conservation.

TL;DR: PDAF是一个概率扩散对齐框架，通过潜在域先验（LDP）建模和扩散过程，提升语义分割模型在未见域中的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决域广义语义分割（DGSS）中因域偏移导致的模型性能下降问题，现有方法忽略潜在域先验，导致效果不佳。

Method: 提出PDAF框架，包含潜在先验提取器（LPE）、域补偿模块（DCM）和扩散先验估计器（DPE），通过扩散过程建模LDP并调整特征表示。

Result: 在多样化的城市场景中验证了PDAF的有效性，显著提升了模型泛化能力。

Conclusion: PDAF通过概率扩散建模和域先验对齐，显著提升了语义分割模型在未见域中的性能。

Abstract: Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) is a critical yet challenging
task, as domain shifts in unseen environments can severely compromise model
performance. While recent studies enhance feature alignment by projecting
features into the source domain, they often neglect intrinsic latent domain
priors, leading to suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce PDAF, a
Probabilistic Diffusion Alignment Framework that enhances the generalization of
existing segmentation networks through probabilistic diffusion modeling. PDAF
introduces a Latent Domain Prior (LDP) to capture domain shifts and uses this
prior as a conditioning factor to align both source and unseen target domains.
To achieve this, PDAF integrates into a pre-trained segmentation model and
utilizes paired source and pseudo-target images to simulate latent domain
shifts, enabling LDP modeling. The framework comprises three modules: the
Latent Prior Extractor (LPE) predicts the LDP by supervising domain shifts; the
Domain Compensation Module (DCM) adjusts feature representations to mitigate
domain shifts; and the Diffusion Prior Estimator (DPE) leverages a diffusion
process to estimate the LDP without requiring paired samples. This design
enables PDAF to iteratively model domain shifts, progressively refining feature
representations to enhance generalization under complex target conditions.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of PDAF across diverse and
challenging urban scenes.

Motivation: 从2D俯视图生成360度室内全景图在虚拟现实、室内设计等领域有广泛应用，但缺乏显式3D结构和几何一致性是主要挑战。

Method: Top2Pano通过估计体积占用推断3D结构，使用体积渲染生成粗糙的全景图，再通过ControlNet进行扩散细化。

Result: 在两个数据集上的评估表明，Top2Pano优于基线方法，能有效重建几何、遮挡和空间布局，并能泛化到示意图。

Conclusion: Top2Pano在连接俯视图与沉浸式室内合成方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Generating immersive 360{\deg} indoor panoramas from 2D top-down views has
applications in virtual reality, interior design, real estate, and robotics.
This task is challenging due to the lack of explicit 3D structure and the need
for geometric consistency and photorealism. We propose Top2Pano, an end-to-end
model for synthesizing realistic indoor panoramas from top-down views. Our
method estimates volumetric occupancy to infer 3D structures, then uses
volumetric rendering to generate coarse color and depth panoramas. These guide
a diffusion-based refinement stage using ControlNet, enhancing realism and
structural fidelity. Evaluations on two datasets show Top2Pano outperforms
baselines, effectively reconstructing geometry, occlusions, and spatial
arrangements. It also generalizes well, producing high-quality panoramas from
schematic floorplans. Our results highlight Top2Pano's potential in bridging
top-down views with immersive indoor synthesis.

TL;DR: LLaVA-Reward是一种高效的奖励模型，利用预训练的多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）自动评估文本到图像（T2I）生成的多个方面。通过Skip-connection Cross Attention模块增强视觉与文本交互，支持多种偏好数据微调，在多个评估维度上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM方法需要指令跟随数据进行监督微调，且仅通过文本响应评估生成质量，耗时且难以训练。LLaVA-Reward旨在解决这一问题。

Method: LLaVA-Reward直接利用MLLMs的隐藏状态处理文本-图像对，并引入SkipCA模块增强视觉与文本的双向交互。支持配对和非配对偏好数据微调。

Result: 在文本-图像对齐、保真度/伪影、安全性和整体排名四个评估维度上，LLaVA-Reward优于传统和MLLM方法，生成更符合人类评分的自动评估结果。

Conclusion: LLaVA-Reward通过高效设计和多模态交互优化，显著提升了文本到图像生成的自动评估性能。

Abstract: We introduce LLaVA-Reward, an efficient reward model designed to
automatically evaluate text-to-image (T2I) generations across multiple
perspectives, leveraging pretrained multimodal large language models (MLLMs).
Existing MLLM-based approaches require instruction-following data for
supervised fine-tuning and evaluate generation quality on analyzing text
response, which is time-consuming and difficult to train. To address this
problem, we propose LLaVA-Reward, which directly utilizes the hidden states of
MLLMs given text-image pairs. To enhance the bidirectional interaction between
visual and textual representations in decoder-only MLLMs, we further propose
adding a Skip-connection Cross Attention (SkipCA) module. This design enhances
text-image correlation reasoning by connecting early-layer visual features with
later-layer hidden representations.In addition, LLaVA-Reward supports different
types of preference data for efficient fine-tuning, including paired preference
data and unpaired data. We train LLaVA-Reward on four evaluation perspectives:
text-image alignment, fidelity/artifact, safety, and overall ranking. Empirical
results demonstrate that LLaVA-Reward outperforms conventional and MLLM-based
methods in generating human-aligned scores for automatic evaluations and
inference-time scaling in text-to-image generations.

TL;DR: ReGATE是一种自适应令牌剪枝方法，通过教师-学生框架加速多模态大语言模型（MLLM）训练，显著减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要针对推理阶段，训练效率提升有限，ReGATE旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用教师-学生框架，结合参考损失和自适应难度评分，选择性处理关键令牌。

Result: 在VideoLLaMA2上，ReGATE达到峰值精度，速度提升2倍，令牌使用量减少35%。

Conclusion: ReGATE在减少令牌数量的同时，性能超越基线，展示了高效训练MLLM的潜力。

Abstract: The computational cost of training multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
rapidly increases with the number of tokens involved. Existing efficiency
methods primarily target inference and rely on token reduction or merging,
offering limited benefit during training. In this paper, we propose ReGATE
(Reference$-$Guided Adaptive Token Elision), an adaptive token pruning method
for accelerating MLLM training. Specifically, ReGATE adopts a teacher-student
framework in which the MLLM being trained serves as the student, and a frozen
reference large language model (LLM) acts as the teacher. The teacher computes
per-token reference losses, which are combined with an exponential moving
average (EMA) of the student's own difficulty scores. This adaptive
difficulty-based scoring enables the selective processing of crucial tokens
while bypassing less informative ones in the forward pass, significantly
reducing computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ReGATE, when
applied to VideoLLaMA2, matches the peak accuracy of standard training on
MVBench up to 2$\times$ faster, using only 35% of the tokens. With additional
training, it even surpasses the baseline on several multimodal benchmarks, all
while reducing the total token count by over 41%. Code and models will be
released soon.

TL;DR: MapDiffusion提出了一种基于扩散模型的生成方法，用于学习向量化地图的完整分布，解决了传统确定性方法无法捕捉不确定性和环境模糊性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统地图构建模型提供确定性点估计，无法处理真实环境中的不确定性和模糊性（如遮挡和缺失的车道标记）。

Method: MapDiffusion利用扩散模型，通过迭代优化随机初始化的查询（基于BEV潜在网格），生成多个可能的地图样本。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，MapDiffusion单样本性能优于基线5%，多样本聚合进一步提升了ROC曲线性能。不确定性估计在遮挡区域显著更高。

Conclusion: MapDiffusion通过建模完整地图分布，提升了在线向量化高清地图构建的鲁棒性和可靠性，支持自动驾驶在复杂环境中的不确定性感知决策。

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires an understanding of the static environment from
sensor data. Learned Bird's-Eye View (BEV) encoders are commonly used to fuse
multiple inputs, and a vector decoder predicts a vectorized map representation
from the latent BEV grid. However, traditional map construction models provide
deterministic point estimates, failing to capture uncertainty and the inherent
ambiguities of real-world environments, such as occlusions and missing lane
markings. We propose MapDiffusion, a novel generative approach that leverages
the diffusion paradigm to learn the full distribution of possible vectorized
maps. Instead of predicting a single deterministic output from learned queries,
MapDiffusion iteratively refines randomly initialized queries, conditioned on a
BEV latent grid, to generate multiple plausible map samples. This allows
aggregating samples to improve prediction accuracy and deriving uncertainty
estimates that directly correlate with scene ambiguity. Extensive experiments
on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapDiffusion achieves state-of-the-art
performance in online map construction, surpassing the baseline by 5% in
single-sample performance. We further show that aggregating multiple samples
consistently improves performance along the ROC curve, validating the benefit
of distribution modeling. Additionally, our uncertainty estimates are
significantly higher in occluded areas, reinforcing their value in identifying
regions with ambiguous sensor input. By modeling the full map distribution,
MapDiffusion enhances the robustness and reliability of online vectorized HD
map construction, enabling uncertainty-aware decision-making for autonomous
vehicles in complex environments.

Conclusion: DuCiSC通过跨图像语义一致性和可靠伪标签选择，显著提升了半监督医学图像分割性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning has proven highly effective in tackling the
challenge of limited labeled training data in medical image segmentation. In
general, current approaches, which rely on intra-image pixel-wise consistency
training via pseudo-labeling, overlook the consistency at more comprehensive
semantic levels (e.g., object region) and suffer from severe discrepancy of
extracted features resulting from an imbalanced number of labeled and unlabeled
data. To overcome these limitations, we present a new \underline{Du}al
\underline{C}ross-\underline{i}mage \underline{S}emantic
\underline{C}onsistency (DuCiSC) learning framework, for semi-supervised
medical image segmentation. Concretely, beyond enforcing pixel-wise semantic
consistency, DuCiSC proposes dual paradigms to encourage region-level semantic
consistency across: 1) labeled and unlabeled images; and 2) labeled and fused
images, by explicitly aligning their prototypes. Relying on the dual paradigms,
DuCiSC can effectively establish consistent cross-image semantics via prototype
representations, thereby addressing the feature discrepancy issue. Moreover, we
devise a novel self-aware confidence estimation strategy to accurately select
reliable pseudo labels, allowing for exploiting the training dynamics of
unlabeled data. Our DuCiSC method is extensively validated on four datasets,
including two popular binary benchmarks in segmenting the left atrium and
pancreas, a multi-class Automatic Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge dataset, and a
challenging scenario of segmenting the inferior alveolar nerve that features
complicated anatomical structures, showing superior segmentation results over
previous state-of-the-art approaches. Our code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLN任务中的导航代理存在场景表示过于详细和视觉-语言对齐模糊的问题，导致对导航友好的高层场景先验理解不足，容易违反语言指令。

Method: 提出RVI技术，通过递归总结视觉感知并建模历史轨迹为紧凑神经网格，聚焦视觉转换和语义场景布局的规律性；提出ALG技术，自适应对齐学习的情境记忆与语言组件。

Result: 在VLN-CE和ObjectNav任务上优于现有方法，验证了RVI和ALG技术的优越性。

Conclusion: RVI和ALG技术有效提升了VLN任务的导航性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Vision Language Navigation (VLN) typically requires agents to navigate to
specified objects or remote regions in unknown scenes by obeying linguistic
commands. Such tasks require organizing historical visual observations for
linguistic grounding, which is critical for long-sequence navigational
decisions. However, current agents suffer from overly detailed scene
representation and ambiguous vision-language alignment, which weaken their
comprehension of navigation-friendly high-level scene priors and easily lead to
behaviors that violate linguistic commands. To tackle these issues, we propose
a navigation policy by recursively summarizing along-the-way visual
perceptions, which are adaptively aligned with commands to enhance linguistic
grounding. In particular, by structurally modeling historical trajectories as
compact neural grids, several Recursive Visual Imagination (RVI) techniques are
proposed to motivate agents to focus on the regularity of visual transitions
and semantic scene layouts, instead of dealing with misleading geometric
details. Then, an Adaptive Linguistic Grounding (ALG) technique is proposed to
align the learned situational memories with different linguistic components
purposefully. Such fine-grained semantic matching facilitates the accurate
anticipation of navigation actions and progress. Our navigation policy
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the challenging VLN-CE and
ObjectNav tasks, showing the superiority of our RVI and ALG techniques for VLN.

Conclusion: 自监督数据集蒸馏方法有效提取数据集关键信息，提升了蒸馏集的泛化能力和实用性。

Abstract: Although larger datasets are crucial for training large deep models, the
rapid growth of dataset size has brought a significant challenge in terms of
considerable training costs, which even results in prohibitive computational
expenses. Dataset Distillation becomes a popular technique recently to reduce
the dataset size via learning a highly compact set of representative exemplars,
where the model trained with these exemplars ideally should have comparable
performance with respect to the one trained with the full dataset. While most
of existing works upon dataset distillation focus on supervised datasets, we
instead aim to distill images and their self-supervisedly trained
representations into a distilled set. This procedure, named as Self-Supervised
Dataset Distillation, effectively extracts rich information from real datasets,
yielding the distilled sets with enhanced cross-architecture generalizability.
Particularly, in order to preserve the key characteristics of original dataset
more faithfully and compactly, several novel techniques are proposed: 1) we
introduce an innovative parameterization upon images and representations via
distinct low-dimensional bases, where the base selection for parameterization
is experimentally shown to play a crucial role; 2) we tackle the instability
induced by the randomness of data augmentation -- a key component in
self-supervised learning but being underestimated in the prior work of
self-supervised dataset distillation -- by utilizing predetermined
augmentations; 3) we further leverage a lightweight network to model the
connections among the representations of augmented views from the same image,
leading to more compact pairs of distillation. Extensive experiments conducted
on various datasets validate the superiority of our approach in terms of
distillation efficiency, cross-architecture generalization, and transfer
learning performance.

Result: 实验表明S2E缓解了仅依赖离线数据的性能瓶颈，强化学习在机器人学习中的效果优于监督微调。

Conclusion: 研究强调交互式在线经验对扩展机器人基础模型能力的关键作用。

Abstract: Navigation foundation models trained on massive webscale data enable agents
to generalize across diverse environments and embodiments. However, these
models trained solely on offline data, often lack the capacity to reason about
the consequences of their actions or adapt through counterfactual
understanding. They thus face significant limitations in the real-world urban
navigation where interactive and safe behaviors, such as avoiding obstacles and
moving pedestrians, are critical. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the
Seeing-to-Experiencing framework to scale the capability of navigation
foundation models with reinforcement learning. S2E combines the strengths of
pre-training on videos and post-training through RL. It maintains the
generalizability acquired from large-scale real-world videos while enhancing
its interactivity through RL in simulation environments. Specifically, we
introduce two innovations: an Anchor-Guided Distribution Matching strategy,
which stabilizes learning and models diverse motion patterns through
anchor-based supervision; and a Residual-Attention Module, which obtains
reactive behaviors from simulation environments without erasing the model's
pretrained knowledge. Moreover, we establish a comprehensive end-to-end
evaluation benchmark, NavBench-GS, built on photorealistic 3DGS reconstructions
of real-world scenes that incorporate physical interactions. It can
systematically assess the generalizability and safety of navigation foundation
models. Extensive experiments show that S2E mitigates the diminishing returns
often seen when scaling with offline data alone. We perform a thorough analysis
of the benefits of Reinforcement Learning compared to Supervised Fine-Tuning in
the context of post-training for robot learning. Our findings emphasize the
crucial role of integrating interactive online experiences to effectively scale
foundation models in Robotics.

Result: ATINet在单目标跟踪中表现最优，并扩展至多目标跟踪验证其有效性。

Conclusion: ESI和ATINet显著提升了光场角时建模能力，适用于低光场景的目标跟踪。

Abstract: High-quality 4D light field representation with efficient angular feature
modeling is crucial for scene perception, as it can provide discriminative
spatial-angular cues to identify moving targets. However, recent developments
still struggle to deliver reliable angular modeling in the temporal domain,
particularly in complex low-light scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel
light field epipolar-plane structure image (ESI) representation that explicitly
defines the geometric structure within the light field. By capitalizing on the
abrupt changes in the angles of light rays within the epipolar plane, this
representation can enhance visual expression in low-light scenes and reduce
redundancy in high-dimensional light fields. We further propose an
angular-temporal interaction network (ATINet) for light field object tracking
that learns angular-aware representations from the geometric structural cues
and angular-temporal interaction cues of light fields. Furthermore, ATINet can
also be optimized in a self-supervised manner to enhance the geometric feature
interaction across the temporal domain. Finally, we introduce a large-scale
light field low-light dataset for object tracking. Extensive experimentation
demonstrates that ATINet achieves state-of-the-art performance in single object
tracking. Furthermore, we extend the proposed method to multiple object
tracking, which also shows the effectiveness of high-quality light field
angular-temporal modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在开放集3D物体检索中因训练数据不足而难以生成泛化表示，而CLIP在图像-文本对上的预训练提供了广泛的下游任务泛化能力。

Method: DAC框架结合CLIP和MLLM，利用MLLM描述已知类别信息以适配CLIP，并在推理时提供外部提示。引入AB-LoRA技术以减少过拟合并增强泛化能力。

Result: DAC在四个开放集3DOR数据集上平均mAP提升10.01%，并在基于图像和跨数据集的实验中验证了其泛化能力。

Conclusion: DAC通过简单有效的框架显著提升了开放集3D物体检索的性能，展示了其在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Open-set 3D object retrieval (3DOR) is an emerging task aiming to retrieve 3D
objects of unseen categories beyond the training set. Existing methods
typically utilize all modalities (i.e., voxels, point clouds, multi-view
images) and train specific backbones before fusion. However, they still
struggle to produce generalized representations due to insufficient 3D training
data. Being contrastively pre-trained on web-scale image-text pairs, CLIP
inherently produces generalized representations for a wide range of downstream
tasks. Building upon it, we present a simple yet effective framework named
Describe, Adapt and Combine (DAC) by taking only multi-view images for open-set
3DOR. DAC innovatively synergizes a CLIP model with a multi-modal large
language model (MLLM) to learn generalized 3D representations, where the MLLM
is used for dual purposes. First, it describes the seen category information to
align with CLIP's training objective for adaptation during training. Second, it
provides external hints about unknown objects complementary to visual cues
during inference. To improve the synergy, we introduce an Additive-Bias
Low-Rank adaptation (AB-LoRA), which alleviates overfitting and further
enhances the generalization to unseen categories. With only multi-view images,
DAC significantly surpasses prior arts by an average of +10.01\% mAP on four
open-set 3DOR datasets. Moreover, its generalization is also validated on
image-based and cross-dataset setups. Code is available at

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify anomalous events in videos and
accurately determine their time intervals. Current VAD methods mainly fall into
two categories: traditional DNN-based approaches that focus on temporal
localization, and LLM-based approaches that emphasize semantic understanding.
Both anomaly understanding and grounding are essential for comprehensive video
anomaly detection and can complement each other. However, no existing model or
dataset supports both tasks simultaneously. To address this, we introduce VAGU
(Video Anomaly Grounding and Understanding), the first benchmark to integrate
both tasks. Each VAGU instance includes annotations for anomaly category,
semantic explanation, precise temporal grounding and Video QA. We also provide
multiple-choice Video QA for objective evaluation. Based on this dataset, we
propose Glance then Scrutinize (GtS), a training-free framework guided by
textual prompts. The framework first enables coarse localization of
high-probability anomalous regions, followed by detailed anomaly interpretation
and temporal boundary refinement. Additionally, we propose the JeAUG metric,
which jointly evaluates semantic interpretability and temporal precision,
overcoming the limitations of traditional metrics. Extensive experiments verify
the effectiveness of our benchmark, framework, and evaluation metric.

Motivation: 解决大规模视觉语言模型中不确定性估计和高效采样的挑战。

Result: 在多个数据集和视觉骨干网络上表现优异，计算效率高。

Conclusion: 该方法在性能上超越复杂特征采样技术，并比较了Prompt学习与LoRA在样本选择中的效果。

Abstract: Active Learning (AL) has emerged as a powerful approach for minimizing
labeling costs by selectively sampling the most informative data for neural
network model development. Effective AL for large-scale vision-language models
necessitates addressing challenges in uncertainty estimation and efficient
sampling given the vast number of parameters involved. In this work, we
introduce a novel parameter-efficient learning methodology that incorporates
uncertainty calibration loss within the AL framework. We propose a
differentiable loss function that promotes uncertainty calibration for
effectively selecting fewer and most informative data samples for fine-tuning.
Through extensive experiments across several datasets and vision backbones, we
demonstrate that our solution can match and exceed the performance of complex
feature-based sampling techniques while being computationally very efficient.
Additionally, we investigate the efficacy of Prompt learning versus Low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) in sample selection, providing a detailed comparative
analysis of these methods in the context of efficient AL.

Result: 实验表明，模型在生成连贯且语义一致的烹饪过程图像上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Chain-of-Cooking有效解决了烹饪过程可视化的两大挑战，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Cooking process visualization is a promising task in the intersection of
image generation and food analysis, which aims to generate an image for each
cooking step of a recipe. However, most existing works focus on generating
images of finished foods based on the given recipes, and face two challenges to
visualize the cooking process. First, the appearance of ingredients changes
variously across cooking steps, it is difficult to generate the correct
appearances of foods that match the textual description, leading to semantic
inconsistency. Second, the current step might depend on the operations of
previous step, it is crucial to maintain the contextual coherence of images in
sequential order. In this work, we present a cooking process visualization
model, called Chain-of-Cooking. Specifically, to generate correct appearances
of ingredients, we present a Dynamic Patch Selection Module to retrieve
previously generated image patches as references, which are most related to
current textual contents. Furthermore, to enhance the coherence and keep the
rational order of generated images, we propose a Semantic Evolution Module and
a Bidirectional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Guidance. To better utilize the
semantics of previous texts, the Semantic Evolution Module establishes the
semantical association between latent prompts and current cooking step, and
merges it with the latent features. Then the CoT Guidance updates the merged
features to guide the current cooking step remain coherent with the previous
step. Moreover, we construct a dataset named CookViz, consisting of
intermediate image-text pairs for the cooking process. Quantitative and
qualitative experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods in
generating coherent and semantic consistent cooking process.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种冲突抑制的深度伪造检测框架（CS-DFD），通过两个协同模块解决训练中梯度冲突问题，提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度伪造检测模型在联合训练原始数据和在线合成伪造数据时性能下降，这与传统观点矛盾，需解决梯度冲突问题。

Method: 提出CS-DFD框架，包含更新向量搜索（UVS）模块和冲突梯度减少（CGR）模块，分别优化梯度更新和特征嵌入空间。

Result: 在多个深度伪造基准测试中，CS-DFD在域内检测和跨域泛化上均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: CS-DFD通过抑制梯度冲突，显著提升了深度伪造检测的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Robust deepfake detection models must be capable of generalizing to
ever-evolving manipulation techniques beyond training data. A promising
strategy is to augment the training data with online synthesized fake images
containing broadly generalizable artifacts. However, in the context of deepfake
detection, it is surprising that jointly training on both original and online
synthesized forgeries may result in degraded performance. This contradicts the
common belief that incorporating more source-domain data should enhance
detection accuracy. Through empirical analysis, we trace this degradation to
gradient conflicts during backpropagation which force a trade-off between
source domain accuracy and target domain generalization. To overcome this
issue, we propose a Conflict-Suppressed Deepfake Detection (CS-DFD) framework
that explicitly mitigates the gradient conflict via two synergistic modules.
First, an Update Vector Search (UVS) module searches for an alternative update
vector near the initial gradient vector to reconcile the disparities of the
original and online synthesized forgeries. By further transforming the search
process into an extremum optimization problem, UVS yields the uniquely update
vector, which maximizes the simultaneous loss reductions for each data type.
Second, a Conflict Gradient Reduction (CGR) module enforces a low-conflict
feature embedding space through a novel Conflict Descent Loss. This loss
penalizes misaligned gradient directions and guides the learning of
representations with aligned, non-conflicting gradients. The synergy of UVS and
CGR alleviates gradient interference in both parameter optimization and
representation learning. Experiments on multiple deepfake benchmarks
demonstrate that CS-DFD achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-domain
detection accuracy and cross-domain generalization.

Abstract: Attitude sensors determine the spacecraft attitude through the sensing of an
astronomical object, field or other phenomena. The Sun and fixed stars are the
two primary astronomical sensing objects. Attitude sensors are critical
components for the survival and knowledge improvement of spacecraft. Of these,
sun sensors are the most common and important sensor for spacecraft attitude
determination. The sun sensor measures the Sun vector in spacecraft
coordinates. The sun sensor calibration process is particularly difficult due
to the complex nature of the uncertainties involved. The uncertainties are
small, difficult to observe, and vary spatio-temporally over the lifecycle of
the sensor. In addition, the sensors are affected by numerous sources of
uncertainties, including manufacturing, electrical, environmental, and
interference sources. This motivates the development of advanced calibration
algorithms to minimize uncertainty over the sensor lifecycle and improve
accuracy. Although modeling and calibration techniques for sun sensors have
been explored extensively in the literature over the past two decades, there is
currently no resource that consolidates and systematically reviews this body of
work. The present review proposes a systematic mapping of sun sensor modeling
and calibration algorithms across a breadth of sensor configurations. It
specifically provides a comprehensive survey of each methodology, along with an
analysis of research gaps and recommendations for future directions in sun
sensor modeling and calibration techniques.

Conclusion: RelMap通过显式建模空间和语义关系，显著提升了在线地图构建的效果。

Abstract: Online high-definition (HD) map construction plays an increasingly important
role in scaling autonomous driving systems. Transformer-based methods have
become prevalent in online HD map construction; however, existing approaches
often neglect the inherent spatial and semantic relationships among map
elements, which limits their accuracy and generalization. To address this, we
propose RelMap, an end-to-end framework that enhances online map construction
by incorporating spatial relations and semantic priors. We introduce a
Class-aware Spatial Relation Prior, which explicitly encodes relative
positional dependencies between map elements using a learnable class-aware
relation encoder. Additionally, we propose a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based
Semantic Prior, which routes features to class-specific experts based on
predicted class probabilities, refining instance feature decoding. Our method
is compatible with both single-frame and temporal perception backbones,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on both the nuScenes and Argoverse 2
datasets.

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet上，LinDeps提升了现有剪枝技术的压缩率并保持性能，在低资源设置下表现优异。

Conclusion: LinDeps是当前和未来剪枝技术的重要补充，显著提升剪枝效果和推理速度。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are widely used in many computer vision
tasks. Yet, their increasing size and complexity pose significant challenges
for efficient deployment on resource-constrained platforms. Hence, network
pruning has emerged as an effective way of reducing the size and computational
requirements of neural networks by removing redundant or unimportant
parameters. However, a fundamental challenge with pruning consists in optimally
removing redundancies without degrading performance. Most existing pruning
techniques overlook structural dependencies across feature maps within a layer,
resulting in suboptimal pruning decisions. In this work, we introduce LinDeps,
a novel post-pruning method, i.e., a pruning method that can be applied on top
of any pruning technique, which systematically identifies and removes redundant
filters via linear dependency analysis. Particularly, LinDeps applies pivoted
QR decomposition to feature maps to detect and prune linearly dependent
filters. Then, a novel signal recovery mechanism adjusts the next layer's
kernels to preserve compatibility and performance without requiring any
fine-tuning. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with VGG and ResNet
backbones demonstrate that LinDeps improves compression rates of existing
pruning techniques while preserving performances, leading to a new state of the
art in CNN pruning. We also benchmark LinDeps in low-resource setups where no
retraining can be performed, which shows significant pruning improvements and
inference speedups over a state-of-the-art method. LinDeps therefore
constitutes an essential add-on for any current or future pruning technique.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出TARS方法，通过动态调整偏好优化策略，减少多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有直接偏好优化（DPO）方法在处理幻觉问题时依赖静态监督信号，容易过拟合，导致视觉信息关联性不足。

Method: 提出TARS方法，将DPO重新定义为最小-最大优化问题，通过最大化语义约束下的分布偏移来模拟对齐不确定性。

Result: TARS在多个基准测试中表现优异，仅需4.8k偏好样本即可将幻觉率从26.4%降至13.2%，认知值从2.5降至0.4。

Conclusion: TARS有效减少多模态推理中的幻觉问题，性能优于标准DPO，部分指标媲美GPT-4o。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable vision-language reasoning,
yet often generate plausible outputs that are factually incorrect or visually
ungrounded, thereby compromising their reliability. Direct preference
optimization (DPO) is a common strategy for correcting hallucinations by
aligning model outputs with human preferences. Existing DPO strategies
typically treat hallucination-related preferences as fixed targets, relying on
static supervision signals during training. This approach tends to overfit to
superficial linguistic cues in preference data, leading to distributional
rigidity and spurious correlations that impair grounding in causally relevant
visual information. To overcome this limitation, we propose TARS, a
token-adaptive preference strategy that reformulates DPO as a min-max
optimization problem. TARS maximizes token-level distributional shifts under
semantic constraints to simulate alignment uncertainty, and simultaneously
minimizes the expected preference loss under these controlled perturbations.
This joint objective preserves causal grounding while mitigating overfitting to
preference patterns, thereby reducing hallucinations in multimodal reasoning.
We evaluate TARS on multiple hallucination benchmarks and find consistently
strong performance. Using only 4.8k preference samples and no expert feedback,
TARS reduces hallucination rates from 26.4% to 13.2% and decreases cognition
value from 2.5 to 0.4. It outperforms standard DPO and matches GPT-4o on
several key metrics.

Conclusion: 本文为熟悉WSSS基础的研究者提供了当前进展和方法创新的深入理解，并指出了未来的研究潜力。

Abstract: Unlike fully supervised semantic segmentation, weakly supervised semantic
segmentation (WSSS) relies on weaker forms of supervision to perform dense
prediction tasks. Among the various types of weak supervision, WSSS with image
level annotations is considered both the most challenging and the most
practical, attracting significant research attention. Therefore, in this
review, we focus on WSSS with image level annotations. Additionally, this
review concentrates on mainstream research directions, deliberately omitting
less influential branches.
  Given the rapid development of new methods and the limitations of existing
surveys in capturing recent trends, there is a pressing need for an updated and
comprehensive review. Our goal is to fill this gap by synthesizing the latest
advancements and state-of-the-art techniques in WSSS with image level labels.
  Basically, we provide a comprehensive review of recent advancements in WSSS
with image level labels, categorizing existing methods based on the types and
levels of additional supervision involved. We also examine the challenges of
applying advanced methods to domain specific datasets in WSSS,a topic that
remains underexplored. Finally, we discuss the current challenges, evaluate the
limitations of existing approaches, and outline several promising directions
for future research. This review is intended for researchers who are already
familiar with the fundamental concepts of WSSS and are seeking to deepen their
understanding of current advances and methodological innovations.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在身份保留、高保真图像和自然可控老化进程三个方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了更真实和个性化的面部老化效果，优于现有技术。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to face aging that addresses the limitations of
current methods which treat aging as a global, homogeneous process. Existing
techniques using GANs and diffusion models often condition generation on a
reference image and target age, neglecting that facial regions age
heterogeneously due to both intrinsic chronological factors and extrinsic
elements like sun exposure. Our method leverages latent diffusion models to
selectively age specific facial regions using local aging signs. This approach
provides significantly finer-grained control over the generation process,
enabling more realistic and personalized aging. We employ a latent diffusion
refiner to seamlessly blend these locally aged regions, ensuring a globally
consistent and natural-looking synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that
our method effectively achieves three key criteria for successful face aging:
robust identity preservation, high-fidelity and realistic imagery, and a
natural, controllable aging progression.

Method: 提出解耦的时空一致性训练框架，结合全局空间定位和局部时间关联，以及多视角的实例对比损失。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现优于现有自监督方法，AUC（AO）分数提升显著。

Conclusion: SSTrack框架有效减少了对手动标注的依赖，同时提升了跟踪性能。

Abstract: The success of visual tracking has been largely driven by datasets with
manual box annotations. However, these box annotations require tremendous human
effort, limiting the scale and diversity of existing tracking datasets. In this
work, we present a novel Self-Supervised Tracking framework named
\textbf{{\tracker}}, designed to eliminate the need of box annotations.
Specifically, a decoupled spatio-temporal consistency training framework is
proposed to learn rich target information across timestamps through global
spatial localization and local temporal association. This allows for the
simulation of appearance and motion variations of instances in real-world
scenarios. Furthermore, an instance contrastive loss is designed to learn
instance-level correspondences from a multi-view perspective, offering robust
instance supervision without additional labels. This new design paradigm
enables {\tracker} to effectively learn generic tracking representations in a
self-supervised manner, while reducing reliance on extensive box annotations.
Extensive experiments on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate that {\tracker}
surpasses \textit{SOTA} self-supervised tracking methods, achieving an
improvement of more than 25.3\%, 20.4\%, and 14.8\% in AUC (AO) score on the
GOT10K, LaSOT, TrackingNet datasets, respectively. Code:

Result: DeepLabv3在低对比度边界的分割任务中表现更优，证明了简单模型的潜力。

Conclusion: 在特定生物医学应用中，适当简化的模型可能比复杂模型更可靠，支持开源实现以促进相关领域发展。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation requires not only accuracy but also robustness
under challenging imaging conditions. In this study, we show that a carefully
configured DeepLabv3 model can achieve high performance in segmenting induced
pluripotent stem (iPS) cell colonies, and, under our experimental conditions,
outperforms large-scale foundation models such as SAM2 and its medical variant
MedSAM2 without structural modifications. These results suggest that, for
specialized tasks characterized by subtle, low-contrast boundaries, increased
model complexity does not necessarily translate to better performance. Our work
revisits the assumption that ever-larger and more generalized architectures are
always preferable, and provides evidence that appropriately adapted, simpler
models may offer strong accuracy and practical reliability in domain-specific
biomedical applications. We also offer an open-source implementation that
includes strategies for small datasets and domain-specific encoding, with the
aim of supporting further advances in semantic segmentation for regenerative
medicine and related fields.

Conclusion: 合成数据方法有效提升检测性能，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: For the autonomous drone-based inspection of wind turbine (WT) blades,
accurate detection of the WT and its key features is essential for safe drone
positioning and collision avoidance. Existing deep learning methods typically
rely on manually labeled real-world images, which limits both the quantity and
the diversity of training datasets in terms of weather conditions, lighting,
turbine types, and image complexity. In this paper, we propose a method to
generate synthetic training data that allows controlled variation of visual and
environmental factors, increasing the diversity and hence creating challenging
learning scenarios. Furthermore, we train a YOLOv11 feature detection network
solely on synthetic WT images with a modified loss function, to detect WTs and
their key features within an image. The resulting network is evaluated both
using synthetic images and a set of real-world WT images and shows promising
performance across both synthetic and real-world data, achieving a Pose
mAP50-95 of 0.97 on real images never seen during training.

Motivation: 工业异常检测对制造系统的安全和可靠性至关重要，但现有MLLMs在IAD中表现有限，需领域特定适配。

Method: EMIT构建多任务IAD数据集，利用GPT生成文本描述补充缺陷图像缺失，结合软提示和热图引导的对比嵌入进行少样本检测，并提出难度感知GRPO优化困难样本处理。

Result: 在MMAD基准测试中，EMIT显著提升MLLMs的IAD性能，平均提升7.77%。

Conclusion: EMIT通过创新优化策略有效提升了MLLMs在工业异常检测中的表现。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) plays a crucial role in maintaining the
safety and reliability of manufacturing systems. While multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) show strong vision-language reasoning abilities, their
effectiveness in IAD remains limited without domain-specific adaptation. In
this work, we propose EMIT, a unified framework that enhances MLLMs for IAD via
difficulty-aware group relative policy optimization (GRPO). EMIT constructs a
multi-task IAD dataset and utilizes GPT-generated object text descriptions to
compensate for missing defective images. For few-shot anomaly detection, it
integrates a soft prompt and heatmap-guided contrastive embeddings derived from
patch-level comparisons. To better handle difficult data samples, i.e., cases
where the MLLM struggles to generate correct answers, we propose a
difficulty-aware GRPO that extends the original GRPO by incorporating a
response resampling strategy to ensure the inclusion of correct answers in the
sampled responses, as well as an advantage reweighting mechanism to strengthen
learning from such difficult data samples. Extensive experiments on the MMAD
benchmark demonstrate that EMIT significantly enhances the IAD performance of
MLLMs, achieving an average improvement of 7.77\% over the base model
(InternVL3-8B) across seven tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的多模态修复方法需要架构修改和重新训练，计算成本高；而上下文感知方法虽无需训练，但对掩码区域缺乏精细控制，导致修复结果语义不一致或视觉不真实。

Method: GuidPaint通过将分类器引导引入去噪过程，实现对掩码区域的精确控制，并结合随机和确定性采样策略，允许用户选择和优化中间结果。

Result: 实验表明，GuidPaint在定性和定量评估中均优于现有上下文感知修复方法。

Conclusion: GuidPaint提供了一种高效且无需训练的修复方案，显著提升了修复质量与控制能力。

Abstract: In recent years, diffusion models have been widely adopted for image
inpainting tasks due to their powerful generative capabilities, achieving
impressive results. Existing multimodal inpainting methods based on diffusion
models often require architectural modifications and retraining, resulting in
high computational cost. In contrast, context-aware diffusion inpainting
methods leverage the model's inherent priors to adjust intermediate denoising
steps, enabling high-quality inpainting without additional training and
significantly reducing computation. However, these methods lack fine-grained
control over the masked regions, often leading to semantically inconsistent or
visually implausible content. To address this issue, we propose GuidPaint, a
training-free, class-guided image inpainting framework. By incorporating
classifier guidance into the denoising process, GuidPaint enables precise
control over intermediate generations within the masked areas, ensuring both
semantic consistency and visual realism. Furthermore, it integrates stochastic
and deterministic sampling, allowing users to select preferred intermediate
results and deterministically refine them. Experimental results demonstrate
that GuidPaint achieves clear improvements over existing context-aware
inpainting methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) aims to identify and ground anomalous behaviors
or events in videos, serving as a core technology in the fields of intelligent
surveillance and public safety. With the advancement of deep learning, the
continuous evolution of deep model architectures has driven innovation in VAD
methodologies, significantly enhancing feature representation and scene
adaptability, thereby improving algorithm generalization and expanding
application boundaries. More importantly, the rapid development of multi-modal
large language (MLLMs) and large language models (LLMs) has introduced new
opportunities and challenges to the VAD field. Under the support of MLLMs and
LLMs, VAD has undergone significant transformations in terms of data
annotation, input modalities, model architectures, and task objectives. The
surge in publications and the evolution of tasks have created an urgent need
for systematic reviews of recent advancements. This paper presents the first
comprehensive survey analyzing VAD methods based on MLLMs and LLMs, providing
an in-depth discussion of the changes occurring in the VAD field in the era of
large models and their underlying causes. Additionally, this paper proposes a
unified framework that encompasses both deep neural network (DNN)-based and
LLM-based VAD methods, offering a thorough analysis of the new VAD paradigms
empowered by LLMs, constructing a classification system, and comparing their
strengths and weaknesses. Building on this foundation, this paper focuses on
current VAD methods based on MLLMs/LLMs. Finally, based on the trajectory of
technological advancements and existing bottlenecks, this paper distills key
challenges and outlines future research directions, offering guidance for the
VAD community.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对南极底栖生物监测的定制化目标检测框架，解决了海洋生态图像的关键挑战，并展示了在25种细粒度形态类型上的强性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 南极底栖生物监测对理解气候变化下的生态变化至关重要，但传统手动标注方法效率低下，阻碍大规模分析。

Method: 结合分辨率保持的分块、空间数据增强、微调和后处理技术（如Slicing Aided Hyper Inference），并评估了多种目标检测架构。

Result: 在中型和大型生物检测上表现优异，但对小型和稀有类群的检测仍有挑战。

Conclusion: 该框架为未来机器辅助的底栖生物监测研究提供了可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Monitoring benthic biodiversity in Antarctica is vital for understanding
ecological change in response to climate-driven pressures. This work is
typically performed using high-resolution imagery captured in situ, though
manual annotation of such data remains laborious and specialised, impeding
large-scale analysis. We present a tailored object detection framework for
identifying and classifying Antarctic benthic organisms in high-resolution
towed camera imagery, alongside the first public computer vision dataset for
benthic biodiversity monitoring in the Weddell Sea. Our approach addresses key
challenges associated with marine ecological imagery, including limited
annotated data, variable object sizes, and complex seafloor structure. The
proposed framework combines resolution-preserving patching, spatial data
augmentation, fine-tuning, and postprocessing via Slicing Aided Hyper
Inference. We benchmark multiple object detection architectures and demonstrate
strong performance in detecting medium and large organisms across 25
fine-grained morphotypes, significantly more than other works in this area.
Detection of small and rare taxa remains a challenge, reflecting limitations in
current detection architectures. Our framework provides a scalable foundation
for future machine-assisted in situ benthic biodiversity monitoring research.

*Sangmin Han,Jinho Jeong,Jinwoo Kim,Seon Joo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: APT提出了一种解决LDMs在高分辨率图像生成中问题的训练无关方法，通过自适应路径追踪提升细节和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定分辨率的LDMs在高分辨率图像生成中存在局限性，传统训练方法成本高，而现有补丁方法存在分布偏移和单调性问题。

Method: 提出APT框架，结合统计匹配和尺度感知调度，解决补丁分布偏移和单调性问题。

Result: APT生成更清晰的高分辨率图像，同时加快采样速度，实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: APT为高分辨率图像生成提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are generally trained at fixed resolutions,
limiting their capability when scaling up to high-resolution images. While
training-based approaches address this limitation by training on
high-resolution datasets, they require large amounts of data and considerable
computational resources, making them less practical. Consequently,
training-free methods, particularly patch-based approaches, have become a
popular alternative. These methods divide an image into patches and fuse the
denoising paths of each patch, showing strong performance on high-resolution
generation. However, we observe two critical issues for patch-based approaches,
which we call ``patch-level distribution shift" and ``increased patch
monotonicity." To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Path Tracing (APT),
a framework that combines Statistical Matching to ensure patch distributions
remain consistent in upsampled latents and Scale-aware Scheduling to deal with
the patch monotonicity. As a result, APT produces clearer and more refined
details in high-resolution images. In addition, APT enables a shortcut
denoising process, resulting in faster sampling with minimal quality
degradation. Our experimental results confirm that APT produces more detailed
outputs with improved inference speed, providing a practical approach to
high-resolution image generation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种分步框架，通过身份阻断和医学语义补偿解决医学图像去标识化问题，同时引入特征解耦策略以消除残留身份信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像去标识化方法未能充分保护医学语义且缺乏隐私级别灵活性，亟需改进。

Method: 采用分步框架：1) 身份阻断以调整隐私级别；2) 利用预训练医学基础模型补偿语义；3) 基于最小描述长度原则解耦残留身份信息。

Result: 在七个数据集和三个下游任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架在医学图像去标识化中实现了隐私保护与语义保留的平衡，性能领先。

Abstract: Medical imaging has significantly advanced computer-aided diagnosis, yet its
re-identification (ReID) risks raise critical privacy concerns, calling for
de-identification (DeID) techniques. Unfortunately, existing DeID methods
neither particularly preserve medical semantics, nor are flexibly adjustable
towards different privacy levels. To address these issues, we propose a
divide-and-conquer framework comprising two steps: (1) Identity-Blocking, which
blocks varying proportions of identity-related regions, to achieve different
privacy levels; and (2) Medical-Semantics-Compensation, which leverages
pre-trained Medical Foundation Models (MFMs) to extract medical semantic
features to compensate the blocked regions. Moreover, recognizing that features
from MFMs may still contain residual identity information, we introduce a
Minimum Description Length principle-based feature decoupling strategy, to
effectively decouple and discard such identity components. Extensive
evaluations against existing approaches across seven datasets and three
downstream tasks, demonstrates our state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: 该框架为水下图像增强技术的评估提供了实用且相关的标准，强化了其在真实场景中的应用价值。

Abstract: We introduce local matching stability and furthest matchable frame as
quantitative measures for evaluating the success of underwater image
enhancement. This enhancement process addresses visual degradation caused by
light absorption, scattering, marine growth, and debris. Enhanced imagery plays
a critical role in downstream tasks such as path detection and autonomous
navigation for underwater vehicles, relying on robust feature extraction and
frame matching. To assess the impact of enhancement techniques on
frame-matching performance, we propose a novel evaluation framework tailored to
underwater environments. Through metric-based analysis, we identify strengths
and limitations of existing approaches and pinpoint gaps in their assessment of
real-world applicability. By incorporating a practical matching strategy, our
framework offers a robust, context-aware benchmark for comparing enhancement
methods. Finally, we demonstrate how visual improvements affect the performance
of a complete real-world algorithm -- Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM) -- reinforcing the framework's relevance to operational underwater
scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文通过神经科学启发的消融研究，分析了三种检测Transformer模型（DETR、DDETR、DINO）内部组件的作用，揭示了模型对特定组件消融的敏感性和冗余性，为模型优化和透明性提升提供了见解。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增强复杂模型（如检测Transformer）的透明性和效率，填补了理解内部组件作用的研究空白。

Method: 采用神经科学启发的消融方法，系统分析DETR、DDETR和DINO中关键组件（如查询嵌入、MHSA、MHCA）对性能的影响。

Result: 发现模型对消融的敏感性和冗余性：DETR对编码器MHSA和解码器MHCA敏感，DDETR因多尺度可变形注意力更鲁棒，DINO因知识分布机制最鲁棒。

Conclusion: 研究为检测Transformer的透明性和效率优化提供了新见解，揭示了结构冗余和简化机会。

Abstract: In recent years, Explainable AI has gained traction as an approach to
enhancing model interpretability and transparency, particularly in complex
models such as detection transformers. Despite rapid advancements, a
substantial research gap remains in understanding the distinct roles of
internal components - knowledge that is essential for improving transparency
and efficiency. Inspired by neuroscientific ablation studies, which investigate
the functions of brain regions through selective impairment, we systematically
analyze the impact of ablating key components in three state-of-the-art
detection transformer models: Detection transformer (DETR), deformable
detection transformer (DDETR), and DETR with improved denoising anchor boxes
(DINO). The ablations target query embeddings, encoder and decoder multi-head
self-attentions (MHSA) as well as decoder multi-head cross-attention (MHCA)
layers. We evaluate the effects of these ablations on the performance metrics
gIoU and F1-score, quantifying effects on both the classification and
regression sub-tasks on the COCO dataset. To facilitate reproducibility and
future research, we publicly release the DeepDissect library. Our findings
reveal model-specific resilience patterns: while DETR is particularly sensitive
to ablations in encoder MHSA and decoder MHCA, DDETR's multi-scale deformable
attention enhances robustness, and DINO exhibits the greatest resilience due to
its look-forward twice update rule, which helps distributing knowledge across
blocks. These insights also expose structural redundancies, particularly in
DDETR's and DINO's decoder MHCA layers, highlighting opportunities for model
simplification without sacrificing performance. This study advances XAI for
DETRs by clarifying the contributions of internal components to model
performance, offering insights to optimize and improve transparency and
efficiency in critical applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAMITE模型基于SAM2改进，通过原型记忆库和位置提示生成器解决VOT中的遮挡和干扰问题，提升跟踪精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VOT方法忽视时间依赖或泛化性差，且无法处理遮挡和干扰。

Method: 提出SAMITE模型，包含原型记忆库（筛选最佳帧）和位置提示生成器（提供位置线索）。

Result: 在六个基准测试中表现优越。

Conclusion: SAMITE有效解决了VOT中的关键问题，提升了跟踪性能。

Abstract: Visual Object Tracking (VOT) is widely used in applications like autonomous
driving to continuously track targets in videos. Existing methods can be
roughly categorized into template matching and autoregressive methods, where
the former usually neglects the temporal dependencies across frames and the
latter tends to get biased towards the object categories during training,
showing weak generalizability to unseen classes. To address these issues, some
methods propose to adapt the video foundation model SAM2 for VOT, where the
tracking results of each frame would be encoded as memory for conditioning the
rest of frames in an autoregressive manner. Nevertheless, existing methods fail
to overcome the challenges of object occlusions and distractions, and do not
have any measures to intercept the propagation of tracking errors. To tackle
them, we present a SAMITE model, built upon SAM2 with additional modules,
including: (1) Prototypical Memory Bank: We propose to quantify the
feature-wise and position-wise correctness of each frame's tracking results,
and select the best frames to condition subsequent frames. As the features of
occluded and distracting objects are feature-wise and position-wise inaccurate,
their scores would naturally be lower and thus can be filtered to intercept
error propagation; (2) Positional Prompt Generator: To further reduce the
impacts of distractors, we propose to generate positional mask prompts to
provide explicit positional clues for the target, leading to more accurate
tracking. Extensive experiments have been conducted on six benchmarks, showing
the superiority of SAMITE. The code is available at
https://github.com/Sam1224/SAMITE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习中视觉编码后的空间和语义损失是关键挑战，现有方法存在向量间隙或语义差异，导致信息丢失。

Method: 提出MAGE框架，引入IAN实现维度与语义对齐，结合交叉熵和均方误差训练策略，并开发微调数据集增强模型输出能力。

Result: MAGE在多个评测基准（MME、MMBench、SEED）上表现优于同类工作。

Conclusion: MAGE通过创新对齐机制和训练策略，有效提升多模态模型的性能与对齐效果。

Abstract: In the latest advancements in multimodal learning, effectively addressing the
spatial and semantic losses of visual data after encoding remains a critical
challenge. This is because the performance of large multimodal models is
positively correlated with the coupling between visual encoders and large
language models. Existing approaches often face issues such as vector gaps or
semantic disparities, resulting in information loss during the propagation
process. To address these issues, we propose MAGE (Multimodal Alignment and
Generation Enhancement), a novel framework that bridges the semantic spaces of
vision and text through an innovative alignment mechanism. By introducing the
Intelligent Alignment Network (IAN), MAGE achieves dimensional and semantic
alignment. To reduce the gap between synonymous heterogeneous data, we employ a
training strategy that combines cross-entropy and mean squared error,
significantly enhancing the alignment effect. Moreover, to enhance MAGE's
"Any-to-Any" capability, we developed a fine-tuning dataset for multimodal
tool-calling instructions to expand the model's output capability boundaries.
Finally, our proposed multimodal large model architecture, MAGE, achieved
significantly better performance compared to similar works across various
evaluation benchmarks, including MME, MMBench, and SEED. Complete code and
appendix are available at: https://github.com/GTCOM-NLP/MAGE.

*Shijie Wang,Jian Shi,Haojie Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdvRF提出了一种对抗性重建反馈框架，用于学习类别无关的差异表示，以解决现有细粒度图像检索方法对预定义类别的依赖问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有细粒度图像检索方法依赖于预定义类别的监督，导致检索表示中引入类别特定语义，限制了其对未见类别的泛化能力。

Method: AdvRF通过结合检索模型的类别感知差异定位和重建模型的类别无关特征学习，将FGIR重新定义为视觉差异重建任务。

Result: AdvRF在细粒度和粗粒度数据集上均表现出色。

Conclusion: AdvRF通过对抗性重建反馈框架，成功实现了类别无关的差异表示学习，提升了检索模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Existing fine-grained image retrieval (FGIR) methods predominantly rely on
supervision from predefined categories to learn discriminative representations
for retrieving fine-grained objects. However, they inadvertently introduce
category-specific semantics into the retrieval representation, creating
semantic dependencies on predefined classes that critically hinder
generalization to unseen categories. To tackle this, we propose AdvRF, a novel
adversarial reconstruction feedback framework aimed at learning
category-agnostic discrepancy representations. Specifically, AdvRF reformulates
FGIR as a visual discrepancy reconstruction task via synergizing category-aware
discrepancy localization from retrieval models with category-agnostic feature
learning from reconstruction models. The reconstruction model exposes residual
discrepancies overlooked by the retrieval model, forcing it to improve
localization accuracy, while the refined signals from the retrieval model guide
the reconstruction model to improve its reconstruction ability. Consequently,
the retrieval model localizes visual differences, while the reconstruction
model encodes these differences into category-agnostic representations. This
representation is then transferred to the retrieval model through knowledge
distillation for efficient deployment. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
demonstrate that our AdvRF achieves impressive performance on both widely-used
fine-grained and coarse-grained datasets.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于少量样本的强化学习框架（RLVR），用于卫星图像任务，无需标注数据，仅需少量示例即可显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决遥感等专业领域标注数据稀缺且昂贵的问题，开发高效、低成本的视觉-语言推理模型。

Method: 采用1-shot RLVR框架，结合策略梯度优化和轻量级规则奖励（如IoU），仅需少量示例即可训练模型。

Result: 在多个遥感任务中，仅1个示例即可显著提升性能，128个示例可媲美或超越传统大规模标注数据训练的模型。

Conclusion: RLVR框架为数据稀缺领域提供了一种高效、低成本的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language and vision-language models have enabled
strong reasoning capabilities, yet they remain impractical for specialized
domains like remote sensing, where annotated data is scarce and expensive. We
present the first few-shot reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR)
framework for satellite imagery that eliminates the need for caption
supervision--relying solely on lightweight, rule-based binary or IoU-based
rewards. Adapting the "1-shot RLVR" paradigm from language models to
vision-language models, we employ policy-gradient optimization with as few as
one curated example to align model outputs for satellite reasoning tasks.
Comprehensive experiments across multiple remote sensing benchmarks--including
classification, visual question answering, and grounding--show that even a
single example yields substantial improvements over the base model. Scaling to
128 examples matches or exceeds models trained on thousands of annotated
samples. While the extreme one-shot setting can induce mild, task-specific
overfitting, our approach consistently demonstrates robust generalization and
efficiency across diverse tasks. Further, we find that prompt design and loss
weighting significantly influence training stability and final accuracy. Our
method enables cost-effective and data-efficient development of
domain-specialist vision-language reasoning models, offering a pragmatic recipe
for data-scarce fields: start from a compact VLM, curate a handful of
reward-checkable cases, and train via RLVR.

Result: 实验表明，LiteFat在保持竞争力的同时显著降低了计算复杂性和延迟。

Conclusion: LiteFat为嵌入式设备提供了实时、高效的疲劳检测解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting driver fatigue is critical for road safety, as drowsy driving
remains a leading cause of traffic accidents. Many existing solutions rely on
computationally demanding deep learning models, which result in high latency
and are unsuitable for embedded robotic devices with limited resources (such as
intelligent vehicles/cars) where rapid detection is necessary to prevent
accidents. This paper introduces LiteFat, a lightweight spatio-temporal graph
learning model designed to detect driver fatigue efficiently while maintaining
high accuracy and low computational demands. LiteFat involves converting
streaming video data into spatio-temporal graphs (STG) using facial landmark
detection, which focuses on key motion patterns and reduces unnecessary data
processing. LiteFat uses MobileNet to extract facial features and create a
feature matrix for the STG. A lightweight spatio-temporal graph neural network
is then employed to identify signs of fatigue with minimal processing and low
latency. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that LiteFat performs
competitively while significantly decreasing computational complexity and
latency as compared to current state-of-the-art methods. This work enables the
development of real-time, resource-efficient human fatigue detection systems
that can be implemented upon embedded robotic devices.

Conclusion: 动态递归是高效视觉Transformer的有效策略，为可扩展和可部署的深度学习模型开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success in image
recognition, yet standard ViT architectures are hampered by substantial
parameter redundancy and high computational cost, limiting their practical
deployment. While recent efforts on efficient ViTs primarily focus on static
model compression or token-level sparsification, they remain constrained by
fixed computational depth for all tokens. In this work, we present MoR-ViT, a
novel vision transformer framework that, for the first time, incorporates a
token-level dynamic recursion mechanism inspired by the Mixture-of-Recursions
(MoR) paradigm. This approach enables each token to adaptively determine its
processing depth, yielding a flexible and input-dependent allocation of
computational resources. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K and transfer
benchmarks demonstrate that MoR-ViT not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
with up to 70% parameter reduction and 2.5x inference acceleration, but also
outperforms leading efficient ViT baselines such as DynamicViT and TinyViT
under comparable conditions. These results establish dynamic recursion as an
effective strategy for efficient vision transformers and open new avenues for
scalable and deployable deep learning models in real-world scenarios.

Result: 在CASME II和SAMM数据集上，AU-LLM通过LOSO和跨域协议测试，达到了新的最优性能。

Conclusion: AU-LLM验证了LLM在微表情分析中的潜力和鲁棒性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: The detection of micro-expression Action Units (AUs) is a formidable
challenge in affective computing, pivotal for decoding subtle, involuntary
human emotions. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate profound
reasoning abilities, their application to the fine-grained, low-intensity
domain of micro-expression AU detection remains unexplored. This paper pioneers
this direction by introducing \textbf{AU-LLM}, a novel framework that for the
first time uses LLM to detect AUs in micro-expression datasets with subtle
intensities and the scarcity of data. We specifically address the critical
vision-language semantic gap, the \textbf{Enhanced Fusion Projector (EFP)}. The
EFP employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to intelligently fuse mid-level
(local texture) and high-level (global semantics) visual features from a
specialized 3D-CNN backbone into a single, information-dense token. This
compact representation effectively empowers the LLM to perform nuanced
reasoning over subtle facial muscle movements.Through extensive evaluations on
the benchmark CASME II and SAMM datasets, including stringent
Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) and cross-domain protocols, AU-LLM establishes a
new state-of-the-art, validating the significant potential and robustness of
LLM-based reasoning for micro-expression analysis. The codes are available at

Abstract: Vision-language pre-trained models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated
remarkable zero-shot generalization, and prompt learning has emerged as an
efficient alternative to full fine-tuning. However, existing methods often
struggle with generalization to novel classes, a phenomenon attributed to
overfitting on seen classes and forgetting general knowledge. Furthermore,
recent approaches that improve generalization often introduce complex
architectures or heavy computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a
Multiple Semantic-Guided Context Optimization (MSGCoOp) framework to enhance
few-shot generalization while maintaining computational efficiency. Our
approach leverages an ensemble of parallel learnable context vectors to capture
diverse semantic aspects. To enrich these prompts, we introduce a semantic
guidance mechanism that aligns them with comprehensive class descriptions
automatically generated by a Large Language Model (LLM). Furthermore, a
diversity regularization loss encourages the prompts to learn complementary and
orthogonal features, preventing them from collapsing into redundant
representations. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets show that
MSGCoOp significantly improves performance on base-to-novel generalization,
achieving an average harmonic mean improvement of 1.10\% over the strong KgCoOp
baseline. Our method also demonstrates enhanced robustness in cross-domain
generalization tasks. Our code is avaliable at:

in medical image analysis. Building on previous methods and focusing on Chest
X-Rays, our approach utilizes structured text reports generated by a large
language model (LLM) to augment image data with clinically relevant context.
These reports begin with a definition of the disease, followed by the
`appearance' section to highlight critical regions of interest, and finally
`observations' and `verdicts' that ground model predictions in clinical
semantics. By modeling both inter- and intra-modal uncertainty, our framework
captures the inherent ambiguity in medical images and text, yielding improved
representations and performance on downstream tasks. Our model demonstrates
significant advances in medical image-text pre-training, obtaining
state-of-the-art performance on multiple downstream tasks.

TL;DR: HunyuanWorld 1.0提出了一种结合视频和3D方法优势的框架，用于从文本或图像生成沉浸式、可探索的3D场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在3D一致性和渲染效率上的不足，以及训练数据有限和内存效率低的问题。

Method: 采用全景世界代理和语义分层的3D网格表示，支持360度沉浸体验、网格导出和解耦对象表示。

Result: 实验表明该方法在生成一致、可探索和交互的3D世界上达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: HunyuanWorld 1.0在虚拟现实、游戏开发等领域具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Creating immersive and playable 3D worlds from texts or images remains a
fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. Existing world
generation approaches typically fall into two categories: video-based methods
that offer rich diversity but lack 3D consistency and rendering efficiency, and
3D-based methods that provide geometric consistency but struggle with limited
training data and memory-inefficient representations. To address these
limitations, we present HunyuanWorld 1.0, a novel framework that combines the
best of both worlds for generating immersive, explorable, and interactive 3D
scenes from text and image conditions. Our approach features three key
advantages: 1) 360{\deg} immersive experiences via panoramic world proxies; 2)
mesh export capabilities for seamless compatibility with existing computer
graphics pipelines; 3) disentangled object representations for augmented
interactivity. The core of our framework is a semantically layered 3D mesh
representation that leverages panoramic images as 360{\deg} world proxies for
semantic-aware world decomposition and reconstruction, enabling the generation
of diverse 3D worlds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating coherent, explorable, and
interactive 3D worlds while enabling versatile applications in virtual reality,
physical simulation, game development, and interactive content creation.

Motivation: 尽管在内容审核和对齐方面取得了进展，但大型语言模型和文本到图像系统仍易受提示攻击（越狱）。这些攻击通常由非专家用户通过简单但巧妙的提示实现，因此需要深入研究其机制。

Method: 通过系统化调查，分析了多轮叙事升级、词汇伪装、隐含链、虚构冒充和微妙语义编辑等技术，并提出了统一的提示级越狱策略分类。

Result: 研究发现，从输入过滤到输出验证的每个审核阶段都可能被绕过，且这些策略易于在现实环境中复制。

Conclusion: 论文强调需要开发上下文感知的防御措施，以应对这些易于复制的越狱策略。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in alignment and content moderation, large
language models (LLMs) and text-to-image (T2I) systems remain vulnerable to
prompt-based attacks known as jailbreaks. Unlike traditional adversarial
examples requiring expert knowledge, many of today's jailbreaks are low-effort,
high-impact crafted by everyday users with nothing more than cleverly worded
prompts. This paper presents a systems-style investigation into how non-experts
reliably circumvent safety mechanisms through techniques such as multi-turn
narrative escalation, lexical camouflage, implication chaining, fictional
impersonation, and subtle semantic edits. We propose a unified taxonomy of
prompt-level jailbreak strategies spanning both text-output and T2I models,
grounded in empirical case studies across popular APIs. Our analysis reveals
that every stage of the moderation pipeline, from input filtering to output
validation, can be bypassed with accessible strategies. We conclude by
highlighting the urgent need for context-aware defenses that reflect the ease
with which these jailbreaks can be reproduced in real-world settings.

TL;DR: 提出一种简单的跨架构知识蒸馏方法，通过抑制冗余信息实现知识迁移，优于现有方法且参数更少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因复杂模块和过多参数而效率低下，需一种更高效、通用的跨架构知识蒸馏方法。

Method: 提出冗余抑制蒸馏（RSD）损失，结合跨架构不变性最大化和特征去相关目标，并设计轻量模块保护学生模型的架构特定能力。

Result: 在CIFAR-100和ImageNet-1k上优于OFA方法，参数开销更小。

Conclusion: 该方法简单高效，可作为跨架构知识蒸馏的强基线。

Abstract: We describe a simple method for cross-architecture knowledge distillation,
where the knowledge transfer is cast into a redundant information suppression
formulation. Existing methods introduce sophisticated modules,
architecture-tailored designs, and excessive parameters, which impair their
efficiency and applicability. We propose to extract the architecture-agnostic
knowledge in heterogeneous representations by reducing the redundant
architecture-exclusive information. To this end, we present a simple redundancy
suppression distillation (RSD) loss, which comprises cross-architecture
invariance maximisation and feature decorrelation objectives. To prevent the
student from entirely losing its architecture-specific capabilities, we further
design a lightweight module that decouples the RSD objective from the student's
internal representations. Our method is devoid of the architecture-specific
designs and complex operations in the pioneering method of OFA. It outperforms
OFA on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k benchmarks with only a fraction of their
parameter overhead, which highlights its potential as a simple and strong
baseline to the cross-architecture distillation community.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SMFNet的选择性跨模态融合框架，用于RGB-D视频显著目标检测（VSOD），通过像素级选择性融合策略（PSF）和多维选择性注意力模块（MSAM）优化运动与深度信息的利用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RGB-D VSOD模型在利用光流和深度信息时未考虑其在不同场景中的贡献差异，限制了性能提升。

Method: 提出PSF策略选择性融合光流和深度信息，结合MSAM模块增强特征表示。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了SMFNet的优越性，并建立了最全面的RGB-D VSOD基准。

Conclusion: SMFNet通过选择性融合和注意力机制显著提升了RGB-D VSOD的性能。

Abstract: Applying salient object detection (SOD) to RGB-D videos is an emerging task
called RGB-D VSOD and has recently gained increasing interest, due to
considerable performance gains of incorporating motion and depth and that RGB-D
videos can be easily captured now in daily life. Existing RGB-D VSOD models
have different attempts to derive motion cues, in which extracting motion
information explicitly from optical flow appears to be a more effective and
promising alternative. Despite this, there remains a key issue that how to
effectively utilize optical flow and depth to assist the RGB modality in SOD.
Previous methods always treat optical flow and depth equally with respect to
model designs, without explicitly considering their unequal contributions in
individual scenarios, limiting the potential of motion and depth. To address
this issue and unleash the power of motion and depth, we propose a novel
selective cross-modal fusion framework (SMFNet) for RGB-D VSOD, incorporating a
pixel-level selective fusion strategy (PSF) that achieves optimal fusion of
optical flow and depth based on their actual contributions. Besides, we propose
a multi-dimensional selective attention module (MSAM) to integrate the fused
features derived from PSF with the remaining RGB modality at multiple
dimensions, effectively enhancing feature representation to generate refined
features. We conduct comprehensive evaluation of SMFNet against 19
state-of-the-art models on both RDVS and DVisal datasets, making the evaluation
the most comprehensive RGB-D VSOD benchmark up to date, and it also
demonstrates the superiority of SMFNet over other models. Meanwhile, evaluation
on five video benchmark datasets incorporating synthetic depth validates the
efficacy of SMFNet as well. Our code and benchmark results are made publicly
available at https://github.com/Jia-hao999/SMFNet.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法存在时间不一致性和提示过拟合问题，且计算资源需求高。

Method: 采用运动感知帧重建和提示扰动重建策略，结合元学习的动态损失平衡机制。

Result: 显著提升时间一致性并减少过拟合，同时保持低计算开销。

Conclusion: Vid-TTA为现有视频编辑模型提供了即插即用的性能提升方案。

Abstract: Video editing is a critical component of content creation that transforms raw
footage into coherent works aligned with specific visual and narrative
objectives. Existing approaches face two major challenges: temporal
inconsistencies due to failure in capturing complex motion patterns, and
overfitting to simple prompts arising from limitations in UNet backbone
architectures. While learning-based methods can enhance editing quality, they
typically demand substantial computational resources and are constrained by the
scarcity of high-quality annotated data. In this paper, we present Vid-TTA, a
lightweight test-time adaptation framework that personalizes optimization for
each test video during inference through self-supervised auxiliary tasks. Our
approach incorporates a motion-aware frame reconstruction mechanism that
identifies and preserves crucial movement regions, alongside a prompt
perturbation and reconstruction strategy that strengthens model robustness to
diverse textual descriptions. These innovations are orchestrated by a
meta-learning driven dynamic loss balancing mechanism that adaptively adjusts
the optimization process based on video characteristics. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Vid-TTA significantly improves video temporal consistency and
mitigates prompt overfitting while maintaining low computational overhead,
offering a plug-and-play performance boost for existing video editing models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在利用视觉线索进行消歧时效果不佳，且单一方向假设（如头部到指尖）可能导致性能下降。

Method: 提出双模型框架，分别学习头部到指尖和手腕到指尖的方向，引入高斯射线热图表示，并使用CLIP感知集成模块结合两者优势。

Result: 在YouRefIt数据集上，0.25 IoU阈值下实现了约4 mAP的提升。

Conclusion: 双模型框架和CLIP感知集成模块有效提升了指向性参考理解的性能。

Abstract: We address the problem of Embodied Reference Understanding, which involves
predicting the object that a person in the scene is referring to through both
pointing gesture and language. Accurately identifying the referent requires
multimodal understanding: integrating textual instructions, visual pointing,
and scene context. However, existing methods often struggle to effectively
leverage visual clues for disambiguation. We also observe that, while the
referent is often aligned with the head-to-fingertip line, it occasionally
aligns more closely with the wrist-to-fingertip line. Therefore, relying on a
single line assumption can be overly simplistic and may lead to suboptimal
performance. To address this, we propose a dual-model framework, where one
model learns from the head-to-fingertip direction and the other from the
wrist-to-fingertip direction. We further introduce a Gaussian ray heatmap
representation of these lines and use them as input to provide a strong
supervisory signal that encourages the model to better attend to pointing cues.
To combine the strengths of both models, we present the CLIP-Aware Pointing
Ensemble module, which performs a hybrid ensemble based on CLIP features.
Additionally, we propose an object center prediction head as an auxiliary task
to further enhance referent localization. We validate our approach through
extensive experiments and analysis on the benchmark YouRefIt dataset, achieving
an improvement of approximately 4 mAP at the 0.25 IoU threshold.

Motivation: 解决传统顺序文本到视觉流程的局限性，提供更一致和沉浸式的叙事体验。

Method: 结合Narrator（生成文本和多模态提示）、Director（管理动态场景图）、Narrative Arc Controller（指导故事结构）和Affective Tone Mapper（确保情感一致性）。

Result: 在多样化叙事提示上，Aether Weaver比基线方法在叙事深度、视觉保真度和情感共鸣上表现更优。

Conclusion: 该框架为快速创意原型设计和沉浸式叙事体验提供了强大平台。

Abstract: We introduce Aether Weaver, a novel, integrated framework for multimodal
narrative co-generation that overcomes limitations of sequential text-to-visual
pipelines. Our system concurrently synthesizes textual narratives, dynamic
scene graph representations, visual scenes, and affective soundscapes, driven
by a tightly integrated, co-generation mechanism. At its core, the Narrator, a
large language model, generates narrative text and multimodal prompts, while
the Director acts as a dynamic scene graph manager, and analyzes the text to
build and maintain a structured representation of the story's world, ensuring
spatio-temporal and relational consistency for visual rendering and subsequent
narrative generation. Additionally, a Narrative Arc Controller guides the
high-level story structure, influencing multimodal affective consistency,
further complemented by an Affective Tone Mapper that ensures congruent
emotional expression across all modalities. Through qualitative evaluations on
a diverse set of narrative prompts encompassing various genres, we demonstrate
that Aether Weaver significantly enhances narrative depth, visual fidelity, and
emotional resonance compared to cascaded baseline approaches. This integrated
framework provides a robust platform for rapid creative prototyping and
immersive storytelling experiences.

Motivation: 深度伪造技术对数字媒体真实性构成威胁，现有检测器在真实场景中的有效性尚未验证。

Method: 提出一种模拟真实场景的测试方法，使用先进深度伪造生成技术创建包含50万张高质量深度伪造图像的数据集。

Result: 检测深度伪造仍具挑战性，仅不到一半检测器AUC超过60%，最低为50%，图像处理会显著降低性能。

Conclusion: 深度伪造检测仍需改进，公开代码和数据以促进研究。

Abstract: Deepfakes powered by advanced machine learning models present a significant
and evolving threat to identity verification and the authenticity of digital
media. Although numerous detectors have been developed to address this problem,
their effectiveness has yet to be tested when applied to real-world data. In
this work we evaluate modern deepfake detectors, introducing a novel testing
procedure designed to mimic real-world scenarios for deepfake detection. Using
state-of-the-art deepfake generation methods, we create a comprehensive dataset
containing more than 500,000 high-quality deepfake images. Our analysis shows
that detecting deepfakes still remains a challenging task. The evaluation shows
that in fewer than half of the deepfake detectors tested achieved an AUC score
greater than 60%, with the lowest being 50%. We demonstrate that basic image
manipulations, such as JPEG compression or image enhancement, can significantly
reduce model performance. All code and data are publicly available at

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated success in computational
pathology (CPath) for disease detection, biomarker classification, and
prognosis prediction. However, its potential to learn unintended demographic
biases, particularly those related to social determinants of health, remains
understudied. This study investigates whether deep learning models can predict
self-reported race from digitized dermatopathology slides and identifies
potential morphological shortcuts. Using a multisite dataset with a racially
diverse population, we apply an attention-based mechanism to uncover
race-associated morphological features. After evaluating three dataset curation
strategies to control for confounding factors, the final experiment showed that
White and Black demographic groups retained high prediction performance (AUC:
0.799, 0.762), while overall performance dropped to 0.663. Attention analysis
revealed the epidermis as a key predictive feature, with significant
performance declines when these regions were removed. These findings highlight
the need for careful data curation and bias mitigation to ensure equitable AI
deployment in pathology. Code available at:

Conclusion: ArtSeek能有效解读视觉主题、推断历史背景，并适用于其他需要外部知识的领域，推动可扩展的多模态AI研究。

Abstract: Analyzing digitized artworks presents unique challenges, requiring not only
visual interpretation but also a deep understanding of rich artistic,
contextual, and historical knowledge. We introduce ArtSeek, a multimodal
framework for art analysis that combines multimodal large language models with
retrieval-augmented generation. Unlike prior work, our pipeline relies only on
image input, enabling applicability to artworks without links to Wikidata or
Wikipedia-common in most digitized collections. ArtSeek integrates three key
components: an intelligent multimodal retrieval module based on late
interaction retrieval, a contrastive multitask classification network for
predicting artist, genre, style, media, and tags, and an agentic reasoning
strategy enabled through in-context examples for complex visual question
answering and artwork explanation via Qwen2.5-VL. Central to this approach is
WikiFragments, a Wikipedia-scale dataset of image-text fragments curated to
support knowledge-grounded multimodal reasoning. Our framework achieves
state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, including a +8.4% F1
improvement in style classification over GraphCLIP and a +7.1 BLEU@1 gain in
captioning on ArtPedia. Qualitative analyses show that ArtSeek can interpret
visual motifs, infer historical context, and retrieve relevant knowledge, even
for obscure works. Though focused on visual arts, our approach generalizes to
other domains requiring external knowledge, supporting scalable multimodal AI
research. Both the dataset and the source code will be made publicly available

Result: 在包含16,140张眼底图像的EDID数据集上，SwinECAT实现了88.29%的准确率，加权F1分数0.88，宏F1分数0.90。

Conclusion: SwinECAT在9类眼底疾病分类任务中表现优异，显著优于基线模型，是目前公开数据集上的最高性能。

Abstract: In recent years, artificial intelligence has been increasingly applied in the
field of medical imaging. Among these applications, fundus image analysis
presents special challenges, including small lesion areas in certain fundus
diseases and subtle inter-disease differences, which can lead to reduced
prediction accuracy and overfitting in the models. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes the Transformer-based model SwinECAT, which combines the
Shifted Window (Swin) Attention with the Efficient Channel Attention (ECA)
Attention. SwinECAT leverages the Swin Attention mechanism in the Swin
Transformer backbone to effectively capture local spatial structures and
long-range dependencies within fundus images. The lightweight ECA mechanism is
incorporated to guide the SwinECAT's attention toward critical feature
channels, enabling more discriminative feature representation. In contrast to
previous studies that typically classify fundus images into 4 to 6 categories,
this work expands fundus disease classification to 9 distinct types, thereby
enhancing the granularity of diagnosis. We evaluate our method on the Eye
Disease Image Dataset (EDID) containing 16,140 fundus images for 9-category
classification. Experimental results demonstrate that SwinECAT achieves 88.29\%
accuracy, with weighted F1-score of 0.88 and macro F1-score of 0.90. The
classification results of our proposed model SwinECAT significantly outperform
the baseline Swin Transformer and multiple compared baseline models. To our
knowledge, this represents the highest reported performance for 9-category
classification on this public dataset.

Motivation: 多模态领域缺乏大规模高质量的代理调优数据集，限制了多模态大模型的潜力。

Method: 通过四阶段数据引擎构建MMAT-1M数据集：1) 收集公开多模态问答对；2) 利用GPT-4o生成理性并动态整合API调用和RAG信息；3) 通过反思优化理性；4) 可选压缩为单轮格式。

Result: InternVL2.5-8B-RR模型在多个基准测试中平均提升2.7%，在Dyn-VQA上提升8.8%。

Conclusion: MMAT-1M有效增强多模态推理和工具使用能力，数据集已公开。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), enhanced through agent tuning, have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and tool
utilization, significantly surpassing the performance of standalone models.
However, the multimodal domain still lacks a large-scale, high-quality agent
tuning dataset to unlock the full potential of multimodal large language
models. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMAT-1M, the first million-scale
multimodal agent tuning dataset designed to support CoT, reflection, and
dynamic tool usage. Our dataset is constructed through a novel four-stage data
engine: 1) We first curate publicly available multimodal datasets containing
question-answer pairs; 2) Then, leveraging GPT-4o, we generate rationales for
the original question-answer pairs and dynamically integrate API calls and
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) information through a multi-turn paradigm;
3) Furthermore, we refine the rationales through reflection to ensure logical
consistency and accuracy, creating a multi-turn dialogue dataset with both
Rationale and Reflection (RR); 4) Finally, to enhance efficiency, we optionally
compress multi-turn dialogues into a One-turn Rationale and Reflection (ORR)
format. By fine-tuning open-source multimodal models on the MMAT-1M, we observe
significant performance gains. For instance, the InternVL2.5-8B-RR model
achieves an average improvement of 2.7% across eight public benchmarks and 8.8%
on the RAG benchmark Dyn-VQA, demonstrating the dataset's effectiveness in
enhancing multimodal reasoning and tool-based capabilities. The dataset is

Method: LMAC-Net引入多模态注意力一致性机制，包括多模态局部查询编码模块和两级评分评估，联合优化多模态对齐和评分融合。

Result: 在RG和Fis-V数据集上的实验表明，LMAC-Net显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LMAC-Net通过多模态对齐和增强特征表示，有效解决了长期动作质量评估的挑战。

Abstract: Long-term action quality assessment (AQA) focuses on evaluating the quality
of human activities in videos lasting up to several minutes. This task plays an
important role in the automated evaluation of artistic sports such as rhythmic
gymnastics and figure skating, where both accurate motion execution and
temporal synchronization with background music are essential for performance
assessment. However, existing methods predominantly fall into two categories:
unimodal approaches that rely solely on visual features, which are inadequate
for modeling multimodal cues like music; and multimodal approaches that
typically employ simple feature-level contrastive fusion, overlooking deep
cross-modal collaboration and temporal dynamics. As a result, they struggle to
capture complex interactions between modalities and fail to accurately track
critical performance changes throughout extended sequences. To address these
challenges, we propose the Long-term Multimodal Attention Consistency Network
(LMAC-Net). LMAC-Net introduces a multimodal attention consistency mechanism to
explicitly align multimodal features, enabling stable integration of visual and
audio information and enhancing feature representations. Specifically, we
introduce a multimodal local query encoder module to capture temporal semantics
and cross-modal relations, and use a two-level score evaluation for
interpretable results. In addition, attention-based and regression-based losses
are applied to jointly optimize multimodal alignment and score fusion.
Experiments conducted on the RG and Fis-V datasets demonstrate that LMAC-Net
significantly outperforms existing methods, validating the effectiveness of our
proposed approach.

limited calibration data, especially under privacy constraints. Data-free
quantization (DFQ) mitigates this by generating synthetic images using
generative models such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and
text-conditioned latent diffusion models (LDMs), while applying existing PTQ
algorithms. However, the relationship between generated synthetic images and
the generalizability of the quantized model during PTQ remains underexplored.
Without investigating this relationship, synthetic images generated by previous
prompt engineering methods based on single-class prompts suffer from issues
such as polysemy, leading to performance degradation. We propose
\textbf{mixup-class prompt}, a mixup-based text prompting strategy that fuses
multiple class labels at the text prompt level to generate diverse, robust
synthetic data. This approach enhances generalization, and improves
optimization stability in PTQ. We provide quantitative insights through
gradient norm and generalization error analysis. Experiments on convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) show that our method
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art DFQ methods like GenQ. Furthermore,
it pushes the performance boundary in extremely low-bit scenarios, achieving
new state-of-the-art accuracy in challenging 2-bit weight, 4-bit activation
(W2A4) quantization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有阴影去除方法依赖难以获取的阴影掩码，而基于局部对比信息的替代方法在复杂场景中易受模糊性限制。

Method: 采用AGBA动态过滤和重加权对比先验，结合FCFN利用高频和对比线索引导生成过程。

Result: 在无掩码方法中达到最优性能，与基于掩码的方法竞争。

Conclusion: AGBA和FCFN有效解决了阴影去除中的复杂场景挑战，性能优越。

Abstract: Existing shadow removal methods often rely on shadow masks, which are
challenging to acquire in real-world scenarios. Exploring intrinsic image cues,
such as local contrast information, presents a potential alternative for
guiding shadow removal in the absence of explicit masks. However, the cue's
inherent ambiguity becomes a critical limitation in complex scenes, where it
can fail to distinguish true shadows from low-reflectance objects and intricate
background textures. To address this motivation, we propose the Adaptive Gated
Dual-Branch Attention (AGBA) mechanism. AGBA dynamically filters and re-weighs
the contrast prior to effectively disentangle shadow features from confounding
visual elements. Furthermore, to tackle the persistent challenge of restoring
soft shadow boundaries and fine-grained details, we introduce a diffusion-based
Frequency-Contrast Fusion Network (FCFN) that leverages high-frequency and
contrast cues to guide the generative process. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results among mask-free
approaches while maintaining competitive performance relative to mask-based
methods.

Motivation: 工业烟雾等领域像素级标签稀缺且标注困难，现有弱监督方法因监督差距和模型偏差导致前景覆盖不全、边界不准确等问题。

Method: 采用教师-学生框架结合CNN和ViT，引入知识转移损失实现跨架构一致性，并加入后处理技术提升伪掩码质量。

Result: 新框架直接针对共现问题，无需外部监督，改善了伪掩码的覆盖率和准确性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了弱监督语义分割中的共现偏差问题，提升了工业烟雾等领域的应用效果。

Abstract: Scarcity of pixel-level labels is a significant challenge in practical
scenarios. In specific domains like industrial smoke, acquiring such detailed
annotations is particularly difficult and often requires expert knowledge. To
alleviate this, weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) has emerged as a
promising approach. However, due to the supervision gap and inherent bias in
models trained with only image level labels, existing WSSS methods suffer from
limitations such as incomplete foreground coverage, inaccurate object
boundaries, and spurious correlations, especially in our domain, where
emissions are always spatially coupled with chimneys.
  Previous solutions typically rely on additional priors or external knowledge
to mitigate these issues, but they often lack scalability and fail to address
the model's inherent bias toward co-occurring context. To address this, we
propose a novel WSSS framework that directly targets the co-occurrence problem
without relying on external supervision. Unlike prior methods that adopt a
single network, we employ a teacher-student framework that combines CNNs and
ViTs. We introduce a knowledge transfer loss that enforces cross-architecture
consistency by aligning internal representations. Additionally, we incorporate
post-processing techniques to address partial coverage and further improve
pseudo mask quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖精确姿态信息，但实际场景中姿态获取成本高且易受噪声影响，限制了方法的实用性。

Method: 扩展视角域重建预训练到全景域，引入RoPE rolling机制建模全景图像的水平周期性。

Result: PanoSplatt3R在无姿态信息下，生成高质量新视图和深度估计精度均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PanoSplatt3R展示了无需姿态信息的全景重建潜力，具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Wide-baseline panorama reconstruction has emerged as a highly effective and
pivotal approach for not only achieving geometric reconstruction of the
surrounding 3D environment, but also generating highly realistic and immersive
novel views. Although existing methods have shown remarkable performance across
various benchmarks, they are predominantly reliant on accurate pose
information. In real-world scenarios, the acquisition of precise pose often
requires additional computational resources and is highly susceptible to noise.
These limitations hinder the broad applicability and practicality of such
methods. In this paper, we present PanoSplatt3R, an unposed wide-baseline
panorama reconstruction method. We extend and adapt the foundational
reconstruction pretrainings from the perspective domain to the panoramic
domain, thus enabling powerful generalization capabilities. To ensure a
seamless and efficient domain-transfer process, we introduce RoPE rolling that
spans rolled coordinates in rotary positional embeddings across different
attention heads, maintaining a minimal modification to RoPE's mechanism, while
modeling the horizontal periodicity of panorama images. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that PanoSplatt3R, even in the absence of pose
information, significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. This
superiority is evident in both the generation of high-quality novel views and
the accuracy of depth estimation, thereby showcasing its great potential for
practical applications. Project page: https://npucvr.github.io/PanoSplatt3R

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心血管疾病是全球主要死因，早期检测至关重要。心电图图像在临床中广泛存储，但人工解读耗时且依赖专家知识。

Result: 在公开验证集和私有测试集上分别获得0.9688和0.9677的AUROC分数。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在临床工作流中自动化心电图解读的潜力。

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading global cause of death, and
early detection is essential to improve patient outcomes. Electrocardiograms
(ECGs), especially 12-lead ECGs, play a key role in the identification of CVDs.
These are routinely interpreted by human experts, a process that is
time-consuming and requires expert knowledge. Historical research in this area
has focused on automatic ECG interpretation from digital signals, with recent
deep learning approaches achieving strong results. In practice, however, most
ECG data in clinical practice are stored or shared in image form. To bridge
this gap, we propose a deep learning framework designed specifically to
classify paper-like ECG images into five main diagnostic categories. Our method
was the winning entry to the 2024 British Heart Foundation Open Data Science
Challenge. It addresses two main challenges of paper ECG classification: visual
noise (e.g., shadows or creases) and the need to detect fine-detailed waveform
patterns. We propose a pre-processing pipeline that reduces visual noise and a
two-stage fine-tuning strategy: the model is first fine-tuned on synthetic and
external ECG image datasets to learn domain-specific features, and then further
fine-tuned on the target dataset to enhance disease-specific recognition. We
adopt the ConvNeXt architecture as the backbone of our model. Our method
achieved AUROC scores of 0.9688 on the public validation set and 0.9677 on the
private test set of the British Heart Foundation Open Data Science Challenge,
highlighting its potential as a practical tool for automated ECG interpretation
in clinical workflows.

Motivation: 事件相机具有高动态范围和精细时间分辨率，但在语义分割任务中面临稀疏噪声事件流与密集图像数据融合的挑战。

Method: EIFNet结合事件和图像输入，采用自适应事件特征优化模块（AEFRM）、模态自适应重校准模块（MARM）和多头注意力门控融合模块（MGFM）。

Result: 在DDD17-Semantic和DSEC-Semantic数据集上，EIFNet实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: EIFNet通过多模态融合和注意力机制，有效提升了事件相机语义分割的性能。

Abstract: Event-based semantic segmentation explores the potential of event cameras,
which offer high dynamic range and fine temporal resolution, to achieve robust
scene understanding in challenging environments. Despite these advantages, the
task remains difficult due to two main challenges: extracting reliable features
from sparse and noisy event streams, and effectively fusing them with dense,
semantically rich image data that differ in structure and representation. To
address these issues, we propose EIFNet, a multi-modal fusion network that
combines the strengths of both event and frame-based inputs. The network
includes an Adaptive Event Feature Refinement Module (AEFRM), which improves
event representations through multi-scale activity modeling and spatial
attention. In addition, we introduce a Modality-Adaptive Recalibration Module
(MARM) and a Multi-Head Attention Gated Fusion Module (MGFM), which align and
integrate features across modalities using attention mechanisms and gated
fusion strategies. Experiments on DDD17-Semantic and DSEC-Semantic datasets
show that EIFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its
effectiveness in event-based semantic segmentation.

Motivation: 现有微动作识别方法常忽略微动作中的细微变化，导致识别精度受限。

Method: 设计了运动引导骨骼调制模块（MSM）和运动引导时间调制模块（MTM），分别从骨骼和帧级别注入运动线索，并提出运动一致性学习策略。

Result: 在Micro-Action 52和iMiGUE数据集上，MMN取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 显式建模细微运动线索对微动作识别至关重要。

Abstract: Micro-Actions (MAs) are an important form of non-verbal communication in
social interactions, with potential applications in human emotional analysis.
However, existing methods in Micro-Action Recognition often overlook the
inherent subtle changes in MAs, which limits the accuracy of distinguishing MAs
with subtle changes. To address this issue, we present a novel Motion-guided
Modulation Network (MMN) that implicitly captures and modulates subtle motion
cues to enhance spatial-temporal representation learning. Specifically, we
introduce a Motion-guided Skeletal Modulation module (MSM) to inject motion
cues at the skeletal level, acting as a control signal to guide spatial
representation modeling. In parallel, we design a Motion-guided Temporal
Modulation module (MTM) to incorporate motion information at the frame level,
facilitating the modeling of holistic motion patterns in micro-actions.
Finally, we propose a motion consistency learning strategy to aggregate the
motion cues from multi-scale features for micro-action classification.
Experimental results on the Micro-Action 52 and iMiGUE datasets demonstrate
that MMN achieves state-of-the-art performance in skeleton-based micro-action
recognition, underscoring the importance of explicitly modeling subtle motion
cues. The code will be available at https://github.com/momiji-bit/MMN.

Method: 提出ZIUM方法，支持零样本对抗攻击，无需额外优化即可定制攻击内容。

Result: ZIUM在多种场景下表现出色，攻击成功率高且时间成本低。

Conclusion: ZIUM为机器遗忘模型的安全研究提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) removes specific data points or concepts from deep
learning models to enhance privacy and prevent sensitive content generation.
Adversarial prompts can exploit unlearned models to generate content containing
removed concepts, posing a significant security risk. However, existing
adversarial attack methods still face challenges in generating content that
aligns with an attacker's intent while incurring high computational costs to
identify successful prompts. To address these challenges, we propose ZIUM, a
Zero-shot Intent-aware adversarial attack on Unlearned Models, which enables
the flexible customization of target attack images to reflect an attacker's
intent. Additionally, ZIUM supports zero-shot adversarial attacks without
requiring further optimization for previously attacked unlearned concepts. The
evaluation across various MU scenarios demonstrated ZIUM's effectiveness in
successfully customizing content based on user-intent prompts while achieving a
superior attack success rate compared to existing methods. Moreover, its
zero-shot adversarial attack significantly reduces the attack time for
previously attacked unlearned concepts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保护计算机视觉模型的知识产权，防止未经授权的使用。

Method: 通过直接修改少量模型权重实现染色和锁定，锁定模型需在输入图像中插入触发补丁解锁。

Result: 实验证明该方法有效，对模型性能影响小，且具有可证明的最坏情况误报率。

Conclusion: 该方法为保护预训练模型提供了高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce new methods of staining and locking computer vision models, to
protect their owners' intellectual property. Staining, also known as
watermarking, embeds secret behaviour into a model which can later be used to
identify it, while locking aims to make a model unusable unless a secret
trigger is inserted into input images. Unlike existing methods, our algorithms
can be used to stain and lock pre-trained models without requiring fine-tuning
or retraining, and come with provable, computable guarantees bounding their
worst-case false positive rates. The stain and lock are implemented by directly
modifying a small number of the model's weights and have minimal impact on the
(unlocked) model's performance. Locked models are unlocked by inserting a small
`trigger patch' into the corner of the input image. We present experimental
results showing the efficacy of our methods and demonstrating their practical
performance on a variety of computer vision models.

Result: 在SMOKE5K和IJmond数据集上，F1分数和IoU分别提升5倍和6倍。

Conclusion: 验证了公民科学与弱监督域适应结合的可扩展性和成本效益。

Abstract: Industrial smoke segmentation is critical for air-quality monitoring and
environmental protection but is often hampered by the high cost and scarcity of
pixel-level annotations in real-world settings. We introduce CEDANet, a
human-in-the-loop, class-aware domain adaptation framework that uniquely
integrates weak, citizen-provided video-level labels with adversarial feature
alignment. Specifically, we refine pseudo-labels generated by a source-trained
segmentation model using citizen votes, and employ class-specific domain
discriminators to transfer rich source-domain representations to the industrial
domain. Comprehensive experiments on SMOKE5K and custom IJmond datasets
demonstrate that CEDANet achieves an F1-score of 0.414 and a smoke-class IoU of
0.261 with citizen feedback, vastly outperforming the baseline model, which
scored 0.083 and 0.043 respectively. This represents a five-fold increase in
F1-score and a six-fold increase in smoke-class IoU. Notably, CEDANet with
citizen-constrained pseudo-labels achieves performance comparable to the same
architecture trained on limited 100 fully annotated images with F1-score of
0.418 and IoU of 0.264, demonstrating its ability to reach small-sampled fully
supervised-level accuracy without target-domain annotations. Our research
validates the scalability and cost-efficiency of combining citizen science with
weakly supervised domain adaptation, offering a practical solution for complex,
data-scarce environmental monitoring applications.

Conclusion: ViHallu有效缓解幻觉现象，并发布了专门的数据集ViHallu-Instruction以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in visual understanding and multimodal reasoning. However, LVLMs
frequently exhibit hallucination phenomena, manifesting as the generated
textual responses that demonstrate inconsistencies with the provided visual
content. Existing hallucination mitigation methods are predominantly
text-centric, the challenges of visual-semantic alignment significantly limit
their effectiveness, especially when confronted with fine-grained visual
understanding scenarios. To this end, this paper presents ViHallu, a
Vision-Centric Hallucination mitigation framework that enhances visual-semantic
alignment through Visual Variation Image Generation and Visual Instruction
Construction. ViHallu introduces \textbf{\textit{visual variation images}} with
controllable visual alterations while maintaining the overall image structure.
These images, combined with carefully constructed visual instructions, enable
LVLMs to better understand fine-grained visual content through fine-tuning,
allowing models to more precisely capture the correspondence between visual
content and text, thereby enhancing visual-semantic alignment. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks show that ViHallu effectively enhances
models' fine-grained visual understanding while significantly reducing
hallucination tendencies. Furthermore, we release ViHallu-Instruction, a visual
instruction dataset specifically designed for hallucination mitigation and
visual-semantic alignment. Code is available at

Motivation: 验证密集音频-视觉模型在低资源、多语言环境中的有效性，特别是在标注和音频质量较差的情况下。

Method: 比较三种对比目标函数：全局均值池化（CLIP风格）、密集最大-均值令牌匹配（DenseAV风格）和混合方法。

Result: 密集目标函数在音频-视觉检索中相对R@1提升59%，并生成更清晰的零样本定位热图。

Conclusion: 密集令牌路由在低资源环境中更为关键，且无需调整视觉骨干网络。

Abstract: Recent dense audio-visual (AV) models achieve impressive retrieval and
emergent localization, but almost all evidence comes from English-centric,
caption-rich web video. It is unclear whether these objectives survive in
low-resource, code-switched, and noisy multilingual settings that typify
developing regions. We show they do**-**and that the choice of aggregation
function becomes even more critical. Using a multilingual subset of Project
Vaani spanning dozens of Indian languages and dialectal variants, we compare
three contrastive objectives: (i) a global mean-pooled loss (CLIP-style), (ii)
a dense max-mean token matcher (DenseAV-style), and (iii) a simple hybrid
(motivated by frozen-vision alignment strategies). The dense objective delivers
a +59% relative R@1 (Audio Visual) improvement over global pooling and
substantially lower mean/median ranks, while consistently producing sharp
zero-shot localization heatmaps of spoken objects-despite keeping the vision
backbone entirely frozen (no LoRA / partial fine-tuning). Our results
demonstrate that dense token routing is not a luxury of high-resource English
corpora; it is more decisive when annotations and acoustic cleanliness are
scarce. We release the codebase and trained models.

Abstract: We propose a novel segmentation-based explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) method for neural networks working on point cloud classification. As one
building block of this method, we propose a novel point-shifting mechanism to
introduce perturbations in point cloud data. Recently, AI has seen an
exponential growth. Hence, it is important to understand the decision-making
process of AI algorithms when they are applied in critical areas. Our work
focuses on explaining AI algorithms that classify point cloud data. An
important aspect of the methods used for explaining AI algorithms is their
ability to produce explanations that are easy for humans to understand. This
allows them to analyze the AI algorithms better and make appropriate decisions
based on that analysis. Therefore, in this work, we intend to generate
meaningful explanations that can be easily interpreted by humans. The point
cloud data we consider represents 3D objects such as cars, guitars, and
laptops. We make use of point cloud segmentation models to generate
explanations for the working of classification models. The segments are used to
introduce perturbations into the input point cloud data and generate saliency
maps. The perturbations are introduced using the novel point-shifting mechanism
proposed in this work which ensures that the shifted points no longer influence
the output of the classification algorithm. In contrast to previous methods,
the segments used by our method are meaningful, i.e. humans can easily
interpret the meaning of the segments. Thus, the benefit of our method over
other methods is its ability to produce more meaningful saliency maps. We
compare our method with the use of classical clustering algorithms to generate
explanations. We also analyze the saliency maps generated for example inputs
using our method to demonstrate the usefulness of the method in generating
meaningful explanations.

Conclusion: 浅层网络通过优化特征编码和位置信息处理，能够实现高性能，验证了研究假设。

Abstract: Deep learning has witnessed the extensive utilization across a wide spectrum
of domains, including fine-grained few-shot learning (FGFSL) which heavily
depends on deep backbones. Nonetheless, shallower deep backbones such as
ConvNet-4, are not commonly preferred because they're prone to extract a larger
quantity of non-abstract visual attributes. In this paper, we initially
re-evaluate the relationship between network depth and the ability to fully
encode few-shot instances, and delve into whether shallow deep architecture
could effectuate comparable or superior performance to mainstream deep
backbone. Fueled by the inspiration from vanilla ConvNet-4, we introduce a
location-aware constellation network (LCN-4), equipped with a cutting-edge
location-aware feature clustering module. This module can proficiently encoder
and integrate spatial feature fusion, feature clustering, and recessive feature
location, thereby significantly minimizing the overall loss. Specifically, we
innovatively put forward a general grid position encoding compensation to
effectively address the issue of positional information missing during the
feature extraction process of specific ordinary convolutions. Additionally, we
further propose a general frequency domain location embedding technique to
offset for the location loss in clustering features. We have carried out
validation procedures on three representative fine-grained few-shot benchmarks.
Relevant experiments have established that LCN-4 notably outperforms the
ConvNet-4 based State-of-the-Arts and achieves performance that is on par with
or superior to most ResNet12-based methods, confirming the correctness of our
conjecture.

Method: MetaLab包含两个协作神经网络：LabNet（用于CIELab颜色空间转换和特征提取）和LabGNN（促进亮度图与颜色图之间的相互学习）。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，MetaLab实现了高准确率（接近99%）、鲁棒性能和有效泛化能力。

Abstract: Difficult few-shot image recognition has significant application prospects,
yet remaining the substantial technical gaps with the conventional large-scale
image recognition. In this paper, we have proposed an efficient original method
for few-shot image recognition, called CIELab-Guided Coherent Meta-Learning
(MetaLab). Structurally, our MetaLab comprises two collaborative neural
networks: LabNet, which can perform domain transformation for the CIELab color
space and extract rich grouped features, and coherent LabGNN, which can
facilitate mutual learning between lightness graph and color graph. For
sufficient certification, we have implemented extensive comparative studies on
four coarse-grained benchmarks, four fine-grained benchmarks, and four
cross-domain few-shot benchmarks. Specifically, our method can achieve high
accuracy, robust performance, and effective generalization capability with
one-shot sample per class. Overall, all experiments have demonstrated that our
MetaLab can approach 99\% $\uparrow\downarrow$ accuracy, reaching the human
recognition ceiling with little visual deviation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过强化学习改进离散自回归模型的方法X-Omni，解决了图像生成中的视觉保真度低和指令遵循问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于离散令牌的自回归图像生成方法存在视觉保真度低、输出扭曲和复杂指令遵循困难的问题，作者希望通过强化学习改进这些问题。

Method: 提出X-Omni框架，包括语义图像标记器、统一的自回归模型和离线扩散解码器，结合强化学习优化生成质量。

Result: X-Omni在图像生成任务中达到SOTA性能，生成高质量图像并具备良好的指令遵循和长文本渲染能力。

Conclusion: 强化学习能有效提升离散自回归模型的图像生成质量，X-Omni实现了图像与语言生成的无缝集成。

Abstract: Numerous efforts have been made to extend the ``next token prediction''
paradigm to visual contents, aiming to create a unified approach for both image
generation and understanding. Nevertheless, attempts to generate images through
autoregressive modeling with discrete tokens have been plagued by issues such
as low visual fidelity, distorted outputs, and failure to adhere to complex
instructions when rendering intricate details. These shortcomings are likely
attributed to cumulative errors during autoregressive inference or information
loss incurred during the discretization process. Probably due to this
challenge, recent research has increasingly shifted toward jointly training
image generation with diffusion objectives and language generation with
autoregressive objectives, moving away from unified modeling approaches. In
this work, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning can effectively mitigate
artifacts and largely enhance the generation quality of a discrete
autoregressive modeling method, thereby enabling seamless integration of image
and language generation. Our framework comprises a semantic image tokenizer, a
unified autoregressive model for both language and images, and an offline
diffusion decoder for image generation, termed X-Omni. X-Omni achieves
state-of-the-art performance in image generation tasks using a 7B language
model, producing images with high aesthetic quality while exhibiting strong
capabilities in following instructions and rendering long texts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StepAL是一种针对手术视频步骤识别的主动学习框架，通过全视频选择和熵加权聚类策略，减少标注成本并提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主动学习方法在手术视频中效果不佳，因为其依赖单帧或短片段标注，而手术步骤识别需要完整视频上下文。

Method: StepAL结合了步骤感知特征表示和熵加权聚类策略，优先选择不确定且步骤多样化的视频进行标注。

Result: 在Cataract-1k和Cataract-101数据集上，StepAL表现优于现有方法，以更少的标注视频实现更高准确性。

Conclusion: StepAL为手术视频分析提供了一种高效方法，降低了计算机辅助手术系统的开发标注负担。

Abstract: Active learning (AL) can reduce annotation costs in surgical video analysis
while maintaining model performance. However, traditional AL methods, developed
for images or short video clips, are suboptimal for surgical step recognition
due to inter-step dependencies within long, untrimmed surgical videos. These
methods typically select individual frames or clips for labeling, which is
ineffective for surgical videos where annotators require the context of the
entire video for annotation. To address this, we propose StepAL, an active
learning framework designed for full video selection in surgical step
recognition. StepAL integrates a step-aware feature representation, which
leverages pseudo-labels to capture the distribution of predicted steps within
each video, with an entropy-weighted clustering strategy. This combination
prioritizes videos that are both uncertain and exhibit diverse step
compositions for annotation. Experiments on two cataract surgery datasets
(Cataract-1k and Cataract-101) demonstrate that StepAL consistently outperforms
existing active learning approaches, achieving higher accuracy in step
recognition with fewer labeled videos. StepAL offers an effective approach for
efficient surgical video analysis, reducing the annotation burden in developing
computer-assisted surgical systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FSVOS方法主要关注静态对象类别，忽略了视频中的动态运动模式，限制了其在需要运动理解的场景中的应用。

Method: 提出了Decoupled Motion Appearance Network (DMA)作为基线方法，并在MOVE数据集上评估了6种现有方法。

Result: 实验表明，现有方法在运动引导FSVOS任务上表现不佳，而DMA方法在少样本运动理解上表现优越。

Conclusion: MOVE数据集和DMA方法为未来运动引导FSVOS研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: This work addresses motion-guided few-shot video object segmentation (FSVOS),
which aims to segment dynamic objects in videos based on a few annotated
examples with the same motion patterns. Existing FSVOS datasets and methods
typically focus on object categories, which are static attributes that ignore
the rich temporal dynamics in videos, limiting their application in scenarios
requiring motion understanding. To fill this gap, we introduce MOVE, a
large-scale dataset specifically designed for motion-guided FSVOS. Based on
MOVE, we comprehensively evaluate 6 state-of-the-art methods from 3 different
related tasks across 2 experimental settings. Our results reveal that current
methods struggle to address motion-guided FSVOS, prompting us to analyze the
associated challenges and propose a baseline method, Decoupled Motion
Appearance Network (DMA). Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior performance in few shot motion understanding, establishing a solid
foundation for future research in this direction.

TL;DR: MetaCLIP 2提出了一种新方法，通过全球网络规模的图像-文本对从头训练CLIP，解决了多语言数据处理的挑战，并在多语言基准测试中取得了新的最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP模型在非英语世界数据处理和多语言性能上存在不足，MetaCLIP 2旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 通过最小化必要调整的严格消融实验，提出了一种从英语和非英语数据中互惠的配方。

Result: 在零样本ImageNet分类中超越现有模型，并在多语言基准测试中创下新纪录。

Conclusion: MetaCLIP 2在多语言环境下表现出色，为CLIP模型的扩展提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) is a popular foundation model,
supporting from zero-shot classification, retrieval to encoders for multimodal
large language models (MLLMs). Although CLIP is successfully trained on
billion-scale image-text pairs from the English world, scaling CLIP's training
further to learning from the worldwide web data is still challenging: (1) no
curation method is available to handle data points from non-English world; (2)
the English performance from existing multilingual CLIP is worse than its
English-only counterpart, i.e., "curse of multilinguality" that is common in
LLMs. Here, we present MetaCLIP 2, the first recipe training CLIP from scratch
on worldwide web-scale image-text pairs. To generalize our findings, we conduct
rigorous ablations with minimal changes that are necessary to address the above
challenges and present a recipe enabling mutual benefits from English and
non-English world data. In zero-shot ImageNet classification, MetaCLIP 2
ViT-H/14 surpasses its English-only counterpart by 0.8% and mSigLIP by 0.7%,
and surprisingly sets new state-of-the-art without system-level confounding
factors (e.g., translation, bespoke architecture changes) on multilingual
benchmarks, such as CVQA with 57.4%, Babel-ImageNet with 50.2% and XM3600 with
64.3% on image-to-text retrieval.

Motivation: 在音频处理中，短片段可能包含数百万样本，选择合适的归纳偏置对机器学习模型设计至关重要。

Method: 提出combolutional layer，结合学习延迟的IIR梳状滤波器和融合包络检测器，在时域提取谐波特征。

Result: 在三个信息检索任务中验证了其有效性，计算成本较低，且具有参数少、CPU推理高效、纯实数计算和可解释性强的优势。

Conclusion: combolutional layer可替代卷积层，适用于钢琴转录、说话人分类和音调检测等任务。

Abstract: Selecting appropriate inductive biases is an essential step in the design of
machine learning models, especially when working with audio, where even short
clips may contain millions of samples. To this end, we propose the
combolutional layer: a learned-delay IIR comb filter and fused envelope
detector, which extracts harmonic features in the time domain. We demonstrate
the efficacy of the combolutional layer on three information retrieval tasks,
evaluate its computational cost relative to other audio frontends, and provide
efficient implementations for training. We find that the combolutional layer is
an effective replacement for convolutional layers in audio tasks where precise
harmonic analysis is important, e.g., piano transcription, speaker
classification, and key detection. Additionally, the combolutional layer has
several other key benefits over existing frontends, namely: low parameter
count, efficient CPU inference, strictly real-valued computations, and improved
interpretability.

Result: 主观可懂度、发音和音质高度相关；客观测量与主观评估一致。

Conclusion: 单一可懂度测量可能足以用于头颈癌患者的临床监测。

Abstract: Meaningful speech assessment is vital in clinical phonetics and therapy
monitoring. This study examined the link between perceptual speech assessments
and objective acoustic measures in a large head and neck cancer (HNC) dataset.
Trained listeners provided ratings of intelligibility, articulation, voice
quality, phonation, speech rate, nasality, and background noise on speech.
Strong correlations were found between subjective intelligibility,
articulation, and voice quality, likely due to a shared underlying cause of
speech symptoms in our speaker population. Objective measures of
intelligibility and speech rate aligned with their subjective counterpart. Our
results suggest that a single intelligibility measure may be sufficient for the
clinical monitoring of speakers treated for HNC using concomitant
chemoradiation.

Abstract: As speech generation technology advances, the risk of misuse through deepfake
audio has become a pressing concern, which underscores the critical need for
robust detection systems. However, many existing speech deepfake datasets are
limited in scale and diversity, making it challenging to train models that can
generalize well to unseen deepfakes. To address these gaps, we introduce
SpeechFake, a large-scale dataset designed specifically for speech deepfake
detection. SpeechFake includes over 3 million deepfake samples, totaling more
than 3,000 hours of audio, generated using 40 different speech synthesis tools.
The dataset encompasses a wide range of generation techniques, including
text-to-speech, voice conversion, and neural vocoder, incorporating the latest
cutting-edge methods. It also provides multilingual support, spanning 46
languages. In this paper, we offer a detailed overview of the dataset's
creation, composition, and statistics. We also present baseline results by
training detection models on SpeechFake, demonstrating strong performance on
both its own test sets and various unseen test sets. Additionally, we conduct
experiments to rigorously explore how generation methods, language diversity,
and speaker variation affect detection performance. We believe SpeechFake will
be a valuable resource for advancing speech deepfake detection and developing
more robust models for evolving generation techniques.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模语音数据集中存在不良特征（如多说话者、非目标语言和音乐），可能影响模型学习。需要一种高效的多任务方法来识别和过滤这些样本。

Method: Whilter模型结合Whisper编码器和注意力分类器，同时解决五个分类问题。

Result: Whilter在三个子任务中F1分数超过85%，错误率6.5%-7.8%，优于BEATs分类器，且处理时间更短。

Conclusion: Whilter是一种高效的多任务模型，适用于语音数据集中的不良样本识别，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Large-scale in-the-wild speech datasets have become more prevalent in recent
years due to increased interest in models that can learn useful features from
unlabelled data for tasks such as speech recognition or synthesis. These
datasets often contain undesirable features, such as multiple speakers,
non-target languages, and music, which may impact model learning. The Whilter
model is proposed as a multitask solution to identify these undesirable
samples. Whilter uses a Whisper encoder with an attention-based classifier to
solve five diverse classification problems at once. In addition, an annotated
dataset is published for a subset of two popular in-the-wild corpora. Whilter
achieves F1 scores above 85% and equal error rates of 6.5% to 7.8% for three of
five subtasks, outperforming a state-of-the-art BEATs classifier on
speech-specific classes, with a notable decrease in processing time compared to
a combination of single-task alternatives.

Motivation: 现有模拟方法难以捕捉人类驾驶员的自适应行为，且多聚焦车队优化而非私人驾驶员的长距离充电需求。

Method: 采用多阶段强化学习框架，模拟大地理范围内的充电需求，并通过真实数据验证。

Result: 模型成功捕捉私人驾驶员的自适应行为和有限理性，并识别出充电需求低的“充电荒漠”。

Conclusion: 研究支持政策向高速公路走廊和城市边界扩展快速充电枢纽，以满足长距离出行需求。

Abstract: Despite the rapid expansion of electric vehicle (EV) charging networks,
questions remain about their efficiency in meeting the growing needs of EV
drivers. Previous simulation-based approaches, which rely on static behavioural
rules, have struggled to capture the adaptive behaviours of human drivers.
Although reinforcement learning has been introduced in EV simulation studies,
its application has primarily focused on optimising fleet operations rather
than modelling private drivers who make independent charging decisions.
Additionally, long-distance travel remains a primary concern for EV drivers.
However, existing simulation studies rarely explore charging behaviour over
large geographical scales. To address these gaps, we propose a multi-stage
reinforcement learning framework that simulates EV charging demand across large
geographical areas. We validate the model against real-world data, and identify
the training stage that most closely reflects actual driver behaviour, which
captures both the adaptive behaviours and bounded rationality of private
drivers. Based on the simulation results, we also identify critical 'charging
deserts' where EV drivers consistently have low state of charge. Our findings
also highlight recent policy shifts toward expanding rapid charging hubs along
motorway corridors and city boundaries to meet the demand from long-distance
trips.

Abstract: This study uses agent-based modeling to examine the impact of various
recommendation algorithms on the propagation of misinformation on online social
networks. We simulate a synthetic environment consisting of heterogeneous
agents, including regular users, bots, and influencers, interacting through a
social network with recommendation systems. We evaluate four recommendation
strategies: popularity-based, collaborative filtering, and content-based
filtering, along with a random baseline. Our results show that
popularity-driven algorithms significantly amplify misinformation, while
item-based collaborative filtering and content-based approaches are more
effective in limiting exposure to fake content. Item-based collaborative
filtering was found to perform better than previously reported in related
literature. These findings highlight the role of algorithm design in shaping
online information exposure and show that agent-based modeling can be used to
gain realistic insight into how misinformation spreads.

Abstract: Recently, the field of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) has gained popularity as
researchers are trying to develop artificial intelligence capable of efficient
collective reasoning. Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well
in isolated tasks, yet struggle with higher-order cognition required for
adaptive collaboration. Human teams achieve synergy not only through knowledge
sharing, but also through recursive reasoning, structured critique, and the
ability to infer others' mental states. Current artificial systems lack these
essential mechanisms, limiting their ability to engage in sophisticated
collective reasoning. This work explores cognitive processes that enable
effective collaboration, focusing on adaptive theory of mind (ToM) and
systematic critical evaluation. We investigate three key questions. First, how
does the ability to model others' perspectives enhance coordination and reduce
redundant reasoning? Second, to what extent does structured critique improve
reasoning quality by identifying logical gaps and mitigating biases? Third, the
interplay of these mechanisms can lead to emergent cognitive synergy, where the
collective intelligence of the system exceeds the sum of its parts. Through an
empirical case study on complex decision making, we show that the integration
of these cognitive mechanisms leads to more coherent, adaptive, and rigorous
agent interactions. This article contributes to the field of cognitive science
and AI research by presenting a structured framework that emulates human-like
collaborative reasoning MAS. It highlights the significance of dynamic ToM and
critical evaluation in advancing multi-agent systems' ability to tackle
complex, real-world challenges.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance, there is growing interest in using
them to simulate human social behavior through generative agent-based modeling
(GABM). However, validating these models remains a key challenge. We present a
systematic two-stage validation approach using social dilemma paradigms from
psychological literature, first identifying the cognitive components necessary
for LLM agents to reproduce known human behaviors in mixed-motive settings from
two landmark papers, then using the validated architecture to simulate novel
conditions. Our model comparison of different cognitive architectures shows
that both persona-based individual differences and theory of mind capabilities
are essential for replicating third-party punishment (TPP) as a costly signal
of trustworthiness. For the second study on public goods games, this
architecture is able to replicate an increase in cooperation from the spread of
reputational information through gossip. However, an additional strategic
component is necessary to replicate the additional boost in cooperation rates
in the condition that allows both ostracism and gossip. We then test novel
predictions for each paper with our validated generative agents. We find that
TPP rates significantly drop in settings where punishment is anonymous, yet a
substantial amount of TPP persists, suggesting that both reputational and
intrinsic moral motivations play a role in this behavior. For the second paper,
we introduce a novel intervention and see that open discussion periods before
rounds of the public goods game further increase contributions, allowing groups
to develop social norms for cooperation. This work provides a framework for
validating generative agent models while demonstrating their potential to
generate novel and testable insights into human social behavior.

Conclusion: 研究扩展了对承诺的理解，揭示了竞争环境中的战略漏洞，对经济市场、外交关系和多代理系统有重要启示。

Abstract: Commitments play a crucial role in game theory, shaping strategic
interactions by either altering a player's own payoffs or influencing the
incentives of others through outcome-contingent payments. While most research
has focused on using commitments to achieve efficient equilibria, their
potential applications beyond this goal remain largely unexplored. In this
study, we introduce a non-coercive extortion mechanism that leverages
commitments to outcome-contingent payments, demonstrating how a player or
external agent can extract profit by offering rewards rather than threatening
punishment. At the core of the mechanism is the introduction of sequentiality
into a simultaneous-move game, fundamentally reshaping the strategic
interaction. We derive the conditions under which extortion is successful,
identify the class of games susceptible to this scheme, and determine both the
maximum extractable profit and the minimum required payment. To illustrate the
extortion mechanism, we apply it to 2x2 games, highlighting how even simple
strategic settings can be vulnerable to this form of manipulation. Our results
reveal strategic vulnerabilities in competitive settings, with significant
implications for economic markets, diplomatic relations, and multi-agent
systems operating in blockchain environments. This work broadens our
understanding of commitments in game theory and raises critical questions about
how to safeguard strategic interactions from exploitation through non-coercive
extortion.

Result: 能够准确建模空间变化的材料特性，避免膜锁定，相比基于图和神经ODE的方法，训练更快、重建精度更高、泛化能力更强。

Conclusion: Mass-Spring Net是一种高效、准确的布料模拟替代方法，适用于复杂动态场景。

Abstract: Materials used in real clothing exhibit remarkable complexity and spatial
variation due to common processes such as stitching, hemming, dyeing, printing,
padding, and bonding. Simulating these materials, for instance using finite
element methods, is often computationally demanding and slow. Worse, such
methods can suffer from numerical artifacts called ``membrane locking'' that
makes cloth appear artificially stiff. Here we propose a general framework,
called Mass-Spring Net, for learning a simple yet efficient surrogate model
that captures the effects of these complex materials using only motion
observations. The cloth is discretized into a mass-spring network with unknown
material parameters that are learned directly from the motion data, using a
novel force-and-impulse loss function. Our approach demonstrates the ability to
accurately model spatially varying material properties from a variety of data
sources, and immunity to membrane locking which plagues FEM-based simulations.
Compared to graph-based networks and neural ODE-based architectures, our method
achieves significantly faster training times, higher reconstruction accuracy,
and improved generalization to novel dynamic scenarios.

Method: BANG利用预训练的潜在扩散模型和轻量级爆炸视图适配器，结合时间注意力模块和空间提示，实现精确控制和流畅过渡。

Result: BANG能生成详细的部分级几何结构，支持功能描述关联，并应用于3D打印等制造流程。

Conclusion: BANG为3D创作提供了更直观、灵活的工具，符合人类直觉，扩展了从概念到资产的转化能力。

Abstract: 3D creation has always been a unique human strength, driven by our ability to
deconstruct and reassemble objects using our eyes, mind and hand. However,
current 3D design tools struggle to replicate this natural process, requiring
considerable artistic expertise and manual labor. This paper introduces BANG, a
novel generative approach that bridges 3D generation and reasoning, allowing
for intuitive and flexible part-level decomposition of 3D objects. At the heart
of BANG is "Generative Exploded Dynamics", which creates a smooth sequence of
exploded states for an input geometry, progressively separating parts while
preserving their geometric and semantic coherence.
  BANG utilizes a pre-trained large-scale latent diffusion model, fine-tuned
for exploded dynamics with a lightweight exploded view adapter, allowing
precise control over the decomposition process. It also incorporates a temporal
attention module to ensure smooth transitions and consistency across time. BANG
enhances control with spatial prompts, such as bounding boxes and surface
regions, enabling users to specify which parts to decompose and how. This
interaction can be extended with multimodal models like GPT-4, enabling
2D-to-3D manipulations for more intuitive and creative workflows.
  The capabilities of BANG extend to generating detailed part-level geometry,
associating parts with functional descriptions, and facilitating
component-aware 3D creation and manufacturing workflows. Additionally, BANG
offers applications in 3D printing, where separable parts are generated for
easy printing and reassembly. In essence, BANG enables seamless transformation
from imaginative concepts to detailed 3D assets, offering a new perspective on
creation that resonates with human intuition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 触觉感知对机器人在动态和非结构化环境中的应用至关重要，但传统方法依赖复杂材料或设计，亟需一种简单且可靠的解决方案。

Method: 采用3D打印弹性体晶格和嵌入式气道（流体神经化），通过压力变化检测触觉，开发几何模型和神经网络预测接触位置与力，并结合导纳控制器模拟弹簧行为。

Result: 传感器表现出良好的响应特性，能够准确预测接触位置和力，并通过高冲击和循环加载验证了其耐用性。

Conclusion: 流体神经化技术为机器人触觉感知提供了一种简单、适应性强且耐用的解决方案，拓展了多功能机器人操作的潜力。

Abstract: Tactile sensing plays a fundamental role in enabling robots to navigate
dynamic and unstructured environments, particularly in applications such as
delicate object manipulation, surface exploration, and human-robot interaction.
In this paper, we introduce a passive soft robotic fingertip with integrated
tactile sensing, fabricated using a 3D-printed elastomer lattice with embedded
air channels. This sensorization approach, termed fluidic innervation,
transforms the lattice into a tactile sensor by detecting pressure changes
within sealed air channels, providing a simple yet robust solution to tactile
sensing in robotics. Unlike conventional methods that rely on complex materials
or designs, fluidic innervation offers a simple, scalable, single-material
fabrication process. We characterize the sensors' response, develop a geometric
model to estimate tip displacement, and train a neural network to accurately
predict contact location and contact force. Additionally, we integrate the
fingertip with an admittance controller to emulate spring-like behavior,
demonstrate its capability for environment exploration through tactile
feedback, and validate its durability under high impact and cyclic loading
conditions. This tactile sensing technique offers advantages in terms of
simplicity, adaptability, and durability and opens up new opportunities for
versatile robotic manipulation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散去噪的陀螺罗盘方法，显著提高了低成本陀螺仪的导航精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低成本陀螺仪在无外部导航辅助时难以提供精确的航向角，影响导航效率与安全。

Method: 结合扩散去噪框架与学习型航向估计模型，预处理传感器信号以提高精度。

Result: 实验表明，该方法比模型驱动方法精度提高26%，比学习驱动方法提高15%。

Conclusion: 该方法为低成本陀螺仪在自主平台中的导航提供了更准确和鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: An accurate initial heading angle is essential for efficient and safe
navigation across diverse domains. Unlike magnetometers, gyroscopes can provide
accurate heading reference independent of the magnetic disturbances in a
process known as gyrocompassing. Yet, accurate and timely gyrocompassing, using
low-cost gyroscopes, remains a significant challenge in scenarios where
external navigation aids are unavailable. Such challenges are commonly
addressed in real-world applications such as autonomous vehicles, where size,
weight, and power limitations restrict sensor quality, and noisy measurements
severely degrade gyrocompassing performance. To cope with this challenge, we
propose a novel diffusion denoiser-aided gyrocompass approach. It integrates a
diffusion-based denoising framework with an enhanced learning-based heading
estimation model. The diffusion denoiser processes raw inertial sensor signals
before input to the deep learning model, resulting in accurate gyrocompassing.
Experiments using both simulated and real sensor data demonstrate that our
proposed approach improves gyrocompassing accuracy by 26% compared to
model-based gyrocompassing and by 15% compared to other learning-driven
approaches. This advancement holds particular significance for ensuring
accurate and robust navigation in autonomous platforms that incorporate
low-cost gyroscopes within their navigation systems.

Abstract: Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) is a powerful approach for
controlling highly dynamic robotic systems, as it accounts for system dynamics
and optimizes control inputs at each step. However, its high computational
complexity makes implementation on resource-constrained microcontrollers
impractical. While recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of Model
Predictive Control (MPC) with linearized dynamics on microcontrollers, applying
full NMPC remains a significant challenge. This work presents an efficient
solution for generating and deploying NMPC on microcontrollers (NMPCM) to
control quadrotor UAVs. The proposed method optimizes computational efficiency
while maintaining high control accuracy. Simulations in Gazebo/ROS and
real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of the approach,

Abstract: Terrestrial-aerial bimodal vehicles, which integrate the high mobility of
aerial robots with the long endurance of ground robots, offer significant
potential for autonomous exploration. Given the inherent energy and time
constraints in practical exploration tasks, we present a hierarchical framework
for the bimodal vehicle to utilize its flexible locomotion modalities for
exploration. Beginning with extracting environmental information to identify
informative regions, we generate a set of potential bimodal viewpoints. To
adaptively manage energy and time constraints, we introduce an extended Monte
Carlo Tree Search approach that strategically optimizes both modality selection
and viewpoint sequencing. Combined with an improved bimodal vehicle motion
planner, we present a complete bimodal energy- and time-aware exploration
system. Extensive simulations and deployment on a customized real-world
platform demonstrate the effectiveness of our system.

TL;DR: 穿戴式机器人通过训练改善步态和身体感知，但感知与实际运动间存在持续差异，需增强感知校准。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索穿戴式机器人如何影响人类运动系统和身体感知，以及如何优化训练效果。

Method: 测量步态表现和感知身体图像（SCoMo），基于人类运动学习理论验证假设。

Result: 运动学习改善了步态和感知，但感知与实际运动间仍有差异，可能限制进一步改进。

Conclusion: 增强穿戴式机器人的感知和频繁校准身体感知对有效训练和技术发展至关重要。

Abstract: Advances in wearable robotics challenge the traditional definition of human
motor systems, as wearable robots redefine body structure, movement capability,
and perception of their own bodies. We measured gait performance and perceived
body images via Selected Coefficient of Perceived Motion, SCoMo, after each
training session. Based on human motor learning theory extended to wearer-robot
systems, we hypothesized that learning the perceived body image when walking
with a robotic leg co-evolves with the actual gait improvement and becomes more
certain and more accurate to the actual motion. Our result confirmed that motor
learning improved both physical and perceived gait pattern towards normal,
indicating that via practice the wearers incorporated the robotic leg into
their sensorimotor systems to enable wearer-robot movement coordination.
However, a persistent discrepancy between perceived and actual motion remained,
likely due to the absence of direct sensation and control of the prosthesis
from wearers. Additionally, the perceptual overestimation at the later training
sessions might limit further motor improvement. These findings suggest that
enhancing the human sense of wearable robots and frequent calibrating
perception of body image are essential for effective training with lower limb
wearable robots and for developing more embodied assistive technologies.

Method: 使用麦克风阵列和异步近场麦克风，结合信号粗对齐与时域声学回声消除算法，估计时频理想比率掩码以隔离目标语音。

Result: 在1dB信噪比下，平均角度误差为4度，95%的定位精度在5度以内，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在噪声环境下实现了高精度的声源定位，为机器人交互提供了可靠支持。

Abstract: This paper presents a sound source localization strategy that relies on a
microphone array embedded in an unmanned ground vehicle and an asynchronous
close-talking microphone near the operator. A signal coarse alignment strategy
is combined with a time-domain acoustic echo cancellation algorithm to estimate
a time-frequency ideal ratio mask to isolate the target speech from
interferences and environmental noise. This allows selective sound source
localization, and provides the robot with the direction of arrival of sound
from the active operator, which enables rich interaction in noisy scenarios.
Results demonstrate an average angle error of 4 degrees and an accuracy within
5 degrees of 95\% at a signal-to-noise ratio of 1dB, which is significantly
superior to the state-of-the-art localization methods.

Motivation: 研究动机在于扩展物理储层计算（PRC）框架，利用软体机器人的动力学特性实现多行为控制，并探索其在具身认知研究中的潜力。

Method: 通过模拟研究，将PRC应用于一种称为张力完整性机器人的软体机器人，分析其多稳态动力学和吸引子特性。

Conclusion: 研究展示了PRC在理解具身认知未充分探索特征方面的潜力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that the dynamics of physical systems can be
utilized for the desired information processing under the framework of physical
reservoir computing (PRC). Robots with soft bodies are examples of such
physical systems, and their nonlinear body-environment dynamics can be used to
compute and generate the motor signals necessary for the control of their own
behavior. In this simulation study, we extend this approach to control and
embed not only one but also multiple behaviors into a type of soft robot called
a tensegrity robot. The resulting system, consisting of the robot and the
environment, is a multistable dynamical system that converges to different
attractors from varying initial conditions. Furthermore, attractor analysis
reveals that there exist "untrained attractors" in the state space of the
system outside the training data. These untrained attractors reflect the
intrinsic properties and structures of the tensegrity robot and its
interactions with the environment. The impacts of these recent findings in PRC
remain unexplored in embodied AI research. We here illustrate their potential
to understand various features of embodied cognition that have not been fully
addressed to date.

### [110] [Decision Transformer-Based Drone Trajectory Planning with Dynamic Safety-Efficiency Trade-Offs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21506)
*Chang-Hun Ji,SiWoon Song,Youn-Hee Han,SungTae Moon*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于决策变换器的无人机轨迹规划器，通过单一参数RTG动态调整安全与效率的权衡，无需专家知识，并在仿真和实际实验中验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多项式规划器需专家调参且难以达到理想权衡，而强化学习规划器未明确处理安全与效率的权衡，因此需要一种更直观且动态的解决方案。

Method: 采用决策变换器框架，引入RTG作为温度参数，动态调整安全与效率的权衡。RTG直观衡量轨迹的安全性和效率，简化调参过程。

Result: 仿真和实际实验表明，该规划器通过调整RTG参数能动态优化权衡，且在安全性和效率上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的规划器通过RTG参数实现了动态权衡调整，兼具实用性和可靠性，适用于未知环境中的无人机任务。

Abstract: A drone trajectory planner should be able to dynamically adjust the
safety-efficiency trade-off according to varying mission requirements in
unknown environments. Although traditional polynomial-based planners offer
computational efficiency and smooth trajectory generation, they require expert
knowledge to tune multiple parameters to adjust this trade-off. Moreover, even
with careful tuning, the resulting adjustment may fail to achieve the desired
trade-off. Similarly, although reinforcement learning-based planners are
adaptable in unknown environments, they do not explicitly address the
safety-efficiency trade-off. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
Decision Transformer-based trajectory planner that leverages a single
parameter, Return-to-Go (RTG), as a \emph{temperature parameter} to dynamically
adjust the safety-efficiency trade-off. In our framework, since RTG intuitively
measures the safety and efficiency of a trajectory, RTG tuning does not require
expert knowledge. We validate our approach using Gazebo simulations in both
structured grid and unstructured random environments. The experimental results
demonstrate that our planner can dynamically adjust the safety-efficiency
trade-off by simply tuning the RTG parameter. Furthermore, our planner
outperforms existing baseline methods across various RTG settings, generating
safer trajectories when tuned for safety and more efficient trajectories when
tuned for efficiency. Real-world experiments further confirm the reliability
and practicality of our proposed planner.

Motivation: 多楼层室内探索是一个开放的研究领域，现有学习型探索器多局限于2D环境，需扩展至3D。

Method: LITE将环境分解为楼层-楼梯拓扑，使用YOLO11实例分割模型逐步构建拓扑，并通过有限状态机实现楼层切换；同时采用基于注意力的2D探索策略。

Result: 在HM3D和MP3D数据集上，2D探索策略显著优于基线方法；3D多楼层环境中框架兼容多种2D方法，并在真实四足机器人上验证了泛化能力。

Conclusion: LITE框架有效支持多楼层室内探索，兼容性强且泛化能力突出。

Abstract: This work focuses on multi-floor indoor exploration, which remains an open
area of research. Compared to traditional methods, recent learning-based
explorers have demonstrated significant potential due to their robust
environmental learning and modeling capabilities, but most are restricted to 2D
environments. In this paper, we proposed a learning-integrated topological
explorer, LITE, for multi-floor indoor environments. LITE decomposes the
environment into a floor-stair topology, enabling seamless integration of
learning or non-learning-based 2D exploration methods for 3D exploration. As we
incrementally build floor-stair topology in exploration using YOLO11-based
instance segmentation model, the agent can transition between floors through a
finite state machine. Additionally, we implement an attention-based 2D
exploration policy that utilizes an attention mechanism to capture spatial
dependencies between different regions, thereby determining the next global
goal for more efficient exploration. Extensive comparison and ablation studies
conducted on the HM3D and MP3D datasets demonstrate that our proposed 2D
exploration policy significantly outperforms all baseline explorers in terms of
exploration efficiency. Furthermore, experiments in several 3D multi-floor
environments indicate that our framework is compatible with various 2D
exploration methods, facilitating effective multi-floor indoor exploration.
Finally, we validate our method in the real world with a quadruped robot,
highlighting its strong generalization capabilities.

Result: 在模拟控制和真实导航实验中，该方法显著提升了样本效率、分布外泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法在可解释性、复杂性和安全性方面具有优势，同时在实际应用中表现出色。

Abstract: Human demonstration data is often ambiguous and incomplete, motivating
imitation learning approaches that also exhibit reliable planning behavior. A
common paradigm to perform planning-from-demonstration involves learning a
reward function via Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) then deploying this
reward via Model Predictive Control (MPC). Towards unifying these methods, we
derive a replacement of the policy in IRL with a planning-based agent. With
connections to Adversarial Imitation Learning, this formulation enables
end-to-end interactive learning of planners from observation-only
demonstrations. In addition to benefits in interpretability, complexity, and
safety, we study and observe significant improvements on sample efficiency,
out-of-distribution generalization, and robustness. The study includes
evaluations in both simulated control benchmarks and real-world navigation
experiments using few-to-single observation-only demonstrations.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在长时程结构和符号接地方面的局限性，以及手工或狭窄领域的泛化问题。

Method: 从12,393个操作视频中提取原子领域，构建统一领域，并通过检索和融合支持组合泛化。

Result: 在零样本任务中，任务成功率提升58%，计划最优性提升160%。

Conclusion: UniDomain在复杂任务规划中表现出色，优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: Robotic task planning in real-world environments requires reasoning over
implicit constraints from language and vision. While LLMs and VLMs offer strong
priors, they struggle with long-horizon structure and symbolic grounding.
Existing methods that combine LLMs with symbolic planning often rely on
handcrafted or narrow domains, limiting generalization. We propose UniDomain, a
framework that pre-trains a PDDL domain from robot manipulation demonstrations
and applies it for online robotic task planning. It extracts atomic domains
from 12,393 manipulation videos to form a unified domain with 3137 operators,
2875 predicates, and 16481 causal edges. Given a target class of tasks, it
retrieves relevant atomics from the unified domain and systematically fuses
them into high-quality meta-domains to support compositional generalization in
planning. Experiments on diverse real-world tasks show that UniDomain solves
complex, unseen tasks in a zero-shot manner, achieving up to 58% higher task
success and 160% improvement in plan optimality over state-of-the-art LLM and
LLM-PDDL baselines.

challenging case of underground tunnels. We also highlight potential new
research areas still under-explored.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving technology,
vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication has emerged as a key enabler for
extending perception range and enhancing driving safety by providing visibility
beyond the line of sight. However, integrating multi-source sensor data from
both ego-vehicles and infrastructure under real-world constraints, such as

technical challenges. To facilitate research in this area, we organized the
End-to-End Autonomous Driving through V2X Cooperation Challenge, which features
two tracks: cooperative temporal perception and cooperative end-to-end
planning. Built on the UniV2X framework and the V2X-Seq-SPD dataset, the
challenge attracted participation from over 30 teams worldwide and established
a unified benchmark for evaluating cooperative driving systems. This paper
describes the design and outcomes of the challenge, highlights key research
problems including bandwidth-aware fusion, robust multi-agent planning, and
heterogeneous sensor integration, and analyzes emerging technical trends among
top-performing solutions. By addressing practical constraints in communication
and data fusion, the challenge contributes to the development of scalable and

Conclusion: 所提框架和策略有效解决了动态环境下的SLAM定位漂移问题，提升了系统性能。

Abstract: Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) plays a vital role in
real-time localization for autonomous systems. However, traditional SLAM
methods, which assume a static environment, often suffer from significant
localization drift in dynamic scenarios. While recent advancements have
improved SLAM performance in such environments, these systems still struggle
with localization drift, particularly due to abrupt viewpoint changes and
poorly characterized moving objects. In this paper, we propose a novel
scene-object-based reliability assessment framework that comprehensively
evaluates SLAM stability through both current frame quality metrics and scene
changes relative to reliable reference frames. Furthermore, to tackle the lack
of error correction mechanisms in existing systems when pose estimation becomes
unreliable, we employ a pose refinement strategy that leverages information
from reliable frames to optimize camera pose estimation, effectively mitigating
the adverse effects of dynamic interference. Extensive experiments on the TUM
RGB-D datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves substantial improvements
in localization accuracy and system robustness under challenging dynamic
scenarios.

Abstract: A reliable communication network is essential for multiple UAVs operating
within obstacle-cluttered environments, where limited communication due to
obstructions often occurs. A common solution is to deploy intermediate UAVs to
relay information via a multi-hop network, which introduces two challenges: (i)
how to design the structure of multihop networks; and (ii) how to maintain
connectivity during collaborative motion. To this end, this work first proposes
an efficient constrained search method based on the minimumedge RRT? algorithm,
to find a spanning-tree topology that requires a less number of UAVs for the
deployment task. Then, to achieve this deployment, a distributed model
predictive control strategy is proposed for the online motion coordination. It
explicitly incorporates not only the inter-UAV and UAVobstacle distance
constraints, but also the line-of-sight (LOS) connectivity constraint. These
constraints are well-known to be nonlinear and often tackled by various
approximations. In contrast, this work provides a theoretical guarantee that
all agent trajectories are ensured to be collision-free with a teamwise LOS
connectivity at all time. Numerous simulations are performed in 3D valley-like
environments, while hardware experiments validate its dynamic adaptation when
the deployment position changes online.

Motivation: 现有机器人学习算法在处理变形物体时存在挑战，缺乏相关标准化基准。

Result: 展示了算法的性能，并成功将训练策略部署到现实世界的Spot机器人上。

Conclusion: MoDeSuite有望推动移动操作变形物体的研究领域发展。

Abstract: Mobile manipulation is a critical capability for robots operating in diverse,
real-world environments. However, manipulating deformable objects and materials
remains a major challenge for existing robot learning algorithms. While various
benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate manipulation strategies with rigid
objects, there is still a notable lack of standardized benchmarks that address
mobile manipulation tasks involving deformable objects.
  To address this gap, we introduce MoDeSuite, the first Mobile Manipulation
Deformable Object task suite, designed specifically for robot learning.
MoDeSuite consists of eight distinct mobile manipulation tasks covering both
elastic objects and deformable objects, each presenting a unique challenge
inspired by real-world robot applications. Success in these tasks requires
effective collaboration between the robot's base and manipulator, as well as
the ability to exploit the deformability of the objects. To evaluate and
demonstrate the use of the proposed benchmark, we train two state-of-the-art
reinforcement learning algorithms and two imitation learning algorithms,
highlighting the difficulties encountered and showing their performance in
simulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical relevance of the suite by
deploying the trained policies directly into the real world with the Spot
robot, showcasing the potential for sim-to-real transfer. We expect that
MoDeSuite will open a novel research domain in mobile manipulation involving
deformable objects. Find more details, code, and videos at

Result: 实验表明ExamPPO能有效调节对抗行为、暴露AV决策弱点，并在异构环境中泛化。

Conclusion: ExamPPO为自动驾驶决策系统的安全性和智能性评估提供了统一且可复现的解决方案。

Abstract: Scientific testing techniques are essential for ensuring the safe operation
of autonomous vehicles (AVs), with high-risk, highly interactive scenarios
being a primary focus. To address the limitations of existing testing methods,
such as their heavy reliance on high-quality test data, weak interaction
capabilities, and low adversarial robustness, this paper proposes ExamPPO, an
interactive adversarial testing framework that enables scenario-adaptive and
intensity-controllable evaluation of autonomous vehicles. The framework models
the Surrounding Vehicle (SV) as an intelligent examiner, equipped with a
multi-head attention-enhanced policy network, enabling context-sensitive and
sustained behavioral interventions. A scalar confrontation factor is introduced
to modulate the intensity of adversarial behaviors, allowing continuous,
fine-grained adjustment of test difficulty. Coupled with structured evaluation
metrics, ExamPPO systematically probes AV's robustness across diverse scenarios
and strategies. Extensive experiments across multiple scenarios and AV
strategies demonstrate that ExamPPO can effectively modulate adversarial
behavior, expose decision-making weaknesses in tested AVs, and generalize
across heterogeneous environments, thereby offering a unified and reproducible
solution for evaluating the safety and intelligence of autonomous
decision-making systems.

Abstract: Testing and evaluating automated driving systems (ADS) in interactions with
vulnerable road users (VRUs), such as cyclists, are essential for improving the
safety of VRUs, but often lack realism. This paper presents and validates a
coupled in-the-loop test environment that integrates a Cyclist-in-the Loop test
bench with a Vehicle-in-the-Loop test bench via a virtual environment (VE)
developed in Unreal Engine 5. The setup enables closed-loop, bidirectional
interaction between a real human cyclist and a real automated vehicle under
safe and controllable conditions. The automated vehicle reacts to cyclist
gestures via stimulated camera input, while the cyclist, riding a stationary
bicycle, perceives and reacts to the vehicle in the VE in real time. Validation
experiments are conducted using a real automated shuttle bus with a
track-and-follow function, performing three test maneuvers - straight-line
driving with stop, circular track driving, and double lane change - on a
proving ground and in the coupled in-the-loop test environment. The performance
is evaluated by comparing the resulting vehicle trajectories in both
environments. Additionally, the introduced latencies of individual components
in the test setup are measured. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the
approach and highlight its strengths and limitations for realistic ADS
evaluation.

Abstract: One major recurring challenge in deploying manipulation robots is determining
the optimal placement of manipulators to maximize performance. This challenge
is exacerbated in complex, cluttered agricultural environments of high-value
crops, such as flowers, fruits, and vegetables, that could greatly benefit from
robotic systems tailored to their specific requirements. However, the design of
such systems remains a challenging, intuition-driven process, limiting the
affordability and adoption of robotics-based automation by domain experts like
farmers. To address this challenge, we propose a four-part design optimization
methodology for automating the development of task-specific robotic systems.
This framework includes (a) a robot design model, (b) task and environment
representations for simulation, (c) task-specific performance metrics, and (d)
optimization algorithms for refining configurations. We demonstrate our
framework by optimizing a dual-arm robotic system for pepper harvesting using
two off-the-shelf redundant manipulators. To enhance performance, we introduce
novel task metrics that leverage self-motion manifolds to characterize
manipulator redundancy comprehensively. Our results show that our framework
achieves simultaneous improvements in reachability success rates and
improvements in dexterity. Specifically, our approach improves reachability
success by at least 14\% over baseline methods and achieves over 30\%
improvement in dexterity based on our task-specific metric.

Conclusion: 本文方法为冗余机械臂的全局逆运动学问题提供了高效解决方案，并填补了棱柱关节系统的研究空白。

Abstract: Redundant manipulators are well understood to offer infinite joint
configurations for achieving a desired end-effector pose. The multiplicity of
inverse kinematics (IK) solutions allows for the simultaneous solving of
auxiliary tasks like avoiding joint limits or obstacles. However, the most
widely used IK solvers are numerical gradient-based iterative methods that
inherently return a locally optimal solution. In this work, we explore the
computation of self-motion manifolds (SMMs), which represent the set of all
joint configurations that solve the inverse kinematics problem for redundant
manipulators. Thus, SMMs are global IK solutions for redundant manipulators. We
focus on task redundancies of dimensionality 1, introducing a novel ODE
formulation for computing SMMs using standard explicit fixed-step ODE
integrators. We also address the challenge of ``inducing'' redundancy in
otherwise non-redundant manipulators assigned to tasks naturally described by
one degree of freedom less than the non-redundant manipulator. Furthermore,
recognizing that SMMs can consist of multiple disconnected components, we
propose methods for searching for these separate SMM components. Our
formulations and algorithms compute accurate SMM solutions without requiring
additional IK refinement, and we extend our methods to prismatic joint systems
-- an area not covered in current SMM literature. This manuscript presents the
derivation of these methods and several examples that show how the methods work
and their limitations.

Abstract: Retinal vein cannulation (RVC) is a minimally invasive microsurgical
procedure for treating retinal vein occlusion (RVO), a leading cause of vision
impairment. However, the small size and fragility of retinal veins, coupled
with the need for high-precision, tremor-free needle manipulation, create
significant technical challenges. These limitations highlight the need for
robotic assistance to improve accuracy and stability. This study presents an
automated robotic system with a top-down microscope and B-scan optical
coherence tomography (OCT) imaging for precise depth sensing. Deep
learning-based models enable real-time needle navigation, contact detection,
and vein puncture recognition, using a chicken embryo model as a surrogate for
human retinal veins. The system autonomously detects needle position and
puncture events with 85% accuracy. The experiments demonstrate notable
reductions in navigation and puncture times compared to manual methods. Our
results demonstrate the potential of integrating advanced imaging and deep
learning to automate microsurgical tasks, providing a pathway for safer and
more reliable RVC procedures with enhanced precision and reproducibility.

Motivation: 四足机器人在执行移动操作任务时，高自由度模型和机械臂动态增加了计算复杂度，需要高效的MPC算法。

Method: 采用分解策略，将运动模板模型（如单刚体模型）与机械臂全阶动态模型耦合，实现扭矩级控制，NMPC以60 Hz运行，低层WBC以500 Hz跟踪轨迹。

Result: 在15 kg Unitree Go2机器人和4.4 kg Kinova机械臂上验证，NMPC框架能稳定处理外部扰动、负载变化和不平坦地形。

Conclusion: 该框架为高自由度移动操作任务提供了一种计算高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) combined with reduced-order template models
has emerged as a powerful tool for trajectory optimization in dynamic legged
locomotion. However, loco-manipulation tasks performed by legged robots
introduce additional complexity, necessitating computationally efficient MPC
algorithms capable of handling high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) models. This letter
presents a computationally efficient nonlinear MPC (NMPC) framework tailored
for loco-manipulation tasks of quadrupedal robots equipped with robotic
manipulators whose dynamics are non-negligible relative to those of the
quadruped. The proposed framework adopts a decomposition strategy that couples
locomotion template models -- such as the single rigid body (SRB) model -- with
a full-order dynamic model of the robotic manipulator for torque-level control.
This decomposition enables efficient real-time solution of the NMPC problem in
a receding horizon fashion at 60 Hz. The optimal state and input trajectories
generated by the NMPC for locomotion are tracked by a low-level nonlinear
whole-body controller (WBC) running at 500 Hz, while the optimal torque
commands for the manipulator are directly applied. The layered control
architecture is validated through extensive numerical simulations and hardware
experiments on a 15-kg Unitree Go2 quadrupedal robot augmented with a 4.4-kg
4-DoF Kinova arm. Given that the Kinova arm dynamics are non-negligible
relative to the Go2 base, the proposed NMPC framework demonstrates robust
stability in performing diverse loco-manipulation tasks, effectively handling
external disturbances, payload variations, and uneven terrain.

Motivation: 深度神经网络在持续学习中存在灾难性遗忘问题，论文旨在通过模仿人类学习策略来解决这一问题。

Method: TFC-SR结合了主动回忆探针机制，定期评估模型记忆以稳定过去知识的表示。

Result: 在Split CIFAR-100等基准测试中，TFC-SR表现优于现有方法，例如准确率从7.40%提升至13.17%。

Conclusion: TFC-SR是一种高效且鲁棒的方法，强调了主动记忆检索机制在持续学习中的重要性。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks often suffer from a critical limitation known as
Catastrophic Forgetting, where performance on past tasks degrades after
learning new ones. This paper introduces a novel continual learning approach
inspired by human learning strategies like Active Recall, Deliberate Practice
and Spaced Repetition, named Task Focused Consolidation with Spaced Recall
(TFC-SR). TFC-SR enhances the standard experience replay with a mechanism we
termed the Active Recall Probe. It is a periodic, task-aware evaluation of the
model's memory that stabilizes the representations of past knowledge. We test
TFC-SR on the Split MNIST and Split CIFAR-100 benchmarks against leading
regularization-based and replay-based baselines. Our results show that TFC-SR
performs significantly better than these methods. For instance, on the Split
CIFAR-100, it achieves a final accuracy of 13.17% compared to standard replay's
7.40%. We demonstrate that this advantage comes from the stabilizing effect of
the probe itself, and not from the difference in replay volume. Additionally,
we analyze the trade-off between memory size and performance and show that
while TFC-SR performs better in memory-constrained environments, higher replay
volume is still more effective when available memory is abundant. We conclude
that TFC-SR is a robust and efficient approach, highlighting the importance of
integrating active memory retrieval mechanisms into continual learning systems.

Abstract: Unsupervised and supervised learning methods conventionally use kernels to

Conclusion: 该方法为解决野火预测中的不平衡数据和高维时空数据问题提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Wildfires significantly impact natural ecosystems and human health, leading
to biodiversity loss, increased hydrogeological risks, and elevated emissions
of toxic substances. Climate change exacerbates these effects, particularly in
regions with rising temperatures and prolonged dry periods, such as the
Mediterranean. This requires the development of advanced risk management
strategies that utilize state-of-the-art technologies. However, in this
context, the data show a bias toward an imbalanced setting, where the incidence
of wildfire events is significantly lower than typical situations. This
imbalance, coupled with the inherent complexity of high-dimensional
spatio-temporal data, poses significant challenges for training deep learning
architectures. Moreover, since precise wildfire predictions depend mainly on
weather data, finding a way to reduce computational costs to enable more
frequent updates using the latest weather forecasts would be beneficial. This
paper investigates how adopting a contrastive framework can address these
challenges through enhanced latent representations for the patch's dynamic
features. We thus introduce a new morphology-based curriculum contrastive
learning that mitigates issues associated with diverse regional characteristics
and enables the use of smaller patch sizes without compromising performance. An
experimental analysis is performed to validate the effectiveness of the
proposed modeling strategies.

Result: 在需求预测中，SPADE-S表现优于现有方法，最高提升15%的预测准确率，具体数据集中P90和P50准确率均有显著提升。

Conclusion: SPADE-S有效解决了时间序列预测中的幅度和稀疏性问题，显著提升了预测准确性。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in time series forecasting, accurate
modeling of time series with strong heterogeneity in magnitude and/or sparsity
patterns remains challenging for state-of-the-art deep learning architectures.
We identify several factors that lead existing models to systematically
underperform on low-magnitude and sparse time series, including loss functions
with implicit biases toward high-magnitude series, training-time sampling
methods, and limitations of time series encoding methods.
  SPADE-S is a robust forecasting architecture that significantly reduces
magnitude- and sparsity-based systematic biases and improves overall prediction
accuracy. Empirical results demonstrate that SPADE-S outperforms existing
state-of-the-art approaches across a diverse set of use cases in demand
forecasting. In particular, we show that, depending on the quantile forecast
and magnitude of the series, SPADE-S can improve forecast accuracy by up to
15%. This results in P90 overall forecast accuracy gains of 2.21%, 6.58%, and
4.28%, and P50 forecast accuracy gains of 0.92%, 0.77%, and 1.95%,
respectively, for each of three distinct datasets, ranging from 3 million to
700 million series, from a large online retailer.

Conclusion: 强调了分布偏移问题的重要性，并呼吁更多研究关注OOD数据。

Abstract: In the field of Machine Learning (ML) and data-driven applications, one of
the significant challenge is the change in data distribution between the
training and deployment stages, commonly known as distribution shift. This
paper outlines different mechanisms for handling two main types of distribution
shifts: (i) Covariate shift: where the value of features or covariates change
between train and test data, and (ii) Concept/Semantic-shift: where model
experiences shift in the concept learned during training due to emergence of
novel classes in the test phase. We sum up our contributions in three folds.
First, we formalize distribution shifts, recite on how the conventional method
fails to handle them adequately and urge for a model that can simultaneously
perform better in all types of distribution shifts. Second, we discuss why
handling distribution shifts is important and provide an extensive review of
the methods and techniques that have been developed to detect, measure, and
mitigate the effects of these shifts. Third, we discuss the current state of
distribution shift handling mechanisms and propose future research directions
in this area. Overall, we provide a retrospective synopsis of the literature in
the distribution shift, focusing on OOD data that had been overlooked in the
existing surveys.

### [135] [OCSVM-Guided Representation Learning for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21164)
*Nicolas Pinon,Carole Lartizien*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新方法，将表示学习与一类支持向量机（OCSVM）紧密结合，通过自定义损失函数直接对齐潜在特征与OCSVM决策边界，解决了无监督异常检测中的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无监督异常检测（UAD）中，现有方法存在重建异常样本过于完美或特征空间不优的问题，需要一种更紧密耦合表示学习和异常检测的方法。

Method: 提出了一种新方法，通过自定义损失函数将表示学习与一类支持向量机（OCSVM）紧密结合，直接对齐潜在特征与OCSVM决策边界。

Result: 在MNIST-C基准和脑MRI细微病变检测任务中表现优异，尤其在检测小、非高信号病变方面，展示了方法的鲁棒性和潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法在无监督异常检测和医学影像应用中具有潜力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) aims to detect anomalies without labeled
data, a necessity in many machine learning applications where anomalous samples
are rare or not available. Most state-of-the-art methods fall into two
categories: reconstruction-based approaches, which often reconstruct anomalies
too well, and decoupled representation learning with density estimators, which
can suffer from suboptimal feature spaces. While some recent methods attempt to
couple feature learning and anomaly detection, they often rely on surrogate
objectives, restrict kernel choices, or introduce approximations that limit
their expressiveness and robustness. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel method that tightly couples representation learning with an analytically
solvable one-class SVM (OCSVM), through a custom loss formulation that directly
aligns latent features with the OCSVM decision boundary. The model is evaluated
on two tasks: a new benchmark based on MNIST-C, and a challenging brain MRI
subtle lesion detection task. Unlike most methods that focus on large,
hyperintense lesions at the image level, our approach succeeds to target small,
non-hyperintense lesions, while we evaluate voxel-wise metrics, addressing a
more clinically relevant scenario. Both experiments evaluate a form of
robustness to domain shifts, including corruption types in MNIST-C and
scanner/age variations in MRI. Results demonstrate performance and robustness
of our proposed mode,highlighting its potential for general UAD and real-world
medical imaging applications. The source code is available at

Result: LAI-ML预测准确率达83%，比基线XGBoost高13%，并在21.7%的不一致案例中修正预测。

Conclusion: LAI-ML成功将黑盒模型预测转化为可信且可解释的临床见解，为医疗AI提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Background & Aims: High-performance machine learning models like XGBoost are
often "black boxes," limiting their clinical adoption due to a lack of
interpretability. This study aims to bridge the gap between predictive accuracy
and narrative transparency for sarcopenia risk assessment. Methods: We propose
the LLM-Adapted Interpretation Framework (LAI-ML), a novel knowledge
distillation architecture. LAI-ML transforms feature attributions from a
trained XGBoost model into a probabilistic format using specialized techniques
(HAGA and CACS). A Large Language Model (LLM), guided by a reinforcement
learning loop and case-based retrieval, then generates data-faithful diagnostic
narratives. Results: The LAI-ML framework achieved 83% prediction accuracy,
significantly outperforming the baseline XGBoost model, 13% higher. Notably,
the LLM not only replicated the teacher model's logic but also corrected its
predictions in 21.7% of discordant cases, demonstrating enhanced reasoning.
Conclusion: LAI-ML effectively translates opaque model predictions into
trustworthy and interpretable clinical insights, offering a deployable solution
to the "black-box" problem in medical AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络（如RNN、CNN和Transformer）在处理长序列时因内存限制而表现不佳，SSMs虽能解决此问题，但其训练和推理计算密集且耗能。

Method: 设计基于脉动阵列的EpochCore加速器，引入LIMA-PE处理单元和ProDF数据流，优化SSM模型的执行效率。

Result: EpochCore在性能和能效上分别提升250倍和45倍，面积成本增加2倍，在LRA数据集上比GPU快约2000倍。

Conclusion: EpochCore为SSM模型提供了高效的硬件支持，显著提升了长序列任务的处理能力。

Abstract: Sequence modeling is crucial for AI to understand temporal data and detect
complex time-dependent patterns. While recurrent neural networks (RNNs),
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and Transformers have advanced in
capturing long-range dependencies, they struggle with achieving high accuracy
with very long sequences due to limited memory retention (fixed context
window). State-Space Models (SSMs) leverage exponentially decaying memory
enabling lengthy context window and so they process very long data sequences
more efficiently than recurrent and Transformer-based models. Unlike
traditional neural models like CNNs and RNNs, SSM-based models require solving
differential equations through continuous integration, making training and
inference both compute- and memory-intensive on conventional CPUs and GPUs. In
this paper we introduce a specialized hardware accelerator, EpochCore, for
accelerating SSMs. EpochCore is based on systolic arrays (SAs) and is designed
to enhance the energy efficiency and throughput of inference of SSM-based
models for long-range sequence tasks. Within the SA, we propose a versatile
processing element (PE) called LIMA-PE to perform traditional and specialized
MAC operations to support traditional DNNs and SSMs. To complement the
EpochCore microarchitecture, we propose a novel dataflow, ProDF, which enables
highly efficient execution of SSM-based models. By leveraging the LIMA-PE
microarchitecture and ProDF, EpochCore achieves on average 250x gains in
performance and 45x improvement in energy efficiency, at the expense of 2x
increase in area cost over traditional SA-based accelerators, and around
~2,000x improvement in latency/inference on LRA datasets compared to GPU kernel
operations.

TL;DR: MaPPO是一种新的偏好优化框架，通过整合先验奖励知识改进对齐性能，无需额外超参数，适用于离线和在线场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如DPO）将偏好学习视为最大似然估计问题，忽略了先验奖励知识，可能导致对齐性能不足。

Method: MaPPO通过最大后验目标整合先验奖励知识，扩展了DPO及其变体，支持离线和在线优化。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，MaPPO显著提升了对齐性能，且计算效率未受影响。

Conclusion: MaPPO是一种高效且通用的偏好优化框架，可显著改进现有方法。

Abstract: As the era of large language models (LLMs) on behalf of users unfolds,
Preference Optimization (PO) methods have become a central approach to aligning
LLMs with human preferences and improving performance. We propose Maximum a
Posteriori Preference Optimization (MaPPO), a framework for learning from
preferences that explicitly incorporates prior reward knowledge into the
optimization objective. While existing methods such as Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) and its variants treat preference learning as a Maximum
Likelihood Estimation (MLE) problem, MaPPO extends this paradigm by integrating
prior reward estimates into a principled Maximum a Posteriori (MaP) objective.
This not only generalizes DPO and its variants, but also enhances alignment by
mitigating the oversimplified binary classification of responses. More
importantly, MaPPO introduces no additional hyperparameter, and supports
preference optimization in both offline and online settings. In addition, MaPPO
can be used as a plugin with consistent improvement on DPO variants, including
widely used SimPO, IPO, and CPO. Extensive empirical evaluations of different
model sizes and model series on three standard benchmarks, including MT-Bench,
AlpacaEval 2.0, and Arena-Hard, demonstrate consistent improvements in
alignment performance without sacrificing computational efficiency.

Abstract: Any agents we can possibly build are subject to capacity constraints, as
memory and compute resources are inherently finite. However, comparatively
little attention has been dedicated to understanding how agents with limited
capacity should allocate their resources for optimal performance. The goal of
this paper is to shed some light on this question by studying a simple yet
relevant continual learning problem: the capacity-constrained
linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) sequential prediction problem. We derive a
solution to this problem under appropriate technical conditions. Moreover, for
problems that can be decomposed into a set of sub-problems, we also demonstrate
how to optimally allocate capacity across these sub-problems in the steady
state. We view the results of this paper as a first step in the systematic
theoretical study of learning under capacity constraints.

Abstract: Scaling laws are fundamental mathematical relationships that predict how
neural network performance evolves with changes in variables such as model
size, dataset size, and computational resources. Traditionally, discovering
these laws requires extensive human expertise and manual experimentation. We
introduce EvoSLD, an automated framework for Scaling Law Discovery (SLD) that
leverages evolutionary algorithms guided by Large Language Models (LLMs) to
co-evolve symbolic expressions and their optimization routines. Formulated to
handle scaling variables, control variables, and response metrics across
diverse experimental settings, EvoSLD searches for parsimonious, universal
functional forms that minimize fitting errors on grouped data subsets.
Evaluated on five real-world scenarios from recent literature, EvoSLD
rediscovers exact human-derived laws in two cases and surpasses them in others,
achieving up to orders-of-magnitude reductions in normalized mean squared error
on held-out test sets. Compared to baselines like symbolic regression and
ablated variants, EvoSLD demonstrates superior accuracy, interpretability, and
efficiency, highlighting its potential to accelerate AI research. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床LLMs在面对微小但有临床意义的输入变化时表现不佳，而标准NLP指标无法检测这些潜在表示变化导致的诊断不稳定性。

Method: 通过结构化对抗编辑（如掩盖、否定、同义词替换和数值变化）生成临床笔记，并在PCA降维的潜在空间中计算LDFR。

Result: 实验发现，即使表面变化极小，临床LLMs仍表现出潜在脆弱性，且在真实临床数据（DiReCT基准）中验证了LDFR的普适性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了表面鲁棒性与语义稳定性之间的差距，强调了在安全关键临床AI中进行几何感知审计的重要性。

Abstract: LLMs for clinical decision support often fail under small but clinically
meaningful input shifts such as masking a symptom or negating a finding,
despite high performance on static benchmarks. These reasoning failures
frequently go undetected by standard NLP metrics, which are insensitive to
latent representation shifts that drive diagnosis instability. We propose a
geometry-aware evaluation framework, LAPD (Latent Agentic Perturbation
Diagnostics), which systematically probes the latent robustness of clinical
LLMs under structured adversarial edits. Within this framework, we introduce
Latent Diagnosis Flip Rate (LDFR), a model-agnostic diagnostic signal that
captures representational instability when embeddings cross decision boundaries
in PCA-reduced latent space. Clinical notes are generated using a structured
prompting pipeline grounded in diagnostic reasoning, then perturbed along four
axes: masking, negation, synonym replacement, and numeric variation to simulate
common ambiguities and omissions. We compute LDFR across both foundation and
clinical LLMs, finding that latent fragility emerges even under minimal
surface-level changes. Finally, we validate our findings on 90 real clinical
notes from the DiReCT benchmark (MIMIC-IV), confirming the generalizability of
LDFR beyond synthetic settings. Our results reveal a persistent gap between
surface robustness and semantic stability, underscoring the importance of
geometry-aware auditing in safety-critical clinical AI.

Result: 在合成图去噪和语言标记图任务中表现优于轻量级图神经网络（GNN），同时具有更高的透明性和效率。

Conclusion: 该框架为图学习提供了一种原则性、可解释且资源高效的替代方案，优于传统深度神经网络。

Abstract: We present a fully non neural learning framework based on Graph Laplacian
Wavelet Transforms (GLWT). Unlike traditional architectures that rely on
convolutional, recurrent, or attention based neural networks, our model
operates purely in the graph spectral domain using structured multiscale
filtering, nonlinear shrinkage, and symbolic logic over wavelet coefficients.
Signals defined on graph nodes are decomposed via GLWT, modulated with
interpretable nonlinearities, and recombined for downstream tasks such as
denoising and token classification. The system supports compositional reasoning
through a symbolic domain-specific language (DSL) over graph wavelet
activations. Experiments on synthetic graph denoising and linguistic token
graphs demonstrate competitive performance against lightweight GNNs with far
greater transparency and efficiency. This work proposes a principled,
interpretable, and resource-efficient alternative to deep neural architectures

Conclusion: 提出的结构学习方法能改善长距离依赖捕获，但通用性有限。

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) gained traction for graph representation
learning, with recent attention on improving performance on heterophilic graphs
for various real-world applications. The localized feature aggregation in a
typical message-passing paradigm hinders the capturing of long-range
dependencies between non-local nodes of the same class. The inherent
connectivity structure in heterophilic graphs often conflicts with information
sharing between distant nodes of same class. We propose structure learning to
rewire edges in shallow GCNs itself to avoid performance degradation in
downstream discriminative tasks due to oversmoothing. Parameterizing the
adjacency matrix to learn connections between non-local nodes and extend the
hop span of shallow GCNs facilitates the capturing of long-range dependencies.
However, our method is not generalizable across heterophilic graphs and
performs inconsistently on node classification task contingent to the graph
structure.

Abstract: We introduce EdgeAgentX-DT, an advanced extension of the EdgeAgentX framework

EdgeAgentX-DT utilizes network digital twins, virtual replicas synchronized
with real-world edge devices, to provide a secure, realistic environment for
training and validation. Leveraging generative AI methods, such as diffusion
models and transformers, the system creates diverse and adversarial scenarios
for robust simulation-based agent training. Our multi-layer architecture
includes: (1) on-device edge intelligence; (2) digital twin synchronization;
and (3) generative scenario training. Experimental simulations demonstrate
notable improvements over EdgeAgentX, including faster learning convergence,
higher network throughput, reduced latency, and improved resilience against
jamming and node failures. A case study involving a complex tactical scenario
with simultaneous jamming attacks, agent failures, and increased network loads
illustrates how EdgeAgentX-DT sustains operational performance, whereas
baseline methods fail. These results highlight the potential of

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EHR数据的复杂性和异质性限制了机器学习解释在子群建模中的效果，需要一种方法将这些解释转化为实际指导。

Abstract: Machine learning interpretation has primarily been leveraged to build
clinician trust and uncover actionable insights in EHRs. However, the intrinsic
complexity and heterogeneity of EHR data limit its effectiveness in guiding
subgroup-specific modeling. We propose AdaptHetero, a novel MLI-driven
framework that transforms interpretability insights into actionable guidance
for tailoring model training and evaluation across subpopulations within
individual hospital systems. Evaluated on three large-scale EHR datasets -
GOSSIS-1-eICU, WiDS, and MIMIC-IV - AdaptHetero consistently identifies
heterogeneous model behaviors in predicting ICU mortality, in-hospital death,
and hidden hypoxemia. By integrating SHAP-based interpretation and unsupervised
clustering, the framework enhances the identification of clinically meaningful
subgroup-specific characteristics, leading to improved predictive performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对语言模型的梯度反转攻击方法Grab，通过混合优化显著提高了私有训练数据的恢复率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 梯度反转攻击在联邦学习（FL）中对语言模型的隐私威胁被低估，本文旨在揭示其潜在风险。

Method: Grab采用两种交替优化过程：层间dropout掩码的同步优化和离散优化，以解决实际训练中的挑战。

Result: Grab在基准和实际设置中分别实现了高达92.9%和48.5%的恢复率，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Grab为理解语言模型在FL中的隐私威胁提供了重要进展。

Abstract: The gradient inversion attack has been demonstrated as a significant privacy
threat to federated learning (FL), particularly in continuous domains such as
vision models. In contrast, it is often considered less effective or highly
dependent on impractical training settings when applied to language models, due
to the challenges posed by the discrete nature of tokens in text data. As a
result, its potential privacy threats remain largely underestimated, despite FL
being an emerging training method for language models. In this work, we propose
a domain-specific gradient inversion attack named Grab (gradient inversion with
hybrid optimization). Grab features two alternating optimization processes to
address the challenges caused by practical training settings, including a
simultaneous optimization on dropout masks between layers for improved token
recovery and a discrete optimization for effective token sequencing. Grab can
recover a significant portion (up to 92.9% recovery rate) of the private
training data, outperforming the attack strategy of utilizing discrete
optimization with an auxiliary model by notable improvements of up to 28.9%
recovery rate in benchmark settings and 48.5% recovery rate in practical
settings. Grab provides a valuable step forward in understanding this privacy
threat in the emerging FL training mode of language models.

Abstract: Interactive multimodal applications (IMAs), such as route planning in the
Internet of Vehicles, enrich users' personalized experiences by integrating
various forms of data over wireless networks. Recent advances in large language
models (LLMs) utilize mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanisms to empower multiple
IMAs, with each LLM trained individually for a specific task that presents
different business workflows. In contrast to existing approaches that rely on
multiple LLMs for IMAs, this paper presents a novel paradigm that accomplishes
various IMAs using a single compositional LLM over wireless networks. The two
primary challenges include 1) guiding a single LLM to adapt to diverse IMA
objectives and 2) ensuring the flexibility and efficiency of the LLM in
resource-constrained mobile environments. To tackle the first challenge, we
propose ContextLoRA, a novel method that guides an LLM to learn the rich
structured context among IMAs by constructing a task dependency graph. We
partition the learnable parameter matrix of neural layers for each IMA to
facilitate LLM composition. Then, we develop a step-by-step fine-tuning
procedure guided by task relations, including training, freezing, and masking
phases. This allows the LLM to learn to reason among tasks for better
adaptation, capturing the latent dependencies between tasks. For the second
challenge, we introduce ContextGear, a scheduling strategy to optimize the
training procedure of ContextLoRA, aiming to minimize computational and
communication costs through a strategic grouping mechanism. Experiments on
three benchmarks show the superiority of the proposed ContextLoRA and
ContextGear. Furthermore, we prototype our proposed paradigm on a real-world
wireless testbed, demonstrating its practical applicability for various IMAs.
We will release our code to the community.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出针对现实世界数据分布不均衡和长尾问题的深度学习算法，以解决传统算法在非均衡数据上的性能不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据分布不均衡且长尾，传统算法在非均衡数据上表现不佳，需开发能直接从现实数据中学习的鲁棒算法。

Method: 分为四部分：1）从长尾数据学习生成模型；2）通过归纳正则化提升尾类泛化能力；3）半监督学习优化相关指标；4）高效域适应。

Result: 开发了能处理长尾数据、提升尾类泛化能力、优化半监督学习指标及实现高效域适应的算法。

Conclusion: 提出的算法能有效学习现实世界中的不均衡数据，减少对数据标注的依赖，扩展深度学习应用范围。

Abstract: The distribution of data in the world (eg, internet, etc.) significantly
differs from the well-curated datasets and is often over-populated with samples
from common categories. The algorithms designed for well-curated datasets
perform suboptimally when used for learning from imperfect datasets with
long-tailed imbalances and distribution shifts. To expand the use of deep
models, it is essential to overcome the labor-intensive curation process by
developing robust algorithms that can learn from diverse, real-world data
distributions. Toward this goal, we develop practical algorithms for Deep
Neural Networks which can learn from limited and imperfect data present in the
real world. This thesis is divided into four segments, each covering a scenario
of learning from limited or imperfect data. The first part of the thesis
focuses on Learning Generative Models from Long-Tail Data, where we mitigate
the mode-collapse and enable diverse aesthetic image generations for tail
(minority) classes. In the second part, we enable effective generalization on
tail classes through Inductive Regularization schemes, which allow tail classes
to generalize as effectively as the head classes without requiring explicit
generation of images. In the third part, we develop algorithms for Optimizing
Relevant Metrics for learning from long-tailed data with limited annotation
(semi-supervised), followed by the fourth part, which focuses on the Efficient
Domain Adaptation of the model to various domains with very few to zero labeled
samples.

TL;DR: RAGDP是一种无需额外训练的新框架，通过知识库加速预训练扩散策略的推理，提高准确性和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散策略（DPs）在模仿学习中表现优异，但生成动作需要多次去噪步骤，耗时较长。现有方法如一致性策略（CP）训练时间长，尤其对复杂任务。

Method: RAGDP通过构建专家演示的向量数据库，结合当前观察嵌入提取相似专家动作，减少去噪步骤。

Result: RAGDP在20倍加速下仍保持准确性优势，比CP模型高7%。

Conclusion: RAGDP在无需额外训练的情况下，显著提升了扩散策略的推理速度和准确性。

Abstract: Diffusion Policies (DPs) have attracted attention for their ability to
achieve significant accuracy improvements in various imitation learning tasks.
However, DPs depend on Diffusion Models, which require multiple noise removal
steps to generate a single action, resulting in long generation times. To solve
this problem, knowledge distillation-based methods such as Consistency Policy
(CP) have been proposed. However, these methods require a significant amount of
training time, especially for difficult tasks. In this study, we propose RAGDP
(Retrieve-Augmented Generation for Diffusion Policies) as a novel framework
that eliminates the need for additional training using a knowledge base to
expedite the inference of pre-trained DPs. In concrete, RAGDP encodes
observation-action pairs through the DP encoder to construct a vector database
of expert demonstrations. During inference, the current observation is
embedded, and the most similar expert action is extracted. This extracted
action is combined with an intermediate noise removal step to reduce the number
of steps required compared to the original diffusion step. We show that by
using RAGDP with the base model and existing acceleration methods, we improve
the accuracy and speed trade-off with no additional training. Even when
accelerating the models 20 times, RAGDP maintains an advantage in accuracy,
with a 7% increase over distillation models such as CP.

*Sheikh Md Shakeel Hassan,Xianwei Zou,Akash Dhruv,Vishwanath Ganesan,Aparna Chandramowlishwaran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bubbleformer是一种基于Transformer的时空模型，用于预测沸腾动力学，无需依赖模拟数据，解决了现有模型无法自主预测沸腾动态的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经PDE代理模型无法从过去状态学习成核现象，且无法模拟流动沸腾速度场，限制了自主预测能力。

Method: Bubbleformer结合因子化轴向注意力、频率感知缩放和热物理参数条件化，适用于多种流体、几何和操作条件。

Result: Bubbleformer在预测和预报两相沸腾流动方面设定了新的基准结果。

Conclusion: Bubbleformer通过物理保真度评估和高保真数据集BubbleML 2.0，展示了其在沸腾动力学建模中的优越性。

Abstract: Modeling boiling (an inherently chaotic, multiphase process central to energy
and thermal systems) remains a significant challenge for neural PDE surrogates.
Existing models require future input (e.g., bubble positions) during inference
because they fail to learn nucleation from past states, limiting their ability
to autonomously forecast boiling dynamics. They also fail to model flow boiling
velocity fields, where sharp interface-momentum coupling demands long-range and
directional inductive biases. We introduce Bubbleformer, a transformer-based
spatiotemporal model that forecasts stable and long-range boiling dynamics
including nucleation, interface evolution, and heat transfer without dependence
on simulation data during inference. Bubbleformer integrates factorized axial
attention, frequency-aware scaling, and conditions on thermophysical parameters
to generalize across fluids, geometries, and operating conditions. To evaluate
physical fidelity in chaotic systems, we propose interpretable physics-based
metrics that evaluate heat-flux consistency, interface geometry, and mass
conservation. We also release BubbleML 2.0, a high-fidelity dataset that spans
diverse working fluids (cryogens, refrigerants, dielectrics), boiling
configurations (pool and flow boiling), flow regimes (bubbly, slug, annular),
and boundary conditions. Bubbleformer sets new benchmark results in both
prediction and forecasting of two-phase boiling flows.

Motivation: 解决多源噪声实验数据整合到扩散模型中的挑战，避免手动调参。

Method: 提出Adam-PnP框架，结合自适应噪声估计和动态模态加权机制。

Result: 在复杂重建任务中显著提高了准确性。

Conclusion: Adam-PnP为蛋白质结构重建提供了一种高效且自动化的解决方案。

Abstract: In an inverse problem, the goal is to recover an unknown parameter (e.g., an
image) that has typically undergone some lossy or noisy transformation during
measurement. Recently, deep generative models, particularly diffusion models,
have emerged as powerful priors for protein structure generation. However,
integrating noisy experimental data from multiple sources to guide these models
remains a significant challenge. Existing methods often require precise
knowledge of experimental noise levels and manually tuned weights for each data
modality. In this work, we introduce Adam-PnP, a Plug-and-Play framework that
guides a pre-trained protein diffusion model using gradients from multiple,
heterogeneous experimental sources. Our framework features an adaptive noise
estimation scheme and a dynamic modality weighting mechanism integrated into
the diffusion process, which reduce the need for manual hyperparameter tuning.
Experiments on complex reconstruction tasks demonstrate significantly improved
accuracy using Adam-PnP.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DeepPCE的新方法，通过结合多项式混沌展开（PCE）和概率电路的思想，解决了PCE在高维问题中扩展性差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多项式混沌展开（PCE）在高维问题中因基函数数量指数增长而难以扩展，需要一种更高效的替代方法。

Method: 将PCE与概率电路结合，提出DeepPCE，一种能够有效扩展到高维输入空间的深度泛化方法。

Result: DeepPCE在预测性能上与多层感知机（MLP）相当，同时保留了PCE通过简单前向传播计算精确统计推断的能力。

Conclusion: DeepPCE是一种高效且可扩展的替代方法，适用于高维不确定性量化问题。

Abstract: Polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) is a classical and widely used surrogate
modeling technique in physical simulation and uncertainty quantification. By
taking a linear combination of a set of basis polynomials - orthonormal with
respect to the distribution of uncertain input parameters - PCE enables
tractable inference of key statistical quantities, such as (conditional) means,
variances, covariances, and Sobol sensitivity indices, which are essential for
understanding the modeled system and identifying influential parameters and
their interactions. As the number of basis functions grows exponentially with
the number of parameters, PCE does not scale well to high-dimensional problems.
We address this challenge by combining PCE with ideas from probabilistic
circuits, resulting in the deep polynomial chaos expansion (DeepPCE) - a deep
generalization of PCE that scales effectively to high-dimensional input spaces.
DeepPCE achieves predictive performance comparable to that of multi-layer
perceptrons (MLPs), while retaining PCE's ability to compute exact statistical
inferences via simple forward passes.

TL;DR: 论文提出LAAC方法，利用LLM生成新颖推荐，并通过轻量级策略优化，提升推荐系统的多样性和新颖性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐系统通常注重点击相关性，而忽视多样性和新颖性，现有RL方法依赖随机探索，可能不符合用户兴趣。

Method: LAAC结合LLM作为参考策略生成推荐，通过双层优化训练轻量级策略，并引入正则化避免LLM建议的过估计。

Result: 实验表明LAAC在多样性、新颖性和准确性上优于基线，且在数据不平衡时表现稳健。

Conclusion: LAAC有效整合LLM知识，无需昂贵微调，显著提升推荐系统性能。

Abstract: In recommendation systems, diversity and novelty are essential for capturing
varied user preferences and encouraging exploration, yet many systems
prioritize click relevance. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored
to improve diversity, it often depends on random exploration that may not align
with user interests. We propose LAAC (LLM-guided Adversarial Actor Critic), a
novel method that leverages large language models (LLMs) as reference policies
to suggest novel items, while training a lightweight policy to refine these
suggestions using system-specific data. The method formulates training as a
bilevel optimization between actor and critic networks, enabling the critic to
selectively favor promising novel actions and the actor to improve its policy
beyond LLM recommendations. To mitigate overestimation of unreliable LLM
suggestions, we apply regularization that anchors critic values for unexplored
items close to well-estimated dataset actions. Experiments on real-world
datasets show that LAAC outperforms existing baselines in diversity, novelty,
and accuracy, while remaining robust on imbalanced data, effectively
integrating LLM knowledge without expensive fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用已知物理模型（FOM）改进数据驱动技术在混沌动力学降阶建模中的预测能力。

Method: 通过自动编码器找到不变流形，将FOM的向量场投影到流形上，并用动态数据修正或作为贝叶斯先验更新。使用神经常微分方程方法。

Result: 在Kuramoto-Sivashinsky和复杂Ginzburg-Landau方程的模拟数据中，混合方法在数据丰富、稀缺甚至FOM参数错误的情况下均显著优于纯数据方法。

Conclusion: 混合方法在多种场景下均能显著提升预测能力，证明了结合物理模型与数据的有效性。

Abstract: While data-driven techniques are powerful tools for reduced-order modeling of
systems with chaotic dynamics, great potential remains for leveraging known
physics (i.e. a full-order model (FOM)) to improve predictive capability. We
develop a hybrid reduced order model (ROM), informed by both data and FOM, for
evolving spatiotemporal chaotic dynamics on an invariant manifold whose
coordinates are found using an autoencoder. This approach projects the vector
field of the FOM onto the invariant manifold; then, this physics-derived vector
field is either corrected using dynamic data, or used as a Bayesian prior that
is updated with data. In both cases, the neural ordinary differential equation
approach is used. We consider simulated data from the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and
complex Ginzburg-Landau equations. Relative to the data-only approach, for
scenarios of abundant data, scarce data, and even an incorrect FOM (i.e.
erroneous parameter values), the hybrid approach yields substantially improved
time-series predictions.

Conclusion: 该框架为弹性物体的重建和模拟提供了一种高效且物理一致的方法，结合了数据驱动学习和物理约束的优势。

Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling physical
systems, offering the ability to learn complex representations from limited
data while integrating foundational scientific knowledge. In particular,
neuro-symbolic approaches that combine data-driven learning, the neuro, with
symbolic equations and rules, the symbolic, address the tension between methods
that are purely empirical, which risk straying from established physical
principles, and traditional numerical solvers that demand complete geometric
knowledge and can be prohibitively expensive for high-fidelity simulations. In
this work, we present a novel neuro-symbolic framework for reconstructing and
simulating elastic objects directly from sparse multi-view image sequences,
without requiring explicit geometric information. Specifically, we integrate a
neural radiance field (NeRF) for object reconstruction with physics-informed
neural networks (PINN) that incorporate the governing partial differential
equations of elasticity. In doing so, our method learns a spatiotemporal
representation of deforming objects that leverages both image supervision and
symbolic physical constraints. To handle complex boundary and initial
conditions, which are traditionally confronted using finite element methods,
boundary element methods, or sensor-based measurements, we employ an
energy-constrained Physics-Informed Neural Network architecture. This design
enhances both simulation accuracy and the explainability of results.

Motivation: 深度学习模型在时间序列分类中表现优异，但在类相似性、多模态分布和噪声等挑战性数据条件下性能下降。

Method: 提出CDNet，利用卷积近似反向扩散步骤学习样本间（类内和类间）的转换，并结合不确定性加权复合损失进行鲁棒训练。

Result: 在UCR Archive和模拟数据集上的实验表明，CDNet显著提升了现有深度学习分类器的性能。

Conclusion: CDNet通过对比扩散和鲁棒训练机制，有效解决了时间序列分类中的挑战性问题。

Abstract: Deep learning models are widely used for time series classification (TSC) due
to their scalability and efficiency. However, their performance degrades under
challenging data conditions such as class similarity, multimodal distributions,
and noise. To address these limitations, we propose CDNet, a Contrastive
Diffusion-based Network that enhances existing classifiers by generating
informative positive and negative samples via a learned diffusion process.
Unlike traditional diffusion models that denoise individual samples, CDNet
learns transitions between samples--both within and across classes--through
convolutional approximations of reverse diffusion steps. We introduce a
theoretically grounded CNN-based mechanism to enable both denoising and mode
coverage, and incorporate an uncertainty-weighted composite loss for robust
training. Extensive experiments on the UCR Archive and simulated datasets
demonstrate that CDNet significantly improves state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep
learning classifiers, particularly under noisy, similar, and multimodal
conditions.

Motivation: 现有NCO求解器主要针对单车辆VRP变体，忽略了多车辆的MMHCVRP问题，且解码决策短视，未充分利用问题的关键特性。

Result: 实验表明ECHO在车辆和节点数量变化时优于现有方法，且具有良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: ECHO通过创新方法有效解决了MMHCVRP问题，并通过消融实验验证了各方法的有效性。

Abstract: Numerous Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) solvers have been proposed
to address Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). However, most of these solvers
focus exclusively on single-vehicle VRP variants, overlooking the more
realistic min-max Heterogeneous Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (MMHCVRP),
which involves multiple vehicles. Existing MMHCVRP solvers typically select a
vehicle and its next node to visit at each decoding step, but often make myopic
decoding decisions and overlook key properties of MMHCVRP, including local
topological relationships, vehicle permutation invariance, and node symmetry,
resulting in suboptimal performance. To better address these limitations, we
propose ECHO, an efficient NCO solver. First, ECHO exploits the proposed
dual-modality node encoder to capture local topological relationships among
nodes. Subsequently, to mitigate myopic decisions, ECHO employs the proposed
Parameter-Free Cross-Attention mechanism to prioritize the vehicle selected in
the preceding decoding step. Finally, leveraging vehicle permutation invariance
and node symmetry, we introduce a tailored data augment strategy for MMHCVRP to
stabilize the Reinforcement Learning training process. To assess the
performance of ECHO, we conduct extensive experiments. The experimental results
demonstrate that ECHO outperforms state-of-the-art NCO solvers across varying
numbers of vehicles and nodes, and exhibits well-performing generalization
across both scales and distribution patterns. Finally, ablation studies
validate the effectiveness of all proposed methods.

Conclusion: MOCHA算法填补了多目标强化学习中的空白，为帕累托平稳解探索提供了高效且理论支持的方法。

Abstract: In many multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) applications, being
able to systematically explore the Pareto-stationary solutions under multiple
non-convex reward objectives with theoretical finite-time sample complexity
guarantee is an important and yet under-explored problem. This motivates us to
take the first step and fill the important gap in MORL. Specifically, in this
paper, we propose a \uline{M}ulti-\uline{O}bjective weighted-\uline{CH}ebyshev
\uline{A}ctor-critic (MOCHA) algorithm for MORL, which judiciously integrates
the weighted-Chebychev (WC) and actor-critic framework to enable
Pareto-stationarity exploration systematically with finite-time sample
complexity guarantee. Sample complexity result of MOCHA algorithm reveals an
interesting dependency on $p_{\min}$ in finding an $\epsilon$-Pareto-stationary
solution, where $p_{\min}$ denotes the minimum entry of a given weight vector
$\mathbf{p}$ in WC-scarlarization. By carefully choosing learning rates, the
sample complexity for each exploration can be
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$. Furthermore, simulation studies on a
large KuaiRand offline dataset, show that the performance of MOCHA algorithm
significantly outperforms other baseline MORL approaches.

Motivation: 揭示LIT-PCBA数据集的问题，证明其不适合作为虚拟筛选的基准，并呼吁开发更可靠的数据集。

Method: 通过审计数据集，识别数据泄漏、重复和结构冗余问题，并设计一个基于记忆的基线模型验证这些问题的影响。

Result: 发现大量数据泄漏和重复，导致模型通过记忆而非泛化取得虚假的高性能。基线模型甚至优于现有先进模型。

Conclusion: LIT-PCBA数据集存在根本性缺陷，不适合作为基准，需开发更严谨的数据集。

Abstract: LIT-PCBA is a widely used benchmark for virtual screening, but our audit
reveals it is fundamentally compromised. The dataset suffers from egregious
data leakage, rampant duplication, and pervasive analog redundancy -- flaws
that invalidate its use for fair model evaluation. Notably, we identify 2,491
inactives duplicated across training and validation sets, and thousands more
repeated within individual data splits (2,945 in training, 789 in validation).
Critically, three ligands in the query set -- meant to represent unseen test
cases -- are leaked: two appear in the training set, one in validation.
Structural redundancy compounds these issues: for some targets, over 80% of
query ligands are near duplicates, with Tanimoto similarity >= 0.9. In ALDH1
alone, we find 323 highly similar active pairs between training and validation
sets, invalidating claims of chemical diversity. These and other flaws
collectively cause models trained on LIT-PCBA to memorize rather than
generalize. To demonstrate the consequences of these data integrity failures,
we implement a trivial memorization-based baseline -- using no learning, no
physics, and no modeling -- that outperforms state-of-the-art models, including
deep neural networks like CHEESE, on LIT-PCBA simply by exploiting these
artifacts. Our findings render the benchmark unfit for its intended purpose and
call into question previous results based on its use. We share this audit to
raise awareness and provide tooling to help the community develop more rigorous
and reliable datasets going forward. All scripts necessary to reproduce our
audit and the baseline implementation are available at:

Conclusion: 扭矩驱动的分层重连策略有效提升了GNNs在复杂图结构中的性能。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning from
graph-structured data, leveraging message passing to diffuse information and
update node representations. However, most efforts have suggested that native
interactions encoded in the graph may not be friendly for this process,
motivating the development of graph rewiring methods. In this work, we propose
a torque-driven hierarchical rewiring strategy, inspired by the notion of
torque in classical mechanics, dynamically modulating message passing to
improve representation learning in heterophilous graphs and enhance robustness
against noisy graphs. Specifically, we define an interference-aware torque
metric that integrates structural distance and energy scores to quantify the
perturbation induced by edges, thereby encouraging each node to aggregate
information from its nearest low-energy neighbors. We use the metric to
hierarchically reconfigure the receptive field of each layer by judiciously
pruning high-torque edges and adding low-torque links, suppressing propagation
noise and boosting pertinent signals. Extensive evaluations on benchmark
datasets show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods on both
heterophilous and homophilous graphs, and maintains high accuracy on noisy
graph.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在推理过程中生成冗长的思维链序列，导致内存开销大。观察到中间推理步骤高度相似，对应相似的KV缓存状态，因此提出MemShare。

Method: MemShare采用协同过滤算法识别可重用的KV缓存块，并实现零拷贝缓存重用。

Result: 实验表明，MemShare在保持准确性的同时，吞吐量提升高达84.79%。

Conclusion: MemShare有效减少内存开销，提高推理效率，优于现有KV缓存管理方法。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved significant advances in
mathematical reasoning and formal logic tasks. However, their tendency to
generate lengthy chain-of-thought sequences leads to substantial memory
overhead during inference. We observe that LRMs frequently produce highly
similar intermediate reasoning steps, which correspond to similar KV cache
states across layers. Motivated by this observation, we propose MemShare, a
novel KV cache management approach that effectively reduces memory overhead.
MemShare employs a collaborative filtering algorithm to efficiently identify
reusable KV cache blocks and enables zero copy cache reuse to significantly
reduce memory overhead, improve throughput while maintaining accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate that MemShare delivers up to 84.79\%
improvement in throughput while maintaining better accuracy compared to

*Tiantian Sun,Jian Zu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了两种新框架PVD-Net和PVD-ONet，用于解决奇异摄动问题，无需数据仅依赖控制方程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有物理信息神经网络在奇异摄动问题上难以收敛，需改进。

Method: PVD-Net采用两网络架构（稳定性优先）和五网络架构（高精度优先）；PVD-ONet扩展为算子学习框架。

Result: 数值实验表明新方法在多种误差指标下优于现有基线。

Conclusion: PVD-Net和PVD-ONet为多尺度问题提供了高效新方法。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks and Physics-informed DeepONet excel in
solving partial differential equations; however, they often fail to converge
for singularly perturbed problems. To address this, we propose two novel
frameworks, Prandtl-Van Dyke neural network (PVD-Net) and its operator learning
extension Prandtl-Van Dyke Deep Operator Network (PVD-ONet), which rely solely
on governing equations without data. To address varying task-specific
requirements, both PVD-Net and PVD-ONet are developed in two distinct versions,
tailored respectively for stability-focused and high-accuracy modeling. The
leading-order PVD-Net adopts a two-network architecture combined with Prandtl's
matching condition, targeting stability-prioritized scenarios. The high-order
PVD-Net employs a five-network design with Van Dyke's matching principle to
capture fine-scale boundary layer structures, making it ideal for high-accuracy
scenarios. PVD-ONet generalizes PVD-Net to the operator learning setting by
assembling multiple DeepONet modules, directly mapping initial conditions to
solution operators and enabling instant predictions for an entire family of
boundary layer problems without retraining. Numerical experiments on various
models show that our proposed methods consistently outperform existing
baselines under various error metrics, thereby offering a powerful new approach
for multi-scale problems.

*Wenxuan Bao,Ruxi Deng,Ruizhong Qiu,Tianxin Wei,Hanghang Tong,Jingrui He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Latte是一个基于预训练视觉语言模型的新框架，通过本地和外部内存存储历史测试数据，解决分布式学习中的个性化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时适应方法在分布式学习中面临数据不足和个性化不足的问题。

Method: Latte通过本地内存存储自身历史数据，外部内存存储相关客户端的类原型，结合嵌入相似性和不确定性进行模型优化。

Result: 实验证明Latte在分布式环境中表现优异，且通信和计算成本极低。

Conclusion: Latte有效解决了分布式学习中的个性化问题，性能优越且成本低。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation with pre-trained vision-language models has gained
increasing attention for addressing distribution shifts during testing. Among
these approaches, memory-based algorithms stand out due to their training-free
nature and ability to leverage historical test data. However, existing
test-time adaptation methods are typically designed for a single domain with
abundant data. In decentralized settings such as federated learning, applying
these methods individually to each client suffers from limited test data, while
directly sharing a single global memory via the server prevents proper
personalization to each client's unique distribution. To address this, we
propose Latte, a novel framework where each client maintains a local memory to
store embeddings from its own historical test data and an external memory to
store class prototypes from other relevant clients. During communication, each
client retrieves prototypes from similar clients under the server's
coordination to expand its memory. For local adaptation, Latte utilizes both
embedding similarity and uncertainty to enhance model performance. Our
theoretical analysis shows that Latte effectively leverages in-distribution
clients while remaining robust to out-of-distribution clients. Extensive
experiments on domain adaptation and corruption benchmarks validate that Latte
achieves superior performance in decentralized settings, while introducing only
negligible communication and computation costs. Our code is available at

Abstract: The rise of LLM-based agents has opened new frontiers in AI applications, yet
evaluating these agents remains a complex and underdeveloped area. This survey
provides an in-depth overview of the emerging field of LLM agent evaluation,
introducing a two-dimensional taxonomy that organizes existing work along (1)
evaluation objectives -- what to evaluate, such as agent behavior,
capabilities, reliability, and safety -- and (2) evaluation process -- how to
evaluate, including interaction modes, datasets and benchmarks, metric
computation methods, and tooling. In addition to taxonomy, we highlight
enterprise-specific challenges, such as role-based access to data, the need for
reliability guarantees, dynamic and long-horizon interactions, and compliance,
which are often overlooked in current research. We also identify future
research directions, including holistic, more realistic, and scalable
evaluation. This work aims to bring clarity to the fragmented landscape of
agent evaluation and provide a framework for systematic assessment, enabling
researchers and practitioners to evaluate LLM agents for real-world deployment.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的分层随机微分方程（SDE）模型，用于高效且可解释地建模高维神经时间序列的低维流形结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在计算效率和可解释性上存在局限，需要一种能平衡两者的新模型来揭示神经时间序列的低维流形结构。

Method: 使用布朗桥SDE建模潜在空间，通过多元标记点过程采样时间和值点，定义第二组SDE的漂移，映射到观测数据。

Result: 模型能准确恢复底层流形结构，计算成本随数据长度线性增长，适用于高维数据。

Conclusion: 该模型在合成数据和神经记录中验证了其有效性，为复杂时间序列建模提供了新工具。

Abstract: The manifold hypothesis suggests that high-dimensional neural time series lie
on a low-dimensional manifold shaped by simpler underlying dynamics. To uncover
this structure, latent dynamical variable models such as state-space models,
recurrent neural networks, neural ordinary differential equations, and Gaussian
Process Latent Variable Models are widely used. We propose a novel hierarchical
stochastic differential equation (SDE) model that balances computational
efficiency and interpretability, addressing key limitations of existing
methods. Our model assumes the trajectory of a manifold can be reconstructed
from a sparse set of samples from the manifold trajectory. The latent space is
modeled using Brownian bridge SDEs, with points - specified in both time and
value - sampled from a multivariate marked point process. These Brownian
bridges define the drift of a second set of SDEs, which are then mapped to the
observed data. This yields a continuous, differentiable latent process capable
of modeling arbitrarily complex time series as the number of manifold points
increases. We derive training and inference procedures and show that the
computational cost of inference scales linearly with the length of the
observation data. We then validate our model on both synthetic data and neural
recordings to demonstrate that it accurately recovers the underlying manifold
structure and scales effectively with data dimensionality.

Method: 通过扩展和创建新数据集，验证简单分类分布输出的竞争力。

Result: 研究发现，简单分类分布在多种数据集中表现优异，且现有数据集可能掩盖了事件生成过程的真实信息。

Conclusion: 结论表明，简单输出结构在神经时间点过程模型中具有广泛适用性，且现有模型的性能可能依赖于正则化效应和输出结构限制。

Abstract: We demonstrate the effectiveness of using a simple neural network output, a
categorical probability distribution, for the task of next spike prediction.
This case study motivates an investigation into why this simple output
structure is not commonly used with neural temporal point process models. We
find evidence that many existing datasets for evaluating temporal point process
models do not reveal much information about the underlying event generating
processes, and many existing models perform well due to regularization effects
of model size and constraints on output structure. We extend existing datasets
and create new ones in order to explore outside of this information limited
regime and find that outputting a simple categorical distribution is
competitive across a wide range of datasets.

Motivation: 当前基因组序列建模方法难以将机器学习模型的归纳偏置与生物系统的进化结构对齐，因此需要一种更有效的方法来捕捉序列的功能和调控特性。

Method: 采用双曲卷积神经网络，无需显式系统发育映射，直接学习序列的关键特性。

Result: 在42个基因组解释基准数据集中，37个表现优于欧几里得模型，并在7个GUE基准数据集上超越现有技术，同时参数更少且无需预训练。

Conclusion: 双曲框架为基因组表示学习提供了稳健的范式，具有显著潜力。

Abstract: Current approaches to genomic sequence modeling often struggle to align the
inductive biases of machine learning models with the evolutionarily-informed
structure of biological systems. To this end, we formulate a novel application
of hyperbolic CNNs that exploits this structure, enabling more expressive DNA
sequence representations. Our strategy circumvents the need for explicit
phylogenetic mapping while discerning key properties of sequences pertaining to
core functional and regulatory behavior. Across 37 out of 42 genome
interpretation benchmark datasets, our hyperbolic models outperform their
Euclidean equivalents. Notably, our approach even surpasses state-of-the-art
performance on seven GUE benchmark datasets, consistently outperforming many
DNA language models while using orders of magnitude fewer parameters and
avoiding pretraining. Our results include a novel set of benchmark
datasets--the Transposable Elements Benchmark--which explores a major but
understudied component of the genome with deep evolutionary significance. We
further motivate our work by exploring how our hyperbolic models recognize
genomic signal under various data-generating conditions and by constructing an
empirical method for interpreting the hyperbolicity of dataset embeddings.
Throughout these assessments, we find persistent evidence highlighting the
potential of our hyperbolic framework as a robust paradigm for genome
representation learning. Our code and benchmark datasets are available at

Motivation: 现有基于文本提示的图增强LLMs在异构欺诈检测图中表现不佳，多跳关系导致提示过长且关键信号被淹没。

Method: DGP通过针对不同数据模态的定制化汇总策略（文本字段的双层语义抽象和数值特征的统计聚合），压缩邻居信息为简洁提示。

Result: 实验表明，DGP在可控的token预算内，将欺诈检测性能提升高达6.8%（AUPRC）。

Conclusion: DGP展示了图增强LLMs在欺诈检测中的潜力，有效解决了信息过载问题。

Abstract: Real-world fraud detection applications benefit from graph learning
techniques that jointly exploit node features, often rich in textual data, and
graph structural information. Recently, Graph-Enhanced LLMs emerge as a
promising graph learning approach that converts graph information into prompts,
exploiting LLMs' ability to reason over both textual and structural
information. Among them, text-only prompting, which converts graph information
to prompts consisting solely of text tokens, offers a solution that relies only
on LLM tuning without requiring additional graph-specific encoders. However,
text-only prompting struggles on heterogeneous fraud-detection graphs:
multi-hop relations expand exponentially with each additional hop, leading to
rapidly growing neighborhoods associated with dense textual information. These
neighborhoods may overwhelm the model with long, irrelevant content in the
prompt and suppress key signals from the target node, thereby degrading
performance. To address this challenge, we propose Dual Granularity Prompting
(DGP), which mitigates information overload by preserving fine-grained textual
details for the target node while summarizing neighbor information into
coarse-grained text prompts. DGP introduces tailored summarization strategies
for different data modalities, bi-level semantic abstraction for textual fields
and statistical aggregation for numerical features, enabling effective
compression of verbose neighbor content into concise, informative prompts.
Experiments across public and industrial datasets demonstrate that DGP operates
within a manageable token budget while improving fraud detection performance by
up to 6.8% (AUPRC) over state-of-the-art methods, showing the potential of
Graph-Enhanced LLMs for fraud detection.

Conclusion: 该分析为机器学习的不确定性量化提供了理论支持，并证明了这些条件是模型具有有效概率解释的必要条件。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is often viewed as a powerful data analysis tool that
is easy to learn because of its black-box nature. Yet this very nature also
makes it difficult to quantify confidence in predictions extracted from ML
models, and more fundamentally, to understand how such models are mathematical
abstractions of training data. The goal of this paper is to unravel these
issues and their connections to uncertainty quantification (UQ) by pursuing a
line of reasoning motivated by diagnostics. In such settings, prevalence - i.e.
the fraction of elements in class - is often of inherent interest. Here we
analyze the many interpretations of prevalence to derive a level-set theory of
classification, which shows that certain types of self-consistent ML models are
equivalent to class-conditional probability distributions. We begin by studying
the properties of binary Bayes optimal classifiers, recognizing that their
boundary sets can be reinterpreted as level-sets of pairwise density ratios. By
parameterizing Bayes classifiers in terms of the prevalence, we then show that
they satisfy important monotonicity and class-switching properties that can be
used to deduce the density ratios without direct access to the boundary sets.
Moreover, this information is sufficient for tasks such as constructing the
multiclass Bayes-optimal classifier and estimating inherent uncertainty in the
class assignments. In the multiclass case, we use these results to deduce
normalization and self-consistency conditions, the latter being equivalent to
the law of total probability for classifiers. We also show that these are
necessary conditions for arbitrary ML models to have valid probabilistic
interpretations. Throughout we demonstrate how this analysis informs the
broader task of UQ for ML via an uncertainty propagation framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商品需求预测面临市场波动和非线性依赖等挑战，传统方法难以满足经济一致性需求。

Method: PREIG整合GRU和PINN，通过自定义损失函数嵌入价格与需求的负弹性约束，并采用混合优化策略（NAdam、L-BFGS和POP）。

Result: PREIG在多个商品数据集上显著优于传统计量模型（ARIMA、GARCH）和深度学习基线（BPNN、RNN），同时保持良好可解释性。

Conclusion: PREIG通过融合领域知识、优化理论和深度学习，为高维非线性时间序列预测提供了稳健、可解释且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately forecasting commodity demand remains a critical challenge due to
volatile market dynamics, nonlinear dependencies, and the need for economically
consistent predictions. This paper introduces PREIG, a novel deep learning
framework tailored for commodity demand forecasting. The model uniquely
integrates a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architecture with physics-informed
neural network (PINN) principles by embedding a domain-specific economic
constraint: the negative elasticity between price and demand. This constraint
is enforced through a customized loss function that penalizes violations of the
physical rule, ensuring that model predictions remain interpretable and aligned
with economic theory. To further enhance predictive performance and stability,
PREIG incorporates a hybrid optimization strategy that couples NAdam and L-BFGS
with Population-Based Training (POP). Experiments across multiple commodities
datasets demonstrate that PREIG significantly outperforms traditional
econometric models (ARIMA,GARCH) and deep learning baselines (BPNN,RNN) in both
RMSE and MAPE. When compared with GRU,PREIG maintains good explainability while
still performing well in prediction. By bridging domain knowledge, optimization
theory and deep learning, PREIG provides a robust, interpretable, and scalable
solution for high-dimensional nonlinear time series forecasting in economy.

Conclusion: 该模型通过嵌入物理知识到机器学习中，有望加速新型氢氟烯烃制冷剂的发现。

Abstract: Hydrofluoroolefins are considered the most promising next-generation
refrigerants due to their extremely low global warming potential values, which
can effectively mitigate the global warming effect. However, the lack of
reliable thermodynamic data hinders the discovery and application of newer and
superior hydrofluoroolefin refrigerants. In this work, integrating the
strengths of theoretical method and data-driven method, we proposed a neural
network extended corresponding state model to predict the residual
thermodynamic properties of hydrofluoroolefin refrigerants. The innovation is
that the fluids are characterized through their microscopic molecular
structures by the inclusion of graph neural network module and the specialized
design of model architecture to enhance its generalization ability. The
proposed model is trained using the highly accurate data of available known
fluids, and evaluated via the leave-one-out cross-validation method. Compared
to conventional extended corresponding state models or cubic equation of state,
the proposed model shows significantly improved accuracy for density and energy
properties in liquid and supercritical regions, with average absolute deviation
of 1.49% (liquid) and 2.42% (supercritical) for density, 3.37% and 2.50% for
residual entropy, 1.85% and 1.34% for residual enthalpy. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of embedding physics knowledge into the machine
learning model. The proposed neural network extended corresponding state model
is expected to significantly accelerate the discovery of novel
hydrofluoroolefin refrigerants.

Result: 实验验证了ZS-PAG在多种基准测试中的有效性和优越性，显著提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: ZS-PAG为零样本机器遗忘提供了一种高效且理论保证的解决方案，解决了过遗忘问题。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific samples from a
trained model. A key challenge in this process is over-unlearning, where the
model's performance on the remaining data significantly drops due to the change
in the model's parameters. Existing unlearning algorithms depend on the
remaining data to prevent this issue. As such, these methods are inapplicable
in a more practical scenario, where only the unlearning samples are available
(i.e., zero-shot unlearning). This paper presents a novel framework, ZS-PAG, to
fill this gap. Our approach offers three key innovations: (1) we approximate
the inaccessible remaining data by generating adversarial samples; (2)
leveraging the generated samples, we pinpoint a specific subspace to perform
the unlearning process, therefore preventing over-unlearning in the challenging
zero-shot scenario; and (3) we consider the influence of the unlearning process
on the remaining samples and design an influence-based pseudo-labeling
strategy. As a result, our method further improves the model's performance
after unlearning. The proposed method holds a theoretical guarantee, and
experiments on various benchmarks validate the effectiveness and superiority of
our proposed method over several baselines.

Conclusion: 模板生成建模是计算机辅助合成规划中的强大范式。

Abstract: Retrosynthesis planning remains a central challenge in molecular discovery
due to the vast and complex chemical reaction space. While traditional
template-based methods offer tractability, they suffer from poor scalability
and limited generalization, and template-free generative approaches risk
generating invalid reactions. In this work, we propose TempRe, a generative
framework that reformulates template-based approaches as sequence generation,
enabling scalable, flexible, and chemically plausible retrosynthesis. We
evaluated TempRe across single-step and multi-step retrosynthesis tasks,
demonstrating its superiority over both template classification and
SMILES-based generation methods. On the PaRoutes multi-step benchmark, TempRe
achieves strong top-k route accuracy. Furthermore, we extend TempRe to direct
multi-step synthesis route generation, providing a lightweight and efficient
alternative to conventional single-step and search-based approaches. These
results highlight the potential of template generative modeling as a powerful
paradigm in computer-aided synthesis planning.

Conclusion: RF-CRATE在保持高性能的同时提供完全数学可解释性，适用于安全敏感的物理应用。

Abstract: The empirical success of deep learning has spurred its application to the
radio-frequency (RF) domain, leading to significant advances in Deep Wireless
Sensing (DWS). However, most existing DWS models function as black boxes with
limited interpretability, which hampers their generalizability and raises
concerns in security-sensitive physical applications. In this work, inspired by
the remarkable advances of white-box transformers, we present RF-CRATE, the
first mathematically interpretable deep network architecture for RF sensing,
grounded in the principles of complex sparse rate reduction. To accommodate the
unique RF signals, we conduct non-trivial theoretical derivations that extend
the original real-valued white-box transformer to the complex domain. By
leveraging the CR-Calculus framework, we successfully construct a fully
complex-valued white-box transformer with theoretically derived self-attention
and residual multi-layer perceptron modules. Furthermore, to improve the
model's ability to extract discriminative features from limited wireless data,
we introduce Subspace Regularization, a novel regularization strategy that
enhances feature diversity, resulting in an average performance improvement of
19.98% across multiple sensing tasks. We extensively evaluate RF-CRATE against
seven baselines with multiple public and self-collected datasets involving
different RF signals. The results show that RF-CRATE achieves performance on
par with thoroughly engineered black-box models, while offering full
mathematical interpretability. More importantly, by extending CRATE to the
complex domain, RF-CRATE yields substantial improvements, achieving an average
classification gain of 5.08% and reducing regression error by 10.34% across
diverse sensing tasks compared to CRATE. RF-CRATE is fully open-sourced at:

Conclusion: 贝叶斯优化结合新型随机模型为CCS技术优化提供了新思路，有望成为能源行业可持续发展的优选方法。

Abstract: Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) stands as a pivotal technology for fostering
a sustainable future. The process, which involves injecting supercritical
CO$_2$ into underground formations, a method already widely used for Enhanced
Oil Recovery, serves a dual purpose: it not only curbs CO$_2$ emissions and
addresses climate change but also extends the operational lifespan and
sustainability of oil fields and platforms, easing the shift toward greener
practices. This paper delivers a thorough comparative evaluation of strategies
for optimizing decision variables in CCS project development, employing a
derivative-free technique known as Bayesian Optimization. In addition to
Gaussian Processes, which usually serve as the gold standard in BO, various
novel stochastic models were examined and compared within a BO framework. This
research investigates the effectiveness of utilizing more exotic stochastic
models than GPs for BO in environments where GPs have been shown to
underperform, such as in cases with a large number of decision variables or
multiple objective functions that are not similarly scaled. By incorporating
Net Present Value (NPV) as a key objective function, the proposed framework
demonstrates its potential to improve economic viability while ensuring the
sustainable deployment of CCS technologies. Ultimately, this study represents
the first application in the reservoir engineering industry of the growing body
of BO research, specifically in the search for more appropriate stochastic

*Taeyoung Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过有效场论分析FNOs在无限维函数空间中的行为，揭示了非线性激活如何耦合频率输入到高频模式，并提出了权重初始化的临界条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FNOs在高维偏微分方程中表现出色，但其稳定性、泛化性和频率行为缺乏理论解释，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用有效场论方法，推导层核和四点顶点的封闭递推关系，分析三种实际场景：解析激活、尺度不变性和残差连接架构。

Result: 理论表明非线性激活会耦合频率输入到高频模式，实验验证了频率转移现象；同时提出了权重初始化的临界条件。

Conclusion: 非线性使FNOs能捕捉非平凡特征，尺度不变激活和残差连接增强了特征学习，为超参数选择提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) have emerged as leading surrogates for
high-dimensional partial-differential equations, yet their stability,
generalization and frequency behavior lack a principled explanation. We present
the first systematic effective-field-theory analysis of FNOs in an
infinite-dimensional function space, deriving closed recursion relations for
the layer kernel and four-point vertex and then examining three practically
important settings-analytic activations, scale-invariant cases and
architectures with residual connections. The theory shows that nonlinear
activations inevitably couple frequency inputs to high-frequency modes that are
otherwise discarded by spectral truncation, and experiments confirm this
frequency transfer. For wide networks we obtain explicit criticality conditions
on the weight-initialization ensemble that keep small input perturbations to
have uniform scale across depth, and empirical tests validate these
predictions. Taken together, our results quantify how nonlinearity enables
neural operators to capture non-trivial features, supply criteria for
hyper-parameter selection via criticality analysis, and explain why
scale-invariant activations and residual connections enhance feature learning
in FNOs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种无监督参数估计方法，通过近似通用解和样条变换线性估计ODE系数，提高模型准确性和稀疏性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用预设函数形式或基函数，导致模型缺乏物理意义和可解释性，无法反映真实物理系统。

Method: 首先找到近似通用解，然后通过样条变换线性估计ODE系数；利用通用齐次线性常系数ODE的解析解形式。

Result: 方法能高精度发现ODE，且无需正则化即可实现解的稀疏性，对噪声数据具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为数据驱动技术在实际实验中的应用提供了可能，有助于物理现象的学习。

Abstract: The data-driven discovery of interpretable models approximating the
underlying dynamics of a physical system has gained attraction in the past
decade. Current approaches employ pre-specified functional forms or basis
functions and often result in models that lack physical meaning and
interpretability, let alone represent the true physics of the system. We
propose an unsupervised parameter estimation methodology that first finds an
approximate general solution, followed by a spline transformation to linearly
estimate the coefficients of the governing ordinary differential equation
(ODE). The approximate general solution is postulated using the same functional
form as the analytical solution of a general homogeneous, linear,
constant-coefficient ODE. An added advantage is its ability to produce a
high-fidelity, smooth functional form even in the presence of noisy data. The
spline approximation obtains gradient information from the functional form
which are linearly independent and creates the basis of the gradient matrix.
This gradient matrix is used in a linear system to find the coefficients of the
ODEs. From the case studies, we observed that our modeling approach discovers
ODEs with high accuracy and also promotes sparsity in the solution without
using any regularization techniques. The methodology is also robust to noisy
data and thus allows the integration of data-driven techniques into real
experimental setting for data-driven learning of physical phenomena.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a main cause of mortality globally,
accounting for 31% of all deaths. This study involves a cardiovascular disease
(CVD) dataset comprising 68,119 records to explore the influence of numerical
(age, height, weight, blood pressure, BMI) and categorical gender, cholesterol,
glucose, smoking, alcohol, activity) factors on CVD occurrence. We have
performed statistical analyses, including t-tests, Chi-square tests, and ANOVA,
to identify strong associations between CVD and elderly people, hypertension,
higher weight, and abnormal cholesterol levels, while physical activity (a
protective factor). A logistic regression model highlights age, blood pressure,
and cholesterol as primary risk factors, with unexpected negative associations
for smoking and alcohol, suggesting potential data issues. Model performance
comparisons reveal CatBoost as the top performer with an accuracy of 0.734 and
an ECE of 0.0064 and excels in probabilistic prediction (Brier score = 0.1824).

Motivation: 传统方法依赖单状态预测的聚合，实验成功率低，无法满足多构象蛋白质设计需求。

Method: DynamicMPNN通过联合学习46,033个构象对，覆盖75%的CATH超家族，并利用AlphaFold初始猜测进行评估。

Result: DynamicMPNN在结构归一化RMSD上比ProteinMPNN提升高达13%。

Conclusion: DynamicMPNN为多构象蛋白质设计提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Structural biology has long been dominated by the one sequence, one
structure, one function paradigm, yet many critical biological processes - from
enzyme catalysis to membrane transport - depend on proteins that adopt multiple
conformational states. Existing multi-state design approaches rely on post-hoc
aggregation of single-state predictions, achieving poor experimental success
rates compared to single-state design. We introduce DynamicMPNN, an inverse
folding model explicitly trained to generate sequences compatible with multiple
conformations through joint learning across conformational ensembles. Trained
on 46,033 conformational pairs covering 75% of CATH superfamilies and evaluated
using AlphaFold initial guess, DynamicMPNN outperforms ProteinMPNN by up to 13%
on structure-normalized RMSD across our challenging multi-state protein
benchmark.

Abstract: Cloud computing offers on-demand resource access, regulated by Service-Level
Agreements (SLAs) between consumers and Cloud Service Providers (CSPs). SLA
violations can impact efficiency and CSP profitability. In this work, we
propose an SLA-aware automated algorithm-selection framework for combinatorial
optimization problems in resource-constrained cloud environments. The framework
uses an ensemble of machine learning models to predict performance and rank
algorithm-hardware pairs based on SLA constraints. We also apply our framework
to the 0-1 knapsack problem. We curate a dataset comprising instance specific
features along with memory usage, runtime, and optimality gap for 6 algorithms.
As an empirical benchmark, we evaluate the framework on both classification and
regression tasks. Our ablation study explores the impact of hyperparameters,
learning approaches, and large language models effectiveness in regression, and
SHAP-based interpretability.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了RL训练的LLM在广告生成中的经济影响，发现AdLlama模型通过RLPF方法显著提升了点击率和广告主满意度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化RL在LLM后训练中的经济影响，填补研究空白。

Method: 引入RLPF方法，利用历史广告表现数据作为奖励信号，进行大规模A/B测试。

Result: AdLlama提升点击率6.7%，广告主生成更多广告变体，满意度提高。

Conclusion: RLPF是连接语言模型与实际效果的有效方法，具有推广潜力。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI), in particular large language models
(LLMs), is poised to drive transformative economic change. LLMs are pre-trained
on vast text data to learn general language patterns, but a subsequent
post-training phase is critical to align them for specific real-world tasks.
Reinforcement learning (RL) is the leading post-training technique, yet its
economic impact remains largely underexplored and unquantified. We examine this
question through the lens of the first deployment of an RL-trained LLM for
generative advertising on Facebook. Integrated into Meta's Text Generation
feature, our model, "AdLlama," powers an AI tool that helps advertisers create
new variations of human-written ad text. To train this model, we introduce
reinforcement learning with performance feedback (RLPF), a post-training method
that uses historical ad performance data as a reward signal. In a large-scale
10-week A/B test on Facebook spanning nearly 35,000 advertisers and 640,000 ad
variations, we find that AdLlama improves click-through rates by 6.7%
(p=0.0296) compared to a supervised imitation model trained on curated ads.
This represents a substantial improvement in advertiser return on investment on
Facebook. We also find that advertisers who used AdLlama generated more ad
variations, indicating higher satisfaction with the model's outputs. To our
knowledge, this is the largest study to date on the use of generative AI in an
ecologically valid setting, offering an important data point quantifying the
tangible impact of RL post-training. Furthermore, the results show that RLPF is
a promising and generalizable approach for metric-driven post-training that
bridges the gap between highly capable language models and tangible outcomes.

Method: 使用ResNet50和DenseNet-161作为教师模型，通过课程切换和联合优化策略训练轻量级学生模型，生成对抗样本并评估其效果。

Result: 学生模型的攻击成功率与集成方法相当，生成时间减少六倍；低温和硬标签监督显著提升可迁移性。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏不仅可用于模型压缩，还能高效提升黑盒对抗攻击的效果。

Abstract: We investigate whether knowledge distillation (KD) from multiple
heterogeneous teacher models can enhance the generation of transferable
adversarial examples. A lightweight student model is trained using two KD
strategies: curriculum-based switching and joint optimization, with ResNet50
and DenseNet-161 as teachers. The trained student is then used to generate
adversarial examples using FG, FGS, and PGD attacks, which are evaluated
against a black-box target model (GoogLeNet). Our results show that student
models distilled from multiple teachers achieve attack success rates comparable
to ensemble-based baselines, while reducing adversarial example generation time
by up to a factor of six. An ablation study further reveals that lower
temperature settings and the inclusion of hard-label supervision significantly
enhance transferability. These findings suggest that KD can serve not only as a
model compression technique but also as a powerful tool for improving the
efficiency and effectiveness of black-box adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: 矿物元素谱结合机器学习方法可用于高效识别蜂蜜的花源和地理来源。

Abstract: This paper proposes a machine learning-based approach for identifying honey
floral and geographical sources using mineral element profiles. The proposed
method comprises two steps: preprocessing and classification. The preprocessing
phase involves missing-value treatment and data normalization. In the
classification phase, we employ various supervised classification models for
discriminating between six botanical sources and 13 geographical origins of
honey. We test the classifiers' performance on a publicly available honey
mineral element dataset. The dataset contains mineral element profiles of
honeys from various floral and geographical origins. Results show that mineral
element content in honey provides discriminative information useful for
classifying honey botanical and geographical sources. Results also show that
the Random Forests (RF) classifier obtains the best performance on this
dataset, achieving a cross-validation accuracy of 99.30% for classifying honey
botanical origins and 98.01% for classifying honey geographical origins.

Result: DRL在多种场景中表现优于或接近传统方法，且无需复杂调参。结构感知技术进一步提升了策略的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Conclusion: DRL在库存管理中实现了数据驱动与理论分析的结合，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
to classical inventory management problems, with a focus on practical
implementation considerations. We apply a DRL algorithm based on DirectBackprop
to several fundamental inventory management scenarios including multi-period
systems with lost sales (with and without lead times), perishable inventory
management, dual sourcing, and joint inventory procurement and removal. The DRL
approach learns policies across products using only historical information that
would be available in practice, avoiding unrealistic assumptions about demand
distributions or access to distribution parameters. We demonstrate that our
generic DRL implementation performs competitively against or outperforms
established benchmarks and heuristics across these diverse settings, while
requiring minimal parameter tuning. Through examination of the learned
policies, we show that the DRL approach naturally captures many known
structural properties of optimal policies derived from traditional operations
research methods. To further improve policy performance and interpretability,
we propose a Structure-Informed Policy Network technique that explicitly
incorporates analytically-derived characteristics of optimal policies into the
learning process. This approach can help interpretability and add robustness to
the policy in out-of-sample performance, as we demonstrate in an example with
realistic demand data. Finally, we provide an illustrative application of DRL
in a non-stationary setting. Our work bridges the gap between data-driven
learning and analytical insights in inventory management while maintaining
practical applicability.

Motivation: 解决连续时间深度学习模型（如神经ODE）在训练中学习表达性强且稳定的时变权重的挑战。

Method: 采用多项式基函数（单项式和Legendre多项式）约束权重的时变演化，并在神经ODE和ResNet架构中评估其性能。

Result: Legendre基在训练稳定性、计算成本和准确性上优于单项基和无约束权重模型。

Conclusion: 正交多项式基（如Legendre基）在模型表达性和训练效率之间提供了更好的平衡。

Abstract: Continuous-time deep learning models, such as neural ordinary differential
equations (ODEs), offer a promising framework for surrogate modeling of complex
physical systems. A central challenge in training these models lies in learning
expressive yet stable time-varying weights, particularly under computational
constraints. This work investigates weight parameterization strategies that
constrain the temporal evolution of weights to a low-dimensional subspace
spanned by polynomial basis functions. We evaluate both monomial and Legendre
polynomial bases within neural ODE and residual network (ResNet) architectures
under discretize-then-optimize and optimize-then-discretize training paradigms.
Experimental results across three high-dimensional benchmark problems show that
Legendre parameterizations yield more stable training dynamics, reduce
computational cost, and achieve accuracy comparable to or better than both
monomial parameterizations and unconstrained weight models. These findings
elucidate the role of basis choice in time-dependent weight parameterization
and demonstrate that using orthogonal polynomial bases offers a favorable
tradeoff between model expressivity and training efficiency.

Result: 在M5基准和三个外部销售数据集上表现优于基线，提升了跨层次预测准确性。

Conclusion: 该框架为复杂预测环境中的泛化提升提供了简单有效的机制。

Abstract: Accurate demand forecasting is critical for supply chain optimization, yet
remains difficult in practice due to hierarchical complexity, domain shifts,
and evolving external factors. While recent foundation models offer strong
potential for time series forecasting, they often suffer from architectural
rigidity and limited robustness under distributional change. In this paper, we
propose a unified ensemble framework that enhances the performance of
foundation models for sales forecasting in real-world supply chains. Our method
combines two complementary strategies: (1) Hierarchical Ensemble (HE), which
partitions training and inference by semantic levels (e.g., store, category,
department) to capture localized patterns; and (2) Architectural Ensemble (AE),
which integrates predictions from diverse model backbones to mitigate bias and
improve stability. We conduct extensive experiments on the M5 benchmark and
three external sales datasets, covering both in-domain and zero-shot
forecasting. Results show that our approach consistently outperforms strong
baselines, improves accuracy across hierarchical levels, and provides a simple
yet effective mechanism for boosting generalization in complex forecasting
environments.

Conclusion: 微分神经元网络可作为积分神经元网络的潜在替代方案，为高能耗AI应用提供可持续解决方案。

Abstract: Reservoir Computing is a machine learning approach that uses the rich
repertoire of complex system dynamics for function approximation. Current
approaches to reservoir computing use a network of coupled integrating neurons
that require a steady current to maintain activity. Here, we introduce a small
world graph of differentiating neurons that are active only when there are
changes in input as an alternative to integrating neurons as a reservoir
computing substrate. We find the coupling strength and network topology that
enable these small world networks to function as an effective reservoir. We
demonstrate the efficacy of these networks in the MNIST digit recognition task,
achieving comparable performance of 90.65% to existing reservoir computing
approaches. The findings suggest that differentiating neurons can be a
potential alternative to integrating neurons and can provide a sustainable
future alternative for power-hungry AI applications.

Motivation: 当前的人工循环网络依赖隐式隐藏状态记忆，限制了可解释性和长距离依赖建模能力。受生物神经系统的启发，作者希望通过显式记忆机制改进这一点。

Method: ENN架构引入了显式、可微的记忆矩阵，结合Hebbian可塑性和稀疏注意力驱动的检索机制，动态建模记忆形成与回忆。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10和WikiText-103任务上，ENN表现与传统RNN、GRU和LSTM相当，同时显著提升了可解释性。

Conclusion: ENN展示了神经科学启发的机制在开发更透明、鲁棒的深度学习模型中的潜力。

Abstract: Despite success across diverse tasks, current artificial recurrent network
architectures rely primarily on implicit hidden-state memories, limiting their
interpretability and ability to model long-range dependencies. In contrast,
biological neural systems employ explicit, associative memory traces (i.e.,
engrams) strengthened through Hebbian synaptic plasticity and activated
sparsely during recall. Motivated by these neurobiological insights, we
introduce the Engram Neural Network (ENN), a novel recurrent architecture
incorporating an explicit, differentiable memory matrix with Hebbian plasticity
and sparse, attention-driven retrieval mechanisms. The ENN explicitly models
memory formation and recall through dynamic Hebbian traces, improving
transparency and interpretability compared to conventional RNN variants. We
evaluate the ENN architecture on three canonical benchmarks: MNIST digit
classification, CIFAR-10 image sequence modeling, and WikiText-103 language
modeling. Our empirical results demonstrate that the ENN achieves accuracy and
generalization performance broadly comparable to classical RNN, GRU, and LSTM
architectures, with all models converging to similar accuracy and perplexity on
the large-scale WikiText-103 task. At the same time, the ENN offers significant
enhancements in interpretability through observable memory dynamics. Hebbian
trace visualizations further reveal biologically plausible, structured memory
formation processes, validating the potential of neuroscience-inspired
mechanisms to inform the development of more interpretable and robust deep
learning models.

Motivation: CARPTDSC是一个NP难问题，且时间依赖性服务成本导致计算负担重，现有算法效率有限。

Method: 提出KGMA-GN算法，包含知识引导初始化策略（KGIS）和小步长局部搜索策略（KGSLSS），以减少无效计算。

Result: 在五个基准测试集上，KGMA-GN的搜索效率优于现有方法，局部搜索算子速度提升十倍以上。

Conclusion: KGMA-GN通过知识引导策略显著提高了CARPTDSC问题的求解效率。

Abstract: The capacitated arc routing problem with time-dependent service costs
(CARPTDSC) is a challenging combinatorial optimization problem that arises from
winter gritting applications. CARPTDSC has two main challenges about time
consumption. First, it is an NP-hard problem. Second, the time-dependent
service costs of tasks require frequent evaluations during the search process,
significantly increasing computational effort. These challenges make it
difficult for existing algorithms to perform efficient searches, often
resulting in limited efficiency. To address these issues, this paper proposes a
knowledge-guided memetic algorithm with golden section search and negatively
correlated search (KGMA-GN), where two knowledge-guided strategies are
introduced to improve search efficiency. First, a knowledge-guided
initialization strategy (KGIS) is proposed to generate high-quality initial
solutions to speed up convergence. Second, a knowledge-guided small-step-size
local search strategy (KGSLSS) is proposed to filter out invalid moves, thereby
reducing unnecessary evaluations and saving the computation time. Experimental
results on five benchmark test sets, including both small- and larger-scale
instances, demonstrate that KGMA-GN achieves higher search efficiency than the
state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the ablation study further confirms that
the knowledge-guided local search operators in KGSLSS can significantly reduce
runtime compared to traditional operators, especially for the knowledge-guided
swap operator, which achieves more than a tenfold improvement in speed.

Conclusion: VR是工业培训中可扩展、互动且高效的关键工具，优于传统方法。

Abstract: In contemporary training for industrial manufacturing, reconciling
theoretical knowledge with practical experience continues to be a significant
difficulty. As companies transition to more intricate and technology-oriented
settings, conventional training methods frequently inadequately equip workers
with essential practical skills while maintaining safety and efficiency.
Virtual Reality has emerged as a transformational instrument to tackle this
issue by providing immersive, interactive, and risk-free teaching experiences.
Through the simulation of authentic industrial environments, virtual reality
facilitates the acquisition of vital skills for trainees within a regulated and
stimulating context, therefore mitigating the hazards linked to experiential
learning in the workplace. This paper presents a sophisticated VR-based
industrial training architecture aimed at improving learning efficacy via
high-fidelity simulations, dynamic and context-sensitive scenarios, and
adaptive feedback systems. The suggested system incorporates intuitive
gesture-based controls, reducing the learning curve for users across all skill
levels. A new scoring metric, namely, VR Training Scenario Score (VRTSS), is
used to assess trainee performance dynamically, guaranteeing ongoing engagement
and incentive. The experimental assessment of the system reveals promising
outcomes, with significant enhancements in information retention, task
execution precision, and overall training efficacy. The results highlight the
capability of VR as a crucial instrument in industrial training, providing a
scalable, interactive, and efficient substitute for conventional learning
methods.

interaction efficiency, with multimodal large language models (MLLMs) emerging
as dominant paradigms in this domain. Current agents, however, are limited to
following explicit human instructions, resulting in insufficient capability for
proactive intent anticipation. Additionally, these agents fail to leverage the
contextual information associated with users during task execution, thereby
neglecting potentially vast differences in user preferences. To address these
challenges, we introduce the FingerTip benchmark. It contains two new tracks:
proactive task suggestions by analyzing environment observation and users'
previous intents, and personalized task execution by catering to users' action
preferences. We collected unique human demonstrations of multi-step Android
device interactions across a variety of everyday apps. These demonstrations are
not isolated but are continuously acquired from the users' long-term usage in
their real lives, and encompass essential user-related contextual information.
Our experiments reveal challenges of the tasks we propose. The model fine-tuned
with the data we collected effectively utilized user information and achieved
good results, highlighting the potential of our approach in building more
user-oriented mobile GUI agents. Our code is open-source at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FingerTip-57B8 for reproducibility.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: VizGenie是一个基于大型语言模型（LLM）的自改进框架，通过动态生成模块和自然语言接口提升科学可视化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决科学可视化中复杂任务的高认知负荷问题，结合领域工具与LLM灵活性，实现可持续进化的可视化实践。

Method: 结合预置工具与LLM生成脚本，通过自动化验证和视觉问答（VQA）增强交互，利用RAG确保可靠性。

Result: 在复杂体积数据集上显著降低迭代可视化任务的认知负荷，提升探索效率和可重复性。

Conclusion: VizGenie通过动态学习和用户交互，为科学可视化提供了灵活、可持续的解决方案。

Abstract: We present VizGenie, a self-improving, agentic framework that advances
scientific visualization through large language model (LLM) by orchestrating of
a collection of domain-specific and dynamically generated modules. Users
initially access core functionalities--such as threshold-based filtering, slice
extraction, and statistical analysis--through pre-existing tools. For tasks
beyond this baseline, VizGenie autonomously employs LLMs to generate new
visualization scripts (e.g., VTK Python code), expanding its capabilities
on-demand. Each generated script undergoes automated backend validation and is
seamlessly integrated upon successful testing, continuously enhancing the
system's adaptability and robustness. A distinctive feature of VizGenie is its
intuitive natural language interface, allowing users to issue high-level
feature-based queries (e.g., ``visualize the skull"). The system leverages
image-based analysis and visual question answering (VQA) via fine-tuned vision
models to interpret these queries precisely, bridging domain expertise and
technical implementation. Additionally, users can interactively query generated
visualizations through VQA, facilitating deeper exploration. Reliability and
reproducibility are further strengthened by Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG), providing context-driven responses while maintaining comprehensive
provenance records. Evaluations on complex volumetric datasets demonstrate
significant reductions in cognitive overhead for iterative visualization tasks.
By integrating curated domain-specific tools with LLM-driven flexibility,
VizGenie not only accelerates insight generation but also establishes a
sustainable, continuously evolving visualization practice. The resulting
platform dynamically learns from user interactions, consistently enhancing
support for feature-centric exploration and reproducible research in scientific
visualization.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于移动设备的工业辅助系统，支持实时、半免提交互，通过轻量级模块化流程实现隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业装配任务需要快速适应复杂流程和多样组件，但受限于计算、连接和隐私要求，传统云解决方案不适用。

Method: 集成轻量级目标检测、语音识别和RAG技术，构建全设备端模块化流程，并采用两阶段优化策略提升视觉鲁棒性。

Result: 在Gear8数据集上验证了领域偏移和视觉干扰的鲁棒性，用户研究显示其实际可行性和良好交互体验。

Conclusion: 该框架为工业环境提供了可部署的实时隐私保护智能辅助解决方案，并计划公开数据集和代码。

Abstract: Industrial assembly tasks increasingly demand rapid adaptation to complex
procedures and varied components, yet are often conducted in environments with
limited computing, connectivity, and strict privacy requirements. These
constraints make conventional cloud-based or fully autonomous solutions
impractical for factory deployment. This paper introduces a mobile-device-based
assistant system for industrial training and operational support, enabling
real-time, semi-hands-free interaction through on-device perception and voice
interfaces. The system integrates lightweight object detection, speech
recognition, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) into a modular on-device
pipeline that operates entirely on-device, enabling intuitive support for part
handling and procedure understanding without relying on manual supervision or
cloud services. To enable scalable training, we adopt an automated data
construction pipeline and introduce a two-stage refinement strategy to improve
visual robustness under domain shift. Experiments on our generated dataset,
i.e., Gear8, demonstrate improved robustness to domain shift and common visual
corruptions. A structured user study further confirms its practical viability,
with positive user feedback on the clarity of the guidance and the quality of
the interaction. These results indicate that our framework offers a deployable
solution for real-time, privacy-preserving smart assistance in industrial
environments. We will release the Gear8 dataset and source code upon
acceptance.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究探讨教育者如何通过定制GPT工具在定性研究方法课程中主动设计和使用生成式AI，以支持学科学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决学生作为被动AI使用者的主流观点，以及定性方法教育中AI应用不足的问题。

Method: 基于TPACK框架和行动研究方法，设计GPT工具支持研究问题制定、访谈练习等任务。

Result: 工具提升了学生的反思能力、访谈技巧和结构化分析思维，但也带来认知过载和数据沉浸不足的问题。

Conclusion: AI可作为主动学习的支架，定制GPT是迭代研究的认知伙伴，教育者主导设计对AI教育整合至关重要。

Abstract: As generative AI (Gen-AI) tools become more prevalent in education, there is
a growing need to understand how educators, not just students, can actively
shape their design and use. This study investigates how two instructors
integrated four custom GPT tools into a Masters-level Qualitative Research
Methods course for Urban Planning Policy students. Addressing two key gaps: the
dominant framing of students as passive AI users, and the limited use of AI in
qualitative methods education. The study explores how Gen-AI can support
disciplinary learning when aligned with pedagogical intent. Drawing on the
Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework and action
research methodology, the instructors designed GPTs to scaffold tasks such as
research question formulation, interview practice, fieldnote analysis, and
design thinking. Thematic analysis of student reflections, AI chat logs, and
final assignments revealed that the tools enhanced student reflexivity,
improved interview techniques, and supported structured analytic thinking.
However, students also expressed concerns about cognitive overload, reduced
immersion in data, and the formulaic nature of AI responses. The study offers
three key insights: AI can be a powerful scaffold for active learning when
paired with human facilitation; custom GPTs can serve as cognitive partners in
iterative research practice; and educator-led design is critical to
pedagogically meaningful AI integration. This research contributes to emerging
scholarship on AI in higher education by demonstrating how empowering educators
to design custom tools can promote more reflective, responsible, and
collaborative learning with AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统主要依赖手势或语音控制可视化，物理对象交互未被充分探索。

Method: 通过调查和研讨会确定可视化命令与物理操作的映射，开发了结合深度摄像头和Vision-LLM的原型InSituTale。

Result: 用户研究表明InSituTale支持直观交互，实用性强，并能提升叙事体验。

Conclusion: 增强物理数据叙事方法有效结合物理与数字元素，提升了数据叙事的互动性和吸引力。

Abstract: Augmented data storytelling enhances narrative delivery by integrating
visualizations with physical environments and presenter actions. Existing
systems predominantly rely on body gestures or speech to control
visualizations, leaving interactions with physical objects largely
underexplored. We introduce augmented physical data storytelling, an approach
enabling presenters to manipulate visualizations through physical object
interactions. To inform this approach, we first conducted a survey of
data-driven presentations to identify common visualization commands. We then
conducted workshops with nine HCI/VIS researchers to collect mappings between
physical manipulations and these commands. Guided by these insights, we
developed InSituTale, a prototype that combines object tracking via a depth
camera with Vision-LLM for detecting real-world events. Through physical
manipulations, presenters can dynamically execute various visualization
commands, delivering cohesive data storytelling experiences that blend physical
and digital elements. A user study with 12 participants demonstrated that
InSituTale enables intuitive interactions, offers high utility, and facilitates
an engaging presentation experience.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信任是社会关系的基础，随着电子交互增多，AI系统可能帮助用户理解社交状态。

Method: 研究LLMs在信任关系中的推理能力，并评估其通过角色扮演和行动规划诱导信任的效果。

Result: LLMs能够在一定程度上推理信任关系，并通过行动规划促进信任。

Conclusion: LLMs在理解与促进人际信任方面具有潜力，未来可进一步优化其应用。

Abstract: In human society, trust is an essential component of social attitude that
helps build and maintain long-term, healthy relationships which creates a
strong foundation for cooperation, enabling individuals to work together
effectively and achieve shared goals. As many human interactions occur through
electronic means such as using mobile apps, the potential arises for AI systems
to assist users in understanding the social state of their relationships. In
this paper we investigate the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason
about trust between two individuals in an environment which requires fostering
trust relationships. We also assess whether LLMs are capable of inducing trust
by role-playing one party in a trust based interaction and planning actions
which can instil trust.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI数据偏见导致全球7500万自闭症人群被边缘化，研究旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过实证实验，使用注释者和LLMs分析数据，开发AUTALIC基准。

Result: 90%类人AI代理排除自闭症视角，AUTALIC基准能有效评估模型。

Conclusion: 神经包容性AI是未来方向，AUTALIC为相关研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Biased data representation in AI marginalizes up to 75 million autistic
people worldwide through medical applications viewing autism as a deficit of
neurotypical social skills rather than an aspect of human diversity, and this
perspective is grounded in research questioning the humanity of autistic
people. Turing defined artificial intelligence as the ability to mimic human
communication, and as AI development increasingly focuses on human-like agents,
this benchmark remains popular. In contrast, we define Neuro-Inclusive AI as
datasets and systems that move away from mimicking humanness as a benchmark for
machine intelligence. Then, we explore the origins, prevalence, and impact of
anti-autistic biases in current research. Our work finds that 90% of human-like
AI agents exclude autistic perspectives, and AI creators continue to believe
ethical considerations are beyond the scope of their work. To improve the
autistic representation in data, we conduct empirical experiments with
annotators and LLMs, finding that binary labeling schemes sufficiently capture
the nuances of labeling anti-autistic hate speech. Our benchmark, AUTALIC, can
be used to evaluate or fine-tune models, and was developed to serve as a
foundation for more neuro-inclusive future work.

Method: 使用回归模型和自然语言处理技术分析关卡数据。

Result: 发现关卡风格、受欢迎程度、时间等特性及情感与难度有稳定关联。

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于区分简单与困难关卡，为理解用户设计提供基础。

Abstract: Games like Super Mario Maker 2 (SMM2) lower the barrier for casual users to
become level designers. In this paper, we set out to analyze a vast amount of
data about SMM2 user-written levels, in order to understand what factors affect
a level's difficulty as experienced by other users. To this end, we perform two
kinds of analyses: one based on regression models and one using natural
language processing techniques. The main results shed light on which level
characteristics (e.g., its style, popularity, timing) and which topics and
sentiments have a consistent association with easier or harder levels. While
none of our findings are startling, they help distill some key differences
between easy and hard SMM2 levels, which, in turn, can pave the way for a
better understanding of end-user level design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LGBTQ+青少年面临社交孤立和自杀风险，元宇宙支持小组可能提供匿名、安全的干预空间。

Method: 使用Cluster平台提供匿名、虚拟化身和可访问性支持，评估参与者的满意度、社交信心变化及适应情况。

Result: 79.2%参与者选择符合性别认同的化身，社交信心显著提升（p<0.001），虚拟环境在安全、表达和可访问性上评分更高。

Conclusion: 元宇宙支持小组有效降低心理障碍，但需与线下服务结合，未来研究应关注虚拟与现有社区/临床框架的整合。

Abstract: This study assessed metaverse-based support groups designed to reduce social
isolation and suicide risk among LGBTQ+ youths. Using the Cluster platform,
enhanced anonymity, avatar-based self-expression, and accessibility were
provided. Key findings showed that 79.2% chose avatars matching their gender
identity, reporting high satisfaction (mean: 4.10/5) and low discomfort (mean:
1.79/5). Social confidence significantly improved in virtual spaces compared to
real-world interactions (p<0.001), particularly among participants with
initially low confidence, averaging an increase of 2.08 points. About half of
the first-time participants were 16 or younger, highlighting potential for
early intervention. The metaverse scored higher than real-world environments
for safety/privacy (3.94/5), self-expression (4.02/5), and accessibility
(4.21/5). Additionally, 73.6% reported feeling more accepted virtually.
However, some highly confident individuals offline experienced mild adaptation
challenges, averaging a confidence decrease of 0.58 points, indicating virtual
support complements rather than replaces in-person services. These findings
suggest metaverse-based support effectively lowers psychological barriers and
provides affirming spaces, potentially reducing severe outcomes such as
suicidal ideation. Future studies should focus on integrating virtual support
with existing community and clinical frameworks to enhance long-term impacts.

Motivation: 研究解释行为中的情感作用，将其视为一种社会互动，关注解释者如何考虑听众的情感反应。

Method: 开发了一个计算框架，模拟解释者如何权衡解释对听众情感的影响，并以医生向患者解释疾病为例进行测试。

Result: 模型能较好地预测人类直觉，优于不考虑情感的基线模型，表明人们在解释时确实会考虑情感因素。

Conclusion: 情感在解释行为中扮演重要角色，计算框架为理解这一现象提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Why do we give the explanations we do? Recent work has suggested that we
should think of explanation as a kind of cooperative social interaction,
between a why-question-asker and an explainer. Here, we apply this perspective
to consider the role that emotion plays in this social interaction. We develop
a computational framework for modeling explainers who consider the emotional
impact an explanation might have on a listener. We test our framework by using
it to model human intuitions about how a doctor might explain to a patient why
they have a disease, taking into account the patient's propensity for regret.
Our model predicts human intuitions well, better than emotion-agnostic
ablations, suggesting that people do indeed reason about emotion when giving
explanations.

TL;DR: 论文提出并评估了两种情绪监测仪表板，旨在提升用户情绪意识并减少仇恨言论。研究发现这些工具有效，但也可能增加负面情绪表达。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管社交媒体平台采取了主动审核措施，但仍被批评为审查过度且未能解决不文明行为的根源。

Method: 通过211名参与者的研究，评估两种情绪监测仪表板对用户评论行为和情绪体验的影响。

Result: 干预措施提高了用户情绪意识并减少了仇恨言论，但也增加了敏感话题中的负面情绪表达。

Conclusion: 研究为社交媒体平台整合情绪调节工具提供了基础，以促进更健康的数字互动。

Abstract: Social media platforms increasingly employ proactive moderation techniques,
such as detecting and curbing toxic and uncivil comments, to prevent the spread
of harmful content. Despite these efforts, such approaches are often criticized
for creating a climate of censorship and failing to address the underlying
causes of uncivil behavior. Our work makes both theoretical and practical
contributions by proposing and evaluating two types of emotion monitoring
dashboards to users' emotional awareness and mitigate hate speech. In a study
involving 211 participants, we evaluate the effects of the two mechanisms on
user commenting behavior and emotional experiences. The results reveal that
these interventions effectively increase users' awareness of their emotional
states and reduce hate speech. However, our findings also indicate potential
unintended effects, including increased expression of negative emotions (Angry,
Fear, and Sad) when discussing sensitive issues. These insights provide a basis
for further research on integrating proactive emotion regulation tools into
social media platforms to foster healthier digital interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统影响个人和社会决策，培养批判性AI素养至关重要。传统方法如博客文章和社交媒体讨论往往无法支持深入理解和批判性思考。

Method: 通过一项包含605名参与者的对照研究，评估交互式AI教程对学习关键概念的影响，如公平性、数据集代表性和语言模型偏见。

Result: 交互式模拟显著提升了AI素养，支持知识迁移和自信心的增强，但单纯参与并不预测学习效果。

Conclusion: 交互式、探究驱动的方法能更好地帮助人们在日常生活中批判性地与AI互动。

Abstract: As AI systems shape individual and societal decisions, fostering critical AI
literacy is essential. Traditional approaches, such as blog articles, static
lessons, and social media discussions, often fail to support deep conceptual
understanding and critical engagement. This study examines whether interactive
simulations can help learners think like a scientist by engaging them in
hypothesis testing, experimentation, and direct observation of AI behavior. In
a controlled study with 605 participants, we assess how interactive AI
tutorials impact learning of key concepts such as fairness, dataset
representativeness, and bias in language models. Results show that interactive
simulations effectively enhance AI literacy across topics, supporting greater
knowledge transfer and self-reported confidence, though engagement alone does
not predict learning. This work contributes to the growing field of AI literacy
education, highlighting how interactive, inquiry-driven methodologies can
better equip individuals to critically engage with AI in their daily lives.

TL;DR: 研究表明，外部人机界面（eHMIs）能显著提升行人对L5自动驾驶系统的理解、安全感和信任度，促进更直观的交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球过半交通死亡事故涉及行人，L5自动驾驶系统可减少人为错误，但需明确如何通过eHMIs优化行人与系统的沟通。

Method: 通过在线调查，153名参与者评估了有无eHMIs时与L5自动驾驶系统的交互场景。

Result: 使用eHMIs时，行人更早、更自信地过马路，安全感和信任度显著提升，视觉eHMI功能（如文字显示和外部速度计）被认为更必要。

Conclusion: eHMIs能有效改善行人对L5自动驾驶意图的理解，增强安全感和信任，推动更自然的交互。

Abstract: Each year, over half of global traffic fatalities involve vulnerable road
users (e.g. pedestrians), often due to human error. Level-5 automated driving
systems (ADSs) could reduce driver errors contributing to pedestrian accidents,
though effectiveness depends on clarity and understandability for other road
users. External human-machine interfaces (eHMIs) have been proposed to
facilitate pedestrian-ADS communication, though consensus on optimal eHMI
features remains unclear. In an online survey, 153 participants responded to
road-crossing scenarios involving level-5 ADSs, with and without eHMIs. With
eHMIs, pedestrians crossed earlier and more confidently, and reported
significantly increased perceptions of safety, trust, and understanding when
interacting with level-5 ADSs. Visual eHMI features (including a text display
and external speedometer) were ranked more necessary than auditory ones, though
auditory cues received positive feedback. This study demonstrates that eHMIs
can significantly improve pedestrians' understanding of level-5 ADS intent and
enhance perceived safety and trust, facilitating more intuitive pedestrian-ADS
interactions.

Motivation: 现有可穿戴AI系统依赖用户主动触发或预定义任务知识，忽略了用户当前的心理状态。

Method: 基于认知理论建模工作记忆，利用编码机制（如置换和干扰）表示信息，并通过时间预测器平衡辅助价值与中断成本。

Result: 在12名参与者的实验中，ProMemAssist比基线LLM系统提供更精准的辅助，用户参与度更高。

Conclusion: 工作记忆建模能提供更细致、上下文敏感的辅助，为设计更智能的主动代理提供启示。

Abstract: Wearable AI systems aim to provide timely assistance in daily life, but
existing approaches often rely on user initiation or predefined task knowledge,
neglecting users' current mental states. We introduce ProMemAssist, a smart
glasses system that models a user's working memory (WM) in real-time using
multi-modal sensor signals. Grounded in cognitive theories of WM, our system
represents perceived information as memory items and episodes with encoding
mechanisms, such as displacement and interference. This WM model informs a
timing predictor that balances the value of assistance with the cost of
interruption. In a user study with 12 participants completing cognitively
demanding tasks, ProMemAssist delivered more selective assistance and received
higher engagement compared to an LLM baseline system. Qualitative feedback
highlights the benefits of WM modeling for nuanced, context-sensitive support,
offering design implications for more attentive and user-aware proactive
agents.

TL;DR: MindChat是一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的脑机接口（BCI）拼写器，通过减少手动按键次数显著提升了拼写效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统BCI拼写器因EEG解码不准确导致拼写错误率高，效率低下，限制了实际应用。

Method: 利用提示工程，通过GPT-4o等LLM提供上下文感知的单词和句子补全建议。

Result: 在线实验显示，MindChat比传统拼写器节省62%按键和32%拼写时间。

Conclusion: LLM增强的BCI拼写器有望推动实际应用。

Abstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) spellers can render a new communication
channel independent of peripheral nervous system, which are especially valuable
for patients with severe motor disabilities. However, current BCI spellers
often require users to type intended utterances letter-by-letter while spelling
errors grow proportionally due to inaccurate electroencephalogram (EEG)
decoding, largely impeding the efficiency and usability of BCIs in real-world
communication. In this paper, we present MindChat, a large language model
(LLM)-assisted BCI speller to enhance BCI spelling efficiency by reducing
users' manual keystrokes. Building upon prompt engineering, we prompt LLMs
(GPT-4o) to continuously suggest context-aware word and sentence
completions/predictions during spelling. Online copy-spelling experiments
encompassing four dialogue scenarios demonstrate that MindChat saves more than
62\% keystrokes and over 32\% spelling time compared with traditional BCI
spellers. We envision high-speed BCI spellers enhanced by LLMs will potentially
lead to truly practical applications.

Abstract: We investigate whether tactile charts support comprehension and learning of
complex visualizations for blind and low-vision (BLV) individuals and
contribute four tactile chart designs and an interview study. Visualizations
are powerful tools for conveying data, yet BLV individuals typically can rely
only on assistive technologies -- primarily alternative texts -- to access this
information. Prior research shows the importance of mental models of chart
types for interpreting these descriptions, yet BLV individuals have no means to
build such a mental model based on images of visualizations. Tactile charts
show promise to fill this gap in supporting the process of building mental
models. Yet studies on tactile data representations mostly focus on simple
chart types, and it is unclear whether they are also appropriate for more
complex charts as would be found in scientific publications. Working with two
BLV researchers, we designed 3D-printed tactile template charts with
exploration instructions for four advanced chart types: UpSet plots, violin
plots, clustered heatmaps, and faceted line charts. We then conducted an
interview study with 12 BLV participants comparing whether using our tactile
templates improves mental models and understanding of charts and whether this
understanding translates to novel datasets experienced through alt texts.
Thematic analysis shows that tactile models support chart type understanding
and are the preferred learning method by BLV individuals. We also report
participants' opinions on tactile chart design and their role in BLV education.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究探讨了生成式AI（GenAI）对学习者体验的影响，特别是在生物信息学领域的信息搜索行为中。发现GenAI在学习计划制定后有助于导航，但之前可能适得其反。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在跨学科领域如生物信息学中，学习者因背景差异大，面临复杂信息空间的挑战，GenAI的引入可能改变其信息搜索方式。

Method: 采用自民族志方法，研究GenAI聊天机器人如何影响学习者的导航行为和识别信息线索的能力。

Result: GenAI在学习计划明确后支持导航，但之前效果不佳；传统信息线索（如项目符号）在GenAI响应中效果较差。

Conclusion: 建议在跨学科学习环境中谨慎引入GenAI，需结合学习者背景调整使用策略。

Abstract: This full research paper investigates the impact of generative AI (GenAI) on
the learner experience, with a focus on how learners engage with and utilize
the information it provides. In e-learning environments, learners often need to
navigate a complex information space on their own. This challenge is further
compounded in interdisciplinary fields like bioinformatics, due to the varied
prior knowledge and backgrounds. In this paper, we studied how GenAI influences
information search in bioinformatics research: (1) How do interactions with a
GenAI chatbot influence learner orienteering behaviors?; and (2) How do
learners identify information scent in GenAI chatbot responses? We adopted an
autoethnographic approach to investigate these questions. GenAI was found to
support orienteering once a learning plan was established, but it was
counterproductive prior to that. Moreover, traditionally value-rich information
sources such as bullet points and related terms proved less effective when
applied to GenAI responses. Information scents were primarily recognized
through the presence or absence of prior knowledge of the domain. These
findings suggest that GenAI should be adopted into e-learning environments with
caution, particularly in interdisciplinary learning contexts.

TL;DR: 研究探讨AI素养和AI技术接触如何影响学生对AI评估工具Socratic Mind的感知，发现AI素养显著影响工具使用体验和学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI工具在教育中的普及，了解学生与AI系统的互动方式对支持有效学习至关重要。

Method: 基于自我决定理论和用户体验研究，通过问卷调查309名本科生，使用偏最小二乘结构方程模型分析数据。

Result: AI素养（自我效能、概念理解和应用技能）显著预测工具的可用性、满意度和参与度，进而影响学习效果；而先前的AI接触无显著影响。

Conclusion: AI素养是影响学生体验的关键因素，设计应支持不同素养水平，以创建包容且有效的AI学习环境。

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools become increasingly embedded in higher
education, understanding how students interact with these systems is essential
to supporting effective learning. This study examines how students' AI literacy
and prior exposure to AI technologies shape their perceptions of Socratic Mind,
an interactive AI-powered formative assessment tool. Drawing on
Self-Determination Theory and user experience research, we analyze
relationships among AI literacy, perceived usability, satisfaction, engagement,
and perceived learning effectiveness. Data from 309 undergraduates in Computer
Science and Business courses were collected through validated surveys. Partial
least squares structural equation modeling showed that AI literacy - especially
self-efficacy, conceptual understanding, and application skills - significantly
predicts usability, satisfaction, and engagement. Usability and satisfaction,
in turn, strongly predict perceived learning effectiveness, while prior AI
exposure showed no significant effect. These findings highlight that AI
literacy, rather than exposure alone, shapes student experiences. Designers
should integrate adaptive guidance and user-centered features to support
diverse literacy levels, fostering inclusive, motivating, and effective
AI-based learning environments.

*Stefan Graser,Martin Schrepp,Stephan Böhm*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究填补了AR设计建议的空白，通过多方法分析更新了数据集，并评估了其在企业培训中的适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究缺乏针对AR的上下文设计建议，尤其是在用户中心设计过程的评估阶段。

Method: 采用多方法分析，包括扩展数据集、NLP分类、内容总结和专家评估。

Result: 提供了597条设计建议，分类为84个主题，其中32个主题（284条建议）适用于AR企业培训。

Conclusion: 研究为AR用户体验测量方法提供了支持，有助于改进企业培训场景中的AR应用。

Abstract: Innovative technologies, such as Augmented Reality (AR), introduce new
interaction paradigms, demanding the identification of software requirements
during the software development process. In general, design recommendations are
related to this, supporting the design of applications positively and meeting
stakeholder needs. However, current research lacks context-specific AR design
recommendations. This study addresses this gap by identifying and analyzing
practical AR design recommendations relevant to the evaluation phase of the
User-Centered Design (UCD) process. We rely on an existing dataset of Mixed
Reality (MR) design recommendations. We applied a multi-method approach by (1)
extending the dataset with AR-specific recommendations published since 2020,
(2) classifying the identified recommendations using a NLP classification
approach based on a pre-trained Sentence Transformer model, (3) summarizing the
content of all topics, and (4) evaluating their relevance concerning AR in
Corporate Training (CT) both based on a qualitative Round Robin approach with
five experts. As a result, an updated dataset of 597 practitioner design
recommendations, classified into 84 topics, is provided with new insights into
their applicability in the context of AR in CT. Based on this, 32 topics with a
total of 284 statements were evaluated as relevant for AR in CT. This research
directly contributes to the authors' work for extending their AR-specific User
Experience (UX) measurement approach, supporting AR authors in targeting the
improvement of AR applications for CT scenarios.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文研究了利用生成式AI自动为视觉场景显示（VSD）配置热点，以帮助非专家用户高效创建AAC设备。研究结果显示，虽然效率提升，但也存在过度依赖和同质化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉场景显示（VSD）对无语言或语言能力有限的儿童有显著帮助，但其配置复杂限制了广泛应用。研究旨在通过生成式AI简化配置过程。

Method: 开发了一个原型，利用生成式AI自动建议图像热点，并通过用户研究（针对预备语言病理学家）评估其效果，关注创建时间、质量和用户信心。

Result: 结果显示用户效率提升且信心增强，但也存在过度依赖AI和沟通选项同质化的负面影响。

Conclusion: 生成式AI在辅助技术中的应用需进一步研究以解决潜在风险，如过度依赖和同质化问题。

Abstract: Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices are used by many
people around the world who experience difficulties in communicating verbally.
One AAC device which is especially useful for minimally verbal autistic
children in developing language and communication skills are visual scene
displays (VSD). VSDs use images with interactive hotspots embedded in them to
directly connect language to real-world contexts which are meaningful to the
AAC user. While VSDs can effectively support emergent communicators, their
widespread adoption is impacted by how difficult these devices are to
configure. We developed a prototype that uses generative AI to automatically
suggest initial hotspots on an image to help non-experts efficiently create
VSDs. We conducted a within-subjects user study to understand how effective our
prototype is in supporting non-expert users, specifically pre-service
speech-language pathologists (SLP) who are not familiar with VSDs as an AAC
intervention. Pre-service SLPs are actively studying to become clinically
certified SLPs and have domain-specific knowledge about language and
communication skill development. We evaluated the effectiveness of our
prototype based on creation time, quality, and user confidence. We also
analyzed the relevance and developmental appropriateness of the automatically
generated hotspots and how often users interacted with the generated hotspots.
Our results were mixed with SLPs becoming more efficient and confident.
However, there were multiple negative impacts as well, including over-reliance
and homogenization of communication options. The implications of these findings
reach beyond the domain of AAC, especially as generative AI becomes more
prevalent across domains, including assistive technology. Future work is needed
to further identify and address these risks associated with integrating
generative AI into assistive technology.

*Yotam Sechayk,Ariel Shamir,Amy Pavel,Takeo Igarashi*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: VeasyGuide通过动态高亮和放大教师动作，帮助低视力学习者更轻松地捕捉教学视频中的视觉线索，显著减少认知负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 教学视频中教师的视觉动作（如指向、标记）常缺乏语音描述，导致低视力学习者信息遗漏和认知负担增加。

Method: 与低视力学习者共同设计VeasyGuide工具，利用运动检测识别教师动作，动态高亮和放大，并提供个性化实时反馈。

Result: 8名低视力学习者测试显示，动作检测显著提升，响应时间缩短，认知负担降低；8名视力正常者也表现出更高的专注度。

Conclusion: VeasyGuide不仅对低视力学习者有益，也可能成为普遍适用的教学辅助工具。

Abstract: Instructors often rely on visual actions such as pointing, marking, and
sketching to convey information in educational presentation videos. These
subtle visual cues often lack verbal descriptions, forcing low-vision (LV)
learners to search for visual indicators or rely solely on audio, which can
lead to missed information and increased cognitive load. To address this
challenge, we conducted a co-design study with three LV participants and
developed VeasyGuide, a tool that uses motion detection to identify instructor
actions and dynamically highlight and magnify them. VeasyGuide produces
familiar visual highlights that convey spatial context and adapt to diverse
learners and content through extensive personalization and real-time visual
feedback. VeasyGuide reduces visual search effort by clarifying what to look
for and where to look. In an evaluation with 8 LV participants, learners
demonstrated a significant improvement in detecting instructor actions, with
faster response times and significantly reduced cognitive load. A separate
evaluation with 8 sighted participants showed that VeasyGuide also enhanced
engagement and attentiveness, suggesting its potential as a universally
beneficial tool.

Conclusion: 该框架和设计提供了可操作的见解，有助于改进选举信息的传播和理解。

Abstract: Visualizations are essential tools for disseminating information regarding
elections and their outcomes, potentially influencing public perceptions.
Personas, delineating distinctive segments within the populace, furnish a
valuable framework for comprehending the nuanced perspectives, requisites, and
behaviors of diverse voter demographics. In this work, we propose making
visualizations tailored to these personas to make election information easier
to understand and more relevant. Using data from UK parliamentary elections and
new developments in Large Language Models (LLMs), we create personas that
encompass the diverse demographics, technological preferences, voting
tendencies, and information consumption patterns observed among
voters.Subsequently, we elucidate how these personas can inform the design of
visualizations through specific design criteria. We then provide illustrative
examples of visualization prototypes based on these criteria and evaluate these
prototypes using these personas and LLMs. We finally propose some actionable
insights based upon the framework and the different design artifacts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理在复杂现实任务中表现不佳，主要因缺乏对移动应用的实际了解，导致任务规划低效甚至产生幻觉。

Method: 提出轨迹记忆机制，将任务执行轨迹转化为结构化页面记忆库；采用粗到细的任务规划方法，检索相似页面并注入LLM规划器。

Result: 实验证明MapAgent在现实场景中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MapAgent通过记忆增强和上下文感知规划，显著提升了任务自动化效果，代码将开源。

Abstract: The recent advancement of autonomous agents powered by Large Language Models
(LLMs) has demonstrated significant potential for automating tasks on mobile
devices through graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Despite initial progress,
these agents still face challenges when handling complex real-world tasks.
These challenges arise from a lack of knowledge about real-life mobile
applications in LLM-based agents, which may lead to ineffective task planning
and even cause hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
LLM-based agent framework called MapAgent that leverages memory constructed
from historical trajectories to augment current task planning. Specifically, we
first propose a trajectory-based memory mechanism that transforms task
execution trajectories into a reusable and structured page-memory database.
Each page within a trajectory is extracted as a compact yet comprehensive
snapshot, capturing both its UI layout and functional context. Secondly, we
introduce a coarse-to-fine task planning approach that retrieves relevant pages
from the memory database based on similarity and injects them into the LLM
planner to compensate for potential deficiencies in understanding real-world
app scenarios, thereby achieving more informed and context-aware task planning.
Finally, planned tasks are transformed into executable actions through a task
executor supported by a dual-LLM architecture, ensuring effective tracking of
task progress. Experimental results in real-world scenarios demonstrate that
MapAgent achieves superior performance to existing methods. The code will be
open-sourced to support further research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐喻可视化动画能增强抽象数据的理解和用户参与度，但设计过程中存在语义对齐、数据表示和交互集成等挑战。

Method: 提出了一种人机协作工作流程，利用VLMs生成动画片段，并根据实体顺序、属性值、空间布局或随机性协调时间线。

Result: 开发了原型DataSway，并通过用户研究验证了其创意支持和可用性，展示了6个案例的应用。

Conclusion: 为未来定制化数据可视化动画研究提供了启示。

Abstract: Animating metaphoric visualizations brings data to life, enhancing the
comprehension of abstract data encodings and fostering deeper engagement.
However, creators face significant challenges in designing these animations,
such as crafting motions that align semantically with the metaphors,
maintaining faithful data representation during animation, and seamlessly
integrating interactivity. We propose a human-AI co-creation workflow that
facilitates creating animations for SVG-based metaphoric visualizations. Users
can initially derive animation clips for data elements from vision-language
models (VLMs) and subsequently coordinate their timelines based on entity
order, attribute values, spatial layout, or randomness. Our design decisions
were informed by a formative study with experienced designers (N=8). We further
developed a prototype, DataSway, and conducted a user study (N=14) to evaluate
its creativity support and usability. A gallery with 6 cases demonstrates its
capabilities and applications in web-based hypermedia. We conclude with
implications for future research on bespoke data visualization animation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于随机最优控制的方法，用于同时优化电池系统的充电状态控制和状态估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电池系统的充电状态通常通过非线性观测模型估计，导致状态估计的可观测性变化。为提高估计精度和控制效果，需要一种新方法。

Method: 采用随机最优控制（双控制）方法，优先选择通过高可观测性区域的轨迹，从而提升未来测量质量。

Result: 在数值模拟的多电池系统中，算法在控制目标和状态估计误差上均表现出统计显著的改进。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了电池系统的控制性能和状态估计精度，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: The state of charge of battery systems is an important metric typically
estimated by observation models, represented by open-circuit voltage graphs.
These observation models are often nonlinear in the state of charge, resulting
in varying observability from a state estimation perspective. In this paper, we
employ a stochastic optimal control (also known as dual control) approach to
simultaneously satisfy the control objective in the state of charge of battery
systems and improve estimation accuracy. This is achieved implicitly by
prioritizing trajectories that pass through high-observability regions of the
state space, thereby improving the quality of future measurements. We apply our
algorithm to a numerical simulation of a multi-battery system and show a
statistical improvement in both the control objective and the state estimation
error.

Result: 提出了有效的控制方法，即使在测量误差下也能收敛。

Conclusion: 该方法在理论和数值上均验证了其有效性，为振荡器分布控制提供了新思路。

Abstract: We address the problem of steering the phase distribution of oscillators all
receiving the same control input to a given target distribution. In a large
population limit, the distribution of oscillators can be described by a
probability density. Then, our problem can be seen as that of ensemble control
with a constraint on the steady-state density. In particular, we consider the
case where oscillators are subject to stochastic noise, for which the
theoretical understanding is still lacking. First, we characterize the
reachability of the phase distribution under periodic feedforward control via
the Fourier coefficients of the target density and the phase sensitivity
function of oscillators. This enables us to design a periodic input that makes
the stationary distribution of oscillators closest to the target by solving a
convex optimization problem. Next, we devise an ensemble control method
combining periodic and feedback control, where the feedback component is
designed to accelerate the convergence of the distribution of oscillators. We
exhibit some convergence results for the proposed method, including a result
that holds even under measurement errors in the phase distribution. The
effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by a numerical example.

Abstract: We provide experimental validation, in a pair of vehicles, of a recently
introduced predictor-based cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) design,
developed for achieving delay compensation in heterogeneous vehicular platoons
subject to long actuation delays that may be distinct for each individual
vehicle. We provide the explicit formulae of the control design that is
implemented, accounting for the effect of zero-order hold and sampled
measurements; as well as we obtain vehicle and string stability conditions
numerically, via derivation of the transfer functions relating the speeds of
pairs of consecutive vehicles. We also present consistent simulation results
for a platoon with a larger number of vehicles, under digital implementation of
the controller. Both the simulation and experimental results confirm the
effectiveness of the predictor-based CACC design in guaranteeing individual
vehicle stability, string stability, and tracking, despite long/distinct

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提出的控制器具有高效性、适应性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该控制策略在多智能体系统中表现出优越的跟踪性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: This letter proposes a deep neural network (DNN)-based neuro-adaptive sliding
mode control (SMC) strategy for leader-follower tracking in multi-agent systems
with higher-order, heterogeneous, nonlinear, and unknown dynamics under
external disturbances. The DNN is used to compensate the unknown nonlinear
dynamics with higher accuracy than shallow neural networks (NNs) and SMC
ensures robust tracking. This framework employs restricted potential functions
within a set-theoretic paradigm to ensure system trajectories remain bounded
within a compact set, improving robustness against approximation errors and
external disturbances. The control scheme is grounded in non-smooth Lyapunov
stability theory, with update laws derived for both inner and outer layer
network weights of DNN. A numerical example is simulated that showcases the
proposed controller's effectiveness, adaptability, and robustness.

Abstract: Efficient greenhouse management is essential for sustainable food production
in response to a growing global population. However, maintaining optimal indoor
climates requires significant energy and resources, making advanced control
systems critical for economic viability and environmental sustainability.
Traditional greenhouse models are often complex and imprecise, limiting the
effectiveness of conventional control strategies. To address these challenges,
this study investigates data-driven predictive control methods using Gated
Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. Our
experiments showed that GRU-based predictive control reduced temperature and
humidity violations by up to 5\% and required 40\% less computation time than
the LSTM approach, all while maintaining equivalent economic performance and
crop yield. These findings demonstrate that GRU-based predictive control offers
a more efficient and practical solution for real-time greenhouse climate
regulation in precision agriculture.

Abstract: With the large-scale integration of electric vehicles (EVs) in the
distribution grid, the unpredictable nature of EV charging introduces
considerable uncertainties to the grid's real-time operations. This can
exacerbate load fluctuations, compromise power quality, and pose risks to the
grid's stability and security. However, due to their dual role as controllable
loads and energy storage devices, EVs have the potential to mitigate these
fluctuations, balance the variability of renewable energy sources, and provide
ancillary services that support grid stability. By leveraging the bidirectional
flow of information and energy in smart grids, the adverse effects of EV
charging can be minimized and even converted into beneficial outcomes through
effective real-time management strategies. This paper explores the negative
impacts of EV charging on the distribution system's real-time operations and
outlines methods to transform these challenges into positive contributions.
Additionally, it provides an in-depth analysis of the real-time management
system for EV charging, focusing on state estimation and management strategies.

Conclusion: 分层博弈框架在多智能体自动驾驶场景中具有显著优势。

Abstract: This paper develops a game-theoretic decision-making framework for autonomous
driving in multi-agent scenarios. A novel hierarchical game-based decision
framework is developed for the ego vehicle. This framework features an
interaction graph, which characterizes the interaction relationships between
the ego and its surrounding traffic agents (including AVs, human driven
vehicles, pedestrians, and bicycles, and others), and enables the ego to
smartly select a limited number of agents as its game players. Compared to the
standard multi-player games, where all surrounding agents are considered as
game players, the hierarchical game significantly reduces the computational
complexity. In addition, compared to pairwise games, the most popular approach
in the literature, the hierarchical game promises more efficient decisions for
the ego (in terms of less unnecessary waiting and yielding). To further reduce
the computational cost, we then propose an improved hierarchical game, which
decomposes the hierarchical game into a set of sub-games. Decision safety and
efficiency are analyzed in both hierarchical games. Comprehensive simulation
studies are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed frameworks,
with an intersection-crossing scenario as a case study.

Abstract: We propose a framework that enables autonomous vehicles (AVs) to proactively
shape the intentions and behaviors of interacting human drivers. The framework
employs a leader-follower game model with an adaptive role mechanism to predict
human interaction intentions and behaviors. It then utilizes a branch model
predictive control (MPC) algorithm to plan the AV trajectory, persuading the
human to adopt the desired intention. The proposed framework is demonstrated in
an intersection scenario. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of
the framework for generating persuasive AV trajectories despite uncertainties.
