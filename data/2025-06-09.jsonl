Field demos were\nconducted in two commercial orchards in MI, USA, with different canopy\nstructures. The system achieved success rates of 0.807 and 0.797, with an\naverage picking cycle time of 5.97s. The proposed strategy reduced harvest time\nby 28% compared to a single-arm baseline. The dual-arm harvesting robot\nenhances the reliability and efficiency of apple picking. With further\nadvancements, the system holds strong potential for autonomous operation and\ncommercialization for the apple industry."}

Vector Quantization (VQ), a\nclustering-based quantization method, serves as a prevalent solution to this\nissue for its extremely low-bit (even at 2-bit) and considerable accuracy.\nSince a vector is a quantity in mathematics and physics that has both direction\nand magnitude, existing VQ works typically quantize them in a coupled manner.\nHowever, we find that direction exhibits significantly greater sensitivity to\nquantization compared to the magnitude. For instance, when separately\nclustering the directions and magnitudes of weight vectors in LLaMA-2-7B, the\naccuracy drop of zero-shot tasks are 46.5\\% and 2.3\\%, respectively. This gap\neven increases with the reduction of clustering centers. Further, Euclidean\ndistance, a common metric to access vector similarities in current VQ works,\nplaces greater emphasis on reducing the magnitude error. This property is\ncontrary to the above finding, unavoidably leading to larger quantization\nerrors. To these ends, this paper proposes Polar Coordinate Decoupled Vector\nQuantization (PCDVQ), an effective and efficient VQ framework consisting of two\nkey modules: 1) Polar Coordinate Decoupling (PCD), which transforms vectors\ninto their polar coordinate representations and perform independent\nquantization of the direction and magnitude parameters.2) Distribution Aligned\nCodebook Construction (DACC), which optimizes the direction and magnitude\ncodebooks in accordance with the source distribution.

MOSAIC combines three\nmechanisms: (1) modular policy composition via neural network masks, (2) cosine\nsimilarity estimation using Wasserstein embeddings for knowledge selection, and\n(3) asynchronous communication and policy integration. Results on a set of RL\nbenchmarks show that MOSAIC has a greater sample efficiency than isolated\nlearners, i.e., it learns significantly faster, and in some cases, finds\nsolutions to tasks that cannot be solved by isolated learners. The\ncollaborative learning and sharing dynamics are also observed to result in the\nemergence of ideal curricula of tasks, from easy to hard. These findings\nsupport the case for collaborative learning in agentic systems to achieve\nbetter and continuously evolving performance both at the individual and\ncollective levels."}

This\nevolution is driven by commercial trends emphasizing sensor integration and by\na surge of academic interest exploring novel sensing capabilities. Building on\nthe foundation established by earlier surveys, this work presents a timely and\ncomprehensive review of earable research published since 2022. We analyze over\none hundred recent studies to characterize this shifting research landscape,\nidentify emerging applications and sensing modalities, and assess progress\nrelative to prior efforts. In doing so, we address three core questions: how\nhas earable research evolved in recent years, what enabling resources are now\navailable, and what opportunities remain for future exploration. Through this\nsurvey, we aim to provide both a retrospective and forward-looking view of\nearable technology as a rapidly expanding frontier in ubiquitous computing. In\nparticular, this review reveals that over the past three years, researchers\nhave discovered a variety of novel sensing principles, developed many new\nearable sensing applications, enhanced the accuracy of existing sensing tasks,\nand created substantial new resources to advance research in the field.

However, imitation learning typically involves humans collecting data\nusing demonstration devices that emulate a robot's embodiment and visual\ncondition. This raises the question of how such devices influence gaze\nbehavior. We propose an experimental framework that systematically analyzes\ndemonstrators' gaze behavior across a spectrum of demonstration devices. Our\nexperimental results indicate that devices emulating (1) a robot's embodiment\nor (2) visual condition impair demonstrators' capability to extract\ntask-relevant cues via gaze behavior, with the extent of impairment depending\non the degree of emulation. Additionally, gaze data collected using devices\nthat capture natural human behavior improves the policy's task success rate\nfrom 18.8% to 68.8% under environmental shifts."}

These\ncontinuous variations lead to fluctuating acoustic transfer distributions,\nmaking it challenging to represent with basic data structures and render\nefficiently in real time. To address this challenge, we present Neural Acoustic\nTransfer, a novel approach that utilizes an implicit neural representation to\nencode precomputed acoustic transfer and its variations, allowing for real-time\nprediction of sound fields under varying conditions. To efficiently generate\nthe training data required for the neural acoustic field, we developed a fast\nMonte-Carlo-based boundary element method (BEM) approximation for general\nscenarios with smooth Neumann conditions.

These methods provide the necessary training data, enabling our\nneural network to accurately model the sound radiation space. We demonstrate\nour method's numerical accuracy and runtime efficiency (within several\nmilliseconds for 30s audio) through comprehensive validation and comparisons in\ndiverse acoustic transfer scenarios.

Yet, successful navigation still relies on two key\ncapabilities: mapping and planning, whether explicit or implicit. Classical\napproaches use explicit mapping pipelines to register ego-centric observations\ninto a coherent map frame for the planner. In contrast, end-to-end learning\nachieves this implicitly, often through recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that\nfuse current and past observations into a latent space for planning. While\narchitectures such as LSTM and GRU capture temporal dependencies, our findings\nreveal a key limitation: their inability to perform effective spatial\nmemorization. This skill is essential for transforming and integrating\nsequential observations from varying perspectives to build spatial\nrepresentations that support downstream planning. To address this, we propose\nSpatially-Enhanced Recurrent Units (SRUs), a simple yet effective modification\nto existing RNNs, designed to enhance spatial memorization capabilities.

The most popular UAVs are\nquadcopters that use a set of four motors, arranged as two on either side with\nopposite spin. An autonomous UAV is called a drone. Drones have been in service\nin the US army since the 90's for covert missions critical to national\nsecurity. It would not be wrong to claim that drones make up an integral part\nof the national security and provide the most valuable service during\nsurveillance operations. While UAVs are controlled using wireless signals,\nthere reside some challenges that disrupt the operation of such vehicles such\nas signal quality and range, real time processing, human expertise, robust\nhardware and data security. These challenges can be solved by programming UAVs\nto be autonomous, using object detection and tracking, through Computer Vision\nalgorithms. Computer Vision is an interdisciplinary field that seeks the use of\ndeep learning to gain a high-level understanding of digital images and videos\nfor the purpose of automating the task of human visual system. Using computer\nvision, algorithms for detecting and tracking various objects can be developed\nsuitable to the hardware so as to allow real time processing for immediate\njudgement. This paper attempts to review the various approaches several authors\nhave proposed for the purpose of autonomous navigation of UAVs by through\nvarious algorithms of object detection and tracking in real time, for the\npurpose of applications in various fields such as disaster management, dense\narea exploration, traffic vehicle surveillance etc."}

We find that language models\nundergo loss deceleration early in training; an abrupt slowdown in the rate of\nloss improvement, resulting in piecewise linear behaviour of the loss curve in\nlog-log space. Scaling up the model mitigates this transition by (1) decreasing\nthe loss at which deceleration occurs, and (2) improving the log-log rate of\nloss improvement after deceleration. We attribute loss deceleration to a type\nof degenerate training dynamics we term zero-sum learning (ZSL). In ZSL,\nper-example gradients become systematically opposed, leading to destructive\ninterference in per-example changes in loss. As a result, improving loss on one\nsubset of examples degrades it on another, bottlenecking overall progress. Loss\ndeceleration and ZSL provide new insights into the training dynamics underlying\nlanguage model scaling laws, and could potentially be targeted directly to\nimprove language models independent of scale.

We depart from this paradigm by studying CP in a\nquery only setting, where prediction sets must be constructed solely from\nfinite queries to a black box generative model, introducing a new trade off\nbetween coverage, test time query budget, and informativeness. We introduce\nConformal Prediction with Query Oracle (CPQ), a framework characterizing the\noptimal interplay between these objectives. Our finite sample algorithm is\nbuilt on two core principles: one governs the optimal query policy, and the\nother defines the optimal mapping from queried samples to prediction sets.\nRemarkably, both are rooted in the classical missing mass problem in\nstatistics. Specifically, the optimal query policy depends on the rate of\ndecay, or the derivative, of the missing mass, for which we develop a novel\nestimator.

Observing how humans understand a manipulation task, we find\nthat understanding how the objects should move in the 3D space is a critical\nclue for guiding actions. This clue is embodiment-agnostic and suitable for\nboth humans and different robots. Motivated by this, we aim to learn a 3D flow\nworld model from both human and robot manipulation data. This model predicts\nthe future movement of the interacting objects in 3D space, guiding action\nplanning for manipulation. Specifically, we synthesize a large-scale 3D optical\nflow dataset, named ManiFlow-110k, through a moving object auto-detect\npipeline.

When no such pairing\nexists, as is the case when generating data from noise, training flows is much\nharder. A popular approach lies in picking source and target points\nindependently. This can, however, lead to velocity fields that are slow to\ntrain, but also costly to integrate at inference time. In theory, one would\ngreatly benefit from training flow models by sampling pairs from an optimal\ntransport (OT) measure coupling source and target, since this would lead to a\nhighly efficient flow solving the Benamou and Brenier dynamical OT problem.

Recent works have shown\npromising results in estimating part pose and size at the category level.\nHowever, these approaches primarily follow a complex multi-stage pipeline that\nfirst segments part instances in the point cloud and then estimates the\nNormalized Part Coordinate Space (NPCS) representation for 6D poses. These\napproaches suffer from high computational costs and low performance in\nreal-time robotic tasks. To address these limitations, we propose YOEO, a\nsingle-stage method that simultaneously outputs instance segmentation and NPCS\nrepresentations in an end-to-end manner. We use a unified network to generate\npoint-wise semantic labels and centroid offsets, allowing points from the same\npart instance to vote for the same centroid. We further utilize a clustering\nalgorithm to distinguish points based on their estimated centroid distances.\nFinally, we first separate the NPCS region of each instance.

However, by building\non recent advances in 3D models such as neural radiance fields, some authors\nhave shown that 3D techniques can at last improve outputs extracted from\nindependent 2D views, by fusing them into 3D and denoising them. This is\nparticularly helpful in egocentric videos, where the camera motion is\nsignificant, but only under the assumption that the scene itself is static. In\nfact, as shown in the recent analysis conducted by EPIC Fields, 3D techniques\nare ineffective when it comes to studying dynamic phenomena, and, in\nparticular, when segmenting moving objects. In this paper, we look into this\nissue in more detail. First, we propose to improve dynamic segmentation in 3D\nby fusing motion segmentation predictions from a 2D-based model into layered\nradiance fields (Layered Motion Fusion). However, the high complexity of long,\ndynamic videos makes it challenging to capture the underlying geometric\nstructure, and, as a result, hinders the fusion of motion cues into the\n(incomplete) scene geometry. We address this issue through test-time\nrefinement, which helps the model to focus on specific frames, thereby reducing\nthe data complexity. This results in a synergy between motion fusion and the\nrefinement, and in turn leads to segmentation predictions of the 3D model that\nsurpass the 2D baseline by a large margin.

PartCrafter builds upon a pretrained 3D mesh\ndiffusion transformer (DiT) trained on whole objects, inheriting the pretrained\nweights, encoder, and decoder, and introduces two key innovations: (1) A\ncompositional latent space, where each 3D part is represented by a set of\ndisentangled latent tokens; (2) A hierarchical attention mechanism that enables\nstructured information flow both within individual parts and across all parts,\nensuring global coherence while preserving part-level detail during generation.\nTo support part-level supervision, we curate a new dataset by mining part-level\nannotations from large-scale 3D object datasets. Experiments show that\nPartCrafter outperforms existing approaches in generating decomposable 3D\nmeshes, including parts that are not directly visible in input images,\ndemonstrating the strength of part-aware generative priors for 3D understanding\nand synthesis. Code and training data will be released."}

Due to\nheavy computational cost, much interest has aroused for compressing vision\ntransformer dynamically in the aspect of tokens. Current methods mainly pay\nattention to token pruning or merging to reduce token numbers, in which tokens\nare compressed exclusively, causing great information loss and therefore\npost-training is inevitably required to recover the performance. In this paper,\nwe rethink token reduction and unify the process as an explicit form of token\nmatrix transformation, in which all existing methods are constructing special\nforms of matrices within the framework. Furthermore, we propose a many-to-many\nToken Transforming framework that serves as a generalization of all existing\nmethods and reserves the most information, even enabling training-free\nacceleration. We conduct extensive experiments to validate our framework.\nSpecifically, we reduce 40% FLOPs and accelerate DeiT-S by $\\times$1.5 with\nmarginal 0.1% accuracy drop. Furthermore, we extend the method to dense\nprediction tasks including segmentation, object detection, depth estimation,\nand language model generation.

The authors of these studies compared\ntheir schemes to determine the best one. The initial measure used to assess the\ngoodness of a polygonal approximation was figure of merit. Later, it was\npointed out that this measure was not an appropriate metric for a valid reason\nand this is why Rosin - through mathematical analysis - introduced a measure\ncalled merit. However, this measure involves optimal scheme of polygonal\napproximation and so it is time-consuming to compute it to assess the goodness\nof an approximation. This led many researchers to use weighted figure of merit\nas a substitute for Rosin's measure to compare among sub-optimal schemes. An\nattempt is made in this communication to investigate whether the two measures -\nweighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure - are related so that one can be\nused instead of the other and towards this end theoretical analysis,\nexperimental investigation and statistical analysis are carried out.

Fine-tuning techniques enable practitioners to adapt\nfoundation models for many new applications but require expensive and lengthy\ntraining while being notably sensitive to hyper-parameter choices. To overcome\nthese limitations, we introduce Text-to-LoRA (T2L), a model capable of adapting\nLarge Language Models on the fly solely based on a natural language description\nof the target task. T2L is a hypernetwork trained to construct LoRAs in a\nsingle inexpensive forward pass. After training T2L on a suite of 9 pre-trained\nLoRA adapters (GSM8K, Arc, etc.), we show that the ad-hoc reconstructed LoRA\ninstances match the performance of task-specific adapters across the\ncorresponding test sets. Furthermore, T2L can compress hundreds of LoRA\ninstances and zero-shot generalize to entirely unseen tasks.

In this paper, we address a challenge\nassociated with such eigenspectrum methods: the impact of the aspect ratio of\nweight matrices on estimated heavytailness metrics. We demonstrate that\nmatrices of varying sizes (and aspect ratios) introduce a non-negligible bias\nin estimating heavytailness metrics, leading to inaccurate model diagnosis and\nlayer-wise hyperparameter assignment.

It requires simultaneous capture of both phenological\ndynamics (obtained from multi-temporal satellite data like Sentinel-2) and\nsubtle spectral variations (demanding nanometer-scale spectral resolution from\nhyperspectral imagery). Research combining these two modalities remains scarce\ncurrently due to challenges in hyperspectral data acquisition and crop types\nannotation costs. To address these issues, we construct a hierarchical\nhyperspectral crop dataset (H2Crop) by integrating 30m-resolution EnMAP\nhyperspectral data with Sentinel-2 time series. With over one million annotated\nfield parcels organized in a four-tier crop taxonomy, H2Crop establishes a\nvital benchmark for fine-grained agricultural crop classification and\nhyperspectral image processing. We propose a dual-stream Transformer\narchitecture that synergistically processes these modalities. It coordinates\ntwo specialized pathways: a spectral-spatial Transformer extracts fine-grained\nsignatures from hyperspectral EnMAP data, while a temporal Swin Transformer\nextracts crop growth patterns from Sentinel-2 time series. The designed\nhierarchy classification heads with hierarchical fusion then simultaneously\ndelivers multi-level classification across all taxonomic tiers. Experiments\ndemonstrate that adding hyperspectral EnMAP data to Sentinel-2 time series\nyields a 4.2% average F1-scores improvement (peaking at 6.3%). Extensive\ncomparisons also confirming our method's higher accuracy over existing deep\nlearning approaches for crop type classification and the consistent benefits of\nhyperspectral data across varying temporal windows and crop change scenarios.\nCodes and dataset will be available at https://github.com/flyakon/H2Crop and\nwww.glass.hku.hk\n  Keywords: Crop type classification, precision agriculture, remote sensing,\ndeep learning, hyperspectral data, Sentinel-2 time series, fine-grained crops"}

Among various\nassembly tasks, geometric assembly--where broken parts are reassembled into\ntheir original form (e.g., reconstructing a shattered bowl)--is particularly\nchallenging. This requires the robot to recognize geometric cues for grasping,\nassembly, and subsequent bimanual collaborative manipulation on varied\nfragments. In this paper, we exploit the geometric generalization of\npoint-level affordance, learning affordance aware of bimanual collaboration in\ngeometric assembly with long-horizon action sequences. To address the\nevaluation ambiguity caused by geometry diversity of broken parts, we introduce\na real-world benchmark featuring geometric variety and global reproducibility.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach over both\nprevious affordance-based and imitation-based methods.

Martins"], "title": "Movie Facts and Fibs (MF$^2$): A Benchmark for Long Movie Understanding", "comment": "Under Review", "summary": "Despite recent progress in vision-language models (VLMs), holistic\nunderstanding of long-form video content remains a significant challenge,\npartly due to limitations in current benchmarks. Many focus on peripheral,\n``needle-in-a-haystack'' details, encouraging context-insensitive retrieval\nover deep comprehension. Others rely on large-scale, semi-automatically\ngenerated questions (often produced by language models themselves) that are\neasier for models to answer but fail to reflect genuine understanding. In this\npaper, we introduce MF$^2$, a new benchmark for evaluating whether models can\ncomprehend, consolidate, and recall key narrative information from full-length\nmovies (50-170 minutes long). MF$^2$ includes over 50 full-length,\nopen-licensed movies, each paired with manually constructed sets of claim pairs\n-- one true (fact) and one plausible but false (fib), totalling over 850 pairs.\nThese claims target core narrative elements such as character motivations and\nemotions, causal chains, and event order, and refer to memorable moments that\nhumans can recall without rewatching the movie. Instead of multiple-choice\nformats, we adopt a binary claim evaluation protocol: for each pair, models\nmust correctly identify both the true and false claims. This reduces biases\nlike answer ordering and enables a more precise assessment of reasoning. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that both open-weight and closed state-of-the-art\nmodels fall well short of human performance, underscoring the relative ease of\nthe task for humans and their superior ability to retain and reason over\ncritical narrative information -- an ability current VLMs lack."}
